One tells only the truth.


The other tells only lies.


They both knock cups off the table.
Well... almost lol. They switched places for the present photo. Little stinkers!
Just gonna show us this picture but not tell us their names? ok then.
Cutest re-enactment of “The Shining” I’ve ever seen.
Wow lol well done. Is that some extra effort to recreate with the toilet rolls or is that just how you always stack them? Impressed me either way lol
so weird that you can see who the female/male are as if they're in an animated movie lol
They’re...they’re backwards...

*WHY MUST YOU TORTURE ME SO*????
Are you...are you on the toilet?
Thank you Super Glue!
Swap the cats
Almost
Nope. Cats are not aligned.
I’m pooping in the bathroom in my house and my dog is biting my pants
So close...they are reversed
Wow. That must have been like herding ca.....oh. Yeah.  Impressive work.
But they switched positions
stac era sdrawkcab
r/PastAndPresentPics
Hahaha almost! They have to switch places
No. Your cats are in opposite positions. Please try again.
They're not in the right spots, you gotta do it over again. 

... Just kidding, this is beautiful! It kinda also looks like they matured in general, not just growing bigger, in how their poses just seem more confident and alert compared to the slouchy kitties. I love these before and after photos!
r/fromkittentocat would like this
What are the weird glowy marking on the side of the bathroom units - directly under the cats.
They're still judging you.
They're reversed! So cute :P
They swapped places.
Backwards
Not quite, cats are the wrong way round.
They have grown up so beautifully.
Are you in the bathtub? They look concerned.
You got it backwards.
Older but reversed
Never did fix that drawer though... 😂
/r/mildlyinfuriating they're swapped
We have the same shower curtain.
Awww, what sweet and precious kitties.
It’s crazy to think how difficult it would be to make them switch back. The moment you try to move them they will likely abandon the photoop altogether
Aww, I love them!
Nope.  They switched sides.beautiful puddy tats
The double tail tuck!
They are on the wrong side of each other.  Quite adorable nonetheless
Aw, they switched spots. 💚💚💚
Cats are the wrong way around
The cats look like there in the wrong place the one where there baby’s the cat that has the coloured fur on its face is on the right but when there adults the one with the fur above it’s face is on the right but if they grew up switching there appearance comment
You must not have tried real hard if you settled on this picture with the cats backward
Adorable 😍😍😍😍😍
Adorably swapped in place. But oh well. Names please. 😊
cats judging us from on high
They are so pretty!
/r/Bondedpairs
The effort for this picture deserves all the upvotes in the world
adorable as babies, beautiful as adults! I should get a cat...
What's the emoji in the title and why doesn't my font have it?  grumble grumble.
They are precious! Also, your vanity is really nice!
Successful cat herding. Bravo!!
Majestic kitties. Are they brother and sister?
I love how the toilet paper is in the exact same place lol
SO CUTE 😭
Still together after all these years
New toothbrush?
Cats are backwards
Please tell me this photo is taken from sitting on the toilet
They're on the wrong side.  lol
🥰🥰🥰
Woo the cats switched faces that’s amazing!!!
Great job!!
Come play with us
r/pastandpresentpics
They switched places
This is really cool.
They’ve switched places! 😻
It's mirrored.
Were these siblings adopted together? Too cute!
I hate to break it to you...
owwwww.  Almost.  They are backwards.
I see we have r/FromKittenToCat
Cats are on the wrong side, 2/10.
i feel the two cats swapped in position
They switched sides
But you didn't. They're not standing on the same side as the original.
I cannot accept in the second pic they are in an other order
[deleted]
They switcjed places
The two cats are flipflopped
They switch place so you failed.
Do you think cats get deja vu?
Worth the wait!  Adorable.
omg perfection
No no the right one is on the left. I want my cookie now
You switched them
But... but they're switched!
They are the wrong way around and it bothers me.
To Cute 💜
U fucked it up
Nope, they’re backwards, check out the faces.
But you didn't....
It’s adorable but too bad they weren’t in the original spot
You often find yourself looking up from the bathroom floor, I see...
Mirrored image
Cute 🥰
I've never seen The Shining. Are these the twins from The Shining? 😆
Penis face!
Must have taken many tries, worth it
We’re going to need to know their names
Adorbs 😸
Congratulations on raising such cuties 🐾🧸
Really cool, looks like a pokemon evolution to me!
Nice!
Someone please edit it so they’re in the same position in both pics
Oh my goodness 😂😍😍
Aww!
Beautiful and adorable ❤️
OMG I LOVE THEM!!!!!!!!
Now that’s a gang i would join.
But....but the one on the right is so big he's hiding the lotion bottle and---and---and the chord is white, not black!!! 😱😉😛😻
So cute!  I can’t believe you managed it, an amazing feat!  10/10
Boy and a girl?
Purrrty good!
Come play with us
Cute!
Older, wiser and still judging you from the same vantage point.
"they've
The sneer.
Awesome job beautiful cats frame this for sure
They recreated it. The idea was planted in your head. Don't fool yourself into thinking you're the brains.
So puuurrrfect
The one on the right looks like trouble.
The placement is just wrong
Bless You Cat-Lova!!!!
Mmm, nop
I can’t imagine how hard this was to do
You are the best of reddit. Wow I love this so much.

Brother and sister? Or sisters? Hard to be sure.

ps. opposite sides tho, OCD is ~twitching~
Looks backwards
Parsing.
I have two barn cats ( Suge and Night)  that look nearly identical.
bathkeepers
I’m impressed by the toilet paper being stacked the same way on the shelf in both.
Doesn’t count.
So who saw the cat last
I have the same drawer pulls in my kitchen
Very Cute. But all I can see is that the toilet paper on the shelf hasn't moved.
you can even see the light bulbs wearing out lol
Ride or dies
I want to upvote this like 20 times!
Please tell me one of them is named Batman. Lol
Come play with us!!

omg soo cute
You never change the TP do you
Cats probably "if we do as he wants and don't move, it will bring joy to him. I'm sure he's got temptations in his pockets".
Why is she cheering?

She's so weird... shuttup she feeds us be nice.
You have a new box of tissues and you got a new toothbrush. Change your shower curtain tho, it might be secretly filthy 🤣
Twins
How many years was that? Your bathroom haven't change!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I know that stare. You’re taking a bath.... or a ___.
Even the orbs are in the same spot!
I was wondering where all the toilet paper went 🤣🤣🙃
Come and play with us, Danny...
H h h h h h h h h h h h h how do you expect us to believe this when the toiletries don't match?
*Mungojerry aaaand Rumpleteaser! They’re a notorious couple a cats!*
No they’re opposite!!! Lol
Cool to see the difference in how much that drawer hangs lower.
nah they on the wrong sides
For almost a full minute I thought it was just one cat in the mirror
So stinkin cute!!
Doesn’t count. Their on the wrong sides
They are sooo adorable!
I love how you can tell they switched spots not only by their faces, but by their general posture lol.
Geez, even cats go to the bathroom together!🙄
Awwwww!! So cuuuuute.
Ugly
Tell them I love them 😍
You mean you mirrored it :) pretty cool by the way!
r/unfortunaterecreation
K congrats?
At first I thought it was one kitty and its’ reflection
Oh. My. God. 😭
You’re sitting on your toilet, aren’t you?
Look, the human is puking again.
I love this! Are they litter mates?
Ooomg sooo cuuute! 😍
Your highness ❤️
Lovvvvveeeee
they went from tiny babies to big babies
Their noses are reversed, oh my god I love them
They're switched
What cuties!
Always had trouble telling cat genders apart but this is helpful
Curious what variety of cat that is? I see them all over reddit, and the one I just adopted is nearly identical.
flexin
How many years apart are the pics?
This is super cute
Hate to break to you...
The one on the left looks like the trouble maker
😭💕💕
Different order. Did you think were not going to noticed that, haha. Nice pic, btw ;)
I’m surprised you didn’t use any of the toilet paper.
Omg such cuties 😻
They are mixed up positions-wise, awesome still
Youngsters all grown up
essa mulher nao caga os papel nem saiu do lugar ou os gato creçeu de repente
2 agents of chaos.
THEY ARE SO PRETTY
Almost recreated...
One looks distinctly feminine and the other masculine, is that accurate?
I see you got a new toothbrush!
So cute 😍
Yo buddy can I touch that bodankadon 😳
Cute cats
If I didn't know better I'd think we were related. I gave a pair just like that to my nephew and niece several months ago. And yes, I know you're not them. I checked your post history to be sure.
What kind of witchery convinces two cats to sit side by side without moving or attacking something? 'Tis marvelous indeed.
Great photos, super cute. Down voted because they are switched.
So cute!
The tissue box in the back: 👀
Congratulations! You have successfully herded cats!
A mirror image, if you will.
Oh look...a mirror image.
Nice
Reducibility is very high
Are those the same rolls of toilet paper?
getting cats to cooperate, that's something
Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit!!!!!!!!
They switched spots....
adorable
Aww!
They are on the wrong sides
That’s just to show you how quickly those expensive sonic toothbrushes break down. 😆
Oh they’ve perfected their judgment, though
They switched spots though, right?
Close, but they switched sides! jk, This is adorable.
Are they sisters? So adorable. :)
They are elegant 😌
They switched spots!
Pretty kitties 🐱😻
TLC’s “Trading ~Faces~”
Your lightbulbs are the only thing dirty in there unless you changed them all between pics.
As of the toilet paper hasn't moved !
i don’t get what’s wrong with the post, can someone explain?
They grow up so fast! Beautiful
Aw man, almost 😅 they switched spots but I still love it!
I love this, they are adorable 🥰
Nice
When your mirrored image is mirrored, you've practically got a cat torrent.
I think that they are ummm how do I say it.......switched
Your bathroom is nice
How adorable
It's scary how everything is in the same place
I absolutely thought that there was only one cat for a second and I was like, what kind of mirror does that??
Himbs big nose
I love the changing of the tiny details in both photos, new electric toothbrush 😍😍
So cute, it's crazy how fast they grow up! I still can't believe my pups are turning 3 this year.
Sink Gaurdians have reached Level 2!
"meow. hooman, we are hungry. we demand our food bowls to be refilled to the brim, since we have eaten one little chunk 5 minutes ago. meow."
"The council will decide you fate."
Nice new toothbrush
Some one don't use toilet paper
AND THANK YOU FOR DOING SO! This is adoooorrrrable. :)
Cute!
You should make a bathroom only fans
Nope. Chuck Testa.
It's like one of those "circle the differences" pictures
They’re such adorable kitties!! Are they tabbies mixed with something else? I’d love to adopt cats like them, especially with the pink lil nose (they’re both adorable though)
Awwwe!!! How sweet!!!
The shining twins?
I’d bet you have one of the most upvoted posts with emojis ever on Reddit too. So many accomplishments.
one is white charger, one is black
Look at those SWEET KITTIES
You kept your toilet paper rolls in the exact same place all this time ?
Friends forever
Wrong way round
cute cats💗.
for pet lovers and people who looking for adoptions [https://www.reddit.com/r/adorablepet/](https://www.reddit.com/r/adorablepet/)
And it is beautiful.
so cute
I want to pet them so bad!
I love how you can see different personalities on their faces! They are both very gorgeous pair of rascals
Wow nice cats
Omg this is adorable
The cats switched sides!
They are so pretty !
Next you can do taxidermy version of photo.
Almost! But omg they are so cute!!
We’ve found it, the borderline between pretty and handsome for cats
cats seem..bigger so not a true recreation
and you've been trying since the first one havent you?
People looking if the person lost something in the old photo to the new photo and spotted the rainbow tissue box
Like the Grady sisters in “The Shining”
Cuuuute!!!!
Cute and so adorable ❤️😍🥺
The council will decide your fate
*Find 5 differences.*
*But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?*
This auto gave me “ the shinning vibes” of the creepy twins, for some reason lol
its like those memes of people making pictures the same as there old pictures
Amazing 😻
How many treats were needed for this?
So absolutely adorable!
i saved this image as duplicat
Beautiful cats.
Awww! Mine have discovered that they can get to the highest shelf. They redecorate the bathroom with TP shreds every night.
This is amazing. I love it! Funny how the babies have the same expression.
Wow... strong resemblance with my twin cats. Question is - is one of them gay too?
No, they’re the wrong way around. Do it again.
Nice
That's so cute. Getting them to pose at all must have been a challenge. Well done.
The toothbrush is wrong.

The curtain is wrong.

The soap is wrong.

The cats are reversed and their tails are wrong.

The shed above the tissue paper so wrong.
Hehe its always funny and adorable when I see a cat with a dick on its face. 😂
 Then stop clogging your mouth with drivel and tell me...did the portal open? Was it the unity?
From incels to chads
They are backwards
Except they switched positions
Almost.
Except they swapped places
