The graffiti though. Nice!
Anyone else think that the dog was gonna cartwheel?

Edit: Why the hell is this shit getting so much fucking attention.
The good ole‚Äô dog crushing my groin trick, gets em every time
I always ask myself, how the fuck do they come up with this and start to train something like that.
Does he wake up one day, goes to the dog looks at it, gets the feeling "yeah,yeah you'll do it!" stand on his hand for 5 minutes until the dog figures out hot to balance himself? I'll never know, but kudos to the dude and his doggo.
Oh great! Now the dogs have us doing the tricks! What's the world coming to?!
It‚Äôs a backward walkover, but that was pretty cool and funny anyway! [Wikipedia link](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_walkover)
So this is what Mose is up to while Dwight is at work.
Aside from the "wtf?" factor it's pretty impressive.
Do you live a on a beet farm by chance?
That's the most flexible dude in overalls I have ever seen.
I taught my dog "down" today and I felt like a genius until I saw this.
Dude out there posing backbreaking moves like JoJo characters.
At what point does it stop being a dog trick and turn into a human trick involving a dog?
Man, Cousin Moe looking good out here
Everyone else at the farm: ‚Äúthat boy ain‚Äôt right‚Äù
I wish I was that dog right now
/r/Upvotebecauseboy
Never saw a sexier gymnast.  Love the whole package including the boots!
Crikey! This is gorgeous!
That was so cool! Now do me next!
That's gotta feel ... funny.
This is called a back-walkover not a cartwheel of any sort. Still adorable.
 Not sure who impressed me more
How many times did this dog crush your balls doing that?
That‚Äôs not a cartwheel.  That‚Äôs a back walkover.
Mad lad
Wierd squirrel you got there!
He‚Äôs achieving symbiosis!
I NEED to see this in real life. It is so adorable!
Cartwheels are sideways. They look like the spokes of a cart going around. That was a backwards walkover.
Did I just witness farmer brown execute a flawless backbend walkover while a chiuwahwah pug thing casually strolls over his nether regions
First time ever seen this done with a scruffy guy in overalls. Usually is an attractive young female in a leotard
The world could use more French Bulldog graffiti
I'm desperately looking for a dog like this dog's breed. My first dog was exactly like this and she was the smartest and sweetest doggo but I never knew the exact mix. I know it's heavily mixed but if anyone can shed some light on it i'd be very grateful.
I think this guy was doing the half time show at the warriors game a couple days ago with this dog. The dog was awesome. He would run on the basketball.
Super cute
Not a backward cartwheel, this is a backwards walkover! Great trick :^)
Does the word, "cartwheel" mean different things in different countries? Because this doesn't look like any cartwheel I have ever seen.
Not a cartwheel: back walkover
That's sick 

Cartwheel? No.

Entertaining? Indeed.
Just so you know it‚Äôs called a ‚Äúback walk over‚Äù not a ‚Äúbackward cartwheel‚Äù. Still very impressive though!!
this is like some cirque du soleil shit
Those must be Chuck Norris Action Overalls!
That‚Äôs not a cartwheel, that‚Äôs a back walkover.
That's not a cartwheel. That's called a back walkover. Source: Former gymnast.
That's a back walkover...
It‚Äôs called a back walkover for anyone wondering
I didn‚Äôt know the property brother was so flexible!

This guy was just at the Toronto Maple Leaf game doing his show in the first intermission last night.  He‚Äôs got some unreal upper body strength.

I‚Äôm more impressed with this guy‚Äôs back walkover. And in overalls no less!
That is not a backward cartwheel. That is called a back walkover. 

A cartwheel does not involve a back bend.
Aaron Rodgers had a farm. EIEIOOOO
Look What I Taught My Human!
‚ÄúBackward cartwheel‚Äù lol it‚Äôs a back walkover
Aaron Rodgers has strange hobbies.
I‚Äôm more impressed with this dudes backbend kickover.
I see you picking up new tricks in the offseason, AARON RODGERS
Looks like the dude from ‚ÄúThe Servant‚Äù and ‚ÄúBlack Mirror‚Äù. Lol, so many people are going to try this and fail now.
The dog had to walk on his ball sack to do that
I hate that I‚Äôm late to this thread because no one seems to know the difference between a backbend kickover and a backwalkover. As a former gymnast it‚Äôs very painful to see all these incorrect ‚Äúcorrections‚Äù being made.
Things you never thought you'd see a full grown man in rubber boots and overalls
When did Moes get a dog?
Back walkover* but still awesome
its called a back walkover, but its still really cool!
I'd like to see it edited so that the camera is always lined up with his head
This is actually amazing
Damn nice back bend bro
Wtf a Farmer and a Gymnast!
Backbend?lol
Is this the guy from the Las Vegas Opium show?
What kind of parrot is that
We have found the missing [link](https://theoffice.fandom.com/wiki/The_Schrute_Family) He's the one who's closest to being acclimated with a modern/socially interactive society. You could almost say he was...the NORMAL Schrute.
That is a back walk over
Woah! Is this Mose Schrute talent show?
That‚Äôs a backward walkover
Soon I will walk by the yoga studio next door where people wear hilarious stuff.  I will think of this man.
My  back died
My dog can only piss on the devan. A cat in a swell. XD
I have the worst back pain rn and the first thing I see is this SMH lol
TRADE alert!
Back walkover. Still just as impressive!
Aaah, this kind of content always makes my day a little better. Can't explain how much I enjoy these type of things. Hope everyone's having a lovely day
Amazing! You and your dog are very skilled! keep it up!
Acrobatics call that a back walkover üëçüèª
Is this Pikachu?
This. This is the content I‚Äôm here for.
Ok will you both marry me!?
That would be a back walkover
So this is what Mose gets up to while Dwight's at the office..
Btw it‚Äôs a back walkover. For those who don‚Äôt know
I love how dogs go along with our shenanigans. They're just as immature as us lol
Dude wins every limbo line at every party

This video is fake.

I like the idea of a dexterous shoulder perched animal personally.. we should have more dogs, cats, foxes, ferrets, rats, and bunnies that are willing to do this ü•∞
Backward cartwheel?! LOL. Who the heck came up with that?? It‚Äôs a back walkover. Cute lil trick tho. Totally thought the dog was gonna be doing some kind of flip, not the human.
This should also go in r/toptalent
Amazing. Ya'll are so talented!! ü§©
Am i alone in feeling a little anxious when his dog steps around his private area. Nice trick btw
Thought the dog was gonna poop on his face for a second there.
He's like a pikachu
I will never know if my dog can do this
I guess it's safe doing that on the grass... the monsters won't hear a thing.
Coming to a halftime show near you!
This is mesmerizing to look at
Wow. If I tried this my back would just snap like a twig.
Wryy
Ahhh, so THIS is doggy heaven!
Ooh you should also post in r/barkour and r/animalsBeingGeniuses
Imagine how many times it went horribly wrong before this moment of perfection...
This is definitely some hipster shit.

Lol seriously how do you maintain composure when he steps on them haha
Great trick man
If I tried this with my cat, I would need multiple organ transplants.
Mose?
Nice mountain goat
Good boy.
Alright, now switch and do it again.
How do you even get your dog to do this?

"Step right up, folks, and have a look at Gary, the world's most flexible farmer!  Women adore him!  Men admire him!  Vegetables tremble in fear!"
I want to live where you do.
Mose, after the "Office"
I see a lot of people getting technical and calling it a back walkover but if we getting SUPER technical, that was a kick over and a back walkover would be if he did it in one fluid motion kicking his leg up with him as he bent backwards. 

Also this video is so wholesome and beautiful I wanna save it.
Cool
My cat would do something like this
crazy
What are talking about, that's a parrot!

Is this Mose?
Is this going on at Schrute Farms?
Now do it full speed and see what you both are really made of.
Hey!!! Watch the nuts!
You're doing cartwheels.  

The dog is playing The Grass Is Lava.
I couldn‚Äôt do that normally let alone with a dog running around on me
The first acrobatic chicken in the world! ü§°üêì
Would that legit hurt a dude? I didn't think they were *that* sensitive but I'm a woman so I have no idea.
This is awesome but I really hoped for the dog to poop on his face at 0:04.

Lol it‚Äôs called a back walkover, but I like backward cartwheel ;)
How do you discover you have this talent
I wanna do this someday with my dog but I'm not flexible XD
[dogs are the best people](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ-fvr2qLc0)
I find it more interesting that you do this effortlessly in coveralls lol.

That's adorable. Love it.
How do you find out you can do this?! Also I was very concerned that dog was going to step on his balls and the ending of the video would be wildly different lmao
what a good boy!! or gal
Aktwally, that's a back walkover, but whatever
How do you discover the dog can do that?
How are his crown jewels safe?
Crazy lol

OH MY FUCKEN GOD
That was a backhand spring not a cartwheel it was pretty much a backflip
That‚Äôs not normal.
this is doing jym
What is farmer life?!
Most dogs chase balls, but the dogs in the background look like they're tripping balls instead.
that is a back walk over, no cartwheel.
Omg that background mural.
Now do a flip.
Young man, do this once a day, and you will never grow old and feeble.
That's called a backbends kickover. But I do agree backward cartwheel sounds cooler. 

Source: I was a gymnastic coach.
I didn't realise it was a magic trick?
That was pretty impressive.
I came here to inevitably find someone pointing this out, but I did not see it. I really love the reaction of the dog in the background in their dog field thing.
How do you even go about training a dog to do this?
Alright Dary
It‚Äôs called a backbend kick over. Me= gymnast.
This dog looks exactly like mine! I was wondering how my puppy got so talented
I love everything about this.
Have you had gymnastics training?!
Could've been a decent opportunity for Catwheel
Did you just call it a backwards cartwheel?
Back walkover
Isn‚Äôt this a back walk over not a cartwheel?
I would love to see this in reverse!
Me too, dog, me too.

Looks exactly like the dog my wife and I adopted, actually it could be the same dog! Would explain a lot of his current behavior.
I did not expect a man in muck boots and overalls to move that gracefully.
Good thing he isn't working with a cat.
Where does this hottie live?
Can‚Äôt tell if that dog thinks it‚Äôs part cat or part goat
Back walkover (not cartwheel), but rad nonetheless!
That's so cool. Who is he and his sweet pup?
That guy has skills
Awh that‚Äôs cute
I call this move: ‚Äúwalk the taint‚Äù
That's amazing

I legit thought the dog was gonna fall ngl
The trick is to send both legs back at the same time which also sends the pup to a new location

Wonder if this is the guy I was at the Opium show in Vegas.
Everything in gymnastics is some type of cartwheel I guess

I thought this was Red Dead glitching up.
I dunno why, but the paint job on that house is making me so happy...

This is really freaking cute, but I can't get over the fact that that was a back hand-spring, not a cartwheel.
How long it take to master that?

We need to call Dwight and tell him his long lost cousin Mose has been found.
Cute! The dog's not bad either.
This is some European ass shit
You call it a backwards cartwheel, when it's not a cartwheel, a cartwheel is going to the side, this is just awesome gymnastics
Nice job Mose
Oh farm boy, grab that pitcher... With your foot
I wish Krasinski just stuck to comedy instead of insisting on desperately trying to show his range.
The dog: FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFU
Wouldn't it technically be considered a sideways cartwheel? Since cartwheels are sideways to being with
i can‚Äôt even do a cartwheel by myself, much less with a dog on me lmao
Even the next doors dog was impressed.
Honey good boy

Does this mean Honey Boy is based on true events, really impressive.

Must be that farm where all the good bois go to
That‚Äôs one talented pooch! I mean, human doing a back walk-over, ok not bad. But, a dog using a human as a treadmill is an entirely different thing! That pup is going places!
That's legit cool AF.
And here I've been yelling at my dog when she walks on my balls.
But first you must get castrated so the dog doesn‚Äôt crush your balls mid-trick.

The dog obviously too, but also that this guy can pull that move!
this whole thing is so calming to me. The doggo, the art in the background, the very good looking man in what I for some reason find a really attractive outfit ‚Äî then there‚Äôs the picturesque buildings and the gentle sunlight and what looks like really soft grass. It‚Äôs got a very comfortable tone and feel to it. Just looks like a nice place to be.

Back walkover. There is no such thing as a backwards cartwheel. Nice dog

That‚Äôs actually a back handspring but it‚Äôs super cool nonetheless!
That's a back-bend walk-over. This is one of the further things from a cartwheel...

That‚Äôs not a cartwheel lol that‚Äôs a back walk over ( and an awesome one at that)
Pretty sure it's called a walk over, but yes
It‚Äôs a back walkover!
What the heck did I just see
Omg
"Backward cartwheel" lmao. But that was pretty cool.
Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs more impressive, the man doing this in overalls and boots or the dog.
Mose is pretty athletic, wouldn‚Äôt have guessed
Dog‚Äôs a mountain goat.
Downward dog
Coga is country yoga
My dog wudnt even stand on my shoulders..
It's called a back walkover (cartwheels are a sideways engagement), and it was great to see a farmer in overalls do it so gracefully.
Tall rednecks freak me out. I say this as an average sized one.
The dog sexually touched him
holy you are softÔΩû
That guy has too much free time to be:

1. Learning how to do a backward cartwheel.

2. Teaching his dog to walk on him while doing said backward cartwheel.

3. Painting giant murals of said dog on side of barn in background.

Said.
Anyone else thought dog was gonna poop on his face?
Who the fuck calls that a cartwheel
For a second I thought the dog will bite his dick
He was trying to give himself a blow job and things went terribly wrong.
I was kinda hoping that the dog was going to bite his nuts.  Never mind, wrong sub
