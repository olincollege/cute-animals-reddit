Congratulations! Gus looks thrilled!
You know that‚Äôs right.

I‚Äôm so happy for you!! Train him to sit in his own seat first tho! Trust me! And get him a car harness! Much safer
Cute lil guy tho!
If you're going to get a dog, buy a safe transport Box right away. Like that, if u have an accident and the airbag goes off, your puppy will get crushed between you and the airbag.
Reddit loves Gus. 

But Gus needs to learn to sit in the back and wear a doggy seatbelt. 

Also, tell Gus he's a massively cute little fellow.

Congrats. Don't drive with a dog in your lap for fucks sake.
*Gus entered the life*

***

*Wiggle wiggle*
Why does this subs titles always follow the same formula?

*Some random backstory* ALWAYS followed by "Reddit, meet [NAME]"
Congrats and good luck to u and you‚Äôre wife! Love him every day and he will do the same
Perhaps it is short for Burton ‚ÄúOilcan‚Äù Guster?
Bruton Gaster approves.
He looks so happy!
[deleted]
He legit looks he's straight out of a movie
Tell gus I love him
Gus looks so happy :) so glad you and your wife were finally able to get a dog. They are such a wonderful positive energy to have around. Feed them lots of love and you'll get it back tenfold.

BEST. DESICION. EVER.
This picture is stupid. Get ther dog off your lap of you're driving. And you've got a metal leash on him IN the car,if something happens that leash can get tangled.


I can understand not ignoring certain precautions but a lot of it is common sense. Would you drive with a toddler on your lap?
Gus fucking rules
Gus looks like a G
You know that‚Äôs right!
He looks so ready to chew everything you own.  Congratulations!
Sup' Gus!
Can I call him Ghee Buttersnaps?
Yaaaaaaaay!
You will call him Gussy and Gus Gus. Also Gussy Goo. I'm an expert...source: We have our own Gus
I see an image of a dog on his chest.  I wonder what Rorschach would say about that.  He is the goodest boy.  Enjoy him.
Me and my SO are also waiting to get a doggo as soon as we leave our apt! I dream about that day, It's nice to know we're not the only ones that have had to put that dream on hold.

What kind of dog is he? 

Congratulations! Gus is so cute! And definitely a name on our list :)
Congrats! And what a great name üòÅ
Dogs are the best!
Gus looks like a very happy pup ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Gus looks like a wonderful addition to any pack
Oh Gus Gus how cute you are
Long life and good health, OP. Have big fun.

 "On Talking (sic) Terms With Dogs - Calming Signals" by Turid Rugaas

I have been a devoted dogfriend for almost six decades. This book taught me more in an hour than I had learned in three quarters of a lifetime.

Peace
Dogs always seem so happy when they‚Äôre hot.
I have a Gus! Got him 7 years ago from the shelter (Shepard mix). Best wishes to you and your Gus.
1 month into our first apartment that accepted pets, we adopted our dog. Priorities.
Wow you look so excited!
Day coot
Now get Gus a good harness.
I love the dog's face that it's making
Come on son 


Wait for iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit
This is wholesome
Gus looks like he's not really sure what's going on but he sure is happy about it. Hope he loves his furever home!
I FEEL YOU. Congrats!!!!!!!!!
He‚Äôs gonna be a good boy!
So cute! Hi Gus. He looks so happy.
he said :D
Someone‚Äôs excited to be going home with you!
Gus, you are beautiful. üíú
Also bought a house to get a dog about 3 years ago.  Amazing decision.  Might get another couple houses and another dog for each.
I‚Äôd die for Gus. ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
Okay but you like like Anakin Skywalker
So your just gonna melt our hearts with no warning huh?
So adorable!
I just want someone to look at me like that üò≠
Hello Gus! You look very cute and you're very lucky to own this family because im sure they love you much. I hope, you have a loonngg and healthy life with your family üñ§
Ah man we are so almost there! 
We rented for 12 years and couldnt get a dog. 
Finally bought a house last year but garden needed full renovation. 
Almost finished that (myself) and started looking for our new puppy. 
Lost my job due to Coronavirus. üò∞
So waiting until I can find employment again, then the search for our Forever Friend is back on...! üôè
Be careful! We bought a house and ended up with 4 dogs 2 cats and no children. Been married for 18 years üòä
I love him
Hi Gus, you look like you're going to be a handful LoL

Good luck and train him as much at possible when people.. They're little sponges
I would die for gus
My childhood dog‚Äôs name was Gus. Such a sweet boy. My parents had him longer than they had me. Lived to be 15 and died when I was 11. That was painful. I still think about him often.
 you had 6 years to think of a name and you picked Gus
We're going on 11 years of the same thing. Congrats on finding a more inclusive place, and on the pupper!
Love the Honda!!!
I've been looking to move to the town I work in. If they don't accept cats, then they don't accept me. I am not giving up my cat for a place. I'll commute.
Airbag goes splooge.
Gus is going to shit all over your walls, that dog will track it all over the floor and onto
your goddamn couch!

...sorry, just projecting from this morning‚Äôs fiasco...
[deleted]
How adorable, Congratulations!!
This is the dream my friend! Hope you three have a happy life together.
Wow! 'You are all going to have such a good future together you can see it in his face.
What a winning smile!
I love him already.
Sweet baby boy
congratulations! cute little dog
Did you have to do research about how to raise a dog before splashing on one? I want one in the future but I have a very busy lifestyle and I'm not sure if I'm eligible.
Congrats, now stop driving with a dog on your lap.

Congrats on yours, he is adorable

Hi Gus, I‚Äôm Gus

  Beautiful Puppy!
Ah yees Gus is the correct name for that dog, perfect.
Is it bad that once I finally get to own my own dog I want to name him Dog?
Awesomeness I'm really happy you shared Gus on reddit üòÅ
Hi Gus :3
Gus is the best name. I had a cat named Asparagus, but we called him Gus.
Well he's fuckin adorable!!
:D
\- "Guess what my dog's name is?" 

"Harry"

\- "Gus"

"I just guessed Harry"

\- "No, Gus"
Air up your tires.
That face just screams: PET ME!
In my house he would be Gus Gus by the end of day 1.
Happy Fellow!

Give Mr Gus a hug for me :)
Hi Gus

Congrats! One day it'll be me!
That puppy is adorable, and looks like he LOVES to drive the car!
Hi Gus!
He looks so happy
What breed of dog is he supposed to be?
Are you prepared for the amount of fun you're going to have?  Also be prepared to talk poop with strangers on the street, you'll be analysing dog poop.  When you return home after walking Gus, you or your  wife will ask how was his poop?  Believe me, it will happen.
OH GusGus! Please give him a small tee shirt!!!
As look at that smile!
Hello gus
He looks like a gus
The markings on his chest look like another doggy silhouette. Love his smile! Congratulations!
‚ÄúI know, you know, they ain‚Äôt tellin‚Äô the truth‚Äù
Happi boi
Congrats on the pup OP, sorry Reddit had a seizure over your picture.

Don't crawl his ears too much until he's older. Sweet buddy nonetheless.
Just make sure he isn't running a restaurant and laundering drug money
Damn, I‚Äôve never seen a dog so happy
Congratulations! On the house and Gus!

Landlords:

He looks so happy. What a cutie!
Baby Gus is awesome. Congratulations on your new family member!
Imagine driving home with a newborn sitting in your lap?
He's adorable. I'm happy for all of you. <3

Hi Gus!!

Is that Mark Wahlberg?
Gus looks so happy!  Congratulations.
Hi Gus!!
I want to hoop his nose! So cute, congrats!

a cutie pie ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
He‚Äôs gonna EAT YOUR TOES.
What a happy boy! Worth waiting for.
HE IS SOOOO ADORABLE
So happy for you !
If you live in a place that doesn‚Äôt allow animals or certain breed of animals you are not allowed to have DON‚ÄôT GET THAT PET. The landlord will find out, they will charge you for it. They will also only give you two options to either get rid of the pet or break your lease.

This is how so many pets end up in the pound and have to be put down. Don‚Äôt get pets you are not suppose to have. You will ultimately cause the pet a lot of suffering because of your willful disregard of the rules.
GUS IS THE BEST CAN I PET GUS?
Proper name too.  Congrats.
What a happy boy! Congrats! Dogs make life so much better.
That car is now the designated Gus Bus.
Black don‚Äôt know anything, Martin"
One day 66, one day
Hi Gus Gus!!! So sweet!
Nice name. Nice doggo
So, how'r ya now?
I would die for Gus
Gus looks thrilled, but the dude looks like he was just diagnosed with herpes.
Is his name a reference to tv show Phych? 

Nevertheless, awesome looking doggy. He looks super happy!
What a cutie!
We all love gus, best puppo
Dogs are the best.
Nice Honda. I'm sure it gives you the reliability, and comfort.
While still being affordable, and rugged enough to take anything you can throw at it, with room for you, and tour growing family!
Those ears are a sure sign of a sweet goofy happy\~go\~lucky doggo!

That loving smile doesn't hurt either!!!

Congratulations!!!
You have the upmost focus haha is crash in a heart beat looking at him
Oh for crying out loud that dog is criminally too cute. Look at those ears! That smile!
Hello, Gus.
Don't drive with a young dog on your lap...
Howdy gus
He is simply gorjysssssss!
GUS!!! üçª
What breed is that?
A lot of these comments are from the same people who will call into shows if there's a swear word. 


Don't have the dog on your lap. If you're driving over 5mph, consider putting a seatbelt on your dog and if you're dog gets big boy and you think at any point you may be in a severe crash, say, a long distance / highway drive, yes you should probably get a dog crate.


But you don't owe these people nothing. They're talking so weird..


You'd think dogs would be extinct by now and the world didn't exist pre internet. So bizarre these lot who frequent r/aww
Gus looks sooooo happy as you guys will be having a dog!! Sooooo excited for you and your wife, and Gus too!!

Congrats on your new cute fur-kiddo!
That‚Äôs the name of my dog :)
you are good people, and that is an adorable pup. congratulations on your new life!
Congrats!  He‚Äôs a super cutie!


We are in same situation. No pets on lease. And now my 5 yo is isolated. We were already talking about getting a pup for the family in the before times.
You really look like TheDetailGeek from youtube!
Just do what I do, skip the dog and go for a kid. They're cuter anyways.
Should've named him Reddit
My man resisted the urge of the cuteness and drove safely.
Man's best friend looks excited!
I fucking love pits! I‚Äôm not allowed to get one in my new apartment so I‚Äôm getting an Aussie Husky mix for my first dog in my new place. Congrats on your puppy!
What a total cutie!!
I love how our rental went from no pets, to a hedgehog, to a hedgehog, and two cats (they only know about the one)
Don‚Äôt drive with a dog in your lap... this seems like common sense.
Gus Gus oh mighty Gus, king of all the playground. Gus Gus oh shiny Gus ,we're glad such a great king we found!
I love Gus already
Looks like he's as excited as you are. Congratulations!
Yo Gus, nice to meet cha!

Whats up, new kid!
You‚Äôre a good boy, Gus.
Hi Gus!‚ù§Ô∏è
Gus looks annoyed to have a dog in his lap while he‚Äôs trying to drive. 

What‚Äôs the dog‚Äôs name, BTW?
Awww he is so adorable üòç
He looks goofy. I like him.
I love his floppy ear, may it never lose it's floppiness!
Gets new dog.

Uses dog as second airbag.

Profit.
Very handsome
And he was a good boy too
Awe! I have a Gus Gus! 

*actually he is Gustav Gustavovich Mont Pilliere Jean Gerard Lemmewinks La Champagne 

 But usually he just responds to Gus Gus

But congrats on your new woofer!
SUCH A HAM! I love Gus!!!
Hello gus
Congrats!
Looks like you've got yourself a patterdale terrier (at least a mix). They're stubborn but if you are consistent with training then they eventually become very obedient. High prey drive though - they will chase rodents and birds and when this happens their ears basically turn off.
YAAAAAAAASSSSS GUS!!! GUS IS A GOOD BOI!!!
U look like the main guy from prison break
Gus is my favorite dog name. I will always call every dog gus, until corrected by it‚Äôs human.
Hi guuusss üòçüòçüòçüòç
Get him registered online as an emotional support animal for $70 and those apartments can‚Äôt say shit. Did it with my German Shepherd.
I dont want to make to much of a fuss but i love guss!
This is me in approximately 4 weeks when my gf and I collect our little pupper üòçüê∂
Very nice! Congrats to you both!

Gus wants you to get you Check Engine light taken care of... üòâ
Hi Gus!
Shouldn‚Äôt have his leash on in the car like that he could choke. But other than that hey Gus!
hello gus i love you very much
 I would die for Gus
He is ADORABLE. I have the opposite issue, I live in an apartment where I can have my cat, but now I have to find a nice place that also accepts cats, which can be hard :(
Finally freedom restored.
He's such a sweet little soul
Gus!
Couldn't have picked a better name! He looks like a Gus!
Gus!
Keep us updated.

Great story. Thanks for sharing.

Scrolling through reddit and I recognized the face. Congrats on the new pup!
Gus: "Hurry home human. I need to sniff all over and pee so badly....never mind!"
I would die for Gus. Just look at that smile
Gus, meet the airbag.

(Hopefully not, but fuck man.)
Hello there Gus üëã I'm so happy glad the owner is with you Don't you üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Gus is the person with the dog on his lap
He is so lovely))) I also love animals, but I live in apartment and I have 2 cats so I can't get a dog. But later perhaps I'll live in a house anad I'll be able to get a dog. Dogs are our friends and I think everyone should has a dog or at least a cat)
Those are some tight shorts, girlfriend!
LOOK AT THE HAPPY BOY OH MY GOSH
Sup
Bruh... get the dog but don't tell the apartment lol
Hello Gus.

GUS. IS. BEAUTIFUL
I almost have the same pic with my girl Nebula
AKA Ghee Buttersnaps
My first dog was named Gus!
Cutie!
Does anyone know what breed this puppo is? A mutt maybe? I think I see some pit in there.
Always have a blanket down whenever you get a puppy. Those cute bastards love to pee
Gus wants you to wear your seatbelt when driving because you are now the center of his universe and he wouldn't understand if you didn't make it home one day.  He's a handsome pup!
Gotta zig before you can zag.  I did the same when I finally was able to settle down and by my first house, congrats!!!!
Hello Gus! Enjoy your new home and keep smiling, you're adorable.
If that airbag goes off...
Oh my he's such a pretty puppy. Who's a pretty puppy?
My husband and I rented huge beautiful apartments but they never allowed dogs , our apartments were huge but we made the decision to buy a house just so we could have dogs, cost us loads, it a shit house, it‚Äôs tiny but has a garden and it‚Äôs ours, we now have 2 German Shepherds and a big goofy cross Rottweiler/ Belgium Malinois, never been happier:)
That earüëç
That smile :D
As someone named Gus I feel FUCKING HONORED LOOK AT THER BEAUTIFUL LITTLE FACE
Gus, you are a lucky boy!
Gus fring!
I LOVE GUS!!!!
Gus is a great doggo
I think you ment a good boi
Congratz on your 1st son, so cute :D
Out of love for Gus Do not get in the habit of traveling with him like that. That airbag go puff and Gus will be no more. üò¨
He's so sweet! Congrats!
Gus is the thirty second most popular dog name. You know the 90th, most popular dog name? Oreo
Gee Buttersnaps! Awwww!!!
That dog will die flying trough a window, get his neck  broken by the leash or crush by the air cushion, the second someone crash into you.  It's alright to have trust in your own driving skills but you should never trust others around you. I see you're wearing a seat belt for your own safety, the same standard of safety should apply to your pet as well.

Secure your dog in your car. Hundreds of thousands die each year from car accident. That's your first parenting lesson.

Oh and, 
Congrats on your new dog.

https://www.petprosupplyco.com/pages/car-accident-pet-statistics-america
I am really sleepy right now, and you pretty much guaranteed me good dreams.
Bro you look 18
Be nice to the carpet in your new home, Gus!
Gus Gus Gus!!!  Have fun in your new home buddy
Actually went "AWWWW!!!!!!" when I saw the pic. How adorable!!!
That dog is adorable.
Gus really, really likes Hondas.
Breed?
I'm currently in that waiting period with my SO- can't wait to recreate this photo ourselves when we move!
Every time I hear the name ‚ÄúGus‚Äù, I think of the fatass mouse from Cinderella named Gus Gus. That‚Äôs all I have to say.
AAACK SO PRECIOUS
Get pet Insurance ASAP
He looks so happy!
If you could leave him off of your lap while you drive, *that‚Äôd be great*.
GUS LOOKS SO AWESOME I NEED A GUS IN MY LIFE HE IS SO CUTE
ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫hi gusüëãüèΩüëãüèΩ

Did you adopt him?
Hi Gus congratulations to you your wife and your new addition
Hi gus!! You‚Äôre a cutie pie
Hi Gus!
Well, for me, living in our own house isn't that good either. Mom doesn't let Dad get us a dog.
Aww Gus is just the cutest little dog I‚Äôve seen today
What breed?
Oh my dog, he‚Äôs adorable.
He looks like a Gus!
Gustor?
I loooooooove his "furrever home" smile
Omg, that is one cute boy‚ù§
Congratulations!
What will happen if your move again? You'll have to buy a house!
Lol gus gus
Aw so cute
Hi Gus!!
So happy for you. It dosen't feel like " home" to me without a dog.
He‚Äôs adorable
I hope Gus is short for Colonel Angus. Or Gus Chiggins.
Why did I think his name was reddit when I first read this?
hey gus, tell your dad  to drive safe, not with you in his lap.  having diarrhea or puking on his lap while he as at afull stop  will get his attention.
Congratulations! For my whole 18 years of life my family was in the same boat, always renting places with a no pet policy. But we finally found a pet friendly apartment last year.. Six days ago we adopted our sweetest boy Fozzie the puggle. So glad to see you found your furbaby too!
GUS is a good boy
Is he named after Gustavo Fring?
You look good in tight little shorts and shirt btw.

Gus is so cute!!!
Hey Gus!
Hody shirb Ibcat you named your dog Reddit
Hello Gus! I would die for you
Such a cute and happy pooch! Awesome!
We got thrown out of our apartment for having a dog since people in other apartments kept knocking on the door so the dog kept barking
HOWDY GUS!!!!!!!!!!!
Just because you can doesn't mean you should
That is one of the most cartoonishly cute puppies I have ever seen. Excellent photo

The joy in his eyes is incredible, he already knows he‚Äôs in a loving family that will take care of him. Plus he‚Äôs pretty damn photogenic
lets hope he doesnt turn into a chicken seller latino terminator
Hope he was a rescue!
Jesus Christ, I am super jelly. Been wanting to get a dog for a while, but I don‚Äôt know if how‚Äôs the right time for us (fianc√©e and me). 

All the best!
Good name.
Congratulations üéâ hi Gus!

GRATZ. Im in the same boat. About to move and get a cat. Meow :)
Congrats! He looks so happy and excited to be with you all.
All you have to do anywhere is register your dog as a service animal and they have to allow the dog in.  You can sue.  Oh also they have to wave the pet deposit as well.
Aww! Welcome home Gus! I cannot wait till my husband and I move to our own home so we can adopt our own cute guy like Gus!!
Gus you beautiful baby
Bitches be trippin'
Talkin' bout my smile
They don't understand
This good boy's style

Gus welcome to Reddit! You are welcome to come by anytime.
Tell Gus I love him.

Hi gus!
Thanks, I like Gus
I thought it was deep-fried lizards.
congratulations! Look at this sweet face! ‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèª
Correction the dog got you. Oh he has you alright, he owns you.
It is literally the best thing ever. Moved into my townhouse with my wife and brought my dog with that I had prior to us getting married, had an ok yard, food enough for my boxer. Townhouse yard sucked, no room for him to run. Last year we bought a house with over an acre of space, he had so much room we got him a playmate. Now we have 2 puppers ruling the roost
He looks mighty happy!!
Hi Gus!!!üíû
Hi Gus
He‚Äôs a good boy, AND a nice boy.
Well happy days, you do know all you need is a doctor script that your dog is a companion animal for your health and no place can ever refuse you. You don't even need to get him registered as such just the doctor writing it up as a prescription is good enough.
oh I wanna be friends with him.  he looks like suchaboi!
Congrats guys you will see, they are a medicine on there own.
Sweet CR-V
OMG üòç
He‚Äôs hella ugly
Hello puppers
Congratulations!!  Gus is adorable!! ‚ù§
Gus! I love you!!
Hey Gus. You're a good boy and I love you.
Congratulations on the acquirement of two new humans Gus.
Gus is absolutely thrilled and I'm happy to see that. Spread the joy, pupper!
Aw love him!
Aww
Gus looks depressed.  Are you guys open to psychotropic medication?
Question:

What awesome type of pup is Gus?
 
Is Gus going to ever have pups? 

And I'll send you all the duck pics you want if I can find a pup like Gus!
‚ÄúHELLO HOOMAN‚Äù
He adorable
‚ô•Ô∏è
AWE!
r/13or30 lol
Best decision you‚Äôve ever made!
Gus is always such a jovially content name. I anticipate home getting swole and even more adorable.
Gus is happy you finally moved. Gus is happy you are his hoomans. Gus is happy because...
Never really was a dog person but this lil guy got me hooked. Cute ass lil mofo. What type of dog is it anyone know?
More like Gus bus.
Gus looks so sweet
Ahhhhhhh hi Gus
Holy cow, man. Have you not heard of ESAs? Are you outside the USA?
Gus looks like a skinny little twerp, the puppy in his lap in frickin adorable though!
Hi Gus
Sup, Gus?!
Gus is a bus
I hope that left ear never stands up straight.
Oh my goodness he looks like a delightful, what rehoming shelter did you get him from?
We're dog name brothers.
GUS 2020.
I don't usually comment on puppy posts about how cute they are.

But damn. He cute.
Hi Gus, from Gus.
Such a cutie!  Congrats, dogs are the best!
I really did not expect those kids to be able to transform convincingly, I thought they'd still end up looking odd or awkward. Nope, those are fantastic costumes
Fresh accord bruh
Awwww GusGus.
You look like you were in middle school six years ago
Oww omg. Congrats!! Gus looks adorable.
Amazing!
Your husband doesn't look very happy
Hi Gus üòÅ
The look of admiration.
Dont have his last name be Johnson or reddit will forever hate him. Secure you dog while driving just as you would a child
HDKSHFJJRHWKFH HI GUS
Cute dog! I see that your tpms light is on, too....the only thing I hate about my CR-V is that damn light. Tire pressure is spot on and the light always comes back on. PITA
So cute
Handsome pupper boi. Congrats.
Happy boy! He loves the Daddy.
Bruh he‚Äôs so cute
Awesome
Truly an amazing feeling! Good for you!
 Congratulations
Gus! /r/HalfFlops?
Awe
HONDA!
Gus? Gus Bus!
ADORBS! Congrats! ‚ù§Ô∏èüêæüêæ
So cute, hi there, Gus
Aw he looks so happy!!
It's amazing when you can finally get a pet! I just recently bought a house and moved in - a week later I adopted two beautiful kittens. It's been wonderful, even with all the scratches!
That‚Äôs what I hate the most about renting. Not being able to get whatever pet you want. Congrats on Gus!
Dude you were so oppressed
So cute!
I misread your period for a comma. For a solid 10 seconds I thought you named your dog Reddit and was impressed.

Do tell Gus that he looks like the goodest boy!
What's the obsession with "no pets allowed" rentals? I can understand no dogs or birds because of nose, but why the broad ban? Cats, rabbits and ferrets are quiet.
Gus is very happy to be with y‚Äôall! Yay Gus Gus!
One day I shall achieve this feeling. Hi, Gus!
Congratulations!!! " And they all lived happily ever after." üíñüíñ
Can he sing star shopping
Now you should get one more, name it Walter & then just sit back and have fun.
I am really glad for you. He looks like the best boy.
Hi Gus, you cute baby!!!
When we first got my beagle from his former owner, we put him in a crate on the back seat. The little turd pooped in the crate the moment the car moved. He‚Äôs super cute but that was stinky.
Nice airbags
Fuck. Now I want another dog.
Omfg he's cute
Perfect match. Your life is going to be so much better. That bond is priceless. Makes you a better human.
Im gonna do it pretty soon!!!
Hey cute dog man! Do you know what the breed is by any chance?
He is perfect! Congrats!
first mistake. not having gus in a travel cage. get in an accident Gus is part of your rib cage.
There is anger in that man's jaw.
Youve been with your wife for 6 years now ? 
But... You look so young ! How old are you ?
Bruh this broke boy couldn‚Äôt afford a house for six years , that‚Äôs sad
He looks very polite
What it do Gus?!
He looks so happy
It's enough to make a grown man cry...
You look eerily like my cousin I haven't spoken to in years...
Hello Gus
I‚Äôm so excited for you. Love him forever
Gus reminds me of that (I don‚Äôt know what kind of animal it is?) in lilo and stitch.
I'm sure this has probably been said a million times but...DO NOT drive with pets in your lap! Your beloved pet will be a pancake if the airbag deploys in an accident. Plus, many morons will focus on the animal and not their driving.
I love dogs but they are so high maintenance! Can't leave the house for more than a few hours!
Hi Gus
He‚Äôs been waiting for you!
Sup Gus
Hey Gus !!!
Guss fring from los polos harmanos.
Look at his happy little face!
Why does the guy look like Channing Tatum from his side profile

This dog is so happy you waited.

Hi Gus ! Who's a good boy?
Hope he bring you both happiness
He's so happy to have parents. Good boy.
I actually read the title bit wrong. I read it "**After 6 years of living in apartments i don‚Äôt accept animals, my wife and I finally moved and were able to get a dog.** "
Hi Gus. I would die for you
