I love when animals are so gentle with babies. That shit melts my heart
Our catdog doesn’t like to be touched, but will go to bed with kiddo every night. Curls up next to him at story time and sleeps half the night in kiddo’s bed. Every night, religiously. Then comes to our bed. I wake up to a cat butt.
Did your brovaries just explode watching this cuteness? Mine did.
Imma go have a baby now so my salty kitty can do that. Hopefully.
I love when animals sense it’s a kid so they’re kinder to them than they are to you. My dogs do gentle with kids but with me is a different story 😂
No one, not even salty cats can resist babies
I wonder if cats find human infants cute like we find kittens.
Fun fact, babies have a grasping reflex that’s present from birth and disappears by 6 months after birth.

Edit: even the toes have the same grasping reflex 😊
That’s cutee
CATagorically precious!

If only our cat was like this. Our's attacks the kids even if they pet her correctly. Distrust with children has now been the normal in my house. Of course she goes mad foaming crazy when she sees any other animal be it dog TEN TIMES her size or another cat.
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THIS IS SO CUTE I'M GONNA DIE
hate to be that guy but this is reversed...
So cute and adorable!❤️
That cute little hand and paw!!
"Here child, take my fecal-germ-covered paw, may it boost your immune system"
I was watching in fear thinking what my cat would do, but this is great
What a smart and compassionate cat! 😻
And that's how catbox germs get into babies.
Oh... OMG..
You are worthy of sharing the title of “baby” with me, human.
The caption makes it so much better
Caption is 100% perfect
The purest and selfless bonds are always shared with animals.
This is precious. So gentle.
...provisionally. Do not make me shun you.
holy toxoplasmosis batman
Awww cute overload
They’re bonding hehe
This makes my heart pitter patter
Good kitteh
Awww this is too cute 😍😍
Oh my gawd 😍
This post has got me feline good
awww 🥰  it's like when spock told kirk "this simple feeling, is beyond v'ger's comprehension."
So precious!
And a great new friendship was born...
Awww! So cuuuuttteee! 🥰 🥰 🥰
"I think I may like this thing."
Cats like “fine, I don’t know why you always gotta hold or suck on shit but here.” *extends paw*
This is pawsome!
This is the power of love and affection. Love does not need the language to communicate, its a heart to heart connection.
❤❤
😍😍
So incredibly precious 🥰
Even as big human I like to hold a cat's paw.
So pure
Aw.... sweet kitty....
Hey, I also wanna hold the paw!
my cat never allow me to hold his hand. once i did, he will take his hand out and press my hand down...
You belong to me, now little hooman.
What an excellent babysitter!
❤️❤️❤️
Awe so, so cute!💯😇
We’ve come many years on the internet and yet the king remains to be the Cat Video
This is the first one of these aww videos that made me actually aww in a long time. I actually did that high pitched squealy aww.
so cute, just look at how animals are friendly with an innocent baby humans. :)
Cats are in luv with babies if those are gentle with them and they also smell of milk.
My mustachio (rip) would love being near my nephew when he was a baby sleeping. Mustache was fucking massive next to my nephew, albeit, he was a little guy.
Such a precious moment
Very beautiful🤩🤩🤩
Animals are smrt
Cute
I typically don’t like babies, but this is really cute
Adorable.We all need this kind of love.
Awww so sweeeeet
Ugh why did I open reddit! It’s 3:41am and I just want watch this all night. The absolute sweetest thing I’ve seen all day :)
So cute
The greatest honor a cat may bestow. Smol human you are now one of the pack.
AWWWWW
Be still my heart!
🥺🥺🥺
We had a cat, the grumpiest most short-tempered cat you would ever meet. Not only were the neighborhood cats terrified of him, but a few dogs were too. I wish I was exaggerating, it was months after he died that the first cat dared to step into our back garden. What's more, he lived to 21. He would let us stroke him for a few seconds at best before he'd beat your hand away. To be fair he didn't really bite and scratch much but was very standoffish even with humans. However, when we were children we could get away with almost anything with him, he'd even let us pretend to ride him and pull at his ears when we were very young. As soon as we turned adults that tolerance was over. It always reminds me how intelligent animals can be to recognize the young of other species. I miss that angry cat.
Look at that chubby little hand.
Cats are the best 💯. Agree?
That kitty love hit different 😍 I remember when my cat Yung Jacob got neutered and was still sleepy from the anesthetics, she just layed in my lap purring. Yes, I named my female cat Yung Jacob she played rough with me but if my sister or mom picked her up she never bit them or scratched them like she did me. We had our moments usually when she was sleeping where she wouldn't fuss about me holding her and she grew to enjoy being held like a baby but she was my sparring partner she knew I loved her enough to provide her with one. Cats are the best, I don't hate dogs but cats chill with you making them the better of the two in my opinion.
awww sweet
Oh my goodness, hold my life in those paws❤️
Nice
My heart. Oh god.
Both of my cats still run in fear of my baby... I long for the day that they accept him
Nice
So cute!
Jeez. My cats were too scared to approach my daughter when she was that young. One of them just got comfortable enough to be petted by her. She’s 8.

The other two cats were fine with her once she grew out of her baby flailing stage.
That is actual love
r/holdmypaw
“He’s so tiny, I’ll show some sympathy”
This is so awesome!
Wubby fingers
My brother's cat is not at all snuggly but she loves the kids and puts up with things from them that she would never accept from others (although they did a good job teaching the kids to let her be if she walks away and I'm sure that helps).
You know this cat is thinking “if this kid tells anyone I did this...”
So precious
That baby is the chosen one!
And that when they became best friends

"Touch me belly though and ill gnaw your fucking arm off"
Obligatory "gross" comment.

I have a baby and the idea of him holding a cat's paw kind of turns my stomach. Cats walk around in their litter boxes stepping on their droppings all the time. Since my son can't go 2 seconds without shoving his fingers in his mouth I'm gonna just say yeah, no kitty touching.

Edit: some of you are way too stupid. Some pet-carried bacteria, fungi, and parasites are incredibly dangerous to babies who have undeveloped immune systems. Taking basic precautions with your baby seems pretty reasonable to me, but apparently I offended people's cats and therefore I'm an asshole or something.
“Yes little one, you will grow up to give me all the treats I desire”- probably cat.
I read this In nibblers voice
I can’t believe this baby is already strong enough to hold a camera
This is the most obvious "kiss my ring" move I have ever seen. Shameless really.
You'll become a fune slave one day, here hold and kiss my paws.
AAA this is so cute
My cat would never
Bagheera, is that you??
*vice grip tightens*
Wao
Why is the baby wearing a gopro?
Круто
Senko-San, the helpful cat
If I make friends with him now, he'll grow up to do everything for me
: Cat.
My cat could never
Hooman*
Awwwwww pspspspsps
Cats are actually pretty good with babies, in my experience.

Except for that Shere Khan motherfucker. What an asshole.
Actually the baby looks biggers u see his or her hand the hand is lagger than the cat head
when he yells "thank you" 🥺
Oh
Isn't that Battleship?
Cats are tsunderes
That's lovely. Our cats stay far away from our baby. She is pretty rough with them though when she gets a hold of them...
It's not a pawn it's a little hand.
Russian blues are super maternal
The baby is the cat's pet
😂😂
What breed is this cat? Is it a British Shorthair or a Russian Blue?
WAIT. WHYS THERE A BABY ON YOUR CAT?!
I love old stuff like this is Spielberg
I seem to recall hanging out with some babies as a kid and they would always grab your finger if you put it in their palm... aww, now I miss that. And I hate kids and babies now too. Maybe I'm just to cynical to even look them in the face.
This could be my house because I have the exact same cat, baby and couch. Except the baby is 13 now. And the cat wasn't around then. Come to think of it, my couch is red.
THIS IS VERY ADORABLE I APPRECIATE YOU FOR POSTING THIS
How gently this cat puts his paw on the baby is just too adorable.
Awwww😭
The best thing here is the "human" in the title instead of "hooman"
„This is a one-time thing and if you tell anyone I will scratch your face.““
Did they just become best friends?!
Here, take my paw. . . it is full of knives.
It's beautifil. 

I've looked at this for five houres now.
“Be calm, my tiny human”
I absolutely love watching babies interact with pets. I think my biological clock is ticking, and I'm a 29 year old man.
More like tiny servant
It always amazes me how animals are tolerant toward baby humans like human babies trigger their parental instincts
A baby petting a fuzzy baby, im in love
Aww my stars! well if this just didn’t melt my heart! 

As for how nice the cat is being to the baby, well when cats meow at humans it is the same frequency as a kitten and a human baby’s cry which is why it’s hard to ignore a sweet cat meowing at you. Your biological clock pulls on your heart strings and makes you want to love it. I suppose in turn it works with the baby, the cat recognises the sound as being similar to a kittens.
Tsundere Cat
That child sneezes it is getting shredded
And iirc cats hate being touched at their feet
Internet police here, looks reversed.
Is it just me, or someone elas also read the title in Dwight's voice and mannerism?
Aww that cat should get a million bucks.
Our cat is a massive softie. Curls up on my lap every night to watch Netflix, comes to find me if I’m working upstairs or greets me when I come home.

He hates my nearly 3 year old boy. Not in an aggressive way, just flat out avoids him and runs if he can hear him. At this point it would be reasonable for my son not to realise he even shares the house with a cat.
Sorry to be a Debbie downer.. isn’t this reversed though?!
My animals are gentle but generally want nothing to do with the baby whatsoever. 

One cat won't stay in the same room unless she's well out of reach and it's quiet enough to sleep. The other will observe, has occasionally tried bunting, but generally keeps his distance, and nopes the fuck out if a baby hand comes toward him

The dog sees the baby as attention competition, though occasionally likes licking the baby. None of them every try to cuddle with the baby.
A connection  made for life
This is freaking cute and adorable 🤗😍😙😁😎.
BIG AWWWWWWWW IRLLL SO CUTEEEE T_T
Awe it's so cute I had a cat like that but it passed last year
Seriously tho...that look of contentment from the cat when the baby grabs hold of it's paw... awwwww

Edit...or was the cat just slowing down the bumps to the face ?...I'm sticking with my first thought...I'll sleep better
Haha “sigh” makes this comment. 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
Awww, that looks like my Sinda. 15 years old, 17 pounds, an absolute tank and gentle as hell.
M....e.....l.....t.....e......d.....!!!!
kitty wub
The baby has been chosennnnn
This is too cute... 🥺
my cat "bolt" also doing this.thats extra cute❤❤
Wow they act almost like hornets.  That's crazy.
"in the future, i may need something..."
That's a Russian Blue cat right? The kitty is so loving to it's tiny human 😍 😍♥️💗. This makes me miss having cats so bad!
This is gross. I hope they washed the babies hands. Nothing like litterbox paws all over a new babies hands...
Awww!! 😍
I'm pretty sure the hormones for animal with baby humans can be just as strong as for their own, because the number of cats I've met that see a pregnant woman and want to be around them 100% of the time can't be a fluke.
The kid got a great story to tell when grown up
Um... Dont let then alone.
that baby did a great job taking a video of that
I think this is the purest thing I've ever seen on here.
I've heard that cats consider humans like a big bumbling kitten that just looks different. That's why they bring you dead animals, to teach their kitten how to hunt. That's also why they attack you, there trying to teach you how to fight. The cat is also probably being gentle with the baby because it recognizes it's really young. Dogs are different and consider us like we consider them, a best friend.
My cat loves "holding hands" with me.  She also likes me to cup my hand so she can fall asleep in it.  So sweet!
Is this in reverse?
What the cuteness is this!
e were TDad w weed was swere da thy sw de f.sd fttrdEesra
Awww I love it!
Thank you so much for sharing this! One of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen! 💕
Gotta say - I don’t really like cats. But omg that’s freaking cute. Also caption = perfection.
omg so cute
Id never trust a cat with a young baby like that. They have a hunter instinct, even if they are gentle they can destroy a bird or a small mammel. Even if they dont intend any harm, they could be "playing" according to their nature. 

A scratch from an animal without any vaccines or immune system could lead to complicated infections.
Posts like this make me want a baby again 😭
/u/gifreversingbot
This was played in reverse. Cat didn't give paw, cat pulled paw away.
The Baby now has a stand: r/FakeSubReddit
Indeed.  If you reverse any video of pulling away and you have d'aww.
Nah baby punched him alittle and kitty was like, "what was that bud, we got a problem?". 😅🤣
The cats just sad the “tiny human” isn’t edible.
Gotta love little fat baby hands.
Did the cat eventually tip the child off the sofa?
And another human that gets infected with toxoplasmosis. Gross animals, cats are..
This scares me.  All it would take is a pull of the ears or something to startle the cat and your beautiful baby is scarred for life.  Now these parents have a disfigured baby and the cat is in the shelter waiting to be euthanized.   Cute video but also disturbing due to the lack of responsibility.

Dude, the baby already knows how to use a camera!
Ok but is the person filming this putting the phone right in the baby's face
