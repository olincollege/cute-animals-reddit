Look what I made! Are you proud of me?
Wow check out the whiskers on that cat!
This is beyond adorable. Congrats to you and your kitty.
Wow that's a long lasting black ink printer, btw congratulations to you and your adorable and your adorable's adorable.
Congrats, cute cat fam!!! She looks hella pleased.
This looks just like my kitty that I'm getting spayed next week.

Damn this is emotionally taxing.
So much sweetness packed into one photo. 🥰😻😸
give her lots of pets!
I wonder if animals realize that they are pregnant, or do they just begin giving birth and are like WTF IS HAPPENING
Me petting my cat (she is a good mother)
Your cat is extremely cute and I'm sure the kittens are adorable but after this please get her spayed. It's better for her health and there are just way too many kitties in the world that are neglected and that need homes.
[removed]
You getting all of them fixed? And the mom too?
Please spay your cat. Enough kittens are entering shelters and never coming back out as it is. There is no excuse to add even more.
heheee so cute

Sweetie
And she should be.. what a beautiful family ❤

I thought it was cow's poop
Proud mom or confused dad
(Serious question) — are people not spaying/neutering their pets...?
I remember when my mom's cat had kittens. Great memories :D
[removed]
Awesome, glad the babies and mama are ok! Now please get her fixed. The world doesn’t need more cats.

Even if those are barn cats, they will continue to breed. The only reason why barns aren’t overrun by cats is that they mostly die super young.

Even if they all have homes waiting for them, those are spots that could have gone to shelter cats, of which thousands are euthanized each week.

Sorry to sound alarmist but please, please spay and neuter your pets, it’s the right thing to do. This is not cute.
Your cat should be spayed or neutered
Hope you spay/neuter your kitter and the litter.
Great! 

So when did you book her a vet appointment to be spayed?
needs more blankets ☺️
Awesome! Now spay your damn cat.
The whole family is beautiful, but please get her spayed! There are so many unwanted kittens in the world already.
Were is the dad tho
Thats so cute!
That is a very unusual looking bird and hatchlings
spay
When you can please give her towels as bedding. The rough hay isn’t great for tiny kittens.
She looks so sweet!
Congrats. Now get her fixed and get all of them fixed when they’re old enough. What is it for cats? 6 months?
i came to reddit for porn, stayed for the proud mama cat
Look at those little jelly beans!! So cute.
Should the baby’s be on a cat bed or something softer than straw?
And the dad went to buy milk....
She's brave. My cat is also giving birth today.
Adorable, but please spay her after she’s weaned the kittens.
I made dis.
leave it to reddit to shit on a mom cat and her kittens because she wasn’t spayed lmao
Oh my gosh I love her and her babies. Well done sweet girl.
Affectionate, gentle girl. It's good when such a beautiful cat lives at home.
She looks so proud
The kittens. The cat. The cat momma looking up at their human. Human looking at their pet. The feels. Everything. Picture Perfect!
Thanks so much for sharing this beautiful picture with us. Momma cat looks so proud! She knows exactly how and where to take care of her little ones. I enjoy looking at all these wonderful pictures of animals and I truly wish that other people would also enjoy it instead of being so "down" when a truly wonderful thing like this is pictured.
Congratulations on your new deposit :)

Very beautiful kittens and your cat looks like it's in her head: "Yes! I did it!" :)
What a proud mama!

For the "spay your cat!" crowd - consider that this cat may have been adopted while pregnant. It happens.

Please spay your cat. There are millions and millions of kittens born every year for whom there are not enough homes for, spaying your cat is the responsible thing to do. Plus spaying is the only way to prevent pyometra.
No pressure, but I'ma need you to share more. Cats being motherly is the cutest thing ever to me
Its amazing how when you're feeling down, a single picture like this can make you feel better.
Plot twist, her husbands white.
Now will you get it spayed please?
Not gonna lie. I thought those were giant turds at first. But that’s what I get for going on Reddit 5 minutes after waking up and still being groggy
Did she cheat with a bbc? A big black cat? :D
awww congrats to her (and you)!!!!
[deleted]
Good job putting dry hay in the basket, it helps provide warmth
💟
so cute
She is an absolute star, what a beautiful family!
 Congrats!!! What beauties!!
She's so pretty 😍
❤️
This just made my morning, thank you :)
Hey, babe, why are our babies black? Wait, are you having a Meowfair?
she looks cool, its sad that 3 weeks from now she will move on and forget about the kittens
Your cat? 

You keep your cat outside in a straw bed?
Lovely family
So wholesome!
Are you impressed hooman?
[removed]
Hey, can I also have some free karma and chime in with SPaY or nEUTeR YoUr caTs for the millionth time? We get it, children of granola. Congrats on the kittens. Don’t feel guilty for sharing the news.
That's a good cat right there.
Whole thread full of big heroes who can't enjoy the sight of a happy mother cat and some cute kittens without giving their unneeded, unasked, high-minded opinions about feline reproduction.
*Ohhhhh thanks for not forgetting I need some luvin*
[deleted]
This is so incredibly sweet. Thanks for sharing this beautiful moment OP.
Look hooman, I made dis
not every place is over run w stray cats.  Our local pet control program (including the spaying/neutering of feral cat colonies) has been so effective that the shelter rarely has cats or kittens. They end getting delivered cats from a shelter from the next state over and 8 hrs away.  We’re also a pretty rural area and they try keep barn-cats available as well.  Just because op cat had kittens doesn’t mean there is an over population where they live.  A friend the next town over ended up being adopted by a pregnant stray that decided to settle in her yard...and no kitten ever saw the shelter...all got spoken for by neighbors & friends pretty quickly.
You should be proud to be around a wonderful feline family! 🤞❤️
Omg are those black kittens the father cat must have been sleeping with a black cat /s




Reddittors chill out this is a sarcastic reference to the fake news article where a white woman gives birth to a black baby and accuses her husband of cheating


Edit holy fuck why does everytime im being sarcastic end up on me getting downvoted to hell.

These kittens are beautifull it was just a joke

That cat is a race traitor

Gorgeous! She looks very proud of herself

my cat gave birth to three beautiful kittens the day after I had my youngest son, not a peep, no fuss just got on with it, not a midwife in sight (the cat, not me)
I stared at my screen for way longer than I’d like to admit since I thought this was a video
Well done mum, they’re beautiful
little cute kitty what a great mom , keep them safe and healthy
So cute
Cute
Soooooooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My cat tried to play with her newborns almost 5 minutes after they were born.
She is so sweet 🥲
Sweet girl and her freshly made beans🥺♥️
Dude when I saw the preview image I thought you were holding the cat off the ground by the scruff. I had my Torch already lit and my pitchfork sharpened. I'm so glad I had just mistaken it ;-;
I think she's also a big fan of pats :)

The big jellybean made little jellybeans.
Everybody is proud. And she is too.
Congratulations on your new little family :)

I'm sure you'll be happy together)))

And where is the father of these beautiful kittens?)
Animals dont any sense like human.
Give her many pets please
My cat was a proud mom until she abandoned her kittens and then when they grew up, hissed and attacked them every time she saw them.
You’ve been blessed. Protect them with your own life
I don't know why but this brought a tear to my eye
I love cats with white toes. It looks like they have a manicure and are extra fancy.
Awe ao adorable
Is the father cat around
Get those kitties a soft blanket!
Spay your cat there’s enough kittens and cats
Get some blankets straw wouldn't be that comfy or warm for them
Proud momma brings a smile to anyone’s face. Wonderful :)
Mmmmm snack time
She looks so happy!
It is interesting to see the father of these kittens :)

Their mother is a light coloring, and for some reason the kittens are all black coloring :))))
Wheres her babydaddy ? And its un-PC , but considering how all her kittens are apparently black in color ...
Aw, beautiful
When I was a child, I did something with my own hands and came to brag to my mother about what I managed to do with my own hands. I congratulate you on the addition of kittens :)
Are you in the us & interested in adopting the kittens out when they are ready?
Cute

At first i thought she just took a huge dump.
lil bebes
Meeeeooowww
cat - 'at least somebody appreciates my efforts'
This is so cute oh my god
So sweet
Such pretty babies! I wish I had a kitten like that. Unfortunately, my father loved to take them for a "walk in the woods" too much :(
We will always be proud of you and your fuzzy bean children!
Aiiiii❤️🥰❤️
Way to go mama:)
I thought at first it was giant shits the cat took
thats so sweet !! :3
I guess we know the father is black.
Just make sure that she will have a very Great and special Mother's Day treat.
This does not have enough upvotes
Aww man!!! Such a beautiful queen!!!
Ok....I'm tired now.
For a split second, I thought the cat was proud of the massive dump it took
None look like her! Awh I love tabby cats too
On the first pass, I read that as:
My cat is a very proud nom.

I've been brainwashed by internet subculture.
Her white-cat husband, walking in: “Susan what the hell is going on here?!”
Floofy doesn't care about politics, Floofy doesn't care about religion, Floofy cares that head is rubbed and tummy is full.
At first I thought that cat took a massive dump and was feelin herself
AWWHHH suck a cute cat 😍😍
Now take her to an animal rescue Org & have her spayed. And have the kittens spayed/neutered at 8 weeks old.
Black kittens. Where is the daddy cat ?
Goodyear cat
And the babies came out a different colour. Suspicious indeed
awww she looks so cute
Well, you know what they say...she’ll never go back! Just kidding! Beautiful mom and kittens! Thanks for sharing with us!
Momma has reason to be proud
She seems to be wearing fingerless gloves 

(So cute)
Is this an agenda post?
Yeah I to love it when my cat prepares food for me
Always proud, what a nice cat!
Post more pictures !
"Human look what I made!" 
Yeah this is adorable 11/10
Look at those fluffy little nuggets and their sweet mama!
Lol
To bad those kitties wont grow up without a father.
What sweet momma.  Those kittens have a wonderful start to their lives.
Awe, very clearly so!
OMF-bunchofnewwords-G!!! Quit telling the OP to spay the Fing cat! We all understand! Get off your high horse!
Good job, cat mama. ♥️
Insert Bob Barker here.
that is cute i love it
Congratulations Mommy Cat, Welcome to the world baby Cats😊 I love cats, Can I have one please?😍
Who is Dad?
Mom is brilliant!!!
I love this omg I remember having to nurse a little kitten 🥺
These kittens allready look waaaaayy to cute
A warm nest of baby kitties! Mom is so proud!
Aww so Sweet. Cats are the best animals.
Those babies 😻
Black children.. Mom isnt black..... You know what that means!
I thought... I thought it was her massive shit
You can easily tell when a dog is happy. Or sad, or feeling guilty. Cats are harder to read- especially if it’s not yours.

You can always tell they’re proud when they show off their kittens.
 "I'm proud of you!!"
She didn't consent when you locked her in with a strange cat...
Those kittens are black! Who is the father!?!!?
I predict that 40 years from now we will stop spaying and neutering cats, but maybe will use some sort of less invasive birth control. By spaying/neutering we are surgically altering the cat and are taking away some of the joys of its life. No sex? No babies? It’s similar to (but not the same as) surgically declawing/amputating. Scratching is a natural behavior, eliminating it has psychological and physical effects. Same with the reproductive drive and act

I adopted a lovely spayed 5 year old and she treats my kids like her own. She hears them fuss or cry and wanders over to meow at them and distract them by asking them to pet her. What a good girl, but makes me think her maternal instinct is strong and she probably would’ve loved a litter of her own
Thats nothing to be proud of, babies don't just start growing without doing the rudie poos.
The kittens are so cute.
Makes me wanna slit their throats and drink their blood
I have two unfixed cats. One male and one female. 
They are both breeding age and have been in heat. 

They never get pregnant and I don’t know why. The vet always makes it sound like they get pregnant so easy it’s like they look at one another abs BAM.  My cat has had almost a year of being sexually mature and isn’t pregnant.

My male gives up while mating her because she fights him off or he just doesn’t finish.  He wants to do it but it last like a second snd then he just gives up. 

She was like coming into being an adult cat from older kitten when I got him. He was a baby at 8 weeks. They groom each other, sleep together, follow each other, are inseparable but for some reason don’t seem to mate. 
I’m always home and have only heard him successfully mount her for maybe a minute before he got knocked off and just went to eat instead.

She tries to get outside while in heat and yowls desperately but for some reason the two of them just don’t seem to get that they can mate. 

I want kittens and I’m so sad she can’t get it. 
My dad wants one of their kittens very bad and the families they came from want one too because the mother cat was hit by a car and then the dad cat went away according to the vet he probably went off looking for her because she didn’t come back after being hit and taken to the vet and he wandered too far and just never came back.

It’s like they think they’re siblings and I’m like noooooo. :(
Actually if that’s the mom then where is the dad and please state your sources it’s your cats
Omg my little girl is preggo too ❤️
Well boys, looks like we’re having Chinese tonight.
Omg I thought that was my cat for a second. Splitting image
she is actually proud of her creation, just look at her face <3
What a cutie!
That's awesome! What's her name so we can smoke a cigar in her honor!
THOT
If the father is not a black cat... We may get have a problem.
Damn they all black as hell
Awww
No jokes about the absence of the black father yet?
What a lovely Kitty 😍
Such a cutie
And I am a very proud commenter.
[deleted]
I have had one cat that became a mom. We knew she was gonna be a mom and we assigned the kittens to different family members and she wound up with ONE kitten.
Always wanted a cat but can't get one :/
Keep us updated! 🤘
KITTYYYYYYYYYYY
Good job mama :)
so cute
Great news!
She’s a beautiful girl
They don't look Rubbermaid
Only chickens put their young in straw. She’s a chicken now
What a happy mommy…)
“You see this, I made this” *purrrr*
Looking comfy 😍💪
That’s so sweet, I think they all have their father’s coat but their mom’s sweet spirit
Such a sweet photo. Congratulations on the new family members
As if the cute cat had grabbed the nest of the bird it was eating :)

That's so awesome!! My girlfriend's cat just had four healthy kittens as well about 3 weeks ago. Precious😊
I will steal all the little floofballs and the bigger floofball, you cant stop me!
My cat had two kittens last week. Came home from a ten hour shift and she was in the middle of eating the second one.
