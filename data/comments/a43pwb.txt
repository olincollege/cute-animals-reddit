I wish dogs could let us know what they think about. 

One day, this dog was sitting at a shelter. You have to think they know that no one wants them. Dogs are such social animals, and many just want to have some interaction with someone or another dog. 

One day, this family comes along, plucks this dog out of the shelter, and takes him home. The dog doesn’t really know what’s going on, but he goes along with it because he now has his interaction with another being, and it’s going well. 

The dog develops this relationship with the kid. They both have a best friend, a true companion. 

Next thing you know, the kid come into the room dressed as a dragon. The dog has no idea what a going on, but agin, the interaction is positive, so he rolls with it. Next thing you know, the kid is putting the dog  into a matching dragon outfit. And we get this picture to enjoy.

Does the dog enjoy this situation as much as we do? Does he realize he won the dog lottery at the shelter? Does he fear he returns to the life he once lived? Or, does he get to relax because he’s loved beyond more than he will ever know?

The dog will likely leave this earth before the family does. One day, the family will look back at this photo, the moment forever will remain with them. That dog will be missed terribly and he will never know. 
The Dog looks so prepared for whatever the kid is about to do lol. Love it!

Those dinosaur suits are [dangerous!](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/10/menace.html)
That kid is going to grow up and lose this picture, to only refind it a while later and tear up because of the nostalgia.
When I adopted my second I sent in a pic of her first day home. It was after her first bath, asleep in her new bed, all cozy. Sent it in a/her documents that I followed up w/her spaying (required in Ca for rescues). 

Good thing I did, the rescue didn’t remember getting the documents until I mentioned the photos. Then they totally remembered. They loved the photos and then closed my file as I had fulfilled my obligation. 

Yes, still have her, she’s 10 now. Took her a minute to bond with me, but she’s my girl. 
This is how best friends for life are made.

Love how closely doggo is listening to toddler.  "This is how we gets lots of treats and lovies!"
I adopted my dog 5 years ago and just a couple months ago I was cleaning out my email and saw the emails from the rescue I adopted through....so I sent them an update email w some pictures and they were so excited and enthusiastic about it. Made me smile. 
My dog and kid had similar (not as good) costumes this year:

I can say that my kid was infinitely more into it than my dog.
What breed is the dog on the left?
One upvote does not seem enough....

I volunteer at our local shelter, and I don't think people realize what a lift it gives us to see pictures like these. Every now and then we get one, but not nearly enough.
They're going to be besties forever. 
Is there such thing as an adult sized dinosaur costume and a matching basset hound sized dinosaur costume? Asking for me, let's be honest
He's a little Mr Piffles!

Well...a big Mr. Piffles
*open the door*  
*get on the floor*
What a beautiful picture.
Dino and Doggo! It should get it's own series
IDK that T-Rex looks vicious. It looks like the dog is trying to fool the T-Rex so he doesn't get eaten. I'll need more evidence to better assess the situation.
*pupdates
Best. Picture. Ever. 
I hope you asked this family's permission to post this. 
You are my hooman
me too!
/r/thisismylifenow 
That’s not a dog that’s a dinosaur! Oh no!

Fortunately it looks like it got assigned to the right Dino family. Whew!
I just lost my fluff ball to old age today, he was a rescue. This post made me smile, thank you.
Am I the only one who finds it weird that OP is essentially sharing another family's child's photo? Like did you ask for permission to submit this for the imaginary points?

Like I know it's a harmless act, the child is probably going to be staying anonymous. But I feel like this is a breach of privacy, they didn't ask for this to be posted on the internet (only to the shelter), this'll probably spread through a bunch of other websites that just steal shit from reddit, and probably one day the child, or the parent, is going to come across this and find as a violation of trust.

**edit/disclaimer:** I'm not trying to demonize the post, let alone OP, just trying to make people realize their actions might have unintentional consequences. Especially when you're posting someone else's private personal photos.
Does anyone know where I can get these suits? They look so fabulous together. <3 
This is is wrong to dress the dog up.  The dog can choose to be whatever it desires to be, like a potato.
This one should make everyone smile!
Oh my.. this is the most precious thing.
And as a dog trainer who has also been involved in rescue, I'm going to be a wet blanket and say this photo should unnerve you. This child's face is up close to the dog's and he's holding his head, while he's dressed up in a silly costume and likely a bit stressed. The dog doesn't look thrilled, and anytime a kid is in this position up to a dog my heart skips a beat
Good on ya for volunteering at a dog rescue. 

Also dog is decorated beautifully.  
Hahahahahahaha wow that is awesome. I volunteer at a local humane society and love seeing that stuff too
Jurassic Bark.
What breed of dog is that? I had to do a double take because it looks exactly like my dog!
That dog is living his best life.
This is my new favorite picture on the internet
What an incredibly warm story. What a wonderful heartfelt story. Thank you for sharing ❤️
Those guys are gonna be best buds forever. 
I have fostered several senior pugs who had been used for breeding, had their health neglected, and been dumped on the street when the owner was through with them has been one of the most rewarding things I've ever done. I get to help and watch these dogs get healthy, learn to trust, and see their personalities start to shine through. After several months of care, I send them off to their forever homes. And from there I get to watch as they enjoy the rest of their lives with their family. I get pictures and video updates, and from time to time I meet them at the dog park. I love it. Absolutely love it! Dogs are just the freaking best and they deserve every happiness. Thank you for volunteering!
Damn I want one of those for my dog. Even tho he totally freezes up and refuses to Walk and just stand ackward whenever you put any kind of clothing on him 

But damn he would look cute 
Pooch the magic dogon 
How wonderful that this family and this dog found each other! Adopt, don’t shop!
I swear, all dogs are saints 
My first dog was a rescue and she was just the best. She looked at me with such love, like she appreciated me. My second dog was purchased. He looks at me with disdain, like I've already failed to give him whatever it is he believes he is entitled to. I miss my rescue. 
It's nice no one yet has said something stupid like "He's a dog so treat him so and respect him as a dog and not as an human".
Nice to see a dog brought back to a new life! 
What a good dog! It takes a special dog to 1. put up with a costume 2. love a toddler. Lucky family, lucky dog :)

Aww, I love pupdates like these! :D
My dad just had to go into a care home; his memory is shot and he’s totally unsafe. He LOVES dogs. Not many things really bring him joy, but this picture will! I can’t wait to show it to him.
Thanks for all you do!
Real r/aww material right there
This is the most wholesome shit I’ve ever seen
THat looks EXACTLY like my dog, is it a corgi/chihuahua?
absurdly precious.

Aw man, arrow to the heart
This is THE CUTEST THING I'VE SEEN THIS WEEK!! Thank you for posting. 💛💛💛💛
This is the cutest thing ive seen in my life. 
This has got to be one of the best pictures on the internet. Period.
We can just go ahead and shut down the internet.  Nothing will ever top this picture.  Humanity has reached its pinnacle.  
I wish people were more careful with animals around children, especially newly adopted
I'm sure i will get downvoted, but OP I hope you have permission fron that kids parents to post this on the internet... 
omg I need this for my dog. 
It does not get any cuter than this!!
adRAWRable!
r/Blurrypicturesofbabies
This is such a sweet photo and I love seeing happy endings! I hope the owners got some education though. Allowing a small child to put their face in a dog's face is asking for a bite to happen. I'm sure they mean no harm and simply don't know better but the dog is turning its head away which can indicate discomfort.

Doggone Safe is an excellent resource for these adopters to learn to read their dog's body language. A bite to the face can mean major surgery for the child and a death sentance for the dog. A little education can prevent that from happening. www.doggonesafe.com
Made me smile too 😁
I follow my local rescue just for posts like this.
Awww!!! So freaking cute!!! 
That’s a good dino-dog
This is PRECIOUS 😭
DINOSAURS!!!
Never had a post make me smile this much, miss my dog more than ever now, at uni a little bit drunk and feeling the feels if you know what I mean 😭😭😭

Um.. I only see 2 dinos in this pic and no dog?
That is sooo dang precious!!! Makes me 😢 but in a good sense. 
Dinos being bros. 
Anyone have any idea where to buy that costume? 
That’s so sweet!

I can not upvote this enough. 
Where can I get that costume for my beagle?
He’s dressed like Piff like comedigician
Holy forking shirt balls!!!

Don’t think I was ready for this level of adorable 
+/u/sodogetip 100 doge for dinosaur rescue.
What about like 4 year later updates? We took in a little turd, he had been returned twice (probably based on the fact he was so sweet in the shelter, but turned vicious at home) but we got him to get comfortable, and now two sets of stitiches in two different people, he is the sweetest pup ever, he won't dress up, but he's the best little shit. 
Can you ask where they got the Dino costume for the kid?   We need this bad!!!
Where the Wild Things Are
Ya well I'm gonna blow the whistle on this one after today's episode
Is that a beagle? They LOVE LITTLE KIDS so I bet doggo is in heaven. 
how is this not r/mademesmile
Now this puts a smile on my face
This makes me so happy. 
In a way, the rescuers are rescuing you
This is so sweet. 
This is adorable.
Both my rescue border collies were abused in some way. They were so scared the first night, probably feeling that the foster owner abandoned them. My girl dog destroyed the blinds trying to get out. It was so sad. But, the next they had accepted that we were going to love them, and now they are happy collies!
I am a veterinarian for our local humane society, and I love pics like this! Especially when I just remember the dog as a sad, homeless reject.
They should be called pupdates....

We got a dog from the local shelter @ 10 days ago. Driving me crazy, but the family loves her (and I dig her too). We can see the "thank you" in her smile. 
Awww!!! ☺️ that made me tear up a little.
Thog don’t care 
Oh goodness this overwhelms my heart!!!
R/mademesmile
I should get one for my dog!
I want that suit!
*"Rawr! RAWR!!"*
Dino Doggo
This is Alfie, a west highland terrier who we got from a shelter, when we got him he had hardly any fur, his (almost) entire skin was black due to being basically dead due to unknown infections and he would spend the entire day switching between hugging a teddy bear and scratching himself on anything and everything. 2 years later and a good and caring local vet who told us his exact problem, (canine Atopic Dermatitis) for those who are interested. We switched him to raw food to remove any possible allergens, he gets weekly Malaseb baths, and daily snuggles. Also, the shelter told us he was 2, the vet and his groomer (who he loves because she gives him lavender oil massages and hot towel wraps) have both said he is at least 7... shame that the shelter lied to us (and gave us a "no refund" half price discount) but I'm glad we get to enrich and enjoy this old fellows life, he really makes us feel proud and warm and squishy inside...

This is like the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen and now I’m gonna cry 
The things he does for love
I like the dog in the bg that’s become a shadow
This wouldn't happen to be in Michigan would it? My sister adopted a dog that looks just like this one. 
i believe you meant to say "pup-dates"
It makes me laugh,too. How I wish I was a child, too.
Am I the only one that noticed the blurry fur demon behind the child?
This is one of the cutest things I've seen all day!
Beautiful friendship and love 
I rarely say "awwww" out loud,  this was an exception. Super cute.
D'awwww
i didnt know piff the magic dragon had a family
Super adorb
Aww, this doggo looks like my old doggo (AmStaff = American Staffordshire terrier), got him when I was a kiddo, rescue, I dressed him up also, he passed of old and loved age.
Most loving, caring, precious nature and nurture.

Miss you Darbie xo

That's awesome!
This picture wins the internet.  I just love love love it.  What wonderful memories.  😀❤️

I think the dog on the left has something wrong with it
I hope this kid gives us an update in 10 years!
I now have an idea for next year's costume!
Dogs are just magic. Happy for both. This child will be richer for being raised with his favorite pooch.
Awww!
Dogs are so good<3
Anything for you - dog
That looks just like my dog, except Clyde has a light colored nose. Any idea what this dog is? I think mine might be a lab/pit mix. 
Too cute!

That's REAL cutie.  Upvote from me.
Does this person know you posted a photo of their toddler on the internet for millions of people, including a number of predators, to see?
Fuck, I wish my dogs would play with their baby human brother.
I feel like the dog rescue people push just a little too far into my business than I'm comfortable sharing with strangers.  It's like are you trying to get rid of these dogs or case me for a robbery?  I don't know you.
Literally the cutest!! Oh my god!! 
[deleted]
Because dogs love wearing costumes and having a toddler grab their face?
Aren't dogs' instinct to bite when someone is holding their head and coming down on them like that?
Last week a parent took a baby into a local hospital for a pitbull bite. It was a rescue that had passed an aggression test and had no aggression. The mother had to carry the kid's appendages into the hospital.
That’s an amazing Dino costume. I used to wonder why my parents never got me any outfits like that but ...then I realized I would probably refuse to take it off. For days.

that upturned Hot Wheels car is going to make someone’s foot very painful - hope they catch that
Omg the poor dog, the "family" just picked him up as lunch for their pet pooposaurus. 
Adding to the stack of evidence: “Dogs are better than Cats”
Someone on insta posted a video of a dog getting its head crushed by heels through its eyes... How do I report this. It was really disturbing....
Did anyone reply this one made me climax? Cause if they did that is despicable.
