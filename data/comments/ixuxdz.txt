Well, it's not like he can read a shampoo bottle so that's a great alternative
We got our cat a picture of a cat reading the newspaper.  He seemed to appreciate this.

The little canvases are an adorable addition
My cat would tear these down 

Edit: thank you kind person for my very first award!
One of our cats likes to stare at me when he uses the box. He would not appreciate this wall art.
*Scrolling through Reddit*

*Sees my cat on r/aww with 42k upvotes*

"Wait. What."

I don't know who you are u/slingblade1315 but thank you for sharing this with the world xD I was too self conscious to share it myself but it looks like I was holding back from the internet lol

Her name is Luna, she's six months old, and my wife and I rescued her from under a porch where she had malnourishment, anemia, and 50+ fleas on her body. In the course of just five days she was bright eyed and strong, and is literally dopamine on legs. She's our everything <3 The most patient, goofy, loving kitten we could ask for. Glad you all are getting as much fun out of this as we do each day xD

Edit: thanks for the gold, random internet person! :D
What kind of litter is that? Does it not track? I have never seen anyone that has the litter out in the open and no litter pad to catch litter before.
This made me laugh out loud (yes, spelling it out).  Thank you for posting!
Lmao actually a good idea I like this a lot
This makes me want to do this for my cats!
To take his mind off the fact they make him poop in plain sight?
everyone should have something to do while pooping
My cat would pull it off the wall and bury it in his shit box. Anything near his box can potentially end up in the box.
Cats can't focus closer than about a foot in front of them. They can admire the backdrop while they are doing their zen gardening routine after though.

Edit: zen gardening, not seen gardening
Mine don’t have bathroom art but they do have some over their food bowl! It’s a pretty picture I cut out of an art magazine and glued into a cheap frame I had. I want to get some tiny doll house sconces to put on either side (cause why not go all out) but to get 2 of them on amazon that actually light up would cost like $40 and it’s at most a $15 joke.
Did the cat give you permission to snap a picture of it pooping?
I THOUGHT I WAS THE ONLY ONE TO DO THIS. omg. I painted cat pin ups.
I love this!!!!!
That’s purrrfectly pawesome.
The Loorve Museum
Is her litter box in the living room?
y’all don’t?
Please don’t show this to my cats - then they’ll want an cat art wall too!
Does she have newspapers too?
Okay, now I seriously want to do this for my kitty :P lol
I have far too much time on my hands and two kittens who will *definitely* appreciate my art.... I know what I'm doing tomorrow.
I don't even have bathroom art for myself...
This is hilarious, I’m totally doing it! I think I’m gonna find pictures that my Kiki would really enjoy, like birds, mice, her canine sister and her favorite human servants.
All it needs is a newspaper clipping about some "local cat..." story.
Genius
So very cute. The cat seems to love it.
What kind of cat litter is that?
I use that same kind of litter! It's awesome!
This cat got better toilet entertainment than me, making me think long and hard about my life.
Cats seems to be enjoying it, so I would call that a success
This is so great. And the shnoodle is the icing on the cake. I am going to have to do this for my cats
Hahaha this is so cute. Nothing beats deep thinking while taking a good dump in the morning
Who leaves the scoop IN the litter box??
Sophistakitty.
looks like it is helping him relax
They have his pooper just hanging out in the middle of things?? Give the poor guy some privacy
My family used to hang up newspapers (and regularly change them out) on the wall next to the litter box so they always had a paper to read. Lol
Well he or she can't obviously hold a newspaper while doing so , this is the next best option. 👍
My cat shits in a pitch black closet. She gets it in the litter box more often than not
Omg and he’s staring at it too that’s nice
I've thought about this lol.
Leaving the scoop in the liter just blew my mind.
“I find the soothing pastoral images very conducive...”
I wonder if animals appreciate our silly gestures of love.
If that cat's anything like mine, those pics might be there to discourage it from pawing at the wall when it's done in an attempt to bury its poo.
For me it's just my cellphone and reddit.
Our kitty had a painting of city in the night on one side  and a huge plant with lots of foliage on the other side. 

We called it " She is a city girl on few days and a farm girl on the other "
I feel like a no lid litterbox is playing a dangerous game
Knowing cats it probably hates it
My cat would just pull them down into his litterbox and shit all over them.
A pic of a cat would be nice.
My real question is: Why does your cat poop in fiber one cereal?
"This book has been flagged."
This pic amazes me that how smol cat actually is. A certain feeling called “awww”
what is the weird blue thing that looks like a saucer and bowl filled with level oatmeal?
Is she sitting on cigarette leftovers
Is he shitting into hamster food?
Cute cat, so adorable😊😊😊
Stealing this idea thx
He needs a cat phone so that he can be cat-called.
Where's my biro?
Ha! That’s awesome
Now that's classy
Did the cat lose her phone?
This made me chuckle.
Love this! Pets need more art
That’s way too adorable.
This is hilarious.
“Why do you need a tiny 3 x 4 frame?” 
“It’s for a project, why do you ask so many questions?”
Post cards? I never thought of that
My cat would just paw at it until it’s not there..
That’s the same leash my vet gives out.
This is fantastic.
And paw sanitizer, too. How thoughtful!
Xd
This is awesome
Feline Pine?

My fluffy baby only uses it now, he won't poop or pee on anything else.
This is awesome
I love it.

I have a female and printed pictures of chonkers for my cat - she totally makes believe they don't exist.
This cat has better taste than me
bro this is so funny
I have a diamond art painting of big cats (lion, tiger, etc) in Chase’s food area.
I am stealing this idea!  Sorry friend!
Haha I love it! I wish at least one of them was just a picture of a litterbox, like how almost every person who hangs art in their bathroom usually has something with a toilet in it
We did this for my cat after his bladder surgery last year. He was sequestered post-surgery (from the other cats) and spent a lot of time just sitting in the box so my husband put up a photo of Suki cat for him to stare at!
Wow
A Spy's Goodbye to you all
My only question is how does this cat not make a mess around his litter box? Mine has a cave-like litter box that is completely covered minus the flap to enter and still makes a mess!
[deleted]
My mom writes me Mother’s Day cards from my cat and when they go on vacation she sends him a postcard, not me, and I pin them on the wall near his crap box for him to read.
I feel like a cat would appreciate pictures of birds and mice more.
Now that's a galactic shit right there
Should put up the newspaper, so kitty knows what's going on in the world.
Ask your friend what kind of car litter they have
That's basically 6-year-old me and fancy restaurants
Is that cat just dropping nuggets in the living room?
For the distinguished pooper...
Cat dgaf
That’s amazing. You should have them get some video of it. (Asking for a friend😺)
Our has her own hello kitty poster.
This is adorable I’d put some by my cats litter boxes but they’re pretty messy. I have a painting hanging by my cats’ cat tower though. I’ll post a picture tomorrow.
What breed of cat is that?
Does anyone else’s cat perch on the edge of the litter box like some kind of gremlin bird or is it just my idiot cat?
Hhhhhhhh the cat can't read magazins ...so it's good for him
Why are the pictures not of mice, dead lizards and birds?
"Are you going to be in there forever?"
Why does your kitty litter look like Mini Pretzel Sticks?
When a client says they'll pay you in exposure.
Lol, if I won the powerball I'd totally hang a Monet on the back of my bathroom door. Shitting with class.
Really you put the bathroom right next to the GIANT outlet??
My cat wipes her shit on the walls.
My cat gets to look at dirty laundry.
Why does all of reddit use litterboxes without lids ?
Lol that is so funny  bathroom art for your cat very kewl
At first I thought he was shitting in his food
Pictures of large bodies of water...

A cat's arch nemesis.
I. Fucking. Love. It.
Hmmm, yes, sublime.
Great idea and it looks like kitty loves it!!
The back of a shampoo bottle with all the ingredients would be nice IF YOU WERE THOUGHTFUL!!! HISSSSSS!
It’s cute!!!
That's one fancy cat, I just stare at a blank white wall like Wilson Fisk.
and mealworms for cat litter! how humane!
What type of litter is that?
Imagine having a litterbox in your house
Valid.
Omgggg wholesome take all the upvote
I’d steal this idea, but my cat has a covered box.
Is that cat shitting in cereal?
I’m stealing this!
Ok maybe this is weird but I think litter boxes should be in the bathroom, because the cats are using the bathroom and that should happen in the bathroom. 

I view litter boxes outside of the bathroom kinda the same way I would if I walked into someone's house and they had their people toliet in the middle of the living room.

Just seems weird.

But that is a cute pic of the cat looking at pics.
What a refined kitty. 


The nasty little vagrants I own would have kicked litter on those pics and pissed on them. The cats I have are so.... uncouth, I have to purchase top entry boxes and used heavy duty garbage bags as liners. 

Anyways. Anyone want a hateful unrefined cat?
All he needs is a cell phone now
I barely expell air from my nose while searching through reddit, and for some reason this gave me a good chuckle. Its so dumb hahah
Now I feel like a bad kitteh steward because I do not offer kitteh bathroom art.  :-(
Lmaoo this is the cutest thing.  It made me smile
The spectrum of human thoughtfulness is SO wide.
Get a sifting litter box for the pine litter! saves loads of time cleaning it
Lol you should put up pictures of cats in bikinis
That’s hysterical! The cat actually is enjoying it too!
I'm inspired.
I’m about to do this for my cat.
What’s the benefit of having this type of litter over the little sand type?
Hang this in the MoMa ✨
I feel like they missed the opportunity to put up pop art, so they can call it poop art
What is that litter?
Ahh the poop gallery
Cultured kitty.
We did bedroom art for my Boston. My BF cut out little food items from the junk mail and taped them above her bed. At night it looks like she is dreaming of little rotisserie chickens and a bunch of bananas.
LORT!
It's cute but not a great idea because
Keeping the cat walking around their own fresh pee is not a great idea
Tom Killion for the win!
Omg....boom
If my kids ever see our cat taking a dump outside they usually crack up laughing, point & stare at the cat who usually ends up looking annoyed at the hole situation.
What type of cat /brand /model /type /variation or what's it called is that?
Beautiful. I wish I had this talent
He's judging the art 😹
PiCATso
😂😂😂
Stare at the art... You should now feel mentally reinvigorated
I did the same for my betta fish. He had a small portrait of himself.
Sitting in a litter tray actually sounds like something someone would do as a social art piece
Like a little kitty vision board
Goals!
A gallery of art I see I find a place to sit

A gallery of art I see as I begin to shit.
He seems enveloped into the colors and landscape of the painting.
Why is that litter
Cute!! :)
mine managed to crap on the wall one day so there's no way i'm doing that but that's kinda cute ngl
Is my man shitting in shit
AT LEAST THEIR CAT USES ITS FUCKING LITTER BOX UNLIKE MY SHITTY GOD DAMN FUCKFACE OF A CAT.
Your friend either vacuums near the cat box after every shit, or they have a considerate cat. We all know which one is true.
What is this breed of cat? We see so many roaming around our areas in Nepal.
That’s hilarious
Had a cat named Merlin for 16 years. Loved that cat a ton and was hard to see him go. But, I will NEVER have another litter box in my house again. If i do get another cat it will sticktly be an outdoor during the day cat. I live in a rural area so it should be happy.
This is a brilliant idea and I'm printing out photos asap
I asked my girl if we could do this for our cats; she said “no they’d just scratch it off the wall.”
That is the most Innocent Sweetest act
Do the cat has the same taste as the master?
Now I know what to get my bf’s cat for xmas
Jesus christ he just poops in the damn hallway?
I put up framed pictures of other cats for mine in her bathroom! And a mirror so she can check her makeup if she needs.
They have their cat shit on Muslix?
Love this so much!
And the cat appreciates it. Cats are such deep and complex creatures
We have a stairway full of art. My wife put small pictures of various animals doing human things 9n the lowest level near the stairs. Claims it's for the cats. Glad to see she is only a bit crazy.
That's hilarious. 
Yo, what kind of litter is that?
thanks for the idea, i think i need some decorations too for my cat's bathroom
so do i.....doesn't everybody?
What kind of liter is that?
A lottt of designers do this in pet relief stations in airports to give them nice views while poopin’
I know a guy who has a cat and he said that they can't interpret characters at the resolution of those posters.  More like a /r/greeble behind it more than anything else.
hahahahahahahahaha
And a nice electrical outlet for a radio
I can greatly appreciate this, kitty thanks you
What kind of litter is that? It looks like little pellets. 

Does it still track litter all over?
That litter box looks like it's full of Kellogg's All Bran
And the cat actually looks at it.
Holy shit me and the s/o cannot stop giggling at this.
This is a crazy cat person with one cat
I saw the picture, and immediately showed my cat and asked her if she'd like bathroom art. She seems annoyed with me, much like every other relationship I've ever had.
I put framed pictures on the wall by my dog’s dish and bed for her to look at. It’s only thoughtful.
Cat:Hmm,nice art.I want to be an artist now!
Hilarious!  Kitty seems interested in the eye stimulation. 🐱
Haha, scaredy cat! Bleuuuh! *mirror* AAAHHH!!
@op dude thats my cat.   Message me ill send proof.
It's all fun and games untill he licks that outlet
Needs a classic birthday calendar
😹😹😹
Very civilized.
Can I be a cat too?
Friend should include one of a nice fish or a mouse and maybe one with his/her best friend.
And here’s a mine plow.
This is the best thing I’ve seen online all day. Thanks.
I love that!!
We have the same exact leashes at work w/our hospital name on them! Lol. That picture is adorable! I need to get some wall art for my cats!
No way am I the only to notice that the cat box is filled with cat food...
Your friends cat and my cat are doppelgängers. Me and my boyfriend are losing it
Stop spoiling them. my cat is expecting above average treatment and I'm trying to ween that behavior.
Your friend uses the worst kind of litter
Not related to the art, but what's up with that cat litter?? Never seen litter like that
Haha! Excellent!
What would your cat do with a mirror in the middle of its art?
I’m confused; is this your cat???
Lololol !
Hahaha!
That cat appreciates art without knocking them down!
Is that Swheat Scoop kitty litter?!?!
Unrelated, are those pellet things better than regular litter?
The cat seems to like it :)
Nice. My cat just shits on the floor beside the box
Rub tuna on painting, take photo
Cat of culture
What kind of kitty litter is that?!
Real focused on cali
You should have a miniature newspaper in frame like is at many bars/pubs have.
This made my day.
Finally I find someone else also using wood pellets as cat litter.
Very classy at Chez Shishi.
u/urduzubaan
My cat looks legit the same. Is it a short haired european?
If I had a cat I’d do the same! Thank you creative human!
You should send him a lady cat :)
That cat looks like the cat that popped up on my house on memphs tn
I too like to ponder the meaning of aesthetics while I drop a heinous deuce
Okay but my cat would piss on the art...
Have alot of cats. What type of litter is that? And what the benefit? Cost cleanliness, smell cover,environmental impact?
🥺
Good hooman <3
Lmao this got an actual vocal laugh out of me. Thanks.
So awesome
This is amazing.
I made portraits of my cat for her dining area. The largest is 2x3 inches. She was totally indifferent. 

[Fancy cat portraits ](https://imgur.com/a/iotrB1t)
Should have a female cat looking down with a shocked look on its face.
Where do you get that kind of litter from? 
Is it worth it?
I put art behind my turtle tank.
HAHA
mate ya forgot the toilet paper
Im doing this omg
e
Next up is showing number 1 aim accuracy on a mounted LCD screen.
IMO that cat litter is the worst but I know some people like it. Why?
what a artistic friend!
Seems to be enjoying it
everyone should look at something pretty while they poop
That cat reminds of George Costanza taking his shirt off to look at the 3D art poster in the bathroom.  “Anybody see that poster in there?  That is some weird and wild stuff..”
Where’s the sports page?
I can smell it from here.
LOL!!!!
This does put a smile on my face
Sure are a lot of stick pretzels in that litter box
That’s great!
Just gonna leave this here: [https://www.buzzfeed.com/sydrobinson1/cat-posts-week-september-28-2020](https://www.buzzfeed.com/sydrobinson1/cat-posts-week-september-28-2020)
Hahahah !  the cat is very cute with its own bathroom .
so gross
I have a question, where exactly is this cat box located?  Off of a living room or a kitchen?  The pictures are cute, but I don't know if I should be grossed out by it.
Is the cat pooping in that nasty bran cereal ?
Breathing used cat litter is so toxic ,you really should have it in an area no where near the living space
Who the fuck still does open litter boxes. Get a tub and a lid, cut a hole for entry, place litter box in hole. Let them shit in peace, hide some smell and not have to worry about friends coming seeing said shit.
Also has a friend who cant take a decent photo
Nice floor. Hope it stays that way!
It's so gross that people have a literal shit box in their house.

Then the shitty paws all over everything.
Side note: that litter is terrible.
That's nice but cats are farsighted so this is worthless to them 😂
Your title didn’t need “for their cat” in it.
Harsh facts: if you died in your sleep and you owned a dog, your dog would lay next to you and mourn and protect you from anyone that approached your body. Alternatively, if you died in your sleep and you owned a cat, your cat would eat you.
Dunno why people insist on putting their litter box inside instead of the garage or outside. Nothing says welcome home like the fresh aroma of cat piss

Cute tho
Guaranteed this person is single
It’s a fucking cat, What’s the art gonna do? Hypnotize it? Stop making animals do human things damn. Makes me sick.
