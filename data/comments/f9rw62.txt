I love that short pause he does when someone walks by in the background, and then continues with being ridiculously cute. He‚Äôs so fluffy!
I can't believe people have the courage of having such dangerous wild animals in their home.
Legolas, what do your elf eyes see?
Lil nose twitch.
You bow to no one, little bunbun üê∞
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I owe him my allegiance.
Oh my god the cuteness overload is too intense
Oh, the cuteness.
I am dying of cute!!!
Awww clean little cutie!
I love when my rabbit starts doing this. It means he feels safe (:
So adorable! r/facehugs would love him!
He looks like a stuffed animal that came to life... So fluffy!
When I do this, people don‚Äôt find it cute. :(
"*wash wash wash* Hey why you filmin'?"  
"For Reddit."  
"...okay. *wash wash wash*"
Well if this isn‚Äôt the best way to start my day then I don‚Äôt know what is!
I‚Äôm not going to be dramatic and say I love this bunny I‚Äôve seen once online....

But I would die for this bunny
I would have followed you my brother; my captain; my king.

aragorn's daily beauty routine before mordor
I literally gasped when I saw him. So preciou! He reminds me of my little bunny dude when he was a baby (he's almost 8 now).
I didnt think i would enjoy this so much, but thats so adorable!
Love the name
Omg this kind of video makes me want to adopt a bumny.
It makes me happy that ur bun cleans right in front of you. I've had friends with buns and they are always scared of their owners. Its really nice to see someone who obviously took really good care of their lil bun friend
what a good bunny
Good job, bun bun.
So cute! Reminds me of when my Rabbit used to do this. I sat down and watched him every time he did and then pet him after. Rest in peace Snowflake.
One does not simply hop into Mordor.
God damn it, rabbits are so god damn cute.
now i'm full of happiness, thanks bunny
I need more content of this majestic animal
Thank you <3
The logical next step is to get a dwarf bunny and name him Gilmi
Not all that is fluffy is shedding
I read that as Angron which is a really funny name for a rabbit lmao.
Aragorn looks soft, like a plushie. He is the one bun to rule them all!
An absolutely beautiful wee bunny. I hope you have many many happy years with him.
Ridiculously cute
This is adorable, but do you ever think animals get sick of our shit? Here we are all enjoying this bunny while it‚Äôs been filmed doing the mundane task of washing its face. I would hate it if I was filmed washing my face. I‚Äôm always filming my cats sleeping, when I think about it, it‚Äôs just creepy.
Where is Anduril? The sword that was broken!
Do you call him Strider?

I used to have a lop ear and loved watching it clean it's ears! So cute. Also people don't know that their ears start up and drop as they get older. Mine had one up and one directly to the side forever, then two straight out for a while before they both finally went down. Super cute.
u/vredditshare
Your rabbit looks like a Jim Henson puppet straight out of Emit Otter's Jug Band Christmas. I love him.
I have never in my life seen a bunny that looked more like Thumper from Disney‚Äôs Bambi. I thought they completely made up Thumpers coloring and fluffiness, now I know that bunnies like Thumper exist.
>My bunny Aragorn

You shall not pass, until you give snuggles.
His name sounds like you can find him at the end of the dungeon as a 3 stage boss character
Aragorn!

I would name him Bunny Sanders!
At what age did you stop calling him Strider?
I wanna kiss him
WHY *the* FUCK *are you so* FUCKING CUTE
That is no mere rabbit. That is Aragorn, son of Rabbathorn
How did you not name it Angoragorn?!
it's so cuteee...i wanna pinch it hehehe
Funny name for rabbit
Put aside the ranger, become who you born to be
The only interaction I ever had with bunnies were 2 who decided to fight after I was duped on letting them out of their cages by a malicious 9 yr old who knew better. Fur flying everywhere. That's when I found out I was allergic. The only thing in this world I'm allergic to and it's cute little fuzzy bunnies!! The world isn't fair.
That moment when he stop, he look like hes saying " Karen cmon, are you filming ? "
Trying to look cute for Arwen.
Aragorn fluff yourself

Love that name
I misread and thought your bunny was named angron (warhammer 40k) and now the idea of an a unbelievably fuck ass mad bunny with dual axes is stuck in my head
The extra floof makes this look like a bunny centaur, and I love it.
If I had a Dwarf Lop I would name him Gimli.
Looks more like a Gimli though
That is the best squee to see first thing on reddit...thanks for sharing Aragorn's abject cuteness!
The ears, the floof ... I just can‚Äòt handle that üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

How come most bunny's have weird names?
A little koala!
I can't put my finger on exactly why, but I imagine Jon Lovitz is your bunny's spirit animal.
That‚Äôs satisfying and cute at the same timeü§£
No offense to Viggo but I'd rather watch LOTR movies with this Aragorn.
I just melted from cuteness.
i love it
What breed is he?? He‚Äôs such a floof!!
give him some banana!
He‚Äôs so fluffayyyyy!

Love your name choice!

What a clean little face.
He looks cuddly
I‚Äôd die for Aragorn
ITS SO MOTHERF***ING FLUFFY!!
This is the cutest shit

Does anyone else feel like he should have a pinafore and a lovely China patterned wash basin in front of him with a cake of lavender soap?

A day may come when my face is gonna be in dirt and mud, but it is not this day!

An hour of filth, but it is not this day!

This day I clean myself!

By all that I hold dear on this good earth, I bid you clean with me, Rabbits of the West!
For the sake of public education, I'd like to post this here so others who are not aware of this scientific fact yet get enlightened and do not spread misconceptions about the sweet bunnies:

Rabbits do eat an intermediary stage product of digestion called cecotropes, which, though appearing as poop, is not the final product of digestion, i.e. the feces!

So, it¬¥s actually part of their biological cycle, and one utterly vital for their bodies being nurtured as due!

Here¬¥s a brief excerpt of one of the good sites educating the public about it:

 "**Rabbits‚Äô digestive systems can‚Äôt extract all the nutrients from food the first time it is digested. During the digestion process, soft pellets called cecotropes are formed. These contain valuable nutrients, such as protein and fiber. Rabbits eat their cecotropes to extract these nutrients by digesting them a second time."**

**More in**

 [https://www.rabbitcaretips.com/why-do-rabbits-eat-their-own-poop/](https://www.rabbitcaretips.com/why-do-rabbits-eat-their-own-poop/)
> What his right name is I‚Äôve never heard: but he‚Äôs known round here as Strider. Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; though he don‚Äôt tell nobody what cause he has to hurry.
Question, "My first post on reddit " Of your bunny, 8 months ago, then 3 posts of the same pic of your bunny on aww saying that it's your first post.
omg we need a Aragorn skincare routine!! <3
I would die for you Aragorn!

Ok but... does he get second breakfast?
This is my new favorite thing on reddit.
Aragorn sounds like a Nordic God that can smite the entire universe with his mighty sword, I really don't know the difference tho, this sweet furball will smite universe with its cuteness

I‚Äôm usually not into this sub at all, often rolling my eyes at the posts that show up on my popular feed.
But seeing this made me stop and exclaim ‚ÄòOh my god‚Äô

Maybe I‚Äôm not so jaded after all.
He's thinking "I'm so floofy, I'll never get clean."
Best name ever!
He is my king

Omg, he somehow does look like an Aragorn
Awww i have a rabbit too it's so cute when they do this!
Awe
Give me the child!
Such a powerful name for a fluff üíú
In the first few seconds, it looks like some sort of centaur bunny. The cleaning hands look like their on a torso, which is attached to the body, the front legs we see and the 2 back legs we can't see.
so sweet
You should‚Äôve named him Ganfluff the White
awwwwwwwwwww
My rabbit used to do that too, i used to melt whenever she did...
I would follow you to the end my brother, my captain, my king!
One does not simply flufffluff into munchmunch.
Hello, yes, can you please let Aragorn know that I love him?

Thank you!

(Also what a name, I love it. Aragorn is my favorite character in LOTR!)
the most sweetest!! please tell Aragorn i love him and he made my day so much better. xoxo
That's such a badass name for such a fluff ball
Holy fuck this bun bun is cute as fucking fuck.
I like the name. A person of culture.
I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs an excellent Strider.
Your bunny has really yellow paws. Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt let him stand in his pee. I have two rabbits so I think I know what I‚Äôm talking about. smh
I miss having a bunny!!!
This is so cute, my wife cried
NOOOO! he never got to washing is ears!!! I miss seeing that so much use to love watching it.

My bunny used to do this a lot and I would stand there and watch because nothing is more important than watching your bunny clean himself. Bunny hygiene is important

All I see is a bunny with a scat fetish. I don't judge though
I didn't even know rabbits could turn their paws inwards like that.
Clean boi
The way he looks at the camera toward the end like "Yeah, I'm cute. I'm clean. What more do you want from me?" was super adorbs...
Great now I have to find a way to convince my boyfriend we need a pet bunny
When it sees that its on camera oh shit this is baad i can let them see me bunys barin: oh its just a rock bunny oh ok continues cleaning

Rabbit - what you lookin at mfkr ? Myob
Fellow rabbit owner here, that face at 0:19 is pure terror. The person walking behind startled the lil guy. Still a little poof and probably not totally used to the ins and outs of his place, that was 100% a fight or flight face.

He resumed his cleaning pretty quickly though, so you can tell he‚Äôs seen it before :)
[And my axe!](https://imgur.com/a/sZW4Xva) ... This is my Gimli.
Do bunnies poop everywhere when they get out of cage?  I had guinea pigs years ago and you couldn't hold them or anything as they would immediately scratch you and poop everywhere.  I have a dog now who is the love of my life, but he has parkinsons and while I think he has 2-3 more years you never know.  I don't think my husband and I would want to adopt another dog until we have kids and they get to be at least toddlers, but I adopt a bunny if I knew it could get to the point where I could hold it and it wouldn't freak out.  It's so comforting cuddling something fuzzy and since my dog is 50 pounds, I miss having something small to hold.  Can anyone with rabbits tell me if that's how it is or if it will just be scratches and poop all over again?
Oh...my...goodness! He‚Äôs so fluffy!

Nothing cuter than a bunny rubbing its piss-soaked paws all over its face haha
I love it when my bunnies do this, easily the cutest part of bunny co-habiting (not ownership seeing as how they seem to think the house is theirs)
I initially read his name as "Armageddon" and it was a lot funnier of a name for a moment lol
How much did you say you were selling him for again?

Thank you! I needed a dose of cuteness! This rabbit is adorable!
Best. Name. Ever.
AAAAA YOU NAMED HIM ARAGORN!!!!! I'm so proud
This is some peak Reddit shit right here
Not so much ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù his face as covering it with rabbit spittle.
omg that's so cute
It's beautiful, I've been looking at this for 5 hours now
It's a little tiny floof!

Me when I wake up rubbing my face
‚ÄúMmh... gotta, clean dat... get... behind der, get up der... oh, hai.‚Äù
I wish I had a faction of the personality and character that this little dude has
Reminds me of my mini lop :) he was such a sweetheart
The previous image in my feed was a horse hair worm coming out of a dead spider. So this was really what I need right now.
Holy Shit, this little dude cleaned up every Reddit award there is. Three times over!
How cute. Does your bunny use a litterbox?
Rabbits are fun. I like your little Aragorn
I melt anytime my dog does this. My sister and I like to say hes being shy :)
Man, Aragorn. Near "angora" anagram.

That's pretty much a palindrome if you rearrange the letters.
üòÅ
He‚Äôs sooo FLUFFY!
Who's the cutest little D√∫nedain , you, yes you are <3
I wish we had sound.
Aragorn was my dogs name üíñ. He passed away in 2014.

Awww
And the dirty again shall be clean
When one ear perked up and he sat up on his legs 

My god 

Perfection.
That can make some nice wool.
So cute!! I love the way your rabbit is trying to clean his face and then looking at you! :)
Must freshen up before taking on the helms deep
I would 100% expect him to give me a quest.
I love your rabbit!
His hair is 100% cleaner than that dude from the movies.
Im gonna kick it 




With kindness



I named my spike tipped boods kindness
GONDOR CALLS FOR AID!
Why are you making him use his own spit to clean himself? Give him some dove ultra care body wash and conditioner in warm water with Espsom salts
Man, this resolution is *crispy*

Hey
I like how Aragorn stops and looks annoyed when the legs walk behind him : )
That's a lot of awards for a bunny
Preciosura
Wow ! Very cute bunny. I appreciate for sharing this video here :)
Oh mama it's sooo cuuuute!
I'll never understand why certain post get so many awards. Some very justifiable tho cause that is one cute bunny.

Return of the King
Stubble update - looking manly!
TOO CUTE! I need one now üòÇ
I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me. A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our pets and break all bonds of ownership- but it is not this day!
LOL, Aragorn!! Brilliant name for a bunny.
#not all who wander are lost.
Strider!
His adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è and has an awesome name.
Aragorn aka strider - LOTR

Anyone know what breed of bun this is? I've been wanting another bun in my life for a while and I think I just fell in love with this breed‚ù£Ô∏è

This rabbit was genetically engineered for Reddit karma
This is really cute...
Makes me want to ask for your address for a visit
Thumper!!
I think this needs to be the name of a badass character in some fantasy world.
Holy shit is that rabbit cute.
Aragorn is an awesome name!!
