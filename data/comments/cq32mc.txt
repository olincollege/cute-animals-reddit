It’s funny how they are both so chill
I love that the lynx is the startled one in that interaction...
Cat: look, it’s a bigger me! Am gonna wake it up
Are lynx(s?) dangerous?
Omg! They are so cute. Where do u live that you just have a spare lynx lying around? So jealous.

Guys! There are six, SIX [videos of this stuff!](https://www.youtube.com/user/inazicuc/videos) 

Also, it *is* a bobcat.

Edit: Thanks, stranger!!! My very first award!

Edit: Gold?! Thank you kind stranger!
Who are you? 

I am you but larger
serious, stupid question: would a lynx attack a house cat, and could a lynx easily beat up a house cat?
*Simba challenging Scar
Scar: wtf
Awwwww
Lynx: what the FUCK is that
“Oh.. OH SHIT”
All kitties are the same!
"WTF!?! Jesus.. hey.. you. *Shit not again I need to stop drinking*"
Pikachu meets Raichu
That's definitely a bobcat
"...did I shrink?"
Does anybody know a documentary about cats wherein one part a Bobcat or lynx went up to a house cat and backed off while the house cat was just chilling under a lawn tree with the narrator saying something in the lines of: "Even though the the Bobcat/lynx is wild, it knows who is king among the humans (or something)"?
And just like that, she wanted a lynx
“... How did you get on that side?!”
What do you mean "tiny"? They look about the same size to me.
Bobcat went from "Oh shit!" to "Oh, breakfast in bed!"
Thats not a doppelganger. Stupid OP
Well guess you can never let your cat outside again or it’s def gonna end up food for that Lynx
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Both of them are so cute
Lynx:(wakes up) who are you
Cat:I'm you
Lynx: I'm me
Cat:no sir you are you
"hi!"

^"h-hi"
That's a bobcat. Same genus as a lynx, but not a lynx. Looks just like my bobcat, Rufus 😍
Bobcat*
How does it not notice the giant human next to it
Cute
My cat did this to a lynx through my basement window and when I went to check on him he latched onto my face and I got some pretty bad cuts Haha poor guy was just scared
It's so great that neither of them were super scared or aggressive.  They are both just curious.  Two sweet little kitties checking each other out.
 the cat isn't dumb. he barricaded the door with wood before teasing the big cat
**Anyone else wanna see the rest of this story line?   Did they elope?**
That's not a doppelganger but OK.
"Wha....? Who da hec is you!?! Wh....? Wha you doin in der?!?
He looks it's Mini-Me!
I wouldn't really say that the house cat is "tiny". I mean, that Bob is only like 15 lbs or so.
RRREPOST
Reeeeeeeeeeeeee-post!
Repost
Isn’t that a bobcat?
Lynx or bobcat?
You sure that’s not a bobcat?
Cat: look, it’s a bigger me! Am gonna wake it up
Bobcat. Not lynx
My turn to repost this next!!!!!
So cute!
This video is too short.
Is it wrong that I want a lynx now
If that Lynx could speak it'd be like: Huh..? Uhm.. Oh who are you?
I love the lynx's momentary shock turned to gentle curiosity.
The courage of glass helped, too.
They could make a Disney animated short/movie about these two!
“Why can’t I smell you?”
House cat be like "hey hey hey, Join me n rule this house with our feline cuteness."
Damn can this be a Disney movie
Is that a big lynx?  Or...
Would the lynx just eat the house cat?
So he’s just preying on her.
Hey you’re finally awake.
Maybe through inability to hurt eachother they'll become friends and you could keep it
This is a repost. Remember seeing this a while back from the actual OP.
not so tiny, ya munch
The reflexes of that Lynx though 

Out here throwin hands
•cat sense tingles•

“You’re like me!”
Is there a longer video
Oh, hello strange little man.

A tale of two kitties
Such a pretty kitty
Cute!

Sooooooo cuuuuteeee
So cool to see!
Come play with me Tibbles.
No one is talking about how good the lynxes hearing is. A cat tapping on glass with its paw and it heard? That’s amazing!
Adorable but be careful, lynxes are much more vicious than they may appear 😬
Amazing!!
lol thanks. shared
“Oh shi...oh hello small me”
"you're like me..."

Hey buddy, wake up! Wake up!!!
Full video?
~~I find it amazing that the lynx is awoken by soft cat paws on a window.~~

In the video it's lightly tapping the window making a light sound.
Wow
*Dad?*
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
I remember seeing this on Youtube randomly because of the algorithm, it's pretty cute.
Cat wants it rough.
I wanna see the rest of the vid
Fun fact: lynxes eat housecats
Fyi, I'm pretty sure that's a bobcat, not a lynx. Very cool!

:,) buddies
Uhh lemme sleep, oh hey i've got the wares if you got the coin.
I love living where I am now, I've seen so many different animals on my way home at night, Foxes, Bobcats, lots and lots of deer.  Before I had never seen any foxes or bobcats.  I would love to get this close to a lynx, as long as there was some glass between us!
I’m just going to save this....
Dont look that tiny to me
So cute
Creeper?
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Cats will be cats 💙
'Hmm..? Who's knoc.. Oh hey handso.. AH! You're not me! Hey, what's up? .'
Holy shiznit! Oh, it’s just you. Ayo, whattsup blood(wimpy, slightly overweight version of your’s truly.)  Bro, you slacking! Need to do sum planks or sum...,They treating you right? What?! They sleeping on a playa? Don’t trip, I got you fam. ( slides dead mouse through cat door ) I’ll check you later. Stay safe!
I'm watching this... Then my cat molest my hand! What to make of it, idk.
Both of them are so chill
I'll need more than 9 live to survive these constant attacks.
The cat is closer in size to the lynx than I would have thought. So a maine coon is probably very close in size, if not some of the huge males being even bigger. 

But the lynx moves it’s paw even faster than a normal cat could for sure
Lynx is the animal of tavastia proper region :D
AAAHHH it ended to quicklyyyyy!!!! I want to see more!
I REALLY want to see this whole interaction. It seemed like they got along so suddenly then it stopped. :(
Hehe ginger cat is friendly.
Holy shit, I rescued a kitten that is the size of the car, and exact same characteristics an a lynx. I named him Cat Miller,. Rip Mac
Are those animals safe to interact with?
OmG fOrTnIte
Mom? Is that you?
It’s so adorable
Lynx: 💤

Cat: Hey bro...... pat pat..... BRO!!!

Lynx: Yeah man, hang on I - OH FUCK!
That doppelgänger ain’t tiny
Damn , that's soooooo cute

r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Reminds me of that picture when a cat sits by a window and behind the window stands a cougar (I think). They put some words on the picture: "Mom, aunt Carol is here!"
Lol weird
“How did you get on the other side!?”
Hare 2 Cats?🤣
“Cat? Cat! Cat?”
“Big cat! ...dad?”
Did they meet again?
I like it
thanks

Bigger cat see smaller cat fren
What country is this in?

I am indoor you
It's just a big kitty, boys!
Little floof meet big floof
Serious question. Is a feline's sense of smell strong enough to smell through glass?
Wouldn’t be as cute if the glass wasent there
“yoooo wtf happened to you?!”
Cat is like a store employee telling a homeless to move on.

"Hey buddy...hey...sorry you can't sleep here, there's a nice park down the street though"
"Bro, wtf it's like in the mor... Yo, dude you look like me.
His name is wallnut?
How did you ever capture this moment?
I like this  **tiny doppleganger**
Hey Cuz, wake up! This guy is recording you.
How receptive are Lynx or Bobcats to taming?
"You're like me."
I always wondered if bigger cats attack or try to harm cats. Would a lion consider a house cat as prey?
I LOVE THEM
Cars who understand windows like mine does they talk hella shit to murderous neighborhood cats three times their size. So funny to watch.
They prefer to be called distant cousins.
A lynx in your backyard? Do you live in canada?
Tbh the cat doesn’t look that much smaller than the lynx...
I want a Lynx

Is this a Chrono Cross reference?

Someone needs to put the Metal Gear sound effect when it notices the cat.
It's like 'who are you??, why do you look like me?'
that cat touching the window is too damn pure >.<
What...are...you...?
"oh hello sir , how may I help you ?"
What happened to me !!!... Oh wait, that's not a mirror
they look like they wanna be friends
So many tiny toes!
The house cat is almost as big as the lynx.
cuties
aww it's so adorable :)
I'd love to see a thousand teddy bears
N-NANI
AWWWWWWWWWWWW😭😭😭
Lynx: what are you?
Cat: I am you but smol
Breakfast in bed?! Well I never..
Wouldnt a lynx predate on a house cat?
I wish I could give u reddit platinum
Lynx "TF bruh?!"
"fuck off yah spooky midget!"
Is you me?
Hi -- excuse me. Fuck off. Thanks.
Doppelgänger*
Sniffy sniff sniff sniff !

Ahahaha they both do it.
Not a Lynx.  That's a Bobcat.
When your annoying brother wakes you up mid-dream
I thought you took your cat to the zoo
But then what happened?!?
This is so cute!
"Hey, wake up"

"Who are you?"

"I'm you, but smol"
Sweet
When you spend the night at your brothers house and you wake up to see your niece staring at you
Is doppelganger german, it really feels like
What the fuck?! Oh Hey.
Why do people post old YouTube videos without giving cred to the original poster https://youtu.be/qlSEqVdNjQw
Super kool. Lynx are so great. Seen a few & wild & the way they cover terrain something to see.
Why does it end so soon!?
That is so sweet but FORGET living somewhere where those things are. They are massive I'm sure i'd lose some limbs...
they are both cats yes but dont look like each other at all. would they still be considered doppelgangers?
That’s really cute
What's that sound? Whoa spooky midget! - Lynx probably
A lynx even being seen by a human is so darn rare that this is just incredible.
What would happen if the door opened?
I'll op
More please
Son: heeeyyy dad???....                                                    
Dad: *waking up* WHAT IS ITS, ITS EARLY O CLOCK, AND IM TIRED OF YOUR SHIT TIMMY
That universal "I'm friendly" eye blink at the end...
I would like them to cuddle :(
Would like to see the full video.
"This house is protected! Move along!"
Looks more like a bobcat. Cute video, though!
„Run boy, run! They‘re gonna enslave you!“

How do you even dare/think to have a lynx, bobcat or mountain lion as pets? Scared the shit out of me. Thought of getting a cat but yeah kinda scared now.
It's a bobcat not a lynx
The Lynx just looked shocked to see the cat
That’s a bobcat you nobbin

Brother?
That's a bobcat. I don't know if a bobcat is also called a lynx, but I saw a flash of that stubby tail, so I'm sure it's a bobcat!
Not a lynx. A bobcat.
I love it but isn't that a Bobcat? It doesn't look like it's gained enough XP to be a lynx yet.
Is that a dog. Well done!
"it's like looking in a tiny mirror!"
More like cousin from another gene pool

“Who are you?”

“I’m you... but smol-er”
It’s a bobcat. Look at its paws.
This is a bobcat. Its ear tufts are too short for a lynx.
Cat: Hi

Lynx: zzzz... uhhh huh? DA HEK?
Haha, people in my school use them as flamethrowers
