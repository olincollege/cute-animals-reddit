Well? Did they give it to him?
* Get dog costume
* Gather a bunch of leaves
* Profit
If this is true then it's the cutest thing that has ever happened
Aw look at that belly you can tell that good boi is well fed.
If my dog‚Äôs bowl didn‚Äôt already have food in it, she would never find it. It‚Äôs always amazing how smart some dogs are, compared to my dog.
It‚Äôs Colo‚Ä¶.nevermind, you got it right!
With this golden leaf, I can buy 1 lunch
I hope they gave that good boy some food!
It‚Äôs worth more than a Ruble.
I tried this too, didn‚Äôt work for me.

I‚Äôll just leaves it to him
My dog is ripping me off!!
I‚Äôd overcharge it. That‚Äôll be 12 leaves please

I has leaf, I get food?
Oh, he's still on the old Golgafrincham system
For fuck's sake, give that dog some damn food!
I taught my beagle how to exchange walnut shells from the back yard (and squeakers from his furry toys) for treats. This is basically the same thing.
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN MY MONEY IS NO GOOD HERE."
He should do a course at the University. Then he will have a pedegree.
I mean, it‚Äôs basically the same thing
Sorry, all I have is a Maple.   Or do you accept palm fronds?
Did anyone tell him money doesn‚Äôt grow on trees!
They had better have taken his money
This is not unexpected behavior.  Dogs gain the mentality of a 3 year old over the course of their entire lives.  This is exactly something a 3 year old would do.  A mimic of commonly observed behavior, but slightly off.
Good day, madame!  I'd like one food, please.
I‚Äôd give him the food just because of how intelligent the dog is.
Dog smart. It noticed pieces of trees being used as currency
I love dogs so much
Sir I‚Äôm going to have to ask you to leave(s)
Do you accept Dogecoin?
Give him anything he wants.
This is the first time I've seen Colombia spelled the correct way on Reddit. Nice.
I see he‚Äôs learned the trick of creating money out of thin air, just like the government and hedge funds!
Hello. One food please.
Tried and succeeded right? ‚Ä¶..RIGHT?!?!?!
Ok who tf taught the dog about capitalism
I just hugged my dog because of this post.
Must give him food! I will pay for him!
I see he's been reading The Restaurant at the end of the Universe.
Dogs are just too good for planet earth.
*‚ÄùHerro, I was told you take TreeBank?‚Äù*
Probably more buying power there than a stack of rubles.
Sad even the pup is now a pawn in the wage / labor / product quagmire :(
Leaves are now a currency in my store for dogfolk
I haz cheezburger? ü•∫
good dog 

![gif](giphy|R6gvnAxj2ISzJdbA63|downsized)
‚ÄúOne human treat, please. Keep the change.‚Äù
Ofc it's a lab!
This is the best thing I've ever seen.... 

If a dog ever gives me leaves, I'm selling him anything he wants for them. THIS IS THE TRUE PATH TO SOCIETY!
Richest dog in the world.
Leaves, the universal currency. üçÅ
In Moscow, dogs not only use the subway but they know which stops to get off at where the food vendors are.

Probably lots of big cities too, I just remember reading that particular factoid.
Please tell me you fed that sweet, resourceful and hungry dog
Those actual leaves could sell as collectibles and be worth more than most cryptocurrencies. I‚Äôd keep every one of them. üê∂‚ù§Ô∏è
That is so cute!!
We've trained crows to pick up trash in exchange for food, now this.

1000 years from now perhaps we'll have an interspecies economy, where animals provide services on a voluntary basis in exchange for various forms compensation.
Tried? Better fucking have succeeded.
I don't understand why my payment method keeps getting rejected
Can I get some?
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs a good customer?‚Äù
Dogs understanding money would be a frightening situation.  
   
I'm not ready for being attacked by a pack of 6 stray dogs going after my wallet.
I can guarantee with 100% certainty this is not what the dog was doing. He saw a leaf, saw a human, and wanted to play fetch. That's it
üíï‚ú®Sooo sweet I hope someone got him a meal ‚ú®üåª
They better have given him some food
If this was the US the dog would have been tazed for counterfeiting and being black
‚Ä¶ yea, that‚Äôs totally why he‚Äôs doing it..
It's cute but I have a hard time believing it.
4 leafs = 1 stick
I would buy him one of those doggie backpacks and stuff it full of leaves. I bet he would then think he is one of the richest dogs in the world.
Get a real job, dog.
lol I saw the "tried" in the title and became red with rage. Doggo better have SUCCEEDED in getting his food, a backup proper doggy bag of scraps to take home, lots of oohing & aahing, AND an immediate ear skritch & "Good Boy."
If I ran that cafeteria.. I'd have a bunch of leaves and he'd probably be obese.
So they fed the dog right
What if dog was one of us‚Ä¶üé∂
I want to donate so he gets more food :(
Animal Behaviorists: "WRITE THAT DOWN ***WRITE THAT DOWN!!!***"
We don't deserve dogs.
So money does grow on trees! What a smart sweetie pie.
They better have given that dog some damn food!
His money is always good here
Dogs always do the right thing. They are truly mans best friend.
Awww My heart.. he can buy stuff from me any day, his money is always good with me...I want this dog someone send him to me plz
Good boy
"I don't care what they say, his money is good here."
Dude, may I ask what university do you attend to? I'm from Colombia as well and it looks awfully familiar
Aww this is adorable!
I love him üíï
this would have worked in Russia
Money doesn't grow in trees , yes it does for you  doggy!
Well give him his food
This will be my go to when ever i hear "Dogs are stupid"
They better have given that good boi his change too.
give that gentleman some food!
Tan bello e inteligente.
hungry beings will resort to hustling for some grub
"Ma'am, I hope this will suffice"

*vomits up golfball*
This is a freaking Einstein among dogs.
I hope doggo got the right amount of change so he can come back for more
Someone please give him some food !
They better have given him something
Such a good boy!
What do you mean _tried_?
I mean, both money and leaves do come from trees, I say let him have food!
 Valid Payment. He worked hard to earn those leaves.
I‚Äôm gonna cry
OMG. That‚Äôs adorable.
Give Doggo Monches.  Pronto!
Still worth more than the ruble.
"Ma'am, I've got a bone to pick with you. I'll leave it at that!"
I'm about to send my dog into bestbuy with some leaves and see if I can get a 75" tv!
He makes like a tree and leaves. Yes I know, it doesn‚Äôt make sense for this narrative but still thought it was cute :)
GET THAT MAN SOME FOOD ü•∫
Cargo cult mentality
Not the good boy we needed. 

But the good boy we deserve.
Why does it make me sad?
Tried?! Tried?! What do you mean tried?
Intelligent dog up rising is coming!
Please use this dog in the education of morality.
"Sorry sir, we only accept bark here."
That's a nic nac, Patty Wack, give the dog a bone.
Tell Mr. Doggo about inflation... His kibble costs two leaves now and he gets 25% less.   But, according to the package "New Look, Same Great Taste"!
![gif](giphy|AJUB4zXLWDkZy)
Why yes little doggo we do take leaves
I‚Äôm sorry sir but your currency isn‚Äôt accepted here‚Ä¶.. is what I would‚Äôve said if he wasn‚Äôt so darn cute.
My dog always brings me his toys when he wants a snack and we have a little exchange.
A wolf of Wall Street
A business man indeed
That is a good dog.
I‚Äôm more impressed that the dog goes to Columbia.
Really! I am continually amazed at the extreme brilliance of animals!!! Amazing sweet puppy!!! Yea
My dog brings me his toys when he wants something
I‚Äôve never had such a genuine laugh out loud moment! Amazing.
Hope he got food!!
Worth more than rubles
Give that damn dog an award
So we are observing tool use among dogs now?
Give him food. NOW!!
Your money is good here dog‚ù§
I would give my life for that dog.
Would totally give that dog food every day for leaf payment!!
Dogs are incredibly smart, but each day I discover more about how TRULY incredibly smart dogs are.
‚ÄúHello fellow students, I would like to purchase som of your fine food please‚Äù
Capitalism has crossed species.  Economos is pleased
Uy √©sa empanada se ve re-buena, he's a good boi tho
Bruh, ain't they got Visa/MasterCard in Colombia?
I want to believe...
We must make him understand he deserves everything and has to pay for nothing ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
I love him.
Look at that graying little snoot !!!! 

 I need a one way ticket to Colombia to pick this lil doggo up ASAP
The dog rocks. It totally deserves that food.....and a job. Let no good deed go unpunished.
Ok but did the Doggo get the items they clearly paid for?

Follow up please!
Certainly 'awwwwwww'
He's so smart!
This breaks my fucking heart, if it‚Äôs real of course.
oh great they broke him by teaching him capitalism
since some seem confused, it seem this would be in the country of. columbia, bc that is what in columbia means. not columbia university in new york.... that would be at columbia
&#x200B;

Let's go for shopping
That's A Good Dog. Get Him A Manwitch.
Crows have learned how to use a vending machine. 
https://youtu.be/1qSsVBPh9Lo
So this dog hasn't just been praised for bringing leaves to the counter but rather deduced the concept of fiat currency through mere observation?
That is amazing! Haha!
Such responsibility!
Money doesn‚Äôt grow on trees
Logic at its finest.
Thats fucking adorable
Damn, he‚Äôs really sharp.
I would give him a home in a heartbeat!
‚ÄúThat will be 2 leaves and a stick‚Äù
Next time, try the green leaves!
OH MY FUCKING GOD SOMEONE FEED THAT DOG IMMEDIATELY üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Well, did you take his order?? He deserves to be rewarded...with food.
so clever
Fake AF
Give him all the food he wants
Cleaning leaves off the ground to help improve the aesthetic of the place. What a helpful little doggo üòÉ
Finally. I am sick of all the liberal socialist dogs looking for a handout 

/s required*
Billshit.
They're evolving. "Where are my balls Summer?".
Give him some damn food
GIVE HIM THE FOOD
If those humans didn't give that dog food, they need to go live on the farm up north and take care of all the pups there as compensation. Here puppers take the keys to the store!
No he didnt
Bollocks
Being in Colombia, was it coca leaves?
Dog probably got confused and thought they accepted Rubles
[removed]
Yea no that's not at all how dogs work and you're a fucking liar for posting this shit and a moron for believing it.
13 yr olds be like omg this is so deep :0
So smart!
Good boy
I guess money *does* grow on trees for that good doggo
100% would work on me.
OMG that is unbelievable how smart they can get
When you‚Äôre that cute, money ready *does* grow on trees
Holly hell he spelt it right
This dog made me smile!!  Got really bad news today & needed a ‚Äúpic‚Äù me up.
Good boi
That is so adorable it actually hurts
*and succeeded.
Local canine population now carrying out small jobs for leaves.
I‚Äôm willing to fight a war to ensure that dog gets his food.
I call bullshit
[deleted]
I know it's the wrong sub for this comment, but I would certainly take a leaf over a certain currency right now
"He's starting to believe"
We have corrupted another species with money :(
Capitalism starting to spread to the animal kingdom i see.
He must have tried to trade sticks with the fletcher
![gif](giphy|qaJ5WKys5NnZm)

They're learning!
Leaves worth more than rubles
"Sorry sir, we dont have enough change to break a leaf, would you happen to have something smaller?"
Good hedge against the USD
He could have whatever he wanted
This is awesome. Feels like maybe it was set up though. Really hard to believe a dog would put 2 & 2 together on this one.
I hope it worked
WHO'S CUTTING ONIONS?!
This is so heartwarming. I love dogs.
What's in HIS wallet?
Dog iq :100
Serve the man!!!
Genius dog if he thought of this himself
He's a little confused, but he got a spirit
Close enough!
What a good dog
Ratio
What‚Äôs up with that lady‚Äôs arm?
Quiere salir de LATAM
We are basically one inch away from a "planet of the dogs"-scenario now
Hello
Did he get the food tho?
Give him a heckin snack!
No silly dog... you need currency to purchase food.
So you fed him, right?!
exchange rate: 1 money = 1 food
He do a transaction.
crypto bros be like
A good dog knows when to leaf.
Metacognition!
Feed the heckin dog!
Time to economically integrate them $$$
Where is his tail?
Wow that is a great looking dog
So smart, thats a shame that hes going around collecting leaves because he thinks it will get him food.
I hope he got a receipt.
Smart doggo
I want that doggy üòú
He cant grab coins, neither bills, so with leaves must the doggy pay
They‚Äôre evolving‚Ä¶
My ass
For that dog, money truly does grow on trees.
‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a thing. Gimmie‚Äù
and they say money doesnt grow on trees‚Ä¶
Is he the economist professor?
holy shit evolution before our very eyes
Could it have any scientific implications about how and if non-human animals get the idea of trade?
doggy see doggy doodoo
Good boi
hey that cat can get a snack too with leave who gonna stop him?
Aww
(X)
Life hack, you can now pay your rent with leaves. -Dog
at least they print less of those these days...
ohhh, my hearttt!!!
Good boy so polite. I hope he got some food.
huh,  my dog just uses her cuteness and wiggle butt and doesn't need a leaf like this doofus!
GIVE THE DOG SOME FOOD WTF
No shirt no service
Looks like a little taco.
Yes, that will be 7 leafs exactly.
How old is this?
Why is this making me want to cry? ü•∫
Doggo does a capitalism
Anyone know which breed he might be?
Smart doggy!   


Now some bright kiddo should put on a dog costume and try to buy food with some leaves.
Worth about the same!
He didn't want to spend his Bitcoin.
He's a little confused, but he got the spirit
Reminds me of a cat i had when i was a kid.

When she was hunry she would bring us a sock or one of her toys and drop it on our lap or at our feet.
This would across the border in Venezuela
Probably the most well educated being on campus.
Looks like my dog
They fucking better have accepted its currency
There‚Äôs an indigenous culture in IIRC South America whose word for money translates to ‚Äúsad leaves‚Äù.
I can haz fooz wit leefz?
Colombian here, yeah dog economy is going crazy too
Up dog
Omg my heart, I‚Äôm crying ü•∫
I hope they gave that dog whatever he wanted
now teach that dog to make stuffs and reward him
Somebody gets this doggo a sammich
This dog has more money to buy his food than I have
This is the cutest thing ever
Animals think, this one understands a truth that most humans currently don't. Money is theatre. Its worthless like the leaves on the ground, it has many of the same properties. We think it has value because we have lied to ourselves so successfully. Where this dog has gone wrong is that he has given humans the benefit of the doubt.
D'awww, what a good boi ü•∫ü•∞
How does this not count as animals using tools? Either animals are way smarter than we think they are or using tools isnt as impressive a feat as we chalk it up to be (ego).
These are good things about being alive. Its sad that we have to find these good things
Doggie was probably like ‚ÄúDo you accept my kind of currency?‚Äù
Hope they explained it to him
Awwww I hope they gave him something
/r/DamnThatsInteresting
That‚Äôs a smart fucking dog.  Also I hope they found it a home
Doge
r/nextfuckinglevel
That may be the cutest thing I have ever seen.
‚ÄúDog is taught trick and is photographed while performing it.‚Äù
That's probably worth more than a russian ruble
Stop because this is so wholesome and I love it
I don't believe you, but cute dog.
Well, in this era, leaves from trees ARE getting scarce, so he is doing his due diligence!
Well, isn‚Äôt that just the most precious thing you‚Äôve ever seen?
He didnt try, he succeeded.
At least he didn‚Äôt steal
So cute!
Doggo wants taco üåÆ üê∂
Gran papaya
Colombian dog elite af
Good boi
They only accept doge coins.
r/petthedamndog
His name is Smartie McJingleberries
Such a beautiful being
I told my little sister to pay with leaves at the corner store when we were very young
Next thing you know that dog is gonna witness a politician and join the Republican Party
Irony
He/she is a business dog doing business.
"hey where mah change?"
Soon the dollar will have the value of a leaf too
‚ÄúYour money‚Äôs no good here!‚Äù
That‚Äôs fucked up, when I do the same thing they tell me to stop bringing dead leaves into the building
Money doesn't grow on trees, pupper.
Is there a video?
poor baby is hungry
That's one hot dog
Omg they‚Äôre learning.
Beat it Dog! Your leaves ain't no good here.
That doesn't look like legally valid currency at all
Dang that‚Äôs one smart dog! r/likeus
Always amazed at animal intelligence
good boyo
This  almost made me tear up
Lol I thought he had a taco in his mouth...
So wonder if they give him acorns for change. I know .. shut up
GIVE HIM THE FOOD
This is the saddest, then sweetest, thing I've seen.
Students over there are buying food with leaves?
Stimulating the economy, I see.
Cap
*Everyone liked that*
It's confirmed. Money does grow on trees.
Paying in leaves...prolly worth more than the petrodollar now! Smart boy!ü•∞
Oh my god, if they didn‚Äôt give that good boy some food I swear to god I‚Äôll fly there myself
Money is the biggest ‚Äúwool over sheeps eyes‚Äù that has ever been.
great

we corrupted the dog
My dog would totally do this.
I‚Äôm glad no one is thinking to much into this. 

Cute stuff 

*emoji hearts*
I think I remember seeing the original post a while back, they have a jar of Dog biscuits for this good boy, he pays in leaves because he spends most of his money playing poker with the other dogs.
A canine of the bread line
For this dog, money does grow on trees
Did they give him the food?
One of us. One of us.
All of us giving our own dogs the side eye right now.
I was in Villa de Leyva today and those dogs are seriously like people‚Ä¶ I definitely believe this
This is the way.
Such a good boy! ü•≤
awwwwwwwwwww
Maybe train him/her to pay for snacks with litter. Give a dog a job.
Colombia is an Ivy League school, even the dogs are smart
Praise the turtle
Dogs like to show people things they find. I doubt it‚Äôs money he thinks he has to pay for food.
I mean I want to believe but I have my doubts
Humans do not deserve dogs. They are too pure.
En que universidad esta? :(
Responsible doggo
This is everything! üíï
I guess I'm going to Colombia now.
1 quarter portion!
At least they got currency
That's is AMAZING dogs r sometimes mind blowingly smart
To be fair, Money is paper and paper came from trees. Just like leaves. I'm hoping they gave him a change?
He thinks he‚Äôs people awwww that‚Äôs the cutest thing ever ty for posting that !
Smart dog!
You get leaves then I leave wiff grub?? He thinkin haha
Let him have it
This good boi really knows how to pull himself up by his boot straps.
WOW!!!
Evolution.
Yeah? How do you the dog wasn‚Äôt proposing to one of the girls?
Can I adopt it
Awwwe give em some food
And how can not accept that leaves with out smaile and give to him Foood? T-T aswww
I would 100% give it a treat for that
yet another reason I love dogs!...don't even care if this is true or not.  It feels true so I'm gana chase that feeling haha
Well at least the dog knows that leaf is worth more than the actual Colombian currency
If dogs think money is worth the same as leaves, what does that say about our economy?
And the hundred other times I‚Äôve seen this is he buys a cookie every day with a leaf at a college cafeteria.
tried purchasing food. yeah, no.
People will make up anything and then upvote , garbage
What a fucking idiot
It did no such thing. Only animals that can extract meaning from behaviors can do anything like this. Humans are the only animals known to have this ability. It's known as memetics (yes, memes) and dogs don't do that.
What a smart dog. Sweet and cute as well. Aww
So smart!
Very smart pooch.
S/o everyone who thinks dogs are stupidüòÇ
Are we sure this dog isn‚Äôt just LARPing RPG fetch-quests?
One leaf = all the food.
Oh my god... My heart.
Serve that fine boy up
He was a buisnessman, doing buisness
Can I adopt that dog?
proof that money grows on trees
Where are all these smart doggies...all we have in campus are dumbasses XD, but really friendly and always up for some patting <3
I can‚Äôt be the only one that thought that was a taco
I‚Äôm gonna cry
The dogs are learning about capitalism
r/barklikeyoubelong
Good boy.
Hook it up!!!
Dogs are so smart!
Pretty sure this dog is smarter than some of my co-workers
ü§≠ü•∫
Awe....
That's just darling
The goodest boy
So wholesome ü•∫
This makes me want to cry
Awwwww
That is one very clever dog
Sorry, dog.  Treats are now three leaves.  Inflation.

\*sad pupper noises because of inflation\*
Empanada y Kumis, que delicia!
Should've told him "Sorry, but leaves are not used as currency here. You're thinking of Venezuela."
No, Colombian dog, that only works with coca leaves. . .
He should have used coca leaves
Can we repost this a few more times? It‚Äôs only been on the front page like 5 times this year so far.
