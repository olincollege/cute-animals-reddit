How do these cats not freak the hell out at being in a new setting? 
"Why did you not complete your assignment?! You lousy stupi......\*awwwwwww\*
Awwwe it was so cute and sleepy!! Where do you work??
At first watch, I thought the fur of the coat was the cat. Then surprise, another cat! Catception.

What if it has to pee?
Angela?
That cats as comfy as an opium prince in a heated water bed.
I'd imagine any company having a "bring your cat to work" day every so often would be much more attractive to work at than those without
There is no way work happened with a kitty that cute there!
Just make sure its not a wire chewer. My cat went through so many cords as kitten. Thankfully none of them were plugged in.
I didn’t like cats until now
AWWWWW
That is so adorable!!
Omg what a perfect little angel
Just made the most inhuman noise, so cute!
Its been a awhile since uve been envious of another person. Congratulations, I miss my cats I grew up with. 
You can tell this kitty has been working real hard today.
Why did you wake the poor thing up!
That kitty has put in a HARD day's work. Poor thing... 
nobody said the cat had to work 
As far as I'm concerned that cat can go wherever it wants.
Aww. You got a good one there. <3 
streeeeeeeeeeeeetch
Big yawn for a little kitten
Awwwww i love sleepy kitty stretches!!!
I’ve been owned by 3 cats and I couldn’t bring any of them to work and expect them to behave themselves 
"What do you need Steve, can't you see I'm having a power nap?" 
Cats got it figured out, if some giant brought me to work and let me sleep in his winter coat all day,  I'd be purring too
So cute cat I want  to work with you in your office .
Whaaat? I’m on break....get Susan to run your damn copies....
She helping 
They need a human sized version of that bag.  I'd sleep in it too.
Why would you wake him, you absolute monster 
This is cute and all but were is it gonna shit? like do they have litter boxes in the place or do you take it outside? genuinely curious as I do not have a cat. 
Well fuck, this is officially the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. 
Cats are simply born wrapped in comf (ortable)
Aww so sweet
I just instinctively mimed that cat’s movements.  
Don’t bother me, I’ve only had 17 hours sleep today.
Omg when it just curls back up!
I thought the fur coat thing was the cat lol
In that moment they were the coziest creature on this planet. 
I once interviewed at a restaurant with a secret pet cat chilling at my feet. I thought, "this is great! It's meant to be!" I disliked that place from day one... And I never saw the freaking cat again.

Also, their health code violations went beyond the restaurant mascot napping in the kitchen.

Probably should have seen it coming though. That one is on me.
Are yall hiring? Awww
with cats as company one is always aware of whats important in life and whats not that much
When is your IT department upgrading to Win 10?
Does your boss make sure all staff are allergy-free?
Tell your boss efficiency will improve if you bring it everyday 
Nice try. That ain’t your cat and that ain’t your vid. Also, you post like 30 times a day. WTF is your job?
Cute? Yes. 

Am I deathly allergic? Yes. 

This does not give me the feels. I’d be pissed if my boss did this.
That's cute. But as someone with severe cat allergies, your boss can go fuck himself/herself.  


Paid leave for me, until such time as the office receives an intensive clean.
Oh no, it's way too adorable 
Thought it was a skunk for a moment

Sending love. 
"its ok"? Like did you ask him if you could specifically bring your cat into the office? 
the longest aww ever was just conceived now.
That's a weird looking cat...

oh it's just your jacket.

Cute cat though. I love the little paw stretches!
I dont even like cats and that's a beautiful thing 
This might be the cutest fucking cat I've seen all year.

Sign me the fuck up
this is the cutest shit I’ve ever seen
Why did You post the same thing twice?
Squeeee
This is how I yearn to feel. Also how I imagine ecstasy. 
Who dare wakes me from my slumber 
Adorable !
I need to work where you work.
You monster you woke em up!
u/webrokebad
Lol tell me this is imgur head office. 
Damn those are very close stations to work at.
I’m guessing only a tech company would allow such shenanigans. 
I thought there was a hidden chewbacca under the desk lol 
This kitty makes me giddy
Super cute.
Boss, make it everyday!
((((((comfy))))))
Squeeee!
My heart just melted a tiny bit 
Streeeetch!
At first i thought the fur of the coat was the cat
I'm more of a dog person but that's the cutest Kitty, holy shit I want it
god, i really want to adopt a cat, i’m just not ready to support one financially but even i was. i don’t think i’ll ever be ready to adopt one, the responsibility! i feel like i’ll let it down :(
This is soooo cute! You should post this on r/tuckedinkitties
Legit thought the cat was a blanket
Is it weird that I’m more intrigued by the lumbar support? That shit looks comfy as hell, no wonder that kitty is so sleepy!
Stretchums!
..cute...very cute
Is that a razor mouse on the desk? Imagine doing office work with a mouse like that...
Already adopted the work ethik there...
 I would get absolutely nothing done. 
Omg! The best! I brought my cat to work once but I had to hide him in my office. I had the litter box under my desk. He was chill. Looked out the window and took a nap.
Aww the little stretch😍
my cat would be all up in everyone face and walking across keyboards meowing for food all day long
So cute
I’m going to explode.
Is it possible to die from cuteness overload?
Man where do people get all these nice cute cats mines a complete bitch. 
[deleted]
/r/tuckedinkitties wants to know your location
*Tries not to release inner cat lady*
I hate how this kitten is not a demon and is making me judge my little asshole. It's cute though. 
I kinda wish I could bring mine to work. We have an epic mouse problem.
Employee of the meow-nth.
I wish I was that kitten. It looks so comfy 
Let the kitty sleep man
IT'S SO CUTE IM GOING TO DIE
Oh yes please.

THAT TINY STRETCH. MY HEART.
Boss will be in awe for sure
That is how I am working
Sleeping on the job
Curious: Where does the kitty pee and poop at the office? did you bring the litterbox?
I wish this was my typical work day
That’s a neat workplace man, what do you do?
That's really cute, but... Why would you take a cat to work?
Awww how sweet , that stretch is adorable !
Oh my god 😭
Cute

AAAAAHHH PRECIOUS
Relaxation and Sleep Master - Level 100

After the new hype byod (bring your own device, smartphone)

The new hype: byoc (bring your own cat) 
Are you sure he didn't mean to say "Don't bring your car to work day".
OMG that little guy looks SOOOO mother fucking cozy
I love him
Yeeeeeeees-uhhhhhh. That’s an awesome boss. Probably the happiest day’s work anyone’s had there. (Hopefully those with allergies were warned and able to take precautions, though!)
Adorable! THAT is a happy cat! 
Lol
warm gai
So precious!! 😻
i just got my first apt on my own and i am very much looking forward to adopting a cat
Employee of the month, hands down! ❤❤❤❤
Live cat amongst the dead cats, as they call them
Too much cuteness, cant handle that!
But what if he needs to use the kitty-litter ?
Ok but... What about the "bring your dog to work" day? V;

**Pink** nose!
Aww bless. That kitty obviously has a peachy life.
"Just 5 more minutes..."
Don’t you have vacation?
Fuk you allergic people / Op and his boss
Aww sleepy lil fluff
I would be worried mine would fuck off 
r/wholesome 
So cute
Hey fuck you Jim and your cat allergy!
That deserves a mega Awwwwwww
If i were the boss and i am then i would also  inform my employees's  that are not neurotic socially inept hoarders that kitty cats appreciate free milk just as much as santa does the only difference being santa's milk comes from the grocery store in a carton but kitty cats milk comes from checker or auto zone in a plastic jug ho ho ho merry christmas 
That little stretch.
Kitty prefers to sleep in today.
I'm dying of cute
Damn it! You've made me want a kitten now.
Seems you have a new boss.
More of this please 
She knows what one should do in offices. 
Hey wake up. I need those files from the Hendricksom Branch
And the award for cutest stretch ever caught on camera goes to...
I aspire to one day be as comfy as this cat. 
That sweet babbyy
THAT LITTLE STRETCH SHASHHSBD
Soo human like. 
Now eat it.
Cat day, right?
Ur soo lucky! That must have been fun!
And those coworkers allergic to cats???
Those eyes!!
Adorable.
What's  a quiet seat.
Cute 💕💕💕
This broke me a little bit 
Awwwwww❤️
Cat is more finicky and pampered like a woman.  Sometimes she doesn't know what she wants.  She chooses not to listen to you and goes about her own business.  She's always on an emotional rollercoaster.  You can't walk a cat.  That's how I feel about cats.
I can kill myself now, too cute 
very cute!!
The cuteness! 
Cute little fucker.
Look at that tiny babe
I bet it's so warm in his little bundle :D
Everybody wants to be a cat. 
Omg what a bby
Cutest cat post I've seen. Heck, cutest post I've seen. You have an adorable cat!!
Turn off the sun human! Can't you see I'm sleeping here? 
😂
Heya T-Pain..are you watching this?
this is cute and all but excuse me is that fucking windows 7 ???
I thought the gray fur was a cat. Then I saw the other cat. So a cat within a cat. We heard you like cats...
5 more minutes mom....
nice one 
My kitten Luna would be fine in a new setting as long as I'm there and she has something familiar. But if she gets taken away from her older sibling, she doesn't like it. But her sibling angel hates anything unfamiliar. So if she went to work with me, she would freak out, and the kitten would freak with her lol
so cute
Just wanna find someone who looks at me like everyone does this cat
Wish I could bring mine to college to keep me calm
This is so cute lmao
On this day productivity hit all time lows
Little baby stretchums 💕💕💕💕
What kind of work still uses Windows 7?
Why is that kitten not sleeping on the keyboard, where it belongs?
r/catswithjobs would love this
Brb my heart just slipped! 🏃❤️
THE STRETCHHH AAAHH THATS CUTE.
Still doing more work than Jordan Schlansky apparently
Aaaaawww so cuuuute my heart has melted 
r/tuckedinkitties
“Working hard or hardly working, Frank!? Hurhurhurdur.”- every office dweeb. 
r/tuckedinkitties !!!!
Cutest video
I would be concerned that my cat would wander off exploring. He does come (more or less) when I call him, but he is a cat and it could take a while.
Beautiful hands 
Lmao why tf that cat is damn comfortable , i mean mine freaks out even when i touch him lol
I would be completely unproductive that day.
“Five more minutes...”
I wish I could bring my pet to work. But then again, I’m an OR nurse, so might not be the best idea.....
Oh, hello. I’m gonna go back to sleep now.
Upvoted for Windows xp 
Upvoted for old windows
Those paws
Jesus christ i cant, i just cant. 
This is the freakin CUTEST thing I have seen in a while. Thank you for this
Wake me when it's time to go home. 
Where’s the cat box?
With this headline I expected something funny or at least ironic... It's just a cat in a bag...
Ooooooh 🤗
Did you bring your own litter box?
Did he take a poll of everyone in the office first to make sure no one had severe cat allergies?
A
Don't let him watch Puss in boots movie or else you may have an angry cat swordsman running around your office. 
Antisocial humans aka Cat-owning Redditors tend to rub that off on their cats so yeah they don’t like strangers either 
666
So you woke him up? monster.
"One more minute"
Perfect
Every work place would be improved with pets around. Even dickheads don't want their pets to know they are terrible people.
The cat is not yours. You are its
I just squeaked when i saw it teeny, sleepy stretch... 
Omfg are you kitting me?? Super cute.
Awe 😻😻
Holly shit that is the cutest thing ever. Oh my God. 
Cute
I DON’T CARE WHAT YOUR BOSS SAID, THAT IS MY CAT AND IF YOU DON’T BRING BARON VON MITTENS BACK, SO HELP ME...
How dare she look through another woman's purrse
Sleeping on the job.  
You interrupted the lion’s deep slumber. Be prepared for your papers to be shreded
Such a teeny cutey. I have no other words rn
What a little doll! I hope you have many happy years with your kitty. 
Check with your Marketting dept. or Legal, but what is the name of this company?  Promoting this is great, but who?!??!
So I’m having a really shit day. Finished work to find out I’ve been in invited to my friends Christmas party (family is away). I saw this and it’s the only thing that has made me smile this afternoon. How beautiful xxx
While this cute, please leave your pet at home. A former colleague asked the employer if they could bring their cat into work, she did, no advanced notice and another employee became insanely allergic. When she was asked to take the cat home she refused stating it wasn't her cat that caused it and she was very dismissive about it. Boss even asked her to take the day and take the cat home she refused. 

The dude that got the allergic reaction sued the employer into the stone age. That's 33 people unemployed from a 50+ year old family business.


Boss says you can bring animals to work?
Fuck that. I see one cat in my office im off home. 

what is special here is u/sirmakoto's karma farming potential
My cat would've slapped the shit out of me and meowee if she were that comfortable and I disturbed her.
I’m not surprised you need kitteh cuddles after being forced to work with a PC! Life is much less stressful with a Mac.
It fell asleep at work, like a real american!
Windows 7

How can people work at companies that use Windows 😂
It would be funny if the fat guy at work accidentally sat in ur chair
