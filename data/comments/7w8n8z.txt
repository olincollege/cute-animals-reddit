Make sure you close your bedroom door when you go to sleep tonight. 
Nothing more ornery than an old cat. I had an old cat and she was extremely demanding. We were to cater too her every whim. If we tried to scold her she just looked at us like, "if you haven't hit me in almost two decades, you ain't going to start now". 

And she was right.

I'm 73 y.o. with severe arthritis, chronic pain.  When I'm having a really bad night Ziggy the Cat will bring me one of his toys, lay down on my hip and purr.  He is a good friend.

‚ÄúMonster! Hath though No SOUL yee furless grease puppet?!‚Äù 
Usually, my dog is terrified of my cats. But if I yell at one or push it off the table (where they don't belong), he whines and runs over to the cat, sniffing it and nosing at it, acting all concerned. It's pretty cute.
they're so pretty.  i don't see how you can stay mad at either of them for very long
You know they're plotting your murder as we speak, yeah?

I was trimming the claws on my ginger boy one night and he was being especially disagreeable. Our lil lady, that we adopted at the same time as him, ran over screaming and bit my hand to make me stop. So awesome how much they are able to care for each other. 
"There, there, I'll poop in the humans shoe later, will that make you feel better?"
No such thing as a naughty cat.  Only bad humans.  Give cats extra food tonight.

My cat is not watching over my shoulder demanding that I type this, I swear.
WELL I HOPE YOU'RE PROUD OF YOURSELF
You're like so fucked
"I thought you were better then that, I really did." 
When I was little, I remember my mother had this really old cat (Keko) from before I was born.  For my tenth birthday, we adopted a small kitten (Jupiter).  Keko would always act very protective of Jupiter, almost like a parental relationship.  If someone picked up Jupiter, Keko would come over and anxiously make sure we weren't hurting her.  If someone gave treats to Keko, she would push some off to the side for Jupiter.  Your picture made me think of them!

Aw don't sleep with her at night you might get scratched up
On the plus side, your cats are adorable! 
Apologize or it will only get worse.
Shouting at your cat is only slightly less futile than getting involved in a land war in Asia. 
üòû don't yell at the cats, man.
You monster.
Haha aw I wasn‚Äôt expecting this kind of loyalty. Nice kitty.
Aww you meanie.
We just got a kitten and I'm so scared to punish her so I've been using my ABA tactics of redirecting her to other things when she misbehaves or my boyfriend recommended to have her fix whatever she messes up. For example, she dropped some food on the floor and instead of picking it up for her or getting upset we brought her over to it to prompt her to eat it which she did üòä
‚Äúgo away, you‚Äôve done enough‚Äù 
Why would you shout at your cat
Is there anybody you'd like me to call? The cat mafia won't let this affront go. 
"I hope you're pleased with yourself human..."
Someone's getting their windshield shit on tonight
"Apologize."
There is nothing more soul crushing than the disdainful judgement you see in you're cats eyes if you ever piss them off. 
"Don't talk to me or my son ever again"
‚ÄúHow dare you shout at us you peasant!‚Äù
"You shouldn't a'done that. He's just a boy." 
This is what you get for being a monster. Now bring both of them cat nip..now.
You will hear from HR...
"Look what you've done."
Take cute picture.   
Make up a good story behind the picture.   
Profit!! 
Much like elephants, cats never forget.  My brother yelled at my cat once and my cat still hates him, and this is a cat that hates water but jumps in the shower with me everyday just so he can be close to me.  Good luck sleeping tonight.  I can totally picture it doing extra laps around your bedroom at 3 am just to piss you off.
That is precious! ! Yep, they communicate well. 
OMG!  My kitty looked just like these guys.  Nicest, sweetest creature.  She even put up with toddler bullshit.  Never swatted or bit anyone in the 4 years I had her.

That beautiful coat seemed to come with a lot of genetic issues though...bad teeth, IBS, kidney disease, and finally cancer.  Poor kitty.

You are a godsdamned monster.
My big ass tabby has became so salty, it's almost adorable. You try and move him so you can set down and he goes app shit.
You evil cold hearted human. You don't understand cats! How could you. . . 
"You are bad human. Look at she now, she is crying"
The judgment is strong with these two.
and you should be ashamed!  maybe you can make it up to her over the days and months...  fresh fish in her little dish...  long grooming sessions...  *talking softly and with few words*

maybe...
You deserve that laser glare! You hurt the poor little kitties feelings! She is going to remember that for 7 minutes! But she will remember the naughty thing for life and keep doing it!
My girlfriend can‚Äôt bring herself to ever scold our cat. The farthest she will go is say ‚Äúyou weren‚Äôt bad...but you weren‚Äôt good.
You monster. 
I don‚Äôt believe this story.

Don't ever shout at us again, puny human!!
God, I‚Äôm a dog person, but this is converting material right here.
Watch your back tonight.
aw my cat looks just like yours and has an appointment to get spayed tomorrow so right now she's being denied food and no water after midnight and I feel so bad.

But I already have 5 cats so I dont need kittens. I want more kittens. I want all kittens. But its not feasible.
"Jesus, Carol, you could have just been a bit less abrasive.  Now look what you've done."
Our cat wants food 24/7 & when he isn't stuffing his face, he likes cuddle. I feed him breakfast & dinner at pretty much the same times every day, but during the day he likes to whine & put on an  "I'm dying! I'm wasting away!" show lol. Love him to pieces though. 
welp you've done it. the cats are gonna start taking over now.
I used to have three cats.  If I told one of them off, the youngest one would also tell them off with a few swipes to thier head.  She was a smug little thing.   
My cat sometimes pukes in the worse possible locations and I just get so mad at her.  But an hour later she's purring and cuddling with me.  It's hard to get mad at them for very long haha. 
That's not at all what's going on in this picture but good work getting the karma
"Are you satisfied now?"

*You asshole, look at what you did!*
You shouldn‚Äôt a did that. He‚Äôs reel sad meow. 
Still naughty.  Just a slice of cute to go with it.
My cats do this shit to each other *all the time*. My Siamese is an absolute monster, and meows every time he gets scolded. My little tabby cat who is half his size runs to his rescue, cuddles him, and looks as if she is saying *‚Äùshame on you!‚Äù* with her eyes. 
Other Cat ‚Äù What did you say to her?‚Äù 
You. ‚ÄúWell I told her to sto‚Äî‚Äú
Other Cat  ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt yell at the cats!  Only the dogs!‚Äù
My cat isn't used to sleeping in the same room as me. When I fall asleep he will often think I am dead and freak out, meowing in my face until I wake up. He will then purr and go back to whatever he was doing in my room. It's annoying but sweet that he cares I guess. 
Becareful man, you don't know, who are you messing with.
Cats don't understand punishment, it just makes them anxious. There are a lot of positive ways to handle any situation. Read any Jackson Galaxy and your viewpoints will forever be changed

You monster.

/r/catsraisedbynarcissists.
Really, it was just a coincidence that you found them like this. They didn't really have any feelings about you shouting at them.
You did a really, really, really bad thing! Once your cats decide you are no longer part of their group there is no getting back into their group. They are going to ghost you for the next 12-19 years. Sure they will pretend you are part of their group but let's see if you get invited to their 2019 New Year's party.
It is possible that cats do not respond to negative-feedback training at all, but it is almost certain that they don't respond to negative feedback training unless it is instantaneous, or nearly-instantaneous (like, within a second). 

Human children (even very young ones) have faculties of memory and association that are uniquely human. Domesticated dogs are different, but are far more socialized to humanity. 

Dogs can be trained to have a sense of pseudo "guilt", not that they rummaged through trash, but rather about trash being on the floor. If you keep a clean home, the dog can learn that you will be upset is there if trash on the floor. It's not that they have a conscience that tells them they were bad for digging through the trash, it's that they associate messy floors with an unhappy family, and they want to avoid that. When a dog hides in the corner and looks (to us) ashamed, it's not that they think they were bad, it's that they know you're angry and are trying to avoid that anger. It's maybe a kind of proto-conscience, an instinct to be around happiness and to avoid unhappiness.

Cats do not have anywhere close to that level of interspecies empathy/reason. They have not been domesticated nearly as long as dogs, and are not pack animals besides, so they don't have anywhere near that level of socialization. 

When you express anger at a cat, she does not associate your anger with any external realities (i.e., the spilled vase she knocked over), she just sees a hostile animal. You may as well be a shark who sometimes gives her food, and sometimes tries to bite her leg off. The best way to train a cat is with instantaneous positive feedback and environmental cues. 

Dogs are social animals. They feel safe and secure around their pack (that's you) and around "friends" (other dogs, people, and animals they know). They are also roaming hunters. So they learn their cues from who they are with. 

Cats are more solitary, and much more territorial creatures. This is why cats freak out so much more than dogs about car trips or the vet or whatever. Dog associates your presence with safety, so wherever you go, the dog is happy to go, and whoever you introduce the dog to, the dog is happy to meet. New places and faces are fun and exciting, so long as you are there with doggo. 

Cat does NOT trust you. Cat trusts her own territory, that she has marked and inspected and cleared of enemies. When you take her to a place of strange smells and sounds and different shadows, you are part of the danger. When she starts clawing at the strange person trying to pull her from her carrier and you start shooting her with water or some shit, you are one of the enemies, one of the dangers of this terrible new place: even the food-dispenser has turned against me, better claw her eyes out. 

You can't train cats as though they are dogs, and you definitely cannot train them as through they are children. 
My experience with cats makes me wonder whether they process the idea which we have that they have been 'naughty' - yes, they will run away if shouted at, but will repeat the 'naughty' act if they feel like it. Comforting one another if they are friends happens, I suspect, mainly because they like doing it; mutual grooming as a bond. I even find my cat will insist on licking my hand if I've been stroking him while on my lap; after a bit he will transfer the tongue to his on paw and continue washing himself.
[deleted]
They're gonna put catnip in your coffee later.
Does shouting at your kitty work? We just took in a stray but sometimes he acts out.  Like just last night he was begging for food, and when we tried to shoo him away, he swatted and scratched us.  Not sure what I should be doing in that situation.
I know that look. Who knew being a cat owner carried so much judgement and guilt. 
Omg that's my cats twin!
Lolol
One of them turned into a cinnabun!
WHAT DID YOU DO?!
Stop being a Cat!

Beautiful tabby cats! I have two too!
They will just eat you, eyeballs first, if you die around them. 
These look exactly like my cats üò≤
You really should watch your back over the next couple days. I've seen that look before
Get out while you can, they're plotting on you now
Aww they are so adorable. And beautiful. They look very similar to my cat. Do you know what breed they are? 
‚ÄúHold me Clyde, the Hooman is mean‚Äù
They look a lot like one of mine (I have two sisters; one's solid black and Ruby looks like your cats.) My question here is are your cats unbelievably soft? Because my cat that looks like yours is the softest cat I've ever pet (as soft as my black cat, Salem.) I actually had a vet tell me they were the softest cats they've ever had in the office. Lol

That's the problem with cats, they want to be treated like a princess.
Mama kitty don't take no sass.
 I've always wanted a sweet cat, they're a lot more stoic than dogs, I love my pups though 
That's a face posing two questions at the same time:

* "What do you want?"

Holy crap. Really thought someone else posted my cats. Same coat/face. 
What victims of emotional abuse looks like
Just have to say the cat looking at the camera looks exactly like if you combined both of my cats. 
I like their colors! üòª
When we walk our pupper around the block our cat loves to tag along. She follows the dog not us the humans, but the cat walks without a leash which makes it a pain to keep her from running in the street. If its dark and we just don't feel like keeping up with kitty, we put her in the house. Every time without fail she takes a shit on the dinning room floor. Cats very spiteful sometimes. 
This spoils the child. 
Haven't you done enough harm OP
Those are beautiful cats !
She doesnt want to talk to you right meow Sharon
Whenever I shout at the new kitten, one of my two older cats always runs off to get his side of the story. 
You dead bro
When I yelled at mine, she shit in my bed. No lie! I had to close my bedroom door all the time after that. Had a roommate. I told him to keep his bedroom door shut. He didn't. She must have been mad at him, she shit in his bed, too. 
ishe looks like she's gonna eat your soul 
Bad hooman 
"Look what you did."
It's never the animals' fault.

That's adorable. My cats are the opposite. The youngest is definitely "my cat" while the oldest loves my husband more. I've noticed that when I fuss at the oldest, the youngest one will go and smack him with her paw as if to make sure he understands he's in trouble.
That's a judgemental stare!
The anthropomorphism is real in this sub.

There is no such thing as a bad cat. Cats just are cats.

Literally, it looks like you stole our cat lol. He's sitting right next to me too
You ASSHOLE!!
"Oh, yeah. I am SO gonna poop in your shoes for this!"
When Applesauce the cat gets hollered at for eating carpet fuzz...he pouts in the dirty laundry basket. You cant win. 
Oh wow I didn't know you got that new eyeball camera implant.

Ha ha this is funny, my cats do this too.  You monster you. /s
Today, at 5 am, my kitten ran into a fly strip, panicked, and bolted around the house, becoming more and more entangled. We had to catch her and pull it off and now she has grass and sand stuck to the glue. It's very gross. Just saying.
It‚Äôs funny to think about how cats were raised, like dogs were brought up from wolves alongside humans to help us hunt and we would reward them with food and shelter. So they love to please naturally

But cats were brought up to be thought of as gods, I wonder if that rewired their ancestral brains to continually feel holier than thou
Reminds me of my dog when she was alive
Ah, fuck.
Did you apologize?
i don‚Äôt think so. 
"You are a terrible human being. Never speak to me or my friend again... EVER!!" - the cat

Had to make sure these weren't my cats real quick
My cat has the same pattern!
Totally plotting your death and which part they'll eat first.
"Are you proud of yourself, hooman? Look what you have done."
Can I borrow your cat? I need him/her to glare at my boss for yelling at me today
Damn, that's funny!!
They have that "revenge hairball in the bed" expression that cats get 
You are so mean

cats should never be yelled at.. all they want is fun and what comes natural to them .. they dont know better
I'm getting a weird Sense of Deja Vu with this post, like even the top comment. 
Is shouting really effective?  I always had unlimited success with fiercely hissing at them when they did wrong

Catspeak or not, they knew they'd fucked up when they were hissed at 
I want to stick my face in the middle and give them both cuddles 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt talk to me or my son ever again‚Äù
I need a hug 

"Don't talk to me or my son ever again"
I mean, when isn't a cat glaring at you?
I rule my house with an iron fist when it comes to my cats.  They walk all over my wife but when Dad gets up it means business.  If they're doing something wrong and they hear me getting up...they scatter.  But they're not scared of me.  As a matter of fact all 3 absolutely love me and never leave me alone despite my wife being the coddler.  
So you happen to have your camera out and ready? I call bs
When my cats are naughty I call them farts and tell them that nobody likes to be around farts. Not really effective but it makes me feel better.
YOU DON'T DESERVE THEM
Cats do not like raised voices.

100th comment woot
I never yell at my cats in anger. They are cats. You love them and you get love back. 
why would you yell at your cat? ok to get frustrated/annoyed but cmon, it's a cat. they're lovable furry idiots, and yelling at them accomplishes nothing.
What did you do?!?!
No you didn't.
Or none of that happened and cat people are crazy and delusional, yeah I will go with that.
Proof: they 100% understand human 
Woah, that looks like my cat, anyone know what kind of cat that is?
I hate cats and this made me upset.
Very cute, but I don't buy your interpretation. Cats know neither guilt nor shame and thus don't require comforting.
Women 
Dogs>Cats
Yeah, it's super r/aww to hear about how you're abusing an innocent animal.
That owner is an asshole for losing their temper.  Just my opinion 
Fuck that cat.
I never yell at my cat. You shouldn't have cats I reckon if you're the yelling type.
