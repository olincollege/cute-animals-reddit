Me: Can a cat still be brave if it's afraid?

This cat: That is the only time a cat can be brave.
And look how calm she is as well.
My cat pleaded to go out on the porch when there was a hurricane outside. She loves watching rain, just hates getting her body wet- paws are fine
It's the end of the world   
as we know it,   
And I feline.
This kitty has definitely seen some shit.
I will not give in to fear. Fear is the mind killer.
Poor baby - give her a hug! 

If she’ll let you that is...
My kitty shouts at me when it's raining. He wants to go out but doesn't want to get wet and it's my fault it's raining of course.
This is basically Totoro's reaction under the umbrella.
I'd be under my bed, clutching a bottle of Jack and crying.   

I got PTSD from being struck by lightning, so there.
r/NamFlashbacks
This is fine.
Geeze. My cat hides behind the toilet when it rains.  This cat is a beast
If i’z lay here perfectly still the bad sounds can’t find me.
I love his body colors
Ours looks the same when we finally find out were he has gone to hide

Such stoic!
That cats eyes say it all. When my cat does this, he’s about to freak out.
The terror is real. Now my sissy gotta show through. I hope you got the cat into a more comfortable place after the video.

That's some next level PTSD

Holy shit this got me. Good post op

The nam flashbacks they are flooding in
If you ever want to see a happy cat - thats not it

This is my dog’s internal dialogue right now 😂

This weather resembles the weather in PA.
That cat has seen some shit.
Did he just have covid jab?
That's a thousand yard stare if I ever saw one.
Rain + thunder + lightening + *the sharpest ear ever created* = **APOCALYPSE**
Dude looks lost in the sauce.
Where did they find a video if me
Sen...sory...over...load.
That's a funny looking owl
Like a bad acid trip. Best thing to do is to just sit still and let the storm pass.
He feels fine.
Born without eyelids.

Stand your ground. You got this
IT needs a hug
"It's raining mes and dogs out there!"
Bravery really is just Fear in a mask
Some people just deal with everything better.
Cute and funny🤣
This is so funny! 🤣
That’s some fighting spirit, I’m not sure I would’ve been able to do the same 😦
I had to sing to my girl while she experienced her first storma
Impressive

I don’t know… kinda lookin like a scaredy-cat.
Hilarious. Its face says it all.

Those are some PTSD eyes!
He's having some other-worldly flashbacks
Missing some darksouls music :p
* loafs nervously \*
My dog hates duck hunting season, fireworks, thunderstorms, and having the old baby gate tip over on her when not in use. 

Which is how I came to be wearing a 100lb mastiff like a scarf at 130am. Because the thunderstorm and knocking over the gate things happened and her nerves were just too frayed. When I got her off me and the light on, that's what she looked like.
Omg comfort this beautiful creature
Maaaaa!!!
When it rains, my cat cones to me and complains bitterly and angry about why I don't turn that horrendous water off.
She looks scared shitless
Vietnam flashbacks
That cat is all of us at the beginning of the quarantine 4real
Lol my cat hates bad weather as well- climbs on top of my fridge and stars meowing for it to stop. Your cat handling pretty well tho.

The intro to One by Metallica is playing in that cat’s head
My dog would be under the bed, shaking like a leaf, and panting so much she would sound like a steam engine
"This is fine...."
"This is it. it's happening"
My cat hides under my pillow when it rains. She was feral the first two years of her life and I think she has ptsd from rainstorms.
I have panic attacks like this.
Kitty's face looks like a sugar bear
That cat looks like she’s seen some shit.
What a day I had with my fur baby. Time for vaccinations . OMG what a battle. He broke out of his carrier. He went nuts.😼😾🙀
The look of pure terror.
one of my cats hides her in enclosed litter box and I HATE it, but she’s already scared so I feel bad trying to redirect her. I’ve made her alternative hiding spots she sometimes uses. but sadly depending on where she is in my apartment when the noise happens she just heads straight for the litter box.
I want rain. It’s too hot and my dog and I really love rain. I want rain.
THERE ARE SOUNDS. SOUNDS THAT I DO NOT LIKE.
handling the collapse better than some

Oooooh sweet baby! My pupper hides in the bathtub when there is any storms or fireworks! I feel this on a personal level
I understand cat
Poor thing
Oh my god, what a cute, brave kitty. His eyes look like he's having war flashbacks but he's braving it out.
🤣🤣🤣🤣if I ever saw terror....😍
Hooooooolllddd!   Hooooollllllddddd!!!
My dog whenever we go through a car wash...
Aww, poor kitty facing the end of the world all by herself. ❤️
Poor baby
Lemur face
This is a brave cat. As soon as the first drops of rain start my cat is looking for the nearest closet to hide in.
My cat just ignores the rain and thunder storms and generally she is a very very skittish cat so I always wonder why doesn’t rain scare her?

Omg this is totally a meme format in the making.

Kitty remembers the crimes she committed in Yugoslavia
Poor kitty...I know the feeling. I had a crippling fear of bad weather growing up, and two older siblings who thought it was funnier than Monty Python so they triggered it for a cheap laugh every chance they got. I had to wait until they left for college before I could get it under control.
Not my cat

The cat: O_O
Ah 😫 it also rained very heavily  here lastnight and we could hear a kitten crying. (Someone had to have dropped it off because  we live on a dead end, know all the neighbors and know they don't have any kittens)

I was out in the rain for 20 minutes trying to get this kitten to come out from under a truck but it was way to scared. Plus my other cats came to see what the fuss was about and that just scared the kitten more. 

All day I've been stepping outside trying to call for it but so far havnt heard or seen it since last night.
So brave ...
The face…”THIS IS IT!”
Cat: “just what in the world is going on outside?!” And “why the hell are you filming me instead of running for shelter? “
Love the storm.  Wish we had them here.
Everything’s fine
😹
This is the best title ever
I could watch this for hours.
Stop filming start cuddling!

That is not a happy kitty, she just isn't showing much yet.

.....buffering
i love this omg
We all are, technically
My newest cat (got about a year ago) is a dog trapped inside a cat's body. She "barks" at everything outside (I had never heard a cat bark), is scared shitless of thunder (my other cat loves watching storms), has to constantly be touching people (even strangers), and makes so much noise it is insane. Whenever someone comes over they think she is the most ignored cat who is starving from her constant meowing and whining... she just wants your nonstop attention.
Ah, that's actually me every time I try mushrooms knowing that I've not had that fun/trippy/deep experience others seem to have.
Nice
How inspirational.
“blink motherfucker!”
Poor! Baby!
My boys would be straight under the bed
Cats been to Nam
Over July 4th and recent storms I learned our new kittens don't fear anything outside of the house. Mortars 300 ft away? No problem. Thunder cracking so loud the house shakes? Sleeping like babies. Drop a fork on the kitchen floor? It's like a cartoon with their feet spinning as they try to run and hide.
"I am the abyss"
The poor little puddin'! There's a kitty that needs an in bed cuddle
That cat has seen some things…
Glass ceiling? Some rain water must be seeping through the seal.
That’s what you call relaxation
"Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,
I fear no harm,
For you are with me" --- Cat
Is that the ceiling of your bedroom? So cool
Bravely? Petrified is closer.
Probably messed itself
just wait until the market crashes
Aw the poor thing doesn’t know what to do XD
I need to be brave like this cat
Tears... in the rain
"Hey ma, come look at this F'n cat"
friendly cat
“Come for Me, Gmork! I Am Atreyu!”
I wish it was raining.
BLINK, MOTHERFUCKER!
**I AM PERFECTLY CALM! **
Poor thing is terrified.
Cat does a concern
Please move the cat away from the glass ceiling during the storm. They are terrified. Not cute.

Mine just burrows underneath the covers when it storms like this. This cat is the hold the line cat.

My cats don’t give a shit what the weather is outside.

Now my dog, on the other hand….
"Hold it together Fluffy!  You've been an atheist for 4 years, now is not the time to crumble and start praying to Meowsus."
Great job facing those fears, beautiful baby. 😍 Kitty looked freaked though 🤣
Our dearly departed Converse knew when storms were coming. She absolutely hated them and would low crawl to what safety she could find. Our term for her was “Low Cat”.
Pretty sure she's logged out
It all returns to nothing, it all comes tumbling down, tumbling down, tumbling down

This katnip is hitting different
this is how my anxiety feels...
Poor thing is catatonic
Reminds me of Totoro
Out of curiosity are you in kentucky because we've been getting on and off heavy rain like that for the past month
Someone please comfort that brave kitty!
poor lil bastard will have PTSD.

A few booms and 5 minutes of rain today. Has him in hiding.
I dunno about "bravely". LOL
Ichigo... do you know how I hate rain? And it rains in this world, too. If your heart is troubled, the skies will become cloudy. If you grieve, it will rain ever so easily. [pause] I wonder if you can understand... the fear of being rained on in this lonely world... To stop that rain, I shall lend you any strength, any power. If you just have faith in me, I will not allow any rain to fall upon this world. [speaking out loud] Trust me, Ichigo. As long as I am here, you'll never fight alone.
Scared so much the cat became an owl.

Poor thing!!! What a brave cat! Hope it got some cuddles.
So very brave!
The cat is burdened with realization that it will face   judgement for its many sins.
This cat has seen the end of worlds before. That's how it lost some of it's previous lives.
This post ( [It came out of nowhere. Scared the cat when it started](https://www.reddit.com/r/raining/comments/okvfz3/it_came_out_of_no_where_scared_the_cat_when_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) ) came right before OP’s video of their scared cat on my feed.

We all have the same cat tree. I've seen/ heard of fancy ones made of real wood but I can't imagine how much that must cost.  Quick.  Someone invent/sell a mid-range Toyota of the cat tree world.
That's so much braver than my scaredy cats. They growl and trot off upstairs whenever they hear a car door close outside. They practically fall all over themselves running from thunder.
Gary?! Are you okay Gary?
put the phone/camera down and hold the kitty!
the end is nigh, there is no escape.  The thunder shall destroy us all.

Me on a Sunday evening
Genuinely shocked that it's not hiding under a chair or bed. I know that's what my cat does whenever she hears thunder.
In his head he just started cat religion. He will doom us all.
The cat is braver than I
He looks like he’s seen a ghost
Hahahah

Paly some "kitty copter" with it.  It won't be scared of rain anymore!

We've had thunder storms for the last few days.  I think my cat feels that the world ended, and the afterlife is even worse!
Thunderstorms always remind me of this song:

Looking so nice. I love this pet.
I Would have had to scoop that baby up and hug it until the storm blew over.
Try catnip they said, itll be fun they said
