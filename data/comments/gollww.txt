Is this heaven?

Edit: thanks to the kind stranger for the award.
Those can be pretty savage. A friend of mine got surrounded and bullied by a bunch of them
Japan is just something else man. Weird mix of technology and nature.
Hidan really be in that park doe 😳😳
My wife and I went to Japan for our honeymoon. We loved it so much we were back in less than a year. We planned on going every year until this virus happened. I'm afraid itll be awhile before we get to go back.

Now I know why the Nara clan is so good with deers
Man... these deers are not aww material. Went there once and they are pretty aggressive to visitors, especially if you have the food on your hands. Be ready for bumps, lotsa them.
This is some serious anime shit.
Oh wow! That’s amazing... Looks like a fairy tale.
Annoying fucks, had no crackers but still got bitten in the ass twice.

This is real I went to Nara Park last summer, these deer really do get this close.
You do not want to be in possession of an entire stack of crackers when they are around, I got mobbed by a bunch of deer and had to drop crackers to stall them to get away and hide the rest in my bag.

Just pull out one or two crackers at a time
Hallelujah, Bovay, Alabama. To be a deer in Nara
I wish I was a deer
Beautiful, I'm quite fawn of this.
this is amazing wow
Thanks for sharing this. It’s beautiful 😍
Damn satori mountain lookin hella lit
Okay couple questions... Is this heaven? And if so why come no one told me God is a deer?
Those deer are so fucking annoying.  Nara is beautiful, but they are basically giant human-fed squirrels.  Obviously this is the humans' fault, but still, it definitely diminishes the experience.
I think I've been there before! But it is very nice and very helpful to have the same thing about you as a friend of yours that you can share
Good vibes all!
So peaceful
This is the definition of what peaceful looks like.
Someone Wallpaper Engine the part of them in the pink forest!
wow i didn't know canela moved to japan
Twitch admins in the wild
Bruh why you do this? I was suppose to be there 2 weeks ago 😭😭😭
i went here during a trip to japan and some of the deers ganged up on me and stole and ice cream cone out of my hand and ripped open a plastic bag i was holding lol
this is the most gorgeous thing I've seen in a while what the fuck
It looks good on video but imagine how much more beautiful it is in person. I’d be like “am I..am I finally dead and in Heaven??”
If you make it past the entrance with your deer cookies and ass in one piece the nice deer will gladly bow for a treat. I have a video somewhere of my wife getting swarmed.
This just looks to good to be true 😍😍
That is gorgeous. No other way to put it.
You can tell this is in Nara because of the Deer in the park. Nara is known for their wild deer if you didn’t know
I had a great time visiting them in Nara.  They love those cookies.  If you hold up a cookie they will bow their heads asking for it.  So peaceful there.
At this point I'm convinced Japan isn't real.
Dude. Look at all that food. Someone get me a damn bow.
i want to die here
It’s all fun and games until you bring out food and they rush you like a kid wanting to know if you have games on your phone
Deer heaven
I had a bruise for the rest of our two week vacation.
That's a whole lot of back straps. Maybe the Japanese should eat more venison and stop over harvesting the ocean. I know there not the only ones. I'm just pointing out that there is slot of good food going to waste.

I'm supposed to be there right now :((((( 8 months of planning down the drain.

Oh Deer PepeLaugh
The beginning looks like an area in world of warcraft right before I slaughtered everything in sight because I need 15 deer skin for an NPC hahahaha
F those deer... Lol. I told my friend to be careful when feeding them and I started to film him as a second approached from the back. It just grabbed his scarf and pulled it choking him and he almost fell being pulled back. I was not expecting that. I really thought it was gonna wait or bow and bam! 'Gimme MY FOOD!' My friend was turned around, not being much of an aggressive person, began to point at it and lecture it that it was not getting any. They're good for the pics but they crave those sweet addictive crackers like a bunch of hopped up addicts. 

Although, lesson learned, if you hold back or put your hand out to back them away or stop, they will. If you bow, they'll copy because they've been train by so many tourist to do the same for their snacks. Also, if you go in more, there's a bit more and I think they're more calm because that's where they go to getting away. Everyone feeds them in the front/beginning area.
Rats with hooves!

DISCLAIMER: Where I'm from deer are a nuisance animal only good for destroying your lawn, your car (and possibly you with the car) and being covered in ticks

RATS. WITH. HOOVES.
I hate you, i can’t go to japan, now I’m not going out cause the quarantine, so i want to travel.
You’re a bad persone. 😢😤

Beautiful.
Wow Nara was awesome but I need to go back for the blossoms. Amazing isn’t an overstatement
The new Disney movie looks amazing.
Ok, this is surreal beauty 😍
When I went there, I was immediately surrounded by deer because I was holding biscuits. They started bumping me to try to get the biscuits. It was terrifying.
Beudiful buedisnes
It’s like a Dreamland!
They are surprisingly clean and healthy for wild animals
That shedding fur looks like it itches like crazy.
I apologize... why were the first things to pop in my head:  
1) oh, how nice... wow...  
2) it's coming right for us!
Another saved post
Wow the new animal crossing looks great
This is what heaven looks like
I loved feeding the deer in Nara, easy train ride from Osaka if you find yourself out that way.
Awasome !
Why arent they swarming around you for food?
I want to go back so bad ;\_;
These deers are jerks, they kept biting me until i gave them all the biscuits. They kept pulling my jacket until I showed them my empty hands.
Absolutely enchanting.
One of two locations (afaik) where visitors are mixed in with friendly(-ish) deer. The other location is Miyajima island. Equally touristy, but more beautiful overall to my eyes.
that looks so surreal, like some fairytale world
Ohhh this one's gonna be popular
They cute and all, but watch out for those sharp teefth ..they bite
Don’t be fooled. Those deer in Nara Park are fierce animals.
Ugh! My heart just melted?!?!
Man, some of these deer could use a good brushing. I just wanna get into that park with a big ol brush and hold a deer spa day

This is exactly how I perceive rural Japan
Ha! Snout blossoms.
Glad to see Bambi's mom is fine
My nose already hates this place
This is so relaxing to watch.
Man this is some deer paradise shit.
this is so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing to the eyes imo
Those deer are sneaky! I bought some of the cooked sweet potatoes from a vendor and was carrying the paper bag of sweet potatoes in one hand while trying to hand feed a deer with a sweet potato in the other. Unseen, one deer came up behind me, ripped the paper bag open, spilling out the contents, and a swarm of deer descended upon me to eat all of them on the ground. Clever girl.
Those deer look raggedy as fuck lol

They are all so cute. I wish I was able to visit Nara Park. I would love to feed those deer.

Wait what the frickity frack? This is real? So does that mean the hidden leaf is nearby?
They look cute until you buy a stack of those wafers, then they are all over you.  Nibbling your pants, butting your legs.  Eh, even then they're still cute.
Even though they are really cute they can be pretty aggressive -- when I was there one of the deers grabbed and ate my paper map of the park when I wasn't looking lol
Those deer are so smol! I want to hug one!
^kiss ^kiss ^fall ^in ^love
Ah, so this is what heaven looks like.
Anyone that goes there best to ready to suplex one of those deer if you have any food in your hands.
Nara deer are cute, but they can also get bitey if you aren’t quick enough with the deer biscuits.

Once saw them swarm a girl in a wheelchair after her classmates dumped a bunch of biscuits on her lap.
I go on my alt account to look at porn, and I get this shit. Thank you.
I love blossom trees.

Somewhere under the blossoms Shikamaru is sleeping.
Looks like a world of Warcraft zone
So beautiful
You can tell deer were created by the universe for one purpose.  Eating.  Kind of like cows.   No awareness, just instinct.  Like a tree with meat.
This is a fairy tale and Narnia and a dream all in one picture.
Just. Let. Me. Pet. One 

I need serotonin
They will mug you for those crackers.
This is just sooooo lovely.
Holy crap, that’s beautiful!
I feel bad for the deer in Nara right now. They are really reliant on humans for food. 🥺
Don‘t underestimate those Monsters! They might look cute, but if they see you with food they‘ll rip you apart!
It looks like they know there aren't any predators around so they can relax a bit.

Super cute until they bite you on the ass for not feeding them fast enough. Then it is just painfully cute.

They look cute and everything, but i can tell you from experience these deer are intimidating and pushy af. Literally mob you for crackers. One bit my boyfriends butt. Would 100% go back though
Take your Girlfriend there if you want to keep her forever.
Those bastards are a gang!!! If you don't give them food, they will attack you
I would die to be here.
I loved Nara so much. We walked the trail through the primeval forest from the park. I highly recommend it.
Looks like those guys got the COVID lockdown haircut, too.
Nara park is such a nice visit. I'd go back there again for the park and the nice people.

My hotel had a **Jazz button**... so there's that.
The deer are probably wondering why there are less people to give them snacks. They are probably really lonely. Sad deer is sad.
Why are deers so beautiful 😍

Sakura only blooms in Japan, right?
Nice
It’s like pink snow!
Nara has to be one of the most amazing cities I've ever been to.

My favorite memory of Nara was when my dad was posing for a picture with one of the deer, and it suddenly reached out for the park map in my dad's hand, probably thinking it was food. My dad tried to take it back from the deer, but its grip was too tight and it ate the map.
Oh my god I NEED to be there!!
Feeding the deer in Nara during cherry blossom season last year was the absolute highlight of my trip to Japan. The tourists in the area have trained them to bow politely to ask people for a cookie, so it was really cute.
Welcome to Hanamura agents
I was gonna say this is my spirit animal, but like, the location version of that. This is my spirit place. Guess I'm moving to Nara, bye guys
I’ve been there! They sold crackers, and if you raised them above the deer’s head, they would bow down to you!
Is this what heaven looks like?
Enough to make Cripps screw off while doing collector role!
So weird that something so beautiful could exist in such a fascist nation.
This is magical and beautiful and tranquil and I love it.

...also, cherries are a really good accompaniment to venison, so it appeals to me a from a "one-stop-shopping" perspective too.
I was supposed to be on a trip to Japan this month :-/
True,but currently Japan is a better one
How did you get that close without scaering them?
I loved Nara! They actually bow to receive these treats. There’s folklore saying those deer are sacred and are meant to protect the temple. I believe these particular type of deer have been there for a very long time.
To be a deer in Nara
I've still got bites on my ass and legs from these motherfuckers.
Honestly frolicking naked through this sounds heavenly
This is definitely heaven
Wow this is nice, dont show this to humans they will fuck it right up
This is why japan is so fucking awesome
Imagine the ticks there.
Don’t feed them!!!
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
I’d bloody all that right up 🥩
Oh so this is where shikamaru buried hidan.
I miss Nara and those deers ❤️
Japan, being dotted albumin, has a very fertile soil, so it is varied from the animal and plant sides
I have been here. Such a magical place. You can buy crackers to feed the deer, and they surround you and eat the crackers right out of your hand. So much different than the deer in the US that run away from you.
how is this even real place?! such a beautiful scenery!
Can cherry blossoms grow in America? Where could I find a seed to plant one?
I love Sakura trees
This is all so goddamn beautiful!!!
I loved Nara when we visited Japan. Probably my favorite place ever.
Did that deer just eat a poppadom?
Well, I finally found the location that I want my ashes sprinkled after I die!
I remember standing at a crosswalk with a group of deer waiting for the light to change. Really a unique place!
Wait till tourists end up destroying this place from taking pictures (I really hope not)
I miss Nara :(((( I loved petting the deer and being able to go to that stunningly beautiful temple, I wish I could’ve seen it with the blossoms
Those deers are fat
So sad I missed this, we had planned on going this year and it was perfectly timed as well
Do Nara Deer have any natural predators??
First 10 seconds should be a screen saver

I really like how calm the deer are in Japan....tranquil to watch with the cherry blossoms.
God I am so much less graceful watching this in my penguin pajamas and my hair in a messy bun. How come my “nature” isn’t this good? Hahahaha
That's beautiful. Now can someone upvote this. I need 10 karma or w.e so I can start posting on Reddit.

Ha! Nara means deer... Way to go Shikamaru
Is nobody going to point out that these deer are likely starving right now since we've taught them to rely on tourists to feed them?

why do they look like they tried to shave them but messed it up >.>

This is what is nice about Japan
We were going to visit this park for our honeymoon in March, but had to reschedule. Stupid covid!
Not done with you yet. Love the pic btw. Reddit has a reckoning
Oh deer.

&#x200B;

It's actually funny. We have a cherry blossom tree in our back yard (it's bare now), and when we didn't have mini-mansions all around us, we occasionally had deer pass through our back yard. We never went out to give them stuff because the moment we slid the back door open they'd bolt back into the woods.
The council sends it's regards.
r/natureisfuckinglit
I wonder what the parks carrying capacity is. Does the government sterilize the deer the keep the population in check?
They’re cute and all until they start stalking and harassing you lmao...first hand experience
Yo, this is amazingly serene! 😖😖😖
That town is covered in deer feces and stinks like hell in summer.
Well fed deer!
It's not just beautiful, its Majestic
Nara Park is truly my happy place.
It doesn't look real. Wonderful.
All was peacefully until the deer crackers were shown🙆‍♂️
Can someone make an HD wallpaper out of that first scene?
I was there last year!! It’s honestly even more gorgeous in real life, you can even buy food and feed them! Such an amazing experience, really recommend doing it if you have the chance!
this isnt “aww” this is “whoaaa”
I was there. If you get to Japan this should be on you list of places to visit.
Stunning - what time of day was the first part of the video?  I am surprised that the deer get so close to you, our country deer are more skittish.
Croke Park, Dublin, Ireland.

I don’ mind
A*doe*able
I thought cherry trees were super toxic to animals.  The cherry blossoms, leaves and bark are all pretty high in cyanide.   Maybe that’s why there are so many leaves on the ground.
When we went 2 years ago we saw a tourist get headbutted so hard it knocked him right off his feet. A super loud truck passing by also spooked the deer and a tonne of them began to dart into traffic, absolute madness.
now this is epic
what keeps the population in check? I assume there are no natural predators over there
I was wondering what a deer blossum was. Haha
とても綺麗ですね
Damn.. This is the most peaceful thing I have seen in a long time.
This better be what Ghost of Tsushima is gonna feel like.
Shit like this makes me sad. Deer should not be this comfortable around people.

It’s an incredible place, only ever been in the summer though and have sadly never managed to be there for Hanami. This looks absolute perfection. Go if you’ve never been.
Ooh I went to Nara last year for the first time and it was awesome, but those CHERRY BLOSSOMS THO 😍
Visiting Nara is still one of my favourite travel experiences. Commenters have already said enough about the deer but I haven't seen one of the more memorable parts of my visit mentioned yet so maybe I just happened to go there on Field Trip day, because when I went the whole park had been invaded by elementary school kids in a variety of ridiculous colourful hats. 

They would wander around in groups approaching anyone who looked foreign and then ask a bunch of pre-prepared English questions and then scribble the answers into their notebooks. Questions like "What's your favourite Japanese food?" "What's your favourite city in Japan?" "What country are you from?". They'd even prepared thank you gifts for people who they interviewed, mostly it was paper cranes which aren't so durable but I scored two handmade laminated bookmarks that I still use today.
u/vredditdownloader
Lots of vendors selling wafers to feed the deer. They are wild but come to the town for the free food. There are several temples / shrines close together so large crowds of people who enjoy the deer are happy to interact with them and feed them. I was there in 2019.

This year was going to be my Japan after so many years of anticipation. I was going to go in cherry blossom season too. I was looking forward and taking a break from the stressful life that is my work. Looking at this video guts me with a rusty jagged blade. I just got a bit teary eyed looking at this...not out of beauty but sadness.

But anyways... This is still very beautiful and I can only be grateful this exists in the world. Thanks for sharing

Deer in Nara Park? Who would have thunk it?
I've seen this anime.   Won't be long before black tentacles pop from the ground and pulls one under.   They'll scatter and run and then eventually go back to lounging around until it happens again.
they look all nice and pretty but don't be fooled; these deer can be vicious if they think you have food. when I visited last summer, my group had bought some rice crackers to feed the deer, but before I had even gotten a hold of any crackers, a deer had sunk its teeth into my dress. He tugged and tugged until he ripped a hole in the fabric. Good thing I was wearing shorts under, but otherwise, it would have been a rough day haha.
It’s beautiful. Thanks for sharing

Are there ticks in Japan? If there are, then there’s probably a lot in that park.

That is so beautiful
My experience was not as serene. I got poked with antlers and bit on the butt then ignored when I ran out of cookies.
So beautiful. If it wasn't for Covid I'd have been there the last two weeks of March. Oh well. Planning for a future trip back to Japan.
If you bow at them, they bow back at you for a cracker :)

Wow..
Hidan is somewhere buried in that park i’m pretty sure

It's always nice to see deer anywhere other than the middle of the road.

Its beautiful, looks like Heaven
Nature's porn.
SO PRETTY
Is that real?
it was so nice having the place not being crowded.
I love how wild life is not scared of the Japanese people... So much peace in Japan
I love finding a harmony with nature. I wish we could do it more. But it's hard for any of us to fight our nature's and stay alive.
Real life Disney movie
Pretty incredible.
The opening scene looks like the beginning of cows & cows & cows.
Precious
Yeah those deers can be pricks, I was bitten by two of them when I was there last year. Still cute though
Dont let the serenity fool you. Those deer are assholes
They look just like a bunch of street dogs

Don't feed wild animals
super beautiful trees, but I can't help but notice the deer fur.  It's all mottled and they are all over the place - then see they're getting fed by people.

hmmmmm.....
