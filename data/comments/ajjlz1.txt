As a father I really treasure some of the smallest things that my children have said or done. Your post is reminding me of a few now, thanks for the post.

Wow... it‚Äôs been wonderful reading all the comments, thanks Reddit!!!!
The fact that he still has it...beyond precious. This made my night. Thank you. 

Edit: Thank you for the comments and the silver. I just hope our little bun has this special relationship with his dad. 
You made a damn solid doll at 5, if I made a doll today it wouldn't last a week nevermind 43 years. 
You made that when you were 5?! Holy crap I'm still trying to get my 4 year old to poop on the toilet!
That is so sweet ... you have made me miss my dad very much. He passed away 2 years ago üò¢ but he is always in my üíô
Your dad is amazing! What a beautiful bond you must have 
Bad ass! Also digging the Kirkland
I have a story like that too :}  I walked into my dad's office at work when I was in college.  And I commented about the drawing of the dust mite on the wall.  Looked kind of artsie and modern.  Turns out I drew it when I was like 5-6 and he had moved it across 4 different states to whatever office he was in.  
Did you cry? I would have cried. 
My dad passed last year and i miss him everyday. We were cleaning out his basement and i found a box full of my childhood artwork he kept. 
Went to my grandmas house oversees when she died two years ago...found a note saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù that I wrote her when I was 4 right before I moved to America üò¢üò¢üò¢
Nothing says ‚Äòdad‚Äô like a Kirkland brand shirt. 
Kirkland.. I see your dad is a man with style.
That‚Äôs so sweet 
That‚Äôs super cool.  
that is the sweetest! so much love! 
The doll is wearing Burberry lol
When I was that age I made my dad paper butterflies and gave him my stuffed animals to accompany him on his deployments. He still keeps the paper butterflies in a box of old things I noticed in one spare closet of our house. Dads are not often sentimental, but when they do stuff like that, we know they love us. 
Well it‚Äôs worked so far.....
My dad was like this. When he passed away I found every school project and card I had ever given him. He saved every single birthday, valentines, Christmas card etc. He passed away on this last Fathers Day, and I miss him every day. Your dad is top notch. Hug him extra. 
I‚Äôm not a good flyer. This reminds me of something that will hold with me forever. 

I have mad anxiety and on a trip from Vegas to Sacramento I was so upset when the plane began to taxi from the terminal I begged them to stop the plane and let me off, sobbing and dry heaving.

Every passenger stared daggers at me knowing I‚Äôd delay the flight.

One of the attendants calmed me down by giving me a child iPad, soda and snacks telling me to be brave and that I could do it. Suggesting breathing techniques and lowering my head.

It worked and I got through the flight. 

At the end him, the crew and pilots all hugged or high fived me and gave me the plastic wings for kids telling me how brave I was.

I was 28. It was JetBlue.

Now at 32 I work for a company that handles their wine program and I‚Äôve never been so loyal or driven to make their program work as best as I can. 

I love this airline and those people that helped me overcome a terrifying trip. 
That is SO sweet! Treasure him!
One of my first flights I was scared but luckily there was a salesman that saw the fear in me and told me to relax and to pay attention to the stewardess.  If they are still walking around everything is fine. That became my safe check. Well one day a bigger plane flew above us then under us which caused some kind of air ripple that hit the plane with turbulence that was brutal. I quickly looked for a stewardess and she had this holy crap we are gonna die look... and that's when I figured I was gonna die(I could hear La Bamba music playing in my head)... Captain later explained what had happened but when we landed I was glad to be on the ground. I still fly but that doll could have been useful to me! 
Speaking as the mom of a 5 year old or two, I'd totally find something that sweet worth holding on to for a lifetime.
Nearly r/MadeMeCry material. Parents, amiright?
When I was probably around 6ish I had one of those bead crafting kits where you can make animals out of pony beads on string. I made my dad a pretty legit snake in red white and blue. His favorite colors. 22 years, and about 5 cars later, my dad still has it hanging from his rear view mirror. The colors are all gone, but he told me he would never take it down because it means so much to him. 
When my dad went for his motorcycle license i gave him a Chuck-E-Cheese token for safety and good luck. I found out a couple months ago that he never rides without it, and it's on his keychain. Dads may not say it much, but it's great seeing how sentimental they can be.
Kirkland. Total dad shirt.
My aunt has a little plastic Mickey she takes on the plane with her. He's her flying buddy because he has a parachute. He's got a parachute backpack that doesnt open. But it makes her feel better because when hes with her, she "has a parachute".
My dad always kept this drawing I made of him and me at his office at work until he retired. He just passed away last week and I would give the whole world for one more visit from him, or even just a phone call. 
This is not a bash, but Dad's love Kirkland brand shirts. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, all the animals posted here are adorable, but it‚Äôs nice to get a break for something like this. Keep it up OP
Bless his sentimental heart...
That is a deft mix of patterns on that doll. Well done.
You must be a sweet little child, op.
And also...
That perfectly folded shirt thoüòç

He should be an extra in the next Toy Story.
[deleted]
I bet he took it on every flight he‚Äôs ever taken. What a lovely keepsake. 
Wait you sewed that together when you were five?? Do you mean like you and your mom did it together as a project or something? Most five year old couldn't even draw that...
I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying 
That is so sweet. 
I definitely would feel secure holding that doll.
Hm....  Forty-three years of safe travel.  I'd say the doll works.
That is amazing. I am not a fan of flying so I can truly appreciate it. 
If he isn‚Äôt wearing a Kirkland plaid button down shirt is he even a dad?
I found some ‚Äúpincushions‚Äù I sewed for my mom when I was eight. She kept them all these years! I‚Äôm 51. 

These little pillows are sad lumps of stitch-saster. I‚Äôm AMAZED you made this detailed doll. And the story is so great!!
Xanax. Give him Xanax. And booze
You made that when you were 5? I¬¥m 40 and I¬¥m pretty sure my attempt on making a doll wouldnt be near as good as yours was. 
god this is to fucking heartwarming
I never got on very well with my little sister, and I used to call her Borris as a joke (sounds similar to her real name).

Once when I was about 20 she wrote a note wishing me luck on my first day, and signed it ‚ÄúLove, Borris X‚Äù.

She doesn‚Äôt know but I keep that note in my wallet and it‚Äôs been nearly 7 years. I only see her once a month or so and things are still not that warm between us but I cherish that note. 
Talk to her daily. Mom keeps very busy. üëçüèº she is dealing way better than her kids
This makes my heart so happy! Does he still hold onto it on the plane? It would be tragic if this treasure was packed in checked luggage and lost by the airline.
ah yes the classic kirkland brand plaid shirt. a dad STAPLE
Is that doll filled with Xanax?
God everybody just eats this fake story up 
This is adorable. The size of the doll is really funny, for a 5YO the doll definitely seemed big enough to provide some comfort for a scared adult! Also, what kind of 5YO can sew so well?! 
Now I just want to get my wife pregnant.

It's going to happen, but the urge lately has been kinda high. 
I'm not crying! YOURE CRYING!!!
I'm pretty sure I have the same shirt as your dad. Bottom right-hand corner, is that a Sonoma double knitted long sleeve tee?
Costco shirts. Every American dad‚Äôs first choice !
Wait a minute. Your Dad shops at Costco too?!?!?  

&#x200B;
Anyone know how comfy those Kirkland shirts are?
Kirkland Signature is a solid dad brand
How the fuck were you making cloth dolls at age 5? I couldn't do this now...
Perfectly folded plaid button up from Costco. Certified Dad. 
Kirkland dress shirt. No better value 
Oh my god, my heart is melting. 
Why am I crying right now?! 
My dad saves all the cards that us kids have given him. That sentimentality is so sweet.
This is beautiful. Blessings to your family OP
Yep, we all need more of this in the world.
Costco Brand clothing is the most Dad thing ever. I love it. 
Aww this is so true. I have a daughter my self and whatever she does really makes me appreciate small things. And this is exactly what keeps us moving and happy in life. Thanks for sharing this!
That is absolutely beautiful. 
Made me cry.
Bravo, Costco, bravo. 
That is fucking adorable
That's really special. Have a great visit!

My blobby?
this made me feel really good.
This is so sweet. 
r/buyitforlife
Thats cute

If he still is, I strongly recommend he read Soar. The book got me flying again after 10 years :)
it looks like a LEGO person
I love this sub
Gawd I‚Äôm bawling my eyes out. This is so godam precious 
That is the dadliest shirt.
My mom threw away a ton of gifts I made for her as a kid, I saw them with my own eyes in the recycling bin. probs a factor of Asian parenting but I think that somehow fucked me up as a grown up.
I found out last summer that my dad carries around our (siblings and I's) school pics from when we were around 4-6 yrs old.

This reminded me of it and it's making me tear up a bit.
Kirkland shirt = 100% dad. 
My dad used to travel 40+ out of 52 weeks a year. When I was 4 I gave him a small plastic chuckie cheese figurine. 18 years later, he still carries it in his travel bag.  
Fathers are awesome....


I miss mine
my dad wears kirkland shirts too.
I could barely color between the lines when I was 5. 
You rotter, made a tear come to my eyes. Things children do for you sometimes break your heart as its done with such love and innocence. Gets me every time I look at things my son made or drew for me when he was tiny like a coloured pencil sketch of me playing football with him inside a coaster which I treasure to this day. Heartwarming photo and lovely doll
Wow after all these years. We are always daddy's little girls. That's so sweet.
Wow. Direct shot to the feels. 
nice
Now that is what I call a family heirloom!
What happens when he pokes a needle in it?
Warms my heart. My boys sent me off on flights, (hating to fly) with their favourite 2 small toys so they knew 'I'd be with them' and knowing 'I'd be back soon because they couldn't be without those toys for too long'. Now one of the (adult) boys packs the same item (a little worse for wear) when he flies as he dislikes flying also. 
When I was small i was always afraid of flying as well. But then one time my father told me to help the pilot by pressing the button(that makes your chair flip) as hard as i can to support the pilot. Well back then i believed him, and we kept doing it for years to come. About 2 years ago I flew the first time purly by myself (no friends etc) and found myself still doing it. Though there were some strange looks from my neigboor.
Come to r/aww to see cute kitten and puppy pictures, find a field of onions instead....

Appreciate all the lovely stories!
I mean if it kept him safe on planes for 43 years I see no reason to stop using it now.. 
Your dad and I have the same Kirkland shirt. I'm 24 years old...
Only the best of father's wear Kirkland signature. 
Costco
Damn I was a bad kid, my dad had to go to the doctor and get some xannys before he could fly
This made my day

I‚Äôm crying over how sweet this is‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠
So sweet it almost made me gag, lol. 
Good dad. 
Damn that‚Äôs beautiful. I wish my dad loved me this much, cherish every second!
This is honestly my favorite post I've ever seen. üò≠üíï
The fact that he‚Äôs packed a Kirkland shirt makes this peak dad
IM NOT CRYING, YOURE CRYING üò≠ 
Idiota
i think this may be the cutest thing i‚Äôve ever seen
Talismans and amulets 
This nearly brought tears to my eyes ... what a wonderful act of generosity from your 5-year-old self.
r/oldschoolcool
That's a really nice shirt.
I love me a good Costco shirt :)
I have that exact same shirt from Costco. Very loose/long fit. 
Animal parents will never get stuff like this
Is your surname "Play-it-safe" ?
Cannot go wrong with Costco branded items. Your father has good taste. 
you made that when you were 5? 
Ah, Costco Kirkland dress shirts... affordable yet mildly stylish.
Costco
Someone Costcos.
When I was 15 I made pants for my pencils... this is way better than that.
Can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a huge shirt or a tiny doll
Makes me think of my dad who also shops at Costco
43 + 5 = 48, check!
Your father buys his clothes at Costco!
Well, he hasn‚Äôt been in a plane crash in all these years, so I guess it still works.
Costco dad shirt, authenticity confirmed. 
Heart warmed.
Ahh, Costco brand Kirkland shirts, I see your father hath discovered the holy grail of button-ups!

Not kidding, I force these on almost any guy I date (if it suits them). 
I know you probably won‚Äôt see this but I did the same thing for my dad when I was 6 I made a bead lizard he still has on his carryon today while he is traveling to China 25 years later. 

He recently traveled with a new employee. On his luggage was almost the exact same lizard that his son made him at the same age I was. 
You're 48!  Yay, math!

Was dad not able to bring it himself?

Neither of my parents made it to my wedding. Treasure your mom.
Very impressive for a doll made by a 5-year-old child
Kirkland Shirts....such a power dad move.
My Dad also shops at Costco.
He had good reasons to be afraid of flying 43 years ago!
Costco shopper. Nice!
This should be a commercial for flying
Isn‚Äôt it ironic?
A fellow Costco man
I just wore that same shirt yesterday
Side note: You know how I overcame my fear of flying?  I read a shit ton of wiki articles on plane crashes.  

As morbid as it sounds, there is a general pattern that a number of things or a chain of events need to go wrong in order for a plane to crash.  It's rarely just a single thing.
My dad has that same shirt.
Reminded me of those math questions in school where we had to guess the age x :)
How is your dad‚Äôs shirt folded so perfectly?! I can never get it that perfect especially when I‚Äôm traveling 
Yes to the Kirkland shirt üëçüèº 
He‚Äôs a Costco man. Brings a tear to my eye.
That‚Äôs super nice handiwork for such a young ‚Äòun. 
Wish I had a dad
Looking like a boss though, in head to toe Costco. 
You're 48 years old!
Ah. A Costco shopper. They have af one decent clothes believe it or not.
He shops at CostCo too üëçüèº
Kirkland Signature plaid shirt - dad confirmed
Perfectly folded shirt. 
Either that doll is very small or the dad is a giant
Is that Mr blobby? 
There‚Äôs no doubt in my mind this post is legitimate and that your story isn‚Äôt just fabricated for likes. My evidence? The fact that the owner of that suitcase has packed a Costco Kirkland brand shirt. Can only be a dad. 
This just made my day. I have two little boys- 3 years old and 2 months old. I hope they grow up to be as sweet and thoughtful as you. Plus, I‚Äôm scared of flying too so I need someone to make me a damn doll!!
Wow just wow that doll is even older than me 
Mr. Bill? 
I lost my father when I was small. This article really does touch my heart.
Anyone else misunderstood the title thinking the dad was the pilot and scared to fly? 
Kirkland button down shirt. Can confirm 100% dad. 
Carry on.  
My son made the Overwatch logo out of plastic beads and then used an iron to melt it a bit and make it a solid piece. It‚Äôs the first thing I put on the desk in my room when I‚Äôm in a hotel. 

Source: I had 122 nights at Hilton properties last year. 
That's so cute it's insane. 
Is your dad lookin like a boss tho in head to toe Costco? 
Calculate the age of the father.
He's a Costco man... respect üòâ‚úå 
Have a good visit! 
This is so precious 
Looks similar to the Mr. Bill doll 
We must know this dolls name!
Not sure what's more dad, the fact that he kept the doll for this many years or the Kirkland shirt.
No parachute?   Yeah same for my dad 
"OH NOoooooooo!"
In good condition too üò¢
Soooo, you're 35, right?
Perfect!
Comment to make it 667
The is the best and most wholesome thing and we should protect it at all costs
Amazing job on moms behalf for keeping this beloved treasure safe for so many years!
Dad level 5000
For anyone curious, I did the math. Op is 48 years old. 
I see your pops shops at the Costco, those are good peoples.
ah kirkland signature. i too am a man of culture
This picture screams Costco 
Beep boop beep, you are 47.
My heart ‚ô• just melted üíï 
This is incredible and a great example of why I use reddit. Thanks for the post! It was very sweet
Lovely handiwork for a five year old! ‚úçÔ∏èüß∏üéé
>tried not to cry

>cried
Isn‚Äôt this the sweetest story behind a little gesture of comfort ever told? :‚Äô)
Precious. 
Those Kirkland brand shirts are awesome.
My gramps wears Kirkland, I love it. 
I wonder how does it feel when your parents care enough about you to come visit. Op, I hope you cherish them as much as they do you! 
Can I get one of these? 
I have a stuffy I was able to save from my childhood. 30+ years old, was with me through pneumonia and other ailments of my youth. Gave it to my daughter. When I get a cold, she tells me my stuffy wants to help me again and gives it to me until I get better.

So many onions in here...
I am ashamed that I haven't made anything for my dad.
You must have had great crafting ability for it  to survive 43 years. :)
I made a pair of "flip-flops" for my dad as a birthday present when I was between 6 and 10 (I only remember the time span since my dad was away for those years) so he could travel back home to visit me. 

They were basically pieces of packing styrofoam and strings taped together. I'm surprised they managed to stay intact for over 20 years but a couple years back he pulled them out to show my girlfriend and said it's one of the best presents he's received. 

We don't have the best of relationships but a father never forgets and I know he tries his best. Thanks for reminding me of this.
r/thathappened ?
That's really wonderful. 

I'm going to make this the last bit of internet for my day and go to sleep with a smile. 

Thank you for sharing! 
I made my dad a drawing of us holding hands together on a post it note 16 years ago when I was 4. He stuck it on his pencil holder and has kept it there ever since. I‚Äôm surprised the adhesive has held up this long but it made me really happy to know that he‚Äôs held onto something like that for all these years.
Only real dads shop at Costco üòè
How did you make a doll at the age of 5? An adult must have helped you 
This is truly a treasure and so precious 
You know it's a big deal if he is packing the Kirkland Signature.  That's what the best Dads wear.  
This seems like a math problem
I can feel the love that doll harnesses from here 
I keep my old teacher training books 'cos they have drawings from my son. they are from when he was three, the pics are  on the inside of the covers. everytime I use them for reference it makes me think of him so much.
Think you could make me one of those? 
Creepy, but also, adorable 
So cute!

When I was 4 I gave my dad a heart shaped stone i found on holiday. 25 years later,  it's still in his wallet and whenever he gets a new wallet it's the first thing transferred so he doesn't lose it. ‚ù§
Handsome shirt!
This is so cute!
Dear God, I just burst out crying lol
That's sooo cute!
Just watched Sully on Netflix, yea get him to watch that the day of his flight.
...But he doesn't hold it, he packs it. ü§î Still nice.
lol, my parents always threw my art stuff away. 
Also that is the perfect dad shirt
My heart warmed up so much. Ty for sharing!
So many TSA Agents were creeped out finding this. 

Really cute though, my Dad has a doggo bobble head from me and has for 20 yrs.  So many feels now. 
Okay, a little back of the napkin math here...
^(made it when you were 5, carry the one,  43 years old) it's impossible we'll never figure out how old OP is. 
I had a purple and blue plastic gems about the size of a quarter. I took the purple and gave it to my dad and kept the blue for when he went on work trips. I would keep the blue under my pillow. I have it on my shelf next to my bed even though I'm moved away in my own apartment at college.

I have seen it just chilling in his office over the years where he spends his time. 

Now we greet each other with "Good Morning star shine the earth says hello!" "Good morning earth and all who inhabit it!" 
That such an adorable story ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh my Lord, this is so freaking sweet! It touches my heart. You must really love each other. 
That is beautiful.
I wish my dad & I were this close :(
About 15 years ago, I bought my father a pen. He had to write a lot for his work so I gave him a pen with his name on it, to show everyone that it was his pen.

Some years ago I moved out, so I was searching out my stuff in the attic. There I found that pen, still in the plastic wrapping. I decided to not tell my dad and just put the pen for sale. The price was having the same name as my dad. If he wasn't happy with it, I would be sure to find a stranger who would be.

Still causes me to not want to buy him any presents, as I feel that he won't appreciate them
This is so touching üò≠
This is so sweet. 
Aww that is so sweet! 
Am happy for you but when I first read the title I thought the dad is coming back after 43 years..
This is super sweet... my dad saved a lot of my old art, from stuff I drew when I was a preschooler (taped on the inside of his dresser), to what is essentially Grateful Dead fanart he asked me to make for a competition in high school (framed in our living room).

Fuck. I have to call him when it's not three in the morning.
Man is that thing awesome. No wonder your dad kept it!
[deleted]
Sweet
That is the cutest father-child thing I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. ‚ù§Ô∏è
After my dad passed away  My brother was going through his things ( I wasn't there at the time, I was on the other side of the world. Trying to get a flight back).  In his wallet he had an old newspaper clipping of a novice hockey game where I'd  scored 4 goals in a game. When I saw it I lost it. I don't really remember the game, wasn't a big deal to me but he carried that around for over 30+ years.
I'm a regular 20-year old dude.
Not planning to be a father for a long time.
But I somehow get your dad.
Can we have a picture or something?
Always warms my heart.
Does Kirkland make everything and is it everywhere lol 
How did you make that at 5 years old?? 
I carry in my wallet a picture with my mom (she was 17-18 in that pic). Little things make you feel safe wherever you go. :) 
The mathematician in me predicts op will have their 49th birthday this year.

...is it had that is the first thing my mind did with this post? #engineerproblems
Awww! That's so cute! 
I'm afraid of flying too.  But I use what men use to get over it.  Booze and xanax...But I'm willing to try that little doll. 
But he's packing it so itll go under the plane. He is doing it wrong 
I‚Äôm not crying. You‚Äôre crying.
He also shops at Costco. 
I remember I gave my dad a seal plushie to take with him when he used to travel a lot. He‚Äôd always take pictures of the seal in different places.
Costco rulz
Omg. This is so touching. My Dad died a little over 5 years ago. I think about him every day. Spend as much time with yours as you can. 
miss me with that natalism
That's beautiful. 
Should have told him to make fists with his toes.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
I‚Äôm a Costco dad too.  :)
This is the cutest thing I've read all day, thanks for sharing!
That is so sweet! I'm actually bawling. Relationships like this are so precious.
I see your father is a Sam's club guy, good man!
I have the same shirt. I am 20
That is awesome
Typical dad shirt
Sitting and my desk and crying now. ‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è‚òπÔ∏è I miss my daddy 
Amazing x
I have that shirt. I call it woo blue brown. 
Its not similar, but when I was born my older sister bought me a little teddy bear, I am 20 years old and still have that teddy bear
im not crying its just raining in my house!
You‚Äôre old
Real Dads try anything for their kids. There are times they fail, but they try. His love outweighs his fear.
I have a fear of flying, i hope sonething like this will one day comfort me. 
I'm glad you are 48 and your parents are still alive. Blessed
My dad has the same Costco shirt lol
That's a good brand of shirt. 
Is there a pair of Kirkland court classic sneakers and a pair of Kirkland dungarees in that travel bag as well? 
Be still my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Wow held up well, how sweet
Posts about loving dads always hits me right in the feels!
This... this is good
I didn't know you invented Mr Blobby
/r/herodad
Kirkland, I see your father is a man with extravagant taste. I respect it.
I'm wearing Kirkland underwear right now, I'm a size large these are extra large. and the elastic is still strangling my waist, sizing , how does that work?
Dad approved Kirkland button down
heck yes kirkland brand shirt.... I love costco!
I have that shirt, lol.
See as soon as I get on a flight with that and it goes smoothly I'm now mentally fucked and have to bring it every time. "Well if I don't bring my travel buddy it's going to go to shit" 
Story checks out, definitely a dad shirt!
Kirkland shirt, dad confirmed
Pure Sweetness...  :)
This is the sweetest!

Also Costco for life!!!!
Aww! I miss my dad
I'm not crying. Who's crying? You're crying!
I made my dad a bead lizard in the 90's when i was in elementary school and he still has that haggard thing hanging from his rear view mirror. He isn't always present (mostly not around) and isnt the "best" father, but this brought back some really great memories.
Plaid Kirkland-brand shirt, dad status confirmed.
You made that doll at 5 years of age?  I'm as old as that doll,and could not make something like that!
Thanks for the post, as a dad it made my eyes wet.
Costco dad
Had no idea Kirkland made shirts too! What a world
Those kirkland shirts, yes! 
Very sweet. Thanks for posting you reminded me of so many small things I've had to keep over the years.
From what I can tell, that's some damn fine craftsmanship for 5 y/o
TIL you were a better artist at 5 than I am today
My first thought was ‚ÄúYour Dad is HUGE‚Äù
You guys remember that doll Michael made Oscar?
When my parents were moving, the last thing left in the entire house was a shelf filled with old stuff from me and my brother and sisters past. Drawing, notes, school reports, etc. I went through it and the thing that stood out to me the most was something I never saw before. 

My dad had typed out a poem on his computer and printed it out. It was a poem about me, must of typed it when I was really young. It was a super sweet poem, badly written though. Reminded me of a poem a kid would type. 

The thing is, Ive never seen that side of my dad. My family is a no-touchy and dont-show-your-feelings kind of family. We just know we love eachother. It made me bawl so hard. 
Those costco shirts will ensure your father has a nice dry comfy shirt to change into after he nervously sweats through his current shirt.
It made my day. Really cute!!!
My daughter gave me a little Kinder-Egg Cinderella toy to keep in my pocket during my business flight when she was 2.  I still struggle with anxiety and hate flying, and I still have that little Cinderella toy.
Creepy
My mom still has the first ever mother's day gift i made her when i was 3
I adore this! My Dad was also terrified to fly. So much so that when we would visit family across country in Philadelphia he would rent a car and leave four days before us to meet us there.  Wish he was still around I'd make him one of those. 
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying 
I‚Äôm not crying, you are.
Your mom is good at ironing.
Awwwwwww
That Kirkland shirt tho
I have a teddy bear that I still sleep with every night. He is 32 yrs old. I am 37. He was a gift from my grandparents when I started kindergarten. He goes with me when I have to sleep anywhere besides home. My (now ex) husband would even take him to sleep with when I got up for early morning shifts and he was still sleeping. There is something comforting about having something soft to hug while you sleep.
Kirkland signature, the choice of dads everywhere.
I up voted op for the Kirkland shirt... dolls cool too
How sweet is that :)
Holy shit that is the most adorable human on human post I‚Äôve seen on Reddit
That's so incredibly sweet!! 
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è lovely ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I wish my dad would come and visit me and my kids, but he decided to break with me 16 years ago üòî
any guy wearing a kirkland shirt has my trust
To anyone reading this: Don't put off having your parent(s) come visit you. 
So you are 48
**Very beautiful**

And

**Great**

Small but **wonderful deal**
My daughter snuck in to my bathroom at 10 pm and put a bunch of stickers on my mirror (she was 8) the night before I was leaving for work for a week. I still carry them with me while traveling 10 years later.. [Stickers](https://hive.cpufu.com/index.php/s/q7AAn2agQwTojjn)
My dad wouldn‚Äôt even remember the name of my book if I wrote a New York Times best seller üôÑ
Wow! So, you‚Äôre 63?
I love this! My dad used to travel a lot for work and when I was little I gave him my favorite little spongebob candy dispenser to take with him. Whenever he would leave for a trip I made sure I refilled the spongebob with skittles (his favorite). He would send pics of all the places spongebob went with him
Mine is a little different.  My Dad passed away this past July.  He and my mom divorced when I was a year old.  He was in his mid to late 30s when they had me.  I never really saw the resemblance, but he swore that I was his twin.  By the time I was a man he was mid to late 50s, but he swore I was his twin.  The memory I have of him is from his keys, he had a dog tag on his key ring from when he was drafted, and a small can opener.  He never really made a big deal about it, but it was just something that was a constant in my visits to him.

When he passed they made a video, and in the video was Dad at my age, dad in the service, dad as a young man.  It broke me right there.  I was his twin, and I had never seen the pictures.  I remember feeling a connection to him that I hadn't felt while he was alive, because honestly there were a lot of points in life where I wondered if he was really my father.  I'm almost a foot taller than he is, I'm thin, he's fat, etc.

Like dad I did my time in the service, and after his funeral I gave my stepmother one of my dog tags...the one I actually wore.  "Please add this to dad's key ring".  She went to the room and came back, with the dog tag and the little can opener.  "He'd want you to have it".

Now dad's tag is on my keyring, and maybe someday my son will understand what it meant.
Wow. A 5 year old made that! You are incredible and cute. 
Thank you for your kind words
Aww, that little guy will always protect him. 
How beautiful & sweet!!
This is the cutest 
This is ridiculously precious. 
If we were all in a zombie or a horror movie, you should be one of the families that escapes
I‚Äôm 30 and wouldn‚Äôt even know where to start on making a doll like that.
I don't think I could even make that doll now and I'm 37
God damn sweaty eyeballs 
Aww. This gives me the feels. 
How sweet is that! Stop it with the onions already. 
Ohhhh man. That's so damn wholesome. 

What a treasure
Sentimental value beats everything.
Dads are the sweetest. Mine still carries on his work briefcase a birthday card I made him when I was just learning to write.
I wrote a poem once when I was about 13-14. My Dad loved it and kept it in his wallet. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs still there. 
That‚Äôs absolutely adorable, and the doll is soooo cute. 
This is the sweetest dad story
Kirky Sig button up? You dad knows how to dad
Crying 
Why am I crying
Kirkland button down. Definitely a dad. 
Ur 48!? NANI!?
You two must have a very beautiful relationship. I teared up a little üò™
*single tear cry
Very adorable and sweet. I cherish everything my children have made for me.
This is so adorable. I'm not crying you're crying
My dad is a very manly dude who likes nascar and hockey. He‚Äôs had a painting I made of a tiny fluffy dog on a pink background hanging in his room for years.
My father passed away today and I found out he has been carrying a money clip that I got him when I was in elementary school. I bought it at the school book fair. I don't remember exactly what grade I was in but he has been carrying it for \~30 years.
When I was in early elementary school, I made my dad a ‚Äúpocket mouse‚Äù with a little craft kit I got as a gift. It was made out of bright pink felt and it was a little mouse that you put in your shirt pocket and the little googly eyes and nose stick out. He proudly wore it to work and he still has it today. 
Awwww Dads are the best. Mine carried a stone in his pocket every day that I gave him when I was a kid. I can picture the stone now, it was probably on his bedside when he passed ready to be put into his pocket the next morning. 
This shit almost made my eyes cut onions
I have my daughter‚Äôs hug doll with me always ... uh... hello... 
burberry fabric? good choice. it‚Äôs much easier to sneak into first class lounges if you‚Äôre dressed the part.
This is awesome.
This is so sweet üíñ I love little stories that show how much parents cherish the things their children make for them. 
This is the most wholesome post. 
I love this so much. 

My dad flies a lot for business (we‚Äôre talking 360 days a year) and when we were younger my sister and I would sneak in one of our toys into his suitcase. 
I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying. Damn allergies 
Damn that is really cute.
Ah, Kirkland. Your father is a man of refined tastes I see.
It being in such good condition shows how much it meant/means to him.  Very cool post OP.  
That's amazing and so sweet!! .. can you make me one as well :)
I'm not crying... You're crying!
My dad has had the same wallet for 20 years.  It must be 5 inches thick with all his $2.00 he carries.  But tucked in the back are pictures of me and my two older sisters when were 3, 5,  and 7 years old.  I just turned 51 last year.  I love my dad and it makes me sad to think that he‚Äôll be gone one day. 
Wow time to cry
Cuteness level 1000
Your dad is cool love the shirt! I have the same one and I was wearing it today.
That's so sweet! I did something similar with my dad when I was little too. I got him this small stuffed dog plushie for him so he could have a stuffed animal to keep him safe like I did and whenever he deployed he would take the dog plushie with him. My dad still has it to this day üíï though mine is only about 10 or 11 years old but I hope he and my mom keep a hold of it forever.
When you realize you were dumb enough not to give anything to your parents in your childhood.
This is so wholesome.  And that doll is better than anything I could make now.
Well this is just the cutest thing ever!
When my adult daughter was about 3, she packed a bunch of plastic food in her dad's briefcase before he went on a trip because she thought he needed lunch. He was so tickled by it when he got to his destination. 
This made me cry and miss my dad
\*Hep* *choking back tears sound*
aww! My dad an I (I'm 25 and have been traveling for ~9 months a year for the last 6 years) have this little koala keychain, the ones that you pinch their back and it makes their arms able to hold onto things. His name is Auggie. My dad has faithfully hid him in my backpack for every single trip since I was 16. His passport would have around 25 stamps in it now. Everytime I go on a trip, I write notes to my parents and hide them around the house. Sometimes I just use lipstick on the mirrors, other times I have hidden 30 post-it notes. They've kept all of the notes and don't clean the lipstick off the mirrors until I get home
That is a sweet Costco button-up though

This is the kind of post I needed to see today. Thank you.
He kept a cherished gift from his child AND he knows where to find a good bargain on shirts? A man after my own heart.
Back in those days a five year old could make a doll. Today they can hardly draw one on a tablet. 
It's amazing what parents hold on to both physically and emotionally. To your dad you will always be 5 when he holds that doll. 
This is really sweet and wholesome. Honestly touches my heart. üíú
When I was a kid I gave my father one of my stuffed frogs to keep (like my favorite animal at the time) since my parents weren't together and my dad at the time lived in a different  state. This way when we weren't together he would have something of mine to remind  him of me. By the time highschool rolled around, we were living in the same state again, and by the time I left for the Navy we were living just down the street from each other. Fast forward a few months later and my dad takes his own life. When I went back home on leave to clean out his apartment, I found my stuffed frog on his bed, he had kept it all those years and I never knew.
The doll is starting to look 43 based on that beer gut.  It‚Äôs always the same old story, you start off partying with the guys in the Land of Make Believe, taking some cute puppet home in the Barbie Corvette almost every week, but eventually middle age hits and you find yourself alone on the couch in the dollhouse watching TV alone with a 12 pack of cheap beer, the end of another pack of smokes, and memories of when you were king.
God, I wish I had a father like this growing up. My father was and is such a monster. You're very lucky, OP. 
I like imagining him packing like going through his checklist, like " shirts check, pants check, underwear check, socks check, little flying buddy double check" makes me smile to think about
I'm NOT crying.
Oh fork, this is so cute. 
The Kirkland‚Äôs and proof he‚Äôs a dad. 
I'm a 33 years old man on a train to work tear up like a little kid, Thanks OP.
Is this a tiny suitcase or a huge shirt? 
Tat doll is scarier than flying 
I love that - only except that the shirt was purchased at Costco. No one should buy clothes at Costco. But that is so sweet.

&#x200B;
You‚Äôre 48. Old af better start saying your goodbyes now
Did you buy that dress shirt from Costco 
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying
Omw. This is precious beyond words.

Eta: Interesting, been noticing all my genuine and sincere compliments are being downvoted.

Aw, I think I have a downvote stalker... how cute!
Ok this made me cry but clearly his mom packed his luggage 
someone who is a millionaire and can afford it give this post gold!!!!
I call BS, your dad isn't afraid of flying!
My dad couldn't even be bother to drive 5 hours to visit me for Christmas. Your father is an amazing man! 
Oh my parental feels >.<
This is so incredibly sweet. üò≠
Ok, that's really friggen cute. 
Wow this almost turned stopped me from being dead inside. I think i felt a beat.
it kept him safe....good doll
Now that is a treasure
Not trying to cry in a laundromat, asshole!
That‚Äôs really impressive. Pretty sure I was still eating dirt at 5 years old. Probably made a dirt pie for my dad.
Thats super sweet. I love it.  
Wholesome voodoo doll.
r/wholesomememes 
Legacy!! 
why is this making me cry wow
Oh my God. I'm going to go cry and then find someone to impregnate me immediately and hope that I have a kid as sweet as you üò≠
This is the best thread ever.
This is too damn adorable. My heart is having feelings.
This reminds me of when I had to clean out my mom's apartment after she passed. Was cleaning out her dresser and I found a tiny picture of me from kindergarten that was from a Valentine's day card I made. Then a pot from 3rd grade. Then some origami from 6th grade. I cried so hard because I figured these things were gone and forgotten but she kept them all these years 
My dad read a note at my wedding that  I had written him as a little girl asking if it was okay if I never got married or if I could just marry him so I could live with him forever. I had no idea he had that or that I had even written that. Everyone at the reception was in tears, myself included . üò≠ Dads are the best. 
I had a really, really shitty day surrounded by even shittier people. 

This made it all better.  That's a great dad you have, and you're a great kid.

Thanks for posting.
5yo you sounded absolutely adorable 
So. Fucking. Heartwarming.
Thank you. 
That is extremely sweet 
I like this post a lot. 
Make me wanna cry. üò≠
Being someone that has lost her dad (and mom) I‚Äôm up-voting all comments (while sobbing in a bowl of ice cream, don't judge). 
I think this is my favorite reddit post ever üòä
That‚Äôs the sweetest 
Cool, yes, thanks, crying now.
Somewhat I m like this....
I like this but I am not dad....
Sooo damn cute!
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying! 
As a father flying a lot this year, I always found myself repeating "I love you Emily" in my head during takeoff and landings, believing that our connection would keep the plane safe or the gods would hear and make sure we were reunited always. 
Automatic Tears...
And yet not even a single scratch on the doll :)
That must make u 48 
Wait 48 year olds use reddit? 
High quality content, and a high quality, great doll! Items like these are very precious to most parents, and I see why he'd cherish it. May it keep traveling (and your dad with it) for many years to come. 

I remember how our dad kept using our self made leather keychains until they fell apart. 
Will you make me a doll? I hate flying too :(
So basically, you are 48 years old as to date and you have your own family. I hope that your sons and daughters will give you something that will motivate you, encourage you, and strengthen you as a parent. Something you will treasure forever like what your father did. :)
Lasts longer then Valium 
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!
That‚Äôs so touching...wish I had money to give you gold 
I find it so interesting stuff like this can comfort and help us. Yet, realistically, a doll is going to do nothing in the event of a plane nose diving. The human brain is so interesting.
Let's see... Carry the 1 and you are..... Old.
Fuckin' white men and their plaid Kirkland shirts.
[removed]
This story checks out...only real dads wear Kirkland button downs. 
Holy cats, that‚Äôs fricken awesome. Makes my little heart smile
Beautiful 
Told myself I wouldn‚Äôt cry this January, failed. 
Omg üò™ this is just too sweet. Dads are the best (and so are little ones that make special dolls). Hope you all have a great time together!
That's so nice! What a sweet story!
Ohhh that is so great... love ya shared that.  What a dad an even more awesome of a daughter 
My heart. 
Sometimes, I get nervous on airplanes
ouch my heart
Kirkland button down, confirmed Dad
Soo cute! 
Words can‚Äôt describe how much I love this. 
My daughter still randomly finds things she made for me when I went on trips. Going on 10 years. I keep them in my travel bags.
I'm not crying, you're crying 
48 year old redditor. QUICK MAFS
That's beautiful. 
my eyes r watering omg
This makes my heart break. I lost my father when I was 35, and he was the kind of dad who would cherish a keepsake like that. I cut a lock of hair that is at rest with him, so he will always have a piece of me to keep
The first words that left my mouth when I saw this we're "oh my gah that's so fucking cute."

I'm in the bathroom with my dog.. 
Lovely.
That's a very cute doll. :)
Love the Costco dad-shirt. I think I have a few, or twenty.  And, aww.
I‚Äôm rlly about to cry over this you are the best person ever and your parents are so lucky to have you 
This is wholesome content 10/10
That is a beautiful little doll.
Aww!

That‚Äôs adorable!

God bless you, your father, and that doll!
This reminds me of the Mother‚Äôs Day and Father‚Äôs Day pins I made in first grade that are still hanging on our freezer, never really thought how much the little stuff means to our parents.
Ha. So you are 36.
Scab
MY DADFY STILL KEEPS THE CIGARETTE WE SHARED WHEN I STOLE THE PACK FROM HIM AND HE SLIPPED AND FELL WHILE HE WAS CHASING ME WITH THE HOSE! FUNNY THING IS THE FUCKER IS IN A COMMA FROM HIS FALL AND I JUST SLIPPED A FINISHED CIG BUTT IN HIS POCKET FUCKER! 
Respect
Almost looks like Mr. Blobby!  I love it!
aww
Finally an awww that is actually cute and not just a picture of someone's dumb dog.
That's sweet.
Am I the only one confused by proportions? Is the doll teeny tiny or is that shirt gigantic?
You‚Äôre fuckin old 
tell your dad to grow a pair while he holds a doll
Hahahahahahahahahaahahagahahahahagahahahahahahahahahahahahahahagahagshahshahahahahahahahagagagagagagagagagagahagagagagagahagagahsgsgsgsgagagagagahagagagagagavagagavavagagagagavavagagagavagagavagagagsgagagagsgsgagsgsgsgsgsgsgdhfjturueyegsgagageyeheheheheheheheheheheheyeyeyeyeyeteggehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe/ yeet
How is this aww material? It's a picture of a shirt and a fucking doll, with a sentimental bullshit backstory that could just as well be OP's imagination
