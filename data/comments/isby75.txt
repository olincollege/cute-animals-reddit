Go ninja, go ninja, go ninja, go!
This turtle really said "this is fine, but what if I went vertical?"
He’s no mutant but 100% ninja!
Terrapin of fucking sheer will and commitment. it will climb the corporate steps even though many told it that being a terrapin is good enough, what more does it want in life? No, not this terrapin. It has enough of the corporate bullshit lettuces fed to it daily, it’s taking matter into its own hands by seizing the evil corporation!
Jeez i was  not expecting that zoom-in to *increase* the quality of the video
Tortoises are surprisingly good climbers. I took care of two at the zoo, and could not keep one of them on the damn ground. The second I was in the enclosure she was climbing my boots. One day, we found her stuck about 4 feet up the wall between a fake cactus. She was on a mission.
Cowabunga dude!
He comin to take your pizza and your girl
Parkour!!
What I need is these gif with the 80s theme song playing.

How did he climb up onto the stairs at the end? Also what would he even do once he's there??
Teenage mutant ninja turtles, teenage mutant ninja turtles, *gibberish gibberish* TURTLE POWER!
Somewhere off screen I picture this turtle’s dad yelling: “Righteous! RIGHTEOUS!”
Us climbers call that stemming!
The poor guy forgot his mask
For real though, turtles are escape artists. I had a box turtle with an outdoor pen, and no matter what we did they would always find a new way to get out of it and eat stuff out of the garden instead of the food we gave her. She even pushed rocks up against the wall until they were tall enough for her to climb over.

However, with all these chemicals in the water, there's no doubt it's a mutant
Turtles can climb??
I can't be the only one who "heard" the TMNT theme watching this.
Believe it or not turtles are actually extremely good climbers. Believe they climb trees to feed on insects and stuff
Thanks for all the awards, guys! Almost 400 as I write!

Edit: Not sure why this would be downvoted, I'm simply thanking people since > 400 is just too many to respond individually to everyone. Reddit is weird sometimes :-)

The long lost spider turtle has returned. 2020 is gonna get better now.
Seriously
I have never been so proud of a child that wasn't mine.
I had this crazy fever dream once when I was on painkillers after a surgery about a turtle that managed to climb up the couch, then onto my head.

The dream started where he was across the living room, and then I woke up and fell back asleep. And the turtle had moved closer. Then I woke up and fell asleep again, and he was closer. Rinse and repeat until I finally fell back asleep and the turtle is on the back of the couch. Then the next time I did the wake up/fall asleep routine, I got up from the couch and looked all over for this turtle, only to look up into the mirror over the back of the couch and find him on top of my head. Like a little bowler cap.

Anyway, what I'm saying is this is clearly that turtle.

I used to own a box turtle that we would let wander the house from time to time. I often would find him on beds, couches, even high ledges. If there was anything he could grab into with his feet he could climb it. He was particularly fond of using the curtains to get to places.
OMG !!! They existe !!!!
The early concept of The Last Ronin seems more lighthearted

Cowabunga!
Turtles come out of their Eggs buried 3 to 4 feet deep in moist beach sand and they have to crawl up and out thru all that sand.  you should try that someday.. 

 baby turtles are looking for the ocean..  they have oceans to roam..  they are trying to get high enough to see the ocean or at least some water in an attempt to get to it. .

 if that was a tortoise .. it might be looking for the Desert..
Donatello be looking fresh 👀

TURTLES IN A HALF SHELL
Little known fact but most common turtles and tortoises can climb vertical surfaces like walls and small cliffs


When I was a small child, a turtle climbed a ten foot wall into my schools garden and ate all the veggies we were growing as a project
Cuteeeee

Wow soi cute!

Great Parkour skills
That’s Polnareff!
We have a (not so small now) red eared slider, 12 years old, lives in a pretty good set up with filters, heater, basking light UVB bulb etc.

Most days I take him out of the tank while he parades around behaving as if he owns the house.

His aquarium is in the spare room upstairs (important to note he is on the upper floor).

Anyway while on holiday (vacation) for a week our daughter would come round each day to feed and if necessary clean his tank.

We arrive home, dump the suitcases and I check on the turtle, everything is fine. Turtle seems happy to see us and begins splashing about.

Sadly myself and the wife had to go out to visit different family members.

At some point our turtle somehow managed to climb out of the tank ???? Drop about 2 foot onto the window sill (a small piece of shell was left behind).

Fall 3 feet onto the floor.

He then walked out of the room and managed to tumble down a full flight of stairs.

Wife arrives home (dark at this time) and sees something at the bottom of the staircase, thinking we had "dropped a sock" from the luggage and nudges this "sock" with her foot.

Yes the turtle.

So around two feet to the window, three feet onto the ground them down a full flight of stairs.

He was fine with mild abrasions to his front knees. I kept him in a dry plastic tub for a couple of nights, only putting him back into the tank for a hour or so per day for feeding etc.

I believed the tank was escape proof but he got out, since then the security has had a major upgrade and no successful escapes since.

So, excellent climbers and much quicker than you would imagine.
This is really common
So far away from its natural habitat 😕
So a friend of a friend's father used to be a hoarder, and an eccentric man to boot. When said friend of a friend was a kid the bathtub was used as a home for a pet turtle. One day the turtle disappeared. Years later the turtle was found mummified gripped halfway up a corner of a room behind a stack of newspapers which reached to the cieling
Oh my gosh 😍
