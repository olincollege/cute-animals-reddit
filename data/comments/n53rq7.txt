She‚Äôs royalty and She Knows It
such amaze, wow
This is doge 8 years ago, and this is doge now, feel old yet?
What age does to a dog and legend.
Oh you *love* doge?

Name 5 of her albums
My dear Doge Kato lived to be 18, He changed his looks like this. He became such a perfect gentleman( he chewed through the walls and ate furniture as a puppy).
Wow
She's a Queen. We need to protect her at all costs.
Jesus after seeing so many edits and shit. The original doesn‚Äôt even look real
I didn't know doge changed color over time
Prediction: Dogecoin is gonna skyrocket in her honor once she's gone
I remember reading that the dog in this photo is not actually Kabosu every time this is reposted.

I checked out her Instagram (@kabosumama) and it looks nothing like the dog in this photo. She looks in way better health.
2013 wasn't it 5 years ago?
I am definitely going to cry when the news finally hit. She's the face of the internet's favorite dog species AND the hottest crypto.
I know I‚Äôm late to the show, but can someone explain the origination of ‚Äúdoge‚Äù? Was it a misspelling?
[removed]
I really hope dogs evolve longer lifetime, although doge has been taken care very well but you still can see 15y is very old for a dog.
very age

much wise

wow
Dog, can confirm
[deleted]
i don't like seeing my memes age :(
Her birthday is February 25 so it just past lets make the next one great
Such impressive.

Now she‚Äôs leading people to the moon üöÄ what a legend
I wish dogs lived longer :(
r/Dogelore Assemble

Just seeing that reminds me of the Doge song a youtuber made. I must listen to it again.
Fucking legend
Here to pay my respects to a legend. Swole doge vs cheems is the best meme and you made it all possible.
Y‚Äôall had the same couch for 15 years? It must be comfy as fuck.
How iconic ü•≥ü•≥ü•∞
Such age many grace
Such a beautiful dog! :)
She probably has no clue she's the most famous dog in the world right now
Same couch, same spot üëÄ
How the coin looks now vs how it will look in 6 months
Owner needs to sell the pictures as NFT and make some money off that MEME DOGE COIN
Type ‚ÄúThank you, sweet pupper‚Äù in chat for 15 years of good luck
15 and looks like she is still 5 <3
Damn, she's seen a few winters
Ok so... can I pet her? I promise to invest more
wooow
No way that‚Äôs so cool
Is this true?
Good girl.
Amazing dog She look so cute
I thought my dog was.
I hope she owns a bunch of doge coin
Do not cite the dogecoin to me.  I was there when it was written.
Yes but how much dogecoin does she have?
A very good girl!
Shibe
olde doge
What a cutie!! Give her a hug for me

This post is going straight to the top
No longer a joke but became royalty
OP not sure if that‚Äôs your dog or you‚Äôre just trying for karma but uhhhh NFT that dog
Much age. Such wisdom.
She‚Äôs resting in retirement!
Our glorious leader! Much wow!
Arguably the most famous dog on the planet?
üêïüöÄüåô
Now she be cashing out and making coin.
Yes, this is doge
the dogecoin millionaires need to make sure Kabosu well taken care of!!
She's no longer doge, she is dog√©
doggo want snacc
It boggles my mind to think I might one day being paying my mortgage with a Reddit meme coin.
She became a coin.
Why do smaller dogs live  generally longer than bigger dogs?
To the moon üöÄ
She's keeping the same posture. What a good girl. I hope she's enjoying her golden years in comfort.
I salute you
Clone doge!!
How beautifull
The fact that the same picture frame and couch is still there amazes me.
such wow, very old
Such hodl!! To the mooooooooon
Such adorable. Wow.
I have a Shiba Inu and this hits home for me so much. Our girl is special needs and we adopted her when she was four, she has a black coat with tan eyebrows instead of the traditional doge coloring. We celebrate her birthday on the same day as our other dog because the vets couldn‚Äôt determine her actual age due to her teeth being so worn down. 

Anyway - she turned 11 last month and has the equally majestic gray snout and paws and my partner and I love her dearly and are so proud of how far she‚Äôs come. She still has anxiety but she is just the sweetest little doggo.
I was actually wondering the other day who it was based off and how proud the owner would be.
Much wow
Much wow. Such cute
This dog has single handedly brought many communities and people of all sorts together just by this single photo.
Kudos Shibe üå∏üå∏
The queen has returned!!!
This is my god
How does it feel owning one of the most influential animals on the entire internet?
Thank you for your service
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
The face of a movement
Protect this doge at all costs!
It's like watching the realistic adaptation of a disney animation.
Many age
thats a really unflattering picture
Such dog wow
SUCH CUTE VERY WOW 8D
How did that doggo turn into what doge is today?
I can't even register the creature in the first picture as a real dog anymore. It feels like s cartoon character.
All hail the queen!!!!
Such old, such cute
such wow
National treasure
What a good girl!
The goodest of girls
I don‚Äôt even see doge as a dog anymore, it‚Äôs like a person now
what a legend
The original doge photo is so surreal. Like I forget it‚Äôs not a photoshopped funny dog but an actual dog that exists and it wasn‚Äôt altered in any way.
Noooo, it's almost time for us to say goodbye to her :((
Old girl is such a beaut! Love her for all the glorious memes her face has been on!
Shes getting old, my gosh
im glad she's still alive and kickin
Memers unite under the dogecoin
I wonder if she's getting dogecoin royalties lol
Like in dog years or human bc Idk how long dogs live mb <3
15 that‚Äôs old. And a baby face to boot.
One of my favorite things to see on the internet is seeing what meme legends are doing now and what they look like years later. It's always really nice to see
Much time, such sadness, many moons üöÄ
Good doggo
She is the way!
That dog is literally royalty in my eyes.

She will forever be a constant inspiration and bring a smile to my face
Go Doge and ur cousin Litecoin! üêîüöÄ
Pride.
We should all pitch together and build a massive memorial statue in international waters.
and she shall be immortal.  no really, in a digital sense she might live forever
A doge with its own currency! ü™ô
How regal!
How it started / How it‚Äôs going.
Snap back to reality
Not going to lie but, she looks like she's hungover.

This little dog made me almost rich.
Much love. Such doge.
Is this edited to make her seem more sickly? The abc round is less colorful too.
Literally the most famous doggo in the world
The original is so surreal it doesn‚Äôt seem real anymore it‚Äôs just a currency

Doge at .69, this picture is at least 69 months ago. Half life 3 confirmed? I apologize in advance
I can't give more than one like someone help. This is clearly an error or travesty.
Saving this for a crypto bear market
My pup is 15 this year. She‚Äôs no meme but she is majestic. Seeing all the white on a pup makes me happy sad

Thank you Kabosu. For all the gains. You changed the world and lives of many. ü§ôüèΩ
What kinda dog is that?
Forever immortalized by being the face of dogecoin!
Enjoy retirement kabasu
The pictures look so different
God dammit, I‚Äôm old, fuck
fame , women and drugs have taken a toll on this guy
She will love forever as dogecoin becomes the currency of the people
All heil Doge
I've seen the original so many times it's oddly unrealistic, and seeing it being compared only makes it stronger.
Goooooood giiiirl
Good boy
wow such old very wise much beauty. She doesn't have much time left as shibes life span last at most 15 years. There's definitely some shibes that live longer than that but whatever happens for this good shoob will go down in internet history just as Gabe the dog went. To sweet pupper heaven!
Is this the founder of Dogecoin?
Its so surreal to doge as an actual dog and not as wacky character
Such old, wow
Kabosu wissen wer der Babo ist, immernoch der selbe Kabosu den du am Bahnhof triffst, wie er grade Nasen snifft

Dont do memes. Kids not onces.
It's almost like it's saying 

> Oh I was so young then...look how young I looked! Why did I waste all that time worrying about my looks?
[removed]
I have a Tshirt with her on it!
I wonder how much people will freak out that doge is a girl
Kabosu has a Crypto currency named after her
My heart crack!
Good doge
I'm not crying, you are. Damn we are old.
Actually the real doge dog died ages ago, this screenshot is at least 2 years old
one of the most famous shibas ever...
Wait-
Let's go in the garden
You'll find something waiting
Right there where you left it lying upside down
When you finally find it, you'll see how it's faded
The underside is lighter when you turn it around
They look like bread.
This dog has made people richer than the whole S&P 500 combined.
Do not let the dog die!
if you don't know how doge is pronounced usually you just say "Doge" but I personally say "Doge" and some others like to say "Doge".
Such age
Many wise
Legend.
Awwh I just purchased a bunch of share I believe in Dogecoin..
Wait only eight years ago? What?
Good doge
‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh god I thought it died, since it was a gray picture
What‚Äôs kabosu‚Äôs birthday?
I wonder how much dogecoin the owner has
Doge royalty
All hail the Dogemother!
Much sad, they‚Äôve grown so old over these years
Like Everyone else Her face too tells how much she is done with this 2019-2021 thing !
 Good old 2013 Days..
shes famous meme dog
Thank you Kabosu, you are making me rich.
What a feckin beeaaautyy
r/dogelore this seems about right
I love her!
I cant see that photo and my brain NOT tell me its photoshopped, just like the one with the shiba sitting. The origin photo is cursed at this point for me
1 doge always = 1 doge
Much wow
I'm just now realizing how fucking tragic it's going to be when this queen dies.
Little did she know she is going to the moon
Never has an animal made me this much money, thank you Kabosu, live long and prosper
She must be proud
Erect a shrine to this doge.
ü•∫ old doggies make my heart ache with such adoration and bittersweet love. Show me a sweet old doggie with a graying face and I'll collapse. Thank you for your beautiful silly face, Kabosu!
So doge coin will...
she looks dead inside
did you get any royalty for the picture :D :D
Awww. there's the big baby.  Hope you're doing well cutey!  =)
Still got it
Is that an unedited photo on the left?
Old girl
Ain't she beautiful
God bless her üôåüèº
Me too bud..... me too
WOW much beauty !
Doge is pronounced Doh-j ? Not Doggie üê∂
Seriously sounds better as Doogie and makes more sense ! What the hell is a Dohj
at this point the original picture looks photoshopped to me, its head was so overused that now it looks photoshopped because i can see the whole real body instead of drawings...

But that's still a cute doggo
She's worth 1 trillion woofers
Before lockdown vs after lockdown.
As beautiful as the days I laid eyes on her.
I love her so much. Good doge.
She‚Äôs still beautiful!
Beautiful
Masari coin worth taking a look at.
She‚Äôs a living legend that‚Äôs for sure ‚ù§Ô∏è
This dog deserves a sold $100k of your stupid doge coin does she not?
It‚Äôs like dogecoin 15 years later
Look what you started... I love you, whimsical pooch.
Doge wow!
*Everywhere at the end of time starts playing*
I would give my life for this funny yellow dog
I still can‚Äôt believe that that is an actual dog, for some reason the doge has always had a photoshop-y look to it. But still a beautiful dog
Fly high Kabosu

To a deluxe apartment on the moon in that DOGE sky

We finally got a piece of the pie
When she passes all us apes better pony up for the biggest send off of all time. May she live forever though!
That dog looks bit sad
omg she is sooooo cuteeee <3
Before getting into dogecoin and after
Thanks Dogo, papa making some money on that DOGE now!
I love her
The legend herself will carry us to greatness
If she does will doge die with her?
Time is undefeated üò¢üò¢
So you should own 1% of every coin
ITS QOUGE BABEY

Best fucking girl
Dam. Doge is the real good boy. To the moon dogecoin. $4.20.

Still a great looking meme pupper
She wouldn't have imagined that her image would be used in currency
Don't do meth kids.
I hate when people post this photo because she looks bad in it. She looks way better in every other current photo
Doge has own coin. Doge is like queen.
He is still the very same doggo. Embrace age and be thankful for it.
She looks so different. She not yellow anymore üòî
I love her ü§ç
I will always love DOGE
Such age, cute very still.
I just noticed the finger in the original photo lmao
She‚Äôs retired now.
This dog is a billionaire crypto meme!
And now, she's a billionaire.
Cute.
Ah so shes to blame
How much did she sell her meme for?
She better be seeing a cut from the doge coin
Still beautiful as ever!! üíõ

2021 better not take my dogggo
I hope the owner sells that as an nft for a shitpot full of quiche.
I though this dog had died ? It was posted on here a while ago , people were pressing F in the chat to pay respects .
Internet people, this is true royalty before us! Long live the Eternal doge. At least for a few more years hopefully.
That's auntie Kabosu to you.
