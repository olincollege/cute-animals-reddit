Your dog is a gentleman.  His canine manners are impeccable.  Cautious tail wagging at first, followed by a perfect play bow, and spin to demonstrate his intent.  

Dogs can actually talk.  You just have to learn how to listen
Oh so sweet to see the rotty engage at the end! Looks like a good start to a best friendship!
Play bows makes me so happy! They‚Äôre adorable and I could imagine pup saying ‚ÄúPlease please please play with me!!!‚Äù
My favorite part is everyone rushing over to watch this cherished moment

My poor sweet kitty cat does this to every animal she befriends, but none of them ever want to play with her. My boyfriend's dog was old and tired when she moved in, so she never wanted to play. A friend's cat always thought mine was being mean to him when she just wanted to play, so he just ran away from her all the time. I need to get her a buddy like these guys.
The rottweiler just had to do an ocular pat down, basic visual threat assessment.
This is adorable! What a pair of beautiful dogs you have!
I believe their characters are equivalent to Captain Holt and Jake Peralta. Even while having a straight face, he is playful with Jake.
I audibly gasped when the rottie did the play bow!!
He‚Äôs like, OK FINE!
This is so wonderful, a new friendship!!!
‚ÄúDid we just become best friends?‚Äù......
‚ÄùYup‚Äù.......
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go do karate in the garage‚Äù
Awww and it ends with a rotty butt wiggle!
Paws out, let‚Äôs bro out!
Our rottie, Mabel, was the goofiest, dumbest, silliest, lumbering sweetheart of a dog. She is missed.
Aw it made me so happy to see the Rottie playing at the end! Both of your dogs are beautiful
That was so good
They‚Äôre so cute!! I love rotties! Grew up with two sweeties.
The victory is the best part.
The butts!! Those are some happy puppies :)

The nubby wiggles
Breakthrough
God damn that ending was cute!
Got em! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
yay frens
I love how everyone got excited as well when he finally gave in
Something about this inspires me to try harder.
I was losing hope at first!  That ending made me so happy
I love when they do the downward facing dog thing with the waggy tails. It's so adorable.  My dog does it with my cats.  He also throws in a special higher pitched bark that is deadly if you have a migraine.  The cats love the whole routine. The male, a big Main Coon, starts the "catch me if you can" and takes off.
Now that's adorable
Goodbye all order and cleanliness in your house! -source, owned a Rotty, kitty and Pit mix who would chase and play endlessly.

Good times, RIP Atticus the Rotty.
In my experience, rotties play by steamrolling their playmates because they're furry tanks and don't understand their own strength
Ma this new guy don't know how to play
I adore this.
The sounds that I just made were quite inauspicious
I'm glad the Rotti decided to join in. My puppy keeps trying this with my kitties, but they don't wanna play like that.
The Rottweiler reminded me of myself...not being able to pick up on social cues like the socially awkward weirdo I am. I love the moment when he‚Äôs like ‚Äúoh you wanted to play‚Äù after the other dog had to repeat himself a few times. My spirit animal right there.
I love how everyone rushes to see them playing!!
Did we just become best friends?

Yep!

Wanna do karate in the garage?

Yep!
‚ÄúI‚Äôll try spinning, that‚Äôs a good trick!‚Äù
That's good doggo communication
Come on! I said come on, let‚Äôs gooo!!
I happy gasped when the rottweiler showed interest. This is adorable.
At the end, when he succeeded, I was like YES!
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen in my fucking life. And yes I‚Äôm high, but holy fuck.
He tried so hard to resist, but in the end it was all for naught
That one little tail wag! Adorable!!!
Oh man, those butt up in the air, front paw stretched out ground slaps are the best!
I love seeing different breeds together and how they react. Rotty is looking at (I'm guessing part Ridgeback or Austrian?) the other like "This is confusing. Do I chase you?"
The roti looks like a lil bunny üê∞ü•∞
Didn't take much convincing
Nothing could resist that for long
Success!! how cool that your dog is so very happy to have a buddy :)
Aww, that rotty said, 'fine, let's do this!'
‚ÄúDid we just become best friends!?‚Äù
I have a 15.5 yr Rottweiler she just got a tumor removed and is doing great! Enjoy having the most loyal and strongest dog at your side
That was wholesome as fuck I love them both
Blonde dog "c'mon wanna play?" Rotty "hmmm" blonde dog "c'mon wanna play, look at this." Rotty "hmmm" blonde dog " c'mon wanna play, its fun." Rotty "OK"
Omg I love rotties so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
"did we just become best friends"
I was so worried the Rottie was gonna leave the other one hanging! So precious. Love the little butt wiggle at the end.
/u/savevideo
"PLEEEEEAAAAAASE!!! CMOOOONNNN!!"
That‚Äôs so fucking cool
Love the ending.
Can we please get updates on this
Haha that playbow
He is telling the Rotty hey buy #doge #dogecoin
Success!
What a sweeties! 

they will be friends in no time
I could watch this all day
its like being convinced by your cousin to come oitside

Flat dog!!!!
That little tail wiggle at the end! :)
Yay success!

Ohh..dropped into play mode, play will commence lol
GODDAMN, Dogs are the best eh?
He did it!!!!!!!!
We‚Äôre gonna need updates on this friendship
"Eh listen bud I just started today... I'm not trying to really do anything too crazy"
He‚Äôs like come on man, play with me!
Aww that little pounce and wiggle at the end. ü•∞ü•∞
They'll be best friends in no time
I had a bad experience with Rottweilers so i was a little nervous at first but when it finally jumped in and gave a stubby tail wag, I was elated.
\*\* Oh so sweet to see the rotty engage at the end! Looks like a good start to a best friendship \*\*
Aww he‚Äôs like, cmon buddy! Let‚Äôs play! 

No seriously, let‚Äôs play!

Fr though, let‚Äôs play, see my play bow? I wanna play! Cmonnn, cmon! Cmon! Let‚Äôs play. Let‚Äôs play. You wanna play? Look at my bow! LETS PLAYYYYY
Little does he know that game is the Rottweilers favourite game
That play bow from the rottie at the end made me actually say out loud "and he's found his home now"
Play? Play? Play! Seems like it took the cute baby to get the play bow
Awww it worked üôÇ
Yaaay!!! I was hoping he'd join in the fun and he did.
Fox do a barrel role! Love it! I have a rottweiler and I am happy to see your doing well!
i thought he would not convince him, i‚Äôm glad he did
Was his name Kilo by chance? Looks like a 1 year old rottie I just saw up for adoption this week....

It's happening! It took awhile but it's happening!!
HAAAAARIYUKEN! üêïüêïüêïüçÉüçÉüçÉüçÉ

Yay! They‚Äôre going to be great friends.
this is so happy :)
It's gonna be a rowdy house for the next decade now, good times.
Ah there‚Äôs the play bow
Thanks for posting an awesome video that also show how you're closely supervising their interactions. Very responsible!
You did it! You got the play!
That made my day
Well thats the biggest aww i‚Äôve seen in a clip. Many thx
HI! I'M DOUG! I JUST MET YOU AND I'M YOUR NEW BEST FRIEND!
awesome wish yous the best, love atomic
I wish humans could make friends this easily. Just do a little hop, skip and a jump, maybe even a twirl and I‚Äôve got a new best bud. Heck yeah! So happy for your doggos! You‚Äôre awesome for adopting!
I love the classic dog move where they are like "Oh you don't want to play?  I'll just stand up.  SIKE!! We're playing.  Come on'
Congrats on getting a rottie! I love them and grew up with them. Great dogs. I bet he/she is thrilled to have a new family and playmate
**OMG THAT LITTLE TAIL WAGGING IS SO CUTE!**
I had to fast forward a 30 second clip cus I needed to know that they became friends
He's still acting hard after doing a bid.
This brings me such joy!! Hope to see more videos of this forever friendship!! ‚ô•Ô∏è
That little tail wiggle!!!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Awww
rotty.exe finally engaged
HE DID IT!!!
Well, if you twist my arm, lol!
EVERYONE LIKED THAT
Hahaha the moment that they both meet in downward dog.
When he finally gives in
I was starting to worry the Rottweiler wouldn‚Äôt respond phew
Rotties are such a dorks. I love this video
Did we just become best friends?!!
What a Beautiful Spirit your dog has. And he kindly and tenaciously tried and tried till he got the new furry guy to play with him.
Frozen like a PC waiting for windows updates to finish.
What breed is the ‚Äûnon-rottweiler‚Äú dog?
It's an old code but it checks out.
SPIN TO WIN!
What a good polite boy!!
Although every single dog is goodest but this boi is the most well built and well mannered dog I have seen in a long while. goodest level above 9000
Everyone is so correct! That play bow made ME wanta play with him !
Aww, this makes me miss my old rottie. His name was T-bone and he was a rottie/lab mix. The friendliest dog you'd ever hope to meet, which was a problem because he was also fuckin' biiiig. Like, you even look at him and his tail would start wagging like a baseball bat. We had to stop putting things on the coffee table because they'd get swept off. You let him get even a hint that you've got a treat and that tail could kneecap you.
Ahhh. Your Rotty is autistic! üòä
Took the rottie a minute to download and run the new program
Lol ‚Äúthis dog must be broken‚Äù
Cutest thing I've seen! Your dog is an absolute darling. So respectful and friendly!
What breed is the other dog(light)?
Huge success today (make it down).
my brother adopted a new dog and he was the one who wanted to play :D the older dog be like... nah i dont wanne play with newbies
Honey badger don‚Äôt care
Yeah! He succeeded!!!
What a super nice boy!
Rip to your home
This dog is jacked
10/10 would pet if allowed
When he play bowed back! <3
Aww, he did it!
Pretty brave adopting a full grown Rottweiler and introducing it to your other dog.
I wish I could enjoy this video but Bruh wtf is this new video player update on the iPhone Reddit app. It is COMPLETE GARBAGE! Why does it feel like it‚Äôs trying to be tik tok. Can‚Äôt hear audio even if unmuted unless phone is not on silent SMFH. T R A S H.
Trainer outlook: keep experience like these short so leave  them waiting more and END ON A HAPPY NOTE. Keep have short interactions that end up a happy note. Take them on walks together (each dog on separate leashes with two people to walk each one). But stop if one has reactive issues because other one could pick up his nasty habit. This 

Never leave them unsupervised out together for the at least the first year (but I personally would never left my dogs out together unsupervised at all).   I had a friend whose gf adopted a dog and brought him over to meet his. Meeting when great and they looked like best friend. Bf and gf left for a date and came back to his dog absolutely slaughtered. I helped clean it up and it was a horror scene.  

When adding a new adult dog to the pack that is also strong breed. Don't let them out together without  a people present that could physically break up a  fight . I have another story where it end with another dead dog and a missing finger tip. If anyone asks I'll share. Having a plan on how to break up dog fights never hurts (youtube has some great suggestions.  It also never hurts to feed in kennels seperately. 

I hope all goes well but having a plan never hurts.
rotty is like.. "ok, i does a play"
Too bad about his tail
u/savevideo
HMMMMMM, OK, YOU‚ÄôRE COOL, LET‚ÄôS PLAY!!
OMG, I love this, I wished my single doggo had a good buddy like that.
This put such a smile on my face!
Rotties are the coolest, best dogs. We've had four of them.
You should take him him to train carrige yard and see the magic..
YAY!!!!
The knub wiggle!!!! :D
So cute!
Awwww he figured it out at the end!!!
Success!
To see the excitement of you both and the Rottweiler to play brought warmth to my heart. And I don't think ive ever used that phrasing. Congratulations on this new journey!
This is what I live for
SO CUTE!
Brb, crying
I was happy to see it ended well!
Aww what a good boy/girl
That‚Äôs first play-bow! Love it!
Please keep us updated on your new puppers finding their groove! üíï
So dang cute!
Me trying to get my friends to play DRG...
That was SO cute! Heartwarming. Thanks for sharing this.
At the end he is like ‚Äúdid you.... just fucking twirl?!‚Äù
Awwww
"you play like this. Then like this. Then wait like this."
Oh, I was so upset that Rottie didn't seem to know how to play, but they got there in the end! Now my heart is happy.
better teach em how to use the john
Trying? You mean achieved! That was so adorable
Cute
So sweet!!!!!
Aww I'm so glad they played! At first I was worried.
I cheered out loud when the rottweiler finally agreed to play!
The beginning reminded me of that interrogation video of the serial killer who didn't move for an hour
Aww at the end I was like yay!
Dogs are the best.
Rottweiler was asserting his dominance haha
Got him!
Awe I love it. BFF‚Äôs
Happy ending!!!!
Haha as I'm watching I keep thinking the other dog is doing things and when the rottie joins, he's like yeah! Made you laugh!
Be careful because those stances look like two very, very happy doggos!
It worked! Our rescue tried to get our older German shepherd to play for two weeks and she finally gave in!
this is so adorable! our dog does the dame thing
When you're an introvert and an extrovert friend adopts you
What kind of dog is that trying to play? Looks exactly like mine and we don‚Äôt know what he is.
Oh my goodness that is adorable!!!!!
My BF has a Rottie. He scared the crap out of me at first but now we are best buds. Rotties are the best!!!
That dog has got the ‚Äúplay with me‚Äù rules of engagement down to a Science. Disney should model this dog into CG.
That's so cute.
I bet that big meat baby shakes the whole house.
PLAY,PLAY!
Omg I‚Äôm so glad he succeeded
It worked!
LMAO IT WORKED!!!
We need to see how this progresses!!
Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.
Soon to be best friends forever. Thanks for sharing!
Keep it together

I would say that looks like the beginning of a beautiful relationship! üëçü•∞
Our Chihuahua mix puppy is trying so hard to play with our 16 year old Schnauzer mix. He's a grumpy old thing, but he's coming around.

I think that's Bolt, from the movie
The butt wiggle at the end!  Oh, my heart!
So glad that it worked!
Nice
Dogs are awesome. Its always nice to see them get along so well and easily. We can learn a lot from an animal.
He was just charging up
/u/stee4vendetta it‚Äôs just like Luna and Ellie!
He‚Äôs doing a good job!
He's got basenji in him! I can see it in his eyes and face
We will be best friends. I just know it.
Soooo cute!
And thus the story of how two puppers became the bat pals in the whole wide world begins
I cannot tell you how happy I felt when the Rottweiler joined it!
SUCCESS!
The bow is the invitation to play.
The suspense was killing me! That play bow is so adorable. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
Or he has a very well choreographed dog dance that I hope we get to see.
So sweet! 

Come! Come play! Come play with me!

....

Come on!

....   Okay! Let's  GOOOOOO!

Playtime ensues, everybody celebrates by quoting the last line of Casablanca.
Mission accomplished!
I fucking love dogs.

Quality r/maybemaybemaybe action.

So glad the Rott joined in!
we had 3 long coated german shepherds.  they would play fight for hours in the backyard.  people would stop their cars and watch them.
It reminds me of the scene where Kiara try to Get Kovu to play with her for the first time. "TAG! YOU'RE IT!"
I imagine that when they get going, it's like TWO bulls in a China shop!
Your dog looks very much like my dog. 

https://imgur.com/gallery/UFqaHk6
I feel like dogs have a tendency to try to form friendships with other dogs.  
cats somewhat lack that friendly nature.

tell me if i'm right/wrong .
Such a friendly welcome!!!!
DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS... YUP
Rottweilers just need time to think. A long time.
I love a story with a happy ending. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
I love them.
Okay this one got me: i was sitting over here blase as fuck. "Dude, you should play."

"Oh shit big boi is playin"
I had a dog like yours. Adopted in end of 2009 from a rescued litter. Looked like Belgian shepherd mix. Unfortunately, he died suddenly, six years ago, possibly from some cardiovascular event.
I want a rottie so bad :(
Aaaaah when he finally does the paws!!!! I would watch them play all dayyyyy
Success!
More! I need more of this!
4th ‚Äúplay bow‚Äù was a charm!

Play is so universal in social animals. I love it.
That's adorable!
So much tension, is he (she), she (he). Then finally yes. Good dogs.
He succeeded!
Bro I had so much anxiety that the Rottweiler wouldn't play with the other dog I was like so help me if he don't play with him then I will
He did it! The son of a bitch did it!
You see it takes the Rotti a while to assess what place he‚Äôs in and to drop his guard
Well that is absolutely out of this world adorable.
Omg this is so cute!
Finally cracked!
Sweetest bro welcome ever!
Omg love them! I have a 110 lb Rottweiler laying on my feet right now snoring. ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôll show you around, come on, come on!! Man that‚Äôs cute
So cute
I feel we need more proof of playing please.
The other dog is chunky and cute
He kept at it! And it paid off!

I love how expressionate the ears are <3
The video ends when the Rotty ate him off-camera
Dogs are fucking pure perfect creatures
I learned to love and trust animals first. I never feel like a dog is lying to me. Every movement, every ear wiggle, is real. I've heard you can trust and respect people that way too.
I'm glad you guys were able to find such a gentle dog that just wants to live. To many times in my life have I seen people who adopt rescue dogs that can't be around other animals till a rehabilitation period due to previous owners
Can we get an update of them playing, please?
Omg your dog looks like a larger version of my dog!!! What breed is he/she?
Cool
Very Funny
Success!
Awww. We‚Äôre fostering a 7 month old puppy and our other dog was not at all amused by her. He‚Äôs finally coming around though.

Looks like me and my sister
I'd watch this movie.
Aww, new besties(‚âß‚ñΩ‚â¶)
Yes, the spin hypnosis.
Does Denis Savard Spinarama work on human female's? Does anyone know? I'm fresh out of idea's and what I'm doing now(hiding so as not to have to again experience the agony of rejection) doesn't seem to be very effective. Any tips?
He did it!!!!!!!! Yay!!!!
Man, this brought back memories of me playing with my old lab. If I got down low on hands and knees she'd love it. Then to really have fun I'd put on oven mitts and she knew we could bite/wrestle a little more on those. I miss her, was a great 16 years. Thank you for sharing this
How cool!

There it is.. how fun! They are friends

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna play. I don‚Äôt wanna play. I DON‚ÄôT WANNA ‚Äî HA just fucking with you let‚Äôs do this.‚Äù
Fast friends! I think he hesitated that long because he couldn't see the tail wagging.
‚Äúalright man, let‚Äôs do it‚Äù
What a nice Doge...
"why sooo serious"
If only humans could do this more often!
It's so good to see dogs come out of their timid shell and be a dog.
Lol it looks like he is getting the playtime he wants:)

Success, at last!
When the extroverted kid keeps asking the introverted kid to play and the introverted kid gives in

Yay!! Loved it at the end when the rott joined in. Looks like they're gonna get on just fine.
What a polite little play bow!!
I only needed to see the body language to see a friendship was forming
It‚Äôs like watching the dog version of lion king 2
We require updates please!

Love it!
Awww he‚Äôs like c‚Äômon!!! Play??
Mission Accomplished!
Rott was like "Don't make me do it, goddamnit."
Got him!
By random chance... do you happen to live in Toledo Bend, Louisiana? That looks exactly like my grandmothers house
Awesome that made me smile!
It‚Äôs good to be out of that sweaty, old box.
Chop aint having shit
Haha stage fright
Rotty standing there like "you call those zoomies? Pathetic.... ok getting better.... ZOOOM ZOOM ZOOOM!"
He's like, Bich uh want thisüòÇüòÇ
It worked...
Ok this is so heartwarming I might cry
That is a good good boy. I hope you and them are happy.
Dogs have the best culture
Awwwwwwwww they got there in the end
My instant thought was quick! Get em in the garden, zoomies about to take off!
Oh I love rottie butt wiggles
What sweethearts
There is an animal behaviorist that decoded all the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs play‚Äù moves in slow motion.  Pretty interesting stuff.
Looks like it worked :-)
*so* ***CUTTTTTTTTEEEEE!!!!***
Adorable the rotty finally got the play message and the little tail wags at the end.
Absolutely, You‚Äôre Rotty will come around.  I‚Äôm so glad you were able to get dear creature.
Deep down, all dogs can derp. Glad to see great beginnings to a derp filled friendship.
"bro why are you so serious you look like this"

**postures up and looks serious**

**does spin move**  
"lets play dawg"
The best part is when the humans get excited
I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm laughing or crying
Awwww very nice dogs
"Then they have sex and live happily ever after"
Your dog moves like an adorable cartoon dog
After having dogs all my life I only recently learned the importance of a dogs bow when playing. Apparently dogs in packs (and even communities where they walk locally) can get a bad reputation if they bow and still play too rough and other dogs will actively avoid them. And that fake sneeze your dog does when you're playing, he/she is saying 'whatever you do now is playtime and I am ALL IN'
Rotties are amazing!!
Confused at first, then ok lets play
aww what a cute start
Awwww, such a good brother!
What breed is it !!?
I sooooo want to see more of this!! What happened for the rest of the day?!? Made me smile for sure
Oh to see them become friends üòç

So cute
How i act when I get excited and my group is like, why are you high Bro?
I am not high, I am excited and am angy what you aren't.
u/Hperry6760, I'm curious what breed your dog is? We have a four year old dog who looks very similar, only smaller.
You did it. The crazy son of a bitch, you did it!
New dog is intrigued by the proposal to play.
house is way to small for those 2 shit droppers
They did it!
DID WE JUST BECOME BEST FRIENDS?
I said Aww our loud so this subreddit rocks
It worked!
üé∂ Thiiis is howww we dooooo it üé∂
Not a dog expert but I saw in a documentary their body language submitting each other is an invitation to powerplay with no harm intentions, which the second dog accepts and comfirms
What breed is your dog?
That rottweiler was looking at him like Mac and Dennis looked at Wally when they moved to the suburbs
Yay!!!!
Well done my friend.  Mission accomplished üê∂
Drunk me at 2am suddenly shouting "Oh, he Got'em!"
They‚Äôre speaking all the right language to each other and it‚Äôs so sweet üòä

That little nub tail wiggle at the end!  üòç
Omg i wanna know more about these guys
What kind of dog is you other dog?
I have 2 rotties and it looks the same. The athletic one begging her to play exactly like that
SUCCESS!!!
I knew puppets going to succeed!
Persistence pays off.
Lol this video shows your dog trying every trick in the doggo play manual. What an awesome dude, I hope they figure it out
‚ÄúI‚Äôm a stone cold killer I don‚Äôt play.

I‚Äôm a stone cold killer I don‚Äôt play.

I‚Äôm a...oh never mind. Let‚Äôs play!‚Äù
Awww I‚Äôm in love with that dog from earth to the moon
Great success!
 He wants to play !!
"Listen up pally... this is my home, and you... you are my bestie now, see...its just what it is dawg..."

"Its dog"

"No dog its dawg...dawg."

"D...O....G"

"Besides dawg we are besties now... so *spins majesticly* lets hekin play!"

"Play what?"

"Dads got some new slippers we can chew up"

"LETS HEKIN GO DAWG!"
My vizsla acts just like that to other friendly dogs.  So far haven't found any that have been able to wear him out.  
He's just getting warmed up and they're all pooped!
Success!
Trying? That's succeeding!
I‚Äôve never felt such a surge of dopamine before when I saw the Rottie finally start playing
We had an old rescue whippet X Labrador then started puppy walking for Dogs For the Disabled, our puppy would just stand in the old dog's way and bark continuously until he played! This is much more polite
I hope they are best buddies by now!
Aww, dogs are so sweet!
My day is better now, ghanks good boys/girls/any pronoun you prefer to use
Done like a true doggie diplomat
In my hood you get booped for that
Dog: [_cracks knuckles_] check out these moves, boyh
When the rottie finally drops it down for a bow üíóüíóüíó
Please tell me I wasn't the only one to scream with joy when the Rottweiler joined in lol
We all need to play less seriously, learn more playfully.
Doge is jealous.
What are they going to play checkers?
Succeeding not trying!
Aweeee

How do dogs know when they want to be friends? I feel like one the street they always want to fight
Aw!!!! That is so cute.
It's just like that scene in Lion King 2. even their colors match!
I loved this!! I honestly thought the rotti wasn't going to budge, zo happy he did though
Yes!!! He suceeded!
Seems like rottweiler haven't had opportunity play with other dogs in it's past.
See he did it 
Good for you little guy
Why do they still cut their tails?
Persistence is key üëåüèæ
Very welcoming!
That lil rottie booty
Isn't it the best? We got a 1yo dog when my female was 1.5 and they were playing within 10 minutes. Now it's been 2 years and they play together all the time!
Victory! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
 Aw what lovely doggos
Always see dogs do the spin amd front legs down, do you think this is a universal game all dogs know like we all know tag or hide and seek?
I remember my neighbour's dog doing that with my socially awkward rescue dog. Initially she looked at him as though he was mad and the next thing we knew they were bouncing around the garden like kangaroos. They stayed friends all their long lives too.
Man, I‚Äôve wanted a Rottweiler my entire life.
The Play Bow has been accepted.
What a gentlemen
He succeeded yay!!
‚ù§Ô∏èüêæ
Dogs are so good.
I have a rottweiler and 5 little dogs.  They all get along and love each other.  The rottie is the best dog ever!
It‚Äôs like Lion King 2!!! You got yourselves a Kovu!!
I almost disliked by acident ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Doggo: 'Why so serious??' Bow, 'Just joking, ok chase me!'
 'Ok, now, chase...  hm now?'
Dog: 'Uh, ok'
Doggo: 'Yeah, let's play!'
When their paws are down and but up you‚Äôre half way there. Looks like love at first sight...
So adorable!
Success at last
He did it!
So adorable

Just aDOGable  ü•∞

Rotties are all fun and games till they sit on you and impale you with there nub
Reminds me of the past four years.
Your dog moves like a Pixar dog and I love it.
When the Rotty started playing at the end, I swear to god I teared up. I felt like I had been watching this for years, and finally saw it come to fruition.

Sincerely,

A 35 Year Old Man in Round Rock, Texas
I feel bad that someone cut the dogs tail. :(
The wagging bobtail is my favorite üòÇ
Just play with him damnit
This made me so sad at first thinking, 'oh no, doggo is trying so hard and other doggo isn't going to play with him'. Then he joined in and I am happy.
Are those piss droplets on the ground
The floor is filthy and they‚Äôre walking around in socks and bare feet. I can‚Äôt watch this
I naivly thought it is going to be a human kid.
People who get tails clipped are assholes
Very cute. Shame about the docked tail though.
As much as I know that docking tails is no good, as a fellow owner of a nubby rottie, I love the nub
did u crop their ears :(
Rottweilers are loaded guns.
Can‚Äôt believe some shithead clipped his tail

[I don‚Äôt know who this guy is](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mac-and-dennis1.jpg)
The smell of feet in this video is god awful.
This is cute. 

I still feel like they all celebrated way too hard. People use to only be impressed when a dog did tricks with the owner, compared to how people gather around to just pet a dog. 
I don't Get The Canine sub fetish.
I'm sorry but did you cut the Rottweiler's tail off
[removed]
I don't mean to damper the mood, but is anyone else terrified that this playfulness will get out of hand and turn into a vicious dog fight?

I have a very jealous GSD who will turn on my other dogs if they receive more attention than her. Things get pretty bloody sometimes and we have to separate them for days. Seems like everybody's pets just get along on Reddit sometimes.
