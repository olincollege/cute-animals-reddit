Holy fuck wolves are huge.
Just imagine the first dude who decided wolves would make good pets.
imagine getting chihuahuas from this majestic beast
The belly exposure!!! That wolf loves this person.
I'm always skeptical when I see wolves acting friendly towards humans... and then I remember that is literally how we got dogs.

Mandatory "Don't try this yourself."
I often forget how big those fuckers are, I'd hate to come across one in the wild.
I always pictured them being basically the same size as huskies... holy shit
Humans are so aggressively social, we see these massive apex predators and think ‚ÄúBIG BOI! I wonder if I can pet it?‚Äù. And the wolves see us and think ‚ÄúThem! I wonder if they‚Äôll pet me?‚Äù
Meanwhile my 70lb lab&american bulldog is currently curled up in his sweater, his head on a pillow and partially under a blanket...
This wolf is very big...it s a common one ?
I'M FIERCE HUNTER HUMAN, BEWARE!

Oh wait. Is that mommy?

I no eat. Belly rubs please!
Majestic AF!

Are all wolfy bois this big? Gorgeous
Wolves are big, then why do they make them look like coyotes in werewolf movies...like boi
Big Wild Doggo üêï
I‚Äôm gonna tell my kids this is how Game of Thrones ended.
Didn‚Äôt become good boy. Was always good boy
Motherfucker that's a dire wolf
r/killthecameraman
Now that's a big boy
I like wolves less for how gorgeous they look, although that is a bonus, and more for how amazing of an apex predator they are both in groups and solo.

There's nothing really aww about it, it's fairly violent, but it is amazing how well they do it. I'm an even bigger fan of their cousin coyotes who are even more adaptable. 

I highly recommend the Yellowstone documentary.

Edit: Sorry it was super popular when it came out but I forgot it's name. I'm pretty sure it was She Wolf which is on YouTube now.
I'd love to pet a wolf that's fine around humans. But if I ever saw one in the wild I'd be as terrified of it as I would be if it were a starving lion. As we all should.
Well that's a big boy if I ever saw one
This is the cutest fucking thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Are you implying he isnt always a good boy?
My heart exploded when he showed his belly to her! So much trust.
longer version with sound: [https://youtu.be/fXDPacET4cU](https://youtu.be/fXDPacET4cU)
I always wonder if the name ‚Äòwolf‚Äô was something we just stuck with that our ancestors named them. It would make sense, since it‚Äôs more or less the sound that they make. Which begs the question....

Are wolves the first irl Pokemon?
Deleted?
Link is dead.  Mirror?
Why the fuck would someone delete this?
forbidden :(
The level of trust is about maximum, to the point that he shows his belly to her, his most vulnerable part, a thing that he probably won't do to any other creature.
Dogs are so much better than cats
PSA: wolves are still wolves people, don't try this at home. Thing could still eat your face at any time
Why is the link down?
Wolfs are still as lovable as dogs
Best home security ever... Pure fear!
Rub my belly! Lol
good boy Sif
Link down, Mirror please <3
Why would they delete the gif
Getting Page Not Found. Someone took it down? Time to downvote back into obscurity.

EDIT: Actually, looks like something is up with gfycat. A lot of links to it on reddit are going to Page Not Found.
Absolute unit wanting absolute belly rub
Holy shit! Never realized wolves were that large in size
wtf, wolves are HUGE
He is HUGE, wouldn't want to walk into him on a Winters night.... Unless it was for scritches
This is one of my good friends from college Danielle she‚Äôs a sweetheart
Big woofer
The first humans to befriend these creatures were badass
For the record that's a timber wolf. The biggest northern variety of the grey wolf. Most are not that big. Also she is a tiny person.
Why couldn't Jon Snow do this ??
I wonder if wolves poop like dogs. Like they need someone to be there to watch over them so they don't feel exposed.
That's some insane next level trust
Legosi irl
I'm always leery about these wolf videos ever since that one where the wolf was vigorously licking the inside of that woman's mouth and she was, like, totally down with it.
Well the gif wont load and I'm sad
Aw. The photo is gone now.
Anybody got a mirror ?
Page not found lol nice
The link appears to not work...

**EDIT:** Okay, it seems that gfycat is down... can't wait to see this when the site is back up!

Edit 2, electric boogaloo: sites back, yay!
i want that floof
Christ. I remember the post about the giant wolf, and seeing people say that it was massively overstated on size, but then there's this, where it's in motion and can't be called to question. Wolves are fucking massive.
I didn't know I needed this, but I did. Thanks! ‚ù§

Wolves will probably be what kills me in nature. My doggo needs pets auto-response is very powerful. Good for Corgis, bad for wolves.
Is there a way to double upvote.
Holy shit this is adorable.
 that's one of the most beautiful things I've seen in my life and people always think they're bad when they trying to do is survive like everyone else but that was so nice of what you people did and then actually get to be right around them big beautiful wolvesüëçüëçüëç
That's a huge wolf ...
You can see the love in his eyes ü•∫
r/bigboye
Omg when the wolf rolled over like a dog
It‚Äôs all about imprinting on them from birth.   Wolfs, and to the same extent Dogs, will accept just about any animal as ‚Äòfamily‚Äô if they are raised with or alongside them.   Once they are adults, it‚Äôs not that simple anymore, especially so with wild Wolves.
HE IS HUGE BOII!
And then he ate her.
This is the kind of heartwarming thing I need to see when I wake up. Gonna go pet my tiny wolf now.
Luckiest woman ever.
I wouldn't want to meet one in the wild, but what beautiful and majestic creatures
Wow that wolf trusts her to be on his back like that. And ughh I wish that was my life I love wolves.
I do not want to cross one of these massive beasts in the wild. They have been virtually eradicated in California up until a few years ago... never had to worry about it lol.
Fun fact, Wolves all protein diet means they don't get bad breath.  The Carbs in dog food is essentially why your dogs breath can smell like terrible ass.
Wow I didn‚Äôt expect it to roll over on to it‚Äôs back and expose it‚Äôs belly they never do that unless they feel safe or REALLY trust someone or something so the fact that they trust her that much is suprising
‚ÄúI bet you a $1000 I can rub that wolf‚Äôs belly‚Äù

Poor fool: ‚ÄúHa! You‚Äôre on!‚Äù

*Becomes a millionaire*
Feeling cute today. Might slaughter some deer later idk.
Your average joe should not attempt this at home however as it will likely result in injury
I love it
I don‚Äôt know anything about wolves. If you raised one from birth, would it be safe to be around? Or is there some inherent risk that could make it attack you due to some animal instinct? Idk if I would even trust one if i raised it.
Are they that fucking big?!?
Sometimes you forget how big wolves are, and then you realize why people were so afraid of them. Beautiful creatures though.
He does the same drop that my dog does! The slightest sign of affection and WHAM, on her back, legs in the air.
Plops down legs up= universal sign for belly rubs
Fuck me that's massive!
BTW people DON'T PET WOLVES.
Yeah, wolves and hyenas are huge. 

My favorite hyena-human pic:  [https://africageographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nigerian-traveling-circus-3.jpg](https://africageographic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nigerian-traveling-circus-3.jpg)
Beautiful clip. I see two awesome souls in it.
Holy fuck no one made a game of thrones reference yet?
I'm gonna tell my kids this is how Game of Thrones ended
I am insanely jealous
This is adorable and amazing!
When the dire wolves from game of thrones are just normal grey wolves
[deleted]
Aww it's like having a huge puppy.
My 20 pound terrier has given me some pretty good claw marks over the years from when she gets playful. I would not want this to get playful with me.
I'm a little gobsmacked at how that wolf's body language exactly matches one of my dog's when I pet and cuddle with her.

I mean, yea, I know my dog is descended from a wolf but she's a dog and that animal is an enormous wild animal.
How much does that beast weigh?
So i know the phrase "a cat's a cat no matter the size" when showing how similar in mentality a house cat is to a lion, cougar, etc.

Can the same be said of canines?
Can I have one in my home?

Such an adorable wolfie :)
Those paws
It looks like the wolf is still accepting the human as more "alpha" than him, if I'm not mistaken. Would this still be the case if the wolf had become the leader of his pack or would he feel threatened in his authority by the humans presence? Or would he just see the human as a visiting friend?
Do you want your descendants to be pugs? Because this is how you end up having your descendants be pugs.
It's amazing. My German Shepherd does the exact same thing. Movements, the look back on the butt scratch, the "why'd you stop scratching look" then flop to the side... nuts
Do you want dogs?! Because this is how you get dogs!
You can see him slowly morph from wolf to dog.
I didnt realize how big wolves are holy moly
I‚Äôm a simple east coast city boy so I may sound stupid here but... HOLY FUCK WOLVES ARE HUGE

r/PetTheDamnWolf
The world needs more of this
What a majestic and beautiful creature. Wolves are so incredible.
I‚Äôve been listening to a history book about France and at one point it‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhen famine struck in small towns the peasants were more vulnerable to bandits and attacks from nearby hungry wolves‚Äù and that was the first time I realized that in recent history people would be hunted by these things and it‚Äôs terrifying.
Omg what a huge good boy
Jesus H Christ I always forget just how fucking MASSIVE wolves are. And unfortunately in my area of Texas, the coyotes are getting almost to this size and are no longer afraid of humans. Normally they‚Äôd book it on first sight, but now they just stare you down like ‚Äúyeah bitch DO SOMETHING.‚Äù They eat pets all the time as well. :( Texas can be fucking scary sometimes...
The biggest good boy in the canine kingdom
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop petting!!‚Äù
Aw, the gif isn't working for me. Error "403 forbidden" :(
The Ghost ending we all needed.
Please, lets do all we can to preserve this earth. There are so many extraordinary creatures on this planet. Even if we would find someday extraterrestial life, I am sure it will not be as awesome as earth.
r/bigboye
Error 403, wow cute af
I love the body language of the wolf. He's so aware of her and tries to give her enough space while still trying to also look non threatening. Ears relaxed and back, snout pointing down and eyes small and relaxed. He's also trying to no look at her directly in the eyes, he clearly respects her too much to try anything. Not to mention the rolling over and showing the belly, not really for pets but for respect. This is amazing to watch. I just wonder how she managed when the wolves grew up enough to start rough playing and going against human authority
I want big floof
" I am lorge but I still need belly rubs "
FORBIDDEN to see a good boy??? Well I never....
In the words of Vulcan...I would like to pet this creature...
He was already a good boy.
Holy crap, I had no real concept of just how huge grey wolves actually are until this gif. I'm terrified and simultaneously in awe of their majestic beauty.
He looked like he‚Äôs smiling and embarrassed by all the attention. This is so awesomely cute!!
ah i love 403 FORBIDDEN NGINX
Every time I see a video like this, I think of the woman who ran a wolf sanctuary and was playing with a couple of wolves who were acting like happy puppies. One of them scratched her face accidentally while playing and she turns to the camera with this big bloody slash in her face and goes "People often forget they aren't dogs and can do this stuff." Like she was giving off some profound advice. You mean what you literally did because you're so use to them? Yeah, we all figured that out some time ago ourselves. 

And I dont know why I think this every. Single. Time. I see a wolf video.
For anyone in Florida wanting a taste of the goodboye scritches there‚Äôs a place called the Seacrest Wolf Preserve
This is what happens a couple million years ago, then they became tiny bois unable to climb steps and get on beds
My dog is in the ICU right now, so I‚Äôm pretty down and this really, really puta a smile on my face! Thank you so much for this OP!
I would like one wolfie please
The goodest boy
Never realized wolves look like giants...
It's hard to imagine this dog tearing into an animals flank
This is so far best scale of size I've seen of the grey wolf
15/10 would probably try to give pets if I wouldn't get my face eaten off
At 47 years old, TIL how big wolves are.
Wolves are enormous!
I'm gonna say it..... I'm gonna say it....

**UwU**
Untill it smells the menstruation like Brick said.
"That's not possible. there are no direwolfs south of the wall"
That is a lot of trust that killing machine is putting in her.

Goes from majestic creature to fluffy boy in two seconds.
The good old 403 Forbidden wolf.
#The North Remembers
HUGE
And today I learned the size of a Grey Wolf
I shit on my pants just watching this lady petting  a fucking wolf
To think one caveman was like "I'm pretty sure that boy is good" and the rest is history.
I know wolves are super dangerous but him rolling over and showing his belly has gotta mean something right? Animals only do that to show their submissiveness and aren‚Äôt capable of lying so is this wolf safe to be around then?
wolves are just giant huskies omg, the way it demanded a belly rub im cryingggg
I mean, that's one way for it to play out. Another is that the female keeper gets eaten by the wolf(ves) which is what happened in a case I was part of  investigating in Sweden a few years back.

Wild animals, predictably unpredictable...
I have never been more jealous in my entire life.
I love when 403 is forbidden!
Grey wolf: I am a pure bred killing machine, I will tear any creature apar.....ohhhhh...belly rubs
403 Forbidden  
NIGX
I had no idea wolfs were that big
I saved and unsaved because I really wanted to make sure it was saved.  Resaved fyi
Wolves are like the Greek gods of dogs. I‚Äôd be honored just to sit by one like this. It‚Äôs funny though seeing him roll over and want belly rubs. Dogs get it from somewhere obviously!
His heart, his ginormous beautiful flooofy heart.
Every time I see posts like this I'm just reminded there is a better way for humans and animals to coexist
I have an akita I raised and I still get nervous. This girls got some balls
Do wolves really retain memory that long? Also I'm pretty sure the appearances of the human would've changed enough over the course of a few years that the wolf would not have recognized her, right? I'm not 100% sure but I don't think this could happen
5% downvoted... Which I find so sad. Can the people who downvote these posts pls explain why?
Oh my god, he is acting EXACTLY like my dog does. That's so cute!
The goodest biggest boy
At some point in human history, some person looked at one of these beasts and said, you know i bet we could tame them and make them do stuff for us
Don't know if a really great gray wolf or a really tiny human
Thassa big boye
Forgive me but it isn't it dangerous to teach wild animals such as these to get too conformable with humans?
Or is that just for bears?
It‚Äôs a XXL husky
At the end of the day canines life this wolf are much more sociable than cats
He is just very big floofer
They just want love too
He is so cute!!! And large! I want one lol
Wolves are just like other puppers...just bigger <3
Whata good boi üòç
Was this recorded by a potato through a telescope?
Holy shit, I didn‚Äôt know wolves were fucking Saint Bernards!!!!
Big puppy
[The video of a person filming from inside the car on a cold, windy , dark night, and out of no where a black wolf comes out and walks across the road gives me the chills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBRXIbdZD04). Wolfs are big
I wish I could see one of these up close, in a controlled setting. They look absolutely huge, but at the same time it's always women next to them so I don't know if they're just tiny girls or what
Majestic creature.
OMG I didn't know wolves were so big.
I'll take 10.
Such beauty
I always forget how big they are. I had the opportunity to touch two once. I was walking into a hotel in the mountains and there were two young timber wolf ambassadors there to show to the kids. Some kind of program. Anyway, as I was walking in, they were trotting out to go back in the truck. They walked right past me, and I put my hand out at my side as I was walking and pet both from ear to tail. I had to raise my hand to get them. big, beautiful animals.
Majestic good boy
He is so happy to see her
"I'm big strong wolf now, I don't need your cuddles, I'm not a baby I have my own family and everything"

...

"AWW DAMN IT who are we kidding?? Give me all the belly rubs!"
Those pets are great and all but..... belly rub?
Weird lol this person definately used to be my neighbor. crazy seeing this here
Always stunned how big wolves are.
That lady gets to give a giant wolf belly scratches.
so what happens if you don't let them lick your mouth ? :D
(reffering the source video in comments)
And this is how we got dogs
Wow what a big puppy.
Oh whose a good boy
the secret is to just scratch that spot above the tail.
Stop it, stop it, it's fine, i will destroy you. 

https://youtu.be/JU94q9xoMr8
Know from a guy that trains wolves that wolves usually don't attack humans, they run away from it. They also are not aggressive.
Wow what a beautiful animal. I‚Äôm in awe of how big it is!
r/WolvesAreBigYo
Did anybody else think the wolf took a pink shit for a split second when first watching?
This is incredible to see
Mom can we get a wolf?
Puppies are puppies

Nobody how big or dangerous
Seeing how close he can get his butthole to her face...just like my cat...
Ok, She has to have one of the arguably best jobs in the world.
So beautiful üê∫üíú
Wolves are just dogs that live for themselves.
His paw is the size of her face
Imagine the feeling of being able to get even remotely close to this truly magnificent creature without feeling threatened. 


Then imagine as this beast rolls over, turning into the biggest floofer asking for belly rubs <3
We are so use to seeing "dogs" as small pets that we forget how GIANT wolves are!
r/bigboye
Why do I want wolf as a pet?
TIL wolves also like butt scritch
r/bigboye
Does anyone else really want to pet a wolf now and give it belly scratches?
I fucking wish. that's really all I can say
I know wolves are huge but *look at that paw!* It's as big as my hand!

Big wolf boy like butt scratches and belly rubs!
Everyone else here on the trampoline agrees that this is some fine camera work.
If only they got bigger, I'd ride one like a horse!  That didn't sound right, but I said it!
My dog does that to me every morning. He loves his belly rubs. Now I know where it comes from.
wow! incredible to see a wild animal so affectionate with humans. turned into a big ol' puppy!!
Rub the belly!!!
That‚Äôs one big danger dog

Makes me sad to think of how many wolves out there fo without belly rubs.
Damm, I thought my firend's husky was big
üò≥ Wowww, gorgeous animal üê∫‚ù§
BUBBBYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
I HAD NO IDEA THEY ARE THAT GIANT?!?!?!
Even apex predators love belly scritches
Idk how I'd feel about being that close to something that can pull me into pieces in seconds.
Had no idea they are that big
I pitty anyone that trys to fuck with her when that wolf is around
He's so fluffy!!!
My Mom had this little tiny miniature black poodle. Cute AF 

 It's mind boggling to me that it was a descendant of this. 

In the wolf's defense that little tiny poodle was way too smart and brave for it's own good
beautiful wolf

I want one
English isn't my first language but I have a question.. is it grey or gray???
Even big Boyes, are goodboyes.
I know that‚Äôs a giant apex predator....but I wanna cuddle it.
.. and then he ate them.
Aren‚Äôt you supposed to avoid eye contact with wolves.?
Sven
That is so badass but I wonder if they go up to random people.  Must be terrifying to see this thing happily lumbering towards you for some pets.
I love the fact that the wolf trusts the woman so much that it exposes it's belly to her for scritches.. I have read somewhere that if a dog exposes it's belly and lays on it's back to you then it means it trusts you a lot. This is so wholesome.
That is a huge wolf!! Beautiful.
Hmmm Big wolf or tiny woman...?
Even original dogos like belly rubs
Wolfo seems impossibly huge! It's like LOTR when Gandalf and Frodo are in the same wagon but it's cinema trickery and Frodo is actually 6 feet behind Gandalf.
What kind of bear is this
Princess Mononoke
Quick,  everyone go get a husky because it sort of looks like a wolf! Oh, and Disney has a new wolf movie, so get two! Don't worry about backyard breeders,  they care!
Started out as a lady about to clean some anal glands in her pink gloves, then ended with a sigh of relief that it was just another good boi moment.
Darn that wolf is so fluffy and cute! But it also looks scary!
A Staffy bit my cheek about a month ago. Not aggressively. But I'll be scarred for life. Bled like a motherfucker with very little contact/force from the dog. 

Anyways. It's face was like 1/3 the size of this.
Wolves are better than I expected
GD that‚Äôs a bigin
Beautiful creature.................the wolf's not bad either
It‚Äôs so big!
Big ol teddy bear
Love this.  Saving to view when I am feeling down.
Cute!
Let me grab my M4 and activate Ghost
Keep them extremely well fed and or help them from birth and there‚Äôs a smaller chance of an attack, this wolf in particular seems like he was watching the neighborhood dogs and realized, getting pets is nice!
I am by no means an expert, but how would that wolf react if it was starving and they went to great it?
Why did we breed dogs to be so small? So they'd eat less?
Dats a gooooood puppa
Gorgeous animal.
u/vredditdownloader
I want a wolf now
Wow what a huge boi
I must always forget how massive wolves are. Games and movies always keep them at dog height, this is massive though, like a dire wolf from GoT.
Imagine being the first dude to have a wolf
I love wolves but I would be so terrified

That‚Äôs a big one right there *said in southern accent by a slightly elderly man while he cuts an apple with a pocket knife* never seen one in the wild before.
That wolf it's almost as big as a lion, sometimes I forget they are not just wild dogs
How the fuck people thousands of years ago tame this monsters?
Are they really that big? Or is she just that small?
That's a very large good boi.....
Look at the size of that wolf. We are so fragile by comparison.
Wolves are just huge good boy. Change my mind.
This is how The Grey should have ended.

That boi is bigger than the hooman holy
That's how they get ya! Run big fella if you don't want to end up with a reverse nose
I wanna pet the wolfy boi
Big pupper
I worked 2 summers in Yellowstone. While it appears this wolf is acclimated to this human, this is crazy dangerous. Wolves have instincts which are paramount to their behavior and those instincts can override any other learned behavior, without warning and without provocation. Glad she‚Äôs OK.
So how long does a wolf remember the scent of someone like this?  Is it instant recognition or does it take a little bit for the wolf to realize who it is?
How beautiful!
big pup like small pup
That wolf has no clue how much better I could love and snuggle it over that lady
I didn't realise how big grey wolves are!!! I live in the uk.
If you haven‚Äôt watched ‚ÄúThe Grey‚Äù I recommend it. Interesting movie.
Such a beautiful forest doggo

Original doggo
Anyone got a mirror link?
Edit : Is mirror basically the same as alternative link?
Jesus they're massive.
It never ceases to amaze me just how big wolves actually are.
Beautiful creatures.
Wow. That is all.
You forget how massive they are
Did Reddit hug gfycat or did it get deleted? Page not found.
In cases like this, what happens if the animal just has a poor memory? Like, they look familiar, but it's been six months, or six years. Does the person become food?
This is the most wholesome experience I‚Äôve seen all day
it's gone now, can someone repost?
I had no idea wolfs were this big. holy shit
!remindme 2 days
Good boy indeed
Hims a good boy
Even big boys want good boy lovin
Geeze the boy is massive

So GOT direwolves werent CGI after all.
That is the face of a doggo who needed pets again
Fluff boi
I need one of those big floofs immediately.
wolf is jus big fluf doggo dat want da pets and bely rub

Huge
Reminds me of my German shepherd. Butt against me, check. Sits with head tilted for back rubs, check. Shows belly wide for rubs, check. Could possibly devour me, not sure yet.
That can‚Äôt be an alpha tho right? You can‚Äôt look them in the eye if I remember correctly

Also he is so big, I‚Äôm in love lol
Bro. All of a sudden I feel like Ghost and Nymeria should have been waaay bigger. Like that's a regular wolf, how big should a direwolf be?
Still hard to believe my Chihuahua started off as that.
Wow that good boy is so big
Too cute!!!
What do you mean becomes?? He was always good boy
He was always a good boy
He is so beautiful! Looks like a  giant husky! <3
In awe at the size of this lad.
Same argument I just used. Cats and dogs and people live in closer proximity to leopard throughout Africa.
The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives
Oh man he's huge!
Wish i was that wolf
Dang that‚Äôs a big doggie.
Big boi
Definitely a top 5 forbidden belly rub
I once almost jumped out of my skin when I saw a husky/wolf mix walking around a pet store.  It was about 3/4 the size of this wolf and it was the most terrifyingly huge dog I had ever seen in person

if it‚Äôs a canine it‚Äôs good. except chihuahuas. chihuahuas are bad. abi, if you‚Äôre reading this, you‚Äôre like three inches tall. stop bullying my friends. you aren‚Äôt intimidating. you can‚Äôt hurt them. you won‚Äôt win.
WTF this thing is huge. 

(Humbles)
If you‚Äôre this close to a wolf, could you play fight/wrestle/roughhouse with it like you would your dog?
Still think it's insane, that humans saw this predetor and were like "yeah, that thing looks cute, I want it to be my pet and hunt for me"

Humans are metal man and so is the fact that we made these beasts our friends
Yeah, all majestic alpha predator right up until it‚Äôs belly scratches time....
It is startling how large that animal is. Can you imagine one of those growling at you? Instant bowel evacuation
Watching this made me feel like I've wasted my life... Why do I even bother to wake up every morning.
That'd be the best pillow
Huge ass wolf

When did this formidable beast evolved in a Chihuahua ?!?
I don't like the assumption that this wolf *wasn't* a good boy before the cameras & people got there.
Ghost... is that you? ;(
Damn, wolves are very large.
Beautiful animal
Oh my....is that how big wolves really are?!
Gorgeous! Any chance to see the damage..
So beautiful omg
I always forget how big wolfs are
WOW he is huge!!
Wow!
Reminds me of that trainer who got hunted in a Swedish zoo
I like the little side looks when she stops petting like my dog gives me "You're not done yet, more scratching!"
Yeah Sharon keep smiling at the Wolf.
