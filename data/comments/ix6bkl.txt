Did it get tired and come to you or what ?  That's a good save buddy.
If you're ever in a similar situation, be sure to support the hind legs.  You want to grab the scruff, scoop the butt, and tuck them to your side.  If the rabbit decides to scramble when you are holding it, and you don't support those legs, they can kick hard enough to break their own back.
Bye little bun!!
"See you l8er boi" - bunny
Glad this guy found it and not a bunch of little kids.
As a certified animal nurse, I need to point something out to anyone who might try this at home: rabbits self injure their spines *very* easily. If you’re in a spot where you’re rescuing a wild rabbit, pick it up with two hands and support its spine in your arms please :)
At the end it looked like he was bounding towards a busy thoroughfare... be still my beating heart!
As a skateboarder I approve of this
Look at that little white tail floof go! They're a very good person for doing this. Must've taken a lot of patience to get the bun from 'too scared can't stop' to 'OK just give me little head scratchies'
Aww, that poor guy looked so tired and scared. Hope he was able to find some water pretty quick after this.
Forgot Tony Hawk, all hail Tony Rabbit!
Thought he was gonna fall in the grate at the end lol
[deleted]
That bunny was doing some sick moves
And it heads straight toward the traffic.
While this is a super good thing to do, and obviously this guy saved the rabbits life, you’ve gotta be pretty careful with capture myopathy with wildlife, and minimise handling as much as possible. While the rabbit appears to enjoy the stroking, it’s likely incredibly stressed. 
Still though, props to this guy, just for future reference if anyone is in this situation.
Tharn.
Congrats to this guy for doing a great thing, but for anyone else, please use both hands when picking up a rabbit. A panicked rabbit can easily break its own spine if it’s not being held properly, because their kick is so powerful. Again, cheers to this person, I’m just giving a tip for anyone who may need to pick up a bunny in the future.
Hop hop hop hop
This is my local skatepark wtf haha. Good job saving the fluffy bunny!

Top 10 skaters moments
Me: "yea man, I'm fine. Totally emotionally stable."
*sees video of skater taking time to save lil rabbit homie* 
Also me: *loud sobbing*
r/humansbeingbros
That was a sick bunny hop bro!
Good work.  Good patience and perseverance.👍🌟👏
I love the little binkies (jumps) the bunny does at the end of the video.

This is how bunnies bodies react to happiness. They can't control it, they just binky ❤️
As soon as u had him should have got him out.  Trying to befriend him just had him stressed out longer
This bunny is cute. So is the skater
I absolutely love what they did, but I feel like they could have held the bun better and caught it more gently/safely if they weren’t filming it... but that’s just my grumpy-old-man opinion
Aaaannnd...right out to traffic.
Runs straight towards traffic
PSA I've been given before by bunny owners: when possible, pick up buns in a manner that supports their feet. They can kick so powerfully they'll potentially break their own back if they kick the air.

Still, good on you for saving the little woodland creature. 🤟
He was a skater boi, bun said cya ya later boi
Sad fact:

This is a wild bunny. Their coats are more speckled and brown like this (depending on the area you live in) so If you see a bunny that has a pretty coat like the ones you see in pet stores, especially in a residential area, odds are it was someone’s pet and they set it loose. Bun buns raised as pets can’t survive in the wild as well as the wild ones.
#I'M FREEEE^e^e^e^e^e^e^e^e^e
Hey people, these are wild animals. They don't like being pet. I am glad this guy saved it but people don't seem to understand that unfortunately life isn't like Bambi. Petting a *wild* animal or bird is just torture to them.
Thank you, i really needed this today.
*goes to the road seconds later*
Or as the kids call it, a “bowl”. Cute bun bun!
can a rabbit survive in the streets alone? I guess I just never seen a stray rabbit before.
I really enjoy watching my wild bunnies. Thank you for saving this one in such a humane way!
We have a young wild bunny that has lived by our house all summer.  It was introduced to us (mainly my two kids) so young that it allows my 7 year old to get up to about 2 feet from it without batting an eye.  I Have told her repeatedly to not go closer, but I dread the day she walks in the house it chilling on her shoulder.
Surprised this doesn’t happen more often. Have skated my whole life and never seen this happen before.
He was probably so dehydrated and hungry. Good on ya kind skater sir!!
KickFlipped into my heart
It's lucky that it made it. Rabbits can literally die of fright.
Straight towards the street 😂
r/humansbeingbros
What a lovely hooman. Being sweet and patient with the little bun so he could rescue him. 🌟👍❤
Right into heavy traffic oof
/u/oriolous look at those freedom binkies!!
Here the source https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSmNvrQ7/

Btw why did you crop de video? You removed the source. Not giving credit isn’t cool
Thank you for being so kind. Poor little guy!
That is one of the most unsafe ways to pick up a rabbit.
One year account and 10 mil karma 🤔🤔
How far can you throw it?
Later the bunny returned with his board and some wax
Nature thanks you for your patience! Look at Buns excited hop at the very end!
I love that he was patient with the bunny. 🙌 great job
Cue the Eagle!!
Do you want mites? Because that's how you get mites.
He was a sk8r bun, she said “see you l8r hun”
Did you just shorten the word bunny to bun? Why
Awe, what a man.
Very nicely done good sir!
I tried to do this with a baby possum the other day. Poor dude was literally walking and too exhausted to try and run. Tried to give it water but he showed fangs and waddled into a bush. The neighborhood cat noticed the poor guy a few minutes later and a harrowing noise followed after :C
Then it runs out to traffic :<
We always think everything wants to be pet and that it feels good, but if a bear came up to me and started gently dragging it's paw down my back I wouldn't be any less scared. 



Good job helping that rabbit, I'll keep petting everything, just hopefully nothing pets back.
"I am defeated....you can eat me now."

*Pet*

"Just it over with"

*Lifts up out of pit and sets down*

"Wait..what?    Not gonna question this.  Run away!"
Don’t pet the wildlife.
[deleted]
Great now he’s trapped in the park lol
So glad you found him!! Awesome job!
Well done human
Does all that to save the rabbit, it falls in the sewer grate.
Bless your heart for saving that bunny!
Right into the highway
I was nervously waiting for Tony the Hawk to swoop in at the end.
The rabbit was shredding too! Lol
Das so sweet. Sweet bun
May or may not be the hottest thing I’ve seen all day
SPROING
Thanks! I needed this.
V cute
Oh gawd, straight to the busy highway
I love seeing this shit.
❤️ well done skater! ❤️
boing boing boing boing boing boing boing *boing* boing boing boing
I shall thank them for i am the rabbit king
Wholesommmmmme
Thank you nice human 🐰
Are you a Disney Princess?
Tony Hops.
Nice fucking save
I was halfway expecting a hawk to swoop down and grab it as it ran off
+10 humanity points
Was waiting for hawk to swoop down at the end.
He has a new friend! 😍
People who think skateboarding is a crime: I’m gonna pretend I didn’t see that.
“I’M FREE, I’M FREE!!!” [falls down grate]
Love to this guy!

My hero!
That bunny needs to learn to pump the transitions.
I like the binky kick at the end.
I thought the person was going to hold the bunny and like do some insane skate 3 hall of meat type move while holding the bunny, slightly dissappontwd
Skaters are good people to.
He was happy to be free, he binkied a little after his release!
I like the little Ollie the bunny did on the way out
Prey
Get's taken out of pool and placed on ground: "I'm free?"

Starts hopping and takes that one big hop at the end: "I'm FREEEEE!"
Where is this? This bunny is so much smaller and calmer than any bunnies I've seen in the wild.
I was cheering for the bun until I saw it started running in the direction of a busy street. Out of the fray and into another.
Moments after a hawk carried em home
Bunnies usually break their backs from flipping out when you pick them up. It is not good to pick them up, but good thing this one was tired and trusting of him!
That hop at the end while it's running
The thank-you hop at the end is all anyone needs
Saves rabbit from inside the empty pool. Rabbit says thank you and runs towards the freeway... smh
Well played!
Aw fuck man that was great.
God bless you!
Yeah that his pet
Thank you, Op!! Sick save.
It just wants Skate 4 already. So it decided to go out and pretend to skate. And you took that away from it. 😢
That bunny would go on to conquer Australia where his descendants would multiply and prosper
The way it jumped at the end ! So happy to be rescued 🥺
I read a skating bunny for some reason and I was really hyped
Saved. . .And right into the street.
"Wasn't trust. The rabbit was tired."

Rabbit immediately runs away after rescue.
/r/mademesmile
That binky as he ran off! He said thanks bro.
shoutsout rsm skatepark
Poor little bunny!! Must’ve been terrifying!
Had to double check the sub near the end, I was expecting a hawk to come swoop it up or something
I love it’s little binky at the end. I’m free!
Then he ran out into the street and got hit by a car. 

The end
Awww bunny rabid
These types of videos are why I browse reddit.
God this video reminds me of trying to catch those damn power moon rabbits in Super Mario Odyssey.
Look at his fluffy booty!
Can you post a picture of the power moon?
Poor thing, he was probably so scared!
And people say we’re thugs.
Aw this just butters my toast
This is amazing
I was waiting for an eagle to swoop in last minute but forgot I wasnt in r/unexpected
Poor thing. If there were a plank of some kind, would have been better to give the guy a ramp or something with grip to get up the side.
PARKOUR
i was waiting for the hawk at the end - thats enuff reddit for tonight...gnite reddit sleep tight
[“Screw that! It’s rabbit season and I’m hungry”](https://youtu.be/_ljVkIEqMzM)
I hope he washed his hands Google "bunny fever".
Bunny butt. CHONK
I love how the rabbit runs under the fence, stops, waves goodbye, then scurries away 🥺
Definitely didn’t expect the hawk at the end!
A cotton tail ❣️
This made me smile. Why are some people cruel to animals
He went all tharn there for a bit.
Does nobody know how to grab a rabbit by the scruff?


Also. This is totally one of those moments you expect a coyote, fox or hawk to grab it right when it seems safe.
Why isn't my bunny like that lol
Can't be the only one who's been conditioned to expect some sort of predator to pop up and eat the bunny at the end of vid...
Jk
I love her
Imagine if it would jump right back inside lol

But jokes aside, that guy had some patience..
Both very skittish creatures, not suprised they have an instant bond.
You know i half expected him to absolutely Yeet it when he was holding it.
Aaww that's so cute from the skaters part
Poeple, stop toughing wild animals for the rest of 2020. Last thing we need is to throw the harean flu into the nix.
Best Video of 2020. Thank you so much for sharing. What a great human.
The bun is so calm
Good job kid.
I don't think he's ever seen Monty Python
Cute dog
I honestly never considered the fact that rabbits have paws.
Thank you for being kind.
Headed right for the busy road 🤦‍♂️
Oh man, ive been chomped by pet bunnies ive been trying to stop escaping from someones house i was working at. This guy has some bunny game.
To be honest I was waiting to see if it got eaten by a hawk or something after it got released 😳
Im sorry but when he spins the camera to show it between its legs it kinda looks like his spine got split in half
Leave some girls for the rest of us. Who are not savings bunnies full time
I was half expecting it to turn out like the Simpsons with a hawk coming down to catch the rabbit. Glad I was wrong
Fuck you, op.  You just steal peoples content from tiktok, crop out their usernames and post their videos elsewhere
This is very wholesome
Doesn’t he know just to hold forward the left stick
My own rabbit doesn't let me pick her up like that.
It’s a beautiful sign of humanity thank you and the rest who made fun of it kiss 💋A—!
Absolutely precious
Bunnies these days... Could at least have said thank you.
I'll go running in the morning and there's a bunch of bunnies that I disturb. I often tell them, "Fear not, I am a frien of buns!"
Thank you for doing this dude, if only more people like you existed in the world.
What you do unto the least of these, you do unto me.
oh man, if he fell down that drain at the end.
I was waiting for a hawk or something to come snag it.. so glad it didn’t happen. I’ve seen too
Many of those videos and my heart couldn’t handle it.
The link between animals, includes man. I got a new feryl  cat and it did that for quite awhile until it came to terms.
Wholesome
So long partner
Bold strategy, I would've used a box or something. Rabbits aren't usually aggressive, but they can rip you up pretty good if they catch you with those rear claws, I've seen a dog get nailed once when he backed a rabbit into a corner of the yard.
r/humansbeingbros would work for this too
The bunny simply wanted to skate. Bad human didn't share skateboard and put him out of arena too. 

This bunny will be back in greater numbers to claim their unalienable right to skate. Viva La Revelutioñ

\s
Bunnies are just wonderful
It can carve the bowl like a mf tho
That bunny is probably like "Holy shit. I was TERRIFIED of humans but it feels crazy good when they touch you!"
Haha aw, that little jump over the grate. He said “ain’t falling in anything else!”
Thank you kind human!! Poor bun looked so scared at some points.
If I ever gain ownership of a skate park or end up building a skate park I'm going to include a small staircase that can be flipped over on one section of every skate-bowl and reveals a staircase for small animals to hop onto so they can get out.

Kind of like pet steps.
“Do a kickflip bro!”
I was for sure a hawk was going to fly down and snatch it.
♪ He was a boy  
She was a hare  
Can I make it any more obvious? ♪
By the way he pet it’s back I’m guessing he doesn’t have a cat
How long did it take you to gain his trust... And then get the launch codes?
Remembering that rabbits can die so easily of many things, especially fear... This was so satisfying to watch. I'm so glad it was okay.
He got it in the end, and safety too it seems but if you grab them by the back of the neck it basically paralyzes them, might have helped him get it faster I guess idk I just want to share my weird fact.
Oh, you’re not gonna eat me? -bunny
For future reference. When picking up a rabbit, it is perfectly safe for them and you to grab them by the scruff of the neck and move them.
Best thing I have seen for months.
Good deed done
Totally thought that fucker was gonna fall right in the sewer grate at the end.
I was terrified that at the end as it ran away I was gonna see a bird snatch it and fly away with it. Then I realized I was in r/aww and those fears quickly disappeared.
Where is the part of the video where the hawk makes an entrance?
Wild bun bun be free!
He/She may not be wild due to you being able to get so close and pick it up and stuff...
Who really did the rescuing here??
I've been trapped in my house with just my dogs for too long.  To myself I just said, "ooh scurred bunny" and "aw he's a-scurred, such soft". I need more interactions with humans.
That is a good save buddy.
Cute!
2020 just got a whole lot better
Good shit
Somebody send this to Vans. Get the guy a new pair of shoes.
2020 got me expecting a hawk to swoop in and grab it for some sick cosmic joke. Glad to see a happy ending.
I get the urge to pet it, but it was even more terrified. Why pet a wild animal.
I met an identical bun today! But it didn't need help :)
r/rollerblading
My bad attitude suggests that dude ran towards the road, so he statistically didn’t make it far. Hope he made it, he had pretty much given up already. Never lose hope, but don’t float on cloud 9 too long, little bro.
I rescued one and it kicked the crap out of me. Those legs are more powerful than they look.
Must have taken that wrong turn at Albuquerque
He looked so happy in the end when the giant hop lol
lmao i thought that was an open pit at the end and he was gonna fall right in
love being reminded of our capacity for kindness
Little dudes like “dammit how to I get through this fence now?”
Now remember. Someone would willingly look that thing in the eye and break its neck for fun...
I too have used the shoes in the shape of a V to lure and catch a bunny.  They like the protection it offers and it gives them a safe space to calm down and adjust to your presence.   Also, makes giving little booty bumps to direct them much simpler.
I think it’s a classic Simpsons but...but I imagine it running off and an eagle coming along and swooping it up for food.
We are trapped here together. You will trust me.
The little jump at the end made my day. 🥰
I hope there is some place for the bunny to go other than that busy street in the distance.
Oh my goodness the part where the little bun tries his hardest to hop out of the pool on his own is the saddest oh my
What a trip! Amazing!
Dude you just let a free meal go like that /s
He's gone tharn
was waiting for the hawk to swoop in
Rancho margarita skate park !? Idk if that’s the exact name but I was just there Saturday, that bowl is really big. Awesome video
I expected a hawk to swoop down after the rabbit went hopping away.
lol
I love those wild bunnnies
I can't wait for the next episode where the skater gets lost in the woods and the wild bun recognizes him and leads him back to the pool and safety.
A hop a skip and where the fuck did he go!
So sweet. I think that bunny was giving up and just come to terms that his life is over. He looked really tired.
That was hare raising
Bye bye bun bun
Just remember if you have to pick up a rabbit to always support their legs so if they kick off they kick off on *something* otherwise they will break their own back.


The lil guy in the video was too tired to kick looks like tho
That hop at the end!!
New THPS really looks realistic.
Bunny bites are brutal, that skater is brave AF
I bet that bun was so soft.
Hope he washed his hands. Rabbits can carry some nasty diseases. Tularemia doesn’t seem like a fun time
And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out! Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thou foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.
It was about to grant you 3 wishes
That jump @ the end was so cute 😆
The bunny was scared. That wasnt a invitation to petting.
We did this with a skunk last year . It sprayed us and we all stank sooo badly for so long.  My friend had a concrete bowl he built in his backyard in the woods in Kansas.
Congrats you're officially a Disney princess
i hope this isnt like the fake oiled ducks in the middle of a farm
This is def something for r/humansbeingbros
that's awesome
Man it took me thirty minutes to catch the baby bunny stuck in the two feet by one foot hole outside my window. How'd you wear it out so fast
Don't film it. Just help it.
This is beautiful
For anyone in this situation remember to support the back legs and try not to let them kick while carrying. Rabbits backs can break from the force generated by their kicking.
Plot twist.... he put the bun in the pool.
It's Daisy, and if she dies, we all know what will happen
Bunny allowed the pets at the end and was all “Thank you, hooman”
eat it
Poor little bunny.  
Nice & gentle rescuer.
I’m afraid of those big front teeth chomping me.
The binky at the end on the behalf of the bunny shows the true free rabbit spirit excitement! Weee!
That poor baby must have been so tired and scared :'(
He is so happy hopping in the end. And the bunny was happy too.
Cute video but next time definitely don't pet the rabbit like this guy did. Probably took a couple years off of that rabbit's life through stress alone.
It looks fucking terrified when it is being petted. It was probably scared shitless, paralyzed from fear, and too tired to even try to move at that that point.
It looks exhausted and terrified. Poor thing. :(
I thought the bunny was gonna fall into that drain at the end. Not gonna lie
That rabbit stuck in the empty pool is a great representation of the general feeling of 2020.
Is this Drumheller?
This guy is a lovely human being.
"Everyone liked that"
Did he come to you?
I know it’s a terrible joke but I was waiting for some hawk to swoop down...
Buddy was shredding that pool and then some asshole just stops his sess not cool bro
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’d be too scared of diseases
I like the binky at the end!
You’re going to get tularemia
Really good job! Thanks for sharing this.
So its one of those videos where a dick puts his bunny in the skate pool and picks it up later, bunnies don't sit under your feet like that.
Don’t touch wild rabbits, they’re covered in bugs and disease. The myth of the jackalope may come from rabbits with shope pappiloma, a condition that causes come-shaped tumors to grow. If nothing else they don’t know how to burn off ticks.
 Bro was just practicing his kickflip he doin pretty good tho
Ah yes, straight towards the busy main road.
I watch too much R unexpected, I thought the rabbit was going in the grate for sure.
r/skatersbeingbros
Need to be fast when you grab a bun, they can run off. And support hind legs, but dude had only 1 free hand. Better to use two.
🥰
that little extra hop at the end...
That made me happy !
I figured it would get hit by a car.
I like how he waited to build up trust and petting before he picked him up, thankyou Skater Dude
I was kind of hoping he’d look back at the camera before his little cotton tail disappeared!
Sick ollie at the end
Did you end up finding out who framed the rabbit?
The natural order has been restored; how ironic.
That's cool but those guys usually get snagged by hawks or falcons.
THE LITTLE JUMP IN THE END OMG CUTEEEE
I love how he built up trust before the big move. Well done lad. 🥰
Humans. They can be alright sometimes!
I wasn't watching the time, and then looked away right before it looped, so I momentarily thought the bunny jumped back in, and it was hilariously stupid and adorable.
That’s so awesome!
[deleted]
Was expecting a hawk to swoop down at the moment of freedom! But I was wrong.
Wild animals will not usually allow you to pet them between the eyes. This bunny must have been really, really at the end.
A more intelligent solution would have involved getting a mattress and putting it against the side. That would have solved the problem with less stress for the animal and it would have been safer.

It would be even better if building codes would be adapted such that animal concerns would also be taken into consideration. It's not like it would matter for the costs of the building.
u/vredditdownlader
Almost went and fell into the storm drain
r/humansbeingbros
If you flip them on their backs it paralyzes them, makes them much easier to handle.
it literally let you give head scratchies?? the buns in my yard run away when i anyone is in a five mile radius
u/Foundation-Lost
His momma raised him right
Man I was hoping for the look back at the end
Wow. How long did it take for it to trust him enough?
Skater of the week.
Granted, if this was a deer they'd jump right back in.
That kid has some major hops
Arghhh please don’t pet the wild bunny who is terrified of you but too exhausted to run
Poor guy.  This man deserves a parade.
Poor bun must have been terrified. Well done for having compassion.
Damnit will someone please stop cutting onions near me
I know this is sick of me to think this...but I thought it would be hilarious if it ran away and straight into traffic and the video cut. Anyway, thanks for being a good person lmao
I’ve seen dozens of rabbits in Seattle, seems they are everywhere around here.
I feel like this video is missing about 3 hours of progress work.
Skate or die!
Run rabbit run lol I think I made a wrong tire in albacerky
[deleted]
You gave done well. Saving a life, nothing better. Hope the sun shines for you (and your bun-bun friend) all day!
Poor little guy looks so tired and scared :c.  Thanks for being patient with him.  I wish we could tell them we want to help.
NOT TO THE STREET, BUN BUN!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING??
Gets hit by car
I thought it was yes yes no with that vent at the end. My heart.
Good save.
Put the damn phone down and quit fucking around and get the poor bastard outta there. Jeez. This video shouldn’t even exist.
That’s a lot of trust shown by that rabbit, being picked up in the wild pretty much always means you’re about to be eaten.
Good human
Good thing Tony ^^^the Hawk didn’t find it first.
Some bunny loves you!
Could’ve given him a skateboard
Humans being bros
Then you see a cobra out of nowhere
u/gifreversingbot
Rescues have to be so surreal for critters. Here's this terrifying apex predator stalking you, outthinking you, immune to all your threats, and just when they have you in their terrible grabbing appendages, they let you go and you're free of whatever trap you got yourself into
FREEEEEEEEDOM!!!!!!!!!!!!
Okay, but don't try to befriend it. It looks suuuuper stressed. Bunnies/rabbits can die from stress. And being pet will not register as being friendly to wild animals, more like being toyed with by a predator. (Like cats do)
😊
It's not comfortable around him, it's just so exhausted it literally can't move, the thing is in full panic mode
Awww that’s a rare occurrence to be able to pet one.He was probably so grateful for the help!
Easier to pick him up than my House Bunny.
Yay!
Rabbits can literally die of fright and the poor thing looks petrified so this could have gone a lot worse
Radical dude!
That is awesome thank you good human
Aww.
I mostly love the patience and gentle way he did this!
Good vibes there. Nice work.
Stop petting it it's not friednly, it's playing dead. Just get it out of the pit and then walk away.
Aww cute but it’s not a pool it’s called a bowl if we talk skating
We've got one just like that who sprawls out on the lawn in the shade everyday. He gets pretty relaxed considering all the hawks and owls we have in the neighborhood
Awwwww thanks for that
[ominous realization] That's no pool.
Skaters are some of the nicest people 🥰
That bunnies got some sweet moves
If anyone ever needs to pick up a bunny grab the back of it's neck that's where the mothers grab them and that way they can't bite you if they're scared or stressed out (believe me bunny bites are nasty). And put your other hand under it's hindlegs/feet or butt. That way you have a secure grip on the bun and you aren't hurting it and it can't hurt you. Source: My grandpa had bunnies from before I was born until I was 19yo and I was around them literally all the time
I just hope OP didn’t put the bunny there just for views  😭😔
Straight to the highway...
Expected a hawk at the end...
r/humansbeingbros
Why do u guys crop in to remove the Tik Tok logo? Ur no better than the instagram ppl that take from reddit.
Now the skater has Lyme disease and the rabbit is a stoner.
Looks like it ran straight towards the street. Shit. Those feet might not be good luck
I love rabbit ...thier really cute creature
Look at him shred the pool to pieces before the rescue tho. Cool.
Thought Bob Bunnyquest was going to pull a backside shifty on that first hit
Awwww.
That bunny running free into the grass made me tear up as I’m trapped here in my fucking cubicle
Runs straight into traffic
Hare* not bun

Different genus

Same cute
That is so awesome. I love rabbits.
I love this
“Bright eyes... burning like fire...”
You can see his heart beating
While it is cool he did this for anyone who will do the same wear gloves wild rabbits can carry some nasty diseases
Wholesome 100
And he probably ran into that road in the distance.
Fuck that’s wholesome. 😍😭👏
I would have at least pumped a round a sec with him in hand
I like how it paused for one last pet b4 bouncing!
Poor little guy must've been so exhausted.
Little dude was just trying to work on his bunny hop......
How do you know or what indicated that the dude was a skater?
Poor terrified baby 🐇
Hang on, did a wild bunny do a binkie because this guy helped it? This brings much joy.
Aww, such a sweet bunny! Bless you for rescuing him/her! ❤
so tiny!!!!!!
He ran off sooo happy
I’d be so scared of getting bit
Wholesome
This is so wholesome
I hate them, ate all my veggies in the garden, caught one of them, it was too cute to be hurt, so jailed it overnight and released next day, never came again.
Cursed Comment alert, but Imagine doing a drop in and just *crunch*
Yes run free! To the busy highway
Reminds me of that rabbit from Mario 64 you had to catch in the game. Like if you know what I’m talking about :)
Honestly this guy got lucky wild rabbits will often die from stress if caught
Why did I expect it to jump back into the pool.
So cute!
I am a terrible person. I wanted the bunny to immediately fall back into the empty pool, or to be swooped by an eagle.
I can't imagine the amount of feminist *poon* this dude is gonna get.  Knock 'em out the box, bro!
This happened to me with a rat
Not a pool op. Where do you think skaters go?
If only he could of bunny hopped a little higher
That's a beautiful rabbit 💞
You don't see this on your evening news
Goodbye old friend. May the force be with you.
He was a skater boy she said see you later boy
skaters are ok by me
That bunny must've been incredibly super tired or just gave up on life.

You literally cannot pick up a bunny like that, unless you want scratches along your entire forearm.

I mean it did work out here, but usually you'd have to go for the scruff, if you wanna handle them in any way, not that you should touch or pet wild animals.
Bunny are everywhere. 
My dogs are friends with the ones at my yard
It's called Hasenpfeffer...and he let it get away.
Good job but trying to get it to trust you may not be the beet idea. It may wander up to the wrong human one of these days
Love the binky at the end
Rabbits are so fragile. It’s insane.
He could have done that a lot quicker saving the rabbit from distress but I guess he would not have won Internet points that way.
OMG BABEYYY🥺🥺
Thanks for helping him !!!
he was a skater boy she said see ya later boy
anybody else waiting for the bunny to take one last cinematic look over the shoulder before he was gone for good.

I feel like this would have been way easier with two hands.
That’s not a pool
This is super awesome and I'm really happy to see it get saved, but also for anyone ever in this situation when you grab a bun.

Try to cradle it in your shirt or by its mid section and hind legs/butt as just grabbing from the middle leaves there head and legs hanging and if the bunny struggles and kicks hard enough its neck can break and it may die. Flipping on its back will cause it to stop moving entirely and freak it out so don't do that either.
Next Frame: eagle swooping for lunch
Having rescued a couple wild rabbits out on the farm. That is the look of total defeat. And probably dehydration.
It was his pet rabbit
Unfortunately, he was a skater boy, and therefore the bunny said, “see you later, boy”.
this is nice, but all i can see is that one video of some family releasing a bunny or whatnot that just gets nabbed immediately by a hawk or something
Don’t cry don’t cry don’t cry aaaaaand I’m crying
So cute, he's gonna live on to make lots of other little bunbuns.
🥺 the trust
Omg that hop at the end. Well done mate.
Gets hit by a car moments later.
Unknown to you, the rabbit has sworn a life debt to you.

in your darkest hour, the bun will arrive!.
That bunny is hella fast
You're the best! Thank you!
Maybe put your phone down so you can actually hold it back legs.
