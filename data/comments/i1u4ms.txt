GREAT thing to train one’s dog to do at home, eat off the counter... good for the karma, bad for the sandwich you just finished. *jaws theme intensifies*
Her name is Lola, she is a cheesegirl
Literally training your dog to eat food off the counter?
Kitchen shark
I'm probably gonna get down voted to hell for going against the grain, but encouraging that behavior worries me. What if somebody places something edible but not necessarily safe for dogs and this happens? I'm doubtful you'd even have time to react before it was already swallowed. I imagine a trip to the vet to pump the dogs stomach wouldn't be cheap.
Highly reminiscent of orca spy hopping behavior
"target acquired"
teaching your dog that it's ok to grab things from the kitchen counter... brilliant strategy there
When ~~sharks~~ doggos attack
Lola looks like a muppet and I cannot stop laughing LOL
She acquired her target first like any badass would do then took out said target.
She looks like a crackhead, still super cute tho
I didn't see Lola.  Must be one of those sneaky ninja dogs.
I want to say at first glance this was cute, but as a dog trainer.... It makes me cringe.
Well thats just encouraging shitty behavior
This is me. I like this.
Please don’t teach your pets to jump up and eat off the tables. That’s nasty.
That's a puppet, right?
I've never related to anything more.
I suspect you will live to regret teaching her that it’s ok to do that. It’s bad enough when you do everything in your power to stop them.
The WILD look in the eyes when they hone in on her cheese-prey is hysterical.

Counter sharks. My Malamute likes to leave at least two things on the floor every time we leave. Serving spoon and small tureen last night.  Thankfully he gently pulls the breakable down. I think it's mostly for show that he can.

My German Shepherd LOVES cheese. You can be cooking and he’s passed the hell out in the other room. You grab the cheese and he will teleport to your side with HUGE puppy eyes like you haven’t fed him in 6 years.
This is hypnotizing. Can’t stop watching.

The sideways snatch technique is a pro move.  My dog mastered it before we instilled the value that the kitchen was not for her, and she would use it to snake food off of plates without making any noise or moving the plate.

That's true but I feel like Nintendo may have had a hand in it . They just happen to sell their entire inventory of switchs and switch lite , how convenient. Now if you want to get one it's 500 dollars and it's bright yellow (not that there's anything wrong with that). Everyone says sold out company wide. The thing is I had the money to get one Amazon had the switch lite for 199.99 but my GF wanted to be able to play on the TV and the switch lite can't so I didn't get it. Now after waiting so long it's like fuck it I'll buy the switch lite but now it just so happens Amazon jumped up to like 350 dollars for just the lite. It's just bullshit is there not a ware house somewhere full of them I can't catch a break. And what's u with Yamauchi?
