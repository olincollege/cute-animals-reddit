When he‚Äôs wearing his glasses it reminded me of Salem, from Sabrina the Teenage Witch.
That chain and glasses combo fly as fuck
I love the sunglasses! This kitty is going places
This baby is going places, look at her owning every single outfit
Wow. Your cat about to end the Hadid sisters whole career
That is an amazing catwalk
Her tail in the 2nd demo looks like it‚Äôs doing the sassy hand snap.
I love the fact that someone had to have most of those outfits before quarentine. 


Kitty did a great job!
I've NEVER seen a cat so comfortable with clothes and accessories. On top of that the strut is so great. I am so impressed by this.
I'm too sexy for this fur

too sexy for this fur

Too sexy

I  purr purr purr
I shake my little tush on the "catwalk".

Quarantine: The Salem Saberhagen edition
Quite a catwalk! My cat couldn't never ever pull this out so fashionyable, she'd freak out and be a run away model lol
That's one mellow cat!
Absolutley faaaaaaaaaabulous
Cat got that swagger!
This cat has more personality than me
I‚Äôm going to watch this every day until I die
Its literally a Cat Walk
This is why our pets regret wishing we‚Äôd be home more.
Come through Eurovision kitty girl!
This is the only fashion the world needs anyway üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
My cat literally just falls over and yowls if I put a color on him
What song is that I need to know!
This is the best thing that I have seen all day
Thank you for posting this!! This is exactly what I need right now. Today is my birthday and I'm alone and sad and this gave me a much needed laugh!
Look at that strut. Amazing.
That rover is so hot right now
Cats be like... So glamorous
This is exactly the sort of boredom inspired content I've been waiting for. I can feel the cracks widening, the inhibitions falling. Bravo, i say, BRAVO!
The swag
It got more elaborate with every frame
I like the first outfit. Did your kitty just get back from nam?
I have a black cat so I LOOOOOVVVVEED this! Thank you!!!
Werk it kitty.
I'm so glad we have nothing better to do than enjoy our pets and make people smile
Pretty cool. Our cat would never do that. Great job!
My favorite‚Äôs the fall one
That‚Äôs a very tolerant cat. Mine freaks out if you try to put so much as a paperclip on her.
Always kinda figured that when my former agency said 'Fierce like a tiger", they were only using a metaphor. Now I know what perfection on the catwalk looks like...
That is either an unbelievable patient cat, or he plans to serve his revenge cold.
Wow!! What a beautiful, majestic cat!!
I just can‚Äôt get past the fact that you were not only able to get your cat to cooperate with wearing outfits, but you also got him/her to walk the catwalk with the proper strut.

Mine would never
Can this be the permanent replacement for New York Fashion Week?
That's great!! I loved it.
Fashion show, fashion show, fashion show at lunch!
I don't know how you got your cat to wear any of that. Mine would look at me and proceed to fall over and not move.
Such a good tempered cat, and beautiful cat. Thank you for sharing this delightful video!
Look at that TAIL, it has an attitude of its own
So I watched this video and the song ‚ÄúPaint it Black‚Äù by The Rolling Stones came on. Fitting
More of this. I NEED FUCKING MORE OF THIS
Cat "They keep putting weird shit on me and pointing that rectangle at me that they worship. Am I their new God?"

The 2 Chainz outfit had me dying üòÇ
Your model is doing a great job on the ‚Äúcat walk‚Äù. I always adopt black cats & appreciate seeing them represented ‚ù§Ô∏èüêæ
u/VredditDownloader
This made me smile. I use to not like cats, but these reddit posts have been changing my perspective..
All the cats I‚Äôve had in my life, not a one of them could stand wearing anything! They‚Äôd just do that ‚Äúeh error, can‚Äôt walk, going boneless‚Äù flop on the ground until they could wriggle out of whatever it was.
She is *fierce* with that stomp walk
Something something catwalk.
Mouse necklaces. So hot right now.
STRUT THAT CATWALK HUNTY!!
He's got a strut most women can't even master. The whole video was glorious, every second!
The fact that you were even able to get any of the outfits on amazes me
This is why I come to this sub
I‚Äôm using this to convince my bf that we need a cat
This made me grin.
Your cat has sass and I like it
Like if he was born to do this lol. Freaking natural cat walker, haha. They invented cat walking
I would be scratched from head to toe if I attempted this why my cat.
This has to be the most patient, easygoing cat in the world.
I like the cats, but I have been a huge fan of [Siren Song](https://youtu.be/uv5d58mwIE0) for a while. Shout out to my favorite artist from Ukraine.
He wears the bodies of his victims in his first outfit ü•∫
Americas next top meowdel.
Are we gonna talk about how this cat walks to the beat better than some humans
Song should have been:

 Right Said Fred - "I'm too sexy"
TIL why it's called the catwalk.
And look here.  We have this year's new fall style. 
Its falls under the Category of Catastrophe. And by I mean catastrophe i mean she is killing it out there. The other cats might as well be 3 blind mice. 
The moment she hits the runway it's like the she has cat nip, they can't stop staring. I'd say she's purrfect. The others competition is glasses of water and shes knocking them down.
*On the Catwalk, On the Catwalk, I shake my little tush on the Catwalk*
I would give this gold but I cant so here ya go üéñ
Oh she is FIERCE
I love this so fucking much
Oo that catwalk
Hands down the best Model/Cat...and not the other way around. So hot right now.
Literally catwalk.
Rover has some serious swagger! My favorite was the bat look with its kills scattered over the floor. Kitty owned it!!
I‚Äôm so in love with this !
Catwalk.
Nice
something something catwalk!!!!!!
Makes more sense than most real fashion shows.
Work it girl!
I am a damn good journalist, and this cat show thing is¬†grade A baloney!
Ah yes, the cat walk
Wonderful show! The model is proving Black is beautiful once more!
Beautiful!  Work it girl!
But why male models.
I‚Äôd pay money to see this in person. Like a lot. 

You‚Äôre cat is so chill! Mine would NEVER cooperate lmao.
The cat nailed the walk down that thing that human fashion models walk down.
That's the most docile cat I've ever seen
What is that beat though? How can I find it?
She needs to do a little turn on her catwalk.
This is the most fabulous cat I've ever seen, and I live with one that's really fabulous, so that's saying something
The worlds first cat that is compliant with costumes
every costume except the bat should of had the shades
This precios baby is absolutely slaying it on the catwalk
He walks like a runway king!
I love how well behaved your cat is.  Mine would not walk towards the camera in a straight line, let alone wear anything I tried to put on them.
My cat can‚Äôt even handle a small piece of tape stuck on her.
So nice watching a video on Reddit that isn't someone doing a provocative dance on Tik Tok.
Okay, somebody has a LOT of time on their hands.  Okay, really nice job! Thank you! :)
Fashion show? Yo this cat fashion show hit *different*
10s 10s 10s across the board!
If I put so much as a leaf on my cat he'll lay down and go "well I guess I'm never walking again"
Of course, none of these clothes I could wear.
Cat *absolutely* has wares, if you have coin
I feel like maybe the Egyptians did this.Also
That cat dresses like current nba players
Now this is real catwalk.
The best cat walk I have seen in forever
Alternative title: cat walk
Proper catwalk
Now that's a cool cat.
That cat is such a divaü§©
Oh my.. this takes the greatest cake out of them all!
Such a natural.  The mirrored glasses and chains. üëçüò∏üêæüêæ
This cat is very tolerant.
Reason 5843 of why I need a feline in my life
Cat‚Äôs beautiful - but your fridge is sooo shiny!
*Covercat put the bass in your walk. Head to paw, let your whole body talk*
Cat honestly dresses better than me, especially theses days.
My wife if judging me for watching to repeatedly.  I do not care. BRAVO...
That's a cat walk if I seen any
I call that a catwalk
This cat is the coolest!
This is so precious. Beautiful kitty and she's so feminine!
This one of my favorite things I‚Äôve ever seen!
Oh ma gawd l. Who is she? She styling
How high do you have to be in order to say ‚Äúyou know what we should do, man? A fashion show with Mr. Bojangles, man!‚Äù
Why is she so great at this??
Now that's a proper catwalk!
With the wings, your kitty looked like toothless!
What a lovely kitty! Nice dresses also :D
Now that's what I call a cat walk!
So it‚Äôs a cat walk
Cat got me feeling superstitious!
Cat Mom of the Year goes to......
Now I know why they call it a ‚Äúcat walk‚Äù
That is one cool cat
How is she so calm, when my cousin and I dressed up her cat, he looked miserable. He kept on looking to our relatives for help.
This cat looks like ROYALTY
Oh my gosh, the cat actually walks like a model
You have an incredibly patient, and incredibly fabulous cat.
I just realized why its called a catwalk.
It‚Äôs a cat walk
u/VredditDownloader
Damn best catwalk ever
Oooo that cat walk is smooth
..
I think on some level the cat knows what's going on.
The CatWalk of the model is purrfect ‚ò∫Ô∏è
That pause (paws, for punners) in fur coat as the tail keeps squiggling.
Your cat puts up with a lot of crap.
Made my day!! How can I download this video
THIS IS PURE ART
Reddit sucks
this is a repost I‚Äôve seen it on reddit a few times
It‚Äôs a literal catwalk.
Never seen a cat put up with a lot of shit
Song is Siren Song by Maruv for those who are wondering
Someone please tell me this cat has a IG catwalk page.
Bruh, you got all the infinity awards
Random question? How do you like your Samsung fridge? I'm looking buy one. I know super random lol
I WANT MORE!!!!! üêàüêàüêà
That cat knows exactly what it's doing.
That would be what I call a ‚Äúcatwalk‚Äù ;)
This is awesome. Watched it over and over. Thank you.
While watching this I found my self pretending to be the one giving scored in a fashion competition. Saying it aloud. But I have say 10/10 for a fabulous cat
I'm a model, you know what I mean, and I  shake my little tushie on the catwalk....
Wow. What a tolerant cat
This cat makes me realize I've been doing it all wrong...my cat would shred anything I tried to put on her. I've watched it 4 times and it just keeps getting better.
Riveting dawhling (written to sound snobby)
The catwalk must go on
Yasss queen
I'll never obtain kitties shades and chain level of coolness and after seeing this void rock it I understand why I'll never achieve it.
Absolutely no living creature on earth has as much swagger as this cat does

I know the Halloween one is supposed to be a bat, but all I see is toothless.
Love him
This is the best fashion show I have ever seen. So adorably cute. The model is working that run way üòä
the fit... the presence... the drama... she's owning the stage
This is @rover_thecat on IG if anyone wants to find this glamorous boy

This is exactly what the internet needed today.
This cat is p o w e r f u l

That cat walk though-
I'd actually get into fashion if kitty model.
That cat is very tolerant
This is the only fashion show that matters!
Next level catwalk right there
Get it!!
Look at that elegance!  Freaken A, now that is a walk! XD
2nd cat wins in my opinion.
The catwalk intensifies
Fabulous
Be careful; you can‚Äôt vote her out at the next tribal council.
Chain and glasses on this cool cat are out of this world.
Pretty cool that 2Chainz showed up
Now this is what you call the real catwalk!
Those little mice on that necklace in the beginning, my cat Savannah absolutely goes crazy for those!
Work it!
Who ever you are, I love you! That is the sweetest funniest video - your cat must have gotten his sense of humor from you
This is what the internet needs!!!!!!
Simply awesome!
Haha my cat would never get on board with this! Amazing little runway model
This cat makes me wanna go buy catnip.

Why are cats so graceful to us?
How you get the cat to wear glasses?!?
Fab you luss
A literal catwalk.
I'm glad someone finally found a socially acceptable use for tik Tok.
Please tell me others noticed the tail going to the music on the 2nd strut. It was two purrfect
Transcendant
THIS--This is the queen of black cats! And she knows it....
Gorgeous
First outfit looks like she‚Äôs wearing the skulls of her enemies
This is the only kind of fashion show I want to see.
That is the most tolerant cat ever and I love it
This is what you get when you combine killer instinct with killer fashion sense
What a pretty cat!!
ngl the glasses and chain are pretty dope
This is the first cat I have ever seen walking with stuff/clothes on
*I'll see you after the function* üéµ
You have a very patient cat.
FIERCE!!! üëç
Wanna know my secret?

Bang.
Love it.
She is the moment.
Darn she's gorgeous. Whats her name?
Sashay, shantay. lol Love this!
I never knew how much I needed this in my life until this moment.
Down the cat walk
This is awesome!
I love that first one, with the heads of her enemies around her neck. (Plus the bodies, yes.)
They don‚Äôt call it a cat walk for nothing.
That cat knows how to strut!
Wearing that last outfit though?? That cat had big balls.
I've started to understand......furries.

Being quarantined isn't helping.
I love the mouse necklace!
Ahh, the joys of quarantine.
I live the gangster one (#3)
We really don't deserve our pets.

That really made me happy.
Pure top model energy here. Someone get this cat a contract!
This cat is making the cut!
This is awesome,  my cat only walks backwards when I put a cape on him.
Leaves was my favorite but bats makes the most sense
Glorious! Bravo!
SLAY QUEEN
Amazing just what I needed!! Great music as well lol
Authentic Cat Walk
That is an unbelievably cooperative cat...
Cause I'm a model, you know what I mean

And I do my little turn on the cat walk

Yeah, on the cat walk

On the cat walk, yeah

I shake my furry tush on the cat walk
Bat wings are so hot right now!
This is the only fashion show worth watching. So much better than blonde women with fake smiles, skinny bodies, and caked makeup
Do they have a Insta or anything?
Kitty Cat-walk
Im not worthy honestly.
haha, the first one reminded me of the movie 300. " You bring the crowns and heads of conquered kings to my city steps"
ICONIC
I'd totally wear the bat wings next season.
Hmmm
Whoever made this, bless you
seems like the second one should go with star wars imperial march. That pause and outfit was vader-like.
This is one of the cats in the kid stories that can go invisible in the dark and you can only see it‚Äôs eyes
The sunglasses killed me
On the catwalk.  Yeah the walk.
I was expecting the buttercup strut
What a poser üòÇ

This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all quarantine. Thank you so much
I see now why it is called...the catwalk.
i'm calling peta
When I tried to put a coat on my cat,  it refused to no end,  when I did force it on her, she tried to walk,  and then gave up half way through and fell onto the ground lifeless.
The walk! She has it! Work it baby!
I love how it has a mouse necklace. A necklace of its dead prey. Also, your cat even walks like it is on the runway. Such a beautiful cat!!! Reminds me of the black cats i have.
Thanks for sharing this blessing of a video.
This made my entire day. That cat knows how to work it!
How does one make a cat wear sunglasses...
this is the kind of catwalk that i like ;)
The cat is being a good sport
The necklace of rats is a bit messed up lol

That cat spells ‚Äúsexy‚Äù with three Xs
Girl, I don't dance, I work
I don't play, I slay
I don't walk I strut, strut, strut and then sashay (okay)

Thank you for sharing my video!!
this little one is going far!!!!!
"Although having the reputation of being quite 'catty' she was always the most felicitous on the catwalk.

Autumn realness was my favorite look. work kitty!
Omg Amazing. This is literally the BEST music score for this video. You go fab kitty fashion queen yaaaaas.
Too sexy for catwalk
90/10 She has a future in modeling
What kind of cat is that called?
So what you're saying is, if I wasn't "essential personnel" (hospital workers are essential in a health crisis? Fake fucking news!) I could be doing this with my cat? 

Brb, picking a new career path.
This is AMAZING! We don‚Äôt need human models anymore, cats can rule the catwalk like they should.
This is how I'm going to be spending my quarentine days from now on. 

Say a prayer for my cats plz. üòÅ
Kitteh working it!
Toothless? Is that you?
I‚Äôm not even a cat person and this is great, lol üòÇ
Werk mama!!!!!
I wanna know her secret (bang)

I thought the first outfit was very mice.
This is the only fashion show that matters.

actually better than all fashion catwalk shows i've ever seen
That asshole wearing fur, its 2020 common!
This is why the Internet was invented.

Yass queeeennnn!
Easily the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day.
This void kitty is chill as fuck
OUTSTANDING.
Damn yo, cat's footsteps matched up with the music a few times there too. That was awesome, lol.
What a magnificent show!  Thank You
I like that Toothless look.
My god. Absolute fire.
Cat is owing it!
Also I really like your flooring
Her tailgame is astonishing
Ah so *that's* where the term catwalk comes from.
She stomps that runway!
I now understand why it's called a catwalk
She certainly has the strut down
Move over Jimi

And let Rover take over
How do you keep the cat walking straight and not tearing the costume apart?
I can‚Äôt upvote this enough
I'd love for someone to put this to the tune of lady gaga.

Walk, walk fashion baby
She is surely going to win :D
Stylin'
That lady is top notch-- you've made my day
IT'S THE BEST ONE!!!
This cat owns the room and she knows it!

You made my day! Awesome show üëçüëç

She's adorable :) How did you make her walk towards the car.era so good?
I ded at the elton john glasses üòÅ
Werq that puss!
Cats are the worlds shittest animals
Can we swap cats?
Shes an icon, shes a legend and she IS the moment!
Stunning! She is ICONIC! Queeeeen!
There is no way my cat would: 1. Let me put those outfits on him and 2. Walk in a straight line to me when I wanted him to.
Now I know why they call it a catwalk!
That‚Äôs one good looking cat
Best post I've seen in a while... Thank you.
She is so good!
CATWALK BITCH
It takes a lot to handle all
Enter the catwalk
Nailed the cat walk!
HE'S BEAUTIFUL!
What a beautiful kitty
Love it!
Fierce!
This is high fashion
Work it, kitty girl!!!
Would anyone else's cat just lie down on the floor and be a fat blob instead of actually walking and no I do not over feed my cats they just like stealing other cats food
Your kitty owns the catwalk!
cat walk
Look at that catwalk.
That cat is game for everything! The glasses surprised me the most. It didn't even look uncomfortable.
Thank you for not making it a Victoria Secret Runway .
Really digging the second outfit though
First the step then the tail matches the music wtf
Holy fudgecakes!  I can‚Äôt believe your cat tolerated all those costumes. What a diva. My whole family watched this like 10 times. Thanks for the fun!
00:17 
‚ÄúIM GUNNA BE A MIGHTY KING! SO ENEMIES, BEWARE!‚Äù

Cat fashion show from Anchorman haha
Amazing catwalk
I tried to put clothes on my bearded dragon but she jumped from my bed onto the ground and then proceeded to poop on the carpet.
Catwalk model!
What a diva!
OMG that is so cute. The bat wings are brilliant. Thanks for the LOL!
That cat is working that catwalk.
Cool Winterfell coat
My cat needs those glasses and chain
Are they from your fall collection?
Whoa, is that Quavo?
So classy!
She owns the catwalk.
I was soo looking forward to the Catty Couture line, too...they got an AMAZING model. I heard she doesn‚Äôt get out of bed for less than $15,000, but she has a really bad Catnip addiction.
Those shades lmao.
C‚Äôest magnifique!
Cat walk
that catwalk tho
Sweet!
This is the greatest thing I've ever seen.
This cat literally stops and vogues to the beat what the fuck!?
Lawd they slayin'
This looks like my cat. I would buy all these costumes for him.
I can't believe this isn't titled cat walk.
That walk... those outfits.... üò±
Now that's a catwalk! üòπ
" I know I'm fabulous but also I hate you" chic
She looks like a company president.
‚ù§Ô∏è
Damn i love black cats
I generally prefer dog's but I gotta say, cat's win tail-wise. A dog's tail basically just wags or hangs, some fancy bois have it curled up but that's it. Cat's, on the other hand, have tails with their own mind. They point up, then do the ? to the right and left, sometimes they whip around and sometimes they point straight back. A whole 'nother pet in itself.
The ONLY fashion show worth watching!
This is so puuuurrrfect!! üòª
why does this cat have more style in one paw than I do in my whole being
beautiful

where can i get tickets to the show
Look at that cat walk...
Love this Cat‚Äôs show!
Quarantine has a lot to answer for, haha
That is a patient cat.
Wow what an amazing kitty!
That‚Äôs the best catwalk I‚Äôve ever seen.
This cat is cooler than I will ever be.
"On the catwalk, on the catwalk, yeah, I do my little turn upon the catwalk."
The first is like a trophy
Dang what a star
I love those tail wagsüòç
Incredible. All the cats I've ever encountered are incredibility squeamish. How do you avoid them freaking out at anything you attach to them?
The only valid fashion show. Everyone can go home. This boi stole the whole show.
That's a good looking cat
Black goes with anything
This post wins the internets for the day. ~~Hands down~~ _paws to the floor_
She got that strut mastered, kitty got game
Fierce as fuck
This. This is good content.
the confidence! meee-ow
YESSS!
She really works that catwalk.
the way the tail moves to the music on the second outfit is mesmerizing
Well thats a catwalk if i've ever seen one.
Cat, so hot right meow.
Pose.
Purrfecto!
Thank you for this.
She knows EXACTLY what she‚Äôs got üêà
The fact that the cat isn‚Äôt bothered for wearing any type of gear is surprising.
I like this much more then regular fashion shows
What the ass is this! ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£this is great rofl
During the second outfit, the cat stops and wags her tail to the beat of the song and it's so cool
it's awesome because her tail goes with the beat on the second outfit
I LOVE THE FIRST ONE!
/r/ntbdbiwdfta
This is adorable but it makes me wonder.


What exactly is that cat seeing in those glasses in the first one? What does it look like to it compared to humans?
#S T R U T
I needed this today! Thank you!
I'd give this 100 upvotes if I could. SHE EFFING OWNED IT!

The cat wins. The cat wins everything.
Thank you.
Is that 2 chainz?!
*cat walk*
Your cat slays
I have always thought we need more spider cats. They are at minimum 20x more effective at catching mice.
Okay, but seriously, cats can contract corona, and it's suspected they can do so more easily than dogs. Don't let your cat(s) outside.
She IS a model.. look how she sways with that beat.
This was fuckin spectacular! The sunglasses n chain and bat wings were my absolute favorites ü§©üòÖüôÉ
I love it.
Really got the CAT walk down
This is amazing and now I want to convince my cat to do it .... unfortunately I don‚Äôt think he has the same model swag
Just look at that catwalk
This is so awesome! Plus, what track is it it‚Äôs a banger
That Rover's so hot right now
Awesome!  Thank you:)
Oh, come on! You couldn't use Right Said Fred's, "I'm Too Sexy"?!

"On the catwalk, on the catwalk."
He/She wins. I don't care what the other judges think.
Hahaha that's awesome üòçüòçüòçüòò
The only show I'm interested in.
Sissy that walk, hunty!

I miss my all-black cat.
Just me and my cat on lock down xxx
I love this! Super precious <3
The music was so well timed with her steps, loved it
Is your cat named after Rover from Animal Crossing?
I‚Äôm worried that if the quarantine goes on long enough, you‚Äôll rewatch this video and try to remember whether you did all of these at once or just one every now and then for each season.
That's a dog in a cat's body, no way it's that chill dressed up lol
It‚Äôs a mix of a cat and a bat, it‚Äôs a cat!

That mouse collar is so Apocalypse Now.
when will these pieces be available to purrrrchase?
Was the audio or video tempo manipulated to ensure the perfect timing of the beat and the step?

Whichever, pro move or perfect timing.
Literally a Catwalk
Got that cat walk down.
She wears it well!

This baby was made for the Catwalk.
BREAKING NEWS: In light of the new growing evidence that cats can contract COVID-19 we would like to retract our previous article referencing that fashion shows are replacing models with cats.

All fashion shows have now been cancelled.

Stay safe
I thought Grace Jones retired

What a show off after a big hunting game.
How in the heck have you got that cat walking on the beat? Such a talented kitty
Duuuude this made my day lol. Been kinda sick lately (no, not COVID-19) so this lifted my spirits a bit.
That cat is wearing the bodies of its slain enemies around its neck in the first one. 
Is no-one even going to mention that?
Is that Kim Katdashian? She definitely took some weight off the rump throwing this coronavirus. Looks like it worked well for her.
That pause on the second outfit with the tail flick was perfect
You could say that this is a catwalk
What an incredibly good-natured cat!
