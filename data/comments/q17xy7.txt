Sleep eating is actually a great trick with inappetant cats. I had a cat with kidney disease who felt lousy at times and if I put a bowl of food next to her fave while she slept she'd normally jolt awake and eat for a solid 30 seconds reflexively. 

It's also just cute.
Imagine dreaming of food and it appears in front of you


Kitty must think its magic
Dude, how did you manage to place the shrimp down without waking up the kitty? Mine wakes up if I even *think* about picking up my camera to record from across the room!
Dreams do come true
The few times I’m happy to unmute and hear the little lip smacking noise
Everyone's cat seems to love shrimp. But for some reason mine doesn't even touch the stuff. Is my cat broken?

She does love Ruffles sour cream and cheddar chips though so there's that.
Get that cat some flea shampoo this instant!
Sweet dreams are made of these.

Who am I to disagree?
Don't think I've ever seen an animal wake with food in front of them and not eat it immediately. Used to do this with my dog all the time. 

Hmm... I suppose some humans are the same way. Every instance of having woke to pizza it's never been a pass.
my cat had fleas for a solid year- got monthly medication, vet visit, bug sprayed our home regularly, deep cleaned all fabric/carpet surfaces in our home, gave her a few torturous baths to no avail. our dog (who goes on 5 walks a day out in florida swamp) has been flealess with just regular medication. poor cat tore herself apart from the itchiness. she's finally recovering spontaneously and we never really figured out her problem. The people assuming owner neglect for what may or may not be a flea (and a not very lively one at that) on a well groomed cat and don't know the circumstances are a bit out of their lane imo
/r/WakingUpPetsWithFood

Someone make it, please.
*Goes back to sleep with shrimp in mouth*
This is the best thing about having pets, just being able to completely make their day in simple ways like this. "You know what, kitty? I feel like getting you high as balls today, let me go get the catnip out."
I think kitty has a flea on its leg. Make sure it getting it's flea and tick meds. Don't want that baby to itch or get sick.
u/savevideo
Is the shell still on the shrimp?
Your cat has fleas
[deleted]
Nobody going to mention that nasty ass flea crawling around?!
Epic video, so sweet. Gonna try this with my cat lol
Shrimp! Heaven! Now!
Wasn't sure if he was gonna actually wake up lol.
He was definitely eating shrimp in his dreams. 😂
Can't even log into reddit without having to see some sort of hardcore prawn video.
maybe...maybe dreams comes true
Adorbs ♥
Damn. This might be the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Cat：what is this!  Am i dreaming?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Waky waky
“Oh it was just a dr- YOOOOOOOOOOO!”
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen
I'd love to do this to my cat but I can't even look in the direction of the kitchen without her beating me there.
I am always amazed at how cats can eat directly after sleeping
I used to do this with my cat using Tuna.
I just love the way the cat sees it and just eats it...no confusion as to why it's there, where it came from, if it's for her/him!
looool, no hesitation *at all*
my dog does the exact samething btw
[I added some audio.](https://streamable.com/u0hmmh)
Sweet dreams are made of shrimp
Flea.
When I was waking up/half asleep I was thinking about getting some shrimp fried rice. Maybe I’m a meow too?
This is hilarious
Eat now, questions later.
Thank you. I love this. Made me remember how great it is to have a cat.
Love that the cat clearly smelt it and dreamt about eating it
This is awesome because usually when I have dreams like this, I wake up to disappointment
My grandmother used to feed her cat shrimp exclusively it almost killed him. A little is good too much is too rich for them evidently.
Great funny video, thanks for posting.
0:06-0:12. Hey I think you should check your little buddy for fleas.
When my dog is sleeping I place a treat in front of him like that, after like 2 seconds he wakes up sees the treat, eats and immediately goes back to sleep, and that’s hilarious!
I wanted to see the whole thing get eaten. It cut off too quick. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
I would do the same if I woke up with a fresh shrimp in my face tf
Best day ever!
A couple more, you could have yourself a cocktail.
BOOM! Manifested!
The last smell I awoke to was skunk, who had to have sprayed right outside my window!
now it's perspective of reality will be forever warped.
Exactly how I wake up in the morning.
My dog would’ve shat this out by the time this cat wakes up
u/manablight
>In the dream it was cut up into bite sized pieces, *but thanks.*  
  
-Cat
This is how i want to be woken up from now on
Proof that Animals do dream 💀 This man just made a scientific discovery
THE CAT WAS DREAMING ABOUT EATING HIS PEOPLE! SHRIMP WAS GOOD ENOUGH! THEY HAVE SATED HIS BLOODLUST FOR THE DAY
This guy is so cute dreaming of food and it appears and he went straight for it in case it was a dream.
Do you think the cat knows their owner gave them the treat or does the cat just think it fell from the sky?
Took the cat long enough to wake up. My dogs would've woken up before it touched down.
Lol he woke up like “oh shit snackie!” so cute
I would try this with my dog, but there is absolutely zero chance of my getting food, any kind of food, in my hands without her waking up and investigating it.
haha, he was dreaming he was eating it and then woke up and wella, there it was. Dream come true.
Holy shit it IS real!!!!
The cat just read “The Secret” and is now gonna be super annoying to his friends.
My cat would just look at it and wait for it to be cut into teeny tiny bite size pieces…
Haha awesome
Aw So cute. I had a cat but I lost him, I miss him so much.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
Nose is like "WAKE UP CAT! WAKE UP!"
And now this cat believes in the Law of Attraction.
I love the sweet little dreamland nom nom nom action before he wakes up.
People: “fuck no I wouldn’t eat insects”.  
Also people: “mmmm good shrimp”
Shrimp make my kitty make the "Sad Cat Noise" and bazooka vomit.
Man, snacks after you wake up from a nap are a different level of satisfaction.
u/pemols fazer com o kiko

The suspense
Lol, I can’t even be near my cat and she still asleep, she would wake up for extremely low noise !
Lol, I can’t even be near my cat and she still asleep, she would wake up for extremely low noise !
I so wonder how cats (and pretty much all animals on earth) dreams look like.
Like obviously it's dreaming about eating that shrimp, but what's the setting? What led up to the eating in the dream? 

Please write a 2-page size 12 essay on animal dreams. Due Friday.
how cute 😍
😂🤣😂🤣
So cute
So cute ❤️❤️😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
I’ve just arrived from r/prequelmemes after accidentally seeing some Anisoka. Phew boy, I needed this
Dreanming and eat kkkk
Hi
That was the happiest cat when it woke up, didn’t even ask questions just dove right in.
This is about as wholesome as it gets.
Cat wasted no time
That makes me wonder how long does a person need to go from dreaming to snap back to reality because I remember that sometimes my dad calling me I thought I was dreaming but then suddenly I wake up and I’m getting yelled at for sleeping too long
My rabbit does the same but with Bananas
Did anyone notice the flea on the cats paw? Just me? Ok.
Lets talk about that flea
Suppose you're thinkin' about a plate o' shrimp. Suddenly someone'll say, like, plate, or shrimp, or plate o' shrimp out of the blue, no explanation. No point in lookin' for one, either. It's all part of a cosmic unconciousness.
~A dream is a wish your heart makes~
That is just too cute.
Not a cat person (allergic to them) but how does that cat keep sleeping for so long? I open the peanut butter jar in the middle of the night and my dogs materialize like magic even if they were in another room dead asleep.
Smellception
Pretty sure the cat has fleas if the owner actually posted this
How do we know the cat is dreaming of shrimp
Not shelled? Savage!
Wow, animals are built differently, I could not just get up and eat, I would really need to survey my surrounding and remember who I am before doing so
Great. Now I want shrimp.
So after Eleanor Shellstrop walked through the gate at the end she was reincarnated as this cat. r/thegoodplace.

Precious!!
This is how it feels to wake up after a nights drinking and the first thing you see is a forgotten hangover pizza
You should put this on /r/animalsbeingderps
Don't let your dreams be dreams
u/cottonhusk
That huge flea on its leg at the beginning triggers me.

Manchmal werden träum eben wahr! 🙃
I know this feeling all too well. As a kid when you wake up hungry, ready to eat some stale cereal. You walk into the kitchen and your parents got some fucking M C D O N A L D S. Hard feeling to beat.
Why did you leave the skin part on?
That’s literally a dream come true. I wish someone would do that for me😂
It’s little mouth twitches 🥺😹😹
I had a cat that only ate shrimps.  Only food.  He refused any thing else.  He lived until he was 20
Shwimp :3
This is now my most favorite thing ever.
[deleted]
When dreams come true... instantaneously!
A dream is a wish your heart makes. When you’re fast asleep.
So precious 🥺🥺
r/shrimping
Cats are disgusting
Chill people, that is not a flea. Enlarge the video and look closer.
this is stupid ngl

Someone please link the shrimp gagging cat
This is lovely
Hahahaha
"omg, dreams DO come true"
“I can’t chew something this big!”
Love kitty's coloring
2 shrimps together
Adorable
Please make more with different foods for the good of mankind
How different are dogs and cats in terms of senses?  Do dogs just have better noses but cats have better eyes?
Great, now the cat thinks it has psychic powers
That cat just went through a whole lucid dream that it thinks it manifested!
Bro, you didn't peel the shrimp for him? That's gonna be a pain in the @** for this poor cat later on.
Step 1 wake up, Step 2 eat
Love it
:) 
I needed that smile today.
Dreams do come true
Reminds me as a kid when I used to dream I had chocolate in my hand and then being really disappointed in the morning when my hands were empty.
And at the end the cat was like “thank lord, wasn’t a dream” 😻
“It’s going to be a good day”
The definition of dreams come through 😂
So cats are just pro-seafood of any kind? I thought tuna was their specialty
Time to comb for fleas! (Lower right corner)
So cute. Made the kitty's day I bet

You win the internet today .... thank you for posting this :)
Gifs that ended too soon
I wish u could try this but my kitty doesn’t sleep through anything
What a nice idea. I wish I could wake up from my dreams and have it sitting in front of me. :)
It’s a dream within a dream
Did you know that smell is one senses that can not wake you up from sleeping?
mmm delcious dream shrimp
Yeah, there's no way my cat wouldn't immediate wake up when the shrimp was brought into the same room as her :D
zzzzz....mumble mumble mumble....CROMCH!
wow very sweet act this . i am happy to see this video.
Do cats dream of fried shrimp?
My dream came true!!
Kitty thought (s)he manifested it 🤣
Cuuuuteeee
Dreams can come true
Omg
I will call it “SHREAMD”
Curious if you only put food out while the animal is asleep would it learn to sleep more in order to get fed?
😍😍 sooo cute
Cat looks so lovely
That was great!
My cat would give me the evil eye if I gave him that.
I Love this !!!
Wow my cats never eat prawn
hello
I love doing this with my cat
Yay for the kitty 🐱
FUCKEN PRAHN
So cute
I go through this too ! Except when I open my eyes I’m staring at my wife’s ass 😗
Awww a baby ragdoll
I love the double take that the kity does
My cat would be ecstatic.
tail on?
This is the best video ever of all the internet! Never before such a clear example of our animal nature
☠️ Amazing
haha..so cute!
Wah this can't be real a shrimp I just dreeeaaaamed about nomming on one of these!
This is one of the best videos I've seen...Cat's are just majestic and adorable...
The cat said: Oh, do you know? In fact, I almost ate shrimp meat just in my dream. LOL
Lol. The joy of waking up and realizing it was not just a dream.
Lol
My cat doesn't eat anything that isn't kibble. She's the pickiest cat I've ever had.
Bummer.
My cat does the same with tuna :)
My dream has come true!  What a great life!
Dreams come true for those who believe in them 💫
Love this!
On the contrary, I would not enjoy waking up to a piece of shrimp right in front of my face.
That looked similar to me having night terrors.
Present!
Manifesting works!
/r/WakingUpPetsWithFood
Dreams *DO* come true!
And now that cat knows no sense of time or reality, even less than it did before
i thoughts crustacean food is bad for cats and dogs... idk
Looks just like my ragdoll! I never thought of giving her prawns. I wonder if she would like them too.
Fleas are currently fucking on your cute cat.
My cat literally only eats chicken, won't even eat seafood if it's wet cat food.
And then that dream was real
Did any one else see the flea?
Dream come true! Munchies activated!!!!
The cat looking left and right lol
Honestly thought it was my service provider having issues until I tried reddit
I wish someone would wake me up from naps like this
Fake. Cat was in on it and pretending to sleep. Not even that believable. Smh.
I just watched a dream come true
I read the title and "I can dream About You" by Dan Hartman started playing in my head.
Wake n' snack
Real question, is it boiled/steamed/grilled/raw?
Man this is Gold! Hahaha, beautiful little film 👌
This is how my girlfriend wakes me up from a nap
Now that's adorable 😍
Do cats know to not eat the tails?
Is that cooked or raw?
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
When dreams come true
My cat would wake up instantly 😂 also, do cats eat prawns?
Is that a flea on your cats arm?
Dream come true
I too would love to wake up with that in front of me
Cute
I could watch cats sleep all day. I love the little lip quivers, and noises. So cute!
Nom nom nom
Damn it Tinker, you won't believe this !!!!

There I was, dreaming about shrimp.  I wake up, and damned if there wasn't a nice juicy piece of shrimp laying there right in front of me.  Imma go back to sleep and dream about a shitload of catnip now.
What kind of kitty is this? It's so cute 🥺
Proof that dreams really do come true
It's like when your alarm ringtone incorporates itself into your dream except not annoying as fuck
Wonderful.
This is me trying to eat my dream with already fill stomach
I love when people spoil their cats!
I wanna wake up like that...
No you weren’t
Last time I woke up and just started eating, I almost got her pregnant.
Wouldn't happen in our house. The instant I take the prawns out of the fridge she is there. 

Sometimes I only have to think about doing it and she appears. Our cat maybe doing some jedi mind trick so I think it's my idea?
OMG those sleepy nom noms! So cute!
I was so happy when the kitty woke up and finally got to eat the shrimp of their kitty dreams!
Power of dreams
I love this ❤ so wholesome
Ohh GOD!!! He is so cute
SHRIMP! HEAVEN! MEOW!

^Whiskers, ^we ^can’t ^keep ^doing ^this…
This post deserves another 60k upvotes
There should be a reddit for sleeping animals waking up from smelling food.
I do this to my gf but with her jewel
Did that to an ex with 5am spaghetti. Funny how she just opened her mouth with the noodles on her lips. Said she was having a dream about eating nuggets with her sister
I'm happy to be graced by the slurping sounds of the cat and not a shitty overused song
Anytime anyone wants to do that to me with fresh baked cookies while I'm sleeping, go right ahead!
This bear award was the only one I had and omg does this deserve it 😸 what an awesome video, and adorable kitcat!
This reminds me of a video of a pig waking up for a cookie.
This kitty looks so happy after, probably best way to wake up
This by far the best video I’ve ever seen on this sub!! <3
I needed this. Thank you OP
Well, that’s probably the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
I wish someone did this to me when I dream of having a bunch of money in my pockets.
So fucking wholesome

Wouldn’t blame them, shrimp is pretty good if cooked right
Just gonna leave the tail on it like that, huh?
I wonder how much marine life died with this.
we need 100 guys to upvote this so i can say "nice"
Wow
Awww
So cute 😀
This happens all the time with humans, and with noises also.

They wake up convinced they have some sort of super power, because they dream it, they assume they made it happen.
Dreams come true 👐

Brain: huh something smells good let's dream about it

Nose: nah man you need to wake the fuck up right now we got a code shrimp in our hands
Aww 🥰
Ever dream of your heart's desire, and you can even sense it and you feel such joy. But you wake and it's not there and you grieve for this reality?

I'd imagine that cat experienced the opposite feeling.
r/shrimpmemes
Why didn't this work for my childhood?!
Cute
That cut though, the cat didn’t wake up right away. Some fake ass shit.
Little drool starting as her mouth waters. Lmao
So cute
I have done this with ham
Dreams do come true!
Haha i literally said aww and then looked at the subreddit name!
What about the shell? Is that ok for kitties?
Dreams do come true!!
“Oh Shit! A Shrimp!!” 😃
“Oh Shit! A Shrimp!!” 😃
"I've seen this one!"
My cat hated prawns for some reason…she loved sardines and meat but never touched prawns or calamari..wonder why
I want one < 3
I wonder if there would have been a quicker reaction if was salmon or another fish that was more aromatic, than cooked shrimp?.
>It's gonna be a good day, Tater.
Showed this to my girl first thing she says is “Flea detected on frontal appendage. Lazer armed.” That’s why I call her Lazer.
ROTFLMAO!!
Was that a flea
"you are not my real human, THIS IS ALL A DREAM"
A
"Yeah, I could eat"
Jiro!
Someone do this to me with a Thanksgiving dinner
God that is so FUCKING ADORABLE
I was thinking you were going to take it away before it woke
My little brother loved the pink panther when he was around 4, so after last day pf school I dropped by a shop and bought a dvd with a bunch of episodes. I went home and waved it in front of his sleeping-slightly open eyes, then left the room. Half an hour later he comes sprinting to me telling me about a dream where I bought him a new pink panther dvd.
Dreams DO come true!
I think I saw my brother do something similar last time we spent the night at our grandparents house
shrimps are okay for cats? my whole life i thought its not okay because it would cause them skin diseases. are they fine with eating squids too?
Somewhere inside that cat is the soul of Eleanor Shellstrop
Gorgeous cat
I do this with my dog, very wholesome.
Theres something wrong with that cat... Took too long to wake up
It’s s’cute when they’re eating
The little licks 😂😂😂
It's like hearing your alarm in the dream and being like oh cool, and then being like WAIT A MINUTE
Perfect.
What a cute cat
I love it !!!
My cat wakes up if a flea farts.. It's impossible to sneak up on her like that
Congratulations on 100.000 upvotes. It switched to 100k as I upvoted lol
I do this to my anxious cat when she's having a bad dream. Doesn't always wake her up but she chews air stops being agitated.
"hey, u interrupted my dream of eating shrimp!"
Dreams do come true!!
I’m happy that their dream come true
Basically how I need my coffee to work on the morning for me to get out of bed.
Gorgeous‼️ Dreams really do come true⭐️
What an amazing dream to waking transition.  Literally must be the greatest feeling 💯
I’ll never understand how animals can just wake up and eat like it’s nothing. I’d be groggy for 30 minutes and require a coffee…
Dream actually come true
Hahaha I love this!! Does it work with other food or just those little fishy smelling wonders?
Lol 😆 made me laugh, my cat doesn’t seem to be tempted by anything other than her biscuits. Never tried a prawn yet I’ll have to try
Kitty is going to be so happy when it wakes up!
The “hek hek hek” noise cats make when they’re eating is the best sound ever
I’m concerned that the shrimp shell is still on it. I’m assuming all is well, though.
Fookin prawns man
I want to do this to the girlfriend I don't have, with breakfast in bed.
hehe love this, I use to do that to my cat, little piece of fish and when he woke ... magic
haha, fluffy dreams
Whenever my bf naps while I’m making food for him, I like waving the plate in front of his nose. He wakes up and starts eating immediately lmao
Dreams can’t be buy
Manifesting at its finest lol
That would be Odie. Pip would snatch the shrimp before it hit the ground!!!
 I didn’t know cats eat shrimp. My cat is crazy about fish and didn’t care that much for chicken
Fat
My dream came true. Just like the prophecy was foretold.
Beerus Sama
Very cute!
I’m gonna have to try that it was cute
I was so scared they'd take it away before the cat awoke.
Shrimp
Do you think it told its friends about this wild paranormal thing that happened to it?
You can see flea on its leg at the beginning
I wish all my dreams would come true like that.
The kitty has a flea.
Hello, Eleonor!
