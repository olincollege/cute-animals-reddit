He is quite handsome.
He looks so majestic
Hello, handsome!
For how long he's been playing CSGO?
Looks like he's working on his Simba!
Tell him if he takes a deep breath and slowly blows air out of his mouth with loose relaxed lips, he can achieve a fuller lip effect.
He looks like my kitty Louies brother!!
Strong game already!!
He looks like a young Ron Purrlman
R/aww  keep going you are doing great!

Crimson chin looking ass
He certainly lives up to his name, he is indeed great. Although you missed out on an opportunity to call him Catsby
Damn, that’s a [pretty cat](https://i.imgur.com/wwOviyu.gif )
That is one good looking and handsome cat and he knows it, but manages not to look smug, just proud. Very fitting name for him!
I dont mean this in a mean way, but your cat looks like fried chicken.
Hey it’s me
Your cat looks like Samwise Gamgee, and I’m here for it
What’s his k/d?

Orange cats are the best! [Here's my big golden boi.](https://i.redd.it/yy2pqan716051.jpg)
My baby is called Gatsby too! She's all black and has a little white patch where a bow tie would be
was feeling like shit today and this is the only thing that kept showing up on my feed and honestly it has calmed me down. thank you Gatsby
How does it feel to have over 19 thousand people basically wanting your cat? Seriously that's a cute cat.
Awww I love his chubby chin.  Our late ginger boy Tiggy had a chubby chin. It was the best.  Give Gatsby extra scritches for me!
Hey my cat is named [Gatsby](https://i.imgur.com/PFf0jXD.jpg) too!
That cat is a total babe magnet.
Would this guy be as cute if his name was Bill or Marty? Gatsby is the perfect name.

I had a cat named Gatsby and he was missing his tail and sat upright like a person with his tongue hanging out and we highly suspected he was inbred and maybe mentally challenged.
Cats like him have a 100% to steal your girlfriend
The best cat face ever
Man, what a great Gatsby.
You mean "Steal yo girl" Gatsby.
Gotta say - I’m jealous I’ve never thought of that name for my pets. Great pet name
Your cat has a stronger jaw line than I do.

He is a very handsome man. Is he well mannered as well?
Aww

does he stand on the dock to look at the green light?
adorableeee 😍💕
He could pass off as another Ron Pearlman
“I was within and without, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible variety of life.”
What breed is that?
Give himb CHIMKEN!
He looks very polite  :)
Idk man he doesn’t seem like he has a bullet in him, we can fix that of course
He's looking quite Regal!
For a split second I didn't notice Gatsby's feet and immediately imagined it doing a cobra stretches stretch exercise!! 😇😸
Looks like Mufasa

Young Ron Perlman

Before I looked at the imagine, I saw the title and imagined some cat putting his paw on a mouse playing CS:GO

Looked at the image, still not disappointed.
He looks exactly like my Simba except Simba has one of his ears folded cause his last owner didn't take care of his ear mites when they should've.
Beautiful orange fluff 😻 reminds me of the sweet stray that bonded with me
I wish I had Gatsby confidence.
Looking into his eyes I suddenly feel like everything is going to be okay.
Hes gorgeous!
Working eh? I say he's got it down
He looks so proud of himself!
What a beautiful House Lion!

Lookin quite cute today ol' sport.
Ohhh...we’re off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of Oz!
What an incredible cat! My gf and I have a cat of the same type (not sure on what you call this), but she is smaller and a spoiled manipulative fatass who’s totally obsessed with food. One time she managed to get into the tote we keep her food in. We awoke the next morning to find her near comatose having eaten half the bag. Luckily we were able to transport her outside before she burst. I used a dolly to slide under her as to not disturb her too much. I knew a gastrointestinal nightmare would unfold very soon. We got her to the patio and into the garden where the gates of hell were opened. Think punctured IV bag. It went on that way for about a day. We made sure she had shade and plenty of water. She was fine the next day but I really thought she had killed herself with food. She also ate half a zebra cake one time.
PROUD.
His little smile is too adorable!! 😻
He’s so proud!
Awww he looks like a good boy
That’s a full blown smile if I ever saw one!
He looks so kind and supportive 😭 So incredibly precious

When I was in undergrad, I rescued two kittens with a friend. One got adopted to a girl who named him Gatsby, and I imagined he would grow up to look like this! They were two of the sweetest little kittens. Where ever you got this cutie, I'm going to pretend like it's the same little Gatsby and I'm happy to see he's so healthy and pretty :)

What's his k/d ratio?
Does Gatsby have an Instagram? I need to see more of him lol.
My mind read this as Catsby. Missed opportunity OP.
“He smiled understandingly-much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced--or seemed to face--the whole eternal world for an instant, and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor. It understood you just as far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself, and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.”
He looks like a cat Seth Rogen
So handsome
He looks like he’s Diamond Widow main for sure. He clicks heads.

“He smiled understandingly--much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life."
