Looks photoshopped. The light on cat looks superficial.
Either that cat is huge or those steps are tiny or it‚Äôs photoshopped.

Everybody wants to be a cat because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at

Why is this subreddit 85% photoshops now?
Isn't that where the picture of Hitler was taken?
Nazi cat
Nazi cat
Work on those Photoshop skills bud
I feel I've seen this before
Sorry to disappoint but this is photoshopped.
The shadow is blurry and fake, the stairs are much shorter IRL than the cat, his paws don‚Äôt fit the ramp.
Am I the only one that can't figure out the tail?
What the fuck happened to its tail
It‚Äôs been a minute since this was last posted.
So is this just a bot account or did you just find this shopper image somewhere OP? No response and it‚Äôll just confirm it is a bot.
Ugh. This is an example of Instagram mentalities spilling over into Reddit. It's over 

Fuck your photoshop for karma
Photoshop, his shadow projects on the background and his stomach is all blurry, same with his tail. How does this shit get over 35k upvotes
No one gonna talk about it‚Äôs fucked up tail
What's so cut about a nazi cat in Paris?
Heil Kitler
This is obviously and badly photoshopped
I mean it‚Äôs clearly photoshopped but I just love that fat little baby!
Definitely photoshopped, but it‚Äôs cute.
Lmao reposted a photoshopped image
What the hell is going on with his tail?  Looks like a duck growing out of him.
What happened to its tail ?
Idc if its photoshopped look at him
Hitler did the same thing in Paris
When cats from the Nazi occupation alter the Parisian cat gene pool.
https://i.imgur.com/xARt8s5.gif
Looks like a Hitler march
My first thought was like "how the fuck did you manage to take that picture". My second thought was "oh".
And the ramp on the left side is crooked. Photoshop fail.
This pic is photoshoped and badly
So that‚Äôs what happened to Thomas O‚ÄôMalley!!
its omalley from the aristocats

Omg this is amazing. Our cat razzle dazzles from time to time 2

That cat looks so hilariously French.
Everyone (now and the cat) has a photo next to the Eiffel tower except me. It destroys me a little bit mentally

"Everybody wants to be a cat!"
I'm starting to think about getting a cat
Un chat
This looks like it‚Äôs from a Disney movie and the cat is singing about how being a street cat isn‚Äôt that bad.
The cat looks like leo walking

If hitler had a cat, this photo would been taken in the 40‚Äôs
Fake AF look at the shadow underneath kitty
WHY SHOULD I WORRY,
WHY SHOULD I CARE-E-AIR-E-ARE!!!!
I thought this was referencing the picture of Hitler in front of the Eiffel Tower after the Nazis conquered France because the cat was raising his arm for a Nazi salute, and I violently breathed out of my nose, but then realized this was posted on r/aww and was confused. Anyway this will either be removed or downvoted into oblivion.
Where's this?

Very cute.
Pepe le Pew would be all over that.
Consider me charmed!

If this cat gets painted black with a white stripe there is a skunk that will chase her all over the city.
Cute French P**sy, although I hear they stink.
Why do i have the starting song of Wall E in my head when looking at this

Who cares? I don't get why so many people have to knit pick a photo. Just enjoy the bloody thing and call it a day.
Lol dirty lil feets
Thomas O'Malley!?
"Boo hoo this is photoshopped"

So what? It's still an adorable picture.
That cat is all like "can you read this note, I can't read english".
Cuteness aside, with the news of cats catching COVID-19 and people fearing that cats might spread it to humans, I fear for this cat's wellbeing and safety.
If aliens are monitoring us for whether we might be the next space faring race to join their federation, they probably think we worship cats. 

Side note, we need cats in little federation uniforms.
Now what happens when it falls?
