Again, cat lottery won.

Lulu is one of the most precious things I’ve ever seen. Protect her at all costs!!
Lulu takes her time but sure delivers! Practices social distancing too
I love this cat more than my own life
*There once was a feline retriever*

*Who was a true overachiever*

*To prove OP's boasts*

*Took two separate posts*

*And two slippers - - now I'm a believer*
why are you wearing my babies on your feet human?
The cutest, if not the most efficient!
Lulu aside,

Your mum has has the most mum voice ever.
Oh wow! My cat's original name was Lulu!  Is she a Maine Coone?
Did you have to wait until next morning?
As a Lulu, I think it’s great what this kitty is doing for us Lulu’s
Totally was not expecting a cat 😆
Close enough!
For all the Lulu updates follow her here 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Luluthecat/
this is awesome
That cat is a spirit guide 😆
I fucking love lulu
What the fuck is my cat doing with its lives?
Her little mews killed me. What a precious little helper you have there
Someone tell Lulu to bring back my dad please. He left for lotto tickets awhile back and still hasn't returned.
I halp.
Wtf. Best cat ever. Looks adorable, sounds adorable, fetchs shit.
She said “😽👞”
best sequel since shrek2
Part two?! Dreams come true!
Better than Lady and the Tramp!!
my life is now complete

good bye world
I wish my cat was this good.


Edit: She just but me.
Cat with a dogs brain
No more quarantine, go outside my lady! 🤣
I love her ❤️
Aww, such a good kitter.
Oh neat I have the same socks
I would die for lulu
Close enough!
This is my favorite
Cutest cat
Oh my god!!! If I had any gold to give you I would this is so freaking cute!!!!!!
Awe
That's it, I'm dead.
Such a very good cat!!!!
"Oh Lulu you're such a good girl"
Lulu: "Well now i'm not doing it"
Soon Reddit will be filled with videos of this cat... part 3, part 4, part 5....
I would die for Lulu
Awesom cat.
Damn I love that cat!
I love Lulu
Wow! Way to go, Lulu!
Does she get a snack for this?
I love when cats put things in their mouth and carry them oh my god 🥰
I have a cat that looks just like that and she’s so cute!
Those socks are Champions ™
I was 100000% certain Lulu was going to be a dog
Lulu you are such a good girl!
I LOVE LULU
Good job, thought you only had one leg.
Wait a minute, I thought I was Lulu D:
So my WiFi sucks and the video was lagging, but I was eagerly awaiting there to be an animal of sorts coming around the corner. Was not expecting a cat, and was not disappointed. I love him.
This cat put more effort in than Bernie voters.
Cutie! Does she fetch hair ties?
I was completely expecting a dog. This was even better.
 This was the only sequel I ever wanted
For a cat, that’s like being served dinner by a 5 star chef.
Such a sweetheart!
Thank goodness there was a part 2, I was beginning to get anxious!
Lazy cat didn't complete the job
Is she a Maine Coon?
What race this cat is?
Omg this cat is so precious!!! Protect it at all costs!!!!!
Wow its barely even April and Doom Eternal has already been surpassed as the best sequel this year.
Not to be anything but I'd die for Lulu.
My cat loving heart just melted
Your LuLu looks almost exactly like my buddy Gizmo (RIP). Just as loud too
I love Lulu 😭😭
YES!!!!
Oh she is so friggin pretty
I was seriously waiting for the second slipper!
But when is the other shoe gonna drop? WHEN?
Omfg. I love Lulu. All my cats bring me is dead chipmunks and leaves-like those things matter!

BRING ME SLIPPERS, TEDDY AND DC!!
“I’ve got your slipper, now feed me human”
Your mom is right, Lulu IS such a good girl :)
Now that’s a good cat
Look at that potato
Awwww.  My prior cat's name was Lulu.  

[Here is a picture of her in her twilight years](http://i.imgur.com/u8VhrgM.jpg)
This was filmed in reverse, don't believe the lies.
Okay. Awesome cat. But is no one else saying that’s not a slipper? It’s more like boot! I feel like
I’m taking crazy pills!
Kajhit brings wears
Dogs are probably rolling their eyes on these videos.
OMG SHE IS SO FLUFFY
"Lulu, you're such a good girl." "I am?!" *gets exited, drops the slipper too early*
I think I love you..... lulu
This is the EXACT opposite of what my cat does. He steals blankets, laundry, and other soft items and then drags them elsewhere in the house. It's not awesome.

Turns out everyone in our home was blaming the other 4 people- assuming some jerk (or the one small child) was dragging random items around the house- and just leaving them wherever. It wasn't until we all arrived home together from a dinner one evening when we see the 8lb cat dragging an entire Queen-sized comforter down the hallway that we realized what was going on. 

That fuzzy bastard steals anything that's soft,fabric and not nailed down and drags it wherever the hell HE wants it. And he never wants it in the hamper, the washing machine, on the bed or in a drawer.
Lulu for president.
The true question is, how in the HECK do I make my cat do that?
Soo heavy for tha beebee
Puss WITH boot!!! 😂
Awe. I love Lulu’s meow.
The sweetest meow I’ve ever heard. 🥰
I cooed out loud. That’s how adorable this is.
Such a good kitty.
Now GTFO out my house
Good dog Lulu
Slipper 2: electric boogaloo
Lulu you da real mvp
We gotta get your mom some new Bombas socks.
That’s adorable I just watched part one on r/all and then switched to rising and saw this!
THANK YOU FOR PART TWO
u/vredditdownloader
The first one was adorable but now I know this is a loyal cat, good kitty
Name a better sequel. I dare you.
Dogs: Well, at least it wasnt the news papers. Thats our job, fool!
Lulu really delivered on this one.
Lulu the real mvp
The perfect floof
Wow! The sequel is even better!
The only thing my cat brings me is dead lizards.
“Hurry up bitch I have a snack appointment”
Best sequel ever.
Ah, good. An update.
Get a load of this simp /s
The sequel
wholesome af
Oh thank you! We were left with a cliffhanger.
Lol. A dog would have dropped it at your feet, "Here you go sir, is there anything else I can get you?"

A cat says, "fuck you, you get it, I've done my job."
The cat so nice they named her twice~
I love you Lulu!!!
u/vredditdownloader
Lulu is good in fetching :)
What a sweet baby!!!
Thanks, tell Lulu I would die for her.
Sounded like the cat from the matrix
I’m always excited for a sequel, and always let down half way through.
Expecting a dog, got a cat. Maybe they’re not so evil after all. Or maybe that’s just why they want me to think...
Good kitty *scratches behind ears*
Hey I want ur car
She loves your mum, such a sweet kitty
You really need smaller slippers to make it easier for her. :)
Plot twist: It’s filmed in reverse.
I swear you stole my cat. :-D  
[https://youtu.be/diOxa1jGQmk](https://youtu.be/diOxa1jGQmk)
I may be watching too much Twitch. Though a French bulldog was going to bring a slipper to a Brit in Brighton.
This looks like Lulu from kittiasaurus with longer fur
Hey can anyone help me with my gofundme? Please
My cat loves to play fetch. She also learned to growl from our dogs.
My good kitty is a lulu too.
I love your cat. That's all.
“Hey mom, you left your weird kittens in the other room again. Imma drop them off for you. As way of thanks, maybe put the snack that you are eating in the cat now.”

Sincerely, The Cat.
That.....meow...it was like a perfect copy of the cat from the matrix that shows up when there’s a glitch in the matrix....
Maine Coon?
Thou call this a slipper?
I'd be down for a daily post of Lulu bringing you these slippers
Aww I love the name Lulu, so fucking cute!! And what a beautiful kitty too, she’s gorgeous
Ok but why are your slippers basically boots
Lulu Delivery Service! 💖
"Ok humin here's you're other...... ah fk it close enough"
That cat would get a dog bowl to eat from if it was my cat.
I can't handle the cuteness!
u/vredditdownloader
That's one rectangular foot
“Now get the fuck out of here, you been here too much”
u/vredditshare
You have one squarely shaped foot
Block foot
Thats not a slipper
2 stickers.
Wait- I saw this two times
r/unexpected
This is getting out of hand, now there are two of them!
Newbies. What you need to do is get multiple toys. When cat brings the toys but leaves a few feet away you chuck out one from your supply. Gather scattered toys when you get up, ready for next round.
The queen returns
Aww isn't she just the cutest kitter catto! The goodest goil! Such a sweet catto.
OMG!!! My first pair of uggs. I would take them off at the door, we were in a three story condo. I would always find one missing or on the second or third level. They were never chewed on or slobbered up. So of course mind went straight to my German Shepherd puppy, we had a little sit down talk about not eating or chewing my uggs. And still days after days I’d find them moved. So weird. One day I took my pup to get neutered very early in the am and took my shoes off at the door when I got home as normal. I went back to bed. When I woke up one of the Ugg’s WAS IN MY BED! The dog was at the vet though?!? Then my attention turned to right next to the ugg. The freakin cat! Maybe 4 months at the time. It was the only answer! That darn Pico de Gato (that’s his name)
Wouldn’t recommend wearing that shoe after. Kind of gross.
[deleted]
Lulu is indeed the best of girls. 🧡🧡🧡
That high pitched meow 😭😭😭😭
Lulu found out later that she was a cat.
She's the best!
Good dog!
Here is your foot cloze.  I haz pooped in it for you.
This is so freaking cute! Tell lulu I love her!
Boot too big
Good Weegie!
She’s a perfect blend of two fosters I had. She looks like Cocobear and sounds like Sweet Pea. Lulu, you’re melting my heart, baby girl.
I think the neighbors heard me yell the sub name
She’s telling you something,  it’s her house, now walk!

I can sleep in peace now.

Ahhaahhah is cute

I love Lulu
huh so that's why all the shoes in the US are shaped like burritos for duck feet

people on the US have some fucking weird shaped wide feets
My cat does this with my socks 🖤 Manages to get into my hamper and separately brings me the matching pair.
She couldn't take the stench anymore, that's why she didn't bring it all the way to you
Data from TNG: LULULULU
if i have the coins, i would definitly give you a gold haha
why would your slippers be not near your bed if you wore them prior to going to sleep though? does lulu take them to a designated 'slipper repository' overnight or something
Adorable.
Lulu wins the internet today. Yay Lulu!!
I love this cat
Hahan
That's a girl that gets the job done!
I did not expect that and I want to squish that kitty with lovin’s so much!!!

Need to look for part one now
Do you wear socks to bed like a MONSTER???
The world need more Lulu right now.
I love her
Is that a cat or a dog!
Not to be dramatic, but I’d die for Lulu.
I think  you can walk over and pick up your other slipper. She did all the work!
I think after today, The Legendary Lulu. These two videos are the best thing I've seen all week, probably longer.
At least she tried
The sequel I’ve been looking for!
We need more LuLu’s in this world
She’s so cute
Lulu is a dog!!
My Basset Hound is named Lulu and she loves to steal my socks.
Wait. I saw this with different title posted 2hr earlier, so I am confused.
So precious!!
Gimme that cat.
Totally expected her to steal the boot on your foot after return the one she already stole.
*Those* are slippers?

Damn. Those are some fancy "slippers" ..., 🤨
“I am a dog”
I was expecting a service dog. Ngl. It's a pleasant surprise though
Human: "Lulu, you're such a good girl."

Lulu: "I know..."
Thank you for getting the other slipper, Lulu, you pretty kitty.
THAT MEOW 🥺🥺🥺
Lulu I would die for yuyu
I appreciate you
That's not a slipper! That's a cat!
Lol
☺️
I donno, Lulu kinda phoned it in on that second slipper
Your mom is a champion
Really had to milk that karma with a part 2 smh
This is ADORABLE. That triumphant meow 💕
Almost called you out earlier. Glad a shut my mouth.
u/vredditdownloader
u/vredditdownloader
Can we please get these posts every day? Please.
Haha that’s adorable
She's so cute
She is so beautiful 😍
my cat does this as well! she’s an indoor cat and we’ll wake up in the morning and she’ll have brought a bunch of towels and doll clothes upstairs to the living room as gifts. she starts around 11pm and screams when she brings something up every few hours lol
Myyyy darling angel cat is ALSO named Lulu!
Lulu wants to bring you everything. She thinks that if she brings you those things they will get a good life like she is experiencing. 🐱
I would sell my soul for my cat to do that.
I love her so much!!
Did you mean

#Morning slipper Part 2: Electric BoogaLulu
This is insanely cute. The way shes pridefully walking like she's just doing her job. 

lol I like to think she goes off to lounge around the rest of the day after putting in her 10 second shift and just thinks "I earned this."
That cat is a gem!
Oh my god she's so majestic
Awwwww!!!! ❤️
r/ntbdbiwdfta
Que hermosa, comentario random en español xd
She looks like my sister's cat
lulu! use your geass so you can escape the chains of oppression!
I do want this cat.
Is that a Russian Siberian breed?
Is lulu part Maine coon, or is she a rag doll???
"All was going well, and then you had to go and say something, huh? Well, I now have to answer you, and I can't do it with a mouth full of slipper, can I? Fine, I'm going to drop it here and you go get it. That'll teach you to keep your mouth shut."

Lulu, I imagine.
Aww Lulu!
/r/ntbdbiwdfta
That’s so cute I could cry!
that is adorable....how did she train the cat to bring her slippers? I am trying to train my cat and so far it seems more like she is training me. So far my cat will give me her paw like high five or shake hands but she only does anything for temptations treats......if i dont have them she looks puzzled and walks away.
Omg!!!! My cat’s name is lulu too and she plays fetch!!!!!!!!! 😭 
No one believes me but it’s real I have vids and it’s soooooo cute.
That slipper is a boot
How?!
I thought that they were UGGs at first. I was gonna have to ask where the North Face coat, Starbucks cup and leggings were.
Maybe the Japanese got it from the deer
I got so excited to see the followup that I said, "Ooh, Lulu Part 2!" Apparently I must have shouted it because both my kids and my husband came running to see the video. And everyone enjoyed it
THIS HAS 69,000 UPVOTES HOW AND NICE
Lulu looks a lot like my Stormy.

An attempt was made
My cat just steals my chapstick and hits it under the fridge.
I would fucking die for Lulu
Terrible human that is heavy!
My cat does this except he rapes the shoe first and howls about it whilst he brings it downstairs.
So weird, I *just* [posted a comment](https://old.reddit.com/r/therewasanattempt/comments/fua3sa/to_return_toilet_paper/fmchwy6/) about my cat that came into my room at 4am meowing loudly and dragging a bag of old potatoes. My cat looked and acted just like the one in this vid.
Lulu's meow is so adorable
Aww
u/vredditdownloader
Thanks for the follow-up, but also can we talk about how these are not slippers?
What a good kitten
YASSSS
Eh close enough
/u/vreddit_player_bot
I want LuLu in my life.
What an absolute sweetheart!
Tip ya waitress
How does it feel dog lovers?
She places it down so gently 😭
Her sweet little voice!
My cat just screams at the top of the stairs until I go and see what he has "caught" (usually something out of the waste paper basket).
Oh thank god the second video was uploaded I legitimately have been thinking about if she gets the second slipper all day
My mom has a Yorkie named LuLu
So precious
Is that a maine coon or just a cat with longer hair than usual?
i think your feet might smell
That meow sounds so much like my cat
Good kitty!!
Lulu! Love her.
OP fuckin' delivers

edit: the cat too, I guess
"Lulu, you're such a good girl"
 "Yeah!"
Why do parents always have boxes of file folders sitting around? Is it taxes? It just seems like a parents’ bedroom staple.
I haz it!!
Awwww.  How sweet! Shes so fluffy, I just want to snuggle her!
That’s pretty amazing!
I was listening to queen-we are the champions and as the cat walked in Freddie just went “WWEEEEEE ARE THE CHAMPIONS MY FRIENDS *bum *bum* AND WE’LL KEEP ON FIGHTIIIIING TILL THE END”
Ay Lulu is such a good girl
Very cat
Lulu asked CatReddit how to get her hooman out of the house so she can throw a roaring 20s party  with her furry friends, in her new home. Lots of suggestions, but this was the best one.
You... taught your *cat* to... fetch your shoes? That’s... that’s pretty impressive.
I don’t know about anyone else but this is the sequel that had to happen.
You stole my cat!

One of my old friends had a baby kitten who loved to hide in my shoes
I honestly thought this was a play on, "being Fauci." But this is still incredibly cute.
Damn Lulu is buffed ᕙ(  • ‿ •  )ᕗ
Was not expecting Lulu to be a cat omg how precious!! She’s beautiful 🥰🥰🥰
She's so cute!
OMG one of my cat’s name is Lulu too! Never heard of another cat being named Lulu. ((:
Thank you Lulu!

#EVERYONE SAY THANK YOU LULU
I think we need a smaller slipper.
I’ve been waiting for this video ever since I saw the first.
i was honestly wondering where the other slipper was. thank you for this update! lol
Tree trunk
Serious question here: Is there a “cats carrying things” subreddit?
here is your birfday present. It’s a little late but dats ok.
I cannot express in words what a good girl she is.
I thought it was RIP Lulu.

Why does she look like a cute version Mrs Norris?

We need more from Lulu!! Please!
She looks like my cat who ran away Josie, such a good old girl 😺
What an amazing cat!
I'm a professional cat translator, she said "thank you"
Glad you posted this, I was wondering about the second slipper....  
But omg, cutest thing I've seen in a while!
Does she take them out of them room at night?
“What do you think I am some clown for your amusement? Fine here’s your other boot now give me pets and turn that camera off.”
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Lulu.
thanks lulu
Your cat is the best!!!!!
That’s a good kitty
Soooooo much better than part 1 😂😂😂
I thought it said stripper, and I was like damn I'm gona lose all my bands
Omg she's precious 😭
Luv me some lulu
An attempt was made
Oh my laawd my heart's melting.
I don't know Lulu, but I love her!
Well that's the cutest shit I have seen in awhile
i love you lulu 😭
Lulu probably did it only to get food. Smart cat
aww I love Lulu❤️
LMAOOOOOOOOOOO 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
haha i roared as that 2nd one came around the corner
Jealous isn't a good enough word for how I feel. I WANT LULU 😭
I love her smushy face when she holds the slipper in her mouth.
THIS JUST KEEPS GETTING CUTER AND CUTER
I'm so glad that this exists.
I was wondering if she brought both slippers thanks for the update
Dood get smaller slippers you monster!
Is that a Maine Coon? It's so chatty. And fluffly, of course.
She thinks mom wears her victims as shoes, and has mad respect. IMO
This is the greatest sequel ever created
I stand corrected
It confirms the theories in the first post : she is slowly getting her human to go to the kitchen.
Evidences : the first slipper was closer to the human, only one step was needed. But is was the first step, the most important one. It doesn't need to be a big one, but it needs to happen.... Yes... The human has taken the bait. Now put the second slipper just few inches away, so human had to move a bit more... Yes, great success. Now that your buttocks is off the bed for good... FEED ME SLAVE !
She is so precious. I love her.
I am prepared to die for Lulu.
Siberian cat?
Day 14: The food slave continues to ignore the large brown furry creatures I bring it as sustenance every morning. Given the ease of which I catch them you’d think the idiotic creature would have no problem consuming them. Instead it insists on standing upon them and moving them to a different area. I have come to the conclusion that it is simply stupid.
[deleted]
Oh my heart
I have those same socks.
I’m pretty sure everyone was expecting a dog.
LULU!!  mrrrehhh mrrrehh
I didn’t see Part One, but when it started, I was thinking “I hope it’s a cat I hope it’s a cat I hope it’s a cat” and then an audible “Ohh!”. Thank you, I needed this tonight.
I’m abouta go to the shelter - this is too 🥺
She is so wonderful OP! What a helpful kitty!
We gotta protect sweet Lulu with our lives yo
Cheered me up no end. Thanks for sharing...

Since I didn’t see the first post, I was just expecting a dog!! Jaw actually dropped...
Went into this expecting a dog, but OMGH kitty cat. I love this.
She’s tired lol
The other shoe has finally dropped!  I was wondering about that.
Thank you OP
Your cat is cooler than my dog...  What in the absolute fuck? lol

Not to be dramatic, but I would die for this cat.

Best sequel of 2020 calling it rn
Close enough
Lulu deserves the world
LULU IS A GOD
Lulu teaching you a life lesson.
I would fight for Lulu to be safe.
As a non American person.

1) that's not a slipper. That's boots.
2) why do yall wear shoes indoors especially when its carpeted?
Yall dont care about yall healthy, hygiene, and lungs?

This reminds me, somebody commented in reddit saying US is decent in hygiene but then I see people wearing dirty shoes in house, how is that even close to decent hygiene?
Ugly ass feet meets ugly ass cat meets ugly ass boots
