Don't know how the owner managed not to laugh during the zoomies.
Point A - ZOOMIES - Point B
*I added a step, see if you can notice the difference*
Aw man, this needs sound.
Well …he did sit.
*The Ministry of Silly Walks approves*
*I DID GOOD I DID GOOD I DID SO GOOD I WAITED AND SAT UNTIL YOU CALLED ME AND THEN I CAME TO YOU I DID SO....*

Sees her face

*Oh. I forgot the last part.*
I used to compete in Schutzhund nationally and help train people to train their dogs.

Whoever taught her how to train her dog did an excellent job. None of it is forced, the dog is willingly complying. 

I'm not sure if this is a mock trial, some other obedience event, or an official Schutzhund B event, but further stages are age-restricted as the dogs mature. This would not be allowed in later trials but it shows that the dog has an eagerness to please and obey and that she is keeping training fun.
Nailed it.
Nothing wrong with a little personal flair. He did it way better than alllll the other pups. 💜
Full marks!
Typical boxer 😍 my girl is like bambi in a field lol
Those is just boxer tings
Brilliant. That's my kinda dog. Personality 100%
Yeah but to be fair no one said it couldn’t do it with FLAIR! And Pizzazz!
What are they training for?
This is how I walk everywhere.  I see no problem here. 10/10
17/10 for style!
Human: "Step1 stay. Step2 run. Step43 sit."

Dog: "What about steps 3-42"

Human: "Improvise"
He did a good job, 10/10 good boy
*Any asshole dog can run up and sit, but can they do "THIS" Karen?*
**50 points to Gryffindor**
Straight savage.
Boxers, essentially cocaine in Dog form.
Boxer? Boxer.
It's a boxer. Its operating as expected.
Video with sound on youtube. Not sure if this was linked or not. 

https://youtu.be/p2YVMTbhZqc
He thought it was a dance recital and had some new moves to show off.
My husband has been wanting a boxer for years and I've been saying no.  This changed my mind.  I need this kind of derp in my life 🤣
Instruction unclear; become tornado?
Sometimes enthusiasm gets control and I have to dance ! Very typical boxer move.
+ 10 points for style.
Can we get one with sound please?
r/maliciouscompliance
And THIS is why I love boxers!! This doggo is the embodiment of the breed; they are the spazziest, lovable and loyal dog you will ever have! I have had 2 in my life. I lost my girl Izzy last year - she was my bff for 12 great years!! I miss her dearly. But I don't have the heart to have another - I will see her in heaven because that is where she is. :)
Boxers are the funniest people...
We have a winner.
https://i.imgur.com/lbEWDZF.gifv
I would be so proud if that was my doggo
Boxers are the greatest
What a great job from a great doggo
Excellent style!
Some dogs sit. Some sit with pizzazz.
He is the goodest boy in the contest, I'm sure
Extra points for style?
No one said what the dog could or could not do during the run.  :)
Well, he’s a boxer, soooo...
Tries to squeeze in some quick zoomies hoping noone would notice
if the task is to simply *run up and sit*, how else would you differentiate yourself from the competition?
Entertaining and obedient...what a good boi
Would those be slammy whammies or zoomies? Or the hitherto unlabeled category, zoomy whammies?
Boxers are high energy with goofy personalities.
I his defense, he did all that. He just couldn't help throwing in a few whirly zooms on top of it. I give him 10/10 for originality.
He tried running so fast that he looked like a giraffe on the startup.
Perfect execution!
Best In Show right there. Everyone else can go home.
I feel kinda sorry for the lady, but the damn goofball is having a blast.
Owner: "Come"

Doggo: "RODEOOOOO!"
10/10
Dedication 9000
you left me there for a FULL HOUR! I'm so glad to be with you again.
Nailed it.
And he did exactly that. Perfect score.
I love boxers.
Boxers are the goofiest dogs
Seems about right for a boxer...
Flawless.
That's a ~~Tigger~~ *Boxer*

You're lucky it didn't bounce up expecting her to catch it for love and snuggles. The fact it only spun around a few times and then actually sat is a damn miracle.
He put his own spin on it.
When you're a boxer and all those years of pent up urge to chase your tail despite having none finally become too much.
His head couldn't keep up with that launch. It was like a cartoon. lol
When I was taking a dog training class at one point we had to stand at the other side of the room from our pup and tell him to come. Some of the dogs ignored the command or wandered off, others actually made it across the room to their proud owners. My dog however bolted towards me at top speed; initially I was impressed he understood enough to head in my direction, especially with so many potential distractions along the way. As I'm standing there smiling, expecting to be one of the few that successfully completed the activity, my dog reaches me (he still hasn't slowed down at this point), and bolts right past and out the open door that was behind me. It only led into a stairwell but it cracked all of us up. I have no idea what he expected to find in there, but it's definitely one of my favourite moments from his training.
It's like his head wasn't ready for all that acceleration.
I mean, it *is* a boxer, so that was actually very restrained.
You can practice everyday for months and take your dog to all the classes and this stuff still happens. Dog shows even host "fun matches" that are basically like practice shows for puppies to get experience and for people to practice obedience and agility in this type of setting, but when it comes down to it, dogs are gonna dog.
 
I went to my first obedience trial when I was probably 10 or 11 and saw a Bernese Mountain dog take off from his owner, jump out of his ring and into another ring because he saw another Bernese Mountain dog. He literally just wanted to visit.
My Boxer has a nice control of her zoomies but when she has them holy crap. She's either jumping over something a car, couch, or a small child. Or she's pretending to be a greyhound mixed with a cheetah.
Good boy!
Think the dog gave himself whiplash.
this should be on the never celebrate too early compilations
Pure excitement
Doggy jazz hands
Im dead, that did the thing. It stopped me from breathing.
“Miscalculated zoomies amount”
All I see here is extra credit
The dog equivalent of doing a donut into a parallel parking spot. He just added some sweet ass style
I own a boxer. This is the best trained boxer ever.
Had a boxer for years and she was the exact same way. Lol
Nailed it!
I expected no less from a boxer :>
That is exactly what that dog did. She ran up and sat. She just did it in the most Boxer way possible.

EDIT: https://gfycat.com/BowedHeartfeltAmericancrocodile

Bot couldn't post it.
Boxer being very boxer like.  I swear those dogs' energy levels could power a city.
OMG, this is making me so excited to get my boxer pup in November.
If any of you watch this and say "I need a dog like this in my life" Literally find any Boxer and adopt it, they are all spinny spazzes who turn into donuts when excited.
About as regal as can be expected by a boxer.
This is the most Boxer thing I’ve ever seen! My baby does stuff like this all the time 😭
This is why boxers are the best dogs. 

They will listen and execute perfectly..... only if they want to though.
Ah, boxers.  The nuts of the dog world.
Nailed it
r/technicallycorrect
God I love boxers. Mine is 11 and still plays with my other dogs like she is a puppy. Definitely not as agile as she once was and it's tough knowing she won't be here one day.
He did it perfect!! Jsut a bit of th ol' razzle dazzle first.
I could tell that was a boxer without even seeing its face.
This is the epitome of a boxer
This is why I love boxers.
So the doggie cyclone was great, but it's important not to miss when the dog's body took off so hard, it's head couldn't keep up and he gave himself whiplash
The juxtaposition of the referee's slow walk into her position to deeply analyze this dog, versus him simply not giving a single flying fuck about anything except becoming the world's best dog helicopter... it's too much.
The dog did sit, and he made sure to throw in a little extra flair for bonus points!
Pure Boxer, what did you expect?
Flawless
Boxers gonna boxer! I think they do this just because they like feeling the single marble in their heads swirl around.
He did dun up and sit in front of her,  he just did it with a little more PIZAZZ than expected
I DID IT I DID IT I DID IT! - dog probably
so my boxer is fine ...
Dog.exe is experiencing issues
r/whatswrongwithyourdog
it's almost a little sad they need to train that exuberance out of that pup
Added in camel spins for increased difficulty, 10/10
bonus dance
Fucking boxers man... Love em but dumb as hell
Extra style points
I think that’s a boxer. I don’t have much experience with them, but this seems about right, assuming it is a boxer.
Nailed it!
Give them the ol' razzle dazzle
Bonus point for the fancy dance moves
Soooo... bonus points for style, right?
Is it a boxer? It strikes me as a boxer thing to do
Peak Boxer!
360 No Sit, fuckin nailed it
Didn’t know dogs came with a spin cycle!!
Boxer in a nutshell.
I love the acceleration, head thrown back, white of the eyes seen, one paw almost galloping in the air.
11/10. great performance. you win the competition.
as far as i can tell this Boxer was set to pause and then fast forward.
Love boxer dogs, thanks for sharing!
#NAILED IT
Boxers man.
I have a boxer too, they are all a bit crazy!
You read the title, see the dog is a Boxer. Yep, this isn't going to go exactly to plan.
Of course it had to be a boxer.
Having done obedience, I would have loved to hear what the judge said to the owner at the end.
After judging robot obedience dogs all day, I am sure she enjoyed this dog's sheer joy on that recall. What a wonderful dog!
100/10
Can you give us a link with sound ... the *sauce*, if you will?

After all, I want to hear everybody bursting in laughter!
I love the boxer spins!
Boxers are special.
That was the most Boxer dance I have ever seen.
He did with style, now I’m impressed.
As someone who owns a boxer, this cannot be any more accurate if it tried to be!!!
Have to love Boxers. From cool and calm to berserk in .5 seconds.
I love Boxers!
Perfect execution of a very complex routine. I award the gold medal.
This reminds me of when someone sings the national anthem at the Superbowl and decides to do a long drawn out OOOO Ahhh OOOOOO mmmmm hmmmmmm rendition at the end.
Technically he did everything correct, but with some bonus moves added.
I been having a kind of shitty day so this made me laugh
He just added a little razzle dazzle.
Jiu jitsu! Parkour! I love you! Woof
Thats a boxer 100%
The way his head tilts backwards when he starts is killing me.
Cue the cartoon sounds !
This looks more like sabotage for making him do these competitions lol
Seriously too funny!!!! Made me laugh my ass off! Dog deserves gold all day long.
Nailed it
How do I find out who posted this here?  Not that I mind but I would like the credit for it. That is me and my dog at a show on Sunday
Technically he did
r/Zoomies
I’m gonna allow it
I laughed continuously for 20 seconds. Not only did he sit, he made me laugh. Upvote.
He just put a little spice on it
Lol boxers are so goofy
It’s not where you’re going, it’s how you got there
I just realized that this whole time society has been judging dog shows by the wrong metrics entirely
r/PetTheDamnDog
As a former obedience trainer and judge, I would be laughing so much! Not quite sure how to score that, but all of the points for creativity
In truth, that's pretty good for a Boxer.
Definition of boxer right here.
Is Boxer.

This is how they do everything you ask them to.

EVERYTHING!

They're the best doggos.

I miss my boys.
You know how much I love this class?! 

Let me show you through.... **interpretive dance**
It's not the destination, but the journey that matters.
Spectacular execution.
Imagine being that excited about *anything*
Police: walk in a straight line to me to see if you are drunk

Florida man:
Why I need a boxer in my life Reason #663,653,196...
The ol' razzle dazzle
Run and sit 

But make it fashion
I have seen enough videos of Boxers to know that this is the most calm and focussed you could ever expect.
I love boxers! Miss my buddy, he's a few states away :(

This is why we love them
He added his little twist on it. He did it though :D
I started laughing out loud in a quiet library hahah I love this dog
Boxers have a way of making you think they're dumb.
"hey, doggo, remember this thing I taught you?"

"YES I DO, OH BOY, OH BOY CAN I DO IT NOW? I KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO THIS IS SO FUN!"
Did a hekkin good job
Boxers > all other breeds
This is obviously the freestyle round
He eventually sat! Should get an award for being a free spirit, happy doggie!!
Give em the ole RAZZLE DAZZLE! 

15/10 Great dog, outstanding performance!
Boxers, man.
OH BOY I KNOW THIS ONE I KNOW THIS ONEIKNOWTHISONE
Style points 100
Boxers always seem to have their head catching up to their body when they run.
Nailed the dismount. I don’t see the problem here.
Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy! Oh Boy!
Float like a butterfly spin like a bee.
what did humans ever do to deserves such amazing companions
Boxers are part of the working group and their job is to play
How to do mundane tasks with a flair
The exuberant love for his mummy though!
I mean, she did the command, she just threw some freestyle in there!
Technically, doggo did everything that was required.
This made me laugh out loud and now everyone thinks I’m crazy 😂 this is gold
He did it with pizzazz
Um, it's called STYLE, Barbara. Look it up.
Well...he did sit...eventually.
That windup tho.
I mean....he did sit...(irl...what a good dog)
Mission failed successfully
Perfect. The dog did exactly what it was supposed to do.
Give 'em the ol' razzle dazzle!
Someday, we will invent the technology to record video in the same kind of horizontal aspect ratio we experience our lives in. Until then, I guess 30% ceiling/sky and 30% ground is just something we will have to get used to.
Seems like a perfectly normal boxer response to me. We used to breed them, and they are all big lovable derps.
Looks like typical boxer behavior. No dog loves life more than a boxer. That's why we're picking up our 11th boxer puppy this Sunday. Beyond excited.[Ernie](https://imgur.com/ABMzznq)
Pfft. Showoff.
I mean, technically he did it, he just did some spins in the middle lmao
She put a twist in that command.
This dog iz a little extra
Reminds me of my dog. In the early morning we walk carefully so as not to wake up my husband. She walks quietly to mimic me. I notice, I smile at her- her tail knocks over my coffee.
What you talking about he did exactly what he was told 😂🧡 damn I love dogs
Where can I get that fencing? Lol
I used to have a boxer (Jake) that I took to dog training.  One session we were working on sit and stay, all the other dogs did perfectly, little trot up to their owners, around their legs then a nice little sit.

Then came Jake's turn... The first warning sign was the whimpering when I started walking away.  The second warning sign was when he started tippy-tapping his front paws.  The third and final warning was a fully grown boxer dog sprinting full pelt across the room.

He jumped at full speed straight into my chest, sending me backwards into a wall head first.  Then he sat down.

Instructor panicked, class laughed, I had a headache and Jake looked very proud of himself.

We did not go back to dog training classes...
YOU KNOW WHAT

He did it. He fucking did it. But he did it HIS way. And I think that’s beautiful. 😊😊😊
OMGYOULEFTMEALLALONEANDNOWWEAREBACKTOGETHERAGAINANDYAY!oh, right...sit

Awh I love boxers and their cute little smooshed droopy faces!
I'm imagining the pooch sitting ready, first competition, slightly hyperventilating... "hwoo... hwoo... OK you got this... this is the big time, lots of humans watching... my time to shine... aaand HERE WE GO WOOOO!"

It's hilarious that the woman was probably embarrassed but in reality this shit is adorable and just natural.
I love boxers, they're so goofy
Love Boxers!!
Boxer owners will understand it...
I love boxers... they're the clowns of the dog world.
Dog use tornado!
He just did it with style.
BOXER ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Boxers are simply the best and that is pretty normal for one.
Boxers are the best.
I will upvote anything with a boxer in it as I'm an absolute sucker for them
The way how the dog rushed to his/her owner... it is like the body already moved but the head stayed behind and even jerked backward. A very fast runner indeed.
Full marks!!! 11/10
Hahaha!  When I was judging, these were the dogs I loved.
Anybody have the video? I need to hear the audience reaction to this.
That boi is an adorable ball of derp 😍

Omg this is a perfect score. No issues

Yup that's a boxer. 🤣
That is just a Boxer acting Boxery
As far as I am concerned he did what he was told just with a little personality.
I miss my boxer :). They have the most amazing personalities.
The cutest part of it is the way he gets up, that’s a big get up.
I mean he DID do those things just with a little extra ~flair~
Gotta add a little bit of finesse to impress the judges!
The rules didn’t state that the dog couldn’t look ‘fabulous’ doing the task.
11/10 good boy execution
Lol looks like my boxer 😂
+10 points for added flair.


This doge met the required criteria *and then some*.
I am smartest boi ever! Weeeeeeee! I'm so smart! I smart boi! 
Oh.
Just adding some creative flair
What a beautiful dog! All that personality cannot be contained.
give em the ole razzle dazzle
I am not going to "do" the "twirl," alright? It's not even a twirl, it's a spin....I might do the spin.
Style points level Boxer !!
That’s the type of thing that makes me really dislike those types of classes. If you laugh at your dog being so sweet, you get degrading in pints or whatever.
Boxers are so hyper when young, but when they get old they become super mellow and clingy
Its a boxer, my one acts like this
"I make this shit look good!"---Dog.
Razzle Dazzle!
This is why I absolutely love my boxer!
Boxers are the best dogs ever.
[deleted]
How is she not laughing hysterically?
I like his way better
I mean he did what he was supposed, just added a step or two.
Of course he's a boxer goofy boy !
Awww he did!! In the cutest way possible. Happy doggy!!
"hmmm.. I was supposed to do something... Is that mom? MOM I'M COMIN *pant pant pant* MOM! BHGHLEHGLHGLHGLHLBLGGOBBH- Hold up... There was something I was supposed to do... Oh yeah! Sits."
It's a boxer, this is accurate
Boxers are the best! And funniest, goofiest, lovebugs.
I love how his head almost gets left behind when he takes off
The spinning around he is doing is the next training step where he turns around then sits at heel on her left side. It looks like he just got overexcited in anticipation of a treat. In this exercise dog must come to her with a hand signal and sit directly in front of her with his nose immediately in front of her knees. It looks like he knows the commands, but just got overexcited.
Boxers are the absolute best.
Only Boxer can do it.❤️
Boxers gonna boxer
I've never see a dog do a burnout before.  Nice.
Boxers are the best breed of animal I swear.
I can only hope and pray to have even half the enthusiasm for life that this boxer has.
Perfect 10, doggy added his/her own personality to trick
Don't understand, he sat
His feet are faster than his face!
That is a perfectly well trained dog right there!
I can barely imagine a boxer doing anything other than exactly this. 🤣
Hahahah, I absolutely LOVE this!!  Who couldn’t adore that much excitement after 30 seconds of separation?!?
Fuckin boxers...
Lmao!!! Classic Boxer 😂😂
Run and sit. But make it FASHION
That’s a boxer for ya
The take off!
The physical definition of a boxer.
it's a boxer. what do you expect lmao
I love boxers
My dog is a boxer mix. This is pretty much exactly how it goes 😆
Well that's just how Boxers move. Nothing wrong here.
Boxer dog loolz
There is sitting, and there is sitting with style!
Awww love this. That's so Boxer, I was the mum of a boxer for 11 years and this one is 100% better trained than mine. Totally my fault but I loved her craziness.
I see no issues here
This is exactly why I loved my boxer growing up.
Boxer? Typical
I giv 10/10 good dogo
He didn’t run into owner, didn’t jump up on her, didn’t beg for pets, and sat perfectly. Honestly, what more could want? I would love if my dogs greeted everyone this politely.
Give em the old razzle dazzle
The beginning and end was flawless.  Threw in a little extra credit for style points.  Perfect 10!
Dog is like “running and sitting that’s wayyy to easy. let me do a couple of flips or something geez”
He's just freestyling dude
You have to allow a brother to have his own style
Well he obviously gets the concept but is just very excited about it!
Flawless execution.
Sitting with style
And he did a good job too!
#Nailed It
A+
Just added his own personal razzle dazzle to it! I see no problem. 15/10. His execution was flawless. Bonus points for added flair.
What a dope ass dog
I don't see a problem here
HAHAHAAHA what a legend of a dog, you know he knew that  it was someone recording and decided to fck shitt up hahahaahhaha. Good dog.
This dog's playing 3D chess while all the others ... checkers
Just added some spice for the judges. I can only assume they were given perfect 10's across the board.
Boxers are the biz
Minor issue in the sitting() procedure... Will be fixed in the next release! :)
Runtime works fine so far. Bit crazy but acceptable!

As a workaround the woman should turn around the dog very fast. So it will look like the dog is working properly!
Sorry what's the problem again?
He’s a beyblade
It did
That’s called *pizzazz*!
I prefer his method better
He was just keeping it 100
That was no ordinary attempt to catch his tail. It looked more impressive than the come and sit!
Oh my gawd his is so sweet! "Mom! Mom! Look at me! I'm doing it! did you see! Just for you!" 14/10 good boi.
Style points
Even if it lost, that dogs a winner in my book.
boxers are awesome
That’s extra credit for the good boi
Fricken boxers man.
Mission Accomplished.
Boxers are probably the purest expression of a loveable idiot in the dog world. Goddamn they are loveable, but sweet Jesus they are gigantic idiots.

I love them so much.
That's a boxer; that totally counts as a "sit" for a boxer.
Perfect!
"Why are you booing me, im right"
That's exactly what he did. Job done. Good doggo.
What a good boi
Almost got whiplash from all the torque he was pullin' at the start

Hey he got there.
and that’s a winner right there
Boxer- and now i run to hooman! I add a little razzle dazzle at the end, and hwala. I a sit.
This is why as soon as I have time to care for one properly I'm getting a boxer.
I mean he technically did the trick. Just in a bit of a round about way.
He had like 14 seconds of stored up energy to burn before he could sit still again.
Ah, the old boxer kidney bean dance.  Best dogs ever.
Haha ya I got one of dem.  Boxers do what they want man always a puppy
Yep. Looks like a pro Boxer dog. Would love 1000%.
Well technically, he did do it.
Of course it's a /r/Boxer
Boxers are such goofballs! I love them all so much!
I’m sure it’s been tagged, but definitely r/zoomies worthy
That's on par for a boxer to get a touchdown for the first doubly play dunk.
He did exactly what he was supposed to. He can let his personality show all he wants.
This is the 12th time I’ve watched this today. I just can’t get over how funny this is. He’s trying so hard lol.
Mission accomplished
A leaf on the wind
boxers are awesome.
Such a perfect boxer.
Well points for style :-)

This is why I love boxers so much. Such loveable goofballs 😂
For the first time In this sub I actually LOUDLY said awww to this video. 
Normally it’s an internal tiny awww.
I should go to more dog shows
I feel like when that lady looks over and sees the dog flipping around she’s trying so hard not to laugh so the dog will eventually end up sitting lol
What a good boi.  He did what he was told to do... with style.
Flawless execution
If you have ever owned a boxer you understand every reason the dogs like this, if you haven’t you’re missing out
Oh man this is why I love boxers and have two.
I mean, the dog did do what was asked. Just with a little extra style.
typical boxer
Nailed it?
Laughed too hard 👌🤭🙏🙌
Omg it's like a real life cartoon. Scooby dooby doooooo ! I can hear all the sound effects.

She did a wonderful job I dont see the problem

Give that doggo a big ass treat
He did it!!! Good pup
Nailed it! 10/10 perfect score.
“I’m going to do the spin”-Micheal
Our boxer is affectionately called “the idiot” this is why.
He had the best of intentions, “I’m gonna win this for mommy” *jumps around, jumps up jumps up and gets down*
Spin THEN Sit. Ok got it.😂
This is why we love boxers.
He better have won
Guess she passed the test!
A true boxer in all of its kidney-beaning glory!
Well he did it eventually
Always that one girl who is so extra!
10/10
Nailed it!
The dog did it with flair 😂😂
My sides hurt after watching this a dozen times 🤣🤣
He did do it with extra pizazz
Mission failed successfully
Boxers are the most Derp breed i ever met
Boxers, the comedians of the dog world.
#well that just looks like sitting with extra steps
Boxers were bred from extinct bullenbaiser breeds crossed with mastiff, bulldog and possibly Great Dane, even a terrier. But they also crossbred with springs as evidenced by this pooch
I know it’s unrelated, but I love your username. I don’t know if “pronk” means anything but it’s still hilarious
Can confirm it's a boxer. I know that happy dance anywhere.
That's a pass right?
This is how kids work, he's just a puppy still.
Damn I just realized I would love a sub full of funny dog school videos.
Boxers... haha
I love when dogs do that little wheelie/burnout when they take off like that. I could watch it all day. We need r/doggoburnouts r/doggowheelies
When someone asks for a simple beat, but you want to add your style to it.
That's the GOOBEST boi! 💙 💙 💙 So gooby!
Aawww damn thanks for the laugh, I nearly pissed myself. Best laugh I've had all week.
I like what he did better than what he’s supposed to do
Perfect form, flawless execution quadruple spin and down. Marvellous.
Spin cycle!
He did it just fine. Achieved the objective and added *panache*.
Give em’ the old, Razzle Dazzle....
It's not his fault, Sit was still on cooldown
I have not seen a more perfect Boxer sit. Well done!
As a momma to 2 boxers this is an average Tuesday lol. They are the goofiest best dogs ever. And if my dog added in those extra zoomies but then still sat she’d be getting so many treats lol
Wacky inflatable arm flailing tube man wacky inflatable arm flailing tube man
God, boxers are everything. They all have the same rambunctious attitude
I wonder if she walks further away in practice and the dog is making up the difference.
The head back like “oh here we go! My human wants me!!!” Is such a boxer thing. I wish this video had sound. Boxers are the biggest goofballs of all.
Yesss. Gotta love a boxer.
I’ve got 2 boxers. 4yrs and 9mos. This is there very reaction every time I get home from work
Boxers are the best!
Boxers are awesome
Thats some funny boxer shit.
10/10 for flair
this dog has too much life in it. You are awarded no points and are disqualified from the dog show competition
Technically he followed the order.

The best kind of followed.
A dog's version of "Jazz Hands!"
Yup that's a boxer
#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/socialpronk!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
Well, he got there eventually, didn’t he?
Fuckin boxers man lol
He’s a true showman!
But he did! And with such enthusiasm.
WOMAN: Dog, you have to run up and sit in front of me.

&#x200B;

DOGGO: FUCK YOU! I'll to do it because I HAVE to, but I will do it my way!!!
all that showboating
That dog accelerated so hard he almost snapped his neck
That’s gotta be bonus points right?
To be fair he did sit down after
Such an adorable dog.
I have a Boxer and she does this exact same thing with me. It's hilarious
I love how he’s so goofy! Like a cartoon he runs  too fast for his head that stays behind lmao
Think I caught an aneurysm watching that!
Style points
Boxers are the greatest derpers ever to derp.
Today on: a list of reasons why I love boxers ❤️
🤣
Fucking gold medal for him.
Perfect execution
Mental lag 100
OKIE DOKIE!

***everything*** in life should be done with this kind of joie de vivre
Love it
I like to think he/she is making the zoidberg "WOOP WOOP WOOP" sound during this thing.
WAIT WHAT??? THATS LITERALLY THE FACILITY WHERE MY LAB HAD HER TRAINING LOL
Wonderful! He loves his owner so much.. what a gorgeous dog
He's not wrong
Dog: Ok gotta focus

\*Person calls\*

Dog: asdlkhfalkejncoeij
And STUCK the landing.
And he did!  I don't see the problem 😍
Aww
As a lifelong Boxer owner, that was more than anyone could ever expect from the breed. The most hard headed creatures I’ve ever encountered and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
As a life long boxer owner, owner of multiple boxers, this is to be expected and we wouldn’t have it any other way. 

Boxers are the most loving, cute, adorable, sweet breed there is. But one thing they are not, is obedient. They just want to play. 

I’ve literally never seen an obedient boxer, mine or anybody else’s. 

But they are the sweetest dogs there are.

This pupper needs to be in musical canine freestyle
100000000009% boxer!!!
Well, give doggo treato!!!
Normal bois sit. Good bois do a 1980 sit.
Still a gooddest boi.
I really with I was there to witness this in person. Also, this cuteness belongs on r/animalsbeingderps and r/whatswrongwithyourdog
My favorite boxer description: Floats like a butterfly, runs like a psychopath.
My Pitbull did similar in her training. She was so ecstatic to go to school.
Is everybody watching?

Okay let's do this Leeeerrrrooooooyyyyyyy
Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jen Jenkiiiiinnnnnnss!

And nailed the landing.

Sup Linda where's my treat?
Boxers: warming our hearts and souls since 1831
Having a boxer I 100% feel this video, they know exactly what to do just they do it their way. One trick to calm them down... Lightly scratch the top of their head, they make a face like a turtle shitting, yawn and lay down.
r/tippytaps
Being a 4x boxer owner, I can tell you that particular dog chews the hell out of couches.
He wasnt done running yet that's all, 10/10 good boi
10/10
Good boi was well excited on the day... that launch tho  😊  😊  😊
When you realize  halfway through that something is going really, really well.
So funny.  What a spaz!
Extra points for style!!
This made my morning! Thank OP
# POINTS!
The should NOT take points off for exuberance!
He a funny good boi
Run: check

Sit: check

I don't see anything wrong. Good boy.
Show off.
Engage ludicrous speed!
This needs sound lol
A+ with all the extra credit. Good boi.
He wanted to do a happy dance first.
There was an attempt.
He listened, he just has SO MUCH energy
I want one!
It got the zoomies. That's not fair. Zoomies are like sneezing. Can't punish for something like that.
In golf, they say the game isn’t about how you make the number on the scorecard, all pars count the same.
Yep. That dog gets a pass from me.
Technical A+!
"YOU DONT RUN MY LIFE!"
**BAY BLADE BAY BLADE LET IT RIP**
Pup has some pep in her step.
flawless excution
Perfect score: 5/7. Would get lots of belly rubs.
r/zoomies
Sometimes you can’t control the zoomies, the zoomies control you
This gives me so much joy. 😂😂🤦🏻‍♀️❤️
We don't deserve dogs.
Do a barrel... Barrel.. barrel.. barrel roll!!!
Boxers are born with long tails.
1st place
Sitting here rehab after dbl tkr and this made my day! Wish I still had my puppers here
In that case, a flawless performance.
Perfect 10/10
"I'll sit but not until I do this. Weeeee. Okay, I sit"
Made it farther than my dog would’ve
Boxers are the derps of the dog world.
I don't see the problem.
I think my boxer is broke I never see him do zoomies and cute stuff like this.
The goodest boye
That counts! That still counts!
And he done so much more and imo better!!
[Obligatory Michael Scott](https://youtu.be/ffBM_DsC2X8?t=23)
Love the enthusiasm
R/zoomies
Awww
This is the human equivalent of people who sing the national anthem and put a little extra on it.
Style points.
Well, given the link address... that *does* look like a "Bewitched Pleased Bongo"...

Extra points for being a goof
10/10
He loves her, yeah, yeah, yeah
Everyone talking about the zoomies, and nobody mentioning the way the traction control kicked in at the beginning and he just TOOK OFF. 

I could watch that all day long.
So does he get extra points for derping the fuck out or what?
r/zoomies
Obedience with Flair™
Mission accomplished
Ah, another excellent addition to my collection of dogs lurching forward as if suddenly pulled by an invisible rope coming out of their chest.
I see this as an absolute win
He knows theres style points
It's cute how he looks at the crowd. I can almost hear him thinking "Oooh, we got an audience? I better jazz this up a little".
Look what I can do!
How did she not laugh her ass off?
And so he did.
Extra points for style
Gotta convert all of that linear momentum into angular momentum
