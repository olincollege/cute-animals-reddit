"I think it's yours" .
Apropo, they have a YouTube channel. The Human is really great, funny and knows what she's doing. Iirc, she's an ornithologist. Also she's got a cat named Murloc and a _Giant Owl_ who goes by the name Yoll'

Seeing a owl blink like that gave me goosebumps
That owl is buggin.
I didn't expect the feather like that ü§£
My parrot is terrified of his own feathers once they fall off, kinda what i was expecting to see. Like this better

"Is this yours?" "It seems to me that this is yours"
"Excuse me sir! I do believe you've dropped your feather! :)"

"Doesnt look familiar to me"

"What? I just saw it fall off of you. Here."

"Nope, it's not mine"

"Its yours. I'm trying to be a good person and return it to you"

"Return what to who?"

"Arent you a *[insert owl species]*?"

"Yup!"

"And the banding on this feather matches your plumage, as confirmed by various field guides?"

"Yup!"

"And I found this feather ten feet away from you, the only *[insert owl species]* within a 15 mile radius. Which means, this must be *your feather."*

"Makes sense to me."

"So take it."

"It's not my feather."
The owl is like WTF???
I could hear that warning sound from *Solid Snake* when an enemy spots you when the video taker stuck the feather into the owl's head.
That thing looks terrified
i do this to my cats whenever they have a whisker that falls out! lil unicorns, it kills me every time

Never knew how bad I wanted an owl until now...
I can't believe you can get pet owls.
The owl has seen some shit in its life
Sorry, but owls are NOT pets. These videos only help to sponsor and propagate the illegal wildlife trade.
This is cute, but don't keep owls as pets, they want to be OUTDOORS.
Poor owl. Living in the kitchen instead of outside where it belongs.
