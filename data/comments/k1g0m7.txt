"I think it's yours" .
Apropo, they have a YouTube channel. The Human is really great, funny and knows what she's doing. Iirc, she's an ornithologist. Also she's got a cat named Murloc and a _Giant Owl_ who goes by the name Yoll'

Seeing a owl blink like that gave me goosebumps
That owl is buggin.
I didn't expect the feather like that 🤣
My parrot is terrified of his own feathers once they fall off, kinda what i was expecting to see. Like this better

"Try riding a bicycle at night and picking up a moving burrito with your feet based on the sound that it makes."
He looks like a magic owl who is SHOCKED the human can see him.
Great. Now i want an owl

That boop sound effect did it for me.
Owls are just flying cats
It's so tiny!

I want to fucking squish that thing until it explodes, with love

"Is this yours?" "It seems to me that this is yours"
"Excuse me sir! I do believe you've dropped your feather! :)"

"Doesnt look familiar to me"

"What? I just saw it fall off of you. Here."

"Nope, it's not mine"

"Its yours. I'm trying to be a good person and return it to you"

"Return what to who?"

"Arent you a *[insert owl species]*?"

"Yup!"

"And the banding on this feather matches your plumage, as confirmed by various field guides?"

"Yup!"

"And I found this feather ten feet away from you, the only *[insert owl species]* within a 15 mile radius. Which means, this must be *your feather."*

"Makes sense to me."

"So take it."

"It's not my feather."
The owl is like WTF???
I could hear that warning sound from *Solid Snake* when an enemy spots you when the video taker stuck the feather into the owl's head.
That thing looks terrified
i do this to my cats whenever they have a whisker that falls out! lil unicorns, it kills me every time

Man, I’m so tired. This video started auto playing as I scrolled past and I could have sworn I saw Groot doing the Saturday Night Fever dance.
Owl closing its eyes at the end like "\**sigh*\* Look, Marise. We discussed this..."
An owl is not a pet.
Why does he look so scared but become so happy by barely changing anything?
I thought that was half a torso sticking out of a table in the thumbnail
Aaaaaaahwwwwww❤️❤️ I want to give so much love to this sweetie
Isn't it like dangerous to keep an owl as a pet
He looks so happy to see his friend again!
Can anyone translate what she said please? That owl is so darn cute omg!

How can you get a owl as a pet?
Never knew how bad I wanted an owl until now...
I can't believe you can get pet owls.
The owl has seen some shit in its life
Sorry, but owls are NOT pets. These videos only help to sponsor and propagate the illegal wildlife trade.
This is cute, but don't keep owls as pets, they want to be OUTDOORS.
Poor owl. Living in the kitchen instead of outside where it belongs.

He is now sitting bull.
owls are kind of wildlife that suffers greatly in captivity, almost all of them develop psychological and physical problems..never an aww moment for me when i see things this
How fucking cruel is it to keep a wild animal as a pet, those people are like shit on shoes
Dunno if it’s just me but owls look high all the time

Hilarious. That bird looks clueless and simultaneously hyper aware.
Is it weird that I love owls :D

From owl to native american in less then .2 seconds
What kinda POS has an owl as a pet
So cute and everything, but let's not forget that is a wild animal and it should be flying freely. Don't buy exotic animals. No demands no business
Lol I didn’t notice it was an owl on wood and I thought it was a wood statue of some guy with his hand on the wall jerkin it
I have to get an owl now
🦉 I'm Hiawatha. Woo woo woo woo...  

👱‍♀️ Okay, first off, racist. Second...
There is no way in hell that bird smiles and winks with its eyes like that with little devil horns for ears...nothing that adorable is allowed to exsist. Are you sure this isnt shooped?
