That man just saved that sloth 3 hours. Fucking legend.
Thank......................................................................................................you.
Just traveled the speed of light onto a tree.
So cute. I kinda got the impression that he was fully aware of what just transpired and was truly grateful.
Wow it looks like he actually thanked that guy
Was that a wave at the end?
Hey...Priscilla...what...do...you call...a three...humped...camel?
I don‚Äôt understand how sloths haven‚Äôt become extinct.
I love that he didn't just move it away from the car danger her moved it to where it would be safest.
Sloth to his buddies: Dude I was cruising right! Then whoa shit I just flew man like light speed and smashed into a tree. I have no idea how I didn‚Äôt die!
‚ÄúWe are never hasty.  Anything worth saying is worth taking your time.    Thank.... you.... hoooooman.‚Äù
Hope he washed his hands, legendary bacteria on that lil guy
Imagine you‚Äôre just walking down the street and then the sun god just reaches out and warps you into the year 2050.

That is basically what just happened to the Sloth.
He's probably late for work at the DMV
The guy is bamboozled. He never moved so fast in his life
I‚Äôve seen this before but honestly it never gets old and I‚Äôll watch it and upvote it every time. All the feels!
That‚Äôs literally like a giant eagle picking up Frodo in the Shire and flying him all the way to Mount Doom. Saved him from an excessively long, dangerous journey.
Where‚Äôs the one with the R Kelly song?  

Wait here it is:
 https://youtu.be/ba7rRfKIHxU
Heeeeeeeyyyyyyyy....... maaaaannnnnn.... sloowww....... theeeeeeeee....... fuckkkkkkkkkk......... doooooowwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!
Translation of some lines because i‚Äôm too lazy to translate them all

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs very docile‚Äù

‚ÄúPut her on the tree‚Äù

‚ÄúLook what a cutie, my god‚Äù 

‚ÄúLook what a beautiful one‚Äù

‚ÄúLook how cool man‚Äù

‚ÄúShe thanks‚Äù

I love that he walked the little guy all the way to the tree and didn‚Äôt just dump him on the ground away from the traffic.

Faith in humanity: +1
Sloth says thanks
There's so much beauty and love in this video is incredible. This brought a smile and a tear to my face.
Fun fact: a sloth's claws are actually their fingerbones protruding from their flesh.
This makes me wonder if other animals experience time at a different speed than we do. Does that sloth view our movements the same way we view a squirrel's? And do squirrels think we move slowly like we think sloths do?
slo mo thanks
Everyone liked that.
O Brasil que deu certo!
i love how they even blink slowly lol
Does the sloth knows that he's very slow or does everyone moves very fast from his point of view ?
One of my favourite sloth facts is when conservationists are tracking a sloth, they don‚Äôt waste time tagging them to track them. They can simply return to the last known location of the sloth and within 30 minutes, find them.
fun fact about sloths: sometimes they think their arm is a branch, they grab their arm with their other claw, which then causes them to fall down and die.
Sloth wanted to take a pee

So he went down down the tree

It was starting to smell funny

So he wanted a change of scenery 

Crossing the road got really scary

But he got picked up by a deary 

And up up in a new tree he was finally happy
To his other sloth brethren: ‚Äú I               think            I        may  have           teleported            today!‚Äù
Is their slowness some kind of camouflage?
I...was...just..about..to...turn..around.   I...forgot...my...keys!!
I feel like sloths and Ents are homies.
Dude, wtf I just came from this side
Never moved so fast in his life. Like being on a roller coaster ‚ÄúThis is okay....AAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH....that was fun!‚Äù
[deleted]
There is someone on reddit who, whenever there is a post about sloths, goes one a rant about how horrible they are as a species. I'm surprised I haven't seen them on this post yet.
Guy waves and walks away. the sloth goes to wave back, gets halfway there, but the guys gone, so hes just like, "thank.........oh......right....then........" and goes back to climbing.
Further than he was planning to go all day
Sloths seem so animatronic lol.
Apes alone weak. Apes together strong.
So sweet
Jesus H. Slow the F down human!!
That sloth is all like "Woah, slow down. What's the hurry?"
That sloth was like ‚Äúlight speed to Endor!‚Äù as he was being carried across the street
The sloth was actually trying to defend itself and claw the shit out of the guy for putting his hands on it. But the reaction time is as you can see. 

/s obviously
No one has posted this yet? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7rRfKIHxU
‚ÄúWHY WE GOIN SO FAST‚Äù
‚ÄúSLOW DOWN!!!! Scared the shit out of me... sheesh.‚Äù
How long do you think you'd be left unread by this sloth? How long until he replies? Girl get you a sloth that treat you better. Little does she know he is a great sloth. She just didn't have the patience.
What if that sloth was crossing the other way and that man put him back were he started ? LOL
Awwww it waved!!
[deleted]
Flash flash hundred yards dash
I am still so confused on how the sloth has not gone extinct.
Dude I full expecting that sloth to give a thumbs up at the end.
That guy just saved me a week....
Somewhere I hear Kristen Bell losing her shit
Still probably gets out of bed faster than I do...
Dang I felt like I was watching Zootopia
That little dude now knows what it's like to be the Flash.
Even it's wave of thanks is sssslllloooooooow.
Thanks human, you saved me a 2-3 day trip
Sloth be like "Holy crap I've never gone so fast in my entire life"
Literally cut two years off its journey.
Bro i just got blessed by the forest sprit
Dude probably thinks he just flew at the speed of light.
Sloths Gotta Love Em
That‚Äôs basically like time travel to him
Sloth: thanks for the lift. Pound it bro awe too slow
He was like *Thhhaaaaannnkkkkkssss*
It took him 5 minutes to wave lol
How in the world did these creatures survive for this long?
Why the fuck do they move so slowwwwwwww?????
That just cut his day in half
That‚Äôs how you film these things! Kudos to the cameraman
Fun fact. Sloths can/and often defecate for over one-third their body weight. That is like if a human made a poop as big as both their legs. NATURE!!!
He's just pissed because that's the side of the street he came from and it took him 2 weeks to get over there
You can see appreciation and gratitude on its face
"Mf let me hang up with my fist bump... Im outta here"
Just gonna leave Sloth hanging on that brofist?
It looked like he waved a thank you to the man.  How cool are those people.  The best.
Sloth be like dudee this isn‚Äôt my tree
Sloth just had a reverse birthday
The claws don‚Äôt seem to match their style. Leftover gene from an ancestor or do those claws come in handy?
The ultimate ‚Äúwait for it‚Äù!
They even blink slowly
Cutie :) I feel like the sloth might have been trying to say "Thanks- same time tomorrow? I'll need to visit the tree on the other side of road tomorrow afternoon."
This is how I carry my kids when they poop their pants
I thought sloths were meant to be pretty fierce (but slow). Didn't really try to defend itself.
Fuck yea sloths.
Haha, this is in Brazil
No wonder why the DMV is still closed
I‚Äôm dead
.........................................

(gets placed on tree)

...........wheeeeeee!..........
That‚Äôs like taking the subway crosstown, thanks
It‚Äôs still soo amusing how slow sloths are
At the end was what a sloth calls the three toed salute. He actually wanted to go to the other tree.
Sloths ü¶• are so underrated
What a decent , thoughtful man. You know the sloth is saying "w a i t, c o m e   b a c k !" lol
Some say he's still climbing that tree
Hope in humanity üíñ
That sloth must have felt like it was going through G force with how fast he was moving. It would have taken him days/weeks to get to that tree by himself. Must have a great story to tell the other sloths now
Wow they really do be moving slowth
He reached out for a fist bump, but they left him hanging.
I really love sloths.
Awwwww, like he's reaching out for a fist bump! So cute... Good Hooman!
TIL sloths smile and show gratitude.
Sloths aren‚Äôt my thing but man was that adorable AF!
‚ÄúHey.... I lived on the other side...‚Äù
Ummm... It's a fucking miracle that evolution allowed them to survive or is it ironic
Aussie doing great Aussie things.....jus another day mate.
If he had thumbs he would've given a thumbs up at the end there lol
Unreal Engine 5 is pretty snatch.
‚ÄúThumbs up bro!‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, I have no thumbs...‚Äù
That look at the end is where I would pick the little guy back up and take him home!
That sloth: "Waaaaarp Zoooooooone!!!!"
That speed probably felt like galaxy timewarp for him
Flying is sooooo much faster than road travel.
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúduuuude. You just saved me 4 hours of walking. Thanks bruh‚Äù
He's like "tree!" When he sees the tree.
Amazed these things aren‚Äôt extinct
Like a rocket strapped to its back......
Sloth: Aaaaaahhhh slow it down....
This is crazy fast!
This animal is my soulmate
‚ÄúYooooooooo, thannnkkkkkasss brooooooo....‚Äù
I'm not crying...



Okay I am. That was so touching.
Haha they really are slow motion, that's hilarious, remindes me of zootopia
Episode 4: a sloth goes time travelling.
Wow, they even blink slowly.
Could you imagine how the sloth pereived this? To him he just broke the sound barrier
Man, how are those things not extinct? Do they not have any natural predators?
Anyone know what kind of animal this is?
Very slowly gives em the middle finger before climbing up the tree
"But that's where I came from."
Sloth - "holy shit holy shit, not so fast, not so fast dude, I am have a freaking heart attack! I would have got to the trees myself by sun down, fuck!"
Fun fact about sloths.  Sloths are actually very agile, though they always hang down like that as if they don't want to do anything. But once they get into the mood to move, sloths are amazing. Their fastest confirmed moving speed is over 100km/h."
I BELIEVE I CAN FLY
Looks like the sloth is saying, "thank you"
I legit wonder how the fuck slothes are still around being that slow
Thank you so much for this.


It's so wonderful to be reminded about how special our world really is. Some of the good stuff.
Do y‚Äôall ever just take a moment and think ‚Äòwait this is actually an animal that exists‚Äô lmao.
We don‚Äôt deserve sloths
Sloths supposedly move on the ground at a max speed of 3m per minute. That was about 15m I'd say, so might've only taken 5-7mins surprisingly.
Yo WHY WE GOING SO FRICKIN FAST
Awahaaaww
Pre-hired to work at the DMV
That‚Äôs probably the fastest he‚Äôs ever gone.  Like a dragster.
What if he was going the other way? Done fucked up his plans smh
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7rRfKIHxU

My favorite sloth vid
That‚Äôs me sayin goodbye to the homies after a couple of dabs
He said "thanks homie, good looking out"
He has never seen those speeds before.
Flash
#LUDICROUS SPEED GO!!!!
LMFAO. They even blink slow.
Priceless!  We all show our true feeling at some point!
[slothwave](https://youtu.be/VndW2DWhFaI)
That‚Äôs wonderful
Somewhere Kristen Bell is crying right now.
Kristen Bell would've just died on the spot ü§£
The sloth knew exactly what it was doing üòÇ
Welcome.........to.........the............DMV
*Gets picked up* 
‚ÄúWow I‚Äôve never moved this fast in my life!!‚Äù
Best human, helping not hurting‚ù§Ô∏è
The slow wave. Respect on both ends.
I want to believe this is 2020
‚ÄúArrrrrrrrrre yoooooooooouuu aaaaaaaaa wiiiiiiizzzzzzzzaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrd???‚Äù
Lol he‚Äôs like ‚Äúthanks bro‚Äù but really slowly
Gotta love the slow wave, thanks for the lift!
Sloths are so damn cute ;0; he was just like thank you giants for saving me from the big fast moving boxes
He believes he was saved by the Flash!
Sloths are neat.
Just gunna leave him hangin huh?
He was obviously reaching out for a fist bump dude.
He just got that joke from 10 minutes ago
That's almost 7 days of work done!
[clip](https://youtu.be/-2J9gyHXQbE)
I like how he turns and moves his arm like he waved goodbye
That sloth is going at fucking lightspeed compared to his normal pace... YOU WANNA SEE SOME REAL SPEED BITCH!
‚ÄúHa.................... ha................. ha‚Äù
"Well, there go my plans for the day"
They even blink slowly.
Phish
I thought he was going for a thumbs up
I now understand why Kristen Bell cries over sloths. That face! üò≠üòç
this makes me so happy :)
there will always be good people
They shit through their skin............, I was told. One morning our First Sergeant picked one up that had wondered into our p.t. area. I remember someone whispering it.
‚ÄúYou even put me in the tree!!‚Äù
‚Äú     Bye   !         I             Love            You     ‚Äú - sloth
The face of an animal that‚Äôs just had it‚Äôs first rollercoaster ride!
Zootopia came to mind when I saw the sloths face at the end! This made my day. I love ü¶•
I BELIEVE I CAN FLY
My Spirit Animal.
Sloth: "...............Hey.................That ..... was ......  really ....... cool ...... of ....... you ....... Thanks................. Bye ......."
In all seriousness, how has this animal survived?  I mean, doesn't it have any predators?  It's clearly not very difficult to catch and surely some rainforest cat finds them easy prey.  It's just odd that natural selection would leave an animal so vulnerable.
I wonder if sloths are like cats, when they blink slow it means they love you? I think that sloth just told that guy he loves him.
Human picks up  sloth 
Sloth *i believe I can fly.. I believe  I can touch the Sky *
MIYUBI
I bet the slough was thinking "welp this is how I die. Wait I'm not dead and I have a 45 minute head start up this tree.‚Äú
OMG how do they even survive predators as slow as they are
Pretty sure the guy that did this just got his ticket to Heaven punched.
Fuzzy went in for the fist buuuuump but got denied!
They even blink slow üòØ
You know that scene where quicksilver grabs magnito's head and then speeds him past the guards... yea
Please can someone edit him giving a thumbs up at the end
Take.............................


.........
....
.......


....care.
Sloth was in shock. He has never seen such speed.
He‚Äôs like ‚Äú holy crap I just went the speed of light‚Äù
Sloth: SLOW DOWN I WANNA GET THERE BUT I WANNA GET THERE ALIVE
It said :"Thanks man"
I like how it slowly waves back as a thank you
Are they really slow!!! I thought zootopia just made it for fun
 what makes sloths move so slow like that? any animal people know?
I really don't understand how these creatures survive
Seriously, how do these creatures survive being so slow???
He literally turned around to say thank you, don‚Äôt even try to convince me otherwise
Real sloths look like animatronic sloths. Its unreal how unreal they look.
how are these animals not extinct...?
That probably saved him two hours of work, little booger looked happy and waved a 1 FPS slow motion speed.
Hope he washed his hands after, a sloth's coat is a living carpet of algae and insect life.
I feel like humans are Cedar Point roller coasters to sloths.  ‚ÄúDude, did you ride the Miguel?‚Äù  ‚ÄúYes!!!  It was epic!!!  I laid in the street like you said, and then next thing I knew, I was going so fast my moss nearly blew off!  Gnarly!‚Äù
Voice 1: "Guys, she is so docile...

I saw a critter and said: 'Guys, what is that?'"

&#x200B;

Voice 2 (very silent): "Where do I put it?"

&#x200B;

Voice 1: "Put it on the tree! Put it on the tree!"

...

"She is so docile. But if someone hadn't see it... I was afraid... (The rest is muffled)"

&#x200B;

Voice 3 (probably the cameraman): (I'm not very certain on what he said, but it sounds like "maneirinho" which would mean something along the lines of "very cool")

&#x200B;

Voice 2: "Thanks, bye!"

&#x200B;

Voice 1: "Thanks, bye...

It's so cute! Oh my God!

She is so beautiful!"

&#x200B;

Voice 3: "Yeah...

Look at her thanking us!"

&#x200B;

Voice 1: "She is so cute... Look! Aww!"

&#x200B;

Voice 4(?): "Wow... That's so cool!"

&#x200B;

Voice 3: "Did you see? She thanked us!"

&#x200B;

Voice 1: "She is nice, see?"

&#x200B;

Voice 3: "Cool..."
He is so human with that smile
Everyone‚Äôs comments on him being super slow 
Me to myself ‚Äú damn that sloths faster then I am in the morning ... wish someone would pick me up and take me to where I need to be ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ‚Äù
Sloths will forever creep me out.
So zootopia didn't exaggerate!!! üòÇ
*Wrong tree, bitch*
That animal has such a moood
I love sloths so much there was one in my garden and he was the cutest boy ever.
God bless that man
This does put a smile on my face
Thought that sloth was gonna give them a thumbs up there lol
 Clearly staged. The sloth was a paid actor
‚ÄúWheeeeeeeeee immmmm flyyyiiinngggggg‚Äù
Hey man I‚Äôm not really feeling these edibles at all? Do I look high?
That sloth looks like a four-legged spider. I need 7.
thanks
I‚Äôm flying!
‚ÄúJack... I‚Äôm flying!‚Äù
He thinks he time travelled
Man i LOVE people like this, If I had a million $$$ I would go and find every one of these people and reward them for their kindness
What does science have to say about why they are so damn slow?
But what if he didn‚Äôt want to go on tree? Now it will take him hours to get down üòÇ
Damn I‚Äôve never seen a post so many times
I can‚Äôt imagine the level of stress that guy felt. Probably thought he was gonna get eaten
He is like, legit smiling!
He moves like he's in slow motion.
I want one!
Lit af
Is this language Italian?
Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash!
Those slow blinks
it that where he wanted to go?
Honestly thought that guy was gonna turn around and have the biggest smile on his face from relocating this sloth
It is trying to do a brofist with the camera man but apparently he is too slow for it.
Good job guys.
sloths creep me right TF out
Brazilian fauna ü•∞
I, again, have a small amount of faith in humanity.
Makes me have hope for the world
Finally... we found the perfect companion for Orange Cassidy!
Just stopped by to say I fucking love sloths.
I love how the human walked him all the way to the nearest tree
As evolution ebbs and flows I think sloths will take our place when we become extinct. They'll find remnants of our civilization and come up with theories about us. We'll be the aliens.
That‚Äôs my spirit animal I swear
Looks like me after too many edibles
Fun fact : sloths have a really hard time supporting their own body weight since their limbs are so weak, so they have a very strong grip to compensate for that, that's why placing it on a tree from which it can hang (which is preferable for any sloth) saved it so much trouble and pain it would have had to go through. That man did the right thing.
Thanks pimp
I still don't trust the speed they move at, there claws it's like I'm expecting them to be fast af any second
"Time traveling wizards..." - the sloth, definitely.
Slow wave...
Thought it was gonna do a thumbs up
3 toed sloth. Nice job dude.
Do they eat thc for every meal
"that's dope dude"
https://imgur.com/AnmSjbW
Flah Flash 100 yard Dash!
So wholesome!!! üòç
He clearly waved his hand.
Awww
I'm not Dr. Dolittle, but that looked like a thank you smile and wave.
I wonder how creatures like this survived the battle of evolution.
"thank.......... you............ brother........... üòå........"
Just gave him whiplash.
He said gracias in sign language really slowly.
Saved that man a 12 day journey. I think ill call those Amish cats from now on.
"Carl! Carl! Are you seeing this shit?! I got fucking super powers man!!"
Eliot. . .
Why are they so slow anyways?
Dude, slow down! Sloth could get whiplash.
Deadass thought he was gonna flip the guy off at the end
He even blinks in slow-mo!
he traveled one light year.
Oh
Thanks bro!
They're like loong ewoks....or vice versa.
I want to see a sloth on acid.
I think.
As the guy is carrying him to the othet side, the sloth experienced speeds he has never experienced before. Wonder if it was almost like a rollercoaster ride for it. "Weeeeeee"
now i want one
He probably felt like he was riding Space Mountain!
"dammit, took me three days to get to the toilet and I didn't even poot"
‚ÄúTime! Sorry, no. Its an, uhh, [tandem](https://youtu.be/Gl3l6Bq6bMo) bicycle‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù
We don't deserve sloths!! üò≠üò≠
Why Don‚Äôt Sloths Fall Out of Trees When They Are Sleeping? 

https://youtu.be/MYZLMvwMPOo
That feeling you get after riding an insane rollercoaster
Hyperdrive
you can see the sloth‚Äôs gratitude.. so beautiful üíñ
the sloth probably felt like he was moving at the speed of light when the guy carried him
‚ÄúThanks- but I would have gotten there by October.‚Äù
Your turtles sure are shaggy.
Suckers
MY HEART!
I watched it in the thumbnail and I‚Äôm like why is he putting a turtle up in a tree? Then I watched it in regular size again, and sloth is saying ‚Äúwrong....    tree......‚Äù It‚Äôs going to take him so long to get home.
Sloth‚Äôs POV: *Get ready to go into hyperspace*
Haha. In my head his like. Oh shit that was so fast! Thank you 'the flash'. But in sloth.
Yeah you know he was trying to wave
What is it about sloths that makes them all so damn slow? Are they all just mentally deficient or something or are they physically incapable of making quick movements
Flash!
Sloth is like dude.... It just took me 5 hours to get down from this thing!
Fist bump!
It's a blessing to my one of my people fly
That must‚Äôve felt like warp speed to that little guy.
Sloth probably: Damn... how they going to leave me hangin... like that
dude probably thought he was going light speed
Thought he was going in for a fist bump üëäüèΩ
he had that zach galifinakis motorcycle face at the end
That was a thumbs up... But they doesn't have thumbs so you gotta use the imagination
What a trippy squirrel.
Grade A human.
He's all like "whoah I'm in the wrong tree.... dude I'm so high"
wow that was amazing.
Kinda hoped for a middle finger at the end
The sloth when he started moving: üèéüèéüöÄüöÄüõ∏üõ∏üî•üò¶
üòê
How are they even alive lol
Sloths are the best animal. Fight me.
What do you call a camel with three humps?

Pregnant!
Dude, you got a 3 finger salute
I love sloths so much you don‚Äôt understand
I want to be friends with every sloth.
it fascinates me that sloths are a real creature, they're so strange
He‚Äôs literally threatening your life.
Lmao just don‚Äôt tell him a joke!
That was is more like, haha fools this works everytime
He's not low.
"But I haven't pooped yet..and this isn't my tree"
Good....................looking...........................my..................guy!
Follow your dreams
I imagine this sloth is now trying to figure out how to make that all happen again as needed.
!Gracias amigo!
What a beautiful creature ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
That was DEFINITELY a thumbs up.
Appreciate it bud
God.... So.... Slow
That would have taken him all day. You just bought him a day
I never realized sloths even blink slowly lol
Anyone else watch this and think someone's home behind those eyes?
Slomonomobrodolie with the epic dangle.
Does Sloth feel how we do on a rocket?
üß°
I wonder if double blink means the same in Slothian as it does in Cattian. *"You good people"*
A lil cutie :)
Do sloths only live in places with no predators at all?
It looks so happy!
Adorable thank you wave ü¶•
OK, I want someone to take that bit with the zoom at the end where he raises his paw and edit it so that he‚Äôs giving us the finger.
He was reaching to turn off his morning alarm clock.
Fun fact: the sloth is physically incapable of farthing.

https://youtu.be/hybnW9FrAEU
So remind me again, do these things survive in the wild, by being cool, or is it a very remote island?
We don‚Äôt deserve sloths.
I looks like he wanted to give the guy a fist bump
They really do move as slow as I thought they did. Even the eye blink was in slow motion lol.
How do sloths servive from their predator animals? I find it crazy that they haven't extinct.
"Whoa! Oh my gosh oh my gosh, so fast, so- I'M FLYING! WHO-HOO! ...Whew. Glad that's over."
Props to the guy for not just dropping him on the road but setting him up halfway up a tree.

I‚Äôd be stoked too if somebody saved me 8 hours of walking.
Flash, flash, 100 yard dash
I'm always wondering if animals feel the way their facial expressions look.
Did that sloth just smile and wave at them
Man what a useless creature
any Naffers?
Reminds me of that Puma vs Sloth video. These guys don't even put up a fight. This is super cute though.
The blink
A motivated three toed sloth can move at around 0.24 km/h (0.15 mph), that is around 267 times slower than a motivated tiger.
Now for Kristen Bell‚Äôs reaction video.
Staaaahp!

Sloths man üòç
He's going warp speed
Being carried by that dude is probably the fastest that sloth has ever moved in its life.
Someone send this to Kristen Bell.
I love a sloth as much as the next guy but id never touch one

That‚Äôs the face of a man who just gained 5 more years of life!
I was expecting a thumbs up, that little wave was just as good.
That‚Äôs so sweet!
They take chill to the next level
This the best ever!!!!
Too fucking cute!
Awe
It's so wholesome it fucking hurts
It looks like a old school Disney animatronic
How are those things not extinct. Also wash your hands. Tons of bacteria on their backs.
Ends up eaten by a lion.
These hairy shellfree turtles are the best. Somebody should bring him in for a mani/pedi tho
This is the fastest he has ever moved.

Aww he said thanks...
Even it‚Äôs blinking is in slow motion. So damn cute.
Why are sloths the cutest creepiest thing ever? Also, I feel like it's a lot of work to move that slow.
Wow, what remarkable creatures!
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúwoah! I am zooming!‚Äù as he crossed the road.
Dark souls 1 wood carving "thank you" that's its voice
Awwwww
Love sloths

Is that a megatherium or a gacha from ark?
Thank you sir. Most beautiful!
He‚Äôs a little slow.
This is so bloody cute. I wish we humans cared more for the animal kingdom üò™it is truly a wonder to behold the beauty of planet earths creatures big and small...
Like a shinkansen just took him to Moriguchi station.
Wow! This is my new favourite animal.

Hey................. Priscilla.............
I love when the guy stops and thinks this is good and realizes the sloth has a fuck ton left to travel to the tree. Lol
I bet he/she felt like Quicksilver for a moment

Did someone post the sloth rant yet?
He cliimbed down whole day to do number 2 and now this...
When your off the xans moving slow as hell
What a pedo
Volume up to hear them chanclas slapping pavement
They even blink slowly
Sloths have always got that face that says "I'm gonna fuck your girl later"
Jesus Christ slow down! I wanna get there, but I wanna get there alive!
PS Battle make the sloth give a thumbs up
How have sloths not gone extinct?
Flash the sloth, thanking in super fast motion.

Man, Disney nailed it in zootopia.
He then died of a heart attack because he'd never moved so fast in his life.
I didn't know it actually move that slowly haha
"Thank you, hooman!"
Imagine if these things were fast
They are really slooooooow....

Sloth zoomies
u/vredditshare
Watch!....where!...your!....going!...
Warp speeeeed!
Why did the sloth cross the road?
I can't look at sloths without thinking about that creepy sloth memes
Love it ‚ô•Ô∏è
I can hear Kristen Bell ovulating.
Just saved him about 73 hours of travelling
Did anyone show this to Kristen bell yet?
Is this footage flipped?
That look at the end, full of gratefulness and admiration. For him, this man is basically the Flash.
Priceless
I preffer this inspiring sloth post [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7rRfKIHxU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ba7rRfKIHxU)
Somehow in the middle of it all the sloth's brain was like "HOLY SHIT IM FLYING!!!!"
All of the sudden he is 3 hours ahead of schedule. Life is good.
Sloths aren‚Äôt meant to travel that close to the speed of light.
"The fuck imma gonna do with the rest of my day now, human"
Imagine if he was trying to head to the other side of the road and was looking at him like "are you serious man! It took me 2 weeks to get that far, now I'm back at the tree I was born in!"
[Another Sloth](https://youtu.be/ba7rRfKIHxU) getting help crossing the road.
Lol anybody else think he was picking up a sea turtle without his shell?
[Sloth Vision](https://media.tenor.com/images/9d9d56522e2ac99f70df4fb1b0e951c9/tenor.gif)
How can that species even exist?
He was like .. whybdid you put me in the wrong tree
Hey kid,

You‚Äôre ducked.
The kind of people the world needs more of.
Why does he look like ringo starr lmaooo
So wait, sloths are just cool to pick up? TIL
Flash! Flash, the hundred yard dash!
Probably felt like he was tripping balls, being carried to that tree!
That sloth looks and moves like a robot
Was expect a thumbs up at the end. Wait, they don‚Äôt have a thumb!
He‚Äôs waving thank you in sloth time. Lol
I was going to say don‚Äôt bother reposting this video unless it‚Äôs the version with ‚ÄúI believe I can fly‚Äù playing in the background but then I remembered that R Kelly is a pedo so thanks you‚Äôre doing the lords work
He is speed now
I keep hearing him talk in the turtle voice from Finding Nemo
Don‚Äôt be fooled by cute looks. A woman was caring for a sloth at a zoo, routine check up, all the sudden it starts to crush her hand. Did this all while smiling.
Tttthhhhhaaaaaannnnnnnnkkkkkkk............. yyyyyoooooooooooouuuuuuuuu
awww he was jus waving
They even blink slowly! üòÜ
I shall take it as a badge of honour next time I‚Äôm called a sloth. 

I want to get back to that feeling, whatever it was that I was doing because it obviously left my peers ripe with envy.
they look high as f 24/7
THIS COMMENT SECTION NOW BELONGS TO THE NAFFERS
Pretty sure hes baked out of his mind
Plan for next year? Resuming climbing the tree!
How can such a thing have such a humanoid face?  That was definitely a thank you face.
I hate them so much for being slow. they're so slow !!!
Beeeeeeeee gooooooooddd
That sloth just time travelled
Sloths look like weird animatronics like each eye blinks at a different time
This is a really old one, lol
God he‚Äôs slow
This is so great, but how the hell has such a slow, gentle soul lasted this long in the wild without going extinct?
Quaid...Quaid...Quaid...Open your mind...Open your mind...
Just feeling grateful to be a human.
Aww! It looks like the little guy is saying thank you!
They look like muppet creatures that have come to life
I swear if he gave the man a thumbs up...
He looked grateful. Awe!
I'm waiting for someone to comment about why it's bad to touch sloths. There's always that comment. What is it this time, plague fleas? Detrototoxin? Leprosy?!

Come at me! why is this man going to die for touching the sloth? Stop hiding in the bushes and tell us!
The sloth said üëÅüëÑüëÅ
What if it had been walking backwards and just almost made it?
How have they survived this long?
Made me tear up.  I just saved a huge caterpillar in a QT lot.
It even blinks slowly.
üòç
Deja vu instantly played in that sloth's mind the moment he got picked up
Aww this feels like when I help the elderly at work. :)
Everytime I see a sloth now I think of that DMV scene in Zootopia.
I wasn't wearing my glasses when I saw this and for the first two seconds legit thought it was turtle without a shell oh god
‚ÄúSlow down you son of a bitch!!‚Äù
HOW did this animal not go extinct?
Reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/ba7rRfKIHxU)
Holy shit. I looked it up and Wikipedia says they move 4 meters (14 ft) per MINUTE. That‚Äôs 2.6 inches per second. I knew they were slow but not that slow
I‚Äôm unsure how have sloths survived evolution, but I am glad they have.
The slow blinks at the end makes it.
That is funny
That sloth was thankfully, and he/ she showed it at the end. So nice to see God people doing the right thing, even with ride people joining their horns because everyone is always in a rush. Show down and take in the beauty that was this moment! <3 :)
"Thank you, sweet primate friend!"
Imagine if sloths were agile, aggressive animals. They‚Äôd be terrifying.
What the guy did was awesome. Obviously the sloth needed help, and I am not advocating for leaving it in the road. However, this is *exactly* how novel diseases get introduced into the human population. 

Still mad props to the man.  But it‚Äôs so scary to think of a random pandemic-level virus that has grown inside of some animal, and a little kid goes to help it and gets scratched or bit. Boom. Patient zero.
Sloths live in the beautiful jungles of Costa Rica.  We were with a guide in a Gator and were pretty much tearing down a road in the jungle.   Our guide was determined to find a sloth for us.  The guide told us sloth are hard to spot.  He made a curve then slammed on the brakes almost causing us to fall out of the Gator.  He said 'over there'.   We were quiet and looked and looked.  No sloth.  Finally he went tree by tree for us until we saw a brown ball up in the tree.  The sloth was taking a nap or just resting.  I have no idea how he spotted it.   We piled out of the Gator and started walking over to the tree which was 25 yards away.  Walking through the jungle is not fun if you worry about things like snakes, crocodiles, lizards, spiders, etc. like I do.  In my mind they were all there, ready to pounce.  We got to the tree and snapped our pictures even if by that time it was pouring down rain.  Not exactly thrilling but cool nevertheless.  I don't think the sloth cared.

There were headhunters in Peru and they had a lively business going provide shrunken heads to tourists.  Creating a shrunken head is pretty involved as you can imagine.  They ran out of real shrunken human heads because of the high demand for them so they came up with a alternative.  They used sloth heads instead.  The article said that no one realized the difference.  So if Uncle Billy shows you his prized shrunken head from Peru don't be fooled and take a close look.  It may be a sloth head.
Is it doing "I like you" blinks like a cat?
They'd never moved so fast before in their life
You saved me a month of walking,man!
Such a classic
‚ÄúThank you hoomans üíï‚Äù
Sweet baby
He's an entire week ahead of schedule now. Thanks a ton, bub.
Woah Dude, slow down
Groot
Flash Flash, 100 yard dash.
He/She looks sad at the endü•∫
Turns out his home was on the OTHER side of the street and you put him the sloth equivalent of 1 billion miles away from his family and they'll never see eachother again.
Fastest that guy ever traveled
Hey! What are u doing! This wasn‚Äôt my house!
Nice
Sloths are so freaking adorable!!!!!
Seriously tho? Why TF are sloths so slow?! Every body movement is like molasses!
Oh my goodness it's so cute
I love the slow wave at the end....thanks dude..
I love my country Brazil ‚ù§Ô∏è
What....do....you....call....a....three....humped....camel?
Weird animal... Looks like animatronics in movies from the 80s-90s, like ET.
Slot be like :)))
He maybe had a huge fight to get to the road for help, and then you put him back! Argh just fun! Lovely to see humens help animals in aid!
I wonder what he felt moving at that alarming speed. He probably turned around thinking ‚Äúwhoa.... wtf was that?!!‚Äù
Those claws freak me out
Look Ma I'm flying!
Please give us the middle finger, please...!
I love this so much. This is what I‚Äôm talking about. I want to buy this man a beer ASAP.
"You literally just saved me an entire day."
Looks like a turtle without a shell.
The guy kinda looks like a sloth, no?
Do other animals do the slow blink smile?
I still don‚Äôt understand how these guys are still with us. After millions and millions of years, how they not all get eaten.
I dont know how cognitive these animals are but im Fairley convinced that was a thank you gesture
Bruh must‚Äôve felt like he teleported.
Absolutely adorable.
I love how he acknowledged the guy who carried him before getting back to business
A guy has to go to the forest floor to take his weekly shit.
Oh my Goddddddddd üòçü§Øüëèüèºüôèüèº‚ù§Ô∏è
Best Version if this video: https://youtu.be/6mwuXJOU2QA
nice guys saved him 3 days on his commute
It was probably terrifying for him to travel that fast.
The sloth must of thought he was travelling at the speed of light when the guy was carrying him just walking lol
Fun Fact: Sloths aren‚Äôt naturally that slow, they go slow purposely to conserve energy.
This is godly
Nice guy.i wonder how long they live? As. Long as they're not caught in mid road.
