You can't see his wagging tail. But you can see his whole body wiggling ever so slightly.
Sorry, [out of cucumbers](http://i.imgur.com/uZRpyCW.gifv), please come back tomorrow sir.

It's a doge thru window!
It's always a Shiba 
Off topic, but that's an interesting window design if it opens from the outside? I don't thunk I've ever seen that before.
Ahh is this the trailer for the disney reboot to Howls Moving Castle? That wizard is barking mad from what I remember 
Cutest drug dealer I've ever seen.

I want a Shiba so bad :( I heard they're little shits though, are they really that bad ? 
omg this is so cute! he looks so poofy!
This is like one of those piggybanks where you press a button and a dog comes out of it

[deleted]
I've heard the service at this place is awfully ruff...
I knew it. Before the gif finished I would see a Shiba Inu in the end. WOW. 
Welcome to Good Pupper, home of the Good Pupper. Can I take your order?

Who is that doge in the window? *bork* *bork*
Confess your sins!
"What's the password?"
I love how you can see his head wiggling back-and-forth towards the end because you know his tail is going like crazy.
I thought the subreddit grew sentience and tried to message me for a second with that post title.
I love the hand placement. "How may I help you today?"
I feel like somebody lifted it up to the window.  You notice how softly and symmetrical it's paws land?
Nobody sees the wizard! Not nobody not no-how!
Nobody gets in to see the Wizard- Not nobody not nohow!
The dog is in
why is this dog locked in a pitch black room with a service window?
The dogtor is in
Would you like the bork special?
For some reason I just knew this has to be in Japan.
Awwww, I'd like to bump him on the head, softly, of course.

Ugh why did I try to turn my volume up üòë
NOBODY SEES THE WIZARD

The wizard can't see you right now. He's giving a doggo his tennis ball. He travelled from afar following the yellowbork road

He looks like he will either barter with you or give you a quest.
What wizardy is this? A screen that acts like a window? Madness!

I wanna give that dog a hug
I'd like to order a hot dog.
"Sir, we are very busy at this time, what do you need"
Love the end when you can tell its tail is wagging.
"Will you be my master?"

You can see his tail wagging by the smaaaaaall wiggle happening in his body. So cute 
Oh my gosh. I'm not normally affected by cute things but I actually went "awww..." in my mind when seeing this. 
Now that's a horse of a different colour!
I love how you can tell in the movement of his face there's definitely a butt wiggle going on down there
/u/Ahlxvx
This has got to be the greatest thing ever! "Hey we're out of muffins, come back tomorrow!"
Welcome to Doggos drive through, how can i help you?

If you watch closely you can tell by the head movements that  he's wagging his tail.

Why are you able to open the window from the outside?!
Shibas are such awesome dogs. I miss mine :(
*Woof* " Welcome to KFC, can I take your order?"
Sorry out of fires.
So no one's going to mention they're opening the window from the outside? 
Most dogs would be barking their asses off. Not this guy. This guys cool. Hes a cool guy
Ha. You can tell his tail is wagging like crazy.
No shirt, no shoes, no pants, no treat

NO! Service
Very service, much customer. Sorry, couldn't help myself. 
My cat does this same thing. It's so adorable.
Why do they have a window that you can open from the outside?
Wooo hooo, big summer blowout.

You see that s/he's wagging his tail.
I was expecting a cat.

His head wiggles cus his tail is :)
He gets up there so gracefully. 
Love how you can tell he's wagging his tail.
[Was expecting Javert gif](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/978/UiXAker.gif). Was not disappointed.

What type of dog is this, such a friendly cute face.
Bork! Ur order pls
Doggo drive through? Yes please
Dog machine broke

Shibas have got to be the most adorable type of dogs out there
My last dog was a mix between a Shiba and a German Shepherd.... they really are amazing dogs. 10/10 would adopt another.

First thing I want to ask watching this is: why do you have a window opening from the outside ?
I love the way him wagging his tail makes him wiggle ever so slightly. 
I'll just lay down on the couch
