He/she has graduated from I-want-to-learn-everything to I-already-know-everything.
I have sweater envy. (I would have kitty envy too but I have my own orange love bug.)
So cute!
Ayy left hand gang
As a kitten: fully alert, eyes wide open and reacts to everything

As a cat: having a doze, got this life shiz worked out and just chillin'
When my sister was in medical school, she had a Bearded Dragon who would just hang out on her hoodie and nuzzle with her while she studied. She would use him and a clock while her head was in a book, she knew it was getting late when he would crawl up under or into her hood to sleep.
Kitten: Help! 

Cat: Zzz... Zzz...
The safe spot.
Intern at the desk vs. one who's been there for 10 yrs.

I would have preferred if the sweaters had been reversed.

Then it would have looked as though it faded over the years while the lil'cutie grew.
Your cat have glorious peanuts! What a majestic kitty.
In quarantine since 2017
Peace and love 🤗

I am perturbed by the way you hold that pen.

I used to have a desk buddy, he passed away though from old age but since he was a kitten he always sat on my desk whilst I done my homework and listened to me ramble about basically nothing and just looked at me with these glowing eyes, I don’t have a desk buddy anymore and I want a pet who will fulfil my needs
Daaaaaaawwwww
This person got almost more Karma than the fake brain cancer dude, by NOT LYING ABOUT BRAIN CANCER
Adorable! 

But also, are you a leftie??

Wait, how long have you been working from home ?!
Your choice of sweaters go well with your cat. Lovely
My cat was like that for a while, until I got done house sitting for my dad. Let me tell you, it really is something special to have a desk buddy
Adult cats are cuter than kittens.
He grew into your arms.
That's a big boi!!
Looks like a huge spider on the stack of books in the back!
