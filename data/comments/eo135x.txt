This is just too cute. She literally only came over to help and then walked away. Love how animals get along
What's going on there in the next room? Looks like kitty jungle gym heaven!
I love her concentrated pause while she worked out what was needed ‚ù§
I love how the little one reaches her tiny paw in despair, before giving up. Cats are so dramatic.
And she just walks away like, ‚ÄúThere, I got it for you...‚Äù. LOL, fooking awesome!
Heard pained meowing coming from upstairs once, so ran up to see if my kitty had hurt himself. No, he'd just knocked his ping pong ball under the vacuum cleaner, and couldn't get it out again.

My current cat however, will knock his sister's ball under things just so she can't have it. He is a championship level arsehole, but very cute.
What‚Äôs that weird German noises in the background?
That's so adorable üò¢
Is that Vikings Season 2, bj√∂rn fighting Rollo in the background?
I had a cat Mrs. Miagi, this is the kind of stuff she would never do, didn‚Äôt live up to her name.
awwww
r/animalsbeingbros
That cat is nicer than most siblings
Wait a second. Did that bigger cat just realize the smaller cat was in need of help and provided it?

I'm asking because I saw a post about that exact behavior recently stating that so far only humans, grey parrots, bonobos and another type of primates has passed that test so far.

Is there an expert here that can give more insight?

EDIT: The responses prompted me to look up some further information and I found [this](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/09/feathered-friends-study-shows-selfless-parrots-helping-peers).

However, an argument could be made that that's exactly what the older cat is doing: there is no profit for the larger cat in helping the smaller one, however it helps anyways. There are no resources exchanged, though, so I don't know if a comparison is reasonable here.
i love how she just went there to help the little one ‚ô•Ô∏è
Cats r so interesting man
How sweet!
This is so freaking awesome. I could watch this over and over again
Aaaww the little ones raised paw when he couldn't reach it sooo cute
I've never seen a slipper so smooshed

A near catastrophe
I love that this happened. Why do people call animals dumb when they have the capacity for this?  
  
I know humans that wouldn't help.
These are two very adorable cats!
What are the cats names?
I'm confused by the orientation of the microwave.
Just look at that little kitty city in the background! They must love it.

r/catculations
I made a similar cat toy for my cats...a tiny stuffed animal( I sprayed the toy with catnip too) connected to an elastic cord hanging from the middle of a doorway

Of all the store bought toys they also had they played with this thing the most

BTW Check the reviews on different brands of spray catnip...some are virtually crap products and some your cats will love(price is not necessarily an indicator of quality either)
And people say cats are selfish...
Reminds me of [dis video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whVMP6BqcqU) :)

what is going on in the background, dragonball z?
Aww she literally got that bait down for her sister and immediately left ( that moment of focus though üëåüî•)
Cats are so damn smart.
Thanks u/yourmumwashere

Here I was expecting big sis kitty to pass a broom over to our boy, telling him to use his brain or something. I'm glad that cat siblings are above my imaginations.

Reddit's best thing in 3 years. Maybe more.
is that the witcher in the background? i think i recognized the german voice actor of henry cavill.
LMAO, she just pulled the thread down and walked away again. Thats fantastic.
The fridge orientation is not effecient
I was watching this in a train in Germany and became so fucking irritated with the background noise lol. Assumed someone was letting their kids watch a show without headphones
Everybody's talking about the hallway when we really should be talking about the enhanced cat with abnormal(for a cat) intelligence.  I mean c'mon!  You all know how self centered cats are, don't act like you don't! Doing something for another cat ... ANOTHER CAT?!  That cat is evolved!
Wholesome content
That's so sweet!
Ok that was awesome
My ragdoll completely destroyed that toy, he‚Äôs an animal!
What show was you watching
What a sweetheart!! Such good babies.
Cat reactions always special
Omg, that is so sweet. I love that kitty.
r/donthelpjustfilm
Random cats of kindness
Hold up, let me just.... figure this out
I am telling you, had it not been for us humans, these cats would have ruled the world
Could you see the calculations and thoughts going through her mind? Such a nice sister.
I just read an article about some official test that only a few species pass (I think it mentioned a type of ape and a parrot) where animals understand and help another that's in trouble. I feel like this deserves a look. The 2nd cat was clearly not interested in playing with the toy and only wanted to help the other.
That's the nicest thing I've ever seen a cat do.
Increasing our understanding that we don't actually understand animals. Maybe we aren't as smart as we think.
Big sister knows that if it wasn‚Äôt for that toy little kitten would be using her as the play toy.
Can some one remake this gif with a bunch of math equations overlaid while the cat figures out optimum angel and trajectory. Thanks!
Some hardcore gay porn going on in the background
This be the wholesome content i needed today
That German porn sounds intense.
I love how she walks away nonchalantly too. "I got you lil one, no prob."
What the heck is happening in the background?? In German somebody is saying"I won't die" and another answers "yes you will! If I want so". Epic German threat.
BuT cAtS aRe So mEan
"There ya go."
*leaves immediately*
It is so intentional on the older cats part. She gets it untangled and walks away!
It took me longer than it should have to realize the background sound was a TV show instead of a washing machine, and I was *really* concerned about how unbalanced it was.
***SHUT UP AND TAKE MY UPVOTE!!!***
This sounded a lot like /r/SoundsLikeMusic at first, and I was thinking, "wow that washing machine is really adding to the drama here..." Then I find out it's some German movie or something.
This does put a smile upon my face
Wow that is a large cat, reaching almost as long as the refrigerator height!
Ich h√∂re deutsch und ich upvote
OP, did you record this? If so, when? This little lady looks JUST like my cat and we don‚Äôt know her origin story so I‚Äôd be curious to know.
I'm surprised at the amount of empathy (ie. understanding the mental state of the little sister) shown by the big sister! There was recently a study about which animals can read a need in another individual and respond with help, and iirc it was only great apes and African Greys that could do this. I guess we now must add cats!
What porn are you listening to?
And people say cats are assholes
Love the gay sex in the background.
Oh i adore this
This is the cutest shit I've ever seen

ahah
If this was my childhood, my big bro would try and fail, then guilt the fuck out of me and make me think I broke the toy forever.

Then mom/dad would come back from work and fix it. And id be too afraid to every play with it ever again
good girl!

Nope. I guess someone was watching an action movie.

Cuties!! Big sister definitely has the swagger which implies she is thinking "you're welcome, idiot" as she walks away though. In true cat fashion. lol
wtf is that sound, are you watching porn or something.

the kitten is adorable tho
Oh my gosh, my heart can't take this level of cute first thing in the morning. So sweet! She fixed it for them, and just looks at them like "You're welcome"

Are we just going to pretend those amazing shelves at various levels for the cats don't exist in the background ? What an fantastic setup.
Can someone do the gif with the calculations thing? :)
/u/vredditdownloader
I wonder why cats always sit there for a minute or two before the leap. Like are there all these complex physics equations going inside there or is like "eye of the tiger" playing? It never seems to have any parallel to whether or not they actually make the jump.
That casual, walk away and look at the lil kitten like ''Thats how its done bitch, now play''
That is so sweet. I love kitty cats. <3

Wait, is that room right through the door an actual dedicated cat room? With all kinds of shelves installed for them to climb on? That is fantastic.
 It's worth it for the big sister cat to keep the little one occupied so sis can be undisturbed.
This made my day!

Background:(german)

"don't die like an idiot!"

"I won't die! As long as I don't want to!"
It bothers me that your fridge and microwave are oriented in that way.
DOCH DAS WIRST DU!!!
Aww, that's so cute.  Gets it down AND walks away...
Ohhh this is so wholesome!
concentrated paws
I thought that was a spider and I freaked out
I‚Äôm the furthest thing from a cat person, but that is adorable. It‚Äôs beautiful seeing empathy in animals (including humans).
But why is the microwave skew??
I need to know what‚Äôs playing In the background.
Not gonna lie I was hoping that the other cat would come flying out of nowhere like a ninja and smack the toy free. Ah well...this'll do
Legit thought the audio was the start of a soundtrack to accompany the cat. Up until the punching sounds started.

Even the music is more intense when the toy gets stuck, adding to the drama
For everyone asking y the microwave or the fridge are facing the wrong direction, its facing the kitchen.

a long string is actually dangerous for a cat, the string can wrap around their neck
As an older brother, that is not love. That is the little shit is going to annoy me if I don't fix it. Okay it is a tiny bit of love.

I just thinking thats what I should do with my cat
Love that german sound in the background: ich werde nicht sterben! Doch das wirst du!
This is certainly not the subreddit for this question but i recently saw some articles talking about the short list of animals capable of recognizing what another wants and helping them. I feel like this subreddit and others like r/animalsbeingbros are constantly showing that many many animals are capable of these kinds of things. Is the burden of proof in and the stigma around animals having emotions still so strong that the literature is way behind? It seems any pet owner or even just someone with any close relationship to an animal would know that most are easily capable of this and more.

 Sorry. Maybe a little heady for this sub...

Please be VERY CAREFUL of these hanging string toys!  I put one up for my kitty many years ago and when she batted it, it went up and swung around her neck as she was trying to bat it as it came down!  Luckily I was literally 1 foot away on my knees because I had just, just installed it on a kitty climbing pedestal that I had and I caught her under her bottom as she came down with it still around her neck!  I, of course, removed the string instantly but she was freaked out and so was I!  That thing came off of the pedestal and I never used it again!  I hugged her for about an hour and all was well after that, thank Heaven!!!
