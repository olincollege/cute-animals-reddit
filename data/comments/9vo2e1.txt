Obviously he‚Äôs overworked and just pulled 18hour shift 
Excuse me, that is the *owner* of the train company, Mr. Meowskers
Rub his belly that‚Äôll teach him
He made it home: https://www.lovemeow.com/ginger-cat-saunters-into-subway-train-to-take-a-nap-2343550678.html
Good ol' German trains
He's had a long day of meetings in the city about very important cat business and needed a little rest on the way back home.
What do you mean "like"?
You should absolutely teach this guy a lesson by giving him scritches
Yea but he‚Äôs cute tho
I have the same cat, maybe just drunk

If every other seat was full, I would stand.
Catspreading?
I can‚Äôt see him behind the camera but look at the cat!
but he does own the train, he's a cat he owns everything he sees

Deutsche Bahn
German cat probably riding schwarz like all of us do over here.
Yep, he‚Äôs an asshole

He's allowed
Hamburg!? I'm on the s Bahn right meow and looks nearly identical!!
Bloody catspreading. Down with cats and their privilege!
He's exhausted because he was trying to throw something away in that mini bin, but the darn things are always full with an empty bottle of beer. 
Meowspreading 
that's heartbreaking ‚Äì did you bring this little guy to a shelter??
Def drunk
Looks like a deutsche Bahn Train. May I ask where you took this pic?
Look at this fat cat riding trains and taking naps. I don't even have enough lentils to get in the station.
WHY IS NOBODY CUDDLING HIM
That IS his train! He can have anything he wants! ü•∞
Catspreading 
It runs deep. Every city and apparently multiple species... the homeless camping out on the transit systems for the A/C. 
I say he can have the whole train cart, don't wanna disturb the little fella. :D
Cat owner, can confirm this behavior.
It's a cat. They own everything.
I‚Äôd give up my seat for a cat.
He DOES own that train.
Catspreading is a Real Problem 
No, that asshole *definitely* owns the train. Clearly. I mean, he licked it and rubbed his face on it and everything!
I would sit on the floor to let him sleep there (and obviously pet him) !
#Catspreading 
I can TELL that that's a German train and now I'm tempted to search the whole country for this adorable little asshole
But he does own the train
Let‚Äôs get Tan on the case
Thought this was r/mildyinfuriating for a second
He's allowed
where is he going?
Wtf what if a pregnant cat needed to sit down.
For real does this kitty have a home now?
HE‚ÄôS HAD A LONG DAY!
What a bastard, if he doesn't move someone should just sit on his legs.
This looks like the Deutsche Bahn
Looks just like my old commuter train in Germany. 
Friends it's not even a packed carriage, he may well adjust to acommodate other commuters if it starts to fill up. It's not a rude thing to do!
Stupid jerk, probably took up two spaces in the parking lot with his litter box too...
Awwww kitty. I would be the asshole and wake the lil cutie up with pets
r/awwsholes
Well, he owns it now. 
Thank you for traveling with Deutsche Bahn.
He's a cat, he owns that train now and every human on it.
No that's Skimbleshanks the Railway cat the cat of the railway train.

As long as we're competing, in my younger days I shared a full sized water bed with my 180 lb St. Bernard.  Then I got married.  Then I wanted my St. Bernard back.  
Catspreading!
Is there a sub dedicated to cats riding the subway?
Catspreading
The nerve some people have.
I have a few of these vagrants in my house, taking up my chair, my couch, and anywhere I like to sit. Like typical vagrants they vomit wherever they damn well please.
That cat's something I can't explain!
He does. Don‚Äôt bother him. 
r/stolentrainseats
You don‚Äôt know how hard of a day he‚Äôs had. He needs all the comfort and space he can get, it‚Äôs hard being a cat overlord.
He does own the train.

Ease up on the fella. He's had a catastrophic day!

Proof that cats don‚Äôt give a shit. 
Why is there a cat on the bus?
They should pour milk over him/her for cat spreading. 
This needs to be illegal!  SOMEBODY GET THA DANM BLEACH! Seriously tho that's amazing.
He's clearly tired from a long shift. He earned this nap. 
What a cute lil asshole
Feet on the seats too. 
Typical man. I bet there's at least 5 pregnant women who could use a seat! Learn manners disgusting man!
Did that freeloader even pay for his seat?
With that kind if cuteness, he definitely owns the train.
Hey don't be rude. He's had a long day.
He's a cat, he owns everything and there's nothing you can do about it
I can't stop thinking about if it has kittens and just went on a ride to go get food for them
Its cuz he does üòäüòã you go little dude! Own that train
That‚Äôs the handicatted section.
Random fact: this is a german train. I don‚Äôt know why I even told you that 
Cats on trains make me feel both happy and sad
Cat-Spreading is a serious issue. It is not a joking matter.

I don't know this for a fact but I'm pretty sure this asshole skipped on buying a ticket, as well. What is this? Anarchy? 
This guy deserves on r/iamatotalpieceofshit
Everyone is worried, but that cat has zero anxiety.  He either knows exactly where he's going, or is with his person.

Why is a cat on the train?   Cute, but weird.   Definitely cute though.
He probably didn't even pay for a ticket. 
Scootch yo cootch, meow.

Catspreading is a thing
Prick. 
Lmao 
Why don't I evar find kittehs on the train??? üôÑ
This is the difference between cats and dogs. Cats can hop up on anything and take a nap. Dog need to stay grounded an watched over to feel safe. 
Orange cats make good mousers. 
Well, are YOU gonna tell him to move?
Skimbleshanks?
He'd just having a bad day, give him a break
If you're in Boston, nickname him "Charlie."
gotrain toronto?
If I sits, I FITS.
He is traveling without tickets, is cuteness new currency now?
It's a cat. They own everything. They just let us use it.

Hamburg SB???
That's the same guy that was knocking off items I placed on the edge of the seat.     
awwshole
I wonder how much money the company that manufactured those trains saved by mounting the seats on milk crates.
Asshole and cat are pretty much synonymous. Love my little bitch though. 
He does own the train. Further questions?
he thought they are blue parking spaces, give him a break!
HE DOES
Which S-Bahn is this? I gotta travel there just for this
That‚Äôs Captain Whiskers, he does own the train. He‚Äôs invested heavily in the city‚Äôs public transportation
Cats are terrible people.
Uhh, you tell him that. I‚Äôm good standing.

Pretty sure he's able to lick his balls/ass
Fucking bastard 
Menspreading at its finest
He‚Äôs just trying to sleep man leave him alone

With a coat that fine I'm sure he's the kind of gent to pay for three seats and use two 
Is cat. This fact confirms asshole status.

Cats are awesome folks. Go to a shelter and adopt one. You can get one literally any age you want. You won‚Äôt regret it.

How to get your cat keyed 101
Fucking Bosco!
Can you even use the A word in this sub?

Take the A[www] train.
So then push the cat off the seats. Simple as that
great post
Parents had a dog when I was a child, a friend of theirs spent when he was traveling through town (I had to give up my bed).  Our dog used to sleep with me in my bed.  I was small, so she she would shift around there was plenty of room.

In the morning, the friend was sleeping on the flood because when the dog started to move in the night, he pushed back.  The dog growled and he decided discretion was better than bravery!
He does own the train 
Poor cold baby
Typical cat... it‚Äôs a good thing they‚Äôre cute. üòä
He‚Äôs had a hard day lay off 
They never stick to one seat, the number of times I've ended up sitting on the floor next to the chair lol, yeah not so great.
S/he does own it. You must pay your fare in tuna. 

Least he/she is cute ;-;
Bet he didn't buy a ticket either -  what a jerk...
Dare I say it but that's not an asshole, it's p**** if I ever seen one lol sorry had to.
aww
He‚Äôs a cat. He DOES own the train. 
Is this Istanbul?
To be fair, he does.
Ahhhh, Deutsche Bahn

That looks like this outdoor cat I know named ludwig who wanders around the o train station near my university. 
Probably does own the train.
Here in Sweden rules for dogs and humans like where to shit, piss, move, use collar and such doesn't apply to cats.  


We aswell as all other animals should all have had the same benefits. How amazing wouldn't it had been?!

Cat spreading is disgusting.  Another example of the Catriarchy run amok.
I bet the kitty wants to be held but is constantly disappointed that people keep sitting in different seats instead.
What a cutie.
He had a long day okay
Bold of you to assume he DOESNT own the train

It would be sad if that was a stray cat that just ended up in a random town it didn't know
The only thing that would improve this picture is if you showed a bunch of commuters standing crowded together unable to get a seat due to the cat
