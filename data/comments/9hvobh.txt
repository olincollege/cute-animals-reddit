They got her a gift, too! Aww! 
Awww! I just want to hug her and wish her a happy birthday. Too cute.
She is too adorable!!!
She seems nice 
The best birthday surprises are the ones you don't expect. Once I remember punching in at work and the machine playing happy birthday. It was just a machine but it somehow meant a lot to me in that moment.
I miss my Grandma.
Be kind to people. Love them. 


They are hurting and they need it. 
[deleted]
Oh my God that's so adorable my heart hurts. I have a vague lump in my throat and I want HER TO NEVER DIE OR FEEL PAIN 
This made me so emotional. 
This is definitely r/wholesomegifs material 
I lurk typically 24/7 but I've had a few drinks because it's Friday and I just have to say her face made my night before I even went out.
She still has the childlike wonder.
Our elderly need this kind of attention. They're lovely and mostly lonely people.
That’s all it takes. Minimal effort. It takes minimal effort to be kind and nice to people. Remember that next time you’re out and about.
Selfish question: the woman in this video reminds me so much of my ex-girlfriends mother. We’ve been broken up for nearly 2 years— but I’ve never forgotten the love and support her mother gave me. Absolutely wonderful woman— but no desire to get back together with her daughter. 


Would it be a weird move to send my ex-girlfriend’s mother a letter, just thanking her for everything she did for me? I feel guilty I never properly expressed my gratitude at the time— but don’t want her to be weirded out by some random card from her daughters old boyfriend. 
Some humans just look like they are so kind/heartwarming and that lady definitely looks like one of those people!
This lady looks like she would bake the most amazing chocolate chip cookies.
And you just know they wouldn’t have bothered if she wasn’t someone that they really liked. Someone that really deserved a sweet surprise.
Waitresses never kiss me on the cheek.
She looks genuinely moved by this, very good wholesome stuff.
Props to the waitress, what a genuinely warm hug and peck on the cheek, bless her heart too. 

Back when my dad was still living, and in an assisted living facility, I would see him and his elderly floor mates very often.

Nothing made them light up more than a young person spending time with them, the younger the better.

And if you brought a baby, we’ll forget about it, plan on spending the whole day because you will see the sheer joy that a baby will bring to this generation that raised a lot of us.

If you’re a teenager reading OP’s post with a smile. Say hello to someone this darling woman’s age, help them with their groceries, or pay for their coffee. More often than not, you won’t be disappointed. Your heart will swell like the Grinch’s when he clapped eyes on little CindyLoo Who.

Here’s hoping this woman has many more birthdays and each are filled with this much joy, if not more. 
Can all things on the internet be things like this please 
Looks like they dropped a heavy gift bag on her too. 
When we get older, we don't put as much value on our birthdays. It's easy to just let them pass by with minimal fuss when we're adults. But something like this, this little reminder that it is an important day, especially to just a casual acquaintance, is incredibly nice and meaningful.
Oh my god she seems like an absolute sweetheart, she's the sorta customer I miss from working customer service.
This is so precious, and her husband is wearing a checkered shirt too!

She seems a really, really lovely person. :)
That makes me cry. That's more than I got on my birthday. It's nice to be noticed and feel wanted. 
The amount of feels I’m having right now...
I want to just give her a squeeze! Her face is just pure joy and appreciation. 
This looks irish
I am a cold, bitter, broken old man and even I liked this one.
I LOVE THIS!!!!
These are the types of people that make working at a restaurant totally worth it! Happy birthday to this sweet soul who is obviously so deeply cared for! 
She’s perfect for the old guy from UP
Just got off the phone with my mom wishing her a happy birthday. After seeing this I would have given a lot to do this same thing for my mom
Can we talk about how they match?

What a beautiful moment! 
This brings tears to my eyes. My grandmother and I had a diner we would get breakfast at almost everyday. Once she became weaker we went less and less. Everyone at the restaurant knew us by name and had our order in before we even sat down, we truly felt like family. She would write personal cards and get gifts for every staff member on their birthdays and holidays. Everyone loved her and would come out of the kitchen to give hugs and kisses. She passed away a year ago. This brings me so many good memories about her thank you. 
You’re going to make me cry.
Wow really nice!  Small gesture but it goes so far!
Man I wish there was a subreddit for happy old people
I work in a hospital ER and the other day and one of our patients came in on his 97th birthday. He had no nobody with him.

The catering service sent up a little chocolate cake and all the nurses came into his room and sung him happy birthday. He was so happy he was crying. 
/r/eyebleach
Awww
Happy birthday!
u/commonvanilla Do you know this woman? She looks very much like my mother and has very similar mannerisms. 
Oh my god she’s so cute! 10/10, would hug
I need a hug like that rn. 
The way she looked at them after she gave her a hug and put her face in her hands was so endearing. Props to that staff!
I fucking love how appreciative people are. This is some good shit, fuck yea it’s good to see this
OP here after a sound night’s sleep (no school, no sleep deprivation tonight). 

I can’t believe what a beautiful response this has gotten. This video I brightened my entire weekend after a stressful week and I’m overjoyed to see so many people liking it too. Reading through all the nice comments directed to this video and to the other commenters...it’s such a change from normal reddit.

For some who have asked, no it isn’t me. This is a video I found off Instagram that was too beautiful not to share.


What gentle soul! A ball of positive energy, an most of all, a destroyer of cakes and baked goods
Can I hug her?
so precious 
Awwwww the rest of the world, listen up. Be this. Please. I hate not having this everywhere. We would all live in heaven just for a little bit if we could do this 
Brb melting
I bet she makes amazing cookies
Sure, the granny is adorable. 

But she looks like a Grade-A certified Badass with her collar popped like that. Like she could go full John Wick on you if your not careful
That is a woman that does not get appreciated enough in her daily life. 
This makes me want to hug my mom. 
These are the people that deserve to be happy for as long as they last. Make they're later years their best years. 
People like this made waiting tables almost worth it.
Tickled pink!
Meanwhile in other threads little spoiled shits are like "ugh! I can't believe someone would do that to me!"
i miss my nana
I need a hug from this sweet lady. 
 I react this way every time I’m given cake, even if I’m buying it for myself
She looks like such a genuine person.
she deserves so much more than free cake ♡
Delightful!!
Oh my god that was the cutest thing I have ever seen
So cute! So much happy! I love it. She’s so appreciative. 
I haven't recieved a birthday gift since I was like 14 years old. I'd probably react that way to free birthday cake too!
 Haven’t had cake in my bday in over 10 years. I’m a 35 year old man, I think I would even get a little teary eyed. 
This seriously brought a tear to my eye. So sweet.
I don't know this lady but I love her so much.
awwe. I worked at a restaurant for 4 years as a server/busser. This elderly couple always came in at 1pm. God I loved them. One day the wife didn’t come. She had passed away. :( my boss let me take the day off. Sometimes when you’re working at restaurants you really look forward to seeing your regulars. 
That made her year. This is awesome. This comment will get buried but I don’t care. This video is amazing.
Give her everything! 
So precious! 
I’d love to run a little cafe just so I can make these kinds of friendships 
I literally feel unworthy of watching her pureness she is downright an angel 
I love her already..
her reaction is priceless <3
I audibly whispered aww.. my friend heard, was interested, and ultimately awwgreed
Omg she’s the cutest. I want to be friends with her. 

PS. I’m a 26 year old guy. 
I wish I grow old like her many decades after and people around are still as kind
Old people are cuter than babies, don't @ me
I want to give that woman a hug 
Awww Happy Birthday!! We all love you and you’re adorable!!
Sweet, reminds me of my angel mother. My mother deserves her life story to be published in the Library of Congress archives. And all of love I can give her.  Love you mom! 
Old people are awesome. 
SHE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED
What a joy to be loved. 
I thought puppies were the cutest thing in the world. I was mistaken. 
That's awesome 
I’ve watched one hundred times.
I want to hug her so bad :,)
best thing ive seen all day :)
I had the exact same reaction just watching it. How sweet 😊
I just got goosebumps, so much amazing!
Please reverse it.
As a server, this made me tear up.
She's so damn wholesome I wanna give her a hugg
She is a little cinnamon roll♡ 
This video gave me goosebumps for some reason. This lady is beyond adorable
Oh my god that was adorable. 
this warms my heart
Is it r/mademecry or r/mademesmile ??
Okay I just cried a little, this was too pure
This place looks like a nice place to eat
You can just tell she is a humble person!
What a lovely gesture and reaction!!
I’ve noticed how older women are so much more appreciative of the little things...
And now I'm crying. 
Fuck all the niceties, I hope they have some freaky birthday sex.
This is so sweet 
Waitress was going in for the lips for a second there
Well shit i cried within the 8 seconds
This is what life's all about.
Man I gotta call my grandma
Sweet!
What a nice lady 
So sweet 
This is great to see! Maybe one of the first times I’ve see someone truly appreciate this gesture.
Sooooo cuuute!
That is so nice! Great job!
Cherish every moment.
:)
Lovin' the best of humanity!
This made her day I bet!!!! RAK!!!
I would give her all the presents and cake!

Oh why is there never a mirror bot when I need it?
She reminds me of a scene in The Office where Tobey’s little girl asks Phyllis if she’s mother goose!! That scene was adorable!
This is exactly what I needed while studying for 4 exams :D
I need to remind myself at 52 that it’s ok to have joy like this on my birthday. I need to give MYSELF joy too! My son is 14 today and the joy on his face from the gift of black and white skull sheets, a longboard and some goofy tchotchkes is unmeasurable. 
Coming from someone who works in retail:

EVERYONE should be that excited to be given free stuff. The world needs more people like her. <3
Small towns really are the best about this. My grandparents have been going to the same Italian restaurant every Friday night for 20+ years and the owner still has their special table & recognizes me from when I was a toddler
I don’t know why this sweet lady is making me tear up but here I am. I hope she had a good birthday. <3
That is SO. PRECIOUS.
Omg she reminds me of my mom!!! My moms health isn’t well, so this is a reminder I need to give her lots of love.

Eep, I may cry now. 
Ohmygoodness! I bet that hug was so soft and smellnice! 
I send you a Happiest Birthday from me a total stranger.   I have stolen several relatives from other people,  you are the latest.  I have  no relatives left , stealing them is my way of getting new ones & only the best.  You are a lovely lady.  Eat your cake & others for years to come.  You are now my "Auntie!"   See you next year.
They got her a gift too?!! Jesus Christ how sweet are those waitresses? 
True graciousness. What a sweetheart!!
Looks like the lady who constantly complains but the restaurant has a good heart so they gave her a gift 
I miss my mom. 
That is the sweetest thing iv ever seen. So genuine 
These regulars.  This is why I absolutely love my job. 
That looks like a very sweet little lady. Reminds me how much I miss my grandma. 
Just beautiful 💕💕💕
She is the cutest! 
She reminds me of the sweet old lady with syphilis on House!
I wanna hug that grandma ;-;
I would give any of my big spending regulars to be able to wait on these two... I’m sure they are a god damned pleasure! 
I don't even know her and I love her. Damn you reddit! 
This is so precious! My heart can't take it!
The genuine joy on her face, oh my goodness 😍 
can she tell me it’s all goin to be okay
Gosh, this gave me a cheery.  I miss my mum \*Wibble 
It costs you so little to be kind. Be kind to someone today!
She might be the cutest thing I have ever seen. 
What are puppies?
Had something similar happen to my husband on his birthday earlier this year. Diner we're semi-regulars at (him even more than me) gave him a cake with ice cream as a surprise when they found out it was his birthday. It wasn't even my birthday, but just seeing someone be so kind to someone they only know through brief encounters at their job absolutely warmed my heart. It's nice to realize there are people out there you don't even realize that care. 
So jealous...would love to have an opportunity to make someone feel that way 🤗
26 year old dude, I can’t! 😭
Damn this is the sweetest thing I have ever seen. 
As you get older, birthdays are a reminder that time is passing. Not all birthdays are happy days. The look on this lady's face is wonderful. She is truly overcome by the kindness expressed by the staff working in the place she is eating. I feel her emotion and understand it. It is a mix of happiness, surprise, gladness and perhaps some pain. I wish her much happiness.
I wish I had the ability to feel happy like that about something. 
I wonder how many people suddenly got an urge to call/see there grandma. I already know mine would ask if I'd eaten anything yet the second I show up.
this is too wholesome.
Oh my. My heart. 
I know that for many people, they absolutely dread social interaction... but for some of us, the interaction with bartenders/servers is the only social interaction we get.
They made her feel so special! That’s some human goodness.
That'll be $10
As a server every restaurant has these precious few who we all care about and are willing to chip in money for birthday gifts. They give reactions like this and then leave a handwritten thank you card. Those regulars make our day despite tip. They are civil to us and treat us like family. Bless that woman and the impact she has had on her servers. She deserves the best. 
I want to give her a hug and talk to her all Sunday afternoon
I want to travel to wherever she is and give her the biggest hug. She looks so touched, bless her.
You can tell she's genuinely happy. Things like this is why I haven't given up on humanity. 

Awww, people being lovely to one another
You just know she's going to smell like biscuits when you hug her.
Omg I love her
r/mademesmile
Like my mom, literally, exactly same reaction. <3
Oh man. This hit me in the soft place. I work in ths hospitality industry, and I've tried to make it a point to stress relationships like this. The problem is the further up you go, the farther you get from it. I miss times like this.
This is the highest upvoted post I have ever seen. And I like that.
I love my mom. I don't tell her it enough... I need to go tell my mom I love her before its too late.

Wow I'm getting teary eyed.
She deserves so many kisses!
The highest upvotes I've seen ever on a post and it's so adorable 
OMG she looks like Muriel from Courage the Cowardly Dog! So cute! 
there's a really terrible storm where Im at right now which scares the hell out of me and honestly this cheered me right up. Thanks a ton
She looks 80 but acts like an 8 year old girl (in the most positive way possible). 
Look at the bitch all jelly in the background... just munching away looking like someone else's happiness is spoiling her appetite. I just got off an eleven hour shift and that lady might be a saint but at this point anything but a smile looks like they want the manager. 
The lady in the very back has the poker face of Wendy Byrde
They are matching! It gets cuter!!!
The best feels makes my heart warm
 :)
She's so cute.. I wish her good health and a long, happy life. 
She‘s the CUTEST! Like a little child who is so happy and carefree. Cuuute. 
Makes me want to call my mom
I love how the fellow diners didn’t frantically pull out their cell phones. 
I love this so much.
Now this is quality customer service - showing appreciation towards the good ones. 
I visited my local coffee shop alone and told them it was my birthday.

The lady behind the counter said 'next please'.

I'll never forget it xx
It’s those damn circular glasses, they’re just too cute.
Made me smile. Ear to ear. 
It was after this that ex leader & commander of Berlins notorious Hitler youth Gertrud hemmel was descovered. She was responsible for the persecution of Jews, LGBT and people of African descent. all thanks to this video
I think the lady in the back lit the candle with her gaze.  
Love to see these things. 
The lady in the background? No one..?
Good people.
The older you get, the less amount of acknowledgment you get on your birthday. That needs to change.
This feels like it’s in Britain... anyone else feel this? :)
What a nice lady
Adorable
it makes me want to cry, it's so sweet
Reminds me of my grandmother who would always make that priceless expression of “Why do I deserve this I’m so thankful”.
The customers in the back: They ain’t shit..🙄
I can’t stop rewatching these eight seconds of pure joy
I want to know her.
Aww my heart is melting!
I’m not crying you are!
That's adorable!
Awe, what a sweetie! Wonderful hearts all around. 😍
Lady in the back MEAN MUGGIN'!!! 
This made me cry 🤧
That's so awesome
Wholesome! 
Awwww she's adorable
I swear i'm not crying
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
What's up with the table of Grumpfaces in the back, jeez 
She's so cute!😭
She is so adorable! Gosh those rosy cheeks are so cute. 
I, a grown male (wannabe)man, cried almost like a child.
MY HEART... ITS IN A PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR
What a beautiful, beautiful woman
aww that’s so cutee
Old people are just too much for my heart 
i love old people 
Haha, that’s cute
I love this stuff. If youre organizing a party pls invite me.
She's so hecking cute!!!
This. Is. So. Cute. 
Who's cutting the onions.
That was heartwarming :,)
Why are my eyes getting sweaty? 
I love this so much! One sweet treat just made this lil ol lady’s day. 
I cried. She’s too cute, I can’t 
Classic grandma
I needed to see this tonight
Kinda reminds me of my Mom. Rip mom
All the feels 
Love the customers reaction, but awesome reaction by the waitress too. Look at the smile on her face being able to give this woman her cake. Pure happiness. 
Awh! I think my heart smiled, this is so pure! Its adorable how excited she was
Aww! I love the animals posted here, but this is definitely my favorite so far. I want to know this sweet lady!
AWWWWW
Omg this warms my heart
I love stuff like this 
Just seeing her reaction teared my eyes up dang
That smile!
This is me whenever someone says anything nice about me
That is officially the cutest couple Ive ever seen. They’re wearing the same shirts! #relationshipgoals
Aw, shucks. Well that's just the sweetest darn thing ever.
I want to bake her all the cakes. 
Sometimes humans do nice things and remind me not to hate them all. 😊
Why is Reddit making me cry again
She looks like a little kid. Too damn cute.
Shes so cute omg
Beautiful gesture!
True r/aww
For the business, as a customer nice to know you care.

For the customer, it's nice to know a business notices you.

This is the type of lady I want to become. Surely she's a very loving person to have made so many friends in life, and she's so appreciative
She looks like a 10/10 grandma. Also for a split second you see her husband who looks like the cutest sweetest old man! 
Is this in Ireland? 
Damn, she reminds me of my grandma. I miss her. 
You restore my faith in humanity! Thank you!
You never know if this was one of the only birthdays someone acknowledged for her. 
No old couple is complete without matching shirts.
Omg my heart!! 
Granny's pilled out
Such a heartwarming gesture!
Wow I didn’t expect to start crying 
That's goddam adorable 
Why can't more of us find the joy in life like this?!
Bless her
r/gifsthatendedtoosoon
Happy birthday to her!
😭😭😭 This is awesome!
Uhm, so, why am I tearing up like this on a Friday night?
Just cried a little
I hope I can make someone this happy one day 
This is so cute 
the title is so itchy. free cake? and this why she is happy? she's happy because they care about her birthday.
That's really sweet.
That lady has to have a dog named Courage.
Making people happy feels better than just about anything... Truth
Right in the feels
For whatever reason I sadly think her kids are assholes. They could be dead, but it just really seems like she "expects" this, just not from these people. Really great video honestly, and makes me want to call my Bestemor.
This is so hecking cute
Sometimes, the smallest gestures are gigantic to those without family or friends. Thanks for sharing this. 
She is genuine, she is great!

Also, this is me everyday of the week working free fake birthday deserts at chain restaurants. 
Aww, my heart. 
This is the cutest!
I want to cry 
This is wonderful!
This made my heart warm!
Every single thing about this screams England
Can life be more of this please? Kthxbye. 🙃
This is so sweet!

One of the only things I miss about being a server were my regulars. A good regular could really improve my mood during a bad shift. 
You can see the little girl she used to be with that expression and arm movement. So adorable!
I’m ugly crying over this 
The little things really do matter 
That is so sweet! 
I love this! She’s so cute!!!!
I don't know how, and I've never said this before in my life, but "heartwarming" is a gross understatement.
Dawwwww I love her!!
This ain’t it chief *sniffles* this ain’t it
What an incredibly beautiful moment
The world is filled with good people
The older woman is adorable, but what is up with the woman in the back staring at the wait staff like she's deciding which one to eat first? 
She’s so cute (:
Beautiful.
So sweet!!
My greatest regret as an adult is not taking the time to get to know my grandfather when he was so adamant on informing me of the Mayan civilization. Please love and appreciate those around you, having a loving family is so special. 
This is so sweet that I need a couple extra hearts to even fathom the cuteness without exploding. 
Damn. I lost my grandma about 4 years ago. I’m strange about mourning death. I don’t necessarily get sad and if I do it doesn’t last long. Granted my grandma and I were not super close but seeing this almost brought tears to my eyes. She looked strikingly similar to this woman and acted in that same mannerism. 
My heart is melting. This is so sweet!
Kneaders?
Can i have her as my grandma?
Scamming people into getting yourself a cake by faking birthday . Trick is sure as old as this grandma.
But does she remember is the 21st of September.
I hated getting sung to at a restaurant, I hated the spotlight. But later on I loved pranking my dates with a fake birthday surprise at restaurants. I guess it was pretty juvenile in retrospect.
Proper, surprise.
Could be wrong, but is this Bob Evans?
The sweetest!
Awwwwww there is still some goodness left in this world!!!! I love it. Every part of it. She is so beautiful! Gargh .... XD
I always loved surprising customers with free pancakes and icing for their birthday. Recently I had a little boy who had his birthday and when I came out with his birthday pancakes, both him and his dad were so happy! It made my night just seeing their smiling faces! 
My heart 😢😢😢
Shout out to the server too, the joy on her face at being able to do something like this makes me smile too :)
r/mademesmile
Welp, time to call grandma and tell her I love her.
Awwwww she is sooooo cute omg
this is so insanely adorable
I love that I went into the controversial section of the comments and I found no negative comments about this sweet little lady. I would upvote twice if I could.
r/humansbeingbros
Damn. I want a hug
Grandma poppin that collar! 
She looks like what Queen Elizabeth would have looked like if she grew up middle class in South Carolina
That's so sweet! 
I love old people. Yes, even the mean ones.

I'm 32 and I had a client at my work named Henry. He was in his late 80s. He was always incredibly firm, abrupt and short when you would talk to him. One time, after knowing him for like 12 years and seeing him multiple times a year (I was his accountant) and never getting more than a few words from him and a glare, I mentioned that I was brewing beer at home. He immediately changed, everything from his posture to the sound of his voice, even his eyes. We talked about beer for maybe 30 minutes. It was fun and it was like talking to a completely different man. He told me about all his favorite beers, what meals he would have with each one, everything. 

He passed a few months after that conversation. I feel like there was so much more that I could've learned about him had I only had the time or maybe said the right few words to get him to open up a few years earlier.
This should get 100000000x up votes and hopefully remind us all that it’s the little things that matter most
This is why you treat everyone you encounter with respect. 
There are people like this, and people who expect free cake on their birthday
I’m not crying you’re crying 
I cried! 
Humans being bros/friends :3 
They look British 
My heart!!! 
Meanwhile death stare from woman near the window. 
She seems absolutely gorgeous. I'm so glad the employees care enough about her to do something for her. 
The people at the table behind her are not impressed.
This put a smile on my face, what a nice surprise 
Aw! Love it!
I'm not crying, you'r crying. 
aaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwww
her energy levels are far from regular!
Awwwwwwwww
Instant love!
Some people simply deserve the world
r/humansbeingbros
Gifs that end too soon...       ??
I’m not crying your crying 
It's the little things people. This is what it's all about
Husband was turning around to see where his cake was 
Goddamnit. It’s just so real and precious. We need SO MUCH MORE of this in today’s world. I literally can’t even. 
Aww the best and the cutest reaction ever. I so wish I could give her that surprise to get that smile on her face.
She doesn't look like the kind of person who wants her face splashed all over the internet. But hey, you get that karma.
GOD BLESS REGULARS 😭💜
Hit me right in the feels
Reminds me of my mom
Too sweet. True happiness. Made me smile.
This is so precious and sweet that it hurts me.
Please does somebody have a source to the vid please
first time going to the popular section and AWWWW
Happy bday ma’am!
Why did I just start crying? 
Oh my gosh 😍 bless her heart! Happy birthday!
I can’t stop watching this. 
was having a shitty day, this made it better. Sweet old lady!
This is so adorable! And she looks genuinely surprised and happy
That’s really sweet. 
I love this post and thread. So wholesome. 
This is nice to see.
This literally warmed my heart, a big o happy birthday to her!! 
Damn it, that's real nice. 
Super cute
Came to post she was adorable but I see someone else already said that. I love her. I could watch this forever!
I'm older than the Reddit crowd but please give your mom, dad and grandparents a call.  If you had that friends that passed give their parents a call.  

It means the world to them.  
Sooo sweeet
warming
This is why a service/hospitality is a real job. There’s few things as rewarding as making someone’s day like this. Tip your servers, people! 

-service industry professional
I miss my grandma
I'm gonna fucking die that's so adorable. I wish her 100 more happy birthdays.
That lady is nicer than I’ll ever be. What an innocent human. 
You all make me belive that life is worth continuing on for...
How sweet and sad at the same time. She's obviously not used to being showed such special attention. She is very precious. Happy Birthday!!!
Gorgeous 
She definitely gives good hugs and smells like cookies.
I almost cried this is too sweet.
Oh no now I’m going to cry, that’s too precious. 
I want to take care of her!!! Now!!!! :(

Hope she has a family that loves her and treats her well!! ;___;
 Aww I want to give her a hug, she is so sweet!
She is so cute. :)
i'm gonna cry
There still is good in this world and people who deserve it—thank you!
Amazing how just by looking at her body language we can know exactly how happy she is
Love.
Mah heart. Mah souuuullll. 









This legitimately makes me cry though 
I need a subreddit for videos like this where you see the inner kid. This video, there was that video a while back where an older woman was given a new stove, dad gets a puppy...

all those videos where it makes no difference whether the person is 5 or 85, the reactions are the same.
Aww this video makes me smile. :)
Wow she seems pretty happy, you can expect at least a 5% percent tip this time!
MY HEART OMG
A little cake and love can go long way
Very cute. She has this kinda Howls moving castle Witch of the waste look about her. 
That is so nice
If she was an aunt of mine I'd visit her everyday
This is way too sweet :) I hope she had a wonderful birthday!
I cannot hear anything— Is it just me? 
this brightened my day. thanks for sharing. 
I've worked in restaurants for years, and its moments like these, and customers like her, that make it bearable. Too often the restaurant industry shows the worst in mankind, but there are always those people out there that are simply wonderful.
The only person who doesn't hate restaurant staff singing happy birthday
I want her to hug me.
This makes me miss my mom. She hasn't passed away but has moved out of state.
This makes me happy
You can tell the waitress really loves her, too, and the little Yiayia goes in for a hug right away, gahhh I love this so much I can’t deal with it.
I’m not crying, you’re crying! 
Sticking cameras in their faces negates these acts 
Sweet but kind of sad!  I hope her family comes to spend time with her on her birthday.
I paused it at the perfect time. https://imgur.com/oHV6cN9

Awe so sweet
This reminds me of me mum.
Fella's just looking back to see if he gets a piece too.
That is the exact same face my mother is excited to the point of overwhelmed about something
This is so wholesome!
we as younger people always take/took it for granted. well, at least i did. she probably hasn't had anyone make a big deal about her birthday in years. you can tell by her reaction. what a sweetheart.
Wish someone did this for me on my cake day :(
I love people like this. 
So there is some faith in humanity
How couldn’t this make anyone happy
Please leave us a big tip.
I’m just trolling. This is fucking adorable!
I like her
I love this. 
Awwwww! Just a real person in a real moment of her own real life! So sweet! 
So sweet
I can't up vote this enough. She's too cuuuuuute. 
Ok done. Now let’s hit the next joint for free cake!
Why am I crying? 
I literally shed a tear so stinkin cute 
The free cake was worth it. 
Sometimes getting a present isn't about how much big and expensive it is, but the gesture
Bless her angel heart! 
She’s my favorite person of the day.

Her husband takes second place for his clear confusion.
Is this in England?
This has gone so wholesome... thanks all, sometimes I feel silly cause I got so much feels.  Nice to know I'm not alone. 
This restored some of my faith in humanity 
God that's so wholesome I could die.
Oh my gosh old people are my favorite 
Love her! 
That woman at the very back seems like she's grimacing.
This is the most heartwarming thing I’ve seen all year; I must hug that woman. 
I wish everyone I bought dessert to reacted like this... but then again not because I would probably cry!
That's pretty sweet.
My heart just melted!
Welp I cried.
I want a hug!!
Little shit like this sticks with people
It’s amazing how such little things can often mean so much to others. 
not me.....I see that comming I'm out the back door
r/adorableoldpeople
Where’s my cake?
Does anyone have a source by chance?
I just want to put her in my pocket.
Good God this makes me so damn happy.
That is just the sweetest old lady!
Hehe the little apology at the end is too cute 
Aww, everyone is so happy!
I gotta say when my day just ends up being the usual malaise of depression and sadness, I can always come here for a little "pick-me-up"! The smile on her face and the overall love in this video just makes the world seem brighter. To anyone out there feeling a little down: I love you and I hope things get better! 
That's what makes us humans after all
"Teeheehee, its not even my birthday"
ITS.......SO......WHOLESOME
Bad ass
Little acts of kindness is what we are missing?  (Without a narcissistic, monetary reason, judgmental,  self-centered reason.)
Sweet grandma 💜💜💜💜
This is the cutest grandma I have ever seen 
Aw! This warmed my heart. So sweet. 
She's not my grandma, but...Happy Birthday! I love you grandma
 I can see the little girl  come out of her.
I’m crying 
This is precious 😍
😭😭
Pure innocence warms your heart 
Omfg I love her so much
The people in the back are [not impressed](https://imgur.com/gallery/s2oTmb0)
How sweet!!
Do greay
THATS SO CUTE
She appreciates the “Happy Birthday” more than the cake.
Old people like the simple things. My grandma just likes to leave the house. 
Yeah, but to be fair, she knows these people. This isn't the situation the posts have been talking about. 20 servers stampeding to your table and singing some shitty birthday song knockoff is a different situation. 
I could probably watch this forever...
She reminds me of my mom. My mom would have the same reaction. 
I hope she had a good birthday
This reminds me of my Nana... She was a regular everywhere. Thanks for posting. 
Nothing gets me more than a good customer service story. 
Sometimes it’s just nice to be thought of and feel appreciated 
Much better than a group of idiots coming out to sing happy birthday.   Cringe to the max
Oh my god, both her AND her (?)husband are so freakin' cute and make me wish I could adopt them as grandparents.
#MY FEELERS
I'm not crying. You're crying! 
I got free ice cream on my birthday today.
Ccutteee
Happy cake day! 🍰 
She seems sweet but I do believe it's just an ability to act out your emotions effectively. 

I don't always express my body language effectively or appropriately and therefore I believe I can be misunderstood. 
As a long time server, regulars are what make our jobs worthwhile. She reminds me of a few of my own. 
I am sobbing profusely
Definitely a british reaction
I love her and I hope her birthday was magical 
my heart is melting. damn you grandma for being so adorable!
The world needs much more of this on social media! 
Anyone else want to give that lady a nice 1-2min hug... she seems like such a sweet woman. 
Aw, I wish her all the best 
Awe, you can tell she’s an extremely nice woman. She looks so grateful that they are giving her cake and a gift. 

Good on you restaurant workers, the little things can mean so much to people and it shows right here. 
This so cute I’m kinda crying and I have a beard we normally don’t do that
I've never cried at a Reddit post, but fuck this just did it. 
She is adorable 😍
This makes my heart happy 
I’m 39  a yo man,now on a train.
I’m having tears watching this.

She is darling. What a pure human bean
Omg so cute!
It's not her birthday, she just wanted a free coffee 38 years ago and it's too late to back out now
Cake.
I love this, she fully embraced it. Whereas if this happened to me in a restaurant, I would be cringing with embarrassment.

I need to lighten up! 
What the world needs now... is love sweet love
Love your neighbors. Just like this 
Very cool 
We can all do this for someone 
This is so pure. 
Sometimes it takes so little to make someone happy.
I love this. 
This is me when I get free anything
This feels like the response of someone who doesn't receive this sort of affection much anymore. Here's to hoping I am wrong.
Everyone deserves to feel special on their birthday.
God I feel like such an asshole avoiding elderly people, the ones I encounter at my work place are usually horrible so it makes it difficult. Her reaction makes her seem like an angel compared to them. BRAVO TO THAT RESTAURANT YALL GOT ME CHOKED UP AND SHIT
This is the sort of thing that can cause me, a grown man, to break down. People don't realize how much a simple act of kindness can mean to someone. You can see it in this woman's eyes what this meant to her. I'll never know this woman, but her joy is infectious. This is purely wholesome. Thank you, OP.
If it went on any longer it would have landed on r/mademecry
Awww so adorable
This made me smile!

She deserves it. How sweet!
Cake Day!!
That’s so sweet!!! Look at that lady mean mugging in the background. 😂 She’s like I want some damn cake too. 
Please hug me. 
Have no idea when this was taken but it’s my birthday today. I’m so happy to “share” this day with such a cute lady! I hope she felt just as loved and blessed as I felt today. 
I know this comment will get buried but this gif made me so happy. Her genuine joy and gratefulness reminds me of my late grandma. I forgot how much I missed her but this short clip was able reminded me of the all the good times we had
She was really touched & surprised. It was genuine. It was appreciated
I want to hug this sweet lady!
God Bless Them
Heartwarming indeed.
Oh God, I'm too drunk for this :')
that looks like someone who has been having hard times and just needed to feel appreciated. thank you young ladies!

This is the cutest video I’ve ever seen in my life thus far :) she is so happy!
I'm sitting here eating fried hot dogs with Charley and I come across this video.  Good stuff for me ...
Everyone deserves kindness and love
AWWWW
Oh my god I want to give her a free cake every day
This made me cry. I used up waitress and we had some elderly regulars that definitely came in to loved and treated like family. We’d chat with them, hug them, and take pictures with them. When you get shit on by customers and are feeling down you really look forward to your regulars that help you remember you are good at your job and you make a difference to people (and they make a difference to you too.)
It's so beautiful & sweet. I'm sitting here teary eyed!
Im hard if hearing and lip read. Pretty sure she says “dont cry” as she wipes away her tears. 😭
This made my day
Aww ❤️ In the service industry, there are certain people who come along and make it worth it. She must be so genuinely kind for them to do that for her.
