Peachick (that‚Äôs actually what they‚Äôre called). So cute.
He really thinks he's hot shit, with all 6 feathers
Everybody goes through the awkward phase during puberty. That‚Äôs comforting.
LOOK AT MY MAGNIFICENT FEATHERS!
Idk why. I have never seen a baby peacock, but this makes me think they are the "toddlers and tiaras" of birds. 

Maybe because the fluffy butt feathers remind me of the short, super ruffled dresses they wear a lot of the time.
It looks like a Chocobo!
That's not JUST a baby peacock, that's a baby peacock pending/practicing showing off his tail feathers, even though he won't have his beautiful array until adulthood- which takes a couple years.
They‚Äôre so front-heavy without their tail feathers!
He's got 6 tail feathers and he's rocking every single one of them.
Amazing I need 100
Lil guy flexing like big pops already. Love it
im high and this looks like if a baby deer was a bird
God if I could have that kind of confidence!
I'm a peacock! You gotta let me fly!
Birb
That is 100%, a fucking dinosaur.
Where I live it‚Äôs normal to have peacocks roaming around in zoos without boundaries. They often have babies, too. Isn‚Äôt it like that everywhere? 
PS: I‚Äôm European
When I drove for UPS in the last century. There was a lady that had a huge yard (like 6 acres of front yard) and she had peacocks and there were like 5 chicks running around one afternoon.  They‚Äôre so damn cute.
OMG! A baby Chocabo!
Oh my god. It‚Äôs like a duck turkey baby chick
Those big eyes though! Are those the special eyeliner feathers?
you can finally get Knights of the round summon
I‚Äôm in love! ‚ù§Ô∏è
That's a Chocobo
u/SpaceTMerlin I've never seen a baby one!
Thing has confidence
it's a chocobo!!!!
It might not be a boy. The girls will do that sometimes too.
Looks like a spider turkey.

And not in a good way
Baby rave turkey!!!
*Proud baby noises*
Huh... Now I'm wondering what a baby pelican looks like. 

Jesus. What does a baby pelican look like?
Was not expecting that 10/10 not disappointed!
Never seen one either and that‚Äôs too cute!
#CAW CAW CAW
They have great postures

Must do face pulls
I thought they appeared instantaneously fully grown out of the ground. Learned something new today.
That's obviously a brown chocobo.
This reminds me of how I felt about boys in general in grade school. They were strutting already but it just wasn't. . .quite. . .right?
I would like one, please
How sweet.
And they say dinosaurs are extinct, pffft...
Do they sound like crying adults?
Met gala turkey!!
aww
My god that‚Äôs cute
Omgggggg
Pre-glory stage
Aaaaaaaaaaaaand my brain just exploded into candy.
Looks like a mini turkey
He‚Äôs trying SO HARD.
Looks like a small turkey
Look at him practicing so hard. What a lad. 10/10
Just getting started learning to control his ass cheeks.
I want a pet baseball glove too. Where can I get one
I‚Äôm not sure how to get one, but I want one
He‚Äôs struttin‚Äô his stuff the best he can & it‚Äôs adorable as heck.
Look at that strut!
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt walk, I strut.‚Äù
Great things start from small beginnings
Popcorn chicken
My sister had one once that she rescued. The thing absolutely LOVED to play in your hair. It would peck at it and stick its head in and everything.
He has the confidence of an average heterosexual man
u/Alyes21 buongiorno
What sort of turkey is that?
They are so gorgeous but they are loud just in case you want one and enjoy sleep
Video didn't even load and I already upvoted
Why are you filming that underage chicks bare butt?
I Just realized, I‚Äôve never seen a baby peacock before
It's a chocobo
That is a chocobo
"Omg look at that butt" Nicky Minaj probably. üòÜ
I maybe be mistaken, but is that thing‚Äôs asshole taller than it‚Äôs eyes depending where the neck is??? This is important.
Lil dude's gotta get those reps in before the big moment arrives
A female right? I wonder what a baby male looks like
I dont know what I thought they looked like, but it wasnt this.
That‚Äôs adorable!
Look at those fuzzy little butt feathers!
That is hideously adorable
"Look at my fluffy butt. I said look at it!"
Sphere chicken
Look at my butt!
I thought baby swans were my fave baby bird but this guy wins
Adorable
So kind of like a turkey then
When ever I see a peacock I just think of their loud as hell scream, lol.
This bakugan live action movie is gonna be wild
That's a fucking dinosaur
A peapee
He is doing his very best!
IM STUNNING ! KNEAL BEFORE YOUR KING!
As cute as a baby goat
Just like a baby flamingo, imitating its older self!
Look at him so proud of his strut! üòç
That's precious.
Looks like a Chocobo, I'm a nurture it and then race it.
Reminds me of a quail chick but extra ornamentation
That's a Chocobo
Ugly little bastard don't care.  "Fuck you, I'm beautiful as hell" while displaying half a dozen shaggy feathers lol
Thought you had a mini chocobo for a second.
This resolution disappoints.
Looks like an in unevolved version of The bird Pok√©mon with 3 heads. Lol.
Is this a female or male chickpea?
Peachicks!! Omaha‚Äôs zoo has peacocks that roam free and whenever their mating season is you can sometimes see a mom and all her little babies cross the paths as you walk around. They‚Äôre so adorable
This little guy looks like he could be a young turkey tom. Turkeys have this strut
Aye, what a cute Weecock!
It looks like a mini chocobo from final fantasy.
Life before the baggage
I legitimately smiled at the stupid little waddle
So majestic.
He looks like he doesn't know what to do with his hands (wings).
Looks like a baby turkey but he hit puberty in the first two weeks
Why is it that literally any and every kind of baby animal is so much cuter than a human baby could ever be. Compared to this they're just miniature  bibendum's that just shit scream and puke. Just .. how
these things are expensive as heck. i need so breed some. it could be like printing money.
Beautiful bird but my auntie has 3 of them & they are the noisiest bastards you‚Äôve ever heard. Mean SOBs too! No doubt though gorgeous to behold.
Hello yes I'd like to purchase 7
They are hilarious little birbs
That is a Chocobo.
Dat ass
Aww he looks like a pine cone
Chochobos from Final Fantasy!
Looks like a chocobo.
I'm pretty sure that's called a pea-winky
How tall is it
First time in 30 years I've seen a baby one. I assumed the matrix just made them appear as adult. Glad the care taker added them.
Eso ta feo.
Anyone else imagining adorable turkey/peacock version of the ugly duckling?
Cute.
peachick ü§ó
He's got the right attitude already.
Looking like a scoliosis chicken.
Fancy turkey
Needs to fly with a little man on top with a lance and some flying gators!
This made my night.  Adorable!
it looks like a baby lyrebird
Just adorable little feller
That is cute!!
Chocobo!
There‚Äôs only one thing to do in a time like this...

STRUT
Chocobo
George Carlin: What do you call a female peacock?  A peacunt.
Where‚Äôs his mom?üòÇ
They look cute until you're in the zoo as a child just trying to have fun, and the baby peacock keeps following you around, then the mom peacock gets pissed and attacks you and chases you around the zoo, traumatizing you and leaving you scared of peacocks forever.

Not speaking from personal experience or anything.
He sure walks with confidence. Peacocks are a sore subject for me. Our local zoo let them roam free throughout the grounds. I don't know how many times I saw one with it's tail feathers fanned out, strutting it's stuff. Most of the time, they just laid around in the shade. Generations of people took their kids to the zoo and walked the grounds with the peacocks always around. They always kept their distance though. I think I read they had roamed the grounds for over 50 years. That was, until some kid chased one down and managed to catch it. It scratched the hell out of him and got away. There was a big stink about it and the almighty powers decided the peacocks had to go.
And my name shall be... Disheveled
R/divorced birds
I live in Denver and enjoy going to the Denver zoo. We let the peacocks run wild. I've seen many many peacocks... This is my first baby peacock and it's adorable.
He‚Äôs like mutha fucker, wait till I blossom bitch!
So cute and guaranteed to grow up to be a jerk. Great guard animals.
Brought one in last year (from the dozens around my property) then felt bad about it being indoors so I took it back outside hoping another hen would foster it. Well she did, but foster you‚Äôd see on crime tv. Won‚Äôt try to intervene with Mother Nature no mo.
They are cute, and quite beautiful, until your neighbor has one that roams the streets making noise at odd hours of the day.
That‚Äôs a fuzzy butt
My wife just found this and has been crying for 10 minutes now
Not gonna lie, I think they look better as chicks. Such a majestic baby.
Not quite classy, still a little trashy :P
Thanks, I love it.
What confidence
Tbh that‚Äôs a complete disappointment haha.
Looks like Hay hay from Moana lmao
Baby animals always win. Always.
F A N C Y   F L O O F   D U C K
LOOK AT MY BUTT
They can also fly.
Thats a blooming onion before they fry it.
Any baby is precious.
looks like a haggard mini-turkey
whats wrong with your dinosaur?
Soooo a turkey?
It‚Äôs proud.
So question, is this a peahen? Since the colours are brown and boring, or do the colours come in as they mature?
It looks like a cartoon chicken that was kicked in the butt
I want one
Peachick
Look at him showing off!
OMG that‚Äôs precious!!
Looks like a baby chocobo
Who‚Äôs that Pok√©mon!
Is this where the idea for a ‚ÄúChocobo‚Äù came from?
He looks like he is desperately trying to cover his ass, so cute
You've clearly not played Planet Zoo, they're the spawn of Satan I tell ya
Is that it‚Äôs butthole moving? Ew!
For a sec I thought I was looking at a badly photoshopped deer
We rarely see them because they were kidnapped at birth by humans and genetically altered to look like peacock, nature dont make peacocks. Its a global cockspiracy.
"You can't keep me couped up in here! I'm a peacock... You gotta let me fly!"
I kinda' love that they have their mannerisms from birth, haha already strutting around without all the feathers, it's so adorable.
This is the cutest thing
Girls at the club be like
Looks like a turkey chicken hybrid
HE LOOKS LIKE AN AWKWARD SCHOOL KID TRYING TO APPROACH THE GIRL HE LIKES ü•∫üôä
Much cuter than a baby seagull.
It looks like a miniature turkey
I need more baby peacocks
THAT FUZZY BUTT
He's trying his best.
YOUNG LADY YOU ARE NOT LEAVING THE HOUSE DRESSED LIKE THAT.
It's like a chicken with üéá*flair*üéá
Is there a single animal, whose baby doesn't look cute?
someone unveil a baby pigeon!
Already flexing!
Hey ugly duckling, your gonna be prettier than a swan.
Awwww! ü•∞ü•∞
Think more.

Bot.
That's weird and I love it
I have a peacock at work that I call boyfriend because every time he sees me he starts showing off his baby feathers. Peafowl are fucking great.
We had a dozen peacocks on our six acres of land. They somehow found the one drainage hole, and just sat there everyday shitting into it. Two were killed in tropical storm Allison when some chicken wire smothered them, probably our fault didn't expect a tropical storm a week after getting them, three were eaten by an alligator in our pond a few months later, no idea how the alligator got in, the pond was like 5ft by 7ft, the rest we gave away because they kept clogging the one drain in six acres with their crap. Peacocks, they shit a lot. It smells. Clogs drains. Probably applies to all birds. I don't want to discount the drainage aspect, we had a hole for our land, six inches wide, thats where the fuckers pooped, and it fucked shit up. Good on them for finding drainage, its just we had six acres elsewhere you could poop, you fuckers.
The ancestors of birds and mammals separated a LONG time ago, so it's kind of strange that we find baby birds to be cute.
Like a turkey wearing a diaper
So a turkey
What? It's a mini ostrich
So how do you get this Pok√©mon to evolve?
Booooooring
I'm loving this thread simply because I ***REALLY*** hope someone thinks they look cute and will get one, and a few years down the line will realise they probably made the biggest mistake of their entire lives, and end up being hated by everyone and never ever get to have guests round.

Go on, buy a peacock, they look really pretty! Muahahahaha...
Ass? Out. Feathers? Fluffed. Ladies? Swoonin‚Äô
Looks like a dudrio with 1 head.
BABY CHOCOBO
this is flexing! knowing your worth even your small is a good thing, he knows that starting small and becoming what you are in the future is the right mind set. we should admire this baby peacock and have a reason for ourselves be proud of what we are right now that some day we will be gold at the eyes of others
This Little Guy is much more Motivating then any other Mainstream Motivational Speakers.
Holy fuck! I've literally never thought about a baby peacock. But yet, I instantly knew I've never thought about this...
Talk about ugly duckling
That‚Äôs pretty neat thanks for sharing!
Wtf are you saying. They look like chicken having a bad feather day
Just realized peacocks are basically turkeys, just fabulous
[Needs audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wx9hjDLX_FE)
It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre walking around in a big fluffy dress
4-3-8-9-5
Awww, he‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a big boy now!‚Äù :D
This is adorable üòç
Oh God some years back one of our neighbors got heavily into peacocks, their property was right next to and lived right by the highway and the peacocks would wander out and flock onto the highway and commonly get blasted by cars and blown to smithereens.
Fucking dinosaurs.
It looks likes a raptor from my nightmares
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen. Absolutely heart-melting
Carry yourself with the confidence of a baby peacock
Little known fact: a female peacock is called a peacunt. Seriously, google it.
So they look like a bird that already got runned over and then dried in the sun.
Chocobo
Looks like a baby chocobo
What level do they evolve?
Looks like a smol turkey
I'm getting tired of Pokemons...
Little fucker is fly as hell üòéü§òüèª
Looks like a baby turkey that survived a tornado it‚Äôs perfect
OMG. So precious! I've never seen one before. I'm in awe.
When i was a kid,a bunch of peacocks frequently used to come to our balcony (to eat or play).

And they just danced spreading their wings while raining. The most amazing thing to ever happen to me.
Oh you poor bastard. Have fun with all those feathers, it's gonna be a tough go!
That baby peacock is precious
Haha sweet ‚ò∫
This reminds me of when kittens crab walk at you, thinking that they are all terrifying and you are just like "Aww... you're a little ridiculous, and cute, but ridiculous".
Kind of looks like a chocobo and a turkey mixed in one. Still cute though.
Look at my ass. LOOK AT MY ASS
Aw. What a cutie. Strurting like he's going a full set of feathers.
kitten!
I live next to an estate with a large peacock population, gorgeous to look at when they fully mature but man can they get loud, really loud especially in the spring and early morning and fairly destructive.  

We've had them on our roof (males like to roost) running up and down the length of the house, first time it happened thought it was another earthquake they did crack some of the tiles.  

Last year one of them got down by the pool and pecked every single inflatable toy, (we assume) he thought they were a threat which I can assure you they were not.
That looks like a sick pigeon
my gf tattoo‚Äôd a peacock on her ass and she always gets mad when I request sex by saying ‚Äúlet me make the bird flap‚Äù but I literally can‚Äôt help myself, sometimes it kills the mood and causes an argument but there‚Äôs some immaturity i‚Äôm not willing to give up.
Bless.
Woah, that catcher's mitt looks like a bird!
Aww it's like a reindeer chicken!
Kinda looks like a shrinky-dink turkey
I like how adult males show off and are like LOOK AT MY WINGSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
Cotton butt
Honestly he‚Äôs just as flamboyant as grown peacocks in my opinion
That motherfucker just showed us all his butthole and was loud about it.
bro those vert feathers looks so uncomfortable 

accidentally roll over when asleep *snap* oop there goes ur looks 

what a nuisance
That‚Äôs a damn turkey!
I always wanted a peacock
It's like a dust bunny with a face.
Looks like a meal
I think they should be called pealings
Very grand and confident even when playing majestic tail feathers that aren't there
Dayum that's cute.
OOOH, So yer a tough guy huh?? Get outa here kid, come back when those tail feathers come in.
Thanks, needed this
My French tickler is bigger than him.
Awwww! He looks like a baby turkey!!
And a part  of Miami is trying to relocate these animals... https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/coconut-grove/article240284516.html
Now a baby peahen. Hey, equality!
Let me show you the dance of my featherlings
Like a baby emu with its butt blown apart and giant ass wings.
Just as arrogant as his parents :)
It‚Äôs a chickpea
An amusement park local to Utah (called Lagoon) has a bunch of adults and babies that just roam the park. They're pretty friendly too
Peacocks and Tiaras
Sooo basically they look like tiny angels sent straight from heaven to warm our cold hearts. Bc yep.

Mini Turkey
"I don't wanna subscribe to watch them grow!" </markiplier>
Baby turkeys [strut too](https://youtu.be/ZCSr8-WUZM0)
Is it fuckable?
I used to keep turkeys and they are just like this as well
Honestly? I‚Äôm kinda disappointed. They‚Äôre so magnificent when they‚Äôre grown. This lil thing looks all ratty and unimpressive compared to the adults lol
So cute!

Edit: just sayin
He's a proud little tiny unit
He's got that *swag*
This is great. 

On an unrelated note, everyone reading this just lost the game.
I hear they taste like chicken
The only thing I know about peacocks is that they breed fast as balls in Zoo Tycoon 2.
Tiny fluffy turkey.
oh. my. stars. Bb so ~√´lƒóg√¢≈Ñt~
That confidence tho..
It's a peachick  currently :p
But is it loud af and a neighborhood pest like the wild peacocks of Southern California?
It looks as hopeful and broken as my confidence actually feels
What a fuckin weird chicken
Pitter patter
Hey there little feather kid...I can see your butt from here!
Tiny treasure
That is a dinosaur!
It reminds me of the hen-hens from slime rancher!
Absotootly  adoraful
This is fake.  Everybody knows birds aren't real.
Cute now, but they're real bastards when they get older
Someone in our city has a flock of them so I've seen them throughout their life cycle. Their mating call is crazy loud and it's insane how high they can jump given how awkward they are with the full rack of feathers. Usually find them on rooftops
These designs are getting more and more intricate
Look at that confident little strut!
Chocobo
What a handsome boy!
There are about a dozen peacocks at the state park near my house, and every year around this time the little pea chicks start popping up and mimicking their daddos. Pretty funny
"Okay, so, you gonna come quiet-like, or duz I have to rough you up?"
Look at him and his dreams beauty
Baby chocobo
Fake, that's a ü¶É Chick!!
And this lil plane looking fellow will grow to be a majestic colorful creature
Awww. A baby fancy turkey. 

I'm kidding!
Confused turkey
Very Pokemon
Already strutting his stuff!
Fuck peacocks bruh
God dammit my heart hurts. It‚Äôs a Turkencock
This is the equivalent to having bad hair
Just wait until it grows up and begins to scream :)
Oh my gawd! Soooo cute!!
Now THAT is adorable
Thats the cutest thing ive ever seen
looks like a chillaxed turkey
Chocobo is real
Mister Fuzzbuttock
I saw a mom peacock carrying her babies on her back climbing a tree while screeching like a wounded cat one time
Whose down to co parent a baby peacock?? Asking for a friend
That sums up the way I look every morning
When I was young, I used to think the showy peacock was just a girly thing that a female peacock do.  Well, later I learnt that only the male are blessed with the showy feather.  All female peacocks are actually in the more subdued brown feather.  I was totally re-educated regarding the right to aesthetic appeal.üòÇ
Lol. Sweet little dude.
I think his name is Lil Player...
But I love him ü•∫
Awe what an ugly duckling
They didn't?
In a place i used to live there was a playground with peacocks living around it. One peahen had four or five chicks that liked to ride on her back. Another peahen kept trying to steal the chicks and make them ride in HER back instead.
*preening intensifies*
I strut, I strut, look at my fluffy butt. Whassup?
It looks like it is burdened by its own physique.
Those little guys are everywhere in my neighborhood! I get to see them grow up and get their colours ü¶öI‚Äôve almost run over peacocks as often as deer..it‚Äôs pretty weird here
Personally I thought it was a little disappointing compared to an adult one b
Cool
Lil fluffy butt :‚Äô)
Looks like a chocobo.....
A chocobo
That is obviously a baby [hawkstrider](https://i.imgur.com/aI2ObFO.jpg)
That‚Äôs really young for him to be displaying. I‚Äôve had about 6-7 generations of peacocks and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen such a little guy displaying
Peacocks freak me out but this is adorable
hee disappointed me

signed,  
the cat
Peacock is the male, the female is a peahen and, collectively, they're called peafowl.
They have these guys all over the Denver zoo in spring. 

I mean, just walking around.
Fluffbutt üòç

r/birdbutts
Where‚Äôs the Mumma? You‚Äôd be dead meat if she was around ha
I‚Äôve never actually thought of this until now, but, I wasn‚Äôt actually sure if a peafowl could fly. I had to google it. Apparently they can.
Just streching his lil feathers!
Little one is all like "One day I'll be fabulous and you'll bow down before me"
Am I the only one that thinks this needs a repost on /AmITheOnlyOne 
To say they looked like they were shit out vs coming out of an egg. You All realize the term "ugly duckling" didn't just pertain to swans. Most only think they are cute becaue you know what they become. And in reality they become annoying beasts in the woods that crow like an infant being beat. Then if thats not enough when they encounter their reflection in the side of a car they will attack that car repeatedly. The only bird thats worse than a peacock is a Canadian Geese.
I mean... don't they, though?
Impressive
r/dontputyourdickinthat ??
Peacocks are assholes though. I had them growing up and they are not pleasant. They‚Äôre also loud as shit. But yeah the babies are cute

I've got Planet Zoo PTSD. Seeing this fills me with horror.

Look at that fluffy butt
We have free range peacocks here have not seen a baby but we do have a newish peahen.
I play Planet Zoo and whenever I see a peachick now they low-key piss me off because of the sound they make in game. Other players will relate. :')
So the male is peacock and the female is a peahen. Wouldn‚Äôt it be a peachick?
Look at it flex it‚Äôs little feathers, this amount of cuteness should be illegal
It‚Äôs a chocobo
PAVE!
Cute. Ugly as fuck but Cute
had a few in my neighborhood growing up, they make a cool ass call that's not all that awful. Good owners/family tho, ymmv
The real ugly duckling
If only i could see more than just the very large pixels, i would know what a baby peacock looks like.
Look at that fluffy bum!!!!
Ooo dopamine, nice
This lil cutie's gonna be so fabulous when he gets older. He's already partway there

They're all cute until; "EEYYYAAAAHHHHUHH"
Awww how cute!
FUZZYBUTT
wow this is so good
Finally one I can fit in a microwave.
Are the really colourful peacocks born with the pretty feathers, or does it develop overtime?
He‚Äôs so ugly, and he‚Äôs doing his best so hard it‚Äôs adorable :,)
I swear, with all the stabilization software for phone cameras these days, how do some people still manage to record the shakiest videos? Cute peachick though.
Ha damn same ,saw thousand chicks around,in movies/tv but never ever saw peachick till now
Chocobo?
Aww he's trying his best
Bro is still flexing

u/casamello the fuzziness is too much to handle!
Definite looks like a [peafowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_peafowl); but is it a peacock or a peahen?
Looks like a turkey
My baby boy gets the cutest bit of fuzzy hair on the back of his head from lying down when he sleeps, and it's always reminded me of the downy feathers you see on baby chicks. Nope. Adorable baby peacock butt all the way.
Chicobo
So ugly and trying so hard. Very relatable.
I used to have a load of these running around the street my mum lives in. Cute little critters
He looks like a cotton flower omg I'm LOSING it
It‚Äôs funny watching them strut before they get their long tail feathers
I'm in love
Adorable
This, my friends, is a birb.
Very handsome
Here in Austin there‚Äôs a park called Mayfield park that has Peacocks and Peahens that roam about.

Now I dare you to find a baby pigeon!
Little bugger already has the strut and attitude. Love it.
males are peacocks

females are peahens

babies are peachicks
I love finding new things I‚Äôd never think to look up
We have a bunch of wild peacocks roaming around our neighborhood.  It's nice and all, until they start flying on top of your roof in the middle of the night making thumping noises, and screaming at 6am every.single.morning.
So damn cute!.
Tbh, not being rude to peacocks but their baby form is abit disappointing color wise
Lord Shen needed to go through this phase
China eats these
Do you know where I can order either chicks or fertile eggs?
Peacocks/hens/chicks have the best posture.
He‚Äôs pretty sure of himself. Awesome!
Look at this peachick trying to make itself look like a peachonk!
omg what a cute little chick!!
I know it's not but it kinda looks like it's trying to hold its fiery butt from Mexican food or something.
If you've never thought about it then how could they disappoint?
Let‚Äôs go young blood! Step up to the king if you‚Äôre brave enough!
I'm a 41 year old, 6'2" 225lb man, husband for 14 years, and father of two children. This post just made me squeal an audible "Aww", before I was able to compose myself. I've never even considered what a baby peacock looked like, and now I love them. I mean, they're ok...
Looks like a turkey
omg yes!
Omg! So cute!
Bro, that's a Chocobo.
Looks like a sassy chicken
Fuck them screaming bastards
I only wish it were real. üò©
Awww...look at its whittle butt...
Tis not a peacock this here be a Pheonix born again from it's own fiery ashes!
"I am tiny but GLAMOROUS!"
That's a pehen? Peacocks are the the blue and beautiful ones. Their female counterparts are brown and ugly.
