LOVE her head rolls like “who wants to pet me? You get to pet me! YOU get to pet me!”
Naw, your girl stole everyone else.
https://i.imgur.com/LgcGIe5.jpg It’s like a better version of that meme template lol
To be fair, she's pretty fuggin' adorable.
Fuck tinder....walk around NYC with a Corgi on my back
I see this is from “the before times”

Tbh I really miss being able to pet dogs
I have a sneaky picture of you + your dog on my phone. LOL  


Edit: *oh no. I've made a huge mistake. I am SO sorry.*  
First off, I never expected this to blow up. 

I casually commented on my lunch break with the full, genuine belief that I still had the picture on my phone. You see, I used to take sneaky photos of adorable animals on the subway to pass the time. It was like this dumb game I played with myself since I was commuting on the 1 train from 181st to Columbus circle, so I had a lot of time on my hands.

Unfortunately, and this is *genuinely* embarrassing to admit (I may have cried over it?), but I don't have the picture anymore as it also contained my ex. 

Thank you previous me for angry deleting every photo I had that included him. /s

In a shit attempt to appease the crowd, I *can* provide, in its place, [a photo of another dog](https://imgur.com/a/kgAZiF8)... in a backpack... on the subway. I can only hope that this is sufficient enough to reduce the tiniest bit of backlash. Regardless, for everyone that will be angry with me, I assure you I'm more angry myself. Ugh.

0/10 never again.
Living her best life
I love the "Distracted girlfriend (then couple) meme" at 0:18!
Hey this is my dog Maxine.  We want to thank r/aww and the entire Reddit community for all the support over the years.  This week Maxine was nominated for a Webby Award for best animal on social - which is crazy in and of itself. But if you have a moment to please vote for Maxine (Mad Max Fluffy Road)! She really wants to win. Please and thank you.

If you're single, dogs make a great wingman. It's a good way to start a conversation with a stranger. That's how I met my wife.
Aliens observing us have got to be FASCINATED by our emotional infatuation with dogs. 

They are everywhere in our daily lives and yet we always lose our shit when we see a cute one in our vicinity, it's like Christmas came early.
That dude who grabs his girlfriend's arm like she's about to run for the dog
Ah the carefree pre-pandemic years of going up and giving scritches and snuggles to people’s pets. I hope we get back to this soon.

I love that for the most part it’s younger women, and then you get a bunch of big buff dudes squealing about the puppy. 

I love your dog.
Reason #347 why I am determined to become a talking dog as soon as it is technologically possible
Cutest dog ever I’m obsessed
Such a sweet face.
This does put smile on my face.

God DAMN this is cute!
Pre covid wholesomeness
I feel like dogs are doing a lot of the heavy lifting toward getting us all through the last year or so.
Brought me to tears - Lost my girl of 13 years (a chocolate lab named Leia) just a couple weeks ago, and this reminded me of how sweet and friendly she was, too! Keep your wonderful girl safe!
Is Maxine sad without pets due to covid? 😢
This is the cuteness i needed today thx
This is life before covid.
I would not want to steal her, but I for sure would give her a headpat :)
Is that the famous Mad Max Fluffy Road? Beautiful!
Corgs are THE BEST
I want to do this too!  
But I have no one to carry me in a backpack.
[This could be a meme](https://i.imgur.com/OqRBb56.jpg)
I have to put my puppers down next week due to cancer starting to eat away at her QoL. 13 amazing years. This was hard to watch but it also reminded me of the good times. Love your pupper tonight, the time flies.
I did this with my rottweiler in a huge ass bag on the subway. [Like this but with a zipper at the top.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a0/60/e9/a060e9486689a7e22e384ae3ecc09e37.jpg) It was fun, and while I'm sure he was a bit uncomfortable he definitely loved having everybody pet him.
Think you just discovered a more efficient dating app.
Dogs are fucking magic, man. Look at all the happiness she brings just by existing. I bet she made so many people's day and reduced a lot of stress.
I miss pre Covid times
Icebreaker skill +100
Its hard when you're in love with a beautiful woman. Everybody loves her! Everybody wants her!

Now go and get the pair of you a nice mug of Hot Chocolate..
“And that kids is how I meant your mother”
Dogs really do bring people together. And that's a fact.
Not gonna lie, I’d be one of these basics tryna patpat her head too.  

I am most def a basic out in the real world who does this to *every. single. doggo. I. see.*
Is that puppy aware of the huge quantities of happiness she generates by simply existing?
19 second mark as me LOLing
Good people love dogs and want to pet them.
Man humans sure do love them some doggos. Myself included!
I adore the fact that total strangers will kiss a dog, because they just can’t help it.
I love all the genuine smiles on everyone's face.
I'm wondering if I can pet the owner aswel.
Good lord the music is fucking awful.
Hey what backpack is that?? I want 1 for my potato 🥔
Ohhh is make an attempt but he would not leave you because he is LOYAL to his papa 🥰🐶💙
How do you know when he has to poo a little whine?
This dog is adorable. But am I the only one here that gets annoyed when random strangers come up to me just to pet my dog? Like don’t touch my dog without permission. Boundaries people
This is a wonderful video for humanity and anti-racism. I love all the different people with all the same reactions. Seriously, this should be a psa. Really really wonderful.
doggie gettin all the ladies
Goes to show how much a dog can improve your mental health.
This sweet girl makes everyone’s day better!!
People taking pictures of every thing seems odd to me
What breed is she?
I miss my dog :(
Perfect "distracted boyfriend" at 0:19 :D
This is so fucking sickly sugary sweet.... I am so envious.... TAKE MY UPVOTE! :D
That dog is getting more girls than I can
That guy at 0:19 grabs his girl like, "Not again!" Then plays it off with a laugh
So much genuine happiness. Thanks for sharing this.
Someone knows exactly what they are doing in life!!
the reaction from the two dudes at 0:07 are my favorite. It's just that big loud laugh of joy.
I should get a dog
Dogs arw definitely great wingmen... they are a chick magnet lol
I have gone my whole life without kissing any random stranger's dog (no matter how cute), this is really bizarre to see.
That’s madmax_fluffyroad from IG post some excellent wholesome content
How do I give it 10 Billion up votes
PET THE PUPPY!!!!
That has to be the happiest dog around.
how to get babes this is noted.
Everyone is happy in this video, makes me happy.
That’s why I can’t take my frenchy anywhere, we get bogged down by people who just have to love on him and he’s such a ham 😊
OMFG is this mad max fluffy road
Alright. This might just be the ice breaker I need with the ladies.
This guy and doggie making everyone’s day out there‚ awesome
never thought i'd say i missed packed subway cars with no masks.
Nah man your girl stole my girl.
That video was the best 5 minutes on reddit.
Amazing how 1 dog can bring smiles to many.
I love how basically the entire human race has the same reaction when seeing a dog!
This is why dogs are amazing. Seeing these people’s faces light up as they’re petting her is priceless.
Maxine!!!   ❤️❤️❤️
How happy must a dog be to have a life where basically everyone it meets wants to be nice to it? That must be pretty wonderful.
Are you the original madmax_fluffyroad?
This restores my faith in humanity.... like a simple fluff magnet brings out the best in people. Everyone is happy to give a good girl some pets regardless of their social situation, race, creed, etc. All for the enjoyment of petting a dog.
It’s videos like this that just makes me want to say f**k COVID. Miss seeing people smile.. :(
Wow! this video made me realize how much I miss the city of before Covid, I actually got misty.
What backpack is that? I am trying to find one for my Corgi!
Have Corgi.. can confirm they get mobbed with attention almost everywhere they go. I take my buddy on ride's with me, he's famous at the Dunkin Dounuts I stop at lol.
It’s illegal to see her and *not* touch her
Everyone with a friendly corgi, especially if you use a backpack, experiences this. It's the magic (and mild downside) of owning a friendly corgi.
Username does not check out.
This has to be old footage because I see nary a mask.
Basically if we all had a backpack with a pupper in it, there would be no more problems in the world. 

Let's make it happen.
Maxine!!!  You’re onto me. I want that sweet and sassy girl
It’s so amazing how dogs can bring so much joy out in people simply by... being dogs... they are magical creatures.
This was the BEST video I have seen in a long time !!  I was having a rough day, but when I saw this, I had to smile, in fact it brought tears to my eyes....somewhere, someway, there is still love and light in this world, and animals are the angels bringing this blessing !  LOVE the song, too, by the way!
I miss people
Maxine is perfect
The worlds emotional support dog
I'm a ridiculous dog person and I would kiss my dogs on the face all the time.  

But I'm wincing as these complete strangers put their face in the face of a dog that can't back away and even kiss them - obviously this pup is super accustomed to it and accepting but these people don't know that!  It would only take a little defensive/scared snap to rip someone's lip open.

Am I the only one?
Life is so much better without a mask in sight but smiles instead.
>!woof!<
Level 100 chick magnet.
My dog would fucking love this
I love how dogs easily bring smiles to people's faces. Dogs are such a blessing.
Shes irresistable!
Dogs. No other words needed.
Note to self, want a girlfriend, get a Corgi.

I wish this video was soo much longer
You’re making everyone smile 😃 ❤️🤗🥰💕great job..
All fun and games until it does a turd down your back!
Dogs and cats have managed to create a better life for themselves simply by looking cute to humans.

I'm beginning to think we might be the dumber species.
Can confirm, I wanna steal his girl.

Source: Am human.
I love how it doesn't matter who you are. If you see a dog on someone's back like that it puts a smile on your face.
It’s so weird to see people without masks
LOL I have 100% seen you on the subway. Incredible moment of joy when you realize there is a pup on ya.
I wouldn't blame anyone for wanting to grab that bundle of love and run away... but it wouldn't be right.  She must love all of the attention.  Who wouldn't?
Just a curious question, does she ever get timid or scared? I’ve always wanted to try this but I think my dog would get overstimulated on the subway/in crowds.
need help, i've been wondering what the guy(0:05) says on the video.
Did you just fly from SeaTac airport a couple weeks ago?? I swear I saw this dog in a backpack at the airport!!
Looks like you’re just using the poor dog as a means to get attention
Nice bitch
Maxine makes me happy 😊
wholesome

Edit: Wanted to give the wholesome award, but no coins :/
❣️❣️❣️
Honest question, who just decides to record someone’s dog?
Because dogs make the world a better place. We are all happier when a dog is around
People who dont like dogs have something amiss

Wonder what the world would be like if humans could love each other, like we do dogs.🤔
The top of the dog’s head became a Covid super-spreader event with all those pets
Bastards
This is weird to watch cause no one has masks on
Two things I absolutely adore about this video.  
Cute doggo.

Good people.
attention seeking imo
OK but what type of doggo is this??
I would smother the dog in love 😂❤️
💗
Wholesome 😭❤️
Cutest baby on the planet 😍😍😍
She's a super spreader of love, but probably some other things too
Beautiful and adorable ❤️
Wishing you both many happy, healthy, and prosperous years together!

This is amazing energy and beauty
Madmax_fluffyroad on insta
Someone stole this clip for the 100th time I've seen it
Weird that not a single mask made it in the video.
All I see are a bunch of assholes not wearing masks
Isn't there a mandatory for masks in the subway?
No one wearing masks tho????
If you see this man and his dog in the wild and don't smile, I'll assume you are a monster with no heart.
Why is there not a single person in this vid with a mask. How long ago was that?
Downvoted just for annoying music and likely a repost. This is an old famous video
**NEVER ever ever ever** bring your face close to a stranger's dog's face. that's a great way to earn yourself an expensive trip to the emergency room.

you should be very careful even if it is your own dog...
[deleted]
Found the super-spreader!
That's so mean. Dog can't run the welsh hillsides and is instead trapped in a bag in the most stressful city on earth. I dare you to do a germ swab on that dogs head.
COVID Corgi?
So many dirty hands
That one dude on the subway got a wet nose on the back of his neck and didn't even flinch. Holy fuck he's hard
She’s a 10!
Super cute
i need to do this
You’re in NYC right? I think I might have seen you on the train
Whenever i see someone in public with a dog i can't help but stop and make conversation
I love how she just makes everyone’s day, how sweet!!
Man, all the happiness you have provided...
everybody laughing till they get puked on.
I wonder how many of those people never had a pet before considering is like a kid in a candy store every time
I need a doggo.
I love you Maxine! I'm such a big fan!!
Love magnet
Love, love, love it! Maxine demands pets!
Everyone should be legally required to have dog back carriers in order to spread happiness
Is it just me or anyone else's doggo also reserve love for others and bites for me
These never fail to make me smile :,)
I'm planning on getting a Corgi at the end of this year, is there a particular backpack that's  best for hauling puppers?  


Anyone got an amazon link?
this here is classic 'drowning in p\*ssy'  dear lord.
Hmm I think getting a cute dog might be a good way to meet people. Instant ice breaker, everyone happy especially doggo. Seems obvious but I kinda just realized this. Then I suddenly realize I have to go outside with said dog where other people exist. Many tradeoffs here.
Who needs a wing man when you have doggo? Your corgi is adorable.
Dat is cute
0:19 is that meme with the guy turning away from his girlfriend to check out a girl walking by
Dogs are magical and you cannot convince me otherwise.
That bearded guy was so excited he had to make sure the girl he was with saw!
Really cute, but I wouldn’t want random strangers kissing my dog on the forehead.
This is my favorite post on here, I smiled all the way through
panty dropper
Now someone post how this is deforming her back or something.
Man I don’t care what anyone says, that song’s a fucking bop
good dog enjoying herself.
Me when I bring my dog in her K9 sport sack: “is that a stuffed animal??”
LOL that dog is living a beautiful life!
Its funny cuz they're all different but they all have the same glow in their eyes.
It would be really awesome if humans appreciated and admired the company of humans like they do with pets.  
If anyone who lit up and was so happy to see the dog would have been equally as happy to meet the owner, he would have such a wonderful life.
It always amazes me how a dog can make people so happy
At 0:19 the woman and her friend are the perfect embodiment of the distracted boyfriend meme
I know who that dog is but what breed is it?
Dog Gone It...
Your girl has wondering eyes. She keeps checking everyone out. “U wanna pet ? You get a pet”. What a bit*h
Corgis are the best
Seeing people interact with babies (both human and animal) and doggos is honestly one of the quickest ways to restore some faith in humanity imo.
10000/10 song choice!!!!
That dog is living the life
I want to steal her too. Lovely girl!
the dog's a superspreader
/u/savevideo
Adorable, but why would anyone kiss 1. A stranger's dog, and 2. A STRANGE dog? A pat on the head and an ear rub is just fine.

I love this, every time.
I know this video is from prepandemic, but the lack of masks now makes me incredibly uncomfortable. Luckily there is such a cute doggo too calm me down.
Ah, some good ol pre-pandemic footage...those were happier days.
Everyone kissing that dog during covid...
Me yeah
Thank you for brightening people’s day.
This is what the world needs more of.
Aaaaaand then Corona times happened…
Dude with the beard literally had to hold his girl back.
This dog is slowly getting tired of this.
Omg I’m pretty sure I saw you in the subway once!

This should be in the "how to pick up girls" sub reddit
For a moment I thought I was on r/sarcasm when I saw your name...
he or she is so cute
Not sure if this was asked elsewhere, but what bag do you use? I've carried my dog around in a backpack before but always worried about him overheating.
Does she have any friends? Asking for everyone.
My Aussie Shepherd mix has a fluffy neck like that. I love to bury my face in it.
Meanwhile my corgi barks and sasses at everything that moves 😂
If thisn was my dog he'd literally bark at everything lol
/u/savevideo
Wholesome
I have to ask. On a scale of 1 to 10,  10 being "heck yes" and 1 being "heck no"....
How likely are you to get another corgi? 

Have corgi-mix and...the borks, oh god the borks.
Awwwwwwwooffff
it's great how the reddit video player doesn't play videos and is instead a worthless piece of shit.
That's got to be the happiest dog on the planet.
That is the video I needed today, thanks.
That dog is soooo cute 🥰
Congratulations! This wins reddit. Reddit 2 will start from tomorrow.
There’s footage of the dog sleeping on the guys back In the longer video and it’s so cute ugh
Tbf, she's heckin cute.
This is so fucking cute
this is too precious 😭😭
Pupnapping is a serious offence
A face like that is irresistible.
Well, the lack of masks everywhere says this is probably a repost...

The cutest dogs ;)
I want to see a much longer video of this. 😀
[everybody liked that] she's so cuteee
I wanna know how long it took you to get her used to this and what kind of backpack are you using?
I hope aliens treat us like we treat dogs
She's having the time of her life
Dogs hold all the power
She seems to be super relaxed and happy.
I’m not 100% but the first guy with the balmain shirt and beard looks an awful lot like Junior Gallette
Auuuuuugh!!! Who is this fox-eared floof?!

I have just met him/her, and I already looooooooooove him/her!!! =D

What breed of dog is that?
Lol! It's because she's fluffy looks alert AND is in a pretty cute position because of being in the carrier:)
Our Pets are more lucky than us 🙂❤️
Ah yes, a dog in a backpack bringing a smile to everyone’s face. 😊
Doggos are the solution to world peace!

What breed is that dog
Dogs bring so much happiness! When we have the pup in the car I have to roll the window down in hopes his floppy ears will deter someone’s bad day.
God dammit you did it again. You restored my faith in humanity!
I have 2, they are the best!
This needs to be played on television regularly to remind people how good pre-covid life was
0.38 that lady is uh definitely dog pilled
WHOLESOME
It's so weird seeing everyone without masks
Corgi are the best❣️
Dogs act like nobody loves them at home. Mine acts like she's doesn't have 2 beds regular walks and good food. She's out there whoring her self to any one who will give her attention.
My dog isn’t exactly back pack sized, but after seeing this I think I can make it work
Let them

This will probably get lost but I just wanted to say I am sad when I found out 'Stephanie' wasn't real.
Clearly, that dog has a hard life.
awwwww. so wholesome! I am so torn between getting a pitbull or corgi(if the shelter has one) I mean in actually 97% going to get a pitty because I've always connected with them and they get a bad rap, while, as this video shows, everyone adores those little corgi legs!! so I'm set on a pitbull till I see a corgi picture or vid and I'm like, "unlesss..."


tldr: dogs are the goodest and we dont deserve them 🥰
/u/savevideo
So cute 🥰
Save the video comment ???
They're so cute! Can't blame the people.
How do you make your dog poo?
There's just something about a corgi in a backpack
What kind of a world must she think we live in? I also have a dog that is stranger friendly, and people either ignore her or get very excited to pet her upon seeing her. They must think that the world is just full of wonderful friendly people waiting to meet them. I want to see the world like that
What bag do you use? I have a burnt loaf corgi, and he’s an old man who needs to be carried for parts of our longer walks. I’m really worried that the wrong bag will hurt his long back, but your girl seems so comfy in her bag!

Others who have bags like this, your input is also really really appreciated. Thank you!
You make people so happy!
So.

Many.

Pets!
I got dog to satisfy my selfish desire to control another living creature.
What breed is your dog exactly? Is it a pure corgi or is there something else in there?
Across the spectrum, puppy dogs makes people laugh and smile.  That was nice to see.
Am I the only one who hates people trying to pet my dog?

Watching this during a pandemic just makes me think that I would need to wash my dog every time I got home.
This is why I love dogs ❤️
I love that chick who was walking with her boyfriend and had to almost be restrained so she didn't freak out or something.
I don’t let people touch my dog unless I know them. 
A mask won’t help if you let strangers in public with unwashed hands grab your dogs snooot and then let her lick your face lol. I don’t get it. KEEP OFF MY SWEET PRODIGINAL BABY PRINCE.
Thank you for sharing her. It gives all those people a breather and something to smile about.  👍
That dog's head started the Covid pandemic.
Let’s hope this gets you a date bro! lol
The wholesomeness I think we all needed
I hope people ask first. 

I always thought it was weird when people would just come up and pet my Eskie when we were on walks.
I like the girlfriend who turned on her heels like she was going to pursue the dog and had to be stopped by her boyfriend 😂

Every time I see this video it makes me happy.
That pooch is living the best life possible!
What kind of dog is it?
That gets more action in one outing, than I’ve
have had my whole life!
You can tell this is an ancient receptacle of human history due to the lack of Karen’s shouting “back away and mask up you disease gathering lunatic!” And then proceeding to unmask to yell more and get really close.
This dog is a super spreader... of cuteness
Very cute...buuuut....
Why is no one wearing a mask?!?! Please tell me this was taken pre-covid
How could you not
That dog must think she is a goddess
Maybe this is a dumb question, but what about when your dog has to go to the toilet? Does she let you know when you have to let her down and out?
Plot twist, actually a male dog
❤️❤️❤️ what a beautiful girl you have, not gonna lie, I love her like everyone else!
Holy chick magnet Batman!
So cute 🥰🥰🥰
I’ve never owned a pet, so I have to ask, how is that dog so quiet and not barking at all these strangers? Was it trained that way or is it just a docile personality of the dog?
I love seeing the wholesome smiles
Looks just like my American eskimo sheltie mix Pita!  She's the sweetest
I'm sure you and her make a bunch of people's days!
I used to love this old video but in a covid world this video stresses me out now
Curious how many people have indirectly kissed because of doggos nose.
Really sweet pupper though
Dogs are the best :)
Man, pre-covid America seems like a fucking alien planet now ._.
Had an idea to rent dogs and puppies to millennial guys.  Perfect way to start a conversation with a girl.  But the liability is too costly
It’s amazing to see so many people’s faces brighten up when they see your dog
I aspire to one day be one of these people. I want to own a dog that is way too large to not be a hunting dog but train it to be super sweet and just take it on walks in public places and let people pet the very large dog.
I want a girlfriend; I am getting a dog.
I’m just thinking how much longer that trip to stopping so much
I mean c'mon, who can resist?!
Wow so much joy was spread that day!
Best dating advice: 1. Get a Corgi. 2. Leave home with them.
[this](https://i.imgur.com/3Hb7zvC.jpg)
I love this! But just curious now how would one know when the dogs gotta use the bathroom? Would they just nibble on the ear or somethin? 😂😂
Our chorgi looks just like her. Unlike her, mine would bark at everyone and would just be a nuisance.
i want to be a puppy
COVID super duper spreader!

Seen this dog a few times in nyc over the years lol
It's fair since she stoles everyone's heart.
Anyone know what breed of dog this is?
I want to be a dog now :(
No matter how tough you may be nobody can resist a corgi
This is super fucking cute.
Fun fact: this dog is a husky.
How do you keep your Corgi in the bag?
Any chance you could share a link or brand name on the bag she's in? I've got an old girl who gets tired on hikes. <3
I've seen you on the subway so many times, love your dog
Is this what the world was like before covid?
I’d like to be reincarnated as a dog
And that’s how I met your mothers
Why isnt whe walking on her own? Doesnt look like she haves disablillitys so why?
God damn this is cute. Only crazies would pass up petting that gem
Aw pre-COVID days in nyc 🥲🥲

Do you still let people pet her in the pandemic? I mean i don't have a problem but surely that is potentially some major germs?
It's amazing how something as simple as a dog in a backpack can completely brighten someone's day. Good on you, OP.
bruh I've legit seen you and your dog on the nyc subway before

want to say around midtown
Animals unite people better than anything else.
She's just eating up that loving
What kind of pack back is he using? I feel like my dog would really enjoy this lol
Best wingman ever.
The ultimate wingman
This is a lovely video, but this is also one of the main reasons why I don't want a dog. Dog owners, do you not get uncomfortable when strangers want to pet your own dog? You wouldn't go up to any child and start talking to them and rubbing their hair, so I think it's strange when someone goes up to a stranger's dog and starts interacting - especially if they don't ask first.
So cute!!! Makes me want to steal her!
Stop giving this moron the attention he so clearly craves.
I've a craving for hot dog right now
All I can think about is the germs.... Everyone touching my dog..
I want an entire music video here
Not six feet and that dogs not wearing a mask
I love Maxine
This is another reason why dogs should be allowed to have their own cafes worldwide.
Anyone know what breed of dog that is?
Damnit I should have done this when I was single.
I wish I was one of them..

Work in NYC and it would make my month to see this guy and his sweet corgi.  Haven’t yet but I’m still hoping!
All I can think of is Covid-19 when I see this
Do not worry about it BUY Some DOGE
Serious question, what kind of backpack is that? My dog is starting to get old and I'm looking for options to take her out of the house for longer times and whatever you're wearing looks perfect for her
Awkward thought but do you ever wonder how many people pet your dog and don't wash their hands?
So much joy in a single video it's beautiful
love  her head rolls like “who wants to pet me? You get to pet me! YOU get to pet me
ah, pre-pandemic times
Please look at me please look at me HEEEEY PUPPER!!!!!
The two built dudes at :06. 

Everyone is hard until they see a cute puppy. :)

As an introvert not sure if this would be awesome or stressful.
Your girl stole my heart!
What kind of bag do you have?
No wonder the queen just replaces one corgi with another. Attention Magnet
Oh, I think she stole THEIR hearts 🥰
The goodest of girls
I love how no one cares until they notice they're being recorded!
I wanna a dog too ...
Its like fishing with dynamite its not even fair!

Look how much happiness you and your girl are spreading, so nice
SMOL
wholesome as heck
As I miss Seattle
happy dog
How do you save videos to download and share without directing someone to use Reddit?
0:05 - 0:07 I thought it was James Harden and DeMarcus Cousins.

&#x200B;

Left: James Harden because of the beard

Right: DeMarcus Cousins because of his eyes, smile, teeth, mouth, etc...
That dog is living it’s best life.
Patient zero.
Dogs make everything better!
I got a quarantine puppy and it’s amazing how people assume they can just start touching my dog without even asking. Like the middle of a pandemic is an even more appropriate time to make sure I’m cool with it. My dog is not public property
Where do you get a corgi?
Honestly, doggos must feel like celebrities!
omg my heart. not sure whether this is actually your video but if it is, please protect your baby at all costs. unfortunately i read horrific stories about people hurting pets right in front of their owners, so maybe don't trust everyone and let strangers touch her all the time. she is worth it. whats her name?
What back pack is this? I think my little dude would love it!
0:27 lmao their reactions xD
Maxine!!!
What I love about this the most is how smiley everyone is to see the pupper!
I always appreciate a post from you guys 🥰
Why is this making me emotional? Like I love that dogs can just bring people together and bring so many people joy in their day.
Dogs don't belong in rucksacks.

This is @madmax_fluffyroad on Instagram for anyone wanting to see more
Good times.
What is that carrier? Do they make them in smaller sizes?
What ate you carrying her in? I'd like to get something similar for  my dog!
Imagine how dirty it’s head must be
I miss meeting people. Haven’t petted any dog recently. Strange, as I always thought I am introvert. Fuck Covid
Somebody needs attention
You should've gotten about 20 numbers there (assuming you're single)
u/SaveThisVideo
You brought a few seconds of joy to 100s of people.
Everybody tryna take her love away...
See, people ARE good
So many smiles 🥺💕
Today we get to play our favorite game, *“Was This Video Taken Before the Deadly Pandemic or During the Pandemic With Far Too Many Maskless Twatwaffles Running Around Trying to Locate Their Missing Braincells, OR is This in a Country Who Actually Got Its Shit Together and Not Only Is Finished With Their End of the Outbreak but Also Isn’t Trying To Break the World Record of Least Responsible World Power?”*

Title is a work in progress, might need to remove a word or two before the TV Execs pick us up for late night
Itz deh floofz!
Covid magnet
That dog is living my dream.
Most wholesome aww of 2021?
Too precious

Maxine!!!
Awww, pre-covid reality.
This actually made me tear up a bit. She makes everyone so happy! Their faces just light up. So sweet.
How many more times are you going to milk the ever living shit out of this video?
Its impossible not to love a corgi.
Imagine if we responded to each other the way we respond to dogs!
Okay that whole thing was just.. beautiful
Maxine!!
Dogs makes the world a better place.
Oh, what a cute dog! I would stroke her too
Can’t wait for the next installment! I love this pup.
I jealous of how many girls that dog got to make out with lol
So cute!!😍😍

Thank you kind stranger, with all the shit happening around the world, your video put a smile on my face and made me forget about this pandemic!
I want to visit NY just on the off chance I run into MadMax.
This made me smile
Doesn't anyone wear a mask
If you're single, I hope you're taking advantage of all those opportunities.
Imma try this with my Chow Chow.
Every Doggo needs this life
What an awesome way to bring more smiles into the world!
A beautiful life before COVID
Cant wait to see the Berlin version of this
Ah, the before times.
I think your corgi had a good day
She is adorable.
What is she called? Wife-magnet?
I think you're in denial. She's actually "slippin' round" on you behind your back. 

It is so wonderful to see a dog so well suited to a particular lifestyle actually get to live that lifestyle. She's truly a lucky dog. Thank you for giving her such an amazing life.
Portable happiness
Damn that’s a women magnet, and there’s men too

It's so beautiful to see that love of dogs transcends age, race, and gender
Was that Disguised Toast?

The World looks so much kinder through Doggie eyes ..I Love it ..
How do I do this with a 100lb dog?
This made me so happy I could cry. Gdi...
I relate so much to the people kissing the pup on the head. Just can’t resist 🥺
Your dogs probably screaming holy f*** my lower vertebrae and tail hurts please take me out of this trap if I complain too much or make too much noise my owner will f****** hit me and there's nothing I can do because it's always better for me if I don't complain.
More like she got covid doe
What breed is this? She looks the closest like my dog, Whiskey, who died when I lived in Asia many years ago. I never knew her breed but this is similar.
