She‚Äôs a doll. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll continue to surprise and amaze you in the years to come. Just try not to cry too much! Happy birthday, pretty lady!
Congratulations, from a fellow parent of a child with cerebral palsy (5 year old boy w/ moderate)! This really is huge! She also seems to be bending her limbs well, which is awesome. It‚Äôs the absolute best when you can find the right motivator. Give her a birthday hug from this random stranger on the internet who‚Äôs very proud of her! 
Edit: Improved wording
Hey, from a disabled daughter, thank you for celebrating the little victories ‚ô•Ô∏è I‚Äôve been able to break barriers and to things I was never ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to be able to do, for this exact reason. Celebrate that curiosity and determination. She‚Äôs gonna do great things, and she‚Äôs lucky to have support like you.

EDIT: thanks for the silver, I‚Äôm so touched by your guys comments. Apparently I needed a good cry ‚ô•Ô∏è keep being lovely humans, all you people.
EDIT: now gold! To all of you messaging me and sending me your stories, I‚Äôm blown away. My heart is so full. I don‚Äôt have CP but I know that the road with disability is a long one. Parents that are struggling: your efforts MATTER and MAKE A DIFFERENCE. Celebrate every day. üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è
Thanks everyone!  Did not expect this much love.  She had an awesome day and you all have mommy in tears. ü•∞ü§óüò≠ https://imgur.com/gallery/WxBaBx2
Oh is that one of those beady slidey things that are always at pediatricians‚Äô offices?! I‚Äôve never seen one in the wild. 

And yayyyyyy!!!

Edit: Punctuation
  Back in the late 1990's I was working as a palaeontologist and was assigned a summer student...a 17 year old male with cerebral palsy. I thought 'oh no, I have a lot of work that needs done'. I can't babysit this kid.

Anyways this kid proved a great asset. We had just received a new device called a 'scanner'. He was the only one who knew how to use it and devised a new technique (we still use) to scan small objects and post the photos into a word file (back then 'FileMaker'). It was great to have a hand-on catalogue of research papers updated with new specimens.

 A confession.  At first I didn't recognize he was 100% mentally normal. It took a few days for me to see past the physical disability. However, it was a lesson that I learned to treat an individual with a neurological issue as an adult and not talk down to them.

what a gorgeous little face she has! 
my brother has cerebral palsy, epilepsy and had a stroke at 2 weeks old. we were told he‚Äôd be a vegetable and he‚Äôd never speak and they didn‚Äôt expect him to live very long.
well those doctors couldn‚Äôt be more wrong, he started walking and talking around 4-5 years old. he‚Äôs now 23, extremely healthy, played soccer for his state in the disabled league, graduated high school and he‚Äôs now engaged to a lovely lady.. every day that boy makes me so proud! 

good luck to you OP and your beautiful daughters future! 
Love to you and your Angel.  
Hey, here‚Äôs a comment from an actual person with CP! (21F, left-sided hemiplegia)

I‚Äôm fully ambulatory, but I have little dexterity in my left hand and I wear an AFO on my left leg to keep it stable and improve my stamina, though I can walk without it.

Keep going! It‚Äôs gets better with time, as you learn how to better communicate with each other.

Therapy, doctors and potential surgeries will always be there in some form, so always stick to a schedule to keep it routine and familiar for her. I joined an adaptive kayaking club this summer, and it‚Äôs a fun way to get moving.

Also, there are hundreds of adaptive devices she can use as she gets older. For example, I use:
* An adaptive dressing aid to put on my bra
* Elastic shoelaces (since I can‚Äôt tie)
* A speech-to-text software to dictate a novel I‚Äôm writing

Best of luck to you and make sure she knows that nothing can hold her back!

Why would you put this on Reddit 
[deleted]
I really don't understand why people post pics of their kids on reddit, no matter the circumstance 
How do I upvote this at least 10000 times?

happy birthday!! üéâüéàüéÇ 
It‚Äôs an aww for all of us too. We are not all angry cynics and I‚Äôm glad you posted this. Happy birthday to your little one. Stay strong mom and dad, these types of moments make it all worth it. My son is almost 9, every single day has been an aww moment for me. Be proud of your daughter and all that she does. 
My birthday mate. She's beautiful too. 
[deleted]
The part of this that warmed my heart is that you had her scoot to it and didn't just deposit her in front of the toy. I hope it is stimulates her and provides much entertainment. Well done, parent!
*sort by controversial*
Really cute. Reminds me that of all my toys when I was a kid, this one always stood up. I still remember it so vividly. 
No offense but I find all of these posts with humans in them annoying and the opposite of aww. I wanna see a kitten
anyone find it weird people on reddit pimp out their disabled four year olds 
Using your disabled child for karma is disgusting 
This sub sucks
This shouldn‚Äôt be posted here
Go away I‚Äôm here to see animals 
My daughter has cerebral palsy as well. I love when she scoots over and just wants to play. Thats a great toy for working the fine motor skills. I do the same stuff with my natalie. Hope hers and your christmas is bright.  :) 
Hey so i know its a bit early but when she gets older look into adaptive skiing in your area.

I help run a program in Michigan and we have had several kids with CP that we work with.  Our oldest member right now went from a 3 person crew and ski walker to 1 person and outriggers as he got older and its been amazing watching him grow and learn and get stronger.
r/antinatalism fuel 
You should be ashamed of yourself for whoring your child with a disability out for fake internet points. She isn‚Äôt to be aww‚Äôd at by strangers on here you jackass doofus
Is she mentally handicapped or is it just physical? Palsy always confused me. She seems like a spark of joy, I just want to learn more about this case.

Did you rob a dentist?
Teenager with CP here. Trust me it will get better from here. When I was her age, I had to use a walker to get around. Now in high school, I don't need anything to walk now. Yes there are some things that I struggle with physically but it's gotten a lot better. 
This is so awesome but I'd just like to take the time to point out the dog in the first picture üòÇüòÇ
Just giving a heads up as I didn't find anyone else mentioning him but if you don't know him, check out the comedian Zach Anner. He has cerebral palsy (which he famously described as "the sexiest of the palsies") and has an insanely positive attitude. 

He wrote a book called "If At Birth You Don't Succeed" that goes through his struggles with a light hearted voice. 

He also did a bunch of stuff on youtube, and had his own tv show for a season.

Best of luck to you!
As someone with (albeit semi mild) CP, this is awesome to see. Progress with these things is slow and steady, but when it happens, it comes quicker than you'd expect!

I know this is only the beginning of your daughter's progress, and I just wanna thank you for being caring and supportive - having good family and friends is the most insanely helpful thing imaginable.

Have a happy holiday, OP!
This is so heart warming 
Why didn‚Äôt you just put it closer to her 
/r/nosobstories
I wonder about the ethics of posting a child's image to such a public forum when they are unable to consent. Was the child asked for permission? How might they feel about their parents sharing their image like this when they get older? 
So let‚Äôs milk her for karma!
booooooooo!!!!! how the fuck does this stupid shit get so many fuckin upvotes 
This seems exploitative for internet points. 
OK

Happy Birthday, beautiful! 
She is a beautiful girl.
My great-aunt had CP.  She helped raise me and was more like a grandmother than an aunt.  She just passed away on 10/29 at the age of 93.  Your little one is beautiful.  I wish her a long and happy life like my Aunt‚Äôs.  
She is awesome! As someone with CP the only limits I had/ have are the ones defined by others. She will continue to suprise you with how she adapts. As I am sure you are aware, it's not easy but she will thank you for it in the future, I promise!!!!
I have a first cousin with CP. When he was born he weighed just over a pound and was hooked to machines for his first several months just to survive. He‚Äôs almost 36 now, and to look at him you‚Äôd never know he ever had any struggles with health in his life. He‚Äôs blind in one eye and has a slight struggle with mobility because one of his legs are slightly longer than the other, and will of course need to be cared for for the rest of his life, but nevertheless is the most content and positive person I know. In fact, I‚Äôm sure he thinks that he‚Äôs normal and the rest of us are the ones that struggle. I try to remember that when I start to overreact to trivial things. I‚Äôve learned my greatest lessons in life from him without him ever even trying to teach me. 
She looks like she is sick of the palsy. 

To be fair, if I had to spend my life struggling to do the simplest task, I'd be pretty sick of the palsy too.
My brother has mild CP, but originally was diagnosed to be unable to do almost about anything. He persevered through it all and now today he is attending college and even managed to make a JV basketball team before he graduated high school. I remember growing up seeing his challenges, and they were many, but I‚Äôm glad he prevailed. Your daughter looks like a fighter too and I‚Äôm glad she has parents that support her like this.
Awesome! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Let's exploit a disabled child from karma... Yay
As a mature male with cerebral palsy: Good Job, girl.
Fellow CP parent here. Just so you know, our daughter adopted from China 23 years ago is on track to graduate from community college in June. She was where your daughter is 19 years ago. It's one day at a time for a long time but it is an amazing journey. Wishing your family well on yours!
I have Cerebral palsy.   I'm completely physically self sufficient and work 2 jobs after getting a college degree with honors. Everyone is different but if you don't hold her back,  if you encourage her to TRY and never tell her that she just can't,  if you let her learn to protect herself within her ability instead of always over protecting, she might grow up to be more than you dreamed 
This is sad, not cute.
I have to say I'm disappointed in you mods due to the fact that just a couple weeks ago you removed my picture of my daughter with juvenile arthritis with our dog during a bad day stating it broke the rules of nothing sad, but this picture was allowed. That being said, this is a great pic, I know what it feels like to have a child in pain that you can not help, and how great it is to see them forget about the pain and just be a kid for a little while. 
Great, another sob story post on front page.
I was born with cerebral palsy as well. Its amazing what can be done! This is awesome.

Kid run! That's not a toy! It is a contraption that looks like a toy but it will help you get better! You'll enjoy it but don't get fooled!
She is undeniably adorable, goodness gracious. 

Happy 4th birthday, ya little angel!
She is so freaking adorable! Happy belated birthday!!!!!

As a educational assistant for severly coded children this totally warms my heart. Definitely a moment that you should be proud of her.
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY sweet girlüòÄ
Thanks for the tears. 

Adorable. 
Happy Birthday to your angel üòá she is so cute üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww she is so precious! As a single man with not even a partner, I can only imagine how beautiful it must be to have a little one in your life, good luck and much love!! 

Edit: I don't get the downvotes... I am saying I don't have a wife so probably I won't have kids even if I feel like being a dad, so am sending good luck and good wishes to his family but whatever...

Poor baby, I hope when she is old enough that you will be able to give her treatment.
Amazing!

&#x200B;

For anyone else who has a child with CP, make sure he or she is followed by a pediatric physiatrist. Spasticity management is a major component of care, and appropriate management is life-changing for both the child and the caregivers!
I wish her all and nothing but the best!
I'm 23, this is still a cool toy! 
[deleted]
Hell ya!  As a parent myself, I'll be proud for you guys as well!  Keep that positivity, she'll feel it.

Happy Holidays!
As a mom and an OT, I highly recommend this toy.   Your daughter will do well with all your love and support.    
Thank you. For everything you are doing. She looks like a sweetheart!
She‚Äôs absolutely beautiful. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your daughter is beautiful! There is nothing better than seeing your child succeed against adversity. She's a strong one!
Happy birthday! 
What a beautiful young lady, happy birthday!üéà
This thing is so cool.  Im glad your daughter seems to be enjoying it.  Wish me luck for when I give our daughters one for christmas.  Get it from Target??
Thanks, this made my day! 
Good job, sweet girl!! And happiest of birthdays :)
You go girl! 
Oh my god that face she is so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
This child is adorable even now she brings joy to my heart! You are great parents!
So many people, and so many challenges in the world. I wish you a very Merry Christmas! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Happy Birthday! Hope all of you had a great time :) beautiful picture
What a darling child

My 26 year old brother has CP. The thing that helped him the most was an experimental surgery where they opened his spinal column just like how they used to cut the subway bread, and they deadened groups of nerve bundles. He grew an inch and a half after that surgery just from the release of muscle tension, and enabled him to be loose enough to do physical therapy. Congrats to your girl! Those little firsts add up. 
Hang in there. My sister has cerebral palsy and is married, a college graduate and is the mother to my wonderful niece.
Amazing how the triumphs of some are so different than those of others. What an amazing moment for you and your family. I wish the best in your future endeavors. 
Happy Birthday, Sweet Loveybug!!!!! You're amazing! 
I work with special needs children, specifically with Autism and epilepsy through DHS, and it is such a wonder and marvel how badass these kids are! Every day for the past 14 years every child I have come in contact with is a source of love and laughter (and a whooooole lot of tears, good and not so great.)  
Again, Happy Birthday, little lady! You are a champion and you make the world a better place! <3
It‚Äôs really incredible how my heart melts every time  my son learns something new. Being a father brings so much joy and happiness. 
Makes me so dang happy that I don't know what to do with myself! Happy Birthday from another internet stranger sweet girl!
That's Great. Happy birthday!
Congratulations on this amazing progress! I wish you and your family a merry Christmas, may 2019 bring even more surprises to you all
So happy for you. Her too.
Cheers to you and your magnificent daughter!
She is beautiful. 
Such a sweet baby. 
Make sure you take her to a good occupational therapist! They can help so much with CP
What a great toy for her! People get these for babies and there‚Äôs just so much going on visually that babies just move along to something else. 
I cant look at those wire toys and not feel a desire to push the blocks along their path. I'm 35 lol. Great gift choice, your daughter is precious.
That's awesome! Give her a hug for me, shes doing great!!
I‚Äôm late to the party, but good for her and you. So many parents don‚Äôt let their kids work for it. Good for you. 
I work in Early Intervention. This is something you  deserve to be very proud of
If it‚Äôs okay, can I share her story? 
She looks like a total sweetie.  So special when they are inspired  by a great toy.
YO REAL TALK YOUR BABY GIRL IS BEAUTIFUL AND i HAVE TEARS IN MY EYES. i HOPE YOUR LIVES CONTINUE TO BRING BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS LIKE THIS.

Edit: Caps on my apologies but it still stands. You have me crying a bit dude.
She will get stronger over time. A supportive family can be the difference maker in these situations. She needs to have the will to push herself and improve and it seems that she is getting that from you. 
She is adorable and I love how engaged she is with the awesome toy. Happy Birthday Young Lady!
She is so cute! Thanks for sharing this. Brightened my day.
Today is my daughter's first birthday!!!! 
Happy birthday to your sweet girl! Shes adorable.
Happy Birthday!!!! Keep making your mom and dad proud!
She is beautiful!!! Thank you for sharing :) 
As a fathet to a little girl i always wonder whats the next thing she will do.to make me cry. Nice work dad
Aww man I‚Äôm so happy for her. Thanks for making me feel good.
Oh my goodness. My heart just melted. What an amazing little girl you have ‚ù§Ô∏è. 
From one CP-er to another...

Happy birthday, kiddo. You‚Äôre doing all right.
That is awesome!!!! So proud of her! Parents, keep it up. Youre obviously doing a great job!!!
‚ù§üëä
She‚Äôs a doll! 
This is absolutely lovely. I hope she enjoys the toy! She looks like such a sweet girl. 
She is adorable and is unbelievably lucky to have you to guide her in life through her eyes. Happy birthday to you cutie pie!
Happy birthday!!!
Respetoüòá
You did good :-)
CP hasn‚Äôt held her back from being a little cutie.  
üòç
Annnnnnd I‚Äôm crying.. ‚ù§Ô∏è
üéàüéäüéÅüéÇHappy Birthday kiddo!!! üéÇüéÅüéäüéà
She‚Äôs beautiful. My cousin has CP and at 21, he is leading an almost normal life. I know not every case is like his, but I hope it gives you comfort that your little girl will have some ‚Äúnormal‚Äù experiences. ‚ù§Ô∏è
She's beautiful. Happy birthday to her!
She's absolutely beautiful!
As a 31 year old with CP it warms my heart to see parents who celebrate every victory. While I cant say my life has been easy I can say the love and encouragement my family showed me made nothing impossible. No victory is small and no success is simple. God bless you for the love you freely give and thank you for sharing it with the world 
I am a parent of twin boys both with cp. One of them is more severe and we were told when he was very young that it would be unlikely that he would walk. One Xmas we got them one of those little tikes basketball hoops. He was a wiz at making baskets with that thing. He liked it so much that he learned to pull himself up to stand, with the help of a chair, to make better shots. I can't help to think that that b ball hoop got him to walk. Many years later after much ot, pt, and surgeries he walks like a champ. It makes me happy to see others celebrate little goals with their children.  
Awesome. So, so awesome. Parents of children who do not have special needs cannot even begin to understand the joy of seeing our kids do what is a trivial task to most kids. I am willing to bet that that table starts a turning point for her. It will help her develope her gross motor skills and maybe add a little strength to push her to the next level.
Happy Birthday sweetheart! Hugs to you and your little angel üòò
She is absolutely beautiful and so are you for capturing this moment. Best of wishes from your friend on the Internet 
As a father with a son with CP,  yeah, I'm crying.  Beautiful. 
Cool story bro...
Just wanted to share that I also have cerebral palsy and have had what I consider a very successful life so far ( Male, 21 ). I work on my body constantly and am able to do 5k‚Äôs with relative ease and do minor upper body work daily. I‚Äôm in a committed relationship, am graduating from Penn State next fall with a political science degree and have a job working for the State Senate. I couldn‚Äôt have done any of this without the help of my family, give her the love and support that she needs and she‚Äôll do great things.
I want nothing more, in my entire existence, than to work to cure anything and everything that makes children suffer.

My time on earth would be worth it if I could help one little girl live up to her ambition.
Happy Birthday to her, she‚Äôs precious! God bless and love out to your beautiful family!!
<3!
üéÇüéâHAPPY BIRTHDAY! üéâüéÇ Awesome job, young lady!! God bless, stay strong and keep on keepin‚Äô on!!
Much love to this beautiful soul!
Unconditional love. The force is strong in this one. 
How beautiful is this?! 
She‚Äôs ridiculously adorable and has so many more surprises in store for you. Thanks for sharing this one with us‚ù§Ô∏è
She is precious! I wish you and her much happiness!
She is absolutely beautiful! What a cool toy to promote play and development! üíó
Shea beautiful! Happy birthday!!! They grow up so fast...
Fuckkk Im sorry and happy for you. She's beautiful, I hope you guys fight as hard you can.
Congratulations to her and a happy birthday.  She looks so happy.  I am so happy for you and your family.  She is truly a blessing and blessed to have parents who love and care for her as much as you obviously do. Enjoy it all.  They grow so fast.  Continue to celebrate those victories even though kids look at you like "what is wrong with you crazy person" (or at least mine do üòÅ).  
There are no words to describe what I feel. Especially now when I have a grandson. Thanks God totally healthy. I‚Äôll pray for you to be strong and for her to get better. 
Great job sweetie
Happy birthday girly üéä
You can see the wheels turning in her head! Absolutely beautiful, man
Happy Bday Princess.

Happy birthday Precious. You can tell how much she adores that toy!
Hey your full name is my full name!!
She's beautiful! My best friend has CP and she's one of the smartest, funniest, and strongest people I know. We laugh so much it should be illegal. She has lived a pretty normal life working, socializing,has been married almost 20 years now, and she gives the best advice!
Happy Birthday, sweet girl üíú

As a grown woman with cerebral palsy I just wanted to say this is amazing and I hope you all keep working with her and for her, even when it feels impossible. She will do great things üíú
Happy birthday little sweetie, best wishes to you‚ô°
Hii, your daughter is beautiful and I can see she is going to be very encouraged and have very supportive parents.

I too have Cerebral Palsy (24F) Spastic diplegia.
I grew up having a custom wheelchair and special shoes as I could not walk any form of distance and very weak as a child.

I now cycle, just graduated with a Bachelor's degree and currently undertaking teacher training.

She will have to work a little harder than everyone else but I think that hard work shapes who we are. She may feel down every now and then because some individual's are cruel but she will be a fighter. The world is her oyster. Nothing will hold her back if she wants it enough :)


I wish you the very best xxxx
Adorable <3
I am so happy for you and your entire family! Congratulations for it all! I hope she continues to amaze you!
As a new parent, this slays me in the feels.
Happy Birthday to a beautiful girl!
I‚Äôm so happy that THIS post is the most upvoted I‚Äôve ever seen! At time of commenting it‚Äôs at 98k!! 
Happy birthday! What a beautiful little girl you have. Happy holidays to your wonderful family.
My Mom had cerebral palsy. She lived to be 90 and I have always felt fortunate to be her daughter.  There isn't anything in this world that can limit your daughter as long as she puts her mind to it. Happy Birthday(belated) littleone!

Happy 4th Birthday! 
My sister has cerebral-palsy as well. It's amazing the things they can do when they are surrounded by those who care about them. Happy Birthday to her!
It's so surreal to me seeing kids with cerebral palsy maybe because I've never met one in person. It's something I'll never forgot because of a patient I recieved when I was a caregiver he was 55 years old and his name was Jimmy and boy let me tell you he was awesome! The faces and noises he would make when I'd show up for shifts is something I'll never forget, or when his mom would tell me stories of her telling Jimmy that Ronnie's coming over he would lose it. So many memories with that family seeing this picture brings them all back and makes me want to go visit them! Thanks op and goodluck in life to you and your beautiful baby girl!
This post makes me feel feelings again.
Happy Birthday to that strong young girl! And LOL at the dog in the top left picture just in the frame. He's so happy for her too!!
She's precious. ;_; I hope she had a nice birthday...!
Happy birthday! 
Happy birthday sweetheart!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The first of MANY things you‚Äôll be proud of!!  Hope you have a phone with a lot of storage!!  XOXO 
She looks so damn happy!!!! Happy birthday little one. 
I work in a medical lab and we have this same toy in our phlebotomy waiting room and kids all love it. Heck, I love it! 
My sister has CP. When she was born the doctors said she would have to be in a chair all of her life, that she wouldn't be able to speak, fed her self ect. This week she got a promotion at her job and is now making roughly 200k a year. Strongest women I know. She thrived off of people thinking she would never be anything.

One of my favorite students of all time had CP. Kid had a wicked sense of humor. Your daughter is adorable
Beautiful girl. Hope she has a great holiday.
I have a 4 year old daughter and its a lot of work as it is. Just want to say you have my respect and admiration. 
Sag in the house! Today is my birthday, too. I‚Äôm honored to share it with her. 
As a father of a girl with CP, I noticed she‚Äôs sitting in the W position, which was detrimental to my kid early on, and kept her from walking for a while. Try to get her to sit with both legs to the side, so as to not complicate her leg, hip, and future walking. 

Today, my daughter is a parent to 2, and while it is noticeable in her gait, she has overcome much, to carry her children in pregnancy, and carry them to car seats, etc.

Best of luck to your little one. 
It took me a while to even write something because you just made a bear almost cry (okay, I cried). I wish her the best year ever and judging from the other photo, she's had a marvelous start with cake. Wish you and her nothing but happiness. :)

Wonderful, andI suspect this will not the only time this little lady will amaze you.  Best wishes to the Birthday Girl!
She‚Äôs amazing!!!!!! Way to go kiddo!!! Happy birthday! 
Hey it‚Äôs my birthday too! Happiest birthday to your girl and many more to come!! My cousin (29/m) also has CP. He has always needed a wheelchair or canes and has always had intensive therapy. I just wanted to share with you that he got married this October and is so in love. His biggest fear was that he‚Äôd never find someone to have a family with and he found the perfect one. She will definitely have struggles ahead but I bet you guys have a ton more ecstatically happy moments too!!

Beautiful 
I can‚Äôt remember the last time my heart got this warm, she‚Äôs adorable!
Happy birthday beautiful girl!! 
That has to be both wonderful and heartbreaking. 
Aww, that is tough work sweet girl! Enjoy your new toy!
What a powerful kid... keep it up little one.

Super cute.  I bet she'd love swimming.
Amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è
What a pretty girl! Happy Birthday!
Happy birthday to her. Very cool.
Happiest of birthdays little one!  You are one strong little lady! 
Happy Birthday Little Princess! 
That toy is going to be great for her dexterity! And I'm sure that's why you bought it :-). I have left-sided hemiplegia and it's so great to see you supporting your daughter, she's going to thank you for all of this disguised "therapy" when she gets older. 
My wife has mild cp, among other issues.  I have heard many tales from her family about the progress she made as she grew up. 
I hope she continues to amaze you as she grows, beautiful girl.
What a cutie!

Damn tug at the heart strings why don‚Äôt ya
Happy birthday! We had this exact toy too and loved it!! So many activities :)
Happy birthday mighty girl! 
Happy birthday to your angel! I hope you all had a wonderful day!
Angel!!!
Good job, sweetie!!
What an absolute little sweet heart. Such a heart warming scene
Tell her Happy Birthday from all of us!
Congratulate her for me, from one CP patient to another, one step at a time little dude! Keep on going!
I had a foster sister with CP.

She's a paralegal now. Stay awesome and stay proud, OP. That aww might be doing wonderful things you never dreamed of one day.
The amount of joy, I could only imagine with that little girl is incredible!!!  What a sweet heart!  I‚Äôm sure she loves it!!
Happy Birthday üéâ 
In case anyone hasn't told her yet. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!!
She is very beautiful. We are proud of her too. üëçüèºüëçüèº
What are the challenges of raising a cp child? Just out of curiousity if they are or arent as rambunctious as other children. 
That is a good Christmas 
Our daughters were born on the same day the same year! Cheers to being parents today. And congratulations on her milestone!
Happy birthday to her!  


By the way there is/was a stand-up comedian in Australia that went by "Steady Eddie" who has cerebral palsy.  Some boundaries are... really not.


Be proud.  Every. Day.
That is awesome!!
Looking at controversial first... Commenting here is like running through a mine field. 

Uhhhh, this is a picture.
Omg I love her!!!!! She‚Äôs beautiful!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
She's so beautiful, god bless ‚ù§
Sweet girl

Awesome stuff.  Thanks for sharing such a great moment.  Happy Birthday to your wonderful daughter!
My daughter is four and a half and has a genetic disorder with lots of delays (similar to cerebral palsy in many ways, still scooting!). One of her favorite toys is the [Zany Zoo](https://www.target.com/p/b-toys-zany-zoo-wooden-activity-cube/-/A-12025312)  which looks a lot like what you have there. She absolutely loves it! They‚Äôre common at yard sales. 

Watch out for when she realizes she can grab it by the top and top it up and let it slam on the ground, waking you up at two in the morning when she‚Äôs gotten out of her bed. 
She's beautiful and I'm grateful for your family in this world. Thank you for sharing.
This is awesome! She is beyond beautiful and you are so blessed! Happy Birthday to this angel! ‚ù§Ô∏è
A birthday gift that keeps on giving!!!!
Great congratulations!
She is absolutely precious. Enjoy every second of ‚Äúawww‚Äù you can!
Aww, I love her she's perfect!
God bless her heart. She is going to teach you and your family many things in this life.
So gorgeous.
As someone with CP (19F), seeing this made me cry. Happy birthday. ‚ù§
Happy birthday!!!!!! BIRTHDAY TOYS ARE THE BEST!!!!!!!!!
Your daughter is one brave and amazing young lady God bless her üôè‚úùÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
What a beautiful little human being! Happiest of birthdays to that little angel!
Awwwwesome bday for all of you. 
Jahhhh bless her

‚ù§Ô∏è
What a beautiful little angel. 
This is Beautiful OP. she looks like a sweetheart. 
That‚Äôs awesome, thanks for sharing. 
Where did you get this? My boys love playing with em at the dr
Dude, I freaking loved those things as a kid. I‚Äôm not surprised she was motivated enough to climb up on her own! She‚Äôs adorable btw!
Your post made me smile early in the morning. 

&#x200B;

Much love to you and your daughter. May she go on to do wonderful things. :)
Love this
Awesome!!! 
üòäüíñ
I can feel your pride and your happiness through your picture. I can onliy imagine how great it feels for both you and her. 
Funny how the smallest things are the biggest things when you're a parent. She's adorable and that toy looks awesome. 
I grew up with a kid at school in elementary with CP, we had Tuesday library with the special needs kids where we would read with Steven and the other kids. I remember Steven being so funny and happy. Some say children can be cruel, but I miss those days of being loving
The true strength of the human spirit! : ]
Awwwwe! Good for her! I‚Äôm so happy she loves her new toy! And happy birthday!
Nice, she‚Äôs a cutie. My cousin has cerebral palsy as well. She has no control over her body and is confined to a wheel chair. She has a computer that she can type using her eyes to communicate . It‚Äôs incredible how smart and funny she is. Her brain is as sharp as any one of us.
Aww. She's so sweet x
Happy birthday to your beautiful daughter. She is amazing!
I needed this blip of joy in my day. Hope she enjoys it to the fullest
As a fellow parent to a child with hie, quad cp, Lennox gastou and blah blah blah blah to many to list. I love the look on her face. It is subtle but I would recognize her joy anywhere. I look forward to the day my kiddo can scoot to a toy. So happy for you guys, she's adorable. 
This brought a tear to my eye! Bless her!
My nephew has CP. At that age he had contracted limbs and severely reduced motor skills in general. He is 11 now and can walk short distances unassisted. Keep pushing her and doing an amazing job!
Hell yeah! 
This made my day!
Love the dog's cameo lol
This made my week. üòç
As a mom of a special needs child, it‚Äôs those little things that make your day. 

Happy birthday God bless her. I see these kinds of diseases as blessings instead of curses cuz they help you and your family grow tremendously. My nephew has down syndrome and hes made me and my family grow so much amazing.
Amazing! It should be a great physical/occupational therapy toy too. 
That's a pretty badass toy! 
She's so beautiful! You sound like an absolutely loving and devoted parent; she is very blessed!  May I ask, with complete respect, if her CP is related to birth trauma? My good friend in our RN program 20 years ago had mild CP related to birth trauma, and, as a labor and delivery nurse, this is something I'm extremely cognizant and always concerned about. 
Happy, Happy Birthday to your sweet little girl!!
She is beautiful. 
The dog in the top left is just as happy as the rest of us
This is lovely, she‚Äôs beautiful! Happy birthday to her :)
Sweet girl :)
Happy Birthday!!!!!

Doggo: You heckin seein this too??
Happy birthday to the wonderful little girl. ‚ù§Ô∏è
My birthday ya today too
Thank you for sharing, my tough heart is softened by you post.  Your family is just the inspiration I needed today.  If this was meant to be seen by someone, somewhere in the world, it had to be me.
Hey OP. Your daughter is doing a great work! I have CP too only on the left side (Hemiparesis). I had a looooot of medical and physiotherapy between the age of 2 to 12-14 yrs old but it worth it! I live a normal day and I can do almost everything than a non-cp person. Also, it's kinda new, but Hyperbaric oxygen therapy could help your daughter.

Happy B Day little one. 
I‚Äôve got crippling back pain to the point of borderline paralysis in my legs and seeing posts like your little girl here gives me hope and strength to keep pushing myself to try get better... or at least maintain some sort of control. Thank you and your little one here for giving me a little boost of spirit today. ‚úåÔ∏è 
We share the same birthday! What a milestone!
To be honest, I'd play with the playset for sure as well. Pretty sweet.
Happy birthday princesses 
Amazing stuff!! Love seeing what motivates kids to push against themselves to make gains like this :)


One question - Have you thought about horse riding as part of her development program? 
She is beautiful.
Kudos to her. 
Look what a gorgeous angel she is. So happy you have such a sweet gift!!‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
Blessings!
A happy child. Glad for you OP!
I wanna scoot right up and play with that toy too. It looks awesome. 
Happy Birthday Beautiful! 
That is so awesome! Great job, she must LOVE it!!! Happy Birthday to her!
Thank you for sharing!
She is just so beautiful. I‚Äôm proud of her too!
I love big miracles in little kids 
Happy Birthday beautiful girl!
Cute kid. Nuff said
I've seen this toy many times but don't know what it's called. It's one of the best out there.
She'll get there friend. My cousin has cerebral palsy. It took him some time but he can walk and even drive now. God bless you for your patience and love with her. 
Thanks for sharing. This warmed my heart several degrees.
May I ask how/when did you find out about her condition?
I like how she looks over in the one picture, presumably at you, as if to say " hey, you watchin'?"  She looks too, like she really enjoyed herself. A picture really is worth a thousand words. Keep gettin' it girl!! 
So freakin cute, good for her! Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, sweet girl! 
This is a cool bar I‚Äôm in.

...and now I‚Äôm crying.

She‚Äôs beautiful!!!
Not to that typical pot head but have you tired CBD or thc to see if it helps her ? 
Yayy!!! Happy birthday to this precious girl! 
She is so adorable with the toy that I want it and I‚Äôm in college!
My cousin graduated college and has CP. He had a lot of familial help but he did it. 

He is also one of the kindest people I know and always has a smile on his face despite the life long hardships. 

You have a beautiful daughter and I wish you the best. 
This is very brave of her and of you as well. I can say that I don't think I'd be strong enough to take care of a child with these kind of limitations. 
She‚Äôs beautiful 
Happy birthday to this beautiful little girl she will always surprise you each day to come I wish you and your family all the love
She is the cutest. God bless her
Aw, God bless you all. üòç 
I am so happy to see this. I have grown up with c.p. I was told my entire life what I wouldnt be able to do, and with a special thanks to my mom, I proved everyone wrong. At 31, I am a high end professional carpenter, who builds and rides custom motorcycles. I grew up skateboarding and backpacking, and doing everything every normal kid did. Life is what you make of it, and I decided at a very young age to make it what I want. Continue to support  and push her, there is nothing she can't accomplish. 
My nephew has CP, and this completely brought me to tears. Your daughter is beautiful, and if she‚Äôs anything like my nephew, she‚Äôll constantly and consistently bring joy to everyone around her. Praying for you and your family on this journey!
Happy Birthday to your daughter, she‚Äôs precious! As a little sister to a brother who had CP, cherish every little moment like this (I‚Äôm sure you do!). The doctors told my mom that my brother would never walk or talk, he did both and was the happiest human ever! I love seeing pictures like this, the pure joy, happiness and determination to play with her new toy. :) ‚ù§Ô∏è
it‚Äôs my birthday today too! tell her happy birthday, birthday twin!
go ahead a lie and so you don't play with these whenever you see them.
Your daughter is adorable and you are doing a fantastic job as parents. Keep up the great work. Enjoy the holiday season!
I‚Äôm so happy for you! She looks like she‚Äôs going to have an awesome Christmas! 
You‚Äôre an awesome parent. 
Happy birthday! 
ü§ó
Sweet looking girl !! 

Congrats on being such a good parent .

Super happy for her and you! She‚Äôs beautiful 
This cutie pies cutie powers are too strong.
She is beautiful!!!!!!!!!!!! 
She is beautiful.  What a milestone birthday.   May there be many more!
Thank you for posting this.  For some reason, I am feeling kind of down this Christmas season and this sure did a lot for me.  Thank you for sharing this.  I bet this won't be the only time that sweety surprises you.
She's beautiful. Im glad she has a caring parents and all the best luck in the future for her!
Happy Birthday OP's daughter! 
I am the proud aunty of a 48 year old spastic cp lady. She is the love of my life. As she grew she lost her mobility but kept her free spirit. Very opinionated. Loving. Gets her point across when she has something to say. She went everywhere I went when we were teenagers, even places that back in the 70's weren't "handicap accessible".
A piece of advice my sister was given many years ago about anything to do with my niece: let her tell you or show you what she is capable of before you let anyone tell you or her what she can't do. Including her doctors. They are all just 'practicing' medicine.
 And when she is 18, file all of the papers to "conserve" her. You will shake your head and decide you don't need to, until she needs to go to hospital and either can't or won't agree...
She is beautiful! You are blessed üíôüíúüíï
that‚Äôs awesome to see! she‚Äôs a cutie!
Hey! It‚Äôs my birthday too! Tell her happy birthday!! üéÇüéâ 
happy birthday! üéâüéÇ‚ù§
She is absolutely gorgeous! Congrats on her success and getting to see her physically act on that excitement <3
Oh how sweet! Happy birthday! Give her lots of hugs! That‚Äôs such a wonderful gift! :)
She is great. 
this is so sweet!! I hope she had a wonderful birthday! :)
Oh my gosh! She is adorable! Congrats on this milestone but it surely isn't her last. Happy Birthday sweet girl!
Beautiful!!!
Awesome. Happy birthday to the young beauty. Many, many hapy returns.
That is awesome! 
Could not up vote this fast enough.
She‚Äôs beautiful! I'm so glad she‚Äôs happy with her toyüòç
Your daughter is the most precious thing and I hope she has the best Christmas
She's an angel. Sending her lots of love and positivity to your family. 
Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday to your daughter!  Those little moments/milestones are unforgettable.   Best wishes to your family.  
This is so awesome. I wish her more of these moments every day, more for her, but selfishly for you as well.  Also HAPPY BIRTHDAY little one!! & I‚Äôm sure she knows there‚Äôs more coming with the holidays right around the cornerüôÇ
Sooo many hearts for this girl!!
If this isn't the sweetest thing I've ever seen.
Awesome!  Happy Birthday cutie!
She is beautiful. My 2 year old says "awww."
Woo! Happy birthday little one! It looks like you picked out a great toy!!!
Happy Birthday lovely lady! I hope you enjoy your new toy :)
You have a beautiful child.  Happy Holidays!
this is beautiful
üëèüëèüëè Yes babygirl, on your own tome at your own pace 
She seems to be enjoying herself! 
You got this, baby girl!
Happy birthday to this beautiful girl! I‚Äôm sure she is just loving it! This is hands down one of the purest things I‚Äôve seen in a long time. Thank you so much for sharing this. Happy holidays you all!
My daughter has my tonic dystrophy and this picture reminds me of her so much. She was virtually immobile until she was about 1.5. She didn‚Äôt walk until she was almost three. The very real sense of a door opening up for her every time she reached a tiny milestone will never be forgotten. 
So happy for your little girl!
This post warmed my heart. I wish you and your family a lifetime of love and happiness. 
I have a cousin with cerebral palsy, and she always shows my family the better side of the world. Shes awesome
Where would be the best place or charity to donate to your daughter and the families supporting? Want to make sure it gets to people like her and you.
I want to upvote this more.
I'm honestly and truly very happy for you. Thank you for sharing.
Awww, happy birthday to the princess!!!
She is too stinkin' CUTE! my best to you and your family. Thank you for sharing, and have a great holiday ‚ô•Ô∏è 
That‚Äôs awesome, man. ü§üüèª She‚Äôs doing her thing, that‚Äôs excellent 
Not gonna lie, she's a total badass, I hope she kicks life's ass :)
She looks like a beautiful and smart little girl, good on you for finding the perfect gift for her!
Wonderfully amazing!!! 
Happy Birthday sweetie! OK who's cutting onions around here!
Oh I had no idea that she had cerebral palsy when I first saw her. I just thought she was tired and leaning on the table. Adorable kid! 
Heart=melted.
You rock as a parent. Much to be proud of. 
Coolest thing ever! I would be proud of that determination.

Happy birthday to your beautiful girl and to you, too! 
She‚Äôs so cute!
I wish I could give this more then one internet point.  
Happy birthday, pretty doll. 
Our kids had that same toy. Our son who has autism loved it! He's 18 now.
Praises be!! This brings tears to my eyes!!! üíïüíïüíï
Your daughter is beautiful!  Peace and joy to you and your family! 
So adorable aww
Happy birthday
Cerebral palsy as far as i'm aware causes troubles with muscle development. What does it change for how you go on day to day. I know you can live a full, rich life, but not what challenges arise from CP. 
Awww I'm so happy she got something she likes and is excited about. Happy Birthday Sweetheart!
I have a sister with really severe cerebral pasly. It's amazing seeing you guys celebrating and showing such care.
Luv this absolutely adorable sweetheart...I have an elder brother with mild cerebral palsy and can say he is the best human a person can be...congrats to your Angel and am sure she will only make your prouder with time!
She is absolutely precious! Happy birthday to her!
This post made me so happy. You are lucky to have a girl to teach you so much and she is so lucky to have you! 
God Bless her and the rest of your family. thank you for sharing.
She's adorable üôÇ her hair is very pretty
She‚Äôs gorgeous.  And a fighter.   You must be so proud.   Sending so much love to you and her.
Speaking as someone who has a handicapped family member who has spent over 20 years constantly surprising and amazing the rest of us, who can truly say (especially at such a young age still) what is really going through her mind and the way it's still able to learn, grow and respond to things in her own unique way. The bottom line is that her heart-melting smile and those expressions on her innocent face coupled with eyes that have their own special light (okay, who's cutting onions in the room?!?) instantly tells me she's a gift from Heaven and a true Angel.

Prayers and holiday blessings sent to that adorable little girl and your whole family!
She's adorable and huge accomplishment getting to the toy!
My mom has CP and I know that the hardest part for her was feeling like her parents were ashamed to be out in public with her when she was a kid. Her mom always made her wear long sleeves and pants to hide her weak arm and leg, and was pretty awful to her. Just want to say that you're an awesome parent and I can tell your daughter isn't going to grow up feeling like that. Keep being great, she looks so happy! :)
This is amazing! Even your (or whoever's) dog thinks so too! I'm probably the only one who noticed that there's half of a dog on the left side of the first picture smiling proudly of his/her small human sister üòÅ
I dont know man but this made me cry manly tears.
She is absolutely precious! Happy birthday sweet girl!!
This is awesome! Have you guys ever done intensive therapy? I‚Äôm a pediatric PT in GA
God Bless this precious little lady
Beautiful.
I know you know this, but she's a beauty!
Happy birthday you sweet little angel.
That picture in the center bottom row, is indisputably, THANKS MOM AND DAD. God Bless You All. She's a beautiful child
That's Fantastic!!!   
A very happy birthday to her! (abet late! :)   
   

So awesome and there will be many awww moments to come
As much as these diseases sadden us it's really amazing to look back and see the positives in these situations and focus on what matters most. No matter what trials she faces I hope she grows up to be a great young woman and help change the world for better. And I hope she inspires others to see the beauty in what a person can offer no matter what roadblock is in their way 
She's super cute! Nice job with her present!
Awwww happy birthday sweet girl.  Enjoy your gift! 
Awww!  Happy birthday, kiddo!
I think your dog was feeling left out of the photo XD GL to your family, your daughters a little warrior <3
She's beautiful. My sister had CP from a mess up with forceps during delivery. Her twin did not make it. She has passed on now 2 years from neglect at her nursing home. I miss her always. I wish I gave her more time in her last year's. This world was not kind to my sister and I am so glad kids have so much more help these days. Cherish her every day. I know you will.
Awesome 
Your daughter is just beautiful.  When I first saw a toy like that at a doctor's office, I thought, no child will play with that....boy I was sooo wrong.  When I had kids, they couldn't wait to play with it.  I agree with everyone else, you'll see many great achievements in the future.  Bless you and many more blessings for your daughter's 4th year.
She's like "Woah there's a whole little world in here". What a great milestone!
She is a little badass! My best friend has a son with CP, it's all about the daily victories
Even with CP, she has the same curiosity in a new colorful toy like any other. She is adorable! Happy birthday little one!
I love this. Thank you for sharing your precious girl. She is so beautiful.
Rocking it girl!  Awesome job!
Lol that 3rd picture is just sheer amazement. Hahah love it
She's beautiful! What a wonderful milestone for her; that's amazing! 
This is awesome
And says a lot about her future abilities!!! Also, this is an amazing gift
For any child! I know you‚Äôre doing great as a parent!!!! 
I wish I could do a model shoot with her, she's cute as a doll. Happy Birthday Angel!
That‚Äôs awesome! We have a child with CP as well and it‚Äôs amazing seeing what they can accomplish despite the obstacles. 
Cutie. Bless her. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Happy birthday, you're a sweetheart. :) Have fun!
Happy birthday, sweet girl!! üéâüéâüéâüéâ
She‚Äôs amazing, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll continue to amaze you. Happy birthday!
This made my heart sooo happy üíöüíúüíöüíú
Fiance is 25 with cp, and has a pretty normal life. Good luck to your daughter! 
God, I used to LOOOOOOVE that toy when I was a kid. I actually started liking going to the dentist because he had one in his lobby. 
Happy Birthday!
Look at her go! When I was a baby I was about 4 months premature with CP, I vaguely remember going to physically therapy to learn how to walk, I had a plastic shopping cart I would push around everywhere and use it as a walker to steady myself. Looking at me now, 28, and with an average amount of muscle tone, I have made some incredible accomplishments in my life.


 I don't talk about this with anyone, but I felt like sharing, your little girl reminded me of how far I've come and how thankful I am to have 2 loving parents who adopted me, raised me, Took me to PT, and never once doubted me or what I could do.

 Never surrender.
What a smart little dumpling you have there! Sweet little gal, she knows what she likes. 
What a beautiful daughter. Merry Christmas.
What a cutie!
Cute kiddo! My better half has CP. Her parents were told she'd never walk or talk. She has a degree and walks most of the time with just a cane. Intensive physio and equine therapy helped a lot. What a great achievement for your little one. Always have hope!
Happy birthday!
Man this warms my heart
Happy birthday little one. I look forward to your future.
Big brother and long term caretaker of a CP affected kid, he's 18 and even though he doesn't talk, he constantly and consistently shows me a strength of personality that is moving and humbling. Embrace these moments.
I'm a little late but congratulations on your families special day.
Congrats on a great moment! 
I want/wish I could give you all the upvotes . I love seeing good stories and accomplishments like these. Share the joy, joy always hits me in my feels.
That's a world wide Aww... Not a personal one.

Happy Aww vibes from Australia
This is an aww that's definitely worth sharing.  You should be proud. 
Happy birthday!!!!üéä 
What a beautiful post!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh fuck , my heart
I had a bad day and this was the first thing that has made me smile.  Thank you for sharing.  üòä
That's awesome. That'll definitely be a favorite toy.
I love it. I have a 6 yr old who was born 4 mnths early, has cp and is developmentally delayed. He is pure joy and makes me so happy.  It makes you look at life differently. And the milestones they achieve that seem so small in the real world, gives us hope that our child understands or can improve their quality of life. It is hard to explain, but it's so joyous. Here is a video of my son who can't sit up by himself, walk or crawl, just all of a sudden pull himself up onto his tv stand to get closer and touch the characters he was watching.

One of my good friends in college has cerebral palsy.  It was only really relevant when he insisted on loading his wheelchair himself into someone else's vehicle.  Like, dude, you have a method and a system with your car, but the band kicks off in 20 minutes!  Let's go!  

The rest of the time, the only noticable difference was needing to walk a little slower with him on days he used the crutches instead.  I'm a fast walker, so this took a lot of practice to get the hang of.

Basically, awesome to see your kid getting on with figuring out how to manage herself.  If she's anything like my friend, she's got a lot more surprises up her sleeve.
That gift looks really cool.
Super cute little girl, but I want that toy!
She is pretty. Happy birthday, little angel! 
One of my colleagues has the same problem like her, now he can lead a normal life, so don‚Äôt worry about your daughter, God bless her
aomdwodme BLESS HER SWEET SOUL 
I hope she continues to enjoy it and finds more things that bring her that much interest and joy.
My brother has cerebral palsy and is in a wheelchair and can barely move. This is so cute and I love it so much. I wish you and your family the bestüòÅ
Very cool. I have found over the years those born "birth defects" (CP, Down Syndrome, etc.) are the most loving children/adults to be around. Give her a special kiss and hug. 
Happy birthday sweet girl. Wish you guys the best =)
happy birthday!
Amazing! 
She‚Äôs a cutie. I miss when my kids were that age. Now they‚Äôre 16 and I haven‚Äôt seen my son in years. Cherish the time. 
Shes so cute!!!!
Are there specific types of toys that are beneficial?  My two (one's the same age) are beyond blessed in the toy department and I'd be happy to send some in your direction.  DM me if I can help.
Awesome. I have lady in my neighborhood with cerebral palsy. She is amazing. I saw dance ballet in a talent show. It was magically since her body did movements I thought not possible. Plus she is the most positive person I've ever met.
Love this! My dad has CP! Took him 15 years to be able to walk without any sort of aid device but he was determined to do it. 

Children are amazing :) 
I used to work with special needs kiddos and the best advice I ever got from a parent was from the parent of a kiddo with cp. ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing wrong with their minds. They‚Äôre perfectly capable of normal thought. It‚Äôs just that their bodies have decided they don‚Äôt have to listen to them.‚Äù So please please share that with any teachers and paras that don‚Äôt know. Just in case. It will mean a huge difference in the way she‚Äôs treated, because they‚Äôll be able to really understand that any issues she might have with being nonverbal (if she has any) aren‚Äôt that she‚Äôs incapable of speech, but that her brain has moved on to the next thought already without her mouth having a chance to catch up!
Thanks for that heart warming moment at my morning. I liked these things as a kid too, totally get her fascination! ;)
What a doll. Hell of a job by her! 
The indomitable human spirit. She is wonderful!
Hey fam. 

I just became a foster parent yesterday to a child with cerebral palsy. He's extremely contracted and underweight, but he's the sweetest kid ever. Seeing this gives me hope for his future. Thank you for sharing. 
I don't blame her, it looks like a super fun toy!
Reason why I Reddit.
Oh, I always loved those toys! I'll bet she loves it too.
Ur dog seems a little exited about it to
She is absolutely adorable... You should be really proud of her!!! ü§ó
So cute!
So cute!
Love your way from a family in Nebraska 
Lovely!!!!
nice!!!
Thats awesome
The dog seems pretty happy about it too.
May I ask what the toy is that looks awesome.
Happy birthday to a very beautiful little soul ü§ó.
Yes! Look much she loves it! You're a good caregiver
Aww yay! She is precious!!! My daughter has special needs also and it's an amazing feeling when you see milestones like this! Hopefully your daughter continues to amaze you everyday! üòç
Hopefully it's mild and she grows out of her symptoms.

You have quite the challenging, albeit beautiful, task ahead of you.
Hbd
that is a super cool toy dad
That's awesome! I remember having a toy similar to that when I was about her age. I hope she continues to make gains and has an awesome birthday.
I'm crying here, you must be so proud of her.
She's adorable.
She is absolutely adorable 
That's absolutely lovely, Happy Birthday and I wish you all the best <3
I'm so proud of her üò≠
I love the interest in her eyes when she finally makes it there. She's in awe! Happy birthday to your sweet girl. <3 
No offense, but your daughter is an F‚Äôin BADASS! That kid‚Äôs determined and she‚Äôs going places! 
Wish I could put a million upvotes, this is Christmas

&#x200B;
Now i am both happy and sad 
All the best to you and the kiddo. :)
This is so sweet. The 5 platinum medals you've earned are really worth it. Hope she grows up strong and mighty! :)
Beyond beautiful, wishing her the best 
brought a tear to my eye
This melts my heart. Am glad she got something she really enjoys! Happy belated Birthday to your little one! <3
That's an awesome toy, and an awesome daughter you have man. Thanks for sharing her first of many big moments with us here at Reddit.
That's nice but why did you post this on Reddit?
What a wonderful child.  I am so pleased for her, and for you.  
What a cutie...
Aww that's sweet of you. Stay blessedüôÇ
this broke me and i hate children
imagine if the pics aren't OP's. That means he just got away with a bag full of platinums and golds
Likely to get lost in these thousand comments but I just had to say how incredible that is, she's a wee dote! Happy Birthday little one!
Awesome!! 
She is beautiful as a barbie doll . Happy birthday, pretty girlüç∞.
Happy birthday from Australia precious!!
The best is yet to come!
She's a darling! That toy looks amazing too! 
This is what living in hell must be like. 
She‚Äôs adorable and that‚Äôs a kick-arse bead maze!
This made me so happy, shes a miracle!! Happy birthday to her
My son has an underdeveloped cerebellum (Joubert syndrome).  He was globally delayed and not expected to walk or talk. He is now 22 and graduated  from college.  I'm just telling you that we don't know what these kids will be capable of someday. The "experts" told me my son would be very low functioning.  I'm now a speech pathologist basically because of my son's syndrome and no one can give you a reliable prediction of your child's outcome.  My son has ataxia and motor issues but he is academically competitive with his age matched peers. He walks and talks clearly too. He's taking driving lessons now. He's doing well.  I posted this because his diagnosis was cp until he was older. So similar.  I love your post! She brings you so much joy and there will be more gradual progress motorically  but she will keep gaining important skills. Hugs! Finally,  read to her and point to each word as you read it (passive sight reading) swipe left to right, each word, as you decode. When there's a picture,  talk about what's going on without including story details,  then say, "i don't know why that's happening.  I want to know too. We have to read the words to find out" this helps facilitate the desire to both read and understand content.  Literacy skill development will help her in so many ways i can't elaborate on right now. It may end up being a relative strength for her. Use closed captioning for movies and tv shows. You could work on helping her learn the letter names and their sounds in words. I will respond if you message me for more info. This post is so personal for me. Sorry for the wall. 
Top left, super proud doggo makes this a double-aww... Alas, I have but one updoot to give...
Shes adorable. Happy bday sweetie. My bro has criduchat so i kno some of the hardships ahead of you. Trust me tho there is a plethora of magical heart touching moments along the way. 
That's amazing, and you should be proud! She's beautiful! Happy Birthday!!!
That's awesome. I had that same toy as a kid, or similar at least, and it was my fav. She looks so happy, it's no wonder why you're proud. 
How do you like a post twice?
I also have a small sister. She is normal but the joy she brings. 

I truly understand your joy !! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
She's adorable, I hope she has a brilliant christmas.
Amazing photo and she is adorable. 
That does look like a cool toy
That‚Äôs some serious determination right there. This kid is going places, in more ways than one!
I can‚Äôt get over her sweet face! And the curiosity in those big bright eyes! 
Sweet baby!
Aww, she loves it! 
Happy happy birthday beautiful baby girl!!! 
üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
This is the sweetest thing I've seen all year. Bless her little heart ‚ô• 
Yay!! Congrats little warrior princess! And equipped with the face of an angel too! She‚Äôs just gorgeous! How could anyone not be proud of these first time accomplishments!! I‚Äôm proud of your little rockstar baby, and proud of you too OP-you seem like a fantastic parent, and I‚Äôm not one nor do I imagine I will ever be; but I am as aware as possible that parenting; even with the easiest, most well behaved totally healthy child is still the hardest job in the world. So while like any child she‚Äôs nothing but the biggest blessing ever; I can‚Äôt imagine the challenges that you and your baby face and overcome :) Congrats to both of you; and I hope and pray she will conquer every challenge and break barriers and live a happy life :) 
That‚Äôs awesome. Thank you for sharing with us
She looks like she is very excited about that toy! My son had one that was similar, and I remember all the little gadgets on it. So many fun things to keep the excitement going! I hope she has a lot of fun and a great birthday! 
Awesome!!  She is beautiful. Thanks for sharing...made my day. 
Beautiful little angel! Merry Christmas, peace, joy, and happiness!
I work with a coworker that has cerebral palsy. He is a research biologist and looks through a microscope 90% of the day. If she grows up and likes science, that could be an awesome career for her. 
Awesome 

‚ù§Ô∏è
Well this made me emotional.

Take care and merry Xmas!
your pup looks equally excited in pic 1
I dont blame her that thing looks magical!
Awwww congratulations!! I'm so happy for y'all!!!
Well done!! She's a strong girl ‚ù§
What an adorable child. 
I will always remember a girl with CP I tutored Calculus to in College; she was bright, always happy;  and me - kinda bohemian, scared the crap pout of her conservative east indian mother - which also gave her delight because otherwise she did not really get away from her parents much.  But she enjoyed the tutoring, so he mother let it continue.
Dude u made me cry :(
Super cute!!  Good for her!!
Yay for her!!! Celebrate all the victories, big or small. They all count ‚ù§Ô∏è
What a pretty little doll baby! I hope you had a wonderful day princess üòç

Happy belated, little angel! 
So cute! Congrats! üíï
That is amazing and she's beautiful! My daughter and I are impressed! 
Bless her little heart
Take good care of her, little princess
I didnt read the title first 
 Happy bday, small princess 
 

Great article! It seems like she's at the best age to start now! I have no disabilities, just a lazy eye but my lack of depth perception does make some things difficult. I can't catch anything unless I stand to the side of the ball's trajectory and I have a bad habit of slamming my cups onto the table because I think it's farther away (embarrassing in fancy restaurants). 3D movies also don't work :/
Someone posted your picture and all I can is this is the most cheerful thing I saw today. 
Props for the parenting of the child.


But you commited a crime by having a child.

Took the gamble because you felt like it and look what happened.

I'm sure she is a great person, who you doomed to suffer.
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL!  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO HER!!!
Just curious, what caused her cerebral palsy?
Tell her I love her. She will be great. She is the light of the earth. I miss my sister. Appreciate this angel while you can.
She's beautiful. Congratulations for her big victory!!!
Aww she's absolutely adorable. :) 
Oh cool it's my birthday too today! Happy birthday!!!!

Happy birthday sweet girl! My little guy turns 1 this weekend and the time is flying way too fast. Enjoy every moment with her! Keep it up, you all are doing amazing. Love from an internet stranger!
That‚Äôs wonderful!  The fighting spirit!  Whatta gem.
Congratulations! She‚Äôs a cutie!
Felicidades e Sa√∫de from S√£o Paulo, Brazil.
Aww that's fantastic. I had a toy just like that when i was her age and i remember loving it. <3 stay strong, as someone with cerebral palsy (although a ridiculously case) the love and pride parents like you, and my own mom, show is humbling. 
Absolutely adorable. Happy birthday, pretty girl! ‚ù§Ô∏è
That dog in the first panel is very proud too!
She is so beautiful!

Happy birthday to your little girl!

Beautiful. One of my favorite students at the college I work at has cerebral palsy. He‚Äôs the most positive and uplifting young man I‚Äôve ever met. Looks like your daughter is on that same determined and wonderful path.
This is so adorable! What is the toy called if you don‚Äôt mind me asking. I‚Äôve been looking for something like this but don‚Äôt know what keyword to search. 
That's wonderful! Celebrate every gain!
All the feels such a cutie!!
She's adorable ‚ù§ 
YAS BABY GIRL. happy birthday sweety üíú
Congrats. I have an 18 month old that seems to bring a tear to my eye for the simplest things. This is absolutely wonderful and I can not imagine the feeling that swept over you.
