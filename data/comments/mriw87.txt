"My children do not have enough legs, but they are handsome and strong."
I wish I knew the story behind this.  That cat mama is serious about those chicks
That cat is tucking that chick under her belly just like a real hen lol
Tell me about it. We live by a small pond in southern Florida. We have had Muscovy ducks produce several broods of between 9-12 chicks each time. The hawks and herons killed all of them every time, until last autumn when 7 survived. Nature can be brutal.
Hawk?

Fun fact: About 80% of all ginger cats are male, as there are far less variables involved. Also, ginger males can come from red, calico and tortoiseshell mothers, whereas females need to have one fully red father and the mother will have to be red, calico or tortoiseshell.

Aww-dorable
These are my kittens, their fur is weird and they walk on two legs, but they are mine and I love them.
What came first, the cat or the egg?
r/AnimalsBeingBros It knows what's up and being protective. She has my upvote.
“These are *my* chicken nuggets! Get your own.”
**THE CHICKIN PROTECTOR**
Cat will tear bird a new poophole if he tries to hurt the chicklets

My name is Catto, chicks must protect,

From strange figure, on top of deck.

Chicks crawl out, must push them back in,

Shadowy bird may do a big sin.
That cat is going through momma hormones to do this
What's scientific explanation of this selfless behavior?
*these are* **my** *chicken nuggets*
“Don’t ever talk to me or my sons again”
Plot twist: it’s the mother of the chicks on top of the roof
Get you own chicken strips, you scavenger!

In her defense, they’re all cute, fuzzy blondes :3
Goodest kitty❤
Reminds me of the Tom & Jerry episode with the ducklings 😄
I can picture, if this was a movie, ending in an epic gunfight
amazing lol
Who messed up with the cat's settings?
She’s actually saving them for later and knows that live food doesn’t spoil.
u/paigesam91
this is how i am with my chicken nuggets too with other people around
Dumb observation, but the predator vs prey eye position popped out to me here. A bird from a different direction could totally grab that wandering chick without being seen.

Also, cats would look super derpy with prey positioned eyes.

You can thank my weird brain for these revelations.
I LOVE the way she glares at that bird!
Stay back human! These are my snacks!
Stay inside!!

Such a good mama! 💕
Ooor it’s saving it’s meal… 😳
Cat protecting birds while wanting to eat birds, how adorable!
I assume the cat is just “looking after” them like how we fatten up chickens for winter..
I just love cats so much. So capable of literally just going YES THIS IS ALSO MY BABY AND I WILL PROTECT IT
never thought I’d see the day when cat protects it’s food!!
It's probably trying to protect its breakfast, but this is Reddit - where cuddly feelings > logic
This my MMMYYY dinner!!!!

Saving snacks for later
Everyone sees a cat protecting those baby chicks from a predator hawk.

I see a cat protecting its chickie nuggies from getting poached from someone else at the table.
These are MY chicki nuggies!
Interesting that she knows that bird is a predator to those chicks. I doubt she’d be as concerned if those were kittens instead.

Instead of downvoting, someone educate me. Someone knowledgeable, preferably.
Territorial mama
Cat: That's my food!
The rare female orange tabby.
Cat needs to have its ass kicked by mama.
The fascinating thing here is that the tucking motion the cat used? Mother hens do it exactly like that. Pretty cool.
I hate people who don’t share their snacks.
She’s just saving them for supper.
Potential food source.
I love it
What a good Momma
Gotta love mother cats
"Joey doesn't share"
Best quality pocket snack
He's just keeping for dinner.
I think this cat is broken
The most curious thing about this to me is how the cat knows to perceive the crow as a threat to the chicks?

Surely crows don't prey upon kittens do they?
Are you sure she’s not being protective of her food
Of course he is, they grow into food!

Lol.  Cat is like “Kevin get the FUCK back in there”
I’m in love with her overbite .  It makes her look extra wary of any threat to her babies. 🤗🤗🤗🤗
Pfft, cat is using those things as bait for the real prize.
"mommy it's so sunny outside tod..." 
-shhhhh stay under me
That cat has patience to wait for a full meal not just chicken nuggets.
Ears in protective mode.
These are my snacks! Not yours!
Is "chicks" codeword for "lunch"?
Theres actually about a 75% chance this cat is male, given that its coat color is orange.

NO!    MY LUNCH!
Always protect your future food resources
Animal intelligence. The cat knows the bird is only a threat to smaller animals, like those baby chicks, so she's very vigilant about them.
And yesterday my boss showed me a video of a hen roosting on four kittens.
/u/savevideo
That cat definitely has the “Fuck around and find out” vibe to whatever is up on that roof.
Love this!!! Upvote a thousand times over!!!
Cats like no way im sharing my dinner!
100% chicken cat
Protective or hoarding food?
These are my nuggets.
All I see is a cat bird watching.
Reminds me of my cat with my bunnies. Whenever I opened the cage to feed the rabbits, my cat (who was a recent mother) would immediately groom them.
From whom is she protecting them?
what a precious little one
I have a male cat that looks just like this cat.  I know that he would do the exact opposite of what she is doing - those babies wouldn’t stand a chance from him.  But, this is extremely interesting...  Thanks for posting it!

Our cat is protective of his food too
One of those baby chicks has no arms :(
Combine this with the one where the hen is protecting the kittens and then take the average.
cat is looking to feed that bird to its chicklets
I’m surprised that they didn’t get eaten

Real question, does they think about it as their kitten? Or does they think about it as their pet?
Got to let those nuggets ripen.
Cuuuuute!!❤️❤️❤️
It’s Oliver!
Don’t come near my lunch
Like me with chicken nuggets around my kids.
I’ve worked as both a zoologist and nature photographer for a while, someone said this bird was a Jackdaw but I doubt it, my guess would be quail hawk. If you look really close at the tail you can see it’s a little spreaded, jackdaw’s don’t have that. This is quite easy to see when in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer’s table.
I’m amazed mum understands that a bird (normally cat prey) is a threat to her babies. 

Are these birds normally a threat to kittens?
My lunch!  ***Mine!***
Or just saving them for later
Oown!! It’s too adorable 🥰
This is my dinner, go find your own!

This is better parenting than I've seen from a lot of humans.
This is a smart cat with a heart of gold.
Doesnt wanna share dinner
That cat looked like it would fight Francis Ngannou at the drop of a hat
Wow! It learned to grow its own food!
I love seeing animals that adopt other species ... especially when humans can’t learn to get along with others of the same species.
ima give this helpfull award
I'm the same way when protecting my dinner.
Cat would fuck that bird up lol
this cat is probably shit scared knowing that the lives of these chicks are at huge risk. then there's this subreddit going "awww! so cute"
"Don't worry, babies. I will get us bird for dinner."

Male chicks are killed right after birth as they are deemed useless by the egg industry. Go vegan.

As a cat owner, I would fear that cat. It's got that 'I will fuck you up' look.

I never stopped to think that they can also be eaten by the bird.   Not the other way round.
That cat knows that birds don't fuck around.
Why did I think it ate the chicks 🤣
💕💕💕
My heart!

How adorable 🥰
Aww, my dog ate my chicky :(
I had doves build a nest, lay eggs which subsequently hatched into these beautiful little birds right on my doorstep.

The nest was empty when I checked last. Wondering where the babies could’ve gone, I checked my security cam. Turns out there were 3 crows circling the nest and took the babies with the poor parent trying to ward them off. :(
She booped it back under her!
Reminds me of that cat on an Irish farm that mothered some Ducklings because she had just given birth to kittens at the same time. Incredible to see.
Damn, she is ON GUARD DUTY! Love it.
