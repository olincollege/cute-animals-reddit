I’m sorry but I’m going to have to steal your mum
may i have like 5 of those? ty
Your mom is such a talented and thoughtful woman. I want to have that as my travel cardi.
“My mom made this for me, And it was promptly stolen”

Found your mum lol
Do she just make cardigans? I’d love a beanie from that material!
Can your mom adopt me
Using Pantone's colours of the year? Very trendy!
You are soooooooo lucky !!!!!
I feel comfy just looking at it!
So what if you've grown a moustache... You're still her baby. 😘😘 Anybody with a mother or mother in law like that would be lucky.
 *A man walks down the street in that hat (coat?), people know he's not afraid of anything.*
Love your work mum!
That looks so cozy!  Is yarn like that machine wash safe?
Beautiful dude, cool Mum.
I'll take your entire stock
*“YoU’lL gRoW iNtO iT”*
Followed the Instagram and can’t wait to get one of these! Since I have the ear of the designers son....tell your mom if there’s the option to add a mechanism to close the cardigan for a 360 degree hug I’d be even more obsessed. Maybe toggle wood buttons.
Hey, man. Leave some girls for the rest of us. Much swag.
Ok, you’ve said mum and your garden looks Britishly wet, does that mean for once something on Reddit will be UK based?! Already followed on Instagram, this is exciting!!
I looked inside the hood & I thought I saw Gus Johnson.
That thing is badass.  I would wear it proudly.
You have a very kind and sweet mum, sir!
This will be couture in a few years — bet!
And suddenly I want a nap
She’s our mom now
I know hypebeast would spend $3,000 if it said balenciaga but too bad its priceless ☺️
Aww, your mom's nice.
Love this! I’m following on Instagram, can’t wait for the shop to be up and running
Idk y but I smiled while reading mum instead of mom
How many skeins did that take? Looks so soft and big but I know those balls dont last long lol
That is awesome and so is your mom!
Omg can I have one!!

Edit: ignore this - just found the answer with the IG page!
I love the colors. At first glance they remind me of a blue and gold macaw.
Are you a knight who says knit?
Omg i neeedddd itt, omg can ur mom make one for me ?? I mean not free but i will pay her like 1 miljioen dollors :)
From the looks of it, your mum is about to make a ton of money! Is she planning on shipping to the States?
Lucky git!
This is fantastic and I want like 5. Given your mum an Insta follow - excited to see it on sale!
I can tell from your facial expression. :)
She used Pantone’s colors of the year. Chic!
This is EXACTLY the kind of garment I need for those cold early mornings, definitely giving the Insta a follow. Well done to you for promoting it, and your Mum for creating it!
Makes me wish I could knit. I crochet really well, but struggle with knitting. I tried. 

That's awesome.
Honestly that's the best thing I've ever seen
You should post in r/crochet
Its so cozy!
Your mum is gonna be very busy if she's seriously gonna sell these. I'll take two!

Edit: I'm already following her insta.
I thought it was a bird costume. (Is it?)
R/streetwear lol
[deleted]
One word: jealous
That shit looks cozy as fuck! Is she selling them?!

Edit: She is! Let me add this to the wishlist.
This is awesome. I would have worn this all quarantine to feel comforted
Sweet Jesus, where is she, the land of the giants? LMAO. Those knitting needles have to be the size of baseball bats! :)  And I want one!
did a grown ass man just post a pic of himseof on r/aww?
I hate to be that person, but I just want to warn everyone that knits like these do not last long. The reason it is so chunky and soft is that it is straight roving and not yarn. Yarn is roving fibers twisted into strong, elastic and durable strands. Roving is an unfinished product that has no structure or support. It will stretch, fray and collect dirt and grime. It's very cute as giant knitted blankets and sweaters like this, but it is also very expensive and will not last long.

 Here's a video for more information. https://youtu.be/DroelB2uwx4
A man walk down the street in that outfit and people know he’s not afraid of anything.
Love it!
I’m Loving it !!!!!
real
adorbs!
Strong borrower vibes.
"Don't worry, you'll grow into it." Says every mum
Your mum loves you very much, it's gorgeous 💗
I just picture your mum as being married to the giant that lives up the top of Jack’s beanstalk.
Holy crap, what the hell is this?! 😳

You look like a Pokemon or.... Something. 😄

OK, jokes notwithstanding, looks very comfortable!
Cherish it FOREVER
Will us Canadians be able to purchase? I need one!!!
But you look cute though,  not the concept 🤣
Adopt me.
This is a great fashion moment made with mother's love
That looks amazing
When you get to the link, if you don’t post it, please message it to me as well. You look very snuggly and warm. The colors are great.
You seem like an absolute joy and so does your mom. I also need 10 of these 😆
 would wear ten of those at once. Lookin' cozy 💛
Does she have a pattern she’s willing to sell?
Is there a special name for the super thick yarn used to make this?
Damn, that looks warm.  Pretty fly my dude.
I would feel safe even in the middle of a battle if I'm wearing this
Is it warm and snug though? Cuz if so I’ll take 10, if not I’ll take 9
Will you be shipping internationally?
You look like Mr. Beast
This is amazing! Any idea if your mom would be willing to ship to the US once she gets her shop up and running? I definitely want one!
Wow ! She made sure you'll never be cold !!  Give her extra hugs from us !
Tell your mom she needs to open a Etsy account or something, because a lot more people would really like to buy something like that. A lot more people than just instagram.
The cuddlygan, just by the name it’s gonna sell itself :) I’m in! Plz make sure she will deliver worldwide. It’s freezing in Germany man!
Tell your mum I want one too!
I am saving this post so i can show my mom and hopefully get one made for myself😃🤗 I love those colors too
Snug as a bug on a rug
Literally said “awww” out loud when I saw this! That’s a super cozy looking hoodie, wish I had one.
We're reaching "Bug in a Rug" levels of snug!
That is amazing.  It looks so soft and warm, perfect for cold winter nights.
A runway model could wear that and it would sell for thousands of dollars.
Your mom made you a wearable hug! I love it.
Oh wow it's like a hug you can wear I'm so jealous!
I am so tempted even though this totally clashes with everything in my closet. It looks so comfy!!!
Never heard of or seen hand knitting before.  For a bit I was wondering if you'd somehow photoshopped a much smaller knitted item onto the photo. :)
My mom made me tons of great sweaters. She's been gone 15 years now, but one of them is so wonderful that I pull it out whenever I have a cold or the like and she is back hugging me. 

She also made me two Icelandic Lopi yarn sweaters. The yarn for her was costly, but maybe $40 US when she bought the yarn. They now sell in Reykjavik for $239 and $259 US. 

I looked at OP type yarn for a throw and it is pricey. Cherish and take care of whatever your dear mom makes you!  I think it is wonderful!
Does your mum sell the pattern? I want to make one!
A big gray / yellow hug with sleeves - love it!
What naps may be enjoyed in that sweater. ♥️
Can she make me one as well?
Your mom made Lenny Kravitz’s scarf too didn’t she?
Dang, I think I have to ignore that stache and date you long enough to steal that
You'd have to pry that thing off my cold, dead body. I'd wear it everywhere. To work, to bed, in the shower.
Damn that’s tite!! I want one!!
Very cozy looking! What shoes are you where tho?
Will pay 💰for one of these
THATS what I need to make myself for working from home! Gets quite cold during the day. I have to look into making something similar.
Omg please tell your mom I’d like one as well, please and thank you💛
Where get
Oh man, what a beautiful start you have here!!! I'm so excited for the future of you and your mom's cardibusiness. 😄❤❤❤
Omg yes!!!
That's the most gangster shit. I love it.
That thing probably costs a fortune to make... :) That stuff is extensive. My mom knits stuff. Knitting is for fun, not to save money.

Looks snuggly as hell though ;)
Pedguin??
I thought it was bumble bee style at first cause the branch behind your head and that made it 1000 times cuter but this is still cute and your mom is adorable. Also you look happy as FUCK all snuggled in there
Can she make me one 👉👈
You look like you're about to do a sick freestyle on Sway's Universe.
Is your dad a Borrower?
You don’t have a mom u have an Angel literally from heaven!
okay, as a knitter, I know that yarn isn't TOO heavy, but I gotta ask, HOW MUCH DOES THIS FREAKIN' THING WEIGH???
This should be in r/cozyplaces lol
Nice drip bro 😎
I need this in my life. Start her up an Etsy store!
I hand knit a blanket it’s really fun and I recommend people try it
Your mom is my mom now.
OMG. This is amazeballs!!!
I'm not sure if she loves or hates you.
How big were the needles? Is your mum a giant?

&#x200B;

 also.. your  mum is way better than my mum.
I love your Mom.
A man walks down the street wearing a coat looks like that, people know he ain’t afraid of nothing.
I would really like to have this suit of armor!!
Can she make me one too?!
Thicc
Dope! I want one!
Your mustache says you must be an adult. But the vibe I'm getting is a happy little kid on Christmas morning! You have a lovely mother and you know it. So wholesome.
Gosh I really had tears come to my eyes when I first saw this. 

I make stuff for my kids all the time, and they're little now so they always love it, but Ive wondered if once they're big and manly and have beards if they'll roll their eyes secretly and politely say thank you and throw it in the trash because who wants dumb mom stuff? Idk 

Anyway, look how much he loves it, I hope my boys still will too
I zoomed in and saw how happy you looked and actually said, maybe too loudly-  "awww".

Whatever, no shame - it makes me feel good that you feel good.


Apart from that, your mom has skills, I don't know much about knitting but I do know the gauge of the yarn is dwarfed by the gauge required for the pins, and that's thick-ass yarn, so she must have had to wrestle that beast into submission with a couple 2x4's or lamp posts.

Says quite a bit about her upper body strength and dexterity.
A gigantic knit hug! Gorgeous and brilliant at the same time! Mum rocks!
WHAT ARE THOSE!?
 Bro, can I get one?
fuck that looks so comfortable
Lookin fly as macklemore
Can she start selling these? I’m serious I would definitely buy these!! So awesome!
Dude, you look so cozy. I want to watch a 3 hour movie in the couch with that.
Gunna cuddle right in there with you!
Thats sooo cute! My bf is a good knitter, he knitted his grandma a scarf. And then I asked him thar he should knit me a beanie, and that unfinished beanie has been in the closet for months now.
You look all snuggly.

We’re all wicked jealous of you. But you know that.

This is perfect for those of us dealing with a plague-ridden winter with added insurrection and social isolation.
Super dope
Wow. Okay. Thanks for making me jealous.
can she make another?
Dude that thing is 🔥
Judging by the comments, I think you're mum needs to go into business. :) It looks super comfy.
Give your mama a hug .. she is the best!
The level of love in it can be felt
Would love to see it spread out so y mom can make me one if thats possible.
That looks amazing!
That looks like the coziest sweater ever created.
I want one !! Your mom rocks
THAT LOOKS AO COZY OMG!!!
The statement "I love you" has been knitted into existence. :)
Cherish her always!
Shut up and take my money
But what is it?
This is so cute aaaaaaaa *die*
Yer Mum is a Boss! She needs to be selling those bad boys online!
That is so cool that she made that
Your mom is an awesome creative!  And love your name too!!
This will be oversized for me but I DONT GIVE A DAMN
Is it the absolute most warmest thing you've ever worn? Because it certainly looks like it is!
Where get
Your mum is a massive legend.
Awww u look so cute. I want one so I can give hugs to people 🥺
Its snuggle time!
Not kidding - does your mum sell these?  I need this in my life SO MUCH!  Edit: Found the Etsy link below, please ask her to take orders! :)
That is such a mum love gift. Keeping her boy warm. So sweet and caring.
Is this normal yarn and you are the size of a Ken doll?  Seriously though, this looks awesome and I would love to have one.
What is that, velvet? That’s niiiice
Your GF will steal that from you.
Meanwhile...

Mum: son, have a sad news for you. you're adopted!

Son: mummmmmm! pleaseeeeee!! so, who is your actual son??

Mum: the **commenter**. (it's me)

P.S. now you know the rest of the story xD
Imagine posting yourself on r/aww. Gimme a break bud
She’s the mom Reddit didn’t know we needed. I’ll take 2. Is she taking adoption requests?
Looks warm&cozy...your mum must be very talented!
Beautiful cardigan!
I’m jealous!
Thats awesome I'm jealous
You look like a parrot!  Nice job, Mum.

It looks so cozy n comfy teddy like
Can they be shipped to India?
Ah, it looks super cozy! ❤️ I don't have an Insta, but I'd love to know when she's ready to take orders.

How warm does it get?
She must've used bean poles for needles...
10/10 would buy.

Just imagining sleeping in that on a cold wintery night gives me cozy warm feelings.
Absolutely Fabulous!
IANAK (I am not a knitter) - what the heck is that material?  It looks like knitted anchor line.
Does she make scarves too! I could really use one of [these](https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+players+giant+scarf&rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS771US771&hl=en-US&biw=375&bih=640&sxsrf=ALeKk01fps7rz7_06i9ATdwP-no5A2WUOg:1610024646283&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwim0fmY8YnuAhWhGFkFHd-VDfwQ_AUI6wYoAA#imgrc=6PrWdDlcC4wNXM).

Your mum rules
Wow!!! I want one!!!
She's our mum now
As a very warm natured person who generally overheats in temps above like 50 degrees. . . I'm jealous.
Yeah, need one now!
if you wash this too hot and it felts up it might be able to stop bullets
Kerwin frost would fuck with this
Can your mom be my mom and give me a giant snuggle blanket too?
I am officially now up for adoption
r/crochet would love this
I could live in that
Hi, it's me, your long lost sibling! Can you ask mom to make me one too?

Cool Mom.
Aw, lucky!
My son’s girlfriend made a blanket for me out of the same type of yarn and it is the cuddliest thing I’ve ever owned. I love the idea of a sweater!
Can she make me one as well? It looks so pretty and comfy
That looks so cozy!
Valteri Bottas??

I want one. Now.
Your mum FUCKING loves you
Omg! I would never take it off, it's like a hug you can wear.
Looks like it's made of Cheetos.

Cue people bitching about you still getting gifts from your mom

Like, come on people.
I want to do drugs and cozy up in one of those.
Looks super comfy. You'd be brave to wear that out in public though.
That's cozy af

Wow fits perfectly fine 😃
Maya the bee is that you?

Love it! Does she have a pattern for it?
That looks so unbelievably comfy!
Oh my God - I want one!!!

Is your mom single?
I'm jealous.
That looks cozy AF. I’m jealous.

Does your mom use those enormous needles for this, or just PVC pipe? (I’m serious. I’ve seen the latter.)
I would actually love to have one of those for taking my dog out for a pee or smoking a joint outside. Looks great
How much do you want for it!?
Omg I want one!
Too bad it’s not all yellow.  You could be the new, “Cuddlygan for scale” on reddit.
[How's it sit? Pretty cunning, don't you think? ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN49TDIY-Sk)
Is she selling? That’s amazing.
Epic!
God you are cute
Grizzlies fan?

Your mum sure loves you.
Go say thank you again. All that yarn had to be expensive af! This came out looking so great.
That's so fashionable too, wow
Is there love in every stitch? Does it come with a cookie-eating hat?

Oh, it looks so cozy!

A little jealous...
If I am being honest I am still not sure knitting is real. I mean I hear about it, seen it in movies..but this is some of the first solid proof.
Can she make one for me?
Bro that looks so warm and I want one.
That is super cool and one loving mother...
THATS AWESOME
I want one soooo bad now
Reddit: Love your sweater!
Me: I like your stick collection.
This guy out there living my dream.
I want one. The sweater and your mom
r/knitting or r/crochet ?
I don’t know what it is, but I’m pretty sure I need one.
You better give your mother lots of hugs and kisses, mister.
Bro, tell your mom I'm up for adoption.  She'll instantly have 3 grandkids!
Good for you having a mum who cares
She should sell these! Love ❤️
Mine could not give a shit less lol

Oh hey it’s Billie Eillish
Big round of applause for your mum :) knitting is fun but using wool this thick is a labour of love for sure

[deleted]
She’s the best!

Moms are the best. Mine used to knit and she make me the most beautiful scarfs and pillow cases.
You look like Stuart Little in a sweater Mrs Little made for him.
Your Mom needs an Etsy page!!!
Are you 9 inches tall?
It's so fluffy!
Your mum is to be treasured
You *need* matching pants.
Well now I need one.

Looks like snuffalufagus is in the process of eating big bird
scarf? blanket? or Cuddly throw?
Cmon streetwear!
She must love you
She made a Hug you can take anywhere...and you look great too!
I'm slightly jealous
My great grandma made a blanket like that before she died a couple years ago
Where the hell do you get such a thick wool/ yarn (whatever that is, I don't know the terminology) I bet my mom would make something amazing from this as well.
Is that bernat blanket yarn? I feel like I live in the yarn section at work. It gets sold out so quickly now I know why!
Ok Gus Johnson
Can she make me one?
I had something similar but I didn’t like it because of the holes. I’m picky yes but I didn’t want the cold to breach the warmth.
The cardigan looks amazing! I love the raccoon (?) in the background too.
I am soooo jelly omg looks soo cozy
That’s so wonderful!
I'd totally sleep in that..
That looks like the comfiest thing ever created.
That’s BANGIN
That looks hella cozy
Mums are just the best. This looks amazing and I am seriously jealous!
That looks snuggly as fuckly
I'm not even sure what this is, but I'll take 2.
I’m full of envy!   It’s beautiful
Looks like a giant hug 🤗
Man i wish i had that
Where is the order sheet and price list??
This is so wholesome
So Micheal Che was right, white women love yarn .... jk very nice

Tell your Mom she's awesome! That looks sooooo cozy!
Oooohhhh....I use Etsy.....I'll be keeping my eyes out for one I have a few family members (plus myself) that would love one......please let her know she has a wonderful talent. Thank you.
I think she made it for your whole family
This is high fashion

Is your mum single?
It’s freaking awesome!
Beautiful! That sweater, your mum and your smile! Gold stars all around!
For a second I thought you were Guys Johnson...
De Boquita papa !!! 💙💛
I think Bob Mortimer wore one of these in one of his stories.
That is awsome
This may be one of the best things I’ve ever seen. Honestly. Also, the craftsmanship!
Lucky Man.....Might hv been a WOW moment...fr mom son duo.👍
definitely on reddit
Looks so cozy!

Understated elegance
You’re mom is an absolute treasure
Awww it’s so cute :3 Question: How much does it cost? And what sizes do these comfortable things come in?
I NEED THIS!❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍❤️😍
Wow would 100% buy this.
Shit!!  Can your mom make that for me?
Your mum loves you very much.
That looks so cozy!! ❤️
Are taking on the role of Mr. Peanut??
Shut up and take my money!!
My mom only makes me black eyes
This is fantastic! Do the colours have personal relevance?
Anyone else think that tree branch was supposed to be an antenna?
I’d give her a big hug just like that.  I mean, you should give her a big hug. I don’t know your Mom.
Sorry, are you u/ClaireyCS ‘s son? Or did you just take the picture from their profile? Their picture is 20 hours old and yours is 3 hours.
that is wonderfully cozy !
i want one?????
Want!
I have! Been thinking on doing something like this for me!! Full body too!  

Your mom is a keeper!! Lol!
Warm and cuddly.
Please um can you ask your mom if um she can make one for me too maybe?
You have an awesome mum!
😭 this is so cute!
I’d wear this. 100%. Where do I place an order with her?
That is some thick yarn. Impressive
Aaaaaaah SHIT. That looks comfy as HECK!
This looks like it could be sold by Ralph Lauren for £5000

Looks so bloody cozy
Love itt!!!!!
Wow 
That looks heavenly....

Your mom is one of the best, you are very lucky. 

I miss my mom everyday.
Looks warm...does she take orders???
Looks even more cozy than a snuggie!
I need to start working with this chunky yarn. A scarf would be done in 10 minutes
Dude, that's so rad.
That's cool. I want one.
I have a sweet mom, too. May your mum be my aunt, please?
Duuuude that’s bomb!
Baller
You fkn cutie
This looks legit like the comfiest thing I’ve ever seen LOL
Ok I thought you had antenna coming out of your head, like it was a giant insect costume. The blankie is cool but THAT would have been even cooler! PS your mom rocks
So you should wear it!
Everybody wishes they had a mum like yours!!!
Thank you on behalf of all mums for showing your sincere appreciation.🥰🤩😙
You'll grow into it.
Nice sweater! Did your MAMA make it for you?!




^^^how ^^^sweet
Can she make me one???
if you sink me into water I shall become more heavy than you can possibly imagine
That looks cozy as fuck
This is the kind of content I needed right now.  Thank you.
I love it!  Can she adopt me?
Now I want one too
Beautiful
Your ma is a boss! Love it! 

Does she like soaps, lotions and hand sanitizer? Bath & Body Works has a scent called Sweater Weather. Got some for Christmas, smells nice.
I'm jealous
Omg, the snuggle is *real*.
You now resemble a finger puppet.
But....will she make me one....credit cards ready...
As a Hufflepuff, WANT.
Tifu by showing this to my wife and now she wants one.. do you take orders? xD
Don’t you need giant knitting sticks to make those?
Omg does she have a pattern? I wanna learn
I didn't know they made yarn that thick, that's pretty dope
Amazing
I feel you should go out and fight crime in that. Call yourself Mama's Boy, maybe get a logo embroidered on the front (or ask your mom to add it) lol.

Seriously, looks very cozy!
Wow. That is incredibly ridiculous. But it looks just as comfy! I'd rock it.
I think that is just the cutest! My mother knits me hats and cowls all the time and I cherish every single one.
That. Looks. So. Comfortable. Can. I. Get. One?

At first I thought you looked like Gus Johnson. At a quick glance you kind of do!
I thought you were a bird!
I want that. Is it from Wool and Gang ?
I NEED THAT!
Can we at least get a tutorial on how to make one?
🥰
She have a store???
Is your mom adopting?
I’m insanely jealous
Damn. Now I want one.
That looks so warm and cozy! Aww
Zach? Is that you?
Comment
I see she’s up to date on Pantone’s 2021 colors...
Must be unbelievably comfy! And awesome mum
That looks so damn warm... your mom is awesome

Well what your mom phone number so she can made me one 🥰
That looks so cozy! I want to make one now.
Dope. I need your mom to send me one! ;]
That looks like the humming bird guy.
I wish I had a mom like that. But she's gone mentally and emotionally due to severe psychological problems that have persisted for years. She's also an ex alcoholic. On top of that she's very mean and toxic. So I essentially only have my father left. I wish I could do more for my dad. 😔🙃

Omg it's so cute!
I know that is the most comfortable thing ever
Can I have one?
Damn, I'm jealous as hell.
Will it ship worldwide? I want one sooo bad!!
Just brings this scene to mind: https://youtu.be/tNmKyMl0088
Ahh that looks so dang comfy! Glad you have a mom that makes things like this for you!! So cute
 ould you ask your mother what the name of the yarn she used to make it? I would like to buy it that my partner wants to make a similar one.
That's actually really cool
Could she also make me one? I’ll pay
That looks like what a mother's-hug-when-you're-at-your-lowest feels like
I know pretty much nothing about knitting, what material is that made of?  Is each strand of fabric like half an inch wide?
That is one drippy piece you got there!
Ugly
Either you are 3ft high or she used enormous yarn and needles. No disrespect at all, I think the cuddlygan could be the next big thing. It looks amazing - perfect comfort item for online school kids hunched over their laptops.
Is that an antenna coming out of the hood or a branch in the background? Either way nice job dude’s mom.
That looks like the most comfortable piece of clothing I've ever seen.
Omg! I want one!
You're so lucky! that looks so comfy! your mum is a gem, best wishes to you 💜

My wife and her friend do a lot of puffy-yarn things like this, and she's asking me for a pattern. Can you get the pattern from you mom and post it?
Can she make me one
This just made me cry. My mom loves knitting, and I wish I could ask her to make me one. We lost her almost a year ago from cancer (f*ck cancer). Take a photo with your mom while wearing this, you won’t regret it.
Your mom’s a nice lady!
