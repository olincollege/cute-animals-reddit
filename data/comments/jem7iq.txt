He must be the one mentioned in legends
Maybe he's praying for cats and hasn't gotten enough yet.
What am I doing wrong in my life that I‚Äôm not surrounded by a bunch of playful kittens?
I bet 10$ he's the one that feeds them.
[deleted]
You can tell an awful lot about a place from the way stray animals behave around the people!
I was hoping he'd give in and start petting them
The Dalai Lama has a pet cat he's quite found of. My understanding is he always keeps one around.
This is a great depiction of how thoughts do their own thing when one sits in meditation.
At first I thought he had a phone in his hand
I'd be like "Enlightenment can wait, I need to pet these cats right now"
I am one with the Kitten. The Kitten are one with me.
I was waiting for him to start giggling. I know why he didn‚Äôt so fair play to him for having that level of focus
If one sits down in his lap, he‚Äôll be on his way to enlightenment because there‚Äôs no way you move from that spot with a sleeping cat in your lap.
That is impressive af!
Is there anything more peaceful than kittens playing on a Buddhist monk
wish i had the mental fortitude not to burst out laughing and play with kittens frolicking around me. i'd have achieved so much more in my life.
I believe the cats are reflecting his energies (or something like that). Showing that he is like these playful kittens but dedicated to his work
if he's a buddhist, he is probably meditating not praying
/r/PetTheDamnCat
Earlier that morning they Chief monk walked in and says ‚ÄúToday you will face your greatest challenge...‚Äù
At the end of Bangla Road (left side) in Phuket a bar had this plant/scratching pole type set-up.

There was at least a dozen small cats like the ones above who just attacked this pole for hours on end. Leaping on it, hanging off it, rough-housing each other, kung-fu flying in from all angles.

It was in the middle of the bar and nobody gave a stuff as these little cats carried on.

I miss Thailand.
This is one of his hardest tasks he must preform on the path to monkhood.
I feel like cats have a sacred duty to disturb everyone and everything
u/savethisvideo
The truest test of a monk‚Äôs patience and will. To resist the urge to pet.
Mara's newest manifestation.
I want kittens to play with me like that too
This is considered a good thing. Meaning this monk has such an aura that he attracts even animals. To a person who is religious, this may be seen as a sign of divinity. If you believe in that stuff.
It must have being his must entertained meditation
I have a 5 minute seated meditation I do every morning while waiting for my coffee to be ready.

Just the side of my kitchen I sit lotus and breathe. Been at it for a long time with this specific practice.

Every morning my huge lumbering dump truck of a cat just barrels into my leg expecting butt pats and whining like crazy.

I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs here to help my practice.
Well if he's praying for inner peace and happiness it's working.
This really cheered me up today! Thanks for posting.
I once read that you can judge a place by their stray cats. If the cats are friendly, bold, and relaxed, then you are in a good village with good people.
If inner peace means no kittens I don't care for inner peace
Christian god: I will test your faith with a disease. 

Buddhism: I will test your faith by having you ignore playful kitties.
I'd just pray for more cats to come, honestly.
This looks like the opposite of a problem to me...
When I was a kid I used to live in a city with a ton of feral cats, and my mom was friends with a local vet who would spay and neuter feral cats for free for us if we brought them in. So we'd catch feral cats and bring them to the vet, and then try and get them adopted (there weren't really many shelters). 

My method for catching kittens was basically this. I would sit near them very very still (I mean, I was a kid so I was playing Pokemon crystal on my gameboy usually, but I wasn't moving) until they came and played on or around me and the mom was getting less nervous about me. Then my mom would drop a box on the mom and I'd scoop the kittens up and drop them in with her. We got more than 50 kittens adopted that way.
I'm willing to bet he raised, or at least helped raise, those kittens...

I doubt they would be gravitating toward him otherwise
"Please keep the kittens playing here for ever and ever. Amen"
He‚Äôs already in heaven
Well, it seems he already reach Nirvana.
The human version of a cat tree
I can SEE his focus. It takes a lot to not to pet the cats. Kudos to this guy.
That's the last test for becoming a monk, the ultimate distraction! Some consider it too cruel, but finding enlightenment is a hard path to travel.
Even Budda wants you to pet each 1 once, like a little prayer bead and go back to hymns.
I thought all religions were clear on the ‚Äújust pet the damn kitties‚Äù rule.
I feel like this is the most Buddhist thing that ever happened.
"When you can recite the prayers among kittens, it will be time for you to leave." - Master Kan
Are these chants In Sanskrit? Sounds very much like it
'The power of cats compels thee!'

Life is suffering, but there are exceptions

Ah yes I forgot about the most difficult Buddhist test of discipline... The kitten test.
Ultimate test of meditation
This man is blessed.
And where are these childrens parents..? Tsk tsk

He has some TALENT. I always give my mom the excuse that Bruno( my dog ) disturbed me while I was studying XD
Thats will forged from steel. I would've have lost it during first second, and started messing with them. And Im allergic dammit.
As a Buddhist, I can confirm. Every time I go to temple, I see a few kittens playing around Buddhist monks. They don‚Äôt make a move a bit all morning. All they do is praying and lecturing. Lol
Kind of what it's like having a girlfriend.
Reminds me of my work as an electrician. Sometimes my customers do have some playful kitties and puppies .Depending what I am doing at the moment I just let the cuties use me as a play fortress while I do my work smiling over my face. üêàüêï
Why do you test me buddha?
no to be a stickler but monks dont pray, they meditate
I appreciate his resolve, but there is nothing more spiritually satisfying than playing with kittens...fight me
When your drowning in p*ssy but desire is suffering
You can make a meditation out of petting a cat, in my eyes he missed an opportunity.
That's it. I'm becoming a monk
Cats are indeed a test of faith
This is kind of proof that the best strategy to attract cats is to ignore them!
These kitties probably live better then most people with the monks feeding and providing a safe area for them.
Maybe this is a test? Possibly the q-test?
How do I obtain this stability
He has reached Purrvana
Isn't the point of mindfulness to live in the here and meow?
Seems more like missing the forest for the trees
I never wished so hard that someone would break. This certainly was anticlimactic.

On the other hand, he might really hate cats... like to the point of killing them on sight in his earlier life. If that's case, good job!
Am I the only one who thought he was looking at a phone really intently at a weird angle?
I can practically hear his thoughts. 

"DAMN these stupid cute kittens won't leave me alone! Can't they see I am trying to find happiness?"
Wish America had even a fraction of this discipline
Not only is that amazing determination and focus, know that those floors are tile. They're hard as hell. He is sitting on a very thin mat that provides almost no padding.
He is a man of focus, commitment and sheer fucking will
i can't wait to reach the stage of enlightenment where i can manifest kittens!
Dude is praying so hard he didn‚Äôt realize he reached Nirvana.
they might be his friends who died and are now disturbing him for fun
I have my experiences as a monk before (although I can be a monk temporarily for a set duration). 2 years ago, I became a monk at a monastery and guess what? It‚Äôs full of puppies! Monks are actually allowed to look after the puppies and feed them, even help the sick ones recover (of course with the monastery staff doing most of the stuff), during times of rest when we take breaks (maybe it‚Äôs just that I had an easier life because I was a temporary monk for 2 weeks). Some monasteries keep pets (most commonly cats and dogs) while there are some that don‚Äôt at all. So they are an added ‚Äúprivilege‚Äù (I don‚Äôt have a better word to describe) to the life of being a monk.
He is meditating not praying. He realizes the kitties are nothing but samsara, he takes mental note then focuses on the mantra
Peace radiates Peace
That looks so divineüòá
TIL I could never become a Buddhist monk.
Resistance to pet 100
He's surrounded by **higher power^4**
The final test of dedication
The universe was testing his attachment to cuteness
/r/petthedamnkitty
For far longer than I can admit, I kept thinking that the black thing behind his palm was a phone that he was holding and that he was staring at it.
What a metaphor for life.  Learning to keep focus has been one of the most important skills I‚Äôve learned.  This is a good example of that.
Talk about a test
My freshest yet. Thanks for the smiles you bring.

Dedication to meditation.

I wish I could dedicate that much concentration into one subject.
so for anyone interested there is Nga Phe Kyaung monastery on Inle Lake, Myanmar - better known as Jumping Cat Monastery

it's a nice part of a day trip on the lake and so many cats just chilling with the monks

Universe: Sorry, no. Have some kittens.
The cats be worshipping him tho
Cruelest thing on this sub. This must be NSFW...
Maybe he is praying for more cats.
What kind of a god says don't pat the kitty!? Kitties!?!
Do you think he is even aware of the cats, or is he to deep in meditation?
Yeah no shit. These guys don't flinch even when they're on fire.
Nerves of steal this one.
We fight on the bald one, when the clock strikes twelve.

So, if you are religious. Cats come to you

Well I found a good reason to join the church then
#major test of strength#
Haahha truly one with the right here and meow.

Mortal prays to be in touch with the universe, universe decides to touch back.
Oh my goshüê±üíï, he‚Äôs committed ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
"Well, I'm at a bit of a loose end. Shall we go and frolic in the gardens, or take a few fish out of the temple pond?"

"Nah, that guy looks like he's trying to get something done, let's go and fuck with him for a bit."
That is some serious self control
Tell me he pet all those kitty‚Äôs
I feel like whatever you're praying to, it can't get mad if you pause real quick to pet some kittens.

If it does you're in the wrong religion.
He has achieved kittzen
I'm actually pretty interested in the song/chant they're doing.  What's the translation?  Is the song pattern well-known and have a name?  I ask because there's some songs that go with praying in the Philippines that my parents have talked about that were meant to only be sang, not exactly with accompanying instruments, and were only heard at home, sung by the matriarch of the family leading prayers for certain feast days.
Dammit cats, please, I'm at 98%
Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of willpower?
Buddhist Meownk.

So this is what Heaven looks like
What divine torture
Anyone else think it looks like he was holding an iPhone?
I suppose those cats are Buddha's blessings to him...
No God is worth ignoring kittens.
One of the most adorable things I‚Äôve ever seen
Bloke must be super enlightened that cats started playing with him and let them just because he wants every creature to be happy.
He got chosen by so many cats tho. I'm lowkey jealous.
When you've mastered meditation
I'm pretty sure a Buddhist monk doesn't "pray" to anything, or anyone. Maybe "meditate"?
This is so adorable! Bless the Monks
They truly are masters of self-control
He found the secret of the mother with little children. I have practiced this technique plenty of times.
I would have broken way before then
There's this guy and then there's me giving in to scoop and roll in a ball of cuddles
The final test to become a Buddhist monk: Be able to meditate while cats play with his robe.
If this ain‚Äôt the final test for enlightenment then idk what is
I want to be a monk but damn I didnt know this obstacle existed
I think Buddha will understand if you pet those sweet babies for a moment.
My thing is, even if he stopped to play with the cats, he would have just been embracing the Zen of the moment. I would have laughed, but I'd make a pretty bad Buddhist.
Props to him for maintaining focus, though. That's some next-level AWWW.
Somebody rolled in the catnip before prayer.
The final test!
A TEST OF FAITH
I bet he‚Äôs praying for a dog.
...and that's how you grow a Sith.
that's not praying in western sense, and the best I could describe it is ritualistic chanting mediation
r/petthedamncat
Pet the damn cats you lucky bastard!
petting those kitties > meditating
Is that the dalai meyowma?
Wasn't the Buddha against a completely ascetic life though? He didn't want people to forego all of life's pleasures; just to maintain a balance. The answer is not to live in total opulent decadence nor complete asceticism, but in a balance. In that line of thought, it would be perfectly acceptable to play with the kittens that are playing around you, right?
I would definately started giggling
The mental fortitude on this man
Nothing is more interesting to a cat than someone not paying attention to them
I literally thought he was filming them on his phone hahah .
That video is so soothing the still monk the chanting and the kitties, stretch it out longer and it would be as good as any other relaxation tape.
Did anyone else think he was filming them with a phone?
He is a stronger man than I.
And the way the black cat strolls over like ‚Äúoh this is where we are wrestling today? ‚Äú
It's nothing to do with me,'' he said, ``I am not involved with people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man.''

``Ah!'' barked Zarniwoop, ``you say `The Lord'. You believe in something!''

``My cat,'' said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it, ``I call him The Lord. I am kind to him.''
>!kat!<**ZEN**
Fun fact, Buddhist do not pray in general (there are certain division of Buddhism that do). Buddhism do not have a God like other religions do (they have figure that they look up to, but they are not God, they don't determine the fate of others).

What they are doing is "singing the classics", which are texts that are written by great Buddhists, and presumably will help you "understand the world". 

The ultimate goal of a Buddhist is to "understand" (whatever that he/she is trying to understand), not to connect with a God, like most other religions in the west.
Roll for concentration!
My wife says he must be seeking purrvana
Cats are good.  Half in,  half out anyway.
That‚Äôs some goddamn discipline right there.
Man, I wish I was this focused on / dedicated to /motivated by literally anything in my life. As soon as i heard their little feet running towards me I'd have to ask for forgiveness and put whomever I'm praying to on hold because I'm gonna pet the kitties dammit
If they had kittens at church, I might start going again.
That chant is beautiful
My ADHD havin ass would instantly drop what I'm doing and cuddle the shit out of those little gremlins.
Why's he praying? He's clearly already in Heaven.
Really disappointed he didn‚Äôt stop to pet the kittens.
Perhaps he doesn't realize that he is sanctified by their sweetness.
Nirvana achieved
Must....resist....kittens....urg
Buddhist texts say that neither smoke nor wind should interfere with your meditation/prayer.

Apparently kittens are OK.
Sorry, not sorry, but this is a path not worth pursuing if you can't stop to play with kittens.  

Life is short.  Play with kittens dammit!
I feel so inadequate now. If my nose itches while I meditate, I will stop to scratch it.
As a bad monk, I would have given in, citing obvious signs the universe and gods require me to live in the earthly moment to play with the kitties.
I can‚Äôt respect a religion that believes praying intently supersedes kitten cuteness. To be fair... I don‚Äôt have a ton of respect for most religions.
What a miserable life
Omg, my cat loooves to interrupt my prayer time. It works out, tho, because, as an emissary of Satan, he needs all the prayer he can get. Lol
I can‚Äôt support any religion that would prevent me from playing with the kittens.
Such strong mental fortitude to resist cuddle.
Proof that cats can read energy. They all feel so safe around him üôÇ
I don‚Äôt have that kind of will.
resisting temptation
Prayer exam:

"Release the kittens."
Buddha would want you to play with the cats.
Meanwhile God is like,  dude how many cats do you need to feel better?
This has to be a test. The other monks put those there
Theres these cats at my mosque that waits for us until we‚Äôre finished praying just so we can play with them
Second incarnation of goat yoga.
This final test
Dude has obvious animal magnetism.
Well that's one way to master focus.
superior meditation skills
This is the final level. In order to achieve complete enlightenment, you must be able to ignore the playful kittens.

No one has ever reached this level.
Praying or meditiating, why is someone filming him?
He is doing it to tell the cats the 5 Noble Truths, so they, too, can achieve Nibbana. That is the sign of a Boddishitva.
Ok but maybe they're onto something. This looks about as close to inner peace as any human will evet achieve.
This.... this scares me of how much will power this man has to not pet the cats
Me trying to sleep while my 4 free-roam ferrets go crazy
I don't get it.  Can't he stop praying?  Haven't his prayers been answered?
That‚Äôs an iron will if I‚Äôve ever seen one. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it five seconds.
Plot twist: He was praying for more cats and his prayers have been answered.

Believe in Buddha!
He is praying for more cats.
That‚Äôs dedication because I totally would have aborted that plan and played with the cute kitties!
My initial assumption would have been that they test monks' resolve by subjecting them to physical or mental pain. Now I see there is a far harder test for them to pass.
Love how Christians use the word prayer to describe meditation. It's just so misguided.
This is a test of strength and will I could never pass.
I'd be a bad monk cuz there's no way i could resist breaking prayer for this lol
It is not his place to tell Kitty's that they should not play. It is not his place to tell Kitty's how they should play.  He respects nature, he respects their right to youthful playing.
Maybe he was praying for kittens.
He‚Äôs not praying he‚Äôs meditating.
Maybe. Moms of multiples do that too
This must be the final level
the secret: the kittens are there to make sure no one breaks prayers
only people who didnt break prayers get to pet them
Mad respect to him for keeping focus. I could never have that kind of restraint
The monk is the Buckingham Palace Guard.
The cats are the pesky tourists trying to make the guard laugh.
That meme, he is a man of sheer fucking will. Is this guy.
Maybe that's what he was praying for... kittens.  Lots of kittens =\^..\^=
I think he is praying for restraint! I'd fail big time and play with them.
He's probably allergic to cats too.

My cats seem to instantly know when a person enters our house and is allergic.... That's their target to sit on and rub against.
Pure will and determination /s

He's lucky he's profoundly religious, because ignoring those lads otherwise would seem awfully rude
When I was in Bangkok for a conference, there were stray cats EVERYWHERE. Especially in the temples, where they knew it was safe to be. I spent a good portion of my time there feeding cats using p√¢t√© I bought at the closest 7-11, and I don't regret a single second of it.
Lol cute

I like to think that they stock temples with kittens to make prayer more wholesome in the same way fishermen stock ponds with fish to make fishing more pleasant.

Or this is like an intensive prayer boot camp and their version of US Navy Seals' hell week where they drown cadets in freezing water to make them crack is to instead drown monks in kittens to see if they crack and stop meditating and pet the kittens. Like the prayers we hear in the back ground is the monk equivalent of "OKAY YOU MAGGOTS!!! DROP AND GIVE ME TWENTY!!!"
These monks live off gifts from the local village and tourists, this setup might get them some extra donations in the penny-jar.
I love this, exact same scene everywhere in South East Asia. my late Grandfather usually finish with his 5 daily prayer and just petting those kittens afterwards. 

I'm a Muslim so I usually play with cats outside of the mosque before we enter praying. 

That's why there was a viral video in Malaysia where a cat refuses to leave grave after the burial prayers. the deceased daughter realized that it was the same cat who he greeted everyday when he entered the mosque.
Who is the buddhist monk praying to?
In ancient Indian lore, the gods used to send apsaras (angels/fairies) to tempt the meditating monks. It was kind of a test and sometimes resulted in a big plot twist. This is the modern version lol

Sometimes you just have to stop and smell the kitties.
Reminds me of my mother calmly paying bills by phone while my two younger sisters and I ran back and forth through the kitchen screaming and fighting. (I'm 40 so back then you had to call the companies and speak to a person to pay a bill by credit card. Also, the phone was on the kitchen wall with a curly cord attached to the receiver.)

Ha this is lovely. About half the time I try to meditate my cats push open my bedroom door and start meeping at me or decide to sit on my lap. I consider it a challenge at this point, but a nice one that makes me smile.
That sure looks like Nirvana to me.
This reminds me of that monk meme with the chick and her tig ole' bitties!
Kittens don‚Äôt know from praying.
Kitties: what ya doin'.. what ya doin'.. man?

I don't think he is particularly one with everything if he's ignoring the kittens who want to play
this is hardcore Buddhism. becoming completely detached from all worldly possessions.. even love for pets..I wouldn't be able to do that, my dogs deserve to be loved
kittens I'd be cool with but once monkeys come around, there's no way I'm staying in a meditation.
Is this in Atlanta? I used to go to a temple with monks constantly on their iPads lol
He's a Disney Princess!
‚ÄúAs the cats keep playing, I must keep praying‚Äù
This has to be on a poster for inner peace.
Must....resist....the cuteness!
That's actually his final exam. If he passes without petting, he gets his degree and go off to a succussful monk job.
Is he praying in Cataran?
Its because of he's a Buddhist. Cats know Allah. They are trying to stop him with their cuteness, actually.
He has a stronger will then me ü§£ I would be too tempted to play with them.
It is like the kitten test or something.
He looks like Dangdo
Does anyone know why pets play like this literally on top of humans? When my two dogs get into a playful mood and we're on the couch, they tend to play on the couch, too. And it's like they intentionally push their backs into us and flip upside down onto our laps while still play-biting at each other.
The kittens gods have answered his prayers 4X
At first I thought he was holding a bowl of soup.
That's the biggest test of faith I've ever seen
I feel like any religion would let you stop praying and and enjoy yourself when you suddenly have a pile of kittens climbing and playing on you.  I mean isn't that whomever you are praying to just rewarding you for your piety?
Non Buddhist kittens: We will keep playing..
Monk: Pets the cats

God: I'll allow it.
The new Rage Against The Machine album cover isn‚Äôt as hardcore
He's a better man than I.
Cats will always be cats.. I love that.
The ultimate test
Wish I had that much self control
This is his final test!
Well his robes are the perfect playground! I can drape one blanket over a chair and suddenly it's the hottest place to be in the apartment.
What a boss
Kitthai atthaiks!! üêà
This one has achieved inner peace.
The willpower is strong with this one
I guess we know what the One True Faith is.
Urge to not stroke kitties.....Mustttt resssssist....
It sounds like he‚Äôs singing
r/PetTheDamnCat
This confirms for me that ignoring cats is guaranteed to get their attention.
Those cats: We......will......keep.....playing.....
You gotta wonder if Nirvana is worth it.
This cats are everywhere xD
I would stop praying and play with the kittens ASAP
I wonder if this is a psychological torture technique?  You know, like they would do if hiring you to be in the CIA or FBI.  Testing your ability to remain focused and not give into distractions.

I would fail the test each time.  Look, kittens! üòÇü§£
Honestly, that's precisely what I'd be praying for!
This is a perfect metaphor for the ADD battle in my brain. .
Me when I'm working out and my dog wants to play.
You know this guy is 100% a saint when the scene starts looking like something out of a classic Disney movie. :P
The monk in an hour:

"What cats?"
Trying to achieve the medallion of spiritual oneness
Why does he need to pray he is in heaven
He's probably thinking to himself:
If that isn't a person who has given up worldly pleasures, I don't know who is.
Inner peace...Inner peace...Inner peace...
So that‚Äôs how I find inner peace
Actually the prayer is a blessing prayer. Usually monks recite this when nearing a payer session end to give blessings to the people who have come.
Must conZentrate...
"Buddha! This isn't exactly what I was praying for!"
Cute and all but is it just me or dies this prayer slap HARD?
As much as they try to act otherwise, cats really aren't fans of being ignored. :)
u/SaveThisVIdeo
They should have put these kind of monks in sekiro instead of those damn centipede bastards
I am both very impressed and very disappointed that he didn't break
The ultimate challenge that god sends him
Must not disturb cats
r/PetTheDamnCat
Lol I don't know why but I did not read the title and it looked like he had a phone and was filming the kittens...
Lawd they spiritual
Next level shit right there.
He is the chosen one!
He must be the one passion on kittens in legend
i like his perseverance.
I see, he is praying to baast the Egyptian cat goddess today.
That's how they train.
Would it be a war if I said that the Reddi upvote button colour is the same as this Buddhist monk's dress?
Good thing he isn't squealing at the cuteness overload
Literally me and my 2 cats whenever I meditate
awwmmm...
 But when the cats needed him most, he vanished..
They‚Äôre the answer to whatever it is he‚Äôs praying for.
üòç
That guy is hardcore.
I bet he's allergic
He will attain moksha and break the cycle of rebirth
What a monster, I'd just laugh and then start playing with kitties
This is the age where kittens are truly little terrors. They stay like this for about two years.
r/watchpeopledieinside
Impossible.
Oh man, he is good! Not even a smile or a glance! Those kits were wrassling in his clothes! üòÜ
I taught.......I saw.......a puddy tat.
There's a Zen story where a monk is asked by a rich woman to living on her property to be helpful with wisdom, etc. 

She eventually burns his house down because he is too meditative and distanced from reality.
For way too long I thought he had a phone in his hands and was recording them ._.
Holy shit this guy is a professional
Now THAT is discipline
 Som anh som put som mouy riel
Cats say in Jim Carrey voice: "He's good. With my help, he could be the best"
Firestar and gray stripe are dukeing it out and raven paw is sitting on the mans lap
A master of Cat-Fu
Meditating? Chanting? Relaxing?

*Not on ~~my~~ our fucking watch*
The Noble Path, with kitties.
His self control tho
r/petthedamncat
He‚Äôs trying so hard not to break
I thought he was taking a video with a cell phone at first.
Where can I sign up for this class?
It was better than watching WWE wrestling.
I know that I couldn‚Äôt do this.
Damn thats some next level self control...I wouldn't be able to resist petting those kittens
I admire this dude's preserverance. I would have pet the cats in 2 seconds.
Monk: Kitten go away.

Ralph the Kitten: No.
Is this like some sort of cosmic test of his dedication? I would fail horribly.
[deleted]
/r/PetTheDamnCat
Wait,
Have we all been duped?
Are those folks who spend all day in prayer or meditation just on the best siesta schedule known to man?
This is the real test of faith
Don‚Äôt they have a code of silence? Why is there singing
Was just gonna keep scrolling but had to show this to you-

&#x200B;

u/KittyBikes47
Kittens: we.....will........keep...... Playing
Frankly, playing with kittens makes me feel more divine than most alternatives.
That is some serious focus.
Ended too soon, I wanna see if he started playing with them after the praying stopped
Lead me not into temptation. Lead me not into temptation. Lead me not into temptation...
True peace
monk - *praying*
kittens - ‚ÄúPLAY WITH US PLAY WITH US PRAY WITH US PLAY PRAY WITH US PLZ PRAY FOR US AND PLAY WITH USSSSS‚Äù
such a lucky monk, what would I not give to experience this
You think he prayed for cats? If so it worked and we need to learn this ability
This should count as cruel and unusual punishment
I really, really want to experience this .... exactly this ...
What strength „ÉΩ(ÔΩ°‚óïo‚óïÔΩ°)Ôæâ.
"You have conquered the frozen mountain.  Now comes your final test..."
I WANT THEM ALLLLL
This is the equivalent of the stories of Ghandi sleeping with naked girls to "test his restraint".
That‚Äôs some concentration!
What‚Äôs going on in his head: ‚ÄúI am going to pet the fucking shit out of these kittens when I‚Äôm done with this meditation‚Äù
Here. That is actually the cutest thing on the internet.
u/savethisvideo
I legit thought he was holding a phone at first. "Hey guys, its YoBuddhist here! Praying with my kitties! Follow and subscribe! #YoBuddhidt #KittenPrayers #WheresMyFood?"
Dudes mastered sage mode
Awww
u/vdownloader
This dude has more concentration and self control than i could ever possibly muster...
I've got cats and I meditate once a day. I know the struggle. This man really has a strong will.
Prayers answered.
He trying so hard not to smile
Cute :D
His self control is beyond human limits
Couldn't do it üòªüòªüòªüòª
Vipassana at a different level
Maybe this is how they learn patience.
To resist such adversity, he truly is on the path to enlightenment
\*the ultimate test\* 

Respect, man.
Ahhh the old kitty test!
God tests us in mysterious ways
Lmaoooo
[removed]
This has to be the most adorable and hilarious thing I've seen! lol
he has reached inner and outer peace
These guys meditating for enlightenment, not even realizing its right in front of them.

(I'm aware this probably isn't meditating as they're doing some sort of prayer, but the point doesn't land so hard if I point that out)
Definitely reminds me of my attempts at yoga in my living room while being distracted by my two poodles.
At first wasn't sure if he was really focused, or dead. But if he was dead they'd have been eating his face, so I'll go with focused !
His commitment is outstanding!
