"He's mine now"

‚ÄúThis dog is bonding with me already.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, no. Kenny‚Äôs a therapy dog. He apparently thinks you‚Äôre going through some kind of emotional crisis.‚Äù
That look.

"I don't think I'm getting any work done this afternoon boss"
Found a friend 
How do I get a job where people can bring their dogs to work?? 
Interns have now been officially hired as the pupper cuddler
For those of you wondering, our dog Coconut is a rescue from Korea who was unfortunately hit by a car. It has left her with a permanent head tilt and now she loves cuddling with people. My wife made her an instagram at @cocothejindo.

For anyone who is interested, please check out Free Korean Dogs (where we got her from), a rescue that is attempting to put a dent in the Korean Dog Meat trade. 
hi can i give you my resume
*sorts by controversial*
Trust your dog, their senses are better than most peoples

Hire her lol

Edit: changed ‚Äúthey‚Äôre‚Äù. Original thought was ‚Äútrust your dogs senses, they‚Äôre better than ours‚Äù, changed that and did not properly change it
Pupper is hers now. Have claimed. Sorry, OP. You‚Äôll have to marry her or find another fur ball for your own.
She now gets to add "Friend of dogs" to the skills section of her r√©sum√©
For any of those wondering, the dog in the pic is a Korean Jindo.

It's a very loyal dog and is very good at sniffing out cringey comments by thirsty neckbeards.  It's also smart enough to solve mechanical puzzles without pavlovian learning methods.

edit: for anyone interested in a Korean Jindo as a pet, please first consider the Jindo/Retriever mix breed.  They are all as playful and loyal without the mischief.  If you want something more docile, try a Jindo/Lab (though these are rare finds) or similar.  A purebred Korean Jindo is a great dog but super active and engaged.  They don't like being indoors all day and refuse to be separated from their owner for an extended period of time-- they won't get separation anxiety, they'll just straight up run away and try to find their owner.
It's against company policy to wake up a sleeping dog.

That look says "you can't have him back, fire me, I don't care"
Not your dog anymore 
There is an uncomfortable amount of cringe in the comments.
The way this is filmed and the face she makes this could be a clip from THE OFFICE
Y‚Äôall are thirsty af. 
what's with all these virgins tryna find the most outlandish way to call the girl cute
You might have to fight her to get your dog back.

Mods, this comment section is pretty garbage...
[removed]
Bunch of fucking creeps ITT
I mean, I figured the comments were gonna be about the intern but tbh, I just wanna cuddle that pupper. 
The thirst in the comments is real. 
Apparently it's creepy to find a girl attractive these days based on these comments
I've never seen anyone look more like an intern lol
creepy
This will get locked.
Bruh if your intern is actually a princess that has the ability to soothe animals, maybe you should hire them

Lost my dog.  No, I know where he is.  He left me for Crystal the intern...
Sorted by controversial. Got what I expected. 
You shouldn't be surprised, you brought in a lap dog.

The dog must have seen something quite upsetting on the phone. Maybe an image of a dog not being petted when asking for belly rubs.
[removed]
For no pay, that is the correct activity
I had a an internship where the boss would sometimes bring in her dogs. I would usually bribe one with treats boss didn‚Äôt know I had and then get back to furiously working hard aka typing up a storm in my cubicle with a dog basically in my arms like this. Dog would be passed out cuddling n I would be snuggling, but also working real hard. This usually ended with boss lady being like ‚ÄúI lost my dog‚Äù and then laughing when she found us this way.... if I could have worked like that everyday, I would probably be ok with a desk job.

Thats pure joy and happiness in a quick glance. Doggo cuddles can do that ‚ù§Ô∏è

There is nothing I love more than my dog pressing his forehead or cheek against me.  Melts me every time 
Well it looks like your dog cheated on you with another human.  I am sorry op.
OP are you Canadian? I think that's my neighbour.
I wonder how many of your office workers pretend to love having a dog come in for the day. In all these posts the one thing I wonder is how many people see the dog when they walk in and think ‚Äúoh god not again‚Äù

My boss left me with a broom, a bag of sand and a shovel on a concrete pad looking for oil stains.

I can‚Äôt blame her. 
Puppy love at it's finest

‚ÄúAll new employees must be approved by the dog.‚Äù
"He's mine now"

Dogs + Interns = Nothing getting done^2

I mean, that's just physics.
I think that doggo just might be in love.
It s no longer your dog
Can‚Äôt trust anyone.   
I think your dog has become a therapy dog...
That is the look of. This is now my property. Do not touch.. 
looks like somebody needed a hug
Heart warming cuteness.
Her dog now
My dream job
when you spell out W-A-L-K but don't take the dog out..
That look says 'damn, I'm caught sleeping at work'.
That looks like some good snuggles. 
My dog does this with guests. It's embarrassing. She's such a sap.
Funny how the zoom instantly stops when she opens her eyes
Best. Gig. Ever.
Dog

Is your dog available as a wing man? 
that smug look

she knows what she's doing
Awwwwwwwwüòçüòç
You have been replaced! 
How long were you gone?
Beware puppynapping interns...
Getting rescues from Korea is one of the most short sighted good intentioned things ive heard of in ages.
She's like, "fuck off. You don't pay me"!
You no longer have a dog. 
Your dog unfaithful 
I have that same harness for my pup. It's saved me from hours of being dragged. 
We treat dogs today like we used to treat children not long ago, roles have now reversed.
POSED
Is that an American Eskimo? Looks just like my boy! 
No. N.
I think we have the same dog...
I'm surprised the comments haven't been locked yet

The angle this was shot at makes the notebook look like the size of her torso. The phone and ID also look enormous. It's really screwing with me.

I dated a white girl once and regret the day that I met her. She liked to fight and talk to much. I called her Conor Mcgregor.
Hire her. 
They‚Äôre both so adorable 
That girl has a really nice face
Not sure if I'd rather be the intern or the dog. That is a cuddle of love.
I also need a wingman like this.

That intern just got a permanent job. And possibly a date later that week. Who knows?

Pay that girl.
Thats a hot intern you having there.

Bang
Can‚Äôt believe no one has noticed she looks like Pam from the office, but hotter
I'd give her a snuggle too
[removed]
