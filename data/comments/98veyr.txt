Super cute!
No,I choose to believe that he is part unicorn! 
He's a Lisa Frank animal! They do exist!
The coloring looks way too even - I think someone tried to rainbow chalk your dog.
Zero regrets show on that face

Yeah.. my dog rolled on top of a hedgehog corpse this saturday. It was 'buried' under a pile of leaves so i didn't see it in time (not to mention it was quite squished). Would've loved to trade that for some chalk.
Rainbow Brights puppy... you should give him back to her
Pet the Rainbow. Taste the Rainbow.

You can do this to any white dog with different flavorings of kool-aide packets 
White cute dog evolves tooooooo...
RAINBOW SUPERCUTE DOG CHALK MODE!
Gotta admit though... it made an already pretty dog into a piece of artwork.
When I was a kid, we would rub sidewalk chalk down until it had a decent coat and roll our fluffy white kittens in it. Not only was it cute, it gave us an excuse to give them a bath right afterwards to acclimate them to water. 
just ready for the bar-k color run?
He was trying to teach y'all how to blend, step up that sidewalk chalk game.
My grandkids have also dyed their dog multicolors in red white and blue. I think its fantastic.
Chalk the sidewalk in different patterns every week and make cards. I’d buy that.
Rainbow pup!
Ariana Grande is shooketh 
He’s become the best kind of art.
Probably just ate too many Skittles.
Your dog is a gay icon now. We own him. 
He looks quite proud of himself too.
Roll the rainbow
Don't let the dog lick it it's not good for them to lick chalk
He looks like a gay snowcone
He's beautiful. 
Keep him like that.
Now he’s art!
Real life sparkle dog
B-E-A-U-TIFUL

Your socket is upside down. 
My heart is melting this is too cute!
Okay, who stained my pillow?
He ate a 🌈 rainbow when you were not looking!!
That dogs got the stiffy uh.  
Don't wash him ever ( ＾∀＾)
Isn’t there a country where there’s a celebration where the people paint and decorate their dogs as a part of their worship tradition?

Edit: I just looked it up and I think what I saw was people involving their dogs in the Indian tradition of HOLI, which now that I’m looking into it is probably not great for the dogs health
Puke the rainbow
That the look of a man that regrets nothing.

With these things, it always turns out the person did it on purpose to their dog for Instagram or something.  
I notice the colors aren't all mixed together. They're in a rainbow pattern across the side of the dog's body.
No he didn’t, YOU rolled around in sidewalk chalk.

It is very cute, but also it sucks when you have to give your dog a bath/shower
