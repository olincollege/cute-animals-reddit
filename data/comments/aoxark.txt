The best part is when he snaps his head up but never opens his eyes.

He's saying "I love you, human, but stop...I was dreaming of mousing!"
Mom let me sleep for 5 more minutes. 
" Turn off the light pawlease"
awh the little lion!
That is such a pink nose


Omg
Where did you get my cat?! 
I wonder why cats do this.  Just to look cute, or to feel more cozy? 
WAKANDA FOREVER
My orange tabby does this exact thing :)
I do that too. Probably not as cute though. 
Wakanda forever. Dreams of being a black panther
Looks a lot like my cat. Maybe cat brothers? 
https://i.imgur.com/qWXVtC3.jpg
I think I have that exact couch - from IKEA?
Mine does this too 😭😭😌
Some cats have to [get creative to turn off the lights.](https://i.imgur.com/Oqe5o7t.jpg)
JOJO POSE
Omg I squealed out loud I LOVE it when cats do this 😻💙💗
For the curious. What we're looking at here is an anterior horn motor response to an interrupted REM cycle specifically with an upper dorsal myoclonus component. Very common in cats. 
You're Damn Lucky he ONLY does THAT part of the Secret Incantation. 
Awwwwww
What a sweet baby
That much cute has gotta be illegal, right? 
Wakanda foreva! 
Aww. That cute pinkie toe beans! 😍
I don’t know him, but I love him. 
Ughhhh my heart 
A bit of a /r/cuddleroll!
I can’t stand not intervening with kisses when this happens!!! Ohhhh Goodness!!!
My ginger guy does the same exact thing! If your buddy had freckles on his lil pink nose, I'd think they were the same cat. 😅
Both of mine do this and I love them!
My little tuxedo does this too. It makes my heart flutter.
I just love orange tabby males! They’re so gentle and sweet. 

Your fella is such a sweetheart 💕🐱 

Reminds me of my cat that I just had to put down today. What a beautiful animal. 
This must be an orange tabby thing! My little dude does this too and it makes my heart so happy every time
I call that The World is Just Too Much pose when my cat does this. Like he just can’t even. 
This looks a lot like my cat Braveheart who sadly passed away this past summer at the age of 19 I miss him dearly to this day he was my best friend and this made me smile. Thanks op. 
My cat does this tooooo!!! It's my fav 😍
Those cute pink toe beans melt me
*"Wakanda Forevahh"*
My cat used to this exact move every time he slept , he was such a sweet boy ! We put him down about 5 months ago now and I can’t believe how much this brought me back to having him right next to me.
My orange tabby does the same thing except he will only do it if hes laying in his bed and he wants attention. If you walk by him he will do this but leave one eye uncovered and give you the cutest "look how lonely I am" side eye while he pretends not to look at you 
*i'm not even using 100% of my cuteness.*
"I am teh Dracula -- do not effe with me hooman."
Mine do this too! It’s the sweetest 
When he crossed his paws over his face, I swear, just for a moment, I could hear the pillar men theme song
He has some fine looking feet too.
Omg that made my heart HURT it’s so cute!!!
Don’t like cats but that’s adorbs.
For those about to die we salute you.
oh god that's so cute 
Ours does the same thing. So adorable. 
Quality post!
🥰 aww to frickin cute 😍
That cat is from Wakanda.
Wakanda Forever
I bet he was saying "WAKANDA FOREVER" in his dream.
Heart melt...
OH MY GOD
Aww haha I could watch this all day. Definitely made my night! 
wife's puppy does that too smh
I just died of cuteness overload!
 Thought this was my cat when I was scrolling! He looks identical and does the same thing
That is so precious 😍
Oh god, one person post wakanda comments, now everyone is doing it forever. 
Too cute looks like a little tiger 😍
I just want to pet the kitty
Wakanda forever!!!
This is crazy cute. We had to put our old kitten (22 y/o) down 2 years ago and it’s still hard to deal with. This is the type of video you can watch forever and will always remember the good times. I’m very happy that you have a great relationship with your kitty and hope the best going forward!
Wakanda forever.
Wakanda forever
I don't like cats, but I don't hate them.

This makes me want a cat. 
My cats do the same and I wake them up with kisses. Normally they give me the look, but lately they expect the kisses. Melts my heart. 
My cat does this when I turn the light on, then he gives me evil eyes for a few minutes. I love that bastard
Aww he’s such a cutie. I love his pink little nose. He looks just like my parents orange tabby. They’re so handsome.

As soon as I saw it "oh my god how cute" came out of my mouth.
Wakanda Forever
Wow I literally just died of cat cuteness overdose 
wakanda forever
#WAKANDA FOREVAH
My cat does the same, it's so cute
So cute 😻
u/wolverine-claws hope this makes your day slightly better 
"OHHH FUCK YOUUUU, TURN OFF THE LIGHTS, PLEASE!" 
My heart!  He’s so cute. 
why can I smell this video? a warm, fuzzy furball right by your face purring its a good life
I spent 16 years trying to get a video of my cat doing this in her sleep and never got it
Oh geez that's cute 😭
Looks like my Cliff. He does that, too. It's the best.
My cat does that too and I’m so glad you got yours on video because I never can! So cute!!
Pure adorable
Awe what a sweet orange tabby...doing the backwards stretch while sleeping 💜♥️💛😍
Mine does this too :)
It’s so cute when my cat does that
I'm not sure why, but that reminds me of puss and boots from shrek
Aw my kitty does this too.
Sooooo cuuuuuute x.x
oh god my heart
He is powering up 
Oh man what a beautiful orange baby😻😻
Pretty bad ass, looks like an anime character powering up 
My gf’s signature move is to elbow me in the fucking face. Not as cute
Omg my cat does the same thing, too! Sometimes when I pet her, she press my hand to her face with her paws like this and I just melt! 
My cat does this too it's so cute
I am worthy of my own love 💕
My cat does that and it makes me wanna cry it’s so cute
We used to have a cat that would do something like that and I always said he was hugging himself.
She's just changing the current channel to a better dream.
Awesome... skipped this several times as I scrolled, but AWWWWW...Definitely the right subreddit!!!  
Damn that is one cute cat self hug. 
God I miss my Winnie
Oh my. That is cute. 
These are the types of videos that make me want to get a pet.
We call this "squeeze face".  All three of our cats, including Orange Cat, do this.  I love it!
OMG...too cute. 
My ginger does this too! It's so fucking precious. 
I wanna boop his nose
THANKS I LOVE HIM
This is the most adorable thing ever. 
Please hug your Orange Cat. Please. You cant do it enough.
[Your cat looks like my baby.](http://imgur.com/a/pgASU71)
Wow he’s awesome !
Okay we have a cat that does the exact same thing and looks exactly alike your cat. Are they clones or something?
My Cheeto looked exactly like that and did the same thing! He passed away a few days ago, and this made me smile. Sweet kitty! 
Cute and cuddly 
X-Force!
Awh cute kitty cat
Adorable 
Instant love. 
He's blocking a kamehameha in his dreams 
Orange cats truly are the best 
I love it when cats do the thing 
My cat does the same!
Oh my goodness he's so cute! And looks so much like [my Jabba](https://i.imgur.com/VhANmNb.jpg)!
I will pay anything for this cat. NAME THE PRICE.
OMG! 😍
So cute
My cat does this too, usually when we wake him up, sometimes I purposefully wake him just to see it
OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD /Quagmire

&#x200B;

(My cat does that too sometimes and I just want to squish the shit out of him after!! <3)
hidey-pidey eyes
Oh my god, I’m dead. Also, we have the same couch 
It's very effective
My Winter does this and it melts my heart too. 
Wakanda forever.... while I sleep 
That's a X-man
Why do you have my cat
Must be watching an Excision show.
Hmmmmm xenos making the sign of the aquila  pretty sure thats heretical
X gonna give it to ya.
Can someone put in the JoJo music on top of this
You need more loving humans in your life’s 
That Ikea couch is honestly the best thing ever. I had it too.
I’m in love
r/mademecry
Wakanda for ever
Wakanda Forever. 
Thats cute I would do the same when someone wake me up
/r/jellybeantoes
I had to stop what I was doing and make an account just so I could comment that my cat is the same size and looks literally exactly like that
Awwwww. He looks like a baby waking up from a refreshing nap. I swear if my baby sister was a cat, this is what she would look like.
Aww my sweet kitty Luna does this too its so cute
OH. MY. GOD. 
When you say “signature move” all I can think of is “ON THE CANVAS!”

Super adorable though <3
So precious and sweet! 💗
Wakanda forever
You couldn't be content with just your heart melting,  you had to go and melt mine too. Thanks 🙃
Wakanda furever! 
Plis protec this kitter
Well goodness me, that is just adorable 
Wakanda Forever
That is so very precious. 
He's from wakanda
Adorable cat :) How old is he?
I just died. DIED.
my big orange does this too <3
Wakanda furr- ever 
OMG seriously, why do they cover their faces with their tiny cute paws?!! I die when my baby does this.
Wakanda forever! 
Crazy adorable!!!!
My ginger kitty does the same thing!! 
Orange cats. You can’t beat these motherfuckers. They’re tigers and they know it. 

They will outlive all of us.








Fuck man. I’m tired of playing around with these stray cats in my neighborhood. I want a cat so bad :(
D’AAAAAW!!!
I love when my fur baby does that 😊❤️
Wakanda forever!
Awwww 😍
Hoo Haaa! Meowkanda forever!
My cat does this all the time lol 
I recently lost my ginger kitty who looked a lot like this  except he was polydactyl. He used to do this too and it's nice to see it again, even if it's not really him. 
Wakanda Forever 🙅🏾‍♀️
This makes me want to get a cat

Good boy
Aw baby boy!
I love when my cats do this! 
You need some smart light bulbs. "OK Google, dim the lights".
I squeaked 
My cat sometimes does that but he's usually blocking out the sun from his eyes when he sleeps.
Orange Tabbys are a gift from the Gods!
I literally made a squak-squeak noise omggg
Awww
Face SQUEEZE
🙅
Is this an orange cat thing because my cat does the same.
My kitties do this too!! I love it so much.
MAKE HIM A LITTLE SLEEP MASK THINGY PLS SO HE DOESNT HAVE TO BLOCK HIS LIL EYES WITH HIS HANDS
My cat looks the exact same and does the same thing!! He melts my heart
Those pink toe beans and nose look so boopable! 
I’m not crying, you’re crying! 

My ex-bf and I split up our cat children when we broke up. I miss that little monster! He looks just like your furbaby.
Wakanda forever!!
orange cats are the best cats
Nice cat
Wakanda forever.
My cat does this too. Is there a reason for this? Or are they just like us and saying “5 more minutes!”
Wakanda Forever!!
He looks so comfy!
He looks EXACTLY like my cat that ran away this past summer. Same size and everything. Super cute
Lol my cat does this too!

[His name is Gizmo!](https://i.imgur.com/4oPXhlw.jpg)
le cuteness.
Pro tip, if you put your arm between his arms before he pulls them in, you'll get a ton of affection and licks. My fuzz monkey does that. 
WAKANDA FOREVER
Fucking tabby’s man.. my girlfriends family has one that’s super cool. Hard not to love him
My cat does this too :')
I actually groaned/gasped at what that did to me
So cute
Those paws are pretty large
D’aw sleepy fren 
I have a ginger named Ringo, he does exactly this. Looks so similar I thought it was my girlfriend posting when I first saw it haha.  
wakanda forever
Wakanda foreva
Ah! I get those black panther dreams too
Adorable.
So this is where my cat runs off to everyday after I leave to work 
That sort of move should come with a cuteness warning.  
Awww!! I wonder if this is a ginger kitty special move? My orange boy Jack does this whenever I disturb him when he's sleeping. I too melt at it every time😹
My heart just grew several sizes larger 
My cat is like an exact copy of yours, every single thing your wee one does is the same as mine. And they look identical  😻😻
“Bastet is not ready to be awakened, mortal. Try again with offerings of tuna.”

Wakanda forever!
Awww your cat is so precious ❤❤
Wu Tang!
Adorable ❤️
I have the same couch from IKEA!
Catkanda forever!
😻 One of my favorite kitty things to see!! Adorable 
My little orange guy does the same thing!! Sooooo cute!! <3 
Self hug!
He's a smooth criminal.
That's so adorable! I love it. 
I made an audible “awww!” when I saw this ❤️❤️
that was so sweet, my teeth fell out!
My heart is melting too! 💕🐈
Very cute 
My orange baby does this too!! I thought this was him for a second
Wakanda foreva
Wakanda forever!
My grey boy kitty cat does this too. I die every time he reaches up to his eyes and nuzzles his nose into his paw pads.
Nice

Mmmmmhh, close the blinds. Cmon, lights out.
This is adorable
Wakanda forever!
It melted mine! 
He looks exactly like my Oscar a few years ago before his fur got so long
I miss my ginger kitty:( he did something very similar to this
Aww cat bliss.
Damn I want a cat :p
Awww my kitty used to do something similar. I loved watching her sleep. 
My spirit animal right there. 
Melttttt
Wakanda Forever ! 
Wakanda forever. 
Ours cat’s isn’t so cute: https://imgur.com/gallery/h9khfme
My kitty is black, not orange, and does this too.  Just to dispel the orange tabby theory.

My favorite is to tuck my hand in there which wakes him up and he squeezes my hand against his face and chest.
U can't see me nowww
Awww my cat does that too!!
Omg a carbon copy of my cat ❤️❤️❤️ adorable every time
Lovvvve
My cat does this too! Only when he's sleeping and I pet his belly. He grabs my hand and then stretches
He looks like he's powering up his Ultimate Move! How adorable. :^ )

^ me when I play video games and also when I watched this video.
I would die and also murder for him 
Thank you for this. I still unfortunately struggle with losing my cat Spaz almost 2 years ago. Yours looks exactly like him and did the same motion when you'd wake him up. Brought back good but sad memories. 
My orange boy does exactly this too. So sweet.
Wakanda Foreva!
I love him.
Oh my goodness! So adorable!
I had a boy who would do something like this, too. So damned cute. 
Awwwww
whoaaaa just found my cats twin
Instantly melts me anytime one of my pets does this 😍
Hands down the cutest thing my cat does.

He only does it with one paw, so this like doubly melted my heart 😍😍
Wakanda forever
Wakanda Forever!
My cat does the same thing! Ginger kitties!

WAKANDA FOREVER,now back to dreaming about dat damn mouse

I wanna hug this kitty so much!
[deleted]
Awww what a sweet orange little boy 😸😸 He reminds me of my big boy when he was a little one 
wish my cat did this
Omg stop it 
Five more minutes moooooom
My cat LOVES to cover his eyes with his paw when he sleeps.  I thought it was because once he saw me covering my eyes with my arm while I was sleeping but now I'm thinking it's a cat thing.  Seen plenty of pics on Reddit of cats covering their eyes with their paw while sleeping.
Awww
Orange tabbys are the best 
My orange kitty does this to! I love it so much 😻😻 melts my heart. 
Wakanda forev...ah forget it
[I wanted to add my son to the collection of sleeping Orange kitties](https://imgur.com/gallery/NhiCrbv) 
Wakanda forEVA!!!! Scan your 🐈 check the bottom lip.
Wukanda foreva
my orange tabby did the same thing!

we got him a little cat-cave to curl up in so the light would stay out of his eyes.
AAAWWWEEEEE
He's an X-Man
AH! My cat does that too and it’s the cutest thing!
Orange tabbies are the best 
Omg how do you resist squeezing that cuteness every time this happens? 
Wakanda forever
Cat is a paid actor
I call that the “smooshie face” move! 😻
If that’s not “aww” I don’t know what is! So precious. 
My cat does that too, but without his arms crossed! It's so cute!
Get the poor baby an eye mask 😭
I think I'm sitting on that exact same couch. Ikea Frieheten right?
😭
I love it when they do that.
My cat does this too! Super cute.
Cat - Wakanda forever!
Wakanda forever
I literally just let out an audible “aw!”
The bottoms of his paws are so orange! ❤️
I felt that stretch. I felt it in my soul.
Babiiieeee!

WAKANDA FOREVER! *ZZZzzz* *meow* *ZZZzzz*
That was the first thing I ever saw Tim, our elderly ginger tabby, do. He still does it sometimes. I call it "making his Xs".
That’s a F A T  D A B 
Wakanda forever
Awww my white cat used to do this!!
This made my day thanks
DAMN YOU!!! I hate cats but this is cute as fuck.
My boy does the same thing 💕
Wakanda forever 
Oh my too freaking cute
r/smooshyface
awww
Ommggggoooodnesss. My cat does the same thing. Sometimes I just stare at him until he does this 👀
Lol my bf showed me this apparently this is how I sleep when he  gets up in the morning aha 
This is going to date me big time but whoever remembers gaming on a Commodore 64, there was a game called Blue Max that I loved as a kid. My faithful buddy, Furful-- a big fat lazy Garfield lookin' fatty-- would chill next to me while I played. One day every time I got shot down in the game (which had a pretty specific sound) id sort of grab his head (not harshly at all, just like oh dang I lost and you're my pet kinda thang) and then one day after playing for a while, my plane went down and I looked at Furf and he looked at me and this little darling wrapped his paws around his head like this gif as if he knew what was coming. I fucking loved that cat so much.
OMG!
Wakanda forever
Tabbies are the absolute best 
Every now and then my cat O'Malley would do this, and I'd move to stand in the way of whatever light was shining on his eyes.

And in a few rare moments, he'd look me in the eyes, give me a long blink, then curl up in a more comfortable position and go back to his nap.
So cute! Can I have a copy of the video? Is it allowed? 
Wakanda Forever
[my majestic orange boy](https://imgur.com/gallery/gvc1egf) 
You win.
My kitty does this too. Extremely reliably actually, like any time I wake him up gently. I just got him to do it with a lil kitty kiss. First there's his little trill of surprise, then the flex. 

he's a lil tired kitty

Love cats. lol
this is soo fckin adorable 😍
Looks exactly like my cat 😭
It is so cute.
Wakanda forever
my little guy does the same thing.  It gets me every time. 
I swear my cat is your cats twin! They look identical! 
What's it purrrr, is it that time already?
Man’s best overlords.
Wakanda forever
My puppy lays on her back fully stretched out when she sleeps
Sleeping time :)
I physically “OOOOHH”ed 
can you hug animals and go to sleep and will they go to sleep as well or do they stay awake because it's so uncomfortable for them ?
My cat does this, too!!!
Stunning 
Omg this cat is so adorable!  😻
Dreaming he was the black panther 
Omg my cat does the same thing lol
The cat does 'Vakanda Forever'
My ginger George does the same too. He sometimes grabs my hand and does that move while pressing my palm into his snoot and falls asleep clutching my hand to his face. 


Wakanda?! She's doing the wonder woman boosh, obviously!
Those jeally beans in his paws.  It's like he has never stepped on anything dirty 
Wakanda forever!

My little girl Kringle does that too.  She also will just kind of stir in a deep sleep and wake her self up doing that little chirp that cats do:)
I love cats so much.
it is the cutest thing, and somehow makes a sleeping cat look soooo otherworldly comfortable. just little paw movements but it’s sooo everything :-) 
Such a Cute cat

WAKANDA FOREVA
Wakanda forever.
Someone has been watching vintage Wonder Woman lol
This just makes me happy.

I adore seeing cats that are obviously comfortable and feel safe. It may sound silly but cats tend to be very vigilant of their surroundings and are jumpy because of an instinct to stay vigilant. To see a cat display any vulnerability is very heartening to me, it suggests that it is in a safe environment and that it's well taken care of and hopefully very loved. 

It makes me very happy to see relaxed, content cats. 
Sweet cuddle boi
Wakanda Foreva! 
i just went AWWWW out loud...
toe beans tho
MY CAT DOES THE SAME THING TY FOR SHARING
My cat does the same thing I like to stick my hand between her paws and pretend she’s giving me a hug..

Cat: "WAKANDA FOREVER!!!"
Love the pink nose
It's welcoming us to Wakanda 
I'm looking for the "WAKANDA FOREVER" comments.
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen 
Anyone have any idea what animals dream about?
Wakanda forever 
Wakanda Forever!
Wakanda forever in my sleep

WAKANDA FOREVER
I wish I had a cat that could do this too, but I'm allergic :(.
I wonder if cats ever prick themselves with their claws by accident 
This is the feline equivalent of remembering that thing you said at a party that you wish you hadn’t said. 
I need a cat so right fucking now omg
Your cat is clearly cultured [https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/0f/15/270f15c349dd288806d65442744284a1.jpg](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/0f/15/270f15c349dd288806d65442744284a1.jpg)

Okay that definitely got a involuntary response from me that would have gotten my balls busted if I was with my friends. Would have been worth it.

He's gonna weapon X you.
My daughter found a little kitty on the side of the street and brought it home. Not really sure how to take care of cats. Always been a dog lover. Any tips from cat lovers? 
Mine did too.
More like his signature move when he is being bothered while trying to sleep with the lights on
Is that couch from World Market?

"Signature move"

Ah yes, the move that my cat does, my cat growing up did, most of my friends cats did as well. Quite a signature move.
i think hes telling u he need a dark place to sleep in

and not a show for u to enjoy over and over
Is your cat a jigglypuff?
That’s not “his signature move”. Your hand is sleep depriving him and it’s the “pulling the covers up on your bed” when the alarm goes off.  

The human is a pest.  

I hope he runs fast and loud every night to get back at you
Sounds like you got a problem with your heart. Nice cat though
That poor cat...
All cats do this. It's not unique or special.
No one loves a ginger except themselves
I hate cats
Reddit needs to stop making me watch this shit
