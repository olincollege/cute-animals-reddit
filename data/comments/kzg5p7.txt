Someone is always watching üëÄ
That‚Äôs a proper summer night vibe right there
I want what they have.
Are you sure this isn't Michael and Holly? Haha
You know there's a kid out there somewhere that this majestic couple embarrasses on the regular.
My favorite part is when she brings her head down and then back in a fit of laughter. That‚Äôs how you know it‚Äôs genuine.
They just watched an episode of the Iron Fist or Cobra Kai lol
Ha, did this once pretending to drunken boxing in chinatown and unknowingly dropped my phone. Someone picked it up then called my then girlfriend and we looked at each other confused and taking a bit to realize that I dropped it. 

The dudes who picked it up said they saw us playing around and thought it was hilarious. We were super relieved, super thankful, and super embarrassed at the same time.
Weird last time this was posted they were "Brother and Sister".
These are the small moments that make a relationship last a long time. So wholesome
My wife and I do weird stuff like this all the time.

It‚Äôs the best.

Edit: Example; my wife or I will randomly call out ‚ÄúÏã∏Ïö∞Ïûê!‚Äù (Let‚Äôs fight) or ‚ÄúÍ≥µÍ≤©!‚Äù (Attack!) and start a tickle fight. Or we will start randomly using terrible pickup lines on each other. Sometimes we will get into finger gun battles and use the surrounding or other people as cover. 

Fun times.
That‚Äôs their mating dance.
That's a nice European carry-all.
This is the kind of love I'm looking for
Cop: "I tried to get a statement, but they spoke only Chinese. And when the words came out, they didn't match their lip movements."
made me think of Michael and Holly
If my relationship is not like this then I don't want it
need this kind of relationship. love a goofy woman.
The walking away laughing together, the best kind of love!
Couple knowing where the street cam is.
Looks like they busted out some OA moves.
This is so fucking cute. I love them and their love.
Well framed for a coincidental filming -- they only begin when fully in camera view and as close to the camera as they can be when fully seen.
This is proof that there is a moron out there for every moron.
I‚Äôve seen this video throughout the years and my thought is always that this couple is probably so proud to be a symbol of a healthy fun relationship, even for a moment, and damn what a good feeling to have.
My ex and i used to get weird together
Now I‚Äôm with this new chick and when I do weird stuff she makes me feel weird cus she doesn‚Äôt do it
And I don‚Äôt like it

So this is what a healthy relationship looks like?
So tired of this fake clip being posted
This is definitely a relationship goal üòç
I had a girl like this ... I let her go.
If this is news to you, you've never been in love
Dude has a purse. He was already weird.
This is my relationship goals right here in this video
That's true love right there folks
This is the stuff that makes life feel like magic.
I see Michael and Holly doing this.
Back when we used to go to grocery stores together, if I was ever looking for my wife, I'd do the "secret signal" which was just a really bad crow impression. I didn't care who was around. Sometimes I had to do it in a few aisles before I'd either hear her laughing or find her trying to run away from me so I'd have to keep doing it
This just reminds me that there really is someone for everyone. It also just makes me think of how much I love my husband and how lucky I am to be able to be a weirdo with someone who is also my kind of weird, for a very long time.
If I could have any wife, I would want one like that
If my next relationship isn‚Äôt like this then I don‚Äôt want it
I want to marry someone who does dorky stuff like this
It's cute and all, but it looks staged.
Fake vibes
My SO and I keep thing fun like this and alway have a great sense of humor with each other.
Awwww ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Now that's a cute couple
Her laugh at the end. Love what this couple has.
Michael and Holly vibes.

Edit: Holly and not Molly.
Middle-aged foreplay.
so dorky. love it.
He playing Ryu in the street with his wife, he doesn‚Äôt care what you call his donut purse.
My bedroom window looks down on to the kitchen of the house opposite me. A young (I reckon mid 20's) couple live there and today I just happened to look out and saw them tea towel fighting with eachother. It really fucking made me smile
But we‚Äôre watching..... and who‚Äôs watching us?(turns to look at the camera).
And that's how you stay together
I've never seen anything or Reddit where I've truly thought "relationship goals" till I saw this. I hope they're together forever haha
I love the way she laughs afterwards.
When they **think** no one‚Äôs watching.
They look like they are having so much fun!
I need this in my life.
I love these people.  They get each other.  No doubt about that :)
Gonna go home and make a Karate Kid

Aaaaand I can't even get a girl to go on a date smh I must be ugly lol
As my father told me: "When you get married, the only way your marraige will survive is if you remain boyfriend and girlfriend."
great feeling..
i see my wife and her boyfriend do this kinda stuff all the time!
I don‚Äôt even want a man if he isn‚Äôt this spontaneous ‚ù§Ô∏è

Little do they know, 50000 + people are watching lol
The couple that plays together, stays together
They are the cutest!
They‚Äôll grow old together and live better than 99% of us, simply cause they enjoy each other‚Äôs buffoonery. Good for them.
It's true what they say, find someone that compliments your weirdness
Thanks, I love it.

Man, I wish I had something just like this.
Hubby and I do stupid crap like this when nobody else is around from time to time.  Our current thing is to blow raspberries in the air.  We call it "Farting around".

This is a very big sign of a healthy relationship, once you feel comfortable enough to get over your barriers and ac' a fool with your partner and it's no longer about impressing them but rather about acting like a dumbass for some laughs then you know you've found a real candidate for "the one."
 You mean:

### Couple getting AWESOME when no one was watching
I can tell they‚Äôre going to be married one day, if they already aren‚Äôt. After all....

*Stand users are attracted to other stand users..*
That's the best thing I've seen all day.
Ever see True Romance?  Quentin Tarantino's first?

Now this. This does put a smile on my face.
My husband and I do stuff like that all of the time! Nothing is better than finding your compatible weirdo!

Is this an agni kai or something? Xd
I feel so sweet
Listening to Sanctuary by Joji, thinking about my s/o, and scrolled by this...it's really cute together.
Looks like something that would be in The Office
Life Tip : find your weirdo. 90% of our breathless laughter comes from stupid shit we do just like this. 25 years.
I‚Äôve seen this vid posted multiple times on Reddit but goddamn if it doesn‚Äôt give me the biggest smile on my face every single time. That be some Michael-Holly-type love
I bet their names are Michael and Holly
It‚Äôs weird how they did it as soon as they reached that strange white spot painted on the floor.
The couple that watches Cobra Kai together stays together
Happy cake day

Aw I love this, especially the nearly falling over laughter that ensued after. I love sharing that kind of funny with people
Wholesome
I love that they are having fun and they clearly have something special but I‚Äôm also compelled to point out this wasn‚Äôt like, a spontaneous moment luckily captured on film. They obviously knew where the cameras frame is. They planned what they were going to do. You don‚Äôt walk in the middle of the road like that. You can also tell she was kind of waiting for him to start, because no one walks with that much hesitation unless she‚Äôs waiting for something to happen that she‚Äôs expecting.  Ok that‚Äôs all

Definitely keep it weird with your partner. No matter the length of the relationship. Day to day life can get monotonous and boring and stressful. Having someone who can just crack you up or play along with your weirdness is how you keep the love going and the sparks alive. Glad I have a goofball of my own. Our motto since we got married has always been, ‚Äúlaugh or you‚Äôll cry.‚Äù Even when shit sucks, find a way to laugh.
Who doesn't enjoy inside jokes?
Looks like the Aang/Katara dance from ATLA episode 'The Headband'
I really enjoyed this! Go them
It's sickening when u had a relationship like this & now yall dont talk at all

Real love something that will never get
They watched to much Cobra Kai lol
Some of the best moments I have laughing myself silly are when my husband and I get crazy for no reason.  Sometimes its dancing in the kitchen.  Sometimes its dancing with our dogs in the kitchen.  Sometimes its watching a funny movie that has us laughing like fools.  Sometimes it's just "a look" like they talk about in Parks and Rec, between BFF's.  When only the two of you will understand a LOOK.

Overall, if you can find someone as weird as you, and find odd things to laugh at that only the two of you would get..............that makes life worth living.

Hubby and I still LOL about Chia Pets from 30 years ago.  It didn't hurt that my Dad actually requested a Chia Pet for Xmas that next year for his big gift.  BTW, Chia Pets are actually awesome!

Edit:  It also doesn't hurt that we are also Star Wars/Star Trek nerds and.......vodka.

I think we can all agree that a sense of humour and a childlike enthusiasm for silliness is the key to not just long life, but a long love.

A few years back I was working in a huge warehouse, one day while picking an order up the back I came across two employees do the fusion dance from dragon Ball z, took them a few tries to get it right
Amazing!
how did you get this video of me and my wife?
i remember one time my ex and i took off our belts outside a cinema parking lot and had a belt whip fight and it was so fun
I‚Äôm impressed so many people haven‚Äôt seen this yet
How you know they a couple tho?  Looks like some straight friendzone shit to me lolol
That is incredibly sweet.
Alcohol could have been a factor
This made me smile so much how lovely
I have this. For 4 nearly years now. Best times of my life.
Those are beebs.
Man, those two are gonna go the distance.
Relationship goals
This is giving me hardcore brother and sister vibes. Mostly because that‚Äôs what my brother and I do pretty much constantly around each other. We also play ‚Äúassassin‚Äù. 

My mom told me not to pick on him cause he would be twice my size one day. I didn‚Äôt listen.
One of my favorite videos to exist ever!!!!!
This couples first date:

I blame LSD
If I meet a girl and she won't do this with me in a dark alley, she's not getting a ring
If thats not true love, I don't know what is
Dude I love that. So cute.
Best part of being on a nice relationship.
So cute
Just a couple of chaotic dumbasses. I love it.
After watching a jet Lee movie
Cool, but there was no reason to post this online.
Damn. Every six months or so, someone posts this and gets 50k+ upvotes. It‚Äôs a crazy cycle.
Guys like your karate kid kick is no match for my kame hame ha!
Love them.
"Couple having fun when they think nobody is watching" sounds more like it.
So... this is definitely a gay dude and his best friend who knew the camera was there, right?
Too much Cobra Kai
