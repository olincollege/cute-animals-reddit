That‚Äôs so wholesome
Lol, r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog

I think he thinks he‚Äôs mowing the lawn.

At least it‚Äôs not a can of soup
Seriously, the joy! It reminds me of the dog that found a clam. A CLAM! Still makes me happy.

'HE FINDS JOY' is the key to goodness in your life..
Trevor Noah is his spirit animal.
That‚Äôs some cat type shit right there
"Haha brick go brrrrr" - your dog probably.
Anyone know what breed he is? He looks a bit like my German shepherd boxer cross
Reminds me of the one phineas and ferb episode where they make perry as a toy and try to sell it to people.

"what is it?"

"its a plytapus"

"what does it do?"

Absolutely nothing and thats why it does absolutely everything."
'I love my brick' just like Father Jack. Wait until it's 'Feck off brick!'
All in all it‚Äôs just a ‚Äònother brick in the paw.
I wish I could be happy as easy as this good boy
It's a big beautifull old brick! 

The pioneers would ride those babies for miles.
Maybe hes been reading Wittgenstein
Looks like me when I was 5 with my hotwheels
Exactly like my toddler son... toys are good, yeah,, but stones, utensils or keys are much MUCH better
One man‚Äôs trash, is another dogs treasure

He's clearly mocking you and your purchase of toys!

That is the grin of a HAPPY dog.

Brick is pretty fun but have you tried Log?
Enjoy the little things
It's the simple things in life...

I mean...this *does* look like a very fun brick.
"Look at me, I'm a stupid human, just mowin' the lawn."
My dog never played with toys. I always bought him things and tried to engage in play, but he would either walk up to you and stand next to you so you could pet him, or he'd chase after the toy and then explore wherever it landed mostly ignoring the toy itself.

The most I've seen him play with a toy was take another dogs toy so it would chase him.
Brick brick brick it‚Äôs fun!
I think he needs a skate board
Owner: nooo you can‚Äôt play with that, when we bought you so many expansive toys!

Good doggo: haha brick go brrrm
I love the way he tosses his head around as he enjoys himself - clearly having a great time with his brick.

Where did you buy your treats from..
I dont know whats up with stone like things but like my dogs if she sees a rock laying around she lost it she cant stop playing with it.

You can‚Äôt blame him. He‚Äôs too cute to make fun of. And he is right, bricks are fun to play withüß±
This is the derpest shit I‚Äôve ever seen...and I absolutely love it
NOBODY BEATS THE BRICK
DID IT KINDLE JOY
This dog would be sick at mowing the lawn
My dads german shep had a thing for bricks too, until he came inside one day and had broken both incisors off one side.

When you‚Äôre cutting paper and the scissors start gliding
LOOK! 
IT *PUSH*
iM mOWinG thE LoWn
Lol I felt this. My dog will play with anything except the toys I bought for her
Because he isn't "programmed" to like stuff specifically "designed" and marketed for him.
It's the sound. The brick is hollow so it makes a unique sound when sliding on grass. Dogs have different hearing from human.
To be fair that brick looks fun as fuck
Brick goes vrrrrroooom!!!

He invented a lawn sled. So much so that autocorrect substituted different words 3 times for sled. The dog is a genius.
This is the same as my cat. 

Toys? Nope.

That small bit of his own fur that got caught in an updraft? Hell yeah.

He‚Äôs a slidey boi
Dogs built the pyramids.
He's so cute.
What a derpy guy. I think he's very imaginative.
Maybe he's been watching Trevor Noah's stand-up special where he talks about playing with a brick when he was a child in Africa.

In dog culture this is considered a brick move.

Brick. It‚Äôs fun.

Oh my god, this is grand. My dog loves decent sized rocks, just about brick size. Has never played with dog toys in last 11years. She just picks them up and drops them and then digs them out, kicks them and and moves them around. For hours she‚Äôll play, I swear. She just loves rocks. I wish I knew how to insert a video from my phone lol
This is awesome
Woo wooooo
To be fair, that looks like a pretty fancy brick.
[now, father...](https://youtu.be/ROcKPuPvcWU)
that's what my dog use to look like!
I have seen   bricks and  cinder blocks used to strengthen a dogs neck ,   they push them around the ground with their noses
I love it when dogs do that super weird long front leg stretch thing and pull their heads back.
That does look pretty fun to be fair...
haha brick go brrrrrr

I can just hear him going woOoOaAh

My pups play with their bones like that inside the house and eventually slide them under the furniture. Then immediately come to me to fetch them back out, all the damn time lmao.

Me at 8 yo. But then again, we had to invent our own toys. One present for Xmas, that was it...

All I needed was a breeze block. And a bit of an old bone.
Is this equivalent to a cat using the box instead of the bed/climbing tree thingy?
Trevor Noah is that you?

What a wonderful way to start the day! He is so busy and so proud of himself!!
He's like 'Choo Choo!!'
all in all we're just another brick in the wall

Get this dog a skateboard!
Never seen a dog do that
Thank you for the morning smile! My Lucy favors brushes. Any kind. Toothbrushes to brooms. She actually dragged my broom out of the room i was cleaning, when she was a pup.
I got my cat so many different toys, her favorite is a single piece of paper towel. She buries herself in it, then crumples it up and starts to rip it apart then she bats around the smaller pieces.
Haha my German Shepherd does this! He has one favorite rock he plays with.

Yeah, the only toys I get for my dog are tennis balls. He seems to get more joy out of a thick piece of rope, rolled up cardboard box or crushed 5L water bottle than anything I could buy for him.
Hahaha! My dog took a liking to a random rock when he was a puppy and he still has the same rock 6 years on and still loves it.
What kind of dog is this btw?
I bought my cat toys and her fav playthings are paper towels and plastic bags. She also loves playing with veggies.

That's what happens when your dog reboots during a firmware update. He's bricked..
Goofy butt! I love it
What breed is your dog? He looks 100% like our Gracie! <3
My late dog used to love bricks as well. No matter how much we tried to get him to stop playing with them, he'd always go back to them. He'd run around the garden with a brick in his mouth, or jump on the trampoline where he stored a few. By the end of his life, most of his teeth were completely destroyed, but he didn't seem to care. I miss that weirdo.
OOOIII LOOVE MOI BRICK

Yes he‚Äôs happy because a dogs main objective in life, when cared for, is to make his owners happy while laughing at their silly asses. People really should learn from dogs. This comes from a person who adopts too many doggies before euthanasia and I‚Äôm here to tell you all that this doggy knows he‚Äôs being a derp just to put a smile on everyone‚Äôs face around him.

Why do I feel like I‚Äôve been in that backyard
Anyone else wondering why there's, what looks like, a wooden floor from one end of the yard to the other?
One time when I was a kid we picked up this german shepherd that someone dropped off at the corner store. So my dad bitched at me for moving the cinder block around the yard because he would have to move it when he mowed. I had no clue what he was talking about and he kept getting on to me for it. Turns out the german shepherd was picking it up and carrying it around the yard as a toy. My dad apologised as we both saw him dragging this big brick around the yard. I miss that crazy doggo.
Dogs are to fucking pure for this world.

Brick, brick, brick, brick... It‚Äôs Fun!
Get that dog a skateboard!
He is so silly!
He looks like a cartoon ahahah.

Reason #865 why we don't deserve dogs
We had a St. Bernard when I was growing up that would only chase rocks. Not sticks, not balls, just rocks.

The downside to this was that there was always one available, and he'd torment you with them until you threw it for him.
What a goober. I love him.

Professionals have standards:)
Look at him go! üòç
Give this dog a mini lawn mower. I think it would work.
Awwww, it's Bob the builder's dog
I have balls, chew toys, and rawhide for my puppy to chew on.

She still brings in rocks, sticks, mulch from the backyard to chew on. Whyyyy????
It's the way of miyagi do dojo.
when that dog is done, s/he'll be a karate champ.
He‚Äôs learning how to push now. Next is teach him how to push a lawn mower.
This is so cute but if I look at it too long it becomes a bit uncanny. üòÇ
So cute!

I guess it's the same with cats, with so many toys, will end up playing with box's instead üòÇ
Just like when you get a child a toy, and the box is the most exciting part for them. Love it!
He's just trying his best to mow the lawn
It‚Äôs the little things in life
I bet r/slammywhammies would like this. Very cute!
The quirks we find in our pets are the most endearing parts.
Let him be man!
Oh man, we had a German Shepherd who also loved her brick... RIP Poppy
Them long long legs
Get this dog a boogie boar or skate board

Brick, brick, brick, briiick, brick, brick, brick, it‚Äôs fun.
Reminds me of in college when I was late to strength training, and my coach made me slide a bumper plate around the weight room face down multiple times. I was not having nearly as much fun
Yeah, but that‚Äôs the worlds best brick
Dog is actually undercover drug sniffing K-9 unit and found some ones hidden stash stuffed inside.
Dogs are weird...one time I looked in the backyard to see my pitbull tossing around/chasing after something suuuuuuper small. Rock? Clump of dirt? I went outside to investigate, and discovered my dog was playing with a pecan. A pecan.
Do they still make those metal Tonka toys dump trucks? That‚Äôs exactly how kids play with those, he‚Äôd probably get a real kick out of pushing that around.
Dogs are weird like that. My moms German Shepard plays fetch with a five gallon bucket and that‚Äôs the only toy she wants
That dog is the derp king/queen. That face when pushing the brick slayed me
He is playing with it like an absolute derp too lol
r/animalsbeingderps
This is the brick from phineas and ferb
"Brick brick brick it's fun"
What a derp!!
Doggo the builder
hes kinda moving the lawn
Aww cuteyüíú
Brooooommm
He‚Äôs mowing the lawn with it
"Activate maximum derpiness mode! They won't know what hit them!"

"A brick?"

"Well, yeah, a brick"
That DOES look like a fun brick though...
It seems as if he is screaming YEEET
BRICK BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
We got our 1st dog a year ago today and it took him a while to learn how to dog.  1st time I saw Obie playing with his tennis ball in the snow he was doing this.

&#x200B;

He's doing great now

No dog tax, sorry )-:
He just wants to mow the lawn!
I think your dag is broken lol
Wait what type of dog is that?
This is how I plan to raise my children
That‚Äôs a longass doggo. He seems like a fuckin horror movie representation of a dog
Lucky it wasn‚Äôt a can of soup. Those are dangerous.
farmer in a past life. trying to plow his field.
r/AnimalsBeingDerps
Hurr durr I‚Äôm a construction worker!
Just wait till he tries to chew it.
A company that I used to work for had a black lab that lived on the property. This dog was amazing. He took friendliness to a whole new level even for a breed known for being friendly. He was also the derpiest damned dog ever. He routinely ate rocks. The shop had a gravel driveway and this dog would just graze on the gravel. The owner finally had to pave the driveway to save the dog's teeth.
My dogs has the same we have loads of toys but she likes flowerpots (??) if that‚Äôs a word lol
r/whatswrongwithyourdog
I want to award this. My new favorite post ever
HIS brick.
Dear God they are evolving
That is the dopiest fucking dog I have seen in ages. I love him!
Get him a skateboard! Thats a skater dog!
Buy him a stroller or a trolley!
Introduce him to a lawnmower and you got it made...
ü§£ü§£ü§£
my dog finds his joy in a deflated soccer ball and a wood brick, rather than the tennis balls i bought a year ago
See? Would have been easier if it were soup.
Like a human baby. Give them a pile of toys, and they'll ignore them and play with a spatula for an hour.
He‚Äôs mowing the lawn
Nothing like a game of brick brick ya know?
I love this goofy sweetheart
I'M GOING SHOPPING
/u/vredditshare
DERP.
Hey, thats me when I was a kid
A story my sweetie tells is of a dog she and her ex-husband had before we met. I forget which dog this was - there have been MANY - but he or she loved collecting rocks. The'd carry rocks everywhere. Upon moving house, they found a pile of like a hundred tennis ball sized rocks in the crawlspace under the porch, that had been harvested from the property by the pup.
Me_irl
Just like small children, you give them a present and they are more interested in the box the gift came in! Lol.
That is pure happiness at its finest. What a sweet heart
"der look at me. I'm hooman and cutting my grass."
He just watched that one football movie where the dog plays on a team
The toys tought him theres joy to be found in thing
Those walls are amazingly high! Wish I had those between me and my neighbors.

The best toys.
Get this dog a skateboard
My GSD used to play with bricks and cinder blocks. She would claw at them and flip them over and over while play-barking at them. Dogs are special.
This is precious
Somebody should tweet this to Trevor Noah
Dogs are weird. I found my dog this morning, after my shower, on my bed having a conversation with herself and my clean underwear I had laid out. It went on for a bit until she turned around and finally noticed me. 

I wouldn't trade her for the world.
My dog is the same. He'll play with toys sometimes, but loves bricks and rocks, especially bricks.
SCOOCH POOCH
Train him to do chores for you
My dog rolls around medium sized logs with his head
Dog: the pupponeers used to ride these babies for miles
Now THAT is a ton of awards.
To be fair it looks like an awesome brick.
Big boy likes big toy.
Its the little things in life
I‚Äôm fairly certain it‚Äôs because he feels hella smart for finding his own toy
I  used to have some dog toys that you could put little treats and peanut  butter in and the dog would amuse herself until she got them all out.   (sorry, I don't remember the brand)  The brick looks like it is hollow  and the holes are about the right size to do the same thing.

If you think he loves the brick \*now\* he will \*adore\* it if it is loaded with treats that come out when he plays with it.
Give that slippy boy a skate board!
Brick Fucking Master
I love lamp
Look at me. I a Hooman. I do WERK. LMAO.
Happy, good boy!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
Doggo:  HAHA BRICK GO BROOM BROOM
You fool, he's weight training. Soon he will be the alpha
This is great.  He is so excited and proud of himself.  "Look Ma, look what I can do!"
Get him a boogie board.
‚ÄúNuff people say they know they cant believe.....Jamaica we have a bobsled team!‚Äù
Found the soundtrack. Enjoy!

This is the Trevor Noah of dogs.
My mate's dog was eating a brick one time
"I'm mowing the lawn just like my hooman!"
Absolutely adorable!!!
A very happy derp.
Look at my brick, my brick is amazing
Mine loves 2litter bottles.
He must be Italian
Walled backyard: this is Brazil.
r/animalsbeingderps
AND WE WERE HAPPY
My dog used to play with a bowling ball. Pushed it across the yard with his head. He was a dumb, but lovable shit
Thats one hell of a nice brick
he just discovered rear wheel drive
I dunno, he‚Äôs making that brick look pretty fun.
I don't think that's a brick. Idk what it is, but not a brick.
Your dog is nuts. And thank you so much for sharing it with us because it is f****** awesome
He has cat blood
Next u can teach him how to push a lawn mower!
Hahahaha this makes me almost as happy as he is
My dog loves playing fetch with rocks, he will also spend hours trying to find the rock I threw in the lake among the other rocks
"MUSH!"
Look at his head bobbly
‚ÄúPushing a rock, pushing a rock.‚Äù FHV (long time ago)
B R I C K
I am jealous of the dog
Is this an Anatolian Shepherd? They are my dream doggo
This is pretty much my 3 year old kid. She recently grabbed a 15mm crescent wrench during an unauthorized shoeless trip into the garage, and has been insisting on keeping with her at all times ever since. She even takes it to bed and stashes it under her pillow.
Don‚Äôt be mad at him he just wanted to help mow the lawn
Brick go vroom.
üéµPushin my brick downtown...üé∂
‚ÄúPushing a brick pushing a brick...‚Äù lol
Best toys can sometimes be the cheapest
This is cats. They never play with the toys you buy. Just some random slightly circular piece of garbage they hid somewhere.
I don't know why but I found this hilarious.
Haha.. my dog used to like rolling big rocks around, this reminds me of that but it's even more ridiculous to watch.
Get him one of those push mowers. Free up those Saturday mornings.
What a good boy, he's messaging and exfoliating your lawn for you.
Same thing with kids and boxes
This reminds me of a Phineas and Ferb episode, "Brick Brick Brick Brick Brick.. It's Fun!"
Nobody beats the brick
Is this the most gilded post ever?
Cant get past the dogshit
He pooosh it!
I think he's enjoying the stretch in his fore legs.
He must be antifa
My fur baby has many toys and yet enjoys playing with my socks.
My nearly 50kg good girl dug up a big rock in the ground and yelped like a puppy while pushing that thing around, back then I didn't have a camera to capture it, but damn, that sight is forever in my brain.
Just another brick in the r/aww
And people say dogs aren‚Äôt comparable to babies
This adorable pupper is over here getting ready for either his first landscaping or construction job
Hahahahaha the joy!! Thx!!
Lol! I love how he looks like he's really enjoying himself! So much fun! üòç
Lol the awkward sliding is great
This dog is the biggest goober I've ever seen. Hilarious
now imagine giving him a brick with a rug at the bottom and you have him play inside the house
other toys: \*exists\*

dog: brick goes brrrrrr
Why the brick is hollow ? I haven't seen em in my area.
Looks like me when mom let's me push the shopping cart.
r/AnimalsBeingDerps lololol
I am remembering an episode in Phineas and Ferb in which they sold bricks as a toy and it became a hit. Similar vibes.
This is the most beautiful, derpiest derpster I have laid eyes on band I love him.
u/vreditdownloder
This is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen!

Brick brick brick brick it‚Äôs fun
My dog used to carry around a 5 lb barbell for fun.
Ingenuity. Creativity. A true inventor.
Taking pages out of Phineas and Ferb I see?
Well, phinieas and ferb taught us something
Funny, i have bought my dog so many toys and his favorite is his old harness from when he was a puppy he loves to lay on his back and chew on it.
LMAO.  Ours is the same way.  A whole YARD full of toys, but nope, he'll go and pull a whole LOG out of the stack for our stove and push it around just like this.  Hey, at least he's happy?
That fucking slide, holy shit
üé∂ Brick brick brick brick brick brick brick brick Its fun! üé∂ *honk*
That's animals for ya
YEEAAH! I'M A BRICK DOG NOW
r/whatswrongwithyourdog
Get him a skateboard or some rollerblades!
Same with my Luke.  He has plenty of toys but finds joy in a plastic fork. I don't even know how he got it Smh
Trevor Noah would appreciate this. I believe one of his favourite toys as a child was a brick! ü§£
It‚Äôs the simple things in life
Aw he is having so much fun! I wonder what breed he is?
This is like my cat with pegs and pen caps. She has such expensive toys. But give her one of these and she loses her fucking mind
This is so over the top with the head wiggling and the tongue sticking out his mouth, it looks like a cartoon, I love it
Cute
Dogs are strange creatures.
Like a cat with a box
r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog
Dude I don‚Äôt usually comment but what the actual fuck this is so adorable!!!
He seems to have stumbled upon some sort of brick propulsion system.
I had a German shepherd and his favorite toy was a random ass peice of oak wood. He loved it for his teeth while he was young and just never let go of it
But do the other toys *sliiiiiiiiiiiide* ??
;; omg he looks so happy
Quarter Brick Half Brick Whole Brick Ay!
My cat has so many toys but she fucking plays with her own SHIT ANDTHE FUCKIN DOOR ;-;
I had a dog that used to do this and a friend of mine had another from the same litter also did the same thing. Wonder if its hereditary...
I wish I had simple pleasures like this, but no, here I am hopelessly browsing Reddit on an overpriced gaming PC, full of ‚Äùboring‚Äù games...
r/AnimalsBeingDerps
Brick go burrrrrrr.
I feel like he‚Äôs mocking humans mowing the lawn lol
What you have there is called a skating dog.  Give him some plastic,grocery bags and let him skate around with those.  My cats love grocery bag skating on the carpet.üòé
Epiphany: He thinks anything toy-sized is a toy, and is fascinated that there can be a hard, non-squeaky "toy."
I once had a friend/roommate tell me that she was a better cat owner than me because she bought more toys for her cats than I did. I‚Äôve had cats my entire life and I can confirm that every time they‚Äôd have toys bought for them, they‚Äôd prefer to play with the bag it came in. You don‚Äôt need to spend a fortune to entertain your pets xD
B R I C K
That's adorable
The new ‚ÄúGO Brik‚Äù from slobber toys! Its for the dog on go! *Requires doggo to gogo*
He a motorcycle
ITS VERY BEAUTIFUL TO ME - this dog 2/9/20
He's using his imagination, I used to play with nothing at all and pretend I was playing a videogame.
Like their slogan says,

"It's fun."
Needs a Jolly Ball
Reminds me of [this dog Tobi](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog/comments/gebx53/interesting_toy_choice_note_this_isnt_my_dog_just/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Funny thing, we see a person doing this we say wtf is wrong with this tweaker, a dog does this and we be like, awww
You won't be laughing when you come outside to a sturdy double bricked house built to code.
My dog LOVES this old cannonball at my grandparents' house, I think the weight of it despite not being that big is interesting to dogs, like the brick.
Its the little things in life that matter...

















Tho the brick may be bigger than the other toys.
Give that dog a lawnmower
I guess he thinks it's a lawn mower
