Use an old toothbrush as well, they tend to like that.

edit: Please thoroughly clean the brush before using one on a cat.
That is too cute
Therefore he has earned the much needed chin scritches ‚ô•Ô∏è
my cat licks the side of my hands expecting me to pet his head with that side lol
I want to hear this so bad! Even though I can hear what my childhood cat would have been doing in my head I still want to hear this super cute cat as well.
[Cat saliva](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-05/venomous-primate-toxin-helps-show-why-cats-not-into-you/11931952) is "a really novel area of research and one which I think we'll be having lots of fun with."

"We analysed the DNA sequence of the protein in slow loris venom and, much to our surprise, it's virtually identical to what cats have all over their fur that makes people allergic to them,"
So I mean there was a part of me that legit thought you were going to physically lick your cat.
- this blew up, RIP inbox
I dont know why BUT I could watch that all day. He's just a happy Puddy Cat ...
Grooming is a super important part of colony bonding for cats, you‚Äôre part of his colony and he trusts you!
My sister's cat was trapped in having to wear a protective collar for quite a while. I helped her clean up by doing the same thing as shown in the video and I must say, she really appreciated it!

Haha so adorable!
Meowtually beneficial relationship.
Wow I adore this
My cat does this too. You know how they lick their paw, put it behind their ears, and then drag it forward to clean their ears/heads? She sometimes enlists me do that for her by licking the side of my finger.
Perfect for reading and turning pages lol
Oh my god that‚Äôs so adorable I can‚Äôt even
ok groomer
Y‚Äôall know that little giggle Ron Swanson does when he‚Äôs very amused/excited? I‚Äôm pretty sure that exact sound just came out of my mouth. This is absolutely precious.
My cat dose this to
Khajit is unfamiliar with these methods
It bugs me you didnt even attempt to get the top of his head and kept going over his left eye. Then again I've seen cats groom themseslves and it doesnt always look like it wa some evenly.
Omg was that ADORABLE!!!!!
Team work makes the clean work!
Basically what my mom used to do to me to fix my hair as a kid. True love.

My cat licks my finger all the time when I boop his nose. I wonder if he's asking me to help groom him as well.
You got rescued by a cat!!!
This right here makes me want to go an adopt a cat- I have a dog, two turtles and a couple of aquariums... But.. but look at that!
aww this reminds me of the cat I had when I was a kid, if I booped her nose she would lick my finger
This is the most wholesome thing I will see all day. Thank you. In a world like this we all need a video to put a smile on our face. Also thank you for rescuing him!
This cat has broken the limit to their inherent laziness.

Do you usually wash you wand afterwards or just leave it?
Mlem mlem mlem mlem mlem
I had a cat who you lick your hand and rub her head on the same spot. She knew what's up.
Rest in Peace, Jasmine, you drooling fool.
Your cat is majestic. That is all.
Very nice hoooman... now my butt hole if you please.
I thought this was going to go down Angela Martin street at first!
*Me and my cat in the room*

*He lets me help him groom*

*Go ahead, let it resume*

*And watch his little face bloom*

this is ~~motherfucking~~ adorable
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen something as cute and as precious as this... Gotta go cry now. Too much emotion.
No, your cat has trained you to do his grooming for him.
My cats just meow a lot and stick their buttholes in my face
Just one of 1300+. But this is way too cute!!
THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON THE INTERNET!! ahhhh so cute!
Oh dear god. Too adorable.

Why is my cat a literal spawn of demon while people have cats like that
/u/vredditshare
Truly living like a king.
Happy kitty, He‚Äôs hit the jackpot!
I also have a rescue cat and she‚Äôs great! (A total nutter, but great!)
Omg. My late Norwegian Forest Cat used to let me do that. Although being a NFC meant that he had a lot of grooming for us to take care of anyway.
My cats jump on my lap for attention, even when I‚Äôm on the toilet lol. I‚Äôve literally described one of them‚Äôs clingiest as a quote ‚ÄúBarnacle on a rock or sometimes my arse‚Äù
My cat looks like yours a lot and he does that with everyone in my family
u/vredditdownloader
So jealous right now.
Now I miss my cat...
My cat licks my hand and then rubs hard to lick areas (such as the sides of her face) against said hand.
He prepping for his big date.
most chill cat on earth
I also had a rescue cat who did that!  So cute!
Please if you ever in search of and committed for a new pet to be in your family, check your local shelters/rescues :(
My baby did this when she got spayed and had to wear the cone of shame so she couldn‚Äôt clean her face! They‚Äôve got us trained well haha
OKay... that's it... I'm done. I'll be watching this the rest of the day... fuck adulting, this is my happy place.
My old cat used to let me do this! I thought it was so sweet and a huge sign of trust. :)
Clean up on isle 3, my heart just melted.
Haha. That‚Äôs funny. That cat must be really happy to have you
My cat does this, too. :D
He now regrets not acquiring human servants long ago.
My husband does this with our cat. She'll lick his thumb and then he'll groom the top of her head. It's adorable.
It's because this pointy pink dot on its head is a button that extends the tongue
He probably just likes the taste of your skin
One of the cats I had growing up would let you do this. He would practically beg for it! Any time he would be on your lap he would try to lick, and he‚Äôd purr louder than any cat I‚Äôve ever heard if you kept the pattern of lick-pet-lick-pet up. 

We got him from a litter of barn cats. My brother and I were fishing in the neighbors pond and the kittens came out. We left and they were following us and even though we tried to lose em they followed us all the way home which was at least a half mile. We decided to keep one (the neighbor offered us as many as we wanted), and we kept the only male. He was all white with a black tail, and a black ‚Äúbeauty mark‚Äù to the side of his nose. He was a vocal cat and is the only cat I‚Äôve ever had that came when called (without a treat incentive). He passed a few years ago, after living 16-18 years. 

Thank you for sharing your video, it brought back so many fond memories of my old friend, Oreo!
That is the cutest fking thing I‚Äôve seen
Dis one lucky hooman
This is the best thing I have ever seen
Ahh this made me want to leave work and go pet my kitties lol! Awesome bond!
Literally the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen today!
My cat has abnormally bad breath, and this would end up with both of us smelling like garbage.
My cat will allow me to do this :) she was start licking my hands so wherever she licks, I‚Äôll rub on her neck, rinse repeat. We‚Äôre just slaves to them
It‚Äôs so aggressive
Haha that is awesome. One of my cats meticulously rubs his whole face on my chin after I havent shaved for a couple days. I think he thinks the rough whiskers are my spikey cat tongue üòÄ
Mine does this! I aliken it to getting the kid to spit on the hankie
OH! Is that what my cat is trying to get me to do?! I shall do that for her tonight.
My cat does something similar. He would cuddle and lay on my hand. He would then lick my whole hand and then rub his face on it several times  and then start the process again. lol
My cat does the exact same thing!! It‚Äôll lick my hand and then head butt my hand to get me to wipe her whiskers. Such weird animals.
See this is the kind of cat I want! Snuggly and not aggressive. Any tips for a first time cat owner on how to get a cat like that???
Gonna be real useful when you have a stack of envelopes to seal.
I used to do this for the one side of the face my 3 legged cat couldn't reach :)
In uncertain times like these, this post makes me smile.
Omg my clingy cat does this. I thought she was grooming my finger then rubbing her face on my finger for pets cause it was there. And I was like cool I'll just rub your spit back on your face so it's not on my finger anymore. Win win. Now I feel honored and will make more of an effort to lick my cat properly.
Too cute
/u/wobkeb moest je wel ff taggen
So cute. My cats love to lick my hand but never want my help to wash him x)
I've never seen something like this but I love it. That is so sweet.
I needed this today lol
MY CAT DOES THIS TOO AND ITS TOO CUTE FOR THIS WORLD
He trained you well!
mine does exactly the same lol
Didn‚Äôt know I needed this. Thanks.
Omg! How beautiful! I have the same cat! They are really loving!üíñ
what an honour ü•∫
My female cat lets me do this, AND SHE GROOMS ME BACK!!!

I‚Äôm not even remotely making this up and could prob take a video of the process.
Lick him yourself you coward.
You just made me understand that my cat has been trying to get me to do this too
"Clean me peasant"
omg MY HEART
Your cat found the right home.
My cat doesn't even like when we're in the same house together.
"Allows"

We all know he has you broken and enslaved to his will.

Oh man too good, I die.
So they‚Äôre just spreading saliva all over the face? 

COVID-19: *breathing intensifies*
I can confidently say that is the first time I have ever seen a cat do that.
The one time I actually said "Hehehe" üò∏
MY CAT DOES THIS TOO! I thought she was just weird
My friends cat used to let me do that for him. 

RIP Red, I miss you buddy‚ô•Ô∏è

You should trick them to lick your finger to turn a page.

You are a good teamüêæ
What a beautiful cat!!!
He has trained you well.
My cat does this too!
I have been trying to get this with my baby cat (was a stray)
I thought all cats do this
My cat Narnia lets me do that as well !! Even though she does thoroughly clean herself as well.
And if I haven‚Äôt helped in too long she just... persistently licks my hand until I give in.
You may not be aware of this: but this is rather adorable.
Doctors: it's important to avoid touching your face during the pandemic

Wait... so the reason they lick your hand while grooming is to make you help them groom?
That‚Äôs so adorable!

I did this as a kid with my cat, I just kind of thought they licked me because they wanted me to help clean them.
My cat does this too! Also, trying to use my fingers to clean her ears...
Teamwork !
Spoiled has reached a new level.
That's so adorable it brought a tear to my eye.
Was anyone else afraid this was going to be a video of her licking the cat?

So glad it was adorable instead.
"No! You got that spot already, do the other side please."
So so cute!
That is so intelligent!
My Kitty does this too. I love it!!
Same with mine. When im going to sleep he licks my fingers to wash him its too cute
hands down one of the cutest videos to exist on the internet

How did this start? Does he always let you help groom him? I gotta know

Wow. Amazing
My cat bites me when i get too close....
Ive never seen a cat do this before.  What a sweet animal
This is by far one of the cutest things I've ever had the pleasure of watching.

I miss my cat, she was like the Marla Singer of the cat world.
I love the fact that he doubled down on the licking on one part of his forehead like he's saying "wait that part needs extra saliva!"
Sounds like ripping a piece of tape haha
Can he help you turn the pages of a book as well?
This is adorable. I wish my cat would let me do like that
I'm dead. That's the cutest thing I've ever seen!!!!
What a lovely little fellow

You made my day, thank you!!
Best video of the day!
My cat used to do this too. I called her so lazy. I still helped her all the time. RIP Amber, you are greatly missed.
Ok, cutest thing I‚Äôve seen today.
People always be like "cats tongues are so weird & gross"  


But once you fall in love with them, it's kind of cool & not really that bad.   


My friends cat will just lick my legs non-stop if I'm wearing shorts, I don't even notice it now.
My heart swells! So precious.

I hold my cats tail near his mouth so he has an easier time cleaning it.  I think he appreciates it.
Anything to avoid bath huh. Cute!!
Good
My little girl does the same for me, so adorable
 Cats love when you groom them and clean places they can‚Äôt easily reach too. So awesome.
That might just be the most adorable thing I‚Äôve seen here. And this is r/aww
I love that. My cat does the same thing and wants nose scritches
Haha. My cat does that.
My cat does the same thing. I think she is trying to teach us how to groom ourselves
I would die painfully for himb.
"The humans have been trained to groom me, and enjoy doing so. Our takeover goes well."
This is too much for my heart, soul and eyes ..
Remember catdog
I'm for sure gonna do this now at some point. He always licks my hand before he lays his noggin on my arm, as well as when I pet his lower back, so I'll easily be able to train him to know I'm gonna rub his smell all over him.
What level of spoiled is this? That's hilarious
Ok, you guys win the Adorable prize.

I just got four cavities because this is so fucking sweet.
Wow
Where did you rescue your cat?
Don‚Äôt forget behind the ears
This makes me want to get a new cat.
I had a cat from the animal welfare league that would happily let me hold his leg while he licked his arse and tail. We'd also go hunting flies on the ceiling, him standing on my hands as we chased them around the house. <First cat name> was a lover, he quietly laid there while my two year old daughter dressed him in her bangles. Sadly he died, suspiciously straight after my wife brought home Lilies. <Second cat name>, the next one, is not so much a lover, but he's my boy. He's coming with me when I move out of the former matrimonial home.
look at a close-up image of a cat's tongue... hint: no.

Holy shit, this is the most purest thing I've ever seen
We have a 3 legged one who does this! She has a hard time getting to her left eye and ear. She'll just start licking my hand and rubbing her face into it when she needs help.
My grandmother rescues wild and exotic cats and we have a full blood savannah named Melvin he cannot be released back to the wild though because his eyesight is bad but he is like my best friend now he lets me help him groom just like that he comes when he is called even plays fetch.
That's a funny looking dog.

That so damn cute. First reading the title I was scared I woulld see someone licking their pet. It was a relief
SOMEONE had to initiate this behavior for the first time. 

It was you wasn't it.
I love this so much.
Aww, he really trusts and loves you, he looks so relaxed and happy. So sweet.
My diabetic cat does this.
Very cute! My cat does this too, and sometimes just chases my hand to lick me. When I started wearing rings she used to try to bite them off.
He looks so happy *heart implodes*
That is pretty damn adorable
 That‚Äôs so cute!
My princess let's me do that. It's the most precious bonding time ever. Easy to see why they help each other after your own cat has let you help them.

awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Same! My cat will also lick my face if I put it in front of his mouth. I put my cheek down for ‚Äúkisses‚Äù often.
You're so lucky!
My cat used to do this without my consent. She always licked my hand frantically and then used my hand to groom hard to reach places like the back of her head. I felt like I was used, but at the same time I allowed it to happen. #MeowToo

The businesslike manner in which the grooming was performed is...immensely pleasing.
This is so wholesome I love you and your cat.

My rescue cat does the same thing. When she‚Äôs finally had enough she‚Äôll climb up and try to groom my face. It only took one lick for me to realize what a bad idea that was. Felt like she was taking off my skin üòÇ

Mine does this also...
How cute !!
looks like a mini tiger uwu
Oh my god, this is incredibly precious
My Maine coon encourages me to groom him by licking my hand, then rubbing his head underneath. However he looks way more relaxed when I help him, since I go more slowly, like a massage.
Portable stamp licker
My allergies are kicking in just watching this, but very cute.
That's so cute.  Cats are smarter than we give them credit for
Can I haz?
All cats let you do it
Except you arent helping him at all.
What a cutie
Easy come, easy go.
I've never seen that before, cute baby
That‚Äôs adorable! Rosie is great. Slept with Logan quietly all night!
Well there's something I didn't know I needed to see today. Thank you.
I can watch this all day
My Morticia would let me do this with her as well. I miss her.

So lovely!
Well fuck I sure do like that
Awesome
Lucky hooman!
Nice
At least the owner is a willing and active participant. I used to be woken in the night by my cat using my shoulder as a flannel. Wetting it with his tongue then giving his face a good old rub down on it.
I don't know anything about cats, but is that what the cat is actually trying to do? Or is the cat just licking the finger?
My cat forces me to help her by licking the hell out of my arm and then rubbing her neck on it
*my precious*
if only my demon cat let me do that
I came to Reddit this morning for some anxiety relief and this was the very first post I saw... Your cat has soothed me from afar!
This üíô
Genteee
u/vredditshare
My cat mr. Baby would force me to do this. He'd sink his claws into my hand and pull it to his face. Then lick my fingers a few times, then move my hand to the top of his head. It then got to the point where I learned this is what he wanted and would offer a finger to lick and then I'd wipe his head, neck, and face. But if I tried to stop he would often times catch my hand on the retreat and reel it back in to his mouth for a punishing bite, then continued kicks for more cleaning .
You've gotta be kitten me
Your both literal angels and I really needed this shit today. Thank you.
I‚Äôve watched this 18 times
That's cool and my cat does it all himself by licking his paws (probably normal).
Wholesome af
One of my cats does the same thing, she will lick my fingers then push her head underneath so I can wipe her face. It's so stinking cute.
that makes me nearly cry
This is the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. You have infiltrated animal world. Keep posting, we need updates from the inside!
This is a new level of laziness
This is precious.
u/vredditshare
I can‚Äôt believe I never thought to do this!
I was literally going to post a video of my cat doing the same thing. I've been thinking about it for months, but I don't really do videos of myself, even just hands. All those internet points I missed out on.
>She‚Äôs now coming to the rescue.
Purrfect team building exercise
I mean... they only said we aren‚Äôt supposed to touch our OWN faces. Carry on.
Oh my God... This is next level cuteness...
Adorable!!!!  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

That‚Äôs so wholesome, and your little friend is adorable

My cat makes slurping sounds when he uses his tounge to lick his leaky butthole
I do not like cats whatsoever, buuuuut....damn this is cute af
My dog does the same it's so adorable seeing this cat and my dog enjoying it
Mine does the same thing. ‚ù§
u/vredditdownloader
My cat does a version of this and it makes me melt like an idiot. He'll lick my hand and wait for me to pet him with it, and then decide I'm not doign it right and clean himself. I love that idiot.
r/vredditdownloader
Such a nice furball...
Hmmm
AWWWWW
I‚Äôve had a rough morning. This makes me so freaking happy I cannot even begin to explain. Thank you for sharing his cuteness with us. üôèüèΩ
Worker smarter, not harder
My cat does this!!! She also leans her head down for me to give it kisses and boops. AND she meows after I cough or sneeze, every. single. time. 

She so sweet.
The title scared me at first. I thought I was going to watch someone licking their cat haha. Very cute though!
you are a slave to that cat, you know......
That's so cute
My cat does the same. I put my thumb in front of her face and she licks it and then leans it into my thumb. It's so cute.
u/vredditdownloader
Allows you? You got trapped. From here on out, you do the grooming!
omg looks like my cat - are there white boots beside the white fluffy breast?
My boy also does this.
I just ‚Äúawwed‚Äù but screaming because this is so cuuuuute
My part feral girl cat does the same.
make me purr-fect



im funny
My old cat used to do this!
Kinda gross
This is one of the cutest things I've ever seen, thank you for posting this. It made my day.
Mine does this too! üòª
Smell your finger.
so damn cute
Meanwhile, my rescue cat treats my hands like scratching posts. Trying to find a home for her, but it won't be easy if this behavior doesn't subside.
He would come in handy when going through a stack of paper.
Wow. My Wall-E allows me to do the same thing. Helps him out when he‚Äôs sleepy.
Worker smarter, not harder.
Khajiit has licks if you have cleans
Me next.
I could watch this all day.
Oh! My! God! This is adorable!
Nice rescue cat. Is he a paramedic or something?
Oh my goodness. That‚Äôs adorable!
u/vredditdownloader
I would like to know how does the cat tongue feels ?
My rescue boy loves it when I do this. Idk if it's lazy or the shape of his paws/legs but he always struggles to do this to his own face, so when he starts licking my finger I just rub his head with it
Now THATS cute!
u/vRedditDownloader
I hope you swap places afterwards, you know, to be fair.
/u/vredditshare
You forgot to get behind the ears. Geezus!
My little Kallie used to do this with me. Then afterward she would lick my face. She passed away on 2/25/20. I miss you :(
Yes.
Omg I can‚Äôt stop watching lmao
I'm scared to show my cat this. He'll want this all the time.
u/vredditdownloader
You and that cat are both weirdos.  But then, that's mainly why I like cats, they're weirdos.
There‚Äôs no better feeling in this world for pet owners/lovers when they trusts you.
We don't deserve cats
üß°
That is one adorable, wonderfully loved and spoiled kitty cat. Thanks for the smiles
My cat lets me do this to her haha. And you have such a beautiful cat üòä
My kitty does this too. He's too good for this world! ‚ô°
Not be overdramatic or anything, but I would die for your cat
No offense but ü•∫
This is peak reddit
This is the best thing in the whole wide world.
AWWW YISS
Oh my lord this is A D O R A B L E
Cute ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫

This made me smile!
u/vredditdownloader
That is adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è
The cat.....they have evolved.
Cute
Oh my goodness that is just the cutest thing!
I never pay for gold, but I did for this post.
Awe haha my cat does that too!!! The best part is that when a stop she usually returns the favor and starts grooming my hair or my arms lol
that's awesome!
My cat does this sometimes, except for her she nuzzles my hand, licks it, nuzzles more, and keeps repeating until she‚Äôs done. Seems to prefer that I keep my hand still, too.
Anyone else think this is grim
