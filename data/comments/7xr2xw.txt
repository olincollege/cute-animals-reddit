My dog does the same thing with his paws and it's hilarious.
He is excited that there are so many people to pet him
Not quite the same, but I often put pictures of puppies up on the screen in the middle of exams to help calm students’ nerves. It’s kinda funny how many people will genuinely stare at them for a moment and smile before going back to work.
I’d be distracted the entire time wanting to give the good boy a belly rub. 
The dog got a perfect score on the exam.
I used to have a professor that brought his bulldog to class, but the dog would wander the lecture hall and then randomly fart a disgustingly toxic cloud. 
The college I used to go to always had therapy dogs in the library during mid terms and finals. Usually at least 5 dogs, all different shapes and sizes. My favorite was this huge cuddle bug mastiff. I think he made me cry he was so sweet and blubbery.
Final bonus question, worth 20% of the grade: “what is my dog’s name?”

Edit: To make this even more sinister you could make this an optional question, get it right? 20 grade points added, get it wrong however it’s 40 grade points *off*. “Would you like to play a game?”
And nobody mentioned how jacked the prof is, do you even realize how much work is needed to get that body, especially at that age? Respect!
Eats exam mid way through 
Buff professor with awesome dog.
This is a greater swiss doggo right? they are such a funny breed! 
my last girlfriend was afraid of dogs. And a medical student. This would not have worked well for her.
Cuteness....too.....overpowering....(blanks on exam because of doggo)...

Well thanks guy.
Bibi has been hitting the Gym.
Boy I hope nobody in the class had a dog phobia. Worked for a guy who regularly brought his dogs into the office, and my coworker was afraid of dogs, and it made a lot of things harder.
I hope no once is afraid of dogs. 
omg what a giant DOOF
Looks like he’s cheering all the students on! 
The dog looks pretty relaxed, seems to have worked.
Somebody better of gave that good boy some scratches and a belly rub or else heads will roll.
It's a Swissy!  
Doggo: "Am I doing this right? Do you feel calm?"
My nerves are not only calmed but tickled 
I wish professors could get paid extra for having a certified therapy dog, just so awesome stuff like this could be more common.
What a cute little show-off
I'm bout to fucking bomb this test, probably fail the class, but that is one *cute* dog!
Wait I know that dog! I took this teacher's class five years ago, and he brought his dog in for our final too. Glad to see he's still doing it!

This teacher is one of the best guys you'll meet. He's a successful venture capitalist who hosts an entrepreneurship class at a local community college just so he can give back and help inspire people. I took away a lot from the class - although I learned more from his stories and life lessons than from the actual course content (one of the questions on his final was "How do you spell Entrepreneurship?" Haha).

Keep doing you, teach!
I have a phobia of dogs so this would put me right on edge.
My professor brings in his dog for the same reason and everyone feeds the good boy snacks.
Good effect on target. Nerves calmed. Over and out.
Somebody rub that tummy and fast!! 
what a clown. 
Good boy. 
His teaching methods seem a bit abstract. But his dog, on the other hand, is a fucking genius. 
What is this dog on, and can I have some?
[deleted]
That's too cute, I'd fail the class if that dog were brought in every day!
*Free him*.
I want sound!
/r/AirSwimming 
Wait what if your afraid of dogs!?
Row, row, row yer boat!
Gently down the stream!
Merrilymererymalary!
Life is but a dream!
I couldn’t take a test with a dog that derpy in the room
I'm very allergic to dogs, it would be really difficult for me to take an exam if this dog was there. Cute doggo and it's a really lovely sentiment from the teacher, I just think people with allergies are sometimes forgotten when people bring animals to places others are working and studying (Like when my colleague brought her dog into work and my asthma and eczema completely flared up.)
Rub his belly you monster!
A Swissy!!!!! 

I wish there were more greater swiss mountain dogs in the world.

Hey I’ve got a Swissy too! Such wonderful beautiful dogs that you hardly ever see on Reddit 
Oooh, is that a Swissie? I have a Swissie at home!
How can I be expected to take a test with such a cute Swiss Mtn Dog flopping about!? 
I wish more professors would do it
SWISSY!!!!
I have a lot of respect for the kind of teacher/professor that cares enough about his or her students to put a conscious effort into alleviating pre-test nerves. I also have a lot of respect for dogs :o)
When my mom was a girl, her dog Snowball followed her to school and the teacher spanked him with her wooden paddle. It was a different time. 
Doing the barkstroke.
It looks like he is having a bad dream about waking up late on exam day and is forced to sprint through campus so that the professor doesn’t lock the door in his face. 

I still have that dream 20 years later. Maybe because I had to sprint through campus twice in real life. The most realistic dreams are based in your experiences.
Someone rub the good boy’s belly!
Dog.exe has stopped working
Everywhere he goes... bitches always know...
My favorite teacher in high school was blind and had a guide dog. She was the best sweetest lab and usually spent the day sleeping (and farting) under his desk. But when we had exams, she could always sense our nerves and would run up and down the aisles asking for pets to calm us down. 10/10 best doggo
Well, it definitely worked, I don't think that dog's going to have any trouble with that exam.
I’ve only had cats my entire life, but gifs like this continue to cement my determination to get a dog once I’m out of college...and financially stable...
plot twist: he was giving the class all the test answers in Morse code with his paws
SiCk PrOfEsSoR MaKeS cLaSs WaTcH hElpLesS DoG dIe In CoNtortiOns 
Is this ASU?? I saw him on Snapchat this morning I think, unless someone else’s business professor brought the same dog ☺️
"Just keep swimming"
I appreciate the intention, but there's no way I could pay attention to class with a G O O D B O Y E right there.
I'm a glass blowing student at BGSU and my prof brings in her bulldog Frank everyday to class! He runs around the studio and is in general the goodest boy I've ever seen :) we just celebrated his 12th birthday in class yesterday! 
And everybody failed their exams because they were too busy going "aww" looking at the dog. But it was worth it dammit!

For fucks sake someone please give that fella a belly rub 
[deleted]
I can’t help but think about people with allergies. It would completely ruin their final exam.
My yellow lab that I loved used to do that early in the mornings. It always brought a smile to my face when I saw her on the floor doing what ever in the world this is. Sadly she passed away about a year ago. I’ll never forget you girly! <3
Too bad for the kids that are scared of dogs...
And then the exam is ruined for the allergic dude. Such a nice act!
This would be bad for my ADHD...

Fuck you exam **look at him** he *needs pets now*!!!
As an IT person who worked at a college, that was making me nervous waiting for the dog to get caught on the many visible, messy cabling in that classroom...
"You didn't answer a single question on the exam..." 

"No, but I pet your dog for 90 minutes straight."
I would fail the exam, but score perfect marks on petting 
Nobody is listening to what that professor is saying. 
It's all fun and games until someone who is allergic to dogs gets hospitalised and misses their exam!
The doge is creating the ultimate business formula for success on it’s imaginary pawboard. 
Just a question, so please don't murder me: how is that allowed? Where I live dogs are not allowed near schools. What if there was a person who was allergic to dogs who simply had a class in that ROOM? Even if they weren't there when the dog was, the dog will still leave fur and dandruff to aggravate their allergies.

Wew.
Massive annoyance for people who dislike dogs and/or suffer from allergies. Hope he asked if everyone was on board and even then no one’s going to be that one person to say no...
Except the people that are deadly afraid of dogs. Pretty inconsiderate really to force a kid to do their test locked in a room with something they really don't like.
Yeah I would complain. Hate this culture of dogs being ok to be anywhere.
It would honestly terrorize me, as I have a phobia of dogs
Yeah... I really hope no one is allergic... Because being forced for hours in a room with a dog like that is terrible.
Looks like the dog is gonna take the test too and is freaking out. 
I mean any excuse to bring your dog to work.
I think I would be *more* nervous because I'd want to give him tummy rubs so bad
I wouldn't do well because i would want to pet the good boy
I feel better already
#Everybody got an A!
Such good strat. I too wouldnt care about a thing except playingnwith such doggo
Nothing will ever be as happy as a dog
My dog does that too! 
excuse me professor, your dog ate my exam
I kind of want to see the dog take off after something, bringing the desk, computer, monitors, etc. with him in tow...
So, did it help calm the professor's nerves? 
Hopefully someone said "I'd be *way* more calm if he could sit next to me while I took the exam"
Why was he nervous? Was it his first time teaching & examining a class?
Clearly a cool prof! He really care for his students 
That will do...
That prof looks like my microeconomics prof...
That dog certainly has no nerves
My nerves are calm af after watching this gif. Thanks OP! 
And the whole class failed because no one got any work done
This is amazing to me.  Good job professor! 
Guys I swim lol
A I R S W I M M I N G
It's a trap to get you to lower your guard! Don't listen to him! Increase stress levels!
I'll have what he's having.
The best kind of dog

Completely nutts
My calc professor brought her dog in a few times when I was in her class. She let him run around and play with people while she taught, it was awesome.
It’s super effective!
I don't have any exams but am calmer now.
Fuck that exam, I'd sit and pet the dog instead 😂
I work as university staff in study abroad. I usually have between 3-5 students in a day advising. Wish I could bring mine to work. Thinking about having him at least join us at our study abroad fair.
I see the dog found someones weed stash
I think i would stress me more than it would calm my nerves
Oh no he is having a seizure he needs 10 pets stat.

 Its so adorable and distracting that I wouldnt be able to take the test.
 Please get that cutie out so people can concentrate Dammit ! 
Safe to say it worked pretty well
My dog does this... sometimes with her bone in her mouth, and chews it upside down. WTF
Nice try, but not even a dog can stop me from failing a test. HA! Jokes on you professor!
TEACHER OF THE YEAR AWARD
Humans don’t deserve dogs 
Boy, that horse sure is goofy
I had a professor bring his greyhound to class all the time. It was great 
What exam was the dog taking?
Dog still looks a bit nervous 
Gifs that ended too soon. 
Employee of the year
I wanna take this class
That’s one happy boi
me: *belly rub intensifies*
prof: “um, you should probably go sit down and take the exam now...”
me: “yeah yeah yeah, go grade assignments or something”
 *BELLY RUB TO THE MAX*
Wish teachers at my university did this but everyone is too paranoid about allergies 
[deleted]
That dog is tripping bear balls right now
they tried the same thing when i was in the police academy. the k-9 didn't have quite the same effect.
Business dog doing dog’s business.
My dog would wait a good 20 minutes into the exam, until it was deathly quiet and then let out a massive bark that gives everyone a heart attack.
Aww, what did he do to assist their concentration? Or is that what the wheel barrel of adderal is for?
That dog 🐶 is super coordinated he can move his front paws 🐾 look 👀 around and wag his tail at the same time.He has serious skills what a dog 🐕.
Goodest boy.
For the love of Dog, someone rub that belly!
"That's right, kids. You just have to keep rowing despite the odds against you. It might look bleak but if you stay on course and do the same procedure as I'm doing, you can overcome anything like doggy paddling upside down."
"Squirm!"

Dog begins paddling on its back.

"Good boy~ Good boy~ You squirming like a student? Yes you are~"
Somebody needs to bring in another dog to calm this dog's nerves.
“Ahhhaha this is all bull shit and you’re swimming upstream dummies haha. Just lay on your back and have fun! It’s easy hahaha.”
Looks like the dog's brought along his invisible dog bike.
I want to hug him, and squeeze him and kiss him and love him and rub his belly. Adorable! ❤
That dog looks pretty relaxed and ready for the exam...
Dog is broken please rub tummy to reboot
“You see, this is what you’ll be doing after this exam, you’ll be drowning in tears, like this!!!!!”
Awww

Wait a minute 
And everyone failed out of anxiety for not being able to rub that belly
Looks like the doggo needs his nerves calmed too
I don't know what it's doing, but I want to do it with it.
Excite nerves for those who are allergic ☹️
This would be awful for me. Would pet dog and not take exam. 
Nerves: Calmed 
Test: Failed cus I was looking at the dog the whole time
I had a professor that wanted to bring his puppy to the final, the school got wind and banned it
I don't know how this is supposed to help.  He looks pretty relaxed already.
L*aww* school?
This doesn't help for everyone, loads of people are scared of dogs
Learning how to deal with pressure situations is as important a skill to learn in college as academic material.  
Nerves would be calmed, but would any exam actually be completed?
I have dog allergies, that mean automatic pass?
Yeah... i would get an F, whole exam i would be looking at dog.
Cute and all but Jesus Christ it’s just a test. 
I wonder if it was too much of a distraction during the exam
That’s a big boi
lol i’d fail his class... i would only focus on the dog 
So, basically they all failed the test because they were too focused on the dog and forgot all the information, right? 
Daww, what a goober.
There's no way any of the students are paying attention to the professor during his lecture
Doggo got into dad’s baggies again.  He thinks he’s swimming through a giant golden pool of jell-o in the sky.
At my university around exam weeks, we had a “stress free day” where the uni hires a bunch of animals to come to the uni for everyone to come a pet and cuddle. They do it every year and there are ponies, chicks, rabbits etc
Que crippling fear of dogs.
How bad is your class average that your professor needs a stress therapy dog?
Is it a class of autistic kids or something? 
or to sniff out drugs in the classroom
Eh Professor. I *sneezes* dont thi- *sneezes* i can be he- *sneezes*

Yeah, great idea!
I would fail that test because I could only focus on the doggo. 
Uhgg I wish I could bring my dog with me to teach.  too bad my college is uptight as all get out and would fire me on the spot. 
This would ruin the test for me. I'm allergic to dogs.
"I'm a college professor! Durr durr durr! Look at me, I'm important!"
He’s doing a heckin’ good job too!
That's a great idea!  Lucky students!!!!
Reading comments about, "you know some people are scared of dogs, not everyone likes them!" my automatic thought is, "well then they are obviously lizard people or aliens and should run screaming back to the center of the Earth or outside space." 

As God said when he created dogs, "these are awesome! I'm going to need them all back at some point." 
That's a very trusting pupper
Plot twist: 1x student has crippling Cynophobia
Good boye professor!
Daddy
How do you learn to deal with stress if you're never allowed to be under it? Makes no sense.

Nice dog though.
12/10 goodest of boys who deserves an A+ on all exams 
The first thing that comes to mind with such initiatives is: what about those fear dogs?
College sissies. Part of the problem. Need safe spaces and animals. Stand on line at mcrd San Diego at 17 years old. Then you will truly understand stress.
Big exam? What is the dog getting a rectal exam?? I’d be acting like that if I had to get one as well, and having to sit in front of a business class wouldn’t help calm my nerves either!
I'd just be agitated that I didn't know what was wrong with the dog. 
Berkeley? Pearce? 
Seems very special.
Aspect!
**IT WORKED!!!**
My general chemistry professor used to the day before the exam, after passing our examples from past exams as pop quizzes, ask us to reflect on our performance after we self graded them. He would then and tell us if we didn’t get a 90% or above then we should extrapolate that to a 60% or so on the actual exam. 

Is this kind of like the dog thing or 

Should I have been a business major 
But it’s only February, why are you having big exams already?
My math teacher did this once. About an hour into the test, the dog took the most pungent, perfectly-formed shit I’ve maybe ever seen. Luckily I was almost done with the test, but many people were not. I remember many people gagging from the smell. Good times. 
Smurt boi providing heckin loves
My old neuroscience professor did this with his parrot. It was somewhat less effective
I hope his exam went well
Wow I would die for him
Sorry I would be terrified 
My professor had a guide dog. All it do was wander around, sleep or eat out if the garbage 
That's what I'd say too so I could bring my dog to work.

i hope there aren't any jewish or muslim students, because this dog is hamming it up
Aww. I wish I could bring my dog to work. But he's old and fat and can barely walk :(. I think he's on his last days. 
H
I looked, but I couldn't find it. Does anyone have a guess at what breed of dog this is?
dog or wolf?
Most helpful boy. 
For the love of god, someone PET HER.
So many people's here, where are all the tummie rubs and pats!?!
Well then, the dog looks very relaxed at this exam. It worked!
Professor Buffed, that is
I JUST WANNA CUDDLE IT
That's how you lose the attention of your students
Is this Concordia University?
What uni is this? It looks like mine but i feel like every college classroom looks the same lol
We don't deserve them
Dog's like: I finally have an audience! I'm giving them a fucking show!
Everybody loves a huggable K9
I like the care free spirit of the dog, it's like everyone is tense about the test and he's just like "yeah fk yeah, Im a dog, paw movements, yeah yeah"
That would distract me during a test.
I'm feeling calmer already
Misread big exam to dig exam. Hahaha
Put your damn phone away or I'll take it away!
"Sorry Prof, the dog ate my exam!" *turns to dog and winks* -
*dog winks back* - *Professor looks at the dog* "Oh, you!" - *everybody starts laughing as the camera zooms out* -
*flunked the exam*
What kind of dog is that? 
Well it’s working. I don’t even have an exam and I’m being calmed.
That looks like a swissie! 10/10 best dogs
Not quite r/awwducational but related. 
talk about setting people up to fail
My boss brings his dog everywhere and I love it when he comes into the office. Boss and the dog... Mostly the dog though. I have treats in my desk drawer and he makes a beeline for me. I provide treats and butt scratches (for the dog)
I feel like the dog is trying to say "WHY are there SO MANY PEOPLE here and NOBODY is scritching my belly?!"
That would definitely work for me -- I feel calmer just looking at that good dog.
...swolefessor?
 I took a life, death and dying class it was a very depressing class made people cry but it was the most inspirational class I’ve ever taken. Really helped me understand life and the joys/beauty of it the professor was a priest that brought his dog in to help ease the mood. 

I really recommend everyone takes a class like that if you are in college you really come out learning a lot about life.
Dogs bung looks like a baby wolly mammoth attempting to get upright or maybe doggie is playing with a ghost? /shrug
The ones really nervous are just annoyed now 
He is waving at all the people to come and pet him. 
I fucking love dogs.
Why is that dog's butthole so wide open Professor?
Kids in college needing a dog to calm their nerves, just lol setting em up for failure
im swiiiiiimmmming....... im swimming.. im swimming... im swiiiiimmmmmming.......... im swimming.... im swimming!
Professor woof woof, what is the meaning of life ?
Quizzing code 299430
I’d be too distracted to do well on the exam lol
Aww
There should be an option to have a calming animal in class. Ah, but I'd never get any work done.
I have an Econ exam in an hour and now all I'll be thinking about is this big lovely doggo. Thank you.
How does this calm nerves?
That dog looks pretty calm already. 

Watching horses do this is actually the greatest
Love dogs. I work at a business where people are encouraged to bring their dogs to work. That'd be great except I'm extremely allergic. I hope the prof asked anyone beforehand.
r/titlegore
This is actually so awesome haha
#WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THIS?!
His butthole. Can’t stop looking at it
Every business professor has the same hand gestures i feel like
I swear this is me when I’m sleep lol 
I love when dogs do that xD
I just wanna hug him
Is there a legitimate study about the validity of this? I wonder how well it works!
I could use a big pupper right now to help calm me down with this overwhelming work stress :(
I love dogs. So much. That said, they have no place in a classroom during an examination. I understand the sentiment, but what about people who are scared of dogs? Or allergic? Despite all that, wouldn't it be distracting to some people if there was a dog in the room being cute? 
I remember meeting a dog the same breed as this in the park, it has such a wonderful temperament around other people and dogs. Does anyone know what breed it is?
Why does taking a business class exam calm the dog?

Oh, I see, he's a Burmese Accounts Receivable they get fidgety towards the end of the month...
This is so nice of the professor. 

My calculator died unexpectedly in the middle of my Econ final... my professor said “sucks to suck” 
I think he’s broken 
The cute ness!!!!😘
Professor, your dog ate my exam! 
Looks like the dog is even upset about the exam. 
Kevin Kaiser?
That dog is being professionally cute.
Everyone got a D-, for Dog Penis.
You said we were going to the pool!
I naem is Dog  
i do a derp  
i paw the air  
aHerpajerp  
You're doing great sweetie.
The professor isn’t even phased by what the pup is doing, I’d be rubbing pups belly
The dog is acting out an overdramatized slow death scene.   Just like the students grades I guess.
My calc 2 TA would always put cute animal facts on the projector before exams to help students relax. Super solid guy.
What if you're scared of dogs and didn't study.
cute dog and professor ;)

Video source? 
your business professor is an absolute ride 
What if one of the students fears dogs? 
Psh! What a teacher’s pet! 
Such a good boy!
A Swissy in its natural state
that is just about the funniest thing ever lol

I think it worked..he looks v relaxed.
Was this originally posted in the dogspotting group on fb?
Omg I love dorky puppies 
My dog use to do this with his bones he'd pick it up and hold it up with him paws on his back and it would fall out of his paws smacking him in the face everytime 
cool cool
Pup doesn’t seem too worried about the exam
Professor, your dog ate my test!
I love greater Swiss mountain dogs!
Not sure if it's the 4 Valium I took our this GIf ( or both) but I'm calm as a cucumber.
More importantly the proff is looking like an absolute unit #r/bb
We can see that he is working hard to do his part.

Some good boy has a case of phantom belly tickles.
"This is all you'll amount to if you fail my master's exam"
I wouldn’t be able to focus on anything but that cutie pie!!!
I needed this today, thank you :)
That is the best doggorino I've ever seen, I hope everyone chipped in and gave it some belly rubs.
Can someone please rub his tummy? God damn.
I'd I no not z you have
Someone rub that dog's belly!
That’s the greatest goddamn thing I’ve ever seen in my life 
Is this dog on mushrooms? He's running upside down.
I had an instructor do that at the 8am final. Definitely didn't help my crush on him.
My university brings in therapy dogs to the student center every Friday and every day during exam week. It’s the only way I survive finals. 
WHO'S A GOOD PROFESSOR? YOU ARE! YES YOU ARE!
Good Lord he is helpful 
*conceals peanut butter*
"Professor, the dog ate my exam!"
During finals week at the community college I went to they'd bring in puppies to keep us stress free, they did more but the puppies were always my favorite. 
i think he justs wanna smash
What an attention whoring super cutie!
Very cute! Does anyone know what breed of dog this is? 
 I don’t know what he’s doing, but it’s definitely working.

How could anyone be stressed with him around?
Grade grubbing has gotten out of control
Who's a good boy?
What a big dummy, I love him. The dog's not bad either
Big dog for big exam^nice
he's practicing for his next trip to the beach.
I’m fairly certain it helped.
The professor is a good boy 
Swissy!
Dude its the business college, how hard could this exam be?
As it happens that was usually my stance before exams too. Complete submission and surrender to my fate.
Super distracting dog. 
What a nice professor and way to think outside the box 
i don't have a dog, i love dogs so much but i can't have :(
Wow....please check my challenge
What a goof ball. If I had that dog in class I'd be paying more attention to the dog than my work.
S C H O L A R B O Y E 
Life as a dog would be so great. 
That doge is str8 GOOBIN'
That good boy clearly OD'd on pets and scratches
I bet that helps, I heard these kids come from a .... ruff neighborhood.
My university brings dogs into the library during finals week
Oh my goodness what is that silly boofer doing. 
Haha ...to cute😍😍😍
Dog: "Ok class today I'll teach you how to be a good boy" 
Doggo does a help 
A shrewd business prof would charge for the privilege 
Business. Big exam. That’s funny
Why is the doggo upside down?
Enjoyed watching. I felt myself relaxing
This would have distracted the hell out of me to ensure my failure 
My nerves are pretty calm now
That is 100% typical Bernese/ Great Swiss behavior. They are the derpiest teddy bears on earth
Seems like a great way to distract an entire class
This is stressful af.

Imagine the urge to give bellyrub all lesson 
I tried to do this for finals week at my old job (with a hypoallergenic dog nonetheless) for the counseling center. I got shut down by the director for “liability issues”. It was a Shih Tzu... some schools are so insane with the folks managing policy. (Ended up firing me because my beliefs didn’t mesh well with her management style).
Dude, this made me want to go pet my dogs. 

It looks like an instructor from an old exercise tape.
I never wished to be in an exame class before except from now! I would love to be in that class
What a DERP. LOVE YOU!! 
r/rarepuppers
I'm calmer and I'm not even taking the test.
My nerves are sufficiently calm now 
Love this! reminds me of everytime one of professors would bring in their dog and we'd never finish an entire lecture because everyone's attention would be on the dog. 
Get this goodboy 600cc of belly rubs, STAT
I know I feel better.
Anyone know what kinda doggo this is?
g o o d b o y e. 
Bullshit.  He just wanted to bring his doggo to work.
What a goof.
My shiba did this constantly 
PR did a great job! Found a good boy for the job!
That dog is huge wow
Why does the prof need to calm his nerves? He's not the one writing the exam! XD
I guess I'll get banned for saying snowflake.  
He's helping!!! What a good boy
“Hello everyone, as you know I’m your Professor, Professor Paul.

And this is my assistant for the day, Professor Pawl.”
Last semester my university arranged for students to visit therapy dogs together during the exam-weeks, just to hang out, pet them, and talk together to relieve stress. I didn't go because I just went home to my parent's house and visited my own dog❤️ 
All my dog can do are eat, sleep, and shit. 
My Swissy would bark at everyone that came in.
Barooo! I'm watchin' you...barooo!

When our girl, Stella, did that with her paws it was a COMMAND TO RUB MAH BELLY NOW NOW NOW NOW and was just as adorable as this floofy awesome dog! 
This is so PRECIOUS,  it makes me relaxed just watching with my adult everyday problems!
And he got him high. Really *really* high.
someone rub that poor pups tum-tum! im stressing out right now
How is this suppose to calm me down, makes me even more nervous because I want to pet the dog. 
Is no one gonna rub his belly?! 
Probably in the same building*

Engineering professor has crucified student who didn't make a passing grade. 
My nerves are calmed, good work doggo!
This is one of the greatest things I've seen.

Once you notice the ring around the dogs asshole its all you can see. Stare long enough and it stares back.
What if some of the pupils get nervous when they see dogs?
The gif won't play for me, I wanted to see the cute doggo.
Hello DOGGIE
Me: What does it say about our young people that they can't handle the stress of a classroom testing environment without comfort animals?

Also me: I must give goodboye all the pets!
This was my brain during Macroeconomics final. 
It's a business class, why are they nervous?
My university has an event called "Paws for Finals" every semester where they have a room with 7 or 8 dogs in the library where the students can go wind down, it's great
Having a really hard time today, and now I'm crying because this is perfect.
Professor does not skip chest day
I remember being this high once
Classic digging the imaginary hole in the sky move.
My dog did the same thing for 18 hours straight after eating my San Pedro Cactus Birthday Cake.
Is the dog Australian?
God, I wish my classes were like this...
Professor has hot pecs 
ITT there are two topics and two topics only. 'Oh my god that's horrible what if someone's allergic' and 'oh my god what if someone is Adrain of dogs' ad nauseum. Like seriously, every parent comment. Do people not read comments before saying the same thing 1000 other people said? 
Class dogs and office dogs should be mandatory! I even heard about a dentist who has a dog in his workshop to calm his customers. I could definitely need a sweet dog to pet while Doctor Fancywatch rummages in my mouth 
I love tearchers who care for their students.
Greater Swiss. Love those dogs.
I hope the prof isn't offering last-minute tidbits of advice or instructions, because NO ONE is paying any attention to him... 
Imagine the nerves of the people in that classroom who are terrified of dogs lol
Love this! Wish my school did that.
Cute dog, hot professor
My professor once brought his dog to class and it peed on someone's bag
When dogs get high: "look guys! I'm running on the ceiling! It totally looks like in running on the ceiling!"
My mother is a professor in communication and sales and she brings her old dog to work because he just sits and relaxes whilst uplifting everybodies mood
IM MOWIN THE AIR RAND!
Do you think doggo has his Masters of Bork Administration?
I wish I can be as happy as that dog
Is that a blue tick hound?
A hahahaha hahahaha I love dosg it make me happy ...................................... but I stuck so not happy 
It worked, my nerves are calmed
My favorite thing my college ever did was bring in therapy dogs a couple of days during the weeks of midterms and finals. Sometimes we had massage students who worked on helping students calm down. Lots of fun things like this. 
you know the test is gonna be hard when the professor brings his dog with him to calm the students 
My college does this one day during Christmas and summer exams. The work with the local animal shelter who bring dogs to help stress relief. 
lol @ this chad strutting around his classroom like Stone Cold Steve Austin.
/u/gabbyguppyfish
I would be tio distracted to work on an exam if a dog is in class lol
Business Brofessor*
I didn't know Paul Simon was a business professor.
I sure hope he checked if anyone in his class is scared of dogs
Damn look at that chest 
I remember going to an animal based interaction camp over the summer when I was younger and the lady running it told us that just being in the same room with a dog lowers your blood pressure. Smart professor
Great!!!! For the people that love animals and try to integrate them 
I wish we had this when i went to uni.

professor netanyahu?
[What in the world happened??](https://i.imgur.com/axJb9ZD.jpg)
That professor is jacked out of his mind
Dogs of the Dow class?
Best professor ever.
PILTF (Professor I’d Like To Fuck)
$doge HODLr
Question: why don’t dogs need to wipe their buttholes? Or do they just get poop on the stuff they sit on. 
Oooh that’s a good professor!  
This dog is clearly drunk
What if you're afraid of dogs? 
Geez that thing has a giant asshole 
Makes no sense. Students are graded on a curve. If everybody gets calmer, then the kids who would have gotten A would get A+, and the kids who would have gotten C would get C+, etc... but in the end it doesn't matter because your grade depends on the class average: it is a competition.
Wholesomeness: 100
Nice excuse. Probably had to bring it.
Then he subsequently makes everyone fail because all they can pay attention to is that huge cute distraction.
Now I'd be nervous disapointing him on the exam
He’s doing a great job!
As an engineer, this is how I pictured every single business class that my dumbass roommates skipped but still managed A's. 
Beautiful Swissy
I would be the exact opposite of relaxed.
ELI5 why the dog is doing that?
You can tell it's his dog because he doesn't even flinch at that raw, unadulterated cuteness. Stonefaced
10/10 good boy
What a good boy

Professor's cool too, I guess
How is that calming down anything? I'd hate to have that kind of distraction right before the start of an exam.
Some professors just get very nervous administering exams. No judgement.
Why can’t my professors do this 😒
Upside down dog paddle. 
What a large lad
Aaaaand the students for whom dogs provoke anxiety did what?
Soo adorable!!!
definitely need this for tomorrow.
Dude, every answer i'd give would be dog.

D for dog.
Open answer: stfu and let me pet the fwoof!!
Is that a greater swiss
****
awwwww!!!
Is that a greater Swiss mountain doggo
Very cool
My middle school teacher brought her dog in while we had tests too. Someone brought jerky as a snack during the test. In the dead silence, the dog started to whine and it was the cutest thing.
I would definitely fail the exam with that doggo in the room
That would calm my nerves
I would like your business professor to teach me how to benchpress
He's trying to dig himself out of failing.
That wouldn’t have calmed me, All I would be thinking about is petting that dog. Test ruined. 
The pre-exam stress vibes got to her 
Every time I see these I want to get a dog so bad, but my dog from childhood died recently and I don't think I could take that heartbreak again.
My profesor brings surprise exams to calm our nerves
This is my favorite thing!

Congrads on the 100k upvotes.
Nice prof. Cute dog. 
Professor is a dilf
What school is this? I need to re-enroll into college and take this class, just for the possibility to meet this good boye. 
How nervous can his class be if it's a business exam?
Swissy!
He’s doing his best impression of all the students trying to study for the exam the night before 
How is that not distracting as fuck for not only the students but the professor dealing with students giggling and recording videos. How is this a good idea?
Breed?
oday, we see a lot of dog owners make complaints like “My dog always barks at people!” or “My dog is not playing with me!”. Moreover, we even hear about a dog killing three people or a dog savaging its owner. Many people think that these events occur because of the dogs’ naturally wild behaviours. https://dogtrainingtipssecrets.com/
Notice how we bring dogs to everything that involves some spirt or mental uplifting, you never see that with cats... just saying. 
There is something about dogs especially playful ones that eases your mind, this was a great idea and shows the professor has a genuine care for his students.. unless this dog is a complete nutcase and is running around knocking papers off desks than this professor sucks. 
We really call that being an otter when my person does it. Completely silly every time I see him do it.
My professor last year did the same thing with her Saint Bernard. 
ALERT ALERT
Row, row, row your boat...
No way I could study with that good boye doing his thing. 
Buisness major and big exam doesn’t go in the same sentence. 
Airwalker boi.
I don't even have an exam and my nerves are calmed.  What a cute doggo
Big ole doge
This is amazing, but kind of not fair- I wouldn’t be able to concentrate on the lecture, I’d be too preoccupied watching this giant pup doing the back stroke- doggie paddle on the classroom floor! 
Wait, the professor needs a snuggle dog to relieve his stress? The fuck. 
Im a hamster person, I would be more anxious with this. Triggered.
Is no one going mention that prof is total DILF? 
Aww This carpet. It feels so good


-peter Griffin voice-
Sometimes I don't wash the sheets on my bed for a month or two.
The dog is adorable, the reason he’s there is disturbing. 
Looks like an Entlebucher Sennenhund.

EDIT: lol why the down vote? That's the breed.
The dog trippin on mushrooms, calms the class. What a fucked up 🌍 
Gotta impress Dr. Doggo now
I have two rottweilers and one of them does this for no reason. Probably cause she knows we think she's cute and we'll come over to pet her when she does. The other one has her own thing, she stretches her legs out like [this](https://imgur.com/wtzBgZD) its called a /r/sploot
There’s gotta be that one person who just has an irrational phobia of dogs. 
How insensitive to those w special needs
sad how snowflake kids cant handle exams anymore without emotional support. 
I read business as busy-ness (from being busy) and for a split second thought: what the hell does he do?? Study the effects of being busy??

not a brilliant moment....
