You know, this is really all I need to see today.
I’ve seen this a thousand times but I still keep smiling.
/r/upvotebecausedog
The best six seconds ever
His face is so happy, you made my day
not just the day, the whole week just got better
You know, all you “Repost” people...I’m on Reddit multiple times a day, every day, pretty much without exception. And I’ve been doing that for at least 5 years, likely more, and I’ve never seen this before.

Idk what’s wrong with you, but this dog is cute af so I wouldn’t mind seeing it again once or twice down the road. I have no idea how often you have to visit this site to get bothered by a repost, especially of something so pleasant, but y’all need to chill out.
For anyone asking for a link, this is an [infinite object ](https://infiniteobjects.com/)
Well that's just ridiculously cute!!!
Dog breathing...

Reddit:”omg that smile 😍😍😍🥺”

Heart shattered by total cuteness overload.
dog smile can make anyone's day
TFW Harry Potter moving pictures are real now. What a time to be alive
dogs don’t actually smile though right? that’s not him smiling. that’s just us attributing what we think on what he’s doing. he’s just breathing lol. 

thought i read that somewhere
This reminds me of x-files pug.

His smile is more contagious than covid!:)
He’s not smiling, he’s hot and wants out of that jacket. But that’s ok, it’s cute. He can suffer a little, it’s their job.

What kind of dog is she ?
that looks like some type of jump scare face. still pretty cute nonetheless
What’s that thing in the beginning??
I love his little yellow rain coat.
I love how he turns as you begin to look at the photo as if he is interacting with you. Just like in Harry Potter!

Am i the only one that doesnt understand whats happening? Updoot for doggo but is that like a mirror or a video thing?
Why do people say “dogs don’t smile”?

That is *so* not true. I’ve seen so many dog smiles in my life. 

Exhibit A: This sweet puppo right here
