that dog's singing really speaks to my soul
A real life Snoopy!
My mans slaying it on the keys.
What a cartoonishly wonderful scene. That family must be so happy.
The way his tail and her butt wags even harder each time he hits a note. I love them!
This is the kind of video the internet was made for. That was great.
I wish I was invited to that party
Such a tortured artist, so beautiful
Hey, I recgonize that! It's Buddy Mercury.

 https://youtu.be/39xq5AATMp4
One of my dogs has decided it is past her bedtime and while I loved the video she responded to my listening to it with a huge groan of disgust and dismay.

I told her she sounds like an angry cow mooing and she gave me a look of pure outrage.
Sing us a song, you're the piano man
I like how the little girl actually enjoys the singing..cute little wiggles
Her dance moves are killin me
This is the purest thing I've seen in a while.
thanks i love it
Drunk friends
Awooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
They just need a kitty in the background pushing items off a table to complete the circle
Start a band
Puppers is in key and baby got the rhythm section down!  When are they playing Coachella
Howl at the tune
Aww man, this just made me miss my sweet beagle. RIP Lucy, your howls were annoying at times but I‚Äôd give anything to hear them again.
Where that super-like button at?
Some much pain in the lil guy ü•∫
You ain‚Äôt nuthin but a hound dog üé∂

That's a pianist's soul trapped in a dog's body.
You can‚Äôt make this kind of stuff up!!!
Everybody's ready for a barnyard dance!

Piano? ‚úÖ

It's got everything! It is a party! üéâ
This is the best thing I've ever seen, and I'm old.
That kind of party might just cure my depression ü§°
‚ÄúSing us a song, you're the piano man
Sing us a song tonight
Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
And you've got us feelin' alright‚Äù
Reminds me of the Bluth Family Meetings/party
Looks like Calvin and Hobbes

that dog is kinda close to being on key with his howls.  

  AND OMG THIS IS ADORBS
This is Buddy Mercury. He has a youtube channel!
This should be in netflix.
Toddlers are insanity packaged small. They take all of your energy and mental capacity and leave you feeling exhausted. 

But dang do I miss it sometimes. They‚Äôre full of so much personality
Me and my friends after taking way too many shrooms and thinking we are making the most genius music.
Thats talent

My last 2 brain cells when I have a paper due in 20 minutes
Absolute banger, can't help but sing along

[Sounds like that dog could team up with this one.](https://youtu.be/l6FvyLdNG6Y)
I‚Äôm digging the piano key dog collar lol
.. and I guess that's why they call it the woos...
Hey guys! It's me! Buddy Mercury!!! The singing piano playing dog! I just made a redit! Arooooooo!!!
This is my video. I'm so happy you shared it! We have a mission to make the world happy and also get more animals adopted! We have a website with merchandise (buddymercury dot com)) a pawcentage of the profits goes to help animal rescues!!! Love you all!!! Arooooooo!!! üêïüéπüéôüé∂
My dog used to do this on my toy piano growing up. God, I miss him.
I love the way the dogs tail wags during his performance
Gotta find the right key to howl to!
That dog has talent.
Ok the toddler is cute and all, but that's pretty standard toddler cuteness. The dog is the real amazing thing here. I've never seen a dog do something like this...
When I see dogs playing the piano and howling I like to think they were an amazing piano player in a previous life.
Thank you for this. I'm having a rough go of it these days and this has been one of the few things to make me smile in a while.
I love your life. Also... I just found out how empty mine is. Thank!
If your party isn't this lit, don't bother inviting me.
NGL, that dogs composition was beautiful.
I love that he almost seems to know what he's doing!
Dog literally goes r/aww
Betwooooven
Way off key. Could use some bark lessons.
Dog can really sing the blues. Any clues on what happened?
Nobody sings the blues like a beagle sings the blues...
WHY MUST I FEEL LIKE THAT

WHY MUST I CHASE THE CAT  


NOTHIN BUT A DOG IN MEEEEEEE
He puts the wolf in wolfgang mozart
An original composition...
Not gonna lie, that‚Äôs pretty damn impressive
Please do a tour, I would go to their concert and I hate going to concerts

You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose I'm wagging

'Cause I give you paw, paw, of me

And you give me paw, paw of woof
That's a cute trick. Worth the time to teach him for this video alone.
Love it
Me and the bois on a Saturday
This is so goddamn precious. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Made my day.
This reminds me of that video of a something like a ‚Äòtypical UK bar at 11am‚Äô?
This is me at karaoke night.
Didn't that guy used to play for the Beagles?
I've never wanted to pet a dog more in my entire life
Dog: "Pick it up, bitch; we got 15 more choruses to do."
This just made my shitty day great. Thanks for sharing
I love this so much. Omg
I could watch this for hours
I just put down my beagle on Saturday I miss hearing him howl at the birds. Shes got a best friend for sure :)
I want so much more of this, like hours of it.  I'd watch it on endless loop.
Aw I just noticed the doggo has a keyboard design on his collar. He's definitely got a rep
What a party animal!
u/vredditshare
That dog is more talented than all of the Kardashians put together.
The kid obviously learned her dance moves from the dog's tail wagging.
I‚Äôm tripping and this is amazing.

I only wish my parties were this cool.
I would pay good money to watch that dog play live at Carnegie Hall
This should just be a channel.
It‚Äôs just meeee and the blues
Reminds me of Calvin and Hobbes.
Titles are everything! This one is perfect.
I didn't play with sound on. For some reason I'm imagining the dog singing "Mama oh oh ohooooo" part of Bohemian Rhapsody.
Presenting, Woofgang Amadeus Mozart
His technique's a bit ruff. Great voice though.
That is the fucking best thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
"Sing us a song you're the piano dog."
That dog is a better pianist and singer than I am.
That was the greatest thing I‚Äôve seen in weeks.
Is it just or am I the only one who has noticed that a baby and a dog are the ultimate duo.
I just love this video, it's pure joy and happiness!
This is the best video I‚Äôve seen in quite a while.
Lol when she drops the toy and the dog looks over like "Oh shit you good?"
I've literally been at this party before.   Just more Ouzo and not nearly as adorable.
That kid's music taste is going to be weird as fuck when they grow up
I freaking love his solo twords the end. He speaks to the soul.


AHWHOooo...

AHWHOooo...

AWHOoooo..
Both of them would be a perfect fit for a NPC character animation on a video game. Just a busker band consist of animal and a dancing baby playing music on a side walk.
Bloody dog thinks he's smarter than me just because he plays the piano better...
I didn‚Äôt know how much I needed this
This is totally a scene from a Disney cartoon!!!
This is the best reefer madness reboot yet!
this is the best posting ever!!
In some ways, this is better with the sound off.
Oh my gosh those two are so cute...,   Off in their own little world of magicüëê not a care in the world.., just two good friends having a great and wonderful time.
The band is really coming together
I really needed this lol, I feel like it healed part of my soul
Can I hire this band for my next party
I‚Äôd go to this party.
I give the dog a lot of credit. It‚Äôs not easy to play the piano and sing at the same time!
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all week!
ü§© i love it 

Play it like a jazz set doggy-o...
I would love to know what's going on in dog's heads when they do this. Is it like pushing a bruise that hurts, but also feels good?
It‚Äôs a pawty
I‚Äôd let this dog babysit
u/vredditdownloader
Its all fun and games until the dog starts playing in the middle of the night
It‚Äôs too bad he can only play in the key of Cmaj and A minor
Oh baby you! You got what I neeeeeeed. But you say he's just a friend.  But you say he's just a friend .
Did.......did I just watch a dog play the piano while singing a song? That dog is literally playing the piano and singing a song.
My father is a piano teacher and this dog still plays better than my lazy ass.
#You aint nothin but a hound dog
Is this jazz?
Caption should have read "Party Animals".  Just saying...
Fuckin musicians always partying till the sun comes up.   Get a job hippies

It's been a year since my beagle Ringo died. The howling in this video triggered a lot of positive memories.
Beagle!!! üòÅ

This dogs plays the piano better than I can...
Omg I love dogs!!!!!
Still better than any mumble rap.
Imagine if this is your Saturday morning when you‚Äôre trying to sleep in.
I told you'd only see this in cartoons
Ready for Carnegie Hall!
We just need to give this dog an elaborate costume and he would become the Elton John of dogs.
THAT is how you live your best life right there.
Put this on Spotify instead of the trash
ooooooooooooooooof
Snoopy for real
Real life Disney cartoon scene

I love how he looks up before singing
Piano man, sing me a song
My heart just exploded. Thank you internet!
A beautiful moment. Thank you for capturing this.
This is just wonderful!
This is one of those no one will ever believe
Dog playing the piano and singing? Priceless.
I need this beagle
The Spider-Man 2 pizza delivery song plays in the last four or five seconds.
Is this the Disney live-action remake of  Oliver & Company? You can't convince me that that dog isn't secretly Billy Joel.
This is the entertainment at a bar in bizarro world.
I can see a band forming
‚ÄúI invented the piano key dog collar!!‚Äù
I would pay big money to see them perform in concert! Front row seats and the VIP package!
So good!
This makes me cry
Her dance moves are killing me!
THIS DESERVES MORE GOLD BUT I AM BROKE! that beagle is quite the talented pianist!!
Piano_doggo has entered the chat.

I will probably keep playing this in loop today. And whenever I am down. To remind myself that.. I gotta party hard kid!
I like the ps2 Spiderman pizza theme at the end.
My last two. Motherfuckin. Brain cells.
It was one of the Bluth's better parties..
It's Barch!
So adorable. My Beagle doesn't much howl since we lived in an apartment for a few years. Definitely had to save this video to make me smile.

Look at both of them shaking their tails...
I need to get my dogs a piano.
Best cover of Werewolves of London I've ever heard
My friend's dog does that during the 5th element scene.
I could watch this all day.
This child is goong to grow up thinking dogs can play the piano.

We need to talk about the fact that HE HAS A PIANO COLLAR.

This totally looks like it could be an adult party, except the adults would be smashed out of their skulls, In this clip, there's definitive proof that kids and doggos are as insane as drunk adults
The sad thing is the dog can play and sing better than me, and the kid is a better dancer.
ooOOOoooOo !

Does your dog howl when you personally play the piano? It sounds like your dog is trying to copy the piano key‚Äôs pitch.
Bagel !!!!!! Yes beagle I know shuttup!
She was shredding too hard, her guitar strings broke, and she had to restring on stage. Luckily the pianist covered for her
Now imagine that good boy practicing...at 3 in the morning
As cute as it is when a doggie plays the piano, those doggie paws with those claws are probably bad for the piano.
I like how he loves playing so much he even has a piano collar
The dog's song actually gets pretty haunting.

Its not the sequel to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas that we wanted... But the sequel we needed
I wish I was just hanging out in that house, seems like a fun place lol
This dog is obviously the reincarnation of a famous pianist (possibly blues?). He's confused by the familiarity of the piano, and the crude instruments (paws, dog vocal chords) at his disposal. Tragic really, when you think about it. Don't waste your life being a philandering drunken musician, I suppose!
Everyone is having the most fun!
When a dog knows how to play piano better than you
Ohhhh goodness this is too much for my heart
It‚Äôs like that flashback in Arrested Development when they all got hammered together in Lucille‚Äôs apartment.
Is the dog wearing a piano key collar?

Reminds me of a Bluth party
this is fantastic <3
Wow that is amazing
Love the Spider-Man pizza Easter egg
This makes me wonder, if he was sitting properly, if you could teach a dog to play piano...
This has made me incredibly happy
This. This is why the internet was invented.
I have
The beast and the beautiful!
I love
Ray snarls
The yo-yo ma of piano
A beagle(?) playing Bowowthoven and a little girl dancing along.  Just what I needed
It's an actual snoopy
yea  such a funny moment and all love
Are you sure it‚Äôs even the same party?
My basset hound would do the same thing when I used to play the saxophone.  I couldn‚Äôt tell if I was hurting her ears or if she just wanted to jam along with me.

If anyone's interested to see more videos from this family, look up Buddy Mercury on youtube. They legit have a piano playing singing dog. It's so cute
Why am I hearing the Charlie Brown song when I watch this? Too cute üôÇ
You must sit at the piano and sing a lot.
I'm in love so perfect!
They should form a band.
Thank you for this
You... Got what I neeeeed!!!!!
"And although the intervention didn't work, it turned into one of the Bluth families better parties. "
Meatloafs first gig
That‚Äôs absolutely one of the best things I‚Äôve ever seen in my life.

There is almost nothing more beautiful than a dog's howl.

Hollywood parties don't go this hard.

That dog just casually singing the blues.
What toy is that? She seems to love it!
üéµPlay us a song, you‚Äôre the piano dog üéµ üéµplay us a song, tonightüéµ
Dog is better than me at both piano and singing
Breaking Des Moines register: we did a mandatory background check and the dog had racist tweets 16 years ago...have to cancel this sorry

Not sure what he's singing but he's really putting his heart into it.  Clearly this song is deeply personal to him and means a great deal.
I know what I'm doing for my birthday this year!
I bet whoever taught that dog how to play the piano is regretting it now.
This is real blues. Kenny G eat your heart out
That looks like it was one of the Bluth family's better parties.
Ever thought that's a singer reborn into that dog's body ?  Must've felt horrible being trapped there.
I am going to make one of those videos for my family for when I pass away and I will start by sitting in a chair and I will say ‚ÄúI have something very important to share with you...‚Äù cut to this video
Puppers do love to sing.

I've got one that will deliberately try to get me going so they can all start singing together.

This is why I love Reddit so much.
Truly a talented artist, that dog.
u/vredditshare
I dunno..but the dog's solo was the best part.
Why do dogs do this?
All I could think was some poor lounge singer made a wish to be famous and some cruel genie turned him into a dog that warmed a million hearts on the internet and he‚Äôs desperate for someone to figure it out and free him.
The first 'Dog'star
I'd so buy their album.
it seems great in the video, but I bet the dog hitting the same note on the piano gets pretty old by day 2 lol
Looks like a classic Bluth party.
Dogs better than half the rappers i know
Did this just break the internet
Son of Snoopy
Awwwwwwww
That‚Äôs the most adorable thing I‚Äôve ever seen.

I hope this post wins Reddit! Not just the post, but all the comments that will result. This is absolute happiness and joy in the purest form imaginable. This dog understands that he is the show and he is creating it! The girl knows this is the dog's show and is enjoying it as much as he is! Thank you for the MOST PERFECT and WHOLESOME clip that I have witnessed in my life!

Dogs and babies, this is the epitome of cuteness

I have watched this video, in full, at least 5 times and it's gotten better each time.  I encourage you all to do the same lol
Not teach that dog how to become a pianist
