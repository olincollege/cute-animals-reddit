That dads smile at the end oh my goodness he is proud.
Rolandp90x and JaydenPollard16 on Instagram.

He‚Äôs a professional cheer coach and he‚Äôs been working with her since she was a baby.
All throughout the whole routine she never showed any distress. She genuinely trusted her dad and it shows. Also the way she looks at him at the end, pure admiration. They're both so talented! It must have taken some really hard work and discipline.
Her little wave...
That little wave is the cutes thing I‚Äôve seen all year!
Dudes ripped.
Interested in the lens and focal length
[deleted]
This is the first time I ever aww'd aloud at something on this sub, they both look so happy :')
Title update. Father is an acrobat, she trained hard for this moment.
This is amazing!
Hmmm maybe not inherited his talent genes... 

Maybe more was nurtured from a baby with his hard work, discipline, skills and dedication. 

She has an expert teaching her all those things from birth, and she's learnt it all from him. That's why she talented. Not lucky genes. Hard work and dedication.
I‚Äôd put my money on him being a cheerleader. May have also been an acrobat also, but that‚Äôs 100% a cheerleading stunt sequence. Tosses, spins, transitions, hand on hip during the single leg sequence and clean at the end are all textbook competitive cheer. 

It‚Äôs like watching a baseball player vs a cricket player. They both throw balls and swing bats, but their technique is totally different.

That is Roland pollard and Jayden i think.
That HD video quality though.  Makes most other videos on here look like they were filmed with a potato.
Thank you, there still is something that is not complete and utter bullshit in 2020. Big thanks for bring it to my screen!
They are so talented but I would have a heart attack if I saw my husband doing that with my kids
Those are cheer stunts not acrobatics


Source: was a male cheerleader in highschool and college
If she wants to be a cheerleader in the future she has a real good start!
The smile and wave from that little girl is so cute that my ovaries are tingling, and I'm a 60-year-old man.
That's called practice.
Hehehe her hair fluffing all around while she‚Äôs upside down is so cute
This is Roland Pollard he was a cheerleader and cheer coach for years and is AMAZING!! His daughter will 100% have a full ride to any D1 college if she keeps up the hard work! This is awesome and I love to see it!!!
athletic families be like
This is so cool ! And IMPRESSIVE !
Acrobat? He‚Äôs a cheerleader.
Not an acrobat - competitive cheer!!
He's actually a competitive cheer coach! She's going to be the best flyer by far on a team some day.
An
He is so proud, at the end in his smile. So awesome!
\> His daughter inherited all his talent genes.

No, they trained togheter in a playful way.

That depth of field
r/nextfuckinglevel
Incredible she can do this so young. That's some next fucking level shit.
I don‚Äôt even trust my child to eat cereal without making a mess.
There aren't talent genes but practice.
Went to hs with this guy. Amazing guy, works extremely hard for his family and his daughter is the cutest little girl who loves the challenges he throws her way!!
Acrobat? Those are cheerleader moves.
Just thought it should be added that he‚Äôs a cheerleader, not an acrobat. This is a one man stunt, and pop off, High v, and heel stretch are all cheer tricks she‚Äôs performing. :)
When he dropped her upside down I flinched...
well that was cute as all hell.
A preview of Netflix's Cheer 2
‚ÄúTalent genes‚Äù bro she has been working hard since day 1. Don‚Äôt undermine her hard work with ‚Äútalent‚Äù
My 3 year old fell over today on perfectly flat ground :-/
He can upgrade to Acrobat Reader Pro
Their IG is rolandp90x. They work their butts of while having so much fun! The trust she has in him is so sweet!
üòç heel stretch was adorable üòç
They're doing cheerleading stunts.

When I saw this pose it hit me that this portrayed everything about being a parent.
I love the way he commentates advice to her, that perfect combo of beaming-pride and cautious mentorship. Absolutely melted
This is the kind of stuff I wish my parents pushed me to do from young. Not specifically acrobatics but developing non curricular skills
This is what being a dad really is. Not earning money though that helps but spending time with your kids doing things THEY like. She obviously is enjoying herself and he is too. This is what quality time really is. Most kids love when they get tossed around. My baby sister used to wear me out spining her so she was "flying" or tossing her up in the air or swinging her so hard on the swingset she would start to fall only for the swing to pull her back.
So sweet! But my anxiety was like-
Can we please have some mats down. I was so worried lol  (absolutely incredible tho)
[deleted]
A great watch, though it makes me nervous that they aren't doing it over padding.  The dad is clearly in control and the daughter is well-trained (and has good genes, obviously) but it still makes me nervous because some of those moves depend on a small child not messing up.

Still, cute as hell.
Smart Dad. 

Wife won't let you buy weights because it takes up space? Use your kid as your workout partner.
Happy and healthy father-daughter interaction and bonding? Check.

Great physical activity for health? Check.

Honed talent that will hopefully lead to some sort of cheerleading scholarship and a good education? Check.

This is pure win.

I will NEVER be as cool at that guy.
Straight dude here - That man is fucking hot
‚ÄúOmgerd there is a black man throwing a kid around a park!‚Äù -Karen, to the police.
Don't train your young children as acrobats. 


It pretty much guarantees they'll become orphans and turn to vigilantism in a stupid costume.
I love this post, but I disagree with the title.

The father trained for his entire life and made a profession out of doing what is seen in the video, and he is clearly a wonderful teacher to share his skill and craft with his daughter.

I do not see any talent here, I see the hours of diligent work  behind the scenes to get to the point where they can share the joy in this activity.

Calling someone talented or saying they inherited talent from their parents is ignoring the efforts it takes to get good at a skill, and it demotivates others from trying.

And sorry, this is one of my biggest pet peeves. I was a choir teacher for 8 years and taught so many students that would say they can't sing, or they aren't talented, and they'd try to give up. (I wouldn't let them.) Then after a year of being in the class they'd have a new skill, and would catch up to their peers that had been singing for years.

If you like something, chances are that with enough time, you can get good at it. You don't have to be the best, it's not a competition. If it makes you happy then go for it.

Not everyone who draws professionally is trying to be the next Da Vinci.

Not everyone who sings professionally is trying to be the next Pavarotti.

Not everyone who swims is trying to be the next Michael Phelps.

There's room for everyone to be good at stuff, and to get good at it takes time, not a magical superpower called talent.
This has put one of the biggest smiles on my face this year!
Not gonna lie at first I thought the dad was gonna try single hand-standing on her!!
It's not just talent, it's practice and hard work too.
They are so talented but  my heart stop everytime he flip her in the air.
Just saying: she's also clearly working hard, too! Inherited but also earned! Go, little girl, go!
Greatest days of his life right there.......she will be off to college before he knows it. It goes so fast and thank heaven‚Äôs for moments like these.
Omg this is SO cute!!! What a great dad!
this looks r/nextfuckinglevel
They've been practicing since she was born....but don't tell Mom!!
Am I the only one that absolutely loves these videos?
Nice routine.  Nice camera work also.
I would wouldn‚Äôt call it talent, that takes a lot of hard work for both of them and kind of makes it seem like you are just born that way.
Saying that talent is genetics really removes all the accomplishment talented people had to do to become talented.
That guy looks like hes strong af.
Looks like dad is actually a cheerleader lol
The way this whole thing is framed is beautiful.
Omg, his smile at the end of the video, so sweet! He looks so proud of her!
Why this so clear.. like 8k out something?
I said "hello" when she waved
OMG I want them both.
dawwww! This made my day. Thanks for sharing
Hey son, come over here for a moment, I wanna try something I saw on reddit real quick.
This is the highest quality video I‚Äôve ever seen on Reddit.
Not genes, more of practice and great mentoring.
How could I not upvote this? Impressive and adorable!
I think i pulled something just watching this.
And here I am struggling to teach my kids to pour the cereal before the milk
Cheer!
I'd say training plays a big part here. Talent is a factor but it pales in comparison to work.
That looks cool, but more like cheerleading.
That's hard work and being their for each other more than anything else. You can see the trust they have for each other, and it's adorable.
She‚Äôs already better than my high schools best varsity cheerleader...
That looks like cheering to me, not acrobatics.
Her SMILE! Infectious! ü•∞
Fuck the genetics, anyone with eyes can see those two worked hard to pull that off. Its genuinely impressive. Kiddo is going to absolutely dominate the play structure in kindergarten
That's now how genetic mapping works there Sparky ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Not r/awww.     This is pure r/next fucking level!!
What a shitty title OP, don't undermine their hardwork. All this for karma FFS.
Holy shit I love this so much!!!
Maybe some genetics going on, but that's just hard work, practice, and love.
1st thought = Super cute üòÉthen ...that‚Äôs one hot daddy üòè
Does r/awwmazing exist? I feel like this would belong there if it existed edit: it does
 No she didn't inherit any "talent genes" and no it's not cute if she did.
Not to distract from the impressive acrobatics, but why does this look so green screened? I assume they‚Äôre using a fast lens to record it with a very shallow depth of field, but it just looks so jarring the way it‚Äôs recorded.
My dude is showing some real 5head thinking here. Do you know how much college costs without something like a cheerleading scholarship?
That little dumpling inherited nothing. She practiced a lot!
The quality of the video is awesome
Thats called training not inheriting
r/nextfuckinglevel
She didn‚Äôt inherit it. They‚Äôve been practicing since she was like 18 months
Welp, this is the cutest video ill see all day
Not to say that this isn't impressive but as someone who performs this type of acrobatics it's unbelievable how fast children pick it up. Their body control and strength to weight ratio are through the roof
No such thing as talent. This is hard work.
This makes me smile. What an awesome Dad.
This is both wholesome and an incredible display of talent at the same time. It's nice to see something like that these days!
She is so cute
That spin was so smooth!
I love all of this- but Dad‚Äôs smile at the end is spectacular.
She's pretty good for her age.

Way to go dad!!!!
Whatever they filmed this on made the world look *stunning*.
Was this recorded on an eyeball??
Her smile is infectious!
that is fucking adorable, **and** skillful

both enjoying themselves, fantastic daddy/daughter moment
yes yes, y'all won. what camera you using though?
Mother and father were college cheerleaders. Not acrobats.

His ig is @rolandp90x 

His name is Roland Pollard. Puts some respect on his name.
That camera is nice af
Cheerleading, not acrobatics.
An*... I will be leaving now.
Imagine looking out your window and seeing this happen? It‚Äôs crazy how talented some people are
I couldn‚Äôt even walk across a balance beam at that age.
Adorable
These guys are poised to take over the web.
The wave was the best.
Awesome
Damn, thats a great for bonding.
He‚Äôs a good dad
Now that's a good role model and positive reinforcement, that kids going to grow up to do amazing things because of her dads love for her, thank you for sharing
Acrobat or cheer coach?
Like a male cheerleader?
Those are straight up cheerleading stunts. He has to be a male cheerleader teaching his daughter early.
I can just imagine her joining the high school cheer squad, and the coach thinking about how she'll have to train another rookie, and a week later, the coach is taking notes from her
that looks like cheerleading
I don't like this. It feels like that child is one slip away from paralysis or worse.,. Maybe not but this feels wrong.
The daughter looking up to dad in the end, so beautiful
Inheriting skills through DNA is a real thing. It's been proven. It works in animals as well as humans. A 10th generation blacksmith will be more skilled than a 1st generation blacksmith, just naturally, because it's in their DNA.

Also they have done tests where they run successive generations of mice through a maze. First generation takes 1/2 an hour to complete it. By the 50th generation, the mice instinctively wizz through the maze in seconds on their first try.
I just wished the title said ..‚Äùan acrobat..‚Äù rather than ‚Äúa acrobat‚Äù, it‚Äôs really annoying me. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Lord, was the filmed with an eyeball? This camera is nice.
Damn this picture quality.. which is this camera..?
Needless to say that is like prodigy level of talent.
That guy is a cheerleader.  He might also have been a gymnast at some point, but those stunts are 100% pure cheerleading stunts.
Look at her smile. She‚Äôll be fearless.
That is one sharp lens
You guys Rock
Jesus H that is amazing. Whew.
That's cheerleading and that little mama is a BEAST! It took me until I was 17 to be able to do most of those stunts!!! At 38 I loved watching this! Amazing video!
God I hate the way 99% of people talk about genetics. Y'all sound like weird 19th century social darwinists, people don't have "talent genes".
That is one cool dad. Look at her smile!
That‚Äôs one bad ass dude right there
i never saw a thing more adorable. oh my, that tiny eep when he first spun her. is this earth or they sent us gifs how heaven looks?
This is so cute and wholesome!
Oh my gosh. Duo-ly adorable. Her charm leaps off the screen.
This is more like 
r/holyshitthis6yearoldismoretalentedthenilleverbe
They are freaking adorable together. And talented as hell.
Holy shit she is cute!  Not gonna lie though that made me nervous XD
I'm a questionably straight guy, and I want that guy to be my daddy.
Father is "an" acrobat.
Geez I can't wait to reach this level of fatherhood.
Canadian judge gives a 10.0 with a 2000 supercute bonus.
Happy Family. 

But that headline is BS. 

Daughter works hard & practices (a lot) with Dad to learn acrobatics. 

‚ÄúTalent‚Äù is the result of practice.
I'll never not upvote a father making time for their kids... Something I wish mine did more often
"Animals will always be cuter than humans."

(sees this post)

Okay, there are exceptions.
The caption... inherited his talent genes, is someone going to mention the fact that you can‚Äôt just inherit gymnastic ability?
This is how you EMPOWER children. Look at the confidence of that young kid, simply amazing. Need more parents like this!
This is the best thing I have seen latelyüòç
I don't like it when people call this kind of thing "inherited talent". No, it's not, it's a skill that you get thanks to your hard work. Calling in inherited talent is basically not giving credit for their hard work.
When he drops her head first that's pretty damn dangerous.  No matter how careful or how practiced, mistakes happen sometimes.
Father is a former cheerleader and a current cheer coach:  [source](https://youtu.be/DfP7WvWsShc)


Genes may have a role, but definitely direct access to good coaching has a lot to do with it
Excellent father.  He‚Äôs giving her a great start in life with exercise.   ‚ù§Ô∏è
She'll make a great cheerleader someday!
Calling things a " talent" disrespects the hard work they put in.
What a cute kiddo and talented too
I follow this family on Instagram! They‚Äôre all gymnasts/ acrobats and they do some incredible stuff.
Amazing
Meanwhile, I tripped on a bump in the carpet on the way to bathroom.
One of the best parts is at the very end, she's only looking at Dad for validation. Screw whoever is watching, what did you think, Dad?
Guess where she's heading? I was fortunate enough to be a college cheerleader. Hope she's tough. 

https://youtu.be/kdsioXA9rAQ
She could be an elite cheerleader! Those stunts are great.
Simply amazing, that‚Äôs what love and fatherhood should look like.
I remember in grade 11 you could choose what classes you wanted...you could choose physics, chemestry, or biology for your science course, a couple of different specialized history courses for social studies, etc.
One option for PE was dance. Buddy chose dance and we ridiculed him for it...until the first day of PE. We all went to the gym and he went to the dance room and we saw that he was the only dude in there...he looked back at us with the most smug face i have ever seen in my life.
Also known as practice.
Him when the dad jokes start: "Remember when daddy dropped you as a child?"
Shes gonna be winning gold in 15
Omg she's so happy, too!  This is great
She must be 5-6 years tops...
Definitely cheer, not acrobat. Still highly impressive.
Tbh I hate when people say someone is "born with" or "inherited" talent, because that's not genetic and it takes away from people's hard work. This girl is clearly *extremely talented* out of the training she's done with her dad, NOT because she inherited it
Eating my coco puffs watching this.  Feeling very fit.
Father is an acrobat. His daughter inherited a way to practice the skills from an early age while being encouraged to develop those skills through play as positive reinforcement which encourages more dedication. 

There are no such thing as talent genes.
It‚Äôs not about genes! The father and daughter have worked dam hard to perfect this routine! Don‚Äôt discredit practice, hard work and effort for ‚Äúinherited talent genes‚Äù!
Amazing! I hope she continues to practice. She could be in the olympics when she‚Äôs older.
All fun and game until she lands on her head.
Awesome!
Future gold medalist!
I love them!!!
father-daughter goal.
That‚Äôs awesome!
New emotion learned: distress

So cute.
Looks fun.
How cute! Imagine how she is going to feel watching this 20 years from now. Ah!

Good parenting is the most wholesome thing in the world.
Many thanks!
üò±üòç
Daaaaaaang! Impressed by both of them.
Do it again, daddy!
Get them on America‚Äôs Got Talent and they‚Äôll do really well
Hold my beer.
That smile <3 And the way she looks up at her dad at the end, so precious!
That last bit was the smile of a man that almost dropped his daughter in front of her mom. üòÇüòÇ
What a lucky kid!  As a little kid my friends and I were always making up routines and whatnot, but this child has a dad with the know-how to really maximize her interest.  It's awesome.
This is not *aww*, this is *wow.*
And her mother is having a nervous breakdown whilst recording this
Holy sheet, id probably face plant doing that
Beautiful! What a Dad!
They're perfect
That is absolutely precious! And that little wave was so cute!
Amazing!!!
They both have such great smiles!
that‚Äôs talent and hard work... lots of hard work. she‚Äôs adorable and they‚Äôre both amazing.
Looks like a bodybuilder to me
Daddy daughter stuff makes me want kids so bad
Why does it looks so weird. Like a Green Screen?
This totally made my day
I wish I had similar dedication to accomplish something beautiful like this! Bravo to them!
Smiles for dayyyyyss
I wish my daddy were an acrobat
Made my day
Father is the Acrobat and the daughter is the pdf
I watch these two via TikTok, they are amazing!! Very talented. They must practice for hours a day to achieve the stunts they‚Äôre pulling off.
Part of me is thinking her joints aren‚Äôt developed enough for those stresses, and the other part of me thinks *Damn she‚Äôs good...*
Mum is probably beaming a '10' right back at them at the end. All so cute, but dad's finish and kid-like grin sealed it
That‚Äôs so awesome! üëè
[deleted]
Woah
I love these two!!
She has a stronger core than a lot of adults lol
She inherited his smile, too! This is beautiful!
That smile at the end got me a little teary.
Amazing! Love the quality and depth of field on the video üëå
buff parents have built af babies?
Cheerleader
Holy shit, that is seriously impressive! Great control from her father, and total composure from the little girl. That was legit awesome.
While it‚Äôs a great title, I think societally we often fail to distinguish between ‚Äútalent‚Äù and ‚Äúhard work‚Äù. 

His daughter may have inherited a more athletic predisposition, but what you‚Äôre seeing is the results of a lot of dedication and tutoring by an experienced body and mind. Still a cool post, I don‚Äôt mean to detract from that in any way.
Was very confused until I realized it did not say ‚ÄúFather is a Crobat‚Äù like I initially read
She's going places
What the.........? Bravo!!
That's not talent that's practice and effort.
Oh my word!!!!  This is the best way to wake up!! Too adorable!!!!
Can someone tell me how they got this video with this sort of focus? 60 FPS with a special lense?
Cool
I love this so much. So adorable. Gonna hug my daughter now and see if I can balance her on my hand.
Safe with dad ‚ô•Ô∏è
r/mademesmile
It has little to do with genes, he has probably been training her since she could walk like my old acrobats teacher did with her son. She said it was to make sure his body adapted [to the stretch] before he became too old and that it was fun to have him join her when she stretched. 
I can imagine this father finding joy in teaching his craft to his daughter.
CRYINGGG. THIS IS SO CUTE AND WHOLESOME !!  ü•∫üíñ‚ú®ü•∞
I can‚Äôt even get my kid to go to bed on time
Yeah that's how to bond with your child folks
Wow, this is honestly one of the cutest things I have ever seen.
This made me smile!
My cheeks!  I was smiling so hard that they hurt.  That Dad has invested in his child and you can tell the love.
What did you film this with? The quality is unreal!
Anyone know what type of Nike shorts the dad's wearing?
Why does it look like they're in front of a green screen?
Holy crap! Yeah she did! Those two are amazing together. I can see this duo in the future selling out shows.
I hope me an my daughter have a connection and trust like this when she grows up.
Snap
Grinning like an idiot watching this.  Great way to start the day.
Her little face :)
What a beautiful family.
Beyond awesome!!
Talent is just prusued interest. Skill is practiced. Talent will only take you so far. This is clearly practiced, and good on them.
The practice and all those bonding moments... that‚Äôs the good stuff. This was wonderful to watch ü•∞
I love these two!
Dad of the month.... maybe year
The kid's uncle needs to film this not mom. I want to see the kid get tossed to unbelievable heights and perform acrobatic magic with dad. THIS IS REDDIT, NOT AMATEUR HOUR!!!
Dang, what kind of camera is filming that?
That was bloody amazing!
r/toptalent
That look of pure adoration she gives him at the end. He is her hero! ‚ù§Ô∏è
He's so proud, what a cool dad!
That look and smile back at dad when that finished. Mah heart.
awwwww this little girl has a bright future ahead of her!
This is such a cute video! but side note that background is beautiful!
I never believed male cheerleaders could carry their skills forward into adulthood. Today I'm proven wrong.
In a world going to shit, this is a refreshing break of happiness.
Talent genes, what the fuck. Ye, screw hard work and dedication, "talent genes", Jesus fucking Christ.
Tne smile on his face says it all.
Now I want a daughter....and an athletic body
Sooooo cute.
Amazing!! She'll be bringing in the gold!! I also love the father daughter bonding. So important.
Cute

That‚Äôs the cutest! Great dad!
Looks like Simon Biles has come future competition.
She just loves and trusts her daddy. What a cutie.
You guys are Great!!!! Thank you for sharing
Oh my gosh, that's adorable. She looks super happy.
Love them, love them, love them
I needed this today. Love it!
Thats some impressive camera work too!!
Simon Biles did you shrink?
After the routine is over, hands to the sky for the judges to give them a 10 for a score!
Outstanding
They are just so proud of themselves. I love it.
Talent
Omg this is beautiful.
This is simultaneously the most adorable and most impressive thing I‚Äôve seen all week.
Everything about this is adorable
Amazing

Those smiles!!  Wow. How great.
I am clapping üëè
Sure would be a shame......
Holy crap she's awesome! Also, that's a father who spent a lot of time with his kid.
So wholesome!
I wish I got all the talented genes
These are so cute, I love her trust in her dad
She is going to be a star and at worst she will get a financial ride through college
Her little arms üòç
Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è they've obviously spent a whole lot of time practising this which will make for a deep bond between them
And I got dropped by just being held normally!
Humans can be so fucking beautiful.
I want a daughter so badly ;_;
Lol!
This is so damn cute I can‚Äôt take it.
That was really precious. She looks so happy and proud of herself, as does her father. What a great dad.
Or he has just been throwing her around from day 1 -.-
Me:  <attempts to tie shoes, falls down, spills coffee>

Her:
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôm going to see for a while
I feel a real life ‚ÄúBring it on‚Äù movie coming on..
I love this so much!!
Acrobat by day, Batman and Robin in the night :)
In fucking jeans!
Wow
this is unreal. how do you start attempting this? i could barely get my kid to get all of her food into her mouth and not all over her face at this age. bravo
And whoa the cinematographer?
Okay now she do him!
Where do u even begin to start practicing this and how old is she 4/5?
That made me smile quite a bit
Esam
I usually scroll past a lot of this stuff but this one got me.
That is so cute and so much talent. I like the twirl, so cool.
This is so awesome
: jaw drops :

Incredibly impressive, especially since she appears to be pretty young. And absolutely adorable
Tilt shift much?!
whoa
dad so proud
So cool! Passing on those skills!
How stoked will her high school cheer team be if she decides to join?!
I wish my dad was like that.
She's so proud and she knows she's good! Good for dad for mentoring his daughter
That is so adorable! She‚Äôd make a good cheerleader!
If he wants to try for another baby to add to his troupe I'm right here.
Oh my goodness. Melt my heart üòç
kid just does a pose on his dad‚Äôs hand and is fine while i fell off my bed while hugging my cat
Great focus!

What a stress for her grandmas

So dope!
Well, this was just the most adorable video I've seen in a long while!  She's so talented!
He communicated the whole time. How exhilarating that must be for both of them.
Omg when she raises  her arms I'm like SQUEEEEEE!!!! SO CUTE!
Omg this brought such a big smile to my face!!!
This is the cutest omfg
Just, WOW.
OMG SHE IS SO FREAKING PRECIOUS. Haha, she definitely inherited his talent and infectious smile. Love it
Absolutely Amazing!!!!
At times she looks wiggly as a noodle but he is holding her up none the less. Good trust.
An
Never seen such daughter father video that‚Äôs this cute
Some people are clearly superior to me.
That's so cool... Wish I inherited something from my dad. The only thing I got is a binge eating disorder))0
Amazing! üôåüèª
This is adorable. This 30 second video is all you need to see to know that this girl has a good family and will grow up well.
Sure but talent is often and always .... Practice.   In guessing he practices a crap ton and she's always there so he includes her.  Hence why she is good
You got me. I‚Äôm smiling.
[removed]
Because I wanted you to come to me and say, wow. He is so great and I was gonna say "well it's in the genes." And I was actually going to be wearing jeans.
She‚Äôs going to be a star, and it‚Äôs so sweet to see a dad sharing his passion with his daughter.
When I was her age the best thing I could do was get a strike in wii bowling üòî
woah and so dang cute!
I like it.
Hi
A lot of talent right there.
Loved hearing him coaching her throughout it.  Such a sweet bond!
It looks so photoshopped yet it doesn‚Äôt
That is so cute! Great dad!
And here I am throwing my back out just taking the car seat out of the car. I gotta step my game up.
How cute
Kid‚Äôs a damn gyroscope
OMGosh this is the cutest! The way she looks up at him in the end is so precious
Just don‚Äôt show mom until it‚Äôs perfected
When she lifted her foot I screamed!
So wholesomeness
WOW.
Talwnt isn't inheritance, it's skill. I have the skill of having no friends
Yeah call hard work "talent genes" to justify your lack of discipline
That smile.
Aww, this is great!  Thanks for sharing and giving me a wholesome smile this morning :)
That‚Äôs really cute
Very little of that is talent.

That's the result of hard work and tons of experience being passed down.
O wow, that is so adorable.  How talented both are!
Nice camera
The way she looks at him after it‚Äôs all done ‚ù§Ô∏è
I am so stoked this is the first thing I saw on reddit today. It's gonna be a good day.
This is so wholesome
Oh my god! That‚Äôs so cute!
(Gets home from work) ‚ÄúHoney.....where‚Äôs our child, I wanna try something‚Äù
He‚Äôs obviously super talented, but shit I‚Äôm nervous AF
Should be on r/eyebleach
This is perfection.  Great father, great skill.
*AN. An is used instead of a for all vowels. That includes AEIOU. father is an acrobat
*everyone liked that*
He looks so happy and proud in the end
Amazing display...I wonder how many single moms were throwing their numbers at the guy after lol
And lots of practice...
Love these two!
This is so amazing!
This makes me so happy to seeü•∞
Wholesome goodness
Great way to start my Sunday, thank you!
If it was me I would be screaming my lungs out lool
This is absolutely the cutest thing ever.

They're both super fit!

And she's super adorable!
That‚Äôs so cool
Amazing
Her smile and his smile at the end. I'm done. Internet over.
That‚Äôs super impressive
Can we give some love to the person behind the camera for that awesome camera work?
I see them on Instagram once in a while. Love it. They're so cute together
Goes the show the people being thrown really have little to do with these performances.
Honey, I Broke the Kids.
Lift with your legs!
He‚Äôs a cheerleader and a great one!
This put a huge smile on my face this morning :)
That is a great dad and a proud daughter
Follow them: @rolandp90x and @jaydenpollard16
I love watching this and the perfect twist..wowüëå
Dad is "laser focused" on his daughter and his daughter completely trusts her father.........thanks for the video......made me smile......stay safe!
Spectacular!
She will make the cheerleading squad in high school no problem , when that days comes .
If I tried to do that I would sleep with my eyes open..üòÇ üòÇ
He looks so proud of her!
Love this!
Loved it
Wholesome af
Cool
He smiled like Kobe at the end.
I love this :)
That kid is gong places
First smile in the Morning for me! Lol!
Olympic champion 2028!!
I think he‚Äôs a cheerleader based off his verbal cues to his daughter
Wow that‚Äôs great!
Why am I crying rn
That little girl is braver than me.
‚ÄúAcrobat‚Äù..... looks more like a make cheerleader. Which is still cool. My brother used to do this with my niece all the time when she was young. Anyone who‚Äôs ever been in competition cheer will probably know someone that can do this with little kids.
That depth of field!
omgosh! she's so cuuute! that core strength tho..wowza!
Adorable af
Whoa. This is amazing and makes me nervous all rolled into one. Haha
Have my upvote. That‚Äôs impressive.
Wow amazing!!!
I do that with my 1 month old. My wife hates it.
She also inherited his fearlessness.
Her smile makes it seem like no big deal, so awesome!
She is so proud and he is such a strong foundation!
This looks super green screened
Holy shit that is amazing!
I'm actually amazed! That doesn't happen often.
Warms my heart but that focus from the camera that blurs the background like that just adds to it
1p quality nice
Amazing in every way even the filming.

Does anyone know what camera and setting was used?
This was on Instagram a few days ago (not sure if this exactly, but definitely one of their videos) and sapios couldn't stop themselves from commenting "this is so dangerous" "risky dad" and etc.

‚ô°Nevertheless, this daddy-daughter duo is so heartwarming and inspiring.
What's up with that video quality?
She is definitely going places
The way they pose at the end! üëèüèª

Awesome üëèüèª
Holyü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Wow she is so cute and so good!
That's really cute.

"Talent genes" - sounds like ultimate insult for people who achieved something by hard work.
Boy o boy this made my day  !!!  Nice Nice
Whaaat? That's insane!
[My daughter and I need to step up our game.](https://imgur.com/a/h5td1Gm)  


I wish this guy would put some tutorials up on Youtube. I'd love to learn how to do these moves.
Awesome
Seeing crazy talented kids like this always makes me wish I could see into the future. Did they use the talent and become a huge success or did they get sick of it in high school and started smoking weed and spending their time trying to get laid?
Does my heart good to see that.  She is adoreable beyond comprehension.
oh god
Smile of a Winner right there.
You‚Äôd know they‚Äôre related from that gorgeous smile!
Awww they are soooo cute!! She's like a cute bundle of joy!!
When the kid is more fit and athletic than you üò≠
"were you dropped on your head as a child ? "  .....well, yeah
This is the thing, dad *is* going to catch you.
My wife is not allowed to see this...
Like a young version of Spencer and Barbara
When you know that you're going to have more good times together
I don‚Äôt have a kid, but I don‚Äôt think I could be yeeting one around if I did.
Kala bander parivaar
What a pair of dolls.
Why does the videos look like this? I get having the two people in focus but damn. It‚Äôs just too much blur for me
This is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen in awhile
This is just too adorable. It's giving me heart palpitations and sweaty eyeballs.
Thanks guys, my wholesomeometer just exploded, do you know how long it took to build!!
Love it!
An*
Pretty sure I know that guy from high school. He was dope back then too
Love it!
How do you even practise something like that? Lots of crash mats?
God damn, I'm so jealous, that is so cool..
Where the fuck are those genes in my family, I can barely touch my toes let alone all that.......
Great now I have Elton John playing in my head.
It‚Äôs that chemistry
this made me emotional
She's going to make a great psychonaut.
Damn cute.
It's an acrobat*
Dang what a handsome man.
That was sick.
Made my day
inherited that work ethic
Aww!
Trust
That could've ended as a piledrive.
That girl is more talented Han I've ever hoped to be.
Love it
Why am i crying at this??
That's so cute it warms my heart!
I inherited corporate skills from my Dad üòÇüòÇ
Kids are just naturally good at that stuff...
Damn we have a future World Champion
Beautiful!
I needed this
Everyone likes that
Now reverse roles.
Ahem, this here folks is what we call *Black Excellence*
 I know them. She is actually 13, and he is 7'5 so she only looks like a kid next to him. He's actually 65, and are blessed by great genes.
Man, that guy's body....I want that.
That‚Äôs a nice camera!
r/praisethecameraman
Acrobat isn‚Äôt the right word - he was a competition cheerleader and gymnast!  My daughter‚Äôs coach could do this with his four year old daughter too!  Amazing skills!
That is truly amazing! What a great team!
I want a daughter, but god damniti can't even take care of myself
Genes? Uh, no! Practice makes perfect
This is wonderful.  Like such a wholesome thing that I'm crying a bit.  This is awesome.
Damn... When I have kids, they're going to be really good in the gulag, and uh...
This just makes me smile.
Great job little one.
I love all the bonding time and their smiles. Good for them
This belongs to r/nextfuckinglevel
That 720 toss up to standing on his arms..... holy shit. I'm just trying to compute in my brain how fucking hard that would be.. I have a hard enough time just stomping a 360 on a trampoline LOL.
She‚Äôs going to be an amazing cheerleader when she grows up!
Wow !!!! Unbelievable!!!
This made my day.
This is perfect ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
["Talent"](https://m.tapas.io/episode/923459)
Acrobat, or cheerleader?
That‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen!
This is adorable üòç
So exciting! So darling! What a fun dad and the sweetest daughter!
There is most certainly a buttload of hard work involved, ‚Äútalent genes‚Äù sounds a bit like downplay. Very cute video though!
Beautiful
My heart. Real men lift their kids up and elevate them.
Republicans salty right now.
OP is not "an" english teacher

Lies you can see the wire crew in the background
I hate it when people discredit all your hard work on "genes" and other bullshit.
That is adorable.
Wow that was awesome!
cute, but everybody knows this is chroma right
Wow!!!
Dude looks like if Drake got ripped
Father was a cheerleader.
Acquired characteristics are not inherited
Furz hallo
This is honestly pretty stupid and dangerous.
At the end ‚ÄúMan my dad is awesome‚Äù
As a stay at home dad to a 15 month old, it warms my heart to see dads and their children.  Its rare here in the US. Drugs have almost completely destroyed generations of families.
Excellent videography
Less about genes and more about training from dad.
I love this for so many reasons. Obviously this little girl is ficking talented and a boss at what she does but not only is she amazing at it she also absolutely loves it and seems to get a great deal of satisfaction out of making her dad proud - which he clearly is! So cute!!!
Great video, love it!

FYI: there's no such thing as talent genes. Youcan do this stuff too through practice! Don't let ypurself get discouraged by someone telling you that yoj don't have "talent". Some people are just quicker to adapt certain skills in specific areas than others, but that's mostly due to previous knowledge or better learning technique!
At 0:08 something falls out of her pocket. She‚Äôs gonna be looking for that.
I ***KNEW IT***


GENES . ARE . EVERYTHING
I couldn't have imagined a better way to start my day on Reddit. It's all downhill from here, boys.
That‚Äôs straight up cheerleading moves
I can't do that even on floor
Nice
That‚Äôs cheer
The father smile at the end is so genuinely uplifting! I'm going to get out of bed and go adult now.
This is really cute. Father daughter bonding time.
