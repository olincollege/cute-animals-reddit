Locked due to excessive Rule 4 violations. Does it matter that much whether it's a painting or a portrait?
Ok, wait. How TF do you paint things blurry to mimic a photograph?!?!?
Wow. I zoomed in to try to find brush strokes and ultimately failed. This is Amazing. 
paint me like one of your good boys 
This is a painting?! Christ that's some insane talent bud. 
Very nice touch including the photographer in the reflection of the eyes.
I thought that was a photo o.O 
If you can't tell that it's a painting just zoom in and you'll see that you still can't tell it's a painting. 
Wow, Even my camera can't take such crispy beautiful picture. My phone says thank you for the wallpaper! :) GREAT WORK!
I’m sorry did you just say “painted”?
I clicked expecting a painted dog.  What I got was a painted canvas.  Stop with your lies.
Great job! What media? 

Edit: a word
How long has it taken for you to be able to paint like this?
Found your site.  Amazing work. I shed a tear when I saw the Westie. We had to put ours down a couple years ago just before his 15th birthday. 
That is not a painting. I literally dont believe that is a painting.

Show me proof or I'll.... not believe its real which is totally gonna cause some sort of problem lol
I found your web site and sat open mouthed looking at your work. 

Can you post a pic on here where ut shows actual canvas and some background, cant believe this is a painting...
This is a fucking painting?? HOLY COW! Can you please paint a 4K version of Mona Lisa? 
It's crazy to me that so many people are doubting you OP. Hyperrealism is an established art movement. Congrats on having not only the talent and skill but the patience to paint like this. It hurts my back to even think about it!!! Has anyone asked yet how long it takes for you to paint something like this? Would love to know. 

Also you are DEFINITELY not charging enough for your commissions. 
I'm unconvinced this is a painting.
How is this a painting? How? What? Where? When? Sometimes why? 
>painted

Wait, what?
[deleted]
what color was the dog before you painted it?
This looks like a photo of a dog with a photoshop filter on it to look like a painting. 
Incredible work of a very good boy!
How come paintings from 100 years and older don't look like this?  Is there new techniques?
Really tho, is there any way to prove that this is a painting... my brain can't handle this 
I'm still not convinced that this is a painting.
Nice photo, but where is the painting?
it was fun going through your post history and just counting the gold 
Dog gamn!
Man, that's amazing!! I had a Lab that was the best thing that I had in my life. He was the most amazing, friendliest, and most personable dog ever. People that met him that also had a dog wished that he was their dog, and I am not exaggerating.

I had him for 11 years. He was born the day after my daughter was born and she grew up calling him her brother. I had to put him down a couple of months ago and I have been heartbroken since. My kids are still torn over it. I would like to ask you if you could do the same for my Duke.

*painted*
Have you got any progress photos of this painting? I'm having a hard time believing this is a painting. 
[deleted]
Beautiful 
Thought it was an actual photo
I commissioned the wrong artist to paint my dogs. 
You sure that's not a real dog, bruh? 
That's painting???
Damn, thought it was a legitimate picture of a dog...
How is this a painting 😱 I zoomed in but could hardly see brush strokes! This is amazing, seriously. Well done! 
How long did it take to do?
WTH, that looks like a photo, or an ever so slightly blurred photoshopped photo.

If thats really from scratch  painting, you have mad skills.
the way the eyes and tongue are done is unbelievable 
OP is lying. This is clearly the work of a magician 
Nice work! What color was it before you painted it?
Only thing I can differentiate is the bottom lip and tongue, everything else looks 150% lifelike.
Yes it’s amazing that a painter can do this what is even mote amazing is that paint itself is able to replicate imagines to almost perfect picture quality.
Curious as to what medium you used? It looks so crisp, like a digital painting. It's absolutely beautiful. 
The talent is clearly amazing, but I have to ask, if you paint something so photorealistic, what's the point?  

It becomes a nice novelty, and it's technically astounding, but... ultimately it just looks like a snapshot I could take with my phone.  

All due respect.  What you can do is incredible and you should feel proud as fuck.
Anyone else a little skeptical that this isn’t just a picture?
What color was the dog before you painted it?
You know you can't just take a picture of something and say you painted it right? Amazing job.
Is that a digitally re-smudged photograph? Edit: Progress pic looks superimposed.
In the future do you think you could post a time lapse of you painting? I think it’d be incredible to watch and it would clear any doubts people have that this is actually a painting. Thanks!
Found the brush stroke 

Bottom left corner his signature 
I don't believe you
Don't you mean you took a picture of a dog?
I guess he decided to paint the reflection of the cameraman in the dog's eyes too.
I cannot process that this is a painting and not a photo. If this is truly a painting, please message me, OP. I will happily pay for your services. That would be incredible. 
I mean I don't wanna be an asshole but that looks like a photo with a filter
You and I have a different definition of painting
I see here that you posted the picture, that you used to create your painting.  Would you mind sharing the actual painting?
No fucking way this is a painting... 
How did you get the focus effect?


Amazing!!!
Damn that is amazing. I involuntarily zoomed in to the eyes first and was blown away by the amount of detail you put in there. The whole painting actually. How long did it take for you to finish it?
This is a picture. YOU CANT FOOL ME!

Seriously though, damn fine talent.
I can't even draw a straight line with a ruler. You've got some insane talent.
Painted, you say?
Paint?? Whoa!
Wow...this is incredible.  I just thought this was a photo, I'm blown away!
WHAT THE HECK??? THIS LOOKS SO MUCH LIKE A PICTURE! YOU ARE AN AMAZING ARTIST!
This is incredible.
I love how you painted in a little eye booger. It's the little details that count.
If this really is your painting, then you need to know I was flabergasted. Still looking at it in wonder..
This looks like a real dog. Great job!
That painting looks more real than my dog tbh
How did you get the paint off the dog?
You took a picture of a Redditors dog*.
Seriously though, this is amazing.
Wow! That's amazing! The only way I could only tell it was a painting was the out of focus parts looking a bit painted when I zoomed in but there is no way I would've been able to tell if I didn't know beforehand. Keep it up OP and post more!
What color was the dog before?
That's amazing!
This is absolutely beautiful. You are so talented!!  
Dude i can even make out the photographer in its eyes. you are insanely good.
Down to the focus/blur and the shine in the eyes/tongue. This is some of the best work I have seen.
Amazing as always, I love when I see a new post from you. Just incredible work and talent, I hope to one day have you paint my boy (okay he's a dog, but also my kid). Thanks for sharing your work.
This is gorgeous! I loved seeing all of your other paintings that you have posted as well. It's fun to watch the progression of your work throughout the different pieces! 
Crazy how people keep trying to say that it's fake-like they can't comprehend somebody being this talented. 
Well done, and please keep painting! :)
I wish I could upvote twice because this is amazingly good
I thought you said you painted this? /s

Lol, this is amazing!!
Calling it now Witchcraft! I can't even paint a flat fucking wall, and this peep paints a dog? 

Well done sir!
What color was he originally?
[deleted]
I ~~painted~~ *took a picture of* a dog...
-ftfy
/s
Seriously *amazing* talent. Thanks for sharing!
My god this is unreal, the reflection in the eye looks like a person sitting in a chair by a window. The only thing that seems just slightly off for me is the nose seems a little out of focus, like a sharp focus would show those little round nodes that are on a dogs nose.
That's cruel. Was it water based paint at least? 
Wow, I love seeing the amazing things that humans are capable of doing 
Its so good that I thought this was one of those posts where people take a picture and run it through some shitty filter and claim they painted it. props
I think you’re brilliant. Can I have your website details and do you ship to the U.K? 
Plot twist: By "painted a dog" you mean you painted that dog's otherwise blond coat then took a picture of it.

Seriously though well done that is great art!
You mean you took a pic of a dog? Cause I refuse to believe otherwise 
Do you mean you took a picture of a dog? I didn't even know paintings could get THIS realistic.
You have so much fucking talent, I want to cry.
You realize taking a picture of something is not painting it? Smh some people 
Where's the painting? This is a photo.
What colour was the dog before?
How does one locate your brush strokes
This is a picture right???
Impressive photorealism, awesome job. I can't really discern this from a real HD photograph of a dog. 
I hope you asked his permission first before you started painting on him.
Even the reflection of what the dig is looking at is in his eyes! Amazing! 
What part of the dog is painted?
This is absurdly realistic, dude, damn... 
Erm do you do nude requests, I’ve always thought I’d look stunning on canvas.
This dog looks more like a real dog than my real dog
Viarge!!  Magnifique!
What color was the dog before you painted it?
I would love for you to paint my ferret 
How did you get him to sit still long enough to paint him?
I call bullshit this is a picture
No way that's a painting. Jesus. You're amazing.
I don't believe you. But if I'm wrong and this is indeed a painting then take my skepticism as a compliment.
That’s a photograph.
I’ve had a few drinks but *fuck* that’s amazing 
Lovely
Well the signature looks like from a painting, the painting doesnt look like a painting though
What did you paint this with, a printer?   
Damn dude...
Well if you are drawing it this good you might as well take a HD picture and Photoshop a signature to it. That's what I'll be doing from now on anyways. 
This is the best photorealism painting I've ever seen. I still don't fully buy is not a photo.
Post the link to your website fuck, you deserve all to money you can get
You know out of all the reposts and shitty memes this site does amaze from time to time. Great work and like others said its hard to tell the difference from painting and photo.
How did you get the dog to stay still as you painted it?

What was the original color?
did you just use the smudge tool on a photogtaph or was this actually painted? no offence intended just curious
No way that’s a painting!!!
This is painted?? Whaaaat
Do you do any sci-fi or superhero type paintings? 
That’s not a painting don’t try and lie to the internet
starting to think people just put images and claim it’s a painting for karma lol
No. I refuse to believe this.
This is tremendous, man. Keep up the good work.
[deleted]
Incredible.  Where/how did you learn to paint?

I'm seriously impressed by the photorealism you have here.
At what point does a painting become pointless? This looks like a photo, so why not have a photo of the dog? I know that sounds harsh, and I in no one deny the incredible ability of /u/Hara-Kiri - but is it weird to make a basically flawless copy of a photo with a painting? Just a thought....
**STOP LYING TO US THAT’S NOT A PAINTING**
There aren't enough superlatives for how good that is.  I'll just go with 'astonishing' and you can insert any others you want.
What did the dog look like before you painted it?
Is that a painting?
This is so beautiful. You are amazingky talented!
Ok so this is clearly the photograph - where is the painting?

Joking - this is fucking incredible. Photorealistic to some next level incredibleness that's for sure.
Nice picture. So where's this painting you were talking about?
I don't understand how some people are so good at art. I am quite academic but I would trade it to be able to paint like this.

That is absolutely amazing. Would love a pm to check out the site and maybe looking into getting something done of my own. 
w o w ....

You mean you photographed a dog... right.?
There is no way that's a painting that is way too perfect

You’re a great photographer.

EDIT: Oh. My. God.
Can we see some progress shots? I have a hard time even comprehending how this is a painting!
I literally cannot imagine having this level of talent
You misspelled 'took a picture' 
Nice try but this is very clearly a ^photograph ^^of ^^^a ^^^^pup
i thought you literally painted a dog's coat, that's how good this is.

 OP My beloved Dog Victor passed away this Summer after 10 yeaes. If you want it would be super cool if you could paint him :) dm me if you want a pic
Holy shit this is incredible! it looks like a photo, well done OP!
Would love to hire you.
Just showed this to my husband and told him it was a painted and he insisted I was messing with him, hahaa.


You’re very talented!
You are one of my favourite redditors
So this is a picture of the dog you painted, let's see the painting.
This is amazing. Take my upvote 
What camera did you use to take this picture?
Pretty sure this is called a picture haha
For all those wondering how this is done, he/she almost certainly painted this digitally over a photograph. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong op but to do this freehand would result in OP being world famous (hell many famous hyperrealists still paint over a reference).

I hate to judge but the wow factor is a lot less knowing that imo even if I still couldn't do this with the same tools.
Amazing...
Amazing!
i want to see a dog that got painted,  like maybe a blue or pink or green dog.  
Do you have a website or something I kinda want one
This is a painting? Wow
Checkmate, Picasso
Majestic.  
Whoa. This is amazing.
Could I commission you to paint a dog painting for my dad? He is obsessed with his dog and this would probably make him cry from joy as a Christmas gift. 
How much? My fiancé would love one of ours. 
This is absolutely incredible. Absolutely gobsmacked that this is a painting. Insane work! Well done! 
Wow! This is incredible! I'd love to have one of my German Shep! Please pm you website. 

Also, my family builds custom designed websites and has worked with artists in the past. I'd love to give you their information if you're looking for a new company.

Very serious about the painting though! 
I don't want to believe this is a painting. That's amazing
Dude, that's goddamn amazing. How long did it take, if you don't mind me asking?
Do you only do animals? Would you consider commissioning one of a human?
I thought that was a picture 
Bro. You always just randomly pop up with your work on sites I go on. Gg.
I upvoted thinking it was an ordinary r/aww at first and then I read the title...
I love you 
Incredible work. What is reflected in the dog's eyes?
You sir are insane
Looks real!  Very nice 
Let me pay you to paint my pups!
This is a PAINTING?! wow!
No way! That’s beautiful. 
This is really impressive.
Incredible! 
This is AMAZING.
That's a painting? OMG it's AMAZING! It's Beautiful! 
Serious talent.  Very nice work.
Wow, I really blown away that it's a painting!
This is fantastic!  You are so talented.  
This is amazingly realistic. Props!
Wow! What type of paint did you use? 
The tonge got me. It looks so real!
Very good detail in this painting.  You make this piece pop. 
My first thought: awwwww cute puppy. 

After reading title: that was a painting. Woah
That’s not a painting. It can’t be...right?
What. The. F***. This is just incredible. It looks more like an actual photo than a painting. Nice job!
What color was the dog before you painted it?
How in the actual hell...
i think you may have forgotten to add the second image to this album, it's only showing the reference photo.  

seriously though, this is really impressive. i like the depth of field effect.
Do you do paintings of people? How about two halves of two pictures and make it into one? If yes, please send me the link. If no, please still send me the link. 

Thanks
do you have any progress pics?
Very nice. 
Please don't put paint on dogs.
Amazing!  Photo quality.  Nice work.  
How long did this take you? Looks amazing
Wow. I can hardly believe this is a painting. 
I love dogs..and this put a smile on my face. You have a gift!! Do you have an Etsy shop/instagram/website where we can see more of your work?
That’s a painting?!
What colour was the dog before you painted it?... I’m sorry, what I mean is this is incredible talent!! 
Absolutely amazing! It looks like a photograph
I'v just been going through your post history, god damn your oil ability is incredible!!
Shut up and take my money!!! 
Brilliant!
This is actually the before picture of him dumping paint onto a real dog
Consider it enjoyed
Duuuuuude.  That is amazing. Mind boggling, even. 
It amazes me that there are people with this kind of talent. 
Could it be that you are a camera!? Wtf dude how!?
This is a photo.  I refuse to believe otherwise.


Nice work...
Jeez, it's accurate even down to the tiny white flecks on the bridge of the nose, and that single white hair on the right side lower eyelid.
Dude, totally thought this was a picture!! Great job!
http://www.tzr.io/yarn-clip/9e27d711-b295-4fb4-89f2-2bcee07b6288
Serious question: How come there don't seem to be photorealistic paintings like this in antiquity? It it because of refined technology, methods, etc.? Does using a photo make photorealism more practical?
This Shea?
This is incredible. The out of focus nose, the reflection from the eyes.... Hope you got paid for this
The digital noise in the low-light area under the chin is especially impressive.
That's not a *painting.* It's a dog!
hey what?
painting? holy shit
Gorgeous job!!
Wait is this a painting?
if life were like a rpg and being an artist a kind of subclass


artist level: 937


holyshit dude "aww" elements aside it is a impressive job
Not a major art buff, but I do remember the first photorealistic painting I've ever seen ("John" by Chuck Close, a huge ~8'x7.5' painting displayed at the Broad in L.A.)

Seeing the amount of resolution, detail, focus, lighting put into every square inch of canvas was incredible. I'd love to see what this looks like in person, it looks outstanding here.
Your link please? Your painting is awesome!
Is this a painting or did you put paint on a dog?
wow amazing!!!!
I... wasn't sure if it was a painting of a dog or if you had painted one dog to look like another dog XD

Amazing.
Googling that name on the corner brings up your page
Can i get a painting of a welsh corgi? :D
How did you learn to paint like this? 
You are seriously talented 
r/blackmagicfuckery
It looks so 3D! The way the top of the nose is slightly faded is amazing. And the eyeball looks glossy just like my dog lol
Is this done digital or canvas? 
Holy mother of paint gods, this is awesome and beautiful, I thought this was just another /r/aww photo but it’s not. What amazingly great work. If I could give you a gold I would! 

And yes as the title says I really did enjoy looking at this thanks man
You mean that's not a photo????
Fucking brilliant, you are. 
By "paint" do you mean, "I took a picture of" ? Because holy shit. Nicely done. 
Yeah my phone is too shitty for me to appreciate this.
I have a hard time believing this is a painting, awesome work! 
@OP could you get me a link to your website? Thanks!
Can you do human? kindly pm me your site if yes. thanks
lmao this is a photograph.
Wtf, literally blowing my mind right now.  It's hard to process the fact that the image is paint.
This is just amazing! It really looks like a professional photo. Sir, u are talented
Reminds me of Clint jammers work
Painting my fucking ass, Jesus christ man. This is insane
Uhm. Do you take requests? 
Wow this is amazing. I would love for you to paint my dog. How much do you charge?
Is this really a painting? That's some real talent.
this made me say, "aww".
Do you take requests? 
Sooo where can I order one? 
Amazing work! I think i found your website and oh dear, those boats! You are really talented
How long do these paintings usually take you?
That's amazing!
The way exactly the right parts are “in focus” like the whiskers helps with the amazing photorealistic effect. Awesome
Sorry if this has already been asked, but is this digital or traditional painting?
This is so good that I have a hard time believing it. damn this is good.
I thought you meant painted on the dog. I was looking for the before and after. Wow. You've got talent!
It looks exactly like a photograph
I had to go to the comments to figure out that this was the painting and not a photograph... very impressive!!
How did you get him to stand still? 
That's awesome:o
What color was the dog originally?



Jokes aside. Cool stuff. 
Waww, at first glance without reading the caption I thought it was a photo. Absolutely fantastic. You have an amazing talent. ❤️ It xx
clarity boi
I refuse to believe a painting can look this real! Great work!
I AM FUNDAMENTALLY AGAINST THE USE OF PAINT ON ANIMALS. ThiS iS HorRiBle. 
Okay I’m still not convinced this is a painting. It’s that good. Good job!!
Great picture.
Good boye
Geez, why don't you take a picture? It'll last longer... (beautiful work, OP!)
How long did this take you?! Incredible work!!!
There's no fucking way that's a painting. That's literally insane. How many hours did this take????!?!??
This is incredible 
Did you wash him after?
Wow, this is a painting? It for sure looks like a photo!
Holy Christ, this is amazing. I was fully prepared to call bullshit; then I went through your post history and saw the progression of your talent. I am in awe of your skill! I'll be dropping you a line to see about commissioning a piece of my lady dog.
Please send me a link to your site! Your work is wonderful! 

How big is this painting?
“Painted” nah fam. I’m convinced this is a picture you took.
what the hell 
I honestly cannot believe it's a painting.
Holy shit this is really, really good. I can't tell the difference between this and a real IRL photo, this is some immense talent good job.
Yeah its amazing look natural
Sorcerer 
Wow just wow 
Amazing!
My initial reaction was "wheres the painting?"
Pics of you making it or it didn't happen. It just looks too much like an actual photo.
Good dog.
Wow, amazing, i can't even know if it's true or a pain, 🖒
I almost don't believe you.

That's amazing!
Other people say you have talent. I say that you Sir, are a witch. Your talents are sorcery level. No human should be able to achieve this. pitchforks everyone.
Don't bamboozle me, OP, you took a picture of the dog
This is amazing. Makes me want to go home, take a picture of my dog, and have it painted because well. . . I like my dog and your paintings are amazing so it'd be pretty damn cool. I look forward to seeing more of your work in the future!
Well I am gobsmacked!

I took a look and doubted you at first, I even zoomed into the image.

Then I read the comments looking for people sharpening their pitchforks and there were none.

Then I found your website, I can tell that most of them were painted, but this one is crazy.
cool
In the most respectful way possible, Bullshit.
I'm pretty sure you just made a fancy PS filter.
"Why do you have a photo of your dog on the wall"
I think you painted a canvas to look like a dog, rather than painting an actual dog.
You are really, really good at painting. I’m sure it’s a mixture of talent and incredible dedication. Well done. 
OP thinks he's funny posting a photo and saying it's a painting. 

/s
There is no paint on that dog!!
Ooo cute! So this dog is the model for your painting? .....wait....this *is* the painting
Very awesome!
Incredible
No way wtf 
Where is the best place to contact you for portraits?
Insanely amazing!
Wow, I can't believe this is painted. I wish I could be half as good as you are!! So freaking amazing.
you paint things better than i see them
love it
The reflection in the eyes are amazing
Amazing !
Great. Now show us the painting.
Fake. This is a photo! /s

Super awesome work!!
....reminds me of my aussie growin up. Amazing painting. 
Holy moly.  Amazing work.
Paint...?
I love this. Could I commission you to paint my rabbits?
this...is a painting?...thats a good fuck painting! i hope your work is on display, i can literally feel it's fluff
Is this really painted??
I honestly don't believe this is a painting.
Sorry OP, but I can't believe this is real. Do you have any pictures of it that you could show us? Maybe it from different angles.
Amazing work beautiful 
This looks like a photograph altered in photoshop. If you look in the dog's eyes you see what appears to be the reflection of the person taking the picture. I'm 99% sure it's a digitally altered photograph printed on textured paper. 
OP, are you sure that you didn't mix up the picture you used and your painting? This is fantastic.
While I and the rest of the world are looking for at least one brushstroke I do wonder, apart from the work and talent out into it, what makes a painting better than a photography?
And, yeah. Fucking hell man, good work!
Amazing work! Is there an actual way to prove something is a painting vs an actual photograph?? I can’t tell the difference!! (Generally speaking, I’m not saying this isn’t a painting)
How TF..
My goodness this is absolutely stunning! What a talent you have. Thank you for sharing!
I don’t believe this is a painting. I would have to see the video of it being painted, and I still might not believe it even then.
I hope you don't work a day job because you are definitely 100% good enough to do this for a living 
Ha! I knew it was a woman painter!
That's insane.
It looks so real!
This can’t be a painting.
Do you always blur the body fur?
Did you paint this with a camera?
This can't be a painting... Did you actually paint the dude reflected in the dog's left eye taking the picture of the dog? 
You can tell by the blur but goddang thats really good
Is there the original photograph of said dog?
Holly smokes! Amazing job! 
So...you put paint on this dog and then took a picture???
whoa i thought this was a joke
This can't be a painting. This is unreal. You've got some magical hands man. Amazing.
You PAINTED that? Holy shit youre good
Wow! This is incredible. Please tell me you're using your amazing talent for some good as a day to day job. 

I can't even draw a goddamn stick figure 
Wow, I was just going through some of your other posts on your profile, you are an incredibly gifted artist!!
This is not a photo?
Beautiful work. 
You are a fraud, ffs that must be a real dog. Otherwise u got skills my friend 
Amazing. Do you by chance have a perfect Afro and refer to trees as being happy?..

Seriously though, that's unbelievable.
Wow this is amazing 
Amazing ! 
Amazing. 
I couldn't believe this was really a painting but after looking through your facebook (didn't wanna add more load to your website just in case) I am in awe! Holy smokes your (dog) portraits are insane!
'I took a photo of a dog for another Reddit user, I hope you enjoy.'

FTFY ain't no way I'm believing that's a painting buddy 

Edit: just curious how big is the canvas?
Might as well just print a wallpaper at this point damn
so amazing!!
Wow that’s awesome
This is what I love about this site, seeing amazing artists. Beautiful job!
What does the photo reference look like? Why would you paint out of focus areas and add noise? Just to make it look like a photo? What's the point? You've turned yourself into a human printer. It's impressive, but why not just frame the original photo instead, since it probably looks nearly identical?
Seriously, if this were a photo, it would be a great photo. That you painted this is beyond amazing. The reflection in the eyes is just....great job, OP. Great, great stuff.
I’m calling shenanigans 
Thought that was a photo for a moment there.
I don't believe you painted this.  Enjoy the compliment if you did.
This is incredible. I'm having a lot of trouble believing this is a painting!
Now you've painted it for all reddit users
This is the most realistic painting I’ve ever seen. Amazing job!!
AMAZING!! 😲
You even managed to get the goddamn reflection in its eye 
Tell me this isn't an original Hitler
Please shown is the painting process in a video, this is so crazy indistinguishable from a photo.
I tried to photograph [my dog](https://imgur.com/gallery/Po7dt)...
I'm not entirely convinced this isn't just a picture haha
Is this a photo of the dog you painted?
And I can't even get my mom to drive me to the store.
I don't know how you managed to imitate the focus of a camera but it's amazing
I believe it, but I still don't believe it 
In the left eye, it looks like a reflection of a man in a baseball cap holding a camera with both hands crouched down. 
I couldn’t believe it was a painting.  Looks amazing!
I really hope you make a living off of selling paintings. Your sooo good enough.
Wow! That's amazing
You... you painted this? This is beautiful and adorable.

OP you have great talent, keep it up.
You are an incredible artist. 
You should use your talent drawing something that cant be achieved with a camera.
The reflection in the pups eyes blew my mind.  Excellent work!
Definitely would have thought this was a photo if I wasn't told otherwise
Looking over your post history for more paintings, it’s amazing to see the progress you’ve made. If you go a few years back, your paintings have changed so much in technique and overall look. It’s amazing. 
it's the eyes that do it. you know how to do eyes
I did enjoy! 
Wow, really? You are gonna shame a Saint Bernard by painting it skinnier than it was?
I hate to be that guy but....nm. Have your fun...
I’m almost not convinced this is a painting, looks like a high res photo. amazing!
Dude the light reflecting off the saliva on the dogs tongue.... how?? I don’t have the mental capacity to create this kind of art.
Holy shit dude, amazing
Bullshit!
Holy crap. This is a masterpiece! Well done. 
You put a filter over a photograph, nice.
This is disturbing how realistic it looks.
Holy fuck is this good 
Turns out my girlfriends dog has prostate cancer and has at most three months to live. Would you be interested in another puppy painting? PM me and I can send you the photo if your interested. :)
If Love to think I can paint but this hyper realism... can't do it. So damn impressive
For reference, how large is this?
The noise effect on the tongue. Is this from jpeg artifact or really added for photo realism by the artist? 
Do you do commissions? If so PM me with the fees cause I would love to get a portrait of my son's dog for him for Christmas.
Looks too much like a picture..
Incredible! 
It hurts to know your quality is as if it’s a picture... good for you. That’s a good boy right there if I’ve ever seen one in my life. 
I thought this was a photo. Extreme talent here!
😎 What if I told you this picture of a dog is a painting?
You have some serious talent my friend.
Bruh.....I want to call busllhit but I also want to tell you great job! I’m conflicted 
Now this is ART. Most modern art is shitty. This is amazing 
"I painted a good dog for another Reddit user" ftfy. 
You even painted the individual hairs. This is amazing!
Was so good, I thought you meant you painted a real life dog a different color. Not that you painted the dog itself.
I don't understand how this is a painting.. incredible....
are you sure you painted this 
....how? Your talent is fascinating 

Edit: please PM me your website too!
Wait... you said painted?
What if this is actually a photo and he just pulled off the troll of the century
Holy shit
This is so incredible. The detail on the mouth is absolutely nuts. Bravo mate!
You can't tell me that this is a painting.
That's a painting!!!??? Wow! Nice job!!!
Holy fuck
This isn't a painting
Enjoy your upvotes !! You earned them 
Wow I can’t believe this is a painting. You did an amazing job! It so realistic it looks like a picture!
incredible. I draw a lot and I'm garbage, but I admire the craft and love your clear dedication to it. Super good.
Can I catch the link from you? I’ve got a couple that I might be interested in having painted. 
Do you have any other paintings you would share with us? I need more of this, it's so detailed and beautiful
Wow! Amazing work. 
Can we see the original picture for comparison?
I am annoyed that this is a painting since it looks just liek a photo
What really sells it is the small drip of drool on the chin.
Holy fuck, It's hard to believe that was painted! I thought it was a picture!
Nicely done! Impressive 
This is the best painting I think I've ever seen. It looks like a real photograph! 
This is the most realistic painted I've ever seen great job
Amazing!  👏 👏 
No way
Gotta ask.. how much would it cost to commission you for one of these .. if Reddit hasn’t already drowned u in requests 
From someone who doesn’t know anything about painting, this is amazing. 
Absolutely amazing, such talent!!!
What a good doggo
That is crazy good! Anyway we can see the original photo? I understand if not. 
Amazing work. 
Painted??? Fuuuuuuucccckkkkk... i cant even paint with words.. awesome work.
Op you're truly talented. My mind was blown when I zoomed in on the reflection in its eyes. 
He looks like a good boy
Set as my desktop background :D
This has to be a photograph because it's so picture perfect.
You didn’t just *paint* a dog, you *made* a dog. This is incredibly realistic!
I thought you were trolling. That's an insanely detailed painting. That's serious talent.
Will you paint my dog for me?
Really looks like a photo of a dog, not a painting. Which means you have done an exceptional job and are a divine artist!
God looks like a photo, you're a genius.
This looks beautiful! You're extremely talented, keep doing what you do! 🤗👍
Wow. I like this doggo
jesus christ
are your sure your paintbrush didn’t morph into a camera
Wait wait wait... you painted? This is so realistic. 
This is simply amazing. Do you have any site we can check more of your work?
Reddit users anonymous can help you
Holy jesus, that's amazing. 
You would have been given gold several times if that was a cat. 
It looks so much like my Murciélago!
Wow!!
Did you paint each hair individually?!
Good try but that’s a picture. 😉
This is so amazing, I want to believe you painted this, but my mind says this is a photograph. Amazing work!!! 
ohh its enjoyed

Incredible. 
no way! my brain was short-circuiting just now for a few seconds!! I'm reading 'painted' but i'm seeing 'photo'...???!!?!?!?
Hey hey hey wait a second! First I thought this was a photograph, then I read the title and thought okay this is painted in photoshop but holy hell you actually painted this with real brushes and real canvas! Christ you're good!
This ain't no painting!!!
Incredible!! 
What medium did you use?
This is a painting? W T F
Yea good one.  Thats a picture you took. (Ps. Teach me master)  
That's extraordinary
How long does it typically take you to paint something like this?
If a painting were to come to life...it would be this one 
So amazing!!!
Is this the painting of the dog or the dog you painted?
Wow that is amazing work!
awesome, thank you for sharing...did you paint from a photo or photos?

Wow.
I refuse to believe it's a painting, I've never seen anything like it so detailed with no obvious brush marks. You need to do another painting and do a time lapse. Only then will I believe 100% 
Like...I can tell that it's paint, but I can't *really* tell that it's paint... looks like a photograph. Well freakin done. 
There's a lot of good art on reddit, but I rarely see something that just captures life in a subject in this way. Amazeballs. Unless you were actually trying to paint a pug. 
Magnificent. I don't even have the right word. 
That's insane!  Know clue it was a painting. How much do you charge for something like that?
I'm so jealous you have the time and patience to perfect your skills in the arts of painting, I wish I could get like you.
I looked through your posts u/hara-kiri , and it looks like you are really good at recreating a photo with paint. I’m going to TRUST you and believe that this is a painting. What I want to see is something of your own creating. Rather than just painting Mr. Fox, Kylo Ren, a teacher, or dogs, come up with something. Don’t use a reference photo. CREATE rather than REPLICATE. I’d love to see you come up with something. Because you have talent. 
I don’t believe you!!!!!
Wow, I’m blown away. This is a gorgeous painting and I would be honored to receive it from an internet stranger. Thank you for taking the time to make something like this. 
Painting? Wow
Bull. Shit. This is a fookin picture. 
You painted the eye booger on there? 
Why is the middle portion of the snout so blurry when the portions of the face that are in front and back of it are in focus? Was this intentional?
Amazing
little dog
Wow! That looks like a real life photo! Supremely talented!
Phenomenal job!
You have tricked my eye at first glance.  Beautiful work. 
Being a photographer I can see its a painting but like every body the first look also surprised me as digital copy.
Incredible. 
That's a picture 

I barely have the patience to respond to redditors...

I'm calling bullshit. This is a picture, the nose is out of focus...
Wow it trompe l'oeil (fools the eye).

Finally I can use the French thing I learned in english lit class!
This will end up at the bottom of this comment thread but as someone who doesn't know art I think this is incredible. 
Took a photo* just kidding. You're seriously talented.
Wheres the painting? 
That's incredible, I can hardly believe that's a painting. It looks like a picture! 
I can't even tell this is a painting!
What color was it before? (That's awesome work!)
What do you mean pained - this is amazing!! How do I commission you? Do you have a page? 
How
Could have fooled me. Great work.
Looks so real wow
This is not a painting.
Looking at your other pieces, I'd definitely say this is probably the most photo-realistic.
How long does it take for you to do each of these paintings?
holy shit look at the eyebrows those are strokes 
Sorry, I thought you said you took a painting.  I didn't realized I'd be looking at a photograph!  /s
This would be way more impressive if I could actually see the process in action. There's no way to know how much assistance was used.
That is amazing.
why is there a reflection of the cameraman in the eyes if this is a painting
So what you're saying is you printed a picture of a dog on a canvas. There's no way that's painted. Nope.
Holy shit, excuse my Irish but, seriously holy shit!!
Fake. 
This is paint? Wow
....THAT'S A FUCKING PAINTING!?
Proof its not a photo!
Wow, if I couldn't see the texture of whatever you painted on in a couple places I would have thought this was real. 

Props to you OP, great job!
You painted this? I would have bet my life that this is a photo. Nicely done. 
Geez Louise that's amazing.
If I had a dog I would also like a painting to hang 
**WTF?????!!??**
how much did you charge?

I zoomed in and instinctively tried to wipe the crud out of his eye.....
That's truly fucking amazing!
How long does it paint something like that? I have no idea, could be a week or 6 years.
Can I commission you to paint a picture of my cat?
Thats clearly not a painting. 
I refuse to believe that’s not a photo of a dog
Really nice photo! Almost looks like a painting.
Holy hell!
You even did little specs of dander. Well dond
Omg... do you think you could paint one for me??
I dont see any paint on that dog.  I would ask for my money back if i had asked you to paint my dog and he stayed clean. 
If you told me this was a picture of an actual dog I would have believed it
This is beyond incredible talent! 
I'm almost mad about how I wouldn't have known this was a painting unless you told us. Seriously this is amazing.
No way this is a painting
EDIT :::::: got to trusting of the internet steered back to the logic lane.  Comment deleted 
You might be better than Bob Ross
How long did it take you to do this? It looks so real.
Adorable
Holy shit!
Please, next time post the creative process.
How much $? I would love to get one of my pup Timber. 
What's your website? This is amazing and would be interested in getting one done
Your art is the best art of all the art. 
if its so good you cant tell if its a painting or a photograph, just take a picture
This is a painting? 
Holy shit this is unbelievable, I couldn’t believe this was painted outstanding work :)
Don't lie, you took a photo 

/s
my thoughts 


"painted a dog.. that doesn't look like a pain- DID HE PAINT ON A DOG?!.... no there no paint on that dog its a painting... THAT'S A PAINTING?"
