THE DOG WAS ADOPTED!!! I went to the Inland Valley Humane Society in Pomona the day he went up for adoption but before the adoption completely went through, another interested adopter showed up so they had to raffle him off to one of us. So he did get adopted, just not by me! And probably not by OP lol

You own a dog now right???
Omg this poor little pup. Where is he? Maybe someone here will see him and go take him home. 
Those are the eyes of a sad pupper. Really hope he finds a home soon.

Edit: [He's been adopted!](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/actm1b/adopt_dont_shop_was_so_hard_not_to_let_go/edba8z2)
#Please go back.
Well, did you take him/her home? Did you? OP, confirm! 
OP has previously posted in So Cal. If this dog is anywhere in southern California, I will pick him/her up today. 
When a pup "grabs" and pulls your hand towards themselves, it's an amazing feeling. They want you in their life so bad, that even without opposable thumbs, they still want to hold your hand. That pup will make someone's house a home.
Was so hard to not let go = was easy to let go

r/titlegore
I hope you adopted the poor baby. 
omg my heart is broken even more than it already was
*Sarah McLachlan Music Playing*
I scrolled through these comments look for the answer that you adopted this adorable little bastards and I am thoroughly disappointed in you OP for breaking everyone's heard. ANSWER EVERYONES QUESTION!
Please tell me u took him home
OP you better answer or at least admit you took this video from somewhere else haha. There are some sharp pitchforks waiting in this thread. If you were there looking for a pup and didn‚Äôt take that dog I want to cry. If you were there and not looking for a pup I want to cringe haha. If this is just a random video you found we may be able to forgive you, a smidge. 
#Dƒ∞D YOU ADOPT ƒ∞T OH MY GOD
Don't Post this shit unless u have a follow up post with a goddarn good boy in your car!

&#x200B;
Where is this dog? I have just enough money to fly to him and adopt him. We will have to figure out a way home, but that is how Cosmo and I roll. 

&#x200B;

...I named him Cosmo.
If you adopted this dog, that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you didn't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will teach you the error of your ways.
This is so heartbreaking... Someone please adopt this dog üòüüòüüòü
I feel like this is persons account fake. They have only had an account for 8 days and this post history is kind of all over the place. I want to find this puppy and adopt it myself!
I don't understand "adopt, don't shop". Is this an American thing? Where I live pet stores get their pets mostly from the humane society, so it makes no difference if you go to the store or the shelter.
Was so hard TO let go? *
LAST UPDATE (hope some of you see this)

1) I was looking for a potential doggo to adopt as an emotional support animal. For my school, you can apply to have one through a pretty tedious process. 

2) athough my suitemates were initially cool, one of them backed out last second.

3) THE DOG HAS BEEN ADOPTED! I went the very next day because I wanted to make it work or do something (I ended up donating supplies), but found out the sweetie was adopted. 

4) I wasn‚Äôt karma farming. I wanted to share how deserving and sweet shelter doggos are, as is pretty evident through the video!!

5) Location: Inland Humane Society in Pomona CA.

6) this is my video!
r/donthelpjustfilm
Unpopular opinion here, but "adopt don't shop" is not the solution to the problem. It's literally a reaction to the end of the line and it ignores all the previous issues that led to this problem. Adopted/rescued dogs end up in shelters all the time too. "Adopt, don't shop" is a solution to puppy mills and unethical backyard breeders, but the problem is much larger than that. I hate to say it, but many times, rescue/shelter dogs are very inexpensive to get and overcrowded shelters are quick to give dogs to people without the financial resources to take care of the dog, while more expensive pure breed dogs end up in homes where people can afford to give them the care that they require. That's why you don't see a lot of pure breed dogs in shelters. 

There are many underlying problems with the entire system that should be doing a much better job at regulating the welfare of animals. There is such a huge lack of awareness of puppy mills. People who buy at pet stores simply don't know what they are contributing towards; quite the opposite, they think that's the correct way of buying dogs and they trust that the business is reputable and ethical when it comes to obtaining puppies. But we all know it's the opposite; so where are the PSA like click it or ticket? Literally, every car has a built-in alarm mandated by government regulation that you have to wear your seat-belt and we still get bombarded with click-it-or-ticket PSAs. Another issue is that people are not fully aware the level of work or money that a dog requires. There's a lot of people getting siberian huskies and living in apartments and have no idea how energetic or vocal they can be. There are not enough PSAs about clarifying the misconceptions of owning a dog; how to train them, how to feed them, etc. And the biggest offender in my opinion, people don't know what their options are when they realize they can't take care of the dog; too many people abandon them on the street, take them to kill-shelters, or list them for free on craigslist where the cycle is likely to repeat for the poor dog. There needs to be PSAs about all the local rescue groups that can take care of the dog of help foster them and find a suitable new owner. Other things that come to mind; flipping puppies for profit should be illegal, meaning that you can't deceive someone into giving you their dog (free or for sale) with the hidden intention or re-selling the dog at a higher price, this happens a lot around the holidays. The punishment for dog fighting should be far more severe and there needs to be more PSAs about these punishments. Pet stores should not be allowed to sell dogs unless they are working with a shelter/rescue group. The store conditions need to be much better than they are now. If you go to a Petland, you'll see 2-4 puppies in a tiny crate where they breath their own feces and urine 24-7. Those crates/cages need to be much larger and if the puppy does not sale in 1 week, to goes to a rescue group where it can have access to playing and running in a yard. Purebreed dogs should be a thing and there's a place for responsible breeding. This needs to be far more heavily regulated with a much higher financial challenge to get into it so dumbo in rural Mississippi doesn't lock up a few stolen dogs into breeding puppies nonstop that will be sold to pet stores. It should require a license and it should not be the main source of income for the household that wants to breed pure dogs. Females dogs should be allowed to breed only twice in their lifetime and they oughta be the homeowner's pets, not moneymaking machines. This is how it works with most show dogs that are really expensive. We also need PSA's to teach people that dogs experience feelings of love, fear, pain, and suffering just like people. Too many dumb dumb people think animals in general "don't understand" anything and are immune to neglect and such. "Adopt, don't shop" is treating the end of the chain of all this issues. We need to focus on the source a bit more and prevent that dogs end up in shelters in the first place.
r/PetTheDamnDog
YOU BETTER HAVE ADOPTED IT YOU FUCK
y‚Äôall asking OP, they just stole the content
WE HAVE TO GO BACK
Where is this??!! TELL US 

Edit: Y‚Äôall just let me know when my pitchfork is appropriate. 
Okay, now I'm sad 
This is why I don‚Äôt go to shelters... I have two dogs already... I‚Äôd come home with like 10 more
ALRIGHT OP LOOK WE NEED AN ANSWER. THE PEOPLE ARE GETTING ANTSY. WE ARE SHARPENING OUR PITCHFORKS. WE NEED TO KNOW THAY YOU TOOK THAT GOOD DOGGO HOME. WE NEED CLOSURE. WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US. 
Its been  4 hours /r/pc125558, plz reply and take the load off our shoulders. Please.
I hope you adopted this adorable puppy ‚ù§Ô∏è
Where the heck is this?  OP!  Tell us. 
if you did not adopt this dog, please give us Pet-ID number, name  and location of the shelter, so this dog can be networked and adopted. thank you! 
Here‚Äôs a more detailed update:

(I sleep in one day... yeesh!)

1) I wasn‚Äôt karma farming y‚Äôall! I was lookinng for a potential pupper to adopt at the Inland Humane Society in Pomona, CA.

2) couldn‚Äôt end up adopting this sweetie because my suitemates/ roomate was uncomfortable keeping a dog in our dorm. (Allowed as an emotional support animal)

3) I‚Äôve adopted before and will continue to do so after I graduate and have a place. Also, donate supplies like me of you can‚Äôt directly adopt! Shelters are always in need of blankets, food, etc. 
You better have adopted that fucking dog I swear, if you haven't you beTTER GO BACK RIGHT NOW! I'LL FIGHT YA
You should shop for the right dog for your lifestyle and personality, whether you buy the dog from a reputable breeder or you buy the dog from a shelter. To do any less is a disservice to the dog and to yourself/your family. 
OP wtf???? Where is this dog located???? Someone will adopt!!!
If you didnt get this dog, did you get another?

If neither, were you going with somebody else who adopted?

If no, then why did you go there?
This is why I can't stand to be in places like this, or even pet shops that sell pets. It just tears me apart to see them like that, caged up in these small, cramped spaces, desperate for companionship and attention. Doubly so when it's a young puppy like this, the poor thing.
That dog would now be a part of my family
Honestly, if you didn‚Äôt walk out of there with that dog then you must have a heart of stone. 
thats how I almost adopted a husky. I regret it every day.

Me and this dude had an instant connection. I was at aspca dropping off supplies. It was love at first sight

wife seriously allergic to dogs... :(
I know I'm most likely going to get downvoted to obvilion for this but, people who have cute animals which they've bought from a breeder/unknowningly from a puppy farm shouldn't feel the shame of not posting here. 

I feel like a few posters here have bought an animal and claimed it was adoptrd just so they dont get downvoted to hell.

Ofc its better to adopt than buy but dont let that affect your decision to post here.

This isn't targetted at anyone, nor really relevant, just a small rant I've had in my mind for a while now.
So I can only assume from your title that you adopted him/her then? 
[deleted]
Heart breaking. Hope they took him home
Well you know you've found the one. Congrats on your new dog
I find that they choose you, not the other way around.

I had this happen in a shelter too but it was the dog next to the dog I was initially looking at.  I've had her for eight years now ‚ù§Ô∏è
r/aww or r/reallyfuckingsad
So... it was easy to let go....???
Buying from a reputable breeder is fine. There are shitty shelters out there that buy dogs from puppy mills and BYBs just to sell as "rescues." If you get a dog from a breeder that has a return policy (they take the dog back at any stage of life and will personally rehome it), you aren't contributing to the shelter dog problem. The most important thing is to research the breed (if buying), the breeder, the genetic line or the shelter (if adopting). Most dogs go to shelters because they aren't a "good fit" for the family. Adequate research helps mitigate this. You need to have a breeder that you can trust will produce puppies of similar temperament and true to the breed or a shelter that does thorough temperament testing and is honest about the dogs they are rehoming and selling.
# UH HEY FAM YOU BETTER HAVE ADOPTED THAT PUPPER
The day we adopted our dog from the shelter was the day I understood how much animals want to be loved, but also how much they don't want to return to their cages at the shelter. When I held my dog for the first time, she literally clung to me with a death grip. They had to rip her from me when it came time to sign the adoption papers. She didn't want to let go. She was cold, sick, flea ridden, and so emaciated, she'd lost most of her hair.  She was on the kill list and was going to be put down soon if no one adopted her. I'm glad we gave her a second life. Today, she is the sweetest, most loving and intuitive dog I've ever had (and I've had several dogs). I'm happy that she has a life so vastly different from the life we knew her to have. 

So, yes, ADOPT! These animals understand far more than we realize. Save them and love them. 
I would have taken him home and figured everything out later.
wait, "was so hard not to let go", what does that mean am I just being dumb or 


1) I was looking for a potential doggo to adopt as an emotional support animal. For my school, you can apply to have one through a pretty tedious process.

So if it was so hard not to let go... it was easy to let go? Double negs get ya every time.
HAVE YOU ADOPTED IT FOR GOD SAKE?!!
I'm not even the person in this video and I feel guilty for not adopting this pupper.
If you didn't adopt the dog I will riot.
Seriously though OP it‚Äôs really rude not to answer people that want to adopt this dog. People are asking where this dog is located so they can rescue and you don‚Äôt reply.
This comment will get lost in the masses, but rescue dogs truly are the best. Both of my current pups are rescue and they have the biggest hearts and biggest personalities. I wouldn‚Äôt trade them for anything. 
Adopt OR shop. If you want a specific breed, want to pick out a puppy all your own, go for it. There is no shame. Just remember adopting is an equally viable option :) 
So was that you in the picture? Did you adopt or just post for karma?
You took him/her home right !?!?! The goodest of dogs
I would've 100% taken this as a sign and adopted 
No answer from OP, I bet they‚Äôre busy at home PLAYING WITH THEIR NEWLY ADOPTED PUPPER
Where is he? Post details. Someone here might want him! 
Omg reply op - where is this doggo?!
If you're near Newport Beach, CA apparently that's where OP is so you can go and adopt this dog since OP didn't.
Did you adopt him?! Tell us OP, don't you leave us like this
I got my purebred black lab from a breeder and I love her very much, however once she gets older and needs a friend I believe I will really adopt because it kills to see pups like this...but they didn‚Äôt have any black labs in my local shelter and this was a great breeder (not a puppy mill)
I cried a little inside 
Something tells me they didn‚Äôt adopt :( 

Or they‚Äôre taking longer to reply cause they‚Äôre in the process of adopting and don‚Äôt wanna come back empty handed lol

Or they‚Äôre just getting rid of this account after all the questions

*sigh*
His account is only 8 days old. He clearly doesn't the rules for posting sad stories about animals.

REDDIT NEEDS CLOSURE MATE. YOU MAY HAVE A 'LIFE' BUT WE NEED TO KNOW! IS. THE. PUPPY. O.K?? 


Please tell me you adopted this dog. 
FUCKING ADOPT THE DOG YOU COWARD
Please tell me you took him home 
Please adopt him oh my god my heart is breaking 
3 hours and no update

*do you hear the people sing*
I believe in California it's now illegal to by cats or dogs from pet shops
I'm laughing at all the people commenting on OP's past comments asking if he/she adopted the dog. 

I was ready to do the same until i seen you all got everything locked down. 

Did you adopt the dog?
Well??????????? We're waitinnnnng. 


Did op adopt it or what . I feel like either the dog or OP is going to be on a milk carton if we don't get an answer soon.
Paw through the kennel door is exactly how my rescue girl chose me many years ago. She was 8 months old at the time. She lived with me for 13 years. I miss her every day. Both my current furs are also rescue. Best dogs in the world. 
#THIS DOG BETTER BE WITH YOU RN OR I'M TELLING ON YOU 
I want to adopt one so bad, but I have very limited space in my condo. It would still be a better life than what the little guy is having there, but it would break my heart to see it laying around all the time and not having space to run.
When you look for a dog, they say you adopt  the dog that chooses you. Well, I think this doggo has chose you!
That dog picked you, go get the sweetheart! 
if op doesnt adopt the dog he will gladly be added to r/peoplereddithates

Hard NOT to let go?  I'm confused ü§î
This is absolutely killing me. The OP had to surrender this dog to a shelter? The title is badly worded. 
Can someone find this shelter and adopt the dog?
I don‚Äôt want a dog and I‚Äôm pretty sure I would have had no choice but to take that one home. 
Can we "friendly" dox the op so she can tell us where this dog is ?
I‚Äôm going to go hug my dog now. 
But, but... If I didn't shop, [this wouldn't be the face I wake up to every morning!](https://imgur.com/a/2F9eEs2)

Dogs deserve a good home. That's all.
OP if you‚Äôre too nervous to tell us because you didn‚Äôt adopt him, you can inbox me and let me know where this dog is so that I can comment and let everyone know and we can hopefully get this good boy adopted!...
Dammit, this reminds me of when Dumbo's mama was locked up and was desperate to touch her baby and now I'm crying at work ‚òπÔ∏è
Where is this dog i will come adopt it right now 
Glad to hear the little guy got a adopted.
I feel we should have an adoption subreddit if there isnt already one 
Was so hard to let go, you mean?

'Was so hard not to let go' implies that it was difficult to hold on, which doesn't seem to be what you meant to say. 
There was a law recently passed in the state of California he hat pet shops can no longer sell purebred dogs and that they just sell dogs from shelters, which is cool
‚ÄòSo hard TO let go‚Äô how could you get that wrong??
I got in touch with OP!!!!

They stated by direct message this [message](https://imgur.com/gallery/SGcHRJ5)

This is why I just can‚Äôt go to places like that. I just want to take them all home. And that‚Äôs not feasible unfortunately. So sad ppl treat their animals like they are just replaceable 
I don't think op took good puppers home. Leading us to believe they posted this shit for karma. PROVE ME WRONG OP I DARE YOU!
This was how we adopted our old dog, Buster. Just as we were leaving he put his little paw out and I held it. I called my family back, and we rescued him. Best dog we ever had, he lived with us for fourteen years. 
Would anyone else not want this dog? Call me cold hearted, but he looks like the kind of dog that would have insane anxiety every time you left the house, and would cling to you non-stop every waking hour. I feel awful for the dog, and he/she obviously needs a good home, but damn that‚Äôs going to be an endless drain of attention.
If OP didn't adopt it, then mods should remove this.. it's sad content
I‚Äôll do what I want with my money thnx
OP said it was "so hard not to let go"...

He or she did NOT say "so hard to let go".

Meaning they adopted the pup. Everyone can calm down now. This pupper is in good hands. 
This could be my dog‚Äôs littermate! Aussie paws, Rottweiler facial markings... [This was him as a pup. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/p1l27)

Just saying, "was so hard not to let go" is a double negative, if it was hard NOT to let go, then it was easy to let go. You meant to say that "it was so hard to let go".

The last place I looked at adopting from required my employer's contact info for a reference check AND a home visit. If places really want you to adopt and not buy, they need to stop making the adoption process harder than a job interview.

&#x200B;

Right now, I'm basically just waiting to find a stray cat or for someone to post a "kittens to a new home" flyer. The shelters where I live are insane and usually have 6+ page adoption applications, the above mentioned requirements, credit checks, the option to take back the animal if you do ANYTHING they don't like such as letting it outside even on a leash (cat), etc, etc.
All our dogs have been bums or jailbirds from the pound. Great pets! This one reminds me of our Rascal (RIP boy!)
Where is this dog.
I'm not crying you're crying!
!remindme 1 day
Yea so I‚Äôll film it and put it on Reddit instead of adopting
Tell that to the old dog next door that isn't adorable.
soooooooo we want a update, where is the dog at?
:----(
Adopting is the way to go. I worked at, what was known at the time as, the Delco SPCA in Media, PA. I did the intake of all animals. 

We would save animals from the south, since they usually throw the animals in gas chambers. They put adult dogs in first then throw puppy‚Äôs in top of the dead dogs. Same with the cats. Watch the documentary: ‚ÄúOne nation under Dog‚Äù. I can‚Äôt remember exactly the wording, but once saw a cat with a collar that said when it was going to be put down. 95% of the animals, now called providence animal center, are saved from the south. 

Tl;dr - adopt!! They kill them if not 
Downvote for not taking him home. üëé
Both my pups were adopted, as were most of the pups in my family growing up.

If you can't adopt, please consider volunteering at your local animal shelter.
[deleted]
Someone tell me they adopted. If not, me and my good boy will be going there to pick up our new buddy!
Im not even a dog person and this brought me to tears.  OP please fucking update us. Did you bring him home? If not, reply to those asking what city this is so someone else can go get him!! 
Please, if you know you can't raise it because you don't have money, don't adopt it. Don't listen to the comments telling you to take him if you know you'll be struggling.
Was so hard to let go* unless it was hard holding him.

So it was easy to let go?
If you aren‚Äôt able to give them a home, you could let us know the location and it‚Äôs possible that they could find a home today. 
NOO WHAT A GOOD BOYEEE
OP is sitting there looking at these thinking ‚Äúman I thought it‚Äôd be cool to get some cute karma, didn‚Äôt think all these people liked dogs,  time for a new handle‚Äù
Did OP adopt the dog or am I going to have to fly across the country?
Why isn't this something that is said to people having (or trying to have) kids?

Carbon footprint wise, it sure does seem to make sense. Plus there are tons of kids in the foster system. 
"Adopt, don't shop"

Also...  "So hard to let go"  
So you just shopped?
On the other side of the argument, if you aren't able to adopt a dog because circumstances, shelters are MORE than happy to let you volunteer to come in and take the dogs on walks and play with them, usually after a short training.
It has a massive, proven effect on their attitudes, keeps them from getting shelter shock while they wait for a forever home and is a lot of fun.
So hard not to let go? As in you desperately wanted to get away from the dog? 
Adopt that dog you fucking terrorist.
**IT'S BEEN 4 HOURS NOW OP ANSWER US**
TAKE HIM HOME U MONSTER
I think the title implies that it was easy to let go, can I get a grammer Nazi to confirm my assessment? 
Reddit is on the hunt
For everyone getting angry, we don't really know the circumstances. We don't know if they opted for an older dog who wouldn't get adopted, we don't know if they are workers/volunteers at that shelter and can't take dogs home everday, etc. Because of his age, that puppy will likely be adopted by someone else, and maybe OP knew that, but had a hard time NOT adopting them for one reason or another. 
If you didn‚Äôt take him you‚Äôve got to let me know where the good boy is. üò¢üò¢
**IF YOU DIDN'T ADOPT THAT FUCKING DOG I WILL FIND WHERE YOU LIVE** and adopt him myself. please. do the right thing.

Who the HECK buys dogs from breeders/mills anymore??? >:(
This literally breaks my heart. All that dog wants is a warm house, good food and a family that he can love. That‚Äôs it. Just wants a family to love and a place to be safe. 
Every dog I‚Äôve owned, both as a child and now as an adult, has been some sort of rescue. 
Please...get rescue animals. Each of these dogs deserves a happy home. 
I cry when I think about where my two dogs came from. The first was abused by their owner and terrified of men. Now she‚Äôs the happiest dog I‚Äôve ever seen and a great therapy animal for my wife. 
Our second dog was a stray we found running down a busy road. We managed to catch her and tried to find her home but couldn‚Äôt. She was a mess. Fur matted, starving, her du claw(spelling) fall off and her paws were raw and bleeding. 
But now she‚Äôs a perfect lapdog that is a total sweetheart. 
I can‚Äôt imagine my life without my dogs. You don‚Äôt need the expensive puppy mill dogs. You can save a dogs life and TRUST ME, you can feel how grateful they are for saving their life. 
I'm crying 
Why would you post something like this? It‚Äôs heartbreaking. Get the dog already. Don‚Äôt show us how sad he is when he gets abandoned again. 
A coworker of mine was so excited that she was getting a new dog, telling everybody about it, trying to think of a name and everything. I was so happy for her until I heard her say, "yeah he cost me $1,200." 

I didn't say anything to not ruin her excitement (specially since her last dog died about a year ago), but man I was disappointed.
Oh my god. Oh my god. I am bawling. This is so sad. 
I dislike when people decide not to adopt dogs. There are plenty of these guy as shown in the video looking for love. I‚Äôm not much of a dog person myself but I will definitely be adopting when I get a cat
It‚Äôs was so hard NOT to let go??
Adoption POV
The breed looks like Greater Swiss Mountain dog, now I want one too.
He double commited to that handshake 
Holy shit this one really got my heart in a headlock.. adopt that pupper for the love of humanity!

You don't deserve upvotes unless you adopted the dog.

Where is this dog? My kids and I want it, they're literally begging where is he? OP needs to tell us ugh
Rescued is the only option for me.  I adopted 2 kittens 8 yrs ago and had to say goodbye to one, Hazel, a couple of weeks  ago.  As sad as it was I kept thinking what would her life have been like if I hadn't taken her home.  Olive, the other one, picked me by climbing up my arm and perching on my shoulder.  She still does!  Best decision I ever made.  Hope this lil pup is as lucky as my girls were.
Touching sentiment but I think you meant it was hard to let go? Maybe I am slow today but I read this as it was difficult to hold on.
What do you mean it was hard not to let go? You mean you didn‚Äôt like holding onto the dog?
I really hope OP adopted him. 
God, that killed me to watch
This is nice but dont feel pressured to adopt. Sometimes you get a dog that gets separation anxiety as soon as you are gone and start tearing everything apart.


Tell us you got that dog! Please, I'm dying here in the UK for this dog. I need to know. 
If they live in Newport this can also be the Huntington Beach humane society on Newland street. Someone go get this baby. 
Omg there go my eyes and my heart üò≠
Omg heart broken. I don't own a dog because I live in apartment which doesn't allow pets. i need to find a pet friendly area and a big pupper who doesn't mind being in a small apartment while I'm at work
Then take the dog
What a cutie 
"Both paws!! ...no no that's silly just one paw. Continue please."

Soooo cute.
I always wanted to adopt but I find that some rescue homes make it so difficult to adopt them. I know they are just protecting the pooches from potential no gooders, but I would have loved to have adopted as well as getting our puppy xxxxx
I hope OP adopted poor good boye. That face.... 
Awww. What a love.
Awww man, thank god the dog was adopted. 
Sooo it was easy to let go? I dont really understand the title
Everyone would stop brigading you if you just told us if you got the fucking dog
/r/getthedamndog
Sorry, pup - I just came here for the karma
Never thought I‚Äôd utter this phrase in my life but u/cooter_vomit, thank you for the follow up to ensure that pupper was given a home. Definitely needed that today.
>So hard *not* to let go

So... you wanted to let go?
I think you mean *Was hard to let go 


Now I‚Äôm crying at work thanks 
Aww...... unsubscribed. 
Some adoption groups are unnecessarily restrictive with their rules. Several I have found out right refuse to adopt out any dog to families with kids under a certain age. They refuse to even consider the potential adopter's past experience.

This is something that should be on a case by case basis, and they are preventing themselves from finding great homes for a lot of pets.
Exactly how our doggo got us. Walking by and did the old paws out trick and we fell for it and don‚Äôt regret getting him for a second.
It was so hard not to let go? 
It was easy to let go?
So it was really easy to let go huh?
*it's all adoption wither its from a breeder or shelter, just fyi*


While I don't go to shelters because I personally want to know what kind of dog I am getting from puppy to adult. I am happy this dog found a home but frankly im not surprised, puppies are normally adopted first unless they have an extreme behavior problem or sickness (and even then some people might tough it out if the pup bonds with them). All the same, if you want to adopt, adopt just make sure you fix your pets so videos like this will be few an in between.
I bought my dog, and he‚Äôs the bestest boy. 
Two of the best dogs I've ever known were adopted from IVHS in Pomona. They have awesome dogs and I highly encourage anyone in the area to adopt from there. 
u/radicalrelativity
No, plz I can‚Äôt handle this much cuteness. Humans should be caged and dogs should run the government 
I wish I could adopt a dog, but I don't have the means right now and it breaks my heart to see this
My heart üíî
Oh wow the one non pit
How could you possibly resist him??
I've had multiple animals and I never understood buying them. There was always someone with kittens or puppies they couldn't keep, or shelters and animal rescue places.
Ok now this is just too cute üò≠
My heart...I would've been signing those adoption papers in tears as I sobbed uncontrollably.
That pupper, so sweet and beautiful!! Ugh. Someone's chopping onions in here. 
Technically you just said it was hard to hold on to him. Should have been "hard to let go"
what happens to pets in a store that don‚Äôt get bought?
It was hard not let go? So it was easy to let go?
Oh my goodness, the constant barking and chaos of those scared dogs in the shelters breaks my heart every single time. :(
üíûüòå
I bailed my boy outta doggy prison too. We been riding together for 9 years. 
Adoption is the way to go! My pretty girl passed in July, it was horrible and I'm still grieving,  but that pretty thing was the most beautiful gift the universe gave to me. My girl was with me for 12 years and as much as it sucked she's gone, I wouldn't change it for anything.  Molly was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
Its okay! He‚Äôs adopted ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Inland humane society pomona ca, check for updates
Its my video.
1) I was looking for a potential doggo to adopt as an emotional support animal. For my school, you can apply to have one through a pretty tedious process. 

2) athough my suitemates were initially cool, one of them backed out last second.

3) THE DOG HAS BEEN ADOPTED! I went the very next day because I wanted to make it work or do something (I ended up donating supplies), but found out the sweetie was adopted. 

4) I wasn‚Äôt karma farming. I wanted to share how deserving and sweet shelter doggos are, as is pretty evident through the video!!

5) Location: Inland Humane Society in Pomona CA.

6) this is my video![shelter doggo holding my hands](https://reddit.app.link/Mm3J0948eT)
Aw thank you!! Being new to reddit doesn‚Äôt help much, but it‚Äôs equally nice to meet lovely individuals like you :)
I‚Äôm so happy that sweet baby has a forever home üíïüíï
I hope you find a pupper soon!!
He'll be a good boy/girl
See, this is why, at 26 yo, I can't go to a shelter without bursting into tears. Because on the one hand, there are dogs like this one who beg to be adopted at the front of their cages. But on the other hand, where I live there are several dogs per cage, and often there are shy and/or scared dogs at the back. They're often ignored. My family dog, who gave us a wonderful 16 years of hugs and kisses, was one such dog. We picked her because the shelter lady recommended her. Had she not done that, we probably wouldn't have noticed her because she was sitting at the back of the cage. She had probably given up because at that point she already went through three homes. For no discernible reason either, she was quiet, patient, never caused any sort of trouble, and ofc she was super affectionate (not that puppy-like behavior is an excuse to ditch a dog, yeah?).  

So anyway, either you ignore all those paws reaching out to you or you ignore the ones that are too shy to do that. The solution there, as far as I'm concerned, is to take super good care of your dogs so that you only have to go back to the shelter and do that Sophie's Choice shit super rarely. 
what was your reaction, when u noticed this was getting blown up! @OP 
thats a highly adoptable dog. 
Dogs are pure goodness. 
Okay, but I'm getting tired of getting shunned because my cats didn't come from a shelter. (I didn't get them from a pet store either, it's just that my aunt's cat likes getting knocked up). 

In the end, it shouldn't matter where our fur babies come from. What should matter is that we give them the best life they can live. 
Holy Jesus Christ LMAO

1) I wasn‚Äôt karma farming, so chill out. I was looking for a dog to adopt.

2) I couldn‚Äôt adopt this particular dog due to size/ and one  roomate wasn‚Äôt not okay with having a dog.


This cutie looks so much my dog, which was also an adoption. I hope this pup, and all other homeless dogs find a good family. üò¢

Edit: why did this get a down vote? Reddit confuses me sometimes. 
Adopt don't shop is a really naive saying.  Move to a coastal city and tell me how many non-pitbull breed puppies there are available... Nothing against pitbulls but if you don't own your home, good luck with breed restriction policies.
Omg üò≠
>Was so hard to not let go

wew lad
This reminded me of when I adopted my precious doggo. I went to brunch with friends, we had a few drinks, and decided to go to the animal shelter. First shelter someone literally adopted the kittens a friend and I wanted to adopt. Second kitty I fell in love with a second shelter, same thing. So I went to look at the dogs. There were some very cute pups. Then I walked up to this kennel that I couldn‚Äôt walk away from. 

Seven years later I‚Äôm lying in bed snuggled with my best friend. Best tipsy decision I‚Äôve ever made. [Adoption to 2018](https://imgur.com/gallery/b4iwndx) 
puppy deserves ALL the karma.  OP deserves none unless (s)he provides proof the adoption occurred...
Paging /u/pc125558. 

#FUCKING ANSWER US
While you're at it, go adopt a *human child* there's plenty of those available.

Oh, what's that? You're not? You're going to have *your own children*? You fucking monsters.

See? Your virtue signaling is bullshit.
I know people want the op to take this dog home based on this very limited reaction.  just because you are at a shelter does not mean you are in a situation where you can take a dog home.  I go to shelters often and have similar experiences. I just can't take any dogs home because I live alone and don't feel comfortable leaving my dog alone for 9 hours a day on it's own. I just love dogs and shelter dogs could all use more human interaction and affection. 
I love adoption, but I think people have gone a bit far with the need to do it.

We rescued our cat from the wild, the other from angel of hope rescue center.. but when it came to our dog, we wanted a cavalier because my wife deals with depression, and we wanted the dog because that breed is notoriously great for snuggling.  However, they have health issues that are alleviated a bit by using a good breeder.

I can't tell you how many times I've been told I'm a shit person for not adopting a dog, but rather finding one that fit our life the best.
I was thinking of adopting however there‚Äôs only two things I prefer. 1- dog needs to be a puppy and 2- what scares me is if it‚Äôs been abused. Also how much does it cost roughly to adopt a dog rather than buying one in a pet store ?
So, what is the status of this pup??
Where is he and how do I find him. 
This made me sad 
This is why there should be stricter laws against breeding dogs. So many people will force the dog to have several litters (just to make money off them), then dogs like this die in the shelter. 
Hard *not* to let go?
So it was easy to let go?
Imagine being this poor pupper and being used as a prop by some poster trying to make some hamfisted message about "adopt don't shop". No shit. Thanks for the depressing clip though. Very pure hearted of you! I am sure the dog is grateful.
How about no and I shop? Lol
Adopt, then shop.  There is nothing wrong with going to the SPCA first and looking for the dog that you want.  If you look through and there‚Äôs nothing that really jumps out at you, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with looking at breeders that have the papers of the breeding dogs and shopping.

If you‚Äôre like me, there‚Äôs nothing but pit bulls and other terrier breeds at the SPCA.  While I love dogs, neither breed are for me, so I look elsewhere 
I really don't understand what you're getting at with the title. If you adopted this pup good on you. If you abandoned the dog and are now karma mining you're an absolute scumbag 
Fuck you OP. Fuck you. My heart is broken at 11:18AM on a Saturday, and now I have to go cuddle my puppy until it is fixed :(
I hate that garbage line. "adopt don't shop" so, what? do pet store animals not deserve love like adoption animals do?
Where is he?!?! i'll come adopt him!!!!!!
Then fucking buy the dog. Dont go to adoption shelters just to fucking look around and window shop. Just going around giving false hope to dogs before turning your ass around and thinking how many likes your video will get. "Oh i was just looking" then dont go in the first place. "Oh i already have a dog." Then get another one and help an animal brother out. Jesus christ. "It was so hard to let go" then fucking dont and get the dog. I dont understand this logic.
I feel like 80% of this subs posts are people who buy puppies. Please adopt.
Adopt at your own risk, lots of dogs got lots of health problems
Oh my heart! 
Aww....üêïüê∂üíûüêæ
Damn hope OP adopted it. 
My soul!!!! üíî
Sweet baby  üíîüíî
The only thing dogs want is to interact with their owner. They don't want to play with other dogs, or on their own. They're obsessed with humans, almost to a fault.
Please tel us you adopted the dog!!!
OP please share where this beautiful pooch is 
Ow my heart!
Buy the dog Nnooowww
If Nebraska, I'm going right now. Lets go!
I‚Äôll never let go. I promise.
How could anyone leave him behind?! üò≠
I never thought I'd be saying this but I hope this is a repost 
I'd adopt this pup.
Adopt don't shop

We've got to know

Did you take that pup home

Don't let go

Don't let go

Can't leave that dog anymore
I had an aneurysm trying to figure out if the title was a simple grammar mistake or a deeper meaning I was not understanding. 
Was so hard not to let go? That means it was easy to let go lolb
Dog chose the owner.
I just adopted two shelter cats and am never shopping again they are so loving and kind. They have cold medicine but they don‚Äôt spit it out or struggle 
If you didn‚Äôt adopt that baby, I hope you pee the bed tonight. 
Where are the grammar nazis?
I‚Äôll fly over to America and adopt the damn thing myself if you won‚Äôt.
Omg.... break my heart üíî
I would literally tear those bars off with my bare hands and if the law doesn't like it then the law can just try to stop me and my new best friend while as drive over state lines.
I‚Äôd find it difficult to walk away
*was so hard to let go, unless youre an ice-cold mofo.
I. Just. Can't. Please. 
Awww, looks just like my girl Sadie who my mum and I rescued , same mannerisms with the handshakes too!
Anyone know where this is?
Ugh. We are waiting for our new rescue and this GIF is killing me. Everyday my husband asks if it's February. This is going to be the longest month of my life!

She's currently at a shelter in Portugal, and is scheduled for paw surgery next week to fix an old injury. Once she's healed in February, she gets to come home to us. 
I want to know how this dog story ends.
This just made me squeeze my rescue baby so hard. He was taken to the shelter by two different owners before me! :(
OP please tell me you adopted this dog ;-;
I swear to god, I‚Äôll jump on the next plane to find out if this little fella was adopted or not. 
I discriminate against shelter dogs. Corgis > life 
Awe my heart is breaking for this little pup! I really hope he was adopted 
OP!!!!! GIVE US AN UPDATE!
When I was looking for a dog the place denied me an application because I asked about the health of the dog. So here I am with my pupper from a breeder. 
I went to the local humane society around a year ago, which was around 2 years after putting my awesome 15 year old poochinski down. I went into where the dogs were and pretty much instantly started sobbing. I had to excuse myself to the critter area while I bawled my eyes out and tried to collect my shit. I've heard the saying that you only get one amazing dog in your life, and mine already came and went. Miss you Molly.
OP!? HELLOOOOO
Did you adopt the dog yet mate?
I stg if you didn‚Äôt adopt the pupper imma cry
u/nickthestick075
Just came here to see if that pupper was adopted...
It makes me so sad to think how many of these animals just want love and never get it
Thank you.  It is the most rewarding job I have ever had and we use primarily shelter dogs.
Really breaks my heart.
Pleaseee adopt him‚ù§
Was so hard to let go? Is that what they mean? I‚Äôm confuse. 
I implore everyone to adopt from rescues, pounds, etc. There are millions of innocent animals that are homeless and suffering and they all deserve homes where they are loved.
The problem here is that if he isn't adopted they will most likely euthanize him happens everyyear to dogs and cats
Where is the dog? 
‚ÄòIt was so hard not to let go‚Äô also means ‚Äòit was so easy to let go‚Äô üòÇ
Those eyes, they cry, every night, for you :( 
This just breaks my heart :(
It‚Äôs likely op is waiting on approval for the adoption application. Same day adoption is rare because they want to do a background check on the adopters.
My heart is melting.

If you didnt take him home fuck you
California just passed a law where pet stores can only sell rescued dogs.

Oh my heart!
Downvoting this, you are a monster
If you left this dog there on that concrete floored cage after that display of affection and cry for help I honestly think you might be a bad person.

Don‚Äôt tell me you just filmed the poor fucking thing then posted online ‚ÄúHey everybody else!!! Adopt!!!!‚Äù

U adopt it?
Guessing it wasn't adopted since post title specifically says "Was so hard NOT to let go.." meaning that if it was adopted, they really didn't want to anyway ü§î
One day I will again
Any update?
Time to go get a second dog
But what if I want a designer fluff puppy to impress people on Instagram?
When you see those big beans appear on the second pull I just melted
/r/PetTheDamnDog/
This goes for other animals besides dogs and cats, too! Many shelters have other animals as well- rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, gerbils, etc. People often don't think to try to adopt a small pet, but they need homes too!

I was a bit sad until the second paw came out.  Now I'm all the way crying.   Sweet sweet pupper!
Out of curiosity what breed is that?

Please tell us you adopted this little guy!
SEND ME THE LOCATION RIGHT NOW 
We have three cats and all were once strays. Two adopted from the shelter and one adopted from the streets by our old apartment. Best damn animals. 

We ended up with a third because we took some food to donate that the first two didn‚Äôt like and wouldn‚Äôt eat. We browsed and noticed a little guy that just seemed in a bad place. He didn‚Äôt quite know how to act and was severely abused. He was put on a hold due to his actions. We went back after his hold ended and said we wanted him. That asked, ‚Äúyou want who? Are you sure?‚Äù. He laid in my lap and purred. He still has his days but he warns you when he doesn‚Äôt want to be touched but most of the time he is a great cat. It‚Äôs been almost a year and a half and he has adjusted wonderfully. 
I am super angry at OP...

To not follow up is cruelty to reddit
Guys, I've been stalking OP and this post. 

If OP comes back and they didnt get the dog but tells us the name of the shelter-- will someone go adopt this dog? 

If you start a GoFundMe of you holding THIS DOG- I will donate to it!!
For gods sake I hope SOMEONE adopted this pupper

My wife does adoptions every Saturday. I don‚Äôt know how we only have 3 dogs.
Sooo wtf? Did you adopt this dog or just try to get karma? C‚Äômon OP. 
i‚Äôm saying it now - OP is a big fat phony 
Someone take that good boy please
That's a girls hand, and the band around her wrist is a pony tail to put her hair up. #caseclosed 
Obviously the OP doesn‚Äôt own the dog, they said themselves, it was hard not to let go, in other words, letting go was very easy.
Stupid allergies...
I hope to fuck the reason OP hasn't replied is because he/she/it is in the process of adopting that cutie pie and wants to post an update tomorrow to reap all the sweet karma! 
Wait.. if its hard NOT to let go, then that would make it easy to let go. I think you meant hard to let go? This title really confuses me for some reason.
can people stop with the adopt don‚Äôt shop bullshit? all animals need homes
I‚Äôm dying. üò≠
[deleted]
Plz take that dog home with you, you must !
Wow this is sad.
Adopt! Don't have a kid! As long as you're responsible with the dog. Do whatever you want. But if you do buy a puppy, take care of it all of his life. Buy it from a responsible breeder, not a puppy mill. 
Looks like he would be a great dog for someone!! 
Come on OP. We need answers!
You went back to get him though... Right!? 
I‚Äôve always adopted! Guys their the best please if you can do you‚Äôd be surprised how many pure bred dogs there are out there..
RemindMe! 24 hours
If this shit happened to me I‚Äôd just be like fuck..guess i got a dog now
You took him right?????
So... you didn't adopt then.
Now tis just a cycle of people stalking OP and asking if they adopt the dog and collect karma
My dog did this to us at the animal shelter. She is a lab,  and we didn't want a large dog, but we couldn't resist her. 15 years later,  she's brought us so much love and is just the best! 
This is why I don‚Äôt go to the dog shelter. I‚Äôd come home with a new dog every time. 
Shop or adopt, just don‚Äôt be an asshole.
Geez.... That dog deserves an Oscar for that performance. Did you see that face ? I would have bought him a brand new truck, with all the bells and whistles, if that dog looked at me like that. Damn.... 

Would have felt guiltier than a MF, man. I sincerely hope he gets a new home. Same applies to all those other homeless pups, young or old.

Why adopt when you can foster I did it for years. you get o help more dogs and keep the best one for yourself. 
Hopefully someone can track this dog or give us update if he got adopted. Seriously...I‚Äôve never experienced such joy and anxiety at the same time...
Can you at least tell us where you're near so someone can go get this pup?
Oh my heart!
Well? Did the poster adopt?!!!! 
Barc in Houston 
How are you going to tell us ADOPT NOT SHOP when it seems pretty clear you ended up not getting this dog? If you did then you need to show us.. otherwise you're a karma farming BIOTCH who at least needs to let us know where this dog is so someone can possibly go and get this dog!!
I have a better idea.

Adopt *and* shop. 

There is nothing wrong with getting a puppy from a responsible breeder. 

I will most definitely adopt a doggo one day when my life is more settled, but if there‚Äôs a specific breed I want not available to adopt, then I‚Äôll find a breeder.

Ease up on the virtue signaling and don‚Äôt contribute to the stigmatization of buying pets from responsible breeders. 
Op you were chosen
I get the adopt don‚Äôt shop mentality, but I‚Äôm not sure why we are bias to do dogs who were bred? Are they not as worthy as dogs? Do they also not deserve loving homes? 
‚ÄúSo hard to not let go?‚Äù  

It was hard for you to hold the hand?
So cuteeeeer
I adopted a dog about 3 months ago and after seeing this post I had to go bring him back inside after letting him out from his morning romp in the backyard to hug and tell him hes a good boy :')
I would have happily adopted... If anywhere would have let me. Apparently first time dog owners aren't allowed, so we were forced to buy.
