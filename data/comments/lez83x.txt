Wow, that's so awesome of you. Having parents that appreciate your creativity is one of the best things you can have growing up. Super rad.
She spent hours making little piece from scratch. I can’t wait to eat it!
The ball even looks a little deflated in honor of Tom Brady. Nice detail. Great job!
I am a grown ass man and I have attempted to make a cake once. Shit isn’t easy. This is a lot better than I’ll ever be able to do. Awesome job.
*the National Football League would like to know your location*
This is a really decent looking cake! I need to know, is it covered in a sort of hard chocolate shell like like an Entenmanns donut? Because it looks like it is and I’m soooo down to taste a cake like that.
My first cake was with my sister as a surprise for my mom for when she got home that night after bowling. We forgot the eggs so half way cooked we pulled it out of the oven when we remembered, beat the eggs in and put it back in the oven. Yes, we gave it to mom.
You should totally post this on r/baking !!! This looks awesome, if this is her baking and decorating at 11 I cant imagine how good itll be with more time!
If I really put my would into making a cake would I probably reach 20% of how good this one looks...

Well freaking done to your 11 year old! The crazy swede whole heartedly love how well made this cake is and I would if you lived close enough buy a cake from him to when my birthday is. Sadly doesn't I think that it is a good idea to send a cake from one side of the Atlantic to the other...
what the hell she did a fucking great job??? i am 31 and have been doing art my whole life i could not make something even half this great. get this kid into culinary school
r/FondantHate lol
It's a million times better than KC's game so far.
Teach her not to use fondant, it's fucking gross
Man great job! How’s it taste ?
I am 32 years old and I can't ice a cake to save my life. The last time I tried the fondant ended up tearing and I served up a cake with more rips and patches than Frankenstein's Monster, your 11 year old is awesome x
They’re 11???? This looks like my work at 18
Looks fantastic... Now teach her about buttercream frosting.  It won't look as good but good lord, it will taste amazing :-D
Amazing! That’s really good kid!
I can’t even spell cheif
She even deflated the football looool
it’s a cool cake and all but why this subreddit? it’s not cute but very impressive for that age. this sub is more for cute pics of animals
This is awesome 👌
definitely overpaid
An eleven year made fondant icing? lol
Mmmmm brown
Please get her baking lessons - this is amazing and if she’s properly trained she can do amazing things!!!
That's better quality than I've seen from actual professionals.  I'm really impressed that an 11 year old could pull that off.
She did a phenomenal job. That said, $50 is a hefty payday for a cake.
the fondant work is awesome (daughter works for a fondant manufacturer ) her exact words!
Damn your 11-yr-old has some baking skills 🤤🤤🤤
For a first attempt this is actually really good
If she keeps this up she has a bright future with a good career, I can only imagine her wedding cakes at age 15!
Better save up for culinary school and business courses to help get their bakery going
You paid your own child $50?  I can't fathom my father ever paying me as a kid to cook or bake.  It was my duty at 11 to do those things and in return he provided a roof over my head and clothes on my back. Times have definitely changed.
Money well spent!
[removed]
I’d ask for a refund. Nobody ate it.
Soup



Bowl
[removed]
The laces are In, and the ball looks deflated. Clever girl.
If that's chocolate mud cake and she made it from scratch. I'd pay that.
Gotta start somewhere, good on you not paying in “exposure”
That's AMAZING... And she's 11!? Tip her. She did good.  🏆
Better looking than what I’d come up with! Looks good
She’s $50 richer!!! 🖤🖤
Great job!
her handwriting with icing is better than mine in general
So what are we talking here? Vanilla cake? Chocolate?
A lot better than what i can bake and looks good
She did GREAT!
Deflated ball
if there’s two comments by me sorry my reddit isn’t working right now
Cheers to you for giving her her time to shine and prove herself as an artist and chef! I love seeing this kind of support from parents
❤️❤️❤️
Way better than anything most adults would make! It's almost a shame you have to eat it.
This is really good. Sure there's room for improvement, but if this is her first try, she's going to be AMAZING some day.
I hope that football is just entirely buttercream.
You better tip
I mean it’s better then what I can do and I’m 40.
I'm a grown ass man and she did better than I could hope to.
You're a good parent
I can't even get my 14yo to do his virtual classwork, and your 11yo is out there knockin it outta the park!  Impressive motivation.
She did a fantastic job!
I worked in a bakery for years as a cake decorator and her handwriting with icing is already better than half of my coworkers. She did great!
50$ to an 11 year old? Well now, aren't you wealthy
She did better than Mahomes did today.
This doesn’t even look recognizable without all the yellow flags
Give 100 dollars because of the superb job.
This is better than anything I could have done
Laces out!
That is pretty dope dude
All the awards for such an amazing job!
I am very proud of your kid but I gotta say r/fondanthate sorry man
As a professional cake decorator, take my word that this is natural talent! Fantastic work, you should be so proud!!
You for real should continue to encourage that skill, because that fondant work is incredible for an 11 year old. Like, I've met professional bakers that can't work with fondant at all and those are clean lines for a kid.
what do you mean, "attempt"? That's a success!
Bruh I'd pay $50 for my 11 year old to bake that. If I had $50... And an 11 year old.
i thought I was an alright baker, until i realized that 11 year olds can easily out do me. well done!
Damn $50 dollars to an eleven year old is like 10k to an adult. No wonder they did such a amazing job.
I can’t believe you scammed an 11 year old out of a $3000 cake. 🤦
She's talented!
Nice job 👍🏻
I know nothing about cakes, but this is legitimately as good of a job, or better, than a grocery store bakery does, and your kiddo probably didn't have access to any of the specialty equipment they use. Aside from that, the piping job on the bottom is top notch. Just a fantastic job all around!
Even more difficult. Ganache is equal parts melted chocolate and heavy cream blended together. Great way of covering a cake. If she went the fondant route, that's even harder. Good job for her! Hope she keeps it up.
My girlfriend and I are in love with it! Tell her to be proud of herself!!
Looks Great! Except she misspelled SuperbOwl
No you made this don’t lie.
I love that cake  ! Good job !
Your 11 year old bakes better than I do at 37 👏👏👏
Super job!!
I'd eat the cake.

How was the cake?
That is definitely better than 80% of 12+ year olds.

Edit: Sorry it’s just F*ing Awesome!!!
Heck, I'm 34 and can't do any better than that
I'm 29 and that's better than I could do.
I’d pay $50 for that cake and I don’t even watch football. Good job to your kiddo!
Those of you saying it's not worth what he paid need to fuck off. The kid's 11 and the cake well exceeds expectations. $50 is a small price to pay if it nurtures a kid's passion for something. I'd like to see the projects some of you pricks were able to throw together when you were in 6th grade. Grow tf up.

Dope cake, OP.
I was a cake decorator for eight years. I say your child has talent!
That’s actually pretty neat and a genius way to teach the kid about working (something I wish I had grasped sooner), incredible, you must let them know how well they did
Even had the deflated football for Tom Brady!! Brilliant attention to detail!
You have something special, also you're a great parent for giving her that opportunity
Wow. I love it! Not sure I could that at my age... (in my 20s) It’s amazing that you’re incentivizing her to do something that she’s good at; really great to show kids that creativity can pay off and inspire that entrepreneurial spirit!
Impressive!
I hope you got the refund without any issues, hate it when unqualified people charge money for shit like this!
I'm 33 and I can assuredly say that cake is way better then what I could've done.
That’s really impressive actually. There seems to be a lot of attention to detail
She did a grate jobe for being 11
Encouraging your kid to make things with their hands is awesome! Especially baking!

And she did a great job.
But how does it taste?
When I was 11 I sure as hell couldn't make anything like that. The kid has a talent
Parents legitimately supportive of their child's interests and creative talent. Such a beautiful thing.
Please keep supporting your child's creative endeavors, they'll go so far with the support and love.
Damn, that’s a fine looking cake. Your 11 y/o has got some skill!
50 fucking dollars
I can run that field all-day
She did an awesome job! Imagine her cakes in 5 years, they’ll be amazing 🤩
Really good job 😊
You robbed her because this is gorgeous. 😭
Wow!  Beautiful cake, and what better to support than a kid's creative efforts?  Well done, both of you!!!
Omg this is actually very impressive!! Way to go!
Cultivating her interests is so wholesome. I love it!
Better than anything I could make and I am well into adulthood lol.
This is great! One of the best things you can do when a family member is starting a business (even a little one), is to buy their products at full price and provide feedback. It’s awesome of you for paying your kid and supporting their dreams. Entrepreneurs work hard for free and often at a loss for a long time before they have any success, and often their friends and family want freebies or discounts, which sucks when you’re just getting started. Way to go!
ILL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
That cake looks way too good to eat
I LOVE it! My daughter is not into baking or cooking. But, I do support her in what she enjoys doing and that is Muay Thai. The reason, she has been taking it since she was 4 years old and it teaches her self respect and how to defend herself.
Tbh that's amazing for an 11-year-olds first time
I also bake. Not professionally, but I do make my own recipes. 

She did a wonderful job!!!!

Keep up the great work!
That’s quite good. The cake fails website is an awe-inspiring look at how badly pros can screw up cakes. Kudos!
Very nice job!  That glaze is very smooth and she piped the letters and lines beautifully.
TOUCHDOWN! IT'S A WINNER!
Off to a great start! Great job! Start young and never give up...works with investing too :)
Good oo
Good job he ready lol
I remember at age 14 when I told my parents I wanted to be an artist. My dad laughed heartily in my face.
She did  great job!
Impressive! Way better than I would do!
Hm
r/shittyfoodporn
DeflateGate
1st attempt what!! I'm 28 and I still will never make one that looks like that. Good job!
Just saying, I showed up with this cake to my family/friends Super Bowl party, they’d be pumped and I’d be proud of it.

And I’m 30.
$50 is a little steep for a cake
Sell everything you own and open her up a bakery.
I’m a professional baker/cake decorator and for a first attempt, or even a 5th, that is AMAZING. She has some natural talent there with how smooth that modeling chocolate or fondant covering the cake is. 

I know things are whacky with Covid, but if she’s still interested in a few years you should look into vocational culinary high schools. I ended up being able to go a year early since I was so passionate about it. I got to do half a day at normal high school and then got bussed off to cook/bake/work in a school that was also a restaurant and bakery for the other half. Seriously changed my life
That is awesome!
Good job
Looks delicious!
**Sweet!** ^^^^^On ^^^^^several ^^^^^layers
Wow that looks awesome! :D
Omg!! This is so good!
Excellent job!!! Well done 👏👏
She did a great job!
Your 11 year old is so talented! The cake turned out great!
Very well done!!
That chocolate looks *chefs kiss* and I'm not even a chocolate fan!!
Update us when you cut into it - I’d love to see the inside!
Better than I can do! Good job kiddo!
That’s pretty good. Encourage her and watch her skills improve
It reminds me of a giant ding dong! Love it!
10/10 would order again
Worth every penny! It looks FABULOUS
I'm 37, I couldn't do anywhere near this good of a job.  $50 well spent.
That was your terrible making and your passing it off as your kids work lol
The $50 you paid her will go towards a lifetime of creativity... OP, best money you will ever spend
The cake is much better than the game!
Dude. That’s gotta be your new tradition. Just watch her improve each year.
This is genuinely impressive.
This is her first?! Wow!! 
You’ve got a cake making prodigy on your hands. The ball, the lettering and the bottom edge are so well done.
First attempt aye? Dam good for a first attempt. Hope she is proud of it.
2/10
11 years old, makes a great cake, makes $50, makes Mom proud, and makes the front page of Reddit?  
Kid's a Rock Star.
You overpaid an amateur baker to produce a masterpiece? I thought this was aww, not r/amitheasshole
Please get them baking lessons - this is amazing and if properly trained they can do amazing things!!!
It honestly looks really good! Not astounding quality obviously, but made from scratch it looks really impressive!
That cake is pro grade man !!! Good job to the little kid !!! 👍
Yeah, it’s shit.  I would ask for a full refund or at least a  coupon for a future order.... like 75% off
She did great!
I didn't know until just now who was playing in the Super Bowl.  Also, a plug for /r/Superbowl.  May not be what you think.
Looking good chef. Waaayyyy more skill than I had at twice that age.
She even deflated the football for brady
I would've paid $60
If it tastes good then she deserves a little extra. It looks amazing.
Lucky you! That's at least worth $500.
Is that a ganache?!
Looks delicious. What type of cake is it
Please post a picture of the cake after it was cut so we can see the inside! It looks delicious and personally what I like about it is that it is not over decorated to the point where it is super sugary on top.
 11 years old?! She rocked it! Looks yummy too!
If that’s a chocolate glaze, it looks so yummy. If that’s fondant, I do not see a wrinkle or crack in sight. Props to her!
I've seen way worse cakes for way more money.
Worth every penny.
I can't believe that an 11 year old made such a beautiful cake on their first attempt. Keep on encouraging them
What an awesome cake! Keep encouraging her and you'll get to eat delicious cake all the time (:
Your 11 yo is more talented than me. Good for her 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
11 I couldn’t do that at 28 😂 great job
She did great!
Making money off of a Super Bowl cake? Someone’s getting a visit from the NFL legal team....

But in all seriousness, very well done.  Much better than I could ever manage.
Good buy
Great job!
Okay really is this really fitting for the subreddit. It’s a cake.
Her icing handwriting is better than my regular handwriting, and I’m a whole ass adult
11y/o me can't even bake a small cupcake. She deserves a lot of praise.
When I was 11 all I had was an Easy Bake Oven.
This is awesome, especially for an 11 year old. Excellent work!
I'm 38. Better than I could ever do!  Tell her little one Reddit said good work!
Home made goal posts not that cheap store bought junk.
This is so good 😭
That’s really awesome.
No lie, your kid is actually talented.
That's a great cake! Tell her she did a fantastic job!
Holy shit! Feed that passion. That's an incredible job for an 11 year-old!
My 11yo daughter has a few delicious, go to recipes she likes to make for the fam.  Good times.
She's got potential!!!
That piping looks great!
Amazing!!
Appropriate that the deflated looking football is pointed towards the Bucks.

Great looking cake!
Hey you're an awesome parent. Keep pushing your kid to follow this dream.
Pretty darn good!
This is really great, especially for her only being 11. At 11 there’s no way i’d be able to do anything even close to this.
Superbowl it to THE GROUND!
At 11 I was happy to make Kraft Mac and Cheese
That looks great!
It looks so yummy!  Nice job young one- You’re on your way!
How the hell did your kid get a cake to be so smooth?
That's cute
Wow. I’ve been baking for over ten years and this is better than what I would make. Frosting is always my weakness.
Dude. Your kid needs to start a side hustle. My adult friend started baking for a pandemic side hustle and is now busy with orders.
thats amazing!! keep encouraging her, she’s going places!
Wow! That is excellent. She will probably end up making some pretty badass cakes if this is one of her firsts
Thats more that an attempt,I think its awsome,great job
Idk, that ball looks a little deflated
 My 32 YO self would have given you a Joe Louis with icing and sprinkles.
You are fantastic parents for supporting your daughter’s amazing talent!  I love y’all ❤️💕💕
I want to eat this
That looks so yummy! Now I want cake
Looks like they did a great job. Good for them.
I'm so curious what type of cake it is inside? It looks really great! Now I definitely want cake.
Future Pastry Chef in the making. Sign me up.
How'd it taste?
That is an AWESOME cake! Holy cow- she is only 11 and making cakes like that?! That is truly impressive. Let us know when she opens her bakery!
Looks fantastic, and good on you for supporting her. I hope she continues to respect and appreciate hard work and skill (especially her own) going forward!
Maybe give her anoter 50 if it tastes good? That cake looks really good, amazing for an 11year old. Never have to buy another expensive bday cake
Wow! So good! I have been amateurly baking most of my adult life and still get frustrated icing a cake. Super impressed!
Paul Hollywood: Perfect proove, great sponge, beautiful design, amazing flavor, and a proper bake.

Holds out hand.
This kid is going places!
Wow. I'd honestly pay her 50$ for these types of cakes for my kids parties lol
That's really good!  A lot of adults couldn't do as well (including me).
She did a damn good job
Nice that’s awesome
It looks great!
That looks like a 100 dollar cake
YOU are the best parent ever! And TBH cake looks good and delicious
She’s amazing! That’s a lot better than a lot of people I know could do!
You got a good deal, and I think you're making a fantastic investment.
She did an awesome job! Please let her know I'd hire her if I could
Amazing!!!! Love it
Actually looks really awesome for a first time! Kudos to her!
It looks amazing. So, how did it taste?
Very good!
Make sure to steal the $50 when she's sleeping, you know, to teach her about crime in america.
That is excellent.
This cake actually looks good. NICE JOB! Also, you are a good parent for supporting her!
Well done👍
That's a solid job!  I'd pay $50 to my daughter for a cake like that!  #dadoftheyear  #daughteroftheyear
For 11 years old, that's damn good!
Tell her to keep it up! She could be an amazing pastry chef one day!
Holy SHEET is that ganache!? That looks amazing!
Money well spent!
Better than what I could make
Hope your ready for that college fund to become a bakery fund cause hooooooodamn its a possibility.
What an awesome job!!!
Not bad
How it taste tho?
Nailed it
She forgot to put the refs on it. They’d want to be included. Obviously
That’s really good! I can’t do that
Chiefs

Bucks

Superbowl
My 11 year old made a pbj tonight, if that puts it in perspective. Way to go!!
I was confused for a solid 30 seconds; the football looks like a hole in the cake
Right.
This is fantastic! The fondant is very smooth, which is hard to do! From one baker to another, great job kid! I'm sure it tastes just as good as it looks :)
She’s 11?!?! That’s amazing!
Wow that’s amazing and definitely worth 50$ family or not
Your daughter's baking and decorating skills are amazing!
Yo, I've got a 12 and a 9.  They put in some effort for that!  Bravo.  They deserve the $50 👏🏽
She has a great future infront of her, with her qualities  and your support!
Game is almost over. You got a pic with a slice taken out?  I want to want it even more...
Can she make me a birthday cake ? That’s awesome
How cute!!
CURRY = OVER
That is some very smooth fondant work, and no flour streaks on a dark color. Great work!
That is awesome
She did an amazing job!
Save me a piece!!
That actually looks pretty good
Looks nice, how’s the taste?
Great job. I have definitely spent $50 on things that did not please me anywhere near as much as this cake would.
Better than anything I’ll ever make and I’m only 25.
Wow! Looks awesome! Very well done and looks delicious too.
better than the game
Omg I love it
that's impressive even for 50 bucks!
She’s wasting her time in elementary school ...
She’s good!  Really good!
Worth it
That’s impressive.   You should support me encourage this.  She has talent.  Not everyone does tbh.
I’ve NEVER gotten frosting so SMOOTH. I’d pay $100 to learn HOW.
Amazing!
We all knew it's worth $100, I hope the tip was $50. She did a great job!
Nice!!
I need to know what flavor it is.. other than that this is great!!
Good deal looks great . I miss doing cakes. My current job doesn’t have room for them . Cherish the simple things
Follow your dreams kid. 🚀
She did a great job!
[deleted]
Tell that Sweet little girl she has NATURAL TALENT and she will TAKE OFF with her gift one day!! You are truly BLESSED there Mom!
*claps*
Her cake looks way better than KC’s offense.

*duck*
This is awesome!!!!!
I dare you NFL. Ask a *child* to not bake a Superb Owl cake
I’d pay 50 bucks for that.
She did a great job and she's ready for Nailed It!
She made a nicer looking cake than i ever have, how about that....
That’s a bargain!  Nice cake!
This is so nice!!!
I love it!! How do we order one?
You are as good a parent as they come.
Looks great fondant is really hard to do
She did amazing!! It’s nice you’re giving her an outlet and supporting her!
That is an awesome looking cake! How does it taste?
Laces out
Why is there such a transactional relationship between parent and child? Your child will grow being a sociopath who hates you.
Wow!  She has a future as a professional!
Look at her. 11 years old and she already has a viable career option...
Beautiful cake!!
You are a great parent for supporting her hobbies/talents this way❤️
Another Brady deflate gate
She did wonderful.
You know what? Tel your kid to take my $50
that's pretty damn impressive for an 11 year old...  
congrats! I'm betting it tasted awesome :)  


And congrats to her for doing such a fantastic job! well done!
Is child labor legal? 🤔 awesome cake tho
Worth every penny! I can’t even dream of making a cake that nice. Love the details!
you have one talented 11 year old
Teach her to buy silver
awwwwww
Better than I could EVER do!! Tell her to keep it up and it’s way better than some cakes I’ve seen out there. I absolutely love it!!
This is awesome! It probably would have been easier to do a green fondant instead of brown so then she wouldn’t have to make a field separately but honestly, I would be happy buying this for $50
They did pretty, pretty good
Girl, I’m almost 40 and I have no clue how to bake out of the box with 3 ingredients. Love her cake!
Great job!
Is that fondant?  That is NOT easy to get smooth...  she did awesome!
Lesson number one, charge more than walmart
Dude it looks great wtf
Awesome job!  Your kiddo should be proud.
It honestly looks amazing for a first try
Wow! Looks awesome! 

I always had a hard time doing fondant on a round cake. I’m impressed!
You got a bargain.   That's a heck of a job.  Lucky dad!
For 11 years old that’s pretty great, it looks better than a lot of the cakes I’ve soon from my local supermarket lol. Tell her to keep at it!
That's actually pretty decent.
That don't look like a regulation field.
Wow she did amazing!
I have a sister who has baked cakes as a side hustle for more than 45 years now. There are lots of people who would happily pay you to bake for them. Good luck and keep baking!
This post and the general moment contains more sweetness than the cake itself
She is on her way!!
Great job!!
Fuckin A man
That's better than some cakes I've gotten from adults, holy crapola
That’s fucking amazing for an 11 year old... of a me year old
Well, it certainly looks like an 11 year old made it!!! An 11 year old genius that could teach the rest of us a thing or two about a thing or two!!! Great work, it really does look amazing, and I'm a culinary arts instructor (I said cooking, not pastry....  haters!)
Wow that’s really good
That’s sooooo good!! Tell them I said good job!!
This is so good! She’s definitely got talent!
For being 11 years old that is so impressive! I couldn't make anything close to this good.
What a great way to encourage entrepreneurship!
This is amazing! I would gladly take a bite
Tell her you forgot about gratuity, give her another $50 and tell her everyone was talking about what an amazing job she did.  I have an 11 year old (boy) into game design, creative shit needs to be super encouraged at every turn.
big question here is; how did it taste??
Keep encouraging her! It’s incredible to see what comes of these sorts of talents! My little sister made frog macrons this week. FROG MACRONS. Blows my mind honestly. I have no idea how she does it. Your kid is on a path to some amazing things!!
Money well spent
Better than i can do at 19 with a culinary background
Great job, little sister!
That's a good bake.
So when will she be taking orders?
Tell her she did great
This is awesome! Tell her to keep up the good work. Honestly, the more she bakes and creates, the better she'll get. With the right equipment she'll be able to get more creative as well
Yo Daddio, tell you kiddo she did an amazing job💙
Worth $50 easy. I’m in!
Wow, she did a great job!
She’s only 11? That’s amazing!
You must be a good parent
Dood.....
You gotta deal.
Money well spent! Solid transaction
That's really well done, professional work!
If I made this when I was 11 it would have come out with a voice and three eyes. 

Kids talented. Way to support!
Well done!!! 👏👏👏
She's only 11? Dannng she's already so great, she can only get better!
Great work for an 11 year old. The piping at the bottom is a nice touch. Very cool she or he “earned” the money for it too. Such a valuable experience.
This is fantastic for her first attempt at professional baking!
Enjoy your sweet treat 😀💙
Proud of her.
Way better than anything I could do
I’d love to know how she made the football! She’s got some amazing talent
She's really good!!
Awesome cake! You got a great deal!
Honestly better than my cooking
Fire her she only made half a football such lazy generation.
Touchdown!
✌️
This is really good for an 11 year old. I’m 15, and I still struggle to pipe icing and make it look good. Your kid has a bright future in baking!
This looks so good! Great job 11yr old, you'll do great things.
This is great.. cant help but imagine zoolander saying what is this a stadium for ants and then demands it needs to be 3 sizes bigger.
Your daughter has found her calling
Well. Time to profit off your children now!
At 11, I couldn’t make Mac & cheese out of a box.  Your daughter is amazing!
I was going to say tell them to get a new profession, then I re-read that an 11 year old did it.  Nice Job!
WAAAY better than I could do and I'm a grown assed man!
That’s better than what I could do.

The cake part I’m pretty good at.
The decorating part not so much
She delivered
Not bad.  Especially for a first attempt.  Especially for a child.  (Preteen😉🐣)🦄🐞💐
No attempt here, that’s a success!
Superb
Nice!
Parenting win! ^_^ great wait to encourage your kids passions. Turned out good, bet it tastes delicious.
Wow! Looks amazing.
Pretty solid job. Looks way better than what I can do.
That’s her first attempt?! Woah, talk about raw potential!
Ngl but that looked better than my 503th attempt.
$50! What a great parent. When I was little, I got coupons and foreign money from the tooth fairy
This is actually pretty legit. Did there thing
I think she’s got a future in baking!
This is really great!
lol $50
I’d pay her $50 for one too! Good job to her!
Better than some bakery’s where grown ups make the cake. 🤣🤣🤣
Good for you for paying her a reasonable rate even though she's just 11.
Ok but did it taste as good as it looks???? Need an update when you try it!
Good parenting
Wow. That is 10 times better than what I could do. She has a talent
Nice work
Kid's got skill! Very nice work, it looks so delicious too!
That’s incredible. Tell her a guy in ND is impressed!
I consider myself a decent baker..her designs are way better and the steadiness of that handwriting?! 

Absolutely gorgeous. Mine would have looked like dog poop instead of the football and the writing would have been 4 different sizes, with no continuity..oh and running out at the very end because I made the letters too big at the beginning..


Tell her this 31 year old woman is highly impressed, I couldn't even come close. It also looks highly delicious!
Great job? It looks delicious
It’s awesome!!
That's a great fondant cover for any starting baker, let alone an 11 year old! She should be very proud!
And it looks awesome!!
My wife made me pause the game at the coin toss, so I’m sorry if I’m late to the party...but I’ve never wanted cake more in my life.
Excellent lettering skill.
Money well spent - excellent presentation and detail.  I bet it tasted great!
This is excellent! How did she get her letters so uniform?! I’m very impressed. There’s no way I could ever do that. Well done!
I’m in my 30s. I’ve baked a lot of decorative desserts. This is better than anything I’ve ever done. Can I be her when I grow up?!
when I was about this age I got really into making cakes too, 

I loved to separate the batter into about 4-5 smaller bowls, make each bowl of batter a different color, and then pour each one at a time into the pan making tie dye cake :) ah I miss baking
I’d pay her a hunnit.  That cake turned out good!
That's far better than I could manage and I'm 34.
That's awesome! I couldn't make anything look half that good.
Psssht. That's a college football, not NFL.

I'd request a refund.
This is a genuinely impressive cake. If your kid still wants to be a baker in the future, she'll be fantastic at it.
Wow!
That’s amazing even more because they’re eleven
That looks like a pretty decent job with the fondant. It’s smooth and looks like has uniform thickness. Fondant isn’t the easiest to work with, so kudos!
Wow! I'm impressed!
That looks fantastic! I’m impressed with the penmanship and neatness. I’m a grown man that loves to bake, and this is much nicer than  anything I’ve made. Hats off, and cheers to you for being so supportive of your kiddo. Bonus parenting points.
She's got a good future ahead of her.
I could never make a cake that looks this good. She did a great job.
The only thing inedible on here is the goal posts. Everything else is legit frosting and cake, not even any fondant decorations like many "pros" do. This entire thing would be delicious, and it looks good. 10/10
You are a wonderful parent supporting her like this. I hope it tasted as good as it looked.
what? WHAT?!?  That's so freaking good!  She's ELEVEN?!? Get her in pastry school when she's old enough, mama.  She's got the chops!
She will always remember this. She's very gifted!
Better than most bakeries tbh
Money incredibly well spent.
Seriously holy hell this 11 year old has got some serious skills already. 

I see a great potential.
Perfect for cake day!
Really clean detailing on the bottom edge!!
If you look at it right, the football will create a hole in the cake
Outstanding!!!! I like to think I’m a grown ass man and I would never be able to make anything that good!
That ball looks a little deflated to me!
That cake looks excellent!
Worth.it.
Awesome job she did!
Nice work
That's freaking awesome. I feel like your kid is going to have a future in baking.
honestly?! It's smooth, and relatively complicated. I'd buy this cake.   
This is better than walmart's airbrushed stencil icing stuff, this is actually made.
Her icing on cake writing looks better than my own on paper :(
Noice
damn it that's so good
...I’m 32 and I can’t make a cake that looks anywhere near as good as that.
Socialism at its finest
[Just needs a fitting halftime show](https://youtu.be/ttUN3zgKBng)
for some reason, the thing that strikes me is how good the handwriting is lol. at least for me, trying to write in frosting is damn near impossible
That looks nothing like an owl.
Better than anything I could‘ve made when I was 11
Attempt? I'd say she nailed it!
Paid $100 for a lot worse
I hope you missed a digit! I'd  pay $150 for an 11 year old to make this!!  This is awesome!
Looks like how Chiefs played.
She put more effort into this cake then the entire Kansas City team did into trying to win the Game. Tell your kid the Internet is proud.
SuperbOwl
Wow! That is amazing. Incredible job! I'd pay for that cake any day. Great job!
That looks incredible! Much better than I’d be able to do lol. And she’s ELEVEN?!?!
Great job!
DANG she’s only eleven???
She did a wonderful job!
I Do Only Need Two Lemons If Knees Eat International Tomatoes.

Read the capital letters.
It better that what I can do and I’m 16
You guys know this dude just made this cake and wanted props so he said his kid made it, right?

I'm totally kidding, just busting balls. That's a a pretty "sweet" job she did!
This is awesome! If you'd told me it was professionally made, I would have believed you! Make sure to tell her she did a great job!
Fuck, that's pretty good for  11
That’s definitely a $50 cake. At the very least. She’s got skill.
Amazing.
That looks like an awesome cake! Great work on the text too. How did it taste?
I can already tell your kid is going to make amazing cakes
We deserve at least one crumble of that
Looks as good as the chiefs offense
I was gonna say just the fondant looking pretty well placed and smooth is better than most of us could. I think this is a lot more impressive for an 11yo's hobby than some people would think.
Yo your kid did so good, thank you for encouraging your kids to do their best and to value their work. it's very clean. Give her my congrats!
That's better than anything I've ever made! And I'm almost 30
She did a fantastic job!
Well worth it! That looks sooo good.
Dude! Way to go parent! This kids got some bakers future in them.
I'm thirty and I doubt I could do better. Bravo
If your home qualifies for a food Cottage License you could help her sell to locals — or in some states, if you pay to get your kitchen “commercial kitchen” certified, she can sell through local coffee shops and bakeries. It varies by state, but one baking lover to another, nothing beats having your goods on display in a local store!
Nice!!!!
Parenting at its finest!!
I’d you haven’t already help her embrace that creativity and enroll in classes (once it’s safe to do so of course).
Her football actually looks good. 
Already beat me.
Great now the NFL is going to sue them for not Licensing the Super Bowl name for a commercial product.
Sweet
That’s actually a really good cake. She is gonna be an amazing cake artist if she sticks with it.
When the cake is better than the game.
🎂💥😘
Awwwww she’s like a wee little Buddy Volastro
The chocolate looks so smooth is it fondant?
brilliant!
The cake looks amazing! She did such a good job. And kudos to you for supporting her interests and hobbies! You’re one awesome parent 😄
You're 11-year-old has some real talent
Really good actually. Her handwriting is way better than mine and she did it with frosting
Wow what a deal! Looks amazing!!
50 bucks? ... you stole that cake
I think you got your money’s worth. That’s a hell of a job!
I think Winners was spelled wrong but I’ll allow it
Hey, that's pretty good.
Now take it back, and tell her it's  for rent money.
F-ing nailed it!!!
$50 well spent
Awesome job!
She deserves $120 as this was my local superstores coat at a MUCH lesser cost for a Super Bowl Sunday cake
I actually feel like that's pretty good. Cakes aren't easy to make like that
DAAWWWW SO CUTE:3
Your kiddo did an amazing thing, and so did you!
Well, that is much better than I could have done. And I am in my 30s. She did a wonderful job.
Tom Brady deflated ball
She did a great job!
Did DAMN good!
They have have a good future ahead of them
I'm a lot older and I couldn't have made something half as great as that!
Wow that’s pretty impressive! :o
That looks amazing. I'm three times her age and I've baked countless cheesecakes and wouldn't have been able to pull that off. Good on you for encouraging her to learn some valuable skills at an early age, and also for being excited to try it out. I'm sure she's happy and that you're really proud.
OooOOOH money well spent that deal was in your favor :0
Looks awesome. Tell her to keep it up.
Buccaneers kicked ass
Well now I'm just embarrassed for myself
Serve me a Super Bowl of that!!
Your kid is a talented one.
...That's better than anything I could have made.
This is THE best way to support an interest! Thank you for doing this. Please continue to nurture (though I'm guessing not for 50$ a meal haha) her interest in the culinary arts!
For 11, that is incredibly well done. No one I know could get even close.
This is AWESOME.
I don't like it....on the sole purpose a 11 year old can bake better than I'd ever be able to.
Congrats on a brilliant child!
Well worth it!  Cheers!
good job my guy 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽
That’s fucking amazing
Well spent!
First off, I worked in a bakery for a year (not always decorating) but when I had to, I could never do anything half this good.  This is a great first attempt.
An 11 year old made that!?! Wow, what a talent!
Please tell me that football isn't made of pure fondant because sweet Jesus christ
Excellent cake for that age!
Not bad kid
In my 1st year in baseball when I was a kid, I new I had potential and in the season once the coach of the enemy team even after beating us (we never won a match cuz all the other kids were really bad except 1-2) He wanted me in his team and was going to put me in a School specialize in Baseball. But my Father said no it's just your 1 year in this (And I love it so much) We never won a single game in the season and guess what I did I QUIT! I HATE THAT HE DID THAT TO ME. It hurt me so much I am crying right now writing this. I could have been a great Baseball player like my body was build for that. He is a good father but that dagger is still in their man! ( I have never shared this before).
She has a very creative future ahead of her. That's a beautiful cake! You're an awesome dad!
Dude, is that coated in ganache? Former culinary school trained chef/burnout... If your 11 year old is producing a cake like that.  Ganache coated and decorated.. she is killing it. Enjoy, and I look forward to buying super high end stuff when she has her own bakery. I hope she is east cost so I have a chance to see it. Cheers from NJ.
She did MUCH better than I could! Practice makes perfect. Keep encouraging her if she remains interested. My daughter is an artist that went from “hey that’s pretty good!” at 11 to insanely good and sells her work at 16.
11? That’s awesome. Good for her.
It's better than I can do, and I'm literally triple her age.
Incredible job!!!
nice job👍👍👍👍👍
i couldnt even make a blogna sammich right at 11 yo
hell, even the chocolate layer is perfect layered🤘
Not sure if its just me, but that football looks inverted. But omg that is an amazing cake
I don't know how expensive cakes are in US but that's a good cake for 50 dollars.
That is good cake 🥰👏🏼👏🏼
That fondant is very impressive. Great job!
Great cake. At first I thought it was a dig at Brady because of deflate gate but it’s actually just a wonderful cake made by a talented kid
That’s probably better than what I can do and I’m a lot older than 11.
Worth every penny
Wow, he is very skills.  Sky is the limit kid
50 bucks well spent
Badass, you go child!
Careful soon you’ll be paying $500 if it’s a 5 star
That’s amazing for an 11 year old! Great job!!
It is awesome. What a great job👏👏👏
Genuinely much better than my 29 year old grown self could do.
Looks good to me
I’ve paid similar to a bakery and received much worse.
Promise you it will be the best $50 you ever spend.
You can see some of the thought process. "Should I put them in the football?... No I'll put them next to the football... No! I'll make a field and put them at either end. Perfect" love it
I’d pay $50 to your kid for this! Good job!
I'll be honest, your kid is about half my own age, and they're definitely even better then I am right now, and I'm not afraid to admit it. I love baking cakes, but have never been able to decorate them very well. Keep encouraging them, and well done!
Tell your daughter that we think it’s perfect and adorable 🥺also tell her that she can bake better than me at such a young age lol
11!? She’s good!!
Well crap, now i gotta buy one. I love fondant! Seriously a good cake! Well done!
$50?! What a steal!
That's better than some professional cakes I've seen.
That's really good for 11 yo, hell of I tried even I couldn't. I guess that's because I suck at cooking and baking
Awww! Beautiful!
Well down to the little chef!. That is not professional "attempt", that is pure talent...
Nice!
She certainly did a better job than me!
The texture looks like home made, so prosibly not fandant. Edible , general artistic concept , edible. Worth the money. Aww
Looks good!!
Ngl that's pretty good especially for a 1st time. Not to be rude though, did they have any help like a tutorial, parental help for things like the icing or sculpting of the little football and goal posts? If they didnt have anything helping that's actually astonishing with how amazing it looks.
holy crap she's good. thank you for being a parent that not only encourages artistic endeavors, but fosters it!
That’s excellent work for 11 years old and their first try!  Kudos :)
That's TREMENDOUS. Your kid is a rockstar. 

Please encourage her to pursue a lucrative career in literally anything else besides cooking.
Looks great!
That’s really impressive for an 11 y/o. Like, I wouldn’t pay $50 for that cake, but if my $50 cake cake out like that, I wouldn’t be angry enough to send it back
Are you sure this is only the first attempt? It looks great
Wow! I’m a fondant hater but she did a great job!
Good parent.
This is a surprisingly good cake
That’s pretty awesome looking! I’d be excited to cut into it. Good for you for encouraging her and good for her! She should be proud.
Why have you taught your daughter fondant??
r/confusingperspective 

Is it convex or concave in the middle?
That's awesome! my parents always let me try things like this when I was a kid, and I'm forever grateful for that and it looks like you're doing the same to your kid, props to you!
Ngl that’s actually an awesome looking cake
That's actually really good for an 11-year-old! Kid's got a future.
Awesome fondant work!!! So impressed
I am a 27yr old adult woman whose parents own a bakery and this is better than I’ve done or could do.
Do u think your son could teach me.
r/toptalent
Wow that's better than I could do. Although that might not be a very high bar hahaha
This isn’t even cute it’s just impressive!
11? I can’t even do that. Wow!
I support this! I would buy one!
I dont know about you, but I see a damn good looking superbowl cake. $50 is a steal.
Of course she did..
Holy crap
You definitely got your money's worth!
That is way better than I could do. Go kid!!
She earned every penny. Good on ya’
You’re a magnificent parent, keep doing what you’re doing.
At only 11 years old that’s damn impressive. Keep nourishing that talent!
Unless that tastes like card board you took advantage!
Rip what a waste of 50 bucks that's an awful attempt keep trying noob
Great job!!
Tell him to start a bakery
That's awesome! She did a good job!
Thats pretty good tho. I’d buy it. Not for 50$ but i’d buy it
I hate to be "that guy" but I really hope OP was just enjoying this cake with their household, and NOT hosting a superbowl party for friends and fam.
No offense, but why is professional in parentheses. Technically anything is done professional as long as it's done for pay.
Hey, you're an awesome parent!

Once it's safe to do so, please inquire about some professional baking classes you could maybe sign her up for, or maybe do a  parent / daughter thing with.
You know what that's amazing for a first attempt. Nurture and encourage this wonderful skill! Tell your kid that they did amazing and we can't wait to see more!
This is incredible!!!!
I have to say, that looks like $50 of effort from then hands of an 11 yr old.  Very nice!
That’s an amazing cake for an 11 year old
That's amazing!  I'm going on 33 and the only thing I ever did with fondant was cupcake toppers, not cover the whole thing.
Professional cook here.  Not a prayer I could do it better!!  11 yr old has focus and dedication!
I’d pay for that for sure! I’m glad you are supporting her in a way that’ll motivate her (because it instills confidence, not just because of the money). It’s hard to find safe ways for kids to earn money now, so maybe her baking can take off!
This is better than some cakes you can buy from actual so-called “professionals”. Good on her!
An 11 year old did that!?  That's insane!  If you see this comment, please tell him/her that they did an amazing job!!
I've never even learned piping yet. That's nuts.
That's actually pretty good
At eleven... or even 30 my handwriting wouldn’t even come close to looking that good. Way to go baker!
I bet people have paid $50 for shittier looking cakes.
What an awesome cake! You are an amazing mama!
That's only maybe a 15 dollar cake. You should get your money back
Well compensated it looks great
That's so cool and looks amazing!
Looks like your child may have a bright future ahead of them.
She did an awesome job. I'm sure thatd a memory she'll have for a lifetime
When I was eleven I could barely make toast. Impressive!
If there wasn't help, this is very impressive. My daughter is 11 and wants to be a pastry chef or candy maker. I should show her this.
Most Popular is an unusual way to get the scouts' attention. The scholarship offers will come pouring in soon. Seriously this is amazing.
I used to work in a bakery. We had pro cake decorators who had classes for this stuff who would have struggled to make this. Good work!
Objectively great deal and worth 50 bucks
I pay my girl’s to bake for friends and biz clients too! Way to go!!
That’s pretty good for an 11 year old!
That’s awesome!
That's damn impressive I'd pay money for that if I actually ate cake
That’s the best cake I’ve ever seen bruh tf
It’s honestly pretty good. Better than I could bake, props to you for supporting her creativity
As someone who has worked in a kitchen before, you get better with time. Tell her she did a good job!
That’s amazing! She really is talented. And you’re a great parent for giving her that responsibly then praising her for her work.
Wow that's actually really nice!
Looks good 👍🏻
A cake picture with not everyone being grossed out by fondant, suprising!
This is literally 1000% better than any cake I (28M) could make or really even conceive of
I'm 39, and his skills is already light years beyond mine! 👍🏾
In all honesty its not bad. Id love to try the piece of cake
Damn, 11?! I’m still using finger paint, and you aren’t supposed to eat that on a cake. If ever.
Thanks awesome work!
Ill take two!
Well I mean she did what you asked
That’s such a professional looking cake!! No joke!!
Chocolate and not fondant?! She’ll do well.
Actually not that bad
Looks great...how'd it taste?
Wow!  I see a career for her as a baker!  That’s amazing!!!
You know what, this is really good. If she didn't use eggs (did she?), I'd probably have it for a party (If I had one).
Impressive
