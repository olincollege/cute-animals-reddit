Puppy all night and pay the price. 
The countdown to zoomies has begun. 
"I did this." 
When you are the designated driver.
"Man, somebody toilet-puppied my yard."
Great title 
10/10
That caption!
Mom relishing the temporary stillness.
Bonestown massacre 
They might get a ticket for that litter
Furry jellybeans.
These aren't mine....are they? 
I wish my yard had puppers in it 
Who spilled puppies all over the goddamn place?!
“You guys are never allowed to stay home alone again” 
Your puppy garden seems to be doing very well
Mom's pissed
I want to come to your parties
/r/titleporn
Next on, I Didn’t  Know I was Pregnant...
I told you kids NO PARTIES!!! when we are gone. You Never Listen!
THIS PICTURE IS SO LOVELY
I’d pick up that litter any day!
That word play alone gets my upvote.
I can't begin to tell you the hours I've put into locating my car.

I've got to the point where I get 2-3 friends and offer $100 whomever finds it.

It beats the $300 fee to get it out of the city pound.
"How long was I out for?"   


"About 9 months"
Haha, too cute 😊😊😊
I’m never drinking again. 
That was a good pun made me chuckle. Also, that's super cute. 
They need to water the puppy plants, They're looking a bit droopy.
Who let the dogs out?
Mom is like, rookies smh
I’d absolutely have to zerbert every single one of those fat little tummies.
I want to Rock n Roll all night and puppy every day

It's an emergency, I need to pet them or I'm going to die, don't question, there's no time
When it's time to puppy we will puppy hard
DURDURDURDURDURDURDURDURDURDURDURDURDURDUR
A++ title, you deserve a treat
After a great party, your guests just pass out wherever they are, those puppies are so adorable!
Where the f*ck I left my flip flops
Look at these party animals, all passed out on the lawn. I'm sure they ate whatever they could get their paws on and then peed on the floor.
My good girl wants to puppy all the time, puppy all the time, puppy all the tiiiiimmme
The most adorable hangover 
Those bigger plants in the bottom left and just right to that bottom walk rock are crab grass (I think, tough to tell without seeing closer because they do look similar to st Augustine grass from afar). Confirm it and pull them and spray or they’ll over take that beautiful St. Augustine the pups would love so much more! The pups will half destroy the Augustine still but do what you can! Augustine is so amazing when it has its room to breathe. Crab grass is one of its ultimate enemies and overtakes very easily with its size.

Sorry. I just got my first home a while back and I’m addicted to lawn care. It’s relaxing.

But anyway, beautiful dogs. Love them because they love you. Great picture <3
This made me laugh!! 😍❤️😂
I’d clean that mess up np. I’d just have a litter of puppers at my house. 
I can proudly say I’ve never partied so hard I woke up to kids.
I want to have parties like this. How do I have parties like this?
the parents like "I raised them so well..."
A+ title
Can i have one?
Looks more to me like Anakin Dog Walker just finished visiting pup lings at the Jedi Temple. 
Russian officer looks at dead conscripts after the battle of Stalingrad. 1943, colorized.

Thank you for the gold, anonymous Redditor!
When you partied too hard and woke up to find you have kids now. 
Golly 😍
Suddenly I’m a sanitation engineer give me the address ASAP 
You mean pawtied!!!! 
Does anyone go on this subreddit and wish they can pet every single one of these puppers? Because I do all the time and I am especially right now
That is a GREAT caption
do dogs like to sleep in the grass 
Ayy lmao
Someone spilled their puppies all over her lawn
/r/PeopleFuckingDying 
That's too adorable, you're going to kill me with overwhelming cuteness...I...can't...handle...that..amount..of.. cuteness!
If you look really closely, they seem to have assumed a rough huffsky formation. 
When you’re the first one up at a sleepover
"Hey guys I'm ready to play again.   Anybody??"
"Dude, that's my flannel, not a blanket, give it!"
Mom: I'm not mad I'm disappointed
Don’t drink the Flavor-Aid!
Came for the puppies, upvoted for the excellent pun.  
r/partydog
Sleepy pups.
Unintended consequences. 
Lol wasted 
*starts up lawnmower*
The thumbnail looks like a guy wearing a green sports jersey and cap and holding a green dinosaur doll. 
I always clean up while still drunk, it’s more fun than waking up feeling like shit and having to clean
Well they are all here. Just don't wake up for ten more mins please.
I thought it was laundry in the yard that he was messing with lol
My heart just exploded 😍
You need a pupper scooper 
Nice little joke there
someone littered the litter
They hit the peanut butter hard 
Salt n’ Puppers
Pun points
Better get inside, it's raining dogs and, ummmm, dogs.
I bet the grass is more comfortable than concrete on a light little puppy body.
Gotta rock this house until we knock it down
I thought those were dead cats at first
"Why did I do this"
Puppies and huskies are literally the best things in this world like ever 
puppy.exe has stopped working
Pawtied
Pup on lower right... Is he striped???
Photoshop a keg
Hey OP. It looks like your plant needs fertilizer. 
It looks like last week. 
Kids, they just don't learn!
... and what *a mess*... 
How hard did you party?!
I don't know why, but when I first saw this, I thought those were dead rabbits or something.
Litterally
I would just move.
Thank you for this, I very much needed it today!
Oh no OP someone littered your house with mini hot dogs! 
I like the word play. 
Don’t you just hate it when people litter?
Your potat farm is coming along well. 
Wow I have never seen before very very nice 
When there can be only one good boye 
It's like the dog version of a Canadian Indian reservation.
This would we a pretty good r/puns
This post is so cute lol I want to lie in the grass with them
There's even a puppy shaped dirt spot! 
r/Punny

Cats have this all worked out.

They use a litter box.
"master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do?"

Came in through the dog door,
Pups are in the front yard,
And you’re gone
That rubbish looks like dogs
"wtf where did these puppies come from. I think I have a problem." 
Sleep tight, puppers! 
The left-most puppy looks like a puppy statue that fell over i love it
never put twinkies on your pizza
How come we never see a pic of adult dogs (or any animal) with thier more adult parents? It's always adult dog parents with baby dog.

Is it because baby dogs get separated from thier parents almost %100 of time? They're ok with separating parent and child because no one wants to or is able to raise a large dog family with like 8 members?
The temple? Oh no. The temple... It was so good. I didn't meant to. I want to. I meant to. I didn't mean to. 
I hate these cute weeds. I dunno what to do with them.
Nice
Pups drank too much and are now in a milk coma.
That's a clean up I can dive right into boss!

Edit, stupid fingers
“Awwww bro I ate so much moist and meaty chow last night”
Thailand? Or somewhere in Southeast Asia 
Cant believe he killed em all. Good dog!
Clean up the litter, I get it!
My kinda party!
