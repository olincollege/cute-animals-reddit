Cool video and all, major props to the cat and his adorable teefies,however, I have studied the insides of numerous Pringles cans, and as a professional fatass, can wholly report that is NOT a Pringles can and do not enjoy being lied to, good sir!
Rare footage of me scrounging the refrigerator at 1 am

Someone get Bo Burnham in here, we got someone to get his pringles.
If I were a very smol creature, I would find this terrifying.

Can this not be reposted for one goddamn second
saw this few days ago with sound. it was better.
Barely waited a day to repost.
When you see those tiny top cat teeth
Hilarious!
This made me genuinely smile and say aww
This has been reposted so. Many. Times. In the past week 😤
At the beginning the light in the back looks like a nipple
Only seen this 2,820 times
This cat reminded me of Gmork from The Neverending Story.

If I put out my finger my cat will ALWAYS sniff it. I try this with other cats and I'm usually left there holding a finger while a cat looks at me like I'm an asshole.

Thanks for always being down for a sniff Minnie
I fuckin hate Reddit. Stop reposting shit you asshole
Wow, that’s a lot of rewards for an inferior repost after 5 days.
You should’ve kept it going so you could have a ‘YOU DIED’ or Skyrim starting meme

Great vid!
he looks like a little bat!
I can't fit my hand inside a Pringle can. I have a huge amount of trouble fitting my hand inside of a Pringle can. I can get my hand like four inches into the can, but then I have to tilt the can into my mouth, but then a bunch of crumbs have accumulated at the bottom of the can, so they all go spilling onto my face. What I'm trying to say is the diameter of Pringle cans is way too small.
Need someone to edit this so when cat finally covers whole video, it fades into skyrim
Cute video! Don’t mean to rain on anyone’s parade BUT, leaving stuff like this out can be very dangerous. A friend of mine left a Pringle can on the table and his chihuahua’s head got stuck in it. Sadly he suffocated :(
This is my sleep paralysis demon's pet cat.

Why do reposters never upload the best version of a post? The original from like a day or two ago had sound, and it made it 1000x better.
And when I repost everybody hates me 😅
Idk why I just laughed so hard.
That ain’t no Pringle’s can.

FUCKING SHIT, I had this in bookmarks because I thought it was funny but I was looking for another post, and put my phone down to reposition in bed and when I brought my phone to my half asleep face, I saw the cats face staring into my soul. Thanks.

This cat's head is like the perfect size for a Pringles can. Maybe I should get a cat, because I can't fit my hand inside a Pringle can.
I have a huge amount of trouble fitting my hand inside of a Pringle can. I can get my hand like four inches into the can, but then I have to tilt the can into my mouth. But then a bunch of crumbs have accumulated at the bottom of the can, so they all go spilling onto my face.

You didn’t even wait 5 days to repost [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/fb1j2a/oh_lawd_he_comin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)?

Also do you know what a Pringles can looks like
Looks like morty
Glorious. Thank u OP 🙌🏼
How do you misspell misleading thumbnails?
I honestly didn't know how small cats teeth were
This cat looks like the terrifying Wolf from the Never Ending Story.
So that's what my coke sees
Cat must know your location. Location: Pringle’s can.
Is it me or this looks animated lol
That gets waaaaay too close to be comfortable watching for me
Me: this is so cute. No wait, it's terrifying.
God bless you for posting this
That's what the chips at the bottom of the can see when I'm trying to get them out
Aawws
Before the cat shows up, it looks like something inappropriate...
This needs the “you died” at the end
Every video like this awakens a primal fear in me, I swear.
The real question is why did I watch this three times
It's... The Gmork!
repost.....
You take really good care of your  cat's gums and teeth. Good job!
I was low-key terrified. A cat has never seemed more feral to me.
"You died"
Ceiling looks like a nipple
Awww but also this could be a boss fight
It looks like claymation
I missed the AWW part.

more like /r/interestingasfuck
Lol,
cat: "whats dis in here...."
Can we get a "you died" over this?
So the flys were recording or you just decided to stick a camera in a Pringle’s can because... why the hell not??
Awwwdly terrifying.

u/redditspeedbot 2x
uh my cat looks identical to this?
Them damn inter dimensional cats
Ommmggg I can’t handle this it’s too cute
How did you record this?
Seen this before but with sound. It's 1000x better with sound.
ENHANCE
I want a video of [wilfred](https://youtu.be/Q8i2WPxXxS4) doing this
Gmork is hungry.
You cut off the part where he licks the lense. It's such a satisfying ending.
I just want to boop that nose!!
What the last chip sees before being devoured
Looks like a kitten to me. ฅ(ﾐ・ﻌ・ﾐ)ฅ
If you were a mouse then this would be the scariest thing you’d ever seen
Obligatory “aw lawd, she comin!” comment
Link to the version with audio?
Why is there a camera in the Pringle can?
"I smell tatos!"
I love the way that a kitty's little nose twitches when they're sniffin something good. So cute.

This also looks startlingly like my cat, which also increases my enjoyment.
This is terrifying
Actually kinda terrifying
Did anyone else think the gif started with the cats eye?
Terrifying.
The video with sound is even better, i would link it but my friend sent me in downloadable form and i don't want to repost
REPOST
Every time I see this, I think I’m looking at very pregnant woman’s belly.
Kinda terrifying
The last thing you see before you die
Those teefies!!
Rare footage of me searching who tf asked
This is terrifying! Who are cat people???
Aw

This was a jab at that fact.
YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL EYES
This gave me anxiety
This made me laugh out loud. Thanks!
I have had my fair share of Pringles and can tell you this is not the inside of a Pringles can. I am disappointed OP
Cats are cute and all but I fail to see the aww in this.
#😳
Hi
H a y a t o
The teefs in their full glory
Look at those little toofers :3
* contorted breathing in can
I'm scared
That cat has seen the end of days.
simultaneously cute and scary.
I 👏 NEED 👏 SOUND 👏
"i am the MORK, that follows THE NOTHING!"
You 
Died
This could probably also be r/wtf.
It just reminds me of the jeeper creeper scene. Yes, I am old.
I wouldn't say it's /r/awww material.  Definitely scary as hell to me.
Needs sound
I feel like a mouse being cornered.
Father. I crave crunchs.
Clever girl
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day
reposted smh
Its tiny teeth. <3
Me after seeing that there is 1 more pringle in the can
r/oddlyterrifying

Must. Boop. The. Snoot.
Those teeth!
Look at the teefies!!!!!
y o u  d i e d
Please cross post to /r creepy
I remember something when i saw this cute cat face
Cat instantly made me think of Michael Jackson's Thriller.
The sound version is better.
So this is what a mouse feels like.... no, no. no... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
This has been reposted so many times. WTF.
Aaaaaaaahhhhh make it stop. Why does this vid make me so uncomfortable? lol
Disappointed the cat didn't try to FIT IN the can.
***You died!***
Thriller NIGHT
Nice!!
lol
How do you keep your butt open so wide???
Your coochies POV
Definitely not a pringles can
Why does your cat look like Michael Jackson as a werewolf?
Cute but creepy.
OBJECTION! This testimony is false! That's clearly NOT a pringles can!
jeepers creepers vibes
Werewolf!!!!!
Gave off Jeepers Creepers vibe
The audio makes this video 100x better
That is so cute ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I just wish I could hear the sniffs!
Its so much better with sound.
Please, I need more. I can almost SMELL THE TEEFIES. PLS
Can someone link the other gif where it's the same angle and the cats trying to claw at the camera? I can't find it anywhere..
*Breathing intensifies*
This was more disturbing than Aww lmao.
Soooo cute! <3
Cats are fucking great because just like humans they try to look all respectable in public but are total derps when they don't think anyone is looking.
What Jerry saw while hiding in his hole.

How many times is this going to be reposted this week?
Is this true
u/vredditdownloader
Probably a paper towel roll with catnip at bottom
Why the hell is your camera in the Pringle’s can?
Isn’t this just the one scene on the bus from Jeepers Creepers 2?
You Died
Hi, Yellowfang!
This looks like a scene out of Fantastic Mr. Fox.

Therefore it must be a sequel? 

Miss. Calamitous Cat
I booped my screen when the cat’s nose filled it
This is way better with sound
Nightmare fuel
I feel threatened
YOU DIED
Cat's are so cool...
OMG those little teeth!
Who else booped the cat at the end
u/vredditdownloader
Oh lawd he/she comin
r/oddlyterrifying
The version with sound is way better. But I don't have a link.
