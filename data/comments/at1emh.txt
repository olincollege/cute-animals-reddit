This is an older dog with severe arthritis if I recall. Water therapy feels heavenly since it's almost zero pressure on the joints and allows them to relax and move a little almost pain free.
I would love for that to be the case but this is water therapy. It helps with joint pains and is a good way to retrain a dog after it has been sick and unable to move. This dog is probably the most comfortable it has been in awhile

Good buoy
Be a strange dog that needs to learn to swim. They float well and have webbed feet.

Good to see him enjoying it though. Looks well chilled 
The calm we all aspire to.
We really hope our boy doesn't work this out somehow, he has weekly hydrotherapy and if he starts doing this we've got a problem.

Me floating over my life goals.
I‚Äôm pretty sure that this is from a video about a dog with severe arthritis. His owner learned that swimming, or floating, relieved the pain. So, he‚Äôd carry him to the pool or to a nearby lake. 
"come on boy, you can do it!"      
"Shut up Karen, I am doing it."

Who's a good boy! (fuckin love huskys) 
I thought dogs knew how to swim by instincts.
r/StoppedWorking
The cool thing is that dogs are physically incapable of urinating while submerged in water.  They have three bladders and the urethral canal contracts when they go swimming to prevent water/fish/parasites from getting up there and infecting their bladders or balls. 

 I'm a veterinarian and I took an oath to never lie on the internet, or make up facts about dogs.
You want to teach him/her to swim, don‚Äôt give them a life jacket. They‚Äôll swim...for a bit, then crawl to shore.
OP you're  a lying asshole
Obviously the dog is actually dog-swimming as fast as the frames per second, making it seem like it is just floating
Lazy doggoüòç
Deal with it
I do what I want sucka
Funny stuff . But seriously folks - dogs don‚Äôt need to learn to swim . They dog paddle by instinct. So the OP was a funny lie . 
Who puts a life jacket on a dog? They instinctively know how to swim. 
You usually see dogs paddle when they think they're in water.

This dog is actually in water and isn't paddling.

Dog is broken.
Learn how to swim? That‚Äôs an instinct for dogs. Never seen one that can‚Äôt. 
Looks like he learned to me
One smart dog- living the good life!
Awww I love malamutes. 
I will also do the same if learning doesn't work:D
he already mastered the art of floating. look at him. not even moving that beautiful paws
He found the cheat code, no effort, and maximum relaxation. 
Get him a neck pillow right now! 
Good for his arthritis, poor dude ‚ù§Ô∏è
He knows what life is about.
Plot twist: he already knows how to swim...
Since when do dogs need to learn to swim? 
If he wasn't terrified of bodies of water larger than the size of his water bowl, I could definitely see my parents' Malamute doing this. 

"Oh you want me to do this? Nah I don't feel like it. Whatcha going to do about it?"
Hey I do that too
"You think this is funny Susan?" 
Guessing he's immobilized by the vest?
That Lazy-Boi sure looks comfortable
I envy him!
This is such a husky thing .... lolol they legit will do what they want when they want .
Where is his F'in margarita? 
That‚Äôs the face of a dog that desperately needs to know why you did this to him. 
...is...is...is this my spirit animal?

Good example on how comfort zone makes ‚Äúdog‚Äù lazzzzyyyyyy. I wonder now that he‚Äôs used to the floating vest, if you remove it, will he continue stay still.. (you never know until you try)
r/meirl    
On a side note, I thought that all dogs had the natural instinct to doggy paddle and therefore all dogs know how to swim. Is that not correct? 
All I can think about while watching this is ‚ÄòFloat On‚Äô by Modest Mouse. Lol
He wishes for a floating pillow, y‚Äôall.
when life gives you life jackets
Straight chillin
My dog learned to swim because i swam across a river when walking her. She had no choice but to follow, besides leaving me of course
Serious question. Do dogs really need swimming lessons? I saw another video last week of a dog getting lessons and it was the first I've ever heard of it. My pups used to just jump is and start kicking. We even have a swimming style called "doggie paddling" in their honor. 
Good Boyeant
Dogs don't "learn how to swim". They instinctively know how, assuming we haven't bred them into being too dense to float.

Dogs don't need to learn how to swim...
In a pool on a leash with a vest??!
Remove the life jacket, He‚Äôll learn how to swim.
Learn how to swim....? As far as I know practically all animals can swim by default.  It‚Äôs just us who need to learn. 
Don't dogs just isntinctively know how to swim already. 
I didn't know dogs needed to learn to swim. Does he have some sort motor skill issue that prevents him from doing what dogs do naturally in water? Regardless he's still the best boy.

Just throw him in with a harness and lead
You see if you want the dog to swim don't give him a life vest maybe?

Just enough effort to stay alive, well play bud.. well played
Who else doesnt know how to swim well but is able to keep their heads above water because of how tall they are?
He already knows how to swim by instinct.
Man I don‚Äôt even think my dog could float. Last summer he tipped my moms kayak over and I swear the poor thing sunk like a rock. Had a life jacket on and the water was a maximum of 3ft but he definitely panicked. 
Since the video resolution is kinda low--almost looks like doggo has been taxidermied. 

You sure he's breathing?
It would probably help him realize he should swim if he didn't have the vest on.
Amazing 
I‚Äôm not impressed he‚Äôs floating.

I‚Äôm impressed he can sit still in water. To whoever owns this dog, damn your luck and my misfortune.
