How could you say no to that?  This dog knows what he‚Äôs doing haha
That's how I made friends, just hugged them until they said we were friends.
16 and a half years ago my boy picked me. There were dogs everywhere - it was chaos! He calmly stepped out of the shed, fell flat on his face then sat up and looked me dead in the eye like "c'mon, let's get out of here."

Last week he passed at home in my arms. Together til the end. My perfect partner in crime. I wouldn't change a single second.
My squishy little blind old lady pushed the cage door open at the pound after we met her (we were going to check out some other dogs and think about it)‚Äî she kicked the door with her paw and we said ‚Äúwe really like you. We‚Äôll probably be back soon‚Äù‚Äî but‚Ä¶ she was really old, and part of us was scared to adopt someone who could break our hearts. We walked down the aisle looking at the younger dogs and turned the corner. And there she was; she had busted out of her kennel and was like ‚Äúpick me.‚Äù We knew then. Poor baby‚Äôs eye was oozing puss, she was covered in filth and we took her home that day thinking we would bathe her and watch her die.  Now it‚Äôs three years later and she‚Äôs happy, healthy, and safe. Best decision ever. She is blind and relies on her nose to get around and sometimes the little lady gets lost in a bathroom or behind a door. I can‚Äôt imagine how someone could see her sweet face and not want her.
Awe I love it when the puppers get to choose their people and the people choose them back!

Those shelter dogs have had a rough go so far; it warms my heart to see them go to a good home!
When we went to ‚Äúlook‚Äù at dogs I ended up being drawn to the saddest dog in the shelter. All the other dogs were coming to the door for pets but she just laid dejectedly curled up on her bed. It broke my heart, it felt like she had given up. We asked to see her and the person in charge said they‚Äôd have to ask if she was ready for visits and luckily she was cleared. Of course she immediately went to my husband and pretty much ignored me. The person showing us her was pleasantly surprised. They said she took weeks to warm up to them and this was the first time she‚Äôs gone to anyone like that. We adopted her as soon as she met our other dog and we were cleared to take her home. It took months before she wagged her tail. She would stand around our house and just space out. We could tell she was still trying to figure out her place in our home. Eventually she came out of her shell and now she‚Äôs the sweetest goofball. She is definitely a more anxious dog but hell, I‚Äôm an anxious human so I get it. I comfort her through the thunderstorms that shake our home and she comforts me through my own personal rain clouds. I love her so much and she‚Äôs brought so much happiness into our lives.

That's what our pupper did when we were at the shelter. Came up to my daughter and sniffed her face and gave her a kiss. Adopted her on the spot. She's been a wonderful part of our family now for the last 6 years.
We had a stray dog show up in our yard one night. Checked her chip, went to the address to try to bring her back. Owners had divorced and moved 4 months ago. Doggo apparently chose us after being abandoned. She loves the kids, will do anything to protect them. She loves our other pets, even made friends with one of the cats. We still have her 10 years later. Animals know good people. The best part, she is a huge lab mix named... Kitty.
Some connections are predetermined.
The way he looks at him in the end ü•∫ 

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been waiting for you for so long, I‚Äôm exhausted. Can we go home now?‚Äù
/r/DogsWithSocks
This hurts to watch. I can only imagine the one thing going through their little heads; ‚Äúplease take me home with you, i‚Äôll be a good boy i promise!‚Äù

I‚Äôve always said it, if we ever want a cat or dog, we‚Äôre going to the shelters first. Plenty of dogs and cats that need love too!
It was damn cool of the reporter to adopt the doggo
I got a retired racing greyhound five years ago.
I came into the kennel where the retired racers were kept. I'd done a ton of research into different breeds and I knew that because of my mental health challenges I had a bit of an impossible laundry list - Low maintenance, quiet, docile, good with kids and cats, good with being left alone during the workday...

I went into this kennel full of excited greyhounds and a lady asked me what I was looking for. I handed her the list, and in a tentative voice I asked "Could you find me one that's black, too?" - They always get adopted last and I kind of have a soft spot for them.

She pointed to a quiet fellow in a corner kennel. Didn't really look at anyone. He was so docile and gentle that he was in group with female greys who bullied him out of a place to lie down on the trip up!
I wasn't sure during the test walk. He was full of beans and excited and jumpy - I later learned because he was in a new environment and everything is exciting!

I brought him back and I knew he was going to be mine. Knew it for sure when the wonderful lady turned to me with hesitancy and a little sadness in her voice and said "He's got a torn tear duct. It's just cosmetic, there's nothing wrong, but will that be an issue? Some adopters passed him up, so I just wanted to be clear..."

Her voice trailed off a little sadly.

It was then, my friends, that I knew I wanted this dog. I don't really know why that in particular sealed the deal, but it did. I knew I was going to take him home. As I write this my beautiful jet-black though rapidly-greying nine-year-old retired racer is curled up on a nest of comfy blankets near my feet. He's my velcro dog, has kept me alive through bipolar episodes, and is a quiet and steady presence.

Anyone who says money can't buy happiness has never paid an adoption fee.

Edit: Dog tax!

This is INCORRECT! That dog adopted the reporter, I will accept nothing less than that.   


P.S - What a good boi
*The dog chooses the owner Mr Potter, that much has always been clear*
Not a shelter dog, but in 1995, my dad's friend had a dog that had puppies. We went up to get one, and when we got there, we saw a wave of rambunctious black lab puppies all playing and going nuts and just being puppies. Being 5, I was playing with all of them. My parents kept looking at them, seeing which one they wanted, but none of the puppies were paying any attention to them because puppies. 

But then the runt of the litter came over to my dad, laid down on his foot and fell asleep. My dad looks at his friend and goes "found my dog." She ended up outliving all of her siblings (the mother outlived all of them), and was enormous, bigger than all of her siblings, who just looked like black labs. Like, 150 lbs big. We were told she was a black lab and Australian Shepard mix, but she was too big to be that. So my dad calls his friend a few years later and is like "what is she really, because there's no Australian Shepard in this dog." His friend goes "oh, right, my dog got loose in the woods one day, and came back pregnant. Could be a coyote or a wolf, not sure." So that was a fucking wild bit of info to find out.

She was a good dog that one.
#Can anyone find more information on this?

Apparently this video is 2 years old but I can not find any information about this video. All I can find are fucking shit-tier """""news""""" articles regurgitating everything we can clearly see in the video with embarrassing omissions of details and facts. 

I need to know what happened to that dog I love it.
Is there a subreddit like /r/AnimalsAdoptingHumans ?  


Edit: Damn, no. But there could be, who wants to start it? :)
Sometimes you just know when you meet your person
When the dog chooses you, you're required to give them a home. I didn't make the rules; that's just how it is.
I've had exactly one shelter pup and she was the best dog I've ever known. Black lab/Aussie mix who was jet black with ice blue eyes. That girl was absurdly smart, dramatic, and the best friend/roommate/baby I've ever known. I'd adopt another from a shelter in a heartbeat except they keep finding me before they get to the shelter. One actually banged on my front door in the middle of the night begging to come in. We only fostered that one, but dang his forever family spoils him rotten!
That's a lady doggo.

She cute.
I hope the reporter did the on-air interview or story with his new dog clinging to his leg like that.
The dog was definitely begging for affection and love. Sheltered life can be very sad. I hope it‚Äôs true that reporter took the dog home.
[deleted]
Can anyone confirm the reporter adopted the dog?
aww   
what else could you do? Thankfully it's not an elephant rescue park
In soviet russia pupper adopts you
Oh fuck, something is in my eye. Fking fks.
That pupper needed a hero,  and got one! Win for both sides!
Dogs are better than people‚Ä¶10 X!!!
They keep them in confined spaces for so long that they're starved for any affection. You see this a lot sadly.
The last time I shed tears while watching a video like this was when one dog "owner" found his little buddy laying by the street after 3 years. This never leaves me untouched, man.
THIS IS THE NEWS WE NEED
I volunteer to walk shelter dogs and this is how I met my pibble. On the walk she kept looking up at my eyes, as if asking what I wanted her to do. When we got back to the shelter, I took her to the play yard to see what she would be like off-leash. After I took off her leash, instead of running around, she just sat down and looked up at me. It was then that I understood that she picked me, and that my home would be ours, and she would never suffer or be lonely again. 3 years later, I still cherish every moment with her.
they freaking know.  it's fucking beautiful.
The dog has a collar. I'm assuming they couldn't find the original owner.
best friends for life
‚ÄúMista! Mista! Get..me..outta.. heaaa!‚Äù
He adopted her
I got it on camera! He's MY hooman!
You dont choose doggo doggo chooses you
Did the reporter come here to ask what he should call his new dog?
Tell me that animals don't have intelligence, emotional intelligence and an effing soul and I'll tell you to fuck right off.
So so sweet! I remember when I first saw this it wasn‚Äôt clear if he adopted the dog :) but I think it‚Äôs a girl or a boy with big teets
BRB while I cry now
Doggo just knew that the reporter was his new papa
So many cute stories of dogs choosing their humans at the pound. 

Mine, not so much. She was anti-social. Ran from us, we barely got to pet her. We went through a lot of debate whether we should take her or not. We did. 

Flash forward two weeks and she runs up to everyone, makes howling noises when she sees people she likes, and is overall the most social fun-loving dog. 

Pounds are scary environments for some pups, just because they don‚Äôt know how to ‚Äúchoose you‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt need you! Some need time.
I work at a shelter. I LOVE seeing an animal choose their person rather than the other way around, it happens a lot more often than you'd think. Just yesterday a woman came in to see what cats we have available. As soon as she walked into the cat room, she got aggressively love-bombed by a typically shy cat name Ellen. She was in there with Ellen for probably a half hour, snuggling and petting her and playing with her and taking tons of photos. It was pretty surprising to see Ellen open up to someone so quickly but it's not the first time I've seen that happen.

Anywho, she's coming back to pick up Ellen tomorrow!
My dog did that. Went to look at dogs at the shelter and this dog came up and jumped on my leg and actually hugged me.

Adopted her that day. It‚Äôs been 5 wonderful years.

Normally when I see/read stories about dogs, I‚Äôll go pick my dog up and carry her around the apartment like a baby.

In fact I‚Äôm going to do that now.
Beagle love beats all. Even if only a part of her.
This is the way
Too cute !
Soulmates! ‚ô•Ô∏è
All I can see is that puppy saying, ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt leave me here. Please don‚Äôt leave me here. Please don‚Äôt leave me here. Please don‚Äôt leave me here.‚Äù
Clearly the little guy's plan succeeded.
How can you not üò≠üíômelted my heart
The dog adopted the hooman.

The dog chooses the owner, Mr. Potter.
I would too. Appropriate action
This is the way.

Perfect dog - man relationshipüòç
Yep, I would have stopped the interview and took it home immediately.
resistance is futile
Sweet short story!!!!!
This pupper just walked up and said this is my hooman!
Nailed it
Cutest thing I have seen today, we need more posts like this.
I love starting the day with a stream of tears lol
Well I mean there‚Äôs really no other option but to take him/her after that!
I am yours and you are mine
He knew he was going to be his forever home it was destined to be
This is both the saddest and happiest story I‚Äôve ever read.
This is mine
Awww poor baby looks like he's so done.
We really don‚Äôt deserve dogs.
That's how it's done shelter pups.
Dogs are too good for us.
Dogs can tell when someone has a good soul
Legend says the pupper is still hugging him to this day
I mean, free hugs daily, smartest move possible.
I believe the reporter was adopted by the dog.
Meesta meesta! Get. Me. Outta. Here!
The dog just adopted that guy lol
Aww look at that sweet boi. Dog's cute too.
Theres noooo way i could say no to that ‚ù§
And THATS how u get adopted‚Ä¶#WellDone
Oh my gosh made me cry. I am so happy for this sweet adorable dog.
Aww that's unconditional love at first sight.
Chosen :)
And they lived happily ever after.
The End.
"This hooman is mine now!"
How do you NOT
The dog adopted the reporter.
That‚Äôs how you bag a human!
Awwwww!!!!!!!

It‚Äôs like he adopted him first
My dog does this when I open the fridge
I‚Äôm not crying you‚Äôre crying
How could you say no to that? ‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüòç
As someone who has rescued pretty much every pet I've had from an animal shelter, I honestly do feel my family never picked a single one. They always chose us
Animals know good people.
The wand chooses the wizard and this dog chose his owner. You love to see it! Beautiful
*EVERYONE LIKED THAT*
![gif](giphy|j0qSbeNFuzjhXKFVSP)
my advice to people going to a shelter is to always see what picks you.
5 years ago my cat picked me out at the shelter by letting me pick her up, and then proceeding to try to bite my beard. She came home with me that day, and still lets me carry her around like a baby.
that damn look on his face‚Ä¶ i feel like i‚Äôve known this dog for 5 years and was subjected to that look for 5 years

really, i‚Äôm very happy for this dog and reporter.
I didn‚Äôt know what sub this was at first and let out an audible ‚Äúaww‚Äù. Well done, ya got me
"Pleeeeeeeesh... pleeeeeeeesh...."
I walked into the shelter with a long list of dogs off petfinder of the general size I was after. First on the list was Lady, a black terrier-mix with a crooked ear and a bright expression. I got her out of her kennel to meet her, and the shelter worker told me they called her lady because she was very delicate and particular. We sat down in the play yard in the back and Lady trotted over to me, pulled my arm toward her with a paw, then crawled all 40lbs of herself into my lap.

I don‚Äôt meet any of the other dogs on my list that day. Lady is now Kiki and is my constant cuddly companion for over two years now.

When I went to a shelter to get a dog, this one husky rolled over on his back and put his paws in the air, cutest thing ever. I had him for 3 years now.
Who the FUCK is dicing onions this early?!
As cute as this is, I have to wonder why?

Does the dog do the same for everyone?
Did he smell like candy?
Was the dog particularly enthralled by this human?
Was the dog just in a cute mood?
OOF, those wide splayed paws... That pup REALLY wanted to go with the guy.  In my experience working with greyhounds, they tend to do this when they REALLY want attention.  Kinda like holding on to something.
Does anyone have any idea how the dog makes this kind of connection? Would it do this to anyone or is there a smell or something that the dogs genuinely just attracted to?
Doggo understood the assignment.
When your pet chooses you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
awe, im glad that the reporter adopt the dog :)

Yes I almost have this stupid human within my grasp! Time for the huge eyes!
Sweet doggo good hooman

Thank you reporter person. We can all come up with at least 10 reasons why we can't take in a pet. (Don't have time/space/ money, someone else will take them, etc.) It's easy to talk yourself out of so thank you for accepting this dog's heartwarming love!
This video makes ME want to adopt him.  So great the reporter gave him a home.
Sometimes you adopt a pet. Sometimes, the pet adopts you.
Yeah he‚Äôs like ‚Äúthis is my hooman now‚Äù
Mission failed, successfully.
The onion chopping ninjas strike again.
That is one sweet old girl.  She looks about 12 years old, which means she only probably has a few years left, but I hope he makes those the best few years of her life.

Nah, he didn't adopt the pupper, pupper adopted him.  Dogs are the best people.

We truly don't deserve animals. Let alone dogs, they show unconditional love to the purest form.
That man has been adopted whether he likes it or not.
The dog adopted the human
He went for the casual butt sniff. He's not slick.
Source on the adoption part?
I don't believe in any form of higher power or fate, but some things are just meant to be.
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying
Aww
If the reporter didn‚Äôt adopt, it would have been a doggone crime. 

(Apologies, I‚Äôm a new father.)
The dog is saying we are bonded for life even before you knew it
My rescue pup chose me the same way. He nestled he's head into me until i couldnt let him go. Found out later that he had fractured his skull in the foster home and the infection had spread through his bones. They choose you, it could not have been more clearer.
Now that's something nice to read almost 1st thing in the morning! such a good boy deserves a happy home
Incorrect, the dog adopted the reporter.
this is so cute it physically hurts

And that's how Francis, the murderer dog, found his 4th family and continued with his spree of atrocities.
I love dogs, but this is why I refuse to go to a shelter. I'd want to take them all home.

This is so obviously not a news reporter.
this is not the time to make me sentimental
My now 17-year-old poodle leaped into my arms at the shelter. I took him home. He was five then. Twelve years later, he is still my best friend. Every dog i have ever had was adopted from a shelter.
Dogs have so much love to give.
And that‚Äôs how you get adopted.
So cute
My wife spent a few hours at a shelter while I was at work meeting a dog. Apparently the dog was slow to trust and uninterested in interacting or playing. I showed up after work and having no interaction with the dog he jumped up on me and licked my face and wouldn't leave my side. He's ours for 2 years now and he's my absolute best friend.
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs
This reminds me of my shelter dog. He told me to get him the hell out of there, so I did.
Anyone know if there is a follow up to this story? Like where are they now kind of thing?
This is what we in the industry call a Pro Orphan Move.
They choose us, it's like we are the Pok√©mon and they are the masters
Please take me home with you haha so cute.
Poor doggo. He just needed some help, and fortunately he got it.
What is this? A musical about dogs? Did I miss the opening "I wish" song about finding a forever home? What's next, going to the reporters 1 bedroom apartment and seeing a no dog sign, maybe a song about how dogs destroy everything with the landlord? 

Because I'm down for it.
Love it

My sister adopted her dog without even looking for a dog. My nephew really likes going to see dogs at adoption events and what not, but he always knew they wouldn't bring a dog home from, he wanted to go anyway. So they're at one and Some lady walks up to my sister and asks her if she's wants to hold that puppy for a minute. Well the lady never came, and my sister adopted the pup. She's 3 now and gets along great with the new kitten too.
Thank you for adopting him!! U saved a life and he loves üíï you!!
This was the reason I got my dog Princess. Was years ago. I was 9-10 years old and begged my mom to take me to the humane society to see the dogs. I had the day off of school and my dad worked so we had nothing better to do anyways. After awhile she reluctantly agreed and we went. Got there and was looking through all the kennels. Old dogs, younger dogs, small dogs and big dogs. Came across this one kennel that had two puppets in it. One stayed back in the corner and the other was up front. I walked up and she was the most adorable and loving little thing. Licked me and whined and pawed at me. Anytime I tried to walk away she stuck her leg out the fence holes and cried for me. I‚Äôd go back and pet them walk away and it happened again. So I turned and told my mom I couldn‚Äôt leave without her. Had that girl for close to 11 years before she passed. I still remember the look on my dads face when he came back from work and there was a new dog in the house. ü§£
Will you be my human?
Dog adopted his person!
‚ÄúThis one‚Äôs mine‚Äù
How could anyone not love dogs after seeing this?
How anyone can go out and buy a dog from a breeder is beyond me when sweet babies like this are living alone and cold in shelters.
Cause that‚Äôs yo dawg
He has been chosen
Great story. What‚Äôs up with the resolution though? Was this filmed in war torn Bosnia and Herzegovina circa 1994 or maybe filmed in 2002 on a BlackBerry?
Great story though, brilliant pup.
I've had a rough go of it lately,  I really needed that  ‚ù§
‚ÄúPlease take me with you. This place is full of dogs.‚Äù

Ain't nobody surving affection like that! In the words of the legendary Hudson from Aliens (played by the legendary Bill Paxton), "Game over, man. Game over."
What a sweet dog!
That's so sweet it brought tears to my eyes! Bless them both!
He understood the assignment
"I choose you."
I somehow thought he would start humping her leg
I find this rather creepy
I think the dog adopted the human.
The dog played his cards right‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm not crying. You‚Äôre crying.
This dog knows how to shamelessly beg
That is just the purest thing ever
How could you not adopt the precious baby after that? He picked his human.
Aren‚Äôt dogs just the best?
Amazing
Love is mutual, and human beings are also an advanced animal.
Omg that's heart melting. And I would do the exact same ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sleep)
This was how i got my first shelter puppo. He just sat there sad and wagged his tail when i looked at him, looking very very sad. He didn't cheer up until we went into the house and he realized it's not just a volunteer walk.
awh its disgusting how some people treat animals. I just don't understand how someone can do it
How could you not? That dog just wants someone to take care of him.  I would have too.  In a second!  

When I got my 1st dog we got it thru a rescue.  When we went to pick her up, her brother was in the group and you could tell that he wanted to come with us and his sister. I felt bad separating them.  I waited around to make sure that the family that was going to take him showed up.  If they didn't then we were fully prepared to take the two of them.
Good human.
Dis one. I choose dis hooman.
This made me hear those lyrics from Les Mis when they sing;

Great adpt him
My doggo did this when I went to pick him up from his knee surgery. First night he didn‚Äôt sleep with us.
Nice
He owed the other dogs treats and this was his last ditch attempt to get out, or he would be sleeping with the squeaky toys.
I like to imagine that this good boy was a passed away loved one who has been reincarnated in the form of a dog with the same soul, I don‚Äôt know.
Sometimes LOVE finds you.

Dog: And that, my friends, is how its done.
Wow! So incredibly sweet! ü•∫

We must try to help animals with health problems and help healthy ones in search of adequate and good owners.  The more good you do, the better the planet.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
This one actually made my eyes tear up a lil bit hah
‚ù§
Pog dog
Well, if you know you can't live up to the responsibility you shouldn't take it.
So how sad it is for the dog, he might have been worse off if said reporter had adopted him and if that's the case kudos for him.
Any clue what breed of dog that is? Looks identical to my adopted girl.
You‚Äôve been chosen. Don‚Äôt ignore it
Was it dog reasoning or natural selection?
I'm not crying!! I'm weeping!!
My wife and I went to a shelter to look for a dog to adopt.  They brought one in and we sat on the floor to meet him. He walked over to my wife laid down with his head on her leg and let out a big sigh.

We took him home.  He was the best dog.
Only reason I'm cryin..is cuz of the adrenaline..
In case you were wondering, yes, animals experience many of the same feelings we do as sentient beings‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
Chonky boi üòÅüòÅüòÅ
I remember reading once that dogs don‚Äôt like hugs and I immediately knew it was bullshit because my dog will walk right up to you and hug you if you‚Äôre sitting at face level to him. It wasn‚Äôt something thag was taught either
Minus the cameras this is how I got my dog. Just went to volunteer but she wouldn‚Äôt stop hugging me once I sat down.
Absolutely beautiful! Soul Mates!
Unfortunately the only time I've picked out a dog was from a breeder when I was really young (any other dog was purposely chosen for something or a stay). When I got her, they all looked the same and couldn't decide but suddenly she came over to me and kind of picked me. She ended up following me everywhere and was the most kind and caring dog I'd ever have so far. 

I remember one time I was building a pillow fort when she came running inside excited to see me. When she saw I was building something she grinded to a halt and carefully stepped over the pillows. She was a wonderful baby and I'm sad she had to pass the way she did
Doggos plan to get adopted:
1.  Be the goodest boy
2.  See step 1
You mean the pup adopted the reporter hahaha
No, the dog adopted the reporter.
I e said it a million times‚Ä¶
We don‚Äôt choose them.
They choose us!
My dog did the same to me. I adopted her over 8 years ago. She‚Äôs my family. Words can‚Äôt convey how deep I love her.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my human now.‚Äù
They better have adopted that puppy
NOBODY EXPECTS THE SPANISH INQUISITION
Lucky reporter!
They‚Äôre both females but yeah, very cute story.
Dog- ‚Äútoday, I finally found my hooman- and I adopted him‚Äù
No doubt, I‚Äôd have adopted that pupper too.
Awww ‚ù§Ô∏è
That‚Äôs how I got my gizmo. My white pomchi. My partner and I went to the pound and were actually looking for a little dog. Couldn‚Äôt find one that we liked and were about to walk away when my partner tells me to go check the big dog section. I said sure why not. And behold. In a big cage there was a little pomchi. It made me laugh and he came up to us. Went belly side up and wanted scratches and licked us. My little angel is now with me for 6 years. Love the little champ.
We ended up with twins that way, we went in to get a friend for our six year old dog. Meet this adorable but energetic terrier chihuahua mix and decided No because of his energy lvl and to keep looking. The moment they took him, he fought to be taken back and screamed cried as we were looking at another dog that we fell in love with. I wanted to take her back to meet her new sibling but we decided it would be cruel to only take one while the other was still having a screaming tantrum. Now all threw hog our beds, became the joy and pain in our lives. We named the energetic one bananas, because he's fucking bananas. 
 There's cookie bear, a wire hair doxi mix and her older sister, Jellybean (Formerly called Papita/little fry at the shelter)
We sure that‚Äôs a ‚ÄúHim‚Äù?
Maybe he‚Äôs a crisis dog.
I‚Äôve felt like this dog before! We just wanna belong
Instant feels
I keep upvoting the same reposted sh\*t
My cold frozen heart just melted.  I'm so mad.
Reporter: this just in, I have a new friend.
Awesome reporter!
I think the camera guy needs new equipment
Damn, that hurts
I‚Äôll upvote now and every time I see it. Just naawwww!
My cat clung on to my arm with his claws while putting when I first saw him at the shelter. I couldn‚Äôt go home without him.
"I'll take this one. He has a job." *-doggo, maybe*
I‚Äôm not crying, your cryingüò¢
Aww look at that fat bellyü•∞
‚ÄúVicious shelter dog steals heart of reporter, won‚Äôt give back - you‚Äôre next‚Ä¶we‚Äôre there live right after our commercial break‚Äù
As someone who now has 4 rescues, 2 dogs 2 cats:
Poor baby has separation anxiety but luckily with love and patience it can be worked through!
My baby girl Charlotte (dog) would destroy everything when we were away. We realized that a lot of it was because she didn‚Äôt know we would be coming back. We started leaving the house for 1 hour.. then progressively increased the time. 
Now only once in a while does she shred something (like once a year), and all of us can do full work days or be gone from their breakfast till dinner and they will be fine!
Poor baby what a sweetheart. 
Good to hear the reporter adopted him. 
A happy ending.
Dogs are the best!
I have 2 cats but this makes me want a dog.
Awwwwwü•∫
Dogs are a blessing
the good ending
Love ‚ù§Ô∏è it
Shelter cats hate him for this one weird trick...
Awwwww
It is like magic! As if it knew that it has found its true partner!
Sad dog eyes
How can anyone walk away from that it would haunt me for the rest of my life if I did
Awe, how could you not take that baby home. So happy the reporter adopted her
Guys wife: ‚Äúlet me get this straight, I gotta walk a dog now and find a way to get this stain off your jeans?‚Äù
This is why I can‚Äôt go to sheltersüò≠
What behavior is this dog displaying here though. Tail between the legs kinda means scared no? Or typically does.
No way in hell I could have left without that dog
When I adopted my bun she was lounging in a big tank in the shelter but she got up and hopped over and put her little paw up to touch the glass right where I was touching the glass and that was the end of my shelter trip. It was like a cartoon movie.
That's a news camera?
I remember one time I was having such a bad day that it brought me to tears and my dog at the time would not leave my side for the entire night.
Good on the reporter
This happened to me years ago, when I visited an animal shelter before writing a story about how volunteers get attached to the pets. The cats were loose in this shelter, and one of them kept jumping on the counter to lick my face and disrupt my photography. I told the rest of the family to go visit, and that they would immediately figure out which cat I was talking about. They did and we adopted her that day.
Doggo was like I‚Äôm leaving one way or another but I‚Äôm not getting down
He wants out
‚ÄúPlease get me the fuck outta here‚Äù
*"Please human, take me out of this hell hole"*.
Awe hell‚Ä¶
That's why I think that they choose humans to live with and not vice versa![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
So sweet
DIBS!!!!
Meanwhile, I feel like I have to force mine to love me.
This puppers understood the assignment.
My heart it cant take it
He‚Äôs thanking him for bringing awareness to him and his pupper friends
I adopted a shelter dog almost 12 years ago. She passed away Sunday. I think it would be awesome to open a animal sanctuary. Then I could be around amazing animals everyday!!
What an affectionate doggie!  I would have to take him!
Popa you love me?
Dog said, "Ah yes, that one looks friendly, I'll take this human please."
Adopt don't shop !
That‚Äôs genuine love
How could you not take him home?
This is pretty much how I ended up with my 40 lbs goof ball.  Went to a shelter adoption event, several friendly puppers there, but Miss Missy had to come straight out of her kennel and plop down in my lap.  It's been a fantastic six years so far.
Is there a source or proof of this lol
‚ÄúCome on Carl‚Ä¶. You are NEVER gonna get adopted‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah? Hole my kibble‚Ä¶..‚Äù

‚ÄúDudes got no shame‚Ä¶.‚Äù
That dog knew exactly what to do to get adopted. I'm sure he owns the bedroom now, and eats filet mignon every day for dinner. And he deserves it all.
Connected souls
The only news I wanna hear
If he doesn‚Äôt adopt him, let‚Äôs cancel him.
Yeah I‚Äôd keep him too
Nice, there are good people out there.
Animals are angels ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh my gaaawd I have never seen anything like this in 53 yrs and I‚Äôm a world traveler dayum snif snif
Probably the best dog he's ever had
This is what doggy heart eyes looks like
Dog was like; Got ya', can't not adopt me now or the whole world will think your a monster. Hehehehe sucker.
Is really too docile.
You are special and have been chosen , bless you good kind and caring human. Poochie updates are now necessary...seeing as how you are a reporter... REPORT...and thanks
PS...that picture and story made me very misty and all choked up  because I LOVE happy endings
That breaks my heart
So cute that dog
"shelter puppy decided to adopt a reporter for its pet."
I think the doggy adopted him.
"Shelter pupper chooses reporter as his human."

Fixed that title for you.
My brothers cat got adopted in a similar way. When they were leaving after viewing the cats, he reached out of his cage and snagged my brothers sleeve like "hey man, you gotta spring me!'. Obviously, they had to take him home. 

An old cat of mine chose me, but in a different way: the SPCA volunteer pointed him out, as I would never have noticed him otherwise. He had been taken to the woods and just thrown out there. When they found him he was a starved little skeleton and all beat up. He had been in the shelter for a month by the time I saw him and was so depressed he just laid there staring at the side of the cage. Even when we opened the door he didn't respond, and barely acknowledged food. I sat with him for 10 minutes with one hand by his face so he could smell me and just talked to him and gently petted him. After about 10 minutes he nuzzled his head into my hand and started to purr just a little bit as if to say "maybe.....maybe I can feel trust again". I took him home and over the years he came out of his shell and had the loudest purr and loved cuddles.
I wouldn't have left without that puppy either.
That reporter went on to be the bestest boy... Just like doggo....
Doggo be like - HaHa he fell for it so easily
I wish my wife would hug me like that! Time to adopt!!
"Take me away from this awful place"
Good reporter good puppers
I think that reporter just got adopted
This needs a follow up story

C‚Äômon reporter , I want to see how poppers is doing now
Heard as soon as the reporter got the dog home, the dog robbed the reporter.
So cute !
He knew what he was doing.
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs‚Ä¶
Mission accomplished
I feel so bad his tail is tucked so tight.   Maybe he is just horrified and wants to go home and snuggle bc he‚Äôs a old sweet grandpa
That's a smart ass dog
I‚Äôm not gonna lie my heart is mush right now ü•∞
he isnt human if he didnt
This is the way.
i'm not a dog person, but gosh dogs are amazing
With the amount of love that dog is giving I‚Äôll adopt him too be like come here baby you my new kid
And this my friends is how you get adopted by a cute pupper üíï
That's great! Look at him! He's such a good boy. How could you possibly leave and not. I would be thinking about him for days.
So adorable üòçü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs‚Ä¶period!!!
It would be cool to see an update on this story with photos of the dog happily enjoying its new life.
When the animal picks you you have no choice you are the family nowüíï
Plot twist: he was the original owner
Super sweet.
Why are you sending me this shit
This gets posted at least once a month, and there's still absolutely zero proof on the entire internet that this dog was adopted by the reporter. It never happened. The story doesn't exist. This thing has been bandied around as fact for years, and people just accept it as fact because it appeals emotionally, and it *feels* like that's what happened. A perfect microcosm for how actual misinformation spreads on this website. I dare anyone to provide *actual* proof that this dog was adopted by this reporter, and not just some random article that regurgitates the video with no sources or references. Give me the reporter's name. Give me the station's name. Show me the puff piece they were working on. Should be easy to find, right?
"I'd like to adopt this human."
He picked his own owner himself, like big boi.
I love that the reporter adopted the cute pupper! ‚ù§
I mean honestly, how could you say no?
I wish we would have seen him in the car leaving :(
That doggy adopted him.
1. Looks like a her. 2. Already has a collar on?
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou‚Ä¶.I choose you‚Äù it‚Äôs crazy how dogs can pick
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
This does a lot of good for my heart
Would‚Äôve done the same thing
Pupper to the other dogs: A'ight imma head out  
_latches on_
Man's best & loyal friend till the end.
Adorable
Me hugging my gay bf
Man. Thats really sad. Sometimes I need a hug too and nobody is there so I drink as a cope mechanism. Imagine being a poor doggo they cant deal with that.
baby..
The reporters look/scent must have reminded the dog of a previous, happier life.
Cut to the weeks before of a genius shelter worker teaching groups of dogs how to do this.
I would really like to have a dog someday, I think. I move a lot though, and I know having a dog will limit my housing options.
Dogs just want to have a family so bad, we don‚Äôt deserve them
dropped some tears ..
If she left without that dog‚Ä¶
"Come here big guy, it's time to get you home."

Thanks doggo
Poor guy he‚Äôs thinks if he hugs the reporter enough the reporter will take him home.
well played doggo, well played
If a dog did this to me, there would be no question, it's mine. The shelters should train the dogs to do this. They'd all get adopted!
Same thing happened to me about 8 years and 11 weeks ago.
That sweet baby knew he found his dad ü•∞
Awww ü•∞
10/10 Best Doggo!
I saw this post and never get tired of seeing it! This is so awesome üëè
Good on you feller you definitely won‚Äôt regret it that‚Äôs for sure.
This made my eyes swell with tears. What a beautiful story.
Who rescued who? This is adorable!
the dog understood the assignment
That doggie adopted the reporter.
The reporter: " In the todays news, I adopted new puppy".
I‚Äôm not crying. You are. üò≠ this is so sweet.
Whoos a gooood boooooyy
I knew a guy who tried that with a woman at a bar once.  She didn't take him home, but the police did.
He was letting that reporter know that he was actually just for him, reporter just didn‚Äôt know it yet :)
What a Sweet dog.
*leaves work early to go home and hug dog*
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote) Thank you for making the world just a lil bit better. Made my day seeing this pure love and relief. :)
Charisma 100
I‚Äôm taking this one...ü•∫
Is it a shelter for humans? The cameramen got adopted
Dog: You. Mine. What took you so long?
He sports the Misfits gloves better than the Only brothers!
My manly man heartstrings are being tugged‚Ä¶ must. Not. Let. Tears fall‚Ä¶
I would do the same
That‚Äôs how I got my rescue dog.
That reporter fell for the oldest trick in the book.
Why am I crying
10 years ago my little guy pulled this move on me at the shelter. Worked like a charm.

Reporting from a potato?
So thankful he adopted this dog üôèüíûüíûüíû
I tried doing this to a lady reporter and got thrown into a jail! such world!!
What a sweetheart
Sometimes a pet just finds their human, and I've never seen a case where the human doesn't realise it too.
That‚Äôs a her btw...
I choose you hooman :)
Every time I‚Äôve chosen a dog it was bc they wouldn‚Äôt leave me alone. Dogs should choose you, not the other way.
Sometimes it's not you who choose the dog, but the dog who choose you.
This is beautiful! I'm not crying you're crying. üòâ‚ù§üêæ
Ahh. Good reporter
They sense nice and bad people
No....YOU'RE all crying
Human gets adopted by shelter pup üòä
r/wholesome
I reluctantly agreed to foster an old man dog who kept getting returned. He promptly hopped up in my lap and never left. He‚Äôs the sweetest dog I‚Äôve ever had!
Every time this video makes me want a dog. I've got two pups and this still makes me feel without.
TBH made me cry - can't we do more for these animals?
My cat did the same at the shelter, then fell asleep in my arms. I had to take him home.
Poor lil guy was like "Hey, man, gemme outta here!"
Awwww üò∞poor baby is saying ‚Äúplease rescue me from here‚Äù
Dogs are too good for us.
Dog to other dogs: I am not spending another fucking day in this hellscape. I‚Äôm getting a new life. Watch me.
I don't like when dogs jump up on me, but this dog seems to be more polite and frankly seems desperate. A bit heart breaking to watch, but glad to hear the dog got adopted
I mean, it's not like you have a choice.
We need more of this news
We are seeing a lifetime bond forming in real time.  God bless dogs.
