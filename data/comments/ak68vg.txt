Fluffy baby got more fluffy. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
She is stunning! What a wonderful thing you‚Äôve done! 
P.S. She didn't have a chip. In our country there are many homeless animals without microchip is.
Bless your heart.
That is a goddamn goddess of a cat!
Amazing what rehab does.
In all honestly , you‚Äôre the true mvp. Thank youüíô‚ù§Ô∏è
Post the after in r/supermodel cats.
I love how the tail to body ratio gets reversed üòÇ ‚ù§Ô∏è
You're a good person. That's a beautiful cat.
Thank you so much for giving this kitty a good home and an amazing life
She looks like she could be a Turkish angora! Does she have toe floofs? :)
Cats don't die; they just become increasingly grouchy snarled gremlins.  Then you feed them and give them warmth and cuddles, and all of a sudden... \*\~\**FLOOF!\*\~\** 

Excellent work, OP.
Is that the same cat? Why isn't the tail fluffy?
What kind of eye liner does she use??
/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption
Wow I‚Äôm so glad she adopted you! 
So sweet of u to love him/her!
Aw. She‚Äôs beautiful. How is she settling in? Does she thoroughly thank you with love and affection for giving her a home? üòç
I got my cat off the street. He was living on any water he found and scraps the store he slept by had given him. Luckily, my dad saw him one day while delivering some stuff to the store and took him under his care. He‚Äôs currently 6 years old and living strong! Very happy my dad made the choice to take him.
The way she looks up to you.. we do too!
She looks healthier, but is her tail less fluffy now? 
Does Chonky Floofers have her own insta page yet? She is gorgeous!
Who could abandon such a beautiful creature?  That‚Äôs a top notch cat.  üëå
/r/supermodelcats 

What a beauty.  Please tell her that I admire her very much.
I also have a street cat - he showed up on Christmas and I took him in but he really saved me. (He actually was chipped, but Animal Control decided he was not to be returned to prior owners).

He's still quite a ragamuffin, his coat is a constant losing battle.  He's currently getting a brushing/trim but he probably needs daily baths in all honesty!

Thank you for recusing this lovely one!
Bless you for rescuing this kitty! May I ask how you posted two pictures on your post? I've tried to do the same but it will only post one. Thanks!
Wow. It looks like two different cats. Uh

This past fall we took in a starving kitty that had been living under our house and was malnourished. Got her fed and cleaned up and acclimated to our dog and now we have an awesome new addition to the family. She's grey and black stripped and really cuddly but still goes outside and hunts daily. 

Cool post op. Wish I thought to take before and after pics of our rescue.
aww she‚Äôs so beautiful! 
What a majestic fluff
Woooow, looks majestic üòç
What a beautiful baby! Good work! 
I want to fluff it's fluff
Beautiful. Good work!
So pretty!!!
One month difference??!! Wow amazing, how much of a weight difference? He/She looks amazing.
Beautiful, and good on you for taking her in.

Any issues with her hearing? There‚Äôs a much higher chance of white cats being deaf than any other coloration.
I think it‚Äôs great how quick he‚Äôs put on weight. Just think, he‚Äôd never experience what it‚Äôs like to be chonk without you!
You are good hooman, hooman.
Also, gorgeous cat.
Eeeeeee why would anyone put that gorgeous baby out
That is the single most beautiful cat I‚Äôve ever seen. Jesus, she‚Äôs like a celestial goddess. 
Can you please post more pictures ü§©
Oh my how beautiful 
Never has the term Pretty Kitty been more apt. 
Those eyes! 
Thank you for your kindness.
Chonky
Looks fat now
Hairy baby! (O-O)
"Majestic" gets thrown around quite a bit, but I think it really applies here.
This makes me so happy! Similar to how I found my first cat (which later led to a litter of kittens...). No regrets! :) 
Too cute!
What a stunner! Many props to the great job you've done rescuing this one!
aww it looks so content now.  
you're awesome for doing this!
Wow, beautiful coat on him/her now! Good work OP. 
Best cat!
Such a beautiful ball of white fluff! 
You are a great person. 
Oh my what beautiful eyes!
God she's beautiful
She‚Äôs beautiful, you have done a great job! Keep it up!
She looks happy to be rescued!
thank you for rescuing this absolute beauty!üòª
i just want to hug this cat
He is getting fat, little fatty livin the good life.
You are a hero! You saved a life. She is absolutely gorgeous! A gem of a kitty!
She's beautiful üíö
This is lovely. 
Beautiful baby!! Thank you and congrats!
What a beautiful cat! 
You are a Saint. 
What a lucky kitty to have crossed your path.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
Ooh she a chonker now!
Same situation happened with my cat. He was a pretty scrawny stray a little under a year old and stayed at my doorstep until I fed him. Now he's been with me for almost 3 years and he's as healthy and well fed as ever.
Beautiful beautiful cat
You are a wonderful person for finding this kitty and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre feeling that you found a great friend. Rescue pets are the way to go. Just some love and food and a home, what a remarkable change. Good on you‚ù§Ô∏è
This almost made me cry. Good work OP.
You are the kitty saint
You‚Äôre awesome for rescuing this fur baby üêæüíï
You are a kind soul OP this cat will not forget it ever 
It looks like she got lost on the way to a Disney movie.
Thank you for rescuing :) 
When I was a kid we rescued two stray kittens in Istanbul... so many strays there, wish I could have taken them all in but we would go around the streets feeding as many as we could :) the two that lived with us were really sick and so thin... and after taking care of them they got so big and strong and became so lively and their personalities finally came out, it's a beautiful and rewarding experience. Wish I had photos of them, they looked so much more healthy and happy. :) 
Yes, this is the same cat. Bless you for doing such a great job getting her back in shape. Look at those eyes. The color difference is from lighting and exposure differences. Good job.
Bless your soul OP
That cat appreciates you more that you can ever know. 
Looks like my twin cats who i rescued as kittens born to a feral pack of cats living in the back of a parking lot. One lived to be 18, and the other went to 21.... passed in 2018. Got them in 1997. Loved those cats, really miss them.
Wow, wonderful job! You are a good person.
What a gorgeous fur baby! She has a good home now. Give her head lots of scratches for me.
You're a wonderful person! Love that beautiful kitty for it's lovely life

&#x200B;
She looks like a little chunker. What a beautiful kitty. Thanks for giving her all the love and food. I have a chunky fluffer too.
Godbless u for saving this beauty
That‚Äôs one beautiful kitty! Start stocking up on lint roller brushes now. I see many furry black shirts in your near future. Lol
This needs more upvotes !!!
I am good girl

You can bet that

I looked like squirrel

Now healthy cat.
How is this post still up? Mods do your damn job. It's literally the very first rule:

>No "sad" content, such as pics of animals that have passed away (try /r/petloss), before-and-after adoption pics (try /r/BeforeNAfterAdoption), or sob stories (e.g. found him in a dumpster).
Me IRL vs. me on Snapchat
/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption kinda similar? I mean you‚Äôve adopted the precious fluff into your home so I don‚Äôt see why it couldn‚Äôt be there? Beautiful fur baby btw! 
There should be a cat show category for this: most improved rescue. You would have to substantiate the cat coming off the streets or from a shelter, and show the greatest improvement in the cat's physical health and emotional happiness, to win.
Those are two different cats.  

So fluffy !
She looks sweet
Gorgeous! This is what ‚ù§Ô∏è can do üêæ
Fuller coat, fuller body and fuller eyes.
Hubba hubba. Great looking cat 
FLOOF
Thousand yard stare. If only you could see what I have seen with these eyes.
Beauty!‚ù§
oh my god he looks like an exiled prince or princess ,that was saved by a friendly passerby (you)
You are a good hooman.
Those eyes in the after picture are so pretty that they look fake 
Thank you 
SO FLOOF
such a cute fluffy cat ! Does the cat has a name? 
Beautiful cat!
Wow, only one month difference? That's a LOT of fur and body weight recovery for such a short period of time. When I adopted a Persian (also at least 66% floof) this took more like 4-6 months. 

Gorgeous kitty!
She is a gorgeous little thing!! 
Get yourself a furminator. Great rescue. 
Its so plump and happy now. You can see the life in her eyes. 
You rescued the  Gisele B√ºndchen of cats. 
She definitely made herself at home.
Omg shes so cute and thicc ‚ô•
Grew into its tail. 
Who let that cat go
Those eyes! 
Hungry floof. Fabulous floof. 
She is so pretty. 
RIP the color black in your wardrobe.

Good on ya though
So pretty!  Amazing transformation!!!  Yay for saving such a beautiful lady.
What dryer sheets do you use?
So cute. But never wear black. 
I can't believe this is one month. I bet she is so happy to be loved and to not have to worry about food any more!
What a beautiful and fluffy girl, I'm so glad she was able to find a safe and happy home with you. Makes my heart warm. :)
What a beauty! She has the greatest eyes! So glad she found a good human to take her in!
It really goes to show the importance of white balance in photography.
Aw, wow, glad people like you exist. What a beautiful kitty.
Wow. A month of love worked wonders.
That's a pretty kitty to be left in streets.
A Nordic Queen ...great work!
FLUFF! I love her üòç 
What a beautiful and healthy cat. God bless u
What a beautiful cat! :)
Give that cute kitty some hugs from me
Wow such a gorgeous cat!!!! All my cats have been strays we take in, they make the most grateful and friendly cats ever :)
I have a fluffy kitty that was a rescue too! She is black and white and her black markings make her look like she has eye liner. It's crazy how much good food and some love can transform them. You kitty is gorgeous!
What a treasure!!  Beautiful!  You‚Äôre a wonderful person to help this lost cat.  
He/She looks very much like my old buddy, Mr. Fiddles. 

RIP Mr. Fiddles!
What a beauty!  Thanks for saving this sweetheart :)
you do is very good
Your cat‚Äôs before and after pics look like my real life vs Snapchat filter pics üòÇ
Cute little white fluffy cat.
Wow what a beautiful floof!
Absolutely gorgeous. A royal kitty
Out of curiosity, is she deaf? Every all white cat I've ever came across has been.
 Shes a beauty üíãüíã
You are a saint.  How people treat helpless animals says so much.

edit: what a beautiful cat.  You brought that out.
That's a fuckin nice kitty
Wow, recovered really well in just a month
FLUFFY FABULOUS!
Sepia toned lovin‚Äô üòç
You're wonderful. 
What a stunner!
Wow just a month.  I'm amazed at how fast animals can recover.
Wow. From street to royal. 
I‚Äôm not even a cat person but that is one beautiful feline!!! You two are lucky to have found one another :)
Holy majestic floof. This cat is beautiful.
Floof
Mesmerizing eyes ! 
Floofles!
Gorgeous cat
If this cat was a woman, she'd be hot. 
It's like the body absorbed all the hair from the tail
Great job, I wish people did it more often. 
Hero ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is she deaf? Some white cats are... Also, if you live in a climate with harsh sun, please make sure she doesn't get too exposed. Cats get sunburnt just like us pale people. 
The difference between love and indifference.  Good, good job, OP. 
Thank you for doing this OP <3

That's one beautiful kitty.
she‚Äôs so beautiful!!! Thank you for helping an animal in needü•∞
That's the power of love,  what a beautiful transformationüíï
How did someone leave this beauty out on the streets?!?!! Thank you for rescuing this amazing fluff ball. 
OMG, you're such a wonderful person for rescuing! My heart!!
You're a good person. üëç
Wow! That's a gorgeous looking cat right there. üòçüòç

Holy shit! Those eyes are STUNNING!
He‚Äôs a beauty! Thank you for your kindness! 
She‚Äôs stunning! 
SHE‚ÄôS SO FLUFFY
she has such beautiful green eyes!
So adorable
Good on you, OP. Beautiful things being done.
All the fur in her tail went to her torso 
It's like the bushy-ness of her tail diffused to the rest of her body.
She lost her grey tint? 
Beautiful ü•∞
Beautiful üòä
How long did it take her to trust you ?
Do you think cars become move loving after a "rescue"  compared to just having one since kittenhood?
RIP all of your black clothes. Or even solid medium-tone clothes.

Heather grey is your new best friend.

(Wore tons of black, got a white cat. Met and married a man with another white cat. It‚Äôs worth it.)
Such a pretty kitty üíï thank you
I have two chubber bros I got from the local pound and wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. They like to eat just like me.

Did his tail get less fluffy?
she loves u!
Wow, what a huge difference, just so fat and happy! Makes me smile!
Your cat is so beautiful

What a beautiful and now very well loved kitty. ‚ô• Thank you for rescuing this cutie!
You‚Äôre a good dude. Cute lil kitty. 
Good for you, OP! That is one cute cat. 
That cat is going to have the time of its life from here on out. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thats a nice fucking kitty
Da pretty floof!!!
OP, I appreciate you and everything you do. Just by seeing the simple act of you doing this for another living being, I know you are truly a good human being.
I also adopted a kitty off the street in October, wish I had taken some better "before" photos. You are doing a great thing, she's a pretty kitty!! üòª
Beautiful kitty! You're a good person for taking her in. üòä

Its hard to believe that‚Äôs a street cat! What a fluffy baby <3
Wow, she is gorgeous! Amazing what care and feeding does to an animal. You‚Äôre her hero!
She has amazing eyes. That's a really beautiful cat.
Thank you Alina !
The cat is looking good. You did a good thing for the cat. I hope the cat lives a long healthy life. 
We had a cat that looked exactly like him when I was a kid! My mom found him hiding under a truck in a parking lot one day, the truck was a Chevy, so you can guess what name we gave him
The world needs more people like you OP
They truly have ascended into their final form :) beautiful 
You turned the feather into a cotton ball. 
Isa cutie
One time, i met a cat on the road. He was the cutest thing, but im allergic, so i thought i‚Äôd leave him alone. But this lil old lady came up to him and fed him some mcdonalds fries and it was the cutest thing. I love seeing people help cats
That beautiful face ‚ù§Ô∏è
She's gorgeous.
Such a beautiful cat :)
I just screenshot this. Planning to use as an inspiration.  I am a small entrepreneur and this photo proves how if given enough care and time things can hugely improve. 
I'm trying to adopt a stray kitty too. It's a few months old now, recently weaned off the mom. Yesterday was the first time she let me touch her and it felt really rewarding. She's a little scared of humans because most of them here keep shooing strays away.

I'm feeling more inspired by your post!

Also I've named her (or him) Tux, short for Tuxedo. Black and white. 
Every time I see this type of thing it makes me cry with joy, you‚Äôve changed a life in unimaginable ways. Thank you!
Good for you
Wow. She is so beautiful! What a gorgeous baby and good on you for giving her love ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Aaaaahhhh, it's so adorable!!!!!
Wow, she is so beautiful!! 
Thats a really pretty cat.
Hmm not all heroes wear cape <3
She is beautiful! Looks like she did a good job chosing you to be her person!
From white cat to white CUTE! fur ballüòçüòç
My parents took in one of our cats off the streets. This cat looks a lot like her. She also turned into a beautiful white fluff. Your kitty looks so happy. ‚ù§Ô∏è
You rock.
I think she‚Äôs a cat angel.. 
She is gorgeous!
She has beautiful fur
Wow, incredible looking cat! Thank you for rescuing. :)
FLOOOOOFFYYYYYY
Oh my god I can't stand how pretty this cat is. <3
Thank you, OP!! All of my babies of the past 8 years have been street rescues, and I love seeing others.

Sweet baby angel!!!
Aww, so clean and fluffy and the eyes are telling me he's starving to death and I was halfway to getting up to get some food. 
Such a beauty
Oh wow!!!!!!! 
Looking so beautiful and healthy!

She's beautiful!  She sure gained a lot of weight in a month!  Her coat looks very healthy!
You're beautiful! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Awe she/he is so cute omg
Truly amazing man. Wishing a long happy life to that kitty
She is beautiful! What a treat to the world. Thanks for saving her.
I literally said aww without realizing the subreddit this was from. So did my boyfriend. Great post, OP
Ah, this makes me so happy. You are that cat's hero! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you for caring enough to to take a stray in.
You will receive so much love and joy from that cat . I know I do from my stray cat.
Adorable! She is a really beautiful kitter :)
she was really really gorgeous! She looks like our cat :) a really pleasing eyes and it will make you more relax .. awwwwww
Tbh you rescued a unicorn! Such a beautiful bb
She's gorgeous!
You did a very good job with that kitty glo-up there. Kitty looks happy and pampered now. üòç
That's one happy looking cat in the 'after' picture.  I can tell she is being well taken care of and loved just by the cat's expression in the picture alone. 

Hats off to you, sir.
is she deaf?
Gorgeous!
That is a good looking kitty.
Are you near Canberra? That is my cats doppelganger. He's missing.
[deleted]
She is a little beauty alright. I rescued a little kitten in 2006 in Ukraine at  -20 degrees C. She was alsot this skinny. When I let her in she went straight to the kitchen to the trash. When I found her she was chowing down on potato peelings with gusto. I lost her last week she was 12. I promised her that she would never be hungry again. I kept my promise to my little Harley girl. 
Why does the left kitty has a bushier tail and different eye color pattern than the right one? 
I‚Äôm not religious really but this is doing God‚Äôs work. 
She's white, so make sure she avoids too much direct sun. I think I remember that can be dangerous for white cats.
Would be wholesome if i didnt notice the fur color was different and so was the eye color, theres no point lying about these things.
You're a good human. People like you keep this world together :-)
[deleted]
That‚Äôs some unhealthy weight gain ....
In 2 more months you cam post it on absolute units 
Looks like it could do with some exercise.
That cat hit the cat lottery.
Yayüíúüíôüñ§üíôüñ§‚ù§Ô∏èüß°üñ§üíúüß°
Why do the eyes look like different colors
What made him change colour?
Was this cat shaved at some point? If not, what de-floofs their fur like that? Why is the tail less floofy in the second photo? I have so many questions, I own four cats and the species is still a mystery to me!
Please stop giving OP a hard time by saying it's not the same cat!  She deserves blessings for rescuing this cat.  Camera angle and lighting make a huge difference,  and you can clearly see the before pic was taken outside before she took her in.  As for her tail, a bigger,  fatter kitty makes the tail look smaller. 
Those are not the same cat. The ears, eyes, and tail are all different. The cats are gorgeous, but they are not the same.
How the hell did it turn yellow?
From ‚Äúwhisper-thin‚Äù to ‚Äúa fine chonk‚Äù in only one month
Sweet angels, both of you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I like to think her pupils are more dilated in the second pic because she‚Äôs happier, even though I know it‚Äôs down to lighting
Obviously two different cats. If the tail didn't give it away for you, the left one has more vibrant colors and a more narrow face structure.

I'm all for good stories, just not lies. If this is true, prove it with more pics. (OP Won't deliver).

Edit: Looks like I'm wrong; sorry. Pretty unbelievable transformation.
What kind of cat is she? She is beautiful.
CHONK
Nothing better than a slightly fat cat.
I just found a cat yesterday who seems to be about in similar shape. What did you do to help the weight gain process?
kitty looks very healthy and happy.  :-D
B  . E  . A. Utiful!
It turned yellow, what the hell did you feed it?!?! Btw your a good human
Floof power activate! 
So much floof! 
Anyone know what breed she is?
WOW GORGEOUS

What a beautiful baby you saved üíú
 She is absolutely beautiful! Just wondering If you have had the damage to her right eye check out by a vet? 
I think you may have just stolen someone‚Äôs outdoor cat. Which is fine with me honestly. 
Gonna need some ink to go with that quill
Beautiful glamour shots. The fur as white as snow. That tail is gorgeous in the first photo.
What a beauty

Who would abandon a beauty like that? All cats are beautiful but that tail! Magnificent!

Beautiful eyes, thank you so much for helping this sweetheart! 
On a quest to become an absolute unit!
She looks so much healthier!!
I wish I had -before- pictures of my boi's. They're super healthy now, but were skinny as heck and matted a bit when their person had to let them go because she wasn't going to get out of the hospital anytime soon. 
Great that it worked out for you. We have quite a selection of cats to choose from outside my place in Columbus, OH.
PRECIOUS FLOOF
What a beautiful cat.
Always nice to see. Great job dude, she looks healthy and happy

I love it! Also r/progresspics would love to see your Kitty's bulking progress üí™
That jawline tho
She is beautiful. Rescue cats can be a box of hammers. You never know if they will hit exactly what you need them to.
From fungus to chungus
Those eyes are gorgeous!
damn, she is way to gorgeous to be on the street. 
Turkish van. Beautiful!
That‚Äôs an insanely beautiful cat
You saved that cats life. I mean, maybe it would have survived. But now the cat can have a comfortable, low stress life.
People should get Civic Awards for this. Townships should hand out nice little framed certificates for maybe little bronze medals.
How do you keep a grown cat as your own?  We‚Äôve had some cats come hang out with us at our house but they never seemed to consider it their home. Just a place to be when they felt like it. They would leave and go elsewhere or their home. So in that sense I wonder how hard it is to ‚Äúadopt‚Äù a cat because according to the cat, maybe it won‚Äôt consider your home its home?
The thic fluff of joy
What an absolute beauty,safe and loved üíú
Pure whites have a tendency to be def. So just be careful, my sister used to have one and would scare the cat when approaching the cat from behind.
So pretty, I need to touch.
Well done! This may be a stupid question, but did you check to make sure she has all of her shots and what not?
I got bit :(
Absolute beaut 
All of the fluff went from its tail to its body lol!
Gorgeous
KITTY
Cat now yellow
Beautiful rescue from the street. 
even their before pic was beautiful. my lord.
Absolutely wonderful that you've turned this cat's life around. Be mindful of rule #1 though.
She looks so sweetüíúüíú
She turned more yellow? 
You adopted a squirrel and ended up with a fat cat. 
Aww! Sweet but crazy white kitties. I love em‚Äô.
Cat: loves you for saving it from a hard life on the streets, hates you for existing. 
he/she looks fantastic.
Pretty hairy baby!!

That's Momma cat!!   We did the same thing, same cat, one month later she gave birth.  Called her Momma cat for the next 9 years, and Scraggle Tooth for another 3 years after that.  

Take good care of her, and thanks for dredging up the memories.
awww, so adorable 
She kinda reminds me of Elizabeth ther 3rd  (Mystic Messenger) except the green eyes.   
That cat is hotter then me

Hope he's the best boy :-) I miss my Whitey dearly
Such a beautiful cat!
Looking for #10yr challenge
Overweight?
Look how pink that nose and those ears got! I'm no doctor but surely that is a good sign of health not to mention look how well her eyes healed! Awesome job!
My mum had a totally white cat, lived for 22 years, it was deaf as a post, totally white cats apparently always have some sort of a problem, eyes and hearing are the two that the vet told us, she could hear when she was a kitten, but after about 2 years she was deaf, deaf but still had the fastest claws in the west, she had the softest fur I have ever felt to this day.
Aww!! He‚Äôs so chunky now!
That there's a hefty boy!

At this rate the kitty will need to go on a diet by next month.
Wow

Beeeehhbbbeeeehhh

You're awesome! It's your floofster deaf?
Beautiful!
Free cat
That looks like the cat that swallowed the stray cat whole...
In pic 1, if the sides of that cat were black I‚Äôd have thought it a skunk
Hey! Being fat is my job!
You should try to sell these photos to a cat protein supplement company, they would pay a lot most likely. 
Turkish angora huh. Beautiful.
Amazing!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

1.0 year challenge

Make sure you take it to the vet to check for parasites
Gorgeous cat.  Thank you for caring.
That cat was too fancy for the street. You did the right thing. 
OMG... that looks like a whole diffrent cat!!!! 
U did good taking care of him/her
Turkish Angoras are a very expensive breed. In the US people steal these cats. They also do very well in shows along with Persians, rag dolls, and Maine Coons.
So fluff
Even after all this I bet that cat still wants to kill you. I can see it in its eyes. 
It turned into floof
man i really hate when people abandon animals or don't treat them right.  They were basically 'made' to be companions/workers and rely on people for care.  People who treat them poorly just really don't take this into account, and it's very unfair and tragic.
How did you get the cat to trust you? I tried to take in a street cat like that and it wanted nothing to do with me. 
What a beauty!! 
oh WOW 
Make sure you get it some kind of toy or laser pointer it can chase around. Cats need to run around every day! 
Crazy cool eyes
Absolutely beautiful!
Ya done good, op
What a drop dead gorgeous little lady ^^ s l a y
That‚Äôs awesome 
V good fluuf

You are such a good hearted men
I need a nice lady to do this for me .
WHAT A BEAUTY
Also those fur discolorations could have been from malnutrition, don't see that in the new coat, great job!
Hell ya.
She apparently was hiding another  25 lb cat in there, waiting to officially adopt you as her human before she let you know that your food bill would be double what it was when you got her, but well worth the costüôÇ
Gorge!!  
Asami Sato? Dat you?
Lovely fluffer! Well done!

What a pretty floof ball! Congratulations on your new pet you did a good thing rescuing it. Here's a great [onion article](https://www.theonion.com/like-boxes-of-shit-in-your-house-get-a-cat-1819586403?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=theonion_copy&utm_campaign=top) on the joy of cats.
This makes me happy 
This is why rescuing is important. I adore you for this. 
the floof migrated from his/her tail to the rest of her body.
I wish something like this would happen to me.
1 month?!?!?!?!?! 



Wow
So fluffy!  She looks so happy and healthy. 
So pretty! Good cat! 
Whenever I try to rescue a cat, it hisses and runs away. :(
Did you take him to your grandma's house?
Proof that all it takes is some love 
You my sir are a god 
The Floofining.
Fl≈´f
Your cat looks just like my cat. I honestly thought it was my cat for a second. 
She is so cute and chubby !!! 
My lord what a beauty.
Oh my, what a beauty! 
Look at that face! She's a model
The month of December was hard for all of us 
Some pets are more aesthetically pretty than people
SO PRETTY
Looks almost ready to harvest for the fancy feast. 
I know.  My stray was so small, i thought she was a 6mo old kitten.  When I asked the vet how old she was, she said by thier dental exam, 4 to 5yrs.  I about hit the floor. My baby is now 11 or 12, and is a 13 pound beauty! 
Be careful feeding strays. When you rescue them they will eat more than should and most stray animals will get fat if you don‚Äôt limit their intake to normal
Never had a cat before. How does the cat treat you? Do you get special attention because you rescued it or do the overlords treat us they way they normally do?
But you painted it yellow
now that‚Äôs a gorgeous cat 
Aww

&#x200B;
One month fluff challenge 
She looks so much like my khaleesi... she came from the street & has had an epic glow up too 
She‚Äôs beautiful 
Good for you!!!
It's amazing what a good diet, warm bed, and not having to fear for your life every day will do for an animal.
Pretty ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Good on you! 
Damn boy he‚Äôs thicc
Beautiful
Why did it‚Äôs tail hair get shorter?
What a gorgeous little princess.
Lil' buskerton
WOW that cat is beautiful üòª
Very awesome 
This cat could be a model!
Wow. That's beautiful. 
Babykinssss!!
You are amazing. Thank you.
He turned yellow? 
Tbh i think the pic with her walking and the bigger tail is better.... isnt that the before?
Beautiful! Good job!!
Supermodel Cat!!!
You have a wonderful heart thank you. 
What a tail!
Pretty Kitty! üòä
Yup, you overfed that cat alright.
Damn, she's used to be all tail #jealous
R/chonkers
looks so much like my old cat Little Bit except she had a gray tail and the top of her head and ears were also gray
I'm glad to see she had no problem getting her weight back up.
From pauper to Queen. 
I want to reach through my computer screen and mother the first kitty.
From ragamuffin to super model in a month. 
Beuatiful Cat that‚Äôs awesome 
That's a lot of weight to gain in a month. I do hope it's more fur than fat, because if not, you should really be concerned about that. It's easy to pass off her gaining weight as a cute thing, but please be careful to not overfeed her.
Get that cat in a cat show. Whoa wtf 
Amazing what love and care will do! Beautiful!
His floof got transfered from his tail to his body 
Disney cat! She is beautiful! Look after her x
Wooooow! What a beautiful kitty!
That's a gorgeous transition 
Beautiful 
Washer vs dryer

But seriously good job you! Kitty friend looking good!
Floof
It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!!!
so over the course of a month you brushed her fur?
Kudos to you OP but I miss that tail in the shape of a quill.
You rescued a cat that the spitting image of my first kitty who was perfection in cat form. I hope your angel brings as much joy as mine did. Been gone for 28 years and I still miss her. Hope someday the universe see fit to sent me another white fluffy.
Great story, you have done well. 
what a pretty boy ‚ô•‚ô•
That is one gorgeous cat
The floof in her tail went to her body! 
Floooofs
The tail to cat ratio completely inverted
The tail in the first one though... 
Hey man, as a fellow long white hair cat owner, please don‚Äôt let her sit in the sun. My girl did and we had to remove the tips of her ears cause of carcinoma. Anyways, she beautiful. 
Megafloof
That is a majestic cat 
When you‚Äôre single versus 5 years into the relationship. 
What is their name, please! :))
Phat
Whatta loaf. 
Beautiful kitty! Looks like it should be a Pokemon
Looks like Yuki from The Cat Returns
That is a beautiful cat
That is some good quality ass right there. 
That kitty looks like somebody else‚Äôs kitty at one time. 
I dont know what you feeded her, but she got fluffier XD 
Wow what a lucky pussycat. Bet you it‚Äôs very happy and grateful.
Looks like the ice fox from Star Wars
what a beauty
So, so beautiful. I had the same, whie cat with fluffy fur and tail. Now he is gone. I miss him a lot. Take care of this precious! 
Hes a little chonker now
r/Supermodelcats
Wow beautiful kitty. 
He/She looks like the Tobi Kadachi from Monster Hunter... and looks fabulous :)
I rescued my cat about two months ago but he seems to be losing weight. I think he might need his teeth pulled. But the vet says it‚Äôll be $1500. :( and I‚Äôm on sick leave right now from work with peptic ulcers. It makes me sad. 
Those ears are so pink!
She transfered her tail fur onto her body X) 
It has a squirrel tail on the first pic
That's crazy his eyes changed color
quicc to thicc 30 day challange
a good little poof
Eva Gabor reincarnated?
I like to think that my cat is a tsundere to make me feel better about the fact that my cat hates affection
When a cat is prettier than you smh
ThanQ!
Question--was this in China?  I rescued a scroungy looking cat off the street in China--I thought she was going to be yellow and white and she also turned into a snow white princess and looks just like this.  
He got T H I C C
he is even more cute now!
Thank you for rescuing.
What a floof ball!!
Thats a nice fu**ing kittie right there
Thats a nice fucking kittie right there
Thats one nice kittie right there
That floof is one nice fu**ing kittie right there.
that cat is so beautiful! glad to see it living in better circumstances.
Thicc cat now
Thankooo kind hooman
Almost ready to eat.
Are the dark patches of fur in the first pic dirt or dark hair? Especially in the tail
Now _this_ is a glow up

Kudos to you OP but I miss that tail in the shape of a quill.
Very beautiful lady

How did she change the eye color
How did the eyes color change??
You stole a cat off the street *
r/supermodelcats needs to see this gorgeous baby!
The cat on the right ate the one on the left?
r/disneyeyes
Not to fat shame your cat but I genuinely like the look of the left one better. The for coloration, the slink, the eyes that say "I've seen some shit man, just let me in for the night, two weeks max."
OC? I think not.
how did it become so yellow?
Smoking doesn't just stain teeth lol
you turned him yellow.
That's funny, my tag of you as "karma farming russian" that I gave you last time you posted your nonsense "before/after" with two different cats was missing. 
Its still amazing how cat gets more sympathy than any human. There are tons of posts I see on reddit about ppl rescuing cats every single day and its pointless in a way as they can survive on their own. What about the ppl who are victims of rigged system and are not able to afford basic human needs or just food. Hypocrisy is ppl sharing with whole world how they saved an animal from the street and dont get me wrong I support this and its good that you are saving a soul from harshness of the world but I highly doubt that any person survivng on the the streets will get the same response. 
wow it got so skinny. Are you feeding her at all???
You abducted a cat from it's family and home and put it in your home??
A month later: r/Chonkers
r/supermodelcats
r/progresspics
Beautiful!
I swear ive seen this at least 2 other times on here.
Jeez, do you feed it pure meatballs with a side of extra more meatballs? 
Overweight
she was whiter what r u black people doing???
ah a part 2 of violating rule #1
Not a feral cat. 
Looks like an abandoned or lost cat
He looked cooler before
It is yellow now...
Now she‚Äôs yellow 
Don‚Äôt give a shit
The eyes are different
How you know you "rescued" her? Just because she looks better now to the human eye? Maybe she enjoyed the life on the streets? Typical "good" human.
She was healthier back then. I would know, I'm a fitness guru
Looked better before
