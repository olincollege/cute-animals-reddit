Raccoons are always so cute yet so devilish at times
That little bandit is just waiting for the UPS guy and he's going to steal the package that's left at the door.
Trash Pandicoot
Guy looks like he's behind the bar.
During the year do some decorating on that brick, paint it like a bar and craft some bottles and put them on top. Hope he comes back next year
Get your own bunker asshole.  
He looks pretty young.  Too little to be away from his mom. I hope his momma found him.  
Save the little trash pandas from the booms.  Oml he is so precious 😭
Poor little guy looks terrified!!
We have a bunch on campus this time of year and I counted 5 last night hanging around, hiding behind and hiding in a dumpster out back during the fireworks show. The squirrels were no where to be seen either, so I assume they were all hunkering down in bushes somewhere.
Raccoon has wares, if you have coin
Someone Photoshop a little military helmet on this lil guy
A friend's dog escaped from the yard and was having an obnoxious time eluding capture, refusing to come when called, generally being an annoying PITA.

Then somebody a few houses down set off something that had a really loud boom. Dog sprinted back home as fast she she could.

From now on, any time a dog runs away I'm going to use that as an excuse to blow something up. From my sample size of one it works perfectly every time.
Give him 3,000 Bells and he'll add a room to your house. 
WHERES THE GARAGE RACOON GUY I feel like he needs to see this...
Awww, poor Little King Trashmouth
I mean, I've watched my dog the last few years play the "WTF is going on" with the fireworks, but at least he has a house to run back inside to. Can you imagine all the animals outside every year experiencing the fourth?
My cousin once had a pet raccoon. My family and his found it in a culvert when I was in 5th grade (2004). He was very nearly drowned. My cousin was the only one who dared pick him up, and he did get bit, but we took it back to our house and dried him off. He was pretty much in a cage for the first several months. But after that, he was basically a dog. He didn't play fetch but he loved going on car rides and listening to this [song](http://kalc.radiotown.com/audio/SmashMouth-AllStar.mp3). He would eat most leftovers too. He had to give him away after a year but it was a really interesting year to say the least.
It looks like it's in the middle of the day in this picture.... what part of the country didn't get the 'you do fireworks at nighttime' memo? 
I hate fireworks for this reason and a few more
Lmao I just signed up for Reddit and this was the first post I've seen, not disappointed. 
He looks so scared... You just want to walk up to him and hug him and tell him that he doesn't have to be scared and that everything will be alright... But you can't because he's scared of you too and everything you do only makes him more scared. :(
Raccoons aren't afraid of fireworks! They collect them and build rocket launchers with them, and join the guardians of the fricken galaxy!
I feel so bad for animals on the 4th. We walked back to the AirBnB last night after the fireworks show and saw a giant lab who looks like Falkor running wild wimpering in his backyard. We had a pretty good group of us and luckily he was friendly. When we called him over, he jumped on the hedge bush and received pets from everyone in the group trying to calm him down. He was still whimpering a little bit as more fireworks went off from random people all over town, but at least he seemed a tiny bit less stressed about it while getting pets.
He is going to give you a quest to do
I feel yah, bro. 

I had a dog tumor on my leg all day yesterday until around 2am. I might as well have surgically attached him because that's what it felt like.


Please don't take that Raccoon for granite
This is a common problem for wildlife rehabbers. Sad to say fireworks and animals don't mix well. Parents often get scared and separated from their babies. Ones that can't keep up sometimes get left behind, with all that is going on they get even more lost trying to find a place to hide. Many domestic animals go missing as well. 

Don't get me wrong, I love fireworks. However, I've seen the tole it takes on animals and think that having cities put on the shows as opposed to everyone shooting them off at their own home is the best option.
Dude has his owm barricade up and ready for battle.
Ah recognise them anywhere - it's a haggis! If ye set a trap and leave a wee dram ay whiskey and a tiny wee bit ay shortbreed, the wee 3 legged monster will walk right in there. Ye've got a braw supper on yer porch richt there. Wee fuckers.
Just a reminder Raccoons are cute but are vary much still wild animals. I've lived in the country for about 5 years now and have had to NFL punt no fewer than 5 Raccoons who were try to attack my farm cats
That is the cutest little trash panda I have ever 
Free him
Been searching for him since 99 thieving, 120m experience now and i still cant find him. Damn you Rocky!
I think you mistaken. This is "Soon..." If I've ever seen it before
Say what you will, but thats a very good defensible position. 
Has Michael Scott's Dunder Mifflin Scranton Meredith Palmer Memorial Celebrity Rabies Awareness Pro-Am Fun Run Race for the Cure not done anything to prevent people from going near these vicious animals?!?!?!?!?
Hey, you there! I need your prosthetic leg. 
Ah the daytime fireworks
Shit I would do the same. It sounded like bombs were going off last night. Never heard the signature *whistle* they make when they shoot into the sky. At some point they rumbled my chest.

But god damn was it beautiful
When racoons get on the porch mama just sweep em away with a broom
He is way cute
Other than raccoon hideout, what is the large block for?
Guess that raccoon didn't like rockets, lol.
What a little precious!!
I've never seen a raccoon :-( we don't get them here in the UK
That trash panda is up to no good. He/she was probably in the middle of trying to find the extra set of house keys you left under that rock. 
He looks grumpy. "These damn kids these days."
But it's light outside, how are there fireworks?
How come fireworks during the day time?? Hmm..
Shouldn't light fireworks on the porch, might set the structure on fire...
the fireworks happening in the daylight???? 🤔
I saw a bunny shaking on the lawn looking up at the sky in terror lol. My mom said I could bring him in and put him in the tub cause my bathroom is really quiet but he ran away. I feel so bad for the critters during fireworks people should have more silent ones!
Poor little guy..

Did you feed him OP?

You should really not light fireworks on the front porch. Get farther away from the house for safety.
were the fireworks on the front porch, or did you find him on the porch?
Why human so loud when happy?

I would do the same thing in that scenario too. Fireworks terrify me.
Awwwwww

Great, PETA is going to start working to ban fireworks to make sure no animals feel any stress!
I like how he got behind a concrete blast shield. 
Cute little trash panda.  Glad you showed him some kindness on a scary night for all animals in the USA.

When you try to argue on the internet about something that's not a popular opinion. 
Looks like it is still daylight...
Hiding from the fireworks in broad daylight?
The look of *is it safe yet*
I know this is the wrong sub to be posting this, but damn, I shoot every trash panda I see.  besides the fact that they fuck up every trashcan or bird feeder in sight, they'll kill your fucking cats if they get hungry enough.  first time i shot a coon they were trying to kill my neighbor's kitten that i was watching for her.

hate em.  
Great picture. Poor little guy. He looks scared. Love his bandit eyes.

Don't go near a racoon if you see it during day time hours, it probably has rabies.

Awww, is he a baby or just tiny?
Reminds me of one of those little turds from Halo that would yell "We're gonna Die!"
A trash panda!
Ridiculously CUTE!
That could have ended very bad for you. Raccoons don't like to be cornered, and it's clear this one was already in distress.
So your front porch is made of asphalt?

He looks upset
And here I was thinking that raccoons were basically fearless.
Aww, so precious, looks like a puppy!
Aww. Poor little buddy.
Looks so depressed

I once had a friendly raccoon who would often visit my backyard.It was very cute so I didn't really see it as a threat. He was actually scouting out my fish pond which kinda sucked.

I love it when these posts make me actually say "aww"
That'll be 300,000 bells.

I love how half of his face looks cute and the other half looks sinister.

They're so cute I hate it :'(

Keep him and put him in your garage

I was the guardian of my parent's cats last night.
I felt so bad last night watching all these little animals fleeing for refuge. A pack of deer wondered through our area looking sketched the fuck out. 
From the thumbnail i thought it was your pet rock taking refuge

Fireworks look cool but I always think about how terrified wild animals must be over it.
Oh my goodness! As a "pet" racoon owner,  meaning,  I'm the pet of a racoon,  poor little love!  He needs some yogurt and some yummy coonola!
That face! 😡
Aww so cute, give him some food jeez, he's being put through a man-made hell. 
Just a coon moving brick on the corner. Nothing to see here.
Poor thing
Congratulations on your new porch panda.
Are racoons dangerous? 
Cute 
How figgin' cute!!!
"Your authority is not recognized in...Fort Kickass!"
Nope, we can't fire works anymore, we can't afford sad pictures like this on the internet :( think of the racoon! Look at him, he's totally pissed D':
My dog skipped going outside from 3pm until the booms subsided at 1am. 

She wasn't panicked or anything, she just did NOT want any of that shit.

Looks like he's just setting up the corner bar.
I acknowledge that this is cute and I apologize this reply is wittier or more lighthearted, but it blows my mind how much humans fuck up their environments/ecosystems without even realizing it. This is not shit that trash pandas evolved to deal with
Aww your new trash panda can be named rocket 
Nice doggo
Hope you have no chickens or any other fowl near by these guys are ruthless!
I never thought a racoon post could make it to the front page without being referred to as a "trash panda". What a breath of fresh air this is.

Another ad by Big Raccoon! I won't fall for it 
Poor lil trash panda!
Looks like Rocket woke with a hangover
Addressing the OP.  May I be so bold as to inquire on the purpose of a large rectangular slab of granite on your front/back porch that this raccoon appears to be using as some form of cover.  
Who knew trauma could look so cute. That was basically me behind my car when a firework misfired. 
actually i think the raccoon is trying to steal that big block and looks upset because you are not helping it to carry the big block back to his home because you know for raccoon reasons.
He needs a snuggle.
Weird looking cat. 
Omg it's so cute

Good thing you installed the hiding rocks.
Awe...Never even thought of those critters!!  My dogs don't like them either!!
pretty effective cover actually
This is why fireworks are horrible for animals wild and domestic
!!!!!!!!!
Yes, fireworks during the day. Logical. 
In his defense you shouldn't light fireworks on a porch
Adorable!
I feel you little buddy. 
There's a guy in my town that rides around with 3 raccoons in a truck, it's crazy when you pull up next to a raccoon hanging out the passenger window.
Why does it look like daylight tho 
I felt the same way.
Lol
Lol
Fucking love raccoons hahaha they're just so adorable
OP is clearly just trying to start his or her own garage racoon family.
You know, as terrifying as the 4th of july is for my dogs, I can't imagine what it must be like for wild animals that are probably freaking the fuck out because of it.

In my neighborhood I imagine they all flock to the trees and the low creek bed down the block where it's probably a lot quieter, but some animals probably have no easy place to go hide except for wherever they sleep.
“What kind of name is Taserface!”
How in the world did he get that big chunk of granite out of the ground and carry it up onto your deck?  That's the real story here.
Who tf has fireworks in the daylight?
Advice 50¢
Poor Trash Panda, he looks concernedI hope. OP: what happened to him? Did mom find him? If not, he'd make an excellent bartender. 
Holy crap that is adorable. 
Ahahahahahaah it's a giraffe!!
Man, animals are better prepared for war than most humans.

July 4th is fun for us but it sucks for animals :/ 
Quick, someone get him some earmuffs!
Uhh, but it's daytime in this photo..
Is that Mt. Airy granite? Looks like it came from the world's largest open-faced doorstop quarry.

edit: I've now seen OP's response (and post history) indicating he lives in the Seattle area which makes this even more of a mystery. As far as I can tell, white granite is not indigenous to the area and there are only a handful of quarries that yield granite that looks like this (Mt. Airy, NC being one of them). I'm really interested to know where this hunk o' rock came from.
Adopt it
That’s definitely not Rocket Raccoon.
So cute!
Why do people think racoons are cute? They're very mean animals.

When life gives you lemons...






Teach a raccoon to make lemonade.
Reddit has taught me to fear Raccoons out at day time like the plague. 
You also feed the thing. Probably doesn't help
Yeah the best time to shoot fireworks is during the day 
Ask him if he knows Rocket. 
Please someone add an army helmet and a machine gun! 
And that's why we didn't use raccoons at Normandy. 
Just an FYI racoons that are out in the day time are not always sick. Sometimes it's momma racoon snatching food for the babies
Awe
Lighting fireworks on the front porch, I see you like to live dangerously
I want to pet them but I'm afraid they're rabid
A good day for the humans, a bad day for the animals-can't be helped I suppose 
That's probably dangerous to do fireworks on your front porch
Adorable!!
this refugee raccoon apparently didnt get the memo for trumps travel ban

Awww poor lil guy, has no clue what the hell is happening
That one is a baby :( I wonder if the fireworks scared him away from his nest 
That might be the cutest thing ever. 
That shit would maul you in a second, especially when cornered. 


You guys start fireworks during broad daylight?  I thought everyone waited until dusk at least
Why were you setting off fireworks on the front porch
This is clearly Rocket getting ready to make his next move

AWW.
Much cuter than the scream bark my dog was entertaining me with after each firework. 
Fuck that's cute
How is this post the top? I will try to take a cute picture of my dog and see how far it goes.
Real real awwwww!
I'm thinking maybe it's mother had something happen to her.  This little guy should be with his mother during the first year of his life.  Somehow, he got separated.
3, 2, 1...d'awwwwww!!
He looks old
Looks like he's just trying to sell you a mortgage.
That lil cutie has the weirdest fuck off look in his eyes
I came in here prepared to say "aww" but then actually looked at the picture and he looks like a GRUMP.
War is hell
He has an item behind that block that he wants to give you. You need it to complete an epic quest. Do not disappoint him. 
I think raccoons are really cute, but can't get my family on board since one got in a fight with our dog and tore him up pretty good. 
We had another one visit and blew my mind how smart they are. This one opened a cooler that was left out. It had a bottle of water in it along with a Ziploc full of flour. (Son uses bags of flour for target practice.) This raccoon opens the bag of flour and pours just enough water to make a paste. Puts the lid back on the bottle, and made a "finger painting" with the flour paste on our driveway. Then put everything back in the cooler and closed the lid like nothing happened. It was so meticulously done, if the prints in the paste weren't obviously a raccoon's, I would have thought my son was pulling a prank. 
I guess you authority is not recognized in fort Brickass.
Why are there fireworks on your porch? 
I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine!
Looks like he might be luring some children In for some treats
 I keep coming back to this. That little face!

I get it, Trash Panda.  I feel the same way.
I honestly don't believe you.
He's trying to blend in with the decor. 
It's like a war zone this will be great cover... oh noes I'm now a camper.
Aww poor thing, he looks terrified! 
Really cute, but I doubt the "refuge from the fireworks" bit. The light level and blurry shadow say this is daylight.
Fuck raccoons.
This kinda brings out the inner PETA within me because I can't imagine how terrified all the animals must be. Lots of animals are terrified of thunder already- imagine how much worse fireworks must scare them. 

Especially in that previous post overlooking a city showing how frequent fireworks were going off
poor trash panda....
He's cute, not as cute as the nurse that gives rabies injections, but still pretty cute
I've never felt so emotionally attached to a raccoon in my life.
That's not a raccoon, it's an Ewok

Right... because fireworks go off in broad daylight. 
Dawww
he is real thug 
My dog has never heard fireworks before, so when he heard a loud BOOM outside our house, he booked it to my room and slid under my bed, despite the face that he is to big to fit. 
Naw :( Since learning how scary fireworks are for wildlife I don't like fireworks anymore.

You're not supposed to light fireworks on your front porch.

Is that dude from Galaxy something
"Insert quote from shitty gardians of the Galaxy movie"
I question the "intelligence" study my friend.  There are MANY factors at play in every situation.  I adopted a yellow lab that was smarter than I am who shivered in fear if I popped my gum, surely because of some former abuse.  And, many of my fellow Iraq & Afghanistan veteran friends and I struggle through fireworks every year.  For instance, last night was a nightmare for me privately in my apartment.  I doubt my neighbor's goldfish or hamster struggled through that experience for hours like I did, and I'm probably more highly intelligent then they are since I'm a graduate of two universities.  As far as animal species go, raccoons and dogs aren't exactly at the bottom of the "intelligence" list my friend, and neither are small children, of which almost all are petrified naturally.

Hmmmmm, fireworks during the daytime... Yeah I'm not buying the title.

Raccoons get no love. I have raccoons around my apartment complex, and whenever I tell my family / show them pictures,  they're like "Eww, they're nasty and dangerous!"

Yeah, OK...
