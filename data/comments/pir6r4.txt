What a noble little dude!
Someone knows they are the most important person there.
He will conduct the duties of his office with dignity
"It was about time the threw this whole party for me" \~Cat
Distinguished gentleman
Such a regal guy. Good day sir.
I bear the rings, but I also bear unbearable hatred for all in here. 


*You may be amazed.*
Original pic credit needs to go to my new brother-in-law @larsonrichard on Twitter
Idk, the ring bearer looks like him might speak up when the officiant asks if anyone objects to this marriage.  😳
Aww! He looks so professional and yet cuddly!
attn: r/catswithjobs
The ring? Oh the ring...is under the fridge with all my other toys. I'm just here to look fabulous. Push me human. 

Super impressive cat, love him.
Ring bearer's mission was to push a cat down the isle.
That sweet cat is so dapper...
Is his name in the wedding program? Who is pushing his chariot down the isle? Are the rings in his tux pocket? I need answers! 

🥺 He is so cute!
I bet he had to buy that tux too, not rent.
"Be a good lad, bring me to Crumbs & Whiskers, I have a date to impuress.."
This cat looks like a spokesperson of all the other cats
> I can't carry it for you, Mr. Catto, but I *can* carry you
What type of cat is that. Is it a …tuxedo cat?

I’ll see myself out.
I may not know precisely what is going on, but I sure know how to be important.
He looks like he's been waiting for this day his whole life
What. Is. His. Name?
The Lord of The Ring
That is one handsome cat!
Behold The Mighty Moose!!
Here comes the cat!
"Speak now or forever hold your paws"

💍
*sigh* These affairs of state can be so droll but the peasants who adore me need to be inspired and humbled by the annexation of a human caregiver ceremony lest they forget their place.
I will take the ring down the aisle, though I do not know the way.
Look at this distinguished gentleman. Look at the way he is sitting. Yessss very distinguished.
He will do it. He will bring the ring to Mordor.
That cat fucked my wife
Ah, shit I wish I thought of this! 😭
So determined to make a good ring bearer 🥺 my old boy would’ve clawed his way out of there the moment he was placed in it
Make way for Frodo the ring bearer and his companion Sam!
Omg stop it! Lmao so cute
That cat looks like he's disappointed in me and what hurts the most is that he's right.
Wow. That’s a good looking groom!
That cat fills out a suit better than I ever will.
I’d take him as ring bearer over a human boy any day of the week, and twice on Sunday. He’d probably do a way better job. He’s perfectly dressed for the occasion, and he is obviously taking his job very seriously. Plus, he’s super adorable! 😊
I'm Feline his dedication!
[deleted]
Mordor, here we come.
Is that the baron?
He looks like He would have a royal british accent or a french accent
His little tux is so damn cute!!! I love this!
Okay, but when is the Ring Bear arriving?
Look at this distinguished gentleman 🎩
Looks ready to blast off into the bushes the second the screen door is unzipped.
Meow that's Fancy, Festive and Fun
ok but when do we get to see the footage of the clumsy misstep that misplaced the ring out of the chapel, which leads to a wild goose chase to retrieve the ring alongside his smaller sidekick until they both return to the altar out of breath and just in time for the exchange of rings.
He kind of looks mad that you’re marrying his girl
He must take the ring to mount Doom.
That is a gentleman and a scholar kitty
Oh so that's how you get a cat to be a ring bearer.
I think r/catswithjobs would love this!
The best boy!! I love him, please give him extra kisses from me —- and congratulations!  Seems as though you’re winning on all fronts xx
He looks like he takes his responsibility very seriously. What a gorgeous boy😻
He looks so proud to carry out this important duty for his mom and dad!💕😻
Is he available for other weddings ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
I hope he sounds like Aslan when he deliver's his speech.
Do we bow to him? I feel like bowing when he passes by and deliberately ignores my desire for recognition.
Have a great day Mr!
In my country, I think interspecies marriage is now illegal.
All Hail The Great Cat Master that will ceremoniously anoint the joining of his hooman slaves

ALL HAIL THE GREAT CAT MASTER!!!!

Blessing to the hoomans he deems worthy of union
I just finished watching The Cat Returns. Cute.
More photos please 💘
This is the best The Ring Bearer ever <3
Mr. Paws-a-tively Handsome!
This is what I imagine it would look like if you invite Hannibal Lecter to your wedding.
I said good day sir!
Oh he KNOWS he’s important here
What an absolute gentleman
Cat : 

"Mr Robert please bring the stroller out front , I have a important job to do "
Bride and Groom: we’ve decided to appoint you as our ring bearer at our wedding!

Cat: (deadpan response) I don’t do weddings…

Bride and Groom: are you sure we can’t change your mind?

Cat: I…I...I’m really not comfortable in crowds.

Bride and Groom: we can help you feel more comfortable. And look! We got you an outfit!

Cat: that looks disgusting ( begins looking away disinterested)

Bride and Groom: (shows cat netted baby stroller) and we got you your own personal vehicle!

Cat: that looks like a prison

Bride and Groom: we‘ll get you all the catnip you want afterwards

Cat: you’ve got me for 2 hours, tops!
Kitty is satisfied. Plan has worked. Dumb sad crying human has wife now. Kitty was cute and cuddly so she would fall for him. Wife will care for dumb human so he will feed me and I continue my plotting for world domination.
F

![gif](giphy|lE5u6gdLEXA9W|downsized)
Clearly not if he is in kitty jail.
Handsome but that side eye is a bit shady
That’s the most cat looking bear I’ve ever seen
What a distinguished gentleman
He the sharpest in the whole ceremony!!!
what a distinguished gentleman
“Hi, plebeyos”
That is darling
This is F-ing fantastic material!
Love his confident face
😀 what a distinguished gentleman
Well look at this distinguished gentlemen!
goddamn thats one hella fine boi
Funny because I have 2 cats named Frodo and Sam

Ring Bearer

Ohh you meant wedding
One does not simply walk into Mordor.
What a dapper young fellow!
what a royal looking cat
It looks like a  noble prince.
But who is ring bearer, bearer?
Obviously the most important member of the wedding party
Very distinguished gentleman
It also seems as tho he's trapped, but it doesn't seem to mind that either lol
That is one handsome and dashing sir
Looks like he is there to hand out requests as godfather
“Congratulations and I hate every single one of you.”
Oh he serious about his job!
Give me a sense of ceremony
 Now this is fine living. That cat is a smooth dapper don!
Cat People = Crazy people
For some reason it makes me think of Hannibal Lecter on the trolley

His ascot and bow-tie are everything, OML 😍
What a beautiful cat. I can not. So cute.

If your or my wedding is not like this - do not even think of calling me there
Handsome dude! I'm not a cat person (have two German Shepherds) but he's fantastic, and I'm so glad he was a special part of your wedding day!
I am not cool enough to party with that motherfucker.
I have never seen anyone or anything dapper than this.
Goddamn thats a fucking handsome motherfucking kitty
Who's pushing him, Gandalf the Gray ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
Boy looks good in a suit, what can I say?
Then it is decided...the ring must be destroyed...right *meow*.
Frodo Cattins, and Siamese Gamgee.
On his way to appoint his second servant.
Marry him instead.
I dont think he gave a crap about the mission.  He just knew he looked fabulous.
"Hmm. It's about time these humans treat me with the respect I deserve."
Looks like Baron Humbert von Gikkingen, also known simply as The Baron from The Cat returns and Whisper of the heart!
He looks like he's ready to bite someone to me
I love cats and all animals but for me this is really trash.
Want to have him on my own one!
Yea he did 🤗
Don Cherry
Someone needs to photoshop the sphynx gargoyle fridge cat in the stroller.
This is the best thing I’ve seen all week
He's going to be whisker deep in bride's maids and second rate champagne by the end of the night. I hope they served fish.
What a fancy gentleman.
G'day to you too, sir
CATS IT INTO THE FIRE!
cute
This is so freaking cute
The Catfather
Look at this distinguished gentleman
He's gonna steal the bride
So regal
When you realize they probably locked him up because he could run away with rings
Majestic
awwww fur cute
Are we sure this isn’t the groom?
That is the most serious cat I have ever seen. He is absolutely on point.
fantastic
He judging me and all of my life choices
Cat: scritches later, got a job to do
He could be my groom, he’s damn handsome
 So cute but wheres the baby
So regal
What a distinguished gentleman!
Look at this distinguished gentleman. Yes very distinguished indeed.
Meow
Purfection
He's so prepared
Totally Professional !
“ What a distinguish gentleman, yeah“
This is fckng awesome. I would love to see what happened when he got unzipped though!
That cat is dapper as fuck.
What a distinguished gentleman!
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
Mr. Business
Meow version of gangster Gastino .
I’m getting some strong Hannibal Lechter vibes here…
The cat of all cats
Protected from lowly peasantry indeed.
This is awesome!
The cutest ring bearer of all.
what a handsome ring bearer
All I could see was two gentlemen from with waist down , both with canes, standing behind the rear end of a particularly plump lady. Then, I saw the turkey head. My brain still couldn’t register anything else, so the plump lady had a turkey head sticking out of her pants. I did just wake up mid-sleep at 3:30am.

Edit: And I’m now realizing what I thought was a turkey head is actually a cat’s tuxedo.
"The Ring Bearer understood his mission"  -- to knock that accursed ring off the edge of the counter, and send it back to the fires in which it was made!
Majestic AF
I don't think so! That cat thinks it's the best man.
Noble for sure
why is the cat not dressed as frodo?
One ring to rule them all 🐱
He is SO focused
He looks more serious than Tom Cruise in Mission impossible
*I now paw-nounce you husband and wife*
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
the most important person there
I'm wearing a bow tie. Bitches love bow ties.
*"I have to mingle with these peasants, ugh!"*
That's the cutest thing I've seen today 😍
“Get me the fuck outta here…”
Regal. Indeed.
Looking very regal
Needs a top hat
Saw this on twitter & im happy to see it here too 🥰❤
So cool, I love the cat bearing the rings, awesome idea ♥️😻😻😻♥️
Such a proud noble guy.
"this is first and last favor I do for them"
Very  Regal.
He understood the assignment
What a handsome little man
Scary for cat? Unless wedding is in back yard. Even so, scary for cat.
Never have seen a cat that proud.
Wtf is this... he is sitting up straight, calm and collected!  
... my cat literally vandalizes my home daily.
The determination in his eyes is incredible.
Dressed to the nine tails. Such a handsome little gentleman. <3
He knows he is going to have another servant.
I do believe he has the mission well at hand.

 The tux collar and bow, that is just perfect!
Awesome
Signature look of superiority.
I'm sure you and you husband had a good wedding.
That puss looks regal as HELL!
Handsomest boi at the wedding. The groom may take the second place.
This made my day!! 😍😍
The Baron. 💕swoon.
Hannibal lector vibes in that cage
This is giving major smiles around the world. Good work
I don't think I have ever dressed as well as this cat
the cat looks like the best man
He is damn serious about his duty... purrrrrr!
What a distinguished gentleman 🤪
Ring bear*
To throw the ring into the fire of mount doom where it was forged.
The most VIP there!
He's looking sharp! Love this !
oh my god he is so charming.
Such elegance!

Mr. Cat🥰
Cute
What a distinguished gentleman!

Being a handsome dude
 That's a cool cat.
Most handsome ring bearer ever!
Regal AF
look at this distinguished gentleman, yes, look at how he’s sitting 🧐
I bet he didn't bring when the rings when his owners asked him to. 🙄 🤭
Move over the bride and groom here comes the ring bearer the star of the wedding
Kitty is looking  sharp
r/catswithjobs
I looked at this picture with sleepy eyes and thought that guy had crazy long pinkies and this was some sort of deformity post.  Then I blinked away the dream haze and eyeball goo and saw I was woefully mistaken.
Dude is serious AF
“Peasants”
I’ve never seen such a wholesome photo. If he doesn’t take over the world, I don’t know who will.
The Baron!
“Well done, 47. You’ve found a way in. Now locate the target and find an exit.”
damn he has insane amounts of swag
I'm always amazed when I see cats with outfits on. My cat would tear me to shreads trying yo get that on. He drew blood when I tried to put a collar on him. And putting him in a carrier to goto the vet, I gotta suit up like I'm diffusing a bomb
My kitten thinks he’s handsome.
r/CatsWithJobs
He is the main character.
He is locked in good! No chance of escaping his duties
I’m pretty sure he introduced them. Little match-maker.
That cat is wearing too much drip.
Dapper af
Ahh yes such a distinguished gentleman hmm yes
Stoic af
Somebody get this cat a life vest...
That’s not a bear that’s a cat
I thought upstaging the bride at a wedding was a no-no, but how could she possibly compare to this!
Is it just me or does his facial expression gives off that badass James Bond vibes? Haha
He looks like The Baron 😻
Did they put it in a carriage because cats don't give a fuck and probably would have ran away to do something else?
Either that or he is planning his escape plan
He'll have nothing other than Fancy Feast
So handsome 😍
Wow! He was so purfect for the job!!! 😍 And congratulations! Wishes for many, many happy years together.
Omg this is so cute that my cold black heart can’t handle it. What an ABSOLUTE GENTLEMAN🥺😭
Ring bearer? No. Kitty is just waiting for his cue. “If anyone has a reason these two should NOT be wed, let them speak now or forever hold their peace.”

“Meow.”
So proud to be of service
Finally. I am being treated with the respect I so richly deserve. And I look damn good …
this deserves every award. my brain just flooded with happy chemicals
Yes. Seriously committed!
Damn I saw this post on Imgur. Thought of posting it, later I didn't. Who knew this photo could be so viral... XD
how does this cat look so cool in a push chair
You guys are sending a cat to Mordor?
He also doubles as the wedding singer. Been practicing every night at 3am.

The Baron!

“Yes, yes. The peasants “families” must assemble in full that I may make the final decision of wether they shall be fitting serfs, then I may give this “marriage” my consent and permission.” -tuxedo cat
I’m totally doing this with my cat lol
Yes. I finally figured out how to incorporate my cat into my future wedding. Yes
OMG look at this distinguished Gentlecat!!!! WOW ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Such a proper fucking gentlemen
He looks ready too simply walk into mordor
I feel like I've seen this elsewhere. Where's the original source?
seeing the cat dressed up like that kinda reminds me of baron from whisper of the heart and the cat returns
>psychologically and phsyiologically stressing tf out of my cat to make him a cool wedding prop

no thanks
Fucking white people
Should have been a tuxedo cat, then it would be a tuxedo in a tuxedo. Like a turducken
I’m getting third party embarrassment for these people. This picture is super cringy….
If that was true you wouldn't need the screen to keep it from running off.
Lowkey doing this at my wedding now
r/catsdoingjobs
This fills me with such DELIGHT, I can hardly express it!!
He does not look pleased. He’s plotting his escape.
He hated every minute of it but he was such a professional you wouldn‘t even know it!
This is so dumb
Not cool
How anyone gives the responsibility to a cat is beyond my comprehension. Did they hire someone to licke the cats asshole beforehand, just in case it would get such notions duing the isle rolling?
Its a CAT. His place is on the GROUND.
This isn't your photo. What a weirdo.
I only wish good things upon all people, but, I feel confident that the arguments that will precede this future divorce will include the wild shouting of an insane woman.
Dress for the job you want, not the one you have.
omg it's so cute
If you love your pets plz stop pretending they are humans.
It' bringing happiness to only one person : you, not them.
Peace

u/redtaboo u/xenoben cat
Oh boy
Wtf lol this is going to be Izzy
Where did you get that tux?
Baby girl is that you?
Being pushed down the aisle as the ring bearer is such a flex
I get it. I was a ring bearer for many weddings as a child. I even got pneumonia days leading up to my
aunt’s. I walked down the isle and then had to be stowed away in a back room to play video games.
u/KhuxAkuna how did the guests react to this most purrfect entrance?!
I thought of the word ‘pram’ and started laughing a maniac
That is not a Ring Bear!

(Cute cat tho)
Is that Michael Scott pushing him?
r/eldenring reference
I'm going to get a stroller to push my dog around
Ring bear *wink*
This is insane
Read title as "Ring Beast..."
"Come, Mr. Whiskers!  I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you!"
Why would you have a cat do this, isn't it asking for trouble?
He look nervous
Oh
It’s a cat not a bear…
this is me in the future
Shit is gonna hit the roof, soon.
Can somebody paste him into church scene of November Rain instead of Slash?
Can I be the bearer of the ring bearer?
What a perfect outfit.
I'm pretty sure I saw this cat in Whisper of the Heart
maybe this should be in r/youseeingthisshit ?
That’s not a bear. That’s a Calf.
The ring bear?
Its bothering me how those chairs are placed at an incline
Admittedly I'm a bit tired and overwhelmed at the moment, but this legit just made me cry. His little suit!!!
That’s a furry Chuck Bass XOXO
Reddit moment
/r/catswithjobs
I looked at the picture before the sub name, and was convinced it was going to be r/awfuleverything
Saw the title and thought I was in r/tolkienfans for a moment
What ??
omg... im crying :D
“Is it safe? Is it secret?”
I want to marry him. Don't tell.my cat.
Catus Imperious
That’s not a ring bear. That’s not a ring bear at all.
 KaHt
wait it's not a LOTR reference?
I didn’t know crazy cat ladies get married.
To bear the ring of power is to be alone...
r/catswithjobs
My love, i'm coming. But looking at the face of this "cat's root" looks a bit forced 🤣
"look at this distinguish gentleman, look at the way hes sitting ohh yeah yeah"
 here's a variant of Socks u/rework3353 😁
I was expecting Frodo.
I would never do this. But I love people that do. It’s so funny.
Lol
Reporting for duty
what xd
Reminds me of the cat returns
[the cat returns](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_Returns)
Dapper ass Mr. bigglesworth
He probably thinks the ceremony is for him
I totally agree. The Ring Bearer is taking this honor very seriously.   


We humans far far underestimate other animals besides ourselves, and we're not even doing to good a job of that.
He knew the assignment
Omg, this is so cute!
Hello, handsome!
Now if THIS isn’t the definition of regal, I don’t know what is.
The main guest of the party
To be bearer of rings
Awww, look that! /endbabytalk
Aww indeed.  I was expecting Lord of the Rings, got terminal cuteness instead.  Cats are amazing.
Omg and the look on his face is priceless 🤣
“Peasants.”
🤪🙄
Plot twist! He’s taxidermied.
Plot twist: the cat ate the rings and they’re all waiting for the cat to crap em out
😂😂😂😍😍😍
What a noble little dude!
He looks so proud
Sooo handsome!
Omg I love that kitty!
That's Tom 💯
jinxie
i love it!!!
Wow, really proud brides mate!

I love this photo. And I’m not even owned by a cat.

That cat is so dam tight right now. Hes locked up, dressed up, and now hes gotta perform a mission?
Sitting with such pride like a good kitty boy😘😍
HE LOOKS SO PERFECT!!
one of these days i'm gonna see a video on here of an actual ring bear. 

it HAS to happen....
Reminds me of the cat from Whisper of the heart.
what a handsome boy
Giving a cat a ring seems like a really
Bad idea
All about the bride?  I think NOT.
🥰🥰🥰
His mission: to steal the bride away for a purrrfect romantic vacation
Love him ❤️

u/daniellemx
Clearly this is this cat’s day and not any stinky humans big day
Wow! This blew up so much more than we expected! My new wife and I are so overwhelmed with the lovely comments, the awards, and all the well wishes, it's really making the start to our new life together amazing!

Thank you all so much for this! Special thanks to our brother-in-law for walking Moose down the aisle!

Since everyone seems to like Moose so much we have some other pics on lily.and.moose on Instagram that have him, and some with his little sister Lily :)
Shame it wasn’t a ring bear
Well, now I know how to work in my baby girl into my future, hypothetical wedding.
Oh i think he died... Oh no he not die
I always said I have resting bitch face, but apparently I have regal resting feline face
I love hims 😍
My ring bearer was a black lab. Wonderful!
 “Don Catleone, I am honoured and grateful that you have invited me to your home on the wedding day of your Hooman. And may their first child be a masculine child.”
Kitty looking spiffy 💯
So FANCY
Yes he sure did 😂
The most dapper boy!
Nice post!
what a distinguished gentleman
The ring bear
So handsome in his little tie.
Elegant!
What a dapper young man!
That is one dapper cat! If he had a voice I bet he would sound like Morgan Freeman! Awesome.
Dapper boy
Top-notch title!
If I had a Pinterest wedding board, I would add this!
Very solemn but he also clearly has his concernd about the marriage taking place.
Khajit...has...something in his eye...
What a dapper young man!
This is so funny and adorable!! I'd love to have my Stitch in my wedding if I got married.
He looks like he’s been training his whole life for this day
This is amazing
He has the perfect bearing to bear the ring🐈
Awesome!
I need videos this is too cute lol
You can dress me up but you can't take to the vet....in this rolling cat carrier.
*Share the load*
I just hope his name is Mr. Something and not Scruffy or Ralph
Khajit has wares if you have coin.
He doesn't look happy lol
Ummm, no video? Is picture of a cat.
Beats a screaming toddler for sure.
Aww.. So handsome!
What a handsome boy
That’s a ring bear with over 100k upvotes
Gosh! So handsome in that suit! Lucky couple! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)

Anyone every had their cat act as flower girl?!
Lol, that is purrfect!
Aww he's cute he's ready 4 a big job at the wedding
So dapper!!
Hahahaha so cute <3
He’s looking down his nose sideways at all of us.
I don't know why but I want to smack this kitty xD
😅![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
He looks great and it suits him but also kind of sad to have your furbaby as ring bearer
Poor cat…
