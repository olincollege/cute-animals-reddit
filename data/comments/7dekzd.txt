I think I need a cute little Prairie Dog in my life to boss me around and demand pets.
Was waiting for the dramatic turn around. Was not disappointed. 
Your cat is all fucked up.
That Force Persuade.  Good technique.
Alan?
"In many cases, once a male has reached sexual maturity, (neutered or not) his territorial behaviors may prevent him from being exposed to anyone who lives outside of your home. Subsequently, you can not trust him with strangers because he may bite."

That explains why my cute little prairie dog pup grew up into a violant little shit that would mercilessly bite anyone who wasn't me and my dad.
That hand gesture like 'bitch gimme pets'
Please put a top hat on him.
I love how the lil fella gave you visual instruction on how to do your job!

From my favorite IG P-Dog. Nasumiso
They're incredibly smart. They have an advanced language system and can distinguish all kinds of sounds, and can learn what certain commands mean because of that. My Bucky knew all kinds of crazy stuff, easily one of the best pets I ever had. She HATED my ex wife too, (who wasn't my ex at the time) and I feel like that should have been a sign I paid attention to.
Imagine the intelligence it requires to think to associate your hand with its paw, match your petting motion with its own paw motion, turn around and look at you, and communicate visually what it wants (like an Italian). This is awesome. It displays the linking of higher level ideas in its brain (and makes you wonder why we still can‚Äôt match a ‚Äúsimple‚Äù prairie dog with our own neural nets). By the way, have you guys seen Exploding Varmints?

DUN!  DUN!  DUNNNNNNNNN!
What type of dog is this?
The force is strong in this one
This stretched guinea pig likes pets.
My friend had a prairie dog when we were growing up. It was a lot of fun. It would chase you around in a fun way and grab your ankles if he caught you. 
He liked rubbing his front teeth on your fingers. 
He never bit me but I was always worried he would. 
They could also let him out in the yard and he would just run around and come back if you called him. 
Unfortunately he was hit by a car and didn‚Äôt make it. 

You can tell the goodness of a creature by how much it desires pets/rubs. Dogs? Extremely good. Wasps? Very bad. Porcupines? Tragically, they are very good. They want pets more than they can communicate.
Wish I had another prairie dog.  Best pet I ever had.  My cats used to love playing with him.
"..................PET........."
this is what happens when a capybara gets a baby with a hamster
When he did that hand motion I couldn't stop smiling. What a smart little guy.
I think your cat has osteoporosis
those nails look fresh out of Jersey Shore
It pets the back or it gets the teeth!

It‚Äôs so adorable. Now ruin it for me and tell, Why they are terrible pets or something :[
I hope this gets upvoted to the moon just for that simple little hand motion.
Where are this rabbit's ears
"You have one job human"
"Did I say you were done?"
PULL THE CAR OVER DAD!
I'M PRAIRIE DOGIN' BACK HERE!
It never ceases to amaze me when scientists say we anthropomorphize animals, but that is clear communication right there.
my cat use to eat those all the time when i lived on Padre Island, Tx. Then my cat was ate by coyotes. 
That petting motion it did :O ^^OHMIGOD!
Alan! Alan!
yes. this is amazing!!!
Why can't I just get the video URL?! 

This is infuriating. I dont want to always send someone to the comments. 
my name prare king

my subject smart

did him a train

when pets to start

obey me hooman

dis is my law

gib me the pets

i rayse the paw
Anyone have a mirror? Reddit video is hot garbage.
Fattest meerkat ever.
My daughter‚Äôs friend had one, although very cute it did bite and they don‚Äôt live very long.
I booped a prairie dog on the head at Devil‚Äôs Tower once. I know I wasn‚Äôt supposed to, but I was young and stupid and I booped it anyway. Its fur was greasy and matted, unlike the one in this video whose fur seems soft and plush. My wild prairie dog did not ask for more pets; rather it just gave me a quizzical look, as if to say SNACKS OR NO SNACKS?
Well.....we shot millions of those damn little pests on the farm. 
Holy tits, this is the cutest thing that I think I'm going to see today. 
"*Resume*" 
Huh it's right handed
Around here they're vermin and it's encouraged that you exterminate them. They burrow all over the place and cause damage to foundations.

Oh, and plague. They carry plague.
That was so sassy.
"Why you stop?" Gestures with paw "continue human"
This is incredible 
Humans are pretty dumb and often need ongoing instructions to execute pets
I got idea for a new game, "Keep petting and nobody explodes".
I think that was a Jedi mind trick.
With the claws on that thing, I'd do what he said too...
I feel bad for killing so many as a boy.
They taste soo bad 
I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs happy or angry üòÇ
Wow! The level of intelligence in something so small, you wouldn't consider it more than roadkill at most times....

Really makes you rethink our position in the world and what life would be like if every animal didn't have to struggle for existence.
Those are considered pests here...but very cute! 
Mini nazi salute XD
As if the world needed another masturbation euphemism, now we have petting the gopher.
EA sucks
In the future every home will have a giant hand to pet humans.
I wonder, why do animals like getting pet?
Let me tell you what I want you to do....
Watching this makes me want a capybara even more.
I feel like his name is Kim Jong Un but i dont know why?
Is that a whistle pig/groundhog/woodchuck?
Oh I needed this today. Thank you for sharing.
This little animal needs more than 1 of them to be happy! You need to get him a friend.
Hay. Do dis.
Was anyone else thinking of the dramatic look hamster thing at first? I was confused the first second or two then realized I'm an idiot
It‚Äôs cute as fuck but those claws say don‚Äôt ever disappoint me
We have 2 at home. Brother in law calls them ground squirrels, lol. One of the stranger pets I've had other than Anoles. Now those were fun, is wear them as earrings, lol.
Nice marmot! 
so many of these new-breed exotic pets seem to be missing a very important statement as part of their sales pitch -- this cute little _____ is awesome to interact with...*for a time*. full ownership constitutes full time supervision or be prepared to have them revert back to a wild animal.

you can never really just let them just do their thing because 'their thing' is finding a mate and protecting offspring and preparing for a harsh winter. you always have to be on them reinforcing boundaries and relationships, which is fine if you are interested in being an animal handler 24/7, otherwise, to be completely honest with myself, that sounds exhausting and these cute moments wouldn't be enough to sustain my interest.

i need to be able to trust i can leave them alone and they won't destroy stuff (or attack me) because winters a'comin.

My grandma's dachshund does this. When I stop petting her she'll roll over look at me and start moving her right paw in a petting motion.
U/wildlife07
This made me so happy 
Pack it in, and shut down the subreddit, mods. /r/aww has found a winner.
That‚Äôs a great title.

My dog does the same thing. 
How cute.

FTFY
IÔ∏è love how almost all animals seem to enjoy being pet by humans. These dexterous hands are GOLDEN in the animal world
prarie dogs always look so awkward
I cannot handle this
Petting intensifies.
That is the most adorable thing I have ever seen!
that is pretty ridiculously cute
Everything likes a little love. 
I love this so much. I want a squirrel.
So cute
I had no idea they were that friendly 
Pet not slap.

A prairie dog was my very first pet when I was three years old. My dad was at a shelter and there was a girl there trying to get rid of it. The shelter wouldn‚Äôt take it so my dad just offered to take her because he felt bad. Her name was Molly and I used to feed her eggo waffles and graham crackers...I was not the smartest back then
"Allan! Allan! Allan!! .....Alllaaaaan!!"
I fucking love this!
Does it have large talons?
Al, Al, Al, Al, Al, Al, Al, Al, Al, Al,

ITT how the fuck have so many people had pet prairie dogs???
I like how it demonstrates impatiently for the person the second time around. "No, you pets liek dis."

that is pretty ridiculously cute
Lol, it‚Äôs funny how animals always has that slight delay when you stop petting them and they demand you to continue. 
Who is the pet here.
If we substitute the Prairie dog for a penis, you know how shit goes down every 4 hours.
Alan! Alan! Alan!Alan! Al! Alan!
I love the he keeps eye contact like ‚ÄúYou better not stop again, bitch.‚Äù
You can get the bubonic plague from fleas carried by prairie dogs. I used to live in west Texas and our local hospital got several cases every year.
This is the pet you are looking for. *swipe*
They do the same Prairie Dog I believe it comes from the images anymore..?
My dad used to work for a treat and loved being pet and falling asleep in my head radio
Prairie Dog I believe it comes from the neighbors a few times.
I think this is my favourite thing on this sub
I just wanted to comment on one of my favorite posts before this thing gets archived. That‚Äôs all.
Damn thats a good looking pikachu. Where to find one?

Is that a fat prairie dog or a ground hog?
This is my dog. He even sits like that. He's weird. 
That's hilarious but those are some serious claws
my bunny demands pets, but this is cuter!

Now do it again.
I would love to have this little guy as a pet. I actually think it and my cat would eat along great since she constantly demands pets and likes to stand up like a prairie dog 
What does their fur feel like?
That's awesome lmao
I want one of these, a fox and a magpie. Those are my dream non-traditional pets.
omg that prairie dog is adorable! 
Nice rabbit you got there
THAT LITTLE HAND GESTURE
LOL the hand motion!~ SLEEP

I half expected him to dramatically turn around
I've always wanted a pretty that could give me the plague! Bring it yer dead!
What animal is that?
Lol... that bit where he's looking away at the start. Thought for sure it was the origin of the Dramatic Chipmunk video at first.
I heart whistlepig

what a weird squirrel
Man, this gif makes me sad. I perfused and dissected the brains out of a bunch of these guys last year :(
Wow what kind of dog is this 
plague pupper
This clip took me way too deep into philosophy.
This is a demonstration of how humans domesticated animals

Its all about the scratches
that face...it shows no warmth or gratitude, only expectation and a bit of contempt.
When I lived in Colorado we were told via PSA never to touch the prarie dogs because they are highly diseased animals
This is the cutest thing EVER! 
IÔ∏è find it so intriguing how he communicated that.  
"ALAN!"
"You *will* pet."

*"..I will."*
We see here who the real master is.
Seems about right. Mine are equally demanding. 
I really don't know why, but when he turns around he reminds me of an older Dustin Hoffman.
Anyone else just hear ‚Äú Allan, Allan, Allan, Allan‚Äù 
He's adorable!!
Cute
is that a prairie dog or a gopher and what state is it legal in there cute or hes cute
Is this the pet of a Japanese person?  Somehow they always have the best pets.
I have this constant fear these things will suddenly attack the camera or something.
I don't get these off-brand pets...
I was waiting for an extremely dramatic turn of the head
Can someone tell me why posts like this when opening on Android, try to save as "dashplaylist.mpd" and can't be viewed?  Would be much appreciated, thanks in advance for any help.
Have fun getting the plague.
He said that?
That human has a weird way of petting. Seems robotic.

I used to have a pet prairie dog as a kid. His name was Petey (*get it? P.D.*)
"How do I say......"
Why am I seeing this post every 6 posts on Reddit mobile official app?
someone need to remake this with text and post it on r/animaltextgifs
They always hate it when we pet them until we stop petting them.
I started cracking up in public eating a burrito.  
What kind of rodent is that thing?
I was waiting for it to dramatically turn around
That‚Äôs a good, stiff prairie dog 
That's so funny lol
Where did you get those Eiffel Tower curtains? They‚Äôre adorable. 
Does anyone know how I'd go about saving this? I can't seem to figure it out on my own.
Aww
Demanding little moocher isn‚Äôt he?
I like his squinty eyes.
Someone please explain to me how this is not good for the prairie dog. Like when whatever owl expert popped up to say that all these gifs of people petting or otherwise treating owls the way you would a typical domesticated animal is a sign that the owl is extremely stressed and completely broken down. Otherwise, I'm getting a prairie dog.
That creature fucking owns you... and it isn't even a cat!
And this was the story of how one gopher with a look dramatic enough to destroy entire civilizations was humanized.

This was how dramatic look gopher ended.  Not with a bang, but with a pet.
My dad used to work for a company that made helicopter and airplane parts, and the owner loved these little guys so much that he commissioned an enclosure in the parking lot that had them in it. It had a little platform you could walk up to and watch them from above...then there was a bad storm and their tunnels collapsed killing them...It was a sad day. 
DUN DUN DUN!
He ate my Timothy. 
What kind of dog is this ?
Who says animals can't communicate
He squinted at you
Small hands or huge mouse?
Are you in a hospital?
I love how it turns around and is all like, "Bruh. Move your hand."
My reaction was meh until he did the arm motion. Too cute.
"Bitch, you done when I say you done!"

Very cute, never seen such a tame prairie dog before, didn't know they could be kept as pets.

That is a fat and happy PD!
I wonder if he thinks he has psychic powers?
Looks like Dustin Hoffman
Love it 
My brother's corgi does the same thing.
Where the hell do people get these animals 
"hey, fucking pet'
 Did not know parts of the world kept prairie dogs as pets.
It's interesting: These creatures are known to have some sort of language but I wonder if pantomime is part of it in nature?

I am not sure a dog or cat would do this -- this is more sophisticated than what a dog or cat (at least the ones I know would do) which is just rub against you or look at you meaningfully.
It makes you wonder how many animals out there that would love to be pet. (Without you losing a limb)
*dramatic Prairie dog entrance
THIS is a prairie dog?
" If you don't pet!" 
"You see these nails darling!" 
"It will be in your FACE!"

Petpetpet. What a beautiful little bean. 
Can you own praire dogs? I thought they carried the plague, at least around here they do.

Like a jedi mind trick
We need a sub entirely dedicated to animals demanding pets from humans.

I'll wait...
This is actually the way a prairie dog signals that a predator is nearby and obviously this prairie dog is bravely sacrificing itself for the greater good of its tribe.
Good, this is good. 
For some reason this was super creepy.
Hahaha! You do what I want, human.
That rodent's hand gesture looks very robotic. 
cutest thing ever
Jedi mind trick from a prarie dog.
Lmao jdkkdjjsijyd im dead
I wonder if he thinks he's doing some psychosomatic suggestion to make humans think they want to pet him
You think the prairie dog is your pet, but the reverse might be closer to the truth.
Hahaha, that animal is cute 
I know what's I's wants and when I's wants it.
Such a well-trained human.
ALAN!
Beware of Prairie Dog. He takes pets.
I verbally aww'd üòç
Adorable. Fun to shoot, but adorable 
Beware the R.O.U.S.s!
The prairie dog has trained his human very well! :p
Amazing 
Hmm... do any other animals besides us humans give pets as good?

Are humans the master of all animals because we are good at pets?
Help those pets in poor condition
Question for animalologists: Is the "pet me" hand movement a coincidence, or do prairie dogs have the capacity to mimicking human behavior?
That human is well trained 
Nice marmot.
I hope you checked where that prarie dog came from. There are some inhumane ways to capture these guys, and sell them. One of which is vacuuming them out of their burrows. Which is a bit fucked if you ask me.
I was hoping it was going to turn around like the Dramatic Chipmunk 
I think I‚Äôve found my gfs spirit animal...
Ah, that wasn't a request, that was a command.
Hahaha, my Malamute does this exact same thing.
HOW do i download this?

Yes, pet out the fleas human. Yeeeesssssssssss
Does anyone else feel like there has been a recent influx of exotic pets on Reddit?
Why do rodents act more ‚Äúreptilian‚Äù than like say dogs or pigs?
Sooo....nobody else noticing you can't get the links from the images anymore..? What a crock of shit.. fuck you reddit. 
My 3rd grade class had a pet prairie dog named peanut... This brought back so much nostalgia, he loved to be petted and sometimes we would let him cruise around the classroom.
/r/whatswrongwithyourdog
That's so cute it's almost borderline creepy. The way he moved his paw up and down to ask for more pets. Or am I the only one feeling this way?
I see a lot of those gifs lately.... are we the pets?
I wanna see what he does if you don't start petting him right away
Lmfao! That‚Äôs priceless

So cute tho üòç
is it the same Prairie Dog as in this thread?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/comments/7av9s3/please_sir_may_i_have_another/
I absolutely loved taking my dog (RIP) for walks through the nearby P dog towns and watching them yip and do P dog stuff. Never occurred to me they could be kept as a pet! How does that work out for you OP? How did you come to have one that trusted you and would live in your home? What do you feed him/her? What about poo? Honest questions I would love to know the answer to. :)
wait, now go.
AHHAHAHA!
*In the voice of James Earl Jones*

**Why have stopped!? like this human, good, very good**
C A D D Y S H A C K
Those claws kind of scare me tbh
My dogs are a lot less subtle. They sit and stare at you as you pet them, and when you stop they immediately start pawing/clawing at you until you resume.

They do the same thing to each other when playing. One will get tired and take a break and the other just pats them on the head until they get up. They're all business - no time for waiting around.
Hahaha!
He was like "c'mon the fuck you stop for?!"

My dog also does this except he will instead sit there and claw you till he either gets bored, you leave, you‚Äôre bleeding, or you pet him. 
This is awesome
That is incredible
Makes me wonder which one is the real pet.
I love how he turns around and you can see the disappointment in his eyes, how he commands the pets. Que adorable.
What kind of dog is this 
Awww
I used to have two prairie dogs when I was younger. I know they are illegal in a few us states. Not sure which. But they do make great pets. If left unwatched they WILL destroy every electrical cord in the house. Also one of them did bite a chunk of my friends(10) wrist off when she accidentally startled it in the cage. Other than that!! All love.

Your cat is very cute, but kinda strange looking.
Omg stop it I can't it's too cute 
I love how he makes the petting gesture with his hand.
I always imagine it must be quite a trip for an animal not accustomed to being petted by humans to be petted for the first time. (Is petted the right word? It feels wrong).
True, but they are everywhere!! I like them, but here it‚Äôs legal to kill them. 
Oh, he‚Äôs right handed.
Prairie dogs are cute, but they will literally die if they are lonely or not getting enough attention.

Moved a few months ago but at the other house a giant ground hog lived somewhere near a drain pipe from the neighbors a few houses down, for whatever reason his tunnels either ran 2-300 ft or he knew my cat had a bowl of food outside so he decided to move.  

I went out the backdoor one day and he was sleeping on the backsteps, I thought he's my pet now....saw him a few days later near the steps, said screw it I set out a handful of cat food. Did this a few times. 

Then one day guess he was hungry he was standing up against the door waiting for food dogs saw him and decided fuck him, dog broke the glass window out...never saw him again :(
My heart exploded 
oh nice marmot
I was waiting for the DUN DUN DUUUN look but was met with a cute hand gesture instead ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Is there an easy way of sharing these weird, embedded reddit video/gif things, on either mobile or desktop? It's obviously super easy to send a direct link to a gif on Imgur or gifv, and I'm curious if there's any equivalent way of doing that with something like this
I watched it again and it was even better the second time
That reaction is fucking priceless!
Please insert cute prairie dog videos below this comment.

Thank you and have a nice day.
I don't know if its just the computer playing tricks but the hand gesture looks slightly C.G to me for some reason. 

Anyone else see the weird motion capture of the hand when it raised up?

Also, obviously, I want one!
Prairie dogs are amazing. They need more constant social affection than owning a monkey though so we never got one.

My old college town has a prairie dog colony. I now plan on kidnapping one, enslaving it until it develops Stockholm Syndrome, and wants cuddles constantly. 
It even used the correct paw to indicate which arm was petting it.
absolutely really cute. which type of animal is this?
Any time I see these things they seem to have so much character.
What's that animal? Pls someone tell me
Cute. Like we are their big bros. We evolved so much faster but we can still love eachother.

Who has a pet prairie dog? Need more info...
Love this!
The arm signal to continue.

I worked at a pet store once that illegally sold prairie dogs. One escaped into the warehouse and hid under a pallet. I pulled him out but he bit the FUCK out of my hand. Little dude had blood all over him. My blood. Cute little jerk.
That looks like sign language to me, when he raises his paw...?
"We're called pets for a reason."
you seriously can get a pet Prairie dog? :D 
And they say animals dont have soul. Freakin catholics
I love this so much hahah
Holy shit. That just made my whole day. I wasn't expecting that!
I need this little guy in my life. <3
And....now you have the plague.  
What is more amazing is the degree of control this animal has over its human.

Incredibly clear communication.  Simple command and obedience.

Don't fucking keep prairie dogs as pets, god damnit. People who do so are *assholes.*
wow.... demanding 
Caution! For everyone who wants one they are illegal in many places because they are a major resevior for plauge. Like THE plague. Yersenia pestis.
Funny! That's a new one on me. I never knew prairie dogs could be pets.

Haha cute little sucker 
I love how trained that prairie dogs human is
It's interesting: These creatures are known to have so many people had pet prairie dogs???
They're considered invasive rodents locally and the owner loved these little guys so much character.
Haha it demands to be petted

I've always wanted a Prairie dog since I saw them at the zoo when I was a kid... Maybe I should buy one.

Why don't animals ever pet humans? They learn so much from us, but they can't even return a belly rub or head scratch.

That person is so bad at pettin it hurts to watch.

Do you want plague?  Because that's how you get plague.

TDIL I want a prairie dog. 
That's one ugly rat
I like to stroke my gopher too. Actually Ive begun 90 days nofap. Strokin my gopher no more
I'm pretty sure these things are made for target practice
No lie, if that robotic land rodent diabolically turned 'round to face me like that... and then demanded more pets ... id shoot it. I'd shoot it right in the f*ckn face. 

Cute tho. 
The broken English we attribute to animals is so bizarre. It is like we are mentally imposing the image of a toddler on them so we can delude ourselves into feeling the satisfaction of raising an actual human child (when in fact these creatures are fundamentally different in kind and have zero potential to acheive even the beginnings of personhood).
