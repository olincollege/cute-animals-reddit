That dog has a better life than most people in the world.
Dogs enjoying farm life videos are awesome
My mom got one when I was in high school and he got to be 180 lbs!I suffered insomnia really bad and would take a lot of night time walks and I always felt safe with him accompanying me.Had a growl that could rattle a tree and the biggest dang teeth I‚Äôve ever seen,but was such a sweet boy with our kittens.The only thing you have to be careful about is hip dysplasia as it‚Äôs really common in big breeds like this.Also they love to lean on people and many a guest was knocked over by accident while acquiring pets.

Thank you for cutting it off before the Doggo gets older and slower and I start weeping
Beautiful baby
Kangals are goddamn enormous, lol.
What breed of dog is this? Looks and acts exactly my rescue. We had always assumed he was a German Shepard mix.
They grow up fast in size only.

My Rough Collie was still the same playful mentality as a 2mth old puppy when I got him until the day he passed aged 10.
Even when he was stricken with liver failure and all sorts of health issues, he was playful until the day he suddenly couldn't move at all and just lay there. but kept raising his head up (only part of his body he can move), doing his usual playful head bob that I have seen since the day I knew him, signalling he wants to play.

Then when I lay his cheery face on my lap as I pet him, he suddenly passed on and lay silent. 

You little beautiful bastard you knew it was time to go and you trapped me to come down lay beside you and play with you one last time with that little usual head bob. 

(Incidentally, this happened to most of my pets. My budgie and my chinchilla also died in my hands/arms/lap, I want to cry...)

RIP my beautiful best friend.

(So sorry to suddenly turn something wholesome to something so sad. Because this fella reminded me the most of my old friend)
We're all lucky this didn't end like I hoped it wouldn't
Aww him and his baby moo friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
He'll always be a pup, just an old one ^_^ he's got the spirit of a pup
I want 30 mins of this pls. Especially with how 2020 is going
This is the farm omnis think their great value Walmart meat comes from
Ugh the music. I irrationally hate this and i cannot articulate why.
Super sad that all his friends are dead
Well there goes my tears
Oh my heart! What a wonderful life for this pup!
What the hell is that song, why does the singer shift to some stupid voice like he caught his balls in a door. Like, that really sounds like me when i put on a stupid high pitched voice and he's actually singing with it.
Does anyone find it pretty crazy how there's a calf in here and a puppy who both display similar traits and yet one will live a full pampered life and one will be slaughtered and become food lmao
If only we could treat all the animals in this video the way that dog is treated...
Yall know what will happen to these cows right?
I have to give you so many kudos for giving your working dog excellent socialization and training. I‚Äôve acquired several livestock guardians at about 9-11 months old - when they‚Äôre no longer cute puppies and when training them starts to get hard. People think they can just throw LGD puppies out in a field and let their instincts take over and I hate that so much!! I‚Äôve put a solid 7 months of work into a female that I got when she was nine months and gosh I swore a lot during those months. But after consistent training and being spayed, she has turned a corner and is a Very Good Girl. I can leave her with the chickens unsupervised now. So to see your dog get such great training makes my heart so happy.
You‚Äôre so lucky you didn‚Äôt show him dying. I mean, I‚Äôm so lucky you didn‚Äôt show him dying!
it‚Äôs a shame basically all of the cows, chickens and sheep will be slaughtered for food. :(
Jesus watch without sound üòñ
[removed]
What is that song???
aww such a pretty kangal boy, they are the unique breed of my hometown in anatolia, sivas. shepherds prefer them because they are so big and strong they can easily defend the flock against wolf attacks, and even though they seem so enormous and scary, they are all such goofballs. when i was a kid it was very usual to see stray kangals walking around the city. i do miss them.
Super weird vibes from this video.
What a great life for that pupper.  All dogs should be so lucky.
Now I'm sad cuz at the beginning he had this little friend, this black tiny calf, and where is he now? Are they still friends?
In case anyone was wondering about the song,

it's a cover of Home (originally by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros) by Tom Rosenthal, published under the "pseudonym" Edith Whiskers (also on Spotify). :)

He's the most wonderful musician and just the wholesomest human being btw.
God this cover is fuckin bad
The type of video that makes you drop everything to become a farmer, then realize you don't know shit about farming and it's a crazy amount of work.
was so afraid it was a memorial video
I love it!
Movie of the Year.
I'll always tear up to this ancient dog eulogy:

"I am in tears, while carrying you to your last resting place as much as I rejoiced when bringing you home with my own hands 15 years ago."
Lol I thought at the beginning the dog turned into that massive cow
Anatolian Shepard?
Damned, why am I crying?!!
I'm jealous of this dog's life!
Chunky puppy phase is an amazing phase
My dog is a Great Pyrenees lab mix that we got from a litter born on a farm and he looks exactly like this- he‚Äôs my baby!! He‚Äôs so cute!! He looks big and mean and he‚Äôll bark at strangers but all he does is cuddle haha

Oh what I would do to be a farm dog
This was so awesome thank you for sharing.
It must be so nice as a dog to live on a farm. So much space to play on. He/she looks so happy.
I want to be reincarnated as a farm dog.
The higher vocal in the background music sounds like the Pervy old neighbor from family guy
Cute dog, but if I never hear this self-indulgent, hokey song ever again, it‚Äôll be too soon.
Hi, reddit police? Yes, this OP right here needs to be arrested for posting a video that ended too soon.
Love the video, so damn adorable, but that signing is so bad. Reminds me of that tiptoe through the tulips
Never thought I'd hear Tom Rosenthal in a video like this!!! He's got a lovely voice.
You just made my whole thank you really thank you

That dog has the perfect life.
Ouch might be the worst song I ever heard.  That guys off tune voice.
Calves are taken from their mothers after a couple days and are given supplemental milk. As cute as this is, the mother is wailing for that calf right now. Not your mom, not your milk.
Thank you for this ..what a wonderful life on a farm for your beautiful  dog
I would die for him.
He's living his best life. Not going to lie feeling very jelly...
The song is a cover of Home by Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, don't know who's doing the cover though.
This made my day, thank you so much!
This is almost a commercial for people to start getting into farming. 

 "Do you love Dogs?  Is your Dog considered as part of your family?  If you answer yes to either of these questions, try farming.  Farming is proven to increase joy, socialization and general well being for Dogs.

Ask your family today about becoming farmers"

This message has been brought to you by the Pups and Paws association of America.
The irony in this vid is a bit sickening.
Too wholesome
best part of their life is on the farm or in the forest!
Beautiful
Phew. If I had to watch this dog get old and die, I was going to get back in bed.
I wanted this to be longer..more plz.

Good puppo!
Turkish Kangal? A friend had one called Bear. He was adorable.

Damn I never got to see my dog when she was a puppy, got her when she still acted like one but was already stretched out

From wiki:

‚ÄúA working Kangal Shepherd Dog on duty will station itself on a high vantage point overlooking its flock. On hot days, the dog will dig itself a hollow in the ground to keep cool. Novices learn by staying close to older dogs. The dogs will work in pairs or teams depending on the size of the flock, taking up positions around the sheep and changing their positions as needed. The intensity of their patrols around the sheep increases at nightfall.‚Äù

Goddamn that is cool! Dogs are awesome. I‚Äôm constantly amazed of their intelligence.
Loved this, thank you for sharing!
Awww
Farm dogs are the best dogs in the world
My parents just got two of these and they are still puppies but they are SO big and they are such love bugs.
So relieved this didn't have a sad ending. I am first dog owner, and I tear up at the posts that have bad news. I love my dog so damn much I'm getting misty eyed just typing this.
Omg that looks like my childhood dog. They could have been sibs. My heart is melty. Such a good doggy.
I have one of those right now. Sweetest dog ever. Love my Lola
Why did this make me happy and sad at the same time.
What an amazing life!!!
Adorable derp
Loved this!!
Thank you.
COWS
This dog as a better life than me
Phew! I thought this was going to end with the dog growing old and dying.
Anyone know the breed? Haven‚Äôt really seen a definitive answer yet
The best boy
What breed of dog is this?
In the time the dog grew up, the cows were killed and replaced 3 times over.
that dog is like what is that
I was worried this video would end sadly once I turned the volume on. 

They're adorable! What breed is this?
Well, thats a good Life!
made me cry a little
Does anyone know the version of this song?
I need a dog
Song pls? c:
Dont blink
With that song I was expecting this story to end at the vet...
So if a dog grows up near animals that could be his prey, it will not see them as prey anymore?
They sure do. Cherish it. Even when he does something irritating. I‚Äôd give my both nuts to have my buddy back peeing in the house.
/u/savethisvideo
NGIL, if this wasn't in AWW, with that title and content I'd be half fearing the clip would end in a "In memorial" caption, and then I'd cry, and then I'd hate you.
That‚Äôs a good dog right there.
Anybody know the song name?
Dog is having his best life.
Lucky dawg!üòç
If anyone knows the version of 'home' that's playing in this video and could link me to it or something, I would really appreciate it!
Whats the name of this song? I want to think of this dog when I listen to it
Why does this dog actually made the world a better place than most people combined
Cherish every moment. They‚Äôre not here for long.

Is that a leonberger?
This Kangal cutie.
That‚Äôs a cozy looking dog

That video was too short.
This is a beautiful collection
Lovely! What kind of breed is it? Looks a bit like a Kangal.
oh man I dropped to tears great video
Gotta say it‚Äôs fulfilling to see dogs living to their fullest potential!
Thanks for posting this. My doggie turns 5 years this month (a Frenchie) and I try to make videos frequently or just take pics randomly when he is being silly or eating some fruit (yeah, he loves a lot of different fruits). He even has his own folder in my iPhone and watching this makes me feel like the past 5 years flew by faster than 5 weeks.
Too fast. Dammit why can't they live as long as us.
:‚Äô)
Doggies when they dream*
Keep going!
Gonna be real with you, the piano had me thinking this was gonna end like six feet under ended.
Black mouth cur‚Äôs are the best dogs
I didn't want it to end!!!
I totally thought that it was gonna show the dog's whole life all the way to it's passing
At every point in the video I was like ‚ÄúI swear if the dog dies at the end‚Äù
Oh where have the years gone?
Can someone link me to this exact version of this song please
I miss my dog...
Good on you and your friend, cherish them
I love that he has puppy energy as an adult. He‚Äôs living a good life
awe what an amazing doge
I thought for sure it was going to end with the dogs grave or something and that would have ended my redditing for today.
What a life to live! That dog looks so happy! It almost looks like a movie how happy he is!
That dog has a great life and a lot of friends. Well done.
This needs to be longer.

This is where I‚Äôll choose to think my dog went when my parents said he went to go live on a farm.
My dog passed away last night and we just buried him about 2 hours ago. Been feeling like shit all day but this just put a smile on my face. Thanks stranger.

So cute!
Great job socialising him! Beautiful working dog

That dog looks like its living the best possible life it can be
Best short film I‚Äôve seen this year.
It‚Äôs not fair, dogs should live as long as humans would ;-;
Dogs really are the best.
That is a bloody good dog
Thank you for improving my day with your video of this heckin good boy!
Beautiful pup! What kind of dog is he/she??
I absolutely need to know this big boys name
Dog has had the best life possible. Thank you OP.
Dogs are so awesome
I fucking love dogs. So much.
Side note, that cover is horrendous.
Please please please, if you‚Äôre gonna have your dog leashed in the bed of a vehicle use a harness and not a collar. If you crash you‚Äôre gonna snap that doggos neck. They literally make harnesses specifically to protect them from a car accident.

God damn, you can‚Äôt even see a video of a dog having fun without people arguing somewhere in the comments
That dog has better life than me ü§£
Im not a dog but i also want to live in a farm
Was hoping to see the slaughter footage but damn. Farmers should eat their dogs when they pass away.
I live in the city now but this makes me miss farm life. What a good pup!
That‚Äôs a happy K-9 unit.
He looks like a Buck! Feel like I'm watching the opening of Call of the Wild!
That's such a wholesome video and the music was perfect for it.  I've never had a friend like that.
I have sounds off and I can just hear the kevin macleod music over this
Such a criminal
