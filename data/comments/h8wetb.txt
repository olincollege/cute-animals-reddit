Both have very nice eyebrows, glad you two could find happiness
Beautiful new couple! Happy for you both!
Okay, someone's gotta ask about the elephant in the room...




Did you get matching glasses on purpose?
Looks like he wheelie likes you.
This is nicest thing I’ve seen on internet in a long time. Good luck
I love how each of you has the same pose in each photo and the girl combines the two in the last one
Just curious, how did you meet during lockdown?
You rolled right into happiness
Oh my word, you are adorable together 😱 and you're confirming the French stereotype of being super fashionable! I hope it is the beginning of something wonderful!
Awe that’s super cute. Xx
Lucky bastard got a gorgeous girl and means of transportation all at once
As a paraplegic I will say congrats! Dating apps can be a little brutal for someone who uses a wheelchair. Though I have found chatting over the internet first helps alleviate a lot of the potential awkwardness the other person might feel in-person and allows them to get comfortable.
Okay, who gave you two the right to both be this gorgeous?

And matching your outfits in the cutest way possible? How dare you?

But seriously this is so lovely and heart warming!
Even with masks on, you can still see the happiness
Vinyl of Nujabes- Metephorical Music ... this man has good taste.
Un couple très mignon! Je vous souhaite la meilleure chance!
Ahhh i remember this! Which outfits did you guys go for on the first date? Think i chose black n white with hightops
I have to admit, I’m distracted by the Nujabes vinyl album... I thought all his work was on CD or digital.
Cute photo set btw.
I love the fact he is sitting down in the photos; that’s someone who notices the small things make the biggest differences sometimes.
Noice.
This is so sweet. Glad to see some sunshine in this world for a change. Hope the best for you both!
Question (and this is just me): Why no arm rests for the wheelchair? That would be kinda uncomfortable (again, this is just me). I thought that type was mainly for rapid movement, like exercising.

Don't hit! I'm completely ignorant of this!
Really cool apartment too!
Bien pour vous deux ! C'est un bel exemple de patience là !

Good for you two ! That's a prime example of patience right there !
Absolutely loving the outfits! So nice to see someone in a wheelchair be fashionable, sometimes I have to use one and I feel like the least fashionable person ever when I'm using it. <3
you guys look adorable I had to make a quick sketch :) https://imgur.com/a/aDoOO5a
Is it awkward in the first meet? Like you form their  voice and speech tone in your head, through reading their text. And its usually sorta different than what you expected.
i love that wall paint job. whered you get the idea from?
My German shepherd and I were scrolling through and seen your post. Congrats 👏 and glad to see positive in this world with all this chaos. Today is my wife's and I 11th anniversary so here's to new beginnings and happy futures. Oh and max says "Woof!"
I dunno if this has already being said but i love how even your glasses match! 
Wish you two the best future together!
r/streetwear would love you guys
how do you two know each other in the first place?
This dude's tattoo looks absolutely sick, would love a better look at that. 

You guys are awesome together!
The only way to have the 100% match would be to wear a pair of Heely's so you both had a wicked set of wheels.
r/mademesmile
Man I'm an idiot. Am was sitting here thinking for a couple minutes wondering who was taking pictures of you guys while you were face timing/taking selfies only to realize you were taking pictures in front of mirrors...
Wow. You know you have found something special when people are getting distant from one another and your are getting close.
I like nice things on the Internet. :)
This is so wholesome
This was the most wholesome thing I've seen so far today on Reddit. I think I'm just gonna leave now and end it on a high note.

You two look great together and I'm super happy for you both!
Can you ask your new guy where he gets his outfits from?!?
We need more like this. Internet was getting so depressing lately
Aw yay!! AOC v.2 :D happy for you both!
I love her style! That striped dress is everything
I wish i could upvote this twice
As a 35yo man I am jealous of how these younglings always look so fresh and clean. 

Y’all cute btw
This is the kinda girl you get to push around.
How awesome! Yay! 😊
What model vinyl turntable does he have?
A dude that is willing to talk to you through a pandemic lockdown, is a dude that will treat you right

Congrats you two!
Α+ love story.
OH MY GOODNESS!!! I saw a post a while ago about the girl in the wheelchair finding an outfit for a date with someone! I’m really happy to see what happened after that!!
You doing the peace sign in the end instead of him makes my heart mellllllt!!!! Happy relationshipping!
You two have STYLE; and matching glasses to boot! Congrats!
ayeee, MR. OIZO!
I reckon it was meant to be with the matching glasses!
Looks like you guys are head over wheels for each other!
I always buy relatively sensible shoes in dark colours, because I want them to last and not show the dirt too much /get grubby. 

I just realised an unexpected benefit of using a chair. Fabulous shoes forever!
Super happy for you!
You guys look so cute together!  I'm glad that y'all met each other💙  
Also, I hope you don't mind, but just wanted to ask if you'd be able to direct me towards the '300 question' document? 🙈 (Courtesy: [Bored Panda](https://www.boredpanda.com/couple-gets-together-after-months-matching-outfits-for-future-first-dates/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=organic))  
My city's still in lockdown and I'm excited to go through the questions with someone I've matched matched with last week!
Y'all are just lovely! Genuinely wish you both happiness.
Can you do us all a favour and both stop being so gorgeous!? Congratulations to you both. I hope this isn’t problematic to say but I really love that hes also sitting in all his pictures. Mimicking the woman he likes like that is so tellingly beautiful xx
Une relation qui va marcher comme sur des roulettes !
Posting yourself in a sub like r/Aww is like giving yourself a nickname.
Vous êtes beaux les gars.
This gives me hope that one day I can find a type of love like this
I hate it when people are in Aww, but y'all are actually one fucking cute couple.
Dang attractive people getting together and finding happiness. Congrats and stuff.
Dude every fucking thing just keep reminding me of how lonely i truly am. Still congrats tho
He’s in for a wheely good time
I also recently met my long distance boyfriend 🥺☺️
Vous dégagez du bonheur! 

"félicitations a vous deux" 


~~et merci covid lol~~
Vous êtes trop beaux ! Plein de bonheur pour vous !
Vous êtes stylés ! Beaucoup de bonheur à vous !
Hey you're from France ? I love those kind of mask but can't find it anywhere, where did you buy it ?
Awesome!
Good luck to you two!
match made in heaven with outfits and all <3
So cute! She looks a lot like Adelaide Kane. :-)
Congrats on young love! Where is that striped dress from? I adore it.
Wich is you but im very happy for u guys
This should be in r/MadeMeSmile !! Love seeing people finding love
You are an adorable couple!
I think it’s super duper adorable when people wear matching outfits, and you two have a good sense of style!  
I really like the bottom left dress, it’s very cute!

I hope you have lots of fun together!
Love the dudes tattoo! You guys look happy. Congrats.
All the best!
Wow you guys are both really good looking! Congrats on finding someone during such a hard time.
Nice one. Good luck guys 😊👍❤️
Wow you both have a great sense of fashion! You’re a lovely couple, and I hope you have many fashionable and fun date nights out and about!
So cute! Happy for you guys 🤗
Congratulations ! Y’all make a cute couple very good looking pair
Beautiful couple! Also his/your forearm tattoo is so unique and interesting
Super cute and heartwarming
You two are cute as fuck. Lol
So cute!
I thought I hated matching outfits. I was very mistaken! Thanks for showing me the light,and you looks so cute
I met someone online during lockdown as well and I’m nervous to meet him cause I don’t think I’d be able to keep my hands off of him and wear a mask at the same time
Y’all gonna make Super cute babies 😊
I don't say this often but you two are hella cute! Even more so together
I ship it
You both are a beautiful couple and it’s wonderful that you got the chance to get together after meeting and getting to know each other during such interesting times. Wishing you both so much happiness and love and thanks for sharing your joy with us!! We need more happy stories like yours 🤗♥️
Nice! I've been in a power wheelchair for 15 years, and I dated my now-wife 2.5 year before I could convince her to marry me. She's now writing a book called "my husband is lame" to tell our story, but also to talk about a lot of the questions she had about what life married to a wheelchair person is like. Most of what can be found online is frustrated posts about the hard times, and not nearly enough about what the good times or even just the regular times in between are like.

Anyway, I know this was just a first date. But if ever you or he have any questions feel free to PM me to talk shop. No question is too personal ;).
[deleted]
You need a short film made for you “Love in the Time of Covid”
You are a disgustingly beautiful couple: I’m going to go away and have a cry now.
Congratulations! Although, that orange-striped dress deserves so much more than a hoodie!
I like that you went with the basic black and white. It was my favorite
Y'all have an a amazing sense of fashion!
You both are so cute! I love it and wish you both the best!
You both have such impeccable style. I am HERE for it.
I would watch you two on a tv show, you guys are a gorgeous couple!

I LOVE EVERY INCH OF THIS CONGRATS!!!!!
This is the wholesome love i live for.
You are both so stunning, best wishes in your future endeavors :)
And like most men he has one nice pair of shoes lol y’all are cute!
Just got to say you two are incredibly cute together! I love all of the dresses. And his tattoo on his arm, from what I can see of it, looks really really cool. Best of luck to both of you and I'm so happy that you found each other ♥️
This guy over here finding a smokeshow during quarantine and I can't even find toilet paper.

r/streetwear
How does this happen ? Fuck I’m completely clueless as to how life works. I wish I could just die in my sleep. Félicitations cela dit.
God this makes me so depressed. I want friends like this but I’m anxious and I use that as an excuse to feel sad about things I can change, but every time I want change the motivation just isn’t there.
I was needing some good wholesomeness in my life today and this gave me the biggest smile.

Of course, now I need to get off the internet for the rest of the day to preserve the feeling.
That’s a good looking couple
This is awesome. Sorry about the rude people. I don't know what their problem is. Hopefully I can cancel them out a little! I hope you're very happy together.
Dude, you are together now. Take off your mask. Take off her mask.

Now kiss the girl 🥰 !

Don't forget to post a follow-up picture.
Super happy for you two! My boyfriend lives in France and I’m stuck in the US for... well, the foreseeable future since it’s pretty much gone to shit over here. we’ll be spending our one year in different countries. Enjoy the time you have together! ❤️❤️❤️
Ok you two aren't allowed to be that cute AND happy. That's cheating, and frankly I'm calling the authorities
How do you decide which had to put on which hip?
What sneakers is he using on the top right picture?
So cute!!! Thanks for sharing, definitely needed this dose of positivity today!! Congratulations!!
Been having a stressful week at school, thank you for this wholesome image.
That's sweet. Hope this lasts a very long time. Best wishes!

Nobody cared who I was until I sat in the chair.
You've confirmed my suspicion that everyone in France is both extremely attractive and effortlessly fashionable, so congrats for that as well as your new relationship ❤
This is so damn cute and wholesome, wishing you all the best!

Owwww, vous êtes trop mignon  ! ❤️😍💐
This makes me so happy.   You guys are so cute and I know you haven't known each other long,  but do you think he is the one?  The way you guys seem,  I wouldn't be surprised.  I love when someone finds their person.  Maybe because I found mine after being with someone who wasn't my person,  and it just makes it that much sweeter.   I wish you two all the best!!
She’s really cute bro. Best of luck to you both. Buss it open.

LOVE THIS!
You guys are cure im jealous haha
So we went with outfit number 2? Or was that the third and just the same day as he came to visit?
too cute @_@
You guys are a super cute couple!
Aww that’s so cute!! And I love your tattoos man! They look sick! Can we see a close up of it ?
Wait, one can get to know girls without leaving the house? There is a chance - at last
How are you both so exceptionally attractive
C'est trop mignon 😭❤️

I am so happy for you both, may you both be blessed with much love and happiness xoxo
ohh how beautiful couples
Lovelyy
Do I spy Nujabes & Wu Tang vinyls? Bueno taste 👌🏽👌🏽also y’all are cute
Y'all are so adorable. Also, white top, black pants is best of the three first date options IMO. The orange stripe dress would be good for a second date getting lunch or spending time in the park, the black/dark blue dress would be good for a nighttime romantic dinner or a social gathering. When those are allowed to happen again of course.
You two are the cutest. Love that 36 chambers album he has! Reminds me that I still need to get that record on vinyl
Your guy doesn't happen to be from Wenzhou by chance?
Y’all are the god dang cutest. I’m going to invent a shrink ray so I can shrink the both of you down and carry you two around in my pocket all day. Cool?
This is awesome! Congrats y’all and best of luck!
Omg you guys are so cute! I wish you lots of happiness together ☺️
Cute
That’s so inspiring!
Omg ! Vous êtes très mignons ! 🥰🥰

Coucou de 7e de Paris !
I know this isn't the point of this post but can anyone advise where her red stripy dress is from? It's so gorgeous!

Happy for you OP, this is such a cute lockdown story.
Love seeing that Nujabes record on the shelf. Best of luck to you two!
Bro if you don’t call her hot wheels then I don’t know what to tell you. 

Congrats to you both!
Congrats OP! This is cute and all but I can’t take my eyes off the Nujabes and Wu Tang records in the background...those are straight sexy!
c'est très romantique X
Wow, vous faites un très joli couple!
Needed to read something like this today, congrats guys.
This has to be one of the most wholesome things I’ve ever seen on the internet. I wish you both happiness, best of luck!
how did you two meet?
Adorable!
Great!
Love the tattoos!
This is awesome. Happy for you two
Great couple!  Sante!
Congrats, you two should listen to that Nujabes record in the background!
This is the cutest shit I've ever seen
There are some dumbasses in this comment section.  Jesus Christ.
I'm just here to talk about that red and white dress/black and white shoes combo and how good it is.
This is sooooo cute omg 😍
This post was warm and fuzzy, it made me smile. So happy for the two of you!
I thought that was Steven Lim from BuzzFeed
Félicitations! Je vous souhaite beaucoup de bonheur! ❤
So cuteee
Where is my love story? 😣😣 I'm seriously having a hard time rn but it makes me happy to see such a beautiful new couple
One word of warning.  Now you said Merci, so that's French.  Now if she is French, then I have to warn you about the french raised eyebrow.  My best friend does that when she's about to kick my ass for saying something stupid.  Which happens a lot, ya know.  lol
Noice.
nujabes! appears you found a man of culture. also your wall art is awesome.
Cool way to meet!
😍
My recent/current gf and I did the same thing, first date planning and all! It's the best feeling being able to see the person you've been talking to for so many months.
Wish I could find a boyfriend, ya'll are adorable.
I really love the geometric colourful pattern on your wall!

Where did you get that striped dress?! It’s so cute!!! 

(Also you two are adorable and I’m happy for you but also jealous of that human connection and your functioning government response...)
Congrats 🥳
Grats! She is so pretty.
This is great! I always love seeing love stories that start on the internet. I met my wife on an MSN chatroom in late 2001, when it was still "crazy" to find love on the internet... 

We've been officially together now for 17 years and married for 16. Best of luck to you both and I sincerely hope things work out!
This man is cute af. lol.
Every cloud has a silver lining and though the Pandemic you have found yours! Hope you are very happy together! 😊
Did she paint the wall behind her? I’ve always wanted to do that augh

I’m happy for you and hope you two have more fun together. Thanks for sharing this with us
I love this.  Love love love this
This is the cutest thing I've seen today...
Actually, this whole year.

You both just gave me hope for my own relationship. Long distance for nearly two years, and we are still trying to get the means of seeing each other in person for the first time. Of course, Covid-19 delayed things heavily(we were so close to having everything ready for visiting each other), and health problems have occurred since for the both of us, but we're still trying! I can't wait to see him finally 😭 He wants so bad for me to meet his mom, and I look forward to it too 💜

You two are also adorable with the matching outfits! I wish you both long happiness and that you both thoroughly enjoy each others company 😊

Cheers! 💜
You two looks so cute! Also love that Nujabes album.
Congrats.  To a most fashionable couple
Congratulations
Massive congrats to the both of you! 

Nice to have a bit of good news in these times! :)
All the very best to both of you.
Stop wearing your damn shoes in the house.
You two are so cuuuute!
I spy a 36 Chambers record in one of his pics.
Beautiful couple! Life is a lot more fun when you have someone to share everything with. The best advice I have is to be kind, keep your sense of humor, and never put anything above your relationship. My relationship has lasted over 30 years.
MY HEART
I hope you guys wheel chair the key to happiness for the rest of us who need it!
This is so wholesome! Thank you for sharing!
I've never seen someone sitting so elegant in a wheelchair! Wish you both a lot of happiness!
Omg you look just like my friend who happens to be a bomb ass artist Stephanie Monty
She’s stunning. You’re.... well you’ve covered your face but that hair is awesome! 
Congrats and many years happiness to you both
Wish you guys the best!!
This is too cute and made my day. 🥰🥰🥰 Also can I have your wardrobe madamoselle? Très chic!
E,c it's d do s so dragging xs,sss xx, z
Gorgeous! And that red and white outfit is EVERYTHING! 😍✨
Love this. Noticed: Nujabes, Wu, Spider-Man, and fresh kicks.... Are we best friends?
I wish I could double upvote for the Wu-Tang
Yooo I spot a metaphorical music vinyl 😍 nice cop!
How is your English so good?  I've been living in Canada for several years now and still communicate like a French stereotype.
Bonjour à vous. My ex left me right before the lockdown and I've been feeling down since then as I let myself fall in the rut of thinking it was not a time to meet new people. Seeing a story such as yours is inspirational and I would like to thank you for showing it's possible not to feel so alone in the times of social distancing. You make a cute couple and I wish you all the best together.
🥺 That is beautiful!
ngl, those outfits are dope! so happy for you guys!
Were you in French prison?
Two beautiful human beans :)
I know I'm late to the thread and you probably won't see this, but I saw in an earlier post you had a scar down your back. Do you have Spina Bifida?
Nujabes in the back! Hell yeah. You guys both look great btw
so cute you guys.
God bless you
Reading your responses you are a really wholesome person.

Much love to you two!
we're not as cute but my guy and i just did the same!!! dating online during quarentine was such a trip!!
Stunning couple..gratz 👍
You know what? I'm just going to come out and say it, the lack of a 4th matching outfit is disappointing.
I remember seeing you post a pic awhile back and I loved your matching outfits then. Is it weird that I feel like a proud parent seeing you're finally able to meet in person? Congrats and wish you every bit of happiness!
She likes the hand on hip pose
Ugh... that dude is so cute
Félicitations !
Lucky you, he's cute!
Can I get some style and aesthetic pointers from him?
This is hands down the best story to come out of coronavirus. Cheers to your beautiful new relationship!
Trop contente pour vous, vous êtes trop chouuux !
Happy wheels
Vous êtes trop mignons ❤
Plein de bonheur à tous les deux

Strange question, but where do you get that style of mask? Where it’s not an elastic but rather fabric that goes around your ears
You both have dope wardrobes
This is very endearing. Have fun guys.
Such a cute couple!!! Precious!
What can I say, but... Awwww!
Omg you two are so cute!!!

In a similar-ish situation myself. We're getting together sometime this week.

My god, what a cute couple
Omg I love this
Painfully beautiful couple, the smiles say it all. 'grats to you both
What is up with his shoe laces? I like the laced but not tied look, but question the walking integrity.

Nice
I've been trying to learn French. How do you say "this is really goddamn cute"? 😍
It's nice to see there are still good things happening in the world. Wish you both the best, thanks for sharing your story
 I love your wall!
I hope he wheels you around, because I sure would
So cute!!!!!
You guys look so cute together! I love the matching outfit pictures!
God, you guys are a beautiful looking couple.
And I just love the wholesomeness of this! I wish you the best ❤️

In front of the same awesome wall!
ok that's adorable
i love this!!!!! 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
Siete una bellissima coppia !^((You're a beautiful couple, in italian))
I'm soooo glad people meeting online isn't mocked like it was 10 - 15 years ago.  it's such a great tool and couples like this may never have the chance to meet without it!

You guys are adorable!
You both look really happy and I admire your idea with the matching outfits and so on.
Wish you all the best!

P.S.: love the wall art, great color scheme
Longue vie à votre couple 🤗
Congrats!! Am i the only one who thinks she looks like MBB
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Think the algorithm found your street styles 100% compatible! Congrats
Congratulations wishing you two all the best
Congratulations!
Upvoted for both of you and that Nujabes record in the back.
Is this Joe Inoue, or just his Doppelgänger?
Wow this is beautiful!
kinda want to see die down.
You guys are adorable!! Nice fits
Love this!!!
you guys are so cute together ☺
Shit man, I'm on the verge of something similar. You just got me even more excited than I was previously. Congratulations btw.
Holy shit I love your wall
You two are an adorable couple and both have such a great sense of style. Congrats to you two! ❤️
That orange couple's outfit is just asking to be worn outside on a lovely summer day. I hope you get to do that soon! Best of luck!
So cute!!😍
I started quarantine dating someone. We would hang out in parks and stuff when they opened those and it’s been going really well. It’s been about 3 months of Saturday’s that we have spent together at this point and... I guess I like her.
What did you guys do for your first date? :D

(Also you both look lovely and I wish u both all the best ❤️)
I am very happy for you guys
Aww, that's so sweet! I spent the last few months getting to know someone as well, but then yesterday they told me that I had no personality and dropped me like a hot brick :)
Lucky fella!
Omggg!! Eternal love and happiness to you both!!!
So cute! But surely you could buy a wheelchair with some sort of torso support. Isn’t it painful holding yourself up like that all the time?
Absolutely adorable 💕 Best wishes for y'alls future!
