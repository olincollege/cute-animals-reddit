Walk softly, carry a big stick.  *check*
Now you have to throw it for him.

EDIT: Wow almost 10k upvotes my most ever, thank you tippy tapper, and everyone. 
I hear the 'tinka- tinka' of two high piano keys as I watch him run...
That dog can definitely kick my ass in a fight.

Love the fact that he can balance this massive stick
Wow so cute, I love tiny little steps, his is making 
Birds be checking him out like "where the f**k was this beast when I was building a nest"

And this is how the Wright brothers got their idea
I don't know if ya wanna call him a proud boy....
What an Absolute Unit
Something about that doesn't look right...

Looks like vfx.
Apex hunter. Giant bison over the horizon.
Now that's a beautiful repost :') 
that's an unfortunate nickname for such an awesome little pupper
Grabbing the limb at the dead center is admirable.

The pride in the gait is just beautiful.
You know, this really makes me think about the functional uses of fetch. You, caveman, must tend to fire, but need more sticks. Good doggo solves this problem
He looks like a little plane coming in to land. 
Is it just me, or does the stick... BRANCH sort of look photoshopped?
I don’t mean to shit on anyone’s parade but this is definitely CG, right? Everything looks fake to me. Plus the right side of the stick he’s carrying somehow phases into the ground? Idk. Not that that makes the video any less enjoyable. It’s just jarring to me.
He looks like he’s about to set off on the first flight
The only proud boy worth keeping.
Pretty sure its fake. Right tip of the stick disappears when it touches the ground. Still cute though. 
Now let's see the dog navigate with that giant stick across a narrow foot bridge.
I thought of the Wright brothers

Damn scary! Why does the stick disappear into the ground though, why the edit?
Looks fake. The right side of the log goes into the ground
Don't wanna get bit by a dog with that mouth strength
Did he take down that tree as well?
My dog does those same little quick steps when he's carrying a heavy stick/log, I love it.  There's a big felled branch on our walking path which is about the size of a large Christmas tree, and every day he has a go at bringing it home.
throw it
It's like a real life Super-Pikmin

I would die if I carried this... this dog is better than me
Doggo landed safely despite high cross winds.
Where did he find that in the empty field...
That's a good stick!

This honestly made my day. Pupper looks so proud fetching that stick! 
Those little legs
Looks like me trying to run into the house while holding too many groceries.
How far did he carry that thing?! The only tree nearby is off in the distance. 
Does this count as r/tippytaps?

This is my stick. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My stick is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. My stick, without me, is useless. Without my stick, I am useless. I must fetch my stick true. I must fetch quicker than retrievers and spaniels who are trying to steal from me. I must fetch sticks before they fetch before me. And I will.
I've literally said this before and here I find myself saying it again...what's with these gifs of dogs with photoshopped oversized-sticks?
my brother's border collie loooooved fetch. on walks she would find sticks and bring them to us to throw for her. walking along the beach there's a telephone pole-sized tree that had washed up. she stops at it, looks hard, then looks back at me. i give her the dog head turn. "what?" she looks back at the "stick", then back at me with the "this-one-seems-good look". i say, "yeah. probably not". she continues her search for a good throwing stick
Too bad it’s a fake. 
I once had a staffy like this. She would also obsessively lick paint off walls and dive for rocks, massive rocks. Best dogs. 
This is funny but fake look at the right of the stick it sinks into the ground. 
Perfectly balanced 
Awww...he is such a cutie pie!  Now how are you going to throw it so he can fetch it again??
This is almost the perfect little gif for what I've been looking for nearly all night. Thank you for finally allowing me to rest.

Good doggo and human
Tipping forward and walking on his front 2 legs is the only thing that could improve this video.  But, omg, I love!
#SPEED WADDLE

This is one of the first times that I legitimately can't even. 
To all of the people who think this is fake you should spend more time with dogs.  There was a dog in my neighborhood who would drag trees like that out of the river.  My medium sized female dog regularly picks up logs her own weight.  Dogs are very strong.
Yeah, edited. Watch the stick go through the ground at the beginning. 
Every time I see this, I look at my pibble and think "yep, I could see her doing that." 
It’s so much bigger than he is!

You walk into the club and this dude slaps your girl’s ass. Wyd?
Not going to lie, saw the title and thought I’d get to see one of those douchey white nationalists get a beat down. Not totally disappointed with what I got but hopes were still dashed. 
Maybe it’s just a tiny dog with a normal sized stick.
I'm impressed that he found the exact balance point of the log. Most humans couldn't do that.
So that's how the pyramids were built. They had dogs do all of this stuff... 
Tippi tap tippi tap tippi tap tippi tap tippi tap tippi tap
So this is how you get abs. 
Just a thought, but could it be that dogs where once used to fetch materials in primitive construction?
It looks like he is barely keeping his back feet on the ground.
That's not gonna fit in the car.

How is the camera so still? I would be cracking the fuck up, no way it would be a watchable video. In any case, G O O D B O Y E !

This makes my teeth hurt
I always thought that dogs were domesticated to help with hunting, fending off attackers, etc.

These are masculine endeavors.  

I just suddenly realized that maybe that's a long-con cover story because the real reason they got so friendly with us is that they'd bring firewood to the women to start a fire.  
He's gona be disappointed when his human can't throw it very far...at all lol
lol. Have fun throwing that for him!
Excellent command of pitch yaw and roll on this pupper 
It's like a kid finding a dog. "Can i keep it? Can I keep it?"
The sheer force of dogs never ceases to amaze me.

If I had to carry a proportionally large object I would probably stumble and pierce myself through in a matter of seconds.

Either that log is dry as hell or that dog has some proper jaw strength.
That's actually a propeller, it's rotation has synced up to the camera shutter speed. Rotary engined pups are an amazing thing to see in the wild. 
Lol so funny 
Seems like a great trait to select for if you were trying to pick wild dogs into your tribe. 

Good cave dog traits
- hunts
- protects
- grabs wood to burn and build with
- fluffy cuddles 



good luck throwing that very far 
Kind of looks like a bone mustache. 
Someone needs to edit it so he takes off. 
Look at the tippy taps, so determined, so excited 
Do you guys think dogs’ obsession with sticks is due to a biological drive base in selective breeding to help us gather firewood? 
Again?
Awww
A friend’s dog did something like this - after a big storm I took him for a walk in the park, and he found a sapling that had been totally blown out of the ground.  It was a bit thinner, but still had roots and all the branches and leaves and he had to drag it over but he was so Proust of himself!  I was very sorry I couldn’t throw it for him, but I did tear off a branch for him instead. He was a skinny spaniel cross too, so it was quite impressive he managed it. 
I instinctively protected my shins. My doggies didn't raise no fool!
This should be some kind of world record
He has a proud walk.
Stick? That's a tree branch.
That dog's name? Gavin McInnes. 
What’s the psychology behind this?
Sometimes I wonder if cavemen genuinely appreciated things like this. Like that’s basically free housing material you didn’t have to lug, right? Or firewood. I bet the first dog to bring a guy a big stick got a pretty great response.
Fake

'comment about bite and neck strength of the pitbulls' 
My Staffie did this all the time, never found one this big though!

Quick story. Leon (as was his name) obviously loved his sticks and in the forest we took him for walks in was a rope swing. For whatever reason he'd always ignored it till one day he suddenly bolted out of the car door ran in the direction of the swing. I'd probably lost him for a good couple minutes and much to my amusement when I did find him he was hanging in mid air on the swing (made from a nice long solid stick) swaying back and forth. Wish we had mobile phone video cameras in those days, but it was hilarious.
He would not let go of it either.
He's just working out...
He looks so proud and happy :D
Top dog gets the upvote. I actually laughed out loud thank you
I'm hearing theme from The Dambusters movie
Dog: Throw this one muthaf***er!
That’s some determination. His face is screaming “fuck this is ripping out my teeth, but fuck! what a catch, check this shit out human!”

I hiked for 28 days in the Northern Siskiyous with a dog who looked and acted like this. Spent 28 days of getting thwacked on the calves by the good girl hauling logs while running past everyone.

Had balanced so well, almost like it never bounces lol.
Tell me which toothpaste and toothbrush!
Seems right.

A friend’s pit that was about the size of a small horse loved to get a downed branch or log and bring it over to you like it was fetch time.

Good demo of how they are terrifying lumps of jaws and muscle, but are just as much of a derp as any other breed.
Now you’ll have to reward him with a treat just as big.. Just... do it.
