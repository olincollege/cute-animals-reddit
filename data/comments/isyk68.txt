Now he's Sir Hobo Highwaters, but he's never forgotten where he came from.
He still looked pretty majestic on the streets
He is beautiful!  Thank you for taking him in!

an article about him:  [https://www.cattitudedaily.com/once-a-lonely-alley-cat-now-mr-hobo-highwaters-gets-a-chance-to-shine](https://www.cattitudedaily.com/once-a-lonely-alley-cat-now-mr-hobo-highwaters-gets-a-chance-to-shine/?fbclid=IwAR1TM2_TABTgZpNO2kRNN30I8czXvQdRg4-moG4xgjwlD2Eg4yfH5NCLoAA)

From the article:  "Anthony Di Sano is a man who really loves cats. He lives in Rhode Island which is known for harsh New England winters, and his heart goes out to the alley cats which are forced to live outside with no place to call home. But he feeds them, and tries his best to care for them. In exchange, he gets the opportunity to photograph them and hopefully earn their trust.

One day when doing his alley cat duties, he noticed a beautiful white cat that really caught his eye. This cat was not your average alley cat. There was something special about him that made him look as if he really didn’t belong there. Anthony couldn’t get this cat out of his mind. He need to help him, and give him a home where he could be pampered, loved, and cared for. So, he made it his mission to win over his trust. And \*spoiler alert\* it worked!"
A Prince was chosen
It's nice to see that wince in his eye gone. I know that wince. That's the stress of fear and survival.
Now he's Mister Boho Highwaters...nothing Hobo about this dapper gent!
There was a balrog inbetween that before and after pic
This dude had 10 tons of dirt in him
What a pretty boy!
Also, the picture on the left is great. I know he's far less healthy there, but aesthetically speaking, with the lighting and background, it's brilliant. Like, that cat looks like it's the grimy main character in an action movie.
Wow ....Such a beauty ...What great transformation...Glad he has a good home!!
Good for you Smelly Cat, you deserve it.
My first thought was Gandalf the Gray vs. Gandalf the White. Anyone else?
You did a great job
This cat reminds me of that santa as a model guy with the white beard.

Such brilliance, such floof! Mr. Highwaters is indeed a gentleman!
Trading places.
Here's an article about Mr. Hobo Highwaters with more pics:

https://www.cattitudedaily.com/once-a-lonely-alley-cat-now-mr-hobo-highwaters-gets-a-chance-to-shine/

> “His personality in The Alley was totally different than it is today. In the Alley he was always mean and hissing, swiping at me at any given moment. Once saved and brought inside, everything changed. His hair grew long with a huge mane, and now loves to be touched and plays constantly. He likes to sleep on his back and likes his belly rubbed while doing so. Craves attention and seeks it. Headbutts, licks and sometimes rabbit kicks happen all day.”

What a beautiful cat!
That is a beautiful kitty and his name is fantastic!!
What a beautiful cat! He looks just like this shiny porcelain cat statue that my grandparents had in their apartment. I wonder who has it now since they're gone.
/r/beforenafteradoption

I think!
What a beauty
King of the Streets!
Mr Highwaters approves of his change in circumstance, he is now living the life he was born to live
He must’ve fought a demon and saved a bunch of hobbits
Majestic
Lovely beast...
that is tywin catister
That looks like a Turkish Angora! We rescued an injured scrawny black kitten of the same breed, he grew into a magnificent bastard. They really are beautiful cats!
the Great Catsby
My cats name is hobo! She is the girl hobo :)
He was a brave soul out on the streets now he’s simply living the good life
I know the photo on the left is just a dirty cat, but I kind of like how he sort of has a gritty fallout look to him there. The after photo makes him qualified for a live-action disney remake of the Aristocrats or something of the sort.
Majestic little dude found his forever home, I love seeing stories like this
I adopted 2 Turkish Angoras from the MSPCA 10 years ago- they are so beautiful and wonderful!!!
Fuckin Spectacular!!
This is a magnificent cat! Thank you for rescuing him.
Fresh Prince Of Bel Air
He cleans up well.
Looks like a cobra on pic 2
He sounds like a hobbit
You did such a good thing.
what a glow up
Majestic. No other words from me.
Wow, that is one elegant cat. Something must have happened to put him suddenly out on the streets. Glad you gave him a happy home.
What do you actually call him when you're calling him over to you? I've always wondered that when people name their cats weird/long names.
I wish I could take in every stray cat I saw
Falcor!
Get this cat a top-hat and monocle, stat!
BEST. NAME. EVER.
I feel as though that left most photo is totally staged by OP
Glorious kitty. Great name. Bet he has nice pantalones.
r/beforenafteradoption
Omg that is one majesic unit of a cat!
Love that change of facial expression too.
He came back as Catdalf the White
Name and surname! 🤓
This is what I like to see! Not pictures saying ‘look at this cute stray cat’, pictures saying ‘look at this stray cat I took home and loved’.
He cleaned up good
Regal!
This makes my heart so very happy!🦋💗💗💗💕💕
Mans went from ashy to classy
My current foster is from the streets. Had him 2 weeks and he is already a totally different cat. We just need to get the stitches out, his whiskers to grow back and add about 4 pounds before we can take an after photo and put him up for adoption.
so cute !
Thank you for putting the before picture on the left. You don't even know. Sincerely, everyone.
👍🏼 cat
He cleans up quite well 🎩
Gandalf the grey to Gandalf the white.
WTF I have the exact type of cat who's name is also hobo. This is freaky...
From ashy to classy. <3
Wow he cleaned up the street and took a bath, what a great cat.
Majestic then Majestic now!
That’s what I call a glow up
Now call him Sir Hobo Highwaters
Nice
Sorry but to you its Sir Hobo Highwaters
Brightness: +36
Mr. Hobo the grey -> Mr. Hobo the white
Wow what a glow up 🤩
glorious. it's like you've adopted a  former warrior. and when he was taken care of, it was revealed that he was a king.
Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you ...
I love when I just find a random Turkish Angora :)

Gorgeous cats.
Handsome boy! So good you’ve taken him in!
What a glow up <3
Look at this distinguished gentleman, mmm yes how distinguished
He is Majestic!!
You knew me as Catdolf the Grey. I return to you, at the turn of the tide, as Catdolf the White.
Maximum fluff
He looks like a very proud cat
cute
A rather Gellical cat, that.
Wow, so mucb fabulouseness
what a good boy
Mr Hobo you are a fucking STUD my man
My father saved a cat just like this about 30 years back. It was badly ill and coughing and had gone under my father's garden compost heap to probably die. My father fed it every day, and it somehow got better. It used to come out of the compost heap after a week or so to eat, then one day it just appeared on his back doorstep and came in.

It was a grubby white like this cat, and had a lump of road tar stuck to the tip of it's tail. It took a couple of weeks to be able to get it's trust to clean it up, and we eventually cut the lump of tar away from it's tail.

&#x200B;

That cat was magnificent! None of my father's other cats would dare fuck with it, it just treated them fairly but firmly.

The interesting thing was, this cat was one of the only cats I've ever seen that expressed gratitude! After it had been fed(First in line of course) it would come and find you and sit next to you or on you for about 15 mins, quietly, and then move on.....

One day it pretty much came to say "goodbye and thanks" in "cat"(know idea how to express it any other way?) and wandered off and we never saw it again. It just moved on.

&#x200B;

I'll say it again.... that Cat was magnificent!
First pic: forces young street kittens to give up their milk money so he can buy catnip from Shady Sam down at the wharf.

Second pic: Gets steady modeling gigs, face is used in L'oreal shampoo commercials, regularly jets off to St.Tropez with Luna, Chloe and Princess. Helps fight COVID through his humanitarian projects.
*...on the streets and meow.
He reminds me of Snowbell from Stuart Little.
Mr Majestic
Such a badass on the street, and now he’s like “oh I’m a respectable citizen”
he so belongs on r/ronpearlmancats
Was it difficult to catch him? I’ve been trying to coax a beautiful feral to come and settle down to a good life with me, feeing him, making a warm weatherproof shelter for him but he won’t Coe in.
He looks so good now
Royalty!
Majestic!
This melts my heart. So beautiful.
Honestly he still looks pretty good even on the street hes just dirty.
Clin boi
So the before is Mr. Hobo Lowwaters?
I am a movie star
That's one pretty cat.
Look at you man looking good clean as white healthy like a rich cat!
So that's what happened with Gandalf
Majestic floof
What a handsome fella ❤️❤️
Mr. Highwaters because he ain't a hobo anymore!
Love, love, love this
asthetic 100

cute 100

photo 100000000

cat 100000000000000^(10000000000000000)
My idiot brother and his ex tried breeding cats like this once. They failed miserably, both cats ran away. Not long after, our neighborhood had the fanciest looking strays around. I'm glad you gave this Sir a home.
He looks amazing god bless him
Best name ever for a rags to riches story.
Lord Highwater now
Majestic fluffy boi!
That is the most beautiful cat I've ever seen. What a little king.
You can tell this cat has royal bloodlines. That posture screams ‘regal’
Mr Hobo Highwaters looks like Judi Dench
I like that there is Fiji in his hideout, dude thats some 2€ 500ml water
What a majestic beast
Wow
The new definition of a glow-up
I sure wish a bath and some loving made that much difference on me.
Damn this is the first post I’ve seen hit 100k upvotes
Elegant AF
He looks battlehardened
Floofy!
The owner of Mr Hobo thinks of some very unique cat names, I love it
This cat’s bougie as hell he was drinking Fiji even on the streets
“That’s Sir Hobo Highwaters to you, peasant”
- him probably
He is a white wizard now
YAY!! I’ve missed your fb posts!
Gandalf the white
I am glad little King 👑found his 🏰
Majestic.
Incredible.  Simply incredible.  But i'd have called him Aslan the White.  Look at that regal pink lil snout
That is one gorgeous glow up.
SO HANDSOME!!!!!
he glowed up very well.
handsome cat 🥰looks like royalty to me
From the alley to the throne room.
He looks kinda like a cobra
I like the name and the cat
Don't forget to vote for him on America's favourite pet. He passed through the first round as number 1 and is now number 1 in the second round.
Even though I’m insanely allergic to cats, I’d love to have a big floofy one like this.
Pretty sure this is a magic card
That flow is so magnificent, it even shone through when that boy lived on the streets.
One can see he had a hard life in the first picture, the second picture...what a difference. He looks like a prince.

Its sad to think some animals have to struggle like that, terribly sad as it relates to people as well.
Interesting how...if you care for an outcast and show it some love it can change and be rehabilitated.

*Yes, I am talking to YOU American 'justice's and incarceration system for profit.
IT’S A CLOUD!!!!!!
Wowza
The Brad Pit of Street Cats..
To this day u can hear the cat whispers..
" was he really homeless..or was he just researching the role that won him an Oscar ?"
 For his Portrayal of
"Cornelius Fluff "
In
" Alley Cat Gang Wars.. Fluff Couds of Triumph"

He does his own stunts.. But has a body double for the sex scenes bcuz he's feline HIV positive..
He's completely dedicated to to his activism 
And
" Let them live their furry little lives Foundation"
 Against Catizm and putting kitties to sleep discrimination..
that is one fluffy cobra
Perfect name for a cat or a Hobbit!
“I don’t always cat around, but when I do, I do whatever the fuck I want.” Majestic, just majestic.
He’s a class act.
His fur looks soft and pretty.
Majestic AF
Majestic
Wow, rags to riches story for sure!
Oh my.... simply regal. Thank you for giving him a loving home.
All cats deserve a chance :’(
Hi nice to meet you Mr Highwaters, that’s a very clean coat you have, it looks very soft
He still in the streets. He just clean AF now
Majestic baby
Best name ever 👑
What a gorgeous kitty!  Holy moly!
Dammmn! What a glow up!
The left picture reminds me of the smelly cat video on FRIENDS!
Majestic
Gandolf before and after the Balrog. Lol
I like his name.
He is definitely living the good life now! Well done.
ah yes look at this distinguished gentleman
Aww such a beautiful cat ☺️❤
What a beautiful animal. And he knows it too
Awwwww so cute ❤️
Majestic
Mr. Highwaters. What a fantastic name for a cat. Bad ass
What a handsome man cloud
That cat is fancier than me
What every woman wishes they can do for that man in their lives
Damn, what a glowup
Now that's a come up. Such a pretty kitty
Majestic AF!
I know someone who has a beautiful all white Maine Coone. If the cat goes outside she comes inside looking like the photo on the left. We always joke she’ll never get kidnapped because she looks like a dirty street cat.
FLOOFY
That’s a rags to riches story!
Staged as fuck man... there’s no way there was an empty sofa can where you conveniently placed a water/food bowl
My cat had Mr. Hobo's look when he first adopted us.  It took 5 visits to the groomer over 6 months to get all the automobile oil off his fur.  He liked to work under cars a lot.

He still gets under cars, but now he gets regular grooming and brushy-brushy, which generally removes the soot and grime he picks up under cars.

Good job cleaning up Mr. Hobo!
Aww
I’m imagining the hell they must have went through to give this fluff a bath
Get that Sir a Monocle and a Top Hat...
He's Lord Highwaters now
He been through some shit
>Mr. Hobo Highwaters. 

Best name ever. 🙂
Goddamn, that is one regal motherfucker.  Even his hair pattern commands respect.
Dapper! 😻
Hi sididi streets with that Fiji water
That’s not a cat that’s Donald Sutherland
Magnificent
This cat lived the plot of pretty woman
Wow! Beautiful!
This is how he looks meow.
Awww what a pretty kitty! 😍
“Mr” for short?
Gorgeous and fluffy!
Ooh very purdy.
From Mean Streets to Clean Feets.
That is an intensely floofy cat.
Jesus Christ, what a majestic cat
He is beautiful
Not a hobo anymore I see. This guys gonna have a great motivational story about how he was from the streets, and how his parents made him the prince that is now before us.
He needs to be stroked and complimented on a daily basis
MAJESTIC 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
KING
My friend has a cat that looks just like him. Awesome cat!
Unbothered, moisturized, in my lane, well-hydrated, flourishing.
Peasant to Prince
King Cobra
Look at those full cheeks!! Just want to pet them!
What a handsome boy he is.
Majestic baby beast
If he were human, the Pope would request an audience with him!
Sir Hobo Highwaters now if you please.
Gandalf is that you?
A majestic beast!
Majestic.
Which breed is this?
Started from the bottom
He looks majestic in both
Such a handsome boy.
Coolest. Name. Ever.
Mr Mandu
Mr Hobo Waters is absolutely magnificent! I would be willing to wake up way too early in the morning to that cat demanding attention
Glad he’s been able to stay away from the catnip and get clean
That cat played you... he’s drinking Fiji water
What you looking at mortal?
Mr. Hobo Highwaters, Esquire.
This looks like the cat that nobody wants to take in but as soon as it looks good, suddenly everyone wants it.
Love this for him! ❤️
I love how high he holds up his head now. Such a transformation. It’s amazing what a little love can do.
It appears he is still on the streets.  ;)
Majestic af
God bless you for rescuing this beautiful creature
Name that cat Billy Ray Valentine cause he “Traded Places”!
looks to still be on a street
Now he's still on the streets just spray painted haha
 Beautiful transformation
My husband gets so peeved at me because he'll go to show me some cat, like Me. Highwaters here, and I already know their name and their rescue story. I can't help it though! Cats are my guilty pleasure and I get to see this sweet baby in my Chonk group all the time.
Gandalf? Yes... That was what they used to call me. Gandalf the grey. That was my name.

... Well I, am Gandalf the white!
Is this cat in Stuart Little
He's a cutie!
Regal kitty.
That cat looks like it has more money than me.
Holy handsomely
He is lovely
/r/SupermodelCats
Wow you got so lucky
Gorgeous!!
Hobo... Hobo? Yes... that was my name, Hobo the Grey.

I am Hobo the White.
In my country a cat as beautiful as that would be snatched and sold stray, or owned. It’s really sad how some people just see these types of cats as products.
Gandalf?
And now Sir Hobo Highwaters.....
Oh, that's Anthony's pretty boi. 💕
What a regal-looking guy.
That’s so weird. My name is hobo highwater, too.
Anthony Di Sano's cat.  He's in a cat fbook page I'm in called Catspotting society.
He lost that fire in his eyes
That was nice of you to clean up the trash around him.
You have come to me in your time of need, bow before me mere mortal.
Majestic AF
From ruff to fluff
/r/supermodelcats would like you to visit
Confident pet
From Trashy  to Classy.
Excuse me, but "HOBO" might be the best name for a cat.
I just stopped to comment that both the name and the cat are glorious.
when Gandalf ascended
That hobo has finally found Moonshine Holler.
Well, aren’t we just a high-falutin’ kitty.
Damn he looks great
Probably your average riches to rags to riches story, but now he appreciates the help, you know, like Overboard.
Wow! He is regal!
He’s handsome
I thought that was Taylor Swift on the right for a second idky...
What a glow up 😍
Mr. Hobo Highwaters has outstanding floof.
Wow, fuckin’ majestic.
I love him 😩😍
I love his proud little face
Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White
Majestic son of a birch
almost 4 million post karma...
Sir Highwaters is a handsome fellow. He looks very loved.
He looks like my cat. Holy shit.
so you just ran him through the washer and dryer to clean him up right 
jokes aside he’s an adorable lil man
Fucking gorgeous
Does he lick himself that clean or did he need a bath? Or is it diet based? Super curious
what an awful name for a cat

what sorta dipshit would name their cat that?
Now that’s a Glow Up
I bet fluffyboi loves a good brushing
In both picture, he looks very wise.
I'll never understand why cats have better names than me
Fucking majestic
I saved a white kitten from the streets and named him maggot. He was the best til my ex wouldn’t let me take him and instead gave him up to the shelter.
Pretty boy
Majestic as fuck.
**fluff**
This is the first cat I can imaging sitting in a chair and stroking a Cat.
Gorgeous
Pic on the right looks like a movie poster
Fucking regal.
Beautiful!
Went from Clint Eastwood, telling some tomcat to get out of his alley; to The Cowardly Lion accepting his metal of bravery.
He’s so regal.
/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption
This made my day 🥺
Handsome cat! Now he look majestic!
He looks like thurstonwaffles.
So cute
He Started from the bottom now he’s here
Aladdin vs Prince Ali
Elegant.  Thanks for that rescue and for sharing.
OG Highwaters 😺
Lost his edge smh.
What a glow up
he reminds me of my male cat <3
Hobo chic majestic vs chic chic majestic
He looks like the hero FBI agent in a TV crime drama... *from a troubled past to the king of undercover, he’s using his street-wise cattitude to nail those ‘nip pushers. Come Hell or Highwaters now streaming on PetFlix*
So, by the looks of the photo, still on the the streets but you got a better camera.
Magnificent!
Someone could a full out blowdry. 

And it's absolutely perfect.... Purrrrfect.
And now who rules thy kingdom?
Ooooo he is so majestic now!! He needs a wee little crown
Very dramatic photo!! Pretty gato
I want to paint him
A diamond in the rough!
Royalty in either world
yayy Hobo! ❤️
fiji seems like the only acceptable water source for him
He still in streets in second photo homie
Before: Judy Dench!
Good for you Smelly Cat, you deserve it.
1st picture: I both sell and take the catnip drug and am a struggling youth just trying to get back on my feet

2nd picture: I’m a catnip kingpin with an innocent cover story, I live a posh lifestyle and help supply the devastating catnip epidemic.
Yes! I needed this today.
Great pics!
What a beautiful cat.
He went from ashy to classy
He was just waiting for you to come along!  I just love it when magic happens:)
He's no longer gandalf the grey!
What a glow up
I hope you let Anthony know that Hobo went viral. This is his cat that he fed outside forever and finally convinced to come live inside with him.
Mr. Hobo Highwaters flares out his hood to intimidate predators.
So Gandalf was in fact a cat
Wow 🤩
King 👑
Majestic.
I love when I see posts like this but then I am always confused thinking about rule No.1 of this sub. This is almost exactly the same as the example given for the rule, and yet it's clearly good content for the sub.
Dapper
That's an amazing glow up.
That cat leads armies.
He is so beautiful!!🥰🥺
Nice name.
I hope he doesn't relapse on all the catnip and squander this opportunity away.
Now he’s mr. snowsnow
Keep them inside
I present to you....DERELICT!!!
He looks how I feel when I know I'm right
It's like you leveled him up to Hobo the White.
Gandalf the Gray to Gandalf The White
This cat looks regal as fuck.
Does he not prefer a specific address, like Your Majesty or The Honorable?
Majestic bb!!!!
so majestic
He was a gangster. Now he’s a pimp. God bless.
That is the best name.
The name just fits so well
Rags to riches.
So majestic
STARDENBURDENHARDENBART!!!!
Beautiful!
Now that is a stunning cat
You should call him Aladdin

Then you can sing him Prince Ali with crappy hamfisted cat related lyrics.
He looked kinda badass on the streets ngl
Get him back on the street.
He looked like Ryan Gosling in Bladerunner.
Plot twist  this is photos reversed
That’s a glowed up cat.
Now Mr. Hobo returns with his manicured nails to absently jingle his purse of gold coins and think about where he came from.
The posture, the glare, the PRESENCE
Me Hobo Highwaters is quite the looker
THIS is what Cats should have looked like.
Looks like my girlfriends cat. You can take the feral cat off the streets, but you can't take the feral out of the cat. Our cat is a very attractive cat but has a horrible attitude. She was found as a stray as a kitten and seriously hisses more than any cat I have ever seen.
Thanks for taking him!
Handsomest of bois 😻😻
Speedwagon before meeting Jonathan and Speedwagon being Oil tycoon
Mr God Dang Majestic more like
Dahell that cat still look good than 99% of street cats I've seen what is he an exiled royalty?
His person is amazing. He photographs and feeds ferals and has rescued several. You can see the difference!
Thats a cool name
In the sheets
Do you actually say Mr. Hobo Highwaters everytime you have to call him? Or does he have a nickname now
He’ll tear you to shreds, but will at least be polite about it now
What a regal feline
Majestic as fluff!
My guy's name is Grandpa. He was a street cat too. Now he lives a life of luxury and has his own personal jungle, for a yard! Good on ya, for giving him a home.
He's both Lady and the Tramp
Lovely cat
The glow up is amazing <3
What race is this? This is one of the most beautiful cats ive ever seen 😁
Hobo LOL high waters 😇😍 big fury beast
He has been returned to his former glory. Just majestic.
Вот бы мне такого котика)
That name is soooo funny 🤩
Prince of the Streets
There is still a hint of the streets in that stare!
Majesty Fluffy
That fur resembles mane! Magnificent!!
Mr. Highwaters gotta meet Ms. Olivia Benson..
i just finished lotr and this is reminding me of aragorn
Love heals!!
Really needs a monocle and top hat to really bring it home
Absolutely majestic.
Part lion for sure.
MAF
True rags to riches story. Kitty worked hard for this.
So handsome!!
You know that cats got hella kittens running around 6 different states.
Thx for this i needed it
One of the biggest glow ups ever. Still adorable as heck!
Aristocat
Gandalf the gray to Gandalf the white glow up
You captured both his essences with his two names. Gosh, he cleaned up well!
So handsome ~~~
Had the same cat but before and after switched. She ran away.
This cat is  either the hidden villian or hero in a disney movie
Bleaching cats isn't safe for them :(
That there is one hell of a cat.
Must have been hard to find a good stylist that would work for mouse heads when he was living on the streets.
"Well I woke up this mornin' with the Highwaters, with the Highwaters, with the high...

Slept all night in the Cedar grove
I was born to ramble, born to rove
Some cats are searchin' for the Holy Grail
But there ain't nothin' sweeter than a brush in my tail"
Truly a nobleman. Rose all the ranks. He's now Sir Hobo Highwaters.
Technically he is still on the street, isn't he?
op posted two different cats and thought we wouldn’t notice 😉
Best glow up of 2020
That's a nice fuckin' kitty right there.
I’m about to go from ashy to classy
Scrappy hobo to Divine Beast right here.
I want a street cat, and I live on the streets.
Look at his face on the left. Class shows itself even on the streets.
[removed]
Beautiful cat! 2 years ago we had one just like this but mostly orange in color, we had to shave him down to get rid of the mats and now we have a mini-lion. His name is Oliver and he is King.
Credit should be given to Brawler & The Alley Cats (@brawlerthealleycat)
Idk it still kinda looks like he’s on the streets.
There is a special place in heaven for the likes of you.
Fuck me that’s one gorgeous cat
He once was Lil Hobo
Me at 7 pm v/s me at 3 am
Shonen anime villain before and after they're recruited to the party
Mr Hobo Highgarden
Look at that mane!
A regal feline.
What a regal creature!
He looked like a badass street cat
The way it looks it's still on the street.
Majestic
And now.... he is fabulous!
Anyone know this breed ? Cause I NEED one ❤
For all the wrong reasons, but still
what a cool name tho
This makes my heart so happy
This looks very much like my Mr. Pickles.
Majestic as fuck
A cat 10/10!
Sounds like a name for a DnD character
Aww he’s so adorable 😍
What a regal looking cat
Looked to do well on the streets. Same cat but dirtier. Street cats I usually see in other countries are a lot more scrawny.
Michaele Jackson before and after
Is he deaf?  Very common in white, blue-eyed cats.  Just curious!
Wow what a handsome guy 😍
10/10 would him ask before pets
Does he have a brother named Heller?
Wonderful transformation
What a majestic and amazing creature ♥️🙏🏻
Looks like he gave up smokin catnip
talk about a glowup
İts not seems like a street cat. Seems like a lion
Was Hobo the Grey now Hobo the White..........
The cat is in good hands. This is good news.
Magnificent fluffer!
What a magnificent floof!!
Nice glow-up.
I want to see a movie about his rise to success
This cat! 😮 So sick. Weird how when he was on the street he looked male, but now he's got a home.. looks a little feminine 🤣🤣 makeover!
it's like a fallen king of the country finally returned.
Majestic
so cute
Cat went from outlaw to regal.
Looks exactly like my lost cat.
You're not in Canberra are you? Lol.
He's so beautiful!
The rags to riches story we all needed
Like the Prince and the Pauper...
Looks like a runaway cat, too majestic to be out on the streets. Thank you for giving him warm home, and love, and service,
Gandalf the Grey v Gandalf the White
Wow majestic AF even on the streets
This is giving me Eliza Doolittle from My Fair Lady vibes
It's like the reverse of Rickety Cricket. Luckily Mr Highwaters only got to level 2 Cricket
goddamn he fancy
Look how proud that handsome cat looks !!
Majestic af..
L'Oréal: Because I'm worth it.
really nice
That's a pure bred he musta have ran away from someone that's a 2k dollar cat
Such a Glorious boy!
Wise and pretty kitty has seen some shit!
Reminds me a lot of my old Raggy, loved that fluffy bugger! Such a handsome boy! 😍
I like the name, but I don't know how to pronounce it.
Just Gandalf things
It's almost hard to believe that this is the same cat.
The phone was also recorded 24/7.
He's like Gandalf the Grey vs Gandalf the White

Aw I had a book when I was little about a gray street cat that turned out to be beautiful when it was washed.
Night and day difference. He looks so much happier.
YAY for Mr. Hobo and my article being featured. He is worthy of all the praise he receives—as is his cool cat dad, Anthony!!

His before photo looks like a Jellicle cat from the Cats live action movie.

That's one white fluffball. Love it!
