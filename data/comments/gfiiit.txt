That made me smile a big smile. How sweet!
Dan McKernan! I went to this guy's animal rescue (animal planet is airing a series about it) and met him and his staff. Beautiful human being. They are all such fantastic people there in Michigan :')

Edit: the rescue is called Barn Sanctuary and the series on Animal Planet is called Saved by the Barn
He has a show called saved by the barn about his animal rescue.
I just got a bird yesterday, so far he just likes screaming at me. But then will happily sit on my arm and watch TV with me.
D‚Äôaww. That is really really sweet!

He kinda looks like a young Hopper from Stranger Things and that makes me love this even more.
posts like this helps me realize how big the world is.

No matter how many time I think to myself "damn this is like the X repost, havn't everyone seen this by now", the comment sections is always filled with people who actually haven't seen it.  It helps me understand how people use the internet differently than I.
My bird is sick, i miss this
"You have strange feathers but I will preen them for you anyways"
So adorable üíï
I took my phone to the bed of my 81 year-old mother and let this vid play twice. She laughed and loved it. Thank you!
Me when my man brings me foods.
I love the way the birb fixes his hair almost as if he is fixing another birb's.
Watched for cute guy
This is one of those posts that you see pretty regularly reposted and I love it every single time! I will never not enjoy seeing this tiny bird snuggle and the way this dude's face just absolutely melts!
Congrats, you‚Äôre a Disney princess now
I got a kitten only a few months ago. I was out of rehab and just got a place living alone again in a new town. When that kitten rubbed its face on my face kind of like this I broke down crying man. It's so nice to feel love.
Both are keeeyyoooot
Never thought I‚Äôd be jealous of a bird... but here I am.
These birds understand love more than you think. 

RIP my cockatiel Josefina, formally Jose until I found out it was a female.
I have a soft spot for tough looking guys doing ‚Äòsensitive‚Äô things like playing with kids/pets, doing arts and crafts, etc.

I am a larger than average dude within introverted personality and RBF which can make me seem like a real asshole sometimes. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm extremely oblivious, and I‚Äôve had situations where I‚Äôve bumped into someone on accident because I was zoning out about some nerd shit and they saw my general appearance and assumed I was doing the ‚Äúshoulder bump someone on purpose to assert dominance‚Äù type thing and I nearly got my face rearranged by a guy with a Napoleon complex at target.

TL;DR(bc I‚Äôm terrible about getting to the point) these types of vids are my favorite ones because I relate to them
He‚Äôs an affectionate pirate
This guy is Dan Mckernan he's an angel who runs Barn Saturday, and rescues all kinds of animals. I randomly found him on Instagram, and then it turned out Animal Planet had recently picked up a show about his efforts called "Saved by the Barn, and it's amazing. You can clearly see how much he loves each and every animal as an individual, and goes to lengths to give them all a loving and happy life. He shares how he went from making a 6 figure salary and being miserable, to helping animals and absolutely loving life.
Ohhh myyyy Goddddüòç
Enough to make a grown man cry
Dusky conures are pretty adorable
awwww...so sweet ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Hopper?
Hey I love you!

*Then why are you just scratching yourself?*

Don't worry about it dude. Just enjoy the ride
This video is of Dan from Barn Sanctuary in Michigan. There‚Äôs a show on Animal Planet featuring his sanctuary called ‚ÄúSaved by the Barn‚Äù. I highly recommend checking them both out!
I've  had people tell me animals don't have a soul, or spirit, and can't love. Im sorry I will never buy that.
It's so sweet when birds do this!

...unless you have glasses. Those need to come right off. You have a slight skin blemish? Little blackhead, or maybe a pimple? Yeah that's getting picked right the fuck outta your face.
I first was around a bird almost 2 years ago, she‚Äôs a yellow necked amazon, hates males (unknown reason why because she was bought around 8 yrs old). Curses like a sailor, says ‚Äúhello pretty girl‚Äù dances for you, drinks coffee every once in a blue moon, and preens (cleans) you. She‚Äôs one of the best creatures I‚Äôve ever been around. So much personality in such a small creature
Anybody else think this guy is extremely handsome? üòç
*heart melts* so much cute
*Writing down in list*

"Birds are awesome"
I think I may have sat beside this fella and his bird on a plane. He was supposed to keep the thing in a carrier but instead, being a bro, he let the bird look out the window.
BIRB
What kinda birb is this
My heart :'(
How did he not start tearing up from that affection?
This man is a treasure
When you find out your crush likes you back.
The bird was just like ‚Äúthe fuck touch me!‚Äù
Tried this with my love birds,  they only try to rip my skin off
Awww! You are now the property of Green Birb
I‚Äôm losing it that is so dang cute I can‚Äôt STAND IT
r/mademesmile
‚ÄúHis reaction when he realizes the human loves him back.‚Äù
the bird was like, "what the hell dude, thats gay... but i liked it. now cmere and lemme give you some sugar"
I'm sure I pull that exact same face when my cat gives me kisses
This is the purest thing. 

So pure that I almost feel bad for sullying it by saying I'd like to rub on him too.
Do pet birds like this shit all around the house and on their owner's shoulder or are they toilet trained?
 That is the face of a man holding back a sudden rush of tears. 

My heart.. it melts...
Why the hell am I crying now
I wish to marry the human and take the birb in as my own
That's the face I'm going to make when I get a girlfriend but most likely with tears
So pure
The absolute bestest of cuddle birb frens (:
He was getting a good scratch on his beard. XD
Closest I'll to feeling this..
Wish.com David harbor
That‚Äôs good ol fashion love right there.
What an affectionate bird
The video where the baby chick falls asleep on the side of his head is even more adorable!
yes! that face rubbing says it all!
This is how a hug feels.
I can't stand birds, but this is rather adorable.
This made me cry! I miss my parrot‚Äôs lovin on me like this. I miss him so much! He passed away in March and life in a quiet pandemic blows. Birb people love and cuddle your bird today!
Hopper is looking great after his trip to Russia!
I just finished living with a roommate who had a pet parrot (green cheeked conure to be specific) over the last year... this was my reaction every day when she flew into my room to cuddle with me. I love her and miss her already. I don't miss her yelling though.
A-DORA-BOWL
I legit screamed aww at the same time he did !

Sooooo sweet
my reaction on seeing this for the 20th time this month :c
Aww he looks like he getting emotional. I love that  for him üò≠
I wish my cat would love me like that..
for those wondering the bird is on the left
I knew Hopper was alive.
Awe, he gone cry
Dee's a bird
Had some real rough mental times due to quarantine this really did bring my mood up though
My bird just shows his affection (and lack of object permanence) by freaking the fuck out when I leave the room for a minute. And then I come back and he gets all stampy until I pick him up.
This is why i love parrots
I find it cool how some humans can build relationships with birds and wild animals. Crazy.
My husband and I just got baby chicks and baby ducks and this made me tear up thinking about them being this sweet someday. I love those little turds so much
Fool... He's devouring him, particle by particle. Run while you can, mortal, he's thirsting for flesh
I usually am afraid of birds, but my neighbor gave me a baby chick and I've been working through that. I love them, and I named him/her Randy. Birds are great. Gross, but great.
Enough to make a grown man cry.

^^Not ^^this ^^grown ^^man, ^^get ^^back ^^in ^^there, ^^tears!
Wiping the spit off
No! Those are manly tears of manhood goddamit!
This guy is so handsome
I love how the bird‚Äôs initially like, ‚ÄúOh shucks‚Äù
Can anyone give me some bird tips? Pretty sure mine is just a cat with wings.
Covid-20: teaser
How many people who liked this will still eat chicken or turkey?
Good looking guy too.
nice nice nice
*When your pet has sufficient brain power to love:* **Loving head-butt.**
I will take one of each, please.
Look at the tiny dinosaur!
The birb started preening his beard omg. Gotta care for my people.
Awesome beard
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs from being cooped up in quarantine or what but I‚Äôve been tearing up at a lot of posts lately...
I don‚Äôt care how many times I see this. I will like it every single time.
And they only groom you if they consider you a part of their flock.
when my bird pressed his beak to my face and made a kissing sound i cried. what‚Äôs even better is i got that first kiss on tape
Man tears right there
He looks like a male version of Brie Larson (it‚Äôs a compliment)
Is this la turtle
‚ô¨:Can you paint with all the colors of the wind? Can you paint with all the colors of the wind!!!!!
That government drone is collecting DNA samples and he doesn‚Äôt even know it
That was cool to watch. Honest emotions .
I‚Äôve never seen such pure happiness on a man‚Äôs face
a true disney princess
He give kiss
Birds dont exist
May I have him as my pet? The bird can come if it likes :)
Didnt know Jax Teller had a sensitive side.
Looks like the back of the bird
Nice
What kind of bird is that
Soo cute and loving
‚ù§‚ù§
This made me smile a lot! Love is the best thing you can ever have in this world
I'm going to cry this is so precious
Okay I got the big, warm fuzzies damn it.
great birdo
My heart just melted...
True love
My bird Zeke with my husband.
Nice
My fiancee's family used to have a parakeet that for whatever reason really took a liking to me.  I was the only person who could get her to fly to my finger or shoulder on command.  She loved to peck at my glasses and try to pull them off my head.  I miss that bird...
Adorable bird.
I want a sun conure so bad, but I know I can‚Äôt commit to that long of a life span. Maybe whenever I get my own place. 

Also had feeding baby birds is perhaps one of the most exciting things I‚Äôve ever done. They get so hyped to see you and they bond so much easier.
Maybe dinosaurs were nice.
I was given a Senegal in my late teens. His owner just didn‚Äôt have the time for him. We instantly bonded and he fell in love with me. A few years later when I went away to university first year he died of a broken heart :( I miss Buddy.
Talk about lovebirds!!
the way he tucked the dudes hair behind his ear I'm cryin
What kind of parrot is this?
I like how he took a second to enjoy the love. So sweet!
All I can think of when I see this...courtesy of Chicken Thoughts.

His face says it all. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sorry, but the bird's reaction was the best part.  


What??? You kissed me??? Aww!!!
My mom has a quaker parrot and it would like to take off my finger.
Animals are truly the best judge of human character. If an animal doesn‚Äôt like you, neither do I.
Thor Hopperson
We had a parakeet that was loving like this, super sweet. I had no idea that parakeets could be affectionate. My wife taught it to perch on her finger and then it became super trusting. The cage was always open and he would chill on my shoulder, preen my hair, and sing in my ear. When my wife was pregnant, he would sit in her cleavage and take naps. Miss that little bird.
This is some wholesome stuff
I  WANT BIRDIE KISSES!!!! I miss my birds....
That's nice but I guess you gotta get used to shit on your shoulders.
This makes me miss my birds. They are a handful, but they are also soft and sweet.
Yes I saved it , watched it 20x‚Äôs too sweet and you seemed genuinely surprised that s/he loves you too. My ‚ÄúTweetie‚Äù‚Äú loves to play in the plastic  baggies anytime one is on the counterüòÄthey are special huh! NAME?
r/
Any relationship with an animal like this is extra special. Communication on the highest levels
What a snuggle bub
What kind of bird is that?
IT'S COMING RIGHT AT YOU DUDE
Hopper made a friend in Russia
This...it does bring me joy
UwU cuute
Birb nibbles should be a spa treatment. Gimme three to nibble on my head while some of those little fish eat the dead skin off my feet.
I would be chessing so hard if I was him
That's a lot of big dad for a lot of little bird ‚ù§Ô∏è
oooh my gosh, so cute!!
I would start crying
Can someone explain why ‚Äúbird brain‚Äù is used an insult, these little feathered fly creatures are so precious
Some people just have natural connections with animals...it‚Äôs like being a Ranger in D&D
I simply love birbs
That bird is like bro tf? I love you too hooman.
Well, now he can say hes experienced true love truly. Animal bonds are an enormous deal.
I went to high school with this guy. Very nice and genuine. Glad to see he's  doing so well!
Paging Dr. Birdlove
Can we please get this video with sound?
Be careful Hop...11 will get jealous.
That‚Äôs what my dog does lol
Best Thing I've seen in the morning. Thanks for this man.
Who says animals can't love?
Awwwwww needed this rn
I swear I thought he was about to cry it's so cute
That is soooo adorable
All that touch my heart right there that's sweet bird you must be a good owner dude God bless your heart
Very sweet but that beak near his eye makes me nervous.
im in tears this is so sweet... :,))
I wish I could be loved like that  (Ôº¥‚ñΩÔº¥)

I usually never liked birds since I had a bad experience with one but this is beyond sweet!

That‚Äôs true love.
We had a parakeet before (died of old age) and yes, that is affection. So precious!
this is the sweetest most pure thing in the universe

Aww sweet birb.
This will never fail to make me smile!
This never gets old.

Bird pecking through your hair with a lil beak has to be like having your head stroked gently by someone with long nails
I think I melted a little the first time our green cheek did this. It's still fucking adorable!
I like how the birb fixes his feathers!
Anyone know if he‚Äôs single? The man, not the bird...asking for a friend.

Wow i really needed this pure content.
The bird has more senses and is genuine than A LOT of humans!
On loop.
His beard turned green as it happened.
He has another of the bird hiding in his hair. Soo cute and he has great hair!
I would be nibbling on him too. üòâ
I like, and I've had dogs, parakeets, especially cats, and even a fish that way.

What comes around goes around, be it love or hate.
damn quarantine.  this broke me way more than it should!
How do you get animals to like you instead of treating you as a food dispenser? I feel like I've tried everything...
Cant stop watching it
That's awesome!
This is a repost of a repost of a repost
My bird Milton used to do that, here lately he just bites me and it makes me sad because he was a really affectionate bird and then one day just stopped.
Who is this human and his precious liddo birdie???
This gave me a teary eyed smile. I could see his heart beat harder üòä
God I miss this. I had a bird I used to take out and play with every day. Eventually she started doing that cheek rub, but would start at one check, go down and under my chin and bring it back up the other cheek. It was hilarious. Never had another pet nearly as sweet and loving as that little quaker parrot.
What type of bird is it? I want one too
So adorable.  And the bird is cute, too :)
Birds are either gonna bite the hell out of you. Or be your best friend. No between.
What a sweet bird
Sweet
Is this Wayne from letterkenny?
My cat isn‚Äôt this sweet!
This will be buried, but holy shit... I cried a little
I kinda want a pet bird now too
Thanks, I needed that
I need 1
Love this guy, he has his show in Animal Planet.
That bird is incredible.
Don't know who is cuter
My cousin in Korea has a pet bird like this. I found it fascinating that it would just perch on her shoulder and she would just continue to work on her computer as if nothing was out of the ordinary lol. And when the bird was being too loud, she would scold it and it would somehow listen?!?!
I think that "realizes" may be the wrong word here (shoudn't he expect this)? but it is very cute nonetheless.
Birb
I love him back too!

He truly is a Disney Princess
Is this the same guy that pulled that cyst out of his upper lip with a pair of pliers?
Mmmm, elephant fresh!
I will never get sick of this video. Ever.
Ohmygoodness so f‚Äôing cute
I bet it tickles.
My cockatiel did that best feeling in the world
Awwwwwwww ‚ò∫
That is all the way awesome
I want a burn but I couldn‚Äôt keep something that could fly in captivity.
Man, this video makes me want to get a bird so bad, but I know I definitely don‚Äôt have enough free time to give it the attention it would need
Soo cute!!
That is just super awesome......
I love these two, look adorably cute.

Was that love or was the bird wiping his face after that lmao
Love his expression. 'couldn't believe he loves me so much '!
aw :')
Oh man! He about to cry
he could rip his eye with a good bite
How can you reach this level of trust with a bird? Mine gets crazy scary everytime I need to change his food
What kind of bird is this?
Such a proud bird dad

Omg the bird is grooming him, that is so wholesome.
This simply just raises my heart to the Heavens.
 Blessings, love and lightüôè
Just gotta say that's cute as fuck.
That bird will probably hate any woman he has around. Birds can be really territorial cause they choose you as a mate. Experience... I bought my mom an African Gray and he hated everyone but her.
This is so precious. Also wow the bird is so cute and so is the owner hahaha
Aww I had one. They love so much and need it back. They need paired

I had a bird like this. He was kinda mean. He would bite my ear and neck and once bit my lip when i tried to do something similar

He wasnt my bird he was my brothers and i only tried to play with him after my brother moved out and left him
That is SO cute! I'm melting
This makes my heart melt! I'm gonna save this to rewatch when I'm down and need a pick me up.
Damn that feels good
Awe. Good birb
 That made me tear up. So cute :)
No matter how many times I see this it always brings a smile to my face, what a sweet bird! ü¶ú
That make me remember my bird he died last year.
Im about to cry
The only thing I don't miss about having birds is constantly getting pooped on.

It's enough to make a grown man cry.
He be lovin‚Äô those hairs tho
Is anyone else scared of the image of the bird picking his eye?
Is this not the guys from saved by the barn ??
I love how wholesome that was
How do you make animals trust a person like this?

I dont know. Vet looked after him and all he gave was pain killers.. and he hated those and me a bit in the process. Tried everything i could think off changing food/ more vitamines / prote√Øne he does not respond to anything kinda lost in what to do, but ill keep trying/ looking for solutions. But when i saw this video it was a bit emotional its my friend. So all i can say is when u have this kinda friendship with a bird enjoy it!!!! And thanks all for your consern! <3

What the fuck kinda of reaction is that.
Sorry to burst some bubbles, but that's not love - the bird is just absorbing some of the natural skin's oil out of necessity. After all, even autonomous drones need to lubricate their gears and such.
Bah!
What if the bird was actually like, "Ewww gross, human cooties!" And was trying to rub it back on 'im.
