The dogs face is like when you ask your parents if you can have a friend over.
üé∂ Troy and Puppy in the morning üé∂
I like how the dog also smiles
dog: i didn't ask him to do it. neither did I bring this letter so we could hang out and have fun.
i'd like to think that that dog had met the kid and then delivered the message to the owner.
Awwww look at the dog, he's like asking for permission to play with the boy :)
The good news is, that in 2 years when this is over and. Trey is in fourth grade still, the dog will be bigger and need those walks.
'And more'....hold up there, Bundy.
He‚Äôs also point guard and has a basketball game tomorrow
I swear I've seen this post before
[deleted]
Anyone else think this letter was from the dog for a while? Lol
Yes, but also hell no..  my mom. Lost my dog after having it 3 hrs. 

Don't trust anyone but a professional or experienced dog owner to trust your best friend with
Doggo‚Äôs on board
This repost has already been suspected of being fake.  It's easily to tell it's photoshopped.

EDIT: Grammar is -> has
I‚Äôll probably get downvoted for this, but what‚Äôs up with Troy‚Äôs penmanship?

I‚Äôve worked at schools with grade school children and if that‚Äôs average for the current 4th grader, we‚Äôve really gone downhill.
Would not trust a kid with my dog...
4th grade and you write like that?
Not letting a 4th grader take care of a dog when they can't take care of themselves.
‚ÄúHi my name is trey i have a basketball game tomorroooooow‚Äù
Bad photoshopped repost
This but not a shameless repost without credit, that's what.
Troy should have better handwriting than that if he's in the fourth grade yo
Re post and its on the front page againüôÑ
[deleted]
Thats cool and all but i ain't trusting my dog with a 4th grader
Don't ever trust kids.
What would be more wholesome? How about not faking some lame as fuck bullshit for internet points?
Geeeetouttaheeeerewitchafakecraaaaap!
How to farm karma on reddit: 

1. Write on a piece of paper like a 4th grader some innocent cute message
2. Take picture of message and perfectly place your pet in the background
3. Post picture to reddit and claim that it is 100% real 
4. Watch your karma increase by 50k plus because gullible people on reddit that actually spend money on this platform will give you "awards"
The pup is @arthurthefloof on Instagram. His (his moms') posts bring so much joy to my day! ‚ù§
This is the cutest repost I‚Äôve ever seen
Damn children trying to steal our jobs.
"and more"

Wink
That‚Äôs kinda sucky 4th grade hand writing ngl. Not saying it‚Äôs fake but seems suspect.

And why would it be ripped? This kid isn‚Äôt in kindergarten he‚Äôs in 4th grade like idk man.
This might seem like a dumb question but I‚Äôll ask it anyway; why do American‚Äôs say kids grade in school rather than their age? I notice this all the time, it‚Äôll be ‚Äúmy fifth grader went to blah‚Äù or ‚Äúback in the first grade we did blah‚Äù
I wish Troy lived near us , we have 4 that always want a walk
My first ‚Äújob‚Äù was walking my neighbors white lab and I loved it
Ima do this for my neighbor, they have like 3 or 4 cats, I‚Äôve bacsically watched one of them who is a loud boi and like to sit on laps
Seeing this makes me so angry inside. Why can‚Äôt we work together to stop the spread
Points for initiative. 

Extra points for being sensible about the virus!
This is so sweet. I also would like to walk that pup.
I know something more wholesome. Not reposting
That lil doggo such a proud boy. Wait. Proud Boi.
I would deffinetely not trust my dog to a 4th grader. It sounds young, how old is a 4th grader?
I know that this is a generalization but...

Every child deserves a pet and every pet deserves a child
My ex and I‚Äôs neighbor‚Äôs son made up business cards for his dog walking business. It was so freaking cute.
Goddamn.

Reddit - the only place where a cute note from a thoughtful kid who loves his neighbor's dog can turn into a discussion about complex PTSD warnings...
... and more ..
Yeah see how he feels after he picks up a runny shit in a plastic bag
35 year old man‚Äôs resume.
Depends what Troy meant by ‚Äòand more‚Äô in his letter...
That moment when you get covid from a letter
Thank you Troy, very cool
Actually looks like the dog wrote the note and pretending Troy wrote it
You should insist on 10 years experience for an entry level position just like a real employer.
Your dog looks like he's a real good boy and you should definitely let him hang out with troy
kids got good grammar
Why does it look like the dog is in on it üòÇ
Im crazy but somehow the dog is aware of what the letter says.
And more!
üòçüêï
I would definitely let Troy walk my dog. That's a good kid, for sure.
Very cute!!! üòç‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
Troy is 37
Tear in the eye
Troy ROCKs!
we need more troys in the world
Looks like the dog is in on it... Precious
The dog looks so proud of himself. Freaking adorable.
this is my dog! follow him on instagram at @arthurthefloof
I mean you have to give him the job
Yo shout out to this young kid spelling Neighbors correctly.
You are totally hiring Troy right?
You have the most sweet and awesome neighbor.
This is the stupidest sub on the whole reddit because we're the only people to enjoy this kind of stuff and when we read about a kid who wants to sitting a dog our day changes magically in better
As a cat lover, this beats 90% of the cat.compilations
Why is the Nintendo Switch behind the TV?
Awe, I think OP is going to have to take troy with doggo on their walks occasionally
That's the sense of humor that most people admire.
Is the dog Troy?
How can you not say 'YES' to this?
That's really cute but no thanks. I ain't gonna trust some kid to look after my friendo.
Welp,  just cried...
r/untrustworthypoptarts
Dawwwwwwwwwwwww
I really feel for kids right now man. I never had to go through anything remotely close to this shit growing up in the 80's/90's. It was just Nintendo, WWF and Punky Brewster. Thats as complicated as it got.
Much hollesome
Very wholesome
Ima do this for my neighbor, they have like 3 or 4 cats, I‚Äôve bacsically watched one of them who is a loud boi and like to sit on laps
We all need to get our shit together now for Troy.  Wear a mask
I hope OP takes this kid up on the offer and let's Troy walk this pup!
I thought he had a basketball game tommorow?
I like this kids parents.  He‚Äôll be mad independent
Dog looks so proud like they made a friend
I can sense the toy or treat being used to get that doggo to sit still for this photo. üòÇ
Very patriotic apparently, red white and blue.
Wow, What a beautiful loving message for the Dog and owner. Are you sure that dog doesn't have a pen hiding somewhere.
his name is Troy and he has a basketball game tomorrow
I've seen this before, a while back...
Took me way to long to realize the dog didnt write the note
NGL, I thought Troy was the dog for a second.
That‚Äôs so cute, he thinks the COVID-19 lockdown will end one day!
He will be 10 years old when he first walks the dog.
Does the dog always look like he's feeling a nice cool breeze?
Why do I think this is fake? People will do alot for karma these days.
I‚Äôd watch this tv show
You better say yes
Troy will be in college by the time the pandemic is over.
He'll be graduating when this is over.
I know this dog!!!!
Did the dog write that note? He looks like he wrote that note.
This is so sweet and precious
Poor kid is bored and wants a friend.
Plot Twist: Actually the dog wrote this memo so he could roam alone in the park and have all day to sniff around.
This is wholesome 1000%.

However, a cautionary tale... when I was a kid, I think around 10yrs old, I went to a friend of my parents house as I knew they had 2 small white dogs (westies) and my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô and I wanted to walk the dogs. We offered to walk them, free of charge, and that we were planning to walk through the woods adjacent to a cow field.

The owners thought we were adorable for offering and let us walk their dogs. Half way through the walk my mate let one of the dogs off the lead - it bolted for the cow field (can you see where this is going). 10 minutes later a small brown dog came running back to us - the dog was covered in cow shit. It had found a cow pat and rolled all in it. 

My friend mysteriously announced she ‚Äúhad to go home now‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs your parents friend so you return the dogs‚Äù (I didn‚Äôt know it then but she was a massive bitch and used to gas light me all the frickin time). 

I turn up to the dog owners house with one pristine white westie and one smelly shit covered westie.
Plot twist: the pup wrote this note because he wants to hang out with Troy. Pup thinks you‚Äôre more likely to say yes if it‚Äôs Troys idea.
This is clearly and adults handwriting
 

Doggo‚Äôs on board

Very bad script for a 4th-grader! That kind dog-sitter must be sitting way to much on his computer keyboard! ;)
Inside puppy's mind *please say yes*
Dogdamnit this is cute
So did Troy get the job?
I think this is fake. For internet points.
Troy's gonna be in high school before this virus is done.
You can tell he tries to rip the paper out of his notepad and messed up. It‚Äôs so wholesome 4th grade student
I couldn't spell neighbor at that age. Impressive
The color change halfway through is wholesome af
Wow this is a very good pupper and very good human!
The dog sitting there like that makes this post x1000000 times better
Check yes or no

üî≥ yes

üî≥ no

üî≥ maybe
dog approves.
If you ask my mom she'll say yes, if I ask her she'll say no.
something that's not reposted?

Face masks and a little hand sanitizer on the dog leash can make this happen now!
Puppers is ready to go!
My first jobs were taking care of neighbor‚Äôs animals and plants and eventually their kids. I hope you can hire this kid and throw him some ice cream money once it‚Äôs safe to mingle again.
Hire that young man yesterday and give him a five dollar bonus for the hustle.
The puppy is waiting for mommy to let his friend come over!
Tell him you guys need a date night and give him 5 bucks. Also ask him to take pictures so you know the dog is ‚Äúokay.‚Äù It‚Äôll be the best $5 you ever spent. ‚ù§Ô∏è
And more
Walks and more* Even at 4th grade he is a Terms and Agreement master.
Let the boy dog sit
Dont let him eat your dog, when I was in 4th grade i have done mistakes.
Love that!
I am also willing to participate
Your dog looks like he is touched by the wholesomeness as well
wholeome
Its a trap
Literally nothing
Nice
I love how Troy bales on red and goes to blue
Someone‚Äôs single dad is plotting something..
Does he have a basketball game tomorrow?
You better let him walk the good boy after the virus
.... dang allergies
Is it raining?
Troy, if you lived in Texas (do you??), I would hire you!! ‚ù§
Aww so sweet!
The world needs more of this
Your baby looks so proud of himself
Hmm I wonder what happened to the red pen...
write a letter addressed to him with your response and put it in their mailbox
Such a cute letter! I would've loved to do this as a kid, sadly nobody in my neighborhood had a dog :(
This is @arthurthefloof on IG.
So sweet
*walks the dog* -> "Ok I charge 200$ an hour"

Oops wrong sub.
Do you really have such a bad handwriting in 4th grade? 

It looks like something someone in 2nd grade had written.
My daughters (4 y/o) stood outside our house during most of the pandemic and asked people who walked their dog to pet them. We just got them a dog. I feel this boy.
Did you say yes?
Dude that kids gonna try to gut your dog
First of all that is a good boy and the kid seems sweet too
I'll answer for you... Yes, the answer is yes
More of this energy in the world please <3
That‚Äôs so cute! Omg! My heart!
I would b wary. In my home country people say things 2 get ur livestock to feed they family. This is mostly likely fake =/
Puppers is so proud of neighbor üò≠
And more
Would be nervous to let a kid watch my dog... especially a kid I didn't even know.
Goddamnit, Troy. You‚Äôre hired.
We all know as soon as his family moving he gonna steal that cute ass dog
Jesus. My cold dead heart woke up for one second.
Good ole fluffer puppo
Aww this made my day!!! This is so awesome!!!
That feels like a 1, 2 punch of cute and good parenting.
I love the pride your dog shows for being wanted.
If troy was also a dog
That dog is in for a world of friendship with Troy.
I lived in a townhome complex and always had toys in my front yard for my son but all the neighborhood kids knew they were allowed to play with them as long as they put them back and didn‚Äôt break anything. Well when we got a bulldog blue heeled puppy kids would constantly come over to ask if my son and the puppy could come out and play. So up until the dog hit about 35-40lbs and was stronger than all the kids he got to run and play tag with all the kids a few times a day. I miss living there.
Perfect match really.
Your dog looks like he‚Äôs AFK, waiting for you to talk
I wonder if he‚Äôs got a basketball game tomorrow‚Ä¶
If he used green marker too
What can.

Puppy snuggle and kissesüòÑüòç
Probably the whole piece of paper.
Bro I have the same name
Oh my gosh, this is cutest thing I‚Äôve seen in a long time.  I love this little fellow and Troy.  I wish I could hire them both!!
YES!
PLEASE give him a job
Well this is just the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Doesn‚Äôt look like mom or dad saw this before they posted it either. Considering the quality. They may have gone out of their way to do this, which is extremely endearing.
Well did you say yes?
a new rendition of "a dog wrote my homework"
Well now, damn, that there is cute!
Saw this months ago, any updates on if he got to walk the doggo?
Back of the line Troy
I thought the dog was Troy :/
Kids like, "How can I play with this dog AND get paid".  I think he figured it out.
‚ÄòAnd more‚Äô ? What kind of place do you think this is!?
If there's a fence somewhere, I'd let them both play.  See who tires out whom first.
[removed]
Your dog is adorable. Not to destroy the kids plan but if he tries to charge you I will watch your dog for free.
If you say no, you have no soul.
I really want to think that the dog's name is Abed
I hope you said yes
Yes
This is like 3 months old
Big proud head on the dog üòÇ
"Everyday I'm hustling... ‚Äù
I bet he wrote this after he won his basketball game!
So you hired him right?
What would be more wholesome is if you didnt repost
PLOT TWIST : There is no Troy....never was....
I‚Äôve seen worse resumes from adults.
I'm a fan of that kid XD
I don't know why, but this made me cry
Is that an F1 golden doodle? Around 4 months? Maybe 3.5 months?
I would never trust some random 4th grader with my dog.
YOU BETTER HAVE SAID YES TO HIM!!
A fucking 4th grade wrote that? I believe that because my handwriting was worse
Hello everyone
Absolutely not unless supervised
Walks and what? Mo..
[deleted]
Not reposting it
this is a old post tho. ive seen this before
He if he wants food why doesn't he ask
Doggo approves
Who wouldn‚Äôt want to be Troy?
"walks and moe" sounds like fun.
I thought the dog was meant to be Troy until the end
I just awww so hard my eyes watered a little.
Bbehgdhxbxhxbbxhxh I‚Äôm dying form cuteness
Not sure how wholesome the 'and more...' part is!
Kid‚Äôs angling for some time with your dog. Smart. Too smart...
Man, that is so fucking sweet. He loves doggo that much, he wants to spend time with him or her
Same, Troy. Same
This is so wholesome.
I'm in my thirties, and have thought about asking my neighbor the same thing.
And the dogs all let him take me for a walk a guy can't have too many walks you know go on what can it hurt I promise to be good .
[What a ridiculous name for a cat.
This brightened my day.
This is so cool!
:)
No entendi
Your pup is about to make a friend for life.
That dog is in the 4th grade? 2020 is crazy.
What is the last word?
R/wholesome
Doggo is like "I made a new fren" so cute. Hope you said yes! I have a younger sister who love taking my doggo out, I went with her for the first few times but now she loves taking him out on her own :)
Absolutely awesome!!
I meant to say, pawsome!
https://youtu.be/_AVSSaOgmX0
Fake.
Fake. There‚Äôs no backward e.
may be stupid, but what breed of dog is featured in the photo?
His mom helped him spell the word neighbor I bet.
how the fuck did a dog write this?
I‚Äôll take, things that never happened for 400 Alex.
He still has better handwriting then me
Me me me too!! üòÄ
That kid has better penmanship than I do
Thats just so adorable
Who wouldn't wanna go on walkie with that cute bun?
üò≠ my heart
It's aww but I wouldn't let a little kid dog sit in any circumstance.
Ugh.
I vote yesüëç
There‚Äôs a horse you can have in meantime, we will leave it outside your gate tonight, enjoy Troy.
4th grader sure writes like a 1st grader... interesting...
Man I read that entire thing assuming it was written "by" the dog!!! Lol! Like the neighbours attached the note to the dog haha
Omg look at that flooper with the snoops and boops fluffs.
Hello neighbor, my name is trey and I have a basketball game tomorrow
What a nice neighbor
Children are the future
Plot twist, they replied: "No get your on dog you little fucker"
‚ÄúAfter the virus‚Äù

Giorno: ‚Äúyeah...‚Äù
My heart. This is so sweet
Why does this blow up every tome it gets reposted?
What breed is that?
And more
She‚Äôs hired!
Check if the child's family had a dog named kolby.
I'm fairly certain Troy graduated from college by now.
So cute
That is a really cute puppy.
I love the job they did taking the page out.
I like to think Troy is the dog, and they're referring to a different dog
I'm sorry but I must do this...

"Hi my Trey and I have a basket ball game Tomorrow, I'm on point guard-"

(in all seriousness though that's the most wholesome thing I've seen come out of a 4th grader.
I'm pretty sure I've seen something just like this before, minus the virus reference.
what breed is that pup?
and more...
YOU‚ÄôRE HIRED
It‚Äôs a trap.
I wouldn't trust a kid in the 4th grade who can't even take care of a piece of paper to take care of my dog.
This is so wholesome!
The dog delivered it right?


Right??
Sweetest thing ever
This is awesome! I hope you take this kid up on his offer
"and more"
That letter plus the dog's expression 100% has the feel of two little kids asking their parents if they can have a sleepover.  Even the most wild little kids will get business-like when it comes to proposing a sleepover and this is what that is, except with a dog.  Too adorable.
Love how the dog is up at attention as its being read.
I could never bring myself to let someone else walk my dog. If anything happened I would never forgive myself.
As a Troy not knowing almost any others, this Troy gives me hope.
Literally nothing!! Obsessed with this!
Does he have a basketball game tomorrow
I love that this is thehighlight of my day
Totally üëå
That's so sweet and kind of him to offer to walk the doggo!
Aww how cute. Id buy a dog just to help out this kid to let him walk it.
The dog reminds me of Nathan from South Park
Is that a golden retriever
Aww let this happen
Hello u/sugar_boom my name is u/jdthetransient I am 30 years old and I'm just wondering if maybe after this virus you need a dogsitter and if so i can take your dog on walks and more
That is so cute, both the letter and the pup
Look at that proud pupper omg
You better agree
Um can I have Troy???
Awww what a sweet baby
This kid is too wholesome
Fuck, man. I would pay for a dog walker.
Fuck, man. I would pay for a dog walker.
Its cute till you find out he's 32.
From an old guy perspective, I love it
Wtf no joke like actually that‚Äôs my cousins note bruhhhhhhhhh
I‚Äôm not joking that‚Äôs my cousins note Troy is my cousin and I saw this before when my mom showed me she said it was my cousin and it‚Äôs surprising seeing it here bruhhhhhhhhh
Give the kid a job.
That just made me cry for some reasonüò¢
get him signed up
Omg I just got teary eyed...so sweet
Who else hear trying to get karma üòÇ
Plot twist, Troy is 40.
I remember seeing this a few months ago. Would love an update from Troy.
u/Panthersfan1990
Can't help but think the kid would very much like to have a dog of his own.
I‚Äôd like to believe the dog somehow wrote that
Jesus u guys are gullible
So wholesome!
....and more
And more.
Our neighborhood Troy wasn‚Äôt this wholesome.
Pls give the kid the gig. That‚Äôs really sweet and your dog is also saying ‚Äúpweeze‚Äù
It‚Äôs nice to know after his basketball games he walks dogs.
I used to take my friends, mom's, boyfriend's dog for walks when I was a kid. I wanted a dog so bad, and loved having a happy companion to go on walks with me.
Awww-
Awwww when I was his age I did the same with my neighbor who had a Pomeranian. I wanted to walk that dog so bad!!! Some of my favorite times ever was walking my neighbors dog in exchange for treats :) lovely share
That's heartwarming.
Wonderfully wholesome. What a breath of fresh air! I so needed to see this today!!
The tape lol.
is Troy a common name these days?
It‚Äôs cute and all, but I totally wouldn‚Äôt let a 4th grader walk my puppy. That‚Äôs just asking for an accident.
And more
I‚Äôd invite the lil guy over for hot chocolate he seems so precious
Too precious.
i wouldnt be giving your dog back
The dog in the background be like ü•∫
For the record, there is very little risk of contracting covid human to dog, and then again dog to human.  So long as you treat the dog as a surface, this is possible now.

However, asking a fourth grader to not pet that dog is a tall order.
We gonna need to se a picture of Troy and the puppet together OP
I remember when I was younger, like 10-12 years old I would take people‚Äôs dogs on walks. I charged 2 dollars, but if they couldn‚Äôt pay I‚Äôd do it anyway. We‚Äôd play with them, bring them to the park, nice long walks around my area. I‚Äôd only take one dog at a time, so I‚Äôd spend my entire day outside. I was never much of a dog person but knew sometimes people were busy and couldn‚Äôt always walk their dogs as much as they wanted. It was a blast.
Get those 2 on a play date right now! When our golden was a puppy he loved my husband and I best, and adored wrestling other dogs, but his favorite playmate was any little boys. Something about little boys wrestling with puppies is just special! Maybe you can work a deal with the mom to have the little guy scoop pop and play a couple times a week?? Awesome neighbors you have and I am jealous of your puppy!
‚ÄúAnd MORE!‚Äù
Didn‚Äôt happen.
That letter was written by a 35 year old
Kid has the penmanship of a 3rd grader at best
Your dog is giving you that look that kids make while their friends are asking their parents if they can stay the night.

EDIT I made this comment before scrolling down to realize it‚Äôs already the top comment but I‚Äôm too ashamed to delete it
I would also like to ‚ÄúDog sit‚Äù this little one
What kind of dog is that?
Employ this upstanding young one.
This image is precious...
Cute but I wouldn‚Äôt give the privilege of walking my dog to the neighbours kid, over my dead body!
Awwww 
I don't have a dog, a cat, not even a goldfish all I have is little pestering Ants. 
Your Hired Kid üíóüíó
You better let Troy walk your dog
A fourth grader who's a go getter? 
Application accepted! 

P.S That puppy looks awful suspect. Probably helped write that noteüòÜ
He‚Äôs hired, right? Right??üíú
Kid is going places
*clenching chest* ow my heart cant handle the wholesomeness.
Poor kid probably doesn‚Äôt realize he‚Äôll be in 5th or 6th grade before the pandemic is over
.
Did the dog write the letter for the kid haha that face looks like it
This kid is super cool. I like his go to it-ness.
I hope there are a great deal more of young men like Mr. Troy.
Hold up. I‚Äôve seen this post before.
IS that the handwriting of a 4th grader in the US? 

That is really shocking!
Hmm
Plot twist: Troy is a 37 year old man
"on walks and more..."
Awwwwwe
Was anyone else expecting a dog shame for fucking up the drywall?
I saw this picture months ago, i was hoping this was a follow up post. That pup needs a sitter!
Wholesome 100 reddit moment
Keanu chungus
He just wants to get close to you to play the switch lol
Wholesome! üò≠üò≠
No interview is needed, if you don‚Äôt hire him you‚Äôll lose the best dog sitter in the world
Curious as to why he has to wait till virus is over. It cant pass from animal to human.
Gotta love the tape job across the hello. Kid was so excited to deliver the note he ripped into it!
Aw that is just too cute. Kid probably wants a dog and saw yours and... well who wouldn't want to hang out with that cool dude?
Hello neighbors. My name is Troy and I have a basketball game tomorrorrow
A young entrepreneur is always respectable. Also puppy!
Puppers just got asked out on his first date
Lol
I read this in the voice of [Tre](https://youtu.be/j5bRtIfPlyA) who famously had a basketball game tomorrow.
I also want to help walk this dog.
Oh my gosshhhhhhhh. Precious!!!
Why is it all these "kid" notes on reddit are written left handed? Look at the D's. Also, the other letters.
pretty please!!!!!
That dog has tremendous hand writing.
The puppy is so cute though!!!
This looks familiar
I feel like I've seen this before.
R/nothingeverhappens me all you want but i feel like this is bullshit.

https://i.imgur.com/HBZHiqV.jpg
You said no, right?
So sweet
Awwwwhhhhh!!!
I'm curious to know about, "walks and more"
Let him walk dog even during virus.  It‚Äôs possible to remain clean
I don‚Äôt think Troy can tomorrow though, I hear hey has a basketball game
Hi, it‚Äôs me Troy
Yes
What a Chad
That's so cute.
What dog breed is that
Oh my God this 4th graders handwriting is better than mine.
Omg please hire him!!!!!!
Nobody going to call out that this is obviously selfmade?
"No, learn how to write before I entrust a life to you, I wouldn't let you borrow a pen let alone a crayola marker."
It looks like that puppy is vouching for the boy
I'll fight that Troy kid to hang out with the dog.
That's adorable.
dogs face says it all
It's just a kid that wants to play with your dog? Fucken happens all the time.
Too bad Troy didn't leave a phone number!

*tosses note*
"He loved your note so much, he ate it."
So can I dog sit for you?
I, too, would like to walk your dog.
I love how he offers to mop.
Awwwwwwww
Damn smooth operator
Look at that pose!!!
i don‚Äôt know why but i thought troy was the puppy and he is in 4th grade good boy troy
read it as ‚Äúdog sister‚Äù and i‚Äôm like tf.......
That dog is desperate for you to say YES!!
This is very wholesome. But can‚Äôt help but notice his writing. Don‚Äôt they teach kids to write straight and properly in school nowadays. I‚Äôm honestly asking because I know in some schools it‚Äôs laptops and iPads as notebooks. Does the use of these devices start at an early age now?
Skrew covid. Let the boi and the pupper play
If you're considering you might want to know Troy better. Personally I'm not trusting anyone with my BBF.
I love this because it reminds me of my childhood. Growing up I lived near an awesome dog named Bailey, and her owners told me I could play with her whenever I wanted. I would head over on a snowy morning, bundled in my snow gear and ask if Bailey could come out and play. We would play all day in the snow. She would hang out with me in the snow forts I made and eat the snowballs I threw. Such a great memory - I hope this child makes the same!
One of my friends has only cats and thinks my dogs are great so I let her walk them once and within a minute she had been knocked over by them haha
Herlihy boy pet sitting service. For the love of all that is holy, let the boy walk your dog.
Up until the dogsitter part, I thought it was one of those posts where the dog ‚Äúwrote‚Äù the letter
Did troy get to hang out with the dog? I hope he did üòä
that face is proud and beautiful. he's in on this plan!
This is also the 4th or 5th time this has been reposted 
Can someone do the repost bot thing? I do not know how
Get this kid a Puppy!!
This is so pure! Plus the little puppy face, I can‚Äôt!
This is my friend‚Äôs dog. @arthurthefloof on Instagram. I‚Äôve met him, and he is the CUTEST.
My man is writing letters like the zombies in PVZ
What a nice kid!
Only the innocence of a child could be stupid enough to think this Hell ever ends.
I would love to walk my neighbour's dog too but I'm 36
The cuteness of children.
Nice font.
Ahhhh man this feels good
Cute little entrepreneur
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Plot twist, its a 37 year old man.
Suspicious post
I would be scared ü§°
It was meh until I looked right.
It‚Äôs a trap.
Eat The Dog Jeff!
And more lololol
That would absolutely make my day! They need to be friends right now lol!
Entrepreneur...
he can‚Äôt tomorrow though because he has a basketball game
Well, if Troy has no animal at his house I sure hope his neighbors are kind enough to let him play with their dog sometimes.
I would give that dog my cake
I let my neighbor take my puppy out it play all the time, they absolutely love eachother. Granted my neighbor is like ten lol. Also it's usually a gaggle of girls coming over to play, haha.
The doggo helped.  Either he ripped the page out for the kid to write it or the kid was so excited because it was so important and urgent he didn't mind that the paper was all torn up.  Or he delivered the page to the doggo and the doggo chewed it with urgent delivery.
Someone speed up this damn virus there's a dog needing petsitting
Hire him when this is over
So sweet. They could safely let him play with the puppy ‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww! This melted my heart even though the letter wasn‚Äôt for me. Kids are the cutest.
Did Troy get the job?
4th grade and still writes like a 7 year old, id be wary of leaving my dog with that kid
He secretly wants to fuck the dogs
I like reading this in one long, excited, exasperated, run on sentenced in what i think 4th grade troy sounds like.
Hi my name‚Äôs troy; i‚Äôm a point guard
I have a basketball game tomorrow
ending with what appears to be, "I can Take your dog on walks and more" seems a little sketchy..
On the next episode of unsolved mysteries... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Please let them be friends!
I hate to be skeptical, but this is seems kinda fake. Why would a kid randomly point out what grade they're in on paper? It's like it there to be cuter.
Awwww! ‚ù§
