Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony
OMG you 2, get a doghouse
They look like an adorable old couple who finally got to move to their dream retirement home.
When is the wedding? 
Would this be considered an interracial couple?
Nice picture. May I ask where? It looks so similar to a place I lived in AK.
Where is this?
Wish my boyfriend would hold me like that 
Wow this is amazing 
How does one get two dogs to hug each other like this? I'm lucky to get mine to sit.
For fork sake. I wanna hug them so bad. 
Looks like an ad for engagement rings.
Oh good lord that is adorable..
Fine I'll take one picture... ONE...but I'm not smiling
Dogs in the age of Instagram 
Why can‚Äôt the Daily Mail write more stories about couple dogs
What a beautiful picture. Literally smile when I first saw it and it made my day. Thank you
‚ÄúWoof, twoo woof, wiw fowwow you fowevuh...‚Äù
It makes me feel sad and happy at the same time.
This must be right after one of them proposed, right? (Great spot!) Have an awesome honeymoon, you two! :)
It's a nice day for a dog wedding
I don't understand why my hooman wants me to do this ? Let's just make him happy .

My favorite part is the white glow around the dogs.

Cutest thing seen so far today. Nice.
Is that Heart Lake in New York?
I actually Awwed out loud for the first time in my life.
Better love story than Twilight.
What lake, where is this? 
How long have you two been together Ms?
Good emotions shown by dog for photography looks natural
I had two Swedish Sheppards, Sasha/Hanns, if they were apart for any length of time they were miserable to the point of throwing up.  Sasha ruled and Hanns just followed along. 
Do you mind if I save this picture to my phone? I have this "good feels" album going, and this picture gives me all the good feels
This is my dream. 
This pic is absolutely beautiful! They look perfect together..

Is that lake placid?
Beautiful shot, what did you use to take it? I have a Nikon D3300 with the stock lens and an iPhone X at the moment. Love how the dogs appear to glow in the shot
Is this Sullivan lake??? 
Oh, my heart!  My favorite breed ‚ù§Ô∏è
I am SO hungover, Melanie. 

I know, babe, just look up for Gran. 
The white dogs face expression is just like "fuck this I'm cold I wanna go home".
He always said he wanted his ashes scattered on Brokebark Mountain.
such a cute couple.
Oh, dear brother. Rise, if you would. For that is our curse.
Is this okanagan lake ? 
I had both a Great Pyrenees and Golden Retriever growing up. They were the best of friends and two Thanksgivings ago we had to put down our Golden just two years after our Pyrenees. This picture is the essence of our two girls
"Hold me"    
"Ok."
On Facebook that couple would be like
"Lol some stranger happened to take our picture when we weren't looking."
#TotallySpontaneous
This makes me so happy
Next photo=humping
HOW CAN THIS BE REAL. WE DONT DESERVE DOGS
they two are adorable
I have picture of my grandparents doing a similar pose by a lake about 70 years ago
Cute 
Every kiss begins with Canine 
The most beautiful thing I've ever seen

/r/animalsbeingbros 
You cant tell from the picture, but white doggie is going in for a hump sesh
What a beautiful photograph.
This couple have better love life than me..
awe-inspiring & adorable
The things that make your cry when you've been on the opposite side of a continent completely alone  for two month and haven't seen friends or family and missing everyone on Thanksgiving your favorite holiday and all you want in the whole wide world is a head boop from your cat....
If my love life could be half as romantic...
Wait...I don't have one
Is this a common behavior for this breed or are we subscribed to the same Instagram page?
The perfect engagement photo.
tranquility, serenity and love  in a perfect setting.
This is what heaven looks like
Ngl your dogs are gorgeous 
This is my new wallpaper. X
White guy looks unhappy. I have a feeling someone was yelling "STAY!" at him to get this photo lol...
Ok best picture today!
Someone should shop Jon Travolta in this shot
Come live wi5 me and my wife
I feel lonely after seeing this. I love the background though.
When I grow up I want to be as content as these puppers.
Absolutely a beautiful shot!!!!!
That‚Äôs the beautiful pic!
I'll never let go Jack
Blacked!
Looks like a canine Viagra commerical
How‚Äòs the lake called?
We're wondering where this is, OP! I'm throwing in somewhere in Ontario, Canada as my guess. Lovely doggies <3
I bet OP just giddy with the prospect of all the sweet sweet karma he knew was inbound after snapping this pic.
Best picture on Reddit.
u/discipleofoden us
Dogs are the better humans, that's for sure.
I hope this isn't one of those 'the photographer actually killed them so he could pose the body to get those Internet points' photos.
Next pic would be the white doggie mounting the black doggie.
GGGAAAYYY!!!!!
