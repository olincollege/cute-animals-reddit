Hank is a great name for a cat, he actually looks like a hank
He’s handsome!  I’ve had my FIV+ pussface for about 15 now and while getting frail, she’s a doll!
Hank is tired of absolutely everyone’s shit. What a magnificent boy!
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus. 

Had to look that one up. 👍 
When my future wife and I ~~get~~ got an apartment it was a bit outside the city to save on rent. Driving home one afternoon a farm had a Free kittens sign. I pulled in and there were 2 litters of kittens. I played with them for about an hour and one kitten stood out from all the rest. Our dream was going to Maui so that was her name. She was one of the best cats I've ever had. She loved Faygo bottle caps and would play catch with them for hours if you let her. She was also huge, like 22lbs. Our kids grew up with her and a stray we picked up along the way. She died at about 16.  
Love them a lot while you have them.
30 years ago I also spent $10 on a cat I named Hankk ( 2 K's, that's how he wanted it spelled). He was a loving little jerk that hated to be held but demanded your lap as soon as you were still.  He would bite you for no reason and I adored him . He lived to be 19. I hope your magnificent prick has at least that many years ahead of him. He is perfect. 
Hank has seen it all, and knocked most of it off the counter.
What is caring for a cat with FIV like? Do you have to have a one cat household? How often does he need to visit the vet as opposed to non-FIV cats? 
People buy cats? Mine just showed up at my apartment when I was going to get groceries and let herself in.
Hank don't have 54 shits to give.  What a handsome boy with that smug face.  I can imagine him saying "I told you I only sale Propane and Propane Accessories" lol
He reminds me of Ron Perlman
A ten dollar magnificent prick... You couldn't ask for a better bargain!
He looks like an asshole.....I love him
Hank looks like he knows how much you paid for him and he isn't happy about that, you cheap bastard. 
I just spent $14 rescuing an FIV positive, 8 year old tuxedo cat. He has a snipped ear from being feral. His name is A and he’s a lovely chonker. 
For being FIV positive he sure has a negative looking face.
My neighbor put up a huge sign that said “free cat” and I thought maybe since they don’t speak English to well they forgot the “s” in cats. Nope. One cat lol probably 4 or 5 months old. The mom was all black and she was a tabby, and now 4 years later she’ll still my best friend.
Hey Hank! Ya' old prick!!!
Everything--and I mean *everything*-- about Hanks look says,  "F*** you, man." In a good way. (Maybe.)
Is FIV something you have to treat?
Well of course a cat would be too expensive as a college student. On top of supplying them with cat food, you'd have to pay their tuition.
I feel like adopting an animal with an immune disease is not a good strategy to keep costs down. But I’m glad you gave Hank a home and he’s been loved. 
No such thing as a "cheap" cat. It seems like OP had good intentions (and based on OP's comments, they're did/are doing the right thing in this case) but shelters sell older animals for less because they know you'll probably be hit with vet bills pretty soon. My $60 senior cat turned into a $2000 within just a couple months.
Hank you asshole, I love you!
Clearly, Hank had seen things. He might tell you about it over a whiskey.
Omg I love him so much 
That's a good looking Hank! I named [my black and white Hank](https://i.redd.it/515wfmvbxed21.jpg), too
He looks like he has had enough of your shit. 


“Can’t a cat have some goddamn privacy in this god forsaken house?!”
He looks like a Hank.
Please don’t tell me that he lives outside...
Not to be that guy but that sounds like it would cost you money down the line. That’s if you care to take your animals to the vet
I guess you could say it's been a positive experience
...broke college student but adopts a cat with a pre-existing medical condition that may require supportive care... not sure I aggree with the logic here 
My kitty is FIV+ as well. As far as we know the other two haven’t gotten it from him. We think he was born with it from him mother because we found him as a very friendly stray cat who was tops 4 or 5 months old. He’s never been sick a day in his life and will probably live just as long and fruitful a life as his brothers. 

His name is Loki!

Hopefully, you can be an ambassador for FIV-positive cats.  Spread the word that these cats usually live long, normal lives!  Too often they're euthanized just because of the retrovirus.

&#x200B;

I have 3 of them myself.
Is FIV the cat equivalent to HIV?
Hi old jerk man! I love you! 
I would buy propane and propane accessories from this cat.
I adopted a 1 year old abused Husky dog when he was the most scared I've ever seen an animal be. When I went to the SPCA to see him for the first time, he was so frightened, then lowered his ears and he came right up to the cage and licked my nose through the fence. I fell in love with this dog, Adonis. He had a broken tail. He was being raised as a show dog but got abused by his previous owners. I paid $80 for him. He brought me the best 15 years of my life. He had the happiest face all the time, was treated like a king, loved hiking, being spoiled with little plush toys, rawhides, etc.

He was with me through a marriage, losing my left hip due to degeneration, 5 different homes, and he always was by my chest when I went to sleep. I lost him this past November. 

Cherish Hank, spoil that dude. Looks like a special  kitty. You got a deal on your friend just like I did. :)

Edit: Holy crap... Thank you for the Silver! 
What a cutie pie!

OP: I know you mean well but I just want to clear up a misconception a lot of people have on reddit.  The money you paid is called adoption fee.  It is not the cost of the cat.  And might I say that's indeed a very low adoption fee.  When we adopted our two boys, the fee was $100.

If you are to broke to afford an animal, you shouldn't have an animal.
Man, getting time to unsubscribe from r/aww... starting to become r/pics with these damn titles giving life stories about things when people just want to look at animals.
Hank: I like you to, you little shit, now where's my bowl.
Hank is a perfect name for a beautiful prick like that.
My cat was almost 12 when I adopted her. She was free because she's a senior cat. I love her so much.
Super proud of you from getting him from a Kill Shelter. World needs more pet owners like you. :')
Got that Ron pearlmen look goin
Looks like a grumpy redneck grandpa sitting on the porch with a spit cup and a 12 gauge. Pet me or get off my porch!

&#x200B;
TIL people pay for cats.   
Thank you for adopting FIV+ cats!
Thank you and be blessed for taking the older cat to care for him. This cat is a gentleman. Thank you for that again! Maybe these are his last years, make sure to make them memorable and comfortable for him. Thank you again
What up, Hank!!????
FIV?
Hank looks so bored.... I love it.
Hank looks like gives zero fucks. He's perfect.
Hank’s plan to overthrow the world is days away from fruition! Stay on the good side of that magnificent Bastard.
Adopting a cat is only 40-60$ and that includes check ups for the first year, all shots and surgeries included... 
You know you'll need to be able to provide for any medical care he needs, right...? 
Hank looks like a smug bastard who would sell your kidney for a can of tuna, but deep down he would use his special set of skills to protect his loved ones.
"Take the fuckin' picture already" 

-Hank
You should know that this post is making the rounds in the animal welfare community. It’s the perfect illustration of why low-cost/free adoptions are good things. So many of us are grateful you shared it and that it’s gotten so much attention.
that’s the face of Fuck your $10.I am going to live forever and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in food and litter
Love the squint. Zero fucks given face. If he had a voice it'd be Wilem Dafoe. I'd still pester him unmercifully to let me pet him.
I feel like if you can't afford to get a cat you probably shouldn't get w cat with a disability/disease that will require more vet care than a healthy cat
my dog had to have surgery and stay hospitalized for two weeks.

best $3500 I ever spent.
DON’T 👏 GET 👏 A 👏 PET 👏 IF 👏YOU 👏CAN’T 👏AFFORD 👏THE 👏GOD 👏DAMN👏 VET 👏BILLS 😒
What a ridiculous name for a cat. [Hank](https://youtu.be/12aoJyPim6k) is a persons name.
Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a lentivirus that affects cats worldwide. From 2.5% up to 4.4%[1][2] of cats worldwide are infected with FIV. FIV differs taxonomically from two other feline retroviruses, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline foamy virus(FFV), and is more closely related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
Lol he looks like such an ass

Cats are awesome. We do not deserve their love
I love you Hank. 
He's like, 'TF you lookin at..' lol 
I love his grumpy face.
He LOOKS like a Hank
NVM, saw from other comments who asked the same thing.
Frequently you can get cats and dogs for real cheap at the city run kill shelters. Any time they get full, the adoption fees are slashed. The no kill, non-profits always need money and their fees can be in the hundreds. 
That smug look is worth the $10 alone
That look on his face already tells he's an ass hahahaha
Hank's a Tank.
He looks like a bastard. Can I have him?
Hank is an excellent name...if I do say so myself. 
Hank looks like he’s sick of everyone’s shit 
Those cheap ones usually are the best.
I’ve held on to my last coins to give to a simply amazing post ..... have my last silver OP.....
He looks like he’s about to break into a story about the shit in his past.
What is FIV? I assume it’s HIV but for cats?
He looks so annoyed. I love him. He speaks to me. 
why did you call him a bastard?!
Our cats are also HIV positive. Rocky was abused and beat with a hammer before we rescued him so his face is a little wonky looking, and Tiny Tim has stunted growth so he’s about 4 years old and the size of like a teenage cat (not quite a full cat not quite a kitten). These cats have the most personality out of any cat I’ve ever met. 
His face is grizzled from all those years of putting up with your dumbass. 10/10 would get a $10 cat
What is FIV? 
That face 100% says ["Shut up baby I know it"](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/75/3a/12/753a12d20a77ee3928aada3fed3c6110.jpg)
He really looks like a hank
Definitely a Hank.
He seriously looks like a Hank.  Perfect.
Definitely got a 'tude face :) hug him for me🤗
 
Magnificent, indeed.
I'm glad you took in an FIV positive cat. All to often they are simply put down because they are difficult to home. Good on you.
His face seems like he’s saying, “You don’t own me, peasant!”
damn hank looks like a boss
If you name a cat Hank, you are a good cat owner. Period. 
He looks like he starts his day with a stiff drink.
He looks like a cartoon villain.
I got an fiv homeboy too! The boi is the best!  I call him Stanky, stankbutt, and turkey boy! 
His name is Omie!
I had a cat with FIV.  He was a great cat, though he kept getting infections and cost me a fortune in vet bills and antibiotics.  There were never any major medical bills, but a lot of minor ones.
QUICK someone photoshop a cigarette and pinstripe suit on this good boy!
He's the best looking Hank I've ever seen and I don't even like cats.
Sometimes you just get lucky. 
                
They waived the kitten adoption fee for my cat Noodle cause she was super wonky and slid around more than walked. I had to sign a waiver of acknowledgement of her disability and how they weren't liable for potential expenses.
          
Jokes one them, she pretty much got all better and now just walks like a sassy lil princess and falls off the windowsill sometimes. Only thing extra she cost me was some furniture and window treatment damage cause prefered climbing to jumping for about a year. Love my clearance rack kitties!
You are awesome. Strays are the best.
My parents had a tuxedo cat with FIV named Hank! They now have another cat with FIV named Gunther and his hobbies include yelling at 2 am and shoving things off of surfaces.
My sweet girl is part of our local SPCA’s “golden paws” program bc she’s a senior. We picked her up for $5 and on our way out they said “we are running a buy one get one if you’d like someone else, too” and that’s how it should be man. Get these babies homes. 
Sorry if this isn’t posted elsewhere - I scanned quite a bit and didn’t see anything. I think it’s wonderful of you to adopt a kitty with health problems and I wish you many years of happiness together! The picture posted appears like the cat is out on a porch and I wanted to say it’s really important you don’t let him wander freely outside since FIV is very contagious through saliva. Sadly it puts all other cats in your area at risk. I’ve lost a few beloved cats in my lifetime - they were old-timer in-and-out cats known to our whole neighborhood, and they wound up contracting FIV in their later years :-(
As a Vet Tech, thank you for adopting this baby. 
To avoid possible transmission of FIV to neighborhood cats, shouldn’t you keep your cat indoors?
My best friend just had her cat diagnosed with FIV and we were under the impression he only had a couple weeks left. Could you tell me a little bit more about what it’s like living with this condition? Maybe it’s not as life threatening as we imagined? 
Thank you for adopting Hank despite his illness! I have an FIV+ cat, too, and tbh I forget he even has it most of the time because he is totally healthy. He gets along beautifully with our FIV- kitty, too. We named him Freddie after Freddie Mercury because of his diagnosis lol
Hank is beautiful,  majestic,  and has the perfect grumphaluphagus face.  Give scritches between the ears and under the chin for me. 
I’ll give you 1 million for Hank
I also have a tuxedo cat.
He looks like a prick thats what make him so great. He looks like he has the attitude I don't a flying #uck if you love me or not I am a cat and thats the way it is.
Hank looks like a cross between, "I haven't got long, so I have no fucks to give," and "God damn it I'm old as shit and tired of being alive."
He looks like he is king of them all. I love that look he's throwing out!
He’s scowling at me
This is the finest tribute I've ever read.
I love the resting bitch face! Haha cats are great
Greetings Hank
He looks like that evil villain in all the video games, the one who sits behind the desk and just stares out the window menacingly at the city that is his.
He looks like he'd take a piss on your laundry, shred your curtains, attack your dog, and make a mess of your house plants.  

All on the first day. 
Wow, he ACTUALLY looks like a “Hank” lol. 
He looks so done with your shit, OP
Wait, what's FIV? 
Sounds like an STD. 
My kitty has FIV and I got him for free at a shelter!!! He’s the best ever 💕
He looks like he just ran out of cigarettes and is pissed. 
Walk-in out of a grocery store , kid with a basket of kittens says hey wanna buy a kitty? 10 bucks . Search pockets, have $3 . Say , how about 3? Boom. Had a friend for 13 years.

My girl had been in a cage at the county shelter for almost 2 years, and they were giving her away for only the $12 licensing fee. She is the absolute sweetest creature I’ve ever known. 
Hi, Hank. 
Hank is tired of everyone’s bullshit. 
I have an FIV+ boy and he is the sweetest little man ever.
Awwww what a handsome boy. He deserves some good head pats. 
Hahaha he looks cranky but I’m sure that doesn’t mean he does not love you back. 
Adding to my comment. I didn’t know you can have FIV+ kitties with kitties who don’t have it! Super cool to know! Again thanks for giving him a home. He’s living a wonderful loving life!
He looks like he has character!
Awww my cat has FIV too and it is the sweetest baby ever!
Hank, you magnifigent bastard, I love you and don't even know you.
You can buy cats?? 
Just wanted to say this made my day when I was having less than a great day!
Who BUYS cats?
Lol, that dude looks like he's so tired of your shit:) Love it!
How you doing Hank?

Hank: sick and tired of being sick and tired
Yup. He looks like a Hank. Does he sell propane?
He has too much hair to be infected with the Forced Ivolutionary Virus, but i bow to our new feline Overlord just in case.
One of my cats was $75 and I got to say, I was broke as shit back then, but I’m glad I spent the money on him. He turns 4 this April and I’ve had him since he was 5 months. Worth every penny. 
Hank looks fed up with your bullshit. 
He loves and trusts you.  That's why slitty-eye <3
Well, fuck. I love Hank. 
He damn sure looks grouchy.
His face i love it omg
His face says he has no time for this nonsense.

My kind of cat!
My magnificent prick is also named hank :) , have many great moments with your lil asshole. 
Wow he even looks like an asshole. I love him. 
He looks like he hates you. so cute
*Hank knows what he did*
It want to up vote this everyday for the next ten years. 
 I fuckin love this cat 
He looks like a Hank.
Hank be like "haHaAAaaaa , fuck y'all hating ass simps, who's meow'n out now'
I still miss my asshole tux. He was a total jerk, but he was MY jerk. He was only ever sweet to me and my boyfriend ( which showed me that he was a keeper )
For a minute thought your cat was from the fallout universe, was going to mutate and leave you irradiated cat meat, 2 caps and steel after its demise.  
He looks like a tough old grizzled bastard. 
My guy is called Hank, too! He turns 12 in a couple of months. I actually got him for free because some sucker abandoned him by the side of the road. 

Hank cats are the best cats.
My brother just had to put down his 9 month old cat with FIV... some cats are lucky!  Congrats!
I got my FIV+ cat for free from a shelter - they said he’d be hard to adopt out! I got him because my first FIV+ was lonely. The first guy was abandoned because he had a bad upper respiratory infection and really bad dental issues. I had him for 3 years before he passed due to having 1,500 white blood cells and his sinus infection. My free kitty shows no signs as of now. But I take his health seriously. 
Looks like he knows you only spent $10 to buy him.
He looks like he's tired of all the bullshit. I feel you, Hank.
I am also the proud owner of a sub $20 overweight old tuxedo cat. She’s the best.
I never really clicked with cats till just now. Hank looks like my brother. And I think they wouldn’t get along, like I’d panic if one saw me with the other, they’d think I’ve replaced them in my life.
He looks like a handsome, stuck up British aristocrat in cat form and I’m living for it
He looks like one of em cats who will gut you like a fish for looking at em the wrong way. Don't eyeball him! 
Hank? 
It's me, Connor. The android sent by Cyberlife.

Im sorry. 
[deleted]
Sweet of you to adopt him despite his diagnosis! I had neighbors once in college who had THIRTEEN house cats. Why? Because they all had herpes. The shelter would just call them up when they got a new one in to see if they had room. No one wanted them as they couldn't not live in a house with "clean" cats, so Sam and Karen just took them all in together! 
I love him
That expression paired with that name, classic. 

I can just imagine how many times you've yelled, "fuck you, Hank!". 
His face says "Fuck off."
He’s seen some shit 
Special kitties give us special human powers and make our hearts grow bigger. 
If Clint Eastwood was a cat 
I am a FIV shelter. Thank you so much for giving him a home!!
His eyes look so grumpy lol
Nice and congrats.  I had to put down a FIV+ kitten a year or so ago, it sucked bad.  My daughter was crushed.

&#x200B;
Lol @ the "better a poor person adopt the cat than it get put to sleep but that same argument magically doesn't apply to human abortion" reeeing
If you can’t afford a $100 cat you definitely shouldn’t get a cat 
[deleted]
[deleted]
Can't you just get them for free off the street?
My cat was 0 dollars 
[deleted]
If you cannot afford an 80$ cat, to shouldn't get a cat. 
People pay for cats?
I feel judged.
r/absoluteunits
Hank is one handsome boy

You might've paid 10$ for him OP, but in reality he is priceless ♥
Since when do people pay for cats? Not being rude but I've adopted all 3 of mine and honestly haven't seen anyone selling them for a price!
People pay for cats? I practically had to pay to get rid of mine.
FIV what does that mean
This has meme template potential.
😻😻😻
He seems like an irascible fellow but still a cutie 
Is FIV cat AIDs?
He looks like he hates you for taking the pic
I have an FIV tuxedo too! They’re the best ❤️
What a majestic man :) His expression is so no-nonsense.
What a magnificent beast!  I’m sure that he has been the most amazing companion over the last 7 years!
He looks dead inside 
FIV?
Hi hank 
Looks like he and my (recently passed) old bastard named Garbage would be old bar pals 
Hank: yeah f$&k you too u/michaelscottspenis love you
Here's a limerick: Hank, Hank, what a prick.

Beautiful cat.
Hank, the asshole cat. I like it!
TIL cats had an HIV equivalent.
FIV cats can be the best! At the shelter, I used to work at, there was always a few that loved to be pet and snuggle with anyone. I wish more people gave them a chance. 
Perfect unit! You’re not letting him roam outside tho right? If he fights or fucks he could be giving it to other cats
Awww. He’s adorable! What’s his last name? Anderson? Also Tuxes have a totally royal attitude, I know, I had one. But they’re pretty god dang cute
Milo... is that you?
If this kitty is a carrier he will live LONG into adult hood...if he is actively being infected and slowly dying...

Just hope this dude is a carrier! Mine was and lived to be 22!
Absolute unit
He is cute but also surly looking. 
Whats FIV
That cat looks like such an asshole. 

I want to adopt it. Too bad ya beat me to it. 
I have 3 FIV+ older cats and they are the best cats ever! So sweet to me and to each other. FIV+ kitties need love too! 
He C H O N K

He mad

But most import

For meeting OP, he's glad.
He's so crabby looking and I love him!
Huggles hank looks awesome 
Aw I love Hank 
Hank you wonderful prick! Nice to meet you. Handsome fellow he is. 
I once knew a dog named Hank. He was the bestest boy. I miss Hank.
Kitty Hank looks like a good boy too. Pls give scritches from me. 
Your cat is low key Ron Perlman 
That's Sir Henry to you, plebe human! Props to Hank!
For those who don't know, FIV is pretty much cat AIDS. My uncle had a cat who had it and I gave it it's medicine when I was cat-sitting
My 21-year-old cat only cost me £5 in 1998. She's worth every penny and more. 
Black and white cats with black noses are superior to all other cats; I am cat racist and not ashamed of it. 
He looks like the kind of fella who always carries a can of wd40. And a mini can just in case the first one's top gets stuck.
What is FIV, is that a type of disease cats get? 
My tux lived to 23 and even though past owners said he was mean and bitter, he was the sweetest cat I've ever owned in the 8 years we had him. He had dementia and acted just like a kitten in his last few years, and even though I'm not certain if he recognized us, he'd always purr loudly when held or cuddled.
He really does look like a prick, a magnificent prick!!
I love him!
Hank is majestic af bro 
What’s FIV?
Hi Hank 👋
That expression, wow!
I fuck with Hank. 
He looks so badass, a really beautiful and badass cat
I’ve got a FIV positive boy named hank as well. Great cat
He’s like a cute little grandpa cat, tired of your shit but still lovey & cute 
That is a whole lot of prime cat you have there
Hank looks like the kind of cat that has a couple of tattoos on him.
Shit where I'm from they will probably pay you to take their cats
He has charisma, style and sophistication. It's written all over him.💓
What a adorable cat!
All hail Hank! The magnificent prick!
I just lost my FIV kitty a few weeks ago. Your cat looks awesome :) give him hugs!
“I was told I would only have to put up with you bastards for like 2 years. 12 years on and I’m still here. FML.”
Hank is the purrfect name for this cat.
This is so wholesome. He's so cute. 
Thank you for taking in an FIV+
Hank...Welcome 
Looks like Japanese swordsman lol
Hank looks like my Maggie. She’s 16. 
Hank looks cranky. 


He also looks really cute!
Hi Hank!
I’ve never seen a cat more appropriately wear its name than Hank.
Hello Hank!  You are a handsome fellow!
Perfect name for him.   And you can see at a glance his total disdain for all things around him.  😏
I've never seen a cat who fit their name more perfectly. 
I can't really pinpoint why, because I'm a total dog person, but FIV positive cats tug on my heart strings. Hello, Hank. 
Nice username
He looks very smug. :)
That's the Hankiest Hank that ever Hanked.
What a dude, gorgeous 
Handsome cat. 
Question, what is FIV? 
That is one glorious-looking bastard! My rescue turns 12 this year.

BTW, that porch looks kinda familiar... do you live in Athens, per chance?
That cat is sick of your shit Steve.
Should have named him Toby
Hank resents being sold for $10.00. To this very day.
>He's a magnificent prick

that's what she said...
He so looks like a Hank
It is truly an honor to meet you, Hank.
May you continue your ways for years to come.
I used to date a girl in NJ whose father was a retired Marine Drill-Sargeant... his name was Hank.

Your Hank reminds me a lot of that Hank. Also a bastard!

Cool cat though!
Whats fiv?
Yet another Ron Pearlman cat
Hank looks like he's constantly having to take care of 3+ toddlers with no down time, I love him
"hey Bub, you got a light?" 
That face says it all. 
He just looks like he’s thinking “Get off my lawn.”
Why does that cat have such “Hank” energy. Purrrfect name for him.
Your cat is actually Archer’s cat.  He’s just watching you. 
Awwww. I had a 17 year old cat with FIV. Grew up with me from childhood to adult life. I miss her so much.
You cat embodies Jim Lahey.
What is FIV?
Very cool of you that you adopted an older cat, regardless of how much he cost. He's a handsome boy and you gave him a good home. Good job! 
Hank is such a perfect name for that kittums 
Priceless.
Absolute mad respect for anyone adopting, taking in such a critter.  So many only want 'perfect'.  Newsflash, best love isn't perfect. 
Is adopting from a shelter expensive?
He looks wise.
Oh hey, Hank! 
He looks like his name should be snake!
looks like he wants to sell me propane and propane accessories and someone said charcoal is better than propane 
He looks like he has no fucks to give. Magnificent.
I thought he had the best handlebar mustache 
That cat looks how I feel about everything in life.
He looks like a glorious Prick
Hank has that perfect prick look about him. I’m sure he is magnificent at it 👍🏻
He is judging me over the internet
Aww, I just adopted an FIV+ little guy! He's also lost the tips of his ears and his voice to frostbite. However, he's the most loving cat ever! He follows me around making little chirps, and cuddles at every opportunity. Here's my Squeaks: https://imgur.com/Emfga5H.jpg
Got my two trash gremlins from a lady on Craig’s list with no teeth 
This cat looks like a Hank. There is no other choice
Got my first kitty for 50 öre per paw, about 2 cent. She was magnificent. I miss you Sissi!
Hank you are the best!! ♥️♥️
Looks Rotten to the Core ! Good Kat !
My rescued tuxedo cat is also named Hank!
What’s fiv 
Correction: $10 + $3.6k for food over 7 years.
I wonder how many fucks he has to give?
Hank is rather dapper looking now he just needs a monocle.
Hank looks like a fucking Hank
I remember Hank, probably the best forklift driver we had. Always showed up on time, never complained and worked hard. Glad to see he's doing well in retirement. 
Jesus christ. What's with all the backstory on reddit these days? 
Hi Hank, Reddit loves you ❤️
Pricing on cats has always been weird to me.  I’ve seen a Persian in a pet store for $800, a young calico in petco for $150, and even 2 year old cats in pounds for $80. My last two cats were $15 in a shelter for my torbie (w/ $25 extra for FIV test) who was 7 months old and $45 (another $25 for the same) who was one and a half years old. These two are the sweetest cats I’ve ever had and they were left alone because people thought they weren’t playful enough or young enough to adopt.
He's meowvalous
Hank the CHONK 😍😍😍
I love him. This means so much to me. 
First of all, love your username. Secondly,  he's a handsome boy! And lastly, People give away kittens all the time around here! 
So classy in that tux! Looking good Hank!!
Oh wow aren't cats with FIV expected to live only five years or so?
I'm just so pleased Michael Scott's penis ended of getting his own pet. I always thought he should have one.
He looks like a baboon, cat, and a dog at the same time
Got an Aids cat myself, going on 3!
Congratulations! He has a magnificent face!

We just lost our beautiful FIV+ furbaby. I think it’s such a shame that they don’t get adopted! If our landlord would let us have another kitty, I’d be running to the shelter right now to get one. The house is far too empty these days. 

[Check out this fluffy belly, though!](https://i.imgur.com/28Fo3Jn.jpg)
Anyone else get a Ron Pearlman vibe looking at this cat?
I also have a magnificent ahole pom for cheap too. Love the little shit 
Why didn’t you go outside of Walmart they give them away for free.
Brought a tear to my eye... Give that basterd some good food
He’s glorious. 
He has almost identical markings to my childhood cat! My cat was named “Mean One” because her face looked mean like yours! We also called her “Treetrunks” sometime because her legs were thicc af!
Hank, you magnificent prick - I read your book!!
Gday hank 
This is the kind of cat where you'd say, "He's a mean old son of a bitch." 

But you'd say it like you wished he was your dad.
I just imagine him saying "damnit Connor"
Username checks out
How do you afford a cat as a college student? Main complaint I typically hear is they're "broke". I graduated, but didn't see myself owning a pet like a dog or cat during those years.  
Hank is AMAZING!
I like Hank.
Hes beautiful. I lost my tuxedo cat last week at 19 years old. He lived a long time and I hope Hank does too. Gentlemen in tuxes!
Perfect name.   This cat looks like it should be robbing banks with the O'driscoll gang.
Smug bastard
one of my cats is FIV+!! she's the best little thing in the world.
Hank does not look amused.
I love Hank and need more pictures of him in my life. You should make an Instagram for him!
Hello sir Hank! 
"wutchyew lookin at?!" Hank, probably. 
in america everything has to be a business...
I woulda paid 12
Omg. he's amazing! 😍
Cheap bastards best bastards
Hank looks like Ron Perlman
[And the name's Hank, fuckface](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y27IHhe6hZY)...
He looks like an asshole. 
I hate fiv?
Whoa what a beautiful boi
I love Hank. 
Awesome, he looks like he'd try and smother you while you're asleep. 
Truly a magnificent specimen. Cats like him make me wish I was not allergic to them!
I temporarily had a cat named Tuco (breaking bad), as he was a tuxedo cat and Tuco Tuxedo was a slick use of alliteration (humble brag). He was probably a long lost of relative or distant friend of Hank’s. 
Any special care needed for an FIV cat?
Mate I wanna cry about this. Trying so hard not to. Gorgeous. Thank you xx
I'm sure Hank feels that you are the  bestest magnificent prick ever! Great things happen to great people. 
Aw!! Handsome little man. My little buddy Walnut is also FIV+ but he’s a happy healthy munchkin. Glad Hank is doing well too!!
My guy’s name is Hank!!!
Your going to regret taking that picture.
My cat is FIV positive as well and she's the bestest derpiest cat ever. I took her to the  vet right after  and found out she had  an eye and respiratory infection but she's worth the $350 to make her feel better :)
We lost our cat last year unexpectedly to FIV 😢
Haha look at that face. Best stink eye ever.
What's FIV? 
Hank has seen some shit. Sweet old curmudgeon ❤️ 
Immunodeficiency Viruses in most animals are nowhere near the severity of the Human variety. HIV is pretty serious, but even with FIV a cat can live a normal lifespan without any special care or meds.

If I didn't have an uninfected cat, I would not hesitate to get an FIV+ cat or three.
Hank takes no shit!
He has a Ron Perlman vibe to him :P
I too have a Hank that had FIV as a kitten, what a coincidence. Here, have an upvote
Cute
Hank could easily steal anyone's girl
He's seen shit. 
I don’t even like cats that much, but Hank looks like one I could ride with 🙌🏼
You're lucky! My poor baby had FIV and barely made it past one years old :( 
He looks like an evil master mind. Good choice!
What does FIV do to a cat? Does it just weaken their immune system? Do they give it to other cats? Do you have to medicate them?
Why would you pay for an animal? 
He is stunning! I'm in love 😍
You can just tell he doesn't give a flying fuck. Awesomeness 
FIV = face in va....?! That's quite a creative way to get a discount on a p....  kitty
Frank is a complete fucking unit
Got me thinking now because you said cheap. Almost all of my cats and even a lot of my moms and dads we literally just found them outside or they came to the house. It's been a weird cycle. Whenever there's a time one of us doesnt have one around after a month or two a cat either shows up and throws a coup d'état, or we make friends with a stray.
He looks magnificent
What's fiv 
How has he been with you throughout the years? We love a lovable bastard.

>**7 years ago I wanted the cheapest cat ever.**

Also, for some reason, this is legit wholesome - it's like, I'd do anything for a cat. Share the love. 
Hank... is not amused. 
Tuxedos all look at you like they could do better lol mine looks at me like that and Hanks got that face nailed down! He’s very handsome :) 
I hope that’s the way you talk to him.  It humanizes him. 
Ron Perlman. Or should I say Hank Purrlman. 
alpha as fuck
What’s FIV? 
If looks could kill. 
whats FIV.. lol. EDIT: nvm i googled it.. sorry i thought it had to do with his cool black and white V neck Suit. lol. (fancy I-something suit) lol. cool dude. ok bye now lol
I know a Hank. He's a prick to. But still my life long friend.
firtsbornunicorn
GOD DAMN YOU MARIE, THEY ARE NOT ROCKS, THEY ARE MINERAAAAALS. 

I read that as car at first so when I saw a pic of a cat, I was super confused. 
The look on his face is priceless!! What an awesome cat :)
Fuck you Hank. My fucking cat Libby and her bastard dog brothers all salute your fucking magnificence. 
Hi Hank!
Maybe a dumb question... what's FIV?
Hank fits him too well.
What is FIV?
He looks truly magnificent!
25yrs ago I adopted this little guy from a farm for free, he was my best frd, my loved one and I will do it again today after know what I have to give up and what I been thought.  He had FIV I found out much later and developed diabetes later in life, he lived till 16.

What I am trying to say is don't let FIV scare you, I am sure he already is your best frd.
I would love to snuggle your Hank.

I lost my FIV boy the day after Christmas two months ago.  He only made it 4 years. :(

This was Oscar https://i.imgur.com/oFYl1hV.jpg
Looks like a real world Greebo from Discworld
You’re not just sure he’s the best cat, you’re FIV positive
Is it like HIV but for Felines?
Just lost my 12 year old cat, Nose to FIV a few months ago. He was fine then all of a sudden one month he started getting sick. It got worse week after week then after a couple of days he refused to eat or drink water and I knew it was time to put him down so he wouldn’t suffer any longer. FIV is weird, some cats live less than 10 years old and some more than 15. Hope Hank lives a full happy life!
If Ron Perlman were a cat. [But apparently there's an even better one](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/6klrln/ron_perlman/_)
He looks so stuck up. Yet so glorious 
Has the face of an old alcoholic.
Looks like Tom Waits
He's seen things
👍 for prick Hank
He's seen some shit.
Hi Hank!
Tehe 😮♥️
I miss my old cat Stinky. Got him "free." Read several hundred for neutering, shots, and then nearly a grand for various fight related vet visits. I miss that glorious bastard. Most expensive free companion i ever had. Worth every cent.
😊😘
Hank looks the way I feel,  but doesn't have to put on a facade.
He really looks like he’s plotting your demise.
Any cat will judge. I like yours particularly because I feel he has 3 solid reasons at all given times and is getting really sick of it.
You spelt “cutest cat ever” wrog 
Yup. Definetily a hank 
I can just tell on the look of Hank' s face he doesn't take shit from anybody.
[Nora](https://i.imgur.com/PF7LPfY.png)
My kitty Nora is 9 year old $5 shelter cat. I adopted her a year and a half ago 😊. I call her 5 dollar cat haha 
What a stud!! 
Yep. That’s a cat. 
Hell yah. Good on you for taking a cat with fiv.
I think he knows you called him a prick. He's not happy about it.
I love his name.
When my parents' vet found out their kitten had FIV, he offered to euthanize her immediately. 9 week old kitten.

My mom literally snatched her back and she's 9 years old now so yeah fuck that guy and glory to her and to Hank up here. 
He’s fabulous!  
Some shelters apparently give pets away for free on certain days (when they're trying to clear out, I assume) and it's pretty awesome. I think you still have to pay for certain things, which I assume you don't have to do when you paid the ten dollars, but still pretty good and my family got our two family cats out of it. 

Very adorable cat, I rate it nine point nine points out of ten, because the mark on half his chin is annoying me a bit. Very cute.
Love Hank!!!!
He looks done with your shit, Linda.
Cool name
That look though
Oof
What is FIV? Asking for a friend...
There was a girl in front of a grocery store in Pleasanton, California as we were walking inside. I was about 8 years old. She had a box with two cats in it. She said she just wanted them to have a home. No charge.


I begged my mom and she said no. As we were in the store shopping, she picked out a litter box, toys, cat food- all cat accessories and necessities. 


Oh our way out we picked up one of the cats. He was black and white. We named him Oreo.   He infested out house with fleas. The amount of fleas on our carpet was disgusting, but we got it all taken care of. He was with us for 16 years. He was the most affectionate and loving cat and my very first bond with an animal. He taught me how pets are more than just pets- they’re family. He was worth being a pain in the ass little cat. I love him and miss him so much everyday.
Typical cat looks like he doesn't have a care in the world, and you can see he is refusing to acknowledge that camera. Had a tuxedo cat that made it to 19 1/2 The only time I have cried as an adult was when I was told that his time had come, he was my loveable arsehole for nearly 20 years, I still miss his grumpy face.
We had a tuxedo Tom and he was a tremendous prick. A real fucking asshole. We loved him - he brought me mice and then dropped them on my chest while I slept and I’d wake up horrified. I miss him so much. RIP Mr. Biscuit 
He even *looks* like a magnificent prick.
Hank cost you lots more than 10$. Food and litter. 
I want a cat so bad. But a few people in my family are allergic to them 😭
Looks like he belongs on a wanted poster 
Love the name!
Fitting name. He looks like a tough motherfucker, who don’t take no shit from nobody.
OMG, so cute. I wish i could have a cat again, but i'm allergic :(
I went to the shelter to get a kitten for my daughter. One cage had about 10 kittens. They were all rolling around being cute. One was reaching out to swipe at everyone that walked by the cage. I chose her. 11 years later and she’s my favorite buddy. 
He looks like a Hank. Well named my friend.
This is the best post I’ve seen on Reddit. Congrats. 
Glorious Bastard. 
I can hear the gruff voice going "Why the hell are you taking my picture? *Again?*"
Looks like Ron Perlman's cat
Why does hank look like jax's step father in sons of anarchy 
"Hank the ten buck prick" has a nice ring to it
I love him! 😍
I think Tux's are loveable jerks. Mine is the most snuggliest, loviest, jerkface I've ever met.
She slapped me in the face with both paws when we went to pick her out.
I named her Hussy. 
Hank looks like he’s done 3 tours of Vietnam. Killers eyes.
He looks like a Hank.. I had a Hank, he was called Fred.
Hank looks like Ron Perlman https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTmm66uyP-prrjkieoINcKNMl6F0nP-NShlgRxe-GGwfGF3bWSi
My tuxedo guy Jambalaya was diagnosed with FIV at about age 2 or 3. He lived to age 12. 

Hank is cool looking!
Hank looks like quite the asshole. I have three cats, I know an asshole cat when I see one. Magnificent bastard.
FIV?
My cat was 50 mexican pesos or about 2.5 USD, best money I've ever spent
He looks like a hank
My cat was $5 (to adopt) because she was a black cat, "old" (10 years old), and had been at the shelter longer than six months.

She's a loveable jerk with fussy needs and a mouth that fits her name she came with (Heckle), but.....oh I love her so much. No buyer's regret at all.
