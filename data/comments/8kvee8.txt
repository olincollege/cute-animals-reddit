that s a nice hat he's wearing. 
*Update 

I have just told my dad that over 150k people have seen his photo on Reddit and people think he looks like woody Harrelson.

He‚Äôs replied: what is a Reddit and I wish I had his money. 
Fuck...Daddest looking dad to ever dad
The pool of lips on his head is killing me....god damn your dad... thank him for me 
your dad is woody harrelson? 
boxers are seriously the best dogs. mine does shit like this all the time. i love it.

Dog-cheek helmet for the win. 
Does it come with complimentary drool drips too?
Retire from  selfies. You‚Äôre batting 1000
Droop√©e
Im pretty sure all boxers do this.
HAT BOYE
Boxers are the best dog
I have a boxer too! They are tons of fun!
Boxers are the best. Clowns. They don't even have to try. I miss my Houdini.
He may as well stop now. He‚Äôs mastered it.
There's a dog growing out of your dad's head
Please let this be the Christmas card this year
That scar is fucking badass 
That's a pretty substandard toupee!
We refer to our boxer as a scarf because she likes to curl up around our necks. Doesn't matter that she is almost 60 pounds! 
"Okay, now teach me how to order this on one of those canvas picture things, I need a new one to go above my favorite chair."

"Oh, you're going to make a gallery wall?"

"No."
So your dad props his chin on a random guy's head?
Which one is the dad? 
That‚Äôs a handsome boy ! He‚Äôs a good boy. I have two boxers. 
Both my Rottie and Pit do this! 
Doesn't even look that old. Probably not much older than me. How could he have not figured out how the selfie camera works within 6 minutes of owning the phone.
I think your dog is melting. 

Give it a chill pill.
 Why is the dog melting? 
Your dad's beard looks awfully like a man. 
good way to cover a bald spot
Dogs really have no sense of personal space. Sometimes it's endearing, other times...not so much. 
Wow, this royal wedding hat trend is really making people get creative. Anywho, it's a lovely hat. 10/10 would wear.
Is that you as a baby in that pic up top?
Very cool! Who‚Äôs the guy he‚Äôs resting his head on?
He oddly resembles Woody Harrelson.
Looks like his hat is part hound's tooth.
The slobber works as good as Rogaine u know...
Oh man, what's the story behind that scar?
Hilarious. My wife and I have two boxers. This picture is everyday life with a boxer. Best. Dogs. Ever. 
Can you call it ‚Äútea bagging‚Äù if it‚Äôs with droopy cheeks instead of balls?
Well congrats to your dad, it looks like he won the internet today. 
Look at the way the dog's jowls florp over the sides of your dad's head. That's quality content. Thanks!
Is that stack stone wallpaper?
Tell him I like his toupee
I'm totally getting the Woody Harrelson vibe, this is great.
Is he here to talk about Rampart?
At first glance it looks like the dog is sucking on the man's head like a sucker fish lol. Or maybe it's just me
Another Rampart is coming out?
thats one fine hat harry
Love your dad. And his hair piece 
Now that is a perfect first time! 
This is incredibly adorable!!! 
Does your Dad happen to know of a big shot gangster putting together a crew?
The dog is melting
this isnt even related to rampart
Hi this is my dog but let's not get off topic I'm here to talk about Rampart
Good boy/Bad boy. Good boy is keeping bad boy in his seat! 
Boxers are the goofiest lol. 
Boxes are the sweetest! Props to your dad for sharing this. 
I accidentally opened the front camera 
Well, that's quite an interesting (and adorable) hat your dad is wearing!
And his last when I get to him
I love boxers so much they‚Äôre so cute. 
Is your dad a fat Woody Harrelson?
Ah, the accidental, 'now i got to explain to dad why he's on the front page of the internet' post.
Your dad looks like fat woody harrelson with the best good boy ever. 
Who run Bartertown?
Awe floppy dog jowls are so funny
/r/faketitle
he looks like Woody Harrelson's brother
Boxers are the best.. It's cliche because it's true
It's a designer hat fit for a royal wedding.
Is your dad woody harrelson‚Äôs fat older brother? 
He can quit now! One and done
He looks like woody harrelson 
Your dad kinda looks like woody harrelson
I wish my dad was Woody Harrelson
he looks like Woody Harrelson
I thought your dad was Woody Harrelson
Is your dad Woody Harrelson?

Is your dad Woody Harrelson?
Woody Harrelson? Is that you? 
When people look like their pets. üòç
He look fairly young to know so little about technology 
Is your dad Jesse James?
Is your dad chubby Woody Harrelson?
Why does your dad look like the love child of Woody Harrelson and an oval
Your dad looks vaguely similar to Rub Dukes from Exodus. Cool photo. 
Hat-dawg
Haaat-daaaawwg

His scar is so cool!!! Total badass, the dog compliments it nicely. 
u/notshaggythemoshdog  come back to Reddit I miss you
Worth the wait!
[deleted]
English mastiff? I have one with a fawn coat too :)
Yeah, we've been seeing these "my parent finally figured out their smartphone" posts for 10 years now. There is no way you're going to convince me anyone below 60 is using a smartphone for the first time in 2018. Also, front cameras are usually not hard to figure out. This particular dad moreover looks pretty young (50s, maybe 60s tops, hard to tell with the dog on his face). So I'm sorry, not buying the whole dad story. 

Just tell us you're posting a weird selfie of your father, uncle or - most likely - yourself to Reddit. But Reddit is like a well trained dog: A smart title can make thousands of people upvote your post. It's incredible. 

EDIT: okay people, I didn't want to sound like a total dick. And thanks for the cool headed replies below (no sarcasm). 

I just find it a pity that every picture nowadays needs some kind of wholesome or sad story. The picture is funny on itself and that should be enough.
Im not sure why but your fathers face resembles me Woody Harrelson
Pretty old to just have figured out how to use the front camera
Your dad must have really long arms 
Solid
Glorious 
Dem food lips.
And what a good one it was. +1 for snuggle pup. 
The joy and happiness in their faces after discovering how to use the front camera is unmistakable. Yep. Happy happy joy joy 
Your dad is a quick learner. Best front facing photo I've seen this month
‚ÄúDog hat‚ÄùüòÇ
TIL jouel hats are quite fashionable
Your dad looks like an certain actor who often plays the role of a bad guy. I can't remember his name.
Is this the hat he wore to the royal wedding?
It's a hat, it's a brooch, it's a pterodactyl!
Is this TODD with two boxers in Texas? If so I used to walk his dogs! 
I guess woody harrelson found more twinkies
Pupper wants love and attention. I would have loved to see a video of the dog getting up there in the first place. 
He looks like my dad. Hope he isn‚Äôt a Stephen. 
That is definitely an r/squishypuppers!
This is the kind of A+ quality content that the internet should have been created for. 
My folks are 72. Still don‚Äôt text 
next tf2 hat? 
Looks like your dad's flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet.
I think your dad has it all figured out.
That‚Äôs awesome!
It's Fred Flintstone! 
The best!
This photo is great. Enjoy the upvote. 
I like his hat 
Doggo and daddio
Tell your dad that he has great taste in hats.
The selfie game is strong with this one.
The eyes on that man. No homo.
already a master
Your dad replaced his hair with drool 

Think about the drool 

My god just your head covered in drool 

Cute dog 


But the *drool*
Looks like they both worked really hard to figure it out
Lol
frame this please 
So cute
How do i remove this sub from my feed?
When owners look like their animals lol jk. Boxers are a fun dog to own
For the love of god explain the SCAR!
Your dads beard looks oddly like a middle aged white man
Doggo drool... best hair-growth tonic known to man
Your dad seems awesome. 
Nice Ideco Home Wallpaper - Stone Sand Stone - A17203.
Jesus Woody, you really let yourself go...
Nice hat! Does it stay on when its windy?
hi
Begone thought
Clearly that's a wig. 
thought it was hair at first
Your dad is great !
I have a cane corso mastiff and the first thing I noticed in the picture were the big ole cheeks on that dog. Which also means that it must hold a gallon of water after the pooch is done drinking. Must follow with towel at all times haha
Is your dad Woody Harrelson?
I can‚Äôt tell where the dog ends and dad begins
Your dad looks like he‚Äôs seen some things. He‚Äôs the kind of guy who survives when his plane goes down in a zombie apocalypse after a nuclear war.
He's like Thanos but with the chin on the head.
Which ones your dad?
The black muzzle kinda made your dad look like he had a pompodour for a minute!
Boxers are the best! My family has always owned a boxer. They‚Äôre wonderful 
he's really cute, I may even wanna take him home and cuddle with him. Oh yeah, so is the dog.
Rofl came here to say what the top comment already says.
Haha, literally every boxer ever!
Your dad has a cool scar.  
Love it ! üòÇ
Dad wuvs dat dawg.
***Jowls.***
.....am everywhere 
He's not just figured out how to use the front camera really though has he. Let's be honest.
Cool he learned to take selfies.

Who's the guy under his jowls?
The Beast!
I gotta ask cause your dad looks kinda familiar to me. Does he support Manchester United? Is this dog called Trafford? 
Your dad looks like that guy from that movie 
What kind of wall/stone would you call that? Only ever seen something like that on the exterior or as a backsplash
Nice wall treatment. Is that his residence? Links to the product? I want to install an accent wall just like that.
I like his hat
TIL what woody harrelson + john goodman's offspring would look like. 

Also, you're dad's got himself one adorable, jowly boy. :)


R/squishypuppers
Your dad has a sick forehead scar, and I‚Äôm being honest 
Let‚Äôs focus on the movie, people
Just a dad being a dad
95 thesis
Gru is the most powerful being in the universe, and here‚Äôs why: according to the height of a Minion (which is 3.5 feet on average) Gru is 4 minions tall, which means he is a godly size of 14 feet tall.   Second if any of you remember the original Despicable Me, you Know there is a scene when Vector kidnaps the three girls and shoots a series of heat-seeking misses at Gru, he then dodge them all. According to the speed of an average ballistic missile (1900 mph) and the size of the missile according to his ankle size, Gru can perceive and move at such a speed that the missiles only move 9.5 miles per hour, 0.5% of their original speed.   Plus after this Gru punches a shark and it is paralyzed meaning its spine is probably shattered, to remind you it would require a force greater than 3,000 newtons to fracture the spine. That‚Äôs equal to the impact created by a 500-pound car crashing into a wall at 30 miles per hour. I rest my case.
He should quit now. I don't think he could possibly take a more perfect picture.
This is an awesome picture! 
Drooling head!... drooling head!...
Boxers are the best.
That's awesome!
Merle Dixon?
Who is he resting his head on?
Why does this guy look like he is sponsoring me in the hunger games?

Boxers are the best! My girl passed away 2 years ago and I miss her so much. They are amazing companions, so loyal. She was as dumb as they come, but so loving and affectionate that it never mattered to us.

Wet cap of jowls
This did make me laugh. What a goofball dog. :) your Dad must have a great time with him. 
Is it safe?
A guy with a dog. And 80k. strange.
I read this as ‚Äúmy dog has just figured out how to use the front camera‚Äù

I thought it was an insult. 


What‚Äôs the problem? Looks fine to me.  
You should post this in Photoshop Battles. I'm sure your Pops will enjoy what these wacky Redditors come up with.
Woody Harrelson let himself go a bit between movies.
That dog, picture is worth a thousand texts

What a great head warmer!
Your dad looks like Woody Harrelson's big brother
Woody harrelson??
They‚Äôre both adorable. 

The only boxer I ever met was at a party where I really didn‚Äôt know anyone - it was my then-husband‚Äôs coworkers, and this boxer was the only dog there. I kept talking to him and petting him as he made the rounds, socializing, and after about an hour he came back and just climbed up into my lap. It was so sweet. I‚Äôve wanted a boxer ever since. 
Your dad is woody Harrelson???
Dogat
Solid. 
Woody Harrelson has gained some weight
You deserve all of this karma
r/rarepuppers

I'm fairly sure that's not his natural hair.
Such a sweet photo. 
Good to know - that sucks. I‚Äôm sorry you lost your buddy so soon.
Couldn't really got a better photo, this is lovely
