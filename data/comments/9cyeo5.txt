That dog. "In case i die. I love you."
You can tell that the dog thinks the baby is cute 
That "Thanks for showing me" kiss. D'awww.
The dog is smart. The dude is wearing a military uniform so they're probably on a base, and the second anyone steps on that green an E-8 will appear out of nowhere and start screaming about keeping off the grass.
"Alright little man... if you aren't afraid of it then I'll try to kill it."
"Stand back kid, let me show you how to fight the water monster!"
Awww I was that age when my parents adopted ‚Äúmy‚Äù GSD.  They make the best friends/guardians. 
every child needs a dog 
I‚Äôve always thought GSDs funnel every ounce of bravery toward strangers.  Because when it comes to everything else, they are scared to death.  
I absolutely love how the doggy kisses his toddler buddy before he goes for it! 
Done same thing when my puppy was afraid of water come out hose. So i show him with that  i drink out of it and then he start to drink out of it.

Is it just me or does that child have incredibly long arms?
I‚Äôm a simple man; I see a dog and a baby being friends, I cry.
That is one smart puppo
Two of the most pure creatures communicating - warms my dead heart
I love the face kiss before attacking the sprinkler 
The fact that the dog goes to lick the Baby first gets me.
Did you know dogs are one of the few animals that respond to human gestures like pointing. Although they do not understand in the same way we do.  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7531526_A_comparative_analysis_of_animals'_understanding_of_the_human_pointing_gesture
Did that toddler come out of the womb with fully grown arms or something? Yikes those are not normally that long
This looks more like a dog that is all too familiar with sprinklers and can't wait to go crazy and attack the water, but the small human is nearby and the dog knows it must be good and calm when the small human is around.
good god the cuteness is through the roof
The dog was basically saying "bro, if I don't make it, you can have my chew toys."
That is wonderful communication between a toddler and his canine pal. 
"I trust you" 
the "thank you fren" lick <3
Anyone else love that the kid is holding the dad's hat the whole time?
A dog a baby a military dad and something cute/funny happening. Looks like I found a basic summary of the internet 
The dogs just like, ‚Äúin case I die... I love you. IM GOING IN!‚Äù
"Ok hooman *smooch* I'll do my best! :3"
I'm just worried about that Airman not having his cover on outside.
Best dang thing I've seen all day. 
Children who grow up with animals learn kindness and empathy. Good job Mom and Dad.
This is so pure.
Every shepherd I have ever had is always strangely compelled to attack water jets.  I cannot wash my car without locking her in the house
A dog, a toddler and a guy in a military uniform. Guaranteed 50k upvotes.
Is this about the age where they have the same basic intelligence?
The boy in the striped pajamas
r/humansbeingbros
Can animals comprehend that human babies aren't full grown people
The kid's more like "Do the thing! Do the thing! Yes! I love it when he does that!"
Love that the dog kisses him for giving him the lesson :)
Amazing how a baby human can already communicate with a dog so effectively.
Am I the only one that had a heart skip a beat the way he approached his head? 

Looked for a split second like he was going to bite...
That baby has Popeyes forearms !
What the. .. why does everything on reddit make me cry??
Gives him a kiss first 
Omg what a coupla good bois

COOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!!!!!!!!

The bestest buddy of all buddies!!! 
That soldier needs to put his cover back on.
The relationship between a dog and a child is probably the purest and most innocent .

It‚Äôs heartwarming.
That kiss
Best friends for lyfe

‚ÄúHuh? Woah it‚Äôs wet, lemme try‚Äù

Gives him a kiss first 
I like the kiss the dog gives before going for the water 
"I see your point but im going to kill it jist in case" - Dog
I want a dog like that 
My heart can't cope with the purity of this
I love the thank you kiss.
I will never not upvote this, so cute. 
That "Thanks for showing me" kiss. D'awww.

You can see the dog‚Äôs body language that he/she is ready the tackle the second something happened to the baby, man i love dogs
Thank you for showing me this, tiny thing.

Oh, my hearttt
Why do babies and dogs get along so well?? It's like they can understand each other!
The noises I made watching this.  
Thank god I'm alone.
The dog had done this before and the baby wanted it to do it again.   My doggo did this at the park but always waited patiently for the kids to get out of the way.  Corgi's can be obsessive about people waiting their turn in line.
That toddler is pretty cool but Shepherds are super awesome!
i just want the dog
Ok that was the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life.
And the dog! He believed it and went for it!
I absolutely love how the dog kisses the kid right before attacking the water.
I love the posts here but I rarely actually say "aww" when I see a post. This one made me say "aww". In fact, it may have been more of an "awwwww". So cute!
"Y-you see, it's just water." ***splash splash*** "See?"

"OH so I can drink it! Thanks buddy!"  ***lick*** 

***garglalglal***
German Shepard are amazing, my dad had one when we were kids and it would pull you out of the water because she thought you were drowning and wanted to keep you safe.
GSDs are such good dogs. 
"A.. are you okay??"  

"And YOU!! Don't! Touch! Myfriend!!"
This is a Reddit resipe made in heaven, we got a toddler, a adorable dog, and and a dad in army uniform
Omg this is amazing! Someone comfort me before I die ü§óü§óü§ó from this cutie 
Man, I love G-sheps.
r/repost
Hek, ok little Hooman, you touch, I eatz. 
This right here is why dogs are considered mans best friend üíï That baby boy will be that dogs lifelong friend. & That dog will protect that child from all harm.  I have never been able to wrap my head around the fact that people can abuse animals. All our fur babies want is our love and affection... this truly is a beautiful video ‚ù§Ô∏è
Anyone else reading this like the kid dared the dog?
My favorite part is when the baby puts his hand in the sprinkler, takes it out and looks at doggo and says ‚Äúyou see?‚Äù While pointing to the sprinkler.
I like how the dog gave a kiss before saying hey stand back, and then ngaw ngaw ngaw on that water monster. I bet it wasnt afraid of it anyway but to please the child.  I love this a lot. Thanks fot sharing :D :D
Very cute when he kisses the baby
That's a german shepherd. So the thinking was something like "family cub cannot kill object. Stay back kiddo I got this."
I tried to show my dogs that the vacuum was safe and for the rest of the day they didn't go anywhere near me.
Aww
One of the best scenes in saving toddler ryan
Honestly I would upvote this 50 times if I could
This is nothing like my pup. With him it was love at first sight when he saw a sprinkler
I like how the baby points after the first time he touches the stream.
A cute baby, a cute dog, and a soldier. The three ingredients needed to make easy karma
That kiss is the epitome of how wolves became mans most trusted friend. 
I love that little lick of permission before he tried the sprinkler. 

Like ‚Äúthanks bud. I‚Äôm going in.‚Äù 
Everybody‚Äôs talking about the ‚Äúthanks‚Äù kiss. Dog definitely was about to murder said baby but got distracted by the sprinkler 
Tommy and spike irl 
If anything kid is probably trying to get the dog to do the trick
dog is cute, but i was a little scared when the dog went to lick the toddlers face.
See! This is a good title. No lying and no ‚ÄúThey play together every day with the sprinkler‚Äù type shit. 
Thank you internets.  Its been a hectic day.
This is amazing we need more of this

C
Did you get that dog from a family in New Hampshire? 
My shepherd just puts his moth over it and slobbers on the grass 
That baby has grown up arms
Omgosh .. thats ADORABLE !! 

Awwwwwwuuhh !!üíöüíô
Kids going to be a daredevil when he grows up.
Love this!
Oldie but goodie

/r/wholesomememes levels of camaraderie here.
Very cute!

Side note. Do the arms on that kid seem abnormally long?
When he points at it, that face.
Kids gonna have a mean streak of awesome.
Hooyah Navy!
Not gonna lie I was hoping the toddler was gonna be sent flying by the water pressure. Go ahead and judge me; comedy trumps sympathy.
"HA take that sprinkler!! Aaaaand again because I'm still alive HA!!"

Oh my god! That‚Äôs exactly what he was doing!
Ok thanks for letting me know it‚Äôs safe I kiss you now from good boy! 
Cool
What good bois
leave it to the navy dad to have his kid teach a dog to fight water.
I always make time to thank  our religious passengers with military babies for their service üò§ 
that is cute
His whole life he believes that the little hooman will be his next master. So sad. 
That is hilarious
Brave hooman shows good boi that fear is abstract. 
Interesting. The baby is obviously already smarter than the grown up dog. Funny how dogs intelligence really do stop after a certain level while the baby will keep getting smarter 
toddlers are the absolute best
That is adorable!
Cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
That's awesome needed that today
What a smart lil boy. Very cool. 
"You've done quite enough, I'll take it from here"
Thank you for your service dad
Pure love,pure friendship ...magic!

I LOVE THIS!!!! my dog is so terrified of sprinklers and its 110+ out so they are his best friend, I just wish he'd realize it!
Both are amazing 
OLDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
That‚Äôs adorable!
"No, silly human pup...*kiss*...like THIS!"
"I'll take it from here, boyyo."
So nice
Omg this warmed my heart. <3
Baby: "it safe"

Dog: "this is for you"
Wicked cute 
The dog was like "I will trust you human"
I love how the dog walks up to him and shows him love. What an awesome dog.
That‚Äôs beautiful.
So cute
Be careful because someone on one of the GSD sites I belong to let their dog do the same thing and they had to rush it to the vet to have surgery for bloat.üò¢
My German Shepherd probably would've turned around lol
Christ my German Shepard goes nuts for those things
Id love to see a 100 percent toddler trained dog.
This is way tooooooooo adorable 
I don't know brother but if you say so...., F' it I'll fight for you!
This kid will go places in life.  
My dog doesn't even know what to do with my niece. he just bails and she chases him around the house laughing her head off. 
I meant it as a thank you for the people who took care of me when I was younger and I wasn't mentally/physically strong enough to defend myself or be comfortable alone. 
&nbsp;

A positive word said in passing could be meaningless to some but could mean the world to a random weird fat kid having a shit time. 
&nbsp;

More of an appreciation and thank you to everyone who helped me grow into the person I am today, please take care of yourself mentally & physically instead of others all the time kind of vibe. Remember to be kind to yourself too!

&nbsp;

**Edit:** I wasn't saying that I was great or anything I have an extremely long way to go and I'm aware of it. I'm saying I'm happy with my progress and was showing appreciation for the positivity.
&nbsp;

I don't understand how some people can twist things around so much. I'm not sure if people are self-describing their own intentions or what, since it seems like some people automatically assume they know what I'm thinking yet how would that be possible? (What number am I thinking of?) 
&nbsp;

I still have a long way to go and grow but tbh this is just crazy. I don't remember giving you guys shit for being happy with progress no matter how big or small. 









To the top. 
I'm hoping that in eighteen years that now adult little guy will post on r/aww with a picture of the two of them still together.
baby uses hand....dog uses face.  dog is probably like, okay now you use your face....come on now baby, face in the sprinkler.  No?   ....fine.

Funny how it seems like babies and animals have hidden languages/relationships.
I love this.
German Shepherds are really great with kids. 
That's so cute. 
That‚Äôs so amazing 
There is just something to heart warming like the special bond between dog and child. <3
Soldier, toddler, pupper. The r/aww trifecta. 
This is so sweet.

Is it just me, or does that kid seem to have good motor skills for his age?

Seems like the dog already knew how to play with the sprinkler and the toddler was encouraging him to do it again. The pup hanging back and then giving the kid a lick before jumping in is awfully sweet though.
Damn cute üòä
Kiss
What a good friend!
I need the audio for this....anyone?

I want to know what the man is saying
Alright, I'm gonna kill it for you 
"I shall save you from the horrid water snake of wet doom!"

I don't get why cats get the reputation kg hating water. Many dogs hate it just as much, especially in shower form. 
Oh this is So Adorable!
Dog gives a kiss as if it says... "that's cute buddy, now bite it like this" 
Can someone ask me how that toddler knows how a sprinkler is harmless?!?! He is too smart GET RID OF IT!!!!
Your dog intelligence is nothing to my human intelligence. 
Children around that age are so wonderful. I get nostalgic and sad when I see toddlers and my kids are only 14 and 11.
Enjoy your karma
GSD are the best...this is a sweet video
Lololol the lick 
just a word of warning. Our german shepherd died because she was chomping a water hose like this. She started coughing all the time and the vet couldn't do anything :(

As a dog owner, you should never combine water games and dogs with kids around. even nice dogs, they will close their eyes at some point and just bite the air randomly and pull hard on whatever they catch. If that's a kid he will suffer a lot!   
There a lot of stories of kind dogs who just bite kids while playing water games.
Awww
"You'll shoot your eye out with that "
