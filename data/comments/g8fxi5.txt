Hey wait a minute. This isn’t the living room.
Did you just start taking him out when he was a baby to get him used to it?
I need to know - how did you get him to remain so calm outside - and wear a life vest...for science.
Your cat is living my best life
Gary?!
[deleted]
Jesus. He’s perfect.
Try taking him on a night adventure sometime.  Most cats sleep a lot naturally during the day, so he might be less likely to nap at night.  Either way, though, I'm sure he'll still be adorable.
I would love to see more of you and your cat's adventures. Several hours more in fact.
Never seen a cat in a life jacket before
How did I get here?
What did you film that with?!
Where the f- 


Oh yeah, this again.
He’s like ‘de fuck we doin’ ‘ere’
I got mad and about to yell that that’s Gary the cat, not yours. Then I learned you have another account. I love Gary
the cat wakes up and asks: where did you brought us? human: to a Big River.
Cat: YOU WHAT!?
Gary! Such a awesome floof
He must trust your judgement so much. This is wonderful.
The trust factor.
Aww Gary!
u/vredditdownloader
He is too precious!
I need more content like this ASAP
Majestic one is he.
You sound just like my parents all through my teen years. lol
The clarity of this, the natural beauty of the surroundings, and an awesome cat to boot - great OC!
I'D WATCH 3 HOURS OF THIS, PLEASE MORE FOOTAGE OP!!
Cat: *Wakes up* “Where are we human?, where is my bed? Also, why can’t I smell food?

Human: “Were on a boat right now”

Cat: **A WHAT!**
I don't think he is sleeping more like when you are sunbathing on the beach and just relax and close your eyes enjoying the sound waves and the smell of the salt of the ocean.
Wow, the video quality is amazing! What are you using to film?
i would die for Gary
GREAT GRAMS OF GARY!!!! one of my fav insta cats 🥰
They do need 16 hours of sleep every day.
My wife and I are outdoor adventure photographers and have the laziest most fear filled cats you can imagine. I would love to take them on some of our longer paddling trips. When I mentioned this to my wife she clearly reminded me of the time I tried to put one outside on the grass and he freaked out and wouldn’t come near me for a week.

The whole point of this story, your cat rocks.
Put one of those vests on a friends car once. The little thing always wanted to have it on for the longest time. We’d always see it cozed up somewhere with his face like this cat in the clip
damn ungrateful children. just kidding. he's a spoiled boy and should be!
Should have made that trip at 3 a.m.
Bold of you to take a cat on an inflatable kayak
“Where the fuck are we now, Aaron?”
IS THAT GARY????? On a different sub??? I’m so happy
Aren't you scared of his claws on an inflatable boat?
Gary!!
Good kitty.
A cat in an inflatable craft? Bold move sir!
Resembles an aunt of mine. Went on a cruise to an island for a day trip, and then stayed on the ship and slept while the others enjoyed on the island.
He's trying his best
Hey it’s Gary! I love seeing his posts all the time
It’s Gary!
Gazza must be the chillest cat in the world
Do you call them catventures?
The video looks great, what device are you using?
Well, guess I’ll be talking to my husband about getting a cat leash.
Gary!!

I follow this big floof on IG and he seriously makes my day. I even show off new posts of him at work and all my co-workers (even the cat-hating ones) love him. Thanks for all the photo/video updates!
I wish my cat would sleep through something.  

Just like... one thing.
Gary!! Gary wake up!!!
Hey, is this Gary?
Is that a inflatable kayak with a cat with nails on top of it.
If you gave me a wearable pillow i’d fall asleep everywhere too
Gary!
That's cool. so content.
Yay, it's Gary!
i checked out /r/Gary_The_Cat, and i see you use that same rope pictured for your regular cat leash. Why?
Kitty is having a great time.
Cat:

Please let this be a dream. Please let this be a dream.  Am I still asleep?  It IS dream! I'm not about to die.  Must stay asleep to save myself.

Human:

He sleeps through all his adventures!
You're playing a dangerous game there, putting his claws on the inflatable boat thingy
You can tell that cat has a big personality
Peace-peace situation
That cats life is pure bliss
That's AWESOME!

Have a wonderful Sunday :-)
Just wanna let you know that Gary has been my phone lock screen for months now. He’s so cute 🥺
This isn’t your video this person has their own Reddit page called Gary the cat unless you are using your human account 🤣

Edit: peeped at your page. You good! 😂
Probably dipped its tail in the water while getting in the canoe!
Wait a minute cat vs rubber tube
What kind of camera is this, it’s great
Cool cat
I just lost it at the sight of that life jacket on him
He looks so peaceful
Why is this so cute!
I love cat smooshes.
Brave taking a cat in the water in an inflatable kayak
Must be nice to have an adventerous cat. I took my cat on the back deck once and it did not go well. Lets just say he grappled on me so tight he was basically glued to me
why am i crying over this your cat is so cute
That looks so freaking relaxing I don’t blame him for sleeping 😎
Enjoying life.
Shhhhh the floofball is sleeping
Might just be relaxing.
Hi Gary and Gary's human.
GARY! I am so happy to see you on the front page!
If I had gentle waves to listen to I would be deep too
Just goes to show how comfortable Gary is on your adventures!
You know what’s better then going on tiring adventures? Sleeping on an adventure
He's fulfilling his lifelong dream of napping all across the world and you're helping.
Someone's gotta say it - your cat is spoiled.
He's enjoying them nonetheless
Holy BhatMan...  

This kitty has a ton of followers...  How have I never seen this cool cat before?!?!?
So relaxing to watch
Hey Gary!
The way it looks around to take in the scenery..
Awe and his little life vest!
Gary!!!
Gary is so chill!
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen in my life
I want to be this cat.
In the beginning he kinda looked like a hamster, still too cute
My cat would freak the fuck out jump off the boat and drown
Hey, you. You’re finally awake.
I would be terrified of Hawkes
They sleep 18 hours a day or something. What did you expect?
Start rocking the boat
This is funny, because when I was learning to sail, I felt strangely and abnormally sleepy, then I found out that it was a sign of seasickness.
Lmao nap time , looks comfy
What’s this? Where on earth am I? What am I doing here?
Its taking a CatNap! Many cats nap after adventures, stress or in very comfortable settings. You are doing it right! You both love being on Adventures
My indoor cat would hate everything about this. She’d be terrified of the water, she’d be scared of the sunlight, and she’d think the life jacket were a snake trying to strangle her.

I’m gonna try this on her next week.
Lucky cat, I bet he has great dreams ;)
Ohh, he's so precious. Just give him a big hug and enjoy that you have him.
This cat has a better life than most of us 😂😂😭😭😭😭😭😭
He is a gorgeous cat! So cute!
Sweet baby 💗
I freaking love this. I want an Adventure Cat!
Surroundet by water, I think shes just waiting for the bad end.
Ah this place again, I came here on my 2nd life
Kayaking Kitty...🥰
"Did I leave the oven on?"
Aww your cat is so cute!
This is truly excellent. Thank you so much for posting.
He looks so comfy and he trusts your company that's why he can sleep peacefully.
I am just a cat
I sailed through the sea
On the boat I sat
Alas in my sleep, I couldn't see
I am the master of zen. Beautiful landscapes and--- holy shit. We're on a BOAT!
Ever take him through some rapids?
Omg stunning! Norwegian Forest Cat?
Where is this? Looks like a great place to hike
such a beautiful fluffy! this place is amazing
When he woke up he was like, “Where the fuck am I?”
Wish my cat was docile. She flips out over any noises and is true to being a 'scaredy cat'
Fuzzy baby!!!
Thats so cool. Looks peaceful.
so much cuteness :-)
 r/airplaneears
That is an awesome cat!
Aren't you afraid he might let his claws out into the rubber boat?
Best nap ever!
Cat: wakes up

Also cat: “Damnit Steve! Not this shit again.”
 Na he just vibin
He's just applying barely amused mastery.
Where have you taken me now?
I needed to see this today.
That is the most content cat I've ever seen on a boat on a lake.
He just want to sleep!
He’s not asleep. He’s zen.
Nice that you gave him a life jacket.
**and he loves to sleep through the tranquility he consumes from them 

Title change
looks like the okanagan
Omg his lil life vest !!
My cats would never be that calm near that much water.
Someone should tell him that I guess
we got the same boat, the two person version for 90 on amazon. sweet to keep in the van for a quick trip :)
I've never owned a cat but I like them and have friends who own one. If I get a cat, I want him to be chill like this one so I can take him places with me
What a cat
pp cloud
u/vredditdownloader
This video is so relaxing to me.
I done told this mf I’m not an outdoor cat. Imma  finna catch a nap.
"let's just order sushi next time, no need to come fetch them fresh"
Cat has it's priorities straight.
Nah dude, your cat is just achieving their goal on sleeping where no cat has slept before.
Such a cat power move.
I have seen your posts on Instagram! They are amazing! Give him extra treats for being such a good kitty! 😻
He needs something a bit more extreme. Try skydiving or the luge.
A man need his rest.
Do not awaken the holy one
I need a YouTube series.
How do you deal with fleas?! I took my cat out for a walk one time and he’s had fleas ever since :(
He wake up and be like where da fuck am I
Super sweet!!! May I ask what phone you took the clip with? The sharpness and colour for (what I assume is) a phone camera is great!
Hi Gary!
He is adorable!!
GAAAARRRYYY
GARY! In the wild! I mean literally, but also outside of his own amazing subreddit
The housecat equivalent to my boyfriend making me watch a movie but I just scroll reddit instead. I'll play along but honestly just let me do my thing okay
you are giving him some amazing naps!
Where've you brought me now you asshat.. this is not warm!
Which breed does he belong to ? You don’t normally see a cat that chilled especially when close to water.
That is how much cats care😂😂😂😍😍😍😍 just be like cat
Like this made my day. Thank you
That's a chill cat
His fur looks so soft, he's a beauty x
Are we there yet~
Gary’s instagram is my favorite IG heheheheheh
“Crap, I must have run out of lives and ended up in heaven somehow”
u/VredditDownloader
"Are we home yet?" - cat
👍🏼 he has the life
hey you. 

your finally awake.
Hey Where's the sofa gone
So fukcing wholesome
Cat: I just had the craziest dream

Owner: You know you’re sailing right
Meanwhile, my cat gets motion sickness and starts puking in the elevator on our way to the condo parking lot.
I have that kayak
Excuse me, I believe you stole my cat!!
You were probably sitting down that entire time, it it not fair for the cat to rest as well? right?
My cat would flip out and end up in the water
He is unimpressed by the beauty of nature.
That is the most cat response.
Always nice to see Gary in hot!
Looks like a pretty content kitty!!
Damn dude where do you live
Where in Canada are you? All of the pictures are so gorgeous I want to visit the area (if/when we’re free to travel again).
Results may vary.
Gary!
Nice
How precious is this cat?!
Me on a damn road trip
This is super cute. But, very curious, how does your cat go to the bathroom? Does t just go outside or hold it in until you’re home?
Great grams of Gary!
So adorable :)
Gentle snooze and OMG WHERE THE HELL AM I!?
I have the same inflatable kayak!
Do you have a backpack or some sort of carrier that you use to take your baby around? My cat loves the outdoors and I want to find a good way to take her around where she comfortable and secure.
Does he have mutton chops??
Gary the adventure cat! 💖💖
The sad realization that a cat is more well traveled than you.

Great cat though
Puss in boats!
intex challenger. great kayaks for so cheap. love them
Just like my wifey.
Is that an inflatable kayak? If so very brave of you to bring a cat a long. But he looks like a good boy so you're probably good. ☺
So we meet again, The Gary...
Take her at night.
I like that he has his own PFD :D I think I have the same inflatable kayak, did you buy it on Amazon?
Do you keep him on a leash or does he follow you normally?
I love Gary!
"Hey you, you're finally awake!"
Can anyone tell me the breed of this cat! I used to have a cat named Harley that looked very similar to this cat. I never got to say goodbye to lil ol Harley.
"Hey you, you're finally awake!"
My heart melted
He is like me on a long car ride. 12 hours later I'm new a new state and saying, "Well that was a fast trip." While my husband glares at me. Lol
He’s just enjoying his own view.
Aww so cute
Gotta keep in mind that cats sleep 15 hours a day on average
u/redditvdownloder
Hey look a birb
That either shows how calm or bored he is
ROFL
This looks so peaceful.
he's just vibing. no need to interrupt :)
He's awake, but he doesn't want to give you the satisfaction.
Fall asleep for one damn minute and you put me on a river!? I'm a cat, Dave!
Did anyone else see the cloud?
I love your life!!! :D
Is this Gary the cat?
If I attempt to put my cat on a boat I will get shreded. Let alone putting the cat on a bot with a lifesaver jacket
Good cat
Wind In His Hair.
sweet
Gary!
Looks like my wife....”about time, you took me out”
The water looks so calm! Where is this?
I love the lifevest, he must love having the headrest for his adventure naps.
That cat must so chill
A beauty! With proper Pfd too boot. Good on ya! My fur ball would never.
The cute and adventure is strong.
Is this Gary the adventure cat?!?
Dont blame him ,he just feels good ang calm i guess that it makes him sleepy
Cat. Daytime= sleep. Nighttime = hunt a bit,  then sleep.
that's me on the motorcycle with my dad when I was a kid
bro he deadass reached the nirvana
"What the Whiskers?"
As long as he doesn't sharpen his claws on that boat

Had a cat just knead a heavy duty air mattress once...
It looks like a good life to me, for both of you! :)
This gives me good but sad memories :(
Gary is just the best.
U/vredditdownloader
There are life vests for cats?
He's Ike.. "If I'm gonna die I'm gonna die. Might as well relax for now"
I mean that cat seems blissed out.
Cat wakes up wondering where he is and how he got there.
Lol that’s what they do cats like to sleep I love cats so much
“How did i end up here? I need to lay off the catnip”
I just watched the Witch’s Flower on Netflix and the main character carries her cat with her everywhere and i thought there’s no way that cat would just stick by her. Then I saw your post, I guess it is possible! Haha
What do you expect?
This kit kats name is Gary and hes easily one of my favorite pages on instagram
What the Whiskers?
I have the same kayak. It was such a good purchase. It’s under $100, easy to transport and quick to inflate.

Intex Challenger if anyone is interested.
Quite the sightseer.
if you're a cat you haven't really been somewhere until you've taken a nap there.
That's his own way of enjoying them!
I see you inflatable kayak! I love mine.
Is he (or has he) any specific breed that is inclined to go along with this amazing adventure or did you luck out by chance?
I want to go fishing with you one day. I promise to give all fish we catch to Gary as tribute to being such a chill af gato!
I love Gary!
That's okay.  Looks like you are enjoying his company ;-)
There’s a good breeze on that floof
I’m not really here, I’m not really here haha
Yeah he could have grabbed it by the dick
This is surely my favorite vid in the world... I revere the life you spend with your cat 🥺😍
Gary!!!
Wise cat
ungrateful little shi-
Can I be your cat?
"Wait...where the fuck are we?"
You're putting a personal pillow around his neck, how do you expect him not to sleep!?
That means he's enjoying them
Is your cat de clawed or something ? That’s gonni pop
So cute ,I hope to have a cat like this🐱🐱🐱
adorable
This is wholesome, I really love how content and relaxed he is, mine would be freaking out hahah
What a good kitty
Gary? Follow him on Instagram it’s worth it for sure
Gary
“Oh! All the places I Slept”
How do his claws not puncture the inflatable?
Hes embracing it
It’s Gary! I follow him on Instagram.
Barely any audio so my brain unconsciously imagined Moog City playing in the background.
That is a penis cloud...
His face is like a pancake at the start of the video. He's SO chilled out. I love him.
Is this Life Of Pi?
if that's a life jacket he's rocking then that is fucking adorable lol
I live vicariously through this cat on IG. Gary has a good life.
This just made my day💜
Pawsome adventures meowndering through nature.
Parent trapping your cat
I bet he still enjoys them, new view every time he wakes up from his nap instead of the same chair or window.
Clearly, nothing impresses him...
“If I close my eyes, the water won’t be there.”
I'd fall asleep too. At least until you rolled the Kayak.
He looks like one of those cats who just like to be near their people.
Amazing animal!
Liar. That cat is not sleeping.
Not all of them are good girls
i must say your photos (and videos ofcourse) are amazing, simply breath taking.
Nightmare for the cats
[deleted]
Hi gary
Cat + water + inflatable whatever that is = brave
Beautiful cat and nice kayak!
 TrtvtVogt dEtc frog D seeed Day its sex’s
Hi Gary :)
That dude is just super content ....... great job giving him the high life :)    How old is he ?
When a cat give you 42k upvotes.
This looks like Central Oregon!
wow nice view
What camera was this taken on!? It’s like 9k 200fps 😱
Is he a Wegie(Nfc)? Cause he looks like one c:
Adventure cat is still cat.
Where is this?
Make it a gif and add a lofi track
How are you able trust that she wont get lost or something? I dont trust like
I love him
Wait is that dick shape cloud????
Hey its Gary!
Must be an adventurous type... Maine coon or?
*Wakes up*

**Where the fuck I am?**
Gary is an amazing cat!
What a good and precious boy! He looks so soft. I would be so scared of my kitty falling overboard! Though I’m sure both he and you know what you’re doing :)
Holy shit! As cute as that cat is, that camera quality looks superb! The ripples in the water look majestic!
❤❤❤
The spirit of a true ships cat
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship%27s_cat
Inflatables and cat stilettos do not seem like a good idea.  Are inflatables claw proof?  Declawed!
let me alone stupid human
Probably cuz you're there, he's so relaxed and peaceful!
To be fair, just vibing in the wilds is a spiritual experience.
Thats me when I'm in the car waiting to arive at my destination.
Been a minute since I’ve seen a cat atop r/all
Hold up Karen... where the f are we? What's going on?
The clouds over it’s head looks like c&b
GARRYYYYY
How do you trust your cat to stay with you and not run off?
Have to take it to napa valley
Zen kitty
❤️
He falls asleep because he knows he is safe with you😂😂
Is that a cat life jacket ?
Your cat is living my dream
Very chilled kitty.
[removed]
That’s the cutest fucking thing I’ve seen in my entire life
Updooting just for the little lifejacket !!
Awww love
Where is this you’re kayaking? It’s beautiful there (the cats cute too lol)
“Not this nonsense again,” the cat said.
u/VredditDownloader
Toooo cute
“How am I supposed to bring you dead animals like this???”
Keep your eyes closed and think "the water isn't real".
That is how she taking adventure
It’s Gary!!!
What an adorable little jerk. Love the life jacket!
Really cute clip, but house cats aren’t diurnal
 Where can I get a life vest for my kitty?
r/vredditdownloader
That look is totally, “Where the hell are we this time?”
“Hey, you. You’re finally awake “
Cute!
I need to see more
Wait a minute, was it you and your cat in La Gomera, Spain some 5 years ago?!
That cloud looks like a penis
I may be completely wrong, but that kinda looks like an island I kayaked by in Acadia, like eagle something, am I in the ballpark
He’s absolutely gorgeous.
and here I thought cats hate new environments
he prefers to stay at home and play human crossing
Cats are not dogs. TDGAF
Soooooooo freaking cute
omg gary!!!!
It don’t go down
I can't stay awake on the water either.
very amazing
What is your great cat’s name please?
Maine?
best vibes comming from this little dude.
He is one of my spirit animal
Hey...Pete? This isn't my bed
That’s the good life
I love a good outside nap.
I’ve got that exact same kayak. Ive put tons of miles on it. Best 79 bucks I’ve ever spent
He’s precious
The life jacket is really cute
When you are done socializing for the day.
Where are you? The view looks beautiful
Do cats naturally know how to swim?
Hi Gary!
"hey you you're finally awake"
That’s what hey do
I love Gary!!!
I love Gary!
/u/vredditdownloader
I want to be this cat.
Hey there Gary
<3 love to you all
Push him in and see how long he sleeps then
What a life. Imagine, every time you close your eyes and open them back up you're like "hm, so this is where I am now. Curious."
"Oh shit where'd this water come from??"
OP, where is this?! It's beautiful.
Makayla is not impressed
Thanks I love it
I want to experience the peace and and serenity he is experiencing rn
Omg this video is everything
Wow, what a cool ass kitty though! My kitty would be shredding everything to pieces trying to escape the adventure!
This is sooooo cute
Ha thats awesome
How do you prevent your cat from running away?
 Cat with needle claws on an inflatable kayak. 😬
Spoiled!!!! But adorable!
GreatGramsOfGary instagram.
I love his little kitty life vest. So safe and so handsome.
Me every time my dad took me on a road trip.
Maybe he is dreaming even bigger ones.
Is that the snake river south of Jackson hole?
that is the MOST relaxed cat I've ever seen!!
Haha his life jacket is adorable
Like a baby
That pristine camera quality tho
Im sorry, but that cloud looks like penis
watching the cat on loop while listening to nujabesXdoom https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WifI7lOUI-o
Good ol’ Gary, always on an adventure, more worldly than I am
Does your cat have instagram?
This reminded me of the cat that rows your boat in monster Hunter ;)
Their post on meowwit: "heres another one of my exotic naps."
Is that Gary???
GARY!!
Where is this beautiful river? It almost looks like the Yellowstone.
OP I saw in a comment you said you trained him to walk with a leash, my question is how? My cats super chill with everything but I try to put a leash on her and it’s like all functions have shut down. I really would like to get her used to it so I could also take her on adventures!
Cat on an inflatable kayak = bold move!!
Nocternal creatures like adventures at night.
This cat gets me.
I would look at you if you went with him on his affairs)))
IT'S r/GARY_THE_CAT !
I haven’t seen a video of Gary the cat in so long! This brightened my day.
I sleep everywhere, man. I sleep everywhere, man
until he wakes & freaks !
I dont think i have ever seen a cat be this indifferent to being surrounded by water.
Either he is a consumate slacker (even by feline standards), or you need to find a better stash for your weed.
Your cat is my spirit animal.
Awhh
What a beautiful cat ❤️.
Its... beautiful.

&#x200B;

Ive looked at this for 4 hours now
I love that he's got a little pillow
Cats sleep 18 hours a day dude. This trip probably sucked. Imagine someone taking you down the river during your sleep time and fucking up your routine
hecking chonker
Awwww!!
Yee haw the Texas Rangers son here just makin sure everything’s ok here yee haw
Gary!! This cat is my idol. We bought a harness for our rag doll who always wants to go outside but she keeps slipping out of it. Any suggestions on a better harness?
Does he have on his own mini life preserver?
Booorring!!
he is a lucky cat, some cats don't even adventure into the bath.
This cat is probably terrified
That is **so** cool!  He's a majestic floof and so calm on the water!
Is that Gary?
Awesome!
Gary made it to the front page!!!!
My favorite kayak!!
he looks so soft
wow sooo much beauty
Wait... what?? Where dafuc am I???
I’m using the same kayak! I really like it!
This is the cutest thing ever
He's just enjoying the napmosphere.
That cat’s living a better life than I am
Is that an inflatable raft
I love how he opens his eyes and looks around like he wasn't expecting to be on the water.
My 2 year old too. He can’t stay awake more than 15 minutes on my kayak or bike. Rocks him right to sleep.
Just like my wife.
That's because it's very relaxing.
Garfield.exe activated
Just take me along next time
Inflatable kayak with a floofball with sharp nails!? How did you manage this!?
I can't get my cat to come into the room with me. How'd you get him on a kayak?
Meanwhile, a bird lands on his head and just chills there...
Where are you in that post? And why am I not there right now?
Maybe because they’re peaceful and calm
So adorable 🥰
He must trust you a lot. Even surrounded by water, he knows you'll keep him safe.
Awww hes so fluffy 🥰
Maisie says, "hi again Gary 😉❤️❤️🦵"



https://imgur.com/gallery/MPTalJh
That cat seems really chill for being on the water.
How did you get your cat used to adventures?
She likes the smell of fish it gives her nice dreams
Seems like he is just enjoying the Trip
Gary?!!
That's the way a cat enjoys an adventure.
I could watch this all day 😌
My spirit animal
KITTY can’t wait to do this with my car. Kayaking is my absolute favorite.
If I learned something from cats . They love tuna and sleeping on the couch.
This is amazing! Also I have the same boat and pet life vest!!
My wife does the same thing
Adorable
u/vredditshare
Gary!
I love Gary.
Aww such a cute floof ❤️
I had that kayak! Dont leave it in direct sunlight for too long or the black air inlet will prolapse.
Cats will be cats
Human: we were totally there the other day. 

Cat: ok, if you say so. Is it nap time yet?
He just needs a blank canvas for his dreams. He is probably chasing mighty rats in that setting the whole time
Pretty sure I follow your insta!
I hate these nightmares....
It’s a catnap, fool!
“Bruh we ain’t in Kansas no more”
This looks like Hangover part 4
We have the same kayak!
Ragdoll ?????  Gorgeous <3
OMG... =‘)
Where is this at damn that’s some nice scenery 👌🏼
Was this filmed on a go pro?
GARY!!!! I love your cat(s?) and dog(s?) I cant remember how many you had but Gary is PERFECT
Lmao he’s just chillin there, has he ever fallen in the water?
Could’ve sworn his eyes were open
he's at peace don't bug him
way too cute!!
Omg this is too precious
Sqwishy face
You need a dog
Dog would not let you down like that.
Living his best life!
*So, you're finally awake.*
I relate 😂

Hey that’s Canmore right!
Thank you! I will look into those. I’m always scared that it’s going to be too tight.... she is just so fluffy it’s hard to tell when it’s the right fit.
Hey it’s me ur cat
I'm jealous of how comfy he looks.
Gary!
I'm surrounded by water probably another nightmare time to go back to dreaming pleasant dreams -Cat (probably)
He’s just happy to be there with you
Gary!!!!! Fancy seeing you here on Reddit! I look forward to your Instagram pics...they always make me smile :) such a good cat
Next time, take me instead. That place looks amazing
1000th comment I need the satisfaction
What a beautiful napping spot though!
I'm guessing that's a 1 life jacket and the rest is up to kitty.
r/garythecat
I’d be nervous if his claws popped the raft....
inflatable cat in a boat with sharp claws.....
Winning!
He's just enjoying them his way my dude
Maybe he doesn't want to be there?
If Zen had a face
He looks identical to my old cat Ace. Miss that fat guy.
Cats are nocturnal.
I took my cat on a canoe too! He was quite young, didn't know to be scared of water yet. I don't know if that would fly now, because I bathe him and he isn't super stoked about it, but he does walk on a leash and plays fetch.
Is this the $60 infaltable kayak on Amazon? I just got home from taking mine out for the first time.
I see we’re not the only ones missing our barbers.
Today is the day I fell in love with Gary.
Your cat looks like a lighter colored version of my cat!
Haha this is too funny!
Or doesn't want to see... dude.
“Huh... where am I? This isn’t the laundry basket... human where did you take me?”
Lucky cat, beautiful adventures!!! ❤️🥇

I think he enjoys it in a relaxing way.
Well no surprises here.....after all, he is a cat.
Lol, me. I used to live on a boat, but apparently my seasickness manifests as sleepiness. So as soon as we left harbor and were on open ocean, I was completely zonked out in my cabin. XD so I don't have a lot of those memories.
Big mood 🥴
What brand is Gary's life jacket?
Is he a Norwegian Forest Cat? He looks like my cat's twin.
