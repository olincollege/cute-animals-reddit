“But I like to play with it?”

Such a sweet momma!
The roly poly at the bottom is my favorite
Dog Mom: Why is no one having a good time? I specifically requested it.
"Something's wrong they won't play fetch" awwww she look's so worried

(Give em time precious)
She looks so sad : /
First time mum? Clearly desperate to make them happy, no idea what they need
"I didnt give birth to yall for yall to not play with me"
I will take the one rolling on her back aww
Adorable pups!
I’m a terrible human being for laughing at her unhappiness.  

“My children reject the ball.  Are they broken?”
I love that. it shows she wants them to be entertained.
That dog looks worried about developmental delays
“do something, you’re the expert!”
Awww so sweet
What’s wrong with my children!?
Those eyes… 😭
Lol this was me trying to get my newborn to play with rattles and other baby toys.
The doggie looks so sad
They look like ^lil ^potatoes
I'm not sure how a person could look at the face of sad dog mom and not go over and pet her. And then of course protocol requires that you pet all the puppies too.
I love the pup that's chillin' on her back!😄😍
All her treasures in one place.
This reminds me of my late mother. She passed a couple months ago. 

A few Christmas’s ago she was in the hospital with kidney failure, she missed Christmas Day but was home a few days later. She still wanted to Christmas shop, so she got us all little things from the gift shop. 

I have a fairly large beard. But for some reason she got me a nice old school shaving kit. I laughed and asked her why… I mean… I obviously have no intention on shaving. 

She just said it was nice, and she wanted me to have it. She was just doing her best. She loved buying gifts, Christmas was her favourite time of year. Unfortunately she just wasn’t able to actually go shopping. 

Love you Mama.
“Why… like, hi?! What’s even…” - Momma who just gave birth with unbelievable doggie expectations
The one pup on their back is my spirit animal
Awe all tuckered out! The little doggo on his back is Sooo cute!!!
Omg the sad look on mommas face. She’s thinking “I knew my kids would eventually hate me and under appreciate the things I bring for them but I thought I had at least a few months….”
Owww her face is.

Is something wrong with my babies?

Im a bad mother?

I wanna hug her so much,poor good girl.
Sooooooo CUTE!!!!!!!

![gif](giphy|M90mJvfWfd5mbUuULX)
Her face!  "Why they no play?  Are they broken?"
Super cute doggo mum but I think she was asking her human to throw it for her!
momma dog face is showing expressions that   
**why no one is playing with ball**
“Are they broken??”
“Am I doing it wrong??”

Bless her sweet worried heart.
That’s exactly how 5 year old me felt when I handed my newborn baby sister a rattle and put it in her hand when she just continued to sleep. Mom told me for nine months that it will be so much fun to have a baby sister to play with and I felt completely lied to.
Who really is the puppy here? She has such a good textbook puppy eyes :'(
All i can see is the pupper rolling over for belly scratches. How can you resist that and keep on filming.
SMOL
Looks to me like Mom wants a fetch break herself. I lived with a fetch-aholic who implored us to throw her Kong hours after she gave birth. “THROW IT!!”
TBH this is me with my new baby. 😂
Appreciate your doggo today while they are still here.   Give them pets and love.   I just lost my girl today. May she rest in peace and know she will always be loved.
Dogs are just plain awesome!
Dog mom has the most loveable face!!
She looks so sad 😭
Idk, the way she's looking at the camera makes me think the person put it in there
2 smol 4 bol
She looks so sad, lol. How cute
That look of concern from the momma, like "doctor tell me what is wrong with my children, dont sugar coat it".
You know you're bored when you ACTUALLY want to play with your kids. 😂
![gif](giphy|1miKtEDuir8wDVWd5F)
cuteness overload
Aww that cheek-puff where she clearly tells her mom/dad how frustrating this is. :-D
She has very expressive eyes for a dog.
She looks all concernicus.
I think she brought it to her human and the kids laid on it ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
The perfect meme for me when I bought my son a nerf gun at three years old. 🤦🏼‍♂️
You pick up that ball and play with her right now
She’s trying and that’s all that matters!!!! SWEET MAMA!!
She looks like a first time mom asking the doctor “Is there something wrong??”
She looks like she's about to cry
Squishy lil puptatoes
She is like:'why dont they bite ball hooman help'
She has such a concerned look on her face , poor mama
Kids these days don’t know what fun is -Mama Dog
She looks so sad/worried.  What a good gorl.
One of our cats recently had kittens and my big boy Worm just can’t wait for them be big enough to play
Sweet !
Ball is life kids
Oh wow.  What a precious family.
She's worried they go to smol jail
I love the one on his back. 💕
"What's *wrong* with them?"
Mom looking at the human like "are you sure they are my pups? They don't even like ball"
The one on its back is chillen 🥰
I demand that someone make that dog happy again, my heart can't take it
why are her eyes *so* sad
Don't worry, momma. Sooner than you'll know you'll be looking at them thinking who the hell thought it was a good idea to give them all balls? I can't get a minutes peace?
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen 😭😭😭
Tell me your a good mom without telling me your a good mom
Her face is asking, “what’s wrong with them..?”
Awww 🥰 don’t worry mama those babies will be running around with the ball very soon!
That one that just rolls over though ...too sweet
Fear not labo, they will get there in time!
I love this ball, so you will love this ball.
But… but why they no play :(
Beautiful.
Awww the sadness in her eyes. How precious!
"Why they no play? Something wrong?"
So cute 💗💗💗💗
What da dog doin'?
I FEEL that little pup laying on her back. She tried to get up but gave up and just accepted her fate. I love her.
She looks so upset her kids are ignoring the ball
She’s so worried about their education, you can see it in her eyes.
Everything that is good and pure in the world is right there in her eyes.
WHY YOU NO PLAY?!?!
[removed]
Smol
I need the directors cut of this film. 3hrs unedited
My 2 year olds do this with my newborns. It's cute.
“Aww … and I thought they’d LOVE it!!!”🥺
She looks so sad about them not playing.
I love how they all got colour collars to tell them apart. It feels so important to tell the puppers apart. Its awful to suddenly lose track. Even before names. Just keeping track feels so essential from day one
She’s such a good mom
She's saying to the human "now do your job and throw the ball for them"
Those eyes !!
Okay, this is adorable but why do I connect with the one that looks drunk?
Her face!  Omg!
She looks so sad . “Are they broken? It’s a BALL. How can they resist a BALL”
I want the one on his back 😍
Those eyes
She seriously doesn’t understand why she just brought them the best thing in the whole world and they are just ignoring it! The look on her face is priceless. 🥰
Her face. "why no fun? I specifically requested it"
Her eyes look so sad & worried 😟 I think she needs cuddles.
The ball is mommy now.
What breed??
Ow my heart!
Look at that face. I'm in love!
...Is it a golden or a lab? I'm so confused.
These always make my day. You are a treasure
They are so new they don’t even know how life works yet
She looks so sad im going to cry
So cute!  simple pleasures.  Unconditional love:)
Her face says “Are they broken?”
Aww that look she is giving. "Human, why they no play?"
I’m a cat person but this mom & pup litter could convert me. She’s so forlorn like won’t someone play with me.
And this exactly why I’m a dog person 🥺
Not mad, disappointed.
I will play with you momma pup ;_;
I want want to cheer her UP!!!  xoxo ♥️♥️♥️
It looks like she wants to cuddle with them
This is giving me diabetes.
that dog looks like a straight up disney character. her eyes are huge
her face- pure disappointment. every mother knows THIS feeling…. 🙄🤣🤣🤣🤣🤦🏾‍♀️
*”Are they broken?”*
The one puppy just wants belly rubbing and no one is obliging
The one laying on his back got me a new type of happiness
She looks so concerned that they don't want to play
Aww mamas face is like are they broke??
The intent behind mama dog’s eyes is absolutely amazing.
Awww 🥰 so cute
I love everything about this.
She looks so concerned.
I've never seen a dog with a more concerned face than this.
literally 🥺 face
In about two weeks, she will miss all this free time.
Mom looks so worried that they aren't playing:(
What.  A.  Face!!
Her face! She is so sweet.
Seems like a sweet dog.
Those eyes though
Her look is literally 🥺🥺🥺. My heart 😭😭😭
>Wha- What do I do? Human mother, they... they don't like ball. What do I do?
"hooman, halp, they don't understand!"
“there’s something wrong with my kids. they’re not having fun.”
Lol she looks so worried
*lookitdawittlefatbabies*

Why am I like this
Lol, that one pup “ no ball, just belly rubs please!”
What breed of dog is it?
She did her best.
This is Def the cutest thing I've seen in a while
Love her expression.  She’s so filled with expectation for them.
That pup vibin’ on its back 😂
holy shit those eyes
Can I please have the “I’m just chillin on my back cuz” pup? PLEASE! 😍
Clearly a first time mom, doesn’t know what to do, doesn’t know what they need.
Why does she look so sad?  Is she just tired?
When dogs look like that are they sad
Too smol for bol
She looks so sad :'(
Omfg those brows! Someone please play with her! 😭😭😭
those are some of the best puppy eyes i’ve seen
When the momma can't even handle the cuteness of her puppies.
If you can relate to the puppy lying flat on it's back, you are a certified lazy person
Dogs are so precious ☺️
So cute
Aww so cute
Is they broken?, answer me,human
how beautiful I love dogs, that upturned puppy is very cute
Kawaii!
So cute, what breed is she?
What a beautiful dog.

Those eyes are killing me
Amazing mon and cute puppies
"Here Kids, enjoy my favorite ball in the world"

...

"linda wtf is wrong with them?"
She’s so fkng cute I’m dying omg her face
🙈🙈🙈
If ball is too big for your mouth, it’s not your ball.
aww I want one so bad
Make sure to make some noise around them so they won't get scared of them when there older like some balloon's, a bell and maybe a old school timer that will rattle
Why is nobody having a good time? I specifically requested it!
The camera is on, and you will appear to have fun.
The way her eyebrows are, they make her look so worried.
Adorable mama
She looks so sad that her pups aren't ecstatic to play with it.
my heart melts
Stupid small kids
She looks so... worried? Concerned?
Awww those little puppers :,)
The cute baby laying on its back!!!
I'm in, sweet momma
"OK guy's... are you going to use the the ball? If not I'll take it back if you don't want it...

Mom wtf do I do with them??"
It's too sweet!!!
I’ve seen those eyes before. That dog is exhausted.
So cute ☺️
*so smol
Teach em young.
So cute she’s like what’s wrong with them why don’t they play with the magic toy  :-(
What breed is that? 😍
My heart... it's... melting.
Those are some happy well fed little pups. What an amazing momma
That one with full belly exposure is my favorite. “Is this what you want me to do mom?”
I want the lazy one laying on its back.
The genuine look of concern on momma dog's face kills me.
Those eyes, my heart.
Her look says it all: "Okay doc, give me the truth. Something's wrong with them, right? They should be playing; god why aren't the playing? TELL MY WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM!!! MY CHILDREN ARE HANDICAPPED!"
Awww I wanna cry. So precious.
oh my god

I think I've seen everything I need to see in life
Upside down potato pup ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
She’s a sweet mom.
I would pet her and tell her don’t worry your kids will be having fun soon enough.
*That's so adorable!* Momma is beautiful and the look she is giving you,  like help me hooman show them how to play. And the little one with the purple collar is cracking me up.  It's like he is trying to rock himself back and forth to gain momentum to roll over, but his little sibling is stopping that!
OH I LOVE THEM THEY ARE FLUFFY
Does anyone else feel like that puppy stuck on its back?
Such beautiful pups. And the one laying upside down 🥰😍
She did her most important job, they are well fed and loved!
Mom comes home from work to a house full of teens …😆
It is the size of their heads!
She brought it for YOU to play with. She’s like “hey their cute and all, but you’re forgetting the Queen here”
Ball is life
❤️🥰
Look how cute they are! Aww!
It’s like when your baby is asleep and you want them to wake up

I love her face! She looks so worried! What a sweet doggo!
The puppy with his tummy out passed the vibe check
Looks to me like they are all more interested in taking a nap.
Momma looks so sad they dont react.
Cuteness overload
"Whats wrong with them?! It's a BALL!"
Every parent has this moment at some point. 

For me it was the realization that my 6month old can’t play Xbox.
All I love how one shows momma their belleh!
These are my pups

I give them my ball

But they will not take

I think they too small


Why they so cute

But still will not play?

I do a sad

But I love, anyway
“Why aren’t they playing? 🥺”
Potato farm
She seems a bit disappointed!
Her eyebrows! 💕
That is the sweetest ever .
I woke up thinking I had everything I wanted. Then opened Reddit and realized I was living a lie.
Her eyes🥺
"They no play wif ballo? Oh no, they're retrieveded aren't they?"
Awwe….❤️
How freaking cute!!
Awww, the face!
Why does she look so sad?

Mummy’s like why no play with ball?
Omg. 600 awards!
My heart!!!

The eyes
She looks tired
Her confusion is visible
She looks so sad, poor momma
I imagine the collars are for identifying who's who.
The dogs face looks like this -> 🥺
She looks as if she need your help cause she is out of her depth
Hooman, please fix!
This is too cute stop it I’ll take them all.
Omg look at her face, she is so sad they are not playing with the ball

As cute as the puppies are, that mom is *gorgeous*. I'm literally mesmerized! So adorable...
Squishy lil puptatoes
Hopefully they weren't bred to be sold and are oopsiebabies (spay or neuter your companions!)
Why she look so sad
Mommy doggy is like "I work so hard for this family to provide and y'all don't even appreciate it."
We don’t deserve dogs
[deleted]
aww she looks so sad =(
What a bitch
I want a momma dog so badly, but I just can't without the space to keep the whole litter.
The distraught look on mama doggo's face is upsetting me
She looks distraught
Her sad eyes almost make me want to cry…
Dis ball.  Get to know it.  Feel it in your chompers. If hummam bemming throw, you get.  

This is the way.
People tell me dogs dont smile and don't look sad..

Who can look at this dog and not understand the idea of sorrow/worry?

Too many sociopaths on reddit.
PET. THE. FRIGGIN. DAAAAAAAAWG!

You make them sad eyes disappear this instant, owner person!

In all seriousness, what an unbelievably sweet baby, who now herself has precious lumpy fuzzball babies of her own! Congrats!
I feel like the person recording this is the one who dropped the ball there on purpose, the dogs eyes give it away.
Too smol for boll
Somebody play with mama. Soft toss. Come on!
What kind of monster would post this clip without the audio?  
https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingMoms/comments/orefsb/mom\_wants\_to\_play\_with\_her\_babies/
I love you momma!!! 🥰😭🥰
I think she's thinking "human do something, I gave them everything I love the most, my little ball, why don't they want to play?"
Sho shmol!
*These eyes….doo doo*

*Cry every night….for youuu*
Rocket League but its with dogs instead of cars, Doggo League
Lol, the one kid waiting for his belly rub.
She looks so sad! She’s going great!
Awwwww. Poor little momma just wants to play with her cute babies. Too sweet. 😊
She looks so worried❗️😳
[removed]
She brought the ball so she could be allowed to go over to her pups… sad when owners don’t understand their pets cues
This is one of my favourite videosemote:free\_emotes\_pack:heart\_eyes
*useless*
Why does the entire family look depressed.
Hot take: SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR ANIMALS
Dumb
Had a dog like her, my dogs name was Lexi she was really sweet and the best friend I had for a long time (I was around 5 at the time) and I had been snuggling her and fell asleep on her when I woke up she wasn’t alive, probably one of the worst days I have ever had.
Mama’s got bags under her eyes already
This is my dog, if he was a girl and a mom, he’d have been teaching fetch from the womb
They are so schmol
Very rare correct usage of "dog mom"
Dog Mom : I think the puppies are broken.
She looks perplexed ❤️
She looks so concerned about their development! No worries, momma dog, they'll get there in time.
The purple collar upside down one is my favourite
This is so cute
This isn't even the first time this has been posted in this sub with the same title...
lol that one puppy that tried to get up but its belly wouldnt let it :D
She looks so concerned thatbthey aren't playing with the ball.
Oh those eyes look like they are asking why don’t they want it?
Omg her face is full of concern
Dog mom:  Stop looking at my kids and throw the ball for me.
She looks like, “Are my babies broken?”
Ah the anguish
She is absolutely gorgeous.
Dog version of mom addicted to phone games.
With those eyes looking at me... I would just play with the ball to see the dog cheer up !
The ball is too big for their mouth. It is not their ball.
💗💗💗💗
Mama is sad.
"Why are the not playing human?!" Shes so sad
I remember seeing this video. The owner in there has such a sweet voice and is saying something along the lines of, "they can't play just yet (dogs name) they're too small. Give em some time then you can play, okay?" Sweetest thing ever.
Mom dog sure is pretty.
So smol…
so cute
That one pup trying, then giving up rolling over is too adorable!
Her eyes say, "help me this is my first litter and I have no idea what I'm doing."  

Reminds me of when my sister tried to have me babysit my niece and I was like, "uh, does she need a booster seat or something to ride in the convertible? Because it doesn't have a back seat."
I love dogs
So cute!
Awwws. It's a sleep-inducing magic ball.
Little 🥔 s with legs.
What more do they want from me?
Purple collar pupper the best. Just chilling there
Love the one guy chillin on his back.
When I was your age, I walked myself.
Haha that one stuck on his back 🤣
same. For the first 5 years I was like "why do you not like thrifting? are you not one of me?"
Those eyes 👀
The equivalent of having a baby while still in high school
So cute
Her eyes are like: What is wrong with them? Are they stupid?
Those eyes looked so sad.
They must’ve already played. They’re exhausted!
there’s so much love in her face! 🥲
she’s so concerned 😭😭💖
Cute doggies!
She probably wants them to throw it for her
mama looks so disappointed and my heart is not taking this well
Aww, she looks so disconsolate. Poor doggo
*Introduce c’mon do something meme*
ok purple collar is too cute lmao
Mommas a happy doggie.  Sooo cute
🥰
My puppies are broken
I would love the one laying on his back, he seems cuddly. =\]
I felt the same way when I gave my newborn a PlayStation
She looks so sad.  "OMG, I've FAILED as a parent!"
![gif](giphy|HUSRzh2JjK7nO)

My cold and lifeless heart hurts
Omg are they sweet as a german i have a big heart ❤️ for pets thx for sharing something so awesome.
Adorable!!!!!!
She looks so concerned
so cute, especially when the mom looks towards the camera wondering why no ones playing with the ball
That look of parental disappointment.  It can even be observed cross species 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Don’t you mean smol?
Dey so cute!
![gif](giphy|BEob5qwFkSJ7G)
Oh my god, she looks exactly like my dog.
That face pulled the tears out from the bottom of my heart all the way to front of my face. I feel like a new person.
OMG this is literally the cutest thing I’ve ever seen❤️
So desperate looking :(
Mom looks so worried.
That’s like my dad buying my brother and I Nintendo when we were 2 and 3. Lol
Why is mom so sad 😔
Thanks!
Is this the Puppy bowl???
Wow
“They don’t like it… are they broken?”
She’s trying the best she can. It’s like when my mom bought me an NES but the only game she got was TOP GUN
Awwww her sad eyes
Awww she looks so disappointed.
They won't throw it back to me. Why? 🥺
Cute
Aww her face. She's like "am I even gonna be any good at this?"
That chonk on the end can't even sit up let alone play!
I feel like this sweet dog mom could use a pep talk:  you are doing great!  Look at all of those sweet little babies!  They have their mama’s good looks!
"They won't play with the ball!  Is there something wrong with them?  There's something wrong with them isn't there?  I knew it! :( :("
Moms need a break too!
Awwww, Mama jus’ wanna have some fun
The mom looks so concerned
The one on their back is my pick! What a derp!
That's my Black Lab when I take a nap on the couch.
Purple is living the life.
Lol
🥺🥺🥺🥺
Awe what a sin she looks so sad 🥺
Or maybe the person was paying too much attention to the puppies and so the dog put the ball where the human was looking in an attempt to play with the human!
Up back
To be fair, dad bought the baseball glove first
They're not small. They're smol
What kind of dogs are these? Yellow labs?
They are all sleepy
Not much going on other than what looks like a dog wanting treats and some puppies sleeping.
She's like I pooped you out of me now play with meee
"are they defective?"
They are kinda only balls themselves right now...
Pet that dog.
Then she’s lookin for her cut
Its ok mommy... they just lazy and want belly rubs and milkies instead🥰🥺

dont worry dogs....ILL come play with you!!!!!
I can’t deal with those eyes. 🥺
They are BEAUTIFUL
I like the one that's just chilling out on it's back
Me when my friends don't like a movie I recommended.
Don’t worry Dog Mom, they will grow into it. They just need some time.
Labs have very expressive eyes.  They are great at doing the sad puppy face.
I love how the dog mom maintained eye contact until the owner looked back at the puppies
What a sweet mom.
u/profanitycounter
awww beba! that disappointed face, I'm melting
You gib me ball, and I happy!
I gib Dem ball, and... Nothing.
What I do wrong, mom?
She’s wondering what the point of having puppies is if they can’t play.  Patience Mum, patience.
WHERE IS SCHNOODLE
I wanna watch 300 hours of that dog and her pups
Momma needs a hug
The look of the mother dog.

"Bitch, i need help here!"
The look of concern on her face…I just can’t… 🥲
I love the one lying on her back with her paws in the air.
ignorance is bliss
“They came out broken!”
"If your ball is too big for your mouth, it's not yours."

"That's a good wisdom."
They will learn to love the bol
Some people go crazy when you attribute human emotions to dogs. Her eyes are definitely conveying an emotion here.
She’s like every parent “wtf am I doing wrong?”
Please, pet mom NOW
The dog mum looks very concerned by the camera/brouhaha.
Aw, poor momma. Her little potatoes can’t even roll over yet but she wants to play with them.
Omg! Cuteness overload
Aaw+ My parents just lost the family pet last week and my mom is devastated. I shared this with her to get her out of sadness and she literally went “Aww!” Stay lovely r/Aww sub
She looks soooo concerned too.

“Human. Human, I think they’re broken. What do?”
Dog mom: Oh my god! My children are morons!
They just want to snuggle and sleep ma-ma!
They ❤️ to play with balls.. and they r so cute...😘.
She looks so worried! What a doll!
Dog mom: There's something gravely wrong with my children, they don't want the ball
“Why did I have these if they won’t even play with me?”
The puppers on her back😍
The one laying on his back is simply living it up
That one that's just rolling around showing his belly lol
You ever see something so cute you wanna run your head through a wall?
So smol and lazy
Aww she looks sad
Honestly it looks like she wants you to throw it for her...
Dog mom?
Bitch, just saying.
What breed of potato are those

She looks so sad it’s killing me someone pet those dogs
Why did you drop my ball on my babies?
This is so cute 😍
“These new friends are so boring!”
-Mom probably
That look on her face!!  With her gulp at the end

" I have failed as a mother " 😟
Doesn’t Mom have a sweet face?

I’ve never seen such a look of consternation on an animal.

Dog mom: “oh no what if they don’t like the same things I do :/“
What kinda good girl is that doggo? Looks like my sweet lab.
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💜💜i'm dead
I’m in love with the one with the purple caller
Dogs are the best animal.
Aww. She's so worried that she's doing it right. Such a sweet girl. I have 2 dogs. One like this mumma, wanting to do the right thing. The other one? Meh, I know you love me anyway.
Came here for the comments…

Well, next time.
“Please help. What is wrong with them”
My puppers don’t want to play with ball

They are clearly broken
Dog mom: I think my kids are broken.
I’m currently crying in German.
Soon, mama, soon
The sweetest face!
One of the moms I fostered took toys away from the puppies because she wanted to play with the toys
I love how you wrote “kids” and not “puppies” lol
They’re so little! I just wanna play with them
She looks so concerned that they aren’t playing with it 🥺
Has anyone here ever kept a litter/dog family together for their whole lives? What was it like?

(I know it’s not financially feasible due to the fact that you’d have like 10 dogs but having a mini dog family army would be so dope).
She looks so concerned that they aren't playing with the ball. 😂
Welcome mom dog to never being able to do right by your kids (according to them) no matter how hard you try
She wants to get in the pin with them.
“Where did I go wrong?”
Omg…so smol!!!
Her eyes are so innocent and sweet I’m melting
Momma looks sad
This is actually kinda sad, I feel like the dog mom wants to play with her people after they have undoubtedly and of course given so much attention to her pups
it's sad to think shes probably thinking that something is wrong with them because they're not playing with it that's why she keeps looking up at her human :( but knowing she'll understand soon makes me feel a little better
"But...but when play?"
So loving
Omg mom dog’s eyes ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
This is what happens when kids have kids
Oh you KNOW /u/schnoodledoodledo is going to make this melt our heart's.
Omg, that face is precious
Cute puppies
What a good dog mommy!
She looks so sad that they can’t play!
Awwwwwww you are a good mama
She looks like an overtired mom
_’¿hooman y they no play?’_
"You guys suck at this game"
Momma gets whatever she wants ..just look at those eyes 😘
God such dumb animals. They can’t play, have no jobs, no direction in life. Makes me pissed
I know that look that she’s giving. It’s the “something is broken, ples fix it” look. Momma and babies are all adorable!
or rather: "why did you put that thing in there? YOU! I'm looking at you!"
"They don't know how to use a ball! What's wrong with my kids?"
How can they all be so dumb?
Kinda of like the dad bought a Sony Play Station for his 6 month old bebe?
I’m the one falling asleep
The dog mom's looking at the camera like. Owner I think my children are broken
You do everything in your power to make that dog happy RIGHT GODDAMNED NOW!
uh
That one poor pupper seems to be stuck on his back… keeps wanting to roll but can’t figure out how to do so with being surrounded. Too cute. Hope he’s not claustrophobic like me
Everyone loved that
Awwww
Just go and pet them. She's looking so anxiously.
Awwwww! So sweet. Is that her favorite toy?
Ridgeback!
So smol 🥺 nice gesture tho mama!
Sweet Jesus are you serious? *mentally adopts another dog*
"Okay lady, listen, you are not supposed to do puppy eyes, **they** are."

"Plz help they are dumb :("
The pups look tired.
Aww, sweet mama. As others have said, she looks let down because they're not playing with the ball.
She does not understand why the children do not appreciate her gift

I see videos like this and I think "maybe the worlds not so bad after all"
That is absolute wholesomeness.
So disappointed.
"Are these things broken? They *must* be broken..."
Worry Dog
That face😆 -maybe my puppies are broken"
She looks so upset "Ohh, my kids don't like playing ball!"
They are so ^smol
Her eyes ❤️
Oh my God! the pup rolled over. the belly rubs!! The cuteness is strong with these pups.
A blessing from the lord!
“Mommy what are you doing? I’m still a ball myself”
So cuteee 🥺🥰
She is just a teenage mom..
In the video with the audio, the owner said "mom is thinking what's the point of having kids if they won't play with me?"
No she brought it to play whit you idiot :/
This time they are lazy... they will hold party in night... dontworry mom....
When you show up at 2am for the party that started at 6pm.
I like how she lookes worryingly at the camera like "am I doing this right? It's my first time being a mother, I don't really know! What if they don't even like the ball? Oh god is it because it's green?!"


Meanwhile lil puppy's like ***"teehee me me flopy boi***
That poor doggie looks so sad
The disappointment is genuine..hooman do something..
Mom is so much worried. 

Mom please don't worry. 

We will play another time. This time is for sleeping.
Mooommom, that's like tha hole *world.*
Why do mamas look so sad around their pups in these videos?  Probably not the first litter and at some point the puppies go to other homes… breaks my heart.
Is this your dog? This looks exactly like my dog who I adopted around this age.
Awwww that sad look. She must be thinking that the puppies doesn’t like the ball she brought them. Or that they don’t want to play with her. Precious
I have this overwhelming urge to pick up one of her puppies and rub its cute tummy.
Awww so adorable
I want to hug that mama dog!!! What a sweetheart.
Ohhhh my gawwwwdddd😭😭😭!!
She brought the ball for the person holding the camera to throw it.
She’s like “throw it for them!”.  Best mama ever.
She looks so sad that they won’t play with it. She needs a hug so bad.
The mother looks terrified and its horribly off putting
But … i hurted my coochie so bad for that…
No she didn’t… the ball was already sitting in their pen when the video started

This would be my Pipers if she was still able to have pups and had pups. Loves playing fetch and catch with a ball. I told my girlfriend before we got her spaded that we shouldn’t. This brings those feelings up all over again. My poor Pipes
Mom looks so sweet. I love dogs so much. We don’t deserve such devotion.
That one puppy looking at the camera
“Are my babies….*sigh* dumb?”
She looks worried. “They aren’t playing with it. Are my babies…. Dumb?!?!”
Let's be honest, she just wanted to play
I think they are sleeping and SHE wants to play fetch.
“They don’t play ball? Where did I go wrong??”
there is always a derpy one
“What’s wrong with them?”
leaked footage of what da dog doin?
The very first frame of this is adorable.
The  baby lying on his back so cute the way he looks at the camera at the end is hilarious.
that 4th puppy is enjoying his life..
We don't deserve dogs. They are the best.
What's the name/breed of this lovable dog?

I've seen this before even SchnoodleDoodleDo( I'm sorry if the name isn't correct) wrote a few verses on this
She looks so sad
They only want to eat and sleep

She looks so concerned
She looks so worried.
Oh my god she looks like she's about to cry 😢 so precious

Puppy's expression of ignorance ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)

That look says it all. She’s disappointed in her children.
