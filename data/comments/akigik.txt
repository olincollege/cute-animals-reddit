Oh my... that face. Such a good boy
That's a good spot! Got room in there for one more?
The dog is like: Watcha looking at? 
The video quality is incredible 
Oh hai Mark
My last pup molly loved a cubby she had a few around the garden rip 
Made myself a lil room.
Hey mtv welcome to my crib
Give me some space Karen

It's a labrador dontretrievemeer!
That innocent look 😩😍
He's got that precious little smile when you found him <3

Can we all agree this camera work was immaculate 
That is one eminently boopable snoot.

This video is satisfying 
This made me nostalgic, reminding me of being a child and having secret spots like this around my parent’s or grandparent’s properties. I spent so much time outdoors adventuring around.
Not to worry you, but sometimes dogs hide in a spot like that when they’re sick or sense something wrong with them. Might be worth checking him/her over carefully for lumps and get a physical and bloods with the vet.

I’m sure he’s just being a cute weirdo but I only learned about this behaviour when it was too late for our boy who was doing the same. 
He just needs some time alone. He’s just going through some stuff right now. You wouldn’t understand.
that frame rate tho 🤤
This might not apply at all, but my dog started hanging out in a secret area like that and not really wanting to leave. Turns out she had a nasty medical condition that was seriously affecting her mobility, but she didn't have a way to express it. If he's hiding there and reluctantly leaving, I would recommend getting him checked out at the vet. Sorry if that puts a damper on your otherwise lovely video of your friend.
Finally someone else with a messy backyard. I feel like all I ever see is picture perfect houses and yards
For those asking, camera is an iPhone 7 (not plus) set at 1080p 60fps. Lighting equipment is Australian sun, I think it’s on Amazon

Also he’s a Mini Groodle having his first birthday on the 31st of Jan!
Damn that’s some great video quality 
I don’t know what hurts more...the incredibly crisp frame rate or the adorable look that handsome doggo gave the camera 
My dog started hiding in the brush the last few weeks of his life, apparently when dogs feel like they are dying they become reclusive and hide themselves 
I bet it's cool in there. My mom has special dirt holes in her garden for each of the dogs. They love laying there in the summer. 
Picture quality is amazing. 
B U S H.  B O Y E.
I’m just as equally in aww at the video quality 
My naem is dog
I maek a nest
Among the leaves
I haev my rest
Peace and quiet thats all. Not so much in the mood for a lot of talk right now.
It looks like he’s a Great Pyre. He also looks like he’s very hot and is hiding in the coolest part of the yard he can find.  Lucky for you at least your puppy is not digging big holes to cool off.  I had two of these dogs who destroyed my whole back yard just to cool off.  AND it’s not like they were ever outside long enough to be suffering.  They are just very great animals.  Your puppy is extremely adorable!!  
I feel exactly how this dog feels 90 percent of the time
I have a cat that is usually very obedient. One day, I was in my back yard chopping limbs off of a tree. I built a pile of limbs in the middle of the back yard. I let my cat out while I'm working because he enjoys being outside in the sunshine. He finds his way over to the pile of tree limbs. He goes inside of the pile, lies down, and stays there. Like I said, he is usually very obedient, but every time I tried to get him out of the pile, he meowed in protest and actually ran away from me and further into the pile. So, I just gave up. He loved being in the middle of that pile for some reason and eventually settled down and took a nap. He was just having a great time being out there under those branches.

Thought for sure there was a cat that climbed that lattice. 
Awwww he found his cozy spot!

This made my week 😍
HUMAN! I FOUND A HIDEY SPOT!
Good boy!! 💙🐾
Imagine being that cute and having people all over you all day! He needed “me time” 🤷🏻‍♀️
how dare u disturb him!!!!
[Hey my dog was doing the exact same thing today!](https://imgur.com/gallery/mTVZr8l) 
 Cute dog. Cuter frame rate.
I love his casual attitude.  No recognition or concern that it's a little odd.  I'll just smell ya aka "what's up bro, what you been gettin into"
why don’t you clean your yard? it looks like its been nuked
Video so clear I was there 
A pleasant glade.
Oh there you are Perry.
r/cozyplaces 
He might need to be alone. When my dog was not well, he'd go to his hidey-hole under a huge Rhododendron. I would call him, but if he was unwell, he'd stay until he was good. I didn't deny him his privacy.
Am I the only tripping about the camera quality 
Cutest dog!
Boop that snoot! 😍
Lol his face was like "awe damn I gotta find another spot now"
That’s the doggie equivalent of a pillow fort
FortBoi
Look at that fuckin boopy snoot
Oh my God, that is adorable. 
That 60 fps
Wholesome 
Did he find a different spot now that you've uncovered that one?🤔
that pup be like heheh you found me
Maybe someone might be able to answer this question here: 

The dog clearly sees what could be his owner but goes ahead and starts sniffing away. Why is the dog sniffing? I'm assuming the dog is sniffing because it doesn't understand what it is looking at but I am most certainly wrong.
Lots of dogs need a space where they feel they can be safe and not be bothered, seems like a perfect one! I'd make sure kids and adults I guess leave him alone when he goes there
From Australia? 
My old Golden used to do the same thing! She had a little nest amongst some bushes where she would chill and hide her toys. Such great dogs! 
He’s like ‘mom stop I’m camping’ 🤣
this camera quality seems insane 
You may have found him more easily if you CLEANED YOUR GAD DANG YARD!!!!!!!
Please be very careful with those type of trees (plants?) as snakes really like to hide in there and tunnel around. I had a dog that was almost bitten by a copperhead hiding in there, and my dog loved to use the shade to get away from the sun.

The quality of the video is so crisp 👌🏼
This does not make sense. Are you abusing this animal?

Grass tee-pee.  
What a cutieee
It looks so cozy.
What kind of pup? Looks like my Pyrenees a bit.
That is an official good boy if I’ve ever seen one. 
Just needs a little quiet time now and then. 
My dog also hides in the garden 
this is so sweet!!
Reminds me of when my dog would always hide underneath the drive way.
“damn! You found me!”
Was half expecting to find him with a mate and some puppies
My dog has a mulberry bush he hangs out underneath. Unfortunately, all the leaves are gone now so he's settled with the birds of paradise until later.
THAT'S HIS SPOT 
Good boy does a hidden and gets spotted. Grinnie time. 
OMG SO CUTE 😍😍😍
Dear hooman.. you found me
I have an English Creme Golden Retriever girl named Tilly, she hides in the bushes too!
It’s like when we were kids and built forts. 
Hello fren, wanna relax wiff me?
He's just alone with his thoughts, in his garden.

Hi buddy!
Kicking it with all the spiders and shit.
He’s the cutest!!! 
Best surprise ever 
Hiding pupper is cute pupper
Awww. Some me time :)
Looks like you found the dogfort. 
The video quality is like whoa man
Mine hides under the deck. When you call his name, you can hear him hit his head on every board on his way out.
Leave him alone he wants to be on his own 
Lol

Welcome to my crib
Great song! 
Maybe doggo had a doghouse in his previous lifeo
I can’t get over how clear this footage is. also, adorable ending Op. 
Awe probably so nice and cool. Smooshing a few plants is worth it for the bestest boy
may be it's just too hot 
Didn't check the sub and thought your husband had setup up video games in the bushes.
he got that perfect hiding spot. 
A house we were renting has a huuuugee blackberry bush in the back yard. And my golden mix had a whole network of tunnels running through it!

THANK YOU for using image stabilization.
He is having some me time 
Probably cuz it’s 600 degrees outside. Give that good boy a hose
Haha that laugh at the end is the universal understated laugh when you catch your dog doing some ridiculous or stupid shit
/r/all
My family’s Golden would do the same thing. She would always go lay in my mom’s flowers and plants.
Awwwww
My first dog used to do stuff like this. We had a lot of daylily along our driveway and he would sleep in them during the summer.
Awww, what a sweetie-pie. 
That's his home away from home
LET HIM GO DECOMPRESS IN PEACE
Looks really peaceful 
i love him
My old retriever used to sit on a bed of my peanut flower...she looked so sassy.

Omg my cat escaped outside and I spent around four hours search the neighborhood for him and after I finally gave up, I walked by the bushes in the front yard of my house and heard a squeak—it was my cat just laying there like this purdy pup haha
The boy has own private spot
Look the dog is cute and all but can we talk about the FPS in this video 
I like your dog
4K good boy
This has nothing to do with doggo, but where did you get your clothes hanger? I've been trying to find an upright one for the longest time 
I think this is a hint that you should help him make a ~~little~~ medium sized dog clubhouse 
It’s his happy place do not disturb
Did not know this was a video at first. Looked foreeeeever for him. Found the play button right before I went to the comments for the answer. Also, due to your emoji, I thought I was looking for a fox.

What kind of camera is this?
So much cuteness I’m gonna die
That melted my heart! So adorable!!! 
Messy backyard. 
man this brought back memories of being in elementary school and using these vine overgrowths as a little secret hideout spot.
I keep replaying this lol

You need to trim the shit out of those plants lol
Are you recording at like 600fps with a gimble

My chocolate lab will lay in inconspicuous spots in my garden too. 
I hope you gave him shmackos!
The bestest boi!
My Australian Shepherd did the exact same thing in a patch of ferns in our yard near our driveway.

He made a little nest in there, and would sit there for ages watching the entrance of the driveway, unseen.
No hoomans allowed 
Fuck human found my secret spot!
‘Oh, I see you have found me’
This dog is so pretty that I forgot how to breathe for a moment.
OMG, this GIF quality. 
They are the best pups!!!!
Last summer, I was outside looking for my cat, Mocha. I heard him purring (he has respiratory issues so he's *really* loud) and doing little chirps, but I just couldn't find him. I finally look in the long grass around our fountain and there he was lounging in the cool shade. Such clever animals!
We all need our quiet time
My dog has a spot in the garden underneath the Tiger Lilies that he likes to relax in during the summer
Kinda hard to lose a big white dog. Trust me. I know! Great job in the hi quality. 
He made a fort. You can't come in. You don't know the password.
OMG I WANT A DOOOAWG! 
Cozy af
If that isn’t r/cozyplaces I don’t know what is
he is enjoying the nature:)

It magic to show a dog =)))
I love dogs
Did u powerwash ur steps
God I wish that was me
Anyone notice that gum commercial in the background?
Maybe they should just clean up theirs garden 
What a h*cken good spot
Please pet him and call him a good boy
Oh no, hooman found my hiding spot, cat musta told em
Awesome, adorable dog/hiding place. I must admit though, the real question on my mind, OP, is how goddamn nice is that camera??
lovely
My dog hides in the bushes when its bath day.
You boop that cute little hider right on the snoot right now!
That camera is awesome!
Laughter or bless you?
omg!! what a sweetie 
As a precaution you might want to schedule a full checkup at the vet

Such an Australian backyard lol
I love finding my dog sleeping in weird places. It always looks so cozy.
What kind of phone was this shot with? That’s the clearest most HD video I’ve ever seen on Reddit. 
Sometimes, even dogs need their alone time.
Doggo lair!
You discovered his spot. How dare you. 
wow what kind of plant is that
Honestly, I'd love to have a spot like that myself. 
Is this filmed at 10,000fps?
I don’t know what it is about golden retrievers, but mine also loves to hide in the bushes like these. Weird dogs man 
A worthy cross-post for r/cozy places
🤭 Mmm that frame rate 
Is it hot where you live? It's summer here and dogs doing the same, trying to get shade & find cool damp soil & bark to lie in.
Sneaky boi
Ohmygod 
Awww beautiful baby. I love dogs
Boop
I needed some time to myself bitch.
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Omg! What a cute 
He's out there to get way from something. Figure out what that is and I'm sure the neighbors would be happier for it too. I'm guessing it might be the loud music in the background, but it could be heat, smell (cigarettes/cannabis) or another animal.
Buttery smooth framerate
Wait...how do you have 13k karma but this post has 80k?
I get that whole "man cave" thing...
Bless you miss, you found me!
"FUCK!!!" - dog, probably
What is going on in your backyard, though?!
"Hello hooman, sorry I forgot to tell you where I'm "
I thought it said “finally found where my husband has been disappearing to” 
Any dog experts know why a dog would find a hideout spot like this and lay there for an extended time? 
Dog nest
High quality vid. 🙂
Looks like australia

Your dog is an introvert. :)
Lol you found his secret club house
You found his secret base!! 
Is that a drone you flyin?
"Do you mind, Karen?  I just want some 'me' time."
Better clean up
That's a very aussie looking backyard you have there :)
Has he been hiding coz it’s been 45 degrees? Can tell you’re somewhere in Aus. My cat’s been lying under the daybed on the verandah tiles, where it’s cool.
Everyone needs their own personal alone time.

Hi, the world like a looking glass, only for everyone.

So comfortably, cozily he is lying there!! :-O

Cooling off in the grass 😌
Looks like Australia. Hope you’ve been letting him inside with the AC this week
It's really incredible...

My doggo has a similar little hidey hole. We found years of lost toys there
He just needs a bit of peace and quiet :) maybe you have kids?
Somehow... somehow I knew this was Australia mere seconds into the video 
He looks like he found a very cozy spot, it reminds me of that scene from My Neighbor Totoro where the kids have to crawl through the little bush/grass/forest-y tunnel to follow the little sprite things. If they had turned off to another trail I bet they'd have seen this good boye. 
I’m just in awe of the video quality. 🤤
All these things will be lost in time like tears in the rain.

Time to die.
Oh no, my base have been caught!
I don’t know why but this is easily one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen. Maybe it’s the look

That's one mighty fine boy 
That looks says "My clubhouse, you are not invited."

Such a cool and comfortable little cave he's found for himself. And after looking into his face, how could anyone say no?
Mine has a spot underneat the cedars beside our raised deck.
He must love to hang out in his crate. 
What camera is this?
Probably saw a lizard there once. 
Maybe doggy didn't have any shade and had to engineer a solution?
puppo trying to stay cool :) 
Don’t disturb them 
Lmao
Omg he is the cutest 
*Cute stare intensifies 
I need one of these dogs in my life. When I see them I feel the need to stoo, lay on the groung and give them all the love my physical being can give.

New years Eve I agreed to watched the cat of my roommate. To protect him from the fireworks, we locked him in her room and went in to calm him and see that he is well. But 15min into the New Year, I went in and the cat was gone. Just disappeared! Puff! No cat! I was horrified! How should I explain that to her, and my brain! What happened to the cat? I was worried to death. Me and my b-friend searched the whole room, everywhere... At least that's what we thought. We gave up the search at 1a.m. next morning, opening the door and there he is, waiting  for food. So I wrecked my brain, looked around the room again. And finally realized, that there is an opening in the tile stove, opening into the space inside it. What a hideout for a scared kitty!

In sir David Attenborough’s voice -

“What we have here is Doggo is the wild undisturbed for millennia”
You just lost your dog on multiple occasions before this?
I can't help but worry about ticks? Super good boy btw :)
Dogs hide from their owners because they're being abused.
Was expecting footage of a snake, not a doggo. 
So no one is going to talk about how amazingly steady this camera is? Pretty sure it was a Pixel. 
How old is your pupper? I don't want to be this guy, but if it's a new behavior for him, maybe he's sick... dogs tend to hide to "protect" themselves when sick. Good pupper
Are you sure he’s not sick?
