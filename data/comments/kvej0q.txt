I love her...
We were able to trap her on Saturday.  Took her to the vet on Sunday and after spending the night for a fever and upper respiratory infection we picked her up this morning.  She’s around 10 weeks old and a purring machine.
So glad you helped out, poor thing must have been petrified.
What a precious little biscuit! Her face is so smooshable.
Oh my gosh did she have to get her little leg shaved for an IV?
That head is thiccc. I can't get over how awesome she is
This was almost the same story how we found our cat. 

This was around 4 years ago, and we were catching fireflies. I saw something run across the street, and I thought it was a groundhog. I went to a bush, and it was a tiny kitty! No mother, and we later found out she was only 4 weeks old, so she was either abandoned or her mother was killed. We took her in the next day (my parents said that he mother might return) and we had a new family member. She had a parasite, which caused explosive diarrhea, and was really skinny. We brushed her up, made some cardboard houses, and we still have her today!
Give her a good home and plenty of love!

Took in two wild cats years back and I never regretted my decision ☺️
What a little joy! Have you decided on a name?
I'm so glad you investigated and found her! She's absolutely precious. Thank you for taking care of her.
Oh my God I love her and would possibly die for her. Can you boop her gently on the nose for me, please? 😍
Oh my gosh her sad little eyes!  The look on her face is like, "I thought you guys were never going to find me."
CUTE!!!
She is a cutie 🥰 
Thank you for rescuing this precious pretty kitty ❤️
I bet someone already said this but please check with neighbours and online missing cat forums ( ESPECIALLY THIS) 
We recently lost our cat and it’s sad to think she could be inside another person house in our neighbourhood without them knowing she is missing. 
I also want to say thank you for taking her in and making sure she is safe!!
She's precious!
Ludicrous levels of cute
r/IllegallySmolCats/
I lost my cat a few months back and I’ve always been told the story “maybe someone has taken him in” and I’m hoping the story is still true, I miss my cat dearly thank you for grabbing this poor baby and giving it a new home
She has chosen well :)  Enjoy
She is DARLING! Oh my goodness, what a dear.
Shes so cute, I love her!
My cat has been missing for 4 days now. This hurts real deep
My cat died near the end of last year. She was my first real pet and I was surprised how devastating it was when she was gone. This kitty looks just like a younger version of her and I'm just filled with some kind of emotions right now. I love and miss you, Tiggy.
She’s a chonky little one!!
This is how my husband and I got our kitten! Well, she was meowing from the bushes outside our bathroom window, but yeah. Your kitty is adorable, too! :)
My god. Look at this little face.

She will bring you joy and fun and yes, frustration for years and tears to come.
She’s the cutestttt little bunny
Aw sweet baby! So glad you found each other
She is adorable.
Very cute! That's how I got my cat 9 years ago.  Tiny little kitten crying outside in our woods when we got home.  I always thought I didn't like cats, but my heart melted a little and I couldn't not keep her.
Be sure to check that your neighbors aren't missing a cat!
Only the most special humans get chosen by their fur babies!  Congrats!!
“I volunteer to be your kitten !”

“Accepted ! “

Purrrrr....
For a week, I heard meowing in my backyard. I searched high and low and never found the poor kitten. Until one day, it was morning and I heard the kitten by a shrub. I walked over and a bird flew away to a nearby tree...the meowing followed. It was a damn mocking bird meowing the whole time!
She has anime eyes.
Does anybody else think this cat has pretty eyes?
I want to hold her tight
She's beautiful! That face.
Ngl she looks like the cat version of /r/13or30
She’s got such a big face and lil chunky body. Can we get more pics?
I respectfully request an Instagram page for her
Thank you for taking her in! Lovely little new family member. 😊
Im curious if my theory with this is right. My cat was also found because of crying out and now she is the loudest most vocal cat I've know. I swear it's like since it worked for an emergency early on it stuck with her more. So she knows to scream for emergencies but she also treats everything like an emergency.
Wow she got lucky and found the right people. Thank you for being the kind of person to help her, and double so for being the kind to adopt her. I hope you have many happy years together.
Chubby lil face
My god her round head I love her
Yeah I’m gonna need more pics of this cat please
We need more photos of her!
god my only wish is for every stray to find a loving home. 

there was a dog whining somewhere up the street from me the night before last, i'd never heard this dog before so i went out at around 10pm to try and locate it to make sure it was just someone's pissy/shitty dog being kept in the backyard. my ginger cat, who was already out and about in our yard, guided me up the road to where *he'd* hear the whining coming from. sure enough, it seemed like it was within a backyard, not out crying on the street or hurt, so i lingered a bit to make sure then scooped up my cat and went home. 

when i got back home i was kinda dumbfounded that i was the only one out on the street at that time. *i mean it was LOUD, whines.* every single person with working ears should be like you guys and just check when you hear an animal that sounds hurt/worried. peep out your windows, at *least*. i hope i wasn't the only one who checked on the dog that night, because it sure felt like it.
This is the sweetest kitty I have ever seen. Her heart in her eyes ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
OMG What an adorable face!
Awww 🥰 Thanks for saving that kitty🎉
10 weeks old huh? Prepare too protect your toes! It's go time any second
Isn’t that the absolute sweetest thing you’ve ever seen in your whole life. My gosh
Those eyes and that whole face is adorable
Thank you for loving her. Please keep her indoors 100%
Thank you for showing what humans are capable of.  And thx for saving this little sweetie.
What a darling!!
L O V E
Awwww so cute
Aawww... Such a cute lil' thing... :)
What a baby face!! I predict she shall have a grand wise face in a year lol
AWWWWWWW  (you picked the right sub for this post)   
Thanks for the back story too - congratulations
oh my goodness!!! I wish I could find a kitten in my backyard!
I WANT MORE PICTURES
She looks so concerned for everyone else even though it sounds like *she* was the one that went through the wringer. So precious.
She’s so cute!!
Omg she’s gorgeous
Ohhhh my goodness those sweet eyes 🥴🥴. I’m melting!
Such a cutie pie.
OMG her sweet little face!!!!! 😻
I showed my GF and she's demanding I get her *this* cat. Like full on Veruca Salt demanding it. Our 3 cats be damned lol. So if by any chance you're not able to keep her...
so cute what's her name?
Poor thing 
So glad you found her
I love her. Thanks for saving her life!
What a cuuuuutttttiiiieeee 😍😍😍😍😍
She needs a kiss and I volunteer 😢
What a sweetheart!
New friend!
Finders keepers!
Made my night better
Baby!!!
Congratulations on being adopted, human!
This reminds me of a cat that one of my piano teachers adopted. It was sitting outside of the window and meowing incessantly. After a day of this, my piano teacher finally gave in and took in the cat (which was a kitten at the time). It was one of the best decisions she had ever made. :)
Cat has been to vet ( shaved paw).  If you didn’t take cat to vet it’s someone else’s.
Ahwee what a sweet baby
Omg she’s sooo precious!!!
Photo is post vet visit and IV I assume?  I heart your kitty.
That cat was recently at the vet, it’s arm looks shaved for running an iv.
She's adorable! Her little Muppet nose is killing me 😻
She looks like a Maine Coon. Get ready for an extra large extra fluffy cat with lots of cattitude.
Adorable meow -- may she being you years of love and affection

Hoping one day to be able to have a meow in my life
awww her little chubby kitten cheeks 😻😻 happy you saved her!
“Can I haz new home?”
Oh my god, she's so cute I'm going craaaaaaaazy.
I gained my first cat in a similar way. Thank you for bringing her into the warmth
She has chosen you
She’s so perfectly shaped. I’m a sucker for that almost British shorthair round head.

Also so smollll for a 10 month old.
She still looks a bit uncertain, as if she's still wondering if she will get to stay in a warm home with regular food.  She will no doubt need a great many pets and cuddles!

You are good people.  Thank you for rescuing this little sweetheart!
A cute little chonk
She is a QT.
Thank you, hooman
She’s completely adorable
Has anyone seen my cat?
They are great as kittens. It’s later in life when they start sneaking out....coming home late....you try to discipline, but they just scream “you’re not my real dad!
Whats up with her little left paw? Is she hurts ? :(
u/karriee73 thank you for taking care of this sweet little baby and wishing you both the happiest memories together for many years to come!!
That cute face! That big boopable snoot!
Baby 🥺
is that a bare spot on her front leg? almost looks like where a vet would put an IV or maybe she had a hurt leg that was bandaged.  she may be lost or something since she seems really young. i'd get her checked for a chip. people that don't care about their pets rarely have vet care done.

if she's got no home you can find enjoy! it's a beautiful kitten!!
We need an update in a few days of a happy warm fuzzy blanket full sprawled out nap kitty.
Congratulations on being adopted by a lovely kitty! 🧡🧡🧡
Cat: Oh human let's be cute, *meow mooew meoooooew* *big eyes*
Hooman: oh cat so handsome, let's take care of it
Cat: You are miiiiiiiiiiiine now
I love her and I’m going to need you to post about her often, please!
You didn’t find her, she chose you.
Thank you for being an exemplary human being! This is great. She's beautiful and found her family.
What’s wrong either her leg?!
That eyes
I assume you’re keeping her?
Lil chub
PLEASE KEEP HER FOREVER
So cute
SAVING THE CHONK FREN
Came from out of the back yard and  straight into your heart
Awe I could never say no to that face
Omg look at her precious little face!!! You ARE keeping her obviously right? Please say you are!
She's so cute!!! What a sweet lil face awwww
Please see rule #1.
What can I say more than awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww ???? ♥
now i hear crying in my backyard?? (it's me, im crying)
Congratulations you've been adopted by a cat
She literally looks like a potato and I am in love.
lovely
I heard a cat crying in one of my neighbors backyards on Friday. I looked and couldn’t find it and it eventually stopped. I’m just going to tell myself you’re my neighbor
Wow she looks so exhausted
Holy fuck boys, that's a good lookin kitty right there!
I realized right away you were kind enough to take her to a vet when I saw her arm was shaved for IV infusion. Thank you, caring souls!
Pssst psst psst!  Cute kitten, great save!
SHE'S SO FUCKING CUTE!!!!!!!!
That poor baby. I'm so glad she's ok!!
LOOKIT THAT STUBBY LITTLE FAAAACE!!!!!!
I love them. May I be an honorary internet auntie?
Aww! Poor kitty! She found a new home I hope!
This face... must put it in my mouth!
THOSE EYES!!!
Omg 😭 what a little freaking CUTIE! That faceeee, awe. Im so glad you found her
125k upvotes in 16 hours?!?!?
People adopt dogs, cats just happen
What are you naming her?
What an adorable little thing. She is so fortunate that you heard her crying and brought her in. She is doubly fortunate that you took her to the vet to get her the medical attention she needed.  A sick and suffering little mite like that would not have lasted too long outside.  Bless you for caring for her. I’m sure she is going to enrich your lives beyond your expectations.
Can we have regular updates?
Judging by her wrist, I'm guessing she had some anesthesia.

Is her red face from the respiratory infection? I saved a stray kitty from the snow one night and her face was also super red like that.
You must keep her and protect her forever. You have no choice, you have been chosen.
Beautiful and adorable ❤️
Thank you for rescuing her!
Wishing you both many happy, healthy, and prosperous years together!
Anytime I’m not feeling well, my oldest cat lays on my chest and purrs....it’s weird but I think it helps
I love her and would give my life for her.
SHE found YOU❤️
I would die for this baby
Did you check to see if she had a home?
Love her and keep her furever.🐾
Ohhh love that you found each other! What is her name??
Oh my heart
Awww she looks like the sweetest kitten. Poor baby. I’m so glad you found her! ❤️
Such a little derpina, I love her

Poor babe!!
Aw I want that to happen to me.
Oh LORD, help me, that is a cute-ass cat.
Thank you for rescuing her and getting her care. She’s a cutie!!
What a cry baby.  I love him so much
That face tho 😻
Why do they look like a cat and a kitten at the same time
Thank you for being a good person🙏🏻😊
Squeeeee!!!!   Too much cute to compute!
She looks like a Dragon Li breed. The M on the forehead, white paws and strips. Could be worth even 700€.
She’s so sweet! So glad you found her!  She has strong potential for r/peanutwhiskers
looks like she found a good home
Oh my gosh, what a cute little cat
That's some yee yee hair on that wrist.

Thanks for helping her out! I'm betting that she pays you back real nicely!
You are now a cat owner. Congrats 👏 you have been adopted 🥺🥺🥺
what a preshus little potat! Thank you for helping her!!
She’s a lil nugget 🥰
Thank you for saving her.

Omgggggg teh kyootnesssss aknfiejdbfkdjejdj!!!
Hello my baby, hello my honey
Give an update on Delilah sometime.... so cute. Thanks for being a good human being.
Funny enough I was also crying Friday night and nobody found me
I love her
That nose instantly warrants a boop.
Okay but what did you name her?
Okay she’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
She’s adorable and so lucky you found her!
No fur on her leg?
Imagine if humans just screamed and yelled at the top of their lungs when they felt unwell. Like, even just a fever.
Be careful with that Flerken.
Thank you for saving her! Poor baby must have been hurting with the respiratory infection. She gets to stay warm and cozy now.
What a sweet face she has!
I’m so glad you found her 💗
She’s so cute!!!!!!! Lucky you!

She finally found you!
She looks like she's been through some terrible trauma :"/

No more crys...
Hearts!!!
That's also how my two little hell-raisers found me. Congratulations. You have been chosen.
She needs all the love! You can see it on her face.
You know those things live, like,20 years right?
Oh no her poor little nose looks congested and swollen. Or maybe that’s just her face, I dunno. But she cute. Hope she gets better soon.
Is she a dog in a cat costume? Her fur coat seem to be lifted up revealing her right wrist.
She’s so sweet! I love her little face! 😻
Two are great xo
She is really cute! So glad you found her!!
Oh my gosh..that face!

Issa baby Schmidt.
At this point, after reading almost all the comments about this cuddly kitty, I wanna confess that my family actually has over 45 cats.. Hard to believe, I know, but trust me, I do XD
Why are Cat noses always so cute and small?
I'd take a bullet for this cat.

those eyes says alot shes so cute <3
She’s precious!!
She’s really cute and her expression shows she’s probably been through a lot. Always makes me wonder what happened to the rest of her “peeps,” mom, siblings, etc. She’s a smart kitty to meow for help. Putting all her faith out there :) she’s a pretty big kitty for 10 weeks I think.
Cant see her face, how old is she?
Caught yourself a beauty, well done!
her cross-eyed appearance makes me think one parent was a siamese, the other a tabby. beautiful baby
So cute
Did we just become best friends?
So proud of y’all! Beautiful souls.  ❤️
Awwww
Little baby
She’s really cute ! I’m so glad she came to be yours !

She’s soooo cute!!!! What a baby!
I've always said, "family is a matter of coincidence,  but my best friends choose me." Enjoy her!

I got a soft spot in my heart for cross eyed cats. So cute
D'aww. What a beautiful kitty. Thank you for rescuing her!

Pretty cat.  Is the nose color because of illness or will it stay?
You just stole someone's cat
🥺
She found you 💚
I think your cat is my cat’s sister 🤨

dear lord the cuteness of that little loaf.  Congrats.  What a sweet little one.  I always hate wondering if there were any others that were lost out there, so glad she found her way to you.  I hope Miss Tundra Butter Beans or whatever her name ends up being brings you many years of joy.  I want to see more pics.
So cute! I’m glad you found her!
Awwww😍😍😍😍😍
Good
Any chance of some more pictures, please? 😻
Turns out the crying was from a little girl who lost her cat
You saved her life! <3
Yayyyyyyyyy sweet little bbbbbby
so cute
Saved a Bebe
Good people!  She is gorgeous!!
Who dat?
I know little about cats.  Is she young enough that you should be looking for mom and other kittens?  You also might want to put an add in Nextdoor to make sure no one is missing her.
She’s pretty!
She so small 🥺
That serious little face is gonna get some serious loving goodness.
She’s precious
BABY
Friend
I love the cat
Oh my goodness, she’s the sweetest thing! ❤️
Thank you for saving her
She looks like she's seen things.
I love my kitty more than anything but do you wanna trade?

False. You don't find cat... Cat finds you.
This is so wholesome!
My heart says:Awww" and I say 😭😭😭
Aww she’s the sweetest! Looks like she hit the Jack pot!
Careful, that's how you end up [with this over 20 years later.](https://i.imgur.com/b5q5Hcf.jpg)
Make sure to give her lots of kibbles cuddles and love!
I WANNA GIVE HIM A HUG
