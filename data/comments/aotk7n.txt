My cats would jump from the top of that thing, onto my face.
Any of them argue over who gets top bunk?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to bed unless everyone else does‚Äù cat
‚ÄúUntil morning, my loves‚Äù oh my heart!!
If that is NYC the rent for that has to be 2500 a month. 
This guy has a commanding voice. He could yell commands at me in spanish and I would obey and I don't even speak spanish!
Very cute! But the dog at the top needs a roof, too! Dogs love "caves".
Surprised one of the dogs didn‚Äôt end up in the cat bed while the cat took a bigger one
So efficient and adorable. Did you train them to do this?
Wow those animals are awesome and whats even more awesomeness are the people who built it and trained the little ones how to use it.

WHATS EVEN MORE AWESOME is that kitty waiting for the dog's to go to bed first... I ain't falling for this again... I get to my bed then everyone leaves, smart kitty playing it cool
I do not want children, I want 2 dogs and a cat I can do that with 
Well-behaved kiddos. Nice work! 

Also, look at those tails wag, jeez. Lol!
I thought the cat was waiting to use the dog as a step stool.
In my head, "Heh, that dog knows Spanish..."  
  
Then I remembered it's just as weird that they know English as well.
Cat patiently waits on everyone to get in place as this is actually his bedroom.
Fucking cats. I love them. I own one. But fucking God dammit if they don't all just stop at, or step in, or lay on **exactly where you need to do, or go, or use something** like they just wanna cause you a small bit of minor  inconvenience each time. Just an itty bitty tiny amount of stress 3-4 times a day for shits and giggles. Just to make you wait a few moments or go out of the way to gently move something or them out the way, or have to move around them. 
Those animals are smart... They know Spanish... That's a hard language. 
"until tomorrow my loves"

Eeeee
Life goals! 
Cats and dogs love having a schedule so this makes sense!! They probably have been doing this with the dogs since they were puppies, and cats are super easy to get on a schedule no matter what age.
how adorable! how did you train them to do this?
The holy trinity
This is cute, but here's my problem: Why not just buy a giant bed so the dogs and cat can share the bed with me? 
The cutest bunk bed I‚Äôve ever seen!!!!
I wish this had sound. Would like to know the commands they are using and watch them work. 
I wonder if the cat has a favourite nap-time buddy out of the two dogs 
My humans can't even do this. 
It didn‚Äôt make me go awww it made me go

Of course there's cat, the overlord. 
Wife is definitely topless as soon as she leaves frame.
This dude's parenting skills are on fleek.

Bunk beds! It's like camp. 
If only!

I get 4 square feet on the queen size bed if I'm lucky.
Animal pets>actual fucking kids
That is cool
The trifecta!
I love this!  But curious as to how many times the sneak onto the human bed during the night.  
Unbelievable üòÆüëç
This made me unnecessarily happy! I love their little bunk beds. 
I love how the cat waiting to finish the stack!
Forgive me if this is a dumb question but do animals sleep with human sleep schedules? 
So orderly! I find this r/mildlysatisfying 
The cat took advantage of that one Husk's patience. He had enough of her shit and just walked past her.
Hmm I wonder if my cat ignores me because he only speaks Spanish?
I watched this far too many times
Every day is leg day for the cat
This might be the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Of course the cat is the last one to follow orders.
Until just when you‚Äôre falling asleep then all three are in your bed. 
"Danggit kitty ur alwys in mai way"
This is lovely. I'd like to see a hamster at the top though, maybe with a runner going all the way up. 


"Throws a party when the lights go out"
I am so porn damaged.
If only humans acted so civilized..
It‚Äôs all fun and games til the doorbell rings
what is the cat doing wrong? seriously all of you people are hating on the cat and calling it an asshole??? im confused?? what is it doing wrong?
That is awesome!
Love it!
This is the cutest thing ever. 
Honest question:  how does one train a set of dogs and cats to do this ? 
That is so cute. I love animal lovers. 
If only humans acted so civilized..
Doggos are in trouble, the cat has the high ground!
This is soooo fantastic 
I want that to be my life. 
that is adorable.  in my house they'd all be wrestling for the same spot.
TAPS! TAPS! GET IN YOUR RACKS!
This is what I aspire to achieve, THIS IS WHY I WORK HARD
Ok this is super cool
This is super cute!!
Hey I never asked you, do you like guacamole?
@shadowfoxx817
This is so cool.
r/TiredDogs
For some reason I find this incredibly satisfying 
That cat is going to launch itself off that bunk onto the bed in the middle of the night
I thought the cat was going to jump on the dogs back
"Hasta manana, mis amores." Awwwwwwwww
This is the cutest thing I saw this week! 
This is amazing!!!!!
I'm shocked you managed to get them all to use their beds. Our golden retriever would rather sit on the doormat than the dog bed.
I wish I could get my animals to do that
Sounds like Josh Gates
Catnap comes out on top
Arraging breasts at the beggining
OMG!!! I‚Äôm dying from too much cuteness!!!
MY HEART
But moooom. I dont wanna go to bed!
So well behaved.  Is it possible to learn this power?  
I want to copy all of the people who say their pets can‚Äôt be trained to sleep in their own pet bed.
A place for everyone and everyone in their place.
i thought cats were nocturnal
I bet they'd prefer to sleep snuggled together.
Hopefully not a studio apartment 
Wonder who made the bunk beds
Oh wow
So cute‚ù§Ô∏è
Cat could take a benefit of a little bigger bed IMHO

Really cool ..... You're quite crafty!!
yeah.. really is time for bed. i have to sleep. erghh
r/husky 
But what if they want to cuddle? Then what?!
I think the real aww here is how sweetly he speaks to them. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I feel like the cat is most impressive part. Like how the fuck do you train a cat?
So cute!
I can‚Äôt even get my dog to sleep in the same room as me 
I can't imagine setting up and letting an alarm go off in that room x.x 
 We dont deserve them. Oh my heart :')
It's easy to spot that this is fake, the cat is using something made for him!
So cool this bed üò±üòç
Screenshotted so once I‚Äôm old enough to buy 2 dogs I can do this
How did they train a cat 
That bottom section looks so cozy.
They all have their place!  Aww.
I love this more than life itself.
That‚Äôs funny

Dear god I wish we could teach ours to do that. They‚Äôve gotten more intrusive lately and now basically pin me down by laying all around me on top of the sheets.
I wish I could get my cats to do that instead of crying to get under the covers, crying to get out of the covers, jumping on my face, getting kicked out of the room, scratching the door to get back in the room, bringing bottle caps in to knock around loudly, kneading on my chest, etc etc, until the morning.

Telling the cat "hurry up you're causing a traffic jam" and then "Until tomorrow my loves"... This is the best ever
The little cat one!!! My heart!!!
The cat is obviously the ring leader with this bunch.
Goals. But they would all end up in my bed anyway
Wow.. envious

All the animals in our house all crowd in with us at the same time.  Cat, dog,  all we need is a weasel or bird now
They behave better than my kids
Way better than human children. 
I just realized the top bunk has the cat‚Äôs name on it

Akira
You can tell the cat was ‚Äúfirst pet‚Äù
Perfect
Asshole cat
100% guarantee that if I built this for my dog he would lie next to it
How did they pull this off?
/u/stabbot 
That‚Äôs freakin adorable.
Impressive
The only kind of kids I'm jealous about üòÅ
This is so cute and i really want to make one even though i don‚Äôt even have a dog or cat
That's a hella bunk bed.

That's absolutely adorable.
I'm guessing the cat jumps down at night and pushes the dogs off their beds. Haha
Damn Op ! You turned your home into a farm.
the white doggo got the premium room :D
Is there something online somewhere that shows me how to train an animal to do this
Purroof that cats rule all households.

I would imagine that keeping household pets in your bedroom, would hamper or impair your sex-life or intimacy with your partner. 
This made my day ‚ù§Ô∏è
I really loved the "asta manana mis amores..." at the end
This is my wife and I dream.... 
I can't get my kid to do that and he speaks the same language as me.
I LOVE
Yeah, they're better behaved than most kids now daysüò≤
I just love it how dogs take a full circle thinking that they are trying to find a comfy spot, only to end up lying down the exact same way as every night
You are living my dream
I was waiting for, "Goodnight, John Boy."

Wow!
/u/stabbot
How is this even possible?
That is so cute! Loving it
Oh my goodness. I love this.üíó
Best setup ever. 
That is too cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
Here's a Showerthought for ya. I never thought about it till now but animals born and raised in different countries prolly "speak" different languages since their owners speak to them and give commands in different languages. So a dog raised in Mexico wouldnt understand you if you told it to "roll over" in English and vice versa. That's kinda crazy and cool at the same time.
Omg this is a real need!
And my cats won't even stay off our kitchen counter.
Now that‚Äôs a great setup!   
If I've learnt to expect anything from cat and dog vids, it's for the cat to be curled tightly on the bottom, with the husky trying to cram itself onto that top tier. Pleasantly surprised. 
Not going to lie, the cat may just be thinking, I better get a snack for this!!  ü§£ü§£ 
How come there's no pillow on the upper bunk? Poor pupper.
That‚Äôs fucking awesome! üòç
Better kids
Howw do you train them to do this? I can‚Äôt get my cat to do anything...
This is the best thing ever
That is just awesome! 
That‚Äôs adorable! 
ü§©
the smell in that room...
Two hours later and they're all on top of their humans in the bed.
Akira was the name of my dog that passed away this year :(
Oh my godüòç
Beautiful 
Nobody asking how. I can hardly get one pet to sleep in a bed I get/make for it, how the hell you get three pets to get on a bed you made for them besides each other at the same time?
Wow!!
OM!!! I love it and will try to do a version of it! PS: your babies are so cute. 
Good job with ur children
I thought there was another all black cat that they were holding and was confused  as to why that one didn't have to go to bed.
Clearly the cat is waiting for everyone to go to sleep to get out of bed again. 
Do animals have bed times?  
Oh my god that bedroom must be disgusting
Can you teach my kids that please
Cat got smaller tighter average by its size place, it vant even lay. This is discrimination üòÇ. 
Love the pet sleeping tower. 
Oh wow everyone got nice bed ......the cat got the nicest view
I love this! 

I have 2 dogs and a cat. I would love to build this but sadly they wouldn‚Äôt use it. They don‚Äôt even wanna be in the same room as the cat :(
Yeaaaah, you can see the cat is up to something üôÇ
Super cool 
Cats are nocturnal so, as is usual for cats, it's just playing around to mess with you. 
Love this idea. Will be copying soon.
That‚Äôs a nice Sammy ya have there
This is just adorable
So flipping adorable
Kids? I don't see any kids. Just animals. Cute, behaved, but still animals.
Beautiful doggos. Husky and a Samoyed?
I love animals. And I hate people, who treat pets like they were children.
Omg I love this

Well, that's one way to keep them off of your bed.
Bottom dog is so sure of his spot he doesn't even need to do a 360 check?!?
im guessin akira is the cat lol, leche the white husky, and i dont think he said the other ones name
Where did these dogs learn Spanish!? 
10/10 would boop all snoots 
I wish.. bedtime in my house is more a race to carve out my spot in bed before the animals. 
This is awesome. The set up and they way they all actually get into bed lol I wonder how long it took to train them.

Omg theyre so obedient!
Bet that house stinks
Indeed
Absolutely adorable üòçwhat an awesome idea 
How do I apply your training techniques to my toddler?

If I had pets I would love to do this but I'm afraid they wouldn't get any sleep as my snoring is insanely loud. 
Wow I love how each waits for the one below him to lay down
Awesome. I have bunk beds for my dogs
Love the bunk beds!
That is cool. Whoever built could have a sweet business on their hands!
Wtf? Their bed is your bed!!!! I couldn't possibly fall asleep knowing that I could have 3 furr balls tucked up under me.
And now I‚Äôm going to watch Homeward Bound.
Holy crap this post got a lot of upvotes fast
I'm amazed this happens all at once lol
I'm jelly of your cute little farmily

Lemme see that one-two stack 
tiny ass beds and it looks uncomfortable
Every buzz feed journalist in 10 years. 
Is the cat wagging its tail a learned behavior from the dogs?
How'd they learn to do that??
Wonderful , ... but what happens if they fart all night , we have one dog and when he farts we have to get up and open windows , even in winter when it drops to as low as 5C !!
Really wish my animals would go to bed like this. 
When I say it‚Äôs bedtime that‚Äôs when they decide to run around the house playing/fighting until they tire out at around 2am. 
Everybody gansta till the cat pisses himself
I want 3 animals just so I can build this for them
Omg that‚Äôs so awesome what a great parent üòÇüòÇüëç

Why is the cat waiting for the dog to get in first
That is the most adorable thing I have ever seen in my life 
Stop calling animals kids. 

Yes, they are adoring

No, they are not kids
Isn't thia the dream? Isn't this what every person shouls work towards having?
This is actually r/oddlysatisfying
Looks so cozy. Does anyone else get sleepy when they see cute animals going to bed?
Cutest bunkbed ever. 
That is awesome.
What I wanna know is, do they stay in bed all night?!
/r/AnimalsBeingBros

/r/KittyPupperLove 
Even if you dont speak Spanish, you still understood that
Mmmm.... not sure if having them sleep right next to your bed is a good idea. The cat... he would probably just jump off an hop into your own bed. The dogs? Well, by experience I can say it‚Äôs quite tragic when they fart in the middle of the night.
Imagine the smell of that room...
That woman is clearly a witch. 
Those are some well-behaved animals! Most people's kids don't go to bed that easily. Someone did a great job training them.
This is awesome.  I didn't know you could train cats!  BTW, great set-up.
Which Homeward Bound is this?
The future I want for myself 
Cat is so annoyed but doing it cause they love you 
Fake, doggo's bed is the top one.
Actually doesnt matter cat owns all beds in house.
What are ‚Äúbed kids?‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready.
The cats tail flick looks like he's encouraging doggo to get on up.
Curious, can anyone place the accent?  Which country?  It sounds cute and lyrical.

I don't know why, but I read it as "Time for breakfast, kids". I was waiting to see how the cat would eat up there and wondering why they were going to eat in the dark... I'm gonna go grab some breakfast
My cat stands in the hall watching everyone go to bed and then goes to bed only to start prowling around 30 min. later. 
Love how cat is alpha- last to bed after dogs are settled
How'd you get your cat to do that? Lmao
That I the sweetest thing ever. Warms my heart‚ù§Ô∏è
Fits perfectly, those are some lucky animals
These dogs understand more Spanish than me. Not sure how I feel about that.

Ok but how in the hell did he get the cat to listen to him!?
What a great idea! I built my cat some shelves to walk around my room and she loves it! 
The cat is like, yo! you coming to bed dawg?
omfg their names are Akira and Asuka. What's the equivalent of weeb for latinos? (I might also be one XD)
I hate this kind of videos because it's wrong to let the dog sleep above you, he will feel dominant and never let the dog sleep in the same room as you too.

The white dog didnt spin around before laying down :0
Oh how cute
Oh my!  That‚Äôs too adorable üíï
They all have their special spot. Blessed night 
I just want to comment on the doggo on the top doing the extra spin-o-ramma as he lies down to bed. I'm fairly certain they do that out of instinct from before we domesticated dogs due to their need to pack down an area of grass to sleep in for the night.
r/all

Absolutely adorable üêæüêæüêæ
This is so amazing
Akira and asuka to bed... 
Maybe this ain't the right place to point this out but those animals are right there for whatever happens in that bed at night. It bugs me out to have a pet in the room while fooling around, many people just don't care but I just get so distracted thinking about what the pet is thinking about. Then sometimes you glance over and they're looking at you and you lock eyes and you gotta share this moment with them. I swear they treat you differently after too. I wouldn't be able to handle a 3 pet tower of judgement in the bedroom.
Omg the beds!
AAAAH HUUUUUUSKY SO CUTE
Ok I am jealous 
How did you make this? Or were can I buy it xD
That is amazing :D

Stop testing animals like they are humans. We can‚Äôt even treat humans like humans, so this is just dumb
That cat has no intention of sleeping
I can't even imagine how many smells this room has. Ew.
Imagine the smell.
A comma would help
