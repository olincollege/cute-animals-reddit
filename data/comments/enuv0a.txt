Meanwhile our dogs would have been flung into the side wall and overboard or tangled themselves in the nets. That is legitimately impressive.
Salty sea dog
I love the look on her face.. like " what the fuck are you doing.. we have a whole string of pots to pull and you are f*cking off in your phone."
and my dude gets sick in the Honda Odyssey smh...
maggie looks like she‚Äôs seen some shit
I wanna see Maggie walking on dry land after being out at sea for a while, I always wobble like a weeble like Johnny Depp in Fear in Loathing
Maggie is no greenhorn.
I like to think the waters calm and Maggie‚Äôs rocking the boat

My Wesh loves the water. Bet she‚Äôs in 7th heaven going out to sea.
Sure it's cute until she's staring you down like this while you're hurling over the side.
Ahoy furry matey!!!
Her name should be Eileen.
Just watching this makes me seasick
Where is Maggie‚Äôs life jacket? A rogue wave could hit at any minute!!!

You must be feeding her a well balanced diet!

She should become a surfer

Awesome, my name is Maggie and I ain't got those sealegs! Good puppy.
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be
I‚Äôm fairly certain I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to stand that straight or that still if you had bolted my boots to the deck.

My dog didn't come with a gyro. Can't I return it?

 Do dogs get toe bean fungus from constantly having wet paws?
I'd like to see an edit where the boat is still and just the dog leaning back and forth
I had an airdaile terrier named Scout. She was the coolest dog ever. Very stubborn tho.
Holy crap. She‚Äôs cute as heck. She looks like the dog drawn on kids‚Äô books.
man the atmosphere of this video is awesome.
My Welsh passed not too long ago and seeing this made me really happy....and sad.

Your pupper is epic.

After a week of that, your legs do that on their own, and you don't even notice the boat rocking.  When you finally step foot onto dry land again, they keep doing it and you feel like the land is rocking under you!
She's just vibin
Maggie should be wearing a life jacket!!!!
I always thought those types of dogs looked like older fisherman
Got me remembering of tin tin adventures.
That's a true sailor
2 legs good; 4 legs better
This is Welsh Terrier, such great dogs. If you want a bigger version of a Welsh Terrier, get an Irish Terrier. \~20kg, really intelligent, don't shed at all, don't smell, very strong for their size, wonderful personalities, super brave and very, very friendly. An even bigger version of the Welsh terrier is the Airedale, exactly the same characteristics....just a lot bigger again

Irish Terriers are just amazing. If you encourage them, love them, train them and spend time with them you will be rewarded with a dog that is insanely fun, brimming with kindness and a friendship that will soften your heart in the most difficult of moments. Had my IT for 7 years now and he's a true gift
Meanwhile, at my desk, I'm about to blow chunks over the side of the imaginary boat.
is this a welshie?!
Adventures of tin tin
Maggie gets a 15/10 on the good doggo scale.

My favourite breed
She's swaying with the times

She looks like an airedale terrier. Gorgeous
The gyroscope in that barkbox is impressive. 12/10 good salty pupper
That terrier has more salt than most sailors.
Looks like a robot lol
Omg this is adorable! Smart smart girl!

Of course, 30 seconds in the car and she pukes.

I'm not even upset. That's amazing.
That stance! Tight
Did you get all those giant tidepods out of the sea? Is there a special season for those or can you fish them year round?
Should their be that much water on your boat?!

i need this sort of stability in my finances and life this year. happy 2020 everyone
Yyyyyooooo!! The song in that video is When Am I Gonna Lose You by the Local Natives and it‚Äôs absolutely amazing go listen to it!
That is the most Scottish dog ever
I just got done muttering a string of curse words under my breath (long weekend of shit not going right.) This gave me a good chuckle. Thanks, Maggie with the mean lean
This is what I do in buses and trains
That‚Äôs the best pirate I‚Äôve ever seen
I'd say excited more than carsick. My Shep is over 50 lbs; but dogs are great travel companions.
My dad was a seaman. He manned the ship.

He said sometimes they would go through storms and the waves are chonker af.

His parents didn't send him to college so he packed a suitcase and went to the capital of our country and he did odd jobs here and there until he drove for a captain. There the captain asked him to go through a 2 year course. 

He then went on to travel the world. A lot of postcards. Hope I can travel around the world too someday. :)
What‚Äôll you do with a drunken sailor?!!
This looks like a scene from a movie!
This dog can handle the high seas and my dog ends up upside down on the floor mat if I make any turns in my car.

not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for maggie
Why does the constant rocking motion make people sick?
Airedale?
That‚Äôs an Airedale terrier right??
What breed of dog is that
That goat can balance!
My dog can‚Äôt be in the car without being leashed to the head rests or she would fly into the wind shield.
That‚Äôs exactly the kind of dog I‚Äôd expect to see on a boat.

Hey I do that on dry ground!

Sometimes I fall over though
Now I'm just imagining the whole crew being dogs in a deadliest catch episode

Is Maggie an Irish terrier or Airedale??
I‚Äôve only ever heard that song on one random radio station and it‚Äôs such a bop. Glad someone else likes it.
Looks like an Airedale Terrier.
Oh wow, good dog! suddenly missed my dog, used to drive up and down the mountains at speed all the time. He would sit in front passenger seat and do that, and even compensate for braking
No frog could do this /u/skinnyreesescup
I admire Maggie's vestibular system. Meanwhile my dog flails around my RV like a leaf in the wind. All 75 lb of him can't just figure out LAY DOWN! Just lay down. There's no reason for you to try and stand and look out any windows. I've tried the crate, that was a disaster. So for now, he's just like a drunk on the Sloop John B.
My one and true love.
Where's a human for scale?
Beautiful dog!  Don‚Äôt see very many terriers about.  Thanks for posting.
If this dog could talk, I'm imagining a dog-accented shanty sounding voice.
Maggie - master of the seas!
My dog is like that in the car when I corner at high speed, she knows the drill. I gave a friend and her dogs a ride once, not thinking much about the corners and threw her dogs for a tumble. I was surprised they didn‚Äôt know how to lean.
Maggie be going crazy on the sea
This looks like my gsd when she rides in the car with me
Listening to local natives, nice.
That dog is so calm, I'm not sure if she likes being of the boat or just gives zero fucks
That dog comes with its own aran sweater, it was almost born into that job.
He's so good, he looks like someone glued him there

I think that this was the Wes Anderson movie isle of dogs
Got better sea legs than me. That's for sure.
Tintin would be proud.
Omg what a cutie!!!
Is that the dog from Tintin?
My old dog used to do this when we'd turn corners while taking a drive. I'd take her for rides and she'd sit nicely on the passenger seat, leaning into every turn. It was adorable.

Great balance. My dog always falls over and over when driving inside of a bus. :b
He kind of looks like captain barbosa from the pirates of carribean
This dog should have a reddit account as well as other social media‚Äôs. I want to see more of it on the boat while it‚Äôs rocking.
That's why chickens and dogs make the best skaters.
she has better balancing skills that i do
This reminds me of Isle of Dogs so much
My guy loves going places, never a traumatic car experience, just.....get motion sick after a little bit. Not being able to see out the window definitely makes it worse but even with being able to see out the window he still will start to cry.....then to pant.....then to drool....then that‚Äôs my final warning lol.
What great name for a dog!
This reminds me of that Futurama episode of bender in the ship holding the explosive cake.
Don‚Äôt wanna be dramatic or anything but I‚Äôm ready to die for Maggie
Lobster pots?

Did Maggie get all happy and run around after you set the pots and the deck was clear?
I crabbed with a Chesapeake retriever named Johnny and he would celebrate a cleared deck. 
He also helped out by dragging fresh hanging bait (cod fish) out of our way and pile them up for us when we were running gear.

Anyhow, cheers Maggie!

You know when you let your foot off the brake and the car creeps forward? Yes that typically results in my Basenji being yeeted into the back seat. This is very impressive

I had a German Spitz who loved to ride in the car and would often ride beside me in the front seat. She fell over a couple of times in the beginning but quickly learned to lean in the turns and brace for braking. I never had to worry about it after that.

And yes she wore a harness that was attached to the seat. Wear your seat belt, kids!
That's a salty dog...now I want a drink.
Looks like she's been hit by a smooth criminal.
Watching this while sounding out race car sounds. 
Maggie has some serious talent balance wise.

That looks like an accident waiting to happen ngl
I feel kind of concerned. Why did you take the dog out to sea? She doesn‚Äôt seem to be serving any purpose and if this is a commercial ship all she is doing is potentially getting herself hurt. I feel like it‚Äôs kind of dangerous to have her especially in rough seas
