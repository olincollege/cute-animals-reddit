He loves you
Must have been hard to leave a job with perks like this. That face ‚ù§Ô∏è
Its all about the friends we meet along the way. Fur friends included
That dog looks like he is about to get off the improvised door raft so you can survive the sinking of the titanic because he loves you so much.
I got fired in February of 2018 from a job I had for 4 years.  We had an office dog named Chloe.  Saying goodbye to that good girl was the hardest part.
"No stop plz"
Now he‚Äôs just some doggo that you used to know.





Edit: üòÆ my first silver! Thank you anonymous stranger!

Edit 2: And a gold!! Thank you kind stranger!
First off, so FREKIN CUTEüòçüòçüòç!!! Second, do you know the breed/mix. I have a girl dog that looks EXACTLY like this doggo, I actually thought it was a post of her for a minute they look so similar.
Was it a.... Roofing job??
I absolutely *L o v e* when any dog or puppy does that to me!
A very good boi
Was this your tearful goodbye as you left? Cute pupper.
I have saved this image for when I have a bad day. Thanks OP
I hope you guys keep in contact :(
I like how he is watching you still out of that one eye.. :)
Thanks I‚Äôm a dog doctor. I concur.
His face, his fucking face
A reason to be excited to go to work ‚ô•

Satisfaction 100
Is it your last job or your last job?
Can I work with you

I love you, Phil.  Are you eating right?  Take care of that knee.  Goodbye, Phil.
Hes trying so hard to convey the amount of love he is giving you. His face is so intent on making sure you know it. He's the bestest boy ever.

A big, fluffy sweetie pie.
The goodest boy
r/rimjob_steve
I'm always amazed at how dogs respond to affection...even (especially?) strays and street dogs.
üòç
I read this as ‚Äúa god I knew in my last job‚Äù and it still makes perfect sense
What breed is that?
I'm sure he still thinks of you.
i dont know any dogs from work :(
What kind of dog it he?
A doggo of infinite jest!
i love little paw hugs.
Sweet
That's a good boy
That would be my dog now
ü§óüòò i want to hug him
What kind of dog is this? He looks like my childhood dog, Smokey. We never really knew what he was, but we assumed he was a malamute mix.
r/DogsIKnow
Now he‚Äôs just some doggy that you used to know üò¢
I want that job
One of the most beautiful, adorable and purest picture I‚Äôve ever seen ‚ù§Ô∏è

Dog is like: " Promise me you will be back!"
Now he's just a doggo that you used to know
Now he must be wondering where you went.
What would this dog's breed be?
Oh. My. God. This is so cute, my heart is literally melting
the goodest work companion
My father died, and my dog died.  Is it wrong I miss my dog, and loved him more?
What a lovely lad
I love making little dog friends at work!
If anyone would genuinely miss me then I'm sure they would be like this pup. I melted from that look.
Where in Greece were you? I live in Athens and would like to meet this dog. I've only ever met one nasty street dog, they're usually so sweet and well looked after by locals even if they haven't got an official owner.
I HAVE YO KNOW HIS NAME
r/dogswithjobs
He'll remember you :)
*good boah!*
UUUUUUUUGH This is too freaking sweet
Any job that included little hugs from a good boy like that must have been a good one. üêæ

melting my heart
ü§ó
Looks just like my baby girl
What job did you have and where do I apply
"Stay!"
Definitely has cool written all over!
Stop that dog now. It's against the law to be that cute.
"Stay!"
that particular type of mutt is a dang good'un.
That‚Äôs an old, sweet soul if I‚Äôve ever seen one. Bah gawd.
More like OP holds up severed torso and head of goodboye with his hand.
The little guy looks sad you're leaving. What breed of dog is that?
What a happy face!
This looks like my perfect doggo :)
That lovely ball of furr
Your new job must suck.
Not to be dramatic but I‚Äôd die for him

Pupper tax:
https://i.imgur.com/17tzKPe.jpg
That is the most soulful look I have ever seen.  It‚Äôs as though he thought of you and missed you everyday you two were apart.  Furthermore, he‚Äôs got you in the best grip he can manage and doesn‚Äôt want to leave go, lest you don‚Äôt come back.  In his mind, he is your dog.  If he doesn‚Äôt have a home, please make this beautiful dog‚Äôs dream come true and make your home his!
That adoring look and grip: hope the human was wearing washNwear trousers.....
.... "please don't leave me!"....
Cute
Jesus. Why do you have my dog
Aww! Omg so adorable!
Awww... perfect depiction of love in a single frame!
I can't believe how much I love that dog.
Watch your legs!
Did you give him a sock to set him free?
The way he‚Äôs standing, he also looks like that creepy bipedal dog from those Japanese commercials.
He knows you're leaving so he held onto you for as long as possible.
I want your last job
What kinda pup is this?
His eyes say so much.  He says, I'm glad to see you again, I'm glad I got to know you, I miss seeing you and please keep in touch. Imho.
Was he your boss?
I would've never left. The dog of course
Too cute üòç Wish I had such a lovely dog greeting me at work like this everyday
Ver adorb
Yes, he remembers.
Where is the bottom half of him?
And why is he not, your dog?!
Spread love, spread happiness ...
Which dog breed is this?
Now your just a dog that I used to know....
What an angel
dawhhh what a good boi
Just some dog I used to know
What was your job?
That dog is a real people person.
And you left?!
Now you're just a dog that I used to know!
Can I have him?
Congrats on your retirement
So precious
[Reminds me of a dog I once knew on a job site](https://i.imgur.com/tt5EfM3.jpg)

Looks like the new puppy were adopting. (Her name is Kelsey and some photos of her can be found on my profile)
Its a cute pupper
What breed?
And now you're just some puppy that I used to know
Did he belong to anyone? I can't stand the thought he's homeless now.
Just realise that I‚Äôm better at making acquaintance  with doggos than I do with people lol.
Where is the dog now?
Everyone‚Äôs rushing in to fill OP‚Äôs shift.
What breed is this please.
I'm impressed by both the pic and the upvotes
A true friend

Guys this is my friends dog!
Why in the world would you leave this jobby job.
I üíó this dog.
Some doggy that you used to know
This sub is way too good
"they're all good boys, Brent"
Does he have legs I can't see them
Seems like for this reason alone, it should still be your current job.
Honestly, that's half a reason to keep a job right there. You must've been awesome to that doggo. They were lucky to have you.
Now he‚Äôs just a belly that you used to rub
JUST A BELLY
Take him home!
üé∂now you're just some puppy that I used to know.  You didn't have to cuuut me ooooff üé∂
He looks EXACTLY like my pup, Luna. What a precious pupper.
That's a cute dog but downvote me.
You must have really messed up to get fired from that job. I'm so sorry. üò≠
