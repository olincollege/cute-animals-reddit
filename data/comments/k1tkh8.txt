This makes me so happy <3
Tail angels
This is really cute
Now we just need 4 dogs to create a circle. Then! Then we can use them as a green leaf mover!
He'd be pawsome at snow angels!
It’s like a windshield wiper for leaves!
OMG so cute
Aww he’s just doin’ a sweep
r/petthedamndog
Now that is a good boy
The big question is WHY AREN’T YOU ON YOUR KNEES GIVING HIM A HUG!?
I need a golden puppy in my life
You’re hired. $15 dog bones per hour, benefits, 2 meals per day, and lodging. When can you start?
Any faster and he’ll be a leaf blower!
Pupper pupper pupper pupper pupper pupper pupper pupper
Pupper has serious fall energy. Golden boy was made for autumn.
So he must be a leaf sweeper all the time! Miss my golden so much.
Better than any rake
A very good boy.
He's so cute :\*
He's so cute !! What a hard worker.

When it first starts it almost looks like a heart, and then he sweeps it away, like he swept my heart away............. I'll show myself out.

Sweet little baby 🥺💕
He has done you a service. Pay him with puppy treats.
And since it's a golden - it's usually happy
I hate the fact that pupper is a word now
He is the bestest boi
That is the most adorable goldy I've ever seen 😍
Bless this post
I would like to take this dog to the park some time
Cute puppy
❤️❤️❤️
Just keep sweepin 😍😍

I guess Golden Retrievers are called golden for two things. Their fur colour and their adorable attitude.
Doggos make the world go ‘round :D
Such a sweetie pie
Golden retrievers are a dog breed that I enjoy the company of so so so much more when they're old vs when they're young.
This is so adorable!
one point for the golden retrievers!
**PET THAT BEAUTIFUL FACE!**
This is so satisfying to watch.
When is a Golden pupper NOT happy? 🤗 Marvellous!
I could watch this forever
It's a Golden, so that would just be always.
The fact that the leaves get swept into the shape of a heart makes this even better :)
That's a dog, for the non-12 year olds.  And stop vertical video syndrome.
This is cute af
Oh man
Awwwwwww! I've always wanted a golden, this just makes me want one even more. So cute!
Which plant leaves are those ?
Such a happy puppers!
Awww
How cute is that baby :o

Dog is a broom confirmed
doesn't happen when he stands up
Beautiful dog
Love the white face on that old man dog!
aren’t Golden Retrievers the best? I had one for 13 years and she was the most loyal dog. Always slept at by feet. Never this thing of going to sleep with someone else in they house.  I miss her.
This is too pure for this world :(
D’aww
Awwww 😍😍😍😍
Happy dog sweeping leaves :)

A golden pupper among golden leaves
I love it when dogs are so happy and content that they do a half blink thing with their eyes. It’s adorable!
Put that good boi to work!
I want him to boop meeee
Those leaves are as golden as the pupper
This dog needs to know that we all love it as much as it loves its owner
As someone who has shared his life with two retrievers I believe I am allowed to say goldies are the fucking best. 

(But labradors are almost equally awesome.)
Powered by treats.
Awww made me smile , he is so gorgeous
the goodest boy ˚✧₊⁎❝᷀ົཽ≀ˍ̮ ❝᷀ົཽ⁎⁺˳✧༚
Aww, he’s adorable!
look at it, looking so happy!
Dog version of snow angels!
You have a beautiful dog 😊
Hired
Even though I’ve seen this exact vid posted twice I still love it and you made my day

Those tails are something else. My golden clears off tables, sweeps the floor, blinds people. A few minutes ago he hit a paper grocery bag so loudly, he scared the shit out of himself!
this is the cutest thing I've seen today
This makes me miss my golden so much man.
Excuse me, can I have the windshield cleaning?
Such a cutie!!!!

Someone make sure he gets treats for being good boy
Should call him Sweeper
Haha I used to use my goldens tail to sweep the kitchen. “Sophie come here. Sit.” Wag wag wag. Walk back two steps. “Here Sophie sit” wag wag wag. 10/10 would hire again
What an angel!
Thank you for this
So cute!!!
Aww

Golden retrievers are the best dogs ever!!!
This wins the internet today
So cute and so happy
