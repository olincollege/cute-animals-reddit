MY HEART 😭💕
my life is shit and its getting shittier day by day...But these videos gives me momentarily happiness.

Thanku OP
My legs don't work

But I can scoot

My mom don't mind

She thinks I'm cute

Now what is this

My legs are wheels

I just like new

The zooms are reals
That's so nice. My family is currently dealing with similar situation with our dog. Hopefully she wont have to get wheels
This is so beautiful
It _got_ happy, but it definitely didn't _start_ happy. But, yay for the happy dog!

Moment my heart melted
This makes me so happy 😀
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be morbid on this post, but I'm genuinely curious: why wouldn't they amputate the legs? It looks like her legs are just making it harder for her to scoot around. If anyone has any insight here, I'd love to be informed.
Omg I love this. Love love love
It's 1am but I haven't yet gone to bed, so my day has been made twice.
This has truly made my day better
I love her!!🥰😍
Happy endings like this are the reasons to keep us alive💛
I’m gonna cry 😭😭😭
I cannot stop smiling
I love.
I just melted. This makes me so happy. The sweet and pure joy in those eyes!
What are you doing to my heart?!!!!! 😭😍😍
LIL BRUDDER
I haven’t known peace until I saw this
OH MY GOD look at that smile, look at that ecstasy

I am crying, tears are springing from my eyes, seriously, my heart is so full of joy for that sweet beautiful pupper and his lovely, loving, wonderful people
Her name is Pidgeon! And she's on Instagram as @pidgeonpup
Welp. That’s it for me folks. Can’t get any better than that today.
Every good boy deserves a even better chance
I just cried so many happy tears for this dog
Awe what happened to my mans
Definitely got misty eyed
Beautiful ! Makes my day better! Thank you !!
TAKE THAT DOG TO A PARK AND LET HIM/HER RUN FREE
So happy! And that ball in her (?) mouth! Made my day ...
God bless you owner of the dog. It looks like that dogs been through hell and you making an effort to make his life better. God bless you dude
How does this happen to so many animals? What actually causes this?
Lt. Dog you got yourself new legs
I'm not crying, YOUR CRYING!
I’M GONNA CRY 😭😭😭😭
Why are there onions
This absolutely made my day. Thank you.
[deleted]
I’m super happy for the dog! What happens if his legs get m caught on something?
Okay his smile made my day
"Come on!!  You're going to slooooow!"  - pup at the end
❤️
Zooomies, here I come!!
I'm not crying you're crying!!!
That look on his face after sniffing his wheelchair is precious. damn, I teared a little.
That look after they sniffed it and thought, "for me." Yep, it's for you!
The happiest little story anyone could get karma from.
I wonder if the other dog is like, "am i a jerk if i want one as well"
Oh sweetheart doggo😭 this is the sweetest!
When reddit makes you cry at 3am
my heart fluttered i am so happy for this beautiful sweetie
A very wholesome post! Thank you for this. Bless that dog!
My dogs back legs stopped functioning like that about a year after we adopted him. This probably existed in some form 20 years ago but we were ignorant to it. We would carry on him around with a towel acting as a strap to lift his back legs. He slowly lost control of his bladder/bowls and didn't last much longer after that. We probably should've put him down much earlier but my brother didn't want to. Glad to see a happy ending this time.
Excuse me, my heart just melted.
I abhore seeing animals suffer. But this guy, thanks to a good owner and a doggy-wheelchair, s/he looks happy; if the dog is happy, then that's all that matters in my book. Thumbs up!
Not even Pixar can beat this shit
Omg look how happy this baby is once s/he can maneuver around! This makes my heart happy
So cool.  So. Fucking. Cool.
Look at that happy boi!!!!! Ugh! It just. I. FUCK I LOVE DOGS!!!!!
I am bawling my eyes out for this beautiful beautiful Dog and thank god for people like you who give them a chance at happiness love and life also to those who make it possible for Animals to still have the ability to get around and enjoy life. Have to go now cos my eyes won’t stop leaking😭💗😍
I wish I could upvote this more.
Somehow there are days when I think the human kind is still capable of being good.
That was so great to see. Doggie looked active and happy immediately
this is so wholesome
My heart can't take this.
That change in facial expressions is very heartwarming <3
It's enough to make a grown man cry 😭
She couldnt wag her tail but if she could, it is wagging so hard!
God damnit. There's been so many gifs like these lately and I can't help but feel so awful and shed a tear for these poor things, yet smile because they're powering through it. It makes my heart hurt so bad to see them unable to run around like normal animals, but It makes me so happy to see them happy being able to do normal things without a care in the world, or maybe just no understanding that there's anything wrong.
Aww man, this is the most heartbreaking and heartwarming thing at the same time.
Lt. Dan! You got new legs! :D
This IS the happiest story anyone could ever ask for.
I love that dogs don’t know that their disabled. They just know what the can and can’t do and don’t let anything get them down. You treat them like any regular dog and they live happy, fulfilling lives.
Gahdamn that dog looks so happy!
The fact that the dog is jumping around makes this a million times better
Beautiful
Aww. This is perfect.
Thanks for the uplifting video, I needed it. 

I was actually in the process of making a buggy for my girl who had a tumor that was affecting her shoulder. She had trouble walking around more than a few minutes at a time.

I still have all the parts laid out. I was going to build it this weekend and present it to her after her oncologist visit Tuesday.

I never got the chance. This morning a blood clot from her shoulder broke lose and she died in my arms.

I always thought a dog dying on it's own would be easier than having to put them down. I was so wrong. 

No time to prepare emotionally, no goodbye, blind panic. And thanks to the adrenaline, I remember every second with crystal clarity. I can still taste her bile in my mouth, still hear her last gurgling breath, still see her seizing up, still feel her go limp in my arms, still see her glassy eyes staring off into space. My arm still hurts from the CPR.

Anyway, didn't mean to write all that, but it was cathartic.
Wow, very nice, I am so glad for him! :D
What a lovely story!
Good doggo, cute doggo!!
If you could upvote a million times!!! ❤️❤️
This made my day and the day hasn't even started yet.
Bruh this hit me in the feels...
Awww!!  I'm in literal love with him!!
I love how dogs embrace (human) technology.

Honestly, although a cat person mainly, videos have convinced me that dogs have minds much closer to ours than cats do.
I wanna cry now
Oh my god look how happy he is! We don't deserve them.
This disappoints me. Original poster didn't get this much attention. Cute dog nonetheless.
Who is cutting onions this early on. Sunday?!
My heart. It hurts!
Look at those eyes. They’re so pure.
Stuff like this shouldnt be in aww.... it's sad.
What does the dog have that makes is not be able to walk?
Upvote gazzililion times!
u/masastip
Oh my goodness. When he pulls it over to the dog and the dog gives that look of “you bought this for ME?

😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
This reminds me of my dead dog😢
People cried watching this. Definitely not me. I would never cry. But people cried.
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Omg I just wana find the biggest smoothest field and run all day with him....
Aww, that poor little guy, I'm so happy for him. It's amazing how they always seem to be excited for life no matter what happens as long as they've got an owner that loves them. Cliche "we don't deserve dogs" response incoming - we don't deserve dogs.
Dogs deserve more than love.
This Doggo Has My Heart... God Bless You Champ.... Stay Strong
This made me cry.
💘💘💘💘💘 what a happy baby
What's wrong with her??
RRRRRREEEEEPPPPOOOOSSSSTTTT
[removed]
 Thank god schnoodle hasn't been here yet, or I'd be crying too much to sleep.
Did that dog immediately know that wheelchair was for him?!
[removed]
My heart, why is it hurting?
Gaining (or regaining) mobility is such a huge and life changing step for any creature, human or otherwise.
Damn ninjas
He’s so happy!!!
You are awesome. You made him happy. 💜💜💜💜
Well, here come the tears 😭❤️
Strange, my eyes are suddenly wet for some reason
My Golden got blood cancer and couldn’t use his hind legs for the last two months of his life. 

I bought him a custom cart just like this one, and even though he only got to use it a handful of times it was still the best purchase I’ve made.
Thanks for uploading!  I needed that!!
Omg this made me so happy. My baby can hardly use his back legs and we just ordered a wheelchair for him.  I am praying he’ll take to it like this angel ❤️
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6c1HWWspGo
Well that got me crying. So precious to see his:hers smile and bouncing.  It is beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
I think god put dogs on this earth for us...
Whats wrong with his legs?
You could feel his phantom tail wiggling like crazy..
Does anyone know why the dog can't use their legs? They look broken to me, is that it? Also, if they were broken, does anyone know if the dog healed?
I love it!!! Wonderful!!
Yay the pupper is happy
I love this so much I hope this gets popular
This is good
😭😭😭
This made me smile.
Wheels gave our boy the best last six months of his life. We lived the crap out of those months with him. So much to do in so little time. Thanks for this...
AND HE WAS THE ONE HOLDING THE BALL AT THE END ! Q\_Q
My dogs back legs are just like this however she found a way to waddle without full control over her back legs
Thanks, I needed a good, happy cry.
Awh how sweet, he's just full of joy !
This makes me so happy!
Best thing I've seen all day.
Optimists see the glass half full. Pessimists see the glass half empty. Dogs see the glass completely full of love
I'm not crying, you're crying!
This made me feel better 😌
God bless your soul ❤️ so sweet!
You are awesome
Now that is a happy doggo, think we can call that battle a victory.
This is so wholesome. What a sweet gift that changed its whole life!
Wasn’t planning on crying at 2:44 in the morning, but here we are.
No you’re crying.
He literally asked to be walked cause he was like I CAN WALK AGAIN LETS GO
That dog is going buff forelegs soon.
You got wheel Lt Dan!
Omg the feels
❤
I wish i could upvote this 10 thousand times. <3
Possibly dumb question: wouldn't it be better to amputate his hind legs so there's no risk of breaking them or dislocating his hips? Not trying to be negative, just honestly curious. He seems like a real sweetheart ❤️
Watching this while stoned and I swear I can feel that dogs joy. This is the first thing that’s legitimately made me smile in quite a long time.
Lovin it
This literally made me tear up ❤️
Are dogs ever confused by why these big animals give them stuff and help them?
Serious question - how does he(she?) go to the bathroom?
That's enough reddit for today
Everytime i see a dog in a wheelchair i just get extremely sad... they are so innocent and its so sad they have to live with that... on the other hand they have a new lease on life they can jump and play and go on walks... they dont feel sorry for themselves. I need to get a hold of myself. Im sorry *ugly cries*
Oh man, I thought the freshly sliced onion delivery wasn’t until wednesday *dabs violently at own eyes*
I'm crying 😭 I'm so happy.
That dog is disabled but looks very well fed.
I’m crying big, wet, sloppy tears right now.
That dog looks so happy! That excitability definitely reminds me of mine. (Miss ya every day buddy)
People: How can a dog walk on 2 legs?


This dog: Am i a joke to you?
The face at around 13 seconds 

“Ah! This is mine :,)”

Got me.
I’m frying on acid right now and this just brought me to tears, so glad this little dudes got some new wheels
Ohhh man i wasn’t ready for this...
This fucked me in the feels 😭😭
If that doesn't at least make you smile, you don't have a soul.
It sounds silly as fuck but I literally cried. I am so sensitive.
"Wut dis?"
Awww this is too much for me to handle on a sunday morning! Amazing
I think I'm crying from how happy this made me.
These videos make me so sad...
Do you ever watch videos like these and then watch it until it loops again and you’re like: shit now I have to watch it again.
Poor doggo
Well I wasn’t going to cry tonight. Nbd
Oh my goodness this is beautiful. That last look he gives his human before getting strapped in just looks so worried, so scared... then just pure happiness. 

It's wonderful. I love it. Good boy.
I would give that dog the biggest goddamn hug ever. It just brightens my day with that face.
Gave me some unexpected tears of joy😭❤️
This dog represents all that is good in the world
Watching this after a couple of whiskeys doesn’t help. NOW IM HALF CUT AND MY EYES ARE LEAKING!
Those slammy whammies and buttwigglu at the end!!!
This better be the top post of the month.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
This is beautiful
Congratulations, you've made me cry
I got curious. Will the lower body support elevate the center of gravity, preventing the front limbs from a proper rest?
This is the best thing I’ve seen in quite awhile
<3
I love his cute face when seeing that contraption like "For me!?"
Awesome!
r/Slammywhammies
The fact that dogs can become paralyzed is proof enough to me that this world is simply chaos. 

Chaos I tell ya.
Dogs make me not wanna die. Thanks OP I needed this. <3
Lt. Dog! You got magic legs!
OHhhhh what's sweet. It's really made my day. Im so happy everytime I know the pets have a great owner :D
My eyes... what is this liquid coming from my eyes?
How does that dog shit impress? Does it like just shit and piss all over its legs and you have to clean it up or what.....
❤️❤️
No more hop along, yay ... I mean arf arf! 🐶
Awwwww 😭😭😭
Stop giving me feels at work.
My neighbor growing up had a pack of Dachshunds and the oldest and leader was a paralyzed buddy with a wheelchair. He was also territorial and they roamed free on the property. Feistiest dude in the neighborhood.
That immediate happiness
10.85s: For meeeeeeee????

18.50s: Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Aww, is this for me- Dad? That dog is so happy!
What an angel 😇
I really needed this today thank you
This made my day
That was great story! He should rule the 7 kingdoms.
That is beautiful man.
This dog reminds me of Joe Swanson
No I’m not crying. You’re crying.
That ear drop once he realized what was going on got me.
Shame on you and this repost
I’m not crying, you’re crying
I need this for my dog
If that dog's name isn't Lt. Dan it &$#@% should be
r/zoomies
Ima wheel dog!
r/gifreversingbot
It's a terrible day for rain.
What a heart melt 😍 Bless!
I dead ass started to sulk at the beginning of this video. The ending made up for it though.
This gif just turned a bad night good.
I got home to my dog having done his back in again (3rd time in 18months) he couldn't move his back legs properly. This was almost my dog, but thankfully, drugs worked. 

I swear my dog is the wrong kind of drug dog.
I aspire to have just a sliver of this dogs happiness in my lifetime. What a hard ass happy pup holy shit
I. Am. Content.
Yes indeed the happiest story made my day
Me when my leg is asleep
That made me get a bit teary
Amazing..
Aww, dogs are the sweetest, your dog is so cute!
Fantastic 👍🥳
I almost cried :D, this is so wholesome !
Anyway i'm just sobbing, not crying.
Lovely caring owner.... you make the world a better place 👍🏻
The dog has this look like it just said "see I told you my legs worked"
need sound.
Muh heart!
I always ask this question on why dogs are apparently always happy? It’s so weird yet stupidly funny at the same time.
Lookit dat happy baby❤️
Omg I'm crying, this is lovely!
Aaaaannnnnndddd I cried.
Rickshawwww
His  very good
Made my day, I'm happy now.
This is very inspiring, I only wonder if he/she would benefit more from the wheels being a bit more forward?
ok thanks for making ME CRY. this is adorable.
So fucking wholesome, the love of a dog!!
Please don't post this you are making me cry! 😭❤️😭❤️
Que bonito perrito
I'm not a cryer, but goddamnit if this isn't the single most wholesome thing I've seen all day. I'm wiping a tear from my eye. The dog is so happy!
This fills my decrepit cynical heart with joy.

Bless you & thank you for giving that sweet digger love. Keep it up. Xoxo
Such a good boy. 😍
My fucking heart
Why do my bedsheets smell like onions. Damn onion-sheets.
A well spent few thousand dollars?
There was a border collie at my vet one day same paralysis. Broke my heart. I anonymously sent her a heavy duty wheel chair so she could go out and play again - the owner forwarded pics to the vet they passed along to me. Best feel good money I ever spent!
Do they have to take off the wheels for the dog to sit?
So happy for the doggo he/she deserves this and much more ❤❤
That dog’s name is pigeon, she is so happy all the time. You can find her on Instagram @pigeonpup
I know that this might be a mildly inappropriate question but I’m so curious. Someone please tell me, how do dogs that use these poop?
I clicked on this link without context and now I'm sobbing, oops
oh my
This is so awesome and such a nice change of pace from media doggerel that makes me want to kick someone in the teeth!!
Being an engineer just had to ask: what happens when the poor mutt wants a crap? ... could get messy. i.e. does the machine have a squatting option?
r/piratepets
Omg. His facial expressions! He's precious. When a disabled dog is first given and put into a harness like this, how long does it take them to adapt and become proficient?
Aunt and uncle had a similar setup for their disabled pit, remolded there house with ramps everywhere for that pup. Never seen a happier dog than zeus
ROLLER DOG IS BEST DOG!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Man that made me tear up, so heartwarming
They see me rollin' , They lovin'
You just put a smile on my ❤️ thank you 🙏......
Can anyone answer my question: I’m an occupation therapist and work wit humans with spinal cord injuries; so do dogs with spinal cord injuries have to be intermittently cathertized to pee?
Front wheel drive dog!
you can see how happy the dog is and that warms my heart
This has made my day.....thank you
Heehee
That’s amazing I’m so happy for this doggo
Sit! Good girl!
This dog reminds me of a dog that stayed on our base on deployment that we named Dangle.

🥴
omg
What wonderful people parents doggy has.
Hugs xxxx
He's so happy when he got in his chair! Awesome!
You can see that dog has no shame in its disability and is super happy with its owner.

I really wish I can be made to feel so much pure joy despite everything else.
Look at that smile
aww
Eyes just pissing tears
I’m full on sobbing
That does put a smile on my face
You can almost hear the happiness
This hits too close to home, I love it!

I have a case of short femur(my right leg being much shorter than my left), which disables me from doing lots of stuff.

I can just feel his happiness from here.
Dogvar the boneless
Look how happy he is with his little wheelchair, this is absolutely wonderful and it makes my heart melt!
I aspire to be more like this dog
**SCHMOOOOO** OMG in love
I love the little hops there in the beginning. So sweet!
He protecc
He atacc 
But most importantly
He get his movement bacc
Of course the first thing he wanted to do was go outside.... I love doggos so much
Its bring a smile to my face

Ok I'm crying softly in my gym like a fuckin child. Thank you Op, sincerly
Im gonna upvote this every time I see it.
I have an American bulldog and this makes me so fucking happy, that pupper will be forever grateful
It is. Bless his/her little heart.
I’m not crying, you’re crying...
This made me almost cry god damnit
I wish his name was Joe.
Aww at first he was like what’s that? Then he was so happy

This makes my heart happy.
This... does put a smile on my face
I love this doggy so much
I don't care how many times this gets reposted, I will watch it all the way through several times with my heart full
I just can’t do these videos anymore. I’m 28 and I’m learning the older I get anything with a dog in it (even a happy one like this) just gets me. I couldn’t even watch the full clip without the feelings happening
I just want to hug him/her! ☺️🌸
That little look he gave the camera before getting strapped in... "Really? For me?"
Humans could learn so much from these guys on happiness
First thing to make me smile today! Such a lovely pooch.
By gawd that was so sad at first, about wanted to cry.

Then got the fuzzies.
What happened to the little guy?
This made me so happy I want to hug my dog.
I’m crying right now so bad 😭😭😭 That’s so adorable!!!!!
When it jumps, it reminds me of those jumping cars from the 90’s hood movies
He’s so happy when he gets his walker on!!
doggo
I'm not crying, youre crying
Seeing the dog drag it's hind legs was so heartbreaking. This is an awesome story indeed.
Awww. He's so happy for the situation he's in! So optimistic! Your a very lucky owner!
CRYYYYYYYIIIIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGGG
Omg...that face!
Am I the only one who almost gets sad from these because the dog has to live with that in the first place?
P
😍😍😍
This reminded me of the dog on family Guy lol
I feel sad thinking other dogs might make fun of him in this.
damn, so sweet

i could never be like that
Sheer joy in the pupperz face 😁
Looks like he's still trying to wag that tail.
Oh god this actually was a tear-jerker
😍
Wow
wow
How does a dog like that use the bathroom?
The fence is where I shall reside.
Is this an American bulldog?

I got one just like her, glad to see such a cute puppers
Who cut the onions😭
We don't deserve dogs.
We really don't. 

But things like this show me we try to make up for it and that makes me incredibly happy
............you're crying
Poor dog
[deleted]
Is your dog called Rover now?
Crying happy tears
ngl lmao at the first 3 secs
I agree
Awesome
Look at you, pulling at my heartstrings.
Aww
So I'm just curious, if the dog is paralyzed would it be easier to have its hind legs removed? I mean it probably doesn't make a difference with the wheels but seeing him dragging his legs like that makes me wonder if it would make mobility easier/safer without them.
Happiest ever
I'm in Las Vegas, it's so hot here my eyes are sweating.
Bless him
This is so wholesome.
That is not tears in my eyes 😊
He's like, what's this, i can't eat this Karen... oh..
Why is there no sound?
Maybe I overlooked the answer to this question but why don't they amputate the legs if they're just useless? Wouldn't the dragging of the legs be a high risk of the dog developing a sore? Thanks!
Serious question: what is the pooping and peeing situation for a paralyzed dog?
u/kissdogs
Who’s cutting onions
Just a small question - do you have to remove it to allow them to go to the bathroom comfortably? I’m so happy that dog can run around now though, he has a great family :)
I hope they will amputate his hind legs so they could get stuck somehow
My heart is melting like butter
This is one of the cutest things I have seen today
What a fantastic dog, I love this. What happened to him though?
Full of surviving spirit
OMFG MY BABYYYYDHDGHSHSJA
I legit cried.
Omg I can’t even
My 🖤 what a lovely creature so happy and full of life and love
I’m literally squirming with delight
It’s times like these when I wish dogs could speak but then again their body language says it all
Why don't people understand that we need to hear the dog and person in these situations damnit!

Just the GIF won't do.
I’ve already seen 3 staffords with paralysed hind legs. Is this common with them?
God damn it I needed to see this.
Never skip leg day
I'm not crying you're crying
I almost cried no animal should deserves to be in that condition.
I cried so much for that sad dog but you were able to let it have happiness and fun love and luck to you and your dogs
His face...Before and after...
This just made my day.
This is truly beautiful!
Should those legs be amputated eventually?
Yay I *do* have feelings!!!
Goddamnit! I'm a grown ass man. What is this salty, watery discharge emanating from the corners of my eyes?
So beautiful
they never stopped wagging their tail 🥺 animals are actually so precious. protect them at all costs
What a beautiful pup
What a blessing!
This is beautiful!!!
what a perfect precious angel, living her best life
Is it bad I laughed at how the dog was walking, (in my defense I thought the dog was just being silly)
Bliss
The look of pure joy on his face
I’m a simple man, I see dogs I upvote
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING 😭😭❤️❤️
Lieutenant Dan! You got new legs!
love how she looks up and was like "for meee?" 🥺
Damn, ninjas cutting onions again.
You are such good people. Not everyone would do this.

Awww it’s soo happyyyy’ (:
ooohh my heart. My heart melted.
Doggos are amazing wish i could get a good boy/girl
This made me so happy to wake up too
I seem to see sooo many dogs like this.  Are they all getting hot by cars or are we knowingly breeding them like this?
Why is your dog disabled?
Does anyone know why the dog can’t walk with its hind legs? Just curious.
The dogs name? Lt. Dan
It's Pigeon! Follow "pigeonpup" on Instagram. The absolute joy in this dog's face will bring a smile to your face every damn day. I love her so much
where da kids at?

I'm not crying, it's just been raining....on my face.
Reddit seems determined to keep me weepy eyed today.
Ivar the boneless got some wheels
I’m so happy for you lil doggo
Stupid question: I'm assuming the only way for the dog to lay down is to be taken off device (I don't know what to call it) or they'll just lay down in a absurd angle?
This... Dose put a smile on my face. 💜
🥰
❤️
If this dog's name isn't Lt. Dan then I don't even know what we're doing anymore
Can I upvote twice
The smile on his face 😍
But... this does put a smile on my face
That gave me legit chills😭
well that’ll just about turn any frown upside down.
Super phenomenal. Can you imagine trying to put a cat in one of those?

I mean, a full recovery would be the happiest story, but pedantry aside this is awesome
I’m not crying you are 😍😍
I'm not crying stop
Love the owner of this dog.Big Love and Respect to You.
aaaaaand now im crying
This made me happy cry.
Bow your knee for the new king of wester(d)o(g)s!
My heart has melted to a state below liquid
My heeeaaart😭😭😭
I love this so much
"I hope it's got something so her legs don't get-ohmygod it has stirups so her legs don't get all flippity floppity! I love it!"
When he looks up after taking a look at the wheelchair, my heart exploded
So happy for this dog is beautifull 😃😃
Bless her\his little heart <3
Why y’all cutting onions so early on a Sunday???? 😭😭😭😭😭😭
I've been having a Murphy's Law kind of morning, and this put a smile on my face. Thank you.
This is actually the cutest dog I've ever seen. I want it :(
I'm crying.
I'm about to cry, I cant afford gold but I will give you a silver 👍
Well it’s 9:46 and I’m crying
The look in that pupper's eyes after she has sniffed and approved the "wheelchair" seems to say "Is this really for me? I can't believe how lucky I am!"
And the way she carries the ball so proudly at the end... Bah this hitts me good. I'm so moved!
I have a real hard time seeing partially paralized dogs. I'm not even a dog person but these little beans are so happy, most of them are so happy even being alive if they're disabled. Shouts out to Pigeon.
MY HEART
More footage of doggo rollin and playin
I'm not crying, you're crying
Hey 🅱️eter
aaaaawwwww you made my day with this!!! such lovely moment. 💘🤩🤩🤩🤩
YEEEEEEEEEEEEESSS
What if the dog has to poop or pee?
I love this so much. We can learn a lot from our little friends.
My heart. I need a dog
Omg that sweet face.
Our dog was a victim of a hit and run... twice. That made hind legs paralyzed. We were gonna buy him a "wheel chair" but he was too old and was barely moving.
I teared up a little bit. This is so wholesome
What happened to the dogs legs?
r/mademesmile
Owww
How does he poop?
Anybody saw my heart? It melted away
My eyes are sweating
Hgnnnnnnng my emotions
Two words : puppy power 💜 - Agree?
I've never smiled this big before. Intriguing.
The missing link dog to seal!
this made my morning. awesomness
how do they poop in that?
Dumb question maybe but how do dogs that are disabled like this cute doggo go to the bathroom? Do they know to rely on their owners to help them get into a certain position or...?
Ahhhh my heart 😭♥️ the sweetest good boi! I want to pet him so badly
This made my day after a horrible day
Kinda looks like Joe's legs from Family Guy..

Yes, I'm going to hell
Love him!! So  excited, let's go!  Let's go!  👍😃😃
One of the most loyal, and people pleasing creatures ever created.  Thanks doggoz!
My heart is melting 😭
I wonder if she urinates and defecates on her own or requires expression or if she is incontinent.
What a happy little pupper
front wheel drive doggo
I am happy for him, a relief more over a dog saved from misery.
I love how happy this pup gets. Literally jumping for joy 😍
Question: how does a 4 legged animal, with what I believe is paralysis, go to the bathroom on their own? Do they need to be cleaned after every bathroom break?
Lt Dan...You got new legs...new legs!!
Thank you.
This just makes me so happy!!! The look on that doggo’s face is everything.
I didn't smile for this.

Ok, I lied.
I love to see him or her walking but I don't see the back legs, did you have to cut them off or are the legs still there?
u/frankensciz0r
Made my morning.  Thank you
Just wow!
This literally brings tears to my eyes. My day was so bad today, and THIS just made it a little better. At least someone is happy. Im glad for him!:)
How does she poop?
Momma look! I can walk and run!
“I feel like a dog again! Woohoo”

-Dog
Happiest boye ever 😭
Sending all my love for this doggo!
What breed is the doggy?
Man my little buckeroo passed away couple months ago n this got me tearing up. Thank you for posting.
Sob made me tear up n shit
Awwww this just gets me! Fuck I love these creatures so much!
This actually melted my heart
It’s just so unfair. They don’t deserve those hardships but they handle them better than most humans. I may be ugly crying.
I'm not crying! You're crying! 😭
I WOULD LIKE TO SUBMIT AN APPLICATION TO PROVIDE THIS DOG WITH AFFECTION AND PETS UNTIL I SHOULD PASS ON FROM THIS EARTH THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME
That brings tears to my eyes.  Someone didn't give up on that dog when many would and just look at that love and happiness
Dogs are wonderful. But so are humans - we gave that dog WHEELS.

Sometimes when I see how happy we can make dogs I don't want the world to end.
Aawn this dog is so adorable ! But I have a question : why does his back legs doesn’t work ? He has some type of illness ?
It's a terrible day for rain...
Such a happy boy!
It almost makes a grown man cry
Isn't this a repost? I remember seeing this awhile back...
That face of pure emotion. Beautiful
One of the most heartwarming stories I've seen in a while
Yep, my eyes may water
Now can the trolls even hate on this video ?
Sweeties!
Can we all take the time to donate to animals Asia or Mark Chang’s charity that rescue pups from Yulin’s dog meat festival and give them homes. No dog or animal deserves to be tortured.
This is perfect.
Slad? Sad Glad? Is that what I’m feeling?
That's Pigeon! I follow Herndon IG
That's Pigeon! I follow her on IG
Love this video!

So good to see a happy doggo
r/specialaww
Feels good man
Muda
It’s sad to see dogs like this living terribly and not being adopted.
But this is truly beautiful.
Why do you have to make me cry?
I really didn't need to cry today but at least they are happy tears! He/she is so precious!
I cRIED
Zero to weepy in seconds flat.
It might be the gin talking but that was heartbreakingly beautiful. Pup is so full of love that her disablility moved me almost to tears, and then to see her happiness when mobile again moved me the rest of the way.
Damn, you profited well off this repost... oh wait, it’s just numbers on a screen.
Youre crying Im not crying :crying:
We dont deserve dogs
Why am I crying in the club rn?
I am not crying you are
I’m not crying you’re crying
Man that is the coolest thing. Anyone who has anything negative to say about Pit Bulls is a moron. This video clearly shows that they can be the sweetest little creatures in the world. 
He was so happy to just be able to go for a walk with his friends.

Ohhh so sad! 

Can I repost next week for that sweet pity karma?
You fucking dopes gilding a repost
Who’s cutting onions up in here?
Sorry but this seems cruel. Animals don’t have the same cognitive abilities as human thus cannot make sense of a disability.
The things these people will exploit just for points on the internet.  I hope that poor dog knocks the owner down some stairs and paralyze them. Then someone can video them dragging their lifeless body. 


I hope that dog has peace soon.
Similar with humans, would prefer not to see disables animals on aww.
yes
