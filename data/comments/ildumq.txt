Those lashes tho....
This video was taken at Aimee's Farm Sanctuary in Queen Creek, Arizona, the calf is called Duke and the chicken is called Rex :)
If you’ve never met a cow, I would highly recommend it. Go to a sanctuary or find a neighbor with a cow. They’re incredibly sweet and have amazing eyelashes
Cow and chicken irl
MOMMA HAD A CHICKEN
If social media has done anything good for me, it has expanded my awareness of animals and what they are capable of in terms of communicating and experiencing love and happiness. There are so many examples of animals giving love and wanting to be loved. I don't think I would be able to be aware of this if it wasn't for people posting so much about the daily lives of animals. I get happiness watching these things, and deeply appreciate all of it.
The endearment when she says "... that's his chicken." 😂
His eyelashes are lush
The chicken at the end of the clip is like “Haaaalp! You’re strangling me!” But a sweet video, nonetheless.
Think its time to transition from vegetarian to vegan.
Beautiful animals and so lucky to be at a sanctuary.
This is what I needed now
I literally want to be vegan now
r/animalsbeingbros
/r/happycowgifs
This is why I shall now eat only plant meat.
This is tooooooo cute
Do you ever see something so wholesome you cry a little?
[Careful, my bones!](https://external-preview.redd.it/4TlvwZdbLMgv-HKh9uGtFBNa6QImiwpULG_mPCs2i6o.jpg?auto=webp&s=f251dc6fc9c8e169cddac1e802abff4c984ae2b5)
I guess I'll be eating vegetables for dinner
Officially a vegan now
Weird isn't it? Two of those 3 animals are routinely killed and eaten without a morsel of guilt.
This shit makes me want to go vegetarian at the very least.
Babies 🥺♥️
idk how ppl can eat these things
That’s one cute cow
Think kinda stuff make me wanna go vegetarian 😌
Okay I’m vegan now.
My wife and I spent 5 days at 2 The Rescue Animal Sanctuary & Camping a couple of weeks ago and it was magical. After a day or so the animal population just treats you like one of their own and it was so wonderful to connect with them in a slow, peaceful environment. I had my guitar and serenaded them with Beatles, James Taylor, etc. We had such an amazing time being in there presence.   [https://www.hipcamp.com/discover/california/2-the-rescue-animal-sanctuary](https://www.hipcamp.com/discover/california/2-the-rescue-animal-sanctuary)
This actually made me say "awwww!" out loud.
This is my chicken. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
HOW DO I DOWNLOAD THIS?? PLEASE
Every day I get closer to a vegan life, and this is a gently firm reminder to keep going.
why are people apologising to others for not being vegan? Its not about us, apologise to the animals
Cow be like "eat more chi- I mean, go vegan?".
Just opened reddit and this was first top post. 

Ya know what? I'm logging off. This is the type of stuff I want to remember all day, the world can be cute. And that's how I want it to be for the rest of the day.

Y'all beautiful people have an amazing day and do something that makes you happy today no matter how small it may be. Y'all deserve it.
I think cows are just giant dogs and i love it.
Appa and Momo
"Mama had a chicken."
cows are such gentle animals
Killer eyelashes on that baby.
Oh look! Another adorable reason to go vegan :)
This is why I’m trying to be vegetarian, I’m almost fully there.
cow: I don't know either why they like to eat us...but I wuv you...
I wonder how many people think they care about this cow, but will continue eating meat...
Reminder to stop eating animals ❤️
Maybe don't exploit them for taste if you find this cute
All the love and cuddles
Ah yes, the live action Netflix adaptation of Cow and Chicken is looking great these days!
Hope they play well as they get older.   A full grown bull's head can be massive and wouldn't take much to accidentally hurt his little friend just by resting.
Aww, cows are so gentle
now go vegan everybody!
Omg thats so pure. Idk how people are capable of eating or exploiting these beautiful beings
If you truly care for these animals, you should really consider going vegan. It makes no sense to talk about how cute these animals are while still supporting all sorts of exploitation of them.
And too think some people actually justify eating these sweet creatures. Unenlightened cretins
RIP my heart.
This is why I’m a Vegetarian.
This is the best thing I have seen all week
Cow and Chicken!
I like when pets have pets
r/happycowgifs
Omg STOP IT 😍😍😍
Cows are like giant lovey dogs if you've ever been around them. If you spend enough time around them you realize they all have different personalities.
This makes me wanna go vegan
I want me. GIVE ME MORE *starts twitching and scratching arms*

Cow and chicken.... a cow... and a chicken...

Nope, don't got nothing I can use there
I watched this 20 times in a row just to hear the woman quietly say "that's his chicken"
Gotta love animals.  Love you unconditionally
Someone please hold me like this I need it lol
This is precious. Chicken at the end: OW!! No smashy!!
Is the chicken content or scared?
Its not his, they have each other
Eyelash goals
Can that cow be mine

That chicken would be my cows chicken
The cow and chicken reboot looks amazing
grass puppies!
Oh my fucking GOD!!!! 

I miss cows so much, we use to have a farm and growing up I’d nap with the cows.

They’re the cutest, sweetest little babies ever! I want to buy land some day and get some highlanders
Look! I has fren! He stay with me. He mine.
I’ve never been loved that way ... I’m jealous

There's a Chik-Fil-A joke in here somewhere
Hey it’s the Netflix live action cow and chicken
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Cows are so fluffy wuffy adorable \^\_\^
People in the future will look back on how humans treated animals with horror and disgust.
Amazing how most animals can understand loving those different from them, but many humans seem to struggle with this concept.
And people ask me how I was able to go vegetarian...
Just here to mention the old Cow & Chicken cartoon 🥰🐄 🐔
He's like Lennie Small from *Of Mice and Men*
Cow N Chicken!
Cow and chicken the real series.

“Eat les chikin”

poor guy. Cows are such gentle creatures and we stand by while they're slaughtered

like, at least if we eat polar bears they did something to deserve it
[removed]
I raise cows for many years, and this is really unusual. Thank you for sharing!
That's his chicken, but they're both my lunch.

CHICKEN ANDAH COWWWW!?!?!
Why am I crying in the barn
Chicken: said "That's my cow."
Losing my moms farm of 48 yrs I've had wild animals covet me and had bulls butchered at the same time to keep the balance . Very painful. Have one chicken left from 7. A fox got them all. Could ha e killed him but it was my fault for not locking them in at night. Blind willie johnson is my song.
Dis my chicken, just like dis my bandanana
My heart 😭
I’m always a sucker for a cute Hereford.
Strong Lennie vibes
No south park references? Seriously? A group with our talents?
Do do do dododo ‘Cow’....do do do do dododo ‘Chicken’...Do do dododo...’Cow and chicken’

AFUUUUCK YOU COW ANDA FUCKU CHICKEN! -The Japanese
Lol!
Kinda choked his chicken for a bit at the end.
🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
Oh my God I think I have died of cuteness look at that cows eyelashes and how sweet it is oh my God I think I need insulin
Omg why is he so pretty?!
Through their inspirational love, the Chick-fil-A wars came to an end and the countless chickens sent to die by the cows came home to roost. However, peace was short lived as they came together to realize their true foe: humanity. And so the Farm Wars began, leading to the genocide and enslavement of all humanity.
The chicken has a very majestic comb
Y'all ever heard of the show "Cow and Chicken"? This is them now <3
Duke is so god damn cute
Keep it up r/aww . I am so close to going vegetarian. XD
Mr moo moo and his bock bock!
Yeah, I didn't know horses ate anything other than oates , hay and carrots, lol!
i love them so much!
Goes against everything chick fil a stands for
Sweet
He's totally choking his chicken.
Chick-fil-A does not condone this message
He would make a very bad chick-fil-A employee
I bet that chicken’s anal fissures would feel fantastic rubbing up against my ballsack.

Cow and chicken???
This is a Chick-Fil-A PR nightmare
Are cows one of the more loving animals, I’ve seen so many videos of them just so nurturing, a lot with dogs. I started wondering is it because they have their baby cows taken away? 🤔
White chicken, brown cow 🎶
Animals are the best
He almost chocked his chicken there at the end ......:)
They're so cozy !! I want to be embraced too.
Oh my God matching white eyelashes. I am cant evening so hard right now!
