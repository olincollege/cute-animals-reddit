Delighted to learn that peekaboo works with dogs, incredibly cute
A dog's tail is always such a giveaway! When my dog is chilling and I start approaching, she tries to act cool but her tail is going crazy
What a good dog! Her little tail and the love in her eyes says it all!
My lab/golden/GSD mutt will get all the way under the covers, but leave her whole butt and tail out. She likes to think she‚Äôs hidden so I‚Äôll just walk in and say, ‚Äúhuh, I wonder where Harley is.‚Äù And her whole butt wiggles as her tail slaps the bed. I let her stay ‚Äúhidden‚Äù for a while before I pull the covers back and pretend I‚Äôm shocked. She loves it
That tail wiggle as soon as she sees you...My heart can't take it.. its too darn cute

That tail!!!!
I'd hate to think what our planet would be like if there were no dogs.

Today in Toronto it‚Äôs going to rain all day and potentially ice rain at night. I am going to be on my couch, curled up with my dog, for the rest of the day. It is the best use I could make of my time.

Aw the bestest of dogs. I don‚Äôt let my pitty sleep with me anymore because her snoring was keeping me up. She now sleeps with my six year old. Kid can sleep through a freight train and doggy is just as happy. Best buds.
My chihuahua could power a small raft when she does this
Surprise twist: that's actually his tail when he sees the dog's face.

Yaaayyyyyyy!!!

I just love how the tail stops wagging and starts again
It's simple physics.  The dogs eyes are converting the light energy into electricity which powers the tail.

I kinda got freaked out because I have the same exact bedsheets and I thought I was looking at a video of my own room for a second (with a random dog I don‚Äôt own lol)

AND THEN I SAW HER FACE
I have that same blanket and almost same looking doggo.

Aww. Pavlov‚Äôs lesser-known Lovebug Experiment.
Fuck this shit. None of us deserve dogs. Ever. What a magnificent species.
Mind if I ask, can dogs control their tail consciously so they can hide their emotions?
Best feeling ever!
Oh my god I just melted.
God I wish that was me
Awwwww that's so cute! Hug her ony behalf
Aww what a cute boi! ‚ô°

Photo-sensitive tail wagger
My dog is notorious for getting stuck in places that she can‚Äôt get back out of, and her thumping tail is always the give away. Then when we find her she‚Äôs trying to play it off like ‚Äúthis was fun, right guys?‚Äù
That's a nap you just don't get up from
My dogs are the greatest thing to snuggle up against in bed. Can‚Äôt even remember the last time my girlfriend was closer than 3 feet from me in bed. The dogs must have the middle of the bed.
Reddit is so bipolar when it comes to pit bulls. One post they‚Äôre hating them and saying all these terrible things and next post they‚Äôre the best dogs. 

They‚Äôre the best dogs. No need to call them names or anything crazy
**What a cute lil landshark....**
That wiggle looks like a dogo?
I like your comforter.

Dogs are programmed with no poker tails.
Simple things like this make me miss having a dog. We have 2 cats now, and one with cuddle my hip every time I sleep, but she *never* looks even slightly excited when I wake up. She just gets annoyed that I have to move I‚Äôm pretty sure
She is the goodest girl.
Hey, OP. I know this is obvious but you should know that I would literally die for your dog in a heartbeat and if you have an Instagram for her please link a bitch up.
So sweet. My dog and I used to nap like this ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your dog has face detector software installed.
Dogs are pure joy tbh
A tail of true love.
So cute
That tail wag is priceless!
That‚Äôs true love.
I love her tail wags when she is peeking!
Legit has to be one of the most adorable things I‚Äôve even seen.

I don‚Äôt have a dog but my friends dog when I approach her tail starts to wag like she was in  world war 2 .
Those bedsheets are either from Target or Walmart because I have the same ones. I think I got it from Walmart though
She trying to act cool and be like ‚Äúyeah nothing special‚Äù but her tail gives her away every time.
I have a little rescue chihuahua that didnt start to wag his tail until maybe six months after, i slowly trained him to wag when i ask ‚Äúcan i get a tail wag?‚Äù... absolute magic
The tail wags always get me. Beautiful dog.
I see a tail wiggle!!
Priceless.  That is a happy pup.

Is that a CPAP machine I hear?
One of my dogs wags her tail when I pet one of my other dogs. I don't know if it's because she enjoys seeing them wag their tails of if she's anticipating her own upcoming pets. But it's cute as hell.
‚ÄúHi mom! Oh. Hi mom!!!! Oh.‚Äù
This is so precious
tail movement intensifies
My dog loves laying under the blanket that hangs over out feet, but the problem is she thinks that no one can see her if she cant see anyone even though her entire rear end is sticking out. And when you pull the blanket up her tail starts wagging, its soo funny.
Adorable dog. Kind of random but where did you get that comforter?!
We call that one the ‚Äúthwap-thwaps‚Äù cause that‚Äôs the sound it makes as it bounces off the couch!

Thwapthwapthwapthwapthwapthwap!

I wag my tail at my wife every morning but she doesnt think it's cute.

Absolutely lovely. Freaked out when I saw you had the same comforter as me, though.
I have that same duvet
I would be playing that game with her for the next hour!  Just to see the happy tail wags.
Your girl is absolutely gorgeous! I love how happy these sweet little babies are - my Stella wags her tail everytime I start moving near her to pet her, even when she's half asleep and I roll over to wake her up, she'll start wagging her tail while her eyes are still closed. Dogs really are just the best <3
Just had to comment because there were 666 comments and well had to fix that. So now.. Yeah
I wish my dog did that... jk I dont have a dog

Poker-face dog
My dog has been sleeping with me more than usual. Lately I‚Äôve learned he really likes being wrapped in my blanket. He will have he paws pressed up against me and kicks me when he‚Äôs having dreams. I usually will place my hand on him and he then stops kicking but he‚Äôs still passed out.
I have that blanket :)

Is she a Dogo Argentino?
OMG I have that same blanket.
Lol aww, that tail must be a good fan for you.
That's legitimately my Chihuahua when I tell him to go find mommy. His but will shake so hard that his body moves then he takes off to find my mom. Worst part is he goes to the bathroom first lmao!
Its light activated

Unrelated, but my parents have the same blanket.
My daughter loves peekaboo and dogs. Have my upvote

Yo I know that bedspread where is it from
The tail wags!
For those of you who have asked, I got the comforter at Ollie's Bargain Outlet. I'm not sure where it was originally sold.

So many of these comments are from people who have this same comforter. Of course I knew that other people must have it too, I just never really thought about it. Someone else posted a picture of theirs and it was so weird to see. Now I feel like we're all in some kind of club together.

There is nothing more comfortable than napping with a crotch-dog.  Once my dog nestles in, falls asleep and breathes rhythmically‚ÄîI‚Äôm out like a light in 30 seconds.
No love greater in the world...
Dogs are the best
BE STILL MY HEART
My dog does this too...I always wonder if he stops wagging his tail because I hurt his feelings covering his face
Well, you did it. My heart literally melted.

For my dog. That wagging means you have a big chance of getting a lickbite in your face which is ever more increasing everytime I'd open the blanket.
