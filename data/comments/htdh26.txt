There it is. The cutest thing I’ll see on reddit today.
Damn screen not letting you pet the fuzzy fuzz
That’s the cutest fucking thing I’ve ever seen in my life
That’s the most rabbit looking rabbit I’ve ever seen! Rabbit🐰🥕
He's so cute standing like that
^(monch monch)
like a living plushtoy
That's stupidly cute
My in-laws, who were in their 70's at the time, used to grow a vegetable garden that covered about five acres and included everything from corn to potatoes to zucchini. They also had fruit trees and other succulent plants in close proximity to a pond. They would get up at sunrise every day (if it wasn't raining) and they would weed until breakfast time. They would eagerly anticipate the harvest, but the corn was always devoured by the deer, the zucchini by a rogue bunch of rabbits (who knew?) and the fruit by flocks of crows. When asked why they bothered to plant and tend such a huge garden, my father-in-law said that he felt obligated to make sure the deer had a well-balanced diet.
That looks like the definition of a bunny if I’ve ever seen one.
For a moment I thought it was a toy. So cute!
That is just stinking adorable. Wtf
Eating to become a big boi!
Look mummy, no hands!
Omg this is literally an anime bunny
I don’t know who he is but I love him
Yo Peter, we'res your jacket.
Oh to be a sweet lil baby standing underneath somebody's plants in the shade :)
i just want to kiss this baby
Awwwww. This is illegally cute! 
So gosh darn adorable, I want to pet them! Those teeny tiny ears...! 
Thank you so much for sharing, my day is brighter now :D
Me, a grown ass man, just said "Aww a baby rabbit. How cute." Reddit has changes me.
Soooo cute 😍
Omg this melted my heart thank you 🥺
This is the video I needed to see today!
My dad be like : “ this little bastard is eating my basilica!!! I’m gonna catch you and cook you with wine and mustard !!!”.
Be me, at 12 years old, with a French dad cooking 24h a day
So cute!
Ok. I have seen the cutest thing in the world.
This is so adorable it doesn’t even look real.  Awesome. Thanks for posting that. Love bunnies.
I just remembered my school days. I used to feed rabbits in my school and they were my best friends. Those were the days
Awe I want one 🥰
Nothing is cuter!

I thought it was CGI for a moment
u/vredditshare
That is some Disney sh*t right there.

Rabbit.
That looks like an animatronic bunny. My first though was that’s not real. How is it THAT cute!
We have found ourselves a [king bun](https://xkcd.com/1682/)
OMG, this fella looks exactly like the stuffed bunny I had as a kid.   


how much cute do you want? Yes
The floofiest of all bunnies!
Cute until he's eating every last leaf off your tomato plant.

Edit: wow odd turn of events, I actually backed over a bunny rabbit this morning heading to my garden.
The thing I like best about rabbits is that they’re so freaking cute they don’t even look real. Plus their personalities are like one big ball of rage and sass wrapped up in a stuffed animal.
Is nobody going to mention the horrid crime scene that is that tile job??
Hippity hoppity your garden’s my property

That thing is so cute that it doesn't even look real. I looks like it was made at Build-A-Bear.
That bunny has no business being that adorable!!
As a 34 year old man, I just made a sound I didnt think I could make.
Looks like it’s eating basil. Seasoned from the inside :). Just kidding very cute
Says "get some weed plants for me monch on"
Fat little bun.
Yo what kind of rabbit is this. I need one.
I would 100% believe it if I was told this is a puppet.
We all love the buns, don’t we.
I had a wild rabbit eat a 3 foot jackfruit tree. I was so mad but I couldn’t be mad at a bunny just doing its thing
I was having such a bad day. Felt like crying all day. This is the first thing that's excited me. Thank you for sharing ❤️
I'm highly allergic to rabbits. Like I can be shopping and brush up against something in the store with Angora in it and my eyes will be swelled shut for a week and I'll have hives for a month. Seeing stuff like this makes me so sad because I just want to pet the bun.
Blonde and *fluffy*
Carful with that. Little baby rabbits bellies arnt great at digesting greens until they are about 6 months old
Looking that cute, you could come eat my vegetable garden and I wouldn't even mind.
Awwww can he come snacky snack on my weeds?
Eating greens is a special treat. They make long ears and great big feet.
That is the most adorable little bunny I have ever seen
Such a cute little bun bun!! 🥕
Omg. The cutest rabbit ever seen.
Aww man this is killin me....

That bunny looks like a cute stuffed animal
This video is not long enough. It's criminal.
What a cute bunny. He looks like a toy.
Plot twist... the plant it’s eating is poisonous ☠️

Despite of all its dark corners, Reddit melts hearts. The ultimate agony.

Looks animatronic
Rabbits are cute as hell.
I don’t know why, but this is mildly terrifying.
Is it possible to keep outdoor garden rabbits or will they terrorize the vegetation?
If it wasn't moving, I'd think it's a plushy toy or something. This bunny looks too perfect.
No not the milk weed, that's what caterpillars use to turn into butterflies.
He’s perfect.
So cute~~~
Please to forgive... I just needed a small snackrel.
coooooote
No. Just no. This is too cute! I want one in my garden right now while I sip my coffee.

Oh..my..goodness how adorable
I have a bunch of those weeds in my yard and a rabbit to feed them to.  Why have I never tried.
Wait
This is exactly what I needed to see after seeing the public freak out video of the cartel, which led me down a rabbit hole on a Narco video subreddit of some seriously messed up shit. 

This adorable little bunny is a nice palette cleanser.
I firstly thought it was a duck, like the ears are the beak... I need to see a doctor or something ...
Thank you for making me smile.
This is definitely a deep fake that rabbit looks off.

Assuming it's a wild bunny, I've never seen one like that before! I've only ever seen the gray colored ones that don't look fluffy at all
u/dialganite- a cute bunny
Screw the rabbits. 

They'll eat anything in your garden. Half of vegetable flowers in our garden, this little rabbit prick would just cut in half and wouldn't even eat it. There's a whole grassy area he could go wild but no, this little asshole is in love with pumpkin flowers. So, all we have now are stems and leafs and no fruit. 

Cat time.
that rabbit looks more like a toy than a real rabbit.  way too cute
Oooooh myyy goddd I love this so much
u/vredditshare
Awwwwwwwwwww! I love this!!!!!!
😍😍😍😍😍
That literally doesn’t even look like a rabbit, it looks more like an actual moving fluffy toy rabbit!
The tortoise and the hare. One is large and slow and rocky. The other is small and fast and fluffy.

But they are as brothers, united in their quest to monch the succulents. 

MONCH ALL DA SUCCULENTS.
Normally i hate baby language like “snacky snack” but this, this is gold
u/vredditshare
I want that bunny in my life
How do they know what's safe to eat
This post is good.
Would a bunny ever eat a plant that is not safe for them?  How much worrying would a bunny owner have to do about back yard visits like this?
So adorable!
At this point might as well shutdown r/aww for the day. My heart can't take it.
u/vredditshare
but but /u/GallowBoob posted this a few hours before.
That was so rabbit like,  I had to double check and make sure it wasn't Disney rabbit cgi like.
I always thought the buns on kids' bankets and PJs was a stylized charicature... This is straight out of a Disney movie...

🥺
Are there even any nutrients in that?
A Plushy
Gosh that’s cute
Baby rabbits taste the best 🤤

Does anyone know what breed this bunny is?
Rabbit.
Bun bunz!
Why is this the only cute bunny I’ve ever seen
I had an orange Netherland Dwarf. Bought him at a rabbit show in Las Cruses NM. His dad was champion show rabbit. The one we got had what they refer to a "sooty ears" which meant he wasn't show quality but he was the cutest thing. I'd lay down and he'd sit on chest while I rubbed his cheeks and between his ears for hours if I'd keep it up. So we named him BWOT for Big Waste Of Time which wasn't complimentary or even accurate, since he had such a therapeutic calming effect on us. He lived in the house with us. Had his own hutch and litter box. Little dude lived to be nine years old and left hole a lot  bigger than a little rabbit when he left.
This is fine. I want to watch this forever.
So adorable😍
So u like ur snacks alive
Does this come with batteries?
Somebody water that tree. Damn.
Yeah that's so cute upvote.

Super jealous. The rabbits in my neighborhood do not eat the weeds they eat my lovingly cultivated plants....
It's sad to think that they take these little guys and turn them into chocolate to sell to us on Easter.
Guessing it is ok, but that rabbit is eating pokeweed which is considered poisonous. The leaves much less so, but the pokeberries are dangerous. The leaves can be eaten by humans, but only after blanching a few times to reduce the toxins.
Can we talk about the tile work? Like wth is going on
I have an urge to hug that rabbit.
Reddit has traumatized me so much I was expecting something to happen.

I wanted a bunny soooo bad but then I heard from someone that bunnies have really strong Urine Smell and the smell won’t go away for weeks. Is this true or something someone made up to deter people from buying bunnies.
That is actually the cutest thing I have ever seen
I'm terrified of all rabbits, except for this one.

This is why invented bullets
*reloads sniper rifle*
I'm stunned  that this short 14 sec video of an animal which very few people give a damn about and either eat or hunt or allow to die in their countless numbers every year , has made the front page.   I have a similar video of a rabbit takinga crap which may be of equal interest to the world.

I feel either we're all desperate for something sweet or we're all moronic simpletons and hypocrites.

Either way this is super cute despite being one of the lowest effort videos I've seen on reddit.  I guess im grateful that something so innocuous Is still popular amongst all the dross and tragedy.
