# Translation:

**Biker**: No. There's a little kitty in the middle of the road. This is a joke?

**Man in car**: I saw that.

**Biker**: Yes yes.

**Man in car**: Stop.

**Biker**: No. Come here, you. Come. Little one (lou lou), what are you doing here? Oh, little one.

**Man in car**: What to do with him?

**Biker**: I don't know. I've picked him up here but unfortunately I'm allergic. But well, I can't leave him here.

**Man in car**: What to do with him?

**Biker**: What's wrong my little one? Come.

**Man in car**: We've gotten lost, huh?

**Biker**: Lost or he was left here. How else could he have gotten here?

**Man in car**: Give him to me.

**Biker**: You'll take him? Oh thank you, sir.

**Man in car**: Oh la la la la la...

**Biker**: Oh, he's stuck. Gently.

**Man in car**: Says something unintelligible -> You don't see his mother or something, right?

**Biker**: Well, it's strange that he's out here in the middle of nowhere. Oh, he's so cute.

**Man in car**: More la la la la la

**Biker**: Yes, it's fine. Thank you so much.

**Man in car**: I won't throw him in the ditch.

**Biker**: Well no. Have a good day, goodbye.

**End.**

This is how I ended up with my newest cat. Jack https://imgur.com/gallery/tb94aql
Oh my God his "non!" at the beginning is so frantic and got me in the heart.
oh petit chaton, je vais te ramener à la maison avec moi!
r/humansbeingbros
All righty then. Where all the frenchies at to translate this! I wanna know what the saviours said!
You can definitely see the relief on the poor kitten’s face after being rescued. Humans are the best at being bros!!
I fucking love that French people actually say "Ohhh la la" constantly
Thats one scared baby. Merci kind men.
This is the first video ever that made me say: awww.

After that i realized i am on r/aww and i have to give this sub more love than my last year on Reddit. 

Came here via the front-page.

Edit: spelling
My eyes are sweating
"That hunkering down right in the roadway shit is not for everyone but it usually works."
Not one but TWO good humans!
This is what the internet was made for. Definitely didn’t cry at all
The motorcyclist is allergic.

The motorist agrees to adopt the cat.
Went to my first AA meeting today. Detoxing while I lower my alcohol intake. Fiancee and family are proud of me. I've done my best to not be emotional or let alcohol kick my ass today.

And then I see this video. Thanks for making a 32yo man cry due to empathy, reddit lol
I'm not crying
I bet its heart was just vibrating from fear alone.
The bike guy sounds like he’s from Belgium so they might not be French
I'm convinced that kittens have this as a weird adapted survival technique:

Put yourself in a dangerous predicament and some nice person finds you a good home. 

Or you get run over. 

But then reproductive strategies are always about gambles.
That makes me want to go adopt a cat.

Which is crazy because I really don't want a cat.
Basic translation:

Biker: No! There's a kitten in the middle of the road. This has to be a joke!

Biker: (To the cat) Come here you. What are you doing here?

Biker: (To the other guy) I'd take him from here but unfortunately I'm allergic. But I can't leave him here.

Other Guy: (To the cat) Did you get lost?

Biker: Either he's lost or someone abandoned him. How could he find himself here?

Biker: (To the other guy) Will you take him? Thank you very much sir.

Biker: Its bizzare that he's just here, in the middle of everything. Oh, he's so cute

Biker: Alright, thank you so much, have a good day, bye

&#x200B;

I could barely hear what the older dude was saying it just sounded like gibberish.
Poor baby, such scared eyes. Lovely he was saved ❤️
I really hope one of them gave that cat a good home, it looked so scared!
The way that kitten is looking at the biker is absolutely tearing my heart up
I think this is the Youtuber who saved it: https://youtu.be/IktOSAlL5so
Cute cat ! Poor thing really looked in despair.

Kudo to you both !
*by two Belgian guys

Omg that little kitty is a rush of oxytocin
[deleted]
Ohhhhh lah lah lah lah lah
My favorite thing is the 《ohhhh lalalalalalalala》's by the older man I can't.

But the bikers "non!" Sounded so frantic i feel for him so deeply , jggciy
This makes me really happy after recent events.   
I saw a kitten on a 70mph highway a few months ago, but sadly by the time I had turned around and got to him he had been hit and killed instantly. I still decided to take him home and bury him in my back yard, he didn't deserve to be left on the side of the road by himself.  
Sorry I couldn't save you little buddy.
Good effort, but I'm pretty sure cats only understand English.
They're not French, they're Belgians
Guy: “Guess I have a cat now”

Cat: “Works every time”
This makes me so sad.. I saw a kitten get hit by a car 2 weeks ago. And all it’s brothers and sisters were sitting there sniffing it. And I went and told the people who owned them.. I ended up driving it to the Vet ER to be put down :(
Awww sweet baby!
Who gets the kitty
Where is the rest of the kitten’s family?!
When people sprint as fast as they can for something important to them it gets me really choked up to the point of tears. 

Children running towards their parents after coming home from serving abroad does the same thing to me.
Looks like he really wanted to stay with the motorcycle guy.
What a great human
Guy is like "Woah theres a cat in the middle of the road, is this a joke?"
"come here you, little lou lou what are you doing here" He said he would take it but he is allergic.
OMFG. My soul left the planet when I saw how tiny the cat was and hearing the guy yell “stop!” Wow ❤️
[removed]
Little kitty gave the motorcyclist the friendly blink, I think he was grateful to be rescued.
Those eyes... That poor thing was sooo scared...
That little baby looked terrified. I'm so glad he was rescued. Good people.
I did the same thing in the fdr drive in NYC. Saved little Franklin
I like it very much when people respect and care for every life equally,weather it is beneficial for them or not.
This is almost exactly how I got my cat. Hand waving running in front of cars and everything lol.
Not all humans are garbage.
Fucking bless you. That look on the lil guys face. Glad he’s okay.
This kitten looks like the kitten I just fostered and I'm tearing up just thinking about lil Tatertot's French cousin being rescued by these kind men.
Lulu is her name now, that's all i understood.
Glad to see that there are people like those out there.
kitten looks like he understands what's going on eventually, and then feels really bad, like he was in the wrong spot and now he knows not to be there. When Guy 2 (pronounced Gee lol) starts to pet him he looks really scared, like he's gonna be in trouble with his mama. But he got lifted up high by humans, and then he could see what was going on. Cats learn by observation. They learn to use litter box by watching mama cat. Kitty learned a lot this day.
I find it interesting that Stop has become a universal word.
Also, I hope the asshole who threw that kitten on the road roasts in hell, because how else did it get there?
My girlfriend and I recently saved a kitten from the middle of a motorway. Poor little guy was shaking with fear. We've been taking good care of the little fella, named him Dante. He's a little badass now ha
Kitten says "and that was the day that I was saved by Daft Punk."
Fuck world politics, I will vote for any person who's platform is pro kitty cat.
The way the cat looks at him after he picks it up..am not a cat person but that got me.
*Achievement Unlocked: Fuckin' Legend.  New Companion Available to Recruit at HQ: Sherbet, Level 1 Cat-Bard.*
His face just says "fucking hell mate, you see this shit?
We are bombarded with so much bad news everyday, it's so nice to see some good.
I will sleep good tonight thank you.
We can do this. All of the problems in the world, we can solve them. We just need to harness this side of ourselves.
Something like this happened to me a couple months ago except the kitten was crossing the road and got hit by a u-haul truck. I slammed on my brakes and chased the kitten down before he jumped off the 100ft bridge he was on out of fear. I caught him at the last moment to realize he only suffered a busted lip from the uhaul impact, I am allergic to cats, but luckily someone at my dads work was nice enough to take the cat in and pay its vet bills. The cat and owner are now happy together.
oo do this to you moncla?
Scared kitten!

**^(COME WITH ME IF YOU WANT TO LIVE!)**
I just went and gave my cat a hug.
So it really happens?  How come I never find petite chatons dans la rue when I am driving!!!!!! No fair.
He looks like my sweet boy, Frank!
You have been chosen. Congrats on your new cat, French guy #2.
Faith in humanity restored!
John wick strikes again, good on you Baba Yaga
Great job guys thank you both
2 guys 1 cat.
Love these kind of posts
I'm sure the cat was instantly put at ease by the strange spaceman that picked him up.
ugh, my brovaries...
Its always the bikers that are so nice
Feel good post if the day
Definitely abandoned on the side of the road. Poor thing.
This is the cutes thing i've seen in a while.. love you guys..
That poor little kitty. His eyes were dilated with fear.
Holy shit that kitten is a cutie
Awesome!  What wonderful people for being so caring to that poor little thing.
This warms my heart. I know the dude will never see this but I’m thankful he saved an innocent kitten. Thank you for being a good human being
This got me right in the heart. Such nice men helping a precious kitty.
Both of those men looked like they wanted to keep the kitty. Haha. Sooooo adorable.
I wonder if when the biker rushed to the cat the driver didn't have a split second where he thought the biker was rushing him
I read this as scared guy gets saved by two french cats.
My wife and I have rescued two cats and brought them in permanently. If you're not willing to do the same for the betterment of humanity, you're a schmuck.
The kitten was already sending "i like you" blinks to the motorcycle guy. Very trusting kitty and socialized to humans already. Would like to know where kitty ends up!
"I was there on the road hoping to get picked up by a servant and this spaceman comes and finds me first. It was then I realized there were some faults that had to be worked out with our feline forced adoption policies of showing up where we want to live." - Monsieur Mittens.Fluffy.Bottom Boucher
Something similar happened to me in college. It was move in weekend of my junior year and my parents and I were going out to grab dinner. We were on a main highway when we saw people getting out of their cars and chasing an orange kitten. Kitten ended up underneath our car as we stopped. I ran out and got under the car and grabbed the little fella. He’s 5 years old now and I love him to pieces
Mais la la le petite Chat
I sincerely hope mama cat hasn't been run over and the little ones are simply trying to find her after missing for so long.... If there wasn't anywhere to hurry I'd have checked at least the side bushes but I get it's a daunting task ofc. Poor little creature. Really glad most people instinctively react in this manner regardless of who they are. <3
My optical sensors started leaking clear fluid. Do I I have problems with some servos?
Why does the cat look French
For those of you who don't speak French, I believe the car owner said something along the lines of, "no no no, I would be happy to take him home.  There is a rat in my kitchen and I can think of no better way to deal with the problem."
Kindness knows no country or language.
Every time I lose faith in humanity, humanity fights back.
Thank you for this.
Not all heroes wear capes
Aw.. poor kitty! I'm sure it's in good hands now.
Those cars weren't beep but he was beep

Good eyes on the motorcyclist.  I missed him the first two times I watched it.
Omg my heart☺️😊💚
I’m allergic to cats but I would still take it

Such a keen eye for the motorcyclist. I didn’t even see the little guy.
Awe chitty maine
Precious little baby ❤
Le cat save
Poor little dude. You can tell it was thankful to be taken off the road
I needed this right now. Those little eyes where so full of love and admiration.
i wonder what the people driving up after the fact thought. 

"whatre these two weirdos doing petting a cat in the road"

nah this was cute as fuck though.
Le mew le mew
I love seeing humanity.  We as a society are so deprived of simple sweet things like this and its amazing to see. Sorry to get all deep. Orange cats are the best !!
The cat looks so terrified, I'm feeling guilty not being able to do anything
Thank you guys  for that amazing save love the French and your beautiful country thanks for sharing
I am soo happy that the cat is ok. 
It makes me happy when people save animals ❤️
Medals. All the medals
Now name him garson and care for him for the rest of his days. Oui.
Oh that poor cat! I hope maybe the older guy was able to keep him
Un chat.

did someone dump their cat in the middle of nowhere?
I’m crying this is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
I would name it  Splat
He is so cute
Now we battle to see who keeps this lil cutie
We need more people like this in the world
Merci merci merci!
That is one of the cutest kittens I’ve ever seen!
Two weeks ago I saw something similar to this but with a much worse ending. I can’t get the image out of my head. But watching this video is helping me so much. Now when that event starts playing in my head, I’ll think of this one instead.
You’ve been chosen
Omg.. can we get part 2 him in loving home and living it up?!!
Anyone else think of that little French mouse that hung out with Jerry.

Ello Misyoor poooseee cat!
Aww. He’s so scared! 

I want to hold and hug him and protect em!

Whoever did this is worse than satan!
What beautiful people.

Save him and love him forever.
OMG, I'm in love with those 3 right now.

I'm pretty sure these guys are belgians. 
 
 As a fellow french speaking belgian, I recognize those accents from wallonia !
Why does everybody but me seem to find a kitten?
These two are Heroes!
It was a race to be the hero
Usually, these kinda lost cats hiss or a scratch, but this one just looked really anxious. It must have been terrified
His voice though.
So weird, French people wearing shorts and driving cars just like normal people
LE aww......
We are super lucky that the dude wearing the camera was the one to pick the kitty up.
u/jenmsft
I hope this cat speaks French
The look in the cats eyes when it’s rescued! 🥺
Now I also wanna see the biker. Sounds so attractive b/c he's gentle, sweet, and caring. He ran so quickly to save the kitten!
You know the Earth keeps revolving for the sake of these kind of people.
How do I upvote more then once😭
Little cat terrified, those eyes. I am so happy it was saved by these kind hearted people.
Aliens will judge us by how we treat the beings around us.

Why do animals do this?
I need to hug it. I need to hold it. I need to let it know that it’s safe.

We need more of this. The News tries to convince me that we have no redeeming qualities as a society and yet things like this happen everyday in every country around the world.
This just melted my ❤😥
Oh my God! Those are Two GOOD SOULS to quickly STOP & save that baby kitty. The cat looked totally confused.
I love that kitty, I will travel anywhere to take the sweet orange fluff
Nobody thought to label this "**Scaredy cat gets saved by two French guys"?**
French guy on a motorcycle saving a kitten? That's a panty-dropper.
Thus begins a life long quest of this kitten!  Why did she abandon him?  What will become of him?  Will he find his mother, or will his adoptive human abandon him too, when he is no longer a cute kitten?  So many questions.. Tune in next time for .... La vie du Petit  Chaton
I usually don’t have reactions to heartwarming reddit posts but this one really killed me, poor kitty
Jeez, are you kitten me?! That could have been a CATastrophe!
Not just any cat, either. That's basically a kitten just short of being fully grown.

Those guys are heroes.
Oh my heart
Do cats understand French and American? Source: I’m a typical American.
Maybe it was trying to end it all. 

Mr. Meowgi didn't want to be saved, Mr. Meowgi didn't asked to be saved!
911 why dont i see him drive past the car at the beginning
2 people from different walks of life joining to save a little kitty. Awwww
Sometimes life leaves you little gifts such as this video and the kitten for the motorists. ❤️
I love the French language. It’s sounds so soothing when spoken correctly. I’ve spent 6 years learning it and can say about 2 sentences though.
Most excellent!!
Is it just me or does that cat look French too?
There is, after all, good in the world.
Cat!? That’s a bloody month old kitten at best. These guys are legends.
I love cats too much.
Awww so sweet. Almost made me cry
The French people are so cool.
The older man then realized after he had stepped into the car that this was a job for two. He stepped out, called after the motorcyclist, and they rented out an apartment to raise this kitten as their own. Together.
This video reminds me all the times I saw dead cats on the side of the street. I'm so glad this one is still with us <3
*meows in french*
I kissed the screen!! Shit!!
Not one, but two random people stopped immediately. I don't know these guys, but I love them!
I want to see the TV series where these two men become best friends and move in together ala Odd Couple and raise the kitty together always babying the kitty but constantly verbally jousting with each other in French.
Looks like, based on some digging on the Youtubers fb page that the kitty was taken to a rescue and has no small amount of people who would be interested in taking her. So, yay!
This is how I got my Beatrice, her tail was hanging on by a thread (we think she got thrown out of the car).... she is happy, hilarious and my best friend a year later!

My cats French...

He weewees all over the house.
I was in this same situation with a turtle once. That feeling when you see a car coming as you're trying to get to the animal is terrifying and you really hope you're not about to see an animal be obliterated in front your own eyes.
That's the most French looking cat I've ever seen
You made my heart beat too hard.
Vive La France! It’s good to see the best parts of humanity on display. (I know that there are many complex and horrifying problems, but it is wonderful to see strangers working together to save such a vulnerable entity from a brutal and useless demise.)
L’a French 🥺
Keep it. Name it.

Love it god dammit
Thank god it had a good ending. Idk what goes through a kitties head but I’ve seen this happen before. Saw a kitty sit in the middle of a freeway exit and wouldn’t move. Maybe it was injured, but was wondering if it thought that was safest course of action just to freeze. So scary.
Not all, but some, heroes ride motorcycles
No, honey, I’m not crying. I just put some freedom drops in my eyes!
Christ I want to just reach through the screen and adopt that mofo.
I have rescued many a lost/abandoned kitty like this. Most got homes. One lost one of her front legs, probably twisted off by contact with a car wheel moving at high speed. She survived. She is now my “Velcro kitty “. Sticks to me like I’m made of Velcro. 
Never ignore a helpless creature. There’s always some kind of rescue organization that can help, if you don’t have the means.
I feel like they could've looked a little harder for the mother but good job otherwise.
Awwwww awesome last post to view before sleep. Going to pet my cats in appreciation that they're safe and loved
This is a good man. He was already in his cat handling gear. He must be doing this regularly.
Cat is scared shitless
always save kittens IN N E E D!
Welp. You know the rules. You it’s daddy now.
Two strangers randomly bonding over a roadside kitten. Wholesome.
I picked up a cat exactly the same way. Became a real cuddly bastard.
Like he's always saying :
 'thanks for saving me but i' m still a motherflippin cat! Miauw Miauw Miauw'
Really made my day, this video.
I love the French language. It really does sound kinda romantic.
2 months ago i came to a similar situation. On my way to work while crossing one boulevard i stumbled upon a little kitty ( approx same size as this one) . It was green light for me and the cars were waiting but between them was the little cutie running scared. So i went between the cars and tried to catch it. It kept running from me and going under and behind the cars. The green light turned for them and i was trying to give them a sign not to run over the fella. In the end the cat got between the rims of one car. Thank god the driver paid attention to me while i was waving and shouting not to go, otherwise the kitty would've been gone. Unfortunately i couldn't take it home, i just released it in front of one building where there was other homeless cats ( like 4-5). The people are feeding them daily. Every few days on my way to work i see the little kitty there, now grown up.
Based on the title I thought this was a porno
:')
This cat will love leather gloves for the rest of its life.
The cat even looks French.
Why are biker dudes so nice?
The cat clearly doesn’t speak French
My heart is melting. So sweet!
He runs like an ultra high guality fps game lmfao
This legit made me cry. That poor little baby would have been terrified. So thankful for good humans. I wonder where her mumma and siblings are? I hope they are ok :( 

You just know the man in the car wanted to straight up adopt that kitty. It was love at first sight. I wish them all the cough snuggles in the world ♡
What about of cat? Where is he now?
Proof that good people exist in this world.
I needed to see this. Thank you.
New best friends!!! I'm CRYYYYYIING!!!
PANTIES DROPPED💕I saw a guy save a turtle and would’ve jumped him right then. This, right here, is how you get the girls.
Not frenchmen, but french speaking Belgians: accent and registration plate on car.

Glad they rescued the little one!
I really don’t like cats but it’s just cruel leaving a cat on the road like that. 

How can people who do this sleep at night?
I hate cats but this gives me the crazy cat feels. I think I love cats suddenly. How did this happen?
So sweet!!!! Crying buckets!!!

But... motorcycle guy has a “dash cam” in his helmet?! That’s super cool!
That older dude was totally "my le kat now, oui."
French cat says mieux

That is soooooo very nice!!!! Cute
Awww
Did I just watch a French porn?
Their voices, so caring and soothing.  Love conquers fear.
First-world reaction in a first-world setting where people stop their vehicles to help out with something.

In other countries, this kind of thing is done on purpose by thieves to jump out of the bushes and steal a vehicle.

Those guys did a nice thing, but it would have been foolish in other circumstances.
Aww how sweet
Youre always told go leave wild animals where you find them bur what do you do in this situation? Of course you move the kitten but do you simply place on the side of the road and hope the mom will get it?
Awwww
I love it when humans go completely out of their way for the little ones.
Did they became DJ's after this?
Precious
Why didn’t they fight over who keeps the kitten😭
They do speak French, but they're actually Belgian.
What heros!
CRAZY YOU GOT THIS ON VIDEO!
He was probably only nice to it because it spoke French
Good men!!
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
Plot twist : the rest of the kitten's family are stealing the motorbike
♥
What people are supposed to do!
This is so cute and makes me happy
Tres heartwarming ♥️
I’m sobbing
I love these guys!!
My heart! 🤗
Looks like the kitty instantly bonded with the biker.
I had Many Meetings from Lord of the Rings playing while watching this, and it suited it very well.
Hon hon
I've only had to do this once in my life, thankfully, with a slightly older kitten.  Little fellow literally jumped into my car after I pulled over and opened my door; just just wanted to be with someone.  Turned out he'd gotten chased out of his yard by another cat, panicked, and got lost. (The little guy had a microchip).  Was quickly returned to the owner.
I think the older guy said he would take him home or something
I read the title as "scardy cat"
I think the kitten was a little unsure about being rescued by Daft Punk.

Super sweet people! I’m always happy to see kind people stopping to help animals 😍
Not all heroes wear capes
Love thissss
Lucky little kitty
Magnifique!
was fully prepared to dislike these guys. 100% guys right here tho

Poor lil guy
This is one of those rare moments where I actually like people and I think there might actually be hope for hoomans.
Please, save every cat, kitten, doggy, puppy and all the helpless ones. I feel this way seriously. This is great that they protected it but I feel so much more sad about the ones we don't know about. 

This is my rant: when will madness end, the cruelty to  animals, all the reports we know about and people that post their cruelty online. Yes those people need help most of them but to the heartless I don't know what's the best way for you to stop hurting others. 

Sorry for my rant.
I want to be reincarnated in a universe that is based on this video.
I have never not cried at one of these road rescue videos. Bless these Frenchies.
I love orange tabby cats.
Tres bein, meri

I just started crying he looks so much like one of my girls
That’s too me! My little black cat was saved on the side of a main French road. She’s scared of everyone except me. Love my little Squeaky.
OhAwwww, so sweet. I didn't understanding anything they said except for *merci beaucoup*.  However, I understood everything **they did**. 

You French guys ROCK!
I did something similar not long ago.  Little kitten ran up into a cars undercarriage at a red light during high traffic.  Pretty sure I freaked out the other driver since I basically dove out of my car saying no over and over again frantically lol.

Kitten was saved.  I suffered burns and a few bites... He was super tiny, scared and bit the hell out of me at one point, but he has a happy home now
Im cryingggg
Even though the title showed this ended happily, I was still holding my breath until he had safely grabbed the kitten.

Then I watched it a second time because I didn't spot the kitten on the road the first time, and realized I was holding my breath all over again.

Well done these two guys.
Literally a rescued Cat
I hope the Eric Clapton looking french guy with a heart of gold took care of her well.
omg , the cats are alive , i'm happy now :)!!!
They are belgian lol
I fully read this as “scared cat gets shaved by two French guys” - was expecting a very different outcome
And that’s how you get a cat.
Cat was like "WTF are these guys saying" ;-p
Kitten in motorcycle jacket sounds awesome
they must not be french canadians, if they were theres no doubt in my mind they would have ran over the cat and reversed for good measure
Found one almost exactly like that 15 years ago.  Named him "Freeway".
speechless...

This was lovely

The kitty is terrified... he doesn’t speak French.
Oh hey, French guys!
Z1000?
Oh my god the poor thing!
Judging from their accents they are Belgian, not French.

I am a terrible person but whenever I see animals in such situations it just makes me tear up, as my mom used to always tell me "if he had a farm he would bring in all the stray animals". Poor kitty :(
Merci. Thank you for saving the little ginger guy.
Things like this always make my eyes water and my throat do that one thing it does when you’re trying not to cry
Merci beaucoup!
The motorcyclist has such a calming voice.  You can here the compassion in it.  What wonderful human beings those two men are.
I love you.
It's in Belgium not in France (accent) and The old Guy is joking at the end of the video telling the biker that he gonna throw the cat afterwards.
Why I'll always dig two-wheelers, even if motored. 

Any car would have passed over the kitty, most likely killing him in the process, coz the vehicle's basically a 5-6 foot wide box of steel running at fast speeds. Animals on the road are far easier to avoid with motorbikes, scooters and bicycles.
oh my god this kitty hes the cutest "thank you good sir"-look  


okay i am gonna but those onions away now sorry for that
This got me awww'ed almost to tears.
The rules of Reddit are it has to be adopted by one or both extra points if they get married
Was the motorcyclist riding a Kawasaki Z series? My Z900 looks exactly the same from his perspective.

Didnt understand a bit of what they were saying but damn, those gentle pats of affection and cat's face of relief says it all. I cried.
Rescued the meow
Great video... Assuming that was direct footage, I'm amazed at how good the stabilization is! It's so smooth.
Fast reaction. I spend the next 5km, before I turn around, thinking "ah I should have turned back, but now I'm even further... ah I should have..."
That kitty just won the lottery :)

So nice to see.
So beautiful 😍
This restores faith in mankind. Thank you..
Nice French lucky cat
Sexiest thing ever.
OMG...I’m a cynical bastard , but that was the cutest thing ever
r/humansbeingbros
Awww
Pls tell me he took that cat into his home
Awww! So cuteeeee
We need more kindness in the world, these two men are the kindness that little cat needed that day and they should be proud.  


I remember reading a small "study" done a few years ago where they put a fake turtle (might have been another animal) on the side of the road and then they would watch drivers and see what they would do. I can't remember the exact numbers but they witnessed quite a few drivers intentionally leave the road to run the animal over.
 Bravo!
Heroes. True heroes
Awesome!
Does anyone else find the biker's voice magnetic?

^(No, just me?)
Alala les français ont est tellement parfait
Oh gosh, I absolutely love these types of videos
That face
man that fear in the eyes is trippy

I'm not overly religious but I believe I just repeated a lifetime's worth of "Oh my God" just now.  I'd go back and add punctuation but there are so many tears in my eyes i cant even see right now,
OmG how he didn’t get hit is beyond me. And that look on his little face
ay aye plair i'll take care of this thank you.
Le mew. Le purrrrr.
If it was only that easy to find kitties in my area.
Mercy beaucoup indeed my dudes, mercy beau fucking coup.
This video is exactly what I needed today. I’m glad that poor cat didn’t feel any pain and got some pets instead
/u/vredditshare
I wanna be saved by two french, too   


they sound soothing
Waiting for the "helped rescue a cat in the road. Reddit, meet 'Trouver'! (Lucky Find)" post...
There is some hope for humanity.
Precious.
Softcore Henry
I would hate it if someone just left it there to die.
!remindme
Poor mama cats looking from the bushes goin "lost another one"
Omg the cuteness
i dont get why such a small kitten was out in the middle of the road without its parent or any other cats near by
widepeepohappy
Oh. That's a cute animal
I did this about 2 months ago (although I was on foot), when 2 dogs got away from a dog walker who thought it was smart to walk like 8 dogs and then let them all off-leash to swim in a nearby creek.

Of course about 3 dogs ran off into the nearby highly-trafficked 4 lane road (2 lanes each way), and one proceeded to get hit right in front of me despite my desperate attempts to stop traffic.

I then spent another 40 minutes with another passerby trying to find that dog, which we did, and then called the doggie's owner to take them to the emergency room right away.

Fuck stupid dog walkers. You can only handle as many animals as you can deal with in an emergency, and 8 dogs off leash is plain idiocy. I'm still raging angry when I think about it.

Glad the cat was ok though! Good folks. Actually my cat looks like that kitty.
😵 Le CHAAAAAT!!!!!
Good humans. Kitty looked so scared,  sweet thing...
What’s up with all those icons next to op’s bame
Aww this is really heartwarming thank God they're still good people out there 😊❤️
🔥Hit the like button if you’d dab for that cats safe new home 🔥
Aww
Most heartwarming thing I've seen today!
Aaaawwww orange kittens are always the cutest
Bless these fine men!
Thank god for people like that :)
I can't stop thinking about this:

I'm sad and happy at the same time. It's strange
Nuuhh~
It's amazing how quickly they worked together
Can someone translate?
These guys are angels.


God, I wish I was rich right now so I could reward them
So that's how you get cats.
my heart is beating so fast watching this video 😨
Awwww!!!!! I love this with everything I am! And I’m not even a cat person, but this just made me straight up cry
I'm legit crying right now, it's so sweet.
What if he picked him up and he looked like that "MA there's a weird fucking cat out here" and it just scared the shit out of him.
"Le Meow"

~~~The cat probably
I read. "Scared cat gets shaved by two french guys".
They did it guys!
His dialect of french is very beautiful and he sounds so posh haha. I could listen to French people talk all day
Je suis un homme that’s all I got
Cat pro tip... This wasnt an accident. This is how stray cats decide to be worshiped by humans. They lay in the road and whatever saves them will do their bidding forever.
Ah, a Lichtenstein fan, I see.
this made my day
humanity saved!
That first no from the biker was such a genuine human sound.
Major "Puss in Boots" closeup moments there. So glad there is a happy ending for the little guy.
This makes me feel good. 👍🏼
Maybe the cat wanted to commit die
What a nice guy
Why that cat look like his name is Réjean?
oui oui baguette
That looks like the cat I had growing up. He was a good boy.
Le Chat Oranj
There are people like me all over the globe.
That kitty doesn't understand one bit of French
I love how after the first two people stop, the next person they wave to slow down stops and waits until they see that the situation is handled.
Thank you for this
Fuck off, the look on little dudes face...I'm not crying...ugh...im glad this ended up ok
Cat would have been fine with either French guy, I think.
They’re from Belgium though, not France.
Hahahahaha 😂🤣
This made me so happy!!!!!!!
That kitty so scared!
Thank you
I always wondered if I came across this scenario with another person.. who would take the cat? Would they be upset if I took it? What if they have been wanting a cat? Oh gosh the anxiety
So, guy with the care keeps the cat.  Happy ending for both. 

 :-)
Sooo little!! Thank God for such kind people
I prolly woulda stole car, niet!
gotta love that its always a European on a motorcycle that does stuff like this, wonder if it's the same dude in all the videos
The reason kitty was hiding was pepe le pew was close. Watching her from the brush..
Kitten looks confused in English.. not sure what they are planning for me, but doesn’t sound like they are going to eat me.
/r/HumansBeingBros
“What the fuck. You saw what almost happened to me right? Jesus! I owe you a big fat mouse when you get me back home!”
Aw, poor scared baby. What MONSTER threw this poor kitty out the window!?
It looked like they were about to fight on who will keep him
Respect!
Lol this species has literally taken over the planet with its cuteness

Such an adorable video awww
Those are good people
Nope, I’m not high and crying over this. Nope, not at all.
Aww, poor little guy
If only humans showed as much kindness to each other
I wish someone would save me like that.
The fact he’s allergic and still goes out of his way to save a creature he can be allergic to and treat it so gently says a lot about this bro’s character.
I like that the rider checked his left at 1:35. That’s a habit I picked up and still do even while grocery shopping haha
I'm laying in bed with tears in my eyes and my orange cat asleep on my lap. This is so sweet. Warms my heart
Old Orchard Beach Maine?
Faith in people temporarily restored.
Good hoomans, help the meow
My limited remembrance of high school French: "cat in the road"
That’s a real Puss In Boots face if I ever saw one.
Those are too luxurious for my guys.
Wow that's so nice. You have just saved the life of a small kitty...
Please please please please please name it “Roadkill” the Cat #neverforget
Bruh. Ok. I needed that. Thank you, internet!
Captain meowskasis!!
A Frenchman on a motorcycle stopping to save a kitty? There’s the proof that my dream man exists.
Sitting here listening to sleep deprivation by simian mobile disco and thought the motorcyclists voice was part of the song lmao. Super cute.
I love men like this.
So cute
He has 2 dads now.
fuck im so sad and happy
I very much wish the guy on the bike had been able to take him, I trust him much more for some reason.
i want someone to tell me what the hell happened to this cat i hope it’s okay and in a good family
I stopped my car on Sherman Way in the valley during rush our because I saw a baby Grey kitty. I got out to help him but he was scared and at the edge of the lane. 

A giant lifted truck zoomed past my car and ran the kitty over right in front of me. I was fucking horrified and it still bothers me 4 years later. I wish I could’ve saved him and I hate that speeding truck
Poor little kitty!!!  :(  Good on the guys for saving it though :)
Love this! When people stop their busy lives for the sake of animals I am reminded that there are good people out there!
This cat clearly does not speak French.
His "no!" at the beginning. ohmygod he sounded so scared for the kitty :(

Got me cryin
My heart has melted.
I wish there an update how's the cat doing these days.
Awww! Such a little cutie!
Everyone liked that
It is luuurve, mon cherie. Yes, no, no, yes?
Faith in humanity restored （＾∇＾）
Kittens will do anything to get picked up and taken.
