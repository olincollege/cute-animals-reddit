The pose is the same! Good girl!
Oh wow!!!! You did a fabulous job! She is glorious. You must be very proud of her...and you should be. A very happy ending, for the end of the year.
Amazing what love and care can do.
Looks so healthy and obviously won the lottery with you.

Beautiful
She's adorable! Your kitty bears a striking resemblance to my big guy: https://imgur.com/v0j7HC9.jpg
Wow she looks wonderful
I would love to see a link to the original post with the backstory 😸
I love you. Thank you for the update. This makes me so happy
What a glow up!
She looks so good! 

Round of applause for how much care you gave her, she looks so happy and much, much healthier.
She's so cute and healthy and I'm glad she still does the feets thing.
What a beautiful cat!
So amazing that she got a second chance at life and looks like she’s thriving and healthy! I hope you guys have a great cat family and tons of happiness <3

Also it really brightened my day seeing this. So thank you very much cause depression sucks and you made me smile
Well nurtured catloaf you have there, what a cutie
Good hooman!  Also, r/feetsies....or is it r/curledfeetsies?
Sweet baby!
Kyra Queen already touched the upvote button.
So cute!
Those pics made my heart lurch.  My own sweet girl was in a similar mess when we found her, and she turned into the most beautiful, elegant girl too.  We lost her last year.  My heart will always be a little broken now, but I regret nothing.  It's funny, people used to say how good we were for rescuing her and how lucky she was... totally back-to-front, it's me who was lucky to have her.
Thanks op for reviving this beautiful creature ;)
I love that she still crosses her front legs
Face on the right looks like it’s asking “you deleted that really ugly photo of me when you first saw me, right?”
That is the most beautiful and amazing transformation I've seen in a while.
Oh my God, my heart is swelling, I'm so indescribably happy you guys didn't drop her off where she would be euthanized, and I'm so glad they told you that's what would happen. That sweet, precious, adorable, fearless face on that dirty baby and seeing her so big and gorgeous is making my cry like a baby right now. I want to give her so many kisses. Thank you for opening your heart and home for that little one 💛💛💛💛💛😭😭😭😭😭
She went from ashy to classy.
Kyra is beautiful and looks healthy and happy!  I love her!

Makes you wonder if rescue cats like this remember and look upon their past to realize how lucky and grateful they are.
She has progressed so well! You can see it in her eyes
She looks so beautiful, what a gorgeous kitty cat! I'm so happy Kyra turned out alright, you're awesome for reacuing her!
What a darling! I love how she folds her paws in together :)
r/curledfeetsies
Oh my god the original picture brings tears to my eyes. She's so lucky you rescued her. Pretty kitty.
Hip hip hooray!
So happy to see she's gotten all the love and care she needed!
Wow she is beautiful!
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Aww baby 😍😍😍

What an angel!!

Incredible. She looks perfect.
YAY! I'm glad to see she's happy!

Such a beautiful baby!!!!!

Good job OP. Thank you for being a great parent to Kyra.
Bravo

that's me rn
Omg
I love her
It's adorable how she crosses her paws in both photos.
Omg. So beautiful:)
Well done, human. Well done.
What a sweet face! You did a great job taking care of her!
She's so beautiful!
I love her 😭
Still the same curled feetsies!!
She looks so, polite.
Can I just say, I'm really not a fan of cats. But she is so so so, pretty and cute. Keep it up! You did an absolutely amazing job
I have a rescue cat. She wasn't in poor shape when I got her aside from a bad case of worms, but had spent almost 2 of her first 7 months in a cage at Petsmart.

After almost 5 years with her, I truly do believe rescue animals know they've been rescued; and show special favor towards the rescuer(s). Maybe not initially, but in time. 

It's intangible, and maybe I'm just crazy; but I can see that in her eyes, she's saying "thank you, sincerely".

Good on you. I'd upvote twice if I could.
Missed the first thread completely, missed this one too until i checked top of the month. I'm indifferent to a lot of things but this put a happy tear in my eye, thank you for being kind.
you vs who she tells you not to worry about
This is the good stuff
damn she got silky
From smol beastie to majestic beastie!
Left: Me inside

Right: How I present myself
She is beautiful.
Looking at stuff like this makes me so happy. Like there’s still some hope left in humanity.
Oh wow!! What an amazing job you did! She is such a beautiful kitty! Thank you so much for caring for her!
She's as beautiful as your heart was for saving her.
She looks so amazing. Congrats!!!
She's so beautiful! You've done good!
she is beautiful - gorgeous fur

good people
That is an absolutely stunning cat. Thank you for saving her!
The first one is heartbreaking but you guys did so much for the better. I’m sure Kyra is very grateful you guys care for her. She is so beautiful.
Rescue glow ups are the best. ❤️
You're a good person.
Wow gorgeous cat. That transition is amazing.
What a beautiful animal I love all animals and my weakness is animals and this warms my heart to see that cat have a home where it is loved and cared for😁
She is gorgeous. Good job human!
This are the results of a caring family!!! Thank you OP!
You're an awesome person. Your cat is pretty cool too!
Such a beautiful girl. Great work in supporting her recovery.
Awww she’s so cute
WOW - that is a cat worthy of a meme
She is beautiful.
She definitely found her human!
:)
Sweet girl!!!
Not a cat fan.  But thanks for taking care of that one. Have an upvote.
While attempting to upvote this I accidentally downvoted it, I of course rectified this immediately but I'm still horrified and ashamed. I'm sorry Kyra, I'll never forgive myself for that 5 seconds of downvote.
Just curious...do you pronounce  it keera or ky-ra?
i would die for her ok
She folds her tiny little arms. I know they are front legs.  (But I usually call them arms.)
Thank you for helping her!! People like you is what makes me happy.
Oh wow, what a lucky cat to have such a great family!  She looks lovely and healthy and pristine, such a beautiful girl!
She looks fantastic 😀
A perfect sugar loaf
Her legs stayed very polite!
Everyone Liked that
How incredible, love this! More people need to adopt, not shop.
May God places you in the highest place in Heaven.
you should’ve been times person of the year
People like you restore my faith in humanity, thank you for rescuing such a sweetheart! I’m happy she has such a loving and kind owner!
oh goodness, from tiny but sick smol curled feetsies to healthy, happy, sweet r/curledfeetsies! Tell Kyra Reddit loves her!

&#x200B;

Oh and thank you so much for rescuing her!! You saved this little soul, without you and the people who helped you and her she would have been lost out there!
Small kitty, little ball of furr, purr, purr, purr...
She looks so soft it doesn't even look like fur. Just a soft comfy bunch of floof.
That's a nice looking cat.
A happy and a long life to her with all the love. ❤️❤️🙏🙏
Poor Baby. We found our kitten 5 weeks old ,scraped ,scared and starving she’s doing good!
On the fife of the road.
Omg. ❤️🥰 I love seeing this!!!!
The fact that she is in the exact same position, but looks 110% healthier and happier, is awesome!
Thats fantastic!!!
as someone also named kyra, i’ve got to say i already think she’s great just because of her name. but she’s a beautiful cat, and i’m happy she’s doing much better now :) (also, do you say it kear-uh or kye-ruh?)
She's a big catto now, not a smol catto
Damn onions. Happy new year.

Many of you have messaged me and I'll get to responding to those and comments after a while because I have to work lol but wow! Just wow, thank you all for the awards!
omg was she mistreated by an owner or just abandoned by her mother? she looked horrible... anyway, you seem to have taken great care with her!
You did a good job!
Awesome job OP. She's a beautiful kitty!
Beautiful lady 🥰❤️
You are a good person and Kyra is a great catte.
I noticed a trend and so I searched for the phrase "Hey everyone" in this subreddit. The massive results were pretty funny, and made me wonder if that's like the secret handshake greeting for /r/aww.
Wish I had a glow up like that 😍
This made me want to cry, you're a wonderful person OP ♥️
She is absolutely stunning
So cute! We’ve rescued 8 kitties total. We lost one to FIP, but we’re so glad we had him in our lives the few short months we had him. He was the best little cat. So glad to see your kitten is doing well!
Still tuckin' those paws.  Thanks for saving her.
You are a good person for rescuing :)
Kyra you are splendiferous!!!
Just gonna leave this here:

Your cat looks very polite
kitty is less smol, more clean, and still wants to know what you have to say for yourself. ❤️❤️❤️
Awww... my rescue looks a little like her, mine has red spots added to the grey. It amazes me how she keeps her white fur so white!
Look at this lovely little lady, you've clearly done a wonderful job caring for her, OP! Cheers to many more years of mutual love and affection.
Just look what love can do!!
She went from ‘grumpily opinionated’ to ‘a wise advisor with comments and also hair’

I love how her feets are tucked in!!
She's an angel!
You can tell she's been well loved!
What a beauty!

She's beautiful!! My dog's name is Kira!

Still loafing
She is BEAUTIFUL, and her curly kitten paws are so precious.
What a sweetheart, thank you for taking such good care of this baby girl!

She's looking great!
She cleans up nicely.
Aw :)  Good job!
Beauty!!!!
Awww poor baby , she's so lucky to of found you
Gainz
What a nice young lady she's become
Ah yes, the loaf has fully risen
Every time I see something so friggin adorable, a voice in my head goes "EEeeeeeeee".

There was no one home today, so I took the liberty to scream it out loud. Very satisfying way to let the cute out.
Oh pretty kitty!!
She grew up in the position
That glow up came through something fierce!
Omg her little paws in the first picture is literally making me choke up. You’re good people! She’s obviously so loved!
Someone please make one of those memes that are like "what are the rules on pets here" "we dont allow pets" *sends image of pet* "okay we can make an exception because he/she looks very polite"
She’s so pretty. Good for you.
Beautiful I love cats

You have done a beautiful thing. What an adorable and gorgeous cat you have raised. Thank you for sharing.

I just realized sorting by "all" was a thing. "how stupid," I thought, "this is going to show me so much irrelevant bs." Boy was I wrong. This is the first post I saw and my first from r/aww.
Best comeback story of 2019
The first photo belongs in r/IllegallySmolCats . Such a beautiful cat though!
Blessed Kyra, blessed IFadingLightI, Kyra is such a pretty princess now.

This is the one to show the doubters the difference love and care can make. Well done. I can see that your efforts will pay dividends in purrs and affection.
glow up of the decade
That’s incredible well done, I love her little defiant cross legs
Went from scraggamuffin to distinguished member of feline society. Well done, Kyra.
 I feel like this is me but instead of cat it’s my mental state and in reverse 🤷🏼‍♂️
What a lovely lady, definitely a rags to riches tale.  You should be proud of yourselves.
Success!

She is glorious!
Thank you for your kindness towards this kitty 🐱 💕🕊
She looks incredibly similar to my cat
I wanna pet her so bad. What a sweet kitty
Looks almost like my cat!
Aww sweet little baby to a beautiful little lady.
Hi, sweet Kiki ❤️
I'm so glad for you two but also very sad to think that she would have been euthanized if you had not had saved her. It feels like for every 1 kitty we save, countless more are doomed just for being born.
Aw! She's beautiful! <3
She purty
Just by this I can tell that you are an amazing person! Such an amazing transition! Beautiful fur coat, shiny eyes, and all in all healthy + Happy looking cat. I wish there were more people like you guys.

Ah jeez this is going to make me tear up.
She looks very healthy.  You did good.
She looks so much like my cat in both of those pictures! I bottle raised her after finding her in poor condition at two weeks
https://youtu.be/06HHKmqeHgU?t=1m31s
I would let Kyra dictate my next victims.
I like how she sits with her legs and paws like that, cute. I like the little personality each pet and animals have.
Looking good! She's lucky to have you
she looks georgous!
This is what I needed to see today.
What a cutie 🥰
That fur looks so soft!
Sweet kitty
so happy she has a shepard caretaker...oh and you gus too. of course.

Gorgeous kitty
kyra went from a junkie to a movie star
LOOK AT HURR!!!

(I love how her paws are tucked in, hiding them lil pink beans! So dainty!)
"Well with me and kitties is like that book Catcher in the Rye, did you ever read that one? I'm kind of like the guy who looks after the kitties in the park, because otherwise there would be no one to take care of them. Like this one right here. I picked her up under a storm, with spray painted all over her body. But I fixed her up and look at her! That's one nice fucking kitties right there! "
Oh fuck! Wow. U deserve an award for this but I am broke
Good work
Yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy!!!  
Happy six monthiversary!
awwww so cute!
The glow in her eyes is amazing.  Thank you for taking her into your family.
Shes beautiful!
That's so awesome to see :) she is so cuteee
Hi Kyra! Such a a pretty girl!
She's so pretty!
wow that white fur is so cute oml
She just vibin' tbh.
Couldn't help but notice how she feels inclined to fold one paw in front of the other, now. She is doing amazing. Bless her little paws. 😘😘
Awwwwweeee! She still sits in the same pose. What a cutie!!
I love how healthy and strong she is now!!! Fantastic. I'm so glad you found each other💗🙏💗.
Gee... very good looking cat, you say it’s unlike any cat you’ve ever met..can you elaborate?
Wow she improved alot
She looks so beautiful and relaxed! What a wonderfully happy ending for both of you.
What an angel
What a transformation! She’s beautiful, from the start and now. Great job! *thumbs up* :)
Man that’s so wholesome
You have a good soul ,the cat in good hands
Looks great!
She is definitely gorgeous!
Lovely!
What a beautiful girl ❤️ bless you for nurturing her back to health
Wow she is too cute, I want to put her in my arms 😊😊
Meeee wow!
Two years ago I found an injured kitten on the side of the highway and took her home so I could bring her to the animal shelter.  I knew I couldn’t keep her because I had dogs etc.  Somehow she not only stuck around but is now the ‘head animal’ and scourge of the household.  Our massive, scarred, rescue pit bull is scared of nothing in the world other than when kitty pounces on her from the darkness..
Hello kyra
Looks like kitty just woke up hungover in its own mess after not showering for a week and not knowing what day it is vs after taking a shower and a comb.
Wow! Such a beautiful comparison. Congratulations on your thriving kitty!
I work with someone named Kyra.  Cats a pretty solid likeness to her.
Damn. I don’t even like cats. But I like that one!
Wow! She looks so healthy and happy now! Great job you!
Look at her little paws 🥺 you’ve done a wonderful job
Can I ask, were there any difficulties raising a kitten from a state of neglect? Like, did you have to go out of your way at any point due to injuries she'd suffered previously? Or was the healing process pretty smooth once you'd provided a loving environment?
What a total rags to riches fairy tale with an adorable princess!!!
be careful who you call ugly in middle school

Lovely lass!
Well isn't she just the sassy little lady! AMAZING progress! She doesn't remember that scraggly kitten she once was anymore. She's now owning her home!  Awesome job! (BUt you are her slave now so she's where she was supposed to be so I can't thank you for that or say good job. You are now her master... so she can rule you like the slave you are because she is the queen!) TOO CUTE
That’s a pretty kitty
Oh I love her.
F\*\*\* yeah!

edit...is that the super soft rabbit like hair that sticks to your face?
omg she's gorgeous!
Take your upvote, as only the heartless can just scroll past without doing so as well.
She definitely has found her forever home.
It looks like the browns in Kyra’s fur match your pups fur, judging by your early pics when she was itty bitty.  Wondering if this is still the case? They are both so adorable. Thank you for rescuing them both!! ❤️ You’re wonderful!!
Very beautiful kitty, deserves all the love in the world.
She looks exactly like my cat logo
So beautiful
Wow! Shes so beautiful!! And her fur!! It looks so soft and I really want to figure out a way to reach through the phone and pet her
Thank you for showing so much love! She looks super happy and healthy, well done OP!
 Oh wow!!!!  You raise it well！！！
She’s beautiful. TLC goes a long way
There is a special place in heaven for people like you.  Gid bless you a thousand times over.  Amen.
I love seeing this.  Awesome work!
Beauty!
She still fold her paws the same way. Too cute.
I wish many more animals could share this remarkable fait
Thank you for helping this kitten! The change in her appearance is crazy! I’m thankful that there are some people like you in the world!
Myra is super cute you did a great job
Oh what a beautiful baby!! Good job on fully baking that little loaf <3
Me on a Friday night vs me on a Monday morning

Cat.
shes such a cutie <3 beautiful white fur and pink nose/paws... just like my kitten
Ah my heart <3
Love it.
God, she is cuteeeeeeeeee
She looks like an Egyptian Goddess, damn
Thank you so much. I love you so much. Please never stop being as amazing as you are and give kitten mittens a scratch and boop for all of us in the thread. She deserves it.
I love this! I almost accidentally killed and then subsequently rescued my cat and have been indebted to her ever since. They really are worth all the hassle!
Ah my heart <3
Still tucking those paws in for additional classiness. I love it.
So so wholesome! Thanks for sharing this gorgeous transformation of love!
Beautiful!! I can see her personality through the pic.
She was not having you.  Now she’s having you.
She is a pretty cat!
That's a good job on fixing up that cat now I want a cat
FUCK YES! Excuse my language; love me some feel goods.
She's beautiful!!!
You are being such a good human, keep it up!
Oh my heart she still sits the same :,)
That’s a top notch kitty. Thanks for your kindness.
She is beautiful. Love works wonders.
I love you
aaa her widdle paws are folded

so polite 🥺
Awwwwww what a cute baby girl ^^
What a photogenic wee kittypuss
omg!!! i love her! awe the baby!
Holy blap that is the sweetest cat
Sweet baby
Even the tucked hands in the beforenis cute
Lovely! 😻😻😻
Beautiful!
Adorable! Got any in-between crusty scrawny and almost full-grown pics? Would love to see her as a chonky baby.
It's the same cat. I can't reveal how I know this because it's a trade secret, but it is the same cat.
What a babe!!! 😍
Omg I remember when you posted her!! She reminds me of my Tiny Baby when she had conjunctivitis as a baby. She almost didn't make it but now she's going on strong for 9 years. They're the same exact kind of cat too which is funny. I'm so happy Kyra is happy and healthy.
Aaaawwwww such a beautiful looking cat😊😊😊
Her fluff, I respect it
Oh my, she's charming as heck!
Sickly kitten to heathy cat.
Her form has reply improved with that leg cross. She’s really owning it now. 👏🏼👏🏼
That poor little waif in the first image -- you've taken such great care of her and she's absolutely blossomed!
She looks like she has the sweetest personality. Not your typical sassy kitty cat.
How old is she? My kitten is 5 months old and still had chronic eye boogies. I flush his eyes with saline solution and use a vet prescription occasionally. 

Your kitty had bad runny eyes and now seems to have none so I would gladly take any advice you have!
I'm not a huge cat fan, but that right there is a gorgeous cat.
She is so beautiful
Your cat is very impressive you must be proud.
The feetsies though...Bless you, you fucking awesome humans.
That’s love!
Nice job!
 You did a fabulous job! She is glorious. You must be very proud of her...and you should be. A very happy ending, for the end of the year.
So nice and sweet
my fave part of this is how content and peaceful she looks even in the first pic when shes still a bit battered and bruised. :') Its clear you all showered her in love as soon as you got her and improved her life tremendously!! <3
Now this, this is a glow-up
My dad got my cat outside of a Lowe’s one day without telling anyone because it was abandoned by the mother and it was the runt. She looks strikingly similar to this cat.
Glow up!!!
This is amazing, you should be proud! That's a beautiful cat who's clearly gotten a lot of love. Thank you for choosing to rescue a kitty and give her a chance at a better life.
Omg my kitty had a similar transformation. So glad she found an great parent.
Now Kyra has grown into a lovely and cute cat!
What a perfect angel baby of a cat. Good for you.
Thank you for making my day
Thank you ♡
Yes!
Gorgeous cat!
Great Job! She looks so beautiful! 👍
I have been moved to tears.
That’s one fuckin nice kitty!

Good loaf.
She is a beautiful cat!
I wonder if animals, but especially cats, are aware of how much their human helped them and if they are actually grateful for that. 

Great job!
Looks like CatPat
So cute!!
Vv
Oh my! That's how much love can do to a cat (or anyone!)
what a metamorphosis.
You are God's in the flesh!! You can see the love you have poured into this beautiful little creature reflecting in her innocent gaze. Wonderful!!
Blessed your beautiful Heart
Warms the soul!
She is beautiful - love the paws tucked in.  We have a rescued dog called Kyra - we took her Mum in 5 years ago when she was pregnant and ill - Kyra was the only pup of 4 that survived.  We also have 4 other rescue dogs and 3 cats that have adopted us!!
So sweet she looks amazen "God" bless her. She is a hero to save this baby.
I just want to say thank you.
