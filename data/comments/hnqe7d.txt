It might, but its disdain for the world at large is just overwhelming.
Pretty sure the people who make cat toys have never played with cats
I love how the cat is so lazy it just sits there and takes it. He knows it's going to keep hitting him but he knows this is his life now.
I mean... he's not leaving. So. Good job?
The cats me and the toy is 2020
This is a test for the rest of this year.

Is that cat wearing a necklace or just a collar with little balls on?

Human: I got you this cool new toy see it goes around and around and it lights up it has pretty colors and there's a feather thing you can pounce on and it's plastic and I think it's the coolest thing ever ever ever don't you LOVE IT??!!

Cat:  FML.
Can I return the cat?
Why I dont buy motorized cat toys. My cat shows zero interest in 90% of the toys I get her. It's not worth the money to take that chance.
Isn't that laser pointer dangerous for the cat's eyes? I mean, playing with it as a human you're never going to point it directly into the cat's eye, but that thing is just swinging around right at kitty eye level...
Beautiful cat ‚ù§Ô∏è
üòÇüòÇüòÇ this is excellent.
More offended than anything. 

"How could you dare think I would wish a pink feather and not PURPLE, mother."
Take this away - where is my box?
r/shittyrobots
Had cats since 60s. They have never had an interest in anything than hooman fun. Toys don't emit scents that are one of the key trust and ownership systems employed by nature.
Maine Coon?  They dont give a single fleeting fuck.
This is the most cat thing I have ever seen
Where‚Äôs the box?
Thanks for the gift! I..... love it.
Wow, that toy must be really exciting. I can feel the enthusiasm through the screen.
Cats are like a box of chocolates, ya never know which one you're gonna get
Yay:)
The look on his face says it all.

Fuck you Karen.
This is my kind of cat.
Watch out for those. I had one of those feather things (on a stick, but same deal) and my cat ate it and needed surgery to remove the feathers.
the fly I can‚Äôt catch so I gave up
Super chill cat
Put that thing on a rumba and then its game on
"Brave feline rebel gets mercilessly beaten by robot overlords"
I like how it getting smacked in the face is a minor inconvenience at best
 [u/VredditShare](https://www.reddit.com/u/VredditShare/)
Sits alongside of it and just gets smacked in the face and butt.

I guess it takes too much energy to find someplace else to sit? ;)
I have that same toy and my cats level of excitement is slightly less than this kitty haha.  I don‚Äôt even bother charging it anymore. Think I am going to give it to the local shelter. Maybe the kittens will like it more.
This is 2020 in a nutshell
*bonk*
Honestly, would it just be cheaper and faster to buy an empty box to take home? Because that always seems like the final conclusion.

Looks like a mini lion
Was this toy made by [herb welch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4jVLHrAXVo)?
This kitty could be my cats‚Äô sibling
Nah, I think he‚Äôs just too lazy to move.
"why are we still here, just to suffer?"
What a cat !
Well, he‚Äôs kinda getting pat on the head

What are the little borbles around his neck? Is he wearing a collar? i just cant figure what that is lol
Visual representation of 2020
spend $40 on a toy, and it still prefers saran wrap dug out of the trash or a shoestring
My cat does this too, just sits there and gets smacked. We say it's just because he is into bdsm
Kitty:  *please don't*
LOL!!! Could care less.
Exactly like my cats
Me as a cat.
Endurance is a kind of game
She is offended. So am I. :-)
Cat is not working
Life in 2020
Looks thrilled Lol
‚ÄúWhat happened to the expensive box?‚Äù
The first hit "oh no I have made a mistake wait cats don't make mistakes I will not move the toy will not win this!"
Why do they do that? Someone made that toy knowing cats like it but some cats don't care one bit about it.
I was laughing so hard, thinking, "how is that cat not phased," when he seems to glare directly at the camera at 0.16. Dying!
How much did you waste on that? üòÇ
This reminds me of the dad on gremlins and all the inventions he made that never quite qorked
This is obviously for our entertainment, not the cat's.
B O N K
Expensive cat rods, fake mice, beautiful toys: cat ignores/hates it

String on the floor, empty paper bag, bugs that got in the house by mistake, the staircase banister: cat loves it
That's next level laziness. Something keeps pissing you off but you *can't be bothered* to move. 

I aspire to this level ability to not give a fuck.
My wife when I try to interest her in VR
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the same as when you do it... hmph.‚Äù
This is exactly how my chonker would react. I bought her the best laser  pointers that I could and she just sits there and maybe bats at one of the images halfheartedly.
Can I get the name of this toy
!remindme 2h
An old shoelace is more exciting for a cat
Five more minutes of this and I'm gonna get mad.
It is my goal in life to be this unbothered...
My big dumb cat that I lost nearly a year ago had this weird thing where if you picked up his tail and dropped it, it would hit him in the face.  You could pick it up sideways towards his butt, and as soon as you let it go, it would land right on his face.  Didn't bother him one bit.
who knows why he likes that...
Wand And Laser! Very nice, my cats will love it
It‚Äôs amazing what cats will tolerate in the name of laziness.
Is that cat wearing a clown collar? It's adorable
I gotta be honest. What this reminds me of is my best friends bad ass son.  He jabs so hard at her and this is what she does.  When he does it to me, I tell him, I don‚Äôt like that, so you need to stop..   I still love you, but I dont like that. He stops.  But why does she allow him to do that.  She devotes every moment to him,  so it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs neglected.
He is not going to move for anything!  That cracks me up
Looks/acts like a Maine coon mix - takes 30min to get mine interested in playing
"Your toy is just a construct."
This made me laugh so hard. I love this.
I've bought stuff like this for my cats, and they were just scared of it.
The definition of "I'm not the least bit interested in this thing", haha!!
The reaction, or lack thereof, is exactly why I love cats.
Reminds me of [another inventor](https://youtu.be/SFdAOyI2YSw) who had a non-great run in with a cute but potentially dangerous creature.
u/vreddit_bot
He just needs to get warmed up first.
makes my day
Love how he keeps getting hit in the face and he just takes it so calmly
Kitty gives no fucks
How much did that thing cost
My GF and I bought this for our 4 cats and they love it so much!! They sit there and do the same thing until they get a spurt of energy to chase the light/feather! 

Took them about two weeks max until they ripped off that feather and chewed it up so make sure to grab an extra or two!
This is me and the toy is 2020
"Thank you sir, may I have another?"

Outsmart, outwill, OUTLAST!
I swear all pets are like this, I bought a couple balls to my puppies and they still prefer to run away with my damn socks. It's the beautiful struggle
This is a CATastrophe...
Invention doesn't cut it. Who did the performance testing with life cats?
So cute\~
I am a firm believer that the best cat toy are those plastic rings you have to peel off from milk jugs.
Good god this cat looks Exactly like my cat.
It‚Äôs so fluffy
This is my cat. She demands attention and then is immediately bored or disinterested.

I don't know what to do at this point. Balls, noisy balls, balls on tracks, string, bits of wire, ribbon wand things, zip ties, paper bags, laser pointers, wiggling various things or my fingers at the edge of something, using a stick to make a chaseable thing under a towel or blanket... None of it is good enough anymore.

It's incredibly frustrating, and it makes me feel bad because I don't know what to do for her anymore. She used to play with anything. She plays with nothing now. She's about eight, mind you. The only thing she does do anymore is wait at the end of her little tunnel to run through it when I come by. But using the toys at the end of that doesn't work anymore either.

Feels like my only option at this point is to get her a cat. Then she can chase him around all she wants. If I weren't in a tiny apartment I probably would've done it already. Barring that, is there something I may have missed?
In my head I hear a robotic voice everytime " PLAY WITH ME. PLAY WITH ME FELINE FRIEND."
Cats are so smart or something
The Lord (or Lady) of the manor is unimpressed with this gift, peasant.
To funny
This feels like a toy made a few years too early...
If someone knows a good cat toy please let me know, I'm worried about my girl's weight/activity level but I think it would be irresponsible to get her a companion cat because I can barely handle taking care of the two of us right now :/
*"I do not love it. I am low-key irritated, quickly moving into high-key. Payback is a bitch. I'll wait until they're asleep and scratch them, then run away..."*
My cat always broke toys like this.
Fuck them! **THWACK!** I am a pedigreed **THWACK!** cat descended from a **THWACK!** long line of champions, and I will **THWACK!** NEVER demean myself by chasing a fe**THWACK!**ather on a stick. Not even the laser pointer **THWACK!** can **THWACK!** tempt me to **THWACK!** WILL YOU PLEASE TURN THIS FUCKING THING OFF?! **THWACK!**
Kitty:  
"Behold the field in which I grow my fucks  
Lay thine eyes upon it and thou shalt see that it is barren"
THIS is why you gotta love cats!
Some cats are smarter than others.
I feel bad for the toy
This is what 2020 feels like
He'll get used to it...
My cat would be all over that laser like stink on shit
He is the Ron Swanson of cats. Lol

This kitty is annoyed of this new toy.

Show us the box
That cat is 100% chill.

Take notes: When life throws lasers and metal sticks wielding feathers at you, follow this cat's example.
I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs the toy or the cat that is the complete failure here
If I ever get a cat, I want this one!
He just wants to feel something...
This is life and me.
Now video of the car going nuts for the box plz.
There's nothing that could be more cat in that video lol
This is perfect.
That is one lazy cat
That cat is me dealing with problems in my life.
Does anyone by chance know what the toy is? Out of our three cats, one is the rarity who actually loves interactive cat toys, and I'd like to get one for him. 

Gorgeous house-lion in the video!
It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Sibling 9000‚Äù
Money well spent
omg this just made my night
This cat is an accurate representation of my current out view on life
This is more r/funny than r/aww. I couldn‚Äôt stop watching and giggling.
What kind of cat is this?
The autoboop 3000
When no one is playing online and all you have are ai bots to play with
Note to self: don't waste my money on one of these things on Amazon.
The more expensive the toy, the more my cat will hate it.
My would love that were did you get that
And right when you go to bed kitty will be bored and meowing in your face because cats are assholes that do not want us to sleep.
Living the efficient life.
As a single parent, I relate to this to my core.
Cat has welcomed its new little member of the fam by not caring about li‚Äôl‚Äôs flagrant rule breaking
That cat is channeling his inner Ron Swanson.
Purrfect for masokitts.
Why is this so funny
Hopefully you got some warranty on the cat, because I think your cat is broken.
Me with the entire internet but I‚Äôm still bored.
In my experience cats only want to play with things that you are involved in (pulling a string etc) or forbidden things. Anything else is uninteresting
That is so cat.
A whole mood.
Just like kids by them toys they get bored. Give them pots and wooden spoon and will play forever!!! Lol
What is this cat race?
Cats can be so freaking chill I swear I love it
LOL

Haha so cute
Thanks for the laugh!!
‚ÄúSmack‚Äù
I am Jacks total lack of enthusiasm
I adopted my first cat last year, and I‚Äôve bought him hundreds of dollars in different toys. He doesn‚Äôt acknowledge them. He doesn‚Äôt even like boxes. The only thing he enjoys is batting porcelain figures off my shelves onto the wood floor. He‚Äôs a bastard cat, and I love him.
That is an awesome toy tho
Your cat has discovered it's new kink
*smack*
I'm too old for this shit.
My cat would do the same thing lol. Cat toys are a waste of money for me, all I need is an empty box
Hilarious! Poor guy
This is what 2020 has been like so far.
This is the second post I've seen with a toy like this and a cat allowing itself to be hit with it. Do cats really just not like this toy or something?
Automated pet toys are always a bit weird to me, as part of the fun of having a pet is getting to play with them, why let a robot encroach on the fun?

Kitty seems so done with their new toy, I hope it wasn't too expensive.
It smacks yo kitty.
Lmao what the fuck is that thing loool
After a difficult morning at work, I really needed this laugh out loud in the empty lunch room. Thank you for posting!
Really sad today, this helps!!
I love its soft blinks
Kinda seems like it should go on r/shittyrobots
He or she is on a higher plane. I've been honored to own cats that were this way. Respect.
Please god just give me the patience of this kitty for the rest of my life.
When he has morning wood and you‚Äôre just not feelin‚Äô it
My cat is only caring, cuddly and craving attention  during the 2 hrs before I need to wake up...regardless of when that is...after that I'm not allowed near him if I want my legs intact and without scratches.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really bad eye twitch your cat has.... any ideas how she got it?‚Äù

Cat, for the love of all that's holy, please move! It hurt me more watching it get smacked constantly, than it probably bothered the cat.
If I ever get a cat 1000% getting a Maine Coon
Cute üòç
Cant this easily blind a cat if it just rolls on its back and looks into the laser over and over? I don't have a cat but I hear they do stupid shit for the fun of it.

TBH, I think it actually does.
I can relate to the cat, I too have given up on life.
Bonk!
Should‚Äôve just thrown a water bottle cap on the floor. Would‚Äôve gotten more play.
You should have gotten him a cardboard box. Preferably from Amazon. My cat loves those!

Doesn't even flinch. Just closes it's eyes. What a bum. Hahaha
Oh look, they turned 2020 into a cat toy
That toy looks so fucking annoying
Are you buying robots to play with your cats?
Cat ownership looks and sounds like... voluntary torture.

He‚Äôs like really my owners are so lazy üòÇ just saying
He's like "0 fuck is given"

This truly made me LOL!
Don‚Äôt lasers cause trauma to cats?
That‚Äôs funny, my cats rarely play with any toys I buy, but they do like feathers. Maybe he‚Äôs just tired.

BRING ME THE BOX... PEASANT
I have the same toy, my cat do the same thing, until I pickup said toy and manually move the laser pointer (defeating the entire purpose of said toy) and then he start playing with it like crazy, until I stop.
lol my cat plays with nothing but used straws

Have this. Cat broke it in day 2. Cats only need cardboard boxes and the $1.79 pack of springs. Don't waste money on anything else.
I bought 2 toys similar to this and my cat reacts the same. I'm fairly positive that cats know that its not their hooman playing with them, and its a machine instead.

Reminds me of Sideshow Bob.
Thank you to the OP and the cat. I haven't laughed a weird giggly laugh like the one I just did in quite a long while.
Poor cat
You like that pain dontcha kitten
Cats are assholes.  You'll spend a small fortune on them buying a new motorized cat toy, and they refuse to play with it.  Then they go dig a  milk jug lid out of the garbage and bat it around like its the best shit ever.
Ha-Ha!!!
My cats would do the same thing
I need one of these for my hyperactive kitten...
LMAO
Resist the urge comrade! Fight another day!
Cat: just sits there, getting hit by a piece of plastic over and over

Humans: he loves his new toy
If the cat hated it it wouldn't be sitting there
Really??? He looks bored
üòÇ They often prefer play with a piece of plastic then expansive toys. Lol
Those lasers will mess their eyes up just sayin
Anyone else want to get this thing just because you think having your cat sit in front of it like this would be hilarious and adorable?
Just move if it inconveniences you. This could be my cat. He is dumb as a rock but wont move if he sets on a place to sit.
... the box on the other hand!
Doesn‚Äôt seem like
Having that laser pointer just spinning around without any human involvement really puts me on edge. Seems so easy for a cat to lay down in the wrong spot and get the laser shining right into their eye.

‚ÄúYour training begins now‚Äù - Sensei Wu or something
We foster cats. We have one of these automated Laser robot thingys (It *used* to have the feather on the back but a Fat black and white foster called Figaro ate it, that‚Äôs another story). Gilligan a smart Ginger Tabby was as unimpressed as this kitty with our new toy. He didn‚Äôt sit in the feather-firing line, but he did sit with his back to it, and when we moved it, he moved so his back was still facing it...

Gilligan waited until 3.05am to press the large button on the top of the Laser robot thingy, turning it *on*. He then proceeded to hide, just out of reach, behind the TV. Watching the 4 foster kittens and the impending chaos...
Oh damn this is the goodest fur ball!
He seems to be very interested ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÖ

With my first cat (Persian) I would sometimes realize that I have been playing with the toy for a while and there's no interaction from his side...

It's very different with my second cat though (Bengal), she is crazy about everything that moves!
Way too much of bells & whistles on that toy! The poor kitty is overstrained! ;)
My dogs would have more fun with this than the cat
^(nah nah, i just want it to hit me.)
I mean tbh this just reminds me of myself in life.
For just $200 you could get your own gentle cat whacker!!
The robots are revolting!
What type of swatting toy is that? i dont know what it is, but the cat sure looks likes he enjoys it
Why not just play with the cat?
A toy? I thought it was a hitting stick üòÇ

When the world is telling you to move you plant yourself like a tree and say no, you move.
This is me when someone says look out
cool! a head bonker.
This video reminds me of my mom's old cat, Raul. He disdained her repeated attempts to spoil him. I remember one particular occasion when my mom showed Raul a new toy she bought for him. She played with the toy in a vain attempt to draw his interest. The condescending look on his face said, "hey lady, why don't you go play with your toy somewhere else."

Ever since this experience, I hate people named Raul.
This is next level unimpressed. Love it.
Yes

What is this thing? I too would like to buy this so it can just hit my cat in the face.

No offence but rhis cat is a moron...
Our cat is three and we got her at age one. She rarely ever wants to play. Bummer. I've tried buying all kinds of toys for her. Should have got a dog.
