"you coming?"
The water that my instincts have always told me about!

Hello water! **wafhhglaffllg**
To those of you worried about releasing a baby penguin into the wild alone:

" Release of a rehabilitated injured blue penguin adult (not a baby) back to where it originated from. The penguin had sustained a significant head wound from freeing itself from plastic netting. Pain relief, antibiotics, vitamins, rehydration, feeding and rest ensured a successful return to the wild.  


Did you know?  
Unlike the penguin species in Antarctica, blue penguins are largely solitary, and generally nest in small colonies or as individual pairs. "

&#x200B;

\- **Kaikoura Wildlife Rescue**
My brain knows that he needs to go be a penguin, but my heart says we should just keep him so we can cuddle up with him and watch netflix.
Penguins are the best bird
"I must go--the sea is calling me."
Made me happy and sad
You can tell when the instinct of the call of the wild kicks in.
*there's a line where the sky meets the sea and it calls me*
Oh my god he is the cutest sweetest little thing
[deleted]
“Should I stay or should I go?”
Me every Monday before I have to leave for work looking back at my doggo
[removed]
So damn cute!
"Where did you bring me?"  
"Whoa, Mom! Look at the waves! Let's check this out!"  
"...Mom? Why aren't you coming with me?"  
"Oh right, you get cold in the water. I forgot."  
"May I check out the waves? I may! WAVES REAL WAVES, HERE I COME!"  
"...Thank you for taking care of me, Mom. Bye bye for now!"

Oh great, I gave myself the feels again-
So long and thanks for all the fish
This is one of my favorite videos, and the first time I saw it I found myself like scared for him or something, imagining just going out into the ocean in those waves alone, but then it like dawned on me, _it's a fucken penquin, get a grip._
Destiny awaits!
[removed]
Reminds me of dropping off my son at daycare.
But as soon as water touches him, the animal instinct kicks in, and he knows he has to go. Farewell, sweet prince of the seas.
There is a reason she has sunglasses on even though it's overcast.  She's sobbing as anyone would be.
Brandy, youre a fine girl. What a good wife you would be, but my wife, my lover, my lady is the sea....
Aww....
Did I leave my headphones inside? Nope here they are in my pocket?
So small, so brave
I feel a bit sad seeing him go into the expanse of the ocean. So small in such a large space. Hope he’s ok
Im not crying, just sweating from my eyes
“Thanks for the fishies”
[deleted]
Sea! But land mom not coming? But sea! Land mom?
I would run after him and take him back
Thank you for this. I needed to see this today. The fires in Australia and the billions of animals who have lost their ives in them, really had me down.
Brave little guy, throwing itself into the waves…
I'm fucking bawling
I love how as soon as the water touches him instincts kick in and he goes
*"One last look at my friends"*
Breaks my heart in a way...
I wouldnt want to go in the Ocean either if i were that small. Too many danger things...
He's like. " Why aren't you coming with me?"
I always wonder if these animals come back to these spots like an hour later like " Alright Karen I'm ready to go hom....."
Here at last, on the shores of the sea - comes the end of our fellowship..
Not surprised he was unsure. That is a huge fucking stretch of water, and he's on his own.
The internet has jaded me, I half expected an eagle or an orca to suddenly appear out of nowhere and
This is so nice to see. Most of the time, videos of animals being rescued they just fucking book it fast as they can without looking back.
And then, after he finishes his swim, he comes back ashore to find his mother gone. Abandoned, he takes back to the sea in hopes of finding a new life.
*Should I stay, or should I go now?*
"Darling you've got to let me know,
Should I stay or should I go now." 🎶
Animals are sick, dude. They're so exposed, never in true comfort like us, just them against the wild world, surviving day by day.
"The sea.  It calls me into it's cold embrace."
lil penguein is go

no
Why am I crying in the club
Brave little guy, throwing itself into the waves…
*Oh, you've gotta let me knowwww*

*Should I stay or should I go?*
Kowalski! 
 
Sir! 

The sea! It beckons thee!
shouldnt it be released near a group? Can they live alone?
Penguin: "you coming?"
He's probably wondering where he is supposed to go
That would break my damn heart if I were her lol. I'd be at home probably bawling for a few nights hoping it was right to set him free and missing his little flippers 😔 so glad he made it! Exciting penguin times!
I just grew brovaries and got pregant.
"Oh my God, yes! Must go in water... wait but hooman..."  
\*sees incoming wave\*  
"later loser"
Why am I crying in the club right now
"Are you coming with me, Human?"
Kinda want to cry after watching😭
I would probably cry.
"but where are my friends ?"
Epic.
its so cuteee!!
The penguin is thinking: What?  You aren't going into the water?  Why did we even come to the beach?  Humans amirite?
If he goes there will be trouble, if he stays it will be double
But-but what if he comes back later after his swim looking for her.....
I just felt a "I don't wanna go Mr.stark" vibe
The moment ocean wave touches his feet, he realized that "this is my home"
Is he gonna be okay on his own?
Oh come on, don't look at me like that. :(  Just go, little guy. You're making this harder than it has to be.
OK, I'm ready for the Pixar film already.

I would also like a lunchbox with him on it.
As soon as the water hit his feets he knew where home was. See you on the other side dude.
No.. You're onions.
When u tryna be a penguin but I also kinda have grown attached to your human buddy
That's me everyday going to school
It’s enough to make a grown man cry
Breaks my heart in a way...
I need to know if he’s ok and if he found a family to love him.
Damn that seems like really big surf for such a little guy.  I hope he made it.
Good luck little buddy!
If you love something, set it free.
lil penguein is go

no
How will he fare, without his kind, all alone in the wide open sea?
Mah heart
My heart just melted.
Why am I crying in the club
I was concerned too, so did some digging. And by digging I mean a single google search with a reputable article. 

The penguin is as large as it’s species gets. It was rehabilitated by Kaikoura Wildlife Rescue after being found in a net with a head wound. It was released where it was found and watched for an hour post-release. 

Gives me a little more faith since it was a wildlife rescue operation.

Why is a ducking penguin making me tear up , duck!
 Shark- *Oooooo Food*
Awwww for fucks sake! So wholesome it’s tearing me up!
"And thanks for all the fish!"
I was waiting for an orca
It's probably thinking "You want me to leave home of warm blankets, catered smelt three times a day, and a safe pool with just other penguins to go into that whale and seal infested muck where I have to find my own food or die of starvation?"
But he’s all alone....
Sort of worries me that it had no family near it nor did it have any idea where it was going
*daddy shark intensifies*
I've been staring at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why...
"He's going to get eated by a shaaaark " -GIR
#Birds Aren’t Real
*gets eaten immediately
This penguin probably lasted 20 minutes max alone in that ocean. Nice job!
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
I feel terrible. I was touched. Then, I immediately imagined a shark or some predator gulping it down the second it got deep enough.
some say he's trying to get in the water to this day
Awww 😍 so cute 🥰🥰🥰
Hope they taught it to catch fish, otherwise.....
He takes 2 steps them turns round in a way that says 'Oh I thought you were coming too?'
I'll pretend i didn't watch this and imagine he lived out his life with his caretaker.
Aw, my heart. Little thing was like, “wait, you’re not coming? Okay... Wait are you sure? Well, okay then. Bye!”
One time we found a worm in our CSA veggie box. Kids took a liking to it, so we saved it in a jar and nurtured it. Fed it leaves of veggies, watched it grow, our 2yo named it Cinnamon, all the things a good pet parent would do. One day it rolled into a cocoon and from it emerged a fly. But it was still Cinnamon, and we loved him. So we decided to set him free, and he flew right into a spider web.... whoops. 

Sorry Cinnamon, but I guess that's the circle of life.
He got ate by a seal right after
Got me crying
"I'm a penguin not a fish, why are you releasing me into the ocean?"
OH NOOO COME BACK YOU'RE FLUFFY NOW!!!

i've become a 68 year old widowed woman so much so that this made me cry.
Where are the rest of the penguins at? Why release him solo, with no friends around? Or, are they just off camera or something?
His natural instincts to be free overcame his endearment to his human friend. That's sweet
Annnnnnnnnd dead
I genuinely hate that we have to release so many animals like this. I’m just playing devils advocate here.. but what if it loved being safe with humans and being loved?
Probably a shark ate him😥😥
Wonder how well - if at all - released animals survive :(
I would run after him and take him back
So long, and thanks for all the fish
Annnnd eaten by an orca
[removed]
That guy absolutely got eaten and soon as it made it to the deep. At least release it near other penguins
This reminds me of the scene in the fox and the hound where the widow releases Todd into the forest so he can be free but he is so confused and wants her to come too
I’m going to try my best to describe what I felt when when watching the clip. 

Initially it made me smile, watching the penguin waddle down the beach but when it first turned around it was like a small blow to my mid section from the inside. Then i felt sadness. Sadness for the little creature facing the entire ocean, alone. Maybe it just hit a little to close to home. Then he/she did a double take and it was another unexpected blow to the midsection. And i found myself catching my breath. 

Generally, we’re so sheltered as humans. Definitely riding the shoulders of giants.
That thing was almost definitely eaten while in shallow waters
Immediate gets eaten by a seal
Why wouldn't they release him to a colony of penguins, instead of on his own? He's too little to survive by himself! Are these people stupid?
better stay... pedguin are prey
Godspeed little dude!
Protect the oceans folks
Should he stay or should he go now
I didnt want to cry at work today
Never ever say animals don't capable such feelings because they're...
The feels are hitting
Feeding the fish?
Sucks about the pants
The power of metaphor is too strong.
The literal call of the sea.
Or looking around for predators. One of the two, I'm sure.
The ocean called him back
Wholesome
Adorable.
I love animals
I’m just glad this wasn’t one of those animal release videos where a hawk comes and swoops the critter up. 10/10 would watch again.
Wholesome.
Water hits his lil feetsies and hes like "aww hell yeah"
Freedom Over Bitches.

I'm with you, little guy.
I'd come back
Freedom still won!
Hart squeeze
Thank you for making me cry for past half an hour
Freedom is won
"Bye Buddy, hope you find your dad!"
🎶Should I stay or should I go? 🎶
ok breaking the feels... I hope he doesn't get eaten by an orca.
Onions
Aaand he gets eaten
Oh my goodness how precious
At least he knows where to go
Brandy, you're a fine girl,

What a good wife you would be...
Little one made the right choice!
I'm kind of sad that he's all alone tho :(
Y’all ever seen The Fox and the Hound?
If you watch the Irwins' show, most of the animals they release do this, too. Jane Goodall as well when she releases chimps after rehabilitation.
Looks like someone leaked the ending scene of a new Disney film.
Aww
The time has come...
Good luck little dude.
Hahha.... who the fuck cut the onions here??
CUTE
Cue "Should I stay or should I go" by The Clash.  


Also I teared up watching the video.
dang i can finally say ive seen this one a hundred times. thx for posting it again for our new reddit frens
Life comes fast kid
My heart!!!
Head injury? Hope he didn't have any brain damage from hypoxia or trauma. He looked so confused.
And then it felt that cold nostalgic water lightly brush it’s bootie and whisper “come home”
Omg those little feet and wings when he got excited. So cute
Well iight imma headout
🎵"See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me!" 🎵
By bitchhh
Boi got one touch of that water and said PEACE
wow
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
Awh this is cute
A man in South America rescued a penguin, rehabilitated it, then released it.

The penguin has come to visit him for the past five years.
I mean, she could have picked a less terrifying day to let the little bugger go out in the ocean on his own
So long, partner
Goodbye little fellow. Have a safe life out there.
He’s so little and that ocean is so vast...
u/vredditdownloader
Then he waddled away...

(waddle waddle)
See You Again
My heart :( ... So adorable
Watching a pod of over 100 blue penguins swim into the shore at nightfall was one of the coolest things and a highlight of my vacation to NZ two years ago. The place is truly magical.
The first real aw I've had there not just cuteness, but also emotion
I “rescued” a baby Crow once after it fell from its nest. After googling and learning I had not actually rescued him and had in fact perhaps created more problems for the little guy I promptly returned him to his tree. His parents were very happy to see him. I sometimes still wonder how little Russell is doing.
This is just a straight repost of a tweet, title included.
Pretty frickin' cute.
Torn between two worlds. 

Heartbreaking.
This is up there with the moment Ash let Butterfree go so it could make little caterpies with the female Butterfree. Just right in the feels
Pass the tissues...
Can he alive? Without any adult... It is dangerous and wild world, inside the sea...
I'M NOT CRYING, YOU'RE CRYING
Me going off to college
Real Home vs the new home where creatures give me food, medicine and keep me warm.  Tough choice.
Should I stay or should I go
Ahhh, duh seaa
Cue the Sara McLachlan music
Omg
" Go boy... go.... I don't love you anymore... forget about me.... go now...."
And then BOOM, seal.
Probably died in the same day, but if the helper is happy, I guess it was not worthless.
He acted like a child on the first day of school. Unsure of leaving their parent and caregiver, yet excited. Adorable post!
Wouldnt say its unsure its just looking back. Its a penguin not a human.. Talk about anthropomorphism jheeze
I love how he gets the first touch of a wave and never looks back...it's like he's finally home.
As soon as the water touched him he went, "MY PEOPLE NEED ME!"
His journey starts here
So inspirational, thank-you for sharing.
Once he touched the water he was like “no,no this is the right choice” and ran off!
Everyone I know goes away in the end
Fuck I love penguins
Repost
I'm not crying, YOU'RE crying
Hello World.
The call of the wild. Irresistible.
Should I stay or should I go nooooooooow...
First day of school be like...
And then there’s a shark

Reminds me of that video of a girl who released a tiny rabbit for a quick and easy dinner for a local eagle
This made me think about my dog. I had to put her down last November. I knew it was the right thing to do but still hard. This video is the perfect representation of that day, for me.
Once the wave hit his little feet...💕
I know this is what is best for it, but it still makes me so sad.
instincts vs lovin' its human momma

Reddit response for the slightest emotional tug.
“I’m not crying, you’re crying!” 
“I have no tears left!” 
Or some stupidity involving the cutting of onions. 

Are people exaggerating their emotions or am I a cold “b”?  Those kinds of comments make me irrationally annoyed, I’m aware.  They feel like 
r/thathappened.
Legends speak of a penguin that would rule the seas and conquer them all..... this is his origin story

Movie will be released by Disney this Fall 2020
Nature beats nuture
I was listening to Aphex Twin “#3” while watching this and it made me think that the penguin feels incredibly alone, about to embark on a journey into the cold wild and there’s no going back.
Once it hits the flips!
That is so fucking adorable
*Ja, Simran, ja... 
Jeele apni zindagi.*
"What are you doing?"

"Taking one last look sir, at my friend's"
Crying my eyes out god dammit
"Freedom... Food and cuddles... Freedom... Food and cuddles..."
"Get out of here! Can't you see I don't want you anymore?"

Then it just falls over and dies.
Reminds me of me, when I moved out of my parents house.
This really pulled my heart strings.
feelz
*hawk*
Put down the penguin and let’s get to Australia
r/MyPeopleNeedMe
Imagine that penguin just went for a swim and when it returned his family was gone.
Neat
Giving a waive goodbye to hit the waves
This is true Disney tearjerker material right here.
And I’m teary
Once the water touches his feet he's like "Yes, this feels so right!"
But then the water touches his legs and he knows that he belongs there
This is me when I have to choose between surfing or starting a life in Ohio. $2200 for a 1bd apt is fine, it's fine.
Once that water hit, that was it!
Doesn’t matter he’s probably already dead...
SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO?
Or is looking out for predators.
Pengling!
Go on, git! Pa said we can't keep ya no more!
Awww, sweet!
Awww that’s so nice
Who else loves penguins!?
Why wouldn't they release him closer to a colony though? He's going to have a hard time solo...
Well, that made me fucking cry.
Ugh this makes me miss my cats. They’re not dead or anything. They’re just at home and I’m at work. :(
I hope it survives
Y, I bgc
That woman needs to be free in the Arctic waters to be happy.
Is there any run cuter in the animal kingdom than this ?
Goddamnit I love him!
“Mom, are you sure? I’m scared”
“It’s a scary world out there.”
*water touches feet*
“Okay bye Mom!! I’m going to play now!!”
The moment he enters the water BOOM eaten by a seal
The way he looks back is a look of "Where the fuck am i and how do get back to my family? Where did these large things take me to? ok, they are all staring at me, lets get away from them."
She must have been very kind to him/her
Was expecting one of those videos where 10 seconds in a seal comes out of nowhere and eats the little guy.
Aren't they supposed to be with the flock/parents? Especially the young ones.
Nice
Penguins are so adorable!
"I want to get one last look... at my friends"
C3PO would have been proud.
Human, what are you doing? Where are you going? We gotta go! We’re missing the tide!
He's like dafuq am I supposed to do now?
That's beautiful!
Would that little guy last long without his other penguin buddies, all alone in the big ocean?
Nature taking course..
Should I stay or should I go noooooowwww
So happy and sad at the same time
This feels like a Disney movie
Should I stay or should I go?
"Am I free but you are so nice"
Baby peguins are adorable
I know you cant come, but thank you for all
I wonder if he/she bonded to the human by accident.
Reminds me of the story of an old man who took care of an injured penguin. Every year the penguin comes to visit him
Call of the Wild
“But animals don’t have feelings” 😂😂😂 but seriously tho, my heart 💕
This made me tear up.
“Are you not coming with? Jump in, the water is fine!”
Then it was eaten by a shark .
The struggle is real!!!!
Aww....hope he finds done friends.
Why am I crying
Go little dude! Look at him go!
So sweet
Gud 'guin. I'm doing this right amn't I?
Probably got swallowed during the next week.
Damn that lady skipped leg day
And 5 minutes after that video, he got slaughtered by a shark.
That was me when I was a baby when my mom and dad separated and he left with his stuff
So long, and thanks for all the fish!
Oh cool, we’re at the beach!  

Water looks nice, think imma go swimmin.... 

Aight, here we go!

Wait, you guys come swim with? Aw cmon! Water look nice!

Aight... well you guys stay here?  Hey, you guys stay here, right? You my ride home. 

You watch my stuff? Cool. BRB WEEEEE!
Aww! So adorable to watch the feeding of the killer whale just offshore!
Hmmm...the cold unrelenting ocean OR the cute chick in yoga pants???  Hmmm
Should I stay or should I go now?
Awww....Gulp.   🦈
Awww all alone out in the big ocean, very scary!

All the best little one!
what kind of penguin is this cute little dude? He looks like a Little blue penguin (Korora), but I'm not sure.
Cue Moana singing
There are ignorant humans who believe that animals are incapable of understanding, emotions such as love or gratitude, and interspecies communication. 

How egocentric. Humans are animals, and we are capable of these. Why should any of us assume we are the only animals possessed of these qualities?

This penguin displays a beautiful example of these virtues.
Oh god my heart can't take it! It's so nerve wrecking to see that little guy run towards the ocean. I hope he unites with more of his own kind.

"Aw man I don't know, should I stay? These waves do look pretty bonus. Ok, NO LOCALS, GET OUTTA HERE."
He thanked his human and said goodbye ❤️😢 So touching!
😭😭😭😭😭
It'll be dead in a week.
I’m not crying your crying
They might die out there. Or become bycatch by the fishing boats, that's disturbingly common
Should I stay or should I go?

I would never be able to work in wildlife rehabilitation because i would never have the strength to be able to release these beautiful creatures back into the wild.
Why is this so sad to me???
1 minute later a shark got its breakfast
Yes it is an adult
SOMEONE BETTER MAKE A SHORT FILM HOLY GUACAMOLE
Hold on!   .....penguins live in the ocean?....I'm so confused.
Be free little guy :)
If you tell me this was a goodbye I’m taking a mental health day from work
Hes like: you comin with me?
Wait will he drown? He's so small.
Someone add the Bruce Banner “lonely man” music plz
Oh why in the Clonazepam did I watch this video?!  

***tears***
Feels like an bittersweet ending to a movie.
My heart!! I can't! He's so little. And as soon as he touches the water he's like "oh yeah, of course!"
>There's a feeling I get when I look to the west, And my spirit is crying for leaving.
My heart is breaking! That sweet little penguin!
Why am I crying
Awww like thanks girl, i appreciate you but ok off to home i go.... i hope little thing is ok
Not gunna lie I’m crying man. I’d like to think that he looked back to say thank you for saving his life.
This reminds me of that penguin in Brazil who spends half the year hanging out with the guy who rescued him and the other half swimming around the world crushing penguin puss
good luck king
My heart.
And no one knows, how far it goes.
I never really think about penguins being ocean dwelling creatures. Do they just stay around the beach or?
Ohhh my heart
That peng needs a jetpack
So nice of her to feed the sharks
And thank you for making me cry
Who's cutting onions in here?
Take notes, Richard Parker
I love him
I’m not crying you’re crying 😢
It waddeled away.
Why not just keep him and feed him Costco salmon
Poor bird probably got ate by a shark, seal, whale, or any of its natural predators
i did this with a duckling I found with a damaged leg. when i released it back after it healed it swam to the nearest momma duck (not sure if it was the original mother but from same pond) which promptly attacked it and chased it away from her ducklings. when it swam out to meet the momma it was like this video, so sweet and made my eyes water and then bam it swims back and my eyes dried up real quick

I tried a different place that had a fenced in lake but the other inhabitants quickly chased it away also and i found it cowering trying to get out. Since it was used to being alone i guess it messed it up and it ran to go meet the swans/geese which didnt appreciate the little guy.

It ended up going to a farm to live the good life but it was not the ideal option. I learned my lesson and wont be taking in animals unless i intend to keep them and wont be expecting any release to the wild efforts to work.
Maybe it wasn’t looking back to ask itself whether to stay or go.

Perhaps it was looking back to ask the human if they’d stay or follow.
For some reason, this reminded me of the time Ash let his Butterfree go in Pokemon.
Too bad he didnt make it far...
Baby animals deserve all of the upvotes!
What an awesome little creature. 

I could see and feel the uncertainty in it's little body language. 😢❤️

If you think life is tough.. You likely have no fucking idea how tough it is for an awesome little creature like this. 

Kinda hard to comprehend. 

Probably got caught in some wire and died shortly after. 

Sadly we simply we don't deserve them.
The reason the penguin pauses is because he's timing his run into the water with the wave receding so he can get the furthest into the surf. He does look back while doing so though.
Should I stay or should I go starts playing...
Hoping for some free food, one last time.
I am CRYING.
See the light and the sky and the sea- it calls me!!!
He was like:

You not coming? :(

Alright bye bye ;)
Aw yeah. Once he got some of that briny on his drummies he was good to go!
"Hey, what's going on? Are you coming too? I'll go up a bit. Hey, aren't you coming? Aren't you coming to the sea too? ...

...I'll miss you."
*plot twist* it was calling its squad to come "get" her 😂😂😂
I’m not crying you’re-yeah, wait I’m crying
I love penguins.
Waddle on.
May nature go easy on you, at least for a bit, little penguine.
Why project human Sense to animals.
God speed little one
Again? Since I've been on reddit, I've seen this same penquin released 17 times.
The feeling I have is where sadness and happiness meet.
When he felt the water he got 100% sure.
Fuck the ocean if I was an ocean animal id stay as someone’s pet if I got lucky enough
"HES GOING TO BE EATEN BY A SHARK XD"

guess what show that quote came from
But where he gunna go though?
Wow. Bless his little soul!
That just made me cry.
Survival chances?
I always gotta laugh at how people try attach human experiences to animals.  He's doing that out of instinct because a penquin going into the water alone is often a dead penguin.
Should I stay or should I go? 🎵
That’s just adorable
mom?

Aren't you coming with me?
I'm crying at this the bird is friends with that person and he says are you coming you want me to go by myself alright
But his life, his love and his lady is the sea.

I actually felt a little swell of sad and heart-warm and other stuff...it must've been a bittersweet moment for the person who rehabbed him.
Brave penguin!
Makes me sad...
Can that thing survive while not in a group?

Isn't this a little like an alien nursing your broken leg and then dumping you just wherever (possibly in the middle of a forest or desert) like "what... you're a terrestrial animal, aren't you?"
Little Blue Fren!
Hey, I saw a :(

Here, have a :)
/u/vredditdownloader
Let me hug you!
“Aren’t you coming too?”
da penguin
He looks too young to be all by himself.
I would stay with the nice lady
:’( it’s just like us, our parents and us, and us as parents and our kids.
She put him in the Dead Sea. Oops!
Didn't read all the comments, but for of all the ones I did read : loving the wholesomeness of this thread
That's so bitter sweet... I hope he lived a full life.
My heart just melted
Asking somebody who knows about these things, which I don't. Is it safe to the penguin to be released alone like that? Shouldn't they drop him closer to a colony?
u/doodlelut
I think my eyes got some type of infection...
Penguin scans the area assessing for predators but on Reddit it's a schmaltzy story about true love.
Does anyone have the meme version of these?
Being a lifelong Floridian, almost 4 decades, I'd have the same reaction.
And then he drowns in the waves before he can get past the surf.  

Yeah, I know. I'm a sick person.
"Mom... mommy, where are you .... oh but the water... but everything I've ever known is back there... " What a sweet little thing <3
Aww
First day of kindergarten.  

Kiddo:  mom. I'm scared.

Mom: It's okay.  You'll make lots of new friends.  You're ready!
"my instincts tell me to go, but my heart tells me to stay"
Swim well little fella.

Killer whale off the coast "it's free real estate"
Aaand the Sea Lion got him. Fuck.
His little wave
u/schnoodledoodledo where are you?
You've got some work to do jow
The penguin- c’mon guys hurry!
Too short video!
He kinda looks like my last dinner.
So cute antic...
What if he just wanted to go for an hour long swim, only to come back and see his friend gone.
Awww
I definitely shed a tear over this.
So long and thanks for the fish!

That would've borke my heart, I would want to keep him
Releasing an alone animal to the sea looks a touching scene for a movie but in real-life, an average size sea creature may eat it in just an hour. It has no experience, survival skill and alone.
I hope he doesn’t get eaten by a seal or shark.
*'Up' piano theme intensefies*
No one knows how far I’ll go!
I need someone to edit in some hype music when it starts to run towards the water.
Hey! Seal food!
If you want me let me knooooow...Should I stay or should I go?🎶
That looked like a goodbye wave, there.
Lol he's saying, as he turns back, "you guys better be back when I come visit". It's so cute
The sea is calling little one.
Are you not coming?
\*cries violently\*
so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Cue "Far as I Go" from Moana. I'm not crying.....oh wait, yes I am.
/u/vredditshare
When he touched the water he knew what he had to do
Or: "Why aren't you coming with me mommy?"
Omfg... why did I have to see this? I cant handle the internet today...
"I'll never forget you, Sharon, but I'm married to the sea. Someday you'll love again."
"Bye bye, hoomom. Thanks for everything. Love you."
Once the water touched him, he knew.
Water! Water! I missed you so- HOLY SHIT THATS COLD AGH CRAP ITS IN MY MOUTH ITS SO SALTY *dry heaving*
I didn't feel like crying today but ok
Aww 😭
I love you..but...the sea is calling...I just go...wait...no I must go...byeeee:)
Ok im sorry but some one has to do this

Penguin: *swims out to sea* *grows into a.        strapping young penguin*

Years later

Penguin: *relaxing on ice*

He should have stayed but yes it was cute.
Seen a lot of these kind of memes but they are cute. Very breathtaking.
Made my face leak..
Fofo

Good god! I pray he wasn’t just sucked up by some shark! He’s so teensy and hardly able to walk much less swim?!
Smile and wave boys, smile and wave
So dam cute

I was waiting for a killer whale to snatch him up lol
Hope it finds some birdy friends soon
This is what I want to do in life, does anyone know how to make a career out of this?
I don't mean to be a party pooper, but this is a repost. I've seen this before here.
Me trying to remember where I parked.
Maybe it will return like Dindim!
Penguin: “you expect me to go where? Fuck this”
I'm sorry little one:(
“But I wipe my own ass! I wipe my own ass!”

“I KNOW!....😢”
I hope there was a flock around, it wasn't a good idea to send him off alone.
Onions. someone is cutting them. bastards.
Like a duck to water.
Fun fact: penguins are necrophiliacs
well i’m in tears
Baby penguin: should I stay or should I go
It was definitely eaten by a seal no longer than 3 minutes later
I love him!
"Hoboken??? Ooooooh I'm dyin' again!"

Too obscure?
...and I said what about Breakfast at Tiffany's?
I spent Few hours od waiting for some special rare pinquins livin on New Zealand. We were waiting for a group of fww. But just one small dude appeared. I have so funny picture of just one lonely point in far distance walking of the sea to hide after about 10 meters of quite fast penguin walk.

Orca fodder for sure...
MY HEART

FREEBIRD!
It had a blue pill / red pill moment
You gotta pull a Harry & The Hendersons: punch it in the face so it will leave.
u/hauptsachedabei
Probably saw a killer whale and was like should I be a prisoner or take my chances with the killer whale fuck it killer whales it is.
Maybe im a pessimist, but i see this and i think "that thing has no chance"...

Is he at least being released near other penguins? How are they just gonna dump a penguin on the shore and expect him to know the way
What are the odds a baby penguin survives being randomly dropped somewhere in the ocean without any experience hunting or any other penguins around?
He's going to die
Who's cutting those ficking unions
He was waving bye.
Out of curiosity, would they know where to go and if so, how?
"Aren't you coming?"
Awwwww i love penguins there so sweet
Should I stay or should I go? (Stranger Things)
..only to be eaten by god knows what
“Hooman, am I really supposed to go?”
