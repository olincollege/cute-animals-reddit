Lol that‚Äôs a nice kitty. One of ours ignores the hell out of you for a day for daring to leave her. Then all is usually forgiven. 
When I go away my indoor security camera catches my cat waiting for me to come home. Looking through the window and laying in front of the door. If it is more than a couple days his meows become pretty traumatizing. 
You have to cancel everything you have going on the rest of the evening. Don‚Äôt make that sweet kitty get up 
This may just be the sweetest thing I've ever seen on all of the internets.
It's nice to be kneaded.
I've been away from my cat for 6 months and by the time I get home it will have been 8. I cant wait to be reunited with her and see what she does. I'm worried she won't remember me.
Seems to me that you missed your kitty just as much.  
I once had a cat who was traumatized if I didn't walk through the door by 6:30. He would start pacing around 6:20. Pawing at the door at 6:25. Meowing  at 6:30. When I had to go away for work, he was inconsolable for the first night or two. Then he would seek out my husband until I came home. But he wouldn't greet me when I walked in. No, I had to be punished. I had to feel his wrath and despair before he would deign to let me pet him. 

He would wait until I sat on the sofa. He would jump up and sit next to me, waiting for me to make eye contact. As soon as I did, he made a big show of standing up, turning around and sitting back down, with his back to me. And then he'd start flicking me with his tail while occasionally giving me the side-eye over his shoulder.

I had to extol him loudly, telling him what a handsome and good boy he was and how much I missed him and how terrible I was for leaving him for three whole days and nights. When he was satisfied with my praise and groveling, he would turn around and snuggle up next to me, purring and kneading up a storm. All forgiven until the next time I went away.

Damn, I miss that little drama queen. 
Ohh!!!  The perfect homecoming‚Ä¶  üòª
....so  you wanna tell me where you went?

you know, two nights alone i spent....

i wondered if you thought of me,

n how it felt to you to be

without me there, right by your side,

you know, i think i might've cried . . . 

i thought - would you come home again ?

please don't leave me,

i *need* you, fren

This hits so many levels of adorableness: /r/CuddlyKitties, /r/CuddlePuddle, /r/KneadyCats, /r/MasterReturns
Roses are red

Violets are blue

This is cute

I'm allergic to cats
Proof of this makes me laugh at those articles by "cat experts" that state cats hate cuddling and holding.
/r/KneadyCats 
Meanwhile if any of us is gone for a while, when we get back our cat comes down hours after we walk in the house and is like "Oh. I thought you left."
I can almost hear the downright aggressive purring in this vid
You're both cute!
So presh!!! Glad you two have each other!!
You owe me a monitor. It has melted down!
This is the cutest thing I've seen all day
Cat:  "Never leave me again!"

Also cat:  "I knocked over the plant, spilled your glass of water, and peed on the carpet while you were gone.  Sorry, dude."
Omg look at those two little feet sticking up!
My cat does this whenever I leave for at least a few days. He'll ignore me for an hour or two as soon as I come back, and then once he's forgiven me for leaving, he'll snuggle up with me and won't leave my side.
the very first time we went away we had a neighbor come over every day to check litter box, food and water, and to play with our cat.  As soon as we opened the front door, our cat walked over, looked my husband in the eye and proceeded to urinate in his shoe.  No f's given.
"I was afraid you were dead, food machine."
I don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs happier and I love it. 
the pure bliss on each of your faces!
My cat is like this always.  I say he's my weighted anxiety blanket üíô
Show this to everyone who claims that cats are ‚Äúhorrible‚Äù and don‚Äôt care about their owners
Awwww ‚ù§Ô∏è I was away for a week once and my cats plonked themselves down on my lap as soon as I got back. Refused to move. They aren't really lap cats so I took that as them missing me. 
I can get a reaction close to this by simply turning down the thermostat. 
Aww so sweet, the love of a cat is very special!
I see your cat is as aloof and cold as mine is.
Show this vid every time some idiot says cats aren't affectionate. 
So sweet!
I want to cuddle with your cat. So cute
They are using behavior that they would use toward their mother‚Äîall the behavior they show toward us is derived in some way from the mother-kitten relationship. The kitten learns to raise its tail, rub on its mother, and knead and purr. Grooming is what mothers do back to kittens.

So they're using bits of behavior already in their repertoire to communicate with us. There aren't very many behaviors‚Äîmaybe half a dozen.
Aw
I didn‚Äôt know cats were on reddit and could type!
Someone is spoiled rotten....and rightfully so 
Your cat is pure <3
Message: "You do dat again Ima gonna tear yo ass up".
This pretty kitty looks exactly like my first baby. I got her as soon as I got my first apartment in college. She would be the little spoon and let me snuggle her, she would fetch, and she was so patient when 15 years later my daughter wanted to carry her around. This video brought tears to my eyes, I miss her so much. Get all the snuggles when you can. 
Business cat's human really missed him.
... and people think cats are aloof and don‚Äôt care about their humans ... ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
The little wiggly back feet are the cutest part!
I went out of town for 2 days on business. My husband was home. When I got home my husband said my kitty didn‚Äôt eat while I was gone and would not come inside, except to see if I were home. Once I got home my kit followed me everywhere and when I got in bed, he got beside, put his paw on my arm and went to sleep. The next week I had to go out of town again, and the same thing happened. A couple of weeks later I was asked to go again. I declined. I told them my cat would starve and would need to be put on an antidepressant. 
Okay, this is the cutest thing I've seen all day. But I have a question.

I think we have the same breed of cat, I found her off the streets a long time ago and have never been able to determine what breed she is, everyone says she's a maine coon but she's far too small. Do you know what breed your baby is?
That's one hell of a nice kitty right there
I can hear it purring from here
Oh my gosh you‚Äôre both adorable. 
That's it. This post was the final straw. I've decided to adopt a kitty. 
Surprised you haven't been judged by the pro declawers. I prefer to see my kitties all natural
So many biscuits. 
Awesome 
MY HEART IS MELTING LOOK AT THOSE LIL PAWS AAAAAAA
My cat does this same thing to me, i wonder what's it's significance. It's like she's trying to claw me but not really, idk. Any thoughts?
I love the fluffy jelly beans!!! 
Scary how much our cats look alike. My Eugene shows the subtlest amounts of affection. When I come home from work trips, it manifests in the form of a brief brush against my leg with heavy tail fluttering before he disappears again. It‚Äôs not much, but enough to warm my heart with happiness when I finally make it home...
Belly Squdgin'?  My boy loves that.

&#x200B;
I see lot of happiness there
I love it when cats massage things like this. Does anyone know why they do this?
Kit kat love!!
Don't ever leave again, I knead you.
Aww he loves his Dad for sure.
That is the happiest I‚Äôve ever seen a cat
Awwww I love that you‚Äôre so happy too!

Cat love is the best love!
Aww, Tobey Maguire has such a cute kitty!
So cute! 
I can feel the purrs
I want a cat to love me like that
Looks like you have luther vandross playing in the background...
My boyfriend and I went away for about four or five days. We had friends that our cat Izzy knew come and play with her and feed her. In fact, the last time we had gone on vacation she had stayed with these friends so she wouldn't be alone(now we had two cats, and they couldn't take them both) and when we picked her up she didn't want to leave her new buddies!   
It made me cry at how much she was fighting coming home that one time. With that she's been very angry with my suicide attempt that she was there for and my inability to play with her so much going through intensive therapy. But that night I woke up in the middle of the night with her laying next to me with her forearms wrapped around my forearm. 
Wish my cat would do anything close to this. She's 2 years old, had her since she was a kitten. On the ride home from the rescue area she bit a hole in the cardboard container while making demonic noises. First thing she did when we got her home was steal my wife's pickle off her dinner plate, but she has been an aloof bitch ever since. Only time she interacts with me is when she wants food in her bowl. She likes my wife though.
Oh, the SHEDDING!!
This is cute I wish my dog was like this
I think he KNEADS you! Hah, I'm such a card
Making biscuits is what my gf calls this. Both her cats do this on my fuzzy sweater
Haven't seen cats showing this much affection.It's cute
You were gone forever in cat time, they even counted
That face. He's totally in the zone. 
My life goal is to be loved on this much by a floof
Awwww.....
Oh this is very pure
Looks just like my kitty
What a cutie pie, that cat 
People say cats don't care. That's 100% false. Cats show every bit as much affection as a dog. I love cats. And I love how this guy is trying to make bread from a hoodie.
Aww, that kitty loves you :)
Looks like he really kneaded you!

I wanna hear purring DAMNIT!
And they say cats don't show love.
I wish my cat would do that to me. All she does is shit everywhere and act like a bitch, but I love her so much regardless!!
I started a new job and am traveling for weeks at a time. This time I'll be gone for a full month. I hope my kitty feels the same when I get back.
Dude! This is the cutest thing ever ! Thanks for sharing :)
That‚Äôs so cute
Awesome 
Omg!!!! So cute.  Cats are the best. <3


Aaawwwww the squeezeey paws! 
Yeah but what kind of conference does a cat need to go to?
She really kneads you. 
I need this in my life...
Dude looks like Tobey Maguire
A couple years ago, my best bud and his parents went on vacation for 2 weeks and asked me to watch their elderly cat, they had cameras installed (which I didn‚Äôt know before hand). I showed up twice a day to play with him and feed him. I guess they‚Äôve had bad experiences in the past with pet sitters. My buddies mom almost cried when thanking me for helping out. Fuck people who ignore animals 
When I go away, my cat pukes on my pillow..,
I think it‚Äôs safe to say he kneads you
Just came back from a work trip and my cats ran away from me when I walked in the door... I haz a sad. 
"I still could have killed you."
I wish my cat wasn‚Äôt an asshole. He only gives me lovies when he wants food. 
Is the cat sad about Stan Lee‚Äôs passing?
Post saved. This is beautiful. 
I'm not sure who's happier to see who. 
We dont deserve animals
Kitty: "Please don't ever leave again hooman." 
It's a kitty!   With her Daddy!
This was my cat today too!!!! I had been away for five days and she just couldn‚Äôt stop purring and kneeding me! What a precious little fluff you have üòç
Not to bring everyone down but....please make sure whoever you use as a pet sitter is doing their job..my daughter works at a vet office. A couple went out of town for a few days and left a friend to care for their diabetic cat. When they got home the friend informed them that she had not Givin the cat ANY of its shots for diabetes. They rushed him to the vet but sadly he was not able to recover. The person never told them while they were gone so they could have gotten someone else to do it or paid a vet or anything. That was a totally avoidable death. Play it safe.
How can a cat type on reddit?
I have lived with 7 cats since graduating high school. Each one reacted to my absence differently. One laid outside my bedroom door and cried every day for a year while I was at college. She wouldn‚Äôt leave my side when I came home. Another would pout while I was gone and be angry and ignore me when I first came home. Those were most notable.
I'm a dog person, but this made me say "awwwww" out loud. True love! ‚ù§
relationship goals.
So sweet. My cat gets super stressed when I'm gone for more than a day. The moment I sit down he is up in my face, meowing, head butting. I noticed this last time he had chunks of fur missing. I feel like he gets too stressed:(
Whenever I cuddle with my boyfriend after days of not seeing each other
And people say cats don't love their owners..

My cat isn't very touchy-feely, but she cuddles every once in a while and it's the most adorable thing
that cat kneads you.

&#x200B;
It's pizza time
Rubbing his belly? That's odd a cat let you do that.
She is squeezing you so hard to somehow compensate for the days you were gone.
Your kitty kneads you.
R.I.P his Clothes Everytime he comes back
This made my eyes itch
Everyone says cats don‚Äôt care , but really they do.

My family had a cat and she was awesome.

My brothers in the navy and whenever he‚Äôd come home she wouldn‚Äôt leave his side.

Shed sleep with him, keep him company if he was working on his car. She was a good cat.
Daawwww
okay it may be sweet, but cats are conniving no good furbabies. I am sure he is planing a malevolent plot against his owner 
I was in the hospital for a month this year and my cat didn't bat an eye at me when I got back
> "You're my favourite can opener"
They have each other now, go back to work 
SHPE?
"Hey, how was your conference?"
"Oh it was good, they had a suprise presentation about knocking over things and Chairman Meow made a video titled "5 ways to wake up your hooman that you won't believe!"
missed?? dont you mean replaced
God I wish this had sound.
Not sure if I want to be you or the cat 
Soooo cute! I wish my cat would cuddle up to me like that. The best I get is him sleeping on my bed lol.
obviously not, he prefers the cat.
Must be nice
I never thought a cat would be like this
I was gone for two days and the cat just looked at me, hissed, and went back to licking himself. 

What can I say, I‚Äôm loved. 
Good god dude, at first glance you were the Fortnite guy ‚ÄúNinja‚Äù. You definitely looked like him from the side.

Cool fuckin‚Äô kitty, dude.
Which one are you?
Is your cat a Siberian?  I have a Siberian and he looks literally like a clone of yours.  Plus he‚Äôs just as cuddly.
Meanwhile my cat only lays with me if create a bed for him between my legs and e barley ever does it anymore as it is :'(
Makin‚Äô biscuits
Such love. 
Somebody make a painting of this!
This is insanely cute. For real. That kitty adores you!!!  You made my day with this gif!!

Edit: and you are in Australia? I wanna steal the kitty. Oh and the cutie guy also :p
Best feeling in the world
‚ÄúI was away at a conference for two days. I think I may have been missed.‚Äù
Someone missed their daddy.  No more trips for you mister!
Awe! I love it when my babies make biscuits on me...I also get nose bumps.
And they say cats don't care.
 U need me, I knead u :‚Äô)
Actions are sweet and all but something about those eyes still makes me uneasy....
I hate that I‚Äôm allergic to cats and dogs. I am missing out on a huge aspect of life :(
He neads your cuddles
That tail... it's gorgeous 
Im jealous! My kitty hates cuddles
I love when cats do that with their paws üòç

I‚Äôm traveling for two weeks and even though i have a pet sitter, I hate being away from my boy, i hope he‚Äôs ok.  
My heart just melted
I don't know who looks more british, you or the cat
CATTO
Your human looks very happy that you‚Äôre back from your cat conference.
I'm about to leave my cat for 13 days and I'm so worried she will be so upset. We have a fantastic petsitter that she likes but I just really hope she knows we are coming back!!!
Pretty much my cat...sorry my owner...when I get home from work. First he insists on dinner, then he insists I lay down and provide pets. 

I am a well trained pet human. 
The snuggles üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Yes, *tenderize* the flesh. Soon, he will be in my floofy belly."
S/he kneads you. 
Atleast you don't get the butt end in your face like me üò∑
Awwwe the air paw knead is a great honor from a cat. They really, really love you üòò
High probability your presence was missed.

Nice! 

I am traveling for work for a week.

10/10 when I come home, my cat either ignores me or tries to claw my eyes out.
This makes my heart so happy!!
So wonderful!  We went on a week long trip and the neighbor took care of our kitty.  When we got back I got the lovins and while we are sitting there snuggling one big tear welled up and dropped down his cheek.  I have never seen a cat cry before.  I felt horrible for leaving for so long.
his back feetsies all up in the air..

Breed and Gender of the cat? I want a kitty like this !!!
This is so heartwarming

This. I travel for work. Typically 3-5 days at time. When I get home I fully expect to not sleep well for two nights because our cat likes to make sure my wife and I are actually home every few minutes. Whoever thinks cats are indifferent is nuts. 
This is...so cute Dx I LOVE CATS THEYRE SO CUTE.
It must be nice to have a cat love you 
r/kneadycats
You were! My kitty does this too, they are sweet creatures!
Your smile is as "aww" as your cat! Can definitely tell you're best friends. 
So cute.   My cats love to cuddle and lay all over me, but they don't knead.  This one cuddles AND kneads. That's the best of both worlds.
Oh man! How do you get so lucky to have such a cuddly cat!! Wish mine could be a tenth of your cuddliness, then I would probably die from joy :)
Is he a Siberian? 
Me missing nutting during NNN

I fckin die when they do the paw thing omfg 
My cat tries to be mad at me for leaving, but honestly it just makes her cuter. She tries to stay mad, but ends up stalking me nonetheless. Then after a bit she can't take it anymore and it ends up just like this.
Aww the lil paws are too cute! 

My girlfriend‚Äôs cat does the same thing. We call it ‚Äúmaking biscuits‚Äù lol 
Cuuuuuuuute!!!!
What sorta conferences does this kitty go to...? 
Awww, your fuzzy fren definitely missed you! üòÅ
He looks like this cat i fell in love with named Grimm at an animal shelter..
Look at that tail! Your cat is bizArro-my cat in terms of colors but both have a huge bushy tail and do that kneading.
This cat is on ex.
How does your cat show you such affection? My orange demon only comes to me for treats. And sometimes, she turns around and faces away from me.
They are so beautiful when they feel so calm and loved. Nice video. 
Love the feetsies!  LOVE!!!

Adorable
Lol I was gone for 9 hours and my cat decides to be attack me when I come home lol I still love him tho!
Looks like true Love.

Animals love for humans unconditional

My heart has just melted. Can someone tell me what breed that adorable kitty is?
This is me on my husband when he‚Äôs come back too. I try not to knead his breasts though. 
Oh my globbbbbbb this reminds me so much of my kitty I had to put down a few weeks ago. He was a big panther with glorious long fluffy fur, and he was an intense cuddled just like this guy. This made me smile cry. 
I miss you big G!!!
You know, it would be great if I could do that one day without getting itchy, tearing red eyes, congested, and sneezing non stop. Would be fun
You look *just* like my brother and it's sort of freaking me out. You're not, cuz he doesn't have a cat like that, but still. 
Well damn.  No lover is going to be able to compete with that cat.
Oh my god that fluffy baby. Gimme!
Does your wife know about this?
So sweet! Your cat definitely loves you!
Said the cat. 
Omg I‚Äôve never seen a cat be that affectionate. I love how much she loves you!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
This is the most wholesome thing I've seen in a while
Real men cuddle kittens!
What type of cat is that?
Never leave again m!
Look at that kneading 
You are kneaded!
This is a very special relationship. My cat would just act out. 
Our kitten is like this if we are gone for a few hours. He has two other cats to play with but he acts like we were never coming home. 
I‚Äôm reading the title as if the cat wrote it. 
My heart! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è You two are adorable!!!
This is just the sweetest!
I'm away for college and every time I go back home, my cat just walks past me like I don't exist. Wish I had that same love :(

I want someone to do that to me, for fucks sakes I want to feel that loved and wanted. 
Aww, I want a cat now. 
Lucky!  When I get home from a long trip, my cat runs around the house and craps on the bed. 
Thoze toez tho
Of this is cute aff 
Does anyone know why cats do that thing with their paws? I've never owned one but I'm sure I've seen this sort of thing before.
When I sit on the couch my cat jumps up next to me and rubs her head on my shoulder. 
Adorable!

I could be gone for a month and my cat wouldnt love me like this
Hey I'm all for death claws. I'd rather expect to get my throat slit in the middle on the night than mutilate a miniature predator. I just like seeing cats with claws
It‚Äôs literally me. 

I am the cat lol
who missed who?
GOOD KIT
Is that a lynx point? My cat is a lynx point and he is super affectionate as well.

Ha, my pet finally came back. The cat thinks, probably.
I might get a cat because of this.
Looks like you weren‚Äôt missed at all.
OMG. So Precious!!
Well, I feel missed when I even go to the bathroom. I spend all day with her, she sleeps in our bed but I close the bathroom door for 30 seconds and I'm a monster!
Cute little feet. 
Absolutely the best feeling is a kitty i missed you snuggle time!
So sweet! I love it!
Apart from my own kitty, this is the best thing I've seen all day. üíñ
Perhaps.
I get this being away for 10 hrs.
I think you just won the internets. 
This dried my tears for a bit today.  Thanks.  RIP Stan Lee
Two seconds later the cat told him to fuck off

Lol the cat is kneading, which means it is marking territory by the scent on its paws.
I want to date you

So lame dude. Come get a real pet. A dog maybe? Or I know how about a goldfish! 
I know this is a loving gesture. But cats kneading and purring creeps me out. I feel like they're trying to hit on you. I know it's weird and fucked up but I can't help it. 
I just read a paper on animal empathy. Apparently it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs winter and you are warm. Still adorable
Your girlfriend/wife might get jealous that you are giving all your cuddles to the cat. Hope you are single, fighting sucks.
Nevermind. Deleted. I am walking away in shame
Honestly find this disturbing. Everyone loves a cat molesting its owner. But a cat kneading the dough is
Kinda normal.  37+ for this ?! #oatmealcookies #ruined
