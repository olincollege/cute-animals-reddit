Radiation! Naw jk but we don‚Äôt have results of it being harmful and we only have 15 years of data. Which means that if 15 years of expose didn‚Äôt make us get sick. The cat will be fine as it lives less than that anyway. But hopefully for us there are no downsides to the wireless heat radiation in the future. Cross fingers.
Works great but there is a strange low frequency drumming sound coming from the unit.

That‚Äôs a pretty good one, you know. It‚Äôs got that good phone holdage, it‚Äôs big, so it won‚Äôt fall backwards, and it‚Äôs pretty comfortable. The only problems with this one, though, is that it‚Äôs very shaky, a little unreliable, and breaks pretty easily when you sit on it, so you will need to get a new one quite frequently.

Still though, that‚Äôs a solid 7/10 right there.

It really depends what you‚Äôre in the market for if you should buy this product or not. Cosmetics: easy 10/10. Functionality: 4/10 a lot of people‚Äôs don‚Äôt work well. Price point: depends where you buy.

Overall, if you‚Äôre in the market mostly for fashions sake - it‚Äôs an easy choice. But if you want a reliable product I‚Äôd look elsewhere.
5/7 perfection
What cat did you use to take the photo?
I have one just like that on my lap right now
You win

Good. I‚Äôd try but my one cat would chew on my phone

10/10!
9/10 The only flaw would be when the stand starts moving on its own, your phone would just fall...
Does anyone know what champions league game that is?

It‚Äôs PURRRRFECT

Purrfect
3/5 stars, the holder is loose and constantly moves inconveniently. There is also a strange purring noise when adjusting the grip and sensitivity of the device. Finally, DO NOT TAKE INTO SHOWER OR GET WET!!! I repeat NOT WATER FRIENDLY!!!
Lol cat wasn‚Äôt interested in Ajax vs Valencia? Who woulda thought

I think it looks purrrfect.
Is that Barcelona vs Inter?
‚ÄòEvery body wants to be a cat!‚Äô Is mine I mean it! So cute! Lol!
Purrfect.
I'll give him 100% PLUS!!

I think I might show this pic to my ginger-boy, 3 yr old Mason, and see if he is willing to hold my phone like this the next time I make a phone call to my niece to FACE TIME her....

On second thought, maybe not, I don't think "Mason" would stay that way for more than 1-2 minutes however, I could try bribery, that might work, you know homemade cat treats with Salmon in them? 

It's sure cute, thanks for sharing! ;)
10 out of 10, so cute!
100000/100000
HOW MANY PUNS
10/10

I rate it an 11/10 firstly because it's furry it's cute and it's convenient cause it can walk after you if you give it treats
