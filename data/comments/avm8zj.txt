That hand is all of us 
https://imgur.com/a/N84L9cq
Why do I relate to that hand so much?
The claw!
Hi Spike. I love you.
For some reason, I got a mental picture of him as a pit boss in a dog casino. I might be a little high.
If there’s anything Reddit taught me today, it’s that his smile actually means he’s extremely nervous and is scared as hell. Something something his ears are backward 
Look out for the hand, Spike!
“Give me it now!”

-That freaky hand 
What is the person trying to do with their hand?
Just for the record he is only about 4 and a half weeks old, momma was outside at the time. He kept trying to jump so my son in law was holding his hand out as a precaution in case he had to catch him real quick. 
Please give him everything he ever wants forever. i love him.
Oh. My. God.
Bow ties are cool. 
Tiny adorable doggo is tiny and adorable!
He know he handsome 
Hi Spike!! 💕
Bebop? 
I am smol pupper

In hands I lie 

My name is Spike 

I Has bow tie 
In B4 some one tells you he’s making that face because he’s scared or some shit. 
You wish you looked this good.
Also maybe he's not proud, he's smug. Like, "Yeah, I got this bowtie. Yeah, I'm freakin' adorable. What are you gonna do about it? Grab me? Sorry, don't think so." 
omg
So the velociraptor behind the cam wants a snack
That’s a drunken smirk if I’ve ever seen one. Was this taken on St. Patrick’s Day?
Who throwin up crip tho 
Hi Spike! Welcome! The world has lots of lovely trees to sniff and puddles to splash in. Enjoy its wonders. 
Hi Spike what's your dog's name?
Wow what a dapper pup! So handsome 
OH MY GOD I LOVE SPIKE SO MUCH
My heart is not strong enough for how cute this tiny dog is.
A handsome young man
He looks so proud 😍😍
little boss 
He’s such a good boy
I'm sure he'll be great friends with Jerry and together they'll beat Tom's ass
I need a back story to that hand
See ya later, space cowboy 
**SEE YOU SPACE COWBOY!**
It's dangerous to go alone

Congratulations on your recent Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, little feller!
Cute little guy looks like he's a handful, or two.

Hi Spike.  May you always have a caring and loving family.  God Bless your little heart. 💖
It should be illegal to be that cute. He's perfect.
I do believe this is the most adorable thing I have seen in days, nay, weeks! Excellent work, fellows.
STOOOOOOOOOOPPPP this is so cute, it hurts!
He's ready to celebrate St Patrick.
Don't let him drink too much.
what breed?
LORD HAVE MERCY I LOVE YOU SPIKE!!!!
That hand is going to be a huge meme. I’m calling it now. 
Why is someone using the force on him or on the person holding him?
Please post another of photo of spike in a few months' time! So cute! 
Fuckin xenomorph taking the picture
Tell Spike I’d die for him
Does everyone do that with ethere hand subconsciously 
Did you name h8m after the cowboy bebop? 
Is it just me or Spike kinda looks like Snoop Dogg?
“Little bow tie”... as if the tie isn’t wearing the dog 
IT'S THE CLAW!
See you, space pupper
What is  ***The Claw***  doing there?
When he gets older he's going to start smoking cigars.
Oh my gosh!!! So cute.
I always wondered what my dog looked like as a pup - I think this is it.
THE CLAW
Too bad about Master Hand photobombing the little guy. 
Black excellence
Oh no, it's the claw!!
What a fancy boi
That is good quality pup
I’ve never seen a cuter pup
Hello spike! I rate you 13/10 good boy
Chose the eagle fighting style for this enemy did you? Excellent choice! Surely you can defeat his fetching style 
Bow ties are cool
he lick your face. 

he take long nappers.

but most of all, he dresses dappers.
The claw!!!
His cuteness level, it's over 9000!!!!!!!
Okay so where can I get that jacket
The hand on the left scares me
That claw hand though. What happened after this pic was taken I wonder?
Is this Darth Vader meeting a puppy?
hey spike what’s ur dogs name
Hi spike !!!
Stoned af

I would die for Spike 💚
I would die for him
A true gentleman wears bow ties
Spike I’m your biggest fan
He’s doing his best, and always will.
GIVE HIM TO ME
bring him over to /r/caninemajesty and I will put him in the sidebar. Message me when and if you do.
Ah, yes, Spike, how do you do my fine fellow?
hi spike, you're my world
Omg, I grew up with a black dog named Spike, he looked just like this little guy, when he was a pup. No bow tie though
Look at that smug little boy
##hand
I would die for him. 
Spike is smiling 🤗 Darling!! 💖💗
He's making a Kermit face.
Omg, my pupper (well old man doggo) Spike passed away before Christmas, and he was a tiny pupper also, except he always looked angry. 
Spike's are the best 
I wish people would stop posting pictures of dogs and saying he"s smiliing or they're cute, when they are nervous.

Dogs aren't trophy pieces to show off and treat like toys.

And another thing that's been annoying me recently is people saying things like 'pupper', 'good boi' and 'bestest boi'. Seems like this thread is unknowingly posting pictures of dogs in stressed positions and saying it's cute.
That smug look on the dog. I am this dog's bitch.
So sweet 💗
Commissioner of the Saint Patrick’s Day Parade has been sworn in!
He looks so handsome!!! Such a good color on him <3
It’s howtobasic resisting his urges to pet the pupper

Hi spike!
That hand is terrifying. Fucking cover that thing, Napolean 
The most boring name a dog can have

I had a staffy called Spike. He was a very good boy! 
"Who is best boy? I is best boy."
I hate his little snarky smile. That stupid fuck thinks he can challenge me. I’ll crush you like seriously I’m not even joking. I did 10 years of spinjitsu you little shit. Fucking idiot. Fuck you . No seriously. 
Looks like mussolini
Ah, we know who's going to star in God father 4 now.
Naming your dog Spike is like naming your son Mike or John. Aka unoriginal af 
Make that face at 'em dawg!
He's so cute
“Little” bow?
I would die for you spike
Lost my dog, Spike, about a month ago now. 15 years. I'm glad someone else has chosen such a badass name for a doggo.
It was the smallest bow tie we could find 
Is he smiling? ❤️❤️

Keep him away from howtobasic lol
Ready and willing to accompany you to any black tie event (and steal the show!)
The claaaawwww
Spike is ALMOST ready for St. Paddy's Day. All he needs to go with that nifty little bowtie is one of those green derby hats- you know, with the rounded top. I can picture it on him with it sitting jauntily slightly askew on that adorable little noggin!
cute pupper. that hand, though (closet slowly starts to creak open) 
Hi Spike you are so handsome! Love you puppy. ❤
Haha 😄 bowtie looks so cute in his bowtie
That dog looks so happy in his bow tie. What a handsome young lad!

I'll pretend it's my hand. IT'S SO FLUFFY I'M GONNA DIEEEEE. 
Cursed hand.
That vicious cuteness just massacred my heart! That is so cute!

So cute!
The claw!

I thought the thumbnail was a large dog head.
Handsome 
You know actors named Michael could really re-invent themselves if they renamed themselves Spike. Like Spike Fassbender, Spike Douglas, Chad Spike Murray.
Ever see something so cute you just want to squeeze it? That hand knows what I'm talking about...
The hand though
Awww!
THE CLAWWWW!!!
Look at that handsome boi
The clawwww
Not to be dramatic or anything, but I'd fucking die for Spike.

That smug little smile. He know exactly how cute he is. 
OMG, OMG, OMG, he is soooooo smooool! My heart is melting. What breed is he?
I love him
To answer a few questions:

Mom is some kind of terrier, Dad is a border collie.

To those comments about the floor, this is a entry way/mud room. 

He is only about 4 and a half weeks old and this is one of the first times Mom left him to go outside by herself for a bit. He was not the happiest puppy as a result.

Thank you for the platinum, gold and silver awards! 
What a fancy little man 
The Claw! 
Overwhelmed by cuteness. Must boop snoot!
OMG...........I just died
That face!

Why he look like young Sheldon 
Hi spike, nice dog
Screen booped. No apologies.
Protect him from that demon hand please.

Oh my fucking god. I'm dying of the cuteness. He is the sweetest lil proud pup I've ever seen 
Hi Spike! What’s your doggos name?
That hand is very menacing
Hey Spike nice pup you got there 
I'll will literally give up Oxygen for this pupper.
Should get him to play volleyball...I'm sure he'd win all the games and maybe even have a movie made about him.
Oh he's adorable. You've started a trend you know..now you're going to have to keep this sweet boy in bow ties for life.

I just met you and I love you!

Ask me how I knew every comment would be about the hand and not the dog. Thanks, Reddit.
Thats my hand when someone brings Doritos to the party. 
The clllllaaaawwwww.
Hi, Spike! Your dog is cute!
O'Driscoll.
Can u pls post pics of spike everyday forever?
WE MUST PROTECT SPIKE AT ALL COSTS 
Oh my goodness, what a precious little fella!
That hand is showing clear signs of cuteness aggression.
This isn't gonna be that cute, there are dogs with bowties online all the time-- *oh no!!* 

I don't think the world deserves this puppy, but goddamn I'm glad we got him.
Now wait until he falls asleep in a punch bowl.
Don’t want to be that guy but I saw another post with a puppy with the same “smile” and they said it was indicating the the puppy was super nervous and was showing several signs that it was in distress. I hope I’m wrong. 
Hi spike!  Now whats the pups name??
Aaannnddd the zombie hand...
Why do we love dogs but murder pigs?
I am screamgigglecrying because this is SO FUCKING CUTE OH MY GOD
Cute now but let's check in in 10 months...

I NEED TO DRAW IT
Welcome. You gonna die and rot like the rest of us. Also, anything you are gonna do in life won't mean anything. 

Enjoy!
