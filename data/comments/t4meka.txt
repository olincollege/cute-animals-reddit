Those claws though
This is simultaneously adorable and absolutely terrifying.
Nobody tell him.. let him live his best life.
Ok but that first husky looks like he has male pattern baldness lmaooo

Edit: Thanks for the awards. Glad I made everyone’s day
Where the heck is this? Is she selling ice cream? What the heck.
Family used to have a pet deer that thought it was a cow.
What is the matter with your dog
Seems to be a very, very, bad idea.
LMAO. THE dog(bear) had a really funny face when he got pushed in the face
I'm pretty sure that's a Newfoundland /s
Jesus Christ those claws. Bear cub could rend those dogs pretty badly from merely playing with them.  

Cute? Yes. Scary as hell when knowing this is *just a cub??* Hell yes.
OK, kinda funny, but is it really that smart to put your hand into a bear's mouth?
He's new here - just bear with him.
I'd be more concerned about looking for his mum than filming right now.
how can he be so cute and absolutely terrifying at the same time, i want to give him a hug so much then you see the claws
This bear is going to have to end up in a zoo or a sanctuary. It can't be kept as a pet, and it shouldn't be released into the wild because of its apparent comfortableness and familiarity with humans. It's cute now, but I worry towards its future.
I will tell him he is a dog.  You trim his nails.
ahhhhh forest pupper
Fuzzy? Ears? Snoot that needs boopin'? Looks like a dog to me.
Holy shit!! That’s Paddington! Hurry, give him marmalade
Bear: Dude it's my time for pets.. dude....
This video gave me so much anxiety !
You don’t decide if he’s a dog, he decides if he’s a dog.
Dogs have accepted him as a dog so he is a dog.
However this is possible, this is amazing.
Shhhhh, he must never know.
Yeah that's it...put your hand inside the bears mouth...what's the worst that can happen?
Well, bears *are* a part of the Caniformia which are a classification of animals that are dog or dog-like to an extent. So, by technicality, he is a dog.
Canidae and Ursidae are closely related on the Mammal family tree!
I bet the dogs get pissed when he stands on two legs and swats, what an advantage.
That 🐻cub is going to be “man’s best friend”
Well, think of it this way. Not many people are fortunate enough to know in advance how they are going to die. Good luck.
Hey Boo Boo

![gif](giphy|kiPAvaBL9hIoLAhl9j|downsized)
Cute until the bear starts acting like a bear…
fat dog for midterms!
those claws are horrifying lmao
Say they raise this baby bear up to adulthood with human contact, would it be safer or more dangerous than a chimp that is also raised by humans?
But what's the end game here? Like when it's a 600 lb bear...
What are you doing dude? That's a fucking bear. You need to 86 this bear, because...it's a bear.
Well, yeah, it's cute. But also very dangerous for the dogs. A dog may trigger the cub with something, then you have no more dogs.
He's just a puppy, for now.

His momma will tell him when she shows up to whoop yo ass.
Omg, those ears!!! Cutie
I think he wants a marmalade sandwich.
wym i see 4 adorable puppers
Where’s the mother?
Walks up to the coffee counter:

Can I get pupachino for my frien and a bear claw for me?
Does anyone have the faintest idea where this is and what’s going on? This entire video has me perplexed
His instinct will when he gets hungry or angry enough.
I wish I could be affectionate with bears without having to worry about my safety. Beautiful creatures.
I think the truth would be un-bear-able...
Behold! Dog!
It’s all fun and games till it’s a full sized bear. Hell even before then.
Who's going to tell him this is not a pet
I'd be scared for the dogs he is a beast!
Unless he’s a special “midget bear” I don’t see this story ending well.
I’m not telling him shit, look at those claws even tho he’s a baby
Probably his mother. When she comes and eats all of the real dogs.
Look at those scary nails 💅
OMG, that « nono!  Get awaaaay » push.  I just can’t 😍
All fun and games until Fido there is disemboweled
What the fuck. This is a terrible idea and you're being a bad dog owner by allowing this.
[removed]
How does one aquire a bear in this situation?
Aw, was the bear cub abandoned by its momma?  :(
He’s a bully tho 😂
pretty sure this was an episode of We Bare Bears
Those claws ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grimacing)
What type of dog is that black dog that tries to bite the bears ear?
dog: are you a dog?

bear: are you a bear?

both: yes
idk what to say
Fat Dog for Mid-Terms
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)May not be a dog, but they’re all a bunch of mouth breathers. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|smile)
Damn look at those claws, and he’s just a baby!
That is a baby and it's claws are nearly the size of your fingers. I'm just sayin
That’s a nice looking German Pinscher in the background. Not sure where this is but we don’t see them around much in the States.
I predict that half a dog will go missing under mysterious circumstances in the not-too-far future.
Eventually he’ll remind you himself he’s not a dog. Maybe when he eats the dog.
NOBODY! don’t break that poor bears heart
"lol but for real when I grow up I'm gonna rip out your intestines and feed them to my children"
Fun fact! Bears, dogs , and raccoons are in the same suborder of species called Caniformia. The more you know!
The dogs in a few months time we he gets so big and powerful he’d be a hazard to thrm
He’ll figure it out…when he gets bigger…and hungry.
That’s cute until the Bear grows up a little more and one day bites one of the dogs a little too hard and the dogs attack it then the bear goes on a killing spree on your dogs
Bears are a perfect combo of a human and a dog. There, I said it.
Sooooo!!!! Unsafe ! Where's Mom? This should have been a quick trip to Jesus. A met a guy who lost part of his arm to a cub a third of the size of the one in the clip. He thought it was cute, until it wasn't.
Razor claws
Will that mf eat the dogs?
Wow so many people here have seen The Secret Life of Pets but not enough have seen Grizzly Man. This is not going to be cute when it comes back and it weighs more 600 pounds. Leave nature alone or else nature wont leave you alone. When a 600 lbs bear starts prowling through a neighborhood, it eventually ends up euthanized. This moment is cute, but there’s nothing cute about the deadly consequences for the innocent bear and others put at danger here. This bear and his friends will come back around when they are all huge and hostile.
What happens when the cute little bear that thinks it a puppy still trys to be a puppy at 1400lbs. And tries to play swipe someone?
Who’s ganna try tell ME he’s not a goodboiiii
The better question is :who is going to break it to the dogs that their buddy isn't one?
Game warden will. He's going to get big enough to take those dogs out with one swipe of his paw, and habituating wild animals to the presence of people never works out well for the animal...
Those claws kinda give it away.
This is like a cute version of r/actlikeyoubelong

Or atleast it was till I saw those claws. Yikes.
Ahh till he kills your dogs
I want to meet these people who don’t shit their pants.
Don't tell him, you'll just make him pupset.
I needed to see something like this today, thank you for sharing this awesome moment
His mama
Uhh not me not you or the dogs
Is this another “Russian defector” thread?
If not friend, why friend shaped?
I love how the bully(or is that a black lab?) Does not give a fuck about the bear. It's just like, "no dude, it's my turn for treats"
A bear and pit bull dogs? Who are you?
He’s a dog until he gets pissed.
Awful and stupid. This is how you get bears killed when they become too familiar with humans
I sure as hell ain't gonna tell him
r/murdermittens
#savevideo
he'll find out once he accidentally rips that hand off.
I think he'll figure it out when he decides to eat one of his friends
Another bear!
Scritches are wanted by all animals I guess
Looks like one good boy to meee
All fun and games until it fucks up your pets.
Wait till he gets a lil too frisky with those paws and ladies and gentlemen, we’ll have damages.
Really?  Aren’t you afraid that one day when you wake up, all the dogs disappeared?
He’ll find out later in life when he accidentally crushes one of them
ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ
He's very selfish. 
"No! Go away. Only ME gets pets" *shoves dog*
I feel like those dogs are having anxiety like holy duck get me out of here with this bear.
Look at those wicked claws! 😳
Technically bears are related to dogs
He's still a canid.
I admit I didn't read all the comments, but surely someone has mentioned the problems of keeping wild animals as pets?  Around here they say "a fed bear is a dead bear".
That Husky noped out quick. THATS a smart boyyeee.

And he stood by the door like.. Y'all faukin with that bear?
These guys have some cool looking dogs
The Coroner???
He's going to tell everyone in a really violent way..... one day... when he feels like it.
This just looks unsafe for everyone involved. The Bear, the doggos, the human.
I don't want to be that guy but Jesus this is questionable at best. Paws and hands went into its mouth WAY too many times for comfort. Mostly because bears are going to bear, eventually.
Lets just hope that claw never gets angry
He’s not a dog. He’s a BULLY.
Tell him when he's older. Doubt he could...bear it right now.
What is the cost of paying for pet food? The butcher must be happy
If he thinks he is a dog , don't spoil his day
Omg🥺
But he looks like such a good boy
If he thinks he is a dog, so be it!!
Nobody, absolutely nobody tell him.
Bear cub is very much competing for whatever the human has (food/attention/etc) with the dogs. It tries to nip and the dog’s paw and push the dog away. I hope they curb that behavior so it doesn’t escalate.
That’s bear-y cute.
Woods Pupper
Looks like a good boy to me
Till it gets a taste for them doggos
That's a Ukrainian Brown Retriever
She pulled her hand out of his mouth real quick lmao
There are a lot of social media influencers who have adopted really dangerous animals as babies to raise as their gimmick. I really hope that’s not what this person is doing.
Dogs are so cute. They just don’t care it’s a bear cub. They see it as one of their own. 🥰
What could possibly go wrong?
His hunger might.
The amount of pure bred dogs in this video SICKENS me.
The age will tell the owners
He will tell you when he eats the dogs
If nature wanted me to fear bear, then why bear so friend shaped?
I don’t know about telling the bear he’s not a dog… but someone better tell his owners pretty quick or they will be short a few dogs soon
When the bear kept trying to gnaw for the persons hand and the dogs paw tho!! This video gave me so much anxiety!
RIP doggos
I would just like to point out how profoundly stupid this is.
If bear dangerous, then why friend shaped?
Why would you you have a nee dog
didn't know xi jinping is on vacation
No one. And no one better tell him because if he wants to be a dog then he is a dog
u/savethevideobot
I bearly noticed it
He’ll know once all the dogs are all dead.
You have to speak with his mother over this behavior
Just give him a marmalade sandwich for god's sake...
Yea alright, but doesn't play nice, does it? Trying to push the dog out of the way.
Who is going tell the others, that he is a bear 😅
Tell me it's Russia without telling me it's Russia.
Nah thats a doggo
Those claws could gut you.
Nobody gunna tell him okay 🥺🥺 he raised with the doggie pack so he is one at heart awww ❤❤
In the wild bears and wolves sometimes work together.
Bears r genetically related to dogs. Dude just visiting his cousins
Not me. Him’s the goodest boy.
If he ever gets mad and gets into a fight with one of his brother dogs, those claws will let the dogs know that he's not a dog
"He a little confused but, he go the spirit."
How big will it get before it thinks "I can eat these fuckers" and then proceeds to do so?
Those meat shredders are a massive no go for me.
Probably some bitch will.
Don't be suspicious
Are you assuming his species
Bro that's like saying your kid is not your son because he's adopted
Forest puppy!
That's kind of missed up! And sadly this kind of animals would need to spend the rest of their life in rehabilitations or sanctuaries!
Where there's a bear cub, there's a mama bear
The hysterical thing to me is that the dogs think he is a dog.
This looks like one of those cute today, problem tomorrow scenarios
Don’t think he can bear the news
I would be a little scared for the dogs to be fair
Where do I sign up to get one of these?  🧸
Look, real talk here, how exactly do I go about getting one of these bears?
"Mommy mommy,  can we keep him?"
The goodest doggo
I want a bear as a pet now
Am I the only one noticing those claws?
I was once in Santa Fe, NM, walking next to the riverbed at dusk. I see these two dogs come up the bank and start playing and rolling around and a big dog behind them. 

Bears.  They were bears. Me standing there with my toddlers watching the dog bears play under the streetlight.
What you mean, he is a dog.
Kid, I hate to tell you... but you're adopted.
He belongs
Had such a crappy day, I really needed this
2 years from now, a 900 pound bear with the mentality of a black lab.  Good luck getting him off of the remains of your couch.
Idk what ur talking about I only see dogs there
Its bearly noticeable
He's going to be the biggest bestest boi.
He’s still A GOOD BOI though.
The best thing you can do with a bear is stay away from it. Feeding it will encourage the bear cub to seek food from other humans and will eventually end up in tragedy.
Remember no matter how cute bears are they are not dogs. It’s not going to remember you being a friend like a dog.
I really hope this bear wasn't purchased, what's the story behind it? If it's wild then you got a huge problem if the mom comes around, especially if you're trying to pet a wild animal like a dog, which endangers both the animal and yourself because it won't fear people. I wish this Sub was more careful about allowing videos of people interacting with wild animals like this, or people posting videos with animals used for entertainment. It sends such a bad message out.
That is NOT Awww behaviour.

### That bear cub is consistently taking that dog’s paw in its maw in an attempt to be the only one to get food-attention-what have you.

That is NOT Awww.

![gif](giphy|26gsdHyUukCzB5x96|downsized)
OMG....That's so cute!
Wild animals be very bitey, and I'm pretty sure that hand would have been injured if left in the cubs mouth like that bears(cubs) have different bite force.
That bear is going to really hurt one of those dogs at some point. Even if its by accident playing around, hes so much stronger than them, and since its a brown, hes not done growing.
Man I love bears
"You're adopted"
That’s just a weird looking lab!  Let him live his best life!
How many of you think this is cute, but get mad about pitbull posts?
I love your pack so much.
Why is there a bear there in the first place?? It’s cute when it’s small… but soon that bear will be huge… and playing could get dicey.
Terrible service. Should have hooked up Paddington with his marmalade right quick!
No one because he’s beyond adorable.
Where’s mama?
This is actually like. Not good. Shouldn't be getting that acclimated to humans that young.
He's a good boy, and that's what counts.

In Korea, we had a Preying Mantis in the barracks-- also a good boy.  Not even kidding.
Do bears normally pant? Or is it mimicking the dogs? That would be cool
All I see are a bunch of dogs?
It’s all cute and adorable until mama bear finds her cub and destroys everyone.
I would mostly be worried about where his momma is
Plz tell me this is a orphaned bear cause id be scared of the mom coming and killing these dogs.
He’s just looking for his bare necessities.
Careful. Where there’s a baby bear, there’s a momma bear
A grizzly??? A black bear I could understand. Never a grizzly.
Omg what a sweet surprise! Pls stay that small and cute 😭
That’s one *creepy-looking* *”dog”.*
He can be dog if he wants
Can't wait to see the news story about this bear being utilized because it won't leave people alone or ate this person.
That bear is clearly a good boy. And all dogs are good boys. Therefore, the bear is clearly a dog.
🥰🥰🥰
🥰😍
I’d be careful the momma bear’s gotta be somewhere close
Aww he's enjoying that.
Aww!
What do you mean? I see five very good puppers
Uhm...
...don't tell him how to live his life
Man they have some serious claws
Danger Doggo
I wonder if it likes dog biscuits.
To be fair, they are caniforms.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes_rainbow)
he can be an honorary dog
Of course this is a dog.  The breed is the very well known "Affection Hound".
But he's so cuute...
Nobody should tell him a damn thing
They remind me of siblings vying for their parent’s attention, haha!
You see comrade, in Mother Russia, bear is dog no?
Oh....ummmm.yes......bork bork
With those claws not me.
b e a r- wait i mean d o g
He can be a dog. He seems very polite.
What the dog doing?
Wholesome n cute af!🥰
So cute! 😍😍
That's a Russian dog of some sort.
I would not. Also, wouldn’t tell his mom. I hear bear moms are really jealous.
Him IS dog now.
Must pet
This made my day thank you giving me the biggest smile I have in a while 😊😊😊
I was expecting a turtle
You can bearly see the difference!
I think they all think they’re hoomans and they’re ordering fast food.
What country
They're actually pretty closely related. They have a common ancestor and there used to be dog-bears and bear-dogs.
The world needs more of this
Feed him some salmon brains, as a treat
Not gonna find out from me.
I see no problem here. Only good boys
That would be unbearable.
This is the best. You have GOT to post more videos of your bear interacting with your dogs!
If he's at at doggy daycare he IS a dog.
Just a few genetic mutations away
Don't you dare!

I think he’ll realize that soon.
Looks like an origin episode of "Gentle Ben", shows how old I am.
He is a forest puppy!
If not friend why friend shaped?
Shut up shut up shut up he is the BEST dog and and you best be petting him
Yo I’m screaming wtf! Pit bulls saying “funny looking husky muthafucka”
Awe a real life teddy bear
Who's gonna tell the other one that he is not a bear?
A wet nose is a wet nose.
Where in the fuck does someone get a bear??? Like “Just me and my dogs, chillin with the bear”…

Bears and dogs are closely related aren’t they?

Who’s gonna tell the bear or the dog?
He's just after a small smackeral of honey
He’ll find out for himself soon enough.
Weird looking dog you have there.
He's a good boy
Uh ... not me.

Good luck buddy! (Bill Pullman, Independence Day)
I thought that was a kid with a bear costume head
If not pet then why friend shaped?
Why isn't this like 2 hours long?! I demand it be so!!
Unbearably cute
that’s kinda cute though
See that bear living like dogs and it becomes one of there own
That is the cutest "dog" ever, minus the claws. Oh and that Doberman, love those.
r/MaybeMaybeMaybe
With claws like that, I'll call him whatever he wants.
In about a year or so, he'll tell YOU 🤣
I wouldn't. I don't think he could *bear* to hear such news.
I have a black lab and I can attest he wouldn't give a fuck if there was a bear, lion, rhino, or other around, if I had food in my hand he would be doing this too.
It’s all fun and games until someone loses an eye.  👀🧸

Wow, too awesome!!!!!!
When you name your dog "Bear" and you really mean it
Good *god* why do bears have to be so goddamn *cute*. Look at those fuckin' ears when he pops up! RRRRGH! And I just wanna BOOP. THAT. SNOOT.
It's so fluffy I could die!
I nly see a bunch of good boys.
I only see a bunch of good boys.
If dangerous, why cute and fluffy🤨
At one point I thought bear was going to talk!
I just want to pet him…
So cute!
Those claws though…man one bad swipe and it’s All Dogs Go to Heaven 3
I fucking won't. Brother Bear wants to be  a dog? Fuck it, he's a dog.
I like how the bear could easily win that fight, but opts to nudge doggo out the way with a mild headbutt.
😂
That's a wierd looking dog
He's a good boi too.
That bear learned how to talk dog.
Tell momma bear... cause when she finds out shes gonna be pissed
This is my Disney World.
😪😪😪😪😪😪😪😪👿👿👿👿
A bear raised by dogs is going to think that it's a dog.
Tell one of the dogs to do it.
This is cute but also terrifying. If it happened to me I'd be desperately trying to get my dogs inside before the momma bear comes around and enters the rage state. Filming wouldn't even occur to me
I ain’t telling him shit you seen his claws?
Cute pupbear.
HAHAHAHAHAH but it looks cute
cute now.  not going to end well.
Please keep him fed for the sake of the doggos

HAHAH suddenly a wild bear appears! So good.

Hes just a thick puppo, Id give him a pet!
He’s cute though
Ok I wanted to get a goat, noooooowww I guess I need a bear.
I think he knows he’s a dog, everyone else involved doesn’t seem to realize that is a damn bear!

Hes a DAWG
Aww, he looks like Paddington!
I'm not going to, I couldn't bear that ):
Puppy!
Awww he'd probably make a nice crock pot soup
time
But he’s so cute though
I call: NOT IT!
No one! Leave that dog alone! 😂
Big doggie
I definitely won’t I would love to have a bear as a dog he wouldn’t eat me if he thought he was a dog
this is so fucking cute
I dont mean to be an asshole, but is there any risk of a bear like that hurting them? Those claws look pretty mean and I imagine the teeth are pretty gnarly as well. Even though it's probably been in the care of humans since it was a cub, are they dangerous?
Nice claws
Don’t you dare
Wow.
Uhhhh where mom?
But he's a dog!
I would have been terrified
I mean they are all canines though.   


Wait nvm wtf I thought bears and dogs were closely related enough but not really.
This made my day ❤️❤️❤️
Omg I love it
That’s Barry from the country bears
Posting for visibility
lol i  love how innocent this is
aww I want one
Oh this reminds me of a story I read a while back of a Chinese family that bought a dog(or so they thought) but it just kept growing till they took it in to get looked at and turned out it was a bear
Bear with it—-
*"The other window has a lady who feeds you carrots."*
Do the dogs know? Like by the smell or posture or something? Or are they totally going on with the vibe
So cute!!
Ayo bluh u got a bear near ur window
I can’t stop watching this.
Do you mean the Bear, or the dog trying to hump the Bear?
I met some grizzly cubs, they were basically the size of a full grown dog but the energy of a puppy.
Nobody, nobody is gonna tell him
Don't u dare...tell him
Stupid question:  At why point does this baby become dangerous to be around? I mean, it’s a baby, and it can already tear shit apart. Very cute, doe.
I think he will tell you..
/savevideo
He’ll realize it once he puts an eye out with one of those claws!
Not me. That’s a new breed of dog.
Amazing.  Looks like a slice of heaven.
Who’s gonna tell him he’s not though?
Looks like a dog to me!
Will be interesting when Mum comes looking for him
Why are you gatekeeping? Let him be a dog all he wants!!
Well, ACTUALLY bears and dogs are part of the same/similar family tree, canine.
He *seems* super friendly. Are the dogs safe playing with him? At what age will you release into wild?
r/aww feels more like r/makemeanxious today
Time will tell
Don’t, let his dreams come true.
Well not the udder dogs
Doesn’t even look real! As if Paddington n Winnie made thick in the warm and out popped this fur ball.
He’s just happy to be here and they’re just happy to have him
Yeah I don't think I could put my hand in a bear's mouth even though I love them. Although I doubt it's too much more dangerous than putting your hand in a dog mouth
Can someone tell me that even after growing will it be in Harmony with dogs like that?
You leave him alone!
Awesome. Where’s the mommy though ??
Bro is the big dog
You’re looking for a liar? I see nothing but perfect puppos!
Though, dogs are the closest species to bears.
Omg those ears

**Where is Momma Bear!? It is important to know where MOMMA BEAR is!**
Oh great. Bear is going to be acclimated to humans and will eventually be euthanized as he breaks into houses looking for food or attention
Who’s gonna tell the dogs that its not the dog
If not fren, then why fren shape?
I hate how cute bears are. Like it’s like pique predator tactic.
Pronoun is dog and living it’s best life!
I couldn’t BEAR to tell him he’s not
If we could selectively breed wolves into dogs, how come we haven't done the same thing to bears to make like alive teddy bears or something.
I couldn’t BEAR to break the news to him
I'm not going to tell him
Aw I really really needed that, thank you

Aww!! So cute, my husband would love this, he loves dogs...
What you mean he’s not a dog?? He’s the goodest boi of all!!
Don't break his heart ..he just wanna be a good boi
Probably safer not to.
I’ll tell him when he’s 800lb bigger
Godspeed keeping this as a pet.

Cute as it is. 😍  It is a terrifying idea to me.
You, or you are dead.
I don't care, im bringing him in
He's with his cousins that's all
Frend :>
This is  fucking adorable fuck!!!!! thank you for sharing! 😎👌🏼
But still a good boy
How adorable and terrifying at the same moment, gotta appreciate those moments
Damn Russians!!
I'm  not gonna tell him
Im gussing he nust been rescue cub
lol the bear looks like he is made from animatronics
Help! I can't stop watching this cuteness overload lol
Hey op crazy question but do you know the breed of the black dog at ~40 seconds left? My dog is a spitting image and I have no idea
I know its an awful idea but I would love to have a pet bear.
So cute
fuck, now I wand a pet bear cub
Who's the GOODEST boi
Hank the Tank in his younger years!
Don't tell him, he wouldn't be able to bear it.
Awww 🥰
It’s sad seeing someone live your dream. Now is your chance.. hold him 🥺
all i see is a big brown doggo. whats wrong?
His mom will tell him. And neither you nor the dogs want to be around for it, so get the hell outta dodge.
Cuter than dog
Sure as fuck not me
Save video
Awww so cute
Awwwwwww
You do it.
Every human bean who quoted Monty Python here deserves congratulatory oral. 

Congratulatoral?


C'mon Reddit, let's make this a thing!!
I want one
A Doja Cat or donkey down the road mighta did
Now that pretty cool 😎
bear
Russian Dog
Best way to raise a bear is to raise it with dogs
I was expecting to see a turtle based on the title.
No one dares! Too cute
Can’t tell if this is some sort of rescue/sanctuary or just Russia.
So adorable!!!!!
In 1 year, "on this episode of Clifford the big brown bear dog"

Is this a brown bear?? Black bears are basically big dogs but brown bears, they're bear bears.
If it was me I’d let him think he’s a dog for ever in fact I’ll make him believe he’s a lab or a golden retriever 😅
Do you clip or dull is adorable talons?
nobody tell him
Henlo. Is dog frend, need treats.
Top dawg
Bear just wants to be the center of attention
Y U NO GIVE THEM TREATS YOU JUST BAITING THEM
He doesn’t need to know that
Is this a rescue bear or did he just show up in the yard?!!
Thats either a baby or a really small one. Is he orphaned? Where's mama?
Nobody tell him nothing!
and why would you do that? 😑😑
Don't you have any doggo spirit left? 😱😱
Just don't stand there, give him a Milk-Bone.

Yeesh
Wait six months and then you tell him.
Not me i love him so much
That is a very cute yet terrifying dog if i ever seen one. Still would pet it
He will when he’s bigger and see your dogs as a meal source.
Maybe it’s just because the sight is so unusual, but this doesn’t look real to me. The bear’s movements seem just slightly unnatural, almost like it’s CGI. But again, it could just seem that way because I’m not used to seeing a bear cub playing with dogs
Adorable
I love him
If dogs don't care then I don't either.
It’s crazy how nature works. The way you grow up regardless of species is so important and can shape your entire identity. It’s incredible.
Looks like a puppy to me
No one cause he’s adorable ❤️😂
Say what you will that’s a beautiful pup;)
Don’t you dare tell him that… it’ll break his heart to find out
Bears are the ultimate animal
I be more terrified of where the momma was, then cure baby. They're not usually far away
What happened to it's mom? Is the cub just visiting or was it human/dog raised? It's so cute how the dogs are friendly with it.
No way I'm telling him
his mom
Cutie
Bear: I identify myself as a dog
They all look so happy!
And that was the last time we saw that man. Where is the momma?
Bears beat Battle Star Galactica.
Who's gonna tell the dogs they aren't bears?
Big paw boi
Made me smile
Don’t you dare.
It’s Paddington bear
Awwwww he's just a cute little puppy bear 😍
I would never ever put my hand in a bear's mouth.

That's some crazy thing to do.

The vid is otherwise aww but so risky
I’m not gonna tell him, he might be small now but soon….
It's cute until it gets big and grown up...
Haven't seen comments on it so i'm assuming i'm wrong but is this animated or is the video throwing my brain off?
All caniforms though
Well….they *are* (distantly) related.
Human brain: Look at the snuggly baby I just want to pick him up and hug him.

Monkey brain: Bear cub means mama bear nearby, bear has claws, bear eat dumb monkey. Do not touch baby bear abort abort!!!
Friend is friend.
Sir, there is a bear in your house.
