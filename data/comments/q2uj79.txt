I adore your dog and would gladly take a ball to the head for the opportunity to play fetch with him.
tankdogs will now take over the world. What have you done?
Genuine laugh achieved
Totally worth the black eye.
Human too lazy to throw? Just bounce it off them, it‚Äôs pretty much the same thing. This pup has it figured out.
my dog when I was growing up used to grab the end of a shoelace...any shoe would do...and swing around with it till it got some speed and then launch at you. Took several to the face.
You either throw ball or I throw it at your face - Best boi
No take, only throw.
I have truly never seen or even heard of a dog doing this before. Legitimately hilarious.
Your dog is one of the cutest pups I‚Äôve ever laid eyes on.
This is amazing!
In Mother Russia, dog throw ball for YOU!
I think it is *your* turn to go fetch! Now fetch!
Aww, he's playing catch with you.
*I thought you said your dog did not bite!*

*That is not my dog.*

https://youtu.be/ui442IDw16o
"I SAID I WANTED TO PLAY FETCH. NOW FETCH, HUMAN!" -dog
That's talent.  That upward curve ball over the head and his reaction just kills me. 

Finally! A dog that can play catch with himself. 

Needs Batman (TV) sounds. Kerpow! Bif! Splat! Blap!
What a fantastic lil dude!
Now, that is one smart and playful pooch‚Ä¶ bless you poochyüíü
What a bully!
LoL God that's awesome
Impossible to be angry at that face
Once saw a woman do something similar with a ping pong ball.
Now you have a working turret for your front lawn
Cutest Nerf gun ever.
The only thing that can stop a bad guy with a gun is a good boy with a ball.
Wow, that is a good catcher.
Does he play fetch with other dogs?
what a silly doggy
The sound on the last one is so satisfying üòÇ
It's just a long range bite if you really think about it
Proof that other species also have jerks.
Lookit his squishy little face :D
He's glad to dome you, what did you do to him??? ü§£ü§£
Does he bite? No, but he can hurt you in other ways.
You need to get him a baseball cap, yourself a baseball glove, and go outside and play catch!
Now release him into the wild so he can breed with strays and teach this behavior to the rest of the population.
This is hilarious!!! Never seen a dog do that before!
He be poppin
this made me laugh so damn hard.
I'm pretty sure this gives new meaning to "going ballistic".

Aaah, I see you got yourself the Bullpup model, very fine piece of artillery, chases and scrounges it's own ammo, so you never have to worry about reloading!
Pew pew
This is the best thing I've seen in days, thank you!
‚ÄúFetch, mother$&?@/!!‚Äù

-dog
lol now this is something right out of an alternate reality ala Rick and Morty - you wake up. . .you do the long yawn....you open your eyes to this cute but obviously deadly beast towering over you with the ball in its mouth. Not moving...just breathing....you wait...."Is this it..is it over?" . . . . . . .squeak!
Rottweiler bulldog mix?
This is one of the best things ive ever seen
This video is amazing as is your dog.
What a cute little jerk!
Now *you* fetch
Straight up, I would die for that pup
You‚Äôre gonna play ball whether you want to or not.
What did you do to deserve this
Human- "Fetch pupper"

Dog- "hahahahah, got it, now your turn!"

Human- "my turn!?!?"
That‚Äôs a real talent!
Anyone know a brand for the balls? My dog would love chewy balls that keep their shape like that.
such a cute dog :) what breed is he/she?
House llama.
Never seen a dog spec into ranged stats before, a bold strategy
"No, he's ranged."
‚Äú Hey - * BONK * wake up * BONK * I gotta play! * BONK * ‚Äú
this is actually a gun, that consumed a devil fruit
Don't underestimate the ninja doggo.
Learned?  Based on the video footage of say the dog was trained to fire projectiles...
dog graduated from fetch, and can now play catch.
Fuck!  I think my dog just saw this.
What a doll!
Holy crap the dog learned how to throw and is playing reverse fetch
Bulldogs are too fucking cool üòé
Is that a rottie, bulldog mix? Holy fuck is this pupper adorable!
Our Boston does similar. He can pelt someone in the face with a soggy toy from across the room.

Full head swing though. Also plays catch with himself by tossing up.
My dog does this too because he's lazy. When we play fetch, he just drops the ball anywhere and watches as you walk over, get it, walk back and throw it again. Finally my mom had enough and refused to play with him until he brought the ball all the way back. After a few times he learned she would stop playing with him if he didn't walk all the way over to her with his ball. So now he  just spits it out and lets it roll/fly at us ha ha
Fore information it a bulldog
"You have a bulldog?"

"No, I have a balldog. New breed."
This is a new breed of dog!  There‚Äôs the retriever, the pointer, and now THE LAUNCHER!  I could watch this video all day.
My dog used to do the same thing! When I was a kid it was my favorite game, running around trying not to get hit by the ball. She would chase my brother and I around the house with it and you never knew when it would come flying out of her mouth üòÇ. Thanks for unlocking that memory.
Shpong ü•∞
Is his name Nerf?
Wait. Wait.

Train him to do that from a distance. Play catch with your dog.

Please. For the internet.
Evolution.
Is that the dog from one piece arabasta arc (lasaoo)
Oh dear‚Ä¶ our dogs better not ever get together and conspire. Mine is getting extremely good at short tossing a ball into my lap or open hand if I‚Äôm ignoring him while he wants to play. Add my dog‚Äôs aim to your dog‚Äôs projectile skills‚Ä¶ they‚Äôd be unstoppable!

My boxer, dachshund mix does something similar!  He flings his head to the side with some damn break neck force and beams it at me though.

Literally did this once at 3 am.  Peacefully sleeping and then ....CRACK! Rope toy upside the head.
That‚Äôs a smart ass dog.
He‚Äôs too powerful now
In Soviet Russia the dog throws the ball.

This makes me happy.
He's gotta have a good name! What's his/her name?
I had a Shih Tzu that used to do this, only he'd launch the ball down the hallway and play fetch with himself after I got tired of throwing the ball.

I had just rescued my St Bernard and while I was at work she forced open a window that was open a crack and she got out of my apartment. My neighbor (a dog sitter) talked to me when I got home and said she caught her and pushed her back in the window and closed it and told me that my new dog had not bitten her but had "squeezed her butt with her teeth." 

Fast forward 5 years and my rescue is a good girl and no longer squeezes butts.

Not too different from my dog when she was mostly still a puppy. We got her these little balls that were covered in like these thin, fairly durable plush animal designs with little ears, arms and legs sticking out. Well on one of them, a brown bunny, had longer ears than the other one which I think was a grey koala toy. She would grab it by the ears and just whip it around most days.

It's probably not a coincidence that when I ignored her one day she whipped it right past my head and onto my desk. I saw her staring right at me afterwards like "you gonna give that back?"
what a cute pup
So happy
This is amazing

Best dog I ever had would go to people he didn't like and fart in their faces - nasty, he was a Rottweiler I named Stinker for reasons! Our he'd go to the toilet, not his water bowl, get a drink them go to my ex-husband's best friend who he hated; he'd stand in front of Ted as he sat, act like he heard someone at the door then BARK - toilet water in the face!! 

How about the time our roommate hit him when he was about 8 months old. We heard screaming as Chris was getting ready for work; Stinker had shyt in his boots, both of them, without any in the floor!!!! What a mess on Chris' feet!
poot, right in the snoot
How do I save this
"i can throw my own ball!"
You need another dog so he can throw the ball while the other fetches.

Then you need to train the dog to train other dogs.
