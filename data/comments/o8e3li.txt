I want what they have
My cat loves to be held, and one day he was propped up against my computer monitor and lost his balance, falling backwards, and I caught him, which meant I was holding him, and he loved it. After that he started doing it on purpose - he'd stand up, look back at me and meow until I made eye contact, then fall backwards so I'd catch him.

Then it started escalating. First he stopped using the monitor and just started flinging himself into the air so he'd land on me and I'd catch him. Then he realized there were lots of places he could fling himself into the air onto me, so he'd climb someplace, meow at me to come over, and leap into my arms when I got there.

It kept escalating. He stopped waiting for me to acknowledge him before jumping, he'd just meow and leap. Then he stopped warning me at all that I was about to be cat bombed. Soon, every time I passed any surface above waist height, there was a high likelihood that there'd be a cat running over to bounce off it and onto me. Then he realized he didn't even need the raised surface, and he was jumping on me from the ground. Nowhere was safe from fly-by cattings. I caught him every single time.

It didn't stop there though. He stopped checking to make sure that I was looking and would sometimes land on my back, but I still caught him. It stopped mattering if my arms were clear, and I started dropping groceries to catch airborne cats. This is when I started failing to catch him sometimes - I couldn't get my arms clear fast enough, or I didn't hear him running up behind me to jump on my back, and I just couldn't move fast enough and he'd bounce off me and hit the floor.

Once he saw me move in one direction around the island counter in my kitchen and started running towards it, and didn't notice that I switched direction, and I watched as he just flew off the opposite end of the counter and as he sailed through the air with no way for me to get there in time to catch him he turned his head back towards me with a look of surprise and betrayal before he crashed to the ground.

It was a bit after that when I failed to catch the soaring cat one too many times that he just stopped. Abruptly, completely, and forever. He didn't go back to warning me, or be more careful to make sure it was actually possible for me to catch him, he just stopped altogether. It's been a few years now, and it's safer to walk around my house without the rain of cats, but I'll admit I'm a little hurt that he doesn't trust me to catch him any more.
That cat adores that man.
My one cat does something like this too… except I don’t always catch him, yet he still trusts me lol

My cat spent a good portion of her kitten hood cradled in my arm or tucked into a sling, so she’s like this with me. She’ll jump into my arms, flop, and almost immediately pass out. I’ve never had a cat trust me as much as she does, honestly.
Dad: I don't want a cat
Family: gets cat anyway
Dad and cat:
Why is the bookcase plasticked up?

Trust fall.

If you catch him its all cute and lovey. 

If you fail to catch him trust he will catch himself and it will be with his claws and trust it will hurt immensely.
this is totally my dad (who “hates cats”) with the cat he didn’t want 8 years ago
I really needed to see this today.
this is all I want in life
What a sweet little muffin 😍
My cat does this on the toilet. Ever since he was a kitten, he lays on my lap when I poop. He is 8 now, and quite a big boy, but I am a smaller women. Now when he flops, I have to catch him or he hits the floor. He has never once hit the floor. Even if it cost me a peaceful poop.
So cute!
Kitty love it’s hooman 💕💕💕
One of my cats does this, but he does it when I’m not expecting it and ends up just rolling down the couch or me like a furry bowling ball. It’s very funny.
I want this so bad
The way she looked at him 😊😊
Testing if human is well trained.
Catch me or I will claw the fuck out of your thighs as I stop myself falling further
My cat does this! We call it his rolly-pollies. He gets really excited when he sees us come home and he does forward rolls when running to say hi.

Who’s this guy? Dexter?
Cats are like people some are sweet little monsters and others are assholes with sweet moments
Is this man Dexter? Wtf
I don't know cat behavior, can someone explain what is really going on?
That is a 100% dedicated cat "owner". Props and respect.  
I wish you many many more years together!
My mom's cat does this. Sometimes I'm not ready and she just tumbles to the ground.
Is that Matt Thompson, co creator of "Frisky Dingo"?!
*Dad doesn't want a cat*

*Family gets cat anyway*

Dad and the cat:
dad: we don't need a cat

dad and the cat:
My previous cat would be on her perch (3 1/2 feet tall) and look at me a certain way to tell me she wants pets. When she was done with those she's give a slightly different look and stare at my eyes while purposely tipping over. I sometimes would have to scramble to catch her as I was moving away. Nobody believed me until they saw it! She was a character, I miss her.
Wow so much trust in that cat. Amazing.
so cute
He baby
Such a sweet cat.
This is so sweet! That cat loves and trusts him completely :)
My cat does this. He is a sweet boy.
Awe my kitty loves them trust falls too
I thought that was Alton Brown for a few seconds.
What a doll🥺
Find someone that will look at you the same way this man looks at the cat near the end.
My cat does this but she flops on me when I’m laying down 🥺💕

Dad: I don’t want a cat

Dad and the cat:
I don’t know much about cats but I’d imagine this is the dog equivalent of them sleeping on their backs.
That is one happy kitty
This is every person ever who said they hate cats a few months after.
the type of relationship i want
Gaaaawwww!
The technical term for that is "wumps"
My cat could never
We dont deserve cats change my mind
That's love right there.
That is sooo sweet. ❤️
This is what my homie Ramen does while I’m trying to work. All day, everyday.
That cat is way too cute
Damn... this is getting saved in my eyebleach folder
Shame he doesn’t trust the cat with his bookcase.
Let me guess: a dad who did not want a cat 👀
That kitty loves than man soooo much, I love how animals bond so closely to us humans.
I have that chair
10:1 dad didn't want the cat when they brought it home.
Now that's what you call cute!♥️
Dads and cats/pets always seem to get along despite the dads not wanting them in the first place. It's almost a given!
I just love everything about this! Such a trusting kitty and such a worthy human!
Such intelligent and social creatures! Both of them
Cute
I love them both.
I got a cat and it’s been like living with a person ever since I got him 3 years ago. Never wants to do anything with me but he always comes back to our house for food water and shelter.
Wuvs Dad
put this on r/mademesmile
Love cats
This is the best thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
My cat would take flying leaps, sometimes from across the room, and expect to be caught. There wasn't always warning that it was coming either, I've collected a few scars from the resulting scramble for grip.
What a distinguished gentleman
Cat
love the fact that the bookshelf is covered to probably protect it from the cat
Man trusts cat. Cat trusts man

That is perfection
My cat Nacho does this too. He just wants to be held like a wee babe
Why’s they’re shit wrapped up. Asking the real questions here
This is my cat Wally. He and I are basically one creature. 😋
When cats do that flop, you know they're lookin for a good pettin. Same with when they're rubbing their cheeks against the chair leg so hard the whole chair moves
Cute. 

So that is what my girl is doing. I just thought she didn't really understand gravity. lol
This is so sweet! What a loving kitty.
Not gonna lie. I find it cute and creepy at the same time. Added creep factor is the bookshelf in the background covered in plastic like what in the actual F? LOL.
My previous cat would do things like that. Didn't matter what you were doing at the time.

And you better catch her, or you'd end up with claws down your legs.
🥺🥺🥺
I have a duck who does this every time he wants scrubs. On top of the fridge, new Amazon boxes, the bed, under your feet in the middle of the night, right behind you when you’re cutting vegetables for dinner….. soooo cute…..
Bonding level 100
Dad: “No! No cats!”
That is so damn cute
Aww, what trust! That cat really believes in his/her human ....

My cat will lay on top of me while I’m in bed and she’ll shift onto her side, but she often will slip and if I don’t catch her she’ll fall off me. I always catch her, of course and when I do she rubs my chin with her head, which is her way of asking for kisses (which she loves). People always tell me that they’re not a fan of cats because they’re not super affectionate like dogs are, but mine is more affectionate than any dog I’ve ever seen.
Dad: we ain’t getting a cat.

Dad with cat:
Good ol cat Video
Good ol cat video
Hello
Awww cat
My cat does this.

It's great when I'm expecting it. When I'm not it's not so great, so when my cat is cuddling I'm always worried about catching him.

10/10 would recommend.
I used to not like cats very much always been a dog person but damn do these cute cat videos make me want to get a cat. Aside from the evil ones which even then still makes me consider one.
My cat does the same thing! He love, love, loves being held like a baby and walked around the house. He demands that I cradle him and trust falls into my arms. I've never let him down.
I love cats!!! 😊
What a beautiful relationship
I thought it said trust fails. Lol
It's the latest season of dexter
I had a cat once. He would not give a single fuck. I wish all cats seek for interaction and show that kind of appreciation towards humans.
He has never missed a catch. As soon as he does the cat will never do this again. People say elephants never forget but cats never forgive.
People with iron deficiency be like
fwump
My fella does something similar, except he teeters about on the edge of a table or bench and then just flops over for belly rubs knowing full well if I dont catch him hes falling straight off. Then I need to slide him into the middle or else Im left being structural support.
I like how he was trying to do some work at the beginning but quickly realized it was pointless and gave in to the cuddles.
This has filled me with joy.
This is why I like cats, they can be so vicious, but so wholesome!
What a silly kitty 😻
AWWWWW
Thank you for this. 
I am missing my fur babies right now and this made my day.
First time I’ve ever seen a cat purposefully land on its back
Was he planning for an explosive blood splatter?
Thought I was one of the only people that had a cat that does this (though mine doesn’t do it quite as extreme). Almost every night, my cat climbs on my chest when I’m laying on my back in bed watching tv. He loves to then just fall over to his right while facing me and land on his back between my arm and my torso I’m a kind of cradled pose. He then proceeeds to lay there until I just fall asleep before letting out a terrifying meow to let me know he wants to go out on the porch for the evening.
Cat trains human pet new trick
Nobody is talking about the Dexterish decor.
Didn’t need to use 1 of the 9 lives
Okay this is one of the sweetest fucking things I’ve ever seen 🥺
i want
That cat has trained it's human well, very impressive.
I need this in my life.
Dad: “no we’re not getting a cat, absolutely not”

**Dad and the cat the very next day**
My dog does something like this but she sits up and leans back expecting you to support her back otherwise she’d fall off the sofa.
I’ve had my cat for 14 years and she has never sat on my lap or cuddled up to me :(
My 30lb dog does this. She doesn’t always get caught, poor thing lol. She’s too big for these trust falls! 🤣
I want my little Fry to do that. He already has really good flops when I’m laying on the couch and he snugs right up on me.
Dad: doesn't want a cat

Also dad:
Great
Gaawwwwwwwwww...sooooooooo cat😬
My cat play attacks my legs when he doesn’t want me to walk away
So cute
Fvking cats
Cats are fucking awesome
Dog people will never understand
I audibly "awwwwed" when I saw this.
My kitty also used to do something similar to this until he did it a few times too many when we werent paying attention to him at all or in very weird position and he would fall off...lol. But it was very cute that he trusted us this much :) He still does, just not with catching him
In my situation its more like if you don't catch me, ima scratch the shit outa you.
I'll take 7, please .
Omg how SWEET!! 😍
What chair is he using? I likeee.
That is too cute :)
Omg, too cute!  My cat doesn't 'trust fall', but she hangs out with me all the time, she's a super snuggler.  For sleeping, we share a pillow.  Cats are next level. ❤ Thanks for posting this gem.
This is fucking ABSURDLY adorable.
See!??  Cats don’t always land on their feet!
That’s a good kitty.
I bet this dad was very opposed to getting this cat at first
Omg how precious
That's so absolutely and utterly adorable.
That's his baby...
Thats so precious
Oh my god, he is an awesome human!
what is this thing in me that brings calm whenever I see animals being animals?
One cat slept in my lap 6 hours a day.  I have one under my arm right now.  She will fall asleep upside down soon. Another cuddles on my shoulder.

I hate it. Lol
With all that plastic on the wall, I would think you  invited Paul Allen
My cat does this to my BF all the time lol. Altho it's a more gentle fall
Dear satan

This is almost sickeningly sweet 😖😖😖
I don't think I've ever seen a cat purposely land on it's back.
One of my cats does this all the time! 🧡🧡🧡
Why are cats so freaking adorable
MAN I LOVE CATS!
Why do all these cats look like my grandmas
Too cute! I miss my cats 🐈😧
My dog does this, but jumping on ppls laps. Sometimes, she jumps just as someone sits down and misses clawing your knees.
Dads and the cat they “didn’t want”
I have always wanted a cat that was this affectionate. Every cat I get seems to hate being held. I've also always wanted a cat that I could pat my chest and it runs and jumps in my arms. Maybe one day....
Aww how cute!  Evie would love that kitty 😻
You are blessed and obviously worthy of this trust
I love the cat 🐱
I have a cat that does this; we call it the "flop". He'll flop anywhere on or near us, expecting us to catch him. I'm surprised he hasn't flopped right over the side of the bed yet.

It's *extremely* cute.
Omg that’s cute.
There is still decency in the world it seems
"Catch me like one of your French girls"
Dad: doesnt want cat
family: gets cat anyway
dad:
Those aren't trust falls, those are trust flops
My wife had a cat that would more or less do this. He would cuddle in my arms when she wasn't around, but as soon as she showed up he would push off of me with zero effort towards self-preservation. He would just push away from me with his front paws until he was parallel with the ground, then his back paws to push away from me and I would balance him on whichever arm was convenient (usually my right arm) stoop down and sort of roll him sideways onto his feet.
Is he protecting his books from covid?
This is the cutest thing
P.S.A! That’s a Uno by Steelcase chair. It’s a boardroom chair not meant for prolonged seating time. Even thought they’re comfortable as shit to sit in!
Cat has got some serious trust issues 😅
My 19 year old calico cat passed away 2 days ago and this made me cry. I miss my girl so much 😭
Sweetheart ☺️
Dad and the cat he didn't want:
“We’re not getting a cat”
And they say cats aren’t affectionate
Lucky man. I wish one of my cats was that snuggly. As i write this i have my feral inside (!?!) he’s my little spoon right now.
I’m obsessed.
i wish i had a cat
100,000th upvote

super cute cat, must be a great owner.
Watch how I have trained my human to catch me.  Isn't he amazing?
Man's sprayed a little H2O9 on himself.
So much trust there!
How precious
Super cute
My cat sometimes does this. It started with her rubbing on me one day but her slipping and me catching her before she fell. She checks for my arms to be out though since one time I didn't notice she was about to flop and she crashed into my lap instead.
One of my cats does this too, she begin with tilting her head, then smile with her eyes and then slowly slide her body into cradle position
🥺
[removed]
Haha I’ve never seen a friendly cat like that
