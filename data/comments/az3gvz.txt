Give Sadie a hug for me! 
I just want to wrap my arms around her 
What a beauty 💕

r/oldmandog would love to see that face!
When I see this picture I imagine the dog saying some wise Confucius quote
My God what a good doggo

Sadie has such a sweet smile! You're a lucky human.
Does she happen to be friends with a chap named Arthur?

What a sweet face 😭💕
I want to pet her! :(
Well isn’t she Hapie?
My friend's dad smiles like that!!!! He is the kindest man!!!♥️♥️
The embodiment of “UwU”
My cat, also named Sadie, approves. 
That's an exceptionally adorable corgi you've got there. ❤
Sadie!  She looks so happy. I am too obsessed with dogs. Too. Too. Too. I'd love a Corgi, but my dream dog is the Bernese Mountain Dog
Give pets to sadie and tell her I love her. 
Looking so comfy on her bed of Hawaiian rolls
Hi Sadie! What a pretty smile!
That Smile though

Me when I don't have my glasses 
Aww!  I had a Corgi mix named Sadie who smiled the same way.  Such good pups!
You should cross post to /r/corgi
Recently discovered r/oldmandog. She’d fit perfectly here. 
Smiling dogs make my heart happy!  Thank you, sweet sadie💕
r/OldManDog
Such a sweet girl. 

I bet she can hold her own against those damn O'Driscolls.
Thanks, I kinda needed that today.
It looks like she's about to sneeze
I love you Sadie!! 💖
Yeah boi
If she was s person she'd be a kindly old grandmother who loves to bake, has loads of birdhouses in her yard, and tells really raunchy jokes when you least suspect it.
I wish my 15 year old sadie could smile, but she's so old that she can barely stand now, cute dog though!
Aw she looks delightful!
Cheddar?
I swear that doggo just told a dad joke
....*lemme see the butt*
I wanna hug Sadie and squish her happy face. 
Bb 🥰
I luv
Buddha
r/SpaceWolves will like him.
What a good girl!!
Wow, 15 is old for a corgi. Mine growing up only lasted 10 years. 😔 
wow!
What a sweet old girl. 
This made my morning 
Awwww
Recently lost my dog due to illness and this cheered me up a bit, give em a hug for me! 
What a happy Corgo
I love this smile... It feels like he saw me somewhere 😂💜
She looks like a corgi grandma <3
Best girl. 
It's my goal to help our corgi live that long. 
Qt
Wow 15 yr. I wish my dog would have been able to get this old. She get only 10yr 
If I had the space and the money I definitely would get a corgi. They are so cute.
Ohhhh corgibuttttttt
Ohhhh corgibuttttttt
Oh, god.  I want her.  😍
my family had a dog named Sadie that looked similar to this. she was the sweetest thing
Good girl 
Corgi's have the cutest smiles. 
Enjoying life
If Corgo is happy, then I am happy.
Corgi/shepherd cross? She's beautiful!
does she ask you to help her with a bounty? 
Wish their average life span is a lot longer.
So cute <3
We all need more of this content in our lives

Thank you.
She’s like pudding I love her
Absolute Chubster
that’s my dogs name :)
She's beautiful! Give her a snuggle from me!
Beautiful! We have an 11 year old corgi that started having the usual corgi problems last year causing him to lose the use of his back legs. I couldn't be more proud of how well he adjusted to using his wheelchair. There are little scuffs allover the house and he won't hesitate to run over your feet but of course totally worth it ha. He's still as happy and as derpy as ever. 
She has the energy of an old woman in *Redwall*. She is a wise corg.
Sadie is very happie.
Thanks i love her
Always upvote good doggos 😁
Good picture 
Sadie was the name of my first pupper. God i miss her. 
Doesn't look very sad to me. 12/10 wrong name.
Aw, seeing Sadie’s sweet face just inspired me to get off my butt & go hug my 11yr old corgi. Give that sweet loaf all the pets & hugs & snacks!
Sadie Adler? Is this what you look like after 100 years?
She is corgeous 
Pet her for me please 😭💕
Cuteness overload 
Thank you Sadie, you sweetie pie! Smiling right back at you, beautiful!
Corgis really are the best breed of dog there is
Love it
I just wanna snuggle that pup so badly
Old doggie!

That’s the cutest small old doggie ever!
She has the "you like krabby patties don't you squidward?" 
Corgi's just seem like amazing pets. They make me smile whenever I see them.
So cute.

Would definitely dog nap for a few hours and return her of course.
She's Corgeous!
That smile tho
That's a face that just screams "Where's my prune juice, Margaret?"
Granma corgi
I misread your title, but I now want a pet that I can call “the real slim Sadie”
Sadie? Doesnt look very sad
She looks like that adorable old grandmother who sits in her chair and doesnt fully understand what's going on around her, but is just happy to see the family she loves having fun. 
She lives in Northern California right??
wow old age for a corgi. very cute
Bah gawd. What an addddorable doggi!
It's so contagious 😁
Ol’ Sadie Adler
I use to know girl named Sadie, use to be my home boys lady ...
Sadie looks stoned. 😎

This makes me happy
I bet cutest little sploot is happening 😍
What a top bitch!
Thats one happy dog.
Looks like Sadie aged quite well
Haski no ??
Haski no ??
Haski no ??
When you look at the history of dogs you see that they were wild wolves tamed into becoming human companions. With all these new trends of having lions and tigers as pets will these big cats be home pets in the future?

Sorry for the bad english
She deserves an eternity of ear rubs
Satisfied Sadie can take the place of Satisfied Seal
Idek Sadie but I love her so much.omggggg she’s so cute 
Doesn't looks SADie to me :D
Thank you for this 💖
Soo nice 🐶❤🤗
Adorable
And that's my new wallpaper. Really adorable, thank you! 
My Shadow was 17. Miss that guy so much.
We must protect her at all costs
The next time I'm in a position to adopt, I'm going for a Corgi, Wheaton, or Pitbull. Truthfully, I want them all! But those Corgi butts just entertain me to no end.
My sister made the same face when I showed her the picture 
this made me smile back instantly
I’ve never seen a dog smile like George W Bush. This is gold
Lies, this isn’t some common bitch... it’s cheddar!

Sweet baby :) dawh❤️

the happiest pupper I've seen all week :) 
Is this dog alive?
This is adorable but at the same time weird that this was the first thing in my feed. My girlfriend is named Sadie and she and I are both 15 years old so thanks FBI agent in my phone for the cute corgi photo.
Omg cute!

Sadie!  Sweetie pie!!
Dreaming of Chocolate !
That is, in fact, a smile.
/u/title2imagebot
OMG She's adorable. I have a corgi named Sadie too!
I would die for sadie
She looks like a sweet old Asian lady selling steamed buns in a small Chinese shop 
You’ve had a corgi since before they became the new fashion accessory! 
That is a pupper who clearly enjoys life.
I love Sadie!!
Is she happy because she just killed some goddamn O'Driscolls?
OH MY GOSH I LOVE HER!!
The purest wholesome smile of the world 😍😍😍
Noooooo! I'm destroyed by cuteness!!! 😍💀
Such a sweet doggo smile 
Dawg
She smiles just like old people do
She's so adorable!!! She's got that cute old lady smile. Omg please spoil her and give her all the love you can 
Cowboy Bebop made me want a corgi

Maybe its the fact my own dog is getting on, but I kinda aww harder at senior dogs:)
My Corgi lived to be 17, but she didn't smile like this.  I have a great dog now but I do miss my Corgi and my other childhood dog.
So cute!!
What a sweet old girl
i hope my Stanley lives as long as she does! he's only 2 right now but man, corgis are the coolest. 
Your dog just made the day of thousands of people around the world 10x better by just smiling.  
Thank you OP for sharing with us, you are a lucky person by having Sadie by your side!
Sadie, God Bless You with a big, beautiful smile.  Thank you so much for not wasting it, you good girl.  Cheers!
I can't wait to tell Sadie she is famous next time I see her. 
Aw that just made my day better!
I hope tofu makes it that long. She’s literally my family.
Doggo go Happ
Sadie is the only right name for a corgi 😊
He looks full of wisdom
Love this do much!
Smmmmmmuile
*boop*
My old German Shepherd had that same look, but it was because he was in pain. As adorable as she looks, she could be in pain as well 
Happe dogger
Awwwww too cute xD
Sadie looks like a Hapie
You’re paying for all of it
Ted Cruz?
I want a hug from that doggo I hope she has an amazing day she’s adorable 😊❤️💕
Sadie looks more like a Happie
I'll have what she's having.

Looks so happy! 
This is the sweet old grandma of dogs. ❤️
Thank you Sadie, this made my day. also, not to be dramatic but tell her I would die for her 
A really good old gal!
Ummm, all i see is a corgi.
So beautiful 🥰🥰🥰
What a sweet sweet baby. 
Hi Sadie 🥰
Sadie, you are a Sweetheart ❤️😇
Precious.
Sadie? She looks pretty happie to me.
Hello Sadie. Thanks for brightening my day!
Must give pats! 
Why are dogs so cute?
I would die for Sadie the 15 year old corgi
waaw so cuuuteee
SO cuuuute!!! 🤗💗💖💗
I want to give her all the hugs and belly rubs!
So happy. 💛
15! What a good fur face!
Beautiful. To this day, I'll never find a better girl than my Ginger who died of cancer in 2013 after 13 amazing years. Corgis are the best. 
sadie looks happie
I had a black lab named Sadie. She wasn’t the sweetest dog I’ve ever met. She died from cancer 4 years ago at 9 years old, her brother from the same litter is still with us though.
LOOK AT ALL THE FLUFFS!! Ahhhh
Accidentally fat finger down voted this (fixed it after) and immediately felt SO bad 
Cute pupper for sure, but people need to stop thinking dogs can "smile." Dogs can't smile.

Commence the downvoting.
Oh what a sweetheart!
She's just adorable. Boop, Sadie.
She’s a pretty girl 
Live it!
Not so Sadie 
She looks like a kindly grandmother. Makes me miss my corgi.
Happy old girl :)
That eye smile tho. 
Sadie is the best!
Sadie looks like a sweet grandma who insists you take at least 3 cookies home with you because you're looking thin.
really
Our 16 yo corgi died last summer :(
What a cutie
Sadie sure is a beauty!!  Give her a big hug and belly rub!!
Looks rather happy than sadie.
i love u sadie
Fuck Micah!
That's a cute blop
I would murder a whole nation for you Sadie
Looks more like she is mid-laugh.
Toss that one on Reddit gets drawn 
Sadie? More like Happie amiright fellas?
15yrs adorable.
Sadie the chonker!
Awwwwwwwwh. She's adorable 💚💚💚 how old is pupper?
r/rarepuppers
Mrs. Adler?
Sadie-baby
Oh my God I literally have a fucking midterm tomorrow and I just spent five minutes crying.

Putting down old friends is the worst.
Aww
I give her my uwus 
You sure it's name in Happie
She looks so sweet! Hope she lives further, I really do! How's is she at this age, still active?
Cute
Poor Sadie most likely can’t get up or down on her own without pain because Corgis are bred to have back problems.
Dogs don't smile 
RIP
She looks high af
#BOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOPBOOP

That's one for every single year she's been a very good girle.
Omg what a sweet doggo. I would wear her cute little picture on a shirt!
Awww! Such a good girl!! Scritches from afar! :) 
Much floofo good hap girl ! Load with kisses 😍
Now I start to worry that people on reddit actually believes dog can smile 
Why are you calling her "Sadie" she looks "Hapie" to me.
Looks stressful to me
That’s not Cheddar. That’s just some
Basic bitch
