Getting ready for a night at the Roxbury it looks like
[Pomeranians love haircuts!](http://i.imgur.com/d30CJ1m.gifv)
Needs audio with a good song to go with it


"what is looove, baby don't hurt me"
Wiggle wiggle*
 
>Who's a sexy beast? 

I'm a sexy beast! 
>Who's a sexy beast?

 I'm a sexy beast! 



Just keep cutting, just keep cutting 
THIS THE BEST THING IVE EVER SEEN
Knowing reddit i'm about to read the comments and find out why this is the result of some horrible disease or birth defect.
Reminds me of this [masterpiece](https://i.imgur.com/6ZUZIOT.gifv)
And when I move just a bit, my barber yells at me :(.
Don't ANY of you ruin the magic of this for me.
Needs more Haddaway 
Papas got a new pair of poofs
Look closer, She has her thumb and finger holding the back of the neck, making the dog move like that. Dancing dog? more like forced dancing 
Don't Poms have a double coat and therefore should not get cut that short?
‚Äú*sings inside head* I‚Äôm so cute, I‚Äôm so cute, I‚Äôm a goodboye and I‚Äôm so cute‚Äù
If you or anyone you know is having a rough day, watch this. It's impossible to not smile watching that lil guy shake with glee
[I'm too sexy for this haircut!](https://gifnote.com/play/325578022377752181)
<hums> imma gonna look freaking gorgeous...
You can see the stylists forearm moving with the dancing. The dog isn't dancing, the stylist is just wiggling the dog while she records. Cute but misleading
Why does he look like he should be in Night At The Roxbury? 
Surely that can't be a dog, it's one of those small dancing Christmas reindeer without the antlers
That's adorable!!!
Aren't they just moving the dog with their index finger and thumb?
üéºüé∂üé∂What is Love? Baby dont hurt me...üé∂üé∂üéº
[I love to singa](https://youtu.be/zj1FifK3bbg) 
Is this your pupper? I put the Roxbury beat to it.
https://youtu.be/NiWqForR4zE


She's moving it..
OMG it's so cute I'm going to die. üíÄ
My dog fights me when I try to brush his fur in the slightest. One day, I arrived earlier to pick him up from the groomer and peeked in and he was standing on the table, handing her his paw. He is like the best behaved little man in the world for them!
I haven't ever commented on this subreddit but this is absolutely fucking adorable.
this is the dance i do when I am eating 
Now who's going to be the kill joy and tell us this is because of some horrific brain disease caused by inbreeding
Nobody sees that the dog doesn't wink his tail. He is not really happy about his (forced) dancing I guest
I was feeling a little down tonight, then I saw this. Now I can't stop smiling. Thank you OP. Thank you little cute puppy dog. 
Fabulous!
Shake your tailfeather... yea yea... Shake your tailfeather
Quite the dancer there! Could fit with any song. 
This one simple trick that hairdressers hate!
"What is love"
This Looks fake to me
What a great jiggle 
This is the best thing. Can I get a dog like this? 
*Death By Glamor plays in the background*
looks like its about to get his head chopped off lol
Thank you reddit for providing the collective therapy dog that we all need right now.
This keeps showing on my feed and I keep giggling like an idiot.
You can‚Äôt fool me I know you glued him to the floor!
WHAT IS LOVE. BABY DONT HURT ME. DONT HURT ME. NO MORE.
This is the best thing I've seen on internet today. He is the cutest fluff. :)
Sorry, my wagger thing is broken right now

WHAT IS LOVE ?!
/u/prinholly7709 
I think her thumb might have something to do with it...
This is the greatest thing I have ever seen. Shut it down boys, its over.
Love it!!
Was listening Alestorm - Drink and doggo danced too good with this song. 
There is no way this is a real dog. He has too much sauce.
OMG this dog is so cute 
What is love
A little late, but this doggo wants to take you all to a gay bar. [https://gifsound.com/?gifv=qPvlc91&v=IslF\_EyhMzg&s=18](https://gifsound.com/?gifv=qPvlc91&v=IslF_EyhMzg&s=18)
The sync of this dog with Space Jam blows my mind.

https://gifsound.com/?gifv=qPvlc91&v=J9FImc2LOr8&s=16

"To the jam, all in ya face!"
What is love?
100% the barber is moving the dog...but still super cute
legends say that the tail is the actual dog, and it's wagging it's body.
This is one of the first posts I saw browsing reddit with my morning coffee, and honestly I don't think there's anything else the internet can show me today that will top this. This is outrageously cute.
What is love?! Baby don't hurt me! Don't hurt me! No more!

Ah ah ah ah staying alive, staying alive 
Dude, it lines up to rap god
Man, I needed that today. Thank you. 
My little black pomeranian loooooves going to the groomer. You can tell he loves feeling handsome. He totally struts his stuff after. And when getting blow dried he'll turn his head where you can get to certain spots better. Oh and don't get me started on how much he loves bows. She(our amazing groomer) hand makes them... the second the ribbons come out here gets SO excited. Even if I just say her name he perks up and gets excited. I know it's a mix of how much he just loves her as a person and the fact she makes him look fab. Lol. 
He's always been my little diva queen and I love it lol. I rarely dress him up cuz I'm sure he's already very hot with all his fluff,  but he has this one pirate costume that loves to wear around. He like lifts his legs up so I can put it on. Lol. 

Poor boy though... recently diagnosed with diabetes and since he started insulin he lost a bunch of weight, and now he's losing a bunch of fur.. and his eye sight is almost completely gone due to cataracts and surgery is just too expensive. :( makes me feel like a bad mommy. 


I can tell he's more depressed about his fur though :/. He's not even 8 yet either. It Breaks my üíî heart. I love my little bear cub. üë∏‚ù§üíìüíïüíñüíóüíúüß°üíöüíôüíûüíü‚ù£
Maybe it's just me but the way this dog moves really reminds me of Samuel L Jackson. Is that weird? It's probably weird
UNCE UNCE UNCE UNCE
Well, he's tolerating it.  She's dancing him around with her finger in his collar.
This is the single most cute thing I've seen in my life
Cutest thing I've seen all day :)
What is love...
No one will see this, but I love this so much
I do that same little dance as I eat pizza 
That zoom in made my heart smileüò≠üíñ
I have never seen a dog move like this. This is fucking adorable.
Why does this freak me out 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZY4ovo5hjM
Why he do dance
I feel so happy inside
Man those comb scissor this are what my beard trimming has been missing.
I just came back to this and I know you've had a zillion comments, but I've now bookmarked it because it literally makes me cry from how happy it makes me feel and how cute he/she is. THE RHYTHMIC DANCING. I CAN'T.
[deleted]
Unzunzunzunzunz!
It's amazing how something as simple as this can make your who fucking week.
wOmAN FORCes DoG tO daNcE WhIle BEIng SLaShEd To PIeCEs
Awesome how he dances the whole time. 
Saturday Night Live at the Roxbury 
Sorry to ruin everyone‚Äôs fun, but the groomer‚Äôs index fingerand thumb are not visible..  the dancing is a lie.

The fun is real.
Forcing his haircut with my thumbs is more appropriate title.
She's just pushing the dogs neck with her thumb :/
Little Monkey dog has some rhythm. 
Sassy
I wanna see how this dog walk 
That dog has better moves than me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRVfysTXhNA
Fabulous!
YAS this is amazing
i bet hes a big fan of night at the roxbury
Amazon link? Does it take AA or AAA batteries?
This is the only valid argument for buying a pomeranian.
[removed]
Bullshit animal abuse, the finger pinching behind is neck making it shake like that, ur pathetic. Try doing that without touching the dog then ill believe u
The lady is using her thumb and forefinger to jerk the dogs head around.
Fake and gay. Cutters hand is moving the pup
# SPOILER: GROOMER IS MOVING DOG WITH THUMB & INDEX FINGER.
I hope the lady isn't controlling the pom with her thumb and index, that would make this less awesome.
This would be good for CPR class. Perform CPR to the beat of this doggo. 
Little doggo has got the groove
This definitely has potential for r/perfectloops 
**I like to move it move it**
Reminds me of those toy dogs that you could turn on and walk and bark around the house!
I CAN MAKE YOUR DOG CLAP.  CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP
Y he wigle 
Somebody's gonna get cut... 
Watching cute stuff before work makes my night better.... i fucking like that shit 
That dog is listening to some T-Swift. You can't tell me otherwise. 
That dog has more rhythm than me.

" I LIKE TO MOVE IT MOVE IT, I LIKE TO, MOVE IT!
I was listening to music while looking through reddit like I usually do and the music matched perfectly with this. It was beautiful
NOOOOOO!!!!  AHHHHH111  IT'S TOO CUTE!
ü§óüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Are you serious ?! 
I don't know what this dog has exactly, but he's got more of it than I ever will.
Wow. I know not everyone knows this song, but it syncs up better than most of the songs on here

https://gifsound.com/?gifv=qPvlc91&v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
I don't know who is having more fun, the dog, the hairdresser or me :D

This has got me trippin'. This dog is grooving.
This guy was totally dancing to daft punk‚Äî https://gifsound.com/?gifv=qPvlc91&v=a5uQMwRMHcs&s=213
I‚Äôm on my phone scrolling through reddit while listening to music on another device. I can‚Äôt even explain how confused I was when it seemed like this lil guy was dancing to the beat of my music...
This is probably the cutest ting I've seen in my entire life.
Doing his little happy dance.
wtf
Me when i'm eating delicious food 
What is love...
is that a puppy or an adult dog?  What kind of puppers?
Your hand loves him getting his haircut
haters gonna hate
I think this is the happiest boy I've ever seen. üñ§
That sudden change in focus when it zoomed in looked like a spongebob close-up
How is this even real!
You have got to be kidding me.
Doing a little dance while he gets his haircut awww
That right there is a dog that you could name Roxbury and not sound pretentious.
Oh. My. God. I feel like i need to punch a dolphin after gushing over this little dancing munchkin.
This is the exact same dance I do when I eat something yummy.
This looks like a *Rhythm Heaven* game.
I'm listening to Milkshake by Kelis as I watch this and it's perfect
I thought the dog‚Äôs name was Loves and I thought to myself that‚Äôs a weird name for a dog. 
wow that little poochie has some groove
quick, someone post the gif of the head dance from "dance night at the roxbury"
What is love???
This is perfect.
Is that James Brown the dog?
Did you train your dog to do that?
Wow my heart melted...  I needed this. The wiggle the cuteness. 
Awwwww
Lol wish my barber made me get this happy over haircuts 
"ye. ye. ye. ye. gettin. my. hair. cut!"
For couple seconds it went well with Rammstein's Heirate Much.
That zoom on the end made me think of my friends filming me while getting a haircut all while laughing at me. It was super awkward, for the barber.
OwNer FoRcEs DoGGo To DaNCe Or GeTs FuCkinG dEaD 
Too cute.
Cute af
This is what I was listening to when I watched this. 

[Martha Moxly](https://youtu.be/mDbJAAaPwF8)

Idk if it fit but I laughed and got the cutes from it, so it did the job. 
r/eyebleach
What kind of dog is this? 
That dog is so precious 
New Japanese dog toy out now! 
It‚Äôs like donkey from Shrek humming
Doobtie doobtie doobtie doo
I feel like if anything is r/WiggleButts, this sure is  
Hahahaha this is fantastic. 
/r/eyebleach
Someone has to put Take on me as background music.
A trim or shave, I make no troubles
Make me pretty, for the cuddles
I‚Äôm tuff and brave, I make no puddles
Forgot my wallet.. can I pay in snuggles?
Reminds me of Terry Crews
This is the happiest dog getting a haircut.. ever!
OMG! CUTIIIIEE üòç
Gah! Ahhh haha ugh wha what is that?? CUTE.
Shake your tailfeather... yea yea... Shake your tailfeather
It‚Äôs dancing xD 
Oh em gee he loves it
Looks like a grooming scene from A Night at the Barxbury.
I haven't laughed so hard at anything over the past week. I needed that.
What a cutie 
Lil dork.
Snip snip snip snip, I could hear the entire thing
I like to move it move it 
It‚Äôs like he went to a cuteness seminar 
Dance boye
/u/bloodboy12
Notice that the person's thumb and forefinger are not visible.  He is moving the dogs head.
I can barely handle how cute this is.  thank you
Is it just me or does that dog look like and moves one of those kids toys?
That might be one the the cutest things I've seen in a while 
This is now one of my favourite things ever. Thank you. Where do I get one? 
Robot dogo
I wish I could upvote this 10 times
I now have a reason to live
chippy chops
omfg lol
Goddamn be careful you don‚Äôt cut that dog‚Äôs fucking jugular man shit
Shut down the internet 
seems you have all lost 
I wonder what song he's singing in his head. 
When your grooving to a song you wish the world could hear. 
Welp, I‚Äôm not gonna do anything else today. I am just going to sit and watch this most adorable clip, over and over and over. 
I wonder if it's tickling him that's why he's wiggling like that?
Hopefully they haven‚Äôt cut into the inner layer of fur, or it won‚Äôt grow back, but this looks incredibly short to me. So many Pomeranians given these ‚Äúteddy bear‚Äù cuts end up with permanent damage to their fur. The double layer also acts as insulation from both the cold and the heat. People need to stop choosing ‚Äòfashionable‚Äô or ‚Äòlow maintenance‚Äô looks over what is naturally best for their dog.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etEQz7NYSLg
Too cute!

This went along perfectly to the song I was listening to. 
Where can I get 30 of these dogs

*intense zoom-in*
Pupper has some spunk!
Can easily see this as a Disney character ala King Julio
I'm cry laughing so hard. As I own a pom also and just thinking this is him made it infinitely more funny!
Found this while listening to the Space Jam theme... beautiful.
Groomer had his/her thumb pinned and pulling on the dogs collar from the back and making the dog do that weird jiggle. 
I have two pomeranians.  Best dogs ever!
Freaking adorable
OH MY GOD!
Somebody knows he's the cutiest cutie pie!
:)
he is so on the beat!! lol
That‚Äôs not a real dog that‚Äôs a little dancing toy dog 
I immediately started hearing "Well you can tell by the way I use my walk..."
trust meÔºåMads langer-3AM is the perfect song to fit this gif
My heart üòç
Love this 
Sooooo cute!
I am screaming!
Cute, but it is obviously the thumb and pointer finger around the neck of the dog shaking it back and forth.
I just can't stop watching and humming with this little cutie. Omg move videos please!!!
If this had sound, I‚Äôd go with a nice ABBA track for this dog.

I wish I could dance half this well. 
Baby don‚Äôt hurt me 
Dancing dog!

Dont know why but reminds me of james brown
Pomeranian maniac that's for sure!

And he's dancing while the groomer cuts his fur.
Zit je haircut?
I needed this thanks
My brother has one of them doggos. They are much smarter than they look.

OBSESSED
Ugh ugh ugh ugh...ugh ughughugh...ugh ugh ugh....

The guy or girl is moving the dog with their thumb and pointer finger.
Dancin syncs up with Migos üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I no longer have to wonder what James Brown was reincarnated as.
That dog has rhythm for real 
This reminds me of the gif with the asian guys in suits

That dog definitely has some black in him.
At a barbershop and they're playing Michael Jackson "Let's dance, let's shout" (no idea if that's really the name of the song) and I see this cuteness and it fits so well.
Impressive scissors job. I should have my hair cut by her. 
Jenny Slate?
What does this kind of scissors do?
Let me guess, the dogs listning to the duck song?
üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ
He's so fluffy im gonna diiiiieeeeeüòÄüò¢
I REALLY REALLY WANT TO ENJOY MY LIFE LIKE THAT PUPPER ENJOYS THE HAIRCUT.
So cute, he's like one of those dancing flowers.
Oh my god!!!!
Where can I get a good boi like this
That's the person's hand moving the dog... you can see their hand's hovering, and the forearm muscles moving. 
reminds me of gizmo
Can‚Äôt stop crying while laughing.
His wiggles just kills me. 
r/awwtf
Twisting to the beat!
Don't hurt me...no more
While this may be fake, this dog is pretty well behaved and tolerant of whats happening.
Zoom in on cold dead eyes ruined it :(
This is me finding an awesome skirt at a thrift store.
I wasn't ready for that close up
Using her finger and thumb to make its head do that. Yawn
I wonder how many people other than me read the title, and initially thought the dog was called "Loves"
hahha
Thats so cute omg
OH MY GOD
Was listening to Drake‚Äôs new song Nonstop and the gif was going to the beat of the song lmao
Source: @3puppy - Instagram.
He's so FANCY!
Love this new colour way 
The groomer is just moving the dog's head back and forth with their thumb in the collar. But okay.
like a Dominican barber shop
This was literally too much for me. 
How is it possible for anything to compete with this level of cuteness?
Was listening to Good Day Sunshine as I opened this, and it synced so perfectly I honestly thought it was a part of the gif
This video was made to have Vitas music playing with it 
Walk it like I talk it!
 Ok
"It's just so fluffy!!!"
I am confusion. It looks like she is completely manipulating the bogs movements with her left hand. I‚Äôm pretty sure this cute pup is not dancing. I kinda feel bed for the little guy cause on top of everything else, he‚Äôs getting a bad haircut. 
I wonder what part the two unseen fingers behind the dogs neck area have to play in this? I thought it seemed to rythmic, almost anticipatory.  
GOD DAMMIT NOW IM HAVING A WONDERFUL DAY 
The angle of that scissors makes me very nervous.
This made me smile. 
This is just a rhythm heaven minigame.
He is really feelin himself!
Looks like a baby gorilla or something...
playing ski mask the slump god, catch me outside over this makes it 100 times better lmfao

This is my favorite gif ever. You shake it doggy! You shake it :D

This needs some music.
This is begging to be set to an appropriate beat.
Something tells me the stylist is using her thumb and forefinger to kinda wiggle the dog around. Thoughts??

This just turned around my whole day :)
This video makes me happy, I needed this today
Put some music behind it and you got a dancing pom pom.
Fuck, that dog has better dance moves than I do

Best quality: his wiggles
I find this mesmerizing somehow.
They're moving the dogs head with their think and index finger
Boomerang app, no?
My Pom only acts like that when he wants a booty rub (right above the tail on the back. Swinging the booty back and forth when rubbing his back on a foot or hand). 
That's so damn cute
Reminds me of the song I Whip My Hair Back and Forth
It is so sweet
What kind of scissors are those?
He‚Äôs dancing in time to the music I‚Äôm playing.  
Omg the ferbies are alive!!! 
It's the groomers thumb and index finger doing this, I wish it wasn't though.
This also came up in /r/funny and on my main page as one beneath the other
This is the highlight of my day. 
Im currently listening to message in a bottle and this works perfect. 
Get back
This is too much 
OMGGG
Omg he‚Äôs dancing. 
Work it bitch!
(Assuming the dogs gender is female)
Late comment, I know, but I just wanted to inform everyone that this dog is dancing in perfect sync to the Office theme song. 
I cant do it...that wiggle is just too much dammit.
Pup has been watching too much A Night at the Roxbury
They call him Cuban Pete
He's the king of the rumba beat
When he plays the maracas he goes
Chick-chicky-boom
Chick-chicky-boom
Omg I can‚Äôt believe this is a real dog. It‚Äôs so cute!!!
[This where the party at? ](https://youtu.be/wWNKFpch8v0)
I Iove it! I‚Äôve never seen anything like that! So cute!
Gettin jiggy wit it ;)
Im listening Nugget by Cake and this doggos dance lined up almost scarily with the song. Sharp looking haircut, pup!
Cute :)
I feel like this needs 'Stayin alive' playing in the background
This needs music!
All I can hear in my head is the intro to blue Monday by new order... Pups got that beat down!
Fast scissor hands 
I'll take 5 to go please.

Happy Dance! 
Amazing video
This made my day 
That is one groovin' little man.
This needs music!
I'm listening to Aerosmith's last child and I stumble on this little fucker dancing to the beat perfectly and I nearly pissed myself!
I'm a 30 year old man and that is cute.
I just showed this to everyone in my office! Walked around to everyone‚Äôs cubicle and shoved my phone in their face! 
I think I can watch this for an hour.
Aww, it looks like one of those battery-run toys
I need some tunes to go along with this masterful dancing clippage.
Thoughts this was a boomerang video at first. Too cute!
What is love...baby don‚Äôt hurt me..
There is definitely music to go with this clip and I really need to see it.
You fucked up my game with the notification, I‚Äôll allow it.
That is so sweet it‚Äôs gonna give me the diabeetus.
OP is just moving the dogs head with her thumb and index finger, the dog isn't doing that on its own
If only my dog could do that when she gets her haircut üò©üò≠
Good God almighty
