I wonder how many nasa shirts he has
[deleted]
Dog got older, dude got younger.
He is way too small in the first picture, needs a children seat lol
Wow the driver didnt age a single day.
Love the way the dog was gonna grab the handle 'cause the car was too fast for him
I bet he ate the armrest.
That’s one hell of a road trip!

Some say they’re still driving to this day.
ITT a bunch of people that don’t know the difference between girl and boy dogs
Months have passed but it’s still raining. Are you in the UK? lol
Credit to this guy for finding a hairstyle and sticking to it
This reminds me of my dog that past away a couple years ago.. Had him for 17 years 😔 god they are the best at being best friends eh
Did your passenger eat the middle compartment?
Cute and all but I’m pretty sure this isn’t good for 4 legged animals. Their spines aren’t built the same way ours are and this can cause pain and damage.
Seatbelts and airbags are not designed to protect anything other than humans. 

Do not use seatbelts on your dogs, they have properly designed doggy seatbelts.

For argument's sake let's say you DGAF about your dog, you should still put them on a proper dog seatbelt. If not properly belted the dog can become a projectile during a crash and severely hurt a person.

But since you DO give a fuck about your dog and yourself, you'll belt your dog in your car from now on.
Adorable, but I have to wonder if she is the reason there is no center console in the latter pic. I left a pup in the car while I cleaned a fish at a buddy's house for about 20-30min,15 feet away from the car. During that time she quietly ate the hand brake, seatbelts door cards, steering wheel and headrests. It was also my sister's car, so I actually had to fix all that shit.
That dog is being, um... upsettingly immodest.
I love raw stripped inside of car lol
I like that this is a Toyota Hilux
The phone mount on the steering wheel must be the coolest thing I’ve seen in a moment.
If this is done normally and not just for the photo, is't it that posture bad for the dog?
Day 3458 of r/aww users upvoting pets in unsafe situations
I'm wearing the same nasa logo shirt today as the top picture! What a strange connection to seeing this picture on the front page.

Long ass car ride
༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ ❤️
I love this picture! So cute!
But super not safe but whatever... you know - heart warming lol
I'm ready for this buddy cop movie.
He gutted the car to make up for his dogs weight gain lol
That is dangerous, I have a special device for my dog
Make a movie with these two and I will preorder tickets immediately.
The hat is awesome.
Nice
I can't imagine the face of his wife when seeing this and realizing she sits on a seat where a dog gently puts his genitals on every day
I'm having trouble telling if this is actually the same car or not
where’s the inside of ur car dude? The whole back seat is missing
What happened to the stick shift?
This is so sweet I think I might have gotten diabetes
How do you train a dag to sit like that?
Not heartwarming and not safe. Yikes ...
Tell me: where is the dogs armrest? We need to know!
That's cute and that doggo became so big! lol
This is adorkable!!
Oh my god that’s so wholesome
We got new seats in the truck!  And at least two NASA shirts.  Edit: not sure why I got downvoted, but oh well.  Thanks
Dog For President
When you come back happy as shit from a fishin' trip
Doggo ate the center console 🤣
*find the 11 differences between the two images.....*

This is so adorable
The stick shift is all grown up too!!
I love this pic😍 is so cute
Ah from wee lad to drinking with the boys. They grow up so fast.
Can I see that dogs clit?
I love that he’s wearing a NASA shirt in both too hahah
So sad to see he has face shrinking disease. One can only hope he recovers.
Wow, how long does he ride? The puppy grew up and they are still going somewhere!
Omg my heart lol
Put on some underwear
I like how he said no to his cars seat devider / cupholder
Went from baby to the Dude in a matter of time.
Love this 💕
The nasa logo also got bigger
Dog's reaching for the hand-grip like my mother when I'm going 46 in a 45 zone.
I wonder what was rocking on the stereo for the doggo to be playing air guitar so fiercely?
Butthole scented upholstery
I wonder what happened to the middle seat
We all know what we are thinking
I can’t tell if it’s the same vehicle or not.
What happened to the armrest?
what if the car just got smaller
He got rid of the middle console...interesting
Man that must've been a long ass drive
This actually would be a great picture for those "Count the differences between these two pictures" exercises.
Nobody is talking about his empty car?
Him picking up the dog him putting back the dog
NASA
At some point the dog ate the armrest
love this
So cute
This made me smile
he changed trucks before he changed dogs.
Dog is my co-pilot.
Hands down- best picture on the internet
That must have been a long road trip
so cute 🥰
You looked at it
Surprised the dog will actually sit like that
So that’s his HOV lane trick.  Noice.
*dont look down on the dog, dont look down, dont look down, dont fucking look down*
Just look at what he did to the interior of that car. They grow up so fast.
The hat is an added bonus.
I was so happy to get a truck with a sliding rear window
Ok, where are the cupholders?!
At first I thought he worked for NASA, then I thought... RHD?  

But the doggo's hat really sets this off.
The puppy looks like (s)he asked if they can stop at Mc Donalds on their way home and the dad said no
Doggo 😍
He cleaned the windows  /s
RIP armrest 😭
I want this life
She even got a cool hat
can dogs drive cars?
Wow
Anyone know what car this is?  Seats and rear window makes me think it's a kei truck maybe?
The hat 🧢
Lost the center console to add a stick shift... nice.
Why did the man's head flattened trough the years?
Maybe got bonked by his doge
Doin' the old *slow down on the turn* handhold.
That’s just mah baby dawg
Pretty sure pup is a girl
Must have been a long car ride
Nice , the doggo got a sick hat!
Dogs are always the cutest things. I love the dog. Especially the hat.
Smol pp
Nice
Wow

How long has he been driving??
That's how I roll in the carpool lane
That phone mounted to the airbag.  Hands-free zoom-in!!
My mans head got rounder over time
u/TheLonelyGod97
The hat makes all the difference.
My man out here in a change of T-shirt and a new dog trying to make it look like it’s the same dog because he’s put a hat on the new dog.
She's so happy she got that hat.
The pup taught him to drive stick.
Lol he's got the rear seats up front
You guys can get out of the car now
This guy NASA's
I travelled 4 hours to get my dog as a pup, which required my first 4.hours with him in the car on my lap mostly. A good bonding session but also he absolutely loves the car, will jump in and just sit in his seat and look out the window without jumping around or being anxious.

I thought all dogs were like this in the car until most dog walkers say it's a nightmare transporting their pups
The dog's expression is saying "slow down brudda, there's spam at the house"
Pretty cool that you converted the transmission to a manual.  I also like the interior touches as well as the paneled rear window!  Nice!
🥺
that\`s how I actually look when my friend say we\`re going to McDonalds, lol
Approved
 Think the car aged the worst
From an automatic to a manual. Crazy how the years have gone
Is it the same car?
Doggo with a hat
Sweet pupper.
Looks like the weather cleared up.
Wonder who ate the center console...
I love the hat.
your head got smushed in the lower picture
Me and my son on the way to McDonald’s 
3 years later waiting in the line 
Us finally getting our food
Thank god he din't celebrate on it half way through its journey when it was a bit bigger
Wow OP has a wide range of posts that are wholesome and..uhh not so wholesome
He must be nasa himself
Flipping LMAO... 😜
You got a new TShirt that is heartwarming 😂
I can tell from the interior thats a Toyota, probably a year or two before the tacoma
Dog ate the center console
The hat on the dog 🥺
Ride or die, bitches!
Did he stick his phone on the steering wheel airbag?
That dog went from “are we there yet” to straight up fuckin vibing
Did you sell your center console?
💙
Dogs are EPIC!!!
How did the man get younger? Inconceivable
I love it so much omg
Lost the center console but gained a friend
Did that dog get cooler? 😎
Looks like his partner in crime is doing an air guitar solo 🤣
Alternate title: man rescues puppy from Silent Hill; puppy grows up to be the best boy.
Hopefully he never gets in an accident. A cellphone launched at his face at 200mph wouldn’t be a pleasant experience.
Pic 3 is them on a space shuttle.
He’s wearing a hat this is perfect
I need a new nasal shirt!
Quite a long car ride
He’s a good boi!!! So is the dog!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
Anyone else notice the cellphone mounted to the steering wheel?
Sometimes you just gotta let it breathe.
His shirt got bigger too!
What a derp
Went to profile to see more puppy pics, wrong click of the day (NSFW)
Looks like he’s just about to hit a punchline.
The second picture looks like he is pissed because she was drunk again at the bar and needed a ride home.
That is so cute
2 NASA shirts... awhhhhhh ya
He lost some car parts...
That guy is going to get slapped in the face by his phone in the event of a crash and airbag deployment. Gotta figure that's a broken nose at least
Love the hat
Man, people jump through a lot of hoops just to be able to drive in the carpool lane
Just 2 best friends
Man so wholesome!
Scooby Doo irl
Real question what happens to a buckled up dog if there is an accident?
No importa el tiempo siempre juntos y seguros...
Friends forever ✊
that must been a really long ride
That cap is the cutest thing, he can barely see out of it 😂
The car aged the most.
What happened to the center console?
❤️
❤️❤️❤️
Looks like the regular DMV line in Jersey.
This makes me happy
So wholesome  <3
Why is that dog cooler than me?
Que ternura
Anyone else played spot the difference with it?
Your pup was tiny but very big now. I love the way he’s fastened in
Damn dog ate his whole center console
Tooo cute !!
Completely unrelated but driving in the weather in the top picture is so damn cozy. I love having the heat rolling and some chill tunes to listen to while the rain batters my car from outside my safe dry space.
Love it 😍 💕
this guy on sum growing potion or am i trippin
So NASA T
Growing with dog
Did the dog eat his armrest
Oh the dog got a hat
I see one of them has learnt to smile, waiting for the other one to follow the smiley ones example!
They both got wider.
Heartwarming if you don’t mind your dog instantly dying if you get in a car crash, even going at 30mph
All in a Subaru ... Love ... It's what makes a Suurrbaaruuu.
This is like one of those spot the difference pictures
Yeah but where is the half of the car?
Live action scooby and shaggy
🍻🐕‍🦺
Well... that's a good boy ! He put on his belt !
Please tell me this sexy human works at NASA.
Now that's the buddy movie or Saturday morning cartoon I need to see...with "Running down a dream" as the theme song...
Pup ate the armrest
Aww good girl.
Love your road buddy and both NASA shirts
And the human looks the same
Look at those legs. Wish I had some
Dog is cute, bonus kei truck pic
Save
Somebody learned how to color grade
The guy is ageless.
So cute
Happy doggo 😍🐶
Adorable
That is one long ass ride
THE HAT
That dog ate the middle console
Nice
I bet he's still mad she chewed up the center console.
Where did the truck interior go?
Damn, that's a long trip
Omg that hat makes my day xD
WhAt happened to the middle place
The boys are back in town.
Someone should photoshop police in the back and a bunch of hundred dollar bills and guns in their car.
I like how the dog seems to have improved his mental health as he seems much happier and stress free in the second picture. The outside of the car also reflects that symbolism
Oh, I love this! Best friends!
When can she drive?
I want a whole series of their adventures
Shaggy and Scooby
i like how the dog is wearing a hat and waving, also does he work at nasa? the dog not the driver.
So cute.
From they’re first day in the rain and on today when it is clearest these two are meant to be together I mean look at the dogs hat and how happy he is!
Going into Silent Hill / Coming out of Silent Hill
Spot the difference. Go.
This reminds me of Interstellar
Is this okay on a doggies spine?
Does anyone remember the cartoon game  in the newspaper where you had to look for the changes in two different photos?  Seats, dog, tshirt, dogs hat, rip pants, and gearshifter.
Cellphone taped to the steering wheel is epic.
This is awesome
Put Dussy as the flair
Why'd I have to see this the day my dog died.
Oml that's so cute
Pic 2 looks like he learned to put his own seatbelt on
Aw very cute that pup has grown up !!!
So cute
I wonder what truck he is driving.
That's the life I want. He probably has an awesome job at NASA too.
For some reason, my head immediately went to”We're going on a trip in our favorite rocket ship~” when I saw this
funny
fuck it the
Shameless hussy!
That was one long ride
This dude loves nasa.
it's finally stopped raining!
"Bruh why we going so fucking fast?! Uh-*WOAAAAAAHHH*"
Humans don’t  age dogs do
A happy pup bring me joy
This is probably the most upvotes i have seen on a post, that’s cool
Aww!
Everyone: noticing he’s wearing a nasa in both pictures.
Me: the dog got bigger, but the seat got smaller?!
How long was it raining for?
How’d the driver get younger and the dog get older
Outstanding.
Dog needs proper seat belt
How old was he when he ate the center console?
A happy puppers.
Doggo seems to enjoy these car rides
Same or different car?
Carpool lane here we come! 😆
the car/truck does look different but very similar. what model is this?
life goals
 I love the top photo, reminds me of cold rainy nights riding in my mom and dad's old shitty Mitsubushi pickup truck, me watching my little brothers as my dad paid for gas and my mom bought snacks. Listening to the rain on that thin metal roof. Then we would dangerously pile all back in that one bench seat, and get home to eat some shit on shingle.
It would have been a lot less wholesome if Shane Dawson sat next to it
Long ass car ride
Dick warming. Yeah i saw the dog anus
why is the interior of the car pretty much non existent in the second pic? lol
Willy Woo?
Some things never change
I read: heartworming
yo i gotta go get my fam hold on XD
Incognito mode
Awe look at the little one lol
Are you ready
Dogs can’t sit that way.  It’s really damaging their backs.
They all go derp eventualy
