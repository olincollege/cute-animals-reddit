My old dog used to do that. If I started howling, she would make little timid howls and look at me for reassurance that it was okay. Then she would howl louder, and we would howl together for a few minutes. Then we would stop and she would be *soooo* happy. It was adorable. 
Pack it up boys, that‚Äôs the cutest thing we‚Äôll see all day.

What was the owner's command?

"Jerry, 'humph'. "

Sometimes when the whole neighbourhood is barking, our dog will go sit on the front porch and clear her throat at them. 
That‚Äôs just the sweetest thing ever. 
My dog jumped up to see why my laptop sounded so sad.

That's his inside howl.
https://youtu.be/nep3jKwVZe8 kinda reminds me of this 
I spent almost my entire 10 min break at work watching this. It gave me the strength needed to not throat punch anyone for the rest of my shift. So thanks. 
I see your small ‚Äòawwooo‚Äô and raise you an ‚Äò[oooo wow](https://youtu.be/vpHURwvblF8) ‚Äô of similar stature.

What a nice boy. He doesn't deserve to be so sad. 
I will protect your dog with my life 
My sister threw out her back last week and this put her in so much pain it was difficult for her even to roll over in bed. Yesterday night she was apparently she was making noises of pain in her sleep, because she woke up to her dog howling and crying because it thought she was in danger

Me: how small can it really be

Me: THE SMALLEST. 
I just must say that the fact that this dog‚Äôs name is Jerry makes my life. No fancy name, no wolfaboo shit. Just Jerry.

PET. HIM. PLEASE.
This is an extraordinary piece 
That'll be $350.
Such a husky! Mine goes ‚Äúarumgarum‚Äù and ‚Äúarumph‚Äù 
That's a small 350$ fine. 
He sounds like a dove calling. So cute. 
Holy crap I'm sort of relevant!

After hearing that...i just want to hug that Awoooo

It's been a month, and I still think about this tiny awoo on a daily basis. It gives me life. 
Are we sure he doesn't sense a ghost?

My dog awoos and looks sad while staring at nothing, and we're pretty sure it's ghosts.

He's so sad for those ghosts...
^awooo
Damn, where's the awoo police at
I'm pretty sure that's the Awooo of please let me out of the bathroom my extra sensitive nose can smell that taco Bell shit too well lol
Good dog is using his indoor voice!
Omg my heart!
My heart <3
My Maltese will howl if we howl at her first, but only if she's in the mood. My fiances friend came over for game night and we howled at her to show him, but she never howled back. Embarrassing. 
Someone reply to this comment so I can have this forever 
Release him

Hello world
This is so cute, I sobbed.
I made the exact same noise after watching this video. So cute.
Wow... this many upvotes for a dog whimpering? I will never understand how Reddit works, I see that now. 
That is the saddest "awoo" I have ever heard :(
$3.50 fine
I got on the internet and was completely satisfied with my life in under 10 seconds.  #ThanksDoggo
TOO CUTE WTF
Oh my god that was so adorable 
dig us gad

I thought this said "the smallest avocado," and I was seriously confused.
Shh... indoor voice!

Adopted an Anatolian Shepherd about a year ago. He grew a bit, but thank goodness he really only barks at the tree in the backyard.
Sounds like sad R2D2.

Never underestimate the power of the smallest awooo to brighten someone's day. I've watched about a dozen times.  üòÄ
I can't be the only one howling at my dog after watching this. No, he didn't howl. 
When a dog knows he lives in an apartment. :)
Should end my night with this and get off reddit now
Are we just reposting from Instagram now? 
CUTEST awooo EVER!

No awoo, although this being a small one we'll fine only $100
Oh my god 
Haha love it!

What a lovely dog
I want a fluffy owl, too!

This drove me to find how to enable sound for this. If you knew how lazy I am, that‚Äôd be impressive. That tiny awooo was worth it all
He's so embarassed I want to hug it ;-;
‚Äú..  ∏·µÉ ∏‚Äù 
That is the sound I make when I need to pee as well.

My dogs half husky half shiba inu and for some reason she very rarely barks but instead makes weird talking noises kinda like this.
Maybe he doesn't want to be in the bathroom when you're taking a shit
That howl is majestic
Adorbs!
Edit: The smallest poo
We call that our inside voice with our beloved doggo, so he barks like that, very soft, very tender. He's learned that gets a far better emotional response from me.
Seems scared üòü 
"Ooooo"

U dropping a deuce?!
This video made me get up and go all the way down stairs just so I could hear the adorable awooo

Tha would be great if I could hear on u/antenna 
$350 fine
I just watched this video about 28 times in a row. 
Sweetest thing ever
Oh, my gosh that is so cute!
Sometimes I make this sound when I'm sad
Wow! That dog was given a few pipes on him!
Man I can hear this with the sound off. 
cutest thing ever omg 
r/aaawwwwwwwww
I love him so much! Gentle husky soul. 
I've watched this 7 times in a row now. Everytime just as good as the last 
The real question is why the dog is in the bathroom with her.
So cute !  The only time my little 10 lb chihuahua mix ever howled was at the shelter.  He ended each howl with ‚Äúnyaw nyaw nyaw nyaw.‚Äù  It was this really funny little ending like he was talking.  I hope he does it again someday.
Inside voice 
You dog can see your bare feet and smell the peanuts, it looks scar(r)ed..
That's so sad! 
^^^awoo
The only time I've ever heard my guy howl was in his dreams, and it was kind of small and soft like that
That little awoo and those sad eyes - gaahhh my heart!!
The saddest boi
Can't tell if the first too noises are "buff" noises are farts
That‚Äôs water talking right there. My husky hates it unless he‚Äôs outside 
Omg awwww...hug the doggy!!!
Whoo are you?
Just look at those gorgeous eyes!
Why was Jerry staring at a wall?

This dog might actually survive The Quite Place.
We found the goodest boy, ladies and gentlemen.
Isn't staring into walls an indicator of a bad mental health issue with dogs?
His little facial expression makes it too.

Holy fuck I want to hug and snuggle with it

Was he in time-out? Was that his guilty-awoo?

Wow a million points for putting this on the world's shittiest video service that is killing my pc when I try and watch it.

More points for reddit developers for being pretty much some of the worst.
