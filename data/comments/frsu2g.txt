Wow, that is amazing! She is so beautiful and looks so healthy!

19? Babe doesn’t look a day over 6!
She's the Helen Mirren of cats
Gosh I want to look that pretty 90. 

Probably won’t happen...might not make it to 90. Hell, might not make it til the afternoon.
How many lint rollers do you own?
She does not look a day over 9! What a beauty!
Such a beauty!
She’s stunning. I have a 20 year old princess. She thinks she’s better than everyone else. 
.Lost a 20year old last year too. Here’s to old cats! They rock.
How do you keep her so healthy?
I want to paint this!!
[removed]
May she thrive another 19 years
you’re a marshmallow queen
young and sweet

Perfection!
Appreciate her every day!

Aww we needed this right now! She's so pretty :)
Nobody talking about this cat being from the old Fancy Feast commercials? 

Now I see why, I went back and watched some of them on YouTube and this cat is way more beautiful!

She’s beautiful!
Beautiful queen. What a cute happy face. You can tell she has a very good life.
❤️ Kisses❤️ and ❤️ hugs❤️
Gosh so purrdy
Kitty looks great for 19. Wow!
Had a cat that made 27, it might have been older than that by a good bit, it was a stray that stook around that long.
19 years old!?  
She looks like a 2 year old.
Royalty rite there. All hail the Queen!!👸👑
There's no way that cat's 19
That is like the Michelle Pfeiffer of cats.
Yaaassss Queen!
She looks so healthy and beautiful 🤍🤍🤍
Damn that's a good looking cat. She's like the Scarlet Johansson of cats. Definitely a queen.
wow so cute ,, love you  Marshmallow queen .
Looking great for 19! 👌
I love it when cats are ageless! My little boy is 11, but looks and plays like he’s 3/4!
This is fucking art. I almost told my cat he wasnt my favorite anymore.
r/ntbdbiwdfta
She looks like my little floofenbottom!! (Currently only 3) this is what she aspires to become!
She is so meowjestic
Gorgeous lady!
She’s a beauty!
What breed is this? Is it a ragamuffin? She looks like my ragamuffin! Beautiful.
Doesn't look a day over meowteen
Aw what a princess 🥰
Oh look, it's Petty White!!!!
A purring image of regality.
She's older than me
Cool smile!
She looks like an adorable, beautiful moth.
.... and after all this time, she still thinks you’re a jerk and is more than happy to throw dirty looks your way.
What a beautiful lady
She's a killer...quEEEEEN
What a lovely cat.
this marshmallow just melted me
Such a beauty
Absolutely majestic.
With that age, more like Elizabeth Queen (of England)
She is a gorgeous queen
[I'm sure you already do but enjoy her while you can. We just lost our ornery, yet cuddly, little lady after 17 years.](https://i.imgur.com/olUry5E.jpg)
That's a great looking cat
19? I'm 19 and I'm at the end of my life.
Wow pretty lil thing.
Still looking young as ever!
That is a healthy coat and clear-eyed cat for 19! I <3 older cats!
She’s so beautiful
Naw that’s a kitten. Little hot chocolate marshmallow
What a gorgeous little lady!
Pretty kitty
Give me the name of her face cream!!!
She looks just like my Oliver! Hes 7 and looks like a baby. Must be something to do with fluffy white kitties.  http://imgur.com/gallery/Sj2RdJY
Awww my cat's also 19 I wish you health for your little fuzzball
Honestly, I'd assume she was maybe 5. She's so beautiful!
You are the marshmellow queen, young and sweet, only nineteen
yessssss queen kitty❤️ live a long, fun filled life 🐱👑
My cat’s name is marshmallow as well!! We call her shmellow mostly!!
She is very beautiful.
That cat has aged well looks like she is ten not nineteen
I can't believe she's 19!! What's her secret??
My cat is also 19, but aging nearly as gracefully. That being said, she (Bonnie) is beautiful and precious in her own right. God, I love that cat.


Ms. Marshmallow is gorgeous, though!
Saw her and immediately thought of Dolly Parton lol
She has to have had some work done. No kitty looks that good at 19!
At 1st, I thought it’s a bunny.
How gorgeous! Looks similar to [my cat](https://scontent-lhr8-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.15752-9/90942047_642083099671713_4440023842122891264_n.jpg?_nc_cat=109&_nc_sid=b96e70&_nc_ohc=VbGoPYKOKDkAX-pYZt0&_nc_ht=scontent-lhr8-1.xx&oh=9ed11a6aa06678228d6b1327e037848f&oe=5EA8E18B)
She needs a little tiara.
Cats just know they are majestic. Another fine specimen displaying her majesty for all to behold.
God made a mistake and gave this queen 19 instead of 9 lives.
What a beautiful snowy princess!
She looks like the queen of a small, lush country
Majestic queen!
My god. This brings me to my wonderful kitty. Faack this dealing and fuck you for being beautiful.
I appreciate marshmallow
r/politecats
What a regal confection!
How do you keep her eyes so clean? Does she get tear stains?
She looks like she's a year old! She looks gorgeous <3
What do you feed her?
when was the last time you were able to wear a black shirt?
If Judy Dench was a cat, and also wasn't in Cats
Omg she's older than me and looks so adorable

My cat’s 23 and she is extremely beautiful but she’s sick of my other cats shit and punches them in the face. She’s basically my role model.
The Betty White of cats
What a pretty girl! I would never have guessed she’s 19.
Damn I though she was 3 so cute
Wow that diva is working it even at 19?!?!
Aww, I've got a marshmallow cat too! ♥️
so sweet, sitting there like a lady!

I showed Marshmallow to my mom and she commented that she was a beautiful cat
she is beautiful!!!
Now, able to join PewDiePie Army
which daycare does she use  ??? ;)
Why do cats live so much longer than dogs in captivity? Hell they live wayyyy longer than their feral brothers and sisters. Like wtf.
Yep that is definitely a cat
Omg is this a Siberian Cat?
Beauty!

Your beautiful cat is my age. Now that’s crazy to think about
I love it so much when people name their pets after food.
All hail queen marshmellow
She is Beautiful and definitely doesn't look like she is a day over 2
She's a great old lady in a cat suit, like Dame Judy Dench!!
My cat looks very similar! What type of brush do you use for her fur? My cats hair is so soft and fine that most brushes wont do anything
Beautiful! Wonderful to see how cats can live long healthy lives:)
That's a great cat name
r/catscalledfood
I feel like cats show their old age way less obviously than dogs do. I would believe it if you told me this cat was three years old.
Looks a little like cotton candy
What a cougar!
Oh my
That’s is one extremely Beautiful Cat
Still so youthful
Sliving
That cat is older than a majority of /r/teenagers
Marshmellow isn't handsome, she's beautiful.

Lovely girl.
Tell her I love her
Marshmallow Queen is my new nickname
I want to kiss her little face and butt.

She looks like 19 months (or less)
She doesn’t look a day over 7
19?! She looks far younger than that. She is an absolute beauty! I have such a love for White cats.
[WOW. She looks like an all white version of my boy Rocky, who will be 16 next month. ](https://i.imgur.com/pAMNqwj.jpg)
Looking Good ! 👍
What's her breed?
She’s the cat version of the old woman from Aristocats
So pretty
This picture is amazing!
she is a beautiful princess
The Betty White of cats: Kitty White
She looks amazing
Beauty! My cats range from 1 year old to 8 year old and I really want them to make it this far.
She seems so wise like I could tell her all of my secrets and she'd understand me
Betty White's feline familiar.
I think I need a cat in my life for therapeutic purposes.
Looks way younger than 19!
marshmellow queen?! makes marshmellows?!?!
I’m not a cat person but she’s adorable
Omg she looks exsactly like my mr.catt !
Most 12 year old cats I see don’t even look this majestic.
This cat belongs with Galadriel in Rivendell.   Beautiful.
Anyone know the breed?
Thanks u/ottertits
Such a beautiful fluff
Doesn’t look a day over 18!

Sis needs to drop her skincare routine!!
Marshmallow queen, young and sweet, only nineteen da da
She is beautiful! Though I may be biased as my 2 and a half year old looks just like her but with blue and green in each eye. I hope my Lily has just a long a life ♥️
Queen
She looks meowgnificent!
If this cat is a human, she is definitely an IG influencer.
Her fur looks so good for her age
Wish my cat was this gorgeous
She is gorgeous!
Beautiful.
She’s beautiful!  You must do a great job taking care of her.  Our Nina passed at 18 years last month.  She had asthma and kidney problems.  Your Marshmallow looks so healthy.  So wonderful!💕
Very kawai
I thought this was a kitten

Your 19 year old cat looks better than I ever did at 19
May she live for 19 more.  ❤️
We have an old grump cat that looks just like her except he has golden brown spots on his head and back. He also tolerates very few people but luckily he loves me lol
What a cutie! I love her! Hope you're enjoying life, Marshmallow queen.

She's so beautiful!
So cute baby .... ummah
She looks like Betty White
Girl aged well!
Holy moly
Bow to the Queen 🙇‍♀️
May I ask what cat breed this is?
Cat be like: "Living my best life" #KSHMR
This is a very nice cat.
Soooo beautiful!
Just curious...does she like to drink from the faucet?
Is she a PewDiePie fan?
Cats are actually immortal.
I’m impressed with how white she is..my white Devon Rex is often tinted yellow because he’s a dirty little boy.  Mostly on his belly, but he does get bathed regularly.
I'll keep it short and sweet. Thank you for this beautiful share.

❤❤
What a beautiful lady.
She looks just like my girl!
Norwegian Forest cat right?  Looks just like my cat too!
Wow so beautiful? What cream does she use?
She looks great for 19! 💙
Beautiful
She's a model!
What do you feed her? Are you doing raw?
I'm a cat person , that bein said May god bless Marshmallow and give her many more years of pain free life.
She’s perfect
I love her name, so appropriate! I'm shocked that she's 19 though, and never would've guessed her to be a day over 5.
Oh, hey Marshmallow.
those eyes!
looks like my grandma
Nice little kitty
She a wegie?
I had a kitty just liked this who lived to 18, but had blue eyes. He was the best!!! Pets to marshmallow for me.
She looks stunning, you've been a great cat parent she looks so happy and healthy! Good job!

Wow!  I've had cats get over 20, but *none* that looked as good as this.  You must take the best of care of your Queen, or be a great cat photographer, or both.
She looks like r/ThurstonWaffles
Aww.
She’s definitely had some work done. Fillers, Botox....
I wish I look that beautiful when I'm a old lady
19? she doesn't look a day past 6 years old lol
My sister wants to know what kknd of eyeliner does she use? And who is she?
marshmallow queen is more attractive than me and my entire family
What’s her skin care routine?
Fluffy
kort pittig kapsel
nice
Wooow, very cute. Look at those eyes, that fur
Sometimes I regret focusing on saving the ugly one.
Still a beautiful girl!
Lmao that cat is older than me. I hope my cats can live to 19 years old.
THIS IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BABY
She is so beautiful like nala from lion king
Doesn’t look a day over purrty.
She was orange when you got her.
That cat does not look a day over 3 years old
Damn I wish I age like this cat.
This cat is still coasting on her 2nd life our of 9, omg
You probably won’t see this but coincidentally enough my baby Marshmallow passed at 19 just yesterday.

Will you give your Marshmallow lots of extra cuddles for me please? Thank u. 🤍
Elegant and beautiful 🥰
long live the queen
A real beauty.
My heart
Your Cat is a Vampire
[This is Missis Butterpuff, she’s going on 9 years old. It’s just me and her in isolation during the lockdown. I hope she’s doing as well as your Marshmallow queen in 10 years. She’s beautiful. ](https://i.imgur.com/raFsD3R.jpg)
Wow so majestic
She doesn’t look a day over 7
Queen Elisabeth II has finally fond a worthy opponent!
Such pretty eyes!
Prettiest marshmallow I've ever seen
We should breed . Not me and you but the cats ..
Im ready to die for your cat
You’re parents replaced her at least once ! She looks 7 😂
Any idea what kind of cat this is? This is my ideal cat
She’s beautiful!
What a beauty!!
She’s sooo purrfect!
My boy George is only gone 1 he was born out the backyard where I work and I took him home, long coat just like your girl ill only be so lucky if he looks as good as marshmallow.. Your so lucky to have each other! Well done you for giving her great love and care...
A true cat Diva!
That pose makes me think of the Easter bunny! Beautiful kitty!
Wow, amazing cat!
She’s definitely an indoor cat
She looks like she should be the Fancy Feast cat
She's lovely, but I'm kinda dubious that she's 19.
How she aged beautifully! What's her secret?
Looks just like my Turkish angora! She lived to be 17 herself. Her name was Carol and she was the queen.
Gorgeous! I love cats so much lol
FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF FLUFF LFUFLFUFHFGJDF
Audrey Kitburn
They must have injected her with some of Keanu Reeves' blood to make her look this young. Wtf
The Betty White of cats.
wow !! she's cute :)
Beautiful lady!
Cute
She looks like Zha Zha Gabor, and I mean that in the most elegant sense.
Am I the only one that remembers this is a repost?
Regal
She doesn't look a day over 5! What a gorgeous floof!
Those eyes are super clear for her age.  My dachshund was 17 before she passed and had hella cataracts.
Aww
This looks like an onlyfans account picture.
This is a cute cat u/ottertits
Beautiful kitty!
Sweet little kitten face!
So cute
First of all, gorgeous cat. Secondly, your username ist just great!
All she needs now is to grow a whisker out the top of her head
It amazes me that cats can live that long. I grew up only having hamsters and guinea pigs, so I got kind of used to the short lifespan. Now I have three kitties that are only 9 months old, and I’m excited that they’re going to be with me for a long time like yours has.
i love her
I would never have thought that she was 19. My cat looks 19 and hes only 10. Granted hes probably going to be like the queen and out live all the pets that we got after him lol
Makes me miss my my Gizzy who made it to 19 as well. She was the black Swan to your marshmallow princess.
Why is this cat so much prettier than me?!
she in incredible! 😍😍



Totes adorbs! 

I read you were unsure of the breed, /u/ottertits.
She could be a Maine Coon because she looks a lot like my [Liara](https://imgur.com/a/CIpOdWm) and her little big brother [Luca](https://imgur.com/a/ZYPe1Q8) and they are both full breeds. :)
My oldest cat is 18 and solid black. Looks like her photo opposite lol
long love the queen!!!
What a beautiful cat!
19? Probably a witch in disguise
Young kitty
Turkish Angora? Like your marshmallow queen, we call ours mashed potatoes. :)
This the queen’s cat?
What do you feed her? 

I'm a dog mom with a really good fluffy white cat I found in a basement. He tolerates me well enough but we both know I don't know what I'm doing.
Giving me lots of boss ass bitch Queen Elizabeth kind of Elizabeth Taylor vibes. What a cool cat.
SHE IS SOOOOOOOO CUTE
How beautiful! She looks exactly like my cat except mine is only eight moths old.
What a sweetie
Still looks like a kitten
I am usually the guy that flies right past all the cat photos but I gotta admit, this cat looks great to be 19! Normally the pictures you see that are posted of an advanced age cat looks like extras in Pet Semetary.
Omg dasa beautiful Gato 👀 looking dapper on her bday :D
Marshie, Marshie, Marshie!

Lookin' good girl!
Majestic
She makes me want to dedicate my service to her lol.
Is she really 19 cuz if so she looks like she's like she 3
Oh she’s so beautiful!! I used to have a boy cat who looked just like her. He was the best cat ever.  Marshmallow 😍
Just had to put my cat down last week, she was 16 about to be 17
You must hate wearing black.
She is absolutely adorable. She would make agreat Marie if they redid Aristocats.
My Marshmallow looks IDENTICAL to yours at 14 years old ❤️
Awesome
Shes 70% beautiful, 20% manipulative and 10% diabolical. :)
She looks so young :3
Omg 19, she looks so much younger! She’s a beauty
She's a Persian? Or?
Absolutely stunning lady ❤️
Your cat is the Helen Mirin of cats. Aged with beauty and grace
Wow! I thought my cat was pretty old at 17 but I guess there are cats much older than her! I love this post.
I mean this in a silly + non-negative way but the cat reminds me of instamodels pose and pout. She’s even got the cheekbones for it. No filter, Botox, fillers needed of course!
Long live the marshmallow queen!
19?? Tf
White cats are so beautiful, so fluffy looking!
're marshmallow queen
Young and sweet
Only nineteen
Marshmallow queen
Feel the beat from the tambourine, oh yeah
Having the times of your nine lives.

She is gorgeous! WOW!
Plot twist: it's stuffed
19...so she's legal
"ohhhh :)"
That cat is as old as me....
She looks like she smells sweet 💙
Now I’m singing dancing queen but with the lyrics “Marshmallow queen! Soft, fluffy, and only 19!
My queen!
For a cat she got good genetics
she’s looking beautiful at 19. ...and here I am, remembering at 19 that I freaked out a little too much over bad hair days. xD ... cats are so chill.
She is absolutely gorgeous
What’s her diet? I️ want to know the life prolonging food secrets lol
Maybe it's meowbelline

 "Oh, hey Marshmallow."

WOW absolute supermodel!

I can only hope my cats are this stunning at 19. Beauty routine on point.

She's gorgeous, testament to the love she's got! She must be very spoilt

This is one of the most beautiful cats I've ever seen.
Wow, what an angel

This cat’s a year older than me
She looks 3 years old! You're a good owner!
I bet she has really stinky BM's.
Yes, the pets are still "living their best lives" I suppose.
Oh so she's legal
