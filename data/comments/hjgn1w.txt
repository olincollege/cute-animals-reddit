How long in between pics?
Are his eyes okay now? Yes they are, right?
Poor thing. Great that he now has his forever home. Lucky boy and very good human.
Every homeless animal deserves an "after" picture like that. Well done OP. Kitty is lucky to have found you
What a little love will do to change a life.
He is beautiful. Thank you for taking him in. He looks very happy :)
Looks like the best decision ever!
That’s so cute. How old was he when you took him in? Did you have to bottle feed him?
Thank you for taking care of him. He is such a little beauty.
Oh my!! What a cutie🥰. What’s his name??
You is good hooman 😭
Kudos to you for the kind rescue & adoption!!!
You are so kind! And the kitty looks so nice and cared for now :)
You is good people
He looks like a bit like my boy [Tuna!](https://imgur.com/U7GMAbZ)
This gave me the tears, thank you for loving him!
Hi! I rescued a stray as a kitten, a tortoishell kitty, and now she has a gray glaze over her eyes a year on. Does this pretty kitty have any weirdness going on with her eyes?
Serious question - what’s the turnaround time and cost for something like this? I’ve always wanted to truly rescue an animal but want to understand what’s actually involved before doing more harm than good.

Also, props for being a good person.
What a difference. Yet an other example not to judge to quickly.
i have 7 cats (1 rescued, 1 adopted... female cat got pregnant before we could neuter her and yeah) and y’all don’t understand the satisfaction it gives me to see people rescuing cats, they tend to have tougher lives on the streets... So thanks for your kindness and giving this little one a second chance
Good on ya!
I love his upright posture in the recent picture. In the previous photo, he looks beaten down.  You can tell his confidence has changed and he looks proud 😭❤️
Thank you for being a kind soul! This baby needed you....
Thank you for your kindness.
You rock
I absolutely love good people like you!! Thank you wonderful person. :)
Again, WHY TF DOES THIS NEVER HAPPEN TO MEEEEEE
Handsome boy :)
What a glow up! He also looks like he knows he's in the right place now!
What a sweetie
Damn those eyes healed up real nice.  We adopted a kitten that had an eye infection (so we thought).  However, hers never really cleared up, one eye always ran a bit.  Didn't slow her down. Her face bumps were just a lot more messy than most cats.
Very well done sir/ma'am
You are so kind. Thank you for making the world more beautiful
Good Job! He cleaned up pretty! And now you have a cat!
such a proud stature!
. You rescued him and he will give you so much love in return.  Bless you.
I'm so happy, I saw a kitten just like him on one of those sad animal commercials with the same problem
You are a wonderful human being.
He's a handsome fellow.
From skinny and scared to regally handsomely healthy! Well done OP. He’s gorgeous. May ye be best friends together for many years.
Aww God bless you and your kitty.
It's fortunate he found a human that cared, I feel like most people would ignore something like this. Makes me happy knowing people like you are around.
Looks like they are really happy and healthy now OP. I’m glad for you both.
He looks wonderful.  From the street to now - bless your heart.
Thank you for giving him a loving caring and safe furever home. My boys 🐻 and I send all our hugs, cuddles, and kisses to you young man 🤗😍😙😁😎.
So handsome now!
he's purrrr-fect
before : < w >

after : ^ w ^
Thank you for taking care of him! 😭 He deserves the best!
you're awesome
Bona Fide hero!  Thank you for adding some good to the world in these trying times.  Or at least thank you to whomever actually did this.  It is Reddit after all.
You're an angel. Thank you.
It’s enough to make a grown man cry🥺
As a cat myself, if you are going to keep him, invest in pet insurance sooner than later; if you can afford it. Pets can put you into financial trouble if you aren’t careful.
What a handsome young man! Thank you for saving him.
What a precious baby 🥺🥺🥺
Awww Thankyou OP for giving this baby a home! I adopted my cat when he was abandoned by his previous owners and it has been the best thing ever! 🌿❤️
You should do a 3 part picture in a year when he’s fully grown. ❤️
He looks amazing, keep up the good work!
Wow!
That sweet baby needed you. I'll bet you needed him too. Best love to both of you.
Very good human indeed!
Bless you. Adorable kitty
Bless you NiCallahan
"Bless you" he says with love.
Oh God that's great
Cute little guy
What's his name? He looks like a Bobo.
Oh my goodness, he looks just like my little man :')
You're my hero!
Poor little sweetie. 💜
You’re a saint, He must love you so much.
I love harlequin cats. Great job!
The universe bless u
Wow, what an astounding difference; glad to see he is doing better!! You must have greatly impacted his life and I'm sure he is very thankful! Also, what is his name?
r/humansbeingbros thank you for taking care of the kitty, glad he's doing alot better!
👍
What a pretty prince.
He’s adorable 😍
what a handsome little man he turned out to be
I love this so freaking much! Thanks for taking good care of him!
Because that's what heroes do
This will be the sappiest thing I say all day, but love really does make a physical difference.
What an amazing difference. Thank you for taking care of him.
Amazing what a little TLC can do. :)
You are a good person. I would give you an award if i could
We must know his name!
Thank you good human!!
What a handsome guy he’s turned into, so glad he found you. Poor little mite.
what a very lucky little man!! what name was he blessed with, i must know!
Nice
Awwww, that’s so uplifting to see. That cat is going to love you so much.
Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur...
Oh he’s such a cutie!!!
You’re a good person.
I used to not be a cat person. Literally almost gave 0fucks about them. After ex-girlfriend took 2nd cat I've ended up loving these creatures and took 1 my own. 

I'm now so much in love with Elvis(my own cat) and seeing in what state some of them are when left alone just boils my blood on how can someone leave them like this.
Good on you. Thanks for doing that.
That cat looks very proud to be with you in the photo at the right!
Never alone little one, never alone again.
You're awesome
You are a wonderful person and I admire that
You rule.
You are a good human
Thank you for taking care of him.
Awww this is fantastic. Good on you for looking after him!
He looks like a proper little fellow. Thank you human. But every time I see posts like this it makes me sad thinking about all the ones out there who aren’t lucky like this guy.
I’d say kitty won the cat lottery
He looks like a polite cat
No way...I think i found his long lost twin! He was stuck in a sewer on a stormy night.


https://imgur.com/a/0cOdvSD
Another comment in a sea of praise, but you're a good person for taking him in. The best part is that you not only saved the little guy, but you'll have a best friend because of it now. I've got a 12 year old living proof after taking him in as a kitten. He's a ride-or-die haha
This is a Great Post ❤️💙
Handsome is a word made just for him😍
PEOPLE PLEASE NEUTER AND SPAY YOUR CATS
I once had the opportunity to rescue a kitten from the streets (actually, stuck in a building). I took the little guy home and we cared for each other for 16 years. It was an unforgettable experience. Kudos to you, and your new buddy. 🐈
You wonderful human being. Thank you for being one of the good ones!
How incredible thank you so much. I just lost my little guy last May 2019 who I found on a highway overpass 16 years ago when he was about 9 weeks old. Makes me happy and sad.
Oh that is heart breaking, Thank you for being a kind soul, you are both precious 💔❤❤
going to hug my elderly kitty now.
Kudos to the OP for rescuing him. Super cute <3.
You can see the defeat in his eyes in the before pic. How sad. He is beautiful and full of confidence now. He will turn into a dick in no time. If he is anything like my cats I mean
His lil eyes straight up made me tear up...

Poor furry fella shouldn'thave had to go through that, you're an awesome person btw
Bless you mortal
It's enough to make a grown man cry and that's ok
Oh, poor thing. What happened to the mommy? :(
Beaten down to majestic as fuck! Thank you OP good sir/lady!!!
You are a good human being
Fuck man im near tears. I found a kitten  about 4 weeks into her life and she couldn't even walk. I was so sad. I stopped what I was doing, picked her up and took her to the hospital. My GF and i have had her for almost a year now. I can say that she brings me more joy than I can describe.
I love when people do things like that, you are amazing person God bless you ❤❤❤
Cute kitteh xD
Friend for life. We have a cat that was in bad shape when we got him ... I think they know somehow that you saved him. Our little (kinda fat) guy is the best.
wow thats a beautiful cat
Thank you kind person?
Thank you for saving him..he's adorable ❤❤❤
My heart always melts with animal progress pics.  Thanks so much for sharing
Wow! Great recovery in only three weeks, well done OP. What's his name?
Awww, I am  happy you found him. What a sweet little kitten❤️ It was meant to be!
You are awesome
A few months ago we found a kit in our yard looking almost exactly like your guy on the left. Took him to the vet, told them I’d sponsor all his treatment. One of the vets fell in love with him and asked if they could keep him. I said yes, but I wonder about the guy a lot.

Thanks for your kindness here , OP
OH MU GOD
I bet the kitten will be your best buddy for life 🌞
Thank you!
Look how clear his eyes are! You found him just in time.
Poor baby. I love him
Wonderful!!!!!!
What a difference some love makes
You are a good soul.
So handsome!
Bless you both.
Bless you, good human.
What a beautiful kitty.
His poor skinny wee chicken legs in the first pic :( and his little mucky eyes. Thank you for taking him in, he looks so healthy now!
Oh what a lil sweetoms!
Poor thing
Good kitty. He looks so fuzzy and happy now ❤️
You are an angel. May the Cat gods bless you.
Thank you for your wonderful kindness!
Second pic he's standing all majestic and proud. Such an amazing transition.
Awwwww ❤❤😊
Bless you for sorting him out!
God bless you, man. He looks like a real sweety.
He has such an adorably mischievous face ❤️
Bless your heart.
Somebody looks quite dapper.
So glad you saw him. He’s a strapping young gent!
You're a good person ❤️❤️❤️❤️

He's a cutie and is lucky you found him
What a transformation!
Bless you!
Aww he looks so scared on the left.
Thank you for saving him!
Little guy would get unlimited hugs and kisses forever 😩😍🥺
His poor eyes :( I’m glad they were saved!
What a recovery !
Last year I heard the saddest kitten crying outside, and finally located the little guy inside my mom's car. He had climbed up into the engine. Obviously it was critical to get him out, and I spent hours working at it, leaving tuna, etc. I finally recorded his crying, put a bluetooth speaker around the corner of the house, then hid myself and played him crying to the bluetooth speaker. This poor baby must have thought it was his brothers and sisters calling, because sure enough he crept out and went for the sound, only to have me block him from getting back to the car and tossing a towel over him to capture him.

&#x200B;

I know I had to get him out, and it had been enough time that his mom wasn't coming back for him. But it still breaks my heart to think of this little guy being lured out by the hope of reuniting with his family. He was only about 6 weeks old so he still needed his mommy. I don't know what happened to her. I live in a remote area so she was likely a stray and may have fallen victim to wild animals. Ugh it still kills me typing this out. Honestly I wish I had kept him, but he'd have to have been an outside cat. We took him to a shelter and I planned to visit him, unfortunately I was in a car accident either right before or right after. So I was dealing with pain and no car. It still just breaks my heart to think of him losing his family like that and what I had to do to rescue him.

Long story short, he looked a bit like this kitty so it's nice to see this.
Handsome fella! Confident with his chest out like that too. Thank you for sharing, OP.
You're an angel. He's gonna love you to bits for his whole life.
Cats know when they’ve been saved, you’ve got the best friend anyone could ever ask for right there.
Sweet little baby boy. Thank you for taking good care of him. <3
Wow this shows how a little love, care and three weeks can make a huge difference in this little kitty's life.  Adorable.
Bless you and this sweet babykitty.
I wish all kitties had opportunities like this, sadly it's not how life or the world works, bless you OP :'(
To not have the ability to be fully present in one's own senses is already bad enough, but to also be outdoors and ultra tiny!

Not to mention, feeling gross!
Wow! Thats a huge transformation. Such a beautiful good naughty boy. He looks like a mischevious lil imp!
Im proud that you cherished this animal’s life
Hes a handsome boy indeed
I am just waiting for the day that I find a kitten somewhere... I wish I could be as lucky as this!!!
awww he's looks healthy and sitting proudly! missing having a cat
Looks like my sister's cat chimi. my brother found him outside his job. Some asshole abandoned a kitten by a dumpster he texted me. so I left work and picked the lil guy up dropped him off at our house.
I went to the store to get kitten formula and wet food
Lucky for us he was about 5 weeks old so we didn't have to bottle feed him around the clock. That was last year he's big and annoying as hell but we love that lil shit.
You’re a good human being. Thank you.
He's a fine looking wee tom.
Good on you! He's an upstanding young cat now :-) (good name for a band...the Upstanding Young Cats...a trad jazz quartet, lol)
Give him a hug 

If he struggles hold him tighter then let him go
Love an food. That’s all any of us really need.
Awwwwwwww! ❤️
Intelligent boy ❤❤
I’m not a cat guy.  At all.  But I love how healthy he is now, and you can really see the love in his eyes.  He’s forever yours and he knows it.
What is this liquid excreting from my eye sockets..
Aww you are so lucky you saw him before someone else took him in!
A beautiful kitty!
❤️
He's so awesome :) pls share more his photos if it would be possible
He is a beauty. Good stuff
That is literally the saddest and cutest thing I have seen!!!
Ooooh give him a scratch from me.
Nice job for a clean up.pretty kitten!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭
Poor little fuzzy guy. Glad he found someone nice to fix him up
Amazing what a little love and care can do for an animal. He is very lucky to have found his furrever home with you!
So polite.
Thank you.
It always amazes me when a little TLC, food and water will do! Good job!
Looks like all he needed was some eye drops, food and love.
He looked shattered, thank you for taking great care of that kitty, can you pls tell him hes a good boy or girl?
He is a peach 🍑
Thank you for save him!
I see him becoming a friend for life
This warms my heart. I hope he gets absolutely showered with love for the rest of his life.
Awe, what’s his name?
He has a glow up and you can’t tell me otherwise
What a proud little dude
Kindness is courtesy of the superior mind.
Yay thank you
💕

Damn this is precious!!!
Omg the first picture breaks my heart. You are an angel. I'm so happy for this kitty
RESPECT TO OP :)
Thank you for making my day! Bless you!
Thank you for saving this sweet baby!
what a beautiful little guy!! thanks OP
😭😭😭😭💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗🐈
Wonderful job! Thanks for giving him a home!
Goddamit, who's chopping onions?!
Thats a good little fur ball~
He looks so much happier now I’m glad.
You are the most amazing human being to ever exist on this planet... all of Reddit loves you!
He turned into such a handsome young man!
Does he only have one hind leg? Also what's his name
Cute little champ
It’s amazing how rehabilitation is celebrated in the animal world and no one gives a heck about stray humans.
What was up with his eyes? Infection?
Thank YOU for being YOU! Hope he gives you lots of love and happiness!
Thank you so much for adopting him ❤️🐾
Wowwwww what a glow up!! How sweet :)
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Bless you for saving this angel 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Thank you for rescuing him!
You’re an angel!❤️
Я обязательно выживу
Is he a tri-pod kitty? Look like he’s missing a hind leg. Or is it just the picture? Either way, I would name him Lil’ Squish. Whatd you name him?
That glow up
Look at him all majestic now with his smol paws
Polite boi
This is enough to make a grown man cry
I'm so glad someone found him before he got sicker. Those eye infections can be so rough on kittens.
:’) only thing now to happen is a wild Schnoodle appearing
BEST COMEBACK STORY
Reminds me of my Korin ♥️ I found her last year crying under a car, covered in fleas and ridden with tapeworms. She's a proper housekitty now ^_^
You, are an awesome person.
I love you for this.
What's his name? I wanna pet him, i'm so glad he's good now
you are an amazing human being thank you for being so caring and nuturing
Omg..poor little mitte, I am so happy you took him in, it looks like he had a bad eye infection there as well as being undernourished. Bless you for rescuing him love :))
Aww 😍 🥰 
Thank you for saving this baby
We humans can be pretty cool, sometimes.
Beautiful animal! He is proud to have you as his human!
He lucked out when you found him.  I hope he has a long life filled with lots of snuggles and treats.
He’s so handsome!
I don't have money to give you awards, but if I could, I would had gave you all of them 'cause he's SO cute!
Just curious, how's the cat's temperament? 

My buddy convinced his wife to leave a stray kitten they found at the animal shelter instead of adopt it. They just had a baby and he was worried the cat may still be "wild" and hurt the baby.
He's so poised and handsome!!
I can already see the love in his eyes :)
Awws such a handsome boi <3
Wonderful! Thank you for taking care of him.
So adorable...
Dapper cat. 🧐
this melts my heart 😭
My heart was crushed my the first picture.  Thank you so much for taking in this little one and nursing him back to health 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Handsome dude!
Awww thanks to you! :) how loud is the little fellow?
You saved his life. Look at the difference in his eyes, poor little guy.
You wonderful human!!♡
Thank you, what a great human and happy kitten!
Bravo to you.  You are this guys hero. Mine too.
You are a great person!!! I did the same thing for a kitten I found with one bad eye
You’ve got a bf for life 🥰
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Aweee oh my goodness! Thank you for rescuing this sweet little guy 😍 he is so precious
You’re amazing for saving him.
I love you. And your cat
What a handsome individual!
Thank you
aaaaaaaw so f*k*ng cute
Omg what a handsome perfect boi
r/IllegallySmolCats
This hurts and then heals my heart
Handsome boy!
Good on you.

What's his name?
Oh hes so handsomeee
Much love
Awe my baby had an eye infection too when I found her. Sadly her eye is still super cloudy.
He is happy he is loved.
He’s sooooo cute and you rock. What’s his personality like?
Such wonderful, bright, lovely eyes!
😊
Semi off topic but I just moved into a new place and my roommates cat has brown gunk in both his eyes, like not directly in his eyes but coming down from where his tear ducts would be and I wipe it off and it comes back the next day. Should I say something to his owner or is that just a thing that happens?
Lovely. Good job bro. Consider getting some insurance for him. Good investment for the long run.
The world needs more humans like you
Yayyyyyy love a happy cat-family story❤️ he’s a good kitty
High
Bless you 🙏
He loves you so much now.
Good kitty 🐱
wow we need more people like you. that little guy is a keeper!!❤️
Awesome work, give him a skitchin for me!
He’s beautiful. You are an angel.
Go tiger! Catch all the flies and play with everything!

Looks just like my Nina. Even their stories are similar. Just worlds and a few months apart.
bless you!!
He looks a zillion times better, and also like he's smart as a whip.  Watch out for him, he'll get into your cabinets.
Bless your soul sweet sweet stranger. You and your kitten are beautiful.
Because that's what heroes do.  ♥ Thank you!
Why is it that all the rescue cats on here seem to always be found under cars?
I’d like to get a cat someday but I have the preconception that they piss everywhere and that litterboxes are a pain. This true?
He's a handsome little guy. So lucky he found you.❤❤
Cuddle him for me!!
I never had any pets and now I am curious. How long does it take to learn for the cat to know where he can pee and where not?
Look at that proper little gent
Thank you for being you. This brings joy to my heart.
He looks happy and healthy! Bless you both!!
This gives me hope lmao
That is amazing. You are in the top 1% in my opinion!
Poor little boy
Poor baby! It hurts my heart to see sick animals. I’m glad that you found each other!
My heart just exploded 💔💥😍
This has ultimately made my day better. Thank you for being awesome!
Awwweh he looks just like my little girl! So happy hes better and safe now
Wow you are a good guy man! Look at the difference. What a cute cat
Kindness goes a long way! You will get multiple good karma! Great inspiration!👍👍👍
Beautiful little man!
I would die for this cat
Bless it
SNARRFFF! Awws of the day!
What a handsome kitty!
He's improved a ton in so little time. Doesn't look like he's aged much but it's night and day. You are a good person!
how long have you known this cute little kitty
Thank you for being a great human. I wish I had silver for you.
that looks exactly like the kitten that my GF and I rescued off the street a few weeks ago. wild
What a handsome chap!
We have a tiny one like that.  When we found her, eyes were so infected the vet had to basically cut them open.  Totally healthy now.
It's amazing what you did !
Thank you for taking care of the little guy
It's so nice to see pets who obviously loved and taken care of, you are an angel for taking him in :)
Andrew horn?
He looks like a polite little fella
what a sweet prince! thank you for taking care of him 💕
He looks so dapper now! All he needed was someone to love him 💛
I commend you, kudos you my friend
This is so beautiful. Thank you for sharing and give him a big hug from all of us!
You’re an angel ❤️
Nice save!!!
My favorite kind of glo-up!
To this little person you are the most awesome angel of salvation. 🤟
Bless you. Bless you truly.
Thank you for being his angel!
God bless you.  Seriously, thank you.
oh man, was he able to see when you first found him? poor thing is so lucky to have found you
How much time between photos? The kitty doesn't appear that much older, but definitely looks wayyy better! Good job! :)
SUCH a nice boy! He looks stunning today!
Nikki Callahan from Hampton?
Little Champ is so proud and happy to be loved! ❤️
God bless you throughout Eternity for your Love and kindness! ❤️
You are a savior. Thank you for having a place in your heart for him. He is adorable
What a remarkable improvement ❣️Bless you for caring ❣️❣️❣️
Bless your heart for saving this sweet one <3
Let’s think of all animals like this.
Sweet baby. ❤️
How long was the transformation?
I may have to post a before and after of mine as well! Not nearly as drastic as this though. She walked up meowing to me when I was getting in my car for work one very cold morning and she was freezing. She had about a half-dollar sized bite on her back too. She’s wonderful now!
Beautiful kitten!
And the posture changes too. He looks like Mufasa now, brave guy!
Little buddy🥺. I’m glad you found him
Bless you.
He is precious 😭
He looks happy and healthy now. Thank you so much for saving this precious baby.
From wild stray to graceful kitty
Bless his little heart. I hope he has a very happy life going forward.
This warms my cold dead heart. How long did it take to get him so healthy?
Such a handsome little fellow.  Thanks for taking him in!  He looks a bit like my beloved Caramel. Similar markings.
How do you get stray cats to not run away
For some reason kitties with unhealthy eyes really upsets me :(
OMG, what a transformation. Love heals. Love transforms. Look what your love did! Awesome. Such a cutie. 💖🌺🙌😸
aww. thank you for taking him in. He is so cute.
It warms my heart! So cute!!!
Wow what a transformation. Thanks for saving this little guy ❤️
I love this so much. I got my baby when he was about 2 months old and his mom and litter mates had abandoned him. He was hungry, sick, and squalling. Now, he's a loving baby who knows no strangers. Cats are something special, man.
Made me tear up. Love this!
So heartwarming! Thank you
Is that mud or scars/infection on its face in the 1st photo?
You’re a beautiful soul. Thanks for sharing :-)
Youare a good human, thank you
Wow, what a transformation. Blessings to you both.

Sweet little kit.
Tfw you thought you could just make 2FA optional
So regal ❤️
Is the reason that Dogs/Cats don’t do very well by themselves anymore, because that the world has adapted so much to humans, that other animals struggle in our environment? Cause obviously if they were in the wilderness/anywhere non-human habitat, they would have no choice but to look after themselves anyway.
Good kitty!
Awe😌😇😔
You're a good human, thx for saving him.
We had a stray when i was little named rex, had a similar eye problem and some old fight wounds. Healed up and became a great member of the family, hope you get at least as much time with your new love bug as we did with rex
I see you gave him all the love. Give him more for being adorable
r/CatsSittingPolitely
OMG!! Bless his lil heart!! I'm so happy he has you and I'm sure hes happy about that as well. He looks just like my little Winston who's momma had her litter under my house and moved all the babies but left him! All 3 of mine were stray kittens by my house. 2 are now grown but lil Winston is still a wee little lad!!
:)
That is a handsome cat! Glad you both found each other, what’s his name?
You did very good! He adorable.
Awww, what a cute kitten! He looks so much healthier & happier now, thanks to you! You're a good person for saving him. Bonus points for putting the pictures in the correct oder, too. I can't stand when people make "Before & After" posts about their pets, & put the after picture first. It's seriously irritating, lol.
Wow this made my heart sink, God bless you for taking care of that cat! ❤️❤️❤️
There's no magic stream that's gonna make you explode
Poor baby! I’m so glad he’s better!
just wanted to say that caring for a kitten is so so SO tough. The amount of care and attention they need during the first 6 months is hard to manage, especially if you have a full time job. Seriously, s/o to OP, you did an awesome thing.
What a model he's become
Oh my god I'm actually crying at dinner with my family

This is what I get for having my phone at the table I guess
Went from "Do you have any food?" to "Well? Where's my food?"
Nothing better than a kitten glow up.
Aww, poor thing. So glad you took care of him :-)
You are my hero.
Thank you 🙏🏼 

This is what it’s all about. This makes me so happy and so overwhelming excited for the journey ahead ☺️.
mao?
God bless you!
Awe. I found my baby as a kitten in the same state. I had to nurse him back to health. Now he's a full grown fat loving house cat 💕.  I'm so happy you found him and  were able to nurse him to health.
You are a great person
He looks soooo much healthier! Thank
You for giving him the love and care he needed 💕
bro you stole my cat
What a cutie.  Take good care of him and he'll love you forever.
so so sweet! You're an angel.
So handsome!
So glad he’s healthy and looking better
You’re a hero for this!!
This made me tear up a little! He is beautiful, just needed some TLC.
this indeed warms my heart❤️
Well done guy !!
Bless you my friend, bless you, wow
i love little cat
He’s got a scar under his eye
When you get home at 4am vs. when you getting ready to go out
You saved this cats eyes by taking an interest in him. So many hugs and love. Keep being awesome.
What a stud! Good thing you came across him.
He looks so happy now. This pleases me.
You’re awesome!
You are a hero!
Everytime i see pictures like the first, it absolutely breaks my heart. Precious kitty babies :(
OP certified good human
You are awesome! God bless you!
Glad you saved his eyesight, with eyes as bad as they are on the left they can lose vision for life. You are awesome.
He’s precious and you can tell what a handsome boy he’s going to be!
Awww!!  Just adorable.  Bless you!
So sad, poor little thing...glad u took him in, he looks good now
He is so dainty!
This is the kind of glow up i wanna see.

We rescued a kitten 2 weeks ago that was about 5-6 weeks and skinny, so skinny.  She’s a playful, happy little thing now.

Edit: Happy to see others doing the same!
Well done, thank you for your kindness to animals. The human race needs more like you!

glad you help the cat the cat looks cute
God has blessed me
OMG I want him now! Seriously hand him over.  Im not kidding!
Awe in kitty teenager phase!
Not gonna lie, it was an ugly ass cat before, I'm really glad for him
Ahhh..... 🥺   Ok .....  I am a Marine in Special Ops .  But things like this can bring a tear to my eyes.  I feel so bad for what this kitty went through.   I am so happy and grateful that you have given him a home and love him like he deserves.
Mine was just like this❤️ sickly and on her own. Have had her for about a year now
I can see every bit of love you have this cat! He looks so much better!
Awww, bless your heart! 😻
Yay! Cutie boy
Beautiful transformation. Well done, honestly.
You are a hero and if I was not a broke ass looking for work after my job disappears from this Covid I'd gift you.  But have a hearty huzzah and enjoy the treats of live you will have from you kitteh companion.
God bless you!! I love people who treat animals with compassion and love.
😿 
This really tugs at my heartstrings..Bless you OP for rescuing this precious baby. The world is so much better with people like you in it.
These kind of posts make me want to save a cat. There’s a decent amount of strays around me but I’m not allowed to have pets
Oh, the baby was so skinny!  Thank you for caring for him! ❤
I just lost my little boy tragically the other day, this kitty looks just like him. Thank you for posting this. There will always be hope for kitties and many will live amazing lives.
Great /r/Beforenafteradoption material :)
You are a good human. Thanx for doing good in this world.
What’s his name?
Good human.
When I was little in Russia there were stray cats with kittens everywhere my grandma was an osteopath for people but she was always picking shrubs and leaves in the forest to create natural medicine, anyway long story short she used to put eye drops of black tea into kittens eyes. She said it was cheap, we had very limited antibiotics for people, let alone animals. My question is, has anyone heard of this? Do you know what chemical properties of tea would help heal infections in the eyes?
I wanna pet so bad
No, he found YOU.
This really brightened my day.
Truly amazing the effect love can have on a creature.  Human or not.
Oh the poor baby! But just look how sweet and handsome and healthy he looks. You did such a good, good thing.
You kind soul. You just made my day and brought happy tears to my eyes!
Beggar vs. where’s my FOOD!!
He is so adorable! Props to you for rescuing him!
You have a best friend for life now.  He will never ever forget this.
Well done. What a handsome cat.
Thank you kind person!
I have two cats now after growing up with dogs my whole life. I still love dogs but I’m pretty busy in my own life and they are so self independent it a lot easier. 

I really feel they don’t get the credit for being the great pets they are. It’s amazing how happy those goofy little animals can make you. I’ll probably always have a pet cat from this point on, they really do grow on you. 

And FYI adopting a cat is super easy, rescue foundations are in pretty much every state.
So happy he's safe and happy. Grateful for people like you! :)
What's his name, if you don't mind sharing?
Bless you! He looks so handsome now!!
Wow, nice save!
“Don’t judge a book by its cover”

Thank you for this. A little love goes a long way.
Aww bless the kitty!  Good job
you are a great person, hope you know that. glad that the cat found someone like you :)
Looks like an angel! Great job!
Poor baby!
It is amazing what a little love and nurturing can do, in just 3 weeks.
Bet you fed him a lot of salmon, he looks like it
You saved that kittens life. Amazing
OP, make sure you show him the pic on the left when he starts misbehaving!

🤣 J/K. You’re an awesome person and I’m hopeful for the world when I see people doing things like this.
Cute little dude
Amazing what a little love and a few meals can do.
God bless people with kind hearts like you.
Looks like Love in action.
What a distinguished gentleman!
Good work.
Look at the handsome lil man!!
Hell yeah. Way to be the best person you can be for that little dude.
You are a good human being
Beautiful cat! Mad how much love he’s radiating in such a short period of time
What an angel. Both of you.
Had the same experience with a little calico who crawled out of a back alley in Chicago. She was just a mess – I had to "dip" her in the bathroom sink to loosen and wash off all the poo and yuck.

She lived to be 17.
He’s so beautiful
So, he was hiding from you under a car, you picked him up and beat the crap out of him?

Just kidding, awesome job!
I hope you two enjoy many, many years together.
Wow you really fixed that kitty up! Looking adorable :)
Good job 👏
Such a pretty boi
Healthy young bubba
Xoxo
Kitty glow up
Tell him I'd for him

What’s up with his eyes in the first pic?? It seems like a completely different kitty.
Well done
Little hero
Aww what a beautiful kitty!!! I wish more humans would be kind and caring like OP.
Omg such a beautiful boy
💕💕💕💕💕💕
This made my entire day. I love to see this.
Cutie!
As someone who would want to help in a situation like this, what are the right things to do first, and what are things to avoid? 

I’m always worried not knowing enough could cause more harm than good even with the right intentions.
Thank you for saving this little peanut. What a beautiful boy!
You’re a good person.
May the joy and comfort he gives you far outweigh your kindness in rescuing him.
Cats are fickle, but it’s worth earning their love. :-)
Beautiful kitty
And he still is hungry, maybe not, actually poor the food anyway
Just realized that I’m going to get my cat in just a couple of days.   I am not ready at all.
Poor kitty ): thank you for taking care of him <3
OMG!! That little squeedunk!!! How cute! Did you name home yet?

I actually cried.
Thank you for sharing, he looks great!  Now it's time for him to grow into those ears!
Going to be such a pretty and loyal cat.. I'd bet somehow, in someway, it is going to save your life or the life of someone important to you.. You may never know it.. But that's ok, because you're going to have an amazing friend..
Thanks for taking care of the lil buddy! So sweet
Broke my phone and the side of the screen to upvote is broken. Just know the thought is there even though it's not done
Well done!!!

Take it from someone who took in a feral kitten 10 years ago, he knows you saved him and he will show you his gratitude everyday.
Awww!!!! So amazing 😭

Thank you for rescuing a kitten in distress.  He looks healthy, confident and happy now!  What is this handsome boy's name?
