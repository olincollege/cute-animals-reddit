I have to believe the farmer deliberately placed the bales that close together and this has been an ongoing event for a while.
Looks suspiciously like the beginning of a "Shaun the Sheep" episode...
Yeah, they are playing, "ground is lava"
I fell asleep watching this...

Edit:  wow.  First gold!   Made my day!   Thanks
Baakour
I don't remember this episode of Wipe Out
When I was little (probably around 4 or 5yo) me and my parents were driving down the highway that had pasture land on both sides. We drove by a part that had these giant bales of hay (like in the video), and I saw a sheep that had eaten it's way through the middle of one and for the next few years I believed that was how sheep were born.
I expected this kind of behaviour from goats, but never sheep
I also hate finishing things
Hol up, if there was no one around who took the video. Guys, I think the sheep are taking over.
This was so much fun as a kid, jumping from hay bale to hay bale. Don't knock it til you try it 🙃
Sheep are surprisingly agile. They don't look like they're built to do anything but just become clothes
All I see is Micheal, Dwight and Andy yelling “Parkour!”
Takeshi's Castle
Bale jumpers
It’s like a video game...
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon 


GOSH DARNIT!!
Goats with Coats
They watched the movie Tremors
Sheep are underrated.
If they can jump on a bale like that. Why does a fence that is shorter than a bale keep them in?
Sheep are just disguise goats
Hay jumping. These sheep are more wild than me.
That one with the dark head jumps last every time.

If you apply principle of pack mentality, he would be the Omega. Omegas stay behind on purpose to make sure the pack is accounted for. I know no one  asked, but here I am anyway.
Funny woolie jumpers
He is Shaun the sheep
Harold has been teaching them how to fly.
Shaun the sheep
This made me smile
They are training for the final strike against the humans. Freedom in our farm, for all animals!
Pretty common in the U.K. it’s called sheep trials.
Cute AF
I've never thought about the agility of sheep. I honestly didn't know that they could jump so high. I'm impressed, but also kind of feel like I've been lied to? Not so passive as I thought.
The secret life of sheep
I feel like I'm watching a Mario Party mini-game
Anyone else seeing the pole vaulting scene from Tremors?
Tremors 4, the Graboids are back.
The grass is the slaughterhouse!
This made me smile !
That’s adorable!
The floor is lava.
Intrepid 👍🏼
Sheep are so naughty, we had two not long ago and any building or construction we made for them, they jumped on, crashed and smashed.
I tried to count them all but I kept falling asleep
And next up on MXC - Most Extreme Elimination Challenge!
I love the lil headbang the do after each jump haha
Shhh, the hay finally fell asleep.
I really wanted one to roll backwards to see just how good these sheep are.
I think they need some dedicated climbing area
The poor slow one, trying so hard. Baa
So that fence is way too low then
part of the reason I'm vegetarian is I cannot justify taking life away from these little durps
Friends not food ♥️
Please stop killing and eating these beautiful creatures :(
Feels like we’re counting sheep in someone’s dreams.
Are those Farmer Hogget’s sheep?
Training for the sheepitary, unbeknownst to us humans sheep have been doing this for many years and rumor has it they are almost ready for WW3
One of them will be the next American Ninja Warrior.

This is what I see when I count sheep at night
Maybe theyre training for American ninja war-sheep

This gives me Minecraft flashbacks.

It’s time for mXc! Most Extreme Elimination Challenge! Now here are your hosts...Kenny Blankenship, and Vic..ROMANO!
I like how none of them knew what to do once they got to the end.
Always wondered who was throwing sheep shit on my hay bales.
He’s Shawn the sheep 
He’s Shawn the sheep 
He gets up to no good when he knows they cannot bleet 

If you give him time 
He’ll end up fine 
Oh come and bleat with Shawn the sheep
Oh let’s go and meet with Shawn the sheep
1..2..3.. *falls asleep*
I want a movie about them
They are training for junin exam
But....why not the last one ?!?!?
As a kid, I used to do this at my uncle's farm. We would come back to the house with hay in our underwear haha
I felt asleep mid video
I have no specific rhyme or reason, but I frickin love this so much.

Just adorable, they find amusement in such little things as we did when we all were kids! Shared and saved:-)
***Hardcore Parkour !***
Silly hoomans hay bales are for skipping!!!!! Lol
Reminds of that scene in the first Tremors when their all pole vaulting across the boulders
He's that most dangerous of animals: a clever sheep.
Sheep farmers daughter here. We always put bales and make little dens in our fields so in lambing season the lambs can play and keep cosy. 

From about 2 weeks on they just play and play and play. Then it tails off from about 6-9 months... and they never play again. Sheep are achingly sober. 

I think ones with a bit more goat in them like soay and Jacob might have a bit more personality.

I bet they can hop over that fence if they tried. It looks smaller than the hay.
The new sheep fx game looks incredible!

It's so cool that animals have sense of entertainment. Entertainment is literally older than humankind so let's just enjoy ourselves till we can.
I fell asleep, what happened?

Total wipeout's big red balls right here but for sheep.
Aww, seems like they didn’t want the fun to end. So cute.

would anyone know how i would save this as a video if i wanted to?
Why are they doing this?
Harcore parkour
Hay reasing
This is the most adorable thing I've seen this week! Maybe this is how sheep fall asleep, thinking about jumping on hay bales.
I didn't know the Welsh had their own total wipeout??
Welcome to total wipeout Wales, here we have the three sheep group "third wheel bailers".
Why do I feel so agh~~~ sleepy~~~

Goodnight
They're re-enacting the boulder hopping scene from the movie Tremors.
Man this video is making me sleepy
Your quality is so shitty that at the and the sheep look like big babies jumping and the scare the shit out of me !!! Nice
Now I know what to see when I can’t go to sleep.
Baa ram yuu

It’s the sheep version of Total Wipeout
It's always fascinating to me when other animals show that "Why? Because it's fun!" instinct humans act on.

I'm no sheepologist but I think there is someone around to film them
I’ve always aspired to have a group of friends that wanna do stupid shit
How many are there.... zzz.

So this is why I have so much trouble falling asleep
He's Shaun the sheep he's Shaun the sheep
Omg. You guys remember that old program Sheep.exe?  I would open like 11 of them and let them run all night. Their little sighs made me so happy. 

This is like the irl version of that, and the full blown grownup version of that. And it’s making me consider becoming a farmer.
This made me sleepy...
Can sheep even do that
Were they raised by mountain goats?
This crossfit shit is getting out of hand
"Come on laaaaaads, we used to be mountaineers!!!!"
I'm tired of the city life. This looks relaxing to live here
This plays like a shawn the sheep episode
This is literally how I count sheep to fall asleep. I picture them jumping from barrel to barrel, like they’re on American Ninja Warrior, trying not to fall of and miss step. It’s more entertaining and I fall asleep faster lol
Like the movie tremors, hopping rock to rock to avoid the giant sand worms.
1...2...zzzz
The winner doesnt get slaughtered for at least a week! FeelsGoodMan
They’re training for Ninja Warrior
So those images of counting sheep as a little kid weren't too far fetched. And you lying.. someone's recording so someone is around!
The video only stops because he fell asleep.
this trailer for the Tremors reboot is pure gold
It dawns on me that this is the equivalent of human beings jumping across dinner tables.
Move over three little pigs, it's all about the three little sheep now.

Anyone else start getting sleepy watching this?

This was already more fun and entertaining than the entire goddamn Secret Life of Pets movie

Can confirm, sheep are mad and most likely have a secret underground society
I just smoked one, this is so pleasing to watch! You normally don't see sheep being very active.
Anyone else sleepy after watching this?
They are not sheepish at all!
I like how they were completely spent by the end and were like, "so close and yet so far".

I guess Wild Mike is gonna be lonely tonight
American Ninja sheep
I've learned from Shaun the Sheep that sheep are up to shenanigans when humans aren't looking.
This is the most innocent thing i've ever seen today.


After my dog.
Man, even sheep don't want to beat the last boss in the games they play.
Baah-kour
What the sheep media doesn’t want you to see
This is how they plan escape, they learned from the Chickens.
/r gifsthatendtoosoon
They stopped at the second last one because they don’t want it to be over :(
First sheep is an American actor teaching others how to escape.
In their dreams they're mountain goats.

Tremors 12
I worked on my buddy’s farm for a summer with a couple other friends. Honestly, we did shit like this all the time. I get it.
I did the same as a kid, except of half-burried tractor tires
Done that before when visiting my grandparents farm. 8/10 would recommend
Thanks for putting me to sleep.
Leave them alone, they just quant to record a parkour video for their new YouTube channel
There are survivor
One time I was driving with my mom out in farmlands and we passed this corral that we always enjoyed going past because is had an odd mixture of animals. There was a single humped camel, a double humped camel, a zonkey (zebra and donkey mix), and several little goats. This one time we passed though the single humped camel was laying down and all the goats were a little ways back from him in a line and they would take turn running at full speed running up the single humped camel and using him as a ramp to vault from in order to land on the back of the zonkey. If they fell they ran back to the back of the line to wait their turn again. It was one of the funniest things in my life but sadly no video of it because this was before the rise of smartphones everywhere.
I was hoping they would turn around and start over.
looks like about 7, maybe 8 feet
Where is the edit with Michael, Andy, and Dwight?
tomb raider mansion training grounds
They turn into goats.
As they got to the end of the bales...all I could think of is "KOWALSKI, ANALYSIS"
The cameraman is called „No One“
They would own the big red balls.
They do be doing parkour tho
The accuracy of this tho. I’ve witnessed my neighbor’s goats do some weird rituals when nobody is around...
Farming Ninja Warrior?
It's like you story except with sheep
Someone develop the app pls
That has to be Ireland

Wipeout sheep
TIL sheeps are furry dogs
A sheepish way to end the parkour.
All I wanted was for the three of them to jump to the last bale and start log rolling it into the sunset
Did anyone else hear Mario music in their head while watching this?
Aaand they stop at the second last one because they don’t want it to end
The larger problem here is; "Why are you spying on your sheep?"
Bridget!
Hardcore parkour
JUMP TO THE LAST ONE PLEASE
If the Tough Mudder taught me anything, these sheep are going to have their calves absolutely seize up as soon as they get off those hay bales, and they'll be unable to move for five minutes.
Don’t. Get. Eliminated!
They look like Val and Earl dodging graboids on the rocks in Tremors lol
I’ve been counting sheep wrong my entire life

Y’all let’s get Sheeping !!!

I feel like I’m watching barnyard but with sheep
I think we should stop calling animals, animals. We should just call them junior people instead. They share so many of our qualities. They like to play too.
If no one is around, who was filming?
I was talking to a farmer once about sheep - don’t ask - and he told me from the second they’re born they are trying everything possible to get themselves killed. I think he had a point...
What about the last one ?!
**Its Shaun The Sheep, Its Shaun The Sheep**
Welsh Ninja Warrior
So Shaun of the sheep is based off a true story
They’re practicing for when you go to sleep at night!
Thinking meat!?
Sorry, I fell asleep while watching.
I was really hoping they were going to Scooby Doo one of those hay bales and start rolling it away, crash through a fence with it, and just peace out into the sunset. I knew it wouldn't happen, but it would have been funny.

Sheep and goats will find very creative ways to entertain themselves, it's amazing. We gave ours toys to play with because they'd get bored, figure out a way out of the pasture/own, and show up at the back door of the house.

These around bales of hay are illegal because the sheep can’t get three square meals a day...
How many times do I have to tell you, "Don't play on your food!"?

Well that’s fookin precious
Wasn't there a show or a movie made of claymatjon like that? It's like about sheep doing weird shit when their owner is not around? Not Back at the Barnyard, I'm talking clamation. Maybe it was just a dream. 🤷‍♂️
they are missing the rolling hills..
Ultimate Sheep Warrior
Reminds me of Takeshi’s Castle
It's my belief that these sheep are laborin' under the misapprehension that they're birds. Observe their behavior. Take for a start the sheeps' tendency to 'op about the field on their back legs. Now witness their attmpts to fly from tree to tree. Notice that they do not so much fly as... plummet.

How do they do that being so. .  .. round?

I love that there's an obvious leader leading them astray taking the first jump every time

As a sheep farmer I would be fine with this.  Good exercise to build up muscle mass before they meet the butcher.  

We usually run them up and down a large hill in our pasture.
They are training to escape

Don’t have such low self esteem.  You’re a somebody to me!
I don't know... The bales are round.

I want to like this but knowing they get sheared so quickly that the farmers cut skin off, then get stabbed in the throat after, I can’t. They’re such docile creatures too and just take it without fighting. So sad :( humans are cruel.
Parkour!

Me as a sheep
"Parkour!"
Log Drop from MXC
Parkour!!
I love how their heads bop up and down after every time they hop
Parkour! Wait no...Bahkour
And what exactly are the commercial possibilities of ovine aviation?
Super-unsatisfying that none of them fell
That's what us French call "saute-mouton"! 

(Literally translates as "sheep jumping", but that's actually the translation for the game leapfrog.)
When they get to the next-to-last bale, one of them does their best Samwise Gamgee,  "If I take one more step, it'll be the farthest from home I've ever been."
That's the best thing I've seen all day!!!
“Floor’s lava!”
leap sheep > leap frog
Sheep doing parcour is so cute
Paaaarcore
They’re playing Sheepfrog.
Baaaahhh
But they cant jump a fence?
HMS "hold my shearer": while I jump across these hay bales.
To quote Snoop Lion, "Is this what white people do?"
What more proof of a soul do you need.
If I take one more leap, it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
Takeshis castle sheep version :D
Follow the leader leader leader, follow the leadah!
When we had sheep back in the day they were the clumsy as heck and would slip and fall down the hill all the time. These sheep seem to have been on the strength and agility training regiment.
I think of them as grazing and munching grass and dealing with the boredom only because playful sheep isn't a thing.
PARKOUR!! PARKOUR!!
Fuck. They're training already. We need to be prepared for anything.
I never realized sheep could jump that well.
Then, who recorded it?
Welsh Ninja Warrior
Parkour for dummies.
Looks like we found Shawn the Sheep and his Friends
PARKOUR!
Maybe they're hiding from [graboids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfAS7ONO8OU).
Takeshi's Castle!!!
I think they tried to do the last jump together. Who has the full video?
Looks like someone’s having fun 😆😆😆😆😆
