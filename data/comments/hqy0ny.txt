Well that was just entirely too cute, omg
Happy bun. Used to have one. I miss that.
The popping behavior is a sign of a seriously happy bun.
Calm the frick down you maniac...flop...awww I gotcha.
Shiba honored by bun bun flop
I love how chill the dog is, just sitting there as his bunny buddy hops around <3
Can you house train rabbits/bunnies?
I love the flashes in their eyes.
Bunnies are so adorable when they flop
He got thhe zoomies

Oh cool the new beastars season came out

They flop over when the feel safe, not "beside their protectors". Nice repost

I think this is what MLK Jr. had in mind
How can you repost one of the most upvoted posts on reddit and still get 5k upvotes
I saw my sister's bunny "flopped over" on his side one night, and I got worried. So I googled it and read that they do that when they feel safe.

Woke up the next morning, turns out he was dead. :D

Really cute 🤗
I love this community
Lol yet my rabbit had angsty teenager energy his entire life (sadly he passed away a month or so ago)
The jumps with a twist are called binks. A binking bunny is a happy bunny.
That is so fucking adorable!!!! 😍
Mom said it’s my turn to repost this
I came here hoping for a link to a sub of bunny flops. Is there really not a sub for bunny flops? I am disappoint.
"Jeez, will you knock it off, I'm trying to sleep here..."
Very sweet, almost restores my faith in bunny cuteness. I used to feed our neighbour’s rabbits when they went on holiday. One was a real sweetie but the other was a total psychopath that growled (literally) at anyone who went near. I had to pour the food into the bowl from high up or it would come running and grab the scoop to try to get it off me.
One day I went to feed them and a fox had got in and almost completely devoured one (I only found the tail). Of course it was the lovely one that was gone, the evil one had probably done an imitation of the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog so the fox had taken the easy option. 
Mind you, it was a white rabbit so maybe it really was the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog!
So cute..😘
❤️
My kitty who I decided wants to be a bunny does this all the time. 😻😻
This is amazing. I too have a Shiba Inu (this same dog breed) and I can't imagine a bunny being so comfortable with him. My Shiba has met 3 bunnies in his life. He ate them. Literally caught them in our backyard & ate them. I found heads & some feet.

Fun fact: blood is surprisingly easy to get out of Shiba fur.

Not so fun fact: blood is surprisingly hard to get of a kitchen tile floor.
Also looks like the bunny was doing their “happy dance.” Bunnies and guinea pigs will jump, twisting their head and body in opposite directions while in the air when they’re happy.
That’s so adorable 😍
Sometimes my Collie would do the side flop thing as my bunny protected *him*. Jasper was a flemish giant cross and he was a very good protector.

Why is every bunny post titled "Bunnies do X when they feel completely safe" ?
D'aaaawwwwww <3
Shib just like "you okay bun?"
I love my bunnies, and im glad people are starting to realize how good of a pet they can be if treated properly
i love this
Also, that funny wee hop/jump is called 'gamboling'.
Waking up to this has started off my day in a very positive way! Thanks for such a heart warming video.
Going to be a cool day when an original posts sneaks back into this sub.

Wish my bun and doggo would get along... sadly he tries to take a bite out of her every chance he gets
Is that a Shiba or a Jindo?
That wolf is just not hungry. Yet.
Binky!
My little bun used to freak out when she eveb smelled a dog. I remember coming home from my friend’s place whom has a dog and my bun absolutely flipped out when I went near her later that evening. She refused to come near me and my wife until after we showered. 😂
I've only ever seen bunnies hop in cartoons. This was really sweet!
Would love a rabbit.

Unfortunately, my dog is a greyhound. I don't think the scene would play out like this...
I love when different types of animals are friends!!!
Gud shibe. Shibe protec. But shibe also nap.
I've heard that before. Our floppy friend does it! That makes me feel good.

This reminds me of the wolf and bunny characters from Beastars
Those eyes look funny
My heart just melted.
When the dog snuggled in ahhhh so sweet
Well I see Bunnicula and Harold. No Chester or Howie though.
So this explains Haru's behavior in Beastars
So cute
D’awww. I had a bunny growing up, a little Dutch one with black and white fur. He was amazing, and it showed me just how much personality rabbits have. He was litter box trained, would follow me around if I started shaking the cheerio box, and liked to sleep under my mom’s side of the bed. Once, my mom became very ill - she could barely get up and walk around, among other things. That rabbit refused to leave her side, and would move to whatever part of the bed she was lying on, be it day or night. When she cried after hearing some bad news, he snuggled into her lap and started licking her arm. He was such a wonderful pet.
How did a repost get 83k

repost but cute
The dog is like, jeez go the fuck to sleep bro
Oh god, everytime I see a bunny close to a dog I get so anxious.  I lost two bunnies because where I lived people let their hunting dogs run loose and I let you put the rest together.
Mine lived to be almost 11 years old. He was one of the left overs from Easter. He was black with under coat grey and shaggy bearded rex. Apparently noone wants a darker colored rabbit for Easter when they irresponsibly buy one for the kiddos. The dude was awesome, and he knew how to tell me things without words and a great problem solver. Also a bit bitey and aggressive at times and liked to play tricks of sorts. He didn't spend time in a cage ever,  free roaming and always used a litter box. I never expected to get a rabbit as a pet. He was scheduled to be pit down the next day if noome got him, because he was no longer cute and little. His final resting spot is in a friend's flower garden in Virginia.
I have again chosen not to eat you fluffy now please the decorum is one circle then flop.
“I am the great shibe, my slumber has been interrupted, what may you want?”

“This is acceptable”
“You done being a spaz?” Good!”

Bunny: Hops around

Dog: WTF are you doing? I just want to sleep

Bunny: \*flop over

Dog: WTF... ok at least you stay still now. I'm fine with that :))

That popcorning at the start reminded me so much of our now-departed guinea pigs. Sigh.... :-(
She like lay the fuck down please!!!
True, my family flops on me all the time
This is very cute
those little hops in the beginning are called binkies, and they do that when they're really happy.
My rabbit doesn't do binkies. She just lays around all day.
Bunnies are just cats with long ears.
Aww, look at that safety dingo being so calm with the bun jumping and flopping near him
I have a house Bunny and he Binky's around like this all the time. So sad that people will never see their rabbits doing this because they lock then in a small hutch outside.
That's a stoic Shiba
Too much cuteness to handle.....
Omg this is too cute when the pup snuggles to the bun
Hoppity hoppity floppity.
My big boy cat does this when he knows he's been bad OR when we come in from outside (omg you were gone FOREVER) and he wants pets. The belly exposure is a common sign of trust or submission in animals as it's a weak part of the anatomy.
Doge is gud boi
No play? Ok, cuddle!
This is one of the videos the finally convinced me to adopt a bunbun from a rabbit shelter.
Munch
Funny that my King Charles Cavalier had a chew toy exactly similar to that bunny and loved to pounce on it and chew tf out of it
How do you get to this point? That's a lot of trust by both animals to have gotten here
Awwwwwwwwww! So cute. My bun did that with me when we hung out at the park. I would read and she would nibble on dandelions and cuddle with me. I miss having a bunny.
Hoppy hops
what type of dog is that? looks pretty cool!
I thought that said “predators” at first and I was like wut -_-
u/vredditshare
Had a couple pet rabbits on farm. They bred quickly and one fine day I took one of the babies outside to eat grass on the plain. It was super excited and started running free in the field. I was scared it would run out of sight so I chased it down. As I caught up it started freaking out and squealing something awful. I caught it and put it back into enclosure, didn’t take the babies out after that lol.
I thought that was called "binking"
"I'll protect you little one"

"Thanks bruh"
If I had ovaries, they'd have exploded into pink glitter.
love for the kindness.
Doggo is thinking, WTF you jumping bunny?
*bounce* *bounce* *bounce* *bounce* *bounce* *bounce* *plops over*
Is there a sub for just bunny flops? Because there should be.
Those eyes creep me out a bit
Wait what bunnies can only hop? Am I stupid or something I thought they could walk like a dog or something
Like my cat when she wants belly rubs. It's a trap!
“Settle down, Tony, it’s bedtime already.”
shibe is havin none of it
Thank you for the daily dose of serotonin
I had to take care of my neighbour's bunny for a week. For first 2 days, it maintained a distance. Then it used to play around me like this.
There is some pure good in this world after all.
so nice
THE ENDING MAH GAH
Awww, their heads close together like best friends.... That's such a nice thing to see first thing in the morning:)
My bunny did that when I was a kid! I didn't know it was because of that :D inner childhood is so happy.
I wish they weren't illegal in my state! Sooooo adorable.
Hey bud!  Hey bun.
I love how he snuggles up to the bun right aftwr
Used to have a bunny who would let us hold her, flipped over, like a baby in our arms. She was an amazing companion.
I used to bunny sit for my neighbor and onetime I was playing with her and she jumped into my arms and just flopped. I laughed thinking it was floof being clumsy but I know now that she was feeling safe around me
Wish I could get one but they are illegal where I live.
They also jump all spastic like that when they are happy =)
That first time introducing a bunny to a dog took guts
Is cute

Oh my goodness I love it so much!! We have a bunny and I love when he just stretches all the way out to be in major chill mode
I love how at first the dogs like "Bruh can you stop"
That was the most precious thing EVER
Dinner bouncing around. What's not to love?
I'm not sure I understand why that dog is not eating that rabbit.
Rabbits are the best pet
Bunnies go from frantic activity to a nap in nothing flat. I envy their abilities.
On slow days the repost accounts really stand out as obvious.
Adorable!  =D
Number 3 on top. Really thought we wouldn't notice?? And awards too?!?!
Legoshi, is that you?
Is the bunny jumping around like that before flopping over kind of like /r/Zoomies or how dogs dig to make a bed right before bed?
Oh good heavens the precious
Awww doggie loves bunny and wants to snuggle his head up against bunny.
I miss my bunny.. he lived his full life and although his last months were his hardest (he was getting sick and it’d be hard to move/eat) I’ll always cherish the times he’d hop around and on my chest and flop over like this. I could never get another rabbit though, the heartbreak is so intense because you spend so much time and energy taking care of them. He literally was like my child. When he got poop in his fur I’d clean his behind, I’d cut his nails, play with him, do the most I could. They night he passed was a hard one. Finding him spread out lifeless in his favorite place to sleep was tough. I wish I could’ve been there when it happened. It still hurts. My boyfriend and I buried him and placed a salt rock on his grave. I miss you shadow. I hope I made your life a nice one. From all the handmade toys to rabbit poops on my pillow, you’ll always hold a special place in my heart. 😢
If only you could house train bunnies.

My guinea pigs do this too!!
>That’s completely irrelevant.
My guinea pigs do this too!
Doggo looks like my Akita! I just need him to be that calm around our cat
The dog was like "wtf u doin"
this animal is really attractive ☺️☺️ and everyone should have one of them
I audibly gasped
Karma grab
I find it  appealing that they both have the same level of fluff. It’s like an art style irl
That is some aggressive flopping.
It moved like it's in a video-game and is restricted the dodge roll mechanic for movement.
*plop*
It’s called a binky and they do it when they’re really happy. My buns do it a lot when we take them outside in the long grass.

I have a cat and a bunny too and they both get along with each other. The cat has grown up with the bunny so he always likes to lay down and watch him. He will sometimes walk up to him and scare the bunny by putting his paw on him but it’s usually because he likes the feel of his fur.
Dude this is the top 3 post of all time on this sub dont repost kids.
Isn’t this a repost of the top post of all time?
Oh my heart! 😍
All I want in life...
Aww, that little white belly ❤️
They also "binky" (do spaz jumps and frolics) when they're happy
And thus, Nick and Judy lived happily ever after.
Bunny was also doing binkies before the flop.
Can you potty train a bun bun?

Okay well now I'm crying on a Tuesday morning so that's nice

That last little snuggle is so cute
OMG, the heads together at the end! Precious!
This is so adooorable.
On the other hand, my Shiba massacres any and all bunnies that enter our yard.
Its so cute. I needed this
I like buns and I can’t lie...
This made my heart lighter. So innocent
There’s a wild one outside my house that sometimes does that in the garden. I named him Peter because he likes to eat my garden. He’ll lie down on the mulch when I’m on the back patio and stare at me
Bunny isn't going to be safe for much longer if it keeps kicking poor doggie in the face like that.

My guinea pigs would do nearly this exact routine with my giant cat. (He would vet into the cage and just chill, like "thx mom!". Obviously I was cautious at first but there ended up being no need lol). It's sooo precious when they do their little popcorn jumps and flops.
my bunny peed on me when I put him on my lap
They are all loved on and strictly free roaming inside! It’s a bit of a zoo around here.

"You are strange, snoutless bounce doggo, but I shall protect you."
Guinea pigs do the same flop. I took my piggy to my mom to babysit a few days, and when Jubie saw who she was staying with she flopped down with a sweet sigh.

Are they litter trained or do they just kind of leave a Hansel and Gretel thing around the house

I've always wanted a bunny. I know these kinds of bonds don't always work, but you've given me hope. 😍
IM GONNA DIE OF CUTENESS
My bunny always did this thanks for the info it made my day knowing he felt safe :)
Bun said let’s zoomie, doggo said let’s zzz, so bun flopped in response and doggo cuddled closer
I have a huge red and white Malamute with these markings! This is too cute!!
Well my heart just melted
Soooooo cute 😗😗
I've seen a lot of comments stating wanting to purchase one bunny, please if you are purchasing not adopting get two. I don't want to cause trouble apologies if I have but from owning rabbits, rabbits are a companion animal. However if you decide to adopt the rabbit will be a lone bun and that's ok because that's what that buns used too or you might be able to adopt a pair of bonded buns.
I have a bunny. Can confirm.
I mean, that’s not 100% true. They just need to be comfortable wherever they are.
I’m not crying, your crying.
I miss my bunnies :(
I can be playing with my Boxer and my partner’s bunny will just stay flopped over in his little corner, the only time he actually gets up is if he gets hit with a ball
My boyfriend made my day by sending me this! 😄
My little bichon goes on a walk with me early every morning. We have a plethora of wild bunnies in our neighborhood and we pass by a bunch all through our walk. My dog wants to just introduce himself to the bunnies so badly but does not understand why they run away every time he tries to go near them. It hurts his feelings. He wants to be thier best friend
I would have said aww, but this is r/aww
Thank you I needed this!

Haru-senpai? Is that you?
Cute and all, but this implies wild rabbits seek out larger animals for protection.  Is this true?

I love when rabbits and french Bulldogs flop down with legs straight out behind them.
Bunny: "Look what I can do!" /mouth sound effects while doing elaborate acrobatics

Dog: "Kid! I say, kid! You're doin' it all wrong, ya see?"
This is too precious. Love how excited he is to flop next to the dog aww.
This just made my heart melt. So cute
I honestly said aww out loud when that dog laid his/her head next to the bunny.  How much God blessed us with so many amazing creatures.
Our bun does it all the time when the dog goes in to visit her. They sniff noses then she flops against her fence.
So cute and adorable ❤️
So adorable 🐇
ITS TIME FOR GRANDMA
Omg how adorable! Is that really true??
my eyes are sweating
This was so wholesome that it made me cry
Ma heart n soul
So does this mean the bunny doesnt trust the dog?
Doggie sniffs in a "you're done now right? Awesome... you make a great cuddle buddy when you aren't jumping off the walls"
Nice moves. It seems the baby is happy with the mummy's company

This is so startling when the rabbit does it for the first time!
idk why but first time i feel like crying from something so cute
How does the bunny not shit all over the bed?

My bun likes to wait for my other dog to lay down on the floor and plays with her tail.

I had no idea bunnies did that--they typically seem so timid.  But that honey bunny is totally into that dog, and when it couldn't entice it to play it just plopped next to it and was out like a light.  That has to be one of the cutest things I've ever seen!  ／(=∵=)＼
And bopping them on the head.
