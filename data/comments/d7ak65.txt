Teething is such a pain, for all involved. I had to keep a close eye on my baseboards, because regardless of the bazillion teething/chew products I got, my pup would pick a corner and lay there while she scraped it with her teeth.
Imma piranha. They live in the Amazon.
RIP all your furniture
I had a puppy like this. We called her our ‚Äúsafety coordinator‚Äù, since she used to chew the corners on all our tables. You know, for safety. Can‚Äôt have her people bumping into the corners of coffee tables.
That‚Äôs Sunny Baudelaire
Hope you didn't like that table too much üòÖ

I hope OP enjoys the "distressed look" in his furnishings
You table is vintage now
Surveying all that is his
My lab was insanely destructive as a pup.  Name it, he chewed it up if he could get to it.  Steps, baseboard, plants...  Just an adorable ball of love, but man did he wreck things for a while.
You can get chew roots in most pet stores, there are perfect for dogs. So they chew and don't have the risk of getting an splinter into their mouth. Which can be really painful for them.
Did you name him Sunny? Cause that'd make me laugh.
My parents had a solid oak dining room set. Beautiful. Cost a fortune. Our chocolate lab teethed in the front edge of each seat. Just the edge of he seat, nowhere else. So now they have a lovely solid oak dining room set with teeth marks on the seat edge.
Those puppy teeth look very sharp!
Looks like he might add a few more unique distress marks to your table there.

Think i have the same coffee table, just not scratched to shreds
Their teeth are so sharp at that age too. Lol chomp face
Can confirm have similar photo of my wee piranha who grew into a big 12 year old blonde floof.

What a cute piranha! I have a kitchen chair that was teethed on by my old boy and it makes me happy
Give me the treats Karen

As the joys of puppies!  Sit in your wooden rocker and fall forward? Front rocker chewed away. Have a nice leather Stressless chair, arm chewed off after a nights hard work for a puppy. Oh, well, it's just stuff and they grew into such lovely ladies!
Omg he Can Can bite me whenever he wants D: so cute
At least the pupper is not chewing walls, yet. Mine loved walls.
He's a wood...chupper?

Lol look at those sharp puppy fangs! Make my hands itchy just thinking about them
I dunno...that looks like a land shark to me ;) Either way, it's darn cute!
This is the cutest thing in the world when it isn't my furniture.
So that's what a land shark looks like. Good to know.
I see you are entering the ‚ÄúI hope you didn‚Äôt have any use for this‚Äù phase. Godspeed my friend. Godspeed.
We got our teething pup a rubber, fillable popsicle toy. We filled it with water, froze it, and let her chew on the rubber coated ice. It'd melt more slowly than an ice cube (and typically cleaner), and the grippy rubber made it easy to handle. Highly recommend!
I'M A PIR-AN-HA, FROM THE AMAZON

I had a 5 year old greyhound do this to a glass table in a hotel restaurant once... Just for attention.
Dont wear long sleeves...speaking from experience. Friends dog was and still is a psycho for sweaters

Piranha actually are actually not aggressive , they nibble on dead flesh etc.
That's a fierce looking beastie.
3.5 months? I remember mine.  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, so adorable yet incredibly destructive.
omg his sharp little teeth!!!! I'd let him nom on me all day
Nom nom nom what an adorable puppy!
I'mma piranha.

Piranha retriever haha
Is he/she a Dudley?
if his teeth are hurting bc teething etc frozen carrots are a good way to help soothe the gums plus stop them from chewing on furniture or you can try chamomile ice cubes which also help soothe them overall!!!

I‚Äôm having a really stressful day dealing with some family health problems but this made me smile very big. Thank you.
Just waited 2 minutes for something to happen in this video.
If I'm not mistaken that would be a pupiranha
At that age they're pretty much a really cute shark on four legs

As with kids...you can't buy nice furniture.
I, too, want a 3.5 month old piranha.
Your raft is going to be nibbled down soon.  
Piranha there will get you eventually.
As cute as that pup is, I kinda wanted to see what a cute piranha would look like.
In my family we call that species a carpet shark
We also recently acquired a chomper.
I have a year old collie who did almost exactly this and looked just like Mr Innocent there, yesterday. Except picture it being the corner of my nice old end table.
My brother: That's a cat
*Furanha
Those are some seriously sharp teeth
Thats not a piranha thats a chinchilla. Cant you people see?
Ah yes... mine was a velociraptor for a time.

Look on the bright side he or she will have lovely teeth, which we can already see. Will save on dental chews just chop a couple tree trunks down
Piranha will thrive better if you add water. Piranha will also grow. But only if this is a water piranha. It‚Äôs hard to tell from the picture but water piranhas are commonly mistaken for land piranhas. If this is a land piranha, do not add water. Just supply a bowl of water for the land piranha and that will do.
Uh, that is ClEarLy not a PIranHa.
what a precious little baby! I think the folks over at /r/cromch would like this
"Look, mom, I'm a termite!"
Rip your furniture. F in the chat
Good boi noms table
Get that doggy some antlers, stat.
Ooooh little tiny sharp lab puppy teeth. It's a fun time. I remember when we first got ours my dad put hot sauce on stuff he didn't want the dog to nibble on. Only thing is he ended up liking hot sauce - naturally he was part of an Indian family now. So we got some bitter lime spray and he hated it. 
You're up for a lifetime of fun an adventure. I do hope you share more along the way.

Such a cutie!
I dunno kinda looks like a bull shark.
Wtf he's so cute

I can piratically hear Weird Al singing this to My Sharona
I had a black lab growing up and during her first year she chewed a 6-7 foot tall young maple tree down to a stump, and would still gnaw on the stump when she felt like it. So, good luck.
r/properanimalnames
Probably like chewing on a pencil.
Damn. It really looks like a doggie
I‚Äôll take what I can get
Pro tip to save your shoes and furniture: give him plenty of ice blocks to chew. You can also make a large ice block using an empty Tupperware. Bonus points for putting treats/kibbles in for them to enjoy.
I ‚ô•Ô∏è him/her
He has cute killer teeth

Careful. Too much love and affection could make them nibble on you to show affection. The sad part tho is that its worth it.
he can chomp on all my furniture
My pittie who is 11 now was a total piranha when he was a puppy. An expensive one at that. Chewed up an Xbox 360 controller, HD DVD player remote, when those were a thing, he ripped up my parents sprinkler system one head at a time, and ripped the drain from the AC unit out of the wall, which caused water damage to the floor and walls inside. Thank goodness he grew out of that. Shit was getting expensive. Keep lots of chew toys around!

Vinegar or hot sauce rubbed on the edge helps keep from chewing.
Is this in 3D?
