I got the following text from here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkS78RCAEeg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkS78RCAEeg)

"Australian farmer Isaac Martlew rescued a baby ringtail possum from a  bushfire-ravaged area of Kangaroo Island, as seen in social media  footage posted, Saturday, January 18.

"Martlew found the animal shivering from the cold under a tree on his  property.

"Martlew looked after the possum for two nights and then gave it to his  friends who were able to better take care of the animal. (REUTERS)"
I love our human biological tendency to adore all babies no matter the species.
Put him in your shirt so he‚Äôll feel like he‚Äôs still with mama.
I found one while out horseriding.  It was completely hairless and freezing cold the mother was dead from being hit by a car, so I tucked it in my bra to warm it while I rode home, it was a bit of a ride & was starting to move around as it warmed up, I kept it in there as I headed out to the vets.  Who was kind of shocked when I walked in apparently possumless then whipped it out the bra.  The little guy survived & was slowly released back into the bushland around us.  Coming back every night for months before it started coming back with a friend & then vanishing so I like to think he went & started a family.
Any baby born after 100,000,000 bce just knows stay warm, snuggle, get pets, and drink milk.
Good luck lil fella.
Feel sorry for this little guy...still needs heat after being rescued from fire.
Wow! I've actually never even heard of a ringtail possum. They're so much cuter than North American possums! They have hair!
So apparently this is what Australian possums look like. They're actually adorable

So uh what the actual fuck happened to our American possums? Homeless meth addict lookin ass fuckers
Yeah, Possums are definitely more cute than Opossums. I just learned that Possums and Opossums are not the same. Came in looking like whoa that doesn't look like the nightmare fuel like Opossums do.
It is impossumble not to love that cutie pie
Remember:

Possum = Adorable Australian 

Opossum = Abominable American
It‚Äôs so cute! Give me a new appreciation for possums.
r/RealLifePokemon
He looks so vulnerable
Wow, such a small cute little chappie
Sleepy, it is nocturnal and just wants to go back to bed.
What do you do next? Keep it? Rehabilitation center?
Those paws! Precious little one
Omg that is so cute! Look at it's big widdle feets! But it looks so sad. Very glad to read that it's been turned over to people who can care for it.
Good to know!
Oh my goodness! Wow. Where are you in the world?
Sleepy, it is nocturnal and just wants to go back to bed.
Good to know!
Good to know!
They're so much cuter as babies
Omg that is so cute! Look at it's big widdle feets! But it looks so sad. Very glad to read that it's been turned over to people who can care for it.

Good to know!

Give some warm to the possum

and then just watch it blossom.

playing possum in the most adorable way.
u/megansandwich LOOK
i want!! if you feed him/her luke warm milk with a little honey using a syringe she should grow and be okay. also later on she can eat mushed bananas. they need to be potted. so okay this sounds weird but their mothers usually lick their butts to make them wee so you have to simulate that and use a little bit of toilet paper and she will poop/pee. i used to have baby possums in the past and they all grew up happy and healthy :3 they make some great pets but they do tend to run up the curtains at alarming speeds! good luck whatever you decide to do with you‚Äôre little friend!

also you can keep them in your pocket if you want when they are little to keep them warm. or i usually get a hot water bottle and (not so hot tho) put the baby possum in a beanie hat ontop to simulate the pouch and she will be comfortable. and you can cuddle the beanie hat to keep her warm too. or place the hat on a low heat electric blanket.
I would like to know, if he also likes to move it
HE'S SO CUTE AND FLUFFY I THINK IM GONNA DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!
Just to be clear. There is a difference between opossum and possum. Most people say possum when they mean opossum. In this context it actually is a possum which is a completely different animal
Hey Aussie friends. Marsupial Joey rescue basics here.    

Joey's can survive up to 3 days after their mother is deceased, and people checking bodies save a lot of babies.

[Here's a basic guide on checking marsupials for joeys](https://www.animalinfo.com.au/fact_sheets/view/15/29/202/total:1)  

Two more things I'll add:  
If the teat looks like it's been used (it'll be kinda big) but you see no Joey, check around where you found mum in case they're hiding nearby.  

Ideally, also keep a can of spray paint in your boot so you can mark the body so everyone else knows it's been checked.  

I'm not super experienced in this stuff, but as I live in a bush area i decided to learn a bit and be prepared in case this situation ever happens to me. And I'd encourage anyone else to do the same!
Easily the cutest thing ever
Hey mate, thanks for sharing my video it is very much appreciated.  ‚ò∫Ô∏è
If anyone would like to check out everything else that's happened my Instagram is
@stornoway_fires
it's like a tadpole for possums
Get him a mini space heater :)
This is the cutest, most wholesome, f‚Äôin thing I have ever seen in my life.....
That‚Äôs the weirdest rat/cat/dog hybrid I‚Äôve ever seen
I thought it was a teeny tiny deformed german shepherd pup at first
OMG!! Thank goodness for people like you!!!
Wow it looks like a cute little puppy! But I sure wouldn‚Äôt  say that about a possum. It just goes to show that babies of most anything are cute.
I can't handle this. ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
This is so cute.I absolutely loved it.
I hope the baby is safe
I didn't know possums came in "adorable" flavor.
Rescued from what?
This is the definition of precious.
Cutee
I don't trust marsupials. In an Emu war I'm not sure they would join mammals in the struggle. I'm conflicted on this because they're so cute.
Oh my fucking God
The cutiest.
Precious
Thank you for sharing
Omg I've never seen a baby possum before. They're so cute :3
Ur Australian right?
Much cuter than our USA southern possums
Look at the size of those hind legs
How is this not a Pokemon?
This made my day
That‚Äôs a possum??? Holy fuck that‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
For some reason I read that as ring tailed sloth and was like waaat.
What a sweet little thing! Lovely of you to save it.
Opossum's are the new man's best friend.
Ossum!!!
Wow. If possums just stayed like that they‚Äôd be universally loved.
Pet. That. Possum.
That is basically a pok√©mon
Why can‚Äôt all opossums look like that!
THOSE FUZZY FEET! (Yes,  I am yelling.)
I need you to UPS me that asap!
Australia got the cute Opossums. The US has giant rats that had sex with Satan.
Possums have a bad rap. They don't carry rabies, and they typically don't mess with humans. I don't know why we hate them so much.
So cute! And the tail!!
Jesus.. Could I have clicked a more adorable post. Awesome! This shit helps me dispise humans less :D
I've seen cute things but this beats it all
Ong the paws
That is a startling amount of difference in cuteness from a full grown one.  
  
Edit: nvm was thinking of an american possum. Even full grown they are cute
Omg so adorable
Oh my God, its little feet!! It's so freaking cuteeee.
Hey this one doesn't look like a crack rat.
Warming up a juicy snack
This is the cutest little possum I've ever seen. I love possums c:
Big heart
You DEFINITELY caught something
Awwww..  I want a cute weird pet too.
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying.
Aww. üòç
How dangerous are possum? I thought their bites  spread flesh eating disease or something.
That is the most adorable of things
Great. Now I want one.
Fuck me
The real question is, are you going to try and keep it?
I love how people do this it just warms my heart
Nice
That's the cutest thing I ever seen.
OMG!  Look at his wittle paws.  Gotdamn this is adorable.
Looks like a small dog with a LONG tail üòÄ
Yeah I never bother the opossum on my land that I see. They eat ticks naturally on their own so they are cool with me and my dog ;) There's a skunk that lives near me and i hate that bastage though! He sprays everything as soon as it gets dark he's on his route looking to mark stuff LOL. I don't want him to spray my dog!!
i want one
My heart, no, stop
üòçüòçüòç
So cute ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
This wins the cute animal baby contest.
awwwww!
So nice, more photo!!!
Can you keep it?
u/Gintoki-desu omg look at HIM
STAAAAHP!!
Cuteness is killing me
How cute
This is how coronavirus starts
I hope you find someone who nudges you affectionately just like that baby possum is nudging that human‚Äôs palm!
My heart
Its little paws! The cuteness is too much!
Aaawwwwww
Well, I guess I know what I‚Äôm felting next.
holy shit that thing is cute. Fucking shit. FUCK YOU SHIT.  
asshole
So cute
apparently ringtail possums eat their poop while they're resting
why did i read it as baby potassium
I like that people still care about animals.
Well that's adorbs. The possums here in the states look like cat sized rats
"Who's your favorite possum?!"
Why is THIS possum cute?
Now that looks adorable...normal possums look nasty, or just plain mean, I guess.

This is cute
There was actually a study done as to why humans are more likely to foster baby animals. Deep in our striatum (decision making area of brain) we are hardwired to protect our young and somewhere along the line things got crossed. The study began in 1998 when The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.
Don't let the Chinese see it
They‚Äôre usually so damn ugly.... but all o can do is say awww so cute!! ü•∞
Pretty sure it‚Äôs not trying to warm up. If anything, the AC would be cranked!
Ok now I want a possum.......
‚ù§
I would literally die of sheer joy if I got to be this person's hand holding that possum.
Aaaaaaawwwwwwwww toooo cuuteeüò©
/r/tinyanimalsonfingers
poor little thing, when your last choice is to trust a huge hairless monkey
Cute factor is through the freakin' roof.
Looks like the little guy from Flight of the Navigator.
PEETS
Those paws ü•∫
Oh my heart... ‚ù§
Omg.  What a little cutie!!
So adorableü•∫
was cute until the tail.. ew reminds me of sewer rats :S
That is far cuter than any possum has the right to be üò≠
Second the awww, where is this does anybody know? Oops I see there‚Äôs a video, asked too soon.
Are they soft
My inner demon is shivering in adorableness.
That Pok√©mon is cute as hell
Keep it and love it forever
Ugh unfortunately if I found that thing I‚Äôd probably raise it as my own, to adulthood, and then I‚Äôd just have this giant adult possum living in my house.
Got the little buggers nesting in trees out front. Bloody loud when they run across the roof and launch into the trees in the middle of the night.
Omg that's so cute
All this makes me wonder is what did the American opossum do 2 piss God off so much that they made it so ugly
Can I haz it pls
I'm sorry, but that is a tiny dog.
A mouse with cat paws!
Awwww, so cute‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Heat, drought, fire , floods , cold     Things are moving faster and faster in OZ.
You know that feeling where something is so cute that it instantly manifests on your face? Just had that happen.
üòçmy heart just melted.
My dachshund does that in my armpit in bed.
I found an abandoned baby fox squirrel that I would guess was around this age. Raising wild animals is no joke and it made me understand why every website tells you not to do it. Had him about a half a year before he found a girlfriend outside and moved away. But not before he chewed on every piece of wood and took stinky-ass pees on everything. Not to mention waking up every four hours at night to feed him puppy formula with a syringe for a couple weeks. Oh, and all the scratches from their nails as they climb all over you at will.

Cute tho. Glad to see it's got a chance at a life.
I love it when cars have that new possum smell.
Watching things like this makes me want to love humans again, makes me want to have hope again, makes me proud that I am living person. Thank you Mr. Australian farmer. And thank you reddit.
IT‚ÄôS SOOOO FUCKING CUUUUUUUUUUTTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç

This is a prime example of it was cuter as a child
I love how its tail wraps around the person's wrist ü§©
oh my heart i want to love him
Ok this is the cutest thing I‚Äôll see this week.
Absolutely precious.
My heart melted
US here, I envy how cute you guys opossums are. Ours look straight up cringe. Like an aunt who's smoked since birth.
We will trade you possum species. Sincerely, America.
Cutest thing i have ever seen in my life
that thing is friggin' cute.
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Just don't eat it, no need for another epidemic..

/s
American here; does that absurdly long tail serve a function? After looking up pictures of the adults it doesn‚Äôt look like it could hold its body weight with it, but they don‚Äôt seem very flicky like a cat or dogs tail would be either. Is it just a evolutionary left over?
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for it
What a cute marsupial pupper! So happy it‚Äôs warm now.
Possums here in the US are HIDEOUS.
NAME THAT POKEMON!

For real though, very cute animal.  Nice job with the rescue.
What a sweet baby!!!
it's super cute
Im going to need you to hold still like this for next 8 hrs
He‚Äôs adorable!
A purple crown royal bag would be a nice pouch for him.
Ringtail possum are so much cooler looking than Virginia opossum.
Australia hasn't woken up yet, but [Grandma Poss](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/977817.Possum_Magic) would like to remind you that **Possum Magic is real.**
Be careful he could be playing possum
Poor thing üò≠ 
So cuteeeeeeee
‚ù§Ô∏è
i‚Äôll take 3 of them please
I never knew that I wanted a baby ringtail possum of my own, but I'll content myself with watching this gif.
Is that one of them pokemans?
Aww it's still alive, some subhuman Chinese garbage would dip it in soy and suck it down as it is and discover a new virus.
What was I thinking? Coming on to this sub and expect to not feel somthing inside my cold heart...thanks you beautiful ass whips
Look at its little feet! They're too fluffy for its body, like it's wearing booties.
I read the rescued part as recycled... oops
That‚Äôs a really cute baby bear cat rat dog
Umm,  is no one gonna mention those lol grabbies.
And according to Wikipedia, this cutie-pie "... consumes a special type of faeces."

[Caecotrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecotrope). TIL.
Naw! Grandma Poss protecting Hush
Dirty little hamster
Opossum, ring tail possum, why the difference in spelling? It‚Äôs correct, just curious
Such a cute little guy
Just look at him... üíï
I'm glad some people have good hearts
How are they so cute as babies and so terrifying when full grown?
LOOK AT DA PAWS THEY‚ÄôRE SO AW
I would watch a movie with this little critter as lead or sidekick. I don't really mind.
How come North America got the ugly ones :\
So adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è
At least the possum is better
Lil Bebe omg
If it‚Äôs in Australia isn‚Äôt already warmed up
Your supposed to put it in a pokeball.
good for you
Sleepy baby.
This is way too adorable. I hope he is doing good.
Rescued? I read a story about people rescuing animals but the animals don't really need rescuing. I'm not saying that's what happened here, but I did see any backstory.
Looks like a pocket sized wolf
More like warms my heart
What kind of feral parasites does this man have now?
oh my god! my heart
Car heaters won‚Äôt warm you up, it‚Äôs just circulated air passing through the vents. Try a blanket instead.
There is no baby more deserving of love and protection and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.
Wonderful. Thank you, whoever you are! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Cute smol floofy boi
That's is so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Ohh shii it‚Äôs a rat

The bots must have moved on, no more faux concern about arsonists.
Is so cute!!!
O-possum or possum 

The struggle continues
American possums are so ugly compared to this.
Awww
Looks a lot different from the baby opossums we have in Texas.
I think it's dead. Oh, never mind, it moved. No, I think it's dead again... Oh, nope, just playing possum.
Ah, so this is what it feels like to experience "cuteness aggression."
PAW PAW!
Why are Austraiian possums adorable and American ones horrifying?
Soooo cute üòæ
r/ntbdbiwdfta would love this.
Possums sure are less terrifying in Australia...
Oh god, he is so cute!

I will love him and hug him and hold him and call him George!
Well now I'm sobbing thanks
I love how cute this is
Those chubby little paws.
Ohhhhh my gawsh! I want to kiss it.
Good on ya. Also, Subaru Forester, amirite?
Rat like muzzle and tail plus puppy legs üòçüòçüòç
They're SO much cuter than the ones we have here in the States. THANK YOU to the rescuers!
Heart-warming.

Wow, your possums aren't hideous hell beasts like ours are.
Thought it was a üêÅrat
Who keeps scrolling up in an attempt to keep the focus on the baby?

That‚Äôs freaking adorable!
Never knew I could need to experience an animal cuddle so viscerally.
Awww!!
You get that feeling near your chest and it hurts a little but it‚Äôs the kind of pain that you like.
What I would give to experience that little bundle of joy in MY hand...so lucky both of them ultimately...
Aww
I'll have 12!
Quite pettin' me, I'm tryin' to snuggle an' sleep.
I‚Äôd keep him
Too bad they don't stay that cute. Maybe we could breed them like dogs to be chill and cute.
So adorbs!
awww
That is about the sweetest thing in the whole world
Awww hes so tiny
That is cute af man, hits the feelsüò≠
Think it‚Äôs going to grow into that tail?
Poor little beasty. I hope it recovers well and lives happily.
Awe! Careful it doesn‚Äôt bite or scratch you as wildlife will have to be put down if it bites or scratches you because they will need to test it for rabies. Also if you get bit or scratched immediately go get a rabies vaccine within 24hrs as after a certain amount of time it is too late to save you. Get the baby vaccinated before releasing.
Ahhhh ü§ó look at those little feets! Ugh my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
u/vredditdownloader
I feel cute and pity when looking at it....
LSAT question
I've only ever had brushtails, but I'd love a ring! They are so awesome!
That's a mini puppy with a tail extension
It looks like a tiny Wolff awwwwwww
So cute now. So ugly later
Didn't know they looks like tuny dogs with long tails
MY HEARTTTT
I would exchange currency to feel this lil guy snuggle up in my palm and wrap his tail around my wrist and do a big hekkin yawn.
It's cute until you got Coronavirus
Omg the little snuggles
FINALLY adorable content that isn't someones fucking cat.
Australian possums are waaaayyyy cuter then American ones.
Awww cute
You Sir/Madam..are a good doobie!
Not saying this is what the guy is doing just putting out information if any one has the same curiosity I did when I seen this. 

Unfortunately it's not good for them to be tamed and raised their whole life. Rhey dont do well in captivity. You however can obtain a wildlife rehabilitation permit and raise an opossum or several of the little guys until they are good enough on their own. Just help them get on their feet lol
I need this as a gif :(
Reddit has made me love possums.
Holy shit it‚Äôs like a Pokemon
This is it. This is the best thing.
I love them so much. One of my favorite mammal species.
NOTHING and I mean NOTHING has no business being that cute, smol, adorable, and causing my frozen heart to melt
Its baby pawpaw
Little guy looks like the creature from flight of the navigator but with a tail.
What the hell! It's so cute it looks fake!
He curls up same way I do when cold.
It looks like a German Shepard monkey pup adorable.
So cute even my husband, who strongly dislikes opossum, had to admit it.
Don't these grow up to be kinda far from cute?
Never thought I would fall in love with a possum.
Why does every possum I see have to be the crazy eyed shark teeth kind
This is way too cute to be legal
A lot cuter than the desiccated skullface de-cloaked Jawas we call possums here.
If it grows up to look anything like the possum's with white faces, that shit is a waiting monstrosity
The baby is sooooooo cute
Possum is Latin means "we are able" or "we are willing". Probably just a coincidence but I wanted to say it
Don't call my babe a ring tail possum , or I'll  cross-hair your paternal possibilities .
This is one of the cutest things I've ever seen. üòç

It's a real life pokemon!
Aww
soo cute...
Made my morning
Super cuteeee!
I‚Äôm glad we collectively decided to drop the O
 Why does this person have one ?

Are they common to find and collect like Pokemon or is this a rescue?
AWW IT'S SO CUTE <3 Glad that farmer was there in time to rescue it
Good christ that's adorable.

Oh, an Aussie possum.  I wondered why he didn't look like either of my possums.  

I can never remember - are the Aussie ones 'opossum' or is that 'Merkan ones?
**He is very beautiful.**
I found that guy on instagram @stornoway_fires 
he has a new video where he is climbing on a tree to rescue a koala üò±
Hope this little one will be okayüòä
I want a possum
That's no possum! That there is a Mew! I knew Pok√©mon existed.
But do he scream at own ass?
This is such a random thread!
Have not heard of a ringtail possum before, and now I love them.  Hope little one gets to be a wild cutie again.   The fires break my heart.
I want
The cuteness of this baby makes me hurt. I just want to smoother him kisses.
The proportions on this little lad seem... Perfect for maximum cuddle
aww, so tiny!
Aww! Small hand-pupper!
Possums are cute, not like our American counterparts, opossums.  They startle me, with their naked tails and the way they just pop out of nowhere.
Fucker's wrapping his tail around the guy's wrist.

Nice.
So I was drivin to lunch with my fiance when I noticed an opossum that was hit by a car struggling in the road and lying in a puddle of ice water. I pulled over and grabbed a blanket and box from my car and ran back down the road. I picked it up by the scruff with the blanket desperate to save it.

Unfortunately he had lost an eye and appeared to have broken his jaw and have, I think, a hernia. In the end there was nothing we could do for him other than end his suffering. An awesome vet nearby agreed to put him down. So my fiance and I drove the poor thing there.

Post mordum we named him Gus.
What a lovely creature. Very nutritious.
Bring it to me please
He will grow up into a beatiful, budding [cocaine monster.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/11387170-3x2-940x627.jpg)
I think it's dead
Are possums pests?
They r so cute as babys, but look at wat they grow into. Ick
Damn that thing is ugly.
Possums are really cute when theyre not eating your food and infecting you with rabies
