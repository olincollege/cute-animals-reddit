It's even making a silly face.
How do you know its on purpose?
A cat did it.
Why are they photobombing the cat?
Whew! Thanks God a cat was there to save this photo.
Ewwww guys! *makes retching noises*
It’s Bill The Cat!
WAZZUPPPPPPPP
That’s an  80s cat letting you know kissing is grody to the max!
Get a room guys. Yuuuk.

Either I'm completely blind or it's yet another Photoshop where someone forgot to or didn't know how to add whiskers back on the trimmed side.
I hate when humans get in my photos.
So great, I love cats, I have six now
This is my friemd, a photoshopped pic
Purrfect photobomb
Definitely photoshopped
Oof that's a bad photoshop... to the front page you go!
No. It doesn't. This is remarkably simple Photoshop. Amateur hour.
"true love... yeah, right...Flarpglargh, yucky, so Grosssss!"

Hobbes?! Is your name calvin?
I just got reddit and tried looking for a like button to upvote this
This is so cute!
That cat is all of us at 7 years old.
This cat is savage
No. It doesn’t.
This looks like a 90s album cover
I think the title is supposed to be "The perfect photo bomb doesn't exi...."
Just stay out of the background next time
"Ew! Yuck!  They’re kissing!"
Step 1) Photoshop a cat on a picture,
Step 2) Call it a photo bomb,
Step 3) Watch the sheeple eat it up
Well, MEOW
Ya the couple in the back really photo bombed the picture
B L E P
A goat could do it with this guy
I love it.
A surprise, to be in F1.
i dont think this is real
"Humans have the most disgusting habits. Pressing their mouths up against each other? If they want to show affection, they should clean each others' hair by licking it, that's what civilized creatures do!"
I know how he must fill little buddy. Someone that you know, who takes care you and then a stranger comes between you... “YUK!”
I have the same reaction when I see couples in public...
Cute little bugger!
Nice
Talk about a healthy sense of self esteem and sense of humor on that cat!  At least in that photo!
Lmao
Wanted to know what that lens tasted like.
"this photo will be so romantic.." 


😛

I know kitty, they are disgusting animals sometimes.
The couple doesn't seem to be centered in the pic initially.
BLEH!
🙀
r/blep
I've signed up to post this tomorrow.
Cat is a paid actor
When the cat knows they are both cheating. Lol
Schrodinger's photobomb.
"I wanna be in the photo!"
Priceless, a must save and share,lol! This is one of those things that not sharing is tantamount to 'cybernetic sin', lol! Too good to be kept just for oneself!:-)
Cool.
Kids when parents kiss be like:
A purrrrfect photo bomb
If you're gay, you know
I think the picture would be better if  the cat was a kitten waking up from a nap.
I hope the name of the cat is Calvin.
Kitty says, *Yech. I hate mushy stuff.*
garfield_irl
The meme is supposed to be “the perfect photo bomb doesn’t exi...”
Bill the Cat.

100% \*ack\*

Edit: ack
Truly fantastic
Mleh
Haha I love that photo
Brilliant!!!
I’d very much like to print this picture, frame it and hang it on the wall of my home. It’s perfect. Lol
😅
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
🤣
This reminds of Rudyard Kipling's  'The cat that walked by himself'.
That just typifies a cats relationship with humans.
The cat is hiding the wrong booty.

Sooo... Not perfect!
most cutest photobomb ever <3
Nimrod is pleased.
Lenny exists, so no he wasn’t crushed

I can count the pixels

Looks like Ari Shaffir.
My god that is amazing.
Wat on the other side of that cat

Ok so when someone put a funny cat picture on r/aww they stays but when I put a funny cat thing i get removed.
So the cat is still blurry and out of focus despite it being far away enough to gain focus, which means that it probably just walked into frame just to do that.
Him: How about we kiss right here?

Her: Alright.

Him and her *starts kissing*

Cat: Hey what's going o- oh.my.GOD
you guys are disgusting😾
AAAAAWWWWWAAWWWWAWWWAFREDGH HHTHTTRHKRACTSWQAAWEESAAAAAAAAAA
r/animalsbeingderps
I sure hope your framing that.
Sometimes cats/dogs will eat grass to help with treating intestinal worms, improving  their digestive system and fulfilling some unmet nutritional needs they also need grass for fiber. So that's why some pet stores sell grass so it's a lot easier for your perfect twin to fall from their butts.
Ginger is seconds away from cat paradise. Notice the snare around neck cutting off oxygen?
Cat be like: Destruction 100
Very rude of the couple to just plant themselves right in the middle of the cat's selfie like that.
This is hilarious and adorable!
The cat looks like it's genuinely disgusted by what's happening
This is amazing. I look forward to the memes it will generate.
if only it was focused
POV indicates a mouse was taking the photo, so kinda all makes sense.
Blep
How did you escape that with your life!?
"This outta show them" ... The cat thinks to himself
That giant bleeep 😻😻😹😹
Sure that couple is cute, but did you really need to photobomb a cat? :/
Why is there a couple trying to photo bomb a cat? 🤣🤣
This would be my wedding photo, blown up to fit over the fireplace!! This is awesome!
The cat looks disgusted.
Absolutely hilarious!!! 10/10
except it was photoshopped from two different photos👀
That cat sticking its tongue out right at the camera, its smarter than any of us
I love how cats are evil
That's kind of like me when someone takes millions of Photos 😂😄.
What a moment
hahah
The cat is already tired of looking at those two kissing
Why is my head so full of filth, I only see this cat pulling an aheago face
Purrfect**
Priceless
This definitely deserves to be framed and hung up on the wall for all to see...
So rude of this couple to photo bomb the cat trying to take a selfie.
Cat sharing its opinion about kissing.
I love his expression..
This is actually a frame from a video.
That tounge though!
Damn. That's a catastrophe.
Uh oh!
The emoji textbombed the title .
Wait a minute she looks a lot like my ex
[deleted]
The face my kid makes when I kiss my husband
My brother in law hid in a family picture of his mom and dad, I believe. He was so well hidden no one noticed it till decades later.
