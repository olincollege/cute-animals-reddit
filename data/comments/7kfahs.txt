What brand is this dog.

Edit:breed 
Each time I brought home my 3 newborn sons a couple years apart, my big, tough and rough beast of a Rottweiler would sit next to the baby for weeks just standing guard and staring, alerting us with each noise or movement. He was normally very obedient, but when baby toes were in the house, no matter what we did, he could not resist incessantly licking those toes when we weren‚Äôt looking. He looked so guilty but couldn‚Äôt stop himself. We finally gave up and the babies loved it. 
He died 4 years ago and I still cry sometimes missing him so much.
I don't know who's tomato this is but it's cute and I want it.
*Just what I always wanted. My own little human! I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him...*
man that is so sweet. dogs get it: tiny, vulnerable, i will be gentle and help you protect it, promise!!!!
Dog got a little stressed out just for not looking at the baby for a quick second. I fear great separation anxiety when this one leaves to elementary school üòÇ 
I think most dogs are super aware of what the deal with human pups is right away. I've read threads before about expecting moms who swear their dogs could tell they were pregnant even before they took a test. I like to think this doggo already knew and was waiting/ excited to see the brand new human.

We had a husky when my eldest was born. She really loved pears, we gave her one a few days after bringing the baby home and instead of her usual manic devouring of the pear she gently placed it under the basket where my daughter was taking a nap. 
I wonder what dogs think of the new baby scent.  To them, I imagine it being something like this:

 Owner 1 scent + Owner 2 scent = New Baby scent?  MUST LOVE NEW BABY IT SMELLS LIKE TWO OWNERS IN ONE!
"*MY* baby!"
I love my dog a lot, he's a pitbull terrier, except I feel like he's too much of an animal to be allowed so close to a baby. I just have trust issues.
"this thing is gonna drop *SO MUCH* food for me over the next couple of years..."
"Human small, I protect."
Oh! That is so so so sweet. I  hope my 3 cats fall in love with my lil boy. Find out in 11 weeks!

This is the thing to do with dogs.  Don't leave them unsupervised with a baby but make them feel loved and welcomed and that nothing has changed for them except that noisy creature you brought home. 

I feel that most dogs in a good, happy, safe home are quite happy to allow new members into their family as long as they are not suddenly made to feel like second class citizens in their own homes.  Dogs, I think, need to be treated very much like older siblings when a baby comes home.  Mommy and Daddy still love you very much and you are a good boy :)
This makes me so happy and sad at the same time.

My wife and I had the same moment with our twins and dog, she loved them and was always around for playtime and to be a pillow for them to sleep on, she would give them kisses when they cried and watch over them while they slept.

But unfortunately as she aged the vets believe she got severe early onset dementia or Alzheimer's, she began acting erractic and bit both of my twins so bad we had to take them to the hospital and because of this we had to put her down but when I went to see her at the vet after the rabies tests were done on the day we were to put her to sleep she was her normal self, happy to see me and jumping and I help her close is my arms as she licked me one last time and I cried into her as she stuck her tongue out when she fell asleep for the last time.

I miss my dog and these moments and I'm sorry if this comment isnt meant for here but I miss her and I just wanted to talk about her one more time and tell people that she was a good girl.

Edit to my comment: My apologise for just putting a sad story and not following up with some positivity!

Also to follow up, she was in quarantine for 7 days, which I thought meant they were running tests, I guess they removed her brain after she was put to sleep. My apologies for not making that clearer.

As for happy, she used to go into my boys rooms at 8 am every day and sniff their feet until they woke up, it got to the point where they started getting up and waiting for her. She would also just follow then around while they scooted around on their little 4 wheel baby scooters and chase them down, when they would stop and turn around she would look at them and then run away and wait for them to chase her.
You gonna finish that or...?
I‚Äôll be a downer too, but it seems like this dog is a bit anxious. Whale eye, little tongue flicks, all signs of anxiety. That being said, hopefully it‚Äôs just that these parents know their dog better than anybody and I‚Äôm wrong. :) 

It took my pup a little while to completely be comfortable with my baby around and we made sure to have only supervised, positive interactions/associations between the two. Two years in, they‚Äôre total bros now (and still always supervised). 
Funny. My parents always told me when I was a wee baby that I could never be left alone with our husky because he would try and drag me around and nibble on me like a chew toy. As soon as I got bigger than him though he seemed to learn his place and we got along famously. 
Hmm or maybe jealous of baby and just getting as close to possible to the owner. 
Idk dog looks kind of stressed/nervous - lip lick, whale eye, side glance, ear tuck... 

Probably going to be downvoted to oblivion because baby + dog how could someone say no?! But here‚Äôs a link that has some of the behaviors summed up https://positively.com/dog-training/understanding-dogs/canine-body-language/ 

I‚Äôm not saying baby and dog is world shattering bad btw, just that it‚Äôs not as ‚Äúaww adorable look how happy the doggie is‚Äù as we anthropomorphize it to be 

I don't care who your dog is, this is fucking stupid.

[deleted]
Aren't you worried the dog will bite the babys face or something? this just seems dangerous to me
[reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTaEJMKc7Lw)
This dog is showing quite a few stress signals here. Doesn't necessarily mean impending doom, but if I was that mother I would be more cautious in the future with letting the dog that close. 
1) the ears are pinned back, doesn't necessarily indicate fear, sometimes from excitement. Similiar to tail wagging. 
2) lots of lip licking. Appeasement signal to ward off potential threat. 
3) the dog makes "whale eyes", they are bulging a bit, then he looks away breaking eye contact. Maybe from a distraction hard to say.

That dog is definitely uneasy and nervous. :( not really a good spot to be in for the dog or baby. I'm not saying this dog is a "baby killer" from a 5 second gif. But he doesn't seem comfortable with it. It's a pretty good example of how we tend to personify dogs, and don't realize they have body language that is very different from our own. 
Never leave a new baby alone with a dog.  Tragedy can and does strike suddenly.
Yeah
... That's really not what that dogs doing....it's showing anxiety and jealousy. It's trying to get as close to the mom as possible.
I am wolf dog. I will eat this tiny human later tonight.
she must be hungry
Either that or she's just really jealous.
I'm all for dogs, babies, and upvotes but there's been instances where dogs attack newborns. 
This is just one of them. http://abc13.com/police-identify-8-week-old-baby-killed-by-family-dogs/2329045/

waiting for the downvotes to roll in

Hi, animal-noob here. I was wondering, how do we know one dog is perfectly safe to be so close to a baby (or our face) at a 99.9% probability?
[deleted]
[You shouldn't conduct the experiment using live subjects.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvnJmN_yehw)
Our overactive daschound/jack russel terrier mutt never showed any interest in mini humans...till we brought ours home. The dog would not leave our son alone, had to be a nearby when we were holding him. He would also become very concerned at any squeak or cry that our son made. He would run to the bassinet, check on our son, run to find us, then follow us back to make sure everything was alright.
This whole comment section is a great example of how the majority of humans tend to anthropomorphize animals. In reality, animal instincts are very different. It really just looks like the dog is investigating with smell and gauging it's position in the pack with this new member. It's even putting it's head on the baby, like, "okay, so I'm still above the baby in rank.. nobody does anything when I rest on top of it." 
Humans are terrible at reading dog body language. She‚Äôs licking her lips, ears back and wide eyes - she‚Äôs anxious and unhappy. The dog shouldn‚Äôt be put into this situation as clearly she is unsure how to act; this is not to insinuate she is going to harm the baby in any way - but she‚Äôs trying to tell you she‚Äôs uncomfortable. 
Every year some kid dies because an idiot parent thinks their pet is different and would never attack their kid 
I love dogs,  *love* them, but just please understand that they are still animals and they're unpredictable- my friends 5 month old kid was attacked by their dog last week when it had ZERO previous aggressive behavior and in fact is easily intimidated by their kitten. Totally unprovoked. 

We all love them. but they're still unpredictable. 
DANGER DANGER DANGER! That dog is not super relaxed and comfortable and is showing a lot of body language of stress and conflict. 
Or hungry 
This is sweet, but people keep forgetting that dogs are animals. One wrong movement, sound or alarm, the dog snaps and the baby is left severely disfigured or worse, regardless of weather or not the dog understands how "precious" it is 
To join the chorus of semi-negativity, I saw a gif that was on /r/funny titled something like ‚ÄúI think he was jealous,‚Äù where a dog owner was patting a stuffed dog in front of his real dog.  The actual dog sat there for a long while looking totally mellow until he just flipped out on the stuffed toy.  People in that thread were saying ‚ÄúOh yea my dog would be totally jealous,"  yet here I see ‚ÄúIt knows its a baby it totally wouldnt harm him.‚Äù

There‚Äôs a few other comments in this thread that mention the dog looks somewhat anxious or is looking to gain the adults affection, and I tend to agree.  Either way, even if I knew the temperament of my own dog, I would still never ever letting it that close to a newborn.
My baby cousin has a huge scar on her face from someone doing this with a dog. Cool. 
He just want to take a bite
My male husky knew when I was pregnant. He jumped up on everyone but stopped jumping on me once my belly was noticeable. He was also a loner but couldn‚Äôt sleep anywhere except under my babies‚Äô crib. He loved kids and the smaller the better. Very loving breed.
Dogs just get it. 
I feel like a curmudgeon when I say this, but I would never let a dog that close to a newborn like that, dogs got germs like everyone else and who knows if they'd paw at the baby as is their want
good boyo swer to protec smol hooman
one bite and its all over. 
Seams pretty dangerous to have dog so close to the head.
Eh. As much as I appreciate the moment, it would be very hard for me to let any animal that close for too long. The most loyal of pets make small mistakes and with a newborn, completely not worth the risk. I'd wait until they were much older before introducing them to an animal.
'My dog doesn't bite!'
this makes me anxious
Just remember, however adorable they are, never leave the baby and dog alone together
Wish dog lifespan was like 100 years.
Aww that's so sweet. Dogs are wonderful. <3
Dis hooman is gonna get more luv than me?

I is ok with it. Just save some luvs for me plz.
Everytime I see a dog this close to a little child I get so tense. You might know when a dog won't bite, but just because of an instinct, jealousy or whatever may happen, a bite would totally kill the kid...
Looks like the dog is about to take a bite lol
That baby‚Äôs in danger.  
Ears back, lip licking, looking away, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs love 
Is this normal cuz I usually hear story about dogs get jealousy of the new born baby and attack the baby
Why would you let a dog that close to a newborn baby?  Risks are high benefits low.
That's cute and all but I wouldn't let the dog be so close to the baby's face, tbh.  Animal lover but this made me nervous af. You never know with dogs, they could bite at it for a variety of reasons like one of their toys, etc.
This is not doggy love. That is dog asking what the hell is this. Is it food, is it play? Why r u showing over protection, human. This dog doesn't know what the baby is yet in the family's hierarchy.

Let the downvotes begin :D
Years of being best friends await
Never doing that. I love dogs but nope...
Are there ever incidents of dogs biting infants as small as this one?
This gives me the chills, I feel that the dog could bite the baby any moment.
While I understand that people find this sweet... This is r/aww ... I can't help but get worried when I see things like this. No matter how much you'd like to embellish it, it remains that newborns are exceptionally fragile, and dogs are animals, not humans. They are unpredictable. No matter how well trained or good natured, I couldn't ever place my trust in an animal in that kind of way. 

You only have to glance at a newspaper to see that tragedy *can* strike. Just my opinion. 
sister in laws husky but my niece in the face. I cringed when I saw OPs post.
I would never let a dog this close to a baby.
Ive said it before and Ill say it every time i see a post like this.


Dogs are animals, its not worth the chance of having a babies face bitten off for the sake of a fuckin "aww" moment. 

Jesus christ people, stop thinking you know what animals think. 
It's so sweet how she tries to be as gentle as possible around the baby.
I have a serious question. Human touch and any kind of germs around a new baby is super harmful, why do people let dogs around new borns or atleast like why this close? Is it not harmful?
My friends dog gives their newborn his toys to play fetch, while he‚Äôs sleeping. It‚Äôs the cutest thing. 

He‚Äôs gotta wait a few years for his future best bud to grow up first!
I'm totally not going to eat it when you walk away
That dog is clearly begging for dinner.   
This is 100% the case with my pittie [Zelda](https://imgur.com/a/UqFfT) and my son. 
*im just gonna put my nose right here okay*
The baby makes me want to downvote, the puppy makes me want to upvote. I guess I'll do nothing then. 
Seriously wtf did humans do to deserve dogs. 

I'm totally convinced that if an apocalypse happened the higher beings/religious icons  (what ever you believe in) will save all dogs and leave us.
One thing that a lot of people aren't quite addressing is that dogs have played a very important role of keeping watch over human children for a long time. There are even nanny dogs that have specifically been bred for this purpose. 
Imagine if it just bit right into the baby's skull. 
Now I want a baby and a dog.
I thought it was more of an ‚ÄúAre you gonna eat that‚Äù look
"Are you gonna eat that?" - Dog, probably. 
Do dogs know that babies are fragile creatures?
Dogs are so strange , mine is huge and could pull a large man off his feet , yet give him a rope toy and a kid and he will only pull enough so that it's fun , he knows just how much pressure to use when playing , the same when walking on a lead
'But, but, when do I eat it?' 
Yea.. that's not what's happening here...
For the safety of both the baby and your dog, stop doing this.
'What can I do to help?'
My doggo growled at anyone who would touch my wife's pregnant belly. She never growled towards anyone like that before.

Dogs know.
There's some good comments about dogs knowing and wanting to protect newborns. 

Also remember dogs can swing the otherway. Huskeys especially have been known to kill many small things and even attack younger children, even though they might seem to be the nicest dog in the world. We can only guess the dynamic that the dog thinks it's in (i.e the owners are the alpha). Not always the case. Just be cautious introducing new things to the pack.

Congratulations though. Super cute dog and baby!

Edit: typo
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
When she looks at the camera, I'm half convinced she's a porg
That‚Äôs her baby now. Supervised visits only. 
Do dogs have an understanding of other species offspring? I just think it's neat how some dogs will protect your children. And other animals will eat them immediately. 
Millie is such a sweet dodge
This human is too small, must observe for further growth 

Edit: Spelling, for I am dumb human
She's high on human!
That little munchkin tasted dog breath for the first time. You can see the reaction. They'll make great friends.
"got any games?"

"Welcome to the pack"
Doggos are too good for us
She looks so much like my puppy! 
It‚Äôs an evolutionary trait that babies of any species are cute. It is protection, although it doesn‚Äôt always work. I recently watched a documentary where a male lion came and killed a bunch of cubs from a different father. He wanted to mate with the mother so those cubs had to go.
We don't deserve dogs ! So precious...
I wonder if dogs smell or react to the oxytocin?
I thought it was an avocado in the thumbnail 
Animals are so fucking amazing
amazing
The baby is like "Hey brah, stop touching  me."
Germs though?
Really cute baby and I love your pet as well. Both look charming.
I rember reading that dogs literraly feel in love with their people. Just big balls of fur and love.
They'll be causing trouble together before you know it, congratulations & enjoy!
The look of tenderness in that dog is incredible.  And I don't mean it's meat you peckerwoods. 
WhY hE sO sMoL?
I'm in love with this gif.
My favorite thing to do with posts like this is sort by controversial and read all the comments that are like **"OMG THE DOG CAN EAT THE BABY"** 
A life long friendship is made 
How old is the doggy in this clip? I hope she‚Äôs young enough to have some good years left by the time this child is old enough to play with her. 
What have we done to deserve such magnificent creatures.. 
She‚Äôs very maternal towards the little baby
Well the mom would‚Äôve been exposed to the dog during pregnancy, so to an extent so would the baby. It‚Äôs not like the dog was rolling around in radioactive waste either. Whatever they‚Äôre exposed to, so are we as long as it‚Äôs our dog. 
You mean her new tiny human! Super sweet.
*I shall protect you for the rest of my life, human*
Fairy dogmother
At a glance I thought the baby's head was a ballsack.
This is the most precious thing I‚Äôve ever seen 
Kinda a rough day...then this...thank you needed it 
This is so adorable.  
The look on her face is beautiful.
Gettin in on that new bay bay smell. 
UH NO, 

she's concerned she's not gonna get  all of the attention!!!
Dogs are special animals
Great. Now I want a husky AND a baby.
Another reason why dogs are amazing 
She got that gentle and loving eyes looking at the baby.
Oh man that‚Äôs so incredibly sweet! I love it üòç 
my eyes are all misty andni dont knoe ehy brcause i thpught i deleted all my human emotions.
Oh my goodness my heart just melted üò≠ These two will have a great childhood together 
That is the cutest!!!!!
"Tiny human is mine too? Yeah, tiny human is mine too."
adorable
Dogs are too fucking pure for this earth. Im not a dog expert but I have to imagine that they know babies are the human equivalent of puppies and have the same reaction.
One of the sweetest things ever.
This is such a bittersweet memory for me. A few months ago we had to say goodbye to our sweet girl. When she met both of our kids she couldn‚Äôt contain her excitement. She adored them both and always was there with them. From the beginning. When I was pregnant she would hover over me and guard my belly. She would also walk me and turn around to circle around and then push me along gently as if to say ‚Äúcome on fatty, puppies aren‚Äôt an excuse to be slow on a WALK!‚Äù  
‚ÄúI will take care of this tiny human for the rest of my life.‚Äù
I'm a 28 year old guy and I get really emotional when I'm hungover. I need to stay hydrated not cry it all out thanks jackass
It has that *"new baby"* smell.
Thought the head was a ballsack for a solid 3 seconds
This is the definition of "awwww"
Even dogs love that new-baby smell.
"omg he smells like both of you, this is awesome!"
Or hungry.
We do not deserve dogs, but goddamn am I happy we have them
‚ÄúDamnit it still won‚Äôt pet me‚Äù
Oh this is so amazing!
Aww
Malamutes are the best!
She's a good girl..no doubt about it!
"We're gonna be the best of friends" 
More like... "This... thing... smells... WEIRD."
We have 10 month old dog and a 2 1/2 year old son.  I think it‚Äôs amazing the bond they have developed. It‚Äôs like she treats him like a puppy trying to herd him when he‚Äôs running around and keeps a watch when he‚Äôs in the sandbox along with other things I‚Äôve seen in nature shows. 
Smells like flowers
that dog looks hungry
This gif is everything
i love this a million times.
super cute, love dogs so much
That kid is going to have the best guard doggo
This is so beautiful. It made me tear up. 
Most beautiful thin I‚Äôve seen. This filled my heart with warmth. 
aww
My mom told me that female dog she had when I was born did the same thing, and that she would lay next to my crib constantly like she wanted to protect me. I remember her a little. 

My two dogs are impressively patient with my niece. My female would sneak behind her little chair when she couldn't yet walk just to touch her with the nose on the back of baby's head. Now when niece is two dog follows her everywhere. 

Yesterday niece got into cabinet where I keep treats for dogs. I walked in and catched her. She knew she wasn't supposed to open cabinets, so she stood there with a bag of treats and said "gonna give it to Bonia! (My dogs name according to my niece). So she did. I couldn't bring myself to be mad because I was laughing inside. Dog was in heaven tho.

Not every dog is great with kids and even when it is we should supervise them because they're animals and kids are kids, but they can go awesome together. 
Man, considering how nice babies smell to us, to dogs they must have the nicest smell in the world. 
My heart melted
protect mode, enabled.
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs...
He just met his best friend :)
Cute!
Dogs are so gentle
'I like dis pink puppy'
Sweet puppy

Dog: "Excuse me, but this is my baby now."
This may be the cutest thing I have seen all day.
I love the face dogs get around babies
What a good girl
Are dogs aware that human babies are delicate? She seems to be really gentle with the baby
Thank you for making my day a little bit better <3
I wonder how much they understand this is a new "pup" in the pack.
How PRECIOUS is this!!!!
For how long domesticated dogs have lived alongside humans, I'm sure they're probably instinctively aware of what baby humans are like, just as we are aware of them having puppies.
I just keep watching this. 
boy, this is heartbreaking. too bad that puppy must wait so long to play with his new born best friend. :)
cute 
She knows...

This is splendid
And thus a lifelong friendship is born.
The animal instinct for newborns kicks in.
*aww* so cute . . . üòò
She's like: Holy crap it's so small!!!!
For those reason sometime I prefer dogs to humans they are just so sweeeeet
Congrat for the baby also! :) 
He just loves that new human smell. 
Oh how I love this 
That baby is going to love dogs when it grows up
This is so precious
My husky is way too hyper to do that
My six month old mal puppy and my seven year old son are on a path to becoming best friends- I‚Äôm not sure they realize they‚Äôre not the same species :) Mals are very intelligent, and seven year old boys not so much so I‚Äôm pretty sure they‚Äôre evenly matched. It‚Äôs what I‚Äôve wanted for him since the day he was born- and we couldn‚Äôt be happier 
She wants to eat your baby
Ah yes, that new baby smell. Breath it in. 
Can...can I eat it?
My brother was worried about how his crazy, spoiled, not so perfectly trained, formerly pampered princess Fox Terrier would react when my nephew was born.  She loved him from day one and even "guarded" his room.  No jealousy whatsoever even though she got a lot less attention (maybe some relief in retrospect).

Use common sense and don't set up any situations that could end badly, but dogs have been with humans for a long time.
My Golden, who had previously not shown himself to have even one protective bone in his body, immediately took over as protector when I brought my newborn son home. That night, he positioned himself between me and the door to the nursery, facing the door, as if to say ‚ÄúIf you want to get to him, you gotta come through me first.‚Äù  
Dog is looking a wee bit stressed :/
Dogs and humans coevolved together. They recognize human emotions and facial expressions. Makes sense they cherish our offspring as well
What did humans do to deserve dogs?
Dogs are absolutely adorable. I'm glad to be an owner of a rescued doggo :)
Love it. My wife and I just got home from hospital today with our first child. Our three cats could care less. Looking into cats for dogs exchange programs
I expected the dog to lick the baby's face.
"The pack grows stronger" - Doggo 
Man I fucking love dogs! I mean there is no limit to their love, it is truly boundless
Congrats on your child, we just had ours last night! No doggo though :/
Nothing short of precious! Nothing. 
Such a cute pair... that baby‚Äôs entire head could fit in the dogs mouth lol
Doggie knows that babies are eventually food slot machines. Licked faces, licked floors, easy begging... yeah, that pup hit the lottery and knows it. 
I think that doggy sees a yummy morsel ready to eat. 
It‚Äôs called jealousy......morons
Dogs are compassionate and understanding. You are the leader of his/her pack, therefor he/she knows that the baby is a part too. A dog can only be as good as it's master.
"I-It's... a hooman pup. Hallo hooman pup."
Aww so beautiful, dogs are more protective when it comes on to babies they really understand what's going on smart.
Cute, probably fine, but has a small potential for unspeakable horrors. No thank you with my infants. 
It amazes me how dogs instinctively know how to treat and behave around human babies.
Hooman, tiny hooman 
Keep your big dogs away from babies idiots
"Are you gonna eat that?"
This is the most adorable thing ever. 
What type of dog is that? It‚Äôs beautiful
this is the cutest shit ive ever seen
When the dog looks at the camera they look so pure 
Thats a look of jealousy o.o 
Somehow you know that dog is going to love that little human for the rest of his/her life. What a nice moment to witness! My brovaries are glowing bright!!
Dogs truly are man's best friend. 
"I want to bury this in the backyard."
Always amazes me how well so many dogs do around babies and small kids of all kinds.

My dog plays rough with larger humans or who he sees as strong enough to play. Yet, he is so gentle with kids and calm. He doesn't jump on, push, lick or run around them. He will stay close, but doesn't lean on them, moves slowly and watches them. He was maybe 5 months old when he started displaying that. Dogs are truly amazing creatures.
[deleted]
The dog looks like it is sad that you only had a litter of one.
Wy u so smol?
god i love dogs 
She‚Äôs the best girl. 
Mmmm... Yum. Give it to me since you're not gonna eat it. 
My parents had a husky when I was born and my parents said that she was insanely protective of me. When I was learning to walk, she would run over and make sure I was ok when I fell down. One time when I was still a baby I was crying and my mom was frustrated because she couldn‚Äôt get me to calm down. She shouted at me from another room asking me what I wanted to stop crying. The dog went into my room to protect me and for the next few days wouldn‚Äôt let my mom be alone with me in the same room. The dog passed when I was like 3 or 4 and I have a memory or two of her always being near me. I think most dogs have a sixth sense for babies knowing they are essentially helpless and need protection. 
The cutest thing about this is that the dog would probably protect the baby with his/her life. The dog is completely aware if the fact that it‚Äôs a baby, and as it‚Äôs a baby in his/her pack, the dog will protect it.
"Wen the wurl attac, I protec! Promis!"
She‚Äôs hungry is what she is. 
‚ÄúThank you for giving me this gift, hooman‚Äù
Classic example of how dogs become family and you can see the look in the face of this dog that even though you had this baby we are going to raise this baby it‚Äôs my baby to...‚ù§Ô∏è
I love this dog more than I‚Äôve ever and will ever love another human being 
So sweet! 
I haven't commented in a post for years (I don't think), but I have to let you know this clip is AMAZING.  It brings a big smile to my face :)
Are dogs actually this smart? Do they recognize that this is an infant and you have to be delicate with them? 
She is protecting her future partner in crime. 
That is just the sweetest thing. Thanks for sharing. Brightened my day! 
No she's just hungry that's all
Humans did something very right when choosing dogs as our companion species.
And my dog just peed on my new L-couch üôÇ
I remember the day we bought each of our kids home and the immediacy with which the dog connected to them. Each time he was asleep next to their cot or basket right away, and he never left their side for his entire life. I miss my boy. 
Puppers make the best babysitters. No cash required. 
Babies smell WONDERFUL. 
So cute. Also having a dog in the household is the best thing you can do for a newborn‚Äôs immune system!
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs 
Dog looks at camera: " OMG it's so cute! I show him Trik. Hay budy, I'll lay my hed her, you lean in n boop the snoot"
Dog want to know how long until the tiny human can give ear scratches

milperthusky on Instagram! Both of their huskies are more needy than this human baby will ever be and I love it. 
Dogs sense of smell is 40 times greater than ours... imagine how intense that new baby smell is for the lucky pup! It is the greatest smell in the world.
IT'S A TINY LITTLE HAIRLESS PUPPER!
ITT: dozens of people who own dogs but don't understand even basic psychology...your dog thinks it is part of a 'pack', your newborn smells exactly like both you and your spouse, it smells familiar, it smells like the pack...not just the pack the alphas in the pack so you damn sure love and protect that
How healthy/hygenic is this for the baby?
My heart just exploded. This is the sweetest thing.
Thats going to be something Special, i can just see it

All that aside.

_Doggo must hecking P R O T E C C_
totes adorbs
The way the dog looks up at the human and almost seems to ask "is this ours? Is it really?! No way!"
A good dog is the purest creature

Babies just smell really good!
Blessed... all three of you.
my heart hurts
This melted my heart

Jealous of the dogs restraint to not lick! My heeler loves my 4 month old, but she can't resist the urge to lick him any time she's close enough to him!
I think this is my new favorite post of all time!
A bit off topic but the your shirt is so cool!!!!!
Gimme that husky.... NOW!
God I fucking love dogs
guardian 
Female dog?
Love at it's finest. 
Its probably the new baby smell. 
Holy Doge, that doge is fucking adorable I just wanna fucking give it a pet.
Credit where it's due, this is @milperthusky!
He will drop food on the floor so dog will be Happy.
Ummmmm....chicken.....

My mom told me to have my husband bring home a couple diapers from the hospital to let the dog sniff baby smells.  No problems with 3 kids. . 
The dog's name is Millie. The source instagram page this video is from (**milperthusky**) is full of *super* cute videos of her and her brother Rupert. 
What an interesting pink cub you have here
This is too sweet.

Our dog still isn't sure of the tiny human, and it's been 3 years! They just politely coexist. The cat, on the other hand, hates our son. Like, to the point where he sighs when the kid walks into the room...and yet, he still lets this child do whatever he wants to him! They'll lay on the floor together, my son smooshes his belly fat, grabs his feet and tail, gives him squeezes, the works, and the cat still puts up with all of it! As soon as there's a chance, though, he escapes to our room to hide from the tiny monster.

Now that I'm expecting again, the cat has started snuggling with my belly. Maybe in the hopes that he'll get a more gentle friend this time around...(fat chance, fatso).
This makes me wonder: how is it that dogs and cats can sometimes understand if not care greatly for an infant so much?
I TOO LIKE TINY HUMANS HA HA HA. error ()
I wish my dogs loved our baby. They are jealous and scared of her. They move away when she reaches out for them and try to push her over when she is in our laps. 
We don't deserve dogs.
Didn't this happen in one of the twilight movies?
This needs to be a feature length movie

"This hooman smells so goooooood"
That's her baby now
How can something be so scary and cute at the same time
Dogs are the best
Can anyone tell me which breed it is? A Malamute? Very lovely dog :>
Nah.  She just doesn't want you to forget who is the First Baby in the house.
Oh I love pets and babies! 
Lovely
"I love you humans, but that is the ugliest puppy I have ever seen. I mean it doesn't even have fur! And where is the rest of the litter?"
Why did i mistake the babies head for an oddly designed fleshlight for a second
my tired eyes have only seen a dog staring at a scrotum at first
[removed]
That‚Äôs the cutest shit I‚Äôve ever seen
I did the same thing with my two dogs, the female embrace her, the male was kinda jealous but now they are all good.
I have a feeling that this dog literally finds this baby "cute" in the EXACT way that humans find puppies "cute". 
What kind of pupper is that 
Big Al says dogs can‚Äôt look up 
"Can i eat it ?"
"We're going to be best friends, little human."
Insert appropriate Seinfeld joke.
I can already imagine all the adventures these two are gonna have...
The doggo is downloading the baby.exe content.
Oh my god this is one of the cutest things I have ever seen.
@milperthusky
we have had cats do this...
Smells like future funs
I always feel like bull terriers get a bad rap with children because occasionally some nutter who has brought their dog up to be pretty scary leaves them with a child and what everyone else could tell you was going to happen happens. 


My staffy Maxie was brilliant with children and everything she did was so soft and gentle where as she was really rough when playing with adults, god I miss her :(
I just realized that every dog who knows a baby from the start of its life will never really see that human completely grown up.
Kinda fucked.
I'll just leave [this article](https://news.sky.com/story/woman-mauled-to-death-by-own-dogs-in-grisly-attack-in-us-11175051) here.
Oh my gosh. 
You can just tell that dog is fighting the urge to give the baby face licks.
Cats are the same. They love the big, hairless, useless kittens.
What kind of species is this? A husky??
I wish our dog was like this. She's afraid of our new son, and won't even come within two feet of him. :(
That's really cute. Wonder what the husky is thinking.
Is this the title of Dr Hook's next song?
Oooooo mommy‚Äôs Butt Turkey !
I think that‚Äôs [my dog. ](https://i.imgur.com/3OId9qi.jpg) 
I read somewhere that the Eskimos used to let their Siberian Huskies watch over their little children when they went out to go hunt for food.  I own a Siberian Husky myself and when ever he is around babies he gets real passive, calm but you can tell hes protective.  Its real amazing how traits are on passed on in certain breeds.  Dogs are amazing animals.  pS:  anyone that thinks this dog would harm the baby doesn‚Äôt know jack about Siberian Huskies.  They are the most friendliest and gentle breed there is .  
She looks like one of the last Jedi furrbies. 


No spoilers. 
This just reminds me of how much I Love dogs and hate cats.
Kona
How do you know it's a girl?
I'm worried about our two dogs. They are pretty hyper in nature. Trying to figure out how we are going to introduce them when we have our baby in Feb.
üò¢ looks like my Khaleesi üò¢üò¢üò¢I miss her 
Isn't there a hormonal or chemical reason for this? 
I'm just here for the comments section, because after some of the comments on Facebook I need to balance the fucking scales. You've done well, Reddit.

Edit: forget it, I found them
My SIL mini schnauzer gave zero shits for the new baby.  8 months later, she growls whenever the baby wants to play.  I do feel sorry for the dog as she was neglected once the baby came home from the hospital.  Only time she gets attention is when she eats and needs to go outside to use the washroom.  
is this a husky? so cute :3
She‚Äôs a good dog Brent.
I‚ÄôM IN LOVE WITH THA COCO
What is the sex of either, the new human or the pup
Nice nails 
Huskies know.
Also super jealous haha. Wants to be exactly where the baby is, much like my mother's little daschund when my niece is around haha.
HUMANS SHALL NOT REPLACE US
That's damn Jacob is at it again
Girl dogs are always the best
I want one 
The dog looks like a Husky. They are loving, loyal, and lots of fun. 
I love Husky, she's like a big sister...
Adorable <3

AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I want to see more of dogs loving babies
Big dogs are so smart, people who haven't had one just don't understand and can criticize all they want, but you haven't met that dog and you don't know it's history. No parents would let an aggressive dog near their newborn. Relax.
ITT: Redditors suddenly become experts on dogs and how they act by googling. 
This reminds me a story of a dog killing a newborn with one bite 
"What happened here....you smel like my mom's belly from a few weeks ago..."
post of baby: EWW GROSS HAVE A DOWNVOTE

post of baby (with added pet): AWWWWW!
does dogs feel the same way about babies as we do about puppies? 
I can't even
Am I a psycho if I‚Äôm worrying about the dog biting this youngling all of a sudden? 
Babies are to dogs like puppies are to humans
If that were my wife she'd freak out. She nearly made me agree to have my dog be sent away several states over to live with my mom in fear of it harming our newborn through germs or otherwise. I knew she wasn't a dog person the day I met her, that did not feel like a deal breaker until that situation arose. She agreed we could keep him so long as I take him out on a lot more walks to keep him from getting dirty in the backyard. 
After my son was born, our cat was always at his side. He was just like the good doggo in this gif. 
I love this so hard
Doggo "I want one" 
It‚Äôs almost like he‚Äôs looks at the cameraman to say ‚ÄúAww, your human so cute.‚Äù
If there's any doubt that animals have the ability to be empathic and love deeply and immediately. Here's your answer. <3 

PS: Congratulations, OP. She is beautiful! The puppy too! Looks like she's got her own Guardian for Life. Good dog! <3
Thats why dogs are mans best friend.  Cats would get jelous that the baby is getting more attention and try to smother it.
This pupper knows they're no longer the baby of the family anymore. This pupper is also a very good pupper :3
ITT: People with pack animals in their household surprised about pack animal behavior - it takes a pack to raise a cub everyone.
I always think this but we really don't deserve dogs(cats are questionable). All they ever want is unconditional love and it's also all they ever want to give. It makes my heart hurt.
Be good to her, tiny human, for she will be your best friend until the end.  
Where was Rex when the teenager had her bedroom door locked with Vinny?
Was I the only one who thought this was a dog looking intently at a large red pepper for a moment?
My friend had to give up his husky as it kept snapping at his newborn. Odd how dogs can have such a different reaction to babies. 
As Biologist I must say this is awesome to keep your baby with a healthy inmune system thus preventing to adquire some threatening life allergies (like egg or seafood) many babies/kids get for extreme cleaning (I'm supposing your dog is vaccined and very clean of course).

"I bet it tastes good mmm"
Dog breath right into a newborn baby's face. Fantastic. *slow claps*
Isn't that the same breed of a dog that attacked the white puppy from the other gif?
This would be cute and all if it didn't send out several massive red flags about what not to do regarding baby and dog interaction.
Not safe keep dogs away from babies.

Oh yeah it's so healthy to let a germ monster like a dog put it's snout right on the newborn's face.

henlo smol hooman. i like you. üê∂
