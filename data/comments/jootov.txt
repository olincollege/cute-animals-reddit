The little boy waving is what did it for me lol. So sweet.
At 38 seconds she goes chonker mode
Sad-faced Police Officer: Dammit man, I'm on duty here.  Would you *please* turn that camera off so I can pet the dog without getting in trouble??
You and your pup helped to fix the world's karma level - well done!
I'm a grown man and I still wave to dogs like the kid on the subway.
Pre-covid times were so simple... now this is so shocking..
she's madmax_fluffyroad on IG ‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh my god when she falls asleep!!!
I love how alarmed she looks when there are like 15 separate tiny hands stroking her at once lol
My favorite is the kid who shyly waves at her with a big grin
This, in turn, made me smile
God I miss pre COVID time
You are not Cheddar.
I wish i see more dogs in backpacks!
I'm going to be *that* person and just mention pup wasn't very happy with all those kids around her; a bit over whelming: the eyes tell you.
Otherwise, very content!
There needs to be a law: a minimum number of people MUST carry corgis in public
Maxine the Corgi!  She's got some great new youtube videos where she reviews toys!

The good times , when we where even allowed to be close to each other.
Was that Ridiculously Photogenic Guy taking a pic on the escalator?
This comment section REALLY hates that cop because he wasn‚Äôt smiling ... maybe it was a long day and he‚Äôs tired .. maybe he didn‚Äôt wanna invade dudes privacy and get all in the dogs face ... 

The cop isnt automatically an asshole because he didn‚Äôt pet the dog. C‚Äômon people be better than that.
Can I borrow ur corgi in a backpack for 1 day. Should set me up with enough dates for life.
Lol anyone see the cop who kept on looking at the dog
Is it me, or are corgis the most adorable dog breed of all time?
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN MY HEART IS LITERALLY MELTING
I smiled the whole time I watched this
You need to go on tour üòª 
Start with Springfield MO please
Obviously I have to get a corgi. My game would improve 1000%.
From a dog's perspective people must all seem super friendly and affectionate.  Strangers all seem to love them off the bat. They only really get positive interactions from random passersby.  But it's just cuz they're dogs and they deserve it.
u/savethisvideo
This is so more acceptable to do with dogs than cats
The cop wishing he had a corgi backpack too.
That corgi must feel like the goodest boi ever
You know this is pre covid because noone is wearing a mask.
Life is beautiful when you have a Corgi by your side
Either that cop is medically unable to smile or had the worst day of his life.
The music reminds me of ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always sunny in Philadelphia‚Äù.
No wonder corgis are so happy, look at how everyone looks at them like they are a star or Santa Claus as a kid or free money.
I miss pre Covid life
That doggo is living its best life
That dog must feel like a rockstar.
I want to get a corgi‚ù£Ô∏è
This is the easiest way to improve everyone's life in a 10 foot radius around you. God that's such a cute doggo.
He protecc

But most importantly, 

He fit in a backpacc

Am adorable floofs ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't like tiny dogs.  But there has always been something about Corgis that I love.  I think it's that they always seem to be punching above their weight.  It's like they have no idea that they are 1 foot tall and weigh 30 pounds.  They act like their a 70 pound German Shepard.....
wow this dog brings too much joy in this world :)
Ok if this doesn‚Äôt make your day something is wrong.  COVID can‚Äôt even bring this shit down!!

How does she let you know to let her down for toilet?
I can't express what extreme comfort and happiness these videos bring me. It seems like heaven to just have your little buddy on adventures with you. Also the cute factor of the dog is through the roof.  

10/10 would recommend your life to others.
A tiny human in a backpack like that would be so angry with that much contact from other people.
That cop was trying so hard not to smile lol
That head roll kills me. Corgi's are so goofy, I love it.
What a darling
What is this song? I really like it!
The corgi has a fan club.
It really is that simple sometimes
Thank you so much for uploading this. It made me smile as heck. I needed that.
Does it have back problems or pain from the backpack?
I needed this today.

People would ask to take pics of my dog when she was in a backpack. Sometimes I wonder where the pictures are on the internet.
So many pets
Maxine and marcel are my favourite corgis online.

Thank you for putting a smile on my face everytime i see maxine on instagram.
‚ÄúWowzers am goez on adventure, and gets all attention‚Äù
Her name is Maxine and she lives in NY with her owner! He takes her to work with him almost everyday and has a special backpack for her ü•∞
When I die I‚Äôd like to be reincarnated as exactly this corgi
She may not know it, but she's a professional therapy dog.
This never gets old no matter how many times I watch it.
What happens when the dog has to go to the bathroom?

Who wouldn‚Äôt smile when they see a corgi?
Ah the before times when we didn‚Äôt wear a mask. Bittersweet
They look so happy and confused üòÇ
WHY IS NO ONE WEARING A MASK?!?! Seriously cute doggo, 10/10, would pet again. BUT SERIOUSLY PEOPLE PUT A MASK ON! THERE IS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC!

Edit: Sorry everyone, I didn't do a good job here, was supposed to be a joke. I figured it wasn't filmed this year. Too many people look happy, and you know... present, for this to be recent. Still though, for all of us in the present crisis, wear a mask :)
As a fellow Seattle redditor, I hope to see this dog some day!
Shit made me smile. And I haven‚Äôt smiled since the early 90s
I need a corgi and a backpack, stat
Needed this so damn bad
That dog absolutely believes he is King.
I bet that dog gets dude laid.
Everybody saying Awwwe but me just wondering if this was before Corona cuz no one is wearing masks
I live in NYC and every day I hope I see this dog. üòÇ
I want a Deliveroo/UberEats system where I can order a guy with a dog to turn up at my location for a little doggo fussing time, to get me through the rest of the day please
I got a backpack like this to carry my corgi in after seeing it a while ago.   It works well.  I have a long girl who isn't overweight just big.  She's a tank carrying around.
That is such a patient and well adjusted dog. Having that many strangers just up in his personal bubble and being okay. Good Boy.
I miss not having to always wear a mask.
Don‚Äôt mind me I‚Äôm just enjoying pre covid times
I love love love love this post.

I love this, but I can't stop thinking about the poop or pee in the backpack when you get home
Scared boi
One of the best stress relievers is to pet a dog.  He's also loving the attention.
Whats more adorable - the corgi, or people siling to corgi?
Pre-covid nyc :/

That corgi is just straight up vibing!
New York cops some of them are the worst he seems so smug & joyless!!!

Hey !! At least buy me dinner first !!!
The best part is that the dog doesn‚Äôt look stressed out at all.
I just realized how used I got to the new normal. ‚ÄúLook, people aren‚Äôt wearing masks, what a joyful era that was!‚Äù

If you ever want friends, just get a to-go puppers :)
I see no mask
Needs the Cowboy Beebop soundtrack. A+ 12/10 would give ms corgi all the scritches
The is wholesome AF.
Minus that one cop.
The corgi had two stressful moments, but he certainly loved some of those pets
Because I‚Äôm a judgy-mcjudgeington I was initially thinking, ‚Äòdogs aren‚Äôt babies, gross!‚Äô 

But your dog genuinely seems to enjoy this, and all the attention so I‚Äôm like, ‚Äòok ok, I will let myself enjoy this.‚Äô Insert heart eye emoji
I love the group of school kids! They are all so happy and puppers looks all shy
He is the Messiah!
Soo cute. Such a good boy/girl, yes you are!
Imagine standing in a train and suddenly you feel something licking the back of your head but luckily this time when you turn around it's this cute  puppy
Im not showing this to my corgi, she is enough of a princess as it is. If she knows she can be carried around and adored by endless people she may attempt world domination.
I wonder if he knows how many people he relaxed that day
Cop probably just had a long day, maybe he has his own dog at home
One mask in this video, is this somehow pre covid?
Also the music selection üëåüèº delightful
what kind of bag is that? would love to get one for my mini-schnauzer =)
If this guy isn't a serial killer he absolutely could be and the cop knows it.

We needed corgi on polling places. That would have been a therapeutic.
The cop wanted to let him so bad
I have the same backpack! Thankfully I could order it from Germany. We love it! My dog gets tired now on hikes and so she can have a rest on my back.
But she would get nervous when so many people at once  would surround and touch her.
I never get tired of these!

What do you think about people petting your doggo?

Obviously you're fine with it, but do you prefer people ask first?

I have friends who just got a Corgi pup and they're super protective of it, not letting people pat it without asking first, even putting a little "do not pat me" tag on his harness.

To be fair their immune systems are compromised and there's a pandemic going on. Plus the dog does get overwhelmed by giant hands coming at it. But still, seems a bit over protective to me ü§î

Omg what kind of backpack? I‚Äôve been wanting one for my shiba
Zwei is you?!
I wanted to make a joke and say that I forgot what people looked like before masks but.. MOTHERFUCKERS STILL OUT HERE NOT WEARING ANY

Maxime...I'm sure someone posted this, but if not .....Instagram for this corgo .... madmax\_fluffyroad such a sweet corgi!
Well this is obviously an old af video...no masks, no social distancing..ah..I remember the good ol' days.
Anybody realise the guard and the corgi were doing the same face.
I love everything about this thanks
People are making that dog smile just as much as it makes them smile. That adorable little face is having the time of its life
This made my day - thank you!
Good way to pick up chicks.
I want to do this with my cat
If I had a dog like this on my back people still wouldn't approach me
Subtle dig at the cop.
0:28 he looked kinda anxious
Police officer at 36 seconds was eye fucking the camera hard
Thank you! It's what we need right now.
I miss my city and it's people.
Now he thinks he's a kind of god
I miss the good old days
The guy on the escalator was so friendly looking
I need more of this
The girl at the end and the corgi had a cute moment i must say
All dogs are great, but corgis are like samples of what to expect from heaven. I would love to have one some day.
"You gotta pet him so he can feel it "

The Corgis I've been around are actually pretty mean.
All those pets! Beautiful doggo.
I miss pre-covid days...

You know that video where hot chicks will go around in tight pants and record guys looking at their butts? This is the wholesome version of that.
Certainly made myself and many others smile as well. Love a great repost.
Aww in the before times üò¢
I would love to know what backpack he used to hold the dog
I‚Äôve seen these two around the city :)
I wish I had awards to give. This made me smile more than anything else in the last two months since my mom passed away. This is just precious and absolutely wholesome.
What a charmed and interesting life this pup leads.
Not a single fucking mask

That is one of the best things I've ever seen.
I love Corgis
The dog is like
Who the hell are these people petting me? But free pets
Hope this video is old because all I see are soon to be dead people waiting at the graveyard list. On the other hand, that officer keeping his composure must be like... MUST. NOT. PAT.
That dog is liiiiviiiing the liiiiiife

None smiling as big as that Corgi
VERY GOOD VIDEO.
Omg this makes me so happy
She's such a good girl!!!!!ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

Does anyone have anything like this video but ... 3 hours long?
I could watch an hour of this.

Thats so great. We can all use some smiles!!
This is just about what I needed right now. Smiling is great!
Man.. that police officer is just *dead* inside... I mean, not even a flicker of reaction to the pupper. That's cold.
this is super cute... but I guess people in New York(?) just don't get to see a lot of dogs? is that why there's such a fascination?
Best 53 seconds of my life

Aw
THIS IS WHAT 2020 NEEDS!
Where do you get a doggy backpack?
This is amazing lol makes me laugh
Omg if my college professor hadn‚Äôt already moved out of the city, I would so have asked if you were him!!!!

Any chance on the deets for the bag? I have a corgi I would also like to take everywhere. She loves to be held but is too friendly for public.
Public service at its best. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Guys drowning in woman
Ahww ‚Äòmember pre-covid? 
It was so cute
Why do we all talk to dogs with a high pitch voice?
I love the parts where the dog was dozing off lol I love corgis.  I've only ever had good experiences with them.
An hour and a half of this would probably save the movie theaters tbh

Making people smile and a cutie, this is one of the most adorable things ever
Very much needed. Thanks
It‚Äôs like Kamala Harris carrying Biden around to nursing homes
The COVID super spreader corgi
The corgi is the real winner here.
I get the same reaction motorcycling with [my muffinheaded biscuitbutt in San Diego traffic](http://www.calamarichris.com/wp-content/uploads/200916-nenker-katesessions.jpg). 

It rules to watch peoples' day suddenly get brighter and better in these dark times.

This gave me tears of joy.
Gods work right here.
I want more! I could watch this for hours.

Ah yes. The beforetimes.
Must be before Covid no one wearing masks, good to see everyone happy and smiling though, even me, nothing like animals to make your day.
No matter your religion...
No matter your politics...
No matter your gender...
No matter your orientation...

Backpack corgi.
So nice. Thank you
Please make a YouTube channel of just corgi backpack videos. I would watch that shit ALL DAY!
