Do the bees accept you as part of their life or do they get super defensive every time you try to do your job with them?
Hey can I use this for r/RealBeesFakeTopHats? I'll credit you of course
never thought i could consider bees to be cute... huh
Bees are cuter than cute.    I usually have up to 50 at a time in my garden at any one time.    Several different types of bees.  Large black and yellow stripey fluffy ones.    Small beige unstriped ones.    I saw one completely black one the other day, first time ever, maybe a mutant bee.     

They all completely ignore me and let me come within inches of where they are collecting their pollen.  They have come to know that I never harm them or interfere with them, I just get on with my gardening and they just get on with their pollen collecting from all the flowers in my garden.
I do, I really do.
Best tiny buzzing puppies
I've had a profound fear of insects for as long as I can remember, and it has a huge blind spot for bees. They're so adorable, and are some of the gentlest animals I've worked with. I love keeping beehives, it's super rewarding, highly recommend :)
My dad has a bumble bee nest in his cabana attic. Is there someone who would gently remove them and keep them for free? I don't want them killed cuz they are nice bees and they don't attack us, but they do buzz buzz a lot.
Lol imagine if beekeepers argued as to who has the cutest bees.

"Shut the fuck up Karen my bees are cuter, your bees look like my mother in law"
Helloooo Beeesss!
Beauty is in the eye of the bee-holder.
I love bees and think they are adorable! Bumble bees are my favourite though. They’re so loud, clumsy, round and fuzzy. I try to have flowers in my garden every spring and I let the dandelions grow on my lawn for them!
I like them but I think they could be cuter if they were wearing some sort of hat or helmet.
I beelieve you are correct in their cute assetment.
Bees?
Those bees are hella cute and also, I wanted to thank you for being a bee keeper? I know someone who’s a bee keeper too and I’ve heard that the job’s getting really tough because of adulterated substances in the market from China and such places. Thank you for giving us real honey, and thank you for taking care of the bees and appreciating them enough to think they’re cute! Cause honestly bees are so fucking important people don’t understand that
Beeeutiful
Hello beees!
You have really nice bees.
Eeep! OP can you explain what is this picture? Are they drinking/hydrating? 
I’m in CA—we get lots of tired bees from the heat and I want to help! 

PS does sugar water actually help them? 
Thank YOU for being a bee keeper!!
Honey puppers.
r/awwnverts would love this.
Have you named them
suddenly im not scared of buzzy fluffs
I honestly never knew bees were cute. Thanks for sharing!
Hello, bees! Thank you for all your hard work! 😊
😍
Hello, bees.
Hello bees! 🥰
They can be cute. I really like bees but I still get irrationally nervous when they fly near me. I KNOW they won't sting unless provoked, but it is a visceral response.

&#x200B;

We definitely need them more a LOT more than they need us.

Cute bees. I've always wanted to get into bee keeping
I love them and wish I could snuggle them all
I aww’d out loud. They cute.
D'ya like jazz?

The cutest little bees indeed.
They’re 🅱️eeUtiful
I've rarely seen anything more ferociously adorable!

I'm in love...
Yep, your bees are cute.  I was at a business they other day that had a huge patch of what I believe was lavender and the bees flying about on the flowers was adorable to watch.
They are delightful...I love bees. Even the wee one which stung me under my middle toe last week. It hurt like hell but more than anything I felt bad for the little guy (or gal?).
I love bees.
Indubitabeeee!And those little tongues!
What good bees. I love them.
Keep up the good work.
Bees ARE the cutest! I miss my beekeeping days, never ending wonderment 🤩
I love it when their little legs are super fat with pollen. Chonky.
They are very cute.  Good use of the purple color, too!
I work on a vineyard in BC, Canada. Honey Bees are a common sighting. I captured this little guy last year. 

Bees are our allies!

This past fall I saved a few bees that got into our house. I fed them a combination of sugar and water until they regained strength and released them back outside.

The hardest part was protecting them from the cats!
Hello bees!
My uncle is a beekeeper and he let me see the birth of a bee. Beautiful animals, and definitely one of my favourite insects. I love their fluffiness and the big black eyes!
Thank you! I think bees are adorable and my husband thinks I’m crazy. We use langstroth hives (the background of your picture looks like you might not) and they gather at the top of the frames and watch you while you work. So many little eyes! It makes my heart happy. I’m glad I’m not alone.
They're nearly as cute as mine; https://imgur.com/a/eFbvVld
Mine are Italian. Sweet as hell. Mind their own business and never cause any trouble. They just do their thing beeing around...

But they are lazy... Again, Italians. Unlike most bees, they don't start their day until like 10:30, and call it in well before sunset.
[deleted]
Super Cute! Are honey bees 🐝 normally this light colored? I truely do not know.  Thanks
According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
I have developed quite the affection for bees, thanks for sharing! The younger me wouldnt say such a thing as i was raised that most or all insects are bad and will bite you. Its been a pleasure to learn otherwise!
i love bees! Thanks pollinating stuff yo!
Good boizzzzz
“My sweater is Ralph Lauren and I have no pants” 😂
Thank you for giving the bees the love and admiration they deserve 🐝
I rescued a bee in our conservatory the other day. It licked sugar water off my finger. Feeling it's little tongue thingie on my finger was really cool and hearing it lick the sugar water on the plate was too.

Seeing it go from barely able to walk to buzzing around was amazing, as was the two thank you buzzes around my chin and body before it flew out the door.
You better beelieve it
this will probably get lost in the comments but i hope you know that youre doing a big part of keeping our ecosystem together by taking care of those bees. thank you very much.
They're sweet as honey. I love them!
OP fighting the good fight. Keep it up fella 🙌🏼
They're the bees knees!
First time novice beekeeper here. I have 2 hives I got at the end of last summer and 1 swarm I caught this spring. So far, the first two barely have built anything on the new frames...started 2 but barely. The new hive started from scratch since I caught the swarm but has built like 4 massive full frames in little time - however they are much more aggressive. Any thoughts? How long does it take before you can collect some honey? I’m wanting to go as organic and natural as possible, so I don’t want to feed syrup and other crap.
Do you accidentally kill some of them when you harvest their honey?
I did bee keeping with some people last year and loved it but had to stop because I have allergies to them that are worse then I thought
Cute af
I'm allergic to bees but who cares. They're still cute!
What are their names?
Bees are awesome lovem!
Look at your girls awe
Yes, but what about their knees?
Which one is your favorite? It’s ok, I won’t tell the others.
How large of a property do you need to keep a hive for personal use?

How far away do they have to be from homes and other people to keep them from being an issue with others?
2️⃣🐝or➰2️⃣🐝
I like bees. I hate wasps. I talk to the bees that buzz by me while I walk. I'm not a flower, bee. Can't you see? Okay, bye-eee.
They are surprisingly
They need some top hats.

This public service announcment has been brought to you by: r/RealBeesFakeTopHats

Don't forget to to give adorable real bees dapper fake top hats.
I do.
slurp.ogg
Cute little honey pukers!
No top hats? 🎩
I've always thought bees are adorable! So cute and fuzzy. Where I live we get giant fuzzy bumblebees too. They're so gentle and never bite or sting.
Wow! This is such a great photo! How did you get into bee keeping?
Give us pics of their butts. We like bee butts and we cannot lie
Question (serious): Where do bumble bees fit into beedom? Are they just giant, furry rogue bees, or are they part of a hive?
i saw my best friends little sisters best friend      (w o w) touch the back of bees when they were on flowers and she never got stung once
Isn’t the latest update that bees are smart as fuck too?
Bonus points if you can get a pic of their little bee bums!
Adorbs!! Thanks for the share!
bees are legit the cutest of bugs but unfortunately that buzzing is inherently a danger signal at an evolutionary level so most people never get close enough to realize it.
Omg their little tongues 😭
Super cute
They are really cool wish I wasn’t allergic to them though,  like once I got stung in the thumb it swelled to 3x the size it was normally and my breathing felt labor intensive. That was just one sting.
You should adapt this to fit r/realbeesfaketophats
the mlems!! they’re so cute!! 💛
Bees are simultaneously adorable and frightening. They are cute on flowers but terrifying when they land on you.
save the bees
You were right! Your bees are super cute, tell them they're doingna good job for me
Honey bees are my favorite. I've held one before. They're soft!
I do like your bees. They are very cute and fuzzy.
Work it girls!
They are the cutest!
More people should LOVE bees!
I love everything about this photo
For a second I thought they vomited..

But yes they are cute! SAVE THE [BEES](https://open.spotify.com/track/57VCE3cxTRDVgFmRCrROS6?si=flcb8pdcTseTp4rO2VtReg)!

Awww beeeees! How adorable. :)
haha I may  think bees are cute but I will still fear them *WITH* ***LOVE***
They're beautiful!
I can’t bee-lieve how they can look cute up close
my boyfriend called them “stinger pups” and suddenly they’re even more adorable
Look at those sweet little friends
I love them! Please tell them they are loved and adored by this random stranger.
Survive little bees, SURVIVE!
They're BEE-utiful!
r/awwnverts will love them
Your bees are indeed the cutest. :)

*Edit* grammar
They really are
I like the fuzzy yellow one
r/realbeesfaketophats
i love beeees ❤️ thank you
Bees: Hello, I like flowers, please don't bother me, I kinda get mad easily...

Wasps: *B--CH, YOU WANNA F--KIN' DIE?!*
Bees are a blessing. They make agriculture possible, provide us with wonderful honey and overall are just great little lovebugs.
Cute or not. We need 'em.
Yes. I like what they make as well. Anyone know where I can donate money for bee preservation?
I LOVE BEES
Cute, but not as cute as bee butts!!

About 15 years ago my friend had a party at his house while his parents were gone for the night. We cleaned the entire place, got rid of the evidence and went to bed.

His parents woke us up early in the morning. Here's the conversation:

Parents: Did y'all have fun last night?

Us: Sure? We just played video games and went to bed...

P: Are y'all sure about that?

Us: Um yeah? Why do you ask?

P: Because there is a red solo cup outside with a bit of Smirnoff left in it. There are also 20 bees in the cup, drunk, and unable to fly off.

One of those situations where two 17-year-olds can't talk their way out of it.
I love bees ❤️ I have a tattoo of one on my forearm because my mom calls me her baby bee! I had such a love and appreciation for them
TBH...they really are!
Thank you for your work. Please keep it up
Your bees are the best! Keep on beeing!
Your bees look so different from the bees in my area and that makes me happy. The diversity of bees.
[Bee Keeper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aFJCfoi8FU) you say?
I love bees
Extremely cute bees, 10/10 would help save.
Just a few bees pollen around.
I do find them particularly cute
I gave a bee some honey... he came back with a friend. They came back with 2 friends. They were just the cutest.
What pretty little ladies!
Aww what are their names?
They are beautiful.  So bright and fuzzy!
They require top hats
AOOOOUUHHH THEY FLUFYYYYYYYY
Those are some unusually cute bees.
I love bees so much I can never help but record them when I’m near them, I hope they stop declining!
Nice! I just started keeping bees about a month ago and it's a lot more fun than I expected
Huh. Yup cute bees. Also the picture is fabulous, great job!
Yessssss! Thank you for keeping bees!!
I want to pet one.
I love them, I love these bees 🐝💛🐝
Your bees are great
More bee pics please!
Bees are the only insect that when one approaches me I freeze, hoping that they *will* land on me.
They are unbeelievably cute
They are the cutest lil bugs ever!
Spicy flies.
The past few years I've found myself growing much fonder of bees than I ever thought I would. They never bothered me as a child, even when I was very little, I never noticed when I was stung while playing.

If I find them in my home I usually let them onto my hand and walk them out. This spring I found one with 5 legs and he was pretty awesome.

Still, I really want to ask: how does one get into this line of work? What is the tipping point for making the decision? What are the investments and licenses like? Asking for a friend.
Bees are pretty cool
Quick, photoshop tophats onto them.
When I was a kid I loved saving bees while I was in the pool and then see them fly away after they dry off. But once the bee had already died by the time I got to it and when I realized, I got really sad and held a funeral for it :’)
Bee keeping is cool and underrated af. I love this
Apparently we really need them so good work!
Omg I love it
Your bees are definitely r/aww material!  Found an exhausted honey bee on my driveway a few weeks ago.  I gently coaxed her onto a stick and brought her into the shade before going inside to put some local raw honey onto a spoon.  Poor thing looked like she wasn't going to make it.  I left her alone but continued to check on her every 10 minutes or so.  About half an hour later she was devouring the honey.  Another 15 minutes after that and she was looking quite sprightly.  I whispered that I love her as she hovered in front of my face for 10 seconds or so before flying away to continue her badass job of pollinating the world <3
I love bees.  Hornets and wasps are evil.
Bees are precious. I love them 💕🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝

As a bee keeper, how did you feel about Bee Movie?
Gang Gang.
They are cute
Bees (especially of the bumble variety) are quite cute. Wasps are flying terror machines.
What can the every day person do to help bees besides not use pesticides? Can we plant certain plants? Can we have like bee coffee shops in our yards where they can stop and relax for a little before going back to work? Thanks in advance!
I watch a lot of bee videos online. While I hate almost all incects, bees never gave me the heeby jeebies (minus the panic that I'm going to be put in pain, although I always remain physically calm and never swat or react). I've said I want to bee keep one day, although I'll need to get out of the city first.
They are definitely the cutest!
Class yourself up a bit.  You're an Apiarist extraordinaire!
I’m a 40yr old male and am very afraid of bees.  No joke, I think since I was a child and my mother instilled in me a fear of being stung.  I can hold snakes, swim with sharks (have done both) but can’t do bees.  So sorry I don’t find them cute.  But all the best!
I adore bees. If I am near flowers or plants and see a little bumble bee buzzing around I’ll usually stalk it 😂 not close enough to scare it away (or be stung) but just to talk to it the way I talk to my cat. 

I really need my mouth taped when it comes to adorable critters. I just can’t help myself making strange sounds and speaking in high pitch voices to them. Poor things 😂😂
I want so badly to become a beekeeper myself
*stops scrolling* oh shit, they are cute!
I wish that I had a couple of hives.  I have a shitload of honey bees, but none of them actually live on my property.  I even have a nice spot that's alternatively shady and warmed up a little bit by the Sun...
quick somebody add some top hats
Eyes look like marbles
I love bees!  
  
I found a grounded bee once outside on the ground, so I brought him in and put him in an empty glass along with a droplet of honey. I couldn't believe it when I saw him put the honey on his legs, so that he could scale the side of the otherwise too smooth glass. I had no idea they were so clever.  
  
About a day later he had regained enough strength that he could fly away, it made me really appreciate how wonderful bees are.
Most of the posts on here that get gold and or silver i think don't deserve it but this one sure does!
Gorgeous photo.
I’m not meaning this to be a racist bee  remark, but they all look the same.
Libtards thinking bees are cute. Africanized bees invading our southern border. We are a nation of laws. BUILD THE WALL !!!
I’m afraid of honeycomb. Trypophobia. So weird.
bees are always adorable.
and also, thank you for being a part of one of the most important businesses in the world right now. we need as many beekeepers as we can get to stop them from dying off. 

but again, your bees are adorable
Bees are so cute. They are so underrated.
These buzz buzz bois are so cute!
Thank you for your service.  (Genuine)  We couldn't eat without people like you.  I aspire to do just that if/when I retire.  Thanks!
You are probably saving the world. Thank you for your service
My grandpa had some citrus groves, and he raised bees on the side. I’d like to do it myself someday, but I’m sure that my brother (who likes to joke that I’m a grizzly bear because I’m big and hairy) would never let me hear the end of it.
It is a fact- they ARE the cutest.
r/realbeesfaketophats 

They are cute! Someone’s gonna ‘borrow’ that photo if you don’t beat them to it! 😉.   😁👏👏👏 🎩➕🐝=true happiness 😁👏👏👏
this is un-bee-lievably cute.
Hello bees!
I think your bees are really cute too 💛
Your bees do important work, and honestly they are kinda cute
Bee your beeself and never let the bees get sad
I think most insects are cute, but especially honey bees!
suns out tongues out
How the hell are the combs so yellow? I've never seen one so brightly coloured.
Bees are fucking vile
Id think they're cute if they didnt have a deadly stinger for those like myself who are allergic. Even without being deadly, it still packs a punch for pain
Damn I never knew bees could bee cute
[r/RealBeesFakeTopHats](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealBeesFakeTopHats/) could turn these into cute gentlemen.
I love honey bees it's spectacular🤩🤩🤩🤩
Bees are magnificent.
You really seem to think they're quite the bees' knees.
u/SkyCuboid us in the future??
They look like they just stumbled out of a bar and threw up in the parking lot.
Thanks them, from my behalf!
I love bees, and I love their honey too!  
Here is one of my favorite songs, that speaks about the love for bees(sorry its in my language): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlZEtORgR-g](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlZEtORgR-g)
This could make for a really sweet phone wallpaper.
Clever, fluffy, and doing their best for the planet. What’s not to love, they are super cute!!
Never thought I would find bees cute. Nice
Holy shit I'm a massive apiphobe. But I think I can deal with these ones
THEY'RE VERY IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bees are cute and awesome.
They are beautiful, and i love them
We extract our first batch of honey today. Took up beekeeping last year.
I dunno about you guys but there something about their knees that are just really awesome.
Do bees develop some sort of feeling/knowledge about you over time ? Like „Oh thats just Mr. Bee keeper, he is no thread to us.“ ? I love bees they’re so cute lol
[deleted]
Those are some sweet af bees ngl
According to all know laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
I found a bee in one of our buckets filled with water and it was drowning. I saved it, gave it some honey (yeah, don’t know if it works like that) and it chilles there for a solid 10 minutes with me and then flew away. I felt like the bee appreciated me, compared to other situations where I’ve saved a ladybug or something.
Awww bees are precious in more ways than one 😊😊😊
I never expected this to blow up as it did! Its amazing there are so many lovely people out there who want to help the bees! Thanks for those who gave the gold and silver and for the lovely comments :) I have tried to respond to as many as I can I'm sorry if I missed you!
They are cute and important
Gotta love the furry ones. 😍😍😍
Aw, what lil cuties
Do they like jazz though?
OP will probably never see this, but damn, they are beautiful!  Please give us hungry Redditors *more*.
Is it racist to say I think they all look the same?
No”bee”dy:

Beekeeper w/ Camera: *Exists*

Bees: ah shit, here we go again. Everybody act “cute”, or...something...
Thank you for what you do!
HELLO FELLOW BEEKEEPER
Till one day, you're outside enjoying a smoke and coffee and Reddit and suddenly BOOM, stung on the foot and the little bastard is dragging his guts behind him. Fuck you, bee
I've always loved petting their little fuzzy backs :) adorable for sure! Thanks for taking good care of the bees.
Aww. You keep those cute bees alive. We are lost without them!
Doing the lords work 🙏 god bless the bees 🐝
Now that you say it yes they are cute and but you are cuter for saying that!
How the F those things fly?
They look so clean and fresh, are they supposed to be looking like that?
As an entomophobe i always find ot very strange that people can consider insects cute.
There really is a taste for everything.
Thank you for your service, doing a job I could not. But naw. Great pic but I’d still be terrified if they ran up on me in the street, LOL. I’m a wuss.
Theres a subreddit that I think you would fit quite well in. It's r/beesintophats or somethin idk..but it's an entire sub dedicated to daper bees
Hey what’s it like being a keeper of bees
they are cute but those holes in the background are giving me shivers
This picture made me stop breathing
I've recently become interested in beekeeping but I have no idea where to start
Is it true that bee keepers rip the wings off of the queen? I remember reading that and it made me very sad, I never had the chance to actually ask one.
Just wanna snuggle then, ohhh wait almost got me there
Bees are cool... Its the wasps that are a problem
What did you photograph it with?
Gonna be real cute when they sting your eye balls
My first thought was that the 3 bees are puking outside of big bee party.
Imma go show this post tonmy friend who has a phobia of bees. Seeya
Is it true that you have to regularly talk to the bees or the colony will collapse?
Bees are precious flying sugar bois
I was walking the other day (southern CT, kinda hot out) and saw a bee on the ground walking in a circle. Can someone explain what was going on with them?
Honestly, like everyone else i’ve always seen bees as a pest and killed them with a swatter or something, but seeing how much someone else appreciates them I kinda feel bad now :/
r/ohshittheyregonnastingme
As much as I enjoy honey all I see when I see bees is the Disney bee stinging me and me dying as I'm allergic. So I hope you won't mind me saying they are not cute to me.
Bee cuter if the hive wasn't setting off my trypophobia bleerrgghh
So, apparently they're not house broken yet...

How hard is it getting into bee keeping?
These little guys look fat and healthy! I hate wasps but I respect the honey bee 🐝
Hey Barry
Ah yeah make that honey.
I almost went visit an apiary in Granville Mass today but didn’t have time
Second
Adorable! They look fake!
Why are they almost pastel in color lol?
My daughter agrees! She hates all bugs. Is scared of ants and ladybugs but loves bees and will happily watch them.
I like my bumble bees better. What kind of bees are these?
thirsty boizzz
i like them when they don't sting me
How was it to get started bee keeping?
I hate wasps I hate spiders but I have alway liked bees
Coool Cool cool cool, they can be cute away from me.
Are these bees on a bender?
Am I the only one who thinks they look like they’ve just stumbled out of the bar?
About beekeeping is it hard to keep Hornets,Wasps, and other animals that kill bees away.
Barry B Benson would like to know your location
Can I taste your juice!?!
[deleted]
Bumblebois sure
Bees are so cute!!!  Omg!! 💕



But I like them even more when they're away from me. Far, far away from me! 😭😭
They're cute, but I'd still rather them not touch me.
I just dont like em buzzing around so close to me, how often do they sting a normal person going about thier business?
I'mma be I'mma be I'mma I'mma I'mma be
Yup. Bee bros for sure. Admiration and respect in it's sincerest form from me. Thanks for helping out Earth. I'm sure it would appreciate it if it could!
They're adorable!
And what's the little patch behind their heads, The little bald spot? It looks like a petting area 😄😂
Your bees \*are\* the cutest!!
They’re breathtaking!
No, no I don't. I'm entomophobic though (which means I'm apiphobia too).

Still to each their own...
How much of a commitment is it to care for bees
Well, i'm over my fear of spiders so I don't think this would be too big of a stretch
Hi
I live them!
I was terrified of bees until 6 months ago when I started doing BVT for lyme. Just got my hive a few weeks ago to hopefully give a little back for all the hunnies do. 🐝🐝
SLORP SPLORP SLURP
I do not. They can sting you. I know they are important. Just want them to do their thing and leave me bee.
They looked like they just stumbled out of a pub and barfed on the sidewalk.
I want to do this as a hobby/environmental good... where could I start?
awwww, they are. every day I go to the pool at my apartment building, and every day I have to save 2-3 bees from drowning in it. when I pick them up I get to take a close look at them and realize how cute they really are. after doing that for a few weeks I'm not at all scared of them anymore. except for wasps, and bumblebees (haven't gotten used to bumblebees \[dont ever see them\]), those are absolutely terrifying. honeybees are cute. Edit: i will never like carpenter bees, NEVER
Then youre gonna love what I just discovered 5 minutes ago r/honeyfuckers
Oh hell nawh, the background triggers my phobia
Aww they are cute, and sweet 🌷
Hi ladies! You're all just awesome!
My neighbour has a hive that is flourishing so much that last week, a beach ball sized swarm moved into a tree in my yard. They managed to get all of them including the queen boxed off and moved to a new hive.

It was amazing to witness. I thought they had built a hive but it was this massive pulsing swarm.
You're doing the lords work being an apiarist!
They're the bees knees 🐝
Your bee look super healthy
Beeutiful
Four stars. Cute bees.  Would keep.
I just had a beekeeper remove a hive from my house. So glad he was able to take them and move them!
I save countless bees from drowning in my complex’s pool everyday. I’m very allergic to stings, but haven’t been stung once by the ones I pick up out of the water. I keep my epi-pen handy but them seem to appreciate the effort.  
I appreciate all they do for us, and think your bees are cute too!
Your bees are my new phone wallpaper and they make me so happy ❤❤
Is there an easy way to tell which are honey bees and which are Africanized ones? Just so I know who to save from the pool
As far as bees go, they are cuter than most!
Once I was kayaking and a giant fluffy bumblebee was apparently hitchhiking on my shoulder. When I noticed it RIGHT NEXT TO MY FACE, I freaked and just instinctively flicked it into the river. I felt horrible watching it flail around in the water so I scooped it up with my paddle. It regained it's barings and took off! Bees are cool. 🐝
I don't beelieve it.
this made me happy :)
Do they attack you at times or have they grown accustomed to you?
Do they know that you are their friend?
Bees are cute
I'm also a Beekeeper and your bees are cute
I love your bees!
These are like... old Disney cartoon bees
Bee's are one of the only bugs I find cute, but I can't go near them because I'm afraid of being stung.
We need to bee saving the environment
The cutest bees 😍 Knowing all the negatives, it's nice someone can appreciate these bees in their own unique way. They do have cute eyes and fuzzy exoskeletons.
Thank you kind OP, it recalls me how much I love my girls
I can’t take care of them now I moved to another country, but my father in law is treating them well!
Thank you for being a bee keeper. It's easily the best and most rewarding job. I would love to get into beekeeping but I probably won't be able to. Seriously thank you. :)
Hi, Bumbles! I love you!
Hello, beeeez!
Is it me or is the one on the right a bit crosseyed?
I love them when they dont fly around me xP
I love them thank you for showing us
I respect bees for what they do for our ecology and admit they can be cute.

That said when I hear a buzz in the time it takes for the bee to beat its wings I'll be running in whichever straight line I can find.
We have to protect these babies. For our own sake.
Bless you for keeping bees. They sadly need all the help they can get.
They’re cute until you leave your can of soda on your deck and come back for a drink and one is inside just chillin. Had my lip looking like hitch smh.
As much as I hate flying insects, bees are hella cute and also hella important
Your bees are the knees!

I just wanna kiss their little foreheads
I'm horrified of bees(not bumbles), but i can confirm.
I love them!!
Left Bee Gang.
Omg. LOVE this.
Your bees are very yellow!
Beekeeper. I find that to be a very disturbing term. I don't imagine you employ any bee-free-ers, do you?
I have two huge flowering crab apple trees ... I love seeing literally hundreds of bees in them when they bloom.
I have a serious bee phobia and I use posts like this to fight it. More cute internet bees!
THEYRE PRECIOUS
I agree 100% love love love bees
Thank you for keeping bees. They need all the human friends they can get.
Bees are pretty fuckin dope, OP!  

ETA the local community college offers beekeeping classes. I'm doing it. Bees are so cool.
I love checking out the yellow or orange pollen pant legs bees get while they forage in the garden. They are good friends.
Save the bees people!
Little honey bees are cute. Wasps are assholes.
I love bees now but when I was a kid I was afraid of them because of how they were depicted in cartoons 😂
Bees are great. Don’t scare your kids, just stay still and quiet when a bee is around and say “thank you”
i like ur bees
Sweet honey pals
I love them!
I've always wanted to get Into bee keeping. Any tips for starting out?
I never noticed how cute bees are until now ❤
Yes i do thank you very much for this
Those are some adorable bees
Show fuzzy bee butts!
Bees are cool but having been stung by one, i feel much more comfortable as far away from them as i can be.
Adorable little murder-butts!
CUTE BEES 🐝🐝🐝
🐝♥️
You’re the best for being a beekeeper and you have cute bees!
When I was a young young kid, I was mesmerized when my grandpa would pet the bees while in his garden & sometimes they'd walk on his hand. As an adult, I've petted a couple :)
Bless you for keeping bees safe and caring for them. They are adorable :)
How do you milk those things? Their so small
Thanks for taking care of our buzz-puppies.
Thank you for what you do.
They are adorable.

I would die for them.

Oh I love them! They are adorable!
They're adorable!
My cousin and his girlfriend just became bee keepers! The first bee keeper suit they ordered online arrived and it was short sleeved. I’m assuming there is a reason for this? Are you my cousin?!
this has some good wholesome energy that just draws me in.
Cute is not a word I would ever have associated with bees...but these guys are pretty sweet.
They're so cute! Great photo!! 💜
Cute buzzy boiz
Your yellow buzz-puppies are very welcome in this subreddit!
lookin good! My Dad beekeeps too and I love to watch them work.
So? You like jazz?
Ya so cute to know they are all females too!(well most) and also will die very quickly #hivementality
They are adorable!!!

*squee*
I LOVE BEES!! Short story. We have this slushy machine that people can pour their own syrup. This leads to people missing their ice and getting it on the catch tray. My work put up a bee catcher   because it drew a considerable amount of bees to swarm up. I’ve always liked bees but my mom was allergic so I always had to get rid of them and I loved holding them. So one day at work I was like hmm I wonder if I can touch one. So I put my hand on one and none of them cared! So this lady walks by and says out loud. “Are you the bee whisperer?”.  Once she walked away I said “ I sure am! Buzz buzz bitch! I actually do love bees tho!
Unbeelevably cute
The only insect that i dont find horrible. Love bees
i don’t get how people are scared of bees. sure they sting you, but they’re important creatures
Hey! You should post this to r/awwnverts
Fuck No!!!!
I’m good with honey bees. They’re out doing their own thing. I hate hornet and wasps. Their sole purpose is to be assholes and inflict pain. If Satan is real I believe these creatures are his presence on earth.
Fuckin beegenerates.
People starting to think they're cute...

This is how the bee invasion starts.
Bzzzzzzzzzz- Rubee Rhod
Lullabees... lullabees... honey bees... in the trees... don’t sleep lightly .. your honey is safe.. with me.
Honeybees are the cutest! ❤️
I think the bee cute af 😍
Theese beez be cute AF
I think your bees are beautiful!! I love bees!!

I always viewed bees are cute but couldn't really afford to beekeep Also i'm afraid to get stung by one D:
Am I the only one that thought they were vomiting?
I love bees
How did you learn beekeeping, it’s something I want to do later in my life but I wouldn’t really know where to start.
Hello cute fuzzybums!
They look like they partied too hard and are vomiting everywhere
Now eat their but juice.
fuck yeah bees
So cute... but keep them away from me...
Bees are pretty cute tbh. Not sure why, but they just has that aww vibe to them
I still don't find bees cute. I still remember being stung by a bee when I was younger. It felt like someone took a thick needle and kept burying it down my skin. I was in agony. It was on the foot. I cried like a baby. Even if that did not occur, I still don't find them cute.  Although, I acknowledge and recognize that we need bees for the survival of plants and our ecosystem.
I’m also a bee keeper. They aren’t that cute...especially after being stung and ending up with a swollen hand or face. At least I get tons of honey at the end of July.
I AM THE BEE KEEPER!!! THE KEEPER OF THE BEES!!!
I'm really trying but its hard it may take some time I just can't
For a second, I thought this was r/RealBeesFakeTopHats and was looking for their top hats. Even hatless, they're very cute!
I’m badly allergic to them so I’ll just have to keep my distance .,. And mind my own beeswax huh huh hehehe jk
I dont know much about bees, but I feel that it's pretty clear in this photo that they're happy and healthy. Good job!
Apiary porn ...

Beekake.
This is so wholesome.

I ❤️ 🐝
I got stung on the forehead the other day by a bee significantly less cute than these guys
They are adorable! May I ask how does one become a bee keeper? Is it hard? Is it a full time job?
buzzer bums and sting waffles....pretend they are a support animal and bring them to my dinner
Oh, they are so precious to meeee.
-swoons-
Little fuzzy babies
TBH those bees are actually cute.
Oh my they are the cutest
I'm allergic and they're still cute
Fuzz butts!!
Pretty sure you are a photographer also.
Hey honey!
Their eyes look like little drops of honey!
These are without a doubt, the cutest bees I’ve ever seen.
Bees: good
Wasps: commit die
Do they like jazz?
I like your bees very much
What a beautiful sit!
They're the bees knees!
Any tips for people like me who are absolutely terrified of bees for no logical reason?
Do I see a drone?
So cute
Lol looks like they had too much and puked it all up.  Rad pic.
Gob’s been in this business since early 2000’s
I’m allergic to bees tho
Get a picture of their toes
How does one become a beekeeper?
Beads?
I cant bee-live it. ._.
Nope sorry
Scary
Keep it up
Hi bees.
I’m obsessed with bees. I think they’re the cutest thing ever!
10/10 bees good sir.
[deleted]
Look at those girls, they are adorable, aren't they!  Big puppy dog eyes, all fluffy-floofy!
Bees are very fluffy-looking. What do you think it would be like to pet a bee? 🤔
I haven't seen any honeybees yet this summer. It's heartbreaking.
There’s a bunch of carpenter bees living under my shed and I love them, no matter what anyone else says. They’re just so fat and cute! One of them accidentally bumped into me and kept on going like “Oh dear! I’m terribly sorry.”
How hard is bee keeping? Is it a full time job? Ive always thought it would be cool to do.
Little bumble buddies best boyes!
Beautiful lads you got there ♥️
While I understand they are a vital part of many ecosystems and that they are dying in record numbers which could lead the the extinction of the human race and many other species...

I still am terrified of and hate bees.

There's no quicker way to send me running and screaming like a school girl than one of these fuckers buzzing near my head.
Accidentally knocked down a bumble while it flew about some flowers while watering them. It kinda fell to the underbrush at first. I held my breath and a couple seconds later, it flew out dazed up to a nearby tree branch to dry off. It almost seemed annoyed

Sorry, bee!!
So I’m terrified of bees. Why shouldn’t I believe they aren’t going to sting me as soon as they see me?
Hey since you're a bee keeper maybe you know why so many bees keep drowning in my pool? I know they need water but I would of thought they wouldn't land in the middle of a big body of water cause it doesn't seem like surface tension works for them.
Needs r/realbeesfaketophats
Stunningly beautiful.
All bee keepers think their bees are the cutest.
Buzz buzz b****
Jalapeño sky raisins!
They’re bee-a-utiful.
It's a lovely picture, until I taste their honey.
Un**bee**lievably cute
We’re try to get sone hives going on our family pumpkin patch, but the wasps keep wiping then out.

They really are cute though! It’s weirdly calming to sit and watch them buzz about
What kind of honey bees do you keep?
Hello bees!
BEES ARE IN DANGER PLEASE BE KIND TO BEES AND THE PLANET! <3
I love them like they’re my own bees!
I like bees, sadly i cant distinct them most of the time with wasps, i hate wasps.
EXTRA THICC BEES
Me and the boys eating honey
They are pretty damn cute tho.. 🤔
I’ve recently renovated my backyard and planted lots of plants which flower. I find myself in my garden sipping a drink watching all the bees which never used to be there. I feel a certain level of comfort and being connected with all the new life around me.
There one of very few Insects I like and find not ugly. Like butterflies and praying mantis and lady bugs. Not many but there are a few cool or semi cute ones.
mlem
If it weren't for the fact that I am allergic I would try to pet
🍯🐝💕
My 4 year old is in LOVE with bees and any time she sees one that gets stuck in our gazebo she tries to help them out. She calls dandelions “bee flowers” because i told her they were the bees first food in the spring. 

This photo is absolutely gorgeous and I seriously love it so much. 

Bees are life!
Aww!
I know they're vital to the environment but when I'm having lunch and one of them just starts hovering my can of coke I just leave the table and let it be cause I'm scared. Like almost having a panic attack scared.
I always thought bumblebees were really cute But they don’t give me food. That’s why I like honeybees
" I think you bee keep and I like you alot " (Yolandi voice)
i’ve always been afraid of bees but they’re so adorable when i see them like this
They probably think same thing about you “we are human keeper, cute”
Wow they look golden. Super cute/pretty
1000 times better than all the fans that obsess over Beyonce
I only like the kind that scare, like the ones that belong to my sister.
I spent a long time working in the horticulture industry and I love it when I see people trying to help a little bee out. They are so unbelievably important to this planet. They are the unsung heroes of how humanity feeds itself.
Goddamn, your bees are IMPORTANT
Thanks for what you do.
do you cut queen's wings to  keep the colony from swarming?
I like them a lot, thank you for posting your cute bees.
Spicy flies
You could be a frequent poster on r/realbeesfaketophats
Those bees are cute...but they also look like conniving assholes with a 2nd agenda.

Mmm yeah this tastes great is a setup  we are all good let's get that sombitch when he trusts us enough to take another picture without the suit on.
As far as insects go, bees are by far the cutest
They ARE the absolute cutest! 🐝 🐝 🐝
A bee buzzes onto a bar...
Nope.jpg
Are they getting high off their own supply here?
Because of bees I will be able to get off work early this Friday. They will be relocating a hive that has established in the building in my area so we have to clear out. I love bees.
You like jazz?
I love them! 😍
Please wave to them for me!
How does one help with Bee conservation?
Bees are cute until one catches you off-guard and the first thing you do is freak out internally.
Normally I stay well away because, I'm allergic but now I like bee's
Awesome picture. They look so happy just hanging out.
They really are
Amazing
I admire you for being a beekeeper.

I try to help bees as often as I can. I see them in the yards I mow and try to move around them so they don't get chopped up.

I hate that bees are endangered. 

Bees are important, everyone. Be kind to bees. 🐝❤
SAVE THE BEES!
OMG! I think your bees are the cutest!!
Precious, fuzzy, sweet bumble babies.
Cute little ladies.
Yeah, I like 'em
I love homey bees :)
They're cute but if one of those butts touch me i could die
Give them top hats or I walk
I love them all so much
I was waiting to drive my sister home for about an hour today, and whiole im in the car this little 5 leggfed bee just decideds to chill on my hand. He styed there for hte whole hour jstu chilling.
Damn das some cute-ass bees you got there bro
Cute isn't exactly a word my brain associates with BEES!
I love them! I've always thought honey bees have the cutest eyes
i fucking love bees. wasps hornets yellow jackets can go to hell. bees are adorable and smart but also dumb like cats. i have a tree full of honey bees next to my back door and whenever im outside they are around and hang out with me. love it.
Would you say they’re the....bees knees....
So, so cute! 🐝 I love them!
Is that your arm?
They're 100% not cute. But they're very important so take care of those little fuckers. 

Please dont sting me bees.
Im a mead maker so I fully appreciate you and your bees! Tell them to keep up the hard work!!
I would pat the danger needle, if it would not squish in the attempt
Some cute lil zoomies right there
They don't need to be cute, they're waaay more important than us for this world, even we need them.
I absolutely adore honey bees. Even though I'm allergic  I think they're the cutest. And I love watching them.

I always try to help one out of o see it's hurt, or if it's in my Mails pool I pull it out and put it on one of her plants.
My parents keep bees as a hobby and they are cute but I’ll keep my distance...except the drone bees. You can poke those all you like.
I adore bumblebees!

Especially that thing they do when they park themselves on a flower and rub their tiny little faces with their tiny little furry arms*. 

Just makes me go mwisjdudbfkalsiedjdndaaaaagh!
Bees are dying. Colony collapse. Blame the pesticides as much as you want ,but there something else, way worse. I have no idea what, but it is happening.
Scary cute
[deleted]
They bee precious for sure
They make one of my favorite snacks ♥️
Bees are cute.
Hornets can die in a fire.
the boys
I wanna be a beekeeper when I move out to upstate NY this fall!  Any tips for someone looking to start out?
Bees terrify me (wasps, hornets and yellow jackets even more so)...but through the safety of my screen, your bees are kinda cute
Does your bees know not to sting you?
I think

They're invasive species and killing the native bees, therefore some of the native plants.
Buzzbros
Bees are awesome. They’re super cute, they help with pollination, and they also kill asshole wasps by basically giving them an intense cuddle and roasting them alive
I say hello to bees, I say it super excitedly if I see one of the huge fluffy ones lol.
I've always thought bees were adorable, especially those fluffy fat black fuckers with the one yellow stripe. There's so many different kinds of bees it's mindblowing.
They are super cute
I let a massive bumble bee crawl over my hand yesterday as I was carrying it to the thyme plant. It was pretty scary but I am fairly sure they don't sting. It was a magnificent beastie. My favourite garden pastime is picking up bees and putting them on a flower, I like the way they wake up and start feeding as soon as their face hits the flower.
Fellow beekeeper! Just rescued a wild hive after we had to destroy an aggressive hive (this is not typical). Your bees are cute, tell them they are doing a good job.
they’re so so busy and honestly better organized and have a better work ethic than we humans. just sayin.
How hard are bees to keep?
Cute bees, but those knees!!
I just finished watching black mirror.
I see some possible swarm cells
Do you keep bees professionally and commercially? Or more as a hobby or pastime?
Good job op for saving the world
Need more top hats, then they’ll be perfect. :-)
These things kill me in one hit :(
r/hellointernet
Someone needs to r/realbeesfaketophats this photo
Can someone please please please put top hats on these little guys and post them in r/realbeesfaketophats
when i was a kid we were told to run from them. now i see them and want to help them out and shit
r/RealBeesFakeTopHats please complete this picture
The best bees.
They're your bumblebuds.
Toure saving the opanet6! Whatever bless you
So fuzzy and cute!
I love bees! They know their job is important and don't like interruption. I just planted plenty of sage shrubs and lantana. I want my house to be a haven for those little guys. Btw, sage shrubs attract so many hummingbirds too!
You like Jazz?
Honestly they look like sloppy drunks but you wouldn't be far off if you said it takes one to know one.
Hello bees!
