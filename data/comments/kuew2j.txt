“No thanks. Ask me again when it’s not minus Fuck degrees outside.”

The neighbours' cat showing off his freedom.
Don’t worry buddy I’m scanning the perimeter for a weakness! I will free you soon!
That cat climbing the tree looks exactly like my cat. I had to go check on my cat to make sure she was there.
Girlfriend boyfriend
They are planning the most audacious escape
Tortieshell ragdoll? Your cat looks just like my old cat daisy, she was beautiful!
When I was growing up, we had a tree that was about 6 inches away from our 2nd story living room balcony.   Our cat would away climb up the tree, jump to the balcony, and meow at the sliding glass door to be let in.

Until the one time he didn't quite make the leap and I had to rescue him because his front feet were on the balcony, one on each side of a railing post, and his rear feet were on the tree and he couldn't go forwards or backwards!

The vet later credited all the exercise that the cat got from climbing that tree a few times per day for how long the cat lived.

Unrelated, the cat was polydactyl.
Well don't just stand there. Let him in.
Since cats don't meow to talk to other cats, they probably stop by for a bit of a chat. Visiting kitty looks well fed so he probably has a place to go for food and shelter.
Bow chicka meow meow 💜
Romeow and Julicat
100% male on the tree, female inside.
Agreed he has chosen you and your cat let him in! Once chosen it can’t be undone
Knowing cats.. he's not saying hi. His climbing that tree to rub his freedom in the cats nose.
don't be shy, let them in
"Hi"
❤️

Help. Let me in!
I would’ve adopted that cat if it did that to my window every day qwq

Taunting the jailed cat
“Weep at your captivity as you view my freedom.”

“Fuck you, and I’ll see you tomorrow.”

“Okay, have a good one.”
Dude. This is so legit amazing ! It warms my cold heart.
Yo, you up?
Clarissa Explains It All and Sam vibe.
"House cat" just like institusionalized prisoners are "house people".

My friend had a window peeker too, but he used a ladder.
Poor baby in the snow
Feed the cat
Does it have a home? Or is it just trying to say adopt me.
I know that HI, comes from behind.

Did you neuter your cat?

“No worries, I’ll come check up on you tomorrow yeah? I’ll bring you a present” 

“Awesome, but no more dead mice next time please.”

House cat looks like mine! Do you know what kind of breed it is?
And that's how the perfect love story began..
I've had cats my whole life and is this cat coming to say hi or haha you're locked inside and I'm on a telephone post. There's a reason we refer to them as Tiny lovable assholes
Quarantine be like

Why does the tree cat talk and sound like Pepé Le Pew in my head?
Love is love
...They planning something
That cat buff asf
Hello, we've been trying to reach your human about their cars extended warranty.
I feel like this has meme potential. The outside cat could be an essential worker and the inside cat could be a celebrity saying “we’re all in this together!”
"This pole is mine, too"
Why not let him in?
We have a cat that shows up on our back porch to say hello practically every day. Unfortunately our house cat is very territorial and tries to scare him off, so no cute moments like this :(
DARLING IN THE FRANXX MOMENT
Beautiful and adorable ❤️
Get this man a girlfriend !
Rrawrpunzel, Rrawrpunzel: come on down and chase this hare with me!
Sounds like you should bring him in
i would install a plank to the tree, let the little guy in to hang out then go back home.

My cat looks very similar to your house cat. Is it also a ragdoll?
Let him/her in

Why not try letting the house cat out to enjoy itself . Selfish owners
'U want some fuq?'
Romeo and Juliet. <3
That’s sweet! Probably curious about each other’s worlds and wishing they could hang out though.
It’s love~
So cute!!
Tree hugger
Adorable!
Let it inside
Looks so sad...
“You think you’re better than me because you live in a house? Also can you ask your human to come out and help me down this tree.”
I wish you all a good day 😁
The challenge has been made, now it's a waiting game for the battle
Romeo and Juliet
“Hey Nikita is it cold,

In your little cooooorner of the world”

*Cat with USSR outfit and deportation book walks up and gives them both a stern look*

“.........AND IF THERE EVER COMES A TIME, 

HUMANS AND GAAAATES NO LONGER HOLD YOU IN”
It's climbing the tree because it wants you to let it in. Stop feeding it if you want it to stop
Cat on tree : "Hey Juliet ! My love !! "

Cat on room : " Romeooo !!! "
When they ask for the definition of love , show them this photo
BEAT HUGG

Cat is jacked, yo.
"Ay bby wan sum fuk?"
Bill... we’re still working on the plan to get you out of there. You’ll need to hang tight a little longer. I’ll be back tomorrow with another update.
Ahhh Kittie romance!
He climbs to ask "Wher are your balls Frank? What happened to them?"
But if there were no window, would they be friend or foe?
O Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name,
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I’ll no longer be a Catulet.
“Ha, you still enslaved!”
Let it in !!
Princess and the Paw-per
The white cat in da house shows TV news about Capitolia right now!
Usopp is back with another adventure to share
I want a love story like this or nothing
Must be a Siamese thing. Cats would do the same to mine.
Plot twist: the apartment is on the 32nd floor.
Awwww 🥰
Wat doing?
Let in me in, let's chill
Then one day, when the cat climbs the tree your cat won't be there, not the next day either, or the day after 😥😭
Reminds me of Mooch & Shnelly lol
More like come out fucker and fight me this is my territory
If you were in Golden Co, I'd say that's my parents cat, but all orange marmalades look alike lol
Just Brick up the window
Ragdoll, mines a ragdoll as well. He loves to go outside but has next to no instincts so I have to put him on a leash.
That’s a pure and cute daily routine.  I also wear a long sleeve with a vest on top every winter like that visitor.  He’s very well taken care. 😻
Psst, let me in
woooow...
Meanwhile, your cat is thinking "ah, to be free...". Meanwhile you're thinking "Aw, that cat out there is going to die young".
Rapunzel..... Rapunzel....
🎶 How much is that moggy in the window? 🎶
House cats hooman needs to build a spot for outside kitty to sit on. It's all in my head, and it needs to come out. Can you see it too?
Let him in!
Outside cat taunting inside cat

Hey Ron, hey Billy
The Montmeows and the Catpulets
If this is your house, please let that cat in
"Check this out, can you do this inside your fancy home?"

"Yes, my humans bought me a tree to climb and I also don't have to freeze my ass off to do it."

"Fuck you Frank."
Humans should do this more.
My parents had an outside kitty visitor that would come to see their cat everyday too, but all he wanted to do was fight. So the two cats would hiss and scratch the window at each other and eventually it would go away until the next day.
This reminds me of my neighbor's cat, Butters. She was an outdoor cat, but the moment I opened the door and made eye contact with her, she scurries over and tries to see my cat who... Wasn't crazy about her, but Butters didn't care! I miss them both.
Cat1: So everything going as planned?
Cat2: Yes boss! We've got everything you asked, what's your next move?
Cat1: I'll just let my pet trust me more than we'll make em all pets our little humans.
Yeah, hi. More like, look at me, bitch.
I remember one of my cat's cat friend wondered into our house, and started eating his food too. I wish that cat came more often :(
Or fight me 🤣
Make a platform or something for that cat to stand on.
Cute
You should build a little platform for him to sit on so he doesnt have to cling to the tree to see his friend.
That’s dedication right there!
What type of cat is this?
Do for love... daily that is!
The kitty wants in to play!
That’s just the daily reminder of the whooping the soft indoor kitty will get if it ever ventures into outdoor kitty’s turf.
Let them meet please!!!!
You better take this cat in
They’re in love 🥺❤️
Or they're saying ,"Look! See! This is what a real cat does, Wimp! Come on out- I dare you!"
Adopt him!
wow! that is awesome.
Say hi? Yea right, he wants to beat him up for being treated better. 😂
Taunting him is more like it!
Awwww! I'm not even Human 💚👽,  and this is a cute impression of your fellow species you cohabit with,  are all "kitties" like this?
That cat looks awfully like my cat (the one outside)
Aw, let him in already!
It's over Catakin, I have the warm ground.
[I am a lineman for the countyyyyyy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxSarBcsKLU)
Hi friend! 😸

True love
Cats are indoor pets. This is a sad pic.
Is that a ragdoll inside?
I bet £100 it’s not every day. Prob happened once. Nice try OP 🤥
“ Singing the blues while the lady cats cry...”
"What are you doing out there?"


"What are you doing in there?"
He's not saying hi ! He's saying escape escape then you can come climb trees with me!
They are Romeo and Juliet 😍
I hope the outside one has a home otherwise I'm going to feel extremely sad
Let that cat in!
Cats are better then most ppl
He seems polite let him in 🐱
Are they friends or is it a threatening thing? lol
My cat would not be happy about this at all. She gets really mad when she sees another cat
House cat: "I have a boyfriend"
If I know cats. It is to fight.
One my cats was a complete ass that would love to parade up and down the glass door teasing the neighbor's cats locked in.
ADOPT HIM INSTANTLY IF GIVEN YHE CHAMCE

Romeowo and Juliet
Help that cat out with some food!
Nice
He is calling him "Sucker"!
Well Hello Old Chap!
This but an animated short
Legit demonstration of “if he wanted to he would”
Let him out!
“Look me, enjoying my total freedom outdoors!”

“Enjoy your shorter life expectancy, Mittens.”
Adopt the cat
Being a \`house cat\` must fucking suck enough, without this free range motherfucker coming and rubbing his nose in it every day.
"Hi Bill."

"Hi George."
Romeo and Mewliette
Social distancing. Good kitty.
Certainly if this is not a single occurrence and this happens every day there would be more pics and video of this happening.
Adopt him
Adopt :)
Just bring it in lol
Awww bring him inside it looks so cold out there 🥺
What are you waiting for adopt him : )
Adopt him already.
You better let that motherfucker in
instead of taking this picture to show to strangers, why not have a heart,
and adopt this loving affectionate cat into the warmth of your home?
Maybe let out the fucking cat
It must be a house cat too but an outdoor one. I don't think a cat can survive in such a cold environment.
Let him for Christ sake , he looks cold
All I see is your outdoor cat saying hi to your indoor cat. You should get him indoor so they can nap together!
Cats should be brought and kept indoors.
Cats don’t say hi
