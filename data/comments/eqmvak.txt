“You remember that time I did that thing?”


“It was hilarious!”
The original post from yesterday was uploaded by somebody else, but he is my cat and that post was taken down. If you want to see more of Chestnut, give him a follow on Instagram @prince.chestnut. 

Thank you all 😊
What a handsome fellow!
## "*And I replied, 'I hardly meow her.'*"
The second photo wigs me out. The cat is adorable, don't get me wrong, but it's like someone anthropomorphized it. All the typical happy cat elements are present, as well as virtually all the human one's as well.
As I was saying yesterday in the other post, He’s very photogenic and adorable ☻
I feel like this is a great meme, it just needs to be the other way around. Here's a couple examples from dadjokes and a cat joke I found...

Does it work?? I'm not good at memeing.

Here's a blank template for you to play with: https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/219248694/laughing-kitten
I'm gonna break into your house just to pet your cat
My cat does this as well after playing. Vet wonders if its a heart condition D:
Everyone is going on about how adorable Chester is, and they’re right. But I’m gonna be that person and just be in amazement that you managed to get him in such good lighting, posing in that way *and* took a good quality picture to boot! Working with cats is hard and you’re really talented! Keep it up 💜
Feline fine
“Guess what I did today? I took a shit in daddy’s bed!”
He is a handsome guy
I love this photo and am waiting for the commenter that says “this may look cute but that adorable smile is actually a sign of [deadly cat disease]”
Looks like he's panting. Should probably take him to the vet.
I actually chuckled.
That is one pretty kitty
That's the most gorgeous cat.
seems this cat was panting. not that good

**HAH!** ... you know that was hysterical, todd. don’t lie.

I've seen this picture like 10 times in the past 2 days with multiple people claiming this is their cat. WHO'S CAT IS THIS.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE JOKE WAS AND I LAUGHED LMAOO

OP,

Someone mentioned that kitties panting may not be a good sign.

Just wanted to make sure you considered to get Chestnut checked out if you feel like it warrants it.

He's a beautiful kitty - here's to many years together!!

Hip hip, hooray! :3
Isn’t this a repost?  Last time I saw this the title was something my cats reaction when I tell a joke vs when my dad told a joke.
Twinkle Twinkle, all you folk  
I'm the car - I told a joke.  
Was it funny as can be?  
I think so.  Teee hee hee hee.
Two wind turbines in a field, one turns to the other and asks "What kind of music are you into?" The second replies "Well, I'm a big metal fan".

He finally managed to tell it without laughing first.
I heard his joke and its not bad for a cat...
Awwww
That's a pretty animal
This was posted as "my cat makes a face like my dad after telling a joke" just mere hours ago.
This cat is perfect right now.
And then she said "who's the best kitty"
Not to be dramatic, but i would commit mass genocide for this cat.
Cute cat 🐈
Switch the two pictures around and insert joke; 

"The cats told the rabbit they were friendly but they were lion"
I wonder how many people actually own this cat.  Seems like quite a few so far and I predict the number will grow.
Cat tax paid in full. Thank you.

You should think about creating a subreddit for your cat.

Oml what breed is he he's adorable
Remember when you laid out those stupid traps to catch the mice and they didn't work so I had to do it?

This is adorably cute, but your caption makes it pure gold!

Remember how 5 minutes ago i wiped my shit on your carpet cause it got stuck on my butt hair? Good times.
Reverse the pics OP
Repoooooost
Aww what a cutie
So proud!! Such a cute kitty!!
Cat humor is different than human humor, so I imagine the jokes that are making this cat delighted are like the following:  


Q: "Wat do hooman call bed made of warm?"

A: "Laptop!!"

&#x200B;

Q: "Y did the hooman call the thing on desk a 'mouse'?"

A; "cuz hooman too slow to catch real mouse!!"

&#x200B;

Q: "Y do hooman paint their finger-claws?"

A: "Cuz their claws so bad, they just for decoration!"
IS THAT A BENGAL CAT???
What type of a cat is he???
What did the pirate say on his 80th birthday?
Aye....Matey

Omg just I want to kiss him

please tell me you're laughing...
I think I found a new favorite cat picture....
I hate that I'm allergic to the felines
Dad jokes are hilarious
This might be the first time I've ever seen a cat grin! Besides in Alice in Wonderland, of course!
What a beautiful coat he has
Then I told him "Khajiit has ware, if you have the coin."
What a ham!  LOL
r/catsmiles
So cute.
Your cat is one handsome son of a bitch! Regardless of gender.

Edit : I now see you used the male pronoun twice in the title. Yup. You sure did.
“ Haha classic “
I am proud of him too
This may be my favorite cat picture on the internet
69.9K, nice
My God that is beautiful ❤️
This reminds me of the pun dog meme except so much better
Beautiful kitty
Your cat is obviously panting. Take it to the vet!
Whose cat is this really? Same pic posted multiple times
Aww so cute!!❤❤❤🥰🥰🥰
What would a cat's favorite joke be? Probably something like "Haha, I just jumped off the cat tree and landed on your head!"
secretly the collar is on too tight
Awwww what a smile
He looks so velvety soft!
me after telling a shitty joke and trying to get my friends to laugh
He looks like he took a big ol rip from the cat nip
Chestnut is gorgeous!
Dear God that's a pretty cat😱
If we had one additional frame this could be the cat equivalent of the Husky meme
hes so cute!
Okay, but is he aware that he's a cat?
Amazingly Handsome Boy!
So cutttte
You have a funny looking kajiit there
If he did, in fact, tell a joke...

Which one did you think he told?
Can anyone name the breed??
This cat must be Michael Scott
So I sez to the guy
r/supermodelcats
"I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it, people like me."
This immediately made me think of the meme of Tom Cruise laughing:

That fool is handsome...
I bet my life it was funny as heck
Thats a funny looking cat.
That's one happy looking cat. You're doing something right.
This cat should do modeling
Funny
Funny
Not going to lie, I'm not a huge cat person (they don't seem to like me) but I love your cat
Why do Khajiit lick their butts?
If the Cats movie had looked like this, you all would have loved it.
Ahahaha! 

*Sigh*

So, anyways
What a photogenic cat!
How photogenic can u get?❤️
Little cutie

Cat : I have achieved comedy

Now that is funny.

I saved this picture to look at anytime I’m sad. Honestly after my cat he’s the cutest cat I’ve ever seen.
Looks like my father in law after a decent dad joke. Perfect.
God damn your cat is handsome
And what should we call the movie..."aristrocats"!!
I'm sure I saw this post somewhere...

OMG THAT'S SO CUTE ♡♡♡♡♡♡
I am just here to record my comments for posterity.

When people go to knowyourmeme to know about this meme, they will direct them to us.

I want them to see me.
1st Pic Kitteh: I ate all the catnip

Hooman:I just bought a new bag

2nd Pic Kitteh:Yeah
What type of cat is this? It's absolutely gorgeous! 🗿
Not to be dramatic but I would die for this cat
He’s cracking himself up! Pretty kitty
So gorgeous 😍😍
Wow, that is truly one of the best cat pictures I’ve ever seen.  Kudos my man
Can we just take a moment to thank whoever owns this cat for making it so happy

They raised it better than my parents raised me lmao
Lol, this is so cute.
So cute!@
This made me happy af
What a beauty.
He's grumpy cat's archnemesis.
Shiba neko?
Reminds me of The Grinch smirking. 

Hilarious
This is the expression Jason Bateman has in everything.
Good Time Charlie
Your cat looks like Michael when he did the Knock Knock jokes, Dwight took it too far and Jim stepped in with a Ding Dong joke.
r/mostinterestingcats
Rarely do I up vote cats. I'm a dog man and rarely upvote those either.

But damn that is a happy looking cat!

Have my up un with pleasure.
That is one handsome cat. 😍
Its literally moon moon
I bet it's a lame dad joke too
cant wait for the images to be reversed and for this to be on r/Cringetopia within about a week with some cringy, impact-font, unfunny, joke.

Bonus points if it gets to r/all
This gives me pause...
r/catswhoyell

Well more cats who cheekily talk somewhat loudly but still works
Is he panting? He’s either too hot or in pain

I hate being the buzzkill but I help run a cat rescue and it’s not normal for a cat to hang his mouth open like that. Somethings not right though, so get him to a vet if he’s still panting, and if he only does it when he’s too hot try to keep him cool
First picture : " So get this I pooped on the floor"
Second picture : " and my slave cleaned it"
"So I said 'You gotta be KITTEN me'!"
😂 this made my entire evening
How old is he? He looks so young and soft!
I am laughing out loud, here !  He is just ADORABLE.
REPOST
Looks like a feline Sterling Archer. He's laughing but everyone is looking at him like he's an idiot.
Or you know.. skooma
Awww, I've got a repost at home too, they're so adorable! ❤️
You lucky SOB. You got one of the good reincarnations. My dog used to be a cat. Not nearly as charming.

He is so cute
Tell me the joke puss!!! I wanna be that happy too 😸😸😸
How did you manage the timing? When I try to take a picture of dog that looks like she smiling, as soon as she sees the camera she stops
Master of genius cat his mood is creative.
Well, maybe he did :))
Hes gorgeous
Looks like one happy demon
haha....exactly...!!
I can tell thats a cat that has been playing so hard he pooped himself out and now he’s panting from being hot and tired.
"So I says, meow! Get it? Meow"
Damn this is the 1st time I have ever seen an over 100k upvotes post .

Beautiful cat. What kind of breed is he or her?🤗
Handsome boi

I need to know what’s the joke please
This just put such a smile on my face 😁 thank you for sharing!
What a beauty!
My dad after telling his favorite joke we’ve all heard 100 times!
He heard you call him your cat, but he knows he owns you. He thinks you're funny and cute.
He looks so luxuriously soff :3
That's the happiest looking cat I've ever seen. He must really like you.
I love him, he looks like a cartoon character.
Aside from being adorable, that looks like the softest kitty I've ever seen!
Finally some good f*cking camera quality! Your cat looks so fluffy and soft i cant even describe it.
I didn't know cats could smile like that.
Not your cat? I’ve seen that everywhere

Edit:that was posted today so definitely not yours , why you lying
You cat looks and acts like a doggo.
To me he looks stressed af.  Maybe it's the bell around his neck so he can never hide like cats like to do sometimes.
What was the joke?
Awwww
The second frame looks like he’s noticing that nobody gets the joke but him and it’s just precious
This gave me quite the chuckle. What a little hammy.
Well to be honest, it was a purrfect joke.
That's indeed a blessed smile, and you're blessed to have such a friend. Would you mind if I made this into a meme?
Hey mum! How do you describe my smile again? Oh? That’s right! ............that it’s purrrrfecr!
HAAAAAA-ha!
This is my Buddha face... you like it, right?
Classic Chestnut.

Very handsome fellow 😻
