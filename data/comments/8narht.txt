"Ummmm, hey there... So, like, my bowl is empty, just thought you should know. "
Haha you should frame this. 
The cat is probably like “Excuse me human, who are you and why are you in my sink”
“Just found out you have a cat.  I will need you to pay the monthly pet charge from
now on.”
My cat is a feeler. He loves to put his paw on people's body/head/arm whatever. When we had someone in fixing our electricity, he would just sit on the counter beside the man working with his paw on his head. The man just kept working.
Looks like a space shuttle. This could be good for /r/PhotoshopBattles 
You have to keep an eye on the workers   
I hope he is putting in an iron line for the drain. You know, a new Fe line.
Kitty is monitoring his work.
I've been staring at the "fingers" because they looked like... not fingers.
What was ~~ceiling~~ sink cat watching him doing?
"I'm glad you're here. My hooman isn't back yet and it's time for second breakfast." 
It puts the lotion in the basket

Cats are the creepiest kind of cute sometimes
"I see your problem right here!  You've got some weirdo mucking around beneath your sink!"

-Cat
There is almost nothing our cat loves more than handyfolks/repairfolks.  he helps, observes, checks them out, helps some more...
I once got my bathroom redone and the contractor doing the work nicknamed my cat "the inspector". 
Hes got someone to hand him tools
The last image he saw before losing his hand to the disposal the cat turned on. 
superrrrrrrrrvising 
"Stupid human, that's not how you refit a  garbage disposal!"
Sign of a nice landlord. 
What’s the best way for me to shamelessly plug his Instagram, @ArcherTheAdventureCat? 
Whoa, your landlord is a cat? How did you arrange that?
Supurrvisor
I always wondered what lived down the drippy drink hole 🕳 
this is an amazing picture. i fucking love cats.
I hope you don't mind, I'm going to knock this screwdriver down this hole.

Actually, that's not true. I don't care at all whether you mind.
Poor cat thought it was a humongous mole rat. 
What a cool landlord. Mine is dumb as hell. He just replaced our 2 broken wall unit ACs with window units. They keep shutting off/not cooling and showing an error message, but he says it's because we have one of the bedroom doors closed. ? Also wants me to just leave them running because "they'll turn on eventually". Sigh. 
Can confirm, I work under sinks ALOT and more often then not the tenants cat lays on my chest and watches me work or gets in the sink or sharpens it’s claws on my tool bag. 
thats a weird ass angle for a hand
It takes one expert to solve the problem and two to take picture of other.
Hey bud, everything ok down there ?
The last thing you ever see.....

"Here's a list of the top 10 photos taken, before tragedy struck". 
Should get this enlarged and put on your bedroom ceiling. That way, you can freak out anyone that you manage to ba-doink in the future
I remember once how when i lived at my first apartment, 18 years old immediately out of high school, and i didn't have many friends so i bought a cat. And he was the biggest asshole ever. One day i locked myself out of the apartment and i had this little table right next to my door and the peephole on the door allowed me to vaguely see the eye behind it. I could make out the green little slit of that fuckers eye watching me suffer outside. Kind of like this lol. 
A landlord that fixes things congrats 
"We don't own a cat!"
That episode of Hannibal when he looks down on the killer from the roof. Especially Will's vision version with Hannibal being that demon-deer. Can't find a pic.
What's it like having a landlord that knows compassion?
Thats a total "who is you" look lol
“It rubs the lotion on its skin”
Your landlord is a cat? 
'What are you doing to my parents' sink? And are you going to feed me? And why are you here when they aren't? And are you going to feed me?' Cat, probably.
Fake. Everyone knows landlords don't help you fix anything. 
This by far has to be the most, funny, true to life adorable frikkkin picture I've ever seen lol... Coming from a crazy cat lady 😜
You have a VERY cool landlord....this is a good relationship,,,
would you like some chips, soda?
Our cats would make great friends (my cat is the toilet cat) 
Reminds me a bit of the James Bond intro from the thumbnail.

*Felicense to Kill*.

So stinkin’ cute!
In Ontario, you can't refuse to rent to someone who has a pet.
RIP OP’s landlord. That’s the face of a killer getting ready to attack. 
Cleaning up the bloody mess your cat left after that must've been hell
Please frame this. Classic.
Landlord: “Ah yes, I see the problem. You have a human stuck in the drain.”
“Hello there!”
What a great landlord 😂
"Hey. What ya doing down there?"
“We ALL float up here!”
GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM(CAT)...
Let's hope this cat hasn't seen gifs of other cats turning on faucets or else OP's landlord is gonna have a bad time 
"So, I'll be adding the pet deposit on to next month's rent."
Now you're in the sinken place! 
Cat: "So you're the one making all those loud noises when they flip the switch."
A new meme is born!

"Human, I'd like to ask you a few questions'
Your landlord is awesome!
Something tells me thats the last moment of his life.
Best cat picture ever posted!
Secretly that cat is wishing there was a garbage disposal nearby.
Long live the king 
Seems like you have a pleasant landlord. 
You’ll replace your eyeball if that cat sinks its paw down dat hol. 
"before you die you see the ring"
The supervisor is clearly making sure that the minion is working hard enough. 
Dang, too bad the cat is out of focus.

Wow everyone talking about deposits and pet charges. I got lucky, it’s fifty dollars extra for my and my gfs three dogs. And that’s not each, that’s a flat rate. 
"I have caught you in my trap dumb hooman. " 
Ah, I found your problem. THERE'S A FUCKING CAT IN YOUR SINK.
As it was stated in this type box "what are your thoughts?"
Really that's cool, my landlord served me an eviction notice. 
"Tonight, you"
Haha looks like my sisters cat. Also always an up vote for a victim!
Who else heard James Bond theme
Goodbye Mr. Bond.
Good to see the supervisor is making sure everything is correct.
The last thing you see before the young Khajiit fulfills his first Dark Brotherhood contract 
Hopefully it's a pet friendly rental. lol
this view from the space station proves once and for all that the earth is definitely cat. 
And this is how you discovered the cat was using the sink as a litter box
Cat foreman, on the job!
"Human, do you need assistance?"
Plumbing cat is watching you renovate.
"why is the hooman down the water hole?"
The money Skylar. .....WHERE IS IT?
WAT DOING?
"Put the fucking lotion in the basket!!"
At least he isn't showing Satan's starfish as he prepares to put that hole to use.
we all float down here
There is some real seriousness in his look
My landlord doesn’t understand english and makes me jump hoops to replace my lightbulbs.
*turns on disposal*
I always hate it when people watch me work. 
This is not what you were hired for Hooman. Basic to training with you
"Excuse me. Please return the mouse I put down there last night. K thanks!"
I bet he's glad it's not the other end of the cat instead 
It looks like the cat is looking out the window of a space station.
This is some Wes Anderson shit.
Removes one trap and finds himself staring into another.
It's almost as if the cat's saying:

*"My mom said you would be replacing the sink, but if it's just the garbage disposal, you should be outta here in like 20 minutes, yeah?"*
"Look I don't know who the fuck you are but i'm hungry and you're capable of feeding me."
I wish my landlord was a cat
/r/catsinsinks
"You're not my regular servant."
Now, THAT is a supervisor!
“You can’t fool me, hooman. I know what you’re doing and I do NOT approve.”
Must be nice having a landlord that allows cats.
What you don’t see is our cat in question, Captain Kibbles, casually pushing the pot of boiling spaghetti water into the sink.

All night, every post I click. it's that cat looking at me 
It puts the lotion on its skin
She's checking to make sure the staff are maintaining her kingdom in accordance with her tastes. 
*I see you have found the way down the gutter where you belong human*
"Well... There's your problem. You have another human under your sink! That can't be good..."
They replaced your sink with a cat?!?
"It rubs the lotion on it's skin

Or else it gets the hose again."
as the paw moves to the garbage disposal switch...... finds that it's off.... slowly pulls out of frame..... 
And you thought, "Hey, Im just going to steal the landlord's karma."
Its like a poster for some dystopian movie where people are enslaved and penned by their cat overlords. Just needs some more grit.
“I can see hoomans now the drain is gone”
Whatcha dooooin
Can someone photoshop this already with the opening scene from James Bond? 
I like your landlord.
Since I have you down there, let me talk to you about this pet policy
excuse me, wtf are you doing?
We aren’t allowed under the sink, guy. Get out before mom sees you!
"Oh hey there! Need help? On sec, let me just turn on the water for ya....yeah there ya go."
"Whatya doing in there human? Repairing my automated waterfall?"
... Soon.
“… ‘sup.”
As a European this "our landlord fixes stuff in our apartment while we're not home" concept seems so foreign.

I'd never let some guy I hardly know into my apartment without me being there.

And the apartments are usually rented empty so whatever sink is in there is mine and my responsibility.

And the cat definitely looks like it has the same thoughts going through its head at that moment.
Ground control to major Tomcat.
Dogs are better than cats. 
Why dont you frame it on ceiling or something? ;D
“You’re not the feeder?”
You're best friend in the whole world !
Well...you're screwed.  You're going to have to pay your pet deposit now.

The trick is finding a landlord who needs a cat inside for the right reasons......

No pet rent and no mice for the two  years I’ve lived here. 
He was making sure they were doing their job right lol. 
Your landlord is a cat?
That's where he put the first camera.
Just a heads up I think your landlord is a cat...

Looks like one of mine.  Going by my personal experience, that expression indicates a thought process to the effect of something like, "uh, WTF is going on here?  Is this something I need to know about?  Has it even been authorized?  Do I have grounds to freak the fuck out?"
This is typical cat.
