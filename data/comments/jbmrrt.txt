Hey, Cameraman, get over here. I‚Äôm gonna lick you, too!!!!
I CAN DO TIPPY TAPS NOW!
Thank you for posting this. I could feel his happiness and excitement so much.
The immortal ones have bestowed upon me new legs. Their power is infinite. 

-the dog, probably
The last time I truly cried was when we put a fence up in our backyard and our rescue mutt went out in his new "world" and just ran around like crazy being off-leash outside for the first time.  I knew right away it was worth every dollar.  Dogs man... sheesh.  I'd later shovel a 8-foot wide path around the entire thing so he could do his daily security check of the premises.  We lost him about this time last year, after 14 great years, but man did I love that guy!
Please tell me hes called lieutenant Dan?
‚ÄúWe can rebuild him, we have the technology......the Six Million Dollar doggo!‚Äù
RIP eardrums Jesus fuck
The tail wagging gets anymore faster and my man's gonna start flying.
The story is heartbreaking.  The neighbour chopped the dogs legs off for chewing their shoes even after the owner offered to pay.  The dog ended up with the person who runs the shelter who also has a prosthesis.  The dog is called kola or cola
The lick at the end got me, he's a very happy good boy
Fucking loud audio warning, woah there!
a volume warning would have been GREAT by the way my fucking ears
this is the best video ive ever seen in my life
Maybe some anti slip rubber soles?
No youre crying!!
You can totally tell he's trying to put his front legs up on them. Soon he'll figure out the right amount of effort to put from his shoulders to actually do that. It's going to be awesome!
This really should have come with an audio warning.. my eardrums just exploded üòÇüò©

We don't deserve dogs
Just so happens that I know that dog (Cola).  He's incredibly happy and affectionate and I've been lucky enough to give him a cuddle on more than one occasion.

He still has those legs but, last year, he was fitted with more hi-tech, custom prosthetics.

He gets taken for a run on the beach, twice a day, every day and is living a very happy life.
So happy! I love it when he just runs at the camera like he is excited to see everyone and be able to walk around!
Loved that part at the end when he ate the camera :) thanks for sharing this it made my day
The tail wagging kisses. Yes.
Those legs look like aigis's legs from persona 3
I was having a bad day. This certainly helped!
When I was but a young'un, we had a Dalmatian who was way too fearless. 

One day when me and my father got home the damn idiot excitedly jumped down half the length of our (12 steps) staircase. Broke his wrist.

My parents took him to the vet, where they learned the ankle was destroyed beyond repair.   
The only thing they could do was stiffen the wrist.

Ridiculously expensive, but my parents did it. 

The result was something very similar to this dog'a prosthetics.   

All this to say, that fella is gonna have a hell of a time getting up and down stairs.   
But I'm so glad my parents gave him a few more years, and I'm so happy to see this fella get such a massive body to his enjoyment of life. He'll be able to run and play for real again!

Our dog would later die of cancer still fairly young. Brain tumor. He became aggressive towards the end, especially towards me for some reason.   
He was always a good boy though. Always.

His name was Spike.   
My sister named him. She won't admit it, but I'm 90% certain she named him after the coolest vampire ever.
MY EARS WHAT DID I DO TOO YOU! T_T
Lt. Dawg!  You Got Legs!
Happy for doggo!
Why does this dog look like Richard Gere?
 Run free, baby! <3
Lt. Dan you got new legs!
This is lovely, but he seems to slip a bit.  Slap some slip resistant pads onto those bad boys and pupper is good to go.
Heart warming
I like how dogs just don‚Äôt give a fuck what it looks like. They‚Äôre more concerned on the function it allows.

Dogs are so amazingly resilient. Mine just had her front leg amputated a few days ago and she‚Äôs doing better than we ever expected.
Sometimes we do deserve dogs.
Dogs are the best. They bring out the best in people and cheer me up after a really bad day. I wish they lived longer. Seems like yesterday I got my Ali. She is 14 now and has dementia and other old age issues. I don‚Äôt want to let her go but I know I have to do that soon. It‚Äôs about her not me.

He so happy! Do those legs have rubber pads or something at the bottom to stop him slipping around? Cause I could imagine that would be an issue.
The other animals still in their cage: Nice. Now either let me out or let me sleep.
Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology. We have the capability to build the world‚Äôs first bionic dog. This will be that dog. Better than he was before. Better, stronger, faster.
I love dogs they always seem to be happy no matter what
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Look at the happy boi!
Thats enough to make the heart sing.
What's the only thing happier than a 3 legged dog? A 4 legged dog.

Heard this a while ago. It's really saying that there's no gap in hapiness between a 4 and 3 legged dog like you would see in a human with 1 arm instead of two. Dogs just live thier lives (of course we don't really know if they feel sad over the loss).
This made my day.
This straight up made me cry.
God damn it dogs are incredible. I‚Äôm writing this with my 6 month old spaniel snoring in my lap and I‚Äôm all mushy inside and have forgotten what day of the week it is. I love him that much that when I found out I‚Äôm allergic to dogs (after having a reaction to him) I said ‚Äúfuck it, guess I‚Äôm gonna sneeze a lot then. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù He‚Äôs awesome. This dog is awesome. Dogs are awesome.
Woaah Thanks! So sweet!
Oh, and thank you too, camera man! (Slurp)
five bucks says you smiled at this video when the dog came at the camera - i sure as hell did
If that dog isn't named Lieutenant Dan a serious opportunity has been lost to mankind.
this may be the greatest thing ive ever seen on the internet.
Man I really wish I could give this an award or 5
‚ÄúWho‚Äôs a good boy?  Me!‚Äú
That puppy was showing his genuine gratitude to those kind hearted folks that made it possible for him to do so. Dogs teach us soo much about how we should treat one another, he absolutely insists on having a good day no matter what! Watching joy like that is the best kind of encouragement there is!
Love this! Receives two new front legs, less than 10 seconds later, now let me try jumping haha!
At first I was like, "I wish the resources to make that went to a poor human child who needs a new leg or arm." But then I remembered I'm gay. And by gay law I'm required to love all dogs an irrational amount. 

So yay puppy!
Something tells me this dog is always happy.

This is what we should be doing with our big brains.
Dogs do a headshake as a way of saying 'its okay', she was so excited, she just wanted to go out and run.

Won't his limbs be rubbed raw and sore though? Do they make something to help with that?
Anyone know what kind of dog this is?
Ok stupid question. Assuming the dog was born without legs (which could be false), how does it even grasp the concept of prosthetic legs? Even if it lost its legs to an injury, I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs able to tie 2 and 2 together to see that these things are helping him walk.  Dogs are so smart I love them so much.

What is that ‚Äúshaking‚Äù thing dogs do (at 00:31)?  My little guy does that sometimes before we go for a walk, so I always associate it with him being happy.  But is there a name?  A reason?
Love this good boy!!!

Just a friendly reminder....for anyone who believes shelter dogs are "damaged beyond repair" or wonders why shelter dogs are so distressed...did you hear that high pitched constant barking? Well, multiply it by 10 or 20 or 50 and play it on a 24/7 loop. That is the life of a shelter dog on top of being confused (and possibly heartbroken) about how they ended up at the shelter in the first place. After a couple weeks or months of decompression in a new, stable home and maybe a little training if necessary almost all shelter can become wonderful well adjusted pets!
Beautiful
Most humans are garbage. But it‚Äôs nice to see that some actually do care and help animals in need.
in a slightly denser atmosphere with a slightly lower gravity this tail would create enough lift to allow this dog take off

I wonder... if a dog is a natural chewer, would they try to chew on their prostheses, or would they realize "Hey, I need these to walk properly," and avoid doing that?

Like doggos ain‚Äôt as smart as humans, and they don‚Äôt have as complex emotions. Would it be possible that he was perfectly happy before and now he just moves in a different way, while being as excited as he has always been because he‚Äôs receiving attention from many people in the room?

Or does he understand the implications of being able to run again and displace himself with such doggo grace and his happy about it?
Ugh yappy one in the background
I am more of a cat person, but WOW this is adorable, and I thought dogs were kinda meh.
Panting + ears back = nervous anxiety, not happiness

Please stop deliberately hurting animals, or at least admit that it‚Äôs a problem.
