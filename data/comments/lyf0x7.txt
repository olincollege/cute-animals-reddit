The legendary one leg pose it‚Äôs unbeatable
No wonder the kid was completely unbothered having that move under his sleeve.
The self-applause at the end! Such a power move. The boy is his own hype man.
I love how little man is soaking it all in like a sponge
I like how everyone is nice to the kid. I remember when big people were nice to me when I was little and it meant the world.
The contrast between the modern clothes and the old looking stonework is interesting.
Love this
Awww that little foot!!!
How cool is it that Hip Hop culture has gone from the Bronx projects all the way to being a global force of positivity.

Kid got served. Hope he's ok
I am now aware that I am woefully behind on preparing my children for future dance offs.
He didn‚Äôt have to hold it on them like that. That was just nasty!
Sick moves
The saying is that in order to get good at something you gotta suck at it first
Man I find it just awesome how far hip hop has made it in the world. So wholesome. Hit em with that stanky leg.
He came at them with the dada-ist style which totally threw them off their game.

B-boy baby wins.
The Scorpion move. Check and Mate!
[You just got served!](https://youtu.be/4VfRfVhgbfk)
He blew them away with the fire hydrant!
My 3 year old girl does that move as well lol thinks she's the fucking shit haha
Her: *DADDY, LOOOK* 
Me: *WOW BABE, that's hella cool, great job*
Her: *Yea, I do that sometimes* proceeds to hair flip lol

Little guy wanted all 3 of them to go before he destroyed them
I thought he was gonna kick that guy in the balls
Those guys are lowkey so wholesome
Those three got served worse than randy marsh
Killed them in ONE MOVE. This kid is SAVAGE.

I think the adults won this one. They had more elaborate looking moves.
Damn I was hoping the little kid would like start spinning on his head or something..
I‚Äôve got something in my front pocket, for youuuu üé∂
It‚Äôs sad to see that in the world we live in, gangs are now targeting children.
I thought the little man was gonna loose but then he hit them with his secret move the Peking Duck, and now he's a living legend.
Little man for the win!! This was just too dang cute and mande me grin from ear to ear.

love how everyone said ‚ÄòOOOOO‚Äô
Holy shit they got served!
So wholesome
You know, Reddit s been pretty damn wild as of late. I was actually expecting this little kid to start busting crazy moves.
Hit em with the scorpion
He slayed them!!!!
sick moves
So cute
The setting would make a pretty good Street Fighter stage.
He destroyed those fools
you got served
He fuckin killed them.
That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the final straw. Imma start B-boying again. That‚Äôs too adorable.
I was kind of hoping for them to all fall over backwards after they got served.
"I shall call you... Half Squat."
Terrible audience, asked to be clapping I would give him a standing ooohh yeeah

Lmao. That self applause in the end!
OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
He killed them with the scorpion.
Crouching baby hidden scorpion
Awww so cute!
Super
Every journey begins with a single step.
His movements are so precise, it looks like hes not moving his body at all!
That kiddo SLAYED!
Of course, they had to let him win. Grandma was already ready in the background with the shoe.
This was so cute my tubes almost untied themselves.
Am I the only one who excepted him to drop some heavy shit ? He still won imo
That clap at the end tho!!! ü§£ü§£
This has essentially made my day and I‚Äôm so glad it popped up in my recommended feed
Damn. They just got served
Anyone know the name of the first song?
They got SERVED!!!
He absolutely deleted them.
What song is this?
That is one patient little kid! Both of mine at that age (one who still is) would've been bouncing around at the very least, while waiting for their turn.
As soon as he lifted that foot off the ground it was over
The part that made me laugh the most was how perfectly fucking still that kid stood when they were dancing around him. Priceless
‚ÄúOoooooooooo‚Äù is universal.
Fuckin slaughtered.
I LAUGHED SO LOUD AND HARD SOMEONE CAME IN FROM THE OTHER ROOM!!!!
You got served sucka
The fact that those boys did that to include the baby....there's some good boys right there.  I'd be so proud if I was their momma.
Everyone.  Everyone in that contest is a winner.
How adorable they all are.‚ù§Ô∏è
That kid got fucking rolled.  Why‚Äôs he even going up against those three.  What a fool.
It's easy to say who won. All of them. Everyone there had a better day because of this dance off, they're all winners.
I kept waiting for someone to accidentally punt the child in the face but this was much better
This is the best thing. The best thing ive seen all week. This is it.
The little clap üòç
I love this specific genre of video. Adults sharing their talent and love of something with kids and hyping them up. So lovely
Okay but what y'all fail to realize is, not only did lil man stunt on them. He even said to himself, as he was walking up to accept their challenge, "Yo, I'm not trying to disrespect them too bad. Damn, which move can I pull?"

He had to take it easy on em. Lil man gave them a lesson in style and mercy. 

GOAT.
Cutie. Thought he was gonna kick that guy in the balls though for a sec
dudes: heres what we can do \*shows moves:  


kid: heres what i can do \*lifts leg while being on hands\*  


everyone in the world: WOOOOOO!!!!!!! \*claping super hard\*
several questions

1. What

2. who is filming

3. how did we get to this situation

4. why is this small child more talented than me
The adults won clearly
Not gonna lie.

I was fully expecting that little kid to go all "Yoda at the end of *Attack of the Clones*" with dance moves.
Nah fuck that they clowned on the baby, the baby didn‚Äôt even do anything
Yeah, not the kid, he got annihilated.
yeah that kid was shit. got absolutely clowned on. hope he learns from this.
Yo that baby got straight destroyed!
Omgggg this is so wholesome and cute
I dont care for kids too much but this kid made me love him
Whispering to myself "Yay!!!"
He‚Äôs like a young Jason Mendoza.
Damn, they just served that kid. Heartless bastards
his performance fucking sucked
Cringed so hard had to skip everything until the kid did something, and then they did something even cringier.
That was fuckn garbage that baby lost 0/10 from me
lol this is adorable‚Ä¶¬†that "oooooo" was so cute
Dropped the Scorpion Technique on ‚Äòem, FTW!!!
Blue pants won. That kid was garbage. No soul, no skill. 1/10
The adults really rekt that kid. He's gotta step up.

This reminds me of pokemon when your just chilling and people come to challenge you
When the kid came rushing up, I expected him to kick the men in the balls.
amazing rock steady
I thought this was 3rd Strike music at first.
This is how you stunt on your enemies.
üòç
He's just going to hit them with the Scorpion and destroy their pride. No remorse.

My man.
so adorable lol
Most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen in a while
Not the kid that‚Äôs for sure
I was really expecting him to just go off.
Lmao love the 1 move
That kids is nuts!
Hello 911, I would like to report 3 murders. Yes they were the punks who challenged the kid to Dance off
Such a cute little boy
THE FORBIDDEN SCORPION MOVE!!!
I don‚Äôt know why my expectations were higher given this kid looks like he only learned to walk within the past 2 months. I think the internet has distorted my sense of human capabilities.
Toddler: So the first two dudes were easy but I really had to pull out the moves for the third dude.
"Why are you break dancing at a staring contest?"
omg i love him
Call that kid The Rock, he‚Äôs the scorpion king
It looks like an old school JRPG battle.
My little sister used to pull this move when she was a baby. No she didnt turn into a breakdancer.
Bro this little guy needs to chill. Just relentlessly destroying these dudes. Every move a power move.
That house is rad.
A LEG IN THE AIR! He didn‚Äôt have to end them like that damn

I say this having spent a couple of hours last weekend examining the finer points of dry vs damp vs wet sand w my little nephew last weekend - pretty sure I would have needed to show ID to buy booze afterwards.

That pose the short one did takes years of practice and you have to talk to Red Man from the Killer Bee's just to get into the Hip-hop Dojo that is in a Crypt under a used record store in Queens.
