But it looks so soft
[deleted]
The ones that look like towels are actually tailless cats facing the other direction.
Strange, I gave it an 11/10
It's a cooling rack for freshly baked loaves...
Steelers nation. THE TERRIBLE TOWEL.
i don‚Äôt see a yellow towel tho
Nice camouflage
r/catswithjobs
Don't use the side with the pink asterisk to wipe your face... Just saying.
r/catloaf
Eco friendly though, throw it on the ground when you‚Äôre done and it dries itself off and puts itself back on the cabinet in mere hours.
Would use again.
Try not to use the towel with the eyes that pierce your very soul
That's not a towel.  That's an organic mouse trap with realistic motor sound and a convenient carrying handle. It also doubles as a self tracking solar collector, but there's some problems with transferring the heat gained to water.
I counted repost 90076 by pixels.

One of these things is not like the others.
[You're a towel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NO8lnC7u3w)
Ok then.....*still grabs, and rubs face with vigorously
Also seems to have a crazy amount of lint...
I don't know, I have the same brand. It seems to come with a built in heating and purring function.
Also repels water.
Matches other towel colors.  Looks cute.  Do not disturb.
Meowel
It is, however, self-drying.
How things go with my kids and our cat. They always say this while they pet him:

"Soft and squishy... soft and squishy... SHARP AND POINTY... SHARP AND POINTY!"

He will let you pet him for a while but then he will dig in his claws into your knee or try to bite your hand. Cute bugger.
As someone from pittsburgh, it's only terrible if it says Myron Cope
At least the color matches üòÅ‚ù§üòªü•∞
THE CAT! He found his calling from the Who's Line sketch
I would like a towel this terrible.
Omg. That chin chub and those foldy paws. I‚Äôm in love
But so fluffy!
I thought I was the only person that folds their towels like that
The towel has gained sentience
Doesn‚Äôt dry well, even more difficult to wash
Hes trying his best or should i say drying his best... sorry
Yep Amazon got it here next day but constantly tries to steal my Mac and Cheese and has destroyed my grundle. 3 stars.
I wouldnt try wringing this one out...
4 out of 10? thats a bit low.

I'd give it at least a 7 out of 10
7/10 with rice.
That towel dries just fine, just leaves hair all over your hand.
I would cuddle with that towel anytime
That towel looks like it would be a little scratchy....
+2 happiness
THE CAT!
Reminds me of that joke. 

Bear and rabbit shitting in the woods.
Bear looks at rabbit, Ask's rabbit.
Dose shit stick to your fur?
Rabbit says, no. I dont have that problem.
Bear says good. 
Bear picks up rabbit, wipes and walks away.
A million thread count. Very soft
Not the point of this post but I've been struggling on how to store towels until I saw this post. In all my stupidity, I've never realized that I can roll them up to save space instead of folding them like clothes.
I have to admit...I've used my cat as a towel before. She may not like it, but she's definitely absorbent.
Judgemental towel!
I give 10/10 very cuddly
Great towel. Cleans itself. Never runs out of threads no matter how many fell out. 10/10
I honestly thought this was a towel just folded really weird untill I saw the eyes
Now you just need a tabby towel.
But it got 4/10 so that‚Äôs not bad!
Mine licks all the water droplets from my ankles...
Matches the decor though
I tried to warm it up in the dryer first...big mistake.
Day 17. They still don‚Äôt suspect a thing
Your title is like an episode of Modern Family. I was like, "Wow, that's so clever and funny", but I didn't laugh out loud at all.
Gave 4 cuz it purrs.. Sometimes
Weird, I used one of these towels yesterday and they work really well. It is really hard to fully unroll it when you first get them though. You usually need scissors or a knife.
A forbidden floof.
But at least it licks itself clean.
Perfectly folded and it even meows. I‚Äôd love that towel! Lol! Too cute!
But it purrs
SNEAK 100
It‚Äôs laundry day and I‚Äôm gunna mess with human makes him think he haz one xtra towelzzzz....
And it judges you.
Mine always follows me and says a purrrrrrr sound also whenever I say but at least it only follows me when I say psppspsppspspspsppspspsppspspspsp tho.
This picture is so old...
Jesus. 

Look at that image quality. Maybe 15 reposts ago this image looked good
Lol, this is purfect.
Sinister face: fat bottom.
It‚Äôs a perfect plump shape. I‚Äôd give it a 4.00001/ 10
Haha üòÇ üòÇ
that cat is traumatized
Meows when I wipe my ass... 4/10
I bet with rice it‚Äôs an 8/10!
Terrible towels are black and gold..
But CUDDLY AF
 Terrible towel. Very scratchy. Does not dry well. 3/10

*purrrr*

... 4/10
How is it with rice?
That a very soft loaf.
Show of hands. How many of us have that exact IKEA trash can in our bathrooms?
Very fluffy tho
Cat towel: 4/10, Cat towel with rice: 7/10
You‚Äôre using it wrong. You‚Äôre supposed use the tongue! 10/10
Have you tried putting it in the washing machine without conditioner?    


^(joke, obviously. Washing machine wouldn't survive a cat attack.  Please, someone, think of the washing machines.)
Finally a towel that runs away from you unless you're about to feed it. The future is here people, the future is now!
Wtf is that toilet tho?
Very soft.  5/7.
What kind of toilet is that? Never seen one like it before.
That looks like a terrible way to start/end a day
but it vibrates comfortingly
Dry clean only.
r/catloaf
Cat loaf
[removed]
Towel with lots of features... It can talk and at the same time, you can call it... It will with you for a long time, if you have lots of love for it.
Must not have boys. That chrome bin would be a splat covered yellow colour.
Color match!
I remember seeing a comment on reddit explaining that if you're out of toilet paper and have a cat lying around, you could use it to wipe your ass since the cats clean themselves so pretty much you can clean whatever with them.
I disagree very cuddly. Excellent at everything o great kitty
That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a bath mat.
Picked up my girlfriend's towel, dried off, and left addicted to risky behavior and marb reds
Housekeeping did a shitty job folding my towel, got eviscerated. 1 star
Ah there‚Äôs your problem. You don‚Äôt use it like you would a traditional towel. This towel is automatic. Just sit back and let it use its tongue mechanism to get the job done.
r/AccidentalCamouflage
Leaves a lot of fluff.
Little known fact. Towels are one of the most common causes of dry skin.
"very scratchy" lmao
But 10/10 good boy
Makes weird noises, feels soft yet makes me bleed at same time.
Why i have seen this picture before
It's self-cleaning, though!
You reposted this
the cats like "I AM A TOWEL HOOMAN DO NOT QUESTION ME"
I like that towel
Show me a price
#redditmarket
That face ü§£

‚ÄúHow dare you even contemplate using me as a towel. Shame on you human.‚Äù
Scary towel. Stares back at me. Also has weird tongue. I can't dry off if it licks back LOL
Will covwr you in musk and distain
But it vibrates.
SiCK fUcK tUrNS hELplEsS cAt iNto ToWeL
OMG what breed is he/she?
He knows you‚Äôre judging him and he doesn‚Äôt care

Cute af tho

He‚Äôs doing his fucking best okay
why does mine walk?
Is my reddit app not refreshing?
Lol. This is a darn repost.
Repost? And it get top?
Danger towel
How did this shitty quality (just tells you how much it's been copied) repost get 100k???
NUUU, HOOMAN, WAT R U DOING!?
Cleans itself though
Sneak 100
This is the quality content I want to see right when I open reddit.
Try it as a toilet paper maybe.
That towel looks very judgmental.
Does the repost bot work in this subreddit? I‚Äôve seen this picture before.
He's doing his best! Leave him alone
That‚Äôs a great spot!!
Of course he/she is talking about the white towel.
nice lives ; im jelly  
the luxurys\~
its the title that gets me
But with rice?
oh the chubby
Must be from ikea.
Doesn't wash well either...

https://youtu.be/_VfSl0iGAus
Weird question, does anyone else dry off their cats? Like when they just come in from the rain I'll grab a towel and rub them down?
That's not an authentic terrible towel, do not wave at passersby.
Towel gave me a vasectomy. 10/10 Would dry again
Wut cat breed is that?
But does gel well
Gets cute points though 11/10
That's the Steelers style, terrible towel!!
British shorthair? Boy?
10/10 would use again
Thought this was r/Steelers for a min
Verrrrry scratchy
Wait...
r/catloaf
Vibrating scratch towel in the shade argent..
Idk, I wipe with mine and rather enjoy it.
Awww
It‚Äôs good toilet paper though
Careful drying your back, the towel is scratchy!
Why is that toilet so weird? Genuinely curious
Haaaaa ha
Lol
Also poops.
it's not black and yellow... how's it terrible?
Mimmmsyyyyyyy!!!!
Whys mine always meow when i use
The towel fibers keep falling out
LETS GO STEELERS
But it matches the decor so well üòÜ
Why is the towel biting me
"Be careful the towel bites"
Also don't recommend doing the butt floss technique while drying off with that towel... 1/10 You're gonna have a bad time.
Looks perfectly absorbent to me.
I mean you used toilet paper so duh
This kitty appreciates a pretty color palet!
Dry level: 1
Cuteness: 9
Blep: 6
But how well does it absorb flavor?
It leaves fuzz on my wet skin.
Imagine this, your looking for your cat, but he is lying between the towels
4/10

7/10 with rice
These are my people, these are my friends...
Don‚Äôt disrespect the towel like that
I will gladly take that towel off your hands :)
r/cursedtowels
0/10 i needed to get stitches after using it
The kitty‚Äôs chonky rolls make it look more towely.
A Hydrophobic towel
At least your color scheme is nice.
r/perfectfit
I'm confident that cat wouldn't like be waved like a terrible towel jagoff
That towel is probably the most purfect.
The cat!

No, the cat‚Äôs already wet!
When you run out of toilet paper
HES TRYING HIS FUCKING BEST OKAY?
But he tries tho
*"there is a brown stain on that towel"*
No Kitty, you're a towel.
It folds itself neatly and puts itself away, though.

There's a lot to be said for that.
Sneak 100
Sweet loaf.
Bruh, that‚Äôs a loaf of bread. See it‚Äôs grey and moldy. Lol
Dont tell me you rubbed her with your ass
Strange, I found the towel to be strangely comforting. I'm considering getting a few more, perhaps in different colors. 12/10 would purchase again
something about the pittsburgh steelers
Purrfect fit
I just wanna give loves
and also poop alot
Give him a break, he's trying his hardest!
But it fits so perfectly on the shelf!
So pudgey üòç
I know this is about the cat but where did you get that cabinet?
But it is very cute. :D
Didn't work so well when I tried to dry my arse. I thought the long bit on the end would be help for the hard to reach places and between my toes the punctures in my skin on my guts say otherwise.
This image has been saved and reuploaded so many times it's starting to look distorted.
Look how soft they look!
He's doing his best!
Also covered with fur everywhere!
That is not a terrible towel, 0/10. Go Lers!
And Oy! The lint!!
Double Yoi!
Self cleaning though
I dont think its a good idea to wipe your naughty bits with it
The universe is a fuckin comedian, man.
Beauty!
'TIS BUT A CATOWEL!
Try a better dryer sheet.....üòπüòπüòπüòπ
Perfect loaf.
Camouflage level: cat
Must be a Pittsburgh Steelers fan too
Person that too the photo: i love my cat but I'm going to this anyway 

Cat: f*ck you
6/10 with rice
The cats face tho
Naughty loaf
Why do you keep the emergency toilet paper with your towels?
Wait, you use your cat as a towel?
But an AirBnB 5‚òÜ review
Self cleaning
Colour blends in nicely though.
Shhh, they are doing their vewt
Also difficult to unroll and make and makes a wet mess when you finally  manage to unfold it.
but he‚Äôs doing his best
He's doing his best okay
That towel better hope Renegade doesnt come on
chunky one
Imagine getting out the shower and u reach for the towel but it's a little heavier than u remember and its so soft, but u assume your just being weird and u go to dry off ur privates but then... oh no mr snuggle muffins? what are you doing down there!?!? Then u never can have kids.
You‚Äôre using it the wrong way you must first swipe down to up
r/repostsleuthbot
Fold ur towels heathen
So is this rooting for the Steelers or the Panthers? I'm confused...
Scratchy
The cat works great though!
Works great when the toilet paper is all used
Wait until you get to the crotch.
I‚Äôve seen this before.
That's a cat wtf op.    /s
With my cat that would definitely be a trap.
nice towel
She's doing her best. Leave her alone
hehehe
he‚Äôs trying his best okay?
This is why bed bath and beyond is going out of business...these fake towels aren‚Äôt trickin anyone
But the towel looks like a cat and it looks cute, so i'm giving it a 6/10
r/catloaf
I'll dry my balls with this one
My hands are always hairy after using it. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Cmon, no stars for the purr function?
I'm not very cat person but that cat is beautiful!
‚ÄúThe room was nice and clean but to my surprise the towel fought back‚Äù
The title made me think this was going to be a Pittsburgh Steelers post somehow
But can you unfold the cat?
Self cleaning, soft, but kind of stinky, and hungrier than others towels.
This person has incredibly low standards for towels.
Try running it through the washing machine
Same with the one I got at the Steeler‚Äôs game
I had that before, 2.3/10. Didn't return but also will not buy again
Lol
u/katydid4567
Awwwww so cute üòÇ
The title led me to beleive this was a steelers post until "4"

You take that back!

4/10 very crusty
How does it taste over rice?
This is so rude.
finally i just got out the bath and need to dry my ass
At least the towel takes pictures!
No you‚Äôre a towel
Trust me, it‚Äôs worse when they get mixed up in your toilet paperü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I don't trust cats. They observe you and you don't notice...
It's the best after Walmart burritos
My towel bit me today
Illusion +42
Actually took me a second to spot him
Looks just like my cat! And the same place he likes :-)
Smh
Would not reccomend
I would most definitely mistake him for a towel by accident lol
r/perfect_fit
I love the face. 

"Bruh. The fuck u starin at? U got a problem? Nothin to see here. Move along human"
If its terrible why rate it 4 instead of 0
Although remarkably absorbent, the common household cat retains only 2% of absorbed water when rubbed upon a human body.
This can increased to 12.4% by holding the cat at a 32 degree angle perpendicularly to the flow of the shower head.
My parents used to close their door to keep the cat out and one day I went in to shower and opened their cabinet doors only to find the cat on the towels. 


By closing their door they locked him in.
Good thing: it cleans itself
chumby
kinky
Once in my childhood i have an identical cat as the picture. The name of the cat was smoke. By destiny's joke, he jumped into a pit fire and run away so fast that we have never see the motherducker again. 
 Was a sad day, boys... Sad day.
Still get 4/10. One for each little pawpaw
I held it by the corners and shook it to unroll it, and it attacked me!
I like scratchy towels though
Lol
Terrible towel. Includes more than the normally expected level of biting for a towel. Am still wet.
Mine likes to sit in the towels and stare at me when I poop. That, or he will either sit in my pants that are around my ankles, or hop on the sink next to the toilet and demand head boops.
Yes, but what about the towel on the upper left end?
And the ends smell bad
I thought the terrible towels were a steelers thing
It sticks the nub-ends into the chubbins.  

Nubbins in da chubbins!!
I can't understand where the towel begins and the cat ends
How do people here not see that?
Did you stroke the spine first? Hagrid taught me that trick.
Ah, one of those hydrophobic towels I've been hearing about.
I wouldn't keep the towels there next to the toilet
Damn, I've seen this image from a while ago on here, if you're not the OP then you done stealed it.
Still 4/10? Slightly below average?
Which towel?
*bit my ballsack*
I love when cats put their paws under their body like that. Must be comfortable and warm!
But extremely fluffy tho , 10/10 would recommend anyway
This towel even licks ur face and dries it with its tail üòÑ
Now I know why my dog hates towels
Took me 2 minutes to find the cat
thats so fluffy i want that towel now
Terrible towel. Very scratchy. Does not dry well. Still 10/10 because I love her.
Towel cat - he purrs, vibrates and the most important he listen you when you are depressed
MOM: get me an towel please

Me: (taking the Cat)

Mom: I want to wash IT

Me: (after seeing the Cat get washed)Mom??
r/noahgettheboat
I think it deserves a better rating simply because it's a warm towel.
What about cuteness points? That has to count for something
/r/steelers 

> Terrible towel.

I think i saw it before 
But im not sure
First repost to get almost 100k upvotes
Nice to see my cat wasn't the only one who did this. She had a thing for cabinets and high shelving.
Resistance to use, injury may occur if attempted
it smells kinda fishy too...
DO NOT BULLY HIM!!!!
I‚Äôd make it work
6/10 with rice
Pretty generous rating.
This dude gained a shit ton of karma!
That cat is too fat
Leaves lint too.
üòÇ very scratchy hahaha
it scratchs your ass 0/10
I think you meant Toilet Paper
It also sometimes runs awayü§£

2.5/10
What. Breed of cat is this?
But it is very cute so 10/10 regardless
Scratchy towels are the worst yet the most beautiful.
Weird, I just saw this image on pinterest...

Also, my nickname in high school
Looks cute as Heck. Solid 7/10
Use the cat as a towel
It looks like a very comfy towel. 100% cotton?
