Mr. Rogers of dogs
That dog definitely found you weed brownies.

Edit: Thanks for 1k!

2nd Edit: WOW Thanks for my first Reddit gold!
I want to cuddle him!  So cute I can’t stand it!
am dog  - am old 

am very wise

the years have made

me realize

what matters most, 

in all you do

is someone who 

*Believes* in you . . .

it matters not

your pedigree -

no difference makes

to you or me

but find someone

who loves you, true

the way you are -

just 'you for you'

who no compares

you to the rest -

just someone who

loves You

the *Best*






This man did something wrong and is feeling guilty..

Such a dapper fella you’ve been fortunate enough to share this life with!👌

Your doggo is a perfect example of why I love golden retrievers. You know how dolphins likely had to evolve a sophisticated “language” of sounds and other bodily behaviors, because they lacked the muscles to communicate through facial gestures, resulting in their permanent “happy” face? Golden retrievers seem to have gotten all those facial muscles in addition to their beautiful faces. Golden’s can communicate so much with their eyes and ears, or even just a tilt of their head, but when they turn that smile on, nothing else seems to matter. They really do smile, and I melt every time I see one! I know I’m probably biased, but I really think, as far as overall best friend qualities go, (generally speaking) Golden Retrievers top every list! 

Thank you for sharing your older gentleman with us🥰
Omgosh. That smile!!
That face! 
This dog looks exactly like Patrick Stewart. This is the Patrick Stewart of dogs.
My heart just melted. I die happy seeing this. 
Omg I love you, old man. 
Somebody has had one too many Scooby Snacks.
Omg. May I hug him???
How high is your dog, op?
Omg pat him please 
Goldens have the sweetest smiles ever!
This vid reminds me of a quote from Futurama by a lovable robot. “Shut up baby I know it”
I see Joe Rogan’s dog finally did DMT. 
He's lived long enough to know, without a shred of doubt, that he is a good boy.
I was having a shitty day today but this right here man makes me happy. Look at that face. 
Shadow from Homeward Bound!

“Would you like a cup of tea”
ohhhh my god this makes me think of our old golden retriever orion. My mom was the principal of a preschool, and she took the dog to the school most days even though it probably wasn't allowed. All of the preschoolers knew orion and they would go into her office and pet him whenever they were passing by. When he was 15 though we were moving countries and the flight was gonna be too long for him to handle so we had to leave him with our friends. Sadly a couple of months ago he died and whenever i see a golden retriever i get really sad
He stoned as shit.
Oh my stars! I love him! Grew up with Goldie’s ☺️💙🐾
He looks like such a good boy! 
Looks like he got into the edibles. 
That might be the biggest smile on a dog ever
is it just me or does he look reaaaalllllyyyyyy happy (like he would had smoked weed.. if he would be a human)?
Bear in the Big Blue House
Damn it all.  I can't be mad at this sub anymore. Give your dog a treat.
Oh those winkies are so loving!! Bless this older gentleman and all those who get to pat and pet!
Falcor!!!
If this dog was a human, he'd be the cute old man who gives a quarter to a stranger's child for the gum ball machine. 
TIL I’m into older men. 
That dog is so happy 
Beautiful kindness, much love 
Aww. I’m in looove!!!
The only time my dog smiles that much is right before he barfs. 
I want to sip hot coco in front of an open fire and hear this man's stories.

Senior borko
Love the grey faces.

Peeeterr! :D
He looks like he has lots of wisdom.
Why does he look like Patrick Stewart?
That dog is either living his best life or he ate his owner’s edibles 45 minutes ago. 
I love those squinty dogs that see your outline and just kinda hope you're gonna pet them soon
He’s seen some life
Stoned doggo
Did you give him a hug afterwards? :)
He looks like he's going to tell me an adventure story.

He looks like a old man I worked with at whole foods named Stuart
This just made my day. Thank you so much for sharing the happiness!
That's the face my dog makes when she's gonna puke in the car.
😭 
Hey!!!!!! Too early to have the lights on.
He looks like he would give me some pepperidge farm cookies.
My dog makes that face! Usually when we come home after being gone longer than she expected. It's her stressed but happy we're back face.
OOOOOO, what a cute. I really laugh with him, he clearly does not have depression)))))
Any lady? 
Holy shit that dog is high

His owner told him the news today. A giant step closer to an orange explosion! Oh boy oh boy!
Just a beautiful Golden
Wow, he's got it all figured out!
In his mind, his tail is in full wag
My heart. 
This is the exact reason why I don't want a dog. They eventually get old and die and I can't handle that. 
He looks like he’s genuinely happy. What a big smile
Tell him he's a good boy and Pat dat head for me.
i love him so much i wanna scream
What a smile he has
Look at that smile!
this is a dog waiting to be told off for doing something they shouldnt have. Oh by the way i am not accusing the owner of mistreating the dog, I have had dogs that give me this look when they know iam about to tell them off and i have never raised a hand to any animal hell i have only ever hit a human once because this guy forced me to defend myself. so yeah very cute was just thinking when i saw it that that is the look of a dog anticipating a telling off
This dog looks like Owen Wilson
I love everything about him. 
best gif in a long time :)
Did someone get that dog high?
what a handsome guy aww
is he high?
I attended the global pet expo last year and a big thing on the rise was cbd or Marijuana infused dog treats. I saw a dog that had way too many "treats" and he looked just like this dog. 
he’s wise, he knows something we don’t 
Beauty!
What a dollbaby
I lub himb
This dog looks like he's gonna ruffle YOUR head...
When you walk in on your super baked friend 
What a sweet sweet babe. Melts my heart! 
This made me tear up some in memory of all of my old friends, to include a Golden named Max. He was such a good boy.
If that dog could talk, he'd sound like Grandpa Pickles.
When he smiles I just melt 😍😍
Why aren’t you touching him.  Please?
Omg, he is the most beautiful dog I've ever seen.
Yes, here, take my upvote

Put a hat on his head
My golden scrunches up his face and smiles exactly like this every day when I get home.  No matter how shitty my day at work had been—seeing that waiting for me at the top of the stairs made me forget it all for a minute or two.

Love ya Loki

Reminds me of Alan Alda smiling
Oh my gosh. This may be one of my favorite dog videos ever. There’s something so human about his expression. Just so calmly happy and content. I love him!
