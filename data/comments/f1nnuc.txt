He’s choosy with his nuts! Skipped right over option A
Do you find any use for the dried seed that he brings?
What a messy guest.
How’d you get that started?
Why his ears so floofy
This has been the best trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever
When I was little, my dad saw a baby squirrel who’s mother was hit by a car. The baby was still too little to last long on His own, so my dad brought him home. We named him Darryl and we were besties. When he got old enough my dad reintroduced him to the outdoors, but he would come back 3 times a day for peanut butter on crackers. I still miss my little buddy sometimes
Oh holy god if that ain’t the darn cutest squirrel ever!
Anyone else get seethingly jealous when they patted the squirrel? No? Just me then..
[deleted]
Who are you a Disney princess?
Give him extra tomorrow for the internet points
That's sweet!
Ah yes, the merchant
How do I sign up for this arrangement? 😆
This reminds me of the time I lost out at the chance to be the Penn State Squirrel Whisperer. 

One day, while walking with friends, I started clicking randomly at the squirrels running around campus. As soon as I started making the clicking noise, a few squirrels perked up. Before you know it, they are running towards me and running in circles and all of my friends are flipping the hell out.

So for the next week or so I decide to use my new Thornberry superpowers for personal amusement, when one day my roommate holds up the school’s newspaper. There’s an article about a girl who was befriending the campus squirrels and learned how to communicate with them. She made them newspaper hats. 

I will never forgive her or myself for her thievery of my destined legacy, and for her thinking to make the squirrel friends adorable little sailor hats. I can’t believe I didn’t think of that!

Guy comes in with some piddly, dried-up last minute gift idea in exchange for a sumptuous almond and hazelnut meal* and *then* has the gall to make an ungodly mess in your home! How uncouth!

*Edit: added the word meal because that’s what it is...a meal. A sumptuous almond and hazelnut meal.
This is a juvenile and what I can an "independent orphan". Would you please post a video of him actually eating? I ask this because I want to see if he was orphaned at an age old enough to have molars. A full set of teeth is critical for squirrel health, and the molars come in quite late in the squirrel's baby/juvie period of life. I think this one probably lost mom before all teeth were in, and that is very bad news for his prospects of survival.

This little one might not be able to survive long without some special nutritional supplementation, and nuts are not enough. Would you like to help him live and grow up? He will be friendly with you for the rest of his life if you do. If you don't then he will not last long.

Are you willing to make him some formula balls so that he can finish growing up and have a chance at health and a normal squirrel life? I will find the supplies and give instructions if you tell me your location.
I want one
Anyone else amazed how quickly it is mowing through that case? 

Squirrels are amazing
I have once again come to ask for your nuts.
[deleted]
"This just in, the first reported case of squirrel flu is confirmed..."
He looks like Kramer from Seinfeld. "Come on Jerry! Just take the seeds.. You've got plenty of nuts!!".
Little guy looking like Heihachi from Tekken
One time I asked my gf’s dad how he got the scars all over his hands.  He said, “I used to have a pet squirrel.”
EAR HAIRS GAME STRONG
PSA to anyone who wants to feel like a Disney princess too, squirrels do not hold their bladder. Urine simply dribbles out  bit at a time as the body produces it, so don't let them crawl on you or touch anything they crawled on.

Cute squirrel though
I like how he stops halfway to intensely look out the windows...
"Eh! Is that fucking Steve?!"
"Oi, not him" *nom*
It looks like he's putting the nut everywhere expect in his mouth hahahah

Or is he "peeling" it ?
Why is no one talking about the fact that OP is running a trap house for squirrels??
You'd be nuts to do business with this person!

I'll see myself out...
Wait, aren’t those like the evil squirrels killing all the redhead ones?
The squirrels in Boston Commons were the most friendly squirrel I’ve ever seen. My daughter brought a can of peanuts and they were climbing all over her. She loved it. I was kinda freaked out. Great trip. But I had to explain to my daughter what “Cheers” is....
Damn girl, the guy is tryna eat! Quit touching him.
My mom has some pretty smart little squirrels in her yard. She used to get a bit annoyed with them because they would constantly hang out in the bird feeders. Now, mind you, she had no problem with them eating the food, but they would sit on the feeder and scare away the birds. So she started watching how they would get into the yard. She figured out they came down a telephone pole and ran across that line into our yard then crawl down on of our trees. 

So she put a large plate form feeder into that tree and filled it with nuts and cereal and dried fruit and waited to see what they would do. Turns out that the squirrels LOVED their new feeder and would hang out there in the shade and eat. Eventually, after a year or so my mom was able to approach them while they were eating and hand them food. It’s been a few years now, and we think some of the squirrels she was feeding had babies and they taught their babies not to be afraid of my mom and I. So now we have 5-6 squirrels who will come visit us in the backyard during the day. We even have a cookie jar we keep nuts in so we can make sure we have treats for them.
A while ago I posted a video of me feeding a chipmunk and all I got was a bunch of comments saying that I shouldn’t feed animals but this guy feeds a squirrel and gets 60k upvotes
*gnom**gnom* DOG *gnom**gnom*
Awesome. My family and I had a similar deal with a few local squirrels from our neighbourhood when I was younger. We ended up with a group of 3 or 4 different squirrels that would visit regularly for peanuts. As time passed, we got them coming closer and closer to collect the nuts. Eventually they would take it from our hands. To the point where they would come inside the sliding door and grab some off the kitchen floor.

Eventually, our neighbour's asshole cat started hunting these squirrels and the fun stopped.
How do people keep finding squirrels like this. I try and feed nuts to a squirrel and wake up in the hospital with rabies.
I had a pet squirrel once. They're problematic. Percy chewed up my bedroom furniture, left chewed up Fruit Roll-Up everywhere, and would climb up on my shoulder and pee down my back.
So cute yet so unhygienic
Yeah, i'm gonna go ahead and be THAT guy for once: Squirrels are rodents. Interacting with a wild squirrel like that might not turn out to be 100% safe
How did he spontaneously tame himself????
Magnificent.. now train him to trade gold coins.
I can't remember the last time I was this insanely jealous. He's so cute!
If Kramer from Seinfeld was a squirrel  this would be him.
In college we used to,do the same thing with a squirrel that would come in our third story apartment’s back porch.

We thought it was cute until we all got fleas.
Just wanna ask this, cuz i'm confused... Don't these wild one have diseases or somethin? Asking for a friend
So, two questions:

One: How did this begin?

Two: Do you have a question mark above your head as you are clearly the final quest NPC?
Pika pika!
Why is everyone else a Disney princess but me :(
Are you snow-white?
Where is this fantasy world? I love squirrels
Scripted
Cute.... But I cant help but think you probably shouldn't be touching wild rodents.
apparently squirrels know the idea of capitalism
How do I sign up for this adorable delivery service?!
*stonks*
Mate you're getting a shit deal.




/s
As a friend of somebody as a kid who got bit by a squirrel, I was REAL nervous.
I’m having one of the worst days of my life and you made me smile. Thank you.
English squirrels are never this friendly... big sad
That’s is awwwwdorable :)
I’d be tempted to pour a giant pile of nuts by the window and make a smol trading kiosk. Maybe dress up a cat or dog as a security officer.

Omg.. so cute .. his ears got me.
Who's gonna clean up the mess though?
messy, very messy. cute , very cute.
What a good little crackhead
So you're a Disney princess now
Shame he doesn't bring you ca$h
I hope you remember to feed him since he might be used to it now.
Times were tough for the PHB after he was finally let go. Dilbert felt badly for him, and would feed him when he came around.
Bartering. Soon it'll be full blown Capitalism
this by far has been the best trade deal of our history
That is your baby now. No looking back.
"Ah yes the negotiator!"
"You got the stuff?"
Squirrels are elf rats.
I guess you found a roommate for the winter!
What is his move set like?
Watch your fingers those little teeth are sharp
Gonna have the teach him to take his mess outside next
You know, technically this makes you a Disney Princess.
He Kinda looks like Bernie as a squirrel.
Ah yes, the negotiator
I wish squirrels near me had those cool Bernie Sanders haircut ears. All I have is stupid gray smooth squirrels.
Leave him alone while he eats please
They might look cute but can be vicious little bleeders, we had one caught in my parents bedroom, it scaled the pebble dash outside and got in through the window. Me and my dad trying to catch it was a right work out. Took forever to catch it, my dad took half its tail fur off (by accident) so it was easy to spot on the estate after
What kind of squirrel is this?? I love his ears!
That’s a pokemon bro
I used to feed a squirrel, becasue I saw shit like this.  Then he cut me one time, because their hands are basically razor blades.  At that point I cut him off, and he started getting mad and almost attacking me, and he'd pee wherever I'd sit(like tables, chairs).

Eventually they drilled into my house and made a nest.
Had the same situation.   Started with nuts.  We moved on to pasta and wine.   Sex became the best.   She left me for a racoon.   I'm lost.
so cute
Fair trade
u/rephil14
How did that squirrel get on the 4th floor window without trees
Had a momma squirrel friendly up to our cat, which was hilarious to us because our cat was a total non-violent antisocial recluse (scaredy cat). Took about 6 months before our cat was greeting it at the back door. Of course once the babies came down mass confusion set in for our cat, so we just kinda kept her indoors while the babies were around. But we knew which one was momma, and she'd show up at the door every now and then and we'd let the cat out for them to hang out (never really played, more just mutual sniffing and our cat getting groomed).
European squirrel ears > North American squirrel ears
Everyone liked that.
God damn that squirrel is cute.
What's it like being a Disney princess?
Goddamn the EARS on him!
Get that man a plate!
Where do you live where squirrels have ears like that? I don’t think I’ve seen a squirrel in Toronto with ears like that before..

However, I haven’t met all of our squirrels so I don’t know lol
Ah yes, the negotiator
Why is no one talking about the fact that OP is running a trap house for squirrels?
Squirrel is a weird word
Is this a Russian squirrel?
"Would you like an ashtray?"

"Mmm, I don't smoke, it's a disgusting habit!'
That has to be the most adorable little squirrel I have ever seen...you are is most favourite human in the world!
Haven't been on reddit for awhile, and this is exactly why. I just get jealous of all these posts 😒 I wanna be friends with a squirrel too...
Isn’t dried seed also just a nut?
Yeah ok disney princess
What a weird pokemon.
This is the law of equivalent trade.
Good thing he isn’t a cat. Rubbing his belly would’ve ended in tears.
don’t they get like super crazy and aggressive if you stop feeding them?

source: stopped feeding a chipmunk. once.
You’re playing a dangerous game here
She fucked with the squiirels quick lets get the fuck out of this dimension!
What sort of badger is that?
This is the cutest shit I've ever seen 😮
Are you sure you're not a Disney princess?
I need you to record more of this and give him more nuts
Thats pretty awsome
Which Pokemon is this?
I wouldn't trust him, he looks kinda squirrelly.
Another victim of market forces
Little dude/dudette has some powerful Kramer energy
The squirrel empire is on a rise. They’ve already learned trade. What’s next? Squirrel villages, colonies, armies? If we don’t act soon they will overthrow us as the dominant species. We must crush this bastardization of the natural order before it spreads. Join me in my fight against the squirrel enemy my country men!
What sort of squirrel is that? We have the brown ones I just thought they got bigger.
Lol it looks back through the window like: "wait that alarm, is that my car? Ok no."
He looks like a mix between a squirt and a kuala to me, for some reason.
He is soooo cute those furry ears
WTH?! Is that a "wild" animal?! How does this happen to where a wild animal will do this? Or is it a pet?
The situation in Argentina has proved far less convenient than predicted
Dude. I just can’t be mad at this. Holy cuteness overload!!
Please don't make him reliable on this!
He’s what I imagine a crazy scientist squirrel looks like
I’d die. This is the most amazing thing ever. He’s so cute omg
An old farmer's trick is to make a good stash spot for squirrels - a covered, hollowed out stump filled with saw dust that they'll stash nuts in there during the fall.  Then as winter nearly hits, check it & replace the nuts with dried corn cobs.  
Native Americans would do something similar as well.
Schools should show people in economics classes this video
He kinda reminds me of Bernie Sanders
Omfg that is so fucking cute!!!!
Well that’s just fucking adorable
I bet that’s a pet, not a wild animal.
Michael: Darryl what are you doing?!!

Darryl: Givin’ him a peanut

Michael: Darryl don’t do that he’s clearly insane!
You can get rabies

Careful
How tf this deal even arranged
Honest pay for honest work
I love that this critter understands the barter concept. This is so great.
How did you convince him he had to bring something for something?
He's a pokemon.
is this a koala bear?
Those foofy ears though 😂😂😂
His hair style reminds me of Einstein for some reason
Peeling the whole nut before eating it, which it seems was the plan, shows a level of self control that most *humans* don't have.
Alright, now get him to bring you money
ah, yes, the negotiator.
This is the cutest thing I have seen in quite a while.
If Don King were a squirrel...
Don't say it....Don't say it.....DEEEZ NUTS GOT EEEM
ARE YOU SNOW WHITE!?!?!?
The best thing is it doesn't beg, it earned the nut by "trading" it
Anyone know whether this sort of "trading" is common in the animal kingdom? I'm imagining a capitalist citadel of Squirrels
He peers out the window so anxiously i can only assume he stole the dry seed from another squirrel.. how gangster
How did you teach him to do that??
A Disney Princess lives there?
Looks like burnie Sanders
Oh my God, cutest thing I have seen all year
That is fucking adorable and I want to pet him
Capitalist squirrel understands the need for trade.
That first turn towards the camera, he looks very crackhead-esque
He’s not happy. He’s INSANE
I was really hoping they would pet him. Was not disappointed
Almost made me shed an aww tear, haha 😇 animals are so precious.
Well don't just stare at it, eat it.
How did this start?!
You are lucky! 
I'll take two please.
What kind of squirrel is this?
Please wash those windows.

Rude, so many crumbs left on desk.
He looks like a mad scientist
Is he auditioning for Pixar here or what? Just lookitim!!
Ah yes, the negotiator
Now you have to start a garden with thise seeds.
The art of the deal.
He allows you to touch him!

Squirrels in my country are like ninjas. Climbs a 6 story building jumps of 2 streets when they see a human approach from half a kilometer distance
I want a squirrel friend as well. Sadly we don't have many here
Holy shit that's so cute. I am saving this on my phone to watch anytime I get sad or upset. He is so adorable.
No. Fucking. Way.. Life isn't fair 😭
I need a squirrel friend
This is how the squirrel flu starts
Squirrel version of Kramer from Seinfeld.
Where the fuck is the sound? I hate seeing soundless videos like this one. :(
That little fucker is going to bite you to the bone one day petting it like that while its eating
Cute but no thanks on the diseases that little guy could bring.
Adorable, but don't touch it bare-handed. Probably a disease-carrier like every other rodent
r/eyeblech
Hmm, no trees nearby, 3rd or 4th floor... how did the little guy get up there? Seems like this is a pet squirrel, and that he was placed outside to stage this “transaction.” Cute little dude though!
He looks like a Cute Evil Squirrel.
Wish i have one ☝️
Symbiotic relationships for the win!
aww that's so far the cutest thing I've ever seen on this sub

Is there a record of this having happened more than one time? "Always"?
Those EARS though . . .
I'm so jealous! This is so sweet
Where do you live
WHY IS HE SO CUTE?! 

The squirrels where I live aren't that cute. They are kinda scary looking... not fair!
Soooo... I wanna see more of this.... thanks
He's a player! Getting the seeds from someone else and trading up to the nuts!!! Smart little dude haha
A business man
Thats just fucking awsome look at it the little guy completely trust the filmer. Animal and human in balance helping eachother out.
Koala plus that one kind of penguin from happy feet. Damn the squirrels here are hella different...
That is the cutest little guy in the trade market. What do you do with the seeds? Also what did he see that he had to take a moment to look out the window?
Turbo-noms
I like squirrels
Train him on coins... Could probably turn a profit over time..
You gotta teach him to bring money next
Give him more
Cutest thing I have seen on the internet!
Awwwwww
*The squirrel of wall street: coming November 3rd 2021*
Blows my mind that some animals can understand trading one thing for another.  Wot a clever little nutkins!
Cute lil guy!
You must have Snow White power of some kind cos it don't feel timid or afraid around you. 😄
You got your own little Pokemon!

I'm that one comment trying to figure out what kind if squirrel this is.

A symbiotic relationship.

Squirrel get food, survive longer.

Human get seed and plant it, making more food for squirrel.
When I was about 5 or 6 and lived in a certain area in Brooklyn, not too far from Prospect Park, I actually used to tap some walnuts together and the sound would just attract them.

Not sure how I got it started, but I remember having to end it because a couple of them broke in and ransacked the apartment.

Damn Brooklyn Squirrels.
Amazing 🤩😍
I wonder how many squirrels decided to jump off before this one came around and decided to come in..
Yo thats nuts
That’s a Raichu if I’ve ever seen one...

Cool
His ears are fabulous
This is cute
The Squirrel Master!
Wtf this is bad ass
Given the market value of dried seeds right now you should be trading at at least a 2:1 ratio in your favour, it's no wonder this little con artist keeps coming back to do buisness with you.
You've begun teaching it economics. Now show it a market crash.
At the end when it seemed like you went to pick him up it seemed like he said, “Woah woah I still have boundaries!” 😂
Man, impressive how quickly he just years through that hard shell
What is a next step?
Those few seconds he stood to stare... all I could think was.... “Precious?! Give us Precious “
Looks like a koala and a squirrel made sweet sweet love. Those ears are a dead give away
That’s just the most adorable thing! You’re so lucky having a little pal like that! Take care of him.
It would be so cool to have a squirrel friend
Just be careful not to get bit by him. Rabies is a bitch.
Does this little guy come in from air vent holes or drill up own route inside on ur vacations🤔🤔

Nutconomics
Koala squirrel
"I pay my way!" -Squirrel
I can kick as well as give you nuts
So does this little guy actually know the “bring gift, get reward” mentality? 

Like, is he actually bringing that as a gift so he can get the nut as a reward? Or is he simply just dragging something in from outside and just showing up because he knows it’s easy food?

I truly believe it’s the former but then again it’s just a little bunny...are they intelligent enough to make that connection?
Fair deal
One day it comes knocking on your window with a finger in its mouth
Omg, where can I get one?? I want woodland creatures to come trade me things for food!
😂🤣🤣🤣🤣 so cute
Does anyone know what kind of squirrel this is? It looks like a red squirrel— but it’s grey??
Bro that's a Pokemon
Oh my goodness, what an adorable little friendship.
Fluffy ears! 🗿
That squirrel could have ate that thing outside.
Yes
I can already tell that you did this for quite some time if he has zero problem with you touching him... even on the stomache.
All fun and games until you get rabies.
Who's that pokemon?
This looks like an Abert's squirrel. We saw some on a drive up to the Gila Cliff Dwellings. I'm curious how he ended up in an urban area, though, since it sounded like they mostly stick near the Continental Divide.
This squirrel looks like Batman compared to the Grey squirrel’s Bruce Wayne.
You're a god damn Disney princess!
Nothing like feeding the wildlife...
Wtf that’s a pokemon
Woww great 😍
It's great to see the barter system in action.

I like how he monches through that almond shell like a twitchy little woodchipper, flinging shrapnel all over the place.

Ah, the European Heihachi squirrel.
He better clear his fucking trash bruh
Squirrels rocking the wolverine hairdo.
Now that is how you compromise.
He is so cut.e :D
I wish I had a squirrel friend
I have someone like this coming  at my home daily
Should teach it to bring you cash
Take away the s in nuts and that’s exactly what my sister does
Look at his furry ears!!!!!!!
