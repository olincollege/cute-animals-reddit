Same thing happens anytime I open a can of tuna for myself to eat. My cat would come racing downstairs when she heard me using the manual can opener. I even went as far as turning the bathroom fan on and opening it in there, but she STILL heard it. Unreal.
that look of "yes peasant...open my food..." Makes this all the better
My cat does the same thing, but he runs on my leg and chirp meows. He looks kind of like your cat but has a white nose. Jes Siberian. His name is Hobbes.
If Batman were a cat, this would be his bat signal.

My cat knows if you even think the word "tuna" and appears instantly with that exact same look on her face.

My little cat used to do this. She passed away last month at 20 years old. I miss her very much üòî‚ù§Ô∏è
That's all we are. Servant can openers for cats.
We used to give our cat Pixel smoked turkey slices as a treat.  It was his absolute favorite.  Eventually he figured out where we got it from in the fridge and would come running every time the drawer with the deli meat was opened.  

What was funny was that it was right next to an identical drawer filled with vegetables.  You could open and close that all day and he wouldn't react at all.  But open the deli meat drawer a fraction of an inch he would appear out of nowhere asking for a treat.

Still don't know how he could tell the difference as they sounded identical to me!
True facts: cats can teleport
What? I've been here the whole time.
Whomst has summoned the almighty one?
In my house, you can‚Äôt open a plastic bag in the kitchen without my dog running in expecting a treat. To her, plastic bags only exist for treats.

Be careful eating or feeding your pets tuna.

Tuna are big fish and a lot of mercury and other heavy metals accumulate in their bodies. It is recommended you don't eat tuna more than once a week.

Early symptoms of mercury poisoning:  
- nervousness or anxiety  
- irritability or mood changes  
- numbness  
- memory problems  
- depression  
- physical tremors  
It might also make you aggressive or irritable. I don't know what it does to cats, but it's probably not good for them.
Our cat has much less patience. If my wife opens a can of tuna he comes for her legs with his teeth and claws.
My cat whaps, slaps, & swipes me with her paw to "ask" to be fed with increasing urgency. The claws will come out after the 3rd swipe. üòÇ
My cat knows the sound of my cabinets and so I‚Äôll be cooking or cleaning or whatever in there all day and he doesn‚Äôt bother me, but as soon as I open the cabinet that contains his cat food he immediately comes running from wherever he was in the house. It‚Äôs like he recognizes the particular squeak the hinges of that cabinet make in particular.
Schrodinger's cat just decided it was living with that sweet click of a tuna can üôè
This is basically any cat.

I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre supposed to make a protective circle of salt before you summon demons from the underworld.
Same thing happens when I open a can, but the only difference is I have 4 cats that pop out of now where.
I get annoyed at this sometimes. Like usually when i cook something my cans require an opener. If I'm making chili one of the things I add has the pull tab. My cats now jump onto the counter and try to get into my chili while meowing loudly thinking it's their dinner.
Mine likes to scream at me and tell me she is there and will not stop until she gets her share.
I love that he just appears out of thin air with that serious all-knowing look

My dog can hear the snap when first peeling a banana and comes running. He can be asleep two rooms away and still somehow hears it
This horror movie looks cool! What's it called?
Same happens  with our cats. Trippy
My sweet baby jelly bean toes needs medication every twelve hours mixed in with his wet food, so whenever he hears me cleaning his syringes or getting a spoon out or opening a can, he comes SPRINTING towards the sound. And I feel so badly if the noise has nothing to do with feeding him :(
I‚Äôm 90% sure there‚Äôs a jump cut riiiigh around the time he puts his left hand down.
No way someone just off camera dropped the cat when it panned away from the door. Nope. No way.
Oh my
This is also my cat. I can run the water and open the can as quietly as I physically can and my cat will still come running
HEED THE CALL OF TUNA!
Haha omfg that made me laugh ty

My cat comes running when I open any kind of can thinking it's tuna. If I open a can of beans she will meow at me until I let her smell it. Only when she sees its something she is not interested in will she leave me alone.
Looks like a Maine coon
Cats are wonders of physics. They‚Äôre solid, then instantly liquid, as required. They change the gravitational fields around them and they teleport. You could pop a top or rattle a treat bag on Mars and a cat would appear to accept her due.

I know how cats do that, as soon as my cat Julios hears me open this container containing his cat food hes sprinting full speed at me
The opening of the tuna or cat food can is sometimes the only way I can find my cat in the house.  The look you get when you open something like (spaghetti O's) that is not tuna/cat food is like the one on your cats face.
My cat is like this. She would be deep in the sleep on the couch, as soon as i open a can she apears behind me.
Awe. Neko Atsume irl.
"The audacity to make me wait"
Cats can hear better than dogs. I'm fairly sure the initial setting it down on the counter triggered the move.

Mine is so addicted to canned tuna, he goes berserk whenever he hears the sound of can being opened.

It's gotten to the point where we have to hide in another room and shut doors if we have to open a can of tomatoes.

My cats know the sound of the glass bowls I use to feed them and the can of food itself so I have cats at my feet and on my legs the second the can/bowls touch the counter.
My cats do this with all cans now. when I make myself tuna salad I drain the tuna water into their dry food. Is it safe?

If the cat is used to food following can noises, then this makes sense.

My cat smells tuna once the can is cracked, in less than 10 seconds; I usually don't even get it open before I get r/catswhoyell material hauling ass down the hallway like it was 5 cats galloping.

We don't feed wet food from cans, so he doesn't know can noises.

I had a cat who was nowhere in sight ‚Äòtil she heard a knife slice into a cantaloupe. Within seconds she‚Äôd be on the counter. 

She had to really want that cantaloupe too cuz with MY Mother she was taking her life in her hands getting on that kitchen counter

My spoiled brat stopped showing up when I open his can, he just stares at me from a spot on my bed - knowing full well he will eat when he, and only he decides it is time.
We found a stray several years ago and she was in very bad shape. She wouldn‚Äôt respond to any sounds, so we thought she might be deaf. 

We noticed she had trouble eating the dry food, so I bought her some wet food. She ran from across the apartment when I opened the can. We still have her and she‚Äôs still that sneaky and stubborn.
It's a cat genie
Very nice
lol. Teleport cat teleports to where da fish iz. ‚ÄúScotty? Beam me bream!‚Äù

Reminds me of our two kitties who would telepawst to the kitchen in a feline femto second at the sound of the dried Go Cat noms rattling in the box as I removed it from the cupboard. 

Mum polished the kitchen floor so younger kitty would slide across the floor when she fruitlessly hit the brakes. Hilarious!

They know where is food coming from.
Just like the adds
We used to feed my first cat tuna occasionally but we never ate it ourselves so cat thought tuna was cat food basically.

Few years later we thought we prob should eat tuna ourselves its good for us. 

Cat would literally howl at us with the most angry meow whilst eating the tuna. Like wtf you eating my dinner??!!
This is my morning routine with my cat.
Happens whenever I open a package of American cheese. All three cats and the dog show up immediately even if there on the other side of the house.
Very familiar
Reminds me of Tony Wonder hiding, waiting for someone to say "Wonder".
My dog is the same with tuna, she does not eat it, she just loves the smell.
More like summoned...
I guffawed.
My sister's cat chased my son around her house because he had a crinkley bag that sounded like his treat bag. I couldn't stop laughimg as he ran aroind the coffee table, tubby silver tabby right behind him.

My cat used to do the same. 

She could be asleep in the other room but would get in the kitchen in less than 1sec when I opened a yogurt.
*teleports behind you* do I smell TUNA?!
You summoned him from his lamp
This is my cat whenever I open a bag of ham. If for some reason I can‚Äôt find him, I open a bag of ham and he comes running. It may actually be his trick for getting me to give him ham... now that I think about it.

My cats. Lol. I also trained them with a personal whistle that they respond to now even if there is no food. It‚Äôs my personal ringtone.
My bf always laughed because he thought of making tune and his cat would show up.  I am realizing that now.  I think of anything my cat may like and she just shows up.
üòç
My cat liked to adventure outside and would sometimes mess with us by running away when we opened the door to let him back inside. When we wanted him to come inside right away we'd open and slam the cabinet where his food was stored and he'd come running. If that didn't work we'd either go outside shaking a treat bag or open a can of wet food.

This is my dogs with anything that might mean someone is opening the freezer. It's gotten to the point that if they see me coming down the stairs with my cup, they both go running to the kitchen to wait for me to give them some ice cubes. They even recognize the sound of the metal straws I use hitting glass and have connected that to getting ice.
