I'm looking forward to the weird videos and content that's going to come out of people going stir crazy stuck at home. Internet's gonna get weird...
That's the most I don't give a fuck cat I've seen in a while.

If someone had predicted this clip as our reality for 2020 a few decades ago we never would have believed them. Quarantined and riding the ~~monowheel~~ onewheel around the kitchen pulling your cat in a radio flyer...
My kids, yeah no school! Then the teachers delivered out homework packets now they are bummed.
The biggest laugh I‚Äôve had in a week! Thank you!
That cat will expect chauffeur service from now on!
It's about to be a long couple of months I feel.
I‚Äôm on day 12 right now and trust me, it‚Äôs just like... man, I don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt even describe it. It‚Äôs like.... well, like every other day this year so far actually... and last now that I think about it.

Fuck, I need to get out more.
I only have one upvote to give, but I'd like it to be distributed as follows:

1/3 to the cat for going along for the ride.

1/3 to OP for enforcing a helmet rule when riding on wheels.

1/3 to kiddo for following helmet rule.


This social distancing is doing our heads in as it is, no need to smack them down on a hardwood floor!
This is the cutest fucking thing I‚Äôve seen in a while. You have made my day, kind stranger!!

After all this time, the conversations I have with my dog are transitioning from ‚Äúsocially weird‚Äù to enlightening. That could be due to the pot brownies I cooked yesterday though. So much uncertainty with this pandemic.
wtf is that skateboard
That cat trained her small human so well in just five days--cant wait to see day 10!

YO!! Yes you, on the hoverboard! Just play video games!! Yes! That‚Äôs all you need to do!!
This kid be living in the future
‚ÄúAs long as I get my fancy feast I don‚Äôt care‚Äù
When the fuck did we get those contraptions. That shit doesn‚Äôt exist in Gotham??
When I was a kid I had a cat that would happily let me stuff it into a pram and push it around the house, sometimes it would even fall asleep in there. It drew the line at letting me put it in dolls clothes though.
I just wanna say that's nearer to an actual hoverboard than anything that got called a hoverboard back when everyone was calling those other things hoverboards.

Meanwhile in Humboldt we‚Äôre still going to work. I had a guy 20 feet from my desk coughing all day yesterday. There are no tests here
Bookmark, so i can show this hilarious shit to my kids later.
Now I want to see the version with the kid in the wagon and the cat riding the wheel
The cat: "Come on, little hooman, show me my kingdom as I rejoice"

I mean it's safe to ride your skateboard outside so long as you're avoiding everyone else.
goddamn I want a OneWheel so bad but I've seen more people eat shit while on it than any other e-board.  
  
and I *still fucking want one.*
I honestly wish my mew would let me mess with her like this. It would make the next few weeks bearable. Instead I get cromch

1000 dollars pulling a wagon that costs 40 with cargo that‚Äôs priceless
How creative of the young man!  Great post!  Thanks for sharing. Keeps us all together while we are in isolation. Some irony in that.
Wish I could give this an award, it‚Äôs so cute it made my night! What a great and smart kid and cool cat. :)
They really vibin tho
The future is now.
Only 5 days for the cat to enslave the child
I wanna see a train of cats, all pulled in little wagons one after another.
Bring on the large cardboard boxes!!!!
thats a cool board

My GF and i are both introverts, my GF might have corona, and we're temporary in a isolation on day 4 until "symptoms" shows themself more to confirm whether she has it or not, and it doesn't affect our daily lives at all as we are both antisocial introverts who prefers to be in our own bubbles every day and rather not go outside unless we have to :P
 The cat does not seem to mind!

And when I was a kid I tried rollerblading in the house once and got an earful about scratching the wood floors.

Haha that cat looks so unimpressed LOL
jaja que bonito
Legit
I knew that was gonna be a Santa Cruz hoodie when he came around the corner on that one-wheel thing.
Kitty digs it.
Well, that's given me some ideas on how to entertain the kids...
Ya Santa Cruz, yewwww
This poor kid and equally sad kitty! We just completed 7 days, but reset due to my job and popping a fever (sorry my three kitties, who I'm suspicious that may have caused my continuation of quarantine). Sorry dude! But that's pretty cool and awesome!!!
Santa Cruz?
That tail!

Btw, what is that powered skateboard thing with one big wheel? Looks awesome, never seen one before.
Sweet Santa Cruz sweatshirt.
That cat is ready for the kids to go back to school.
The fact that he's wearing a helmet indoors makes it even cuter!
Is that a kangaroo outside the back door?
Very Calvin and Hobbes vibe
"i dont have to move. but i move."  - cat probably
day 5 is isolation: I don't think the cat is going to take much more of the kid's shenanigans. he's clearly plotting against us as I have found several knives buried in the litter box when I was cleaning it out. I've also found a note written by the cat. I've only deciphered about 30% of it but it reads something about taking out the larger humans and enslaving the smaller one.
This needs to be the new ‚Äúthing‚Äù

Love the OneWheel Pint. (Not Shill)
I like the cat and the safety of the helmet, if only the cat would have a helmet then this post would be perfect
Nice house. I wouldn't mind being isolated there.
Going well I see
I like the future

Did you steal my cat? Linus would tolerate that. The only cat I know that would. Is that Linus?
Now we just need markipler to include this in his *meow* video

That‚Äôs good he wears the helmet for his safety :D
I love everything about this
Notice how relaxed the cat is. He/she is loving every bit of this train ride.
I like that he has a helmet on, no way would have thought to worn one as a child.
Awesome!
This is why I‚Äôm afraid to get hardwood floors...

Man, you don't know how long I've wanted a one-wheel. Years and years
I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre rolling with the punches.
Ahh so coot

Another five days he'll be teaching the cat to pull HIM

Why is everyone making fun of the isolation? Frankly speaking I found it useful to my personality, I mean, more time for books, podcasts, etc
Where can one obtain that thing he‚Äôs on
*cries in 26 days in isolation*
I see commander keen is doing well.
I'm glad you're making your kid wear a helmet, but that strap needs to be way tighter. Probably not a big deal going 2 mph at home, but if they're riding that onewheel outside, that helmet is useless unless it stays on their head.
And Kitty loves it üòÇüòç‚ù§Ô∏è

How come I can't get my hardwood floor to look that flat? My boards are getting all rough and the resin is chipping out of the knot holes.
That seems fun.
I see you are a man of culture as well
And cats have staff...
We are acting like we did 2 months ago at work here.. It's like Corona never happened. Kinda scary having to weigh the pros and cons of risking my Co workers lives but I can't think of a way to float rent and bills for 2 weeks let alone a month. We're fucked... Already in a loan repayment so csnt go that route.. And to compound it all I lost the love of my life, my dad, and my best friend last year and I still can't feel much of anything after that but sadness and some anger. Just.. I really feel for everyone right now. Everyone is having to make tough decisions and going home to and empty house every night lately has worn me out too. I miss everyone and can't bring myself to get out of the mess, and now all this shit. At the end of the day the biggest thing on my mind has been my ex girlfriend...she got sick a lot and it always hit her hard. I've been super worried she's going to get really hurt by this Corona virus and that drives me crazy. Every part of me wants to reach out but I know she don't wanna hear from me anymore so I sit back and just have to stomach it all. Anyways sorry for the rant.. I pretty obviously am on edge and don't have anyone to talk to these days so I vent on random posts now lol.

He did pretty well,(not bad)will do better to take it slow,master your craft.
How is this cat a dog?  Love it
Cat, "hah, look at this peasant... he's going to feed me after too cause he's getting punked like a betch".
If I had to encapsulate it, this is the internet.
Holy shit things have changed from when I was a kid in the 90s and early 2000s. I thought Super Nintendo was space like

Nice looking hardwood floors! Spring cleaning is unofficially a federal mandate, huh?
Our pets are going to be so exhausted after quarantine
 Cat is like ‚Äúugh, fine I‚Äôll go. But you‚Äôre driving.‚Äù
So cute. Also, nutmeg finish? We had our 20 year old floors redone, and got rid of equally old carpet to get that stain.

Mr on his way to steal your girl.
I need an honest opinion.   I finally am way ahead on my bills and have a lot of cash (outside of my savings and investments).  I want a one wheel.  This is totally my jam.  I longboard to work most days (well now work from home).  I have had my eyes on an electric long board for a while now but this seems way cooler.  So anyway I am already sold. 

But what I need to know is if the smaller ones holds up.  I like the idea of something more compact since I will be riding it to work.  But I am 6'1'' and 180.  Will this thing last.  Is there a noticeable difference between the smaller one and the larger one.   I need to know if i am missing out just a little bit by going with the smaller one or a lot a bit.  

Should i get both?  I mean i would rather throw the left over at something for my wife.
Need these "awww" to get my day going
Cat: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll allow it.‚Äù
I have those same chairs
That is the next thing on my bucket list
Oh that is epic!!
Send that child outside. It will survive
That‚Äôs me on a regular day with no isolation...I love kitties
LOL. Made my night.
Born into easiest life possible.
Yes!  She makes these half meow/cackling noises and I try to make them with her but I sound ridiculous. I don‚Äôt even care though because she‚Äôs purring so loud it drowns it out. She‚Äôs laying with me now.  She‚Äôs going to be so bummed when I have to go back to work.  üêæ
I just buried my cat that looks just like that, this makes me want to cry
Innovation, execution, insightfully delightful
It's either this or watch marble races
I am thrilled to see he has a helmet on! Seen things like this go way wrong to many times before..

As it looks like we're heading into a national quarantine, those same people who wrote that stuff are going to be saying we need to pick up arms against the government on like day 9

Spoiled ass kid
Spoiled kid
To those down voting on comments on how 'rich' they are, you don't understand what its like to have almost nothing. A hoverboard like that is something they can probably never buy because they go paycheck to paycheck. They're kids are at home coloring, watching tv, playing board games. While it's fine to post something that's meant to just be funny and it happens to be someone who better off than most, you don't need to down vote the comment though. It's hard enough already, we're all stressed and people who are lower class can't stock up on essentials and food like all of you, they either don't have insurance or their insurance premiums are a joke. And if they can't work, they don't have money saved in their account. The government is trying to help but we still need to pay that money for rent even if landlords can't evict. They got more problems on their mind, worrying about all that and the rich are worried about the kids being silly. You're already more lucky than most so chill.
They bought their kid a $1500 dollar skateboard .... I've driven cars that cost less than that.
Social distancing means stay 6 feel apart. I doesn't mean you need "day 5 of isolation " or any isolation.  Let the kid go outside.
Please tell me you're not such a goofball you actually quarantined yourself...
