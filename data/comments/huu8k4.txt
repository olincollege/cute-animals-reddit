I hope my girl makes it to 17. So sweet
So much Turkey in one photo...
Look deep into her eyes. Into her soul. Softy tell her how much you love her. What a good girl she’s been. Lots of kisses (can’t give too many).  Let her lick your bowl. Give her a piece of whatever it is you’re eating (but not too much).

Then keep repeating.
𝙰𝚠𝚠, 𝚜𝚘 𝚌𝚞𝚝𝚎!
Give her a hug for me ;) She's a very cute dog.
N'aww Hi sweet girl! Thank you for sharing her with us. :)

My old guy died at 14. My mom and I have done our best to make sure he had a great life. 17 yr old is a miracle. She is lucky to have great owners.
Old Top Puppers!
For what it's worth, when my dog got to about 15, she started sitting in her food bowl too.
Lovely Doggo. Precious bond. ♥️

Sweet little girl. ♥️
What a sweetie
She's a precious baby 4ever.
❤️🐾🐾
🥰
Giver her a very delicate hug from me and my old girl Zoe
Hugs and kisses.  We just lost an 18 year old.
I love my old dogs. Yours’ face reminds me of my black lab/Akita mix who passed a year ago at the age of 17 (2 months short of 18) and she was the best companion I could have ever hoped for. A bit of an aloof curmudgeon in her old age, but still a puppy at heart even when she was transitioning to the big field in the sky. Enjoy your time with yours. Every moment.
My Chelsea girl, golden retriever, lived to be about 19. All white! My sweet girl, miss you baby! Shoutout to my 6 yr old yorkie who just turned 6 and has filled my heart with love again.
I look into those sparling eyes and see heaven looking back at me.  Shes beautiful 
Tell her I'm sending love and hugs to a perfect pup. ❤❤❤🥰
Old dogs are the best buds.
I love her. I want to give her whatever she wants.
Awww she looks like the goodest girl, give her a for me :)
<3 she’s so sweet. We had to say goodbye to our basset hound today, she was going on 15. Seeing your baby warms my heart a bit. She has lots of love in her eyes please give her a treat for me
You are SO lucky to have a dog live for 17 years. Give her some pets for me :)
The wisdom in that majestic beasts face is astounding. Beautiful, if Buddha had a dog equally as wise as him, without a doubt it would look exactly like your dog. You know it, I know it, we all know it. Your ancient doggys  gonna out live us all. Seize the day doggy carpet denim!!

Opps I mean 
Carpe diem
She's beautiful!  Thank you for sharing.
(づ￣ ³￣)づ
She is so beautiful!!! You're so lucky to have had so much time together :)
She’s beautiful.  Give her many pats for me, please!
She doesn't look a day over 300
*inhales deeply* BABY
We don't deserve dogs
❤️❤️My heart just melted!!!! This precious girl just stole my heart! ❤️❤️
She is lovely and I love her.
What a sweet girl!
I can tell when a dog is loved and that is a loved dog.
This gives my hope for my 14 year old girl. Thank you
Okay I will pet my dog if you pet your dog. 

<3
Best baby girl ❤️
She a beaut ain’t she
17??? Good life and family she has!
We have a girl that's 17, but she's much smaller.  Almost totally deaf, blind in one eye.  We just feed her when she's hungry now, so overall she's having a great time.  Hoping for just a few more years.
oh my 🥺
My God she's beautiful 😓
Hi, I love you.
She is beautiful 🤍
I had to put down my 12 year old boy today. Seeing yours so old gives me so much happiness and love :) I hope you many years left with your pupper as I did with mine. Lots of pets and kisses.
She’s my favorite, and I love her and keep coming back to see this pic of her while I’m on my break. Such a lovely lady.
No one asked to see her but we wanted to she her (ignore my dead joke)
She’s beautiful!!! Please hug her for me! I lost my dog Erika because I was teenage and stupid, I’d give anything to hug her once again
I am so glad I got to see her.  Giving your good girl lots of love.
Hi there momma. 🥰 I have yet to meet ya and I already love you so much. You got such a lovely, kissable face. I hope your family continues to shower you in love and gives you all the treats. Take care momma. 

I can’t help but refer to female dogs as momma and male dogs as poppa. They make my heart so happy with their cute, furry bodies and their tail wiggles of excitement, and their boopable noses, and their rough little toe pads, and the pitter-patter sound of their nails. I love the doogies. I hug mine and hope he knows I love him and he makes my life complete. Just like my kitty too.
You’re a good person
Yes, Queen.
So sweet. Our boy just turned 16. I love him!
A sweet old babe!
We had an 18 yo Bischon she was amazing , as this senior queen of the hose is.
Please give her a treat on my behalf! What a healthy looking doggo!
♥️
I love seeing old dogs like this I look at my 3 year old heeler and hope I’m lucky enough to have her as long as you’ve had this lady
This dog is very clearly a wise old woman about to give us a quest.
\~This made me tear up immediately...i miss my Old Lady!  Sweet pic!!!

My poor senior dog finally got a grooming appointment today... the groomer said he had to take breaks to sit on the floor...she said she told him he could sit on the table but he wanted to stand. Broke my heart a little knowing how old he is getting... lots of hugs and pets for the senior dogs.
Hi beautiful girl!! ❤️🤗 hugs and pats.
Oh she is beautiful. Senior dogs are just the best. ❤️
I love her!
There's still so much light in her eyes :)
I love her soulful eyes. You can see she’s been around a while and knows things.
My dog is seventeen too! Over the past year she’s really slowed down, and now she’s losing a lot of control of her backside. (She’s a dachshund so it’s common) Shes older than me and even though she’s been around my whole life I can barely remember the dog she used to be anymore. As much as I love her, she is so hard to take care of, which sucks. My mom said we’ll probably be making plans soon. My heart is with you.
I love her!
Thanks, I love her
Aw man, she’s so cuddly! I wish I could hug her and bring my dog over for play time!
That’s 119 to you and me
Cute
So precious ❤❤❤
Gorgeous.  We should all look so good at her age.
What a Sweetheart!  It's love at first sight for me!
Crossed legs cute!!

Hello beautiful!!!
Thanks for sharing.  My little 18 yo princess (kitty) is in her last days/weeks.  Anything special you do to celebrate while we still have them?
Lovely
My boxer 'Bert' died in my arms early Sunday morning of a stroke, just days before his 13th birthday. I thank God I got to hold him, and hopefully bring him some calm. Every day you have with them is precious
May she live much longer still .
She’s beautiful
We see her. What a lub. She’s lucky to have you.
My girl Luna passed in April from cancer only had 10 years with her. Seemed like 2.  
My girl before her I had for 18. I had to let her go. She had gone deaf and her eyes were
Dim. She was losing the strength in her hind legs so she would soul herself at night. Poor dear. I knew I had to let her go then. I cried for 3 days straight. 
I hope you hold her and appreciate all she’s giving. 🙏🏽 she looks so sweet and tired.
What a sweet faced little buddy. I'm glad you decided to post this.

Old dogs are the best dogs...
Hi Babe!
Yay, Marie! Sweet old doggie-dog, seen it all I'm sure, and the best of faithful pals.
Give her a pet and a kind words for me.
It's been almost 30 years since we had a dog, but I'll miss him forever.
Thank you
She's beautiful.
Such a beautiful sweet heart!
I am in love 😍❤️
Well, thank you for sharing her! She’s cute, yo!
r/oldmandog

Bless her heart (in the most loving possible way) 😘
Hugs and kisses to her 😘
Oh my gosh give that baby some love from me!
Awesome dog!
Catching the feelz here thinking about my late sister (16 y old Pomeranian )
❤❤
She's beautiful and I love her!
She's a beauty. Please give her a big smooch from me.
thank u
Aww hi lady!
🥰
thank you!!!
What a sweet old gal. I want to scratch her ears and kiss her forehead. You are both lucky to have each other.
I upvote even though it is a drop in the bucket. We are so lucky to know our wonderful friends. Thank you for sharing this.
...I’m not crying, my eyes are just leaking 😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I’ve never wanted to pet a pup more. I love her.
I just met her and I love her already ❤️❤️
yea uum she might die soon
I love her. Just lost my grey 15 year old girl last year.
❤️❤️
This reminds me of my grandma’s dog. She was there my whole life. Sadly she lost her vision and died from old age shortly after that. She lived a good life and I really miss her. 🤧
Mine is turning 14
Can you give her a treat for me please???
I have a 19 year old lil Yorkie I really need to post. Your pup is so beautiful.
That’s a good doggo!
She’s very lovely. I am glad to have seen her.
I love her
She looks so happy and like she's had a great life so far!
My aunt’s dog was just about year for year with me and died when I was around 21. Honestly crazy to think about.
A blessed beautiful lady. Thank you for sharing
Fuck man I would love a dog but am to scared that I would get too attached and have a mental break down if he/she where to die. Look at that face:( at least she lived a good life with you OP
What a sweetie! Makes me think of Trico! https://www.google.com/search?q=trico&client=firefox-b-1-m&prmd=isnv&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjtvsXsnd3qAhVvkeAKHa6iCsQQ_AUoAXoECBgQAQ&biw=414&bih=716#imgrc=m0sY34O8xsbH7M
What breed is that:)
I love her
I love her 😍
Blessed
She’s beautiful ❤️
GORGEOUS! They somehow get sweeter as they get older. Her grey fur is like spun sugar.
God love her
I’ve been blessed on this day. Thanks for sharing this wonderful doggo.
God bless her.  ❤️
She’s beautiful
She is perfect.
Shrs gorgeous. Just lost my 16 year old buddy and it really hasn't been easy.  Spoil the hell out of her in her last days, she deserves it!
Give lots of love! She looks like a sweet girl.
This is the first post on aww that made me say aww out loud because of the title and picture. What a sweet dog
❤️
She’s perfect :) I wanna boop that snoot
Silver from head to toe (with a little “young” in between)
She’s fuckin beautiful!
I love her
Tell her I love her
I had to put down my “sister” 2 weeks before her 18th. She was with me for 2/3 of my life at that point in my mid 20’s. Still Haven’t gotten another dog 5 years later. Senior dogs are just the best
Awww she’s so cute!  What’s her name?
Seniors, gotta love em!
Tell her she's beautiful and give her a kiss from me! <3 I've got an old girl too. Lots of grey hairs on her pretty face.
Only dogs that live a happy life get to live that long.
she’s a cutie ❤️
Good doggo I got a 14 and 1/2 year old girl doggo
She’s beautiful.
Awwww shes beautiful wish her many more yrs
Treasure every single precious moment you have with her. That’s probably my biggest regret with my pets that have passed away, taking for granted their presence and their love especially at the end of their lives. Hold her tight and make sure she feels so loved ❤️
Many happy memories. When she leaves don't mourn for your loss.... Smile for the memories
I’ll bet she’s a real sweetie. Give her a kiss for me
Hello pretty girl
God bless her sweet face!  Older dogs will always have a special place in my heart.
my beagle have a 12 years and he's not feeling good lately. thank you for the poem, it's make me cry, but in the good way :)
she's so beautiful 😍
I lost my Annie Mae (she was 16) 2 years ago yesterday. I needed this. Thank you.
Omg that face... what a sweet sweet girl!!!
She's a pretty girl!
She is so beautiful, big hugs to her ❤
Gorgeous! My girl’s 15.
Give her a big hug from me!
Awwww hey sweet girl. Seventeen! Wow. Bet she’s had a great life. 🥰
Gorgeous gal!
Get her a Casper bed to lay on, my old doggie loves it,  when he’s not in my bed! What a beautiful soul.
She seems a bit underweight from the photo. Is she just not eating as much or are you keeping her that way for arthritis? 

My dog just turned 15 herself June 30th. She still seems to have a robust appetite but I limit it because otherwise I feel like she more joint paint in the cold months. 

I feel like anything past 14 years is uncharted territory. Anything can go wrong. It’s a worry and a blessing having dogs be past the average. 

This one is my little lady monkey: https://i.imgur.com/QktJaw9.jpg


She’s staring at the wall as usual haha.
Beautiful ❤️
Mine acted like a puppy right up until the end. It was a huge shock when she had her heart attack. It was hard to believe she could die when she acted so young just a few weeks ago.
Hi, Marie!!! Lots of hugs and kisses from our family <3
Give her a kiss and cuddle from everyone on reddit please !!!! Such a cutie 💜
I love her.  Please give her a kiss on the head from me.
17! Wow! Reminds me of my senior puppers who just passed away. Give that girl a hug for me!
Please give her a nice soft bed to lay on, her old bones will thank you.
She is beautiful.  There is no truer gift than a dog's love. Thank you for sharing
That's a good girl if I've ever seen one
Three years ago we said goodbye to our best boy just before what would have been his eighteenth birthday. Hardly a day goes by that I don’t think of him, and I still sometimes think I see him out of the corner of my eye or smell him. RIP, Louie.
Such a good girl.
Soo sweet. I can’t
Such a precious sweetie! Just lost my 17 year old buddy a few months ago.  Poem made me tear up. Our 'fur babies' are such loyal companions.
Nice old lady.
We love her! What's her name?
She’s beautiful
I wish I could post a picture of my dog and get 60K upvotes and dozens of awards
She is perfect. My dog lived to an old age and I miss her everyday. I can tell your dog has lived a full and loving life.
She’s so adorable!
I love her
Such a schlumpy guuurl.

What a special lady! It’s takes a lot of love to stick around for that long ❤️
I love her😍
She’s an angel, what a sweet girl.
Those elbows 🤗
💓
My friends and I always ask what the peak of each others day was. I was worried I wouldn’t have one today until now. Thanks :)
Precious puppers
God bless her.  Hope for many more years of life and that you both get to enjoy each other.  My 10 yr old  pup passed away last week from a thrombosis very unexpected, I'm beyond devastated. I can't articulate how much I love him and miss him.
give her tons of love/scratches and pets for me. she doesn't seem to be feeling good (no i haven't read through the comments yet)...

Why 2 smaller rugs on top of a bigger area rug?
Gotta love the many years they get to grace us with. We definitely don’t deserve such unending love but when it’s given to us, we never forget.
Such a sweet old lady

Gorgeous little lady
Pure love... beautiful
Hi baby!!!!!!!!
I love her with all of me.
I love seeing the old dogs and cats, but it makes me sad too. My group is getting on in years. My three old lady cats are 12-14, and the dogs are 13. My old man Pom doesn’t recognize me in the middle of the night. 

Bittersweet. So many years of love ❤️
She is full of love. Ready to get up and give a console.
Awe, Hi sweet girl!
She is beautiful. My family sends hugs and pats because all lovely old girls deserve them 24/7.
Absolutely beautiful!
Such a cute old girl, what’s her name?
Can she still walk?
Baby...
Hello precious girl ❤️ ❤️ ❤️
Aww her face! We had an old gal who was a black Belgian sheep-dog, and her whole face had turned gray in her later years. I’ll always remember that face coming up to me for snuggles and kisses.
I love her and Marie is the best name ever for this lovely girl.
Oh I love her! You're so lucky to have her with you. There's nothing better than a gray muzzle. Give her a belly rub from me!
My girl is 17, almost 18, and I am so glad I'm seeing yours.  She is beautiful and I am proud of her.
Does she know that she’s absolutely perfect in every way?
Awww what a sweet baby ❤
I see her and love her.
Thank you for sharing a picture of your girl.  She looks very sweet.  Please give her some rubs from me.
I love her
She's clearly a good girl. Possibly the goodest girl, but don't tell my dog, I tell her that she is all the time.
Darned onions come out of nowhere.
Dang. This is a medium sized dog too. What an adorable lil old lady!
Witness the doggo all shiny and chrome
Been a good girl since back in thunderdome
She’s beautiful! Thanks for sharing. You’re both so lucky to have a pup live that long. I’m jelly.

Beautiful girl!
I subscribe to far too many NSFW subs to see the title "This is my 17 year old girl and I just wanted you to see her" and not feel that the FBI is about to burst through my front door when I first stumbled onto this title on my feed lol.
Tell your dog I love her.
Thank you for showing me your sweet girl. She’s perfection.
Hi baby!
Gorgeous!!
Looks like shes a lean mean snuggle machine!
That's one beautiful girl...
Beautiful girl!
Please give her all the pats. Also, explain she is the best girl.
