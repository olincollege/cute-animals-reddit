This seems hilarious until you're done playing and try to put it down for real.
I loved the wall jump. Lil mans is having so much fun.
It‚Äôs all adorable fun and games until it wants to do this for ten hours straight...
Imagine trying to get 10 bloodthirsty sables off of you.

Remember these are not typical pets and you might not be prepared to house one.  And I image there might be legal issues depending on state / country. https://animals.net/sable/

Ok reddit, you know what to do.

Tell me all the reasons this guy would be terrible as a pet.

Acrid smelling urine?

Complete destruction of your furniture?

Non stop jumping at your face?

It's going be something and it's gonna be a lot.
I know they say these don‚Äôt make good pets, but videos like this make me think that‚Äôs a lie.
So this is how you play fetch with a murderfloof.
Is that just a cat? Or what is it??
I used to do this with my housemate's cat, after accidentally discovering that it loved being tossed (I tripped while carrying the cat and managed to toss it on the couch). Cat was just like this, but a little fatter and slower. Other housemate saw me toss the cat and had a completely reasonable "WTF?" reaction, and had an even more confused one when the cat came bounding back into my arms.     
That was a fun cat.
He doesn't look too heavy. Must be a light sable. An elegant animal, for a more civilized time
Nice marmot
Adorable üòç so glad Buddy isn‚Äôt in somebody‚Äôs coatüëèüèΩ
I like that wall jump.
I could watch this all day
this is very, very russian lol
Good luck slipping that sable under the tree
This is like a trust fall in so many levels
The is the cutest thing i have seen this week üòçü§ß

Adorable. I'll take 70.
What's wrong with your cat?
My brother played that game for two hours with a fisher once. It was pretty adorable.
Ok naruto calm the fuck down 


Also I feel like this also belongs on r/zoomies
Cool, cool, but what‚Äôs a sable?

If that were an animal in the wild this would be terrifying.
"YOU WILL LOVE ME!" - Buddy the Sable.
alinity would love this game
But when I try this with the neighbors' kid it's aBuSiVe üôÑ
I want this problem.
Now I wish I really have a pet.
made my day! That's not easy to do.
This is a far better application for them than coats.
You saw it in her face a few times,but I felt every one of those claws grabbing into her arm. Trying to hold on a few times as she was tossing it.
I'd name him Mercury.
Looks like a good cardio workout for both!
Me trying to unadopt kids
That's hilarious, simply hilarious!!!
10 hours later...
TIS A MAGNET
I was wondering if this was a ferret with THAT kinda energy, and no, it was just a cat with a major case of the zoomies.
Plot twist: he‚Äôs actually trying to bite her throat open and feast upon her flesh
I felt like holding a jelly
Kinda wish i am in this game. This is too cute.
All fun and games until you catch a flying sable to the face at 2am
Here I was wondering why they're playing with fire, and why they weren't being sliced apart, then I realized it wasn't a kitten
*LET THAT THING LOVE YOU.*
How do you stop playing or is this just your life now? Hehe
Why r u throwin dat boi
It‚Äôs like a four-legged, fuzzy version of herpes.
My roommates kitten LOVES to be tossed on the bed
My life will not be complete until I have a ferret dog üßê
Holy shit that‚Äôs what I call limber! Also he has so much trust in her to catch him. Look at his body language when jumping over to her. He goes completely limp. He expects her to catch him 100%.
This has to be in the Top 5 best things seen on the interwebs üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª
Who wouldn‚Äôt love a pet giving them this much attention? This lady is on top of the world
At one point in my life I had 4 ferrets and I would just do this (gently) with them and no they never want to stop as much as they just eventually get distracted by each other/their own asses
Animals are so smart, much more then we give them credit for, 
 playing catch with my dog, when the ball rolled under or behind my truck and couldn't find it, all i had to do was tell him "under" or "go around", or "in the back", if the ball landed in the bed of my pick-up. he also knew "in the truck" which meant he could sit in the front seat and stick his head out the window.  Not brain surgery of course, but he also used the words i taught him in other situations,  to test him out i started running around the perimeter of my yard one day, and he kept barking and play nipping at me heels, a new game to him, so i yelled go around!, he stopped trying to nip my shoes, got in line, and started "go around" the yard right next to me. After working him really hard one day, as i went up on my porch, he  made a little noise and looked down at the concrete, i got the message, i went inside, filled up his water bowl, put it on the porch, his tail going 90 MPH, after that, when ever he was thirsty, he'd walk over to me, and look at the ground. He taught me, his version of sign language between two species, i want a drink of water. Not bad for a "dumb animal."
Lol, hilarious!!
Dat wall jump
Crossfit keeps getting weirder
What a fun workout
This is the real cat snake
Parkour!
He‚Äôs just wearing her down and when she‚Äôs tired..BOOM! It‚Äôs dinner time with some left over for Boxing Day üòÇ
Buddy is so beautiful! And I thought **ferrets** were cute and ornery af! I have so many questions....

(Like where are you-all? America? Canada? UK? Australia?  How did ya get a sable? How long do they live? How big is he? & blah blah blah...)

Oh, obligatory: not all pets are good for all people. And vet care for pets outside of the cat/dog/horse variety isn‚Äôt always easy to find, laws differ in different States regarding keeping them as pets... and so on. Sometimes a little common sense can go a long way; like ya can‚Äôt keep an elephant in a high rise apartment.
is that a squirrel or a cat
Jesus
HARDCORE PARKOUR!
So this reminds of something....

Many years ago and when I was about 19, one of my best friends since high school lived in a real shitty party house with two other people. One of those roommates had a ferret that held dominion over that shit filled apartment. One day I came over and the ferret owner was sliding the ferret across the hardwood floor into stacks of empty beer cans to knock them over bowling style. Sounds pretty terrible, but the ferret clearly loved it, and would run right back for more. 

Overall though that dude was a terrible pet owner and a piece of shit psychopath ü§∑
I was about to ask if that's a ferret or a cat. Turns out the actual animal (sable) looks like a cross of both
Buddy even optimised the route they took for maximum leaps

You‚Äôve found their favourite game
Parkour practice
I...Want one
I'm tired, kitty. Give me a rest.

Kitty: No, you are not.
Lmao Jesus this is awesome
That sick jump and kick off the wall lol
Legit just thought it was a long cat. Energetic cute little bastard anyway
I wonder what‚Äôs actually going on in the cats mind. What is it thinking is happening lol
How common (and manageable) is it to have a sable as a pet?
I don‚Äôt know what a sable is but I want one now
When I was a teen I had a friend who had wall to wall carpeting in his basement. Like literally carpet on the walls.

We were hanigneout in his basement doing acid one night and his cat walks by.

He says, look at this. He grabs his cat and throws it on the wall. The cat stuck like Velcro. He jumped down and ran back to him. He grabs him again a throws it on the wall. The cat comes back...

Remember, were on acid. We threw that cat so many times laughing our asses off. And the cat came back every single time. time he was having as much fin as us. Lol
Just in case people are wondering - 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sable
I could watch this all day , is it clawing you in the process ?
It redefines the phrase "playing fetch with your pet."  He fetches himself.
As far as I remember she saved him from animal farm , in Russia sable fur is very popular. He was going to be killed. They have an Instagram @sablebuddy!
Yo, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs playing. I bet she owes him money or something.
my ferret plays like this tooüíï
That is so freakin cute
Get that parkour
He had to burn off that kitty energy. Cats don't go for walks like dogs do. I'm sure you'll and he will grow old of the grand lol
That's a mad kitty
Nice marmot.
Crazy busy little critter
Awesome!
I don't even know what a Sable is but watching that makes me want one. Seems like fun.
What is that?
What the fuck is wrong with your cat?...
Ima come back like a boomerang
Yo what the fuck is that thing
Awesome!!
awww
BOOMERANG!!!! You do always come back!!
Somebody make this a GIF
How do I get one of these guys?
aight so my reddit app has the sub's title near the post title and i read this as "buddy the tablesaww" and was confused to see a weasel thing instead of power tools in the gif.
[deleted]
I thought it was a cat and thinking no way in hell that cat is normal. A cat would probably scratch the heck out of her after her first attempt to throw it.
That is one hyper cat lol
Just take my updoot allready and continue to play with your cat :)
This is adorable!
I want one lol
Does it have a pleasant aroma?

Good things its not a Sabletooth
Crazy to think people made (make?) coats outta these things. 
Now Im wondering what kinda messed up shit they do to catch a bunch of these poor creatures....
Ma‚Äôam you don‚Äôt have a cat you have a flying squirrel. üêø
Mf said "boing!"
What the hell is THAT?
Is it a cat or squirrel? I couldn't catch up, it so quick
Oh god this is so cute! Thanks for smile <3
That‚Äôs adorable... until I‚Äôm trying to like cook or do some laundry lol.
Until they go for the spine. :-O
An excellent way to workout
That cat is sooooo long
Where can I get one of those and how do I care for them?
Used to do this with my pet rats - they loved it
And how does one acquire a sable?
This is amazing I‚Äôve been staring at this for hours.
So it‚Äôs like having a dog in a cat like body. (I know a sable is a kind of ferret but this just seems more catlike to me)
New internet name for sables is aderallcat.

I have literally NEVER heard of a sable in my life. Wtf!
Great! Now I want one!
Where would one get a stable for a pet?  Are they all high energy?  Not for everyone I assume.
It‚Äôs a bummer that these smart little dudes are farmed and slaughtered for their fur alone.
Nice marmot

TIL what a sable is

My former cat use to do this. Would throw him across the room onto the couch and he'd run back to do it again.
My cat loves this too and when SHE is done she licks my hair to calm herself down
The cat sees the eldritch horror in the corner and is only trying to get to safety
This is the best thing I've seen today! Thank you, I've been on Twitter all morning hating myself.
I don't think that is a cat
What is it?
When she drops it üëÄ
Reminds me of pepe le pew the cartoon character.
Ik this seems irrelevant but really shows how allinity throwing her cat over her chair was so overblown they are little ninjas
why is 1/16th of my new coat running around like some animal.
I read the title before watching the video as I was scrolling really fast, and I accidentally read the "S" in "Sable" as a "T".
As one might expect, I was left very confused.
What is it?
I'm getting wrestling flashbacks. I don't remember if it was WCW or WWE, but that was when I first learned about sables.
I was worried about how much that would hurt because of claws and then I realized that thing is basically a ground squirrel.
I had a kitten try playing this with me while I slept. I was not amused.
It's all fun and play until you accidently yeet it into the wall because someone spook you while you where about to launch him again
My cat did this too üòÇ if I could have then for hours
Aww I love Cats
I want one üòÇ
That is one hungry sable! That girl played it cool on the account of being attacked over and over.
unstable sable
I‚Äôm just a guy with a boomerang!
If ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt leave me‚Äù was an animal
This gives me anxiety watching it!
What animal is that?
Here's a [video](https://youtu.be/ESPFBqCmdEE) featuring Buddy and his owner Natalia. The description includes a story about how Buddy came into her life. 

From the Caters Clips YouTube channel:

>A small sable was saved from being used for his fur and, after being rejected by a zoo, has become a family pet. 

>Buddy the sable was rescued from a fur farm in Moscow, Russia, when he was just two months old. 

>Natalia Khorosheva took Buddy to a zoo psychologist so he could be assessed for a reintroduction program, but he was deemed too high risk and couldn't be accepted. 

>From then on, Buddy stayed with Natalia as her pet. In the house, the curtains have become a great source of enjoyment as Buddy enjoys climbing up them before launching himself down from the top.
Wish there was sound! Thats hysterical
KITTEN ENERGY
Its kinda like that one scene from Re-Animator.
This is cute and all, but as a new kitten owner myself, I know that cat is just nonstop trying to attack her faceüòÇ

One of my ferrets and I play a version of this.  She‚Äôs forever trying to slinky herself behind my pillows and get onto my nightstand.  So she‚Äôll rush up and I‚Äôll grab her and toss her little butt back at the end of the bed and we repeat this until she finds something else to get into.
