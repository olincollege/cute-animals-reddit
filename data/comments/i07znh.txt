There's no love like bun luv. We've rescued 3 in last two years and we love every minute of having them. For any questions you may have, consult the houserabbitsociety.com, they are excellent and an invaluable resource for us.

Hi Korra
She has mastered all forms of Bunding
Tell Korra I love her, please
I dont have any money but here's an award 🎖️
Carrots, hay, earth, greens. Long ago the four snacks were chomped on in harmony. But everything changed when the Fox Nation attacked. Only the Bunsvatar, master of all four elements could stop them, but when rabbits needed her most, she vanished. But I believe Korra can save the world...
"I'm the avatar and you gotta deal with it!"
Bum-Ju!!!
Here is my dog Korra https://imgur.com/gallery/aH5NbKN
missed opportunity with the name Flopsy
Can’t wait for her legend
What a boop!
Awww so cute!! Look at the little ears and feet 😍
You have been displaced!
Omfg my fiancé’s heart just dropped seeing this! Her bunny just passed away a couple days ago. His name was Korra 😢
ATLA and TLOK are amazing.Good choice 👍
Adorable
Beautiful and adorable ❤️
She's a bunny, and you have to DEAL WITH IT!!!
Korra (corra) means 'run' in Portuguese.
Rabbitar
[Korra](https://imgur.com/a/a7Z6KNA) says thanks for all the upvotes 🐰
If I get another cat it'll be named Asami, it's such a pretty name.
Tell Korra I would die for her.
I used to have a little bunny as a girl. I always sleeped with him xd. This bunny reminds me of him.
OMG
That name makes me remember the choir singing during Duel of the Fates by John Williams.
We've been cuted! Resistance is futile!
I hope she's read up on keeping bunnies, cause they do things that are to us are wrong.

They eat their own poop - let them.
Dedo
Do you plan to get another bunny named Asami?
Bunny’s get the sads unless they cohabitate w/ another bunny. I would suggest getting a 2nd bunny. <3
SHE’S THE AVATAR! YOU GOTTA DEAL WITH IT!
Get a second one they need socialization to be happy/free range in the house
Fake post, people on reddit don’t have girlfriends
My Holland Lop was the sassiest bun I've ever had. Enjoy your years together :3
Too cute.. My daughter has always wanted one
Can’t wait until she starts to bend. Welcome the new avatar for me.
I had this exact holland lop in 2016. Same ears, size, breed and color. She was beautiful but sadly passed away. It almost feels like seeing her again. Make sure they get a proper diet and open space.
Omg I love this bunny! Korra is the cutest!
now all you need is another bunny and name it Asami :)
Only the Rabbitar can master all four elements and bring balance to the world.
She Korra-dorable!!! ❤🐰
Love the bun. Love the name. Do you have plans to get another bun and name them Iroh?
That bunny is legendary.
Perfect name! She has a lot to live up to with her name.
This is a stick up!!!  Give me the bunny an no one gets hurt!!! ❤️❤️❤️
But has she mastered airbending yet?
I love you Korra
My wife got a Flemish Giant years ago. We named him Bernard Hopkins. We did a ton of research on taking care of bunnies and followed all of the vets advice. He passed away at 9 months. He was litter trained and escaped his cage every night. He was like a magician, cage locked up still in the morning. You would wake up feeling something soft and be all "... my cats not this soft!" Hed look at you and dip. RIP Bernie. May you startle god every morn.
Bunnies are cute. They can be trained easily to use a litter box. They also love to chew cords and wires. Get plenty of chew things for it. It is the only way they keep the teeth down. They continue growing longer like horses and other mammals. That's why they go for cords etc.
She's going to give Cabbage Corp a whole new set of problems
Korra looks so cuddly and soft
I would die for Korra.
I love you Korra
She will master all four elements: Carrots, Nibbling, Digging, and Fluffiness
Good smoll one
I had two of these 2 years ago but they died😔
So she's a legend
And now you're in few a lifetime of rabbits, because you definitely need an Aang now.  And we know how bunnies be...  Maybe convince her to get a Toph, maybe she goes that way.
Just precious!!
So freaking cute
Cute holland lop
BABY
I think you meant your girlfriend’s new girlfriend.
Omfg bun 😍
Instant love!
FLOPSY
She's the Bunny, and you gotta deal with it!

 Cabbages have never been in more danger.
Your girlfriend's new girlfriend
She needs a polar bear-dog sidekick!
Avatar korra, the first bunnybender
The Legend of Korra!
Avatar fan I'm guessing, yes she has the eyes of the water tribe. So adorable, she will restore balance to the world ;)
I was going to put a avatar comment but people beat me to it soooooo. (Insert avatar joke here)
I do not have any Avatar jokes to make, mostly because I’ve never seen the show or any other media from the franchise, but I do have lots and lots of bun snuggles. 🐰❤️🤗
Korra is a sight for sore eyes. Love❤
Which elements has she mastered?
Looks like a duck
/u/oriolous now I want to get a bunch of bunnies and name them all after Avatar characters
She bends cuteness and wiggles
Korea is such a great name, my gf and I were planning on getting a corgi and naming her Korra. My one friend has a bunny and I helped name them. After a dimensional pokemon and the late Chester Bennington. Giratina Bunnington.
August 14 can't get here soon enough
The legends, they're true.
Corra, Korra, corra! (*)

(*) "Corra" means "run" in portuguese.
looks like a ragdoll
She’s the avatar, get used to it!
How many elements has she mastered?
Give Korra to me
im the avatar you gotta deal with it!
She has the constant "hold me" look.
Aw! She looks similar to mine who passed away a few years ago. The best pets. ❤️
Oh my goodness! What a cute little fluff! 🥰
The Legend of Korra
Omgoodness she's such a little doll! I have a blue Otter grey Lop named Ollie, they are the best lil furry babies! 😁
fun and games until it poops on you
Awww is it a mini lop or a normal lop?
Just in time for the Netflix release that's coming in the next couple of weeks 🙌
she will grow to be the king of the lands
Awww omg her face!!!
Looks just like Bum-Ju, Bumi’s spirit rabbit 🥺
A legend about a rabbit i hear
She is a cutie
She's the avatar and you gotta deal with it 😂
she is cute
She's a keeper.
I love bunnies!
She's gonna have a little trouble with airbending, but she'll be fine :)
BUMJU!!!!!!
It's a puppy bunny!
Better find her Asami
she’s gonna make us proud :)
I love her 😍
She’s the Avatar and you gotta deal with it!
I want a bunny so bad, please get it a play pen and all the love in the world
And so the legend of Korra begins...
I can't do it. My heart can't handle it. So cute. So good.
She's absolutely perfect!
Just when I'm sick of Reddit, the internet, life I see a post like this one and my soul battery is back at 100%

Thank you for posting

Edited cos autocorrect
This bunny will be the wise elder. "Elder Korra, we require guidance."
Make sure avatar bunny gets her ears checked often by a vet! They get terrible inner ear infections! :)
Tell me you named it after Avatar Korra.
Are they intelligent?
Will you toss her leaves being like “Korra, be the leaf.”
This post blew up! Sooo cute 🥰
Korra, the Carrot Bender
Bunatar: the legend of korra
The Legend of...Bunny Korra.
That is a very pettable bunny
Need to see more Korra
Cruel to share something that cute.
Cute!!!
PRO TIP: be very careful. By the age of 4 she will be able to bend 3 elements at a basic level. It may get chaotic, she may lose connection with all of her past lives (and Raava). Just teach her to embrace her abilities and keep her away from her uncle and you should be fine!
Hi Korra, you are very cute and you are already dearly loved by thousands of people <3
Earth, Fire, Water, Hare
**the instantaneous adoration will melt a million hearts...bunny is beautiful!**
That is absolutely, without a doubt, the cutest bunny I have ever seen in my entire life!!
She's perfect
Everyone liked that
I thought she had work in republic city
Soon she will start airbending.
Aaa
She's so cuuute!
Awww she’s adorable like mine!!!
What type/breed of bunny is this?
I used to have a bunny exactly like that, but i haven’t been able find any pictures of her. Thank you for sharing :’)
I wonder if some smaller creatures look at us as gods because of our different time dialation movements and capabilities
Korra: #1

Girlfriend: Relegated to cute meme with smoke coming outta ears n nose n all

All else: [Everyone Liked That]
The only Korra I believe in...

Thanks for this OP! It's been a stressful evening and this made it better!
Buns are cute to have as pets but they are nocturnal so you have like a few hours at night to enjoy them.
She looks more like Flopsie if ya ask me
That arm hair tho 😍
Have a ff4500 color House
Holland lips are my FAVORITE!!! Korra looks a lot like my first rabbit aw 🥺
I miss my bunny now
That's now your girlfriend's new boyfriend.
Can i steal her?
That’s... my dogs name
She's so precious
Had one bunny, then a baby showed up on our doorstep being chased by a neighborhood dog. Now we have two. They are great little monsters. They have attitude and personality out the ears. One of ours literally asks to be snuggled by my son. He has a very specific position and head movement that basically means get your ass over here and cuddle. If she doesn't get it, she takes all socks away from feet. Our other is super chill. He's a lion head mix. He just likes to sit on top of you. The very top. If he can get to the top of your head, he's there. My guess is when hoodie season comes around I'll load him in my hood and take him around. He already digs being on my shoulder while I walk around the house. 

Anyway, they are great animals. Bunnies love love. So give them lots of it.
Look at that sweet face! How could anyone NOT love animals?
Just precious.
Shame it’ll inevitably turn into an obese bunny.
it’s hard seeing others live your dream :.)
Instantly in love!!
If rabbits could water bend... I bet she could!

I'd prefer Kyoshi
I'm literally watching Legend of Korra as I'm seeing this bunny.  Awesome
Can she do the bending?
Flopsie? FLOPSIE!
Looks almost exactly like the adorable bunny I had for 10 years reborn. She was wonderful and I still miss her. She always sat next to me or hopped up on my lap.
Babeh
I want a bun so frickin bad. I always thought they were clearly the cutest of all animals as a child. Not that I didn’t love puppies and kittens. I loved everything as a child. But buns were super specials. Especially lil bun buns.
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww. T_T  

What an adorable, wide-eyed, and innocent creature. <3 <3
Belleza
My bunny's new girlfriend...
She’s cute. But she looks like she can and will tear shit up if needed.
She’s absolutely adorable.
Aww those eyes 💙 I love how she's staring up at you.
He's a cutie yes indeed, but rabbits are boring ass pets. Get a dog for Christ sake 🤣

Get busy. Those ears aren't going to pet themselves, you know.
That's something special right there. Hello gorgeous!!!!
Aww so adorable but I almost wish she had named it Flopsie instead
She controls
Fluffyness
Cuteness
Emotions
And,last but not least, manipulates hands to pet her

She's the Avatar and you gotta deal with it!
Can she earth bend?
I love the more mainstream avatar references!
Del Rio?
She never did a single thing to anyone :(
I want one so bad 🐰✨
What a cutie.
Where does one get a bunny like this? Asking for myself.
What a pretty bunny!!
Looks like a nice air bender
Look how cute the avatar is.
Make sure to clean everything. There is a virus that is effecting rabbits. Look for a cleaning product on EPA List O.
Aww so cute. Now I must get a bunny.
Honestly Aang is more bunny like then Korra
Why did you give me Momo's ears?

Those are your hair loopies!
On what quest did you find her?
Lennonthebunny on YouTube is a good source for bunny help and care if you need it :)
The sheer innocence in her eyes 🥺
😔😣😖😭 So cute
a lot of love for this sweet <3
I've heard Legend of bunnies this cute.
She's trying to recognize her new mama.

Oh she is sooo cute. She looks like she does NOT act like a bunny but actually like a puppy or child. 

... cuzzzzz bunnies be creepy af. At least the two I attempted to have as pets
I wanna squish and slap the bun. Extreme cuteness should be illegal
dedo on dedo
She knows the awwbending
So adorable! May I ask who the breeder was?
Yay!!!!!

Edit: It's expensive, but be sure to spay her (as early as possible), or she'll very likely develop destructive and aggressive behavioural issues as soon as her hormones start kicking in (female rabbits are very territorial).
She’s gorgeous holy smokes
Good gosh that is adorable!
It kinda looks like a baby Rabaroo! Very cute!
Imagine how cool it'd be to be a bunny that can earthbend.
so pretty i loved
Omgggg
My girlfriend bunny just died two days ago, please take care of it, make it so that she loves you guys, so that she has a great and full of love life^^!

(*Until the fire nation attacks, and she attacks your cables*)
good with mustard.
so cute🥰
Oh sweet Jesus I would die for her.
so cute😤❤️
Adorable 💞
My friend is asking if you want to breed the bunnies, his is a male and I’m assuming yours is female? :D
Nice little rodent.
So cute
Are you sure this isn't a Rabbaroo?
(((( Hugs )))) ❤️❤️❤️

I feel like a missed opportunity to name her flopsy
Missed opportunity for flopsy
Best Bunny ever
THAT RABBITS GAY!
Omg, I’ve decided that my next pet will be named Iroh.
Lil Bunny Foo Foo I don't want to see you....

Aww does are so special extra feisty and extra-yes. I hope she’s up to having a drama girl!
Awe I want one
That eye. That fucking eye.
You should def sell your Chevy Cruze. It’s a ticking time bomb!
Looks like a job for the holy hand grenade.
As a rabbit owner myself they tend to shed alot and awww

Make sure you get joint custody or at least visits in case things don’t work out
I was considering getting a bunny (we’ll probably two because I hear they like company) and this post made me decide to definitely get some!
our bunny looked just like that when she was a baby. she will grow bigger and get more bratty lol
rabbits are just my favorite. I have a mini lop named Ollie ❤️
Aw, she’s beautiful!
Awwwwwwww how precious!!!
Are you sure that's not a duck?
It’s illegal to be that cute. I’m calling the bunny police now.
Is she a legend?
I demand you give your bun head pats and a bite of banana on my behalf!
the avatar?
awww so sweet
Bnuuy
Adorable!! love the name!
Also known as dinner in most of the world.

I love her forever🐰😘
Imagine the poop in her lap

Shoulda named her Bum-ju
She’s a keeper
Book Five: Transformation
She's a previous onee
Bunnies eat their own poop to live...
I highly recommend setting up reoccurring deliveries of cabbage from CabbageCorp. You’ll need it! If you wanna spoil your Flop-O might I recommend first cut Timothy hay? Gonna keep that fiber high and always available :)
Looks a bit used, but cute as fuck
I want a bunny!!
r/toastedmarshmallows
please keep her cage free with a large and safe space ro play in, feed her lots of hay everyday and love her for years to come. my bunny died last october after three and a half short years, I think of her so much and it hurts...

Cute rabbit, but they are the worst pets and die suddenly and with little warning.
hello. what is the type of this bun. this is important and i must know. thank you.
kora ze waterbender
too cute bunny <3
Protect it at all cost
Watch out for the hemorrhaging disease, dont bring your shoes around the bunny and wash your hands before you pet or feed
This made me watch the series
such a beaut
The legend of Korra
Korra the explorer.
Can she bend the elements?
Careful, she might be pregnant!
Most protec at all costs
So cute


I remembered when I had bunnies to bad they not with us anymore
Where is the old bunny?
Man now i want bunny goulash
That is easily the most adorable bun-bun ive seen
One of the cutest things I've ever seen
Aww. Makes me what to go out and get a bunny. 

I'm allergic to the hay. *cries*
That’s just Bumju!
Tros mimi
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!
Does she bend????
Are things allowed to be that cute?

Epic!
Hello Korra! You are so pretty and loved already!
Shoulda named it Toph
Where did you get this cutiee my girl wants one too i need to get one
Hmmmmmm, buny
Worst pets hands down. Cute though.
Does korra smell?
They taste like chicken
Your on reddit you and I both know your girlfriend is imaginary cute rabbit tho
Where is Aang?
Nice arm hair.
Thats is one cute gay rabbit.
Your girlfriend looks weird, also the bunny isn’t even in frame, amateur photography.
https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/25843/hasenpfeffer-rabbit-stew/
What’s your setup going to look Like?
Aang >> Korra.
Aww yeah. dinner time
Bunnies are fun until the first time they piss rust everywhere....
Korea stew
Korra is crap but the bunny is cute
Is a picture of a bunny really the #1 top post on Reddit? Literally a random rabbit is more viral than absolutely anything else in the world today?

Do I have a setting wrong or something?
[removed]
I need some korra asada mmmmmm finger licking good
Hope she isn't a cunty brat like the water tribe one.
Fun to pet, better to chew.
that's cute. i wanna fuck it so bad omg
vaka.me/1238820
Is this hamster
I hope you didn't name it korra after atla.
OP shouldn't be dating 14 year olds
I see the Netflix adaptation is whitewashing.
Your girlfriend is the sex
I guess keeping it alive saves space in the freezer
She looks terrified
Burn it with fire
she need male or die ,i heard that s**t too many times , like rabbits needs couple or die , thank God humans can be single  ,otherwise i would be ... (shut up they don't care)
Have your tried rabbit before? Pretty good ngl
Why would you name it after the worst avatar
Burn it
Will never be as good as Aang
Both she and the bunny are already imagining life without you in it.
u/nwordcountbot u/HarryCL333
Unpopular opinion: Korra was the worst avatar.
[removed]
... is gunna be really fucking painful when the airbag crushes every bone in its body into your girlfriend.
Avatar sucks
I think aang is better
After seeing what a pack of wild dogs can do to a rabbit ill never seen bunnys the same again 😨
Eating shitting machines...🤢🤮 Adorably cute if you're taking a picture with it and you're only playing with it... Don't take it home!!!
Is it a disappointing kid’s show lesbian?
