These are checkins!  The dog is making sure they're doing what you want.  A very good indication of a strong connection!  Yay!

Edit: My first gold!  Thanks kind reddit stranger!  Also, RIP my inbox.
Love how he seems to get happy when he sees that you're happy
He loves you so much, he wants to share the enjoyment. So pure
I do this to my wife.
I like how do the pup is just licking in your general direction showing affection with no chance of actually licking you.
If your dog would check on me this often 2020 would be a better year
My dog used to do this. He was an abandoned pup, so I think he was checking I was still with him. Miss you Pucci!!
Pet that sweet doggo for me!
So cute! Mine will poke me with her nose in the back of my knee and when I look down she's always smiling up at me!
Think they are telling you to hurry up, they've got places to be.
Check-ins are good! He/she sees you as the leader of the pack, and they check in to make sure they are still performing good behavior and to see what they need to do next... it‚Äôs their way of communicating with you, which is pretty cool!

Our dog does the same thing with us and we never had to train her to do it either, which is nice!

Dogs that do this are usually easier to train; they just want to please their humans!

Edit: added some additional info.
Awww You still there, keep up, don't got anywhere without me
This dog is an older doppelg√§nger for my dog. This doggo has more white on the muzzle. https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/efhera/keeva_always_gets_to_open_her_gift_first_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
I walked my dog outside yesterday longer than usual. And she keeps checking on me exactly like that. I never thought to see it that way, I guess she was tired or something
My dog did this a lot, and once we trained her well enough we could let her walk the last part of our walk around the block without her leash. Very friendly pup and nice neighborhood so we never had any issues. Even when she was walking 30 feet ahead of me she'd look back every so often to see I was safe. 

Such a heckin good girl she was. Also confused the hell outta my dad the first couple times I did that, the dog would just push in the garage door and trot inside without me
I love seeing dogs do this with their people.   To me the expression is "Holyshit this this awesome and also, wow, you are amazing!"
As someone who has trained several dogs, I can tell you that his leash discipline is excellent. He is not leading you, you are leading him but he has so much confidence that he's looking back at you to go faster!! LOL He's such a good boy!!!
So sweet! My dog does this with me too. I didn't know it was a "thing."
You goof ball.. Of course hes checking on you. What if you accidentally fall through the concrete? Good thing your dog is looking out on your behalf. smh
"You see this, right? Isn't it great?"
When my dog does that I always say "Let's go on a walk!" because that phrase gets him so excited and then he realizes he IS on the walk!!
Mine will do the same. Ok not mine, my bf‚Äôs, but he checks for me every where we go, every few seconds to make sure I‚Äôm coming. He‚Äôll stop when I stop and bark so that I follow. It‚Äôs the cutest thing. 

Last week I had to go home and be dropped off and my bf needed to put him upstairs with his other brother. 
I didn‚Äôt want to go upstairs because it upsets me to say goodbye to him.
He wouldn‚Äôt go upstairs with my bf unless I came and waited at the stairs until I did. 

Melts my heart. https://i.imgur.com/YTJ4lVf.jpg
I do the same thing.
Dog looks so much like my last dog I did a double take and choked up hard. Mine did the same thing. He was the goodest of bois....

My current young pup is learning the ways. Wish he coulda met my last one.
"I'm not walking to fast for you, am I?" Or "We're still having fun, right?"
Dog: we're walkin' outside! how cool is this!
My beagle would do the same when he was still able to go on walks. Mostly when we came to a intersection and he wasnt sure which way to go. 
He also did a little check when he found trash bags in front of neighbors houses and would wiggle the tail all happy when I would reply with "Noo!!", and proceed to try to get the trash. ü§£
I miss our walks so much. ‚ù§
My dog Fat Peter did that but I think he wanted me to hurry the fuck up. I miss that little guy.
I took my dog on a run for the first time ever recently. She mostly just ran and sniffed and did dog stuff, but midway through the run she stopped cold, turned around, jumped on me and gave me a sloppy kiss. She's such a goof but I felt like she was letting me know she was having a good time!
It‚Äôs always a good time!
My heart melts when my dog looks up at me during walks. I love that he acknowledges I'm with him and he's not just enjoying the world by himself.
Your dog is using subliminal cues with every look. This dog is subliminally recommending that both of you get ice cream.
Plus it makes them feel secure.  Just like when they make eye contact when they are squatting to poop.  They're in a vulnerable position and the eye contact with you provides a sense of security.
What a happy doggo!

My dog slows down to sniff things, so I stop and then he looks at me like, "Hi, WTF are we stopping for?" and then I *swear* he looks like he laughs before he trots on. (He has really short legs, so trotting is his default speed.)
My shepherd does this too, she can even walk w/o a leash and will make sure to keep a safe distance to me
My dog does this so much it's so goofy, he will just be staring up at my wagging his tail while stumbling along.  Total goofball dog!~
My American Eskimo Floyd (Who passed in March 2018 at 15 years old) did this every time we would go for a hike. He would maybe walk 5-10 feet in front of me but always turn around and check with me. I miss that dog!
What a sweet looking dog!
Your dog looks very similar to mine, and mine does the exact same thing. Pretty funny!
My boarder collie does the same thing! My husky... Not so much.
This looks so much like my dog who passed away 4 years ago. We don‚Äôt have any videos of him. 

Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I was taking my dog for a walk a few months ago, and 2 of the neighbor dogs joined us to make a posse. (They're basically friends because all 3 of them like escaping their yards. Fear not, I live in an area with 1 back road and more yard space than houses.) One of them was this pitbull who straight up couldn't believe that I was coming along. He kept looking back like "really?!?"
I read that eye contact with yr doggoe is the canine equivalent of holding hands.
Those cute little licks when they look back, it's like they're thinking "aww, love, must kiss, want to kiss, but walkies first! Yes, walkies first, then love and kisses!"
I know the top says your dog is checking, that's true, but truth be told, he's walking you.
Yeah.  My mother in law is like that.  I call it the lost puppy syndrome.

She takes like 4 steps ahead of us and constantly has to turn backwards to see if we're still there.
My little girl pup does this too, except she has to have her nose touch you somehow whether it‚Äôs your hand or pant leg, just a quick bop every 30 yards or so!
I had a dog that looked just like that! His name was Mutley. He's been gone over 20 years, but he is not forgotten.
My partner is pregnant and our Staffy does it for her the whole walk... forgets about me
My dog does this too!!
"You okay, hooman?" ‚ù§Ô∏è
Aww the goodest boy. He loves you :)
My dog does something similar
The mlems with the look is the bestest
He‚Äôs the best
You're his meal ticket...he's making sure you appear strong enough to get back to that next meal on time!
So cute.
yes He does !
My dog does this on walks too! Sometimes she'll stop a little longer and try to lick my hand as I'm walking by
Love. Pure unconditional love.
I see some inner smile from your dog
So polite
Sup. You good ?
My dog is just concerned about finding her next hit of rabbit poop...so I guess I hot that going for me.
Oh my gosh!!  I came here to say that my husband and I have two miniature poodles, and I just now realized that this is what they have been doing on all of our walks!
Apparently, you shouldn't look at your dog when you're walking it. It shows that you're in control and not looking for your dog for direction.
Aww haha that‚Äôs really cute
Aww baby :)))
Oh yeah, if you can't keep up with him you're probably want to go back home break down and cry. Has to make sure the human is okay, exercise is not easy.
My dog does this after she makes me ski in the grass.
Thank you for making me smile today OP! I needed that :)
He‚Äôs looking back and saying ‚ÄúThis is the way.‚Äù
My dog does this all the time! More when she needs something and is leading me somewhere, I always assumed she was making sure I was still following her
I walk my dog without a leash and he always does that, and he also runs for like a block and waits for me, dogs are literally the sweetest things
Your dog likes to check in with you. This is a huge sign of a great relationship. Congrats on achieving that together.
Mine just sits and demands to be carried
Aww... reminds me of my sweet [Beulah](https://ibb.co/VCpzRSf) girl. She was with me for a good twelve years.
‚ÄúCheck ins‚Äù is what they‚Äôre called :) Means you guys have a strong bond.
I love those looks: "This is pretty fun, huh?!"
There really is no way to accurately describe the emotion you feel when you randomly catch your dog staring at you from across the room. You make eye contact and their tail starts to wag, body language shifts from engaged to overwhelmed with excitement. Then you smile, and the next thing you know your dog is flying through the air, over the coffee table to make sure they smother with kisses as fast as dogily possible. Because going around the coffee table would just take too much time. 
Love you Loo Loo.
Love it.

My roomies dog just looks and smiles at me and barks way too much all night
my puppy does this and I have to tell him "we're here for you, bud!"

my 11yo just roams free on walks
Me making sure my friends are liking the YouTube video I‚Äôm showing them
What a beautiful doggo! Love the love, OP.
And this is why dogs can be trained. They care what you think.  My cat doesn‚Äôt care if I live or die and just wonders if today or tomorrow he will eat me.
When you watch a movie you've already seen with a friend who hasn't.
What a goodest of bois
This makes my heart so happy! Your dog really loves you.
ur dog nd i cud be best frnds
He looks so dignified with his gray hair. I love old dogs.
This honestly made my day ü•∫
My dog similarly looks back at me while I'm walking her, although in her case it's usually just a look of love because she loves walks
That's nice... meanwhile my dog acts like I don't exist on our walks lol
my pup does the same it‚Äôs to ask ‚Äúam i doing good dad?‚Äù
My friend's dog does this too! When we run/walk he always looks behind to look at me. I always think he's checking on me to make sure I'm still okay because one time I stopped running (I was tired) and he instantly stopped moving when he looked behind to "check".
Your pal looks like the twin sister of my long ago pal. The exact coloring and surely the same sweet disposition. I have tears  just looking at the picture. She was the Best friend you could ask for and always wanted to be sure she was doing the right thing. I still love her with all my heart as I am sure you must love your special friend too. Thanks for posting this and bringing back so many special memories.
Mine does this too, but she stops to do it. 

Great Dane roadblock!
my dog always does this at the end of the walk after all the poops and peeps are done.  usually comes with a small hop too.
My dog stops walking if I let go of the leash. Doesn't move until I grab it again.
My fianc√©e‚Äôs dog will do the exact same thing
This is me on a date
Damn, that's dope af. 
We don't deserve dogs
"I love walking with you."

30 seconds later: "I really love walking with you."

2 minutes later: "I just want you to know, I really love walking with you."

5 minutes later: "In case you weren't aware, I absolutely LOVE walking with you!"
Just two bro‚Äôs hanging out
I love when they do that. My cat does the same thing (yes I walk my cat lol).
Good puppers
‚ÄúI am. I promise.‚Äù
*I love the walks. I hope the human likes the walks*

*Does the human need a break? Is the human okay with this pace?*
And this is fucking why dogs are better than humans
I can only imagine how horrified he‚Äôd feel if he looked back and you were gone.
He protec,

He attack,

But most importantly,

He look back.
My cat used to do this :) we would take little walks  near the house (just free, no leash), and he would look back at me every 10 seconds, meow and bop my hand ‚ù§
What a sweetie!!
I love that dopey little grin! :)
Fuck, I miss my dog.
Very good boi
I love him!
Checking to see if you are enjoying it just as much as he is.
So cute
My dog does the same thing while driving. When they look out the window they always look back quickly to make sure they're still there lol
I like your dog's slinky walk! Looks wolf-like.
My puppy dog Chewy does this too!
My dog does the same
So wholesome
That's a good dog! S/He's looking to you for validation and instruction!
Mine does the same. Sometimes he stops and gives me a nose tap too.
We don't deserve dogs.
He's looking for direction. Your inaction or even small smile or a quite "good boy" says to him he's doing what you want him to do. Cute as heck.
That‚Äôs just sweet as shit!  Made me smile tonight, and I needed it!
He is a good doggo checking on his hooman.
Who's walking who?
The pack is all, the pack is together, outside, moving, Eye contact...

Lets go!

Ever watch shows about Wild Dogs of Africa? When they are together heading out to hunt, constant contact, checking on each other, what they see, where they are heading...

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45hQfqavEgk)
He's checking for commands. And it might be a sign of hearing issues.
They can't feel the leash (it's dangling) so they're checking to make sure you're there. That look of love though... that's so good. :)
‚ÄúOh hey! You‚Äôre still here! This is pretty great, right?‚Äù
Can we already stop posting stuff about dogs? I mean we‚Äôve already seen plenty of them. Time to start posting stuff about more interesting animals.
Buddy
What a good boy. My beagle doesn't care if I'm enjoying what we're up to!
Very thoughtful!
Sweet pup, how old is he? I see those wisdom whiskers kicking in. My dog just got some greys and Im hoping he still wants walkies for a while still.
My dog does this too often and walks into things.
Precious baby.
You think you're walking the dog? That's cute. CLEARLY they are walking you, so they are just checking to make sure you have not fallen and hurt yourself.
Or making sure its still you holding the rope. Kindbofbhow like if i wasn't careful i could end up following a random lady for 5 minutes cause she had the same colour shirt as my mom wore 2 days ago.




Edit: when i was like 6
This melts my heart!!!
I used to volunteer at a shelter, dogs checking on me and coming in for mid walk snuggles was always my favourite part! I‚Äôd always hype them up and get them excited when they look at me (its rewarding for both of us) and if it was a more timid dog I‚Äôd give them some calm reassurance that they were doing okay.

This post warms my heart but at the same time makes me sad I no longer live somewhere with a local shelter :(.
"Are you enjoying this as much as I am?!?!"
Mine did this too....R.I.P. Jackie Boy!! üò™
My dog does that too lol
My doggo does this too, especially when she is wondering if she is going to get to be let off leash
Look at the slack in that leash!! Good boyy!!
When people ask you what kind of dog you have what do you tell them?
My dog does this, I figured he was checking to make sure I‚Äôm still there. It‚Äôs primarily when I‚Äôm behind him when walking through the house to head outside.
Mine does that bit too it‚Äôs utterly adorable
is it a swiss mountain/bernese? it looks a lot like my dog :D
Your dog sure does love you.
That‚Äôs good behavior. Treats are in order.
Good check in! She's looking to you for guidance!
He needs to walk on dirt, by the river, and be set free to chase ducks, squirrels, and other fuckers. Source: We are Master of this.
My boyfriends dog does this! Lovely doggo by the way!:)
Ugh I want a dog.
Or to see if he‚Äôs lost you yet.
Soooo cute.üòç
Oh I miss these. I'd often have like... Conversations? Where we'd be out on a walk and I'd be always giving him feedback (especially off leash) and wagging his tail a bit more when he's doing a good job of keeping up while also smelling all the smells.
Aw. So sweet.
My dog looks behind to see if I'm still behind her since I had the extendable leash so she tends wander off while I stay where I'm at.
‚ù§Ô∏è
God Blessed Dogg
One of my girls do this the other is always trying to get somewhere fast.
My cat actually does this on our walks as well
Whereas my coonhound gets on a scent and forgets i exist til i'm begging him to stop pulling and slow down lol
Everybody Liked That
Sweet baby
I always thought it was him going ‚Äòomg omg omg can you believe this? We are on a WALK!!!‚Äô
So cute! üòç
Signs of a well trained dog that loves you dearly. Congrats!
Aww, my doggo does this too. She loves to go for walks in the cold but it makes my nose run and if I sniffle she always checks to make sure I'm not crying lol
I'm getting, "Isn't this great? Isn't this fun? This is the best."
:D happpies\~\~\~
Mine does this too!  Super adorable.  He forgets to check on his pee mails to make sure I'm having a fun time too.
Love it when my pups do this! I usually follow up with a ‚Äúyou havin fun‚Äù *head scratch*
Not to be dramatic, but i would definitely die for him.
Is that a lucky leash by any chance?
That's a good dog.
The dog is saying, "Thanks for doing this, I know you hate this type of stuff."
Hope you are!!!!
If you love that kind of interaction, look for "K'eyush the stunt dog" on youtube, there are several videos where the owner films him walking next to her.
This makes me happy to see. Good Doggo!
That's a sign of a well-trained pup!
My Doxie does this too ...and if I'm not looking down at him I'll get a "cold wet nose on the ankle" check in
What happens when you show a bored face ?
I always assumed this was my dog mocking my slowness, especially when I was doing what I call "running" and what he would call "walking slightly faster."
Its the sweetest.  At night I'd let him walk without a leash with his light collar on and he'd run off a house or two ahead and do his thing and look back and run back to check up on me.  Then run off to the next house.  

Though when he was ready to go back home he'd sprint until he got to the door.
I wish my aussie would walk half as good as yours does on the leash.
good doggo
This is me when I'm showing someone a movie I love for the first time
That dog would put its life down for you.
Bless, they do this and it‚Äôs adorable. As if to check you‚Äôre still there
Aww good boy. A Kelpie?
Your dog is awesome. That is all.
Your dog is ensuring that a) you're still willing to go the same direction and b) you're still approving of some "wild" and wanton outdoor behavior.

He's not checking to make sure you're having a good time; he's checking to make sure it's okay that *he's* having a good time!
As a cat owner, I am always amazed when I see my neighbors' dogs doing this.  My cat never makes eye contact with me unless she is complaining about something.
Mine does this to make sure I‚Äôm even still there. There‚Äôs a big open area behind my house with a pond. I will let her off the leash and she won‚Äôt ever get more than like 100 feet ahead of me. Sometimes she gets lost and I can‚Äôt find her. Calling her never works because she won‚Äôt come to me but 100% every time if I start walking away from her, in her potential future line of sight, she SPRINTS to find me again.
My dog does this too! It makes me happy :)
That's adorable. Mine used to do the same thing!
Cattle dog mix? My parents late, sweet girl used to do this.
I never formally trained my dog but the guy listens like crazy. Always will be a good boy.
Good boi!
My dog does this all the time. Especially when we are walking down stairs.
Omg I know it's not but I saw that dog and immediately thought it was my dog my mum gave to a farm w/o my permission... if you need me I'll be crying
This is a German shepherd making sure he‚Äôs being a good good boy
My dog checks on the whole family when we go for walks together because she is a shepherd dog and we are her sheep lol.

r/woof_irl
What's her name?
My little one does this all the time. I keep thinking she's telling me to hurry up!
Mine does the same thing :-)
My last dog used to do the same thing. Even looked just like this one except reverse colors - all light brown with a black mouth. Great dog.
By implementing positive affirmation, its showing you what it likes the most, like food, it won't just look at you once to tell you it likes the food as you prepare and serve the meal. So you will walk and feed the dog more hopefully.
the dog is trying to communicate telepathically so you let the leash go and allow him to run free.
This is me watching any movie with my wife.
what breed is this?
Awww he's making sure you're still there. Sweet old pupper. Wishing you and your doggo many more years of adorable walks together.
I fucking love dogs. We don‚Äôt deserve them.
Love his/her beautiful face! ü•∞
Dogs who do the check>>>>>>>>>
My dog is just constantly trying to chase a car or bark at other dogs or eat poop
Hehehe such a cute walk!
I wish my dog did this. How do I teach her? She's fine off leave but on leash she likes to pull
That‚Äôs really cute! My dogs love to do the same thing. They get really concerned when they look back and I‚Äôm lagging behind, haha
Such a sweet boi! I love him!
Not to be over emotional or anything but I‚Äôd literally die for your dog
I wish my dog did the same when I took him out for a walk cuz all he did is running and trying to catch butterflies
My golden Shiloh used to walk at a diagonal so he could always have us in his periphery! Felt so sweet that he cared so much
When I go on hikes with her, my chihuahua likes to run off ahead a few feet and checks back every few minutes to make sure I'm following her. I love her so much more for it
What a good pup!
You did good! My girl would do this. We called her Scout. She‚Äôs run ahead 20ft, but then check in with a smile to let us know all was OK up there<3
His cute little wiggly body ü•∞
You should have looked really sad when he looks at you and fipm the reaction
That dog is checking in with you to make sure today isn't the day you take her to the vet to have her killed
He is licking his lips a lot thst is an indication of nervousness...why ? ..so see if things are good with you l suppose...you are the alpha after all.
Your pup is precious.
This made me tear up, so wholesome
What a good boy
Omg, how adorable. Our recent rescue does that as well. Also once we arrive to a street that we sometimes go down on our walks, they both look back as to ask if we could go down that street?? Once we say "ok", they jump around as if smiling,
Cute
"Hey you having fun back there? Ok just checkin."

"Hey you having fun back there? Ok just checkin."

"Hey you having fun back there? Ok just checkin."
When you say something funny and want to see if it made them smile
Awww!!! The bestest of the best!
My dog also does this! Happy to hear it‚Äôs a good thing
My dog used to do this.

Until it walked into a mailbox. And fell off a curb.

Now it pays attention.
‚ÄúWhy are you following me?‚Äù
My dog does this but she'll also stop sometimes and look at me for pets and hugs while walking haha
I wish my dog was that obedient on walks, my dog just goes crazy as soon as I pull the leash out.
This dog looks like my girl's twin!!!
Wow I hope I have a smart dog like these....
I think he's just checking that it's okay that he's leading, still a loving concern, but he's making sure he's not overstepping his bounds
So friggin cute
Awww thoughtful sweetie
10/10 would gladly pet that dog and give it lots of treats.
What breed is he
How do you get a dog to be obedient if you‚Äôre not alpha af
My Golden does the same thing!

Man this really made me miss my pup back home.
'Still with me there Windowlicker1234? Love you!'

**10 seconds later**

'Still with me there Windowlicker1234? Love you!'
Yes. All dogs do this ... BUT THEY CUTE AS FUCK EVERY DAMN TIME!!!
My deaf pup does this cuz she likes to make eye contact to be reassured that she‚Äôs a good pup :-)
Precious ‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww mine does the same
‚ÄúHuman please make this stop i don‚Äôt want to walk anymore ,-, ‚Äú
also
‚Äúhuman are you afk? still alive, ok‚Äù
Awww....
Haha mine does this too. I think it‚Äôs to make sure I am still there
My dog does this every goddamn day and I didn‚Äôt think it was good enough for fucking 36k upvotes fucking Christ
Keep up humin
He is a good boy.
Lol nah, he keeps looking at you because he wants to run, not to check on you.
I was dogsitting for a complete stranger at work, and when I took their dog for a walk she kept looking at me like this. She was glued to my hip the whole time, always waiting for me before going around corners and checking to make sure everything was good. She did the same thing indoors and I even decided to let her off leash (where there wasn't anywhere she could run off to of course) and she still stuck right by me. Easily the hardest time I've ever had handing a dog back over to its owner! I just hope I can find a dog like that someday.
he deserves some treats!!
My doggers does this too. I think its his way of checking on us and making sure we are still with him and okay.
That's a good dog. That's showing she/he has your back.
The dog is very smart, it may be watching your next instructions.
My dog does the same thing ‚ù§Ô∏è
My dog does the same thing, except with a full turn! We always joke that he‚Äôs thinking, ‚Äúoh great you‚Äôre still there!‚Äù


https://m.imgur.com/gallery/mSBqjll
made me smile
Very thoughtful gentleman.
What a smart wholesome boy.
My pupper does that too! Especially when he's off leash making sure I'm still close
Mine to
Awwwww
Well now I know my pooch isn't alone! He likes to do the same
My good boi does the same thing
I want a dog like that T_T
Mine does this, too! If he is off leash, he will run forward 10-15 feet, turn around, and wait for me to catch up. Then repeats it over and over.
my dog does the same thing! so cute
I swear I thought this was my sister or brother because we have a dog who looks identical and does the same thing. This breed of dog is a hanging tree dog (per my step dad who got him) and his a blend of different herding dogs to create a really good herding dog.
His name is Rowel and he does this exact thing because we think he is trying to herd us into going back home
My pupper does this too. Sometimes he‚Äôll even stop for a quick pat before he starts walking again. He is the best boi :3
Can cats do these?? haha
What a cute little pupper :)
The dog was trained to walk on a loose leash by giving him treats when he turned around to check where the walker was, so he still turns around as he was trained.  It is neat, but nothing particularly uncommon about this

This dog either just got, is about to get, or has reason to believe he might be about to get some treats, he‚Äôs turning his head and licking his lips to see if there‚Äôs another treat.
My dogs only do this when we have to turn around on our street to go back home. They‚Äôre like ‚Äúhey I don‚Äôt want to go back yet!!‚Äù
Mine used to do that too. I miss her üò™
Awwww my dog does this it‚Äôs the cutest thing in the world

u/zachiev2113
This is the best part of the walk! When my fam is together, we all join the walk together. My dad and the dogs are usually in front because my sister and I aren‚Äôt used to their pace. And Penny will always be looking back, checking that we‚Äôre not lagging too far behind! She loves it when we‚Äôre all together.
Aweeee
That‚Äôs a good boy!
You're Great.  I'm great.  I love you.  You're still good? Great. 

Dammit I miss my sweet boy.
Our dog does this too! But he's an anxious boy so I've always translated it as making sure I'm still there haha
*Bark Bark*

Translation: Hey owner, just checking on ya. Are you enjoying the walk? I am. Best walk I‚Äôve ever had. I hope you‚Äôre enjoying it!
Thats what I look like when showing someone a funny video
Awwwwwww that's soooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!
That is so adorable!
Is she a Kelpie?? She looks so much like our pup Shesba (who passed in 2016). We believed Sheeba was a blue heeler most of her life until we learned about Kelpies. She looks so much like our girl Sheeba. Happy happy.
Does this pupper not stray far from you at dog parks? Because my dog has those same habits.
Pet him for me.
That dog is walking you, the check ins is making sure you are following her lead. If she was looking to you for direction she'd be beside you, dogs are extremely "follow the leader" oriented.
Aww my doggo does that too!
You're their alpha.  That's what they do.
That is so cute
So cute!!
My grandparents had a dog that looked exactly like that. Only that dog had a lot of problems. When you took him for a walk you were going to get bit sooner or later. He would just be walking along, tail wagging, everything is fine, and then all of a sudden out of nowhere turn around just bite your ankle. I hated that dog.
I used to go running with my boxer every evening after work. Sometimes I was tired after a long day and if I was going slower than usual she would gently nose the back of my knee, her way of encouraging me to speed up a little.
He is chekning if you are seeing he being a good boy!!!
When I used to take my baby boy to the dog park,  before I bought him a house with a yard, he would walk merrily along and watch me walk. If I stopped, he stopped. If I ran, he ran. He‚Äôs such a good boy and I‚Äôm all nostalgic for his younger days and you have a good boy and ugh I just love it!!!
My dog looks at me to make sure I'm still running after her when she's zooming around the neighbourhood.
The only time my dog has done anything similar is when I tried taking him on jogs. He couldn't believe we were running together (more like brisk walk to him) that he would stare at me with his goofy smile and run right between my legs.
What a wonderful pupper!!!
I've noticed mine does this when she is tired and ready to head back lol
My crazy cocker does the same thing all the time. Jude will come to my door and just wait as a sign he wants to go out. I‚Äôll be walking too slowly for him and he‚Äôll turn back 3 or 4 times until we get to go outside.
My pup always does this. I think it‚Äôs because he is very fast and I am very slow so he‚Äôs checking to make sure he didn‚Äôt leave me in the dust!
My dog does this as well, but mostly to check up on me and my pace since I‚Äôm still recovering from cancer. She‚Äôs good though because if I take too long of a break or if I‚Äôm on the couch or computer too long, she nudges me and reminds me
to move and get exercise :)
My heart üò≠üíï I love when animals look up at you when you're doing stuff with them
My dog does this too! I‚Äôm currently out of town & all I want to do is go hug my dog now.
dude my boy does this too maybe 2x a walk hes such a good dog it's hard to know when to start recording but typically hes so damn happy, he turns back and jumps for joy like hes getting a t r e a t
Gosh, golly, darn. Dogs are so . . . precious. We surely are truly blessed.
When my dog looks at me on a walk she is waiting for me to ask her if she wants to go for a ride at the end.
My pup does the same thing!
Do you know what kind of mix your dog is? They look a lot like my dog growing up.
My dog looks exactly like that and does that.  I got really confused for a second and was like who the heck is walking my dog?!
What a bro. Blesshim.
My doggo does this too. I always thought she was checking to see who was holding the lead because she gets pretty shitty whenever I hand the lead to someone else.
I see this all the time when I walk past owners and their dogs, and it makes me so happy. In my head I hear, ‚ÄúHi, human, hi! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù whenever I see them look up at their owners and wag their tails.
Such a wonderful connection üß°
Why am I looking at the dog version of myself
Looks like my dog's older brother!
thats' called "checking in" and it's what good doggos do.
that's a good dog, plz pet them for me
good post op
This is adorable and made my day 120% better.  Thank you for sharing.
I will give you everything i own for the lil pupper
[you have failed the vibe check, Talloran.
That or you're calling its name and the sound is off?
 I love dogs they're the best animal on Earth
You must be a good owner, keep doing what you‚Äôre doing!
He's a good boi
Whosa gud boi/gal?
Can there be a sub of this? Is there?
Omg f-n goodest boi I love him so much
Wow.. you his bro.. he‚Äôs doing this as he knows you are pack leader.. but you trust him enough to let him lead on this walk.. hes looking back, thanking you and checking hes doing ok... he loves you.
Such a good boy !
My dog do that
I got dog and he is doing that from previous owner as he was kicking dog sometimes.
What a sweet patutee pup!
This would be miles better with windowlicker actually playing in the background.
Man, I want a dog so bad everyone in my family also wants a dog but my Mom won't agree.
What a sweetie
I wish I could like this every time they look
My dog does this so often he is looking at me for most of the walk, honestly, it gets annoying.
He spinnin in circles and shit.
Yes! Check ins! Dogs do this to show that you are in charge and they are asking both with body language and emotion "we're going this way still, right?" Its a very big sign of both respect and good training. Well done, OP. Doggo loves u.üíñüíñüëå
My dogs would never do that they would just pull me right along with them
But cute video though
 Wait so what I'm gathering is all dogs do not do this? That's super odd, especially with the top post. 

 I've walked a dates dog that I had ten minutes with who did the same thing, and the only connection I had was the leash. 

 Granted I did spend five minutes sitting on the ground. Going in for sex to have the dog start growling is a no go.
We need to downvote this to get to 69k
Why do they do that?
Boss still there? Gud gud.... Boss there? Ok... Gud.. Gud..
What a good doggo.
These are actually "speed it up, buddy" looks.
He is such a good boy. Look at that smile
Don't let your dog walk you
Cesar taught me this one. The dog is checking in to see if what its doing is what you want it to be doing. Seems like you properly discipline your dog, and aren't too nice/too rough. What you are doing is good, keep it up! You are doing well!
my jimmy dean does this üò≠üíû
Cutieeeeee. This dog loves you!
Nice doggy.
Lol awww.
Dog: Isn't this great?! This is so great.
Damn, he's in fact a good boy!
Mine does this too!!! So cute!
Party dog!
:)
Blessed good boi for checking in on owner.
Sweetheart <3
Oh god, that‚Äôs what I do when showing someone something I‚Äôm doing
Give the dog less leash.  She is trying to follow you in front of you.
My dog does it as well. Dogs want to make sure you haven‚Äôt left them. 

The most wholesome checkies I‚Äôve seen is an old lady with an old German Shepherd, dog is slowly going ahead, with no leash, and an old lady behind with a cane. Dog stops, looks back and waits for his human to catch up, and she responds ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going I‚Äôm going I‚Äôm here with you my arthritis is worse then yours‚Äù.
My doggo does this too! So cute üòç
Or the dog is checking if you are on guard
This subreddit constantly reminds me that sometimes we don't deserve them.
So sweet. Mine does the same including my leg being nudged. I always reach down to pat my good girl to let her know I‚Äôm still having a good time :)
MOMMY WHERE ARE DA CHIKINS???!!!!
My dog couldnt give 2 shits how I feel about his walk. He refuses to even look at me, he's too busy smelling every dam thing.
Plot Twist: Its checking to see if you're still holding the leash and havent abandoned it
Awww love this dog!
Mine does that, too. A little too much, so then I have to keep an eye on him, so he doesn't put his foot wrong and roll into a ditch, lol.
I have social anxiety so I look much on my dog during walks to feel calmer. 

And he looks at me much too so I feel it is a nice way to feel more connected during a walk.
Must protect
How can I train my doggo to do this
When you show a friend a movie or tv series you love
My beagle puppy is the opposite. She wont give two shits about me as she dashes off trail towards whatever catches her eye. And gets angry at me when i remove garbage from her mouth.
Reminds me so much of our best girl Molly (https://imgur.com/a/QTjtDen).  She passed on last year and still miss her so.  Hope your pupper provides as much joy as she did for us

She even had the same wiggle while she walked.  Cracked us up to see it again
Good boi
Love it
Or he had a nightmare once when he looked back it was a big scary monster walking him. He won‚Äôt let that happen
Aww
" R YOU SURE YOU WANT TO KEEP WALKING HOOMAN? I REALLY ENJOY WALKIES BUT I WANT YOU TO ENJOY TOO! R YOU SURE THIS IS STILL OK?????"
My dog does this as well. Sometimes it even gets weird when none of us are watching where to go because we are having a staring contest. Next thing i know, I'm almost in the middle of the road.
What happens if she thinks you're not enjoying yourself
My dog does this too. Makes me feel like she's walking me.
I'm sorry to be off-topic but I thought your username was 'widowlicker1234' LMAOO
Wholesome boi
My dog does this but I think it‚Äôs her way of asking if she‚Äôs walking the right direction or whatever. ü§î
Men are you sure we are spending great time üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Yeah, "checking up," more like looking back to say hurry tf up
Never had a dog not doing it even if he is off the leash he sometimes sprints forward. But always comes back to check. One time we hid behind trees so he started running all the way back. But we yelled him back and he was very happy again
Mine did the same thing.  Like saying, ‚ÄúHey, isn‚Äôt this great?!‚Äù
üòç
My dog does the same thing, all the time! 
The cutestttt
He‚Äôs got to have heeler blood! The only dogs I‚Äôve been with that are extremely involved with EVERYTHING you do! It‚Äôs changed my life in the best way.
give him a hug
Nope, he is pack leader and just checking up on his bitch to make sure you are following properly.
I wish this was original and not stolen content, unless of course you upload this every few months?
[deleted]
Actually, he's telling you to go faster because you have a rope around his neck holding him back.
We don‚Äôt deserve them. They are too pure.

"You here, you here?? IS THIS FUN OR WHAT?" "No, it's -20F and I'm dying and I wanna go back inside and play on my new PS4, take a crap already ya damn dog."
What happens if you start having a terrible time?
I have my mutt trained to do this if he wants to stop and sniff something. That way I can give him permission, or not, and thereby avoid stopping every two feet.

The licking is a submissive behaviour. 

He's checking in to make sure that you are not going to attack him. Which would be easy for you since you have him on a leash.
Actually, I think he's asking where the grass is...

Why does everyone assume "he"?
