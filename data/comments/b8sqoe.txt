He seems so focused! *ok gotta remember my training.. real gentle... here i go*
How did you teach him "gentle"? He's such a sweet boy! 
That’s a good puppy!!
why are you watching tv with a projector and all the windows open? cant see shit capt. 
True story: My parents have a sunken living room, (one of those rooms where you have to take a small step down into it) and their golden retriever, who was maybe only 8 months old at the time, would sit next to my crawling baby niece, and would very softly "hold" her hand in his mouth if he was afraid she was getting too close to the step. 

My niece is walking now, but he's still a smart, gentle good boy <3.
I got my little badass from the mean streets of a city in Mexico, I don't recall which. you had to say gentle EVERY time or she'd fiercely snatch it out of your hands like her life depended on it, which at one time I'm sure it did. she even did that in her eldest years. one tough bitch.
Are you projecting Grey’s on the wall?
Such a good command to teach. I walked a Newfie, and she would take treats so gently from my hand. That I walked terrier, and I really had to watch out for my fingers
My old girl does this. If I continue to say gentle as I hand her something, she'll got softer and softer and eventually tried to take whatever Im giving her - with her tongue. No teeth. Its amusing.
We taught our German shepherd Günther gentle so that he stops grabbing treats so hard from our hands
I tried this with my kitten when he "plays" (bites me with crazy sharp kitten teeth)....
I didn't work... But I get the last laugh because we are going cut his balls off
Our dog does that too!!!

We taught our shepherd gentle with really small treats when he was young and whenever he would try to grab something he would inhale really hard like he was trying to suck it out of your hand instead of use any teeth. 
We did the same with our Aussie, but it's "Easy, eeaaaassy". It's cute because when we do it with food he'll stick his head out, pull his lips back, and just barely grab what you're giving with his front toofers.

Then he'll turn around and run into the next room with it, plop down and go to town
Dogs take all jobs seriously because they're the best.
At my house we don't call it "gentle", we call it "take it nice".
Oh my goodness. My heart just melted. 
This is what my Mastiff does when you give him food. He hesitates a moment to make sure you actually wanna give it to him
Yeah i taught my black lab this when he gets food from someone hand, very afraid he'd take more than the food a few times when he was young, so yeah, almost the same amount of gentleness. Also moved on to train him to eat his dinner only on command. He's now 6 years old, love him to bits
Projector on a white wall with sun light hitting it🤔
Who's a good dog owner! Who is it!

You are.

🍪
High quality 
Couldn't find his breed in the comments....so what's his breed?
Give him a balloon. One of the long skinny ones that clowns twist up. My dog will ever so gently take them in her mouth and carry them around with her.
What a nice dog :) 
He looks like Scooby Do. Those teefies make me die.
Pure and wholesome boy who I’d trust with my life 
Nowww I have to go kiss my dog
Your dog is amazing. 
We were able to teach our lab mix “gentle” for receiving treats in this way- luckily labs have soft bites anyway by design- and “whisper” for when we want her to speak for a treat. She’ll bark really loudly and shrill, then I ask her to “whisper” and she’ll just barely let out a “roooooo.” It’s the sweetest thing. ❤️
My small grinch heart quadrupled in size after watching this 
Yea, "gentle" is clutch. As soon as I realized I had a big dog (she was a rescue, SURPRISE), I immediately began working on that. Also the difference between "down" as in "lie down" and "off" as in "get the fuck off of this place and my person". 
This is how you train a dog right. Great work!!
We taught out dog too so we could keep our fingers when we hand him food. It's cute how considerate they become with this
My dog does this too! If she’s in the zone and playing too hard we tell her “Nicely” and that’s her cue to slow down and be more gentle. She then gets *really* close to the object of interest and stares at it then rolls over on her back while keeping her eyes on it, but she never touches it!
I did the same because I can’t be jostled due to painful health issues. I knew our boy was going to be a fairly big dog when we rescued him and I was right, he’s 85 pounds of bouncing love at age 6. He can be roughhousing with my husband and if I slip my arm into the mix he can sense that it’s my arm and stops immediately to just lick or gently gnaw.  
Is that the episode where Izzie gets her tests done? 😩
That's the stuff I want to see when it's human and dog. You two 🤘
What a champion
My Labrador used his gently for Evil and stole eggs when ever he could. 
Your dog looks like scooby doo!
you are a good man
this made my day thank you i haven't seen my dogs in 9 long months 
Got the same projector set up in my room. Don’t listen to the hater! Best Goodwill haul I’ve ever had!
One of my goldens is so good at natural gentle - my other one is so enthusiastic, she can't help but show all her teeth in a growl face, but she still does gentle. She is just so damn excited every time. 
Thought that was a noose for a second and was very scared
My dauchound will sometimes get his toy behind the tv or too close to my plant but when I tell him "be careful" he grabs his toy and moves away 
Why does that look like a noose? 
My heart.....hurts....
Taught my sweet boy gentle at 1 month old along with ouch! 
He will still bite your hand off for a treat or while wrestling around but immediately submit if you tell him... Good on you for training bully dog's properly, they really are the sweetest if you treat em that way.
Can we see more of this lovely fellar. I was unaware of how cute i would find dogs being "gentle".
Our golden puppy is learning gentle. He’s trying really hard, but sometimes that cheese just needs to be gobbled. 
We have found him! The goodist boy!
Precious. We do "easy" with ours. 
It’s because you’re a good owner. Thank you on behalf of both him and myself. 
Kris!Is that a noose?Im calling the popo!
I love this
Projector on a bare white wall...you savage brutes
“I’ve found him! the goodest boy alive!” 
Amazing owner and an amazing pup! The double aww!
Smart!
My dog (a rescue) was taught to aggressively show affection by the kids who abandoned her.
I understand that when I come home, she attacks me to show love, but it’s been very slow trying to retrain that out of her.
We taught ours “like a lady.” So Ruby very gently take everything out of our hands and trots away. 
he's such a good boy! I love him.
what a good puppers!
Och, what a gentleman :3
My dad does this with our dogs too :) 
More gentles please!
Gross is that a projector going straight to a wall in a bright room? You animal!
OMG THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I’VE SEEN ALL DAY. What a good boi 😭
He is so sweet! I just need to teach mine to fetch... the bandaids. #puppyteethsuck
He’ll make a good husband some day
Yes a good boy!!! 
it's so rewarding when they get there.  Been working hard on this with my pup and he is now working really hard to stay gently, I can see him fighting his instinct.

&#x200B;

can see you put a lot of time into this lucky doggo.
GOOOD BOY I WOULD DIE FOR THIS DOGGO
I’m terrified of dogs because I was attacked about 10’years who but I still love them and I just want to hug your good boy. 
Damn that's some karma. Well deserved, way to train a calm and beautiful boi
What a delicate little house hippo! Pitties are the smartest little angel babies :)
Extremely good boy. Give him an ear skritchee for me, please.
Our doggo is like that when our kid plays with her. There's a very obvious difference in how much effort she uses when playing with us vs playing with K. 

She will drag my husband across the house with a rope toy but when K grabs it, K pulls her and she will take a small step back, but not pull hard. 

Congratulations on such a good pupper! 

I love him 😍😩

serious question: how do you teach a dog "gentle"? Do you just say "Ah ah! Gen-tllle! Gennnn-tlllle!" and they sort of figure it out because they're mammals and the sound of your voice is something nobody understands how it works anyway? 

Or something else?
My black lab does this! Tell him “gentle” and he peels his lips back and gently grabs the treat, or whatever I’m giving him. 
Aw look at it waiting to rip a child apart! Sooo cute!! Fucking nasty ass pits
GAH!! Love this. Pits are such babies. Screw people who say otherwise.
Our Lab came with that software preinstalled. 
He will gently rip your arm off...
The complete opposite of my 1yo pitbull mix.. How did you train him to be such a good boi?? 
This is so sweet 😭😍 by the way, how old is he? It looks like he's got a little gray by the chin but his teeth look fantastic for an older dog!
[deleted]
Awe this is great!
Do you enjoy a projector over a tv 
what kind tv is that background
This is just wonderful all over
My dog used to do this and he would get so excited when going in for the toy that his teeth would chatter
Aw I taught my dog easy from a young age and he’s so good with it
This is going to be a little off topic but is that the Night Shift playing in the background? I literally just binged that show over the past 2 weeks. 
Where’s the egg trick, show’em pits are more gentle then Golden retrievers!
There's a ghost on your wall
( ( ( *soft gentle nom* ) ) )
Slow cromch 
Okay this is amazing. How do you teach a dog "gentle"?
Awww
Atta boy! 
well trained
Zum 
Is that a projector in the background? Pretty bright for daylight
Best trick I ever taught my dog! 
Good boy!
What kind of breed is he?? 
What kind of breed is he?? 
Hahaha reminds me of my boy. I taught him the same thing when he was a puppy because I knew he was going to be strong when he was older. If you say "gentle" he walks over really slowly, focused on the toy and at about half the speed of this dog grabs it with his front teeth only
[deleted]
Nice! My old lady pupper knows this command as well and I use it when hand feeding her treats. Gotta love smart pups. 
My favorite commanndddd
We taught my to only go to his food when we say yes... my dad would not say it a for good minute after setting it down just to show that the training worked
He took such a dignified and docile chomp.  Classy pup is classy!
Gemtle bite. Sof bite. 
The projector is blocked by the sun.
His teeth is better than mine :)
What sort of dog is that?
And as a reward: karma
My old dog was the same way when you gave her food. She would just use her lips when taking food from your hand. I miss her. 
What a good boy, I loved how slow he was to take it. 
My grandfathers dog is really careful with carrying things too as she was trained for it(hunting dog). She is super happy when she gets to carry stuff arround, when i park my car in our courtyard she goes nuts until she gets to carry my car keys or my wallet inside. On sunday she always comes with us to carry over the rolls from the local baker(we put a plastic bag arround the paper bag so her saliva wont get on it,yes we reuse the bag)
Mine know be nice. My oldest does the same thing. He loves food the most so he knows that if I feel teeth it goes away so he will go for it then back up try again back up and repeat for a few times then he will oh so gently take it from my fingers. He’s a good boi too!  Such a sweet puppet you’ve got!!
seems like Grey's anatomy :D
Oh man, my Rottie was like this as well!
“Gentle” is what I said when I gave him a big ol milkbone treat and he would literally give the smallest bite to where he took it from my hand and then gave it that hard chew to break it. 

Love big dogs. <3
This shit's so fucking weird. 💗
Where did you get the TM?
We did the same thing with my pups and their treats, but we used "nice" instead.
Reminds me of my old pup...Rest In Piece Magneto. 
I thought that was a hanging rope
We taught our dogs "gentle" too! It's mainly for playtime when there's 100 lbs of dog brawling in the living room.
He’s better trained than me....
My dog does that too! It’s super cute
One of the most important commands in my view.
Why do you have my dog?????? 
My question is... Why is there a projector in your room

P.S: YOUR DOG IS SO CUTE I JUST WANNA HUG HIM ARGHHHH
What a gentleman. 
Oh my god my dog looks almost the same, just darker and does gentle the same
*pitbulls are vicious animals*

/s
That's a good boy right there!
One cool dog yo
That face. SO gorgeous. 
You just cut when he would realised that he did it perfectly and would jump everywhere of happiness

Dogs are truly smart. 
My boxer that passed away last Christmas was like this up until her last few months. Would lick the treats you’d give her out of your hand as not to hurt you, would gently bite chews out of your hands.
In her last few months she was on steroids and would nearly take your hand off half the time unless reminded. As soon as you told her, she’d panic and have an ‘oh fuck’ moment
My dog that passed 2 months ago used to know gentle too. However, I’d be able to put a whole toy in his mouth before he decided it was okay for him to bite down gently.
Thank you
M O N C H
best boy
Is that Grey's Anatomy in the background, OP?
I always had to remember "gentle" to my dog when it was with food. That greedy mutt. Miss her!
That is great ! I use 'Calm' :) 
Can’t take the bite out of a dog, but looks like you managed to take the ruff outta him. 
My husky takes it very serious 
Hi, can you give me any tips, I'm not moved out by myself yet, but I really wanna have a pet cat and dog and ideally would love to train them both to be gentle just like this. Id really appreciate any advice. Thanks
If only humans were like this
I love dogs' wrinkly chins. 
I have Danganronpa flashbacks, for some reason...
We did exactly the same with my mam's Westie, except we used the phrase 'be nice'. This was because she was a puppy growing up around my (at the time) baby son and his 6 year old brother.

Like yours she used to take is so seriously. Didn't matter what it was, say 'be nice' and she would calm right down, go all soppy and be very gentle. This was accompanied by educating my boys in how to treat animals with respect and kindness as well.

My boys are in their 20's now and my mam's dog passed a couple of years ago, but they grew up best friends and that dog is a missed. Such a useful thing to teach a dog at an early age.
I have a black lab like this, shes had some of her stuffed animals for 8 years now.
Bow bow
Sweet dog
It's nice that he's so gentle with it, but, does he like playing with the rope? I mean isn't the idea to tug at it? He kind of just looks like he isn't playing and is just performing a trick. :(

It's like watching a 5 year old kid slowly trudge out to a playground for recess. 
He is the goodest boi
Good job!  He's beautiful.
Arent these breeds the Mike Tyson of dogs? 
He is precious ❤❤❤
Can you do the White Fang thing where you put out your arm and he it in his mouth?
There's a ghost on your wall


He’s got nice teef
That's awesome! Beautiful pup
Awww my pibble used to be sooooo gentle when taking treats from me, just like yours and his rope toy! We don’t deserve doggos 
Nice
I did something similar with my pup. Taught her “easy” and “do nice”. Easy twins her in when she runs and plays like a psycho. Do nice helps when we wrestle.
My pups does it too. The sweetest appreciation, but once she is allowed it all hell breaks loose!! My toy, my bone, my treat!! Yes yes yes!!,
Haha my dog also takes “gentle” very seriously.
I squeeze his penis when to his mouth
What a sweetheart ❤️. My dog Jenna was so gentle with everything too. You would give her a treat and she would take it so gently you would think she was taking it from a sleeping baby lol.
It looks very careful. It's so cute.
Good dog, good training 
How adorable
I watched this four times, he's just so cute.
I love your dog huhu
Did anyone else say “good boy” out loud when he got it?
Currently on vacation and I WANT TO PET AND HUG HIM( I miss my pups )

He is gorgeous! 
Aww
Shout out to Instagram account @dogseatinggently for this type of thing
Bruhhh momentm
I'm so conflicted. I don't know whether to "aww" or cry with laughter
Great job! So important, especially with those breeds
Pitbull eyes are so soft, my dog breaks my heart on a regular basis. I literally have to stop playing with him sometimes because he's just too goddamn sweet I gotta pick em up and hug him
Oour 🥰
That’s how my puppy (she’s 4 now she’ll always be a puppy) grabs treats. It’s hilarious, She’s been getting better with toys but she was still going hard after those for awhile 
Amazing
Aw, I did the same with my boy when he was young. He would take it so seriously that you would have to put the toy in his mouth because he would want to be so gentle with us. He passed away earlier this year after 14 wonderful years, but I'll never forget this, thank you!
Someone may have asked this but as someone who’s never owned/trained a dog. How does one teach a dog to grab something gently?
Aww such a sweety! Amstaffs are a really good breed. The thing is they have a powerfull character and need gentle teering. Which is not meant for everybody.

But, these dogs have such a big heart!! Wish more people would see that.. 
I do this with all my dogs too. I give them leeway if I am rough housing with them. But I say "take it nice" they know, or they don't get it.

Good job! Gentle pups unite! 
Are you watching grey’s anatomy?
Good boi

Hehe
So gentle it makes me wanna kiss him
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
My pittie is the same way, she is so nice about taking things, my Chihuahua mix, not so much 
Waww
Our dog does the same thing and if you go ahh gentler she will open her mouth so slow and barely bite whatever it is
My Rottweiler was much the same! 

He would take food ever so softly from my hand. Never failed to make me laugh as he was quite a big dog, 80+kg.
^^^nom
So cute
It's more than gentle😘
I taught my dog gentle.

 Now she’s too gentle. She won’t take food from my hand unless I literally let go- which results in it hitting the floor a lot.

Not only does she bite gently until I’ve let go, but she refuses to apply any pressure when pulling it away.
I want/need a dog !!! 
JESUS LORT LOOK AT HIS TEETH!
A friend of mine taught her dog to "take it nice" so he wouldn't snap food out of her hand. Occasionally this means he uses the itty bitty front teeth to take a single potato chip from her, and it's adorable.
He is beautiful

My dog is like that too. If you were to just hand her a bone or dog cookie, she'd do the grab-and-run. If you tell her "gentle" first, she will very slowly/softly take it from your hand (and then run off)
Sweet boy, gentle boy. 
What kinda dogo is that beautiful!! 🐶 
Real meaning of a "good boy"
I've done this too! Bully breeds are such great family members! 
My retriever is like this with everything we give him; food, treats, toys. The second it's out of your hand and in his mouth though, he goes crazy.
Is that scrubs?
Despacito
The sweetest 
Taught my dog this because my friend has 4 young children and I didn't want my pup to get all amped up and take something from them a little too hard and have them cry and him get pissed.
Our English Mastiff does this too, it’s so precious.
Gentle is my favorite. Even though I have a smaller dog, still hurts when he gets you. 
I did this with both of my dogs too!! They would always get too excited for treats and Viola would nip my fingers. She’s still crazy but she at least knows “gentle” 😂
My staffy learned this super early on and never bites hard on anything now. He is also shit at playing tug of war because he never pulls, only holds on
For mine the command word is 'easy'. Manly used to give him treats and not have him take my hand off
^n ^o ^m ^f
Our boys know gentle to! Especially needed when giving them treats/snacks so they don’t bite our fingers off LOL
What a good boy. 
[removed]
Who's a good boy?!
Looks like my dog but not as fat.
awww this is so freaking adorable!!!
So precious. My oldest dog does this, but I don't think I ever actively taught him to do that. The only thing I can think of is whenever I'd take something out of his mouth that he wasn't supposed to have (food, plastic, tissue, etc...), I would sort of fold his lips over his teeth so I could pry his mouth open without hurting myself. I think he just learned that his teeth hurt, so he's more careful. 
What kind of projector do you have?
Beautifully done. Good boy
Your tv is on the wall? 
My dog does this exact thing when i say 'be sweet' and its the best thing I ever taught him!
I need a pit bull in my life like this one.
I love his big ol pittie head. He's so cute ❤️
sweet dog haha. 
My dog does this when I say “gentle” and I feed her a treat from my mouth. Not as gross as it sounds, I promise. Super sweet. 
My dog does this with treats.
What a sweet boy 
I thought it was being thrown at him in slow motion at first
Haha yeah my pit does the same thing. Will stare at a toy forever until I say "Get it!"
This is extremely adorable.  Good boy 😍
I do the same thing, our keyword is “easy”. My dog used to bite my hand when I gave her food, not any more
I taught my baby 'take nice' ..... I probably should've went with gentle. 
Awwwww. I taught my pit "slow". So he does the same exact thing. Except I say "sloooow". Great job!
Aww. Pets from me please. 
Mr. Serious wrinkle face
I like your TV set up!
Awesome training, awesome dog! 
Such a gentle sweetie. ❤️
Awwww man, your dog just made my heart melt, what a darlin.
We taught our dog this as a puppy too, it's more useful than sit and stay to be honest, especially with a baby in the house.
The gooddest of boi's. 
Our two Goldens (one half Aussie) know Gentle and will grab threats from you like this. Our other that we adopted last year who is older is a freaking shark lol. You'll loose a finger.
what an **absolutely** ***GOOD*** **BOY**
So cute! Needed this video today :)
Awww!!! What a sweetheart!!!

&#x200B;
such a beautiful animal
Hes a good boy :)
I love him.
I do this with one of my cats. Every time he tries to bite my hand, I say “nice” and he then proceeds to lick it instead. Lol!
Such a gentle boy♡
Aww that’s so cute
My dog is like this too haha
We taught my two old pitbull/catahoula mutts "easy" so they would be this gentle. They took it super serious like this beautiful boy. It was one of the best things we taught them so we wouldn't lose fingers when giving them a treat or handing them a toy. 
I have taught my guys “gentle” as well.  My newest guy was a stray and underweight.  We labeled him as an “enthusiastic snacked” so not his fault but it still hurt.  Now he takes the smallest of kibble so gently from my hand. 
Ok, legit though, what's going on with the projector?

I want to build a projector setup in my basement. Does the wall work ok? I was trying to bypass buying a screen.
That's a gentle boy
no mad only gentle lol
Now that's a good boi!
I wish there was a sub for this! 
My black lab is a super gentle, sweet boy. I can hold a pretzel in my mouth and let him take it, and he is so sweet not to touch me. It sometimes takes a minute because he has to be sure he's being gentle
Sweet pupper. ♥️
My pittie does this too! Sweet, gentle moose! ❤
Precious baby! 
Ayyyyy you do the same thing I do with my projector. Never buy a TV again. 
Taught mine "easy" when giving her treats and food. She goes so slow that you practically have to put it in her mouth.
What a good boy! Seems you've done a good job training your doggo.
We taught "nice paws" to our cats when they were kittens in an attempt to get them to put their claws away while playing with people.  We later learned it was just the tone of our voice, as we were about to say other phrases like "hem haw" and "base ball" and they'd put their claws away.
SO CUTE! <3 
Someone make this into r/animaltextgifs!
What other three moves does your pup know?
My dog is good when you say "nicely" when he's taking food out of your palm
If I say gentle a lot my dog will just stare at whatever I'm holding 
This is adorable! Brings back fond memories for me. 

I taught my family dog 'gentle' as well back when she was around.  When we got her she was super food aggressive and nipped at people if they reached near her when she had a bone or food.

Slowly changed her attitude with positive reinforcement until she would grab things just like this dog. So rewarding to teach them to be this polite. 
I taught my lab 'take it nice' and she'll still put your entire hand in her mouth, but very softly, so I guess that's nice? 
What a gorgeous baby 
aww im trying to teach my pup to be gentle, but her mama is a demon and plays really rough so its hard dgdjdj
My dog has know “gentle” too. He will won’t take food from you when you hand it to him, instead he will nibble it.
I did similar with my Babs! Such great breeds! I’m still teaching my GSD gentle hahah babs is numnumnum GSD is all ONNOMNOM 

What a good boy! <3
oh that darling little face trying so hard to be as good as possible <3
Such a gentle boi
Awww...my dog did that too. If you offered her a treat and said "please be very gentle", she would almost peel her lipsback to take it from you as gently as possible. Makes me miss her so. 😭😭😭
He looks like my Louie ♥️
Always the first thing I teach pups. Its actually been harder to teach the human pup then it was the dog.
😭😭😭 he's too perfect
Wow...that's a smart dog!!
My dog does this with food. We trained him to take food or treats from people as gently as this and he never snatches things from anyone.
Such a good boi!!!
how good can a good boy possibly be
Love this! I’ve gotten my boy to be able to take mini treats from me while I hold them with my teeth and not harm me a bit.
Viscous animal!!!!! Uncontrollable monster!!!
more of this doggo pls
My bully is like this. 

My schnauzer has 6 teeth and I swear she uses every one of them in an attempt to take off your fingers when you give her something. 
I taught my dog "easy" and she does the same exact thing. It's the funniest thing ever. 
His big ole floppy mouth is so sweet!
😭❤️
I'm still trying to teach my husband this. 
[deleted]
My girl does this too. Sometimes she’s so gentle that I just have to shove the treat in her mouth because she’ll just let her teeth glide off of it. Lmao. 
What a sweet boy!😻💙
He's VERY gentle! Good boi
I taught my brother's corgi gentle as well! Cutest thing ever. What topped it was 'whisper.' I would command 'speak' and he would bark, but then whisper to him "whiiispeerrr," and he would let out the tiniest little squeak or even better open his mouth and make a barking motion, but nothing came out.

After he left to live somewhere else with my brother the training wasn't kept up and he forgot whisper :( sad times.
SUCH A GOOD DOGGO!!! What a sweetie!!!! ^_^
2nd best part of the video was I was able to figure out what show you’re watching. Greys anatomy. Early seasons cause if I’m not mistaken that’s George 
It always shocks me that people don't teach this to their dogs. All of my family dogs always had the "take it nice" command. One dog wouldn't even take food with her teeth, she'd stick her tongue out and try and take it like a giraffe, lol. It's super important. What if some kid tries to feed your dog a treat and they rip their hand off because they have no manners?
Gentle is just as important as any other command in my book
We taught our one year old daughter "gentle" when petting the cat so that she doesn't get popped after smacking the cat. Of course in her tiny head she concluded that gentle means soft pets to hair, so if I tell her gentle when she's slapping my arm, she then starts petting my head. 
What a cute dog. Very obedient.  Love dogs
 They are the best companions. I did the same with my dog.  Dogs are so clever.
He looks like my Toby ❤
Lol i just imagine a home intruder and your dog just softly trying to bite him.
Is this a pitbull?
My equivalent was "nice bites!!!" I miss that dog.
Is that Jussie’s rope?
Okay OP I have question, any advise on training a cat to follow the gentle command
can you make a video demonstration on how to teach a young puppy to be gentle? 
I taught my golden/boxer mix “be nice” when taking treats. It normally works pretty well and she will attempt to take it as gently as possible in her excitement. 
Awh. We've taught all our dogs "easy" and they've all taken it just as seriously. It's so sweet. My mum's bigger one (she has two purebred boxers) is so gentle, you can give him less than 1cm to take something from you and his teeth will never touch your hand.
Taught my Jack this too.  Specially because he received a lot of treats from kids when he was little. 
Humans don’t deserve Pibble doggos!!!!
My Great Dane understands “Be Sweet”.
That’s so cute! I love how he looks at you for approval
Lovely! My ridgeback needs constant reminders to be gentle. 
Cromch
Slightly off topic, but I have that same blanket!
My command was "be nice" it works on my dachshund.
Oh my, that's a really good boy :)
As gentle as a mama crocodile carrying her young. What a good lil woofers you have.
My oldest dog is so gentle she’ll take a cookie out of your hand using the skin of her teeth
Good boy
The best boi, now actin like gentleman. 
Is he a pittie? He looks so similar to [our guy](https://imgur.com/a/E7ELEnY) we adopted last month. we were told he’s a retriever mix but he just looks like a little pit bull, he’s the sweetest and has a gentle nibble like that 😁
butter wouldn’t melt in that mouth!
Omg what a sweet and good boy!!! He deserves all the bellyrubs in the world!!!
That’s what I’m teaching my 10 month old
My mum’s Rottie is brilliant at this. We trained him using apples as a treat and he still takes them sooooooooo gently it’s super cute. 
statistically most severe dog bites in the US. are from Labs, followed by German Shepherds,..natl. emergency room stats & police reports.....former ER doc & volunteer firefighter.
Thats amazing
I have a question. Please do not get upset. Owning a pitbull, do you find it more challenging as far as obedience training is concerned?
what a cute pupper!
What a good boy! And those teeny little front toofers!!! They’re my favorite. 

Give his forehead a kiss for me!
Look at those teefs!
What a very gentle and patient good boy.
Omg sooooo cute what a good boi 
Omg I love it! I taught my Pit the same thing and it’s still always so cute to me when he does it 
What a good boy! He's so sweet.
He's so sweet!
 What a good boy!!! Give him a pat from me and tell him the internet loves him. He’s just darling. 
So so cute
I did this with my two dogs. You’ve got an upvote from me 
Gentle....gentle......gentleee yaaaaas did it
My dog is like that.. she got soookef when she was a puppy because we were playing with a toy and her little puppy teeth sliced into my finger when she got too close to the other side of the toy. I screamed in pain (not at her) and she was startled, since then she takes things very delicately.
Хи хи
wow
ha ha ha .. its funny man
Oh hey I am rewatching Grey's Anatomy too 😏
r/fixinghistory 
That nostril flare.
Your finger nails are interesting btw
Errrmaaagerrrsh - he’s the gentlest, sweetest, goodest boi ever
What a lovely boy!
I taught my golden gentle too and he can be playing roughly one second and as soon as he hears gentle he will be licking the shit out of you. Dogs understand more than we think 💞
Our westie developed this by herself. If she’s chewing someting and you say ”be nice” (roughly translated from my language) and she starts licking instead of chewing :)
Oh my god. My dog does this. Up to the point he takes a little snack out of your hand without touching you. Sometimes, he gets something from a fork - and you could safely eat from this fork again. It‘s the cutest thing ❣️
The goodest of boys
He is so handsome and smart! Such a pretty color coat. 
thats a good boi
This is just beautiful 
Good boy
The little teeth ❤
aaawh cute
Whatta good boy!!!
So sweet!! Big, thoughtful doggos are the best kind of doggos!!!
Good boi
What a gentleman.
My dog does a similar thing. He will either chomp at something furiously or, if told to be careful, he will gently put his front teeth around an object and slowly move his head back. 

It's a good thing is so small or he would ripped my arm off at this point. 
I had a dog that used to do this all the time. The funny thing is she was the aggressive dog of the bunch. The other dogs would bite it quickly out of my hand, then theres this one dog that would do exactly this. I miss those animals. 
Beautiful dog 👍👍👍
My heart has MELTED
He looks so cute when he shows his little teeth
THIS DOG IS SO BEAUTIFUL
Oh my gosh! My pit does the same thing when you tell him gentle, his mouth literally trembles because he's trying so hard to bite down softly 😂 
Bestest boye🤩
That’s a good boy!
My staffie does the same thing :D
Love this! I think there is no such thing as a bad dog.  A little training, patience, communication, and love with a puppy will build something beautiful for life.  Well done
Try the egg thing that goldens can do
Aww my puppy does this too!! So funny 
Awwwwwww sweet baby!!!!!!
That CLOSEUP!
Ok... For the love of God... Let me get this right.
95 % discipline 5 % relaxation 🤪
My dog is the same with food. She is half pitbull half boxer. She's a huge dog and normally will scarf up food, and as a 180 pound man I sometimes lose tug of war cause she is so intense, but she is a very gentle dog. Whenever I give her treats I tell her to "take it nice" and she basically does this exact thing. Though the moment she has it she is munching on it ravenously. 
That boy is the goodest boy
So cute how he looks like he’s looking over to see if he’s doing a good job. 
My friend had a great dane who knew "gentle" very well. You could say "gentle", hold a small piece of cheese in your mouth, and the dog would very carefully take it out of your mouth. My friend got another dog, a german shepherd, and I asked "does he know 'gentle'"? My friend said "I'm not sure, try it."

Thanks, buddy.

I love him 
What a gorgeous boy. 
Good boy!
You know god damn right who's a good boy. 
Good boy!
This convinced me my dog is part pit. He looks exactly like that, only he’s 15 lbs, a lighter brown with slightly longer hair than that
Holy cow. My Luna looks identical to him. She learned it super young too and she takes it more seriously than anything else. What breed is he? 
A double booping, 'cause he's such a good boi!
Omg, my heart just did that happy fluttery thing. I'm in love.   Please give this pupper a nose boop and scritch behind the ears for me?  Beautiful gentle doggo first class. <internet hugs!!!>
I think it is pretty easy to teach this a dog. But it's a basic command like "stay' that you need to teach before you can go on with other things. I've been trying to teach my dog to do a roll and stuff, but he was always moving like a crazy whirlwind. So I decided to teach him to calm down, at least physically, by removing toys more and more when he was moving and moving them slowly towards him, while he didn't move at all. It took him some time to understand, but at the end he was able to freeze 100% while i was telling him "slow" even if i was holding his fav food in my hands. It's very usefull for some different lesson.

The dog is adorable. 

P.S. Which beamer/projektor are you using to watch?
Arent they all like this? I have two shepherd's that snap anything that resembles food out of my hands... including my fingers. Meanwhile my two pibbles take with the soft of their lips. We always yell Take Nice to the germans. And Take Agressive to the pibbles. They just have it in them TBH.

Because he loves you with his entire being 
I wonder if making him be momentarily gentle with a toy he's meant to fuck up is a wise move. 
Awww... such a good boi

“Every know and then, i let him... go crazy... and go stupid... aahahhahhahahahhah... go crazy, ayea...
I just want to cradle his gentle flaps.
Is no one going to mention that’s the upper part of a noose?
