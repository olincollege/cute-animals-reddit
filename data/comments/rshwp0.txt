That is one of the cleanest goats I’ve ever seen.
Goat has the biggest smile :)
The goat looks like he’s having a good time too.
Look at that lil marshmallow!
I hope they stay friends, both look so happy.
Wait, is he holding that kid by the bollocks?
It hurts to see other people live your dreams
This is the best pic ever.  That goat is so thrilled with itself! Love!
They both look happy.
Your friend has a nice goat hold technique - cradle the balls and palm the anus.
Your friend has the most perfectly straight teeth I've ever seen.
this might be one of the best pictures I've ever seen
I miss having goats. Them and pigs are the barnyard equivalent to dogs. Great, smart animals, and they always get into mischief when they're younger like puppies.
It's a boer! They can be very friendly and intelligent, they're also amazing escape artists. He can find where it came from by the tag in it's ear
It looks like a stuffed animal! This is ADORABLE
Your friend is pretty cute too
Omg those smiles!! This picture makes me happy:)
Among photos, this one is easily one of the Greatest Of All Time.
This is the best photo I have seen in a while, your friend looks like a happy person.  Great to see!
Goat say cheeeese
Very clean goat
Everyone smiles like they when both of their balls are held
This is beyond adorable op. Look at those smiles!
that is one fluffy little guy
Is that a penis or a thumb?
Damn look at those nuts.
Omg my heart 😍🥺💕
Why’s he holding its gussy?
They both look so happy lol
They both have the same look on their faces.
I wish a goat like that would follow me home too!
He grabbed that mf by the balls
Great pic! It’s one way to,keep your grass cut!
Goat looks so happy here
He looks like he’s smiling ❤️
They both look so happy!
I want to be best friends with both of them!
So you have your own kid now? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Well that’s just adorable!!
They’re the cutest buddies lol
They're smiling
Y’all are so photogenic!
your mate be touching goat balls
Both seem pretty comfortable with hand to genital contact.
Your friend should adopt it. But tell him to remove his hand from the goat's testicles. 🤣
[deleted]
Is that a thumb or….
How is his girlfriend gonna take it when she finds out he has a kid?
Please tell me I’m not the only one who thought the guy’s finger was the goat’s thingy
but why is your finger there?
i work with him!!! he gave him a bath and ALL!! such a sweet man
Unfortunate thumb placement. 

Thought that was his 🍆
That goat has a cute belly.
Goat got a reach around for his troubles good business.
Lol that thumb is not in a great spot but it's a sweet pic
I had to double take there not gonna lie
And the goat is just chill with being picked up?
This is a life goal right here.
Such a happy goat!
It almost looks fake haha
The GOAT and the goat.

Sounds like a new sitcom.
The GOAT holding a goat
This is the good type of positive the world needs, not that other kind!
The goat has found it's partner. You have no choice but to accept him.lol
So cute!
It even got the whole Dreamworks smile down.
Look mom this goat, he followed me home, can I keeeeep it?

&#x200B;

No Man! you take that goat back to where you stole it right now you a bad boy.
Your friend has a goat now

They're both so happy!
The goat's smile is as big as yours!

Tyrese Gibson? Nah, I like your smile better.

That was ballsy.
Don't touch the goat scrote!
That is the best goat in the world
That’s a happy ass goat :)
That’s one big…thumb
Why you grabbing it by the balls?
You goat to be kidding?
Guess it's your kid now.
That is the cutest goat belly I’ve ever seen
r/holup
I can’t be the only one who thought his finger was something else
I thought the goat was packing for a second
This picture is awesome. They both have such happy looks on their faces and look so thrilled to be hanging out together.
this most adorable shit i ever saw
The finger placement is questionable
[removed]
The goat’s smile!
He’s low key smiling cause your boy cuppin his balls

The goat’s smile and your friend’s smile make this picture so wholesome

You mean, he goat followed?
I have pet goats and I can confirm, they love following people around
where's your friend's hands at?
cute goat, though
Why is his hand there?
Sometimes your just gotta grab life by the goats balls
The way he is holding the goat… omfg I’m DEAD 

Just look at the goat’s FACE 🤣🤣
I thought that goat had a BBC for a second
Why does this goat look like it just got a spa treatment, softest non scruffyiest goat I’ve ever seen.
The nuts to shaft ratio seems off unless the goat has an outie of a belly button
Lucky guy, what a babe!
I'm not an animal scientist. I thought his thumb was... Something else at first glance.
I like how your friend is gently cupping the goats balls, keeping these sensitive testes from accidental harm. 

He seems like a good bro, who I would trust my balls with anyday.
A pic of a cute goat and all anyone can talk about is it’s balls..seriously?
Followed him home the whole way in his arms. Same way my brother “found” a cat. We all know what’s goin on here. Dude just wanted a pet goat. It’s all good!
You’re kidding me
fucking. adorable.
ITS FUCKI G SMILING Ahhh it’s too cute all of it!! high key hope your friend keeps the baby!
Goats are just hoofed doggos, and they deserve afterlife paradise just the same.
They look like friends. Apparently the goat gained a little holiday weight in that belly.
Happy goat
It’s smiling?
OMG THAT GOATS SMILE HOLY SHI-
They both look so happy! Best friends
Goat is like 😊
Jesus man how are you lifting Michael jordan so easily
![gif](giphy|3bc5MV3VkOpMI)
I thought that was his dick lmao
Took me a while to see that it's a human finger
That big smile on the goat's face is ABSOLUTELY PRICELESS!!! 😇😇😇💕🥰❣️
How did his fluffy nuts feel on your hand? Lol
Lord forgive me for what I'm about to do
Both of their smiles are precious
The goat looks happier then he do
r/Holup
The way the goat looks like he’s smiling :)
Goat almost as clean as your mates outfit
I'm going to get a job now just in hopes that a goat follows me home from it.
That goat looks so happy 😁😁😁
Both are ridiculously photogenic
Is that his thumb?!?
That thumb tho...
Aww…they’re both smiling. And that cute little belly button 🥰
I see that as Mutton Biryani, Goat Curry and Kabobs followed your friend.
Not going to lie; where you've got your hand placed makes it look like the goat has a big black penis.
Bet you zoomed in too
I first thought his finger was something else.
Homie found a good meal
Omg I literally thought that guys hand was a goats penis at first
I freaking love goats. We used to raise them when I was younger and I just want to hug them anytime I see one (despite the smell). 

Also, that dude has an awesome smile and looks like an amazing human. 🙂
The goat seems happy with the smile on its face lmao
Love the goats smile
For a second I mistook the finger for something else but wrong sub.
Absolute Goat.
Blacked
The goats smile 😂🐐
Cradles the balls with experience
He got a finger up that ass
Happiest looking goat ever.
Oh to get chosen by a goat
Soooo cute! Thats someones baby! I hope you find the owner!!! ❤
Please tell me how this ended.
Took me a sec to realize that was the guys finger..
The G.O.A.T with a goat
You're friends with Tyrese?
His friends thumb!!!
Pretty sure that's Satan.

Dudes got some hairy ass nuts, the goat too
I thought that thumb was a penis for a second.
That looks like a penis.
I thought his thumb was it’s penis 🙃
[removed]
This is one of the fluffiest goats I've seen. She is beautiful
The goat followed you home amdnis apparently smiling.  You are now the proud owner of a goat
OP, help your friend find this little fella a loving home. It's a bleak end to a short life for little male goats otherwise. Get him neutered before he starts absolutely reeking and never feed him alfalfa hay/pellets or livestock grain. Treat him well and he'll be friend to everyone he meets unless they give him enough of a reason not to be.
Has anyone else mentioned how lovingly he has cupped that goat’s balls? A real gent.
Did anyone else see the goat had a black PP at first
She looks soooooo HAPPY !!!!!!!!!
Thought the goat had a black dick
[removed]
Why he holding it like that lmao
[removed]
Don't hold him like that
[removed]
I can’t believe nobody has complimented his belly button yet! (The goats, not the friend- although I’d be up to complimenting his, too)
That’s nuts
Bawls
Really grabbing life by the balls
he has perfect teeth wtf
So how you gonna cook?
Damn thats some Fast Food Delivery
I love this picture so much
A follow up to this post: https://i.imgur.com/PZUFdxh.jpeg

Hii[hii](wew.google.com)
omg. he looks so hot 🤤 I love black guys
Does this dude have dentures his teeth look fake af
Billygoats smell to high heaven, yet your friend is smiling. Has he, by chance, taken a covid test recently?
I hope the poor goat is not going to be a New Year meal...
Anyone else see what i thought i saw :/ 8===D
“Your honor This photo is self-evident as to the relationship between the accused and it’s goat…”
Thought that was his member
Dont bring your indian mom here
Awww there both smiling!!!!! So cute. Where does the goat belong?
AAAAAwsome!
That goat looks so happy
He's beautiful
That was the one I bought him
And then your friend accidentally nuggled that goats balls… 😳
Happy goat :)
They are both smiling! Your friend’s smile lights up the whole picture. Bless him
Might be his kid.
Regardless of ownership. Holy cow is that goat adorable. It needs hugs.
You are one lucky man!

Poor Mary.

That dude has perfect teeth
Do you guys see it?
That goat is smiling.

He looks so happy, and that ghost looks so chill in his arms. It's like they were meant to be together.
The goat has a beer gut lol
The absolute goat
They are both smiling!!!
I hope this blossoms into a wonderful friendship
u/Fuzzie8 what’s the rest of the story? Did you find out who the goat belonged to??
grab em by the balls
I've never seen fluffier balls in my life.
Who has the bigger smile?
I am reading this from the goat’s perspective.
u/Fuzzie8 had a little lamb

little lamb
https://youtube.com/shorts/IVwnAyw6m0Y?

What a cute goat!

That goat wanted to fuck your friend.

What top is your friend wearing? I want one!

Goats like “I did that :)”
Sir I didn’t steal your goat. It followed me home…. In my arms
Awww
That's a carnival prize
Man I'm too tired for this. Thought it was super cute and then i noticed that dumb smirk on the goat(the animal, not the other g.o.a.t)
Finders keepers. S./

But seriously that goat probably does already have a home somewhere else.
Don't you love when dinner follows you home?
The comments got me crying 🤣🤣🤣
They are both so happy!
look at her smiling  what beatifule ears...
the goat enjoying his balls being touched, see he is smilling in the pic. 🤣
The goat told the cows to MOOOOoooove over! I’ll see my way out.
What great smiles!
So...you're friend decided to molest it?

Was this at the heavy petting zoo by any chance?
why this man holding this goat by the balls
Thats the devil and he seems chill lol
What country is this??
IS THAT A FUCKING GOAT BELLY BUTTON
Thought this was the confusing perspective sub for a minute, that strategically placed thumb

![gif](giphy|VUsAO76fbKiXe|downsized)
Haha your friend and his friend are adorable!
Three words: Free. Fucking. Goat.
Damn. Those are some nice teeth.
You’re going to have your hands full now, dude!
r/confusing_perspective
Someone arrest that goat, it’s by far and large criminally too cute.
Too cute
The smiles...😊
lucky!!!
In Russia dinner comes to you!
Hi
That isn’t a goat… that is a person
Aww look at their smiles! That is definitely someone’s pet goat.

His right hand.
Has a pretty good sac. I am a little jealous
Both are smiling , made my day ! Thanks !
Best part is that they’re both smiling.
https://youtu.be/xrTUmYxnNlo?t=281
In my wife's village a taking a found goat home would get you stoned infront of everyone.
Doubt it followed him home...he got that glimmer in his eye....
Time for some mutton biryani my friend
I am not comfortable with the way he is holding that goat.
Dude's thumb looks like it's the goat's dick lol
goat fucker lol
Goat recognize GOAT
Did we just become best friends?
“You’re mine now.” - The Goat
woah.
i don't know who's happier!
They both look happy!
So, have to ask: did he carry this goat who "followed" him?

And do I really want to know why the goat's smiling?
What is the goat working as?
I ain’t an expert but there’s gotta be a better way to hold it
Baaa baa baa whose billy goat is this?
Aww they both look so happy
Thats one big finger
You have perfect teeth my man. Wonderful smile and a cute friend to boot.
Mheeeeeh
Uhhhh that guy has beautiful teeth.
He’s happy with the holding position.
Friends for life!
I would like an oil painting of these 2 with a golden backdrop
Watch your finger bro. That’s making me a little bit uncomfortable
Aaaaaaaawh
Nah, that's just his kid
Why is your friend holding Ronaldo
Took way too long to realize that’s just a finger. I had sooo many questions?
Adorable!!!
OMG ITS MESSI
Awe whos a cute boi
How is he so fluffy . I’d keep that cute bastard
bring it bbaaaaack
Can I ask where you guys live?
They both look equally chuffed.
So is it MJ or Bron?
Your friend is so happy!
Them balls tho
I guess you own a goat now
Hands off his nuts bro
Take out
Congrats on the new goat, OP! He looks like a sweetie!
He just stole a goat.
That is the look of pure joy. 

Goats holding goats
That is a traditional boer buckling! Seems old enough to "extend" himself, so he might get stinky soon. Boers are a large breed of goat.

Since he can handle him, he's clearly worked with by people regularly, so hopefully the owners are looking for him.
And just like that you have a kid! Congrats
Aww look at hims little belly button
When food follows you
That guy has the straightest teeth I've ever seen
Living the dream
Both look very happy!!
[deleted]
That’s 2 awesome smiles to end the year on there!
You've got yourself a dinner bro. Happy new year.
He knows how to hold a kid.
[there's a fucking goat outside!](https://youtu.be/JLLFeZGeXbA)
They are so happy
“I’d like to report a KIDnapping”
Pretty goat.
Hey goat, go out for a pass!
Love the goat’s smiley face
Goats are so derpy, it’s great.
Such a chonky goat!
Adorable
OP is suspiciously silent.
Aww they look so happy together! Did he keep it?
I think this is like cats - when one follows you home, it’s yours. I don’t make the rules. 🤷🏻‍♀️😂
Goats recognize other goats that’s fs
This is why kids shouldn't talk to strangers. Goat talks to stranger. Goat is now in a picture where stranger is giving him a reach-around. Blink twice if you're in danger, goat!
Id be happy if Eminem followed me home too
Well it’s his KID now haha
Goat seems pleased
When I was younger and visiting Bangladesh, I slapped a goat’s ass for shits and giggles, and when I looked at my hand, there was anus juice. I was disgusted. 

The goat was the last one bleating.
It hurts to see someone else living your dream
That looks like a dorper lamb. Not a goat.
What a great pic. Looks like he's smiling for the pic too.
there was a lady on one of my routes who had a couple of goats. 

i've seen her taking them for a walk through the neighbor hood on a leash, it always made my day to see them out. 

i was able to snag a photo of them on top of their trampoline, i really wish i had backed up my photos on that phone before it fried :c
Damn your friend is fine! That smile is the G.O.A.T plus that goat looks like a giant beanie baby! Now I want a giant goat beanie baby!
The Goat face look like an ancient Spartan.
I ain’t afraid of no goats
Can we just enjoy the picture without talking about goat balls?!
The goat smile is me after a couple drinks and a few hits off the bong.
Why doesn’t that happen to *me?*
That goat looks so happy
THICC
Smiles and goat belly 10/10
I thought that was the goat's dick at first but then I saw it was just the guys' finger lol
They look like they have been best friends for years
I don't even care if that's not the real story.  That's one of the best pictures I've seen in a while.  Truly made me laugh.
Wow nice
about to get NSFW really soon if he’s Arab
Free Goat!
They both look so happy!
This adorable thing looks like someone's pet, I'm sure he escaped from a backyard somewhere and his owner is quite concerned.
Belly. BELLYYYYYY
Ahhh such cute goat
They both look so happy!
Goat looks so chill lol
Omg they both look so happy) this made my day😊
Awesome. Access to free cheese.
Edit: looked at the pic a little closer, and there's not going to be any milk from this dude.
Why does the white goat have a black penis
Ghosts have black penis
Dwawww the goat looks so pleased with himself

Your friend has the longest thumb I’ve ever seen
[hii](ashdgeve/)
Cutest thing I’ve seen today
Homie for life
It looks like he's holding a chubby child in a goat costume .
r/wholesome
Oh that’s his finger
Looks like a chubby little person in a goat suit.
I thought his finger was it’s dick

That is somebody's goat.
And so it came to pass that Jeff and Earl “The Goat” Manigoat shared adventures, solved mysteries, and helped the downtrodden all over this great land.
Goats got a nice smile too...
Just goes to show it thinks your friend is a real GOAT!
Not good NIGERIANS eat goat!!

Nice, free curry!
Bruh what the hell is a goat I love it
The stripe in the face and belly button though

Wow his balls are just right on his hand lol
Does no one see that this man is grabbing the goats nuts
Congratulations goat dad!
Split second,oh,it’s a thumb
Wait until your wife finds out you brought home a kid
Lol!!! Best day ever :)
I lived in ATL for a bit. A neighbor the street over had a goat and I regularly had to catch the goat and take it back to them because he was an escape artist apparently. Or maybe their gate wasn’t great. Walking a goat is fucking hard.
He looks super happy
So fluffy!!
[deleted]
Both of them are happy about it, friends for life
You both have lovely smiles!
Such a dope picture
Mr.Goat looks happy about that hand placement 😂
You've been chosen. By the happiest goat on the internet.
What kind of goat is that? All goats in our country looks food grade.
Your smiles are equally different and equally precious.
They both look so happy
Your friend has a beautiful smile! They are both so cute!
Quick someone photoshop it as one of those floating Renaissance babies
That is one ridiculously adorable goat. Like if he was wild and looking for a home I'd be like "you're a goat, I can't have a goat, that's not possible". Then I'd look at that goofy face and be like "fuck, I have a goat".
Curry time!!
I think he’s making that face because of where you’re grabbing him, man. Lol, I think that’s a pained smile.
A fat goat
Can’t blame it to be honest
Bro I thought ur friend was sheck Wes for a second
They look made for eachother
Ok I thought the goat was excited at first…
Goat is proud af
Both are very cute!
I thought that finger was a goat dick for a second
He has him by the balls!
Cannot decide which is cuter?!?  The guy or the goat 😊😊😊 love this

Little does he know, he is dinner lol

The smile!!! So cute:)
He’s grinning he got what he wanted when u gave him attention
That goat looks like a stuffed animal, it's too cute and looks happy! 

All the goats I've met have been little jerks.
Yo put Tom Brady down.
Well! Isn't that a pleasant change in a day! And with a happy fluffy goat - I'm  jealous!🥰
The thumb looked like a dick
Your friends smile is the goat. That’s a winner.
Cute goat, shitty click bait title.
Thank you
Why you got a finger up it's ass
That goat is very well groomed! Look at his little legs and hooves! IDK…reminds me of my Yorkie after a fresh shampoo and cut l!
If he’s the goat, you must be something 👏
bro is that your fucking thumb
Why’s your finger on its genitals?
And a wrist full of goat nutz
A little boer buck. <3 Little smiley screamy friend.
Smiling goat
At first I thought his finger was a goat dick

I’m vocalizing this to no one right now, this is crazy what a handsome boy!

Look at his tummy and face!

Is that his finger?
What a pleased and happy goat. Cheers.
Yeah. SURE he did.

Love goat

If your friend doesn’t work in a goat farm, this is hella sus
