"So I noticed you haven't been filling the bird feeders lately. You ok?"
Chickadees are such curious and friendly little birds. I had one a couple of years ago that liked to sit on my sun hat when I was tending my flowers.
A bird just attempted to carjack you
It’s been trying to contact you about your vehicle’s extended warranty.
How TF did it stay on your key long enough to take a pic!?  That bird ain’t right.
"For the last time, I'm doing the driving."
You're a Chickadee magnet
Is this your bird? Or is it wild?
Step 1: befriend bird

Step 2: make a dress

Step 3: become princess
It’s a car birdgler
How many cars do you unlock with this keychain?
I grew up in Maine. I can hear their song just by looking at the bird. 

When I was in 8th grade we had a bird feeder man (basically a scarecrow sitting in the woods at school with bird seed on a tray. Dressed in a yellow rain jacket). 

We would remove the scarecrow, put on a separate yellow jacket and sit still to watch the birds land on the tray and eat. 

One of my best memories
And thus a new disney princess is born.
You’re on the same nail appointment schedule as me. #twins
Nice try, Nissan PR department.
Looks like the bird found something shiny?
Black cap chickadee!
You clearly had an excellent day
Nice nails. Love the color.
You have a new friend!
He wants to go zoom zoom
It's saying don't go to work, I'll lead you to your one true love.
You've heard of elf on a shelf, get ready for...
Accidental Disney princess?
this looks like it could be an album cover for some reason. also love your nails
Nice keychain
He grip
"Sooooo, are we gonna talk about them nails?"
Those acrylics are a metaphor for my mental state
Yer a Disney Princess ‘Arry
Miss, why are you trying to steal that poor birds car?
The fact that your manicure has grown out that much and looks perfectly unchipped and still new is the real shocker here!!! Like how?!? 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻💖💖
r/BirdsArentReal
That’s a chickadee for you, super tame and curious. Last time I filled the bird feeder one landed  on it eager for food as I was hanging it back up. Such adorable sweet little birds :)
Bro go see your nail tech!
Benicio Bird Toro
For some reason this took me way too long to figure out what it was. May be time for bed.
You’re a princess now Harriet.
Fun/Sad fact: Black Capped Chickadees only live 1.5 years
You clearly had an excellent day
Put out a bird feeder immediately
Thinks it's a tur-key
One flew in my car while I was on break today, I wish it hadn't startled me so bad, I shooed it out...
Reminds me of the time I accidently became the alpha male for a flock of galahs. I had been putting out pre-shelled sunflower seeds for them for a while.  One day I noticed one of the males was keeping all the other galahs away from the feed.  I walked out and at an even pace, walked towards the offending male.  It flew a few feet away.  I turned and continued to walk towards it.  We repeated this ritual a few more times until it flew off to a tree some distance away.   A day or so later I was hand feeding the flock when I noticed that a female seemed to be keeping other females away from me.  I felt like such a big galah.
Perhaps they are your guardian angel that delayed you that extra few moments to avoid a final destination tragedy.
Adorable, but also if u see this, your nail colour is fucking beautiful
Careful, it tryna steal your ride
I love your nails! Beautiful colour
and not only did it happen, but you managed to get a picture of it. Wild.
I’m not one for religion or anything like that, but I think the universe just saved you from a car accident by a few seconds.
You are now officially a disney princess congratulations. Go and use your powers for good.
That's a Chickadee! They eat up all my bird seed.
"Disney princess application accepted. I am your first applicant for the position."
Haha, are you Cinderella or snow white ? :')
I know there’s a bird hanging off her key, but look how much her nails have grown out!
You tried to start a bird? You monster. 😁
What kind of manicure did you get? They look flawless after what looks like 2+ weeks. I do mine own and they are 75% gone after just one week lol
This is obviously FAKE.

You can see her real nails growing underneath the green stick-ons.
He’s almost holding on as hard as those acrylics
So cute!
Thought this was an upside down disembodied cat paw attached to the keys somehow x-x
Bird Up! *bow bing pow!*
Why doesn't this happen to me
Carjacking gone wild.
Wow, the bird, your nails, and your keys match haha. And if this was a wild bird, then your nails are always on point!
Disney scene in real life:  one of the animals has to distract Cinderella from going back to her room until the other animals have finished sewing her a new dress
"Suh dud" said the birb.
I'd like to talk to you about extending your warranty
3 weeks manicure?
Damn, you got a nissan?
How do you still have those nails on?  That's an amazing glue
If you’d quit dropping your keys in food juices 🥵
Those car thieves are getting pretty clever (and cute) these days...

Is that a Suzuki Swift you have there ?
That’s so unlikely!
Something something disney princess

It's a chicka-kee.

A bird gave you a set of keys?
Its enemy stand attack
Lmao my tired ass thought it was a spoon
Yo! I think your car might be a Disney princess or something!
But... Why are the finger nails half way up the fingernails
Do you have a minute to talk about our Lord and saviour Jesus Christ?
those nails, it’s time
I’m so jealous of you Snow White motherfuckers.
Why would you glue a taxidermy chickadee to your key?
Territory marking 101


1. Poop on the car.

2. Grab the car keys.
How does someone have the time to get their phone out and take such a high quality photo before it flies off?
The bird is cool and all. 
But I really love the nails!
"Take me to your car, so I may poop on it."
Awh cute x
So you tried to steal the keys from a bird? 
Pathetic.
Why did I initially think the bird is sitting on a table and you're caressing its back with the key?
I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.
When I got home I found it was NAILED to the perch!

That's a Norwegian Blue!

Beautiful plumage !
GTA birdstyle
By bird law, it now owns your house
Awww I really want a birb frand!! It so cute. 😭🐦💕
Oh wow, how awesome! The chickadee is my favorite woodland bird, even did my 6th grade book report and speech on it! 😅
Black capped chickadee! How pretty
Took my brain a while to understand what was happening. It kept insisting that the key was in the foreground with a dog in the background.
You are now a Disney Princess.  Listen, I know it’s a lot of responsibility but I don’t make the rules.
THIS is a message. Walk.
*If you have a push start system on your car, you’ll never know this feeling*
This is like if Snow White had a remote starter
Expect a Cease and Desist letter from Disney corporate any day now.
Nails lookin fab tho
Congratulations, you are now a Disney(tm) princess, please proceed to processing for your frumpy dress.
Nothing in the world would make me happier than this happening to me
Your new title is Snow White.
I feel the urge to give you money to get your nails done I see my wtb nails that bad and just pay for more lol
That just means you’re a Disney Princess
I'm pretty sure that means youre a disney princess now
I really did not think my nails would be so interesting. For those of you concerned, they are gel nails that I got done 4 weeks ago. I got them filled shortly after I took the pic so they are no longer grown out like that LOL
New Disney princess
Bruh moments
HE ADOPTED YOU
"Where ya goin?"
Also perfect for r/animalsbeingderps.
"I got her keys! Get her purse!"
Black capped chickadee. Massachusetts state bird and an adorable bird
"Wyd tonite bby"? 🐦🐦
You're a disney princess now, just gotta accept it.
"You might be wondering how I got here."
When the birds try to stop you from driving you KNOW you're wasted.
How you doin?
The birb has chosen you
Well in case you were wondering, it turns out Disney princesses drive nissans
A chickadee tried to car jack you!??? What is the world coming to?
Fun fact, Magpies are well known for stealing shiny things in Germany, we also have a saying here "thievish like a magpie".
Youre a disney princess!
You drive my toilet

My only toilet

When I feel crappy

I stain your paint

You'll never know, dear

How much I poo there

Please don't take

My toilet away
As god is my witness, I didn’t think that Nissans could be Disney princesses.

Disney princess problems
Congratulations! You are a Disney princess now!
Chickadees are hands down the bravest birds in my yard.
Chickadees are amazingly brazen.
"This is a robbery. Your car keys are mine now."
Does your car remote beep, or chirp?
Congrats you’re now a Disney Princess
You might be a Disney Princess now
Okay fucking Snow White.

Did you key-p the bird?
Congratulations! You are now a Disney princess.
You’re a Disney Princess!
The drones programming is getting more aggressive. Someone should notify r/BirdsArentReal so they can get their top people on this immediately.
The bird was admiring your nails.
How have your nails grown but your polish is intact?
Do your nails
It's trying to eat your lunula behind those fake nails.
You got a great manicure and then gained Disney princess powers?!
You are now a princess.
Now is the time to break out in a song.. tra la la la
Look at this disney princess over here.
Congratulations you're a Disney Princess.
I think this means you are a Disney princess
Congratulations. You are a disney princess now!
Beautiful hand
Might be someone you knew born again as a bird
“We have been trying to contact you about your cars extend warranty”
I love your nails, by the way! Maybe the bird wanted to come closer and appreciate them too. :)
Birds aren’t real
You're a disney princess!
Chicks are crazy about Nissans
Snow White? Is that you?
“we’ve been trying to reach you about your car’s extended warranty”￼￼
Woah nice nail polish.
How cute.

&#x200B;

ps. love your nails ♥
All of the birds died in 1986 due to Reagan killing them and replacing them with spies that are now watching us. The birds work for the bourgeoisie.
Why isn't your glued on nails covering all of your real nails?
Those nails makes me sad and eww :(
[deleted]
Fake nails look so tacky
Its a sign.
You are a Disney princess now
Congrats you have levelled up to disney princess status.
I think you’re a Disney princess now.
Are you Snow White?
Are you some kind of a Disney princess
It's official you're a Disney princess
Disney Princess Confirmed
Gotta admit, I see press on nails and I automatically subtract 50 IQ points.
Bout time for a manicure ain’t it? 💅🏼
Preventing you from leaving too early. You got yourself a guardian Angel or whatever it’s called when you’re agnostic/ verge of being an atheist like me lol. You’ve got someone beautiful ghost lookin out for you.
You should get it a coupe
This is a robbery!
Hi, where are we going?
Snow white?
When you're the first one in your friend group to get a car and they're always trying to hitch rides
Crapping on the car is one thing but now this!

The gull.
Holy shit. The chickadees near me are so skittish, this is beyond impressive.
Chikadees are brave as fuck. they'd sit on my shoulder while I filled the bird feeder.
This is how side quests start.
bird: this roost seems cheep, but hello friend!
Your car must be an Austin Princess.

Wait, it's a Nissan.  Maybe a Fairlady is close enough?
Cool! They brought you a car. Next Level Disney Princess
I would fucking die
You may now expect your letter from Walt Disney’s Magical School for Princesses sometime soon.
*edit: typo
Cinderella???
What a show off

Edit: the bird
Chicka dee dee dee dee dee
I probably should go inside to pee, then.
don't drink and drive bro
Thanks for the car pally
It wanted a closer look
That’s crazyyyy
Funnily enough one of these flew into my house today and we spent a while getting it out
"Quick, I'm commandeering your vehicle. No time to explain!"

That’s not your car... why are you trying to open it with your car keys??
Car keys are huge.
I'm only familiar with the Nissan Bluebird, this must be a new model.
I'm thinking you should be called Snow White now!
What bait were you using?
GIMME DA KEYS!
Looks like somebody tryna steal your car.
Aren't you lucky?
You’re gonna drive a single car. right?
Lemme guess, Australia?
No fair, I wanna be Cinderella.
Wow 🤩
I thought it was a portlandia skit...”put a bird on it”

Makes everything better lol

Friends don't let friends drive
Always remember to lock your bird
How did you manage to get a picture, I can't even get a good picture of my dog without him moving around
Lady Sanders!?
Ya got some.... SEEDS??
Air magic! You have it!  embrace your gift
I LOVE chickadees!!  I live in Rhode Island and I have  2 bird feeders in my yard and they always wait next to me as i fill them!
One day you will have a fist full of perchless keys and no birds to take pictures of
Keys to my heart!!!
Just be careful using that extension cord that's laying out on the floor. That's a fire hazard
That is so cute!
Have to start expecting princess type of thing with the keys to a ford, nissan, and a honda.
How hard was it to take the picture?
That is amazing.
This must be a key event in your life!

(... I'll get me coat)
You are the chosen one
How still where you?
SIDEQUEST TIME
The new DUI testing system has taken flight.
That's your guardian angel and is telling you not to drive today.
Bird friend!!
Attempted carjacking!
Yoooo wtf I had this dream last night
I just woke up and thought this was a rabbit's foot
Ask it to clean up your house with its friends...sew a dress?
"Let me Drive! Chirp."
Free bird
Chosen one
I need your clothes, keys and a Nissan!
That's so keyute
What if this is you from the future? And to avoid spatial paradoxes and space-time rifts, you could only appear in the form of a bird. You came back to warn yourself that if you got into the vehicle, you would be challenged to a drag race by Needles and collide with a Rolls Royce. The accident and ensuing injuries would set in motion a series of events that would destroy you financially and hamper your ability to play the guitar. This little lady just saved your future. 

Thank you sweet bird. Thank you future me.
Holy heck that is cute
"Nooo....... you stay."
Pretty bird pretty bird
I wonder if it liked the color of your fingernails
Off topic but your nail colour is cool!
What are the odds
Give back my car keys, you giant human.
You found your car keys!
He looks as surprised by it as you do.
Aww, I love chickadees! Probably the most common bird I see at the feeder at my house.
The bird saw how many cars you owned and wanted to be adopted
You’re obviously too drunk to drive, let bird drive you home.
Did you report the villain that painted your nails black?
I imagine this in r/photoshopbattles
"Your too drubk to dribe"
Good new you are a Disney princess.
Bad news your parent are probably dead according to the Disney standard.
Bird Flu is back. Look it up.
Lovely :)

To make it start, turn smoothly the key !
Whats up with your fake finger nails all about to fall off?
You are a Disney princess! :D
Swiggidy swoogity your keys are now my property
Hi, I’m sorry to inform you, but your birb warranty has expired. Do you have a moment to renew?
Clearly you must be a long lost magic princess
This is a sign. You will not win the next Dem presidential primary
Birb on your keys?
That’s not a bird that is clearly a cat.
So you've found a human hand with keys!
And then he whispered “no one will ever believe you”
How just how 🤯.
Little birdies pick up line was “You got the key to my heart”
GIVE ME THE SHINY!!!
You should t have gone out as the Disney princess from Brave.
Either you're a Disney princess or he wants the keys for a joyride
For a second I thought a dog chewed your keys and it was laying in the background. Then I noticed the drone
Oh wow birdie's doing the front lever!
So you car key is a Disney princes now. I smell profit for a new movie
So you are hanging with a key?
Omg I would die happy.
You can expect a call from Disney lawyers for infringing on the copyright the stole
Hi- this is Jessica with information on your vehicles extended warranty..
A bird on the key is worth two in the car - or whatever they say.
^birb
How did you take the picture? Trying to figure out the angle and all.
'This keys are mine now, leave it pls'
sanctity commences
They belong to him now
‘Let’s ride!’
"Do not leave. You are going to die."

This bird is the key to our hearts
Poggers
You have been chosen.
Your nails though... time to get a fill.
You’re now a motorised Disney princess.

A bird gave you keys to a new car?!

Damn that's awesome.
Chickadee-y the chickadee
You have been blessed by the gods xp
Car-jacking ya, right?  Stupid birds.  Thanks, Obama.
I’d like to think someone from above was saying hello and trying to keep you from driving for a minute longer.
Snow White can drive??
Sweet
Omg love
Chickadee key service, how can I help you?
Chicka-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. Chicka-dee.

You got a new car? Congratulations!

Oh yeah, nice bird btw
"Omae wa mou shindeiru, ni-san"
Imagine taking up your phone to take a picture, then it flies away before you have the time to capture it.
She IS a princess!
Watch out, next some mice are gonna help you make a dress! (I’m saying watch out cause I’m sure you don’t want to step on them or get in their way.)
I hear you have a Nissan Tweetee R. 

Sorry.
Are you from Disney? What's your tragic backstory?
Chickadee-dee-key
"Hello, I am from the church of Horus Christ of latter day birds.  You might have heard of us as the Mourners.  before you get in your car we would love to tell you about Horus and how he actually visited  the ancient Americas after his resurrection."
It's a sign .... W sign?  Unlock the birds 🖕🖕🖕🖕 I'm w it
I would take that as a sign not to drive
Those are keys. It’s a bird. Birds fly. It’s very clear what it’s trying to communicate here. 

It wants to sell you a flying car. How can you not see this? Smh.
What kind of bird is that ?
Birds like so uh I haven’t been seeing any beard seeds lately what’s up with that
Thank God for the 1400 check .... that was a nice little snack for a hungry MF
You’ve lost your driving privileges
move over, bird is driving.
“Do you have a sparrow minute to talk about our bird and savior Geesus Christ?”
Wow that’s at least like a 1/Million odds
Ew, those things are filthy and probably carry disease. Who know’s where keys have been?!
I'm always amazed by people who get photos like this. Not that the thing happened at all, although that is pretty special but that it stayed happening long enough for you to grab your phone and actually take the picture!
How you doin'?
I guess I'm am old man by reddit standards. I'm 30.

Go bird watching. It's calming. Meditative. All that stuff that lowers your blood pressure. I live in a harbor town in the Puget Sound, and I usually see a few herons on my walks.
why do u have keys to 3 different cars on one keychain though
I see a x-trail lover 👍
You just happen to have perfect nails on as well. Very nice 😂
"wait this isn't my car"
Birds carjacking, I am out, 2021 is getting worse
Love the color of your nails
Congratulations: you have unlocked Disney princess mode.
Welp. Now I gotta buy a Nissan. Do they all come with Chickadees or can you pick your own bird?
"Hello there..."
Awe.
I'm jealous! I have gotten into bird watching after lockdown last year (I know, I'm a cliche), and I see these guys around all the time. But I can never get any birds nearly this close to me.
~~Jeep~~ Cheep
Oh, well that's neat
How?! I want to make a picture of my cats...  I can't unlock the phone with one hand, can't zoom in with one hand etc etc.

And other people just make awesome pictures of wild animals with one hand.
Give back the little dude’s care keys ya thief
Do glad you didn't buy a Ford Falcon!
Your keys are a Disney princess!
Too many twitter followers...
I thought that was an electric drill......
And here I am, filling a bird feeder that works pretty well but not able to see a single bird in it
Looks like you better get


walkin
Birb is like: "take me with you! :D"
One time a small bird like that consistently kept returning to my window, kept pecking at it and looking in. This bird would come by every day, and did this for *weeks*. I even installed a ghetto perch for it that it used many times. 

I thought there was something wrong with it. Like, where’s your sense of self-preservation? How do you survive behaving like that?
You biking today Disney princess
The bird chose you.
Us Nissan drivers do emit a tangible wave of good vibes.
Nissan drivers unite!
Too cute to handle!!! Awww
I guess you ain't driving today
So, how’s the life of a Disney princess?
Mf tried to steal the damn car
It delayed you for a couple of seconds to avoid a terrible car crash. :)
I thought that was a gun
Iam more interested in the key with the f button. :-)
Friendly reminder not to tweet and drive.
Peep peep
So umm ill be late for work
Someone trying to steal your car? Must be a tough neighborhood...
Ommggg, I accidentally zoomed in and saw its beaautiful innocent eyes :')))) my heart!
So seriously is this your pet finch if so what is his/her name. Also so cute.

“Hey sexy! What’chu up to?” /flex core strength
Oh no!  I hope the police catch him soon, and you get your car back.
Excuse me miss, I think you’re holding the key to my heart
You got a snack on the road.
So cute!

Unshelled peanuts or black oil sunflower seeds will have them feeding from the palm of your hand.

Some jays too.
Pure KAWAII
What the dog doing?
"Please, don't go"
"So, where we going?"
There was a Geico Gecko trying to sell you car insurance.

Looks like he should've bought life insurance instead.
You have been exemptes from the great bird purge.
It's wants to use your car key for its nest
I'm pretty sure you have a new active quest in your quest log  after this encounter.
Plot twist: she'd been feeding this bird for 20 years !
How many cars do you own?? 🤨

Nice one

Youre the chosen one.
It's trying to tell you to take a break. Or to stop clipping its environment. Could we have a tree hugging bird?

Are you now proclaimed to be a Disney princess?
You are a tree. This is your life now
Has Disney bought Nissan?
That is some one who loves you checking in from else where . You have a very bright light .
I've been thinking about picking up one of those black and yellow nissan birds. Does it start up and fly right away? How's it's air mileage?
Ado-fucking-rable
You're a princess now (:
Low key flexing on how many cars does this person owned.
Serious question- how is this species extant?  It’s a small bird with a penchant for getting up close to omnivorous species hundreds of times it’s size.
Black cap: Dibs on car. Mine naow.
Guess you're a Disney princess now 🤷🏻‍♂️
Make a wish!
Consider sending it to Nissan on social media.
Lucky!
