OP, sorry about all the salty, jealous people ITT. Locked for your protection and your baby's happiness.
I think your son might be jack jack
Dude you have to dress him up as jack jack for Halloween! 
If Robert Baratheon were kissed by fire. 
Idk bro, that baby doesn’t have your majestic thunder god like beard. Might still wanna do it. 
'I just poo'd!"

"ME TOO!!"
The dad looks like Ron Weasley halfway through morphing into Hagrid. 
This is actually just a well-photoshopped picture of OP after and before shaving.
It looks like you just gave birth to that baby...
I hope you do an identical picture every year, it would be a great thing for you, your son and Reddit to look back on!
What is it about a baby that can turn a scruffy, bearded, shirtless man adorable?
I'm like 90% sure you're both cartoons. Youre "Hagar the horrible" and that little guy is clearly jack jack. 
This is such a great pic 😆 enjoy your "mini me"
Baby Jack jack is real
You sure she had him? His dna test come back? Lol was a running joke with my wife for years 
GODS I WAS STRONG THEN !

Great pic, all the best to you !
I mean, was there any doubt?
Best looking Jack Jack costume 10/10
Easily the most precious thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit! You and the wife sure can make an adorable baby 😊
Congratulations, OP - and welcome to the world, OP's son. <3 That's one adorable picture!

From mum to new dad: Enjoy the heck out of the baby time, it runs faster than Usain Bolt on ecstasy... blink once and he has his first school day, blink twice and he's taller than you... 
Can't stop giggling at this pic, holy damn life flies fast. 
Fffffff, someone call Mr. Incredible! Syndrome took JackJAck again!
He looks like jack jack from the incredible!
I think you’re safe unless you have a long lost identical twin... you two look like you’re going to have a lot of fun. Enjoy!!
That baby looks like Jack Jack
I dunno man that baby is awwwwfully clean-shaven...
This was really a missed opportunity to glue a fake beard to that kid.
I love seeing dads and their kids. These two are ADORABLE ❤️❤️
but what about a maternity test?
I CANT JUST KEEP GIVING HIM COOKIES!!
Bear and cub.
That baby is adorable. You are going to have so much fun together.
The judge would take one look at the two of you and laugh you out of the courtroom.
Oh my god, he looks like Jack Jack! :D You look like Tormund too, OP. \^\^ Epic.
Unless your wife has a very specific type.
Yeah i think you’re good on that front. This is a hilarious photo lol
Congratulations and good luck!

I’m pretty sure when it’s a clone, paternity tests are just redundant

Thanks for the smile and the laugh!  What a great photo!

Congrats 
I don’t have a good photo but I have a similar situation with my baby and it’s awesome 
Super cute! Reminds me of when I took my son (when he was 2) to an indoor pool and he was sitting next to me when an very elderly woman stopped in front of us and asked if I was his father. I said yes and she gazed at us for a minute and said "Doesn't look a bit like you" and walked of. She was right but it was funny. You'llnever have 
This picture makes me feel pure joy. I’m glad for you man. 
Yiyu will recreate this photo every year OR be a horrible person. No middle ground. 
Maybe your wife just had a type

Red hair don't care!! Super cute baby!
That is fucking adorable. 
Adorbs
Holy shit that is a cute kid.
This picture is the manifestation of 'happy'. 
That is 100% a real life Jack Jack.

JACK JACK!

This is begging for a face swap.
Better safe than sorry
It just doesn't get any better than this!

Congratulations ! 

You both look incredibly happy and perfect for each other. 
I hope you always have this closeness as time goes by.

This made me so genuinely happy. Thanks OP! ❤️

Love the beard! Congratulations, dad!
Anyone ever tell you, you look like roland(one of the squires) from a knight's tale
How many hitpoints does your beard have? 
You look like my daughter and husband! When she was born the nursery didn’t even look at the wrist bands because of all that ginger. 
Ron Weasley, what happened? :(
What an adorable baby!!
I can’t even see your full face and I can tell he looks exactly like you. So much love in this one photo! 
This is very wholesome but your eyes seem like they're just wide open all white. It's a bit scary lol.
Omg this is the cutest!! 💖😚💖
it’s fucking Jack Jack!
is that Jack Jack
Was there a mother, or was this just a cell division   kind of thing?
Jack Jack!
This is so pure 

Also it looks like you're the one who gave birth somehow

That is one *adorable* baby! Congratulations bro!
[removed]
My partner is a ginger and I am blonde, when my son was about to enter the world the nurse said "I can see hair!" I immediately asked if it's red. He's a little Blondie like me, maybe next time.
My husband is a ginger while I have auburn. He hears this quite often. Very cute, btw. 
Ahhhh. Adorable. Cheers! 
that baby looks like my social studies teacher. same hair cut too
So there was some concern then?
That little tuft of red hair should've been the first hint lol
Definitely not my dude. Late congrats to you my friend! 
What a great picture!!!
Beautiful kid!
What a cute baby!! Yep those red-haired genes are strong 
Beautiful 
Nah. You good.
You look like you're both about to pull out top hats and canes and break into a song and dance.

CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING A DAD :D
Awww he reminds me of my cat.
Love this! 

Fellow redhead here. Both of my kids shed their red around a year old and grew blonde to replace it. 
You remind me of gritty the flyers mascot
One day when i grow up i wanna be that baby
You kinda look like Cal from orange is the new black 
And in this case with this little baby.... You are not! The father!

(Crowd goes wild)
That’s so cute !
Awesome!  


My little girl is supposed to turn 7 tomorrow, but I am trying a spell I found online to make her a cute lil pup again.  Miss those days. 


Thanks for sharing
You look exactly like my English teacher. 🤨
Omg so cute!!!
I think that’s the paternity test.
the new god of war but better in every way
I'm concerned that it's a question whether you did or not...
Hermione would be proud! 
That is so cute!
This needs a face swap!
The seed is strong.
Maury Povich will set this shit straight. Get him on the phone stat.
You are hilarious on Broad City.
Baby and the Beast
R/Gritty
Can never be too careful... 
If he starts shooting laser beams out of his eyes you know who to call.
I dunno man I think we need to see your kids beard first. Should only take 3 days or so by the looks of yours.
He looks good for right after having given birth
That's an awesome pic!! 😆😆
Or maybe your wife has a type....
If you shaved you could be twins
You know, 9 times out of 10 i don't want anything to do with kids...but every once and a while one of you assholes post a wondeful pic of one of your adorable little fuckers and i reconsider...
That is a damn cute baby! 
That's a great pic, he's adorable! Congrats dad! :) 
Your son is in real life Jack-jack from incredibles! So cute!

Your son looks at you the way my son looks at me, unfortunately I don’t look at my son the way you look at yours, it kills me
How adorable is that??!!??
Do you have a brother? 
NO ONE HAS EVER BEAT ME IN THE GAME OF DRINK!
Your hubby looks like Robert Baratheon! 🙂

I’d get one anyway. 
That baby looks like a real life cabbage patch kid! 
Gritty?

Wow, Rupert Grint has put on some weight. 
Jack Jack?
OMG your kid is Jack-Jack from The Incredibles. I'm pretty sure that makes you Mr. Incredible. 
That is too cute
Sort by controversial if you want to lose a little bit of hope for humanity. 
This picture made me smile! 

Remember: no firing the baby around the house. :-)
The results are back. Yep, it's true: You're Mark Addy's son.
This is too cute
Beautiful! I want a mini ME. 
D’awwwwwww!!!!
Hmm Beards don’t match though. /s
You cannot convince me that is not Jack Jack. 
Really cute pic!

Shave your head bruv.. as a fellow balder, its tough, but youre big with a beard so it should go smoothly
Adorable!!!
No but you may need a shirt
You remind me of Jack Black, and your son is literally Jack Jack. Hmmmmm.
This. Is. Adorable.
[removed]
This just me smile...
Can you take a paternity test without a soul?
Great pic, thanks for giving me a  giant smile. Beautiful son you have... really adorable baby! If I was offered the chance to go back in time, I would hands down choose to spend another day with any of my children when they were babies again
How can you really know unless you put a fake beard on the baby? 
Proud Dad, happy baby. Such a wonderful happy picture of one of the most basic, but also most amazing, miracles and blessings of life. 

Congrats on your kid, be sure to save this image to post it during his graduation, and wedding..and etc. 
Man cersi must be mad at you 
r/babiesmirin 
I had to look up Jack Jack but wow. .  that's uncanny!
Just like me and my dad.. who i look exactly like, and I look nothing like my mom.

For 30 years now he's been making the same dad joke.. "I accuse her of not being the mother"
But no beard... Better reconsider on that paternity test
Your sperm kicked the egg out then just grew into a baby.  
most people don't?
Congrats on your child, Gritty! 
You look like a red headed Robert Baratheon.
M’baby
He looks just like Jack Jack .. so does that mean.. 

Mr Incredible 😳😳😳
Adorable! Also adorable is that the baby looks like Jack Jack from The Incredibles lol
Best G.D. picture on the interwebs. 
You were great in Game of Thrones.
Kid looks exactly like Jack Jack from the Incredibles
But if you did, who could blame her. 😛 Okay that’s my mean joke of the week. NO MORE.
I know it’s the top comment but I want to say it anyways, that kid looks like the baby from The Incredibles
Yikes. 
Thank you for sharing! This makes me SO EXCITED to meet the baby that I am brewing. He already looked like my husband on the 3D ultrasound - I can't wait to see them become best buds!
I think you provided the sperm and the egg for that baby! 
Too fucking cute dude.  
Hey no breast feeding allowed on reddit I'm just sitting here at Chili's and had no trigger warning or anything :,(
How do you only have 19k karma?!? This post has 80k and you and your baby deserve more!!!

Jack Jack and a Ron and Hagrid hybrid.
Some gross sex was had
Isn't this a subreddit for cute animals? Not hairy shirtless redheads and their human-spawn.
The father mr. Incredible bro sorry to drop the news lol
Is this a crossover? We've got Mr Flintstone and JackJack!
:D
nope sorry syndrome you're not getting away with claiming jack jack  is your kid any time soon.

Why were you even considering a paternity test? Was someone else fucking your wife?
bro, you need to start taking better care of yourself

You say that, but the poor little guy may want one anyway
Maybe a shirt

You've clearly  kidnapped Mr. Incredible's youngest son and I suggest you return him before something bad happens.

This is so fucking adorable I literally just started spontaneously crying crom the futeness overload.

See, you even made me Spoonerism in my bloody typing! >.<
Cuteeeeee
i lack the proper adjective to describe the impressiveness of that beard
She’s obviously saying she’s slept around but thinks she knows who the father is
He’s gonna need a super suit soon. 
The title makes it seem as if you slept with other men. Unless you're the guy then congrats man! 
This is the future Carrot Top we're looking at
The title implies you have multiple sex partners
Why aren’t you wearing a shirt?
Jack jack?
Why would you regardless of what the kid looked like unless you were fucking other guys hmmm 
Lol at this betabux soyboy. Poor little guy, he's doomed.
sorry but can i ask why would you need the test?. is infedility an issue with every couple not having the same face as their children? cant it be normal that your child looks different than you?
Maybe you should.  I guess you weren’t aware, but you have to have sex to make one of those.  
At least one villager is happy about it
Thats ok, if you were in France it'd be illegal anyway
Soyboy
Baby's 1st soy face
Be sure to spend as much time with him before you die of a heart attack or stroke at 55. 
The only thing you need is a BMI test.
He looks like a fat Ron Weasley 
u should still get one
Ron Weasley let himself go...
Robert baratheon? 
Removed
I love you but get one. I'm sorry I just dealt with this "doppleganger" child thing last year and it fucked my life up. She was sleeping with a guy that looked like me so ridiculously that her child ended up looking like me. Of your statement was rhetorical like you already know, more happiness to you. If not, just get it done.
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwe
r/naturalmrincrediblecosplay

&#x200B;

But for real though, this is the cutest thing I've ever seen. All you need now is a mask and a cookie!!
A🧐🧐
But still everyone should get one.
That kid from Harry Potter really let himself go 
Are you calling your wife/girlfriend a cheater ?
What kind of dog is he? 
Are you calling your wife/girlfriend a cheater ?
You need a shave 😲
".... Because my wife is chained in my basement" 
My parents encouraged me to get a paternity test (and I did) but it confirmed what the tell-tale crinkled helices and mild clinodactyly already suggested.
backstory for this image, OP edited out a big ol' fedora from this image and the baby is laughing at it because he is a little chad
Parents are just kids having kids 
Ya but is it the real mother?
Yea, but you are still ginger :(
It can't hurt
agreed, honestly these days i think more people should get paternity tests.. with everyone having cell phones its WAY EASIER to connect and cheat than it was in the old days when you would have to find a payphone or landline and call there landline and possibly talk to the husband when you are looking for his wife to come hangout... nowadays egveryones connected to social media and others 24/7 it makes cheating very easy and we live in an age of instant gratification, drugs, sex, we want to feel good now. So people cheat more and more without thinking of the consequences...  Paternity Test your babies people... 
Dude, Mister Incredible really let himself go. Meh. Looks like Jack-Jack still loves him. 
Your mom did tho
Most people don’t 
Guess who's getting a divorce because even suggesting that is unforgiveable
Triple bypass sure, but pass on the paternity. 
somebody grab him some clippers,

 his fuckin beard is weird
Soo she had sex with multiple guy to need paternity test? 
Gingers
This is Bobby B
That bearded giant looks just like you. 
Hmmm IDK, could be your brother's kid?
Do you have a brother?
Hey, it's me, your brother. Take care of my kid k?
Did your wife date Tintin in the past?
