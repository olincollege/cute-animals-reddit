I like that he waits and listens to the high note before resuming his borkera.
What a beautiful room and patio too
A dog of culture I see!
This is the greatest thing I've seen all week
As an opera fan I can firmly say he adds to the wonder if it
That little head tilt when Luciano hits the high note 💕💕
Very cool to see actual video footage from heaven
Luciano Puparotti
His little smile as he decides to make it a duet
Pava-doggi
I will find the bone

I will find the bone

I will find the boooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnneeeee!
oof got tears in my eyes. beautiful music.
Opera dog is classier than you are.
Golden Believer
I would love to know what the dog is understanding and what it hears. Is it the boxes, some sounds we can't even hear.

He/she clearly trys to communicate in some kind of way and it seems like he/she is focusing.
Dog: Hooman singing Nessun dorma, my favorite! 

Pavarotti: All'alba vinceró! vinceró, vinceró! 

Dog: Awoooooooo
I’ve never had a dog that reacts to any artificial sounds (except fire alarms). I played this clip for my 8 month old Schnauzer. No fucks were given.
Good taste.
I showed my son this same perform on YouTube when he was a baby because classical music is good for their brain development, yadda yadda. I wish I had his reaction on video, because he was in his exersaucer, and his whole face suddenly open up like, "whhaaaat", and he popped himself around as fast as he could to see where the sound was coming from. That kid stood stark still and just stared until the very last note, I kid you not. I almost shed a year over how touching it was, especially as a former opera singer. Just lovely, man.
Adding some solid bass

Nessum dogma
What a cultured dog
Nice! When the three tenors were in Los Angeles in 1994 for the Football (what is soccer?) World Championship.
Great DVD of this Concert, highly recommended
When he tilts his head 🥰
It is a beautiful song sung by one of the greatest tenors of our generation.
Good doggie has good taste in music!
He attac

He protec

But most importantly, he sing a duet
I have no idea why, but this made me cry happy tears and also piqued my pups' interest, so I will gladly take and give the encouragement, for what it's worth!
wHAT SONG IS THAT
Italia '90.  Oh the memories.
Spooky. I was actually just listening to this in my kitchen. Had a random thought and asked alexa to play this song. Then came to poop and find this in my feed. Spooky indeed.
He loves singing paw-pera at sunset 👍
Listen to him hit that pawsetto!
Beautiful sunset! Great performance 😉
Dogs really do have music tastes
Dude this place is gorgeous
Love this video.  And thank you for the reminder of what a remarkable singer Pavarotti was.
Beautiful home
That house is also beautiful
u/redditdownloader
Cute doggo! That sunset tho.....
This made me miss our Golden, Boo, who loved to sing along with Beethoven, Missy Elliott and his favorite, Clint Eastwood by Gorillaz.
@50 second I always feel like Luciano is seeing the gates of heaven or is spiritually awaken after that breathtaking performance.
CEASAAAAAAAAAAAAAR!!!!
The entire scene feels like a Disney movie. So wholesome.
I loved how he waited for the last bit 😍 Adorable
Your neighbors must love it too >:D
This has everything. The head tilt. The howling. The walk back. The head turn. Perfection.
Must be Turandog
My pup heard in-person guitar for the first time yesterday and just about gave himself motion sickness with all the confused head tilts. I almost lost my dang mind
Thank you for the serotonin.
[removed]
Love the standing ovation.
I thought the singer got Thanos-snapped from 0:50. Closes his eyes and accepts his fate, having woo'd the woofer
Had this on mute and still recognized the song haha. Is that video from when he sang at the sydney games?
Awwvaroti
Quite cultured , my dog just prefers watching monkeys on the nature channel.
Awww the doggy is trying a solo!!! Go little furry friend!
This is amazing! I always get chills when I hear that song! Doggo recognizes the perfection!
Man OG general Zod could sing
This opera-loving dog and the beautiful sunset are amazing!
That cute little head tilt though! :3
Puppers was thinking about trying to hit that last high note.  But he let the guy have his moment.  Love it. :)
For a second he looks like he got lost in the song.
Nessun Dorma hits.
Nessun Dogma
I love when his face lights up, "that's my jam right there!" and runs over <3
Feels like a disney movie about a dog that wants to be an opera singer but the humans don't recognize that he's actually super good at it because they only hear barks.
Fun fact - Pavarotti was so large when he died they couldn’t find a hearse big enough and had to use a camper van - it was a Nissan Dorma
“Oh no! I must save man in the box crying for help!  I will help you alert the others!

AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOO”
Can’t blame the dog for loving some Pavarotti. I mean who doesn’t love Nessum Dorma?
Nessun Dorma if y'all looking for song name.
Was he staring at the sunset at the start of the video?!?! Ugh i wanna cry
One of my favorite songs too! That dog has unbelievable taste in music.  He’s a classy boy! Bravo!
Dog was about to walk into eternal happiness before coming back to aesthetic happiness
Look at Pawvarati over there, singing along.
Years ago, I adopted a Collie who was neurotic as hell. One day, I put on a recording of Pavarotti. She laid down next to the speaker and blissed out. His voice does that to me as well.
This was me as a little kid. Every time I rode in grandma’s car she had to put on the Pavarotti tape or she’s never hear the end of it. Then I enthusiastically sang along, probably not sounding even half as good as this handsome pupper.
Pavarotti was so great. It brought chills listening to him right now. I’m going to YouTube and check him out LoL

Edit: spelling
Pavarotti was truly an amazing singer.
Pawvarotti?
That's pretty loud to be playing with your door open like that.
[Here's a link to the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWc7vYjgnTs)
This Dog and I could be very good friends!
Dog howling at human howling.
[Perhaps the best use of that man’s singing that I’ve seen.](https://youtu.be/RCFyBvmcM_8)
Oh hes classy mine is scared of her own farts. But I love her
Man... I am in love with your house. So cozy!!
That’s our dog’s favorite too!!! She sang along with your sweet pupper! [sing along! ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ieziyOB)
Doesn’t this mean it’s hurting his ears though?
I wish my dog would appreciate opera this much
PAWarotti...
Caninus culturus
Poochini watching Pavarotti!
Nessun Dogma?
What a home!
Paw-varotti is excellent!
He's a man of culture.
Dog: As you see the human sees, so you see I sing.
Of majesty and wonderment, it is no laughing thing.

What chiding I have ever known,
Always lesser kin.

But in his eyes I see the rise of something greater than.

So when he sings I do too, to share that great surprise. And be a peer even in fear, of what I see in his eyes.
this is beautiful but what i’m really interested in is that incredible sunset in the background
I would pay to see Pavadoggie sing.
This is like the climax to a kid's movie where the dog had to cross the country to get back to his home.
Of course he'd howl to Pavarotti:  that bright head voice.  Less likely to respond to Domingo, who had a solid chest as well as the head voice.  Try exposing him to a recording of Maria Callas:  he'll howl the house down!
just imagine if he could see that guy live.
That sunset though..
Caeser.........
That dog has exquisite taste.
So fucking adorable
What a beautiful Duet.
This is beautiful.  It even looks as if the dog went to go smell him at the end, but couldn't find the scent.
Best duet I’ve ever heard
Dog got class! I bet it drinks milk every morning wearing a monocle.
14/10 for the doggo singing
So cute. I cant tell if he's saying PLEASE make it stop or if he's trying to sing along. Either way I love it
Bro my dog doesn’t even recognize my voice over the phone
a single upvote is not enough 😍
That's a labradorable
Good dog.
Man I wish my house was that nice. Some of you have no idea how lucky you are.
This makes me happy, thank you.  Nessun Dorma is amazing, Pavarotti was amazing, your dog is amazing.
Who doesn't love Pavarotti. It you know who that is  then I think your haven't been cultured yet and need to get your brain out there. We have the damn internet now and can research anything we want and learn what we want. I come from a time when a 10 year old encyclopedia and an old stack of nat geos was the most you had at home to see the world. I'm 32 btw.
This wins Reddit today. Bravo pupper!!!
No lie im trippin pretty hard and the way they look at eachother just makes me so happy it's honestly hard to describe.
Do you live in paradise?
Oh my goodness, I want a dog who loves Pavarotti.
Thunderous appaws
He even sings along!? Eeeeeee I can't🤩🤩
My favorite artist, my favorite song and my favorite pup. Your sweet pup sings very well. He has great taste in music ❤
I love how the dog stopped and just looked on in amazement when Pavarotti hit the high note.
its to cute I cant even
This pup's got class.
Man, good voice. Really nailed it.

Pavarotti’s not bad either.
(S)He's a true BASS-et hound. Love that deep treble!
Pavarotti channels the spirit of God in that moment. That moment transcends space and time and penetrates the soul of anyone blessed enough to hear it. The dog knows this and celebrates and merges with the eternal moment.
I love this!!!
I'm here for the puns
yo why do people live in places that look like heaven
Make him the Fourth Tenor!!
He's a man of culture.
Wowwww
Dogpera 😍
No one tells this dog where Pavarotti is!! Let it be happy!!
I understand him
[removed]
I was hoping he was going to start singing along such a classy good boy
"Preach it, man!"
I miss yards.
Too bad mines deaf
Hmm I expected WAP
Poochini!
he’s trying :]
Golden retrievers are officially The Goodest Bois™
He has good taste in singers
Anyone familiar with the science of Dog-barks know what he was saying?
Pavarotti. That dog is classier than me.
And music moves the spirit. Beautiful.
Anyone else notice that when the dog barks, the guy jumps a little?
I do the same!
Sky and the yard is beautiful also
Your dog is the reincarnation of Pavarotti
My dog would do this every time my mother played the accordion ❤
Kinda wish Pavarotti was still alive so this dog could meet him
Please, Stop Im melting too much wholesomeness
My dogs favorite music is imperial march played on the violin
Dog has better taste than me ಠ﹏ಠ
Dog has fine taste
I have the same reaction. Great song, bravo!
I love that aria. The dog has good taste.
Ooof cutie pie 🥰
I was so distracted by Pavarotti I completely ignored the dog.
Classy guy
Wow
My wife does the same.
the way he tilts his head on the best part!
Dog wants to out howl him I think.
This pup is the live version of The Great Poochini!
Nothing warms my heart like a howling dog!
This is amazing 😉 So adorable and such a joy to watch.
I’d play this for my dog every damn day if it made him this happy
Ok I've heard this song but what is it's name? I dont like much opera but I like this.
Pavlovrotti’s Doggo
The fourth tenor.
Cute
I’d love to know if this extremely good boy likes other renditions of this magnificent piece, or is Pavarotti his paw-ticular favorite. 

I also love the [Aretha Franklin version. ](https://youtu.be/zZNrvT-jhm4)
I wanna hug that dog so much.
Well, that's a great song! That dog has great taste.
What’s the performance hooman is listening to? Can anyone post link$!
Ok but that sunset is beautiful
Dogarotti
Finally a fluffy good boi who also has a good taste in music
Luciano Pavarotti and Placido DOGmingo
Understandable .This Dude (i forgot His Name)is a Legend.
He got the last note :)
Pawvissimo🐶
Rock those fucking drums dale!
Dogs got good taste for Pavarotti
Dog’s got good taste
He saved jazz
This is absolutely is what my morning needed
SHIIIIIIIIZAAAAA
Encore!
My favorite opera: TuranDog
The neighbors must be having a lot of questions
R.i.p your neighbors.
When dogs evolve enough to take over the planet. Clapping will no longer be the norm to show appreciation. It will be howling!
That is the best!
Song to go with the wildcard haha
That is the house of my dreams. I love that view. 💕
Nessun dorma indeed. In the middle of the night with my dog it’s nessun dorma.
I think if humans could learn why dogs do this both of our species would be so much happier :) :) :’)
OMG are you kidding me????? One of my girls does the exact same thing with the exact same song!  She has the cutest howl when singing along. Maybe they should colab sometime (?)
That's soo cool!
Woah this made me tear up lol
Opera boi 14/10
Me too, pup. Me too.
I feel like there’s a Disney movie here...
Awww...that's cute.  My brother likes Pavoratti too.  In fact, I think I recognize that song.  :)
My cat loves loves the sitar on Love You To by the Beatles. He comes running out from under the bed when it comes on.
My dog responds like this whenever the Flower Duet is played, even softly in the background score to a movie.

But I’m not entirely sure if he loves it or it’s just hitting an uncomfortable pitch for him.
This dog has amazing musical taste!
Dude, I'm. Jealous of that whole freaking set up😍
That is heckin precious
My little Yorkie will not acknowledge the TV or music at all. I think he's broken.
The Champions!!!!!
The dog is amazing of course but that sunset is out of a dream
I needed this.
Im deadass looking at the singer like 'Dammit man, look at the doggy! Acknowledge him!'
Videos where dogs make noise are much more enjoyable to watch when your own dog is nearby just got so many head tilts.
**WOOF**
dog has a feelings
That dog has better taste in music than my husband
Beautiful dog and also, that's a really beautiful house with nice backyard.
He was feeling this song just like Pavarotti did!
The sunset in the background, too!
I've always thought the idea of reincarnation to be pretty interesting. Things like this get me
Does anyone have the link to the Pavarotti video? I want to try this on my dogs now.
Love when he does a head tilt like “hey I can hit that note too”
Very nice house.
He’s just a big Champions League fan
Doin a heckin Stan!
I knew it was Nessun Dorma just from the thumbnail, watched that performance too many times. Dog has good taste (and so do his owners).
Was he expecting the football to start?
My pup howled along to this, so I guess she's a fan, too.
Next pixar movie idea
Indeed, none shall sleep with a dog doing that.
You can’t make this stuff up!!
Soooo cute!
You go, Lucio! - Dog probably
My shiztsu's would always lose their shit anytime Personal Jesus by Depeche Mode came on.
They went wild for those drums
Are you sure he is enjoying it? Sounds like dissaproval for me. Try Caruso and Corelli for comparison.
This is a bit like how I reacted the first time I heard this, minus the drool.
Why do dogs do this?
The neighbors love this.
Such sophisticated taste.
I would pay good money to see these two preform live together
Strange... I have a very similar reaction to Luciano singing Messing Dorma.... Am I a dog?
KK Slider IRL
Man, animals seem to love Luciano! He's my cat's favorite, too!
Everytime I hear Pavarotti perform Nessun Dorma I get chills, and clearly that dog does too
Yes doggo Italia 90 was the best World Cup in living memory. Paul Gascoigne was brilliant
I like how the dog reacts to the changes in pitch then responds! So cute
I believe he died 13 years ago today
Its just hurting his ears.
More evidence that dogs have soul, music touches
the soul.
So cute
@ me when Snoodle gets here
A real Turandog!
That dog has had no classical training
Pawvarotti
Can we talk about how stunning this house and backyard is though?
Reminds me of my friends singing along to the radio
How can I download this video?
Pooch has a great taste
Ah Pavarotti, one of the greatest tenors that ever lived  


Also, here you go: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi1nTz3nlTc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi1nTz3nlTc)
I worked in a hotel he once stayed at while on international tour. They installed a custom tub just for him, as part of his rider. Probably the fanciest suite in the city, and he wanted MORE. It was really more of a hot tub, than a bath tub.
I'm exactly the same whenever I hear Pavarotti.
Was this song in “The Talented Mr. Ripley”? I’m trying to remember what movie I just watched with this in it
My dog died nearly 11 years ago, but she was a massive 125lb mutt who also loved opera. This was great to see.
👏👏👏👏👏👏BRAVO!!!!!!
Good taste doggo!
Yoooo!!!!, yooooo!, Yooooo!!! -the dog
This is the kind of life I envy
As musician you know you’ve only truly succeeded if a dog likes your music.
Sounded like the doggo saidn"Bravo" at the end to me...
There was that video of a dog meeting his favorite mascot. I wish to see what would happen if this dog happens to have private audition by this guy.
Nessun Dorma. I cry. He howls. It's all good. ♥️
Is that Placido Domingo? Not sure, but if so, I bumped into him and his adorable Rottweiler in an elevator at Lincoln center in the early 1990s. Was so busy loving his dog I didn’t know it was him until after I got out of the elevator and my mom was like, “that was one of the great tenors of opera!” I wonder if his Rottie also loved his performances ☺️
Turandog
He obviously prefers Metallica
I get you on this one, few songs can make me cry like this one
I like his taste
Italia 90
Luciano Pawvarotti
This is

# a door a ball.
I wish my dog liked music. If she doesn’t I haven’t found that song or artist or genre. I’m also fearful it will be something Cardi B or Nicki.....
This feels like a start to a disney movie
So one of my neighbors has a beagle - and they are very vocal dogs.  This beagle will howl along to anything, including police sirens and people revving their engines at the nearby intersection.  For some reason, it's more hilarious than annoying.
*lumberjaaaack*

I’ve traveled 900miles to give you my seed
Your neighbors must love you
My cat Vader and I would watch YouTube together all the time as a kid. He had favorite YouTubers and genres too. Everyday after school we’d sit down together in my recliner and watch stampylonghead (Minecraft youtuber) for an hour. He wouldn’t just sit there in my lap doin nothin either, 9/10 times he’d be actively watching what was on screen, or if it was something he didn’t like he’d either go to sleep or he’d smack my screen.
Cutest damn dog I have ever seen!!! Make me melt in joy.
Guess that is pavroti recarnated as a Dog. Your still the dogs bark. :)
could watch this for an hour or two..
Play that dog wolves by Kanye
Neither here nor there I guess, but I once had a cockatiel who loved the whistle song at the beginning of The Andy Griffith Show.

My parents watched it every afternoon, and when the whistling began, he went nuts.  He never missed a note whistling along with it, and he would sometimes spread his feathers and do a little happy dance.   Quite often when it was not even on the TV.
Awww my Placido Dogmingo
Dogs got great taste in music. And a voice of an angel.
I fucking love this
Goodyear boy, let the master have the high note
He sings better than me
To bad he's a Labrador, because Pavarottweiler would have been a great pun.
I love this so much
Pavarotti was a legend
Your neighbours must love you 😄
Its puparoti!!!!
Everyone loves Pavarotti
Can't believe I'm saying this, but what does LOZ mean?
Me too buddy
He probably thought it was the champions league
That moment when the dog is like “bruh, I don’t know if I can reach that octave”, and then does it anyway
A dog of culture and howls in tune as well!
[turns to my dog]

See? This dog listens to classy music!

[dog ignores me and turns up "All Star" by Smash Mouth]
Doggo knows whats good
DOGO: all hail the greatest of all time!!!!!!!!
Hey, it's Enrico Pallazo!!
Pavlovs Dog meet Pavarottis Dog
Dogs are the best!  Give him to me!  (please)
Man I love a good dog head tilt
When I was a kid we had a beagle who used to howl to pretty much any song by The Cranberries, it was beautiful to witness. RIP Buck.
What if he was alive in his past life and liked that song then.
For some reasons, all I can think of is "O Sole Mio!"
Nessun Dorma hits me in the feels too, pooch
This dog has excellent taste in music. Give that good boy all the pats!
This reminds me of the guitar guy with the kittens.
Poocharotti
His last public performance at the olympics is amazing.

https://youtu.be/rxxHvW0oNpU
What ya that song
Pooch-ciano Paw-a rotti Edit : auto correct fail Poochiano Paw- varotti
Just asking for the ask... but wouldn't that pup have super sensitive ears to this music blaring in his or her face? Lol
My dog sings to DMX's Party Up in Here, and I never have figured out why. She just started doing it one time when she was a puppy and still sings when she hears it 12 years later.
[removed]
Regardless of the dog, I got goosebumps, beautiful singing.
Puppa aged 4. Likes sunsets and opera
Such a beautiful doggo! They're better than we humans, no doubt about it.
The sunset in the background completes everything
My friend has a maltipoo who does this, but only when he hears a french horn!
That’s so cute!
Can you check to see if he’s a fan of my friend John Hagen and his [rendition](https://youtu.be/b8ctLmwgjWk) ?
When the song starts he's like: 

"Wait, is that my song?"
This heals my wrecked soul.
 riposi in pace Pavarotti. September 6 2007.
Pixar enters the chat
That dog has good taste
His head turn!! Awe puppers!!
Of all the things I expected to hear, I’ll admit this wasn’t one of them.
My dog does that when I play the piano!
My childhood best friends dog did this when we sang happy birthday. She absolutely loved that song and would sing along with her absolute best effort :)
Nessun dorma is one of my favorites too!
Opera is basically human howling if you think about it.
My parents dog absolutely loves classical and piano music. She gets excited and does spinnies when I get out their keyboard to play. I dont know why she loves it so much- we raised her from a puppy and didnt expose her to it any more than any other music. Shes also a cream lab.
That sunset and living room though 😎😎
Lol the head tilt at 36 secs is awesome
A Supreme video. And I'm sure he really is into that song. But everybody knows that every dogs favorite song is "Who let the dogs out"
Dogs are too pure for us.
Twist; doggo was Pavarotti in his previous life.
I love it so much!
Forza Pavarotti
Good dog
When I was a kid my cocker spaniel would sing along to Dean Martin songs as well as Sammy Davis Jr.'s "Candy Man".
This dog has excellent taste.
Nessun Dorma will do that.
Ah, Luciano Pavarotti performing Nessun Dorma from Turadont act 3. Great taste, your dog has.
That dog has a great taste in Music!
Adorable
Me sing good too. See?
This made me cry, thank you!
What a good boy.
That dog's raw emotion is compelling

Edit: that chubby dude isn't bad either
Pavarotti belts out that piece like it's barely even a challenge.
Just what if Pavarotti reincarnated in that dog and just wants to perform as when he was human...
The dogs a better singer than I am. 😂
Ill cuore!!!! Such great awooo’s!!!
Dogs ears hurt that’s why they bark
I see puppers has good taste!
Is anyone else noticing that beautiful sunset in the background?
Such power and grace. Oh, and the opera singer was good too!
Dog:  
Arooo!!  
RRoooo!!  
Rrroo!  
\*wait what?\*  
\*oh okay\*  
RRRROOO!!
I've seen this happen once before. It was friends dog and the song was marcy playgrounds sex and candy.
What a good boy!  A dog after my own heart.
Dog sings pretty good actually great duo.
God damn has there ever been a singer with more raw talent?
His world burning behind him
My old roommates cat would come sit on me and purr when I'd sing and close his eyes. He was such a sweet cat and I loved singing to him.
Does anyone know the name of the song? Would love to listen to the whole thing.
This is too wholesome, I'm going to wholesome jail now
NONE SHALL SLEEP ARROOOOOOOO.
I love this so much
Dog sounds like Marge Simpson.
I hope he gets to meet that man one day
tilts head when his mouth gets bigger
My dog used to howl/sing along to most British TV soaps. Emmerdale was his fav and it was the first main soap on each night. As my dad would watch it daily I always knew it was 7pm as I would hear Harley (my dog) howling along.

I have the video somewhere I will try and upload it soon.
I react the same way to Pavarotti.
Love it.
Here's one. If you ever see a guy chewing gum to a singing contest just pack it up.
https://youtu.be/ERD4CbBDNI0
Bougie dog
So I just played the video and my cat immediately came to me. I now have an armful of cat.
A budding Pawvarotti
That did my heart good!
Both them boys got some pipes!
I truly needed this today.
I have a friend who is a Queen fan (that's how we met) who had a Beagle named Barney. When Queen's *The Miracle* album was released, my friend (like all rabid fans) played it repeatedly. The only song - of any of the Queen or any other artists' albums my friend played - that Barney regularly reacted to was "I Want It All"...he'd roo and howl along with it every time it was played.

[https://youtu.be/hFDcoX7s6rE](https://youtu.be/hFDcoX7s6rE)
I react the same way!🤣
Love this clip. The Three Tenors in Dodgers stadium in Los Angeles. I wish I was old enough
Ilsa Faust!
Now do Meat Loaf.
My friend has a dachshund and he will start howling anytime Amazing Grace is played
Pavarotti is a tenor. Paganini was a composer.
Was this the performance at the Olympics? I was watching it a couple days ago but only found potato quality online.
Who doesn't love Pavarotti singing Nessun Dorma! Cute doggo.
What a sunset!
My dog woke up, stood up and cocked his head when this started playing
I love this so much!  :D
This Dog will be the Beethoven of the 21st Century 🎶
got to play this piece in highschool at a music convention in Chicago. hearing pavarotti sing it gives me chills now
What opera is this?
Somehow I had a feeling it was going to be nessum dorma.
Beautiful duet with the great Andrea Barkcelli.....
I wanna see more animals with favorite musicians. I want a heavy metal loving dog that would be SOOO good
My heart has now opened
Great taste
H
Is it fy_italy song?
Such a music living floof!
That’s my dog’s reaction whenever the fire department goes by... coincidence?
Nessun Dromina performance by Luciano Pavarotti is one of the best songs out there.
whose dog joined in?
u/vredditshare
I bought Turandot at a random flea market this year, not knowing what it was, and I guess Nessun Dorma's just going to pop into my life any chance it gets now.
Sing along if you know the words!
I have the same reaction.
Y'know this explains alot about how the 50s and 60s seem to always had the meme of dogs and cats howling all night
I like how he waits for his spot after the big crescendo.
TEN THOUSAND YESS’
I have same experience with my doggo when I sing :D
This has to be one of the most sweetest things I've ever seen on Reddit, and this is coming from a cat lover.
What a boi there you have..
Beautiful sunset
Their house is really pretty
Lmao dog has good taste
We need to get this man to meet that dog
Where’s r/schnoodlesdoodles. This would be perfect

Edit: spell sub correctly
Damn, he totally nailed it!

Good boy!
Dog's getting really annoyed by the end
No other version compares, doggo has great taste.
And so was born HMV
That's so funny. We recently got a rescue puppy and when my kids practice piano she does this but only at at certain times in certain songs (Mozart's Turkish March and Coldplay's Clocks). We couldn't figure out if it was because she liked it or didn't like it, but her tail wags so we're figuring she likes it.
 Noup. Its ears hurt.
This dog is like the Airbud of music
VINCEeeEeeEereErEeeEeEeeeErrrrrrrrrrrrr
What's the name of this opera ?
Nessun Dogma
Doggo sounds better than me singing along to Pavarotti
God damnit. I cry every time I here that song and then you add a puppers. I'm bawling!
We studied papa Pav in my vocal pedagogy class. it was actually pretty sick. His voice resonates stronger at the second formant rather than the first which is likely what gave him his trademark sound. His father was also an amateur singer and avid fan of opera. Luciano grew up singing with his father and even has a video or two of them performing together!
Pavarotti always slaps tho
My dog likes to sing along when my mom plays the flute
 Maybe if I put 24 hour Cinderella in my dog will do the same ?
Pavarotti. Doggo has good taste.
Good choice, doggo!
There will never be anyone like Pavarotti again. So sad that he's not with us anymore.
 I do the exact same thing when I see Pavaratti
Plot twist: the dog is Pavarotti incarnate.
I give my **Bow**celli to your **Paw**rotti
What kind of dog is this? Labrador? Cute dog
I'm convinced dogs have the souls of past humans. This doggo was definitely Italian
Italia 90 was over 200 years ago in dog years!
Pet the damn dog, Pavarotti.
Yes
Ah yes, Luciano Pavadoggi, my favorite.
i was waiting for the licc HAHAHAHHA
he got good taste
These videos make me believe in reincarnation
I do this when I dog sit for my parents. I just yell at the top of my lungs. Soon the dogs are all joining in with me. It's truly beautiful.
I think I lub him
This looks like a dream sequence!
Amazing
Made my day
Nessun dogma
Pawsarotti
The dog's reaction is so very cute but cripes I hate this aria so much
To See this doggo sind along is so cute
Profound pupper
He’s singing along!
#Pavarotti, is that you?
I haven’t thought of Pavarotti in probably 20 years.
That dog needs a pair of headphones and a record of that performance on loop
Luciano ❤
Nessun Dogma
My dog's favorite song is Lola by the Kinks. That tells you all you need to know about him
Made me howl along
How cute aww
Thank you so much for sharing this with us!
A dog of culture I see
He has better taste than some hoomans.
Why does this video feel bittersweet? Like I feel a light dread watching this.
He loves nessun dorma by Pavarotti? That's a dog with great taste
Yeah but does he love it... or is he begging it to stop?
My brothers dog does that to some inappropriate song by jarimiah when the bass hits
Human: Aww, look, he loves this song! He's singing along! So cute!

Dog: Oh god... not this song again! Stoooooooop! Stooooooooooop!....  Staaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwp!


Side note: The mofit around 0:40 of this video (the song is Nessun Dorma) is one of several in the song that are very reminiscent of motifs in *Phantom of the Opera* (this one being used in "Angel of Music"). Given the musical is *about* opera, I always assumed this was an intentional homage or tribute to Puccini, but I was surprised to find nothing online from anyone connected to the show referencing this - only a couple of references by other people like me surprised that no one has ever mentioned it. Other example: [this violin line](https://youtu.be/cWc7vYjgnTs?t=67), and [this resolution](https://youtu.be/cWc7vYjgnTs?t=89) reminiscent of "All I Ask Of You".
Is his name Pawvarotti?
At least some youths these days still appreciate the opera
Good boy, knows all the words
Dogpra
That walk up to the TV "Hey! I was singing with you! I think I deserve some pets!"
This dog's going places
When Pavarotti hits the highest note, dog is like "Okay can't touch that".
How I think I sound singing in the shower VS how I actually sound singing in the shower.
This dog has better taste in music than many.
I don't have any money for award so here you go

Unfortunately my shitzu is afraid of anything that plays audio idk why plz help
So funny, there's surely a scientific explanation or can animals appreciate art?
Pavarotti, good choice dogger
Johan Sebastian Bark
That is so darn adorable! 💕
Golden Resinger
Underrated sunset in the background too
Luciano Pavarotti!! RIP legend
What a beautiful, moving voice! Pavarotti’s is nice too.
He's just trying to tell you he was really good back when he was human.
What a lovely sunset
Is this a scene from some disney movie?
Me after a few drinks and Pavarotti comes on
Can't stop watching...
My dog does the same... except it's with her squeak toy.
This is my favorite Reddit post to date!
Puparotti!! Doggorotti?
This is absolutely everything I wanted to just rn 🤙🏽
you thoughts it’s pavarotti, but it’s actually doggo
Nessun dorma. Love it.
WOW! Handsome and a musically intelligent good boy!
The three tennors!

He's the fourth tenor
Good taste, doggie
Am In the only one who noticed Wow what a dreamy place and house
At 34 Looks  like  that dog looking at the record player face. RCA.
Spore: **"Civilization Stage Unlocked"**

Brain Size 5 unlocked you can now explore space
❤️❤️😅😅❤️❤️
Dog is seriously impressed at how long he can hold that note 😂
Damn, dudes got some pipes. The guy on the TV is ok too.
aww what a good boye!
I swear my little Italian Greyhound and Vizsla used to sing this, after warming up with some doo-wop!  Rusty could keep a bass line and Leo was Frankie Valli.
I mean, it is Pavarotti.
Doggo has a future in theatre
Doggo didn't try for the high note. I don't blame him.
Pawwvorati
what's the name of that singer,
my dog favorite song was 
Gwen Stefani - The Sweet Escape
Is that Barbara Streisand
no, get in and out
!remindme 16h
i love
Dude, he just disappeared
My first dachshund would start yelping, howling, and crying when the 'Young & the Restless' soap opera song would come on. As soon as he heard it, he'd start up and we'd all start petting him and saying "It'll be ok. Victor and Nikki will get back together!" and he'd calm down. It was so sweet and funny. That was the only song he ever reacted to.

Great video. Well edited too. We get the whole adorable experience.
That sunset though...
Luciano Barkaratti.
I'm crying. It's that beautiful.
Luciano Pawvarotti!
This was some relief after the traumatizing video of the evil grandmother threatening to rip up that girl's family pictures.
That's Enrico pallazzo
The Doggo's video reminded me of seeing Pavarotti in S.F.

I used to live in S.F. I was taking the Muni - 47 Van Ness -  near the Opera house going north on Van Ness Avenue. This is where I had seen Pavarotti driving in the opposing lane going south. 

3 things I remember from seeing him:

He was driving a Maserati alone. The car was a so-so color, Pantone 2438 C. I figure if someone could buy a car like that, you'd want to paint it black, dark blue, or some other color. But, ok.

He was wearing that one goofy, squashed beret that he'd always wear while playing tennis or going out informally. And, 

He looked absolutely terrified driving down Van Ness! Traffic was not terribly crazy at the time, but he sure looked panicked.

Every time since then whenever I see a video with Pavarotti in it, I think of that day.

Go in for your finale, Doggo! 🐶💖

Pure?
Can't decide who sang it better lol
Their poor neighbors!!
u/vredditshare
Wasn't that Pavarotti's last performance of Nessun Dorma before he died? I would have given anything to be in that crowd. My granny loved him so much, but as an old Irish woman she pronounced his name 'Paddy Roddy' and it was the cutest thing ever.
Goosebumps! That song always give me goosebumps!
While most dogs are howling to pop songs, this classy doggo does opera
I think this is exactly what I needed today!
Awwwwww
Dude, i feel the same way, pavaroti makes me emotional too
Dog vibes to Pavarotti
ADORKABLE!
Your neighbours must love you
I loved the Pavarotti video before the dog. Now its just the best video ever.
Reminds me of listening to Andrea Bochelli
u/vredditshare
This dog has more culture than I do
Pawvarotti
Excellent taste, and pretty good pitch!
Now I don't believe in reincarnation but that dog definitely was a singer in his previous life
Brouwwww
Nessun Dorma inside and out.
ALL'ALBA VINCEROOOHH
Saved jazz
Im crying this is so beautiful. Pavarotti is a legend
I do the same when I hear Luciano
Pavarotti could sing! The dog has good taste
Tenor awoo
made my day better. TY
Tickled my chakritos this done did
He was a singer in his former life.
Serious question, though not everyone believes in this stuff.

I wonder if in his past life Opera/Pavoratti was something he truly loved and made him happy. He'd go with his wife whenever they could travel to a show. 

Now he's a dog, but the music still triggers something inside him, which makes him so focused and excited and happy. His howls are like 'BRAVO!'

Or it's just a happy dog. Fun to think about.
Such a cultured good boi Pavarotti would be proud
Ha, their almost people.
That's amazing.
Doggorotti
This is the same opera from Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation
What a good boy yes he’s such a good boy
What a classy doggo.
Better voice than Pavarotti, IMO
What I would give to see Luciano in person
Triumph the Opera Dog. Dog totally knew Pavarotti nailed those power notes towards the end and he couldn’t contain himself.
Maybe the dog likes fake Pavarotti with real Sepultura and JBO even more :D https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNcIxcAjNjE  
The Studio version is called "Pabbarotti & Friends: Roots, Bloody Roots" from J.B.O. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnKoAUyU5Y
You’re gonna start a howl!
Paw-verotti
Ah, a doggo of culture
fuck i nearly cried, this is honestly beautiful
ratatouille but instead of a rat its a dog and instead of a cooking its opera singing
What song is this
Great Pyrenees love high note songs. My familys pyrenees loves the song Non, je ne regrette rien
My dogs favorite song is Shenandoah by Ernie Ford 🎶
hmm,  I would think a dog would prefer classical Chopin or something like that,  but I suppose this works as well --  more exciting in fact.   He sure got into it
Watched this downstairs with my roommates dog and he legit perked up from sleeping the exact same moment as this dog did. Also a golden retriever
