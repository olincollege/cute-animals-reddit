Finally a good reason to arrive 2 hours early to the stadium!
My dog would have shat on the ice. He’s special. 
This reminds me of legendary hockey coach, Roger Neilson, who once brought his dog on the ice to help teach forechecking. 

If the opposing player has the puck behind the net, and you go behind the net to get him, the other guy just skates away on the other side of the net. It rarely works out when you chase the guy behind the net.

The dog, however, didn't chase the puck behind the net, waiting instead for the defenseman to come out in front to show Neilson's emphasis on patience.
At first I thought this was going to be borderline cruel but nope, the pup is pretty darn good and maneuvering on the ice.
I was afraid he was gonna slam into the wall 
This needs to be the halftime entertainment. 
They'll like this over on r/hockey.
If this were my dog, it would be bambi on ice. Love the guy, but he has all the grace and handling ability of a shopping cart.
My dog tore its ACL just looking at this
Four pawed drive looks pretty effective on ice!  The happy tail action takes a toll on his gait. So, happy trots/gallops are a thing!
This dog understands stopping distance on ice way better than most humans... 
ABS ABS ABS ABS got it!
smart dog, he learned to slow down the second time 
The Air Bud franchise lives on
"2 minutes for RUFFING"
that's a hockey hero i'd look up to
"Ain't no *rules* says the *dog can't play* \[hockey\]."
It’s cute but the pessimist part of me is worried the dog will pull or dislocate something while running on ice. 
Absolutely adorable watching him slip and slide over the ice 
Two minutes for ruffing
Dog smiles are awesome
How great it must be to just experience pure simple joy.  No worrying about house payments, sickness, horrible neighbors.  The only thing on your mind is getting and returning that puck.  
Goodest forward ever!
Go Caps! and more importantly, Go Doggo!
"This tastes like crap. You got any tennis balls by any chance?"
APD = All  Paws Drive
ABS, traction control and 4 paw drive.
Goldens are absolutely the happiest dogs in the world. 
Damn look at that anti lock braking!
Hey is he running way left of the puck?  Oh, smart dog!
That dogs better on ice than myself. 
I think all hockey players would be better off if they had wagging tails!
This is why my dog looks like playing fetch on the hardwood floors. 
Shortened his stride to get the icing - veteran move.
Retrievers gotta retrieve 
Did he predict the puck would bounce off the wall? He seemed to be on an intercept angle the whole way. Pretty awesome. 
It's all fun and games until he has to go number 2 
Goldens. The only breed that could successfully pull this off with style 
& grace.  Goldens are the best!

Oilers should try and get him before the trade deadline.

It was cool to see that the dog understood and was expecting the bounce off of the wall.

I was just worried about him blowing a knee out
LET'S GO CAPS!!!
cute D O G G O
Fuck hockey, I'll just watch this for a couple hours.
I can watch this video all over again
do his paws not get cold from the ice??
That’s just Alexander Ofetchkin.
Needed to add a comment so it wasn’t 666. Blessings friends. 
He protect, he attack, but most importantly, he bring puck back
So afraid that my dog would get an ACL tear doing something like this.
Looks like me trying to play Rocket League.
I would very much like to know who's dog that is
If hard wood floors are hard on dog’s joints this just seems cruel 
Dogs are so good
Having a hecking cold but gud time
Get on your feet!
The new air bud is looking great
I'm glad it was smart enough to slow down before slamming into that wall
Good doggo
Oh, so THAT'S why they call them retrievers!
the best of boys
Happiest boy on the ice.
ZOOMboni!
slippery boi
Tippy tappies 
The first run was only to get to know the ground, on the second run he nailed it. Good boy
He's so flippin' happy. 
Doggo has great control on the ice.  I figured it would've wiped out when near the boards.
Good Content™
If I showed up to a sporting event and it turned out to be just this, I’d buy season tickets. 
/r/hawwkey 
he's so proud! good boy :)
This dog is a great athlete. Bet he's going to sleep well tonight
Well that's just golden!
Icy boi
This made me smile 
Four leg drive. Good traction.
Weird how a dog can keeps it's balance on ice but the second my dog touches the hardwood floor, he does the Scooby Doo run and wipes out
My dog would have slowly walked to the puck and laid down. 
therapeutic 
I could have watched that for hours.  Please tell me there is additional footage. 
"There's nothing in the rule book that says a golden retriever *can't* play ice hockey."

&#x200B;

I want to play fetch with him. 
He had his speed to slide ratio figured out right after he bumped the boards. 
So is no one worried about the doggo having its bare paws on the ice?
Don't let Tom Wilson anywhere near that dog.
He even compensates what a good boy
Wow! He's got skills!
It is 11:54PM and this is the best thing I've seen today, and I'm willing to say nothing else will be better in the next 6 minutes.
I could watch this all day. Wish there was a sub for this xD
This is so wholesome. Amazed at how well he slows down from that run
Yes I am dog

I love the ice

When master throws

I dont think twice;

I zoom full speed

Might hit the wall.

But that's just okay

Still I got the ball.

I run right back!

Spit ball on floor,

Then once again

He throws ball once more
Look at the pure enjoyment. 
Oh wow, still says Verizon center, must be pre 2017. what a good bork
And the crowd goes wild 
Pregame traditions are getting better and better 
The bestest boy(or girl)
I would pay to watch this. 
My poor old pup can’t get this much traction on my kitchen floor.
Look at its tail wag!
I'd rather watch this than hockey anyway
People please don't do this with your dog. This is a great way for them to blow out their knees. 
All I see is this dog tearing an ACL..
My dog just had double all surgery and this is terrifying to me. 
As a lab owner who went through a dog with a torn ACL, this makes me nervous. 
I do not own any of the content in this gif 
This is how you end up with a dog with a torn ACL.
God damn I want a dog 
We don't deserve them 
I am pretty sure he clocked in at a little over 50km, watch out Conner McDavid you got ur self a rival 
The ice landing gear on this guy works very well. 
Quattro. 
I like how he learned from the first time around and avoided the wall on the second throw. Smart boy!
Unusual to see dogs happy on ice.

During a tour of Madison Square Garden back in 2001, we were told the only time the ice was melted was when there was a dog show, as, even with boarding and mats, the dogs were nervous walking on top of it, even 'tho they couldn't see it.
r/dogswithjobs get cool perks too 
The sides for some decent traction
Better than my golden on wooden flooring.
No take only throw
I could watch that all day.
Master of all dogs drifting
That's one surefooted dog.
At first i thought it was going to be a dogberg. Good doggo :)
Bad news: He didn't make the team.  
Good news: He's still a good boye.
That 4 wheel drive, tho
Watching him try to stop himself from sliding makes me smile more than it should
They really do live up to their name, even on ice.
Tryouts for the next Air Bud movie? 
C-A-P-S! Caps, caps caps! 
r/nonononoyes
I wish I could of upvoted twice for this.
Cute
I like the “nah bitch it’s close enough, throw it” barking at the beginning lol 
I could both do this and watch this all day. What a good dog. 
All I can think about are how cold his/her little paw pads must be! Lol
Looks like a good boah
I thought that the puck was something on my screen and tried to wipe it off for the whole GIF.
Is it going to poop?
Now why didn’t they let him do this while the crowd was there
The dogs pretty smart, after he hit the wall the first time he used his feet to slow down the second time and even then the first time he hit the wall he just slimmed it. This doggo deserves an award!
He spins his tail at the end, im pretty sure its cuz hes losing his balance, but it looks like he did it to slow himself down like a little propeller.
How sensitive to cold/hot surfaces are dogs paws? This dog is clearly unfazed by the ice, which made me curious. 
I hope his little pay pads arent hurt
Yes!!!! Best version of puppy bowl !!
If you like that, you should see me dog play defence!
I expected to be outraged after jumping to the conclusion that the dog was being lured into injuring itself. Then I was relieved. Then I was impressed.
nice breaks! I was expecting a major dog-body-slam into the back boards...
He’s obvi having a blast, but man does that also look frustrating!
r/dogsonice
//imagines Viktor Nikiforov doing this with Makkachin//
I love this. Made me smile. Thanks. So stressed about tomorrow. Needed to smile. 
Needs audio 
That dog is really good on ice!
Clearly this dog hasn't seen rock em sock em. Supposed to go into the boards on angle so you don't get hurt

Impressive stop time
Very cute
Pretty good breaks on that thing. What is that, an ‘09?
I love how he uses his dog butt as a brake towards the end. 

Edit:(or she)-(or her)
My golden also refuses to drop the ball closer than 10 feet to me
Four tea per sent
Go get em boyyyyy
All fun and games until somebody tears an ACL
That dog sure can play Awww-key....

...

I will show myself out.
“PICK UP THE PUCK, IDIOT. IT’S GAME TIME!”
He did infinitely better then I would’ve 
Good dog.
Doggos got ABS after the first miscalculation
My puppy would be in absolute heaven if she got to do this!
His traction control is amazing!!
Looks tiring

It’s been a good day for dogs and hockey.
Hahaha, that's because dogs are so smart
He’s such a good pup because he knows to slow down on ice :)
[deleted]
If there is a half-time show this should be it.
this would be my dogs dream!! 
This made me smile a lot ❤️
If you guys like this you should check out the Instagram @nyrangerspup...the NY Rangers have a puppy that’s training to be a service dog for a child with autism and the account is definitely good for some awwws
Serious question. Why does his tail rotate counter clockwise and then clockwise and then back again?
Thanks for the great eye bleach at the end of the day.
This is exactly what I need in my life right now. Ty OP.
Don't fuck with that doggo. He's one fierce mother.
Is that Ovi's dog?
Honestly, this is how players get hurt.  Because idiots like that guy bring dogs on the ice. 
SUCH A GOOD BOYE
He's definitely done this **many** times b4.
u/bamborythms I present you a double tag today, love ya buddy
Wow. Much cute
That dog does better on ice than I do on land
If it had been my dog he would have pooped in front of everyone. And then I’d have to walk out with a little baggy and pick it up. Then everyone would blame all the bad shots on the poop spot. 
Never seen a happier dog 
12/10 would fetch with him
This should be the Half time show for next year's superbowl. Just a dog on ice. Way better than Adam Levine.
C A P S CAPS CAPS CAPS!!!
Advantages of paw wheel drive. :)
Air bud #26.
Put him on the team
How is it that ice rinks don't have pull on ice cleats for people to use on the ice? 
Looks better than the CAPS last night.
The Capitals should do this before EVERY game right before the players take the ice to start the game. When most people are in the stands. It would be a HUGE hit...
NO!NO!NO!NO!NO! … <whew>
This is the kind of pregame show I can get behind
Oh fuck that's a good boy!! Look at him zoomin!!!
That’s my dog trainer!
/r/AnimalTextGifs is needed 
I see the Capitals emblem but this is the most Canadian thing I have seen today. 
He's so damn graceful!
Good clear!
This dog has better control on the ice on bare paws than I could ever hope to have with any kind of footwear. 
The best. 
Hockey Zoomies!!

Retriever plays retrieve on ince before NHL game.


FTFY
Ice Bud
Just fulfilling his life’s mission
DEAFENING CHEERING
Air Bud dis you 👀
Fuck this made me smile 
Ladies and gentlemen, in fortunate delay, the game will be postponed for ten more minutes. Please enjoy the retriever the rink in the mean-time
/r/praisethecameraman
Weren't they worried about his tongue freezing to the puck or the ice?
Does the ice not kill the pads of his paws? I can imagine with no barrier that the bottom of his paws are super cold!
I expected a lot more sliding
He's got better control than I'll ever hope to have.
Love it!
Smart dog! He slowed down the second time to avoid slamming into his human
This is amazing. Is there a subreddit for dogs playing on ice?
How not fall 
Painful to watch this since my dog casually slipped in a park two weeks ago and had to go through 2k€ knee surgery ans still can't walk properly. 
Zambowwowni
Let me just go... RETRIEVE it 
Dog has antilock brakes.
Air Bud 5!
Stops better on ice than I do.
Where can I get season tickets for this? 
This could be a very promising new sport!
What a cutie! 😍
I like how he struggles to hold his balance but runs just fine on the ice.
Am I the only one hoping the owner doesn't slip accidentally?
Give this good boy some boots, cancel the hockey game and I'm sure we can fill up the stadium with people like myself that are just willing to watch this, drink beer and eat cheap nachos for 2 hours.
Biggest lie this exposes?  Cartoon wolves unable to run across that frozen lake are shite!

&#x200B;
Puck that was cute 
tl:dr it was a ruff game
needs sound... the crowd better be going wild for this pup! 🐶🏒
Seems like 4 legs makes it easier to walk on ice.
J
God that's so cute.
Capitals arena?  Doggie is Alexander Ofetchkin.
They always try to do fancy between period entertainment, but this is exactly what the people want. 
When I immediately saw the shadow of the "Geico" logo on the glass, I immediately knew it would never be my own NHL team's rink :( 

That said, this needs to be more of a thing.. as long as they don't get hurt by sliding into the boards. Awesome dogs rock!
Really cute but it isn't really cold for it's paws?
It's rare that you get to see arthritis develop in real time.
Frankly, I'm disappointed that 'We Are The Champions' wasn't playing in the background the entire time. That old pupperoni was the true winner that day.
slidy boi
I like how he start running before he throws, do dogs normally have good predictions or they are trained?
That put a smile on my face. Thank you!
4 wheel drive is sweet
Better skater than Michal Kempny has been recently.
He runs across the ice like it is turf.
Washington Capitals? Nahhh, Washington Doggos
Awh so cute
Am I the only one worried about the dog accidentally sliding off and choking of the hockey disc?
THE GOODEST OF DOGGOS EVER. Look how fucking happy he is!!
Dogs faster through the neutral zone than ron hainsey. You think I’ll throw on a sweater and play d?
Doing what a retreiver does best haha
I'm amazed at the traction that doggo has on ice.
Golden boi ran just like on tracks.
Dog is smart. It knows to slow down as it approaches the wall.
Making deer look like wanna punks
Hey u/vreddit_bot 
Well, now I want every NHL team to do this before games please. 
#HockeyIsForEveryone
Cool as a cucumber calmly crossing the cold surface, catching claw to control careening, carefully keeps it in his craw, cants it back to the crotchety caster, what class.
First with sweet victory now this the NHL is on a roll
his paws not hurt ? walking on the ice naked like that.
Police dog?
10 minutes in the box for ruff-ing.
Impressive balance I must say.. But how is this safe.

&#x200B;

Easy to rip apart ligaments or whatever else.
Amazing set of brakes on this guy.
TIL humans need claws. 
I feel like i would pay more to see a bunch of fogs do this than I would pay for a nhl game ticket. 
I would pay to see that dog shit on the ice
Paging u/SchnoodleDoodleDo please work your magic
only good thing the capitals have ever done 
So glad the dog didn’t the wall hard
Hustles on the backcheck, forechecks hard, always good at passing to his teammates. 
noNONONO DON’T GO INTO THE BOARDS....whew!
It’s insane how good his traction is on that ice. He basically sprinted just fine and only slid when stopping 
That dog is more aware of slipping and traction than most Vancouverites I've seen driving in the past two days.
four-heeled drive.
This is awesome and the dog looks like hes enjoying himself. However, dont let your dogs play on ice. They can very easily tear something or hurt their legs.
Running on ice like a pro!
Hey this happened at Cap One (Formerly the Verizon Center)! Go Caps and screw the Pens baby!
That dog has antilock brakes!
Yikes that is not safe. I have labs, and dogs that size get hurt often on much less slippery surfaces 
When my dad and I go to a near by pond and slap puck down it. My dog loves running and grab it. He doesn't like giving it back tho. So we use 2 pucks to play fetch.
The strut when it picked up the puck after the first throw was pure swagger.
The kid can play.
I don’t know hockey but I know retrievers and that pup will go until she gets carried off. Or treat.
Golden's are surely god's greatest gift to mankind! All they know is love. 
What a smart doggo! Pupper knows how to slow down on ice better than I on skates!!
Can we just watch this for an hour instead of the game? 
That dowg has fur wheeled drive!
I envisioned doggo slamming hard into the end boards. 

Very happy to be wrong. 
"There's nothing in the rule book that says the dog can't play!"
I'll trade you half of the Ottawa Senators for the good boy and a washing machine. It's a low ball offer for you, but he's playing better than that tire fire.
/u/vreddit_bot 
I could sit here & watch this all day. 
That dog...played the boards really well.
This dog works security, but instead of chasing down the suspect for the takedown, he draws the suspect to him for pets, and distracts the suspect while security can sneak up unnoticed. 
Dogs on ice are actually VERY bad for their joints. 
Now that’s a retriever!
The joy this brings me.
Solid retrieve, 10/10.
Yet another post with a police and a cute animal? What the hell is going on with reddit lately?

[just leaving this here](https://i.redd.it/je34nhyjk7u11.png)
That would be me if i was on ice
I like how at the same time he's running after the puck, he's testing and evaluating the surface he's running on.

Genius doggo.
Best
1. That's an icing
2. I'm surprised the dog hasn't tripped on the ice and fell on his ass. Whenever I'm skating, I'm guaranteed to fall on my ass (well that's because I'm a terrible skater).
Didn't they already make this air bud?
Aren't his toes cold?

Such a bo'!
Love the way it brakes on ice 😊
These Air Bud movies are getting lazy...
when you just wanna play chel with the boys
It’s posts like this that help get me through work. Puts a smile on my face. ❤️
He has amazing traction on ice, damn!!
I'm impressed that he never changed direction on the run but instead waited for it to hit the wall and bounce into his path. 
Air-hockey bud!
I’m impressed the dog has good balance on the ice. 
lol at the guy who loses an edge on dog hair while on a breakaway.  (I know I know, the zamboni will hit it one more time before the game...or will it.....)
he's doing so well!!!!!!!!
His anti-lock braking system had to kick in.
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen. This is it. 
Slapshot and the Dog need to do a photo shot together!
10/10 Would watch this as like a pregame show or maybe a halftime contest between lots of puppers 
Still better than Mac's big break
Go caps!
Retrievers melt your heart .. 
Incredible paw control. Hardly ever looked off balance.

I get the feeling if my dog tried this he would not fare anywhere as well. Slamming into the boards at 20mph and then crying to me after because that solid wall "snuck right up on [him]". 

But I still love him to pieces!
I C E  BOI
That was icing.
Omigosh he's so happy. I love him! 😍 
Smiles
Better than any Halftime show. 
r/gifsthatendtoosoon 
My old golden retriever broke his hip while out for a walk, while stepping on some ice.

Just here to say be careful!
Hey, that's icing! And twice! Fuckin refs, man.
Lol my lab hates hard wood floors, this is his real life nightmare. 
I have horrible anxiety that the dog is going to trip up and choke on the puck😖
Goodest boi
Good ice boi 
I say let him loose during a game for extra excitement.
Do they put chains on dog feet when they go on ice ? 
😍😍😍😍 this is so amazing haha.

Although I’m worried about the puppers break pads, the pads under the front paws. My puppers ripped open when we were playing fetch in the dog park and it’s been two weeks and still not healed 😭
F wheel drive 
I’m dead 
Pup is really good at this!
Beatiful
Good way to fuck up the ice before a game. Time to pull out the Zamboni
He runs better on ice than I skate o.O
Anyone else notice the guy tries to get him to come to him but he doesn't so he relents and throws the puck instead haha
My little lab is so smart too; she always starts sliding on my hardwood floors just before fetching her toys.
Buddy there lacks good traction control, all of that pawpower is not being transferred to the ground.
Do their paws freeze, walking on ice?
Was anyone else encouraging their screen out loud with great enthusiasm like

"git it git it git it git GIT IT GIT IT GOOD DOGGIE, THATS SUCH A GOOD DOGGIEEEE!!!!"
This would be the best halftime show
HE IS THE BEST BOI 
It would have been cuter if they put a little team Jersey on him as well!! 
CAPITAL ONE ARENA IN DC LET'S GO CAPS
Air bud II: Ice Bud?
Hardly even dazed by the ice 
The Boston bruins announce that they have signed this dog to a 4-year/$24.4 million contract with a limited no trade clause

When reached for comment, general manager don sweeney said he liked the dog’s grit and determination.

Captain zdeno chara is happy to have someone hairier then him on the team: “come playoff season, I’ll have a lot of work to do to match his beard.”

Longtime fan favorite Patrice Bergeron is enthusiastic: “I think this kid will give Brad [Marchand] a run for his money when it comes to pure energy.”
I'm actually impressed how good he can run on ice
if it's too cold for your hand it's too cold for the dog?

&#x200B;
That's an impressive amount of on-ice dexterity 
Reminds me of my dog today playing g with a tiny pebble with her feet it was so cute
Watching him/her slide to stop kills me. 
Good dog; don’t slip
Man he is really sure footed on the ice i did not expect that at all ...i have a feeling my lab would be all over the place, but maybe not i guess?
That's Golden!
Smart doggo. Knows how to slow down and stop early so he doesn't hit the wall or the man throwing. Had to watch it a few times to make sure...and then a few more times just because.
That's pretty cute tbh
I love dogs but I was really hoping to see a dog-wall slam...
My lab would go full speed, head first into the boards and never stop.
Yes
There's something strangely relaxing about watching that 😁
I would pay more than the price of a ticket to the Stanley Cup to watch this for 3 hours.
I know he has 4 legs but that running on ice is still impressive 
At first the dog was like.. "THROW IT THROW IT FUCKING THROW IT"
That pup is in the zone! Such a happy little guy. 
Awesome......
/r/gifsthatendwaaaaaayyyyytoofuckingsoon
Funny and cute, but this seriously risks an ACL tear. Dogs' knees don't handle slips well, so be careful!
Look at that tail! What a good boye
Wow! This dog can seriously handle itself on ice, most dogs I've seen are super unsure of their footing/balance. It's probably played on ice since puphood
That dog needs some booties.
My sister's Shepherd can retrieve for hours. It's what he lives for. 
r/mademesmile
Just love the fact how he learns to stop way before he reaches the destination...
Dogs are so fucking awesome!
I wasn’t expecting the cop to huck it as far as he did 😂
Heart officially melted.
Oh Wow Really Amazing And So Cute ummahh 😙😙😙
This is how they test out the ice so they know it's good and slick.
this is very good boy behavior. 
God I love hockey. 
Dogs are surprisingly good ice skaters omg
It’s interesting how he spins his tail on the ice, using it for balance I see
This is ignorant. A bad slip on easy can injure a dog for life.
That’s one hell of a good boy.
i love dogs
MVP
OMG I love him 
I could watch this for hours 
He ended up +3 vs the Oilers first and second lines for the night.
I love how he's wagging his tail the whole time. Such a happy doggo 😍
Look at that little Wolfie go.
New replacement for the puck drop: whoever can get the puck from the good boy first gets possession.
My dogs hip dysplasia is crying rn
Am I the only one who watched this just hoping the doggo was going to shit ones the ice only to be disappointed? 
GET ON YOUR FEET 
Awesome ❤ 
You could make a religion out of this
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
The new Air Bud looks dope
Nothing like the scooby doo style acceleration during great foggy terror or excitement to make your day. 
The happiest doggo
Man, those paws work pretty great on ice. 
Oh look, that retriever is retrieving! 
Aye he laggin my guy
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
He clearly likes it!
Good boy.
The best thing i have seen all day
NHL IS BEST N[]L
this may be the cutest thing i've ever seen
r/hawwkey
I don't think he's going to make the pros.
It doesn't give a puck.
I love that Airbud movie
Traction control on!
That's it, I just want there to be a sport of dogs on ice now.
now this is sweet victory
she's so happy!!! I love her
That dog has definitely ran on ice before
Can confirm. Is good pupper. Deserves canadian fetch. 
My dog would also poop on the ice after running for 5 minutes..
love how he/she mastered breaking 
You can tell this pup grew up on the ice. If I just plopped my 6 year old dog out there, she’d be sliding everywhere and probably tear a ligament.
Surprisingly grippy 
And here I thought I hated Hockey.
It delivers...
That's a dog that's used to being on ice.  The new ABS!  Adorable Breaking System!
For some reason, I just thought of the lights out bag skate scene from Miracle.

"AGAIN" 
That is one happy dog
0:24 - dog looks at ref like "WTF no icing call?"
Nice
he is playing his own game
This dog learned how inertia and friction works at that instance. He knows he has to slow down on return
2 minutes for ruffing
So much yes
My naym is dog 
I have a fren 
He takes me to
The game again

Before the game starts
I lik to say
Come wif me
On ice to play

I go on ice
An I'm in luck
My fren throws
I catch the puck

How does he have such good grip? He's going all out, I would expect him to slip way more. Are dogs' paws that good with ice, or is having 4 instead of 2 legs such a big advantage?
Good dog. :)
There's now never going to be a day in that rink where there isn't at least 1 single dog hair *somewhere* on the ice.
Too cute
That game i would watch
Did ppl cheer when he got it? I bet they cheered when he got it.
Quiet, my black heart.
He's having so much fun. What a good iceboi
The way the dog drifts when he runs on the ice makes him look green screened
Police dog?
Is his name Lightning? I hope it's Lightning.  'Yeah, but can lightning run on ice?' :P
Just in case anyone doesn't know about it, /r/hawwkey is an adorable place.  Enjoy.
Take my upvote and stay here, you beautiful redditor
This should be shown during the period breaks.
No wonder they call them retrievers.
Where in the rules does it say that a dog can't play hockey?
longer video? I could watch puppy do this for hours

Too cute 
He’s having a blast 
Still a better passer than Ovechkin
Cute
I like how he learned from the first time around and avoided the wall on the second throw. Smart boy!
That's why I like hockey, nobody made a fuss about him scratching up the ice. I feel like in most other sports they would say the ground is being damaged and will affect the outcome of the game lol
I cannot stop thinking about his poor bare paws on the ice
Poor fuckin dog is gonna break a hip .. 
Awe, I wanted more sliding.
this website is starting to make me want a dog so badly I could just die

I was expecting this to be my friend's service dog. [Ginger became a meme sitting on the Bench wearing her custom Bruins Jersey](https://i.imgur.com/4TOMHtG.jpg) 
Omg his poor freezing paws. They will need to amputate now. :(
Am I the only one that saw the german panzer battalion cross on the ice painted ?!?!
Sorry to burst your bubble but that dog is running with hip pain... probably from previous spills on the ice

Edit: I’m an ER vet
This is a dangerous thing to do, especially with a big dog.  He can dislocated his shoulders, be crippled for life, and suffer arthritis later in life.  
Best thing I've seen all day. Not because of the hockey cuz fuck hockey, but cuz the dog. I'm always afraid of my lab on ice.. 'fraid he's gonna break a leg.. glad to see this boy has it under control.
Yeah, I’m all about this.
I need an ice rink!
What a good doggo
