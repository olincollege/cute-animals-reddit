This is terrifying
Question? What color is his actual coat black or white?
For anyone interested the dogs name is Zeus and his owner is Katrina short. Look her up on Instagram. She owns her own shop and is a great person. I've been taking my dogs to her shop for years and always does a great job.

Why would you waste this on just Halloween?  My poodle would be that all the time.  I
Poodles are the literal best. People only think of them in their show continental cut, but they have so much fun variety like this, or the timeless curly puppy cut. They are an underrated gem because people can‚Äôt see past the fabulous hairdo.

How do they do that?! Do they dye the hair? Poodles have hair right? Anyway, I want to dye my dogs hair! If it‚Äôs safe obviously.
This is Katrina‚Äôs dog!!  Not sure if this is Kevin or Zeus, but her dogs have also been giraffes and zebras in the past, she‚Äôs an amazing groomer!!
Hahaha what a cool haircut on the dog üòÅ

Super cute during the day, but imagine being drunk at  night and walking past some yard with this guy rushing up to the fence barking...
this is funny n shit but i fear lots of idiots harming their dogs trying to pull karma
Why would you shave a dog like this? Yeah it's cute for about a month but then it's gonna take a while to grow back. Just leave your dog's fur as it should be and trim it if it needs to be trimmed

Poodles are one of my least favorite dog breeds, but this is just so damn cool. I love it.
Wow. And here come all the "professionals". Just because you did a shit at home shave job does not qualify you as a groomer therefore don't spread misinformation.  Jesus.  It is a legit profession that requires training.
What the fuck
That's talent right there
This is by far the best.
I have a very curly, white colored golden doodle (F1b). I think he could pull this off.

I thought we were keeping the spooky till Thursday.
Was genuinely confused as to whether that was a long-curly-haired dog that had been shaved, or a short-haired dog that had been dolled up with some kind of adhered material.  Pretty sure it's the latter, now that I've seen the whole thing, but that took me a bit before I could decide.
Really puts the spoo in spooky!
Look at it. It‚Äôs suffering. /s

Thanks I hate this
Sorry I didn't mean to reply to you as saying you were wrong. It was supposed to be to the comment above you just to clarify that the problem is not the shaving per se but how it's done  and ideally never down to skin level
Although I know poodle and other breeds like yorkshire sometimes gets "haircuts" like that. Maybe because it's more of a indoor company breed
