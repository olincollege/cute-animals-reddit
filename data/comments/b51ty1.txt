My dog has a best bud that he has not seen in a while and I made the mistake of mentioning her name the other night.. He started moaning and groaning and kept going to the door..We are going to hook up soon so they can visit each other and I look forward to it. Thanks for sharing as it's a taste of what's to come for my best bud.
Open that gate and let the snuggling begin!!!
This made my whole day
Move the gate dammit ! 
That caption is like a math problem.
If 1 dog has 2 besties from 5 months ago that are 3 cities away but 2 hours by car, how many head pats does a good boy get?
That extreme tail wag could amputate your leg, don't get too close
Can I ask where you live that 3 cities away equals a 2 hour drive ? 
Wholesome AF
You are amazing, OP!! She‚Äôs blessed to have you as I know you are to have her.
You could have kept all this joy to yourself, but you decided to share it with all of us. Thank you.
2 hour road trip + 3 cities away = 5 month wait 


OP you mathematical genius 
Mr Gorbachev, open this gate!
I thank you for this.
Why wouldn‚Äôt you show us the video of them without the door barrier you monster??
How dare you tease me with such short footage of this wonderful moment. I demand more. 
Best puppy parent!! 
Who's a good owner?!  You are!  You're a good owner!
This is lovely 
I'm a gruffly grown ass linecook and you just made me tear up on my 15 min lunch !! 
"Trust issues" and "Hard for her to make new friends", wow that sounds like me.
Only reason I haven‚Äôt gotten a dog yet is I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to handle when they pass away. 
Who's a good boy?

OP is the goodest of them all
Let me in! LETTT MEEE IIINNN!

Day is made. 
I need to see more!! I want to see a video update of when that gate gets opened!! Please?! 
THIS VIDEO NEEDS TO BE SEVERAL HOURS LONGER
Thank you for doing this!!!! and for posting it! üíï
You, my best man or woman, are a godsend 
Aawww this is so wholesome ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
After ten years, my dog lost her best friend this year. He was also a lab and a Very Good Boy. This made my day and I‚Äôm so happy for your pup :)
They‚Äôre all so excited ... it‚Äôs awesome 
It‚Äôs so amazing what they recognize.  If I look at my dogs a certain way, they‚Äôre ready to go!  Is it a walk, is it to go swim at the reservoir?  They don‚Äôt give a crap, they‚Äôre ready for whatever is beyond that front door.
I love that she keeps coming back to you like ‚ÄúOH MY GOD, DO YOU SEE WHO IS HERE?!? WHAT LUCK!!!‚Äù
Open the gate! OPEN THE GAAAAAAAAATE!
Love how she turned around to check if you were following despite all the excitement
You drove several hours just to let your pupper see friends.  And they say none of us deserve dogs.  You deserve your little angel.  Very well done, good human.
You're a good human being. 
This makes me night. Thanks. I think I might just accidentally deleted (still don‚Äôt know how that happened) my company‚Äôs file and i feel like getting fired tomorrow and I was panicking and dunno what to do. This makes me feel a bit better. Thanks. 
(in dog numbers that's a 30 hour road trip, 43 cities away from, 92 months ago)
Your dog has trust issues? Trust issues?!!!!!!! Lol
Those emotions are so pure!! 
that tail wiggle tho. She‚Äôs so happy

The third guy walks up. What‚Äôs going on? Oh it‚Äôs you hello!
 This level of joy is what makes dogs the best
r/openthedamngate
I love it when dogs are so happy they have to shake it off 
Three cities is a two hour road trip?! Where the hell are you 
A lot of numbers in that title
[deleted]
This is so adorable. Dogs are people just like the rest of us.
I can‚Äôt believe your dog managed a 2 hour car trip lol. Mine after 3 minutes is like, ‚ÄúRIGHT THIS WAS FUN LET‚ÄôS GET OUT NOW.‚Äù
She was smelling the friends as soon as you started filming. You can still tell by the tail position 
You‚Äôre a good person OP 
This is more like it. Unlike those evil bastards in that office.
this makes my heart hurt!

&#x200B;

I'm so happy for your dog (and for her besties)! 

But I'm sad for them too, that they miss each other!
This...is the sweetest thing ever! The happy butt wiggles!!
Open the gate, you monster!
[deleted]
"3 cities away from".   What does this mean? Haha
This is sweet and wonderful--but what does it mean, *to move 3 cities away*?
So I assume OP is buying the house next door? 
Wow. sorry to hear that you are being harassed by people for your post. At least you know that 95.3k people think you and your dog are awesome. Don't let a\*\*holes try to harass you with their made up delusions about your dog. I understand, my dog is the same. He is a beagle mix. He only gets along with my moms dog, and her cats. Even lets the kitten beat him up. However, if he sees a cat outside, he loses his mind. He is weary of people in his space and is protective. If he doesn't know you, don't get up in his space and his face it really scares him. Anyway, you seem like a wonderful responsible pet owner :) glad your pupper has 2 pupper besties :D
America is crazy. If I want to go 3 cities in any direction in Germany, I can for sure almost walk that in a couple of hours. (Most of the Time)

Seems like in the us you can maybe visit 3 houses. 
Damn I need to stop chopping onions while looking at this sub. 
One of the most awesome and wholesome things I‚Äôve seen in a very long time
These are the moments to live for, so much happiness
This is too wholesome. Ah my little heart
That‚Äôs truly what this sub is for 
This is beautiful and important.
I wish I had friends that were this excited to see me
BEST DAY EVER

Also open the damn gate! 
Open the gate so you can then get some /r/zoomies karma. 
You‚Äôre a good person. Let‚Äôs be friends 
BEST POST EVER
My pup is in a similar situation. She behaves just like this when she sees her old roommates! It's the best thing to watch.
I was crying about 15 minutes ago, and i really needed this. Thank you <3
Holly shit this is wonderful.  Awe.  
Zoomie alert 
Her booty is in maximum turbo mode!
They are so F'ing happy!!!
And I finally smiled
That is the sweetest thing ive seen in a long time. Brought me to tears
I just love how much dogs show their excitement in life ü•∞
So many butts wagging! So much happy! 
I think the most aww thing about this is she couldn't decide between you and her best friends.
My heart melts when I see animal friends so excited to be reunited! So glad you could make it happen!
Yes! My little guy also doesn't make new friends well, but my mother in law's pup is his best friend.

He starts freaking out when we're pulling in because he knows the turn into her driveway. 
It's like a whole conversation is taking place and we have no idea what they're saying..  
-"hey guys!! how the heck have you been!!??" 
She knew it was their house when you pulled onto the street, I bet! Or even when you got to the right neighborhood.
I want to feel that kind of happiness 
Heartwarming.
Open the damn gate!
you're the best type of pet owner 
My dog leaps 8 foot fences like it's an invisible line, how are these excited pups contained by that puny barrier?
This is so pure and wholesome üíü
I‚Äôm having a hard time figuring out your nationality or even the language you were speaking. I‚Äôm usually pretty good at that..

After the first clear as day ‚Äúwhere are they‚Äù I become lost
I can‚Äôt upvote this enough 
This makes my heart so happy!!!‚ù§ thank you
God, I love dogs
My dog and I moved 2,000 miles away from his best friends in the fall and I still feel guilty about it. I can‚Äôt even say his friends name around him because he gets too excited. He also has trouble making new friends but we‚Äôre trying out here. 
Good for you! Because animals have family and friends too.
No video in my time on reddit has made me smile like such an idiot. The best
This is so wonderful
Whos cutting these damn onions?! 
About how far is three cities? 
I love my dog's little doggy friendships. They're just so pure, And a side effect is that the owners and I usually become friends too 
This put me in a great mood for my fantasy draft. Thank you 
I think it is beautiful that you do this..I have struggled a lot socially and it is very kind of you to think like this for a dog. 
For some reason, I can only see 20 sec of this 30 min video. Is Reddit broken?
‚ÄúOh my god where you been?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been happening?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can wait to smell your butt!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this gate! ‚Äú
"Holy shit your still alive"!


"You to you sunna of a bitch"!



All dogs deserve friends 
The best thing I have seen all week. Thank you for the uploaded! Just so you know you just made someone‚Äôs day on the other side of the Earth. 
You are an amazing person. Great things happen to great people!
Dogs never lie about love. 
TAKE DOWN THE DAMN GATE
Let her in! LET HER IIIIIIIIN!
She's wagging her tail so hard her butt's shaking
That‚Äôs the sweetest thing I‚Äôve seen today! Thank you for sharing!!
My OCD really loves the numbers used in the caption they really just go together. 
I love this!!! My doggos best buddy died in December, and she still looks around for him upstairs all the time.
That‚Äôs super sweet. My dog has a girlfriend that he has played with since they were both little pups, he would be so sad if he couldn‚Äôt see her.
r/likeus
Love this! So so cute!
My dog loses her mind when her buddy Hunter comes to visit with our friends. It's too bad though he's a slow old man and can't keep up with her extreme enthusiasm. 
The clicky clack of excited dogs running can be so soothing
That was very sweet of you!
Dogs have deep emotional lives, bond,  and miss their friends when they move. It's lovely to reunite them. Did she have a hard time leaving? At least she now knows they're fine and they know she is too.
Hope they got to have a kickass sleepover!
Those happy bodywags ‡≤•‚Äø‡≤•

&#x200B;
This is so awesome and wholesome and stupendous I love you for doing this
My trust issues make it hard for me to make new friends.  Please take me on a road trip.
That's not how dogs work... they're not fucking people. 
The üíôüíôüíôüíô is truly unmistakable!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
[removed]
I wonder if she's happy, if only we could read dogs minds... 
Hate those hyperactive dogs that jump on everyone and everything.

Just bad trainer/owners who never disciplined or trained them properly.

Downvote me to hell for truth/opinion.
I'm so so glad you look after him but I wish you lived closer or they could have been homed together.

I help out at a cat rescue and the anxiety when removed from a close friend / friends can be overwhelming.

You are amazing for doing this üëè üëè üëè üëè 
My cat would walk half a mile back to my old apartment to hangout with my old roommates plot hound. They loved playing with each other. I felt bad when I moved back home states away and my parents dogs didnt know how to play with him as well as that plot hound did. But he did enjoy having a lot of woods around rather than houses and cars and dogs. 
Dogs don't have trust issues. You're projecting your own feelings onto the poor animal
You are a good parent 
I want to earn your dogs trust. This is the greatest thing I‚Äôve seen all day. Pups are so special. I‚Äôm sorry she has trust issues but I‚Äôm very glad she got to go see her friends!!!!!! 
Hi hi hi hi

Oh

Hihihihi
This made me tear up ngl
I needed this in my life.
you are the best owner!!! 
Cutest shit ever. 
Good doggie momma. Even pets need playdates
That was really nice.
This is adorable! 
I cannot handle the video cut off before the opening of the gate
This is what real friendship looks like üòç
Can u update with pictures?? Thanks! They are soooo cute
I absolutely love this!!! 

Also need to say-Nice Mazda!!
Getting a little misty here üòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

This dog has more friends than I do. 
Awww.

I think that tail just hit 88 miles per hour
That's just beautiful in tears for her and her friends 
this warms my heart
Well? Let her in there, dammit!
This is so bloody beautiful
My dog would react the same way to a dog next door...
This is the best video i have seen in awhile:)
Eye wateringly precious 
I can relate to how your dog feels
this video needs to be 1 hr longer
I want to see more!
this made me unreasonably happy
We‚Äôre gonna need to see a video of them playing. Thanks 
Ow my heart
Excuse me while I bawl my eyes out 
Goodest puppy dogs!!!!!
You are a good soul. Very sweet thing to do for your pup.
Aww
I was expecting you open the gate for  her. Then the video stopped.. 
What a good afternoon for everyone
They are her friends!! I wish someone would greet me like that!
2 hours for 3 cities that‚Äôs like 5 mins if you don‚Äôt blink for me 
I'm going to need more videos please. 
Aww so cute!
awh such a happy reunion
I love that her friends are just as excited 
that dog will never be upset to get in the car from here on out! 
Oh my god so many tippytaps
Def made me tear up a little. 
My dogs best friend had to be put down a year and a half ago :(
You're the bestest doggo pal <3
You're awesome!
And.... the her new boyfriend answered  the door. Awkward...

This made me shed tears.
That‚Äôs awesome !
Awwwww, I think I just melted.

That's how I feel when I see my best friends. 
So when are you moving?
This made my entire weekend.
This is just awesome!!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
Thats it. You have to move back.
‚ù§Ô∏è this!! Thanks for making my day! 
You're the best human. 
Forgot 4, would be made a pattern in the title
This ends waay too soon! Please upload the whole playtime.
What kind of dog is she? I ask because she looks almost exactly like my dog and I have no idea what breed she is. Thanks!
Omg there must be something in the air, where is this water coming from.... üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
r/megaawww
This is an amazing post!
Dogs are just the best! 
That's a lot of numbers for 1 title.
Awww! I bet she had an amazing day and needed a big ol' nap after :)
This makes me so happy :) 
Awwwwwww
You guys need to meet halfway, do it for the dogs.
Blessed video 
I couldn't smile any harder than when I watch this clip.
BRB. Going to ask my dog who I can take him to see
I had the bestest daddy momma said wanna go for a car rides. 
So happy happy happy long car rides so much fun 
Then I smelled familiar smells. 
Could it be could it be my friends
It's been so long.
Forevers an forevers my best good boy friends
We'll smell each other's buts and have all the funs
And then another long car ride
I bet I get to smell strange grasses along the way 
Such a long ride will surely have pretty potty breaks
u/Sarahnicole143 
I adore this so much
Too precious omg üòç
Wiggle butt and wiggle tail rocks
Do you think it's going to harm her trust issues to leave those dogs again? 
For two hours she was certain she was going to the vet
Everything is a surprise when you're a dog!
Amazing. They can hardly contain themselves!
What breed is she?
Take all the upvotes. ALL OF THEM.
So pure ‚ù§Ô∏è
Best dog parent ever!! She is so happy!
Literally sitting her crying at this and there's still a gate between them üò≠ üò≠ 
LET ME IN

LET ME IIIIIIIIIIN
Why am I crying 

That's  amazing.  Once, I wish someone  was  this happy to see me.
Her tail is wagging so fast that your camera makes it look like a blur
Is this the ending of the Dog version of the Shawshank Redemption? Your dog is Red and the others are Andy Dupree!
This is the most perfect precious shit
You are a good mom (dad?)
Next level tail wagging
I'm confused about the 2 hour drive for 3 cities away... Where do you live?! 3 cities away for me is like 15-20 mins tops. 
THE TIPPY TAPPY FOOT DANCE PLEASES ME
This is soooo fucking cute

The tail üòçüòç

Dude you are such a stellar human. 
Those two remind me of that dancing dog meme. 
Showerthought: to dogs, every visit is a surprise visit...
OPEN THE GODDAMN GATE!!! So unsatisfying. 
Poor dog will be so confused the next time it gets a car ride to the vet! lol
I love this so much I'm tearing up!!!!!!! Send love and kisses to your doggo and her friends!
The biggest smile of the day!!
You are a good mom.

You are a good doggo parent.
awwwww

Dog: LET ME IN!!!!
Holy fucking shit this is the most adorable thing I've ever fucking seen on this fucking subreddit.
I feel so fucking warm inside and shit and look at how excited they fucking are to see each other. I'm smiling so fucking wide right now. Fuck.
Love this! Love the labby coming sprinting in from the kitchen! So adorable. 
She looks like my puppers.... and equally as happy!!!
God wish it was warm enough where I am to leave a door open.
thats alot of happy slammy whammies and tippy taps
Good human!  Give yourself a treat.
That is SO SO SO SO SO SO  cute!! 
I love the tail swishing that shakes her whole butt!  So cute!
So wonderful of you to be tuned in to your pup‚Äôs needs. You can tell she‚Äôs delighted. 
Light speed tail wag.
Awesome! 
let her in!!!!
Awww that's so sweet. She needs like a monthly trip to see her besties. Everyone needs friends 
I love how her butt went into hyperdrive for a second.
You are a good, sensitive, understanding dog mom! 
propeller tail :)
I wanna say I would NEVER travel 2hrs for a dog but you never really know until you're in that situation.
That‚Äôs the best
That dogs about to achieve lift off with that propeller of a tail 
I'm Baaaaaacccccccckkkkkkk
r/LetTheDamnDogsOut
a good doggo

Happy doggo is best doggo 
You got any more videos of them playing, this made me happy
That is shear unmitigated joy. Nothing like it. So much wiggle butt.
"Girl i Haven't seen you in so long!"
Your dog is precious- glad she has bff's!
This is so cute! Reminds me of a couple months ago when I surprised my dog with trust issues with a 10 hour drive to visit his best friends
You are a good person.
This is how people should treat their pets.
Lol dogs are so funny
I hope he didn't think he was finally going home.
I wanna cry, this is so cute.
This is too pure. You‚Äôre gonna have to Uber your dog to her friends‚Äô house at least once a week now. 
collusion delusion
That‚Äôs all you posted?! Wtf
Nobody has trust issues with Labradors, I'm sure they were sweet friends
Open the fucking gate bro
This is awesome
Best thing I‚Äôve ever seen! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww ü•∞
Im not crying, you‚Äôre crying
Can I die now plis?
What a beautiful reunion!
Thank you. 
Open the damn door fast!
This is so sweet. I had a former stray growing up who was the same, didn't like most dogs. It was funny though how he had just a few who he adored, like his little friend Nicky or his "cousin" (my grandma's dog). Despite not likely 90% of dogs, he loved his close friends. It was terribly sad when his friends all started dying off and he was left dealing with the puppies that replaced them.
So much happy tail wagging :) 
r/videosthatendtoosoon

why you have to cut it at the good part OP ;w;
You‚Äôre the best parent.
If I had a choice to drive 2 hours to see my family or to see my dog this happy I would choose the dog. 
That is amazing, definitely made me smile.
Part 2!
Was fully expecting one of the dogs to just junp right over that gate lmao
Animals being excited to see other animals is like my favorite thing! 
This has made my heart happy ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
What breed is your dog? She‚Äôs so adorable
My dad doesn‚Äôt let me visit friends that live 15 minutes away that I‚Äôve known for months :T
What cuties! Now i gotta go pet my dog
This is the type of thing I love to see on Reddit. Please excuse me now, I think I left some onions out. 
r/Zoomies
This is the best!!
My dog's best friend was a 3 legged golden retriever named "Rocket". She passed from the same cancer that took her leg, but my Frenchie refuses to accept this 5 years later. He still moans & freaks out around her house. 
2 hours and 3 cities away. Those are some big cities
Wtf you drove for only 2 hours and went past 2 other entire cities before you arived at the 3rd.

IN ONLY 2 HOURS!!!!! WHERE IS THIS PLACE!!!
Dog has a wonderful new owner. 
The 3 of them could not physically control themselves any longer. Those tails could power the East Coast!! üòäüòÖ
Is this what you telling your wife? "Dog Visits"
Aw cute :) but how far is 3 cities away? 
Why the hell.... tell that family you're relocating them at your expense or move back,  you monster. 
You‚Äôre a great owner. Thank you for the effort you put for your best friend. God bless you 
I need this for like an hour
#this is so pure 
That tail
Ugh

It takes 2 hours to go 3 towns over?
That was a sweet thing to do.... Love you for loving the dog so much.... 
Dog tails seem like the most reliable source of renewable energy.
this is the best thing I have seen in a long time
Love this 
Not trying to be an asshole here but, i'm pretty sure I saw this video on Instagram like a year ago..
That is so unbelievably heartwarming. I want that for my dog every day.
Awww...just wanna hug him!!üòç
So wonderful! Did the other two doggies come out to play?
That was the LONGEST 20 seconds of my life! I was almost yelling OPENTHEGATE!!!!
LET ME IN
LET ME IIIIIIIIN
‚Äú...that SHE moved...‚Äù uhuh oookayy
You‚Äôre a true sweet heart.
Omfg so much wiggling!!! So cuuute
Damn this is so fucking wholesome.
That is one happy doggo.

&#x200B;

Good owner :)
Three cities takes two hours?
This is the best thing in the internet right now! This also goes in the internet best moments hall of fame! 
You're a good human. Thank you for sharing her joy of seeing seeing her besties again ü§ó
Have a Australian downvote





Edit: it's a joke
Cutest thing all day
You are the BEST dog parent üíï
That's nice of u
This is adorable. I think every dog is my dog‚Äôs best friend. He‚Äôs such a friendly little guy.
Open the dooooorrrrrrrr!!!!
How do you know your dog has trust issues? 
2 hours to get three cities away. Where do you live?
My dog would always spin in circles and jump like this when my dad would come home.  He destroyed the wood finish at our front door after years of it.
That is so cool!  You are a good pup parent!!
This makes me feel better than seeing my own bestie.

What kind of dog is she? My sisters looks just like her but we can‚Äôt figure it out 
let her in!!!
I had a rough day at work.
I just wanted to be home with my puppers and my husband and not dealing with shitty drunk customers.

This made my whole week.

Thanks OP. ‚ù§Ô∏è
2 hours to get through 3 cities?

It takes me almost 3 hours to get from Austin to Houston :/
I really need to do something special for my dog.
OPEN THE GATE
LOVE THIS
This is so wholesome and I absolutely love this. So happy your pooch was reunited! 
This is so beautiful. You're such a good human for your doggy. I'm going to cry happy tears. She's so loved. 
Is that house just wide open? No door?!
In the next life I want to be a dog in the white family.
Their tails look like they are gonna fall off lol
Take. My. Fking. Karma
Open the door already!! :')
You‚Äôre a good dog parent 
Made my heart smile! Now I can go to bed.
Featuring the Tail-wagging Gang!
Let him in already
Open the door!
/r/titlegore
Well if this doesn't win you points for 'best parent' I don't know what does. :)
Happy ass dog
So heart warming. Good on you, what a good dogo parent!
I legit love this post .. my doggie‚Äôs best friend got ran over :( this was 7 years ago, still to this day if I say his name , he runs to the door to see if he is there 
Happy doggies! 

They‚Äôre all so happy!
r/humansbeingbros
Safe to say this just made my day 100x better 
I‚Äôd definitely stand there filming her instead of opening the door. It‚Äôs the normal thing to do. 
Must have been hard taking her back home
Why are we supposed to believe this?
You're a good human. 
Everyone is so happy. My heart, it‚Äôs melted. I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!
Open the damn door!!
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon 
1. Totes adorbs.

2. So you moved 3 cities away...and those three cities takes you two hours? Is it like DC -> Baltimore  -> Philly?
Mason, the numbers!!!! What do they mean???? 
Blerg. I took my two dogs to visit another dog who had lived us with for 6 months. (Her owners lost their home suddenly and the only place they could find on short notice didn't allow dogs). The dog we were visiting got defensive and growled at us most of the time we were there.

I'm glad it worked out for you guys though.
RELEASE THE HOUNDS! 
Dogs are dog's best friend
You could tell that they could have totally jumped over that door fence if they wanted to; those are some good doggos.
Aww I wish I had a friend like your dog haha cute!!
Dog: open this barrier human or so help me!!!!!
'3 cities away' is a refreshing way to measure distance. I wish I knew what's the first city away from me
This makes me so happy, play well little pup, play well
You‚Äôre a great human
My heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Yet she still has good bestiesüòÅ
You are a great dog mommy. I‚Äôm so happy she got to see her friends. 
This subreddit is so much better when I‚Äôm about to start my period 
Awww this melts my heart, thank you for sharing. You have such a beautiful dog :d
~~/r/PetTheDamnDog~~ 


/r/PutTheDamnDogOverTheDamnBarrier 
Wish my friends reacted this way when I come back from my uni lol.
"can't hecken do a beleev"
You're god send 
Since when is a city a unit of distance? 
Ik this might get downvoted to hell but can dogs and other animals legitimately have trust issues?
I‚Äôm not saying you have to move cities, but have you thought about moving cities??!
You're a great dad.üê∂üêïüëè‚ù§

Oh my God that is the best. I need to seriously take note of any dog that my little buddy becomes good friends with.
I can‚Äôt even get my best friend to get me fries from McDonald‚Äôs 
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!!
That's so cool. It's hard to remember sometimes that these wonderful animals have memories, almost the same as we do. They can smell their friends from longer distances than you'd think, and when they finally greet each other it's pure joy!
For God‚Äôs sakes, open the damn gate!
It‚Äôs so awesome when they remember things like places and friends.  
Just like a nervous passenger pressing a phantom brake pedal, my arms were so restless watching this!!  Open the damn gate FFS!! <3
One of the reasons I could never have just one dog. Not the biggest.. that'd be self control.
Only 2 hours? Lol

Oh my heart! That's about the sweetest thing I've ever seen. Thank you so much for spoiling that wiggle butt rotten. 
I wonder how would a cat behave in this situation.
Open the gate! You Monster!
Omg my heart just melted, and now it‚Äôs a puddle on the floor! 
When a dog has more friends than you üò≥üòî
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Man if tail wags could somehow power generators, we'd be set forever!
What kind of dog is this? I have a stay dog I adopted that looks super similar and I have no idea what she could be
OMG the wiggle-butts!!!  Bless you for making them so happy 
I am not Canadian, so please excuse me if I am ignorant of any local laws that require it. But why is your dog on an leash while running around like that? Isn't it a hazard she might trip on?

The enthusiasm of the dogs made me smile. Thanks for sharing OP.
U deserve heaven
Gonna be a sad trip home lol
Stop making me cry.
This should be on r/donthelpjustfilm
TAKE THAT GATE DOWN!! 
This is the most beautiful thing.
That is just so sweet. I read the goose egg post ten seconds before this. Good remedybtobragecand upset. 
3 cities away seems like a relative metric...
Nice !
Joy unconfined. 
Aw I love the kisses in the end ‚ù§Ô∏è
That is me when i see ice-cream
It's always nice to see your doggo happy to see it's friends. But for what it's worth, you are anthropomorphizing your dog by thinking it's a trust issue.   If you haven't already you may find a good trainer, your dog should be able to make friends with most other dogs.  This might save you some gas money.
How do you measure distance in cities as a measurement? Like I have no idea how far apart these cities even are
Dude watch out she‚Äôs gonna sprain her tail being that happy
THAT. IS. AWESOME! 
I love the "ARE YOU SEEING THIS? IS THIS REAL????" When he turns back, it's all just so adorable
Hell of a waggin train!   
In Tennessee, 3 cities away means 10 miles.......
"Okay, you've seen your friends, time to go!"
Yeah being taken away from your friends sucks for everyone :/
How far is 3 cities? Is that a rural way of measuring distance? 
That's WONDERFUL!!!  Thank you for making this happen!

Immediately after this 19-second clip, OP said, "Alright! Time to go home!"

So u gonna let the dog in the house?? Hahahahah

Such wagging!!!!!
I‚Äôm getting anxiety waiting for you to open the gate. 
OPEN THE GATE ALREADY!! The suspense is killing me...

My dogs trust issues? Seriously lmao you probably go to star bucks every day for that juicy matcha latte
Dogs have to be the most human like animal in terms of emotion. Always have good boye energy.

Who doesn't love yellow labs !?
Aren‚Äôt they worried about flies getting into the house?
Aww, the oldest golden saying "I KNOW YOU BUT I STILL ALERT"
After the video ends, he puts the dog back in the car, drives away, and says, "and that's why you don't eat from the garbage".
Surprise her as in didn't tell her before hand?

Hmm
Confused by the phrase ‚Äú3 cities away from‚Äù. Are the cities numbered? 
What kind of measure is "3 cities away" ? :D

I‚Äôm not crying, you are
I straight up just cried tears of happiness for this pupper üòçüò≠
one of the sweetest things ive seen/read in awhile. what a great pet parent you are, just lovely. thank you for brightening my day üòä
This needs more upvotes. üòç
MY trust issues make it hard for me to let my dog walk off a leash like yours even tho he's done it a few times (always right next to me in case of anything) üòÇüòÇüòÇü§£ü§£
I appreciate how much you love and care for your dog. Good job. ü§òüèΩ
I cannot love this enough‚ù§‚ù§
You could drive two hours in any country other than America and still be in the same city
You are my heroüß°üíôüß°
This deserves more upvotes than there are people on Earth
Dogs can have anxiety?  All they do is eat, shit and sleep.
And then they got in the car and drove back. 


God, wouldn't that be sad.
This is what dedication is. An owner who loves their dog driving two hours so the dog can see her friends. Owner you are a good person.
Lol wow. Color me shocked. 

A Pit type dog being dog reactive/aggressive.
This put a huge smile on my face üíôüíôüíô
Made the anxiety 10 time worse when she had to leave
And you are the best dog parent today!!! 
you are an amazing person oh my god :‚Äô) 
We're gonna need more proof of this "friendship."

Or else.
You are the best doggo parent ever for this.
üò≠üòç
Awwwww üíõüíõüíõ My boi's bestie just moved to the side of the country last week (we're in CA, they're now in NY). üò≠ Broke my heart. 
I had never thought of dogs as capable of having "dog friends" before this moment and now I can't stop crying????
Who‚Äôs a good owner!? You are! You are!
r/letthedamndogplaywithherfriendsOPimeanyou knowshemissedthemforcryingoutsakes
Oh, you are the bestest of pup parents. This video made me smile and actually feel good
My dog is too trusting i have to take him outside without his leash because he refuses to move with it on and i dont reallly look like a good guy if you see me dragging a puppy across the sidewalk so he just litterally runs off with and follows whoever he sees and sometimes almost gets killed by other dogs or cars
Youre a terrible person for not moving that gate
So..they just leave their door open like that?..that's some white people shit, and i say that as a white person
We don't deserve dogs
