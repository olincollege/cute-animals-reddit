i am the cat - so regal me

awaiting here so patiently

maybe pause, before i roam,

or greet you as you come back home

to say goodbye as you are leaving,

comfort you if you are grieving

elegant - my regal pose

my feline majesty, it shows

i'll watch the world and guard this door,

reflect the ins and outs its for

reminding all - eyes open wide

whate'er awaits, on the other side . . .

This is the most royal looking cat I've ever seen. 
this cat is more attractive than my entire family
Beautiful.
Holy Mary mother of God, pray for me, that is a beautiful creature; my eyes do not deserve to behold such a wondrous creature. It‚Äôs tail is a northern stormy sea, body is Everest towering, pink lil nose a rose, eyes the crown jewel. A dignified regality beyond our dimension; something we will forever seek to reach in humanity, but something we can never understand. 
Can someone explain what the deal is with using "unit" for pets?
Exceedingly regal
r/absoluteunits 
That is the most glorious tail I've ever seen. 
WOW beautiful kitty! Read a lot of the comments below asking about cats on a leash. We have a near 2 y/o Maine Coon Mix guy from the local SPCA. Best 10$ we ever spent! We adopted him at 8 weeks and right away got him used to the harness and a leash while he was still a baby cat! He now knows thats the only way he can go outside. And the cat is just such a character! So much fun to be around. I will tell you, he is always is trouble! He looks for it! And once a week we have to clean under our bed becasue that‚Äôs where he takes everything he decides his his! No kidding, last week, he had a box of Frosted Flakes under there! That‚Äôs our BBLeroyB!

Ive seen this cat before. That tail is amazing from behind. 
Saw the same photo on the #MaineCoon instagram page.  Bunch of gorgeous coon photos there.  
Must be helluva work in cleaning the fur on this one.

Hmm.  Okay I have never seen a tail on a cat being that long? And I have had dozens of cats in my life and it has to be fake?

That step has seen better days.
Definitely regal but doesn‚Äôt make me wanna go, ‚Äúawwww‚Äù
It‚Äôs a cat. 
All that long brushed out hair will soon become a yard broom. Not all pretty cats are automatically aww material, this one didn't do it for me. Also some days, there's just more important shit going on, and for this to hold the top spot on the front page, it seems undeserved. And why are there so many bot account one liner comments?
Looks like a real asshole
