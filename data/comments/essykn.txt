She has the most fabulous mustache
Nah that‚Äôs the monopoly man
She is beautiful, and looks so healthy for that age! You must brush her often. Typically senior cats have a less healthy looking coat.
Oh she fancy.
Why do I feel like she‚Äôs judging all my life decisions but she‚Äôs about to set me straight?
I love her moustache

Bearded lady
I hope she has a Spanish accent to go along with that fabulous moustache.

I will toast this mustache with my own foam mustache later today. Here's to the Queen, may she be served well
I feel like your cat and my cat should start a mustache club.

Happy birthday, cutie!
I had a cat that passed away at 26. She was around literally my whole life basically. I was blessed to have 26 years, considering most aren't as lucky.
I hope nothing but health and happiness to your family, furry and not. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Dapper cat
Looking great for nearly 20!
Doesn't look a day older than 5!

Did you buy her a monocle?
For 20 year old her irises are remarkably clear.

Very purrty
When even a cat has a better looking mustache than you... :(
When I got married my wife she brought along her cat that she adopted. He was 10 at the time and I thought that was old. 

Now he‚Äôs 12 and still as playful as a kitten most times. He has allergies (just like his Dad, as we live in Austin). 

It always makes me so happy to see older cats like this and gives me hope we will have many more years with Mr Othello!
"It's a MAN, baby!"
I had 2 sister cats that were a mixture of this beautiful girl, one had the little white tash too! ‚ô•Ô∏è
