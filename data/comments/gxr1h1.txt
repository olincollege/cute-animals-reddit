A smile that wholesome can either mean that he's filled with love for the person filming or just farted bubbles... Possibly both.
Looks like an actual cabbage patch kid. He is adorable. Oh my goodness.
Oh man if those aren't the purest, sweetest eyes üòÉ what an adorably chubby little guy
As a pregnant woman who‚Äôs not good with words when emotional: *cries*
Holy baby fat rolls, Batman. So stinking cute.
Kid should be the new Gerber baby
[deleted]
He is just the cutest little dumpling ever.  I just love how he's got his hands placed just so. Like,  "Don't you go peeking at my bits now, you cheeky thing you."

Im not a huge fan of babies, but this chonk is so stinking cute!!
Too precious!!!
I Been on Reddit for 1 hr this morning.

AND I FINALLY SMILED!

Thanks üôè
Sooo squishy
Isn't an internet rule, to never post pics of your children?
Rolls for days so cute
As a non parent. Why do you always wash your babies in a sink? Easier to clean while you stand? Cuter? Imma guess cuter
Omg!!! What an adorable baby!!
That is the cutest smile ive ever seen!
that is literally one of the most adorable children  I have ever seen
Sweet baby Jesus. He's the epitome of cuteness with those glorious baby rolls!
He do be vibing tho
What a cutie!!!!! I just want to pick them up and hug them!
Must. Grab. Cheeks. And. Squish.
I‚Äôm not sure why, but I can totally imagine his face when he grows up! I bet this will be a cool baby photo for him to have.
He‚Äôs so happy!
Oh my goodness, this baby is the cutest!
What a cherub!
What a cutie. That smile just brightens a persons day.
So much squishy chub!!!
My first genuine smile of the day! Thank you :)
i don't know why, but posting pics of your kids on the internet is...

kinda creepy? i dunno, weird opinions i guess.
I love babies so much. But dammit, stop posting naked pictures of your children on the internet
I just audibly awwed. Thanks for this pic
So cute...enjoying the  bath
I hate to say this here but I strongly suggest you don't post photos like this online. They can and have ended up in some unsavoury places.
Please don't post naked pics of your kid on the internet. Predators also look for these. No one wants their kids pics to be peddled on the dark net by peadophiles.
yes its cute but u dont have to literally post your baby almost naked on the internet. u can downvote me but this rlly pisses me off. my opinion.

also the comments r really weird...
Yeah just post a naked picture of your kid, what could possibly go wrong
Genuinely the creepiest comment section I've ever read.
Idc I‚Äôll down vote every and all naked babies on the internet. It‚Äôs fucking weird.
Edit : cute kid tho
Look at that cute little chunk!
Wow, what an old photo from the internet.
That look of pure joy melts me!
Happy bath!! Too cute!
CUTIIIIIIIIIE
ohh so cute i love you


"I wanna hug you everytime you want me to so that you have secure attachment styles and grow up to be resilient, disciplined and a thoughtful young person"
beautiful chunky baby and a gorgeous bathroom?? come on. this is like all of my life goals right now in one pic.
Get this baby in a commercial stat!!!! So cute, and those eyes!!!!
I'm not a huge fan of babies..... but holy shit that is a cute fucking baby
Omg, well okay... you win. Your baby is the cutest in the whole world!
I‚Äôm not even a fan of babies but this one is just too adorable.
r/absoluteunits
That sweet smile melts my heart.
I don't intend to be mean but **NEVER** post photos or videos of minors on the internet there have been found reds of CP on various websites even Youtube especially in this kind of position , I would recomend you delete this post for the safety of your kid

Edit: I am  glad I'm not  the only one saying this mods should make a rule for this kind of thing and talk about this  on a pined comment don't do this in any social media ever.
[deleted]
Wtf are these comments
r/chonkers
In a few years he‚Äôs going to hate the parent that put him naked online
lol why are the top two posts in this sub pictures of black people? is this reddit's way of showing how not-racist they are? by putting pics of black people in a sub of cute animals? crazy
I could stare at the baby for hours. <3
I'm having baby fever today. This is exactly what I came for.
This is gonna be horrific in 35 years when he tries    recreating this picture.
:)
Little smush!! I love babies with fat rolls. What an adorable child!
When a kids is smiling in a bath.  Does anyone else immediately thinking you‚Äôre peeing aren‚Äôt you?
He‚Äôs so so adorable! I love how his smile reaches his eyes. What a darling :)
Contender for world‚Äôs cutest baby right here
Bro I hate children. 

Having said that, this is the most beautiful child I've ever seen in my entire life and if called upon would happily trade my own existence so that it could continue to exist.
Does anyone else ever have those realizations about just how small babies are, like every time I go to any clothing store with baby shoes it just blows my mind how we can go from so small to so big so quickly
I hope my friend doesn't see this. She will cry herself into immaculate conception.
Look at that smile!
Favorite times when chunky means cuteness to the max! I just never grew out of it!
Amid all the awful headlines.. THANK YOU for the moment of pure joy caught on "film".
What a BEAUTIFUL BABY!!!
c h u b
Cherub cheeks
My wife says he looks like a ‚Äúbeautiful chocolate waterfall‚Äù
Thats the cutest little Michelin Man I've ever seen
HIS CHEEKS
Cutest little chunk I‚Äôve ever seen!
Awww I remember when mine fitted in the sink ‚ù§Ô∏è he's 6ft now.
Can we get a human tag and animal tag? This is not what I'm here for. Babies are gross.
[removed]
This sub used to be puppies and kittens...now its cute black people. Seems kinda wrong. Replacing helpless puppies stumbling around with any pic of a black person. I think you might be getting trolled by OP
Omg. I am dying from complete cuteness overload.
Probably one of the most concerning threads I've ever gone through.

Enjoy that bath, little person!
Literally just joined this sub because of this precious baby.
The first picture his momma shows to his first significant other when they come over. 

Momma: ‚ÄúJust look how cute my baby is!‚Äù 
Kid: ‚ÄúMOOOMMMMM!‚Äù
Impossible not to smile back at this picture
Children and puppies man.  The two things on earth that have capacity for unbridled joy.  He looks so happy :)
This photo must have been taken as soon as the baby was placed in the sink. It's a precious picture. Whenever we give my grandchildren sink baths a tsunami happens immediately.

Very cute and seems happy. My parents used to wash me in a sink by a window. I was embarrassed in case anyone saw me.
This is the kind of baby you have to squeeze.
Oh my goodness those precious precious rolls!!!! That little chunky smile. Ahhh too cute
Baby and cat in the sink pictures are the cutest!

Omg he‚Äôs so adorable.
He said :)
Cute kid.  Soapy kids should not be in a vanity sink. If they drop something they might be inclined to reach for it and before you know it they are headed head first toward the floor.
Those eyes, you can tell he‚Äôs so happy. Aww.
I've never seen a baby, is that sink tiny or is the baby just big?
He‚Äôs so adorable!
Puppies, dogs, and chonky, happy babies bathed in sinks are my weaknesses...
Little big chonk
Cutie pie
