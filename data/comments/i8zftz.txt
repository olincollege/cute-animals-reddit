If you ever wonder if a baby deer has been abandoned/orphaned, look at it‚Äôs ears.

Ears upright? Fawn‚Äôs alright.
Ears are curled? Fawn‚Äôs alone in the world.

When fawns dehydrate, their ears curl quite visibly. They look sort of like little devil horns, mama will never let her baby dehydrate like that. 
So if you see that, then it‚Äôs ok to call a wildlife rescue.
That is a fresh-from-the-oven looking baby deer!  Poor little thing!  Glad mom came back :)
You are lucky you didn't get out of your car! This happened to me a couple of times, I get out to move the baby deer than bam before I know it, mama deer is in the car driving away and baby deer has fled.
The moment the mother realizes her baby is still alive is so sweet.
Her sudden glance at you is like the glare moms give when you promise their kid something they absolutely were not going to get.

Look what you‚Äôve done!
Living in the mountains you learn to get annoyed by deer. They eat all your plants, they bring ticks and fleas, they poop everywhere and obviously my dog wants to eat it, they mess up our fences from jumping them, they‚Äôre constantly hiding around corners waiting to destroy your car, they bring predators around, and all sorts of other fun stuff. BUT... those baby deer that come around in the spring are so damn cute and you never get over it.



We‚Äôve actually watched one grow up since he was a baby to now as a 4 point buck, and he‚Äôs only getting bigger. Comes around a few times a week. We named him Harry.
That's actually what fawns naturally do when facing danger, dude is just doing what it's supposed to do. Drop down and freeze. The mom is just letting it know it's safe.
*Sneezes*

Oh way to go Ron.

I sneezed! What I'm not allowed to sneeze?
So nice of the mama deer to stop the car and turn it off
I know it's the wrong movie but all I could hear the mama say in my head is, "Littlefoot. Time to get up now." - lol sorry totally lame
I have seen these insurance scam attempts before.
Continues to walk in the road instead of going back into the woods lol
And of course they continue walking down the road instead of walking off to the side. Fucking deer.
[deleted]
Omg. I love deer. This is so wholesome
...then they both proceed to stroll down the middle of the street.  No lesson was learned here, back to our standard tactics.
Some people would have just kept going, I'm glad there are people of substance in this world.
It‚Äôs a terrible day for rain
I'm glad the mama deer stopped and turned off the car, but I guess my question is why she was driving it in the first place.
Don‚Äôt worry, it will be blindsiding cars in just a few years without batting an eye.  Apparently deer get fearless as they get older.
This is so beautiful
I think this was heartwarming and thank you for sharing it ‚ù£
future winner of the Deerwin Award
Apparently it's in their nature to just drop down and hide, especially if mommy is out foraging for herself, the baby fawn will lie incredibly still for ages. My cousin ran fast through the forest as a child, tripped and flew quite some distance through the air. He had tripped on a baby fawn, and even with an 8-year-old basically kicking it and flying through the air, causing quite the ruckus, the fawn just lay there, totally frozen, even when he went to check wtf had happened
Saddest story of my life. I was driving a long a fairly busy road when the car in front of me hit a baby deer. Every one was heartbroken and the mother deer came back to get it. Was in tears
Thank you for being a good human
Great survival instinct if you‚Äôre in a meadow of long grass, not so much around humans.
the most wholesome thing i saw today
I know this is aww and I'm glad that they're okay but my brain half expected a car to come careening out and hit them
Poor baby just practicing his deer in the headlights form
We need more people like u.

Fawn. A "baby" deer is called a fawn.
r/deerarefuckingstupid
Heeeeeadliiiiiights
THARN
What the world needs now.
My heart is bleeding
I love deer theyre adorable
Might have been better to honk and scare it into reacting. I hope it doesn‚Äôt learn to do that when any car comes by it.
You are a good person for protecting them. Thank you!
üò≠‚ù§
My coworkers and I just witnessed a hawk tearing apart a baby squirrel and I showed them this to counteract the impact and it worked so thank you for this
Now I feel bad for ever driving a car!
Come, child of mine, let me save you from these cars and we shall continue our journey down the middle of the road.
Whenever I see an animal in/near the road, I flash my high-beams and honk my horn at them in hopes it'll condition them to be afraid of the road especially when vehicles are approaching.

Am I doing it wrong?
I‚Äôve seen so many reposts of this
Why can‚Äôt we look at baby/mama cows the way we look at baby/mama deer?
8 months from now the fawn will jump in front of OP's moving car because deer.
Proceeds to walk in the middle of the road
I love that the mama looks at the car like "YOU DID THIS!!"
Mom: Pssst! I'll buy you ice cream.
Looks about 5 mins old
Seems like a semi-daily occurrence on Whidbey Island, every, single, spring.
Hats off to the lovely and considerate human who waited for Mom to come to the rescue.
''it's ok son, it's just a metal speed demon''
This is very "aww," but....like....how has evolution favored their survival if that's an instinct in them?
The waddle in the end tho
"Look see,  the murdermachine stopped for you! Hurry up,  lets go before it loses its patience. They aren't all that nice. "
Dear mama
Sorry, but a little grammar lesson is called for here.

"After stopping and turning the car off to help them calm down, the mama deer cautiously came to the rescue."

This should be "After I stopped and turned the car off to help them calm down, the mama deer cautiously came to the rescue."

You see, in that first version, all the action in the sentence is referred to the mama deer. In the second version, you state what you did and then state what the mama deer did. I am sure that's what you meant.
That was oddly endearing! Cool!
Beautiful and adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è
PROTECT THEM AT ALL COST.
I'd honk at the last second :3
And naturally they start walking down the road.  Deer are assholes.

Louis C.K. has a great routine about them.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
So. Tiny.
This new Bambi sequel is great!
Please don't hit your horn!
‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ÄúRUN BAMBI!‚Äù

‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good‚Äù
And then they keep walking on the street again. Doh
You‚Äôre a good Human thank you
Really young little guy. At that age their instinct is to hide. Mamma will draw predators off so that they chase her instead of looking for the fawn. When it's safe she'll make her way back to the fawn, who ideally, is right where she left him.

Sadly millions of years of instinct don't work well with automobiles :(
Fawns are such precious things
At least he didn't end up like his brother
I came across a faun once on a river bank while fishing. They try and hide from predators this while mom lures the predator away. It‚Äôs pretty crazy seeing a faun from like 3 feet away.
So beautiful!
Precious!
Deer always look like they're tiptoeing no matter the time of day or night.
Aww. You are a good hooman ü§ó
You are a kind and thoughtful human. Thank you.
I, too, drop to the ground at any inconvenience.
It‚Äôs a new born.
That's awesome üòä
I know this is fucking terrible to say, but I thought they were gonna be run over from the other lane by someone else at the end. üòÇ
This is not a species that is trying to avoid the cruel hand of Darwin
u/tingun23
Why do deers run off in a panic when they hear a stick crack. 
But stand perfectly still when a hunk of steel Moving at 80 Km/h is head right at them?
Aaww sweet baby angel!
"no, no, no, sweety you are supposed to almost cross the road then jump back in front of the car"
Happy it was unhurt and that Mamma reappeared.
I love deer so much! ;_;
That‚Äôs wildly cute
Is this a trailer for Bambi?
He ded
Awwww ‚ô•Ô∏è
Good on you mate!
As they continue to walk down the middle of the street like the dumbasses deer are.
Poor little guy
I hate deer, but just this once I‚Äôll let the cute baby slide... poor thing.
Newborn..
The thought of mama dear watching, terrified, from the bushes :'(
Proceeds to walk in the middle of the road lmao
Damn, this is like reverse Bambi but without the sad parts
Looks like it's recently born. Deer are amazing and the most adorable
Thank you for saving its life
Little things ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww
My HEART üò≠üíó
Not too long ago saw two tiny baby deer just sort of lazily walking the road. I honked and they didn‚Äôt seem to hear. Just slowly got out of the road. I hear they can have two babies. Not sure they can hear yet.
Almost as scary as when they hear a branch snap
that‚Äôs beautiful
They are lucky you were there. Someone else might‚Äôve ran Bambi over.
üòç‚ù§
This is very touching. Hugs to the driver for stopping. I wish people would drive slower  at night too for the animals. You don't get there any quicker.
He is so tiny.  He can't be very old.
You‚Äôre a good person. Thank you.
Not sure if OP is the one in the video stopping for that baby deer, but thank you very much for stopping and letting them take their time. This was very wholesome
It has spyderlegs don't it? But cute anyway!
Poor lil guy is probably only a few hours old, if that.
oh myy so sweet ^^bambiii
So I wonder at what point they become suicidal
Poor dear glad it got across safely
Omg little tippy toes
If this is something you have done, massive respect for you OP.
Tharn.
Bless it !
Aw
I hate people who just run animals over instead of stopping.
You're a good person, take my seal of approval.
Am I the only one that gets annoyed when they don't keep filming until they disappear?
I don‚Äôt know if this works on babies (because babies are stupid) but any time I came across an animal frozen in the road, honking has worked well
Awee, poor baby... so glad mum came back for her baby
Good human
Whoa how‚Äôd the mama deer turn the car off?
This is like the polar opposite of the kodomo dragon eating the mom and the baby deer I saw on reddit yesterday.
Deer: *run 2.5 miles at the sound of one twig snapping*
Also deer: *lay down in the middle of a road when they see a car coming*
‚ÄúYou see honey, the road is a safe place :)‚Äù
Mama deer is super talented if she was able to stop the car and turn it off and *then* help her baby off the road.
Life is Beautiful.
My heart melts
Pretty sure they know a human drives the car and that's what they're actually afraid of...
This melts my heart
Ugh this is amazing. Thank you for being a good person and being patient with these beautiful creatures.
Stanky legs
*Deer get so scared crossing road one of them freezes in the middle of it*

*Deer unfreezes*

*Deer decide to start walking down scary road instead of going to safety like they had originally planned anyway*

r/deerarestupid
Aww.. she thought it died and walked towards it with hesitation... The moment she realised it is alive is so precious..
*HONK*
Straight out of bambi
Thats not a bad idea , the car might pass over him without any touch
What is the next best thing to do? GTFO? Nah let‚Äôs walk along the road slowly enjoying it.
r/DeerAreFuckingStupid

Edit: I didn't realize this was a real subreddit. I played myself.
Driving to work one morning mama deer walks across the road in front of me followed by baby deer.  The fawn gets to the double yellow line and stops.  Mama is waiting on the other side but the baby won't cross the line and is visibly stressed about it.  Finally it works up to it and JUMPS over the lines before stopping briefly to look back at them and then bolts over to mom and on their way.  It was adorable lol  If I had to guess it saw yellow and black stripes which are natures universal "Dangerous stingy bitey thing!" and freaked out but I'm no expert.  Either way it was great.
How did the mama deer turn off the car?
I was so scared they were going to get hit by a car from the other direction or something at the end. The internet and M Night Shyamalan have made me very distrustful. Happy ending! Phew.
As much as I love deer, why do their babies have such $hitty defense mechanisms?

&nbsp;

Not saying humans are much better, heck we need to be watched round the clock for the first few years, to prevent us from killing ourselves accidentally.
This is the sweetest. 

‚ÄúMooooooooom‚Äù
Deer are so fucking stupid
How did the deer turn off the car?
Dark pessimistic part of me half expected them both to be hit by oncoming car.
‚ÄúC‚Äômon Bambi, let‚Äôs have a nice stroll through the woods. What could possibly go wrong?‚Äù
Ah so they learn the invaluable skill of "freeze in the middle of the road" at a young age.
Imagine being a baby deer. 

You've spent your life so far prancing through the woods when all of a sudden BAM you come face to face with a hulking, growling, roaring beast that is spewing smoke from it's asshole and it's eyes burn like two stars.

Can't blame the poor guy for freezing.
Nice!!!
Well seeing as I‚Äôm wearing.
What a deer move to start walking up the left lane
You are a good human. Thank you.
One of the common threads across most animal species is how fucking helpless our babies are, even for those species whose babies can walk right away.

Like almost all animal moms can relate on how totally fucked their babies would be without close supervision.
Baby deer have the most useless fucking legs until they're developed.
Too cute..
Most precious animals in the whole world, I wish they weren‚Äôt so scared of us ):
Looks like these deer went to the Prometheus school of walking away from things.
OMG Bambi üò≠‚ù§Ô∏èüëèüèΩ
Awwwwwww
Awwww look at Prongs and his little Prongslet. 
Padfoot and Moony would be proud
Mother Deerest
Few weeks ago there was a bird flapping around in the middle of my lane, clearly injured. I stopped and put my hazard lights on. Guy drove up behind me, hesitated, then just drove around me and narrowly missed hitting the bird. Some people disengage their brain when they start their car.
That is a really big AWW...poor baby.  Thanks so much for stopping and knowing what happened.  I now know how to get out right away if I see this myself.  I find these creatures so graceful!
Keeps walking right in middle of road lol
Glad you stopped good job
Nature is amazing
Poor baby, glad mom came to help
Then some dick would slam his horn behind me scaring the deer if I did this.
Lol at those people eating animals while upvoting.

That's what fawns do when eating wheat in a vast wheat field grown for everyday white bread. Then the Combine Harvester machine gobbles em up and mixes em in our sandwiches.
Dat momma doe
Had to check which sub this was to make sure it was a good ending...
Oh deer
Omg I can‚Äôt take this level of feels... it‚Äôs humid, I‚Äôm menopausal, we‚Äôre cremating my ex MIL tomorrow, I‚Äôve been crying all day and now this? I‚Äôm done, I‚Äôm going to bed!
As a Call of the Wild Player, i am fighting my reflexes when watching this
I just realised a deers life sort of mirrors a zombie apocalypse they must be shit scared of everything
That was very kind and considerate of you, you made my heart happy.
Because that's what heros do
So they go walking down the middle of the streetü§¶
Shout out to the animal friendly driver, love those people!
It good human
Nice
Awwww so innocent
Poor Bambi...wait bambi lost her mom so not sure what to call this one
Mama will save you! So glad Mama came back. Hardly anything more beautiful, precious, innocent, & vulnerable as a baby deer.
Aaaaaaand now I'm crying ü•∞

Thank you for stopping. And thank you for sharing this moment.
Not a good survival tactic!
I'm simply glad you were able to stop in time and that all parties are apparently fine. Thanks

Unfortunately, fear of cars will help them survive
That baby looks about one day old.
Oh deer
Awwww this warms my heart
So teeny ü•∫
Anyone else get anxiety waiting for someone to rear-end the car?
Only a matter of time :(
Ugh, my heart.
The underrated genius had it right.

https://youtu.be/9LPpbfATqtg
You're an angel.
I'm sure that's what that momma deer is gonna say years down the road. " ...And the angel stopped the monster to wait for you to get up and leave the black river."
Stuff like this is why I have a cowcatcher on the front of my car.
/humansbeingbros
Damnit, this reminded me of when i accidentally ran over a squirrel last week. Poor little guy... And that god awful thud :(
Thanks I am now sobbing
Bambi!
Awww Bambi is safe.
Poor fawn
Gotta say I'm a big fawn of this
Mah heart. Mah soul.
How does something that's posted so many times get so many up votes? You guys never saw this? A hundred times?

Now honk the HORN!
I‚Äôm in love with the fact the deer looked at the camera almost as if it was saying ‚ÄòThe fuq did you do to my baby?‚Äô It looked so judgemental
And then they walked down the road instead of off it.... what assholes
Fawns can't run like adult deer do, and they're spotted for better camouflage, so this is their predator response. The fawn drops down and goes very still hoping to hide, and waits for mum. Mum, for her part, will start stotting (jumping around making noise and attracting attention) or even feign an injury to draw the predator away, then when the predator is far enough she believes the fawn to be safe she'll bolt and circle back around to come pick her kid up. It's not at all uncommon when hiking through whitetail country to come upon a fawn curled up just like this one was. They'll practically let you touch them before they abandon the camouflage response and try to run.
Natural instincts for both baby and mom. Fawn will drop to the ground, mom runs off to distract predator and lure them away from the baby. In a field the baby would have been hidden, but it doesn't work so well on a road.
Cute rats of the forest
Damn that‚Äôs wholesome
If you watch it backwards it‚Äôs a video of a mother murdering her baby and leaving to die
Bambi and his mom.
Cute and all but if someone plowed into that car at full speed, the person stopped in the middle of the road would be responsible. Well, maybe not wherever this is, I can't be sure.

Reminds me of [this story]

Damn! Those mama-deers do be getting smart these days. Stoped the car and calmed both a fawn and a driver before rescuing her baby. CAN SHE GET AN AMEN?

Humans shouldnt put roads in other animals territory.
He‚Äôs so tiny!
Or just go around?
Good on your for giving them time and turning your car off. üëèüèº
Poor bb ü•∫
Obv. I can't help but think of Bambi.  

Excuse me, I'm gonna to go check if it's on Disney+...
Makes me super happy you stopped and turned the car off. Poor thing was terrified, so glad she made it to safety. I really lucky I don't live near deer crossings it would break my damn heart if I hurt one. Good post!
That was actually quite faun to watch.
That little guy is gonna grow up to make a car very crumply one day.
That's really sweet, but I wish they would get out of the street.
Omg. Super-awwww!
This is why I don't speed when I'm driving. Give wildlife a brake people.
Mad respectü¶æüíØ
I, too, curl up on the ground and freeze in the middle of every dangerous (or even just slightly scary) situation.
Then it starts walking down the middle of the road like an asshole. REAL NICE DEER, REAL NICE
#**THAT'S IT JUST KEEP WALKING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD THEN.**
Aww
Mum looks at you, "don't you dare think about bambiing this shit"
Omg üò≠üò≠
SO COOT
Bambi
That‚Äòs the stuff that makes my heart really vulnerable
And continued walking on the road. Cute but deer seem to be less intelligent than most animals.
Oh man, that almost made me cry.
Omg, my heart was in my throat watching that
You‚Äôre a sweetheart!
Mom's just looking at you like, "Did *you* do this to my baby?"
Luckily no other cars came by.
They both took off trotting right down the middle of the road. Doesn‚Äôt bode well for their future.
Why not just drive around the baby deer?
Poor thing. Hope they‚Äôre okay, and good on you for stopping like you did
Not that does put a smile on my face.
What would've happen if you just picked it up and put him on the side of the road? Would you have helped? Or made things worse? (Serious question)
We are the virus.
Yup just keep walking in the middle of the road cuz you're so damn cute.
This clip is so old both those deer are dead FYI.
What this video didn‚Äôt show is the next five seconds of this car going full speed into the two of them.
I freaking thought you killed it..lol. Good job giving them the time to calm down and not letting other cars passing so it run over them.
You are awesome for how you handled this.  Well done.  I love reading about people who treat animals with respect and prevent harm.
You're a good person.
so precious --- thank you for stopping and turning off your engine----
So playing dead is inherent in their thinking?

fawn
NOOOOO lil deer
NICE RON!
Squeealllll. So cute!
aww
You are a kind person. I wish more people were this conscientious of our planet.
Rogan be bow hunting them both and keep them in his freezer for when the apocalypse comes down.

It‚Äôs entirely possible
Phone: What are you doing?

OP: Trying to capture this really touching moment

Phone: Awww. How sweet. I'm activating potato mode

OP: Nooooo. Not again!

Phone: Muahahaha
*beeping intensifies*
I thought it was ran over so I got scared and confused at why the hell this would be I  r/aww. I'm glad mom came back for the little deer :)
Ohhh this sweet baby!
why did the baby deer crossed the road?

it didn't
Good humans.
Michigan?
I just traveled through Georgia and I would always tell my codriver to look for four-legged (model) dogs.  Fortunately the few I saw either stayed on the side or quickly got across the road.  It didn't matter what time of day, they were everywhere.
aw dat baby doe
Aaaaaw ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Then another car comes...
One sniff from Mom, and "Hey you lot BACK OFF, little one is fine!"
I‚Äôm so glad baby safe. Thank goodness they stopped ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è
Oh my heart
This post makes me smile. Thank you, OP
Thank you for stopping and waiting to let mama come back, such a caring and kind thing to do. You saved a life today.
Everybody loved that
Now the baby will think it's ok to be on the road when it see cars
This happened to me when I was driving with my two daughters who are both toddlers at a time. Came down our road and a mother and fawns crossed the road right in front of us. Was only going about 15 miles an hour and I came to a complete stop, the mother and two fonds ran up the hill through the woods and one phon just collapsed right next to our car in the middle of the road. The poor thing was just looking at us and shaking in fear. Not knowing this was normal frightened behavior for a fawn, we drove past it maybe 100 feet and watched to see what would happen. Low and behold the mother came out of the woods and nodged  her baby until it got up and they scampied into the woods.
I think we should change our signs from a deer jumping to a mommy deer curled protectively around a doe.
I love how they proceed to just stroll down the middle of the road.
This is beautiful!!
Fight or Flight or Close-my-eyes-and-if-I-cant-see-it-it-cant-hurt-me
üò≠üò≠  So tiny and cute
Bless this person‚Äôs patience üíï
Just fantastic.
Oh nooo, glad you caught them in time and mama deer was able to help her little one !
Mmmm baby deer
This driver has earned my total and utter respect. You rock good sir/ma‚Äôam
That‚Äôs a fresh deer :^O
üë™
baby deer having a panic attack. poor guy/gal :(
Damn a deer in the headlights
And then they get hit by another speeding car
That was so smart and kind of you! Curious where this is?
Ooooh he real fresh
So great of mama deer she stopped and turned off the car.
I think I've seen this before, but I loved seeing it again. Good video clip!
Yeah, best to teach them that cars are nice.
Kudos to the driver for recognizing Mom needed to calm her baby!
what does it feel like to repost the same shit?
Deer are just born suicidal
I‚Äôm glad the person in the car waited for the deer to move. Some people wouldn‚Äôt do that. Keep saving those Animal‚Äôs lives.
Thank you for slowing down and waiting for them. A lot of people aren‚Äôt kind or patient,
bambi is that you ?
Dat waddle doe.
Well, that's what I do!
I know someone got laid that night.
I'm assuming that baby is only a day or 2 old? Anyone who knows what they're talking about have any ideas on how old that fawn is?
That‚Äôs unfortunate they have to do that!!! Smh

Slow THE FUCK DOWN HUUUMAN!
Of course they continue walking right up the middle of the road rather than retreating to the woods.
Deer are some fucking stupid dumbfucks.
That deer is hours old. Maybe minutes. A number of baby deer have been born in my backyard and within a few hours they stop walking like that.
My mom accidentally ran over a fawn that did this...
So glad this had a happy ending! It seldom does... Thank you, Good Samaritan. You have quick reflexes.
He is such a gift. The area where I live has been hard hit by addiction. There are a lot of these babies being born. People are afraid to parent them but they shouldn‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs only a little harder than normal and totally worth it. He inspires us daily to try harder and never give up.
Deer are hella cute<3
Damn it, there goes the perfect set up for bambi 2
Good on you, human!
My favourite animal. So beautiful.
I wonder if that was the deer that ran into my buddy's truck
Awww sweet little baby üíóü¶å glad mommy came back for encouragement
Them modifiers!

It warms my heart that you choose to stop and wait, because this was the most important thing in the world right now.  Thank you!
Karma points!!
Why am I crying
Maybe narcolepsy? You see it in little pups too!
Awe that just melts my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww! He‚Äôs so tiny!!!!
This is art. I feel the thrill watching this. One more step towards the world I dream.
Didn‚Äôt know mama deer knew how to work the ignition.
I feel bad now for hunting
How are these animals sole existence just for food? 
I mean they are adorable and all and I have never eaten one. 

But you can‚Äôt pull this shit and not be food.
AWW, This breaks my heart : (
If it dropped down like that it you arguably could have driven over it right? Not saying its a good idea, but in theory
And then they both got ran over by another car
You're not ugly crying, I'm ugly crying!
The mama deer was driving?!
AWWWWWWWW
Awwwwwwww
Be well little Bambi. I have never seen one in real life and that's why the internet gives me joy
You‚Äôre nice!
Instinct is amazing. It needs to learn a little more about concealment though.
I thought it was a reverse bambi when I scrolled onto this but it‚Äôs safe and cute, feeeeeeeewwwww
Correct and commendable action by driver.

r/humansbeingbros
You are a kind person
Beautiful
I'm just astounded the doe was driving the car, though.
It didn't 'get so scared' that's the normal reaction of deers that young
I‚Äôve seen several dead on the side of the road and one right in the middle, maybe this is why :( bc the poor things get scared and just plop down and people don‚Äôt see them :(
See! This many reasons why I like this subreddit. It helps reflect you on how precious Earth and its inhabitants are. Such beautiful things. The  Earth has so much to offer Good and Light in perfect balance. See I spread my inner Yin and Yang!
I would go grab that deer and its mother and have a threeway.
That's beautiful üòç
omg! that is so precious! God sure knew what He was doing.
Accelerate
Hurr durr look reddit I found an abandoned baby deer.  Validate me.  Gonna name him fluffy and put him in my laundry room.
repost as fuck
I‚Äôm a horrible person.
Deer are so fucking stupid. They‚Äôve killed so many people just by being giant squirrels.

Edit: lol ok.
I‚Äôd be the piece of work who would turn the car right back on just as it started standing. Get pranked
Shoulda just stepped on the gas peddle
Damit you could have got a lot of points for that one.
I would‚Äôve honk the horn lol
Five minutes later they were both hit by rifle bullets.
*honk*
Okay, all together now! AAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWW!!!!
Glad this didn't happen in China or those deers would be experts in insurance fraud.
Shoulda ran it over. ;)
