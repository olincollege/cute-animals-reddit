That snake was all about it. Also, those birds were legit having a party in that bitch.
I liked when the raccoon lifted his head and all the water dribbled out.
I want more of this.
Whoever owns/runs this should stream it on twitch! I would leave it on for hours while I work
I‚Äôm surprised it attracted a striped racer (*Masticophis lateralis* ssp.) - that makes it worth the footage by itself, even without factoring in the biodiversity shown

Really makes my heart flutter
jesus, raccoon, backwash much?
Its crazy how sketchy of a thing simply drinking water is for wild animals.  Imagine if every time you went to the fridge to grab a drink of water, there was a chance you got attacked by a predator.
Imagine having to look out for something bigger coming to eat you while just trying to get some water.
Watch [CritterVision](https://youtu.be/kLLdLn9Lpok) on youtube to see this kinda stuff 24/7 live
r/hydrohomies
The Big Bird was so tensed.... It was looking for a predator every alternate second
OP, could you post this on r/EyeBleach too? It's a sub that people go to to push out some really bad content that they see, and this is such a peaceful video that I think it's deserving of that Sub as well
Everyone politely sips and then the birds wash themselves in the water. Fine feathered friends hah.
A fountain I passed by said: "Water is for everyone. Respect it. "

Everyone but Nestl√© liked that.
How to make one of these? With the wildfires nearby, a lot of animals would be really appreciative!
0:47 - birb party!
Every animal: I will quench my thirst at this conveniently placed fountain.

The birds: splish splish splash I was takin' a bath!
Thanks! That made my day
This made me so happy
*So nourishing to watch..*
What this highlighted to me is how much animals are constantly on guard. No slow, relaxed sips. Quick sip. Look around for predators. Repeat.
One brave bird at :20
We once rented a home with a leaky hose bib.  Landlord said it would be major work to stop the leak, due to replacement of a large section of pipe, so they left it.  I stuck a large grain bowl under it, and within a month, I had 2 kinds of frogs, and a ton of animals coming to drink.  It was really a lot of fun. Don't miss the house, but I do miss the water bowl and the animals.
Damn I could watch this all day
It's the group of lil birbos for me

The first lil snek was quite cute too though
I got an old metal wash bin from a garage sale,  ordered a solar birdbath fountain from Ebay for about $15, and through in some feeder goldfish. We've enjoyed it so much, and it was cheap and easy.
I don't know why but snakes were so cute and funny. And I'm afraid of snakes.
No matter who you are, we all need water
for some reason, the snek drinking really intrigued me. ive never seen a snek drink before
Omg!!!! This is so cool

Anyone else never picture a snake drinking water before. Like obviously they do in hindsight but idk threw me off guard.

That is just super cathartic and I love it.
Best thing I've seen on Reddit in a long time
Amazing how a simple water fountain is such a wonderful source of nourishment for so many animals.
All of these animals are scared of dying the whole time they are near the water.
I‚Äôm immeasurably disappointed that this video didn‚Äôt end with an inebriated adult human drinking from the fountain.

Sweet vid tho still
Whoever made this fountain, please make available of the water  every time. 

Thank you
The raccoon drooling his water back into the bowl made my day

Other animals : i must drink for my survival 
Birds: its a party my dudes
It's so sad honestly. It's a well known spot for water among wildlife because there are very few natural places of water that is decent enough to be drinkable for animals anymore. I believe it's 50% of the natural bodies of water in this country are unsafe to drink, swim in, and fish from. Unbelievable and so heartbreaking.
I'm just glad this didn't end with "Go Vote!"
Damn it makes me sad all this karma Is going to a karma farming bot or a power tripping mod
Looks like I need to put a big bowl of water out for all the night critters. They need water too.
I enjoyed that so, so much.

How much time from beginning to end? Is this a best of a week or just a few hours?
Was not expecting to see the snake but it was pretty cool
Fantastic! :)))
I'd imagine they need it living in a desert
I don‚Äôt know why watching birds take baths is so pleasant to watch. Even when I owned birds I used to love it when they got all floofed up in their bathing bowl
That raccoon has seen some shit apparently
What if they all showed up at the same time.
Can animals smell water?
That bird at the end must be absolutely massive!
This is really great!
This was the fucking best
ngl first time seeing a snake drink water
I really thought this was going to be just raccoons, squirrels, and birds. Very impressed.
No mountain lion. I'm disappointed.

That there is just a fountain full of Cooties. 
And some cuties.
Great to see how the big part of them, don't lose their sense of the surroundings, because where is water, there will always be other animals finding it.
The little snake, holy shit that was adorable
I realize there were gaps in time, but I found it kinda crazy to see the snake, followed by the rabbit, followed by the hawk. Lol
It's my first time that i see snake drinking water
The great equalizer
Its kinda weird that none of the predators decided to camp out the water for some prey
This is awesome! Made me smile
Taking a bath in my drinking water...
Does this water taste like snake to anyone else?

It‚Äôs amazing how on edge they all are
The raccoon had to backwash didn‚Äôt he
I wonder how frequently you have to clean that thing. Considering that birds are taking splashy baths, other whole animals jump in there and others just drool into it, considering it's mostly non-moving water,  that could be a germ factory. 

Loving the video itself, though. The snake that just jumps in and takes a bath is adorable. I wonder where that was?
I‚Äôm very happy that I could identify everything in here!
I wanna drink now
Loved the bird party !!
I got all the way to the end until I realized there was sound. So I watched it over again. So worth it!
I love the bird party!

I want to live in an arid area eventually and this gives me a great idea for entertainment
Party at the lake, animal style.
It never crossed my mind that snakes would go to a water source. Very cool.
Humming birds are like the crack head energy of the animal kingdom.
Love how most of the animals are solo, being fairly careful, and then, cut to the birds, totally making themselves at home having a little bath party! üòÇ
It‚Äôs all cool til the birds start BATHING in the drinking fountains....bunch a flying jerks

Is it right to assume that this fountain becomes a hotspot for all sorts of animals? I would be surprised if various species didn‚Äôt compete for the water
they must have a schedule.
I recommend leaving something even like a bowl of water in your garden. You‚Äôll see different birds, squirrels, bees even weird bugs and it‚Äôs just nice to see them take a quick sip or even bath
oooo the Scrub Jay, very cool!!
That coyote drinks water far more daintily than my own dog...
This is so cool!

Well this thing was a hit.
Most animals: oh great! I was thirsty!

Birds and snakes: oh great! Let me wash off my filth!
This looks very California-y
Texas or Arizona?
he long boy
I don't know where that is, but I wonder if many of those animals have never seen water in a puddle like that.  Like just getting hydration from eating.
Hoping to buy a motion sensor camera of for my dad for christmas, how much are they? Photograph ones significantly cheaper than video?
Did anyone else just named all the animals while watching the video?
Hawk was quite nervous.
Makes me wanna set up a fountain for all the animal homies.

Funny that the wariest customer is the most alpha predator.
Anyone know what that blue bird at the end is called? It‚Äôs so cute!!
No ppl
How cool. Glad i did not witness a predator getting a prey
In the desert, I‚Äôve had all these animals, including falcons and road runners :) I recommend everyone try this.
It's weird they're all so different and some are predatory towards others but they all have the basic need of thirst in common.

Birds are so selfish. All the other animals used it as a water fountain whereas the birds are bathing in it. Birds suck!
I keep a large bowl of water and put down fresh birdseed on my porch every day. I love watching all the different critters pop buy for a snack and a sip.
Made me smile-thanks!
Showaa partyyy!
All the algorithms know,  I love a bird splashing in a water fountain.

ELI5 why these animals/animals in general don't get sick from sharing the same water source?
I love how some of the animals look around before taking a drink. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre saying ‚Äúnah, let me look around because ain‚Äôt nobody about to run up on me while I take this swig of aqua‚Äù
Wait till they find about corona

All those animals were on high alert. They were all like "This sweet ass fountain has to be a bait, right?"
This is so kind of you to have out there! I love you stranger!!!!
This is awesone. Where is this located? Looks like a dry area. I keep a bird bath in my property, but I need something like this now.
Oh wow

How do they keep that fountain so clean? I had a bird bath for a while and it got filthy so fast even with a fountain.

Someone needs to add the Harlem shake drop at 0:46 and post it for free internet points
This reminded me of the elementary school logic problem. You have the chicken, the fox, and the bag of feed and you need to cross a river...

It is a good thing that many of these animals visited on separate occasions.
That made my day!!! Thank you!!!
Blew my mind when I learned dogs and cats (and others) lap up water using the UNDER side of their tongues
yes Water quentches taste, thats wanderful. keep posting I like it and I will share this video too
Bird saw the snake like "ah sh*t, nevermind"
Fascinating how nearly every animal is on high alert
Humans invaded and took over most of their natural habitat. It should be our duty to provide them with the same food and water resources they once had, even if not natural.
Plot Twist: It's actually a potion that changes the animal into another animal
All the animals were like ‚Äúclean fresh drinking water, this is great!‚Äù  Then the birds just hop in and clean their asses in it.
This is incredible.
Bird behind the snake: I'm in danger.

Amazing. Gotta watch more cute animal vids after this.
Obviously I'm being dumb... But is it OK that a snake drank from that? I assume that they don't just release poison all the time (if it is a poisonous snake.)

This is wonderful, just what I needed. I had a water feature in my backyard that led onto a tide pool and pond (manufactured), and it was the most relaxing thing to sit quietly and watch the animals come for shade and drink. I‚Äôve missed that so much lately and this brought a bit of that back.
One - has rabies. All - have rabies.
This reminds me of Warzone
Really enjoyed this video, now I need a water feature lol..
I love the different approaches the birds have. The hawk looking boy is ON HIGH ALERT while fluff balls are just like BATH TIME YAY
That is so cool! Is there a livestream link?
Was that a honey badger?
Makes me happy seeing all them drink
crazy how most animals are so cautious when drinking water.. especially that eagle, he was the most anxious alongside the raccoon.
Hawk and humming bird are so cautious. Blue Jay don‚Äôt give a shit
I recommend at least watching the last 10 seconds if you don't wanna watch the full thing

Oh my goodness, the first snake, the rabbit, and the hawk drinking water are the cutest things ever! They're all cute, but those really stuck out to me.

Oddly I thought the snake was the cutest getting his little sippy sips.
I know it‚Äôs not true, but watching the video, I liked to think that this water fountain was an unspoken, mutually agreed upon safe space for all animals.  They can all go and drink/bathe, and no hawks will be attacking the bunny/snake eating birbs/ etc :‚Äô)
I have never heard the sound a snake makes when it drinks water and now I‚Äôm extremely happy that I have.

Precious. Thank you.  Everybody needs pure/clean water.
Having sound on this is so rare/fantastic
Trash panda
Best part of living in the sticks!
I knew there'd be a bird party at some point.  :)
I love this!  Thank you for posting.
Isn‚Äôt this how chronic wasting disease spreads. Kinda makes me uncomfortable
I could watch this all day
 Omg the snake is so.m cute
Unexpected noodle
You call that a fountain?
Bunny ü•∫
Looks like somewhere in the desert... but maybe its just the coyotes and snakes that remind me of home.
the raccoon didn't even drink ...
Okay i want that fountain
Everyone else : "Phew! I finally found water!"

Birds : laughs "drink my bathing water bitches!"
couldnt there be an eventual viral or bacterial infection spread cross-species over a short period of time with a small contained body of water like this?
r/hydrohomies approved content!
I love it when birds bathe. They are just too stinkin adorable!
I was waiting for a bobcat or lion to show up
Is this the greatest thing in the world?
So cute
Plz post more In the future. I love this
Oh but when I try to take a sip there‚Äôs a problemü§®üôÑ
This might be the best video I've ever seen
Man birds love fucking stuff up
This legit made my day.
r/gifsthatkeepongoing
Birds are like "see that coyote drinking from that fountain? I washed my balls in that fountain."
Please I need more!!
All those birds taking a bath made my day :)
The little snek lapping water ‚ù§Ô∏è
The whole thing was great but I loved that wild bird party at the end.
Nice how many animals you can help with that.
Is that a Red tailed hawk?
That snake was in paradise
Water is life
Made me smile
That bird at the end was like ‚ÄúYou saw nothing.‚Äù
Where is this? What's the circle thing in the middle? This is so cute and so needed
I want more of this.
This is my most favorite thing ever found on reddit. Its official. üèÖ
A lot of these animals are lucky they missed the other animals while they were at the fountain! That snake looked about big enough to eat that rabbit. So did the hawk.
It's kinda crazy to think about how many little creatures have been helped out by just this one water fountain.
I could watch that all day long!! Need to have a live cam set on that to enjoy!  Thank you for this wonderful share!
Those snakes were adorable
The snake is so cute
Watching this it occurred to me that I never thought snakes could drink.
Daaamnnnnn that's a lot of awards
Racoon looking SUS.
Cutest video
Even a friendly snek stoped by.
Birbs!!!
It‚Äôs soooo cute when there are a couple of sparrows (or other small birds) drinking and hopping <3
Watching with sound makes it 100x better and it was already 10/10!
That's wonderful. It must be very satisfying for the owner as well as the thirsty critters.
Now all of them at once!
I thought the snake was about to pop out and fuck up that bunny...
Stay hidrataded guys and girls
Hawk: *Carfulies takes sip while staying on Guard.*   
Hummingbird: *Carefully dives for sip while making sure not to fall in.*   
Small Flack: *Party in Miami*   
Jay: **WAAAAAAGH!**
Sneck go glip glip glip
If you have pets who also drink from that bowl, get them vaccinated for leptospirosis.
I wish to be as refreshed as you know those snakes are. And as carefree as the birds in the bird party. I think everyone wishes they could be in that bird party
well that is just adorable
I wanted this to never end
Thanks for sharing, that 1 minute of nature was very relaxing!
Wait there‚Äôs something missing here. What moved the center fountain?
That pool party killed me.
How big is that last bird? It took like a whole fountain.
Whereabouts is this on the earth?
Just realized I've never seen a snake take a drink before...
I love when birds cover themselves in water just by flailing wildly.
Like an other user here said, I absolutely love the sparrow spring break ‚ù§Ô∏èüíú‚ô•Ô∏è
ok but where can i watch more videos like this? i didn‚Äôt know i liked it until i did. it‚Äôs so calming
I have three of these set up around my house. I should get a camera for one of them.
Isn‚Äôt this one human a drinking the bowl away from creating the next virus?
That first bird being like all cautious then cue in to that bird that dgaf and brings its whole family and friend inside then one just taking a bath.
Lmao the bluejay at the end "I LOVE THIS FOUNTAIN, ALSO FUCK THIS FOUNTAIN"
What's the animal right after the skunk?
‚ÄúLife, uh...finds a way.‚Äù
That bird party at the end looked pretty dope
Majestic

Broken food chain
Little sneks
I need to do this
Beautiful üòç The snakes surprised me üêç
This was delightful
Water Unites us all :')
Aww, the snek that went for a swim
I was waiting for a t-rex to come out.
Someone needs to make a channel on this 24/7.
Can they get rabies from drinking from the same fountain?
Thank you. This video made my night
Plot twist it's posion
Based on my extensive research watching various talking animals interact with each other, the proper term for this is ‚Äúwatering hole‚Äù
I've got a dog that drinks like that rabbit, takes her so long. Other dogs stick their face in the water gurgle down and run off.
It is scientifically proven that this video reduce stress by over 34%
How delightful. Could watch this all day.
This would make a great animated short.
Zootopia
What a nice video!
That danger noodle was really long !!
They all drink while watching out for other animals
Cute!!!!
Southern California?
