Man I watched this way too many times.
"DEPLOY EARS!"

"EARS DEPLOYED, CAPTAIN!"
This dog was born with a horrible rare condition that makes him deaf for li- oh wait never mind 
Noisy gifs.


Pop. Pop.
I saw a gif of a hedgehog stuck inside that same pillow the other day.  Croissant pillows are karma gold.

Here he is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwkssMvB8c0

"Smell sensory activity detected sir!"

"Deploy ears for audio scan"

*boing... boing...*

"Ears deployed sir!  Scanning!" 
What breed of dog is that?
Doo Nn Do Do
I also become errect while being teased. 
Many years ago there was a commercial for the Sega Genesis game "Wolverine: Adamantium Rage." The commercial had a way-too-serious 90's narrator who said "Hear the sound-" and then there was a "Snikt!" sound, and he continued with "adamantium claws make-'" "Snikt!" "-when they extract their revenge!" 

I would watch TV with my cat on my chest, and when the commercial came on, I would tuck back his ears (gently) and as the commercial made the "snikt!" sound I would release one ear, then the other. It delighted my young teen mind to no end. Suffice it to say this doggo brought that memory back to the forefront. :)

Thank you for reading this story about fading childhood memories.

I never realize how closely these guys resemble seals when you can't see their ears 
This made me happy in a way that is indescribable 
Much ears. Such cute!
Why is your dog being cuddled by a pumpkin? Lovely dog xx
Oh my gosh this is the cutest thing I've seen all month!

I sat here for 10 full minutes making different sound effects for the ears. Pop pop, pew pew, boing boing. Endless entertainment (for ten minutes).
