Enjoy your new litter.
I can't believe a parent would sacrifice their daughter to feed shelter puppies, but I guess it must be done. At least she seemed to be happy in her last moments. 
Talking from experience a pack of puppies can and will take down an adult.

LPT: do NOT crouch down around large groups of pups,  you will inevitably end up on the ground with noses and tongues in more places than you can defend. It is the most adorable hell I have experienced. 
"She has the key! Get her!"
That child is radiating happiness. 

You're a horrible parent if you don't print this, frame it, and put it up on a wall somewhere to look at for the next fifty years.
Can I volunteer there too?
Well, now you have to adopt all of them now. She is the Queen of their pride!
Thanks OP for making my day happier today
Does anyone else see the face made of blankets on the left

Wait, there is a person at dog shelters that just feeds puppies... How do I turn that into a self-sustaining career?
I'm a full grown woman and I couldn't withstand the force of all that cuteness.  

Your daughter is a beautiful child.
You should have said "overpupered"
That is just way too adorable, I especially like the one who looks like he's trying to hide behind her.
Oh my god that would be the happiest experience of my life.
Nothing is more joyous in life than being taken down to the ground by a pack of rabidly affectionate puppies.

Its just a cacophony of noses and tongues and paws and ears and it's the best thing ever
This is how I want to die.

Her reaction says it all. What a nice picture of puppy loving kid and a happy one.
if you've ever experienced a puppy swarm then you know the answer to whether to fight 100 chicken sized horses or 1 horse sized chicken
Just rescued a 3month pittbul mix and can confirm if they want your face they will get it. Adorable.
Drowning in cute puppies. This is how I want to go. 
It's amazing, our bond between dogs and humans. 
Made my day.
Do you want a puppy? Cause this is how you get a puppy.
What a way to die. 
That should be the cover of your Christmas cards! Absolutely precious and priceless!!!! 
The puppies fed well this day.
The last thing you heard was her laughter and the yelps from the puppies. She was never seen again as the puppies dragged her away to play with her for ever and ever. 
7 adorable pups, 1 adorable girl. The adorable factor is overwhelming. 
Next week on The Barking Dead...
Feed some humans to the puppers? It is a truly unusual population control method.

Can't remember the last time I've experienced pure joy like that

This is how I want to die
Why can't I feel the way I should about this image after watching Stanger Things season 2?
A noble death.
Em I the only one to see a face in the blanket? 
a basket of adorables?
RIP.. Rest in puppies
And puppies have that good puppy smell
This is the most pure thing I've ever seen üíó
Best job ever. 
That's her best day ever.

Future vet right there.
This needs a black and white ‚ÄúWASTED‚Äù overlay 
Completely doomed. No hope, especially if that bottom pup joins in.

On a serious note, as an animal lover, thank you for introducing your kiddo to helping animals at an early age. <3

Cute...but I was told children can't volunteer until much older, at the very least 10, and even that's not typical. I asked somewhere online how old you could be because I wanted to see if my 7, almost 8 year old, could do that (with one of his parents of course) and was told no he couldn't and literally verbally attacked by like 2 people for even considering it. It was bizarre to say the least but my point is I didn't think young children could volunteer there...
She volunteered or did you volunteer her? 
/r/peoplefuckingdying
r/peoplefuckingdying
Out of curiosity, if you happen to see this comment, how did you get your daughter interested in charity? I just had a son, and I‚Äôd love to imagine one day he could be so sweet.
That's how they get you: adorableness.
Rabid pack of hounds smother defenseless child.
this picture is too wholesome, I love you OP. 
That shelter has a lot of puppies!

Maybe it‚Äôs just the city I‚Äôm in now, but if there is a puppy available, they are gone in a day.
Yo, those puppies make me want to photo crop a bunch of gangster glasses on all the puppies so everyone can see thug life can be cute.
Please tell me there's video....
Death by puppy. 
If I was going to die, being taken down by a pack of puppies doesn't sound to bad. 
/r/peoplefuckingdying would love this
That's so awesome. I didn't learn until I was 23 that I enjoyed volunteering at a shelter until the court ordered me to.
That expression though. Got it Right. 
Meanwhile the towel gets grumpier.
/r/PeopleFuckingDying
If that doesn't out a smile on your face nothing will.
Every kid needs to experience this, damn. Its like 100% pure happiness. Kid is happy, puppies are happy, absolutely guarantee whoever took the picture is cheesing something crazy. Too much joy in one pic.
And then she got pooped on 5 times but didn't care because it was worth it. 
This is how I want to die. 
Off topic, but I wonder if those boots are available in adult sizes because they're really cute.
/r/peoplefuckingdying
Assuming you now have 7 new children in your house?
I hope you took all of them home. No way they can be separated ever again. 
I mean if you have to go this is probably the preferred method. 
So cute! I love how their tails are all fuzzy. There‚Äôs a whole lotta wagging going on there?   
Well I‚Äôm jealous...
OMG. Very cute
That's how I want to go. 
I can watch this all day 
Everything is perfect here, I hope my day will too

This is the most heartwarming thing I've seen in a long time really made me smile... thank you! Make sure you treasure this photo of her pure happiness!
Almost fooled me into thinking you helped out a homeless shelter, but then I remembered ew homeless people.
So cute girl and dogs
The puppy hiding behind her lol you can‚Äôt see me. 
sadly now, there can be but one outcome...
##JOY##
Good luck not leaving without a puppy!
I can not ever go into a shelter. That would be 7 new puppies for me. 
The real question here is how many of those puppies did you leave with?
No way I could do this, I‚Äôd leave with 7 puppies.
Well...sometimes children have to be sacrificed for survival of the human race. Her gain was not in vain. She (and yourself) are greatly awwwwwwed for it. #neverforget #puppylove #adopt
Been there I love my golden she was in a litter of 9 which stayed at my house while my aunt was visiting (picked a good time to visit family) our garage door is still demolished with puppy scratches 
RiP in pieces OP's daughter
someday i wanna be that happy

Puppies are absolutely ruthless with their adorableness.  No mercy.
You fed her to puppies?! What kinda parent are you?
Getting affection like this at this stage of a puppies life can make such a difference in a dogs development.  I know shelter workers do their best but are often so busy.  This makes me so happy to see. 
I kind of feel like all wars could be stopped by puppy bull rush of love! 
Be mad with a bunch of adorable fucking puppies bull rushing you for love an attention! No one is that far gone!
Cute
god damnit thats too cute for a man 
I hope she's aware that after this moment the rest of life will be a pale disappointment, where she ambles along trying to replicate the feeling of her first puppy ambush. 
rip
I love that you can see their tails blurred in excited wagging. 
Aww, what a sweet little princess :)

Much better than my cousins who scream at dogs =_=
Death by puppies

RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!!! ITS THE PUPPY APOCALYPSE!!!!! ALL IS LOST!!!!! ALL HOPE IS LOST TO THE ADORABLENESS!!!!!!!
For a split second after opening this, I thought she was crying. That would have been awful, lol.

Glad she enjoyed the puppies!
So this brings a couple questions to mind:  Is it once a week or a couple days a week?  And is she trying to figure out ways to make it all day every day?
CHiLd eaTeN ALIve by RaBId DoGs 
Having a bunch of puppies crawl on me is on my bucket list.
As someone who has volunteered at a shelter I can tell you that it probably reeked like shit in that kennel. Puppies are insanely cute in pictures but not when you have to deal with the never ending amount of shit they produce.
That is what heaven looks like!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is adorable but how is she allowed to volunteer there? Every shelter I‚Äôve ever been to only allows 18 and older volunteers. 
Just keep an eye on her. Puppies have very sharp teeth and don't know how to behave like adults... Cute does not equal safe, unless you're in a Disney movie.
Great memories of the ultimate first job being made right their,thanks for sharing.
My favourite part is the Road Runner stuffy.
Ahhh I see why the shelters in my area won't rehome dogs with families with children under 12 years old.......too much cutenesswill ensue

You could make a fortune bringing a room full of puppies to a corporate site and charging people to be attacked by said puppies.

That one puppy in the bottom left seems to be even more smothered than the little girl.
Thank you OP. I'm so pissed off with my local asshole bus driver and this pic made me feel calmer.
Those puppies have to get adopted.  Even more after this pic.
Oh, the humanity!
O gosh that is so heartwarming and uplifting. Thank you for sharing the joy!!!
most happiest moment. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•

Please adopt the one on her right tucked right behind her!!!
Just leave her...there is nothing you can do but live on
It's such a great idea to take your kid volunteering with you! When my little one is old enough I think we'll set something up for each month so he gets the experience. It's important for kids' development and for the community. 
Perfection.

Incidentally, is that one at the bottom peeing on her?
Those are pitbulls right?
They look like Pit Bull puppies! 
I don't think I have ever been this happy before. I envy this little girl.
That puppy's nose in the back is getting squished lol
As a 30 year old dad.... I can honestly say I envy your little girl. I would love to be mauled by a swarm of puppies even now.
Puppy on the bottom appears to have mistakened her shoe for a fire hydrant.
And you took  a picture instead of video... BAD PARENT. No cookie for you!
Are those boxers with tails? I had one when I was younger, so I have huge soft spot for them.

Aww! I inquired if we can do this at one of our local shelters, but apparently they don't allow kids under 10 to be in contact with the puppies or dogs as volunteers. I was like "but... socialization".... Nope. Not allowed. Needless to say, we were a bit bummed. I'm glad you and your daughter got to have this experience!
I would like to switch places with this girl please. 
And now you guys have seven puppies? (I love this subreddit‚Äîshows up with supercutness right when I need it.)

Do you want Weredog kids? Because this is how you get Weredog kids. 
I'd tap that!
My local shelter wouldn't let me even touch the pups or kitties they had when they learned i was 17. 

I would've signed any and all papers to get clearance to, as would have my parents. I ended up doing office work for them for about six months, then my schedule changed and I couldn't help at all.  

I've been salty since. 
I'm not crying, you're crying!

hard to tell who is having a better time, her or the puppies.
Oh my gosh!!

My parents never let us have a dog even though I always wanted one (they both grew up on farms, we lived in the suburbs, they weren't into keeping a dog in a garden all day).

My friend (also neighbour) was getting a puppy and they knew how much I loved dogs, so they brought me with them when they went to pick up the puppy to bring home.

I was taken down by a litter of lab puppies and could not have been happier about it.
Great pic! This made my day.

This is a memory that will stick with her for life. I had a golden retriever give birth to a litter of puppies when I was somewhere close to her age, and I still remember the overwhelming cuteness/joy/happiness from when all those puppies ran and piled on me the first time. It may be my first real memory I have so it feels like the cuteness actually kickstarted my consciousness. 
It appears that all involved had a great time.
This reminds me of the time I was a camp counselor for rising kindergarteners and one of them said ‚Äúattack the teacher!‚Äù And I got swarmed and tackled

Volunteering at an animal shelter is a rewarding experience. You see those sad dogs experience some happiness for a little bit each day. You get to love on puppies. The sad part is leaving them at the end of the day without their forever home.

Well, it's obvious why your daughter is volunteering! Good for her. Great for the puppies. 
You didn‚Äôt leave any behind did you? Given that they clearly chose to adopt your daughter. Is fine. They don‚Äôt get much bigger than that...
Not trying to poop on the parade, but be aware of the risk of them transmitting worms to your daughter. If she starts scratching her butt a lot she might have them. It's not a big deal, easily treatable, but rather gross. A friend had it happen to their little son.
Aww
They're all coordinating! So cute!
I wish I'll have a kid as great as that. You're lucky parents hehehe, coming from a teenager too hahaha!
I feel like this is one of those moments that little girl will remember for the rest of her life. Pretty amazing to think about that. 
She will always cherish looking at this moment. Pure joy! (In the digital age I fear many pics will be lost over time.)

That's my dream.
Humans and dogs are hardwired to love each other. Dogs that were attentive to their humans were better fed and passed on their genes. Similarly, humans that cooperated with domesticated dogs survived better and were able to live long enough to pass on their genes. 

We evolved to love each other.
This is so cute üòç xx

This may be "cute," but allowing a dog to lick the face of a child is dangerous not only from a hygienic point of view (bacteria, viruses, parasites), but also from a behavioral one.  Dogs lick to assert dominance (or attempt to) and to garner attention from humans (they rarely lick other dogs; rather, they sniff butts.) It's not much of a stretch from licking to nipping to actual biting. More to the point, if you've any experience with dogs whatsoever, you're more than aware of what *else* they lick/eat with those mouths. 

If you must, allow the dog to lick your hand or ear -- then wash it immediately thereafter. Please don't encourage this sort of behavior in either your dog *or* your child.
