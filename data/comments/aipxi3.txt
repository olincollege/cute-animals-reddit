Wait this made me think, what do firefighter dogs actually do? I know the used to run in front of wagons to warn people to get tf out of the way but what do they do now??
It sounds like they want to train him to be an Arson Detection Dog.

He needs a super hero name to go with his origin story. I'm proposing Barkdraft.
This made my heart explode with happiness!! I bet he is a great firefighter!! üëçüèªüíïüíó
Poor little guy but he looks so proud all grown up. 
Strange, I'd imagine the poor pup would be scared of fire after that.

Oh shit he‚Äôs probably immune to fire now
You were merely raised in the fire. I was born in it, molded by it.
i am the dog, once victim, me

burned in a fire, so horribly

saved by the firefighter friends,

my life spared by what fortune sends

n as i heard once in a song -

'*what doesn't kill you makes you strong* . . .'

n so i choose to others save 

Fire Fighting Dog -

am Very *Brave*

Ah yes from the proverb, ‚ÄúHaving been booped, I must boop‚Äù 
Real life anime protagonist 
The fire took everything from him: his family, his home and his confidence. He will forever carry the scars the flames gave him on that fateful day, but he will never forgive them. His desire for vengeance, to right the wrongs this awful force commits, overwhelms him. Today he runs along like-minded folk, working toward the same cause, but none carry quite the same reasoning. For the dog... The dog craves REVENGE.

Pretty sure everyone at that fire department loves that dog fiercely.

I'm not crying! You're crying!
He's a really really good boy
HE LOOKS SO HECKIN PROUD OF HIMSELF!!!!!
New member of paw patrol?
he looks very serious. 
Favorite thing I saw today! 
What breed is he? He's absolutely gorgeous!
That short hair means doggo cant be furloughed. 
I‚Äôd give up people in my life for him 
Good mother fucking boy right there
Voluntarily? How? How would he know about human activities and professions?!
Do he bite the fire?
People who bitch about this dog "running into burning homes he has PTSD" they're not going to send a living creature in to a dangerous situation, fire dogs are primarily used as emotional support,  his job is to love and be loved, it is possible he's a search and rescue dog, but that's not going to be search and rescue in a burning house. Firefighters risk their lives to save strangers dogs do you really believe they're going to let *their* dog into danger? Jesus.
OMG! That's soooooooo pretty !!!!
his face at the bottom right is so goofy in the best way possible! Good boy!!!
He becomes a VERY good boy!
What a wonderful dog and story.
So cute! Tough little pup! 
Adorable
This just says that anyone can do anything. That dog is not a dalmation and was injured at the start of his life, but now a hero that saves other people's lives. 
The hero that we need.
Holy fuck that made me cry
That poor thing. Glad he‚Äôs ok now
Awww
[r/dogswithjobs](reddit.com/r/dogswithjobs) 
Wait. So some firefighters found a dog, saved it from a fire, and stole it from the dogs owners?!?
Uhm is it just me or is that kind of awkward? Like commemorating Jesus with a cross. "Hey Dave you know that Puppy we saved from a burning house? I have an idea, hear me out - "
UHTENN..hut ... EYYZ..front ... EARS..back.

Ready for inspection.
Nice way to retraumatise him 
He looks like he‚Äôs so proud of himself in that last picture. 
Fire pupper! üòç
Wouldn‚Äôt he have trauma from the initial fire though? I wouldn‚Äôt expect dogs to have that some thought process of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this so others don‚Äôt have to suffer it.‚Äù 
I mean, this is cool at all. But imagine you're a living being that doesn't understand human language. You get burnt to a crips because of a fire... then humans give you a job that puts you near fire. 

Sounds a little traumatizing. Hopefully they just have that pup hang out at the fire stations and not helping with the fires. 
anyone else think this is a little mean? he could have like, puppy ptsd
I wish I could upvote this more than once

Did they crop his ears? Please tell me they are just tucked back....
He looks like the goodest boy omg his badge and vest, I CANT!
This sub is toxic as fuck. There is literally not a single picture that at least 30% of you won't bitterly complain about. Unbelievable. 
Somebody thank this boy for his service! 
You guys and chopping onions in here.
Wow I can't believe he decided to become a firefighter after that.
This is the department I work for. Will confirm he is a sweet puppers. 
wouldn't it be traumatic for the dog to go back to fires???
Imagine having to relive the worst day of your life again and again.
That sounds uplifting, except the dog didn‚Äôt choose to be a firefighter. It‚Äôs the humans that are forcing him to relive his nightmare experience over and over.
‚ÄúYou merely adopted the fire, I was born in it. Moulded by it.‚Äù
"You merely adopted the fire. I was born in it, molded by it."
Could anyone please care to elaborate what's all the fuss about fire fighters in the U.S.?
I know this is not the adequate subreddit for this question, but if you don't mind?
I'm from Europe and for us their job is sure important, but we don't glorify them.
So I don't understand why Americans do that?
what a beautiful boye!

he looks so proud!
What happened to his original owners tho?
So... you're putting him back in to the most traumatic time of his life, night after night?
But wait. Where did the scar on his head come from that is visible on pics 2 & 3?  Doesn't look like it was related to his original injuries
Now THATS a good boy

Is there no trauma or ptsd instilled into dogs that suffer stuff like that?
Now the dog gets to relive the trauma every time theres a fire
Hims a handsome boy! Yes hims is! Edit: B. Lindler... If you are the firefighter that rescued this doggo, you're my fucking hero, too.

They might not bring him near any fires as a support doggy, but I wonder if the smell of fire would evoke anything? Apparently not, since this looks like a good dog. 
You merely adopted the fire. I was born in it. Molded by it.
He linked the flame
Let me guess, his name is ‚ÄúSparky‚Äù. üòä
Great way to decompress after seeing terrible shit and gives a dog a good home. Fire departments should make this a standard.

I think we all can be proud of that good boi .. Pitbulls are quite fearless i have two myself and my oldest whos ten now has amazed me with how loyale to a fault he is. .I could definetly see a pitbull raised by fire fighters would be eager to help in anyway if trained properly.They can and have proven to be good working dogs!
I love Pitbulls.
Pits really are the toughest sweethearts.
Is that the same pup in both pictures? The one with wounds on his back doesn't have facial scars.

Well this doggo deserves extra the treats and belly rubs. 
Give this upvote!!
Cute. Take an upvote cause this reminds me of AOT
Yeah im sure he 'chose' his profession.
Do people in this thread actually think this dog is LITERALLY fighting fires? What is the department doing? Strapping a hose to his back and sending him into the building?

I LOVE thissss!!!!‚ù§Ô∏è So, is he adopted by all the other firefighters or does he go home with someone?üòÅ
W o r k i n g B o y e 
WTF, did he ask to become a firefighter?
How does this work? Did his family donate him to the fire department? Does he still live with his family and still attend training/shifts? Is his family not ok (physically or financially) and the fire department adopted him?
He has scars.. Poor doggo
‚ÄúThx for saving me from fire‚Äù

Pitbulls are fighter dogs... firefighter dogs
The great pitty of FIRE
Imagine almost dying in a fire and then every day you go to work trying not to die in fires. 
Wait a goddamned minute. 

Did the dog ASK to be continually put back into this situation? 

Commenting before reading the thread, as is the way of the internet, so I‚Äôm prepared to be schooled...
Its cute and all but I think they didn't think critically. 
Exposing a dog to fire who was traumatized by fire (especially when a pup) is not smart. The dog needs to be away from fire. He doesn't look too happy as an adult dog. This is honestly sad in my opinion. 

Of course hes a pitbull. The best dogs always are 
This is kinda fucked up. What if that good boy has some serious doggy-PTSD around fires?
Handsome good boye
Ironic: he could save others from fire ... and also be saved himself?

Sorry, that doesn't work.
Such a good pup! ‚ù§
Pits are the smartest dog you can get
Oh no it's a pitbull everyone be scared now. Scariest breed ever. Hahaha people are dumb sometimes.
Thats too adorable
Someone needs to make a movie about this
Imagin if he dies to a fire

I hope they didn't actually have him go back into fires to save people.

Usually traumatic experiences for dogs follows them later on
Probably be downvoted but why do the last two pictures shows serious scars on his head but the first picture shows no signs of a head wound?
Bad ass dog
This is kind of fucked up. That dog is probably emotionally traumatized by the fire. Who decided that the best course of action is to make him keep interacting with them? Obviously the dog didn't tell anyone this was what it wanted. Someone just thought it'd make a great "overcoming" story, but that seems like a really selfish decision for an owner to make for a dog that's been through that.
