I think they both found the right one to be with. That kitty is going to get a lot of love and affection I‚Äôm guessing
I'm very sorry for asking but is his condition medical or from an accident, my curiosity outweighs my politeness so again I am sorry.
I don‚Äôt know how to give an award with a message so I gave you the bear and I‚Äôll say this
AWWWWWW
Get up on out of here with my eyeholes! This is great though
There‚Äôs this pervasive idea that scarring/trauma makes you less beautiful, but he seems perfectly beautiful to me. It‚Äôs like that Roald Dahl poem about what makes someone beautiful, where he says someone with beautiful thoughts will always look lovely. This entire picture is lit up from the love this guy has for his cat, and his smile is completely genuine. Both he and the cat look absolutely perfect to me. I‚Äôve honestly never before seen anything with that same quality. 

The poem, for reference:

"If a person has ugly thoughts, it begins to show on the face. And when that person has ugly thoughts every day, every week, every year, the face gets uglier and uglier until you can hardly bear to look at it.

A person who has good thoughts cannot ever be ugly. You can have a wonky nose and a crooked mouth and a double chin and stick-out teeth, but if you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.‚Äù
Very cool! And sweet :)
I just cut 2 finger off and laying in er panicked. Realising what this guy must have gone through with that injury.... Damn. Just inspired me
Out of curiosity, what happened to each of them? it's ok if you don't want to answer. I'm fine with just having a wholesome post : )
A soulmate for you both!!!!
Omg my heart is full for this photo of you two!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

We had a cat named Phoebe that looks very similar to this kitty, but her missing eye was the other one.

She was SOOOO cuddly all the time.
Beautiful
He looks so genuinely happy :')
Aww so sweetüòäWishing many years together for you guys!!!!
He looks so happy!
This is so beautiful! I'm glad they both found each other :)
This man might have lost his eyes but he still has his sight for life ... stay up friend glad you got a little kitty to share life with
The cat is weary but very happy at the same time. And the guy is just pure happiness, look at that smile!! Great match I'd say.
Omg that smile on that man ... he is about to give that cat the world! I love it
Eye see what you did there
Awww i love them both
So sweet!!
Sometimes when you stop looking for love, that‚Äôs when you find it.
I love the number of smilies and hearts and exclamation marks in the replies. 

Your husband is a survivor, great picture. üëç
That kitty's missing the same eye as me
Was it love at first sight?!
my first reaction was "holy shit that guy must be SO allergic to cats" then i realized he didn't have any eyeballs.
AWWsome photo!
Not yet !
This makes my day
Reminds me of eyehole cereal from rick and morty
I imagine the man has been thru a lot because of his face and the fact that he still has a smile better than me is truly awesome.
Eye believe in a thing called love!
I love this. Beautiful picture, captured a moment.
All I see is two pirates buddies about to rock the seven seas
Very cute, the cat is OK too I guess

if there even is a holloween then they should dress up as pirates
I hope you‚Äôre both happy with each other!

My cat just sits and blinks at me. Usually there‚Äôs hunger involved.
Whats his story?
was it wrong for me to think it was a faceswap gone wrong for a sec?
the wholesomeness
Wtf. People are such assholes.
Going to need some context here
That's the great thing about pets. They don't care how you look or anything. As long as you treat them well and love them they will love you no matter what!
That smile is so pure! I'm happy for them both :')
This pic made me day
Best picture on the internet.
I love this.
This is the sweetest thing I've seen on Reddit.
SO sweet!
Oh I love it!!
Wow. Can I ask what happened to the dude or was he just born that way?
This somehow reminds me of Toothless and Hiccup near the end of part 1.
He looks so happy! Wholesome duo
Aww
I wish them all the happy snuggles!
Awwwwwwwwww
I love this ‚ù§Ô∏è
People can be wonderful.
Cats like,‚Äù...it‚Äôs eye for and eyes.‚Äù
Hopper?
I remember seeing a one-eyed cat at an animal shelter once. It was sitting on top of the back of this one chair. Then when it tried to get down, but had a hard time because of the lack of depth perception. Poor kitty kept trying to lower its paw without falling, not knowing how high up it was.
Is there more to say than aww!
The joy is beyond measurable.
Awwww
Awwww
That made me cry and smile at the same time. What a wholesome picture!
That‚Äôs the most genuine smile I‚Äôve seen in a while

My eyes look like this too, when I pet kitties.
So blessed!! Adorable pals
Very Sweet
So cute. Love it.
Good thing with animals is, they don't judge you at all if you give them a good presence :)
 I'm sorry if I may seem disrespectful in any way, but I can't figure out if the man in this photo is missing an eye or both, if anyone knows, could they tell me?
