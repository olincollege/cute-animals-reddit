Isn't this the best? He also does a little hop! 
I bet he’s a wholesome grandpa too. 
You have to grow old, doesn't mean you ever have to grow up. 
If I understand how well Asian people age correctly, I’d say 218 never looked so good!
This.  This is the best thing.  I love this so much! He's so cute!
You live to be old partly by living and loving life including the small and big things. Homeboy is enjoying his life. 
Absolutely! and keep laughing 😃
Probably my favorite C.S. Lewis quote 

"When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”
His shirt pattern matches the mirror.

Can't remember where I heard this, but it's stuck with me over the years :

"Be an adult when you have to, be a kid when you can." 
Youth is wasted on children
Priceless! And I agree, you're never too old to be a kid. I'm 72, heading up to 73, and hope I never lose the ability to enjoy life's simple pleasures. 
Where can I find one of these?
The Domino’s Noid hasn’t aged well. 
K but where do I get one of these 
r/adorableoldpeople
Awww! I never really got to spend time w/ my grandpas on both side of my family. My mom side he passed away when I was still a baby and on my dad side he was really ill and bedridden. But this r/MadeMeSmile today. :D 
I lost my grandfather a few years back. This makes my heart hurt in a good way, it reminded me if the silly ways he was. Thank you
Hi OP, Im your 100k upvote ;P
Plopperdeplop!
omg this is even better then the doggies and cats this is amazing
When someone tells you to act your age, tell them to go fuck themselves.
Fin got old
Don't know why but I thought he was an inmate.
Man I have a video of my grandpa doing Snapchat filters and laughing so hard. He had never seen this something like and was laughing so hard. 

It was nice seeing him act like his normal self. Not I be a downer but he passed away a couple months later. 

I cherish those videos so much and more than anything it proves that people of all ages love this kind of engagement. 
Is anyone else getting weird uncanny valley vibes ...they don’t look like they match their bodies and surroundings 
Is that the Noid?
"Fairy tales can come true...It can happen to you - if you're young at heart..."
I have strep throat & this made me feel a tiny bit better. ❤️
Love this. I miss my grandpa.
Where can I find one of these hats?
Ok, I’m middle aged by all measures. I was a goofy kid. I was a goofy lunatic hanging out at bars in my 20s. Now I’m a goof at work, having fun when appropriate. 

I absolutely and fully understand this man. This is something I’d do now, and hope I’m able to do when I’m that old. People don’t change. If you know how to create fun in your youth, damn straight I’ll keep creating fun when I’m old 
老人的热爱很温柔💝💝
That made my whole day 
Except for this fossil 
Old people are such kids sometimes. Absolutely adorable! 
That’s pure joy 🤗😁🤪
This is too precious
MY HEARTTTTTTT
How come something like this is wholesome and encouraging, but when I walk around my parents house in an adult diaper its considered "upsetting"
Senior goals
You can be young only once. But you can be immature forever.
Hands down cutest grampa in the world. 
This is awesome he’s so happy 
Does anyone else wish they could hear this too? I feel like it would make it that much better ! 
u/Octavel84 pardonnes-moi, c’est trop cute
I’m off on spring break and I’m visiting my parents. My dad laughed this great belly laugh about the 110 year old lady dancing with the Obamas. That’s real love, just laughing. 
All babies and all old people should be required to wear animal ear hats at all times
Man I miss my grandpa, but at least he's feasting in Odins great hall.
I needed this today, thank you
After seeing this I feel better about growing old
We are all just kids progressively getting wrinklier.
They're so cute!!!
Ok but where do I buy one?!
Stop this is the cutest thing!🥺🥺🥺🥰🥰🥰
I wish I grew up with grandparents.
He doesn't look a day over 113.
Oh my goodness I sent it to my mom and she peed her pants in front of my sister. She recorded it. But it’s a family film now! Lol
This feels so wholesome
Stop infantilizing the elderly. 
asking for a friend but where can one buy this
I love old people "aww". Way better than babies on here. People post babies because they think they look cute... but old people aww is way better because it's an actual moment of adorable-ness, playfulness and innocence.
I love how he smiles and does a little hop!
Such a sweet video.
He’s excited cause that’s the only thing he can get up
You can tell that he is genuinely overjoyed by this.
He is just so happy awww 
There are no words to describe how much joy this gave me. 
#relationshipgoals
r/eyebleach
Well no but actually yes
This made my whole day.  He looks so adorably happy!
He is adorable! 😍👍🏼
I love it he should be a meme 
I have some elf ears ones, I wear them when we go to see my nana in her nursing home. They looove them 
Hahaha this is the best thing on reddit today.
There’s not much I look forward to about getting older. (Except it beats the alternative.)

But I do look forward to doing/saying whatever I want like when I was a kid. 

That part will be fun. 
What kinda hat is that??
Is grandpa in jail?
Once Man, Twice Child. 
Ah he’s a perfect human 
This made me happy :)
My wife is always having her grandma join her for Snapchat pics and her reactions to the filters is always delightful.
You don't stop playing because you get old, you get old because you stop playing
This is so cute! I want to buy one for me and my daughter. 
WHY AM I CRYING? 
This made my evening! ☺️
Probably the cutest thing I’ve seen all day.. and I’ve seen a lot of cute things today
This brings an extreme kind sigh to my heart.
I just wanna know how this hat works I feel dumb trying to figure it out 
Why am I tearing up?
I love that hat. I also love his reaction when he realizes what it does
plot twist: he's 11
Michael Jackson said that too
Good God... they found the real Noid!
this made me so happy 

&#x200B;
I wish this was my grandpa!
Needs more jpeg
This guy is my spirit animal
In the unlikely event of a water-landing (i.e. "CRASHING INTO THE OCEAN"- George Carlin) this man will be able to inflate his safety life-jacket.
Need a better quality.
Where does someone get a hat like this?
That’s gonna be me for sure
Anyone know where I can get one of these?

Oh well, i missed my grandpa now
hahahah thats awesomeeee
Faith in humanity = restored 
When I grow up I wanna be this guy!
being happy is the best. :)
This is the most adorable person I’ve ever seen. AWWW. I hope I’m that youthful still at this age. 
r/mademesmile
You're always a kid, you just pretend not to. 
Never.  It's just that the young.wipper snappers get all jealous when the women like you that are there age. 
Aw I love this!! 
This is priceless
Adorable
r/aww because that is cute and wholesome looking.
It’s the simple things that can bring the most joy. 
Awh my heart 
Love it 
So cute!
Y U lock grammpa up???
The young at heart always seem to get to be the oldest people. 
If anyone has a link to get this hat. shut up and take my money 
Absolutely the thing to be doing in the toilet of a club
The Noid?
This is so sweet
You could tell he was really into that for a few seconds.
Is this Asian George W?
Is this the grandma from Coco?
[deleted]
 God damnit this warms the depths of my bitter heart this made me smile
omg super presh!!
I love this !!
I want to be like this guy when I’m his age!
His little hop actually scared the shit out of me
Tell that to Michael Jackson. 
Where can I get this hat so I can give it to my grandma?? 
The best part about growing up is that you don’t have to worry about acting very grown-up anymore 
To cute!
>You are never to old to be a kid

&#x200B;

\- Michael Jackson's lawyer
Guy in back has a shirt with a bunny on it. Coincidence?
I love it so much lol.
Hey, that's pretty good.
We both know how the hop scotch days were
I thought this said “You are never too old to be kind” and my heart melted. 

...The actual sentiment is just as embracing though. 
This GIF is now my favorite way to feel good
Thsi is beautiful. 
Okay, so... I'm going to need an eBay link.
I can hear this video 
Saw a little boy with his mother come into the store and he was wearing these. Absolute most adorable thing. Whoever invented this is a gift to humanity.
Thank you, I need that
It's fun to imagine the crazy shit this old man has lived through, and the rapid change he's seen.
Viejo degenerado
My heart! This makes me so happy 
This made my day
Today I just legally tourney into not a kid
He's just too cute 😍😍😂
anyone know where to find the full video? 
Where to buy?
I thought they brought the guy a gift to cheer him up in prison when I saw the grills
I don't know why. But looking at this makes me sad.
Naww bless him ^_^ 
This just made my day.
Old people are the funnniest.
Nope...too wholesome...quick, somebody make an incredibly hurtful and/or racist comment!  I can't have this kind of brightness in my life!
I hope I’m like this when I’m old
aaaaw this is waaaay too cute😍❤️
I really needed to see this today. Thank you.
I'm crying ughh so cute
omg that's fucking adorable
This is why I subbed.
Man I love elders that like to be silly. The best kind man.
Thank you!!
I love seeing a shirt the same color as the wall behind it.
This is precious:’)
This made my day!
I watched this with BLɅƆKPIИK playing in the background. 1,000% better. Haha.
Does anyone knows were I can buy one of those?? Asking for a friend
OMG, my heart is melting
That's just heartwarming and adorable as all hell
/r/BetterEveryLoop 
Is it just me, or is his head absolutely enormous.  I honestly thought this was photoshopped when I first saw it.
Old men are adorable you can’t convince me otherwise 
adults are just kids who were here longer. 
I love you grandpa
Lol
What is going on here?
His outfit looks like something a random humanoid species would wear in Star Trek: TNG.
This is so wholesome. 
Now that’s funny 😂
You can't tell me that's not a Meow cosplay hat from Space Dandy.
This is so wholesome :) it makes me smile so much
This is so whoelsomeeeee my heart hurts from joy
This is just too cute ! :)
I'm melting! What have you done to my stone cold heart!
This is by far the cutest thing on Reddit.
He puts a smile on my face.  😆
/u/Lilclanky 
I smiled so much looking at that
This man needs to be blessed by every religion
I love it! 💗 His smile is nothing but pure joy! 
Manage your life like a adult live it like a child. 
wah this so fun for grandpa
Man....I miss my gramps
Aww thats friccing awesome!
I love his grandpa onesie
Always be a kid man
Domino’s Noid
That moment probably added to his life. 
Oh my goodness! I love him 😄 
LOL you can actually buy those in Korea! haha
This is exactly how I imagine my grandpa would react if he could try this on today. I miss him.
He's only 25 in China
I need this hat for my father in law with dementia...
He’s so cute! This totally made my day :)
Can we also take a moment to appreciate the rest of his outfit?? What is he wearing?? I love it!!
His face when she shows him how the "ears" move. It's just too pure. This is beautiful.

As my granny said "Age only matters if you're wine or cheese."
Can he be my grandpa?😊 Both of mine passed many years ago. He is so adorable!😁
Old people having fun makes my heart so happy
Omigoodness 😄
This gave me so many happy feels. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Is this meow’s hat from Space Dandy
Lol. I love this.
His sweater match the mirror.
Where is RBG
love this, thanx for sharing 
omg this is so funny 😂😂
Kid at heart
This should be a life goal for everyone seeing it.
Adorable 😊
Yes, but are you ever too young to be elderly?
Cuteee
Is that the Dalai Lama?
What's the point of growing up if you don't get to be childish sometimes?
This brightened my entire week.
r/mademesmile
I’m going into cardiac arrest
Awwwww <3
God I wish this had audio
So, so wholesome
This is so gonna be me, this is already me now at a half century.
Makes me miss my granpas
This is so precious! I could have totally seen my grandpa do this.
He should be a character in a Studio Ghibli movie!
And then he choked himself? It looks dangerous for kids though
but you're never too young to be old. 
well age is just a number :P
I hope I am always this way
This is great. 
Can I adopt him?
What Ghibli film is this?
OH MY GOD HE'S SO FREAKING ADORABLE!!! ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ ❤️ 
Wow this is the most amazing thing I’ve seen all day! 
You have no idea how much this made me smile
Dig this so much!
This is the cutest thing ever!!! 😭
Kids are just old people in training 
This is so pure
Pure joy! Love it!
I needed this today. These folks look like my grandparents but sadly time has been taking its toll on them and ive been sad over it. Thanks
💋🥰
His reaction is cute and all but how the hell does that thing work?? At one point he's not even pulling on them and they're pointed up
The joy on his face <3
The Noids still got it!
Love this. I want to adopt them as my grandparent.
SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I really wanna know the context of this gif. 
He’s 6 he just has Benjamin button disease
His Louise cosplay is dope
Wow
Like I always say, age is just a number.
Old generation is the best.
That is the best!!!
Show your humanity on your sleeve. P.s. I need this hat ♡
This makes me smile... Thank you for posting ::) 
This is so cute
Hits me right in the feels. I was already sore from earlier. 
He looks SO happy!
This is my favorite advice, I believe there is a time and a place for everything. Growing up isn't forgetting how to be a kid, it's just knowing the appropriate times to bring that kid out and knowing when to let up haha.
Reminds me of the noid.
Wait until he finds out you can press one at a time 
This is the best omg
Reminds me of my grandpa wayy tooo much! I miss him😞😞😞
That is so sweet. Everyone is engaged in his joy.
I should order one for my grandma!
I love this so much.
Omg the feels! Right in the heart 
❤
I bet he's the kind of grandad that tells ridiculous but funny jokes and tells tall tales that always have some truth to them
But you can be too kid to be old
And........ tears starts falling from nowhere. 


Gosh, he made me think about my boyfriend's grandma that passed just this January. She was so cheery and happy and still a lot like a kid inside. She had so much joy. I miss her lots. 
Dude that's just Bobby Lee..
Thank you, this made my morning 👶
:,)
Awesome but he’d face nothing but ridicule walking the streets in America. Professional dream killers walk these streets!
Kinda sad, though. My mom has Alzheimer's. I see her slipping. Acting more and more like a child each month... Between the moments of playful bliss, there are a lot of sad, confused, and frustrating moments. Breaks my heart.
It made my day...
This is incredible! And to this this content came from the same group where the grandson taught his grandma to cuss! I much prefer the wholesome content like this!

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zbr-1ZieeuU
Too cute
😊 
This is wholesome af. Made my entire day. 
\**Happiness noises\** 
Where can I get this hat? 
I have been very grumpy all morning and I think this cured me.
Thank you, I needed that.
I've never wished for sound more than when I saw this one! 
This just made my day
🐰
I want to be like him as a grandpa.
Cutest thing I saw on internet today 😭😍🖤🖤
Guys, it's the noid
Love it
I get goofier and goofier as I get older.
i am this man
So pure! 🙂
[removed]
Well there it is. Pure joy! What a lovely thing to see!
I want him to be my grandpa.
His smile of pure joy, makes me smile.
This family’s all about floppy ears. Check out the guys shirt in the background.
These are the cutest, they were all over Tokyo when I was there last month. They had red ones just like this at the Alvark Tokyo b-league basketball game. Actually, all the merch at that game was lit.
I mean I guess, but that man is really only 42 years old 
this makes my heart so full, so pure. i wants one of those hats
This is heart warming!
This is the friggin’ CUTEST. 
The audible ...Ooo.. I hear coming outta his mouth make this even cuter if possible
This is so cute
"You have to grow old, but you don't have to grow up!"
Aw he's so happy ❤
OMG, I couldn't close my lips from smiling for 10 mins and now my face muscles cramped. Thank you OP.
This literally made my entire day
When he changed his face expression “oohh”
Man this makes me miss my grandpa, used to hang out with him all the time while he'd video tape me running around the living room. 
When I first glanced at this I thought "oh my god! Why is he locked up behind a fence!" Then I realized it was a mirror and actually made a happy little squee sound. This is great. Makes my heart happy.
Cute, wholesome, made my day here is my up arrow take them all!!!!!!
Adults are just kids with more XP and responsibilities.
Man I wish I could hear the laughter in this gif
Aww yeah, Tencent paying for Ohanian's groceries once again!
This is me at the carnival, with my ice cream in hand, joyous with the parents I’ve never had with a lil pup by my side.

I love the little hop to help the ears aling. It reminds me of grandma tilting and lifting the nintendo controllers to help out Mario
With this many up arrows I think you made history with this!  This is the best r/aww post isn’t it so CUTE?!!!   I love this post that why I gave it an up arrow.
Thank you Reddit. I was having a hell of a shitty day and this made me smile.
Don't have my glasses on and thought it was danny devito for a hot second
I don't think this belongs in r/aww.. but it still made my day 
I love this so much!
This makes me so happpppy!

Right but if somebody in his thirties were doing this everybody would tell them to grow up 
This might belong to r/aww only 🤯.  Because it is a nice post😁.
Aww, isn't that adorable.

The man has a giant head. I can't get passed it. I...I don't like it...

Guarantee he's enjoying his children's reactions more than the hat.

Now fit me one under my pants! 
FBI open up
Why are old people so similar to children. They're both fucking weird.
