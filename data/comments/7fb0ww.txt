You are supposed to hold up today's newspaper next to the hostage.  Amateurs. I swear.
I hope you captioned the pic "He's my kitten now"
Give me my cat back you old coop 
You should have dropped by a pet store or something and taken a picture of another kitten that looks nothing like this one and sent that instead.
Keep it close, we can see what the dog did to the last one back there..
/r/shouldercats 
Some captions you can send along with the pic.  
"Me hanging out with my favorite baby"  
"I love this kitten more than anything else in the world"  
"Daughter, I wrote you out of my will and replaced you with kitten"  
My sister calls these "proof of life" photos.... she sends them to me regularly when she keeps my son.
When my hooman  
She iz away  
With her daddy  
Iz wher I stay  

I don't need to  
Go to my bed  
I sitz on him  
I stare at hed  
Man your head is so SMOOTH. Your skin is flawless, it looks like you're rendered! Your wife a dermatologist or something ?

EDIT: To save me answering to different people asking the same thing: it wasn't a gender/sexist thing folks. I was making the point of how a partner will use their skills on you. If this person was a woman I'd ask if her husband was a dermatologist. Also, I wasn't referring to his baldness as an insult, it didn't even click to me that it wasn't self-applied baldness. I simply thought this was his style, and he rocked it!

Not everything is malicious :)
On the slippery slope to becoming a Disney Princess 
Kitten is cute as hell. Also thanks for your service.
Wow, front page! Thanks guys! 
Oooh 💜🐾 so tiny weenie. 
Hello fellow cat sitter!

You married?

Can there be a subreddit for hot dads and kittens?
Kitty aproves grandpa.
Army kitten.
“Made.”  You’re enjoying every minute of it. I see how my dad cuddles my cat when I’m not around. 
What did you do to ruin her trust
You are a good grandad 
The dog in the Bg is just going

#”*Point*”
Jokes on her....kitten is babysitting you.
Is that a ducktoller back there?
You're a good dad. My wife's father won't even see his own daughter anymore because they don't believe in the same religion. You're a good father and your daughter is a lucky girl.  Good on your sir.
Is that a duck toller or a golden?
Well I see one brave soul who refuses to switch to the new PTs.
If I were his daughter, I'd be asking why David Cross is taking a selfie with my kit kat.
So her pet dog and parrot are safe, what about the kitten?
She may not get him back.

To be honest, I was expecting a picture like [this one](http://catplanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Introducing.jpeg)
You look like my old boss that I hated. He made me cry once. Jerk. Cute kitten though.
It's like he can see straight through to the other side
How in heaven did you guys get that kitten to wear the collar. Mine literally dropped to the floor until we took it off him 
Anthony old mantano here with Daughters kittens new ep
I find it funny your child trusts you so little she insists you send proof of life.

Your out of regulation OP!
Hi David Cross!
Looks like u got adopted by a new master
"Anthony Fantano here..."
Not sure if David Cross with a kitten...
What's the kittens name?! 
That......is the most adorable creature I've laid eyes upon in 12 days. 

The kitten, that is.
"That is not our dog" 
-probable text back from daughter
Literally made me awww out loud. He is so precious.
Needs more pooping dog.
Do you think all those years in the service properly prepared  you for your slow progression into a Disney princess? 
...Tobias Fünke?
That fucking collar is amazing.
How did you feel when you blue yourself?
I see that hoodie
The kitty whispers in his ear: “ You tell her everything’s okay and you won’t get what the dogs getting. Smile, convince me.” 
Everything about this post is purrfect!!!
"Are you seeing this?"

Your doing a fine job pops!
You look alot like mr herko
I guess thats the difference between a dad and a brother.

A brother, would have found a pic of a dead cat on the internet and sent it.
Read that as 'she requested poof' 
She needs to cut that thicc Bermuda turf grass 
Find someone who looks at you the way this kitten looks at this guy.
Go army
"What's she doing? Is she okay right meow? Is she coming back soon?" --cat
I also ask for Proof of Life photos of my fur babies when I’m out of town 😂
Oh my god I wonder when you took this it would be so cute and go viral
You look like a mix between Goldberg and Batista.

Meanwhile dog is scanning the area to make it kitten proof. :'D
Nice job Army dad 
I’m actually mad at how fucking cute this is
Freaking adorable. You’re doing it right!
I love the look the kitten's giving him. LOL

Everyone asking about the cat. I'm just wondering what that dog is so interested in?! 
Every time this comes into my news feed I melt, the kitty is so gosh darn cute!!!!!
You're a disney princess.
I’m not fooled by your nonplussed expression, you love that kitten so much that you’re considering keeping her.
That is obviously a toy kitty, as it is too cartoonishly cute to be a real life kitten. So.. what have you done with the real kitten?
You’re a Disney princess now
Kittens like...dude..ur head is so cute
Who's a good boy...mew.
Damn daddy can you babysit me?
Someone should let him know that's a parrot. /s
BabelKatt ?
"He told me all your secrets."
that's a cute kitten.
OMFG that kitten is awesome!
David cross?
I can see through to the other side

- cat
She seems to really trust you. 
You went all disney princess on us
Does anyone else see the resemblance to David Cross?
You might want to check your left ear for bugs.
Kinda looks like he's looking in one ear and out the other to see what's on the other side.
You look like the guy who kidnapped the chipmunks

He sold that kitten for crack money.
Reminds me of Pruitt Taylor Vince...
Damn, i miss my old army sweats
How much for the shoulder cat? 
(Robert Conrad voice)  "Go ahead.  Knock it off.  I dare you..."
Looks like this guy is going to take advantage of that cats singing abilities 
You look like the bad guy from Alvin and the chipmunks. 
He’s looking at his reflection
“Hooman why don’t you have any hair on your head?”
Such a cute kitten!
PROOF OF LIFE SENT.
NOW TRANSFER THE REST OF THE MONEY BY 1400HRS.

Shoulder kitty best kitty
Proof of Life
Should have taken a pic of it in the oven.  Off of course!
She was like, "send me a pic, right meow" 
That kitten is smitten 😍
"had to"
So what's the general rule for bringing a little kitty outside?
Solid kitty. No fear even on a high shoulder. Like a boss!
To nom or not to nom. 

That is the question.
Whoever said Dog is man's best friend? What's Dog doing here? More interested in the kitten shit in the grass then the hooman, I suspect. Cat wins.
I love the way he looks at you
The dog looks like he’s farting. #perfecttiming
That’s so fucking cute I can’t even.
Most kittens are cute, but that is easily one of the cutest! 
Walter white: car sitter 
I would have put him in the oven (without the heat on)
Kitty : What were you thinking hooman? 
He's entranced by the shininess of your head OP
This is some backwards shit

That kitten is so adorable what kind of breed is he?
Thats all well and good to do when the cat is little but its hard to break them of the habbit my cousin has a fat 27 lbs house cat who thinks nothing of trying to jump onto the shoulders of unsuspecting people to try and get a better seat at the table...it dose NOT feel good
Where's the newspaper with today's date?

Great Dad❣️❣️❣️❣️
You could do a killer Tobias costume 
Tobias?
Aww! That's adorable! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻😻
no love for the dog😥
ie I was home with my cat and took a selfie
I'm a little worried you have the cat out doors where it can escape and close to a dog. Maybe that's just me being over protective though.
Omg! I'm melting! 
Should have sent her a picture of you with an obiously different cat.

Or better yet, a whole different species of animal.
I can him screaming for the custody of 3 talking Chipmunks just for money
Shut. The. Front. Door.

You are ADORABLE!!!!
I'm more interested in what the dog in the background found with his super sniffer.... 
Did the doggo being give the kitten a boop?

Is your ear ok? looks to me like the mini murder machine is sizing up its first victim.
I'm usually not a very animated person, but my jaw dropped wide open for a good 5 seconds when I saw that. Ridiculously cute 😀
Everytime I see pics like this I'll think to myself: "Hmm why don't I have a pet O WAIT THATS CUZ MY PARENTS DONT LET ME" 
The dog feels left out. 
He reallllly likes your ear hair.
"What's this? God, Sally you've gotten ugly!"
Where are the people who scream and moan about women including themselves in pictures of things?
Photo right before he fell and broke his neck.
This kitty seems like a good kitty.
Cool story bro
I hope you stop by the eye doctor's and have your glasses straightened out once she's back
You, sir, are very very bald.

You look like my old history teacher. Cool.
Your kitten now.
Dog is on point telling you where she poopied.

It’s looking at it reflection on ur shines scalp. 
Should have waited for the dog to poop
That's a weird looking kitten. The dog on your shoulder is cute though. 
Without today’s paper, how does your daughter know when this picture was taken?


You just became a Disney princess.  Goodnight your majesty.
Most adorable paws! So cute it's almost painful.😍
OMG!Squee!!!!!

I miss her more than anything :'(
Fuck it. I'm getting a cat

Hey your dog is Broken!!!
Good dad, good dog.
A request for a "proof of life" photo shows a distinct lack of trust on your daughters part.
Omg this is so much cuteness

Oh hey Jony Ive. Where do you find time to babysit a kitten between recording voiceover for Apple videos??
That is one small dog. 
you are a good man.  
I always knew you were a great man, David Cross!
That kitten may be the cutest thing i have ever seen.  And my cat is pretty dang cute.
I'm sure it's called "kittysitting".
“U wot mate??”
Aww, it thinks it’s a parrot!
I swear once you're a father pets/animals in general just seem to naturally gravitate towards you. I've noticed it with every male in my family who's a father...



“It’s so shiny”
When looking after someone else's pet take lots of photos early on. That way if something does happen you've bought yourself time to leave the country.
Cute Kitty.
Okay...
Some fucked up shit right there homie 
So cute!! Thank you for giving me a wonderful start to my day :)
Alternate cation from the dog: 💩
Well Tobais, glad to see you're doing fine without the blue man group.

Or the kitten send your daughter somewhere else and requested you to babysit her.Forced you to take a picture and send to your daughter because she's fed up with her.

Oh hi daddy 
You should have gone to the nearest store and held it up with a completely different kitten while taking the picture.
Looks good to me!
kitten is very confused :)
this is amazing
Cats don’t need baby sitting
You should have sent a picture of the kitten with a copy of last weeks newspaper to add confusion.
This picture made me happy
Nice sweater. 
I speak cat. Cat says feed me treat.
So your daughter needed proof of life?

Your dog just found the kitten shit.
For a solid 38 seconds I thought you were my best friend from high school's dad. But then I realized your sweatshirt says ARMY and he was in the Navy. 
You're the best dad ever, you know that? 
only a paw and today's newspaper is required for proof of life
Best father award goes to you!
Oh my gosh. That kitten is too cute. What is his name, and how old is he?
The cat looks like it's whispering, "Tell he I behaved, okay?"
