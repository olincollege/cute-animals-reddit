You don't seem too busy. 
This should be considered "sad content" i want to love him
My heart plummeted when he dropped that toy. Poor baby.
ON MY WAY
I would be so fired.
r/petthedamndog
Great, now my heart is broken. Thanks, Reddit. 
I would consider it pretty much "sad content"
Why is no one paying attention to him?!? Someone play with him! Pleaaaase lol 
[deleted]
Someone better play fetch right now you monsters

Edit: im glad my most upvoted comment is about a dog
This is not how you should treat your colleagues :l
`git fetch toy`
[deleted]
I would literally take a 10k pay cut to work in a place that allowed dogs at work
I would have dropped everything and played with the doggo in a heart beat.

i'm waiting here so patiently - i am de GOODEST BOY  
no one looks too busy - Kelly? Phyllis - watcha doin?

my Favorite frens have just arrived: here comes Jim n Pam :)
Looks like there might be an important board meeting to have in there right now.
Honestly if I had a dog at work I do t think I'd ever get anything done ever again. 
#SOMEONE GO ON A BREAK AND PLAY WITH THE BOYE!!!
Everyone who does not play fetch with office dog is FIRED
OMG please play with him, that poor baby lol
JUST THROW THE TOY AND LOVE HIM DAMMIT
EVERYONE STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING FIND THIS PUPPER AND PLAY WITH HIM FOR GOD SAKES WHAT IS THIS WORLD COMING TO?!?!?!!?!;!!?!!!?
##THROW THE DAMN TOY
Throw the ball you monster!
They don't deserve him. I deserve him.
PLAY WITH HIM
Goddamnit stop recording and go play with the cute doggie wtf
When there is a cute animal in the office, no work gets done. 
Why would you lock him in an office, that’s mean. 
PLAY WITH HIM, YOU MONSTERS!!!
SOMEONE PLAY WITH THE DOG NOW.
Why is he in the office to begin with give that dog some fun and air
I don't think I'd get any work done with an office dog. I'd be rolling on the floor with it like an idiot. 
That’s just a straight shooter with “upper management” written all over him.
Looks like Seymour from Futurama, which only makes this more depressing
Am I the only one who thinks office dogs are a bad idea?  Taking care of a dog is itself a part-time job (and one that loses you money).  If you plan on giving the dog a good home, I just don't see how the benefits outweigh the cost.
Someone play with him please ;w;
All I would do is play with the dog - wouldn’t get any work done for sure
I would so neglect my duties to play with this lil puppa 
:[
**SOMEONE PLAY FETCH WITH HIM**
For the love of all that is good in the world, just throw the toy!
How does an "office dog" work? Do employees rotate taking  the dog home in the of hours? Is it the bosses dog? Does he live in the office forever? So many questions. 
SOMEONE PLEASE PLAY WITH HIM
“And the cat’s in the cradle and the silver spoon...” 
I’ll play fetch with you, you sweet angel. ❤️
People busy doing work in an office? What is this world coming to?
I always thought the idea of 'office pet' was weird for this reason. It's like a prop to convince you it's a happy working environment.

"Come check out our games room"  

*No time to play*

That's been my experience anyway.
I love dogs, but what happens if someone at the workplace is allergic to them? 
“Boof” 
[deleted]
play with him yOu MONSTERS
So cute 😍
I wouldn't be too busy, I can assure you. 
Monsters, the whole lotta ya...
BUT HE LOVES YOU YOU MONSTERS
You go play with that son of a bitch.  ^heh ^^^**HAH**
Didn’t see what subreddit this was and said “aww” when I saw this haha.
My heart broke 
I would never be able to pass by that office window without stopping to see the little guy! He's just too cute! 
I swear I will write you all up if no one plays fetch with that dog!
Yesterday, there was a bird at my empty birdbath trying to dip a berry in the water.  Instead of filming this poor little creature picking up and dropping the berry with no success, I went to fill the bird bath with water.  Now release the pup from office jail and throw the toy immediately. 
r/donthelpjustfilm 
It’s so nice their company lets them bring their dog. My old office job made all the desks face a wall because our CEO thought the view of palm trees out the window would be “too distracting”. His desk had a great window view though. 
Humans are so inconsiderate
Someone wasn't too busy to record this video.
free him
This dog really deserves to fetch a toy ASAP !! 
How can I get to a job where there is an office dog?
Go play with it, you monster!! 
Set up a schedule for people to play with her! Everyone can afford a few minutes! And work better for the break. 
Great now my heart is broken thanks
SOMEONE GET OVER THERE AND PLAY WITH HIM RIGHT FUCKING NOW
"how much simpler do i have to make it for these people!"
idiots!


GET AN INTERN TO PLAY WITH THAT DOG!!!

You know what? I'll do it myself.

The moment the pup sees someone, its eyes light up, then drops the toy... then nothing. Heartbreaking. That doggo needs the entire office to play with outside. You should get overtime during the day for that.
Every place of employment should have at least one pup legally. Like it needs to be a law.
"Hey kind lady, would you spare a moment to indulge me with some fet...I do say! This is preposterous! I demand my playtime as a good lad."
WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE CAN WALK BY AND NOT PLAY?!?!?
WORST OFFIC EVER!!!

r/petthedamndog
My office has that same shitty carpets, looks like a crappy used car sales floor. 
Damn it Linda don't walk past the puppy and ignore it!
and you just sat there and watched him suffer?!
He just scheduled a meeting but nobody is there on the appropriate time, I would have felt bamboozled too. Over time scritches for everyone involved. 
😂 you guys kill me, you feel sorry for the dog and want to save it, but what about the poor people who are in these offices that just want to play, but can't. Who will save them? 
Let me inside that damn gif!

/r/HighQualityGifs - I need your help! Get me in there, it's an emergency!
“Office Dog”...... must be a California thing.
Get back to work! 
I see you must work at monsters inc.
I play fetch every day at work! 

I fetch coffee, copies, and reports. Wish I could play fetch with this pup. 
PLAY WITH HIMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

I think I might not be able to sleep tonight if someone doesn't tell me a few seconds later someone was playing fetch with him. 
PLAY FETCH WITH HIM YOU MONSTER
Wait, is no one acknowledging this is an office dog? Where is this acceptable, because I have an impeccable resume. 
why do you have an office dog if you will not play with office dog

*monsters*
SOMEONE PLAY WITH HIM RIGHT NOW!
Those eyes, and when he drop the toy. 
OMW
THIS IS ANIMAL CRUELTY PET HIM ALREADY ;-;
“Move my 4 o’clock to tomorrow. Something just came up.”
PLAY WITH HER YOU MONSTER.
Reminds me of a photo I have where a little puppy like that stares at me from inside someones office, and I couldn't play with it because the guy in the office were in a meeting. :(
STOPPPPP
Awww!! All he wants to do is play.
I think he was saying to the human that just walked by "Screw you!  Don't you see I am a cute doggo with a toy????" Let's play fetch!!"
This place is a prison! 
For the love of god some one throw the toy for this poor dogo!
long hours at the office can be pretty ruff sometimes.
r/petthedamndog
Poor dog
How much can you work? Play with it! You do not notice life.
Awe someone play with him!!!
Yey
y'all better heckin' drop everything and play with him right now!
I wish i could bring my dog to work 
Yep, would definitely lose my job for playing with the doggo too much and not getting anything done
Good Job, Business Dog!
You get back there and play with this good boy right now!!! I’m not crying, you’re crying! 
How to teleport to someone's office ?
You don't deserve him
Where do you work and do you a need an intern whose duties consist of the throwing and catching a myriad of items around the office? I'm also proficient in excel and belly rubs.
Was that a synthetic Alicia Vikander walking past without even looking at the puppy?
Awwwww :(
Omg noooo
Office dog? what in the what now?
"Oops, i dropped my toy. Boy, it sure would be a shame if someone were to snatch it up and throw it..."
>If it takes forever, I will wait for you

>For a thousand summers, I will wait for you

>Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you

>Till I hear you sigh here in my arms

>Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go

>Every day remember how I love you so

>In your heart believe what in my heart I know

>That forevermore I'll wait for you
Can i be the office dogs human?
SOMEONE PLAY FETCH WITH THE POOR DOG YOU MONSTERS!!!
That’s just cruel let him go be happy somewhere 
THROW THE TOY YOU MONSTER 
PLAY FETCH WITH HER YOU MONSTER
I would stop everything and play fetch! Never too busy for a pupper. 
My heart 😭
This has to be scripted. There is no way a person can walk past this cutie!!! Look at those big brown eyes!!! 
The disappointment on the dog’s face hit me in the feels
SOMEONE PLAY WITH HIM WORK IS NOT IMPORTANT
Or a dog’s way of alt tabbing when the boss walks by
Johnson go throw the intern’s squeaky 
Just put that camera away and play with that damn dog!
My rule for up\-voting is if I make an audible sound as a reaction to seeing it I up\-vote. THIS PASSED! AHHHHH
I can throw ball for hours while doing something else. I have to do it all the time. I think that office needs a "ball break" for each employee. You must take 5 minutes during the day to through the ball, at least 2 or 3 times a week. With enough employees that dog would be tired at the end of the day and the humans would have a little playtime while not interfering with work.
If I could bring my smallest pup to work, she'd sleep in laps all day as a happy friend to everyone.  Her separation anxiety has been tough since she was adopted a few months ago.  If only we could bring pets to work.
What???

No hooman will play with me?

Well, then I’m just gonna make poopy on this rug right here.

Serves you right.
For the love of all things holy! Someone play with that good boy!!
This is the wrong kind of aww! Im in pain :(
You monsters... 
This “office dog” is doing his job so well, people are motivated and working hard! The company must be a government contractor; the best and most effective workers get neglected 😩 


How did that lady walk past that puppy without even looking at it? I have to believe she's a heartless and soulless individual.
Call a 15 minute meeting and throw the toy for this hard working good boy 
I bring my dog to the music venue I work at and on show days, all he wants to do is run around the venue and say hi to everyone and play but when they’re loading in equipment, he is very much in the way. Right now he’s just staring at me, very pissed off that he can’t go play with the band. 
Just wait till he rises through the ranks and becomes the boss dog. Fetch all day and tummy rubs all afternoon. He won’t be too busy to play with then muahaha! 
Poor puppy, just wants a play...
:(
How do you say "No" to that face?!  Bunch of monsters work there.
As an office human, this is exactly how I feel.
We don't deserve dogs😢
Pet that dog, NOW!!!
Aww!! I can play fetch with him!😆
Fuck work, I’ll get fired to play with that little guy
Office dog? Where is that place? Send me an application and sign me up!
SOMEONE GO PET HIM.
Somebody play fetch with him right now 
If everyone’s so busy... what are you doing?

But seriously that dog is so cute...
PLAY WITH HIM YOU MONSTERS
Get your ass out there and play fetch with office dog!!!
Ohhh sweet angel
What kind of sick fuck trophy hunts a dragon
my heart just shattered
"thanks for the ball, dad, come on let's play"  
Can you teach me to throw, I said, "not today  
I got a lot to do," he said, "that's okay"
Get this dog an intern!
Go play fetch, you monster!

I would quit my job and keep the dog.
that face is a valid excuse to not work. 
I volunteer!
This is cruel to watch 😩 He’s to frickin adorable not to be snuggled 24/7 😍
WHO WOULD DO THAT TO HIM look at that sweet little face
Y no play with good boi 
🐶 How can everyone ignore such a cute doggie??? 🐶
He looks so sad, like so many people but no one wants to play 
You all should be fired for ignoring your duties. 




Poor dog. 
That's why I don't get why people take their dogs to work (unless it is an emotional support dog)
What's an office dog? 
Won't somebody please think of the doggo?!?!?! 

Throw the damn toy!! 
Dogs shouldn't be at the office anyway... has Silicon Valley taught you nothing?
„Office dog“?

What the fuck is this shit?
MONSTERS! PLAY WIT DAT PUPPER! 
Now I am sad. Stop using reddit and play fetch with that pupper
This is the first time I've ever actually "awwwww"-ed out loud on this sub. Good work breaking through my calloused heart of stone, OP.
You monsters.
Poor dog 😩
Nice gif but all I could think of is that I have that exact same chair in my office.
Poor baby. I’d be there in a heartbeat. 
oh my goodness, this is heartbreaking!!
this should be in [/r/awwwwmaaaaaaan](https://reddit.com/r/awwwwmaaaaaaan)
FOR GODS SAKE PLEASE PLAY WITH THAT GOODEST OF BOYES!
My heart just sank.  I want to play fetch all day with this little guy.  
Someone play fetch with this doggo please!!!!
Um excuse me!  I wouldn't be too "busy" to play fetch with the office dog.
Doggie: “what is wrong with these humans???” 
Um, you should hire him a professional playmate. That baby deserves attention!

P.S. Where do I send my resume?
It probably shouldn't, but this makes me kind of sad

I WILL PLAY WITH YOU PUPPER
THROW HIM THE DAMN TOY!!!
Just play with him, do it
If I had an office dog, it’d be mandatory to have a 10 minute dog break. Belly scritches required 
Awwwwww and he even dropped it!
 And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon ... :(
Productivity would come to a screeching haunt we my office had dogs.
Step 1 hand in notice. Step 2 play with dog until security arrive. 
That doggo looks so sad. How can people walk past that window and not play with him?
Your office does not deserve this good boy.
I will pay you if I can just come to the office and play with that dog. 
Is that a cocker spaniel?  They so love to play.
I don't think he wants to play fetch, I think he just wants to get out of that office.
Stop recording and play fetch damn it!!!!!!
YOU CORPORATE SHILLS PLAY FETCH WITH THE DOG IMMEDIATELY GODDAMMIT
Ill play with you, puppers!! My office encourages it so come on over anytime. 
STOP what you are doing and play with the doggy right now!
I really hope someone played with him 
I’d never work if I had an office dog.
I would accomplish nothing if I worked with an office dog.
That's it now come and play or.....
Awwe the life of an office doggie... Poor thing.. Hope he got to play fetch on lunch 
My dream job now is working at an office that has a doggo.
“…I quit!”
top sad anime scenes
Work must be the strangest concept to doggos. For them, a workday involves catching a duck, or a cat, or a rabbit. Meal acquired, work done. And it's *fun,* too! I suppose for domesticated dogs, that's not even the case since they just get a food bowl from their owners.

So their "job" is play, play, nap, play, poop, play, nap, extended nap, play, and sprinkle in some cuddles. 

Like, what are you hoomans doing? Obviously you're not pooping or napping, why can't we play?
Somebody take him home!
Awe! So adorable lol.
GO PLAY FETCH WITH THE CUTE PUPPY!
One of you motherfuckers play with him.
Somebody needs to take 5 to play fetch with the puppy 
First post to make me actually say "aww"

Hey OP give me a job so I can play with the dog.
I wish I could bring my doggy to work :(

Cute. Sad. Cute.

There’s always time for fetch.

I'm the dog.
And I threw it on the ground!!!!
That’s cause you don’t bring your fucking dog to work, better yet don’t own a dog if you can’t make time for it. 
Nobody is THAT busy! Y'all just need to get priorities straight.
All are busy in there work..  I love to play with that dog
You monsters. 😩
This hurts the pup
Aww
Isn't this the flaw in the 'office dog' idea?
I look like this when i see a handsome man
Yes Fran, i know he wants to play catch, but I'm looking at the Weenus and I'm not happy!!
Aw
Uh...did...did you play fetch??
Wtf is with gray carpets in offices. Every office that's getting new carpets seems to be going with some gray pattern. I honestly think your office has the identical carpet we just got installed. 
We have the most lovable arson k-9 in our office and NONE of us can withstand her "play with me" face. The folks in this gif are heartless!
All work and no play makes him a good boi.
You better went to play with that dog as soon as the gif ended. 
Then play with him/her, don't stand their recording. Fuck's sake, what is wrong with humans...
I'll play with him! 
Where is he/she? I'll play fetch all day. 
Damn that’s a cute pup. Golden spaniel?
Come on go play with the dog. 
It’s the only video I want to see today and it’s the only one that is not working on reddit for me!! 😭
Always wanted to know where office dogs sleep
THROW THE BALL YOU GODDAMN MONSTER
Pupper tries a fetch
Awwww... someone stop and play fetch with that poor thing
How dare they! if i was the boss i would be ordering someone probably myself to play with that dog.The day you're too busy to play with a dog is the day............sorry cannot think of an ending.
You go play with that adorable little pupper immediately you sick fuck. How dare you film animal cruelty with such nonchalant apathy 
Where is this...?   I'LL go play fetch with him.  
AWW FUCK. This is heartbreaking
Where is this office? I'll be on my way when you let me know?
This is the saddest thing I've seen today. Will somebody, for the love of the old gods (whom shalt not be named) think of the poor pupper and play with him/her.
I'LL DO IT, WAIT THERE DEAR BOY I'M ON MY WAY
PLAY WITH HIM DAMNIT

Notice me !!!!!!
Where did I go wrong to not get to work in an office with a pupper.
This makes my heart melt

THROW THE TOY YOU MONSTER 
My manager brings her two dogs in every day who are super affectionate and lovely but they smell :( it's a shame as id love to get them scritches 
Screw work, I’m playing with that dog 
What the hell is an office dog and why doesn't my workplace have one? That dog would never be left like that on my watch. 
I would risk a write up just to give the pupper some playtime 
That just makes me feel sad. The snout to glass boop that left a slight mark.
Play with him, you monsters! 😭
Why the hell did they lay the carpet tile two different directions???!!!! Hall vs Room. Terrible design. Also the rubber wall base has a seam in the worst spot. Amateurs I tell ya!
What kind of dog is this?
Oh so sad
That dog is the only one with their priorities in order. 
That’s what he gets for being a corporate lapdog.
I hope that pup peed on the carpet in retaliation.
All y’all need to stop what you’re doing and play with that good boy. The company can wait!
They should pay someone to pay with the dog.
These people are monsters
Awwww he's like hey guys. Guys. Guys
 Guys, I'm right here.  Right here! 
What kind of monster just walks by?  Our corporate lawyer, who sits in the office behind me, brought hers in and I sat in there playing and petting for a good 20 minutes.  
Fuck it I can find a new job. 
This broke my heart
God dammit someone should be getting paid in a rotating shift to make sure those needs are met! 
I’m not crying, you’re crying. 
This bums me out. I wanna play with that dog.
Who the fuck has an " Office Dog " ?
SOMEONE PLAY WITH THAT PUPPY!!!
Umm, yeah.  If you could fetch me the latest TPS report that would be great.
it should be mandatory to hire someone specifically to play with the office dog if everyone is too busy! 
My heart 
SOMEBODY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLAY FETCH WITH THAT PUP!!!
Someone play fetch with him right goddamn now
Why the hell would you keep a dog in an office? It just seems very cruel to me.

Someone play with him! 
Fuck me this is exactly what I'm like playing video games online on a day off.
Op, you best have played with that poor pupper.
I didn’t come here to feel
Why bring your dog to work to lock them in an office?
"This is fricking bull heck, why do i come to work everyday if no one's going to play with me?"
Hay no que hermosos 💕
I'll play fetch with him. Poor little guy
More like "baww"! Someone play with that pupper, dammit!
why didnt you go over and give it pets?
I came here for cute animals, not to have my heart broken repeatedly.
Down voted cause this is just sad. Office dog won't be a puppy forever and is missing out on prime play time :( 
This made me way too sad. 
awww look at him so huggable
Poor little guy !
Such a sweet face! 
I just gave my dog a big hug and taking her to play fetch after seeing this
I would be fired in a week if there was a puppy where I worked. My productivity would drop 70% due to playing with, and thinking about playing with the puppy!
Damn dog...who do you think pays for your food and a roof over your head! Ain’t nobody got time for that!
*slams toy on the ground* "I hate it here"
SOMEONE PLAY WITH THE FREAKING PUPPY.
I wanna play fetch too!  Somebody play with me
I said awww but not in a cute way....a more disappointed awww. Like "aww nooo some one help him play!"
You god damn monsters
My solution is working in a kennel, I get to bring my dog and he gets to play with all the other puppers and i get to pet him and everyone else
Ill come play fetch 
Please play with me, love dogo
What are these offices with dogs? I would like a dog at my work place. 
Somebody better stop and play with him now. 
Smol girl is the personification of that one comic "no take. Only throw." So I'm jealous and want to play with that dog!

Now I hope you all are thinking of semore now and are sad like me. 
just play with him ffs
This offends my sensibilities; this doggo clearly needs to be played with immediately. 
I can hear the little whimper when they press their nose to the glass...

THROW. THE. TOY.

This is heartbreaking lol
Is this company Kabbage by any chance?
 Would never get any work done
What kind of dog?
This made me sad. Somebody please find this dog and play with him. 
Fck that was too painful to watch. 
SOMEONE THROW THE DAMN TOY!
SAVE HIM
I'm so upset right now... 
While writing my dissertation these past 2 years, my doggo reminded me to take breaks by bringing his ball over to play.  He was truly a sanity saver and always seemed to know when it was a good time.

E: autocorrect sp errors
r/watchdogsdieinside
I think my favorite thing though is the indignant huff at the end. My dog does this all the time when I tell him no to something and will go as far as to make noises like he is talking back to me. I wish there was a subreddit for puppy pouting/ boofy arguments.
PLAY WITH HIM, YOU ASSHOLES!!!
My heart. Muh soul
Lol he threw the toy down like "darn humans take life so serious!"
Just a little time, PLEASE
SOMEONE PLAY FETCH WITH DOG
Gosh damn it!!! Play with the dog!!!
Clearly, someone needs to be hired just to entertain the dog.
"I'm playing with that dog!"

"Dale, get to work!"

"I'm taking a vacation day, you can keep this morning's salary, I'm spending the afternoon in this room!"

Those sad eyes!

what a beautiful dog. it's a shame. dogs are so full of energy!
every office should have a dog
Pets are fun but they don't belong in the office. Unless everyone is okay with me bringing my "service peacock" in as well? Yes it shits everywhere and makes noise constantly, but it makes me feel better...
Office dog?
I want an office dog.  Would rather play fetch than pretend I was working.
Damn savages those hoomans are. 
Fuck work! How could you say no??
This hurts so much.
this belongs on r/yesyesyesyesno

cute dog with toy, nobody plays with it.
To hell with my job, the doggo needs me
It only takes a few minutes to stop and play fetch. It would make his, and your, day much brighter.
Where are all these office dogs? I've yet to walk into an office that has a dog. I really hope for a dog every time.
How do they get any work done with those eyes staring out at them!! 
I... I need to go tell my puppers how much I appreciate her 🐶
Aww cute little face, Ill come play!
Why doesn't my work have an office dog? I'd hate my job way less lol
Our office dog always looks so depressed. Would probably enjoy being at home in the yard more.

That scruffy pup needs a good petting.
Why I haz no office dogg?!?!?!
Why you no throw ball, YOU MONSTER
I would quit my job just to play fetch with this pup.
I would be his bestest friend...
Why get an office dog if no one has time for the poor pupper. This post just made me sad. 
:(
\*frustrated toy drop\*
Awwwooohoohoohoo 😭😭😭😢
I'd happily lose my job to play with that puppy
You have an office dog? Where do you work and how can I apply?
You could suggest he's stuck in a glass box of emotion
If you have an office dog you have to have an office policy that everyone takes turns to play with it, a slight downturn on each person's output during their turn is to be factored in. 
What breed of dog is this?  I must have it
Hello darkness my old friend 
“God damn it Berniece”
Poor doggo. 😭
Me irl

SOMEONE PLAY WITH THAT DOG, YOU MONSTERS. 😢
Looks like it's time to stop working.

"This is bullshit!"
 Even before that the bystander effect has been a thing. 
Ow my heart that poor doggo
Everyone's sad about him dropping his little toy... my heart broke when he booped his snoot on the glass
This? This is not okay. 
My heart! 
Hannibal Woofter

This is why you don't have office dogs. Also, god help your colleagues with allergies. 
Y'all  don't deserve him
You fucking monsters!
If this was my dog, I wouldn’t get any work done. All dog, all the time!
Poor sad doggo 12/10 would play with
Nothing more selfish than bringing an animal to your shit job for 8 hours so you can get attention when you want it then have them sit in a corner for hours barely having anything to do. 
I'm not popular in this opinion, but I hate "office" animals. Not everyone wants an animal at work. If you need to take you dog to work, you should either not have a dog, or not have a job. 
Fuck office dogs.  Gross.
This is heart-wrenching. Just take 20 minutes and play with the damn dog!
You stop working this instance! And go play with that dog, you monster! 
Nobody is THAT busy! Y'all just need to get priorities straight.
You guys he's my puppy and I promise he gets tons of playtime at home: [https://imgur.com/a/G5ODYl7](https://imgur.com/a/G5ODYl7)
It’s alright guys, I’ll take one for the team 
😭 go play with him!!!
Hate people who get a puppy and work full time instead of taking care of them...maybe let a nice family adopt them? 
This is the saddest thing I've seen all year, my heart just broke.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PUT THE CAMERA DOWN AND PLAY FETCH!!!
Haha so funny but seriously go play with that dog right now you monsters
[removed]
Go and play fetch with him right now or I will John Wick everywhere
Someone better go play with that pupper right this instant!
YOU MONSTERS!
What kind of cold, heartless people do you work with??? Who could say no to that pup?
