Anyway, to all the people saying that the oldest cat is 38, I am talking about the oldest **living cat,** which is a different record than the oldest cat that has ever lived.

He makes friends with the animals outside and I once found him at the door rubbing up against an adult possum.LONG LIVE THE KINGContact Guinness.

Are there undesirable symptoms of being such an old catto?Makes me feel young to know that there are cats in this world who are only 2 years younger than I am (33)31 in *human years*. God bless Tiger.I would recommend finding out if he is the oldest cat.  Fox News published this story on  June 4, 2018 about a 30 year old cat.  Tiger might be older.
