I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre not one of the idiots that drive with their dog in their lap while texting and eating their burrito.
I was ready to have words with you.

Someone needs to ride in the back seat and give scritches. I volunteer as tribute.

Great boy.
Honestly super smart. He's probably super comfy and doesn't get jostled around like most dogs do in cars
Super cute and all but I would be terrified of being rear ended.   I also live in so cal so maybe that's indicative of the shitty drivers I deal with on a daily basis. 
I was very mad this morning, got into it with my fianc√©e and now the doggo made me happy and I‚Äôm going to send this to her to make her happy and remember that I love her despite our quarrels and qualms. 
That sort of behaviour is exactly why I want a malamute, they're just such fun dogs
wow, i don't know about this particular trunk, but mine gets damn hot.  (hot to the point that i don't even leave my suitcase in there if i'm traveling a long distance.)

plus, i've been rear-ended too many times to ever carry anything of value in the trunk.
How did you discover he liked it ? 
While that's as adorable as ever, the idea of that car getting rear-ended is kind of terrifying.
Except trunks are crumple zones, so if you get rear ended, that pup is Hamburg. 
Wicked cute but is that safe for him to ride like that?
Where I'm from I'd be worried about the heat for such a fuzzball
You just don‚Äôt want him to ruin the leather 
I don't want to be that guy but I feel obligated to inform you that the trunk of a sedan is the crumple zone of the car and your dog will most certainly be killed if you get into any sort of moderate rear end collision. 

And I rather like your dog so I would not like to see that happen.
[deleted]
Omg I want this dog. I want to hug him. At work. All day. 
[removed]
Cruel to convenient in ten seconds.
What kind of sweetness is this
I have no idea why people are praising this person, in any minor rear end accident above 20 mph that dog is dead, TRUNKS ARE DESIGNED AS CRUMPLE ZONES. 
Not a good spot. Your dog should be tethered in the back seat in a harness.
Cute, but super dangerous. :( If rear ended, trunk crumples. If hit from any other angle while his head is sticking through that hole, or if the car rolls over, could result in serious injury or worse. Best bet is to train and use [doggy seatbelts](https://www.budgetdirect.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/How-to-keep-your-dog-safe-in-the-car.png)!  
Aw. But drive carefully!!! Trunks and hoods are designed to crumple in an accident!
Me as a kid after watching a movie when a man is put in the trunk
they had us in the first half not gonna lie
Wouldn't the dog be seriously injured If an accident happened more so because he/she is in that position
That smile in the end. 
How is this getting so many up-votes and Silver/Gold? This is incredibly stupid and unsafe for that gorgeous dog.
Yup. Put the dog in a crush zone that‚Äôs designed to absorb all the impact. I work in collision repair. The last place anything alive needs to be is in the trunk. 
That‚Äôs not very safe
At first I was like, that‚Äôs no place for a puppy like that do NOT put him in there, then you opened that little door 
That is incredibly dangerous. What happens if you get rear ended (the most frequent type of collision)?
Doggo has got his street smarts. 
"Look, I kidnapped!"
That‚Äôs one heck of a backseat pup holder. But then again, one heck of a pup
Ah so that‚Äôs what the hole in my trunk is for. 
I love this dog.
Until you get rear ended
Looks dangerous what if you get rear ended?
Don't get rear ended doggie
Cute, but incredibly unsafe for your dog, especially if someone were to rear end you...

Please put your pupper's safety before reddit karma.
This is adorable but I'd still be paranoid about some rear ending me
What car is it?
Precious floofer!
‚ÄúSir, what‚Äôs in the trunk‚Äù
Dude I was about to be so angry 
My worry is if you get rear ended
That's the crush zone of a car.
May I please hug your dog? I wantz to hugz that face!
seems unsafe but adorable 
Just more evidence that Huskies are cat software running on dog hardware. 
looks dangerous AF in an accident
That‚Äôs a crumple zone. If you get rear ended by anything your dog will die and in a pretty horrific almost-empty-toothpaste-tube way. It‚Äôll be a cleanup.

Don‚Äôt do this.
This is super cute but please don‚Äôt transport your pooch in a trunk. Trunks are crumple zones, and if your vehicle gets rear-ended with a decent amount of force ol doge is getting crumpled too
I‚Äôd be absolutely terrified of being rear ended or some asshole stopping short in front of me. 
Really hope you take him out of there before actually driving. 100% dead if anyone rear ends you at speed in the trunk. Cant believe all you people saying this is super smart... this is super dangerous.
Aaah!His little fluffy head poofing out of the middle part is adorable!IM gonna sit back there and give him so many scritches!
"Favorite spot"

Nice try, Mitt Romney. 
hi, not trying to be morbid or a busybody but I think you should still keep your dog in the passenger area, as thats where all the crash safety stuff is. If you are rear ended with a lot of speed,your trunk is most likely gonna crumble.

Last year I was rear ended at 60 mph and my trunk was even pushed into my passengers seat. My dog was in the back seat and even there he was almost crushed up against the back of the front seats. All the Christmas presents I had in the trunk we're crushed beyond any recovery; I sincerely cannot imagine the horror if my dog were in the trunk at the time.
But the trunk is what collapses if your rear ended.... 
Sounds like a great idea until you realize that if you ever get rear-ended, your dog is going to be dead.... There are no airbags in the trunk. there is in fact, basically nothing to protect your trunk in the event of a rear-end collision
Cute and all, unless you get rear ended. 
We all know the dog is shut in there to save the cars leather interior. He does not seem to love the idea of being shut in there. Just looks cute when his head pokes out. Mostly just because he IS cute.
It‚Äôs a rubby cubby 
Don't do this! If you get rear ended he is not gonna be in a safe spot! 
Every single post on Reddit with pets in cars turns into a lecture-fest. Please enjoy the dog and mind your own business. 
I'm going to have a good day thanks to this gif.
My dog can fit trhu that hole lol

I just sit him at front with one of those straps that click on the belt thing.
We honestly don't deserve dogs, they are the epitome of happiness 
So cute!
My life is now complete. 
Loving all the floof! 
r/nonoyes
I need one

*Immediately*
OMG, he's a beautiful boy!!
I‚Äôm just curious to how this position first came about?

As much as it seems comfortable, I just can‚Äôt think of the thought process that lead to this...
WHAT A GOOD BOY
My dog did the opposite the other day. He hates riding in the car. I put him in the back seat and he crawled through the port into the trunk then turned around like that! He‚Äôs a 65lb Boxer!
What a Goofy Poofy
10/10 would ride in the back with that pupper for days
I am waiting for more videos of OP with the dog... Hah... Such floof... I don't know what I would have done if I had such an awesome pet..... Dogs are true love...... 
I‚Äôm getting itchy just thinking of all the dog hair that‚Äôs trapped in the trunk.. loll
What kind of dog is that? 
I love how he gets in, then turns around to tell you that you forgot to open his window after finding it closed and is like "but mom/dad, the window is closed!" as the trunk is shut, and stays facing that way until the window is opened.
Hell no. I'd be so anxious of someone rear ending me.
I was worried when they closed the trunk too! But when I saw that head, too cute and fluffy! 
You can‚Äôt shut your dog in the....! AWWWWWWWW
At first: Good Lord, oh no. Then: Awwwwwww
My heart is melted
Omg when his head sticks through the backseat though üòçüòç
All the fun of being in the car with none of that climate control huskies hate
What kind of dog is that?? üòÅüòÑ
What a doofus.
Hey did anyone else say the trunk is a crumple zone, I may have missed it :P
My favorite spot as a kid, too!! Load up a small bag of snacks, pop down the middle seat of a rental car, and I'm in kid heaven.
This is probably the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Also a bit dangerous now that I think about it 
Might be comfier because it‚Äôs cooler in the trunk then in the human compartment. Stupid hairless humans and their temp control. 
Yeah that's still incredibly dangerous. The trunks of cars are often crumple zones which means they crumple easily upon impact so if you get rear ended you're looking at a dog pancake.
That's a dangerous place for your dog to be in the event you're rear ended 
not very safe if rear ended, bet he would be just as happy in the back seat, if you cant tolerate pets on your fancy seats you should reconsider your values and what is important to you
It's super super cute. But also incredibly dangerous. It only takes one idiot to ruin your dog's life.
Yeah until you get rear ended ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Wow that is a beautiful dog though 
Still seems dangerous. But you don‚Äôt get authentic cute/dangerous much these days - I‚Äôm still satisfied 
Its all fun and games until they get rear-ended, then that fun little peek-a-boo portal becomes a playdoh press of nightmares.
Fake. Dog was trained to do that. 
What if you got rear ended?
I'm going to guess they're protecting their backseats by risking the dogs safety if they get rear ended. 
Maybe so.  It's adorable and I've done that before, but if you get rear ended I hate to think what would happen to your dog.  Pets should ride in carriers or harnessed in like people in case there is an accident.  Just sayin'
‚ÄúHis‚Äù referring to her husband who‚Äôd rather not have dog hair and scratches on those beautiful leather seats. 
Will your dog marry me? 
Ah yes the ol' car crumple zone. Just kind of collapses in in itself when rear ended.
If that last scene with outlet was not there, people would be so angry 
I hope you never get rear ended. Because he is literally in the crumble zone
Crumple zone of car not exactly the safest place to put your pet.
My fucking god that is cute
He protec 
He attac
But most importantly he gets in the back
Paging u/2020kb
AHHHH üòçso much floof!

Oh my fecking god, good job on 2,000,000 karma
Sorry but this is a big fat ticket in NJ.
r/unexpected
It's cute and all, but damn does that seem like a horrible position to be in during an accident.

Everyone has already said the obvious about the rear being a crumple zone, but there is no angle that an accident can happen from that ends well for this pup's neck.
More vehicles should come equipped with great riding buddies.
Stares glaring with lighter and torch *slowly removes thumb from lighter*
Our smaller dog used to love riding in the boot with the lid closed. She jumped in once and wouldn't get out so my dad shut the boot and opened the middle seat like in the video for her to get through, but she was content sleeping in the dark. After a while we put a spare bed in for her to curl up on and she was happy for suitcases and things to be packed round her, so long as she was the first thing to go in. Always wondered what people must have thought of us when we arrived at a caravan site, pulled three cases out and then a small dog emerged from the back yawning. 
My heart rate is still a little elevated from the mad on I'd built up until the end.
Seeing him off leash as that car zooms by was scary
Doesn't it get very hot back there with no air conditioning and that thick fur?
Wtf if the car gets rear ended?
Nothing like keeping a loved one in the crumple zone. 
Cute but seriously hope you don‚Äôt get rear ended :(
Like, your not supposed to put anything alive in the trunk. If that car gets rear-ended bye bye puppy. 0 protection. Backends are now designed to crumple. 
Do not do this. In the event of an accident the truck is the crumple zone meaning it's there to absorb as much of the impact as possible before transferring it forward. Please don't endanger anyone by letting them ride in the trunk. 
Not safe 
r/MadeMeSmile
Dogs are the best.
Love that derpy smile when he puts his head thru the arm rest opening. ü§£
Hehehe. The cutest of good bois ‚ò∫Ô∏è
In the section of the car that's designed to collapse in a collision.
I want a pup holder in my car too
I'm worried about someone rear-ending you üôÅ
Isn't it hot in the trunk? 
Until you hit a pothole and your dog fucking dies.
Please don't do this.  It's cute, until you consider that the trunk is a crumple zone.  Even if you don't belt your pets (I don't either) they are safer in the passenger cabin.  
What if you got rear ended?
Please don't do this. Trunks are crumple zones. Your dog would be much safer properly secured in the cabin of your car than in a trunk. 
Please don't drive that way. If you have an accident your pet will die & nobody wants your fluffy friend to die.
Very bad idea. The trunk is a crumple zone, if you get rear-ended with your puppet in the trunk, he‚Äôs gonna get squished. Buy him a harness and let him ride in the cabin!
Untill the car gets rear ended
Oh lord he's in a crumple zone though, if they get rear-ended...
This isn‚Äôt safe... imagine if they get rear ended.. 
Sick subwoofers
Trunk is designed as a crumple zone. He‚Äôs dead in a severe rear end accident. Passenger safety compartment is better. Would never put my dog in the trunk. The gas tank is immediately below in my car.
If you want to have your dog die if you get into a car accident, then this is how you do it. 

Trunks are crumpling zones, if you get rear ended the dog could die. 
One guy I went to college with had a doberman dog who was killed this way by being rear ended by a dodge pickup. He had a Grand Prix and the rear end was flattened. I remember seeing the photo where you can just see blood leaking from the trunk seams. 
This is the official way to start my day that I wanted
That‚Äôs one way to keep the dog hair down!
I bet it's nice and cool in the trunk - look at all the fluff!
Along comes a cop.... "OMG A SEVERED DOG HEAD!"
My husky used to do this too. I miss Tex EDIT- picture https://imgur.com/gallery/HEKfgQ7

This is funny to see because we have a malamute mix that loves hanging out in confined spaces.  She used to spend all day in the back of my jeep while I worked.  I‚Äôd leave the window part of the back gate up and she would chill all day.  We got new cars and won‚Äôt let her hang out in them now so she hangs out in a closet or the tub.  Funny to see another malamute with similar preferences.  
I strongly advise against keeping a pet in the trunk like that. The trunk serves as a crumble zone in case of a collision. Even a low speed collision, say 20 mph, which would not hurt anyone inside the car, could completely crush the trunk compartment. 

So being rear ended at a stoplight, or even having a pick up truck not notice your car and back into it at the shopping mall, could critically injure your dog. 
I hate to be the buzz kill.. its cute..

 But car accident wise this is really unsafe
Bad spot to put your dog. The trunk is meant to collapse in an accident to absorb impact. If you got seriously rear-ended, there would be nothing to protect the dog. Look up ‚Äúcrumple zone.‚Äù
I thought this was gonna he like an animal abuse vid and he was just gonna shut him in there but then I saw the rest
Weird, this was my favorite spot when traveling in college too.

Edit: I am not a dog; only a mere man.
[deleted]
I'm sure he'd like the back seat a lot more if you let him sit up there.
Good boi
Very smart pupper
If I did this in my friend's car, all they would think is that in weird...

Every little movement he makes is adorable. 
It‚Äôs his little travel cave.  Awesome!
yes yes yes yes YES
Smart dog! The trunk probably feels nice and cool while his human has the heat on in the front. Furs get hot!
This makes me think of the clip Markiplier made with Chica: "Boat Dog". But instead "TRUNK Dog". 
SAVE
This made me audibly gasp when his head popped out.
Backseat luxuries
My favorite spot too
Cutest thing I've ever seen
Soooo cute
When traveling with my cat, I used to put her litterbox in the trunk with the back seat door open. She loved to sit in the back window while driving, but would walk through to the trunk to do her business.

Miss that cat.  My current cat is adorable but stupid and I have to lock her into a carrier every time we travel. 
Attention automakers...
Beautiful dog
Awww ü•∞ sweet pupper... loves going byes ‚ù§Ô∏è
My dad puts ours in the boot with no openings. 
Cutest thing I‚Äôve seen my entire life...
What kind of dog is that?
Wait until you hit a bump!
I thought he liked to be in trunk but then he come in to seats from a little opening in the middle seat

Consider a hatchback the next time you buy a car! Being able to lay the back seats down and open up that cargo area makes dog travel a dream! 
Omg
I don't even like dogs and this is amazing 
haha this is genius! 
First I was like isn't that cruel/unsafe? Then I was all ohhhh awwww.

Malamute or husky...? What are the differences?
Can your dog fit his whole body through the arm rest hole? If not I don't see this being safe if you were in an accident, especially rear ended not considering car catching fire as that is less common
That‚Äôs going to be really bad if you get in a fender bender.

That's super cute. I hope you never get rear ended while he's with you though.
Guillotines are fun and comfortable. Until the blade drops.
As cute as this is my only thought is that the pet is inside of a crumple zone.

‚ÄúWHERE WE GOIN‚Äô?!?‚Äù
Very sweet

And here we see the rare car bear in his natural environment, where he will take many naps and give happy smiles the other local wildlife. Truly a beautiful specimen. 
Anyone know what kind of pupper this is? 
Honestly id do this just to keep the dog hair in one general area
Is that safe?
That sad look in the beginning and the happiness look at the end <3 

I would just worry of my babies if an accident happened >~< Be safe you wonderful Pupper! üíú
Don't get ready ended
This has to be one of the cutest dogs I have ever seen.
Aww! What a cutie! 
You just gave everyone a heart attack.
My little doggo was much smaller and made his own Little apartment while traveling...
Will they really lock him in the trunk? ... thank god, they didn‚Äôt 
Me as a kid after watching a movie when a man is put in the trunk
Derp derp who‚Äôs a good boy?
My golden used to love this! He got all muddy on a hike once so we put him in the trunk and folded one of the seats down and from then on that was his favorite spot in the car 
Omg I‚Äôm having a shit week... instead of having a good cry I just looked at this gif over and over for a long time and it really cheered me up! Thanks OP! 
I wonder if someone could develop a harness and safety piece that fits in the trunk for this purpose.
How adorable.
Fluffo go too!!!
It's still a doggie prison.
Bizarrely cute
Seeing this on 9GAG in 3,2, 1...
ITS TO WHOLESOME

This is how we'd do road trips with my little brother. 
How'd they learn that without bring randomly put in the trunk.  My dog has no idea the trunk even exists.
Perfect

He‚Äôs already panting . Dumb
Awwwwwwwwwwwwww-inspiring.  :-)
Happy doggo means a happy person!
This looks familiar! My grandma would put my sister and I in the trunk with the backseat divider lowered for long car trips when we were very young.
Trunks are crumple zones in a lot of cars, this makes me really nervous. 

Edit: so glad other people have said it too so I am not (yet again) the Debbie downer of the post. 
I think he's learnt to have that spot, gotta look after the leather 
This malamute is so fluffy I can't handle it.
Now THAT is a goddamn doggie door
I have to assume he was kennel trained
That dog has the life!
This is actually the only thing I've found on here that made me audibly aww while giggling. 
That's the cutest thing I've ever seen.

Dude that‚Äôs a dog version of my cat.
I love this. 
Dude me too 
Aww sweet doggo
I was just thinking ‚Äúho no it‚Äôs cute but he‚Äôs in the truck... OMG HE‚ÄôS SO CUTE with his head coming out!‚Äù
Seemed so mean until I watched the whole video , then I just laughed lol
Adorable goofball.
That's such a good boy!
I feel like this can only be in Canada or colder areas of the states. If we put one of these furrier dogs (I think this one is a Husky or Malamute) in our trunk in Australia, especially at the moment, even with that little opening in the middle seat ... Yeah our poor doggos wouldn't survive the heat in there. :(

But this is super adorable though!! :3
What a silly floof!! I just want to pet and shake that face (in a non-scary way) üòÇ 
That is a beautiful dog!
Looks like this dog has done this before
I love him
"Fetch me their souls"
What breed is this dog? Too cute!!! 
what a fur on that large boi. very nice.
After seeing this, it's my new spot in the car as well
That happy grin at the end. Be still, my heart.
This was...... **TOO FREAKING ADORABLE üíï**
Why would you lock him in the.....dude that‚Äôs the best!!!
Awww
I'm in love @.@
I can smell that car
This is interesting if only all car has that kind of boots 
Haha
My, that's one hell of an arctic dumb dumb ya got there. Your gonna wanna nuzzle that fine boy whilst making a high pitch squeal. Just in case.
Ah yes, kidnap me Hooman
