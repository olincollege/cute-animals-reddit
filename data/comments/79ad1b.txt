 ‚ÄúThere will be NO brothers and sisters...I will not allow it!‚Äù
My son does the opposite. If were not holding hands, he grabs a hand of ours each and drags them together.
This is MY daddy.  Find your own. 
Don‚Äôt worry mom,  in 13-14 years she‚Äôll grow to hate the both of you. 
If my 5 year old daughter sees me and my wife kissing, she throws a huge fit and runs out of the room. Not for me, she doesn't like anybody else kissing her mommy. 
Our baby does this too!  

If one of us is feeling smothered by the baby(she will roll around and use her body as a ‚Äúshield‚Äù) we reach for another person, usually parent or sister, and say ‚Äúmine.‚Äù  Most of the time she will detach and go smother that person. 
This is legitimately my son with my wife. I'll snuggle up to her and he'll be like "The fuck off my mom!" 
I like to pick up my baby and tell my toddler "My baby!"  He'll then chase me around the house saying "No, *my* baby!" as I run away laughing and carrying her.  
That's my man, bitch
"Sorry, but this belongs to me."
Already a little, adorable asshole.
My dog does this. If my hubs and I try to cuddle. He'll get off his bed and shove his self between us.

Get your BITCH ASS hand off my man
This is called parenting. The little shits don‚Äôt understand what is sharing. At stages me and my wife are not allowed talk to each other just to the baby
Your child is already tearing your marriage apart
Hah. Yeah young children are petty as hell. 

Source: have two young children.
That‚Äôs the most Freudian baby ever
awww lol thats so nice for daddy and so sad for mommy
Girls love their dads. I have a 4 year old and when i get home she wants nothing to do with her momma. 
Moms have it rough. 
I miss so much when my daughter used to do this..
Aw.... Dad's girlüíïüíï
My nephew was this way with my sister and I. He hated when we'd sit next to eachother. We'd hug and he'd try to rip us apart. It was funny. 
"Have kids they said... it'll be fun they said" xD
I'm sure r/daddit would love this
He doesn‚Äôt even react anymore. 
I used to do the same thing with my younger brother when he was this age. Although I did it consistently just to piss him off and amuse the rest of our family. Ah good ole' times at the expense of the youngest family member
On her way to steal your man.


Freud was right? 
Apparently at some event when I was 3/4 my grandfather had the GALL to go say hi to a family friend‚Äôs new baby. My mom says I very calmly walked over to him, looked at the baby dismissively, took him by the hand, and lead him back to our table. Children are green-eyed little monsters. 
At this age my daughter would gentle rub the underside of my wife's arm while breastfeeding. I would try and offer my arm as a substitute but she would grab my hairy arm and push it away in disgust every time. Amazing how these little people know exactly what they need.
R/animalsbeingjerks
These kind of jokes might not age well..
Friendship ended with that hand, this hand is now my best frien
Elektra complex
Bitch I'm not old enough to have siblings, maybe you can start holding hands again in a year.
When I noticed the title the only thing I could think of is a drunk Nancy in the bathroom, with Steve, at Tina‚Äôs party
kids and their bullshit...Sometimes this behavior last into adulthood.
I did not, o hi Mark 
That right there is a big part of why I'm not having any.  I cherish the rare sleepy mornings we both have off on the same day.  No shitty little toddler is fucking with my snuggle time.
Haha yeah but kids don't ruin intimacy at all. 
Something something Electra complex
Kids are the worst
That‚Äôs just adorable 
The kid already needs to learn how to share üòÇ
This is me, my boyfriend, and his dog. üòÜ
She‚Äôs his girl now. You‚Äôre obsolete. My baby girl does this to me sometimes too. 
Haha, my son does this. If me or my gf show any affection he tries to get between us and compete for it. His mom will say "I'm gonna go kiss dad!" And he'll say "No!" And run to me and kiss me. 

You'd think by the age of 20 he'd have cut that shit out..... jk he's 2 lol.
Someone reverse this gif to make it look like she's a cute little match maker 
Kids are such little psychos. :)
Wait. Who's perspective is the title in?
one person's aww is another person's this is why I won't procreate.
Women start hating each other at a very young age.
I keep TELLIN you, bitch...Hands off my man!
Oh HEEELLLL NAAAW
In the same boat with my daughter (13 months).  She wont let me touch my  wife at all.
My Son does the exact same thing, but only if I try to get near my wife lol
My niece does this! Also when having conversation with another person while playing with her, she‚Äôll say ‚ÄúStop talking and play with me!‚Äù Lol little brat 
Used to be really good friends with this guy and his Twitter is blowing up right now. They're talking about making a YouTube channel because of this video.
"Bitch, I gave birth to you!"
This really just says so much.  It's a stage of development many get stuck in by no fault of their own.  Attachment is a precarious thing.
My daughter does the same thing and throws a fit if we don't stop touching.
My ol lady and I have two boys, 2 and 6, and if we try to show each other affection guaranteed one of them isn't allowing it...and we have 2 dogs that do the same thing. So yeah, no hugs for us.....but we do at times do ot where they can see us but not stop us and torture them til they cry lol
"Bitch I was here first" - mom probably
My 2 year old flips out if my husband hugs me and screams "My mommy! Not yours!"
This reminds me of a picture someone put up on Twitter. When a girls boyfriend picks up her niece, the niece turns around to make sure the girl is watching. 
My 14 month twin girls will scream and claw at me if I so much as sit next to their mom on the couch. 
Stranger Things 2 spoilers, much?
Awe..... I have a baby like this, that goes in territorial mode....üòä
Babies are their own birth control. Too tired to fool around and they make sure they get all the attention. 
Little psycho in the making hahaha
You tiny, adorable asshole. 
My 4 year old daughter still does this shit. She ran out of the room crying when my wife gave me a back rub today. 
Can someone put this in reverse? 
Freud has a thing or two to say about this.
Proving self-centeredness and selfishness are nature's gifts to us.  üòÄ
Why does this make me angry?
Babies don't belong on aww 
You gotta punch that baby in the mouth

Hand holding in front of a child? PERVERTS!
It‚Äôs the same thing with my daughter and her mom... she actively takes my hand away jealous as hell. 
I feel bad for the female friends of her high school boyfriend.
Like father,


Like son
me when my friends get into relationships
Why does everyone assume the baby is a girl?
That's cause dads are the BEST!
/u/catsfurlife69
The best part was the baby didn't even care about the dad's hand before that pt
Is there a reason for this? Why does the baby do this? Because I've read the comments about people's babies getting sad/annoyed/"jealous" of there parents holding hands, kissing etc. Is there a reason for this or are babys crazy protective?
My dog is like this, I havent enjoyed human company in years :/

Hes very protective, i love it.
Everyone who meets him
Loves him and 
Pets him, he 

Mostly just licks
Everybody and everything please God 
You, you have been babyzoned
That little look she gives when she moves her hand back
I expected a "I did not hit her" with that title.

Enjoy your time and relish it! They grow SO fast and are out on their own before you know it...put them before your work and be the mentor they need.  Never forget their eyes are ALWAYS on you.  
^mobile^^now^^^has^^^^superscript
I remember when my daughter was super possessive and would push my wife and I apart if she ever saw us hugging. Now she just wants me to stay out of her room.
The kid knows what she wants
I'm starting to understand why all children's cartoons end with a valuable lesson about friendship and caring.

Gross. Humans have no business on this sub.
That seems like such a nice scene. I used to have mornings like that with my young wife and infant daughter. Cherish them, they can change in the blink of an eye. Now I live alone with my dog on the other side of the country and these are just memories. 
I want to know why they have a full duvet on the bed and are covered up, and have a fan running?  As someone who has been sweltering in a heat wave recently, I'm so confused!
In Spain this is called (and forgive if the spelling is incorrect) Papatin.

this is what happens after 9 months + lmao..

Wasn‚Äôt having none of that shit lol
*post Freudians collectively recognizing what‚Äôs going on here* 
Interesting. My nephew does this to me when I try and take him from my sister his mom. One time he was in a shopping cart and I tried to push him and he kept trying to pull my hands off the card. It was kind of funny. When his daddy tries to take him from Mommy he's just kind of indifferent. He'd rather stay with her but he'd also rather be held. 
Exactly my words every time my dog does this to me. Biggest block when it comes to cuddles, kisses...pretty much anytime she isn‚Äôt getting boyfriend‚Äôs attention 
No! Dis is mine!
Dear god, Freud was right this whole time :S
Lt. Daniel's baby is cute as hell.
GTFO BITCH! it's my daddy hand

Imagine if a puppy ran into frame at the end! So much r/awwwwwww 
I know kids feel this way. I just didn't know it happened **this** young. Is that baby even a year old?
Man I love having a kid and appreciating the weird things they do, and I also love seeing others parents‚Äô kids doing weird, hilarious shit as well.
*everything that was once yours is mine now*
If it's not the kids, it's the dog. 
I read that babies actually do try to stop their parents from being intimate. They do so out of instinct to remove competition
sorry mom
this seems to be played backwards
I give this post about one more hour before its first on front page. 
Why would you name the baby that!?
Never thought I'd see this for dad.
Budding Electra complex!
"like we're in love"
Can confirm, this happens. 

If I hug my wife, over comes running my nearly 2 year old to break us apart.

If we hug her together she pushes me away.

If we hold hands, she does the above.

If we plan to do the dirty in the bed...she wakes up crying.
awwwwww
So, OP, where did you repost this from?

DERIVATIVE!

BULLSHIT!

BULLSHIT!

Now i feel so damn lonely. This kid has a better life than me haha

There's something Freudian about this
They call her Electra

Yo can I get a thug life edit in dis shit? 
Steve and Nancy?
Aw hehe
This is so interesting why do some babies do this but some join in when their parents are hugging. Does anyone know if it has something to do with the way they were raised up until that point or some other reason? Im thinking its because they've bonded more with one parent than the other? 
Something envy something something Freud
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen for ages.

That my daddy. Not your daddy... OK
Baby - "I don't want that."

Adult - "I want that"

Baby "Let go of that. I want that. This is mine." 
for some reason I thought this gif was about 1 year old crawled up to me, smacked me in the bathroom, with Steve, at Tina‚Äôs party
are we not gonna talk about how theres 3 people in that bed not including the baby
I don't know why you are in the hospital, but I hope you get better for the little one's sake.
Unfitting caption
When my (ex) boyfriend & I would hold hands, my dog would jump through to break the handholding. Pretty sure he had a crush on my (ex) boyfriend.
She‚Äôs gonna steal your man watch out
This isn‚Äôt funny or cute at all. This made me angry. 
freud was right
edit: i'm a dumbass
Good way to make your kid into a bossy brat. They start learning these things early. It's cute now. Won't be so cute when they're 16.
What I always find the most interesting about children is how long it takes for them to take actions.  

It's even more interesting as they learn language, their prosody is completely different (faster) than it will be.

But this child's speed at removing the hand is much faster and more decisive than any adult.  :)

So interesting! 
Oedipus in action.

My daughters and female dog do the same thing to my wife whenever she gets cocky enough to make physical contact with me.  I would probably be the unwanted gringo if we had boys.
I remember when we took in our niece when she was an infant. Was in college worrying about buying formula, diapers, and food for her. Came from a low income household which put even more stress on us. Both her parents were dead beat parents. I teared up a little when she called me papa Eric.  
This is literally oedipus complex
She is exhibiting early signs of bitchin'! 
Oedipus complex has begun 
"You had your time when you were making me, this is my time."
Electra complex in action.
Ohhh good ole oedipus complex 
Electra complex much?
WT Hell did I just see? 

Was that real? 

Soooo adorable!!!

When babies are possessive its cute, when I do it I'm an asshole and get a restraining order? What kind of double standard is this shit? 
Lol awesome!! That bond right there is worth more than anything in the whole world.
Electra complex
That somehow makes me sad. Also, the guy didn't even smile. Did he even notice?
Daddy's little girl. 
I dated a girl when my niece was 1 and 1/2. We're sitting on the couch together and she deliberately got in between us then "pretended" to drop her bottle hard on the girls leg. Lol. That was a sign, the girl turned out to be crazy, and got fat. She saved me.
/r/mensrights is leaking
This is my daughter too! Little beast!
My son did that to my ex husband whenever he tried to cuddle me. He even pushed our faces away when we would kiss on occasion. My son ended up being super territorial with me. 
The smell of Freud. 
I'm a 28 year old man with no kids. This made me tear up and smile HARD. 
Awwww look at that cute little Oedipus Complex. 
This is my favorite post on this subreddit!
If hubs and I had another baby and it was a girl, this would be her. Haha 

MomOfThreeBoys
This is the most adorable video I have seen in a very long time. Yes, she is Daddy's girl! My heart goes out to Mom though. She is also a beautiful little girl! Always be proud! 
As a father of two 'daddy's girls' - that is awesome. 
The first time my little girl held my hand, my heart completely melted. That and when she runs into my arms the moment I walk in the door. She is absolutely the best part of my day. 
This is exactly how my daughter behaves but with our dog
I just told my wife to be prepared for this type of shit from my 3 month old daughter. She's got me wrapped around her finger, for sure. 
Hands off bitch, he‚Äôs spoken for!

"Dis my Daddy now, you better call him something else"
Hhh. She takes the place of her mother lol
Step off my man, bitch.
I want to see the dad‚Äôs reaction! I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs as precious as his child 
Normally I hate posts with him an babies. Normally I hate the people that make the exception I'm making now.

But this is really cute. 
thata was so cute
this is truly excellent.
My boyfriend (and best friend) just sent this to me and said, "This will be me if we break up, and you date anyone else."
Why is the fan on.  If you're hot don't use the covers
This has to bee the cutest thing I've seen all day.
Aww that is MY daddy
"DON'T TOUCH MY DADDY! HE IS MINE"!
My son used to do this in my truck. I'd put my arm around my wife and he'd get super pissed and pull my hand off.
This is too freakin cuuute!
This is the cutest thing I have seen in my life! 
Oh goodness... I hope this isn't the beginning of daddy issues lol
Girls come out causing drama ;) 
Yep...i live this everyday. Except my 1 year old decides im not allowd to touch my wife.
My daughter used to do the same thing
Damn it now I want a baby 
i once read about a female 	Oedipus complex where the daughter wants the father. just had to think of that.EDIT its called electra complex

Isn't this the daddy daughter complex by Feurd?
When I held my daughter she would do this to her extremely narcissitic mother. Mom (now my ex) accused me of turning our daughter against her.

This should be concrete, conclusive evidence that men make better parents, unless the unseen person is also a man, in which case men make better parents than other men
