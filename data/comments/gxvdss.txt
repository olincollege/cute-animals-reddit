Dog internally: oh no.. oh no... ohhhh OHH okay.
T-Rex stance
10 yr later....dogs doing underwater training on how to walk on 2 legs with humans :)
Could you train a dog to be bipedal by training them in the pool?
Everyone gangsta till the dog starts water-walking
Probably feels so good for a dog that has always wanted to be more human to be able to stand with less pressure on its hips.
Original, way better quality:

His face :3
Oh, i love this
If only Jack knew he could stand in the water in Titanic.
This is a good dog trainer, to get that kind of rapt attention from a multitasker like our good boi here. Keep pushing your dogs it's good for their brains to be challenged!
WHAT THE HECK
Life as he knew it had changed.  lmao!!!
Meerkat dog
r/curledfeetsies
"Well this is easier.."
Me when I lose my bikini top in the pool
my english mastiff used to do this! I remember the thrill/anxiety of her jumping in the pool after me... great memories!
He said 🦖
His face of just pure displeasure
.... Game Changer
You have a pet kangaroo?
Evolution at work. Now will he pass it on to his pups.  Exact reason why we are bipedal...we were once aquatic apes hence upright walking and no hair.
*paw paw* 

*step step*
I wish my border would swim.
BEHOLD, A MAN!
Now I does human walkies.
God he just looks SO FUCKING POLITE
We have all been there.
Damn, he vibin now
Future rogue scientists will cite this video for the first stage of aquatic canine evolution.
His face is priceless
“My life is a lie!” - dog
Good boyant.
“And now, we observe a wild Doggosaurus Rex in it’s natural habitat. Nature sure is a beauty.”
He has become bipedal.
Oh no. They're evolving
He looks like cartoon characters when they try to be discrete
That's how they learn how to walk.
That's a weird lookin' T-Rex.
I love his little front paws!
"There goes my immersion" - Dog, probably.
"You wanna catch these hands?"
Good buoy!
He’s like “Hey look at me, I’m a human!”
Dog.
"and this is my other Tyrannosaur impression"
Is this the vid where Jurassic bark came from!?
Hey guys look, look i’m a human. Look look i’m a goofy biped
Now I'm really curious if human bipedal movement could've been influenced / accelerated by wading through water...
This may well be one of the cutest things ever! His front paws! I can’t even!
that was treat induced!
I love this!
I too have a golden. That doesn't like the water!😳
All the dinosaurs feared the T-Rex
The dinosaurs in beyond the trees looking at that weird rock in the sky getting bigger and bigger for some reason
This is me in most pools. I'm not a huge fan of bodies of water mostly because I don't float. Lucky I'm fairly tall and unless it's diving side my head stays well above water.
At this very moment, doggo has found out something AMAZING.
Aww how cute
I love his face
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Doggosauras
“All dinosaurs fear the T-Rex.”
He's like screw doggie paddling!
I am hooman, derp derp derp derp.
I walk now human
What a cute & beautiful dog; warms my heart.
K, somebody bring me a beer.
lmaoooooo he looks so dang cute  😭
So much cuteeeee
This is why they call this subreddit Aww😻
All I have to say is nooo way! So super awesome maybe I can teach my husky that. Thanks for sharing!
This is my exact approach to the effort I put in at work
I have never seen a retriever look so unhappy in the prescence of water....
We had a dog that was a lazy swimmer and learned she could walk on the bottom of the pool. My dad bumped her into the lake one hiking trip and she couldn’t touch the bottom. He had to jump in to save her because she was drowning trying to touch the bottom. Super scary!
He looks like a freakin t-rex its hilarious lol.
I love him
Arite well thats the cutest fuckin thing I’ve seen all day
That look on his face is just. O_O
Whenever my dog tries to swim she bites the water. If she attack first water can't hurt her.
I had headphones on and this syncs perfectly to Arcade Fire- Peter Pan no matter how many time u press replay. It's like that spider man gif.
Omg I feel like you could use this to help a dog strengthen the muscles needed to do this outside of the water and then have a humanoid dog!
Help me homan I’m sinkin oh I’m ok I’m a tall boi
He’s a good buoy
Upright boi
Idk how this dog keeps his paddle paws from moving.
"All years of academy training wasted!"
Dog :why did i swam the whole time and spent energy on it🐶
Precious t-rex boy
that doggo just be like "what sorcery is this?! oh.... okay"
What a good bouy
RIP that pool liner
I’ve seen this a hundred times but I will always stop scrolling to watch thank you
This is evolved intelligence I swear
Bro he’s literally just vibing
With all that’s going on in the world, your input is to repost a gif of dog in a pool? Ok.
The day you realize the only why to beat the game is to stop playing by their rules.
I've seen this so many times, but it's great every time
Aww squirrel dog
He's adorable ♥️
this is the main reason i miss having a pool
!remindme 4h
Lol reminds me of my lazy girl she would walk around drinking the pool water. Miss her and helicopter tail.
Looks like some creepy cgi character from Skyrim
Why does this give me Michael Jackson vibes
It’s beautiful. He is gud boi.
This little adjustment strokes.
Smart boyyy
He looks like an otter 🦦😯
the look on his face is adorable.  It's like oooooooh well this is nice isn't it. (in my head its said in a British accent)
Ayy lmao XD
Either that, or it could be fake
cheeky!!
[Reminds me of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1XSUQD2c8w)
See also: Me at 6 years old.
Now all he needs is thumbs.
EUREKA!!!🐶
Kangarog
You just discovered a new species of kangaroo
^("Human, what are you doing to me")
https://youtu.be/emiZpSuz-eA
Does he go to the bathroom in the pool?
He looks like my granny holding her bag on the Sunday outing 😂
This is great!!
They’re...they’re evolving...
This is me
all heck the mighty D-rex
If I had gold to give!
That face. "My life has changed forever"
Dinodog
Relaxy boi
That boy got skills
Game-changer...
We now know their next purchase was an underwater camera.
"I have mastered this element, Master. How will you challenge me next?"
He looks like the cutest dino. 
Rawr xD
This is how the canines evolved into a bipedal species
looks like me at the 5' part of the pool (i'm 5'2). i understand pupper; i understand.
Wow what a breakthrough for that doggo. I’m happy for him.
Omgggg
he said 👁👄👁
Pupposaurus-rex
Oh nice dog
😂
Rex. From fallout new Vegas.
Ahhh ahh ... oooh ohh this is nice very nice.
Oh dish ish much easiers!
I like how he keeps his little mouth flaps folded up to keep water from splashing in his mouth 😆❤️❤️❤️
Mom look i’m a t-rex!!!
He walked like a dinosaur
This is how Planet of the Dogs gets started...
Pretty soon he'll be walking around the house like that. You'll do a double take, and he'll just say "Hey, howya doin'" and keep right on walking.
My Goldens would make that same face as they’d wait for a tennis ball to be thrown.    
“Do it......come on.......DO IT!”
Mini T-Rex!
So swett
I wonder if dogs also pee in pools.
Ah, I am human now.
This dog is pushing forward the canine playerbase. Maybe one day they will have dexterity to allow for tool use, that would shake up the tierzoo outside meta.
/u/nicebus
Omg
Why are his hands so funny to me
u/redditdownloader
God I can't stand the idea of realpolitik.
Me, lol
# Hyuman! I hav evolved!

# I walking on two Legs too now!
Sweet boy
He’s got life figured out.
:0 i am human
Dammit! I tried to teach my dog how to do this as a kid...

His ass would buoyancy back on up to the water line
The happiness I needed!
This is exactly what my dog does and then he gets stuck :(  Then we have to go lift his bag legs off the ground so he keeps swimming.  Life jacket solves this at least since he doesn’t have a lot of fat on his backside to keep it floating!
https://youtu.be/2WxdfwbicNk
That made me giggle louder than I thought it would.   
His face is awesome.
Ohh I became a kangaroo
😍
Neat
When you can’t relate because your tall ass never not touch the bottom of anything
Yea that’s been four years!!! How do you get knocked out cold in front of just anyone.

I was literally just making fun of people who believe the lies that those people arent dead and that they bet the HK protestors wish they could be russian green berets.
Next, he'll be driving to McDonald's
The moment it clicks is beautiful!
Behold! A man!
Master has given Dobby a pool, Dobby is FREEE
ENTERING KANGAROO.EXE
I love him.
Awww he's adorable! And the realization of he could stand in the pool and be fine is great :)
His maintained look of determination and awe as he discerns the laws of the universe he finds himself in is both admirable and, dare I say, cutetastic. All hail Canis lupus familiawesomeness!
Dog said : what the fuck am i doing then 🐶
LoOk At ME Im a hoOmaN
He do be standing tho
I is hooman.
What a gud boi
Shit. That's adorable.
So cute !
That's me realizing I could stand in the pool for the first time too.
The face of an epiphany
Ah, the water t-rex, a great white sharks only natural predator.
The moment when you realize you’ve been doing it the hard way! 😂
Great clip!  You can almost see the thought come into his head!\~
I love how his little paws dart out to adjust his position.
That dog is having an epetphany
Oh my god, that's so cute :3
T-Rex mode engaged.
That’s a fluffy trex
He’s evolving
Cute
My friend has a 3 month old Chihuahua,she is adorable and loves to ride in the boat!!!
I love pets 
TwT
"Look at me. I am the bipedal creature now."
I had a black lane that would do this. She’d just jump in and stand there for hours.
How cute!
Ma'am there's something wrong with your velociraptor
You have witnessed the evolution of the goodboi rex
wrr
He has become a kangaroo!
Judging from his face...Pretty sure he always knew he could stand ... It was just the first time he understood what peeing in pools was all about. Looks like that uncle some people have who thinks no one noticed... (Just teasing....so cuuute)!!!
Summer dont run I just want to pet you.
So, is this how fish started to walk out of the water and start to grow legs?
That's the furriest T-rex I've ever seen
Tyrannosaurus ruff
This is what we all need right now
T-rexi
As a former Lab dad, this is too awesome.
This is so fucking wierd
He's a good swimming
Awe poor guy!!!
🦖🦖
He has the high ground
Great, now you’ve gotta filter two kind of urine!
It’s like a furry, water t-Rex
His lil paws! He looks like a fluffy golden trex
Is like a 🦖
I knie a dog named rex and he looks similar 😉
Am Rex
Awesome wholesome goldi boi!
Hi five
Doggosaurus Rex
So... this must be how seal evolved. I need to go on quest to find the ancient alien swimming pools.
/u/machinegunxanny
So damn cute!!!
“Mom, there’s a fluffy T-Rex in the pool!”
Now he’s people
lil T-Rex
And the next phase of evolution began
Behold, a featherless biped
Imagine how weird that must be to the dog. Something you know you can do for *maybe* a few seconds normally, suddenly you can do it almost endlessly with a tiny adjustment here and there.
Wait for the moment when he realises he can pee while standing.
The fear on his face is so sad!
Now you've got a golden dino. Nice
He’s like ooooohhhhhh nooooookaay.
My dog always wears a life jacket but if you lift her up by the strap she will keep paddling until you set her down on her raft or the deck.
Dog be like: oooOooOoooOh I am HOOMAN I don’t drink from toilet because I am IDIOT oOoooOOOoOoOh
I like how he uses his little paws for balance.
*Aww, underwater tippy taps*
I can walk like a hooman...
Can we just sticky this? That way no one would need to repost it every week.
Yes
those front paws!!! theyre so cute!!!!
I am become T-Rex
Look at him standing on his hind legs. Like Rory Calhoun
Not even man. I thought he got impaled.
He’s like a little dinosaur with his arms up.
What if this single realization in this golden labs head lead to dogs walking on hind legs within ya few generations.
Cutest T-Rex this side of the Cretaceous period
Dogrex
Watta good boy ❤️
This is why dogs can't talk or type. If they could and they had social media, there would be no swimming dogs left.
Sooooo cute!

What a good buoy!
It puts the lotion in the basket...
Me, in water aerobics, hoping the instuctor can't see through water...but knowing they can and still not caring.
Is it ok for dog to go in pool in regards to hair in filter etc ?
He has a really great IG @codythelabrador
Out of curiosity, is it a bad idea to let dogs go in the pool? What with the chlorine and all
Look at me, I hooman.
he is soo cute :) hug him
He was actually sinking and accepting his fate, poor guy.
Is that Mark Zuckerberg?
tell me why the dog standing like mkslatt lmao
Dogs are the angels and we are the demons. I’m convinced.
I am hooman! I stand! 🤣
The evolution has begun!
r/likeus
Fuck I could watch that dog all day
Lol!
Whatsup with more and more videos about animals "realizing" things, are animals getting smarter or what's even going on? Because I don't ever remember seeing old videos or even black & white ones of animals realizing things, like for instance the cat who realizes it has ears after seeing itself in the mirror, that one perked my interest for sure because you can see it seeing it's ears probably for the first time and then touching them with its paws while it's still looking in the mirror. 

I mean it's kind of a reach but does anybody else think that even animals ( but only some, just like people ) are raising their conscious' these days, because I've been seeing more stuff like this lately, and it's just something that I've been thinking about for a while now.
This video is so old its probably among the first viral dog videos ever.
There's a 90% chance the owner is holding a cookie on the left, but that must feel good on the ol' bones.

Next he’s gong to learn you get owies on your feet doing that.
As cute as it was the last time this video was posted.
He’s a kangaroos
"Yo dog, it's not that deep."
T-rex
So cute! What a smart boy
Do dogs prefer to paddle or to walk through a pool? (If they have a choice like this one and know they can walk/stand in the pool)
That is cool AF!
Heard a story about a dog that would do this...

One day everyone is in the pool and the dog walk/floats over off by himself and suddenly the water around him turns yellow... The dog had excused himself to pee (in the pool!)
Are dogs related to raptors?
That's a weird-looking kangaroo
He realized that hes a "Stand user"! *wheeze*
Look at him, standing on two legs like a little Rory Calhoun
he a youngboy fan now
He looks like a little T-Rex with his arms like that 😂
helo frend wach dis I can do triks
omg if my dog would t found this out then he wouldn’t have gotten so paranoid of water after he fell in multiple times and we had to pull him out😂 btw he was like 80kg
Those little front paw kicks though...omg cuteness!
It's a meerdog.
I am t-Rex now
Challenge me now! The grasshopper becomes the master.
He found god. Or dog.

I remember my lifeboat coxswain saying if someone thinks they're drowning at the beach, first thing to ask is if they can touch the bottom. 9 times out of 10 they can stand up

Mayday mayday! I’m going down! Op scratch that.
Please, sir, can I have some more? 😀
Dog: How do you humans walk like this?  It's ridiculous!
Idk how this dog keeps his paddle paws from moving. My old dog did it when water was like a foot from him
We've all been there
He looks like a Dino standing in the water
You’re a good boy and I love you

PuppySaurus Rex.
Here, our doggo is doing the doggosaurus
This video has been on tv! It's a show called Animals Unscripted and the owner asks "are you really standing right now?" Super cute :)
Swimming dogs are the best kind of dogs, but I dig the standing dogs too
This is so funny
Smart doggo. Good doggo.
Better call the judge and get some fudge. 
Looks like your doggo turned into a T. rex 🦮♻️🦖
Kek
Hahahahah
So stinkin' cute!!!!
Dogs are exceptionally smart, if you have the patience to train them right, gentle like horses, they become excellent companions.
He realized then he could do his best trex impression finally :)
