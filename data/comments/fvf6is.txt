Reminds me of Tony Soprano and his ducks
Very wholesome
I‚Äôm guessing that wouldn‚Äôt fly with my cats. 

I‚Äôll show myself out.
It's all fun and games until that duck starts to shit in the pool.  And call his friends and family.
This is so cute. That duck was having fun.
I love the fat dog wandering into the frame at the very end.
"Tossing the duck" sounds like a euphemism
Having themselves a ducking good time
Omfg its beyond cute!! üíúüíúüíú
Tony Soprano?
I love ducks. Had several that were super tame. One swam in a river with me, but she was lazy and climbed onto my shoulder. Hiking in and back out, I had her in a backpack. She complained while on my back but was super content if the pack was in front of me. Too long for her to walk.

Dad:No! Don't Bring a duck to my home
Mom:(Buys it Anyway)
Dad and the duck:
We all know he was the one who didn't want a duck xD
Excellent! Thank you.
Is this /u/fuckswithducks?
My cat does this same thing. Without the flying bit but we play "kick the kitty" and she always comes back. Not actual kicking either.
Tho dog at the end be like: "Hey! I also some play!!
Is this the dirtiest window of all time or...?
This deserves a perfect loop
Look at those hands on his hips!
Out of curiosity: is chlorine bad for ducks?

This is still adorable though.
This is a very unique take on playing fetch with your pet. I love it!
How did he discover that the duck liked this in the first place?!

Well now I want a duck
When the duck when back to the person, I thought he was petting him
As an animal lover, adorable! As a pool maintenance man, those chems are gonna need an adjustment.
Is this how you play with Ducks? Like, what do you do with ducks, do you walk them? Do they have beds? Do you need a water source?
I can‚Äôt take it! It is too cute! I‚Äôm so drunk in the middle of the day and crying about a few things and this made my heart explode (in a good way)
Get the duck outta here!
Who's a good duck, who's a good duck, yes you're a good duck now flyyy

This is so adorable. Both look really happy to be playing
Where's dad?

*Mom sighs heavily* Outside, ducking around, as usual.
Plot twist: the duck just wants to get out of the pool
This is a different tier of love

He's going to need a couple extra glugs of chlorine. That duck pooped in his pool.
Doggo at the end really contemplating being thrown too

This reminds me of a story some years back about a guy that let an injured duck spend the winter in his swimming pool, since it couldn‚Äôt migrate. In the spring, the duck went back to it‚Äôs usual duck lifestyle. Except later it came back, and it brought hundreds of it‚Äôs closest friends and family members. The guy filmed so many ducks descending on his swimming pool, they blocked out the sky.
I love the dad stance.
That poor lonely dog.
Dad : I‚Äôll fry it and make it a peking duck if you bring that thing home.
Also Dad next day : wheeee fly little one
Just one "i" away from being on To Catch A Predator.
That's pretty fowl.

Stop throwing me in!!  I just want hugs!!

And, just like that, my girlfriend is asking for a pet duck again.
There's Getzlaf! Been wondering where he's been.

When your dad cares more about a bird than his own children
We had a pet duck as Kids and used to play a similar game with it. It'd run up and sit on your foot, and you'd "kick" to launch it backwards into the air. It'd then run back and sit on your foot again. Good times.
I guess it all started when the ducks left
-someone‚Äôs manager somewhere in the department
You know the love is real when the duck could easily achieve the same thing on its own but still wants its dad to do it
Cute as duck.
dad: doesn‚Äôt want a duck
also dad:
A duck is one of the most loyal pets you can I have. I found a duck egg once by a pond. All the other eggs were eaten by racoons. I took it home and hatched it in our neighbours incubator. We named him Edgar and he was later also eaten by a racoon :'(
I‚Äôm in love!
Reminds me of Tony soprano
Duck:weeeehooooo... Again dad.
Dad: up you go.
Duck: best dad you can get..weeeeehooooo.
awesome to watch, but as a pool owner... duck poop in my pool??? ewwww
No one‚Äôs going to mention the little dog at the bottom that decides to come watch?
I always wonder how did this start? Did he just throw the the one day and the duck said, jokes on you thats what i like
if that duck is anything like my 2 year old, he's going to be doing that all day.
Poor duck, just wanting a hug and all he gets is thrown off haha

Someone should tell the duck he can fly.
This is how you get bird flu.  Y'all ready for another pandemic?

Well if that isn‚Äôt the cutest thing! You can even see the little duck assume the ‚Äúok here we go!‚Äù posture when he picks him up.
Random neighborhood duck..... or pet duck?
Used to have two pet ducks. They‚Äôre awesome man so a video like this doesn‚Äôt surprise me. They have the quirkiest little personalities. During the summer they lived in my backyard. Had a little kiddie pool and covered area where they would chill. Whenever I would mow the lawn, they would both follow behind me until I was done. When I emptied the bag, they would stand at my feet and nibble on my shoe laces. 

They‚Äôre basically like little dogs that poop 10x more.
Oh my god, I love this so much. Wish I had a cute duck to play with
Oh god I read the title so wrong
This is so cute. That duck looks like he is having the time of his life. Adorable üòä
My grandparents had a pool.

They had a family of ducks one year.

Later that year they had a fucked up green pool that required it be drained, scrubbed, and most of the plumbing replaced.

Ducks are gross and they'll crap in your pool.

Soon he will be Capo of the New Jersey Mafia

And yet he probably would still eat duck..... üòíüòî
This reminds me of a cat, Scooter, I once had wise favorite thing to do was play fetch. He had got these sparkly, shiny fuzzy balls to play with. They smelled like catnip and had a bell inside. He never played with them unless we were in bed. He‚Äôd bring us a ball once we got settled and then he‚Äôd start playing on the end of the bed. I‚Äôd wait until he started to attack my toes, then I‚Äôd hold up the ball and shake it so the bell would dingle. He‚Äôd whip his head up with this wild look in his eyes and I‚Äôd throw it out the door into the living room. He‚Äôd fly off that bed and just rip through house! Oh man, he was such a great cat, I miss him. Anywho, once Scooter had that ball he‚Äôd trot back to the bed, jump up and drop the ball next to my hand, regardless of where it lay. After a while he‚Äôd  slow down and then it was cuddle time.ü•∞
Is that shed a duck house
Wholesome af!
I would love a pet duck
this man actually met the duck last week at the start of quarantine, and they quickly became best friends.

Dad ducks are huge
I found a bunch of ducklings that fell through a sewer grate, called the cops and a really cool officer got in the grate opening and handed one by one the ducklings up to me.  We ended up with over 10, mom duck was right near by and the babies ran off to her when she called.  I went back a couple hours later (behind a Staples store) and saw a lone duckling run under a dumpster.  Long and short of it, couldn't find mom in the nearby pond.  Took the sucker home and raised him, never let him get to tame, but he did sit under my chin to stay warm as I was on my laptop.  A couple months later he molted (or fledged) and he was a Mallard male (had no idea what he was until then).  Fuc\*ker was huge too, my two labs were afraid of him.  Gave him to a sanctuary and miss him to this day.

THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN OMG
My dad would go to the driveway and tap on the concrete and a lizard would come out and he‚Äôd feed the lizard a meal worm. Was fun to watch. Never sure how he‚Äôd trained the lizard that tapping meant food.
Man, I loved having ducks. We used to have this one we called the "Zombie duck" because he would try to nibble your touws off....
now the dog

Ducks make surprisingly lovely pets. They're messy, so they definitely need the proper space and enclosure, but they're very playful and affectionate. We used to have one named Ted. He loved snuggling and playing with the dog.
Love how he leaves his hands hanging in the air for a bit
This is so fucking wholesome
Joyous joyous joyous ü¶úü¶úü¶ú
Spent a summer raising a duck once, found him after he'd been abandoned by his mum, named him Leroy :) 

Would take long walks around the lake and Leroy would follow every step. 



Whenever I took out my kayak or canoe he would swim right behind it the whole way or sit on top of the kayak spray deck when he got tired. 


But eventually work got too much and we couldn't find time to take him for walks. So we found a local man with a small sanctuary we're Leroy could live with other birds and last I heard he's doing well.



Still miss that duck allot :')
He turns around fast! I didn‚Äôt know ducks could turn that quickly.
Of course a fat white chihuahua also lives there
I want to be this man.

Oh.. Mallard... that is adorable lol.

I WANT A DUCK. NOW.
It reminds me of The Sopranos
Hahahaha this is good! but comments got me rolling ü§£üëç
Someone once told me they were surprised Mad Men was one of my favorite shows because I‚Äôm such a strong feminist... it‚Äôs like have you not seen the show that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs great yeah there‚Äôs men being patriarchal as fuck throughout it but they wrote in great women characters like Joan becoming an executive Peggy having an abortion and finding her way to become a creative and having such a unique relationship with Don ... even Megan not taking Dons shit ! It screams feminine if you look at it! That‚Äôs exactly why it was so great! It showed us how far we‚Äôve come since the 60s or how we really haven‚Äôt come that far in some regards.

Quasimodo predicted this.
I cant help but think yeetus the feetus when he threw the duck

Duck: Again! Again!
Plot twist: The duck wants to attack him but he keeps getting thrown in the pool
I‚Äôm in bed trying to sleep without succes. This made my day, and hopefully night! Thanks duckdad!
TONY SOPRANO
I miss read that.
Something is off about this video. The way the duck swings his wing once he arrives at the guy‚Äòs feet is weird. It looks like it does twice exactly the same way!?
This made me cry
Yeet
Dad: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a pet‚Äù
Dad and the duck:
/u/vredditdownloader
He's quacking with laughter
How can I try to explain?
'Cause when I do, he duck again.
There is a video of him doing that here somewhere
Ops dad is u/fuckswithducks confirmed.
YEET
Love how he whips around so quickly for another launch
This was so wholesome, we needed something like this today with all that is going on. Thank you for sharing. Your Dad is awesome!
I love how the duck turns towards the pool almost if he is preparing his before takeoff checklist
I love how he spins his little duck butt around as if to say "again! Again!"
A dad and his duck, made us say "What the fuck!"
Wait this isn‚Äôt the original one, but that‚Äôs ok because it‚Äôs cute
I need the backstory to this
I bet this all started from a day he was pissed at the duck and threw it in the pond
dad: we're not getting a duck
*gets duck*
dad:
Guys, how do I get a duck?
Why do I expect it to laugh like Donald?
Dad, stop ducking around!
Duck Dadgers, Third (fl)Eye
Well there's something that you don't see every day.
Like fetch, but without the ball
Dozens of comments down and I still don't see it.

The duck has clipped wings.

If you don't want your pet birds to fly, get a dog.

The duck is happy in this clip.  It would be happier if it could fly.  Clipped wings puts the keel of a bird at great risk of breaking.

And these aren't clipped just a little, or to one side.

These are excessively clipped.  Chickens have more lift.

That dog at the end wanted to have a go, you can just feel it.
Social distancing?
Social distancing pls
He looks like Phil Swift
It's a mallard.
Is it safe for the duck to be swimming in chlorine?

Edit: Thanks reddit, apparently I can‚Äôt be sympathetic towards ducks.
*and pig
REPOSTED NERD SROP IT
Reeeeepost
That looks like a mallard, am I wrong or do you english speaking people just call all dabbling birds ducks?
This animal is trying to get food or something. it is 100% not coming to a f****** human to be thrown in the water. Thinking otherwise would be ignorance. Ignorance is bliss however I've heard.
