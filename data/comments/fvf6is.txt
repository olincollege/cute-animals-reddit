tony soprano would dig this.
“again, again, again!”
This made my morning
I can't tell who is having more fun.  Dad or duck?
I want a duck now
That lil dog that pops out at the end! He’s like ummm is there a problem out here dad??
I love how he puts his hands happily on his hips like “that’s my boy.”
Who gives a flying duck!?!?

Reminds me of Tony Soprano and his ducks
Very wholesome
I’m guessing that wouldn’t fly with my cats. 

I’ll show myself out.
It's all fun and games until that duck starts to shit in the pool.  And call his friends and family.
This is so cute. That duck was having fun.
I love the fat dog wandering into the frame at the very end.
"Tossing the duck" sounds like a euphemism
Having themselves a ducking good time
Omfg its beyond cute!! 💜💜💜
Tony Soprano?
I love ducks. Had several that were super tame. One swam in a river with me, but she was lazy and climbed onto my shoulder. Hiking in and back out, I had her in a backpack. She complained while on my back but was super content if the pack was in front of me. Too long for her to walk.

Day 20 quarantine.....need to get a pool and a duck
I can kinda hear the happy quacks.
If he had a bathrobe on it would be tony soprano
I needed this today! Thank you ❤
The duck is really enjoying this
Mom:We want to buy a duck.
Dad:No! Don't Bring a duck to my home
Mom:(Buys it Anyway)
Dad and the duck:
We all know he was the one who didn't want a duck xD
Excellent! Thank you.
Is this /u/fuckswithducks?
My cat does this same thing. Without the flying bit but we play "kick the kitty" and she always comes back. Not actual kicking either.
Tho dog at the end be like: "Hey! I also some play!!
Is this the dirtiest window of all time or...?
This deserves a perfect loop
Look at those hands on his hips!
Out of curiosity: is chlorine bad for ducks?

This is still adorable though.
This is a very unique take on playing fetch with your pet. I love it!
How did he discover that the duck liked this in the first place?!
u/DisjointedRig
How wholesome 😊
DUCK DUCK Goooooooose
Dirty ass windows.

Too damn cute

That dad is living his best life, and I’m jealous
Well now I want a duck
When the duck when back to the person, I thought he was petting him
As an animal lover, adorable! As a pool maintenance man, those chems are gonna need an adjustment.
Is this how you play with Ducks? Like, what do you do with ducks, do you walk them? Do they have beds? Do you need a water source?
I can’t take it! It is too cute! I’m so drunk in the middle of the day and crying about a few things and this made my heart explode (in a good way)
Get the duck outta here!
Who's a good duck, who's a good duck, yes you're a good duck now flyyy
What a quacking video!... I'll see myself out..
Dad, doesn’t want duck
Family, gets duck
Dad and duck,
I love this. What a lovely bond. I lost track of how many times I watched this loop. It’s so happy. Can you share more videos of them?
This is so adorable. Both look really happy to be playing
Where's dad?

*Mom sighs heavily* Outside, ducking around, as usual.
Plot twist: the duck just wants to get out of the pool
This is a different tier of love
This is the wholesome content I signed up for.
The dog plots his revenge, there can only be one
Dad: This duck is just not respecting those six foot guidelines. 

Also dad: Yeet!

That's a weird doggo
My relationship with my dad summed up with me at the bottom of the frame in the last second
Hahaha. It doesn’t want to leave him

He's going to need a couple extra glugs of chlorine. That duck pooped in his pool.
Doggo at the end really contemplating being thrown too

This reminds me of a story some years back about a guy that let an injured duck spend the winter in his swimming pool, since it couldn’t migrate. In the spring, the duck went back to it’s usual duck lifestyle. Except later it came back, and it brought hundreds of it’s closest friends and family members. The guy filmed so many ducks descending on his swimming pool, they blocked out the sky.
I love the dad stance.
That poor lonely dog.
Dad : I’ll fry it and make it a peking duck if you bring that thing home.
Also Dad next day : wheeee fly little one
Just one "i" away from being on To Catch A Predator.
That's pretty fowl.
"Quack quack quack quack. 

**QUAAAAACK**"
Always found it funny that ducks imitate animals and humans.
Why did I read this the wrong way first
Smiles so big.
That 180 by the duck doe
Cat: This shit again?

He is playing fetch with the duck, and duck both the stick and fetcher. Wow, they are spending some quality time.

Luckily just a few floaty toys keeps them away.

I love ducks! 
Wife asked why my duck is so small.
This is hilarious and something I haven't seen before. Duck throw and fetch, the new pet sport.
Oh boy he QUACKN'
Stop throwing me in!!  I just want hugs!!
I'm absolutely sure first he said "What the duck are we going to do with a duck?" which is very fitting for /r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
As a recreational pilot, I can appreciate the desire to practice one's soft landings.

Looks like a greenhead. Is this a wild mallard?

It’s kinda like reverse fetch with a dog.
Best video I've seen all year
Omg the joy on his face is so very clear from the side of his face
So adorable!!!
I threw a duck once, when u was in Vietnam. The duck loved it

And, just like that, my girlfriend is asking for a pet duck again.
There's Getzlaf! Been wondering where he's been.
The dog is happy that he found someone else to throw in the pool
Look real close and you can see a fishing line stuck to the ducks bill...

How does one get a pet duck?
I have 12 ducks. One is laying on eggs right now so soon to be more. 

They are awesome pets until it’s mating season.  Then you get a HUGE surprise.

When your dad cares more about a bird than his own children
We had a pet duck as Kids and used to play a similar game with it. It'd run up and sit on your foot, and you'd "kick" to launch it backwards into the air. It'd then run back and sit on your foot again. Good times.
I guess it all started when the ducks left
-someone’s manager somewhere in the department
You know the love is real when the duck could easily achieve the same thing on its own but still wants its dad to do it
Cute as duck.
dad: doesn’t want a duck
also dad:
A duck is one of the most loyal pets you can I have. I found a duck egg once by a pond. All the other eggs were eaten by racoons. I took it home and hatched it in our neighbours incubator. We named him Edgar and he was later also eaten by a racoon :'(
I’m in love!
Reminds me of Tony soprano
Duck:weeeehooooo... Again dad.
Dad: up you go.
Duck: best dad you can get..weeeeehooooo.
awesome to watch, but as a pool owner... duck poop in my pool??? ewwww
No one’s going to mention the little dog at the bottom that decides to come watch?
I always wonder how did this start? Did he just throw the the one day and the duck said, jokes on you thats what i like
if that duck is anything like my 2 year old, he's going to be doing that all day.
Poor duck, just wanting a hug and all he gets is thrown off haha

Someone should tell the duck he can fly.
This is how you get bird flu.  Y'all ready for another pandemic?

Poor duck has clipped wings :(((
In things like this is where I see God (not in religion).
Well if that isn’t the cutest thing! You can even see the little duck assume the “ok here we go!” posture when he picks him up.
Random neighborhood duck..... or pet duck?
Used to have two pet ducks. They’re awesome man so a video like this doesn’t surprise me. They have the quirkiest little personalities. During the summer they lived in my backyard. Had a little kiddie pool and covered area where they would chill. Whenever I would mow the lawn, they would both follow behind me until I was done. When I emptied the bag, they would stand at my feet and nibble on my shoe laces. 

They’re basically like little dogs that poop 10x more.
Oh my god, I love this so much. Wish I had a cute duck to play with
Oh god I read the title so wrong
This is so cute. That duck looks like he is having the time of his life. Adorable 😊
My grandparents had a pool.

They had a family of ducks one year.

Later that year they had a fucked up green pool that required it be drained, scrubbed, and most of the plumbing replaced.

Ducks are gross and they'll crap in your pool.

Yes! This makes me miss my childhood pet duck. We used to play this game and tag. The duck and our pet dog used to cuddle and sleep together too.
Soon he will be Capo of the New Jersey Mafia
This is so blessed
I like to think the duck is only doing this because the dad enjoys it
I wish I had sound for this. i bet it was hilarious

[Hey duck!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9kZrOiqaKk)
And yet he probably would still eat duck..... 😒😔
This reminds me of a cat, Scooter, I once had wise favorite thing to do was play fetch. He had got these sparkly, shiny fuzzy balls to play with. They smelled like catnip and had a bell inside. He never played with them unless we were in bed. He’d bring us a ball once we got settled and then he’d start playing on the end of the bed. I’d wait until he started to attack my toes, then I’d hold up the ball and shake it so the bell would dingle. He’d whip his head up with this wild look in his eyes and I’d throw it out the door into the living room. He’d fly off that bed and just rip through house! Oh man, he was such a great cat, I miss him. Anywho, once Scooter had that ball he’d trot back to the bed, jump up and drop the ball next to my hand, regardless of where it lay. After a while he’d  slow down and then it was cuddle time.🥰
Is that shed a duck house
Wholesome af!
I would love a pet duck
this man actually met the duck last week at the start of quarantine, and they quickly became best friends.
I want a duck now.

Watch out that mosquito!
And panic attack follows next....
Omg, I love how it quickly spins around to get thrown again!!
I love how when the duck reaches the guy, he already turns facing the pool, he knows the dad is going to toss him
This is so wholesome
That’s he cutest thing I’ve ever seen!
So cute! I wonder how on earth they reached this place. 😂 i.e What makes you throw the duck the first time?

Dad ducks are huge
I found a bunch of ducklings that fell through a sewer grate, called the cops and a really cool officer got in the grate opening and handed one by one the ducklings up to me.  We ended up with over 10, mom duck was right near by and the babies ran off to her when she called.  I went back a couple hours later (behind a Staples store) and saw a lone duckling run under a dumpster.  Long and short of it, couldn't find mom in the nearby pond.  Took the sucker home and raised him, never let him get to tame, but he did sit under my chin to stay warm as I was on my laptop.  A couple months later he molted (or fledged) and he was a Mallard male (had no idea what he was until then).  Fuc\*ker was huge too, my two labs were afraid of him.  Gave him to a sanctuary and miss him to this day.

Thats a ducking cool duck, duck!

family: wants a pet
dad: doesnt want a pet
family: gets pet anyways
dad and the pet:
I have not giggled like this in a long time
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN OMG
My dad would go to the driveway and tap on the concrete and a lizard would come out and he’d feed the lizard a meal worm. Was fun to watch. Never sure how he’d trained the lizard that tapping meant food.
Man, I loved having ducks. We used to have this one we called the "Zombie duck" because he would try to nibble your touws off....
now the dog
That Mallard is Neato!

Ducks make surprisingly lovely pets. They're messy, so they definitely need the proper space and enclosure, but they're very playful and affectionate. We used to have one named Ted. He loved snuggling and playing with the dog.
Love how he leaves his hands hanging in the air for a bit
This is so fucking wholesome
Joyous joyous joyous 🦜🦜🦜
Spent a summer raising a duck once, found him after he'd been abandoned by his mum, named him Leroy :) 

Would take long walks around the lake and Leroy would follow every step. 



Whenever I took out my kayak or canoe he would swim right behind it the whole way or sit on top of the kayak spray deck when he got tired. 


But eventually work got too much and we couldn't find time to take him for walks. So we found a local man with a small sanctuary we're Leroy could live with other birds and last I heard he's doing well.



Still miss that duck allot :')
He turns around fast! I didn’t know ducks could turn that quickly.
Of course a fat white chihuahua also lives there

Someone once told me they were surprised Mad Men was one of my favorite shows because I’m such a strong feminist... it’s like have you not seen the show that’s why it’s great yeah there’s men being patriarchal as fuck throughout it but they wrote in great women characters like Joan becoming an executive Peggy having an abortion and finding her way to become a creative and having such a unique relationship with Don ... even Megan not taking Dons shit ! It screams feminine if you look at it! That’s exactly why it was so great! It showed us how far we’ve come since the 60s or how we really haven’t come that far in some regards.

Quasimodo predicted this.

Duck: Again! Again!
Plot twist: The duck wants to attack him but he keeps getting thrown in the pool

I miss read that.
Something is off about this video. The way the duck swings his wing once he arrives at the guy‘s feet is weird. It looks like it does twice exactly the same way!?
This made me cry
Yeet
Dad: “I don’t want a pet”
Dad and the duck:
/u/vredditdownloader
He's quacking with laughter
How can I try to explain?
'Cause when I do, he duck again.
There is a video of him doing that here somewhere
Ops dad is u/fuckswithducks confirmed.
YEET
Love how he whips around so quickly for another launch
This was so wholesome, we needed something like this today with all that is going on. Thank you for sharing. Your Dad is awesome!
I love how the duck turns towards the pool almost if he is preparing his before takeoff checklist
I love how he spins his little duck butt around as if to say "again! Again!"
A dad and his duck, made us say "What the fuck!"
Wait this isn’t the original one, but that’s ok because it’s cute
I need the backstory to this
I bet this all started from a day he was pissed at the duck and threw it in the pond
dad: we're not getting a duck
*gets duck*
dad:
Guys, how do I get a duck?
Why do I expect it to laugh like Donald?
Dad, stop ducking around!

Well there's something that you don't see every day.
Like fetch, but without the ball
Dozens of comments down and I still don't see it.

The duck has clipped wings.

If you don't want your pet birds to fly, get a dog.

The duck is happy in this clip.  It would be happier if it could fly.  Clipped wings puts the keel of a bird at great risk of breaking.

And these aren't clipped just a little, or to one side.

These are excessively clipped.  Chickens have more lift.

That dog at the end wanted to have a go, you can just feel it.
Social distancing?
Social distancing pls
He looks like Phil Swift
It's a mallard.
Is it safe for the duck to be swimming in chlorine?

Edit: Thanks reddit, apparently I can’t be sympathetic towards ducks.
*and pig
REPOSTED NERD SROP IT
Reeeeepost
That looks like a mallard, am I wrong or do you english speaking people just call all dabbling birds ducks?
This animal is trying to get food or something. it is 100% not coming to a f****** human to be thrown in the water. Thinking otherwise would be ignorance. Ignorance is bliss however I've heard.
