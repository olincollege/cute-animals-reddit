Those ears are gonna make him tip over
So cute and unusual looking! I'd like to see a picture of that guy when he's all grown up. Pls keep us posted as he grows. He's a cutie.
I really hope he never grows into his ears. He is absolutely gorgeous!
How is this the cutest thing I've ever seen?

I've been lying to my dog.

Thanks OP. You made me a liar.
You should do a doggy DNA kit if you can afford it! It would be so cool to see the lineage for this cute pup! 
No one needs to give him a sock he is just going to take them
he almost doesn't seem real, he's that impossibly cute! what part of West Texas? 
r/incorgnito 

Edit:  wow! I'm glad I helped so many people find this adorable sub.  Thanks for the silver! 
Put socks on his big ears
Dobby is a very fitting name! So cute! 
Looks exactly like Trico from The Last Guardian
One of my dogs looked just like that as a puppy. This is him  [now.](https://i.imgur.com/CnjLBQi.jpg)
Aww, wish I had found him. Take good care of him. 
I bet he can hear things that are happening thousands of miles away with ears like those lol. He is so cute, I'm glad you found him, there isn't a lot out there in west TX. You saved his life, for sure!
He looks like he's part fennec fox! Sooo cute!
It's Batmousepup
We know he's a GOOD boy. But is he a FREE boy?
If you have any stories you'd like to share this pup is all ears.
OMG what a cutie! I hate that people dump so many animals around the rigs!
He is just precious!
"In the oil fields of West Texas" makes it sound like a western. 
I think you have a baby coyote. Super cute tho!
... are you sure that isn‚Äôt a Coyote?
Lots of issues with people dumping pets out in here in Midland.  Just be sure it‚Äôs actually a dog, as there‚Äôs lots of coyotes, even in town in Midland, right now.
You found a fucking Pokemon! Congratulations.
Definitely thought he could be part Corgi
Dude, that's no puppy.  Just don't get it wet and don't feed it after midnight.
You should nickname him Sweet Crude
Nickname "Slick"
Get him Vaccinated for distemper ASAP.  It is a huge issue down in TX.
Aww he looks like Trico from the last guardian. 
Cute-acabra
I'm in love. 
Omg he's cute.
Those ears are amazing! Wonder if he gets satellite reception on those babies?
Holy shit he's cute. 
man all i ever find in odessa/midland oil patches is rattlesnakes and shit
Right on man, dogs in the field make my day
A shepcor? A corshep? In other words he looks like a Shepard corgi mix to me! He sure is cute!
He looks like a German Shepherd Chihuahua mix but IDK if that's even possible. 
So cute! Fellow west Texan here! Thanks for sharing! 
That's a coyote 
pretty sure thats a fox
Great ear to leg ratio!! If he grows into those he‚Äôs gonna be a big boy!
So cute!  Is he gonna grow up to be a roughneck!  (Fort Stockton?)  
u shoulda names him Yoda 
Part doggie, part chupacabra, 100% cutie.
My pitbull‚Äôs name is Dobby. His ears were huge when he was a puppy. He has grown into them finally. 
A beautiful free elf :)
Is that a babby german shepherd?
Plot twist. It's actually a mini bear. Newly discovered ancient species.  
 

[u/QtipJC](https://www.reddit.com/user/QtipJC)  Wook at that cute face and those ears!! Was he out there all by himself? Wow, what a great thing to take this pup in. Are you going to keep him, or rehome him? Wots of wuck, hes adowable!!! üê∂

Midland?
Looks like it's got a bit of corgi in it
I brought home an abandoned dog that wandered onto the rig I roughnecked on during a -10 degree Northern PA winter. She was sick and skinny but friendly and protective so I brought her home and got her healthy. Turns out she was pregnant and now I have 3 beautiful Pitbull/Plott Hound/Rottweiler mixes.
I want him! 
That has to be the cutest puppy I have ever seen. His ears are bigger than his legs.  üòç
Such a sweetie! I went to West Texas oil country last year and all I got was a sandstorm. 
[deleted]
I also have a pupper named Dobby!! Best dog name ever :)

[Dobby](https://imgur.com/gallery/NymLsZj) 
https://i.imgur.com/Q8Himmz.jpg here‚Äôs my Dobby! It‚Äôs the name the shelter gave him and we just couldn‚Äôt change it!
oil fields of west texas... like midland and odessa?
I've seen rig dogs on some remote rigs in southern Argentina. Those dogs had the life.

The rig personnel had to stay on site for months at a time. They would have all kinds of food delivered to location since the nearest grocery store was 3 hours away, 2 of which were spent on a dumpy rig truck. They'd get steaks, full lambs, roasts and those rig dogs would dine on the leftovers. 

I remember standing on the rig floor staring out into El Tordillo field seeing the occasional glimmer of coyote and puma eyes in the darkness not flooded by the rig lights. Blanca would sit on the rig floor knowing never to wander in the dark at night, seeming to understand that the light guaranteed safety. There was a big pillow right behind the driller's chair. She would curl up right there in the dog House every night. 

I never did get to say good bye to her because one day she just stopped showing up. After a few days me and the other foreigners feared the worst. When we asked the rig manager he told us the off shift company man had taken her home for her check up and shots at the vet. We had to leave before the other company man rotated on. One of the guys we met there still sends pictures of her on location years later. I don't know if they are a thing in West Texas, but rig dogs hold a special place in my heart. 
I didn‚Äôt notice anywhere in the comments indicating that you answered this already but... you‚Äôre keeping him right?
Usually I'd say "He'll grow into those ears..." but not with those legs he won't.
Midland? Odessa?
He looks just like Dobby.
Dude, clean your car.
Omg, he is the cutest baby dog I think I have ever seen!! What a sweetie! He has what it takes to be an internet star. I am a disabled homebound senior and seeing these precious fur angels actually make my life so much brighter! I would love to see this guy grow up and the adventures you have. Blessings to both of You! You are blessed to have found each other.

Thank you for saving this sweet life ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very fitting name
I am so glad you gave him a home! So very happy! There is too many strays here in west texas and have been some sad sad stories in the news about the vets in Odessa. Poor pups deserve more people like you.üíù
My dad brought home a kitten from the oil fields in ND. Maybe i should post a picture
You probably saved his life! He is Adorable!!

Little guy looks like some sort of Shepherd-Corgi mix, possibly with some other things thrown in there for fun. I have no idea what it is with Texas and adorable strays, my Golden/Husky was found alongside a highway in Del Rio.

He‚Äôs absolutely adorable, take good care of the little guy! He‚Äôs lucky to have you!
Teach ol Dobby to flop his ears and that little fella is FA-lying!
Whenever I see stuff like this, I worry that his momma is looking for him. 
That's a perfect name for perfect ears.

Fricken AWWWWWW !!!
Congratulations at finding the only successful attempt at crossbreding a German Shepard with a Chihuahua. 
Oh my gosh, CUTE!
It will be interesting to see what he looks like when he grows up
We sure it‚Äôs a puppy?
He looks like a Dobby! Great name! Always kills me how ppl can be so callous as to abandon animals. I‚Äôm so glad he has a forever home! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I had family out in west Texas, also in the oilfield....all kinds of critters out there
[deleted]
That is a bat that is waiting for his legs/paws to be wings/claws
Aww so cute!
Master has given Dobby a home. Dobby is saved!
If dogs & wolves and dogs & coyotes can interbreed, can two gen 1 (or gen *n*)mixed breed a further generation with all three species present?
Totally Hypothetical
Odessa by any chance ? 
Texas oil field dog is adopted into my family too. Enjoy!
Beeville TX here. Oilfields is big money, but it looks like you got a bonus there.
Cute puppy. 

Clean your car.
Where‚Äôs his pillowcase?
That's how we got one of our kittens. Husband works in odessa as well and brought home a kitten left in the middle of his field. Congrats on your new baby! 
Those ears tho! ‚ù§
Thanks OP! Good way to start 2019 :)
i reposted ur pic on r/rarepuppers lettinng u know

So freaking cute!
Dobby must poke master. Dobby wants to go for a walk. 
Bless you, and here's to many happy years together!
Damn good name. Take my upvote damnit
OP, you can see The thankfulness in Lil Pupperino‚Äôs eyes that you rescued him. You will have a forever friend from now on. Good for you!!! Proud of you!!
I give him all of the socks!!! üòçüòçüòç
Any chance he's a Heeler? The Australian Heeler is a dingo/Aussie shepherd mix, and the breed is popular on cattle ranches. Tough, beautiful, smart, loyal, and sneaky. Whatever this little guy is he looks like a keeper!
Why is it you always find a pup when you don‚Äôt need one and then you‚Äôre like shit.... can‚Äôt let the lil cutie live in the streets. But the minute you look for a pup to raise its like 12500000 dollars
This isn't uncommon. Back when my brother in law worked out there someone dumped a boston terrier after she had a litter of pups. She ended up being an amazing girl, not just a good girl, an amazing girl.
Anyone who can't take 5 minutes to take the dog to the shelter and or pay a surrender fee is a sociopath. Plain and simple scum of the Earth.

Lol odessa tx?

Thank you so much! I've been having a really rough time and your little guy made me smile.

Seriously, what a cutie pie. I can't wait to have a little dude of my own. 

Hope you guys have some great adventures. 
Please create an Instagram account so I can watch him grow. 
he looks kinda like a corgi/German Sheppard mix?  Maybe a touch of dachshund.
You caught a chupacabra..... That‚Äôs a chupacabra. 
You just 'found' the world's cutest puppy like that? In the wild, abandoned, and you had to save him from some immediate danger I'm sure.
Are we super sure that's actually a dog and not some fox or coyote?
Hope he doesn‚Äôt try to escape a serial killing witch only to accidentally let a knife slip into the teleportation and stab him while lying on a beach and cause one of the most traumatic experiences a child could have which can lead to crying, denial and DEAR GOD WHY DID YOU HAVE TO DIE?! HE WAS SO INNOCENT AND HARMLESS AND HE HAS NEVER HAD HAPPINESS IN HIS LIFE UP UNTIL HE MET HARRY WHICH WAS SHORT COMPARED TO HIS WHOLE LIFE AS A SLAVE YET STILL FELT HAPPINESS WHEN EMBRACED BY HIS FRIEND IN HIS DEATH BED! WHY DID YOU LEAVE US!

Just don‚Äôt let that happen kk?
If he's going to steal your socks, that would be fitting...
My puppy is the blonde version of your Dobby. Same age. [little bitty](http://imgur.com/uRqD1JW)

Hi Dobby ‚ù§
Coyte/corgi my guess 
How do people keep finding puppies. I haven't once. I'm sure it's the only way i'll be able to get  a pup to love
we'll need another picture in 6 months just to see if it grows into them ears.

If you hear a loud crashing sound, Don't mind it, I'm definitely not stealing your adorable puppy. 
 watch it end up being a Coyote lol 
Sonic cup is a dead giveaway. Are those things anywhere outside of Texas?
Why is your car so dirty 
Have you provided him with a sock yet?
Someone at home right now:  
‚ÄúHun I lost our puppy at the oil fields‚Äù

He can have all the socks!
Corgi genes for sure.
I love him. 10/10 would use his ears for navigation. 
Looks s like some type of german shepard and corgi/chihauhau mix. Awww
Sweet puppy!
That's a Coyote.
The size of those ears! If he had a trunk, he‚Äôd be Dumbo.
Remindme! 6 months
What a perfect name :)
Is this a German shepherd/corgi mix..?
Looks like a wolf pup
Is that a bear!
!Remindme 6 months
He ears too big for he goddarn face!
Give the good boy a sock

Like an evolution of Eevee!!! Like Umbreon..
Those feet!
Remindme! 6 months
Turn photo upside down and he's a bat! Cute fellow!
I have my own Dobby. He's a bearded dragon. 
I really want to hear the story of how you came along him. I went to tech so I'm really familiar with West Texas, be as specific and obscure as you'd like.

Midland??
Oh my God, he's so adorable! He kind of looks like Dobby too. Hahaha. Those cute ears!
Omg, it‚Äôs baby Trico!
I live in west texas I WANT HIM
 coyote it looks like
Cute little rascal, but might be a Chupacabra.
Well....in a few months you will see what you brought into your life. Who cares what is will be....the pup will see you as a caring soul. I would do the same. I have seen individuals raising lions and the lions see the individuals years later and it priceless. ...the lions literally change into little cubs lovingly.
Dobby is a free pup
You shouldve named him Western Oilfield

Gotta be some kind of Shepherd with those bat ears. Very cute.

Looks like a chihuahua/dachshund mix
Give him some socks / boot-ies and he'll be complete! üòç
Clean your car.  
A coyote corgy mix?  Coygy
That‚Äôs Skippy Jon Jones.
Dude, really nice that you rescued that puppy, but clean up your truck man.
Such a mutt!
That's a Coygi 
OMG.  I am obsessed!!!  He is sooo cute and I adore his name.  
That's a piglet. 
He looks like an oil worker.
Dog's name checks out.
Chihuahua german shepherd maybe? I have one and I swear they have the same ears. So cute. 
Shit yeah, cowboy. 
Greetings from Waco, pup üòÅ
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Dobby 
If you can‚Äôt raise him or her we can take him
Those are not ears they are wings for flying.
Give him a sock
Awww!!! He‚Äôs so freaking cute üòç
The cutest thing everrrrr!!!! 
I‚Äôm almost sure that that‚Äôs a fox and not a dog ü§î
I can't possibly IMAGINE why you named it that perfect name.
Give the damn dog a sock!
Hey! I have a dog named Dobby too (also known as Dobbs, Dobster, main b, number one b, and love of my life). She‚Äôs getting older now, which is scary, but it‚Äôs been joyful the whole time. Have fun and don‚Äôt forget to stop and pet the dog. 
‚ÄùDobby¬†has heard of your greatness, sir, but of your goodness,¬†Dobby¬†never knew..."
That‚Äôs a good looking pup 
No idea how that little thing is holding up those ears!  Too cute! 
Dobby is a loved elf..
They call me "Mr. Ears"! 
So cute. I just want to smoosh him with cuddles. Those ears are adorable. 
Thank you for saving him.

What a cutie!! We got a puppy before Christmas after three years of being dogless, and I love that sweet pupper so freaking much already. Dogs are just the best!
What kind of truck are you driving op? Couldn't help but notice the elog 
Really?? Tell me the truth...
You should have named him Radar. 
Best dog I ever had came from a lease road in Midland, Tx. Congratulations!
Not gonna lie I originally read that as daddy and was like ‚Äúum.... interesting name choice‚Äù but for real he‚Äôs so cute!!! Ahhhh
You may have found the chupacabra.
He's awesome. A warrior.

It's obviously an extraterrestrial.
Dobby.....I used to like that elf.....
Sorry to be a normie, but can somebody tell me the breed of this doggo?
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a coyote 
He will make a fine house elf.
That‚Äôs a good name.
Half bat, half dog :)
You name him Shell? Or Exxon? 
Please give him one baby sock to put on and master has now given Dobby a sock
Amazing dog but by they way you keep your truck so dirty I dont think you are fit for that dog responsible... you should give home to me

Scobby Dobby ddo!
You. Found. That. You're the luckiest person of 2019. I would kill to come across a baby like that
Oh please let his favorite toy be socks!
Adorable 
West Texas or West, Texas? If it's the latter, can you pick me up some kolaches?
Love his cute precious ears. Bless you for saving him.
Thats a chupacabra
Master has given Dobby a HOME!
You‚Äôve been bamboozled, fren!

I could be wrong but I think that‚Äôs actually a common fruit bat. üêæ
Which Pokemon is this
Why would you ruin such a cute puppy with a name like Dobby?
My little Yorkie was found in the cotton fields of West Texas. 
Man, roughnecks get all the pretty things
