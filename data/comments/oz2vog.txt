I like the idea that you don't get to choose what to buy, That he chooses for you.
I’d lose all my money
"sir please be professional, stop petting me, I'm trying to feed my family"
'Take the damn cucumber already!'
Now this is customer service.
Used to own, he has since retired
Damn im melted, he's so cutee omg!
Taroumaru?
Paid in cuddles ohhh I would be broke with this guy
Dog: “sir please this is harassment. I have bills to pay either buy this cucumber or leave”.
The dog that passed away last month was Ken, who worked at a [roasted sweet potato stand.](https://sea.mashable.com/culture/16114/adorable-japanese-dog-that-sold-roasted-sweet-potato-passes-away)  

This is a different business dog.  😊

Hello yes! I would like to speak to your boss! No there’s no issue here, just want to say he’s a good boi!
Last time I pet my local 7 11 clerk I got arrested Wtf. Not cool.
How is a dog that’s more successful than me supposed to make me feel better?
Only dogecoin accepted here!!
Ah, the story of Doge. He lost his money in the crypto market then moved to Japan to pursue his real dream job of serving hoomans cucumbers.
Ok I’m going there!
I always feel sad when I fall.
Makes me more sad that a doggy is more successful than me
Ahh this must be the dog from the Duolingo Japanese course that sells hats!
A dog has a shop and I still live with my family unemployed !! ….  Farewell fucking life ….. going to jump from a nearby cliff now  …..
Taroumaru irl
Dog thought it had enough but just couldn't resist coming to get more
Think about the robbery
Time for a slobbery cuke
taroumaru irl
"Cigarettes, no,  not cucumber, CIGG-A-RETTS, ugh fine one cucumber then."
I was angry at work for something and this video totally calmed me down. Cucumber squeak soothing.
"just take the fuckin cucumber sir and leave your change on the counter. Jfc"
“Take your cucumber, and stop petting me sir”
Location💳💳💳
can't buy things from him i have fur allergy
This dog is more successful than I am
You look like you could use a cucumber!
He doesn’t want pets, he wants business.
If just all my grocery shopping trips were like this 😊
i believe the dog isnt running the shop anymore and has since retired

Shibas are not japanese pet, they are japanese people

"That will be 80 scritches please!"
Shiba: DO YOU WANT THE CUCUMBER OR NOT?
Sales are through the ruff!
If you’re feeling down because you can’t find a job…
That explains my dogecoin volatility.
Doge is having to run a store now?
Here's your tentacle dildo sir
Tofu Chan?
DOGGO SHOP
Awww cute doggy selling dildo
I was having a bad week this made me smile
Maybe ...
Hmm. I don’t know if I want to buy the cucumber if the shop owner grabs it with his mouth… :/
しばいぬ
I fell sad.
If you fell sad, just try to pick yourself up
What if I fell happy?
Damn that dog doing better then me
Here sir is a cucumber. It will aid you on your journey and protect you from cats.
Of course he does. He's the DOGE himself!
I'm pretty sure this is over a decade old which means there is a high chance this dog has retired. However, there is likely a new dog in their place.
Now I am sad I can't go to their shop.
Khajiit has wares If you have coin






( I know khajiit are cats but like shut up )

#***I go to Tokyo***
Perhaps he is an alien from outer space.
“I know you wanted smokes but here’s a cucumber - much heathy. Such wow!”
"Pack your things we're leaving"
They should have a special forces team hiding above the store 24/7 in case anyone tries to rob it
Ah yes I remember. It's his paw print on the lease
Stop stroking him, he is trying to work.  Are you going to buy the dildo or not?
Tokyo is so interested
ITS TOO CUTE FOR ME TO HANDLE
Stop petting me, and buy the damn cucumber!
If you fell sad, get back up and be happy.
"Shiba-san, can I buy your love please? Just a tiny bit today?"
i can only imagine they go into the back and just grab whatever they see first and give it to you, like “this is what you wanted today now give moneys and head pat”
When I do this to the cashiers at other stores I always end up being escorted out to await the police.
Flawless business model.
Hello? Yes, this is dog.
More dogs should own shops.
This is wholesome
Cutey Shiba exchanges cucumber for pats. Yup, fair enough.
WOW. such customer
Yea I’m not eating no cucumber that’s been in an this dog’s mouth bro.
I don't want to be the bearer of bad news but I believe this was the shibe that passed away recently in japan...
My lord he's so cute.
This guy has the best prices ngl. Also accepts dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies
Many people arent happy because their professional life isnt ok, like unemployment or debts. And then you tell us a dog has a shop in Tokyo.

Yeah... I am so happy for knowing that...
That's a good doge
good boi :)
Taroumara
Is it technically a "Pet" shop?.... Because you go there to pet the dog 🤔 or because it belongs to a pet?
Looks to accept doge coin.
If I have to pay to pet the dog sign me the fuck up
I'd pay just to be allowed to pet that pupper!
This genuinely made me smile a lot. I love this video and that dog. ❤️
Your cucumber thanks a lot!
He has wares if you have pats
You pay money to pet this doggy whilst he shows you a cucumber. BRILLIANT!
Here is cucumber. That will be 20 shmackos
Much commerce! Such shop! Very cashier!
I fell... it was sad
Taroumaru-san?
ive never fell sad
Hay can I get a cookie and how much belly rubs is that ?
No quedan Calipo ninio, solo Masibon.
This is ridiculous, we shouldn't joke about workplace harrasment.
I wonder if the doggo needs any weekend help. Commute would be tough but hey, it would be worth it to have this boss over the one I have now.
This further proves my theory that everything is better in Japan
I gib good price you come back you buy from me
Do you accept  hehehe… dogecoin, Shiba-San? Hehehehehe

Fuck off. The cucumber is ¥100. Pay or get out…..Or give more scritches.
Made my day! Thx so much for this I was having a rough day.
“Doge has wares if you have pats.”
Sadly, the dog died in june.
No petting! No petting! No... Nooo! You go pet your mother! Here is a cucumber, you!
Completely illogical how could a dog run a shop?
Sad because he died last June :(
[deleted]
Reverse card;

Now i'm even more sad because I'm in Tokyo and can't go see this dog.

Also this video is so old that dog is most certainly dead.
Guys Reddit don’t show me all of the legends that award my post so I wanna say I LOVE YOU thanks so much for the supportemote:free\_emotes\_pack:grin
I wanna buy my groceries from cute doggo every day of the week! I light up like a firefly butt everytime I see a dog.
saddest part, he is not with us anymore.
I don't save and upvote much in general, but this was too funny and cute to watch :D
no the shop is gone now
The goodest of boys!
Me to my entire family: pack your things we're leaving
I mean, shit service but I'd still spend all my money there
Dog: are you going to order or just pad me??
へ〜ー Where in Tokyo?
I would travel to japan just to pet this good boi..
Cuet
how can I be sad! this is the ultimate happy pill! I bet that cutie also deserves belly rubs 😍
I love Shiba's so much!

Our Shiba/ long hair Chihuahua mix is one amazing girl. Such a pain in the ass. But, she's worth every minute of it.
Umm yeah I’m even more sad now, this dog’s small business is more successful than mine.
Client bribery with scritches!!!!!!!!!
You give scratches i give cucumber
![gif](giphy|Lr9r4NkWyNyYo)
He drives a hard bargain but I’ll take the lot at pull price and with head scratches.
This video makes me miss my shiba inu
This couldn’t not exist in America.
As others have mentioned he passed away in June. 

*EDIT* Wrong dog. Unless someone can find a more recent article he's since retired

This just saved my whole day
**Fun Fact:** He also invented DOGE Coin
Man you know it’s tough times when you need and extra set of paws around the shop.
I’ll take 50 doge.
He/She passed away last month..
That huge cucumber could have been the sign of a crossover episode with Yonitale
This is just gambling, how could you possibly not buy everything in the shop
Well thanks for making us even more sad ya dip shit
Did...the dog died recently.
"He you go sir, one cucumber. That'll be 37 head scritches please and thank you."
Just saying. Dogs are a blessing and the best thing mankind has created.
Owned* he passed a few months ago 😞😞
Benson and Hedges please, and something for the weekend.
Yes if you feel sad remember your life is worse off than a dog that should make you feel better
That dog looks high as hell.
Do you have to pay him in dogecoins, seeing as how he's a shibe?
No longer I'm afraid. Heard it passed away a few days ago.
If any of you guys play Genshin Impact in the last Big Expansion Update, there was a Shiba named [Taroumaru ](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Taroumaru) I think it was paying tribute to the real one that you see in the vid
Where
but now I'm sad I can't visit that amazing doggie

(Japanese aren't too keen on foreigners in the best of times, right now they are downright terrified with only 9% of population fully vaxxed)
Still sad the dog at this store actually passed away
“And you total will be 4 pets,sir”
"Is this what humans call workplace harassment? hmph"
World Of Horror
Pretty sure he died a few years ago :(
Goods in exchange for rubs.
I’d sink my paychecks into that shop for the sake of that dog.
This makes me even more sad bc the Dog has life figured out way better than me =/
Cucumbers: 50 cents. Only been bit once. Okay, maybe twice :)
I doubt he "owns" it. Definitely runs it. Maybe even stocks it. But "own"?! I have me doubts
That’s either an ashika inu or shiba inu either way he’s very polite
Why can't every business be dog owned?
I feel more sad he owns a shop and i dont have a fulltime job
Don't mess with me i am a shopkeeper!
The dog died recently
Grabbing the closest random object to show off because they're excited is definitely one of the go-to shiba moves.
I'll never get sad now that I have saved this
OK, now I'm less successful than a dog ... FML
This is why I love reddit.  Hits me in the feels when I needed it.  Also the dog has a better work ethic than me.
Anyone know what kind of dog that is?
This is my new favorite shop.
“Hurry up and buy!!!”
"Welcome home honey, are you okay? You look down, did they just pet you again and didn´t buy anything?"

"I don´t wanna talk about it, I´ll go to bed early, i had a ruff day..."
"Sir I'm trying to stay profssional in here".
Shiba gonna shibe.
its Taroumaru's cousin
Genshin moment
This reminds me of the shiba that owns a teahouse in genshin impact.
Imagine if the dog brings a dildo instead of a cucumber
And then the owner would be confused of where is the dildo
And then be sad again because Ken, this adorable little guy, passed away last month. 

https://news.yahoo.com/amphtml/ken-famously-adorable-roast-sweet-170014336.html



Your day can only get better from here.
This dog just wants to sell his cucumbers but everyone just wants to do the pet pets!
*why da dog living in the industrial society ?*
This dog just died two days ago btw
The way he holds that cucumber kinda sus 😳
i would be like "oo free food" yoinks the dog
Thank you so much for the support guys![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
No offense but he’s a dog and can’t own shite
Man Japanese sex toy shops have truly evolved. Kudos
I read in another post that this doggy actually just died back in June.  So this post has made me sad.  Thanks a lot op....
It’s feel not fell
How is the Reddit video player THIS bad?
Dog is likely dead now based on when this video was first shares.  😔

im not falling here
Please sir don’t pet the staff😂😂
Imagine the karma vitta got off this
How does he know to grab that 🥒 cucumber and what does he plan to do with it?
I feel like there’s probably a light novel about this dog.
He invented doge
Best boi ever 😭
sorry to break it to you guys, but from what I heard this dog has passes away. :(
Ah,it's a pet store.
I need to go to this shop 🥺
Very cute
"do you want the fucking cucumber or not!?"
Is this a form of haggling?
That will be 250¥, the cucumber is extra.
It’s retired for a while now
How much to eat?
owned :(
Which breed of this dog?
Used to* 😢
Can I just take a moment to comment on the awfulness of Reddit’s video player? What a steaming heap. 

Shiba is cute though.
kinda jealous of those of you who can fall happy
This dog died, even sadder now
One cucumber please "that'll be 3 head pats and a you're a good boy"
Human please go. Here take this cucumber, just leave. I have a family.
I don't know how to fell about the cucumber.
take your God damn cucumber and fuck off dammit
While I love this gif... It's pretty much as old as the internet.
Dog has veg if you have coin.
RIP Ken. He was the goodest boy. He apparently passed a couple of months ago but he left behind a wonderful legacy. All the proceeds from his store went towards animal welfare charities.
It’s a pet shop.
#DogecoinToTheMoon
He only accepts payments in dogecoin
I ma move to tokyo now
I don't even like cucumbers, but I'd lose all of my money here. All of it.

Not anymore ) :
Am felling sad

Nvm am happy
He doesnt own it no more i think
You pay him in scritches.
This could be a studio ghibli film
This just makes me more depressed, now I know a dog is more successful with its life than I am.
Dog: "Listen man, I'm trying to sell you a cucumber. Stop petting me."
Stop making me feel sad. Turns out it just died recently.
Can I eat the dog
Take all my money dogyy
I love in the beginning he was daydreaming and then realized “oh! A customer! *opens window* yes how many i help?”
Well i mean he DID own a store
Eating food that’s been in animals’ mouths is how pandemics start.

Might be going to Tokyo soon. I'm going to need the location of this shop to support it.
You gonna buy this cucumber or not, no loitering.
if they dont accept doge I dont think anyone ever will :-(
Now I am sadder as a dog is living better and meaningful life than me
But I wanted a cucumber - not a zucchini!
Instant 5 stars
Good to know that even some dogs are more successfull at running a business than some of us are. How uplifting!
Must take doge coin 😌
VGB indeed
This economy sucks man. Even dogs are more successful than me
Great, now I’m less successful than a dog…
Me likey. Me likey very much.
i would pat this paw and buy anything
I might fly there for this sole reason
Shut up and take my money
Don't pet dogs on top of their head, most dogs hate it. And most definitely don't approach a dog with the overhand palm
So this confirms me to move there
this dog owns a business and is doing better in life than me
Wat da dog doin
I don’t think it’s sanitary for a dog to be handling sex toys like that!
*How much for some gum?*

*About 7.50 pets*
Sheesh
How can I download this video??
Looks like a Ruff Shop
Id imagine teaching your dog and then posting a sign on all the commands people can give him to buy what they want.
Taroumaru is the best owner, no matter what Komore Teahouse's guests are scheming, you can't blame and arrest the dog for it :D Any human would be in a difficult position.
this is some men in black shit right here
I don't want to be a bummer but according to the official video on YouTube the guy who visited the shop said it had been closed down now for a few years or the dog might have passed away I think. I'm not sure.
Why is there a sign taped up on the window in English? It says "Donation Box for animals in need of support".
How does he pay taxes?
Cucumbers for pets? Worth it at any rate
u/erwin_cov08
I suddenly understand why the shopkeeper in World of Horror is a dog.
She has recently deceased 😔😔
A bottle of water please.
Yes sir, of course. Here is your cucumber.
No, water.
Yes, cucumber.
*sigh* not this shit again..
The dog retired a couple years back, the store no longer exists but I'm not sure if doggo is alive or not.
Sir! Customers are not allowed to touch the staff. I would bite you normally but I must sell you this cucumber please buy it.
But what does he sell?
Now this is a good boy
"thank you human, that will be 5 head pats please"
What a good happy doggy 🥰🥺❤️
Didn't this dog died a few days ago? I saw pictures of a shop dog's funeral like this one on Twitter the other day
I don't even own my home. Now I feel even more sad.
With so much petting he must be irritated by the end of da
I need a shibe 🥺 they are the most wholesome creatures on the planet
Sumplly cucumbder
This dog makes more money than me
This is adorable
I'm curious how feasible it'd be to train a dog to actually run a shop. 

Obviously stock/items would be limited but I'd think a dog would be able to manage 5 or 6 different items. Then just put an order with instructions for customers. Rig it with some RFIDs for payments and boom! Canine slave labor :(
You look like a lonely old lady with nothing better to do then bother me. Here's a cucumber. That will be treefiddy
If I met him I believe I would die of happiness.
Great. A fucking dog is doing better than me. Thanks dude
Stonks.
Is it a Corgy?
Gonna rob his bitch ass
I hate to inform you that this dog passed away earlier this year.
I was going to correct the title, but "fell into sad" somehow fits.

Omg, I'd buy there even if I didn't need anything, just to see this sweet puppers😍
What does he sell?
The dog owns a store and we are what's stopping us
Now I feel worse 

This dog is doing better than me
He is like "oh time to get my happy cucumber"
Sir, I can't pay my rent with head pats
So damn cute but such a dumb idea
Japanese dog has tentacle in mouth!
Pet Shop, (good) Boy.
business dogs are the best except for business bc they would rather get pets than currency
Omg I’m dying. I have a sheeb. So cute.
Dog food isnt cheap these days
Isn't that... doge?!
Doggo-Aight, that would be 50 belly rubs and 29 pets. 
Me- who's my good boi.. who's my good boi..

“Dis cucumber I scare cats away with!”

He really wants to sell that cucumber.
buy this hooman
So now even a dog is more well off than me?
Stick em up pup! Give me the money and I’ll give you a treat
So you just pet him and he forgets about money coz love is greater than money among dogs.
Which them makes me more sad because I realize that a dog is more successful then me
I’ve seen this so many times, but I will never not watch it.
This is a shiba right? Is it a specific kind? I think I’m in love. I want this kind of dog

Isnt that dog dead? Or is it a different shiba?
„This will be 20 Headpets and 5 Bellyrubs sir“

Is he hiring?

Are buying this shit or not
Shop closed in 2017 I believe. Doggo le retired.
Haha stupid dog how can you know the correct amount to ask for
Is it a petting booth? I need nothing just wanna pet that dog.
He died though.
If you want to be sad, I think I remember this doggo dying in the news recently, or retired
Shoplifters will be eaten
I am already sad that I am a failure and then OP shows me a video of a dog who have its own shop. 😑.

I am kidding, thats so freaking cute! Would love it if there's such shop near me
We don't have even people as clever as this dog, I'm impressed! 🤗
Haha, the guy thinks if he pets him enough, the dog will give him a discount on bamboo, and the dog is clearly sticking to the posted price!

One of my dreams for my dog is that one day I can buy a little marijuana café shop, and make a lil window for my dog to sit by and watch people come and go
His wares include: cucumber-13 pats

Dog toy - 50 pats (it’s his favorite one)
Wait, Dog Shop is real? I thought that was just a thing from World of Horror.
Weren't there a post a couple of days ago that said it died in 2021?
That would sadden me even more, because that dog is his own boss...WHAT ABOUT ME?![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)

Ohh thank you...a cucumber with dog spit and teeth marks on it....just what I needed for the salad.
that look on his face when he realizes that a customer had arrived
It is now my belief that this shiba has learned to assimilate your thoughts via headpats and thus get you what you need.
Dogecoin dog.
Does he take dogecoins?
Nothing better to cure sadness than to realise pets are more successful than you will ever be.

Sure, he's cute. That's how he distracts people from all his shady dealings. I don't have proof, but he's been spotted rolling around on the grass pretty aggressively. How do you explain that? High on drugs is how. Also, a friend of mine tried to get a job there and the owner laughed her out of the place. Whether because she's female or she's a cat, definitely has some discrimination issues there. She's got 9 kids to feed!

The ruff life of a Tokyo shopkeeper.
Worlds smartest dog
wrg, dog doesnt matter, idts
Its like if every house has a dog one day then people would be so humble and calm and there would be no fights.
If I feel sad remember this dog owns a shop in Tokyo?

It's supposed to make me feel better about myself knowing that I'm a failure but this Japanese dog is a small business owner??
This is wholesome as fuck
Dog must be feeling like:Stop fucking touching me. Take your fucking stick and leave.. I am busy
Awwww, made me sad instead.. That smile, reminds me of my old girl who passed.  The best dogs <3
