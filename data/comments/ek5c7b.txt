My pup had been begging the house cats for 6 1/2 years.  They‚Äôre still not ready for that level of intimacy
[This is what happens on the off days when Ollie doesn‚Äôt feel like giving kisses](https://imgur.com/CRlvHOR)

Edit: [here is their normal nightly routine :)](https://imgur.com/a/xbJ1yNh)
That scratchy tongue feels so good.
Accidental blep at the end. What a cute pair
This is seriously cute!
Aww she‚Äôs so gentle
Aww that little love nibble at the end got me

OP's over here replying to tons of comments and posting more videos/pics of cat and doggo. We should all strive to be more like OP

(thank you for this, I needed something light today üôè. and happy cake day!)
I just want to know how you have house plants! I have two and house plants hold no hope for survival in here!
So sweet! What a gorgeous pup!  Would she take human kisses? üòö
OMG that is the cutest thing!! Made my day‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Ya see my cat foods this but to only lick my pugs eye boogers off his face. Thats true love right there
Ended with a blep
Happy cake day
When cats lick other animals, it's usually a game of how many licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop, except they are the owl.
Please? Please! Pleasepleaseplease.
Looks like May my Carolina doggo.  Gawd I miss that puppy.
What a lovely pack of 2
Awwww this is literally all I needed to get through this day, thank you.
Omg, please tell me these two amazing creatures have their own Instagram?! I'd be their Num1Fan!!! ü•∞
kiss? please kiss? now kiss? cato can kiss? yes thank u
[Looks just like mine too, lab/husky mix, she‚Äôs also a big flirt](https://imgur.com/a/IT6VEo2/)
This is too cute!
Aw, I love her persistence‚Äî like ‚ÄòOh come onnnn you know you love me!‚Äô

Happy Cake Day and your plants are looking good btw!
Dog: "Please wash my face! I don't know where all those other dog butts have been."
Cat: "exactly!" (Then gives in because dog is so cute and persistent)
##meowtoo.
 I see a lot of people saying their dog looks just like yours, but seriously, my guy looks **exactly** like yours!

A male cat and a female dog. It's got me so confused but I love it!
Is that a tabby? He looks a lot like my marbled bengal.
Your animals are my animals doppelg√§ngers!
If there was subreddit for animal relationships, this would be sexual harassment 

Jokes apart very cute
When my dog gets too personal, my cat either runs away or gives him some claws-retracted skibbity paps
Happy cake day :)
More like sexual pawrassment, amiright?
Worth beggin forüòΩ
Aww they love eachother :')
Awwww üê∂üíô that‚Äôs just precious
I love all the extra pictures in the comments
Never seen a dog so thirsty! Yo dog, there are others out there! Know your worth, doggo
maybe humans exist only to bring dogs and cats together lol
This is one weird ass porno
Dog: (wants affection)

Cat: Boy, this dog sure wants to be cleaned a lot.
Is this the prequel to CatDog?
Look alike me and my wife
Happy cake day

u/psychopeanutbutter
Looks like Ollie is very tolerant!

It's sort of rare to see a chill cat like that.  It's so awesome to see one!
This looks exactly like my dog. Pink nose, long legs, little brown marks on the feet. My dog was a stray, do you know what breed? Photo evidence: [https://i.imgur.com/uoAzrO9.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/uoAzrO9.jpg)
That r/blep at the end!
You stank son damn

Awwwww so beautiful
r/petthedamndog
She looks just like my jindo mix!
Look at the blep in the end hahahah
Wow that was too cute!! It closed out my day on a very happy note!!
My dog licks the cat right in the eyes and ears and then gets sad when he doesn't cooperate
I like your cat. He is better than most cats. All dogs are great but sometimes cats aren't friendly.
that looks just like my dog!!! is her tail curled as well?
Cat - ‚ÄúNo, no, no.... fine.‚Äù
Dog - üòè
Fake, dogs are boys and cats are girls
Alright, this is it, pack the sub up. Nothing can top this level of Aww
Seeing the cat go from bopping the doggo to this is like animal character development lol
Please tell me these two have an Instagram. They‚Äôre so photogenic, and their dynamic is adorable.
This is one of the most wholesome things I‚Äôve ever seen.
That is so cute
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen
She wants the groomies
But the NIGHTLY ROUTINE, my ‚ô•Ô∏èü•∞!!!
Imagine how good this feels for the pup
I think she was going for third base at the end.
It's almost eerie how much your dog looks like mine. Do mind if I ask what breed she is? Mine is a Shiba Inu and Italian Greyhound mix.
I haven't smiled the way I just did to this in a while. I need pets.
It's so romantic üòÇ
Same. My dog and cat do this.  But they also clean each other's butts.
Aww üòç
How adorable

Cat now owns the dog. LMAO that behavior is submissive AF! "May I be groomed, master mittens?"
I'm always fascinated by pets who get along so well.

Can you say a little bit about how you got them and raised them?
This may just be the cutest damn thing I‚Äôve ever seen!
Okay people like to say: ‚Äúthis is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen‚Äù under every post, but this right here is LITERALLY the cutest thing ever
I am sorry I can‚Äôt stop watching can somebody help me?
*pet my head. GIMMIE KISS DAMNIT! GIMMIE KISS NOWWWW*
non consensual kisses
Okay this is beyond adorable!!!
Kitty fren
This reminds me of a HK drama where the two main characters fall in love over a long period of time. One of them has a cat and is coerced by the female MC into caring for a stray dog she picked up because her father hates strays and she can't keep the dog. 

The cat and dog falls in love throughout the show like their owners do. The dog woulf always bring the cat flowers and little gifts he picks up when he runs away to take a stroll around the neighborhood lol
You could make a youtube/twitter/insta just from these two.
How adorable!!
Its like when your kids keep asking and your just like "Here here here!!!"
Beautiful friendship
My begging my boyfriend for kisses
Please please please

Ok alright *cough* disgusting animal *cough*
I think you have it backwards OP, everyone knows  all dogs are boys and all cats are girls.
Interracial relationships???
My dates (always) be like
That‚Äôs so cute . I hate when the cat licks me üòû
Why do cats do this? Just a natural grooming instinct? My orange tabby used to do this any time I put my hear near him.
Adorable! What kind of dog is he/she?
Relatable
Adorable
Pure love.
Happy cake day
What kind of dog is that? Looks very similar to my dog that died about 10 years ago, but we never knew what kind of dog she was.
Reminds me of Mort(e) and Shiba.
This is SO CUTE‚ÄºÔ∏è It warms my heart‚ù£Ô∏è Thanks for sharing.
This made my day! Thank you!
We need more of these two cuties!
Cute
It's cute when they do it but Harvey Weinstein gets prosecuted

Hope someone kisses me like that someday
r/animalsbeingbros
excellent /r/blep at the end there.
Adorbs!
Happy cake day!!!
AMINAL FRENTS!
I feel like I‚Äôm invading their privacy. Which makes it even more fucked up..
Their little tongue sticking out at the end was the cherry on top of this.
Why peepl did dis.
Don‚Äôt cats and dogs have very different concepts of what grooming another‚Äôs face means socially?
Kitteh: I hate ever...wait man...I wanna hate everyone...dude come on..Ok bro..i got you..btw thanks I planning killing our hooman
It's cute and wierd at the same time lol
True friendship üòò
u/cutty-the-cuddlefish I showed my mom this video and she was awwing for a minute then said, "It was cute at first but it's annoying how he keeps asking." I told her it a 20 second video on repeat and she said "Oh."

My cat & dog do same thing! ‚ù§
This video reinforces my love of animals over humans. Heart warming!
I see that you are also a plant person like me! Mist that monstera extra for me today!
Is it a fact that cats express affection by licking enough to call them "kisses"? I thought it was primarily for cleaning.
so symbiotic and sweet!
I had a dog that looks just like her!  She was the best dog ever.  It‚Äôs been 5 years  since she died and I still think about her everyday.  She was a rescue - they told us she was a shepherd terrier mix.  We said she was an Oakland Yellow Dog.  What a great friend!

Forbidden Love
Our sheeb BASE jumps off the top of the couch and pummels the cat. There is rarely any love. I have caught her on a few occasions boopin snoots with the cat but he isn‚Äôt a fan.

Awwwwww!
Years of Tom & Jerry cartoons have left me wholly unprepared for TikTok.
She's such a good girl. Same as the cat
They're so precious! And I gotta say, I'm loving the plants showing in the background on those extra videos!
I wish my white German Shepard (she) and my Persian (he) got along this well but he just hissed at her while she states in curioisuty at him.
That is relationship goals. My heart melted at the cuteness

The blep at the end, tho
These two adorable creatures can make you good money if you use thier ig account well.

Thats really interesting behaviour imo because to most cats aggressively licking is a sign of dominance. Dog loves it but cat is using the licks as a warning sign.
This is possibly the cutest thing I've ever seen. But I'm also deeply depressed and alone, so I can't quite tell. Adorable, perfect friends either way! Made me smile even for just a moment, until I started happy crying :):(
My heart! This is why I love animalsüòöü•∞
Ok he's not asking for kisses - he's asking to get washed.
All my dog tries to do is bite my cats paws off. Sigh
That little tongue at the end is adorable! Not sure if blep or mlem.. :|
What do you call it when cat and dog makes a baby?
