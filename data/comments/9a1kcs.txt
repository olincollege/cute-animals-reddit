OP, I'm sorry to tell you this but... I think you are being catfished
Oh, so this is what a tiger shark looks like!
Get a leash and you have a chain chomp. 
Where can I find this shark costume?

I currently have a duck costume for my cat, but sometimes she likes to be more nippy than quacky. 
If this cats name isn’t SharkBait, it needs to be. 
Same facial expression and all. 
Kitty shark do do do do do do
Which came first? The tat or the costume cat?
Is that a cat in a space suit right above that lol
I'm intrigued as to which one is the tribute  
I'm not convinced the cat is loving it.
Not to be dramatic but I would die for that precious creature.
Cats in sharks all the way down 
*WHY DOES IT HAVE FINGERS???*
Well now I gotta go buy a shark costume for my cat

When this persons cat is better looking than you will ever be
Plot twist: its a shark wearing a cat costume wearing a shark costume. 
What a darling little face. It's funny how cute animals make me use words like "darling." 
Is this the cat that rides a roomba in a shark costume??????
Awesome! Scary shark 🙈🙈
Baby shark do do do do do do
I want a cat now.
/r/CatCostumes 
Kitty looks just like mine ❤️❤️❤️
Kitty looks like my kitty except my kitty likes to wear my pants when I’m on the crapper. 
This is awesome!
Annnnd now I want a catshark as a pet.
But is it [riding a roomba and chasing a duck?](https://youtu.be/Of2HU3LGdbo) 
Her whole arm is tats of animals in costumes? Holy crap that's pure awesome! 💛💛💛
Is there a story behind the shark costume?
r/disneyeyes
Better move on - its obvious who she loves most

I will never be as photogenic as this cat and I'm okay with that.
I feel you need a tattoo of your girlfriend holding her cat in a shark costume also including her tattoo of her cat in shark costume.   It would be the modern equivalent of an MC Escher work. 
BRB need to order a shark suit for my cats. My cats thank you in advance. 
That's adorable!
Ahhh so cute! I also have a shark costume for my cat, she looks even more pissed than your girlfriend's cat in it.
What a sweet kitty! 
The cat seems remarkably chill with this.
Real life pallico
That shark can attack me anytime.
r/thisismylifemeow
Pretty kitty
This cover for the new Jaws looks good 
I think that might just be a shark that ate a cat.
That cat is so damn photogenic 
If only the cat could appreciate the sheer dedication of that tattoo.
I feel like this girl has it all figured out. 
This is the cutest ever 😍😍😍
This is adorable as heck! 
Sweet kitty looks worthy of a cat tat.
She's a cutie! What a face.

Yes. Please tell me more about the cat and it’s costume. Pictures please and thank you. 
Her cat just KNOWS it's fabulous.
Am I the only one who wants to see the smoking pickle (below the cat tat)??!! 
Expectations vs Reality
Put a ring on that. Maybe marry the girl too. 
The new Palico armor looks lit!
What's the cat in the tattoo holding in it's hand?
Atlas Tattoo, Portland OR

Okay this is so flippin adorable I just wanna squeee!!

Omg is that cat the cutiest or what. I’m not the biggest tattoo fan but I really dig this! 
oh my gawd, that is so fucking precious
Should probably spend less money on cat costumes and more on a tattoo artist that does good work.  That tat looks like shit bro
[removed]
thanks for this cat
Who wore it better?
That is really cute.

Cutest baby shark ever 😁 
You should get a tattoo of this

This is going to be such an incredibly dated subject in another decade or so...like a rubik's cube tattoo would seem today.

Omg is that a ragdoll? She looks similar to mine!

Good thing it wasn't a pretend cat.
Jim Crow Shark.
What kind of cat is this? It's super cute!
Please tell me that she also has a tattoo of Sherlock Holmes.
Is that another cat-in-costume above?
Palico wearing Zamtrios. Nice!
Her eyes...

Definitely showing this to my girl, weve always joked that if her pet cat Lilo had a pet it would be a shark named Stitch
Precious babby! 😍

Real Hype beast

Thanks for posting!

r/2healthbars would appreciate this.

I'm convinced after seeing this and multiple other pics that cats enjoy dressing up in costume as much as we do.
r/tattoos
Pretty good tat work
Ur chick is gonna have one weeeeird looking arm when she's old haha
Omg my heart 😭 my close friend has been bugging me to make them a tattoo drawing of their cat like this but tbh I’ve never drawn animals, I did have a wolf/dog phase but didn’t stick I’ll take inspiration from this cute tattoo! P.S I don’t hate dogs just stopped drawing them in order to pursue a more popular phase at the time ☺️
that's fucking AWESOME!
Love the tattoo!! The style rocks! Where'd she get inked may I ask!? 
Impressive...
Best tat ever! Love the tat and the cat! 
The style looks like something from Mattias Adolfsson. 
Is that a minion tattoo below it ?
Purrty
This is officially my favorite thing ever 
I didn't want to upvote this.... But god damn, take it!!!
So cute 😉😜
In 20 years that tat is going to be a sad memory 
Wtf this is amazing!!
This should obviously read “my fiancé’s” and not “my girlfriend’s.”

Funny, I vaguely know your girlfriend and we are friends on Facebook. I actually showed this picture of her tattoo to my girlfriend yesterday after I saw it while scrolling through my feed, and now it’s on the front page. Awesome. Small world. 
Such a cute fluffer 
Awww this is the cutest thing I've seen in a while 👧😺🦈
And its the tattoo looks exactly like your kitty 
OMG that is so cute.

Double cutes. 
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU REDDIT THIS IS MY LOOD ACCOUNT
[removed]
Jesus. Cute cat for sure, but why the *fuck* would somebody mark themselves up like that? /r/trashy

I sure hope that nasty shit is a temporary tatt.

Men prefer debt free virgins with no tattoos 
Why am I being notified over this shit. ffs 
What a stupid idea
[removed]
Ok and now move on....
[removed]
This is still not enough evidence you have a girlfriend. 
Fooking hype beast man!
Your girlfriend is being catty.
I think i know your girlfriend! Are yall from AZ?
So trashy with the tattoos. 
Hope she never dies :(
[removed]
Is your girlfriend single?
r/GTAGE
How many damn times is reddit gonna tell me about this fuckin cat? Christ I get it, it's popular. Jeeeezus
No regrats
that is epic - I have a gf too

you good sir get an upvote for me, cuz we are kindred spirits in a way (both having gfs)
Unless the OP’s gf is InquisitorMaster, this seems like a bad idea. 
If this doesn’t make top 10 posts on this subreddit...
Bruh everyone has Bape hoodies now smh 🤦‍♂️ 
T
Wow. I'm so at a loss for words 
Awesome better if it was a dog though.
That chick has fish lips 
Tattoo is better than the actual cat?
WOW YOU HAVE A GF?!!!!
Looks like the tattoo artist was definitely a fan of Adventure Time.
That smile looks a lot like a person I once knew with the initials C.A.  The cat tat would be new, though (but last I saw her was years ago).  Probably someone else entirely.
