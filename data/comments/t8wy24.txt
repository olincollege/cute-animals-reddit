Maybe I lay down like doggie‚Ä¶. Nooope too close
That kid dresses better than I do...

r/HumanTippyTaps
‚ÄúYes, yes, doggo is very impress‚Äù
I'm 49 and I still react like that!
Hello Mr Dog. I will now dance for you.
Yo little man got the drip tho
r/Petthedamndog
It never occurred to me that a baby would be born during the pandemic and could be near 2 years old before they see a dog or a cat. Wow.

Edit: its weird how many people I've triggered with this fact.
Me at 26
I also applaud when I see dogs!
Little man is getting his steps in lol
i have a 14 month old and even though we have a dog at home, she does almost this same thing when she sees any dog. she LOVES dogs.
Omg the kiddo is so precious! The dog is so fluffy.
Oh, now _that‚Äôs_ adorable!
What keeps you up at night?


 Dog and baby videos.
I'm sure the sounds of joy are great in their own! Lil guy is so excited
Wonder if he had seen them on tv or something before.  Would think he would be scared if totally first encounter.
Damn someone show this kid how to pet the dog
How to duck does a 14 month old kid have more trip than me
This is exactly how I act when I see a dog in public and I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs.
Get this little man a dog!
So cute!
 happy dance, happy dance

Classic Reddit moment.

Also here's my [comment about the situation.](https://old.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/rccquy/kid_meets_doggy/hnuwcmz/?context=3)

But I guess stealing content and editing watermark out of it is alright now?
This is how I will alway react to dogs..

Dogs are the best..
I still have the same reaction. Just inside.
This is exactly how my fianc√©e reacts each and every time she see‚Äôs a dog.
This kid is the equivalent of those tiny kid skateboarders, drummers etc. But his skill is social intelligence. As a long-time dog owner, I am blown away.
why does this kid dress better than i do?

"WHAT THE FUCK S HE DOING!?!" - Dog
When do you start counting them with years
The kid moves like a puppet from Team America.
I'm genuinely perplexed about how he's gone 14 months without seeing one. They're everywhere. You can hardly step out of your house in a big city without seeing someone walking one.
Hahah just say 1 year old
He is 1. Just say 1 yr old.
I‚Äôm 469 months old and I react the same.
I have seen this before but that little guy is absolutely adorable so I didn‚Äôt mind watching again.
Repost BS
I am smiling.
Dog: "Well that's some might fine tap dancing I see there. Hey, Geoff! You see this?!"
The dog is like ‚Äúthis kid‚Äôs tripping‚Äù
I like how he went down to the ground as well. He see doggo as his equal ü•∞ pure heart human
dog looking around like does this kid need help
This might be one of the cutest things I have ever seen
I love that little dance lil‚Äô kids do when they‚Äôre excited.
It could be the 1st or the 100th time, this kid would still react the same way I reckon.
Kiddo that feeling never goes away üòç
/r/tippytaps
What's really bizarre is I know EXACTLY where this video was taken, I used to live right by this park!
His reaction at 14 months is the same as mine at 432 months when I see a dog.
I‚Äôm far too high right now and I spent way too long wondering how a 14 year old had never seen a dog before. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Pretty sure the kid is Chinese.
Sweet lawd, Asian babies are top-tier cute.   


The clapping and absolute awe on the face is making my heart cry.
Whatever past events led to it, i'm glad they did.  The gene for best friend recognized in both human and dog.
Guess what little man?! That feeling lasts forever, every good boy/girl out there is waiting for you
That‚Äôs how I feel every time I meet a new dog!
My wife seeing a dog for the 4,000,000th time.
Dogs are so gentle with kids, like my dog goes completely insane when I play with him or he meets someone new. If it‚Äôs a kid though he turns into this gentle, calm dog that just wants to play a bit.
These pandemic babies discovering the world for the first time are the best.
Dog: "Is this kid OK?"
Thanks, bot. The kid is probably 8 now.

I love it when little kids get excited and their feet run in place
This video so old I‚Äôve gone deaf and no longer hear the audio
Why the fuck can‚Äôt we have sound? What is it which this trend?
u/ana16011

So friggin cute
If you ever needed further proof that dogs and toddlers are the same, the tippy taps in this video should cover it.
This dudes parents are insufferable
Kids meeting dogs is just the best thing ever. Ask first, of course. I was at a bar with my brother and nephew and a beautiful girl walked in with a beautiful chocolate lab and my nephew perked up. He‚Äôs 5. I asked him if he wanted to pet it. He was nervous. I asked her if it was okay and she said ‚Äúyes of course she‚Äôs a sweetheart!‚Äù  Nephew booped her nose a couple times so I showed him how pet a dog. I got the girls number and won $500 on a pull tab. This actually happened.  That was a good day.
I have never understood why parents buy their young kids Nike shoes
Kid saw something that is not human but recognized the analogy to a human (it has a face, a body, and limbs), and decided to mimic it, before an aggressive nose poke spooked him and he bugged out.

A lot goes on in little kids' minds even if all that manages to make it through the output circuits is "bwaa".

We have more life in us when we are toddlers than we do at any other time.
Don't know what the big deal is. I'm 35 married and still react like this kid when I get the chance to see or pet a dog
Not about the content‚Äîfreaking adorable‚Äîbut I want to talk about the title because it‚Äôs interesting to me! The title demonstrates a difficulty it seems many English as a Second Language (ESL) folks have with English. A native Italian friend actually brought it up to me at band practice once. 

‚ÄúWhy is it ‚ÄòHe is 7 years old‚Äô but then also you say ‚ÄòHe is a 7 year old?‚Äô It‚Äôs confusing to put a singular ‚Äòyear‚Äô after a number like 7.‚Äù 

I had never thought about it before but the dude was right. That WOULD be especially tricky to remember when trying to learn English. Ever since then, if I run into an ESL person and a similar phrase comes up, they almost always make that mistake. Not knocking them‚ÄîEnglish is weird and hard‚Äîit‚Äôs just interesting to me as a person who taught English.
Can't believe I'm about to rip a baby's outfit but here we are

WHERE IS THE REST OF THE VIDEO!?! I NEED MOAR!!
Just amazing how much kiddo acts like a little puppy himself. So excited. Wants to be playful. Sometimes hesitant. Even the semi-jerky movements are similar. Guess we‚Äôre all animals anyway.
‚ÄúWell, tiny human, are you going to pet me or what?‚Äù
Oh that‚Äôs precious. Happy tippy taps
"Dog surprised he found a tiny human and wants to adopt the bouncy little one!"
That is a good dog and human of the dog.
fofito!!!
How adorable.  Neither one quite knows what to make if the other.
Drippy Tippy Taps
Omg it's a fraggle!!!
The kids tippy taps got me. It‚Äôs too cute.
The kid is so happy he's the one with the tippy taps.
Goddamned adorable omg
Funny thing is, I have the same reaction at 410 months old
Reverse tippy taps
That's pretty much me every time I meet a dog.
Needed this after the recent news cycles.  Thank you
He did the play bow AND the tippy-taps. Kid‚Äôs fluent in dog already.
my (once assumed) perception of a 14month old baby is not correct at all
I love how both dogs and kids have tippy taps when they are excited.
My son does this at 17 months old for our dog who has lived with us for 7 years now.  Calls our dog from his crib, follows him everywhere, feeds him constantly, and shares all his toys with our dog.
Haha that is awesome
This kid has happy feet.
I read an article that said dogs are like toddlers. 
To see this excited little kid do a ‚Äútippy-tap-dance‚Äù reminds me of my pups when they get excited. They do the same dance‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Little guy was gathering courage to pet the dog at the second half of the video.

But it's not the first time I'm seeing this video...is it...
Does he *ever* get to pet him?? I must know!!
Just say 1 years old
I really needed this today
Love this clip. Needs audio!

Hipster baby
better dancer and better dressed than me
For you people anal about years vs months: parents often refer to months because even just a couple months is significant in a child's growth and change at that age. In contrast, you've been the same shitty keyboard linguist warrior you've been for the last couple years, so you can refer to you're life on earth in years wasted.
Human tippytaps!
I do all these same things when I meet a cute dog for the first time but the owner almost  always calls the cops. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)

Damn I‚Äôm jealous. My toddler doesn‚Äôt give a shit about dogs and it makes me kinda sad. 

Our dog unexpectedly passed away in august. It was (still is) devastating to my wife and I, and I was unsure how to break the news to our son. 

Wellll it didn‚Äôt really matter after all because he didn‚Äôt give a shit. I may as well have been telling him I sold an old chair on Craigslist.

Kid learning that, yes, it is appropriate to applaud a dog. I still applaud my dogs.  Everyday
I feel this isn't the first young kid that this dog has met
I'm 37 and still have the same reaction when I see a dog.

This kid is exactly the Doug the dog from up, " I just met you and I love you" that dance is pure happiness
Well that's some of the good stuff about living on earth right there. Thanks!

I'm 58 and I get this way when I see dogs.
/r/FeelsLikeTheFirstTime
AWES!!!!!!!
The interesting thing to me is how the kid has the instinct to lay down before the dog. This is a way of playing/body language which he can't have seen before
Nah, this is totally a video of me every time I see a dog which is several times a week, not counting the dog I live with that is my best friend.
When do children stop being counted in months. 14 months is 1 year and 2 months so why is it still 14 months and not 1 year.

10/10 child meeting dog though :)
My first reaction was to stare at it as if its gonna destroy me any second
I'm 36 and this is still my reaction when I see dogs.
Came here to see cute dog comments, instead got to see people salty and upset because‚Ä¶ *checks notes* the kid is wearing a jean jacket, a hat, and sweat pants. 

Do we really have nothing better to do than gripe and act like the ‚Äúback in my day‚Äù boomers?
What do we want? The version with sound and a bit longer

When do we want it? Hopefully soonish. We'll check back again in a day or so.
I do the same little dance everytime I see my dog
14 months? That can't be right. I'd say 18 to 21 months atleast
this is the reaction i have every time i see a dog
Get that kid a dog.‚ù§Ô∏è
He got nice kicks
Kid probably does this every time he sees a dog.
I have trouble believing this is the first time this child has ever seen a dog, but sure. Ok.
same
Ugh that‚Äôs so fucking cute holy shit
Ots weird if you think about it. Most kids will cry/ and or scream when they see a snake or spider is nearby. Yet, when they see dog, most kids will laugh and are clearly eager to touch the dog. It amazes me
This is how I react to seeing dogs as a 324 months old as well. Some things never change no matter how many months old you are it seems.
NEEEEDS SOUND
Every time I see a dog.
This dog reminded me that there‚Äôs new Fraggle Rock episodes available on Apple+. I need to watch them with the kids.
Sometimes I act like that when I see a dog lol
To be fair I still react like this when I see a dog.
This is still me whenever I see a cute dog... I'm not usually that well dressed, though.
Lol the dog has no idea how to react.
This actually made me smile
i‚Äôm crying
Me inside every time I see a dog
Just the innate relationship between our two species is magical. I keep Bengal cats, some of the most socially-doglike felines, and they still don't come close.
Get that kid a dog damn it!
That is SOO cute ! I just love him !  Oh, and the little kid is nice, -  too.
I mean, this is basically me when I see a dog, and I've seen thousands.
The kid walks like it's "Team America: World Police"
This is literally like adults react to babies lol
What an angel‚Ä¶
The human is cute too.
Me seeing a dog for billionth time
He didn‚Äôt know what to do. So sweet
That is the cutest kid I've ever seen.
Yay! Lunch time. Is probably what he's thinking.  


That's a joke people settle down. The dogs probably been well fed so I'm sure he's not hungry.
This made me realise that i really want to have kids someday. That kid is so adorable!
They speak the same language of tippy taps
Baby tippy taps :)
This is the video that would stop the aliens from destroying us.
In all of this kids 14 months he never saw a dog, find that a little hard to believe? Or is this just figurative?
Kid is POGGED out of his dang mind.
What a well behaved doggie
That‚Äôs how I feel pretty much every time I see a dog
r/tippytaps
That's a little older than 14 months if they are making expressions like that. Most at 12 months aren't able to do that yet.
Asian kids are so much cuter than the rest
This is not the doggo's first rodeo. So well behaved around a clearly excited child.
TIL the reaction of a 14-month-old seeing their first dog is basically the same as my reaction to every dog I see
Also me seeing any dog, ever.
As a 372 month old, I still behave this way
It's just instinctual. Man and dogs were meant to be together. That's why I can't bring myself to trust someone that doesn't like dogs. Seriously.
Cute, i hope it get 69k likes
I wanna see him pet fluffy!
The dog‚Äôs like ‚Äúnow here‚Äôs an enthusiastic one‚Äù
I would react the same way if I walked up to a dog that could stare me in the eye from all fours.
That's how I see a dog every time.
The dancing is so cute!
>Video has no sound


This is a crime.
Awww happy feet!!
This is how I look every time a meet a new dog.
They‚Äôre both so well-behaved.
Well, I can shut off the internet for today. Ain't gonna see anything cuter than that.

I have a hard time not believing in evolution and humanity's close tie to dogs when I see this. But then I remember that a snake tricked a stupid bitch into eating an apple 2000 years ago and everything makes sense again.

Oh goodness me - bless that little love!
That face-to-face thing is how I got bitten. Twice. Don't let your kids do that. Or your dogs, even if they're "good with kids". A facial bite can be really bad. Just say no.

Young homie is SWAGGED out, I have that jacket but need that beanie lol
At 44 years old this is honestly my reaction to seeing any dog lol
Cute reaction.

I used to have a mastiff that I‚Äôd walk in the downtown area of my city.  She was a huge dog well in excess of 150 pounds.  On one of our walk we encountered a family with a young kid, maybe 3-4 years old.  The kid wanted to pet my dog so I put her in a sit.  The kid was loving petting her then my dog licked the kids face from the bottom of his chin to his hairline.  The kid was startled and turned away.  I was horrified expecting the parents to be angry.  They didn‚Äôt have a chance because the yelled, ‚ÄúShe kissed me!‚Äù  Laughing and turned and put both arms around my dogs neck for a hug.

One of many great times with the that dog.
"What is this magical beast?!"   


(this is also me, but at 41)
Humankind does not deserve dogs and I thank God everyday he decided to let us have them in spite of that.

My friend just posted a vid of her kids meeting a dog for the first time. You should have seen the delight on their faces over his wagging tail.
Or.. My wife seeing a dog.
The tippy taps
Me every time I encounter a dog.
really? has it been kept indoors in cage for all its life ?
That‚Äôs like every girl every time
So adorable
This legit made my day
Is it normal for toddlers to walk at just over a year old? I feel like I wasn‚Äôt walking until I was like 5
hope.
this is how I react every time I see a dog
Yeah, that feeling never goes away, kid. Enjoy it.
First glance my brain decided to picture him smoking a cigar
I imagine this is how wolves got tamed. Just smoll human interacting with smoll wolf.
I think it‚Äôs the doggo‚Äôs first time seeing a 14 mo old
Me every day
LOVE kids and dogs and kids and LOVE.  Nothing any better than the love from a dog and a child.  <3
Covid babyes
JUST SAY A YEAR OLD
Real talk- baby nephew had same experience 
This is when he could barely talk, he was saying to my sister: ‚ÄúMOMMY!! DOG!!‚Äù Over and over, cute as heck
Just cause it's reddit. I was expecting something horrible to happen.
Kid pissed his diaper for sure!  

His reactions are so cute!
The dog just looks back like,

"Is he charging up? I don't understand."
Only a Chinese kid could see a dog the first time at 14 months old.
Me seeing a dog at any point.
Me seeing a dog for the 184020472619th time
Just hug him!
Looks like NYC
So pretty much the same as when I, a 40 year old male, sees a dog. :)
What kind of dog is that?
Hey, did you see that kid just leave me hanging with the nose boop?  
  
What was that? He was even down on his belly. I mean who does that?
Why ppl say stuff in months or days.. I don't get it, just say 1 year old kid, jeez
r/humantippytaps
ngl I do this too everytime I see dogs lol
Good boy meet good boy
Drippy
Very rarely do I find the kid to be the cuter part of a video that includes a kid and an animal. This is absolutely the exception.
I love his reactions and even Dog actions is very funny
They're both adorable
Kids got better fashion sense that I do
me saw dogs at the first time in my life:
aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!
üé∂ "WHAT'S THIS? There's fluff everywhere! WHAT'S THIS? Tippy taps heard in the air!" üé∂
Looks like Sprocket from Fraggle Rock
Y‚Äôall guys act like he hasn‚Äôt already seen every season of paw patrol and isn‚Äôt hyped for this.
Also known as a one year old
I wish I could see a dog (and many other things) for the first time. Having the self-awareness of an adult seeing so many new things would be incredible.
At first I was wondering how you would get a kid all the way to 14 months without encountering a single dog, but I suppose we *are* in the middle of a pandemic so it does make a certain amount of sense. Man these last couple years have been weird.

Oh, and actually on topic, this is adorable.
Omg. Are they boty doing their own play bows??
May be the first dog and will not be the last one by any and all means!
Live footage of me when I see dogs
Me at 35 when I see a dog

Dog: Are you mine? I will worship you to the end of all!

Little Boy: Woah...........

Babes in people clothes are funny looking and oh so adorable
Place looks like Brooklyn
I‚Äôm in my 40s and I have the same reaction when I see a dog. ‚ù§Ô∏è
God you can hear his thoughts like AWE OMG HES SO CUTE- Wait I need to stay calm good boy good boy, I clap right? Yeah? Ok- oh uh hmm how do I get closer- lemme just come to greet him and- OMG HE BOOPED MY NOSE LIKE MAMA BEST DAY EVER, oh wait maybe he likes dancing- wacha cha chaaaa, rachachachaaaa! DeeDee deedley doooo. Aghh

I've seen 1000s of dogs, I have a dog, but I still have this reaction most of the time.
Nice baby
Can we talk about of awesome that kids fit is
tippy tippy tippy tap...downward dog....NOPE, TOO CLOSE!  quick, semi-retreat ...but not too far because DOG!

That‚Äôs the best looking meal he seen his whole life
why is he dressed like a hipster?
This is so old...It's super cute, but it's old.
I'm nearly 28 years old, and this is still how I greet a dog!
Dog seeing 14 months old kid for the first time.
My 15 month old sons favorite thing is "doggies". His favorite show is Bluey, and you can tell when he is thinking about dogs because he will be just sitting in his car seat or at the table and he will just start saying "doggie!" Even if none are around. It's hilarious. It's like he can't get over how cool they are.

We have three, and he calls two of them doggie while he says "Nowa" for the third because her name is Nova
I am 48 and this is literally how I feel whenever I see a dog!!
Nice to see an innocent happy child to help you forget all the bad stuff that are happening right now.
I do almost exactly this to any dog I see and I‚Äôm 342 months old
That‚Äôs how I am whenever I see any dog. No joke. I once broke my foot running towards a dog to pet it.
Dog: "HOLY HELL YOU SEEIN THIS SHIT?? "
I'm 24 years old and this is still how I react when I see a dog
To be fair, I'll be 40 in May and I still react this way when I see a dog.
This is me
Is that the kid from ice age?
he is too funny
And then my 1yo boy whos grown up with our golden retriever eats out of the dogs bowl and takes cues as to what patch of snow is safe to eat. Nature vs nurture
32 yr old me seeing a dog every time.

This toddler is better dressed than most of the people I know.
