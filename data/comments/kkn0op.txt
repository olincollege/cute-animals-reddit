‚ÄúMom. What‚Äôs this new kid doing? Are you sure you want to keep him...?‚Äù
Dogs looking around at the master as if to say is he allowed to do that and why didn't you warn us?
Aww the little grey one tattled! He looks up like ‚ÄúMooooommm did you see what he did?!‚Äù
My Siamese used to wait until her siblings were halfway through the cat door to the garage and then bite their back legs. Then, of course, she‚Äôd bop them when they tried to come back in. 

She was an adorable brat.
My cat does that to my other cat and the dog. It‚Äôs a hoot!

What a cat move
This is an s tier puppy
That pup was born to be a drill sergeant.  ‚ÄúI COULD HAVE KILLED BOTH OF YOU!  YOU‚ÄôRE NOT WATCHDOGS!  MOMMA‚ÄôS LITTLE PRECIOUS PAMPERED LAP DOGS IS WHAT YOU ARE!! DON‚ÄôT LOOK AT YOUR MOTHER, LOOK AT ME!‚Äù
I speak dog, they said:

"Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark"
That..is a cat.  Lol.  I love it.
Lmao!!! Took one out of the cat‚Äôs playbook ü§£
Damn I was waiting for the pounce! Haha I watch too many cat videos üòÇ  
(still a cute video nonetheless)
Love how the tail is used for steadiness and focus.
The cutest sneak attack!
my bulldogs do something similar to this. if the male (vinnie) is on the dog bed, my female (annie) will bark as if someone is here so vinnie will run to check the door ..... and then annie moves in to her spot on the dog bed. repeat as necessary.
Ha! Got'em!
This dog is part cat.
"I've trained you well."

I love to see animals exhibit a sense of humor. We had a cat once that had a pronounced sense of humor, too. It seems like such a human emotion that it's surprising to see animals do it.
The Jaws theme was a welcome finishing touch to this video... Kudos!
I love that look the other two give you.

"You. Fix this. Now"
That is not a puppy, that is a cat lol
I love that it just started to laugh the other ones faces it right after
Cat like stalking detected.
Better without the music. At least lower the volume for its barks.
They were not impressed
Looks like a new puppy is hanging out with grandmas cantankerous lap-dogs.
if they were cats they would've jumped 10ft into the air.
Don‚Äôt be suspicious, don‚Äôt be suspicious
He looks so excited that he actually managed to startle them
u/savevideo
What type of animals have we created?.............
That was great.
He's half cat
Jeez, know which one a these three to invite to the party
Is that a Shih Tzu, my favourite dog breed?!?!?
Watch the tail in stealh-mode... compared with after he got them.
One can argue that his grandparents are cats
Haha they both immediately look at human like, You see that? wtf wrong with this guy?
are we just not going to acknowledge the fantastic music editing in the bg
Aw, I thought they were from the same litter based on the description.
Wtf is happening with these floors?  Why are they aligned in this way??
They were just like

"Not again, Steve"
I love the ‚ÄúHA HA GOTCHU LIL BITCHES HA HA HA‚Äù at the end and they‚Äôre like ‚Äúuhh okay bud‚Äù
My cat does that to my other cat and the dog. It‚Äôs a hoot!
There is a cat in the house instructing in the dark arts.
That dog definitely has some cat friends
They weren‚Äôt impressed xD
The pain on the white dogs face lol.
gottem
That‚Äôs not a puppy that is Simba
The black and white dog is like ‚Äú why are you like this, Dave ?‚Äù
I didn‚Äôt know that dogs could laugh, this is amazing.
That's stalking. Puppy is practicing.
It‚Äôs like the two adult dogs are looking at the person who‚Äôs recording and saying: ‚Äúwhy did you get a puppy, again?‚Äù
Apex predator
I didn't notice that my thumb tapped the pause button a few seconds in and I sat here like, "damn it's like he's not even breathing!"
What a catdog! üòÇ
The determination in that tail on the sneaky build up, and the absolute joy after
Paws: you'll never nosey again
If only the other dogs understood the concept of a mirror.
Translation: "If I were an assassin you'd both be dead right now."
Reminds me of a stunt in basic. You get those cliques and friendships forming a  couple weeks in. Then, about week 5 people have lightened up, you know when you're being fucked with, it's fun.

So said group decides to fuck with a buddy on a Sunday. Laying in his bunk. The one thing you're not supposed to do. So they shark attack him. Entire barracks know because we can hear it. So I meander into the doorway (rolling pin barracks at Ft. Leonard Wood) and watch. "ATTEN-SHUN!" Swear to Christ a couple of them shit themselves. Good ol chuckle. They do it again the next week and the same thing happens except I really scare them, "AT EEEEAAASE!" I was as proud as that puppy is in this gif. So much fun getting the drop on people in good fun.
Fuckin got eeeeemmm
r/youseeingthisshit
We used to have two llasa apsos. They got old, but one was a few years older than the other. The older one went deaf, but figured out how to get the younger one to let us know she needed to go out. She never had an accident in the house. Dogs are smart!

But, the younger one got annoyed at always having to do her sisters bidding. She would wait til the older one was sitting, doing nothing. She would stalk up behind her sister and STOMP on her tail, sending her sister up in a spin. 

Then the younger one would go lay down. I swear I could hear her laugh.
"We could see your reflection the whole time."
What kind of cat is this?
Planning, foresight, imagination to predict a desired outcome and what looks like a sense of humor- that's one smart dog
Yo are these the dog version of the aristocats kitties?!!!!!!!
I've got two cocker spaniels.  The younger one does this to the older one all the time.  It usually ends with them chasing each other all over the house and making growly sounds, then one of them flopping on her back on the ground like "Okay, I give up, you win."
This is so cute! ü•∞
Mine does all the time. Just start randomly barking, others run to the front door like idiots to see if something is going on, meanwhile he nabs the best dog bed or spot on the couch
Whoa, almost hitchcockian suspense.
Tip toe... tip toe.... pounce!
Ok so that whole thing seemed way to thought out and intentional for a puppy. Also it shows it has a sense of humor. That dog might be a genius
Loved the way he snuck up on them, barken good.
Lmao, oh I needed that laugh today. Thank you. <3

Import to remember canines are predators too. Childhood is when they practice a lot of these instinctual moves.
Hahhahahaha
I'm sorry but that dog is really a cat. The tail completely gives it away. Find the zipper for the dog suit.
Those two ain't his siblings.

Do pups really do these things? Wow
I am seeing this as "What's the dangerous threat my friends are looking at?" And when seeing there is nothing out there, going "RELAX guys, don't spread that nervous energy!" "FFS, there is nothing out there, are you seeing your own reflextions? It's a window!"
We now know who‚Äôs the smartest in those three.

Haha! Ahh I loved the jaws music
In yo FACE
I had two little toy poodles. The bigger one always had to be near someone so she usually got the good spot in someone's lap or next to it. The smaller one would decide she wanted that spot so she'd start barking like something was at the window or door. The bigger one would jump off ready to attack. The smaller dog would casually take her place on the couch.
‚ÄúFuck sake derek the fuck you fucking fuck‚Äù
Wow beautiful puppies

He was just like howdy howdy..
Others like WTF..
My middle chihuahua does this to my youngest (both girls).  The youngest likes to sit on the back of my couch watching out the window.  The middle will sneak up behind her and bark at her, and she proceeds to fall off the couch and kind of ping pong between the couch and window.

That one's gonna be a handful when he\\she gets older. If he\\she isn't already.
Fuckin‚Äô kids
That was hilarious, they're so confused
He‚Äôs a naughty.
I saw wolf pups in Yellowstone and watched 1 lead 2 others down a hill to where their sibling popped out from where it was hiding behind a giant rock. So heartwarming.
 Looks to me like

Other 2 dogs: ‚Äúhey‚Äù ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that?‚Äù ‚Äúa squirrel‚Äù ‚Äúok keep quiet boss gonna shut us up‚Äù

New dog: *they gonna be so freaked out* ‚Äúoh fuck ! Squirrel ! Squirrel ! ‚Äú

Filmed by the cat
We had 3 adopted dogs, two which came a few years after the first. The first one missed being the only one so sometimes she would pretend to see something in the yard and when the other two went rushing out, she'd stay inside and curl up on the bed. She was a tricky old lady.

Aww so cute. üòÑ
I'm almost certain that's a CGI puppy.

Looks like he was cautiously investigating what they were looking at and barked once he finally saw it. Easy to anthropomorphize this situation though.
He saw his own reflection and barked at it. Dogs have no concept of pranks. Whats wrong with you people?
üòÇ
At first, I thought maybe s/he was easing her/his way over to make sure whatever they were staring at wasn't a threat that was gonna come through and grab her/him too. lol
Anyone else here just to say how ugly that floor is?
Setup. They could see his reflection
Wow, that's some big thinking ahead for a little pup. Better keep your eye on that one,  he or she is going to be a handful as it grows. I hope the owner is looking into letting it use that ability to figure things out now, because it could do great things. What a beautiful smart baby.
