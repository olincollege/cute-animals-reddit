Is this really too much to ask for in life??
Awwww... Ok that got me.
Three is not always a crowd.
Our dog thinks I'm her boyfriend and will purposefully insert herself between me and my wife like a tiny wedge, then start trying to lick my face as if to say "I found him first, goway"
Man, I don’t wanna get ludicrously rich, famous or be a ladies man, if I’m honest - I just want something like **that**.
My 55 lbs pitbull does this. It's just as cute but 3x as painful lmfao
I wanna do this with my girlfriend and our pet. Sadly I don't have a girlfriend, nor a pet.
god I feel so alone
Thanks for reminding me to cry
The perfect snuggling scenario
Credit: @julesbacarella
This right here is what life is all about. Having a laugh and a snuggle with good company - be that the company of a partner, a family member, a friend or a pet, just make sure there is emphasis on the "good" part when I say "good company". The simple, happy moments with others who support us are the ones worth living for.

I know many of you many be feeling lonely, especially during this lockdown or this time of year. My family and I have been using video chats more often lately because it really does emulate having company and makes you feel more like they are there. We have all of this technology at our disposal during this unique time, why not benefit from it and reach out if you need it?

If you had nobody to chat with, you do now. Reddit is a community just as well as any other, so why not start a pen pal (virtual or paper) chain here in the comment thread for those of us willing or looking to connect with someone who may be feeling alone? 

Take care of each other, folks. Recognize those good connections you have in your life, or try to build some. It is a very rare situation when the whole world goes through a lived experience like this, let's support each other as best we can.

If i fits, I sits.
Fits perfectly in my heart too.
The dog looks like he gives a little smile at the end. I love it.
I thought that was Justin Bieber for a second
That’s my sister in law and boyfriend!! They made it to Reddit!! So happy for them, i am not a TikTok person so i was waiting for this to happen since they blew up on TikTok, glad to see it happen!!
What kind of dog is that
He knows he is the missing piece to complete the picture.
I'm so lonely... .
*jealousy intensifies*
Justin Bieber... is that you?
Ideal relationship
He looks like Justin Bieber

This is all I want 🥺🥺❤️
Awwwww that is such a cute pup!! 💙🐶
Aww! I love that and honestly don’t know how I lasted so many years of my life without dogs in it daily. Our two small dogs are shameless cuddle bugs like this, too. The moment we get comfortable, they each know exactly where to fit their furry little bods into the family snuggle.
 ♪ Just the three of us  ♫
"ITS SO WHOLESOME!!!" 😤🥺
("Hes so fluffy I'm gonna die!")
I read ‘hits’ and not ‘fits’ at first. I was very confused.
Make room, Make room.
I need a dog and a human

This is so nice, I miss it. My dog and boyfriend no longer need me to cuddle. My dog gives me the stink eye if I intrude. MY. DOG.
My dog does this but he weighs 65lbs and jumps from a running start
Damn my life is sad
God, I'm so fucking lonely.
Chihuahuas are awesome. I was never fond of smaller dogs because they can be so yappy, but I now have a chihuahua/pom mix, and she's hilarious.
Stacks on!! 

... Gerrrrronimooooooo!
Give that doggie a tiny beanie

So cute! Cute couple cute ruff
Is it just me, or does this guy look like the store brand Justin Beiber.
Just as good, if not better than the original, without emptying your wallet
I feel like this is the definition of happiness
That is fucken adorable
We have a cat that does this. If my so and I are sitting near or next to each other, he sits on or between us to where he touches both of us. 

We joke that he likes the person who gets the butt end less...
omg you guyz are so perfect <3
I want a dog. And a boyfriend ☹️
I will never, ever be this happy
Ok that's so fucking cute wtf
my god,how sweat this is
Goalssss
Awww my ex’s cat would do the same thing. The cat could be grumpily ignoring us entirely, but if we started cuddling on the couch, she always jumped in.
😞been having dreams about having a GF and this isn't helping. Good for them but does it suck to feel lonely. Jesus :/

I mean, a lot of you have been dealing with this because of COVID and it's valid, on the other hand though I have been dealing with this for years. No friends for years, no GF ever in my life. It really hurts sometimes, I can live fine on my own but it does sting from time to time.
My dog does this when my wife and I cuddle in bed. She HAS to be in between us, and when we don’t let her, she just mountain goats right on top of us.
Good luck brother feeling your legs, arms and ass later on.
Cursed threesome
If he fit he sit
Life is tough.  Show love to the people around you.
“don’t mind me”
So.Much.Love
*Just the two of usss* *^(and the dog)*
That’s great. Love it.
Jajajajjajaja que bonito
This is the meaning of life
Can relate. Every single time my wife and I hug our pup comes running like 'HEY WAIT FOR ME!!!'. xD
Reasons i dont cuddle with my girlfriend and dog
#
50% is because i sont have a girlfriend and 50% is because i dont have a dog
2 dudes 1 goodboi
That is literally my cat whenever my bf and I are snuggling!
Is that Justin Beiber?
Could you imagine just getting to hold someone like that?
Our dog gets so jealous when my husband and I hug and snuggle.  He has to wedge himself between us, it’s hilarious!
Feeling especially alone now... I don't even have a dog.
I droped multiple single tears from both my eyes after seeing this
The dream
>He fits perfectly

At first I assumed the gf was the "he" the title was referring to and thought to myself, damn those homies are extra close
This is not safe for singles (｡•́︿•̀｡)
Couple: Awwww you are so cuteeeee!

**The Dog**: Good... you have served me well. now, assemble THY THRONE POSITION!

... good.
if there’s a human, i’m downvoting
I wasn’t expecting to get flexed on like this
My 150lb dog:

"Yeah let's do this shit"
I just tried this with my Great Dane. Then the other Dane was all like “looks like there’s room for a fourth!!”  We need a bigger bed.
My dog does this but she is a full grown golden retriever.
D'awwww, so cute. :D Relationship goals!
this is all i want in life
relationship goals
This made me feel more single than I already am. But thanks, I smiled as I cried.
I bought a perfectly nice bed for my cat but no, she decided the 2 humans I bought were a better bed.

HOLY FUCKING SHIT 174 WHOLESOME AWARDS
This is exactly my dog. Except my dog is 60lbs, so it's not as cute and it's more painful.
My 50 pound lab does this too. He does not fit. 😂
That is one wholesome three-way.
It's all fun and games until the dog farts in there.

My kitty does this all the time! She will not allow us to leave her out under any circumstances
Aww that’s heart warming. Also is that a chihuahua
"I wanna snuggle too"
If he fits he sits
My asshole Shiba will be in the furthest corner from me and my wife

In my next life, I wouldn’t mind being a dog.
My old dog used to lay on top of my fiance and me and eventually wiggle her way in between us every night.  It was super cute and I miss it so much.
Ah yes, couch cuddle time is one of my favorites as well
Also, "just the *three* of us."

whenever my bf and i hug or cuddle my dog starts whining and barking at us. can't tell if he thinks he's hurting me or if he's just jealous but he stops the moment we let go haha
Someone’s a Justin Bieber fan!
Alex peric is that you???

Is it bad that when I read the caption and then saw the bf and I was like "oh gah here this chick goes bragging about her boyfriend *eye roll* " and then OHMYGOSHLIttlEDoggIEHoWCuuuuTE
i need this so bad
Its like a cuddly Russian nest egg
The music's being like "♪Just the two of us♪".

Well yes but actually no
My little chihuahua mix always sits on my lap. When I am feeding the baby he always finds a way to fit in.
Happiness always begins with a hug from a bestie
It's amazing how he forgave her after she took his balls...
This is one of the best things I've seen all day
My pup does the same thing, so cute!

That’s just like my life! I’m the guy, and nothing else is the same. I’m 30 and single and living in Denver which is ranked by me the absolute worst place to date as a man. I’m just going to keep typing until the loneliness is gone. This is going to be a while. I’m currently watching the office season 6 which honestly who watches the office past Micheal’s departure? Terrible after that, I hated it. I still watched it, but at what cost... at what cost?

Anyone know where his beanie is from? I want one lol

I’m so alone
Awww my kitties would do this when I was with my ex.  We would cuddle and they would just try to fit in all the little indents of our body.
my little boy is like this
when i touch the bed for at least 0.00000001 second he magically appears and lays close to me so i can give him hugs and kisses

So cute. My 5 month old kitten does something similar.  If we're laying in bed holding hands, he'll come lay on our hands.  But he's a mama's boy
 But the song doesn’t match now
I want a family like that. With a big strong guy and a dog
Omg, this is totally my partner and I. They’re half my weight and shorter than me, so we could def snuggle like this... and their cat is a really big cuddler who likes to be around us all the time. Sometimes they’ll just grab their cat and hug him, and he’ll stay put in that exact spot for hours, just purring or sleeping.
So adorable ☺️

 Perfect cuddle puddle. My bf's cat, my bf and I made a kitty sandwich the other day snuggling in bed. Felix was so happy, purr purr purr.
Doggo cuddles are the best cuddles. My dog lays next to me in bed after playing with his toys. Then after a few minutes I hear him snoozing. It's more relaxing than those ocean sounds mixes.
