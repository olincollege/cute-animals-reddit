I also rescued a dog named Daisy, she was originally named Sassy but it just didn't fit at all. She eventually died from an enlarged heart but she was an old dog when we adopted her, we suspected that she had been the victim of neglect or some form of abuse as she was afraid of men initially. She came around though, we gave her a good last two years, she used to sit under the Christmas tree, she enjoyed Christmas.

&#x200B;

I think what I am trying to say is thank you for adopting :)
Hello Daisy. You have a very responsible daughter üëçüèº
She should look at learning to train service dogs. My cousin started doing it as a project in high school  and has kept with it for years after graduating. Started with just taking in partially trained dogs for socializing and command reinforcement and has moved on to do more in depth training.
You have raised a great child.

Daisy looks so happy and content. They both look like they're made for each other.

I made a drawing of this picture because I thought it was really cute.
Awww! So happy for you all... thank you for nourishing your child‚Äôs compassionate side :) I know daisy appreciates it!
They already look like close siblings! 
Your daughter is a keeper. You should keep her. 
If we all had this relationship with the animal kingdom, image what a world it would be. Excellent work you human, you're setting a great example for all of us.
Daisy already looks to-home.
Cool dog and a lovely daughter, what kind of phone you got though? It's a great picture.
My mom was adamant about not getting another dog after my childhood dog died.  I  waited a month before begging her and my grandma for 7 months straight until my grandma talked my mom into it for me.  The deal was I had to pay the $150 fee at the shelter and train her.  My girl dog was in the very last building and we knew immediately she was the one.  I'm actually really glad we waited for her because she was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome at 6 months.  I was diagnosed with EDS a year later.  We always seemed to be on the same surgery schedule so we were able to help each other heal and we both went through physical therapy together.  We got a boy dog 3 years later and he was my seizure alert dog until I had my brain surgery(cured my seizures).  Now he is my girl's service dog. 
The look in Daisy's eye says, "I'm home."
Where's the family portrait with all three pups!?!
Parenting done right. Well done on raising an amazing daughter ‚ù§Ô∏è
Omg - cute!
Your puppy looks like a Dutch.  If that's the case... I hope you're ready.
Daisy is in good hands.  üòç
That‚Äôs heartwarming! Hope your daughter has fun with your family‚Äôs new addition!
Malinois?
Aww, Daisy has sad eyes and she is hugging so gently. I think she will be a wonderful addition to your family.

It's great that your daughter saved up her own money to help with the adoption. I can see she will take good care of Daisy.
You guys might be interested in fostering. Plenty of dogs need temporary homes before they find their forever home. I foster dogs for a group and they get all kinds, from purebred puppies to old mutts, I‚Äôve even adopted some, it‚Äôs a great way to help a lot of dogs without eventually owning 30 of them. Half of them come in skin and bones and the shelters are about to put them down so by the time you are done with them they are happy healthy dogs and you can look back on how they came in and really see the difference you made.
It starts like this, and then your daughter is interested in other pets, and then she gets her own job, and now all of a sudden you have 16 reptiles of various kinds and a fat electric bill. Like my little brother.


But in all seriousness, thank you for adopting! There are so many wonderful creatures and kids who need homes, the world is a better place anytime you give that to them. Update in 3 years?
My cat Daisy disappeared 3 days ago. I've been looking for her to no avail :( 

Sorry for being so sad on this happy post. 
The best part of these is you can see the uncertainty in dogs eyes as they tentatively give trust to a stranger then a week later you get the update with the goofiest grins, carefree napping, or clumsy lap sitting. I look forward to the follow up pictures OP
I think most people have a huge heart for puppies lol
This is how best friends for life are made.
My immediate instinct was to scroll to the bottom to see the downvotes comments from sick people.
Very happy for Daisy and you guys of course! Give her a great life.
As everyone had already mentioned: Daisy and your daughter are adorable.

I just also wanted to say your username is awesome!
What a beautiful picture. That puppy looks really grateful. 
That dog has a very relieved look to it. Like the kind of look you get when you spend a long time in a situation where things could go really good or really bad, and then everything turns out OK and you're just exhausted and happy at the same time.
I lost my Daisy a week ago. She was the best dog. Hopefully your Daisy is as good as mine, OP.
Her coat reminds me very much of our rescue: https://i.imgur.com/8jvTdi9.jpg 

Daisy is **adorable**. Love it üòç 
DID I MENTION IT IS A RESCUE?!?!
That‚Äôs the look of a dog that knows it‚Äôs safe now.
The love in this picture in amazing! 
[removed]
Can we finally have a conversation about how adopting puppies isnt "rescue"? They were going to get adopted anyway. How about you "rescue" that old, ugly, and shy mutt that's ACTUALLY about to get put down
The way she his holding Daisy, it's so precious. This makes me feel great about our next generation.
Excellent job üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèº great cause!
Daisy looks like she appreciates the hand up. 
Blessing.
Daisy is lucky to have an amazing family‚ù§Ô∏è
Get her into obedience shows. Great training for the doggies :)
What breed is that? Such a pretty brindle color to that coat! 
Daisy looks so relieved /happy .üòç
Dog: "Home." :)
Daisy looks very happy to be going home 
When you get them are they already potty trained or do you have to work on that later? I remember getting a rabbit once as a kid and let's just say the ride home was a smelly one.
Dude is ok now
Wow so sweet
I always wondered what my rescue looked like as a puppy
Daisy looks like she knows things will now be alright :)
Love the coloring on this dog.
One of the most important things to instill in kids is that every life matters. This little pup has more than enough love to give. 
I want to rescue puppies and kitties but unfortunately I‚Äôm only allowed to have my current cat due to living situations. Even though it may be a long while off, as soon as I am living on my own and able to I plan on rescuing a few :)
What a sweet puppy. Your daughter is very kind. 
Daisy looks very thankful.  Amazing daughter to have such empathy for living things.
We need more photos of this pup. Her colouring is beautiful. 
Accompany each other
Think of it this way, it is waaay cheaper than if she was rescuing horses.
Daisy's a cutie!  Please us posted with how she settles in.  Thank you for being a rescuer!
I love dogs üíó
Awww. Looks like a great family dog.
Shes beautiful 

Edit: guys I meant the dog I love brindle shepherds especially at 6 months lol
Your daughter has a very good heart. You must be so proud ! 
Puppy rescue is wonderful. But, please don't forget to adopt the grown up doggos as well! They've been living a long rough life, and would love a forever home as well! 
I was having a bad day. Thanks, I needed this.
I mean. Once you've got two, how much different can three be? 

Jesus do I wish I could have a dog. I'd have six if I could have one. 

OP that pup looks content I hope all parties are happy with the arrangement. 
Thank you for rescuing. So many people don‚Äôt realize the cruelty in breeders. 
You should be proud as a parent of (at least) 4 sweethearts!
When‚Äôs no.4? :P
What type of dog is it?  My grandparents had one that had a similar color profile, but they just said he was a mountain mutt lol.

Very sweet and kind.
Super cute pup!!
The dog looks very nice.
Daisy is beautiful! 
How could one resist...
Good!
What a cute dog. 
Get ready for a 4th. She's gonna be feel bad when she sees two dogs playing with each other while leaving out a 3rd. 
This is awesome . 
Is Daisy a Dutch shepherd? She looks a lot like my childhood dog, Boomer. They‚Äôre an uncommon breed & we never knew he was a purebred til my stepdad saw a photo of a Dutch shepherd one day online & it just looked exactly like our dog. We‚Äôd had him 12 years by then and had no idea.
I wish my parents would of let me have a dog. Am 21 and cannot afford myself let alone another creature rip. 
Great colors.
Nice
I love my rescue dog she is a i think she is made Velcro she attaches to my leg when we go on walks
Love this.
Beautiful! 
Such a sweet looking pupper, and a beautiful story!
This is the most adorable pic I've seen here all day
That‚Äôs one of the sweetest looking pups I‚Äôve ever seen.  
OMG love
Your daughter is good people - that pup is in heaven. 
Your daughter is awesome with a huge heart. Also looks like she has an awesome grill lol 
Beautiful!
We rescued 3 dogs including one who lived under a car in Romania, a long story, all 3 have been the love of our lives. My Daughters have also rescued 5 cats along the way and as they grew older and left the house of course the cats remained...a very busy, hairy household but one we wouldn't trade for anything. A lot of love has gone back and forth between us and our furry family.
You're raising a good egg there hombre..thanks for posting, definitely needed to see something this cute and wholesome rn
two beautiful girls!!! my first puppy was named daisy too. hence my username :) miss her everyday!
I‚Äôm really quite curious how old your daughter is?  

Edit: yikes guys... wasn‚Äôt asking in a weird way...  why does the internet vilify a completely innocent comment. It‚Äôs really quite disgusting. 
Your daughter is an angel on the inside and an angel on the outside! I wish for these two to have that very special bond that comes between a child and her dog. My first dog, a rescued mutt with a broken tail, was my ever present angel that got me through polio when I was 2. His name as Royal. Blessings to all of you and a "royal" blessing between this precious child and dog.
Karen
Great girl. You‚Äôve raised her well. Wish you all and Daisy  the most happy life! 
Looks like a little Dutch Shephard, OP. Any idea if she is or not? 
This is a world class picture.

Y'all must be really good parents. 
You‚Äôve got a good kid, as I‚Äôm sure you know. 
Your daughter's compassion warms my heart. That dog is in great hands (literally)!
Whoa. Great photo!
Look at the beautiful Daisy.
You mentioned she is the 3rd.
How are the other 2 with Daisy?
They are so cute together!
SHES SO CUTE. What type of dog is she? 
We also have a rescue pup named Daisy. We got her 8 years ago and it was the best choice we ever made. Hope you all have many fun years with your Daisy pupper!
I love that this is where your daughter put her money. This gave me hope that more young people feel this way.
She has such a big heart. She's going places. 
your daughter is awesome. good on her. 
Your daughter is an incredible human.  I'm sure she'll do even greater things when she grows up. 
I'm anthropomophising I know, but that dog looks so relieved and happy that it's about to burst into tears. 
I see very kind eyes
Beautiful dog, beautiful heart. üòé
So sweet. The pups eyes are saying 'home at last'.
Daisy looks very in love with her new Momma! God bless!
Hey cool I just rescued a pupper named Daisy too!
Same coloring as my sister's cat üòç
That pup looks so freaking happy, she looks like she's about to cry, it's almost heartbreaking
That brindle, and that face combined, are absolutely adorable.  Daisy looks like shes gonna be the sweetest girl.
That hug is everything. Daisy looks so peaceful.
Sable Shepherd mix?
I‚Äôd that a Dutch?  If it is... buckle up for a wild ride!  Great dogs though!  I love my Dutch... most loyal dog I‚Äôve ever had.   But train early and often.
Daisy looks like she needed adopting...,forlorn look. She is a very lucky and darling dawgie. Her hooman has such a good heart. 
You have raised a remarkable child with empathy towards other living creatures in this selfie selfish world.

Kudos to you and your child-rearing and kudos to your kind generous beautiful daughter with the even more beautiful soul.

Thank you for saving this third pupper and another little life light that so many try to put out.

I wish for you both many blessings for your kind hearts.
Lovely pup and beautiful child 
Your daughter is good people. Congrats on having an awesome kid OP!
You‚Äôve raised her so well! 
Literally, tears in my eyes! The world needs more people in the world like your daughter.
Hopefully she‚Äôs the one cleaning up the shit.
Pup looks worried. Please post a pic when he knows he's in his forever home and is happy. You have a fantastic daughter!
Aye mate tell your daughter thank you, she is a wonderful role model for all dog owners!
This is great, love when kids are involved with pets.
Pretty amazing right here.
We need more people like your daughter. Tell her an on line stranger admires her.

It sounds like several of us rescued Daiseys. My Daisey May was a sweet beagle mix with soulful eyes and a loving spirit. We miss her. Enjoy your new puppy!
Your daughter is a way better person than most of us. She has a bright future ahead of her. 
This looks just like my dog Mia. Honestly it may be one of her pups. She had a few litters before we rescued her.
You have raised an amazing daughter. 
OP pat yourself on the back. You're doing something right as a parent.
Dogs and children go hand in hand
Bless her, the future would be great if more people had empathy like that
OMG DAISY IS SO PRECIOUS üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
Your new awesome pup has some awesome humans. 
That‚Äôs quite a cute doggy. She will have a great home. Good kid!
Someone willing to put that level of commitment into the life of another is a hero and she should be commended
Is sh interested in being a vet?
You‚Äôve raised a great daughter! Nothing better than helping rescue animals! 
My fucking heart üò≠üò≠üò≠
I‚Äôd be much more inclined to have kids if I could guarantee they‚Äôd turn out like your daughter. 
Your daughter reminds me of Zelda
Awwwwwwwwwwww. 

I‚Äôm not crying, your crying
Did people are genuinely good people. Well done!
Friends forever...
Is someone cutting onions in here? I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying!
You are raising a wonderful child. 
I encourage people to get rescues, they‚Äôre the sweetest things, if you give them love, they‚Äôll follow you to the bowels of hell.
What a beautiful picture. Two wonderful souls together. 

I often say that we don‚Äôt deserve dogs. Your girl, though, deserves all the dogs. 
love
That‚Äôs so sweet. Your daughter is a good person.
Your daughter is a good person. 
Adopting is the best!
My last dog looked exactly like that. She belonged to my parents and after about 12 years her hind legs just stopped working. She was also covered in tumors. They left town and we had a Vet come over and euthanize her to take her out of her misery. I buried her in our yard with our precious dog and two cats that we lost too. I like to think they‚Äôre all playing together somewhere better than here. Spitting image of that dog in this pic. So nice to see such loving youth. I hope you have many happy years. 
your daughter has a good heart ‚ù§Ô∏è 
You've got a good one there! She's got a big heart and a very sweet looking puppy! 
OMG, Love! üíú 
That‚Äôs beautiful.
If I had a million dollar to give you, I would so you can build a mini shelter in your back yard and adopt some more.
What a beautiful heart she has.
The world needs more people like your daughter
Your daughter is an angel.
You are raising your hooman right
So sweet. You can tell how safe she feels in her arms. ‚ù§
I LOVE THIS. Thank you for caring for these puppers! 
What a beautiful duo. That pupper looks so relaxed. 
Best post of the day.  Bless your daughter

The dog already loves her. Blessings
That's one great kid you got there.
Pet the dog then slip your daughter back her money she deserves a reward for being a compassionate person.
Daisy looks like a sweet pupper. 
Bless her.
You do know that your daughter is going to be a vet right? Lol right on for being a good dad.

So beautiful. Is she responsible for the dogs or do you do all the work?
I'm super late this post, but do you know what type of dog Daisy is? She looks just like my rescue pup Sloane. 
Oh my goodness what a beautiful pupper.
That is so precious and awesome for her
 Love the picture .
Did you actually make her pay? 

edit: sorry I asked a question, guys. reddit is so so cool. 
She's a good soul!!
You are a good person I hope daisy knows that she has a wonderful mom
Your daughter is an angel, and that dog knows it.
I see hope in that puppers eyes that this moment is for real and forever. 
Your daughter is a good person and I have a feeling that is a reflection on you. Good job to both of you. 
That is cool, congrats on having a big heart.  But 3 rescue dogs is the limit for a person/family, yeah?  
Your daughter's face looks like it says "You're safe now" while the pupper knows she's not going back to the shelter again. Congrats! 
Looks like the dog has a big heart for your daughter too.

Congrats on raising a quality human.
I have a Daisy too :D but my dog doesn't act like a Daisy at all lol. Thanks for adopting :D 
Very touching. Beautiful picture.. Thank you!! 
Bless your families heart!
What am I supposed to do with this puddle where my heart used to be? üò≠
Your daughter has a beautiful soul. Thank you for encouraging her gifts of compassion, mercy and a tender heart. I wish a wonderful life for all of you!

From a middle-aged ‚Äúcat lady‚Äù
You'll be alright Daisy, I have no doubt about it. 
True love!
That's definitely the start of a long lasting amazing relationship between dog and human. That dog looks so relieved to be in a caring humans arms.
How cute. Reminds me of when I was in fifth grade and had begged for a dog my whole life. I got a lab off Craigslist on my birthday and have had an amazing experience growing up together and always being there for each other. She‚Äôs past seven with a load full of energy still, but it hurts me to know she won‚Äôt be around for my whole life.
r/beforenafteradoption
Bless you and your daughter. Give Daisy lotsa hugs, kisses and scritches from me. <3
My heart <3
That is beautiful.
So sweet!!
That's friggin adorable. Thanks for sharing.
Reminds me of [this](https://reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9vqr2d/portrait_of_handsome_mother_fluffer/)
That look on Daisy's face is that of relief and hope
Daisy knows all is going to be okay now. 
The heart of a vet.
All she is doing is being an angel who takes care of other beings, carry on!  :) 
Adorable. You and your daughter are fantastic.
What a beauty of a dog! She looks like the twin of my boy, Charlie, except Charlie is all grown up and around 85-90 lbs now. He will run me over to get pets from my daughter. A kid that loves dogs is a good kid. 
That's so sweet. My daughter just turned 8 and she gave all her birthday money to the dog shelter. :)
You raised a darn good kid there! 
You guys got a good one :D
I need to stop scrolling reddit while I‚Äôm dicing onions.
Yes! Fantastic! Thank you for doing good by helpless animals in a cruel world. This warms my heart. 
Beautiful, what a wonderful spirit she has. I also adopted a rescue and we named her Daisy, though reading through the comments that seems to be a popular name now :) but they all suit it. 
You've got a golden hearted daughter right there, she gives me a lil more hope in our future generation. :-) 
Woowwww
That dog totally knows she found the best human 
You are such a good family to have such a compassionate daughter. Congrats on this new pup. Look at her face! She just looks like she was so scared and is clinging to her..but will soon know love. Awww.
Daisy looks very grateful. These animals, it‚Äôs ridiculous how much friendship they give. They‚Äôve been doing it for thousands of years, I guess. That was awesome of you to get one for your daughter. She‚Äôll have positive memories about that dog forever. 
Your daughter and Daisy are beautiful. Rescues are the best. üíïüíïüíï
What a cutie
aww that precious little baby
I suspect Daisy and your other rescues will have heinously good lives from this point forth. Also, you seem to be doing a good job of raising your daughter OP!
Daisy looks like she feels so safe and relieved to be in your daughters arms üòäüòäüòä
This is how you know your parenting skills are top notch. 
What a lucky dog !! Great job raising an amazing daughter !! 
You raised a good kid.  
bless her heart!
Beautiful
Lovely!
This warms my heart to no end :))))
Awh. This is so sweet. Theyll be best friends forever. 
You, you're excelling at parenting.  Well done.
Your daughter has a beautiful soul.  You should feel very proud OP.
Awww, Daisy looks like she's in need of those mondo hugs.  It's so sweet seeing how much she trusts her!

Your daughter is awesome!
Tell her she's doing the good work. 
Daisy is beautiful!! And I love how she‚Äôs snuggling in 
That's pretty adorable!
She‚Äôs a good person and so are you. That doggo is super lucky!
Your daughter is amazing. I hope she does end up doing something with dogs for her career, but I totally understand not wanting to be a vet. I feel the same.
OP, what do your other puppers look like? Do they love Daisy and all get along well? I‚Äôve always wondered how random rescued dogs get along in the one home after coming from different backgrounds. 
The look of relief on the pups face! They are both sweeties.
Very sweet
A child with a heart like that is due to the parents being awesome at parenting. 

Kudos, parents of this child. Kudos.
Awwwwwwwwww look at the way Daisy is snuggling her, that is so sweet I can't even deal with the cuteness 
That's so sweet! And that dog is so in love with her, I may have a little tear in my eye at work now.
Daisy knows she‚Äôs in good hands! 
looks like the girl i had for 2 months, Penny. so cute
There is a lot of heart in this photo.
It's our Daisy's two year adoptaversary. Looks like your gal didn't pee in the car on her ride home...

Sending love and all the best!
Good on her and you. Keep them safe from those PETA bastards.
Ever consider fostering?  
Someone should recreate this picture on 
r/ICanDrawThat
That dog just hit the jackpot. 
What a pretty pup. You‚Äôre daughter is a good human. 
That one looks like it's puppy sighs. Two sweet girls deserving of each other. 
Daisy looks so scared here. I bet she isn‚Äôt now. Good work. 
Fostering saves lives 
That's just good parenting.
On the pupper side and the kiddo side.
You've done yourself and your family proud. 
That is one hell of a human you've got there.
Keep on keeping on.
You have certainly raised a very caring young lady!
Good friends already
Omg look at Daisy's expression. Oh my heart
You have a great kid üòä
I just lost my cat who is also named Daisy. I hope that your Daisy treats you just as well as mine did for 18 years!
Parenting done well! God bless your family!!
‚ù§
Looks like Daisy knows where to find comfort. Thank you both for adopting. We have 6 rescue dogs and 5 cats, 7 if I may include my grandkitties. Does my old heart good to see this. 
Huge hearts often come with very serious medical complications... you should get that checked out
[removed]
She's really cute. 
Doggo is beautiful and your daughter is as well with those pretty eyes. This is adorable all around! Now I want to get my kids another rescue. 
[removed]
What a cute pupper! Pretty cool that your daughter has some dank gangsta grills too üòÇ
Good girl!
Teach her to be satisfied with the puppers she already has or she will end up one of those people with 25 dogs unable to give appropriate care to any of them
Faith in humanity = Restored
Just playing devils advocate, but this has the potential to become dog hoarding and later on, animal neglect. It‚Äôs great that your daughter loves/appreciates dogs & animals but it is a whole different thing to promote responsible pet ownership. Hopefully you and your daughter are on the same page when it comes to shared responsibility, i.e. taking care of the dog, feeding, walks, discipline, etc.

She is full of love....the pupper too
Both are beautiful. Congratulations on having such an amazing daughter and a sweet new pupper.

Here is my nice and respectable unpopular opinion. 

Puppies don't need rescuing 
Upvoated because of doggo and sweet girl
Was that near Sacramento? 
Looks like a little corgi mix 
What a shocker!! Shee wanted another puppy, and soon as the other one got old enough to not be a puppy.. for her inevitable fourth request, tell her she can rescue an adult dog
three dogs at once?  ever gonna learn to say no, op?
[removed]
We do not deserve dogs.
Need moar pupper
[deleted]
This is a beautiful picture. The girl's face is so gentle and determined, almost angelic looking. And the pup looks truly rescued. Someone should turn it into a painting, maybe without the car stuff in the background. 
I have no idea how you could possibly say no to either of them!

Lol what a wonderful kid, but you made her pay for the fee‚Äôs at her age? 
That's called " Cardiomegaly ". It's a serious condition, but can be treated with things like blood pressure meds or diuretics, depending on the underlying cause. If you have not already, I would strongly urge you to seek a medical opinion on your daughter immediately.
huge heart, only for dogs though.
Best pic ever taken.

You found a German shepherd puppy at a rescue? Come on reddit, that's not a dog you find at a rescue, it's a very very expensive purchase. 

We really should applaud people that rescue older or other dogs that otherwise aren't likely to get adopted. If this dog was from a rescue, he wasn't going to be there more than a few days. 

Edit: When you "adopt" expensive purebred dogs, you only encourage breeders. These aren't rescues, they are breeders under the guise of a rescue. If you want a purebred puppy, all the power to you. But don't get high and mighty like you actually rescued a dog that otherwise would have been put down. 

If this guy actually rescued this dog, I encourage him to post a link to his adoption page. This is just a picture of a cute puppy and his daughter. Which is fine, but the title is nonsense. My friends "adopted" a purebred shepherd puppy for $2400... from out of state... the thing is adorable but that's not rescuing a dog, it's a purchase.
She looks like Dakota Fanning 
Your daughter is an earth angel.

Sir, please don't let her get piercings at such a young age. That is still the age of purity.
