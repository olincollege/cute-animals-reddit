Our mail person gives my dog treats when we see them out on walks. Now my dog thinks every open sided big truck has treats for him 😂
Bernese mountain dog? These guys are so adorable!
Love the picture, you've really captured that moment! My husband has a friend with a dog who's always happy to see me, and that's the view I get either just before or just after that little guy absolutely loses his shit. Recently I bought him a little dog toy and I can't wait to give him it!

Edit: this is that little guy https://www.reddit.com/r/MrPuckett/comments/jtxfgh/cooper_the_kindly_soul/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share *and* schnoodled! We're both blessed!
Good dog!
I would let my dog out to see delivery drivers but she’s jump in their vans and want to go for an adventure with them. Little hooligan.
My neighbors lab gets so excited when she sees the fedex truck. The kid driving it will get out and play with her for a few minutes. It’s adorable.
I have German Shorthaired Pointers and a couple of our delivery drivers have them spoiled rotten. I have one driver who if she is on our road stops to see the dogs. The first time she was here I slipped up and didn't have the doggy door closed. Which I do since I never know what amazon driver is showing up. 

By the time I got outside, she was sitting in the driveway full-on playing with the dogs. As I got closer I noticed she had a few tears running down her cheeks, I immediately started calling them off. Turns out her Dad had GSPs. She lost her Dad a few months before, the last two GSPs he had passed on within weeks of her Dad. She currently can't have dogs where she is living now. So now she stops in every chance she gets to see my dogs.
I’m a UPS driver and I feel your joy
He looks like he just farted.
Just don't try to do his nails.
Aww what a friend
he feels like an older english gentleman for some reason. "would you like to join me for a cup of tea" is what i imagine the dog would say if he could speak.
Berners are such awesome dogs. Not only are they super cute but they love people.
My fedex driver always comes to the door with a treat for my chocolate lab. He goes NUTS when the truck pulls onto our block.
He just wants to know if you have a box from chewy.com.
I used to have the same dog, a Bernese mountain dog, very good bois
Bernnnnnns
Bernese mountain dog is the most prettiest breed. Period !
In my experience, Bernese Mountain Dogs live to see everyone they meet. They are the most adorable and adoring dogs.
When my son was in the hospital for surgery. He was only 2 & he hated being there so much. His mom or me had to be within his sight or he would have a meltdown. 

This really nice lady brought her two Berners into the hospital to visit the kids. 
My boy was nervous at first, but when he seen me & his mom petting them he relaxed. The big male Berner came up rested his big head on his bed, he started smiling & petting him. 

We were there for 4 days & he looked forward to seeing those dogs everyday.
You're probably delivering his BarkBox or something. Or is just an adorable floof who's happy to see you in general.
Most delivery drivers stop by my dog and give him a pet or a biscuit or toss his ball even if they don’t have a stop at my house.  You guys are awesome.
Berners are so awesome.


Berner parent obligated by Berner parent law to comment Berners are awesome under any post involving Berners.
Berners deserve this much glory.
Bernese! They have the sweetest disposition!
now i’m happy that you showed him to us!
Good bean :)
I don't think Bernese have the capacity to dislike anybody. 😊
I keep seeing posts of pet dogs being stolen and I'm paranoid by it. Is the only way to get peace of mind to get a locator chip implanted? Or do thieves have a way to deactivate chips?
My dog **LOVES** our UPS driver. Maybe its because the driver gives him treats or maybe its just because they are just naturally best friends, I will probably never know.
Do you have the box from chewy?  You have the box from Chewy don't you.
Awwww, so handsome, and you can see the love in his eyes.
I am as well and seeing the 20 or so dogs ( and 2 horses) is my favorite part of the day. They Bring me real joy. Dogs are very special beings. They are real gifts.
Your dog reminds me of our Golden Retriever who we had to say goodbye to last Wednesday. He was so loving to everyone he met and had so many admirers . 
Your dog is gorgeous! Thanks for posting
My girlfriend has a Bernese mountain dog!! One of the smartest and most loyal breeds :)
Bernese are the best dogs
Love me those Bernese Mountains puppers.  Do you carry treats?
I have a bernese mountain dog, they're the sweetest dogs
Bernese mountain dogs are the best: Friendly, big, fluffy, and sometimes a bit dorky.
You guys work so hard and we appreciate you getting our packages to us, especially this past year when I’m sure it got 10x more hectic & stressful. You deserve a welcome from every great dog!

Enjoy your day!
The FedEx Drivers around this area always carry a treat. The dogs love them.
looks like he's smiling:)
There's just something about Berners.
That, is one good boy
Lmao looks like my neighbors dog
These guys are so cute! Their pups are seriously like manufactured plushies. They're also a lot like Goldies in terms of personality
That’s gotta be the most symmetrical face I’ve seen on a dog in terms of multi coloured fur
"FedEx flooded with applications as the entirety of r/aww rushes to send in their resumes" Edit: Spelling
Love the breed just sad about their short lives
Tell him he's a handsome boio
Such an adorable boye.
The ultimate motivator
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
His design pleases me
You are the chosen one.
Humon has arrived with packages, good, good, my humon has be waiting patiently
It’s only postal workers they hate, 😂
Because his dogfood is delivered by FedEx lol
Look at him smile. Bernese are da bestest....
Man, you have the best job in the world! I’m so jealous...
Let me guess - he likes to lean in to your legs and/or sit on your feet :)
Such a cute smile. I really like this photo.
How do you have time to stop and take a picture?  I use to be a fedex driver and had to run every package to the door or else i’d be out from sun up to sun down.
Trucker here. I wanna know how you managed to see a dog while riding 50 feet off my ass and then passing me doing 70mph.in a 55mph like a typical fedex driver.....
Berners are made of love and loose fur.
I'm happy to see him
thats cute
That's a really beautiful animal.
You make sure you pet the pup and remind them  they are a good dog!
Berners are so dang cute.
What a beautiful dog! I'm glad he's friendly!
Dogs > People
Looks like he's plotting something and trying to act natural.
My first dog was a Berny mountain
Dog. Greatest dog ever ! I  now have a Boarder Collie. Greatest dog ever ! I have been lucky with dogs, having had eight or so in my life. Big dogs like the ones I’ve had are usually big softies . Right now, my buddy Zaki is in the shade of his favorite Magnolia Tree, busy patrolling the huge yard and greeting cars and people. He used the bed of the Crepe Myrtles like a race track so he can meet and greet. I really believe The Creator put dogs in the world to give people an example of how to get along. And I think we can all
be grateful for that ......
My dog climbed into the UPS truck and went for a ride before driver realized it was there. He brought her home after about 45 minutes.
My FedEx driver leaves milk bone cookies with my packages when my boys aren’t out to greet her.  You (FedEx drivers) guys are the best!
Bernese Mountain Dogs are the goofiest of boys. They want your attention so very badly.
r/DeliveryDogs

If you have fb there’s a group there for it too
I love Berners
My parents have 2 of these massive monsters. Can confirm, always happy to see people when they come to their house 😂
u/farmercurtis
I love seeing these dogs as puppies.
Give the boy his bark box already
On behalf of all of us with big dogs—like my German Shepard—who freak out when trucks roll by and go crazy when the delivery person walks up our driveway, I appreciate you and all you do! I apologize for our dog likely making you change your undies from time to time!
The goodest boy. I'd happily take a pay cut if my workplace had dogs like this
I was a Fed Ex driver in the 80's. Pulled into a rural residence one day and just as I was about to get out of the van, a massive German Shepard came running from behind the house, barking. He was outside the drivers door, barking up a storm, and I noticed his tail was wagging like crazy, so I opened the door just a bit, and stuck my hand out, and received a royal hand licking. So, I opened the door, and to my surprise, he hopped up in my lap and started giving me face licks. Just about then the owner came running out. She burst out laughing and asked if I liked their guard dog.
Hello, everyone with a package from Chewy sent me to get it for them. That's right, everyone.
Are you the fucker that keeps throwing my packages in the tree in my yard?
Lol. He looks like he is saying, “My Man, do I have a story to tell. “
My favorite part of being a delivery driver.

Although, there was this one dog, named Napoleon, who can go fuck himself. Little fucker put a couple tooth marks in the rubber of my shoe once... while the owner just stood there. 

I’ve never hated a dog enough to want to punt it into the owners face... until I met *Napoleon*.
that smile on his face is killer !!!!
I have the same breed and he is getting groomed as I type this.
Great!
This is the dog I want
As a retail worker, sometimes the littlest shit like a cute dog makes up for all the shit in the day.
I know this is r/aww but I really like his colors and the pattern of it too.
Omg I'd get fired. I'd be out there playing with that dog the rest of the day
"Pls gib chest rubs."
I always see dogs too!

I met a guy once that only sometimes saw dogs. I'd be like, "Look! A dog!" and he'd be like "Yeah right... nice one."  

I swear, half the dogs I saw he thought were invisible.
Is that a big smile on his face or is he just happy to see you..you should bring him a package once in a while with milk bones
Hello driver 

Has my BarkBox arrived?
Happi boi smily fren
Super duper cute
I deliver for domino’s and there’s one Rottweiler who comes out with her favorite toy to show me and to get pets
Must be the best part of your day!
I’m new to Reddit and you’re the 1st I’ve joined re: this post.  I grew up with a dog who could be a twin to this beautiful animal... you’ve made my day ! 🥰 Thank You !
I’m a fedex driver too! On Monday I literally got attacked by a dog! This 6 year old kid let the dog into the yard with him as I was delivering the package and the dog started running at me. I put the package between me and the dog, he bit the package, kids laughing hysterically and I’m backpedaling out of the yard the whole time. Truly scary
No address, but you delivered.

This post was well received. Thank you, Courier dude
Did you know that the Ex creates an arrow on the FedEx logo?
[deleted]
He’s waiting to see the mail.
Dogs and mailmen. Name a better duo
Crazy how a random Pic of a dog and a made up title gets 60k up votes and front page. This site kinda sucks.
I can't get past the "I work for FedEx" part. I hate FedEx. "We breathed fifty feet in front if your door for a split second and you didn't answer, we'll try back in twelve weeks." Yes, the 12 week thing happened to me. FedEx is trash. Cute dog, though!
And to think they have a brain size peanut. Or was that the chicken ?
Such a good boy!
Is that a shock collar?
He looks like such a proud parent :)
Boy, now that's a beautiful dog!
Y'all dispatch at a decent time today? We never do anymore
what a doll! just wanna hug that good boye! he's trying to show that not all dogs hate mailmen. that's just a vicious rumor started by cats to limit the doggo's belly rubbies.
The emotional intelligence of that species still delights and freaks me out after decades of being friends with them
Best breed of dog there is. We are on our third bernese and they are simply the best. Our current Berner, Misty took almost zero training and is the most gentle soul ever. I've seen her interact with small children and even babies and it is remarkable how respectful and aware she is around them.
In the thumbnail, he looks like a porg from Star Wars.
I know you're FedEx, but r/UPSdogs! (I looked for a FedEx version but there isn't one)
Are Bernese Mountain dogs related to Aussies at all? It’s amazing how he looks like a big version of my aussie. Same fur patterns, and the exact same facial expression when he wants pets!
I wanna put him in a video game.
Dude route pups are literally the best part of any delivery job.
awww. he's so precious
There's a great fb page called UPS Dogs. If you like seeing photos of dogs with their favourite UPS drivers then go join!
 so adorable pic ! very very cute
You are his friend! He missed you! You BETTER pet him!
Awww good boy
So cute!
Handsome boy. Big smile
Awwwww my great dane would try to eat your face through the window, meanwhile destroying my plants and window treatments. However, if he were to meet you outside of the house he would be hiding in my skirt.
He looks so proud to have his picture taken! 🥰
My peanut looks exactly like this just smaller since he’s a mutt!
What’s this kind of breed/fur pattern called
What a cheerful guy
I think he is hoping you are delivering his Chewy Box.
W00F
look at the sweet fluffy doggo! aww
What a beautiful connection!
The definition of a “good boy.”
You can see how pure his soul is.
So I adopted a dog like 6 months ago, looks just like this one, WHAT KIND OF DOG IS THIS?!?!
So cute
My dog looks exactly like this.

But, I'm sorry to say, he HATES Fed Ex drivers.  And Amazon.  And USPS.

I'm sure it isn't personal :)
Burmese Mountain dogs are the best!
Beautiful Berner Bear!!! They’re the best ❤️
Awwww I love to see him too\^^
Same dog different color. He’ll bark a lot because he wants to come see you and play but most people are afraid of him.
Even though its "the other guys..." there's /r/UpsDogs
OHHHHH CUTE DOOOG
Brother works for fedex, said some dogs get so excited to see him because they know he’s delivering their Chewy lol
That's a quality dog.
Berners are such amazing dogs!
Cute!!
I love the relationships my dog has with our FedEx and usps workers. I'm glad he brings done joy to their day.
Amazing picture of a beautiful puppy 😁♥️
A friend  had a Bernese mountain dog, that might very well have liked me better than his family. Every time I walked in, the dog would freak out with excitement and pee on the floor.
The goodest boy. So happy
My baby berner was at the vet yesterday for a small procedure and when I picked her up the vets and techs were gushing about how much they love having her in the office. This is the friendliest breed ever.
Lovely dog.
Bernese mountain dog great dog . Can be very protective to its family.
We have Berni’s too they are the best dogs🙂
That’s cool but when is my package gonna finally get to me?
That dog is loved. Look at that coat
He's so beautiful!
Wow, people are really loving this picture! That's alot of engagement for only 2 hours!
nnnice
Awwwww that's a good boy!
These are big dogs but so happy to meet people and super friendly. As a former UPS driver I’ve met a few of these dogs and they are always so excited to see you it’s like they’re going to explode from happiness.
cutie
Awwww what a cutie 🥰
I thought the dog was the fedex driver before rereading
Looks like the type of dog that would stick out his paw for a handshake and say: "HOW IN THE HELL ARE YA DAAVE?!!"
That is an beautiful healthy dog right there.
maybe he's watching you and waiting to see if you'll throw that package again like it's fucking garbage, like last time.
Dogs on the route are the best! It can get lonely/stressful, and they are always a bright spot
aww
I. Love. Dogs.
So cute! I’ve been keeping FedEx employees in my thoughts since the tragedy last week. Take care.
Awww!!!
This doesn't happen to be on a rural property in Missouri does it???
Me too. I made this one stop yesterday where there's a black lab puppy. That thing is monster sized now! He knew I was coming with a treat and he was jumping all over me to get one, almost knocked me over.
😍❤️🥰😘🤗 So cute!
He looks happier to see u
What a handsome good boy!
The white zones are for skritches and boops.
Dats a good boy right there!!
SO cute! He is even smiling, he does like you. Thanks for all you do!
Who's a good boy
She/he is so cute
If he's happy to see you... He's yours
What a precious baby boy!
Happy guy!
He looks so proud of you. Lol
Aww he/ she is so cute😘. What is her/ his name? Is he yours?
aww
Such a cutie!!! I'd never make it as a delivery driver because I'd stop to pet/hug every dog I saw.
When ur an eleven year old kid on the motorway * stares into ppl's cars* . The old biddies in the front don't look too happy with that so I stare out the window instead.  * Sees a FedEx Van* ( wonders " Hmmmm what do they do?)🤣
He...likes the mail person?? What is this sorcery?
Bahhh rammm ew? That’s it?

He's beautiful!!
I wanted a bernie so bad, but then covid happened!
He’s a very handsome young man. Who’s a good boi?🤎🐕🐕‍🦺🐾
That there is a handsome Berner
That is one of the most beautiful dogs if ever seen.  His coat is lhypnotic, and the expression is the cherry on top.
friendly customer
My best friend used to have one named Diggory and that boy was quite convinced he was a lap dog. He had absolutely no spatial awareness but was the sweetest thing ever!
Do you know if he barks at the UPS guy ?
The goodest boy there ever did was
He seems very polite ☺️
Don’t just stand there PET HIM
Whenever I see a picture of a happy dog on reddit while I'm at work, it really makes me want to go home and spend time with my dog.
Do you work for ground, or express? Do you like it?
That looks like an extra good boy ❤️
That's a good lookin' creature right there!
Also doing that slight backwards lean so that you have to get closer so that they can love you properly.
Our family had an army of Berners at one point in the last few decades. These are the kindest big fluffs I've ever met.
So cute
Who's a good boy
He's smiling...so sweet
What a beautiful doug!!
Caro hör auf mich zu stalken. Spaß du wirst eh nie aufhören
Man I miss my Bernese Mountain dogs, they’re truly the best
Would you say most dogs are friendly towards you? Or the opposite? Both dogs ive had for some reason are not too thrilled with the mailman but it seems other delivery drivers like fed ex ups etc etc, they dont mind them as much
My dog gets in the FEDEX truck! First time it was because she had gotten out and the driver was afraid someone would take her. So she called me ( # on collar) and my pup rode around with her until I could get home to take her. Now they’re BFFs!
Such a handsome dog!
He is totally smiling.
Isnt this a golden retriever in st bernanrds colors ? Lol
Im kinda amazed
Too bad he’s dressed like he’s working for UPS.
Thanks for being awesome 👏 My new mail person always stops to give my dog treats, and if she’s not outside, leaves treats in the mailbox.  I can tell you it makes her day just as much as yours.
This guy has an incredible sense of humor.
Totally looks like he's smiling. Bet he is waiting for a treat. :)
Have you met Tom Hanks?
His mouth is a perfect W!
Adorable 🥰
Majestic
That dog is absolutley adorable so cute ❤😍
I WANT HIM
Was he doing the front paw tippy taps? I feel like he was. Love when they do that little dance when excited
How cute he is :3
He looks like his name is Bill
The expression on this doggo is pure happiness.
My boyfriend is a ups courier and I get pictures of dogs all day. It’s the best
If reddit has taught me anything, that's the president of Ireland.
Do you Hail Mary packages from 30 feet away like my FedEx guy? Lol
Happy dog
awww
I am happy to see this dog.
Thank you for sharing and more importantly bringing all my packages.
What a happy guy! Love it.
He is so beautiful
If be happy to see that good boi too. Also the dog is cute.
Dogs look so adorably dumb sometimes. absolutely baffled by whats going on around them but just smiling anyway
Beautiful boy......need a big lap for him....
GOOD BOI
I used to drive for FedEx, and the dogs on my route are the thing I miss most of all
Reminds me of a dog on my route
What a gooooood boy
Dogs are the fuckin best.
Dogo dogo boi
A handsome fella
Who's a good boy?
I would be happy to see him as well🥰
Is it common for other delivery workers besides postal service to get attacked my dogs?
[removed]
Look at that Berner smile! Wholesome as heck! 🥰
Good boi
That’s a good boy
Super cute
What a polite good boy!!
M
He’s probably thinking one day you’re just gonna bring out a huge package of t.r.e.a.t.s for him.
He’s so cute 🥰
That is a good boy right there
What a good doggo... How can you not like dogs?
I have a dog
Love me human. Bring me treats.
I have one named bella
Berners are so sweet.  It’s heartbreaking they have a short lifespan (on average).  I miss mine every single day.
Always updoot precious boys!!!
he looks so soft!!!
15/10 good boy
What a good boy!
Handsome fella
My dogs on my route always bite me
As someone who works at people’s homes their pups are always the best part of my day
Such a good pupper!!!
He looks so polite
Looks so sweet and he’s adorable I’m glad he’s friendly with you😊💕
Good boi chain :)
Hasnt this been posted on reddit before?
What a good boy.

Bernese Mountain Dogs- the cruise director of the dog world
My boi will jump in a delivery truck to nose around if it comes up to the house, so I keep him rounded up if I know somethings coming. We live rural so he just hangs out with the others where he wants usually. Visitors are cause for great canine celebration. I love the text alerts so I catch the pack before a truck comes. Otherwise they'll run circles around it like a bunch of banshees. 
My main man Crest, chocolate lab, once climbed halfway up the ladder behind the Dish installer, which totally freaked the poor guy out. He saw a rattlesnake on that visit too, a Pygmy. Dang snakes. We never saw that service tech again.
Hello dog
what a cute dog
Bernese Mountain Dogs is legit the BEST BREED EVER! 😍🐶❤️ Have you ever seen a BMD puppy? They are to die for!
My favorite dog ❤️
Hey I work at FedEx as a loader. Thanks for everything you drivers do. You guys don’t always get enough credit
Ghf
That's just precious 🥺👌🏽
Always?!? Maybe you should talk to someone about that. Or rather "woof woof bark woof growl".
That’s so nice.  My dog loved delivery people too.  Once he got to know them, he would cry until they gave up lovins.  Dogs are awesome.
[Obligatory](https://i.imgur.com/dCoGidA.jpg)
That is a really beautiful dog.
The Bernese I had growing up was the best dog I've ever had. Loved everyone, incredibly protective when necessary and pretty smart. Not talking Lassie, but not like the box of rocks one of my current cats happens to be.
This is good and makes me happy.
Those Brows remind me of Mr. Levinstien from american pie
Someone delivers a lot of packages from Chewy, don't they? My dogs fell in love with the FedEx guy when we started ordering their food online.
He seem like he knows some shit about you... Some dirty secrets
Derp 100
Who's a good boy?!?!
[removed]
My sister's dogs were always so excited to see the FedEx driver who handled her route. Though he may have been bribing them with treats. They could hear the truck coming and would go to the door and wait to be let out before he even came into sight.
Exactly the way my dog (6yrAussie Shepard) looks when she hears the UPS van drive up.
Idk about you, but delivering to that house would make my day.
I’ll give you my free award when I have it.
If "hello there sir, sorry to bother ya" was a dog
I've got a 1.5 year old Bernedoodle. 

Most annoying dog in existence (I think the term is "shadow-dog," where they obsess over being by your side and having your attention literally 24/7—sounds adorable but it's actually very taxing), but her annoyance is matched with her constant love and faithfulness, so I'm cool with it.

Fair warning for those thinking about a Bernedoodle as a "family" dog: mine couldn't give any less of a shit about my 2-year-old son. 

When we got the puppy, my son was too small to give her treats, and she's COMPLETELY food-driven. As soon as she realized he couldn't offer her food, she ignored/spited him and just viewed him as attention competition. Knocked him over, shit in front of his crib, never acknowledged him. 1.5 years later, she still ignores him/shoves him out of the way to get our attention. I am sure this changes from dog to dog, of course. That's just my experience with the breed.
Keep bringing those Chewy boxes and doggo will keep smiling
Yup mailman here... Highlight of my day is when the dogs are out... Don't tell my boss
great breed. Super sweet
GOODEST BOI!
What a sweet pup
That's the cutest dog I've ever seen
Any insight on the happiest or most gentle dog breeds you've run into?
You might be delivering his treats/food lol.
Kick it and see if it be's happy😈😈
I love the smug derpy face he's making
WHAT A HANDSOME BOI
“Gimme the milk bone or get fucked”

Don’t trust him for a second, he knows what’s up.
The good boy of all good boys
 Nice
"Perhaps I treated you too harshly"-Good Boi
Such a gud doggo.
Aww baby
He looks so polite.  Seeing a random dog that notices me like that always makes my day.  I saw a dog the other day in petco to get groomed.  He was aptly named Chewbacca he came right over and let me pet him.  12/10 experience would do it again.
He looks like he's ready to hand you a medal of honor
I have two of them, Ted and Stan, and they literally will stop walking, sit and wait for the human they see walking up to pet them.
Noice buoy ❤️
Oh gosh I love bernese mountain dogs. they’re like tri colored golden retrievers! unfortunately they are known for not having a super long late span :(
Awww how cute. That's a great picture 📷
Happy 🐶
Lol he looks so silly I love it
Hi ya buddy
I also love seeing dogs on my door dashes.  And kids.
That has GOT to be the best part of your job! Xo 🥰
what a handsome man!!!!!!!!
Time to tackle a dog and give stitches and pets.
Cute doggie ❤️
He is bb
My favorite type of doggo 🥰
Oh my gahd I love heem
All the amazon drivers in my area of south east DC sprint away from the most gentle looking puppies,  with a fear of god on their faces.  

They think corgies are pitbulls.
He looks so happy. Such a good boy
That's a oooooooooooggguuubbboooyyyyyyyyeeeuuuuuuuggguubboooiivbooiibbooii right there
He's beautiful
His name is Hubert now. Can’t change my mind
i love him
My puppy(9 months)is very wary of people, but is totally cool with the UPS guy because he brings her Chewy.com boxes. She can recognize the logo on the box.
So happy to see you. I bet he smiles every time you stop
Chup dere fren?
awh so cutw
What a very happy guy
Tell him that I love him!
This is my dream dog ! My heart !
found my dream job
What a good boy
Our FedEx guy was here this morning. I didn't hear him and my dogs were out. I was so proud of my big GSD cross. She's so big and I worry about her biting. Hasn't happened yet but who knows what can happen. She didn't eat the treat he gave her but she didn't growl either. I was so happy with her. Her tiny brother rolled over to get a belly rub so everyone was happy! FedEx guys are great here.
so cute
Es maravilloso ver siempre un ejemplar que te quiere y te conoce...
O wow, a FedEx driver? I love FedEx now! All hail FedEx!!!
He looks like done something sneaky with that smile
My dog is always happy to see literally anybody who comes to the door. I get pretty ticked off when she goes out to greet someone and they ignore her. Looking at you, medication delivery man.
Thats no guy.  Thats a gal.
What a BEAUTIFUL dog !
Well I am happy to see him!!
Aww , have you met the owner ?
The dogs just thinking of whats in the box
Do you give him a lil snacky?
And I’m always happy to see him
Wait thats illegal
AWWWWWWWWWWW 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
My berner is named Lincoln and she's a goofball. Loves everyone!
I'm also a FedEx driver and I also have a friend just like him!
BABY!
Who's a boo boo head? *You're* a boo boo head!
What a sweet face!
I'm a van driver and the only dogs I get to see are the ones chasing after me buns.
What a healthy beauty. Snaps to this dogs owners.
One of the only animals that just truly Smiles without any reason sometimes, God they're to good for this world 😭
Ridiculously photogenic!
Make him a fedex driver!
Bestest boyo!
I could never own it one, due to the short life span :(
Made my day
so cute!
how cute.. he's kind of smiling
My favorite part of delivering food is meeting cute dogs. They usually are happy to see me. My favorite customer has 4 dogs.
What a sweety doggy
My dad has two big dogs that can be intimidating to delivery drivers at first but they’re big teddy bears. Since the FedEx man makes his rounds everyday he’s friends with them and one of my favorite parts of every morning was watching him struggle up the driveway while the dogs excitedly greet him and then he’d hop out to give them pets and belly rubs. Delivery driving seems like a tough job but I’m a little jealous of all the good doggos they get to meet everyday.
My dog hates you sorry
what a loving face.
❤️
Majestic wee beastie!
Awwww :)
It looks like he’s sitting there smiling😍
Look at that face!
always think of these dogs as wearing tuxedoes or like a shirt and suit at least  dont know why, they just look as if they are dress up dogs lol
“ hey looks like you got a package for me there”
And I'll bet, you're quite friendly towards him/her...Dogs read people vibes, facial expressions, etc
I’m going to join all the other comments saying berners are just the best. Sweetest disposition and gentle giants. I had them growing up and even people that were afraid of dogs couldn’t resist giving them a pet, they are just that sweet.
I downvoted OP because a FedEx employee stole my phone and when I submitted an inquiry I got
the run around. FedEx sucks!
That smile!!  I will never get any other type of dog after having a male (Yogi) and female (Abbie) bernese.  The only dilemma will be what gender.
Am guessing that you deliver a lot of Chewy dog treats to that house.
My trick for getting a picture like this is that I hold a dog treat to my phone and take a picture. But not all pictures I take look like this. I could post more pics when I get some
Look like the dog on my route that always jump in my truck going for my treat lol great dogs
Aww this looks like an elementary school photo! So adorable!

I’m a Social Worker and I love seeing my client’s dogs.  They’re so good for mental health.  Cats, too.
His smile! 💕🥰😄
Every Burmese I’ve ever met was happy jovial and super friendly 👍

Carry around a few dog biscuits to hand out and every dog on your route will remember and love you.
I wish FedEx would just knock on the door instead of getting more and more skilled at leaving less and less detailed doortags on my open doors... If you're not going to ATTEMPT to deliver it, then don't even roll up
120k up votes for a picture of a dog. Wtf.
Its the cookies doing all the talking...
It's either parcels or biscuits to feel that wrath
Good boyyyyyyyyyyyy ::: ))))))
nice smile:)
Um you got any undeliverable dog biscuits in there ? Do ya ! I could sniff then out of it would help ?
Winner
I’m a FedEx driver too! I want your route.
Smile
How beautiful....!!
That smile 🥰
Dude you are a fedex driver. Everyone is glad to see you
I bet you're happy to see him too :)
When I delivered in college I had 2 dogs and a cat jump in my truck. 

I always got shook down by the country  dogs for treats and the cat just loved chillin in the truck. 

Honestly, I love dogs and have one myself; most dogs are awsome and I’m super happy when a dog comes to greet me.

The ones with mean dogs are assholes, why’s your dog mean?
BERNER
He looks like that picture of Markiplier where he has 1000 necks XD (people who watch markiplier, yall know which one im talkin about :] )
This dog looks high as fuck. Clearly good boi.
What a great smile to be greeted with. Beautiful dog.
Oh my goodness those eyebrows!
post more of these pls ))
could you imagine this sweet pupper and you were super close in a past life like family or lovers or best friends and in this lifetime yall were reincarnated as a doggo and his mail man and his soul feels so drawn to yours even now and it just makes him so happy to experience your existence in this small way every day
He looks more suspicious than happy. HAHAHA! I’m sure he loves you.
Bless his little fuzzy soul
I was just on YouTube and watched a UPS driver stop by with a St. Bernard puppy and a Bernese dog like him. I couldn’t tell who was more excited. The guy or the doggos.
Show FedEx this post and ask them for a lot of money
what a beautiful dog.
SAwwwwwww
Such a handsome boy!
i love it
Bernese dogs have cute the trait of sitting beside you and leaning on you.  How did that ever get bred in?
Tell those people to dethatch their lawn
He likes you, because you are a drug dealer, and you don't even know it.
That smile
Does anyone know what kind of dog he is??
So cute!
"Hello old fren, how has your travels been this last month since I seen you."
Wow such a genuine face, you can actually see the smile, I love dogs :)
Big smile!!!
Awesome 👍
Hey what breed it is ?
This dog is adorable. I would love to see dogs constantly while doing my job.
