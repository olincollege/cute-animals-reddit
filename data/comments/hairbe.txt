Now that is one proud parent üëè
It‚Äôs amazing to see your child/children be in a better position than yourself and knowing you did everything to make their lives better. So they wouldn‚Äôt have to struggle as much as you did!
At the same time being a child that has parents that care and work hard for them is also something not everyone gets.
This picture reminds me of something similar I did for my father when I graduated from College.. My father and I have the same name and he was always a very bright student.. Unfortunately in his childhood, education wasn't his parent's priority, working the fields/farm to make money for the family and survive was the only long term goal.

He was immediately pulled after 8th grade by his parents to work.  Although he made a great career for himself in several fields of work, I know he always wanted to graduate; So when I graduated I gave him my diploma in a plaque.  We share the same name and I told him, this diploma is as much yours as it is mine for if it wasn't for your efforts I would have never achieved it.  He has it to this day in the family living room.

As a parent now, I will do whatever I can to better the lives of my kids.  My life has been made easier because of my parents and I only hope my kids also understand just how fortunate they are because of the struggles and fortitude of my father.  That's my main goal as a parent in life; to be better for your children to be better for their children.  That will be my legacy I leave behind.  


Edit: Awe, Thanks for the hugs and love Redditors.. Glad my life story touched so many of you.  When I go to my parents house I'll take a picture of me, my dad with the Diploma.  Maybe I can also contribute to the love even more.
Barefoot working and raising a graduate. What a stud.

For a second I thought the man was carrying a flame thrower. 
Then realized it was a device used to spray insecticides or stuff like that.

Took me a min. then I went ah lol That‚Äôs great.
Looks like he sprayed too much water
Man mugs women for her necklace with a flame thrower

Proud moment
Beautiful
I think it was staged. As someone from 3rd world country, event like this is really big for the whole family, no one will keep working in the farm, all family members will go to attend the graduation ceremony
Damn, reddit is a sucker for emotional pics.

This is a staged photo, by a popular Instagram star.
This looks like my country. Is this the vietnam?
I genuinely thought she was a ghost and he was a ghostbuster in low effort cosplay.
It‚Äôs daddy in a paddy with his girl who‚Äôs a graddy.
Damn she graduated and won a gold medal on the same day!
At first i totally saw Dorothy and the scarecrow
And yet he thinks "It is cool that you now have financial security but I wish you were here as we get old"
No one ever talks about the women that distract rural workers with their hat so they can steal souls using a pendant of nerul. This is important!
The epitome of the effects of capitalism in an emerging economy right here.
I wish farming wasn‚Äôt considered something we need to escape from...
Wish I could have this moment with my dad, miss him everyday
The thought behind it is nice but it looks too set up for me. It's all a bit too perfect.
These pictures have to be staged for social media
Reminds me of modern day Mulan!
Aw, come on, this is obviously photoshoped, look at the lightning of the man and then that of the woman, totally different tone. Don‚Äôt be duped so easily. Look at her hair, the hair is always the hardest part when cutting from a picture in Photoshop, and this one just uses a bit of blur to make it seem realistic. But the message is still nice, although I really question the motives of the man with his spraying apparatus...
[deleted]
I thought he was holding a flame thrower. I need to stop playing so much battlefield
Aww......

Both their skin and clothing are immaculate clean and well presented despite this being an "unstaged" encounter in the middle of the Vietnamese JUNGLE.
What did she win?
Source?
I didn‚Äôt fully realize this wasn‚Äôt a chef awarding fumigator a medal.
Good dad good daughter
This is incredible, it took me a second to recognize the significance. I‚Äôm sure your parent is so proud
The pride in that father's face.....
Job done. You did good, dad.
Every economist will tell you educating your populous is the way to boost your economy , and here we see that at micro level :)
The old Dad looks like he‚Äôs worked a hard life with few opportunities.  His pride is evident.
Holy fuck that's an amazing picture.
My high ass thought this was Dorothy and the Scare Crow from Wizard of Oz
Not really as I have no clue what is happening here
At first I saw the scarecrow from the wizard of oz being presented with medals....
Did no one else think he had a ww2 era flame thrower at first glance?
A picture is worth a thousand words, double spaced, MLA format.
It took me a while to realise what I was seeing - at first I thought that I was looking at the scarecrow from the Wizard of Oz!
I need the words i dont understand
Congrats sa pareho sainyo !
I'm just waiting for her to fall and mess up her white clothes
Welcome to the rice fields MF!
Modern day Mulan
This isnt worth a thousand words. This is currently worth 29.5K words.
Such a symbolic and inspiring picture that shows what a parent would do just so their children have better lives.
"Look at all my medals and sashes, poor man who couldn't afford to go to college"
Wholesome.
At first I thought he was holding a flame thrower and I was very confused
I‚Äôm so confused, does he have a flamethrower?
Mfw When you realise he's her sugar(cane) daddy
There is nothing wrong with that man‚Äôs career inherently. It is just about whether he is getting paid enough or not. And usually by the fact that people still do it years after year it likely stills pays enough for him even if it hasn‚Äôt for others who‚Äôve been forced to the cities, like many of our ancestors.

Congrats to his daughter though. Hopefully she went to a publicly funded school, as all schools should be!
# üíú
A video is worth 10k more
"You did this so I could do this."
How nice, she's giving him a medal and taking her hat off to him.
Seeing stuff like this just reminds me of how much of a disappointment I must be to my dad..
Hard Works Pays Off! salute to her parent!
He has a sword
Word
how much rice he had to sell for that degree?
Thats when you know, you did things right.
Cool
Immediately looked to the reflection in the water expecting a story there. But it was not in the reflection
It may symbolize success for Dorothy, but you'll never know how proud the scarecrow is. <3
Wow, this is really powerful.
wow
Thats what lifes all about, beautiful!(imo)
Looking at this upside down is even more amazing.
He‚Äôs living the dream...
Making your baba proud is the best feeling
X2 because of the reflection
 Yes, this picture contains a lot of emotions.
Or three: I am blind
For a second I thought he was carrying a Flamethrower.
Reminds me of LOST and Jhin
Awwwwwewww
It looks like Dorothy went and slaughtered the Wizard and the Lion to give the medals to the Scarecrow who killed the Tinman and was using his bits for parts.
That man is a leader... They rAre
I'm not crying, you're crying!
And a thousand stories
 But is it tho
At first glance this looked too me like a woman saying hello by tipping her hat, while presenting a freshly caught fish to a man.

Frankly I wasn't sure what to make of that.
Is that a sign of strength.
Jokes on you, I can‚Äôt read
I‚Äôm going to graduate this December. I just want my parents to have access to the best healthcare once I‚Äôm working.
As a son of poor immigrants, I get the point, but the execution is so corny.
Fair warning, am drunk, but legit didn‚Äôt register that she was his daughter and thought she was bragging to him that she graduated college.Was grossed out for a second b4 it clicked.
As one living in a third world country, moments like these are truly heartwarming.
This is what education and opportunity can do to a person, to a family, to a nation
Litterally the 5th I've seen this picture on this subreddit in 2 days
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying.
Aaaawwwwwww
Don't.  I'll cry
My mom and dad sacrificed a lot of things just to get me into my dream university. Their love and support were relentless; it knew no limit. It was a well that continuously sprung blessings for us. And now, I give my best in returning back the favor, even if they never asked for it.
This is really beautiful
i love it
Wow
So beautiful.
Upward mobility. That‚Äôs all us parents want.
It might be perspective, but that feels like a very narrow strip of land before they fall in the water.
That is a truly touching photo, a proud child and a prouder parent.

my only issue is what is he spraying?

This picture once again shows how important a good education really is
Philippines?

I LOVE THIS SUBREDDIT
aww???
is this loss?
Where was that pic taken? China ?
Badass flamethrower btw
I love this
Thanks to capitalism - countries that were populated by subsistence farmers for a thousand years+ now have a variety of gainful employment options, schools, universities, hospitals etc etc

A thousand words
"A picture is worth a thousand tears"
Oh help my HEART. He doesn't even have shoes on!
Oh gods my heart swells with pride of this young woman. I myself come from lower income parents. My dad was a horse trainer and my Mom was unfortunately disabled. I was the first member of my family to graduate college and I made a better life for myself. 

I know this young woman worked her ass off to get where she‚Äôs at and I hope it opens so many doors for her.
And now you too can join the 9 to 5 grind in a florescent office making someone else rich
This makes me feel guilty about my own college experience. The best I can say about it is that I do not have loans because I was on scholarship. Otherwise, a complete waste of time.
Why is she bringing him that hat?  He already has a superior hat.
How dare you make me feel these joyful feelings in my heart and chest area?
Oh my, my eyes watered pretty instantaneously..
he worked hard so she could have a better life than him, and that's what all parents want.
So... is he a ghost buster?
Cute pictures? Anyone?
This made me cry I'm so proud of her
The way the photo is set i figured there was an edit in the reflection. Kept looking for differences
One has useful knowledge and skills, the other went to college.
I‚Äôm not a soft man, but that really brought a tear to my eye... picture tells a whole story
As soon as saw that this guy was an exterminator, I got so excited
This is beautiful
Why hasnt the rice been planted yet?
If I'm not mistaken, many high schools use a medal to indicate valedictorian status, which makes the image all the sweeter.
Is it just me or does this seem photoshopped. The light and skin tone seem off. The hair seems off as well
I don't even know a thousand words

I am an American of Swiss/English descent, I saw my grandparents and parents in this.  The parents working to do better for their children?  I see that as universal.  The goal may be different (education/status/money/happiness), but the desire to have your children do well is all over the world.  The love in the picture is deep.
Great now get to work. Help me plant some rice.
This image fills my eyes, make me think of all the sacrifices our parents do for us.ü•∫
Reminds me of Jin in Lost
Why do these type of posts never come with a narrative or context? A picture is only worth a 1000 words if people can connect to its underlying authenticity.

I am sure there‚Äôs a wonderful story behind it but those 2 people could just as well be paid actors in an obscure commercial somewhere in South East Asia.
I thought she was holding a dead fish......annoyed he‚Äôd sprayed a chemical into the water. 


Oops 

(Very nice photo though!)
Then we find out that he is carrying a flame thrower.
This can only be possible when parents love their kids.. it‚Äôs rare nowadays
Nice. Soon on stock photo.
That man has had lived a fuller happier life than 95% of you including those enedubacated
The real twist? He has an MBA, expectations subverted!
medals are great, but in this economy. I wont be happy unless those medals are solid gold.
He has a sword in the reflection
That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about right.
How many paragraphs is that?
This made me instantly cry. Thanks.
So sentimental!
Ok but get ready to pick up whatever he is spraying this recession
Yesss I love this :)
Its ponyo and her dad
It's interesting that everyone is assuming that the older person is uneducated or the young person has achieved something he never did.   
In our world, opportunity and education are remarkably dichotomous.
A little bit staged
I thought this was Wizard of Oz
There is a saying in Hindi

"Nirdhan ka dhan Vidya hai"

"Knowledge is a poor man's wealth"

Knowledge of a skill or trade will take her to a better tomorrow.
These kind of parents are truly angels. They deserve all the happiness in the world
This is absolutely beautiful!!!
This is so nice beautiful, you can tell how proud! Kudos
When it‚Äôs this early in the morning, one word could have helped me understand a thousand times better. Where are my glasses...?
Is no one going to talk about the fact that his reflection has a sword?
I would read that book.
Unless that's he teacher and actual graduation. Then things change fast.
Isn't this a repost
Noice
And I know none of them, because I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking at
Just four words: I'm smarter than you
Great family!!!
We're assuming this is a graduation gown, but what if she is holding up Olympic medals for winning the 100 meter dash?

And dad is saying "Damn, u fast girl".
I love the PPE that the sprayers wear in rice paddies
As a woman and as a mother, this picture makes me want to cry. üíô
My parents are fantastic as parents but if there's one thing they're not proud of is me taking a gap year to get my head straight. Many, many years ago I passed my degree and they were never proud. Everything else though they were happy. I don't get it.
‚ÄúHa! See old man? I‚Äôm much smarter than you!‚Äù
While everyone feel wholesome I felt envy. For I could'nt do this to my father and I continue to carry this guilt till today. Hard-work sometime doesn't pay. Well at least for me.
This is a nice sentiment but this picture looks fake to me. The lighting looks different on him than it does her
I want to be this parent one day.
i don't know if this qualifies as aww, but i'm sure dad is super proud of his daughter and happy that she has the opportunity to be something besides a rice paddy farmer's wife if she so chooses. not that there's anything wrong with that. we need the world's farmers.
Pictures like these always humble me. Bitching about how bad i have it, then seeing those clothes and probably the age of the man just being happy for that his daughter can have it better then him. I just wish the world was more equal, in all kinds of ways. Hope they had a big feast together and some hope for the future.
Fisher graduate
My dad would‚Äôve been happy like this

I miss him so much
This made me a little tearful
Plot twist : She got her degree in agriculture.
If only my parents could be that proud of me
Clap x 1000 to both of them!
Zoomed in thought I saw the James Charles spider: https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQ1-TZS2fm-RoV2PO-PgtbMFF_mUOhvZfAEN97zdfru75o0ugAD&usqp=CAU
Cool.
Oh this hits me in the feels.
What is she holding? An Olympic medal?
Awwwhüò¢
I thought it was Ghost Buster for like 30 seconds there until I realized
This is so beautiful I just cried smiling üíï
Beautiful!
Reddit‚Äôs video player is so awful, I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm looking at a movie that won‚Äôt load or a picture.

Beautiful!!!
congratulations!!
He shouldve taught her tennis!  Much more profitable üòÅü§üüèΩ
Looks like owns a farm with a lot of land.
*one thousand words later* was it worth it?
Good job!
Congrats
TO ALL KARENS AND RACISTS, NO THIS IS NOT AMERICA THIS IS SOUTHEASTERN ASIA
Some of those thousand words should be "staged and pesticides"
Congratulations and thank your father for me. Was very happy to see this wonderful moment
I‚Äôm just curious about what he‚Äôs spraying with the Indian. I guess pesticides?
Yes, the picture is proor that we have become so lazy that we need overexplicit pictures to understand context and to be moved
He was happy until she said she has a Liberal Arts degree.
Yeah. A man spraying poisons. Sums humanity up very well.
What am I looking at here tho

A picture of 500,000 in debt
Beautiful. It reminds of **Lost**, and the story of Jin growing up in Korea. (spoiler) His father >!pretending to have passed so that he wouldn't be looked down upon!< as son of a fisherman...
Beautiful photo. Thanks for sharing!
I'm not crying. You're crying.
I'm kind of worried about the lack of PPE. Is there something he could plausibly be spraying where breathing protection wouldn't be recommended?
Damn he looks like he doesn‚Äôt give a shit

Edit: thx for the downvotes guys! üëç

I understand the happiness involved, but it's too bad so many parents don't realize that  most degrees are mostly useless.
Angry woman ironically gives medal to polluter.
Father: ‚ÄúYou need to reach your dream, study hard to become a Doctor. No playing, no dating. You do nothing but study until you become a doctor!‚Äù

Six years later, daughter returns to her strict parents

Daughter: ‚ÄúThis is the medal and degree that I became a doctor. This is yours, your dream, not mine. Now, I want to marry the man I love and be his side forever. I don‚Äôt care about this degree, and I want to be a housewife.‚Äù

Father: ‚Äú???‚Äù
Or a thousand questions

Now get him off that farm!

But why does he have a flamethrower
[removed]
What if she went hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt only to get a BA in feminist art history?  Then this picture is really saying

"Dad! I'm moving back home to live with you until I'm 35"
Woman congratulates the best rice farmer with an gives him a best rice medal.
we come to find out this is some rich girl walking around her family field bragging to the workers.
Wtf this lady is hardcore showing off that she is better than him.
"A picture is worth a thousand words" .. is it ? why is the young chemist in white lab coat giving medal and hat to the farmer ? Did he loose it ? Is it his wife ? Is he just random person to her ? Was this faked ? guess some words could be spared to explain :)
I see that a lot in asia they end up working in a mall or overseas as a caregiver.
so nice, she can abandon the family business to be unemployed in her local urban aera, progress
Who you gonna call?
*vietcong anthem intensifies*
Did she graduate from rice farming school?
But a word ain‚Äôt with a dime
also like the WHS is shit here, no gloves, no spray mask and spraying near the water.
hopefully she'll discover a cure to the cancer that is in that spray bottle.
Good job, dear. The CCP won't send us to gulag this month!
