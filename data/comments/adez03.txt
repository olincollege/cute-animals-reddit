That's great, hop was worth the wait.
That last hop reminds me of the Dino Game on Chrome when you're offline
That's-one-dope-ass-chicken 


     Come at me.
It looks like someone pressed “space” to make it hop
That little hop killed me 
Stop laughing she is trying her best lol
It’ll be level 99 in no time.
This made me cockle. 
I waited for the hoop and oh boy was it worth it. Considering becoming vegan. 
This is so cute!!!!
That is so impressive! Wonderful job in training your chicken!
Its got great Hendurance!!
Chicken: hops

Me: *how do I upvote a post a million times?*
Gobbles!
What a sweet little family time. I miss my family.
I don’t care how often this is reposted. That goddamn hop. ❤️
This video just turned me vegan 
99/99 Agility.
That was so stinkin adorable.
Wait, chickens can jump? Wouldn’t their legs explode?
Honestly did not know chickens could jump until just now.
Damn, that's one smart chicken. 😯🐔
Don't eat it please. 
[deleted]
i’m so glad i stopped eating these guys 6 years ago 
I liked the mid course peck for food.
gosh i love chickens
How I miss the days I had this level of imagination and patience
If I had a chicken I’d name it waffle
it hopped like the chickens in counter strike lmfao
That little jump ❤️
Hope it earns its freedom after this. 
99 agility confirmed
B o i n g
When you press the "X" button too soft 
Never thought I'd see a chicken with 99 Agility
I'm vegan. 
#How to train your Chicken 

#In Theaters February 30th
I’ve seen this a bazillion times but that hop never stops being adorable. 😄
New on NBC: Ninja Warrior - Chicken Edition
Watch as the first contestant navigates Mt. Midoriyama's death defying obstacles to complete the hula-hop!
how does someone come up with the idea "you know, it would be cool if we could train our chicken to do obstacle courses"
Good hop 
I don’t think I can eat fried chicken anymore...
Hens are much smarter than they look. 
STRIKE! (i think that's the chicken's name)

super precious, oh maaaan
1000/1000
Can someone tell my why these reddit videos always play for like 5 seconds, and then the video freezes but the sound keeps going? I’m on an iphone if that helps. Does the same shit on my macbook
It looks like a nice childhood
That chicken jumps like it's in ice climbers for nes
CHICKEN ARISE!  
The chicken has been declared fit to serve in the U.S. Army's special forces
Wow what an awesome chicken! I love chickens. I hope at least this one isnt killed 😫
GIVE ME MY SEEDS HOOMAN!
It's all fun and games, until Mum tell's us we are having chicken tonight.
that was so. fucking. cute.
The hop is amazing
This chicken is a great 
Its the little things in life that make it worthwhile, I was having a not so great morning but definitely in a good mood now.  Haha 
hes gonna be 99 some day
Thats a weird pupper.
Hilarious little hop
Love the hop.
That jump tho...
It's a meee, chickaario!
The laughter at the end. So pure ! 
ok the hop makes it.  love this thanks
Ducks next pls
That was more of a *boing!* than a hop and it was 20x more adorable
You have trained my brethren well young one
TIL chickens can jump
You have a funny feeling like you're being followed. 
Is it only me or is this an insanely old repost?
I too grew up in a small town 
trainning feathered dinosaur.
Sooo freaking cute! 😂💚
#hop
This is one of those posts that gets resubmitted every few months,  but I can't help upvote every time 
I envy it , living the simple life
Two things. Girl in blue laughing at the end looks like a Capcom animation. Also, the words "agility course" make me want to sit in a chair and grind for several hours through Seers rooftop agility course while watching Netflix, pondering whether I should invest in a bot to do the clicks for me, and have an internal battle about the morals of such a thing, ultimately deciding against it under the basis that I don't want to get caught, but still feel good about my decision and tell myself it was because I'm above that kind of thing.
Spoing.
I needed this today. 
'Dat clucker was a good girl.
That’s no chicken, that’s a winged doggo
Full points for that hop!  
**10/10!**
that hop is one of the cutest things ever
What happened to the chicken afterwards?
Chicken now has +3 on acrobatic checks
They’re faces at the end were adorable!
That was awesome.  
This is called luring, and is a really common technique for training dogs as well.
Great trainer! It was cute to see the hop.
I used to have some chicken pets when I was a child, they were so smart! 
Looking for the original? Or the source?

Best I could find:

I cannot stop watching that chicken jump. This is so cute. 
oh my god thats so adorable
Now eat it. 
Can't wait for the follow up vid where you tell her that you're eating Senor Cluckers for dinner.
That is definitely the best hop that has ever been hopped. 
TIL Chickens press A to jump.
Go vegan!
I've seen this so many times but that wee jump is the absolute best and gets my upvote every time. 
Waiting for that hop is one of the best decisions I've made
Reminds me of [NASA the jumping whippet!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15V7JhXfqbQ)
What a good girl.
That's one small hop for a chicken but a giant leap for chicken-kind 🐔
[removed]
imagine giving silver to such a blatant repost....
So cuute! At least this one won't be eaten
So cute!
This is perfect.
Obviously she’s trying to get the chicken to 99 agility.
Absolutely adorable & so smart! Good on the little girl & her mum (@ least I'm assuming she's her mum)!
I want to see a chicken hop into my oven.
Ohh so cute
Now can we eat it already
Its almost like chickens are sentient and we shouldnt eat them or something... weird right?
Super cuteee
I can’t handle that hop- it made me laugh badly!
Is this a thing? This needs to be a thing.
i've watched that hop more times than i'd care to admit. 
Now lets see the girl run it with the chicken guiding her
Need a "woof," at the end.
Jesus christ that's so cute lol!!!
aaaaand pop! 
through the hoop thank youp! 
This put the biggest smile on my face :)))
Love how she goes in for a little ground peck mid way.
You are a star!
It's getting ready for the canafis course
I'm surprised it didn't chicken out at the end
So cute and fluffy!
Timmy Timmy

Haha, glad I waited for the hop
Some chicken! Terrific! Radiant!
Bunnies
Boing!

I didn't wait for the hop, HAH!

I like how he takes a little pick at the ground at 0:06. Like he gets distracted for a sec
The chicken whisperer....
hahahahaaha
Thats just 2 fun :D
Didn't know chickens can be this cute
So if he leaves the course, do you call a fowl?  😎
TIL chickens can hop.
Amazing thought
Aww
You got my expectations high and even surpassed them 
The girls reactions, pure happiness.
I watched again just to see blue sweaters reaction.  
So good :)
I never saw this kind of parkour
Achievement unlocked 💗
Cool chicken. 
*boing*
Awesome and hilarious! 
Chicken deserves it
Spoiler...
GOBBELS! 
This was exactly as amazing as I'd hoped it to be!
That hop was smooth
Well, this just made my morning. ❤️
We have raspberry bushes growing and our chickens do this little hop to try and reach them
Why'd the chicken run the course?
I needed this today. Thanks :)
Hahah, I can’t even get my dog to do that!
This is crazy :D
This some country fair shit right there
Someone edit the most generic jump noise when the chicken jumps. 
The laugh was even better than the hop!
Repost. Still adorable as hell though.
Chicken arise
birds are so cute when they hop
Awesome 
That's the cutest little hop I've ever seen. Gets me every time I watch this ❤️ 
Boy that was one glorious hop. 10/10 worth the wait. 
*chicken tries to get food 
Amazing
That jump gets me everytime, it is so adorable and funny.
Chicken's Jump
New addictive game

Ah yes, this cuteness is what I need in the morning!
Good job!

Sprinkle a tiny bit of ultraviolet MDMA over all objects in the house, then light everything on invisible fire following these 83,000 simple steps in the exact correct order now!
Congratulations, You just advanced in Agility level.

Your Agility level is now 99.
ROFL
Arise chicken.

Chicken arise.
When the sky is falling
I want that chicken
Chickens are the bestest! 
WAIT FOR IT 😂😂😂
Bless my stars that was precious 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
The Usain Bolt of chickens. 
This little guy makes its velociraptor ancestors proud!
I've seen this a hundred times but I can't help but laugh at the hop every time.
If you put confetti right after that hop, I’ll pay for that show
Agility level?
Thank you. I have smile on my face! Great way to begin the day. All chickens go to heaven.
I just woke up and read tiny alligator course instead. I was disappointed we were seeing a chicken run it because I wanted to see the tiny alligator do it :(
This is great!!!! Now i whant to see it win a gold medal!!! Make it happen!!!
Cant.Stop.Laughing...! I havent laughed so much in years
Haha that lil hop, too cute!
**H O O P L A**
Some please meme the girl in the blue’s reaction to the chicken hop
I can't stop watching.  So adorable.
the hop killed me
God I love chickens. From that head bop to their little hops. So funny. 
That girl must have kids by now
DAY MADE!
First time I find a chicken to be cute.
Not alching while training agility? That XP waste.

With hops like that tho, will be 99 in no time. 
Chickalatta
Wow inredible
Cute
If I could get an animal to actually do that I would send it her way. I just love it when people freak out when it's the other way around. There is no need for us to have any animals at all. For pets or for food. We are evil and we are greedy. I'm not a hater I'm just realistic about things
RuneScape anyone??
Sweet!
The chicken is fun but the girls are adorable!  Thanks for sharing.
This is that chicken retraining to fight those 1,000,000,000 soldiers.
Hella cute
How much xp per lap?
I had to watch again just to see that cute hop.
$11 dollars
That jump. Wow.
Arise chicken! Chicken arise!! 
New agility course? 
zoing
That chicken is *way* cooler than me
Can we get this with a video game sound effect amwhen the chicken hops?
# YES !!!!
The hop made my day
You have reached agility level 99! Get your cape.
...too cute
That is hilarious and amazing at the same time. I had no clue you could train a chicken to do any of that. 
Watching birds hop is amazing. I have a bird and it always makes me laugh when he hops
Adorable!
Alley-op!
anyone that knows how stupid chickens are sees how impressive this actually is.
Good Colonel. Cayde would be proud. 
Half way to 100
There’s no way the hop wouldn’t have been funny. 

I hope they don’t eat that chicken.
Adorable 
Fuckin' RuneScape. Even chickens are on the grind now
That is the best thing I've seen all year!!
/r/oddlysatisfying
The girls laugh on the left made me laugh harder lol.
Same hop as the gif on the front page of that tiny man dancing with the regular size woman 
I love hula hoop girl's laugh at the end, says it all. 
I support
absolutely adorable and heartwarming, thank you for sharing that
Seen this before a get times but I’m not even mad the hop is worth it every time
ADORABLE
I had my phone on silent and I imagining it was all Mario sound effects, especially the hop.
Goals 
“So what.  He just gonna hop through this hoop.  Can chickens even hop?  Why am I still watc...  Wow!  That was the greatest I’ve ever seen”
The hop needs some kinda super mario sound effect 
To Ohio!
Who would win this chicken doing stunts?vs Good boy from other  post training to rescue things?
Boing. 
That jump in the end was just like MARIO jumping in the game!! 
The teenage elderly lady girl at the end gets me. Which are you, 13 or 64?
Someone please add the Mario "Jump" sound effect!

I wanna see a vid of this with bassrape when he lands the hop
GO CHICKEN GOOooOooO!
Wonderful hop
The chicken is cute
Hahahah! Thank you! I’m a grammar nazi... How did I manage that?
What a good boye and that little girl's cooing was so cute as well!
Too cute!

Hop definitely worth waiting for. 
Jump you fricken frick, you can do it
When you hit a cucco in Legend of Zelda... **hop**
Adorable! 
Girl in blue’s reaction makes the video for me. 
The hop is soo cute 
She's the next Chris Pratt.  I don't remember the name of his character from Jurassic World so I'm just gonna call him Emmet.  It's either that or Star Lord.
Dinner and a show!
**reminds me of the time I struggled for comment karma on a trending video**
That's a homeschooling family right there. Fo sho.
That girls voice is pixar-esque
LMAO.. The hop made my day.. 
that's awesome  good job girls
I wish *my* big sister were that supportive of my weird dreams/goals.
"GOBBLES!"
Boui !
Love it!
I thought it said tiny alligator course.
Oh how the mighty T. rex has fallen 
This is the first time I've seen it with sound. I love it.
I needed this 
Is this a RuneScape reference?

Mean..
Chickens creep me the fuck out
It's just following around her hand full of food.
How did I see the word ‘alligator’ in the title... maybe I should go back to sleep
But why?
More agile than Olly. 
Little Jerry seinfelds only getting stronger.
Fun Fact: Chickens have the same brain size as dolphins.
[removed]
Now the chicken is ready to compete against actual dogs...if it can complete the course before it’s eaten :D
Admittedly, it’s a cool chicken.
Lol that is as amusing as seeing a really obese person making a standing flip 
Hope a big chicken comes along and does that to you little girl
chicken isn't completing the course it's just following the food
I love cheese. 
I thought it was gunna jump on the spikes and impale itself lol. 
Ok this one is ready to have her mcnuggets harvested. 
Ok. Thats enough kids. The water is boiling. 
And then they ate it
Then they killed and ate it
