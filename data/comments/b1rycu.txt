He used his girth for good.  As a big guy for my whole life it’s always better to be the lovable big guy than the brutish big guy.  Use the tummy to shield your loved ones.  
Love the dbl guns at the end!! 
If anyone tries to bully that kid, something tells me #50 gonna provide a different kind of assist
Based on the traveling no-calls and the softness of the defense, I'm guessing this is a December NBA game.

White team appears to be the Knicks.
That's very wholesome
Get back on D!!!! /s
How about some love for #44 from the other team, who lays off the defense, claps when the kid scores, then tries to shake hands with him. 
Awe, are the kids’ jerseys numbered in order of height?  
I always hear people say that kids can be terrible... Yeah they can, but they can be fucking awesome too. 
r/humansbeingbros 
The #50  we need  https://i.imgur.com/z0r8sBY_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium
Honestly this looks like a good overall community. Even the opposing players are looking for high fives from the kid who made the basket. Good to see. Love seeing stuff like this
Always so easy to call out bad parenting... great job in parenting and coaching that #50.
my little brother suffers from spine issues that make balance really difficult. technically, he wasn’t supposed to walk, but by eighth grade he was the “sporty” kid and, while he wasn’t on any sports teams, he loved watching.

his buddies asked him to run in a race for their track and field day, and he agreed. mind you, my little brother can’t run very fast. he sways in the wind and bobs back and forth and typically falls more often than he was run in a straight line. but he did it anyways.

all of his friends grabbed hands and trailed behind my little brother at the race, cheering him on as he crossed the finish line as first place. he went to regionals. i remember when he told us at home that night, he cried telling us the story. 

at his graduation, during the valedictorian speech, they mentioned my little brother’s run, and everyone in his class stood up and gave him and standing ovation as he stumbled his way across the stage.

kids like that make my heart so warm. thank you for sharing this. 
Kids was raised right
I could only imagine how 50's parents feel in the stands.
Maybe it’s because I had my first child four days ago, but this made me burst into tears. 
My daughter is deaf blind. She had a friend like #50. It made all the difference in her school experience. They even went to prom. 
Of course everyone wants a friend like 50 but before that we have to be the 50 by ourselves 
I was the little kid in elementary school. I had a friend like #50. To this day not sure why the biggest kid in the class decided to befriend the smallest one. Thanks Richard! You were a good friend. 
Number 50, Never change kid, never change.
#10 has that mamba mentality 
He’s got his back!   Good parents
A boy like #50 saved me from drowning when I was in the 6th grade. I was a smaller kid. He had a body built  like #50. So we were on a school field trip one day and some kids went swimming. Due to lack of supervision and my own curiosity, I slipped and fell into a pond. He spotted me and got me out from the bottom of the water because I couldn't swim. I'll never forget he saved my life. 
What I love the most is that he's so selfless about it. He looks for no credit whatsoever. 
Whoever that number 50 kid is, hes fuckin cool. I bet his parents are proud.
I wish number 50 the best possible life, a true protector of good.
I love crying at 9:36 AM, hungover as shit 
There was a lot of good in this video, like the defenders letting it happen. A lot of decent kids right there. 
I’d be so proud of 50 was my kid. 
I know this is going to get lost in the sea of comments but my brother is somewhat physically disabled and on the smaller side but still plays on a regular middle school baseball team. This warms my heart so much because I worry about him getting picked on. It’s good to know some kids are good kids. 
Strong finger guns
Aww
#10 seemed like an ass.
Number #10 trying to take the spotlight
#50 is already way ahead of his time and many adults. Great example of leading by example. Rock on lil dude 🤙
Get back on D!!
Nobody saw #14 on the other team get rejected 😫
Big F  😢
and 20 years from now, at a school reunion, they're still best friends...
Buckets good and all but you gotta hustle and get back on defense man, don't let your team down.
My son's mid-level middleschool team did similar for their team manager who has some significant physical issues and limitations but who was their biggest cheerleader and entire heart of the team. Huge sports fan limited by the body his mind was given.

They had him suit up in the last regular season game and after they were winning by a considerable margin, late in the 2nd half, they subbed him in and ran a set play for him that they had been working on all season long. The other team didn't let up, but they ran the play FLAWLESSLY and got him the ball wide open before the 3 point line. 

To say the gym was silent as he squared up and while the ball was in the air is an understatement. To say it errupted as it got nothing but not is selling the volume and excitement impossibly short.

It was simply amazing. Nobody even ran down to play defense on the other end as they were all still celebrating and cheering.

I've been to A LOT of sporting events in my life of all shapes, sizes and magnitudes but I have NEVER experienced anything like that. I'm literally getting goosebumps retelling it now.


Fuck yes bro! If that was my kid I’d be a proud father. 
Traveling!!
😏👉🏻
The other team is terrible at defense 
Expected 50 to be a bully... I'm sorry
He probably saw an adult do the same thing in the past.  That's why it's important for adults to model the behaviors we want to see our kids doing.
Someone raised #50 right. 

All right, all right, all right.

😊👌🏻
Everyone also has that one friend who stays over at your house for too long.  #10
Refs missed at least 2 travels 
Damn, that kid is so young to be that fantastic... And to get back on defense! Whhhhhhat!? 
What I love about this is that it doesn’t look forced! It’s not like the coach asked him to do it, but he wanted to do it himself.


And that is why it is so pure 💝💖🌸
Poor kid on the other team gets rejected with the high five :(
I work with the mother of said #50. Will let her know this is up over here. Was originally shared on fb. 
After a day of dealing with the horror of the Christchurch massacre, I really needed that. 
They had to put little Timmy in the "Zero" jersey?
Man that ref really missed a lot of calls there ...
I had a different situation. I was a big guy and scared of people. I ended up meeting this smaller guy named James who everyone loved. He befriended me and brought me into his world. He became my best friend. We used to joke we were Freak the Mighty. He’s still my best friend and he works at the brewer I brew beer for. Listen us big guys need a small friend too. 
#(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
This is great, all around. Even the kid from the opposing team went to high five the kid (was left hanging, oops.) The people who are a part of raising #50 must be super proud. 
I always love seeing the biggest guy on the field showing the most sportsmanship, this kids parents deserve an award
He’s going to grow up to be a good dude 
The world needs more #50s.
#50 for president
#50 is the hero our world needs
Yessss
Such a valuable life lesson for everyone, players and spectators alike!
The world needs more people like #50.
This is the top post of reddit of all time
Damn ninjas cutting onions
lol i awwed at the same time as the lady in the vid, sounded like harmony
I’m not crying, you’re crying 😭 
Seeing him so happy brought tears to my eyes.. 50 so humble!
I'm not crying, you're crying
#50 is a true legend.
We NEED to be like #50
50’s parents should be really proud of their son. 
Thats nice becouse in many cases the bully is the bigger guy.
Awesome kids. Parents and coach/teacher should be proud, too! I hope he keeps up this amazing aspect of his character! 
I’m not crying, you’re crying. 
 #50 is an absolute unit compared to the other team
Those double guns at the end really got me chuckling. That’s awesome
Wow i did not need these emotions at 7:30 AM 
He's so sweet. I hope this cruel world doesn't corrupt that innocence. 
That gave me so much hope in the human race
This dude is a legend and is gonna grow up to be a good man, for sure or maybe he might work ATA care home 
faith in human kindness restored!
Yooooo kids finger guns are on point!!!!
That's the perfect example of gentle giant
Fucking shit, who is pealing onions... Made my day!
/r/mademesmile
Finger guns
This finger pistols at the end :)
Good kids, good coaches, good parents, good people.
Brought tears to me eyes! 
After everything tragic that has happened recently, this has made me feel happy and have faith again. Good on #50’s family for raising him right. Much success to both. 
Lol the double finger guns at his coach. He's a bad ass at heart.
This is so damn wholesome!!! ♥️
So sweet!
This just made my day ..wish more people thought like this child does 😊💖😊
Humans still have hearts
Kids can be so mean. This dude the real MVP.
I wanted 14 to get in there with the big rejection and Dikembe finger wag.
I love how at the end he's like: 😁👉👉
Why is it 5 to 3?
Feeling incredibly proud of #50.....and I’m not even a parent. Good kid. Nay, GREAT kid.
The best kid in the universe #50
IM NOT CRYING YOU ARE 
If #50 sees anyone fucking with that kid, you know he’s gonna bring the pain. 
The world needs more friends like #50.
What a great kid.
Travel.

That's a turnover.

Do your job ref!
r/HumansBeingBros
His parents have raised a good boy. They should be proud. 
I want to set all of my future daughters up with him. 
#10 with the mamba mentality
Hahaha! I love the finger guns at the end!
That kid is awesome!
Nearly teared up at the finger guns 
That is absolutely adorable!
The best part about this is how #50 helps him score and doesn’t make a big deal about it. 

He helps his teammate score and doesn’t look to his teammate to validate HIS help/ego or make it about him- rather, he runs back down the court to help out on defense. #50 does an awesome thing by helping him score and then it’s, “welp, gotta get back on defense!” It’s just normal to him. Great to see! 
Getting my morning onion chopping out early today I see
Awesome 👏🏼 
That made my day!  I love reddit haha
Shout out to #50's parents... Well done
I hope number 50 goes to the league. And during draft night they show this on his featured highlights. 
50 ❤️s
That did my heart good! 
Omg I love that kid!
Does anyone know when this is from or the child's parents? I'd like to buy him a pair of bball shoes.
Lol he's so jazzed!  That's super cute.
Oh the joy!!! #50 is a hero❣️❣️❣️❣️
Warms my heart
I want to be his friend too
You know. I woke up for once feeling good. Had a good morning before work. Had a great conversation with a customer. And then watched this. I'm ready to end today and good to bed on such a good thing. 
That was such a great act of kindness!
Vary rarely are there children that make me like children. So goddamn wholesome.
There was a kid at Starbucks yesterday who looked a lot like #50.  He had a happy meal while his mom got coffee. My wife and I were there with our almost two year old.  He walked up to us with a little purple plush toy and said, “excuse me, I got a girls toy in my happy meal. Would you be okay if I gave it to your daughter?  She’s adorable.”  It was absolutely heart warming. 
I lost it at the finger guns
Even had the finger guns
I'm not crying. This is just sweat coming from my eyes.
# 50 should get a Student of the Year Award
Finger guns. 
Beautiful.  Sometimes I forget that humans can actually be this awesome.  
When you're 11 and have more respect and love than most other people in the world. 50 is going places in the world
#50’s gonna go far in life if he maintains that character. Must have some even more amazing parents. Heart warming to see. 
Why you can upvote just once??it's perfect
What a fucking unit of a child 50 is
#10
Is there any possible way someone could downvote this
I. Am. Sobbing. 
So wholesome

They are so cute I’m gonna die 
Sweetest thing i’ve ever seen! 👉😎👉
Good for him and his parents. Brought a tear to my eye.
😃👉👉
Imagine how proud #50s parents are right now. Raising a good kid for sure 
Well that's fucking adorable.
May God bless him😍❤
That was awesome. Life lessons. 
My man!!
I’m not crying, you’re crying!
*fingerguns*
What a great kid!!
Ooooh I love that he love’s it!
I dont usually get flooded with emotions but this made me cry in a second!!! God bless them.
Love how #50 immediately goes back to ball and playing defense after the play as opposed to looking for recognition of what he did. Genuine kindness. And bonus points for hussle 
The Samwise to a Frodo 
5 billion internet points to #50
Everyone needs to be like #50. 
What a GREAT CHILD!!   Way to go #50 and #50’s parents - YOU ARE DOING IT RIGHT!!!!
Nicely done mom n dad
That kid has heart. I love how he just ran down court like it was a normal point. 50 is the guy who gives all his cash to the homeless and doesn’t make a post stating he has done so.
#10 out for those BUCKETS! That kids anticipation is on 100
The double guns! Brilliant, 
Buy that kid a beer!
I am completely tripping out over this video.  #50 looks and moves EXACTLY like my son did at that age (he’s now 14).  As in, I literally watched the video in disbelief like 10 times, thinking “wtf, was this a game I wasn’t at??”  Exact same build, same hair, same height, same movements.  What’s even more bizarre is his basketball team always wore this exact shade of blue because it’s the color of the local high school, and my son always wore a white t-shirt under his jersey like that.  AND... to top it off... my son actually wore #50 one season.  Feel like I’ve entered the twilight zone...?!  Absolutely bizarre to watch my kid’s doppelgänger appear in my Reddit feed!

Anyway.  Totally adorable video:)
#10 sucks.
test
Wow still the most upvoted reddit post of all time
Most people seem to like these things, but they make me uncomfortable. You're tricking the kid. If he has no chance of playing well without everyone letting him score, then he shouldn't be playing. He should be playing with kids on his level with a hoop he can reach with the ball. He can score legitimately and on his own then. Just my opinion.
Unpopular Opinion: There is a time and a place to be compassionate. The 8 other kids most out on being competitive. Inb4 they are just kids. Being competitive is absolutely essential to being successful in the real world. To reiterate, compassion is very important, but competition should take priority in this setting.
[deleted]
Fuck off this isnt cute
Helps the kid get a bucket then flies back on D, Lebron could learn a thing or two from #50.
Why do I just see pity and not kindness when I watch this stuff :(
[removed]
In ancient Sparta they would’ve discarded him off the cliffs
Thats very nice if him
Good job, buddy! 

Now get off the court and let the humans play.
Lmao he actually so hyped that he rejected the handshake offer from this mere mortal being at the end
Like sure everybody is unique, but not everyone is special. And doing stuff like this can be beneficial to someone whose already insecure but if exposed to this too much come time for the real world there will be lots of times when they feel they're deserving of this kind of praise for wiping their shit all by themselves or something similarly easy/unimpressive to actual society. 
That’s video of the year material right there. 
One day #50 may need a lawyer or accountant or something....and this one will remember this game and be there for him.  Good people are always making investments in karma.
#10 is gonna need a kick in the pants though.
That’s a brotherly thing to do...
Finger guns, forever killin’ it 👈🏼👉🏼
This has made my morning.
Hope he's good at math. 
When you’re so happy the finger guns come out 
parenting done right
This post made my day!
Get back on defense number 0!
r/wholesomememes
Being a referee for kids must the be the most infuriating job there is 
aww finger guns came out
This made me cry, dammit reddit!!
so nice.
wow i havent smiled like this since the smile i smiled a few weeks ago
Those finger guns ☝☝
Those finger guns... OMG
awwwww that's cute
So cool to watch that. Thanks for sharing :)
I'm more of a dog person but this hit my heart like a defibrillator. 

I swear there's more kindness in the world this year.  If it's not true,  please don't tell me.
Oh my heart!!
My heart just melted... That was just so sweet of Him
Right in the feels section. Good on the big fella for big a good kid. 
Kids are the smartest and kindest people. Helping them stay so is up to us.
I just watched the Parks and Rec episode where Andy and Ron coaches kids basketball teams. This could’ve totally been a practice game for the FUNdaMENTALS
What the fuck is #10 doing !?
Look how happy he is 
His mom should be proud!
👉😎👉
What a sweetheart! 💕
The kids ARE alright.
#50!  
Get home from the gym to check Reddit and now im in tears. That was fucking beautiful

&#x200B;
Brings tears to my eyes... so sweet.
This is so pure.
Love this!!!
Faith in humanity enhanced. :)
A real team.
Love how the kid from the other team even goes for a high five, sweet.
Damnit. That’s incredible. 
Best thing I’ve seen all day. 
[Number 14 left hanging](https://imgur.com/a/HfUhS46)
Omg 😍 this is my favorite thing 
I teared up
The king
Finger guns
I love stuff like this. I hope my kids someday are this caring towards others. That would mean I've done my job right.
Oh my heart. 
Wholesome.

Priceless friendship budding there!
I'm not crying you're crying
I’m not crying. You are crying. 
That kid is going to be a great man!
#50 is senator Bernard Sanders 
What a wonderful friend!
Great parents provided #50 with incredible values. Very nice to see that. 
The finger guns at the end! I love this kid! 
Well now I'm crying, thanks!
Haha with finger guns to the fans!
Was not expecting this to make me cry over my morning coffee. 
Happiness begets happiness. We can all learn more from #50.
put a smile on my face :)
It's cool. I'm crying. At 10 in the morning.
Faith in humanity restored yet again
Oof ma heart
Most of the time I lose faith in humanity especially with kids today and seeing videos like this somewhat restores that faith. 
Awesome! 
What a champ!
That is so beautiful 
Love the gun fingers at the end
👉😎👉 Zoop!
So, completely ignorant about sports... How common is it to give a kid #0? Is he like a mascot?
He’s got kid zoomies
Finger points!!!!
Man this really made me smile, so happy for them both :) 
Idk what’s up with me lately, but this 40 second video has me tearing up. So sweet.
#50 truly did not even stick around for credit or a praise. I wonder if that’s his brother 

Why is this so big????
#50 playing with raw emotion out there. Get this kid a scholarship. His friend included. Kids out there dominating the offensive glass. 
50 shades of awesomeness 
#50 is the kind of kid that will end up getting a medal of honour.


#50 has a fantastic future ahead of him. What a guy. 
lmao #10 got that mamba mentality
Number 50 deserves nothing but the absolute best life. What a hero. 
Best part is a kid from the other team #14 even tried to give #0 a high five after he scored 
And every kid needs coach that allows such kindness. 
Those pistol fingers are what’s up. 
faith in humanity fucking restored. Also, crying while taking my morning dump
I used to have a friend like number 50. Tall sumbitch he was in the nicest fucking person ever. I hope you're doing better in the other side buddy.
Sure I do. I don't have one. I'm happy for that kid.

Now where do I stand. Geez.
#10 was so excited he was gonna block that shit on his own team mate
O'Doyle really rules!
Lol usually the big kids are bully’s it’s nice to see a change
my friends tell me "you suck, I don't want to play with you"
Midway through 2nd grade; recess, my first day at a new school.  We had moved from a rural village to an inner city neighborhood and I was scared shitless, trying to stay invisible.
Some older kids spotted me and started to harass me, then another older kid came over and told them to leave me alone.  He must have had a pretty tough rep because they backed right off and never bothered me again. He sat with me until the bell rang, just chatting, then disappeared.  I never found out who he was but now, almost 70 years later, I still remember and am grateful to him for how he stuck up for a kid he didn't even know.
Anyone else notice Ron Swanson ref
Reminds me of Freak the Mighty
such a heartwarming clip 
 #10 has the mamba mentality.
0 needs to get back on defense
#10 got that mamba mentality 
#50 and his parents deserve everything good in life. 
The other team need to work on their defense. There's only one guy down there. Box out and get the rebound.
Why does that kid have to be #0?! 
Get back on D, bro. 
This is why we all came to Reddit, not to see the messed up things (even though we do it occasionally take a peek) but to see the things that make this world a better place!!
High five denied 
Kids helping each other is so nice, reminds me of some of the times in elementary school, lol
His lil finger guns at the end! He's never going to forget that moment 
This thread is dedicated to #10 slander.
He just totally gave up on playing D.
It must suck to actually referee these games
We all need a friend like #50, but we all have friends like #10

#10 what is you doing baby
Somebody raised that kid well and he embodied it better!
WHAT A LITTLE SUPERSTAR, did anyone else see those lil finger guns at the end!!??!?
#10 is not the friend that I want
This is so sweet
Now for the weather. Its raining on my face...
The finger guns at the end are such a power move
Ahhh my hearts gonna explode
Team in white seems to only have three players.  What is going on?
this made me tear up, I never seen such a good kid do such a nice thing for a long time. :')
Everyone needs parents like #50 has.
Big boy with a giant heart. Respect.
Omg. My heart is full and faith in humanity restored. For now. 
Omg the little finger guns 😭
That kid got left hanging but that's ight
Holy adorable christ!
You made me cry in the restaurant😭
Offensive foul to the ref for double finger banging.
Got me at the double guns
tears
The coach is Ron Swanson.
I like how number 14 tried to go for the high five at the end.
Poor kid is number zero, lol.
Travel
Everyone has a friend like #10
Lmao I went into this meme thinking he was gonna tear thru all the little kids but pleasantly surprised 
And then 10 runs in for the rebound lol. 
Don't piss off the big guy
 https://youtu.be/uqUZBpnCJ7c
I just gotta say. #10 seems like a shit head
Little did everybody know 0 grew up to be Lebron James 
Congrats on #1 post all time
Look at #10 being a lil asshole trying to take the point from him
47 days old and still makes me happy every time I see this.
The best post on reddit.
THE MOST UPVOTES POST ON REDDIT IS 69 DAYS OLD
IM SO PROUD OF THIS COMMUNITY
Love this, the happiness 50 has just created...what a guy
I'm glad this is the most upvoted post on Reddit

omg that is the cutest thing. I bet the parents balled their eyes out.

&#x200B;

edit: really? I'm getting downvoted? is crying with joy not appropriate here? and did no one get the pun? reddit is so weird sometimes...
This isnt healthy for that kid because its not reflective of reality...and its a complete diservice to every other kid there. This would be awesome in friendly game of hoop on the playground...in a competitive game tho? Its irresponsible coddling.
Faith in humanity restored 
Oh my goodness! This is so sweet!
That kid has more empathy than our president.  
Haha he thinks he made it
But #10 is the player you want 
there's a little seamonkey on the court and nobody calls a time out?  the ref is blind!
[deleted]
Man that white team is doing terrible, it wouldn't matter if they were even there 
If I was the ref I would have swatted the fuck out of that ball. Have to assert your dominance, especially in the paint.
Poor kid...everyone is lying to him. Does nobody see what wrong with this??!


Ah, training for the Special Olympics has started! 
Oh man, as soon as I saw 50 look at the kid I thought he was gonna pick on him. I'm super glad I was wrong. I've become cynical.
What a good big boi. 
If only the NBA was that nice
r/HumansBeingBros
/r/tippytaps at the end! It was adorable!
I hope to one day be 1/5th as happy in my life, as that kid was when the basket went in. 
I cried, not because of this amazing display of humanity, but the missed hi-five. 
CURRY!!
Looks like they are forming some sort of a mega-person
Damn, they had to give little man number 0 huh?
That's awesome and very sweet. Am I wrong to be amused that the kids number is 0?

r/sportsarefun 
Ron Swanson missed more traveling than an NBA ref 
Where is the defense on this play.  Are they in garbage time?
I lil homeboy still celebrating to this moment. 🤙
I mean nice and all play some defense LeBron.
Get the fuck back on defense!
I hate how #10 just tries to score selfishly. Kids can be amazing but also ignorant af.
Awesome, but why the F does he have number 0 on his jersey? ;/
Who run Barter Town?
It’s Saturday morning, and I’m working my mandatory manager Saturday open and close shift at my office.   Kinda pissed, not really motivated to work on the pile of paperwork on my desk.   
I just watched this video.   

I’m ok to work now.   
Get back on D!
Travel!
IRL most ppl are #0 who thought they're #50
Kids worse than James Harden on defense 
My eyes are sweating.
Towards the end I was I thinking the only thing that would make it any better would be double finger guns, and then bam! 
What a champ
Such an awesome video. Why he gotta do #14 like that though? Lol jk
This is so genuinely heartwarming! Thank you!
Hod-ball.
Ok LeBron, now get back on D
My heart grew three sizes
Those finger guns.. 👉👉
Videos like this make me think that the world is still slowly becoming a better place, despite the negative headlines. I don’t remember things like this happening when I was a kid, or at least as often as they seem to happen now.
This video keeps making my eyes leak copious amounts of water. 😭
That just made that Lil kids day!!  We need more younger people like that 
r/mademesmile

The finger guns got me
The finger guns at the end omg
to whoever raising this kid, you are doing an amazing job. we need more parents like you. 
I would be so proud if my child did this, that’s some good stuff right there. 
Even nr 14 on the other team wanted to highfive him. Very wholesome
Fuck number 10
Those finger guns got me!
The finger guns at the end
Get that kid on Ellen immediately. 
Dem finger guns at the end. So stoked for this kid!
That kid has more leadership qualities than 90% of people in manager roles. 
Well I wasn't planning on weeping openly on a Saturday morning but here I am. Doing that. This is so awesome.
Noice
The ref looks like Ron Swanson
Made my entire day!
Welp. Now I’m crying in public. 
Man that’s awesome. I bet little insignificant things like that stick in that little guy’s mind forever. I bet it’s a HUGE positive impact on little dude
Heartwarming. What a great kid. Bet he has great parents too. 🙂
Omg #0 happy dance when they got the ball in the hoop made me so happy!
This video hit me in the feels so hard my eyes started watering.
\#50 is the real MVP
Strange, who cuts onions this early in the morning??
Was this at Mae Hensley Jr. High?
Shoutout to all those kids giving him a chance and clapping off the basket. 
#10 is mamba mentality
Then that little kid trained to become the biggest basketball player today, Stephen Curry. 
Dude, *all* these kids are awesome.

Especially 14 who totally got left hanging.
We need more people like him in this world especially in this dark times . Respect !
Future NBA star
That's awesome - Great kid, obviously with great parents. Well done.
If everyone was like 50 and had a friend like 0 the world would be a better place
How about an F in the chat for number 14 that got left hanging 
Amazing kid.  Must be great work by his parents! I’d be so proud!!!
I'm not crying, you're... naw; I'm crying.
;( makes me happy i cry
He left that other kid hanging though lmao
What a great kid. I hope I can raise my daughter to be like this kid someday. 
Why can't everyone be like this?
Ok. Ok. I ain't giving up on you humanity. But this is the last time. One more slip up and you know it! 
That looked like an nba all star defense
Am I the only one who is pissed that the kid's number is 0?!
Get back on the D!

Was that Ron Swanson?
I hope he hangs on to those wonderful traits for life. 
I didn’t cry....you cried!!
"High five!"

"Not in the face!"
Yup, whatever their parents did with that kid, they did it right. 
That's Brock Lesnar and Eddie Bravo
Traveling just isn’t a thing anymore.  
Damn 0 left 14 hanging 
This kid is awesome, his parents should be very proud of him.
His celebration at the end 😂
I love that the little dude fucks off and gives everyone the finger guns lol
Number 10 got that Mamba Mentality. Get buckets no matter the cost
Everyone needs a friend like #0
Aww how he was doing the finger guns at the end! 

👉🏻😎👉🏻
Made me shed two tears
Bros. 
Zero to hero! Just like that!
I love him! I hope my children grow up to be that kind and loving!
Tree fiddy 
Wow. The best thing I have seen today!
Little Hodor
Floor full of good humans there. 
The finger guns got me
Too wholesome 
Red carpet D over here, Jesus Christ guys! Let’s see some hustle!
Ok but where is the defense otherwise? 
Trash D /s
Let’s be #50 for someone Everyday 💪🏻
👉🏼😬👉🏼
I want to hug him AND his parents. They are doing such a great job. 
Be that friend.. When you get a chance.. ❤️❤️#50
That kid needs to huddle and get back on defense!! They are gonna fast break!
I love the finger guns at the end
Fighting back tears here. So awesome. 
If this doesn't bring a tear to your eye I don't want to know you
No. 10 with that Mamba Mentality
Left #14 in white hanging lol
#50 is a rarity in this world, worth more than any diamond. 
This is absolutely beautiful 
600
Someone didn’t give number ten the message
Awww.. sweetest gesture! #50 proved that "A friend in need is a friend indeed!"
That's one good kid, I like him
Guess what? I got a fever! And the only prescription is more finger guns!
There's a shit storm going on in my life and I genuinely smiled because of this. God bless that #50 if there ever was a god
Let's get this on LWIAY
Finger guns engaged!
Hit em with the finger guns
I bet his parents won't have to bribe school officials to get him into college. 

Good job parents and #50. 
The finger guns are what get me every time, I love to see this
Hell, I'd rather watch them then most NBA games. I must be getting old.
Bonus: ref that looks like Ron Swanson
\#50 for president
This is humanity.
#10 got some great defensive awareness. Heard he got 47 rebounds that night. 
Expelled for finger guns. 
When those little finger guns came out at the end...beautiful.
Stop showboating and play some fucking defense!
Finger gun celbration, this guy is a winner
Gotta respect the other team for standing to the side as well, everyone here is pretty good.
This is so nice. We need more of this and less bad
Fingerguns!
Stop showboating and play some defense idiot
That's really sweet, what they did.
❤️😭
Opposing team was excellent as well :) such great spirit from these kids at such a young age :))) 
Awesome
Young Hodor
That kid is a great kid 
If everyone acted like this the world would be so much better
Now that is a good kid!
Plug walk
He looks so happy after! Definitely brightened up my day with this one OP 😄
Reminds me of Freak the Mighty
Shoutout to #50’s parents for not raising an asshole
Finger guns!
He left that boy hanging lmao
Haha

  .... That act gives me hope for the human race ..
 #14 tries to give him a high five afterwards and is left hanging, absolutely brutal
#50 deserves so much praise, but everyone on the court needs to be in on it for that to happen. It just takes one asshole kid from the other team to come by and steal the ball. I noticed even the young man from the other team cheered when he made it. Kids man, we should try to be more like them. 
My heart! I needed that today:)
This is heartwarming 
Made my day!
The parents of #50 are doing a great job
He got real friend
We got a real life Hodor here. 
#50 is the real mvp 
finger guns at the end killed me 👉👉. that clip was all around awesome 
#raisedright
Epic
Good kid
This is beautiful!!
I no-one talking about the denied high-five of #14 though? 
I'm saying...I admire how kind this child is. His jersey is # 50. That's all!!!!!
AGGGGHHHHH THIS IS TOOO CUTEEEE
NBA2K: BAD TRANSITION DEFENCE
What a great kid. Gives me hope for the future, this simple video and the kind gesture it shows between children.
Gave em the ol' finger guns, what a champ!
My heart 😭
I really think there needs to be the opposite of doxxing where the internet finds this kid and we all bombard him, his parents, his school, his city, with words of how proud we are having seen this. Then we set up a go fund me page and all donate this kid a dollar. 
probably didnt even count that towards the overall scores
No better celebration than finger guns 👉👉
Little dude should know better than to leave an high five hanging...savage
Little ADHD #10 needs to settle down
Love the video. Just wish the kid being helped didn’t have the number 0
From 0 to Hero.
no one noticed Ron Swanson is officiating?
That is... Just Aww. 
My face seems to have sprung a leak.
Shoutout to the kid in white going for the hi-five, we see you!!!
My eyes are leaking, what's wrong with them?
What a sweet boy!  
This made my heart happy :')
When you see a kid do something like this, you know he’s being raised well. 
My heart is in pieces.
Those finger guns are priceless. 
Everyone needs a friend like #50. 

Everyone has a friend like #10
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Attaboy, #50! You the man, lil homie! 
The world needs kinder people. The people who are mean and purposely misconstrue things only emphasize my point.
That kid will do more great things in his life. Kudos to him!! 

Ps-stupid onion cutting ninjas. 
I’m crying! 
Indeed!
This just made my day.  Was having a pretty shitty one up until now.  Thanks Reddit your a real bro 
Why, as an adult, doi tear up at all this kind of wholesome goodness. 
14 is the real victim of this video.
hodor
That’s actually so adorable 
Damn it! Now my eyes are leaking!
Finger guns all the way. This kid rocks ha
What the world needs now is #50 sweet# 50
His parents did a good job raising him. Props to the opposing team also. Dang, now to wipe the tear from my eye. 
Awwwww
Damn people can be so good when they wanna 
Nice
Who put these onions under my eyes?
Good boy!
Yeah that's okay. I needed to get my daily cry in anyway 😭😭😭
Number 10 seems like the type of kid who’s parents scream at the coach for not giving him playing time even though he sucks
President 50.
If I was either of those kids' parents I'd be bawling with pride.
Ppl im at the pub right now,tell me that im #50
Made me a lil sad that the kiddo has a cero on his shirt :(
We all need a friend like 0.
This relationship is Hodoresque 
Damn, this reminded me of The Benchwarmers for some reason! 
Lmao the finger guns at the end
Creative finish for sure. He needs to work on his transition defense though 
Number 0 still left the white guy hanging
