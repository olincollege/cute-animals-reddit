You can see where he gets his smile
Is... is THE ROCK blushing?! 🥰
Everyone loves embarrassing and adorable mom zoom drop-in
The way The Rock looks at his mother is beautiful!
The rock looks different here, not sure why though

Edit:  wow wasn't expecting this much response. I feel I should respond to the messages but I can't be bothered. It leaves me I a strange situation. I guess you could call it being between a and a hard place...
Its so weird to think that celebrities have parents too and up to this point I've never thought who Dwayne's parents were
she looks so young and strong at her age.
They both must go to the same dentist. I want to go to the dentist with the Johnson’s.
Everybody gangsta ´till the mama starts singing
Reminds me of all the backlash on him being in Moana instead of a “native Hawaiian” because people are too fucking stupid to look up his heritage.
That was one of the most genuine moments that tv will ever have. Can we get more Mama Johnson pls?

Edit: To those saying it was planned. Of course it was. I was referring to them all showing genuine joy at the whole thing. It was a planned feel good family moment that actually made me feel good. Though I would love to belive The Rock's mom just saw an opportunity to be a goof and embarass her son.
His face looks thin
Man lets just hope The Rock is not one of those celebrities where you think all the best of them only to find out they are complete assholes later.

&#x200B;

Dude comes across as a genuinely good guy.
Jimmy Fallon has got one of the fakest smiles and laugh in Hollywood. You can tell he puts it on lmao
TIL the rocks mom is the grandmother from Moana
The Rock is such a genuine and nice guy. It’s pretty sad because he used to go through some rough times. His parents struggled to pay for an apartment and he and his mom were depressed. When his family got evicted one time his mom attempted suicide and he saved her. He also went on to college where he pursued football but much to his disappointment left because of injuries. Now he’s a super humble guy
It’s so cool to hear the Samoan language on the front page of Reddit and even on Jimmy Fallon, Manu Samoa!!!
“We got one more!”
HAHAHAHAHA🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣👏👏👏👏HAHAHHAHAAHAA👏👏👏🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂👏👏👏HAHAHAAAHHHAHAHAHHHAAAHA😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂😂🤣🤣👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Big Tough boys melt when mother is around ...
I thought the Rock was the coolest until mom showed up, he only got 1/2 her cool!!! 😎
Look how happy she is, you can't be mad at that smile!
How “spontaneous”
It's nice to know a-list celebrities can still be embarrassed by their parents.
I can't stand Jimmy Fallon
Mom’s gonna mom.
I hate Jimmy Fallon.
It was so beautiful until Jimmy did his fake ass laugh.
Jimmy fallon is fuckin weird
This is why the rock is my celebrity crush. I’m a straight man btw
I wonder how her cooking is.
if you think this isn't staged then I can't help you
Completely wasn’t staged or planned in advance
ITT people expressing love for genuine moments with celebrities while watching a planned skit and the most disingenuous guy on TV react.
When I lived in Utah, the Samoan community there taught me this song and it still brings back some of my best memories.
This dude is so nice! He came out about an hour after load out started for a wwe show. He was going from person to person thanking us for our time and hard work. Stagehands, security, ushers, everyone. He didn’t care who you were he wanted to thank you.
He looks like he has cancer .. not sure why .. I love him so don’t mean to be a jerk
As awesome as it is, it's weird that people still think anything is even remotely spontaneous in those shows
That's adorable. The people's mom.
I’ve never seen The Rock blush before. I guess even adult super stars get embarrassed by their moms.
Embarrass your famous child on national television in a delightful way?  That's top tier momming.
Omg that's such a mom thing! 😂❤️
The rock: see you later mom I’m going to set.

Mom: hold on, I packed you a lunch

The rock: I’m a grown man mom!

Mom: I cut the crust off your PBJ

The rock: ...thanks mom, I love you!
Jimmy Fellon Said:🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣👏👏👏👏👏🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
100% planned
Jimmy Fallon is intolerable.
She’s so adorable! Now I know where he gets that great smile from.
Ok Rock has always been super down to earth and adorable but mom just seriously upped the game. Go Rock mom!
I am smiling that is wholesome.
I love how he’s getting so flushed. Like he’s so embarrassed but he loves his mom so he just goes with it lol.
Moms can sometimes be annoying. But never forget that moms are alway there to help you when you need that help, or they teach you all the stuff you need to know and they are alway there for you.
Cute video! But just wanted people to know that since it’s Jimmy Fallon, this was planned beforehand. That show is so homogenized and put through a filter that even the interviews are basically scripted.
Jimmy Fallon is the fakest human being on planet earth or he has alcohol injections during every show cause for the life of me I can’t understand how he is always so absurdly animated laughing at literally anything.
Fallon sucksssss
Could you imagine being one of the only people on earth who can tell the rock "shut the fuck up we are doing this" ?  That's female power at its finest right there haha.
I grew up listening to this song and it makes me miss my gramps
Looks like he didnt get this weeks batch of synthesized baby blood
She's like "I squeezed your big muscley head out of my nethers, let me be on tv"
No matter how big you get or how successful you are.. you will forever be your momma's boy...
This is definitely not staged promotion on Jimmy Fallon's NBC show for the Rock's new NBC show about growing up that features stories about his mother and family called Young Rock.

100% just a completely candid moment. Nothing to see here.

^/s
Now we know who was responsible for helping him be such a great human being.
My boyfriends called Jimmy and I have a uke. I'm going to copy her finger placement and learn this for valentines day.
I love that the comments on here have turned into people talking about culture. I especially enjoy reading everyone’s personal experiences. TIL Samoan culture is magnificent. This is one of the most wholesome comment sections I’ve seen. 

ETA: I would like to love to more about Samoan culture. Can anyone recommend a place to travel (post-pandemic) to experience it?
if it has jimmy fallon then get it the fuck out of my sight
Not staged at all, these aren't actors who've learned how to market themselves for 100's of millions of dollars /s
Everything The Rock does is staged, managed and fake as hell. Which should make you uncomfortable. What’s his end goal? Aside from what he said already, he wants to be president. 

He tries too hard to look clean which makes me feel uneasy.
This would have been better without Jimmy... So annoying
Yeah that wasn't planned and rehearsed at all..
Of course Jimmy Fallon eats this up
awwwww cutes family moment
u/savevideo
I love them both
The difference between The Rock's real smile and Jimmy's fake smile is night and day.
Can you smell what the mom is cookin?
The rock being embarrassed by his mom on national television is my favorite moment of covid easily.
What a lovely family
Lol
This is how tv interviews should be from now on.  It's so much more real than someone sitting in a studio audience.  I love all the little surprises that we get from a remote interview.
So wholesome. I wish I had a mom.....
Jimmy interrupts every second he can lol
Man it must feel so dystopian being in studio with jimmy laughing and no audience 

He used to be so good.
I defended him for awhile, but this fake laugh era needs to end.
Its so disingenuous.

Please stop.
Weird to see a rock turn red lol 

Very wholesome.
Who's a bigger supper star than the rock? Mother Rock that's who!
How can I get a print?
Anyone wondering how old his mom is to still have basically a full head of colored hair?  Like damn i wish my mom would look that good when I'm 50.
when the rock turns into a pebble.
Fuck jimmy is so annoying. Such a great moment between the rock and his mom and jimmy just points and cackles. Uhg
u/savevideo
He maybe the rock, but around his mom he's just a pebble :')
Now i know why The Rock is a Superstar 😭
Dwayne looks like a school boy that just got embarrassed by his mom. Gotta love moms..
I love that you can see is admiration of her but he's also blushing, haha
That’s amazing!! I love it- I miss my mom❤️
Was waiting for her to break into the Eddie Van Halen solo.

What a gyp.
He has that look that I've used more than one occasion: "Oh god mum"....
urf.....Fallon. Biggups Rock Momster
I’m just saying, whenever The Rock needs a cat stuck up a tree, a guy at the side of the road needing assistance changing a tyre, or a mother on hand to sing impromptu duets, he always manages to find a way to come across them and be in a position to share them with the world. 

He’s going to grow up to be Albert Einstein, I’m sure of it.
This is by far the most adorable thing I have seen in awhile.
I hate Jimmy Fallon and his fake ass laugh
I think the rock is finally starting to look older
This is the first time I saw him "age". He looks older than usual
It was planned. How do you know this? Because you can clearly hear his mom which means she is wearing a microphone
Is The Rock ok? He doesn’t look well
Just love the fact when his mum said "One more" and his look of "Oh no.. mum's embaressing me"  and just headesks laughing!,  damn near laughed so hard!
Hammyness runs in the family.
"crashes"
All I see is a nice lady singing
This is ridiculously adorable 😂😂
More reason to love Dwayne Johnson <3
Jimmy looks more and more like a used car salesman every week
The Rock looks old and Im not okay with that :(
Leah Maivia is a hell of a woman
Believe it or not the Rock is standing up in this video and his mom is just super tall.
Everytime I see Fallon: 🤮
Why's he look so small here 🤣🤣
Jesus christ Jimmy looks plastered
Ahahahaha!
Can you smell what the Rock’s mom is cooking???
Good old fashion love man
Man I am lovong this!
Clearly staged
"Keep your cool, your nice guy image is one the line, keep your cool, look happy, smile"
That shirt tho
Now **that** is why the Rock is one of the most popular stars out there. WYSIWYG.
A lot of people shit on Fallon, but celebrities genuinely seem to like him. He gets a lot of good moments like this.
What happened to him, aids?

He looks terrible. Shell of himself.
His Mom is notoriously awesome, she was often at ringside not just for The Rock’s matches but all of his extended family who are also wrestlers to support them.
First time I've ever seen him embarrassed
My name is Jimmy, so in my mind the Rock and his adorable mom were singing to me.
What a MOM. What a queen. What a breath of fresh air!
How anyone can watch Jimmy Fallon is beyond me
I needed this wholesomeness and love today. The Rock’s mom rocks!
this is the oldest I've ever seen the Rock look
It’s the people’s song!
God I knew exactly how Fallon was going to react and I hate it
I love his mom! I can see where he gets his great nature!
Now we know where his presence, timing, and talent comes from.

And also how a blush looks like on a tanned person.
1000000% planned but still cute
Wow! He’s looking like Ben Kingsley now.
I don't really love Jimmy. I don't mean to be a hater, he's ok, but him blowing kisses "I'm sending love right back to you!". Everything that should feel real just feels like he's faking reactions for the camera. Especially when he holds his hand over his mouth to engage the shocked reaction. It all just feels so detached for a real human connection. I honestly don't think he should be a 24/7 on-camera guy. He seems a little too self-conscious and disconnected in his own head for that.
Fallon is not funny.  The rock should take his spot.
Meanwhile Jimmy’s laugh is as fake as it has ever been.  What a clown!!
His momma is his beautiful Rock 💪🏼😍
Fallon is an enormous toolbag but holy crap, this was so damn wholesome. Can see where The Rock gets his sense of humor.
Dude I saw that yesterday and it was so wholesome
Man may have the world in his palm but his mama will always be his sun.
The Rock's Mom said, "Know your role!"
I fucking hate jimmy fallon and his fake over the top laughter. It’s beyond annoying at this point. Rocks mom seems like a nice person though.
Staged
This was obviously planned.
Definitely not pre-planned because these shows are not pre-recorded
Good fake scene haha very funny... lol shame
[deleted]
Looks pretty planned to me.
Beautiful moment
It doesn't matter how old you are, your island mum can always embarrass you hehe
Jimmy Fallon has the personality of a golden retriever
There is no greater tribute than to have Duane “The Rock” Johnson and his mother serenade you.
I had dinner with her and his cousin one, she's awesome.
Awww
He's startin' to look a little older. Had to happen eventually.
So is Jimmy Fallon really just a very awkward, lovable dork - or is he secretly an evil bastard that seems awkward because it's all a low-effort act?
This seems calculated and staged. 

Cute all the same though
To anyone unaware. The Rocks family is massive in the prowrestling world. This woman has been around some of the most charismatic people on the planet for a very long time and a lot of the younger kids have found success. 

Her father was winning titles all over the place in the 70s and she has people in her family 2 generations younger than her still tearing up.
His kids have the coolest grandma!
I don’t get why people hate more on Fallon over Kimmel though, the latter would have tried to just make himself look more charismatic and smile 10x more than necessary and try to make it more about him and his reaction whereas I feel Fallon is more authentic
Then why is he such a FUCKIN PRICK on set , you're not seeing the real rock on screen and television, well maybe on "Punked" years ago till he noticed the camera .
The risks of working from home.  :)
They need a reality show together
Big wholesome content love it
u/savevideo
She is so stinking cute.
This is her big break she wasn't gonna let it slip away
Makes me wanna call my mom
May be the only time Jimmy truly laughed.
So cute!
Hes cringing so hard hahaha
is it me or does he look skinnier?
It's so cute how he's all embarrassed. Love this.
The Rock blushing!
Total mom move!
She should be cast in every Rock movie as his mom. I would go out of my way to “Stan Lee” her into his movies. Or like Martin Scorsese’s mom in Goodfellas.
The left side of his head almost looks sunken in? Possibly had eye lift surgery or some work done? Either way we all wear with age, looking rock solid D-Johnson💪
She kinda looks like the grandma from Moana
The Rock lives with his mom... we're all good dudes.
Everybody answers to somebody.
“It’s ADORABLE!”
If you still have your mother with you, call her or hug her if. Cherish every moment you can with her ❤️
Oh my gosh, she is such a cutie!!!
Shooooo cute 🥰
Is there a version of this without Fallon?
I see where the Rock gets it. Both of his parents seem to be (and were) super confident and great people.
This is incredible.
Has to be the most loved guy in the world.  He is the most followed onlune
Imagine trying to break into the Rock’s mom’s house while he’s visiting...
That was adorable 💜
Never too famous to be embarrassed by your mom. This is great
So THAT'S where he gets his smile from :)
That’s so sweet
hola edito videos el que este interesado mande md al privado
>the rocks mom crashes

I was real worried for a minute
This is exactly what I needed early in the morning. 😁😁
Lmao
Rock’s ever so brief attempt to corral his mom before he just caves and goes along with it. Lol
“You’re welcome!”
the ROCK's mom is on point
The Rock seems like a really genuine dude, love to have a beer or a cheat meal with him!
rock is looking older without all that makeup
Last week I was looking to buy a ukelele now I need to.
so awesome! Samoans are very sweet people!
So back during some of his later post-movie heel runs he'd do that "Rock Concert" bit.

Since she made The Rock does this mean it's a Volcano Concert?

Cuz I'm okay with this.

Volcano Mama!
Best video ever! If I couldn't love the Rock even more....
The Rock’s mom might be cuter than his kid! 🥺
I need this beachside
u/savevideo
Can you imagine the pride she must have to have a son like him?
Reminds me of the two vacations I went with my parents to Hawaii and every Hawaiian had a smile on their face all the time.
Can she be my grandma?
“Crashes interview”
Only person to get away with this on the planet except maybe his daughter.
She’s adorable
u/vredditshare
Can we just elect him as POTUS now and get it over with?
The pebble?
Such an amazing mom
Aw love her
I honestly would have no problem if he runs for POTUS in '24.
Cutest thing on internet today
Awe.. Lol haha
I really needed this today, thank you for sharing.
It's so beautiful that a mom can still embaress their child and make them proud all in one moment at any age!
totally spontaneous
It's so cute! To see the stars with their mothers is very nice!
Awe they have the same smile too I just noticed LOL!! haha
Aaaah!! The ghost of late night TV! Hide!
Cultures that stick with their families in adulthood are superior.
The rock looks different.. thinner? Maker sickish. Idk something is very different
"Crashed" lmao more like scripted with this momo Fallon
The he was about to say are you f-ing kidding me then pulled it back at the last second
Is The Rock dying?
Jimmy: OOOOHHH MYYYY
Reminds me of the anchorman scene with the jazz flute.
This is amazing
now we see where he gets his authenticity and wholesomeness
ITT: people who somehow have never seen a mother before, and are new to parent/child relationships, therefore being blown away because the rock and his mom are two nice people who get along. And if this was unscripted and unrehearsed, I have a bridge I’d like to sell you gullible morons.
‘Crashes’
Moana’s grandmother is The Rocks mom
Is it me or does The Rock look really unwell here? He even looks like he's lost weight. Hope he's OK.
Rock and is mum are awesome but man Jimmy Fallon is creepy as fuck to me. I don't know why but man. Terrifying.
This warms my heart
Where can i get that shirt he is wearing?
“crashes” lol
Amazing
Rocks looking old. What is he, 60?
why will he do these terrible late night interviews but not go on hot ones ?!?
ITT, cynical redditors think a dude can't have a wholesome moment with his mom just because it wasn't spontaneous
This is so cute!
their smiles give me life
Yeah, she rocks!
Great mom, you can see why the rocks such a good dude.
He was so embarrassed like every kid, he threw his shoulder and looked at her with glee and odd.
They need to put out a kids album with her favorite songs.  It would sell like hot cakes
Incredibly Wholesome
Not staged at all
She is so damn cute
Is she that close to the camera or is she almost as big as he is?
Love
i wish i can upvote this more!
Wow, I miss my mom.
Ata is such a sweetheart. Just nothing but smiles and love.
all mom's love jimmy. it is known.
Cute !!!
A Mom will never change no matter who you are and how old you are. That's the best about them
Yes, she "crashed it" with this totally spontaneous song and the lyrics just so happen to be pulled up and ready to go off screen so The Rock could read them.
Damn... the rocks mom ages gracefully. She almost looks like she could be his wife or sister.
This made my day 😍
I taught his wive's cousin how to ride a motorcycle and she had nothing but amazing things to say about him. I also met his wife and she's as down to Earth as she is beautiful. He deserves everything he has.
He gets his smile here! :')
100% scripted but damn its nice
Here ist the full version: [https://youtu.be/qc2W-l6aZoo?t=327](https://youtu.be/qc2W-l6aZoo?t=327)
u/SaveVideo
That is an awesome shirt the Rock is wearing. I want one!
Ugh that jimmy fallon was involved but still nice.
How can you not love the fuck out of him, man? He's amazing.
The way The Rock looks at his mum, you get the idea that even though he's this huge megastar and built like a tank, if he pissed her off, she'd beat the living shit out of him
The guy is huge, but still, momma comes crashing, and he's back to the lil guy he was, a bit awkward. It's kinda cute.
This is totally real and not elicited in anyway
Like my daughter said..."Total Mom move"!!!!!!
That is how the true smile of Real ROCK looks when his mom is near him
I love how much he loves his mom ♥️♥️
What a smile
This is going to be legendary but already deserves an award 🥇
She is adorable and you can really see where he gets a lot of his personality in this small clip.
Thank you.
She looks good for her age
Like the Rock. Hate Jimmy Fallon.
She's like 'It doesn't matter if you're in the middle of an interview'
Thats wasnt planned
I wish it wasn't on Fallon's show though. He doesn't deserve this wholesomeness
Why does this host laugh at the most unnecessary times with the most unnecessary tone??
What an awesome moment.
HIS MOM LOOKS SO GOOD!
Staged
Rock's Mom, will you please be my Mom?
Dwayne is just. Pure bean.
Hiw does his mim looks so young?! I would have believed it if someone said it was his elder sister! wth!
You guys actually dont think that this was a bit...?
Does anybody on earth not love this guy? He’s humaning right.
Rock's wearing eye shadow.
So all Polynesian and Melanesian grandparents can play ukulele.

I knew it.
She needs to go on tour!!!! this is the greatest thing ever!!!!!!
His mom is so adorable!
When did the Rock get old?
You can see where he gets his muscle
You can see where he gets his talent lol
He's too much of a man to be embarrassed about it too. Dude's a legend.
That first song brings back a flood of memories. When my son was in 3rd grade he had a Samoan-Maori teacher who taught his class that song. He used to sing it to me driving home from school.
Yoou can see where he gets the wrestling skills XD
Jimmy low-key looking kinda cute
This is fantastic. I love this woman.
r/wholesomememes
This is so nice to see
When your mom married a professional wrestler, you know she doesn't care about keeping up appearances.
Love this...Ata (I think) helped out/run her mother's wrestling promotion?  Some of the stories were that you didn't mess with either of these women, they could whip your ass.
Good god, that's sweet!
That's cute AF!
This is just wholewome.
Anyone know the name of the song?
She must be in her late 60s or early 70s. She looked way energetic and young for her age.
It’s cute. But it was scripted, obviously lol.
It doesn't matter how old you are, or successful you are, or big/strong you are. 

Your mom is always gonna have the right to embarrass you in front of your friends.
Look at Jimmy Fallon's face at the beginning, his mind is blown LOL
Island culture. Beautiful.
I love Jimmy Fallon’s laugh lol
Thank you momma for giving us The Rock!
Owww
that is what i needed on my timeline
Full clip: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qc2W-l6aZoo 

His mum comes in around 6 minutes.
he has his mom's mr.clean head
u/savevideo
The cutest
"Crashes" he says. On Jimmy Fallon of all places. Lol.
I thought the big fat samoan lady in Hobbs and shaw was his real mom lol
\*Feels\*
This would be so much better without Jimmy Fallon's annoying laugh
I wonder why the rock gets his amazing personality. so much early hardship and a mum that loves you and never stops being your mum no matter how famous
He’s off the tren
That man is so damn lovable...
Damn is Jimmy alright? He’s looking a bit...odd, to say the least.
I saw that. She's so cute. Rock was embarrassed b/c he had to sing. so funny.
Is the Rock's mom called "Gaia" or "Mother Earth"?
Rock looking old, sad times
This is the best!!! 😂😂😂❤️❤️❤️
u/savevideobot
Ugh..I’ve no idea how I came to despise Fallon so much, but I just can’t help myself..
Jimmy Fallon with the fake laugh as always
I'm starting to think they love Jimmy
How can such a massive man be so cute with his mother. Can't say 'no' to her haha.
so this must be Mrs. Boulder/jk
This is awesome, love the rock but this was no crash. She was ready to go and so was he
So wholesome
Id happily lose my v card to this man 🥵
[deleted]
I needed this today. Thanks for posting!
"crashes" Obviously staged shit but nontheless adorable.Good folk.
"crashed"

Shit is more scripted than bangbros
Momma Rock.
...absolutely adorable
Wholesome level: Rock tier
u/savevideo
I wish mom was here
The rockette
He is starting to look old. Next stop is Arnie.
National treasure and his mom.
Bad boundaries are not adorable.
Conan has spoiled me... Jimmy's laugh is so fake
I’m so used to seeing pets in this subreddit so this is truly a wholesome treat
He in nz now then... Just round the corner from my mates place 🤣
Jimmy Fallon is the fakest piece of shit ever
Mom is beautiful
Love Dwayne but it's Jimmy fallon's show. There's no such thing as crashed. Everything is super scripted, to the point that it becomes obvious.
I can’t stand Fallon, fake guy through and through
 He’s like “mom I’m doing f***ing Fallon chill” lol moms always embarrass man 😂😂
All these comments are so wholesome. Helped me with a crappy day.
Man Dwayne is gonna be passed when his mom wins the 2032 election instead of him.
Totally real and totally cool
Is it just me, or does he look more like Jean-Claude Van Damme now?
If we could get rid of Jimmy Fallon, this would be a perfect clip.
Cute
She must have a heart of gold if she says she loves Jimmy.
His whole head blushes.
This is so adorable my brovaries exploded
Doesn’t matter how old or famous you are- your mom still reserves the right to embarrass you in public 😂😂
Love The Rock
Can't wait to see his new television series
this was adorable!
The Rocks whole family has been involved in show business for generations. We shouldn’t be surprised.
*claps* fantastic!
He looks just like his momma! So sweet
The Rock was blushing, lol!
It’s so strange when The Rock looks at his mom he looks so much more kid like it’s really wholesome
That is so cute. I wish I had a mom like that.
Awww that's awesome!
God I hate jimmy kimmel lol 

But god I love the rock
So wholesome. Ya love to see it.
She looks like she could kick the shit out of him.
Nice lady.
and the fake excitement from jimmy destrys it
R/mademesmile
So fucking cute! You can tell no matter what he's doing he will sing that song with her.
The rock is great on a guitar too! https://youtu.be/sjtAgrsnY5g?t=105
Damn the rock looks old here
Wonder what she is cooking?
hhhhhh OMG
All the Tongans recovering from that other Samoan jam with 'lemu' and here comes the Rock's moms with it again lol.
From what I heard him say about women in his family we wouldnt want to see that lady angry.
This is really cute, it made me want to cry, made me jealous, and want to die all at the same time, neat.
Tala lives
Samoan women are tough, she's pretty typical in energy for an average samoan lady. It's why samoan men have short life expectancy lol
Any idea what all those things are lined up on the shelf behind him?
Jimmy looks a little tipsy
Even the Rock gets embarassed by his mom sometimes. Too funny
"Moooooom you're embarrassing me in front of Jimmy Fallon!"
The only bad part about this video is that guy Jimmy.
Between him & John Cena I feel like I shoulda been a professional wrestler.  They’re are just always ON.
And this is one of many reasons why the rock is awesome.
You can’t say no to mama on national television... well played mama!
Awwwww ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Two very decent people, interviewed by a schmuck.
/r/thathappened
I firmly believe Jimmy Fallon to be the least likeable human to have ever been born
This so so adorable and lowkey Therapeutic
This is what the Rock would look like if we had no steroids in the world left
Adorable! I love the fact that just for a second you see Dwayne Johnson as a little guy singing with his mom. 🥰 Precious.
The future president looks cool
She is adorable and so awesome!
Ugh so wholesome
Jimmy Fallon. Not my favorite. The Rock. I would sail a thousand ships.
From today on Dwayne is known as the son of Rock’s mom.
wow, is he blushing...

haha, that was great
The Rock's mom is still a beautiful woman
It may just be the camera angle/perspective but the rocks mum looks massive.
She is adorable!
strong women like her are the substitute for the mom I wish I had. I hope I can only be as strong as her
Clearly set up
He lives with his mom?
Swastikas on shirt?
Staged
Staged
Oh a cute viral moment im sure has nothing to do with Young Rock, debuting this week on NBC
You are never too old to have your mom sing to you.
With all his charm I'm calling it now, gonna be a Rock/Hart 2024 ticket lmao
This was great lol
Mom Rock: I'm cooler than Son Rock.

Son Rock: My career is over. 😃
What's the song called?
The Boulder
The rock seemed kinda shy here with his mom and it's so adorable
Ok just wanna say that this hunk of a man is my favorite <3
The rock is one fine ass man 🔥
He still lives with his mom? 
.
.
.

JK: I hope in the future my mom can live with me. As of now we are separated across continents and visa issues.
S
this is adorable. But damn, jimmy fallon is so fucking annoying.
Loving mothers > everything else in the universe
this made me happy
What would his shirt look like if the video was flipped?
Wholesome. 

I feel happiness now, I'm not sure how long it will last, but I feel it.
u/savevideo
This is like any Unus Annus episode with Mark's mom in it.
If this man ran for president, he’s got my vote!
The rock and his mom seem great....hate jimmy
She’s adorable
this comment section lol
This makes me happy for him, and sad that I don't have this relationship with my mom. Really sad.
Dude straight up looks like Dwayne Johnson
We would never have gotten to see something so adorable and amazing if the Rock had done a traditional guest interview in the studio with Jimmy.  Imho, this is one of the best things to come out of the pandemic WFH situation.
Can't stand this im too cynical
I would love to learn those songs . Anyone know what the names are ?
Haha we used to sing this song at primary school
Good to see that the Rock is still as wholesome in real life as in acting.
Jimmy didn’t deserve this.
His head is shrinking? His moms looks bigger
Does anyone know where The Rock got that shirt?
the sand
On a side note, this is the most genuine I've seen Fallon be in a long time. Are all his post-vivid shows like this?
When's the album come out?
Crashes.......it's TV, everything is scripted.
the rock is red
Jimmy's laugh tends to have the opposite effect on me. Though there was a lot of genuine positive emotion in there this time - it's good to know where he stands and what he likes
How many people in the world can steal the thunder from The Rock? That woman is a treasure
Manz out here looking old now.
This is so fricken funny
Poor Dwayne looking old...
I’d like to think this is a prequel to Moana
Hey, I have that uke!
So pure ❤️
That was the best.
How can I love the Rock more? I do.
even during a genuine moment like this, Fallon still manages to pull off a fake laugh!
He looked like he wanted to punch her
Why the rock wearing swastikas?
i watched with sound off and am still smiling
Scripted
This is the best acting I’ve ever seen out of The Rock.
I went to college with the Rock. He played football for University of Miami. Never met him but seems like a cool guy.
Ok hold up does the rock have face surgery?????
She makes the Rock look like a pebble
I truly hate jimmy fallon's forced laugh.
TV gold.  This might just save his show.  One great non scripted bit.
"Mom!  You're embarrassing me!"
No  cameras he would slap the cat lady 🤣
