Hiya, such a great moment, I tried to sketch it...Hope you like it, thanks for posting!

Dude, I watched your interview randomly on youtube and thought you and your girlfriend were hilarious and so cool. Found you again here,  and you are engaged! That's awesome, congratulations!! Glad to see you doing well.
I was expecting this to be a repost bot account, but was actually surprised that it is really you. Thank you, this is very cute.
She is beautiful and you deserve all her kisses and attention
TIL Shane is on Reddit!

Edit upon waking up this morning: Hi Shane!

RIP inbox.
I have a concern about this photo..... Did you order potting soil from Amazon? And if so they just toss it in a box?
Love love looooooooooooooove!
Squirmy n' Grubs!
Yo did I just accidentally stumble upon Shane on Reddit?
Good doggo
What a lovely sheep :)
Shane! Love your vids, hannah and you are amazing people, really inspiring, greetings from mexicoüíñ‚ù§üíñ‚ù§
I just wanna say that I love your channel on youtube. It gives me hope that i‚Äôll find true love when I see you guys together. This is because I too am disabled, I have duchenne muscular dystrophy. Thank you for bringing happiness and joy to my life and many others around the world! :)
I teach at a school for kids with physical disabilities (including SMA) and one of students told me to read your book. It's fantastic. Didn't think I'd run into you in reddit!
Aww doggo kisses üòò
I watch your youtube channel
r/animalsbeingbros

Edit: I didn't know that was an actual subreddit. Well, I know what my next hour is going to be.
Every time you make a post with Chloe, the internet noticeably lifts a little higher out of the chaos and dumpster fires. You guys are so clearly there for each other and I‚Äôm definitely here for you.
I hope you put this on your "Things That Made Me Smile" list because this is adorable
Them shoes is tight
What are you planting? Cute dog btw
Are you that guy from youtube that kind of chronicles your life with your smoking hot wife? Good on you my guy.
1) so cute
2) loved your book
Hi Shane! I love watching you and Hannah. I‚Äôve learned so much from your channel and when I‚Äôm feeling low it is always such a sweet, relaxing thing to have playing (especially lately!). I always recommend your channel to my friends and I look forward to your videos every week. 
I work with physically disabled people and your vlog has given me a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by this population that I wouldn‚Äôt otherwise have. 
Thank you for sharing your lives with all of us!
‚ù§
She is so cute
Such a pair you are! Love this photo‚Äîlifts my spirits!
Shane, my man! It's awesome to see you on reddit, love your videos!
Doesn't this dude normally get hate in other subs?
I have a stepson aged 5 and my Dad has a pitbull. Stepson has only really been around small dogs consistently and pitbull only around larger humans. Watching them meet up is always a blast as stepson loves a larger dog to actually play and run with and pitbull is fascinated by the fact he's head level with someone and can endlessly kiss their face. It's adorable
Yes that‚Äôs awesome! I like the your fence too
Ok awesome. I really miss seeing happy people. 
Really truly do. This made my heart flip.
Shane my only question is why don't you get cool patterns for your afos. Its like fun socks 24/7 I have dinosaurs on my braces.
 Yay! Shane is on Reddit! I‚Äôm happy! You guys make me smile!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I saw the title and immediately knew it was gonna be Shane. Love you dude! Your sense of humor is very similar to mine and you are genuinely hilarious. Everyone should check out his YouTube channel if you haven't already!
You NEVER go ass to mouth.
Very good
That‚Äôs awesome
Wow, I went through your account to see if you had any information about your illness if I could call it that and found your YT channel. Congrats on not feeling small and also making it easier for others to deal with their problems as well.
Bro is Hannah jealous though üßêü§î
Nice, good stuff Shane.  Been awhile since I'd watched a video or saw it in recommended, glad you're still kicking ass!
Poodles are great dogs!
Looks like she found the smile switch!
Hope you know you made me very happy today.
this is the most positive comment section i've seen im so happy
Don't pretend like kisses weren't your plan all along!!
Is that a goldendoodle?
What a sweetheart
I am so happy that you have this. I'm a 6'3" 300 lb man and I'm crying because your happy dude. Your happiness has made me happy inside. Thank you. It's a beautiful thing.

Very cute. Thank you
Nice coat, cute doggie.

Clever girl!
Looks like she is being the best girl.
Badass shoes
My dogs do this with my daughter!!! It's just the sweetest thing!! Until she gets pissed because she wants to move!!
Super cute!!!!

My son uses a chair as well. 

We love your photos!
My heart is melting, so sweet.
Is that a golden doodle? Or full poodle? Either way, such sweet dogs, I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs thrilled to be able to give more kisses!!
Now you can give eachother big hugs!
Is it a Lagotto?
Absolutely fantastic fantastic fantastic üíúüíúüíú.
My dog aims straight for my SO's face whenever he gets in bed.  I swear that dogs have itchy tongues and women just don't have the whiskers up for the job.
Doggo giving zero fucks and all the love.
Dogs are too sweet
Yo those shoes are supa hot
You can just tell by this picture! She is giving you so many kisses!! üíúüíúüíú
Damnit that‚Äôs sweet. Dogs are so awesome.

Very cute, you‚Äôre never going to get enough of them!
Good dog Chloe
Everyone no matter what they have going on in their lives, needs a nice fluffy puppy to comfort them.  I mean everybody.  Even bad people.  Maybe a good boi can convert them to be good people.
You both must be so happy! This is a wonderful photo of the two of you. :)
Those shoes are baller.
Awww!!! So sweet!!
Dude, those kicks are fire! Nice dog too.
Omg i didnt know shane was on reddit üòÄüëç cool.

Ha! Awesome.
Omg someone send a pic of Chloe to WeRateDogs on twitter. Definitely 14/10 material
r/mademesmile
Dude it's on him, live it up!

Chicken soup for the soul
This seems like the opposite of a problem. <3
Ah Shane! This is so cute :) I love watching yours and Hannah‚Äôs videos, they literally make my day! Hello here from Australia :)
Love you Squirmy and Grubs!!!
Just seen your youtube channel. You and your fiancee look so sweet together and it's good to see your both doing well during covid-19 quarantine.
I‚Äôm sensing a little bit of love here...ü§î. Just marauded around your YouTube ch. and various posts here. You‚Äôre a f‚Äôn champion. Attitude may not be everything, but it counts a lot and you have it in spades.
Dogs are the best.  Nice looking doggo too.  Enjoy.
that's a good doggo.
Things that made you smile this week?
I thought I was on YouTube for a second üòÇ. Yay! So happy to see that you are on here ‚ù§Ô∏è
Major awwwwww!
How adorable! Chloe looks like a big girl. Is she mixed or another kind of pudow?
Lucky you!

Dogs are the best.
Cool üëçüëç

My friend's dog does the exact same thing and I love it!
So adorable!
Somebody loves you!
I love when you pop up on my feed!! Thanks to you (and your fianc√©e) for bringing some light and love into the world :)
[deleted]
Aw! Dog kisses are the best kisses! 

What ails you, my dude? You got a pretty badass rig/throne set up there! :)

Edit: nevermind! Checked out you and your fianc√©! You two are dope!
Great pic!!
Shane! I was about to reprimand you for stealing someone else's adorbs photo, but it's you! Hi!
What causes this I'm curious and wanna know this kinda looks interesting and please dont spam me with dog sex guides I'm talking about the guy in the wheelchair
Hi Shane! Do you have trouble escaping her kisses? I'm picturing her chasing you around the house, and loving the mental image!
OMG! Shane! As soon as I read Chloe I thought of you guys but didn't think it would be you! That's so cool! Now we know you're on Reddit lol
Literally my first thought was wait Shane?!?!?! Love you and Hannah's channel! You guys are funny and bring light to certain situations that the average able bodied person wouldn't necessarily think of. Congrats on the engagement btw!!!
I‚Äôve never seen this Redditor before, but noticed the recognition given in this post and decided to visit their history of posts and I have gone down a rabbit hole for the last hour of all the loving and incredibly impressive posts by his account. I finally reached the how to cuddle video and I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying. Congrats on the engagement!
Shane!!! You're on Reddit!! I love your guys' channel. Congratulations on the engagement. Y'all are so funny and fantastic :)
I have an accessibility question, about how you‚Äôre able to use Reddit? My daughter is 7 and much too young for Reddit, but she has severe cerebral palsy and not much control over her limbs. She‚Äôs learning how to use switches with her head after several years she‚Äôs finally gaining some success.
Ooh that's a good handsome boy right there. Huh? Yeah the dog is fine too.

This is the most beautiful thing I‚Äôve seen all day...
You're done for now she knows how to do this
Awwww so cute
Fuck yeah!
Oh you‚Äôre that youtuber guy!

i could never keep my shoes that white! cute dog.
You are such an inspiration dude!  Also, sweet kicks my man.
What's the YouTube channel?
hey i know you from youtube!
Enjoy my manüëçüèª
Ironically that‚Äôs enough to be National Merit.
This is why I like most dogs more than most people
I taught my black lab to give me hugs, i kneel down and he puts his front legs up over my shoulders and buries his head in my neck and it‚Äôs the best feeling in the world. Gotta love a dog all they is unconditional love. Rock on!
Today‚Äôs reminder that we don‚Äôt deserve dogs.
Thisnis beautiful. I must also commend that fence.
Puppy kisses are the best! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Hey Shane! I love your channel and thanks for being a beacon of positivity to everyone.
Awww, what a way to start a morning!
I‚Äôm not crying ... there‚Äôs an eyelash in my eye..
Hey aren't you the guy who did a few couples video and one with Chris from SBSP? Anyways hi! Glad to see you doing well!
Love it!!  So much love and happiness.  Thanks for the smile, random internet friend!
That‚Äôs at least a double aww.
Aww so sweet! Pets are the BEST!

AWWWWWW!!!! xoxox i love you
You‚Äôre a legend man
Hey! I know that guy!
Hey Shane! I am a huge fan! This is so cute!
I like the insulator jacket with the orange inside.
This is why I joined Reddit. Absolutely beautiful.
That's so adorable! You made my day
Is that a cape though?
May I ask what happed to get you in a wheelchair if your comfortable telling me
Great dog, you‚Äôre lucky to have each other
Anybody know what shoes he has on they‚Äôre kinda fresh
Chloe is the bestest girl!!!
Chloe is a sweetheart üíï
Hey, it's Shane and Chloe! You are doing it right if she wants to give you this many kisses. Keep up the good work, mate!
I took a hot take when I saw the guy getting licked by the dog and the dudes face and I looked down and thought,that‚Äôs a cool wheelchair,and if I could have one I would put flame paint stencils on it
Infinitely clean nose hair. What more could a guy want from a gal?
I was going to be  sooooo pissed if this wasn't you, man!  Say hi to your lady from us in AZ.
Dang those shoes look fresh
Precious
Have you ever listened to a Sirus Xm channel 95 comedy radio show called the Bonfire i bet they would love to have you on
Good girl!
I love dogs
.... did you buy old leaves off amazon tho
Nice kicks! 
I need those now.
Nice shoes
ID on the hat? Looks sweet
Good doggo!
Chloe! Such a good, smart girl! That's a best friend for life, for sure.
This is the most wholesome rap battle.
Oh my God that's so wholesome. Also this very good pup has my name
This guys shoes cost more than your rent
Love
Yes
Dogs don‚Äôt see what we see.
Love the shoes man, what make/model?
One new thing that I hope made you smile this week: Chloe's kisses getting popular on Reddit! Haha
She‚Äôs gotten so big from your first post!! I love so much that you and Hannah have this beautiful girl in your lives :)
Nice
Good problem to have
wheelchairs were invented by genetically enhanced hyper intelligent dog overlords to make our faces easier to mlem
Wonderful unexpected result!
That's just wonderful!
How did you type this post?
Aw love her name üíï
Hostas? Nice.
Your curly is an affectionate one...  mine is a cuddler.   Anyone buying a beer for his doggo?
Love your channel. Nice to see you here.
teach doggo that it's ok to get all up in your grill, doggo takes advantage.
I fuck with your shoes
Chloe‚Äôs best day ever. Look at her posture. Thats comfort and happiness, maybe even joy. She‚Äôs as lucky to have you as you are to have her. Bravo.
She‚Äôs absolutely darling.  Good girl! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I have a very important question that is crucial to the stability of the universe: did you give her kisses back? Pls say yes
I love it
I think having a pup who wants to give kisses is one of the best things in life. Kudos!
Dogs are the best!
Dude I love your (and your fianc√©s!) YouTube channel! Nice to see you on Reddit! Thanks for bringing awareness to wheelchair issues, legit I have encountered so many of them! So thank you so much! And your dog is legit the cutest!!!!
Got your nose!
My 90lb catahoula will straight up crawl into my lap like this!! lol he's such a cuddly goober

I probably shouldn't be surprised that you're on reddit, but OMG!! :D
[Milo](https://imgur.com/gallery/rDXgRvt)  thinks Chloe‚Äôs cute üòª
This melts my heart.
If you would go full throttle with that weelchair on the wet lawn i bet you could do some sick donuts! Not so good for the lawn though...
As someone who pushes people in wheelchairs all day does tour jacket on the wheels not drive you crazy?!? (It may not even touch them in this pic it just looks like they do and I could hear it in my head)
She's marvelous.
What am I gonna do about my legs Eddy Murphy?!
That‚Äôs so cute!!!
Hey aren't you the fella from the Netflix show s*x education, it's not nice that you deleted that voice message.

Hey Shane! Love your channel. Just wanted to stop by and say you are the MAN. THE MAN
Can I give you kisses?
Hi Shane! Chloe‚Äôs looking lovely as usual.
Didn't expect to see Shane on Reddit
Too cute Shane...the dog of course. \*runs\*
Shane! Fancy seeing you here!
SHANE! 
I follow you in YouTube after I read your book! Love your humor in it, btw!
I, too, live in the Minneapolis area, and I hope I bump into the both of you & grab drinks!!!
Ha! I just fangirled so hardcore. No clue you were on Reddit! What a super sweet pic of you and Chloe!
I went to school with your brother! Hope you all are doing well! It‚Äôs a small world!
Hheeeeyyyyyy!!!!!! You and Hannah are the best!
So lovely to see 'Ol Grubs on my feed. Love you guys! Looking forward to the Laughing At My Nightmare virtual 5K!

Relieved this isn‚Äôt a Sr. Graffo post...
Cute dog !
Hey yall! Great to see you on Reddit. I absolutely love your YouTube videos.
I saw your post a while ago when you posted with your doggo going for a walk together and u/schnoodledoodledoo made an amazing adorable poem.

Then I started getting into your channel on YouTube and it's just fantastic! I went into a YouTube spiral of interabled YouTube couple videos and the folks are simply fantastic.

Thanks so much for being a super wholesome human, y'all are so fantastic :)

And also your doggo is amazing
I love his story. And I love him. Congrats.
She‚Äôs a sweetie:) Your fortunate to have each other to love. Dogs are the best peoples;)
Serious question (are they allowed here?): Does she help you out like an assistant dog, or does she just provide endless love?
Is that a menchie shirt ??
Adorable, my brother has a service dog and she does this lovely thing where she screams when he leaves the house without her. Service dogs naysh unite!
Hi Shane
Cute dog! I like your shoes too
You need to give some cuddles in exchange for those kisses!
Beautiful!
it‚Äôs possible
Hi Shane and Hannah! I love your videos!
Adorbs
This is so wholesome oml
Side note, nice shoes!
I admittedly do not keep up with your youtube channel, I'll go for months without watching and then binge everything in a day - so it was very nice to randomly see you on reddit! Hope you and Hannah and Chloe are doing well :)
What a good girl!
Hi Shane - can you please post a link to your channel (I assume it's youtube?).  I'd love to check it out.  Thanks!
Awwwww Chloe!!!
Earned a sub, you might not read this but keep it up man. Heres a beer from texas.
Ah ha! Easier access for kisses! You fell for her devious plot! Muah ha ha!
Standard poodles and doodles are awesome.
What kind of dog
I see this as an absolute win
Is it possible to die from love, come back.. type this and die again? I did.
I dig your shoes! Serious question though, how long on average do a pair of shoes last for you?
Lucky
Dogs are the best.
This is one wholesome comments section
Fresh kicks, bro
Congrats, now you're going to be permanently soggy faced, lol! Thx for sharing.
I didn't know you were on reddit!
Good doggo. And what you have there is the opposite of a problem. Enjoy all the kisses!
Sounds perfect!!
Wow fantastic
Chloe is a good pup. Nice work!
Hey, you're Shane Burcaw! From one Shane to another, gotta say, I love your book and YouTube channel. Keep making stuff, I love it all!
Ah! Shane! You and Chloe are now my Monday Made Me Smile. I live with disabilities and have always found comfort in you & Hannah, Cole & Charisma, and Jessica & Claudia Kellgren-Fozard. Thank you for giving me plenty of binge watching material while in quarantine!
Ayy nice kicks man. I have the same ones!
Nothing wrong with that!
Nice dog
She‚Äôs trying to eat you because she thinks you‚Äôre a vegetable

It's over Shane, she has the high ground!
