Love how he wipes the dog slobber on his girlfriend
Typical Berner! So cuddly!
What a doofus! I love it
Oh man! We have a 8 month old Bernese named Toby and he is like identical. Attitude and all. We call him an “active cuddler” since he can’t sit still for a second.
Ah yes, serotonin
No girlfriend. Only doggo.
This is exactly what I needed to see today. Thank you.
Oh god so happy I sorted by new
The humans: chilling on the couch

The dog: Let me get some of that!

Our new 11m old berner loves sitting like a human on the couch and flopping like this when you sit beside him. 

Berner love.
I’ve had 5 Berners over the last 28 years. None had wet mouths. 2 died of cancer. The 3 that didn’t get cancer lived to 12 and 13 years. 
For me their incredible personalities and kind nature outweighs the cancer risks. 
I can’t imagine having a different breed.
What a goof ball!
Her laughter made me smile.  I had a friend die of COVID today.  I needed to smile.  Thank you.
lol, Thanks for the laughs, my husky loves doing this as well haha
I want this in my life
It’s so cute, I literally just exploded (I’m typing this from heaven).
"Ooopsies you stopped petting me there for a second"
Why do all these videos now have weird circus music over them?
The doggo is like a lil kid saying “watcha doooooin?” Loll
Throuple goals.
[removed]
What a ham!
I just want one moment similar to this and then i can die a happy man
I just realized how single I am
my leonberger did this

she would always use her head as a battering ram against my head when she wanted affection

she always won

RIP
*cries in single and petless*
I want this. This is all I want out of life. This right here. Don't care about having a nice car, a big house, a high-powered job or kids. If these were my last moments on Earth, I'd die happy.
"The autopsy said they died of suffocation, but we don't know how."

"Perhaps it was criminal, there was an awful lot of foreign hair found on the bodies?"
Lol. Such a camera hog.
Adorable video. Could’ve done without the annoying music.
These types of moments with our partners and pets might be the best moments of all of our lives. 

Delightful joy and happy to be alive & in love
My husky HATES cuddling. I can't even hold this man's hand and he gets up and walks away. He only cuddles when it's convenient to him which is usually when I'm watching a movie and he decides to sit on my head.
See you and this pupper on the front page!
Are Bernese mountain dogs as soft as they look? He looks as soft as my cat
😁
Haha this is cute even if I’ll never have it and end up dying alone haha
Have Berner. They must be ALL like this.
I love the dog's look when the guy starts giggling his lip, like 'Ew, stop being weird!'
What is this music though?  I feel like Bob Saget should have introduced this clip.
Dogs!! Huge dogs have no idea how big they are when they are trying to be lap dogs. There is more of a dog to cuddle when you need it.
What a lucky guy. I wish i had someone to cuddle like that. The girl is just a bonus.
Dogs are my favorite
Family Unit!
What breed is this ?
u/Savethisvideo
What a big beautiful fur baby.


He has no idea what personal space is.


Love it!!
smothered by the doggie lol
My Cat does this too, too cute.
Interesting to see a post like this rocket to the top of reddit.  Perhaps we are returning to normalcy.
Thank you for making me smile! What a beautiful doggy! I love that they are *always* blissfully unaware of their size 😂💙
I need this kind of needy dog in my life. I feel like when I'm stressed more, I need never ending physical affection and I feel like this dog can offer that service.
Pooch saw the makings of a snuggle pile, what was he gonna do? *Not* jump in on the action?
I love how much dogs love us.
u/elytion *this* please
what a lovely boi!
The big goof!
The joy
The smells
Oh my lord, this is adorable.
What a happy family!
As a straight man, I must say...  


That dude look cuddly af.
Doggo-"I'm gonna steal your man and your spotlight"

You know, I am ok with that in this case 🐶❤️
What a sweetheart!
I upvoted too early because it kept getting better
I’m not a big dog person but Berners are just the best. Always happy to know ya, ready for loves.
MUST. GET. CLOSER

This dog is clearly helping the woman to cuddle the man significantly better. 10/10 helpful doggo.
Personal space??? What's that??
Now I need a Bernard
“I am a lap dog”
The definition of pure happiness is this video right here
"puppy pile!" - Dog, probably
Big goofy dogs never know their own size.
This just made my day. 😂😂😂🤣🤣
We don't deserve a dog's love.
I know this feeling completely. My SO's dog is a two year old Treeing Walker Coonhound/Lab mix that has been cuddly since day one. If you sit on a chair, he's climbing it to sit on you. Sit on a couch, and suddenly his belly is on your shoulder. Lay in bed to cuddle, and he will literally try to lay between us. I love him, even if he is a 55-pound love torpedo.


Here is some evidence from a few weeks ago:

[https://i.imgur.com/r7YBedb.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/r7YBedb.jpg)
So gorgeous. Miss my boi so much. Passed away this year. A big old Labrador called Booma. We were all laughing crying and generally crying really at how much that big boi is missing from our lives. We are more than lucky to have them with us - we are blessed. Not sure I’ll have another dog in our lives yet, a bit raw still. But seeing videos like this makes my whole family happy and appreciative for what we had 💚
He’s perfect
I am unbelievably jealous of that woman
That is the dumbest looking dog I've ever seen, I love him
Nothing brightens my day more than seeing a burner on front page.  

This is an accurate depiction of all burners.
He wanna be part of the cuddles!
Give me attention!!! This is awesome 🤣
I can’t stop smiling!!
I am starting to despise this stupid music added thing.
Come on, op.  Dont crop out the original persons tag
Source? Was this on tiktok? I need to see more of this pup.
Bernese Mountain Doof
Did you steal my dog to make this video?! My Berner does exactly the same thing, same goofy grin with her tongue hanging out! They are such wonderful dogs...except for the fur tumbleweeds.
Bernese really are the best. No concept of personal space though.
I love Burmese mountains dude, want one so bad
Berners are the best
Once you’ve had a Bernese Mountain dog there isn’t anything that come close. Such a beautiful breed
“No love life, only pets”
I think I need a dog. And a girlfriend.
This is so pure. I love it.
What else do you need? This looks like pure happiness.
I’m weeeak 😭
All the Berners I have met have a need to melt into any human they meet.  They CANNOT get close enough.  It is amazing.
I have two Berners and can confirm that they are the center of the known and unknown universe.
“Somebody used to be my cuddle buddy...now there’s somebody in the way”
This is what life is all about, moments like this :)
My parents have 2 of these now (1 year apart from the same parents) and they are just like this. Both of them are just giant love bugs. It’s so hilarious watching them just run around constantly leaning on people and begging for affection. 

Dumb and dumber is what they’re commonly referred to as
This is the kind of life that I want
Bernese dogs are big lap dogs, I love them
Dogs are the best.
Puppy needs lots of attentions lol
This guy has everything I need in my life
Cuddles for everyone.
Goober.

S/He is cute AF.
That’s a nice derp.... I mean dog you got there....
Irish president approved!
Dog pile!!
Dog: what are you doing guys can I join you guys let me see what is that?
THERE IS SO MUCH LOVE IN THIS VIDEO
That doggo smile.
This is adorable!
Absolutely love it!
Passed the phone to my husband and said, (as our Berners lay across our laps), “This is the most Berner thing I’ve seen all day.” They’re SO velcro! 😂😂
All the reasons needed to get a dog in 30 seconds. Joy.
Happy doggo + happy family/couple = YES YES YES AND MORE YES🥺🥺🥺
he’s like “...why u wanna cuddle with her??”
SIMPLY ADORABLE
I really miss my dog she was loving just like this but she is in a better place now
The single people of reddit don't need to be attacked like this smh
My cat when I’m on Reddit in bed, I swear. Where’s this affection when I’m ready to sleep??
Really wish it was just the audio without the whimiscal music added.
Now *that's* all I want in life
"I see you are enjoying a cuddle. I also enjoy cuddles."
he just wants to join the cuddle puddle
That looks more like "mom you're in my way for dad cuddles"
Is this what women want?
this is so cute that i feel like the good boi is touching me
That's one reason i love St B's they LOVE attention i want one SO BAD
Such a cutie! My 7 year old asked me what his name is. When I told him that I don't know, he said it looks like a Ben.
A cat would shit in the corner, angrily piss on your shoes and then claw you.
Idiot, why won't you pet him!!!!!!!
This post is pure happiness

also a great reminder of what Im missing out on
That’s one happy poochie right there! He’s obviously well loved! Sweet family!
“Um guys I want to take part in the snuggling”
If a relationship isn't like that, I don't want it then
I just wanna know where these atrocious songs come from and whom we need to draw and quarter to stop their production.


Sweet dog tho.

The music really makes this!
Haha awesome couple!

Bernese Mountain dog?
r/mademesmile
I guess he is the reason why Wald Disney made Goofy like he is and called him Goofy.

Dogs are goofy and it's lovely.
Pet the damn dog! Or maybe not, because then it gets rewarded for this stuff. Unless the owners like that, then pet away.
YOU REPLACED ME NOW I REPLACE YOU @&$&$
That’s a happy family!
But when *I* act like this; I’m just annoying.
Nice bernese mountain dog
Frame @ 00:10 is t-shirt , painting ect material🖖🏽
I can't tell if the couple is cuter or the dog
Bernese mountain dogs are such goobers! My border collie has a little Bernese in him! His personality really stands out from other collies.
I love this!!
Love it.
Funny thing: dogs get jealous when humans start cuddling, because they want cuddles too.
I desperately needed to see this today. ❤
So cute😂😂😂❤️
We don't deserve dogs

I don't really care but if you are going to repost don't cut out the credit
“Oh did someone say dog pile?”
Our Berner does the exact same thing lol
Yeah that fluffy chest deserves a pet lmfaoo
Awww so cute!! He wants some hugs too, he doesn't want to feel left out XD
Excellent
What a lovable goof
truly envy you guys :)
Man I hope I have something like this someday. What a cute lil family
OMG! we dont deserve dogos
I know how that dog feels :(
YUUUUUUUGE DOGGO
Just as derpy as our berner. Adorable!
I was wondering where the dirty punchline was, and then realized I actually scrolled over to “Popular”.
Woah, I thought that was Finneas and Billie Eilish at first
I love messing with my dog's floppy cheeks.
That looks like my ex and her bf. I'm really glad they are happy.
This is so wholesome! What a good doggo !!!!! You made my kids crack up! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤗
These are the best moments in life.
Berner Sennen are the sweetest.

If there are no dogs in heaven then when I die I want to go where they went.
You guys look wonderfully happy. Your lovely pup is precious.  Keep smiling and laughing. 😁❤
He is jealous of your gf....
Proper
Omg he looks like my friend Shawn and his rescue Patches!
Dogs are just so damn good for the soul.
He’s just telling your gf to move so he can give dad a cuddle.
Oh my God! My Berner does the same thing when we don’t pet him! He’ll brush up against us and sit on our foot. I love them so much, such great dogs!
What a goof, I love it

That's comfy 😊
So this is where my Berna-Doodle gets it? He’s just a big suck.
BIG BABYYYYYYYYYYYYY
What a goof!
He’s jealous
There are things redditors do a lot that annoys me, one of those things is repeating stuff. One thing I'll never ever get annoyed at people saying is "we don't deserve dogs".
Pets are the only third wheel allowed by all parties.
That's a big floof
Just wanted to make sure! So sweet!
This communication with body language is so subtle, can any dog experts translate?
Best video I’ve seen today !
Fine, I'll give you my virtual pet. You a good boy.
If your dog doesn’t do this your dog is broken
"oh oops were you cuddling, don't mind me" such a cutie
Relationship goals
Doggo thought it was a...wait for it...**dog pile**!!
I feel like it’s a girl, and she’s saying ‘Come on ! I’m cuter than her!’
My saint Bernard does the same thing, and it's so cute even if she crushes me
All fun and games until the Berner clobbers you with his massive head. Mine flails his head when he wants attention, and on too many occasions he's clobbered me in the face with it. He's still a very good floofer regardless.
**DOG PILE !!**
What a ham.
Not the dog
That is just too freaking funny
Togetherness.
yeah no, i... I love being... single...
Big dogs rule!
What a love bug.
Typical Bernese lol. My boy does the exact same to my wife and I.

It’s a shame these dogs live such short lives
So cuteeeee
r/bernesemountaindogs
dogs are awesome. I miss having one
Dang I kinda envy those two.. like a lot
Omgggg this is amazing thank you
I firmly believe that the bigger the dog, the bigger the doofus.
They chose good music for a change. It matches.
He seems to be bigger than both of them and the best part is that they tried to do something but instead made something way better
Lol what an adorable nerd
The music makes this so much better
I thought this was Linus from LTT
This weird pillow is in my way plz pet me.
This somehow reminds me of the "Hmmm... popcorn!" dog
let's cuddle together 💕
This is very relatable for me with a big dog.
Big boof, the woof
Oh dog the amount of drool.
What a happy family
Absolutely the sweetest!
WHOLESOME in every way possible.
You guys made me smile and happy, here take my upvote. ⬆️
This made me happy
That is my life goal 🥺
Awwwwwww doggo
Haha my puppy does this too. Whenever me and my gf are sitting close or cuddling at all, she gets so excited and tries to wedge between us and be the center of our attention and just bask in the love.
Pack snugs!
You can tell these two are going to be great parents of their human children too
why do they look like Claudia and Phinneas lol
Awwwww I love this
What a goofball, I need a big fluff like this in my life!
Now I love my Border Collie, but I would love a dog to show me some affection like this. Our BC is more cat than dog, she tolerates my existence, insomuch as I feed and and take her for walks, but cuddles don't happen...
Omg if you need a dogsitter hit me up
I love big goofy dogs!!!
They're like big Ole aussies
What a sweet loveable goofball.You two are so lucky😄
I love how he just wipes his hand on his girlfriend after he sticks his fingers in the dog mouth. 😂 But I wouldn't care if I were her. I want a gigantic fluff. But, just for a bit not always.
So cute omg
The dude is hot
Arrrgg! This makes me happy! 😊
My dog every morning when he hears me wake up.
I had a Saint, talk about slobber...and cow pies...
What a sweetie
Omg what a big derp
Cute family
There are one or two of these big floofers around where I live, they're always being walked and I love seeing how happy they are when walking, I drive past on my way home from work and seeing the floofers makes me feel so much happier. Thank you to those that own big floofers, I enjoy seeing them on walks (can't get my own dog).
When I first saw this I thought it was linus tech tips
Gotta diddle the flap
I love this!  My dog acts the same, nothing like a 70 pound lap dog.  Enjoy receiving the love!!
it is disgusting to me.

You are happy and I am not. You have someone to love, someone to hold, someone who cares for you, a best friend. I do not. You Are What I Am Not and That Hurts Me. I am Disgusted by You.
Awe that’s cute! Every time my boyfriend and I hug/kiss/show affection his dog Annie just starts humping the crap out of me.. think she’s jealous
Motha fuckin good doggo
WHOSE A GOOD BOY
The Dog Is a Paid Actor
I can’t wait to have a little family like that

I want this kind of relationship!
my aussie does this shit she will sit on my chest and face like she isnt 53lbs
My corgi/hound mix does this all the time. He even moves my hand until it’s in the right spot on belly.
Girlfriend<dogo
That’s some serious FOMO
Does this dog have an Instagram?
I frickin love Bernese Mountain Dogs. My sister has one and can confirm that they are massive lap dogs that have goofy personalities. Love em.
That’s love, baby
This just made my day
disgustingly happy video. i’m sickened
My staffy does the same --do I hear snuggles?! let me get in on some of that!
My dog 100% lol
Let me tell you, I don't like dogs. 

But I have to admit, after viewing your video, that I understand why people like them. Have an updoot.
Thanks, I'm lonely
Got in front of the camera “hi”
We are not worthy of dogs. So damn cute.
His name better be goose cause he’s the silliest I’ve ever seen

I mean I would hog the camera if I was the best looking in the family
Can confirm, our Bernese is as equally oblivious, wonderfully needy and derpy.
So handsome

This is the life I want. Just me and my pup. Wait! There's a girl too?... Ahh, nevermind.
What's his name??
That is a very good dog
CUTEEEE
I need attention homies.
If you get a berner, expect this. Or something like this. The do not know their size nor do they care about personal space. They’re insanely smart but dopes!

My brothers puppy would run at you full speed and throw her entire side at you. Just for a belly rub. My parents rescue is 5’4” on her hind legs and gives hugs. She is an amazing judge of strength and will come up for a hug slowly on shorter people.
I love Berners so much. My sister’s year old Berner does things like this and ugh my heart. 🥺
I always love when dogs make you part of the sleeping pile
Finally, a good awww post, you are adorable :)
Just me an my hooman. Nothing to see back here! HE'S MINE!
“yes hello i am here as well where is my love”
A Bernese Mountain Dog is absolutely the best decision anyone can make.
what a beautiful little family.
Good puppy 🐶
Dogs are so awesome

The 2014 Vanoss video music makes this so much better.

Does anyone even know the actual name of the song? Me and my friends only know it as "Vanoss music".
Oh man I wish I get to be this lucky on day!! Such a lovely dog!

Mom doesn’t need to be in the video just you and me dad lol
I feel like big dogs know there big but wanna see what they can get away with
Poor girl.
I legit though that was Linus.
Which is the breed bro
nice pictur

What song is this?
 This dog is absolutely jealous of your girlfriend. This is the typical behavior.
All fun and games untill it turns into cursed threesome.😈
So that’s where Tank gets it! His Bernese side!! Lol
Floofer-Woofers are the best
he just wants in on the cuddle puddle
Every time I hear this music I think of classic vanoss
My German Shepherd does the same thing when I cuddle my seven year old. He also attempts this when I cuddle my wife.

I think he loves us.
Did you guys get this dog together or was/is he one of yalls prior to the relationship?
Dang that gurl getting  S A N D W I C H E D
You guys win best post of the day!
We think it’s cute but that behavior is dominance.
This was better left on mute. Oh god that music is awful.
If I had an award I would give it to this.
Stop showing off your perfect life
Happy moments like this are the most precious things in someone's life. Glad you shared!
My 130lb Black Russian Terrier does exactly the same thing.

What is that music actually from
"I am the big floof! Love me!"
The bigger the boy the gooder he is
"LET ME BE LOVED!"
This is what my dog does too!!
I love you pushy dog!
Ooohhh he knows EXACTLY what’s he’s doing
I miss my Berny. Biggest teddy bears, shame they have such a low life expectancy.
Hamming it up for the camera lol
I love how she just disappeared lol
The music is epic. It took this video to the next level.

When you try to cuddle but the dog cuddles harder

💓💓💓💓so friggin sweet!!!!
Makes me happy
Men only want one thing and it's fucking disgusting
There's a reason the term "dog pile" was made.
My rottweiler and pitbull are both the same way.  They want to snuggle hard core.  They lay right on top of us, whether you can take it or not. This morning the pittie squashed my eyeball with her cheekbone, silly girl! The last foster pittie was the worst.  She wasn't happy unless she was inside your skin with you.  I adore a big, snuggly dog!
I sooo needed that laugh.  What an attention ho!   So unloved.
Which breed is this???
The clueless third wheel in every story
Big lug!
I am jealous of everyone in this video
Hahaha awwww he just wants to cuddle too. Look at that happy smile
I want that, I want to be loved like that, both from dog and female
Can anyone tell me what kind of dog he is??
