he‚Äôs so shiny!
I just recently became a dad.  Do I have to sweep my lawn now or is this a regional thing?
That is what the witch in life number three always used on him. 
I mean, it's a full body brush.  It's like a little kitty car wash.  What's not to love?
r/brushybrushy
Yard broom?
I have one that love to be lint-rolled.
If it's stupid and it works, it isn't stupid. 
One thing people need to realize about cats - they are VERY selective. Every cat is different. It's not unusual for them to hone in on random things and deem that as their "favorite." 

For instance, my cat loves a particular blanket so much that she will follow it to whatever chair I put it on and hang out/nap on it. :P

Can‚Äôt seem to get the dirt off this floor boy.
It‚Äôs a cat dad.

Cats are weird, man. 
Ahhh cats. 

Always there to remind us that random useless garbage is more entertaining to them than the stuff we spend lots of money on to entertain them with. 

Is my apartment floor covered with packing paper because I'm a slob, or is it because my cat was more interested in the paper than the cat tree that came in the box with the paper? 
I just watched this 4 times in a row without realizing it annnnnnnnd number 5 let's do this

&#x200B;
He likes it rough, maybe he's one of those cats that like booty slaps.
Black cats man.. I have three. They are a trip 
My mom had a cat that hated brushes of all sorts but she loved to be vaccuumed with the hose attachment. I aint lyin. The cat died many years ago and I always wished I coulda got it on video.

i am the cat

who hates the groom

but Loving that - 

the dad's yard broom

my back he brush 

n keep me neat

n'er in a rush

aMazing feat!

my cat frens hate

the brushes, fine

but None are great

as This one - *mine!*




Look at that coat!  He‚Äôs a lovely, glossy blue-black color!  
Get those damn pesks out of my fur
Same logic as being indifferent toward the thing you had mail-ordered for your cat but loving the box it came in.
"Enough with these soft cat toys, give me the real deal."  - Cat
For how long has he been doing that? 
That's fucking adorable. What a great cat.
I love the "yes, right on my face" part
That‚Äôs a ‚Äúdanger tail‚Äù if I‚Äôve ever seen one
I'm totally selling those as cat brushes. billions of dollars. BILLIONS HAHAHA
Cats are just contrarians about things being used for their intended purpose.

Boxes are not for packing and shipping.

Brushes are not for grooming.

Cat beds are not for sleeping.

And this broom is not for sweeping.
My question is how did they work out the cat liked this??????
Your cat is a special cat who wags her tail when she‚Äôs happy. 
Maybe you just aren't brushing him aggressively enough.
This is extra special to me because my dad loves his jet black cat in the most precious ways - he uses an unused bbq brush (crazy I know, but the cat loves brushing herself with the damn thing while my dad patiently holds it out for her)


The thing is, my dad is the last person youd think would bond with a cat. My brother sort of dumped her at my parents house and they had no choice but to take her in. She was a bitey, snarly raging bitch of a cat, and my dad is this manly guy who grew up with hunting hounds and always refused to get a cat for us growing up. Now they are like two peas in a pod, hanging out in the yard or the garage together. Mom says she wakes him up at 3am by purring on his pillow and he coos to her. I just cant believe it because he would be so pissed off at the thought of our dog on the beds. 


Sorry had to share. Too damned cute.
I love how hes actually just sweeping the cat. Not even trying to gently brush him with it. 
Look at those happy tail flicks. 
By the way the cats wagging his tail looks like it's about to light that guy up.
Cat likes the hard pets
Just like the witches used to do!
That is the cutest thing i have seen all day. 
Sandals. Shorts. Jacket. 

Dad confirmed. 
Show of hands, who has a ‚Äúyard broom‚Äù?


Sorry to break it to you, but I think he just super loves your dad
Broom the Cat!
LOOKS LIKE IT'S SWEEPIN TIME

GOTTA SWEEP SWEEP SWEEP
The Cats never getting married. 
Don't mind me, just sweepin' my cat.  You know, as you do. 
Cats are weird. I bought mine all sorts of cat beds. An expensive fuzzy one, a cave type one, a strawberry shaped one, a plush one, a round drawstring one. She wouldn't step foot in any of them. Put a garbage bag down on the floor and she's on it! Put a piece of packing paper on it, you know the kind from amazon boxes, she's snoozing like the happiest kitty. So strange!
Ahhhh the keep on going reach.
Cats having a joke too close to Halloween for a  broom thrashing 
Cats are funny like that. Its like they know that all those toys I buy are toys, so they ignore them on purpose but chase after tin foil balls instead. 
That reminds me of my cat. He's very picky about the way he likes to be petted, sometimes he'll tolerate it but other times he'll decide he doesn't like and leave, or turn around and gently bite you. But if you're walking by and use your foot to pet him, he fucking LOVES that. 
My cat used to love being vacuum cleaned and would always get under my feet untill I gave her a good cleaning. 

Such a weird but awesome cat 
Kitty!  What a beautiful coat.  
Whatever works lol
Ah, I see you have a cat of culture as well
Looks and feels like mommy‚Äôs pink, bristly tongue üëÖ 
Every cat brush?   That‚Äôs a sweeping statement 
Have you tried a Kong Purple brush! It‚Äôs made of silicone and my cats that don‚Äôt like wire brushes love it. Buy it cheap on Chewy not in a store.
Probably smells like dead rodents or some smell cats are fond off. Swept up a few pounds of cat nip or something.
The man has dolphin legs, I'm so jealous.
It's like that one cat that loves to be slapped 
He likes it rough
I guess a witch lost her cat
this is cute, a very good post it makes me go like "aww"
Shine like a mofo!!!
Yard broom has all the smells. Take your cat brush and rub it on the lawn.
Boy, your dad has nice legs. Beautiful kitty!
Ah yeah... brush meh moah
I‚Äôm going to have to start using my yard brush to brush my hair because that shine is everything.
Imagine what people driving by think ü§£

r/blackcats 
Meanwhile my cat runs from the broom like it's the reaper and it's got his number.
Is this considered good luck? 
This made me breathe fast through my nostrils 
I almost blew my lunch out my nose because I was not expecting him to be "brushing" him with such vigor. 
Broom the kitty broom the kitty 
You must brush firmly for maximum contentment.
Its at times like these when i wonder how this information was brought to light
That is a manly man‚Äôs cat right there.
Dang, your dad is really going at it. The cat must like it rough.
Meanwhile, my cat thinks the broom is death coming for him.
My cat prefers the lint roller for some reason. 
Do I attack? Na feels goods
I think you just gave me a business idea
My cat runs as soon as I take a broom out to sweep. 
Did he just accidentally sweep the cat one day? How do you even find out the cat likes being swept?  
Yup. My cats hate their brushes but just love my big ol paddle brush 
\*brushes face 

Cat: "homan no"

\*continues brushing face

Cat: "homan i sai--- ohhhh yes thats the spot!"
Well doing that means all the loose hair stays out side that's plus. Btw they make silicon gloves that work real well for grooming cats. Cat thinks you just petting it. But you will have a bunch of hair you can easily put in trash
r/brushybrushy
I had a cat that really liked being vacuumed
My cat that I had growing up loved to be broomed as well! Couldn't sweep the floor cause she was always in the way trying to get brushed. Thought she was the only one!
Got to love cats. Just like buying them toys and they love the box it comes in.
As someone who suffers from cat allergies, I approve!
Is it actually getting any hair off of him?
I have one of those bamboo back scratchers, and our cat goes nuts for it. She loves it so much more than any other scratcher we‚Äôve ever got her. 
Cats just live to confuse us. 
My cat will cry if I sweep the house and do not sweep him. 
It probably doesn‚Äôt shock him with static.
Cats are so weird.

I love them so much 
The fuck is a yard broom? 

I knew cats were secretly witches in disguise 
Cats are weird. 
*agressive petting*
Sandals. Shorts. Jacket. 

Dad confirmed. 
Maybe you're not brushing the cat aggressively enough. Here, let dad show you how to brush hair. This is why all my girls hate for me to brush their hair. That cat is just a masochist!
All I can think of is how well off do you need to be to own a "yard broom" lol
Ngl this cat made me cry out loud because he so darn cuteee 
bet it's because it's already got it's smell on it so it doesn't recognize it as something foreign or dangerous.
I'm obviously not adulting correctly. I don't have a poop knife OR a yard broom. 
Seems to work far as making the cat‚Äôs coat look luxurious too.
His fur looks so smooth and lustrous üòÇ
Is it me or is that cat huge?
perfect October halloween post. A black cat and a witches broom. 
Who had the idea to sweep the cat in the first place?

As the owner of 2 black cats I can confirm that they are the silliest things ever.
I‚Äôm just imagining how he found out that the cat likes the broom... he was probably just sweeping the floor one day, saw the cat laying there (in the way most likely), and decided to sweep over him without even thinking twice about it... it‚Äôs a cat owner thing.
Ahhhh the keep on going reach.
That is without a doubt the shiniest cat on the block.

Honey, did you sweep the cat today?
tf is a yard broom
Yesterday I found out I have Aphantasia and that other people can see actually see pictures in their minds.

Today I find out people have brooms for their yards and use them to brush cats.

The internet will kill me by the end of the week.
Dude's a viking since birth
No rhyme or reason what they will like or hate. And just when you think you know them...you don‚Äôt! 
Try it at home with your cat. Go ahead, grab the broom and sweep the cat. I bet your cat will love it. 
My dog hates every dog brush but loves being combed with cheap, plastic forks.
Sweep da kitty 
Sorry Janet I can't make it...I gotta sweep my cat! 
My cat has an irrational fear of brooms. I‚Äôve tried everything to relax him with it and it‚Äôs a strict no from him. Same with cat brushes it‚Äôs a wrestling match, I‚Äôm lucky he‚Äôs not the scratching or biting type because he‚Äôs long haired not brushing him isn‚Äôt an option.

So a yard broom does not surprise me at all.
I wonder if its a scent issue...

Reddit has taught me that this is some how sexual for the cat. 
https://youtu.be/F_JqkY2Pb2o
IANAC but man, that looks like it feels ecstatic..
Probably because it has a similar texture to a cats tongue. He would probably also enjoy soggy sand paper.
Somehow this is the most Asian thing I've seen all year.
ah hahaha- this is such a cat way of being. 
l a r g e b o i e
they taught us about this in high school, it's called heavy petting
We just gave up with brushes. My cat likes the sweeper  
This is hilarious and adorable! One of my cats hates to be brushed but loves the lint roller! 
Buy a cat deshedding glove! My cat loves it so much he drools and purrs the whole time. It's like he's high.

Fuck it, try steel wool. That masochistic cat might even be into it.
this IS a thing!
My Ex‚Äôs cat loved to be raked. Like with the flimsy plastic rakes. She loved that shit
What a weirdo. Lol
Maybe the thicker, more rigid plastic bristles don't pull his fur as much as the special brushes.
Why would he try the new ones when he already has a favorite? ;)

Cats are unique, just like us \^\^
My grandpa had the exact same broom for about 15+ years.
Maybe when he sees you sweep the drive way and then sees a car drive on it he is hoping that if he gets swept he too will get driven on. Domestic cats have evolved to be as suicidal as we are.

Just like the witches used to do!
Maaan these cats won't play with toys or sleep in beds we buy for them and now it's the brush! On the other hand my cat absolutely hates being brushed, and he might have wanted this treatment all along.
Judging from those slippers and his familiarity with a broom.... I'm guessing your dad is asian, isn't he?
thats the cats reward for being the best mole killer in town for their dad. i have a big black cat just like this named bubby, my dad loved him for that and just recently got a cat to take his place since i moved out. now bubby doesnt get to go outside from his downtown apartment where his sister muffins is really little and annoying him all day. sorry guy, im working 60 hours this week and 80 next week to get us a mortgage.

I wonder how it started.
If you're talking about the metal wire brushes, try natural fiber/boars hair brushes for people. My cats won't have anything else and one cat will TAKE YOU DOWN if he sees you pick it up, but will actively avoid you if you have one of the "pet brushes" in your hand.

Is a yard broom anything like a poop knife? Who all has one? Should I? Am I missing out?
Are you sure he loves it? The way he twitches his tail leads me to believe otherwise. Typically cats do this when they're annoyed. It's common to see this tail swishing right before a warning bite.

Am I whooshing or can you really not see that the cat obviously fucking hates it? 
It is so cute how this cat probably gets jabbed in the eye while making this video. I'm sure it's not the first time this cat was brushed like this and if he didn't get a bristle in the eye this time what about the other times?  If you must use the broom on the cat can you just not include the head. Just a bad idea but idiots will be idiots.
