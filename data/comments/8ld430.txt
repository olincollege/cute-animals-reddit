That face with the tongue hanging out!
Damn these comments turned on op real quick 
Are you saying you snuck a dog into a dog free event?
Totally nailed the serious and goofy shot combo.
Your boyfriend looks very happy to see you
Tbh maybe people don‚Äôt wanna deal with your dog at their graduation.
I don't want to be that guy, but this actually strikes me as pretty selfish. If pets weren't allowed, it was for a reason. This might have made you happy, but there are people in this world who are allergic to and/or terrified of dogs and some of them were probably at this graduation. (My son was nipped by a friend's border collie when he was four and was scared to death of dogs for three years after that despite our best attempts. He'd have freaked the hell out if he'd been anywhere near the dog.) 

Just...not everyone has the same feelings as you do about your animals, people. If someone has specifically requested you to not bring dogs, it doesn't seem like much of a hardship to...not bring your dog. 

(Edit to add, in the interests of this not turning into a total pile-on, that the original user has clarified below that the dog wasn‚Äôt actually in the crowds at the ceremony, as I had interpreted her post, but just in an area behind the crowds where (or at least near where) animals are allowed/expected. Seems much more reasonable than how I‚Äôd read it. That said I DO think there‚Äôs a conversation to be had about people thinking everyone loves their animal just because THEY do - but this sub is probably not the place!)
"Oh! Are we taking pictures? Well, then..."

*<<derrrrp>>*
I'm convinced r/aww exists solely for grown adults to come up the most childish and ridiculous names to call animals
You can be without your dog for a few hours. Please follow the simpler rules in life.
 Why? You could have taken those pictures in your backyard and had the same effect. Thinking you're above rules to get a stupid picture. It's a fucking dog. It doesn't give to squats in the back yard that you graduated. 
I know I will be downvoted. But this is as entitled as you can get. There's a time and a place for animals. This isn't one of them. 
Uhm why couldn't you just taken pics of you and your dog in your own backyard another time and just wear your cap and gown? If dogs weren't allowed, why bring a dog? Other people graduated too; be respectful of the rules. I have a dog, I'm not bringing her to anything that says no dogs allowed. She can take pictures with me another time....like she cares that I graduated üòÇ. That's pretty selfish of your bf OP
Oh my god! I saw this dog! You said this was UNH? My cousin graduated from UNH so I was there and I think I saw your boyfriend and the floofer sitting by a walkway away from the field.
What a bunch of selfish assholes not following the rules. Leave your damn dog at home. 
I mean, you could have left your dog at home as the school requested, then taken the same photo when you got back from graduation.
fuck all those people that were allergic to dogs.. am i right!? its ALL about you.
I don't get it.  Why not socialize with other people rather than trying to make your dog a conversation starter and center of attention. 
shitty thing to do, OP.  cool dog, but shitty person

I love dogs but taking your non-service dog to a ‚Äúno pets‚Äù event is selfish and entitled. 
My girlfriend has a severe anaphylactic reaction to dogs. She would have hated this
Did you consider that dogs don‚Äôt belong at graduations?  
I‚Äôm sure you love your Floofer but not everyone loves your Floofer as much as you do.  
Please leave your dogs at home.   
Please don‚Äôt bring them to the beach, the fireworks show or any other public place.
Thank you!
I'm officially old I guess - if they had to sneak the dog in then that means it's against the rules, which in this case is to stop people from bringing their pets to a common public area with many people (some of which may not like or desire to be around your dog, any dog). 

If everyone disobeyed this particular rule I'm fairly certain drama world unfold. 

Again with the self-entitlement; get over it. I'm sick of seeing dogs that are not properly trained to be in crowds/large mixed groups of people yet it makes you feel better sunshine, well bully for you and fuck the rest of us if we don't like it, right?! 

And fwiw-I do like dogs (most animals in fact), I am shacked up with 3 cats (my 3 mongols, yes, you know the horde I speak of)) and if I didn't have a travel job (and the Satan worshipping felines) i would give a home to two dogs in need of a family but come on, leave your dog at home if that's what's being asked; unless it is a legitimate reason to need the services of said canine.  
There's a reason why dogs aren't allowed at the graduation. Why do you think you have the right to break the rules just because you want Reddit karma? And your dog doesn't know or care about graduation. Leave it at home next time. Pretty selfish. 
Fucking assholes and their fucking dogs. 
Reality - selfish person ignores rules of school because she thinks she‚Äôs so special.  
"I'm special and rules do not apply to me."
Oh my lord that second picture is everything. 

"through a 30 minute trail" is an odd way to say it.
Marry
english major i take it?
I love the cap. Did you add those flowers? 
[deleted]
The picture is adorable and the dog is super cute, but sometimes; there's a very good reason pets aren't allowed to attend school events. And it's the same reason when I was a photographer shooting events for children/kids that anything involving pets was done on the very last day of shooting...
 
Some people are severely allergic to animals, and for really young or really old people who are... it can be life threatening.
 
People may love their pets (as I love and adore my cat), but those pets, even on their best behaviour can put people in the hospital just by being there and getting too close to someone who has a severe allergy to them.
the 30 minute trail was fucking nothing for the dog
I love when I think I‚Äôm in a dog free zone due to my allergies/fears/any number of reasons, and someone is entitled enough to think that just because they like their dog, everyone else must too! 
You don‚Äôt need to bring your dog everywhere with you. Not everyone else feels the same way about having your dog there as you do. 
thats really weird.... people are getting way too close to animals today
I'm sorry but isn't this super selfish? For what? Your dog doesn't know. You don't need your dog there. I love dogs. Im a dog owner. But I'm not going to sneak my dog into places because what I want is more important.
Resting Huskey Face
between the fabric of that cap and gown and the way huskies shed i can conclude that outfit will never be clean again... 

.. totally worth it though :) congrats!
Congrats on raising an amazing dog! Oh and the whole graduation thing too
If I stepped in your ugly dogs shit at my graduation I'd be pretty fucking pissed
[removed]
This is pretty unfair on everyone else. Although it made your day - you could‚Äôve just done it at home. I‚Äôd be pretty annoyed if someone brought their dog to my graduation. 

Pretty inconsiderate OP. 
My favorite type of contraband.
Serious question - how do I go about training my 3yr old rescue to be picked up like the cute baby she totally isn't but I think she is? 
[removed]
ITT: A lot of people who are insistent that "rules are rules and you are a terrible person for breaking them", who probably also drank before the legal age, jaywalk, watch pirated TV shows, etc etc.

You don't have to be a perfect person before you're allowed to offer some constructive criticism, but everyone here is being so condescending and self-righteous about it, and acting like she shot someone. I wish people would be more proportionate in their responses, the same way they would want people to talk to them if they did something that seemed harmless enough, but was against the rules and maybe upsetting to some people in ways they didn't realize. 
Holy shit, I have never seen this kind of vitriol for dogs. Its just neat to see people freak out over the stupidest shit. This dog wasn't attacking or even going near people. OP had the dog further away from the actual event and people are responding to this post like she intentionally walked up to her graduation ceremony; as if in some solidarity protest, and intentionally wafted the dander at everyone who has allergies. The amount of "YOU ENTITLED POS OP" is just neat to see, its some sort of weird disconnect where people think that having a dog anywhere within the vicinity of someone who has an allergy or hates dogs will get irritated and that you have committed the most heinous of taboos, OP. Good on you. Let it all burn. 
Keep the dog at home but these ‚ÄúPEOPLE ARE ALLERGIC AND SCARED OF DOGS!!!‚Äù comments are hilarious to me. I doubt the dog was any closer to those people than dogs they see every day in public. I‚Äôm gonna go ahead and guess the dog wasn‚Äôt sitting in the seats in the stands or whatever. 
As someone who lives is a small-ish town, they didnt let you bring your dog to graduation?
God I love huskies.   They're the biggest derps in the world. 
I bet this dog didn't have one negative effect on one person at that graduation. I understand you can't have a bunch of dogs at a graduation. If one person wants to spend 30 extra minutes to get their dog in, fine by me. No harm no foul.

Nice. Congrats!

That's a husky, for sure. I had so many people tell me what owning a husky was like when we got one, but you have to experience it to really know. 
They look so happy! Love this 
I‚Äôm so in love with this!! 
This post delighted me. Thank you.
At first I thought she had a beautiful smile, upon closer inspection, she‚Äôs straining her whole upper body to hold up that photogenic dog. 
you two are a goofy pair! ;-)
Unrelated but you are going to be me excuse for decorating around my cap. People tell me not to do it but idc
He's a keeper.
Boyfriend is good too.

He's so floofy!

Bleh, leave your dog at home. Pets shouldn't be in public places.

"I'm happy to be here celebrating your square hat and head flowers!"
This is so awesome! You both seem like the type who will get married with your dogs at the ceremony. My wife and I did and we have no regrets!

We were told that they take away from the attention, but it was totally worth it.
awesome, you brought your dog to a place that dogs aren‚Äôt allowed. I‚Äôm sure everyone appreciated that.
I love the contrast between the absolute menace in one picture and the complete derp in the other.
It‚Äôs a dog.
Sorry, that‚Äôs weird.
Awwww I feel the love through the photo. üôåüèæ
So you want well out of you're way to be an inconsiderate asshole

A lot of these comments are so annoying. Chill the fuck out. Enjoy life
ITT: a bunch of people making a big deal about a dog being at a graduation. 
Damn, there are a lot of salty people in this thread. This wasn‚Äôt even her idea, so y‚Äôall need to cool it. I swear to God, Redditors always look for something to complain about.
I love how they always look so pissed off because of the colouring around the eyes.
That is a mighty fine floofer. Congratulations to you!
He is soooo cute:\-\)
Aw...glad she could be there.
This so sweet
Cool!!!!
And gorgeous dog.

Congrats on graduating!!!!!!
This is truly a wonderful post, one of the very best in my opinion.

Your puppy is absolutely gorgeous.

I would inquire as to the degree you to work. My guess would be that you are now an MD. or DVM.
Moon moon looks so happy
Your glasses being off kilter is fucking with me heavy... I mean, congrats 
Holy shit you have a pet wolf.
This is a weird question but that looks like it could have been my school. What state did you attend Uni in? Congrats btw!

Haters gonna hate. Bigger question, your going to keep that BF right?! He went out of his way to give you a good memory. Life is about moments not days. 
That's a good boyfriend. Cherish him. Keep him in your basement to show him how much you don't wanna lose him. 
10/10 Woofer. Would pet.
Why? Rules exist for a reason. You couldn't just follow one rule? 
The nutters at r/dogfree are crying over this picture as we speak. 
So did you think about the people who are afraid of dogs, or who are allergic? Maybe the ones who don't want their celebration disrupted by a dog? 
Why? 
That is a fancy flower crown!
Hello sweet dog! :-D
congrats!
Great!! üëèüëè for your bf
That makes my day so much better
That‚Äôs pretty much amazing. And I wish you all of the happiness in the world.
This is too wholesome
He‚Äôs a keeper. Also, so is your boyfriend.
I don't think this is legal. Someone call the police.
I love the two expressions on the dog's face. 

"Mom!  I don't look tough like this!"

"**FLARP**"
I‚Äôm so quirky I‚Äôm a jerk that can‚Äôt follow rules XD hopefully nobody was allergic to dogs
[deleted]
‚ÄúFloofer‚Äù is better than ‚Äòdoggo‚Äô and ‚Äòpupper.‚Äô Hearing grown adults talk like children is such a put-off. 
Your dog has the same look as Maui in the picture on the left and it is amazing.
He looks so derpy with all those smart people around, I love it.
I broke the rules. Tee hee! Aren't I just so cute and funny and clever and better than everyone else?
Holy crap people are being such babies in this thread. From the picture, you can clearly see they're far away from people. People need to relax and not get up in arms over a fucking picture. 
Y'all are rude as shit, let this girl be happy 
MARRY. THAT. MAN.
That is sweetest thing ever! Your boyfriend is a keeper. Your floofer is so cute!! Congratulations üéä 
this is precious and amazing. but also her username definitely deserves more recognition, its hilarious.
She's so proud!
What a handsome doggo! Glad he was able to celebrate with you and your cap is awesome. Congratulations!!
Both the dog and the boyfriend are Keepers.
I'm going to do that for my girlfriend... 
wait, don't have  one ‚òùÔ∏è üò≠ 
I honestly can‚Äôt believe I found negative comments about this post. 

Op, those pics are great, and you look super happy. I hope none of the negativity brought you down. Congrats on your day!
She serious, but she also goofy
I kind of think that's sad but maybe that's just me
Damn there‚Äôs a lot of people on here that take life way too seriously. ‚ÄòRules are rules‚Äô üò† lol. 

Don‚Äôt let people ruin your moment OP! That‚Äôs an awesome thing your bf did and will most likely be a lasting memory for you. Congrats on graduating and GL with life! 
Dog.
Who‚Äôs that hottie tottie in your arms?
I like your dog because it agrees with me on flower crowns.

Edit: granted, that is a very nice flower crown.
Its nice of you to let her wear the hat.
How did you get him down from the roof?
That dog looks like my dog
What a cute huskie
She is adorable! Congrats by the way
Nothing is cuter than a floofy pupper being held by human. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. 
I hope he was able to sneak in 2 IKEA lint rollers as well. 
Nice wolf, OP
Your boyfriend is a keeper :)
Amazing.
my mom will literally just ask my sister to stay at home on the day of my graduation
He‚Äôs a keeper!
big floof
‚ÄúOkay, now a silly one!‚Äù

So many sneauflaykes on reddit
Floofer is a darling and congratulations on the degree
Wow it‚Äôs amazing you can pick up a 65 lb dog, I‚Äôm so jealous bc I can‚Äôt pick up my husky now ):

That‚Äôs a really good boy. And your dog seems cool too. Congrats!!!!

OMG HERS PERFECT GIVE HIM ALL THE BOOPS

Your dog shows more personality in these 2 photos than most people I know! Congrats on graduating btw! 
Floofer broke in 2nd picture, does yours have a reset button too?
HAHA That is soo aawsome
Nice! Where did you graduate from?
How did you not get covered in hair?
Wait is this Colorado College? 
Considering the amount of security added to graduations for mass shooters im not happy to hear this but I am happy your floofer was boofin at the degree goofin
We did it! We graduated!
Why is this the best picture ever? Demon dog on one side. Adorable goofball on the other. I am in love.
floofer
ITT: people with dog allergies stand up for justice
So doggo and pupper wasn‚Äôt enough. Now its floofer. Please fuck awf. 
Huskies are such loving goofballs!
But why does she get to break the rules?
But why?
This is why I always keep a "service dog" vest on me at all times. I don't even own a dog. I just believe whole heartedly, that the world would be a much more interesting place if dogs show up in places they are usually barred from... like airplanes, restaurants, office buildings, and surgical theaters. 
How much does your dog weigh? First time I see someone pick up a full grown (?) Husky like this
So extra 
Your boyfriend went through the trouble of sneaking a Husky (I think) into your graduation. Marry that boy. 
OMG, MARRY THAT MAN. But like years down the road when you're good & ready.
Thank you for bringing this trail to our attention. This is a serious security issue and the trail will be permanently closed off to prevent further violations in the future.
What kinda whack ass college doesn't allow dogs at graduation?
Marry your boyfriend omggg
Why do the people in this sub always overreact about everything? 
Great security there. Good to know someone could've easily snuck a fun or two in to do some harm. 
Can I pet your dog?

Your college grounds look like my college grounds.  Went to Berea, in Kentucky, for reference.  Also, you're wearing a flower crown, and that's totally something someone from Berea would do.  So I thought, hey, maybe we went to the same college at different times.
I imagine that in the second pic there's a thought bubble of the dog thinking "Blargh I R ded. LOL"

Congrats.Cute dog.What's the dogs name?
That's an AWW on both the boyfriend and the dog
he‚Äôs a keeper (both of em) haha
Good boifriend

Weirdos
Ridiculous.
He looks like a keeper!

The dog, not your boyfriend.
I think it's borderline criminal you had to sneak in part of your family.
Why not drive the dog?
This ain't okay. What if there's people who are afraid of dogs there, and that's one huge dog. Wouldn't they be anxious around it...

OMG! He is absolutely marriage material! 

Your husky is absolutely magnificent!! 
Doggo name Incitatus perchance? (Did OP name check...)

With my dog 30 minutes isnt very far with how much he stops, sniffs, and pees.
I‚Äôve struggled through today with tears just below the surface, and this, honestly, just made me laugh out loud! What an adorable doofus your sweet floofer is...and congrats to you on graduating! I‚Äôm genuinely grateful to share in your sweet moment!‚ù§Ô∏èü§£
Me: You are cute.   
Your floofer: gives that first expression in first pic.   
Me again: I am just kidding.   
Your floofer again: me too.   
Lop this thread is in flames 

Huskies are great! Every pic is either them looking fiercely beautiful/handsome, or them with their tongue out lolling around.

She did a significant graduate 
This is everything
Y'all who are hating on the OP for having the dog there get over it. If service animals were allowed then people with allergies would be struggling anyways. The graduation was outside. Some people like myself don't have families, my dog sat with me studying for tests, my dog sat with me through the hard times in my life- you bet your ass I'd want my dog at a special event, one that through every struggle would be by my side licking my tears or cuddling with me to sleep. 

Congrats OP, you got to have your best friend there! You're lucky to be so loved by your boyfriend and dog to make the effort to get in. 
Amazing. What an adorable derp.
The dog is a part of the family and has every right to be there as well. 
R/animalsbeingderps
Best graduation photo ever!
Face goes "blawp".. Yep, textbook Husky. My boy hates being picked up though, absolutely hates it.
His thoughts... 

"had a walk... it was a good walk, got a hug... It was a good hug"
These photos are *fantastic*!
"Are you ready?"

"Get my good side" 

So precious 
Werf.
That is the BEST!
Why.
but why tho
Dog friendship goals. 

They're both so adorable I'm getting a cuteness overload.
People complaining about how a dog will distract from the graduation or how it doesn‚Äôt belong there. How about we start not allowing kids under the age of 6-7 show up as well. They don‚Äôt give a shit about your graduation and are bigger nuisances in every case.
I love them both! 
He's a keeper... Eh I guess the boyfriend is too

/r/Moonmoon can never resist making a derpy face for the camera. 
I'm glad you brought your dog! Your dog is someone who meant something important to you during your last few years at college. Other people here are trying to tear you down, badmouthing you for bringing your best friend. But who cares about them. It's the little things like this in life that count. If we always worry about pleasing others, and forget to please ourselves, then life becomes stressful. If someone is bothered by your dog, the best thing for them to do is walk away and mind their own business.
You would have gotten just as many upvotes if you titled it ‚ÄúMy floofer and I on graduation‚Äù
