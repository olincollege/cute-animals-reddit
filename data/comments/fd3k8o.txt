Such beauties, even with the mud.
They look like they had an awesome time doing whatever shenanigans were had!
I love how the first dog is a bit shy about then you pan to the second dog and hes like hell yeah this happened
I love when doggies have that floppy ear that hasn't gone up yet. It makes them that much more precious ‚ô°
Dirty Mike and the Good Bois
This is one of the cutest posts I‚Äôve seen on here by far
The puppy is like, "is this ok?"
The adult dog is like, "LOL"

Dogs are great.
Downright diabolical in the MOST adorable way possible! I love it. They‚Äôre so stinkin cute.
What kind of dog is that?!
What did I teach you about playing in the mud?!

How. You taught me how.
Is that the dad? Probably, dads are usually bad influences. 

Source: I‚Äôm a dad
Great thing about Samoyeds is they probably won‚Äôt even need a bath; the mud dries and brushes right out really easily. My own decided to wade through a very muddy, shoulder height puddle on a walk a while ago and by the evening it was all gone
Kid: Are we in trouble?

Adult: For what?
This is exactly why I got a waterproof seat cover in my SUV. My big boy loves water and LIVES for the puddles at the dog park!

First one doesn't know if it's in trouble or not and is kinda reflecting on what happened like it isn't sure if it's done something bad. Like it was kinda just going along with things. 

Second one need sunglasses and a deal with it text bar
Ngl I wasn't sure if the puppy was a dog or a cute ass pig at first.
That is one big opossum.
The big one makes this all the better!
Daddy looks really proud.
"What? I just did what I was told. Am I in trouble?"

"No, son, they just don't understand our ways."
More like the gravy didn‚Äôt fall that from the table
I like the fact that the little guy took the time to wear goggles.  Eye protection when playing in the mud is paramount and dad could probably learn a few things from his boy.
u/vredditdownloader
Well that is most certainly awww. I love seeing stuff like this
As a parent, sometimes you just gotta day to heck with it and have some fun making a mess with the kiddos.
They are both so pleased with themselves.  As they should be!
Wait til your father gets home and sees you like th-
"This is how you dog."

~Mother to son.
I thought the first one was a little pig
Let them dry and it will just fall off in a dog shaped chalk mark where it sleeps.
I never knew an aww and a lmao could happen at the same time. Because watching this, it just did with me
But you don't understand, there was a mud monster, he's gone  now.
It's alright boy they will never notice, just play it cool. - Dad dog
That's just fucking adorable.
Hello, I am the owner of these pups. I messaged you about the failure to ask for permission to use my video and also no credit was given.
shit apple doesn't fall far from the shit tree Randy.
Pupper: Am I in trouble?


Big Doggo: Heckin' worth it.
This made me smile, TYSM!
Wow! I thought it was bad when my dogs get muddy paws.
SO. MUCH. FLOOF.
Oh no...

*OHNO*
What an absolute unit
Mud mud never changes
Thought the little guy was a pig
Too too cute, the happiness just radiates off them in clumps on to the flo- oh that's just mud
Lol the reactions of both are adorable

Pup's reaction be like: Did do something wrong?
While the Parent doggo: haha good times, good times.
Puppy: Well he said it was OKAY to go in the mud and it was fun! Am I in trouble?

Doggo: We'll be fine. A little water here and there, but we always get treats. They're not heartless, just clean freaks.
My dog 2 mins after a bath lol.
Samoyeds are awesome
The best part about Samoyeds (besides being hypoallergenic) is you can just leave the mud and let it dry and it brushes out super easy. That‚Äôs how their coats stay so white.
Now, everyone in bed!
I was expecting a muddy pig lol but having his Mama/Papa as muddy made me chuckle.
I am so sorry, but they are so cute





I'm sorry because of the grooming bill btw
...so there was this puddle
There is exactly the same saying in germany: Der Apfel f√§llt nicht weit vom Stamm.
‚ÄúFirst time‚Äù?
Wow those are some dirty apples
Pup: oh uhm excuse me. I... yes I am a tad dirty. I hope that is okay.

Doggo: yep they‚Äôre dirty alright. Dirty as hell. Hey uhh, let me know when it‚Äôs dinner time okay?
So cuuute
what breed?
Yeah, second dogs like " Just own it!"
/u/vredditdownloader
100% thought that was a pig at first..
I thought that little guy was a pig for a second
This is great, would like to see a whole pack of them!

Samoyeds are some of the sweetest dogs <3
Oh my god! The ears on the puppy!!!
What breed is this
what breed?
You did good, son.
10/10 would be happily trampled by these good boi's
Puppy: Uh oh owner has a phone out did I do something bad father?
Dog: Oh no, you‚Äôre fine I do this all the time
What the hell happened here
Who cares it‚Äôs to ADORABLE
The apple fell into the mud.
Look at that rat
‚ÄúI learned it from you! I learned it by watching you!‚Äù
Mom sitting down like "maaaannn, that was a good mudroll"
Were they wearing eye protection in the mud? They both have white swathes around their eyes. They are also adorable!
What kind of doggos are these? Chow chow?
Mud Boissss.
Oh my!  They sure are cute though!
Lol what a mess.  But well worth it
Ok I still want to hug both of them
Apparently it rolls.
"but he did it too!"
The parent dog has such a happy satisfied dog look.  Good bois all around!
Me and my kids!
Oh my where were they
Mud good for you.
Oh my! Too cute! Hot mess.
My dogs use to do this out in the Bay.. peee yuuu.. I would take them to the car wash and blast them with the hose..
I've watched this so many times... they are the sweetest!
No regrets whatsoever!
#FWOOOSH
20/10 good boys
I can tell fun was had!
I am thinking they were both investigating the same muddy pond.
I need to know how much fun they had!?!?!?!?!
"Sup"
That's not an apple.
Dirty sammys
I thought it was a koala.
Just a couple of puppers dressing up as bears.
They are adorable!!
I find it really cool that the mud basically didn't penetrate the topmost layer of floof on either of them.
....and a great day was had by all.
Dogs like this are so beautiful/handsome. What breed is this
Lol, busted partners in crime.
I love that they're dirty, bu their undercoats are still pure snow white
Someone please clean these good boyes
I feel like this a good example of how a dog's coat protects them.
Man, I just love dogs so much.
r/bettereveryloop
uggh, they look adorable but they also look like they would run up to anyone to hug and kiss them....this would be a good way of deterring potential burlars.....no burglar is going to go near a dog that dirty for fear of getting dirty themselves.....ugg, i love dogs but the thought of this guy running up to me with all this dirt....makes me cringe...and dogs also try to give kisses.....yuck!
They‚Äôve got frosted tips
They look like they had a fun time!
This is precious
Bath timeeee
[deleted]
hey at least he only burnt the tips
For a second I thought the first dog was a koala lol

The smile...üòä
I guess that‚Äôs one way to keep your skin soft
........Toby would be proud :)
Love this. Made me smile!
They look like they had a ball.  Thanks for sharing
Like parent, like child
Large and small chocolate-dipped cream puffs.
The felt the ground shake as the second dog sat down
Oh my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
What kind of dog is that?
Omg I want them! They are so adorable!
Looks like a little boar
Dad like son
They are but mere floofs. You cannot expect a floof to resist a good mud.
Oh thank you for sharing.  This just made my day! Are they huskies?
Pup: You can‚Äôt be mad at me. My dad showed me how to play in the mud.
Thought this was live action The Last Guardian at first.
Lol so cute

Chocolate covered dogs are the most scrumptious treat out there!
Be a lot of truckers out of work, if they did.

Pup: uh...well..he did it too..
Dog: oh the kid? Yea, you know. Whatever.
Muddy buddies!!!
As a husky owner, I am sorry.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how it‚Äôs done boy.... whew I‚Äôm gettin too old for this shit‚Äù
Play N.E.R.D. - Lapdance and watch this again
I legit thought that puppy was a polar bear. I miss having a Samoyed.
Love it!
I so wanted that dad dog to have a floppy right ear just like the pup.
That second dog has amazing comedic timing
Aww so cute, they rolled in shit again and now I have to clean my useless pets who can't groom themselves. So cute!
i want a sammy!
This is like reversed frosted tips, The reverse guy fieri if you will. ( after his roots start to show of course.)
Puppy: Why are you pointing that phone at me? 

Dog: usually you're touching yourself when you're holding that thing.
I was hoping this was going to keep scrolling until we got a humungo dog.

Do for a hot second I thought that was a wolf
That little tail wag tho...what a good little doggo
confused polar bear and happy wolf

Dad: quick, show him everything‚Äôs totally cool or he‚Äôs gonna cry
The apple didn‚Äôt even roll.
This is so adorable my head hurts
Second dog: I don't know who that kid is, never saw him before in my life.

Ah shit!  Dad!?!  I think we‚Äôre fucked. Yep we are fucked   Oh gawd oh Jesus this is bad....

Nah son, we‚Äôre good. 

How do you know, they‚Äôre all looking at us funny. We never come back this dirty. 

Did they try to stop you?

Well, no

Me neither. See that metal/glass thing they‚Äôre holding?

You mean that thing that tells them what to do?  The master of shoomans?

That‚Äôs a good sign. They let us have that one.....for the gram.
Samoyeds and their mud. Honestly I will never understand
Like father like son !
Beautiful Samoyeds
Yes, I've taught you well - big dog
They had a fun day
Needed this today
 Thanks!
He was teaching the lil dude how to roll in mud. Comes over like "See, what did I tell you"
Awww this is so cute!!
I just saw that üòã
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day.
What little distance it does fall, however, ends in a mud puddle
Sooo cute
It looks like they got their tips done but in reverse
OOOOOOO......TWO ESKIMO PIES!
This is so frinking cute.
What a freakn' awesome tree it is tho!!!
I love how the bigger one looks at the little one like ‚Äútf happened to you‚Äù and looks away hahahah
I see they grow into their ears
That‚Äôs the look of satisfaction.
Cute pups, what breed?
They just went and got themselves some highlights done.
Oh my god! I want to cry. So cute.

Oh Sammies. It‚Äôs a good thing they‚Äôre actually fairly easy to clean when they get that dirty.
Thought that was a pig.
Honestly thought the first dog was a pig until you planned to the second dog.
Yeah...the little one and I had ourselves a little romp.  They had fun, totally worth it...ahh I think I'll lay right here. Good times
Dad dog came in

*winks at kid*
I just don't get how they get that mud pattern. Meaning still have white spots.  Guess I always had a black dog.
Are they Samoyeds?
Cuteness overload
Two adorable apples I say.
Zero fucks given.

Aw
Why is cold mud better than warm soapy water? Even my Chihuahua  HATES a bath with all her doggy being!
Lol the smiles just ‚Äúno regrets‚Äù
I love them!
These dogs are so fucking beautiful. Oh my god.
Don‚Äôt know what breed of dog this is but they‚Äôre beautiful

Now do a power washing porn post!
Hi
Even though they be dirty, they look like v good boys
It looked like a little hairy, little pig at first, then I saw the parent and then took a second look. Oh, yeah those two are little piggies.
Second dog: Totally worth it.
Baby polar bears!!!
Puppy: I'm not so sure about this. Are we gonna get in trouble? Mom: Nah, it's fine. I do this all the time!
Hey! Clean versions of the dogs at my work.
Had a heart attack thinking the flooring was carpet
Someone is a bad influence on the little pupper
I like the way the second dog own it
I thought the pup was a little bear!
puppy: uh dad the All Father is looking at me I don't know if we should've-
big dog: heh heh
It looks like the shader i installed glitched out
I don‚Äôt see an apple
Are these Samoyeds?

Big dog: I ain't sorry totally worth it
Love the brunette highlights!
Those stuck-in-ocean-oil birds look different
Oh gosh. They‚Äôre adorable.
So cute
Watching them play with hose water while getting hosed down would probably be the most satisfying thing ever.
This is just so cute..
Why didn't you wipe them off before they got in the house. that looks like a lot to clean up
Man every time I watch it, the satisfaction on the dog's face and its contrast to the shyness of the puppy just makes me laugh
Reverse frosted tips

I‚Äôd just spray them down with a hose at that point

M.U.D. ...pud...dle? I didnt see no mub duddle. Best thing about samoydes... it will all wick off when they dry and brush quickly.

So fricken cute
Lol....I loved the post !!
Baby looks like a possum
I love the way the big one sits down.
I like how the French idiom is perfectly appropriate here.
Literally : ‚Äúdogs don‚Äôt breed cats‚Äù.
That's the Poppet family, I think.
If it‚Äôs hot where you live they might be getting in the mud to help stay cool, that‚Äôs a lot of fur.
this is great. my Samoyed as a puppy was also very shy about getting dirty and getting her paws wet. well it's been like 3 months and she's really opened up and will just roll in wet grass for a solid 10 minutes if you let her and then just waltz into the house. but she's happy so I'm happy
