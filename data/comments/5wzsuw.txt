As a teacher, I can clearly tell that one has ears that stick out much farther.

"Listen, shave your head so the teacher can't tell us apart" 

"But our skin is differ--"

"She has glasses, I think she can't see color"

Edit: Those saying children do not see different skin color; http://www.academia.edu/3094721/Children_Are_Not_Colorblind_How_Young_Children_Learn_Race
This is pretty cool, although I've worked with preschoolers for quite a long time and they are well aware of how they look different from each other. Not in a racist kind of way but they do compare skin tones and eye colors and who is short and who is tall, etc. They are smarter than we give them credit for.
What are these scoundrels doing in class that requires such a maniacal scheme? Their disguises are just the start of some epic tomfoolery
When I was in preschool, my mom asked me if I noticed anything ***different*** about my best friend. I said, "yes, she's VERY short."  I'm white - olive skinned, she was Korean. Our hair, skin and eyes were the same color and we were both set apart from the blond and redheaded girls.  To me the big difference was height.
Matching smiles too.
All I can hope is the teacher played along
My mom remarried when I was about five.  My step-dad wore a cowboy hat and boots, always.  I've been told that I saw a black actor on TV who wore a cowboy hat and boots and commented that they looked exactly alike.  If only we could keep that innocence into adulthood.
I don't understand the point of this? Is this suppose to mean something?
Yanno, apart from pigment they do actually look like brothers
Kids don't care about race. They just want to have friends and have fun. Only ignorant and irrational adults hate people because of the color of their skin or the birth place of their ancestors.
Is there anything to suggest this isn't just a completely made up caption?
Does anyone else think that the boys are just friends and the caption is just twisting the story? 
Psychologist here!

Alright so in my field there used to be research going around that until puperty kids are just not very aware of their own appearance and that includes skin color. So the kid might just not be actively aware that he is white. If you'd ask him he could tell you of course, but it doesn't cross his mind spontaneously that his skin color is different. Sadly there has been no further research on this topic since research on race perception is frowned upon nowadays and the most recent paper I could find on that topic is from nineteen ninety eight when the Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
Cute kids
I mean the first problem with the plan is that the kids a Steelers fan... she probably can't even see him anyway
But one is white and one is black , not really that hard 
This is so cute.

I'm getting lost in their sitcom.
Two best friends, growing through the ages together. They've known eachother since birth, have been like brothers since. In fact their mothers went to pregnancy classes together. Now, they experience the ups and downs of life as a comical best friend duo and you can catch it tonight! At 6 pm/7 central time!! 
Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow... 
Why are you lying? 5 year olds ain't that stupid
that teacher must be dumb as hell because one kid is clearly black
Whoa, are they twins?
What are the odds that this is the context of the picture?
I'd humor them once just because
My son is of mixed race. He just believed some people had dark skin and some people have light skin. He had no idea what black and white people even were. So one day we're watching football and he says, "Dad, I didnt know Frank Gore had brown skin."  He was 8 years old and completely ignorant to race let alone racism. 😂
I'll be a sap. If this is truly the case, then those kiddos have a beautiful little friendship, so enough that they don't even equate color. Something some of these folks cracking jokes could stand to learn from. I hope my kids find friendship like this. 
But then one of them learns about 4chan...
how they expect to get away with that tho? the kid on the right lookin like a grown ass man 😂
"Sort by: Controversial"
jokes on them, their shirts are different
This picture disgusts me. I can't believe they're allowed in the same school. Who in their right mind would even be seen next to one of them?

Of course, I'm talking about Steleers fans.
The teacher must be so stunned by the innocence of children. Although she probably felt awful when they asked how she could tell the difference.
[deleted]
Fucking retarded post
...Im pretty sure she'll be able to
As a teacher you should get them mixed up on purpose, it would make their day
I want these two to grow up and be best pals forever
This.  Racism is taught.

WHY HAVEN'T YOU TAUGHT THEM RACISM YET???  ಠ_ಠ
That kid on the left has the same smile as my niece.  I call it "hostage smile."  Neither of them have *quite* figured out how to smile without that smile also saying "please don't hit me with the rubber hose again."
Sort by controversial.

Enjoy!
When you need to make a point about how cute it is when children see beyond skin color, then you know you live in a racist society.

Cute, but it won't work, obviously. They're wearing different clothes.
Wait a fuckin' minute, they have the same nose!
SO AMAZING! MY HEART'S GOING TO EXPLODE!!!!! 
Shawn and Gus look so different as kids 

In boot camp they cut our hair off so we would look alike then they put our names on our shirts so they could tell us apart.
This reminds me of when my daughter was little. One January day she came home from kindergarten and raced over to our next door neighbors house. We had been friends with them for the past 2 years and our daughters were best friends. My daughter runs up to her and proudly exclaims "Miss Patrice, did you know you're black?!?"  I immediately turned red. 

You see that was the day they learned about MLK and that there was a difference in how people look. 5 year olds don't see those kinds of differences until someone points it out. She just thought her friend had a better tan than her.  It actually broke my heart. I felt as if her innocence was lost that day. 
/r/thathappened
I'm gonna guess they aren't honor roll kids.
Would be cuter if you didn't try to force feed race appropriation
Fuck this post, I don't get it, what are we celebrating here? That these kids are too stupid to see an obvious difference in skin color? I agree that racism is bad, but unless these kids are blind, then they can see fucking color differences.
No. Black and white people do not look the same.

This is aww? Jesus christ social engineering is just relentless on reddit.
Did it work?
I hate to burst their bubble but... They're wearing different shirts!
Something tells me that it shouldn't be that hard.
drop a basketball. thatll help you tell them apart

YEAH TOO BAD ONE OF YOU ARE BLACK
Is it just me or are there noses really similar
You can obviously tell because of the shirt they're wearing.
One of them is black
eminem and dre have grown up a lot
To be fair, if they were the same race it would be kindof hard.
children don't belong on this sub

shitposts don't belong on this sub

shitposts with children *certainly* don't belong on this sub
Did it work?
Lenny = white

Carl = black 
They have a similar Beautiful Smile.
Shit post 
I hate when kids are on r/aww.  I come here for cats and ducklings. Cats > Kids
Honestly the dumbest idea they have ever had. They are wearing different t shirts the teacher could easily tell the two apart. 
Born to love, taught to hate. 
Teachers these days must be fucking retarded. 
I'm sure that's not what the cute photo is about, just an OP playing a gotcha joke for karma.  
Love how all the comments are trying their hardest to not be racist.
ONE IS BLACK AND ONE IS WHITE!NOBODY IS SAYING THIS!IT IS EASY TO PICK THEM OUT!
 El-p & Killer Mike in the house 
I feel like you took a picture of two kids and created a story that you thought would create conversation. 
This is a stupid title, children can tell the difference between black and white people this is just dumb 
Jokes on them. One of them is black
No they didn't.
there needs to be /r/aww for animals and /r/awww for human posts 
Aw they don't see race! Jk they probably just both got shaved heads, kids aren't stupid 
Yeah... But... One kid is black. And the other is white. Man, what a terrible person I am. 
Ones black and the other is white 
MnM and Dre?
Are they blind?
Aww man, Il never forget my best friend being this black kid named devon when we were that young and our parents were shopping at target one day and bought us the same outfit to try to trick our teachers into thinking were the same, (im white). the teacher flat out laughed the next daya nd say your not Derek your devin, your black and hes white
Those smiles look kinda bad. Kid on the left looks like he's a hostage. 
ok, if they were to realize that this trick wouldn't work due to skin color wouldn't be racism

^^^^.

it would be realizing that tan and brown are substantially different colors

^^.

which isn't really racism, since it's not being negative towards either race
Wow they're pretty dumb. How the he'll are they gonna fool anyone. They have different shirts! 
what's funny is they do look somewhat alike aside from skin color. 
Stupid kids 
Either this post is fake or the parents are abusing these children by forcing them not to have basic observational skills.
What a stupid post
well one of them is black so yeah
Probably one of the most heart warming things I've read in a while. Children are a wonderful example of how we should be: untainted. Free from the malice, hate and ideals they sadly are taught as they grow.
In first grade I knew that there was a difference between my black friend and me. Either this post is retarded or they're retarded. 
I get it! Cause one is black and one is white! Gee whiz, kids are so tolerant! We could all learn a thing or two from them!
That's some retarded kids.
Racism is taught by democrats.
I don't get it, are we denying that race and physical differences exist now?
[deleted]
this is cute, however one has a lighter skin colour and one has a darker skin colour? Why is this such a sensitive comment to make? 
The teacher better purposely mix up their names.
*♪ Ebony and Ivory...♪*
Why do black people look old when they're younger and young when they're older? 
It's Gus and Shawn 

Interesting story similar to this.

I had a friend whom my teachers, for some reason, assumed was my brother. 

This despite the fact that he is a very brown Indian and I'm simply Italian.

I have no clue how anyone could be convinced we were from the same parents.
This is life 
Does anyone else see Miley Cyrus and Samuel L Jackson?

Adorable.
Kids aren't born with prejudice, it's something someone has to teach them.  It's pictures like this that give me hope for the future.
Turk and JD!
Aren't they twins? I'm confused. 
Well, thanks. Now I want children. Thanks for ruining a life of financial security for me.
The one on the left is slightly taller! Hah! You can't fool me. 
The white one looks like he could be Kalissi's kid from GOT.
JD and Turk
Never thought twins could be best friends but ok 
This whole thread is amazing, I love Reddit
Imagine if the kid on the left turned up in black face....
Theyre not even wearing the same color shirt
There's a difference between children? Other than mine, they're all the same.
"Until the colour of a man's skin is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes - its a war."

Did it work?
The different shirts r a dead give away
This is adorable. Reminds me of my youth.
One of my friends is black and I've known him since kindergarten. He hasn't seen his dad since he was 2 and one day, while my dad was volunteering at our our school, my friend told people that my pasty white dad is actually his dad. 
Not a very perceptive kid lol
If you look closely, you can see the one on the left has a mole.
When I was in kindergarten the 6th graders would come read to us, there was a girl with no hands and she was missing part of her arms, but I didn't notice. I was in a play at the beginning of my 1st grade year and she was backstage and I asked her to tie my bows..my mom asked me who tied my bows before I went I stage and she went white...my shoes and hair bows were perfect...elbow hands did a good job.

Sometimes kids don't notice
This picture makes me sick. That poor kid has to hang out with a Steelers fan 
and a new haHAA was born
Racism isn't ingrained it is taught. 
Shaun and gus!
I hope these two boys remain friends for a very long time and grow up together. How cool would it be for them to look back at this Reddit post 20 years from now and they still hanging out with each other may be in each other's weddings.
The kid on the right is gonna get all the ladies when he grows up, I just know it. 
The black boy looks to be about 28. Possibly 32.
This is obviously fake. You clearly just used photoshop to duplicate one kid in the image.

Come back when you ACTUALLY have something r/aww worthy.


_(fnord)_
I sure as hell can tell them apart. Little Jamal just stole my hubcaps 
Jr. Biden & Jr. Obama. 
I hope they're friends for a long time.
They are so cute! They look like double trouble! That teacher better watch out. 
plot twist: the teacher was color blind
Well of course she's going to be able to tell them apart. One has on a button up shirt and one has on T shirt.  
Six hours and the thread isn't locked. I'm impressed reddit! 
they do have very similar facial features. 
This is honestly one of the most beautiful and adorable things I've seen in a long time. 
Can't help my big smile seeing these dudes!
If you pay close attention, you'll also notice that their ears are different. 
They will soon learn that one is white and the other is black 
I initially thought this was an r/funny post
Steelers fans, never the brightest of the bunch
And if he manages to tell them apart, they can complain about him being racist.
I'm sort of concernd about the education system now ... 
the kid on the left looks like Justin Beiber 
That's one evil plan !
Well one is black and the other is white. So. 
Fail! They're wearing different color shirts 
Racism is taught.
Racism is taught. 
Is their teacher color blind
They're 5. We're also living in the Netherlands where it's really not that big of a deal. 
It's like I'm seeing double
You can tell them apart because the kid on the left has a mark on the side of his head. 
childhood friendship is the best friendship..... 
Apparently they forgot to call each other the night before to coordinate outfits.  
But which is which?
She'll know something is up, those fades are a bit off
Commenting to jump down to the bottom comments, I'm interested. 

Edit: that was the worst mistake I ever made. Someone called the kid a coon...
Plot twist: one is in blackface, the other is in whiteface.
Tbh they are hard to tell apart. Same hair cut two eyes big smiles 2 ears and a nose .
ONVIOUSLY IT WONT WORK... different shirts duh
We know that you just took a picture of a kid in front of a mirror OP
I see a few differences...
Look at those grins. I bet these two are absolutely hilarious when they get together. 
This is the true future. 
But they're wearing different shirts - she'll easily be able to tell.
My brother did this thing, but double.

His best friend got "dreads in training", little braid-buds, so my brother with his blond straight hair demanded the same. We spent hours tying his straight hair into tiny *tiny* braids. Meanwhile his best friend was literally putting baby powder on his face to look like my brother. We have a photo of the moment when they met, looked at each other, laughed and hugged. They were probably six or seven at the time.

Every time I show people this photo of this, or tell people how adorable they were, I feel like a freaking racist and it makes me unhappy. I resent that, They were and still are the bestest friends I've ever seen (we grew up in houses right next to each other.) I hope one day that will stop. 
That's fucking adorable. 
That's silly! Their wearing different shirts! 
100000 upvotes holy
I really hope they don't separate when they get older. It happened to me
Their smiles are just a little bit different, boom! Figured it out.
The major toothgap gave the kid on the right away kinda.
There's still hope 
Uhhh

So did it work?
We need more of this.
Seeing this made me think of Forrest Gump

"No sir, we are not relation"
I'm gonna do everything I can to keep my kids from knowing about racial differences for as long as I possibly can.
In first grade I remember the whole class had to draw a portrait of a different student every week or so. So it's my turn and everyone has to draw a portrait of me. At the end of the day I get all the drawings and some black kids drew me black and some  white kids drew me white lol. I'm Latino.  
This reminds me when I was a kid (I'm half white half Asian with dark features) and my best friends were these two blonde haired blue eyed little girls and we would always pretend to be triplets and never understood why no one believed us. 
I guess everything's just not so black and white to them.
To those two kids and their playful innocence I say "aaaaaw", to the hypocrites pseudo leftards of reddit, virtue signaling like it's a competition I say fuck off .
one is black.
I love this so much. 
I am sure a lot of people here don't really believe that the kids can't tell the difference. But having kids in similar age range, I can attest to this. We live in a pretty ethnically mixed neighborhood in Norway and to my kids if doesn't occur to them to that they can distinguish different kids based on hair and skin color. I've had my son get into very elaborate explanation to explain which kid was which when one was ultra blonde Norwegian and the other had black hair and brown skin. Didn't occur to him that that was the easiest and most obvious difference between the two kids.

Smart... or not so smart... idk, kids IQ's is dying.
OH MY HEART. 
~white kid gets shot by cop~
Congratulations to the parents for exploiting their children. Now everyone will be able to see how wonderfully enlightened they are. 
Really? This is now the second highest upvoted post on r/aww?
I'm pretty sure the teacher would notice their shirts are different
Probably a fake story, reddit is fucking shameful now.
Absolutely LOVE THIS! 
ITT: GUYS!!! I FIGURED SOMETHING OUT!!! ONE OF THEM...IS BLACK.
Yeah, about that...

But ones black and ones white. They look different but not a bad difference, more a fact.
Adorable! 
I mean...
I can clearly tell them apart
Man that kid looks like Russell Westbrook!
They are really cute 
Are they retarded?
Maybe she's colour blind ?
This post is so stupid; even though they may not be racist, they can still see skin colour.
Um..
are they not twins?
When I was about his age. All the other kids would ask why I was black. 

Their mothers would hush them hurriedly away and never say a word to me. 

In retrospect, I'd give the first instance of something like that a hard thought and tell everyone in the room that they are indeed the same and it only means that their ancestors came from different places. It would have gone a long way. 
aren't they twins?
It's not to late to comment sweet
What adorable smiles! 
I wish everyone was as colorblind as these two kids...
If race is socially constructed, why can we tell them apart? 
These kids are idiots, at least the kid on the left is. He is obviously stupid, you can tell by his steelers shirt. They might have the same haircut, but you can't hide stupid.
Wrong place m8
It's awesome because one of them is white and the other one is black
My best friend in elementary school was mixed race: White & Thai. I'm a general Northern European mutt. Our 4th grade math/English teacher had to sit us on opposite sides of the room, or she'd call us by the other's name.
I don't get it this is just a picture of the same kid copied and pasted next to himself
Why do we pretend these days that everyone is the same? They both have different familial histories and geneological backgrounds. Why not celebrate the differences instead of acting like they are interchangeable?
I feel better about the future. I just do. 
One of them is white though
They (the kids) don't really think that. The white kids mother thought it would afford her 'brownie points' with the facebook community at large, showing how her son, as a reflection of her, lives in a post racial world -- and that she, unlike Trump supporters, is not a racist! 

Virtue signaling by captioning inane artificial, made-up statements not made by children, just to 'show' that your child is special because he does not see the anthropological construct of race? Literally only other option is that the kid suffers from tremendously debilitating mental illness or retardation. My bets on the former. Yawn.

Stop the circle jerc.
Well the skin color makes them easy to tell apart :)
I'd be fooled dawg. All i see are little kids who are living life like we all should.
[removed]
The white kid looks like he's being held up.
I believe that is Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger's son 
I don't know who's who.  

Those bright eyes and smiling faces make it hard to distinguish. 

I'm stumped. 
Kid on right looks 40. Cover up everything else with your hand and just look at his face. 
maybe if the teacher is colorblind
I can imagine them being like Shawn and Gus from Psych! :D
the kid on the right has a grown up face LMAO
Skin color aside... They do look a lot alike. 
Lil' Shawn and Gus!
Found [this](http://i.imgur.com/QWW6D.jpg) on reddit a few years ago. Always treasured it.
I see a flaw in this plan... They are wearing different shirts.
I don't think a steelers fan has any friends. 
Oh my gosh they are so adorable!!

Just want to hug them!
Ones fucking black and the other is white. It's pretty clear.
Go Steelers!
They do realise they're wearing different tops right?
"Shit shit, which one is Tyrone again?, they got me with their haircut again"
very subtle racism here
Genius! She's gonna be so puzzled!! XD 
I know this is a feel good anti-racism thread, but I'm sure these kids know that regardless of the haircut you can tell them apart. Nothing to even do with skin color, they look completely different. 
[removed]
These guys look just like tiny Sean and Gus from Psych, with their cheeky grins. Or maybe it's the Gus-like plaid shirt. 

title is a feel good lie obviously

one of them is black
EDIT*:  It's just a picture and a redditor invented a "story."
Another example that goes to show that racism/hatred is learned. 
As children, we don't see color as being a problem. But the older we get, the more it matters for some strange reason. I hope the upcoming generations wipe that type of thinking away. 
I doubt these kids are as stupid as the title of your post.
Oh wow they both look like drug dealers.  Cool idea guys. 
one of them is black and the entire joke and the joke in all the comments is to pretend to not notice that one of them is black.
[deleted]
[removed]
I think she would still be able to tell them apart because one is white and the other is black. 
Won't work because they are different colors.
Um.... I think the teacher will still be able to tell 
Kids are stupid
Give me a fucking break...... 
Ah yes, forgot that Reddit was a liberal place that pretends to enjoy any racial integration story which if you really think about it it's just fucking stupid.  
  
The kid is white, the other kid is black. No, you CAN tell them apart easily, stop fucking pretending Reddit.
Little Mike Tyson on the right
My heart just exploded. I love them.
This is the epitome of innocence! So sweet!
The innocence. 

I hate /r/aww. Get off my feed
This definitely deserves to be here! 
Give it 10 years and exposure to r/blackpeopletwitter and the well meaning boy on the right will hate his friend.
Nice try, kids.  She's going to notice the different smiles
-"Twins?"

-No sir, we're not related"
Disgusting, kid wearing a Steelers shirt. 
Except one of you is a Steelers fan...
Twins tbh. 
Wait, which one is the black one?
The plan is nearly flawless. They just need matching outfits now. 
haha too cute!
Man, identical twins are cool as fuck! :)
Nailed it. :)
Way too cute! ♡
This is beautiful on a couple of levels
Im pretty sure the teacher won't have any trouble. 

That gap in the front teeth is a dead give-away. 
The comments in this thread have done so much for my faith in humanity. Thank y'all.
Steelers kid knows what the fuck is up 
Worked on me.
This is what life should be like...childlike innocence.  
The kid on the left has bigger ears than the one on the right. I almost didn't see through your plan, you sly dogs.
I see twins...
This is so so SO CUTE. New JD and Turk everlasting friendship right here. 
Awwww

psych
How was this supposed to work?? 

They clearly have different clothes. 
Looks like a little westbrook
The twin on the left is clearly taller
Absolutely adorable!  Further proof that kids are awesome.  
I hate to break it to them but the kid on the left's teeth completely align with one another while the kid on the right has a gap in the middle of his teeth.  It's super obvious who is who 
It's a shame they're allowing normal people to go to class with steelers fans nowadays... 
you can tell them apart both are wearing different shirts
THIS IS PERFECT 
The only good Steelers fan.
The cuteness in this!!!!!
Hell I cant even tell which is which
If these were my kids, I'd be pissed they were all over reddit
Someone give that kid a Ravens shirt.
One looks like an upstanding citizen and the other is a Steelers fan
That's a nice-ass shirt on the kid on the right
The one on the right looks like a tiny 50 year old man. 
I hope they never lose that innocence
Too easy. One's not a Steelers fan, and the other's rooting for the wrong team.
The start of TGF bros
I could stare at this picture all day. 😍
Kind of irrelevant but my GF is related to that one on the left
If true, best story ever
It's a shame the trick wont work because the boy is.....tall.
Saw this on Facebook before I saw it on Reddit. Step it up!
I fucking love the perspective of children.
So sweet. Who's cutting onions in here??
they need to do that thing where they spin around in a circle so you lose track of who's who
They don't realize the height difference. Such child innocence.
As an old man I can tell you I strive to be this happy every day however the Internet and politics heave ruins this for me. Works my in retail hasn't helped either 
Any teacher could tell a stealers fan apart from anyone else
Despite recent events, the future's looking bright my friends. <3
My step dad is black and has been in our lives since my brother was about one. 

My brothers baby pictures make him look very tan/purple-ish because idk baby stuff and for the longest time he thought he was black like our dad even though he has strawberry blonde hair lol 
See, but this was essentially my mentality when I was in elementary  school. Race didn't even really become a prevalent concept until middleschool. Except Rosa parks day. We always put on a show for that. Im a light skinned, large afro person, for reference. 
aw
But their hair is different colors
Fucking brilliant. I can't tell.
Did it work?
I love this!
I could imagine the kids going "How did she know?!" lol
Next thing you know, the teacher is calling their parents for a meeting because their kids are skinheads.
Is the kid on the right Mos Def?
Well that is buddy support 
You mean twin brothers, clearly
"I don't see race"

*All is according to plan...*
But the one on the right has dimples! It will never work.
Fuck dude, it's just so adorable that they're having so much fun together and not even caring about their races.  

This is one of the few /r/aww posts that has genuinely made me feel some feels :)
But like really, they're twins right?
That's beautiful. 
Oh the innocence of childhood. So cute! 
Masters of the "Houdini" 
Those are some dumb kids if they can't tell white from black holy shit.
Love it! Reminded of me and my best friend in 2nd grade tied our shoes together so we went to the same class since I was in 1sr grade. It worked and learned a lot more or at least I think I did haha.
When we were young my brother asked why I was white and he was black. I told him it's because he drinks too much chocolate milk. We thought that was a good reason lmao
Kid on the right has a bigger gap in his front teeth. Don't give it away by smiling, guys. 
This is funny, but, these kids know their different colors, right?
They look so happy :)
They've done a bamboozle. 
These two both look like they're going to be famous.  They both have that intangible "it" thing that no one can ever explain.  
They're twins right? I can't tell them apart now that their hair is the same
One of the many reasons I absolutely love being in a profession where I am able to work with children. 
Two adorable little guys. I love it! ❤
My cousin and I used to plan to trade places when we were little...I would go live with her family and she would go live with mine. Nobody would know the difference! ...I am a white ginger and she is half black... foolproof!
Of course she can tell them apart. They're wearing different shirts
Omg I love this so much I actually got goosebumps. We all might actually make it with these two in charge!!!
Kids Rock!
As a detective, even I struggle to differentiate one from the other
I am seeing double! Double the fun? Are they chewing double mint gum?
Perfect example of the innocence of children, so sad one day this cold cold world will ruin them and al they will be left with is a collection of dank memes.
Hahaha that is so cute, the wonders of being a kid
Steelers fans are dumb
Watch the teacher just ruin it for them.

Teacher: "But your Black Deshawn, and your white Josh. I will always know."
What you mean best friends , those are twins you idiot.
For me it's sad that even in today's day and age it's news. "Hey look a black kid and a white kid are friends"! Unfortunately even in 21st century there is still such a large segregation based on race, culture, religion etc., that these kind of stories yet heartwarming, still seem extraordinary.
Poor bastard on the left is doomed for failure. The kid in the button up looks dapper
Holy shit, that kid looks 35! This is pretty adorable
For some reason black kid looks like he's 6 and 50 years old at the same time
They have different skin colors! 
Beautiful.
Might be the best thing I've ever seen......
I thought this was /r/babyanimals before seeing this
Cute
innocent.

until someone, probably a relative, teaches them how to hate.

hopefully, they'll ignore it.  if not, hopefully, they'll educate themselves to realize that it's wrong.
Troy and Abed
These twins you mean.
Do they realize that one of the kids is white?
**Hope the kids switch shirts half way through the day! That will really throw the teacher for a loop!**
When I was eight or nine years old, I had a teacher tell my best friend and I that we looked like brothers.

I'm black, he's white. Same story as this pic. We bought it hook line and sinker. You really are incredibly impressionable as a child, and in so many ways it's a good thing.
Well one of them is black and one doesn't who the black one is.  
It's adorable how stupid kids are.
Please, God. Let this be our country's future.
Plot twist the teacher is blind.
One of them will still get the blame. 
Is no one going to state the obvious?





Fine I will.  One of them has a very identifiable birthmark on his head. Sheesh I'll eat those downvotes now. 
Amateurs, need same clothes.
The teacher should definitely go along with it and call them by the wrong name a couple times or hand them each the wrong paper back or something lol that's too cute. So innocent :)
I could not love this any harder. 
I have been staring at this picture for minutes and cannot spot a difference between the 2 boys, except the shirts
Little do the children know that they're now a shitpost on reddit 
Go Steelers. 
When my son was about 5 his best friend in his class was also named Carter. I asked if it's confusing having two Carter's. He said he is "Carter S". I asked if there was a different way he would want to be differentiated, like "CJ". He suggested, based on his observation of their skin, he could be "pink Carter" and his friend could be "brown Carter". I said let's try something else. His alternative, since his friend had black hair, he could be "blacky" and him, with his very blonde hair, could be "whitey". I suggested we keep it Carter S.
My daughter goes to a kindergarten in Denver. It amazes me how she has no perception of race. Her class is almost entirely minority.  She doesn't notice or care. 

She plays with African-American kids and Muslim kids and has no idea they are different from her. It's beautiful and a reminder for me to not pass on my biases to an otherwise pure human. 
Well that obviously won't work. These little stupid idiots are in different clothes. Dummies. 
Pretending like kids aren't racist even though they're literally the most racist little shits
This is a perfect example of "not seeing colour". This hits hard with me because I feel like by deliberately calling out the differences between people we are actually causing racism. Hear me out, rambling here. If we had an oscars ceremony where majority black people won or majority white people won, I wouldn't see the difference. If an Oscars had all white people or all black people win, I wouldn't see the difference. But when you get someone purposely calling it out saying "why didn't any black people win an oscar" I get they're TRYING to make equality, but to me all they're doing is making themselves different, and thus creating racism? I honestly believe when we get to the point where EVERYONE is treated the same regardless, then racism will disappear. It's highlighting one race over another that is prolonging this. Maybe I'm naive but this is the way I think and this is what I will teach my kids - the photo above has 2 kids in it, who look the same except for their shirts.
Some people believe racism is natural.
Put kids of any color, looks, nation, language etc together, and they'll get along very fine.
Do we just get dumber when we grow up?
I liked this age a lot. It was before the parents or the parents of other classmates started reinforcing false stereotypes about "the other" and overtime made distrust and secret hatred the norm. 
They're adorable 
*only works on liberals*
I"m confused are they best friends or twins?
Can't tell the difference tbh...
How awesome children see no racial boundaries, we can definitely learn a thing or two from them.
Racism isn't natural, it's taught.
One has a darker tan. I'm not fooled. 
If I was the teacher I'd definitely play along haha.
They do know one is black right?

THEY ARE SO PURE AND INNOCENT

Well did it work or not?
Lenny and Carl
Looks like kids version of TGFBro
Hopefully Mr. Krupp was tricked.
