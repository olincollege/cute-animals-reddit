Hi Up Dog. 
I'm
Lucky guy
Aaaawwwwwwwe

It is sick that this good boi is going to be trained to hurt people. 
Id be nervous too if I knew I was about to be forced into a life of law enforcement without any choice in the matter.

These dogs end up being terrifying though

Sucks they put unwilling puppers in a dangerous field of work :-( 
So cute. To bad he’s gonna make a lot of potheads life shitty. Still cute though. 
I'd be nervous, too, if I was going to be trained to unquestioningly obey a handler who would order me into situations that were too dangerous to risk a human officer's life, like I was some sort of expendable drone or robot.
  
Seriously though, police "K9 units" are morally indefensible. 
He should be nervous. Guarantee its not his fucking choice. Poor guy.

Aww he’s hoping for a relaxing loving life but since he’s a cop doggie that means no fun in his life and no caring owners 
Poor dog in the RCMP, gonna have the worst pay and rights of any police dog in the country!

Doggo= 10/10, Officers light = 2/10. Coast is garbage. Surefire, Fenix, InForce, Nitecore, Streamlight are what you should be trusting your life to.
That dog is smuggling drugs up its bum

If the dog is looking like that, they are not going to grow up to be an effective police dog; if that's what you're using it for.
