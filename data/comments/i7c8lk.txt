r/supermodelcats That second photo is like one of those candid model photos where they’re looking over their shoulder trying to look natural.
It became the floofer that it was born to be
First picture : could eat anything 
Second picture : don't eat unless it's some expensive wet food
I got a lot of questions and speculations about Isa, and I would like to answer once and for all. I have been watching that cat for months and have no doubt she was homeless. She didn't have a chip. There are many homeless animals without a microchip in Russia (sad but true).

You can see her other photos on my page or social media. My name is Alina Esther (alinaesther), her name is Isa (aisu\_cat). Thank you!
That's really one beautiful furball. :3
this looks like it could be a meme templating
They’re some amazing Disney eyes in the photo on the right
From feral to floofy
She's so fluffy and she's got such a soft-looking face!!!
She’s lost that wild, scared look & become a strong, confident beautiful woman! ;)
I was a girl in the village doing alright, then I became a princess over night! 😍
You are such a kind person to take her in and give her the life she deserves. Kudos to you ☺️. She's beautiful btw 😍
No trust human, me angy!! >:0



*huh.. human not so bad after all, this is nice ὁωὁ*
This could easily be a meme template. Maybe instead you mirror flip the image so the left gets seen first. Then you’d maybe insert text like: “With filters, without filters” or some template like that
I could cry. Looks like my cat which died last year. Thank you for your help :)
So her eyes remind me so much of Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon. Like if Toothless is white this is him.
That’s  great!!  Now she has time to groom instead of constantly looking for food.
What an absolutely beautiful transformation of this cat both physically and her/his soul looks so much happier and healthier.
What a stunner!
Her fur looks so much healthier now. She was frail and skinny before, now she looks like she’s living her best life :) Thank you for adopting this floofy cat.
Thanks for being a good buddy.
She's majestic
She's a very lucky girl ❤️
Thank you for doing this
It's crazy how even her eyes look so much less feral in the second picture. You've done her well!!
From

**I am Queen of the streets! Leave or face my wrath as I feast on your bones, human!**

to

*Hey, ummm, yea, can I have some of that tuna, please?*
Thank you for rescuing✌
You’re an angel! And so is the cat! What a change!!!
That is one healthy coat. Good job
Well done! What a gorgeous kitty ❤
Living that princess lifestyle now
Beautiful ❤️
Thank you for rescuing her!
Its amazing to see the fear of him/her disappear in the after photo 💕
Wait what... People leave cats like this in streets?!?!
Cat settled in very nicely!
It's amazing what a year of love can do
The power of love. Thanks for helping Isa out
Looks like Duchess from the Aristocats
What a difference a year makes!!
Way too pretty and bright to be on the street. Good rescue!
that’s one hell of a glow-up! ❤️

Right pic: "Darling, I couldn't help but notice that my bowl is rather empty, be a doll and refill it"
Beautiful!! You can also see how scared she was in the first photo and the trust in her eyes in the 2nd photo. I rescued 2 cats myself and the they have both been super loyal and loving, showing me immense trust.
Wow!! You and the cat are lucky you found each other.
That's the kind of glow up we wanna see.
Wow 1 year and 30% body weight increase. Looks much healthier and happier
What a beauty. Even in stress, she is a beauty!!! Good for you helping this love get a safe home.

Transformation of a cat nip addict
Amazing what love will do ❤️

What a transformation.
Aww.You got kitty a mouse.
Refined boyyy
What a beauty!
The after pic looks memeable.
your girl before and after you get her some chicken nuggets
She’s beautiful!
Very beautiful!
She looks like a little disney princess. A very lucky gal to have crossed paths with you!
The pic on the right is hilarious, it's the most entitled-looking cat ever. "Useless human, this food dispenser is not full. Fill it now, and not with the cheap food."
Thank you for giving that sweet kitty a home.  She's purrfect!
She's so beautiful and majestic!
She’s beautiful 😍
She's just stunning!! 

Kitty knows her angle.
She is BEAUTIFUL!
Looks super soft ! I'm sure you will both be very happy together ❤
You are that cat’s angel!
Coming home to my cat yelling and screaming because he's so happy to see me, and watching him grow and be happy, makes me just love him. So I couldnt imagine seeing him suffer and go hungry like so many cats, and other animals, do because of neglect or other poor treatment. 

You are a great person for taking this cat in!
Your kitty is so beautiful! I bet she's as happy to have you as her human as you are to have her.
From Disney villain to Disney princess.
That is one fancy guy or gal.
Beautiful!!!
👏love this. Thank you
She's happy now.  Great job !!!
FLUFFY BOY
It’s like “Faces of Meth” but in reverse... and for cats.
Went from “ey guvna shine ya shoes for a quarter” to “excuse me, do I know you?”
Before and after meth
Scruff to floof.
OH MY GOSH THAT CAT IS SO BEAUTIFUL!! I’ll be living by myself for 3 years and I’ve always wanted a pet and I’m hoping to rescue a cat/dog or just volunteer at a shelter. Thanks for sharing!
Wow that’s a beautiful cat
Looks happy and healthy.
I love that beautiful tail
Looks majestic 😍
They went from "dont touch my garbage" to "give me food and let me lay on you" and I love it
She's sooo beautiful, and lucky to have found you.
Shes a beautiful lass. Good on ya for saving her, you are fucking rad!
She is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!
Such a diva
Aww, how wonderful for you both, quite a beautiful cat!
You fuckin HERO! I’m glad animal lovers exist in the world. They are our best friends.
Beautiful!
pretty kitty puffy tail committee
She looks like a Turkish angora! Does she like water?
Literally; Bright eyed and bushy tailed!
Wow!  Quite the glow up!  It’s amazing how much care and love can bring out such beauty in animals.
From Kitty Litter to Zsa Zsa Gabor
DON'TTOUCHMEEE/Is my bath ready?
What kind of cat is that? Is this a Turkish Angora? :O
Such a happy floof 🥰😘💖
what a floof
1 pic "who are you gtoh!" 2nd pic "oh hey Carl"
Omg I love this, and she’s so beautiful!
I can clearly see the love and care in the second photo this is just amazing 😍
Major glow up✨
She’s beautiful and well loved.
Goes by “Snowy”?
Pic #1: get away from me. I will claw you to no end if you touch me. 

Pic #2: pardon me, could you please refrain from touching me till my paws are done soaking. 

What a turn around.
Aww! She kind of looks like a Turkish Angora
from scruff to fluff
Camera 1: *I KEEEEEL U!!!*

Camera 2: *I am made of powdered sugar and sprinkles look how pretty I yam!*

Amazing!
I feel like my GF could do this with a SC filter.
So pretty
U sure its the zame cat?
Floofer
Your a beautiful person.
What's the kitty's name?
What a cutie
I imagine that animal is deeply in love with you.
Ooh, Duchess.
They’re the same picture
She looks like the mom cat from The Aristocats!
That's a Disney cat
Super transformation !!!!!
My current foster cat looks like the picture on the left. All thin and scraggly fur. She's going to look so pretty when she gets healthy. :)
r/supermodelcats
wish my street cats were good looking turkish angoras
You can see the confidence she has now in comparison. What a beautiful floof!
Kitty looks sooooo much healthier and happier!
Good job cat mom/dad!
You have a GORGEOUS Turkish Angora on your hands
We adopted a cat that looks very similar to what yours looks like on the right!

Edit: but ours has blue eyes
🍐 kitty
That must be Thurston's sister. Gorgeous!
Rags to riches, bitches.
So much less angry
The cat was a pest

But now they are blessed
12months in a beauty spa makes an amazing difference.

Sign me up!
I love people like you. Cato looks so healthy and cute.
Amazing how it changed. It must have been young when you rescued it due to the facial difference (well on top of being malnourished and whatnot). I love how their eyes dont show any struggle now :). 

Wish more people rescued. People would definitely purchase mr floof looking like on the right, if only more understood that change like this can be common when they are saved and put into a good home!
We have a white fluffy former street cat. She had no chip, no one claimed her after 3 weeks so I was having her and that was it. She appeared in our backyard somehow missing all the huge dogs around us and our own small one and rubbed against my partners leg. He jumped and was ready to fight off a (albeit friendly) werewolf  and saw her and was definitely surprised. You can see her in my profile if you want to look. I don't have any earlier posts but could add them i suppose. She was not as badly done by as your sweet girl but she was definitely raggedy compared to now.
Hell of a glow up!
Looks like Thurston waffles
She looks like Duchess from the Aristocats!
What an exquisite floof. You have done well
Looks like a less fluffy Thurston Waffles
Our neighborhood has been taken over by at least 10 feral cats. I reached out to the local TNR program. I spoke to the neighbor responsible for this. She seems to think she's done nothing wrong. SHe pUts fOOd oUt, wHaT mORE do WE eXPecT?!

We've worked hard all year long to gain the trust 2 of these street cats. I hope that this time next year I'll be able to post the same type of story.

You saved his/her life! You're an awesome person. We are forever grateful 🧡
Reminds me of those pictures when someone is arrested after years of meth and decides to get clean and get a job
Aww so beautiful we need more awsome humans like you ❤️👍🙏
Wow. What an amazing find! I'm happy you were able to save him/her
Wow, she looks like a princess now!
Street cat to aristocat
From Screm to Queen

From Scrawny Bonny to Fitter Kitter!
You did a good job, this puts a smile on my face
Wowzers! Even the carpet came out cleaner!
Reminds me of our rescue girl. When we found her abandoned in the hallway of the apartment building (no one would claim her either. She clearly just got kicked out) she was skinny and had a broken tooth and her coat was terrible. Now she is a stunner. It's amazing what a good home and good diet will do.
What a pretty kitty! You rock!
I never saw a princess cat until now!❤😍
That is an insane amount of awards for a picture of a cat.
Reminds me of the mama cat from The Aristocats.
She’s a beaut, Clark!
It's Toothless' girlfriend!!
I love the mirror that's clearly placed at cat level so cat can look at cat and swoon.
From “feed me muthafucka” to “feed me muthafucka”, but nicer.
Your cat looks like a Disney princess. She’s a real life Cinderella!
323 awards... holy cow
U deserve it tho! :D
Even if you never do anything else in your life (which I’m sure isn’t the reality!), your life will have been entirely worthwhile for saving this beautiful creature.  “Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.”
Looks like a Turkish Angora!!! My wife got one when she was living in Qatar, one of the coolest cats I’ve ever met. Very smart, affectionate and playful!
Looks like my Casper 😍
You’re a beautiful human who stepped tf up when an animal needed you. More people need to follow. And your bean is beautiful too. ☺️😍
You are awesome. Never forget it! Also thanks to the person that put that wonderful new cat sub. :3
I want to touch her tail, no... I need it.
She reminds me of toothless’ gf from the 3rd movie
She's sooo pretty.  <3  How can you resist snuggling her constantly?
Street cats turned house cats are me favorite. They’ve been through the struggle and now they get to relax inside living the good life laying in a sun spot.
Did you take her to the vet to get checked out? I recently had a stray come into my backyard and she hasn’t left. Thinking about keeping her but don’t know what I should do.
You had better lighting one year later?
May God bless you! We have 6 rescue/dumped cats in our family.  They are loyal and make our lives better every day! ( sitting here with a half blind cat who was dumped at a few weeks old on my lap).
is kitty friendly
What a beauty
What a beautiful kitten.
She is beautiful 😊
See you in Top
Eyes are so much more loving now 🥰
Only difference is dilated pupils haha, thank to catnip.
This is such a pretty cat!
such a gorgeous cat ❤️
You’re not you when you’re hungry.
What a princess
gollum vs smeagol
Thats not a cat thats a princess
Glow up
Her tail is majestic.
Mojo!!  That’s my cat!   ...well, from Hawaii about 22 years ago.
Beautiful kitty.
She looks like a girl that was very pretty but grew up in a bad trailer park. Still pretty, but will probably cut you if you give her any shit. She didn't work that hard to get out of there just to be dragged back.
That’s quite the glow up.
You were going to fill up my food bowl weren't you.
She is stunning!!
She looks like a floofy goddess. So majestic!
Who rescued who xD
May you have a healthy and happy life together.  ❤️
I swear I had a folder with this cat on it in grade school. She was wearing a diamond necklace and surrounded by stars lol
She looks like a Disney princess!
She's gorgeous so fluffy!🥰😍
OMG she's adorable!
This is like before on drugs after sobering up.
She shed so much your floor grew a carpet
pretty kitty
That cat belongs in a Pixar movie.
Wow beautiful animal !
Natural Born Beauty.
From stray to heyyy
Gorgeous! Is he deaf by chance? I’ve always heard white cats are deaf majority of the time
cute kitty
She’s beautiful!
So cute!!😍
They look much more majestic in the second one
Looks like a damn Pokemon!
She looks like my friend's Turkish Angora! Oh, how beautiful she is now that she's gotten all of the love you have to give. Very precious!
Freakin' glow up!
Stunning!
She looks like the Disney Princess of cats...
She is gorgeous!
Those eyesssss ❤❤❤
You lucky bastard.
God bless you!
So much love made Kitty sooo beautiful!
I always try capture strays (we have a ton here) but they are so tricky and fast! I am so impressed you caught her. She must have really trusted you!
Beautiful floofy kitty. What a difference diet and love make.
this world needs more people like you
This is prime /r/BeforeNAfterAdoption material. In fact, [someone already crossposted it](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeforeNAfterAdoption/comments/i7e1dt/_/)!
I’d never normally say this about a lady but the weight gain on her face is dramatic.
That is a beautiful cat!  So glad you saved him/her.
My flipping g 👊
How did kitty adjust? The one year difference made me tear up :( so majestic & happy.
A light fury!
Feral to FANTASTIC!
That is the most beautiful kitter Kat I have seen today
How do you clean her? I know a stray that looks like her, and she needs to be bathed.
That after pic is the cat version of a Disney princess. So cute!
The way the look in her eyes changed so much!!
She looks so much more settled and at home
Wow, her eyes!!!! You can tell her fight or flight hasn’t gone off in forever. You can see all the love - for you and her new life - in her eyes. Happy for both of you!
The ears are what impress me the most! She looks so content and relaxed now. 💗
i miss my cat she was the same as this one she died unfortunately
Beautiful bottle brush
She looks like the kind of cat that would be your best friend in elementary school and then say she doesn't know you in high school after her glow-up.
I’m a dog person. 
I’m not saying I’m not a cat person.
But I fuckin love this cat.
Don’t like cats. But this one is a beauty! Glad he found his happy home. 🙂
You're a good person!
She is beautiful 😍
 my fair lady!
Getting some big Light Fury vibes off this. She’s beautiful! Congratulations!
This looks exactly like my Ghosty who I had to put down 3 years ago. How cute and fluffy! You're a good person for helping her out :)
She looks like Aristocat, mustve landed on the street by accident. Too posh looking :) beauty
Yuki?
It's like watching a cat version of the movie  My Fair Lady or Pretty Woman-the before and after pictures.
From scruffy to plush!
The cat has a beautiful coat now & this is actually pretty awesome
That's a real glow up
She's beautiful!
Holy smokes she looks angelic
First thought was "crack kitty after rehab".... Magnificent transformation!
She reminds me of Thurston Waffles!
Falcor looking much better now.
Look at that tail!! Maximum floofer swiffer
doge cat
Angora in the wild, can't be anything else with that distinctive fur texture
Stunning!
bundled with higher res camera :)
Much floofy, I rate 10/10 (also, tbh, that cat reminds me of WhiteStorm from The book series warriors)
It's amazing to watch them gain a sense of pride about themselves when they receive a little love and care. Gorgeous animal. Way to go improving a life.
Star quality cat! Glad you rescued him or het
She has transformed into a Disney cat!
*stole someones cat that was walking around in the street
Fucking majestic.
Thank you! ♡♡♡♡
What a beautiful kitty! You can see the wildness isn't in her eyes in the second picture. She looks content. Thank you for giving her a better life.
Sheesh, look at the filter on that..amirite  orameyewrite
Beautiful cat. There was a white stray that I had been feeding outside my house for about three years and then he disappeared. I hope someone adopted him! (I couldn't because I already have five cats in the house).
Did you name it Jeffrey Epstein?
IT’S A FLUFFY CLOUD!
You can actually see how feral it was from now. Great job giving her/him love!
She's stunning. You've done a great job. kudos my friend for being a good human.
Are cat models a thing? Because this cat could be one.
😻😻😻
Awwwww
Instagram vs. reality
She's so calm and fluffy now.
Beautiful...My first thought was you need to photoshop this beauty into the Light Fury from How to Train Your Dragon.
James Bond cat :)
Why are most feral cats eyes small like that? Is it because of fear or adrenaline?
Wow, thats amazing!
Look at that beautiful, healthy coat! Well done :)
She’s beautiful and looks grateful. Thank you for rescuing her.
Welcome to the sainthood you damn God!
Might just be the picture selection, but the cat's facial expression looks way more human-like after getting adopted. o\_o
How did you get her home? First picture looks like she would scratch anyone that tried to get close.
Right: Me on December 31st 2019

What type of addiction did it have? 🤣

It's like in the movie We're Back when the Dinosaurs go from Feral back to nice and friendly.
What a gorgeous cat!
What a beautiful cat.  Gratz on adoption!
Definition of awwwwwwww
She looks so healthy!
This looks like a Turkish Angora, I had one for 6 years and they are oil producers, mine was a super greasy boy I had to get wipes for, how do you keep her so fluffy? Is it baths or a type of powder?
prekrasnyy
Ma! That cat is back! Call the cops! Bring the dogs in the house! Fuck!
She looked so scared/anxious in the first photo!!
Great job capturing both a change in appearance and demeanor. Congrats to you and the cat for finding each other!
Dang looks like she got off that stuff
New year new me
I tried rescuing a cat from around my building when it got real sick from FIP. I would'nt eat so the vet gave him atibiotics and I force fed it. It slept in my house all day but as soon as it got it strenght back it was still very cuddly and would not hurt me but wanted out... it escaped 3 times and I could'nt finish its antibiotics. Now I'm finding it when I call, it comes from the basements and I'm feeding him different antibiotics (pills). It is costing me much but I'm hoping it will recover. It follows me around but doesnt want to go inside ever again... he is an alley cat and will rather die than live inside.
You can take the cat from the streets but. . .
WOW!  What a gorgeous cat!
So gorgeous !!
What a gorgeous baby
This cat went full Toothless eyes!
So its true, all she needed was a meal
She looks just like an Angora that my boyfriend had when he was growing up. They called her Snow Chicken.
eddie?
They say your eyes dilate when you’re in love...
It has eyes like marbels
From chaos to calm - love these pics

What a beautifulstreet cat to begin with, and how much more when nice and clean and properly feed.

I can’t believe anyone would turn a blind eye to such a perfect cat, good any you for giving him/her the life it deserves.
Look at that glow up. Gorgeous fluffy baby.

Plot twist: before picture is on the right. 😿

Those eyes :o
How feral was she/is she? We adopted a cat we believe was feral. We had her for a year now and she is just now starting to show us affection.
Real life Duchess!~
cute
Wow! What a majestic looking kitty becomes 💖
She is so beautiful!!
God bless you
Even her eyes look rounder.
Looks like a completely different cat due to the eyes. Great of you to take care of the kitty 😁
Change is good
She's sooo cute!!
A Snicker's bar does wonders!
she is so beautiful
a year ago, I started feeding a stray. He wouldn't eat with me around. Now, a year later, he won't eat unless I am sitting right there with him! I can't even go to the mailbox!
Rescuing cats is so effin hard, I once tried rescuing a mother and her kittens off an open highway, and I ended up with 8 different scratches on my chest. I feel so bad that i couldn't help him.
( The mother got agitated most likely BC I touched her kitten)
The cat's gone from white to beige!

Just kidding, I'm sure it's the lighting. Nice work.
What a perfect angel baby🥰
<3
The eyes tell a story
I love how he looks like he’s gorgeous in both pics 💖😍
rescued...  or stole?
Amazing looking cat.
Thank you.
From cute to very cute
You're a hero

That cat did a toothless with its eyes
Sooo fluffy
Pretty lady
that's quite the transformation.   cat on the left looks like he had to drink from lawn sprinklers,  cat on the right probably only drinks evian water.
she's beautiful and definitely loves you. 

her expression in the second picture though: "ugh, you're still using that stupid flashy thing." 

&#x200B;

lol
Which ones is which?
Nice you are a good person

She look bougie now
It’s amazing what a difference a bit of TLC can make.
Gorgeous !

Takes a bit of time for them to come around and get used to you. All my cat's have been rescues. 

Grats !
You helped her go from a 'fuck you' kitty to an UWU kitty.
Rags to riches
ah yes, the glow up
Rlly cute :)
Wow! I wish I had a white cat like that, he/she is so pretty. So kind to rescue them like that!❤️

Beyond gorgeous
I like how they are happy in both pics.
It looks like twin sisters o.o but its the same cat
That is such a cute cat OMG
No matter what you do from here on out, you did a great thing here by saving a life.
The before picture looks like he’s begging for cat nip. The after looks like he’s kindly declining :)

I wonder
She went from don't touch me to Im your girl...
Wow I’m literally crying from looking at this. She looks so good, like a little angel!!! Thank you for rescuing her and giving her a good home!
AWWWW IT'S SO FLUFFY!!
serious question.. we found a cat on the street once and she was filled with insects. We were told she can't be cured. Is this true?
That's a nice kitty, right there.
Night and Day. Amazing what love and some food will do
What a lovely fluff ball! 😁
Bubbles would be proud! https://imgur.com/a/ECy9UYE
We have two cats and both were rescued off the streets. Well, we found one hiding under the car in our driveway years ago and the other came up on the porch on a freezing night a couple months ago looking for food or shelter from the cold. Both were tiny and starving and the newest was shivering and all bones. Both of them are now entitled assholes but they're ours. Can't imagine not having them around.
What a difference a year make, she’s beautiful! That was an amazing thing you did, just wonderful!
Who would let a beautiful cat like that stay on the streets?!
Wow, like night and day!
I love this baby 😻
Look at that baby ! You might be able to change the world but you can change someone’s world. Adopt a pet
Absolutely wonderful. Your love has done so much wonder for this beautiful cat :)

What a lucky find,  beautiful cat .  Lucky cat to find you to give it love. 🥰🍀
What do you feed your cat to get the fur to look like that? I have a grey long hair. Her fur is like fine silk but I was wondering if we could get it even more healthy.
Is that Mew
I ca t believe you dyed her yellow.
Looks like he got his soul back.
What a beautiful cat!
My cat died a couple days ago and it makes me so happy that someone is looking out for other cats.
The “Pretty Woman” of cats.
So pretty!
Pretty kitty, during the Carr fire I picked up two grey kittens that almost ended up roadkill under my truck during the evacuation. Both are doing great...  truly rescued animals(not adopted at petco) know what you did for them.
It’s the cat from A Whisker Away!
The first thing that popped in my mind was ”Gaad damn this cat could be the next Bond villain and I'd watch that movie”.
Omg this went insanely viral 🤯
Fluffy and gorgeous
You can see how healthy she became! Incredible 🤗❤️
Gorgeous
The left photo looks identical to my cat Smokey, except she has black and grey fur (hence the name, Smokey)
It took her a year to stop yelling at you?
Rescued from a crack house? What a difference must have been an exorcism in there too.
From scruff to fluff
You can see the trust in those eyes in the new pic. Beautiful!
Beautiful cat! Please pet the kitty for me!
Freak to chic
Amazing what food and water can do!
That's what happens when a person randomly saves a lost cursed princess and illuminates the curse with love and care 😍
Well done. Bravo.
Have a kitty myself didn't think I'd be a cat person turns out I'm ok with them and they like me. All is good.
shes a beautiful cat!
Good hoomon!!
Are they the same cat? The first one has green eyes while the second one has like a murky Yellow eyes.
What’s her name? She is very beautiful.
I'm a simpleton. I see a Kitty, I upvote.
Beautiful
r/bottlebrush would love this.
precious
Gorgeous transformation!  Does she hold her tail crooked to the side when she runs?
Jajajaja scary
My little girl looks just like this! Just with more color on the tail and a brown spot on her head. But same long fluffy tail and long white hair. Hardly any hair on the ears lol. Is this cat VERY vocal too? Almost for no reason
Does she have a little drinking problem? She’s starting to look jaundiced.
Vampire > Dutchess in 12 months.
This made me tear up oh my god
Girl when theyre hungry and after they eat:
Such a beautiful animal. Thank you so much.
Such a glow up 🥰🥰🥰
"who rescued whoooo!?!?!!" . youtube zoltan kasnas and his cat jessica. If i spelled his name wrong i thing you would be able to find him based off zoltan.
Even in the before photo, they were pretty nice.
Fur shows everything❤
The guy can live happy cause of you op. Just make sure you care for her well
So beautiful 😍
er ma ger she is so gorgeous! I want to pet the fluff *AND I WANT TO PET IT NOW*
What a princess!! I love hearing stories like this - thank you for saving her!
awww it looks so fluffy and cute :)
The cat is healthier now :)
Does she like pets?
Rabid boi to cute boi
Gorgeous doesn't do this beauty justice but it's the best word I've got
Your cat looks very nice good job
This looks like my Blanche! Its a long story of how I acquired her and why, but im so glad I did. It turned out she had leukemia and my aunt is a vet. So together we gave her a very comfortable last 3 months. Ill never forget the love in her eyes.
Wowowowowowowowow!
OMG her white balance changed.
We need to be rescued from warm water
Wow, it’s Yuki’s (from The Cat Returns) incarnate. Amazing.
Aw, snaggletooth!
What's happneeng
Holy shit some guy gave this argumtium
What a beautiful transformation.
Absolutely a Rags to Riches story. Stunning cat!
Hey op gud job thanku for saving the kitty...I always wonder how do you guys rescue kittens/pups from strreets n ol.....if I try to pet a stray cat/dog they run away.... how do you keep em in your home & do they won’t sneak out from there the moment you open the door?thanks in advance for the reply
What a beauty!
Bless you.
This makes me so happy
How do you even approach street cats ? They always just book it man.
Damn that mane
*floof*
Beautiful cat!
the glow up
Wow they are beautiful! Supermodel cat vibes.
How does one actually rescue an animal? I feel like it would attack me if I tried.
Woooow what an angelbaby
Such a beautiful cat!
Looks wonderfull !
They both look fine to me
WOW! My cat is white too and looks similar, almost thought it was him for a second! Looks great.
Cat glowup forsure
 This cat is so flooooffffyyy. I love it. Awesome job taking care of them.
It’s the same picture.  - Pam.  Probably
Omg she is beautiful
Wow that’s amazing 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Wow, glow up. /supermodelcats. Is she socialized?
Beautiful cat
YOO, WTF?? That cats fucking sexy, bruh.
The cat on the right looks like it's trying to figure out why the one on the left is so angry
That is a shitload of awards.
It's be a shame when people be throwin away a perfectly good white cat like that.
Wow! Gorgeous! The cat I found under my back porch in the middle of a nasty Minnesota winter looks the same, just bigger, so I don’t have a good before and after. It does feel really good to watch her being lazy and comfy and really part of a family though, knowing she would have been on her own and probably not even made it. The important thing is that she knows she’s loved, and I can tell because she hates love and bites the shit out of me whenever I show her affection.
Gorgeous kitty!
Why does it seem like the left picture she’s more “white”
Turkish angora! I think...
Damn that is a beautiful cat.
Awwww indeed.
Beautiful!!!
Cute😔💛
Am I trippin or did the eye color change
Most beautiful cat ever 😍😍😍
Lmao one of my cats still looks like the first picture. She just doesn't know how to groom herself! And she is part Siamese so she is very tiny.
I'm actually tempted to say they're totally different cats. But that's the whole point of this post really isn't it. U literally created a new cat by rescuing it.
Crazy how her coat came in much more full after she didnt have to stress/save food. Beautiful cat
Wow. What a gorgeous kitt. 
I mean she was cute to begin with but damn. She's like an old movie star now. I'm in love with her😻
They’re so beautiful!!!!!
From killer to spiller
Does anyone want to rescue me off the streets?
Went from rat to cat in a short period of time! Kitty must be well taken care of
from a disney villain to princess!
Lol I made a bleach joke in one comment, turns out no matter how many "enters" you use, still appears in the next line of text, so that was deleted quickly
what a beautiful kitty
fluffer
Nice Argentium you got there
I love you
When you meet the enemy versus after they've been part of the team for a season
Beautiful
Turkish Angora? I rescued a black Turkish angora and his before and after pics are almost identical
Wow
They’re literally the same photo “Where’s my food bitch?” 😹 For real though, great rescue
I don’t really care for cats but nice job 👍 you saved a life.
I also rescued my cat and he I so sweet he is blonde and he was roaming in our neighborhood for like a couple months. I've had him for a year. When we got him he was bloody skinny an had barely any hair an his ear looked like it had been partly chewed off by another cat. His ear had a bunch of holes an blood marks and it was so sad
Even the before picture looks surprisingly beautiful.
Surprised you haven’t got a platinum
Glow up if I've ever seen one.
This so cute omg
Yes, I think she is Turkish Angora.
So beautiful and majestic
Reality vs Instagram.
That’s a lot of reward...
Such charm !
the tail is still fluffy after a year
From *MREOW* to meow.
The fine line between. Id hit that and out of my league
Lol its like a disney princess.
I have a stray and I’m really nervous she won’t adapt and won’t be adoptable. She’s made strides in two months but is still wary of being trapped and won’t allow you to pick her up. Did your cat have this problem? How long did it take for her to warm up?
Quite the tranformation
Wow, what a beauty!
I am thinking of owning a street cat too but i always thought I would be doing harm to the cat because it is used to the garden and living freely. Closing the cat inside of a small home did not feel right. Please people with experience explain your opinions about this. Do the cats get sad and depressed after being adopted from streets even if they are better fed and more healthy(the street cats in my neighborhood are very well fed and taken care off too btw)
Glow up.
She’s finally living the life of the beautiful process she was meant to be! 👑
The eyes tell the difference.
Cute af
She is now a queen
Absolutely STUNNING, tell this sweet baby they are BEAUTIFUL
I wish you could rescue me off the street (ಥ_ಥ)
Wow the eye difference. One on the left looks feral and the right looks cute
The prettiest kitty
Thank you sir for (1) saving her and (2) sharing the photo. She is lovely.
Lady and the Tramp
Damn what a purdy kitty
So cute. I die.
Your cat reminds me sooo much of Yuki from "The Cat Returns"!
Crack it's wack.  Sobriety is possible.

Jokes though.  

That's a beautiful cat.. and a beautiful story.
Yo I need karma don't worry the boys got me
Check. Still a cat!
God bless you! My cat is also a rescue.
A whitr Turkish Angora.
 Awww!
That’s a beautiful glow up. Gorgeous cat.
Wow good job beautiful cat
Awesome transformation!!!
Over 300 awards...perhaps I should post exclusively cat stuff.
I likes the first pic better. /r unpopularopinion
Disney *wishes* they could create a cat that beautiful😍😍😍
Very elegant,  reminds me of my princess.
What a gorgeous kitty!
I always wonder if "rescued off the street" means adopted or "i just found this cat, it probably has no owner, it is mine now"
Reverse the pictures and you have “cat faces of meth”
Snowball looks happy
The eyes became different
Wow. She is beautiful.
Beautiful Turkish angoran?
The pupils dilate when it’s more comfortable, safe & loved.
That's meth addiction in reverse. Stay in school kidz.
my cat is completly white too and i rescued him from the street. But his tail isnt that fluffy. But his face is nearly the same
damn, 280 awards in 4 hours
That's gotta be a Turkish angora
Lovely fluff
<3
What a lovely floof!

Gorgeous transformation <3
It's weird how much friendlier animals look when their pupils are a bit dilated

Beautiful kitty!
Wow.. What have you done to get her fur / pelt so awesome looking???
Aww man you're a real hero.
I have an all black one just like this that I could have taken the same kind of photo. Isn't it great how beautiful they are when they are well looked after.
I am not a cat person but this is the most beautifulest dat I've ever seen. Don't tell my kids.
How did you make the cat so floofy! I feed my cat wet food 2-3 times a day and comb his fur every other day but his fur looks more like the pic on the left. Is there something else I can do to get it more like the right pic?
Thank you for your love.
wowi, turned into a real princess!
🤍🤍
Me in a tagged photo vs a photo I upload
From Cinderella to princess...
Thank YOU for rescuing this being from a tragic life.  Love Prevails.
I actually like that "wild" Picture in some way but that scared eyes are sad
Rags to riches
