"My turn's weird." -dog
Looks like me when I‚Äôm trying to seduce my boyfriend.
Dog is like " I just showed him how to do it!"
When you try to show your SO how you like it and they just can‚Äôt hit that spot 
Awe he's trying so hard
Now I have to buy a cow. Thanks Reddit. 
Look at that big grin on his face when it's his turn to receive! Damn, what a dog! haha
Uh...what's happening? I'm just going to ignore you now.

Looks like this calf is trying to suckle on the dog's ear? I think I read that in a thread somewhere last week. 

[found it](http://i.imgur.com/TycjclT.png) 
>...claves will suck on anything remotely oblong (and attempt to eat literally anything), even if they are being adequately fed or overfed. Often they will suck on other calves' ears...

He noms my ear

But him I trusts

I has no fear

Don't kid yourself, Jimmy. If a cow ever got the chance he'd eat you and everyone you care about.

To think we kill one for food 
Weaponized cuteness

A battle of the ages
One of these animals will die of old age, and the other will be killed, to be consumed as food.  Adorable.
It‚Äôs videos like this that make me wish I didn‚Äôt like to eat meat :( 
All the meat-eaters in here, I don't know how you do it.

EDIT: I still have positive comment karma guys. We need some more down votes in here.

Tasting your food vs. your food tasting you
[removed]
One of these two will become food.
On the one hand this cow exists probably to be eaten. On the other hand if we didn‚Äôt eat cows this one probably would never exist. 


Aww cute. Lets kill the cow and eat it 
Nnnnooo, nnoo, no. My job
# CoW eAtS dOg AlIvE

That's some good asmr right there

I wouldn't encourage this behaviour too much. Dogs can get ear infections.
Beastiality!
