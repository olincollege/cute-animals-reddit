I broke when they all started chewing simultaneously at the end, like nothing had happened. Masterful comedic timing
Grass be like: Œ®
Me when I paid for my friends food
It's funny that some animals just won't react to having their food just swiped from them like that lol.

Like the other two were just thinking "Shit, I mean I guess he was hungry, what can ya do..."
You can see in the middle of the video the exact moment when he stops chewing, assesses the situation and proceeds at concocting his diabolical plan...
I love the piggies so so much.  The sweetest.
[Here's another video](https://gfycat.com/goodlankydoe)
The middle one is more like a *Gimme Pig*
Debo‚Äôd the shit out of his friends lmao
"You seem to have trouble. Let me help you with that"
Guinea PIG, indeed!
After a few moments I was sure I was tricked into watching a gif.
My mother recently bought 5 new guinea pigs. One large male, one large female, two young females, and one really young female.

What we didn't know, and what the store didn't tell us, was that the two young guinea pigs were both pregnant with two each.

And we had an old guinea pig to start with, so we're now up at 10. Quite unepic.
WHEEEK WHEEEK WHEEEK WHEEEK WHEEEK WHEEEK WHEEEK
stole yo girl, stole yo grass too
The last yank to get it out of right one‚Äôs mouth lmao
I lost it when they all start chewing in sync at the end.
He didn't wanted the other two to kiss
As someone who owns Guinea pigs, I can confirm this is indeed true.
They were all so still for so long at the beginning. Then bam! All is normal again.

So funny how the other two just paused in their eating when middle guy chomped on their food. It's like they're frozen in shock, their brain trying to process...and process...and...process...

Love it when they all start chewing at the same time.
Middle one is that guy who gets put on kiss cam and chugs his whole beer.
The one on the right gets so SAD!!!
I love how the other two just stop like "bro what the hell?"
It bugs me that the brown one is not in the middle.
i love squeak logs
Awesome video!

I remember seeing this before but don't recall this particular ending.  Savage indeed.

Your girlfriend when she says she's not hungry but she eats all of your fries.
That's the one thing I miss about having a guinea pig. Their chubby little cheeks combined with their blank, lifeless expressions.
I love how the two on the sides are like, "What the *fuck*, Frank?" and then two seconds later are like, "Eh, fuck it, I'll just chew what I've got."
I‚Äôma steal your girl and then, I‚Äôma steal yo food. Fool.

It looked like he gave a cute little kiss to the one on the left and then just snatched the hell out of the right one‚Äôs food. üòÇ
No the middle one is a fatass like everyone else here

Was hoping the middle one would back up near the end so the other two could eat til their lips met, ending in a sloppy hamster kiss. Hamsters have lips don't right?
This deserves all of Reddit‚Äôs gold.
The one on the right looks like he is going to have trust issue as for the rest of his life after he got his food stolen

One of the coolest things about guinea pigs is, unlike other pet rodents, their young are born with a full coat of hair, open eyes, and can run within 3 hours of being born.
