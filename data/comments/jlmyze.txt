A national treasure
Dog down the street does this every time fire truck goes by, fire dept is on our block. Makes me chuckle every time
Complete with sound
He looks at his ambulance half way through and is like ‚Äúoh right I‚Äôm running code better turn the siren back on‚Äù
That's kinda mean to the dogüòî
this is the best costume I've ever seen
That is very cool. Where I live when you hear ambulances you often hear coyotes howling!
My dog used to do this as well, but with full body motions added as well.
Only for fire trucks, not ambulance or PD. 
The fire fighters used to laugh every they drove by and he was doing his thing.
River seems like such a good boi!
Cheaper than a normal ambulance ride.
I hope he doesn‚Äôt have to hear that very much at all!
An awoombulance!
This Problably Isn‚Äôt True But I Like To Imagine The Dog Knows That He‚Äôs Dressed Up Like An Ambulance And Is Howling To Try And Impersonate One.
Poor fucking dog loool
Omg poor guy!  His ears ...

Very cute. I hope the sound doesn‚Äôt upset the doggo tho
As a video this is aww, but if I imagine being the neighbour, this becomes *slightly* less aww and an aww-ful, awhooo-ful lot more annoying.
Oh I bet your neighbors fucking hate you

Edit: this is for the people saying the dog is uncomfortable/in pain. He isn't, just following instincts.
Super cute but can you turn the sound off? I'm not sure he likes it :(
you know dogs do this because it hurts their ears right?
I love it but those poor neighbors... just the confusion alone.

Dogs usually do this when they think something is abnormal, wrong, or they are distressed. This isn't a very nice thing to do.

My dog only ever howled once in his life. He seemed so ashamed afterwards despite the love I gave him (it really was beautiful). I wish I could have trained him to do it. 

I miss that dog. He had an accident that left him with brain damage. Afterwards he didn't remember the commands I taught him, but he did remember the tricks. His form of begging was to run through the full gamut of tricks I had taught him, in order. Good doggo.

Hey! That Dog ambulance is from British Columbia!!!
It's only $3,000 out-of-pocket to pet him, but only if your insurance covers it.  Otherwise you'll need to call an Uber dog because you'll never financially recover from the ambulance dog.

When my dog would howl like this I thought it was her way of trying to get help or tell other dogs to help if possible or watch out of cars so not to get hurt. I miss her a lot these days.
Hey! This is my friend‚Äôs dog and costume from last year! They‚Äôre from Vancouver and she‚Äôs a nurse in ER, which helped spark the idea for this costume. The other dog (not in video) was dressed as a paramedic üòÇ
I just realized I've never seen a dog howl and walk at the same time.
This is great...but how did you miss the opportunity to call it a Pawamedic!?
 Imagine a button that people could press on his back.

I had a dog dis this, even in the middle of the night. Even when he was an old man, he‚Äôd just get up more slowly and howl. It never bothered me and always made laugh. Thanks for reminding of Bruno he wa such a good boy. Great idea,  great costume.
