The pup might be clueless but he immediately understands the "glare" he gets from the cat when it gets too rough. Gotta love how patient that cat is.
"broooooo I said geeently"


The dog is trying so hard and the cat is so tolerant of his shit. I love this so much.
That cat said: too far üòê
That's some serious patience on that cat
I'mma pet the shit out outta this cat
The cat's like "Okay, easy Lenny or I'm gonna send you to see the rabbits, got it?" 
I‚Äôm going to kiss him, and love him, and squeeze him and hug him, and call him George!
... pet... pet pet pet... pet pet pet pet pet.... PET? ... PET! PET PET PET PET! ... *PET PET PET* .. *PET! PET! PET!*

Do you want to pet the Kitty?

Yes, I want to pet the Kitty!
Ok Ted...thats enough...make him stop...TED!!TED!!...Make him stop or I take him out!!
"Just...let the human do it, dude."
That cat is reeeeeally close to not being ok with this 
How 15 year old boys handle touching their dates for the first time. 
Is there a subreddit for cats who tolerate dogs like this?? There needs to be one 
Somebody make this an animal text gif 
The cat looked at him like "Dude what the fuck are you doing??" lmaooo
That is a death-stare right there. 
At the very end the cat is  saying "Just stop, you don't know what you're doing"
Almost made it to /r/CatSlaps 
Well this is just absolutely adorable!
Why does this gif have sound? It sounds like "d'aww" by a weird male voice or something.
r/therewasanattempt to pet the cat

Cat - ‚Äúokay... oh. Okay.... ummmm... wait wait.. wait! Gently... I said gently, dog.... too much! too much!‚Äù 
He tried, just got a little too excited.
Being petted by human:

*Hmm, sooo good...*

Suddenly...

*Hey, wtf? Hey. Hey! HEY!* Looking at the dog. *Piss off, wanker!*
That‚Äôs one tolerant cat. 
Lol the dog flinched when the cat looked at them with that look
"Too much, dude. Too fucking much."
Cat: awwww this is nice, ok a little too much now, DUDE CALM YOURSELF!
It appears the video cut 5 seconds before the cat murdered the dog.

Convenient Mr.Cat.
"yesss that feels so good...oh okay, okay, uh, okay buddy, hey, ow damn! hey wtf man!!"
Cat is like ‚Äúhey idiot, that‚Äôs not how you do it!‚Äù
That is the most patient cat I have ever seen

Cats so close to the breaking point, but still taking it in <3
I like when the paw makes first contact the cat is like "uhhhhh that doesn't feel right"
He‚Äôs doing a great job
Let's give that kitty props for being so good! I love his face. At first he's like, "I could get into this."
Humans don‚Äôt deserve dogs, cats most definitely don‚Äôt deserve dogs either 
This is so flipping cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
kitty kitty kitty...do you want to pet the kitty? yes, i want to pet the kitty...
[deleted]
Let your dog pet you with their paws and see how comfy it is. I agree with the cat. That shit hurts. 
Too ruff
‚ÄúOh you like pats too huh?!....Well here you go....here you FUCKING GO!‚Äù
This cat went from ‚ÄúMmmnh...‚Äù to ‚ÄúThefuq‚Äôs wr-wrong with, you...?‚Äù
The cat: SOFT

I wanted to see the cat do a double tap on the pup.

Cat tries to be stoic at first but then it's like "Sir! Sir you are biting me!"
This cat is the Rosetta Stone of feline expressions.

‚ÄúI said pet the kitty not boop it.‚Äù
My cat loves this so much that he stopped loving me. When I try to pet him he gets up and walk away, only to meow at my dog till she gets him. She also insists on ignoring her food unless my dog eats a few bites first. (I like to think Mr.Kitty is paranoid Im trying to poison him and he would rather let the dog die of poison)
Cats like ‚Äúyeahhh boy ohhh yeaa- ow! Oww okay maybe it‚Äôs not so ba-ow ow owwwwwwwww what the fuck oww‚Äù
What a patient kitty.
The cats face

He looks like my Tommy! That's a handsome kitty right there... and patient. Cannot leave out patient. 

Also, the dog is all kinds of cute.
The cat is like dog please stop 
Human: this is how we pet the kitty. 

Dog: ooh ya. Pet the kitty, pet the kitty. SMASH THE KITTY. EAT THE KITTY!

Human: No. Be nice to the kitty. 
Wtf that cats face
That looks like a big cat. The cat has a lovely coat, too.
Gentle lennie!
Thats a big kitty
What kind of dog is that? Long legs, small dainty paws, floppy ears, long neck, semi long hair, dark muzzle....I MUST KNOW.
My dog and cat are like this! I got them together as babies so they‚Äôd be best friends. 

One day my pup learned that if she poked me with her paw, I would pet her. So she started doing it to the cat when she wanted her ears licked (they groom each other). I‚Äôm not convinced my cat understands why she‚Äôs being jabbed with a paw, but it‚Äôs cute to see dog trying to communicate with her. ‚ÄúI want love!‚Äù 
The temptation was great in this one....he struggled to just not go full basaltic in jOy!

When you don't know how to interact with your crush. 


Also the dog reminds me of Charlie from All Dogs go to Heaven.

It took me a while to realize that lady was wearing pantyhose. I‚Äôm like who‚Äôs black feet????! ü§î
I love it when you first pet a cat and they like, rise up, like they be saying "Aww Yissss!!!" To the scritches.
Kitty is 'Can you not?' 
Cat: "Mmmyes....I enjoy the pets...oH GOD WHAT IS IT DOING OW OW OW NO STOP-"
Humans are the animal that's best at petting other animals.
first pet from dog hes like "what the fuk kinda fur is this"
be gentle!
Anyone know the breed of the dog? It‚Äôs so cute üò≠
That cat is about two seconds from going full bop. 
Our pitbull runs up to our outdoor cat in the backyard and just licks him to greet him then runs away
Am I the only one who thinks that cat is huge?

It felt great until it didn't feel great.
Petting  the kitty leads to things, just saying.... 
That look she gives the camera like ‚Äúdid you just see what this fuckwad did? *Do you see what I have to put up with*?‚Äù Then he keeps going and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúfuck off, Steven. I already gave you a chance.‚Äù 
Human: look doggo, pet the kitty!

You‚Äôre playing a dangerous game there boay. 
I have a dog thats like that. She licks the kitties and sometimes pets them. The oldest cat just cleans the dog and the cycle repeats. Lol
Cat: ‚ÄúToo rough! Too rough! Too rough!‚Äù
Oh that‚Äôs funny! 
I‚Äôm ruining the 700 comments to say aww

"Can I patz the kitties, George?"
I love the cat's face.  "What the hell, that started real nice.  What's with all the crushing?"
Let me love you

No punches from the cat? I was expecting a flurry of punches
No, we don‚Äôt gnaw on our kitty
Is that dog named Lenny by chance?
She: Promise it will be gentle

Me:
Cat: Don t mess with me!
Cats all "what the keckem"
I love how the cat is SO offended. How DARE you pupper?? 
Was having a slight anxiety attack while watching this.. please don't attack the dog, don't attack the dog...
It's like when you're trying to make up with your friend after a heated argument, and you're trying a little too hard to be nice to them after they've already accepted your apology üòÖ
That is the most tolerant cat I‚Äôve ever seen, and makes me wanna a cat so that my dog will do this, and they‚Äôll get along.
Pet, scratch, same thing
Dog: did you like that ?
Cat: .......
Video ended too early. Dog may be dead.
I NEED MORE! Why do they always end :(
That dog was 1 more head rub away from getting a beat down. 
"broooooo I said geeently"
Reminds me of my childhood cat, Sammy.  Almost same look and he's tolerant of shit like that.
He's trying. The cats like "what the hell man"
That‚Äôs too much love!

This is what my sibling does to me.
He's about to pet back
"I'll pet the kitty"
"Pet, pet,... pet"
"PET that, you like that kitty?"
"What, is that a little too rough kitty?" 
My cats love rough pets. One of them loves it when I repeatedly smack his hind quarters with both hands, and the other goes nuts when I push the side of my index finger really hard on bridge of his nose.
That‚Äôs a huge cat
He's just like good,  good,  OK calm down,  calm down a bit,  I said gently.. 
That cat shot him THE look
The cat is like "Keep it up, I'm going to steal your bed later."
