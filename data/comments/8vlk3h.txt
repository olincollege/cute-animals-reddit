Every one of those runners missed the opportunity to start sprinting after tapping the power up. 
I'd be the guy who gets super hype and smacks the absolute shit out of it, not thinking about the fact that a small child's grip strength is significantly less than my own
I was wondering why this looked familiar until I saw myself running in the background 
I bet you a PhD in psychology and a couple of publications you could study the performance of runners and see a statistically significant improvement of those that "powered up". 
Thanks to all the people who cheer on during runs like this.

It seriously helps!
I love how he sticks it out further so that last guy has a chance to hit it... but he still doesn't.

I hate that guy
I need this in my life. Definitely making myself one.
That last dude was either too focused or didnt give a fuck lol 
If I was running that race and saw that sign, I like to think I'd go out of my way to tap it, but realistically I know I wouldn't think to in the moment. In that moment I wouldn't think about it's importance. Then I would rack my mind with regret and self-loathing for the rest of the day.

I feel like there's a lesson to be learned from that realization.
That smile at the end 
Good decision to be safe and wear a helmet. Never know how the power up might go. 
God, I would have been so animated once I hit it. Probably would have made the sound and all. 
Now if you're running, doing all you can to keep moving , and you hit the sign and it falls out of the kids hand, do you stop your flow to go back and help pick it up?  Or do you just keep going because he's obviously capable of picking it up himself?
Just saying, mentally late in a race like a half marathon or marathon something like this would have an ironic boost to the average racer.
ITT: People who've never run chiding a guy for being tired in a marathon. 
r/gifsthatendtoolate
Seeing this cute little guy encouraging you would actually provide a little bit of a boost.
This was in Pittsburgh! So cute. 
Not sure why everyone is hating on the last guy for not hitting the sign. If I was tired from running a marathon I wouldn‚Äôt hit it either. 
The last guy has no soul 
This looks like South Side of Pittsburgh. Fuck the world!!
Everyone is blasting the dude at the end for not tapping, but who saw the woman in purple who just bluetooth's it in from a few feet away?
Here son, hold this sign that I made so I can post it to reddit for karma
[deleted]
That is so damn cute! Fuck the guy in black who didn't tap. 
"All right son, stand here and hold this sign while I film you so I can upload it and get magic internet points."
If only the last guy had powered up he could have transformed to Usain Bolt.      
Missed opportunity.
1/2 of the race later...

>Tap here to catch a cold
EVERYONE THAT DIDNT TOUCH THE SIGN IS A BUTT
Don‚Äôt know why he‚Äôs wearing a helmet...
I‚Äôm spam clicking that power up right now. So far, I feel my power levels rising. 
[removed]
People talking shit about the guy who didn't tap the sign have never exerted physical effort in their lives 
Cutest lil guy ever üòä
I was afraid the sign might get hit into the puddle and get wet. 
i love how they tapped it lightly on purpose despite being tired to be careful to not hit it out of his hands
Spot the Sonic fan at the end refusing to tap
That last man has no soul
Oh right!  I also think I see Diesel...pretty certain this is Carson St.  
Adorbs. I wanna go power up! 
Very cute. 

Ten steps later you realize the kid soaked that mushroom in LSD. Then you‚Äôre in a race against existence. 
Dude walking really shoulda took that power up. 
‚ÄúHere, hold this sign‚Äù 
The last dude who walked didn‚Äôt need a power up. He needed an extra fuckn life...
What's with the helmet kiddo? You retarded or something? 
**Should‚Äôve been the golden mushroom, from Mario Kart.**
Had no idea New Donk City had its own marathon
It's all fun and cute at first until someone who's sick does it.

Free flu virus? Anyone? 
#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/Two_Inches_Of_Fun!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
Whats the point 
why is that kid wearing a helmet?
THE LAST MAN HOW COULD U NOT TAP TO POWER UP AFTER WITNESSING 30 PEOPLE DO IT 
...but why the helmet?
I'd tap that
That last dude in all black really should have taken the power up.
That last guy didnt take the power up even though he needed it a lot more than everyone else. He was walking.
Downvote because not a cat.
Your karma is in another castle.
[deleted]
[deleted]
That is just too cute, the internet at its best
Why is he wearing a helmet though. 
That last guy needed a power up
That little kid doesn't even know wtf a power up is.
Wow, that last guy... wtf why didn‚Äôt you tap it
This is so sweet. 
Was really hoping one bully would should up and just swat it super hard out of his hands.

I don't know why. Stuff like that is just funny to me.
*Tap here to get my parents a cool video, because I have no idea what I'm doing here.*

Queue Instagram likes. 
This might be the most wholesome thing I have ever seen
The last guy has no soul 
Fuck that guy at the end.
Nice idea. Now, I'm waiting for someone to edit the gif with a powerup move after touching the sign.
Report from /r/gaming which then may also be a repost. 
I need a power up. Who else needs a power up lol
I wouldn't tap it. I'd be so scared I'd accidentally knock it out of his hands
Was having a stressful couple of days, this restored my faith in humanity. Thanks OP.
I think that‚Äôs from the Pittsburgh Marathon, right? The crowds are usually pretty great!
I am going to be that person. Was this his idea or his parents? Still adorable tho.
Well, that's just entirely too cute.
Why do we find children cute? 
The last guy was so done with the baby's BS ü§£ü§£
Plot twist. The red paint was laced with LSD.
Wait, why is he wearing a helmet?
Plot twist: box has anthrax on it
#Now all I want to do is pick the kid up and throw him into the puddle.  at least his helmet will protect him üòà üòà 
"here son, hold this sign I made for reddit points"

"Dad my arm is getting tired"

"YOU HOLD THAT GODDAMN SIGN OR NO DINNER! IF I DON'T GET GOLD FOR THIS I'M DISOWNING YOU"
Always love when socially awkward parents force their kids to do shit to relive their own sad childhood
He changes the sign to the power star for the people in the back half of the run. 
And that's how I spread the new bird flu that will end human civilization.
"here son, hold this sign that I made that you don't even understand while I film you so I can live vicariously through you"
Millennial circleturk
‚ÄúChild holds a sign that he doesn‚Äôt understand so parents can farm karma‚Äù
The last guy is a dick
If a kid hands you a sign that says "tap to power up" with a mushroom picture on it,  you tap that motherfucking sign and power up like a man.

Straight to hell with that guy who *walked* on by.

+1 for username
How many times did he get smacked in the head before they put that helmet on him? 
I don't know why I don't find this cute. 
The guy that just walked past it is a monster
I got irrationally upset at that last guy. 
Cute :) Except the last guy....
That last guy has no soul.
Daaaaaaaaad... are you done yet? Why do I have to hold this stupid sign? You said it would only be for a minute. What even is this stupid mushroom thing?

Dad: Shut up and hold the sign Aiden, daddy's gotta get a good shot so he can post it on Reddit. Fuckin nerds are gonna eat this up. Hello karma retirement!
How many times is this going to make the front page?

Currently being posted in various forms/subreddits by:

And those were just the three that hit my front page. 


 So thankful for the people who tapped the "power-up".   Made the little one's day for him.  Felt the walker missed a good opportunity, he needed to recharge. 
I hate little kids so much.
They better watch their step, that mushroom is going to have everyone tripping later in this race. 
Has a bunch of little bags of cocaine on it
Wish I could tap it. Kinda need it since it's Monday.
I bet it helped more people than actually tapped it.
The image is laced with LSD.
Bloop Bloop Bloop
It may look cute but that sign is laced with LSD, that little kid is known for being a right shit.
I like how people are trying not to hit it so hard considering the kid's size
Should be a star not a mushroom. A for effort though.
They should have crouched down and then stood up quickly after they tapped it.  
(I‚Äôm)Powering people!
Sweet! 
We need a bunch of shell plushies so they can throw them at the other runners.
Nice!
There should be a guy with a mystery box and a taser too
They didn‚Äôt get bigger!
That's enough to brighten everyones day
This is East Carson Street in the Southside of Pittsburgh! 
Quick call USADA.

That‚Äôs the most blatant abuse of PEDs I‚Äôve ever seen.
Power up inspiration 
So Awesome
So kind
No thanks fam. I got my feather stored up there.
Too cute!
That dude just walking by really looks like he needs to power up.
The girl in purple wanted to run back 
They didnt power up because they didnt chase the mushroom
Third and fourth didn't touch, their loss I guess 
That guy in black walking really needed that power up
Oh right!  I also think I see Diesel...pretty certain this is Carson St.  
Is there a video equivalent of r/photoshopbattles on reddit?  If not we should use this clip to get one started...
All this needs is a tap activated speaker that makes the  power up sound from Mario when it gets tapped.
That last guy just wasn‚Äôt havin it
If I take the kid and the sign, I can get all the power ups I want
Last guy definitely needed a power up 
Who‚Äôs the badass? 
Got them all with the poison mushroom. 
Love it !!
Awww I was waiting for someone to crouch down a bit running up to it and then stand up straight after hitting it
help they are coming for me 66¬∞ 9' 37.8252
Noice!! *-*
this is in pittsburgh pennsylvania on the southside pittsburgh on 17th street and carson
Won the marathon. Thanks Nintendo!
paint lsd mushroom, make cute sign, observe
Why not offer a blue shell
Careful before someone calls the police because it is a no poster zone. üòÇ
Where is this country? Every runners are humorous enough to touch the power-up panel! In my country most wouldn‚Äôt do so, because they would feel small.
My nephew did this a while ago.... must have been on Pinterest 
I'd be looking for the kid with the green mushroom (as out of shape as I am, I would need a 1UP to finish the race)
It shoulda been the star, not the mushroom
He helped!
Little do they know, they all have small pox now muhaha!
Shouldn't it have been a star powerup?
I was waiting for someone to smack it outta his hands
Aww that mushroom is so cute
That last guy ghosted that kid lol.
I was hoping with this blue helmet he was going to have a blue shell and run after the first place person and fuck them up
He probably has no idea why they are touching his sign :(
In a related story, there is a plague on giants crushing tourists under their feet. More at 11.
Jokes on them. The mini mushroom makes you go around the map slower. 
S U P P O R T E R
Gets you a bananna you can throw so someone can slip..
Wholesome
Is it legal?
Man I thought one of those dudes was running in assless chaps for a minute. 
Part of me wanted someone to just smash it out of his hand and start running at light speed
A Star would have worked better
Legit waited for someone to super hit for maximum power. I forgot what / I was on 
I‚Äôm the kid in the helmet
Little do they know the sign is dipped in LSD. The power up is tripping balls
Am I a bad person for expecting somebody to smack it?
You get an upvote clause it‚Äôs Mario.
Plot twist: the dye used to paint the mushroom contains illegal doping substances that get activated  by human sweat. 
Awesome üëè 
:- )
Pittsburgh Marathon
Brain: *inserts sound effects*
Cute.
That's not the clip I want. I want the one in half mile when the tactile transmittable psychedelics kick in on those joggers. 
That kid knows what's up. He like A little super wise yoda... 
I want some shorts that say that.
1000
Haha, you got LSD!
I love how the last guy pulled his hand up super fast, like he started to regret reaching for it half way through as he realized how many sweaty/snotty hands touched it. 
This is one of the cutest things I've ever seen. Thank you. 
Look at all these runners missing a free power up! They make no sense. 
idk why but that roadwork really bothers me. like, they only relaid the asphalt in a strip right down the middle of what looks like a 2-lane road?
good
Tap and them applause for that little friend 
so every 5 of 6 people in that city knows about mario stuff.
Is it just me, or does the second to last guy go to tap the sign and then pulls his hand up in a "psyche!" kinda thing? 
This kid is awesome but I think he should have brought a star instead of a mushroom powerup!

Edit: Just realized this is the Mario Kart speedup powerup.  I was thinking just Super Mario Bros
The reason that kid is smiling? Only he knows that mushroom is covered in piss.
Grab sign, rip out mushroom, eat mushroom, pull bike out of pocket, profit.
GENERAL REPOSTI OPEN UP  

I don't feel like that kid actually has the arts and crafts skills make that sign. 

heh
We need one of these power up stations at the office 
Isn't this cheating?
Is there no one who can shop in a little Mario action?
Pretty cute!!!
Someone should have yelled "Yahoooo!" After hitting it.
The hero we need, not the hero we deserve!
So cute.
I love that kid. The sign was clever. Remember way back in the day when it was okay to have wit?
LOVE IT
when he points it out and smiles gives it more power <3 :)
This is amazing
Checkpoint : golden mushroom 
Looks like the people started to realise it wasn‚Äôt actually working, that‚Äôs why they stopped hitting it
r/sportsarefun ? Maybe. r/eyebleach definitely. :)
So wholesome
I would have stopped and gave that little boy a hug!
if he were black some one would have called the cops.
Was this Pittsburgh half/marathon? I think I saw this kid.
Pfft that last guy will never make it to level 4-7
Oh my gosh üò≠üò≠ 
Put one up with a blue shell for more of an... Interesting marathon....
I‚Äôd tap the shit out of that....no wait!  
When ya parents whore you out for karma
What's the helmet for?
That powerup works.
The guy at the end is waiting for a flower.
As a marathoner, these signs really help me out. Love the crowd support. 
There needs to be a star, and when you tap it, you get to run over people.
r/MadeMeSmile
a marathon race? cute kid!
So cute !!
username blockd
This kid getting more taps than my pick up game
They got the blue shells?
This is way to cute! This kid rocks!!! How sweet!
I love him!!

"god help me Kevin if you don't stand here holding this sign I'm gonna beat your ass." 
  
"B..but I don't wanna hold the sign."
  
"HOLD THE FUCKING SIGN KEVIN, I NEED MY KARMA!" 
This is so cute!! This just made my day!
My ovaries exploded.
This little dude would make my day!
Can he stand beside my front door before I go to work?
"Why the fuck is everyone touching my sign?!"
Why the hell is he wearing a helmet?
Fuck that guy at the end that didn't tap
This looks like South Side of Pittsburgh. Fuck the world!!
 I love kids with these kinds of signs during marathon races, they honestly encourage because it‚Äôs so endearing 
u/craig
u/greg 
Last guy just wanted to power down 
But little dude needs the star. The mushroom just makes you bigger.
This kid is so cool
The guy at the end: Fuck your power up. I wanna walk.
I‚Äôd be that guy who smacks it hard as fuck. 
omg the little shove the does at the end with the sign. 
He‚Äôs wearing a helmet because he‚Äôs aggrandize someone might do a goomba stomp on him?
Like the frame, OPs username is another story of optimism
I‚Äôve seen you OP on the front page a few times now. Giving GallowBoob a run for his money? 
There should've been a line not people going past him
Why is the kid wearing a helmet?
The sign is coated in lab quality LSD
Only 5 Nintendo fans :(
This is awesome cause i feel like "i wanna hit it for this little kid"
I need three of them.
Imagine the drama if it was a blue shell 
Is the helmet in case he gets run over?
Do people just have children now to use them to get karma?
Imagine if one guy like smacks it to the floor while running by...
Someone needs to double the size of everyone who touches it.
Imagine if someone it so hard he dropped it and it fell into the water on the side of the road. 
He wears a helmet in case someone taps it hard enough to send him flying.
S'cute.
That last guy totally ignored that kid
Note: a white kid and the post is marked 'animals' but when it's a black kid and marked animals the post is almost instantly on r/accidentalracism. Not so accidental after all. 


That's so cute !!! 
You saw that last guy not touching the sign ... he was strolling, the others were running - and you want to tell me that ain't working. 
Tag: Animals 
Hmmmm
Someone must of missed the previous power-up station.
..cute, but star power would be better.
Very cute. Why is he wearing a helmet?üòä
Beyond adorable! 
That kid is amazing.
I‚Äôm a little disappointed that there wasn‚Äôt a man at the end who came by, smacked the board clean out of the kids hand into a puddle, gave a Ric Flair ‚ÄúWOOOO!‚Äù And then sprinted off into the sunset
I was almost half expecting some asshole just sprint by and slap that as hard as he/she could.

Then I saw the subreddit and felt better.
Isn‚Äôt that drugs?
The guy who walks as close as possible to the sign without touching it is living a lie.
Everybody knows the mushroom doesn't make you go faster. Should have used starman power up, instead.
This is the best thing. I wonder what percent of people understood the reference lol
Is this Southside in Pittsburgh, PA?
I‚Äôm amazed this is a top post 
That‚Äôs cute. 
FeelsGoodMan
In a way this probably did "power up" some runners. I've done 5ks before and it's always a boost to see people with signs encouraging everyone.
Very nice
Why didn't anyone of them think of hitting the board in Crouch position then standing up straight?
I'm placed 512th and with this power up bullet bill, I'll make it to the top 8!
r/FRC irl
Bunch of lazy fucks not even trying 
The guy at the end must have already been powered up
Who are all these people skipping the power up!! Fools. 
Who left these onions here?!?
It should of been the star but the mushroom works too it's too cute to argue about which one fits
That guy at the end is koopa, hope get stomped on lol üòù 
[deleted]
What was wrong with the last guy??? Was he just miserable SOB???
No one cares about children. This is a place for animals being cute.
The dude who walked past at the end and didn‚Äôt tap.... rude
ARGU THAT GUY AT THE END RUINED MY DAY
The last guy is what‚Äôs wrong with America.
Last motherfucker too proud to tap it huh
Fuck the last dude that just walked by. 
The last guy who walkes right past it needed it the most even the kid knew, he even raised more for him. Too frickin cute
[This guy](https://imgur.com/gallery/RlQA3rt) needs an ass kicking. 
Fuck the guy wearing black 
That dude the end looked like he really could‚Äôve used a power up. 
If you don‚Äôt tap the sign you‚Äôre just a bad person
The guy at the end that just walks by him. Yeah, fuck that guyüò≠
I like how at the last guy who walked by, the kid thrust it at him like YOU NEED IT
Dude that just walked by is in desperate need of a power up
Who are these monsters that don‚Äôt hit it?
Fuck that last guy
THAT LAST GUY BROKE MY HEART THANKS
That last asshole though...
That last guy refusing a power up was most unwise!
That guy in black walking by towards the end is clearly a giant dick bag. 
What kind of evil person doesn‚Äôt hit a mario mushroom sign especially one held by a cute kid?? Also that guy needed the power up more than the rest 
who's the asshole who didn't tap it
Aww this is too cute. Fuck the last guy who ignored the kid‚Äôs kind stretch... who wouldn‚Äôt!?
Fuck the guy who denied the power up 
That last guy that just walked by was such an asshole
That last guy that didn't tap the sign sucks.  I can already tell he's an asshole lol.
To the guy who walked by after he put it out farther for at the end, fuuuuuck you üòÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This kid is goin places
Didn't power up.  The Sewer pipe plant got him.
any chance this was Chicago?!
How cute. Also why is there a animal flair? 
Clickbait is getting more and more sophisticated
Power Upvote! üòÇüòè
r/wholesomegifs
That last guy needed a power up. I wonder if he read the sign...
gotta go fast
Little do they know, that mushroom is painted with liquid LSD
Not sure what bothers me more, that last guy not tapping the sign or that kid‚Äôs helmet.
Saw one asshole
What happens when he pulls out the fire flower? O_o
This is awesome
That‚Äôs awesome!
That‚Äôs adorable
Missed opportunity to use the STAR power.
That‚Äôs a mini mushroom tho
cute ü§£
Why are they scared to touch it???
Shouldn‚Äôt it be the star though?
One of those folks need a star power up 
Taking his job seriously. 
This is so adorable! I was waiting for someone to actually boost tho ahaha
Dude walking needed to power up the most.
I think this kid might be onto something.
Need a permit for that.
Too freaking adorable! Very clever!
I was expecting Mario to run by. 
r/mademesmile
I would've been making the sound each time it was hit.
Markers... check.

Cardboard... check.

Camera... check.

A susceptible child that‚Äôll do anything you tell it and look cute while doing so?

Check.
That dick at the end... How could he just WALK right by and not tap? I'm so triggered...
That kid is awesome. What a wonderful idea!
 I would need the Bullet.
Tap
Move away from the puddle to get more taps 
Whats up Pittsburgh!
Ah I want him, this one specifically, where do I apply? 
Kept waiting for the Mario cosplayer to run by, but op did not deliver
I'd love to have that kid wake me up every morning with that sing 
And then some golden haired twat runs past, snatching the sign, all while screaming "VICTORY FOR VEGETA!"
I would've tapped that thing multiple times! "Here we- Here we- Here we go! Here we go!"
      
Little do the other runners know, there's a very special steroid that immediately works upon skin contact
Plot twist: Hes actually gathering their DNA to create clones
That last guy REALLY needed the power up.
I like the sign thrust at the end toward the man in black walking: "YOU CLEARLY NEED A POWER UP!"
Awww, that kid‚Äôs dad is so cute
And that‚Äôs why that guy is walking 
That one nigga that just walk past was like fuck this im not dealing with this bs
I would just pick him up and keep running, raise him as my own. 
*Taps it fifteen times* lol
That‚Äôs cute
hey, u stole my username :(
How freaking adorable is this?! What a motivator.
pretty awesome
When I run any sort of race and someone has this sign, I make sure to acknowledge it.  They took the time to make it, it helps you get a little extra motivation, and it makes the kids day.
Spectators making running much more enjoyable
Last dude was a bonafide HARDOOO 
Parenting achievement level 10,000
gay as fuk
Who doesn‚Äôt wanna power up!? 
Plot twist,  the mushroom is laced with acid...
Plot twist: there was fentanyl on the mushroom. 
I'd have been that guy that would probably be squatting on my way to the sign upon seeing it, tap it, spring up and start sprinting for the next 5 feet and then probably pass out.
Last dude didn't touch it. Still only walking
That‚Äôs the cutest fuckig thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Fuck that guy in the black at the end.
Why is it under animals?
I wonder if the guy who just walked right by was feeling  mocked. 
Hands down, best self employed sign holder in the world. *Dirty kid salute*

EDIT: The agressive, "Hit the f(+&in button" is priceless.
I came here expecting reddit to tear that last guy a new one for not hitting the power up. 
I feel like this would be used as a prompt for r/writingprompts where you wake to find that you have Mario's superpowers after touching this kid's sign.
Awesome!
That is too cute!
Would of been nice to see someone tap the sign then jump with a fist in the air
That last guy REALLY needed a power up :/
clearly one his parents made the poster for him, told him to hold it, and then recorded it
I absolutely would have gotten too excited and slapped the sign into that puddle
The guy in the end didn‚Äôt power up.. 
That guy in black at the end that just strolled right!  I would put money with no other evidence than this that he is horrible miserable human being.......



........Unless he‚Äôs blind üòé.....then I am üò≥
didn‚Äôt tap=ded inside
Hey fuck that last guy
*quickly flips board*

**Tap for blue shell** 

*Someone taps it, kid starts running as fast as he can to catch up with the race*

*Find person in first place*

*Starts beating them unconsious with the sign*


Poor kid. I hope they taught him that rejection isn‚Äôt a judgment on who he is. 
Tap here to give my dad karma*
Fuck that guy at the end tho.
The one who needed it most didn't take it. SMH
That‚Äôs so creative this kid must have felt so good about himself
I love things like this in a marathon. Some of them are really funny that help you forget the pain temporarily. I saw one like this but it used a star instead, we passed by twice and each time I would sing the song that plays when you get the star. These small things go a long way to help make these events enjoyable!
It‚Äôs beautiful shit like this that really makes me love the internet
So why the bike helmet?
He probably thinks he‚Äôs genuinely helping people power up, so cute! 
last guy that was walking should have tapped it and started running
Ayooo that‚Äôs me tapping the sign, gave me new life. 
Skip the mushroom, looking for Speed Shoes box... and a few gold rings.
Why is he wearing a helmet?
The kid probably put booger all over the board
Fake News. This kid did not make that sign. His parents forced him to stand there with a sign they made.
‚ÄúHold this while I record you, I need internet points.‚Äù
That last guy :(
That last guy :(
Someone gotta find the address of the last dude in black, I just wanna have a chat 
What heartless prick doesn‚Äôt tap that sign? 
That is one it the reasons I have kids. Its moments like this when you realize how truly special they can be. Little thing like this makes a kid soooo happy. They cherish that for a long time.

Hold on to these moments and take everyone you can get. 
Screw that guy at the end.
I hate this brat
That one guy who goes by at the end - what a groucho ;-P
I am unreasonably mad at that last guy.
The last guy is an asshole.

That last guy was a real piece of shit.
Aww jerko in the black at the end. Little bean so sweet!!
This is how diseases are spread. Of course it's a snot nosed young punk who starts it.
So cute! I can't wait to have kids... probably should finish school first tho ;)
Fuck that last guy tho. Psh.... Needed it the most.
Last guy was Dave. Screw toy Dave!!!
That last guy was a straight wanker. Tap the cardboard 
I instantly started hating anyone who just walked past that without tapping it. 
1. Beginning of video I thought the guy with the pinkish towel had his ass showing
2. WHY DIDN'T THAT LAST JERK HIT THE SIGN... POOR LITTLE GUY STICKS THE SIGN OUT AFTER THAT :(

EDIT: I called him a jerk but I am not saying he is evil guys..calm down
Fuck that guy who walked right by and didn't tap the sign.
Am I the only asshole that would slap that shit out of the kid's hands and straight into the puddle?
[removed]
Bless this child. There is hope in the world! <3
Fortnite
This is so cute!
That boy is so adorable!
Hahaha I was waiting for some tired bastard to accidentally slap the sign out of the kid's hand 
Was this during the Philadelphia Marathon? I swear I saw this kid up by Fairmount Park as well
DISQUALIFIED!
Fuck, not this again. I need a blue shell 
How the f*ck do you have 1,460,000 karma, you gained 20000 karma in 5 seconds when i reloaded the page, you were 1,580,000
I was waiting for someone to slap it out of his hands lol
I was in a 5k with my daughter and someone had a sign like this... So I did a flying kick at the sign but I don't think anyone got video of it so it didn't happen, sad
You know it‚Äôs a good day when you see this on the front page 4 different times
