The dog scans for owners eye contact,  "look at me, I'm luggage "
Dogs in any situation: "I don't know what's happening but I'm excited about it and and I trust you."
I know you can't see it but you just *know* his tail is wagging **so hard**.
Even though I imagine the rule was made for the purposes of only allowing small dogs, it's still a pretty effective rule because if you have a big dog that will hang out in a bag like that, that's a well behaved dog that isn't going to be causing any problems on the subway.
To be fair he does fit
http://imgur.com/VNvjhZo my favorite one. 
[Here's my bag'o shibe](https://i.imgur.com/jq711yM.jpg) 
Is it just me or does the movement of that strap in the back line up with the smile perfectly.

Like it's the result of a tail wagging furiously in the bag. 
[My favourite.](https://i.imgur.com/IKA7BYX.jpg)
He looks so content. 
That smile at the end, it's like he's in on the plan.

"I'm doing real good. Nobody knows how good a boy I am."
It's as if it never rains or get gloomy in his mind. I wish I could be happy like a dog sometimes.
The dog just made a funny joke and only he's laughing at it. 
Mirror?

Edit: [Mirror!](https://gfycat.com/UncomfortableUltimateEuropeanfiresalamander)
He seems perfectly fine with it =P

Is that bag a TARDIS or something, because that dog looks way too big to fit in there.
So the last time I saw this there were photos of people with big dogs in large bags. One guy had his dog in a trekking backpack and it looked very uncomfortable for the dog. This got me thinking that people should just get large totes with a zipper and cut out legs for the dog with extra long handles that basically function as a leash. The dog could walk around while you're "holding" the bag. The dog is still technically in a bag so you can't get fined or whatever. 

EDIT: Also all of the faces of the bag could be mesh while the edges can be canvas or nylon straps. That way the dog stays cool while still being secure. 
Doggo doin a luggage 
My reaction to seeing this gif was to giggle and applaud like a small child and actually say "Yayyyyy". I'm a 34 year old father of two alone in my basement.
[pal, you just right my wrong](https://i.redd.it/kkem6kkq8chx.jpg)
So if I have a gigantic dog, I can just purchase/make a very large bag and have him sit inside of it, correct?
What's that, you want me to cram into this tiny bag for an hour?  
  
...  
  
AWESOME!
I have never seen a doggie bag quite like this one.
That doggo looks like he is saying "hehe, we are getting away with this!"
"Dude, I'm so fucking good."
We need a subreddit for dogs in the NY subway.
Bag full of golden happiness!
Did anyone else start laughing with the dog?
I just love this sweet baby's face!
This is why people love dogs. They just roll with life with a smile. My cat would scream, scratch and jump out of the bag and then hold the entire subway car hostage until I agreed to get in the bag instead.
That pup is like "heh heh heh we sure did them a good foolin"
I'm more impressed with how well the dog is doing stuffed in a bag. I have a German Shepard/Black Lab mix and he's so rambunctious I don't know what to do with him. 
That dog is looks like it finds the whole thing hilarious!
You can see the zipper start to vibrate when he smiles and wags his tail :)
HEY MORTY! LOOK AT ME, I TURNED MYSELF INTO A DOG! I'M DOGGO RIIIIICK!
I love how you can still see where he's wagging his tail
[removed]
You're going to have to try a lot harder than that to upset a Golden Retriever. 
Meanwhile dogs in Russia is riding the subway on their own. 
I don't usually comment on shit. I'm drunk and this dog is cute. 
/r/thisismylifenow
I get that it sucks for some dog owners with big ole puppies but at some point cramming them into a bag is an asshole move in my opinion. 
Talk about a doggy bag.
*"Hey. Yeah, I'm still in the bag. IT. IS. THE BEST!!!"*
"Why am I in the bag?" 

Thinks about it...

"It's great though!" 
He's totally wagging his tail in that bag
That's not even a law, that's a challenge.
All I can think of is if there are any bomb detecting dogs that were to sniff the luggage but really just want to sniff the dogs butt like all dogs do

Doggo looks happy but awkwardly uncomfortable at the same time? 
I have an odd feeling that he suddenly smiles because he just took fat shit in that bag
I like how you can see his tail wagging from the eyes without seeing it
He doesn't understand why he has to be in the bag, but he's glad you brought him along.
That laugh at the end though.
Bags are just hugs that take you places!
Omgggg what a goofy goober :) 
He's a cutie 
I don't know how it is now but I got on the 2 or 5 train from East New York a couple times with an adult pit bull. I took her all the way into midtown Manhattan without getting stopped or questioned by anyone. I was prepared to argue that she was a boxer\sharpey mixed mut if anyone questioned the legality of the breed. I just had a leash and made it sit between my legs and face me because a lot of people in NYC are strangely afraid of dogs. She just sat with her head in my lap.

This was summer 15 
if it fits, I sit
Is this real?
He/She's adorable with that smile!

And I feel like a golden retriever is more content than ever inside the bag, just waiting to do a full butt wag when getting out
I love him 
Or if they're service dogs, then it doesn't matter what the size is 
i can already see his tail wagging 
My city will only let you bring a dog on the subway if you can pay for his ticket
You're the luggage now, dog.
*"Who's a good ~~boy~~ bag?"*
The smile is great
Doggy bag
I like this dog's attitude. 
You can see the bag is shaking from him wagging his tail 
That's the face you make when you know you got away with something. LOL
Who's a good boy?
I love how the dog is such a good sport about the whole thing.  He doesn't know what's going on but he likes hanging out with the humans, so he's content.
(Dog to owner) 
"Nobody suspects a thing" 
Gif was deleted unfortunately. It was cute

This is the best thing on the Internet.
Normal person: Bring a smaller dog.

Dog person: Bring a bigger bag.

ITT: people who think a dog that is panting because it is overheating is smiling or laughing.
He looks like he's popping out of a toaster
Either just heard joke or farted
Heh, we bent the rules, didn't we dad?
This is so cute it's almost creepy. It's like he's human how well he knows our emotions. 
This is the best thing I've seen in a while. 
If I was that dog I would be having a panic attack due to claustrophobia.
Marketing [Nike] sure has changed!
oh..look at me. i'm in the bag.
*"Hooman, hooman.. Im dyin' here man"*
I want to see someone bring a tibetan mastiff onboard in a bag. 
Shhhh no one even knows I'm in here mum!! 
What a good boy
Thats some Scooby Doo type shit right there!
i would totally want to kiss that dog on top of its head.
Looks like The Mask's dog.
Why would they make "able to fit in a bag" the standard for dog size? That phrasing is so obviously vulnerable to loopholes
LOL I expected like a garbage bag with a dog in it. This is so much better.
NYC's rules for everything are ridiculous, I don't miss living there.
I feel like the dog is all like, "Yeah we sure showed them"
Bonsai doggo
Dog has trollface laugh. 
Does this rule apply to service animals or guide dogs 
I wish I was as content doing anything as that dog is being in a bag.
Hah! Take that statists!  
OMG....so cute❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Why the fuck would anyone own a dog other than a lapdog living in NYC!? 
Aww the strap on the luggage starts shaking. Gives their wagging away
The dog is very uncomfortable in that cramped space, very likely overheating and suffering cramps from being squished. Does this person absolutely *have* to have the dog along on the subway?
before and after he got told he was a good boy
Can anyone actually find the rule?  I'm having trouble.

I can find the definition of a service animal on the MTA site, but not anything about what type of carriers are required for non-service animals.
This is a gif that will be around 10 years from now
Expected a barking rat, was happily surprised. Have my upvote.
Lololol who opened up the dog head portal? 
W2C those sick nikes
In Chicago you can't bring them on at all 😡

But Uber's allow them so that is good :) my dogs don't like Uber though they get nervous 
If I fits, I sits! This is an adorable post 😌 I always wanted a dog for this. 
doge be like "heh heh got em" 
The grinches' small heart grew 3 times that day
He smile 
He Looks pretty squashed
"hey.  Hey Rick.  Hey Rick look at me"

"Im luggage :)"
Luggage doggo huehue cute
That is the Goodest Good Boi. Good Doggo Good.
10/10 cuteness 
Find someone who looks at you like this dog.
what a cutie patootie
You know he's wagging. You can see it. At the back of the bag, next to the wheel. 
That is clearly just a dog's head.
This is strange but we're here together
This only confirms that it is impossible for a Golden to be unhappy
Why am in bag hooman? But is fun anyway!
Dog doesn't seem to mind at all. 
Love that smile!
OMG someone pet that pooch!
This made me happier than my wedding day 
[deleted]
What If I get a really big bag? Can I get my mastiff along?
He looks surprisingly happy to be there.
Such a dumb rule
That dog is so proud of himself.
"I'm a small bag now? I love you :3"
It's a dog

For goodness sake, get the dog a bigger bag! 
The goodest good boy I've ever seen 
What you'd hear if there was sound with this:  
  
*"Who's a good boy???"*  
  
•dog starts panting and wagging tail excitedly. 
  
EDIT: we don't deserve dogs. Such pure. Many happiness. Wow. 
I get kinda frustrated when I see these posts. That's not the policy at all. It's just what people do to get around the policy. In NYC dogs must be in a carrier. This is supposed to mean a crate but most people use bags which isn't technically wrong.
/u/alicegagnon
I love how you can tell when he starts wagging his tail because part of the bag starts wagging when he opens his mouth
I once brought my 45lb dog onto the subway in NYC to bring him to an emergency vet and no one said anything to me. I had so much anxiety about doing that, but my concern for my dog was much greater. In fact, some lady helped me carry him through the station. I'll never forget that lady's kindness. I am pretty sure she thought I was a homeless person due to my disheveled state. 

My dog has a reaction to a tick preventive (a veterinary approved product) that rapidly dropped his heart rate and blood pressure so he was collapsing, pale, and had a heart rate of 40. Scary!
What a good hapi boi
it needs a hole for wagging tail to poke out
Can somebody already cut four holes in the suit case for their legs, so it would be a self walking suit case. I've been waiting for  picture to surface of a large dog wearing a suit case to ride the train.

BAG DOG.
So ppl shit puke and fuck in trains but dogs are the problem ok people of New York if you say so...
Who's a good dog? 
Illegal immigrants can relate.
That little smile just screams "Oh heck, I'm loved"
The epitome of stupid. Leave your damn dog at home if taking it with requires folding it into luggage like pet origami. Geezus. 
Why is no one petting good boy doggo?
Upvoted for not calling him a doggo.
Poor pupper-he/she looks very uncomfortable :(
I feel bad for that dog
Seems pretty cruel to me. I wonder how hot it gets in that bag.
The dog isnt smiling, hes just opening his mouth because dogs sweat through their tongue and hes probably very hot in that bag
I will write again, Golden Retrievers are saints. no other breed is as gentle, and good natured as these. 
Poor fella
That doggo looks way too big for that baggo
Same with BART
What a good dog!!!
Wow!!!
His smile was almost as big as mine
That dog does not give a fuck
This is fine... perfect size...I'm ok...
That fella is lovin' it!

Total bullshit, I've seen plenty of much larger dogs out of bags on the subway.

Do dogs smile? I never knew this. Am I becoming crazy?

real questions.
Saw the large dogs in bags posted earlier this month and thought hey I'll check out another ... Reddit comes through again cause that is just adorable. 
He's totally trolling the NYC subway. Even has the grin. 
Puppers has a shit eating grin
Lol awesome he's like "we're awesome, we're so sneaky is disgusting, great idea giant hairless dog"
That doggy looks like it's smiling. I love dog smiles.
i know reddit is garbage now because i saw this on the morning news before i saw it here 
Oh my heart!!  If I could upvote this 1000 times I would!
That's so fucking cute. 
That can't be good for that giant golden retriever lol
Sounds like a new kickstarter project
*Huehuehue this is fun*
Helllo,

Though my name says it all.. Please tell me what breed this is. Thanks.
#HueHueHue
He seems so grateful 
Well, that's a dumb rule. I get it, it's really packed in NYC, but, I mean... there's space. At least allow the owner to carry the pooch...
"Nope. Not my hooman. Not that one either. OH THERE'S MINE hehehehehe"
Apparently the key to getting a larger dog to stay in a bag like this is getting him super baked.
where did the dogs body go
GOOD WOOFER
General reposti
thasaboyzus
Hahaha look at that grin, he knows he's getting away with it. 
I don't understand. FIT in a bag or is IN a bag? 

Anything can fit in a bag if the bag is big enough. If the law says FIT in a bag then just bring your dog on a leash or something.
But does it paint for subway dads?
What type of dog is that 
Oh my god 😂😂😂 this is so funny 😂 damn itttt! 
That dog is having a great time.
I love how his eyes go from dog eyes to almost human eyes to happy dog eyes.
"This is my life now...."
What a happy, happy face!
Serious question: What on earth is are they trying to accomplish with that rule???
he just remembered something funny
This makes sense. Still cute but more efficient and safe for the subway
Heeeeelllppp

this. is. hilarious.
At least the dog thinks it's funny..
Good dog. 
What a good boy
Oh look! A doggo's head!
just watch out if nature calls
I cant stop smiling
Creepy... 
Dogs are friends not luggage.
TIL luggage = a bag
Good Boy brand is the best luggage.
The goodest of boys
This, all of this. I love every bit of it. My heart!
Are we winning boss ? Yes, yes we are !

Really? That's fucked up, why is this law in place? Makes no sense to me.
This looks very uncomfortable. Poor dog.
Can almost hear the kek
Some of them like their bags. It's humane..

People dont take into the consideration that people like me who are highly allergic to dogs that can trigger my asthma
Nn sta stretto??
Even for service dogs??
What dogs will do for their masters!
I wish I was a dog 🐶 
That "we tricked them!" smile was so great 😂
Plot twist: Owner is going on vacation and the dog snuck into the bag, classic Pixar storyline.
*sound of tail whacking inside of bag*
You think its a bag I pull a bamboozle again really doggo
Aww, look at that lovely doggy face! This post should go in r/funny. I laughed out loud when I saw that big face poking out of that not so big bag. 
That dog looks three times of that luggage i need to see the rest 
Best smile :-)
The one the best things is being on the underground and seeing a doggo. It's always a surprise.
Ah, when I visited NYC last week I was wondering why everyone in the subway had their dog in a bag. I thought it was just a New York thing.
You can see the exact moment he gets called a good boy.
That is the happiest dog ever lol
My dog died today, I shouldn't have looked at this.
I'm waiting for a malamute in a bag like [this](http://www.snugpak.com/military/military-packs-rucksacks/endurance)...
NYC is turning into a joke. Ugh. I miss my old city
What breed of dog is this?
Reddit knows. 
Pixels don't add up, but I would still love to see this.
It's important to accessorize with living things because our culture sucks 
Diiiiicks
How do we know it even has a body? It could be a dog with a robot body. Cyborg-Dog.
I'd maybe carry some re-freezable gel pouches to help them stay cool while in there.
So this NYC rule, is it a scam to increase dog bag sales? More tax, more sales, mo' money?
*Doggo does a sneak* lol SIKE I fucking hate ifunny it's cancer.
I love right when he smiles...what seems to be a tail...or something that looks a tail...starts wagging likke crazy
OMG that might be the cutest do EVER! Haven't owned a dog since around 4 years old and consider myself a cat guy, but I just want to hug the crap outta that dog
It doesn't look like the dog should fit in there
The dog scans for owners eye contact,  "look at me, I'm luggage "
It's like it knows it's cheat the system!
Isn't this animal atrocity?
So cute. Looks photoshopped. 
Now there's a reason to go to New York

Anybody else mildly disappointed doggo didn't receive the customary head scratch after the smile? 
"Hin hin hin hin we fooled the system!"
Yea, so just get a huge bag.
Old news is old
the dog expressed " look at me, Am I a good boy.Come on give me appraised touch on my head" by his smile 
😍
The only thing NYC is doing is creating dog brains with the entitlement of cats.
What if i fit into the bag? 
That is a head bag. It's full of heady goodness.
.
What a cutie!
"I don't know why I'm in this, but I love you."
It's all fun and games until an unattended bag is destroyed by security.
Never thought of this, I always just dress mine up in a nice ikea bag cloak 
If I fits I sits
They probably assumed it was aimed for small dogs but having a big dog in a bag seems OK to me too. I've been on trains where big dogs on a lead is hyper and jumps on people. 

Not everyone likes dogs, especially if you have had a bad experience with one biting you. 
“omg im stuck!!!"
Oliver and Co paints a much different picture of New York dogs 
This reminds me of my dogo. She's a St. Bernard so I'm not putting her in any luggage. But when I'm rubbing her belly she'll throw her heed back and look at me the same way 
Someone asked doggo who's the good boy and he's smiling.

Bag doggo
Not sure if zipper bouncing from train or overwhelming happy tail wags.
I'm not sure how regulated this rule is, being that I've seen many a large dog bag less outside thereof and no issue arose.

/r/maliciouscompliance 
If they want dogs that fit in bags unlike this doggo they probably want a handicapped annoying rat in the bag.
I wish Hong Kong did this with the MTR. You can bring dogs just about anywhere else (shops, malls, some restaurants). It would be so helpful if I could take my pupper on the train.  
If this was the owner's airline carry-on I wonder what kind of behemoth would be in their checked baggage 
The dogs like hahaha we're actually pulling this off.
That smile lifted my heart out of a dark place. 
I do not understand why we need to do stupid shit like this to be able to take what are clearly well trained dogs on public transport.

It would be better to allow everyone to be carried in their arms
What a good boy!
Half life 3
I think it's less about *fitting* in a bag and more about *keeping your dog in a bag.*
Haha! Love it!
Where's the story about the woman who brought her dead dog on the subway in a suitcase and told some dude it was a bunch of laptops and he ran off with the suitcase. 
I'm almost crying at how cute and happy this dog looks. The goodest of boys.
Someone tell me the fuck is happening between that woman's legs? I'm watching this on an inferior Apple incarnation after a decent amount of wine but I'm confident that's a creature from Labyrinth.

Omg...totally smiled when the dog smiled.
How do blind dogs fit into this rule?
And that, my friends, is how the Hot Dog was born in New York.
I've seen worded the same way a few times; "if the dog can fit in a bag". Every dog can fit in a bag if the bag is big enough. So then does the dog have to be in a bag? Or should the wording be "dog must be in bag"?
It looks like a golden retriever stuffed in a bowling bag.
fuck carring a ba for my dog.
Lol @ all the people freaking out about how cruel this is to the poor animal. Yes because he looks so fucking miserable amiright??? Y'all need to relax
That smile puts a smile on me 
Hey.... hey human.... hey.... I'm on the subway
What is this rule for? I see dogs on the Tube all the time and they're no bother. 
I can already hear the  tail wagging. Thump thump thump thump

I took a dog on the subway by putting her in a Xerox cardboard box.  No one gave me a second look.
Holy crap it's like Persona 5, but with a dog. 
He/she is so embarrassed!
 Thought this was a fairly new law? How did all of these people quickly train their dogs to do this? Is it not that hard to do?
Hehe how those flowers are positioned on the bag I thought it was Cookie Monster
He thinks he's a luggage

The pure chill of a golden. 
We're going on an adventure and it's warm in here! Best day ever!!
Indeed, and I think it's one of the most NYC rules possible. Any bag you say???
doggo asks if this is our stop? how about now, is this our stop?
Gentrification to NYC :D
Awh he loves it
He looks s

That dog is cheesing hard. 
Why are people actually putting their dogs in bags? It says "has to be able to fit in a bag" not "it has to be in a bag" 
Tail probably wagging like crazy
http://web.mta.info/nyct/rules/rules.htm

Section 1050.9

paragraph h.

Doesn't have to be a bag, but has to be an enclosure and not annoy other passengers. Service/working dogs are exempted (but must be leashed/harnessed etc)
That's a damn good boy. 
Dog is just saying thanks for taking me along and not leaving me in that stuffy apartment 
Dog looks happy that he found a loophole
Who's a good boy? You're a good boy. 
You can also register them as a service animal for <$100 online
Looks like a Digimon 
You can fit a St. Bernard in an IKEA bag.
My dog just sits under other people's legs lol

Anyone know what kind of luggage bag that is? Have been looking for a suitable one for my 40 lb pupper.
Aww...poor thing in a luggage...
why dogs are so great, doesnt matter what theyre transported in, aslong as youre with master LIFE IS GREAT!
old news lol..
All the more reason to carry your chihuahuas in your Gucci purse. 
Actually if you register your dog as a service animal no one can say no to you anywhere.  And it is unbelievably easy to register a service animal. 
He looks so proud of himself!!! 
I think i see a little bit of human in this dog.
such a well behaved pup
Why don't they let dogs on the subway otherwise?
That's inhumane the luggage is too small you should separate the load into two separate suitcases

Is this magic?! How big is that bag?
I'm so confused.... judging by the dogs head, I don't see it fitting in the bag but obviously it can. 

Wonder if it's half the dog? You know, the end with all the vital parts.

Is this a new law? Can someone explain?

I am from Adelaide (very conservative town in south Australia) we are defiantly not aloud dogs on our crappy hardly ever running trains. We were aloud to bring dogs into Bunnings for a short while however big dogs had to wear muzzles for some dumb reason- I guess the over 50s prefer toy dogs and that is the majority age of the population here.
What's in the other bag...
You're definitely the first one to think of this/make a post about this!

Sucks for all of us with pet allergies :/.
Are you allowed to cut leg holes in a bag? ✂️💼 🐕
Poor thing.  Dogs belong where they can be dogs not contents. 
He's probably hot and cramped. 
cruel
Sad that no one sticks up for the pooch. I mean how would the owners like it if their chubby ass was stuff into a suit case?
I've seen some disasters with dogs on the subway. Once, where the dog tried to play with a delivery guy who was startled, and dropped his deliveries and was nearly in tears (owner tried to laugh the incident off, walked away). The other incident ended a lot worse for the dog. Either way, these were larger dogs and the subway isn't a place for them. 
That's the look of someone who just started to gas out that particular section of the subway.
Haha that heartwarming smile thoughhhhh
That's not a full dog it's just a head. Must be hard playing fetch when it's just a head.
Luggage doggo = best doggo
That's brilliant policy, if your dog is looking out of a bag what harm can they cause others really?  
Animal abuse. 
Psssh for $150 get em certified as an emotional support dog and no one can tell you shit otherwise

To the tune of "drunk on a plane":

"I'm just a dog in a bag".
And people give me shit when I leave my dog locked in my car... smdh
This is it cute this is cruelty you shouldn't put dogs in bags it should be illegal..

Seems pretty cruel to me.
Unpopular opinion coming right up- When dogs pant like that it's because they're hot or dehydrated...
borderline cruel no?
Not true I seen a big ass blue nose pit at 42nd street yesterday
Looks stressed and probably overheating, but yeh if it's a short train ride I don't see the problem.
I don't get it. How can you imagine something you can't possibly do for yourselves for other little bing things. I'm sorry I eat animal flesh(meat) but this is beyond eating animal flesh. This is torture 
Beyond fucking selfish to have a companion in a city like NYC.  Fucking border line animal abuse.
PETA for life, you fat fuck
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad. I'm a pupper in a bag. I'm barkless, but not for long, he's hooman and I'm a dog.
This is such a ridiculous law. In Prague you don't need to do this. Goes to show how ridiculous NYC is.
How can I save this amazing video to my phone?
But officer, check the rules, my [dog] (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81meZhZVFHL._SX355_.jpg) fits.
This sounds awful for people who hate dogs.
