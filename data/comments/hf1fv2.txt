She looks like she's received so many pets they rubbed all her color off.
August has earned the right to tell all the young pups to stay off her lawn.
I had a yellow lab as a kid. lived to be 21 years old. kept telling my pops that it had to be a record and to call a paper or something. he didn't want her to be bothered with strangers trying to take pictures etc... 
RIP Lady. Smartest dog I've ever known.
That's an olden retriever!
Someone get that girl a tennis ball!!
My goodness she looks so wise!  I consider myself super lucky to have a small dog turning 16 in a month.  If I could have 20 years with him I'd be over the moon
Happy birthday to the oldest goodest girl!
So ... August was born in June?
Cheers for a happy 21st next year
OH man, 20!  My older golden is 13 1/2 and is starting to have problems getting up, especially on slippery floors.  She can walk all day, do long hikes with us and swim forever, but once she's lying down it's hard to get her up again.

I can't imagine 20!  Wish it could happen but there is no way.
Happy Birthday August. You look 👍 great ❤️
Almost old enough to drink 🍻

Her hoomans clearly love and treat her well ❤️
We have a seven month old golden retriever. I’ve always wanted one because every golden I met was so chill and relaxed. Nobody tells you about the first 2-3 years...  They are a spastic ball of unquenchable energy of cosmic proportions. Their destructive nature is only eclipsed by their constant need to get into trouble. The only thing that keeps the puppy monster at bay is continuous attention and 2-3 walks a day.  

Love her to pieces anyway though.

This is fascinating! I thought dogs can live in this world for just 12 yrs maximum, but wait, here's the dog that can break the record and I think this is the oldest dog that lives today.
So happy for her! Happy Birthday !!
Happy birthday August.☻☻
Somebody needs to teach her to not use her winter shade of foundation all year.
Congrats! What do you feed her?
Dogs with graying faces are so cute I love it
She looks DAMN good for 140 years old
I'd snuggle that face all day
What dog food does she eat I wonder?
Doesn't even look a day over 19 years and 10 months
This is why when people post pictures of their "18 year old dog" on a walk looking fit i call bs... you can easily tell what an old dog looks like by looking at it. I've seen people post really young looking dogs claiming them to be old af.


This one is definitely legit
I'm only a year older than her. Oh the stories she could tell..
Beautiful Lady❤❤
Happy birthday! 

So how long goldens life span is normally? Sorry not a dog person but learning. Also what equivalence of 20 years old golden to human age any idea?
What do you feed her? That's a long time!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AUGUST!

You're welcome to join us for a swim any day!

Happy birthday!
What a good girl!
Happy birthday August!! I want to pet her so much ❤️
That beautiful white face and the wisdom in those eyes.
omg Congratulations August!! lots of love for you and your family

&#x200B;

trowing a virtual ball 

hope you catch it
Congratulations!
August has thrived in life because of her pure spirit and the loving home she has to live in. 
Thank you for being good dog parents!
That’s what your parents told you.
Plz updoot this to Top of All Time.
I never thought a dog’s face could look... old. 

Amazing how much some animals can live when they have proper care.
20 years gold*
Old dog literally too good to die
Still a puppy in my opinion
She deserves all the pets in the world
Happy birthday, you perfect and beautiful lady!
Wholesome pup. Name is August. Is 20 in the year 2020... Maybe this means in august of 2020 everything will get better.
Awww look at her!

Reminds me of my Max. He made it to 14 before we had to let him go. Goldens have such a special place in people’s hearts. Happy birthday, August!! And many moreeee ♥️
Happy bday! That banner worth every penny
Happy Birthday beautiful old girl!
Way to go!! Headed for 21 I know it🥰❤️🤟
Sorry dude my brothers golden retriever is 23
So cute! Though she looks like she is in a lot of pain.
Happy birthday August!
Gorgeous baby!
Old Golden's are the best dog... Period.


I miss mine so much. 😭
A Venerable age.
Aaaawww sweet old dear! Happy 20th
Old enough to become a silver retriever. Love it
Please give her some cuddles and kisses from me ☺️
Link? I wonder how she’s holding up! Hope she’s still able to see, hear and control her bowels. Poor cutie!
I was curious if my childhood dog was an unknown record holder and its a possibility. Oliver, my pug, lived to a week shy of his 20th birthday which I think puts him on the list of oldest pugs.
I tought maybe my Aussie can be the oldest Aussie, turns out the oldest dog (Bluey, 29) is a Aussie :/
Golden oldie goldie
Olden Retriever
I can imagine you trying to play fetch and she sits you down to let you know the things she’s seen.
Awesome!  Happy birthday August!

My golden growing up died at 10 due to an infection in her stomach. She was the perfect dog to go through junior high and high school with. She helped me emotionally through a lot. Parents separating, brother and sister leaving for college, my own struggle with addiction. She was there. Miss her at times and will never forget the love she showed me.
;; I love seeing gold retrievers age. The older they get the more white they get on their face. It’s looks absolutely adorable. Very distinguished.
The goodest girl!
Goodest girl
Looking good at 140 years old,some of her early buried bones have become fossils.
Sweet golden, I had one and her sweetness lasted 19.5 years. HB!
Queen
Anyone that's had a dog knows old dog is best dog.
I adore when old Golden’s faces turn white; it’s so adorable and distinguised <3
This dog can legally smoke cigarettes, buy porn, even serve in the military. Yet she still isn’t allowed to drink alcohol. What the fuck is wrong with legislation in this country.
Here’s to the Goodest girl 🍻
Why can’t dogs and cats live longer?
It’s a total heartbreaker when they go.
Her name is officially Awwwww-gust on this subreddit! So pretty!
You mean olden retriever
Still a beauty!
Goldie but oldie
Happy Birthday August! 

Sincerely,

a fellow 20 year old August
Time for a dad joke: She’s old but gold
Damnit, it's not even July!  Let's not wish away summer. Nice dog pic, what's her name?
Oh my goodness, what’s her secret diet and health regiment. I need to start that immediately. She’s a living legend
Bitch living forever
 Bless her beautiful soul. I hope she lives forever.
We really are like elves to them. :-S
If she lives for a few more years, she'll be a Platinum Retriever.
This is one of the best things I’ve seen on reddit!
Happy birthday August! Today should forever be known as August Day!
That dog is 140 fucking years old.
Finally something everyone on Reddit can be happy about
GO GIRL!  Many treats and kisses to you.  Hope she's still waggin' that tail.
I LOVE SEEING THIS! My little Bella is 9 weeks a few days ago.

I'll remember to send pics in 20 years when she's still alive too :)
My dog would have been 18 this year. I had her since i was 1 till December 2017.
I spent most of my life with her and it still feel off without her. Take give August a treat from me :)
Golden Years Retriever
I'm going to name mi son or dother golden retriver and brake the record and you can't stop my
That towel makes me think there are some issues. But adorable issues.
Why is her name august if she was born in June? 😛
That's sweet
Someone get the treats!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(also technically she is 140 years old in human years which means she has outlived the queen of England)
Celebrating 20th bday in the year 2020... 😳 

She deserves the best 😍
doggo lord of wisdom
That’s a wise old woofer. Happy birthday August
You should get her a endorsement for whatever food you have been feeding her
August I love you!!!
Happy birthday August 🎂
What a good boy 😄
Please God may my golden boy live this long and be healthy! Amen.
So precious 💖
She’s gorg
Oldie but goldie.

Happy birthday, August. 🎉
Sweet old lady. 100/10 would help take her garbage out.
what a good girl!
Happy Birthday, August!!!
She has a nice sprinkle of powdered sugar on her sweet face :)
She deserves 20 treats to celebrate.
Just think how many people she made smile in her life!

Happy Birthday August!
Her whole face is grey, lmao.

The stress! The stress!
Would be a great "circle of life" moment if she passes during the month of August.
Happy birthday beautiful August 🥳
Wow, congratulations to her, and phenomenal job to her humans!
Happy birthday August! Give her a hug for us!  🥰
aww
Very fitting name, august indeed
What a sweet girl. I can’t help but just feel so heartbroken and robbed that my best friend only lived to be 8 years old.
Happy birthday!!!!
This was once a puppy
That deserves 20 smooches on the head, 20 snoot boops, and all the belly rubs!
She’s a good girl <3
🥰🥰🥰
😭❤️😭❤️😭❤️
Why is her head white?
Wow she is 5 days older than me
Newest member of the Golden Girls!
Awww that white face!  Good job taking good care of her.  My dog is 13-14 years old and he's already list all of his color from his entire coat.  I call it the buff look.
She looks like she has vitiligo and it's the cutest thing
20! Wow!
Happy birthday puppers!!
awe such a good doggo and beautiful
I would kiss the pup right in the head, what a cutie
Aww she is so cute happy birthday!
A dog with grey hair...........that’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Wait.. she was born in June, June is a name often given to Women, and they decided to call her August?
Soon, she will evolve into a luck dragon.
Happy birthday, August!
Happy birthday !
Happy birthday August!!:)
>Dog born in June

What should we name her?

I've got a *great* idea
I love her
Such a good girl. ♥
😢
Happy Birthday August
AUGUST
She wasn't born in August though
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday sweet August! 😘
Happy bday August, may u live a lot more years :D
August must have a really kick ass life!
This makes me happy and sad. My golden is getting older now. I hope he makes it to twenty but sadly I know he most likely won't.
Thats so cute! I hope she is well, my family had to put down our 17 year old border collie last month, we thought she was old!

Happy birthday to her!
that is incredible
She’s a supermodel! So gorgeous!
Amazing!
My boxer, Angus, just passed away yesterday at the age of 11. What I would have given to see him even hit 12 let alone 20.
Is it yours or...?
Had to put my golden down a few weeks after his 12th birthday. Was the hardest day of my life and I still cry about it 18 months later. This family is so lucky to be able to spend 20 years with such an amazing pup. Happy birthday August!
What a good girl! Happy bday August! Kisses and hugs!
Man, old dogs are so cute.
But does she shit everywhere everyday all day like my 17 year old?
Literally, the goodest girl.
Such a good girl.

Plus she looks so METAL!
She's older than me :O (by 1 year).
Happy birthday, sweet girl. You’re a legend!
Looks like it’s almost December 😢
How nice. I have a staffie cross that is around 19.
Happy Birthday August!
Happy birthday!!
Good job august!!!
Why do their faces get so light as they get older?
Happy bday young lady 🤗😁😙😎😍.
I guess we'll take your word for it huh
Amazing!! I had a beagle black lab mix who loved to be 22! She was the vet’s oldest living patient :) Your baby is beautiful!!
That's awesome
Awww 😍❤️💕
shes so cutee
Golden oldie!
She’s 140 years old :0
Please tell her I said hi!!!! And happy birthday (or cakeday from all of us!!
"woof woof my life is suffering"
i would give the rest of my years to her if i could
What a beautiful girl! Happy birthday, 20 years young.
T strut tv can tree cv
Happy Birthday, August!
I love how Good Hoomans made sure Good Girl has a towel to keep her comfy.
Good girl.
What do you guys feed her? I need to know
What a queen
I love Goldens. Our girl is 13 right now. I hope she makes it to 20 and beyond.
Nice
Goodest of golden girls
She’s an absolute 👼 😍
The picture of her on the banner reminds me of Pennywise
Happy Birthday!! 🎉
White Gold.
Happy Birthday August! ❤️🐾
Its older than me
Happy Birthday August. Give her a petting from all of us
That's a dog. Good dog.
Probably still acts like a puppy tho :)
I can tell she has good humans and is well looked after.
Good beast
Now take her DNA, find the next oldest living dog and let's start a proper stewardship of our dearest friends.

We should have been breeding them to live this long instead of what the latest idiot fad is.
Congrats to August! Hope she’s in the decent shape and still enjoys life
But it isnt august so how's it her bday ;)?
Wow
Sweet girl. Bless her heart.
My golden retriever is 11, and I see each new day as a blessing.

God, I wish my girl would live that long...
She's beautiful and what a gift to have her for 20 years!
August, born in June?
Dose she hold a record for longest living golden retriever? Or just a pretty 20 yr old pup?
Cute august! Make sure to give her joints a little massage - lord knows I need those as a 20 year old.
The rarest of pups!!!!
I'm kinda tired, but I also kinda want to go out.
Awww what a sweet girl! Happy 20th birthday August! ❤️
Still looks so healthy!  My 15 year old pup looks more 'ruff' ;)
Born in June, named August
looks like August has a pretty sweet setup out there.
Happy Barkday August! 😘
Having a 1.5 year old golden, this makes me very happy.
Happy bday August! Such beauty and a lovely name to boot ❤️🌹🐕
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AUGUST!! 🎉🎉🎉
She must give the most and best kisses ever judging from the coat color change
I see a very good girl!

Edit: happy birthday August!
Yeeeeeeee happy birthday yold bork 💜💜🤘🍻
I hope my companion will be able to live a long life like August. They bring such joy and love and warmth into our lives
But it’s only June
What a sweet pup! 😍
Awww happy birthday to the best darkest girl around! GOOD GIRL!
Holy moly! That girl is a 140 years old in hunan years! 😲
It has the same coloration as a griffon vulture
I would have named her June
Wow 20 years old, happy birthday
Same bday as Bakugou
Happy birthday, August!!!!
That's an old bitch! Good Girl.
She's the oldest and bestest of girls may she live longer.
Oh wow I didn't know 20 was the oldest.

My old golden made it to 19. Which I knew was *very* old for goldens.
She was born just a month or so after my 20 year old cat.
Call Guinness
Aww-gust
Hopefully she was bred. It's be nice for these genes to be more prevalent across the species so we can have our best friends stay with us longer.
Did the cocaine keep her alive?
Incredible!!
What's her secret? Ours is 3 y.o. and I can't think of the day she'll leave us, I want her to stay with us as much as possible!
Give this angel all the pats
Congratulations!!! 🎈
Happy Birthday!
Happy birthday sweet girl!!!
This dog is just holding on until it’s master returns from an unscheduled 20 year trip.
Happy birthday sweet baby!!!
“Elderly” “pets” “legends”
Nice!
Bruh you're telling me her birthday is june tho??
Look at that sugar face. 

What a beautiful dog.
Hug her for me pls
Nice - my current dog's name is August - my last two where September and October - 

&#x200B;

She is a good pup!
I just visited my uncles dog for the first time since before the pandemic and I noticed around his eyes had turned just as white
Wow she is beautiful ❤️
Good pup
What is you secret August. My name is Ness and I am 161/2, I can't hear, but I do climb down rocks to the beach.
August would have a quest waiting for us
She’s beautiful! Happy Birthday August you bright and sunshiny girl you!
That's an amazing achievement, happy birthday August 🥳🎊🎉🎈💖
So much celebration but she has no idea what’s going on.
Why name a dog August who was born in June?
Happy Birthday, August!
Happy Birthday August!
Damn 2000 gang
All August born including animals loves petting and also feels no shy strategy
Loves all but just wants to chill with the family :)
140 years old holy shit
Aww!
Wow! Your certainly are taking great care of her!
Heckin good pupper!

The Goldest Girl

Her face is just completely white. She's a beautiful ol' girl and it's so striking.
Good genetics
Happy Barkday princess
Ohhh what a sweet treasure. Its been a rough couple days and seeing this gave me the first authentic smile I've had in a while.
aww! hopefully she live to be 21 and older
Wow that's really rare for a big dog,normally the big species just live for 7-10 years that's really great she deserves a big party
Happy birthday, August!
What do you kind of food do you feed her?
happy birthday August
So August was born in June?
Precious, precious baby
Congrats!
But she can't have become the oldest by becoming 20... the previous oldest Retriever has to have died...
Happy Birthday August 🥺🎉🥰
Amazing! My rot/lab/Shep mix made it to 19yrs before health issues arose. Beautiful dog
Happy birthday August!!
Happy to share the same name with this pupper!
Golden oldies
I love old puppies so much.
Who's a pretty girl?
I love her
Twenty years is astounding!  My girl made it to 17 and I still miss her happy greetings and wet cold nose.
Wow, 2 decades! I wish my dogs would live as long as that. Happy birthday August. 🎉
She's heckin' seen it all
Why does this dog look like it's asking me if I've had enough pie and to take another piece?
Why didnt you name her june?
I love her!! She's doing great!!
Digs get white hair too?
My dad was right, always go with a Golden.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, sweet girl!
Damn this dog as old as me o.O
It's a credit to your love and care for her that she has lived so long and well. May she continue!
Happy birthday to this beautiful girl! 😍🥰
She looks like a crypt keeper dog
She is PERFECT!
Gosh. My aunts goden only lived to be 7 years old... I wish Bella girl could've stayed with us longer.
I love her
Shes earned an unlimited treat pass :)
No fuckin way. Happy doggy day bubbas!!!
Is it possible to learn this power?
Happy b day
 Wow 20 years old that used to be rare for dogs
Look at her wonderful silver face.
Happy Birthday
Wow what a good girl
OMG HAPPY BIRTHDAY YOU SWEET BABY
Happy Birthday 🎉🎉🎂🎂
Yo Cheers
My first golden’s name was August. She only lived a few years before dying from cancer when I was a kid. I’m so happy there’s another one that has lived a good, long life!
Well this just made my day :)
I often wonder how people can make claims like this since, I imagine, dog ages are probably one of the least reported stats imaginable. How does one get in touch with whoever keeps track of this? I ask because my golden retriever will turn 22 in november. Also happy birthday august!
Can I kiss and give some ear scratches.
God Bless you sweet soul
😘🤩 Bless her xxx Good genes and even better carers, well done!
Should rename the dog December.
20 years old in 2020. Atleast we got this
Happy birthday August!
Happy birthday, August!!! Much love 💗
Happy birthday sweetheart 🥺💖💖
I bet they called her Augie at first but after becoming a senior the owners dropped the nickname out of respect
The goodest of girls
To think, this dog was almost fully grown when 9/11 happened...
She keeps her tennis balls on the bottom of her walker legs. 🎾 🎾 🎾 🎾
I am so happy I get to share my birthday with this gorgeous girl! Happy birthday!!!
She’s 140 in people years.
Congratulations to a really cute dog. That dog really deserves a big bone.
Who’s August and why is there a picture of the cake on the banner?
This bitch looks like pennywise
My golden growing up lived to be 15
This bitch older than me. I love her
Wow!!! God bless dear August! 
The wisest and goodest of all the boys I’m sure! Here’s to many more birthdays!
Yay food her
She’s the bestest girl!
Good gorl
She looks in pain
Mines turning 16 this summer. Maybe there’s a chance that he’ll get to live as logg big as her and that makes me happy
She's a platinum retriever now.
I wonder what kind of personality she has? Is she really sweet, or old and senile (like my dog who is 17 lol)
I just realized, soon there won’t be a single dog left alive older than me. Im in my early twenties. Don’t know but that realization kinda fucked with me.
The goodest of girls
Sweet. My bday is August 20th. Wierd..
What are they feeding it?
Ah. Ill let you keep the title, but my dad's has been twenty for a few months.
What does August eat and how much does she exercise?
But it's only June
Happy birthday August!
Why do old Goldens have that weird coloration on their heads? I’m not saying it’s ugly, I’m just genuinely curious. Also happy birthday August!
I will heart broken if that dog dies
This really is a  Aww
Such a good girl!
Ah yes, born in June...named August
My English Teacher's first name was Ms. June
The oldest good girl to ever exist <3
Looks like she already got caked
She's very adorable
Happy Birthday August !
Just me or am I mildly infuriated that her name is August, but her birthday is in June?
This dog is literally older than me.

It's only by a few days, but still. Damn.

That's an old lady.
Happy Birthday, Gorgeous! 💛🐾🐾
The goodest of girls
So she is 120 years old ?
Happy birthday, may she live another 20 years in the very least.
20 years!? Damn that's a lot
I love her.
an angel❤️
What food does she eat?

My lab is named August! Just because we thought it was a pretty name (we also happened to get her in August lol)
Old but gold
I hope she will be around for a few more years
I wonder if she knows any new tricks?
My golden is 14.5. A little more hard or hearing and seeing and his hips hurt but he’s still a really good boy. 

Our first child before my wife popped out the 3 human children haha
This makes me happy
.....and doesn't she look happy.
This dog legit looks like an old lady
Ghostface killa
happy birthday August   :)
Happy birthday 🎂🎂
“I am tired.”
Poor girl. She really does look old. At least she and you both have 20 years of great memories together.
Precious
Better not be like the great outdoors movie.
And she still loves you
There are not many dogs left that still remember 9/11!
That’s 140 in dog years. Wowee!
Long live
That’s 140 because 1 year is 7 years for dogs.
Happy birthday!!! Such a good girl
Olden Retriever
Happy birthday old girl!! Lets hope we can celebrate you next year too <3
Dang
Hugs to August 💗
Awww! <3
June*
Happy birthday August! 😍
Why am I cryin in da club
Aw she’s done such a good job ❤️
Happy 20th sweet girl❤️
Now that is a good pupper if I ever did see one.
Just as precious today as the day you received her.
Good girl
Happy birthday!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
OMG!! My baby will be 10 yrs in just over a week. This makes me happy
May she live 20 more
What a lucky lady! ❤️
Happy birthday August you beautiful girl you...
She's beautiful.
Wow that's crazy to think about. I was in 8th grade when that dog was born, now I'm 33. That's nutty.
Pretty girl!
Some would argue to euthanise this dog, not me tho
Happiest of birthday's to you August!
happy birthday, queen!
Happy Birthday sweet August!!
Happy birthday, big girl. You’re such a good doggo and you are so loved.
Wow
Happy Birthday, old Girl❣️
Oh my goodness WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BABBY SWEET ANGEL MOST PRECIOUS PUP !!!!!
Sooooo sweet!!
I wish they all lived that old. My old man was 10 when he passed. 

Such a sweet girl, hope she got lots of treats!
Sugar face!
What a sweet little goober!
r/oldmandog
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She may be old but she is still a puppy in her heart
Gratz, with the insane amount of inbreeding and genetic issues that is dam miracle.
These comments are so low effort jeez
But it's June
She actually looks in great shape compared to other dogs i’ve seen of similar age. Bravo to her and the owners!
Yeah, yeah, totally adorable... I need to know: Does anyone else read this with the robotic auto-caller voice on the words "20th" and "August" because they're in a different font and obviously typed into a template? Cause I can't NOT do that and I think my brain is broken.
❤️❤️❤️😙
Happy 140th
She’s definitely a good girl
Congratulations!!!!! What a beautiful girl ❤️
Just wanted to say, happy born day to August from Canada :)
Happy birthday August! You pretty and good girl!
Happy birthday to the original Good Girl 🦴🦴
I swear my golden is destined to live this long, hes currently 5 and not slowing down. Loves to run and has unlimited energy.
Our golden is 12 and so fragile these days... 😭😭😭
Why dogs beign big only live for like 15-20 years and parrots for like 80+
Why can't the "20" be in the same font as the rest of the sign? Tragedy.
Still has such a pretty coat too
She's turning into a platinum retriever. Beautiful girl!
That retriever's hit its Golden Age
WE LOVE AUGUST
Happy birthday sweet pup 🎂🎉🎁
Omg the amount of tippy taps this beautiful doggo must of had 😁
August is so precious
Wow! Congrats august!❤️
Wish my dog reach this age too!
I hope she is healthy and not in any pain.

The dont think the dog could give a fuck about some human created award, but I sure hope for that dogs sake she isnt in any pain or suffering at all just so her owners can get an award.
Oldie but a goodie.
she’s a month older than i am!
Awwwwwwwww
Happy 20th Birthday, August!
she’s beautiful
Happy birthday, August!
One of the few dogs that remembers a pre-9/11 world.
I could’ve swore that month has been around longer than that. 

But really, happiest of birthdays to the beautiful pup!
I don't think my folks even called me on my 20th birthday, let alone getting a whole banner.
Look at that Sugarface! I LOVE HER. 😍
Oh, Lawd, she is tired!
Aww!  Is she in decent health?
Let me guess, she was born in June.
I think this is the second old dog I’ve seen on reddit, I think I saw a 30year old cat too! 
What’s your secret, do you feed the dog potions and elixirs?
aww
What are you feeding this good girl, I need my dog to also live to infinity and beyond
This.
Hey, my birthday is the 20th of August!
140 in human years never looked so good
You would think they would have named her June...
[deleted]
oh my goodness! happiest of birthdays August!
Happy Birthday!
Why do old dogs look so cute, but old people look so offputting?

We should cover old people in fur to make them more appealing to the younger generations.
Awww, I wish mine lasted as long! Such a lucky person, golden’s are truly angels with fur.
Happy birthday August  😊🎂.
That bitch is over 140 years old!
What have you feed her?
Doesn't look a day older than 2 :)
Tell me your secrets! Mine lived till 13, which is pretty good going.
What a beautiful dog
Holy shit we’re the same age and I’VE had trouble making it this far. What a trooper!
Oooo we were born the same day
Aweee endless pets and love
Weird to think there’s no more retrievers born before the 21st century
The goodest!
Happy birthday august I hope many more to come for you!
 A beautiful lady! Many well wishes and happy returns for August.
r/rarepuppers
What a grand old lady she is!  I'd love to give her a big hug and lots of pets. Happy Birthday, August!
But it’s June!
One good girl
Happy birthday August!!!
Happy birthday August. Have a fab day!
Congratulations, you sweet, sweet pupper! ❤️😭❤️😭
Happy birthday gorgeous!!
Happy birthday!!!
My 25 year old cat: First time?
August! You are so beautiful!
I’m so angry & frustrated right now for other reasons, legitimately so happy that you posted this. I genuinely thank you
August is a damn good name. Good for her!!!
She kinda looks like a [Hereford cow](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Hereford_bull_large.jpg)
What’s the secret?
Is she ok? She got a really pale look
Wow so far past the greybeard stage she's gone totally white! That's an old pupper right there.
Look at the ole girl. Aww, who's the goodest girl
Nice
Happy Birthday August! 😘 Awe. What did those youngins do to you? Go ahead I'll listen..
Isn’t that like equivalent to a 300 year old human?
Me when I accidentally add too much sunscreen to my face
This dog was born in the year 2000. Feel old yet?!
Whats the world record? I had a black lab/ chow mix that lived until she was 22.
Slowly turning into a ghost :(
She looks wise, what is her wisdom?

God dammit now I'll chuckle on the 20th of August and I won't even remember why
As someone who lost their golden last year and still recovering from the loss of a 15 year love I can never replace. I sincerely hope the family of August realizes how lucky they are. She’s adorable and I wish I could give all the pets to her
Yes, I’m pretty sure that’s the goodest girl. Whew, I’m sure she’s gettin’ lots of heckin’ pets.
Happy birthday sweet one!
Looks just like an utter sweetheart.
What is that dogs diet?
awe you guys are so blessed
Looks like she’s had enough.
Happy birthday August! Hope she recieves many pats for her birthday!
Why is her name not June?
It's not August...
Wow. Our late female rat terrier, Gracie, lived to be twenty-one.
She’s 3 yrs older than me!! Dope
Glad that there's still dogs older than me. I'm not looking forward to the day when there's no older dog anymore...
It's like she's saying

"You would not believe the love I've seen"
Hello, August.
See? A classy example of white-face!
Happy Birthday August!
Awwww
What a sweet sugah 😍😍
G(old)
You take that back! My dog will live forever, and screw you for implying that she won't. (sniff)
Happy 20th Birthday August!!!! Time flies doesn't it.
Happy birthday precious August! Kisses from Baxter and me! 💋🎁🎂❤️🎉🥰
Happy birffday August!😻
She look like she fell face first into a white paint bucket. Happy birthday!
Happy birthday August!!
Beauty!
My parents had to put down their golden retriever this morning.  Our family had two live and incredible 15 years, and this one live 9.5 years.  20 years for a dog is unreal.
And I thought the Golden I had that lived to be 16 was old (she looked a lot like August).
I can't see that dog making it to August
Happy birthday beautiful!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AUGUST❤
August is older than me :0
the picture of her kind of looks like tim curry's IT
,
Damn that dog is older than me
What a good girl!!
She looks like Midas touched her and left a handprint on her face. Gold all over but her face. So cute!!!
That good girl is older than me
What if her birthday was actually IN August? ;)

Seriously, though; congratulations! :D
Wow, shes reach transcendence level
20 years gold 🐶🙃
I always tell my 7 year old golden she isn't allowed to die. This gives me hope.
Happy Birthday August
She’s got a very boopable snoot
Jesus someone get her a treat!
Looks like she has a Heart of Gold
Are we blind?! Deploy the treats!
When August makes it to 21 better let him celebrate with some champagne
Wow!  What're you feeding that girl?
"But it's June."
Silver Retriever
Awwww yeeeaa! Happy Birthday August!
Happiest birthday August! Maybe she is the oldest but I'm sure she has the goldest years. Wish her the best!
I hope she is doing well. I have a 13 year old bulldog! Only 7 more years to go :)
Wait is there seven dog years in a year? Because if that is then she is 140 in dog years
140 years old hot damn
Happy birthday!
What a good girl. ❤️
Does science work on extending the life expectancy of pets as well as humans? I realy wonder. Will my grandchildren be able to have dogs and cats for life?
I wondered if her owner is red?
20 good years
Wow, happy birthday August! She sure is a beauty.
Happy Birthday!
Omg I ❤️her
Why do pets have such shorter lifespans than people?
Happy 20th Birthday August! That is an amazing milestone for a golden and a big dog!!! 🤩😘
God bless her still pretty after all these years
long may she reign
Happy birthday August!!!
Did the font not support numbers?
Skull dog. Love her. Please give pats
Happy birthday good girl ❤️
This dog is older than i am.
What a sweety!
Yaaaay. My jack Russell is 19 now 😁
I feel a bit better knowing that their are pets who are still a bit older than me. Happy birthday puppers!
She looks wise
Fabulous! Beautiful girl. She has earned the right to get whatever she wants.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY AUGUST
Officially the best wise girl

Happy 20th Sweet doggy!
Beautiful baby! Deserves all the pets.
Dog's probably hella confused about what's going on
Happy BDay August.  The Betty White Of Goldens!
He looks like Cubone.
Aww. My lab is 14. He aint doing so good though.
Lol, she's probably older than like a third of the people on reddit.
So adorable and beautiful. If her birthday's in June, why did you name her August?
She looks like the dog version of Pennywise.
Shes absolutely beautiful. Congrats
its always nice to see older animals. puppies are cute and all but there is something inspiring about older animals.
Sweet thing. Does she even know what's happening?
That dog have seen some shit
Wow, so glad to see her still living life.
Rock on August! Happy Birthday
That’s 140 in human years!
It’s great to see old goldens like this. I had one, Jessie, who lived to be 17.
Shes a good girl the goodest girl ever
Why is her head fur white
Her name is August yet she was born in June???
That is like a sign Leslie Knope would make

And congratulations August!

My golden retriever is 18, I was hoping he would see 20 but he has started to go downhill fast now.
