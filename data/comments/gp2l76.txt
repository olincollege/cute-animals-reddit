This has to be one of the cutest things I‚Äôve ever seen
Cats are in this weird spot between being the wisest of all creatures whilst simultaneously being completely aloof. It‚Äôs as if they‚Äôre completely aware of their surroundings at all times - but don‚Äôt understand any of it. This is why I think they might be aliens
probably feels/looks similar to playing with a small mouse

We had a cat who played with fresh jalape√±os. He would leave all other vegetables alone, but would jump on the counter (only time he‚Äôd do that too because we don‚Äôt allow cats on the counters) and steal the jalape√±os. I would find them all over the house. 

Damn I miss that cat.

Keep your eyes on the cherry. That‚Äôs right. Back and forth. Feel your eyelids getting heavy. You‚Äôre sinking deeper. Deeper.

She's charging them up for you. That's a flavor boost right there. You always want to wake the pit up before eating.

Cherries are the mousies of fruit.
One of my cats does this with strawberries! She'll rub herself and her head all over the container of strawberries when I bring them home. It's really common apparently. There's something in certain fruits that cats just absolutely go insane for.
Cute. And THAT right there is why I don't eat other people's foods specifically if they have a pet. Forget potlucks.

It must be nice to have a cat :')
This is super cute and funny but you shouldn‚Äôt let your cat take food directly out of the container. That‚Äôs a way to develop some really unwanted habits down the line. Maybe find a toy that is similar in form to a cherry your kitty can swing around. Or at least set one cherry aside from the box.

We have one like this as well, except his favorite thing to do with it is bat it around with his paws, often knocking it off the table.

Is this behavior linked to the predator/reward instinct? 

Shaking a mouse etc?
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre feeling sleepy..‚Äù
One of mine dies this with any toy with a tail. She goes back and forth until she gets a spin on it

Kakyoin?
My grandma used to have a cat that would do this with peppermint candies
This means that she has an overdose of vitamins =))

She might be pretending it is a mouse. Lol
I like the pause like: "you think this is funny Steve? Mind your own business"
Rubber Soul approves

My cat does this with necklaces. I always assumed it got stuck in her little babycorn teeth and she‚Äôs trying to get it out.
Cats are weird.
this is why I come here!
KAKYOIN?
We need a r/whatswrongwithyourcat subreddit.  Ha, ha. Joke's on me. There IS a subreddit with that title AND you have already cross-posted there! Welp, adding another one to my list of subreddits.
Maybe she's just trying to get the stem off? Like shaking a tree to get the apple to fall. Or kitty is just being silly :P either works.

This is the best thing I've ever seen, and I've seen, like, three things.
My cat does the same thing!  She loves just holding it in her mouth by the stem and letting it bounc around when she walks.
Favourite video of the week. The look in the end is just hilarious!
I‚Äôve never really thought cats were cute, but this cat is beautiful, and seems like she has a great personality
Boiiiinnnnnngggg
Cutie!
Wow that kitty has been in quarantine too long!
What a pretty girl
