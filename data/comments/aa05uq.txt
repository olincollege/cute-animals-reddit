You are a lucky man.
I showed my Rotts Angus and Odin this picture and asked them why we can‚Äôt take nice photos like that and Angus proceeded to fart all over the couch. Excellent photo mate
The sunlight gives this a Renaissance painting quality.
This is frame-worthy as hell 
[deleted]
What kind of dog is he ? I have a basset/pit/lab and his poops have put me to shame
I don't want to make things awkard, but that isn't a moose.
He looks like he‚Äôs a very good boy
Grover does have floppy ears but I believe they are proportional, he‚Äôs 55 lbs and he‚Äôs got stubby basset legs
I also have a giant, clumsy, slobbering, fart-machine lap-dog (aka Rottweiler). Such a sweet breed. [taste tester](https://imgur.com/a/WRR9Y03)
Rottweilers are the most loving intelligent beautiful animals..... I miss my boy every day üò¢
This is killing me right now.  My sweet boy is 14 and we're looking at having to put him down soon.  He's too damn stubborn, but he's lost almost all quality of life.

Cherish each moment with your pup.  I've been printing and framing pics of my guy recently.
Hey!  My doggo's name is Moose also!

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/JL7O0dO.jpg) he is sitting like a dork!
Awesome pic.  Moose looks like the perfect good boy.
Great picture. Looks like a good boy co-pilot.
[After some slight color correction](https://i.imgur.com/zyZdjLV.jpg) 

Did what I could with a jpeg :)
This looks so angelic
I have one rotten rottie laying here crop-dusting me. I love this dog as much as my kids. 

Hugs from Roxy to Moose. 
There is no substitute for the love and loyalty they show us. We don't deserve dogs. 
Look at that Moose. He loves you just as much as you love him üíõ
The essence of love. 
Can confirm...have had two Rotties.  Miss them dearly.
Such love and trust in those eyes. 
Amazing boy there. I have an 11yr old German rotty and he is the most amazing companion. I recently got a Siberian husky she is not even 3yr yet and she loves Zeus but sadly he can‚Äôt play with her and he is getting worse as he gets older. He will be 12 in a month or so. Sucks but I‚Äôm already preparing myself mentally to deal with losing him next year.  Give your boy some head scratches and belly rubs from me and my pups Zeus and Pasha. Have a happy new year! 
Is he sleeping or dying OP? This is very important context that will change the feelings of this post.
Boop
I'm very lucky to know that feeling well . . . looks like Moose knows it, too! Cheers from Roxy and I in Chicago!!!
That's no moose!
My dog's nickname was Moose (:
Please dont be dead, please dont be dead.. 

"Moose is just over a year, he's still a pup." -OP

Thank baby jesus, its a reddit christmas miracle.
Hey wait isn‚Äôt that a Dog?
I'm sorry OP but I believe you've been fooled, that's a doggo, not a moose!
Dude I don‚Äôt wanna be the one to break it to ya
But I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs a moose
Nothing more satisfying than an exhausted Rottie. My friend has 2 and they are 100lbs of pure cuddle. They basically turn to liquid when we snuggle on the couch. 10/10 good girls. Happy you've got yourself one :)
My dog is going through a rough time it may or may not be his last week if he doesn‚Äôt recover. 
Its been 3 days and he already has multiple platinums, and is on top of all time.  He deserves it though.
Truly beautiful
Ah! We have a Rottweiler named moose too! Perfect name for the breed. 
RIP. He will be missed.
Sorry to break it to you, but that's actually a dog.
Great name. 
[deleted]
Moose is the perfect name for a pup that big and ‚Äòferocious‚Äô. Give him a pup cone for me.
I hope you have many more years together.  He looks like a gentle boy. 
he looks like the farm dog in waterShip Down at the end =)
Mynd you, m√∏√∏se bites Kan be pretty nasti
For a second I thought it was a picture from him/her having died... thank god it‚Äôs not
Hate to break it to you bro but that‚Äôs a dog, not a moose
Moose has great nails. 
My pup's name is also moose!
Moose is still alive right OP? I'm hoping this isn't a pre final vet visit :(
I‚Äôm sorry, ‚Äúbeing‚Äù? Please tell me Moose is still with you
Did anyone else almost immediately start crying when they saw this picture? Hit me right in the gut! 
[deleted]
I want up vote this at least 10 more times. 
I absolutely adore Rottweilers
I call my big boy moose as well. His best friend, my border collie I call goose. Not their real names, but it‚Äôs funny to me. Monkey is also a popular one because they are bananas together. Turns a grown man into a child when he has such a good best friend. 
Truly, this deserves a standing aww-vation!
God in heaven I miss my Rottie.
Rotties are the absolute best! I got a female. Her name is Raygen, were call her Ray, she is the best dog I've ever had.
I got an email notification about that post and I truly said "aww" when I saw the picture, without even knowing this is under r/aww. Moose is so sweet.

&#x200B;
Shared on Twitter. This cant be shared enough. What a beautiful puppy! 

I miss my rott brother Max everyday. ‚ù§ 

Dogs are the best.  

I had to put my Golden down on July 5th, 2018.  She was responding well to her chemo for leukemia, but then her masticory muscles began to atrophy and she could not eat without pain.  At 13 years, 8 months I did the hardest thing I have ever done in my 57 years on earth, and I had her put down.  I held her until the very end.

I'll never get another dog - it was far too painful at the end.  :(  

Peace to all of you who have been through the same thing.
What a swell guy. 
that is such a high quality photo for so many reasons 
Do you think somewhere in the world there is a pet moose named Dog?  Only seems fair.

Looks like a good boy! Take care of each other.
Dude, I wish I had a partner in crime like yours big guy 
Both owner and pet are well loved by one another. Beautiful. 
Enjoy.....simply enjoy....  üëåüèº
This just made my day  :)
So cute! Great name.
As a Rottie mom, I know this feeling. My Rottie has been the most amazing dog I've ever had. She's a rescue but has such a calm, loving demeanor and I'm so lucky with her temperament. She's gotten me through a lot of dark times. 
This pic is magical 
What a good boy! I have a Great Pyr named Moose‚ù§Ô∏è
I find that Rottweilers are more dog than the average dog. Good Dog.
I love his "ooh that's the spot" face
Your tattoos look pretty cool 
You know he‚Äôs thinking the same thing about you.
Big paws means big love. Little paws do, to, but whatever.
100% love
Moose isn‚Äôt eating spaghettis with other rottis upstairs is he? 
r/AccidentalRenaissance
You should print this on canvas and frame it really nicely
Man I hate to break it to you, but that's not a moose. 
For me, there is no love comparable to that of an animal. Moose‚Äôs picture went directly to my soul. I believe animals are pure, and when they give us their love, it is the real deal and untainted by human ego. Thank you for sharing this. 
Silly human that's not a moose, that is clearly a duck
Me clicking this topic: HE BETTER NOT SAY IN THE COMMENTS THE DOG HAS DIED.... \*clicks\* ah ok he's good. 
That's not a moose, you silly goose!
I'm pretty sure that's a dog.
This made me sad until I saw OP talking in the present tense
I don't know why but when I read this title, I got the impression that he had passed away. After reading the comments, I am VERY glad I seem to be mistaken?
This pic is too sexy 
So very cute. I have edited the pic for you. Hope you like! [Edited](https://i.imgur.com/eg6M1Cx.jpg)
He look dead 
So cute, name and dogüòç And I am actually curious about the tattoo what is it
Hey wait a minute! That's not a moose, that's a dog. Op, whoever you got him from bamboozled you.
For he is not just a pet nor a mere dog but a long life companion...

Forever in our hearts you remain
The one and only Moose.
Men can‚Äôt even hope of becoming as loyal as dogs. Easily the most faithful and friendly creatures to ever grace this earth. ‚ù§Ô∏è
As somebody who just lost his dog, thank you for sharing such a wonderful moment. Please give them a hug and an extra boop on the snoot for me
It took me a while to figure out it wasn't a video game cutscene

Dogs are the best.
Wow. Beautifully polished nails. He looks so in love with you. You guys made my day.
I have a picture crazy similar to this with my RottieX. My dopey little buddy ‚ù§Ô∏è
That‚Äôs a dog who looks like he has a great life and pays it back to you. 
There's another pup out there waiting to join you on your journey. There is always another pup in need of a friend and a home. I'm sure he will live on in your memories!
That‚Äôs a dog not a moose

Calling r/shittyHDR
That's a dog though. 
I got this notification on my phone and was so close to sobbing because it didn't have the full post and I thought something awful happened to the puppy. So relieved to be wrong. 

Edit: a word
Did you name a dog Moose? 
I love when dogs just wanna rest their head on you. There's some kind of relationship that people who don't have dogs don't understand. It's pure love
His trust in you shows how good of a human you are to him! I thank you for that! There is nothing better then a soul mate!
What a sweetie üíï gorgeous picture 
Bestest boi right there. Moose should be reserved for stout dogs like yours, and the ankle biters with attitudes as big as a mastiff.
This is so heartwarming,We don't deserve dogs!
[deleted]
I'm just curious,

Did you name him Moose or do you call him that because it's shortened "Maximus" pronounced maximoose?

Because that's the case with my stepdog, Max.
Give him a big hug for me ü§ó
You just won reddit over with a handsome doggo
Sweetheart!
How did Moose die?
Is moose ok?
I want one. So badly.
My dog is dead. 
Mooses are better than people.
What an awesome name for a dog!
His fur is so shiny he looks animated, he's so cute!
This is incredibly moving. 
Good moose 
Maybe I'm looking too far into it but I see a whole lot of symbolism in this photo. A tough looking Rottweiler who automatically has the negative stereotype of aggression, and your tattoos on working hands that show the same stereotype, both coming together to be big softies. Moose is a large, meaty angel and I love him.
#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/HeLsel!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
Good boy!!!
Moose? Thats obviously a bird
this guy trucks
Best boi üò£
Great dog.
Fuck it I'm getting a dog!
He looks like he's got quite a few stories to tell.
That's not a moose???
Goodbye Moose.
I just put makeup on, now I've cried it off. Oh so so sorry
He looks so content
That‚Äôs a Good Boy
Animals are the best. I'm glad you realize how worthy they are of being loved
Beautiful
Just put my baby girl rott down 2 weeks before Xmas...there is no other pain like it.  I hope you're ok!
We are assembled here today to pay final respects to our honored dead. And yet it should be noted that in the midst of our sorrow, this death takes place in the shadow of new life, the sunrise of a new world; a world that our beloved comrade gave his life to protect and nourish. He did not feel this sacrifice a vain or empty one, and we will not debate his profound wisdom at these proceedings. Of my friend, I can only say this: of all the souls I have encountered in my travels, his was the most... human. 

Scene


My pup is also named Moose. And I feel the exact same way about him. I'm glad you've found your companion! 
That is a fantastic head 
Is this painted?
If it is, wow man, good job!
What kind of camera was this taken on? 
I know this post is somewhat old but your dog is beautiful
did he pass?
What a sweet handsome boy! 
I know I‚Äôm very late but I have to say that this picture may very well be my favorite post on Reddit. That paired with your caption just shows to me how strong of a bond you have with your dog, which is something I strive to have with an animal at some point in my life. Every now and then I think about this post and I have to go back and look at the picture again.
Is he dead
Awwww what a handsome devil! Good name too! üòÅ
So is this an RIP post or?
So sorry.  How did he die?
It‚Äôs like he was sent from the heavens to bless your soul.
Don't know if you noticed but that's a dog.
Wow what a perfectly cringy post
D‚Äôaww, he‚Äôs such a big sweet baby! Do me a favor? Give him ear and chin scratches, a big smooch, tell him he‚Äôs be bestest boy and top it off with a high quality belly rub!
Thank you for sharing Moose with us. He is an amazing being - you can almost feel the bond by his paw on your arm. You both are lucky to have each other.üíì
Rotties are such good dogs. 
Seems like there‚Äôs a lot of trust between you two. Awesome picture ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is he dead!? 
He‚Äôs Gorg 
Love the tattoo!
The photo editing is real with this one
Does he browser on Reddit!? What an amazing dog!?
Until those nails ripp my leather seats
They already born with the love we try to find in somewhere else.

I wanna kiss that nose and tell him he's a good boi. ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
Oh god. Shit like this just makes me cry like a goddamn baby. 
[deleted]
I love you, Moose.
Judging by your dog seemingly crying and you saying ‚Äòthank you‚Äô I assumed he was dying and you were on your way to put him down! Apparently the dog is only one years old. Thank god. 
TIL I love Moose. 
You‚Äôre both very fortunate. 
Dogs are just the best. 
PS: Just curious, what's Moose's story and how did you find each other? (Love ya Moose!!!) <3 :) <3
this aint really aww though. it's a cool picture but it belongs more on /r/pics or /r/fuckingawesomedogs or something. moose isn't cute he's badass
Dogs are better than people need I say more
Moose looks like the best co-pilot.
Aesthetic as heck.
Awe yeah 
So sad.... I still tear up thinking about my boy.... he‚Äôs been gone nearly 5 years now 
He‚Äôs beautiful!!  Thanks for sharing 
What a sweet beautiful boy ‚ù§
Rottys are my favorite breed, yours is beautiful! I‚Äôm sure you guys had some great years together.
He's beautiful 
Holy shit he‚Äôs so fucking adorable
How old is moose? I wish I had a dog.

u/ScouseTom420 rip moose
This post hits home and breaks my heart. We had to put our dog down this summer and I still think about him and miss him each and every day. This picture perfectly encapsulates that feeling. That feeling of love and thanks for all the memories we've shared. It's beautiful.
This guy just made 50,000+ panties wet
Until one day it snaps and eats you as you sleep after having devoured your kids 
Moose is the bestest boy.  What a gorgeous pup. 
You captured the love so beautifully in this photo.  
We‚Äôre so lucky that they let us into their lives so completely and they change our lives for the better every day.  
Awwwww

A dog is truly a mans best friend.. this picture is definite proof. 
You are his world <3

New here. How tf does not have any upvotes?
I am the biggest dog fan on the planet, I love dogs more than people and if i won the lottery id foster dogs forever, but Rottweilers have always made me feel uneasy, no idea why, unjustified i know, staff, pitbull, mastiff, german shepherd,I'm fine... Rottweiler, my bollocks restract slightly everytime im near one. :( 
[removed]
Partner?! Sorry I couldn't help myself.
That's not a moose...

*turning super saiyan* THAT'S NOT A MOOSE AT all 
I think I‚Äôm in love with Moose. We had a rotty mix for almost 12 years. Broke my heart to lose him. 
He does a lot of digging? 
That's a dog not a moose
WHAT A BEAUT!!
I got a rottie pup a few months before my daughter was born. They grew up together and were inseparable for many years. She (the dog) was the most gentle, funny, stubborn, and loving family member we could ever have asked for.
I had a moose growing up. He lived to just under 14 years. Cherish him
MOOSE!!!
Is this painted?
If it is, wow man, good job!
Rottweilers. The best!
Damn, he looks like a mystical creature in this. It‚Äôs such a beautiful photo. I have an English Mastiff and a Greyhound. Big dogs have the biggest hearts and are the most gentle. Moose fits him.
Yay tatted up Rottie owners!!!! What is your boy's name? Mine is Panzer, he just turned 4. [https://imgur.com/gallery/N81yA](https://imgur.com/gallery/N81yA)
So long, partner.
He has the face of a good boy and the heart of a golden boy, I'm sure.
I have to ask - I also have a Moose. Is yours a boy or girl? Either way, very cute!!
There is so much love in this picture, wow
Till death do as apart. 
Moose is an excellent boy
Beautiful boy,  looks like an excellent co pilot.  The love of a dog is a blessing impossible to put into words. Sending pets and loves to Moose‚ù§
You can tell that he loves you. If this post is do to his passing, I'm very sorry for your loss
I thought this was a memorial post. Glad to realize Moose is alive and kicking.
T_T
He is so magnificent 

What a beautiful picture 

Blessed to see this! 
You blind or something? That's a dog not a moose
Thank God this picture wasn't going in the other direction! Starred off like it would be tragic.
The black fur right by the toenails....

His foot is like a big chocolate chip cooookie.
What a nice boy
Moose being a bro! ü§ù
This picture is adorable!
Sounds like you truly enjoy your time together. Life is short. Love hard.
Sorry to break it for you, but that's not a moose. It is a very good dog!
Omg what a sweet heart
What an elk you got there! :)
Well someone is cutting onions at work now 
I have a Moose too
The best friend a man could ever ask for is a good dog.  The best dog  breed a man could ever ask for is the Rottweiler, I know from experience twice.  
God damn dude that is a fantastic picture.
There's something about the way a rottie just plops their big head on stuff and looks at you with those big brown eyes that just instantly makes you feel loved. I've had German shepherds, pitties and shibas and non has been more focused on pure love than the rottie.
Rotties really are great dogs.  I'm glad the bad reputation they had in the 80's as mean, killer guard dogs seems to be a thing of the past.

They are loyal, smart, loving gentle giants.  It's a shame they don't live longer than they do, like most larger dogs.

The last two dogs we owned were rotties; best damn dogs we ever had.  Miss them all the time =(
Omg adorable name my friend!!!! 
amazing picture, thank you for sharing such a beautiful moment üò¢
Moose you absolute legend!
Please post more ‚ù§Ô∏è
Damn it. I need to go hug my good boi now. I hate looking at him when I leave, he seems so understanding, but so sad. 
Beautiful...
Mooooooooooooooose!
I don't want to be the one to tell you this, but whoever sold you this moose was very misinformed.
Sweet baby boy
One hell of a photo OP. Print this out into a canvas or a print and frame it.
I had a moose. His back legs randomly got paralyzed and he had to be put down. Love him while you can. 
This made my day. Such an aww moment. 
So cute ‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂
Awww that is AMAZING! God bless you both üòÅ
Hate to break it to you pal but that ain‚Äôt a moose. That‚Äôs a cat.
You can judge a human by the way they treat their animal and you‚Äôve done good my friend. 
This picture is so sweet that it took me a while to realize the size of his head relative to your hand. He looks like a big dog. What size is he?
Dang he‚Äôs a beaut! Give him a pat from me. 
What dog is this? 

Thx bro very cool
I have a black and brown dachshund named ‚ÄúMoose‚Äù love to all the mooses 
Hate to break it to you, but that is not a moose. 
Moose is beautiful but he‚Äôs much safer riding in a kennel!
Oh man, when the paw locks down your arm... you know you‚Äôre giving good pets.
May he rest peacefully, and remember you'll see him again
My doggy soulmate, Ollie, was a Rottweiler mix.  I have an Ollie-shaped hole in my heart, but I wouldn't trade the years I had with him for anything.  Hug your Moose tight.  What a beautiful boy.
Awesome! My boxer was my best buddy also and she passed away this past summer....9 years is not long enough! 
This is so damn wholesome. We dont deserve these awesome creatures 
I just scheduled surgery for my hound to remove a mass on her hind quarters.  May your friend give you more years and joy than you deserve so you can give it back.
My pup is also named Moose. And I feel the exact same way about him. I'm glad you've found your companion! 
Rotties are the most loyal companions you could ask for. My Rottweiler/Labrador mix may look like a deer but he‚Äôs the best dog I‚Äôve ever owned.
This is pretty awesome. My fiancee and I came up with the name Moose for when we finally get to pick up a rottie of our own and I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who loves the name! Beautiful hound and a sweetheart like them all I'm sure.
An absolute fan of how at peace he looks lying next to you.  Always wanted a dog, but unfortunately have pretty bad allergies.  

All the best to you guys.  
Honestly man we don't deserve dogs
Best name. Mine is his namesake. 13yr old boston
This picture is really bad ass

I literally just welled up all sniffly biffly and my co worker asked if I needed a break. 

Yeah, I‚Äôm that fur parent that holds animals to a higher standard over humans haha 
Miss my Sidbo rottie. 
I love rotties. 
There are few bonds stronger than a human and their dog. 


That's a good doggo.
Cute <3
What a great name for your pup

I have not had the pleasure of having one of my own. But I gotta tell ya, dogs are the best darn thing ever.

Wow dude. This is very touching. He looks like a great friend. 
he dog is biutifol

Dogs are really loyal animals and  thats what i think makes them so great so if you treat them nice they treat you nice
That's no moose... That's a good boy :)
Op...I hate to tell you this...but...op...that‚Äôs a dog...I know your love for him will not be affected though!(beautiful creature btw)
Holy crap hes huge! Looks like a great cuddle buddy! 11/10 would give lots of cuddles!
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. I know how hard it must be. Feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to :)
I‚Äôve never had a better friend and companion, myself
Such a special looking fella!!! Life just ain‚Äôt the same without a dog. 
What a good looking dog. I also have a dog named Moose!
I have a pup named Moose as well! He even looks a bit like your Moose!
A SPLENDID BOY
Little small for a moose
I have a Moose too! He‚Äôs a short little lab/basset mix. Your Moose is a beautiful boy :) give him some love from one Moose owner to another 
I want to pet him
Can you give Moose a kiss for me? What a good boy!
Awww! I love him! I miss my baby boy. He is currently in the vet hospital undergoing tests to see what‚Äôs wrong with him. I‚Äôm hoping for good news soon
This is dope. And look at that paw, Moose is a big boy. Awesome name too. Fits pretty well!
This is exactly how I feel about my dog. She and I understand each other in a way that I‚Äôve never experienced before. 
Mooose
What a lucky boy!  I wish I could find a guy to love me as much as you two love each other.  Love how Moose has his paw on you like "This is my human.". üòâ
This makes me miss my pup back home üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è You have one of the goodest boys!
Moose is a good name
Hi Moose I love you 
I love rotties, my first dog (rescue as well) was a rottie and he was a saint! Still miss him :(
What kind of camera?
You know

He said the same thing to you FYI 
OOO SO CUTE I'd get a dog but it scares the shit outta me when they bark I like dogs I'd have to get used to them though 
GREAT photo! That looks like a good doggy. I miss my buddy. 
I seriously thought you were talking about a moose until the the picture loaded
I wish my dog was that calm while riding a car
Want a full pic of the tat. Looks awesome. Doggo is gorgeous. 
Please tell me Moose is alive and well! üò¢
What a dope pic.. the god rays tho!! 
Please tell me Moose is OK.
They really do turn into your best friend
MOOSEY BOY
My cat‚Äôs name is Moose and I love him more than anything in the world. Love from my Moose to yours!
Sometimes when I'm sitting with my dogs, lost in thought. I will start thinking about our relationship. Like, I have 2 four-legged companions that love me more than anything, trust me, just everything. Its just wild. Some of what I say, they understand. Some of what they "say", I understand. Its just crazy to me. I have kids that are a different species. Life is pretty great if youre looking at the correct angles.
Human. My sidekick, my partner, my best friend. 
-Moose
Aww
RemindMe! 1 hour
Stunning picture‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
üíîüíîi‚Äôm so sorry for your loss. 
Where are his antlers?
At first i thought it said a moose sidekicked my best friend...
That's just beautiful. You're so luck and so is he
I‚Äôm sorry for your loss, but hope that reflecting on the good times brings you comfort. We lost our brindle Bull/French mastiff a couple years back. He was our hero. We keep his picture and a few of his things in a place of honor in our house. I had not cried since I was a kid, but sobbed uncontrollably when he was put down. I wish your friend happy trails to the rainbow bridge.
What a beautiful pic!  It captures his love for you.
r/JaredPadalecki 
What a fantastic picture! Gorgeous dog too. 
He looks like a lovely boy. I have a dog shaped lump named Moose trying to lay all over me while I'm typing this.
I love this beautiful bastard
I love him already.
This is a beautiful picture. A+
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Bro, that‚Äôs a dog.
Sorry to tell you but that's actually a Dog, not a Moose. Common misconception.

Like from the office?
An amazing picture, and then I noticed the tear in his eye
Mans best friend!

What kind of breed?
What a bubby! My big bubba isn't too keen on pictures and is just now getting used to the idea of cuddling. He's a goofy boy and a good dog.
Little too much HDR
What dog is this?
You can see the love and trust in his eyes! How adorable!
This makes me want to cry
what a good mooseboi
He looks like a big boi 
My old friend's did was a Rottweiler and also named Moose. That's really cool!
My dog‚Äôs name is moose too! Yours is just as adorable. :)
Put a Patek on his wrist!
Awwww
Okay reddit. What car is it?
I read this as he passed away and so many onions were being cut
I wish my family wasn‚Äôt allergic....

I too have a dog that I love!

Lovely pic

That‚Äôs not a moose! That‚Äôs a dog!
I lost my sweet rottie also named Moose earlier this year to lymphoma. He was really the best dog I‚Äôve ever met. Rottweilers are just absolutely amazing animals and I dream of having another one some day soon. Thank you for sharing a picture of your sweet boy with all of us. 
Rottweilers are amazing friends. I'm lucky to have known one for a while and she was the "momma" to my kids when they were toddlers. 
This photo makes me want to die it‚Äôs so damn cute. What a schweetie bear!!! 
Moose is a good boy! Give him bellytickles from me pls :)
I see posts like this and it makes me hug my dog. sorry for your loss. he looks like a great boy.

I love when they put thier paw on you like that.  
I just got a puppy that we named moose 
Not sure if its the angle of the photo but is he shaped like a bobble head doll?  

I have a boxer/bullmastiff mix who is shaped like a bobble head and its the cutest thing.  He has the head of a bullmastiff but the body of a mid-sized boxer. 

[Here are some pictures of both him and his sister.](https://imgur.com/a/oUyXWuu)
Beautiful!
The bestest moose ever
Big sleepy puppy <3
good boi.
How cute!

That's a good moose specimen. Be careful, though, mooses kill more people than sharks do.
What a beautiful picture. :) Dogs are amazing. We don't deserve them.
Moose the dog, lol. Love it. Reminds me of my daughters stuffed penguin, Duck.
My buddy's name was moose too, well, it was short for Mufasa. He was a pit/boxer mix and made one of the largest impacts on my life. It's gratifying and nalstgic to see someone else also charish the little moments with their overgrown puppy, and to capture it in such a nice shot long distance high five man
Hooman, my sidekick, my partner, my best friend. Thank you for being such an amazing creature.

This is such a great photo.

You have captured the bond between man and animal so well.

This image is relatable on many levels and it's not hard to see why! Good job.
What a good boy
Aw I have a rottie too! Best dogs 
Moose is such a good name. My beagle is named Moose. His real name is Optimus Prime but through the years it turned from Optimus to Opti-moose to Moose and, if he's being my special boy, Moo. 
Great pic man, u can feel the love both ways!
Handsome dog! Also, nice tattoo.
Adam Driver?
Looks like a shot from a video game and it looks amazing. 
This gives me an a deep desire to scratch behind moose's ears. Had a rottie growing up for a few years and she was the best

I LOVE this photo,  there's so much unconditional love.  That's how all love should be.  I'm glad I was raised like that,  like a hippie child,  love and let people be who they are, your're  not going to change them. 
I love how he has his paw on your wrist/arm, as if he wants to hold your hand or affectionately touch you back. (Bad wording but idk how else to say it) 

My dog does it as well and every time he does I ruin it because it just makes me wanna give him a big hug. He loves hugs, and will put his arms around you trying to hug back.

What perfect doggo though :) a handsome fella too. Good boy Moose!
He‚Äôs gorgeous! Is he a pure Rottweiler, or a mix? 
He looks like a Rottweiler. People have no idea how loyal they are. This is a great picture
Is it just me or does this look like it‚Äôs out of a video game?
Get two then you have Meese
Skinny wrist gang 
That's not a mouse. That's a dog. 
awww, the goodest boy ever xoxo
Hes so amazingly handsome. 
PFF, Moose isn't an amazing creature...

He's an incredibly AWESOMELY amazing creature! You can't undersell these creatures like that man!

You can tell in this picture you two have a super strong bond! This picture just WREAKS of "Mans best friend". 

Have an upvote!
That's not a moose
Very touching picture. Beautiful. 
Rest well sweet prince..
That's a big boi. 
What a handsome dog! I am guessing it‚Äôs a boy? What a cutie 
You're welcome.
Your souldog. Rather a dog then a human in my heart any day. I get it Auras my entire world saved me and continues to be the light .
Check out canvas people. Make a canvas of this . Awesome picture
Moose looks tired from being so amazing
This really made my day. Thank you :D!
How do I love another dog after my last dog? It‚Äôs been 20 years and yet I‚Äôm afraid to have another pet for fear of him leaving me again. 
That's a fantastic photograph - I love the way the light is shining in the window.  I'm sorry for your loss - you're in my thoughts during this tough time.
I love Rottweilers; loyal, protective, intelligent goofballs. The best qualities in any living creature man or beast. 
Great pic
I don‚Äôt even know you but this pic legit made me tear up. Glad you both got to experience a great bond together. My condolences, friend
Love me some rotties
how old is he OP? 
Moose looks like a very good boy. Give him a belly rub or ear scratch for me please. 
His eyes look human-like here. Gorgeous photo.

I just went through your posts. You have some amazing shots of that beautiful creature. Right on 
Fresh tears in my eyes for my Teddi- a great soul that was taken too soon.  I'd love to get another Rotti, but don't know if my heart can take it.  I do have a pitt now.
Such a good dog...we all should take the time to thank are dogs for being the most loyal and loving creatures on the planet
How did you justify getting him?

I tell myself I work a lot, I have hobbies, I don't want to have a dog if I'm not going to be around it full time. (I used to work for myself.)

But man, I love animals. And experience says I'm good with them.
I‚Äôve always been afraid of Rottweilers, but Moose looks so sweet and loyal!!
He‚Äôs a good boah 
Cadillac
My kitty's name is Moose! 
Partner?? Something you need to tell us? 
Test
He looks like such a good boah 
Do we deserve dogs? I have a pit bull "a natural born killer" who couldn't be more sweet or loving. got her the day before she was due to be put down. How lucky was I!
Did he die?  That seems like a farewell picture.  
Dogs are the best. I get so much love every day from my little girl. She's special, like your buddy.
What a warm heart-melting photo. I wish you have many more years together. A year ago I met my friend's rottweiler and while I was a bit cautious at first, he turned out to be a total sweetheart that just wanted scratches and play time. In fact, when I first saw him he just flat out ignored me, acted as if I wasn't even there, next morning his head was at my feet waiting for me to get up :). 
He looks like a cuddler.
Man the love for my lil man is unshakeable dog's are truly a man's best friend I love him more than I've ever loved anyone else my lab/Doberman mix. 
Aww. We named our 6 month old German Shepherd Moose. It‚Äôs such a great name for a male dog. Your moose looks like he‚Äôs a great sidekick, just like mine. 
We don't deserve dogs
That was a roller coaster. Definitely thought this was a rip post. 
That dog is fucking spoiled. Lol. I can tell.  I'm the same lol only the finest for my babies. 
I grew up with a rottie who was my not-so-little prince and he was the absolute sweetest doggo ever. Rotties are so amazing. I miss him. 
They really are an incredible breed.
As humans, we don't always deserve the dogs in our life, but it's a look like that from mans best friend that shows, sometimes, WE DO DESERVE THEM.
r/pics
I need to stop fucking around and get myself another dog. I miss having a 4 legged best friend.
Get this printed and frame it for sure man. It's something you'll cherish when hes gone.
Dogs are the most loyal friends.
Thank you for being a friend and not an alpha. :)
How old
I have a 1 year old boxer/st bernard. 
Dogs are just wonderful. I feel no judgment, just love, from my doggy. And he‚Äôs cute and cuddly af
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have me, I have you‚Äù 

Every time my dog has to put his paw on me like that after I put my hand on him that‚Äôs what I think he‚Äôs saying 
So cute! 
Are you sure you're not his sidekick?
Great picture
beautiful post
Thank you
Moose is gonna get so much karma when he dies
He's your muse! üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è

HI MOOOOOSEY!
Rotts are the fucking best.
Mutual love
He looks like a lovely dog, I bet it was nice knowing him.
Beautiful Good Boy 
Good boy, Moose! 
Hold him tight. I lost the best boy ever suddenly 3 months ago. Have had dogs all my life, but nothing like [him](Omar & the Man https://imgur.com/a/9GdWKj6). He saved my life. I cry every day. Imma adopt an old girl or boy when I'm ready...if I ever get there. Give him a big kiss and hug for me please. 
Omg he looks so adorable and sleepy 
Take care of him, he's worth it 
Such a beautiful boy!
/r/redditgetsdrawn
What a beautiful baby. He needs to be in an oil painting he's so beautiful. What a good boy üò≠üò≠
He's magnificent 
NGL I saw the title before anything else and assumed it was gonna be a RDR2 horse post 
Awesome friend he must be üòò
Love the look of your tattoo, can we see the whole thing? 
What a beautiful guy!
Oh my god, I thought this was his final picture! I'm so glad I came to the comments. Enjoy that good boy for many more years to come! 
I don‚Äôt know you and you don‚Äôt know me but if, In fact, Moose is going to doggy heaven may peace be in your and his hearts. Dogs change our lives and are here for that reason. I hope you do get another one. You will find a new best friend. I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you. Try to have happy holidays. Take care
Rotties are the best. 
So much love in just one photo
Just curious, does anybody know  what kinda truck that is?
I feel stupid. I thought the dog had died, or was soon to die. I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs okay. Poured my heart out for a cute photo. 
He looks like such a sweet boy 
Isn't that a dog?
This doggo would the Wise Sage But Misunderstood doggo in a children's movie. 10/10 give pats from me plz
Loves daddy 
Did he die cause it‚Äôs all in past tense:(
I had a bio teacher w a dog named moose and tattoos on her arms lol
Human pets AND a warm spot with sunshine? This dog is having the best day of his life yet.
I had one when I was little he was my best friend he jump the fences and wait at my bus stop for me every day after school and would walk me to the bus stop as well he was with me 24/7 when I was home and when I was sick in the hospital my dad had to bring him to see me everyday and he never wanted to leave me and when he got old and got cancer I made my family do everything they could for him but after a wile he did pass and people say they are the most mean dogs ever but people need to Realise that it not the dog it the people that raise them no dog is bad it how people raise them and if I can one day get another one when I have the right space for it to get exercise and place for him or her to call home and seeing this beautiful girl so happy and loving that all that matter ...and she a really beautiful and I miss my buddy Buford but when you find a animal like that they will be you best friend till the end
