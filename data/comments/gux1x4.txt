Awwww. My cat tried to hide in my jacket last time she had to go to the vet too its so sweet and I felt so bad for having to betray her a minute later.
Awww poor kitty, daddy save me!
That 'aw shucks' look on his face at the end as he lovingly cups his arm/hand around her is so sweet. He is just as smitten as his kitten!
She clearly loves her human! Hope all went well at the vet.
Our cat hates going for her annual check up at the vet. One year while my wife was 8 months pregnant with our first child, we took our cat together. While we wanted for the vet in the exam room, our cat decides to hide under my sweatshirt. The vet comes in, comments "Someone looks pregnant" and I died laughing as I couldn't tell if he was referring to myself or my wife. Turns out he didn't notice my wife's bump and was talking about me.
Is that Destin?
Cat logic: if they can't see you, you can't see them
Daddy melted
This video makes me want to have a cat
Let me just slink over here, no one will find me.
welp she won the internet today for me, congrats!
I love cats
God I hate the feeling I get when I have to take my pet to the vet. Legit can't even sleep the night before because it stresses me out. Poor thing. Hope she's alright!
Mine gets back in the box that brought him there.
Mine goes between my legs. And will meow until I kneel down so he can do that.
Aww sweety, Daddy will protecc!
My little guy used to do the same thing at the vet. He was always a love at home but it was things like that always confirmed he saw me as a source of comfort and safety. I miss that little goobey so much.
The way she slinks over there! ♡

The chestburster went back in! This is a new one! I’m totally a xenologist (Xenomorph Scientist)
That's adorable. My cat chose to hide behind the computer monitor. Both doors were locked, so I thought he disappeared into thin air, until I looked at the counter and saw a tiny black and white face with bright green eyes looking back. He's a nervous cutie.
It always makes me so sad when our kitties go limp at the vet. It’s gonna be okay!!
My dog is large and tries to hide behind me or under the one chair in the room. If that doesnt work she gets in the corner and goes boneless.
Surprised Conan O’Brien likes cats
That’s so precious
My Oreo does that too. It's like the closer he gets the more invisible he is.
That dude looks a lot like u/MrPennywhistle
Omg who’s the guy?!
That guy is soooo cute tho. i am in love with a guy i will never meet, again lmao
Why is the cat on a cold metal table? We put mats and towels down at my place. Classic cat wants to hide! So cute
*I will be safe under here, this man is such a dear*😻
r/cuteguyswithcats
so cute
I wish my cat would do that, instead of the top of my head.
His reaction!! He was SO touched...which is just so adorable!
STEALTH 100
Aw
Poor baby. Lots of hugs for the puddy meows.
He feels s n u g g
Awwwww, No relate much but I have bring mah pup to the vet one and he also does this adorable action to me.
Lovely❤
Poor baby.

I wish my cat did that. Instead mine turns into a demon cat. Teeth and claws.
“Vet no see me sneak and in the dark, vet won’t get a peek.” - cat, maybe
I keep getting too many riot and protest posts. I needed to see this.
Literally a scaredy cat....very cute.
That's a big cat, holy shit!
I always bring a jacket to the vet, just to make a tent for my kitty.
Nervous young infelines
I bring a cat bed for mine, and she'll sit there (relatively) happily rather than try to escape.
Awww your kitty looks like my kitty!!!!
So cute, it totally looks like me at hospitals haha
Warm and dark, just how I like it.
My senior cat does this too. He hates the vets and has to hide somewhere either in my jacket or in the cat carrier. 

It’s sweet too see the cat going to into his human’s jacket as a place of safety and comfort.
Dad, are you going to do something about this?
Sweet baby, I love the way they think they’re hiding and can’t be seen!
NFC!
Such a sweet moment. It can really make your heart grow exponentially when anxious animals take comfort in their humans at the vet. My 2-year old cat hides behind my legs every time.
I could watch this all day.
oh lawwd, he slinkin'
Cat was saying Peace! Im out. Hes no dummy, knows the person in the white coat coming to get him.
Exactly what my cat do at the vet. Hiding ass boy.
Awwww it looks just like my babygirll!!!! And she’s so scaredy too!!! 😭 😭
I have rats, who do not give one of their own asses about me, unless I am feeding them or horrifying them by removing them from their cage for cleaning.

But when I had to take one of them in, the vet examined her, and she was scared and struggling the whole time in the doctor's hands. When the vet let go, she immediately ran up the sleeve of my sweatshirt, something she has never done before.

I bet that owner felt the same special feeling I did. It feels really amazing when a frightened animal comes to you for comfort. I know that sounds creepy, but I work in vet med, so that feeling is hard to come by.
All hail the cavernous coat.
squish that cat
Me in 2020
We dont deserve cats
That cat is all of us right now.
This is just the sweetest. This has been exactly me for the past few days. But, where’s my human in his well worn Carhartt jacket to weather through this with?
Why am I a little jealous of that cat right now?! Her owner is very cute!
I don’t know that dude but the cat crawling to him for safety made him 100x hotter
AWWWW😍💞🌹
Awwww nobody likes the Vet.  Poor kittay!! 

Big kitty!!!
My cat would be running everywhere and freaking the fuck out
Awww. Because of covid, today when I brought my Tiddles to the vet I was worried it would be hard for her without me there, but the vets said she was great, affectionate, and even jumped up on the table for them! Now I'm wondering if pets only ham it up like this when the owner is present.
This is so cute, I could squeal. Poor scared kitty!
I remember taking my most ballsy, annoying cat to the vet. He hid behind my mom and tucked himself into the corner the best he could. I love cats.
Mine hid right in the trash can
I always leave the carrier on the table. It opens on the top, front, and side. So he can hide in it while still accessible to the vet.
I will never get why vets use those tables.  Cold, hard metal *can't* be comfortable for the animals.
Vet Man can’t find me in here.
My sweet child
Looks like Snake from the original Degrassi! Does anyone else see it?
Papa protection
It's almost like kitty can see the ghosts of all the animals that didn't make it :(
My  cat does the same thing. If I take her to the vet I wear a hoodie instead of putting her in a carrier.  She will crawl around inside the hoodie making her way to the sleeve and pop her head out.
My big monster always hides behind me like somehow I'm able to hide his fluffy orange fur and fat butt from view. Love him!
wow so wholesome
Looks like my boy Destin ?
The cat loves and trusts her owner. It’s a beautiful relationship of mutual benefit to both. The pet dad is a kind man.
lol - both my cats do that shit at the vet (even without the jacket though, they just try and curl up as small as possible against my stomach)
The angle makes it look like the kitty is crawling inside his body.  It’s like David Cronenberg got into making cute cat videos.
One of mine on her last vet visit climbed on my shoulders. The vet couldn't stop laughing, and insisted we do the check-up with her in my shoulders, since it was obviously her safe space.
Dad: Hi it's me destin, from smarter every day.
Awww, poor kitty but also so cute. My cat is super nervous when we go to the vet too so I have to put her favorite blanket in her crate and she just stays under it and the vet tries to do what they need to do without taking her out.
That must be one reassuring coat
Is that the guy from Smarter Every day??
Safety
He looks like Todd(?) from Breaking Bad
One of my cats does the same thing. I usually try and wear a nice but puffy coat when I go cuz I know he's going to try and hide in my coat.
My cat does the exact same thing. Except I don’t have clothes for her to hide in. She kinda just curls into my chest and hopes the vet doesn’t see her.
Is that Destin from smarter every day?  Certainly looks like him in the blip you could see him.
Sweet kitty.
So cute
Mine does the same, it's too cute!
Hide in my hoomans coat. Low to ground. Hooman with needle can't see me. Yes yes. Will work.
"There should be no place for heterosexuality
My little girl just hisses and swats at everyone in the room when she's on that table, myself included
Awwwww sweetie
Get a dog. They are actually capable of affection.
Very nice hidey spot
Aww my kitty would do that to me to at the vet
So cute
Don't be suspicious, don't be suspicious..DON'T BE SUSPICIOUS
Yep, I remember the time I took my generally-nervous cat to the vet for her annual on a particularly cold winter day. I only wear my ski jacket on really cold days (or, y'know, when skiing). My girl was happy to be completely covered by said jacket on the exam table while waiting for said vet.
aww softie, but even daddy can't save you from the needles!
That's so cute!
So cute!
My vet has these little benches to sit on while they work with your pets and my cat always tries to crawl between my back and the seat. It's so cute but I feel so bad for him
Kitty in jacket at vet. Kitty in jacket at vet! KITTY IN JACKET AT VET! KITTYINJACKETATVET!!!
I want a Schnoodle 🥺
That guy looks like the better every day guy.
My heart would melt. A
Yup
My cat does this at the vet! She doesn’t cuddle at home, but at the vet she always tucks herself into the nook of my arm and it’s so cute.
It’s like a reverse chestburster scene from “Alien”!
I wish my cat did taht
 Looks almost exactly like mine, different face though.
Please build a human size one, for me.
Is that Destin from smarter every day?
Opps.. No...
Kind of makes me wonder if exam tables have to be so stark and isolated without even a wall to make cats feel more secure.  I mean you could hardly design something to make cats feel **more** uncomfortable than a cold bare metal table surrounded by nothingness.
What breed is he or she
r/catdimension
That's his invisibility cloak. It doesn't work for humans.
My cat also does this at the Vet office 😭 mines a cute fluffy Tuxedo cat!
Looks like my cat but with a shorter tail! I have a tuxedo main coon.
That's how i feel right now
The reverse xenomorph. Pops out his mouth and dives into a salad in a few days.
Aw his smile tho he loves his kitty :)
Just baby
If I was lost or scared, having my kitty would make me feel so much better. Glad to see that for this kitty, her person makes her feel better.
Aw little bubba
That's so adorable..
Hide me daddy.
Casually army crawling int a jacket to plan his getaway!
he doesnt look Nervous
You can’t see me you can’t see me you can’t see me
SO PRECIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Having your cat come to you when they’re scared like that is the most amazing feeling I’ve ever experienced. 

Almost makes me want kids 
Almost.
Lol
> That’s comforting but still sad
Aww poor baby, this reminds me of the time I picked my little buddy up from the vet for his teeth cleaning. I guess he was being fussy with the vet because they asked me to come back there. He came out of the corner and let me pick him up pretty quick. He was done with that place lol.
I lost my sweet girl Friday night, just two weeks shy of her 1st birthday. She was always so nervous at the vet and would always go back in her carrier or curl up behind me so I'd keep the vet away. Always made me feel bad to betray her and hand her over.

[My brave girl after getting blood drawn for a test.](https://i.imgur.com/friVsUW.jpg)
Cats only act like they don't give a fuck at home, because they feel safe :)
My old guy does this every time; sticks his head as far up my jacket sleeve as he can get it. 

Doesn't do him any good, though. His back half is still readily available for a rectal thermometer and a good bladder palpitation - poor fella.
Is that the dude from, "Smarter every day?"
Why do animals have such fear of the vets? They dont have a concept of medicine and every vet I've ever met has been remarkably kind to animals even if they were getting hissed at etc, as you would expect. It's like they know some animals go there to die yet the place is supposed to be sterile. I wonder if they can smell something disturbing left behind or maybe they are reacting off their owners anxiety?
Poor baby 😭
Pre covid world.

Had to put down my 18 year old cat in the parking lot last week after waiting while they put down a dog while everybody else at the vet that day was there in the parking lot. 

Made an unpleasant experience even worse.
Aw, indeed! That guy is so blessed to be his comforting space. <3 :) <3
Such a sweet kitteh.
My kitty hated being in a kitty carrier, strongly resisting being put in it, then crying to be let out during the whole drive to the vet.  Then when we got there, she cowered from the doctor in the one place she knew: the kitty carrier.
Nice
Is that Destin from Smarter Every Day?
Nice
Awww. When I being my cat to the vet I put him in his small dog harness (because when you have 17 pounds of purring cat even even an XL cat harness doesn’t fit) and he only rides in the carrier for the short car ride. As soon as we get there I clip on his leash and tuck him into my coat and grab his towel. 

All the staff go crazy over him like they’ve never seen a grown man tuck an cat into his coat before. 🤷🏻‍♂️
You never feel as trusted & loved by your cat as when they are at the vet. Most of the time, it’s feed me! Pet me! Why are you touching me? My cat, who I had to PTS in January 2017 was very anti social but always glued herself to me at the vet. I miss her and her brother  🌈 🐾
Cracking stuff

Jeez about 5 hours ago I had to took my cat to the vet to put her down, she was pretty old but was the prettiest cat I had ever seen. She really was a joy in the house. I saw this post and all those emotions flooded in again from a couple of hours ago. This vet looks like the place where we put her down. :(
Ive seen this happen. Our cats are very not so fond of vet either.
Awwwwww, that's super cute.
At the vet my tiny dog would climb up my body onto my head or inside my body if she could find a way lmao
I assume that cat is a stray cat
Is that Kerrick?
Wholesome 100
Me crawling back into my basement be like..
Awww, our Lily usually tucks her face in my armpit.
The environment was probably just too unfamiliar. 

Cats are (too endearing) animals of habit and the "usual".
I saw that jacket at the edge of the frame and I wanted to crawl into it too. Sometimes I feel like I’m more cat than person because all of my instincts dictate I should behave exactly how a cat would in most comfort/fear/playful scenarios
I wish my cat did this at the vet. She turns into Satan and just hisses and tries to bite and scratch anyone who goes near her. I even have a kitty straitjacket that I have to put her in before I put her in her carrier. As soon as we’re home she turns back into the sweetest and cuddliest cat but I worry every single time that she won’t change back and I’ll be stuck with a growling demon forever.
How nice!

Do all cats instinctively scared of the vet?
Awwww, this reminds me of something my cat did when I first brought him home. He got a little sick immediately after coming home (this was when he was a kitten, apparently it's a common thing) and I took him to the vet to get checked. They rook him in the back to get his blood work done. When they brought him back and put him in the exam table, the poor little 3lb guy literally ran on shaky legs to me and curled in a tiny ball against my stomach, all scared and shaken up :(
I love his smile! Very adorable interaction.
so cute <3 :\*
My cat bit the vet.
What a beautiful silky looking cat!
One of my cats jumped onto the counter where the vet keeps their supplies, and then pushed his way behind them so he could hide
aw was that the kitty’s first visit ?
Awww
My dog does the same thing, basically tries to climb into my arms.
This is so cute
I wish  I could do the same when I go to the dentist
My heart 😭😭😭😭
This is the exact definition of this sub.
cute
This is healthy masculinity
England: That’s comforting but still sad
Poor cat knows he is going to get probed 😱
Still an aww moment, but at least trim it so you can't see the cat being pushed at first. It literally slides over the counter at the beginning.


I'm guessing it did this once and they decided to recreate it. So, unhappy cat, and the vet decides to make it unhappy again in order to video it. Otherwise r/whyweretheyfilming
Awwwww babyyyyy. <3
Yeah I can't believe I found the kitty!”
Wahhhhh I want a cat, people are so lucky to have pets. My landlord won’t let me. Boo
Cats like caves.
I thought she had a little kitty mask on aww 😍
I love you both!
Sweet kitty... this is so cute!!
Cutie
There has to be a cursed comment somewhere around here.
This is what my cat does!
Me when i am introduced to new relatives that  i had never seen before
If I can’t see you, you can’t see me. lil Garfield there, give him some lasagna
“I can’t see you, you can’t see me.” 😂
i am now at the vet,

it’s no fun, you bet!

but i wanna be healthy, i wanna be neat,

i’ll be good for once and get a treat!
That's so sweeeeet
Awww so cute
My kitty does that every time we go to the vet. He even tries it when I'm wearing a t-shirt and not a jacket or sweater.
Hold on a moment, is that Ellis from left 4 dead 2?
Why are cats so afraid of vets?
Awwww, the poor baby! This melted my heart, I want to give him a big cuddle. I hope he feels better!

Aww he went for the pp
Serious awwww there.  But damn that's a huge cat.  Is it a Maine Coon?

This reminds of my old dog! She was a saluki cross, so once up on the examination table she was pretty tall! She would always hide her face in my armpit, and I mean ram her face in there and keep it there whilst the vet examined her.

God I miss that dog
Why kitties are more scared from vets than any other pet . (It rhymes)
CAT: come on buddy let's go home I promise to be good at home
Cats are the best!
My cat does the same thing. On one hand it makes me feel so loved, while on the other it makes me feel like a horrible person for taking her to the vet.
Aww! Bubba. ❤️
This cat speaks for all of us rn
It really gets to you when an animal as fiercly independent and not very trusting as a cat comes to you for security and a place to feel safe. It takes extreme patience and lots of attention to gain thier trust. Every night without fail, as soon as i roll over on my side to sleep, no matter where in the he is in the house, within 1 minute,  ive got a 23 lb cat for a pillow. A lot of the time hes just staring at me waiting for me to roll over.

You can get a spray that calms them down, or maybe catnip, before you go in.

Cats get very stressed in a new environment.
My cat is the same way, she will jump off onto my lap or hide in the corner or under my chair.
*starts sucking*
Precious baby.
Don’t be suspicious don’t be suspicious
Mine climbed between my sweater and my jacket, I still had my backpack on so he was stuck there. The vet ended up sort of peeling my cat off of me. Cats fine though - turned 3 yesterday!
Exactly why when you’re working with a kitty, you try your best to block them in with their butt to your belly, and your arms at either side boxing them in!
Awwww.... what a great feeling...!
My cat transforms into a tiger when he go to the vet. They have to put him in a cage in order to manipulate him
Welcome back to Smarter Every Day
I adopted a playful and loving little skinny tabby kitten last month.  I love her so much, but a small part of me wishes she was a big fat lazy maine coon/furry kitten.
And the guy is so sweet
My dog hides his face against me as if he thinks the vet won’t see him.
Both my bois are so good at the vet. The best thing I do is take the top off their carrier. One of them burrows so he has a baby blanket. The vet just works around it so he can stay under. The other just loafs. Neither struggle or make noise or fight. Even for eyedrops and ear drops. 


Whats funny is the one who burrows is one that makes some of the vets nervouse he's mix ragdoll short hair so hes just a large black cat. Like 15lbs but not overweight(vet confirmed). They always think he will fight so like two assistance and the vet are there ready to restrain. But then he just lets them do anything. Funniest thing I saw was when they took him to the back for labs the lady just walked him around under her arm like a football with his legs hanging down. And they always comment about how quiet they are. 

When I dont have crate he presses up agiast me. Not sure what I do to make them such good bois.
My mom's cat does the same. His nose and the inside of his ears turn bright pink as well, the vet says he's blushing.
If it fits, he sits: a comment thread
This looks like the guy from the top post in r/confidentlyincorrect

reddit.com/r/confidentlyincorrect/comments/guk3e6/ill_forgive_this_man_for_his_attitude_alone/
'now take me back home'
Mine does the same, except I don't usually wear jackets. She just puts her head between my arm and my hip, or against me in general, and I don't know if she thinks she I'd hidden of if she just feels safer, but the vet can do the whole consult like this (except for eyes, ears and mouth checkup ofc) and she won't react
This is what my cat did too
Isn't this destin from smarter every day?
aww
Aaaww this is so cute I wanna punch something
ha haa. he won't find me in here. 
will he dad. 
 dad dad you traitorous bastard you
Awww my cat climbs on my shoulder and digs her claws in, she's not cuddly at all in any other situation and is extremely timid, she doesn't like to be picked up, and only likes being stroked on her own terms. But at the vets all of a sudden she's the most cuddly thing ever with me.

I now have a big male cat, and once the lockdowns are over and we can bring him in for a checkup, I have yet to see what he's like since he's friendly with everyone, but very timid.
That is adorable :) My cat does the same thing as he hates the vets (he has good reason: they took blood, messed up his surgery to fix his broken leg and then had to have it removed), so now whenever we go to the vets (different to the one that messed up) he'll just hop over to my with his body low to the ground and push himself into me and hide his face if he can. Makes me feel so bad whenever I then have to push him away so the vet can check him over.

If anyone wonders: he does fine with 3 legs :) He's had more of his life with only 3 legs than with 4, and he still climbs up fences etc.
I bring a blanket from home that my cats like to lay on, use it for comfort in the crate and bring it out and put it on my lap for them to hide in while we wait for the vet, then use it on the exam table. Definitely helps comfort my kitties in stressful times.
Baby loves a da da
Destin?! Is that you?
My cat did the same thing!! So adorable
I feel bad for what the cat had to go through
Haha reminds me of my chonker hiding his head in the crook of my arm and thinking that he’s completely hidden.
Dis is epic
I feel like r/aww has been that jacket with all that's going on reddit right now.
how sweet it is :)
I have a cat that looks exactly like this except he has a white spot like right of the center of his back.
Take my upvote😍😍
I mean vets to animals are the human equivalent of being abducted by aliens. Strange cold metal place with weird species trying to shove shit up your asshole and poke you with stuff before returning you home.
You call that pre-historic looking creature a kitty? I'm more kitty than it is and i'm a hairy dude.
Heartbreaking! 😔x
We're lucky, our current cats LOVE the vet.  I had two of them in there at the same time a few months ago, and while the vet was trying to check one cat, the other one started head-butting her arm and purring at her.  It was hilarious.  (She's also a great vet, which makes it a lot easier for them to be comfortable.)

My previous cat, though, would often curl up on my jacket in a corner, if he could, or he'd crawl into the carrier if I forgot to close it.  Poor guy.
Awww. My cat does a similar thing with my hair. I leave my hair down when we go to the vet so if I’m holding him in my arms, he can “hide” in it. Ends up looking like Fabio though lol
You can tell that's a wholesome owner.
My cat did this with me when we took her to the vet because she had a growth on her face (harmless cyst thankfully!) Normally she'll go to my husband because I'm the one that has to hold her still for inspection and injection.
Cats are pretty independent, but they *definitely* look to their humans for comfort and protection.
AAWWW. My dog Molly does that with me too
Cat is 10/10 about to do a low meooooooooowwwwwwww
If I move slowly no one will notice me leave. 

 Nothing to see here.....
Can I crawl in there too? I’m a nervous kitty and shit’s wild AF out here
Mia does this every time we go to the vet. The only way she’ll be compliant with the vet is if I’m holding her, or else she’ll become a hissing and spitting mess.
I would've done the same let's be honest
You look like one of my buddies who’s name is Johnny. Is ur name Johnny?

Kitties are really adorable friends...smart too. They know what's going to happen when they are at the vet's. It's really sad I have to betray her for her own good. It breaks my much as much as it breaks hers.
Aww. My cat tries to melt into the crook of my arm at the vet. She does not like to have her temperature taken.

My guinea pig did this at the vet. It was the first time same showed me any affection at all. She was fine. Just fat. And pregnant.
That's so cute my girlfriend sent me this

Oh, that's so cute.
