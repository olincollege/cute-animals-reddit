I just hurt my neck mimicking this bird.
r/PartyParrot
I want to feel what birb feels
This is me when the ungodly amount of food I ordered arrives.
Is this what they do in preparation for feeding another bird?
What does this mean? Is the bird happy, content, or something else?
I want those emotions irl. Fucking adorable bird.
Pet birds are like the Crackhead pets. Case in point: this clip, and Parakeets.
What a jiggly cute snow ball!
*minecraft parrot intensifies*
the closest thing I have to a cute bird like dis is a neighborhood crow that screams at me when I check the mail
Fuck I wish my birds were this cute. All my little bastards do is talk behind my back
Wiggle wiggle wiggle *insert music*
QUICK someone re-gify this with the Jason Derulo song wiggle, wiggle, wiggle...
*inside the bird‚Äôs head when they do that*

‚ÄúSHE‚ÄôS A MAAAANIAC, MAAAAANIAAAC!!!‚Äù
Omg he dancin
I NEED someone to make this a gif that just infinitely repeats. Please, I need BIRB.
u/vredditdownloader
Whatcha gonna do with that big fat fluff? WIGGLE WIGGLE WIGGLE
Jason Derulo:
This is what a bird does when preparing to regurgitate for its young. The owners trained it to do it on command after seeing the natural behavior and rewarding it.
r/Birbs
It went full Muppet.
I'm kinda glad that birdy is not mine as I would kiss him all day he's so gorgeous
This is me 4 beers in on a Friday night.
A lil boogie
What kind of bird is this. Anyone knows?
The ol‚Äô razzle dazzle
Birbs do be vibing 24 7
He's a 'guring!
Is this a love bird? Or a parrotlet
Okay Jason Derulooo

rooBobble
who played the cds in minecraft that makes them dance
What type of bird is this?
He‚Äôs doing the conor mcgregor pre fight warm up
Parrots in minecraft going in and out of the music area of the jukebox
Omg they made the thing from minecraft into a rela thing
You must have a jukebox nearby.
Me when Sea Shanty 2 is playing
Me Dancing when i'm drunk
I'm kinda glad that birdy is not mine as I would kiss him all day he's so gorgeous
This is the cutest thing but does anyone know what this means in terms of bird body language
MINECRAFT PARROT?
He moves like Bear from the old kids show "Bear in the big blue house"
Bird has learned "Silly Wiggle" emote
I'm sexy and I know it.
I can hear that bird saying..."Wasssssup"!!
I love that wiggle! I can only assume it's the way that keets express an overload of happiness/excitement!
What's its name?
haha birb go w^(i)g^(g)l^(e w)i^(g)gl^(e w)i^(g)g^(l)e
You know what ta do with dat "big" blue birb!.... Wiggle wiggle wiggle.

Edit: I love how he/she has its lil beak ready for its reward before it even started the neck wiggle
Birb is actually sensitive to gravitational waves
I just went a little dizzy from trying to imitate the bird's wiggling.....
Did you put a disc in the jukebox?
Don't know why but this reminds me of spongebob squiggles
Dammmnnn so cute! <3
just like the rainbow reddit bird!
Wat does this meannnn
/u/vredditshare

/u/vredditshare
My budgie hates me :(
r/PartyParrot material
Mmm, yes, regurgitate that food. 
Obviously a well taken care of parrotlet if it's so eager to share love-puke with it's human.
This feels like it needs a Lil John background music.
Aww look at da wiggle TT
Looks so funny
IKEA BIRD!!

I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that. I'm in tears lol
Somebody stop that bird! Oooo
Parrots in minecraft when music plays:
D'Lo brown the bird.
Oh. My. Lawd. This is the cutest thing I've seen all week.
I wish I had a cute bird like this. My stupid parakeet keeps biting my neck and ear. And then he protests if I get angry. He‚Äôs a little shit. I still love him. My wife doesn‚Äôt understand why though, neither do I.
DODODODODOODOOODOOO
YO QUIERO
When my mum was little she had a budgie named Wiggle. He was named Wiggle because he did. I wonder if this what he was doing that got him his name
Why does it do this?
u/vredditdownloader
... Uh!
I too, wiggle when receiving and eating food
Homie ain‚Äôt got a care in the world
So cute
Must be an Indian in the past life
Little shake and wiggle, all the ladies can't resist
Reminds me of that one video with Seokjin's rant edited over üòÇ
i have a lovebird too
Put that Pigstep in the Jukebox, Mr Zombie!!!
I wanna upvote this multiple times
Love how he says ‚Äúwow‚Äù after the first one. He knows how badass he looks üòé
I wish my budgie went on my shoulder
Ready, Steady, Wiggle!
Sweetie ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I mean he‚Äôs/she‚Äôs basically a stripper you give him something and they do whatever dance you want
The bird must have gotten into the catnip again.
I really wish I had a wiggly white puffball on my sholder.

(Notes down in the "things to get when I am independent" list)
IT‚ÄôS SO CUTE I SCREAM EVERY TIME IT WIGGLES

Alright, who did a little wiggly dance in return?
How cute
I've seen this before in other budgies why do they do this?
Now I need a pet bird just because I want it to do that all the time.

What a cute bird!
I like this
Lmao this is adorable
I thought it was only what Minecraft parrots did, but they do this in real life? xD

Don't they do that when they regurgitate food?
 When you turn on jukebox in minecraft

Minecraft irl?
That almost rekindled my desire for a bird. We had one growing up and my little brother was always in trouble so she would say "marco come here Marco come here! Thank you God." she said other things too and was a really sweet little thing but birds live a long time and we already have 10 pets and i just cannot juggle anything else right now. Lol

I love him
The numbers weren't for individuals, it was funny!!

This made me feel warm and fuzzy in my heart
Lol
Me, entering the dance floor:
That s accurally what they do to initiate mating. 
(I have two of these little cuties an they do it all the time)
He got them moves like Jagger
This is why I love birds
Doesn't this mean he's gonna puke? My parrot did that same wiggle, then regurgitated on my chest.
u/VRedditDownloader
Watched this while listening to the guitar solo in 'Free Bird' 10/10 would synchronise again
that's cute

Wow loving
Do parrots and other pet birds have their own personality? Or do they all act generally similar? Like dogs of the same breed will wreak havoc and other will be chill.
Does the same apply to birbs?
r/vredditdownloader
Would it feel bad if it's human does not eat the stuff he regurgitates?
When you play music in minecraft
Quick, someone dub in wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle, yeah.
