I was interning at a post production house in the city and Peter was there doing voice over work. I was sitting in the front office unaware that he was even in the studio when he popped out to use the phone. I was star struck and as he was waiting for someone to pick up noticed me staring and waved awkwardly. I waved and said "Just want to say.. I'm a big fan." And he smiled and started chatting on the phone and I sat there with my head in shame because I knew the front office fulltimers would scold me for talking to the talent. But after Peter was done on the phone he walked right over to me and gave me a big smile, shook my hand and introduced himself. He asked me about my internship and work. He was so kind and charming and wished me luck and said he appreciated me telling him that I was a fan.

He is an awesome guy.
How else would you carry a little lion?
As a dwarf myself, I worried so much about being able to carry kids.  I still worry about babies, but after babysitting my cousins and swinging them into my lap by their arms and dragging screaming kids into the kitchen for dinner, my concerns about being physically able to care for a child are significantly curbed.  I am certain I've toted an exploding toddler this way before and I wonder if anyone looked on in horror.
A bunch of us were driving home from a yarn/wool festival in upstate NY a few years ago, stuck at a light in town, and saw an adorable baby trying to pick up a leaf. We all noticed at the same time that the dad was Peter Dinklage and momentarily lost our minds with excitement. If you‚Äôre reading this sir, I promise we were staring at the cute baby first.

Edit: It was in Rhinebeck, which is upstate to us Long Islanders, and yes my user name does indeed check out üòÇ
Someone correct me if I'm wrong but isn't he very private and doesn't want to have his kids in the entertainment industry/ photographed, I think even he didn't even reveal his daughters sex. I want to say I heard this on Joe Rogan.
Every time I see GOT I am so glad that Peter Dinkledge was there for that role.  It is a difficult and complex role that would be very hard to cast even if the entire acting world was available to choose from, that the part was for a dwarf would make it a near impossibility.  I am sure that he had more range than his typecasting would suggest but I am still pretty sure that Billy Barty  would have ruined the show.
I'd still love to see a House, M.D. reboot starring Dinklage as Gregory House's smarter brother, Shed.
Before Game of Thrones had come out on HBO, I spotted him in NY and I totally geeked-out having been a big fan of "The Station Agent".
I regret not having the courage to approach him to let him know how much I enjoyed his movie. 
I read recently that her name is not known, and the fact she was a girl was not known for quite a while.
Every father should have some ridiculous ways of carrying their children. My personal fav is dad pinning the child to his side, hand cupped under the child's waist, with the child's head facing the rear.  Makes me think "Come on, kid. Time ta go."

&#x200B;

Edit: changed from a fact to my opinion. 
Here's his daughter [with her baby Peter Dinklage.](https://i.imgur.com/ID29mZq.png)
Has she inherited dwarfism? Apologies for ignorance, I know dwarfism isn‚Äôt one single condition and I don‚Äôt know whether it‚Äôs possible for a parent with dwarfism to have a child without.
Cheers
She's a cute little Dinklet.
When the girl will be in age and people start asking "And what your daddy do for a living?"

She could genuinely respond "He drinks and knows things." 
I worked on a movie with him a couple years ago, and his wife and daughter are just the sweetest people ever.

Peter was also super awesome, and took a genuine interest in the crew and their interests!

Wonderful people all around.
Met him when his first girl was born in NYC hospital... my first son was born at the same time we raced baby carts down the hall (slowley) making vrooom vroom noises.
*hopefully* his daughter. 
This is 200% wholesome 
[deleted]
I get the feeling he would hate seeing this picture up here. Peter Dinklage has been extremely protective of his children‚Äôs privacy, refusing to release their names and even genders when being born.
Will always upvote Mr. Dinklage
is there any biological reason or logical answer as to why men develop that potato-sack hold when they become dads?
Its cute, but be aware that this was taken by a paparazzi photographer, so while youre not giving them money, youre still encouraging awful behaivior
Peter will always have my respect. I am a hospice nurse, and in December he sent a signed poster to one of my patients with her name and the inscription "It's not easy being drunk all the time, if it was easy everyone would do it." My patient told me the saddest part of dying for her was she would miss the coming season of GOT. I like to think maybe she is getting to see it early. She loved the poster and it made her laugh. Good on him. 
Where‚Äôs the handle? WHERE IS THE HANDLE??
He is so funny very talented .. Space Pants! 
This dude dads.  This has been my inescapable tantrum nullification hold for years.  As a bonus, it transitions well to the "I'm gonna eat you OM-NOM-NOM" game really well so you can get the giggles kick-started.
I've never wanted to see a face-swap more in my life...
The baby just got finished watching the movie "Pixels"
As cute as this is, I seem to remember PD hates being photographed so I just hope he knew this was being taken.
Baby dink
I only saw the top half of the picture and thought it was Ice-T
How adorable is this picture? His daughter is so freaking cute and she looks like shes having the time of her life with her daddy :-)
Ah yes, a similar ‚Äòturn into liquid‚Äô maneuver was also used by my baby today as she melted out of her high chair at a restaurant.  I approve of the two-handed between the legs football hold he employs.
Eitri and little (1500 years) old Thor.
Trial by combat 
I do not think that any actor has ever nailed a part that Peter Dinklage did in Game of Thrones.

He SMOKED IT. Pure and simple.
Judging by her face, this is obviously the correct way to carry a child. 
Peter Daughterage and his Dinkler.
He's an angry elf
She's 7 years old now!
I drink and I make things. 
Sweet little starfish!!
She is adorable 
He looks like he‚Äôs stealing a baby with the hat, the sunglasses, and the way he‚Äôs holding her. Lol
In 2 years she will be taller 
Kids are wriggly assholes. Sometimes this is the only carry position. 
I feel way more confident in my baby-holding skills now that I know that this is acceptable form
This is the proper way to hold a baby right?
Yup, been there (today).

I now have the arms of Hulk and the Belly of a Whale.
His wife works as a stage director and was doing an adaptation of Mac Beth I was working on; had just had this kid at the time. Peter and their daughter (older sister, about 5) showed up on a few days. Super chill dude and pretty much everyone, while pretty excited to have this large star in the building, was rather relaxed about him; gave him his space to hang out with his family, which he was there for.

First day he came by however we were in the middle of rehearsal and I see the side door crack open. I walk over to usher out the intruder of the space/give them the general ‚Äúsorry, were in the middle of rehearsal‚Äù spiel but I dont see a head so I kinda move myself halfway out the door assuming they backed into the hallway; almost kneed Peter Dinklage in the head (he‚Äôs not that short but was leaning over and I‚Äôm a tall dude). Mortified.

Edit: Reading some of the comments this may be the older kid that hung around and they had another baby since.
Celebrities, they‚Äôre just like us!
Just trying to hold on to ridiculously squirmy toddlers by whatever position necessary;)
I want to like this but it just feels like a huge invasion of privacy.
[Someone had to do it.](https://imgur.com/t9zLMPW)
Isn't this sub for cute pets? Am I mistaken? Should I be offended?
Me: "Hey Peter - cute kid"

PD: "that's what I do...I dink and I grow things"

Me: "well played sir... well played"
You should probably delete this before Queen Bavmorda finds out, and will be hot on his and the babies trail.
The guy looks like he's  really not looking for photos or recognition in this shot. Just trying to have fun with his kid and getting disturbed by paparazzi. Not feeling the "aww" factor here.
He looks like a mini Ice T. Like an Ice t
I saw him walking his dog a year or so ago on the west side near a small studio.  I was parked in a car and we made eye contact and I just stared at him through the vehicle glass and thought "that looks like Peter Dinklage, what the hell is he doing in NYC?" At the time it was very surreal as I had just come to NYC from St Louis the day before where there was a little person convention going on. I had never seen so many dwarfs in one place at one time and to see a very famous LP 24 hours after having left had to be an astronomical coincidence. I also wondered if he speaks at those types of events. I'm a big fan but I never spoke to him. 

I later googled him and found that he spends a lot of time in NYC and walks that dog a lot.  I saw an interview with him where he stated that he refused the roles like Ewoks and other cliched stuff because he wanted to be taken as a serious actor.   He is one of my favorite actors.    
Can relate ... have needed to carry my son like this **too many** times. 
I've loved his acting since "The Station Agent". 
I know this carry position! Was the best way to carry a toddler having a tantrum. 
It almost looks like he stole a child
I love that this makes him look like a giant assailing the villagers.
I will always downvote this. Leave the guy with his family alone.
That's an angry elf!

I meant his daughter.
Which one is Peter Dinklage? 
I wonder if she will be big (no dwarfism)?
Space Pants!
/r/photoshopbattle
Damn the kid is almost bigger then he is, somehow I thought Dinklage was taller.
In the end famous people are just people too
So cute
.....little light 
I found this to be the best way to hold my buddy's kid around the mall when he was being a terrible toddler. It's easy to control the kid, comfortable for them, and they can easily relax when they calm down.
Tyra Lannister
someone PLEASE photoshop Thor into this picture. 

I lack the means but the need is great!
r/photoshopbattles

I glanced at the thumbnail and was hoping to see the daughter holding him like a baby 

DreamsCrushed
I had a fantasy dream that featured him the other day. It was GoT meets LotR and it was crazy
I read somewhere that he is very strict of media taking photos of his kid .
Infact they didnt even reveal the gender or name 
First thing I thought was that this was some kind of hostage standoff with police involving a baby, then saw who it was carrying the baby and all good. Was going to say r/praisethecameraman as well lol
I drink and I carry things.
-Tyrion
I always picture him gigantic since Infinity War. This photo reenforces it.
üé∂ Dinklage little Dinklage little Dinklage little Dinklage little Dinklage little Dinklage little Dinklage little Dinklage little... Dinklaaaaaage Diiinklage little Dinklage little Dinklage üé∂
My heart warms up when I see this image
She will soon be carrying him that way
That baby came from the womb.
Which one is which? 
Tyrion and smol Lannister
Has he not researched this at all??   https://i.imgur.com/uRsZRQK.jpg
He sorta looks like Ice T. 
I see he knows the side ways grab well. Those buggers sure can squirm. 
Do a faceswap on the pic and you have an accurate glimpse into the future ca. 20 years
Wait until she's 20 and wants him to go somewhere he doesn't want to go.
I am an international student studying in Belfast. And I saw Peter Dinklage at the gym last year.
I was coming down from the stairs after a very intense gym sesh and I saw him putting a jacket on a girl about his height in front of the main entrance.

I was instantly starstruck,frozen and incredibly tired after my workout. I couldn't stop myself gawping at him and his daughter. Keep in mind I was wearing a hoody, with big glasses, so I probably had a hobo aesthetic going on. 

He took one look at me, glared back and walked out of the gym holding the girl's hand. I believe that was his daughter, maybe he took her for a swimming session or something?

Unsure to this day, but I believe that was a deserved reaction.


On mobile. Didn't read the title. Didn't see the entire image (only baby up). Thought this was Ice-T.
Pretty soon she will be able to do that to him!

!RemindMe10years
Ah, so I hold my daughter the same way Peter Dinklage does. Good to know.
Something about this makes me wonder if he just stole it from a random mother
D A D D Y D I N K L A G E
Can someone add this to the happy walking meme with Leonardo Dicaprio and Daniel Radcliffe? XD
That wizard came from the moon.
Its a wonderful picture of a truly happy little girl.  Which speaks volumes for Dad.  Love creates awesome humans <3

&#x200B;
Look how happy they both are this melts my heart
Awwww
I just got The Station Agent out of the library so I could watch it again. You should, too.
He seems like he would be a nice guy or fun in person. His character was a fucking absolute riot in Pixels. He nailed it. Infinity War? Baller.
The sippy cup is what gets me.
Ahh, the joys of wriggly angry toddlers :)
This is adorable

[deleted]
This giant talent is one of my favorite actors.  Whether being Liz Lemon's suitor or a wine imbibing Hand, he brings a lot to each role and makes you feel.
Did he adopt because I thought the kind of dwarfism he had was prevalent heriditarily? 
I only bring this up because we just went over his genetic disorder in my Genetics course at university like yesterday. 
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs fucking huge!‚Äù - Peter Dinklage, probably
Lmao cute
Give this man some privacy with his child. Reddit really needs some rules about posting pics like this, she‚Äôs way too young to consent to this and we shouldn‚Äôt be promoting these life sucking paparazzi.
She's 26
I‚Äôm pretty sure peter Dinklage is known as to not wanting his children known about by the general public as to protect them from fame. Not cool to post personal pictures of him if that‚Äôs true.
In a couple of years she'll be carrying him like this
His last name cracks me up everytime I see it
They should do the reverse of this pose in ten years.
In 10 years, the tables will have turned.
I don't know who Peter Dinklage is, but that is one HUGE toddler. Holy shit.
I was first daughter‚Äôs preschool teacher. Most down to Earth celebrity family ever, and daughter was a delight.
I have no idea who Peter dinklage is but that's the biggest fucking baby I've ever seen
I live in Australia and I don't know who this guy is. He seems nice, according to the first comment. Anyway, I love this photo. It's so natural, funny and sweet. The little baby girl is gorgeous and full of life. 
OH MY GOOOOOOD

I just fucking melted :-)
Looking like Ice Tea üòé
It looks like he is carrying her to make a sacritice to devil lol
i seriously thought that was Ice-T
The guy is one of my Hero‚Äôs!
That kid is just living this
That‚Äôs a big ass baby
Has he been papped? I thought he was deliberately very private
That's the face of regret.
"I think we're alone now"  Watch it.  Oscar worthy.
Little Dinkle!
Cute baby.
That's funny as hell. I'm glad he made it big. His skill is superb.
Serious question. Is dwarfism passed down?
I feel like this is a universal dad hold. 
Tuck your ear back into your hat before the elf jokes start!
r/photoshopbattles anyone?
That's awesome. My toddler always enjoyed being carried like that, still does.  We call it "sack of potatoes."
He's our true king... 
He‚Äôs in the middle of saying ‚ÄúStay fucking still!‚Äù
This is heartwarming. The best father daughter photo I've seen.
Is she a little person too? 
TIL
Mad man is about to body slam the shit out of her
idk if anyone can confirm this or not, but is Peter Dinklage the first actor with dwarfism to be cast in a role **not** written for an actor with dwarfism? (i.e. Bolivar Trask in X-men: Days of Future Past)

Does his daughter have dwarfism?
Will his daughter be short too?
They live a 10 minute walk from me.  The daughter and Peter almost ran me over on the sidewalk while on Peter's scooter a few weeks back.  Peter yelled out "Sorry!"

The next day, I saw Peter scootering responsibly in the bike lane (without his daughter).
Baby's gonna do what a baby's gonna do, doesn't matter how famous you are
Babies dress better than me
I just clicked off the Destiny subreddit and for a second though I was already back and was so confused.
I would love to see what r/photoshopbattles would come up with for this. 
Wow, very cute some daddy's won't do this to their kids

Who HASN‚ÄôT carried their howling small child like this at one point?
Peter Dinklage is Lenny Kravitz' son. 
I feel like he in the middle of saying ‚Äúfuck‚Äù because of a melt-down or something. 
Dinklage with the suplex! Good God almighty! 
This is as wholesome as hecc
This man, and all "little" people have my undying respect.

I bet he is a wonderful father. As a soon to be father, I respect him all the more... With each interview he gives perspective that most people will never experience.

He is an idol to Manny, and he has my admiration for ever.
I've liked him ever since "The Station Agent" film.
Kid needs some ChapStick.
That‚Äôs a great dad move
I fucking dare Piers twatmunch Morgan to criticize this......
Which one is he!?
r/blessedimages blessed parenting
Simply the cutest pic. 
Are children of vertically challenged people also vertically challenged or is there a chance they could be normal height?
He‚Äôs awesome. 
A dinklet! 
And her juice cup...that makes it unstaged and very real life for me
So much precious in one picture 
Seeing this picture made me wonder with genuine curiosity: Is it possible for little people (apologies if that is not the proper term) to have babies that are not little people themselves? What are the chances it gets passed on? Can the chances be reduced? I would assume it all possible but don't know much about that genetic condition.
His body slam needs work. 
"Karen isn't taking this fucking kid"
They should go as Bran and Hodor before she gets too big.
Would y‚Äôall be down to make a r/PeterBeingAwesome page? 
Is being a dwarf genetic or will his daughter be averse size?

But.... Peter Dinklage doesn't have a daughter. WHO'S BABY IS THAT? WHY PETE? WHY YOU STEAL THAT BABEH? 
A Guardian and his Little Light
They get big so fast
The original Little Light dadding. I like it. 
Why is he carrying her like a sack of potatoes 
So lucky...I would be star struck too
Lenny kravitz?
I can‚Äôt tell who looks more delighted. 
She'll be taller than him at age 10
Love Dinklage! Great actor and a great guy. It‚Äôs great watching everything he‚Äôs in and can‚Äôt help but smile when he‚Äôs on screen. Funny AND serious actor! Love him! GOT season 8 premier April 14 2019! Absolute hype!
this is one of the greatest pictures i've ever seen in my life LOL
kids are difficult. he even makes this look easy. ( imagines other parents have it soooo easy) 
i thought it was awesome that he was a giant dwarf in the comic book movie *ducks*

One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind 
In my mind she is saying "WEEEEEEE!!!"
If he does not call her Little Light I'm severely disappointed.
Wow, that‚Äôs a lot of upvotes
keeping a low profile
Been there
Wonder what pierce morgan has to say about this......(i scrolled for a while a didnt see anyone else bring it up but im to lazy to scroll through 1.3k comments so if someone beat me to it, forgive me)
I read he is Vegan to.
I remember Tattoo (Herve Villachese) was married to a really hot model.  Thought he could do better so he cheated/divorced his wife and quit his hit TV show, Fantasy Island.  Eventually he imploded because he couldn‚Äôt find any more women or any other show.  Just pissed it all away.
Nothing better than being a dad!!! 
I have the scene where peter dinklage gets mad in elf burn into my head so wouldn't say aww to his face haha
The next Targaryun Queen. 
Why does the baby look tall?
Here we see a viking hiking up a 10000¬∞ incline to feed his men with the giants daughter 
That‚Äôs a big baby
This has/r/photoshopbattles all over it

‚ÄúThis way, it‚Äôs a shortcut.‚Äù
What a cute little imp!
TIL Peter was his name.

He's going to feed sum dragons
I'm sorry - but isn't Peter one of the people who very much wants to keep their kids lives private?  
If I'm wrong - I apologize, but seriously - it's his kid and we should respect his request.

Not sure how much he'll appreciate seeing this posted on /aww
Anyone else think he looks like Lenny Kravitz in this pic?

Looks like Rob Pattinson in Good Time

is it true the public doesn't know his kid's names
ok, this really need to stop.  her daughter is probably eight by now
That kid is having an awesome time being carried around. And he seems pretty happy just being dad, too.

Dang. Daughter got so big she can carry him like that?
I've  heard this about him, that he's  down to earth and appreciates his fans.
Me too
Yes
So cool
Peter thought he could take on anything. He had taken dragons, kings and queens, and mutants, but he had no idea how hard a child was going to be...
He's a lot more healthy looking than a lot of the little people you tend to see.
r/photoshopbattles would have fun with this 
My father is 6'4" and carried me the same way. Just dad things.
I think that child is screaming.
What, is this the first picture of them in public? I thought he never allowed people to take their pictures never even told their nanes
Make & Model on those glasses?
Based on this photo alone, Peter is one lucky guy. 
she better be in GOT !!!
I saw the pic and my first thought was "Wow, I can't believe the baby came out of his small frame."

I think I need sleep. 
I thought I read somewhere that he was super secret high level protective of his family and never allowed photos or public appearances with them?
r/PsBattle
If you are a dwarf and have a baby. Will the baby be a dwarf also? If not, is there a bigger chance the baby will be a dwarf?
At least if he drops here she want have far to fall.
From the ignorance, being a father dwarf doesn't give very high chances his sons also are?

I mean I have some bad genetics (poor health, short, weak...) And just for fear of passing it onto my sons I rather adopt than have them via sex

Is this the way piers morgan expects bond to carry a child. 
What a cutie! Bet she is such fun to be with--daughters just have a way of üíù their daddies, and the dad's just can't refuse their little princesses anything that they want if it is not impossible or dangerous. Look out dads if your expecting a baby girl, the feeling of joy she brings you can happen very quickly. I think the whole attitude I  see between girls and their dads is worth an aww.
I hope his daughter (a lanester) will pay this Dept in kind
Think you mean by the rope around his neck
That‚Äôs a pretty normal way to carry a toddler when they are being a little shit
This reminds me of that video where the father picked up his kid like a grocery bag because the kid won't move.
Is she a dwarf too? Serious question
Wonder what he‚Äôs saying? Maybe ‚ÄúFly away, paparazzo‚Äù
Soon she'll be carrying him 
They grow so fast 
K I have to ask this question (don't mean to be disrespectful at all) but I know Peter is married to a 'tall' girl, will the child be 'shorter' or 'taller'? Does anyone know?

And sorry for the cringeworthy terms, I just don't know what the right way to say it is
They grow up so fast!

Dinklage, just wait 7 years. 
She's gonna outgrow him fast

Wonder if he‚Äôs gonna make her carry him like that when she‚Äôs old enough

He‚Äôs an angry elf

When he‚Äôs old that kid will carry him like that
His daughters almost bigger than he is

Why is his daughter carrying him?
Is his daughter also a midget?
In a few years they'll be shopping in the same clothing section
This picture 100 percent reinforces to my brain that I don‚Äôt at all want children. *shudder*

So tiny and cute!

She‚Äôs adorable, too!
I can't believe his daughter can pick him up at such a young age... 
**is she a little person too?**
Looks like my five year old trying to carry my 1 year old. 
Ah Patrice daughterlage
Just wanna see how everyone feels about the word midget
Absolutely nothing ‚Äúaww‚Äù about this 
I met Peter 5 days ago. I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a barbershop with my niece, and who walks in but fucking Dinklage himself. I was nervous as shit, and just kept looking at him as he was sitting there browsing the subreddit while waiting, but was too scared to say anything to him. Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Tyrion, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asked what's wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So Peter put his phone down, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barbershop. Chill guy, really nice about it. Would let him breast feed my niece again.
I'm no expert, but zI don't think that's how one usually holds babies.

So as a kidless type person, one of the things that always amazes me is everyone assumes I want a chance to hold their kid. *"Want to hold her?"* I usually respond with, *"No thanks, I don't want to break another one."* or, *"You don't want her? What kind of horrible person are you. Giving your kid away; for shame!"*
