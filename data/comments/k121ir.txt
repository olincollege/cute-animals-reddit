Meow that‚Äôs a glow up!
Crinkled Tissue XD oh shit
She looks like she stuck a paw in an outlet, put plugs in them things man.
Wow, I found one of your posts in the wild!!
**\[Congratulations!!! Your** ***Nimbus*** **is evolving!**\]

\[**Nimbus Has evolved into** ***Nimbus 3000!!!***\]
It was just a punk phase.  We all go through phases.
You have a very pretty kitty on your hands. What freaked her out in the first pic?
Her instagram is nimbus.kittycat if anyone wants to see more Crinkled Tissue!
Thats what my brothers kitten looks like right now. lol. There is hope
Top pic: That's what the Radiohead singer would look like if he was a cat.
Omg that first pic is LOL
Meanwhile, I'm heading firmly in the other direction.
Awesome name. Awesome kitty
What kind of cat is she?
Aww she looks a lot like my kitty Juliet! Is she a Turkish Angora?

Just a heads up, you might want to tighten her collar. As it stands, it's a hazard because she could accidentally get her jaw stuck under it while grooming herself. Collars on cats should only allow you to put 1-2 fingers between the collar and their neck.
Gorgeoouss
What a beautiful transformation!
oh my gosh she's so cute
I still have nimbus‚Äôs first pic saved on my phone from the first time you posted her! Glad to see that freaky lil creature grew into her look!
r/SupermodelCats
Amazing little ball of fury
she's so cute omggg
Nimbus possesses elegance and grace.
That is just too cute!
Awesome name!
Crinkled tissssssueeee omggg
My cat is also named Nimbus!
Gorgeous kitty, but I‚Äôm concerned about how dangerously loose the collar is in the second picture- please look into appropriate collar tightness, OP. I‚Äôd hate something to happen to your kitty.
The glow up
Looks like a diva
I have a pure white cat also named Nimbus!  They could be twins!
I have a gray boy cat named Nimbus! Great name :)
Great name, cute kitty
woooooowww
Downy featherboi to ultrasleek
Nimbus is a good name for this one.
The  kitten's face is the best thing I've see all day
She looks like one of two identical twin mean girls skiing the alps in an 80s movie.
Majestic!
The glow up tho
Meowgestic critter.
This looks like a Pok√©mon evolution line haha
That first picture will never be improved upon
Crinkled tissue is so accurate ahahaha adorable
Glad she's been drug free for a few years!
You know how you're not supposed to call babies ugly? I guess I should keep my mouth shut then... /s he has QUITE the look going on in the first pic!
From Nimbus to Nimbus 2000.
Oh my. That first pic is priceless. She look like angy lil ball of dryer lint. ü§£ And wow what a beautiful long girl!
I can just hear the FFFFFFTT, FFFFFFTT, FFFFFFTT tiny hisses.
**superMEOWdle
Somehow the name (Nimbus) fits through all stages 

That‚Äôs a great name for that cat
wow...
Awwww what a cutie patootie kittie butt.    Seriously that just melted my heart with cuteness that pic...
Did you add water or something?
That is a beautiful cat!
You're cat is so beautiful!‚ù§üß°
# Crinkled tissue
That‚Äôs a looong kitty.
You got me at "crinkled tissue," but Nimbus is such an awesome name!
I remember that top photo from awhile back. Honestly I think it may be in the top 10 cutest cat photos of all time. I‚Äôm glad Nimbus is doing great!
God she looks so precious
damn that's a pokemon level glow up right there
She's so cute.
Looks the kitten form has a bird‚Äôs face, that‚Äôs so fascinating
Oh my gosh she‚Äôs GORGEOUS!
Her grown-up eyes say "I own your soul now, too."
'crinkled tissue' made me laugh for way longer than I care to admit. She looks Glorious in both pics!
How did you get my before and after puberty photos..?
Lol

Pretty kitty
This is like a Pok√©mon evolution
Crinkled tissue got me
Hi Nimbus ‚ò∫Ô∏è
He a long boi
Nimbus!!! What a great name!!
Be careful who you call ugly in middle school
A beauty!
I was having a really shitty day until I saw this.
For real, thank you üíúüòª
She looks like the female love interest in a movie about a secret cat war
What type of cat is he/she?
She looks like an anime character in both the first and second picture lol
Terrified tissue?!

What a sweetie. I love the crinkled version.
That‚Äôs weird my cats name is nimbus too...
Such a pretty kitty!
I too look like ***CRINKLED TISSUE***
Still looks like Tilda Swinton. Love it!
Did... did you use face tune on your cat??
That looks like a really dangly collar.  Like it might get caught on something very easily.
Long haired kittens are either hilarious puffballs or complete messes.  But they always grow up to be gorgeous.
NIMBUS IS THE BEST NAME FOR A CAT
Thanks to COVID I look like that top pic right now. All the wind in my sails are gone. What a beautiful cat though.
Thanks guys
Pretty, but that collar is looking real loose.
An uncontrollable and very audible ‚Äúaw‚Äù forced its way out of my body when I saw this.
What kind of cat is this? It‚Äôs gorgeous
That cat Neville Longbottomed
Someone please adopt and groom me
Worth for "If you didn't want me then, you can't have me now".
I don't think thats how it work. It still food but... yea.. I will still eat it no matter it big or small
Still a very floofy cat. She gets anywhere with static, she's doing to go back to crinkly.
Nimbus is a certified beauty queen! What an absolute angel face!!! And omg she was the cutest little angry crinkled tissue I ever did see!!! I literally squealed aloud with delight at these pics. Thank you so much for sharing the very definition of a glow-up, featuring Nimbus! She's breathtakingly gorgeous, and she looks like she's got so much purr-sonality to go with her beauty! Love you, Nimbus!!! üêæüòªüíï

Long cat
The real glow up
Nimbus III?
Before and after getting clean from Meth addiction
OMG!!! How is this possible! I LOVE NIMBUS
r/flunk
This cat looks like Paris Hilton
Is that kitty from the planet of galactic peace?
The kitten has Florida Man energy.
I really like her name.
Yeah she did!
she‚Äôs **gorgeous**!.

Also, Nimbus is one of my favorite type of clouds.
Looks like a mystical creature that is going to give me advice for my anime journey.
That's seriously the most gorgeous cat I've ever seen.
She looks like duchess from aristocats !
Such a stately fluffs
What breed is she?
That is a really beautiful cat.
Is Nimbus a turkish van?
Before and after coffee
It happened. The headpats made him/her stronger... and more beautiful üòç
Before picture looks like Thom Yorke
My kitty's name is also Nimbus! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Majestic
What a beautiful kitty!
The nimbus 2002.
Kinda like my ex girlfriend!
This is the story of the that ugly duck who turn to be a swan all over the gain. ( idk the story name in English and I'm too lazy to search) good days
Her eyes omg.

Beautiful kitty!!!
Gokus nimbus transformed
Get this lady an insta STAT

Only those with a purr heart can pet this kitty
Nimbus 2000 to Nimbus 2001!
Damn that's a gorgeous cat.
I love Nimbus! Such a beauty! üòª
Purrfect floofer!!  üòÑüòç
You glow girl
Both are beautiful
This is truly the January Jones of cats
Kitty: "Don't get me we..."

Aaaaand it's back to tissue time. ;)
*Evolves with high friendship*
more like a used swiffer duster than a tissue
Great name.
"I said FUJI, you absolute cretin!  This is clearly DASANI.  Do I look like a plebeian?  And these mice are certainly NOT grain fed.  Remove yourself and send a new human."

-That cat
That lucky kid that skips awkward puberty
Why does the first image look like those worms on a string lol
That glow up tho
Beautiful cat. But I'm in love with the crinkly kitty.
Is this how Pok√©mon evolution works?
Kitten Nimbus reminds of Jeff Goldblum's final form in The Fly
Young Nimbus looks like shiny jolteon.
[made this when i first saw the little kitty ](http://imgur.com/a/0Sa8Z7s)
I named my first cat Nimbus! Black and white male. He was my little mama's boy üòª Mine was named after Flying Nimbus from DragonBall üòÅ
Now that there is a nice kitty.
Omg I had a dog named Nimbus!!!
All I see is Thom York in that first pic
Still wondering why there is a cat inside...
Paris Hilton face
Wow, that is one pretty kitty!
Lol a time lapse would be awesome!
Baby Nimbus looks like wet toilet paper when you throw it against a wall :))
"btich, I'm fabulous!"
The duality is unmatched
Nice looking fox
Why is your cats collar a v-neck
That's the true model experience. We think of models as glamorous but in their childhoods and off time a lot of them are just little creachers.
Be careful who you call ugly in middleschool
That wheelbase tho
I really liked the crinkled tissue tbh
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Wowie, mighty pretty kitty you've got there
[i'm sorry but in the first one she looks like the shriveled up wojak](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EiFV6bJVkAExjvJ.png)
The one on top looks like my grandmother just after waking up.
What kind of cat?
Ummm, how does that cat actually look like a supermodel, especially in her face?!?
She‚Äôs still your little crinkled tissue on the inside
Good news everyone!
Why does her face almost look photoshopped?
I saw that side view, ears perked, stare in the kitty pic before. That's the "you wanna catch these hands" look
Is it just me or does this cat look kinda... long?
Great name! Like a beautiful cloud, perfect!
[starrthepowerr ](https://onlyfans.com/starrthepowerr)
Crinkled Tissue...  ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
One of the best pictures I‚Äôve seen !!
Aptly named. Sleek.
Gorgeous
From a Jolteon to a Persian. They've got beautiful markings.
Nimbus is such a great name.
more like Firebolt
I‚Äôm hoping Nimbus is a reference to clouds, because that‚Äôs a super clever pet name.
You‚Äôve forgotten your ways kakarot!
Now that's a glow up
That first picture looks like Thom Yorke.
Blessed Bastet's Whiskers, that is a beautiful animal.
Looks like nine tails.
Alot of white, lol
Didn't you post this a few months ago?
Wowwww gorgeous!!!
Weirdly reminds me of uma Thurman
LITERALLY
The cat looks like the girl from Bad Teacher - Amy Squirrel
What a beautiful kitty! I also had a dear cat named Nimbus, he passed away in March of this year and things haven't been quite the same. Cherish every moment with your sweet, sweet Nimby, sending love. :)
Be careful who you make fun of as a kitten üò§
I read this as Dingus at first
Nimbus got soo long!
omg I have a picture of that smol guy on my phone from a long time ago
nimbus is more majestic than it's name. wow.
S√ül
I like the first one better
Crinkled Tissue is the best name for him!! Definitely the new band name.
Glowup!
Damn ok nimbus I see you
What a beautiful cat!
That's how mafia works!
She's like a white Bill The Cat in that 1st pic!

Akkkk!
Does Nimbus only have one front leg?
Supurrrmodel
The top picture is way too cute.

I don't get tired of looking at it.
Looks like a Pok√©mon evolution
That's like Jaleel White level transformation.
Amazing what a few months of care will do.
Oh my goodness I remember her! What a precious kitty!
I like how she's fluffing herself out to make herself feel braver, but in the second picture she KNOWS she's Queen
Nimbus is gorgeous üòª
My dog is named Nimbus, too!
But I also enjoy the Crinkled Tissue
Weird cat benevolence in that expression in the bottom picture.
It's great.
That‚Äôs a cute crinkled tissue though!
Aw
Majestic Floof!!
looking super
What a great name for a kitty!
I would tighten that collar up. If it gets out he/she might get hung up on something and potentially hang itself.
Can't imagine the amount of daily maintenance a white long fur kitty needs! You did a great job!
I honestly really loved the crinkled tissue level!
Now that's a cat right there.
Her eyes look like an anime character lol love it
[insert deep statement about society]
Wow! What a beautiful kitty! Utterly gorgeous, and a perfect name.
Me not showering for one week vs me after 1 breath mint

This is like a Pokemon evolution
That kitten saw some shit in a past life.
Wait is this the thom yorke of cats?
Kitty was an electrocutie pie
Tilda Swinton as a cat
Oh spooky tissue

Gorgeous!
Did you just repost your own picture to the same sub 6 months later?
this looks like a pokemon evolution.
She was so funny looking hahah I love it.
Fresh tissue vs tissue in your pocket after washing and drying.
Be careful who you are calling cute/adorable in high school, they be majestic!
She has such kind eyes <3
Wow, what a beautiful cat!
So silky..
OH MY GOD ITS AN ANGEL
Ivanka? Is that you?
This isn't a glow up, its a straight up pokemon evolution

Perfect name of a perfect cat
Great name!  Just perfect
I never thought you could use ‚Äúcrinkled tissue‚Äù as an adjective
Just look at that magnificent tail!
Why do the legs in the background of the kitten picture make me so uncomfortable?
Dude he is like omg look at this beauty
Baby Nimbus almost looks like a Jolteon
Be careful who you call ugly in middle school
That‚Äôs how mafia works
Careful who you call ugly in the pound
OMG what a princess üòç
Hey its the cat from [https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/Persian-Cat-Room-Guardian](those creepy memes)!

Edit: literally, fuck this markdown parser
Is it okay to have his collar that loose? Do you think it's more comfortable? Asking because I wish I could let my little guy hang out at home without one, but if he's going to wear one I always want it to be as comfortable as possible.
Still fuckable!
Looks like a Pok√©mon evolution
That's clearly a Persian.
Sheesh, are you sure this isn‚Äôt just some intelligent alien species which the only thing are feeble brains can approximate it to is a cat? 

Seriously gorgeous though.
Went from Nimbus 2000 to Nimbus 2001!
Damn she looks like an animagus. Professor Mcgonagall's got nothing on her.
That is a beautiful cat.
Wow! Question: is Nimbus deaf?
He pulled a Longbottom
The kitten picture looks like that cat that got pulled out of a house fire and said ‚ÄúTWAS I THAT SET THE HOUSE ABLAZE!‚Äù
Found our actress for Disney's inevitable live action *Aristocats* movie.
AHHHH SHE‚ÄôS BEAUTIFUL

Before and after catnip addiction

Upgrades, people, upgrades
Hey! They were always a supermodel! Just look those pristine eyes and perfect ears! If that‚Äôd be a crinkled tissue for you, it‚Äôd be gold to me. ;)
Meowth and Persian

Crinkled tissue is a fantastic way to describe him

Growlith to arcanine

Nimbus is the perfect name for this ki-ki.

She went from " MAM! Where's your fking son?!" To " hello mam, may i have the company of your son please."
Ps: so cuttttttteeeeee!
Lololol like a little burnt cotton ball was dipped in sacred oils and refreshened
I like how you called your kitten a crinkled tissue. Thats so funny to me and never heard anyone describe or called any being as such. üòÑ
That‚Äôs a glow up for sure
Like the cinderella dragon from ‚ÄúBurn the Witch‚Äù (Anime)
That‚Äôs a Pok√©mon
It‚Äôs all about the right floof products.
Hunnyyyy.she was cute as a kitten and beautiful as an adult!
Beautiful floofy kitty

I think more from crackhead fox to good looking cat

Angry thunder cloud> happy poof cloud

You just posted this 6 months ago -- https://old.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/gryjbl/nimbus_looks_a_bit_different_a_year_later/ .  I guess there's no rule about re-posting your own stuff.
Kitten is way to young to be without the mother. Hopefully the mother is also in the house.
Yeeeeees! Amazing! The First Photo is on a Spotify playlist of mine! Love it
Did she tho?
