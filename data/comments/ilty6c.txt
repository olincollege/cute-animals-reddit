I love the part where the dogs are on a walk and the puppy was holding the leash of the bigger doggo in its mouth
Companionship right here.
So this is part 1

Where is part 2-25?
This is my wholesome dose for today. Thank you
/r/dogs_getting_dogs
I have a pretty brutal headache today. this helped! Thanks!
This may be the first video I’ve seen where a good amount of time is elapsed (pupper grows up a little bit) where at the start someone is wearing a mask. Times really are changing I guess.
Can you imagine how it must feel for an older dog to get a puppy to play with? Makes them feel young again too
Are the names reference to Jasper Park and Lake Louise?

Very cute dogs in a great video.
We tried this with our dog.  He's 6.  He's a gentle giant who loves everything with a heartbeat.  Loves people.  Loves other dogs.  Loves cats.  Just more friends in his opinion.

So we rescued a 3 month old puppy.  Our dog wanted absolutely nothing to do with it.  Was aggressive to the pup.  Wasn't eating for days.  Spent a lot of his time hiding in the house.  We wanted this puppy to be a friend for him and the best we could hope for was an uneasy truce someday.  Wasn't fair to our dog so the puppy went back to the rescue. (Don't worry.  Puppy was cute AF and got adopted again immediately.)  We had never seen that side of our dog before.  I guess you can't like everyone.

So we spent a lot of time looking for an older rescue, introducing them first, making sure they were ok with each other.  And we found his BFF.  Total partners in crime.

I was half expecting it to end with the puppy, alone, and grown up.
MY HEART
Smol dog stays smol
That is some heartwarming shit right there
Young dogs learn so much from their older companions.
I'm not crying, you are
I was already pretty stoked on the pups but realizing this is in Toronto got me hyped, hope I run into them 🥺👉🏽👈🏽🥺
I absolutely love this
Why do I have to be allergic to dogs. I want a gr so bad
Lost my puppy 2 days ago 😭😭😭 crying
Gives you a perspective of how long COVID's been too since the owner was already wearing a mask when the puppy was introduced.
I was like oh they're wearing masks at the beginning of the video so there isn't enough time for the puppy to get much bigger.

Then I remembered how long this year has been.
It must be nice to make enough money to actually have a life and be able to afford pets instead of living in abject wage slavery
That was beautiful
This is so sweet it made me cry a little ❤️❤️❤️
This is unbearable cute.
What a dream life to have two pups like that!
I just hear the song “When you’re the best of friends .. “ from The Fox and The Hound when I see videos like this.. so damn cute!

Wait. What happens next? When part 2 is coming out. I need closure
I got my free award yesterday, gave it to this post but if i could award a whole sub, i would award r/aww definitely. This sub helped me get through difficult times, brought me happiness when i was down among numerous other things! One day i hope to own a pet and treat him nothing less than my best buddy and age together to have a companion cos i'm sure everyone else would leave me but my pet will always be by my side!
*Up song plays*
Very wholesome
big sweetie and lil sweetie 🤗
What a wonderful video!  Thank you so.much for posting!!!
How can I upvote this multiple times?
This brought warm tears to my eyes.  Thank you for that.  Dogs needs buddies, omgosh, Jasper and Louise.  I love them!  So happy.  You are a great person.  This is going to be the last thing I look at on Reddit for the day.  This really is sending me off to work with a happy attitude.  Thanks again, you da man. :)
All I can hear while watching this is “you’ve got a friend in me” from Toy Story lol
ABSOLUTELY precious
Blink and you'll miss it.
So precious!
Was anyone else expecting it to end with the older doggo’s funeral? I was ready for the waterworks to start at that point.
This is so heartwarming, I wish the rob and big intro song was playing over it
My head just automatically played you got a friend in me.mp3
This makes me want a golden retriever
People let me tell you about my beeeesst frrriiieeeennd 🎶🎶
Fluffer pupper
We have one of those living with us, sweet and extremely smart. He is a service dog for our son in law who lost his right leg while he was riding a tank that hit a hidden mine in Afghanistan.
My heart.
I was expecting the old dog to die and i don't think i could have handled it ... glad he/she didnt
Puppyhood
I don’t know why I expected to see a funeral
I’m convinced 85% of golden retrievers Live better lives and eat better food than lots of Americans and the rest the world
When you're the best of friends...  [🎵](https://emojipedia.org/musical-note/)
This is the one breed of dog I can’t tell if they’re cuter as puppies or fully grown. I need one in my life
What Disney movie is this
I love this so much
i was so worried this was going to end with the younger one saying goodbye to the older one.
When they are holding onto the same stick 😭😭😭
I will require quarterly updates. Please and thank you ☺️
Have this Reddit gold for that golden puppy! 



...



That's what I would've said if I had one. Here, take this upvore filled with love instead.
Goldens are the absolute best
This honestly makes me sad. This video reminds me of my dog. She’s 9 year old golden retriever and idk how long she has left, but I’m trying to make the best of the time left.
I needed this, thank you.
Everytime I see a video of a golden, I must admit that I am jealous. They look like the most kind hearted biggest teddy bears and I want one!
What a beautiful thing to witness ! Love this
Surprised none of them are called Luna
I love dogs
Watching this brought a smile to my face...I miss my Golden retriever Max, he was a good boy
My heart, it is bursting with love.
This is beautiful. 

I’ve looked at this for 5 hours now.
God I need a 2nd dog.
Have award
Why does this make me sad and want to cry?
This is like a start of a really sad Disney movie!
This post has almost 500 AWARDS, 
and deservedly so
I spent the entire video waiting to cry at the older dog dying part... thankfully that never came!!
To think that the elder Golden had no older member to teach him the ways....
Watching this while my kids are watching Toy Story 4, and the song “You’ve got a friend in me” is perfect with this!
Wish I could give more than one "like"...
Beautiful friendship right there!
I love this =D
True awww material

So sweet <3 This has made my day
Goldens have some of the best eyebrow expressions
Thank you so much for sharing that with us.  I needed it
I love this so much I can't stand it.
Thanks for starting my day off right!
I'm curious as to how older dogs look at younger ones. Do they see them more as a little brother/sister or more of a son/daughter?
Where is the rest?!
Can’t wait for Season 2.
That’s beautiful.

Golden retrievers are so gentle!  Our standard Schnauzer would love a puppy playmate, but he would be all over them and certainly not sharing toys at all.
I'd love to get my dog a puppy but she hates puppies also she gets jealous if we give other dogs/babies attention
I gasped out loud at the cuteness when they lowered the little puppy in.

HOW CAN THIS BE SO CUTE? I need answers!
Two buds. :)
Omg I hope they fall in love 🥰
damn we've been in "quarantine" so long that the pupper became a full-on doggo 😢
I like the part where the tables turn and your not sure who gets the stick.
Someone should combine this with the one of the golden retriever sitting on the other one's head over and over.
I swear, every dog needs a dog.
Thanks. I needed that
I needed that
 I need more of this in my life.
Yeah, this made my day a lot better. Thank you for sharing!
Goldens seem like the sweetest dogs but I feel like they need a bath everyday with so much long hair.
It started to make me tear, if only because I wanted it to keep going where the older sibling grows old and dies in front of the younger sibling, completing the cycle. I think that would have been an even cuter bittersweet video.
I can hear the song in background  "When I'm Sixty Four"
But one day that younger pupper won't be able to find their friend :C
This video is the prime example that r/aww is the best subreddit (imo)
What a good big brother! No matter how smart the dog is, is always so much easier to train a puppy with a well behaved older dog. She’s going to be absolutely awesome.
“Doghood” 

Make the movie now.
Tik tok has got me fucked up because I’m sitting here watching the video without any audio and here I am singing 🎶when somebody loved me, every thing was beautiful...🎵
Disney title screen

Pixar title screen

This video, animated

Next scene: young pup in the big dog bed, sad and alone with two tennis balls. One rolls out the door, pupper chases it.

Movie title screen: LOST 

Adventure ensues. Animal friends are made. Maybe a brain damaged chicken or a recklessly brave turtle. Emotional healing happens. Ball is retrieved, but he gives it to a sassy street cat he met, she needs it more. The real ball was the love inside him. He finds his way home. Happy. Brave now like the turtle. Clucks like the chicken. Sassy like the cat. Misses his friends. Sad. Ball rolls up and boops his nose. His friends followed him home!

End credits.
I am love
This is adorable... i had a older golden retriever that grew up with a pup yorkie... the retriever loved her and always ran around with the yorkie..
what?? I would give my left nut for my dog to get along with my puppy this well. even just a fraction...
Oooh nooo so cuuute
My little old guy has a tumor. I want to get him a little buddy but don’t know if that will help him companionship wise or annoy him.
I believe when good dogs die they get to come back as golden retrievers.
So much kinder to each other than cats.

Signed, 
A Cat Lover
Cute
For those who don't know the breed, small dog got that big probably within a year, and big dog could still be a puppy between 1-2 yrs
This is what I needed to see after a long day’s work. Thank you.
Omg! The snuggles, the leash holding... I’m crying. So sweet!
Jasper and Louise - are you from the Rockies or something 😂

Little did the older know  .... HE was training hs replacement

Golden s are the BEST dogs ever!!!
It's nice to see that the older dog is also initiating some playtime. Far too often I see these scenarios where the younger dog is super excited and the older one is obviously over it. Can tell that this love goes both ways.
I think it’s so important for dogs to live with other dogs. We used to have just the one. Then we got a second dog and the happiness levels increased all round.
u/vredditshare
i wish my puppo would even walk next to me 😭
You guys are making me want another puppy, especially since we had a friend bring over his puppy and my dog who was really rowdy growing up was so gentle with him. I was so proud of my little girl, even though she really loves barking at babies and old people walking in our neighborhood
This is what I wanted for my dog - to have a little pal. But they hate each other! Ugh...this is so adorable though.
!remindme 16h
... Don't we all grow up with someone?
“Let me tell ya bout my best friend”
Can we just make this into a movie already?
Can someone add the sad music from Up and mess with my heart?
Doesn't the big dog realize the small dog is a hot-swappable spare?
It makes me sad thinking that the older dog only has the younger one as a pup for a brief time before it becomes an adult. Then they become collie-gues. 

(Yes I know, not the right breed).
AwwwwDorable
I miss my dog so fucking much.  We grew up together.  I love you, Oadie.  Forever.
THELMA!!
Always good to see friends.

Are the dogs still alive
Aww so cute❤️🐶
Absolutely adorable 🐾🎈
And eventually... the older dog dies, leaving the younger one only with the memories.
This made me cry.....So I own dogs myself...currently I own 3 Basset Hounds...originally we owned two males named Gunner and Sarg.....well when we got our third one named Luna....Gunner stepped in and cuddled her while Sarg played with her......then Sarg passed away...  so we got Lily....the Luna cuddled and played with Lily (Gunner was too old)....then we got Lola after Gunner passed away.....and the two girls did the same to Lola as they had done to eachother growing up....

This made me wish I got more pictures of the boys with Luna than what I did...

Sweetest thing ever 🐶🐶😍😍😍
Can someone explain why some dogs have the cones on their head? What's the purpose of it, seems uncomfortable idk.
Queue “You’ve got a friend in me”
Thank you for sharing cheered up my day
Hai doggy
You mean growing pup with someone💖
I wanted to see them be big doggies together :(
I spy a Toronto parking meter.
Best quarantine ever
The most perfect video in the world 😍😍😍😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I really needed to see this. Love this.
What type of dog is this?
This is my biggest dream 😭❤️
Pupper at the start of video: :/

Pupper at the end: !!! OMG!!! A PUPPY!!! :D
Oh thank God it ended...

I thought we'd get so far we'd see the older dog get real old and I didn't have it in me today to see that.
My brovaries, man. 😍
That's one floofy pupper
How old are the dogs?
Awwww 🥰
Awww this too beautiful!!
Thanks I’m crying
Such beautiful dogs
Always....never know when they may escape on accident
Okay, you're REALLY trying right now. But I WILL RESIST !!!
I spent the last 30 seconds preparing to cry at the end.
Pupper and doggo on a field trip
I was lowkey waiting for the end where the older dog dies and the young one is laying on his gravesite
I just absolutely **adore** little dog waking bug dog
Thank u so much for this. Makes me smile at the end of an exhausting day. Thanks!!!
I'm not crying, you're crying
If this was a live action Disney movie, in the first couple seconds the adult dog would be dead
In the name of god I grant these doggos immortality
Such a heartwarming video. Thank you!!
When you're the best of friends, having so much fun together...
Lmao my little dog just humps our older dog
They got the puppy just to make this video.
Wish more than anything that my shepherd would bond with another dog like this. So adorable and they will both be so much better off with each other!
Toronto, Old Distillery area
Does anyone know the age of the big dog?
Soon as I saw the mask I thought "this puppy won't get TOO much bigger in this video" and I was right! This means there will be a director's extended cut in the next few months and I am HYPED for it.
Absolutely adorable!

How can people not love dogs!?!?
I'm always amazed when people have dogs that don't take off for the hills. 

My dad gets a dog, gives it 0 traininf and yet it just walks wherever he walks. 

I train my to go to their creates on command, sit, basic word commands, all that. But if they get the opportunity they will book it and run away if I try to get them.
Why does such a young pup have a cone on?
This made me smile, thank you.
I love my golden retriever. They are so amazing.
This is just precious... warms my heart. I wish our country could come together like this
I don't like Carrots but if they do I am willing to convert.
that looks like a really early spay/neuter.
I'm crying
Those doggies are 100% happiness and joy
Our golden was identical to this with our great Pyrenees puppy. Unfortunately, the great pyr out grew our golden in 5 months.
OMG I CANT THIS IS SO CUTE ❤❤❤
How does one view this gif? Just showing up as a still of a puppy being carried under an arm on my phone.

Edit: NVM, had to "request desktop site" to get it to load. Why is reddit running so poorly lately? I just want the look at puppies!

So. Many. Awards. Oh my god.
Best way to keep an old dog young is to get em’ a pup to take care of.
I awwwwwed the whole time, you hit the mark.
When the humans bring you a little sister to take care of
I found this extremely stressful to watch. I was so worried it was going to end with a gut punch of the older dog being dead.
This is beyond adorable.
“Come on let me tell ya bout my beeessst friend!”🎶🎶
Such cuties. I love them both!!!
What’s the age difference?
That gif was golden!
🥇 take this im broke
I'm either getting no dogs or two dogs
Now I know that if I ever give in to my kids desire for a dog. I'll need to get two.
Wonderful footage 🐕❤
This was like my Golden Retriever (older) and Golden Lab (younger). Except the retriever would always try to get the Lab lost in the woods. Now he's too old to do any running and the younger one is always by his side. I don't know how he'll take it when the Retriever passes away. Hell I'm not sure how I'm going to take it.
Awww my heart 😍❤
And then there’s us...
My stick..nooo my stick
“Oooooo you’re makin me live”
the big one is so gentle and sweet!!!

I DID NOT COME ON HERE TO CRY TODAY 😭
Owie ouch my heart
Anyone else hear Randy Newman in their heads while watching this?
I live near a town called Jasper.  There seems to be a surge in dogs named Jasper.  Great name.
So, so very nice😍
My heart!
Blessed content.
I would love to see the full length version.
Thank you for sharing.
I was kinda getting nervous because I wasn't sure how much time was going to pass.
Fine, I’ll get a buddy for the doggo.
This is so wholesome I prepared for Disney/Pixar to show me the young one dressed up at a funeral for the older one.
It's a movie, man...a movie of life.
I want I want I want awwwwwww puppos AAAAHHHHHH
My goodness this is cute. 
I have 2 pugs. When we brought the younger one home, the older one was stoked until we went to bed and he realized that he was staying. My older dog shit on my carpet every day that week, he was so mad.
Awesome such happy times

My golden turned 2 today and this makes me want to get another. I told myself at the beginning that one was enough and raising a puppy is hard... But man is it worth it.
Those are some great park names. Cheers for the smiles.
She got so big by the end
Ok but will they reform the ussr or is that still up to me
Damn my dog growing up with a 1 year old was definitely not this pleasant.

I just think it’s really cute......😍
This whole video took place over like 3 months I bet.
I was expecting this to become sad where the older one becomes old and decrepit, and the young one is now the leader so to speak
So cute! 😍🥰
if you added some lion king’s music to this, would be marvelous
Exactly how my German Shep was with my 6 yr old Aussie.
I have a olde English bulldog puppy and a rough collie and they act like they are brothers it is so cute
Jasper and Louise?  Omg. Dead. 😍🥰😍
Why I want another dog
Lol, I'm currently living the less photogenic version of this life (2 goldens, a 2 yr old and a 4 month old).  It's awesome and joyful but kinda chaotic, and unlike these two, my two dudes can't stay clean for 5 seconds.  And there is So Much Dog Hair Everywhere.  So.  Much.  Dog Hair. Wouldn't trade it for anything though.  :)
Cuteness overload!
🥰🥰🥰
Two friends who will not be parted...so sweet.
It's enough to make a grown man cry
If I die one minute from now, it will have been a good last minute on earth.
What a sweet journey! 😍🥰😘

"Oh boy you bought me a wife! Might have to wait a few months though..."
Cue the waterworks when the older dog dies in a few years and the other one, who never knew the world without his buddy, sinks into a depression. Good job, dimwit, don't take pets with such a huge age gap between them.
and then they had sex
