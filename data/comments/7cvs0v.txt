That dog looks game for anything. Like one of those friends whos down for a road trip anytime, anywhere. Just say the word.
That second pic of the dog... omg... so much love there

I wouldn't mind getting these selfies all the time
I bet the dad has a strong affinity for duct tape.
How old do I have to be before I start wearing that hat? I feel like if I wear it now it looks like I'm just a hipster. I want to protect my neck!

EDIT: For reference, I'm 31, but not a dad. Also, I kind of AM a hipster, proudly, but I think the hat is a little much. I have one that I use for hiking, I'll keep it to that use.
Finally, a break from all the EA posts. Way to go, pops. 
I bet that guy has a nice little piece of land with a lake, where he fishes a few times a week.  He looks forward to the smell of burning hickory logs in the wintertime, while he practices a few songs he knows on his guitar as the snow silently falls outside the window.  He has missed his wife the last 4 years but knows she's in a better place.  Sometimes he says her name out loud in those windless quiet moments around dusk as Millie runs away after the geese on the shore.
My sister and I did the same thing with my parents. Over half the pics I get from them now are them in random places with their dog. No regrets
So much cute happiness on Reddit this morning! I'm working hard to get myself to this type of life 😃
This is the cutest fucking thing.
His daughter looks like such a goodboi
Good dog.

Good dad.
They def need a Instagram account, so much love.
I would like your dad to be my dad. 
This is just too much for the aww part of my brain to handle!!
If the dog doesn’t find you handsome she should at least find you handy - Red Green
Wiggle butts love fiercely and without reservation.  Those are some pretty awesome pictures of that.

What it doesn't capture is the dog's sincere questioning of why the man is playing with the little toy and not the dog.

"I am right here, human that I love.  Put that toy down and let's play."  They're like Hobbes, in dog form.
He looks like a kind wizard 
THIS IS WHAT IM HERE FOR
Rock on Dad. Rock on Doggo
They look so cute together holy...
Looks like Red from the RedGreen show.
Dude looks like a slightly past middle aged Gandalf.
Need a new subreddit just for this: /r/BeardsAndBorderCollies

Overfilled with love ♡
Yeeeesssssss.  

I hope he was a good bloke to her.  His face sure is nice.  The man's, too.  
I don't think that's his daughter
Doggies love... those amazing eyes on the second selfie! 

G o o d b o i s <33
wow is this from a fairytale? looks magical. i want to live in it
The dog seems to be a natural at this already. 

Also, the affection you see in the pups eyes in the second picture is just awesome. 
r/wholesomeasfuck
This right here! Something good and pure in this world. Doggo obviously loves it’s bearded human
Correction: Daughter teaches dad and doggo how to take selfies.
This is what happiness looks like.
He could sell his pics to be used as those sample photos for picture frames.
They are both fricken adorable
Student has become master.
You can tell this is a hella cool dad.
Good doggo 
Frame worthy pictures! 
Awesome photos
D'aww look how genuine the smile of the dog is. Wonder how much care was given for the good boy to love the owners this much
That’s so perfect. They were made to be together 😊
The title is pure internet cancer 
"ah ruh roo"
SO cute! Awwwwuh, I love dogs and happy dads
That pup loves photots.
Thank you for this. 
That admiration from man's best friend though?!!
Looks like the dog already knew how to selfie. 
I didn't know Johnny Appleseed is still alive, and that he has a daughter and a dog.
That looks just like my dog
This is beautiful. 
Wish my dog would take a selfie with me. Lovely pics btw 
And the student has become the master.

Captain Bullock with GCPD's newest mascot
But how did the dog know how to take selfies?
Santa? Is that you?
Pup pup and pop pop.
The dad looks like he is the one who should teach others how to take selfies.
My dad's selfies aren't nearly as majestic.
I like the picture but holy shit that title. 

What happens? He takes a selfie? No shit Sherlock, that’s what she taught him... 
Omg. /r/ladyboner material right there!


/r/matureladyboner 
That's gotta be an Aussie. Mine stares at me the exact same way!
Is this your dad?
Aw!!
*Aww, I can't deal*
Those cops needed you Harvey. Instead you go out making selfies with a dog.
Find someone that looks at you the way this doggo looks at his hooman. 
/r/dogsmirin
Damn already a pro 
Tom Bombadil?
This is so beautiful. I want him to be my Dad too. 
This is pretty much the greatest thing ever.
The student becomes the master.
He's a lumberjack and he's ok......
That looks like my anxiety dog I just wish it loved me that much :,) 
Good boy is having a selfie with his human outside his forever home.

Tom Bombadil? 
Name a better couple!
The dude legit looks like wizard in the second pic. 
I wonder if she's aware her Dad is going to break the internet now.
We don't deserve dogs. 
my fucking heart, it was not ready
I love everything about this <3 <3 <3
Look are the love in that dog's eyes.  
I'm gunna go out on a limb and say these two are super duper close. 
If only I could find a human to love me the way that dog loves him. 
These would make great greetings cards.
This is so cute! 
I like the first pic of the dog licking the jacket he loves the smell of :-)
FRAME DAT SHIT
This made my day.
The daughter has done us all proud
Best possible outcome, really.
The dog and all that jazz is cute but this mans skin is incredible and I️ am mesmerized. 

EDIT:
Apple has got me screwed sorry for the question mark. 
Stop! Too adorable!
I wish I had a dad like that. 
wholesome af
Ahh I wish my dog didn't run away from me everytime I get my camera out 
Step 1: Be adorable
That dog looks like one of my dogs. 
This is the best thing.
The show of mutual love is so heart warming.  Thank you
Filter wiped out all them wrinkle, just made him a blurry mess lol.  Beautiful picture and love, that’s a good dog right there.
And Dad teaches the dog about selfies. 
That first pic of the dog... omg... so much derp there
r/mirin
He looks so derpy! The dog is cute too.
That's what happened to my Dad, except in his new found selfie wisdom it was always pictures of his face super close up.
That puppers looks like my badger-marker Pyrenees! 
I’m having a rough day and needed this kind of picture
I don't have a dog and I'm crying. 
its like a love pic and a goofy pic! AMAZING
the best selfies
The happiness.....it’s overflowing.
Border collies are so full of love.. My old boy is napping next to me as I type.
Is that Thoros of Myr ?
Taught *how* to take selfies..?
I never knew Radagast had offspring. 
Everything about this is AWESOME!! I don't know who's happier, the dad or the dog!!!
Everyone knows how to take s picture of themselves. People have been doing it for decades.
#lifegoals
This is literally the best thing I’ve seen all week. 
Those pic are incredibly heartwarming. The dog love, the father smile. This is how happiness look like, fishing with your dog, taking selfies together. 
A wizard is never late nor is he early he takes selfie precisely when he means to
*looks accusingly at my dog*  Why won't YOU take pictures like that with me?  (He hates the paparazzi)
If the women don't find ya handsome, they should and least find you handy. 
This is precious! 
Look at that starlight in the dogs eyes... they're happier than most couples lol
Cutest pair I've seen today! So much love in that puppers face!
Your dad is exactly what my childhood image of Santa  looked like.

Such wonderful selfies.


Man that guy is rich on life. Got everything he need, amazing beard and a loving doggo.
Tinder game 10/10
Fuck you this is so good

Beautiful, thank you for this content

Nice beauty filter on first one
You Won't Believe What Happens Next!
I blame you
Harvey dent from Gotham... Is that you?
looks like Harvey Bullock from Gotham
For a second i thought your father was [Rich Lewis from Mountain Men](http://www.history.com/shows/mountain-men/cast/rich-lewis)
Still can’t convince him to change his shirt every once in a while aye?
I mean who doesn't know how to take selfies tho?
Is this the man from mountain men? 
Is that the guy from Mountain Men!?
I thought it was that dude from the Red Green Show.
That looks like StreetBike Tommy 
He looks like Harvey from Gotham
Someone tell me that’s not Harvey Bullock from Gotham 😂
Reminds me of this guy:

That's is so sweet. Much love, much wow.
Wombat from the block
Is the daughter the dog? Maybe dogs can teach old men new tricks. 
That is an awesome hat.  I need a hat like that.  I already have the grey beard.
Which one is the daughter?
It is too much for an old man like me, 10\10 would get crucified for this again 
Cheezus Christ,
 can’t we just enjoy this awesome pic?
Walt Whitman is that you? 
I like the hat. Where can I get one at? I'm not Google it.
I read this as the daughter had taught the dog to take selfies.
This makes me happy
Second picture is better than first i think
Goals
Is that Thoros of Myr?
Teach me your ways, Great Master! It is nearly impossible to get a selfie with my dog.
Holy shit! That's what happened?!
He looks like Thoros from Game of Thrones 
Hairy like her father!
*sigh* I need a dog in my life
Sprinters are just awesome!
Don't lie, that's Santa.
Floating dog head is adorable
She’s a spittin’ image of her dad.
Top 10 cutest things I’ve ever seen. They both radiate so much love and purity 😍😭😭
Hey santa :)
Your dad is the official selfie king

Everyone just stop posting selfies nothing ever beats this
We did the same thing with my mom and aunts.  They took a big vacation overseas and in all their pictures they just looked miserable and cranky.   We prescribed them one selfie a week so they could learn how to hold their face and fake smile.

OMG the whining.   They hated it, constant complaining.  When we learned to selfie there were no front facing cameras, they weren't even digital!  We'd just flip it around, blindly aim and hope for the best!  So there were many "back in my day" speeches to them!

A few months ago the three of them took the best selfie with my ailing grandma.  It was so adorable, totally worth months of complaining and bad selfies! 
Wholesome.
Oh my gosh, my heart! 😍
This guy should have an Instagram account. My feed would be even happier.
DOG LOVES YOU :D
That dog is the real hero we deserve.
Where does one find a hat like that?
He looks like the richest man I have ever seen. A loving daughter and family. Obviously there is a really good girl or boy best friend forever and a respectable beard. I'd vote for him. 
so cute
That guy is exactly like Eddie Marsan
I might frame this and put it on my wall. This dog... omg. Pure love xoxoxoxoxo Human must be a good man. 
The picture on the right is straight /r/GirlsMirin material
First time a millennial has done anything right
wait the one on the left isnt a painting?
What's his insta? 
Gandalf? 
I would frame this and put it up for sure. 
My pet is the only friend I want to take selfies with :)
This is the reasons we have selfies. 
These are ridiculously adorable. Well done, daughter!
Adorable!
My God. This dude is made of selfie midichlorians.
which one is the daughter? left or right?
Looks Thoros of Myr (Paul Kaye)

Thanks for sharing 😊
way to go daughter!

Did you teach him reddit too? or was he already using that?
awww adorable pictures... <3
That picture should be framed.
What a cute father-daughter photo
Why would y y need to teach anyone how to take a selfie...
This made me smile
How do you type with your paws?!

This is too cute. 
He looks like a Hobbit, from Hobbiton

This is soooo precious!!!!  I LOVE it so much
Oh gosh. Right in the feels
Learned how to take selfie. No need to change shirt anymore. 
Is it supposed to move but not moving? Hammer

Is it supposed to be still but moving? Duct tape

That's so nice 
They both look so happy! 
The loving Amish <3
This belongs to r/wholesomememes
Border collies are the single best dogs on the planet hands down for emotional support and friendship. If you've never owned one, please don't just buy one, you need two dogs to have them properly not destroy your home.
Give Gandalf his hat back, you thief!
Dad is adorable. 
These are such awesome photos!  Happy man, happy dog!! <3
I LOVE IT
So... which one is the dad?
I would totally frame this and put it on my wall. Just looking at both of these pictures puts me in a better mood. 
His one true love, fuck margret
"Blade of the immortal" flashbacks
She will treasure that photo for years to come
That dog be miring
That dog lol aww.
This made my day! 
Man I can't get my dogs to take pictures with me, but they'll lay all over my special lady friend...
I want this to be me in 30 years. More than pretty much anything.
This made me "Aww" outloud. 
Why do happy dads make me happier than happy moms?
Is that Red Green?
Just looking at this pic makes me smile even though the day has been shitty otherwise. I'm glad these two exist. 
The look of joy on that man's face is what i hope to someday feel
This is how i wanna be when I'm old
AWWWW!!! THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY AWWW ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
This is who I want to be when I grow up
They're both so happy :')
That's what selfies were made for. 
That's very sweet selfie there
Omg
Dogs are just too pure sometimes 😍
she really looks like her father
Get you someone who looks at you the way this dog looks at its owner.
Óðin n freki, 1000 bc colourized.

Daughter teaches dog how to take selfies, this is what happens
Man, this looks so much like my dad's Border Collie.  She was the smartest dog I'd ever met.  She looked at him with that some complete adoration.
Selfie of the year!!!
Radegast the Brown is looking a lot merrier than I remember.
Like it
Best friends! 
Best selfies ever.
The student becomes the master.
His daughter is a real dog.
Plot twist: The dog is her dad
That dog has seen too many pics of Miley Cyrus.

Best usage of selfies
Would a cat do this? No. 

I have nothing against cats. 
Dog people are MY people  <3 
Thoros of Myr is that you!
Australia mate!
I love this so much 
Notch, is that you?
Did she also teach the dog to take selfies? My dog, on the rare occasion that he is actually in the frame with my face for a selfie, always turns when I push the button.
whys she have a beard? and whys that dad look like that??
/u/booklegger326
"teaches"
