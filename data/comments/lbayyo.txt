How old do tigers live to be? On average
That poor girl has had a long life. Her teeth are rough, her eyes are bad but she is smiling.
And he’s not lion!
I didn't know tigers could write
Why is that Tiger so small?
That's grrreeeeat!!
One more year and he can drink with the zookeepers!
That’s grrrrrreat!!!!!
Hey, happy birthday! It's my birthday too!
Is she really small or is that sign big?
My Persian turned 18 two days ago. Named her Nermal, and her personality lived up to the name. Funny thing is I only found out years later Nermal, from Garfield where I got the name is actually a boy. But if you grew up watching Garfield and Friends, you'd think she was a girl cause that was definitely a girl who voiced him.

Wow Happy birthday you are absolutely beautiful 😍
Does she has cataract or something? Her eyes looks different.
There is some much smaller text at the bottom there.  Hard to make out but looks like “If you can read this you are about to see who the real Tiger King is”
Happy b day
Serious question, are predator type animals that go blind or lose significant ability to fend for themselves more docile?
Happy birthday!🎈
Happy Birthday, sweet Tiger Baby!!
Doesn't look a day over 5!
Those cataracts though.
A tiger in a zoo is monitored by an entire team who's only job it is to keep them alive and healthy. Meanwhile half the people in the world just let their cat run around outside and go nuts, and they still have a much longer lifespan on avenge.
 RIP whoever put that sign there
Is he blind or is that a camera flare
What a good kitty.  I bet he/she is hell on the furniture
Plot twist a guy visited the zoo holding this sign on his birthday trying to get people to congratulate him and then he met the tiger
Hi beautiful girl! I am 35 today! We are Groundhog Day sisters!
Happy birthday indira ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰
Happy birthday striped bean
Yooo, it's my cat's birthday too!
My reddit account shares a birthday with this tiger!
It's all awwww until you're picking up an arm.
Who is the fella brave enough to put the sign there?
Pog
She looks like a nice old lady
She deserves a nice treat, like a baby perhaps? Or just a whole person, she deserves it
Now that’s a geriatric tiger
Seems dangerous. I hope she has her bonded human now. Although her face looks happy imo.
Happy Birthday
beautiful smile
Meow

Happy Birthday beautiful! 🐯🎂💖
Whose job is it to approach the tiger and place the sign?
And very beautiful
Wow what a zoomer
Whose job do you think it was to lean a the sign against A GOD DAMN TIGER?
What a ham
Well you know what! Happy Birthday you beautiful beast
Hey Hey Happy Birthday!
I’ve always wanted to grow a tiger
Happy birthday!
Is it me, or does she still look like a juvenile?
Damn thats old
She was born on the same day as me! Just turned 20 today myself.
happy birthday. I love seeing your pic, but honestly I will not be brave enough to have a meeting with you :D
Why does she/he look so smol?
Happy Birthday Indira ! ❤️
Such a good job making this guy smile for the camera
Bless him/her
Happy cake day 🍰
Now stay off my lawn
Thaat's great!

She seems very small for a tiger
This tiger must be nearly blind with those cataracts.
Cat  years or Human
Happy birthday
Beautiful regardless of the age
happy birthday you
Happy birthday Indira! You’re still gorgeous, girl!
What kind of cat is that?
Damn this tiger learnt to write english too?!
Who had to put that sign there?
Wow! I just saw they usually only live for 10 - 15 years!
Why is the tiger blind? Does it have something to do with age?
Big Girl!!!!!  Happy Birthday 🎊🎉🎁🎂🎈
Do you count the stripes on the tail for the age?
hes a big boy now
She looks gggrrreeaatttt for 20!
Awwwwwwwwwww.
I’m 8 years cake today!
Happy birthday!!
Make sure not to have any perfume on your shoes
Good kitty
Those eyes
That's a big groundhog.
She looks really small, is she a dwarf?
Happy birthday beautiful one!! 🎂
Lol we share a birthday!
Happy birthday 🐈‍⬛
Happy Birthday :)
How old was the person who put the sign there?
Happy Birthday!
Looks like that stuffed animal I had when I was a kid
Can vets not fix cataracts with the lasers like they do in people?
Woa. Can you talk too?
when’s the ama?
Doesnt look a day past inbred
Who put that sign there? ....And lived?
Is there something wrong with her eyes? They seem off to me but then again I don't see too many tigers in roaming in Canada
as pretty as a cat and as happy as a dog , what a champ .
Oh my goodness happy birthday!! Look at you ya lil fighter!
AWWW!! SO cute!!!
Happy birthday you big ol puddy tat 😻
I thought she was a soft toy
Happy Birthday to the most beautiful boy 😊
Happy birthday Indira!
Happy birthday!
Their lives are insanely short. I always thought size was directly proportional to lifespan for some reason.
Happy birthday
Happy Birthday!
:0
Eye!!!!!!🕸️🎇🕸️
And as majestic as ever!!!!!
I needed this today, enjoy the gold
Look at that smile!
I can’t tell if it’s a stuffed animal or an animal that’s been stuffed.
Happy birthday
Freaking awesomeness
How are you able to get up close with them?

Such a bootiful smile!
Weirdest dog shaming post I've seen in a while.

I share a bday with a tiger. Dope.
Happy Birthday pretty girl!

How did they get the sign there?
This tiger is seeing the citywide cell phone sonar images on WayneTech display contact lenses.

Birthday twins! Happy birthday!
Is that old for a Tiger?
Awwww 🎁🎈💕❤️
Tiger 😱😱🥰
Still wouldn’t be the poor bastard who was sent to put the sign there. That tiger looks like it’s fucked, but might be secretly wanting to go out wild style.
❤
That’s great penmanship for a 20 year old blind tiger
here’s to 8 more life’s
Bet the tiger didn’t write the sign
Today?!! Today is my birthday too!!! Happy birth day indira!!!
Awwww her blind eyes!!!
Hey Happy Birthday! Be a happy and healthy..

Happy Birthday sher !! 🐅🎉
Happy birfday!!!
For a second it looked like a r/roastme
Insert aging crying guy meme*
He deserves some DOGECOINS
She’s as old as I :o

qt 😼❤️❤️❤️
This is amazing and I’m so proud of her! Tigers don’t usually live that long and the fact that she’s completely blind, too! 


Also I don’t wanna sound mean but I just have to say it, she kinda looks like that pic of the rubber tiger...
who’s a good kitty? 

you are! yes! 

say, you’re a big kitty.

nope. i’ll stay over here. we cool. (walks quickly to the door)

[tires squealing]
Wondering who drew the short straw to place the sign?
Happy Birthday 🎂
Looks like a kitten still
Happy birthday beautiful girl! 🎉🐯
My first thought was dang he's older than me, and then I realized I'm 23
What kind of dog is that?
That tiger has neat handwriting.
Old ass tiger.. sorry thought this was “roast me”
Happy birthday🎉🎈. Am going to make an appointment to come and visit. Have never heard of Zambi Wildlife Retreat
Beware of dog they said
I've read enough comics to know that tiger possess great supernatural wisdom.

“hang on a second-“
Happy birthday!

They're a big blind puddin', and I love them, even though they could fucking obliterate me.
She looks way too small...
Happy Happy Furday to you!!!  Live longer!!
We have the same birthday🎉
Ok nature is pretty fucking lit, but you can't convince me a BLIND tiger wrote what's on that paper.
Surprised they don't don't cataracts surgery. They do it for dogs these days.
Ahw
Poor guy has cataracts...
HBD🥳🥳🥳❤️
he older than me lol, i am 18's
They are beautiful
Such a cutie
!atraco
Giant kitty
I'm not Tigrrred,   I'm just resting🐯
This tiger is so old it could have gone to a linkin park concert during their peak fame.
Lucky for the person who sneaked up to put that sign up against her.  She's blind...
It could have been a different outcome if not.
Happy Birthday!
but he still a floor gang   
\*aaaaaaahhhhhhuuuuuu\*
Hope the caretakers treat her to a wonderful birthday and everyday after that
Don’t look a day over ten
I know the relative equation for cat years vs. people years.  However this is a very large cat, and if treated (vs. Wild in Nature) with the best of conditions,  it should last a good deal longer.
Beautiful animal!
scary and cute at the same time
Hey, same!
Weird cat shaming but okay.
Kitty ketty ketty... here kitty ketty ketty kitty
She looks so happy. I wanna hug her. Pretty kitty
I can tell
my chihuahua dachshund is 13, missing teeth and also completely blind. this picture warms my heart.
Wow he can write, such talent
Happy cake day to youuuuuuu!
His eyes looks white, is he blind or is it just the age
Congrats
How long do they live??? I always imagine like, 30-40 years, but I guess that? When I think about it, probably around the same as regular cats, right? So only like 15ish years... man that makes me feel sad, cuz those are such beautiful animals! make their life all the more precious! Happy birthday, anyway :)
Diamond eyes!
She looks happy to leave r/teenagers
Happy birthday!!
Hey I know that Tiger. Congrats indira
Happy Birthday!

Hi I have spent 20 years in captivity I wonder how much the people that feed me have made do you think they could afford a bigger enclosure

You don’t look at day over five
Happy birthday! I made the number of comments 667 because no one's cursing us on this blessed day! Not today Satan!
Is the tiger small or is that a huge sign?

I am same age as that lion
I thought tigers lived 60 years.  Was that ever true?
Poor tiger!! I feel bad because he is blind.
God Bless HER! I see that she is blind, cataracts? SHE is certainly a GRAND DAME!!
Happy bday tony !

Hello "20 years old today"!

Glad to see you're doing well :)
Aww missing one of her teefies
Tyger tyger burning bright, In the forest of the night, What immortal hand or eye would frame thy fearful symmetry?
Is she a Royal Bengal Tiger, it is the pride of India and Bangladesh. I am from India with Bangladeshi heritage.
Aww! She's smiling... melts my ❤
Animals in captivity are more sad than cute.
And before I die, I’d like to be free once again.
Aw she's the goodest girl
Shes very cute! I love her!
Vegans would have us believe that this is animal cruelty.  But take note of the fact that this giant kitty is living to 20 years old, has a very easy life, has no chance of starving, is loved by human beings, and get regular scratches every day.

Oh, I forgot to mention that he/she plays all day long.
beautiful smile
Pog
He's lion.
Big fucking deal I turned 20 years ago

If this is aww I could post my dog panting and get 30k upvotes

Think you could fuck up a 20 y/o tiger? Not like actually just hypothetically
Big kitty
