*Spend all my time waiting*

*For that dinner snack*

*For the meal that*

*will make it OK*

For pennies a day, YOU could feed Miles!

Give today.
Get off Reddit! He’s wasting away!
*"Food is three minutes late. That's it; I'm never getting fed again."*
I worked at an animal shelter when I was in high school. We fed the cats twice a day. Dry food in the morning and a mix of dry and wet food in the evening. They loved their wet food and learned the schedule really quick. When it got close to dinner time they all howled. Kinda funny.
He’s adorable. What breed it he? He looks like a German Shepard/Husky mix.
My Miles is currently pouting because he only got a little bit of carnitas juice mixed in his kibble.
"Look at me...wasting away to practically nothing.. " - Miles and Ursula.
you monster.

Keeshond? I'm surprised he wasn't attached to your side. 

I had three of them growing up, and they were always touching someone. Whatever room you decided to move to, they got up and moved with you, and wouldn't lay down until they were sure you'd stay there.
Father, why have you forsaken me?!
"I collapsed from starvation. I hope you're happy now."
Poor baby! 😂
I swear all our dogs were soccer players in a past life the way they fake it. :)
Poor poor hound. I don't know how he survived it
Oh the YOU MANity
We pray he will pull through this and live a long life. You absolute cad. /s
3 minutes??? You MONSTER!!!
Keeshond? If so i had two growing up and loved everything but the hair constantly on my clothes lol. Rarely see this breed out much anymore
This is my favorite caption of the week!! Made me laugh big time!!
 #milesstrong 🙏❤
God, I hope he makes it! Let us know!
My view shows 18 comments and no upvotes? Dog is a cutiepetudy lol
OP had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
He is beautiful and so dramatic. You'll have to buck up on keeping to schedule, no slacking when it comes to his routine.
Too cruel. Poor Miles.
Thoughts and prayers
YOU CAN’T GET FULL ON THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS, BILL OR LINDA
You know it’s bad when your fur baby will make you second guess yourself if you fed her or not .
God I love keeshonds!
You monster!!!!
Poor baby.... but he has excellent pouting skills!!
Oh my! Look at Miles. He’s just skin and bones now.  I hope you gave an extra cookie so he made his way up those stairs. Looks like all is lost. 😂
I gibe big pray 🙏 he big starvin
Shame!
We have had two Keeshonds, both female. This pic reminds me how much I miss having one around. (Expensive and hard to find now...)
Poor thing 💔🥺
He's wasting away!
Savage!!!
You monster!
You best be putting the pedal to the metal on miles food.
Dang you had me in the first half ngl
Oh the dogmanity. Shame, shame
I've contacted PPS (Pupper Protective Services)

I hope they hang you out to dry.
Thanks a lot Sarah McLachlan. I can only cling to the shred of hope that he made it - but even that is far fetched.
LOL...how dare you be 3 minutes late with pupper's dinner! Get a grip and be a better parent why don't you!
Miles is gonna report you to the ASPCA.
Oh my heck he cant even make it down the stairs hes so low on energy. Im calling CPS
🎶 *In the arms of an angel...* 🎶

*"Millions of animals throughout America go hungry like this every day."*
We had a Keeshond when I was a kid...Moose.  Great dogs!
Omg...chuckling here!
I can't believe you op. Precious Bois need to eat immediately, or their floof gets fluffed.
Feeling. So. Weak. Tell my mother I love her. I probably won’t make it.
How dare you do such a thing on National Pet Day!
😂😂 your hound is a drama queen like my babies
Oh the Dogmanity!!!
\#forçaguerreirinho u/psychopeanutbutter
Your comment and his picture made me laugh.
If Miles were a cat, he would have chewed your favorite plant and peed on everything you love for not feeding him 2 hours early.
Dog's stomachs get just as spoiled as our own. We could survive for 30 days without food but our stomachs start to through a tantrum after a few hours. Spoiled
that is a seriously majestic creature 😍😍😍
Keeshond?
lol
I love the I’m so clearly healthy but an expert at making myself look spent for food, attention. I’m also well versed in this language
Is he a Keeshond?!
What’s wrong with you?!  Feed him!
He's going to need intensive therapy he looks very depressed. Or a few cookies
so fluffy
Unacceptable. Worst owner ever. Call pet services
Tell Miles I named my cats thoughts and prayers because they are useless.
How will the poor thing ever get the strength to make it to his food dish?
"I'm wasting away... heckin starving"
First of all, how dare you?

Do you understand the suffering Miles has just been through. It was a tough one, he almost didn't make it. 

Poor Miles.
Miles send s.o.s when you need food we will airdrop doggy food. Along with a bone.
I have many questions. First of all, how dare you?
Drama Queen?
I'm reporting this to animal services.
You monster.
Tragic😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
SEND HELP GOSH DANGIT !
i made an account 3 seconds ago and i already wanna cry lol

YOU MONSTER
Ohhhhhhh Lawd !!! Doggie guilt..
It's the worst😍
You monster!
Hurry up dude, he’s MELTING!
Life’s so hard
Hurry! He is starving!!!
Jeeeeeze!!! Hey, can you tag this with an NSFW!?  That poor thing is wasting away to nothing! He's just fur and bones!!
Insert Patrick's "Now I'm gonna starve D:"
Keeshond? Beautiful!
On National Pet day too? Oh, the horror! I don’t know how Miles will ever forgive you? 😂😂
First off, how dare you...
Truly a tragic day in history
Omg he's adorable! 😍😍♥️💘🥰

Oh I hope he’ll make it
He’s STARVING. What the fuck is wrong with you.
How DARE you! That poor thing is all skin and bones! 😂

You cold heartless bastard
So dramatic! 😂
You cad. You utter utter cad.  How could you!!!!!!?
^^^... ^^^still ^^^waiting ^^^bitch
My best friend as a kid was a Keeshond named Scarlet, she had a red tinge through her coat. Beautiful breed.
Is that a Keeshond?!
How could you?!? Poor fella. 3 minutes he has to suffer wondering when his next meal will be. Clearly a neglected, starving guy pursuing a career in acting!
"hooman has abandoned me...I have been forgotten"
Half way up the stairs is the place where I sulked..........
3 min late? Bro ur starving him.
he is fucking DEAD
Oh man, this is my dog every morning and night too. He’s more reliable than any alarm clock I could buy.
You know what they say, a miss is as good as a miles.
3 minutes late to take this photo
that's almost half an hour in dog minutes
[deleted]
nice stairs
First of all - how dare you?
He’s wasting away!
I can relate to this!
Permanent trauma!
Keeshond?
That’s like 2 days in dog years for him he misses you
Poor thing!
Hi, I’m reporting you to PETA.
RIP in pieces
Intermittent Fasting
Aww. Is that a Shiloh Shepherd?
Press F to pay respects to Miles  
F
Poor puppy how dare you he’s clearly half dead
Had us the first half...
THREE MINUTES!?!

WHAT A HORRIBLE PARENT!!

CLEARLY A MALNOURISHED FLOOF!

YOU DON'T DESERVE MILES!!

...Omggggg how cute is he!?
Had a Keeshond growing up; he was such a good dog!
SO deprived. Poor floof.
you've failed me for the last time Martha, I'm done for
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie.
Keeshond right? Cute!
[Poor Miles.](https://youtu.be/Xw1C5T-fH2Y)  OP better up his game.
you MONSTER
The audacity!
Lol! I actually set an alarm so I'm not late giving my cats their treats! Not that I need to.. they know...
RIP

For real tho, my grandparents always had a dog, apparently only kept german shepherds and a few shelties, all of them had an acute sense of time. Down to the minute. If it was chow time, you heard about it. The sheltie was something of a dog genius—he’d let them know when it was time to pick up the kids from school, among other things.
Poor boi. Someone feed him, quick!! And belly rubs. Allllll the belly rubs.
Ts and Ps
How? How could you do such a thing?
He’s melting!!!!
Beautiful Keeshond. Had one growing up, best dog ever.
You can see his bones! You monster!!
There better be a belly rub after this miscarriage of dog ownership
My guy just stares at me and jedi mind tricks me until I feed him.
This is the best post I've seen all day take my poor man gold! 🥇🥇
How could you be so heartless? I'm dying of hunger...
I'm curious what your Yelp rating is.
Stay strong Miles!
Can anyone confirm Miles made it???
Is that a chow chow? Inside keeshond owner joke. Lol
I’m calling animal services on you. Child services also
HOW DARE YOU?! Poor pupper is wasting away! Shame on you!
We have only ever heard our dog bark four times. Each time, it was something that we were not doing quickly enough.
Hang tuff little pup!
why is this front page??
Aww look at him!  I hope he gets extra.  I'd be a terrible pet parent.
Quit screwing around and feed that pupperoo, OP!
Is this a Keshond?
Head towards the light Miles!
You are Satan personified.
Dude you had me in the first half ngl..
Thought he was dead ;(
My wife cooked food for our dogs last night... My shepherd threw such a tantrum because she put it out side to cool down. He stood by the door making a racket yelping like I'm we are abusing him.
She cooked because she is awesome and our shepherds have certain food allergies and he is have skin flare ups
He will surely die
My Pomeranian is named Miles! First time I’ve seen another dog with the same name as him! Now please, give Miles his food!!

PS: I also have a Keeshond (Pablo), they’re the best dogs!
He’s not gonna make it.
That was too funny!!!
I love keeshonds!
oh, Miles! You are so adorable!
This is the most disturbing thing I have seen. 
Pre dinner- you’re PAWthetic
Post dinner- you’re PAWsome
Pots and plates full of food for him please.
My dogs would have chewed through the cabinet by now!
RIP Miles. May we remember how patient he was while he waited 5 years to be fed while he wasted away.
How dare you
Three minutes.

Consider yourself lucky. If I'm three seconds late my cat never shuts up until they get food
This is Miles default state I'm betting
Is that a Keeshond? Finally my favorite breed getting some recognition!
You monster.
Yo is he gonna make it?
You're lucky.  Mine never lets me forget with many wines and barks within +/- 5 min of her normal feeding time.  She has a crazy good internal clock.  The switches from daylight savings to regular time are tougher for her than they are for me!
Barely hanging on, I see.
Keeshond?
Hold on Miles! You can make it!
Three minutes late and Miles is already sick of your bullshit
German Sheperd or Malanois?
why u do this!
https://youtu.be/fT8MSNmNcLM
Wow, way to parent... I can’t believe this.
Sad pup
Ohhh the melodrama! I get it from my pups too. Keeshonds are so adorable
Poor thing. Such woe
Dog may die
Had me in the first half
Legs need untwisting too hungry can’t figure out. fronts are backs? is foots to twist up stairs for food or the harder down? or why head smash is not food in bowl sound.
Oh the humanity!
How could you? I just cannot.... stay strong Miles.
Oh man I read the first sentence and saw the pic and I got scared cuz I thought he died
You are a savage. What a burden for that poor pup.
You heartless bastard
RIP fren
His name would be Kilometers if you both traveled to the UK.
🤣
He’s not gonna make it.
You utter disgrace of a dog dad/Mum feed that hound!
Despair and misery...
Oh that fluffy drama queen.
It's tots and pears, both of which he needs like yesterday
What kinda dog is that? Mine looks like him
Stunning and brave
Three whole minutes, you awful person
FML!
Hey my name is Miles too!
Seeing this made me remember I hadn't given my cat dinner yet. I went to do so and found her lying beside her food bowl, sulking.
This was supposed to be his forever home!
🙏🙏🙏
Lol!  They’re the best pals!
miles I am here for you in these trying times
Stop taking the damn photo and feed Miles!
r/RebelsFleet join the REBELLION.
Did he make it? Is he ok now?
What. The. Fuck. Is. Your. Problem.
I hope he pulls through.
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
Deserves an Oscar lol
OP he's gonna *staaarrrrve*!!
The poorest of all the puppers.
My Archie does the same thing., so I understand miles.
Ennui.
The [song](https://youtu.be/qp6OYBSEYg4) that's playing in the background
You had me in the first half, not gonna lie. :(
At first I thought the title said that Miles would be dead in three minutes
Somewhere out there Sarah McLachlan is already doing a voice over for his commercial.
He looks a bit like [my boy](https://i.imgur.com/v3IXqf0.jpg)! :D
Daylight saving time has my fur buddy and screwed up he just can't get on board with this time change.
Awwww a keeshond. My old boy Tango was a Keeshond. RIP. He was a super sweet fluffy boy. Yours is a cutie.
We're going to need everybody's hopes and prayers to get him fed, because of the mass injustice that has befallen this poor fellow.
You monster.
You need to hurry the fuck up!!
I’m calling the cops.. poor pupper
Is this what “Hello Darkness, my old friend” looks like?
Doctor is he going to make it?
happy doggo day!
U fucking monster how could you
It’s hard being a dog.
I had a dog with that same name, he was a black pug, and lived to be 16! He was named after miles Davis, so Davis was his middle name. My prayers go out to Miles in these trying times.
How dare you!
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half.
If he survives this, he can survive anything!
At least you weren't many kilometers away!
Did he live?
[Why am I still here? Just to suffer?](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)
What kind of dog is this? I love him
Hang in there, Miles.
And you stopped to take a photo? 😱 for shame!!
He's skin stretched tightly over a skeleton, you cruel person, you!  How dare you starve this dog like that! /s
you monster
Neglect!!!! A whole three minutes? Inexcusable!
Poor unfortunate soul
1 upvote = 1 prayer
Hurry up!!
THEN STOP TAKING PICTURE AND GIVE HIM HIS DAMN FOOD
What took you so long human?
r/dogsareliquid
I’ve always thought, people don’t eat twice a day, why does a dog?  Why not three times a day?
Thoughts and prayers
Oh no!  The travesty of it all!  Lol
Poor pupper!! 😨

Why wasn’t there a trigger warning!? 🤣
Our Labradoodle used to shoehorn herself into a step like that, it was really cute.
Bless him/her in the deprived wait hope him/her will make it.Gods Speed little one.
I feel so terrible for miles.  Poor puppers.  Get well soon, I hope you recover from this tragedy.  He probably loves you more than ever though with that sweet face
I was so scared something bad had happened. Turns out I was right.
Don’t be any longer or you might become his dinner...
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
Tots and pears, little homie.
Well Karen, it's 21 dog minutes. I can't stay hungry for that long.

Edit: even though this is my original comment, I'm 21 dog hours late before someone posted same calculations. :)
My akita and pit literally run back and forth from their crate to the kitchen when I’m getting their bowls ready, last time my puppy tripped me and dropped the food everywhere but of course her being the vacuum she is I didn’t have to clean
[Snoopy did it well](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=JEBFdHJIl-Y&t=8s), but your baby's just so friggin cute!
My dog's get kibble with bone broth and when they don't they get super pissy. I fully feel you.
Is he being a big baby??
I brought a Dog back from South Dakota that looks just like that! It was a ferrel dog that I have no idea what bread it is!!! Have u dna tested your dog?!? If not, what kind of dog do you think it is ?
Now you're even more late for taking his picture. It's about time you stop your bullshit Karen. Just feed the damn dog!
Poor baby,! Feed him!
Come on..mama..dieing here...
Norwedgian Elkhound?
So FLUFFY!!!
r/nonononoyes
My poor old dog had a dinner time of 6:30 even though he got hungry at 4:15 every night. He just waited patiently. These new young assholes, can’t make it if they don’t get fed by 4:30.
how devastating
Did... did he live?
HOW COULD you
is that a keeshond!!
I’m also a Miles!
It looks enjoyable
He’s such a beautiful little drama queen!
huuuman... why are you taking pictures instead of feeding me? huuumaaaaaan!
Bro I fr thought he was dead💀💀
looks like he is slowly dying .
You monster.
How could you!?
He’s not gonna make it. Call a doctor. 
Need snacks stat.
you monster!!!!
Gosh dang it Jerry this isn't a joke!
This is the only acceptable time to give thoughts and prayers.
This is hysterical
Wow, pretty serious.
How could you?! That is a beautiful doggo...Lucky hooman!
Poor boi
Unlike my dog who when I let him in hours after his normal feeding time didn't give two fucks about his food bowl he just wanted to jump on the couch and spin around
Pet the dog please.
Alexa, please play Angel by Sarah McLaughlin.
I’ve seen this photo before. Repost??
HOW DARE YOU
How dare you.
How dare you? He is obviously withering away?! 😂😂
Oh that’s awful.  Prayers on there way!
You feed that baby ON TIME!!
which angle should i view the fucking inage from
What an atrocity. r/iamatotalpieceofshit
Miles knows clock. You no know clock like Miles.
who are you feeding it to?
This is the appropriate use of 'thoughts and prayers'.
Typical millennial! Taking photos of tragedies instead of running for ~~your~~ his life
r/donthelpjustfilm
Had me worried in the first half
Famished
I was very happy when I realised Miles was not dying
Mother???  Is ...that ...you...?
Stop wasting time taking his picture and feed the damn dog!
You should be arrested.
This picture needs [a musical soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZD_854t5jg).
How dare you starve such a good boy?! 

Nurse!! The patient has crashed. Get me 100cc of noms, stat!!
I’ve come back several times to laugh at Miles. Thanks.
You monster.
Sending good vibes
Today we got the business from Charlie “Bisket” for being late with his dinner! He didn’t shut up until he saw one of us come to his cabinet to get his food! Yikes!!!!!
That’s me!
He should be called five-miles. So you can tell people “I’m doing five-miles”
What kind of monster are you??!
How will he survive please hurry and feed him
Hang in there miles I've sent red cross a box of greenines to tide you over this grave injustice
Tiered all the Time ? Exercise More than 90% studies show it effectively relieves fatigue 😄
My bones also evaporate when I’m a couple minutes late for dinner. You got this, miles!
Mister Hooman I dont't feel so good
FEED THE GOOD BOI!
How COULD you?!?! Can’t you see that he’s wasting away?! Poor thiiiing! (heh)
You’re a monster
“Somebody call the dog warden and tell him Miles has gone 3 minutes without food!”
Awww what a cutie. Dogs are the best/worst when you’re late. I got home later than usual tonight and the second I walked in the door my little doofus was herding me in to kiss my wife so I’d take him for a walk. He knows I always kiss her before we leave, and is the whiniest when he doesn’t get his way lol
RIP Miles, can’t get good staff these days
I think he's died of starvation.
Local Dog has Never Been Fed in Entire Life, claims Local Dog. XD
"I can't do this more Linda pls just respect my basic demands"
How dare you hooman stop take photo give din din
You monster. He’s gonna starve!
poor miles
Might as well be miles away.
Don't you know they weaken and die within 5 minutes of a missed mealtime?🤣🤣🤣
"Are you happy, Stella? I'm dying over here!"
Hire someone if you dknt have the time to properly care for your pets. /s
"The horror!"
STOP TAKING PICTURES AND GET THAT GOOD DOGGO HIS FOOD
So what’s it like being the clone of both Hitler and Stalin? Cause that’s clearly the reason you could be this evil. /s
Well get a move on we can't have him wasting away
One star.
Weak with hunger. Lol.
I can COMPLETELY relate!
Teach miles about intermittent fasting.
'It's okay, I know, you don't really love me anymore, if you ever did.'  *sniff*.
Tots and pears.
I’ve also got a keeshond, Ruby. When her dinner is late she hops around like an insane dog.
Goodbye, cruel world...
Definitely a mood 😂
Lol he looked so weak and pitiful.  Three minutes is like a month in dog years.
This is unacceptable
And here my half shepherd doesn't give two shits about his food
Miles is thinking that he needs to have a talk with you about getting your priorities straight
Stop taking a picture and hecking feed your dog
I thought I was the only one with an Emo dog.
Hang in there Miles
I love him.
Typical social media parents, too busy posting photos of their fur babies for clout while neglecting them
Read rule #1. Reporting to admins.
Thoughts and prayers are with you. Big society will never understand, even when actions like these come as part and parcel of living in it. Ownership of pets is not fit for purpose amongst all pet owners, though I assume there are fine people on both sides and as such have come under a spell of an overwhelming desire to march in solidarity with all pet owners.
My dog isn't a good dog. I just make sure there is food in the bowl and he eats when he wants. No time basis. No morning or night designated times to eat. No late fees. I love my dog and his ways. With a dog door on the back, a large bowl full of food, and a water bowl with a 5 gallon jug to fill it when it goes empty, my dog lasts a week with no human interaction. Self sufficient. Good dog
Here he can have a warm glass of shut the hell up to hold him over until he gets dinner
