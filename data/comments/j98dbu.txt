When I was in middle school and would take my saxophone home to practice, the dog and cat would sit at my feet and howl/yowl along when I hit certain notes.  I vaguely remember F# being one they really liked.  This was pre-internet, pre-camera phones, etc., but damn that would have made a cute video for r/aww.
I would like two more hours of this please.
I've heard this one before. 

"Howl at the Moon, ft. Eagle Beagle."
So cute! Probably sees his owners do it all the time and wanted to see what it was about
That is just too perfect! My dog heard him baying (that HAS to be a beagle!) and joined right in 😍

Leave the radio on to an easy listening or classical music station when you go out so your pup has something to make him feel less anxious and fearful and more relaxed when he is left alone.

Super cute, but the owner is definitely there. Just a random camera at the perfect spot? The dog also keeps looking at the camera?

Honestly, considering the dog probably does not actually understand how to play a piano properly, he’s doing a pretty good job.

Also had a beagle that'd howl when the piano was played.


This is definitely different.

To the comments complaining that this is trained behavior:

I have cared for and obedience trained nearly a dozen rescues of various breed mixes in my life. 

That this is wholly trained behavior is much _less_ plausible to me than the explanation that this is behavior the beagle had developed on its own, and its owners had observed it and placed the camera to capture it. I question if the pup was truly alone when this happened (I suspect that's a narrative which the OP uploader here invented), but everything else about it is plausible. Beagles can be freaky clever (also independent-minded, sometimes making them difficult to train), and they seem to genuinely _enjoy_ howling.

Considering the camera is set up right where a music stand would otherwise be, I have to assume the owners expected this behavior.

We had a minuture Schnauzer that would howl her little heart out during renditions of happy birthday . I always wanted to do a skit saying to the family  look if you don't sing you don't get any cake and part way through singing pan to little Maggie howling away . And finish with her getting her piece .

Now in negotiations for a record deal, world tour.
My dogs used to sit under my feet and fall asleep when I’d be producing music in my bedroom...but god forbid I wanted to record vocals...they’d be singing right along with me, every time. I eventually needed to cut vocals at a studio to get work done. I don’t have them anymore, but I do miss this.
Shit! It doesn't sound that bad either
He has such a way with words..
Little do the owners know, he’s making fun of them
