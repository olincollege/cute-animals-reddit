Didn't even bother turning around, just turned upside down. ♡♡♡♡
Is there a sub for when animals look at you upside down like this? My parents dog does this sometimes and it's adorable. 
🙃
"hi there, forget something? Scritches need to be scratched, please!"
The look I give my hairdresser when I ask her to please massage my head when she shampoos. (Hair dresser is also best friend. So it usually works) 
My Brittany does the same.  No amount of petting is enough to satiate her scritchy needs. 

Beautiful Dog!
Is that a Welsh Springer Spaniel? Love the color on that coat, I had a Welshie growing up. 
Whoever said “Dogs can’t look up” was either a moron or a troll. 
This must be a Brittany thing cause mine does the exact same thing lol
🙃"Excuse me?"🙃
10/10 very boopable snoot.
I didn't even wait for the gif to load before I knew I was going to up vote this
My dog does this and it cracks me up every single time 
Its a Brittany dog breed!!! My dog is a Brittany, she looks like this only a bit chunkier :)
I think sorting by new is the new strategy to see the cutest things.
My husky does something similar when I stop petting him. 

He usually just sneezes in my face though, so it’s a lot less cute. 
My pup used to do the same thing, must be a Brittany thing.  Miss that look.
My dobies favorite move. Busted my nose one good time, now I know how to avoid it; keep my face pressed against his. 
That whole setup is fancy as fuck. Including the dog. 
My dog does the same thing!

Pfft... Who said dogs can't look up!
My cat does the same thing lol
I was having a bad day today, so when I went or Reddit (mobile) and checked my notifications and saw "is everything alright? Why did you stop?" I got really happy because I thought that Reddit was checking up on me. At first when I saw the puppy, I was disappointed, but now I think it is kinda funny lol.
I think your dog might be a little possessed. I would give em an exorcism just to be safe.
r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog
I certainly didn't expect that
Dogs are so funny.
This is impossible, everyone knows dogs cant look up
Leading him on like that constitutes for animal abuse
This is the sweetest thing I've seen all day 😊
Only me who have done that myself? 
That head flip, tho!
That mother F'r would've got kissed in the mouth with the quickness.
"Hi! I need you to keep going"
Yeah, but big Al also said dogs can't look up.
Oh god my heart
Very cute. 
what a cute freckled pup
Dogs can look up. Confirmed.

This dog has an IQ of 300.
My boss's dog puts her nose under my wrist and forces it off my keyboard to that I will give her pets. 

As soon as I try to go back to work, she does it again. 

It's my favorite work break of the day. 
So many years ago...circa 1981...I brought home a six-week-old yellow tabby kitten that someone else had brought into the office where I worked because her parents wouldn't let her keep him. My Mom at first held firm to her "No pets!" stance, but after a few weeks Sparky was suddenly her shadow and her "baby". (I guess cats are intuitive when it comes to sucking up to the proper person...) Anyway, we had an old Wurlitzer electric piano in our basement, and that's where Mom used to go to play when she wanted to relax. Mom never learned to read sheet music and played strictly by ear and hitting the black keys was just a little too technical for her, so her version of, say "Come Back to Sorrento" had a happy lilt to it, since she'd adapted it to all white keys. I'd longed mocked her version of piano playing, but Sparky for some reason was absolutely mesmerised by it. There was an old table stacked with various junk right behind Mom's piano chair, and once she started playing, he'd curl up on that table. When Mom eventually dozed off (as she always did after half an hour or so....she always "played herself to sleep"), Sparky would poke-poke-poke her with his paw to wake her up. He wanted more "music", darn it!!
My cat does the same thing and it will lick you until you finally pet it
ohhh this totally made my day :)
I could litterally feel my heart melt,
Today has been really hard on me cuz of my depression... this made me feel happiness for the first time today. Thanks OP!
So dogs *can* look up.

My dog does this too! So cute!
My cat does this to me, and I swear she knows exactly how to get more scritches.

“Hoooman I require more petting”
I didn't say you  could stop petting, hooman. 
I have a Brittany too!
That is one flexible pooch neck.
So stinking cute!
Literally made me go, “awwww oh my god” I love springers so much. Makes me miss my boy Odie. 
Hehe
When a dog bends over backwards to look at you is one of the greatest little pleasures in life.
This is exactly what my Springer does!!! Too cute!!!
Story of my life. Right hand on the dog and left on the cat. When I stop both look up at me!  It’s the best though. :) 
I love him so much
He'd be getting all the chin rubs after a move like that :-)
What did I just witness?! Big Al said dogs can't look up!
Thank you reddit notifications
Thats a CGI dog.

Everyone knows dogs can't look up.  
Man, I really love dogs.
Lmao so ADORABLE 
it's a classical move by dogs to do, lol
Test
Thats a lot of fireplace wood right there
Shaft head tilt is strong on this one
Brittany Spaniel?? My dad is obsessed with the breed and we’ve only had them growing up. He’s on his 4th one now. 
I thought dogs couldn’t look up.
Lol
Why talk about cats when it’s the dog that’s making noise? My cats are listening. 
My dog Charlie would do this! He's been gone 2 years this July, and is dearly missed, please give your pup an extra scratch for me <3
This is the cutest thing that I've seen all day. 
‘Now do the underside!’
We aren’t worthy! 😭😭
LOL I love when my dog does this. Cute little mutts.
Upsidehound.
when the head goes back, thats when you have to stroke their neck and under the chinny chin chin.
Brittany.  Best dog ever!
Dog: yo what's up \*turns head over to the back\*
Is that a brittany? My boy does stuff like this all the time if you leave him hanging.
How'd you get a hold of my dog?
FAKE!  Dog's can't look up.
Oh my goodness! This is one of the cutest things I've seen. It definitely made my day!
God I love dogs
Omg
wait, so dogs *can* look up?
My Brittany does the exact same thing!

Is there a sub for doppelganger dogs? Like... This is my dog, looks and mannerisms, I want my dog to meet his doppelganger!
why does this remind me of the amazon alexa dog collar super bowl commercial?something tells me this pupper gets everything it ever wants. 
Perfect opportunity to rub under the mouth!
Always thought dogs couldn’t look up..
r/brittanyspaniel
“Dogs can’t look up” questioning all of my life up until now...
What a flexible doggo!
Is that a brittany? :O
My dog will do the exact same thing😂😂 but he will look at me like I'm a monster 
One of my dogs used to do this too, but when he did it he'd have his mouth open and his tongue lolling out the side of his mouth while he did it lol.
That's so cute I wish I had a dog
Dog : keep petting me 
she looks like our dog who we dont know her breed. whats this fellow’s breed my guy?_
Your doggo becomes an aussie when you dont scratch
Is that a Brittany?
"dogs can't look up"
BRITTANY!

OMG YOU ARE UPSIDE DOWN!!!!

Well I’m not a dog person, but this is bloody cute!
Oh how cute
I was under the impression that dogs can’t look up.
Wait!!! I thought dogs can’t look up.
My dog does this all the time and then I rub his chin 
lol my dog does this 
I thought dogs couldn't look up. 
I want to post in this thread so I have a reply to send to people that try to convince me that dogs can't look up.

I call that the "Poltergeist". Kinda unnerving when a dog with large mouth flaps decides to go horror on you.

Big Al says "Dogs can't look up."
My dog used to come up to me when I was sitting on the couch and lay his head on my lap. You’d go to pet him and he’d pull his head away the moment you touched him. Weirdest animal I swear. 
Somebody better tell Big Al he was wrong and dogs CAN look up!
Awwww dont stop
If a human did that I would probably flip tf out
It must be a Spaniel thing.  My ESS's made that same adorable upside down face!
I love puppos! Is this a Brittany spaniel? Had a mix that looked very similar— she was the best puppo!
Dogs can look up.
Be still my heart, I love Brittany’s so much. I grew up with one and she was the sweetest soul I’ve ever met. 
Hooman, you must continue scratching my fluffy head
Dogs really know how to get what they want. Just. By. Lookin. CUTE.
Me rubbing my girls back😏
Mine does this too
When I stop petting my dog, she immediately nuzzles and prods around me until she forces her head underneath my hand again
But dogs can’t look up! 
Is a spaniel thing! My springer does this. 😂

I love that dogs can turn their heads that way.
That's truly the most efficient path, as the crow flies.

Time for chin scritches now
So. Freaking. Adorable.
Pretty sure this solves Nick Frost and Simon Peggs argument in Sean of the dead.
The double ear flops killed me. Oh my gosh. 
Mine does the same thing. hehe
Your dog matches your decor!
Lol
Now scratch the chinz.
Any other species would have rotated the head. This dog things differently, and deserves a treat for the forward, er...upside down thinking. 
Dogs can look up!
A setter made the front page!
Ok, that was adorable
the weakest spot on his head is exposed to intese scritches
So I guess dogs can look up
My uncle has a dog that would bark at only me to pet her when I get to see her every Sunday, she doesn't prefer anyone else except me and my dad.

But, dogs can't look up!
LOL. Everything is great. Just had a lot of meetings and getting organized, this past couple of weeks. Thanks for asking. I appreciate it. I posted a bunch of stuff on YouTube last night. 😊
LOL, That is cute af! Pup is adorable.
A girl once told me while facing upside down, "Is everything alright? Why did you stop?"
My cousin's Pomeranian will start licking your hands nonstop if you stop petting it. Such a diva.

That moment when you’re like, how have I never seen this before? It’s such a classic dorky-dog move. I love Reddit. 
Breton. Looks like my dogs. I have 4 Breton. One of the most intelligent dogs IMHO
Is this an English setter?
What kind of dog is that mister? 
My cat loves his rubs, and he used to sink his claws into our hands or arms and pull them so that our hands end up on his head. He's learned that we're less likely to pull our hands back in shocked pain if he only digs his claws in just a very little, tiny bit...
