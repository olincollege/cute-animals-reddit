Donate towels etc to the shelters for warmth and easy cleanup. It's that time if year at the shelters. If this post leaves somehow, maybe spread the word :) Sweetest pup got warm, I hope.
Thought it was just a fluffy bed but then the bed moved and then I moved (emotionally)
I love white labs.  Like giant marshmallows for children. I miss max :( I still remember when I was 11 when my parents came home with him.  He made it all the way past my college graduation.  14 years. Great dog.
When my Chocolate Lab and German Shepard were puppies they used to sleep like this all the time! They actually still nap together and it melts my heart every time. Here are my napping doggos (https://imgur.com/gallery/TkvkSkD)
There's my quota of happiness for the week.
Adopting 2 dogs when i grow up is on the top of my priority list rn 😭😭
My pup gives me a cuddle like this most nights. I sleep so much better with him at my side.
I only wish my dogs liked each other this much. They keep a close but respectable distance lol.
Ferrets be like this first day they meet. (if they're neutered). 

Was worried about integrating my new one with my first one (about 6 months apart) and the first night they cuddled together 

This is them now.

This is *advanced* cuteness.
My heart can and would like some more of this please, thank you.
In the words of my 4 yo daughter after I showed her this video “that’s a bit cute”
“I’ll cuddle with you, friend, and keep you company here”
The lab is like "Alright fine get in here"
This is Kona and Nala! They have an instagram page, and they're all grown up now :)
I have yet to meet a Lab with a mean bone it their body.
i wish my dogs did this instead of pretending like the other doesn’t exist

The same energy of the times I went and joined my moms nap and we slept together.
Aww dogs are awesome
I remember when my dog first curled up next to me like that, I was having an eh day and felt out of it and the little guy came right up to me and brightened my day
This has helped my depression thanks king
I couldn’t even see the other pupper at first
I love how puppies are so tolerant of each other stepping on them and hitting them in the face. "He's alright, he's still learning how to walk."
You guys got room for one more in there?? ...I am that one more.
That’s so cute x
I'm the white dog, minding my business and my big sister is the black dog
One big need for shelters: someone to man the washing machines.  Great way to volunteer and be around howling hounds for a few hours.
god. dogs are way nicer than people aren't they.
Omg 😭😭😭😭
This means the german shepherd puppy wants the lab puppy to feed it breakfast, according to my dog.
Heart failure!

GSDs are clingy cuddle bugs.
Is that also called spooning?
Took me a while to realise there was another dog
This is Kona and Nala from IG - they are adults now!
My heart exploded
Omg this is adorable. My dogs fight if one just enters the room
Hopefully they never fight

I didn’t even notice the other dog in there until it poked its head up
German Shepherds are innate healers and caretakers. They “read” the moods of the ones in their packs- humans & animals.
This is absolutely fucking Abroable and I just wanna let you know you made my day better.
Yes I’ll take every unowned doggo now.
*steps on face*

Shhhh shhh easy does it
Labs don't mind laying on you or you laying on them.
This is love! Awwwwwe so cute!!!
I want them but I’m not able to get them 😢
<3
I want this game so bad
Dogs feel love for one another, and humans
So sweeeeeet <3
And?  Two dogs curling up, you people need to get out more.
I thought it was gonna hump the other dog
How sweet.
Is having tons of dogs a job? If so I want it. I’ll just feed them and hug them all day.
So I’m guessing you died? Who posted this then?
That's a proper awwwww❤️❤️❤️

My dog is a Pyrador and my brother's a German Shepherd and though they're a couple years older than this they're totally best friends. They looked just like this when they were puppies (although I think that's just a pure Labrador, mine has longer hair).
This reminds meof Thor and Kim when they were little. Almost 10 years ago my uncle got two puppies Thor (black german shepherd) and Kim (a golden retriever). They were really shy at first but then got used to the family and they were really close and played a lot but a few months later the gate broke and opened by itself (the locking mechanism failed) and they got out and ran away. Thor was found on a nearby street but Kim was nowhere to be found. My aunt still calls any golden retrievers Kim just in case its their long lost puppy
Small spoon responsibility. Find your croissant spot.
He just got the best blanket possible
Fantastic!
Dogs gunna dog...

Oh my heart! I so needed this wholesome content today. 🙏🏾
My husband's German Shepard past early this year, and when he was younger he had a golden retriever that had to be put down. His golden passing was one of the darkest times in his life. He's had a rough time loosing beloved pets and seeing this I would love to show him it but it may help him feel better or could make him feel worse.
They look so sweet!

Local shelter will not accept in-kind donations because of COVID. But has a wish list on Amazon, and on-line cash donations. So check tour shelter before you go.
I would watch this 100 times

Is this a shelter? And do german shepherds and labradors not get adopted almost immediately?

Now this is a good top post to start my day off. My ex chose a man over her daughter and I've been having to stay at her place to take care of my daughter and things have been rough. THIS is what I needed to see before getting my little girl on the bus before work! I gotta stay happy to keep my daughter happy. This helps! Thank you OP!

Can I comment? Funny I can comment on some things and not others. Scary that William got covid. Feeling nervous after hearing that. William was with a friend of mine a few months back and she was hinting he wanted to see me. Apparently he was sick in April? I wonder how she is doing. She lives near Mark Zuckerberg. She sees him jogging with his security. 

I am glad I did not go. William is not a romantic interest but hope he recovers. I am feeling nervous this morning is how I am feeling. Regardless of black or white covid is scary. I had no moon if they are pushing a black moon theory.
If my oldest woke up to the younger dog in his cage, he would have BEAT his ass for sure.
