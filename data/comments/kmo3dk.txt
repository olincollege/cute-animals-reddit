Hopefully, the person being proposed to doesn’t look up and/or know which window to look up to
Ask them what the answer is on your window!
What if they’re asking for help in a foreign language?

“Uoy lliw em yrram”
AHHH THIS IS MY BUILDING! I want to find the apartment so I can put a congratulations outside.

edit: WOW. Did not expect this! To answer some questions: No, that was not my husband proposing to me again. He won’t do it no matter how many times I ask. 

Yes, the building is Cirrus in Seattle. If you can find my apartment and who I am by a Harry Potter reference username then I’ll be more impressed than scared when you show up at my door. 

I’ll look for the sign tomorrow! Though we are on different levels and I’m not sure I’d see it, maybe I’ll put one up and we can be quarantine signs friends, OP?

Oh! And I’ll send a message to the building manager asking if they might know anything and if they could get a gift to them for me if they do :)

Edit 2: The person being proposed to was using a friends apartment (as mentioned in the comments.) I do not know how to tag people so thank you to whoever found that out and congrats on the proposal and it’s success!
This is the only correct way to blind side someone with a question.
DON'T DEAD


MARRY INSIDE
You should put in your window, "!ƨnoitɒlυtɒɿϱnoƆ"
Well? What's your answer?  Leave some balloons in your window!
Did it happen yet? I mean I know it’s dark here now but if you’re downtown I’m sure it’s bright enough  to tell lol
An update, but not much of one. The lights are on, but it doesn’t look like the blinds have been raised yet.
You need to hold up a sign that says “well, will you?” in your window !
If I were you I'd literally sit there all night waiting for the curtains to be lifted lol
So... wasnt there a balloon popping laser on the front page a few days ago?
This is literally the perfect opportunity to use the “don’t dead open inside” format. The person being proposed to will open the blinds and read “will marry” “you me”.
Let's hope the shades don't open fast and knock off some letters, leaving just "Yo Ma Me"
"Let's roll up the blin-" "oh honey please no, I have such a headache today.."
R/Seattle 

Fess up. Who got engaged today?
You gotta tell us how long it took for the curtain to raise lol
This made my day.  I just wrapped up a divorce and difficult marriage/separation and have been turned off of the whole relationship/dating thing, but seeing this made me really happy.  I wish them the best.  Thank you!
This building looks familiar, is this in Toronto?
Would it be creepy if you filmed it and sent it to them?
Sneak in an change it to -
You will marry me!!
I really hope this is a before and not an after photo.
Gosh, I hope she didn't look up from the street.
QUICK go buy a congratulations banner!!!
Imagine being a reddit follower and going on reddit and finding out your bf is about to propose to you because there's a picture of your windows on the top of reddits feed.
“Will marry; you me?”
r/dontdeadopeninside
Either way, their downstairs neighbor is in for a rough night.
Will marry

you me
Dude, spoliers.
*Raises curtains*

"Honey, what does 'ILWL OUY RARYM EM' mean?"

"Damn balloons out of order...."
DONT DEAD OPEN INSIDE
That's a solid plan...kinda gives him a chance to read the room before opening the curtains.
Whoever is sorting by new, op said they are home but the blinds are still down
I’m sitting here waiting for an update, like the proposer is going to hang up balloons spelling “FUCK!” if she says no or something.

OP, I hate to ask the impossible but...we’re gonna need you to talk to your neighbors.
You need to respond.
Is this Toronto? Or are all apartments the same generic building now?
Or maybe it is just a nice way to welcome a couple to their new apartment.  Congrats You Me and William Marry!
Cixelsid is ohw em si ereht neht dna
Will Marry You Me?
Dunno, sounds shady
I am 7 hours late but how the hell has no one noticed this creepy ass [face](https://i.imgur.com/eXtAC10.jpg) in the bottom of the image or am I just crazy tired.
Woke up this morning to great disappointment that there was no update!
There is no question mark
Climb the window and score a free diamond ring
Did you creep on them and watch?
Or someone across the street is about to get oT bɘꙅoqoᴙq
would be a shame if they’d get popped with a laser pointer...


ill u rry e
Two floors down and one window over looks like a face
First I was thinking "how stupid of them putting up the letters facing the wrong way" but I guess noone would propose from the 23rd floor to their girlfriend who is down on the street.
Rear window vibes
If they open the blind on their right first, the message becomes "you me will marry".
This so cute! And I would love to see this, like it makes you feel apart of it somehow. 

God I hope she says yes!
Update: it went okay
"Hey, it's a bit dim in here. Why don't we open those shades?"

"What do you mean? It's not that dark, I'll just turn this lamp on. See?"

"Oh no."
I'm sick and need to sleep,  but I'm emotionally invested now and can't sleep till we have an answer.
Does anyone else see this “Joker” face? 
Bottom row, in the middle (right from the light green window)
Maybe the person just wants to do some couple swapping with Will and Marry.
Or those curtains are closed to hide the sad reminder o a crushing rejection :(

&#x200B;

But hopefully not!
[deleted]
Or aggressively given a condition.  You. Me.  Will Marry.
Go knock and see what she said
That’s kind of exciting!
Daily dose of wholesomeness
That M kind of turning me on
You, me, Will, marry.

Seems like dinner seating arrangements?
WILL MARRY YOU ME
Will Marry You Me
Unless both curtains are raised at the same time it’s gonna be ‘Will Marry You Me”
Hope the one been asked don't have a reedit account.
Come on random Tuesday night proposal! We’re waiting on you!
WILL MARRY

YOU ME
This is the time to eat popcorn at the window naked
OP, please put a sign up on your window: Reddit has been waiting all night! What was the answer?
The whole internet is in anticipation for this one proposal haha
only thing OP has posted in the past 12 hours is a reply in a witch subreddit. Maybe they’re trying to shield us from the pain of a “No”
If you have a powerfull laser you could create the most ankward situation
Plot twist:

The balloons have been up since the proposal, which was on Christmas! The person who was being asked said yes, everyone is super happy, and they left the balloons up for a while as a fun decoration.

/u/Princess_Daisy_Dukes simply did not notice the balloons for four days, and mistakenly assumed the proposal would be yesterday.

edit: added "which was" for readibility.
Not a bad idea for a proposal on a budget
Me, in the building across the street: oN
Am I crazy? What am I looking at here? I don’t see it
WILL, MARRY YOU ME
Will marry you me?
How do you know they're not asking you?
Will marry you me
That is absolutely adorable
Hope they don't have reddit.
Put up congrats? Balloons
Don’t dead
open inside
I wanna see the update with the cartoonish human shaped hole in the glass from when she said no so he threw himself out the window
oN yaS tsuJ
Will marry, you me.
WILL MARRY YOU ME
WILL MARRY YOU ME
Will marry you me
Why does this building look so familiar, it doesn’t happen to be in the Bay Area?
You WILL marry me.
This is where we find out the person is a redditor and s/he sees it before they arrive to the apartment.
Tomorrow you need to put up balloons in your window that say "You're making a mistake!"
Will you mappy me

Not even a question mark...

I get that balloons are expensive but come on....
Will, Marry, you, me

The ultimate foursome
Thats when you get a high powered air rifle and pop all the balloons.
Totally thought they were asking someone in the other building and wrote it out backwards
r/dontopendeadinside
Perhaps they're proposing to you & are waiting for your reply by window text.
I would Spider-Man climb up the window and have my naked body pressed against the glass for when they pull up the curtains
i thought they were proposing to someone across their apartment  😂
What if it was meant for you but the other person is stupid?
Will marry/ you me.
I see a weird gorilla shape in one of the windows in the middle towards the bottom am I the only one who sees that?
2 weeks later, you see them still floating, lower every day.
Marry me will you
Awww😭😭😭
My neighbor across the street had a giant sign on his house that said "(gf name) WILL YOU... " with the rest obscured by the tree in my yard. I was thinking wow, but later went outside and saw the rest said "MOVE IN WITH ME"

Well, she did say yes, so good for them. :)
Imagine if the person setting it up actually meant it to be seen from the outside and they're just really struggling
You need to put words "Did they say yes?" on your window. Hopefully they did...
WILL MARRY YOU ME
It’s actually for you. Congratulations! Mazel tov!

Be warned, they may not be able to understand your perspective on things moving forward.
Hopefully she doesn’t see this pic first!
Send a congratulatory gift!
Or they're asking you and they don't know how windows work
Will marry you me? What are all 4 of us gonna be doing??? Spit it out
You need to put congrats balloons in your window
As someone who is literally waiting until 2021, I hope this fianceé doesn't see this
I can’t not see the meme [https://imgur.com/gallery/8YCtBoL](cat)
Or someone outside is currently being proposed to, very poorly.
remindme!
RemindMe! 1 day
r/dontdeadopeninside
It's a message to you. They just aren't very bright and put it up backwards to you
You should put on your window, “Say Yes!”
Is this The Post downtown Seattle!? My office is across the street.
Sexy time soon! Get your telescope ready
Will Marry, you me?
They're either Star Wars fans.... or he didn't think about word placement when raising the blinds. "Marry Me, Will You" lol
It's ME!!!
[Imgur](https://imgur.com/z10phRA)
Woohoo I hope they say yes!!
Put a sign in your window and ask how it went lol
No, they were hoping you'd see it in your bathroom mirror that they secretly always watch you at.
That's adorable!
Where I’m at in Texas we don’t have apartment buildings so it’s crazy to think about the range of things you may see in Windows!
Cute. Now Pop them with lasers.
I hope they said yes
I gotta know if they said yes or not
No, I’m fairly certain that there’s two new residents in that apartment. Will Marry and You Me, hard to tell if they are in a serious relationship though.
Well, what happened?
Update update!
Must be so sad pulling an all nighter of Minecraft knowing that they are partying and are extremely happy
YOU ME WILL MARRY.

WILL MARRY YOU ME.

UOY EM LLIW YRRAM.

LLIW YARRM UOY EM.
Will marry you me
You will marry me
Will marry you me
Hey, I proposed to my fiancé in this building!
I wish the best of luck to that couple
Any updates yet?
r/dontdeadopeninside
This is very wholesome but we really gotta stop buying these balloons. They could have easily used paper or something compostable.
Everyone still trying to read it backwards even though title says it all lol
Use a laser to pop the “ry” balloons in marry.
Dick move: find one of those lasers that can pop a balloon.
Bet you guys $50 this building is in Seattle or Bellevue, WA. Tons and tons of these ghetto ass boxcar apartments for $2000-5000/month.

Gosh I hope the answer is yes!
 “Can I expect this level of tacky for the next 40 years?”
She said no
Get a high power laser and pop them :D
"Will marry you me"
It’s also a bit of r/dontdeadopeninside
It took me way longer than I care to admit for me to get it (see it).
Will Marry You Me
Hopefully their potential fiancee isn't on reddit.
Actually this was for me, I’m dyslectic.
Who's will?
I've seen too many memes and was zooming in on the windows looking for someone on their knees.  Eventually saw the balloons.
You need to make a message on your window that says 

WHAT DID SHE REPLY?
"Babe, are you there? Why is it so dark in here?"

...

"I'm gonna open the blinds, okay?"

...

*gasp*
Hope we get an update!
get a powerful laser and pop them
Plot twist, the proposal was aimed at you but the proposer isn't very clever and didn't realise the message needs to be reversed.
CX?
Sneak over there and change it so it says "BUTT STUFF?"
I would walk outside right by this window but not notice it, so a proposal like that would have been a good surprise for me. Hope this prospective partner is unobservant like me or does not look up!
Hope he or she doesn't see it first on this sub. Doh!
But did they say yes?
Did she say yes?
Get a laser pointer and pop them
What If the person is a member of the sub and you just blew up the surprise!?
Will Marry You Me
The automatic blind reveal
Run Cross and ring the door bell.. (provided you work out which unit, or just ring all of them) and yell "congrats on getting married!"
Put a yes sign in your window.
Put a big sign in your window asking if they said yes. We gotta know!
will, marry, you, me

&#x200B;

the cursed foursome
You will me marry?
Best of wishes for them!
When those shades go up, I bet they'll drag the balloons with them.
Plot twist: She's a redditor and recognizes the building.
Will Marry You - Me
I hope she doesn’t walk/drive home this way...
Will marry, You me?
Don’t Dead Open Inside
Or they are proposing to someone in your building and are not very bright.
Will Marry You Me
Hopefully they attached those balloons in a manner that the blinds won’t remove some of the letters
UOY LLIW

What an odd way to propose.
Break the glass
Watch like 5 dudes try to use this for themselves.
More like (will marry you me)
Probably gonna catch a case
I think about you when I'm countin' sheep

I think about you, then I can't sleep

I think that ocean is just so deep

That's my window on the world
Film it in case it’s one of those funny ones where the girl runs away.
Will marry you me
I hope he brought her to the apartment blindfolded
"Don't dead open inside" vibes.  Really different, but it's the first thing that came to mind.
Will Marry You Me?!
What a fun thing to witness!!
Imagine someone in your building seeing that - the right way around - in their mirror and flipping out...
She’s a redditor....
I'm hoping for a follow up post of the guy taking down the balloons while crying.
will marry you me?
Or they suffer from dyslexia and the intended target is....
That’s my building
Will Marry You Me.
"Will marry you me"  ??
WILL MARRY - YOU ME
It could be for you, but he or she is too dense to realize the letters need to be flipped over, and placed in the other direction.
Will marry you me!!!!???
Marry me, you will.
The balloons can be rearranged to spell, "You willy rammer."

Hopefully the person they're proposing to doesn't go on reddit (at least before the proposal)
Anyone else annoyed by the poor use of space they used for the letters?

dam can you imagine if the proposer comes to the apartment with some more last minute stuff to add to the occasion only to find the proposee with another dude and just as he strolls in and his life has turned completely upside down the blinds magically just happen to go up revealing the balloons..
