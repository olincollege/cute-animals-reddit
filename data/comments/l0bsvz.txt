Snoop Dog's dog.
Gonna need the name, breed, location and is there easy access to the garden he plays in....for research purposes.
He definitely ate the trash.

That's a guilty dog.
I'm imagining the dog in a gay dudes voice saying "Goood moornieieieing"
This is what I imagine my boyfriend looks like when he's waiting for me to wake up. What a cute pup! 🥰
The goodest boy 🥲
I'd give my soul to this good boi right here 😭
u/ediblepoop then I guess you'll find this cute also? I our journey through miscellaneous subreddits ends here, I'm afraid. It is 3 am and I need sleep lol

So cute! My dog makes this face when he's done something wrong, then I have to search the house to see what it is. If he never made the face I wouldn't know lol.
You will be sorry for not petting me properly...

I love how Shibas look like actual anime characters.
His face is so cute!!!!
So wholesome
One of the best things when you have a dog is waking up when you hear the dog start walking around, but then a few minutes later you feel your bed start to vibrate and you know the dog is just staring at you with their tail vigorously wagging which causes the entire bed to vibrate.
good morning mr shibi
happy shibe
I just want to boop that snoot!
u/savethevideo

Hands are made for: PET DA DOGGO
Oh henlo there! Will boop your nose 🥺👉👈
Gooood morning, I just ate your wallet with your credit cards and shat behind the sofa. So happy you're awake hooman, I was about to start getting destructive☺️💕
[deleted]
Resist me hooman
I want one
I wish I woke up to someone so excited to see me :(
My brother has 2 shibas and I have never seen their tails wag 

One is also the biggest asshole you will ever meet
I’ve heard this kind to squinting is the dog anticipating being hit. I hope that’s not true! Super cute doggo.. hope he’s got a nice human.
cant even stop thinking about it
This dog is clearly afraid. He behaving like he don't know if he get a pat or a slap. The owner is probably inconsistent in that regard.
The fuck is wrong with the person filming this? First they holds their hand like they're about to slap the dog, then fucking tinklewinkle fingers close to the dog, barely even touching it.

When they put out their hand at first the dog shrugs back a bit and the whole face is like it expects a slap or push. The whole thing feels very off.
He looks high af
Aren’t those like all the signs of stressed anxious dog? Squinted eyes, ears down, lip licking? Like dog is obeying while expecting to be hurt.
