The cat did 23 sit-ups in 16 seconds.

If it continues with this pace, it is better than the average dude doing the military physical tests.

Is that secretly a human in body of a cat?
Does anyone else wish you could just ask the cat what the heck he is trying to do? Lol.
He's doing his best.
Chad in the streets, puss in the sheets.
Why do I hear the rocky training montage soundtrack?
I'm in shape. Round is a shape.
Please watch out for its leg days, bet hes gonna press d car up.
I loved this video.  Gave me a big chuckle.  We are always joking with my kitty named Mouse about her “winter tummy/body”. She won’t go outside in the winter and the first warm days she heads out to the front deck.  We caught her doing something similar under the front porch table.  I called my hubby out to the porch so he could see Mouse trying to get her summer bikini body back.  Lol.  Side note, she’s been fixed for 10 years and started developing a bigger tummy shortly after fixing her but every summer she thins out and gets her bikini body back.  Lol.
Yeah get ripped boi
This cat is that bulldozer trying to push the Ever Given
im in the comments for someone to explain to me what terrible mental illness this cat is suffering from instead of it being cute
Is this where really ripped cats come from? But why
Guys this is NOT funny, when a cat does this they are actually DISTRESSED because of body image issues and the unrealistic media standards for cats
That's a cat with ambition
"You like wrapping me up like a burrito? I'll wrap YOU up like a burrito next time! 1...2...3...4..."


"I'll knock that cast iron pot off the shelf! That'll show you!1...2...3...4..."
Cute but better get the cat stop hanging out there or it's not gonna end well.

why is a cat more motivated to exercise than i ever will?
Core strength is important.
The chad cat.
How do you anticipate such scenes and start filming?
Cats have Insane core strength. It's a big part of the reason why some of them can stand on their back legs like little people and why they can do all those weird spazzy flips when they're playing
my man getting those abs done
That cat did more situps in a few seconds than me in a year.

I'm gonna go cry now
awww but there's no such thing as summer body 😌

I thought that poor thing is stuck until I found out its actually licking itself.
It’s working and sucking it’s dick what an achievement
First I thought it had its left leg stuck under the car, then the cat that happens to live in our house and eat our food but doesn't act like it actually lives here started doing something similar nearby: licking her belly fur.
there should be a subreddit about posting abnormally buff animals instead of abnormally fat ones.

Holy shit that cat is better than me!
Please give this cat a proper exercise space. I just hate the idea of this guy doing his routine early morning when you're about to leave for work. You start your car, kick it in reverse, and the next thing you know that back tire is 2 feet off the ground and you're at the mercy of a pissed off cat hulk.
The only thing that could possibly drive a creature as lazy as a cat to this is revenge. Sleep with one eye open, OP

I can learn workout from the cat. Do you have her number?
In David Attenborough's voice:  Here we have a prime example of feline illusion's of grandeur, he's obsessed with knocking things off tables that he believes he can knock the car off if he tries hard enough.  He's so single minded he doesn't even realize that the car is not on a table, he just sees the car and thinks "I can knock that".  Truly remarkable.
