This remind me of reading the short story["Bears Discover Fire"](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/bears-discover-fire/), by Terry Bisson, many years ago. 

You should definitely read it. In short, a dad, his brother and his son are driving in the south, they get a flat tire, and the son has to hold a flashlight while the dad change tires. The light goes out, after struggling with the light, it comes back. But they notice the light it not coming from the flashlight, turning around they see two bears standing behind them on two legs, holding torches while watching them curiously. They drive off in complete silence, until the dad remark "Looks like bears have discovered fire,‚Äù 

Then soon, people start seeing beers doing camping trips along the interstate, just chilling, Turns out beers decided they don't need to hibernate anymore now that they have fire. The beers turn out to be total bros too, and they even end up sharing their campfires with passing humans.
Cute but remember the saying: A fed bear is a dead bear.

Bears that get used to human interaction and reliance on human food sources often end up being euthanized.

Momma Bear: "Go ahead, go on and ask the gentleman why you knocked."

Cub: "Would you like to talk about our Lord and Savior Satan?"

Me: "The Mormons were too conservative and the Catholics didn't act what they believed in....but this is just right!"

It's Paddington.
Cute wee fella, with big Mama bear keeping a close eye.

Having moved to an area with loads of bears, I became fascinated by them. 

Never felt so small, hiking in the mountains when a black bear with cubs cuts across the path a bit ahead and has a good old stare at us. Between the majestic towering mountains and my first time seeing a big daft bear giving me the beady eye, you realise for all humans have acheived, in the grand scheme we are fuck all if mother nature wants to send a bit of fluffy chaos your way. 
As calm and cuddly as that bear looked, there's always that part of your brain going "fuck me, Balu could rip me from arsehole to earhole and not break a sweat ". I'll not forget it.

I've since learned a lot more about bears and had a few more encounters and only wish I was back living in the mountains.
"....... Trick or treat"
They‚Äôre gonna take your pic-in-ic baskets
You were one very thin pane of glass away from being fucked up by that momma bear.

You can see from the posturing of the mother bear that she's really concerned, it's almost human like lol, she's like "get down from there you stupid ass kid not all humans are nice".
He looks like hes about you ask you what games you have on your phone in a snot filled voice
All I see is a small child in a bear suit.

Omg my heart just melted!!
Nice
