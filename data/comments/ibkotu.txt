I'm waiting for the bear in the back to say " it's ok sweetheart, remember say trick or treat"

This remind me of reading the short story["Bears Discover Fire"](https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/bears-discover-fire/), by Terry Bisson, many years ago. 

You should definitely read it. In short, a dad, his brother and his son are driving in the south, they get a flat tire, and the son has to hold a flashlight while the dad change tires. The light goes out, after struggling with the light, it comes back. But they notice the light it not coming from the flashlight, turning around they see two bears standing behind them on two legs, holding torches while watching them curiously. They drive off in complete silence, until the dad remark "Looks like bears have discovered fire,” 

Then soon, people start seeing beers doing camping trips along the interstate, just chilling, Turns out beers decided they don't need to hibernate anymore now that they have fire. The beers turn out to be total bros too, and they even end up sharing their campfires with passing humans.
Cute but remember the saying: A fed bear is a dead bear.

Bears that get used to human interaction and reliance on human food sources often end up being euthanized.
Bear.

Looks like me when a go back up to the bar to get another beer lol
It's Paddington.
Cute wee fella, with big Mama bear keeping a close eye.

Having moved to an area with loads of bears, I became fascinated by them. 

Never felt so small, hiking in the mountains when a black bear with cubs cuts across the path a bit ahead and has a good old stare at us. Between the majestic towering mountains and my first time seeing a big daft bear giving me the beady eye, you realise for all humans have acheived, in the grand scheme we are fuck all if mother nature wants to send a bit of fluffy chaos your way. 
As calm and cuddly as that bear looked, there's always that part of your brain going "fuck me, Balu could rip me from arsehole to earhole and not break a sweat ". I'll not forget it.

I've since learned a lot more about bears and had a few more encounters and only wish I was back living in the mountains.
"....... Trick or treat"
They’re gonna take your pic-in-ic baskets
You were one very thin pane of glass away from being fucked up by that momma bear.

We don’t deserve bears hide them keep them safe!

I would crack the door just slightly enough to hand him a banana, for being a good little bear.

Once he looks at you and notices you're there he backs up, lol.

But yeah these bears shouldnt be getting used to humans like this. 

Are you living in Alaska or something?

Can’t believe animals that cute and sweet could rip your guts out and eat you alive.
Give that bear a raincoat
and drunk, apparently

You can see from the posturing of the mother bear that she's really concerned, it's almost human like lol, she's like "get down from there you stupid ass kid not all humans are nice".
He looks like hes about you ask you what games you have on your phone in a snot filled voice
All I see is a small child in a bear suit.
I needed this video to be much longer. So cute!
As much as it sucks having to worry about them fucking with your shit, they are incredibly cute. We woke up one night to a couple of cubs playing on our deck and it was pretty fuckin adorable

I’m so glad I don’t live anywhere near wandering wildlife.  I’d be bear food in an instant and I’d have no regrets except not having time to season myself beforehand for these cuties
Oh my God, he looks like a little trick-or-treater! 😭
Seriously tough, that's a freaking bear. Would not want so close to me house cuz that's so much closer to me being bear breakfast for two
Mom said I could use the Xbox next.
Straight outta brave
I love baby bears so much. They're like little toddlers but with fur.

Why does this person believe the sheet of glass will protect them from a bear that's in the vulnerable presence of its baby. I'd be SO scared omg

Looks like most of my friends stumbling up to my door on a Saturday night with their Uber driver looking over lovingly while rating them a 1.
Am I the only one finding this terrifying? The mama bear was right there, waiting and ready for anything. One sudden move and if the baby bear got freaked out you're doomed!
Omg my heart just melted!!
Nice
I just don’t have an answer in these times. Really I don’t know if they make a difference. Maybe they don’t no know much about this pandemic, I have no other solution to wear those fucking masks... sooo I wear them

Could you imagine if they stayed that size forever and they didn’t have such sharp claws. I think humans would keep them as pets and cuddle them all the time. Like I’d literally quit my job if I could cuddle little bears all day long

If he were a turkey, he’d be attacking his reflection rather than just being curious about it.

Aw even walks like a toddler!
Aren’t you gonna answer the door?
Son, remember what I told you. 
If you walk on 2 legs they might just think you’re a human kid and adopt you, we’ve got no honey to raise you.
