When I was growing up our black lab would howl with the sirens. He'd tip his head back as far as it'd go and rock side to side on his front paws until the sirens were gone.

Surely all of that traffic is stacked up with people stopping to listen to the awoo
This broken siren should replace all the sirens in the world 
What breed is it ? Looks cute as heck !
Best thing I've seen this morning! Made my day.

Should be a new siren for police. You think anyone is gonna runaway from such a good boy?

No it's just fine
The first night I had my rescue pup, he started howling like the along with some passing sirens at like 2am and gave me a heart attack. I never had a dog before and he had also not made any noise before then so it was a total surprise. I think it‚Äôs adorable now though.

I want the sirens to be this from now on.
That weird moment when the dogs in the hood don't know how to howl but you answer them anyway! Cool dog! 
I think we should put our taxes towards training dogs to replace sirens
Be still my beating heart!
Did anyone else think of Harry and the Hendersons when they watched this?
All sirens should be replaced with these good boys

This is the kind of siren I would not give way for. I'd run towards it instead and cuddle its face. 
Samoyeds are SO cute! Are they always this vocal? 
yo my dog does this aswell
Sirens broken but the woofer is still working Chief.
Chief: Great.

Lol, I love how (s)he howls then glances at the camera, stops for a second, and continues like 'whatever'!

Very sweet and it added to the positive vibe of today (lazy Sunday, weather is dope, just finished a round of Banished and had a pizza). Life is good.

I do this with my pups about once a week. We get into a howling session and I can get them going quite easily.

Though I get odd looks from people when I begin howling randomly at friends houses to get there doggos to join in.

I start off low and gain pitch and volume. They always join in!
Poor doggo 
I like this one more.
*Rur rur rur rur rur*
This really upset my dogs. They were making and came up to me with the concerned tail wag. I'm serious, they can tell something is wrong. They are looking for comfort.

So cute

I need to make this a ringtone.
Breed?
Can someone explain why dogs actually do this? Like, why do they mimic the siren?
Haha I used to work out of an ambulance that sounded more like the dog than the siren in the background. It was such a heap! 20 years old, shorter than anything else I‚Äôve seen in the back, an exhaust leak that was louder than the siren and that V10 drank fuel at an astonishing rate! 
Hes doing backup motor revving noises.
I used to play siren sounds from YouTube all the time to get my dog to do that. I loved him.
Awwwww. It think it's a police poochie. 
Sounds like it‚Äôs working just fine to me!

Oh man. I've watched this 5 times and I laugh every time. Thank you
Imagining two elderly owners of the vehicle staring blankly into the traffic while this dog does this out the window for a half hour straight. 
Please someone tell me what breed this dog is.

Can you imagine if he was the local firehouse dog. 
Such siren! 
But it‚Äôs getting the job done!
Awwww
OWOOOOUWOOOOWUUUUU (whats this?)
There is something naturally wired in dogs to react to sirens. 

I don‚Äôt know what it is, but the only time I‚Äôve ever heard my dog howl is when he hears a siren. We could be doing his favorite thing in the world and when he hears a siren, he stops where he is and starts howling.

I‚Äôve tried to fake howl myself to get him to do it and he never does it unless he hears a siren. 
My girl does this when she ‚Äúhowls‚Äù too. It sounds like she‚Äôs chewing her howl. 
Personally if police cars were equipped with dog sirens I think that'd be much more effective.
Oh my gosh that‚Äôs so cute!
Awwww. Hes soooo cute!!!!
That‚Äôs the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day. 
This video is blessed. 
HE BARK
somtimes the player plays more than one set of audio for some reason and it got really funny there for a min. 
Broken?? I think I‚Äôd rather have this fluffy siren!

Hahaha this is the BEST! I don't care who says otherwise, I love it when my doggo howls with the sirens üòÇ
Can't stop watching this 
Isn't it funny how each one of them has their own distinctive howl? Yours has his own special rhythm. I was surprised at how my little puppy sounded so deep throated and fierce. I guess he'll grow into that.
I showed it to my doggo and he did the whole inclined head thing :3
Just laughed my lungs out üòÇ
They are in hot pupsuit
Omg my neighbors dog howls when there are sirens which then sets another dog off nearby and makes my dog run to the door and want to go outside to see what all the fuss is about and maybe bark to.
This siren needs to go in for repair.üòÜ

I love my malamute more and more every day...

But the day she learned that emergency sirens were NOT distant friends singing to her, a small part of me died in sadness.  Silly smart old puppy.  I miss those excited howls.
I used to have an /r/akita when I was little that would bark and howl every time police, fire and ambulance sirens start going off. 
This is SO CUTE! üòÅ
This is the best clip i saw today <3
He/she is beautiful. What kind of dog is it please? I've only ever seen huskies do this. (I've never seen a all white Husky) Although it is entirely possible I imagine. Is it a Malimute?
