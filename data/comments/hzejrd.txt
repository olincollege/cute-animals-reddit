If I remember correctly there has never been a recorded incident of a cheetah attacking or killing a human. They are pretty skittish of humans, but because of their strength, size and reputation as fast predators, they get lumped in with larger aggressive cats like lions and tigers.
I once met Jeff Corwin, and he reminisced about taking care of a baby elephant at an elephant sanctuary, petting and comforting it when it had bad dreams in the middle of the night. The sanctuary had found that even with the best of care and no existing medical problems, baby elephants would die if locked in a barn by themselves overnight. They need to be constantly touched. You can see this in videos where the mom and "aunt" elephants constantly stroke the babies with their trunks. So volunteers at the sanctuary get to spend the night in the barn with the baby elephants.

The same principle is behind promoting skin-to-skin contact with newborn human babies, especially the preemies.
The fact that cheetahs are naturally anxious creatures makes them much cuter and more relatable
The 2 Cheetahs who got up after the first one were disappointed they didn't get a cuddle.
And shortly after they were.....fast asleep.
Did he raise them or something? How are they so friendly with him
Had to check, pretty sure I've seen the whole video. This is Dolph C. Volker, here's the full video: https://youtu.be/i3waAOcJkps
How do I go about applying for this job?
A cuddle puddle !!
This is how I sleep with my dog almost every night. The cuddles are the best. 

Cheetah cuddles would be terrifying. Awesome, but terrifying. I envy this man getting to experience what most of us never will.
Genuine question!  
How do I get myself from stop fearing animals? 

I wasn't raised among any kind of animals and for some reason I am very startled by cats and dogs. How do I over come that? 

I want to adopt a pup some time in the future, I love looking at them and I love the responsibility of raising a pet friend. BUT, I am 26 years old and can be quite afraid of animals. 

Is it normal and is there a work around it? I don't want to sleep with a Cheetah obviously, but I want a dog or a cat friend to cuddle with someday.
[His cats really love him, and so does his dog.](https://i.imgur.com/unDcm21.gifv)
God I wish that were me
Zoo employee: Dave! Why are you here early?

Dave:  Oh. I slept with the cheetahs.
Wish my cats were like this. They will, no matter how tidy I try to be, find an old receipt or a piece of crinkly plastic and persistently chew on it until I have to get up and chase them in the middle of the night to through it away. An hour later and they have have another one. I‚Äôm beginning to think they go shopping themselves and save up their own receipts just for this purpose.
It's my turn to be little spoon.
This is the only time it's OK to be cheetahed on
I want his Job!
It's incredible they all fit in that little space along with the giant BALLS of this dude.
How do you avoid early morning bison breath?

Here is the og video https://youtu.be/i3waAOcJkps
Awww poor baby‚Äôs
My mother's lawyer who was a big entertainment lawyer in the 1940's had a cheetah that went everywhere with him, including the office. The only place the cheetah didn't go was to court because it would have been too scary for the cat. My mother, who was very scared of even plain house cats, was terrified when she had to go see him but she told me the cat just laid down in his bed in the corner and didn't even acknowledge her. Her lawyer told her the cheetah was just an overgrown house cat, and now I can see why.
My depression is gone. My skin is clear. The sun is shinning. The birds are singing. Poverty is eradicated. Everything is right in the world because of these cute cheetahs.
I want a caretaker now
It‚Äôs all fun cuddling with cheetahs until one of them gets gassy
Cheeto
This is so sweetüíî
That doesn't seem nervous. Seems like they were chilly.
[deleted]
He must have a really good relationship with those cheetahs to avoid becoming a midnight snack.
Who needs a partner when you have cheetahs to cuddle
I hope he doesn't play card games with them.
well, he‚Äôs not cold
Seems like a pretty awesome job, tbh.
I love this!
Snuggles time!
This is the most amazing thing I've seen on reddit so far!
So cute but cats are really warm though. Dude must have been roasting.
I would love to snuggle a cheetah!
That one cheetah who directly went on to snuggle is so relatable.
Cheetas are basically large house cats
I want this job. Haha
I needed this today
My heart can't take so much on one day. This is just adorable
well, that‚Äôs my new job decided!
r/fuckingnextlevel
So cute T^T
Dammit where do I get myself a pile of cheetahs?
Cheetah - cat hardware running on dog software.
Somehow I now want this job as a cheetah companion üòç
Used to sleep out with cheetahs and the bastions pissed on my sleeping bag 9 nights out of 10
do you think?
**BEST. JOB. EVER.**
Could you imagine just waking up to 3 cheetahs getting nervous right next to you?

WTF?
I would comfort them EVERY night...  make sure no bad kitty baby dreams...
Just like baby's.
They all want to be the little spoon ü•∫
Why are cheetahs so nervous
Awwww. I want one of the cheetahs
This guy was just out sleeping with cheetahs to see what it was like. His videos are up on YouTube oh, there was nothing about comforting them during the night.
So lucky... :(
Brb crying, they're such big ol' babies. Sweet.
They are just making sure there breakfast won‚Äôt get away.
What the heck kinda cuteness is this?!ü•∞‚ù§
I am clearly in the wrong profession.
What is a family but a man and his 3 anxious cheetahs
This is so beautiful ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏èI‚Äôm jealous
Some people have the best jobs.
this man just opened his arms and the cheetah just LAID DOWN like it knew it would get cuddled, so pure we love to see it. animals are so damn smart
I too would like to lay with a pile of dog-sized cats
One of my life goals is to somehow be part of a cheetah cuddle puddle
Cheetahs are the feline equivalent of a dog?
Is that person wearing chain mail?
Soooo cute
Could you imagine a pack of CHEETAHS feeling safe with you? Amazing.
How does one acquire this power? I mean job.
Just a guy and his scaredy-cats
I want this in my life
Talk about a dream job.
This video goes under many titles. It could even be 'Hobo caught sleeping in zoo with wild cheetahs'

the truth is probably somewhere in the middle
I love the butt scoot he does in the end to get cozy and close with his human
Like sleeping with 4 toddlers
AWWEE!!!!
CUDDLE BUDDIES!!!
that face when no cheetah for cuddles
This warms my heart :)
r/madlads
That room is full of farts.
Spooning with a cheetah, that's new to me.
I'm convinced that cheetahs are just big cats
I had a dog that was super restless during the night like that. That dude is waking up double tired!
Meanwhile my cat doesn‚Äôt trust me to handle anything at all. I‚Äôm no comfort to him in any case.
So how much to sleep with a cheetah?
Super jealous! I cant even get my damn cat to look at me, let alone crawl under the covers with me.
Can I be a cheetah snuggler too? Will work for free
That is one lucky dude. I would pay good money to nap with a cheetah, let alone three.
crosspost to /r/leopardsdidnoteatmyface
My cat does this. I'll wake up in the middle of the night to her nussling my hand. I let her under the blanket and give her scritches until we go back to sleep.
‚ô•
I wasn‚Äôt aware that such things took place in this world üò≥
What I see here are just large house cats haha my cat did the same thing to snuggle at night
My dog is in the process of going blind and he gets anxious in the night and snuggles in with me just like that first one. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Latte and a Schnoodle, life is good
Anyone who has ever had a greyhound knows the struggle of hearing them get up at 3 A.M. and march around like this.
I've seen the full YouTube video a good while ago and it was definitly not about 'comforting' the cheetahs.
I love that right at the end the first ones head bolts up again.
I want this job. How do I get it?? Lol. It‚Äôs perfect. Sleeping and cuddling with big cats! What more could someone want?!
How they trust their human companion. It's so good to watch
My dog and I would be in heaven.  We both love snuggles
Awww what big babies! How cute!
Cheetahs are so delicate emotionally
How dare he not have more arms!!!
A cuddle puddle with cheetahs!  I want this job.
This is my dream job. Period.
I'd be the only thing nervous in there
Dogs. Every species best friend.
They're more cuddly than my cat!
That little foot near the end... it's too much
At the end of the day, they are puppies in the body of a big cat.
Reminds me of that bear guy and his wife
Nothing like a fuzz pigpile.  I'm typing this with a cat sleeping on my chest.
Omg i wish i could cuddle with them aswell
I want one.
cheeto
Is this  in jungle or zoo ?
:O
The way it lifted its foot on its sibling like that in the end. So cute!
Whatever job that is, that‚Äôs what I want to be when I grow up.
I got chu pal

*With ma foot*
Why do they get nervous?
What a great job. I bet he is fulfilled every single day.
is the caretaker wearing chainmail?
The amount of money I would pay to have a Cheetah cuddle with me is ASTRONOMICAL

How do I get this job?
I wish to become a cheetah comforter. Please.
Where do you apply and do I have to relocate? I only ask because I need to know what to pack.
Its not too late for a career change..
They were anxious because they knew it was only a matter of time before they ate him
Awwww
What ? Why the heck would cheetas be scared of the night ... Here's the original vid https://youtu.be/i3waAOcJkps
They‚Äôre just big cats with a dogs nature lol
Its very difficult for that man to walk.
Big or small, cats are cats.
Imagine waking up after a one night stand to 3 cheetahs laying next to you
A pile of cheetahs
"I love you, Cheetahs"

"We love you too, food."

I really really love how big cats are literally...big...cats and you see that in the way they act and it‚Äôs so cute
Dolph! He is amazing and the relationship he has with these animals is incredible.
He's an awesome guy. I watched a few of his videos few months ago. 

Btw he wasn't "comforting" them and they weren't nervous. He was trying to see if they would prefer to sleep on the cold concrete or on the warm blanket with him
This is dean schneider i assume.
It's established,  I'm a cheetah
I just died
..come on this is SO SWEET
Dude is lying on the floor with not much more than a few blankets. Doing the same would wreck my back & neck, but omg, I'd be there in a heartbeat if given the opportunity to cuddle cheetahs.
My high school counselor failed to tell me that being a Professional Cuddler is a career option.
Now you can never move or shift that arm again or you risk waking the kitty! Every cat owner knows haha
Awww the one kicks it‚Äôs leg out and plops it on the other one. I love it when my cat does that, too.
Cuddle a cheetah added to the bucket list
Ummm, how do I sign up for this sleeping arrangement?
Read this elsewhere so don‚Äôt give me upvotes. It‚Äôs a cat hardware and dog software.

It's so sad how anxious they can be.
must be thunder or something.  My cat is the exact same way in a storm, circles and falls into me exactly like this
I wanna do that
Man, i bet that dude has issues walking with those massive balls he has.
Where do I apply for this job?
is it at all likely that the genetic bottlenecking that affects cheetahs has amplified their sensory perception to such an extent that now they're all nervous wrecks?

it's already well established that the species has come back from the edge of extinction at least once (and are doing it again now, hopefully). the [Journal of Heredity has a 2017 article that says: Cheetahs \[display\] 90‚Äì99% less overall diversity than other cats and most other mammals based upon early surveys of nuclear allozymes](https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/108/6/671/3836924). it makes me wonder if this kind of 'anxiety disorder' (anthropomorphic, i know) has been inherited by all of them
I want this

I have to do the same with my kitty too.
Love this guys YouTube channel.
Must be pretty cold for a three cheetah night.

Sad to see exotic animals as pets. It really isn't cute to see a cheetah curled up with a man. Cheetahs should be in the wild, living their lives as cheetahs.

Question. Do their body temp go up during sleeping?
No one ever will fuck with this person.
I need more context.
That's a three cheetah night right there.
that's so cute I didn't know they're anxious creatures.

Serious question. Why would they get nervous Aren't they wild animals? Also I thought cheetahs hunted at night.
Guy's sleeping with cheetahs and *they're* the ones who get nervous

What‚Äôs it feel like to wake up to a dead arm sleeping with a cheetah?

Them: (As a threat) You sir will be sleeping with the Cheetahs!!
Me: ok cool
A cheetah ate my face
It looks scary but the cutie knows what's up
This is completely out of context, the original video is him showing AND explaining how they would rather share body warmth then sleep on cold concrete
That's so adorable
Hi , where the fuck do I sign up to do this?
I have no idea what I'm talking about and this might be a dumb question but are animals like Cheetahs capable of forming a bond and being loyal to their caretaker or human owner?

If so, are they territorial of others? How intelligent are they? can they distinguish of their caretaker is being threatened by another human and will they protect them?

This is fascinating, I had no idea Cheetahs were so chill towards humans.
You know how when you‚Äôre playing with a car they can flip out and kick for no reason? You could be best friends with a cheetah but what happens when they do that?
This is epic! I want to snuggle with cheetahs, where do I sign up?!
I want this job.
You know they have dogs for that.

That is literally how me and my cat sleep.
Cheetahs are oversized kittens. They can't even growl, they just meow most of the times.

Fucking adorable
I can feel his arm getting numb, lol.
Fun fact about cheetahs! They are considered the only big cat that can be tamed. They‚Äôre extremely popular ‚Äúpets‚Äù among royalty (Russian, Indian, Italian, and Persian, I believe.) because of that along with losing their habitats, slow reproduction and other environmental factors their numbers are dwindling in the wild. There are only about 7,100 wild cheetahs.

Edit: I guess it‚Äôs not really a fun fact after the the tamed part...
They were just searching for their midnight snack
I NEED the audio
I want a cheetah now
What does he do when they get hungry during the night?
OP definitely added the "comforting nervous" part himself.

Everybody gets scared sometimes very rarely does a person have somebody like this to look after them and make things all better.

I wish that weren't true
Cheetoh
They really are just big ol housecats
Aw man... My chest is all tight from wanting this so bad!!! I bet it started purring too. Sigh.

What makes cheetahs so nervous? Is it because of their speed makes them hyper vigilant?
Can you imagine being in a cheetah cuddle puddle
Aww big babies. I'm so jealous of that cuddle puddle.
That is so wholesome
This should of been ‚Äúman wakes outside to find some have joint him‚Äù just because as fist I thought he was freaking out
Terrifying and completely beautiful.
Cheetah king.
Cheetahs really are cats running dog software.
Whats the backstory behind this im generaly curious how did the guy end up in that situtaion
From what I remember, they just situate a lot during the night. They have "ticks" that come from minor disabilities, but I don't think they're nervous. They are very cuddly, though.
Imagine sleeping but you‚Äôre cuddling 4 cheetahs
I just love animals
I have the original video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3waAOcJkps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3waAOcJkps)

DWAH
First r/aww post that got multiple ‚Äúawwws‚Äù from me
This is a very sweet video,  but i feel like no matter the bond you have they are still wild animals. I'm 100% sure he loves those cheetas and im pretty sure they care about him on some level as well...(love or maybe as a pack leader). I just hate that videos like this go around and it makes people think "oh cheetas are friendly I want one" thsn we end up with people with zero knowledge of these animals getting hurt and the animal being blamed for it. I just want people to realize that they are gorgeous creatures but they are NOT pets!!! I don't know this man's story but I hope he is careful enough to remember that they are still wild and since they are cats can just go crazy fir no reason at all.
*heart explodes*
Now I want a cheetah

That is not what this video is about at all. Clever of you to trim the video so his explanation is not included.

If you‚Äôre going to post someone else‚Äôs content at least keep it original and don‚Äôt distort the message so that you can suck additional karma from users.
What...what if you have to get up and pee in the middle of the night with 3-4 anxious cheetahs piled on top of you?
Cheetahs are one of the largest purring felines. Imaging how loud that must be.
They are not nervous.  They are alpha killers.  Humans are weak.
The first still picture, before playing the video sure looks like a horror movie
I wanna be a professional cheetah cuddler.
Really amazing
If I could have some cheetah companions I would be SO happy
And how does one apply for this job? 

Asking for me.
Oh wow!  That is awesome!  I'm so jealous.
That's sweet and all but... I wouldnt want my face gnawed off in the middle of the night.
Just like a living soft toy to cuddle.
He isn't a caretaker, he's a large cat biologist and he has youtube videos on big cat behavior. He is demonstrating that they will exhibit "cuddling" in order to share warmth during cold nights.
How do I get this job?
This man has got to be sleeping soundly knowing these 3 animals care for him like this.
And my parents told me office jobs are the best. Liars!
That was freaking adorable!

This reminds me of me and my uncle playing stick the ham when I was little
I want to volunteer to spoon with cheetahs!
That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening. He was seeing if cheetahs prefer blankets and a human or concrete.
Aw I wish I had a giant cat to snuggle at night.
Gimme! I want one!
I love how the first cat put the leg over the third cat. So cute
What an incredible job
This is fascinating. I would never have guessed that a Cheetah would be anxious. Thank you!
His name is Dolph C. Volker. His YouTube channel link is https://www.youtube.com/c/DolphCVolker
Even though there‚Äôs no audio I like to think they‚Äôre purring
Cat people, man.
Kittehs!
Jesus christ, look at that cuddle puddle!
/u/tremblario97
This dude has a YouTube channel, and he is not comforting them, he wanted to record what would happen if a human tried to sleep in their enclosure.

Edit with link to vid: https://youtu.be/i3waAOcJkps
I know they're wild animals, but I need to have a cheetah at some point in my life before I die.

I WANT MY JOB TO BE CHEETAH CUDDLER IN CHIEF.
I want to sleep in a cheetah pile.
[removed]
TIL cheetahs sleep like pitties - in a pile, as close as possible.
Just need a hug and a cuddle.
Damn my own cat isn't even this cuddly
My Labrador does the same thing at night, and gets the same treatment.
"What do you mean I can't bring my emotional support human on the bus?!"
Didn't know they were this type of creature. They were just killing machine for me.
Adorable but they're still wild animals and should be respected as such
Wow....my cat fucking sucks.
awwww
Cheetahs are fucking softies, their like the Greyhound version of cats.

They are super anxious and fragile.
I don‚Äôt care what you say that a big spotted cat with the mentality of a doggo
They cuddle more than my dog 

My dog hates cuddling
This is his channel. I think what he does is so cool.


https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC25bqOksVyD-SfdAToam-Bg
I don't know how many of you would be interested but there's a really cool YouTube channel called tier zoo that goes over a lot of different animals, the cheetahs actually super interesting because they really aren't that big of a threat and are actually hunted down by lions because other than their speed there's not much to them.
My cat it‚Äôs exactly the same.
Why are they so anxious? Because they were rescued?
Just hold me...
Man, people get paid to snuggle cheetahs. Absolutely wild üòç
If I wasn't allergic to cats, I'd love this job.
Not really a caretaker. More like a volunteer. They werent nervous, just social or liked the warmth of his body. I exchanged a couple of words with him. He visits them from time to time and this was kinda an experiment :)

I've seen the video of this.  The guy just wanted to know what they did at night.  He found out they really like blankets over a flat hard ground and they sleep for about an hour at a time before they move and find a new position.
How incredible, sleeping with those huge cats.

Reddit is getting pathetic with the reposts.  Can't even wait 24 hours now to do it.
Imagine trying to rob a dude and just seeing him laying next to 3 cheetahs
TIL cheetahs are great spooners
How do I go from here to there?
This would be amazing to experience!
What do you do for a living? Oh, I'm a stay at home mom for giant fur babies. Lol
This same way me and my dad and mom sleep since I was kidding ,I can feel the bond between them
Get them a dog friend too
So jealous!
Cheetahs are the chihuahuas of the feline kingdom
That's beautiful! Thanks for posting.
Omg this is so adorable
Why is my job not sleeping and cuddling with cheetahs?

Nice

Oh geez the cuddle pile so cute! 

Cheetahs fur is quite rough, being licked by one is like being licked by a cat, only way bigger.
I just found out you can buy a cheetah cub for 1,200-2500. Damn I might get me a cheetah in the near future
Dude have the ballz of steel
This is why aliens will find humans terrifying. Earth's top tier predators, we think they're cute. And even though they have fangs and claws, we keep them as pets and feed them so they don't have to hunt.
wholesome
cat can't become dog but cat can become big cat
Therapy human
Omg, my heart
TIL cheetahs = Viszlas.
Man, I wish I could sleep cuddled up to a big cat like that all night long...
Don't hurt animals
I wish my cat would do the same thing for me or at least be generous enough to not chase roaches on to my bed in the middle of the night giving me a heart attack but that aside, this is a really sweet scene üê±üêàü¶ÅüêØüêÖüêÜ
Made my day
This made my year
The cheetahmen
It‚Äôs amazing... They are so cute ü•∫
Here kitty kitty

Tiger King Reboot in the making?
A cat is a cat is a cat.
Wait I want a giant cat to cuddle in the middle of the night
This is the most blessed video I have seen
Everybody liked that
Is it just me or do cheetahs feel more like large dogs than large cats
I need to know why they might be nervous and where was this filmed and why do they need a caretaker in the first place? Are they being hunted by poachers or something?

How can I get this job!?
I would love to do that. Looks cozy.
Wild kitty cuddle!
How can I achieve cheetah cuddle puddle?
He just wanted to go piss
And here I sit with my dumbass degree in stupid computers.
This would be the best job in the world
Aww
***I can't feel my arm anymore but I've reached happiness***
Cheetah pile!!

Cuddle puddle!
They sleep like my great dane! This is amazing!
Oh got it
Aren‚Äôt they cold? Dude has a bunch of blankets on him like the temp is low. The way they‚Äôre stretching the Cheetahs don‚Äôt seem anxious either. Same way my cat wakes up in the middle of the night and snuggles me because she‚Äôs cold
So basically a dog cat
This is the channel of the dude.

No they aren't getting nervous, just don't like hard, cold, and wet concrete.
I'm confused. Is it a dog or a cat??
That's a weird dogp
why does only he gets to cuddle... we also want same
I have never been more jealous of another person in my entire life
