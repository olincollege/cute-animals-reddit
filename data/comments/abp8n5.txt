" Please, I just want to love you!  Why you push me away?"
This is exactly how I wanted to start my new year. Thank you! 
You can see why scrappy became such an arsehole to scooby and the gang 
Again again again!
Is there anything in life better than a puppy? I don't think so.
I just keep thinking of this sad scene where the dog owner is trapped in some rubble and pushes the dog out to try to let it escape and survive but all she does is come back to her master
My Father always did this to our Shih-Tzu and she loved it. He would call it Doggy Hockey. She's been gone for about 12 years now. One of the best friends I've ever had. Sorry for the emotional spill but this just instantly brought back a flood of memories playing on the linoleum floor with her and a bunch of Legos and toys.

i am de pup

we do de *s l i d e*

i run to fren

across de floor

he push me back

i run for more

de play is good -

is much rehearse

but don know why

am in reverse . . . 



What breed is she?
Yeah that's cute and all but sliding around on slippery floors as a pup is thought to be on of the causes of hip problems in adult dogs. 
Don't want to stop the cuteness. But if you overdo this, the friction will cause the skin on the paws getting hurt. Had a cat that was running around like a crazy on such floors when we played fetch until he left tiny little bloody paw prints on the floor. 
I think it's more your favorite game than hers. 
She gets to run to her human without ever having to run away from him. 
/u/gifreversingbot
Dude, that's not a game. She's wondering why you keep pushing her away. My father used to do the same thing to me
I want progress videos of this as the dog gets bigger. 
I love how she loves it!
Good puppy playing fetch with its own body.
Was dying to watch you hug her at least once throughout the video :/
*Your* new favourite game. Puppy just wants to cuddle.

You should call him boomerang

If you love something, let it free. If it comes back, it was meant to be.
Now, just add a tiny mop to each paw.

Boom. Clean house.
Cuuuute lol fast forward a few years when she's muuuch bigger and still wants to play xD
Oh god, please be weary of this. My dad used to do this to my moms dog. We all thought she loved it because she kept coming back like this. Eventually she got the the point that if anyone puts their hands on her sides, she full on attacks. Luckily she weighs all of 3lbs, but it‚Äôs been 5 years now and she‚Äôs still like it. 
My only question is how this was discovered
She's making you play fetch with her as the ball.
10/10 - 11/10 if there were sweet sweet pupper fetch noises. We demand the raw footage. 
I can't watch this without hearing a sliding noise in my head lol
I was distracted because I have the same exact flooring. I know no one probably cares, just speaking my mind. Anyway, I'd try this with either of my dogs, but they're 80 pounds.
Don't do it once unless you are prepared to do it twenty times. 
I wanted you to pick her up and cuddle her so bad
INB4 reddit thinks this is animal abuse
I love to do this with my dog
This is a good workout for you too!
I used to do this with my long gone Chihuahua when he was a puppy. (I tried with my current Chi when he was a puppy and it just hurt his feelings.)

We don‚Äôt deserve dogs.

This is cute, but if the breed is prone to hip dyspraxia slipping so much at a young age could set them up for issues later in life.
How does one figure this out ? Did doggy bug you and you're like "f off and pushed doggy" thus this reult ?
RIP your hardwood lol love the puppy slides ..will be interesting to see how she does when she's older
Hate to be a buzzkill but I don't see much evidence that the animal is enjoying this.
Most likely his new favorite game. 
Looks like the dogs trying to get around him, probably for food! Looks cruel to meüò§
She actually wants to be close to him but doesn't understand why he keeps pushing her away
That friction is too less right? Her paws won't be burning or something? Idk i hope it shouldn't, she is too cute so I was just worrying. She is loving it then definitely it shouldn't hurt or burn but idk maybe I'm overthinking. 
I think we have the same flooring! Don‚Äôt have a pupper to slide around though :( 
Is that real wood or porcelain tile?
What if she just wants a hug and you keep pushing her away?
That is so adorable 
Does it ever stop?
zhooooom!
Do it again!! Do it again!!
Dogs love laminate flooring. Endless slidey mayhem.
This made me smile so hard it hurts 
I do this to my dog! She's fully grown and about 10lbs but thinks she's a german shepherd. I flip her on her back so she slides farther and doesn't have to worry about her feet. The fluffiness makes for some extra protection too!
I JUST WANT A HUG!!!
If I tried this with my cat he would just lay down and expect cuddles. 
Not as good as the trash panda being thrown onto the couch like a kid being launched in the air by their oddly buff uncle in the pool at grandmas house. 
Used to play this with my dog, except he's about 5 times the size so I could only push him about half the distance, and he's so strong he'd be back almost instantly.

I got exhausted and the floors got scratched.

We used to do this with my dog, except we would spin her around in a circle a few times before we pushed her across the floor. Then she‚Äôd start running immediately even while she was sliding backwards, just like a Looney Toons character.

I remember the first time I got a dog
We had smooth floors like this when my dog was a pup. Her favorite thing to do was go running then slide under the dining room chair & she stopped under the table. She could entertain herself this way for ages. 

The first time she tried to do it when she had grown too big, she ran into the chair which fell over her (the four legs were around her, not ON her and she wasn't hurt at all). She froze and then just looked at us like it was our fault or that we had changed the chair. She looked both mad and upset. 

She wasn't hurt so it was hilarious.

My cat likes to do something similar. I‚Äôll pick her up & toss her lightly onto my bed. She‚Äôll flop around for a second, then comes running back to do it again.

She also likes lying on the wood floor and letting me spin her around.
When you asked for a boomerang and you got this dog...
My cousin's beagle loved this game too.  Except the floor was carpet so I gently lobbed her a few feet and she could hardly get back to me fast enough when she landed for another go.
I read a meme once that really changed my perspective, "Maybe it isn't that dogs like to play fetch, but rather they hate losing things?"

So this automatically made me think, "Maybe he doesn't like being pushed, but rather hates being away from you?"

So maybe, this is torture for the poor pup?
What if she just wants a hug?
RemindMe! 366 days 
This is a perfect opportunity to teach ‚Äúcome‚Äù! The dog is already playing a game that involves running back to you and allowing you to grab them. Just start saying come while they‚Äôre running toward you, say yes when they get to you, and then sliding them is their reward.

I cannot play this game with an 85 lb lab.
It's also a great exercise move
