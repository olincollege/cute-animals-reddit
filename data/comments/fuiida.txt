#Here come the hotstepper
I had a dog that just loved hide and seek. One of us would hold the dog while the other person would hide. He wouldn't stop until he found you and he'd be so proud of himself. Such a good boy.
EXTREME r/TippyTaps

WHAT A BEAUTIFUL GAL!!!!!
Literally can't tell if she has that genetic disorder or just pure joy
Reason #378,987 why I love dogs
Not sure if this is a repost. Don't care if it is. This made me real happy. 

Hope your doggo makes the front page!
Does he see me ? Does he see me ? Does he see me ? 
He see me - ruff
I'm actually pretty impressed with her ability to stay on here feet despite all the flopping around.
The derp of love

This is exactly the kind of content I come here for! What a beautiful, derpy dance she does - thanks for sharing!

‚ÄúYOU FOUND ME YOU FOUND ME YOU FOUND MEEE‚Äù
Is her name Dork? Because that's a dork if I ever saw one
Oh my god! This is everything!! So adorable
Oh goodness this made me laugh harder than I was expecting üòÇ
*"Hello, my baby! Hello, my honey! Hello, my ragtime gal'!"*
Awww her little hippy hops! :)
Wow, I can‚Äôt even get my dog to acknowledge my existence half the time!
Ahhhh was she so excited she couldn't release a bork til the very end?
Sooooooo cute!!!!!

Adorable baby! It must be a huge but delightful responsibility to be loved like that.
OMG she's the sweetest! üíúüíôüíöüíõüß°‚ù§
More hide n seek dog PLEASE
r/animalsbeingderps
This made me laugh in cuteness in the middle of my awful depression tonight thank u
Is she just SO HAPPY she forgot how to walk, or does she have a neurological problem/older? Sorry if that seems weird to ask, but I work with dogs and I've seen dogs with neurological or spinal problems like  that where they can't really control their legs too well, and I got curious. Could just be she forgot how to dog in her excitement lol  
Also I used to have a lab who would play hide and seek with this toy mouse. We'd lock him in a bedroom (He'd run there whenever we got the mouse), hide the mouse somewhere in the house, and then let him out. He'd search the house and always find it. He was so good at finding his mouse! We'd always say "Where's your mouse?" and he'd almost always immediately go into whatever room we had put the mouse. We had to start taking the time to walk around the house before and after hiding it to throw him off a bit. And he knew that if we hid the mouse somewhere before, we wouldn't hide it there again, so he wouldn't look in the same place unless he really couldn't find it, and it would be like "Ok, I can't find it. Did you guys put it in that place I found it last time?"
I‚Äôm *howling* at this! You have the derpiest dog in the universe! 

I thought Allie Brosh of [Hyperbole and a Half](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2011/04/wild-animal-simple-dog-goes-for-joy.html?m=1) had the derpiest dog. But no. No, your dog wins. 

And he made me laugh harder than I have in a week. Thank you. That was wonderful.
Dogs are glowing beacons of cuteness and joy
she's so excited to play with you
That is one cute puppy!
That‚Äôs a kangaroo
She loves you so much!
Reminds me of my son when he was little (3/4). He loved to play hide and seek, but he wanted you to hide with him. He 1) always hid in the same place and 2) talked to you while you hid with him. 

His heart is made of pure gold.
Those jumps of joy made my day!
What a dance!
What a goof! üòç
That‚Äôs a ‚Äúprancing‚Äù dog lol.
I do the same dance when I stub my toe.
She‚Äôs Sooooooo cute!!!
Omg my name is also Sarah I‚Äôm so happy to share a name with such an adorably cute and happy puppy how old is she?

How is it even possible to play hide and seek with adog. They are always so excited that its hard to hide.
God damnit this is adorable. Just what the doctor ordered.
We do not deserve dogs.

My little one asked to see the 'wobbly dog's today, but I didnt save the last video I showed her. She will be thrilled to see this!

Sarah, you are precious!
I love this dog
OMG that little dance is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
Is she a wobbly doggo or was she just being a funny derp just then?
That one was creating a distraction while the other one ran to another hiding spot!
Oh my god. I love your dog! We don't deserve animals.
Oh my gosh this is so cute! Her hops make me so happy
Omg she's a good girl.
That was simply delightful, thanks for posting, OP!
I just fricken full blown cackle laughed at this. Thank you so much, tell Sarah she‚Äôs the absolute bomb
My childhood dog would play hide and seek with us. I'd have her lay down in the kitchen and stay, then I'd run into the other room and hide. Either behind the curtains, in the closet, behind the couch, or even in cupboards. Then I'd call her - she was so good, she wouldn't come until she was called - and she'd carefully listen to hear me and find me. SO CUTE! I love this post!
I remember! It‚Äôs that jumpy dog!
WATCH OUT FOR THAT BIG ASS SNAAAAAKE!!
Oh, wait. Nevermind.
I want dog.
Is she an Akbash?
Nobody in their entire life has ever had more fun playing hide and seek. Ever.
Omg! That prance lol
I think that‚Äôs a deer
Thanks for a laugh.
God why are dogs so smart??! And cute!
Herp derps AND tippys
That‚Äôs a deer bro.
This is the goofiest dog, she's adorable! It's so great you have this much fun together.
Ur dog is absolutely adorable. I would be playing that game with my dog every chance I got if he had the same reaction
Went to a bark park one day. Saw an elderly man literally play hide and seek with his golden retriever. Super intelligent boye would actually wait as his master counted to 10 slowly to hide. The elderly owner had plenty of trees to hide behind. Caught the attention of everyone nearby as the owner reached 10. The Golden retriever went into search mode instantly and sniffed out his owners trail gradually to a few trees until finally he found the right tree his master was hiding behind. I'm sure lots of people do this with their dogs, but just seeing it in person was a better feel than on video. This quarantine sucks, it's something that we take for granted but simply taking your doggo to the bark park is really relaxing and enjoyable. Especially seeing how excited they really get as well as how much they don't want to leave.
I don‚Äôt know why but I read ‚ÄúTOO EXCITED‚Äù as ‚ÄúTOO INTOXICATED‚Äù.
That‚Äôs some next level tippy taps
One of the cutest videos I‚Äôve seen today! Thanks for sharing.
I love that dog. Hoppy hop boy.
Living her best life
[deleted]
Aww. I love your sweet girl.
I love the happy hops! You brought me pure joy.
How can you teach a dog how to play hide and seek?
derp dance
Genuine question: does this dog have a neurological disorder or balance issues? Most dogs I see with issues like that move just like this. 

Otherwise, she looks very healthy and happy.
Lol,omg so cute,I thought it was gonna be how my dog would get wagging his tail&running around a bit but she was doing a whole lil hopping dance,adorable
That is the cutest thing I have even seen in my whole life
I was gonna try to think of something funny to say but the doggo is just too cute and it melted my brain
Omg the happy dance ü•∞
My mom has a CH dog too. So cute!
This is the happiest little dog I've ever seen, at least it wasn't inside
What a complete goofball good girl.
Protect this pupper at all costs
Omg.   Cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all week.   Congrats
Omg. I just cannot. What a precious dear.‚ù§
What kind of dog? I had a stray I found when I was a kid that looked just like it
Oh My
Day 1: I found a cute video. i upvote 

Day 378: I watch this on repeat 300 times
I love this! We had a dog when I was growing up and we'd play hide and seek inside with him. One of us would hold him at the top of the stairs and the other would hide in the basement. After we hid, we'd yell "Albert, come find me!' Then he'd race down the stairs. He was such a good pup.
I just got back from work after a long week and found this on my feed.  Dogs are so pure, but this girl is one of the purest.  Thanks for sharing!
This. This is the cutest shit I have ever done damn seen.
I just wanna hug her.  She is the happiest.  Thank you posting these.  I never get sick of her.
After everything that‚Äôs going on with the pandemic I needed this ! Thank you so much ! :) it popped up on my newsfeed and I had to watch it a couple of times. Thank you for making my night
I don't know about hide and go seek, but your dog is *fantastic* at hide and go derp.
Superstar Sarah!!!! I just love her!!!
I needed this today. Felt happy for a few seconds forget about everything that was going on. Thank you.
We taught our BIG black lab Tango to look for my daughter. She would go hide and I would start asking him "Wheeeeere's Abby?!!?! Wheeeere's Abby?!?!!?" He would get really excited and ZOOM around looking for her them crash into her repeatedly when he found her while we laughed hysterically. Good times!
It‚Äôs like she is always just floating on clouds
Almost 75,000 views in 7 hours!  And deserved!  Lol

She is just the best thing ever! I love all your videos of her. Thanks for sharing!

I've never seen a creature do such alien movements, it looks like a cartoon.
This looks like me trying to run away from something in a bad dream.
Guess I have to share this with my GF, Sarah, now. I've found her spirit animal.
I‚Äôm waiting for an animal expert in the comments to go UHM AKCHULLY THAT IS A SIGN OF EXTREME STRESS AND THE DOG IS ABOUT TO SNORT OUT ITS BRAIN THROUGH ITS KNOWS ACTCHILLY
I am obsessed with your adorable dog! Thank you for the videos!!
Aww this poor dog has a neurological disorder :(

We play hide and seek too! Lol my mom or I hide and the dogs find us. Lolz it‚Äôs funny
Ever looked into Cataplexy? Just saying cuz I‚Äôve got a dog whose back legs used to give out when over-stimulated/excited. It‚Äôs a weird form of canine narcolepsy. We have an Rx for it now. As she got older it got more debilitating if that makes sense. I dunno just in case you wanted to be safe and check it out. Not trying to worry you!
This is the sweetest thing I‚Äôve ever seen!

I try to play hide and seek with my daughter and my dog just goes crazy and gives us away every time. He does not like us trying to hide from him!

How do you get your dog to play hide and seek?
I'm such a cat person but I honestly don't understand dogs? Why are they so happy lol? And why is he so excited over hiding ?
Sweet Jesus this is too adorable. How do you train a dog to play hide and seek? I've never seen a dog that does that.
Well this is heart-warming and all but you can't play hide and seek with a dog... Cmon man don't lie in the title.
Appears to be a meth lab.
Stop making the Chinese hungry
Haha that things tarded
How the hell do you teach a dog hide and seek?
I am confuselled. How on earth in gods heaven did you spot her?

All I saw was a stoopid dog owner being clever, pretending to spot her, and then getting called out doggo stule.
Are you sure she wasn't having a seizure?
By shit that dog is definitely on the spectrum.
Eww they look disgusting
I'm a veterinarian.  That dog has worms in its ass.
