I love that the golden one is the more excited even though he doesn't have the stick, he's egging on his friend at the start
I love them
When I grow up, I want to be as happy as they are.
Those excited tippy taps are adorable.
This is the cutest thing I've seen in weeks.
"That's from both of us."
when the yard only has the one twig but you still give it your all
I cannot handle how adorable they are !
"Look tiny stick tiny stick, did you know sticks come this tiny"
DidIdogoodDidIdogoodDidIdogoodDidIdogood
"Oh my gosh, Carl, should I show her????" 
"Yeah, show her. Oooooh"
"OK okokokokokok ok here it is.. yes"
"She's not gonna- oop she's gonna throw it! WIGGLE"
Dontcha know! Good things do come in small packages! That or find the joy in the little things!
The yellow one cracks me up
r/tippytaps !!
I had a black and yellow lab. Just recently lost my black lab, after almost 15 years. They used to act like this. This really made my day! Thank you for sharing :)
This is fantastick. You should be proud of them as well.
Lol. The look the black one is giving it, though…😆
omg those excited taps from yellow lab of "I sorta helped too! Now let's play fetch!!"
This is so precious. I hope all dogs experience this happiness in their lifetimes!
Labs want you to throw ANYTHING. Mine used to bring me drinking straws, dice, a peanut, you name it and then wait with that anticipating face and that big smile. "Come on, Mom! THROW it!!"

Adorable.
It’s the small and simple things in life that bring the biggest joy and smiles. This is that and that is this.
Now where is the treat you heartless hooman?!
It’s not the size of the stick, it’s how you use it.
Such happy goobers
It's just the best stick ever!
Throw the stick mom!!!😂😂😂
  
It made me smile in a way I haven't had in a long time THANK YOU
Labs are adorable. So smart and so stupid at the same time somehow.
why am I crying
Awww. That is adorable
Well this is just the purest thing I've ever seen
My lab does the same thing, she will avoid the big sticks to bring back the smallest ones to play fetch with instead.
Oh my goodness, they're too cute!
This is so precious! Protect at all costs
Aww those precious pups 😆😆😆
Give 'em a treat!
Oh my gosh this so priceless
And the fancy feet of the blond one just waiting for you to throw it lol
Awww babies, so proud of their joint effort!
Haha! The way that puppo is so excited! Way too cute!
Tap tap tippity tap tap tap
So fucking cute!
There was more slobber than stick!
This might crack the top 20 of cutest things I’ve ever seen
LITTLE STICK! LITTLE STICK! LITTLE STICK!
Labs are the biggest goofballs.
/u/reddditsave
Oh, my heart. It's full of kitties, but these two puppers just nudged their way in.
I think your dogs are trolling you.

You have to love doggies even when the get hair over everything. They mean well.
The golden dog has dance moves
*YESYESYESYES BRING HER THE STICK BRING HER THE STICK HERE GIVE IT TO HER YESYESYESYES*
He was so happy the tail was wagging him 😊
The “show her, show her” at the beginning
Time to turn off my computer. This is as good as it gets.
Throw my stick
This is so damn cute 😍  How anyone could hurt any sort of animal is beyond me!
Totally deserving of an awwww.
As they should be
This made my day 😁
I love this more than anything else!!!
So they should be. Good job guys!
BEST VIDEO ON THIS APP, EVER!
Adorable!
Happy tappy
A job well done
I love how it took 2 of them to bring that tiny stick and they’re both so excited about it
What a couple of dorks!
Throw it, throw it, throoooow ittttt
Yellow lab: "THROWIT/THROWIT/THROWIT/THROWIT/THROWIT/THROWIT/THROWIT/THROWIT..."
"LOOK WHAT WE FOUND!!!"
I want a dog so bad 😢
*Yeah yeah yeah throw it throw it throw it yeah yeah yeah!!!*
“I did good, I did a good job, I’m a good boy.”
Dogs: "Throw it! Throw it! Come on throw it!"
That yellow dog is unreal happy. He’s exactly like my chocolate lab.
“Come on let’s show mom”
That’s the fairy king’s Shillelagh
I feel like the yellow one at the beginning was quietly and quickly whispering excitedly, "C'mon, show 'em, show 'em, show 'em!...."
“Oh boy oh boy she’s gonna love this one!!”
The real question is. What do they know about that piece of stick that we dont? 🤔
Made my day
"Did I do good?, Did I do good? Please pet me and tell me I did good."
Throw it, throw it, throw it!!!
i just lost my boy saturday, thank you for this.
I bet they thought it was hilarious.  "Hey (chuckle) let's find (chuckle) let's find like the smallest (haha) the smallest stick...and...and (hahaha) and bring it to (snicker) the...the human to play FETCH! (HAHAHA)"
Those are some very sweet doggies
Awww this made my day!
That is so cute and adorable 🥰
u/RedditMP4Bot
I got my husky mix to fetch once,  he retrieved a stick a few times then on about the 4th toss he ran right past the stick we were using and picked  up the tiniest little twig(about 2”) and brought it back to me , dropped it at my foot and proceeddd to give me this look like “throw this one bitch”.  Then he walked away.
This is my video, please give me credit. I usually wouldn’t mind but you took my tik tok username off of it. It’s kaseymiller9
Gold one: "show her, show her, show her"

Black one: "I know I know, here"

Gold one: "CHECK IT OOOOOUT! Impressive shit aint it!".
Labs are the best! perfect combination of smarts and derps
Me, turning in my thesis.
"WHAT am I supposed to do with this?"

"Throw it!  Throw it!" *wag 💗 wag 💗 wag 💗*
Gold lab: “Show him, show him!”
*excited sounds*
Throw it, throw it! Omg he's gonna throw it! THROW IT!
We. Are. ***ＬＡＢＲＡＤＯＲ!!***
Give both of them kisses and tell them that they are good doggies. NOW
"AND WHAT DO YOU THINK, WHAT DO YOU THINK??" -wiggle-wiggle-tap-tap-
Comon! Throw the stick! *Throw the stick!*
"Yo Mom, check this shit out. Show her Doug."
I’m saving this as a pick me up for the future.
“DUDE DUDE DUDE SHOW MOM WHAT WE FOUND!!”
loveley...i wish i got him
dogs are so dumb I love it
I had two happy dogs as them, sadly both of them passed away during lockdown 🙂. It really created a void in my and my family's life but we're still going on. 😁
The show must go on. ❤️
Oh goodness, just when I think I’ve seen the most cutest thing in my life, here comes THIS. I could watch this all day. Seriously. U must be so happy u got this on video. I’ve never lived anywhere I can have my own dog, someday.... but oh my god how FREAKIN CUTE was that?! 😭😭😭 they are the Goodest of boys, who deserve the bestest of treats. 😍😍😭😭
It’s like a stick. But smaller.
"Show mom!  Show mom!"
I don't like dogs but I like this
.
theyre the goodest doggos ever
So cute.  I want to see the fetch after you toss it!  should cross post to animals being derps too!
This made me smile
I think this is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen on Reddit. My heart is happy.
Best wing man ever!
Funniest thing all day!
Their dumb is the cutest thing ever
 They want you to throw it!
I hope the humor wasn't lost in these dogs. Hilarious
that’s pretty damn adorable.
That takes way more skill than finding and fetching a big stick.
See guys! Size DOESNT matter
That deserves a free award!
Quality not quantity.
THROW IIIIIIT!!!
Good boy!!
This is adorable lol
It's always way to big or way to small
Soo cute!!
Anyone else think they were bringing a dead mouse?
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen
Love the yellow lab just being the hype man in the background.
It’s so adorable how the left dog needed to make sure it was safe on the approach. 😂
Absolutely adorable!
Wow this got reposted from tiktok FAST
They are following the “be happy with what you have” rule
That gave me such a deep belly chuckle. That dance…!
Them's great happy doggies.
I laughed for a solid 5 minutes! Yellow lab is SO excited!
Dogs are so weird and that's why I love them
Hahahaha!!
Did you play fetch with it?  

That adorable pupper looks like he's waiting for you to throw it.
My lab was exactly like this, one time when there was nothing else around he brought a paper match to throw.  Sorry bud, I don't think that's gonna work...
This just made my day, that’s awesome
I'm pretty sure this is the cutest thing I've EVER seen ☺️😁
It’s a good size
My heart!!!
That dog wants to play the words tiniest game of fetch.
haha the golden!
I was running the other day and paused at traffic light. All I see is this dog jumping up off the ground trying to bite this huge stick it’s owner was holding; it was a wholesome site to see!
"Well..whataya think??"
Oh my gosh I love them so so so much I can't handle it!
r/TippyTaps
A stick, is a stick no matter how small
Throw the big stick tippy taps are adorable.
So freaking adorable.  Totally made my day🤗
OMGOSH!!!! I could not stop laughing….They are SOOOO proud….❤️🥰😍
Absolutely adorkable!
r/animalsbeingderps
Lmao this is such a lab move. They’re such dorks.
This is probably the funniest dog joke you can pull on a human. “Give them the smallest stick and pretend your proud”
If only we could wire dogs to think cash and sticks are the same. Imagine these dudes bringing back a dollar every time.
They are adorable! Labs are the best :)
This is the purest thing I've seen in months.
Playwiththedamndogs!
/r/tippytaps
We don't discriminate between sticks around here sir.
I guess size doesn't matter with dogs.
"I bet we can get the hooman to throw this."


"Hell, yes, Doug, let's do it. Make sure to act excited. Maybe we can get the rectangle to come out too!"
How cute!
AWESOME! Lol!
Silly, silly Labs!!!  If we didn't have GSDS, we'd definitely have Labs!

Our old female GSD would tear cardboard boxes into confetti.  Then she would bring you a piece of confetti about the size of your pinkie finger nail and expect you to frisbee it for her.  Then she would bring it back to be thrown again.
Such good looking dogs!

But like most good looking things…. not too sharp.

I still love them.
Never have I loved a dog so much for being so proud for so little
Yo i was having a bad day today until I saw this
That is one of the funniest and cutest things I’ve seen in a long time.
I could watch doggies doing their happy dances all day 🥰
100% serotonin.
Some days you take what you can get!
The wiggles are so cute!
My German Shepherd does the exact same thing! It keeps getting smaller every time I throw it and he brings it back. He finds it by smell be usually.🤣😅👍
ADORABLE
The fact they are both so invested in the smallest twig imaginable, really does make this wonderful.
Hahaha that’s awesome!  Reminds me of when we tell the kids to collect sticks to start a fire….we’re going to need some sticks a little bigger than that guys!
Damn bro, need me to send you some sticks? I got some elm and cedar handy. How bout a nice classic oak one? 😁
Perfect to cross post in r/labrador. Because… who doesn’t love a happy lab?
This could be the goat
Those are amazing dogs !!
Look at those tippy taps
I love dogs.
This is why I love labs so so much!!! Goofballs.
This has the energy of two little kids playing a very gentle prank. I love them.
Holy shit, give those good boys some love for me!!!
Labs are best
The way he dances, lord and savior jesus christ, please bless my soul.
Holy shit, that’s adorable.
Dogs are disgusting! Lol
The doggy dancy dance 😂🤣
The Goldie wanted it, the black one brought it to mom instead of letting the Goldie have it.
I’d like to think this is a dogs version of a “prank”. 

“Omg did you see her face when I gave her that little stick to throw for us?!”
Good lord labs are so dumb
Bless their heart! They're so pure..😭😭
its so cute seeing both of them approach their human and show the teeny stick like 🥰🥰🥰
Exactly like my employees.
HOW can this not have sound? I demand to hear the whining happy panting voices of these absolutely adorable and highly optimistic puppers.
Doggo says size just like your boyfriend....peepee
That used to be a 4 foot long log, until they chewed it down.
Lol they are so happy that’s so funny.!!!
Theeeere he issss, my TINY stick! He’s extra tiny todaaay, yeahh.
That golden is the best hype man ever.
Oh my heart 🥺
Did you take this from animalsbeingderps and succeeded with getting more up votes than that person did?
Omg, this is the cutest!!
/u downloadgif
Shrinkflation is affecting us all
Labs are the greatest dogs every
I wish I could find joy in the small things like these handsome animals feel over that stick.
My aunts BFF has a new chocolate lab. 

We think he is part beaver.
That is friggin cute. So precious.
We need more please
How did you get them to drop it? My lab would make sure I saw he had something, but would never let me take it....No take, only throw.
“We present to youuuuu…. (Drum roll plzzzz)……. THIS LIL STICK!! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)”
❤❤
Black: hey look! A stick!
Blond: That's a cute stick, i bet she'll love it!
...
I like to think they found the little stick hilarious
Hahaha and they deserve every bit of praise that they're expecting 😅
For god sake throw it!
This made my day!
Future branch managers.
some dogs like big sticks, but it takes real talent to find the smallest of sticks.
Why post videos with no audio?
There’s an inside joke you don’t know about!
So cute!!!
Well, look at it!!! That’s a sweet ass stick.
To be fair that's a pretty cool twig.
i wish there was sound lol
I would cherish that twig for as long as I breathe.
It's like they were sharing a dog joke.
“You know what would be hilarious?”
“What?”
“Let’s find the tiniest stick we can find, then present it to our hooman like it’s the greatest thing ever!”
“OMG! I know just the stick!”
It ain't much, but it's honest work
The DANCE.
Dogs are so stupid
This is the first time I’ve smiled in a week
I LOVE Labradors!
Lmaooo
This is how internets are broken
Teamwork makes the dreamwork
r/teamwork
wow i fucking love dogs! that was actually hilarious
reminds me of when little kids show u a drawing they r rlly proud of, so cute :D
This is the best video I’ve seen in a long time. I love the happy dance tippy taps.
You should put a dance number to that jig. Wiggle it, just a little bit, how about that song?
Show this video to anyone about to spend money on a toy
Soooo sweet!
That's a couple of heckin good boys if I ever did see em!
#DOGGOS ARE LIFE!!!!!!!
dogs are so simple and pure.
Hahaha. I think your dogs don’t know how big they are.
ERMERGERD! So much loving this!
“I retrieved.”
I love the Lab hop dance 😄
That's why I love these furry bastards so much they always make me smile and fucking happy
They are so precious!!
The fact that they both thought it was cool
This. This is what life’s all about. Be happy with the little things and enjoy every moment.
Omg 😂 Throw the stick!
I think they're messing with you.
This is so amazing 😭 I miss my two labs. They are the cutest little bugs
It’s these things that make me question, are dogs smart or dumb? I can’t tell. One video, a dog winning a game of tictactoe, the next video, a dog getting excited over a twig.
🥲😍🥰
I'm questioning how *clean* this  OP's backyard must be --- is this the best stick  those adorable doggos could find??
Bro you know how we bring mom big sticks to throw, wouldn't it be hilarious if we brought her this tiny tiny one!
Nice, made me smile
Is that... a twig?
Is that... a twig?
Not proud.. they want you to throw it
Goodest bois
.
I love this 💕
They are just like my girlfriend when she gets to play with my peepe
They're a couple goofs. He was like "how funny would it be if I brought the this tiny baby stick? Lol" "duuuuuude, that would be so funny, let's go" they walked up giggling like little kids you just couldn't tell
We don’t deserve dogs.
I’m so proud of them!
Throw a smaller stick...maybe they wont be so proud...more like vain.
This is what I am on Reddit for
This is why dogs are the best people
Is he waiting for you to throw it? 🥰
This is wildly heartwarming.
My dog would tear up every frisbee to scraps and he would walk up to me and just drop a scrap as thin as paper and wide as a thumb tak. I haven’t see anything like it until now.
Ooh ooh Rate My Stick 

-Crusoe
Wait til they see, wait til they see! Look at this cool stick I found!
I died
The excitement of the yellow is too cute
Need more…
Absolutely adorable!!!!
This is exactly like that scene in holes where Stanley was the one who found the lipstick case but x-ray bullied him into being the one to bring it to the warden.
As the should be
Jesus this is so cute!!!
Heh so cute,  I remember my lil dog gave my x a leaf before.
This is equivalent to your kids bringing home a personal draw picture from Kindergartner
My dogs fight over the littlest piece of floof on the ground..that stick cracks me up
r/tippytaps
okaT me
I think they expect you to throw it.
It’s a stick, it counts. We are dealing with a good boy here.
That’s the greatest thing I’ve seen today.  Genuinely made me lol.
I guess size really doesn't matter then...
Labs,my favorite dog. Always so happy, and if they bring you something, special 💜💜
Omg that blond one was beside himself with excitement!! Sooo cute!
Good dogs. The best doggies. Just……I can’t even find the words! The very best fur babies!!!!

Is that a root or something?!
I hope you threw it for that excited duo
THROW IT!!!!
Can't. Stop. Watching...
I have nothing but respect for children and animals for finding excitement in something so small
Holy crap that’s adorable.
r/tippytaps
Soooo dope!
The cutest thing in the entire world love for them🥰🥰
I HAD to sort by controversial just to see. I’m here to report back the bottom of the comments is upvotes! Faith restored
Genuinely made me laugh! Reminds me of when my cat, Holly, came back in the house with another cat's toy. It was in the shape of a little rooster and he was *so darn proud of himself!*  He played with that thing for ages.
"Dude, dude, dude, dude, show 'im show 'im.... EH? EHHH?"
Dogs are adorable. Pure joy
That little dance.
Fetch:  the Pocket Edition!
Beautiful. God, I need another dog.
I cant stop watching this and I can't stop smiling. Look at these absolute rays of sunshine🥺🤧
just had a really long day at jury duty and was sick all day the previous day feeling rather crappy then i watched this and honestly i feel really good now lol video made my night very fkn cute lmao
That dog thinks is a big stick
I'm not crying
You must have mentioned and they heard that wanted a little stick.
r/throwthedamnstick
Lmao, team effort
reminds me of r/tippytaps
Awwww!
Man I thought it was about to be a baby bunny or something covered in slobber, like how my golden did to us.  Somehow this is way cuter.
They are very good boys!
I get Harry and Lloyd vibes
And it was a group happy!…I hope you made it a big deal.
Give those doggos some love and throw the stick!
Repeat…
Oh my god those bouncy feet and happy faces
I am proud of them for being proud
Lol - well done guys, well done
this is so cute
This reminds me of my sister's dog who excitedly presented me with a 2 inch scrap of tennis ball fabric to throw. 

Ok Lou-Dog, I gotcha boy.
Dogs being the best yet again
THROW IT YOU MONSTER!
I don’t know how I would live with that. I was dying laughing the goldens energy was just too funny. Genuine belly laugh from this video.
Now that’s funny 😁
This makes me so happy. We definitely don’t deserve dogs.
My baby (corgi) only grabs sticks that are easily 8 times her size. There are two types of dogs, I swear 😂
waiting on you to throw it so they can fetch
The wiggle wiggle lol
This is really cute, how do I turn this into a GIF, it would be enjoyable to all?
I feel like it’s a hilarious prank and they’re excited to see your reaction.
Too funny!
Super duper cute!
I bring you the holy stick of Antioch.
They get paid in treats for every stick they collect in the yard… nobody specified on the size of the stick XD
As they should be! Good job team
The tippy tappies were so adorable I almost shat myself
Actually r/mademesmile
I thought he was going to drop a sodden but ultimately unharmed mouse. My dog has done that with birds.
Omgosh this is the whole best thing in the whole internet at this moment !!! I love this
Meraviglioso
He wants you to throw it.
Goodest bois
I feel like I should send your dogs a box of sticks.
As a lab owner, can confirm that this accurate.
LMFAO this is the best thing I’ve seen in a really long time. Thank you for sharing.
This reminds me of my dog. She’ll tear up a toy and then bring me a teeny tiny piece of material for me to throw so she can fetch it. Crazy thing is that she’ll search better for that tiny scrap of material better than for an intact toy.
as they should
What is that?
It’s not as big as you think it is. Ask your wife.
This is just the best thing ever.
Anyone else bring home a stick every time they go hiking?
Because they have good scents
I can’t stop laughing at this. So cute
so cute!!
I need this kind of excitement in my life 🤣
awwhhh
I love Big stick, little stick,
Wide stick, tall stick,
I love this stick
That stick
Hide stick
All stick
Maybe the best r/tippytaps I’ve ever seen 😩🤗🥰🥰
This is beautiful
Baaabyyy stick do doo do do doooo
Was a wish bone The master had to hold to make it fair
Oh my gosh!! So adorable! I wish I could have a dog!!!
I have a lab mix and if this doggy is and like my pup they want the stick to be thrown. My pup always brings me the goofiest things to play fetch with
Throw the damn stick
u/rip-video
OMG, this gave me all the feels!
2 very smart dogs, he's so proud of that trophy hahaha...
Little hunnies😍
Thanks for posting this - made my day
I'm laughing thinking of that cartoon with 'How many ___ dogs does it take to change a lightbulb?'  or whatever

The lab:  OH MY GOD WHAT ARE WE DOING CAN I HELP THIS IS AWESOME
The golden doggie - he's so excited, those PAWS.  I can't ❤
Holy, watching that golden pounce like that made me want to steal him😥
Almost like the dog is trolling the human.  Meta af
Hey, it's the slobber stick!
From personal experience once you run out of even tiny sticks, dogs will bring you grass stems
Desperate times I see
Doggo bros
This was really cute.
I cannot get over how excited the Golden lab is! He is so happy! I can totally see my two dogs doing the same thing.
So cute lol
I love Labs so much. They give 100% no matter what they're doing
xD
Ugh. We don’t deserve dogs. I hope they were rewarded the biggest of hugs and lots of doggie treats
What is this? Fetch for ants?
The best boys
SOOOOO CUTE!!!
Precious.
Wow they remind me of my old dogs, even the mannerisms are the same
Lesson from my dog; 
Enjoy the simple things in life
Oh my goodness, my heart. That’s so fucking cute. My two are lovable idiots and I can’t touch one without the other wanting attention too, they are such lovely boys my two and I couldn’t be without them.

Omg he is so freaking cute I wanna hug it
It’s not the size of the gift, it’s the thought that counts! LOL and they love you so much!!
It’s not about the size…
This reminds me of Dragon and Nighthawk from Step Brothers so much...
Oooooooooooooohhhh he founds the stik:)
Dog: just play with us
This is the cutest thing I've seen in too long! 🥰🥰🥰
Dog #1 "Hey let's do a prank"

Dog #2 "Yea, that would be funny"

Dog #1 "What should we do?"

Dog #2... 

&#x200B;

(you could hear them howling in laughter all that night)
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
This is so wholesome
We don’t deserve dogs.
That is so fuking cute
give them a treat! they did a good job!
My neighbors golden retriever used to turn whatever I threw into a tennis ball. I’d throw a rock into a bush and she’d come back with a ball. If I threw a ball she’d come back with that same ball if she found other balls she’d drop it outside the bush and then go back to it.
Give credit where it’s due and tag the actual creator and don’t crop their name out you creep. @kaseymiller9 on TikTok is the actual video
With all due respect, they are both Labs, just different colors.
This reminds me of most artwork I got from my niece s and nephews. It's usually horrible but I'm always thrilled by their tenacity.
As they should be, that’s a Grade-A stick my dude
This hurts my heart. My GSD used to love bringing sticks for me to throw. She'd give them a little crunch each time she brought them back, until they were literally tiny pieces of mulch. I would still have to throw them and she would do a little bark and dance while she waited for me.
Reminds me of the time my dog brought a live rat to the door
His little tippy taps though 😩😍
Shaqwiggling.gif
LOOK AT THE STICK!
I wonder if dogs play jokes on us. Like, I can imagine me being a dog in another life going DUDE DUDE what if, hear me out WHAT IF.. we brought our human a TINY stick… tee hee. That’s what I see here.
Lol too cute
This is more preferable than the giant-stick-surprise from behind trick.
Tippy taps
This made me bust out laughing. Thanks i needed this
Throw the twig, you monster.
Now THATS a stick!
That Goldie is everything
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve seen in awhile.
Dogs are dorks haha
The sise don’t matter
Lol
My partner and I at work trying to impress the boss
That’s some nice looking dinner
Could also be posted in /animalsbeingderps
Hey let’s see how dumb our human is ... let’s pretend we’re really excited about this silly little stick and see if we can get them to pick it up with slubba all over it 😊
I am so happy and charmed right now!
My black lab will fetch with a still for a bit, then chew and fetch again. All the while it gets smaller and smaller until he's bringing me essentially a wood chip that is throw.
I love dogs so much.
Of course they're proud, that's about $50 of lumber
c'mon c'mon throw it c'mon!

Ha! My GS will run up to me so excited, with the smallest stick in her teeth that’s not protruding out of her mouth. There’s nothing there. I can tell by the way her jaw is sitting and her enthusiasm. Makes me smile every time 😂
Hi
Epigenetics is complicated.
I’m sure this comment has been made but drum roll......they are both labs!
I’ve been prouder of less, nice work boys!
'Cause they are labs.  Joy is their base emotion
Oh my heart. They couldn’t be happier.
“Look! Look! Isn’t it awesome! He found it but I was there too and I helped!!!” Lol. They are too cute!
Hey
God, I love dogs.
That's the greatest thing I have ever seen.

My chocolate labs does the same shit hahahah. I friggin love her.
This is fucking adorable.
It's not the size, it's how you use it.
These two comedians. Let’s give mom the smallest stick in the world. They were losing it. Love it.
This is almost too much to handle.
Oh my God, that is so adorable and precious and ridiculous and utterly hilarious
Man I love labs. They are so funny.
It’s my cake day
😻😂🥰😍😻😹
I can't get over how cute when the light one starts bouncing!!!!
So cute holy shit
Harry and Lloyd vibes.
A stick is a stick
"We have stopped a tiny archer from invading the home, are you pleased?"
"Hey hey show that to mama! She'll praise us alot when she sees this cute tiny stick!"
The best
How adorable 😍😍
Be as proud of your friends as that golden retriever is omg
Made my day 🥰
Get your dogs a respectable stick, ya monster!

Smart puppies
I could watch that happy dance all day
I just snorted laughed bc they were so proud  of themselves and doing the happy dance. Lovely derps!!! 🥰🥰
Aw, what clever pups.  I love labs so much. Big ol' goofballs
good boy Did you encourage them?
This makes me so happy!  Haha!
Phew.. that was definitely a job for two good boys/girls.
OK that is really precious
One of my dogs does this. We will throw the stick until it is (and I kid you not) .5” in length. And she brings it back until she’s chomped it all away and then the game starts over. We don’t deserve dogs.
This video made my exhausting day! Thank you!!!
And just like that Reddit totally redeems itself
I have a Labrador, and it truly scares me how their body can handle being hyper and happy 24/7. I think a human body will stress out from it. It’s just too much.
I can't take it. The happiness is too much!!!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Lumber Shortage... The struggle is real!!!
I'm over here hoping it doesn't fall through a crack in the deck when they throw it. I wouldn't be able to handle the heartache.
Show her take it to her.  Mom mom look at what we found it's a stick a tiny stick I'm so excited mom.   Lol cuties
That reaction, When teacher asked a question and you know the answer....☺☺☺☺☺☺☺
Look at that big stick! Good dogs!
Aww those tappy toes 🥺
Well did you throw it for them?
This is the most aww gif I've ever seen. I'm swooning.
Stick is good, but it could be fire
It's still a stick just throw it and stop being all judgy
❤❤❤
This just made my day.
Shtick
Sweet babies 😭😭💜🥺💜
That dance the white dog does just gets me right in the feels.
I just love labs, the dumb sweat hearts of dog breeds
It’s not the size of the stick it’s how you toss it!
Awww my heart needed this so much right now
“We haz a stik!”
It’s fetch man. They want you to throw that thing.
The priceless gift from their hearts!!
These are desperate times
This is honestly one of the greatest videos I've ever seen :)
SurfSurfy
The fact there’s no sound is a crime against humanity.
The best
They have a watch over the small stuff
*Opens free award*

Take it! Take it all!
This is so freakin adorable. It made my night.
O.m.g. so adorable!!❤
Oh my that is absolutley hilarious!!!

Dogs drool
“Hey, hey! Ok, man, now they’re looking...SHOW THEM THIS BRANCH WE FOUND!!!”
We don’t deserve dogs
This is adorable
I've watched this many, many times. I sent it to my wife and fam. Thanks for the smile and laugh.
And they should be
Yellow lab be like, Sho em Sho em Sho em!!!
Somehow that stick has the owner's scent and they brought it back... cause, must bring back THE stick
They want to play fetch 😂
Too, too cute.

It’s time for you to take your dogs to the park or out for a walk. Preferably in the woods.
You could almost think these guys are trolling and think they are the funniest dogs around from the way they happy dance.
Tippy taps!
So nice to see size dont matter in the K9 world.
We don’t deserve doggos
The blond lab's little hops remind me of Andre Agassi receiving serve.
i can saw my tinder on it
Butta dog, dog wit da butta
Stick is stick!
Well, this is the cutest fucking thing I’ve seen all day.
How cuuute
Genuine awesome wholesomeness!!
I was having a really bad week but man this made feel so happy, Thanks OP.
I came. I SAW. I WOOFED.
Omg that wiggle is everything! He is vibrating lol
gtfo rn i’m sobbing 😭😭😭
I'm proud of them
Very good doggos :D
These beauts just remind me of Quest for Fire. An awesome movie.
So Cute!!!
Awhe!!!
Dude he’s gonna love this, check this out human! Isn’t it AWESOME!?
That’s so funny
My chocolate lab does this too 😂 And then gets mad when I throw it and he can’t find it. Like dude, what’d you expect? Go find a ball.
Translation; Your labs are back and they look really good. But we need you to stick around a little while.
So cute!!!
Was that a dried up worm?  My dogs get all crazy with dried up worms.  They roll around on top of them an rub their necks with the worms like they are putting on perfume.
I think my dog is broken, he’s never once brought me a stick… of any size
Idiot dog ❤️
Awwwww
Good to see that size doesn’t matter
Elite Tippy Tappies
Good... now break it.
That is just adorable. I love how the yellow encourages the black to bring it in. Helping !!
LOL
My mom's GSD does this!! He'll usually bring you a small piece of mulch and insist you throw it for him, and about 90% of the time he'll find it which really impresses me
Hahaha these two knuckleheads!! I love it! Dogs are so amazingly dumb and sweetly brilliant all in one fell swoop. So great!
102k and counting! Wow
This is why I love dogs
Now throw.
Holy crap this is adorable
That black dog looks like an older version of my dog Gary.
That is gold :)
Aww shit the yellow and black combo
Damn I miss having a dog.
That is a sign of a very well kept property
Omg the little tap dance at the end ! So precious
It ain’t much but it’s honest work
So darn cute!
