I’m sorry but that is not “your” bed. Definitely all his.
Me watching this video: “It’s not *unmade,* it’s just a little wrink— oh.”
He seems so deliberate. Fuck this bed and fuck this comforter. 😂
What were the other suspects? Ghosts? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
At first I was thinking "oh that's nothing...". Then I waited a bit more and was like "oh...".
[deleted]
Yeah you need that momma cat that makes the bed.
If you put it in reverse, it's just a video of a good boy/girl making her owners bed xD
So you have a playful dog, a squeeky rubber duck and you still were wondering if Goldilocks came visiting your bed?
I like the multiple pauses where doggo looks to the door and completely pauses in an innocent stance, like they are ready for op to come in to the room so they can put on an act of innocence. “Idk how bed got untucked, I was napping and wake up like this!”
fuckkkk yooo couchhhh
When you're in my room, you're always being filmed
My old German would do the same to the rugs after vacuuming, too. Lost her a few weeks ago, but on the the bright side, the rugs look nice. Man, I miss her
I’d imagine “my husky” is the answer to most unsolved questions a person has when they own a husky.
You should post this on r/animalsbeingjerks
***Your*** bed?
Oh, dogs. I love those goofballs.
Somebody needs to go for a walk
Our female German Shepherd is notorious for unmaking beds. She just HAS to make a nest out of all the blankets and wiggle under them. She likes to fight her brother from under them. We just don't bother anymore.

Our in-laws couldn't figure out how their bed was getting messed up when they babysat her. They finally caught her in the act and told us about it one day, they were shocked it was her because she's normally the well behaved one.

I was just like, yeah...she does that. Good luck.
You couldn't figure out how your bed became messy with a hyper dog running about the house? 🤔
I fucking love dogs so much
This rides the line between awww and r/animalsbeingjerks
It's nice at least that he has no problem entertaining himself while you're gone!
We stopped making our bed because our dogs did this every time.  They have both passed away, and I still don't make the bed. 🤷🏼‍♀️
Morning zoomies!
That is a "living his best life" moment if I have EVER seen one!
Where's part two? Want to keep laughing?!
Soldier, that bed wasn't made at the start of the video!
omg I laughed so loud. it's been a long time since an internet video did that. 

When you dog started just ripping the comforter off I lost it. xD
Dog
This made my day.💗
This made me smile so hard. Thank you for that
What a spaz, lol.  Is he running cat.exe there?
OMG that was so funny.  Thank you for this.
Thank you for the smiles!
God I love zoomies
Lol, My dog does this everyday until he gets all the sheets off… ughh
Haha! My dog does that all the time. I've given up making my bed at this point
This may be the best thing I see all weekend.
Aww!!!he is adorable!my cat does the same when we aren't around to two stuffed toy dogs he does not like.
My dog also does this to a made bed. 

Why do they scrunch up the duvet? Anyone know?
Ha. One of my collies does that, she has to dig herself a nice nest.
More like r/awwhellnaw
my dog thinks made beds are a goddamn playground/racetrack

There's an entire house! Why does this one tiny portion of real estate excite the dog so much??? Only when it's tidied up?!?!?
Zoomies on da bed
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Freedooooommmmm!
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)How adorable ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Illegally precious pupper
Your dog be like "fuck this bed"
This is hilarious lol.  What a rascal lol.
Haha, that dog is very lively.
Did you figure out how to stop it? My girl does this at least twice a day. But I hate having an unmade bed, so it has to be tidied up.
This is amazing
I was like that’s not really unmade… halfway into it, oh now it is!
Dog has to doggy
Um, that's the dog's bed now. 😆
I've never seen so many people try to psychoanalyze a post's title
You needed a camera to figure out that the dog you left at home was responsible?
OP, clearly you need to take your puppy out to play at the park more often. 🤣
Sounds like the dog is smarter than OP if they needed a camera to figure this out. How could this have happened? HOW???
I’m laughing so hard. 😂😂😂
I mean seems pretty fucking obvious if you own a dog.
I never would have guessed what was undoing my bed. Never ever.
![gif](giphy|Mous21IAhJQiI)
I envy this dogs level of energy and over all joy. Adorable!
That’s  hilarious!
Our pup used to have bed freak out time every day. On his own he would jump up on our bed, roll around, do a few spins, let out a bark and a few yelps, jump off and go back to the living room. He did this every day for years until he got too old to jump up on the bed.
My crazy Siberian Husky used to do that to my bed all of the time! I miss that wacky pup.
I kept having that same problem until I found my dog under the comforter one day!
Fuck yo couch!
This dog is the [Rick James](https://youtu.be/EGwMiSIP-go) of beds
So cute.
Owning a dog might have been the first clue.
You have a dog and you can’t figure out how your bed is getting messed up? OK…
This belongs in r/animalsbeingderps 

Also I was today years old when I learned that people outside of the military still make their beds each morning. I admire this but I’m far too lazy. Especially before coffee.
If you had just remembered you have a dog you would’ve saved money on the camera
Lol any person who has a pet in their house has no allowance to say mysterious stuff like "couldn't figure out how"
Take the dog outside and let it run for a while it looks bored lol
How do you have a dog and not figure this out? I feel bad for the dog if your critical thinking skills are this absent. But you're probably really nice!
He smells you on the bed, he must really love you!
What an awesome dog! So happy
My girl does the same thing lol
We don’t deserve these awesome creatures
This is why I couldn't have a dog! (Come at me) yes I am a cat person
How do people have dogs on their bed? Doesn’t the hair get everywhere?
Yay dogsmell in the sheets. So cute!
Living their best life
Early morning Zoomies are the best
What a psycho! Love him
"That's not how you make a bed.... THAT is how you make a bed!" --The Dog
Really ? You had no idea ?
Maybe walk your dog if you don’t want it to go this crazy, the lose their mind when you keep them in a cage for too long
Thank you for the laugh. We have a “fluffer”, too.
I love when our dog does this lol 😂 we call it the Zoomies
Mans gon craaaaazy
Animals are the best…
Should teach pets to stay away from bed rooms.
Had no idea, huh?
Love this!
Now thats a happy dog!
❤️
She knows exactly what she's doing; Grabs the squeaky toy, jumps on the bed, squeaks, *looks back at door to check its clear*, and then goes nuts lol
My dog as a pup was always like that and one day I came back from work with a hole digged in my mattress. That day I've learn about how my mattress is made!
You have a dog and this didn't occur to you?
You have a big ass dog but couldn’t figure out why your bed was being unmade. Fucking ghosts dude 🙄
Wow, someone who actually makes their bed.
You have a dog but can't figure out without camera how stuff is moving in your house when you are not here? 

Well . . .
You have a Husky in your house and could not figure out how your bed was magically being unmade? rrrrrrright.
Really, you couldn't figure it out without a camera? Right...
We had a dog that did this whenever my at-the-time girlfriend was on her period.
Did you forget you had a dog?
Bed Zoomies.
Insane zoomies i see!!
So you own a dog and never once thought that your dog could’ve been responsible for why your bed was unmade?? 🧐🧐
You have a ghost in your room
I have a giant ass dog and I can't figure out what's happened to my bed
yeah,, that's why you have a video camera set up in your bedroom ;)
When you live with someone else you get used to things moving by themselves
The dog "Lookit me. I'm hooman."
You couldn’t figure that out without a camera???
Fuck yo couch!
So you have a dog and you needed a camera to figure out why your bed getting unmade?
You are not the brightest no offense
/cue scene of Kronk sneaking and humming his own theme music around the city taking Kuzco's body to dump
Has big hyper doggo but thinks, "I can't imagine how my bed gets unmade? Must be that Steve guy from across the hall. That Steve..."
So it really didn’t occur to you that it was the dog?
That is one happy dog.
"hon, I swear.  I put up the camera to catch the dog.  The video of us that it happened to catch last night was just a coincidence."

"OMG, yes.  Of course I deleted it and totally don't have a copy on my phone."
Omg how can you even be mad at him when what he’s doing is so adorable. Need to go pet my pups now.
Lives with a tornado, and couldn't figure it out until video evidence.
You couldn't figure that one out without a camera... Okay Sherlock
You didn’t notice this jungle animal tearing through your house ?? Lol hears him going absolutely nuts, you walk in to your room, “how in the seven hells”!
Wow, your dog’s a spaz.  Who wuda thunk?
You needed a camera to figure that out???
You knew.
One of my dogs does the exact same thing. When she was a puppy, we would find all the sheets and blanket in a ball in the middle of the bed. She's 12 years old now, but still spins on the bed like the dog in the video.
this reminds me of the time I was sat outside at a friends house and out of the corner of my eye I saw her three dogs just straight up using her bed as a trampoline
He was framed and anyone who disagrees should be arrested
You knew, you just wanted to see it
"Omg how does my bed keep getting unmade? I mean, the only thing in my place is big ass dog. What could it be? Just can't figure it out."
You have a big goofy dog and you needed a camera to figure it out? Aaaaahahahahaha
You needed a camera to figure this out? What were your other possible explanations? I'd love to know.
“And while I’m at it, fuck your sheets”
The hairs didn’t give it away?
That's not a bed that's a wood box with a blanket on it.  I didn't see it sink in even the slightest bit.  Is your sleep number 9000?
My dog does this exact same thing, only right before I want to go to sleep.
I'm sure that was a real mystery.
LOL! What a big goofball!!
Pup: “I will NOT be ignored!”
That’s too funny! My dachshund does that, pulling the covers/toys/pillows under himself. Drives my husband nuts trying to figure out what he’s trying to do! 🤣🤣🤣
Well, he certainly knows how to keep himself entertained!
This made my day.
Couldn’t figure it out? You own a dog.
How could you not figure this out without a camera?
What else could it possibly have been?
Owns a dog. Hears noises. Yet pretends to not know what’s causing it. Oh fuck off
You couldn’t? Like, no inkling whatsoever?
Cute, but curious why you needed a camera seems pretty evident the cause.
You have a dog and you couldn’t figure out how this was happening?
Ummm.  You live with a dog. It’s the dog, if it’s not you.
Only suckers make their bed everyday
Me: in kitchen, making coffee

Dog: not in kitchen

*eyes narrow suspiciously*

They’re like toddlers. When they are unseen and you can’t hear them, something is going awry!
OP: *Has spastic dog*
Also OP: “How does my bed get unmade?”
You had to put up a camera to realize your dog was messing up your bed? 

Or did you not know you had a dog?
You have a massive dog with a squeaky toy. I mean.. not hard to figure out. The step in your bedroom is more disconcerting.
Zoomie boi 😍
Wait wait you have a dog and its crates in your bedroom and you couldnt figure this out without a camera? O.K then
OP u have a giant dog and u had to install cameras to figure out who was doing it?!
"I couldn't figure out how my bed kept getting unmade"

Owns a dog.
you really couldn't figure out it was the dog?
Dollars to donuts you knew exactly how your bed was getting unmade...
The only way I wouldn't instantly guess it was the dog without the camera is if you have no dog and this one sort of just breaks in every day without your knowledge.
I bet I would have figured it out even without the camera.
You have a German Shepard and you couldn’t figure it out?  I haven’t seen my remote in days, but I have a two year old. Mystery solved
You own a huge, hyper dog and couldn't figure that out? sus
Couldn't figure it out eh? You wouldn't lie to us now would you?
you have a dog, and a bed with dog hair on it, and you couldn’t figure it out without a camera? sigh…….
The intentional disrespect…
Did a damn fine job unmaking that bed
Veri active boi
Horror movie freebie the dog toy comes too life or just give the dog some thc not much but yeah guilty ..ever see a dog make an oh shit expression?
You make your bed? 😂
This reminds me of Rick James on Charlie Murphy’s couch. 🤣
That was the cutest thing!
I don't think I've ever enjoyed a bed as much as this dog.
Someone had the morning zoomies and wanted to nest.
I mean, if you have a sizable dog, shoudln't that already be assumed?
Ye sure...that's why you put that camera there
My dogs did the same, they love messing up a bed.
OP = “Phew… no ghost here!”
Your dog done gots the zoomies! 

Super cute
So my puppy is 20 lbs and messes the bed up from the pillow side, otherwise it’s identical
**It was indeed the last time the bed was ever made again.**
First time I’ve laughed today, I needed it, thanks for sharing
This made my day
Loved this! Thank you for sharing - how playful.
You have a very nice home
Such a happy looking pup! My Aussie does the weird nest making thing with my blankets and it cracks me up!
That is so fucking cute.
You really couldn’t figure that out without a camera?
You needed a camera to figure out your dog was doing this?
Just throwing it out there OP, it's only a matter of time before your dog puts holes in your comforter/sheets.  I used to let my dogs play like this too until my nice sheets had a big hole in them from his paws.
**has a giant fluffy playful dog in the house**

“How does my bed keep getting un-made?!”




Edit: just realized that two asterisks before and after a sentence **makes it bold!**
OP's first step was to put up a cross. When that didn't stop the demon, then they put up the camera.
Raised by Huskies? Lol
Did you steal my dog? He does the same thing!
 😂😂😂😂
What a goofball, I love it!
Where’s part 2
This is too funny they just be like that sometimes!! That’s that GERMAN SHEPHERD ENERGY!!
What a good boy
I think this is a software issue, it looks like some cat drivers are installed...

This is so effing cute, pre bed zoomies are the best!
Username brothers!
Your pup: I AM SO HAPPY THAT YOU ARE AWAKE!!
Huskies are crazy.
Part 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/th0ckb/part_2_of_my_pup_unmaking_my_bed_oc
I want to see a video where the owner talks to the dog through the camera mid bed bounce.
You have a dog and you couldn't figure out that the dog was doing it without a camera..? Did you think someone snuck in your window?
Oh no. Our 8 month Golden doesn't realize he is big enough to jump on the bed. This is a glimpse in to my future.
Bad dog
My doggo does this whenever I get up from bed to do something. She drags all the sheets around her to form a nest. I should get this on camera 😊
I have two who love to sleep in my nice white sheets... they pull the covers down from the top, climb between the sheets, often with a muddy toy or two, and pull the covers over themselves.  They especially like to do it after a romp and a dip in the pool, so they are wet and covered with sand.   I am trying to invent something to stop them!  Bad Girls!
You need the cat that remakes your bed.
That dog needs to go to the park if it’s that energetic in a house
This is my favourite video 😍
Wtf is he so excited about, that’s what I wanna know
Is he fighting a ghost?
My dog does the same thing, except he has the audacity of doing that while I’m still laying in bed
I was like “oh he’s not doing that bad, he’s being sorta careful… ooooh well ok then…!” 😂
How do you not know you have a dog?!?
You never thought that the dog did it?
Doggo with +8 to chaotic household tendencies
So happy
This is the dorkiest dog I’ve ever seen
cmon thats not that bad... Oh no. That dogs way too brainy.
Your dog clearly prefers an unmade so if you could just stop making it every morning that would be great for the dog. Thank you.
Idk if it’s enough to convict him tbh
r/Zoomies
Shepherds and huskies are alike in so many characteristically ways
It’s like watching a squirrel trapped in a dog’s body. 😂
But isn’t this why you make it?
A dog enjoying life! Nothing better.
Such a good puppy 🤣🤣🤣🤣
THIS WILL NOT DO!! I will unmaketh this unholy endeavor and return the royal resting place to its natural state!!
I'm outta the crate. Whoo hoo!!!
Secret agent dog
Morning dog friskiness happens every time!!!🤣
Unless the poorly trained dog isn't yours I'm not sure why you couldn't figure it out without the camera.
Your house look like a typical set to a horror movie
hmmm yes i can see how there would be confusion, the bed could have been messing itself up
You knew...you just wanted to show the video.
I once had a housemate that slept through our house getting robbed but if you can’t figure out why you’re bed isnt made without a camera, you have him beat.
You have a dog. You couldn't work this out?
Really? You couldn’t have guessed your dog unmade your bed? I don’t believe you. It’s the most logical conclusion that your dog would mess your bed up. Look at that thing.
Oh, come now! You have a mess and a dog and you didn't put mess and dog together?
Wow, you have a dog, and you couldn't figure it out until you installed a camera. 

Who knew, such a surprise
You have a dog… and really couldn’t figure this out without a camera? 👍🏼
You couldn't figure it out?? What was your first guess?
You couldn’t figure out it was the dog?
You have a giant dog and you never thought to think your dog was doing it? Lol
Dog hair all over it didn’t give it away?
You own a dog and you really couldn't figure this out?
what do u mean you couldnt figure it out, you have a big ass playful dog but you thought ghosts went paranormal activity 3 on your bed ?
“You couldn’t figure it out” - yeah sure
"Couldn't" figure it out.
Couldn’t figure that out, huh?
So, you never realized you have a large, energetic dog in your house?
You have a dog. How was there ever a moment when you needed to 'figure out' how your bed was getting messed up? Like you thought there was a ghost and then you set up the camera and suddenly remembered you had a dog that has access to the bed?
"Couldn't figure out how my bed was getting unmade"

Literally owns a dog.
How many times are you gonna post this today?   Shows that you've posted it four times already.
pro tip: close the door
Oh really? You have a huge dog but you “couldn’t figure out” that big mystery? Yeah ok.
It took putting up a camera for you to deduce it was your dog? Wow.
But the dog hair on it wasn’t the give away.  Lol
You have a dog and it was a mystery? *eyeroll*
"Part 1" 

yea pls don't bring this shitty tiktok clickbait meta to reddit
Aww?

More like: Aww man, really?
How does someone who has had Huskies know it's your first husky? This video. 

We all learned the hard way. That's normal. They are forces of nature. 

I miss my Mani-Nana so much. That dog was oke of the great loves of my life. Sniff 8 years and my heart still hurts when I think about those twelve magical years. 

It hurts, but I would not trade a moment of my time with that lady.
This is really funny, but I mean, you have a dog that size and you “couldn’t figure out” why it was getting unmade? Common, that would’ve been your first guess.
FUCK THIS CORNER IN PARTICULAR
Very cute, but you knew.
Cute and all, but if you couldn't figure this out without a camera you shouldn't be in charge of another living thing.
You have a crazy canine and you didn't immediately assume it was the dog? Unless you have some paranormal activity going on in that bedroom of yours, I feel like the dog should have been the first guess. Lol
so cuuute
>redditor for 1 day

I kinda smell the bull**** comin from that account already.

You got a dog and you really wanna tell us that you're surprised how your bed becomes a mess? And obviously you only found out after you put up a camera what it COULD have been? Oh boy.

What you gonna use the account for? Selling it? Or using it to sell us something? Just get it out and tell us what it is...
Eww gross, imagine all the dog hair all over that bed and the nasty dog smell. How can you sleep?
First time owning a dog? Lol
You own a dog and couldn't figure it out?
ITT: HoW cOuLd YoU nOt KnOw It WaS tHe DoG‽

Me: aww, look at that goofball doing zoomies 😍
….. was the other suspect a ghost?….
Does the bed, but it keeps getting undone, even though it's the person's home and he has a pet...

*jEsUs ChRisT I wOnDeR iF tHeRe'S GhOsTs iN tHiS hOuSe...* Yeah, sure, what could it be...
Really? You have a dog that you always free roam of the house and into your bed... and you couldn't figure it out? Seriously?
People that let their animals in their bed.  Man I dunno how y'all do it.  It's fucking gross.
"hmmm how could this keep happening? Surely it could not be the large animal that lives in my home and I let run around during the day...no it must be something else. I'll put up a camera"

Honestly what do you mean you couldn't figure this out lmao
We don’t deserve these pets man
Has a full grown dog but doesn't know why house smells
Sport laying
The weirdest part is OP doesn’t even have a dog
and you didn't hear the squeaking?
Doggo zoomies in morning. It’s not unmade it has the the dogs personal flair to it.
So you have a big ass dog running around but didn’t know how your bed got messed up?
The fact you had to put up a camera to “figure out “ who’s messing the bed  says a lot about your critical thinking skills  or lack there of
Really. Couldn't figure it out huh?, Have a feeling the dogs the smart one in the house![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
Really? That wasn’t your immediate guess?
Wait! You have a large dog and you did not know? Did you put a camera to make sure it was not a ghost that did it? Where you disappointed? I know I would.
So you have a hyper dog, and couldn't figure out why your bed was getting unmade while your dog went to play in the room while you made coffee?
Just upload the video of your dog messing up your bed instead of acting like you didn't know what was happening?
You have a dog and you couldn't figure out it's the dog that did that? Not that sharp you are.
He’s ADORABLE!  I want to nurture joy in my life (and Everyone’s joy and I’ve vowed not to watch tv, but to pray for PEACE IN THE WORLD!🙏🙏🙏🙏
Looks like you need to walk your dog or take him somewhere to get some of that energy out
Hahahhahaha. Advice, walk that dog more
I think the dog might just be cooped up.

Do you take it out enough? It's a big dog, it needs to be active A LOT or it develops behavior problems..
Is the camera going to be pointing at the bed always now? Wondering if it'll record _other_ doggy too 😂
Great detective work
I once had a housemate that slept through our house getting robbed but if you can’t figure out why you’re bed isnt made without a camera, you have him beat.
Deductive reasoning skills - 0
Maybe try walking him. He's full of this crazy energy because he's not getting his primal dog needs fulfilled.  

"my dog has the zoomies" is code for 'I don't walk my dog, he has a big yard and I take him to dog park once a week"
That what happens when you put a dog in a cage. You need to take him for more walks. An animal is not just something you can store in a cage when you want to.
So no one is gonna address the fact that this person just has a bedroom camera?.....
Disgusting and dog owners wonder why they stink all the time
Huskies are secretly just cats in a dogs body…
I don't understand why you need the cage.  
Edit: It was a joke. I'm willing to bet he sleeps there at night.
You really didn't know it was your dog? Are you dumb?

*sees crucifix*

Ah ok. You are dumb.
Walk your dog, don't be one of those negligent owners
That was really funny to watch. 

By the way. Don't make your beds! At least not to shortly after you get up. If you cover your still warm bed with your blanket you a creating a prefect environment for bed bugs and all other types of nasty creatures.
Umm like how many people are living with you lol

If it’s just you and the dog then that narrows it down
*Hurr Durr look at me i'm hooman, don't do this, don't pee there, don't chew that*
😂😂😍 so gorgeous
Oh man, that is so me when I’m looking for my keys.
Unmaking the bed was like an after thought of excitement after his toy fell on the ground. 

Reminds me of when my cat gets the zoomies 🐈💨
He looks like a happy doggo
😳😂😂😂😂
dude, leave him alone, he just wants to play.
You've got a husky, and you couldn't figure it out?  I'm reporting this as a troll post. /s
I’m impressed that you make the bed before coffee.
I read the post title, and thought "Its got to be a dog" before the animal ran into the room.
Being gaslit by the dog. “Bed? Who made the bed? Surely not you, just look at it!!”
😆
Somebody's got the zoomies
Hey Farva, what’s that place called, you like to eat at with all the stuff on the walls?
This gave off, "Dog is not allowed on the bed so he's taking full opportunity when he can" vibes.
Lol
Doggo being derp caught in 4k
haha, hyper doggie
You'd think the fur would give it away
My silver lab will get up on my side of the bed and roll around every day….kicks my pillows off the bed and everything….I think she just likes my smells
What a lovable little goofball
Funny
This is so cute
Zoomies are the best
My dog does this and ;-;
Zoomies on your bed
Hahaha, so cute
My pupper does the same shit lol
r/zoomies
My dog does circles around the bed like the Daytona 500. The cover ends up in a ball in the corner.
awwwwww hehe he has the zoomies
Somehow this was exactly what I expected to see.
What do you mean you couldn’t figure out how your bed kept getting unmade?? Lol
So this was your first clue? Smart dog!
That's a good, happy boye right there :)
The dog is hilarious!!
How happy he/she is
You really couldnt figure it out huh?
#tri- THAT’S HER FEET
He fixed it for you.
"OK, all done here. Oh wait! I almost forgot!"
You didn't expect this? Lmao
+100 drift points for those 180s.
"hmm my bed always gets unmade when I make tea... And it always happens when my big dog runs into my room with his toy and starts squealing it... What could possibly be causing this?"
See what happened was…..😂😂😂
You have a dog and didn't think that maybe the dog did it?
My dog does this so much
I think the doggo has some excess energy to let out. Just curious... Do you keep him in that cage every night?
I think your friend is making the bed. For him.
No, this is NOT your dog. This is obviously a doppelganger impersonating your dog and messing up your bed every morning.

Your actual dog was downstairs waiting for breakfast.
What else did you consider? 😂
what da dog doin?
Your dog is hilarious. I love how he's like okay that's good enough and jumps down... Naw I'M GETTIN IT!
You have a husky and you never suspected that ADHD of a dog to have done it so much that you mounted a camera? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
really ? , you couldn't figure out that your hyper dog was messing up your bed?
And I thought my dog was bad about unmaking the bed! 🤣🤣
wow
Sounds like somebody takes the dog out before making coffee.
has dog. wonders how bed gets messed up. 

Cap
The solution also seems to be in the picture.
Omg too cute !!!
Pretty slow on the uptake if you have a dog that has free entry into your bedroom and you wonder why your bed is getting unmade.
I feel like the dog would have been the obvious guess to begin with.
Oh my god this is so cute. I'd be annoyed if it was my bed but cute doggo is very hard to get mad at.
I love this dog!
Now that is a naughty boy ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
Mmmm... Fresh, clean sheets!
Will to live: rising.
I love him
Now you also know why the cat is full of holes.
The dog would instantly be my nr. 1 suspect.
he misses u
Oh hell yeah without footage I would have for sure thought it was ghosts! Silly pupperoni!!
Hahahaha that's really crazy . I think he will make the bed crazy everytime you out of the room
Aww he just wants to sleep on the bed.
Love this!
Seeing as this was done by a German shepherd, I can say with confidence that that was intentional.
Couldn't figure it out huh?
That’s why I’m a dog person🤔
Oh you had no idea
We demand the sequel
Oof. Every time my kid asks for a dog, I think of ending up with this….exhausting non-stop energy.
Total Froob.
My dog does the same, they want to be in your scent.
Pretty cool, the behaviour seems Fox Like to me, but idk....
This is the explanation we wanted otherwise Reddit was going to end up saving you from carbon monoxide poisoning
Omg mine does this too! We call them circle zoomies lol
😍😍
Hmm, it’s either poltergeists or my hyperactive dog…I wonder which?
Precious rotten doggo :)

As someone with a dog, how could you not figure out what was happening without a camera??
Yeah dog probably would've been my guess, no camera needed.
Admit it, you just wanted to buy that camera that you couldn’t justify buying
Fuck yo couch nikka
I mean the dog crate should have been your first clue…
Looks like me, sounds like me, but not me hooman
The devil in the flesh 🤣
You didn’t notice the hairs?
Oh my god, this is exactly what my good boy at home does (only it takes way more effort from him as he weighs only 5kg) 

And also pretends like nothing happened.
'It was Duckie; Duckie did it all.  I saws himb.
He's literally purposely being mischievous
Hard to believe you didn’t notice a 100lb dog living in your house, but if you didn’t, I can’t blame you.
Fun video and nice to have confirmation but ... based upon the energy exhibited here, something tells me you had a pretty good idea how your bed kept getting unmade.
Mr has found a new game
Animals being adorably cute jerks
This is fantastic. Bit of a tearjerker for me, I had forgotten my buddy would do this, he liked to ball up our throw blankets
I just couldn't figure it out...
90lbs of zoomies will do that
HOLY SHIT HE IS SO FAST YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM HOW FAST HE IS
You have a dog and thought it was ghosts ?
So cute.
Mine does the exact same thing. Loves to pull all the blankets into a pile and lay on it. Every damn day
This makes me so happy! ZOOMIES!
Ohhh those are like the zoomies my Shiba gets. Absolute maniac!
I think they drank your coffee too
You didn't think about your person-sized dog being responsable ?
Now there's a happy dog. 10/10 would remake bed again.
You have a pet and couldn't figure out why your bed kept getting messed up? 😂
Prolly should get your dog checked out
*lives with dag* "whO keeps uNMakInG mY BeD?!"
Not gonna lie, he had us in the first half!
If you're in my room, you're always being filmed
Reminds me of my brother in laws St Bernard that was not allowed on the couch but each morning, the couch had a warm spot about the same size as the dog.
Where'd my toy go? Where is it? Under here? Here maybe?! Where!!!???
you have a hyperactive dog and you had to set up a camera to figure this out? i’m worried about you
You really didn't know? Not the slightest idea considering you have a dog? Really?
Yeah, no, I don't think we need a part two.
Strange you couldn’t figure it out.. what did you think it was a ghost? You have a dog.
My German Shepherd mix runs like that too on my bed! Lucky for him I never make my bed
You had to put a camera to figure it out? Hehehe
A) 0:34 starts action


B) 0:00 starts superbly cute


C) Fake fake fake. OP for sure knew how their bed was getting undone ;-)
I mean, I guess I have to ask - that's your dog, right?
Whoah! Are you Columbo?
Mother fucker!
What’s his little toy suppose to be? Is it just a faceless/limbless fluffy thing with a tail?
Should've been able to easily figure it out by all the dog hair.
Someone has been getting into the catnip again.
Couldn't bounce a quarter on it but you can bounce a pup!
All that fur wasn’t a hint?
Our Great Dane does the exact same thing. He gets morning and evening zoomies. I have to lock my bedroom door now or live with constant paw prints on my sheets.

Dear lord, WHERE’S PART 2???
Image. You think your house is haunted and the ghost only messes the sheets on your bed up.
Shepsky?
r/zoomies material if it exists?
Our boxer does something similar, except he knocks all the pillows off the bed lol
Oh you little bastard XD
Huskeys are just giant rodents.
Sign of a happy puppy! This happens in my home every-single-day lol
Maybe he’s trying to reverse engineer the owner back to bed
Couldn’t figure it out? Wouldn’t it either be your dog or a ghost? I’d probably go with dog.
Rambunctious dog owner can’t figure out how their bed is getting messed up.
My cats just started doing this
look, i'm completely broken inside... can you send me a longer video of this wonderfulness?
This kills me, my dog does the exact same thing. Our dog has severe separation anxiety and loses her mind when we leave even for an hour. She destroys everything, so when we need to leave, even for a few hours, we have our spare bedroom that she goes in.

We put a camera in there because we were just curious what she does, and it’s almost identical to this. Girl has legit shook a toy so hard against the wall that I had to fix the drywall. She gets HOURS upon HOURS of exercise every day, but when we leave, she doesn’t know how to properly use her energy. I can’t get mad though, it’s clearly separation anxiety (which she is also medicated for, and it helps a little) but damn does she go nuts in that spare bedroom.
My dog does this with the covers when he's really amped up *or* absolutely fuming livid.
What an a*hole!!
You have a big energetic dog and you needed a camera to figure this out.. not the sharpest tool in the shed are ya
Really? You couldn’t figure it out? What was the guess? Ghosts? Mini earthquakes solely in the bedroom?
That crucifix moved
Sipping in my hot coffee while watching the video of my bed getting rekt
"Couldnt figure it out"

![gif](giphy|9DJtFRgk0tOla)
Couldn't figure it out - you thought it was a ghost or something?
Hahahahaha I think this would qualify for the sub animals being jerks.  Hahahahahha
I like how they went to leave and then came back like "oh yeah, I forgot what came in here for" *tears up the bed*
You have a dog. How could you not put two and two together
At least someone had fun lol
You needed a camera to figure it out? Really?
“I couldn’t figure it out!!!” Either click bait title or total moron op.
You have a dog and couldn't figure it out, mhhh
Ah yeah I couldnt figure out how my bed kept getting undone from the bottom.. how else would that occur.
I don't believe you that you didn't know
/r/animalsbeingderps
You couldn't figure it out? How many people/animals live in the house? What was your first thought?
Guessing all the dog hair on the sheets didn’t give it away.
What actually goes through a dog's mind.
Madness I tell ye'.
Why do you video your bed?
You mean you couldn't figure that one out by simple deduction?
Wait! You have a big dog that is loose in the house and were unaware how your bed was getting messed up?

GTFOH
Really? You couldn’t figure it out? And you live with a large dog in the room?

the virgin making your bed vs the CHAD going to bed with absolutely no preparation
I thought it was definitely ghosts, but then I remembered I have a dog.
My sweet pup use to do this. He crossed the rainbow bridge 2 years ago… thank you for some sweet memories!
OP: *has husky*

Also OP: “I wonder why it looks like I have a toddler?”
Well played OP, excellent title bait. Redditors are drawn to the any chance to show off their intellectual superiority, like moths to a flame.
Me watching this video: “How ignorant do you have to be to not know that your dog is messing up your bed?”
>I couldn't figure out how my bed kept getting unmade while I was making coffee

you can't be serious right?
Anyone with a dog knows what the fuck is up when their bed is not how they left it.
Some real Monk investigating there.
Thank you for that giggle.
Is this an elkhound?
My cat rips the covers off me when he wants breakfast
What a lil’ rascal >:)
What a lie What about hairs u never saw em.
My dog has a habit of going digging when he jumps on my bed. Pretty sure he thinks there are bones buried in the mattress, the daft git.
What a dick bag
Who did you think it was, ghosts?
So you have a dog…. And you couldn’t figure out how the bed was getting messed up!?…. Should you be in charge of another living thing?
Will, sir you have an animal inside. That would explain it easy
that is a happy doggy ! !
Has pet: cant workout how bed gets mess up
What an absolutely criminal baby.
I live alone. I have a dog ☕️🤫🤥
It wasn't me 🎶 (Shaggy)
My dog did that too. Sometimes the blankets all ended up in the living room. Funny guy!
Our Fox Terrier flicks the pillows off the bed.
The dog of chaos
OP forgot they have a dog
You have a dog and you „could not figure it out“…………….
Side note that’s a cool ceiling
Keeping a bed made is overrated lol
“He’ll never know.”
You could not figure it out? Knowing you have a large dog, what were the other possibilities?
With having dogs most of my adult life...I haven't had a made up bed since 1980.
How much fun is that! Are you going to continue to allow this?
Oh my goodness I LOVE him/her. That’s the cutest thing ever
You couldn't figure it out, huh?  


Really?
Happy happy dog❤️❤️
You live with an energetic giant animal and couldn’t come to the conclusion that if you weren’t in the room to mess it up it must have done it?
Precious 💗
people have dogs and then they write "I couldn't figure out how". Really?
Even before I clicked I knew it had to be a germy
Morning zooooomies
What a little psycho!!! Love it!!
OP your room looks so quaint and cozy
Getting unmade sounds like it disintegrated
You needed a camera to figure this out?
Dude has a dog and still couldn’t figure out how? Pretty sure he knows his dog is used to going on the bed. But anything for internet points in guess.
Can’t figure out why the bed I made is unmade
I own a dog and all the doors are unlocked. 
But it’s a mistery
Hi
Hahahaha what a trouble maker. This made my morning.
Couldn't figure that out huh?
Couldn't figure that out without a camera? Yeah. Okay.
The blanket of dog hair wasn’t a clue?
Terrifying scene from the new non-horror reboot “Completely-normal Activity”
You couldn’t assume it was the dog? Nice logic in your brain 👍👍
HOLLERING!!’ LOL
haha that's adorable
Пёс на кровати- дикость и невоспитанность!
Just having a blast
I fail to see the issue here.
🤣🤣🤣
I'm pretty sure this is a doctored footage. The real culprit(s) don't want you to know who they are. They are framing your dog.
I'd get the footage analysed by experts.
Be grateful this is all he does with all that energy
Is that your dog?
Forgot I had a dog! Darn!
As nice as I can say this—you should not become a detective lol.
Such a good boy
Good boy!
My pup used to love getting all riled up on the bed like that, just absolutely losing her mind going nuts. We just lost her a few days ago, so seeing this and being reminded of what a goof she was really helped me smile again. Thanks very muchly, kind stranger 💙
taking your dog out for a walk everyday even for a bit  and you'll see an improvement in the dog behavior. i had a dog who would try to escape and the other would break things but after taking them outside more, they stopped that
ahh yes, you have a case of the huskies
Movie title “Paranormal Activity K9”
It just got better and better

OP, have you thought about getting a second dog? This pup is way too happy to have only a stuffed animal as its buddy.
Paw-ranormal activity
Are dogs even real? Feels like we got it too good in a world with them
My dog would bunch up the blanket like that to...mount....so I'd be careful
Easy solution. Stop making your bed.
Dogs are wonderful creatures.
Someone needs to entertain their doge
Hmm couldn’t figure it out???  Yeah that dam hamster huh!!
It's warm and smells like you. He looks to be going for all the hot spots haha.
Look how happy he is!!!!! I love that
i CoULDnt figure it ouUT
Omg when he grabs the blanket 😂 so funny
There’s positive stress and negative stress in life. I consider a happy little mutt joyously unmaking the bed the perfect example of positive stress.
What kind of bed is that? It made zero give with that puppy and I need it!
TOO FUNNY 😄
r/zoomies would appreciate this as well.
My shepherd/cattle dog will do this to bunch up the blankets, then she'll stick her nose under and flip them up so she can crawl underneath.
Anytime there is chaos where there once was order:

The answer is *zoomies*
With a dog this rambunctious, it took a camera to figure this out?
At least you got a happy ass dog ! This reminds me of my Pomeranian…dude is a psycho
I didn’t even need to see the crate to know it was doggo. Mine does the same thing.
Fuck yo bed
What an adorable spazz!!!  😂😍
Well that was too adorable!
When the dog be gaslighting you-
without the camera footage Jesus Christ would have been the only logical suspect.
You didn't know you had a German Shepard?
That’s too funny
> first 30 seconds

I think 'unmade' is a bit of an exaggeration. The dog just rumpeled the sheets a bit

> last 15 seconds

Okay, wow the dog really unmade the bed
I would pay to see the closed caption.
He knows what he's doing. He's laughing while he's doing it lol happy doggy!!
Someone being bad as hell lol.
My dog does the exact same thing the little turd.
Yea musta been a real puzzler
Haha, love it. I used to call it bed/carpet swimming when we had bigger dogs in the house.
More the lieky happy to be out of that horrible cage.......
i surprised!
He looks like such a happy happy dog, love it. Im sure the OP gives the doggy allot of love. This vid made me smile, thank you
I love this dog. I do the same thing while my girl works from home. She comes in to fix the bed then it’s on.
looks like this is the best part of your dog's day
Sorry but my first thoughts would have been my dog. Classic doggy move.

Have giant dog.  Kennel in bedroom where dog sleeps. Kennel door is open.

Leave for 4 minutes.  Slobber on everything.

Can't figure out how bed gets mussed up.

Invest $500.00 on camera system.

*"Oh shit!!!! It's the dog!!!"*
Why is nobody talking about that cage? Cameras and cages in a bedroom? Is the dog into bsdm?
this gets better the longer u watch it lol
Protip: switch the dog to decaf.
We don’t deserve these magical creatures.
You call that a made bed?
You really couldn’t figure that out eh
That Ghost has a case of the morning zoomies.
He said...Fuck this bed
This is a daily routine for him? 🤣
That cross on the wall had me thinking this was a Paranormal Activity situation. I’m relieved.
r/AnimalsBeingDerps lol
![gif](giphy|l0HlB51rLWsWTXEkM|downsized)
Hey OP, is it German Shepperd,?
I have a Boston terrier who gets into the middle of the bed then spins around until the blankets wrap her up then she falls over sideways and that’s how she naps.
I have a husky / pyr mix and he does the same shit.
im sure you could have guessed
😂😂
It's perfectly normal ghost behavior.

 Pawanormal barktivity if you will.
how can you "not figure it out" if you have a dog and it's clearly the only thing that could've unmade your bed?
I have a boxer puppy, he also likes to wreck my bed right after I make it.
Iconic
What a nice girl!!! 🙏😍
The dog hair wasn't a hint enough?
I have an underlying appreciation for other people that do hospital corners in their sheets.
ahhhh the typical i need internet attention post. you own a fucking husky ya weirdo
Love the bedroom crating. So good.
I can't figure what this good she is doing but she s doing fine!
Jesus, I'm glad I have cats.
Couldn't figure it out?  Did you not know you had a dog?
Amazing how much fun dogs can have completely alone lol.
Hard to tell with the lighting, but is that a husky? If so, you could probably have a long conversation about who is at fault.
Awwww. I love lil dog greebles and zoomies. This just made my day, and reminds me of how my lil old man used to be.
The nice thing about pets is that they always give you an excuse to write off the nagging voice in your head that says "home invaders" or "ghosts". 

Bed disheveled? Dog. Strange noises in the middle of the night? Dog. Blood stains on the wall in the handwriting of your dead ex boyfriend imploring you not to forget about him? Dog. Clean it up and go to bed.
The twist is that be doesn't have a dog.
Looks just like my liver German mutt
That is the cutest fucking thing I’ve seen in my life
My dog insists upon sliding in between the comforter and the flat sheet all the time 🤦‍♀️
yr first mistake is that you let the dog inside….
Your coffee machine is just realllly loud when it's on
You will forever have a messy bed but you can sleep well in it knowing that this apex predator has been honing its skills daily.
I see you have a crate in the corner, crate  me human owner and I’ll show you!  that is too funny
You live with a dog and didnt figure that it was them messing the bed up? What was the other options, a ghost?
Lmaooo I love dogs so much
Sweet baby 😍🖤
Like an overgrown fox
what a good boy
I know as soon as my dog realizes he can make the jump onto our new bed himself, he’ll start doing this.
I have a husky mix that will do this. Goofy boi. I love it.
Love this - so energetic!
Never owned a dog but, doesn’t all that hair that must get everywhere annoy you?
Too funny
I hope that cameras gone now that you solved the mystery.  Putting a camera in your bedroom is putting a whole lot of faith in the security awareness of the company that made that camera for the cheapest they possibly could.
What kind of dog is that!? Mine looks exactly like it but we got ours from a shelter and don’t know his breed
I peed a little.🤣
