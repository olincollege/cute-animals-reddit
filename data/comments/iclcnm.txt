Needs to be put on r/piratepets !
CHAMPION!
Your friend might want to check out some sort of wheelchair for him. A young dachshund might be ok now but they are so prone to back problems and a supporting wheelchair might help with that. 

A family friend got a super cool off-road one for his large dog with hip problems. The hip is supported but the hind legs still reach the ground. The difference is amazing. At home he gets around without it just fine. But now he can run around outside without pain!
At first gance he looked like a veteran dog that went through tough times
I hope they got a 25% discount.
Now you can tell everyone you have a 3 foot weiner.
I've always wanted to adopt a three legged dog, but don't want to go out of my way trying to find one. How awkward would it be to be the guy known for calling up shelters or rescues: "Do you have any three legged dogs?" AND then you have the compatibility issue, so when I do find one it might not even like me for whatever reason.
LIL BRUDDER!!!
This is really unfortunate. Dachshunds are already prone to back problems. This guy has a rough life in front of him.
He just looks so courageous and steadfast.
he only have three leg and he stand anyway such cuteness very strong 100/10 dog
And so I name thee Tripod
Hi everyone! 

THIS IS MY PUPPY MICKEY!!!! 

I adopted him just over a month ago - his leg was amputated as it was severely deformed after bad breeding. He was abandoned by a breeder because he was not going to make them money. He was left in a cardboard box on someone‚Äôs front steps. 

PLEASE adopt, don‚Äôt shop!!! Support your local animal sanctuaries if you can. 

If you want to see more from my little Mickey, follow miniaturemickey on insta or my insta ecofriendlyemily :) 

Thanks for all your kind messages - he is such a trooper and a wonderful dog!
So adorable
God I love dachshunds! It‚Äôs like they have ears as wings and they flap while they run!

Always upvote the 3-leggers!  Yay for your friend and this pirate.
Friend: "My wiener is a tripod."

Please tell your friend to look after this little fella, ramps everywhere.  No jumping up furniture.  Maybe a back brace too for good measure.
<3 <3 <3 <3 <3
I would name this guy "premium hit dog" because the missing appendage only adds to his character. 

Apologies if it's actually a girl.

Edit: was supposed to be "premium hot dog" but I'm leaving it.
But he forget to get the fourth leg
Omg.. This dog is such a cutie. I am a dog lover myself. I would totally adore this dog and adopt it. This dog is amazing in its inperfection.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Daschunds are the most noble of all dog breeds and don't @ me

Rescues are the best, they do make rollers for dogs legs, this pup will give back much more than people sometimes understand. We have a like one, Bean, a mix and great tyrant.
Tripod!
Omg he is beautiful! What a good looking dachshund
What do you call a three-legged Dachshund?  

A leaner dog
Cute
Great choice. Best feature is he'll always be stable on an uneven surface.
The little pup that could.
At ease Private Doggo. At ease.
Omg the cutest!
Doing a good job
Awww so cute
Aww I have a tripod who's missing the same leg!
One time on a tumblr video I saw a cat who was named yardstick because he had 3 feet.
This is my husbands dream dog!  A 3 legged wiener!
All he needs is a knight and he‚Äôll be ready for war rawwwr !!!
Awww...incredibly sweet! üêæüê∂‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww he‚Äôs too cute ‚ù§Ô∏è!!!Pls thank your friend for adopting üòä
Only thing in my shelter is beagles and pits. I would love a tiny little gem like this
If you're happy and you know it...
He couldn't afford the whole thing?

Edit: I apologize.
Better have been at a 25% discount.
We had a dog that looked just like this, Trinka! She did have all her legs though. Aw man she was so precious and would give you kisses with her terrible breath any chance she had.
When the picture first opened I burst out laughing at the missing leg.  I had started at his face, then his body and he looked so happy and healthy that I didn't notice at first.

He looks like he's a real ball of fire and a joy to be around.  Kudos to your friend, and to you as well for sharing!
What happened to his leg?
10/10 would pet!
Awwww so cute!!
Good choice
He looks like a sweetheart!
U/somethingapis
He is not only a cutie... he is stunning - like a dog supermodel!
So adorable
That is the cutest doggo aroundüòç
A noble and proud pup. They made a good choice.
Dachshunds were honestly one of the breeds I thought I'd never want to get. They're just so heavily morphed and I always feared the issues they'd have from their body length.

However by unintented and undesired means I ended up an owner of a mixed dachshund that looks like a brown-spotted white terrier in the shape of a dachshund. Wow. They're simply fantastic. Their personalities and the resulting habits are lovable, and their affection and interaction levels are off the charts. Truly a breed you can't regret, unless you're an irresponsible kind of dog owner who owns dogs as some form of trophy rather than family member
Look how proud he stands! I bet he's just as stubborn as any other dachshund! My old girl used to look down on the world from as short as she stood.
Well if that dog doesnt warm my icey heart üòî
So cute!
Such a Regal pose!
Shake!
Omg who's a cute little tripod?  You are <3
This threw me off not gonna lie
10/10 would smooch that pooch.
Did they get it 25% off?
‚ÄúI haz 3 legs‚Äù
He ain‚Äôt got no leg
Such a cute leaner dog
Let me guess: A pit bull ate one of its legs. I see it in shelters all the time.
Hope you got a 20% discount
Bruh
Sir Tripod, at your service.
I'm a big fan of dachshunds
Respect to that friend and awwwww for that cutie
His face says ‚ÄúI must protect new human with my life no matter the cost‚Äù
Smart, less dog, less food needed.
Ah, it is love then. I love this dog.

Yep, want.
Love him
What did you do to his leg?
They put her leg in the wrong spot.

Keeping him in a leash must feel like a real drag.

What a gorgeous doggo!
Wow looks a ton like a childhood dog I had!!
That doggo needs a lego.
I just learned that they need small steps to go up stairs or they‚Äôll be hurting real bad by the age of 6 or so from arthritis. So like a step between steps to help them not strain to bad would do the trick. They‚Äôre a cutie, though! Happy for you.
...and named him Tripod...
Tripod Dog
Champion!
Should be titled "Tres Weenie"
Trike would be a perfect name
That‚Äôs a really cute cat
I have a 3 legged baby and she runs like the wind never knows she only has 3.

I love a tripod!  I had a tripod once.  She still had the leg but carried it up high and walked on 3 legs unless running.  Jack Russel.

What a MAJESTIC looking animal. They are NOT letting a missing leg, hold them back. Just want to spoil him rotten.
He is brave and willing to go on an adventure!

‚ÄúA three legged puppy, is not a happy puppy.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat suggesting Jim? Oh, oh no.‚Äù
Dachshunds are the best dogs in the world. What a cutie.
What a majestic gent 10/10
STOP THIS DOG ISN‚ÄôT REAL! It‚Äôs much too precious to be real.
"A three legged puppy... Is not a happy puppy..."

And this line will be forever planted in my head because TipsyDuck is a sadistic motherfucker when it comes to climbing trees.
Alice in Chains (1995) except much cuter
Aww üíõ
Out of curiosity, I know Dashunds tend to be more susceptible to hurting their back and becoming paralyzed. Would missing a leg increase this chance since the body moves differently? Still is the cutest Dashund I've ever seen regardless! ‚ù§Ô∏è
The name is Hund. 
Dachs Hund
What a cutie pie üòç
I'd name the doggo tricycle
this reminds me of an avengers level threat in battle cats so theres a german sheperd which attacks very quick and creates shockwaves and his walking aniation looks like this doggo
Always pointing
Beautiful!!!!!!!!!!

Dude I don't want to bum out your friend or anything but I'm pretty sure that dog only has 3 legs
Looks like a little army sergeant reporting for doody.
I'll never not love a three-legged dog.
He looks so confident, I love it. doggoü•∫
*gotcha leg* sorry i couldn't help myself
I‚Äôve always thought it would be awesome to have a three legged dog and just make fun of it all day while using a really happy tone. Like ‚Äúawww who‚Äôs missing a leg?!?‚Äù and it would jump up and down like I‚Äôm praising it. Best of all worlds
I have fought in world war, I was so fluffy I stopped the bullets for my fellow comrades and now I'm smol
What a sweetheart ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è

He is beautiful! Look how proud he is looking at whatever that is!!ü§ì
That‚Äôs so cute ü•∫
I have a special place in my heart for tripods. My dog (Hero/M/1999-2013/RIP) growing up was a front paw amputee as well and he was one of the best dogs I've had the pleasure to know. He's long gone now but still comes to me from time to time in my dreams. 

Congratulations u/beerus1995! Your puppy is beautiful! Keep in mind that dogs learn helplessness so try not to carry him too much. As other's have mentioned Dachshund's tend to have back and hip problems as they age. 

My boy was fine without prosthetics and adapted very well to life on 3 legs. He could run, jump 6 foot fences and do all the dog things. He had a hard time figuring out to scratch his itches though. He would walk across the couch back to get 'em though. (We would call it autopetting)ü§£

Dogs who are differently abled like to be adopted too.
You should name him Cigarette, because if he loses anymore legs you'll have to take him out for a drag.
Wiener on a tripod.
What happened with his leg? And how does he look when he walks?
At least he wont teach his dog the nazi saulte
Animals are born with three legs and a spare!!
Was there a discount for only having three legs?
Need a helping hand?
I really wish they'd stop breeding this type of dog. I've seen too many paralyzed dachshunds in my life.
I‚Äôm sorry are your eyes painted on? Ugly ass dog
are we already at the stage where we photo-amputate our dogs to farm reddit karma??!
Worthless with 3 legs. Might as well serve him in a chinese restaurant
