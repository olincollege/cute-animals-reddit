This little guy wants to know who you are and do you have any food.  lol.

Highland cattle [can be extra fluffy and extra friendly.](https://i.imgur.com/6AmRXEt.gifv)
They look so cuddly, like big teddy bears.
Love seeing cows in the woods. A lot of people don’t realize they are woodland creatures. 
Why two tags?
this cow has a better hairline than me smh 
All cows are cute, but I really love seeing baby fury cows.
I love Highland cattle. 💖

I get why vegans don't wanna eat these things.
Aww fuck I might go vegan you guys

Edit: what I got silver!!! This is my first medal thank you anonymous redditor!!
I don’t know why but this lil guy looks like Patton oswalt, 
[deleted]
Thanks I'm now a vegan 
This is why no one should eat animals they just wanna doop around and be happy. 
*moore cows
Baby cow mlems are pretty cute
these cow posts are making me feel guilty lmao
YAY Cooooos!!!!
Forest cows :)
Pretty sad that she's gonna get slaughtered
I want to see a future where this guy is our buddy.  He doesn't have tags in his ears and he isn't destined for our kitchen tables.
Dad... dad? These earrings SUCK. 
Farm puppies 
Nice try! This is Endor and those are Ewoks.
Everyone noticing how cute these cows are and feeling guilty.  You can always reduce your consumption.  Too much red meat is not good for you anyway.  Limit yourself to once a week or several times a month and try to eat other leaner and healthier sources of protein such as chicken and fish.
BOOP THAT GOTDAMN SNOOT
People call people cows when they’re fat and ugly but honestly cows faces are literally adorable. 
No, it was more cowbell.
Oh my gosh so so cute!!
YOURE DOING GREAT SON
That's not a cow it's a coo!
Please pet the cow!
yes finally as a vegan and cow lover i want to say THANK YOU 

edit: whoever gave me my first silver, thank you :,)
Hi, my name is Clohe and I wanted to liiiiive
We see people with pigs as house pets, but never anyone with cows as a house pet? Someone should take this cows and make **mini** versions we can keep as pets, as they're so cute! (Also, I'd like a house hippo, please).
awww dammmit im a vegetarian from now on
Yak in the bak needs a haircut

Scottish Highland cattle are great. We had 13 on our ranch. They were great pets. The bull was named Wooly Booger. They loved being pet and hand fed. The calves are always very curious. 
Is this what reddit is obsessing over today? Better than some days, I guess.
I spent part of my hike this past Sunday with cows. Unlike this adorable fluff ball, they were skittish when I motioned towards them. They were scared of tiny chihuahuas that some people were walking with. 
I can’t talk right now...we got cows 
Is this boop forbidden? With that bull murder me? We will find out right after this commercial 
Ok: who blow dried the cows again?
Why are the cows ears tagged?
❤️🐂
I love cows! 

Side question: Anyone know what that type of tree is called?
Floof...
adorable
Awwww that's so cuteee
How moooooving
A nose worthy of a boop
I LOVE HIGHLAND COWS MORE THAN ANYTHING

Ps am drunk 
That’s a coo
I don’t like his earrings ....
Brown cow stunning!
I do now...
Please tell these aren't cows for eating
I grew up with cows and they are literally the cutest (and somehow stupidest) animals I have ever encountered.



If they have to be bottle raised (mom died or refuses to care for them) they literally think and act like they’re dogs. They will follow you around mooing loudly. It’s common to have them in the house on a family farm, if they’re sick or too cold. They are so cute!!

Ever since I was a kid I've been saying if I win the lottery I will buy my own island and put a bunch of cows on there so me and my cows can live out our lives happily on cow island 🤷🏻‍♀️😁
*MOOre cows. 

FTFY
As an urban kid... that's a cow?!?
I love seeing these cows but the tags in their ear just bring tears to my eyes
I did not. But I'm happy someone else did.
I’ll take three
Nice jewelry. Looking more and more like the young women I meet in Seattle on a daily basis.  Cow pulls it off better though.
The Cowlvary Has Arrived. 
cows are wonderful, loving people
When I grow up, I want to go to bovinae university 
Who ever thought "lemme kill this thing and taste it." Must have been one crazy person.
Damn I want to be a vegetarian again.
This cow wearing airpods!
FLUFFY MILK HORSE!!
Ok, ok that is freaking cute as hell.
Nice earrings. 
FLUFFY MOO PUPPERS!!!
Vids like this always makes me want to be a vegetarian. 
Could you at least remove the plastic from its ears first?  Who the fuck comes up with this shit and thinks it's okay?
I demand that these cows are shampooed, conditioned, and then blow dried
"Moo bitch"


"THATS my boy!"
My wife is a city girl who finds cows to be awesome, adorable animals. She's not on Reddit and the more cow posts I can show her the more husband points I can get haha
What a cutie. What kinda cow is that anyway?
Those are cows? Fuck imma go vegetarian again
Aww the baby moo
Further evidence  cows are just grass doggos

"Moo, bitch!"  


"That's my boy!"
Omg!!! It’s a snuggly teddy-cow! 
Sir, that's a Forest Fluff not a "cow".
I could watch this until the cows come home.
Can I name all of them 'Fluffy'?
This needs more cowbell

That’s one fluffy heifer!
Thats the shit what makes me wanna go vegetarian

What's with all those cow posts lately? And why are there so many? Did you store them and wait for the perfect moment to make me r/aww? Well damn yes I always r/aww by those posts!
HOOO DAAIRE DISTURRB OUR WEE WOUD??
Why are there tags on ears? Are they going to be slaughtered?
She is forever someone, never some thing. The reaction to love and adore her is natural; our conditioning to commodify her body and abandon ethics for the taste of her flesh is not.

cows in forests always trips me out because I usually only ever see them on flat grasslands.
Aww his poor ears. Both of them too :( 
that's a dog at this point.
Dad I dunno about this!

YOU'RE DOING GREAT SON!

......mmmmoooo BITCH!

THATS MY BOY!
Bunch of fucking meat eating idiots with cognitive dissonance remarking on awwwness of cows. 
PLEASE DO NOT EAT THESE BABIES. They are beautiful, thoughtful creatures. Just the fact that they have tags on them is sad because you all KNOW where they are going. Next time you choose to eat an animal, let's see if we can roast your dog or cat along with it. 
Say goodbye to fluffy in the New Green Deal
... And now I'm a vegetarian
Yeah it's awww until you see the horned parent in the back staring and kicking up dirt with one leg like it is about to charge..
"Aww" another poor baby who is just gonna be murdered or artificially inseminated over and over again, and have their children be taken away from them, until they are eventually killed.
I feel like cows wont move unless they absolutely have to. 
Pet them, immediately. 
I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him...
This looks a lot like the video with mouths over a bunch of cows and this lil guy says

"...mooooove bitch!"
"that's my boy!"
Adorable, yet very strange earrings.
I love those fuzzy little guys
That subreddit was severely lacking of cows! Thanks!
Reminds me of an ewok.
A nice woody taste enhances the flavour of the meat. 
[deleted]
The ways we've come to treat such animals :/
Knowing the tags mean “marked for food” breaks my heart some.

You're definitely steering the right direction with the cow videos
How do we know cows haven’t gotten smarter and developed intelligence beyond my undying need for ribeyes?
What a great video.

OMG! I LOVE cows. Especially fluffy ones. Sadly, I am highly allergic to them and can't even pet them.  I seriously wish I could have a pet cow. Thanks for posting this OP, I can watch it all day. :)
