I’m not sure who is lazier in this scenario.
I’ve never seen more apathy from both parties ever.
Cat’s getting a full measure of love. 

^(I’ll see myself out )
Socially distant scritches
“I love you 3000 millimeters.”
Sometimes it’s just too hot to cuddle
Cats love those amazon boxes
god i wish that were me
I hadn’t laughed today until I saw this. Thank you!
the second I started rolling out the tape, my kitteh would go full crazy and then it's play time instead
They are both my spirit animals
Talk about long distance relationship
#quarantinelife

Edit: oops didn’t mean to make that bold and yelly, sorry.
Double diamond difficulty.
Anyone else try to figure out what they're watching when someone's tv is in the background. Like what if we had been watching the same thing at the same time this was recorded. Wild
Amazon is the best thing that’s happened for cats since catnip
First comment ever on this site. Came here just to say my mom has the same exact couch. & that’s something my cat would probably make my mom do
Yes human this is acceptable
Anyone else just really impressed at how rigid that tape is?
r/thisismylifenow
Can’t tell who’s more lazy the cat or the hooman nonetheless innovations it’s finest
Social distancing gone too far!
Social distances
I love you to the moon and back
The petting meets minimum requirements
Everyone gangsta until the tapeline folds
⬥⬥

**DIFFICULT**
One to rule them all
Social distance petting
the cats face is amazing
I hote those things so much. A little bit of a finger displacement and you destroy it when retracting it.
Yeah, my cat probably thinks I order him a new box every week. I don’t. It’s impulse buys on amazon.
I’m 99% sure that’s why tape measures were invented – to see from how far away we can pet our pets.
"And thats what life would have been like if I had invented the finglonger, one can always dream, one can always dream."
Fucking cats rock!
Looks like a do nothing Friday.
Petting the animal yet, Social Distancing, truly impressive lol
Modern problems require modern solutions
"This demeans us both..."

"Yes."

*Neither make any attempt to move whatsoever...*
What does that poster mean? "Difficult"?  


I dont get it! Now I'm afraid I am stupid
i really wanna know what they’re watching for some reason.. just caught my eye i guess
This has everything Reddit loves:

- Girl
- Suspense
- Surprise!
- Cat
- Cat in box
- Random art
I have the exact same auto feeder. Amazon?
Hi guys, I just want to say thank you for the awards. There are *65* of them as I write so unfortunately I can't thank you individually. You know who you are though 💕
I have that same ikea couch
This is my box. There are many other boxes like this, but this is mine
I have question.

The difficulty poster?

That is a very badly written question, but it is still a question.
“Difficult” indeed
How's he measuring up? Or are measuring his patience?
Double black diamond difficulty here
Now that's how you pet a cat. I'm going to try this on my wife.
The Wes Anderson Collection! 
Great book.
Dope shirt
Laziness and ingenuity go hand in hand
Cats.....

You buy them an expensive comfy cat bed for them to sleep on = NOPE!

You buy yourself something off Amazon = Cat's favorite bed is the Amazon box.

2020 in a nutshell.
Cat: "Just look at this lazy little shit. Scratching me from so far.... Ahhhh"
Cat demands:

> Head petting

> Must not be touched

Outcome: RESOLVED
OP's username describes everyone in this video perfectly.
Is there an aww without cats
This just looks like social distancing with extra steps
My cat loves a tape measure too, whenever I'm using one she likes a scratch from it but will also try to bite it, swipe it, fight it then back to rubbing her face all over it. This is the way (of the cat). Standard response to all things including humans! The only thing that doesn't get treated in this way is a cardboard box, that is loved unconditionally!
Our cat instantly throws up when he hears the rattling sound of the tape measure.
How many feet is that?
cat:keep doing that my servant!
I tried to do this with my dog but she is afraid of the tape measure.
So that's how you safely scratch a cat
When you love your cat, but you're both super lazy.
Is that Alone on the TV?
Hmm, looks like someone has a huuuge pp
Lol😂
Amazon: providing beds for cats all over the world
Hopefully it doesn’t come back
Social distancing done right.
I have both the same water fountain and automatic food dispenser! They’re great.
 What movie were you watching?
Give 'em an inch....

Any relation to the ten foot pole?
Social distancing ??
Human you are measuring my patients.
I dig the difficult sign right above the said action.
We've got the same cat fountain!
Six feet apart... more like a lazy way to scratch them.
Social distancing
Head scritches are universal.
I see, they went with the same brand of box my cats prefer too.
Content kitty with box and head rubs.
Aww we have that same water machine!! Our pets love it!
Press the retractable button
I admire her intelligence.
I think I have the same couch as you, by any chance from IKEA?
Stoned skiers in the summer.
We have that same couch, it’s awesome. And happy floof is a bonus
I need that ski sign
Aaawww so cute <3
Currently sitting on my always pulled out IKEA sofa bed infront of the TV, too.

Respec
Both are to lazy for anything. One is to lazy to pet the kitty, and the kitty is to lazy to get mad
We are sending people into space....
Very cute video. So many accidents happen.
"I will allow this" -the cat
That cat is dope as fuck
Where can I order one?
That's how I use to change channels back in old days.
Does anyone else’s cat go CRAZY about the tape measure??
I have to put my cat in another room if I need to do any down low measurements or it’s a nightmare. She tries to bite on the thing and it’s hard, thin metal, wth??
Look at that social distancing
Social distancing.
I think both are lazy... hahaha
My favorite thing about this is the look on the cat's face
Modern problem, modern (lazy) solution
hi
So.cute
That's a precious little pet you have there. 


Oh and the cat is cute too! 😀
"sometimes my genius, it's almost frightening."
We have the same couch. We also leave it as a bed most days.
What movie is that
Laydkhor
100% adorable! Thanks for making me smile!
Practicing social distancing... I like it
It reminds me of my gf who lazily play with the cats while watching tv lmao
What is that painting in the background with the word "difficult"
Llll
This is the actual definition of lazy in the dictionary; it even has their picture
Yeah this is pretty much life with cats. Love it.
That’s the only way to spend the day
<33
The only safe way to give cat scratches.
Love can’t be measured
The laziness on display at both ends of the tape measure is truly inspiring!
So amazing.
Оо
they both look equally motivated
So thats what those are for.
Pain
Cats and Amazon boxes. Name a better duo.
It’s not much, but it’s honest work
All i wanna know is if she actually stole that sign from a resort and rode down with jt...props if so.
Gotta keep exactly 1.5 meters apart and the best way to make sure that you are is with a tape measure
So that's what life would be like if I had invented the thing longer
Is anyone else seeing plumbobs?
this is so wholesome i cant contain myself😱
Social distancing. Exactly six feet apart!
Difficult
Social distancing pets done right
Im-paw-tant work
Ah yes the expanding yellow razor blades  how the tables have turned little kitty
Def going to try this when i get a cat some day in the future
If you unlock the tape measure, you'll have a follow-up GIF for r/StartledCats.
The cat does not look impressed 😂😂
He looks content ngl
When I saw the tape measure I thought she was practicing social distancing from her cat.
Catto demands pets, even while in box
I broke into tears that’s soooo cute!!!! 😢
I’m just waiting till she accidentally presses the button 😬
When you wanna pet your cat during a pandemic but it starts sneezing
Both of them living their best lives.
Modern solutions at their finest.
As a retired contractor that had to use a tape measure all day everyday..... Yup... Pretty much how I roll.
Social distant petting
Imma remember this
Remote work
👍
just lovely :D
Yes very important work indeed!
Or she could just bring the box over
Sometimes, if a cat is in the room, I'll use my cane to pet them. I can't bend to pick them up, and cats come when they damn well please, so I just...scritch the noggin with the end of my cane.

They seem to like it.
Anyone know where to get that Double Diamond poster?
Social distancing at it's finest 😂
Social distancing scritches
She's smarter than the one who demands for the feed
America is so lazy
She cleverly ordered this cat with Amazon Prime
When you wanna pet your cat, but you know she'll scratch you the moment she gets a chance.
Social distancing?
Pretty sure this was invented by professor Farnsworth.
I want that couch
Social distancing
A very measured approach to showing your cat love and affection
Aww cute/funny etc but let's get to the important issue here...

I LOVE your playsuit, where is it from?!
When you wanna do the social distancing rule but want to pet your friend at the same time
How long is his head
Social distancing
Social distancing
Appropriate social distancing I see I see
The cat be like 👁👄👁
She’s social distancing
This deserves gold
Laziness is no good unless it is well carried out... well done!
He looks like he doesn’t give a shit 😂
r/cattrapisworking
Social distancing
Damn COVID is tearing the family unit apart. Not eve. Our pets are safe from social distancing
Cat is like: "this is not good enough but I'm not getting up"
I’m very happy for your kitter but even happier for you double blacks and Wes Anderson collection. That cats got a good life. Are you watching behind enemy lines?
Nice Ikea Friheten you've got there
I like cats 🐱
We used to have a cat that would go bat shit crazy for those steel tape measures. If you couldn't find him around the house, rattling a food box would not bring him out from his hiding place. However, unwind a tape measure about a metre and shake it you would suddenly hear his tiny feet galloping from the other side of the house and crash into the room to immediately start attacking the tape measure. He either hated it or loved it with absolute passion. Yes we were careful that the he never hurt himself on the sharp edge...
Lazier still, he ordered the measuring thingy off Amazon, and the cat is sitting in the box it came in.
I like the lazy cat lady and the cat
Social distancing bro!
Cool black diamond sign
Both are really busy!
Who is filming it !! And how
I currently have 8 boxes of various sizes around my house that I can't throw away because my cat likes them.
Absolutely!! and the bestess job ever ❤️
My cat would be smacking, chewing, and trashing that tape measurer immediately if I tried this
R/vredditdownlader
"Seriously?...(sigh)...keep going"
Social distancing for the win
Why I dislike cats
The “difficult” picture up on the wall is perfect
Good quality tape measure. No bend to it.
Love the double black poster! Skier or mountain biker?
Well we did it boys, depression is no more.
This is how social distancing works, right?
*scratches head in social distance*♡
You're so lazy! 😝
THAT is an awesome way to quarantine these days ! 🐱🥰
Gotta maintain that social distancing
That's how you please the gods
Lockdown energy level in a nutshell
I try this with my dog but he hates the noise!
I'm glad I'm not the only one
Being too hot.
Being lazy.
Social distancing.
Being funny.
Being safe.
Being crazy.
Being inventive...
We're covering a lot of bases here. 

10/10 approve, if cat approves.
Why do I love this so much.
So now we have socially distanced petting too?
Lol. We could never do this to our cat. He is more terrified of the tape measure than the spray bottle or vacuum combined. So we started pulling it out when he’s naughty. He immediately stops being naughty and runs away.
Ah yes, also standard issue cat bed there.
So cutr
It's social distancing. She needed to know she was exactly 6 feet away.
Social distancing
whatever it takes
Can i get those pajamas thoooo
Tomcat: yes, it really is that long.
Bruh
Aww cute!! 

On a side note I can't believe that I've been watching bones all day xD
u/Vredditdowloader
I'm guessing six...
Your feet look like they smell like hot cheese and musk and sweat and gunk right now...
i used to only love dogs but as I broadened my outlook towards animals, I realised all the animals are lovable, no matter what they are. Some attack us because they're not used to humans or have had a bad experience with humans.
Laziness or safety
Yes Cattos must be pet!
Does it feel the same as petting it via hand?
😄
Catnip is bad. Mmkay?
[deleted]
Who is she?
Take a break and clean that place up!!! Lol
This is turning me on for some reason.

I thought they were measuring his glizzy
Now release the lock on the tape measure and watch that cat flip its shit.
😂
r/unexpected
Look out! The end can be sharp!
Owner too lazy to get up and pet him, cat too lazy to slap the shit out of them for this stupid idea
I wish, my cat would have so little expectations of the way she's petted 🙈
My little one always demands a full attention. You have to bow over her, always pet with both of your hands and! most importantly keep the eye contact with her. Don't you dare to lay down your head on whatever you're bowing over. Immediately you'll hear the reproachful meow 🙈
Ah, it's also appreciated, if you'd help her with the cuddle rolls 🤷
This is fucking dumb. How lazy can you get
She is measuring weather the cat is in range of her boltgun
