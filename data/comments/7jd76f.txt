I had a Black Lab for 17 years and it was impossible to keep him out of water, of any sort. Puddles or Lakes, he did not give a fuck and would roll around in 2"of water lol

~edit~

So many great Dog stories! 

I miss my dog from reading all these funny story's, but they're good memories :)
Hose before bros
We were on a trip home from Arkansas and we had made it about halfway back. We stop at a gas station to let our labs out. Our big yellow boy finds the nastiest puddle and just lays in it, coming out a dark brown new color. Labradors love water.
I came for the title but stayed for the dog.
Well I‚Äôll be labradamned.
He's labradabradoing his best okay.
That‚Äôs labradorable!
OP must be Doug Dimmadome, owner of the Dimmsdale Dimmadome.
Next stop, the couch!
I had a chocolate named Kody. One of his quirks was he would drink laying down. He would signal he was done drinking by flipping the bowl and laying in the puddle. I miss that pooch.

Please don't let him do that. All that run-off from lawns and gardens means he is being exposed to pesticides and other carcinogens. Labs are already cancer prone. Get him a kiddy pool and fill it with fresh water.

This is common your lab had water withdrawl. I have two chessies that will get in the shower with me or bathtub with my granddaughter rather then suffer a second of dry.

Sorry to be a Debbie Downer but if I remember correctly this pic is of a dog was taken by an runner on a distance run (like a 5 or 10k) in the middle of summer, which is a TERRIBLE idea. 


First, because people don‚Äôt realize that humans are some of greatest distance running mammals on earth. Just because your dog loves to walk and run, and can run way faster than you, doesn‚Äôt mean that a distance runner can‚Äôt wear a dog down- especially if the dog isn‚Äôt highly conditioned and trained like Iditarod dogs. There is a race in England every year where humans run a marathon vs a horse, and even though the horses have four legs, sometimes humans come pretty close to beating the horses. 

Secondly, this run was in the summer. Dogs have limited ways to remove heat, and this is exasperated when they are running on hot pavement where their foot pads gain heat, not lose it. 


This dog was exhausted and overheated, and he found one cool spot and refused to move from it. But his owner was all like ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù. 


To bad he isn't wearing a labracoat. 
Looks like a Labralog to me
My lab would push me into the water to avoid stepping his precious little paws in a puddle.

My black lab lived 14 years and despised water every day of his life. If it had sprinkled outside and the grass was a little wet, he would literally tiptoe around the edge of the yard to get to his pee spot. It was just as adorable as it was pathetic. Lol. 
So that blue line *isn't* a leash?

Jeeesis they fucking love water.  I've hunt dwith Labs for years and they always run towards fucking water.  It's literally unbelievably characteristic.

Edit: I've I always wondered if their hair has more hollow space like a polar bears.  They just gravitate towards running water, it's unreal.
I once watched my black Lab swim without stopping for 45 minutes straight.  Best dog ever.  I  miss her.  My next dog will be another Lab.

I had a black lab growing up. There was a small pond in the woods near my house, so naturally I took him there. He didn‚Äôt jump right in like I thought he might, even with some cajoling, so I threw one of his toys in the pond. He just looked up at me with these big sad eyes (‚Äúwhy‚Äôd you have to throw it in there??‚Äù), then stared at the toy, then looked back at me... never went in to get it. I bet it‚Äôs still in that pond somewhere. 
I was looking at the bin imaging it doing a scream.

I grew up around friends with Labs and they were wonderful. You couldn't keep them out of the water. A couple years later, my family got two and I have never seen dogs so afraid of water in my life. 
We had a pool in our backyard and nothing short of them thinking you were drowning could get them to voluntarily jump into a body of water.
Could have sworn there was a post like this with a picture like this and it was because the owners tried to run a 10k on a hot day with their dog...
Great headline
Labrador loves water. Mine do the same thing every time.
Aww, he's trying to be a chocolate lab!

Whenever I took first Lab, Black-Brute Block-Head Shisa, for country or field hike, he could find ANY mud-puddle within looong distance.  Then, would proceed to lay prone, supine, sideways in the muck, and refuse to come when called.  EVERY time Shisa was a no-show for "Shisa-COME! or ShisaTREATS?", I'd always find him laying in a puddle looking deliriously happy.  Can't even be mad he refused to come when called.
I could not love Labs more. Heckin good dogs

So funny. My family has had several labs, NONE of them liked water, for some reason. But this labradoo is so cute
We all rarf down here.  
I once had a Labrador a long time ago that was an anomaly. She hated getting wet and never swam willingly. She'd even step around puddles when it rained. Truly an unusual case.
My lab just liked to swim in our garage cans 
I love how there is a leash leading to this mess. 
My chocolate boy Buddy was so bad at labbing. He was the worst fetcher ever, and panicked in deep water but man did he love sitting down in shallow running water. He also loved giving kisses. He‚Äôs in dog heaven right now laying down in a trickle of water, barking at a never ending parade of UPS men, while licking somebody‚Äôs arm.

We had to put him down last month after losing the fight against lymphoma. He was the bravest, toughest boy and never once complained about how awful I know he felt towards the end. I‚Äôve had a few different breeds in my life and you just can‚Äôt beat a lab. I really miss my Buddy. He was absolutely the best.
He looks like a log floating in a lazy river. 
I wonder if my shepherd mix is part labrador. Never met a dog more into the water, other than labs. She will lie down like this, too.

Why? 
Isn't this just a [repost] (http://reddit.com/r/aww/comments/4rcnso/bring_your_dog_on_a_5k_in_louisiana_it_would_be/d4zzkyv) of a guy who [ran his puppy to exhaustion in a marathon in the middle of a Louisiana summer] (http://reddit.com/r/aww/comments/4rcnso/bring_your_dog_on_a_5k_in_louisiana_it_would_be/d4zzkyv)?
I see what you labradone there

We had a lab/golden mix who loved to jump in our pool. Only he wasn‚Äôt exactly in doggo MENSA, and he‚Äôd forget that you could swim to the shallow end and use the steps to get out. So you‚Äôd hear a splashy whining coming from the backyard, and you‚Äôd need to suit up, jump in with him, and push him and his doggy-paddling sharp-nailed paws to the shallow end so he could bound out and do a massive doggy-shake.   My brother loved to bounce him on the diving board into the pool‚Äîbiggest doggo smile you‚Äôve ever seen!  (And yes, we set up a gated fence to keep him out so he wouldn‚Äôt drown.)
