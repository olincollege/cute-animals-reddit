They do this while waiting on the mother to return. You would be surprised the places you will see a baby deer sleeping if you look hard enough!
This simultaneously relieves me and gives me intense anxiety at the same time
Also great are those who appreciate notes like this. I really admire someone who takes a moment to make others aware of our pets and wildlife.
I have serious fears about kittens hiding in my wheel wells after it happened to a family member. So I would 100% appreciate this note. 

(But I drive a teeny toy Yaris, so idk if a deer could even fit next to my teeny toy tires.)
Thank goodness the note was seen.  I'd hate to think of how things may have turned out otherwise üòï
The misspelling of 'deer' is endearing.
The last note I found on my car said, "You are a fish stick."
A friend of mine flew out to visit me last week, and when he returned and caught his Lyft home from the airport, he notices a note on his car's windshield. He initially thought "oh great, someone hit me," but then he read the note and it says "Do not drive! Baby kitten in your engine!" Sure enough, [there was](https://imgur.com/a/Cb0jGe0). 

He has dutifully not run the car for the last several days. Cat is still there. He's too much of an animal lover to run the risk.
As part of my work driving training they advise us to do 360 degree look arounds around a vehicle before driving a company vehicle and I really recommend it for any time you drive. Take the extra 15 seconds to walk around and look underneath the car and if you‚Äôre feeling extra careful, open the hood and make sure nothing crawled into the engine compartment to keep warm. Can‚Äôt tell you how often we get company wide emails of someone who‚Äôs child was playing hide and seek and they found them underneath the car or hiding in the space between a wheel and the wheel well in a large lifted truck, etc.

It‚Äôs good to get in the habit of looking around your car before getting in and driving away.
I love this human being without knowing this human being.
Little guy must have been *tire*d
I would have just moved the deer instead of risking the person not seeing the note.
Yes but I think I‚Äôd have moved the little fella along anyway.
I sent a similar text to our lawn service about the 4 baby foxes living under our shed
Some refer to it as a fawn
"There's a special place in heaven for animal lovers, that's what I always say."

One more reason to own a motorcycle. So when the deer sleep under the steering wheels, I can use another mode of transit.
That thing would bolt the second the engine started up.
Might be a better idea to just scare the deer off.  Less chance of, say, the wind blowing the note away, or the driver being an asshole
Why not move the deer and write a note letting them know to keep an eye out for that baby deer
It's always nice when someone cares enough to give a heads up.

My grandma used to call me absentminded and its true, I constantly miss things. This could have ended in tragedy, had it been my truck.
This could have ended tragically
Please be aware that a baby, dear, is sleeping right under your tire
POV: Op ordering a pizza delivered to his car while waiting for mama dear.
Not only did they try to protect the fawn, they also corrected their spelling of ‚Äúdeer‚Äù in the process. Truly, a good and decent person.
The mother deer that wrote that has impressive hoofwriting.

Whelp. Guess I‚Äôm taking an Uber home in this case.
Shit‚Ä¶ looks like you‚Äôre riding your bike to work today.
Why not just move the baby deer?
Be honest.- You googled "baby deer" right after this as well
My coworker once started to drive home but after a couple minutes she could hear the mewling of a cat. She pulled over to check where it was coming from and there was a kitten in one of the nooks and crannies of the truck‚Äôs undercarriage. It was wedged in there near her front driver side tire. 

Turns out the mother was a stray that had hidden the kitten there during some flooding the night before at my coworker‚Äôs house. She drove home and as soon as she pulled up, the mother bolted out of the bushes as my coworker brought her kitten out of the truck. You never know what animals could be under or even hiding in your car.
Oh my goodness. I wouldn‚Äôt have the heart to wake him.
not all heroes wear capes

Plot twist: deer mom wrote the note.
[Good Samaritan?!](https://youtu.be/OIVB3DdRgqU)
Lol free deer
They couldn‚Äôt... you know... remove said baby deer from under the truck instead of writing a note?
The word for baby doe is a Dorito
I used to run quite a bit and once when I was in the black river falls area of Wisconsin on business I was doing an evening trail run. Almost tripped over a little deer like that. Scared the hell out of me but it didn‚Äôt move. I stopped for a second and heard mama snorting at me so I let them be and went on my way.
Truly a repost
These posts need to stop lol. It's so fake and Reddit lives for these posts. 

Imagine writing this down on a piece of paper and not moving the deer.

Imagine running over that and think: "Oh deer.."
So someone took the time to write that note.. then walk up to your truck and slide the note on your windshield also not waking up the baby deer, then u just happen upon the note also with out waking the baby deer up then happen to walk around to your passenger, and snag a phot of the little bambi? I call MEGA bullshit

As if it wouldn't wake the fuck up when the engine was started.

Holy shit I killed a lot of baby deer cuz I almost never check what's under my car
What a stupid note. 


The baby deer is clearly not sleeping.
Rambi.
Shit that trucks probably straight piped, baby deer would make like a tree and fuck off as soon as is it cranked.

WHY NOT JUST MOVE IT?!? CAN YOU IMAGINE THE INNER TURMOIL THEY WOULD HAVE FELT IF THEY ACCIDENTALLY BACKED OVER IT AND ONLY LATER DISCOVERED THE NOTE AND REALIZED WHAT THAT CRUNCH SOUND WAS WHEN THEY STARTED THE CAR?

*proceeds to run over deer* oh deers are soo clumsy and stupid
Oh no... Anyway..
That looks FAKE. 

I typed ‚Äúfake baby deer‚Äù into google and guess what I saw?

Oh Deer!
Bambi is too cute and innocent to ever be harmed.

Hits baby deer anyway. FREE LUNCH BABY
Not to be dramatic, but I would die for that deer.
Fawn. The word is fawn.
Drives anyway.
**proceeds to get in car and slam gas**
I would just chase it away

**"NOT FOR LONG!"**
This is not what a Good Samaritan is. This is a just a nice person. Samaritans and Jews hated each other. Unless the person who put that note on the truck is your enemy, this is merely an act of kindness.
LMAO, if i was the person, the turnout would be different, i swear to god
[removed]
If it were me the deer would have already been gone, then I'd be checking and rechecking my tires for 20 minutes.
Pretty sure the guy wrote the note himself.
Jesus Christ, clean under your fingernails you animal
Sometimes the ability to camouflage isnt good
Good to honk gently before starting your car, esp. in winter.
Great now I'm gonna look under my car before I go to drive it
How sweet!
Seriously cute little baby deer! Must protect little Bambi.
Oh deer..
Pretty good note from a deer, especially one so young.
I mean that's a 5.7l, I'm guessing just turning that thing over would be loud enough to wake and make that little fella scarper
THAT MAN SAVED A LIFE WHAT A LEGENED
Wait isn't that deer is Bambi?
Awwwwww
I have a friend that lives on a farm and a beloved dog passed in this exact way a couple years back. Apparently he made a habit of taking naps under people‚Äôs‚Äô tires.
In the UK I often find them at the vertex of an overbridge crossing our canals. Many of our deer hang around the canals and so leave their young in such tight spaces.  


I usually just drop some bread nearby when I'm cycling just so they have a snack while they're waiting for momma.
Hope exists in humanity!
Plot twist: OP is the hunter who killled Bambi‚Äôs mom.  Bambi was waiting under the car planning a sneak attack of revenge!
what would you do in this situation if you had to move your car? i cant imagine it‚Äôd be easy to try and move it and if mama came back i figure she wouldnt be too happy to see you near her child
So adorable awe! That's sweet!
deaer
Glad the driver was not a hunter.
initial D eurobeat intensifies
We need more people like this person in this world that care and take the time to leave a note
Baby ducks do this same thing.

I will always check underneath my car and behind my wheels before I drive anywhere no matter what now.
Assembly for the next avenger: ‚ÄúNo no no, This has to be the guy‚Äù
That‚Äôs funny, this happened to me except it was just Terry Bernardino in a slutty deer Halloween costume and he wouldn‚Äôt move until I gave him some crack

‚ÄúAmazing what you fuckin find‚Äù
I know it‚Äôs hard to do time wise, but it‚Äôs a really good idea to walk around your vehicle before driving it.
Doh!
Please be aware that a baby deer is sleeping under your right tire.
I had a fawn run right under my truck while I was driving home after spending a day in my tree stand. I stopped to check on it and thankfully it expired quickly, but man did that suck.
Guess he was tired...
I once ran over a kitten who was sleeping under my tire.  When I got back his brother was looking at his body and me like I was a monster.  I feel terrible to this day.
Please be aware that this is now my Bambi
The kind of car notes you want to read :)
That extra dark 'e' in deer to cover up the 'a' lol
It‚Äôs obvious that the baby deer was the one who wrote that note.
Close call
This happens all the time in south central Texas.
A good samaritian ideed.

But how the heck do you like, carry the deer away so you can drive away???

Oh my goodness
Doe!!
I would take the other vehicle if there is another one..

This is a repost. Not yours
I work at a golf course and I actually found one in the long grass area. I also often often see deer running across the fairways.
That extra step that makes you a nature respecting person.

Nice of OP to write a reminder to their self.

Yeah

Somehow getting the deer to move would have been ideal. 

I would hate for rain or a breeze to contribute to a baby deer getting run over
Don‚Äôt read comments unless you want to hear about what happens if there isn‚Äôt a note on acreages
Carefully, he‚Äôs a hero
One day after work, as I was walking around the front of my car to get in and leave, I glimpsed a movement out of the corner of my eye. I stopped and stared at back of car and after a few seconds, saw a brief flash of something from a rear tire. Walk around to find this [Cecropia moth](http://www.daytoninsects.com/cecropia-poly.html) . It wouldnt fly away so I had to very carefully *pry* its sticky/grippy feet off my tire. Boy can those things hold on! What a fantastic, beautiful, and huge moth!
Why not at least move the deer from in front of the wheel and still keep it in the area?
Oh dear
What a nice person they are?
I wonder what he did.
Wild I didn‚Äôt know deer could write
Super repost
r/cursedcomments
Question: Is it possible to pick up and kinda move the deer? Obviously probably not since the original writer didn‚Äôt but what would happen if he did?
‚ÄúKeisha, get cha Lil ass ova here!! Whad I tell you about talking to strangers?!‚Äù
I wish I could see one of these from this close.
Good human.
It do be like that sometimes doe
Lmao the url to this post has the word sex in it
I imagined it was the mama who left that note. "Hey, put my kid here. Be back soon!"
Not anymore lol
As long as he doesn‚Äôt go into the meadow he will be OK.

Thank u for this pic. That is so sweet!  Good thing you did notice!
It's nice that who has written the note he has a pen to do it.
This guy has done one of the nicest things you can do. Respect.
Went home and had lamb for dinner
awww its so beautifull
Ooommmggg aaawww
Would love to meet the person who had he heart to do this.
‚ÄúFloor it upon start-up please‚Äù
Do deers have opposable thumbs?
Finest kind of human being...
He just could wake the deer up in the first place and then write a note..
Anyway he read that message that's all that matter
plot twist: It is a realistic statue of a baby deer. OP sits there waiting for hours to wake up.
How did they get close enough to leave the note and not wake the baby deer up?

Aww baby üò¢
Imagine hearing a crunch and then seeing the note
Awwww it‚Äôs Bambi
damn saved his life üòé
Why didn't the guy just move the duck instead of leaving a note?
me, on phone: "sorry boss, I can't make it to work. My truck is stuck."  
boss: "what do you mean, it's stuck??? get your ass over here asap or you're fired"  
me: "well you see, there's a baby deer sleeping under the wheel, and I don't want to disturb it"  
boss: "%#%$#@$#%@!! fine. I'll see you in tomorrow right on time."
There‚Äôs still plenty of goodness left on this planet üåé
Forgets to read the note: did I run over a rock?
That would be the best note to see!  Considering all the other notes left on vehicles.
Not really. Wtf wouldn't they just wake the deer.
* runs it over anyways
Wow,that's truly a good deed,&what a cutie that little deer is.
Sweet baby

Didn't know baby deer had such good handwriting.
Pretty shitty writing, but, then I remembered that a harried mother deer wrote it.
Credits to that good person
I saw a turtle digging a nest by luck coming home from the swimming hole.   Grabbed a towel and moved it away but that little creature tried to race me back to the hole.  Was scared I was going to hit it.   Luckily I can drive over 3mph so I made it out first lol
Be careful not to run-over Bambi the baby deer
Oh thank gawd it was the Ram 1500 and not the 2500, the driver probably would've run it over on purpose.
Yeah and if his in a hurry he will ignore the paper and run the baby deer over, but nice try.
the after result should go on r/50/50
baby dear
Easy veil
Ah good to know... *drives off*
CRUNCH
Omg this gives me anxiety and cuteness overload at the same time!
Oh, deer
When my company had closed the building last summer, I still had to go in a couple days a week. One day as I was leaving, I saw a baby deer just sleeping out in the open in one of the flower beds. I took a few pics and left it alone.
Thanks for the note.....pop.
Aahhh free dinner, nice that they saved it for you.
You already know it's had some bambi type traumatic intro to life on this foo planet

Why is this making me emotional?
Right.  Because deer are famous for their steely nerves in the face of LOUD NOISES right next to them.
It's very nice of them, but wouldn't you move the deer?  I mean i'd leave the note anyway because it might go right back
That‚Äôs freakin awesome
Aww so sweet and thoughtful
I don't know which is better. That adorable deer or the sweet note of noticing adorable deer

So what happened?

Ha ha he couldn't figure out how to spell deer ha
Deer me.
You live there now

If that deer is able to write a note then I would think it could check itself into a hotel.
It looks tired.
How much of elf is the person who left this note.

 No running away with the paper crumples.
I wouldn‚Äôt just write a note. I‚Äôd hold vigil there. Just in case....
good thing the deer didn't leave before the owner came back.
 

he would've looked forever and then had to give up and dreadfully drive away slowly expecting that he might be crushing a deer he couldn't see.
Yes, he is a sensitive, thoughtful man. Thank him for me too
Imagine he runs it over anyway
They definitely wrote dear the first try
Dude aww

I love this so much.
This is wholesome and everything, but this gets posted every other month. Are you guys not continuously browsing Reddit, orrrr
So what happened?
Come on everyone. It's pretty obvious the baby deer wrote that. Pretty courteous if you ask me.
I can believe this repost, 4th time maybe, has over 110k upvotes.  Go reddit.
I feel like I would move the deer. This seems dangerous

do deers live in samaria?

I read the message first, and thought I'll see a crushed baby deer under the tire. I was pleasantly surprised.
