Someone throw the ball for this sad dog before I start crying!
That bottom pup just enjoying life.
"Are they broken?" Such a concerned little face.
She looks so disappointed.
She's worried that her babies don't like sports as much as she does
Maybe it is a love offering. Her favorite toy for her loves.
I tried tossing the football at my infant he ain’t respond the correct way either...just sat there and let the ball hit him 🤦🏽‍♂️
The dog sees your interest in the puppies and puts her interest there since you keep lookin there. Play with her!
Her look is like "Are my babies broken? They don't play."


Edit: this has been my most upvoted comment yet in my short time on reddit. Haha. Thanks.
But mom we’re still just potatoes
“Sigh, 8 kids and none of you have the GOAT mentality to be the next michael jordan??”
She wants you to stop staring at the puppies and throw the damn ball lol
She's trying anything to keep those little assholes tired and sleepy so she can get some rest.
“They’re not big enough to play yet.”

“Impossible.”
I can SO relate, my brother was born when I was 11 and I'd literally never been around a baby. I tried to give him the rattle and rubber duck I had got him but he didn't do anything. I was so upset I cried and asked my Mother what was wrong with him! She got quite a laugh!

I thought he would be babbling and crawling and stuff.
"Why no play ball?" "Because they smol" "Ooooh"
Totally sweet. I am in love with this dog. That is a perfect disposition for a family dog. She Reminds me of the nurse-maid dog in the cartoon Peter Pan.
 Ohhh just someone play ball with me

(I am in LOVE with laid back sun bathing guy, he's so chilled lol)
Awww she looks so sad 😭😭
Pupper on the bottom just vibing
When our old dog had puppies, she would flip them over (not when they were THIS small) as they ran around with her- she’d put her nose under their tummy and roll them over, then keep running. Or she would just squash them. She’d get down with her tummy on the ground, then as the puppy cane running up she’d just go “plop” and put her paw on top of them and make them just go flat. They were never hurt, mind you- she just wasn’t the gentlest mum
She's soo gorgeous and smart!
she looks so worried poor girl
u/savevideo
She looks so sad
We’re going to need an update when they are big enough to play!
that is so sweet. she must be a young mommy
credit the damn source
Teach them young
I would do anything for the little cute one on it's back <3
Posted by a filthy reposting mod
Looks to me like she thought they might be dumb.
She looks so sad!
Labs are so loving I wish I had gotten a lab
The mom’s eyebrows, the puppy on his back at the end, I’m ded. 😭
"But I thought any children of mine would be gifted!'
Maybe she just wants to share her most prized possession with them

8 more children staying in a shelter
Why are there so many puppies?! Stop breeding... geez
When your dog gets pregnant, what do people usually do with the pups? Do people give them to family members so the dogs can still see each other? I hope
What a good mama
r/WatchPeopleDieInside
I want to adopt that one puppy that’s in its back. I am in love
GET YOUR PETS FIXED
Mommy aint raisin no quitters
Haha that sigh at the end after she sits down.
Her face! She’s so cute and so are her babies.
why aren’t you playing with my ball? 🥺🥺
Tiger mom, I expect you to be the best fetchers ever so we need to start NOW.
Adorable. How old are they?
NEED an update video of the pups playing with mom. It’s what the world deserves.
My heart
They'll grow, mama!
Her face
I need more videos of these pups and mom
She looks like she's about to cry
“Hooman, my puppers iz borked. Pls halp!!!”
“I want to have 8 kids so I’ll have 8 friends and no one can say no to being my friend.”
Momma doggo is so concerned, I want to give her a hug through the screen.
Omg. That is hilarious and sad all at the same time.
 I just wanna rub her forehead and tell her it's OK. Poor momma.
Can you share another video in two-weeks time?
This is so sweet.. when are you going to break the news that you plan to sell her children to strangers because money means more to you than anything else! That’ll really be a special day for her..
I wish we lived in a world , where they kept all 8 kids and they played ball with there mom everyday . 

I also want an update
The one upside down just adds that extra layer huh? Lol
The cutest thing EVER 😍
u/ceylin1 Dogs are hella cute yo
What dog breed are they?
Dont worry, your kids will love the ball when they grow up a bit more. Dont be so sad cute mom doggo with her cute little doggo babies.
So cute
I would do anything, pay any amount of money, walk any number of miles to cuddle with those puppies.
So Adorable :D
You had better rub that little ones belly.
High parental expectations.
Omg just give me one of those puppies 🥰🥰🥰🥰
She looks so concerned like "Are my babies broken???"
cute lol
How sweet❤️
I would kiss her whole face and give her a pile of treats.  Good girl!💕
Oh, dog.....poor thing. Lol
Me when I was trying to get my 3 year old to play lego batman with me.
😍
I think she brought you the ball.
Such a sad mama 🥺
😂 😂 Poor dog, she seems so miserable that her babies are broken and don't know how to play with a ball. Give a few more months mother dogress, they'll be playing in no time!
/u/vredditshare
Birth a whole team and none of them playing!
“They don’t like my favorite toy...”
p o t a t e
*I'll just sit here and wait for them to be ready.*
I’d really love an update at some point where the puppies will play with her
Her eyes.
~~Drops calculus test in front of newborns.  Similar reaction.~~
-Fixed, in front of me.
She looks exhausted.
Well that made my heart swell and break at the same time...
"You left, just when you were getting interesting!"
Awww too cute
Now that’s a mom that’s about to google milestones and discover BabyCenter.
All I see is the face of fear that she has to entertain them now instead of the ball. She just wants a break.
Mommmmmmm come on, I am growing right now
This might be the most harrowing thing I have experienced during the pandemic. SOMEONE CUDDLE THAT DOG AND TELL HER EVERYTHING WILL BE OK!!!
Awwww. So sweet❤
r/EyeBleach
Oh no she looks so sad. I wish they could talk
The music is on point
Omg I’m heartbroken
Still too smol.
Awww! That look on her face though.
OMG THAT FACEEE O.O IM GONNA DIEEE
So much cuteness
The dog's like "No mom, I want YOU to play with me!"
oooh my gosh. 🥺🥺🥺🥺 sooooooo cute.
u/vredditshare
Those eyes✨awwww
Awww you can see she’s disappointed they won’t play haha
She's a good mum, she is giving her babies challenges that help them learn. 😊😘🥰
She looks so sad!!!
"Why is no one having fun? I specifically requested it."
You better have thrown her the ball
u/savevideo
Don't know which is cuter, the puppies or the momma.
so cute
Aww 😍 This vid needs a u/SchnoodleDoodleDo!
I didn't know that dogs could get toddlered, too. That look on her face, aww!
I like that little fatty just chilling on her back.
Cute cute puppies  🥰❤️
She looks so sad. Cuddle her, pet her, give her a treat, DO SOMETHING
what kind of precious potats are these btw?!:);)<3<3
Those sad eyes... Love her
Dogs make me happy🥰‼️
Purple collar pup is mood
The one on her back is killing me
Oh... oh my...
that one kid laying on its back is all of us in 2021.
Is the promised heaven?
She's gonna be so happy when they're finally big enough
u/savevideo
What a good momma
I just bought a book that my two year old way too young for, I can relate!
That look on her face makes me weep.  I can't tell if its fearful wonder at how much love she is capable of or if she is just confused why her babies don't see the magic in ball.
May I share this and cite you?
Beauties
She brings the ball because it's her very favorite thing, but now they are her very favorite things.
OMFG Her face😭😭😭😭
Aw don't worry, they suck at it now but they'll get better
u/savevideo
r/eyebleach take notes. This is the type of content they should have there. Cause that momma's look got me ready to cry man
Worried mama
Sweetie pie
u/savevideo
why is the dog sad. distraught? confused?
The one on his back is omg so cute!!
Omg her sad little face! 😭
Her face 😂😂 she's like "what did I do wrong here??"
Can we trade lives!?
OP, please also enroll the babies in Kumon and SAT prep.  Oh and violin or piano classes.
r/gifsthatstarttoolate
She said fuck them babies let’s play ball 😂
Does anyone know who's dog this is? I've seen this dog and set of pups on reddit but I don't think its the posters
Omg this is like how my older sister DEMANDED my parents give her a little sister (only sister, no brother - which also caused some concerns on their end) to play with, but after I was born she realized that "babies are BORING!" So by the time I could actually play with her she no longer cared LOL
Can I just say how great she looks after just giving birth. Good for her.
Awww such a good mommy . She and the babies are beautiful ❤️❤️❤️
Belly up wants to play.
"They are not yet strong. But soon... Soon, they shall be off FORMIDABLE STRENGTH."
I love this. This is actual Awww right here.
Goldadors?
OP, you NEED to update us when they're big enough to play!
“Why don’t they like what I brought them?” Omgg
Me reading the Hobbit to my 1 year olds.
Follow up vid when they can PLEASE
Why did you purposely take the credit out?
Is there something I can download to turn off schmaltzy background music on these videos? It makes me think that these are less about innocent captures of daily life and more "I've got to produce content for social media."
Awww! This seems like something my dog would do, if she had puppies.
Aww
Your children are never to young for ball training. First they must become familiar with the ball.
That guy on his back!  He’s like “oh hai muma... waz dat gree...yaaaaawn, i’z supah zonkered, nap time now”
She looks so concerned.
Heck this, I slep
The question in her eyes, "why aren't they playing?  What's wrong with my babies?"
"I thought going through the whole birth thing meant I'd at least get to play with them."
what kind of pup?
I love her expression:  My children are defective...they don’t like The Ball.
She looks so sad
Was this stolen from it being posted yesterday
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen in my entire fucking life
This calls for a fresh SCHNOODLE!
Her face is priceless!! Gotta love them!
She’s a pretty pup!!
So small!
She looks so confused about why they aren't playing with her. Aww!
"Do they not understand the ball yet?" 

Give them time
u/savevideo
That's a goal I never thought about, have kids so they can play games with you.
lil baby no ball play
Das a one good mama girl
I didn't realize she was whimpering for them to play because of the dang music! I want a no-music version of this. 😭
English lab? Gorgeous
Aww, she looks so sad
Bless her sweet little heart
I feel this dog! My baby is just about old enough to play with things a bit. I’m so excited that she can do anything! I can’t wait for her to set up and actually play with things!
yo what brand dog is that
Oh my gaaaaawd! I'm literally going to cry!!! 😭
The one with purple color belt is just chilling
That moms expression makes me wanna hug her with those sad eyes
Dog moms turn into puppies again once they have kids lol
Omg so cute

Awwww
This is so precious. I hope we get to see her face when they do finally play with the ball.
Oh my heart! She looks so sad.
Her face says “ oh no, they’re defective :( “
The one little guy lying on his back. Too presh.
The look of concern on her face is gonna make me cry.
I'm not crying, you're crying!
STOP IT! 

IM CRYING
We don’t deserve dogs
That little pup with his belly up is just asking for belly scratches
The mama dog's face- "Why don't then like my ball :("
Thank goodness that shes a doggo if she was a human mother trying to do that ill be upset, she is so innocent.
Gotta start em young
This is the cutest and the saddest thing my eyes could view
Aww she’s really doing her best, please don’t be sad doggo :(
Any of those 8 open for a good home?!? Cute!
Aww it’s so sad, poor dogo. :( I gotta downvote this I’m sorry 😢😢😢
Well to be honest, who hasn’t brought their newborn a ball because you have no idea what to do with them now?
I mean... they’re trying
Beautiful mother and puppies!
You see disappointment in her eyes. Hahaha
This is one of the most awwest things I have ever seen!
That face. So cute.
She’s in shock their not playing with the ball

Aaahw
My heart
What kind of dog do you have? I have one that we rescued from the pound and she looks very similar to your dog.
Thats class
The one on its back lol
This is so damn adorable
When you realize your kids suck
She tried her best but they just stared at lol 😂
The one at the bottom be living his best life
🥺❤️
They'll be running around doing zoomies with the ball in no time, mama. Just be patient.
That's the most pathetic face I've seen a dog make in a long while. If I could speed up time itself ...
Aww, those eyes speak volumes
she looks so sad aww
🥺
Mama dog: (“Madara’s voice” weakness disguise me) 😂😂. I love the the look on her face
Awww 🥺🥺❤
OMGGGGG 😭💖😭💖😭💖
You can never be disappointed in your children too early
Give her a hug!!♥️
Why does she look sad 🥺
What type of dog is that? My pup looks just like her but I don’t know what mine is other than a lab mix? Thanks!
nothing has ever warmed my heart yet broken it at the same time.
I will am willing to nominate myself to play with the sad mother pupper it may be risky but that is a sacrifice i am willing to make.
Oh man look at that belly up buttercup
Please show us a video of her reaction once they can finally play!
Please post updates when she does get to play!
"Why dont they throw the ball?, I wanna play"
What a good momma!!!!
Potats
So fucken cute man. Fuck I love dogs
The one little guy on his back… he’s coming home with me.
Too much pups
"They'll play with you soon right before we sell them for a tidy profit."
Need pupdate when able to play!
I want one..
that one cute puppy and its cute belly just melts you
Awww they're still just squirmy little potats!
Just wait then she will be hiding from them
Aww derpy lil potatoes
"Are they ok? Are they sick? They have to be sick if they dont want to play with *The Ball* right?"
Like my mom when I was a baby. She called the doctor crying telling her that there was something wrong with me because I (1 week old) wasn't playing with any of the toys she got me. Oh, mom.
Labs, always concerned
Isn’t she too tired to play???
Awww
I'm 6 months pregnant. My husband showed this to me and I started crying because of the cuteness.
Why can't the mother dog be with her babies?
She looks so devastated...
We need a follow up video
Of her happily playing with them all.
Baby no like Ball ☹️☹️☹️
Gonna need an update when the pups can play with momma 😊
The one shamelessly shilling for a belly rub put a big smile on my face!
Does anybody know what kind of dog this is(these are)?
Me trying to get my 3 month old to hold his rattle and play with it ... "I feel you dog, I feel you"
My heart ❤️
The dog and the puppies' different colored collars remind me Minecraft tamed wolves.
u/savevideo
This is sooooo freaking adorable! I love it!!! 💗
"Why is nobody having a good time? I specifically requested it."
Omg that’s so cute, it’s like she has a sad face, or as if she’s saying, “I didn’t know!”
It's like when parents show their kid something they loved as kids, and the kid's like, meh.
Am I the only one who sees this as messed up because this dog wants to be with her babies while the dog owner assumes she wants to play. Its naive and cruel.
I read she brought her babies an 8 ball but they're still to little
Much concerned. Very wow.
This is the closest I’ve seen a dog cry
Aww they all have cute collars 🥰
u/savevideo
You take care of em for a while k?
Why aren’t they working... are they broken

This legit might be the cutest fucking shit I’ve ever seen.
Lady imitating dog: “but play with me right now”

Cutest goddamn puppy ever: “oowauh” I swear it’s so goddamn cute
Omg her face. My soul is crushed.
Teaching your Doggo that "ball = play" is actually harder than you think
“What’s wrong with ‘em, Doc?”
Aww
u/savevideo
The dog wants food.  Simple as that.
Saddest dog in the world
I saw this a few days ago
u/DiamondHappy
I needed this post.
OMG, this is precious. ❤️ She tried so hard, she thought she was doing so good! 🥺
Guess there's something wrong with me but that sent me to tears. I've got a lab mix that looks almost identical to this proud but confused mama.
Awe she looks so sad.
Give that one a belly rub!
Feels like the one on it's back tried, but the amount of strength needed to turn around was too much and decided to chill.
She looks so sad
My chihuahua heard you talking and whuff-whuff-whuffed his tiny acknowledgment!
Good Mama.
omg - the mom is cuter than her puppies!!  but don’t tell her that.
Start em young
Adopt dont breed!!/s. We wouldn’t get these videos then
She looks a little concerned. “Is this normal Tall Dog? Are they okay?”
The puppy on it's back kicking the legs... too damn cute.
The mother doggo has tears of joy and happiness
This is tiktok. Unacceptable
The sweetest Momma 🥺
Truth: the dog is sad because the humans take her babies away every, damn, time.
U/vreddit_bot
Lmfao omg that dog is borderline crying cat meme.
That face dude.
Momma looks so sad
Who’s dog is this? I’d love an update

Legend has it that spartan newborn puppies were able to play fetch
Hahaha awwww
what type of dog is this, I want one
The funny part is she was probably forced to have puppies “why did I have puppies if they aren’t even going to play with me”
😍😍 so wholesome
What kind of dog is this? I know it’s a lab but what color?
What kind of dogs are these?  Labs?
...omg...so cute and fluffy puppy’s..
There’s so much shit in the news every single day- seeing this is so refreshing. Thank u!
Oh my heart. Her eyes ♥️
How can you look at this and feel good knowing those puppies will be sold for the breeder's profit and this mother dog will never see her babies again?
This lady got ripped for already having all puppies sold before they can even walk
The pianist can fuck off.
It’s bean dad.
She brought it? Lol -  sure Internet - sure
Maybe I'm projecting but that look on her face says postpartum depression to me. 😅
Is they returded? Y no play wit boll?
This is literally just a repost from not even a week ago. This whole account is just reposts.
So my name is Libby and I often say when I introduce myself that the majority of Libbys I know are dogs
More power to any mother of 8 with the energy to play.
