My parents live on a farm and they have a bunch of hooks on the wall to hang keys for various vehicles and out-buildings.

When they take their old truck out to get supplies, the two dogs usually get to go with them.

You can jiggle any other key-ring on that wall, and those dogs don't care. But if you so much as touch the truck keys, they lose their minds.
My yellow lab could differentiate the sounds of cars. She knew mine, my mom's, my sister's, and the mailman who always gave her treats. Her tail would always start to wag about 30 seconds before the car could be seen. She was pretty confused for about a week when the mailman got a new truck.
That certain crinkle matters.
My dog used to come running from the other side of the house if you so much as peeled a banana.
Meanwhile at my house all I have to do is walk in the general direction of the kitchen and my cat is making a mad dash for his bowl.
I sleep

I sleep

# Real shit??
That's one smart doggo! I mean not that my dogs aren't but they will wake after the firts plastic bag they hear!
Reminds me of me growing up. 

Mom: Hey Take out the garbage 
 
Me: *Has headphones on*

Mom: Did you do your chores??

Me: *Still has headphones on*

Mom: Dinner‚Äôs Read-

Doggo ASMR
My God, I cannot even want to describe how much I love every clip that involve a German Shepard.
German Shepherds have the most ridiculous intelligence. Mine could tell by the squeaks in the floor where I was standing in the pantry, and if I was next to his treat bowl or not. The right floor squeak, he came running.
My dog couldn't hear me yelling at her to stop eating shit from a foot away, but she could hear a cheese string being opened in a closet on another floor.
I used to visit my grand parents every summer when we were kids. One summer, there was a new kitten at our neighbours house, and every time we went to the store to buy some snacks, the cat will come running from the house across the street the moment it hears the crinkle sound of chips packets.
My dog started going def towards the end so I thought I could get away with opening gushers around him. Nope. That dude would stick his head about two seconds after pulling one out the package and start sniffing around till he got right up on them. He‚Äôd pick a gusher out of a room from like 20 feet. I miss Gus more than anything I‚Äôve ever lost!
/r/UnintentionalASMR
This is how I get my dog to come to me if she's being lazy but it's time for a walk. 

She responds to bags of chips.
Classic.  My dog can hear me putting on my walking shoes.
Ears like a hawk!
You can see the dog looking in his peripheral but still funny.
ah yes, the finely tuned instincts of a Snack Predator
Here I am in quarantine and whenever I open a trial mix bag or a dried mango bag my cat runs towards the bag and bites it. At least he knows his containers
Awesome, our cat can distinguish treats from other things to!
My freakin dog can hear a wrapper open while out in the back yard with windows & doors closed. Of course you can call his name forever (unless he wants something) and he'll ignore you. Spoiled Boy.
I love the way a GSD‚Äôs body jiggles a little when they look up while laying down
Doggo sonar is a powerful thing.
I wonder if all of these sounds are completely different to the dog even though they basically sound the same to our human ears.
Side note:  those are my favorite tissues.  A Chinese student left some behind after a summer camp and I still have them.  So many tissues that are just the perfect size.  Wish we had similar packages in the U.S.
Dog:"............................................................................................................................................Na**NI!"**
My dog came running into the room on the last crinkle. 
That last crinkle must hit different for dogs.
My dog just ran in the room because she heard this video
'My, what big ears you have!'


'All the better to hear you with, my dear.'
üêæü¶¥üíú
smart boy
Thats amazingly awesome,  thanks for that.
Me at my desk when people are gossiping vs when my name pops up.
u/vredditdownloader
  My cat would have been over there for any one of them, he's the eternal optimist when it comes to hoping for a snack.
I like how you can see the buddy's eyes moving out of suspicion
Our shepherd/blue heeler always bolted to the door 5 whole minutes before my dad would pull up on the driveway. Champ did that for no one else except my dad. They were besties. Can't wait to see them again üíô
His eyes are open. He's being told to lay down and stay. He's released for the treat bag they want a reaction for. He's a very good boy.... Or girl.
My pups know the sound of me unwrapping an individual cheese stick. They come running every time.
You can see him slyly looking after each crinkle.
My dogs recognize the sound of the drawer in the fridge where the cheese is kept.
"You ain't kitten me"
How did you do that? As soon as I walk to the kitchen my dog is on my heels.
u/vredditdownloader
Treaaaaaats
Reminds me of my husband. Open a can of soda and...nothing. Open a can of beer and he meep-meeps into the room like the Road Runner.
My German only comes when she hears popcorn in the microwave üòπ
[yeh he can see that](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkmNY_jVAAAg6OH.jpg)
We had a cat so greedy that she could tell the sound of the glass chopping board used for chopping meat being lain on the counter vs the wooden ones for chopping veg...from outside.
Hehehe smart doggy
Omg this is perfect!
I was driving by the post office once and my dog lost her shit because she saw the delivery vehicles. I honestly don't know how she recognized them because she can't really see them from my apartment when they're out delivering mail
The dog: No... Still no... YES
This is too real. My dog knows when I open a peanut butter jar from the second floor. I love her.
smell, it's the smell
We had a GSD who could *hear* a banana being peeled.
This is every dog I know. Whoever said animals are stupid never had the joy of living with one.
Any crinkle and my dog is right there waiting. Even non-food items.

In his defense, he was hit by a car before I met him. His brain was surely rattled.
Pretend sleeper
My two dogs can tell the difference in sound between me opening the peanut butter jar (their treats are Kong‚Äôs full of peanut butter) and any other jar in the house. The ONLY time they come running to the kitchen is when the peanut butter is opened.
My dog does the same thing lmao
Meanwhile my cat tries to climb up my leg for anything that sounds even remotely like the treat bag
u/vredditdownloader
*i sleep*

***I WOKE***
My dog can tell the difference of my family's footstep's. He hears my dad? He gets a leash in his mouth and waits for him. He hears me? He sits and waits and acts like a good strong boy to get food. He hears my Mom? He lays down to get a treat. Truly a smart friend
My rabbit is also like this lmao
My ex gf told me my dog could recognize my cars from others when I came home as she would bark and run to the door before I even pulled into the garage
Die laughing, he knows you know which plastic is which. Bish better give me my snack
My cat would sleep like a baby even if there is apocalypse outside  really you can hear firecrakers every second during new year kids screaming out of joy some  loud electronic sounds outside and dishes beign washed but no lady sleeps and sleeps
But just the slightest food sound

Boom not second later and she is right in front of u

She is not fat she is in perfect shape but thats just what all animals do ask for food even if they dont
First two bags: I sleep 
Third bag: real shit?
My friends cat does this shit with the laser pointer. He fucking knows that exact sound of it. It's on a key chain. You can ring your keys around, nothing. But ring they keys with the laser pointer, he will hear it for miles.
My dog is exactly the same. She can tell the difference of what I take out from the fridge.
It's insane how much I relate to this
My cats know which car is mine and what cupboard means food.
whose a good boi tho
This is exactly how my dog is. I don‚Äôt know how they know but they do.  My prenatal vitamins make the same noise as her allergy meds but she never comes when I take them out shake them. When I take out her allergy meds she knows ( I do it soo quiet too!) she gets peanut butter with it so she comes right away. I‚Äôve tested this same time same place.
My dogs know the treat cabinet. I can open every cabinet in my kitchen, but as soon as the treat cabinet is open, they come running.
wow stimulus discrimination
My Eclectus used to fly from the other side of the house, whenever he'd hear me opening a box, where I kept almonds - his favourite treat.
My dog knows specific words and when conversation turns to food. -regular human conversation blaa blaa-chill- "so what are you thinking for dinner?" Then he gets up and stands on you intently looking, slight wag of his tail, what are we having for dinner?" Then if we list specific foods he looses his shit.
this made me laugh so much
What is that crazy huuman up to crumpling all those ba- Snacks?? SNACKS!
My dog (Shepherd mix) does the same, I swear to god. I could open or crumple food packages all day long, but his treats? He knows.
Dogs staring at em the whole time guys.  Still cute
Excellent! Thank you for sharing this.
Smart and smug, idk which is a better description for this big boi
microevolution at work?
r/meIRL
Smart ears lol üòÇ
That's hilarious!!
this is like humans with music.  I guarantee you, everyone has a note, a chord, or a tone that they hear and can immediately associated it with a larger piece of work.  For me, I can hear the first chord of 'Cute Without the E' and immediate known the song.
Lol killer ears!
Very smart doggo
My dogs kkow the difference between snack and non snacks lol
Good boy!
My 14 yr old, mostly blind, dog will hear me quietly sharing a treat with another dog from across the house. It's crazy.
My dog loves it when I pop some popcorn.
Mine knows every sound. He knows the difference in me locking the door and unlocking the door, which set of keys I‚Äôm grabbing, he can even tell if I put a hat on I‚Äôm leaving.
It's gotta be the nose.  Has to be
Adorable
An a cute sense of smell
OP is Pavlov.
My cat does this too when I open a can of whiskas.
Is this ASMR?
My puppers can hear the crinkle of the cheese slice wrapper from *outside*
Shiiiit, my Rottweiler will come a sniffin if I even open the pantry door where his treats are sitting lol.
This is like that game on Mario party where you listen to the 3 similar sounds and then guess which one it was
intelligent dog
u/vredditshare
u/vredditshare
My cat is the same way.

If I can‚Äôt find where he‚Äôs hiding I just jingle those tuna treats and he‚Äôs sprinting.
For my dog it‚Äôs the sound string cheese wrapper. It has its own zesty sound.
Meanwhile guinea pigs scream at anything resembling the sound of plastic bags
It‚Äôs likely the smell, their noses are crazy
When our dog is upstairs I open the dog treats as quite as I can and in seconds upon it opening I here her flying down the steps. Amazing senses
/u/vredditshare
yup..every time
Pavlov
My dogs react to any plastic rustling sound. They are def not this smart!
Reminds me of a Brooklyn 99 episode
What happens when you have a new wrapper he hasn‚Äôt heard before? Will hi investigate or wait until he finds out it‚Äôs treats?
Meanwhile, a neighbour slammed a door, and my guinea pigs started wheeking.
/u/vredditshare
My dogs as well.
Touch 99% of things in the fridge and no reaction. Grab the cheese and I hear both our pups coming from wherever they were in the house. It‚Äôs remarkable.
My cat once got locked in my aunt's room and no one heard her clawing at the door. They open the door that afternoon and she's already pissed at her pillow. Since then, they became careful to check if she's sneaked in before they leave the room and lock it. To check, my aunt would rattle the cat food container and my cat would come running out. But my aunt didn't give her some cat food so the cat learned to wait until she heard the container opening. But then my aunt still wouldn't give her any so she learned to wait until she heard the cat food hit her bowl. Smart cat. Can't say the same for my aunt.
Lol my pup looked up at me when he heard the first one. ü§£
Yup!!
Nani?
Is this asmr?
Good boys always know
This is genuinely fascinating
He knows?
Played this video with volume on. Immediately hear my dog running downstairs
That dog‚Äôs head turned hella fast
German Shepherds are smart. My Rottweiler would have jumped up and eaten the first plastic bag. Then the next day there would be a plastic bag in the back yard with shit all over it.
My cat is like this with her treats. She used to have a tendency for getting out of the house (kids not closing garage door all the way) which occasionally leads to mini heart attacks when I can‚Äôt find her. However all I need to do is shake/crinkle her bag of treats and she presents herself from whatever depths she was hiding in.
That's hilarious!
Ahhh the Taiwanese tissue box toilet paper
My dogs lose their God-given minds over these liver treats I buy at Wal Mart. They're only like $1. It's the only sure fire way I can get their attention fast.
That's Pavlov conditioning for you
My GSDs can tell the difference between vehicles driving by and our vehicles, even if the vehicle driving by is the same make / model as ours. The dogs perked up one day and my roommate wondered if I was home but I had only driven by on my way somewhere else.


It must be one of the things that they associate / learn so well from riding around in our vehicles and is pretty crazy really.
My cat comes running down the hall at mach 2 if it hears something opening with a can opener or something slightly crinkling that isn‚Äôt even remotely edible
Dogs are very good at determining an exact sound. My dogs know exactly which car lock honk belongs to my wife's car, so when they heart it there start to get excited and wait at the door for her to come in.
 If there‚Äôs cheese out.. my dog is there sitting- waiting
It used its peripheral vision. Duh. Didnt you notice it.
My cats know the sound of the drawer the laser pointer is in and will come running from wherever they are in the apartment if you even jungle the handle on the drawer
Me irl
So that‚Äôs why they have giant ears!
My dog isn't that smart. She responds to all crinkle bags.
My dog listens for the deli drawer because he likes cheese.
I want to know why the sound of a can opener brings the cats, even though they have NEVER been fed canned cat food.
You cant fool me human

can confirm, husky sleeping on the couch next to me, woke up to the last bag, hahaha

I love this. My dog takes an anti itch pill with peanut butter everyday so as soon as she hears the pill bottle she comes running lol
You can see his eye looking back to see what it is they're holding lol
Snackadoodles

My old dog could tell when you had a treat behind your back, rip Max
My cat knows the sound of a wet food can over a regular food can
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
My dog can tell when it‚Äôs dad (my husband) in the hallway as opposed to a neighbor. The minute that exterior door opens she‚Äôs losing her shit.
We had a guinea pig years ago, and we kept her food in the laundry room. After a while, it got to the point where every time we opened the laundry room door we could her her squeaking loudly from down the hall.
u/vredditshare
My cat always comes to me when I open the vitamin bottle, she will never learn that rattle is not a snack sound
How?
I'll recreate this video with my lab.
my GSD was in my bed last night, and woke up at 3 am because she heard the footsteps of deer outside and across the street.
My dogs both perked up at the last bag. What is this dog sorcery
Any time you opened the fridge at our house, our GSD would teleport by your side, and stick his nose in with polite, optimistic curiosity.
u/vredditshare
I wish my dog could do this! She‚Äôll come running from the opposite end of the house the second I pick up ANYTHING slightly crinkly; it could be paper, her treat bag, even an empty soda can, she is there and weaving between my legs and my crutch hoping to knock me down and get whatever it is that I‚Äôm holding. I love the little runt, but she is *malicious*.
My cat will run into the kitchen every time I open a pull top can of something because she thinks it‚Äôs wet cat food that we sometimes give her as a treat.
I feel like this is part of genetic muscle memory.  For instance my cat has never been fed out of a can, but every time I even touch the can opener she is at my feet.  The only way I can figure of why she associates that with food is maybe her ancestors were.
I‚Äôve tried this with my dogs and yep it‚Äôs real. 

They can tell which crinkle equals food
This reminds me of the Brooklyn 99 episode where they were calling into the radio station trying to guess the sound of the lid being opened.
My dogs know the exact sound of a cheese string wrapper :/
That is one funky looking dog treat bag
You had my curiosity, now you have my attention.
Still nice to know my cat also knows when I come home and recognises the sound of my car
I miss my German Shepard. Rip boss.
Awesome!
My old cat did the opposite. If she heard _any_ plastic crinkle in the kitchen she was there, in case it was a treat. 

Though, now that I think about it, she also liked to gnaw on plastic bags, so maybe it was just that.
This is exactly how my cat is. I‚Äôve never seen a cat beg for human food the way she does. God forbid she hears a popcorn or tortilla chip bag crinkle anywhere in the house, she‚Äôs sprinting towards you.
Such a cutie
meanwhile my lil doggo came running over at the first crinkle
Before my dog went deaf, she knew what sound the cheese drawer in the fridge sounded like. She would come bounding into the kitchen from anywhere in the house, even if she was out in the back yard.
My cat does this with the laser pointer. Our laser pointer has a little key chain on it that jingles very slightly when it moves around. I can shake my keys, jingle chain, anything that makes a similar sound and she won't budge. The second I move that laser pointer she starts freaking out all excited to catch that fucking red dot...
I didn't see or hear a cheese wrapper.
Love love love this
Is that Pavlov‚Äôs dog?
Lol that face, this is awesome.
My lab knows the difference between me walking to the fridge for milk or grapes or salad and walking to the fridge for cheese. I don‚Äôt know how, but he does.
i like those snacks they taste like it good and all
I wish my dog loved me more than food.
/u/vredditshare 's up

My cat loves the Lazer pointer and it's on a keychain. The cat knows that sound from regular keys, other key chains, any kind of jingles, but KNOWS that pointers jingle and comes running for it

Pom does the same and breaks the sound barrier when it's cheese.
dum little doggo wif its dum little brain
Nice
Look at his Eyes you can see it shifting with each item
Sure, but first, a snack!"
Dog: first you had my attention, now you have my
beautiful dog, great breed too, my fav. Love seeing GSDs in futuristic movies like Terminator
If my ears were that big and there were only like two parts of my day that I got excited about, that would probably be me as well.
Snackos
German shepherds are the best fucking dogs in the world
My dog is not this smart. To him, plastic=snackos. And he will stalk you until he figures out otherwise.
My cat knows the quiet little clacking sound of me picking up a laser pen. At attention before I ever lift it up
Saw the side eyes
That. Is. The. Best!
Super ears activate.
Wow that was so nice... I too had a German Shepherd once
My dog does this with Greenies bags.  I was all excited when I thought I had trained her a word.  Then I figured out it was the bag.  Sad.
That dog is my spirit animal
My cat is like that. Except she can hear electric can opener and somehow can tell if I am opening can of cat food from any other cans. Even if I opened same size can, if it's not cat food she sleeps.
Terry heard a crinkle.
Not surprising considering German shepherds are smarter then the average college student.

Mine just woke up while I played this video and is doing circles now. Thanks.
This shows how much better dogs can hear than humans. To us, these bags all sound like different kinds of plastic bags. Dogs probably can differentiate them even more by what is in them or if they are empty. Just, amazing.
My dog can hear the difference of my mechanical keyboard's escape key from the rest of the keys, and she picks it out because I usually only use it when I'm done gaming and shutting things down or pausing to take her outside
Oh my god absaloutley love it!!
I own that same brand of toilet paper.
Doggo: Food?
Just like my kitty always knows when I'm gonna make a sandwich.  She knows the sound of cold cuts coming out of every package.  Either that or she has sandwich telepathy.
My cat knows when I'm opening the drawer on the fridge that contains cheese
Awww
My dogs could spell frosty paws and wouldn't do anything if it was spelled wrong, the second it was spelled right they would go nuts.
Awww that's such a beautiful dog, how old is it?
This is a great example!
u/Vredditdownloader
I keep my dog‚Äôs treats in a cabinet with paper towels and chip bags and such. When I‚Äôm rustling around any of the plastic wrappings or bags that aren‚Äôt his treats, he pays no attention to the sound. The second I rustle the treat bag you can hear his paws coming thumping at 1,000 miles per hour through the apartment, and then he slides around the corner with his tongue hanging out of the side of my his mouth in anticipation haha. You can‚Äôt trick a good boy.
Very sharp hearing ability.
Not to be that guy but cool
Doggo be like:

My cats come running when they hear me pull their dishes out of the cabinet for a wet food treat.  They're little glass bowls that sound just like all of our other glass dishes (or so I thought).
My dog knows by the clothes we wear what we‚Äôre going to do. If my mom puts on walking shoes and like a tank top my dog will go ballistic

Pavlovian response intensifies.
That sound triggers my anxiety like a stranger whispering to me on an ASMR video.
It seems that cats can do this trick too. We live in a condominium complex with six 4and 5 story buildings. Cars enter and leave all day long.

My wife tells me that the cats jump out of their bed and run to the door about 5 minutes before I walk in.

Apparently, they can distinguish the sound of my car, indoors, on the third story, while sleeping.
Real shit?
I'm sad
Achtung!
This cracked me up. Keen sense there buddy.
The total silence paired with the crinkling gave me misophonia.
The intelligence of doggos is no joke.

Lol same life
My cats do this with laser lights, jingle of the keychain on it and the button click sets them off. But my car keys have no effect.
Ha. My dog knows the sound of a cheese container. Shredded, sliced, doesn't matter. He'll come running.
My little boy don't care what it is...if it crinkles, it's his
Yup our cat is the same way!!
I have a rechargeable laser for my cat, and she knows the exact click of the button. I can push a button on any other electronic and she doesn't care, but she knows that one and comes running.
Our dog loves Little Debbie Oatmeal Creme Pies.  All you have to do is pick one up and she comes running!  One night, she was asleep on the couch in the livingroom.  My son and I were in the basement below her.  My son said "french fry" and she came flying down the steps!  Might I say selective hearing?
What is that white cube
My cats do the same thing with their treat bag vs other things. They also somehow know the difference between me picking up a can of soup or something and me picking up a can of tuna
My grandpa's little jack Russell rat terrier knew exactly what the USPS truck sounded like, to the point where she would start barking her head off long before the truck even came into view of the house
Cats choose #2

CRINKLE WHISPERER
They also distinguish footsteps of family members, no matter how hard you try to "walk differently" its wild. Love dogs so much.

this is pretty amazing ngl
My dog is more optimistic. If it sounds like any person is rustling in any bag she will run to them and sit. I frequent an off leash park where my dog is a mini celebrity because ‚ÄúANY WORD, COME‚Äù and a rustle results in my girl coming to them, sitting, and waiting for her treat.
u/VRedditDownloader
This is really cool
Hahah
smart baby
Why is the dog not looking at the person making the bag noises?
Lol. My damn dog comes running if he hears any crinkling sounds or cutlery on a plate or in a pot.  He's a bloody mooch.
Peripheral Vision
If my dog hears a single crumple of plastic, they just sprint
Perfect lol
My dogs do this when I get cheese or blueberries out of the fridge.
My dog would always some how know someone had touched the cheese packet.

We could we rustling every bag in there ... nothing. The moment I even touch the cheese packet ... boom there he was!
My auntie's cavapoo is like this, except for crab sticks. He can be absolutely out of it snoring and in deep sleep, but if he hears the wrapping of a fish stick he's wide awake and alert, sitting right by you. It's honestly rather impressive.
This also works on me.
Dogs are interesting
u/vredditdownloader
meanwhile our dogs think *every* crinkling piece of plastic contains a treat for them
*Snacc*
Adorable. My cat is almost the same but instead of differentiating the sounds she automatically runs to anything she hears crinkle because she thinks it's gonna be food for her.
It‚Äôs the sound of a banana being peeled for our packüê∂
My german shepherd knows the sound of the cheese string wrapper from a mile away. He comes running wherever he is waiting for a piece to be thrown at him.

Ah fuck it..... Whatever
Yup....our's knows the cheese wrapper.
It's almost like their ears are really good at hearing
I mean......I know what certain packaging sound like too, everyone does if you eat the same thing for long enough.
