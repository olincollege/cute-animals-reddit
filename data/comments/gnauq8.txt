When even dolphins get bored AF while socially distancing...
And thus the Dolphins found religion.
[Sauce](https://7news.com.au/news/wildlife/dolphins-bring-gifts-from-sea-in-apparent-response-to-lack-of-human-interaction-c-1049565) 

>Barry McGovern, an expert in dolphin behaviour, said it was possible the dolphins were giving gifts because they missed humans, but unlikely.

>‚ÄùIn all likelihood, they probably don‚Äôt miss humans per se. They probably miss a free meal and the routine.‚Äù
Dolphins : ‚Äúhey we know you like fucking up this coral shit so we broke some more of it for you! Come play?‚Äù
I hope they don't think we are mad at them
Did the dolphins say that‚Äôs why they are doing it
And lo, after many offerings, the land walkers returned to the shores and boats.

-flippians 3:16
I think this might be how dolphin religions start
This is at my step-grandfather‚Äôs cafe! He organises the dolphin feeding. It‚Äôs at Tin Can Bay, QLD :)
Maybe they are just saying "so long and thanks for all the fish."
I'm sorry! I dont know what I have done wrong!...here is some coral for you...
This will probably get buried, but Australian dolphins may exhibit "gift-giving" behavior, something that's pretty rare in nature. Male Australian dolphins have been known to present sponges to potential mates in an attempt to woo them. They have been spotted wearing the sponges like hats, posing in a "banana-pose," making loud noises at potential mates, teaming up with a wingman, and occasionally chucking the sponge towards the females if they are rejected. 

If you have a chance to read these articles, I highly recommend it:

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-13/dolphins-strike-banana-pose-with-sponge-hats-to-attract-mates/8606264
That is their final gift to us  before they leave. 

The more curious of us have read the tiny print inscribed on the coral. It says;

&#x200B;

 "So long, and thanks for all the fish"
Maybe they're thanking the humans for leaving them the fuck alone.
Maybe they bringing the Covid-19 cure.
Dolphin: "Why have you ghosted me?" :(
I think they're trying to warn us of the impending destruction of the earth and that they're leaving soon.
just when humans stop destroying corals dolphins step up their game.....
Aye, they're missing all the LSD and handjobs
Vegans: playing with dolphins is animal exploitation and they would prefer to be searching for their own meal while fighting predators

Dolphins:
 So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish
Helping us destroy the coral, so thoughtful
Dolphins are social animals just like humans, probably miss their buddies...on a side not, dolphins like humans also have sex for pleasure and not only to procreate...
This seems sufficient to blame the entire collapse of coral, on the dolphins, those vandalising bastards!
Imagine dolphins getting bored in the ocean... whereas there are dolphins caged up in sea world. Can‚Äôt even imagine how bored they must be...
OR missing food given by visitors?
The offerings have begun 

Phase 2 complete

Poor dolphines have no clue what is going on and must think the humans suddenly don't like them anymore so now they try to win back our love with gifts of coral. WE STILL LOVE YOU DOLPHIIIIINNNNNNNSSSS!
That's so sad, they think we don't want to play with them anymore so they're trying to buy our love... Poor dolphins...
Dolphins: The reef is dying thanks to the humans. We must alert them to their crimes and hope they work to make amends. Brothers, let us carry the evidence to them so they can ignore it no longer!

Us: Aww, the dolphins miss us
So no one is going snorkeling at the reefs anymore, the dolphins knew that people liked the reefs, so they brought reefs to attract people. Wildly smart.
‚ÄùOhh look everyone, nature is healing so quickly after we stopped shitting on it constantly!‚Äù

One month later:
"In other news dolphins have decimated coral reefs in an attempt to build underwater monuments to humanity..."

‚Äùfuck..."
Where the fuck is my free food HuMaN!!
Maybe the cure is in the coral!!!?
Be cautious. This is the dolphins equivalent of a white van saying "Free Candy" inside.
They could be bringing us a clue to aid in development of a COVID-19 vaccine as far as I know. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Bro like.... what if dolphins where actually sooooooo smart that their like ‚Äúthis is the cure you need for the pandemic. Use it‚Äù and we‚Äôre all like...‚Äùawww they miss us saying hi!!‚Äù ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
2020: Dolphins have solved COVID, corals are the answer. They keep bringing it to us in hopes we'd use it, but we keep saying AWWW and taking out our iphones. They don't understand why.
Thats just the dolphins trying to be sneaky.

One minute they are giving you coral, the next they are giving you dolphin dick
"Despite those nets of tuna fleets, we thought that most of you were sweet."
Or... the dolphins are bringing gifts of thanks to  all the stay-awayers for finally leaving them the fuck alone.
Same story, different headline:

Dolphins are Destroying Coral Reefs.
Sweet sweet flippys
Or... the coral broke off, they see its dying and they bring it up going "You Seeing This SHIT!?!"
They just want fish not interactions lol this has been debunked but lets roll with the fake cute story.
probably just showing us, how destroyed the corals already are
That's... Not great for the reef...
The dolphins demanded the return of the flesh walkers
Oh good they‚Äôre still here
Dolphins are really smart animals, and I guess that means they get bored too.
do u think that dolphins use coral as currency among each other
So that‚Äôs why the reefs are dying..
They are so smart... once used to humans they get bored without the stimulating human activity!
Omg.. how did they know? Corals are my favorite!
maybe they're letting us know something about this virus.  could coral be the origin and/or treatment/vaccine.
Maybe that's the cure and they're trying to save us! CONSPIRACY!!!
Deep in the ocean, Dolphin's are having emergency summits to see what can be done about the dwindling population of wild humans.
This breaks my heart. Awwwww bless them. They are like ‚Äúthey‚Äôre mad at us! They don‚Äôt want to hang out with us anymore ... they like looking at coral. Maybe we should bring them some coral to remind them...‚Äù It‚Äôs also kinda like humans wanting interaction with animals like deer or squirrels and will offer them corn or nuts üò¢
Okay, the humans aren‚Äôt doing their part anymore. It falls to the second most intelligent species to destroy the Barrier Reef.
Maybe it's their way of saying, "Here are some lovely parting gifts. Now stay out!"
I mean, that's a lot of interpreting but its cute.
"So long and thanks for all the coral." - humans
"The Gods have been silent, perhaps we need to bring an offering"

"Yes Lokfin, fetch the *coral"*
I think they are saying, "Look at this, fix this you pricks, our coral is getting sick can't you tell? Don't you know that if the coral dies we all fucking die? Can you take this to your leaders please? Oh they don't care? Fuck... Alright, climb in, let me hump you before this neighborhood becomes a dead zone."
If we don‚Äôt destroy the coral reefs, the dolphins will do it for us
I‚Äôve heard stories of wild dolphins saving people from drowning. The really do seem like some of the most intelligent animals on the planet
Proof they are puppies of the sea.
They're probably trying to tell us to grind these up and mix them for the Covid 19 cure
I'm both happy and sad that I met a dolphin in a dolphinarium in... Brighton I think. It would have been in the 70's or 80's. They are insanely strong and really agile, and gentle. I was one of the last kids to get to go in the water with them. 

Also, don't keep dolphins in a tank, that's my one big take away.
https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-fake-animal-viral-social-media-posts/
Those aren't gifts...they're funeral wreaths...
To express their condolences to the idiot land-locked mouth-breathers who are going to die from not wearing masks as we begin opening back up.  Dolphins r intelligent.
Aren't dolphins fairly intelligent?
Or they're just trying to lure you in to rape you.
We've must have angered the God's, they no longer give us food we must bring them gifts to appease them.
I love it when humans think they know what animals are thinking and know the intent of their behaviors.
To those wondering if it's a big leap of logic, here's the article:  [https://7news.com.au/news/wildlife/dolphins-bring-gifts-from-sea-in-apparent-response-to-lack-of-human-interaction-c-1049565](https://7news.com.au/news/wildlife/dolphins-bring-gifts-from-sea-in-apparent-response-to-lack-of-human-interaction-c-1049565)   


It's not staged, the items do not harm the dolphins, and it's not against regulations or rules or anything. This is a designated spot for human-dolphin interaction.

They're fed regularly at that spot on the beach. They have brought gifts before, but they bring more now, and larger ones. Most likely explanations are:

1. The dolphins are trying to get attention so that they're fed again.
2. The dolphins are trying to get quid-pro-quo; they often play with these things, so they're essentially bringing us a toy in exchange for food and/or interaction.

In either case, these are gifts. Anthropomorphizing aside, this is a wild pod of dolphins that's reacting to the lack of visitors with gifts, which is touching and cute.
Or they are showing how clean and revitalized the coral is because humans have chilled the f*ck out.
Dolphins in Australia have been bringing gifts of coral to shore ~~because they are missing interacting with visitors~~ TO SHOW PEOPLE THAT THE AQUATIC WORLD IS INDEED DYING
They look like the ones I met in Tin Can bay
What they're actually saying is, "so long and thanks for all the fish."
You got it all wrong OP they‚Äôre giving us gifts to stay the fuck out lmao
The interesting part of this to me is that dolphins have a sence of the worth of items as well as the use of them as gifts.
This how they rape you.
Bored in the sea
Maybe something terrible and unexpected is about to happen to us and they're just saying, "So long and thanks for all the fish."
The cures in the coral
We are sorry, dolphins. We accept your coral.
Ughhhh my heart. I‚Äôll keep you guys company ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
That's a sad aww from me.
I can‚Äôt speak to dogs either
...or maybe coral is just this year‚Äôs dolphin fashion trend.
omg we thought we were destroying the reefs it's been the dolphins all along
Is it really a gift or would we like to think it is ?
"We've run out of things to rape, plz come back" - The Dolphins
I think the dolphins are trying to say, ‚Äúhey humans, look here, you guys killed the plants in my garden, can you please don‚Äôt? And fix this shit.‚Äù
How tf would we know if they miss human interaction.
How the hell do scientists know that?
or hey are showing us bleached corals lol
Or... they‚Äôre like, see what you fucks have done? Will you just stay the fuck out of here now please?
Cuties
Maybe they think that we are doing an environment thing and not going in the water or driving our cars as much so they are bringing coral to say thanks
Maybe they are trying to show us all the coral is dead?
I wonder what the animals with cognitive thinking abilities think of all this...
#is there an up vote all button
What if the coral is a cure to coronavirus? They are trying to tell us something
So long, and thanks for all the coral
THAT'S WHAT'S DeStROYIng thE ReeFS!!!!
Oh the precious babies.
Babe come back, I didn't mean to click at you like that you know I was only playin.
Me:look at it‚Äôs the opposite of heavy
Yeh right.
No one ever reports pessimisticly.

"Dolphins bring coral to humans to raise awareness of the dieing reefs being caused by X,y,z."
Same dolphin in both pictures. Same scar pattern.
How do we know they're gifts? A gift of coral might be the highest insult in dolphin society.
Or maybe they are bringing gifts as a thank you for there being less people.
Can we teach them to bring us junk for attention. #trashtag.
Or maybe they are telling you, look! you are killing the coral, you fucking bastards!
Pretty sure that‚Äôs the same dolphin with 2 different coral gifts.
This makes me feel really bad for some reason. Never met these cuties but..... they think they need to gift us ü•∫
Corals be like ‚Äúwe can never get a fucking break, it‚Äôs either trampling dive tourists or bored ass dolphins‚Äù
They're probably just brining samples of what is known by their deepwater scientists, to cure most illnesses and increase mental capacity.  Stupid humans think they're cute gifts.

The MFers broke one of their prime directives, to not interfere with human self destruction/evolution, risking their lives, and just realized their higher leadership was right.  We're just stupid.
Imagine self conscious dolphins thinking they did something wrong to make us not visit them anymore, so they must buy back our friendship by bringing gifts...
Awww they‚Äôre cargo culting :)
üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
Im not falling for their TRICKS!!! Dolphins only want one thing and its DISGUSTING
Nah they have shells to protect their nose from digging at the bottom of water for food
Dolphins are too nice for us.
Maybe they‚Äôre just clearing dead coral.
Oh...coral...just what I wanted...thanks...
Hurry! Someone tell then it's not their fault!
Since humans stopped going in the water, dolphins now interact with other creatures for immoral porpoises.
And please tell me how anyone actually knows that?
SOMEONE PLAY WITH THE ADORABLE BASTARDS.
*‚ÄùSo long, and thanks for all the fish.‚Äù*
Who know what they‚Äôre thinking?
Actually that‚Äôs just garbage that got tangled on their beaks
It should be illegal to interact with them.
They shouldn't depend on humans for food or affection.
I'm sad, dolphins are like fish people.
It makes me feel kinda good knowing that dolphins like interacting with humans too.
Aww, buddies, we humans miss you too.
Plot twist. Coral is the cure but dolphins don't know how else to tell us.
I don't want to indulge the pretend feelings of "awe they miss us". Humans are exploitive, if something misses us, they don't miss us. they miss groups of creatures desperate for vacation selfies and "sacred animal connections" bringing food.
We are not worthy
Could you imagine receiving a gift of coral from a dolphin? I‚Äôd forever think I was Neptune reincarnated.
Hey! Can human come out to play?
Missing *being fed by visitors
Train them to bring bits of plastic
I hope they don't think we're mad at them :(
I think they are bringing us back the trash we've been dumping in their homes.
This is the sweetest thing I've seen today
That is amazing that Dolphins are so very social
Dolphins are amazing creatures! Never surprised by them.
Or rewarding them for.leaving them alone.
Or hes bringing the coral saying "Please help us save this!"

I dont speak dolphin tho
They don‚Äôt miss human interactions; they just want fish.
It‚Äôs interesting that the dolphins see the coral as a valuable gift that we would like.
If you think most animals mammals on the planet will miss humans if we all disappeared then think again, they won‚Äôt.
Or they're warning us that we're burning the Great Barrier Reef to the ground.
I think the dolphins know more than they tell us. The gifts are farewell gifts.
Dolphriends
Buuuuuuullshit
It's a trick to lure some people and rape them
These photos are so staged. Those poor dolphins are being forced to balance that incredibly sharp coral on their noses.
The gods are displeased with us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So cute! They‚Äôre like, what did we do wrong ü•∫
Nothing "awww" about it. Coral reefs are dying. They may be trying to tell us something.
They bring their offerings to the gods
x to doubt.
That can't be good for the coral.
seems like a big leap to claim they miss interacting with visitors lol
Awe. I love them! Someone needs to tell the dolphins about the plague.
So maybe the decline of coral reefs isn‚Äôt due to warming ocean temperatures, maybe the dolphins are responsible.
Oh! Did they get tired of infanticide and raping each other?
Oh really?  Did the dolphins say this?

Or maybe they are trying to show us what we have done to their environment.
Get this dolphin a person
Yes they do
"Here's a gift, please give snuggles and food again!"
‚ÄúHi hooman! I dont know where your pod went, but our pod misses you very much. We brought you pretty ocean things‚Äù
They are destroying the rest of the coral reefs! üôà
How do we know this isn‚Äôt Italy??
*Pssst! Hey! Dolphin buddy! You see any white or green bricks that fall off a boat you bring them straight to me you hear? I‚Äôll get you any snacks and toys you like, any at all. We got a deal? ;)*
Well go play with them!

It's not like they can get/give Covid-19!
Heartbreaking
how bored is this dolphin
To quote "Ozzy Man" , those dodgy bastards!
Since you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
This upsets me and makes me happy
Don't hurt the corals!!!
Awwww bless them!!
the guy on the left:  "FREE MUSTACHE RIDES!!" 

the girl on the right:  "BEHOLD MY CORAL REPRESENTATION OF 'STRAYA!!"
Please post. I would love to see that.
As Madaline Wunch says when she sees deodorant, im not buying it.
How beautiful
Oh god they need to be stopped
It‚Äôs a trap!!
"You guys that shit here is dying, I need it to breathe, so fix it plx"
So long and thanks for all the fish
Pure things awww
I cant beleive there are people here making jokes. This isnt finny ok? This is serious, stop being such a beach and being shellfish.
Where specifically is this in Australia?
 I vacationed at Tangalooma Island about 20 years ago and remember wild dolphins coming up to eat out of visitors hands.
Aww this is so precious
Needy, just too needy
It's enough to make a grown man cry
This literally made my say ‚Äúaww‚Äù
Or they are being trained as terrorists. Which is just as likely as this anthropomorphic explanation.
Amazing beings.
oh my god my heart.
I feel really bad for the Dolphins now even though they‚Äôre all sociopaths.
i thought this post was going to be about how human destroyed nature and dolphins are stuck in some plastic and stuff like that.
How do you know that‚Äôs why?
‚ÄúBring tribute to the land-walkers! Maybe they will bless us with pets and call us handsome/pretty.‚Äù
I believe they think it‚Äôs their fault üòÇ
How dare you tempt me to break quarantine.
No they‚Äôre not
"We saw how much you love destroying coral, so we brought you this in exchange for your blessings and treats."
I mean, if our pets would just stop coming home one day, we'd try to convince them to come back, as well.
how do you not know they're trying to tell you, "hey look, you've bleached this shit?"
What happened to ‚Äúso long and thanks for all the fish‚Äù? Shouldn‚Äôt have let them back
Don‚Äôt be fooled! They just want to drown your baby. That‚Äôs how they roll (when they‚Äôre not rolling).
Or maybe their offering for us to stay the f@#% away.
Found the article[7news.com.au](https://www.google.com/amp/s/7news.com.au/news/wildlife/dolphins-bring-gifts-from-sea-in-apparent-response-to-lack-of-human-interaction-c-1049565.amp)
InB4 some guy says that dolphins only do this when they are dying
now we don't have to destroy coral reefs by our self, neat.

&#x200B;

/s
Awwww ü•∞
Seems like the oceans dying
So long, and thanks, for all the fish!
wtf
I‚Äôm crying
How do humans know 'why' they are bringing coral to the shore? Maybe they are trying to build a wall.
Arrest them. Lock them up. Coral is a protected species. I'll just readjust my bearskin jacket
they will fly away soon, you‚Äòll see.
And thank us for all the fish.
I mean we humans may be doing our part but these Dolphins are showing no respect for the shrinking coral reefs.
Nice
They are hurting the coral reef...GET UM BOYS!
Dolphins will pick him up, he wants to.
üíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
So the dolphins are now fucking up the coral reefs since the people aren‚Äôt....
You guys did nothing wrong omg !
Dolphins are awesome bros .
What if they are doing this to take over the turf, I mean since sea levels are rising and there are lesser human at the beaches now.
Teach them to bring you shiny things like coins and jewelry
They probably like wtf is going on.  They mad at us .  Blaming some random dolphin lmao
This sounds like an occurrence that happens in a video game lol
How do we know it‚Äôs because they miss interacting with visitors? Maybe they are thanking us for leaving them alone.
An offering to the Gods.
They are saying goodbye with presents. Soon there will be more thanking us for all the fish!
The dolphins near Japan though... they're organizing something else... probably with sharper, pointed coral.
When you wife/Gf gets mad and you have no idea what you did, so you bring gifts to please her.
Aww that makes me sad...
*actual footage of me bringing my friends banana bread*
This is fin üëç
News alert: bio terrorism. Killer dolphins destroying coral reefs.
r/dolphinconspiracy
Things this cool are never true.
I would love to go to Australia and play with them but unlike some, I'm staying inside
A peace offering for a wrong they think they may have done lol.
Came to comment, stayed for the puns - I LOVE you All ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
The only reason to protest against lockdown
Reciprocity
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
they like playing with us.
God damnit dolphins are so smart
Honestly everything is a dog if they dog hard enough.
Omg this is so precious
We don't deserve dolphins
Are we sure this is why?
So long and thanks for all the fish, so sad it had to come to this. 

- Dolphins
this is amazing
If they start bringing lost pirate treasure, Aztec gold coins, or Spanish doubloons let me know.
It's weird how i've never even set foot on their hemisphere but my first thought reading this was "Aww, they miss US?".
Human...look. rising ocean temperatures arw causing the coral to die..... LOOK!!!!
Assholes don't even care about the Great Barrier Reef.
Brother may I have some fish
Aww cute!
Seems like a trap to me
It'd be sad if the deeper reason the dolphins  brought coral was to show humans the dying reefs we have been causing.

"Look human, you're killing our world."
Aren't dolphins the most intelligent form of life on the planet?
Be careful, scientifically speaking, dolphins are known to occasionally be rapist. üò¨ I wish I was joking, there might be some ulterior motives on their minds.
Someone should make an image of this that has the Gordon Ramsay saying, It's Fucking RAW!!!!"
D O U B T
Leave the poor reefs alone ye flippered fucks
Theroy 1.What if they are coral samples with coronavirus infection, and they are trying to reveal the coral is infected as well and so are  they ?

Theory 2. What if the corals have the medical properties to cure coronavirus, and they are attempting to reveal it to humans.
After all the shit that's happened to dolphins because of humans, it's amazing that they still want to be friends.
Dolphins are destroying the coral
So long and thanks for all the fish
"So long, and thanks for all the fish"
Aww. We're never alone.
I still dont like the dolphins. I dont care who they draft or where TB12 is playing.
God damn dolphins fucking up the coral reefs
FAKE all the coral is dead in Australia, AND THAT DOLPHIN IS NEXT!
666th comment!
Oh did the dolphins tell you that?
Is that the same dolphin in both pics? He looks skinnier on the right, but he seems to have the same scars on his head so they're both the same dolphin.
The reefs are dying and they‚Äôre showing us
NOOOOOO YOU CAN"T JUST DESTROY THE CORAL REEEF NOOOO
[Ann Mccaffrey was right!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dolphins_of_Pern)

the dolphins miss us!
Fungee the dolphin in Dingle Ireland was lonely from the lack of tourists so one of the local captains is visiting him in his boat everyday.
I think it‚Äôs bold to assume their intent. Maybe they‚Äôre paying us to stay away and they think it‚Äôs working?
Haha, I love dese boyes
Aww? More like sad. :( Dolphins are feeling sad.
Dolphins hurt corals?
Omg what cuties !
These creatures are treasures that we should do everything to protect. How can you not love these guys?
Nature‚Äôs kindest child
That's cool
What's wrong Lassie? Timmy fell down the well? The oceans heated up and all the coral is bleaching?
Looks like trash to me.
I'm phinnished with this post.
Yes they are bored
Definitely has nothing to do with them being really rapey
Tin can bay!
I actually awwwed as I read that and looked at the pictures!
Those dolphins better behave themselves....
Honestly I have never been more grateful.
So long and thanks for all the fish.
Isn‚Äôt that bad?
Oh man I feel bad now
Some Chinese guy with a small pp sweating right now
Oh nyo
Funny how main stream media blames coral dying because of ‚Äúbleaching‚Äù, but we really know who the real culprits are, big dolphin Is doing some major back room deals.
Did the dolphins tell you that?
Awww....somebody go play with them! They're lonely!
Isn't that illegal?
I mean... Are they though?
It's the dolphin equivalent of offering free candy while dressed as a clown beside your panel van. All they want to do is drag you to their underwater rape cave!
Dolphins realize humans are destroying the planet and join in by ripping coral from the ocean.
not true they are chocking quit polluting waters #recycleForMarinelife #betterPlanet
Because of Covid the ocean is getting a major breather. Dolphins know we been wrecking the Oceans and they're thanking us for taking it easy and really would like us to continue. Any other explanation I see here is insulting their intelligence.
Inst coral.. alive?
That‚Äôs so amazing üòâ, I love ‚ù§Ô∏è it!
They bring us dead Corrals because they think we may help. If we don't help they will take over the world.
Damn and when I try to make friends by sharing cookies they find me suspicious 

I'm jealous of them dolphins ngl
No, they‚Äôre just bringing all the bad shit we humans have caused, like dead corals.
Aww. Poor lonely dolphins üò≠
https://i.imgur.com/CFXupUg.gif
Simpson‚Äôs did it
Maybe they‚Äôve realized the pandemic and it‚Äôs the cure for the Covid..?
That's a pretty stretchy "because".
Actually this is a threat. "We know you humans are worried about coral depletion, come play with us or the corals get it!"
So long and thanks for all the fish.
Is that coral healthy? Maybe its not a gift per se....
How do you know they are missing human interaction? Maybe they are paying respect or saying RIP
[deleted]
Or they are trying to show us the world is healing with us staying out of the water.
I want to pet it.
It‚Äôs sad to think that she thinks just no one wants to hang out anymore.
Maybe they can smell the virus with their ultrasonic mind power and because they know we are having a fuck of a time they are bringing us gifts. Don't cut the dolphins short.
A real cargo cult
"goodbye, and thanks for all the fish"
they are probably more like ‚Äúwhat the fuck is this shit... you killed it all.‚Äù but yea, they miss us.
Maybe the dolphins are saying ‚Äúsee how healthy the ocean can become when you two legged fucks aren‚Äôt around!‚Äù.
The dolphins are sending get well soon cards to humanity.
Uh hey guys...yeah uh...LOOK WHAT YOU FUCKING DID
Dolphins are another creature we don‚Äôt deserve. Cute
I'm going with complicated drug deal...
Dolphins think coral is pretty confirmed
Such amazing animals, it‚Äôs too bad we will eventually destroy their habitats
Is that really what they're doing?
‚ÄúMaybe if we throw trash in THEIR homes, they‚Äôll come back?‚Äù
Why? People suck.
Dolphins are very unique because they are consider mammals. They associate this with humans. Incidents of them saving humans from sharks, helping sailors keep afloat, etc.  Their gifts don‚Äôt surprise me being the wonderful creatures they are.
It soothes my heart hearing that atleast the dolphins are missing me
Corona hitting social lives of all living things
This had me effing melted so I hope it‚Äôs fake
If they knew what it's really like on land, they'd stay far away.
I'm not cryin you are
I too miss interacting with visitors and free samples.     
I‚Äôm all for not over anthropomorphizing, but they are smart and social creatures who likely also came to enjoy going to see the humans, even if the food was the main, original temptation. Is missing that the same as missing them? I know plenty of humans who seem to mostly value others for materialistic or entertainment reasons, can‚Äôt fault a dolphin for being as superficial about friendship as a human.
News Article like four weeks ago : ‚Äúpeople being in quarantine is giving our great coral reefs a chance to heal, now that less people are out destroying them‚Äù

Dolphins now : ‚Äúhold my beer...‚Äù
This is a warning. Corals need our help.
Do you want a dolphin religion? Because this is how dolphins get religion
Dolphins be like: hey we know you love destroying the environment so we did some for you whilst you were away
Hey, dolphins fuck people.
Thanks for all the fish.
Never trust dolphins.
Idk... they could be saying ‚Äúhey without you fking things up we got this stuff growing again‚Äù
Aww, this makes me sad
Ever since I found out they gang rape each other and sometimes rape humans these little guys just aren't the same.
Oh wow, that's pretty dang cool
No you idiots. Coral is the cure to covid.
Nope. They are just showing us how great everything is now that we aren‚Äôt polluting as much
**"Here are pictures of** Dolphins in Australia that have ~~been bringing~~ ~~gifts of~~ **coral on their noses**  ~~because they are missing interacting with visitors~~ **because someone put them on their noses and took photos or who the fuck knows why.**
Ocean cats
Anybody know what humans like?
Headline is BS. Expert says it's unlikely.

That‚Äôs so cute
Either that or they just got stuck in this junk heh
Aww even the dolphins miss interacting with humans
King Snorky has let himself go.
[All hail K!](https://youtu.be/A9sd10CHAP8)
You‚Äôre making some assumptions here.
The water puppies are lonely:(
Did someone feed them cod
God bless these dolphins. How sweet. üò≠‚ô•Ô∏èüëç
We don‚Äôt deserve dolphins
They probably got their beaks stuck in it.
Its a trap!
Little did we know that the the gifts they were bringing us, was the cure for coronavirus.
Maybe the gifts are to encourage us to stay away.
Are all of their blow holes this wide?
but then they would catch the covid and they would have an ocean pandemic and there woudl be a conspiracy and then some would have no idea if they should do something and others would say they should. Then their "leaders" would all run around pointing fingers at each other.

All the while most normal ~~people~~ sea creatures would just go about living a normal life and kind of ignore it all while doing what they felt was safe.But it would all happen in the ocean.
The two of them were excited to see visitors
They've formed a human-based religion around us. Shorelines are their altars.
Ain‚Äôt nobody want that shit!
You‚Äôre lucky. My stupid dolphins only bring back plastic soda holders stuck to their snout. I refuse to take it and they keep whistling at me to accept their gift. I won‚Äôt do it. 

Bring me some coral damn it.
Ohh so we can‚Äôt remove it but they can ü§¨ dam Dolphins
I still don‚Äôt trust ‚Äòem.
You guys had to swim to shore.
You might have something you can be lmao
Yo dawg, I heard you like coral...
Hey Dundee. Didn‚Äôt we used to have a coral reef out yonder?
Even though it says they aren't in the article...
I'll sea them latter
Woah that‚Äôs crazy
Dolphins rape people
Is that why
Dont take candy from a stranger
Hitchhikers Guide was wrong. It's the humans who leave first!
Bullshit
So long, and thanks for all the fish.
Imagine taming them to bring up pearls.
We do not deserve this love
And thus began the sacrifices
This makes me unreasonably sad.
The Dolphins told you this?
How do they even know that's the reason?
That‚Äôs amazing! Dolphins are such awesome mammals.
;-;
üò©
They are sacrificing everything they can to the gods, hoping they'll return.
That fat ass dolphin is hungry
So long! So long, so long!

So long! So long, so long!

And thanks for all the fish!
Has anyone else noticed birds chirping at all hours of the early morning? I heard them at 1:30 am and quite regularly they've been starting at 3:00 am and going all morning. I wonder if they're offering more song in hopes that it brings out the humans.
Just keep swimming
I wonder if they just put the coral on top of their nose and took the photos
And what dolphin told you this?
I'm not crying... you are...üò≠ 

P.s I'm pregnant
Dolphins are the ones killing the reefs!
Here's some gifts of coral to thank you for staying out of our ocean.
So long and thanks for all the fish!
*Awww :(*
Dolphins probably think we're stupid as fuk
That shows how intelligent their or can we find out is there any anything their trying to say?
Fucking hell, now the *dolphins* are destroying the reef?
Is no one else concerned for the coral?
If this is Monkey Mia may I say it is the strangest experience with animals I have ever witnessed.
[deleted]
Where the fuck are the fish?
Man Corona is making dolphins sad...
Man Corona is making dolphins sad...
this just further proves my point that dolphins are the best sea creture
RRRRRRRRRRRR.... WE RLOVE RYOUUUUUUUU....
Or maybe people throw them fish and they're hungry because the waters have been overfished already
Just why
This is fliptastic
Tin Can Bay. Love that place, was there in December and it was one of the most amazing experiences of my life
Maybe they just miss that sweet sweet human ass. After all, dolphins rape!
The dolphin miss free food
Is this real or did some asshole throw a price of coral in a dolphin
That‚Äôs absolutely wonderful!!!
Jotaro approves
Does this mean than we can blame the destruction of coral reefs on dolphins now? Are we off the hook?
We need to send a diver or two down with a gift in return. That would be the decent thing to do.
I don‚Äôt sea it.
This makes me unbelievably sad...
Wet are we trying to accomplish here?
Stop breaking the coral you dinguses!
Human: destroys coral. 
Other human: omg that is so bad.
Dolphin: destroys coral
Humans: omg how cute they miss people!
THis is probably part of the dolphin's plan to hasten global warming.
"Can I offer you some coral in these trying times?"
DOLPHINS or just his particular dolphin?
I wonder why they're specifically bringing out coral?
If this goes on long enough coral reefs will spread!
Sounds like what my cat does every night üòÇ
*Jotaro intensifies*
We don‚Äôt know what they are feeling, but I do like this interpretation.
Yes, please us gods and we will let you have fun with us, BRING MORE CORAL SACRIFICES
Aww the doggos of the ocean
so the dolphins are also killing the reefs!
So long and thanks for all the covid
They stole those corals. Smooth criminals.
This can‚Äôt be for real, internet.
Cough, bullshit, cough cough
I‚Äôve been wondering how pigeons and seagulls have been fairing with all the free handouts and dropped food gone.
Dolphinately on porpise.
WOW!!! this is amazing\]
So cute
So long and thanks for all the fish turned into, where‚Äôd ya go and where‚Äôs all the free fish!?
This is amazing
Don‚Äôt bring that dead ass coral ashore like it‚Äôs our fault it died, we‚Äôve all been home for a month
Omfg I love dolphins even more now
Maybe they took an online business class?
I've always been very on the fence about travelling, at least with respect to the environmental impacts of flying, and especially with respects to shady "tourist" practices that rely pretty heavily on exploitation...

That said, goddamn, I wanna go somewhere and play with a dolphin.
I just imagine dolphins going ‚Äúthey didn‚Äôt come back for the pink swirly one?! But that one was perfect!‚Äù
And now I'm crying.
Aw, coral = undersea flowers
Coral is like gold in their eyes
I want to keep all the dolphins company üê¨
 Awwwwwü•∫
I‚Äôll go see them
This makes me cry
This is actually bait. Dolphins are notorious pedophiles and rapists
Hungry
This thread just jumped the shark...
They don't miss us there saying that we're fucking up the corals and bringing us evidence.
Feeding them is super illegal in Aus if I recall, so they are not conditioned for food hand outs. Which makes this pretty neat, 'wild' animals are going out of their way to interact with humans for fun. Nifty!
r/petthedamndolphin
He‚Äôs like ‚Äúy‚Äôall done killing us now?‚Äù
Look at the markings on it...that‚Äôs the same dolphin in both pics
"Is it something I said?? *Brenda please!* ***sPeAK to ME***"
That's so sadüò¢
Is it dead coral? What if they are like. "Yo fuck heads, fix this!"
Is this facts?
Good picture. I like.
Maybe Douglas Adams had it correct and the dolphins are checking to make sure we haven't left.
Ummmm so where exactly is this? Are there any Aussies I could come crash with just so we can hang with dolphins to give them pets?
Happy jotaro noises
Are they doing it on porpoise?
Ngl this is probably true, because dolphins can become  emotionally attached to humans and other animals, just like dogs.
It should speak volumes that the coral is bleached
or maybe theyre trying to tell humans to stop fucking up their environment considering the great barrier reef is dead
Dolphins in Florida are strapping up.
NOOOOO NOT THE SPS!!!

The coral the dolphin brought is a type of coral that is notoriously hard/expensive to grow in the home aquarium, and it pains me to see it like this lol
Nah they‚Äôre bringing coral to the shore to show humans ‚Äòhey look, see what happens when you don‚Äôt pollute, the ocean gets fixed!‚Äô
It is cute but, the same time it is so sad.
ppls love coral that I know
Gotta get to the beach more often.
I hope this gets remedied quickly. Dolphins are very helpful to humans.
