*Hey.... uhh yeah thanks for making a spot for me! I’m just gonna... just gonna lay right here...*
OK, we are going to have to make the best of this.
This is how I get in my bed when my cat's in it too.
[deleted]
Mals have the best demeanor.  Love them!
I haven't verbally *aww'd* like this in quite some time.
"Excuse... sorry (oof) don't mean to do a disturb... I'll just - ok - this fine."
r/stolendogbeds
Funny how the cat sleeps right in the middle
*Cat looks over at human*


"Are you seeing this shit?!?!?"
That cat was tipping it's head up hello. I think he was hoping to get spooned, then he got the cold shoulder. Wahwah.
Huskies they are ether nice gentle creatures, hyper crazy, or threatening you with a knife.
We have a pretty big scottish deerhoud and he's the same, he wouldn't hurt a fly.
I find it interesting, dogs and cats don't have this concept of "you're in my space", they step on you and walk over you and lay on you and it never occurs to them to move you. It must be weird to be told by a human to move off the couch so they can sit down and not think much of it and not emulate that behavior.
I love this pup way more than 90% of all people I have met. *melted*
What a sweet boy.

And of course the cat looks at him like, “yes, can I help you”.
Kitty loves that doggie. See the way she turns up her neck to doggie? Wuv and complete trust..
Dogs can co-exist with cats!
Awww. In my house we call it, “It’s ok, I’m a little Bud Bud”. My dog Buddy working around a cat in his bed. He will miraculously curl up into a tiny dog form to not disturb. I love him more for it!
Give that good boi a big pet for sharing his bed so nicely!
What a sweet polite boy!  So sweet!
Not impressive. That’s how I sleep every night with my wife.
Cats have an amazing talent for taking up an entire bed.
You know that gentle giant is too sleepy to even bother who occupied his bed
I have no room, no covers, and can't do a DAMN thing about. I am literally on the edge of the bed. Yet my husband complains about not having enough space. We had two large dogs (RIP, Kahlua), and they did make sure *they* were comfy. My husband and remaining pupper still do. But somehow I got blamed with the mattress seam burned into my face.
Careful positional compromise.
[deleted]
Is that bed from Costco?
Aww
Aww
I admire his attitude
What a sweetie 💕🐩🙋🏼‍♀️
Malamutes are awesome.  Well except for the fur.  Fur everywhere all the time, but great dogs.  Best of luck to anything that wants to threaten your family, cause that dog is fully capable of fucking somebody up and dragging them to the backyard to bury them when it is over.
Awwww, bless it!! 🐾💞🐾
God I love dogs.
Wow, so kind.
cuties <3
This is me getting into my human bed when my dog is occupying it
Aw. I don't know the specific situation here, but our cat Peaches and our dog Bo (big lab) used to do this dance all the time. That kitty looked at big dog the same way Peaches looked at Bo. Peaches and Bo always slept on the same bed. Just depended on who got there first. More "I got top bunk!" than anything in our situation. This was a nice reminder. Thanks OP
A gentle soul
This is why I love dog. They always did unexpected things and sometimes make people touched! So cute!!
My heart is melting
such a sweet boiii🥺🥺
He looks so dejected.  Like, he’s had a hard day and just wants to sit in his favorite chair, but can’t because one of the kids is there reading a book.
 BOSS CAT
He reminds me of Seth Rogan
Anyone know what kind of dog beds those are? Sure look comfortable and large too.
How come when he does it the cats all cool with it. But I try this with my cat and he grunts and runs off.
Whatagoodboi!
r/stolendogbeds
Where can I buy a dog bed like that? Need one...the ones on amazon are craptacular
This was me last night except I'm not a giant but still the cat in our house took over my entire bed. I woke up with cramped legs
Is the red fur on the adjoining dog bed a dog? If so, they have TWO giants!
This kind of thing happened a lot with my family cat and dog while the dog was still alive. \*sniff\* I miss him...
He looks like an older puppers, you can see the effort he is taking to sit down so gingerly
Time to get another bed!
That’s what my dog used to do with my old cat before the cat died
It’s okay! I will lie down just here. Aww.
"What the...this fucking cat!...sigh...not worth the trouble."
My heart. It’s melting. Help.
r/stolendogbeds
Move, kitty. Let the old man lay down.
Cats truly don’t give a fuck.
He's so gentle 😍
This is such a cat thing to do. Little assholes stealing beds. That’s why they aren’t “man’s best friend”.
We truly dont deserve dogs
u/chickennuggetfeet
My dog would have just smashed the cat without even a second thought
I loved how the doggie didn't even mind that his bed was occupied like that was one of the cutest and nicest moments :)
Cats are jerks.
Lol, Cats are such assholes.
I feel bad the dog got his spot taken and is too nice to sit on the cat.
Some see a generous dog, others see a selfish cat.   I think I see a selfish cat. How hard is it to scoot over?
I love how they both passive-aggressively pin their ears. 😂
"uhm, excuse me. Mr. Cat? That's my bed..."
A near-ancient meme but it checks out
This is my bf when I’m asleep
A gentle giant who has felt the nails of a cat before.
All these posts on here make me depressed that my roommate claims he’s allergic to dogs and cats :(
I love them so much
What a sweet, sweet gentle giant.
It just scares me how much this reminds me of myself and my dog.
😍
Cat to dog: LOOK AT ME! I am the Captain now.
Move the cat !
Learned not to approach from behind.
This looks exactly like my dog! I guess he must be a malamute instead of a husky since he's 87lbs
noooo he s like "... I got no home... maybe... maybe I can use this little spot..."
could've curled around kitty to make it even better.
What breed of dog is that? Husky?
Hey, what a great dog.
You lay there and I lay here. Cuddle time!!
This is me trying to sneak into my parents bed when i was little thinking they wouldnt notice. They knew.
CUTE
Seems like everything on this planet can share except humans
Aww!
Such a sweet baby I wanna cuddle
You see gentle giant I see small bully
Ho no no no. .
bitesizedickydevilfish
Can you...just scoot over...a little
It acts more than a human.
Every movement was deliberate
What kind of dog is that?
This shows a cats and a dogs personality perfectly and I love it!
u/vreddit_bot
Cat doesn’t even know how cuddly it is to curl up in the middle of a malamute.
They'll have a new fear of giant frogs.
Beastars
Cat: I ain't moving bitch.
He is SOOOOOO ***Cute***
This is my wife with our 15 year old cat Indy. It frustrates me to no end but I also completely understand.
That cat is such a Karen. I was here first, I’m not moving!
r/stolendogbeds
I like how animals compromise.
Ah, just like me and my Ex.
"I gave up the wild for this."
The ears say it all
GoodBoy 100
Dog "What the fuck?"

Cat looking up "Will you lay down already"
Just like me and my partner.
I secretly always wish for the dogs to make a scene and claim what’s theirs again
u/vredditdownloader
Lmao what is this, A crossover episode?
The best thing about this is that dogs are naturally territorial. So he literally went against his nature right there.
Thats the power of kitty...the power of kitty compels you to bow in front of me and secure the smallest part of your bed...
Aww
Bless
My hound dog and my cat from way back when would both just move so they could snuggle together. My hound grew up around my cats.
u/vredditdownloader
good demeanor.
What a gent!
Goodest of boys.
Wow. Of course this will get buried in the comments, but this looks exactly like my family dog Mojo, who just passed away a couple days ago. He was just as sweet.
Reminds me of me and my X.
He looks like a wolf
They need and extra bed ASAP
Cat gets pissed at the end. Peep the ears.
Fukn cats!

They've been genetically hardwired to perch in the very spot that maximises their footprint, I swear!!!
What a good boi
... of course that cat moved like five to ten seconds later, right?
*sad doggo noises*
is this a mother fucker beastars reference.??
“Looks like we’re sharing”
huch
This is me when my cat lays in the middle of my bed.
It’s literally me going to bed while my cat is already there.
I can’t get over how clean everything is.
Such a sweet dog
#Legoshi is best boi
"Answer "if you know ur worth,u have nothing to prove to people
Class act
This dog is just me with my cat
Malamutes are the best. I’ve got one that just turned 1 and he is the most awesome dog ever. Wants to do literally everything with me and snuggle 24/7.
What breed is the Cat?
Haha the cat couldnt care any less
I like how the cat looks at the dog like "well, you gonna lay down or what?"
Cat: aight what chu doin here!

What they’re thinking: *oh fuck he’s huge why did I decide to nap here*
Thats how the little ones do too. My sister 12lb yorkie poo lays diagonally somehow managing to take up two thirds of a queens size bed.
AWWW!🧡
He seemed quite disappointed at first not to have his spot
SSO ADORABLE
My brother used to bring his cat to our house and this would happen except also imagine the opposite.. my dog would be squeezed into the cats bed. Sides bulging. He looked ridiculous and I loved it.
So cute 😍
Same look on my face when I tried finding a spot to sleep at a house party in college..
Why don’t you buy an extra one for the cat for obvious reasons
Meanwhile my adorable pupper thinks that everything he can see is his. My lap when I'm sitting down cross-legged on the floor? His now.
My 80lb choco lab/pit mix will sit on the hard floor and cry at me when I keep my mom's 4lb chihuahua and they sit in her bed.  If I don't do anything about it my large dog tries to cozy up in an 18 inch bed because she is too scared to try sharing or taking her's back.
My cat does the same but he pees on my dogs bed. And then my dog cries and we have to throw it out.
This is why I'm a dog person and not a cat one. I got no time for entitled arseholes.
It’s like me in childhood trying not to wake parents up in 3am but failing
😂😂😂
He is sitting so quietly and smoothly. Respect that dog😍
This dog is nicer than most people lol.
cute
She sho shweet
Mom no like when I squish bitchy kitty
Aww
My Mastiff would play lawn darts with the cat. We tolerate them on the farm and we built safe shelter for them out of 55 gal drums but a cat on his bed would just be a step too far.
Reminds me so much of Legosi. Such a good boi!
Our dearly departed Alaskan Malamute looks exactly like him and he’s just as gentle.
My dogs learned very young to respect the cat and my German Shephard would have been beside herself with joy if the cat ever deemed her worthy enough to share a bed with.
Soooo cute !!!
If he was a giant cat, he would have juz plonked himself right on top of the intruder!
Of course the cat is right in the middle lol. So cute!
What a gentleman
We can share
All I see is a snuggle pile.
What a beautiful soul.
What is the breed? Husky?
My cat would have attacked the dog and then sleep on the floor, not letting doggie to sleep on the bed.
My cat loves to assert dominance.
The very reason cat is the spawn result of satan
My cat looks exactly like yours
I would buy him 3 no, 4 dog beds just so he can have it all. :C
Aww he’s so polite and the cats just scowling at him
Awwwww
Thats husband and wife.
The little blinky observational scan left and right “should I settle in here..  or here..”
I'm extremely curious when that was taken. I have a cat with the exact same fur pattern and brown fur below the chin, and a few years ago before I adopted her she had a foster home, I just wanna know..
So sweet and gentle. They seem to be true friends.
I would’ve yeeted the cat for my bud.
Gentle maybe, but the lbp (leaning back pressure) of a curled up dog that weighs over 50 lbs can reach a psi of 900.
BABY
this is why the Starks lost too gentle
"Cats - their ways are strange... they'll never change..."
"Odd" is such a gentle word
u/VredditDownloader
This is you and the cat is your wife/girlfriend when you did some shit like didn’t take out the trash or forgot to put the toilet seat up, plus periods.
If that was a real wolf, alpha or no alpha, he'd have eaten that cat and plopped himself right in the center of that seat.
Me with my dog when she takes up 75% of my bed.
The ears say it all.
improvise. adapt. overcome. 

Also though I just love how the cat looks up like “hey man” haha

r/MadeMeSmile
Can't tell if it's an old soul or a tired soul... tired of the cat's shit.
DAAAAD! THERE IS SOMETHING ON MY BED!... NO IT’S SMOL AND FUZZY... DAD IT WON’T MAKE SPACE I WANNA SLEEP ON MY BED. DAAAAD!! NO HE WON’T LISTEN TO ME
Gud motivation
Stupid cats.
Cat: Oh hey! I'm so sorry, I fell asleep... I can get up if you......

Dog: No,nooo... Its fine, you stay there, there is plenty... *grunt*... Of room right here...
Why did I think he was going to be big spoon?
I don't really blame the cat; too comfortable. But the dog certainly deserves a nice space.
Hahaha a gentleman in love ♡
these are my pet goals
Well to be fair the Catto is definitely bigger than Doggo so it needs more space
Reeeepoooossttttt
This is me when I go to bed and my SO is already sleeping.
This is the same cat that wouldn’t let the leg leave the bed on the left
I know the feeling.. ☹️
Giant indeed.  His back is almost level with the table.
u/VredditDownloader
D'awww... "I'll just go ahead and share with cute little ball of fur and fangs."
Yep..bring it on!
That is me when I get up to go pee in middle of night and come back and my cat decided to move right in the middle of where I was.
That is one very gentle giant
Dog: 'This is fine."
What a sweetheart ❤️
That is such a cat thing to do.
Is that a wolf?
I love you 💕
Watching such video with someone suddenly shouting is frightening..
*.....but...where, do I sleep?*
That's me when I go to sleep after gaming night and bae already in bed
My cat sleeps in my bed when I get up. I feel the doggo and like him I dont move her. :/
There’s another bed to the left, I think pup just wanted a snuggle.
Awwww this reminds me of the scene where Timon and Pumba go to their “own” beds. ❤️❤️

https://youtu.be/0XSRQm7Vt3k
Cats and dogs. I just love them so much.
How does the op has 6.5 millions karma ?!? In one year ... But f*** I love malamute ( or husky, both)
Maybe he's just afraid of the cat.
Would this be a cast of "Finders Keepers" or "If I fit, I sit"?
“Oh, dear. What to do?”
Is this my dog? Does my dog have a second family?
Typical tuxedo behavior...
Don't disturb the Tamanian Devil , *too much*.
Me trying to get comfy around my cat at night. Oh, the edge of the bed is all that's left? Perfect! Thanks!
Hahahahaha my cat does that to me... with my own bed. I wake up in the morning completely pushed to the edge...
What a sweetheart!
I like how the dog is 4 times bigger and could easily reclaim that space but doesn't because he respects others.
Yeah except he's not giant. My dog is 165 lbs.
Ahh the good old “I’m going to lay down next to him so he goes away” move
*this is my life now*

So wholesome! <3
"Wait... What? Aw c'mon! Dammit... I gave up the Wolfpack for *this*?"
a vida como ela é kkkkk
My cat does the same thing with my dog’s bed, but my dog just finds another spot to sleep
Someone get that dog a new bugger bed 😍
St the end the cat is like, Really. You just HAVE to lay here.
is the dog a collie/sheppard?  Looks like a gentle giant who was part of my family. boy, do I miss him
Holy heck is that a wolf dog hold on *clears throat and puts on Karen wig*
Do your local law enforcement know about you keeping such a DANGEROUS animal keep that CREATURE away from my kids! What you won’t get rid of him? IM CALLING THE POLICE AND TELLING THEM YOU PUT A DANGEROUS ANIMAL ON ME.*clears throat and bins Karen wig*
I didn’t actually think all the Karen bit just thought it would be funny he is beautiful is he a wolf doggo tho I love them
He do be lookin sad though
Good pupper! My cat does this and my dog will just lay next to the bed.
I swear, the bigger they physically are, the bigger cowards they are, at least towards cats
u/vredditdownloader
Just like my house
I wish I could watch another half an hour of this; I just want to see them settle in.
wish my cats and dogs were like this
u/vredditdownloader
That cat is such an asshole
loll love big dogs
Very cute🥺💓
Imagine ppl in public transport.
Most cats would hate that much husky oil smell, unless that bed is new or just washed.
Anyone know were you can buy those dog beds?
This is me when my gf went to bed before me
This was my cat he would go to the middle of my dogs beds curl up and when the dog came to lie down stretch out
this dog was like acted like a mother...so selfless
Lol my husky would be annoyed by that and look at me as if im gonna do something about it.
How does one train a husky/malamute to not freak out and chase the cat every time it becomes aware of its presence????
u/vredditdownloader
My dog would have just sat right on top of the cat. She wouldn't take any crap when it came to her bed.
I love how he was so willing to accommodate the cat.
*Gently chews the occupant*
He really thinkin about how to not disturb  that cat
What a sweetheart! 💖💖💖
Cats happy to cuddle but then like, “man, this oaf dont know the art of kitty snuggling.”
When your homie needs a hug:
I wouldn't be surprised if there had some previous 'incidences'. I've had cats that have had furious battles over sleeping spots. And cats that will set a dog straight with no fear. Those poor dogs and their 'WTF the happened' reaction.
Someone move that damn cat!!!
Doggo part wolf/coyote (Doggo HUGE)
The cat is pissed at the “intruder”.
I thought he was gonna sit on the cat for a minute 😂
r/stolendogbeds
u/vredditdownloader
what a babey!!!!! deserves all the kisses
Support your dog. Move the cat.
*everyone liked that*
I love how he could have easily bent with the curvature of the bed right next to the cat, but instead, he lays on top of half of the cat. Lmao.
Where is his giant sword
So nobody else wondering what kind of wild ass wolf is that?
Even he knows you never move the cat
Love those Costco beds
Aww hecc fren, catto has done a hijack
My dad when 2 year old me slept on his side of the bed.
That cat owns the dog.
"aaww, thank you for keeping it warm for me"

"YOUR SPOT IS THE COLD ONE ON THE EDGE, KNAVE!"
does anyone know what kind of dog beds those are?
What breed Is that dog
This looks exactly like my dog just a little bigger. I thought my guy was a German shepherd husky mix. What’s this guy?
Husky: *That wasn't very cash money of you*
It’s not his bed in the dogs thought. It’s the packs bed and the cat is family.
u/Vredditdownloader
What it's like getting into bed with my wife
I hear a Ludacris song in my head
This dog looks and acts SO MUCH like my old dog did. Thank you for the video, it brought back a lot of wonderful memories!
Dogs!! :(
I am fucking bawling my eyes out
My dog would just attack the cat
....ezzactly why I'm a dog person. Cats are suchhhh assholes
cat: “.... hi fwem” 

dog: “hi fwem”
Kick away that fucking cat.
Bless this adorable house wolf.
I've seen why too many of these videos on Reddit. Do pet owners do this for karma or do they actively let the cat bully the dog? Or why don't pet owners just buy the can another bed and let the poor dogs sleep in peace.
Wow. Nice 👍🏻 guy giant
He looks so sad and confused.
My dog would chase the cat away. Problem solved.
Most important rule: You never ever move a sleeping or relaxing cat, whether you're a human or a dog.
This cat is really boss. I like cats more than dogs. My cat is red and my dog is red too
That dog is just a wuss, look at his tail
I’m surprised the dog didn’t Yeet the cat
Feel so bad for the pupper. Cats are mostly assholes. 🤣
Admit it... he's terrified of the cat.
Shameful disrespect. He should have given her a little nudge or something.
That...is a fucking wolf
Reposts. Reposts everywhere
Why do cat's always do such inconsiderate things to dogs and dogs are always surprisingly gentle with cats relative to size.

I remember my Rough Collie got his face smacked by a cat that he just walked past and he looked at the cat with a "What the fuck did I do to you , you little bastard!" 

Was so hilarious when you see the size difference. I wished I could have taken a video of that moment.

RIP to him now. 💔👼
