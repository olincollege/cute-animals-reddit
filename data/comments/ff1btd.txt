Such a sweet boy
Omg his stumble-jog is too much for me, I love old dogs
The dog my family got as a puppy when I was 16 recently passed :( I don‚Äôt want to be sad on this post because it warmed my heart seeing your dog come to you!! Our dog would and then when she couldn‚Äôt she‚Äôd still be wagging her tail and staring at you as she laid down. But for almost a year my dad was giving her some supplement made for dogs with CBD and it seemed to help her manage pain. She was a lab and her hip issues got to be too much. My parents had a harness to help her walk up and down the stairs to go out and my dad and brother would carry her when they could (that was too much for my mom). My parents held onto her for so long because she still seemed so happy. 

I will delete this if it‚Äôs too sad. Dogs are just amazing and we don‚Äôt deserve them!! But they still love us. I can tell your pup loves you so, so much. Maybe CBD can help too if his legs are hurting at all.
Massaging their joints for several minutes in the morning helps their flexibility! It‚Äôs also great bonding time.
We don‚Äôt deserve them. He hobbled and did his best just to say hello to you. It‚Äôs pretty phenomenal how much they love us.
He's beautiful!
Dear god that‚Äôs just too much for me
Dogs really are like one of the family rather than a pet
You sure did put the pep in Old Boi's step. He's so happy to greet you
Angel
Next time go to him pls ‚òπ‚òπ‚òπ hes earned it for being such a good boi
Awe puppers!! What a guy!
How old is your pup? My boy is almost 11.
Respect to our nation‚Äôs senior citizens
That‚Äôs true love right there.
This legit made me tear up, it was that sweet. Dogs are absolute heaven on Earth...
Aww buddy... those hips gotta be sore.
What a sweet doggo! This may even belong to r/zoomies
See if you can get some doggie CBD for him and his joints
I don't know if your old dog is suffering from arthritis or something else, BUT... When my lab started to show those symptoms I started him on Dasaquin. After three weeks I noticed a REMARKABLE increase in his mobility. He's been on it for two years now and you'd never know.
It's kinda of expensive and if you stop for a month symptoms all come back, but the three dogs I've been responsible for putting on it are all doing MUCH better than they were.
Why can‚Äôt dogs live longer it‚Äôs not fair
 If you're not already giving him a joint supplement like Cosequin, you should seriously consider it. It's cheap and makes a huge improvement in their mobility... especially in senior dogs. It's a great $15/ month investment in your best friend.
Something about an old golden retriever just warms my heart.
Oh that poor baby does he have dysplasia? So pretty
Senior pets are my favorite. No animals love more.
As I lay beside my old hobbling dog scrolling through reddit, this catches my eye and makes me shed a tear. We do not deserve dogs.
the most bittersweet part of this beautiful moment is noticing the decline in the old pupper‚Äôs physical movement but the same excitement since day one to see their owner. even after all the years. you can‚Äôt buy that sort of genuine commitment.
Sorry for being negative, I too am overcome with cuteness, but you folks realize he's in a lot of pain?

Old dogs are amazing, but when he can hardly move... I don't know. I feel like my last dog lived for too long. It's part of the responsibility of caring for a pet, but I kept putting it off. Years later I still think about it and feel bad. Like, it's not right when a dog can't dog, properly anyway. That's just how I feel, not judging. He looks very happy.
Old dogs are the absolute best
Sweet bronco!
Awe, he's an old boi but will still do anything for his favorite biped!
This video actually makes me sad...poor guy must be in quite a bit of pain :(
This is the purest thing ever
I‚Äôm in love with the handsome boy.
I love them both. A pair of esteemed gentlemen of course!
Such a sweet old man
Reminds me of that scene from the Odyssey when Odysseus returns. No one recognizes him except for his old dog who stayed alive long enough to experience his return.
My dog has gotten real old real fast. You‚Äôre never ready for it, and the change will never happen over night, but then suddenly, one day, your dog/ cat/ anything will take a little longer to get up the stairs, need a little boost to get up on the bed, go fetch that stick a little more leisurely than usual, or call it quits on the walk a block earlier than he used to. 

And then, one day, your dog will be old, and you‚Äôll be left wondering how it happened so fast. And how quickly they grow up. You just have to cherish every single second you have with your furry friend. 

Sorry, I don‚Äôt mean to drag the vibe down, but this has happened with my black lab. I‚Äôm just kinda thinking out loud here. He got so old so quickly, it seems, and you‚Äôre left thinking ‚Äúhow did this dog, who was so full of energy what seems like only yesterday, get so old, so quickly.‚Äù It all happens so fast. Way faster than anyone will ever want. 

I made myself cry typing this lol I‚Äôm so sorry. Just love my dogs so fuckin much. I‚Äôm sure we all feel the same. So hard to see our little loved ones get old.
God its so painful to let them go, but the joy they bring is incomparable to anything
That was so adorable. I love this.
Sure he's not in pain? :(
That's not when he saw you - that's probably when he smelled you.

Still, very cute nonetheless.
Liked their particular way of walking.
How old is he ?
So incredibly precious!  Thank you so much for sharing!
Bring him to the sea and let him float on the water just once.
My female pit is turning 16 in May, pits were my choice of breed, took her in as a gift and never had such an amorous and loving dog.  We walk/run 1-1 1/2 miles daily, she loves it.
I love your old boy. He's adorable. But it hurts me to watch. I want to gently pet him and tell him he's a good boy.
This is so sweet. My older dog is getting up there in age and starts to limp after some exercise. Teared up a little thinking of this will be what I see in the future; gotta cherish the moments. ‚ù§
Bless his heart. He deserves extra tummy rubs and treats for that.
What handsome gentlemen. Somebody get that sweet boy a rimadyl.
We truly don‚Äôt deserve dogs and their unconditional love
Old dogs are the best dogs
Good boy
For some reason my eyes are sweating stay happy and healthy boi
Dogs only age physically. They're all the same mentally whether they're 1 or 19. They're all good boyes.
Sooo special the love üê∂‚ô•Ô∏èüêæ
Old dogs are cuter than puppies don't @ me
PLEASE get this dog some good glucosamine.
I both hate and love this....sweet old boy....üò≠‚ù§
Love in its most honest form! üòçüòç
Oh bless him!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
What a good boy indeed
Dogs are so wonderful.
Awww... buddy. That‚Äôs so cute.
A little r/masterreturns material if I'm any judge
I know how he feels!  I am in my 50s and that is how I walk - knees, back, feet, etc... I feel your pain, buddy!
Omg that‚Äôs so sweet. Nothing will stop him from getting to you.
Did someone shave that corgi? That looks suspiciously like a shaved double coat...
Plug walk
Oh man, the feels <3
Oh crap this really made my heart melt. Those dogs really were so happy.
damnit, this makes me miss our gone goldens so much.
This broke me. We just lost my old man this week and I miss him so much. üò¢
Try Galliprant or Gabapentin for that left front arthritis/lick granuloma.
yeah yeah OP the dogs are great but tell us more about that bronco
I just lost my retriever last Tuesday. This video made me happy. They are the best companions ever
Senior dogs are amazing. You can see the love turn him into a puppy again
Welp. I cried. I love senior doggos so much. Wish I could have a senior doggo ranch and adopt them all.
Having a pup with an elder together is so special. The elder shows the pup the ropes and the pup helps the elder feel young again.
Oh man please look into Golden Paste. Super potent natural anti-inflammatory you can make at home with turmeric. Recipe developed by a vet here in Australia. Our 17 year old Jack Russell bounces around like a puppy now, when at 14 he was so stiff and slow to move around. Join Turmeric User Group if your on FB. You'll be amazed at the results.
The tail suddenly starts wagging really high!
Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci as dogs
I have an old Yellow Lab who has some pretty nasty arthritis. I take her in for injections twice a month and they do seem to help a little. It just sucks when they get old. She‚Äôs been my most loyal companion for 11 years.
My old man passed in his sleep a few months ago, right before I moved across the world. I thought I was going to be away when he passed, but I think he knew I was leaving and I‚Äôm glad he passed when I was still around. My old man was my childhood best friend. When I had no one he was still there. In his very last year, it was getting so hard for him to get up to greet me as I‚Äôd walk in the door, but he would always do it. This video makes me miss him so much. Luckily, he still visits me in my dreams and gives me his sloppy kisses.
Is he on anything for his elbow arthritis?  The lick-staining on his forelegs is suggesting there's some discomfort there and he's licking from referred pain.  Gabapentin is usually used to keep that pain in check.
I can't see them suffering, get old and die, it's a nightmare
One day, he will depart from this world and you will miss him so much. 

Speaking from experience.
Just like my old man a few years back. He lost his vision a few months before passing, but he could tell who was who just from his good old nose, always perked up when he smelt me or my brothers, and cuddled up to my mom and dad.
My heart can't handle the little old man walk. üò≠
This is the most wholesome thing I have ever seen!!! Love this so freaking much!!!
This hit me right in the feels.  You can tell that he's old and walking is hard but the second he saw you he pushed himself. That amount of love is just too damn beautiful
Ugh this warms my heart
Recently started giving my pit glucosamine and regular massages. We moved from a place with mostly carpet to one with mostly hardwood so we are slowly covering the floor with rugs so she can have some padding and some grip when she gets up. It‚Äôs hard seeing her lose her mobility but her smiles and tail wags and snuggles haven‚Äôt slowed down one bit. She is the light of my life
The level of loyalty and love a dog can give is not easily found in humans.  Hope you gave him some big pets.
How dare you make that sweet boy walk all that way. I‚Äôd be making a mad dash toward that pupper
Old dogs are the best! Our Geat Dane passed away 3 years ago at almost 11 and I miss him so much. Their frosting is like a sprinkling of what's best in life ‚ù§
My heart. My old boy can't walk very well too due to arthritis but he always makes an effort to walk towards me when he sees me, albeit falling in the process üò• They are just so precious.
Omg I can't.. My dogs are getting older too.
This made me cry. I love old man waddles. I‚Äôll forever miss my boy. Thank you. These are all good cries btw ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I miss having a dog..
I hope my dog loves me half as much as yours loves you!
Give that boy some cbd!
Fuck you. Upvote.
I hope this guy is on some pain medication, he looks very sore. So cute though.
I‚Äôm gonna cry
I love you both.
This is so precious - I literally teared up
Sweet puppy
What a sweet soul! This made my day!
Made me cry
What a good boy ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
FYI- if you haven't tried it- Previcox works wonders.
What a good pup! Loves his hooman
Bless u for having these old boys , u can tell they love u
Bless his sweet heart.
It breaks my heart to see senior dogs with hip issues they just want to jump on you and you can tell by there eyes they are in pain. But that love you get from a dog is so goddam unconditional those back legs could be on fire grinding together and that dog will walk by your side with a smile looking at you like let‚Äôs go it‚Äôs time for me to walk! And will continue pushing you untill it‚Äôs dying breath. Dogs are amazing they don‚Äôt give up on us no matter how they feel something truely the embodiment of selflessness we humans could really benifit learning that trait.
This made me realize I‚Äôve never seen an old corgi until now
The hip dysplasia common in goldens is so sad. Mine wasnt able to walk up stair after 13 yrs but she was my baby
Get him some glucosamine, it will really really help his joints feel asleep better. One every day. You can get some at Walmart. After one a day for month, since it's been building up in his system, it will definitely make him feel much better. Won't help tremendously, but enough that he will have some ease.
Super cute <3 have you tried cbd oil, or turmeric tablets?  The oil has really helped my chronic back pain, and the turmeric pills have really made a hell of a difference to my soon to be 15yr old boy. He's now back to jumping onto the sofa, climbing up the stairs, neither of which he's been able to do for about 4mths previously due to joint pain x
That‚Äôs a clean looking bronco you got there
:( what a good grandpa, thank you for existing
Makes me sad
I cried!  How precious.  Love that sweet old pup.  Seniors are the best.
(‡≤•Ôπè‡≤•) omg please give him a hug for me
That is the sweetest pupper
Hope that big ass house has a pool for him to relieve his joints.
Cbd oil treats for dogs work AMAZING had a 16 yr old puggle with bad arthritis. He's passed now but those treats helped!
Whats up with the good boys front left leg
This brought back all the feels. Lost our old boy 8 weeks ago today. He was so special and every minute with him was a blessing. We don't deserve dogs.
I‚Äôve said it my whole life:
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs. They‚Äôre just too amazing.
 Oh my gosh.   I have some cbd for your old guy.  DM me your address.
Aww man!!!
The body maybe slower but the spirit inside the old, slow body is still a young puppy. So sweetüêæ‚ù§üòéüêæ‚ù§üòé
Gorgeous olde boy. Give him head scritches from me. Is his fren by any chance a corgo?
Old doggos don't know they're old.
"Move hecking leggos I mus give loves faster" - doggo probably
pretty pup
We could learn so much about what love means from dogs
Just lost an old boy that had a similar walk in his last six months.  Cherish your time with him.
Shadowwwww
My beagle used to get up ever time to greet. He was old and arthritic but it never stored him. Cherish every moment you have with him.
I noticed there seems to be a lot of red on his front left leg, did something happen?
Awww my gosh, that is so awesome. Also, r/masterreturns
Old but gold
Clear he loves you!
He smelled ya
Be still, heart.
We put our old girl on some chondroitin for dogs for her joint. It helped somewhat. 

Love my Geriatric K9!!
Whenever I see a vid like this Im always reminded of the story of Ulysses and his faithful companion Argos...the most loyal pooch in  literature - so tragic and sad.
Oh the old grey mare 
She ain't what she used to be 
Ain't what she used to be 
Ain't what she used to be
who's the shorty dog?  A corgi mix?
Please hug him for me
Adorable. I love his moment with my 16 yr old friend as well
Awe‚ù§Ô∏è
Reminds me of my old golden/lab mix. He lived to be 15 and was like this until the very end. I miss him so much even almost 5 years later.
This makes my heart so happy
Makes me miss my first dog she got really old and her back legs gave out. Through her pain she was still so happy to see me whenever I came home.
I love old dogs so much! Am at an age where family asks me when I plan on having children, but I tell them that I just want to be able to afford a lifestyle where I can adopt multiple old dogs.
Hell yeah, thank you for this.
He needs a treat
Beautiful!
Adorable dog, and nice looking Bronco in the background!
Love it
I have a retriever at home and he's getting old. 11 now and moving a lot slower but I can still see the excitement in his face when I get home from work and take him out, just like how this one gets excited. 

They really are man's best friend
The unconditional love of a dog can teach humans so much.
So sweet!
I am willing to donate my blood, plasma, organs, and/or stem cells if it would help add years to this old bois life.
Aww the happy face, little bit of joint pain, really good remedy is sardines in brine just feed him a couple a day really helps .. Id say he tell a tale or two
Aaw poor baby is so happy and trying To get To you as fast as he can!!!!
I love him!
Definitely put some pep in his step. Hope you hooked him up for the effort.
That‚Äôs so cute!
Such a precious old sole!
This reminds me of a family friend‚Äôs pets. They had a golden and corgi. Both were about the same age and unfortunately they‚Äôre gone now. They were the friendliest dogs.
Major ‚Äúending of Homeward Bound‚Äù vibes here. üò≠
Video wouldn't play again after the first play through. I'm fucking spewin'.
Aww!
Looks like he‚Äôs in pain, maybe get one of those dog wheelie bar chairs
Best thing I‚Äôve seen today
When your puppy face gets old you have to take care of them again like the days when they were puppies: accidents in house, help up the steps.... all worth it I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world its part of your doggie package!
Awwwww for sure!  Sweet fella.
Fuck I love the old boyes
Reminds me of one of our old dogs. We took him in after his previous owner couldn't care for him anymore, and another lady who used be part of his life regularly but couldn't take him in either used to come over regularly to take him on walks or rides.

He was nearly blind, and mostly deaf. One day, he was across the yard by the garage sniffing around. She came in and stood quietly by the edge of the house. After a couple of minutes, he must of caught her scent and ran over like a puppy. Little 16-ish year old man
This makes me so sad, seeing him in pain like that.
Hug him for me please
2 old old grandpas.." hey there sonny"
Omg !! Old dogs , children and watermelon wine
Awwwwww üò≠
Warms my heart OP
Wow.  That‚Äôs awesome.
Someone pass him his glasses!
Awww bless their hearts
This tugs at the ol heart strings.
Wow this reminds me of my ex girlfriends house. Almost exactly the same building
OMG no. this is too cute.
So precious!

WHY CANT THEY LIVE FOREVER
Oh lawd my heart
Oldie but Goldie
Man I can't deal with such cuteness
Oh my goodness, I just love the happiness on their faces when they see you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
My baby boy is about the same way. He's 13 or 14 now (rescued as an adult, so can't be sure). His hips aren't great, and mostly he just loves to cuddle. But he never hesitates to struggle his way up to come say hi when I get home.
Too f'n cute!!! No more of this nonsense lol!
What a distinguished gentleman ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wagging his tail like a puppy üòä
They both are so cute and old lol
Sweet dog
I'm not crying, you're crying.
 Oh God, this type is the owner of strong muscles in the legs To hold this size above them but I hope to get one of them I will stay very happy

Aa a dad to an 11.5 year old shepherd rottie mix I will not lie and say I was at an odd mix between smiles and tears with this at the bar.

Aww he zoomed as much as he was able!
That's adorable! That's why I love dogs. They're never too old to show how much they love us!
Well my heart just melted
Do you think it‚Äôs cool to make me cry?
They are both so cute.  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Please give them extra hugs and kisses for me.

My blood valve chamber has exploded.
This reminds me of homeward bound
Give that good old boy a hug for me. He's precious
So wholesome
How sweet!!!!! I hope he‚Äôs on some pain meds and joint supps. Old ass animals are my favorite
I think I am going to cry
Omg stoooooop üò≠üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è
I‚Äôm in love
Everyone here talking about CBD which is great but if that‚Äôs all you‚Äôd give me with a gait like that, I‚Äôd say geeze thanks for that drop in a bucket. If he was my pup, he‚Äôd be on an anti-inflammatory, gabapentin, CBD, omega 3, and adequan- with a side of acupuncture and cold laser. Who knows, maybe he is...
Oh my goodness üò≠
What a sweet boy <3
My heart! What a sweet old friend. Even through pain they love us more.
My little husky mutt is 15+ so I feel the joys (and leaks) of senior dog excitement. 
 Keep up the great work, looks like your doggos love you.
How old is he? I have a 15 - about to turn 16-year-old Cocker Spaniel
Now this I‚Äôll upvote
That‚Äôs a beautiful doggo.  12/10
Omfg this is so sweet!! What a cute boy and sidekick
Ohhhh my heart üò≠üò≠üò≠
This video of a golden retriever and a corgi just reminds me of my dog. We own a corgi and a family friend used to own a golden retriever who is a little older than our dog. When our dog was little he used to play with this golden retriever a lot (a little side note, our corgi was named after him). They were best buddies until our friend‚Äôs dog got stolen. He was not on leash and approached a random man on the street and got taken away. Our friend was devastated. He tried his best to find him but he couldn‚Äôt. The police couldn‚Äôt bother to take this case seriously and as we live in China, there‚Äôs a very high chance that he could have been killed and eaten(But no one knows what actually happened so let‚Äôs just hope he‚Äôs been taken good care by that man). This is a sad story. But to cheer you up, our corgi is turning 12 now and is healthy except he has bone spurs on his legs(but that will only affect him when he runs a lot), and the family friend has started a new family and is doing well.
Adorable üòç‚ô•Ô∏è so much love!
I am officially requesting that the U.S. Government move my portion of tax dollars from extending human life to extending dog life (which may actually result in extending human life too), until further notice. Thank you.
"Peter...!"
I love him!!
Dogs are so precious, so selfless.
That best boy deserves all the loves
My whole heart
I‚Äôve got a 12yo corgi girl. An old dogs love is truly another level. What a sweet video op.
God bless you dear
Reminds me of shadow from homeward bound!

This is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve witnessed today, thank you OP, my thirst has been quenched
still got the pep in the step
Looks like his hips are killing him. He‚Äôs full of love, regardless of his sight and hips
In my defense, I‚Äôm sobbing
I love animals and there‚Äôs no nice way to say this... if any animal is in great pain, I‚Äôve always thought that the humane thing would be a visit to the vet to put the animal to sleep. Someone I know had an old sick dog, and she tried to prolong the dogs life by carting the dog to different vets to get other opinions, and one vet was four states away. All the while the dog was in the back of the van laying on a pillow while in great pain and feeling every bump. Sometimes you have to make that tough decision to put the animal to sleep to save him from living in pain knowing that he‚Äôll be better off.
What a good old boy he is, cherish him.
Sweet doggos.
Also bad ass bronco in the back ground
Sick bronco

So cute! My dog is also getting old and will be turning 15 soon. Old dogs are the cutest!
I love it. Reminded me of my dog.
Their love is truly unconditional. So should ours.
So much joy!!!!  He loves you so much!
Awwwwwwww my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
Our 19yr old pup wobbled like this due to arthritis and what helped was crushed up glucosamine  in his food. I used to get the expensive petco kind, but the vet told me generic works the same and I used to get them off the dollar store.

We could tell between the days he got it, and the days he didn't. It makes a big difference.

I know so many people are pushing cbd but that can get pricey very quickly
Hiho silver Away
Omg the most good of all the boys üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è
I thought that 30 year old Bronco was gonna hobble down the drive as well.

How old are they?
I love them both
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH
Awww you could see the joy in their eyes like an old couple seeing there grandchildren
Ohhhhh sweet old man!!
100k karma and some posted tbia yesterday talking about how the dog's spots have faded over 10 years
Just break my fucking heart
Happines noise
I'm going to cry...
So beautiful. üò≠üòç
Goldies smiling is my favourite thing
My heart.
Its enough to make a grown man cry... and that's okay
CUTIE!
He may be old but you can tell he still loves you just the same as the first time he saw youüíúüíú

Good boy training next good boy!
Oh my goodness! My heart! Ohhhh that‚Äôs that love that‚Äôs grown over a lifetime! I love this so much.
This is absolutely heart breaking. I'm not ready.
Old boy but still a very good boy!

I wanted to see you pet him :(
How awesome!!!!
You just know he has had and will continue to have, a lifetime of love.
He reminds me of Shadow from Homeward Bound
You just peeled my feels right there I tell ya whut

Try givinng him dryed rose hip for the joints. Sometimes it works wonders on old animals, including men.
Give your good boy some lovin' for me, what a sweetie you have there!
D‚Äôaww, a loving old boy‚Äôs Arthrity Taps üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
The best boy
This is absolutely lovely
Poor shadow is looking ruff these days!
I‚Äôm trying not to cry

And failing.
Nice
Thanks for sharing this handsome pair...
Awwww, it's like when I go to my parents house. I open the door. Walk inside, once I say something no matter where in the House I hear the tiniest thud, then kitty feet charging in my directions with the distinct "meowmeowmeowmeow" sound you get when a cat is meowing running at the same time. It's heartwarming, I'll never get tired of it.
Nice bronco ü§ü nice dogs too
Awwwwww. This was so sweet. Also is he on some sort of joint supplement? Some of them work miracles. I love how his trot sped up when he saw you.
What breed is the one on the right??
Awww
What's wrong with his leg?
oh man, this one warms my heart. That's pure love, right there!
My heart just melted what the FRICK that‚Äôs so cute
u/SpaceTMerlin the old dog is so cute
My heart üò©
Awww you can definitely see when he sees u!!! That's love!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I started tearing up. This made my cold heart feel things. This is great doggo.
Goodest boys
Always a pupper! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Can you kiss your doggie and tell him I said hi.
Bog boi n' little boi
THE GOODEST BOY
This made me think of my old pupper I used to have
That waddle is darling. I can't get over it.
Both beautiful. That little jog ü•∞
If that was my dog i would put it down, poor fella can barely walk.
Why did you make him walk toward you?  He is in obvious pain and yet you stand  and film him staggering your way for internet points.
good bois, they deserve the world.

I'm not crying, you're crying!
Why are my eyes watery
good boys omg
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Dogs are the purest expression of love.
This made me tear up. There is nothing sweeter than a happy old dog.
Awww. That is lovely. I have tears
Aww, love him. Damn arthritis! My poor girl has it bad too. Try Duralactin. Doesn't stop it completely, but it helps some.
I‚Äôm sending as much love as I possibly can from here. What a perfect beautiful loving being. You have true love in your life, right there. <3
All he needs is a bathrobe.
Come hell or high water that good doggo is coming to say hello to his master. Great video.
Makes me really miss my golden. She wasnt able to live till old age.
Oh god this broke my heart. I‚Äôm going to lose my mind when my golden gets like this
I just cried. We don't deserve dogs.
Once a good boy always a good boy.
Off your phone! Go love him. What an amazing dog.
I‚Äôm not crying no these aren‚Äôt tears my eyes are sweating
Ouch ... my heart hurts
We don‚Äôt deserve them
Oof. Right in the feels.
Galliprant (60 mg) helps my dog‚Äôs arthritis.

Might want to try and get a prescription.

Both dogs look loyal. :)
Dogs are the fuckin best
This is LOVE.  He‚Äôs the type that will crawl over broken glass in the middle of July to you because of LOVE.
I love my oldies
I wasn‚Äôt planning on crying today but here we are
Love this, wish we got to see the joy that ensued when they reached their person! :)
Cherish every fucking minute you can with your best pal
I love him so sweet
Glucosamine is such a help to old retrievers. Gorgeous dogs
Old dogs make me cry. 
Old people with old dogs, oi.
Oh my goodness!! What a sweet boy!
Old but gold
Dogs are the best
The little ear perk before he started running at you as fast as his old lega would take him
This gif ended too soon :(
So cute üòÇ
Bless his soul. Sending lots of pets
Bless him what a  cute old man dog. The love of a pet is like no other!
Aww man get that poor old man some Rimadyl or cosequin!
I'd give half my lifespan to my pets if I could. I don't want to live without them
What a good old boy! I can see his soul in his walk.
I needed this today. So sweet.
Old dogs are so pure.  I love your dog...  treats all around!!!
Oh my goodness those poor babies. Pls give extra love.
Idk why but the two old dogs side by side looking saggy but like good friends is giving me big ‚Äòthe Irishman‚Äô vibes
*Oh, Peter, I love you so!*
You better rub bellies till last breath is drawn!
This is the goodest old boi

God this hits the feels so hard. Old boy is still a happy and loving pup inside. Poor baby boy hobbling, why do our fur babies have to get old so much quicker than us... :(
GOOD BOI

What a beautiful old pupper. I don‚Äôt know him, but I love him so much
Dogs are angels.

I love them! Your goodest old boy is a treasure. Just want to hug them both. What a nice way to come home. Please give them a few treats for me
Best Puppy video ever!
Doggo needs a massage
I'm commenting to make sure the comments aren't at 666 anymore
I‚Äôm sorry but he‚Äôs too old to be kept alive. He‚Äôs probably suffering
[removed]
Breaks my heart.
This pisses me off. I know I'll get downvoted to shit but whatever.

Your dog is in a fuckload of pain. That level of arthritis is cripplingly painful. And you're keeping your dog alive and in constant pain because it makes you feel good. Do the right thing and be merciful and put the poor thing to sleep.
No you're crying

Old but still happy. Truly one of the goodest of boys.
Aww good boy!
Senior dogs are the best. The love they give is incredible.‚ù§Ô∏è

Beautiful Bronco (looks 92-96)! I have a '96 I'm redoing myself, and your two-tone paint is inspiring me. :)

Mines 13. The only thing she can still hear is the cheese drawer in the fridge. I always feel bad when I sneak up on her
Walk to him already you fuckin terrorist!
I like the Bronco, my friend.
:')
This reminds me of my old girl who I had to put down a few months ago. Cherish your time with him, I‚Äôm sure you are!! Such a hard time to see them like this, physically, but they both still had the spirit mentally!! Wish the best for you and your boy :)

I'm 8 months pregnant and I am sobbing.
took the legs of the right one for the left one
EDITED: Downvote my nice comment about your dog? Fine then.. I'll say something mean instead of calling him cute.

I hope your dog dies soon. Fuck Reddit and its backwards ass users.
oh he coming for you, as waggily as he can. blessed be you by this old precious doggo
Oh poor baby doggy.
More like smelled you.
poor doggo...
Look at this wholesome news report https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfr64zoBTAQ
We don't deserve them.
Is that a Bronco? Looks sick as hell
No, we can't.  We don't see in potato.
I think it‚Äôs time he walks with Jesus
Jesus fuck, put it out of its misery.
put that thing down so help dog kind and them struggles

Jesus Christ, how old are they?
Dat bitch about to die
Yes, lets force this clearly severely arthritic dog run down a long driveway to see me instead of going to him to help him avoid some of the pain he's clearly in.

All I see is an asshole mistreating this dog.
