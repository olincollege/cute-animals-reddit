Hagrid looks different here
This man radiates something I can’t explain but I must hug him
Hagrid! Kind, gentle, loyal and true friend to all living creatures!
The way his eyes move watching the birds made me laugh so hard. Great video
My friend passed out in my backyard a few summers ago and I walked out to find a couple finches plucking at his beard and hair to use as nesting material. He didn't have a clue.
That person is so fucking pretty and gorgeous
Everyone is talking about the guy but these hummingbirds are so cool! How crazy is it that they can hover and fly backwards? Is there any other animal that can do either of those things? Also, I wonder if at any point there was giant hummingbirds.
Or you become Hagrid who finally learned the benefits of conditioner...
You're a princess, Hagrid
I want to hear you sing
This is one gorgeous male specimen.
Humming birds and fabulous hair?! Can we be friends?
The Beast has become the Beauty.
He's the lovechild of Radagast the brown and Hagrid
You truly do look like a Disney character tbh
2 months of quarantine without a hair cut
That fuckin grin is infectious my dude
PS1 Hagrid is a Disney Princess
Hurley??!
this mans glorious mane though
With that level of charisma, you can pull off anything...
Real life Hagrid

Should not ave posted that. Should not ave posted that.
Oh my **god**

Are you a Dwarf Druid??
Radagast the Brown!
You're a jolly big oaf just like me. Bear hug?
He just looks so content. Contentedness is the best thing ever imo.
That is a beautiful man!
That dude looks so happy
Bro, you DO have fabulous hair
*L'Oreal*, because everyone is worth it.
Robert baratheon?
This video would be amazing in slow motion
Get in my ~~bed~~ garden bed
He has the hands of a sugeon
I’ve seen my first forest spirit
This video made me want to go put on some *eye protection.*  All I could think about was one of those hummingbirds poking Snow White in the eye.
That’s amazing! My girlfriend got me the exact same ring a few months ago, I haven’t tried it yet but now I’m definitely going to.
Hagrid is that you? The griffin attacked again, and we need you to stop it before it gets put down
Your hair is Gorgeous!   ....just putting it out there.  Love your little friends too!  ❤️
Very very cool
This is every big bloke I've ever met, who you assume is as mean as he looks, when he softens up and lets his guard down, lol 😁
Bro literally wtf??? Who the hell are you? My long lost brother??
Whirring around, 

I flap my wings,

A hum about,

Makes you look out!

But ‘tis only I,

The humming bird,

So fast and so quick,

Looking for nectar to drink,

I fly around

Yet in the glint of my eye

And the scent of my nose,

I find some sweet sugar,

From a kind old man,

I drink and drink,

Till I feel all sweet,

I say “I’m flattered but I really got to go,

I’m a bird you see,

Flap flap flap,

And away I’ll be”
OMG marry me! You can be the princess every day!
I am jealous. Of both your locks, and your birdie feeding skills
Such luscious hair! 


Maybe he's born with it!
Instead of Disney princess, I see you more like a gentle wizard. A sweet, young Gandalf :3 thanks for sharing this vid
I got to hold two hummingbirds.  At the place where I work, we keep the back door open during the summer to get a breeze going.  Two times in one week a hummingbird flew in, and then kept trying to get out of a small closed window.

Luckily I was able to get a ladder, gently catch the bird and then take them outside to release them.  It probably doesn't sound all that exciting to just hear the story, but I was pretty jazzed to be able to hold a hummingbird.
A mix of Rubeus Hagrid and Samwell Tarly
You’re a lizard, Gary.

Hagrid are you alright?
just water with sugar.
You majestic man, damn
So they sell ring pops for hummingbirds now?
This only works as wizard lvl 5+
Please tell me how long you were sitting there waiting for them to come?
That is the most beautiful man-mane I have ever seen!
The best Care of Magical Creatures Teacher!
10/10 I’d be friends if I was a bird
What shampoo and conditioner does he use??
The way his face lights up when the birds start to feed is a wonderful thing to see.
You ain't foolin nobody, hagrid
Words cannot adequately describe how jealous I am of this young Hagrid.
Tbh that is some cool hair
I'd love to see a video of how it works.
You're a Princess, Hagrid.
Looks like Snow White is sleeping off a hang over so she had one of her dwarves fill in for the day
Hagrid and his magical beasts.
Budget cut hagrid. How's it going with Disney?
Harry potter got a remake?
/r/beardsgonecuddly
He's not happy with it lmao
If hummingbirds feeding doesn't make you smile, seek medical attention immediately.
Hello Hagrid
The closure of hairdressers during the coronacrisis is surely showing its results!
Where can I buy my own Disney princess ring?
That is obviously a Forest nymph.
This is the friendliest looking man i have ever seen. I would entrust my kids to him, no questions asked
Hagrid?
Where can I get this hummingbird feeder????
This is unusual, hummingbirds are usually vicious little fighter jets on steroids. The fact they aren’t spearing each other while you try to avoid getting stabbed in the eye is a miracle 😂
The only thing that could make this better is if those Holiday Lights were turned ON..
Hagrid straightened his hair
Hagrid always did have a way with magical creatures
You also become the keeper of keys at Hogwarts, school of witchcraft and wizardry.
Words cannot adequately describe how jealous I am of this young Hagrid.
Those are clearly Canadian hummingbirds, all I saw were speech bubbles:

Go ahead!

No I insist!

Your turn!

Oops,sorry!

No my mistake!

Please have a sip!
ey hagrid
That’s a beautiful man
He’s. So. Cute. 🥰
Gosh, he is so freeking beautiful when he smiles! :D <3
I'm in love with this man! Does he have any social media where I can follow him? This video is so cute.
Nice try it without sugar water and then you can be a princess okay?
Hagrid discovers L’Oréal Paris

This looks like Sam from GoT doing a fantastic Hagrid

I'm terrified of humming birds flying so close to me. It's the needle beaks i think.
Yer a wizard, hairy!
I want to become a Disney princess
Ahahaha this is amazing. I'm envious of your fabulous hair.
...and in the darkness bind them.
I gotta say, 10/10 hair my dude.
This is looks like a shampoo commercial
That is some fabulous hair
You're now a groundskeeper and in charge of caring for many magical creatures. Congratulations.
This is wonderful
That's some majestic hair.
You’re a wizard, Harry!

**You’re a princess Hagrid!**
Holding a bird feeder helps
I love this. I love him. I love lamp.
The beautiful beard tho.
Have you tried feeding them from your mouth?
"Hagrid, have you combed your hair?"
Yeap it’s definitely those luscious locks alright. Not the humming bird nectar you’re holding.
I was waiting for him to let one out of his mouth
The subtle wind in the hair is what really completes this.
Thanks for the smile.
Your a giant, hagrid.
YER A WIZARD HARRY
Hagrid and the seeker balls
If Hagrid and Jesus mixed with a disney princess' luscious hair were all fused together, you would be the product.
If Sam Tarly and Hagrid had a kid.
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have that hairdo before this whole virus is over.
This feels like seeing a Summer Alternative Skin for Santa
Druid
This is wonderfully wholesome. Thank you for sharing, sir!
That's how bird feeders work tho.  

The other vid where the bird just came and sat on the girl's chest was more impressive
it's the beard
Ah! That's why Harig likes animals. Young Hagrid, way to go.
You look like an innocent tree to those birds.
Or a demigod.
I thought he was tryna be Hagrid wtf
What has a hand and holds up a jar, feeding 2 hummingbirds, this guy.
Disney gave me unrealistic expectations about hair... and how much forest friends would love me.
Everyone is saying hagrid. I'm saying Radagast.

I don’t understand how people can pass 1 million karma.... I’m struggling to get 10k lol
Yer a wizard Harry! But I'm a princess!

-Hagrid
Ok foreal how long do I have to sit and wait? They humming birds are in my backyard nearly every day eating the nectar we leave. Can I just grab the nectar thing I have and wait for em? Or do people that do this kinda have them trained by doing this every day or something?
You should do a slowmo
Why do I get the feeling you often say things you shouldn’t have said
Disney princess? That’s 100% Hagrid!
Hagrid the Disney Princess
Ah, hi, ho, ha-hah, a merry-tum-tum-toodle!
A wild Tom Bombadil has appeared.
This dude’s hairline looks so even like as if someone used the Microsoft eraser a bit too much on one side
Righteous locks!
Youre super fuckin dope! I can barely get them to not scare away sitting still 6 feet away.
The wee smile at 0:5 is so pure
I mean it's Hagrid of course animals love him!
Hagrid im not a wizard!
Hagrid called; he wants his hair back
He looks like he would be the best friend ever
I am unbelievably jealous. Hummingbirds are my favorite bird. Is it possible to learn this power?
Ok hagrid
I think I could just be really stoned but after he brings the thing closer to his face the birds look like really good CGI
I'm a princess harry
Haggis!? Is that you?? When did you figure out muggle tech?
You look like Hagrid if he became a sponsor for Pantene.
Okay, Hagrid
Either your hands are super steady or mine are super shaky
Hagrid?
IRL HAGRID
im jealous
Yer a princess, Hagrid
You just made real life amazing.
I want to start a power metal band with this guy. If it turns out he can’t sing, I’ll just stick him behind the keyboard.
> When you hold food for a certain animal, that certain animal comes to get the food that you are holding

FTFY
Gimli if Disney bought the rights to LOTR
I was expecting a furious battle yell.

Not gonna lie, I'm slightly dissapointed.
Hagrid got a makeover
This is the face one makes at their birthday wondering what's there in the huge polka dotted wrapped box
So happy they shared and didn’t fight over it.
Nice. But I always thought hummingbirds were territorial, so how are two birds sharing that feeder and not fighting over it?
Looks more like Hagrid than a Disney Princess
For real, hummingbirds are super chill animals. We have a ton of them that show up every year and you can literally walk up within a few feet of their feeder while talking and they don’t care. They’ll even fly up if they aren’t already there.
He's like Hagrid, crossed with Russel Crowe, and then Fabio from the eyes up.
It's about time! Disney has needed a bearded princess for a while, now!
Such steady hands. I can't hold them like that, I would scare the birds off really quickly.
Aw the humming birds are taking turns
He looks like a Sasquatch that got an Emerald City makeover.
Good chill!
Probably the most badass princess ever
hagorrd
Mans got that 10 year quarantine length hair
Hummingbirds never come close to a Muggle, they fleeeee! You are a wizard!
You could seriously be in prequel called, “Hagrid and the magical hummingbirds” or something Harry Potter-ish...
You’re a wizard hairy!
No, they just like red.
how can you be so majestic yet such a  babe
Justin Lee Collins?
Slurp slurp pass
I'm a princess, Harry!
He looks like hagrid
Nice
Beorn or Hagrid? I cant decide
You have kind eyes.
Very fabulous indeed!
I would pay good money to see this Disney movie. Also how still are those hands
This is adorable. Thanks for making my morning!
.... I'm gonna have to try this.
Ahh, Hagrid and his animals
YOU'RE A DISNEY PRINCESS MISS.GRANGER!
One ring to rule them all
To hummingbirds we are really slow giants. Imagine how slowly something that huge to us would have to be to comfortably get close to it for food.
This is just Hagrid when he showers, conditions, and combs his hair.
It's glamour Hagrid. He is majestic.
HAGRID. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO YE AFTER THE LAST BOOK
Humming birds main defense is stabbing the eyes out of other hummingbirds.  You were lucky here, OP.
Hagrid
I seem to remember a cartoon bit about a bird living in a beard. It was an endangered species, so the poor bearded fellow couldn’t shave until the bird moved on. Where on Earth did I see that...?
You'll probably miss this, but I love when the one bird realizes you're cool and starts to look outward for threats. Like, "This dude chill, where the crows at?"
Where might I find a hummingbird cup like yours?
u/toubm
There’s an hotel in copper canyon Mexico that’s has incredible views and an enormous amount of hummingbirds flying around the terraces awesome place.
You’re holding sugar water and there’s some bright red in the immediate area. Your hair is not important. To anyone.
That is absolutely amazing & incredible! 💙Thank you for your lovely post.  😄
This looks like the gentlest giant there is
Princess Gimley
From Rubeus to Fabulous
Im amazed by how these birds can fly backwards
Harry you want some cup o' tea
This was pretty much Dumbledore’s interview process for Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.
You look like Hagrid had a baby with Keanu Reeves
The food source is moving
The food source is moving
Cool?
Cool.
Keep sipping
You’re a wizard Harry!
How do you get hummingbirds to share like this? Mine all dominate the feeders til they’re ousted; territorial.
Hummingbirds only want one thing and he's holding it.
really they just live in your hair because it makes a wonderful nest
Dat Guy from harry potter
Superb hair 10/10
Harry,
Your face instantly relaxes at the first landing of the birds. Wonderful feeling, yes?

It’s great that nature is so trusting so we must try to reciprocate that trust. 

But I must add that if some predator comes at me because it sees me as its dinner, I trust my legs will carry me as far away and quickly as possible.  

All the best Harry. Your hair is beautiful and matches you perfectly.
Hurley from Lost?
Where was this? I am envious of people who live in parts of the world where there are hummingbirds. I love watching the sparrows in my back garden but hummingbirds are on a whole different level.
Or, ya know.. Hold a bird feeder
Wholesome viking
so peaceful and romantic, when i say romantic i mean the hairs
Long hair. Burly beard. Good with animals. Yup, this man is Hagrid.
Also help when you stick the birds food right under your face. Haha what a magical coincidence
Sexy Hagrid.
This is nice
All fun and games until you wake up with a nest in your beard and dwarves start harassing you
You have the spirit of a tree.
Hello hagrid!
Amazing video
You are wizard harry
What a pleasant looking person.  Goddamn!
Oh, Hagrid!
This work requires a lot of meditation. Great job.
The small smile in the beginning has made my entire month.

I refuse to believe that hummingbirds are real. They look so cgi-ish, I am actually mind blown and refuse to believe that they’re real. But you’re now my favourite Disney princess
I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still, that I become invisible to the eye. 
Wow, my beard is fine but I would pay anything for these kind of hair
Looking like a proud warrior of Gondor.
Oh my god, that's totally Hagrid
I have long brown hair as well (female), but I am still jealous of that these lucious locks.
I want to live in his beard.
Drop that hair care routine ;)
I'm sure it's the hair and nothing to do with the sugar water.
Youre a princess harry
It's Papa Aris and they think he's bushes
I was waiting for a bird to sit on his hand till the end
" I’ve mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still… That I become invisible to the eye."
Hey look, it’s Hagrid!
He looks like swagger... Twitch streamer. Like face wise not considering the beard and hairs.

I feel happy when you smiled a little. You're a beautiful man 🥰

You look like the chubby version of John Wick :)

Not saying that you're fat, you look awesome
Please share your hair secrets
He’s like a more glorious, summer version of santa.
Yur a princess Harry!
I mean, that’s fantastic hair.
or hagrid.
This is true. Sorry, I don’t make the rules. I just observe them and the evidence you’ve given me is overwhelming.
They don't want him for his sweet hair they want him for his sweet nectar
Princess hagrid
What a beautiful man
Now I need a dwarven Disney Princess with a lustrous beard. Disney need to make this.
I’m jealous for so many reasons. 🤩
What a lovely smile, I just wanna hug him!
How did the air feel with their little wings so close?!
I don't think it's the hair that's attracting the birds...
I want to braid your hair and frolic with you through the woods.

This is the classy version of dreads. You have a nest that's clean.  They have.... Debris

Cool to know - When flying a humming birds heart rate can reach 1250 beats per minute.
That's more than 60 beats per second!

Thanks, scary, angry, judgmental corvid! Saved me $30 on CVS Tweezermans.
You really do look like our boi Hagrid, you'd be a shoe in if you they did a remake or needed to cast younger Hagrid for something. Are you also a giant by chance?
It looks like he never gets stressed

Yeah I never believed he let the monster out of the chamber of secrets from the beginning, look at him, he's just too good hearted.

Sure hummingbirds are cute and all... until you end up too close to a feeder or they think your eyeballs are flowers. Then they are absolutely terrifying.
He looks like Hagrid

Will admit I thought Hagrid too! Even though I’m not a Harry Potter fan
But he cheated by using a bird feeder.
He even talks to animals!!!
I would gladly swap 2 dozen Rainbow Lorikeets  for a dozen of your Humming birds.
I’m just surprised the birds aren’t fighting each other. We have 3 hummingbird feeders and those lil bastards are hella territorial and chase off the other hummingbirds constantly
You are the disney princess this world needs right now! :D

Hagrid, back to Hogwarts for you!
R.I.P for all of the interested guys seeing you from behind.
I have a crush now!

The more amazing part is the hummingbirds sharing the flower.  Usually they fight  like hell.

Hummingbirds would often grab hairs off of my late Golden retriever as he laid it in the sun to use for thief nests when he was an old boy and loved just laying around soaking in the rays
Hagrid or Jesus I cant tell
His hand is so steady. My coffee addicted body prob wouldnt last for 5sec lol
Welcome to Care of Magical Creatures, I am professor Rubeus Hagrid.
Hey there now, Squirrely Dan.
not a princess, a hagrid.
This guy for president.
Hugs. You don’t feed hummingbirds by hand without being a seriously peaceful dude.
These comments are soaked. What an absolute alpha, he's killing it lol. The hummingbirds are cool too.
Who knew that you could replace fans with hummingbirds for that perfect wind blown hair effect?
he should weave that flower into his beard
You can't call yourself a Disney princess if you sit still for 30 minutes holding sugar water, of course they're gonna come
He’s beautiful in the most unconventional ways for a man. He just radiates both a powerful masculinity and a serene femininity all at once.
I was more thinking of Hagrid but ok.
Fabulous hair indeed
That was mesmerising.

The sweet life of a groundskeeper
Teach me your hair secrets 😊
The fact that they know how to take turns, unlike people who don't let you in whne you're merging onto the highway
Harris, I knew you were the disney princess of Hogwarts. Nobody wanted to acknowledge it🤷
Wait is this the E-Y-E-S guy?
Peace and bliss in one picture. Wonderful! Made my day. :)
This dude is more fabulous than i‘ll ever be
He became a princess over night
"Oooooh look at meeee. Quarantine drinking hasn't given me the shakes yet."  Beautiful hair though.
Wholesome ❤️
who said magic is not real
That’s really cool. I’m going to make special glasses where there is a flower cup as each lens.  That way the birds will fly right up to you to drink.  What could go wrong?
you have a mastery of the remarkable static \^ \^
That's a druid right there kek
That is a magnificent head of hair. I'm jealous.
It's good being the one thousandth comment
Quarantine day 500
I love the little smile a couple seconds in that says, “Yes, *yes*, I *AM* a Disney princess!”
He is so gorgeous! I’m so jealous of that fabulous hair!
Is that you Hagrid?
Sir, you’re glorious
Has more of a Grizzly Adams flair to me.
Seriously, that hair is glorious.
I’d watch this YouTube channel.
Definitely Hagrid!
Just because you are disguised as a bear....

.... A hairy one...
I know it's the wind, but it looks like their wings are making his hair wave majestically
Well his hair is indeed fabulous.
I can’t tell if you are wearing a shirt or if you are just, hair. As in, hair is you you are hair
;; incredible. Wow.
He has become one with nature.
I want to be friends with him...
Seriously fabulous hair !
Hagrid got some hair products
everyone needs a haircut
It sucks the video cut off right before he slowly starts raising it towards his face and his mouth opens wide.
I’ve got a bunch of hummingbirds near my house, but I don’t think they’d ever do this with me so now I’m sad.
The aquarium in my city has a bird exhibit where you can buy those flower cups. They’re filled with nectar or something similar, birds will swarm you for it
He looks like Hagrid
That is some glorious goddamn hair.
 I want to braid flowers into this man’s hair while he tells me stories of rescuing mythical creatures.
Ent that something!
I'm getting demi-god vibes, like Maui from Moana.
You're a harry, Wizzard.
Hey ho!
You look like my brother if he were pretty
**Restrained Joy**
The princess Viking and the two birds
Ab fab
Hagrid when camera isn’t pointing at him
This is the best thing I've seen so far today. Thanks for the ”awwww” moment OP.
Flap flap flap x10000000
This is the only reason I woke up today.
Radagast!
Hummingbirds are so amazing!
How far through this thread do I need to go before I find someone who immediately thought of Ryan Davis and got sad?
Majestic af.
These birds are so polite.
Reminds me of Tom Bombadil
This is the kind of guy I wish I had met when I was young.  I love that little smile.
More like hagrid than a Disney princess, but Disney princess works I guess
What an adorable human
why he look like hes holding his breath??
What kind of quest are you sending us on?
Ohh man, I did not know I had a non-evil twin.  That is great news!
He should not have that,  
HE SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT!
U r a Disney prince Hagrid.
Holy crap, this guy is literally my double. It's spooky. If you've never had long hair, it feels wonderful in a breeze. Not great in the summer though.
You’re a Harry wizard!
Like Fabio and Hagrid combined
Young Hagrid discovered conditioner
You're a princess Hagrid!
Bro, that's Hagrid from Harry Potter.
*GODS* I was strong then!
I think they just think you’re a tree
Fuck you, Hagrid
Hagrid does teach Care of Magical Creatures...
Or hagrid
So, how are you Hagrid?
I love your hair... you’re very charming too :)
At first glance, I thought it was Jorge Garcia. Everybody loves Hurley!
Hagrid?
not a Disney princess but Hagrid with baby Dragons
This post makes me so happy!
The moment where you see the joy hit his face warms my heart.
I want to marry you.
Damn, lookin whimsical AF
You’re a wizard Harry
The anime wind blowing effect on the hair may have something to do with it.
Damn he's majestic
Can we please appreciate the Amazing flight control these birds have. As an engineer, I cannot just stop admiring it. Our machines are no where near this good.
Yer a Disney Princess, Hagrid.
Something about this man radiates peace and kindness. His smile made my day.
I disagree he's a Disney princess. He's baiting the birds in. A princess would chill and animals come to them naturally right?
Hagrid, but sexy.
His hair, its just.... beautiful. And those hummers too.
Hagrid got sexy
Waxin flaxin for sure.
Is the wind from their wings making his hair flap like that?
That’s quite a breeze created by those little birds, enough to blow Hagrid’s hair back.
his little smile when the birds started coming up to him made my heart melt
Oh Tom Bombadil I'm so sorry they cut you from the movies.
Yer a Wizard Canary.
Gah this made me smile 😊
Human lion!

He's so majestic
I'm upvoting the look of pure joy in his eyes
You look like the most wholesome man ever lkfjgdkjfah
I have never been so convinced that Harry Potter is a real thing
It’s hagrid
Came for Hagrid comments, wasn’t disappointed
Young Hagrid looks good
The most beautiful princess I have every seen...

Hagrid Hagrid! Let down your hair!
Only his stylist knows for sure
😊😊 that's great
It’s my dad!!!!
Genuinely hope this guy walks around with a small pink umbrella.
We found Jeff johanson
Marry me
Hagrid's younger years
When did Hagrid become a Disney princess?
.. Hagrid?
Maybe he used the Garnier with fruit extracts
He's like Radagast!
Real life Hagrid!
