Dog on the right: I'm just happy to be here
The other dog has the demeanor of one of those crazy ass hyenas from Lion King
What a beautiful horse.
Just in case anyone is interested, his name is Brewski and he is just under 2 years old :)

Edit: since people have been asking, here’s a picture of him the day after we brought him home next to our 8lb morkie! https://imgur.com/gallery/c3ExTco
Look. It's Clifford the Big Red Dog's cousin.
How big are the dumps?
https://imgur.com/a/T9MM9ab
He’s almost big enough to start solving mysteries
Some say the dog has absorbed the house and those two are dead.
“I’m involved too!” - other doggo
What type of dog is that?!?
I can't wait to own a house big enough for a great Dane!!
[deleted]
That’s The Beast from The Sandlot.
r/absoluteunits
Those farts... im so sorry.
You could probably get away with shitting on the floor in your living room and blaming it on your horse...erm dog.
I love him very much.
The best part is that he's perfectly comfortable with being picked up because he has NO idea he's giant.
extra lorge
Jesus Christ, you could ride that thing into battle
That one puppers like "look at that gigantic fucker! Just kidding, I know, you're really only looking at me? Aren't I so good?"
How much does this hefty pooch weigh?
Bottom right goober is like “I’m next! I’m next! Me! Me! Pick me up next!” Haha
Wow you house trained a pony. Good job!
What does he weigh ?
Looks like you [accidentally bought a horse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B94q7gUu75k)
Not sure if you’ve ever heard of golden paste but it’s helpful for large breed dogs prone to bone and joint issues :)

My older beagle gets it for her bad back. It’s amazing. But also good for preventing things.
What you need sent is a saddle.
That has got to be the best photobomb ever by dog #2!
The pure happiness on the other dogs face is amazing
I love the pose, it reminds me of Marmaduke comics from my childhood.
I saw a documentary about this dog.

https://youtu.be/xGx6IhjoWqw
It’s your fault for loving him too much... like Clifford the Big Red Dog.
A great problem to have
You may have a Descendant of Fenrir
r/sneakybackgroundfeet
He’s going to start turning red soon and change his name to Clifford.
Clifford the big red dog
And there love made Clifford grow so big ☺️
How much does it cost to feed him?
That's a small horse
That big boi is the greatest dane
Dog continued on next person
Other dog: “He’s the biggest best friend I ever had.”
I can't begin to imagine the garbage bag poops this doggo takes
It’s a Buick!
r/doglifting
That's a big ass Chihuahua.
It’s a two parter. How much food does he eat and how big are his shits? Like can you get it in a one handed doggie poo bag? Or is he a multiple bagger?
daaaam, well no one is going to try to rob you
Fix: paint him red, make it a tourist event where you charge money to pet him.
It would be worth it to train him to use the toilet.
Such a sweet face
I goddamn love second doggo popping in saying "Look at this motherfucker!"
I'm more interested in the size of his shit. It must be large enough to bury a baby in it.
Just so you know, there was one other recorded instance of this, I believe you could use them as a frame of reference! It’s been about 60ish years but... “Clifford the big red dog” by Norman Bridwell should have most of the answers to your questions. 


You’re welcome in advance.
Zoinks, Scoob
Your other pup appears to be half hyena.
Dogomus gigatamus. such a sweet breed
I can’t stop laughing at all the comments.  Thank you community for the joint effort.
Thought you were buying a dog, huh? You were bamboozled!
I feel like I know this guy. OP, is the males name Dean?
Mmmm that’s a big ol scooby. I’ve never had one that big but god damn. I wouldn’t be able to resist calling that big sum bitch in to the bed in a cold winters night.
Clifford IRL
Dog in the bottom right is like “this fuckin shit it bananas lmao”
Clifford?
his shits must be big as a motherfucker
How do we know you’re not tiny people?
The dog in the bottom corner is like "Look how big my bro is!!!"
still a lap dog to me!
Marmaduke is that you?!
That's a huge, friendly food bill right there.
When he starts turning red then you really gotta worry.
You don’t need help. Just let it keep growing until it’s big enough to ride.
Please tell me his name is Clifford.
Paint him red for Halloween please
It's probably like feeding two teenage boys worth of food cost.
I love this!

I have a great dane - Catahoula leopard mix who is 5 months old. Everyone already asks if he's grown, but he acts like a puppy so they're confused.
How big are its poops?
Love the derp on the floor there
Beautiful dog!!
That’s the kind of dog you can put armor on and ride into battle 😁
I would **not** want to have to pay for his food lol
Not for nothing are they called *Great* Danes.
I know what you mean, we have a 6 month old great dane/ bull mastif cross. She is also continuing to enlarge.
The goodest lap dog
He’s not named Otto by any chance, is he?

When you feed a dog, never feed him a lot.  So much and no more. Never more than a spot.  Or something may happen! You ever know what. 

(Slight adaptation from [*A Fish out of Water*](https://youtu.be/X_z7W6GkXtU), Helen Palmer/PD Eastman.)
Please tell me his name is Clifford
Marmaduke
The best part is he shows no signs of struggle
I like how the derp in the forefront is delighted with his large brother
There should be a sub like r/Imsorryjon but for marmaduke.
Brother just took a shit in the “fancy” living room
The dog on the right is just like "Have you guys seen Paul? Look at him! He's HUGE"
Aww the smiling puppo. "I have no idea what's going on, I'm just happy to be here!"
He will be the best dog you will ever have own. Give him lots of love and he will never fail you.
I have the same problem with my sons. One is 16 and 6foot 9. The other is 14 and 6'2".
Looks like the typical lap dog.
Hell yes keep feeding that monster
The other dogs all Smiling like hahah glad I'm not that Guy lols
Big dog ==> big poop
What kind of horse is that? 

(our boo was named Everest. He was... massive. 😭)
Look at that giant puppers!!! Playing with him must be rather interesting! I know getting mowed over by my Pit, when he is happy, can be rather intense! But from this Clifford, wow! Sending good vibes to you and your fur babies!
Good golly, Miss Molly
The other dog seems pretty happy about it.
omg!! Reminds me of my childhood pet oso, its spanish for bear because he was as big as a bear lol. He was always there for me and my mom said he even stopped her from falling when she was pregnant with me. Miss ya, buddy ♡♡
I think it is too much love.  This once happened to a dog named Clifford.  He's red.
His poop is bigger than his owners, lol
That’s a nice horse you got there!
I wont lie, the other lil dude down to the right kinda looks like a hyena at first glance.
What a beautiful horse you have!
That’s not even a dog anymore, that’s a goddamn horse
Lol the other dog is so exited!
Someone has replaced your dog with a horse!
Have to bring a glad garbage bag on walks for his dinosaur sized poops.
I don’t know it’s because I’m high or because I’m crazy, but that is abteaalyblargecdof.
I'm a fan of big dogs (I do have a 80+ lb coonhound, not quite the size of your dane.)

My girlfriend would love a Bernese Mountain Dog.



BUT she can't do it. I would love to live in a world where the larger the dog, the longer they live. But unfortunately it tends to work out the opposite :-(

So my coonhound is 9 now, and definitely showing his age in the form of little fatty tumors and little bumps all over. And I get them checked now, nothing cancerous, just normal stuff, but still aging and sad.

GF and I got an Aussie last year. That is definitely as small as I would like to go. But happy their lifespan should be a bit longer. She's always making jokes like "15 years? No. She needs to live forever. Or at least longer than me."


As for your big boy... make sure you keep him lean or healthy. His joints will thank you later.
Has he been neutered?
He will win next years Triple Crown. Guarantee it!
Why did you shave your bear?
r/AbsoluteUnits
Holy Mother of God! What a MAGNIFICENT canine.  Is he Great Dane mixed with Moose? Extraordinary.

And your 'little guy' in the right hand corner is adorable.
r/absoluteunit
He's sitting there all sad like, "I can't help it :("
The other dog lol
Omg
The smaller one is looking at the camera as to say " He will soon overpower our containment measures"
...Clifford?
No help, I send treats.
[mfw I see a cute doggo](https://i.imgur.com/vQDUfRT.jpg)
my friend has a great dane, though not as big, he seems to not realize his own size and he's ultra-friendly. it's not fun being charged by a 50kg dog and still thinks he's a lap dog.
You could ride that thing into battle.
are we all just gonna ignore the fact that this man has The Beast from Sandlot in his home?
r/abosluteunit
He is the most ADORABLE giant monster dog! ( and I do NOT want to pick up his poop)
Him a big pupper. Give headpats.
MastiPony.

I Love you other dogs expression too.
My favorite part of this is the cheerful normal sized dog
That's what happens when you adopt a horse instead of a dog.
I like how the other dog is like "What the fuck is going on here?"
The love made Clifford grow so big, that the Howards had to leave their home.
Ruh-ro raggy
Absolute unit.
Kinda of expected when you get that breed. Now what would be impressive is if you had a chihuahua that size.
He looks like he's wondering what's going on but he's still ok with it.
That's what he said.
Yeah, the other dog stole the show lol.
Lowkey that bottom right dog's face looks like KekW twitch emote lol.
That's a cute horse you got there
You have one.look down there is another one
Just buy a saddle...
That’s the biggest freaking Chihuahua I’ve ever seen, Jesus!
Oh no, his poor heart
You just know he's a big Crybaby too.
how big of a pooper scooper do you need for that pup!?
How much, the #'s
His name is Moose, right?
Bruh I legit thought this was a mini horse from the thumbnail. You are carrying a horse.
Maybe you ended up with a horse by mistake
Send dog food you mean.
Are there a bunch of kids playing baseball behind your house? In the sandlot? Lol
Houses with dogs = great places to be.
What are you feeding that big boi?
Someone please make this into a meme. Bottom right is amazing
The doggo in the right corner " Muh next :D "
Those dogs only live like 6-8 years it’s kinda sad
That dog in the corner looks like fucking trevor from GTA V
Upvote for photobomb
My mother's coworker has a great dane and if got sick and had to go to the vet. She couldn't really lift him into the trunk of her car so she had to build a staircase out of wooden pallets for him.
"Ruh r'oh!"
That foal has a really strange head innit?
Dog on the bottom right could be a potential meme.
Rock Paper Scissors, loser picks up the butt...

Winner picks up the front... but, still gets drooled on.

*Source, have Great Dane mix*
Nice horse.
What a lovely horse,rather small though! 💖
He looks pretty safe to me.
Must be hard raise a horse indoors.
Have you tried washing him in some very very hot water and then putting him in the dryer? It worked for my favourite sweater.
When they say "Send help," but they really mean "Send food."
So, does he sleep in your bed?  And if so where do you two sleep?
Paint him red
“I’M HELPING!”

-dog in the bottom corner
At least the dog is getting enough love
What kind of horse is that
Bik chonk
Alright what are the poops like? Let's get down to brass tacks.
Great dane mastiff mix?
That’s the dog from The Sandlot. He has come...
Beautiful Mastiff pupper. Looks like around 14 months? Face is still puppy. Unless there's a Dane cross.
Seriously... You pick up its crap on a walk? That's gotta be twice the size of my poop. That's too much. Too much.
I’m sorry it looks like you’re going to have to put him down. I mean, look at him. He clearly doesn’t like being held like that. Let him walk around.
Pity they don’t hang around long...
I’m willing to bet you two are two tiny people..

Edit: I’d like to point out where the hand rail ends.
Beuford the big brown dog
Nice bear you've got there
plot twist: it's the dog in the bottom right corner
That's one absolute unit of a good boy.
Sorry, too busy. I accidentally shrunk the kids.
Problem? What problem
> Send help

No. He a good, growing boy.
I thought he was a Mastiff. Much love for all huge dogs.
Can't walk him alone, need 4 hands for that poop
What breed is he? Jesus he's massive, does he have a lot of energy??
How did you adopt Clifford's cousin? I'm jealous. He looks gorgeous.
Good looking pups!
You keep a horse in the basement?
Your little one is photogenic and looking faaabulous!
You bought a Dane, you've gotta live with a 7'4", 180lbs wannabe horse.
I want one just like this.
What a beautiful beast
Quit loving him so much that how Clifford's happen.
We ended up with the runt of our litter. 2.5 years old and 115lbs
 I'm OK with her size. How big is he?
The big he is the more to love
That dawg's name better be Moose.
Dog: are we done yet?
Try Coffee!
That’s a Scooby-Don’t.
No. I don’t think I will.
What a beautiful boy!!
Ok I’ll take him off your hands
Have you considered a stable?
Nice horse you got there
Stop watering him
hooooo !!!! my baby ......I love you so much ..... I am so happy to see you with your nose ......I am wondering why we did not call you MIRACLE !!!!!
Such a cute little pupper!!
I can only send nudes. Will that suffice?
Goddamn
Its fucking scooby
So this is  the dog from The Sandlot
It’s a real life Clifford!
More like greatest dane.
Clifford is that you?
He’s just a little guy.
That’s a whole lotta ~~Rosie~~ puppy!
you keep a horse indoors?
Mastiffs are massive.
Is that a horsedog?
Have you tried loving him less?
That's the mythical version of the dog from Sandlot.
Doggo the great!
Send food?
Ok you can send him to my place.

It’s smaller than yours but I’ll be fine
Hercules
His such big size makes him look very cute
Clifford was smaller
Looks like my girl Lucy. She's dane mastiff mix <3
The beast
let it grow, so that u can use it as a warcraft mount in the future in case self-driving cars become self-conscious :v
Beautiful dogs. Beautiful stairs
Size for a saddle, $5 rides for the neighborhood kids. Easy money. This is r/AbsoluteUnits for sure.
I'm still waiting on the tremor brothers adopting a new fren.
Big boi in the arms, happy boi in the corner
What is the dog on the right? Looks a lot like my mutt.
Ahh just a wide angle lense
Just imagine the size of that horse’s... I mean... dog’s... shit!!!!
My, what a tiny horse.
Your backyard has got to be like a minefield.
This looks like. Painting...
Imagine the poops!!!
Mine 6 month bull bitch
How much food do you guys go through??
Mine weighs 140 lbs. surprise, Danes are big.
Your other dog there thinks it's funny.
What breed is he
Everytime you look at the picture you find something else hilarious..for instance, that other dogs face!!
So much dog!
FOR... EV... VER...
Is that a horse
And the best thing about the pic is the other dog's photo bomb 🤣
Dog on the right looks like a good dude.
I love how the other dog seems pissed about the whole ordeal!
You shouldn't pick up your horse like that.
r/bigboye
He must have some crocodile blood in his ancestry?
I feel like you have to use trash bags and not poop bags and it scares me a little 


But also I love him!!!
OP, could you please show us what your big pup looked like as a puppy? I want to see how massive his paws were as a little guy!
It's a fur beast.
The other dog seems so joyful!
Aww, cute picture! Also random question, but what kind of breed is the doggy to the right? He/she looks exactly like our rescue but we still can't figure out what kind of breed he is! (His adoption papers said German Shepard/Lab mix but after he stopped growing our vet suggested he was a Puggle lmao)
Everyday I hope to see someone I know on Reddit. I never do. Finally I see someone I know!!! SCOOBY DOO! THERE ARE YOU!
I love how proud the second dog is hahah
A saddle could be useful you know
How much does he weigh?
Why did you buy a baby elephant?
The other doggo looks like he's playing a prank on all of them, and only the photographer knows about it. lol
That's a horse
Reminds me of a [Winsor Mckay](http://www.comicstriplibrary.org/images/comics/dream-of-the-rarebit-fiend/dream-of-the-rarebit-fiend-19050308-l.png) strip
Well I see she got the ass end of the deal.
r/humansforscale
Has he chewed nice things?
I came across a mastiff Great Dane mix one time and his name was Bubbles.
I saw one of these at the dog park and it decided to mark a chair as it’s territory. This dog lifted it leg over the chair and peed on the seat of it. My dog is large but is dwarfed by these magnificent beauties.
All smiles say no help is needed
You can always recoup some money with children party pony rides
He's fucking GORGEOUS 😍
Greatest Dane
The other dog is so proud of his/her sibling lol
so cute
Oh Jesus
The dog on the bottom is such a mood. Looking happy af. Lol
lmao at the dog in the front
look at my horse

my horse is amazing
I can help. You can give him to me and you can visit any time you want 🤣
It's bc you love him so much of course
Is that the other dog speaking?
Sad that these dogs have such bad health problems and short lives due to their size. I hope you do the doggy world a favor and have this one spayed/neutered!
MARMADUKE
But he’s just a wittle, tiny puppy. And a good looking one too!
He looks so confused. Makes it more awww
Beautiful dog keep his hips healthy!
HUUUUGEEEE
Oh shit !!! He's HUGE ! 😯😮
He's a gentle giant.  What a beautiful dog.
He is getting close to Zeus the Great Dane.  That boy is BIG.
We’re gonna need a bigger shovel
Oh Emily Elizabeth, what have you done!?
That’s a damn dinosaur!
You mean send food. How do you feed that beast?!
Your dog is fucking huge. What the fuck
I hate big dogs. All big and slobbery....(just getting those pricks
Back for hating on my small breed).
How much syndication does he make from The Sandlot?
His fucking foot is longer than her thigh
Dog in the front stealing the show with that model smile.
Have you seen the shape? Its more like a horse! Bears are a lot more round!
The whole sandlot at once: “the beast.”
Fellow dane owner here.  Love it!
tonight I watched A Dogs Journey ... I think that big guy would enjoy it
Mudge?

How is this a problem??
I think it might be time for you to look into a good deal on real estate on Birdwell Island.
Put the bong down raggy
He’s a good boy!
Maybe it's not a big dog, maybe you are tiny humans 🤔
Looks like Hercules from Sandlot!
Send this to r/whatswrongwithyourhorse
Brewski seems casually impressed by his ability to float.

Also Brewski: UNLIMITED POWER!!!!!!!!!
that is so cool! Will he grow any bigger you think?
That’s not a dog, that’s a tank.
thats one big boi
Did u know he was mastiff from the start. Or did the seller pull that labradoodlchihihuahua shit?

Big boi, BIG loving. Can't go wrong. Good luck.

Edit. Great Dane. You still have big boi loving coming at you. Unless it's a girl.
Love the family photo! Even the smaller one knows to smile.
Right corner steals it!!
Is that the dog from the sandlot?
Who let the horse in the house
FOR-EV-VER
Did you know your staircase kind of looks like Mrs. Dekels' staircase from, "Gremlins?" It's missing a chair.
Legs for days, drooling for weeks
This is the opposite of a problem. Small horsie 😍
The bigger the juicier
I love him very much.
That's no dog...that's a dire wolf
A doggo that grows endlessly? Sounds like you've adopted Fenris.
That doggie is a cultivating mass
"Humans...why are you picking me up? It is...not dignified."

That dog, right there.
All I see are puppies look at those pudgy little faces :D
Call Guinness.
Is that a great dane?
I'm surprised a dog that big is cool with being picked up
His body is just trying to keep up with his heart!
Where is the banana for scale?!
More like - send him to me please.
Maybe stop feeding him his greens, that's how I avoided growing big and strong. I'm a full adult and just mediocre.
Why are you giving him so much DGH? (Dog growth hormones) Kidding, you all look happy and healthy:)
Do bigger dogos have bigger doodoos
Only if you send help first!  Our boy, Mac, is just over a year and clearing the kitchen counters with his tail.  😁

Puppy! https://imgur.com/gallery/NooIgqZ

ETA:. Also, your dogs are gorgeous!
horse doggo
Felt cute... might poop on your front lawn later
Hercules
His dumps must be monstrous. 💩
I like the photo bomber lol
I want to see the size of his poop.
Ur right dog looks like Risitas
All the neighborhood kids are going to be scared to ask for they're baseball back
Hercules Morse
He thinks he’s people
IDK, looks kinda small to me.  I mean how big are horses supposed to be anyway?
Is this one of those stress ponies I’ve heard so much about lately?
Holy mother of Pearl! He's a big 'un
Pretty soon he's going to start hoarding baseballs  and kids will be too scared to jump the fence and get them back.
I can’t imagine the size of the turds this lad makes.
Oh Lord, you're loving him too much. Hell be bigger than your house!
Have you considered painting him red and naming him clifford?
What the hell are you feeding him?  Steroids?  Other dogs?
Whenever a big dog is picked up they just look like "why are you picking me up"?
r/absoluteunit
Just get a saddle. He'll be big enough to ride in no time.
op what's his/her breed?
Marmaduke, but for real
Please tell me his name is Marmaduke

Edit: discovered it's Brewski which is awesome
Dog too big
Nice horse.
DOGS!!!!
Adorbs
Still cute
The Beast
MARMADUKE IS THAT YOU
How much to feed the dog but he’s so beautiful wow could not believe my own eyes
Damn, that guy is a horse
How big is the poop?
Nice horse
Is that a horse or a dog? Jk he's gigantic!! What the heck do you feed him?
That’s a horse
Lad and a half
Well you will be saving on car costs once he grows just a little bit more, then you can ride that horse to work...
Dear God!
I'm sorry to tell you but that is not a dog..... That is a horse
This not dog, it's a war horse!
Isn't this the beast from Sandlot?
That’s a horse.
Does he think he’s the same size as your morkie?
You know how some reptiles keep growing through their lives almost seeming to grow to fit the size of their environment?

I suggest getting a smaller home.
I don't think I could cope with having a dog whose legs were longer than mine.

And weighed more than me.

And had to eat from a horse trough instead of a dog bowl.
Its The Beast aka Hercules
O l) l0 l9
The size of his body is proportional to the size of his heart.
His poops must be massive
Form of - Horse!
We had a 220lb English mastiff/ Great Dane cross. Giant breeds are a pita to care for.
Sooby!!
Short people? How tall is one stair so I can scale it?
What kind of dog is it?
and send dog food
That dog food budget must be massive 😦
If world war 3 happens I would ride this good boi to the battle.
MARMADUKE
So dinosaurs are back then....nice
Stop lying that’s a horse
Cool! A baby horse!
Well, what were you thinking? That's a pony!

He's a descendant of those Dark Souls skeleton dogs, no doubt! lol

Nice dogs. :)
Well you guys will never have to worry about being robbed. One peek through a window to see this big guy and it's gonna be a no for them dawg.
Harvest him for meat.
You guys are doin the lords work.... Great puppy parents!
Thank you for not cropping his ears. Beautiful!

That's a fine horse you got yourself there.
I’ll take him if u don’t want him ;)
Man I bet it sucks hard to clean up that dog's dumps in your backyard. Bigtime.
He is beautiful
When does it stop being a pet and become livestock? What's that line?
For some reason i imagine his farts smelling terrible.
Clifford with an edge
Omg. It's Clifford.
The other dog is like haha dad and mom manhandling brutus again.
But the fella down there never stops smiling ☺️
I want one
Imagine the growing pains he went through
It’s The Beast!! From the movie Sandlot!
I’m afraid you accidentally bought a horse.

I didn't know I needed to see this until now
That second guy look8ng at the camera be like:End my suffering i want to be the poved one
What kind of dog is that??
You love him too much haven't you seen the cowardly dog?
His feet will hit the floor eventually. Sorry you have to hold him until then.
Your giving him to much love, you gotta stop before he gets big enough to rival Clifford.
Fuck, your life is like way, way better than mine haha.
Oh I like this one... One dog goes one way, the other dog goes the other way, and this guy's sayin', "Whadda ya want from me?'
Hope he doesn't shit in the floor.
all I can think of is the size his dumps must be each day
Have you considered making an honest woman out of her?
Awwww Giant fur baby 😍😍😍
The other dog is a great reference ....
Bless his giant dog heart
hahahaha
Is he good boi
How old is he/she? 5 months?
Clifford?
So when does he turn red?
I love my Dane too! They are the best dogs. Their mentality is just great
The great hambino
Wow! You can ride that to work!
What kind of dog is this?
Clifford needed Emily
So she chose him for her own
And her love made Clifford grow so big
that the Howards had to leave their home
Clifford's the best friend,
anyone could know!
He's the greatest dog ever!
I really think so!
Clifford's so loyal,
He's there when ya call.
I love Clifford, the big red dog!
That's a fine horse you have there... 🐎
I Neeeed this dog
145?
How about sending a saddle?
Will not send help. Will come hang out with your small horse.
Do you guys play Rock-paper-scissor to determine who gets the ass end?
Ulgy looking dog before they shaved the mane off!
Is it a horse?
when he goes berserk it's going to be glorious
Big boi
large
OMG! This is so huge.
I love the look on the other dogs face.
He definitely needs a tie.
I bet she wanted the front end, but then the realities of physics set in :P

Marmaduke, I haven't seen you since the 70s.  Glad to see you're still doing well.
Is this an english mastiff?
Approximately how much does it cost to feed him per week?
