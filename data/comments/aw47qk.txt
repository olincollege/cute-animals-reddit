Imagine being the hedgehog just trying to cross the field minding your own business when suddenly a group of gigantic furry long necked creatures just show up and lean over checking you out all up in your face and they're all clearly somewhat terrified of you but they're so curious that they're suppressing it?
Woah, that’s one big hedgehog!
"Aww look at him, he's so cute"

"He's coming towards you Dave"

"Yeah he's cute, ill give him a kiss"

"I wouldn't"

"Ouch prickly mother fucker"
As someone from the states, from a state where these prickly cutie pies aren't even legal, it still is a mind blowing moment to realize these things just... live WILD somewhere. Hedgehogs are so cute!
I just realized Alpacas look super weird.  The way their necks are moving makes me uncomfortable.
Alpacas are like horse dogs.
Jeffrey dean morgan has a huge farm and rescues a bunch of these things. Now I can’t look at negan without thinking about how awesome of a person he is
"Hello, prickly friend." 
‘Will you lot fuck off and leave me alone?’
As a human that loves to watch animals and is always very curious, I love watching when other species do the same thing.  Watching different species interacting is fascinating to me and, to me, illustrates some of the sameness among all animals.
Hedgehog sees you sniffin' hedgehog don't care.

That one alpaca that gets scared like "what is this... What... OH GOD OH FUCK.... Oh nevermind, whew..."
I can't believe we live in a world where both alpacas and hedgehogs are completely real animals. this shits ridiculous lmao 
Thank you OP for using the correct version of “pique” in the title!  (Former English teacher here)
TINA, COME GET SOME HAM!
TIL that it’s “piqued” and not “peaked”. I always (incorrectly) assumed it meant that you maxed out my curiosity versus the correct meaning of you stimulated my curiosity 
hi, little fren! how do you do?

we here alpacas -  what're you?

we see no legs, n where's your neck?

How do you *move* ? Woah - What the HECK?!

them things are Sharp there on your back!

do you PROTEC ?

or do ATTAC ? ?



i guess we gonna never know

sorry, 'fren' - you gotta go

you kinda sad . . . no tail to wag

(....but if you want.... ^alpaca ^bag ^^;)
That hedgehog isnt going that fast

&#x200B;
*Rare sighting* alpacas meet an ouch mouse and boops his back
"Pokey rock just poked me!!!!" 
Upvoted for proper use of 'piqued"!
That hedgehog is huge!
Always appreciate the possessive plural apostrophe.
What I'm impressed by is how the alpacas manage to squeeze by each other without pushing, *let alone brushing* by one another. Crazy cool herd animal trait.
ROLLIN AROUND AT THE SPEED OF SOUND
They’re like fashionable sheep. 
The ouch mouse has arrived 
When 1 person in the whole class revised, but they're selfish.
Alpacas are 1000x cuter when unshorn 
"You seein' this shit?"

\- Left Alpaca
TIL it’s “piqued my interest” not “peaked my interest”
Can someone explain why herd animals are so curious? The rule of thumb is predators are smarter than prey, and there's plenty of evidence for this, but what I don't quite understand is why herd animals seem far more curious than anything else. (cept maybe birds, lord knows parrots love checking out noise sources and lord knows crows/ravens love shiny shit or anything that might lead to food)

Only thing I can think of is it'd make sense to check things out that seem different from their norm their used to, and perhaps they'd only show this curiousity in the comfort of the rest of the herd. Like perhaps if this was just one Alpaca alone, he'd be far more stand-off-ish, and it's only when they have strength in numbers that they check stuff like this out for security reasons...?
I never knew Alpacas had all the finesse and grace of a drinking bird toy 
I was afraid the whole video that they were gonna stomp the lil guy
It's like if a mop met a bristle brush.
[Where. is. your. butt?](https://gfycat.com/hugewhichbarasinga-doggo-dog-shiba-inu-hedgehog-pupper)
I love how the hedgie is just walking along, minding his own business, while all the alpacas are kind of going, "What dis? We must follow it! See what it is!"
The hedgehog be like "I guess alpaca my bags and leave"
Is that an enormous hedgehog or tiny alpacas?
Dimmsdale?
Alapacas are the biggest wusses. They act this way with a beach ball. 
"Dolly and Dot are my best friends.."
I love alpacas! Ostrich Sheep.
Bunny ears, Lamb head,  Brachiosaurus neck, Donkey body, Giraffe legs, Dog tail. An Alpaca is like a child's drawing come to life. So effing cute good lord!
They look like those little water bird machines that bob up and down.
Is there a subreddit for videos like this? Where an animal is curious/confused about something it's never seen before?
A chill hedgehog given he's being stalked by the herd of giants.
My two year old: “what’s THAT?”

Me: “that’s an alpaca.”

2: “Oh! Al-taco!”
I saw a group of them do the same for a cat. Litterally ran over to check it out and stood in a semi circle around it. 

I get the feeling they are like this for any animal that looks different and smaller than them. 
Why is sanic out in the open?
“Oh my god Frank, Tribbles ARE real... except I remember them looking more FLOOF on tv.” 
We have them in Poland too one night when I was waking I saw one in the middle of the road so I ran over and used my feet to help it move to the side as I saw a few cars coming up the hill. He was a bit pissed hissing at me but I got him to the curb safely and he was on his way into the grass.
And so he walked through the valley of fluff.
Alpacas are some weird looking animals

The new sonic moving is looking good 
Hi Carl. 
Giraffe sheep 
TIL its piqued not peaked 
Id love to hear Snoop Dogg narrate this...
I wish I could give two upvotes, one for cute animals and the other for correctly spelling "piqued".

Upvote for not spelling piqued as peaked. Also the alpacas are kinda cool.
Who would win? A heard of alpacas or one spiky boi 
That's intelligence for you...on both sides of the spectrum. 
That first one was like, “Excuse me, what the f- AHHHH!”
Spikey boi confuse the sheep horses. 
Alpacas got some sick haircuts
Sonic is like this is my day off guys, chill.
Don't ya just hate when the neighborhood changes all of a sudden, and all ya want is to get through it.
First Alpaca nopes real hard  
i have a pet rat and 2 dogs. my dogs are like the exact same thing as the alpacas

That's a fucking vantablack alpaca right there
I recently purchased a hand-sewn, Peruvian alpaca sweater and it is so damn warm and comfortable. I highly recommend.

Edit: I got some upvotes so I thought I should also share the awesome store in Lake Tahoe where I bought said sweater. https://www.tahoealpaca.com
Love how they black one rolls up like: "Hey ya'll what'd I, dayyymmm! what dis!"

Stupid hedgehog. I just wanted to welcome you properly and all I got was stabbied in the nose.
Oh lawd! He movin! 😂
Never knew that hedgehogs look like large rolly pollies.
Frat guys at the bar when a freshman girl walks in.
I like the second Alapaca to the left of the screen. That Alapaca has long sweeping bangs/fringes where you can't see the eyes. He seems pretty calm and chilled.

Emperor’s new groove 2 electric boogaloos looks sweet.
You should be careful! Wild alpacas are vicious pack animals and would make light work of even the most prickly of hedgehogs. That hedgehog should be thanking its lucky stars that it escaped unscathed.
I like how the hedgehog is completely indifferent. 
Well at least you spelled “piqued” correctly
Ma! Ma get over here there a weird looking cat I’ve here! Ma!
Anybody notices how in the beginning whenever an alpaca lowers its head to inspect the hedgehog it tucks its head in briefly?
That's a big ass hedgehog
May they bless the ground that he walks
i want to touch it
 oh my goddd it’s so smol + shy 😭😭💕
I like this a lot. 
The start of the alpacalipse 
Alpacas look like teddy bear versions of a giraffe.  
Is that how you’re supposed to spell piqued when using it like that?  I thought it was still peaked. 
Please someone do a r/behindthegifs using this!

There's no sound yet I can hear what noises the hedgehog is making in my head.

Out of my way, peasants. 
Awesome, hehe. Reminds me of the [Pokey boy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalTextGifs/comments/arshw0/pokey_frein_meets_confused_puppo/) gif from a while ago (one of my favorites).
They’re acting like a herd of cats
Those are giraffe-doggos
Were this a group of llamas, you could have alternatively titled it "How to alarm a llama".
“Um excuse me sir, but what is you ?”
[removed]
I love alpacas now.
That's awesome
This needs a voice over.
They're wondering if the hedgie will get shorn too.  
That hedgehog is so chill walking past them, zero fucks given 
At least one of them found out it has pointy things
I wonder what the hedgehog thinks.
Sonic is way faster.
Hedgehog DGAF
Second time I’ve seen Carl now 
So... honest question... what’s the point of this animal? Like why do we keep Alpacas?
I love everything about this
I love how at the end the 2 alpacas hold back from the group and look like they're discussing wtf is going on 
“What is it!?  What does it want!?”
Flat camel bamboozled by ouch mouse.
Amazing how these Alpacas can react to the speed of sound
"HOLY SHIT"

"Calm down Bill you're like 10x its size"

"You're right you're right, let me just get another loo- HOLY FUCK" 
CaAaAaARRRRLLLLL
hedgehog is unphased 
West Lorian Alpacas are known for their politeness throughout all of Fillory.
I like how courage spreads through the alpacas after a couple of them are brave enough to be the first to get close to the little prickly ouchmouse.
I never knew their necks were so  *l o n g*  haha
Cross post as a request to r/animaltextgifs
I hear he's some kinda kissyboy
I didn't know I wanted an alpaca until right now.
I expected the hedgehog to be MUCH faster....
"yo niga you chekin this?"
Sonic is so slow in there.
When you are the only guy at a party.
I have a mental image of a bunch of teenagers with spiky hair checking out some curious shit and daring each other to touch it.
Alapacas look like moms who wear velour sweat suits.
Aww he‘s so cuuutteeeOHHHH FUCK WHAT IS THAT
"Oooh, he's pointy!" - Alpacas
They just need to add a sloth and then it would be perfect!
Alpacas' kind of look like a kids drawing of a poodle. The proportions are all wrong, but they're fluffy. So I mean it's close enough. 
"No thanks, alpaca lunch next time"
I had to back up and check the sub, i thought that fella was going to get stomped.
Now thahts the slowest hedgehog I ever did see
Either alpacas are smaller than they look, or hedgehogs are bigger than I thought.
i love this
Adorable!
r/animaltextgifs is going to love this
I want to hug all of them
The alpacas' movements reminds me of those bird desk toys that "drink" water. 
Can’t believe alpacas are real. Just look at them. 
"Get outta my way you overgrown Swiffers!"
Somebody should create an Animal Text GIF version of this!
*spits in excitement* 
Caaaaaaaaarl
I have questions. Where did the hedgehog come from? Where is it going? Do alpacas eat hedgehogs? 
What a strange animal it’s like a mini giraffe poodle goat. I need to buy some land and raise alpacas, maybe I can make sweaters and beanies and sell them for weed and food
Imagine stumbling upon a circle of thirty alpacas standing around and spitting on a hedgehog 
Is it bad that people say “peaked” instead of “piqued” so often that I wanted to congratulate you for using the correct word? 

I love me some giraffe sheep.
Donkeypoodles are confused.
They have the best natural hair-do lol. 
"piqued" by a hedgehog hehehe
Ouch mouse😁
Bro stop wait no no no dont kill it dont kill it
Alpacas are just sheep with long necks.
Do people eat this animal??
Worried this was going to be a remake of [Bambi vs. Godzilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-wUdetAAlY). Whew.
Ive never seen a hedghog before but they seem so cute i really want to see one!! 
Do all alpacas wear the “It’s not a phase, mom!”
haircut?
You guys are playing it like the alpacas are drunk frat dudes. I saw a special screening of "Gone with the Wind" last night.

I have a different narrative in my head-- old southern women.

"What in the world?" "Oh, mah, mah mah." (when it scares them): "LAWD HAVE MUCY!"

Hedgehog is going through them thinking. “Gotta go fast! Fast! Faster Faster! Faster!”
Oh my gosh I love hedgehog friend going doot doot doot through the forest of Alpaca legs.
For you, the day a hedgehog graced your village was the most important day of your life. But for him, it was Tuesday.
I was half expecting one of them to stomp it, but then again I don’t know a damn thing about alpaca behavior. Just seems like it could have been on the table given their freaked out reactions. 
I love how they start following it like this is our new leader 
This is a /u/OzzyManReviews video in the making if I've ever seen one, can just imagine his commentary already.
What kind of dogs are these and why is that brush moving!?
They look like they might be pretty... Chile

Bonus points for using ‘piqued’ instead of ‘peaked’ 

For all intensive purposes, fauxcabulary is destroying the English language irregardless of how real they sound

:)
This is like the cow and the turtle 
Wondering who’s more curious ! Give it a way, give it a way !!! 
“Woah! You see that? It almost got me!”


“.. naw, I didn’t see it” 


“Crazy, like it was so close!”


“Didn’t see..” 


“You saw that, right!?” 


Sigh “yeah, bro. I saw it. So crazy” 


“RIGHT!?!” 


Two years later in a Llama bar: “so that’s what happened! Don’t believe me? John was there. He’ll tell you” 


“..yeah, it was crazy”


Do ppl eat alpacas or are they just used for wool? 
Wow 
r/youseeingthisshit
Dinsdale!
I always thought hedgehogs were fast for some reason 
Those dogs have seriously long necks
GO Sonic 😎
This has just made me realise how much more practical having an extremely long neck is. Not one of them struggled to get a look. Imagine that at the football. 
Accidently walking into a field of Alpacas at night must be terrifying.
CAAAARL
OP, I really needed this. Thanks.
r/youseeingthisshit
OMG that's adorable, I love how they're leaning in to look closer!  And you spelled "piqued" correctly so this post is extra-awesome.
I didn't realize alpacas were quite that big.  those are some tall sheep-horses.
This is excellent, but tbh I'm more thrilled by the caption that uses the word "piqued" correctly. 
Thank you for using "piqued" properly. Also the gif is good.
 Woah 
Their curiosity and the hedgehog's nonchalantness just make this too cute. 
Extra points for "pique" stealth pun in title (and correct spelling)

Good thing there llama guard wasn't around or that thing may have gotten stomped. (Some people use llama's to guard their alpacas as the llama's are aggresive towards threats)
Aren’t those llamas? I thought alpacas were smaller and had cuter faces. 
Reminds me of a rumba!
Either hedgehogs are a lot bigger than i thought, or alpacas are a lot smaller than i thought.
...THAT’S A BIG FUCKING HEDGEHOG!
I really thought this was a pack of giant alpacas at first..I was sadly disappointed  when he stood up and realized they were not:/

Imagine how weird this would be for the hedgehog to have these giants cautiously examining them. Spines are a good deterrent, but they could totally kill the hedgehog if they were determined to do so.

thats so sweet i hope they dont kill it

Alapacas "He keeps saying that but he is still going the same speed."

Who sheared those Alpacas? Stevie Wonder? 
I can’t see alpacas without thinking of my niece. She’s obsessed with owls (this is relevant - bear with me) and every year insists on going to an owl rescue centre for her birthday. 
They have loads of owls but also other rescues just roaming around in about 2 acres of land - pigs, horses, goats, chickens, sheep...and alpacas. 
The first year we went she was 4 and got really excited and shouted my brother over to look at the alpacas - “DADDY! Giraffes!” It was just really sweet and innocent. Also, cute hedgehog :-)
I hope to see this on /r/animaltextgifs soon...
The animal equivalent of playing with fire. 
I'll never forget being in the DR walking my small brown dog and stumbling accross about 20 cows asleep in the shade. Before I could call her back she ran over to see what they were. They got startled and got up, so she ran away. At first just one cow followed, then eventually all of them. She got scared and ran, and they chased. After a while she stopped, and they did too. Then she started walking towards them sniffing and starting to wag her tail. They all ran, so she chased them. This went back and forth FOR EVER. Finally we left, and they followed us for a really long time.
Are those baby Alpacas? Or is that gave they normally look like lol they're awkward beings but so cute
All of those alpaca are saying "Hmmm?"

Because that's the sound they make :o
It's like a cult now.
That Hedgehog is Chanting “Baa, Ram, Ewe! Bas, Ram Ewe!”
Fuck that’s how you spell piqued... I always spelt it peaked for all these years. Everything is a lie.
Damn that’s racist only one black alpaca there

Never realized how long alpaca necks are until now. They're like mini giraffes.

It sort of looks like a creeping prickly rock...
That hedgehog is lucky those aren't horses - it'd be stomped flat!

oh wait never mind never jump to conclusions people
AN hedgehog
Who would win? Several long bois or one prickly boi? 
Does any animal give a more scathing judgement than the alpaca? They always look like they want to speak to the manager!

This is really keeping them from being able to focus on their art.

I was wondering how you managed to get your username and woah- 8 year account.
Hope the little guy is ok, tends to be if you see a wild hedgehog in the day it may have some kind of problem.

Hedgehogs are in massive decline in the UK, so if anyone sees one out in the day time, please look up and contact a local hedgehog sanctuary, especially if they're small.

This guy looks fat and healthy though so he should be alright!

This is a dramatization of their conversation:

TIL that alpacas are short-sighted and have to lean in close to see things /s

I also learned that some people use peaked instead of piqued, from the comments. I’ve actually never seen that done before.
"hmm.  it's a walking currycomb...."
I don't know what they're saying, can someone add subtitles for me?

Alpacas are some of the sweetest animals. 
🤔
That one walking in front of the camera like they're at a swimming pool.
Wow. I only have seen Alapacas before in rimworld and I didn’t know they were real lol. 
Obviously not Sonic.
its carl from instagram 
Reminds me of MINE from finding Nemo

Skip to 46 seconds and play. 
thats what i love about animals, they could all stomp it, but instead they just sniff at it and get scared

It looks like a giant rolly-polly 
2nd Alpaca from the left's hair is on point!
I LOVE Alpacas!! My 2nd favourite animal!
u/tallianna
Now where is the animal text version?  
All bow to the king! 
Can you ride one of these?? 
Aren't these Lamas?
It is how i feel when i start a new school
“What the heck is it?”
Good gracious Alpacas are cute!
I'm really envious of people who live around animals :(. Wish I could randomly walk by alpacas and hedgehogs myself.
That one Alpaca that walked by reminds me of that fat woman that walked across the swimming pool ....r/photoshopbattles 
Caaaaarl what is that thing!?
Is this on Mt. Alpaca?
Cuties, the lot of em!
This looks like Skyrim AI...
I love how so many species of animals learn so much about the world through smelling shit. I wish our sense of smell was this complex 
On our farm, our alpacas lose their shit if anything on the ground moves sjjd
Gotta go fast
 Farm for sale in Egypt 200 acres at a price of 6 million and 215 thousand dollars  
 N/00201091860606
They are bowing to their master
The innocence of these Alpacas is too adorable.
r/youseeingthisshit
I always thought it was peaked. I should read more...
I can already see the Ozzy Man Reviews video coming for this. [Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFRLtwH8jlY)

Gotta go fast! 
Like an alpaca Pied Piper
“We bid thee farewell and safe travels, Hedgehog,” bowed the Alpacas. 
I can just hear them like the villagers from Minecraft 
They’re like little kids, lol. 
Is there a sub-Reddit that just deals with animals meeting other animals?

There's gotta be.
wow amazing video !!
Please tell me no one got hurt
Those two that come RUNNING over to see what’s going on - emergency hedgehog viewing!
Ron Jeremy and a crowd of women.
Thought that was a roomba at first
thicc ouch mouse
Are alpacas near sighted or why do they move their heads so close?
It's looks like a fucking Roomba
I worked with alpacas for six years. I respected them, gave them great care and even affection, but I don't like working with them one fucking bit. I enjoyed the nurturing part, but I just didn't feel that they had the mental capacity to love back. 
Fool me once....shame on....”Oooooh, what’s that...let me touch i....ouch! Dooohhhh! I did it again.”
[Hedgehogs defecate while they run faaaaaaast](https://youtu.be/TvNEZ4WWQIk) 
When designing these creatures how did evolution settle here and say "yes this is optimal"
OMG OMG it's moving!!  But first, let me smell it
This is too damn cute.  Who knew hedgehogs were alpaca whisperers?  Let me show you the way...follow me...
This is the most disgusting, unnatural thing that I have ever seen
Alpaca? I hardly know a!
They're like giraffe, cat cows.
Cute!!
Poodle + dinosaur
I need one of those in my life
Alpaca 1”It appears to be a spiked ball” Alpaca 2 “ I’ll touch it”  Alpaca 2“ahhhhh! It moved!” Alpaca 3 “it has eyes!”  all alpacas “run!!!”
Is it really piqued? 
Maybe the Alpaca was just booping the hedgehog 
Thinkin' about all that alpaca wool.

/r/rimworld
How in hell do you have 3M karma?!??!
I love that everyone gathered around to investigate 
I'd have given anything to see the hedgehog just turn around really quickly when all of them were following behind. Given how jumpy the were, they'd have completely freaked out...lol
u/peace-enthusiast
Oh snap that's sharp
Sonic has gotten slow in his old age
What did alpacas evolve from 
What type of pokemon is this ? 
- Probably the alapaca
Reminds me of “Ozzy Man Reviews: Cows VS Turtle
https://youtu.be/xFRLtwH8jlY
They all look like they wanna speak to the manager.
It smells like PAIN
Trying to figure out why a piece of ground is moving
The hedgehog is running away from those giant furry animals
I got really nervous when they get their noses really close down to it's spines because I was worried it would get it's nose pricked 
It’s Carl!
Needle mouse is unafraid of these giraffe sheep
The hedgehog has more followers than me
These are not alpacas, it's a rare giraffe x poodle breed
them being shaved makes it 47% better 
There’s a sign in my area for a llama farm that reads

“Our llamas are Outstanding in their field”

It’s hilarious
Can someone please do an r/AnimalTextGifs for this? Thx. 
I approve of this message
alpacas are so cute!
too much cuteness in one video
That's how my cats act when their sister turtle is out of her habitat hehe...
Is this hedgehog different then the ones people keep as pets or are all hedgehogs this size?Things a monster. 
Could be peeked, they all work for the situation actually so go nope yourself
The alpaca who looks right at the camera: "I have never seen this man before in my life"
Once I was at the zoo, and a raccoon had gotten into the giraffe enclosure. It freaked out when it saw the giraffe and scrambled back out under the fence, and the giraffe craned its head up over the fence to try to keep looking at it.  I liked that here's all these humans being like "check out this weird animal!" and the giraffe is like "what is this weird animal?".
Well now i know that hedgehogs > tanks
Alpaca alapaca
Alpacas AND a hedgehog!? What have I done to receive such a blessing?
#OMIGOSH,ITPOKEDMEH
Someone do a ghetto voice-over please

Good thing a donkey wasn't there
Ozzy man reviews? 
Thankyou so much, this wouldve usually been a r gifthatendedearly but you kept it going. (I purposely didnt r/ properly)
Alpaca 1- Is that Sanic?

Alpaca 2- Hmm
They have most humans beat. They were curious but never violent to the hedgehog just because he was different.🙂🙂🙂
I like how the hedgehogs curiosity couldn’t be piqued any less. 
Brown black white baige all curiously looking at the weird alien. Hmm!
Awe. That hedgehog is huge!
From the way the camera was positioned, those alpacas looked hug at first
Is it true that alpaca males will intentionally try to bite their enemy's balls off when fighting?
Ron Jeremy? Is that you?
