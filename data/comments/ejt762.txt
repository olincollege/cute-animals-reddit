Love it. Especially how they all turned up and were so polite waiting their turn.
3rd dog was like it's okay you dropped mine on the floor, but finger fed billy,. I love you anyway
The gangs great. Can‚Äôt wait for them to start there own detective agency.
This is what my animals all do when they hear the shredded cheese open.
Omg, each of your animals represents a character from ‚ÄúIts Always Sunny in Philadelphia‚Äù.

i wish i had a house big enough for five pets
The cat eating it is the best ü•∞
This made me so happy. I love their little anticipation noms
Everyone looks pretty healthily excited and sweet about this treat- everyone that is, EXCEPT the CAT. He is a clear addict and cannot be trusted alone in the kitchen.
Should they eat whipped cream ?
This sparks joy
Did this with my first cat, not everyday, but often enough.  She got a serious cavity and had to have a fang removed.  Don't give sugar to your pets, no matter how much they beg.
In order.

You have 2 dogs? Nice-

You have three?! 

Oh fou- 

FIVE!!!  TOO. CUTE.
While watching this video I caught myself stick out my tongue when the cream looked like it was gonna fall. lol
Dream home with doggos and kitties ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nice but maybe dont do it too often
Your technique tells me this isn‚Äôt your first rodeo
Legit don't know.

Is whip cream safe for cats and dogs?
I was expecting a bird to fly in, a raccoon to come out the trash, penguin slide from the fridge, Iguana out of the toilet, 

*sad Ace Ventura noises*
Next time you have an innocent visitor, ask them to use the whipped cream. They're gonna be in for a big surprise :D
That‚Äôs probs extremely bad for pets.
The cat is my favorite!
why would you give unhealthy food to your pets?
Aww best gang ever!! My own dogs do this when they know I‚Äôm making hot chocolate
How come some people have all the animals and I have no animals
Next episode, the gang gets diarrhea.
Stop feading sweet shit to your pets
That's cute and all but dont give adult animals dairy.
My cat would freaked out after hearing the hissing of that can lol
I can smell this house
I‚Äôm gonna go do this right now! Although o hated how thy little one licked the tip ewwww
My dog got diarrhea from whipped cream :(
i don‚Äôt get how the floors are so clean. Do you mop 
 every day? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Gave our cat whip cream once on thanksgiving.. now every time we eat, she silently stares at us, always waiting..
I love that cats tiny mouf
Oh my ... too many!
It‚Äôs funny how our spoiled pets learn the sound of a whipped cream can. üòÜ
Are you spraying whipped cream on soup?
Anyone else find this gross rather than aww?
The fact that an animal that walks on its toilet and roams around on your counter tops repulses me.
Milk/cream is incredibly bad for cats.  Don't give it to them.
Cats are special aliens. How can it be so sweet? üòç
Stealing u/scootcooties comment from farther down...

 >I'm a vet. Pelase don't feed sugar to your dogs and carts. They need sugar in the form of carbs, not processed sugar.

Do a [quick google search](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&ei=hXQQXrfEGIaWlwSi0biYCA&q=why+dogs+shouldn%27t+eat+sugar&oq=why+dogs+shouldn%27t+eat+sugar&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i10i30l2.919.4260..4380...0.0..0.87.) and see for yourself people.

>[Basically, dogs need sugar in the form of carbohydrates](https://www.healthypawspetinsurance.com/blog/2018/05/21/can-dogs-eat-sugar) just like humans, but do not feed your dog sugar, and try to avoid sweets.

>Natural sugar from fruit, called fructose, is safe for your dog (please note, however, that not all fruits are safe; grapes are toxic). Granulated and processed sugars on the other hand, are not healthy for your dog, whether that is in the form of a cube or a cookie. Dogs that eat a sugar are at risk for cavities, weight gain, metabolic conditions, liver issues, and diabetes. Each condition comes tethered to a host of other issues ‚Äì excess weight can lead to arthritis, cavities can lead to painful oral infections, and diabetes can lead to heart complications. So, it is probably best to skip the sugar!

>Milk and milk-based products can cause diarrhea and other digestive problems for your pup. They can also trigger food allergies, which can cause her to itch. and milk based products like whipped cread contain a lot of processed sugar.


>‚ÄúDogs need sugar of some sort. They need carbohydrates [which are broken down into sugar or glucose by the body] to live and operate. We just don‚Äôt need to be giving them candy since there‚Äôs no real added value.

It's alright not knowing things, but now you know, and if you don't believe me please do a quick Google search.


These animals are cute and lovely, but can please raise awareness how bad is sugar for animals? It's ok if some people weren't aware, but it's science, sugar makes animals sick. Now you know, please don't encourage feeding this shit to any animals, this video would be just as adorable if the owner gave them a healthy treat.
Great and shit but stop giving sugar to animals
Crazy how people can want so many animals .
The Gang Gets Cavities
Is this safe for cats? I was under the assumption they they are lactose intolerant. Awesome video still just curious.

There must be some mistake. Isn't the resident dog nutritionist here to say that whipped cream can cause brain cancer?

Cat on the counter is an absolute no-go
Oh how adorable!! Cuddles must be so great with that gang!
That's the most unhealthy thing you can do to your pets
Omg how unhealthy for All your animals!
How do you keep your house clean of pet hair?
How do you keep up with all that shedded hair? If I skip a day of brushing or vacuuming with just one Golden it‚Äôs like I might as well never done it in the first place.
Isn't chocolate poisonous to animals

That‚Äôs hilarious
Man creams entire party
You live in a zoo.
Okay, how do people afford so many pets?
Are they allowed?
My dog loves when I go to Starbucks. He knows he gets a pup cup. Plus they are free.
It's nice that you share with them.  It's a nice little treat for them.
Sounds like an episode of " Always Sunny in Philadelphia "
Don‚Äôt forget you can get free ‚Äúpup cups‚Äù at Starbucks for your little buddies!
That's like me, but with my kids.
I didn't pay attention to what sub this was, I thought the first cup contained soup or something savory because I saw chunks of something (now I see it's got chocolate with the tiny marshmallow. I'm colorblind), and OP was going to prank his buddies by letting them think it's hot chocolate when it's not.
The cat?? My cats won't touch anything that's not cat food - unless it's ham. That's about it. Interesting.
Thanks, my heart just melted a little
Whip your animals into shape!
Best part is that this has no sound. Bacause you can still hear the phiiisssssshhhhhhhhhh from that tube!
OMG, I love it!!!!! You are one of the best furry parents of so many furry children!!!!
This is my morning routine with me puppers! All 3 sit around me and wait. As soon as I start the coffee maker they come running.
This, this was the post that made me join this subreddit
That‚Äôs the cutest cat I‚Äôve ever seen
Omg, even the cat!
sick gang u got there
I was hoping the cat would just get a mound of whipped cream piled on his face
u/vredditdownloader
I think whipped cream is gross but this is so cute
i used to be addicted to nitrous too!
Who else was waiting for IASIP text?  Just me?
Your technique is flawed. Your supposed to get the nozzle into their mouths so it expands. Comedy ensues.
I love this sharing!
Sounds like a title of a Always Sunny episode.
So sweet and adorable!!!!
Our cat Ponyboy,  who's no longer with us,  loved bread, tortilla chips and potato chips.  He demanded you share if you sat down with any.
Holy shit you have a lot of animals I wanna be you someday
I want a gang like this
She‚Äôs done that before
Our cat LOVES whipped cream. Has loved it since he was a kitten. We call him by imitating the sound of the whipped cream can (psshhhht!)  He's 12 now and his belly can't handle it anymore so we can't give it to him.
Having the cat there remind me of Beasts of Burden.
In my home too, they hear the sound and they know they going to get some.
I need an it‚Äôs always sunny in Philadelphia  intro for this.
Lol I love it! Our dog knows the sound of the peanut butter jar opening & always comes running
"Everybody eats."
This home seems fun!
Easiest way to get my dogs to come running is getting the whipped cream outta the fridge.
Why are there little floaty bits in the first cup? ü§¢ü§Æ
Honey, why don't we ever have any whipped cream?!  Also why do the animals turn up like beggars when they smell got chocolate??
can i have some
Is that a house or is that heaven
First time pet owner here. Are whip creme safe for dogs? Like how much do you give them? Can you give them regularly?
Thats it, i have to make pancakes now !
I want to live with you. Need a roommate?
I love it!
What kind of dog is that very last one to be fed?
You get whipped cream! You get whipped cream! EVERYONE GETS WHIPPED CREAM
Cats are lactose intolerant.
Poor kitty bum.
I was waiting for the Sunny theme to kick in.
AVDURU!
this will literally be me when i move out and live on my own i will work all day then come home to my 5 children my golden doodle  my Burmese water dog my cat my  bichon friser
I do the same with my dog. He hears me spray it for myself and will appear in just seconds to get a treat too.
I didn‚Äôt think the cat would go for it
That is maximum level spoiled! I can sympathize. My husband can‚Äôt eat string cheese without having to give a piece to our cat. He‚Äôs also turned her on to McDonald‚Äôs French fries,

She also demands I share Goldfish crackers, mashed potatoes, or macaroni.

And twice a day, she requires ice cubes (2 minimum) in her water bowl or we hear about it!
Okay but like that's a nice kitchen
Omg that's so adorable

Soo many animals, and they are all so polite!
This is the kind of content were all here for.
You forgot your turn.
Sugar: the language of all species.
Okay, only some species.
i love how he made sure their tongues didn‚Äôt touch the can, we love a hygienic king
Omg. This is like my house. You have to share anything you eat.

I seem to remember buying Cheeze Whiz in a can one time and teaching everyone how to wheeze the cheeze.
Are you sure you're not a Disney princess?
I'm going to try that on one of my cats
It's so bad for the animals but, so good for my soul.
I think a cat should be allowed to have a little whipped creme
Requesting invite to gang.
Me next!
We buy whipped cream in multiples for this exact purpose.
Pretty funny post with them cute pups and kitty
That gave me Christmas vibes but then I remembered that Christmas is over
Is that safe for them to eat?

Yo man I heard you got some of that sweet stuff
Animals on the kitchen counter........gross
Farts and possible diarrhea in our house if we did that! The cat would def barf it up too.
Oh yay! Sugar for the dogs! Perfect idea!
did u just mention cream? is that a jojo reference?
Everyone here shitting on giving whipped cream to pets but I‚Äôm the elitist saying you should make your own whipped cream... powdered sugar and heavy whipping cream, and beat it with a whisk or mixer. So so so much better than that canned shit
The way the cat gets a smaller bit cos their smol... PRECIOUS!
Thought it was going to be some kind of Always Sunny gif.
Are you kidding me? My dog is terrified of the whipped cream bottle and the noise it makes. I have to squirt it on my finger and even then he might not want it smh
Weirdest episode of It's Always Sunny I've ever seen
The one of their tongues touches it, so you decide to establish it as ‚Äúthe dog can‚Äù.  

Then you need some ‚Äúnot-dogified whipped cream‚Äù, so you buy another.  

And pretty soon it becomes a thing; you keep two cans in the fridge, one labeled ‚ÄúD‚Äù and one labeled ‚Äúme‚Äù...

You become a servant to the gang.  I know cause I am one.  Spoiled brats.
That is disgusting
What episode of Always Sunny is this?

The last dog you fed, the little black and white one, what type of breed are they? I have a very similar looking dog and was told he is a terrier, but that's about it.
On behalf of all the germaphobes, I would like to thank you for not letting the animals touch the tip of the whipped cream nozzle.

Form the look of it, it seems like the taxe for every time someone uses the whipped cream

Make sure they don‚Äôt get diabetes, would have to test there blood 2x a day, inject insulin 1x a day, and weigh there food, and in this case, watch all animals eat and make sure none of them get 1 pebble of dog food more than they should
If you really loved your animals you would not give them that stuff.  No, not even in moderation.
I was waiting for Always Sunny music.
Do that at my house and you'll lose a finger, my wife is a fiend for that stuff ;)

If my cat smells the faintest scent of ice cream or hears one clink of my spoon on the bowl she comes running.

Sugar is so bad for dogs. Don't know about cats but don't give your dogs whipped cream.
Also no ice cream
Is that healthy for them ?
Adorable video, but too much whip on those drinks...gonna make them cold!

One of my cats, our most beautiful idiot, will steal broccoli right out of your hand. Carrots he‚Äôs ok with, green beans are always a thrill, edamame husks are the ultimate snack. He can‚Äôt have edamame husks though; he accidentally got into some once and when he pooped them out. Dear god. The mess.
Is it not healthy for cats?
I immediately thought this was a Sunny In Philidelphia clip.
You have a house full of adorable animals!
If you really want to give your dogs a treat, raw goat milk. It‚Äôs easy for them to digest, it‚Äôs actually good for them and they go nuts for it.
Even the cat shows up! This is wholesome.

I know this will get downvotes,but i just want to ask you somthing. Is there suger in that wiped cream or is it for animals? Pls dont feed them suger. They can die. Its not safe for them to eat it. Just a little bit probably wont do anything, just a tummy ache, but please dont do this too often. I recommend not to do it at all, because animals can die from sugar.
whipped cream has twice the amount of sugar compared to regular coke. this is not ok and the way these pets line up it does look like a regular thing. 

oh and it might look like good behavior the way they line up but it is not. they are begging for it

This would be so much better with sound.

Just don‚Äôt give them too much, it can give them diabetes

Like opening cheese at our house.
What a good pet parent! Kudos to you!
Glad that the title has the word 'whipped' in it.

I hope the gang also gets dental care
Gotta pour one out for the homies! Except they‚Äôre alive. And animals. And it‚Äôs whipped cream.
Oh my gosh my dog does the same. But he comes running when he hears me pick up the can
Nothing for the human?
Aww the cats like a dog and the little dogs Omg! Cute overload!
Why is this ok but when I tell people I give my pets cream pies they insult me and walk off???
Those are all some weird looking pigs.
Of course the derpy yorkie drops it on the floor. 

They‚Äôre the best. The derps have sucked me in, im a lifelong yorkie mom.
And instant diarrhea
Why did i read this as "The gang gets whipped hard"
Definitely going to see if my cat will try it today.
Is it just me or are those goldens pretty big? Not fat but tall and and large.

My wife has a gaggle of cats climbing the cabinets when she does her coffee.
I have the exact same situation in my house. They hear the can and all 5 of them, 2 dogs and 3 cats, come running.
The animals are adorable, but I‚Äôm in love with that kitchen!
Why is my heart melting
My cat i had in college loved Twizzlers and marshmallows. I literally had to keep them in my bedroom because he could open the cabinet doors and drawers and withhold chew through the packaging to get to them.
Someone likes cleaning diarrhea I see.
I see a product bringing joy to these pets that caused animals that you don't see here a lot of pain.

That is if it's dairy and not plant-based.

They are too cute. I‚Äôve conditioned my dog to come whenever she hears the whipped cream too! She loves it
I wish I could have a house full of dogs again so bad. Moments like these make me miss living with a bunch of animals, even if they‚Äôre crowding/begging/clingy; sharing in groups with the fuckers always makes you feel warm and fuzzy
Aww all of them got creampied...
That title made me think I was in r/peoplefuckingdying for a moment.

But.. but... you missed out yourself!!
Awww sweet! We do this too! Our Brittany Spaniel doesnt like the noise it makes but loves the whip cream and our Chocolate Lab would eat the can and all if he could lol.
This is me in the future
Oh, this brings back memories of my Maggie Mae!  She loved sweets, and whipped cream was one of her favorite things.  She's sit and wait, and her mouth would make a perfect O waiting for her squirt. Your babies are so good and polite waiting for their turns.

How many Animals have you got? Have you got more than these 5?
Whipcream 2: Electric Sugarshitaloo
Aww! It‚Äôs so cute to see how each one reacts differently to it.
The cat made me lol üòÇ
You get whipped cream! And you get whipped cream! Everybody gets whipped cream!
In addition to the cream, cats can have a little salami.
Nasty
Thought this was going to be "it's always sunny" reference
I love how he changes the delicacy of how he dispenses the whipped cream for each individual animal.
This owner is whipped.
there's always one asshole that has to put his mouth on it
You have a lot of pets. Does it have something to do with a job?
Excuse me while I whip this out.
This is a prime example why I don‚Äôt participate in potlucks
That‚Äôs awesome üëç
Thats fucking beautiful
What a sweet collection of animals.   :)
But i hope theres not a lot of sugar in the whipped cream
After I read the title, I heard Temptation Sensation start playing in my head.
So now you're washing that right
Cats and dogs alike sure love it.

I don't blame them.
That's not whipped cream. It's squirty cream.
My dog's name is Chantilly (Whipped Cream in Portuguese) hahaha ü•∞
Each by each animal came up and so did my smile
Lots of doggo but why only 1 cat?

The gang gets diarrhea!

Seems like that wasn't the first time. They knew what was coming!
I love how they took the size into consideration. Big boys get bigger creams but the same amount could make the small boys sick.
How the heck is your house so clean with all those guys! Mine is a damn wreck and I feel like all I do is clean.. after the animals! üòÇ
