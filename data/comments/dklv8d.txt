I think Jackman is just as excited as his fan, they both seem to be having the time of their lives.
I bet Hugh Jackman made a fantastic P.E. teacher.
‚ÄúAlways give the fans their moment. You might never remember it, but they will never forget it‚Äù

Ronnie James Dio
This is so nice
This was honestly the most wholesome thing I have seen in a long while
Hugh Jackman, what a fucking awesome dude!!
When I was a butcher/store manager in a fancy grocery store in NYC back in the late 2000s, Hugh Jackman came in one morning with one of his kids. He was by far the nicest person, not just celebrity, who‚Äôd every shopped in our store. Gracious and kind to everyone. His kid was super nice and well behaved too, which to me says a lot. 

Might sound like a creeper, but he also had the most muscular butt I‚Äôve seen on a human. He looks like a super hero
Hugh is the greatest!  r/HughBeingAwesome
r/HumanTippyTaps
The thing i like about this is that the feeling you get is very personal and even trying to explain it and even if someone says they understand, they really don't. The won't know the magic because of how much more of a fan perhaps you were and how you were the only one in the world to experience such a moment. It's a strong moment for sure !
What's the context for this? :P whats happening in this video?
If  Hugh Jackman and Keanu Reeves stood side by side, their combined positivity could stop planets, in their tracks.
*Appropriately excited fan finally meets Hugh Jackman and reacts appropriately
Where is that guy‚Äòs video? Wanna watch it^^
Could you imagine the heart break if the phone wasnt recording
I love Hugh. After this Ryan Reynolds sung him happy birthday I think
Made that guy's YEAR!  So nice <3
I love Hugh, he's one of my biggest role models. I'd love to meet him in person one day
I honestly think Hugh Jackman should get the same praise Bob Ross and Keanu Reeves gets. He‚Äôs such a cool, humble dude!
Am I the only one that thought for a second Hugh was about to accidentally take this guys phone when he stood up with it.
Legit didn't notice until the end that he was wearing a Wolverine tee and was wondering if Hugh does Wolverine poses at every show...
Imagine being so selflessly self aware that you know you could make someone‚Äôs day by just acknowledging them and still actually taking the time to do it.
Would you want to interact with your fans? 

Celebrity actor: No. 

Hugh Jackman: It‚Äôs fun. that‚Äôs why. 

Ryan Reynolds: Of course I would. I would even take them out to dinner. Maybe some head even. Actually, what did Hugh say? He said what? He‚Äôs lying to you. Don‚Äôt ever believe what he says, believe what I say. Always believe what I say.
HughManBeingBro
made me smile so wide
That's one awesome Huge Ackman
Saw this show (Hugh Jackman‚Äôs show, but not this specific performance), and there were similar moments to this in that show as well. Hugh Jackman‚Äôs a real quality guy. Really gets on well with his fans it seems.
Ok wheres the cell video.
Wholesome Hugh
I could never be this excited to see another human being
I need to see the phone footage
We don't deserve Hugh Jackman
r/hughbeingawesome

Dude's a legend. I hope I meet him someday.
On 10/6/19 HJ performed in Newark, NJ.  He did the audience thing and [found a guy with 3 empty tall boy beer cans under his seat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqotTcPFVQg).  One of the highlights of the show.

Jackman did a bit about learning to tap dance and started off [tap dancing to AC/DCs Thunderstruck](https://youtu.be/hOs88BWkkKI?t=114).  A good show overall...
Can we get his POV?
This spring i took my girlfriend to his show because she really adored "the greatest showman". I didnt really care for the movie or the show before hand but I loved his show and for the most part because hugh loved ut on stage, and really enjoys interacting with the crowd in the most genuinly nice wat Ive ever witnessed. Now this guy is my biggest mancrush!
This dude is like the opposite of Perry Cox.
I‚Äôm willing to bet that it was Ryan Reynolds as the fan... prove me wrong
 I love when people get unapologetically excited over things/people they love!
The Hugh Jackman tour is definitely an entertaining night.  Highly recommend buying tickets.
I'm not sure why my comment was so downvoted. :( . This video was so sweet it made me ugly cry and people thought that was downvote worthy? I wanted it clarified that it's so sweet that he made his whole experience like that and i have a few if i ever get to meet i hope would do the same.
Huge is Australian Keanu
I'd probably act the same way.. he's awesome.
Hugh will be on the same page as Keanu on Reddit
Expect high five, get hug instead
Well didnt expect to well up in 10 seconds.. :/
I want to see the video on the other end now!
I think hugh jackman is slowly climbing the ladder of internet stardom that keanu reeves is currently on top of. Dont know if he‚Äôll dethrone keanu, but i like him :)
That brings a smile on my face
This made my whole week.
Bro I‚Äôm really bout to cry this is so good
you're on the way to number 1 Reddit post of the week. Congratulations, man.
That guy will remember that interaction for the rest of his life and I can't help but smile.
Damn! High fives, video, and a hug! 

That‚Äôs like the best thing ever
This isn't cringe, it is just genuine shared excitement.
This guy is living out my life dream, nbd. So thrilled for him.
Overexcited Hugh Jackman finally meets fan and can‚Äôt control himself.
Ok I was team Deadpool but I may have just switched sides.
His wife was like.... seriously I wanted to say hi as well
Damn, that just feels so authentic
Hugh jackman plays drums?
Now that, that is wholesome
Which one is the out of control, overly excited fan? 
Jackman is PSYCHED.
What an awesome guy (both of them!)
that fan will remember this moment for the rest of his life. Kinda envy him.
I fucking love Hugh Jackman. When Hugh grabs the guys phone to film him back! üòÇ
That's so great!!  Made me smile !    I am happy for the guy.  üòÅ
and I'm over here smilin like an idiot-
What a fucking bro
I‚Äôm going to give you the highest honor I can bestow to you op 

*updoot*

*save*
I do this to my daughter. When I‚Äôm really irritated or frustrated I just pretend like I got a burst of energy and I run around and act crazy playing with her. She gets a kick out of it, unaware that I‚Äôm irritated and I get to release some frustration.
Hugh Jackman is so awesome!
It makes me so happy when people talk about Hugh Jackman because I know it‚Äôs always about him being amazing :‚Äô)
Holy shit, this is the best thing I've seen in a long time
Haha! My girlfriend and I were there for this! It was in KCMO!

Hugh also brought a dad up on stage to have the dad show off his dance moves... Which he did, but later confessed that his 5 year old daughter just had brain surgery in Houston and it was her dream to see Hugh in concert. Hugh gave him the biggest hug and it was very heart warming. Also the dad's daughter is now seizure free!

I applaud celebraties that, for all accounts that I can tell, are real genuine human beings and I think Hugh is one of those. He also has a great voice...
*overexcited Hugh Jackman meets fan and can't control himself

FTFY
Hugh is one of few celebrities that refuses to put himself above his fans. He is the best!
What a bromance!
i want to see the clip from this phone
I was actually right next to this and was hilarious.  Hugh Jackman was probably the best entertainer I have ever seen and is probably the most genuine celebrity I have ever seen as well.


[Picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/8Pwv48f)
I was standing in the same aisle as this fan. Hugh Jackman was so nice to him the whole concert! Hugh Jackman is an amazing person.
r/BrosBehavingLike12YearOldGirls
126k upvotes just shows how amazing this really is
Holy shit this is so cute, and I'm excited that they're excited! I'd have started jumping along with the guy just because I'd been so hyped for them.
The definition of bromance right there.
I‚Äôd be acting the same way if not worse. Love Hugh
This is how I wish more celebs acted with their fans every now and then... What a stand-up guy. He did the wolverine claws and everything! God bless em both.
He's a huge act, man.
Finally some wholesome freak out
Why is high Jackman just such a badass guy. What a stand up guy.
I'm just thinking how Ryan Reynolds will probably do a big Meetup with fans just to annoy Hugh but Hugh will up him and it goes on for so long that they have met every single one of their fans
Oh man why is Hugh so good?? We dont deserve this dude! He‚Äôs awesome üòé
This post is more wholesome than the entire r/wholesomememes sub tbh
he would be a badass uncle
this is actually scary. How can you worship someone so much so you literally start crying when you see them. Its just an actor
I mean, come on, is there any other reaction possible than this when meeting the wolverine?!?
That phone is probably worth millions
Hugh gotta love this!
This memory will stay with this guy for the rest of his life. How lovely x
Move the 'and' in front of Hugh Jackman.
Like how the hell can you not like hugh Jackman. This guy got some charisma
Oh my god, such contagious happiness
This made that guys life, freaking awesome.
What is HH a drummer or something? I know he‚Äôs an actor but never seen him with drumsticks
I bet this is one of the best memories in that guy's life. :D
Well, to me, Hugh seems more excited...
I fucking love how they hyped each other up.
This just put a smile on my face I can't get rid of and now my family is asking why I'm smiling for no reason
Can literally feel the energy even with the sound off
that is pure joy if I've ever seen it
That is awesome
Yo I can relate, fucking A
I expected Hugh just walk off with the phone
This does put a smile on my face...
Further proof that Hugh is the man.
\[Everyone liked that.\]
I love the role Wolverine plays as Hugh Jackman irl.
:)
Hugh jackman is probably one of the nicest celebrities
Hugh Jackman is a national treasure
Seriously, Hugh is the best. So wholesome.
I would love to see that recording on that guys phone.
Huge Jackman is for the people
Jackman is such a good dude
Love him and his kindness. Yay to my fellow Aussie.
Now that‚Äôs pretty cool on how someone like Hugh Jackman interacts with his fans. That is pretty fucking kick ass.
That is great! He'll never forget this.
Damn dude looks like wolverine when he did that move even without the hair costume or blades on his hands. Crazy how much he added to the character of wolverine with just the body language.
r/WolverinesBeingBros
Every time someone says Hugh Jackman i instantly think "huge ack man"
Hugh is an awesome human!
Watched this without knowing which sub it belonged to and literally ‚ÄúAww‚Äù-ed out loud. Great post. Thank you for sharing üòäüëç
Really giving the people what they want with the Wolverine pose.
That is the best thing I've seen whole day
This was the most lovingly aggressive bromance I've ever seen
I'd say that's the exactly right amount of excitement for something like that
[deleted]
Now this is just so goddamn sweet. Bless the hell outta both of their hearts.
I would probably have the same reaction.
The guy goes full dolphin when he jumped
I love when humans do the thing where they jump up and down in excitement!
I hope I don‚Äôt hear any negative stuff about Mr Jackman . He seems like such a cool dude
...i‚Äôd probably do the same
Looks also like overexcited High Jackman finally meets fan and cant control himself.
Absolute fucking legend
Hugh, hugging a huge hugh fan
So much broness going on.
I wonder what it feels like to have a stranger react to you like that.  It seems so weird to me
Hugh is still ripped years after playing wolverine. I'm proud of him
This actually made me cry tears of joy
It's a small world when you're a big man.

You know one more super-fan showed up in this video but Hugh told him to fuck off, it broke my heart. :'(
god this made me so happy to just see, i love it when famous people really appreciate their fans and give them the love they deserve
Overexcited Hugh meets fan.
r/HughBeingAwesome
This made me smile from ear to ear. :)
That guy really loves Huge Jacked Man.
I really hope it was actually recording.
Hugh Jackmen is such an incredible guy. That would make my life! So sweet. Back up your phone, bro.
How exciting must it be to know someone is that excited to see you
Hugo  Hackman is one of the coolest. But why the fuck do people care about celebrities this much? I‚Äôll never understand it.
Now we need the video on the phone.
Parasocial relationships are weird and destructive but i hope this guy treasures this moment :) even if Hugh sees this every day it's important to the guy, regardless of what it means to the celeb this kinda stuff is still wholesome
Goddamn if this isn't one of the most wholesome moments I've ever seen
It must be so nice to have the power to make someone so happy with such a seemingly small gesture.
So what show is this that he did? I saw the happy birthday hugh vid but i don't understand the setting?
Then Hugh Jackman just walks off with his phone into the distance, to never be seen again...
Is it the fan that can‚Äôt control himself or is it Hugh?
Hugh Hackman‚Äôs a national treasure.
Wait... Jackman plays the drums?
I noticed the guy wore a cool wolverine shirt too, definitively a supportive fan
It's so nice for Hugh to take the time to make Ryan Reynolds' week.
r/hughbeingawesome
r/hughbeingawesome
Oh my gosh I LOVE THIS!!!
This is one of those rare occurrences that are just so wholesome that my ear to ear smile turns into a full on giggle that almost makes my heart skip a beat. This is medicine for any rainy day, and I'm sure I'll still be feeling pretty great about life by the end of the night.
Thats just fucking awesome.
I‚Äôve worked with Hugh a few times. It drives him crazy when I ignore him.
Hugh jackman is cool. I remember the time when he was on Broadway a long time ago and a member of the audience‚Äôs phone goes off and his response to it was great (he didn‚Äôt humiliate the person).


https://youtu.be/Z7PCW5hi9Wc
High Jackman is one of the most genuine and friendly celebrities I know
Totally expected that to be Ryan Reynolds for a min.
*Forgets to hit record*
This is so wholesome what the fuckkk  (>u<    )
Hugh Jackman is just a good dude!
What a huge jackman
I'm happy for him
This video makes me so happy
This whole thing is delightful.
Hugh Jackman is the reason I was suspended in 4th Grade for putting pencils between my fingers to mimic him and stabbing the bully from 6th Grade. Good times
I think we should have something like r/yourbreathtaking for everytime a celebrity makes the spectators feel special.
Is hugh jackman in a band?
What a good dude.
FIFY - Overexcited Hugh Jackman meets fan and can‚Äôt control himself.
I saw his concert in Boston. He does this.
Is hugh....in a band?
Honestly, who wouldn't react this way to Hugh Jackman?

He's pretty great.
Need to find the guy's video
Hugh Jackman seems to enjoy being Hugh Jackman, and likes to share that joy with everyone else.
Bro you're 30, calm down
Can we get that guy to post the video that‚Äôs on his phone?
This is so cute

Hugh Jackman's show was so much fun! I was sitting up in the nosebleeds in Denver but I SWEAR he pointed right at me and said "I see you up there!" What a cool dude
*forgets to press record on phone*
Dude he did the wolverine pose at him! AHHHHHHHH
I honestly couldn‚Äôt imagine getting this excited to meet anyone. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm dead inside though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I want to meet hugh jackman.
Hugh Jackman, Keanu Reeves, Tom Hanks...

Celebrities we don‚Äôt deserve...
Watching this without sound looked like he was yelling at that kid lmao
I will never be as cool as Hugh Jackman but the fact that humanity can produce a being as cool as Hugh Jackman gives me hope for the future. ADAMANTIUM RAGE!!!
He seems like a really cool dude. One of the few stars I would actually like to meet.
Aww, this is so wholesome :)
[deleted]
Someone give Hugh Jackman a gold!!
I love when celebrities act like nice normal human beings and not like upper class arrogant people
Huge Jackman
Hugh Jackman is such a treat of a human
When people look up to people and those people turn out to be good people to look up to. Isn‚Äôt that great.
Man I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a single person in the world I‚Äôd be that excited to see.
I saw him live in Columbus,  Oh, and he brought a guy on stage and embraced him for like a solid minute. 

... then hit on him profusely while he was in character as Peter Allen.
Breathtaking
r/humansbeingbros
Definately the greatest of showmen
Wholsome Hugh
I work at one of the studios he rehearsed his tour at and he was always so nice to us. Made a point to say hello and ask how we were. When he left for the tour he bought us all cupcakes. He‚Äôs a damn good dude
This show is fucking amazing
Umm, are we not gonna mention the human tower in the background?
Hugh is a god
I wanna be hugged by Hugh Jackman :(
That whole show was like that. Best part was the love he gave for that little girl that went brain surgery the week prior, and her wish after recovery was to meet Hugh Jackman. 

Dude is a born performer
Some people out there living their best life... and i am living with netflix, food, and sleep.
Rob Gronkowski is always living his best life every minute of every day!
My uncle used to be his neighbour when he moved back to Aus bc his mum was sick. 

Can confirm. Hugh is like this all the time.

Once on snap maps there was just videos of him singing in Woolies (supermarket) as he did his shopping. A gem.
#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/gmcl86!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
So freaking wholesome
Hugh Jackman is a class act and boss.
Does anyone have a link to the video the fan took?
Love the vid, but I cant actually hear what Hugh‚Äôs saying. Would anybody translate for me?
Fantastic, they say he's a great guy. 
I love it when Guys like him just jump at the chance.
I am on the internet. I AM ONLINE!!!!
Imagine the phone not recording
Why's he holding drumsticks? Is he a drummer too??
Quality human.
His daughter goes to my high school. She has a really cool dad.
Hugh can't control himself
What a good dude ..knows he's no better then anyone else and acts it ...that's a real star right there
Some humans being bros stuff right here. You can‚Äôt help but feel good seeing how happy that guy is.
Hugh just got a huge hug from my friend Hue.
I hope he pressed the rec button
What a great way to greet a rabid fan! I do hope it is on his camera, that Jackman hit the right button.
I can't say I'd be any cooler. 

He'll always be Wolverine to me.

Now, can we get an R Rated Wolverine with R.R.'s Deadpool and Keanu as Gambit? Please?
Now that‚Äôs a celebrity I can be proud of.
When a legend meets another legend.
Look it‚Äôs huge yackman
It actually made me smile 

feels good
I love that girl

"I must touch him"
It must be nice to have people like you. I'm sure it can get annoying and intrusive at times. But almost no one likes me so when I think about what if just meeting me made someone so happy I get the warm fuzzies.
It‚Äôs the purge my dude, mods day off
Would have been funny to see him walk away with the phone.
What a superstar. Happiness is contagious.
That is awesome
Imagine meeting your childhood star and only viewing him through the screen of your camera.

Seems like a waste of you're just going there to record him and watch it play back to you when you get home.
This is so wholesome.
This is the definition of wholesome.
Definitely one of my favorites
I like how halfway through the guy thinks Hugh is about to give him another high-five, but he hugs him instead
Commenting to save
I have that same exact phone case. He is using a LG K30 lol
did that guy ever post the video?
This made me cry. It's so wholesome. ‚ù§
awwwww that is so wholesome
Aww meets cringe.
This is amazing. I am so disappointed that I will never be that excited to see a celebrity in public, because it looks really enjoyable.
Jackman‚Äôs beard is going to get jealous!
That fantastic.
Overexcitement, what do u mean..This is the right level of excitement when u meet Hugh Jackman...
Hugh wants to fuck him.
I saw Hugh Jackman a couple weeks ago in Long Island. He saw this one kid doing fortnite dances and tried his best to keep up and then picked him and his sister up for a family photo. He really is a treasure
[deleted]
[deleted]
If you have anything negative to say about this you literally have no soul. This is amazing. Hugh Jackman is amazing. Long live Wolverine.
Imagine what he would've felt like if the camera wasn't rolling
"**Overexcited fan finally meets Hugh Jackman and can‚Äôt control himself.** "  
Which one?
The drummer in me needs to know why he's holding drumsticks
Does anyone else think it's kinda weird to get that excited over "meeting" a person. There's a lot of artists that I really love but I can't imagine myself acting like that if I met them.
That is just too freaking wholesome.
I was never really a fan of superheros, comics or movies. Woverine was a huge exception. That part was just made for him.
Hugh Jackson is actually a human gift ü•∫ he's just so good
I didn't know Jackman was a drummer. He must really üòé shred it!
omg so wholesome
High just seems like such a genuinely great guy.
What was this?
Hugh! You son of a *bitch!*
Hugh Jackman is awesome. He always comes across as a super nice guy in interviews and public appearances.
If he forgot to hit record...
r/mademesmile would also like this
imagine he didn't press the record button.
I love Hugh. He seems like such a genuine person. This whole interaction just made my day.
Ryan Reynolds is so jealous right now...
I want to see the view from the phone
I want to see the video from the dude.
r/mademesmile
Should i award
Haha cool, looks like the Hugh Jackman The Show tour - I just went to it last week on the 15th! Was pretty cool, :)
This is, like, the most wholesome bro move I've ever seen!
wouldve been much better if he stole the phone
Thought he wanted to steal the smartphone. Get your own, Hugh!
Is that Ryan Reynolds in disguise?
Bruhhhhh
that's actually wholesome
Hugh then pockets the phone and leaves.
He seems like a genuinely good guy, and from more than just this video üòä
Aren't we all gay for Hugh Jackman (c)
He's pure awesome, I want to be half as awesome as he is when I'm 50.
Awww  so nice!!
I wish I could see the video from that guy‚Äôs phone too!
My mom and sis went to one of his concerts a week or so ago. They both said he was awesome. 

I'm inclined to agree
He's not done with Wolverine.
Waiting to see the fans video posted here.
So sweet
Nailed every single high five I would‚Äôve fucked at least one up
Went to his show back in June, and it was fantastic! Hugh Jackman is a treasure to this world.
Hugh Jackman is in a band?
r/ThatsMyFuckingHero
Thats a pewdiepie right there.... Noice.
Hugh Jackman is one of the nicest, most genuine celebrity I know...I like him almost as much as I like Tom Hanks!
if I could choose to be any celebrity i would probably pick him.
Hugh Jackman and Keanu Reeves really need to do a movie together.
awwww hahaha this is so sweet
Met him once... incredibly humble, the nicest  down to earth man!
I wanna see Hugh Jackman front a metal band now. I dont know why but I think itd be awesome
R/MadeMeSmile
Somebody pleeeeease link the video they made!
This is pretty cool, and classic Hugh.

But is no-one else even a little annoyed about how many times he changes the filming orientation on that phone?!
Aww, it cut off right before we see if the fan ever gets his phone back. üòî
Love Hugh Jackman!!!
Can confirm that HJ is the man. Worked crew on a film  of his and he made a point to say hello to everyone everyday (and would always apologize when he couldn't remember my name) and handed out scratch cards every Friday. He would even circle back and ask crew if they had gotten a scratch card a second time to just be sure everyone got one. A genuine human being and a pleasure to work with.
This does bring a smile to my face
I really wanna see the video from the kids phone
Is that the Wolverine?
[YES! YES! YES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJbmB9k2Y88)
What a fucking good guy.
Thats so cool
Love this
Hugh is such a genuine guy.
Was hoping for Ryan Reynolds
Hugh Jackman is a legend!
Isn't this from that John travolta movie
"Ok nice, I'm gonna keep your phone now mate"
Is this sub just wholesome memes but good?
*appropriately excited
I feel the same way about my wife
Gronk seeing Brady and Edelman for the first time in three days
Guess you could say he was a huge Jackman fan...
I kept whispering...‚ÄùNow walk away with his phone, do it Hugh, no one will say anything, you‚Äôre Hugh Fucking Jackman.‚Äù
Damn.. In all seriousness, imagine being such a big deal that you have people literally losing their shit like this just to see you.
I fucking love this guy
When the fan goes ham, go ham with them
I'd like to think this is how I'd be as a celebrity, just constantly playing and in gratitude mode.
The kind of energy we need in this world
He is such a dad I love him
One of the many reason why I love Hugh Jackman
Jackman plays drums?
Later he found out that he forgot to press record.
This is nice but the dudes an abusive, alcoholic jerk to his band mates. I know people who have toured with him and it isn't pretty at all. Sorry to be a downer but he's screwed good friends of mine who didn't deserve it
That‚Äôs amazing.
That's so wonderful
Hugh Hackman seems to be so sweet. I gosh darn love that man.
I want to marry that man
I‚Äôm in love with the fact that the fan was goin in for a high five but got a hug instead
I wonder if he's posted the video from his fun, that would be something to watch!
What was High doing? Why is he holding drum sticks?
Coworker went on some week long yoga retreat and he was there. She said he was awesome, hung out with everyone the entire time.
Huh
r/humantippytaps
This is so wholesome
Too bad it wasn't recording.
His show, Jackman‚Äôs, was fantastic! I don‚Äôt blame this guy one bit!
This is awesome, I love the "Wolverine Flex" hahahha
lol that was great.
For a moment I thought maybe the fan was gonna come on stage, pick up Hugh who'd wrap his legs around the fan's waist, then the fan would batista bomb Jackman off the stage
Me meeting Peter Capaldi or Jenna Coleman
This is so wholesome
this is lovely
Its more like damn im so glad he is awesome in real life and not a complete asshole like most famous people
Good thing he didn't broke that phone haha üòÇ
I love celebs that love their fans
The broest of bros.
I went to a brad paisley concert and he actually did an entire song with a young girls phone and gave it back to her. Love people who enjoy their fans
looks like Hugh got over-excited too.
When you and the homie take that first key.
Hugh Jackman is all manüòåü•∞
This of course reminds me of the episode of The Life and Times of Tim where Hugh Jackman moves into the building. Tim and the Mattress King hate him, even though he‚Äôs like the nicest guy in the entire world lol.
I love how he goes for a high five but Hugh just hugs him instead
Ngl thought he was gonna thrown the phone
Do they have a source for that phone's footage??
You've waited one and a half hours for that moment!

His inner fanboi: WORTH IT! WORTH IT! WORTH IT! WORTH IT!
That man is a treasure
This made me smile at work, I love it!
He‚Äôs the man, fucking rad.
That reaction was entirely fucking appropriate.
Dr. Cox was wrong about Hugh Jackman, don't @ me!
I love how he never gave him back his phone
Never meet your heroes def does NOT apply to HJ.
Startet with a Southpark reference ended in some weird shit
I can't say I'm a big Hugh Jackman fan but this makes him seem like a totally awesome dude
This legitimately made my day better and put a genuine smile on my face
This fan acts how I would internally feel if I met High Jackman. 

He makes my ovaries shiver.
Pure
Don‚Äôt even care much for Hugh Jackman but if he reacted like that to me recording him I would get jacked as well.

Getting Jacked by a Jackman!
‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE BREATHTAKING!!‚Äù
Title unclear, can't tell whether the fan or Hugh can't control themselves.
We don‚Äôt deserve Hugh.
I like that most of this generation of actors are more open to interacting with fans. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just been exaggerated but it seemed like back in the day old Hollywood celebrities wanted a concrete wall between them and the people at all times.
be great if he kept the dude's phone
I love Hugh but damn.
Very cool!
What genuine guy. I love it
Hugh Jackman is like a jacked Tom Hanks that can also sing and dance.
It's impossible to not love this guy.
I wonder if Hugh Jackman knows the joy he has brought to people just passing by this video haha
r/publicfreakout
This is literally my dream
That would be me!
Imagine being locked in a room with Keanu Reeves, Hugh Jackman and Tom Hanks who would you hug first????
I wish he would put his phone down when meeting his idol :/
#bestdayever
This is the best fan interaction I‚Äôve seen with anybody
 This is so pure
Man there are certain little boy moments that men have as adults that are SO fucking cute.
More proof Hugh Jackman is one of the greatest humans on this earth.
Where is the video from the fans phone? That should be the viral one!!
Rad
Now we just need to see the video on that phone.... Come on people of reddit! We can do it!
I love that they both lack chill, this must have been awesome
Nice treatment of a fan. Class act.
Imagine if he started swiping left through his files. Instant anxiety.
I hope this dude posts the video from that phone.
Looks like thay are really good friend and haven't seen each other for a long time!
Was Hugh Jackman playing drums at a concert? If so that's awesome!
Plot twist he is his son
Is the title referring to Hugh or the fan?
If aliens landed and asked to speak to a representative of humanity, I think Hugh Jackson would be our best choice as a species.
Could he *be* any cooler‚ÄΩ
The human equivalent of how excited my dog gets when i come home. Wholesome af!
Me if I met Robert Downey jr.
This is awesome
What if he got his phone back and it wasn't recording
My boyfriend and I went to this show and it was great! Highly recommend! He is a great performer and was so nice to everyone in the audience!
I wish he put the drumsticks through his fingers like they were wolverine claws
Hugh is da Man!
*Fan with an appropriate amount of excitement
I‚Äôd have the exact same reaction. Except I‚Äôd be ugly crying.
class act
I want to see the view from his phone now
Man, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a video on the internet that make me dislike Hugh Jackman in any way.  The guy is a genuinely great human being.
I feel like if I was famous, I'd be more excited to see a fan than to they were to see me
Who is Hugh Jackman?
He had so many times not sure whether to hi-5, grab hand or hug lol. But I feel happy for him
I love Huge JackedMan
Now who's got a link to the cell phone video from the fan?
Wow, the veneration of an actor.
He‚Äôs such a class act one of his kids went to my school when he had time he would go with his kid to school and sign shit and just be a class act to everyone
I‚Äôm friggin jealous haha. But anxiety would just make me lock up.
You are breathtaking
This honestly made my day
awwe((:
even for just 1 fan, he went all out. respect
There are many people who are national treasures, but very few international treasures.

&#x200B;

Hugh Jackman is an international treasure.
When did Hugh Jackman start his own Tony Robbins type seminars?
Plot twist: he never got his phone back
This is amazing!
Good for him. Dudes nerding out hard and Hugh totally runs with it and makes his day.
But why does Jack have drum sticks
We don't deserve Hugh
Enough to make a grown man cry
What an amazing guy. Hugh is cool too
God bless Australia's own Hubert Jackman.
I was so ready for this to be Ryan Reynolds.
Maybe Dr Cox was wrong?
Awwww this is lovely, made me feel all warm and fuzzy.
**He nutted.**
Where was he playing drums?
Hugh is an incredible man
Hes so great.
Up there with Keanu Reeves as favorite actors
I have never liked anyone that much
He is 51? Wow Hugh looks a solid 10 years younger.
Fuck yea
That was fucking awesome! Even did the wolverine pose and everything. That man is in the same tier of cool with Keanu Reeves.
The feels
not gonna lie all the dog ones are amazing but i swear this one is the best ive seen so far
r/mademesmile would love this. What a wholesome moment
Hugh Jackman among others are in the running for nicest celebrity. I like this group of human celebrities instead of the stoic movie star of old.
*You're* breathtaking!
The fame and fortune I can live without and be alright, but I will always be jealous of a superstar's ability to completely rock someone's world and give a fan that "once in a lifetime moment" feeling. Sure, we can all be excellent to each other and that can brighten up someone's day, but no one is ever going to react to seeing me like this, lol.
Why is he holding drum sticks?
Honesty I love people like this. Just so happy and passionate about the things they like. A while ago there was this guy who recorded his reaction to a Star Wars trailer and was made fun of but it made me really happy to see him happy. The comments I read so far were all positive so I‚Äôm happy this guy isn‚Äôt being hated or picked on.
Huge Ackman
Hugh's a beautiful man. He used to be a customer of mine in my Sydney shop. He couldn't be a nicer person
I got excited one time and bounced like that. Everyone stared and I learned to never express excitement again
Can relate. Acted like a tweenage girl seeing her favorite boy band singer when I saw Russell Wilson up close at the game. Lost it. Am a 34yr old male...
Hugh is a good dude...
I wish people could put the phone away in this situation. It seems rude. The guy's a foot from your face and you stick a phone between
We need to find this guys phone video, it would be so selfish of him not to upload that for us to watch!
I wish I could get that excited over something
Hugh Jackman seems more ecstatic lool
r/Hughmansbeingbros
Hugh Jackman... from Australia
Chris Hemsworth... from Australia
Both super nice and happy people
Maybe I should move to Australia
Is there such a thing as r/wholesomecringe ?

Edit: there totally is
Anyone got the video he was making ?
He's such a cool dude
When the guy checks his photos and realizes Hugh ended the video when he grabbed his phone
How can I like this guy any more?!
He was filming for 1.5 hrs?  Well deserved
Damn. I wanna hug hugh jackman
Wholesome
When you ask your puppo if he wanna go out in that voice.
Hugh Hackman May be strong but inside he a little nice person
Twist: he didn‚Äôt give him his phone back.
Is there a different angle of this video?
Did anyone else see how the fan went in for a fancy handshake but was given a hug
Moment of a lifetime if you a fan of his! That‚Äôs awesome! Jumping for joy is awesome to see!
I want to watch his video
Man I just love Hugh Jackman.  Hes so multitalented and seems like such a good guy. Hes the total package!
This made me smile so much!!!
Hugh Jackman is hot af!
huge yakman is so nice
My mom actually had almost these exact seats about a week ago here in Chicago and got to shake his hand. She said he's just an unbelievably amazing performer.

Here's a great picture she took https://imgur.com/gallery/L7nthdz
We just went to his show in San Antonio! It was great!!!
Lmao that would be me too lol
["Murry, match his excitement"](https://youtu.be/OR-TRJ8ffGs)
Imagine if he spiked the phone aftetwards
The energys contagious. By the end I was pumped up
I wanna be this happy
He went from fan to mutant real quick üòÇüëåüèªüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I want to see that video
what a great guy
Hugh seems like such a cool guy. I've never heard a bad thing said about him.
He'll always be Jean Valjean from Les Miserables to me and this gif makes me feel extremely uncomfortable
How dare he? Hugh Jackman is Wolverine.
Get yourself someone that looks at you like this guy looks at him.
This makes me happy knowing that sum1 out there is that happy
Awww, what a Dad thing to do ‚ù§Ô∏è
u/vredditdownloader
This video made me cry, so wholesome
That was a Hugh Jactoff kindness
Wholesomest video
Wow what an incredibly wholesome moment. Hugh Jackman is one of the greats
I want to see the video from his phone!
Hugh Jackman seems like such a great guy. All the videos I've seem with him and the press, he is always unbelievably polite, and *genuinely* happy!
I'm definitely jealous, he got a hug from the frickin Wolverine.
Never thought I would geek out over seeing jackman to the Wolverine move.
That‚Äôs so adorable
Huge Jackman
Is the fan wearing booty shorts? because the screen in the back it sure looks like he is wearing booty shorts
I love this man so much. I fell in love with wolverine, then Hugh Jackman as just an amazing human being.
r/humantippytaps
I really hope that kid posts that video on Reddit. I'm dying to see it.
Come on Reddit,  where is the video from his phone?
Much manly
Thats awesome
r/humantippytaps
Ya know  I jus love Hugh Jackman
Pick your heroes, not everyone can be one. Deepen the meaning.
Hugh Jackman seems like he‚Äôs a real bro.
This is what life‚Äôs all about üòÅ
I'm looking forward to the video he took making the front page
Oh my god. I just want to squish him.
What a hughman!!!


ü§©
It can be so overwhelming when you meet your heroes. I met one of my favorite singers, and I started crying while talking to her at the autograph table. Hugh Jackman is such a great guy.
And that fan? Ryan Reynolds.

Well, no, probably not, but imagine if.
Anyone got a link to the fan's video?
r/thatsmyfuckinghero
Man that's epic. Wish I could do that with the members of Katastro...
That‚Äôs so wholesome
They say never meet your heroes... but in this case!
r/humantippytaps
What a guy
Was it Ryan Reynolds?
I gotta see the other phone's video
I think he was excited an appropriate amount lol
All that to come home and see he wasn't filming.
True fans are what we need. They motivate you genuinely
This is the feeling JD was trying to explain when he told Dr. Cox:  Hugh Jackman is Wolverine.
Dude I'd just sit down and cry! I've looked at him as my role model ever since I was in school and the first X-Men movie came out! I had a dream where I was in an elevator and he walks in and I just sure on the floor and start subbing like a child. Was too overwhelmed. Sure that's exactly what would happen if u meet him irl
Someone needs to link the video that was made on that phone!
Does he play the drums???
That's the video where Ryan Reynolds wishes him birthday.
The phone video is on his Instagram:  @taylor_van_engen
I think that's just the right amount of excitement for meeting Hugh Jackman
Lol wow
They'd make a cute couple.
Hugh is a legend such a lovely bloke
Anyone have the video from the phone?
Did he ever get his phone back?
Beautiful!
So weird.
Okay. Where is this guy's video?
thats so AWESOME i love how excited he is and i LOVE how excited Hugh is and how he just plays into it and loves it. You can tell he's like "wow dude, i really love how much of a fan you are of mine, this makes me feel SOOO good, thank you bro" and hugs him. I've always kinda known that Hugh was a sweet guy tho, he has to be.
This is fucking gold I would giv ean award but I'm broke
Hugh is a fucking beaut!
THEY BOTH WENT üñêüñê
Thats awesome
Made his day, and the day after, and the after, and... so on.
I felt that energy
Oh my god that's so wholesome, that's amazing
This made me cry bruh.
Where's the video from the phone? Come on, don't fail me now!
Why?
so wholesome i love it
Did he have an accident in his pants
Anyone got the dides phone view of this?
