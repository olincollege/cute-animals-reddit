Sometimes two or three mother cats will keep their kittens together and help each other take care of the kittens.  Including nursing each others kittens  This cat probably expects some help.
My wife and I had a cat who had a litter. Whenever we went from room to room mama kitty would bring her babies to be with us
"Can you babysit? I have a spa appointment. Thanks!"
Our cat had gone missing last week. When we called for it, she didn’t come. When we started panicking, our dog walked off our property and returned an hour later. Together with our cat. Animals are great.
Trust or Comfy Bed Take Over?!?!
My first cat was named Lily. I was gifted her as a kitten on my 4th birthday. She had one litter of kittens when I was 5 before she was spayed. When she was pregnant, we placed bets on when Lily would give birth; the prize being a special homemade treat of our choosing. 

I guessed Thursday. All of Thursday day went by and I was in bed around 7:30 pm (a bit disappointed, thinking I’d lost the bet). I awoke around 8:45-9 pm to the sounds of heavy breathing and felt damp. I lifted up my sheets and...there was Lily on my stomach in heavy labor! There were bits of blood and fluid on my nightie (shocking as fuck to me, I thought she was dying!). I screamed for my mom who ran up to discover the first of seven kittens under the sheets. 

My mom proceeded to maneuver me gently out of bed and kept Lily under my sheets while I softly pet her. After all seven healthy babies were born, we made up a nest beside my bed and washed the sheets/my nightgown. 

Whenever I have moments of doubt about my character or who I am in life, I instantly remember that moment. The fact my Lily girl was so comfortable and safe with me that she felt the best place to give birth was under the covers on my stomach..it makes my heart swell to this day. 

Oh, I also got créme brûlée for guessing the correct date! 

TLDR; my cat had kittens under the covers on my stomach when I was 5. It was the sweetest, most humbling thing that’s ever happened to me.
Experiencing this is one of the most amazing things in the world, because it shows such a high level of trust.
As a kid, I lived in a state with a really cold winter and had no window pane. My cat would hide her kittens under the covers with me. It was always a weird way to wake up. In retrospect, my parents should have bought a piece of glass and got our cat fixed.
Everything in the whole video is gorgeous! The beautiful cats, the room, the bedspread, those pajamas! Amazing!
Now they are yours, I am out of this. Going out to buy cigarettes. Will be back in 6 to 9 months.
"They're your problem now" - Momma cat
“Trust”

“Here! You babysit these stinkers for a while. I’m going frolicking then spend an hour in the litter box!”
Its like dropping the kids off at grandmas
I had a mama cat bring a sickly kitten to my doorstep once. We had lots of strays around because my MIL would feed them all. I watched about an hour or two to see if mama cat would come back for her and she never did. I think she knew that baby needed more support than she could give. 
We took her in and with some TLC she blossomed and was one of the best cats I’ve ever had.
To her* bed now.
One of my cats had her kittens in bed with me while I was asleep. On a white bedspread. I was in high school.(30+ years ago). Woke up about 2:30 am. Me, Mama cat, and one little tuxedo baby and one tabby. She had a box in the closet. I cleaned up and put her in the box. When I got up she added a little grey boy to the two girls.
Your cat has a beautiful face.
My momma cat screamed if I left her when she was giving birth on my bedroom floor.
I know this is a stupid question but I’ve always wondered.... how to cats bite/carry their babies like that and not puncture the skin/hurt them? 

They have super sharp teeth and It’s not like their retractable. Lol
Our cat delivered her kittens on my sons bed, while he was in it.  On his belly.  He was 7!   She was such a momma cat to him.
Big fan of that little duvet den for the kittens.
They're yours now. K thanks
My cat gave birth to her kittens, in my lap, in my bed at 1am. She had a birthing box but she was determined to stay with me. And yes I got rid of the sheet and everything and my blanket became her blanket.
Omg I’d die of happiness. They are so cute!
I was feeding a mama and litter of kittens a few blocks away from me living in a bush and a 2 weeks later I went to my backyard in the morning and I hear meowing from a bush- the mama and kittens are all in there. Idk how she did it and found my backyard but she did, so I let them stay in my garage after that until I got them adopted
"I trust you, I would like to offer my children.
“Look what I made, hooman!!” 💕
When I was 8, my cat had her kittens in one of my dresser drawers
-But maaaaa, I am sleeping

-Hush, we must make sure the big idiot keeps feeding us. Act cute.
Mother Cat: Here, look after these for a bit. Mommy needs a break.
r/SheBroughtHerKittens
Please neuter your pets people.
"Look, I birthed 'em, nursed 'em, and cleaned 'em. Since you're obviously not doing ANYTHING, watch 'em for a few minutes while I go get pregnant again"
Awww. Reminds me of when I was young and out cat had kittens. We set up a box in the living room and made her a nice safe cave with towels to keep her and the kittens comfy. 

Then in the middle of the night I wake up hearing this soft thud in the hallway. I get up to investigate and hear it again right next to me. I turn on the light and momma cat is trying her best to carry a kitten down the hall but keeps dropping it. I follow her to see where she’s going and she climbs into the open bottom drawer of my dresser and drops off the kitten with two others already there. Since she was struggling I follow her out to the box and grab the rest of the kittens and brought them back to my room & put them in the dresser drawer. Momma cat was so happy she chirped and laid down to sleep.
Maybe not trust. "These kids are on my last damn nerve. YOU watch them while i go to happy hour with the girls."
Probably the weirdest thing I ever woke up to was blood all over my bed and then I realized my cat decided to give birth in it while I was asleep. I appreciate the level of trust but the afterbirth was quite a chore to get out of the duvet.
Wish my cat was that nice
That cat owns that bed and everyone who sleeps on it
Love how she checks for enemy attack before hiding them under the covers
looks like a warm spot
r/animalsbeingbros
dawwwwwwwsssss!!!! look at dahhh bwabies!!!
"Look, look what I made!"
In my college days my cat got knocked up. I know irresponsible pet owner. I'm so happy I was able to experience the birth of kittens and witness momma's love for them. It is truly remarkable. And having 7 kittens running around is nothing but pure bliss!
Im pretty sure that mother cat was like, "ok its your turn to take care of them. Need a cat nap"
Sorry that isn't your bed anymore. That's a kitten fort.
My cat had her kittens in the bed between my husband and I.  Would have been fine to wake up to kittens, except we didn't know she was pregnant.  Scared the shit out of us!
A mother cat bringing her kitten to her human maid as a sign she is going out with the girls. 

There, I fixed the title.
My friend recently got kittens and the cat mom showed them to me. They are really cute :)
Kid suddenly starts jumping on the bed*
Hey human, baby sit my kids, will ya?
What breed is that? I gotta know!!!
My cat did that to me when her kits were two weeks old. She carried them one by one upstairs from her crate and placed them cArefully under the sheets at my feet.  When all were deposited she meowed to me and left the house for some r&r, i presume.  Guess I was babysitting.  I didn’t know cats did that.
T
“Watch my baby real quick”
“Please take them! I need a freaking break!!!”
My cat would never ever do this.
Best thing iv seen today!!
That’s her bed now
That night puking in your owners bed to wake them up
‘Watch my kids’
Such a good Mom, look at her
YOU babysit them...
Unless it's a sign of dominance. "This is my bed"
😍😍😍😍 soooooo cuuuuute!!!!
"Can you watch them for a bit. I have to go out to get a pack of cigarettes."
Awnnn, so cute. This is why cats are my favorite
I once gave a cat bed to a new mother and put her kittens in it because they were laying on dirt. The next day I went to check on them the kittens were gone and in the bed was a headless bird. That was a sign of distrust.
My heart ahhh ;n; <3
"Owners bed" lol. Thats the cats bed, ur just the live in servant.
I’ve always wondered: Does it hurt the kitten when the mother picks it up?
Here, it’s your turn with the kids now.
I need a nap.
Aww it’s bring in more little critters like rats and birds to feed to its owner ❤️
"Ok, ill be home at 8 make sure to give the milk to each and bed by 7. Oh, and watch out for smuffles, he liked to chew our old babysitters right thumb
So by 4pm did you leave the bed?
My heart, its melting!
This needs audio; anyone know the source?
That's the cutest f-cking thing I've ever seen in my life
Is there a sub for kittens/pups/animals being picked up by the back of their neck (scruffing)? It’s just the cutest thing ever
Ha! I like that the clip starts with the cat mid landing.
Be good to the babysitter. Mamma is off to party.
Hopefully teen mom has an appointment scheduled!
This might be the awwiest thing I’ve watched all day.
Best we ever got when my cat got pregnant was a bunch of half formed fetuses under furniture.
Actually! Humans don’t have cats as pets. Cats have humans as pets, and they run the house. Point proven above. Take it with a grain of salt though and your cat-master might show you some love. 😀✌🏾
OH MY GOD THAT IS SO CUTE
Cats just jump around with babies in their mouth?  Crazy
I want to experience this
Those are beautiful kittens!
pfft, sign of trust that's a dump and run!
Title should read “A mother cat bringing her kittens to her human’s bed, that’s now her bed, as a sign of feline dominance”
<3
I’m screaming
Well, now you're stuck in bed forever. You can never move.
Or like, "hey, your bed in this temp controlled room is better than the box on the outside corner of the house." Why do people think cats doing something is anything more than making thier own lives better. Cats are the Karen's of the animal kingdom.
Now you guys be good, mama needs to go get her drank on!
Actually, she's saying, "I just want to go out and party with my girlfriends, just for an hour, I promise"
All other cuteness aside, those are some grade-A r/PeanutWhiskers
More like *here you watch these lil demons while I go to the pub, momma needs a break*
Is there a full clip of this
You have no idea how much I wish for this at some point on my life.  All my kitties have been fixed.
This is the first post that actually made me say "Aww" involuntarily, what kind of voodoo witchcraft are you practicing on this sub?
#W H O L E S O M E  1 0 0
As if everyone doesn't have their mom babysit for them
Cuídame a los plebes comadre
What kind of cat is this? Super cute
I can't stop hearing that cat's inner dialogue in the voice of Linda Belcher. "Hey. Hey, food lady! You gotta help me with these freakin' kittens!"
😂😂😂😂😂
Free babysitter
“Here, you deal with the little shits”
Aww so cute
Or she's just looking for a free kittensitter
Well done, your a glorified kitten heater.
gfycat
Or a sign that she’s not scared of a weak human
 Always check your bed before sitting on it.
Omg
what kind of cat is this? very interesting eyes/markings
She found a great spot.
That’s no sign of trust, that’s the creature claiming the bed as their territory. Disgusting.
Dropping the kids off to daycare
"Stay close to the mobile heater, kids. I'm going to go get food for the winter."
The kittens are definitely looking to suckle on the human but cant figure it out
You will be safe down here kits.
I remember my cat doing that when she had kittens. They were just born and she decided to carry them to my bed when I was cleaning. ♥️
Will the owner be betraying this poor Mama cat? Not to many cat owners want to own an entire litter.
I would wait literal days if I had to pee
I let out an audible gasp when the other kitties showed up lol I wasn’t ready for that level of cutenesss
Is that all of them jeez Tom why didn't you use safety
That is heaven right there
Sign of trust.. sure. 

"Yall piss and shit here then come back home, I'm tired"
She looked back over shoulder and meowed “You good?”


... that was 6 weeks ago. She hopped out the window and I haven’t seen her since.
cute
Yeah good luck with that.. my cat did this and a few hours later the bed was coverd in kitten poop :/
Mom cat: Here, YOU watch them for awhile!
"I haven't slept in two weeks, it's your turn to take care of these little shits."
“HEY HOOMAN, CHECK THESE OUT”
She's all, I'm DONE. They keep mewing at me. You take over, imma go for smokes.
That momma is just looking for a babysitter so she can hang out with the girls.
Hehe I like the cave
It’s also a sign that the bed is cozy and full of blanket
That's IT!!!!!!  You're ALL going to Grandma's. 😬  😉
is the kitty okay? looks kinda...
“They are your problem now. Feed them”
“Hey hooman...can you watch these for me real quick? I gotta make a run to the store...need anything?”

Seriously though...an honor above all. True faith and trust there
I would cry
My cat tried this once in my parents room. My mum woke up, though a rat snuck in and tried to hit her with her pillow. We built a little area in the garage so this wouldn't happen again.
That’s cute ☺️
So you say!!! I think they are just trying to steal th covers!!!! And, you have no say in it!!!!😂😂😂😂that’s too beautiful!!!!!♥️♥️♥️♥️🥰🥰🥰🥰
Reminds me of me, except I don’t give them to someone as a sign of trust, I just can’t  afford a babysitter.
Aww. So sweet! The trust is heartwarming.
Yessssss
It’s hard to see other’s live out your dreams
Why wouldn't a cat trust it's babies?
So cute and adorable!❤️
very wholesome uwu
reasons i want to raise kittens!!!!
Cozy
This is why I want a cat
What breed of cat is this??
"I need some of that catnip Mr. Human, should 3 kittens cover it???"
I fucking love animals
Cats don’t trust no one, it brought the kitten so the owner can eat it.
Thank you for this. I really needed it.
“Here. You can have some love.”
When I was little my sister's cat escaped for a wild 3 months on the town and came back pregnant... After she had the babies she would dump them in our room at night so she could sleep in bed with my sister while they played (Read: Tore the room apart dresser drawer by dresser drawer)
I think I would have cuteness overload if this ever happened to me! A dream come true!
My service human will help me protect and love you
Trust...there is no substitute.
What does it mean when a cat brings her three kittens *under* the bed? My friend had a feral cat give birth to five kittens in her back garden. Two died, and the rest disappeared.  She feared a coyote must have got them. A couple of days later she found mom and the kittens under her son's bed! 

And they all lived with her happily ever after.
I've already seen this 5 times in hot why does it keep being reuploaded
I want sound so bad!
What a beautiful kitty and kittens. They have eyebrows!
True exact thing happened to onr of our mother cats. She brought all 6 of her kittens overnight when my father asked what happened to them.
So precious!
You meant "servant's bed" right?
Omg what an honor!! Anyone who has ever had a pet knows this!!
Two of my cats gave birth on my lap, does that mean double trust?
Lolz, this Mom-cat needs a good meal and a long nap.  She's saying, "Hey, watch these guys for me, I'll be right back".  Then she's gonna eat some salmon and catch a quick nap in the sunlight.
 Do they get sad when it’s time to get rid of the liter?
Anybody know the specific breed???
That’s how my mom developed her cat allergy.
I’ll take one! 🖐
I just think the cat stills wants to party and not have the responsibility of kittens.
every mothers is very protective of her children even its cat mom or human mother <3
Here. You take them. I’m done with their shit. Bye.
Check out muh bebes
I remember camping at a local lake and a cat was super friendly, loved being rubbed on her belly, which should have clued me in. I caved and let her sleep in my tent that night. Woke up to her caterwauling...and newborns on my left. Super cute, but not something I expected to wake up to for sure...
"They're your problem now."
“Heeeey Becky.. I know I said this was the last time ... but could you watch my children for me this morning ... I just don’t want to ...oh also Christopher jr has been having straight diarrhea this morning.... kay thaaaaaanks....
FYI: Cats and other animals that are dependent on care-givers do this to let their owners know that there are more mouths to feed and take care of. We may interpret it as a sign of trust (and in a sense that is true) but the cat is doing this for other reasons.
Everyone's all "aww" and as someone who has had newborn puppies in their life, I'm all "nononononooo put them back in their bed where they won't get piss and shit on the sheets!"
I would feel so honored
Cat moms always seem too small for their babies. Like a baby kitten is the same size as some puppies, but a cat is a quarter the size of a medium dog.
At first I thought it was a rat until I read the title
Beautiful cat!
Use your teeth to bite the loose skin on the back of your hand, you can get a reasonably good grip and barely feel it.
Maybe the cat is just done with 'em and basically saying, "you think they're so damn cute, you take 'em."
I think she is just saying “your turn to look after them”
I would die of happiness if this happened to me.
Everyone’s looking for affordable child care these days.
Heart. Melted.  I miss having a nursing baby next to me every night...and it’s been 7 years.🤣
"Watch them for me for a while, I gotta go do cat things."
You've got this wrong. She brings her kitten so that the hooman she own watch them.
Aww, so sweet!! :)
Good dog
My cat had her kittens on my bed in the middle of the night while I was sleeping
I accept the allergies
Mine its always trying to bring them to my room and bed too
Hooman, it’s your shift, k? I need a drink. I know, pump & dump.
Free babysitting
That’s certainly adorable and everything, but please, SPAY AND NEUTER YOUR PETS PEOPLE!!!
All those poor cats got hotboxed
SO PRECIOUS!!! 

((I am screaming internally, you are so so lucky!!))
This definitely made me think AWW lol
What breed of cat is that?
that’s like sooooooo cute
My cat gave birth on top.of my sleeping son.
'Here human, these whiney shit machines are your problem now'
Do dogs do this as well? This is too cute.
"Dont worry babies, it's safe here"
Oh, look at mama. So sweet!
She’s tucking them in for bedtime!
My cat used to do this to me and it was the cutest shit. I would be sitting in front of my pc with the sun directly hitting my back,and so she would pick them one by one and put them in a circle around my back in the sun and wander off to eat and rest. (I had a baby chick who loved sitting on my lap and my cat would get jealous and force her way to my back and sit against it)
Or because bed is soft af
Free babysitting!
It looks like it hurts ngl
Given it’s a purebred it’s probably been artificially inseminated. That cats just like, I woke up with these thanks to you, you take care of them now.
I don't want this. You have it.
When mama cat looks like a kitten herself it quadruples the cute lol
Awe
“Warm them up with your farts”
I love how she's on the look out for predators, like a hawk is just going to swoop in from the closet and snatch a kitten from the comforter.
You take care of these too now.
Like my sweetest cat...love it😘😘
What is the breed of the cat? I need to know thats the cutest cat I've ever seen
This is, "here, hold these, mama needs a nap." 😸
What if someone lays on the bed without lifting the blankets
You're wrong, but trust me, you wouldn’t
Now get that cat fixed
What breed of cat is that?
I love that there's a kitten insertion hole
"Here, take these. I need a break."
No sound 😡
What does it mean when the cat gives birth in your bed cuz that was one weird ass way to wake up as a kid
Oh my God imagine waking up on a Saturday late morning to lil kitty cats on top of you mewimg
I don't know if this is right, but I let my german shepherd bite my hands as a sign of trust, I tell him "I know what your chompers can do and I know you" in return he's gentle and licks me after every bite
I love the way she looks around to see if anyone knows where she’s taking her babies.
something about the way they carry kittens by their neck don't sit well with me
Beautiful kitty cave, beautiful momma, beautiful babies  :)
Here is my sacrifice hooman, now where is my cat food.
Alright, I’ll be back shortly say like 3 hours I just need to shower and have some me time. Cat doesn’t return until next week.
I approve of this beast and her family of smol babbies
she wants a baby sitter!
Im tired. Your turn now.
Mama cat: this Huumann is very warm snuggle her to steal her warmth.
My dog (mutt) helped our cat move her kittens. So cute.
Maybe it's just me but I feel weird about humans being considered the 'owner' of an animal. At best I'm a custodian, at worst, they own me.
“They’re YOUR responsibility now!”
Is there a sub for mama cats carrying baby cats in their mouth???
"Sorry, I can't make it into work today...."
Who has the time to actually wear silk pajamas?
~~Owner~~ slave FIFY
Aww she made them a fort
Do you realize how blessed it must feel to have that happen on your bed
She's pretty much dumping the kids with the grandparents!
I had a cat wake me up at 2am to give birth on my pillow next to my head. Ultimate trust or just an asshole?
"I gots things to do.  You look after them."
😍
“I trust you with my mudafukin kittens ya hear”
One cat had her kittens on me while I slept. What's that a sign of?
I love how she's checking like counting 1......2......3...
Are we just gonna ignore how cute that cat is
Get in the p i t my child
"I'm gonna have a ladies night with my friends. You babysit my kitties."
babeys
I would never leave that bed
This is so nice, our cat won't let us touch her babies. Lol!
r/lynxpointsiamese
I really like cats , they’re way of showing affection , trust, and loyalty is so sweet and genuine, since they don’t show it as often as dogs it also feels very rewarding when they do show love
As a sign of “I just need a 30 minute break, please god, just 30 minutes...”
Is it a sign of trust when your cat tries to give birth right next to you while you are sleeping?
“Here my kitties, meet your slave”
These will be the best socialized kittens ever
“I’m just gonna leave this here, I have to run to the store for some cigarettes.”
Here bitch you watch these things for a while, they are loud
...how about her bringing her kittens as a sign of "yo watch these brats for a while, yeh? Thanks, my tongue's got a hot date with my butthole tonight, I gotta go get ready!"
Wow, what beautiful cats.
Help me out with these little fur balls, they won't stop maowing
Da fuk do I do with these things?
And I thought humans were the only animals out of all evolution to drink the milk of other animals.
Omg as owner that must feels heavenly
breakfast in bed
This fucks me up 😭😭❤️
5 years ago a outdoor cat that I gave treats to jumped through my open window and tried giving birth on my bed, I ended up laying towels down on closet floor and staying up with her all night as she gave birth, I found all 5 kittens good homes, I got mama cat fixed and we’ve been best buddies since then, she’s a 24/7 house cat now and she’s spoiled
What a beautiful momma!
Ok ok I thought I was a dog person but that won me over that was very cute
She deserves some good back scratchies
Or maybe it’s telling her kittens: if the shiny pink human expires we can have it for food.
Are you gonna be here for a while? I have some errands to run. Can you just watch them for a bit? I promise I'll be right back.
Protect my babies hooman :)
it *is* a sign of trust but she doesn't do it *as* a sign of trust; she doesn't give a shit if you know that she trusts you. she's just trying to keep her kittens safe.
How adorable!!! I wod love to experience that!!
Cool
Trust or exasperation?

So cute. The mama cat looks pretty young herself!
my cat gave birth IN my bed) I was like- why are my feet wet?
Cute
Thats very interesting top comment and so frikin cute!
Now you feed them...
Grandma’s gotta help with the kids.
Do not have kittens people.
Do that thing where you feed me but now all of us
My cat seemed very scared and stressed when it was time for her to deliver. She constantly screamed while walking around in circles, and then she jumped up on my lap and gave birth to four kittens right there on my lap. It was very emotional and touching. I helped her free one of the kittens from the sack too, they came very fast. Then she went down to the bed I had made for her when I found out she was pregnant, rested with her kittens for an hour, and then suddenly a fifth one just fell out of her!
Random question I’ve been keeping in my head for some time: does it hurt the kittens when the cats take them by their neck?
Man this is so cool
;’(
So cute
Damn hate it when my hay fever comes out of nowhere.
The Cat: Hey Carly could you be a sweetie and watch my kids, I got to quickly get some fishsticks and knit rolls from the store and be back in a few. 

Plot twist: *Sneaks out majestically* Time to find me some good feline who can break these curves.
Here you keep these little shits!

OR... 

Cat: This is my bed now!
I had a cat that didn't feel comfortable giving birth until she was either between my legs or beside me. I was only 8 so learned and witnessed a beautiful lesson that day.
wow
Is the right method to pick up babies of cat. Hold skin above neck from top side.
You are assuming that its the owner's bed, and the person with the camera/phone is the owner.

It could just be someone waking up to find a cat that they have never seen before hiding some kittens in their bed.
She's proud of her litter and your approval matters to her.
My kitty did that when she had babies. I’d wake up in the middle of the night because there would be little creatures crawling around
Omg the sweetest thing ❤❤
Or she wanted to say ''I've been taking care of these kittens for a while now, I need a break. You deal with them.''
wait do cats actuly grab kittens by their neck??
Beautiful
Cats
r/tuckedinkitties
More like mama needs a break watch these for a bit
My cat did this when she had kittens, except I didn't know about them so she just dropped a random kitten on my bed.
I love how cats are just paused when you scruff them.
What the owner should really do is spay their cats. Lord knows we have enough of the hundreds of thousands of cats dying every year in shelters and streets.
Mother cat trustingly brings babies to owner. Owner: sells kittens
This is truly something adorable. And I don't say that often on this sub.
Our old cat.  Ate all his kittens, before that I had no idea that cats can eat their own children.
Whose bed ?
🥺❤️
*Thees are my bebis* *Pls watch them for me.*
She’s trying to get a babysitter is what she’s doing. Girl needs a break.
I don't mean to judge, but that momma cat doesn't look old enough to be having sex.
Cat
When my cat had babies she was too scared to pick them up, she was afraid to hurt them
My cat just dropped them off on us like we were daycare and went outside to roam around and have fun.
My mum’s cat did that with her too
Cute
Catto trust is good. Catto trust is precious.
She's not gonna trust you so much though when you give her kittens away... 🤗😾
I bring thee thy offering, oh great one!
Those times you regret jumping into bed
I'm a dude and I went "Awwwwwww." I'm such a marshmallow as I get older, lol.
I don’t the babies to pee in my bed, shoooot.
Daddy went to the corner store to get some 'nip and never came back.
"YOU watch them, I'm taking a nap...for 16 hours!"
All i can think here is IRRESPONSIBLE. Unless you’ve saved these... very irresponsible to not have spayed/neatered your cat.
Or a sign of offering. You know, when cats bring their prey to their owners?.. I'm kidding ofc
My wife tried and tried to nurse our son who was born early. While in the hospital we were given breast milk and milk when we needed until he could be feed formula.
The hospital was apart of a breastmilk donation /exchange program.
When I lived in the countryside there was a sort of mother dog and mother cat, who were the matriarchs of the place. They sometimes took care of each other’s babies.
My cat tried to give birth while laying on my lap. By the time I completely understood her intentions her water had already broken all over my jeans. We had a little chat and decided she could labor BESIDE me, not on me. I got to catch 4 healthy cute as f kittens that day. Me and mama cat have a close bond. We’ll just leave it at that.
This isn't just "**I trust you**", this is her telling you "**I will walk into fire and burn alive to save them and I trust you to do the same for them**"
What a good mamma!
Now you can never leave the bed
What breed is this? Sorry if this was already asked and answered, I cant find it anywhere! 

Trying to convince the boyfriend to let me get a cat and I think this video could win him over!
What a great hidey hole!
I love the “now don’t you dare come out of here” look at the kitten at the end lol
Keep them warm, make sure they sleep before sun high!
What an adorable, and heartwarming sight!

My beautiful girl is spayed, but I always thought she'd have such beautiful babies. I'd also like to think she would bring her kittens to me just like this.

I guess it's better off that she's spayed, cause I would keep all the kittens!!!
Sweet and rare!
Cat: their your problem now 😹
Don't trust that human. They didn't spay you.
I needed this
LOL. I love how people try to attribute human characteristics to animal behavior. "As a sign of trust"... Definitely cute, because kittens, but it looked to me like the mamma cat saw a comfy den made out of pillows and decided it was a more suitable location for her brood. I seriously doubt the cat was thinking "I shall make a grand gesture with my kittens to demonstrate to the human that I trust them."

Although, what do I know? I'm an artist, not a catologist.
So adorable! Thanks for making me smile! Love me some kitties!!
Ok kids, this is YOUR bed now. Spend every day reminding this hoomin that.
“Here my kitties, meet your slave”
"I just want all my cuddle buddies together". Also it could've been "Your turn I'm taking a break".
I have never owned in my life. I wanna know how do they get pregnant. do it with a stray,?????
I think its less about trust and more about feeding her children and picking up their shit tho
O my Godess, how they are so beautiful 🤩😍🤩
"I'm tired of these little shits",  "here hooman"
Holy shit, why does this get reposted every two days by karma farmers.
Bold of you to assume that's her owner's bed. She owns her owner so that's her bed.
"here I'm tired, take care of my biscuits" 😅
Aww, she holds her kitten like a lioness would
OMG..this is so adorable 😍 Mother's nature is just amazing.. always caring.loving it.
She did it for the warmth. Nothing more
“Hooman is nice, we will be safe here”
Cute. But also the bed will have shit and piss
"I shall sacrifice my little ones for more food"
My cat give birth on me once it was sweet but also quite nasty
Aww there so cute
I wonder how much piss and shit will be on that bed now lol
How do you know it's a sign of trust? Maybe she hates the kitten and wants you to sacrifice it to lord cthulhu.
Guess the blankets make a better den
Imagine coming home after a long day and just yeetign yourself on the bed without noticing
"This is your problem now".
Imagine just jumping on the bed after a hard day of work.. crunchy
Could just be that she knows it as a safe space.
Cute
What breed is the cat? 😻
Haha poor lil buddy getting hauled around like he's a dead mouse haha "hErE u gO hOoMaN"
Spay and neuter your pets.
Reeeeeeepost
Is that a Burmila
Meanwhile my cat, attempts to give birth on top of 
me decides, she is to cool to give birth in a nice ass box that was prepared for her a month in advance when first option was denied. Brings me her two kittens. A week passes suddenly decides she is not cool with them getting attention, proceeds to drop them off the bed and then acts like nothing happened whilst demanding belly rubs
She said: I really need a nap rn. Take care of these 3 would ya?
How doesn‘t it hurt the babys? (Biting in the neck and lifting them like that)
"Karen, im going to work, mind babysitting my kids?"
Everybody gangsta until the kittens are breastfed by you...
Ahhhh, that nice warm spot under the duvet
Nope.. That's a sign of... You freaking take them. I'm done.. Lol
what a pretty comforter and an even prettier cat lol
Nah, shes dropping em off so she can go out to the Milk Bar
Cute!
This stuff always blows my mind. Even like, a cat or dog falling asleep on me is incredible. 
This small animal loves me so much that they feel completely safe and content in my presence. I've never had a momma cat, but if I did and she did this, I'd probably lose my mind over how adorable it is.
 *you don’t “own” cats.
'You watch them, yeah? I'm out for a drink.'
Okay but what if she gives birth on top of you?
Free nanny while she goes out partying
 And then she sells the kittens for a bag of weed 🥴
I once had 2 cats who gave birth a few days within each other, one of the mother's just was not interested in taking care of her litter, one day I noticed the one who gave a shit carry all the kittens to her bed, it was cute at first but no way I was letting her feed 9 kittens. I'm pretty sure she only had 8 nipples anyway so we pretty much had to make the other mother start to do her part and luckily she did.
I had a stray cat that I had for about a week or so do the same thing
Cutest ever!
My cat HAD her kittens in my bed
awesome cat.
Please if someone can point out the breed, i would be quite grateful
Never a better example of why you should spay and neuter.
Here human... Babysit.
imagine the owner sat on the kittens without seeing them
There’s no where safer then your mama’s mama’s bed
“I’m DONE.  You wouldn’t get me fixed, so now you deal with them.”
I didn’t see this as a sign of trust, but more so “Here you take them.”  Lol
So cute 😿
So you brought food?
So cute
Blanket den tingz.
*eats kits*
Omg so adorable. I’d like to submit an application to the mamma cat for one of her kittens 😁
You think that is trusting?  When I was about twelve, I woke up to our Siamese cat giving birth.  Laying on my chest.  I was watching the third kitten, mid delivery, inches below my chin.
The cat had just finished removing the amniotic sac, when my mother peeked in to see why my light was on.  The cat freaked out, scrambling to hide the kittens.  It was weeks before she let anyone but herself, the male cat, or me near them.
She looks like a baby herself
I don’t understand. Were the kittens up on a windowsill in a pile of stuffed animals before this?

Oh good, breeding cats! What a good citizen you are!
As a sign of trust?  They like the dark place as opposed to the light place.  Don’t make shit up.
*whispers* it's not a sign of trust, it's the mother putting her kittens in the warmest, comfiest place
Why are we celebrating bad pet ownership?
I thought she was carrying a dead cat, cuz my previous cat did that with mice. I had a heart attack
Forbidden cat food yes I know that cats do this to carry their children
