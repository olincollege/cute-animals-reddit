Stay safe, its like an apocalypse.
Why is this on r/aww

Is it because u are like awwww, look at me I’m about to die
It'd be beautiful if it weren't so damned depressing
Wait, how is this r/aww?
r/funnyandsad  good luck down there, 2020 really wasn't done yet.
The sun just popped and its oozing all over the sky like an egg yolk.
What is /r/aww about this?
# RULE 1:

# No "sad" content
How does this belong on r/aww? I thought this was r/pics for a minute. No offence but I think this is the wrong sub.
This is truly terrifying. And also hysterical  (that *this is fine* dog is my spirit animal). Stay safe!!!
Where’d you get that stuffed dog!?
I thought we weren't allowed sad posts?
Is this really on r/aww??? Lmao
Wrong sub?
I’m sorry but how the hell did this get on r/aww
Wrong sub.
Near the holiday farm fire in Oregon, same deal, lol. I can't believe you even went outside, your air quality is probably even worse than ours.
Any relation?

You should properly credit Jared Petty!
aww, the world is on fire.
Someone delete this stupid post.  Nothing at all is aww about people losing their lives and homes, plus the devastating destruction of animals and the environment
r/LostUpvoters this is a good one
First: thats pretty scary, stay safe

Second: I want that plushy
Karens : The wildfire is a hoax pls come to my baby daddy's gender reveal party tomorrow
Can we please keep depressing stuff out of /r/aww please. It is my safe place.
Mostly peaceful forest.
This isn't r/aww, you're not talking like a 2 year old.
Does orange mean it’s a boy or a girl?
Ik this is bad and all but it is beautiful. I wish i could be there to see it honestly.
That is super creepy and scary. I don't understand how people can stay in California and the surrounding areas when they burn like that summer after summer?
It’s like the solar eclipse a few years ago, just not so cool now.
Why are you guys so nonchalant about this when it literally looks like an apocalypse is unfolding there?
Due to Covid all those prisoner firefighters cant be out there and they make a huge part of the help. America is one fucked up place. Fires made worse by our lack of slave labor. Maybe fund more firefighters and fund less riot gear.
I'm an Aussie.  Our hearts are with you.  We understand just how terrifying this is.  I hope everyone comes through this.  Please stay safe.
Oh wow! where can I buy this toy?
Nice picture from twitter you found to karma farm. Give credit where its due.
I’m so happy I didn’t move to the USA in 2019
Nothing to see here, keep buring the dinosaur juice.
Dawg it's 8:21pm here
That's the fire in the background right? Before I go ooh pretty sunset.
Stay safe out there
Blade Runner 2020
Really? Oh wow. I thought I woke up on the Colonies of Mars.
This is still so wild to me. I can’t imagine how strange and stressful it must be to have midday look like this.
That is nothing im near the oregon fires and i couldn't see the sun today because it was blocked out by smoke i have video of it
That is THE plushie for that situation.
That looks like some apocolyptic type shit...damn.
But wait, isn't man made climate change a lie?
So this all started because of two people???
Holy moly. Stay safe xx
Not sure what this is doing in this sub but funny pic nonetheless
tbh *this is fine* applies to all of the united states in 2020
In El Cerrito it was dark outside until 1pm.  Fucking weird.
What year is it? Oh yeah, 2020.
[Same here in oakland](https://i.imgur.com/hRE3RE6.jpg)
Mother nature thinks that we should all feel 2020, deep inside where we scream.
I woke up this morning thinking it was sunrise but I checked my watch and it said 11:40. Confused the hell outta me
This plush toy is adoreable. I need one.
[deleted]
Where can I get that plushie?
You Legend 🥇
I need that plushie!
didnt Nat King Cole sang a song about orange colored sky?
I know it’s 2020 but after the last few years I feel like California being on fire is pretty much the norm
be safe.
Does anyone know where I can get one of these?
Why is this here? People are losing everything and you people think it's cute?
How is this “r/aww” material?
People still making fun of a catastrophe.

Appalling.
Why do I feel like this is some bible like prophecy being fulfilled?
I aspire to be this chill, but stay safe
Nothing to see here.
Which way are you facing?
I’m in Ashland a few miles from the almeda fire and somehow completely lucked out with no smoke since it moved north. Stay safe!
Rtx on
Uh id leave asap. Stay safe!!
[This comes to mind...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJhgwxSTHDs)
This feeling of perpetual sunset is fucking with my sleep cycle
The perfect real meme picture doesn't exis....
It's like he was just a millisecond flash.
The sun swallowing up Earth as it enters its red giant phase.. Colourised.
Just saw pics like that from Oregon. We're in Colorado and the snow is just melting. The sky looked like that two days ago. The surprising part is that I wasn't that surprised...
Are the people behind this gender reveal party gonna be punished ?
😂
Should've raked those forests. /s
I keep seeing people ask if 2020 can possibly get any worse, and the answer is without a doubt that it can get WAY worse than this.
But is it High Noon?
All but like one day in January was like this in Melbourne and Sydney
Y’all better watch out. This is what the sky looks like before the zombies invade.
I love that he's sitting on a trash can.
Where can I buy that plushie? 😍
Lmao yes. I woke up this morning and was like “is the sky orange”?
KC Green would be proud and/or worried for us
META!
Hi, I don’t know anything about these fires, also it seems like this has become an annual occurrence also why is Oregon effected so dramatically also I love you please be my momdog
I need that plush....

NOW
Is it worse than previous years? Is it arsons?
Hey person, this is socal weather, how dare you steal our global warming!
Aww

Here can I get on plushie like that one?
“The Green Dream or whatever they call it.” -House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D).
Oh dear.
Even more poignant if your finger wasn't over the lens...
Just another noon in California
2020

Can you please

Give us a break
Is that fire or the sun hitting the clouds?
It's a dog day afternoon
Where can I get that plushie???
Which chapter of book of Revelation we're at now? 2020 is metal (and mental)
This is nice
Ok that plushie is really cute
*It's high noon...*
Didn’t Jared Petty take this pic on Twitter? Cite your sources, my guy.
Can you give me  a link from where you bought the plushie? Thanks!
Sorry, i'm out of the loop. California is on fire. Again or still? How long has this been going on now?
Where can I purchase him?
I want that dog
We’re doing stuffed animals here now?
Didn't marc maron predict this a couple years ago. Or is this more common in california.
Is this the same fire that was started by the Gender Reveal?
a bit offtopic... has anyone checked works of the creator if this toon? the rest of his cartoons are mind blowingly stupid
Boy or girl?
That plushie is too cute! I want one
Basically this is what it feels like to live in Australia. Every summer.
Should I be worried🔥😨🇨🇦🤔
Cute enough
More like r/awwtf
The Sun has gone into a Solar Maximum which causes some weird 💩
Yes, this morning scared me quite a bit. Or, lack of morning, I should say...
Air quality must be terrible too. How do you manage to breathe?
For me in Vallejo, CA it was darker by 1:30 that shit is wild
Truth is stranger than fiction
Please stay safe everyone ❤️❤️
Glad to see fallout new vegas in real life is what I can look forward to
It looks like The Lion King, that band of clouds has animal shapes running through it.
I'm so sorry that this happened. Take care and stay safe!
Wow that sky reminds me of the Bugaboo Fires in Florida back in middle school. Our school was evacuated and it looked like that when we went outside to the buses. Scary shit, stay safe.
That would be more cute if ash wasn’t falling from the sky at where I live
This is the best photo ive ever seen
The sky is colored like the fire: **15 wholesome awards**
Y’know, when I worked in San Francisco twenty years back, it struck me how similar the Bay Area was to back home in Melbourne (Australia). 

Cultured, diverse, artsy...

Sky red from bushfire smoke...

Now if you could make a decent coffee I’d be back there in a heartbeat!
Looks like the Oakland Hills fire back in the day
Can someone tell Netflix they’re taking this live adaptation of Avatar: The Last Airbender a little too far?
She’ll be right, I live in Melbourne and remember the sky being like that. Just make sure you don’t spend too much time in open air - another reason to wear a mask ay.
Aww?
it's almost like decades of incompetent leadership have led CA down the shitter
Is this a motel? Or apartment building?
This post is gonna go to 100k upvotes 🤣🤣
Jesus fucking Christ.
The giant mushroom shaped nuclear explosion is missing in the picture
My dad is down there, shit’s really like an apocalypse.

Hellscape.
Where can I get that plushie? I want ittt
Can you tell if it’s a boy or a girl from there?
As an aussie i relate and sympathise for you
sorry if I sound silly, but is this normal? I know yearly fires are a thing in the US (I’m from the UK, we don’t have fire yet) so is this a thing that happens often or is this a unique first time thing?
I have a strong desire to find this plushie and buy it as soon as possible.
Bro. Where did you get that plushie and can I have one?
It’s closer to 8:30.... 2020 must be flexing another way to fuck us. We all have been waiting for 2021, not realizing that 2020 can freeze time.
The emission.
Wild fires?
The enemy ascended beyond your control
Hope the OP and the cute dog stay safe out there :)
But seriously which arsehole said "well, at least 2020 can't get worse..."?
News picked up this fire quicker than the Aussie one, took people 5 months.
Sauron's a comin'
You know. I still can't tell if it's a boy or a girl.
RED SUN OVER PARADISE
Where can I buy this
And thanks for making me a new background picture
Repost
Hey at least we know it’s a boy
First it was us in aus but now you poor guys have to deal with it
Damn, that looks apocalyptic. Is this from the same fire that the gender reveal party led to?
Lol this is perfect. Be safe though!
So sweet
One of the clouds looks like a lion.
Shit's on fire, yo!
Where can a get that plush?
This is too good! But not wild fire.
What the hell is "aww" about these fires?!?
Why its look like the lobby in hell ?
Yea baby, this is every year from here. Oh, except it will get worse!
A relic of the past
Is anyone going to credit this photo?
I thought for a second he was Godzilla size
Cali: fires
Me: vibin in Australia at the start of spring

Really tho hope everyone is good and safe over there
Everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked
the end of days is upon us!! repent now!
Omg
Wait so is it a boy or a girl?
When the sky loves Driver San Francisco a lot
Where do I get that plush
Why no that "dog"(?) isn't creepy at all
This is too good. Hope you're all staying safe out there!
It's the Upsidedown! Watch out for Demogorgons!
Idk whether to laugh or cry
i really like the orange cause there is no detail in my city its just pitch orange
Wonder what the 2020 season finale has for us?
What the man saw when he looked out the hotel window in *The Road*.
But y does it look like that
Why is the sky orange?
It’s morning in America
Nailed it
Probably should buy a boat.
he deserved it, didn’t leave until noon.
Where is that dog from?
By fancy the Bus Cause 'we have someone live in Here?
I didn't know Jared Petty posted on reddit.
2020 already played the fires card. How'd they get another copy?
Someone put a blond comb over wig on that pooch.
ITS NOW MADNESS
I would like to know how this is affecting people psychologically. All the turmoil going on in politics, covid, protest. 

And now the shy matches the mood of the world.
How about no pyrotechnic activities. 
Put a blue or pink filling in that freaking cupcake.
Oh lovely
2020 am i right
High Noon demons coming irl
Just had to go buy this plush doll. Thanks.
I got it! Hell is about to teleport to san francisco right under our noses and bring the DOOM universe with it, why else would doom Eternal come out in 2020 i ask?
> This is fine

Fine is what the people that caused it will get.
This picture doesn’t really capture how dark it was.
~~San Francisco~~

You mispelled Moordor.
Oh God!  Please stay safe out there!
Jared!?!?
Is this from the reveal party fire or was this from the previous wildfire that started a few months back?
The Slayer has entered.
This isn’t fucking aww lol think about the people losing their homes and actual pets
This photo is going to be annoyingly popping up everywhere for the next week, isn’t it?
r/awesomestuff
It got out of the house. Progress!
Can someone help me out. Did these fires happen because of a gender reveal party?
Classic
Semi related question but, does anyone know whats going to happen to the people responsible for that gender reveal stunt?
Thank you for this awesome wallpaper
This should be the image for a new subreddit called the 2nd half of 2020. We could post each new epic disaster as we wait for the US election results.
The Spice is in the air itself.
I mean... He's cute...
\*\* forest fires to own the libs \*\*
how the fuck are wildfires aww?
I woke up at 9am and thought it was 5am.
I live in Sf, and it's a mf apocalypse there!
Mori mori mori mori mori moricho radioooooo
So is this like a sad "aww" instead of a cute one?
Mods where you at, at least leave a sticked comment saying you normally delete this stuff
Wait, is this picture not photoshopped/filtered in any way??
Well don’t leave us hanging.. was it a boy or a girl?
Also live in SF and the sky yesterday was creepy af! Great picture, thanks for sharing!
This has a lot of meme potential
Do another view with the furry
are those clouds in the back? the bright orange
i live in arizona and at night, some of the sky is lit orange from the fires. it’s crazy
Is that real? Oh my...
I NEED THAT PLUSHIE NOW
I like the stuffed animal
I don't think this is fine
You stole this from Jared Petty’s Twitter, caption and all.
Did you steal Jared Petty’s picture and not credit him?
Can someone recreate this as a drawing?
It seems almost post apocalyptic
It’s Fire O’clock somewhere
Credits to Jared Petty, by the way.
/r/pics instead maybe? There's nothing "aww" about this.
Can you buy that plush?
Are those mountains of flames in the background? If so it's extra terrifying.
Keep burning those fossil fuels dawg
Can someone shop a maga hat onto him please?
Vote
I need that plush.
So everyone is talking about environmentalism and the end of days......but I wanna know where to get that plush?
ORANGE ALERT
Republicans and corporate-centrist dems.
Why'd you wait 10 hours to post the pic, tho?
I feel like if kc green saw this he’d find a way to complain about it
Its a boy!
Does the yellow sky mean it's a baby girl or baby boy or which one of the 300 genders?
"Everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked."
Are all these fires I’ve seen on the news directly related to the gender reveal fiasco?
Why is this here, should be in r/Warhammer40k
Is that real?!

The stuffed dog I mean. The Apocalypse I know is real.
How awesome would it be if SF got wiped out. Such a trash city, the only way to really clean it is by fire.
>it's noon in San Francisco

Why is everybody talking about the fires in California? Australia had huge bushfires last year.
Damn! That view! I miss living out there. What is this world coming to?
Are you sure it's not 23:59? because it looks like the end of days.
Anyone else think the backdrop looks like something out of an nes game?
Finally, someone did it!

Where do I buy this?
Does that look like a wall of fire to anyone else?
life imitates art, well art and memes
It's probably because of that pedophile bill.
It is not noon in SF right now
That is a weird and unfunny post. Fires raging everywhere? People losing their homes? Haha funny cartoon dog meme!!! Everything fine guys!! Upvotes to the left look how funny I am
that shit looks so fucking cool. i wish some idiot lit the forests on fire here so i could experience this
I can't even imagine all the urban single family homes that will be lost to this and areas blocked by nimbys that will have to be rebuilt. Its Such a shame.
End of the world. All the sheep need to wake up, a lot of people will die soon. The world as we once knew it is no more and things are only to get worse. 

If you really don’t believe this or think that everything will be alright - it won’t. Humanity is fucked.
I wish i had this cool of sunsets in windsor ON, cuz the most interesting sunset ive seen around there in the past like week was just a small magenta cut in the dark blue sky
