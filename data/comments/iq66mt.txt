If you listen towards the end, the guy blows air through his nose to try to scare the seal away. This is something that seals do when they feel threatened, so he is quite literally speaking their language. 

It just shows that he must deal with these guys a lot!
I‚Äôm now only going to greet my co-workers via sassy thigh slapping.
Hershel just wanted to see something rare these days, a real log driver.
Oh shit are you one of those guys that floats down river with the logs? That shit is hella dangerous. Stay safe my dude.
So, people seem interested in what we deckhands (not technically log drivers) do. If there's enough interest in an AMA I'd be happy to do one! Let me know!
At least he waves to say hi, he could be a real dick and act like you don't even exist.
How many girls in your DMs right now?
You have my seal of approval
When Hershel put his little flapper up I waved back.
Do you go burling down the white waters? [I hear that where the logdriver learns to step lightly](https://youtu.be/upsZZ2s3xv8)
Your coworker doesn‚Äôt seem to be in uniform, may wanna report him.
"Such a ballsy guy. We're friends now"

That's how all of the best friendships start.
what is your profession? I thought log drivers were a thing of the past (hope this doesn't come off as rude/offensive)
That is terrifying.  Unless that's like 2 feet of water I would not want to walk on those logs.
I‚Äôm from Arizona, please explain your job to me
Oooo you should do an AMA!
You‚Äôre handsome as hell my friend. Add they you‚Äôre clearly an animal lover...my goodness you better be married by now dude!
 Herschel is super chill dude that is a friend for life
New Brunswick? Where are they still log driving?
Whoa. I thought log driving was an extinct career. This is pretty neat just on your job alone. Hershel is an employee benefit.
Handsome.
Isn't walking on floating logs like that super dangerous.
Seal: "Draw me like one of your French girls"
Such an adorable poser.
The log driver's waltz pleases girls completely. 

This is pretty badass! I grew up in Canada watching the log driver's waltz and didn't know it was still a thing.
This man is attractive
No offense but he looks kind of lazy.  Does he always just lay around?
Just imagine what‚Äôs under the surface that he‚Äôs hiding from...

r/thalassophobia
I love the slaps! What a chill little guy
I love the energy you‚Äòre sending out! Hope that seal kept chilling with you for along time man! :)
You can ask any girl from the parish around, what pleases her most from her head to her toes

She'l say I'm not sure that it's business of yours, but I do like a waltz with a log driver, 

For they go barrelling down, down the white water, that's how the log driver learns to step lightly
What is this place?
Friendly waves
Terrifying workplace. One wrong step and you fall into the water and the logs close above you.
your blow and his subsequent flipper wave just made my week.
I have a feeling that this is in B.C, possibly the Fraser River
I have coworkers that look like that too ... well, that shape anyways
I am concerned about him, losing access to his habitat or something, and feel some kind of way because everyone else is like, ‚Äúooh cute seal!‚Äù Is he safe? Am I an alien? Too many questions.
Can we just take a second and thirst over this stupidly attractive man please, seals aside
Sir you cannot come onto reddit looking like you do and not expect to be cat called.
Hershel probably shows up every morning to say hello to this gorgeous man ü•∞
I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the grey
Seems like a chill dude
Gotta make sure those logs are signed sealed and delivered
i loved how the seal wawed hi
Cute. So is the seal. Having seen anything about log driving for a long time.
Hope he‚Äôs logged his hours
I was expecting to see a beaver lol
It‚Äôs not every job that comes with a seal of approval.
"Herschel"

That's a solid handle. You've done right by him
that is the cutest guy i‚Äôve ever seen
I‚Äôm not sure who is more adorable.
Amazing!! I know I‚Äôd rather have a coworker like this than my current ones!!
Tough question, 

Who cuter the guy or the seal?
Expected Beaver.
I'm pleasantly surprised you didn't fall in the water.
My "aww!" went to an "oh lord" the moment he turned that camera around. Goodness, what a handsome man.
So this is what you are up to when you don't film Lucifer?
I just googles why seals slap their belly and it's territorial. Not only is this seal not scared, he's saying this is MY log.
How many marriage proposals do we reckon op will get from this post? Im taking bets ;)
Don't scare them away! They need to rest after they eat.  They gorge themselves then need to rest or they'll drown. :(
His little wave omg
Glad to see Justin Trudeau already has another gig lined up.
[deleted]
Sea doggo!
Has anyone ever told you how absolutely handsome you are my dude.
Oh, hi co-worker!
[removed]
Seals look like real life plushie
He is funny
I like your dog's attitude.
I have scuba'ed with those sea dogs and can confirm they are super sweet little pups. They will come up and play with you until you run out of air.
p e t  h i m
That is too cute!
Do you ever feed them?
[deleted]
I love that his name is Hershel.
I see 2 cute things
I don‚Äôt care about the seal I care about the place you are at it is PRETTY EPIC
"it's log, log,
It's big, it's heavy, it's wood.
It's log, log,
Better than bad, it's good. ... 
Log, from [sean] BLAMMO!"
Wow never seen a real log driver. How long are your workdays just sitting with those logs watching them?
I thought this was a giant decapitated pig‚Äôs head sitting on the edge of the log, until he started waving.

https://imgur.com/a/t3yZWMQ
Expected a beaver but was not disappointed
Gets my seal of approval.
Oh my. I wanna be your friend...
he was like: ‚ö´Ô∏è„Ä∞Ô∏è‚ö´Ô∏è
Leopard seal....pretty sure Hershel can bite ya hand off if you get too close.
Guy: Morning Herschel

 *hahaha* 

*HISSSS* 

*hehehe so cute*

Herschel: First of, get the fuck away from me. Secondly, we are not friends. And third, my name is Steve you fucking twit.
It looks like your coworker is giving you the seal of approval
Are you... vlogging?
Are you the west coast of America? Cuz you‚Äôre fuckin HOT. lol

Sorry... too soon I know, but I can‚Äôt help myself sometimes.
Why tf did my eyes and brain make me see a cow's head first. It wasn't until he slapped himself that I saw it's a seal.
Omg, the aww factor here is your face! üòç
Expected a beaver. But this still gets my seal of approval.
I love how seals will do those slaps if they're a bit disgruntled. He's like fuck man just let me be!
Wish I had coins to give him the wholesome seal award
He wanted to be... A LUMBERJACK
Someone find hershel‚Äôs Reddit account we need to let him know he‚Äôs a star! I‚Äôm expecting it to be like u/Hersheltheseal
Please tell us how you got into this line of work! This is so cool!
How ablorbs
Super cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è I love it!
LEG
Ok this makes me smile. Ty.
good morning herschel
Hershel dont care. Hershel only seems to care about his comfort.
I‚Äôm so jealous!!!! Just make sure u 2 are careful around heavy lumber
Don't call me buddy friend.
Your co worker looks very polite
You made my day! Seriously, I LOVE seals.
He's just vibin
;; why are there logs in the water? Doesn‚Äôt that damage the wood...?
üò©üíú
Cute man with seal.
I was expecting a beaver, not gonna lie
Hate to be a whistleblower, but your coworker is lyin' down on the job.
Tiny concern.
tell him I said hi
Mhmmmm. Trying to guess your location. The sky and trees seem familiar. PNW?
OP: Pfffff

Hershel: I got u bro
Herschel is an excellent name for a seal
You‚Äôre cute. Herschel too lol
Heeee's a lumber seal and he's okay
That log has a seal of approval.
Is he waving or do seals smack their belly's to assert dominance? I'm genuinely curious
He sounds like Jacksepticeye
I look forward to seeing your ongoing [working relationship.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECa1toPGth4)
We want more Herschel!
‚ÄúWhy are you destroying my home?‚Äù
Cute. Oh ‚Ä¶ the seal too.
I would get about three steps on those logs, and I‚Äôd be in the water.
The two of you are cute! üòâ boy that‚Äôs a lot of wood!
[For he goes birling down and down white water ](https://www.nfb.ca/film/log_drivers_waltz/)

What a cutie!
Deforestation üòç habitat destruction üòÇ
Herschel hates deforestation.
 Laying there like. Don‚Äôt I look hot
i'm from vancouver too and i can't get enough of these seal sightings. too cute!!
Sea pupper is good boy
I thought it was super dangerous to walk on logs like that!
Why isn‚Äôt anyone wondering why Herschel is the perfect name for a seal??
Him not willing to move even after a nose chuff probably means there are predators in the area.
Wave
I loved you in The Boys! Those gills are dope!
Cutest coworker ever!!
He waved! How rude of you to not wave back...
Imma ask Hershel for his coworkers digits.
So this is where all those Frogger logs end up
What's with all the logs? Are you making a forest?
**He may be injured**
His Co-Worker reaction was the greatest
That was adorable
How are you walking on the logs and there are no ripples in the water?
Don't worry, he's just sealing the logs.
Your co worker is so cute! You're pretty easy on the eyes too.
So freakin adorable! The seal is cute too.
Must be good lumber. Already has a seal of approval
Is the aww for the seal or the dude? ;)
Is this in the Fraser River in Vancouver?
I can tell this is close to my home in beautiful Vancouver BC ‚ô•Ô∏è
Where is your life jacket?
A dead forest around!
I‚Äôm from Oregon and my grandpa was a logger. I was taught you stay off the logs. Cause if you go under them you‚Äôre not coming back up.
He is cute! Herschel‚Äôs alright too.
 Aww! He waved at you when you walked up to him. Did he ever move, or is he a permanent resident of that log?
Herschel doesn't give a flying fuck! Can we all appreciate the hot guy too here? üî•üíØ
Push his ass in the water.
Hes slapping his belly to scare you off, try and pet him he will bite your fingers off
Is that the booms off Iona Beach?
I didn‚Äôt even know this was still an occupation! Please do an AMA!
AMA please!
Soooo at first glance as the camera first caught glimpse of Herschel, i 110% thought it was a cow stuck in water. It looked like a cows head sticking out the water until my eyes adjusted! Lol. And he was acting all chill about it so i also thought i was on some really fucked up subreddit lolol. Glad Herschel is not a cow stuck in water surrounded by logs...lol fml
Always seal your wood to protect it from water damage.
Soooo... did you seal the deal?
ü•∫I...omeegeerdwhyyoudodis
*starts recording*      
**SNIFF**      
You should hire a video editor or maybe a sound engineer.
He looks lonely you should take him clubbing.
Reddit gave me a free seal coin and then Hershal pops up in the feed! Must be fate. Take my wholesome award Hershal!
This guy is incredibly handsome and the setting doesn‚Äôt help us negate that. Great vid
/r/petthedamnseal
Can I meet you instead?
Seal of approval?
Seal team ready to go
My dog would jump on those logs and chase around all the seals
Gerald finally found a place to bask, he ain't given it up
Herschel's just catching the buss. Gets to go places, doesn't need to swim. He's figured it out.
That's a cute seal, but I'm incredibly disappointed that it wasn't a beaver
/r/sealswithjobs
Seal on a log, what he do tho
So cute! Keeps sayin hi to you
THAT WAS SO CUTE AHAHAH
Ngl, I was expecting a beaver. xD
He's doing great work! He needs a promotion!
Can I pet him?
Hershel is out here on his own, holding it down.
He waves!
Did anyone else see a cow's face for a split second? I was thinking "oh my God! WTF is a cow doing in the water?!" I need to visit my eye doctor.
You kiiiiinda look like Jason Silva. A little.
I thought this was a close up of sourdough baguettes at first. I‚Äôm hungry
Looks like my cat.
Give him a raise immediately! That‚Äôs the kind of energy we need in your company!
i was expecting bubba in overalls. I was not, however, disappointed.
Saw cow, can't unsee.
Probably predators in the water more threatening than your bearded face
Hershel just wanted to say hi and thank
You for your work.
That‚Äôs one cute seal with one good looking man
He's just vibin
Hershel is giving you warning slaps
You guys are both adorable!
Saw logs, expected beaver. Pleasantly surprised.
How‚Äôs the fishing out there?
Is that Steve Crain from house on haunted hill?
/u/vredditshare
Man you best not to be hitting on his wife
My two year old just watched this with me. I said, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs called a seal.‚Äù He said, ‚Äúno, that‚Äôs called a rock.‚Äù
He‚Äôs very handsome. The guy isn‚Äôt bad looking either.
I seriously thought that was a severed pigs head for a few seconds.
Good looking bloke, and a good looking seal. I like this video it's wholesome
Where is this that logs are still being watered? (Used to replace the growing juices with water, makes the wood more durable and pure
Your co-worker is very cute.
Hershel is a good name for a lazy seal.
That wave. Hes like "sup"
Damn I thought it was going to be a beaver
‚ÄòWhat are you waiting for? Come rub my fat belly!‚Äô
He gets my Seal or approval.
What the hell are you doing?
Just so you know not only is the seal adorable but you‚Äôre also really cute!
The Deep strikes again... uncanny.
Plump on a log!
People still log timber like this? I did not know this.
Cute. Thanks for the awwwww!
He waved!
Classic Herschel, Sleeping on the job AGAIN
This exactly what this sub is all about
Thats your sea pupper now
You look like rodrigo santoro
Has anyone ever told you that you speak like a crazy person

but in a good way
Loose seal! Loose seal!
He looks so uncomfortable, trying too hard for the camera :)
Did you just fucking snort at Hershall?
I wasn‚Äôt expecting such a cutie on screen :D the seal‚Äôs alright too ;)
Is he lost?
‚ÄúTom fuck off I‚Äôm busy... üÖÇüÑ∑üÑ∏üÖÉ‚Äù ùô®ùô°ùôñùô•ùô® ùôõùôûùô£
He was playing Frogger(Sealer?) and got bored.
Trailer Park Boys basically thought me how to notice the difference between an American and Canadian accent. I knew almost immediately, for years I couldn't tell
I like him!
He‚Äôs pimp chimpin
Do you know the log drivers waltz?
I love how he waves at you :)  Herschel is darling!
You're rather easy on the eyes too
Just curious, what is your job title? I‚Äôve never seen this before.
the fuck is Bryan Callen doing on these logs anyway
It's not often you see a log boom on reddit! Also, don't let worksafe see you without a vest ;)
Honestly with all the logs was expecting a giant beaver
Totally expected a beaver
He seems lazy.
Hola. You‚Äôre so pretty! I wish I was Hershel! Lol
r/foundtheseal
It does not hurt that you are easy on the eyes either üòÅ
I'll take one. Either one is fine. I promise to love him.
YEAAAA A SEAL
Do you bring him any snacks?
Dunlap?
why'd ye spill yer beans
Seals have abs of steel doing all these planks off little points
Thank god he had the presence of mind to think to take out his phone and record himself!
How beautiful üòò
WATER PUPPY!!!

That little flipper wave is killing me though... you live an awesome life.
superb
And he go birling down and down the white waters
Out of curiosity, where are these logs coming from?
Paint me like one of your French girls.
Hershel looks like a stellar co-worker!!.. Great vid!
That‚Äôs seal-y
His Reddit post about you is funnier.
The stabilization on your camera is insane, I couldn't tell how TF you were traversing the terrain
Why would you want to scare him?  is it dangerous for him to be there?
The way Hersel flaps like yo what‚Äôs up. Yes what do you want. Okay shoo shoo please leave.
I am disappointed that Herschel wasn't a beaver.
I like how it looks like he's actually waving at the camera
Is this just off Wreck beach in Vanc?
I love Hershel, say hi from me next time you see him
Feed him something.


The next day, he'll move.
Do not let him near the dolphins.
Tell me, what's a timber man want with being a seal?
*paint me like one of your French girls*
Wait anyone else thought that was a cow head for a second?
Lazy harp seal has no job
Lazy harp seal has no jacket
isn't that dangerous for him? I keep thinking his soft, squishy body is going to get squashed between a couple of logs.  


And I love how he waves.
Too close to that seal. Flipper slapping is a precursor to aggression. You're lucky you didn't get bit, their bites are nasty.
The Deep from *The Boys*?
*Please let it be a woodchuck*
*please let it be a woodchuck*
*please let it be a woodchuck*

Haaay a seal!
Hershel‚Äôs like ‚Äúgtfo, you‚Äôre fired‚Äù lol what a cutie
I was hoping for beaver, but pleasantly surprised
id be terrified id slip and fall in between the logs then they'd shift and close the gap, sealing me under
Thts so cool to see.
It‚Äôs the waves for me
Something's in the water...
lol
I love how he waves at you
That looks dangerous as hell! What if you fall in the water, can you get up on the logs again? What if the they close while you're in the water? Man, hope you get paid well.
so much sass in those slaps and jiggles.
Dude, he flipped you off.... üòÜ
Were you the voice of Kristofferson in Fantastic Mr Fox?
You are walking over those trees like nothing and also you have baby dragon pet, nice
Didnt know Mariano Di Vaio is a log driver.
That 'wave' greeting is more than I get from my coworkers. With that seal of approval, i wood work there. 10/10
Not sure why but, Jumping across those logs looks like a ton of fun!
So anyways this is Hershel...

Hershel: dude fuck off!
Hey! Dope video, just curious; is log driving still one of the main methods used to transport logs in this day and age or is it subsidary to other means of log transportation? I'm not sure what other means of log transportation there are but this just seems riskier than other potential methods ( like barging or train or semi truck). Very cool stuff though
*flap*

*flap*
Damn Hershel, that's a sassy wave. So cute!
I deem this free award worthy
Damn OP

You‚Äôre a cutie
You fucking nailed it to the log
Hello, Herschel! It‚Äôs nice to have a pal on the job. Helps with productivity log-arithms.
This is why I can never find any dry boards at Lowe's
He wants to learn to step lightly!
My granddad used to do this on the Oregon coast! Those damn boots he wore had giant spikes in them and he had this pike to help guide the logs. Awesome you‚Äôre still doing it!
WHERE THE FUCK IS YOUR LIFEJACKET? 

I used to fish off log booms near gambier island in howe sound BC. ‚ÄòMud sharks‚Äô was our favourite catch.
F L O P
hi
weren't you on mad TV?
That is so awesome.
Brian callen vibes
I love him so much. He‚Äôs a handsome sealy boy
CUTEE
i thought it was a cow
I needed this today
he's watching you to be sure you aren't going to kick him off
I really wanted to see a Beaver but this works too
My god I want to do *this* job
Why are there so many logs in the water?
The Lighthouse vibes
Is it just me or does the seal look drunk
Why do seals always plank lmao that's so 2010
That seal seriously slaps
I want to see how he gets them back in the water
Both of you are so cute üòç
Herschel‚Äôs cute but his coworker is a babe.
Why are the logs soaking?
That log has Herschel‚Äôs seal of approval.
You should post another video of the whole operation... the whole log caravan.... the tugboat etc
Wow handsome!!!!
I was hoping to see Robin Williams
The Deep turned his life around apparently
Vancouver Island? I load those logs onto ships after they run em. Topside, and boomman rated. Edit: I heard you say river, which one?
Herschel be fighting killer whales on the daily. He not scared of Sean.
I wasn't gonna say this, but your co-worker is fat!
I was expecting a beaver lol
I can't stop thinking that this dude looks a hell of a lot like Bdoubleo100.
Aww that is adorable that is the best co worker anyone can have
Guys when are you pick us up. I am ready to come home out.
Awww he waved
Can you tell him I said he‚Äôs cool thanks
Wow a log driver! rare to see you guys nowadays no?.. is this Canada by any chance?
Wow, this is fucked up.
Hi! üëã
Isn't log driving a dead profession?  I thought the laws banned it most everywhere.
I translate his hand flaps as "Shoo human! Shoo! Get out of here."
Stay safe!
He's just playing frogger!
Protect your ankles! I‚Äôve seen some gnarly accidents.  Plenty of Log Drivers here in La Conner, WA. Pray for no mega Hershel i.e. stellar sea lions.  I‚Äôve seen more in The Salish Sea this last year than ever.
That seal looks so confused. Like who the fuck are you dude? What do you want?
Totally cool co worker!!
Seal of approval!
What‚Äôs your job?
This is spectacular.
They way he waves when he sees his buddy :)
You look like The Deep from Amazon's The Boys.
A real log driver.!  The log driver‚Äôs waltz pleases girls completely!

[Log Driver‚Äôs Waltz (National Anthem of Canada)](https://youtu.be/upsZZ2s3xv8)
He is way cute!
Beautiful
You look like Bryan Callen if he had hair
EGG
I thought it was going to be a beaver.
Hershel wants to know where his coffee is and why you interrupted his break.
Awww! Where is this, btw?
Hey, I have that same hoodie! I‚Äôm wearing it right now actually lol
Gonna be honest, I was guessing it would be a beaver üòÖ
No wonder the guy in the vid can't share Hershel he looks too friendly
Am i crazy or did that seal look like a giant pig head at first?
aw he's so cute! is he there everyday??
Human: Morning Herschel

Seal:

Human: *HOOOOOOOOOOOOSH*

Seal:  üëè
This guy gets more ass than a toilet.
Please let it be a beaver, please let it be a beaver, please let it be a beaver...

It‚Äôs a seal
hershel be like ‚Äúoutta here i‚Äôm fucking the dog‚Äù
I'm gonna need to see more of Hershel right now.
‚ÄúMondays, amirite?‚Äù
Was expecting to see Al Pacino chasing Robin Williams in the background
Are you sure this is you? Cause if it is you‚Äôve got one hell of a doppelg√§nger in California named Manny.
Oh damn, my cousin did get a job! I'll have to show his mother.
Wait, people still log drive? Cool.
Shouldn't bother Hershel when he's on his break.
So from what I'm reading.

You got a tug job a long time ago.
Wait, logs are still transported like this?
I would die for hershel
How do I work there?!?!
Hello Ralph
Seals look real cute. Until you see their teeth. And their flippers actually have fucking claws. Yeah, they are def in the Carnivora order.
Whatever you do for a job, it sure beats sitting behind a desk.
You sound like a cop that just pulled somebody over.
Not going to pretend i know what a log driver does but where you are looks rad. Thanks for sharing!
Got wood
This brings to mind a chase scene in the movie ‚Äúinsomnia‚Äù. Really great movie with Robin Williams and Al Pacino. Will not spoil it for you, but watch the movie. Great, underrated movie, and the scene I am alluding to takes your preconceptions upside down.
üòçso,so very nice‚úåÔ∏è
And the animal tooüòç
I was hoping to see Dexter, but your co-worker seems pretty cool too.
The real question is, what kind of breakfast do you eat?
When this started I thought these were crispy hot dogs on a grill
I wanna pet him so bad but I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some reason why that would either be in humane or stress it out
Awwww very adorable!
Pacific Northwest , or farther north, or?
Where is all this fairytale located in a map? ü§©
Herschel waved at you. My dad used to drive logs
Awww, That is so so so sweet of you and him.
damn buddy, thats a hell of a raft
What rolls down stairs, rolls over in pairs, rolls over your neighbors dog? It's great for a snack, it fits in your back. It's log, log log. It's big, it's heavy, it's wood. It's better than bad it's good!
job looks dangerous af
He looks lovely
Seals can be quite vicious! Be careful.
Can I be your buddy?
Special log- permanent seal of approval
This used to be a forest.
lol Herschel is just like, ‚Äúwut?‚Äù
We‚Äôre going to need more videos sir.
What‚Äôs your job anyway
I give him my seal of approval
The only way this could be more Canadian is if OP was carrying a large double-double, eh bud?
Not gonna lie. I was expecting a beaver but I'm not disappointed
Hemlocks...this near a paper mill?
Wait, is he walking on those logs floating in the water? Or is the water just not that deep? Lumberjacks know how to walk on floating logs, but I don‚Äôt know how many others do.
is it just me or did the beginning zoom in of the logs look like rib bones with some meat leftover on them?
\*flap\*
Broo, is that a clockhouse hoodie? I'm wearing the exact same one right now...
He's just like, get all this shit out of my house you deranged tree killer.
Was Insomnia filmed there?
I want to know more about being a log driver. Like how long an far do you drive the logs on a daily basis?
r/nyanners
Yes, just yes
Pet the damn dog
Has anyone ever told you that you look like Frank Turner?
A dogfish
This made my crappy day a million times better, I love u both <3
What a babe

Jackie Treehorn - Log Jammin 2
Man! You look like a skinnier version of Kevin from 'The Office'

(no offence)
thought your coworker was a log at first and was confused
That banana stance tho
Damn, that's the life. Just posted up on a fucking log, slapping your belly. That's the life right there
Why would you wanna scare him. He‚Äôs just chilling on the log. Lol.
He's a cutie, that Herschel. Not much of a talker, is he?
Was really hard to see him at first!
 kind sir... I'm there dumb one here. What kind of trees? Why are they submerged? Is that just water? How long? Is it just because of the type of tree species that needs that done? What are the logs used for?
He has logged a lot of hours there
He's planking!
Fuck loggers
I love Herschel.
Oh my fucking God. I want to pick Hershel up and hold him like a baby. So cuuuute! Lol.
this has my seal of approval
Nice
Hey! I'm not your buddy, friend!
The slaps lol
[Herschel Walker Cuyler them dogs is hell don't they](https://youtu.be/G7RT5M44AVM)
Looks like Fraser River delta between Iona and UBC. Am I right?
So you surf on logs that spin? 

Sounds dangerous, but also kinda fun. Especially with buddies like Hershel.
Your coworker had some hit songs back in the 90‚Äôs.
Looks like the actor who played Gawain in the BBC Merlin series.
Herschel wanted the Internet fame he knows what he‚Äôs doing
he looks like a hershel
Walking on log rafts is terrifying. I grew up (partly) in logging country, and it boggles my mind that the (mostly unemployed, now) loggers are all "blue lives matter" folks. Come on, loggers; your jobs are about a hundred times more dangerous than cop jobs. Holy shit logging is a scary business sometimes.
r/blobswithjobs
How do I get this job?
Figures.... Another one of those of co workers. The kind that are always lyin' around on the job lol.
Quit cutting down the damn forest.
wow
Essential
I wish I had Hirschel‚Äôs intrepid confidence
Why were those trees chopped down?
He kinda cute ngl
Whyd ya spill yer beans tommy?
This has my seal of approval
You look like Tom Ellis hahah.
In case you don't know him, you look good.
*indifferent flap*
He looks like the son in law from last man standing

She has to be feeling so heartbroken.

I just wanna know what you do for a living? You‚Äôre jumping around on a load of logs floating on a lake/sea at sunset with seals? Sounds pretty rad

Love this video! Herschel is super cute, flipping you off like that. I love seeing the tugs go by in the Strait. Hey from Victoria üëã üòä Thanks for sharing!

I love him
Kinda looks like hot janitor from American Vandal
You have a nice face.
If that's on the west coast of Canada I bet there's some orca pack in the area and he's just more afraid of that shit than some hairless monkey thing that can't swim.
Is it just me or does this guy 'need' to be walking on floating timber?
I love how he slaps his tummy in a "come MAKE me" gesture
Well that‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen rewards removed from the mobile preview
Thats me when I say I'll be down in 5 but then my buddies come up to my house just to watch me like that..
