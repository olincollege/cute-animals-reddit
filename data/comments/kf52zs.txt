I can't imagine either of my dogs sitting still long enough for this lol
Boxers are one of my favorite breeds!
Good thing it wasn't a cat scan.
That is frickin precious ♡♡
You've gotta frame that!😀
Great, now the fbi has paw prints to go off next time a frisbee, bone, shoe, etc. goes missing in your area. 

But seriously that’s a keepsake!
Youwannaknowwhat..... that’s what I appreciates about you.
Looooove this, he has no idea what’s happening but just happy to participate in something that makes his human happy
The sweet little face at the end wraps the whole video up in a nice little bow!
I use to have a boxer called mookie thanks for sharing
Doesn't scanning something with the lid up give you a black background and indistinct image?
As was said last time this was posted, the final image is likely a black and white photo from under a glass table. It definitely isn't a copy. (The open space would be black if it was.)
With my luck my dog would sit on the printer and I’d get a picture of his butt hole
Oh, the cute little face while you're holding their paws in place! Adorable!
How precious and clever is this? Boxers!❤️
This came out looking like a professional photograph! What a great idea, and such a sweet dog!❤
“In the clearing stands a Boxer...”

I thought Simon&Garfunkle were singing about a dog when I was a little kid, and that Boxers were a fightin’ breed.
I am impressed by the dog's sense of grave demeanor; obviously he's on-board with the importance of the project.
Awwwww my dog would NEVER 😂
You can tell this isn't a real copy because the light bar isn't even lit up while it's moving. Also the blank space would be black not white, most likely a picture taken under a coffee table or photoshopped afterward to remove all the black, either way good result bad presentation
Do you have the bestest cutest dog ever? I think you do!
Cool idea, I like it!
This is fake.
u/Savevideo
SUCH A GOOD DOG. So calm! Such patience!
*Cues Unchained Melody*
LOOK. AT. THOSE. EYES.
It’s too much.
I wish I would have thought of this before my old pup passed away. This is a neat idea.
Boxers have one of the most entertaining personalities.  Super love able and protective but they are super unique with their expressions and behavior.
This was edited after the scan, right? If I scan a document, and the lid is open, the "air" above the items on the surface is black, not white.
Those blinks! Makes him/her seem like a hooman.
Honestly, I wish I did this with my boxer when I had the chance.
Precious! I'm crying. We just lost our beloved 14-year-old baby boy last week,  and I wish I would have thought to try this before it was too late...
Don't, for even one minute, try and act like boxers aren't the best breed ever.
Oh how I miss my two boxers!
I have never in my life seen a boxer be that still for that long.
My dog's a St Bernard. Not only would our hands and paws not fit, he'd probably break the glass.
Foot fetish on another level.
I want this
What a great idea. I wish I had seen this a couple of weeks ago before my lab passed away. 😣
I had to comment just because I was going to be the 666th comment lmao but this is absolutely precious :)
I'm going to do this tomorrow
The dog is so gentle and patient !!
Ohhh look how good he is ... beautiful photo

I cant even get mine to pose for a "normal" photo
Fuckin weird man.
My boxer would have head-butted me, ran around, jumped and hit me in the balls, then found his favorite bone and disappeared to his bed.
Be still my heart!  How adorable is that.
Love love love this!
If I had an award, I'd give it to you
I will never own another boxer. When my old guy passed away I was so heart broken that I don't think I could ever go through that again. I'd also worry that any new boxer just wouldn't measure up (I know it would because they're amazing) 

Best.. Dog.. Ever.
That. Is. Fucking. Adorable.
Til they die in 8 years, and you stare tirelessly at this photo on the wall. Then you remember that the sun is just going to explode, and that all this bullshit was for no reason
u/downloadbot
That's really cute. The dog reminds me of a gorilla for some reason.
Now do it with your noses!
Is that an ETSU hat?
Attempted this with my cat... I gave up after the 3rd try... squirmy lil bugger. Love the idea of it though!!
just hope they don't eat their limbs
Pa paw prints.
❤️
Precious!
Protip, don't use those plaster hand molds to mold your dog's paw.

Their paws are considerably hairier than your average small child. It's a mess.
Creating special reposts within family
Words cannot describe how much I love this ♥️
Love this so much
My lab would try to eat the scanner.
That is too cute 🥰
Well I know what I’m doing today!
Winsome, just so adorable!
I've never seen a boxer hold still for this long
u/savethisvideo
man's best friend
What a good boy!!!!!!!!! My doggy would never lmao tried to get a print of her paws once with the ones they use for newborns feet but she was not having it lol
u/savevideo
Doing this! Finally that printer I bought for my house has a use.
I want to recreate this with my cat! Cats have the cuties little paw pads like look like little beans
Should be hp envy 6000 series
Fabulous!
That's awesome.  I can't believe you got a boxer to stay that perfectly still, as they are usually so full of adorably goofy energy.  What a very well trained puppy.
Aw I miss my boxer Hazel 😢😢
This is so cute!  And the dog is seriously watching the machine and wondering "What's this machine gonna do, Daddy?"
My Dad was an ER doc when I was young. I remember doing this with him one time when he took me on rounds with him. some 25 years layer, we still have our hands and faces framed and hung up at his house. He stopped working ER when he came home one day after a 24 hour shift and I (maybe 5 years old) was listening to "Cat's In The Cradle" on my mini record player. He has had his own family practice ever since and is much happier.
What an adorable little guy
Ok this so frickin cute
we put our pup down yesterday of 8 years to kidney disease and it was rough on us!! We miss her already!! She went from insanely playful to loosing weight and not eating. It was insane how fast it killed her.. :-(
This is a way better idea than what I did with my boxer, which was buy a little thing of "dog-safe" paint and make prints of his paws. The mess was legendary.
Cute, but what is this title?
Look at that face!!
I wish I could've done this with my honey bunz...
Damn that’s cute.
A scanner with the lid open, I don't know Rick
Omg this is such a good idea. So cute 🥺
Why can't we see light from the scanner, is this a different kind of scanner or the angle?
This is amazing!
I thought it was an expensive nail trimmer and the human put his hands their for emotional support. I need to go to sleep.
as soon as the scanner started to move, my boxer mix would freak out and probably break it lol   


the picture turned out pretty nice tho
Awww. 😍❤️💜💚💙🥰
I wish I had done this with my kid when he was younger. We did the plaster but only twice but this seems easier and more detailed.
What a sweety.
This was much better with the music on tiktok
Cool but don't do that unless you know it's safe, scanners can be dangerous.
Am I the only one that teared up? 🥲
Ok that face is perfection.  I’m in love.
I wish they knew why we did things
Thats pretty cool
This would make a wonderful tattoo
What a good doggy 💗
Wu-tang Wu-Tang
Poor patient dog:  "I have no idea what's going on here, but it seems to be something the human wants to do, guess I'll go along with it ... "
My dog would run around and knock the thing over and break it within a minute guarenteed.
I know a good boye when I see one and that right there...🤏
I have 2 birds. Can only imagine how many attemps until I give up
I so want to try this. My beautiful black Lab is 11 now, and I know I only have a few more years with her. Want one of these to remember her.
Omg this is so sweet, and I’ve never seen a boxer chill enough to pull this off with, lol
And my first thought is, my god, this would use so much ink. Why hasn’t someone invented affordable printer ink yet?!
Aww! I want one of these for me and my pup.
My boxer is the sweetest, most caring dog friend I've ever known.
Yeah this the one
That right there is what you call a punum.
I let out an audible "AWWWWW!!"
How the hell did he get a boxer go be that still??
Cool, but the dog has absolutely no idea what this is.
Hands down the coolest thing I've sèen
So precious
That’s a dog. Get some kids like a real man.
that is beautiful moment with your friend.
My cat would never allow this.
My heart 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺💕💕💕💕
Soooo cute
Tried this with my dog on her last day before we had to put her down. But she was in too much pain. ☹
I can’t imagine trying to do this with my Great Dane.
Now, do the dog’s butt.
Baby 🥰
It's a dog.
Dog is just wondering if they will be snacks after all this nonsense.
That is adorable.
Boxers are wonderful!
I did something similar as a gift to my mom! Only I used black paint and painted the bottom of our lil dog’s paws and pressed her tiny cute feet onto the paper ❤️ she’s a very skittish and fearful dog (even though we have always given her nothing but love) but did really well having her tootsies painted lol
Simmer down with that wholesomeness before I get teary eyed...
The light isn't even on.
That’s awesome
Omg!!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
This is genius I'm going to do to that with my pets
thats awsome, may you send me a pic of that print please, i would like to try something, if you dont might.
The little face at the end 😍

My two dogs would wriggle outta my arms if I tried that with them.
Omg I want this for both of my boxers.
Awww
Nice
Way to go. You just compromised the security of his biometric doggy door.
"what the duck are we doing"
Is that a Boxer? They are so cute and look like they’re always in deep thought mode.
If I tried that with my dog I’d end up with stitches lol
I've never seen a home scanner which doesn't use a light to scan, & I've been in the business long enough to have seen & used plenty.

As someone else pointed out, I'm more likely to believe it's a photo taken through a glass table from underneath.
Boxers are the best dogs on the planet. Once you have a boxer you don't want any other dog
He’s such a good boy
what a neat idea.  :)
As soon as you walk away he’s gonna run back and photocopy his butt.
Aw I bet you’ll paws and look at that a lot
I love that idea! But mine would never figure out what i wanted him to do
THAT IS CUTE
犬：それをファック
So sweet
Years ago I had a boxer and there was never 3 consecutive seconds that dog wasn’t bouncing off the walls.
This has to be photoshop.  That boxer should bouncing around with the strength, energy, and disposition of 10 full grown men on meth.
awww
For the first half of this I thought a brown and white cow was looking on interestedly and I wondered how she would be included.
After my dog dying last christmas of cancer who I'd had since I was about 12, this made me tear up and cry like.i haven't for a while.
Probably the cutest post on this subreddit
I’m not typically an animal person, but this got me right in the feelers.
I’m doing this with my dog first thing tomorrow morning when I get into the office!!
That’s so beautiful
This is ADORABLE 🥰
My friends got a boxer just like that!
Ill trade you my gold fish, a sweet Pokémon card and some pogs for him!!
Dude. That hits
Pets are the best!  They become part of your tribe!   Highly recommend for people not ready to add little humans.
Omg how cute is this 😍
❤🐾❤
That's is great, but we usually do butt
I need to do that
This actually made me say awwwww out loud
I love it!   It is very special.
That brown sugar is a boxer girl, right? :)
Boxers are so awesome!  Thank you for sharing.
*blink*
That’s so sweet
This is so sweet. Has someone been cutting onions in here?
This is beyond perfect!  I want to do this with my girl!
Aww
The dog is wondering "is that food??!"
Good boys!
That’s cute
This makes me so freakin’ happy!
My family surprised me with a photocopy of their hands and our family dog's paw after I left for University. Fourteen years later, it is still framed on my wall. It was such a thoughtful gesture and genuinely helped my homesickness.
Are they good breeds for first time owners?
Boxers are the best. They love kids and all they want to do is work and make you happy.
Love it❤️
Boxers are the best dogs you can ever have, this is a hill I’m willing to die on.
How did you get a boxer to sit like that the entire time!?
Aww that’s beautiful 💋❤️🥰
Boxer are goofs. I've rescued them for twenty years. Each one of them is a different kind of dork that will steal your heart.
I guess you get to enjoy for another 7 years.
Question, if i may: shouldn't the background of the scan be black like in a copy?
Or does a scanner work differently?
Honest question, not trying to be a spoilsport or anything.
Saw this on my insta
Boxers look wierd as hell with tails
I remember when I was younger, I did the same thing with my ass. 🤦🏿‍♂️ kids do dumb stuff bruh
Can you do this with a scanner on a printer?
My dog would be off in a flash
Creative idea. 🐾 What a treasure.  And His face omg😊💙
Exactly as soon as my dog sees the thing moving - “that’s it folks” !   “Oops did I knock you down? “
Like is that his lover????
💜
That's super cute, but was I the only one worried it was going to cut to like a grave with the paw print picture next to it? That would've broken me right away
If you scan with the lid open, the BG's gonna be black.
I love the expression on its face. The dog has no idea what's going on, but knows it's important to human friend, so the dog is in
/u/stee4vendetta this is precious
Is this your  “ finally engaged” or “ we’re expecting “ announcement?
The dog is so patient!  🥰
Gonna try and do the same with my cat, though it's going to be ass prints.
ᔕᗩY ᗯᕼᗩT!!!!!
That is fucking adorable
❤️
Boxers are such great dogs!  Remembering Susie.
Awww that Face ❤️
Id like to see you do this with a cat though
This dog is so confused
U/savethis
So it does have a pause feature
That is one good doggo 🤘
My heart melted at the blink while looking at the result.
my serotonin 📈📈📈
I think I’m banned from aww. But aww.  It worked!
I needd
Beautiful dog
And now we have your finger prints to use as we commit crimes, thanks
He honestly looked interested. Lmao
What a baby!!!
Did that dog really draw that!?
I love boxers sweetest dogs out there
Do you know how many pet parents that just ran to do that?!!!!! I will be doing this tomorrow!
Aww I like that. My Great Dane would go through the glass I’m afraid :(
WHO IS CUTTING ONIONS IN HEREEEEEEEEE?????????
Thanks for the great idea!!
I love this
Thinking about a moment like is really hitting hard , we lost one of our girls last night at 3am
Should have done butts
Wish I did this w my boxer before she passed
The dog face looks so concerned or worried. Lol. “Why are we doing this?”
I loved watching your sweet babe. Being so good. The scan is super. What a great moment to frame up. ❤🤗
I watched this so many times. That handsome pup looks so much like my old best bud. Still miss him every day.
Put my dog down on May 26th this year. Not gonna lie I cried like a baby seeing this post. I hope you guys have many more special years together! Enjoy it!
I instantly thought of the movie Ghost where Demi Moore was making a clay pot with the ghost of Patrick Swayze behind her.
I never knew I needed a scanner until now
Beautiful.
This is too cute! I’ve known a lot of boxers and not many would have ever sat this still. What a sweetie!
The way he BLINKS so cute
BOXERS ❤
Now do the butts...
Pity he couldn't get the hat in also. Most countries have national costumes U.S. have baseball hats.
Anyone know what dog breed that is? Sorry I don’t know the names of most dog breeds, and this one is cute.
I'm a Boxer mom, beautiful dog great project!
Boxers are the best
That’s the most sweetest doggo.
Awwww that is so moving and adorable 🥰
I wish I had thought to do this with my dog :(
Omg that sweet sweet face 🥰🥰🥰
What a good doggie
what kind of dog is this?!  so cute!!
So cute!
Awww that's really sweet. I want one
So cute 🥺

*pulls down pants*
Ohhh, our boxer passed when I was a kid. We all still miss him ❤️
Wow what a sweet moment and you are an amazing dad. ❤
Lame
What a well trained pup
I love this idea!! 💚💜
That is so fantastic! I wish I had something like that from my doggo when he was still around :(
u/savevideo
What a great idea!! I love the end result 😀💯
This is an extraordinarily cute boxer
Ohmyearth, what a good doggy!
End result looks like he's throwing up The Wu
Is it sad that I immediately thought the dog was going to start trying to hold it still, like when they bounce on the vacuum or Roomba?
That face is too precious ;-;
Love this idea
Okay! Now do your butts! Do your butts!
Such a great idea! What a momento. Inclined to do same with my good boy.
Why do I keep getting notis of trending post from this subreddit even though I left?
Boxer would have been terrified by that machine
Now this is the type of wholesomeness I expect from Reddit.
Boxers are so sweeetttt🥺🥺💖
Wish I would have thought of this before we had to put our girl down in October. You'll cherish that forever❤️
thats a dog
Spinster shit
U/savethisvideo
Do your faces next!!
He's so calm which makes him even cuter :D :D
Dude I have like the EXACT same dog! He just doesn’t have that white area on his snout.
Thats not how it works!!!!!
The rest of the area should have been black!
That turned out a billion times better than I assumed.
Hands down this gives me paws.
Aw man, my heart. So sweet
Not gonna lie. It's really cute!
Please 😭🥺🤍
Looooooooove it!!!!!!!!!
In the last post on this people said that machine doesn't work that way.
This is amazing! I think I found my next tattoo! A good black-grey artist can make my little girl a part of me forever!!  Thank you for sharing this!
Cool
I like this post every time I see it!❤️
That’s such a great idea I had to try it with my guinea pig and it turned out really cute but not as good as yours
Awww so sweet
Awww....now I'm teary eyed
Where are the other family members?
Now that’s a good pupper
how bored does one have to be to think of doing this?
This is pogchamp
To bad that dog is ugly as shit
I love Boxers! This is so sweet! ❤
Soooo he humped the dog?
u/savethisvideo
why haven’t we done this?
Every time I print with the screen up it is always black that prints out. How it so crisp and white
What a sweetie!
Thats genius and I'm using it. Thank you.
Omg the dog is so cute just being patient with his paws up there
That’s one to cherish for the rest of your life.
That sweet face just made my cold grinch heart grow four sizes
Boxers are the best breed change my mind
Damn, wish I had done that with my dogs.  I regret never taking enough photos of them in their prime.
I imagine trying to do this with a cat, and all you can get the cat to do is sit on the scanner so you get a nice, perfectly rendered anus.
I love all dogs, but Boxers just have the best faces.
Love his face waiting for the scan - is this over yet?
Omgggggggg the photo at the end!!! Swoon!!!!!
I have 2 boxers and yes they are awesome pets, or family more like it. This is to cute though.
Well, things were going well today. Now I’m ugly crying. This is wonderful and I wish I would have thought of this before my dude passed recently.
Honestly I thought they were doing pottery for a second.
I had 2 Boxers.. how the fuck did you get him or her to sit still with that scanner? Mine were trained well but def not capable of that...
Boxers are the BEST!!
/r/paww
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Weird af
White people do weird shit eh?
Woof-Tang is the greatest!
Balling my eyes out here.  Damn
Congrats you're the weirdest ever owner.
This is fantastic!!!  My big boy would try to eat it.   Probably make a great picture though!
I can’t take how still and adorable he is!
Great idea
Too cool. I'd share it with my wife, but it would make her cry
Love that!
I need to do this. So cute
Oh my God I'm doing this T-T
Such a good boy keeping his hands still
That turned out so cool!
:-)
Omg what a cool idea
u/vredditshare
Fake. 100%. This guy is counting on most redditors having never seen a copier before. Bullshit
Literally one of the worst things I've ever seen. So unbelievably cringey it hurts.
What did you give that boxer to make her so docile?
Aaaand it's post 643896 of someone doing exactly the same thing as the 643895 people before him
