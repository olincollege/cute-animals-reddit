You: “look at my new furry little friend”

Cat: “why am i here?”
Looks like cat isn't aware of this arrangement
I cut ties with my social circle because all of them are on drugs. It's only me and my cat now. Wouldn't last a day without that lil mf, he keeps me straight.

Edit for cat tax, his name is [Bagheera](https://imgur.com/a/r4kNHeS)
I'm seriously considering it too. I've been living alone since last year and well, it can get lonely.
And now you have a human! Good choice.
That looks like delightful company. What an adorable kitty!
Hey dude congrats! Same situation and I’m adopting a kitten TONIGHT!
What a cutie! Just a Lil tip from a cat bro to another: always ground  a cat when lifting (hold his paws on your arms/back). They usually get nervous and scratch w/e is in front of them when they cant feel something beneath their paws. This should save your skin! Also, keep a water fountain to prevent urinary illness (I lost a cat this way before and its quite Common to overlook this detail. Enjoy your furry friend!
Get 2 so they can keep each other company when you are not there. 

At work, not dead
Who took the picture?
Adorable floof! Make sure you support the hind legs. The "Simba" position is not at all comfortable for cats.  What a cutie, though :)
Congratulations! Just a tip. Always support the kitty’s hindquarters. Her legs shouldn’t dangle like that. Hold her like a baby (in the crook of your arm). 😊
An excellent choice. Nothing better than a fuzzy roomie, kitty will make sure you smile every day.
Consider getting a second one, I noticed our cat was very lonely during the day while me and my girlfriend were out at work for 8-10 hours a day so we got him a buddy around the same age. 

There were times where we could hear him howling at the door after we left because he didnt want to be left alone.
This is such a wholesome picture 🥺
That cat is the 2nd cutest cat I've ever seen (behind my cat).
Real talk, my only goal is to be able to afford my own apartment and live with my pet.

I’d rather die than have roommates.
Best friend forever.
Adam Driver is quaking
Artour Babevskiiss?
It's always good to see when an independent cat adopts a human.
[Heyyyyyyyyyyyy Kirby. Whatcha doin Kirby. Why’d you eat that leaf](https://youtu.be/7T_KKiQiolk)
Get him a lil bro so he wont be alone all day while ur gone
Please, don't keep her single. Almost all cats need feline companions.
What a happy hooman and a cute kitty
Man you look hella happy
A very fine choice! I would get a cat I a heartbeat if I could...
You’re as adorable as the cat
Adorable company you got! Everything will be more meaningful now :)
Which one are you?
Nice duo you guys make! Keep him/her safe or diseases by keeping him/her indoors all at the time and enjoy his/her company.

source: Me, a guy who never wanted to have a cat and thanks to my wife now I love our Zara.
Well as soon as that dude puts you down you can go get a cool fish or something.
\•3•/
Getting a kitty was the best decision I’ve ever made.  Little guy probably saved my life.
Fuckin ghosts taking your picture?
Purrfect :)
He's fucking perfect
That is the best kind of company:)
Meow
Now that is a winner!💯
Good choice!
Looks like a great choice for company
you both deserve cuddles!
That cat is beautiful
Super cute shnuggle-bellied tyke!
That’s a fuckin’ nice kitty right there
Awwww so cuteeeeee 😍😍
Her paw makes it look like shes bopping your nose
Aww
Good choice!
r/kittenbellies
Call it company, call it emperor or lord, even enslaver or just call it pspspspsps.
Handsome sir
That's the best roommate ever 🤗😁😎.
How did the cat type and post this?
Coddle him like a baby and give him belly rubs from the first day. Make it seem normal and over time you will be greeted with a request for belly rubs and get to pet the softest fur ever!
Be good to your kitty!
I'm happy you found a human little kitty
Congrats on being adopted!🎉
Best company ever. Congrats to the both if you!!!!!!
You found a cameraman! Congrats, hope they help keep ya company!
Just wait until they pee on your bed three days in a row

Source: just adopted kittens and they have peed on my bed three days in a row. Fortunately they're cute as fuck and I love them, but someone pls send help
Ummm who's taking the pic
If it’s just you and your new furry friend, who took the photo
Awww, I'm glad for you. Now you get to see all the details of your life through new eyes, and suddenly little things are irresistibly exciting, strangely horrifying! Like taking a shower or running the vacuum cleaner.  


My kitten brought me so much joy and lifted me out of a depression. He stalked me every time I sat down on the toilet and turned it into an adventure. A year later I got another stray kitten, and she perched on a stool in the kitchen and carefully smelled each and every item I brought home from the grocery store.
Is this your imgur account? Saw this same post there yesterday https://imgur.com/gallery/SqT6mmW
So who took the pic? 🤔
Yeah i know a cat does need some company so why not buy a human? Best way to keep company and not be lonely
Prepare to have everything destroyed
Then who took the photo? 

Next up on Mysteries Unsolved..
I dont believe you...who took the picture then?
Awwww! You two are eyebleach! Internet hugs for you cuties!
You'll fucking hate him soon.

But you'll love him much more.
Awwe you both are adorable!
[deleted]
Super cute ! But one thing,  who took the photo , when you were living alone ? Maby a friend of yours or was it a killer ? *whispering* do you need help ?
By yourself? Who took the photo!?!
I always told my husband we would never get a cat. I gave in when rescued a kitten that was stuck in the engine of my moms car. Love. At. First. Sight. Now we have 2 cats that hate us lol
Whose taking the picture then..? Anyway nice cat wish I could get one but I live with my parents so ...💀
You both look great!
Cute!!!!
You are in store for some GOOD TIMES!
I am feeling that myself
I'm sure the cat will feel the love.
Who took the picture
ZOMG, what a cutems!!
You won’t regret it. They’re cute and sweet and fun!
If you live alone then who took the picture ?
Dk whos cuter, the dude or the cute, no homo tho
How nice of you to adopt a human being!
Dude that looks exactly like a rescue my family owns did you get him/her in the Lehigh valley?
Both are super cute
Awww
Does no one know that there are self-timers on phones?
Awe, you adopted a human. Good kitty.
...... who took the picture???
who took the picture then
Hmm, if you're living by yourself, who took the photo?🤔
What a cutie
You've chosen your new master wisely
You're cute! And so is your human!
Him: I live alone

The ghost taking the picture: am I joke to you?
If you live in the right kinda place, let you little fella go outside with you. If he tries exploring, don't follow him. Just wait patiently with some food. It's risky but the benefits of having an indoor/outdoor cat are amazing. My buddy stays outside when I'm at work and basically becomes the "neighborhood" cat until I come back. He's always waiting for me when I return, ready for dinner and keeps me company as I rest up for the next day. Outdoor cats live longer too!
Due to a recent excellent choice to add some floof to your household, I now bless you with the following: 

You will laugh more and more frequently than ever before

you will love deeper than you ever thought is possible

you will become blind to scratched furniture, because you will only see how happy your cat makes you

you will wake up screaming from needles in your feet - do not worry, your kitten is just practicing hunting moving objects hidden under whatever covers

you will realize that you are happy to be a 100% owned by a cat, and to serve and make the cat happy, will now make you happy

Enjoy your baby!
Then who took the picture?
Ah so you bought a human
Won’t find a Better Companion ! Congratulations to you Both 🙌🏼🙌🏼
Nothing will take up your time like a kitten. A dog will often sleep from boredom next to you. A cat will make sure you are paying attention until it falls asleep lol. If you are on a keyboard alot, get a distraction keyboard.
You are a cute couple!
Are they a boy kitty or a girl kitty?
Il est cuit
Meow!
And the cat is like "welp, this is my life now".
Your cat let you pick it up straight away? That's love
the company looks uneasy lol
Awww
Who took this picture? You think I can be fooled so easily?!11!
Best friend you could have! ✨😸💗✨ Good for you being strong and making your life better.
What a cute, inquisitive-looking little monster! Congratulations, cats are terrible people but good company
Ahhh good choice. You bought a Human
That’s some cute company you got there
#CONGRATULATIONS!!!
So sweet!!
#CONGRATULATIONS!!!
Thread title is the words of the dude or the cat?
Seeing a cat being loved always brings a smile to my face.
Animals are the best, you always know where you stand with them.
But if you live by yourself, who took the picture 0-0
Awww that's the best company!!
Adorable company!
thats a nice lookin kitty ya got there
Can you even imagine this comment section if OP was a woman.
Tour have really nice eyes! The cat is cute too. I hope you’ll be happy together. 😁
You've got a best friend in the making! Smart choice. If you can get a second one. Cats love having a partner in crime :)
Stick with the cat... You won't go wrong!
Wait then who took the picture
You win!
What is their naaaame?? Love their little white front toes!
Longcat in the making.
i would like a update in couple months.  ;D and awesome new friend.
What’s the cat’s name ????
AWWWWW
Catsssssssssssssss are the besssssssssssssssssssssssssst.
Ahh a single king that needs some cat company. I can relate. You dropped this 👑
You did good!
so you decided to move in with a human? good kitty, got yourself a food slave for life!
Good on you, mate
So cute!
Wholesome Company. Approved. =)
All I imaged was https://youtu.be/fNFzfwLM72c when I saw that cat
Da face is perfect company
If it's only you and the cat....who took the pic?
Then who took the picture???
Cute
Does anyone know what breed it is?
Aww, you have a handsome new bff! Wishing you many years of enjoyment!
If you're living alone, then who took the picture? Hmmmmmmm
If you photoshopped out your hands, he could totally be doing a Frankenstein zombie walk! "BRAINS...I mean, meow!"
"You chose wisely" 

Congrats! What a cutie and I hope the two of you have many happy years!
Good for you! I'm a single guy who prefers dogs but adopted a cat last year because of how much easier they are to take care of. I had an opportunity to move and restart my life in a new career in Alaska just before Covid hit. No way I was leaving my guy behind. I carried him on the plane with me and I'm so glad he's here with me. With the Covid issue, being social has been a bit difficult in a place i have never lived before. Having my guy waiting for me when I get home has been a way to ease into the transition. Congrats on your adoption, OP!
This picture made me grin. Thank you, and enjoy your new friend!
So adorable!
Nice human you got there. But remember to feed him and get him enough time outside.
Those kitten eyes are adorable. Enjoy the little fur ball. My 2 cats keep things exciting at my house. They follow me throughout the house like dogs, are trouble makers and take most of the bed space. Cheers, enjoy the company.
he/she looks like great company :)
The best kind of company
So you got yourself a human?

aw I did the same thing recently too!! adorable kitty, I hope he’s not too bad of a roommate lol
You chose.... wisely.
You look happy and relaxed. You've made a good choice.
You both look great!
Likkle BABYYY🥺🥺

So precious
Well done and a wise choice man.

The only drugs you now need to buy is catnip
Awesome choice, beautiful kitty.
A cat is fine too.
If you want to give him/her milk, use long-life milk from the non-refrigerated section.  Low lactose, much better for them, and way cheaper than 'cat milk' which is essentially the same thing
You keep some very cute fuzzy company
Such a good choice, friend! That cat is best friend worthy.
You got a hoomans! Hope he's is house trained.
So adorable

r/MenSmittenWithKittens
Then who photographed you?
Awwwww, look at that cute catface 🥰
who took the photo?
So you got yourself a human servant, hm? Smart cat
They're adorable!

A couple years ago I was living with my ex. She cheated on me and we broke up. I was living almost two hours from my family and most of my friends so I didn't have anyone to hang out with or talk to.

If it weren't for my kitten I don't think I would have survived. It's lonely living alone and pretty depressing. Without him things may have turned out differently. 

If someone lives alone and can physically own a pet they should. Especially a cat since they are super low maintenance and incredibly affectionate.
You look like a cool person!
And your cat looks like a cool mf 👌
Who is this human and why does he small like loneliness?

-cat
Big cute
Love it!
Who took the photo? Lol jk
Nice cat. Living alone doesn't have to be lonely. A cat is a nice companion.
Seriously cats really do help. I have my kitty now, although she’s a dumbass for getting sprayed by a skunk which resulted in like a week of agonizing “I can’t cuddle her tight” moment as she smells like the inside of someone’s asshole lolol she still smells but it’s slllooowwwwyyy going away
excellent choice!
Pets are better than people ANY day.
Idk man, your new roommate looks like kind of a bad seed. Troublemaker written all over that cat. Best sleep with an eye open for a while
What a cute company
Seriously wanna get a cat, but scared I won’t take care of it properly 😭
YAY! So sweet!
You look so nice. I love your cat.
Oh my gosh!! So cute!!
You have a very nice smile.
same here. hahaha fill my schedule with all her stuff.
Didn't hold him up high enough. Can't sing the song now.
Looks like you chose WISELY, Luke Skywalker... 💖
Who took the pic
Awesome! If you can swing it, get one more. They will keep each other company when you are away and their shenanigans will constantly entertain you.

Congrats! After a breakup, I've been considering a kitteh. I hope you two are happy for years to come!
Who took the photo
Best company ever.

Gratz!
I also have gotten myself a new human slave. They are so fun!
Well it looks like you're in good company now :)
Sooo cute!!
Ah man great choice. Living alone is already the best, but to combat existential loneliness, a pet is the go-to. Wish you both a happy life
Cheaper than a human.  Cuddles better, too.
I have wanted a cat for a while now, but I know my roommate does not want any pets around.  Maybe one day.
I learned you can't cuddle a goldfish. I got mine 9 years ago.
Lmao
Pls halp
I recently got a lil kitty too! Its kinda the best
Mmmmm cat stew.
Give me a hot intelligent and kind girl or a cute kitten and the kitten wins every time.

I'm not even joking.

I have toxoplasmosis, I swear.
I got a full sized fella that looks like yours!
Wait.....who took the picture then?
"So I got a human"
But can I see the beans?
Are you going to film lots of videos in Slo Mo with her?
Don't forget to support the back feets!
Duuuuude cats are awesome you guys are going to have a lot of fun
Proud of you, kitty!
WHISKERS!!!!
Enjoy! You guys will bring each other much happiness xo
What a beatiful picture.
*gasps* then who took the picture, unless he used a timer, but who has a tripod for their phone?
Who took the photo? 😝
Doesn’t look like you lived by yourself. I see plenty of mosquito roomates.
Both Look pretty
I wanted to get a pet rat but my landlord wouldn’t allow it
If you’re by yourself then who took the picture 🤔
Looks like the Lion King scene. So cute!!
Who took the photo?
BEST COMPANY 🙌 I got Five, it's a party every day
So I got this hooman!
Then who took the picture?! Hah, caught you!
So who took the picture? :o 


Just kidding, but yay!!! Love the kitty!!! :3
Two very happy souls
That is one fuckin nice kitty
now make it incredibly obese and give it terminal health problems so you can get that r/chonkers karma
Then whose holding the phone
then who took the picture
 Adorbs all around. 😊
Did a ghost snap the pic???
Single dad here. Was pet free for a year after my divorce. Getting my cats was the best decision I've made after that year was up.

Congrats!
*fifteen years takin' prescriptions*  
*now a shrink like, "ionno, maybe get a kitten*
Congratulations cat! Your new human looks like a lot of fun! Look at that smile! Now, is he potty trained? Some of them can take a while to learn. Be patient. May you enjoy many years together
Who took the picture???
That kitten is going to be a big ass cat lol
Off brand RTZ?
I live alone but my depression keeps me more than enough company
Tummy, tummy, tummy!
so cute :)
who took the picture then....
Get him a sibling if you have the room. Kitten's like playing with other kitties.
You look so content! I hope you two have many snuggles together!
Ah, welcome to servitude, my friend! We've been waiting for you. 

Best wishes to you and your new deity.
What a precious little mafk
So you got adopted by a nice cat? That’s cool dude.
Did the same thing. Moved into my first apartment with my S/O but we both worked completely different schedules and would get lonely on my days off... Ended up adopting a cat and being the happiest I've ever been.
That’s the best company
start playing world of warcraft :) ill be ur friend too
I thought the cat wrote the headline when I read it the first time.
Which one are you op?
r/Mensmittenwithkittens
Cute cat!
Omg what a cutie! That goes for both of you! 😊👍✨
Um, you mean the cat needed company. You are new pet of an adorable car. Congrats on finding and owner
I’m kind of the same boat living by myself but have yet to get a dog. No one would be home to give it attention so I’m not sure if I should get one.
Holy fucking cutie patootie
What a delightful friend you have made. Cheers!
Cute tummy. The cat.
What a dear little fluff! And you look so happy!

If you can afford the adoption fee, I'd recommend getting a second kitty too. The food and vaccination bills are higher, but overall they are less trouble than one -- having a pair lets them be cuddle buddies, play mates and adventure friends together rather than needing all of that from you alone. Also it's even cuter and funnier!
Cute
Who took the picture? But nice cat.
Adorable little terror
So you went out and got yourself a human????
So you got a cameraman, good job!
Good company now 👏🤗👏
Good company now 👏🤗👏
Oh yeah? If you are living by yourself, then who took that picture? Huh?!?
The baby
Best choice you ever made dude!
Years of joy! Adorable kitten! Congrats!
Excellent choice!!
Wait....then who took the picture!??!?
Beautiful and adorable ❤️
oh my God i really like this cat so cute and u too
Of course why not
As a tip, try to get them fixed as soon as possible. They can develop some very annoying habits and even get to be assholes if they don't get fixed while young. You should ask around and see what local places offer cheap fixing because some bets charge 150-300 when some local places will do it for 45 if you find the right place
"But he days of the Killer Cars were numbered... thanks to the miracle of atomic mutation... but at what cost?
Holy shit, everyone, a cat is posting on Reddit!
I recommend listening to the song 'Kirby' by Aesop Rock. It's a funny but touching take on how getting a cat altered his mood better than any drug or therapy etc....well, that's my take on it anyways
Cute cat, but its eyes are like "WTF?" while its paws are like "whats gravity about again?"
Wait...if you're living by yourself who is taking the picture?
They are the best company right now. I'm sitting with my sweet girl of 18 yrs. I live in SFBay area & it's so dark outside lights are on, skys of dark from fires all across the state. Late in the night I followed the fire near my sister in beautiful OR, a place I love. My sweet girl is my only solace right now.
So cute!
Then who took the picture...
Unhand me Yankee!
Great choice!!
You should get one more so your baby has a kitty friend!
That’s a great pic

Dude that cat gives you such an adorable huge shit eating grin.  You look so proud to be chosen by that lovely feline.
Arteezy?
This will be me in one or two years
I did the same thing, but I got 2 little critters.
I have the same pants :)
Abyssinian or bengal if you had to choose? I can't decide which I want.
I love this lil’guy/gal. I had one that looked just like him/her with the white markings on his nose. He( RuRu)was the best cat ever! I cried when I saw this picture.
The BEST company
Such a little cutie.
That is a good looking kitty cat! Girl or boy? What is it's name?
So you picked up a human. Well played my feline friend.
Congrats! I was struggling these past few months living alone and got a cat on Friday. Doing way better 😊
If it's an indoor cat, make it used to a harness and leash early on and train to go out. No walkies like with a dog but let it discover and walk you. I missed it with mine and now it's impossible to make him used to it.
So yiu got a pet human.excellent .
You can already tell from him, he didn't mind the picking up for a picture. That's a good kitty.
So you adopted a human?
awwww get another one so they're not alone when you leave!
Outstanding, Private!! (in me best Lee Ermy voice).
Why you both low key look like each other
Aw you look so happy, this is just wholesome🥺☺️!
I love how happy you look
Adorable cat!
Reddit loves cats
Beautiful company.
Don’t worry now you’ll get a gf in no time
the smile says it all 🥺
I love this, Y’all both look so happy. What’s his name?
Congratulations! I just got my cat today 😻
It's all scritches and belly rubs until the little dude goes full sprinter at 3 AM.
Are you the cat?
🥰 awww he so adorable my cat use to be like the when I first got him
He’s like MEH?
So you got a human?
Six cats here. Best choices ever.
So you got a human? You could have done so much better!
Adorable
Wait...if you're living by yourself. Who took the photo!
Should have got a dog.
When my sister started living on her own, she struggled with loneliness. I kept telling her to get a cat because I know how life changing they are (I have two lil idiots). After her last bout of depression a couple years ago, she finally took my advice and got a cat and she's never been all that lonely since with lil Avery Bradley.
Goodness you two are the cutest things I’ve seen today
Well, you'll never be alone now!
GOD DANG KUTEE
Cats def help fend off toxic people. Not long after my best friend of 17 years passed away (who also happens to be a cat), I had some of the worst people invade my life with their bullshit. It was terrible!
Wonderful choice.
Such a cute baby 🍼
Fuckin cutie there, mate! Cute lil kitty too
Jealous...
So you got a notoriously standoffish animal?
Nice meower you have there. Congrats!

Good luck

A+ kitty. Super cute.
I like your facial hair

I got my kitten a couple months ago - already can’t imagine life without him!! Congrats on your new friend, you’re gonna have such a good time :))
Congrats! Kittens are sooo much easier than puppies and just as fun and loving.

If you find that your kitten isn't as cuddly as you want, just ignore it for a while and pretend you don't care, it will become cuddly again in no time.
Congrats!! Get ready for plenty of cuddle sessions. Tip from a cat owner: if you can afford it, try to steer clear of feeding him dry food. Cats are carnivores and need a healthy protein diet. Dry food is like 99% carbs. I’m so happy for you and your new companion!! What’s his/her name?
Oh yes
That’s good company!
Love him! You are changed forever! ❤️ congratulations!
Keanu?!?
Adorable but you don't hold a cat that way. There are  more caring considerate forms of holding all animals.
Men with cats are super sexy!
Adorable!!
Hello fellow cat person!!! Your little ball of fluff will bring you so much joy and you will bring your little friend so much joy, too!
Get another one hehe
So you got a hooman? Niiiice
Congratulations on being a cat dad!
awe so cute and kitty kisses are the best
Who took the picture ?
Then... who took the picture?!?
You look so happy!
Next episode : we were living by ourselves, but he needed some company.
Can't believe you let your roommate hold you like that.
Amazing decision
I think you meant shitting* instead of living
Could have just bought some stock, this works too i guess
If you live by yourself, then who took the photo?
Pss pss pss my friend.
Can’t go wrong with a lil Tabby.
He looks like a little dork! <3
Ohhhh, so sweet. You did a wonderful thing for both of you. Be happy. ☺
Hi OP, 

For a cat you type very well.. congrats on your new human.  

Stay liquid.
Cute cat.  Amazing woodwork.
Boots shall be his/her name no 🧢
Oh God it's funny how this showed up for me. I've been VERY unlucky about getting a cat lately and to be honest I don't think I'm getting one ever. So it basically started where I found a cat in a pet shelter that I really liked. I showed it to my parents and we talked and had a discussion for a bit and decided to fill out the adoption form. It was going well until they asked us for our landlord phone number. My parents made a big deal about it and canceled the adoption. I just don't understand. Then I found another cat a day later and they agreed. Unfortunately the cat was actually in another state but to my guesses was adopted already. Then the NEXT day I came across once again, another that I liked. I sent an email and the next day they asked us to them. We did, and the cat was available and can be adopted. My parents agreed to get the cat in two days. So it's been three days so far. Then next morning, we were sent an adoption application for the cat, then it said we had to pay something like 1,000 dollars of anything goes wrong. Great. Now getting this THIRD cat wasn't possible anymore. My parents then said there were more cats at a cat shelter and we could visit them the next day. Later my dad said he could make time to see the cats the same day. Of course, I was excited, but then some guy made us wait too long at this car repairing place we had to bring the car to and now visiting the cats was moved back to the next day. THEN AGAIN my sister was upset that she couldn't come with me because she wanted to see the cats which caused an argument which then included our mom. My sister brought up something that happened like a week ago and now my mom is saying that she is true and that I'm going to wait to visit the shelter until later. So it's been like a week of unsuccessful searching for a cat and now I'm basically banned from doing it for a while. Man, you're so lucky...
Awh...congrats to both of you! Life is good😊
WHO TOOK THE PICTURE?!
Congratulations on your new human, kitty
Plot - who took the picture?
Ah.. A personal goblin. You have good taste.
Good choice.

Great company 👌
You got the BEST company!!
She’s beautiful.

Get a second one, cats and most pets need to have another of their kind in a household. Some countries require it
Best decision ever
Who took the picture then if he lives alone?
Liiieeesss who took the picture, hmm??? ok 👍
Aww that's great OP. What a cute cat!
That’s a great friend ❤️
Bro, I rescued my cat a few years back and it was the best decision I’ve ever made. We are extremely affectionate with each other, it’s a beautiful thing
Huh. I usually just eat those things.
Congratulations.  I live with family, one of whom has said that if it was me and him, there wouldn't be any pets.  Well, that's the hill that I would die on.  There will always be a cat or a dog or some other pet in any place that I lay my hat.  They add so much to your life, and they require some effort and care from you, but they are more than worth it.  I am a cat person (I volunteered at an animal rescue that specialized in cats and kittens), so you have my extra, special, double-plus thank you for giving this beautiful animal a good home.  Happy trails to the both of you.
What a cute friend
That's a friend.  
You need two.  
  
Twos company.
WAY better than any obnoxious human!
Cute guy + cute cat = win
You got a human! That’s great, OP. They’ll keep you company.
Thank God you got a human. It's hard to meow at everything when there no one there to listen.
Such a cutie!!
Congrats on your adoption
this post will have a cursed comment. I just know it.
Now she's gonna need company
So you buy a cat? The animal that doesnt like being touched unless it wants to and will walk walk away from you, do what they want(annoying), and knock your stuff over.
They got you too!!!!

I'm sorry. perhaps there's still time for you......

Don't trust her at all. Don't trust cats ever!! I'd say run but I suspect it's too late. That's how they get you. 

If you can though, run away, run as far away as you can before it's too late!!

Heed my words before you're their slave!!!!!

Don't say you weren't warned! 

sigh, I know it's too late. As soon as you saw her you were doomed. DOOMED. 

I too now have a cat master. I didn't mean for it to happen but it did. grrrr

stupid fluffy cute things that make you do stuff........ Grrrrr. I wish you the best with you new evil fluff ball! :)

(sarcasm for those who are concerned)
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
Awww you guys are gonna be the best of friends ♥️
*But who is taking the picture?* 😳
Congratulations to both of you!
Awwww....now you're not alone anymore! Enjoy your new roomie!
RTZ ?
How nice. You went out and got a human!
If you always make sure the back paws are supported while holding, your cat will be much happier
If you're by yourself, who's taking the picture?
I would love a cat myself so much but just don't have the time for the responsibility now
Who took the photo?
Not to be shallow but I love your laughter lines and dimples. You look happy
Beautiful! The best company!
I kitty'd out loud
Your baby is so beautiful! I love the white stripe between the eyes and nose. The toes are pretty colored too.
And you got a life long friend. Congrats, dude! I wish you the best!
Best company ever. Unconditional love is priceless.
It looks like is the only 😺😺😺😺on Homie life lmao 😂
What a wonderful couple of roommates☺️
Are you the cat?
Nice  cat
Cute cat, but if you were living on your own who took the picture?
Wait who took the picture (not sur if some said this already)
If you live by yourself, who was taking the picture
Im sure you and that lil nugget will have a great time
Im glad you have some company now!
I got a cat when I started school because I was worried about being alone and having no friends. Did fine socially, but 8 years later he is still my best friend. Cat affection is feels so genuine and earned, like they absolute are *your* little buddy. Good call
Cute couple
Ok lizard boy
So who took the picture?
If you live alone, who took the picture?
FUCKING AWESOME ! BEST MOVE EVEH
You are hooked,congrats.
The very best of companions
[deleted]
That is some **seriously** adorable company, you lucky son of a gun.
Aw she's a cutie! Give her lots of love! 💕💗
Look at these cuties 🥰
Then who took the picture
You should have gotten two so they can keep each other company when you’re not around.
Boop
If you’re living by yourself then who took the photo?
If you live by yourself, how did you snap that picture??
That's an extremely cute cat. Congratulations.
You are so cute
Who took the photo then? Hmm?
Who took the photo then?
Good for you, you look so happy!
I like to imagine that the cat wrote this post.
That’s the best company there is. 😊
Who took the photo of you where living by your self
Congrats, good man and little buddy!
I SEE YOU GOT YOURSELF A HUMAN. A VERY WISE DECISION. THEY LOVE TO DOTE ON YOU AND GIVE YOU LOTS OF TREATS AND PATS WHENEVER YOU WANT.
Liar, who took the picture?
Nice human, man
So... who took the picture?
Who took the picture
Name?
I’m not a cat fan but I am happy for you! We all need company!!
Cute kitten.
🥺🥺
Glad the cat found someone to keep him company
what ghost took the photo tho ?
didnt know rtz have a kitten
Hell yeah. I know the feeling. I adopted a 3.5yo cat about 4 months ago. One of the best things I ve done.
You have chosen wisely.
So cute! Cats make the best roomies! You’ll never be alone!
:)
That is a cute guy you allowed in your home.
Puuurfect
Pet that cat while it's eating to socialize it and it will love you forever
Who took the photo?
That cat’s face looks so silly!
Who took the pic then? Lol
if you were living by yourself... then... who took the picture? :0
I literally wept for this man.
Aww, your new human looks cute!
Omg who took the picture!!!
Who took the picture?
haaaa cute! Both of you
Best roommate anyone can ask for. So cute.
You called out into the night, and the night answered back.
Best decision of your life.
Such a cute kitty! \^w\^
You have the nicest smile.  The kitten looks a bit startled but your smile speaks for both of you.
Awww, two cuties.  You will adore each other in no time.
"Say hello to l'il friend." (reference "Scarface," Al Pacino)
You made a PERFECT choice! Cats are perfect antidote to loneliness. 

I can't tell who is cuter though...
CAT PILATES

1. Lifting your cat at least 10x/day, to put it out of the way.

2. Vacuuming every week, as opposed to annually.

3. Bending over at least 10x/day to pick furballs from the carpeting

4. Squirming: The exercise that you have to do when your cat sleeps with you--worming your way out of bed, trying to end up on the right side of the bed to get up--without waking kitty or peeing your pants.

5. Holding in your stomach so that you can squeeze through a 12" opening in the patio door **If you have a patio pet door**
Slow introductions to baths. Also, why is it that you look way too familiar?!
I'm not entirely sure if this post was written by the dude or the kitten.
Good move to buy a kitty.  Love her with all your heart.
Beautiful!   Thank you for giving that little fur baby a forever loving home!  Bless you both!
I need something like this.... been living alone in a new state for 4 months. Made zero friends cause college is online. But I'm super allergic to dogs and cats
Okey but who took the picture 🤔
I can tell🤥
Does the ghost that took the picture approve?
Best kind of company
Hes a cutie!
YAAAAAAAAY! 😍😍😍
Confirmed: Picture was taken by a ghost.
I moved to a different country for school, so I don't really see my friends anymore. I'm so happy I was able to take my best friend with me tho! You're never alone when there's a fluffball breaking something in your house
A house is never complete without a pet
Get a second cat too. Cats dont do well alone. Especially, of they are indoor cats. Then you should really get a second one. Would be a shame to see that cute fluff ball be sad
You got yourself a cutie.😺😸❤️💕
Good decision.
If you live alone, who took the picture 🤔
Good for you mr cat glad you found some company
Congratulations! Cats are endlessly rewarding.
Two handsome dudes!
So...who took the picture?
So who took the photo? :D
Thats one adorable little kitten. Above average.
Is it pregnant then ?
The new alarm clock is super cute!
Who took the picture?
So cute! I hope the furry one and you have long, happy, healthy time together!
The best companion you could get. 🐈
Excellent choice. We all approve
Adorable company!
Look at these cuties! BFFs in the making.
Beautiful!
I live alone and desperately want a cat. But my landlord won't let me and I don't know what to do. It gets worse the longer I go. Wish I had a furry friend...
Sometimes you just need someone you can meow at from across the house!
This is my current life goal, to have a place where I can have a kitten.
Omg isn’t that baby cute!!
👍
So you bought a duck?
CUTE BABY
Dont do it...
I have a white-stripe cat like that! He's such a goober, we love him so much.

We named ours Luke since his white strip on his face looks like a light saber.
Who took the pic?
Wait if you live alone who took the picture?
Who took the photo🤔
That’s not company. That’s trouble!
You have chosen well.
Best roommate ❤
I plan on getting a cat after I move.  I'd honestly rather have a dog, but i won't have the time dedicated to care for one.  Cats are easier.
A smol fiter
Find a way to hold him that hes comfortable and doesn't fidget too much. I've had a kitten for 6 months and he wont let my brother hold him because he doesn't do it right.
Then who took the photo?!
Get him a playmate. Seriously. Best thing ever to have more than one! I'd go same age-ish if you can. I mean if you're going to clean a litter box and put food out... two is no more work than one.
Upvoted the cat
What a innocent face for this picture. I’m very jealous
Please don't abandon the furbaby once the lockdown is lifted or you expand your social circle.

Losing a loving owner is traumatic for a pet.
The cutest little freeloader
What a beauty!  Good for you. ♥️
So many awards!
Holy shit man, he's adorable!
bro you look 14 and 24 at the same time
Who took the photo then?!?!
The best company! Absolutely
Welcome to having a cat
Who took the picture then
Nice!
Who's holding the camera? LiAr.
