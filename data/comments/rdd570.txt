I work with kids in the care system and this post has made me incredibly happy :-)
I love this!  The eye roll is fantastic, what a wonderful family!
Respect to anyone adopting a teenager! Never happened to me and spent most of my life through the system. So nice to see people out there who don’t jus want a baby.
I’m adopting a 14 year old girl, and I love these photos SO much!!! 

Now thinking that we’re going to have to incorporate and eye roll photo too. She’s already practicing every day, so we’ll have it down to an art once it’s time to finalize!
The pic of teen and mom is especially cute. So much joy and security and love! And those teeny tiny little sneakers 🥺
This is amazing. Made me smile!
This is probably the only reveal party I think is awesome!
Your family looks like you love each other a lot! Congratulations!
Not only is this incredibly adorable, I appreciate the hell outta y'all for adopting a teenager, OP; teenagers are too often just left to rot in orphanages/the foster care system until they get kicked out and are on their own at 18, because most parents just want to adopt "babies" they can mold after themselves. I definitely want to adopt teenagers when I'm older, and have the money to support a child myself, for exactly this reason; so it warms my heart to see a young teenage kid getting the love support that's so often denied to them. :,)
I'm here for the eye rolls and you guys delivered
Everyone is talking about the eyeroll pic but the 4th one cracked me up much more, lol.

As a former foster kid/homeless teen, thank you for helping him out. Having a stable home means so much. Not just right now, but for the rest of his life. It can truly change the course of someone's existence.
This is so wholesome, this has further influenced me to adopt a teenager when I'm ready to have kids, thank you!
This is adorable. Congrats to all involved.
I'm adopted and so are 50% of my kids. This sort of thing makes me cry with happiness.
At first I read it as "Abortion Reveal", and was like: "people are doing WHAT now?"
What a handsome young man! You guys look like a family full of love
my daughter once told me that she never rolled her eyes at me. never laughed so hard ever!
What do we gotta do to get more of these people on this planet?
Congratulations on the awesome addition to your family!
Christ. These are legitimately the photos you see in movies that make you think 'nobody ever takes pictures like these'. You guys have a beautiful family.
I grew up in foster care and aged out, it always makes me so happy when I see other kids find their forever family. One day I hope I can provide that to a teen as well.
He's the same size as his dad but still likes being put upside down 😊. Love this.
From one adoptive parent to another…congratulations.
Eye roll is the best, especially followed by the bright and happy smile.
This is why I want to adopt! Not just for the photo ops but that smile you captured is amazing and makes me have hope for all the children up for adoption to find families like yours.

Thanks for sharing!
if this is me and my family, i'm framing that eyeroll pic and putting it up in a place where everyone can see it. 

that's awesome
Have been a teacher for years. There is nothing more sad than an older child forgotten in the system and there is nothing more special than one who finds their family. 

Congratulations on being united with your son against all odds. Many happy returns!
Normally I hate non animal posts in r/aww but this is great and wholesome af
This post has really made me consider adopting. I'm adopted myself and my parents saved from from what was a miserable life and put me into a position to be able to live a fruitful and happy one. I already have a daughter, but I also want a son, and being able to remove a kid from the system and give him the same opportunities really gives me a sense of purpose I haven't really felt anywhere else
I usually hate seeing people on this sub. But this one can stay, for sure. You folks are all really cute and will be great for each other, I'm sure.
You just got him and your already embarrassing him. Good job!!!
Bless you for adopting a teenager. Most of them just stay in the system until they're 18 then end up on the streets or in prison
As an adopted child this makes me very happy. I’ve been seeing so much negativity and misunderstanding when it comes to adoption lately, so it makes me thankful that people like your family exist. You all look so proud to be together. If you guys ever need someone to talk to or some insights from a new adult adopted person please feel free to message me! That goes to anyone reading this. I just recently met my bio families and have a lot of experience to share!
Adorable. Never understood the shoes thing, but y'all look happy as shit and that's all that matters.
Didn’t see the baby at first and thought that these were tiny ass shoes for a thirteen year old
Hmm where’s the explosion? 😛
Which one is adopted?
Congrats and good on you for adopting. I don’t have any basis for this claim but I feel like teens would face a harder time being picked for adoption because everyone wants babies. I think you guys did a really great thing and I’m sure your new son appreciates it
Y’all are gonna look back on this and be so glad you did this.  Hell I think we’re all glad you did this lol
Knew a white lady who was out of touch but really sweet going for adoption.

She had 4 really good friends who were black and told her how shitty it was to get adopted since nobody wanted black people much.

My friend has an instant connection to one of the little black girls since she knows a lot about hip hop, black hairstyles, struggles, etc.

When talking to the adoption lady she forgot the girl's name and says, "I want the black one". 

She told me the lady looked at her mouth open wide before she realized what she said.

Edit: sorry about the cliff hanger. She adopted. It was about 20 years ago . The girl is going into electrical engineering. They're best friends and do everything together😃
I’ve always known I’d be a stepdad, and frequently thought about getting fixed and adopting…

That smile when he is nearly upside down is worth everything, I hope to one day make my family and children as happy as that
Well done, fam! Teens are notoriously difficult to get adopted.  Seeing this is lovely
Twist ending when everyone got snatched right out of their shoes!!
Oh this is genuinely sweet and wholesome
My son is the same age, and it’s unbearable for me to think of him not having a family and being alone in the world. 

This is awesome, wishing you all the best. Congrats on the addition to your family.
Unlike a gender reveal you could actually justify blowing something up or catching it on fire 

"How could you do this! 25 acres of forest turned to nothing!!!!"

"Uhhh, that's true, but honestly we could have burned down like 200 acres of rain forest and still had a smaller carbon footprint than bringing a second kid into the world"

"............"

Jokes aside congratulations!!!!!
Such a beautiful family, congrats!!
That is awesome!  Thank you for restoring a little hope in that people still care for adopting older kids.  I wish you all the best of luck!
FINALLY a reveal event that’s not stupid as fuck! Congratulations 🎈
This is the only reveal I've ever enjoyed.
What a beautiful family!!
I literally teared up reading this.

Ex care kid here.

I'd read it's really hard for boys over the age of three to find adoptive parents. I'm so so happy to see some older kids can find love. The photo with your wife....that is a child who feels safe, and loved. It's so wonderful to feel safe. It's everything.

 PS if he didn't eye roll I'd be worried ; )
Didn't have to burn down a whole forest over it either. Good looks guys.
Everything abt this is super wholesome and wonderful      You have a beautiful, happy family.
Awe! 

He looks so incredibly happy. Thank you for giving this young man love and stability. I hope he finds his happiness in the world. I couldn't imagine how difficult the world would be to navigate as a foster child. 
Such a beautiful family. I love that he was willing enough to participate in these photos!
Wait wait wait - is there another on the way? Last picture for some tiny baby shoes

Edit Nevermind missed the actual baby.
Now THIS is the type of reveal I'll always love seeing! You've made a tremendously wonderful impact on this young man's life! Adoption is a beautiful thing.
I remember a set of commercials for adoption, and the thing that always stuck with me was the tag line " there are thousands of kids willing to put up with you". 
I am so very happy for your family, now more complete. I wish you all the best in life, and hope that each day is pure joy, even the hard ones.
I wish you and your beautiful family all the best!
This is wonderful!!!
Those shoes got me. Congratulations to your new edition!
That photo of you hugging him and he’s got that big smile on his face… omg… my heart… instantly crying!!! 

I’ve always wanted to adopt, since I was very little it’s been the way I would want to grow my family and when I met my life partner and learned that he is adopted and also would prefer adoption if we ever decided to expand our family I was elated. We’re not likely to be in a position to do that any time soon, but there is time and if we ever get there I’ll definitely want to take some similar photos. Thank you for sharing.
This will forever be better than any gender reveal.
The first picture is my favorite! He looks like he’s tall for 13! Maybe I just don’t see many teenagers lol. Congratulations, I know he’s gonna be an awesome big brother!
Fecking adorable
My jaded old soul loves this.
My wife aodopted my two kids. While not the same it was painstaking process requiring all sort of state invovlement and I cannot be more proud or happy for the both of you.
Yall some gorgeous/handsome mf'ers.
And you know what...by god...I think I see a proper line up. Happy for that young man. They are clearly the right family.
I'm not crying,  you are
That’s one handsome fella! Congratulations :)
The Omg mom and dad take the pic already feel in pic 3 is my favorite. When they feel annoyed by all the pics you take you are truly their parents.
Absolutely beautiful!!!
I'm literally crying at my desk right now. Holy shit this is beautiful
You guys are amazing
So perfect. What a beautiful family.
Congrats on your new addition!
I'm not crying, you're crying.
 
This is just too beautiful! Thank you for sharing.
Yooo a reveal I can get behind
warms the cockles of me heart, it does... arrrr matey
I love this!! I'm adopted and I know how impossible it is for older kids to get a chance! Great work OP, looks like a fun family.
Haha the shoe pic especially made me lol
What a lucky kid. He seems pumped and so do you guys. Brought a tear to my eye. Congratulations!!!
This is so beautiful! Such a wonderful family.
This is the only child reveal I ever want to see again.
I’ve haven’t wanted kids since becoming an adult but this makes me want to adopt some day.
This is hilarious 😂  and lovely 🥰 Congratulations!!!
These always feel like they’re more for social media than they are for the family. 

Did people do this shit with Polaroids back in the day?
Good for you guys! Congrats!
Precious 💛
That’s awesome, it’s so rare to see something about an adopted teen
This is the only reveal I can get behind…unless it’s for pets lol
Did they ship him in the box?

In all seriousness though, this is awesome and I hope the box had airholes.
Thank you OP for adopting an older child. 

You saved a life with a selfless act. Much respect.
If there's a box on my lawn and it has a teenager inside, I'm going to be pretty angry with Santa this year. I asked for a lawnmo- oh, wait...
Love it ❤️
Love this! And no fires were caused too!
The eye roll was the best part
I love the eye roll.  Those are my favorite.
I think reveals are lame but I love this one!
As an adoptee- I support this message.
Beautiful family, it’s hard to pic but I think my fav is where you’re holding him upside down lol!
I could feel that eye roll through my monitor.
~sniff~
Well I just teared-up! that was cute and I can see all the love emanating from each pic. Yep, especially the eye-roll!
As an adoptee, this makes me happy.
Third pic proves he's your son.  Same look my kids give me when I kiss them!

Love it, congrats!!!
That’s so sweet! But I love how the dad deadass just lifted that teen boy up like he’s ten pounds. 😂
Holy fuck. That kid is so lucky. I’ve never ever seen such unbridled joy while hugging a parent. Man I wish I had better parents lol
I love all of these photos, and the story behind them. I'm gonna set my phone down while my heart is is singing from all this happiness and wholesomeness.

Congratulations on the official adoption of your son, OP! You photos radiate warmth, and fun, and happiness, thank you for sharing them. 💝
That's so awesome. I was adopted asa teenager too and I still can't believe how lucky I was. I went from one of the worst situations imaginable to a stable home with loving parents. I owe everything I have to them
I missed the newly part and was thinking the eye roll was because it was so obvious for the past 13 years
Thank you for adopting a teenager. Its really unfortunate teens in fostercare arent taken in like young kids are
Love this so much!
Congrats!
Lovely family! Congratulations!
This definitely made me laugh.  It also reminded me (and I hope this isn't rude) of the scene in Easy A:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-oTeK2lBpdg

Man, Tucci is the best.
Beautiful. What a lucky family to have such a wonderful new son.
Good on you brother. We need more people who are willing take on responsibility like this.
VERY touching post!  Not the creepy touching in the boy scout / Catholic church sort of way either, so that's a bonus!
!groot
!GROOT
Anyone have a link to this story? It’s beautiful
I could not love this any more. Beautiful.
WHY AM I CRYING AT MY DESK ABOUT THIS. I love it so much
Some unboxing that was
Holy crap this is literally the only child thing that has ever made me go awwww on this damned ap
this is better than cat photos
the eye rolls were my favorite, and I am SO not crying
Beautiful family! ❤
The second to last picture is absolutely gorgeous, both mom and son look like models!
Man this caught me totally off guard. Seriously made me tear up. Beautiful family. Congratulations to all three of you.
I have 4 adopted siblings. It’s so great that all of you found each other! Also, he looks annoyed in a couple of pics. Good job parenting!
I can't wait to adopt a kid, I don't want to have my own.
This is the best thing I have seen in a long time!  Thank-you so much for sharing it with us!  All the best to you and your awesome family!!!
You guys are my type of people. Wonderful.
I wish there were more people like your family.
These are so sweet! I love this, especially slide four hahaha
What a beautiful family!
Awesome pictures
Honestly made my day
That made me laugh out loud.  Love to y'all.

My half sister was adopted.  Now she has her bio-family plus the family she grew up with.  Family is the best gift ever!
[removed]
Wholesome. Lucky young man, and a lucky family.
Man adoption is tough for kids. My dad still hasn’t met his biological parents. Found out one is dead, they never reached out to him. Can’t imagine the internalizing that happens to some of these children.
This cheered me up today, thank you!!!
This is awesome i hope all of you have an awesome life.
Congratulations!
I absolutelly Loved The big bro shoes next to The little one!
I love this so much!! Congratulations on your adoption! ♥
Double kiss pic is classic!! lol.  Nice work.
Better than any gender reveal I’ve ever seen
I must be the only one who finds "reveals" to be nauseating
Beautiful pictures! I wish you a long and happy family.
happy adoption day, bud!
Yup, made me smile. Gratzie mille!
The pic of you holding him is solid gold. This made my day
Well, thank you, this just made my yucky week end with such a buzz of happiness! Wishing you all a happy and peaceful life together ❤
Awesome

Best of luck to you and your family

That's awesome. Any time a family adopts a child it's such a beautiful thing.
You're a great couple and the world needs more like you.
This makes me so happy. Everyone deserves a loving family...even the hateful people on this post.
This made me so happy seeing this! 
An older teen getting adopted and family having a fun celebration! Awesome ! 
Happy adoption day! 🎂
Eye rolls bring the pictures together 🤣
This is the only acceptable revel party!
Beautiful smiles run in the family!! :)
Looks like you kidnapped him and he burst out screaming.
This is super cute. Y'all make a lovely family.

This is wholesome, and so awesome
[deleted]
These threads are the best sorted by controversial.
This is the best thing I've seen here for a while!
I am so confused as to what is happening here?  did you just adopt the 13 year old as a 13 year old.. and are announcing it to everyone?  Or did the child live with you for awhile.. either way, congratulations to your family.
This is so wholesome
This will be a meme
Can I say , thankyou uv changed someone life most likely for the best . U should take a minute and realize u could have just changed the world for the better! Be proud of that and I wish u guys a happy life
I fucking love this
I love this 💜💜
This makes me so happy!
This is so freaking adorable and I'm usually a cynic. I love this.
This is wholesome and I totally teared up looking at these. Thanks for doing what you do.
This is the best thing I’ve seen all year, and it’s December.

This is fantastic and congratulations to the whole family!
The goddamn energy on that first pic. That kid's ready for battle! 

Seriously though, you have such a beautiful family.
This is the only "gender" reveal I want. I love it. Congratulations to all of you!
I love this, this fills my heart with joy knowing he gets such loving parents
This is easily the best part of my day. Thank you for sharing your wonderful family
Beautiful… What a beautiful family.
This is the absolute cutest! You have a beautiful family
Wholesome.
Congrats on you beautiful family
Love the sheer terror in the first photo. Is that when they realized they're not a biological child

Who the hell is cutting onions in here???? 😭

Seriously, you guys are amazing people!!
Kids got a great smile
How did you meet? What the story?
This some wholesome ass shit
I have zero connection to adoptions or adoptees and this post made me cry.  Congrats to an awesome family! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I pray I can do this one day

Edit: the adoption not the box😂😂😂
This is very odd to me
Wow I love this!
This would go under r/parentsbeingbros if it existed. (Hint: I don’t have time to moderate a subreddit.)

The shoes had me dying with laughter.
In number 3 “I’m beginning to regret this”
Hehe
Rolls eyes, next pic gets rolled. A fair trade lol.
💜💜
One of the most beautiful family I’ve ever seen.
Omg the screaming like he was kidnapped and stuffed in a box w some balloons…
That eye roll embodies the, “okay fine are we done with the pictures yet for fucks’ sakes”.
You can see they are all touching hands!! Good people all!!❤❤❤
I fucking love this and y’all
Tell him he's not doing teenagering right, he's got something on his face. I believe they call it a smile, that is rare but very nice to see. Love this family, heres to a lovely future
Nice powerbomb
As long as nothing caught fire the world is happy for you.
See that eye roll is the looks of a teen that is well loved but so over “it” at the same time.
My wife and I have no desire to have kids of our own, but very much want to adopt one day. I've heard the entire process is incredibly long and very stressful/aggravating/sad.

Do you mind talking about your experience through it all? How hard was it to adopt and how long did it take?
Who told him he was adopted?
Glad you aren't my parents! I mean that nicely!
Imagine it was a real reveal and they actually had no idea who the kid was before hand and that was the first time seeing him
Omg the upside down one was the  best. He’s smiling like he doesn’t know he’s secretly upside down
Weird
Dad looks like every white guy over 30 on reddit
This is the whitest thing I’ve seen in a long time.

And now I'm crying

So wholesome
I’ve never been so happy to see a teenage eye roll

This is so lovely. I wish you all the best :,)
Oh my gosh you guys are all precious. Looks like a happy home, glad you’re sharing it
The only kind of reveal I care about
My 13 year old thought the same as me - this is adorable. Absolutely perfect.
Omg this is so beautiful. I think I’m gonna cry!
The pic of mom/son hugging?  He looks... calm. <3 My heart can't take it, y'all!
As an adopted kid, I absolutely love this Cheesy Awesomesauce!
r/mademesmile
Now this is the kind of reveal I can get behind.
This is absolutely the best. I love adoption stories.
I love this so much! The beauty and joy. Congratulations!
This is absolutely beautiful.
This is precious
The shoes picture is so sweet
Congrats to everyone! What a lovely family!
How crazy would it be if we sent kids that were adopted home in boxes?

But for real, you are wonderful people. There is no way this kid doesnt know he's found his family.
He looks so happy!!
This made me tear up a little. Love that anyone would give an older kid a chance, doesn’t happen nearly enough
Adopting teens is based 💯
congrats, you guys made a lovely family
3 is gold, his face is obviously a put on, but it's so teenager, so, Ugh, my parents are the worst, they love me so much! It's adorable.
A rare moment on Reddit without baby or animal
That's an awesome reveal!
This is the sweetest thing I’ve seen. I’m not chopping onions you are!
Omg yall are so beautiful congrats!
Super cute what a lucky family
OMG This is brilliant!!
Incredibly sweet!
You done a good thing. Happy Holidays to your growing family!
This is so pure 😭
love is  what binds a family together and am really happy that you guys decided to adopt and spread this kind of love to the boy...congratulations to you guys...and the reveal party is incredible
Bless you guys.
One reveal that actually made me happy, congratulations!
Thank you for this you stranger. Love
Y’all look so happy congratulations!
😭😭😭 this is the first post on aww to make me tear up
Just intereted, how come you opted to adopt a teenage child?  was it on the spot or something planned?
Wonderful!!
r/mademesmile
This makes my heart so warm 🖤
I am obsessed with this
What a beautiful family. Wishing you all lifetimes of happiness and good health together.
Adopted kids mom has got it going on.
This is SO cute everyone looks so happy as they should!
Everyone looked so happy in every photo(except the eyeroll one) :)
Idk why the 4th photo made me laugh so hard.

Maybe cus it is like the way a dad might pick up and carry a baby but a mom never really would? So the dad doing it with a 13 year old, who presumably he didn't know as a baby, is like making up for missed father/son shenanigans
["I'm adopted" "Oh my God! Who told you??"](https://youtu.be/TjpkMfTBVQs )
although i could never do adoption, this is amazing and heart warming.
The new parents are so young.
This made my day. What a beautiful happy family!
Omg!!! I want to get a mysterybox kid!!!
Awesome. Thanks for adopting!
I love this so much!!!
This genuinely made me smile
Day? Made.
Love this💙
I love this so much. What a wonderful family. 🖤
Glad this is prompting adoption especially for the older foster kids who less likely to be adopted.
So you're saying if I adopt a teenage kid...I too can Tombstone him? Interesting...
AMAZING!
This is so cute!! I want to adopt a teen someday.
I can't love this enough
in that last image man got rotated on the Z axis and just sorta was chillin with it. 

Hope yall have a amazing life!
That’s wonderful
I like this so much more than gender reveals.
Best thing I’ve seen on the internet all week ❤️❤️❤️ blessings for your beautiful family
Anyone else ever see something so wholesome the mere idea of it makes you realize how much wholesomeness your own life is missing and as a result makes you somewhat sad but also even that much happier to see the people thriving? Oddly specific sorry LOL
Wonderful.
Thats awesome guys, wishing yall well
This is the type of reveal I can get behind. Congrats!! Your new son is so adorable!!!
Such a beautiful family!
Fuck. This got me in the feels. I want to be a dad.
*eyeroll*

"hey turn that frown upside down" *flip*

"Im ready for your tricks old man"
Y'all are awesome.
The first photo got me with that face
Aw man, after losing my Dad this past year seeing stuff like this makes me remember that feeling of how special it is to be with your family in moments like these. 

Beautiful bunch here, congratulations
Ok the booties were hilarious
Congratulations. To you and to your adoptive son. It's a beautiful thing.
I love all of this! You are good peoples
3rd pic he looks like YNW Melly.
I thought my heart couldn't get fuller after the individual parent pics with him, and then there was the shoes. Heart has burst.
This is so precious, it melted my cranky old heart!
Haha that's brilliant. Congrats to all you guys.
💞
This made me teary eyed!!

My friends are trying so hard right now to foster to adopt. I don't know if these pics will encourage them or make them sad because they're struggling. 

What a beautiful family, you all look so happy!
This is beautiful!
True Kodak moments
So adorable, wishing y’all the best! Please never be afraid of what you don’t know, cause people will always be around to help y’all.
This is soooo sweet! This is a “reveal” I can fully get behind!
You look very happy! I wish you all the best!
This is so awesome, shout out to you for everything you do
This is the ONLY “reveal” I want to see from here on out!
This is the best! Literally made me tear up looking at this you guys are so lucky to have found each other. ❤️
I fuckin love this! Congrats to all of you!
Am I the only one that scrolled past this post only to think Kevin Hart was popping up from the box?
This is awesome, congrats!
You and your family look so happy. I’m truly happy for you!
An eye rolling teenager is the best you can hope for.
I love the eye roll. Even though it's probably staged in fun and games, there's an underlying message there that says they expect him to be a normal teen and not perfect. It acknowledges they while I'm sure he's grateful for their love and the adoption, that he's still an imperfect human being whom they will allow to be himself.
Congratulations to your whole family! I am a proud adoptive father of two amazing young women who still break my heart every day!! :) :)
The smiles tell it all.  Congratulations to all of you!

Oh man the joy in these photos.
This seems exploitative

You're doing God's work. I hope your family prospers.
That eye roll photo is a treasure.
This is amazing
Hey power to you!

We had friends recently go through adopting a pair of older siblings. It took TWO years for it to go through. Endless court meetings and it kept dragging on and on. Our friends and their children bonded pretty quickly so the extra dragging of everything was really stressful (getting Bio parents to give up their rights).

During that time they couldn't share photos publically of the children so when it finally went through it was a breath of fresh air for everyone.

Anyway, congrats on your new child!
So cute. That eyeroll is magnificent. Congratulations!

This is the single best thing I've ever seen on the internet. (And I've seen a lot of kittens on the internet)
Thanks for making my day a little brighter! You guys are amazing!
This is the most adorable thing I’ve seen. And the third pic is priceless. Props to dad for being able to  pick kiddo up and turn him upside down. Classic dad move.
This is the best thing I have seen in a long time. I love a happy ending!
What a happy looking young man. Hope you all make lots of memories together!
The kid screaming is my favorite.
Awww the last one killed me
Lucky kid.
You all look beautiful. This is very nice.
This is so cute! I’m adopted myself so this hits home and makes me so glad to seem them all so joyous.

I can’t stand gender reveal parties, but I adore every parody of them—gender re-reveal parties for trans kids coming out, adoption parties like this, pet pregnancy announcements that turn into adoption/spaying drives for the puppies, etc.
What an absolutely beautiful family!
This warms my heart. Congratulations to you and your family!
this is so beautiful (‘:
So this is incredibly nice to see but definitely has a “give me attention and likes” vibe also
I needed this today, thank you. 😭😍
This is so fucking cool. Good job guys
Wow I'm crying. So  precious.
I love everything about this soooo much! Congratulations, may you all have many years of happiness! Hugs!!!!!! Xo
I love horchata

Damnit, I’m crying at work now!
You have a beautiful family!
That kid looks so happy , I'm so happy
Wow he got tiny feet
Man  this is the one time where I wish I had a free Award.
This is so cute!!!
im happy for y'all
So stinking cute!!! We adopted our youngest. We became foster parents for my cousin’s son and adopted him after 18 months, that was 9 years ago
What a beautiful family you have!
Stepmom help!
Oh happy day!  Love it!
Very cool!
Amazing! Wish all the happiness to the four of you
Bet they ordered the Alex Chesterfield on Wayfair!
Im not crying
Haha this is awesome. Good for you guys.
This is the only reason why there should be a reveal party.
Hope for the best for all three of you, my mother tried adoption a good few years back and it sadly backfired badly. Hope it’s different with you of course.

Just try the best you can and hope you’re good enough, because the boy deserves the best, they always do like this. Good luck and I wish the best of luck for you all.
Congrats. Keep up the good work.
This is true kindness
The giant shoes! Aaaaah!
Lol
The third picture is the best.
This is amazing!!
That photo of the mom and son on their own. My eyes started leakin.
That third photo is everything 💚 Congrats!
This is just the sweetest thing. I love it
What did he think of it?
Congratulations to all of you. Incredibly exciting and I wish you guys a happy life together.
Congratulations on your new family!!!! The eye roll pic is priceless!!!

Adorable. Eye-rolls and all. Congratulations!
The 4th picture is amazing! It seems he found a good home!
