Super cute!  Is Grandpa friends with the neighborhood animals or was this a random occurrence?
Grandpa is a Disney prince
I love him. Since my mom passed my dad has gotten totally into making friends with all the little critters around his property. He's feeding stray cats, raccoons, possums, and just yesterday he was worried about the nutrition of deers only eating corn so he went out and bought "deer food". He sends me pictures of his critters daily. At least he lives outside city limits so he's allowed.
Most epic first phone selfie EVER. His facial expression makes the chipmunk seem so casual.  LOVE IT!
That's adorable. 

Why do animals love Grandparents? Why don't they love me too?
Trying to decide which is more likely:

* OP's grandpa is a chipmunk holding a selfie stick with its tail.
* An elderly man can operate a cell phone camera.

For fuck's sake, how do you become friends with a friggin' chipmunk?
Chipmunk is like dude, warn me next time. My mouth was full and I was making a face.
Chipmunk for scale.
I love when people seem to be looking at the button and not the camera when they take a selfie. I’m looking at you old folks, but you’re not looking at me.
So glad your grandpa let that man help him with his first selfie, he just needs to remember to take a picture of the food before he eats it!
[removed]
That’s amazing chipmunks are extremely skiddish, your gramps has to be a kind soul!
Living his best life. Cheers!
Paw paw and his chipmunk!
[removed]
Which one is your Grandpa?
Grandpa found the Disney princess filter.
Chipmunk and Grandpa have the same expression on their faces.
Did Gramps feed the chipmunk his own eyeballs??

But for real, this old dude chilling with this little guy is the boost I needed this afternoon.
Good for him
Big flex
As I was scrolling down, the squirrel was a surprise lolll
What is with grandpas taming squirrels and chipmunks. My grandpa had a squirrel that would come eat walnuts out of his hand/shirt pocket. It was exciting as a kid to handfeed a wild squirrel lol
This reminded me of my papa, who has full on conversations with the squirrels in his yard. It's gotten to the point where the squirrels try to talk to other people and get all huffy when they don't talk back
That's one awesome grandpa.
The other day a different photo of the same man was posted with a claim it was grandpa's first selfie.
Dad doesn’t want squirrel family gets squirrel anyway dad and squirrel
Literally better than every photo I’ve ever taken
The squirrel makes it
🥰
That is an album cover
Better than any selfie I’ve taken. Ever.
Is that his pet chipmunk?
Rocking those black demon eyes. Very nice
Why is this mans better at taking selfies than any teenage girl ever
My dad has squirrel-friends too! And a deer posse! He's 76 and lives alone, I call him Snow White lol
"Hangin out w/ Deez" 

(next text) 

"Deeze Nutz lol"
What a haus haha
/r/oldpeoplefacebook
This man is starting off strong and IT SHOWS
Damn your grandpa is looking like a squirrel
soo cute
Wow this reminded me how much I love my grandparents 

So many people get magical as they age
Awww, makes me miss my PaPa. Love this.
So, you forgot to mention that your grandpa is a Disney princess...
I love your grandpa.
Alvin and the chipmunks: the retirement home
He has already mastered the discretion process of "does the moment warrant a selfie?"
Squirrel “wait, I’m not ready”
Please help Grandpa set up an Instagram to share his Disney life!
Awwww your Grandpa is so cute. It was so nice of that old man to take a photo with him
Grandpa might be late to the game, but he's killing it!!
How is this better than any selfie I’ve ever taken
Bruh your grandpa small as hell
Amazing grandpa you have, so cool ahaha.
I love Reddit so much for posts like this and comments like these.
HE IS A ROCK STAR
This man is exuding unbridled charm. Swag grandmaster , he is.
That man is a wise ancient God of nature. Cherish him
Old people are so awesome
Your grandpa is Harry Redknapp!
Your grandpa is a disney princess!
"OMG grandpa don't post that! I look terrible with food in my mouth!"
we need an r/grandpaselfies
Omg that's the best
So cute❤️
Who is the old man next to your grandpa?
Is he a Disney Princess now?
Can we get an ‘old person selfies’ sub?!?!
Cute grandpa. Looks a little nuts.

Who's the old guy hes sitting on?
Dude your grandpa is a Disney princess
Your grandpa is an icon
Chipmunk came to steal his nuts,  realized he's still alive
Your grandpa is a squirrel...wait are you a squirrel
Not to be dramatic but I would die for your grandpa and his squirrel
The squirrel looks sooo happy and then the grandpa is just sitting there like....
omg i’m obsessed with this..
Sorry you failed to mention your grandpa was a literal animal charmer... or potential Disney prince...
I love old chill dudes, they have such a fun character, by that age they know what's important and what's not. If you are fortunate they will share their thoughts and tell you stories and you can learn a lot from them.
I showed this picture to my cousin and she loved it so much that she teared up. She had a squirrel that was a pet for a long time.
Squirrel go brrr
This man is extremely handsome.
Grandparents are the most precious people ever.
When I get this old, I can only dream to be this current. Grandpa taking selfies with squirrels, just god damn amazing.
All of these "wHiCh OnE iS YoUr gRaNdPa?" comments are so stupid. These people think they're funny and original but there's only about 50 variations of that exact comment here
He's a Disney Princess!!
I used to feed chipmunks like this, until someone said, “Aren’t you worried about getting bubonic plague?” I laughed, then Googled it. I now feed them at more of a distance
I hope all you people are getting permission from your grandparents to post their photos on the internet.

Otherwise this is fucked just like yesterday's grandpa selfie.
#🐿️
Does ur grandpa not have eyes
Your grandpa is a chipmunk?
Which one is your grandpa???
I can't decide who is cuter.
This is the BEST!!
So cute
Ngl your grandpa can take pictures better than most of us.
This is the coolest thing I have seen all day.
He looks so smug I love it
granpa is a fucking baws!
"That photo makes my cheeks look huge!"
Damn it , Norm. Not while I’m eating.
do i even need to say it? (Awww)
You have an awesome Grandpa !
Damn, that chipmunk is grocery shoppin
This is he purest thing I have ever seen
How?
nutboyz
Aahhw
Old people are always cool without even trying
Your grandpa is a damn alpha male
Quite an unusual pair of friends
This photo has made my day. These two are adorable!
"Excuse me, I'm eating."
Good job gramps 👍🏼
What a handsome young man!
they're a badass duo
Who is the old guy?
This is quality content!
Your grandpa seems pretty cool
You’re grandpa is cute!  Little stripe, and cute little cheeks!
Looks like that chipmunk is playing a flute.
Legendary. Didnt think I'd wake up to see an old man's nuts in some chips mouth
Is this in Queens NY? Its giving me Queens vibes! 😊
That's a weird looking phone
What's your grandpa doing with that old man?
Day 1 and he’s already an expert?
Who's his friend? The one with the green shirt
Your gramp seems like a cool sweet guy :)
I love them both!!
So you’re a squirrel?
The years were not kind to Dave and Alvin... all they had left, was each other. ALVIIIIIIIN!!!
I can’t even get my kids to take a picture with me, and there’s grandpa with a chipmunk. Amazing.
You didn't tell me your grandfather was Snow White.
this is precious
Who’s that guy your grandpa is sitting on
It was nice of that old man to give your grandpa a hand with the camera.
That's a chipmunk, not a phone.
Aw so sweet. Those cheeks.
This is one of the best selfies I have ever seen. Meme worthy
That's nuts.
He looks like he used to hunt Nazis back in the days
\-is that a little smile i see peepin thru grampa??
This is the content I live for.
Minibears are brazen creatures with a singular audacity.
*How the hell does this human have a CHIPMUNK on his BODY???"
Pretty good selfie for a first!  Who's the old guy photobombing?
I love everything about this picture so much
Selfie Swag🤠😎😎
Please, take this free award. This picture brings me so much joy.
Your grandpa is the squirrel whisperer?
Is...is that his chipmunk or a visitor...?
good
When the server asks you how the food tastes.
Oh he’s adorable!!  What a great picture ❤️
Why does he have a chipmunk and where can I get one?!
And now I know what I wanna be when I grow up.
Would land here.
Possibly the BEST first selfie, hell, best ANY selfie ever. Love it.
What a bad ass! Look cool Gramps keep up the good work!
Badass
Better than any selfie I have ever taken. I have failed as a millennial.
What is it with Grandfathers and chipmunks? My gramps has his buddy “Chippy” that he feeds peanuts whenever he’s outside smoking cigars.
I’m so jealous.
👏👏👏❤️❤️❤️
aww, him with a friend? perfect selfie
This has such a powerful aura
Quality over quantity. Impressive selfie that is.
Protect this man at all costs!
Hey that's my grandpa, you stole my phone you phoney
Imagine this is your life, just hanging out with your squirrel buddies on the porch all day. I cannot wait for that to be my life someday!!
My grandpa made a skeptical face on his first selfie as well :D but no squirrel :(
"Goddamn squirrel ate my nuts"
This is the best selfie ever!
He really said- 😼

Pfft this is great.
Oh this reminds me. Can old people blow up their cheeks like a chipmunk? I can imagine some serious cheek size with those flabby cheeks. I've never seen someone old do it and I just wonder if they're hiding something from us
Take my upvote! #LifeGoals
That’s the most flex ever captured on any device.
I think it is safe to say that your grandpa just took the best selfie ever
It's perfect.
Better selfie than I've ever taken!
oh wow, this guy's grampa is a Disney princess.
Legend.
Your grandpa might be a Disney Princess
And probably the last...
Of course he has a straight face while posing with a squirrel!  LOL
awww.... I love it.. Thanks for sharing
That’s precious!
Ha, the chipmunks in my yard just peep defiantly at me and run off.  My attempts to make them my friends with food goes poorly.
Your grandpa and his chipmunk friend have totally made my day.
The Elder Goals
Your grandpa has a better front camera than mine.
Gramps should filled his cheeks up like the squirrel:D
Feels like Alvin and the chipmunks 50 years in the future... That dudes got style
This picture is worthy of a like <3
This is so good
Holup didn't we see this guy yesterday??
I find it really funny that all the comments that have a lot of downvotes all have the same joke. “Which one is your grandpa?”
So u have to be a very young chipmunk I guess. Cool lookin Hooman is with ur grandpa!
God bless him.
Cuteeeeeee
He missed a golden opportunity to puff his cheeks out like his too were full of nuts.
You mean the album cover to his upcoming rap ep!
When I get into my golden years, I too will have a squirrel bro.
Full cheeks, full heart...
I looked like the squirrel when i got my wisdom tooth taken out 💀
Does grandpa know he’s got 33000 upvotes? Awesome
I thought he was wearing a squirrel shirt but actually wow he’s Cinderella

How come old people always make friends with the best animals!?! So pure 😍
Man and munk
Love this
I have several questions
Yo wtf, your grandpa looks so cool ahahahahha. How old is he?
Grandpa is OG!
The chipmunk: sup, how ya doing.
Call the pope and canonize this guy
That's awesome
I love this
Sp beautiful so perfect, Lord how I miss my Grandpa. A lover of art and a friend to Nature.

It is magic to get old and revere what you hardly ever noticed, and it is recognized by life.
Wholesome
Didnt your grandpa notices that there was an elder gentleman behind him photobombing his selfie?
Wat a cooool grandad...my granmummyyy splurps to me all thr time
Everyone liked this
What’s his @?
My brain is fighting between "this is a cute old man" and "please don't habituate wild animals"
i hope they will be best friends
He knows what he’s doing.
Okay what is with the elderly and chipmunks? My great grandmother was also frequently coated in chipmunks. I swear they have an alliance!
ALLLLVINNNNNN
Dem some

#THICC CHEEKS
Chipmunk be like, "huh? What happened?"
Famous Grandpa!
Normally i dont like humans in r/aww but old people are cute, I can't deny it
Who’s that guy in the back?
Who are all the people ITT that cannot tell a squirrel from a chipmunk?

They'd have a stroke trying to tell a chipmunk from a gopher.
wooow
Grandpa with the thirst traps ok
Cool grandpa. Who's the old man though?
So was he randomly hanging out with that old man?
How many nuts are in his mouth?
who's the guy with your grandpa
Hell yeah
look at them nuts
Looks like the guy who collects people's library debts in Seinfeld.
Legend
he has an interesting crew
Who’s that human behind him?
How he get that kinda trust though?
45k likes for a grandpa photo?
First selfie...how's he going to top that? He's certainly raised the bar here. I'm waiting..
He looks like Saul Goodman’s brother haha
Lol
Im call that squirrel joey chestnut
Your grandpa is fae
Sure are a lot of Grandpas taking their first ever selfies this week.
Where'd he get a chipmunk?
Nice, He's adorable!    
Who's the dude in the green shirt?
This is it. Peak internet. We need nothing more. 

Hello to your grandpa! If he needs some more grandkids ill put in an app
Adorable as hell
Needs to be shred on r/wholesome
Copy
R/grampasfirstselfie
What
He looks like a prospector who went West, bought a pan, stuck it in Sutter's Creek, and pulled out a huge gold nugget.


Then he retired to spend more time with his squirrel.
Time to unbutton the shirt another notch gramps! You’ve earned it!
r/ElderlySelfies
LOOK AT THOSE CHEEKS! 

Also, your granpa looks like he think "I am not amused"
Your grandpa is James Mattis?
Who's the old dude with your grandpa?
He waited for the right time, and boy did he knock it out of the park with this one
That chipmunks got a werthers butterscotch stashed in each cheek
Grandpa Alvin an his chipmunk!
I love the smirk.
This is indeed adorable!
Aww. This is the real and raw picture. And I will say he looks so handsome.
Look at the cheeks on that little guy! 😻
Amazing how pet owners end up looking sort of like their pets.
Your grandpa is a chipmunk...?
Grandpa is happy with his grandchild :3
Aww, I was wondering where lil Jimmy had run to ! 😄🤷🏻‍♀️
Cute
Awesome photo! My wife and I are still chuckling at the squirrel's mouth stuffed full
ALVINNNN
Which one is your grandpa?
Love his little companion in the selfie!! Grandpa looks like a boss 😃😆
He is good at this
Are you human or a chipmunk?
Does your grandpa keep that human as a pet?
Awesome!!! Yip animals are drawn to our gentle elders😇
The chipmunk is like “did it go? Have you taken the photo yet? I didn’t hear the noise”
Ur gampa is a badass.
I can't wait for that to be me someday
Bless this man
See? I knew Mattis was a big softie... just don't say it to his face... or to anyone in the military.  


Guess that Don't Ask, Don't Tell Policy was really working out for him tho...  


Wait til he starts singing...
Is that his squirrel or a wild one ?
U/repostueth
Who's the old guy behind your grandpa?
His phone looks fuzzy and full of nuts
Awwwwww
Your grandfather rules!
Best thing in my feed this week.
I had one once so cute!!
I think your Gramps one Selfieing
AWW HAHA
Thousand yard stare and love for the furry little guys :3
Check for pulse?
Nothing makes him surprised? Even squirrel on him?😂
When i see one, im excited every time😂😂😂
Awwwwwww give grandpa a hug for me!  I miss mine!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤ I LOVE THIS
Which one is your grandpa?
Which one is your grandad?
I thought the first one he took was the one he emailed you 5 times?
I want to know how I can make a chipmunk friend.
Holy shit thats the cutest thing I've seen
Look at dem cheeks
This made me smile. Love them both.❤
Now, that's a text.
Your grandpa is cute, but who is the old man?
Chipmunk is me when the waitress asks if I need anything.
This low key made me say aww
He didn't have to flex that hard
This picture is adorable.

I just want to mention, because I have seen it in the comments, that the critter in question is not a chipmunk. It appears to be a Golden Mantle Ground Squirrel.

As someone who spent years pointing out the differences to guests in Tahoe, it can be confusing. Chipmunks are much smaller than squirrels and that stripe they share extends all the way to the face and over the eyes of a chipmunk.
How did he get it to come that close!
Grandpa Chip and his friend Dale
perfect. both.
So. Is this his squirrel or just a random squirrel ?
Well done gramps.
I wish my grandpa was still here- :(
*that’s not your grandpa...that’s a squirrel*
Your grandpa is a chipmunk?
I luv it 😊
Scroll for it!
Bro that chipmunk being so cool rn, grandpa pog moment
Who comes up with bs titles?
*smiles in wholesome*
He’s happy because he’s insane. You know what, that’s the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate.
Which one is your grandpa?
Those CHEEKS. I can't even handle it
I love this so much 🥺🥺
Nice
Precious

I would score your grandpa on a 8/10 coolness factor just for this selfie lol but my grandpa plays Minecraft so...
This is a super cute image. But is it really a selfie?
This guy must have a bunch of grandchildren.
this is sooo adorableeeeeeeee
damn, hes doing selfies better than a 23y/o me
Whoa, your grandpa is a chipmunk, Cool
:o

AWwwww......

/h
Is that Chip or Dale? I could never tell.
It’s Dave and Theodore
Super cute grandpa loves his Chick munk phone
Who is the old guy with your grandpa?
I have seen anything more Disney
Never knew they'd look so much like cartoons! (The chipmunk, not the granddad)
not gonna lie, his phone looks a bit like a squirrel
Best pic so far 2021 
And .... 
this will most likely be used for a meme
First selfie that chipmunk took with his phone
Setting the bar high, gonna be hard to out do that pic :)
r/TILI
He's a Disney princess!
What is he dr dolittle wtf
This photo has all the makings of a really good Disney flik.
He looks like a pretty cool guy. Hope he enjoys the new phone (and maybe starts a chipmunk Instagram)
Your grandpa knows he's cool as fuck.
He is a disney princess now.
Super beautiful pic of grandpa I really like that grandpa.
Why is this better than any selfie I have ever taken
Freakin awesome photo!! 😅🤩
Hey, Grandad. Lookin sharp with your tiny friend, there.
Omg soo cute
Your grandpa knows alvin!?
Nice! As a kid, I trained chipmunks to go in my pockets and dig out sunflower seeds, and peanuts. On rainy days I  would open the door and feed them from my chair in the living room.
Chipmunk and chum!
At least someone has nuts in their mouth.
So cute 😍
Is your grandpa a Disney princess?
There's another UP-esque movie in here somewhere...
Your grandpa is so fuckin cool dude
There are an awful lot of grandpas taking their first selfish in the last 2 days. I saw one yesterday that's almost identical of some guy's 92 year old gramps. I actually checked your profile to see if it was you posting it.
That is such a cute picture!!
swag
awwww that's so cute
hahaha thats awesome :D
look like grandpa & his lovely son
dude thats the  character from the disney movie
My dad loved chilling with the various animals that came around. He even installed a gate in the backyard fence to allow wild turkeys to come in. 

I recently bought a home and am currently trying to befriend my own wild life 😄
I feel like this was actually the chipmunks selfie
Cute old people selfies like this are so wholesome. This one is extra cute with his little buddy.
That’s incredible, thanks for sharing!
I immediately have so many questions
Dope
And you are a chipmunk? ;)
Hey
Tell him we love him.
Theodore?
So dang cute
please tell him i love him
Awesome!! So is the guy you grandad or the squirrel?
ALVIN!
How awesome is this 
Your grandpa rocks💙💙💙
Oh that’s precious. My grandpa that just passed used to feed the squirrels. Never got a selfie though.
Someone else’s grandpa feeds chipmunks by hand! Mine used to when he was able and I always thought it was like a one of a kind chipmunk
That’s awesome!
Who is the old guy with him?
Grandma's cute.
He’s doing it right.
Yo that’s alvins dad
r/godzillawhenhesees
Hey, not trying to be “that guy” but I want to remind you and everyone else with a grandpa to tell that man you love him. Hug him, if you can. 

My grandpas are many years gone and I still miss the hell out of them.
Ok this is pure gold
Your grandpa is a squirrel?
Stay healthy my man stay healthy
I have come across this image like 10x today and this is the first time I noticed the chipmunk!
THE CHEEKS
I love this !
We should make a r/grandparentselfie
Old people are magic
Is your grandpa currently accepting new granddaughters? 🤣🤣🤣
My grandpa used to take selfies too on the tablet we bought him. I miss him so much.
BEAST MASTER!
That chipmunks cheeks look ready for winter
E
what a savage
Whoa. I saw the top half of this picture like three different times before scrolling down and seeing the chipmunk😂
I thought chipmunks were much smaller..
"Wait, your taking a photo? I'm not ready!"
Grandpa is a cool ass dude.
This has completely made my day. Thank you for sharing!
I dare anyone who has a better first selfie to come forward, don’t think it exists!
How’d he get a chipmunk? Lucky
So cuteeee
tell your grandpa he just won the internet
Wholesome
Good thing a little doxycycline can clean up that plague right away.

I love you grandpa, and I love his squirrel buddy. So. Much.
They have the same cheeks, lol. :)
Nice rat you got there.
Your pop-pop is a Disney princess?
I can sense a hint of a smile on the left corner of his mouth. I‘d guess he has served in a number of wars?
AAAAAAALVIIIIIINNNN
Holy shit. This guy just pulled a Kareem abdul-Jabbar! Makes his selfie debut and just absolutely kills it.
Your grandpa’s cool as fuck!
Wow I've probably taken about 500 of myself but haven't been able to capture such a badass one
And he doesn’t know what a selfie is but he figured it out all by himself!
Chipmunks are attracted to dying people
That squirrel is double cheeked up
A Disney princess all along
Are the chipmunks cheeks Full or just like that always?!!?!
He's our grandpa now
this is adorable!!!
Chipmunk is new favorite grandchild ;D.
This is so goals, man i wanna grow up this good
So chill. Man...he's a super star! Great grampa! A nice human being overall. Whild animals know...
I appreciate you uploading this! Makes me feel great to be living on the same time with this wonderful man!
What is going on with all these grandpa selfies? Did people realize they can get karma by texting their grandfathers and asking them to take a picture of themselves real quick?
Does your grandpa always pose with random humans?
Super cute picture. I like the human who photobombed you Grandpa‘s picture as well.
God op this is so cute!<3 if you have anymore please post them.

Its so cute your grandpa has lil chipmunk friends.
His first selfie and already he’s better than all of us
What a sweet man.
Good for you grandpa.
I love when old guys take their first selfies, it always looks like they forgot how to smile without being prompted lol
He looks like that chipmunk just stole his acorns and he's about to get them back.
Awesome

Really nice picture of the 2 .🥰😍
By the look at those cheeks that ain’t no random occurrence!

2 questions :

How does a squirrel operate a phone?

Who is the old man with your grandpa?
Hehehe chubby cheeks
Bro your grqndpa is so smol.
And he got that nice old man to help him take it.
“With” his new phone... For some reason, I understood that as “next to” his own phone, meaning the chipmunk was the phone.
One photo and I know. Your grandpa is a good man. FACT.
This guy finally unlocked beast mode, in the squirrel kingdom :-)
Wow, looks like he got verizon tech support to make a house call
I hate to break it to you, but that's not a phone. It's a squirrel.
Why is he on top of an old man?
He didn’t have to stunt like that
this needs to be framed and signed by him
This has to be so awesome can he write a guide to becoming friends with squirrels and stuff?
He got the lip action right
Him and his side kick, adorable!!! ❣️
I already see the other comments but still need to make mine...

Does he know there's a squirrel on his shirt chock full of food?
Your gramps is a Disney princess.
Which one's your grandpa
He flexed that hard on the first try?

Your grandpa looks really nice! But who the heck is that old guy in the picture?

Ok, that squirrel is not like the squirrels in my area.

Grandpa needs to share his secrets to get adorable animals to stay and chill with him. Both are adorable!

So freaking adorable!! Is this the same grandpa from the other day that took a selfie on his iPad and emailed to someone 3 times? 🥰
Everybody’s got something to hide except for me and my chipmunk.

Get all of those OMg cUTe seLFIE!!!!11!! out of here! Except you, you can stay gramps!
Your grandpa is cute, whose the guy behind your grandpa tho?
My Pappaw and I raised a chipmunk I took away from the barn cats.  Didn't have cell phones with cameras in those days so I don't have any pictures.  This picture reminds me of him.  At one time, he had a red squirrel and a crow that he'd rehabilitated.  Years later, my mom would collect different nuts from the trees  in our woods.  She'd dole out the nuts from autumn to spring.  She felt sorry for the animals who got the black walnuts because of how thick the shells were.  So she'd Crack the shells.  Then she felt guilty about no cracking the other nuts.  Soon the squirrels  would not take the non-cracked nuts.  Dad had to hide the hammers and pipe wrenches from her to get her to stop.  Next thing, squirrels  invaded the garage, to get at the nuts and the sacks of horse feed.  From there, they got into the attic and started chewing the electrical  wire.  That is why you should not feed the wildlife.
The grandpa poker face.
I'm admiring the way you have completely glossed over the fact there's a chipmunk just chilling like a villain here, but more importantly your gramps' first selfie. I dig it
Applecore!
Our friendship was supposed to be a secret Steve!
Awwwwwwww
Hi grandpa! Good job being a friend to that cheeky squirrel!
When I grown old, I want to be a person like your grandpa, life goal: chilling With Chipmunks !
Grandpa “Aww nuts”  chipmunk “Where?  I thought I got em all!”
