My friends had a labrador who would climb out of their bedroom window, along a ledge, up a pitched roof, jump down onto a flat roof.  

From there he'd jump onto the neighbours garage roof and then fling himself off the roof using their bagged rubbish as an airbag.  Because he'd manage to split all their bags open, he'd eat every scrap of edible, and inedible, food they had thrown out.
"Huck, where are you?"     
"ROOF"    
"Cool, dinner at six"

No foolin'.
My dog sat on the roof of his doghouse all the time and just chilled up there.  He wouldn't go in it, ever, but he loved sitting on top of it.

Edit: It was before digital cameras, so it's not great, but [here is my dog on his roof](http://i.imgur.com/9DLhqEH.jpg).  It's the only one I could find, I wish I had one of him sitting, it always looked so awkward.
Ayo- thanks for sharing my post! I saw this pup this morning on my walk and it made my day. There are a couple of other photos of him!

When I was young my parents had a border collie and when it rained she would sit in the rain at this one corner of the yard, like almost every time it rained she'd go outside on purpose, run to that corner, and just sit there and get soaked in the rain staring at the street corner with a very 'sad' or vacant expression on her face. 

My Mom had so many people come up to our door demanding we get a dog house or bring the dog inside that she put a similar sign something like 

> 'Lily has a dog house, and there's also a dog door where she can come inside our home whenever she wants. She ENJOYS sitting in the rain please do not feel the need to come tell us, she does this very often. Feel free to pet her through the chain link fence.'
The real updog.
Thanks for posting this! Huck's owner here!

u mean wooftops tho... right?
I love when people have to put signs up for the odd behaviors of their pets.
In Mexico, having a dog on the roof is common. No joke. 
Dogspotting !!
Was this the dog from that post about a dog that had shingles? 
It's a good thing they don't have a pet elephant.
\#hucktheroofdog

*He has his own hashtag*
This same thing happens with my roof cat! We have people knocking on our door often, very alarmed, very convinced that she can't get herself down from the second story roof. But she effectively lives up there, eschewing land for the view and what I assume must be a cozy spot up against the chimney. She comes down to eat and poop and pee and then she's right back up, alarming citizens yet again. I should post a sign. 
Hilarious, but some hysterical harpy is going to get the authorities involved.
Squirrels stand no chance, now. 
I mean, it's still not super safe for the dog. I would be worried if my dog is constantly getting on to the roof, for the same reason I make sure the windows are closed when he's in the back seat of my car.
I had a Jack Russell that would climb trees- neighbors would call and say: why is your tree barking?!? Best dog ever.

I LOVE THIS ROOFER PUP
Huck is the patron saint of /r/dogsonroofs/
Huck gives no fucks!
I'll be your Huckleberry
I like the stone work on that house.
This sort of thing is pretty normal on Latin America. Roofs on houses tend to be flat rather then sloped and they can stand guard better. Probably not ideal for the well being of the animal but that's how it is there; they're seen as more utilitarian 
[deleted]
Huckleberry may be the hero we need but we don't deserve him.
Does his nickname happen to be "Fiddler"?
I'm really disappointed that I can't find more pictures of Hucktheroofdog 😔
When my now 11 year old dog was about a year old, my son and a friend were on the roof fixing something. Our dog climbed out a window and joined them. My son turned around and there he was just chillin' on the roof.
Here boye where are you?? 

Roof.
What a winner of a dog.

I won't knock on your door, but don't be surprised if you look up and see me petting him.
That dog identifies as a cat.

Reminds me of the Bruges dog - Fidel.  My wife and I saw him while there on vacation - then found out he was kind of famous.

Sadly - I just looked him up again - and he died in January.  
RIP Fidel.
Must be a Korean Retriever. 
If a dogs gonna dog he's gonna do it from highest vantage point. Sight lines let a dog dog at highest dog levels. 
That's going to be one sad dog when he gets old and can't make it up anymore.
Roof floof
This doggo does the roofing around here 
#DON'T BE ALARMED!!!
I asked Huckleberry, "what's on top of the house?" He said, "roof".
> feel free to take pictures of him and share with the world

...and so he did.

He thought the other dogs were saying **roof** instead of **woof** 😂
When I was a kid, about 3 years old, I remember a house down the street from my grandparents that had three Rottweilers that apparently lived on the roof of their owner's house. I'd always be so scared of walking by, thinking they'd jump off the roof and attack me. I always thought it was quite bizzare. Good times... 
I'm just thinking about the damage to those shingles.
I've got a roof dog in my neighborhood but he's black so the pictures never turn out well
I love the formal announcement to concerned citizens.
Funny that this was actually taken from Facebook and posted here instead of the other way around.
Watch_dog
My uncles dog did the same exact thing. Would hop up on a low part in the back yard then move to the front so it looked trapped up there. Absolutely loved being on the roof. 
I guess he likes it on the roof because he wants to feel tall.
my goldie looks almost identical...just a lot more red 
this is definitely a goldie thing to do
It's the view !
Huck the Roof Dog is here to fix your woof.
Come on! 3 hours late and nobody has brought up snoopy? I'm dissapointed...

He likes the way those shingles feel on his ass.
Roof dog won't leave the roof 
It's over hoomans, I have the high ground.
That's cute but I bet he poops up there. 
He is the king of the world.

Throw that dog a pizza
he's a woofdog
There's definitely a joke to be found involving "roof korean" and "roof dog" but I'm not sure what it would be.
he looks so bummed that the sign has ruined his fun. 
So many people are using the hashtag but just posting the exact same pictures as the one OP posted, some of them even claiming they're the ones who took them smh
I laughed so hard I cried, because this is the first bit of joy I've felt in weeks and fuck am I unhappy. 

But this made me laugh, I won't think farther than that.

One time, when I was delivering pizza, I could hear barking, but I couldn't see any dogs. Finally, I looked up.

That hashtag is one letter away from being very, very illegal.
Huckleberry doesnt seem to be as into it anymore from when the poster pic was taken. 
Hahaha I love this. My old golden loved the roof! She was also nuts her entire life and never slowed down till about age 13. We had to build blocks on our deck so she wouldn't jump up and accidentally fall off 
Honestly, one of the main reasons I would ever want to own a home is so that I can sit on the roof. There's something really nice about being on top of a house that you just can't get with a balcony...
#hucktheroofdog

I mean this is just bad training right?
I think the responsible thing to do would be to enact measures aimed to prohibit the dogs access to the roof. This is cute and all but the dog is going to get seriously hurt one day.
"It's over, Anakin..."
I'm late to the party, but I have a specific memory of a dog on a roof. We had a really nasty mean bus driver in high school who had just finished pulling over and yelling at us for something. We started driving again and the bus was pretty silent still. I noticed a dog on the roof and yelled it out loud. Everyone on the bus jumped up and ran to the other side of the bus. I kid you not, the fucker almost flipped over. I didn't mean to cause that much ruckus. I was just really excited about that dog on a roof. 

If I remember correctly I got kicked off that particular bus and had to ride the other one from then on. 
Roofer doggo
TIL that some people seem to think that the words "roof" and "woof" rhyme.

Edit: For those that are downvoting me, this was a lighthearted comment. I am also pointing out that I learned something, so no need to correct me :)

For the record:

* I pronounce "roof" (that keeps a house dry) to rhyme with "goof".

* I spell the sound that a dog makes as "ruff" or "woof".

* I come from New Zealand.

Edit 2,3,4...: I am bad at formatting
OP put his dog on roof for karma. 

Smh
\# huck hero of dog ?

strange hashtag
I can't believe they missed the opportunity to say #hucktheroofwoof
There is an AA group called, "Dogs on a Roof".    

It is called that because they held the meeting in the garage and when ever they set up the garage for the meeting, the dog would go up on the roof.    

So. If you saw the dog on the roof, you knew there was a meeting going on.    

That's the way I heard it.
Living up to his name?  Are Huckleberries associated with roofs? 
He musta thought it was a hot tin roof
Compared to the cow on a roof, this seems quite normal
Huck does not look amused in one pic but overly excited in the other

"jump onto" meaning "slowly walk up the series of 50 foot ramps that crisscross our entire back yard."  

That dog doesn't look young enough or adventurous enough to be jumping anywhere these days.

I used to get phone calls from our neighbor that our dog was on their roof again.  Scary, but also funny.
This dog could be trained to sit on a lower surface he just likes to have the vantage point so he can protect his domain.
Just like drunk college kids lol
I mean, I've seen a horse do that multiple times. 

It's probably just a collision mesh problem, should be fixed in the next patch with the Crossbow DLC.

I dunno, seems pretty harmless, but as a dog owner myself I wouldn't risk letting my dog up on the roof and would probably figure out a way to prevent him from potentially seriously hurting himself because I think it's cute.

In the picture on the right, the dog looks like "guys! I got on the roof, look at me!." In the picture on the left he's all like "...guys? It's been six hours, can I please come down now?" 
This and the guy strolling his dog at the store made today great.
Aww Huckleberry you..

This reminds me of when my brother and his friend climbed onto the town's elementary school and rollerbladed (I'm dating myself here) on the roof. In broad daylight. And got arrested. 

That was my dad's worst Father's Day ever.

When I went to Mexico, my friend and I started playing "Dog Watch", which is exactly what it sounds like. We were in the van and would call out "Dog Watch 12..." or whatever. 

Suddenly, my friend is stuttering, "r-r-roof! Roof Dog!!!" And we all turn and there's this big pupper up top! So then, the game turned into "Roof Dog Watch." We got into the 30s. Apparently, it's super common over there to have your dog on the roof. At least where we were.

I had to make a chicken wire fence and place it on my roof strategically because my husky climbs up to greet the mailman. I can't tell you how many times the police have shown up at my door and just say, "Shadow's on the roof again. I'm sure you know, but because they called, I have to show up."

Sadly dogs should not be jumping off anything too high, I have a small minpin that's back/spine is jacked from jumping off the couch so much. Sorry to be a killjoy but it's true. 
Oh my goodness, this is the best thing I have ever seen! 
My dog can't jump onto my bed. :/
A dog in my town is like this, but with a fence and whatever is by it instead of a house.
Terrified me the first time I saw it. 😅
They moved away in like 2008 or something, but someone in my neighbourhood had a dog who did the exact same thing. They eventually re-shingled their roof, which kept the dog grounded. I don't know if the new roof was slippery or something, I just know it was blue.
I had a dog that did this regularly after my dad built a two story barn with an attached deck in my back yard.   The mailman hated her, but people would stop and take pictures of her standing there wagging her tail, practically every week.  She even made the local paper.
Haha that's awesome 
My cat does this.  No one cares
Thats a cat 
My neighbors have a big rott. that does this all the time, but doesn't know how to get dowm.

Lol
There is a dog like that just down the street from my place. At first, I was very concerned but now every time I walk but I just see him chilling up there.
Of course it's Gallowboob
He shoul really get the huck off the roof

There's a German Shepherd in my neighborhood that does this. Sits on the very edge of the roof and walks along the edge when I walk by. Used to scare the crap out of me because I'm walking with my toddler and baby, but one day it jumped down and loped over and sniffed me and kept walking. So now I know it's a nice dog and not worried anymore.
Lol, this is just awesome. \^\^
This looks a lot like a house in Austin, TX I used to walk my dogs by all the time.  There was always at least one dog up there barking at us.
Pet Health Warning:

Do not 'huck' roof dogs.
Haha this dog is the cutest thing I'll see today.
My dog did the same shit.  We had a exterior back staircase that went near the garage and he would crawl under the handrail and into our garage roof.  He loved it.  Kept watch over things.

I saw a bunch of roof dogs in Cuba too. It's like a normal thing there. Pretty cute <3
Used to have a dog who we had a flat roof dog house for, he almost never actually went in the thing, instead he would sleep on top of it, even in the rain or snow.
I think this might be the most unique dog story I've ever learned about.
STANDING ON THE ROOFTOP EVERYBODY BARK YOUR HEARTTTTT OUTTTT
笑死了
My neighbor's dog likes the roof, too.

When you're sitting on roof rn. Wish I had that doge 
Saw [this](https://imgur.com/gallery/Ylo7p) in Puerto Rico once. I guess it's a dog thing.
I love the picture on the flier. It should just say "DON'T BE ALARMED!!!"
He's just a dog that likes to get high!
Highest vantage point, smart doggo
Wooftop fetish
This is very likely my favorite reddit post ever.

I raise you another dog!
He is a silent guardian. A dark protector. A dog knight.
Best thing I've seen on reddit.... I've seen it all now .. bloody roof pooch ... 
This is just beautiful 
I've had with these motherfucking dogs on these motherfucking roofs!
I've been looking for a reliable roofer!
Snoopy?!
Best dog ever! Made my day!
Roof dogs, porch toads, attic eagles, garage raccoons...
Neighborhood Watch-dog
But is this true though??? The hashtag on twitter only goes back as old as this post is:..
Very nice stone work.
Get ready for some selfie videos of him barking Russian and playing around on the edge of the roof.
This is awesome, #hucktheroofdog just would like to do what all humans want to do....see more life!
I can't even get my golden to jump into my car...
This is the cutest thing i have ever seen!!!!!
Woah, the owners have probably had quite a few comments by now to make that sign and explanation :)
What a good doggo
R O O F B O Y E
Aww, We have two golden doodles named Huck and Finn
Austin, TX?
My cat used to do this all the time too. She was afraid of the other neighbourhood cats and felt being on the roof kept her out of harms way.  Lol
#Hucktheroofdog
He likes to take the high ground.
Someone's been watching The Lion King. 
Knowing he's out there chilling on a roof makes me so happy. We have roof cats at our apartment. They are so fun!
I once knew a family that had a similar dog.  The local newspaper had a shot of him and called it something cheesy like, "up on the woof-top."  Interestingly, said dog was also a large male golden retreiver.  Ostensibly these are bird dogs.  Why some of them like roofs is anyone's guess. In any event, they are a kindly breed by nature, generally inclined to like everyone they meet.  
"what are you doing up there boy? No, I know where you are but, why are up there?
My aunts dog used to do the same thing, too funny 
"I'm a roof dog now"
I'm a roof baby now!
Goldens are so fucking cute. 
This just seems like a terrible idea :c    Some idiot is going to try to get the dog to jump off on purpose.  People are douches.
Thanks for making me laugh at the gym 👍
Roof
Great. For a moment I thought the hashtag says #fucktheroofdog.
#hucktheroofdog
Is this in Denton, Tx?? There is (was?) a house there where two dogs had access to the roof from the backyard and would bark at people going by.... Pretty cool
My neighbors golden figured out that he could jump up onto the back of the garage roof and escape through the front. The electric fence wouldn't go off and he'd cruise the neighborhood until someone brought him home or they realized he had escaped again. Gorgeous looking golden too but my god he's a spaz. 
His name is Huck the Roof Dog.
I like how they are hip with the hash tags 
Roofee 
Me too thanks
He's Ezio's dog
Can this please be the first 100K upvote post I have ever seen, because huck the roof dog is pretty good
YOUR ALL CAPS IS ALARMING MEEE!!!!!!
Snoopy?
Crazy dog! But funny!
Posted this morning on dogspotting on Facebook. Definitely join the group!

Boy did I read the hashtag at the end wrong.
I guess you could say he's an expert roofer. 
Im a roof baby now
Am I the only one who thinks it would just be easier to prevent him from jumping on the roof? Since he can be enticed by food, ball, who knows what else? 
I had a small dog that would climb on our roof and someone decided to call animal control and thatmother fucker had the nerve to walk into my house while we were gone. He gave us a fine and we got in trouble. But let some ass hole decides to enter a place that he shouldnt be. His defense was that the door was unlocked. Wtf.
How does he get down
My nana coated dog biscuits in icing for a birthday party. About 5 people came up to her asking for the recipe.
Why wouldn't you just fix the spot where he is getting up on the roof?? I mean just because the dog likes it up there doesn't mean it's right for him to be up there. He could easily get injured then hashtag huckster roofdog isn't so funny anymore.

"hmm i could potentially eliminate the source of how the dog is able to get on my roof....or print out flyers and post them all around my property...."


So fucking sad that the people in the US are such fucking busybodies that a dog owner has to post something like this.
This dog may can fly, Otherwise how it is possible?
The fact that you can entire The doggo off a 12 foot roof with just a yellow squishy ball kills me
Is this in Austin?! If this is in Austin I've seen this dog.    
(#)hucktheroofdog

They wanted him to be internet phamous. I bet they trained him. And posted this photo!
