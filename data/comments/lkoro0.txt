If dogs could talk, the wisdom would be unmatched

I see the onlyfans style titles like “To ThE tEn pEOpLE WhO sEE ThIS” are making their way to the mainstream.
To the 10? Lol
As an owner of a ten year old dog this makes me happy and breaks my heart. 
Love them as much as possible while they’re around.
Low pixel or oil painting, you decide...
pogdog
You are on r/aww you will get more than 10 people...
Sooo fluffy! :D
Sigh.

Was #11.

Got locked out.
r/aww has almost 30,000,000 followers. Adding a clause like that to the title feels like panhandling for votes.
“To the 10 people” blah blah blah fuck off.
Can we ban these titles like many other subs do?
I downoted this clickbait bullshit and did my part
My childhood golden passed away last summer at age 13. Best friend in my entire world. May you have many more years of cuddles, playing, and just her presence
To the 10 people that see this, please stop using the "For the 10 people that see this" pseudo guilt trip title.
Looks like she is mid sneeze
At first I only saw a small thumbnail of this picture and I thought it was a lion. It's just a majestic looking golden!
I despise titles like this
Is she on a rope?
Needs a hair cut
Too many 10s in this post
I think it's our duty as good Redditors to downvote any post that starts with "to the 10 people who see this".
[removed]
Sure he / she has been a great buddy 😃
How did this get 100k upvotes
He's just performing an ocular patdown of the mailman!
She looks a bit like the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz. I’ll bet she has a heart, all right!
Im not sure but i think that there are more than 10 people that saw this
Dogs give unconditional love. It’s just a shame their humans don’t reciprocate. You need to take him to a groomer, get all of his painful mats removed, get his vaccines and heart worm treatment up to date, and then bring him INSIDE the house when it’s cold outside so his arthritis doesn’t flare up. He looks like a sweet boy, and doesn’t deserve to be chained/cabled up alone in the yard.
It's a dog, it is a picture of a dog. Why does this have so many upvotes? It is a dog. There are far cuter things on this sub that don't get this many upvotes. It's a dog. Just a dog.
What's up with these title's lately and people acting like nobody would ever care about their old pets? Isn't it pretty clearly established that humans in general, and especially on social media, really love pets? Especially good older floof's like this.

There's clearly been a trend this last week of people posting pictures of their elderly pets, and that's awesome! Personally, I love it.
But that title really feels pandering; *'to the 10 people who see this'*? You're posting a beautiful old dog on r/aww , Even posts only 10 minutes old have over 10 upvotes. 

You're clearly aware of the trend OP, because your jumping on the bandwagon, no need to guilt trip us.

There are 28 million people subbed, with over 35K online right now, it's almost *literally* impossible for less than 10 people to see something posted here.

I mean it clearly worked but I think it's a bit odd (And lets be honest, pretty pathetic) to try so hard to make people feel bad for you so you can get more visibility. It's like begging people for attention. Literally.
Jesus, groom him sometime.

Maybe he is going to sneeze, or maybe he is going to fart

And he is beautiful!

That old boy looks like he has some tales to tell. Just needs some spectecles and a rocking chair.
no I think like 77,000 people saw this I may be wrong because I can’t count
Is this the result of breeding a golden retriever to a lion?
Why are all of this persons comments getting downvoted lol
he is extra fluffy, kinda looks like a golden bear :). give him a brush!
*Lion with a shaved head
I think that's a bear
Have been there, watching a dear friend age faster than me and hating it. Our veterinarian gave us the advice to "count each day as a bonus day" when one of our dogs received a terminal diagnosis.  But its a good quote for all of us to remember that time spent with those we love while they/we are here is how our time is best spent.

Excuse me sir or madam, that a Bearwolf not a dog
My cat is on his last days too but he's getting every second of love he fiercely demands from me.
She’s a queen

I thought that was a really skinny lion at first.
You are very lucky. I’m putting mine down tomorrow due to cancer. Please give your dog a hug.
I’ve also had a dog for 10 years! Since I was 10 🤣
She’s a beaut
Thought it was a Lion at first.
Posting a cute animal on Reddit and thinking only 10 people will see it. lul!
“To ThE 10 PeOpLe WhO WiLl SeE tHiS” bullshit you’re dog is adorable and you know it. 

This was meant to be a compliment before anyone gets mad
I’m more of a cat person

Yo! Looks like a Golden Retriever my favorite dog was a Golden Retriever. Rest in Peace Maxwell!! he was also very protective which is unusual for a Golden Retriever... but anyway yeah buddy of mines father had a pit and ole Max tore him up. I got respect for all animals I'm just saying... Man I miss my Max
I didn't know that dog/lion hybrids were real.

Nuts frozen to the porch?
10 people, huh? I bet you didn’t expect it to get THIS much attention.
He looks like he's in the middle of a dad joke.
She looks like she’s telling long, drawn out stories about what the sticks and squirrels were like when she was a puppy. Back in the day, before there were things like chewy dot com and crates.￼
If it was my “pupper” I would give him a good brushing daily,  long walk daily, and annual vet visit.
10 years is a very long time, what a privilege to have such a great best friend
No sir that is a lion
What is it to everybody who aren’t those 10 people

Good boy.
Treat that magnificent beast to a groom day. He/she deserves it.

There’s an old line...a guy licks his wife and his dog in the trunk of his car and let’s them out two hours later. Guess which one’s happy to see him?
Lovely pupper

OP, your dogs needs to see the groomer! Lots of matted hair on the poor guy/girl. Matted hair can be painful and cause skin issues! Please consider going to the vet for dematting.
Only here for Schnoodle poems and doggo pictures. OP clickbait and not walking dog, boooo
That's a lion wtf you talking about
Ah yes, Dog Bear.

Are you sure you didnt get a lion by mistake?
Please do not be alarmed, but I think your dog may actually be a very clever bear.
Such a sweet one! Golden dogs of all breeds seem to be the bestest friends.. ❤️
Same, my girl is not doing well. Maybe a month if god grants her enough time. Pancreatitis and she can’t keep water down and diabetic. Losing weight daily. I paid for it out of my pocket so I don’t need anything. I’m really glad the community helped this guy out.
Gorgeous boi.
I am getting major Sabretooth (X-Men) vibes from him

Good dog.
My wife has promised me another golden when we finally have a house.  She has seen me struggle to hold back tears talking about my golden boy.  

I hope you get at least another 5 years out of this golden pupper.
Can't belive anyone hasn't said it before but that is not a dog, that is a mutated lion/bear.

"Get off my lawn!" (Dog, probably). (Also, she is lovely, BTW)
Great doggo
So sorry she has to be chained up. But if it’s for her safety you have to do what you have to do. Give her a kiss on the top of her head for me. Thanks
Nice dog!
