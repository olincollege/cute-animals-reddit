One time I was riding my bike back home and saw a kitty cross the street. He/she meowed and another cat came out of the bushes. Then they both set off on their next adventure. One of the cutest things I've ever seen.
And they said chivalry was dead.
Well? Where's the picture of Ralph and his friend? It's like you don't even know us, u/franwalker26.
Meanwhile my cat doesn't get along with any of the neighborhood cats. Fucks them up and chases them the second he gets eyes on them. What does he hang out with? The fucking raccoons and possums. He's just sitting there while a few baby raccoons just tear through my trash.

Edit: I was given gold for my asshole cat, Thanks.
I feel that face is the cat equivalent of "yes sir, I'll have her back by 9, I promise."
Cat crews, man, they're real. My cats used to meet up with a neighbor cat everyday just to go beat up some other cat crew on the other side of the block. Eventually someone's cat went missing. They suspected a fisher cat. I didn't snitch.

"Maaaa! I'm gonna go play with Ralph!!"
Such a friendly neighborhood kitty.
Aww, what a patient kitty.
We let our cat out to play with the neighbors cats! He loves them. I make sure to vaccinate him from Rabies and Feline Leukemia virus and give him flea/tick/heartworm preventative, just in case. 
I've written about this before.  We had a neighbor cat, Mojo, that would visit every day.  She'd hang out on our porch most afternoons.  My little dog, Stella, was so happy to have a friend visit, and would spend the next few hours fetching various toys, and bringing them to Mojo to play with.  

But Mojo was just using Stella.  She only came to visit because our porch got afternoon sun.  After a few hours, I'd look out, and there would be Mojo, sleeping in the sun, surrounded by all of Stella's toys.  Which Mojo was ignoring.  Along with Stella.
Cats are funny. 
Please tell me you cat name is Sam  
.. morning Ralph, morning Sam
Kitty next door? By the laws of every teen, romance and/or romantic comedy film I've ever seen, your cat is destined to marry him. (After a long stint and near-engagement to the wrong kitty, of course.) 
"So Ralph what intentions do you have with our daughter " - cats father
There used to be a black squirrel that would come to my house everyday to play with our cat. He would wait on the porch everyday for us to let our cat and they would play tag all day running up and down the street. Cat died. Squirrel would still come. Everyday he would be at our door. Eventually he would scratch at the door trying to get our attention. It was so sad. Eventually he stopped coming and looked so depressed.
I usually let my cat out as she's originally a stray. She has joined a clique of cats on my side of the street and they chase away cats from the other side of the street. She also has a little boyfriend cat who lives behind me. Funny little community of outdoor cats. I've always had outdoor cats and am aware of the risks.

Edit: Spelled clique like a donk.
I like Ralph. 
In Ralph's mind, OP is a terrible person who just has his cat friend hostage. 
My cat Bronn also has a friend who picks him up every day. His name is Maximo. One day, Maximo didn't show up. And then for the next four days Maximo didn't drop by. Bronn was so worried he'd go out and wander while meowing really loudly. 

On the fifth day, Maximo shows up looking all clean and fluffy. Turns out one of our neighbors kind of adopted him and he was in a food coma for days.

Now they both have happy homes, but they still always go on adventures every afternoon.

Maximo doesn't want to live with us because we have a dog. But I'm so glad he'd still visit Bronn every day. 
When I was a kid I followed my cat Puff on her daily patrol outside.  I was very careful, quiet, and it took about two hours.

I followed her as she fished for minnows in the ditch/creek that surrounded the property, taunted the dogs in the neighbor's fenced yard, slunk through the small wooded areas between neighborhoods.  I followed her through a construction area of a housing development as she greeted some of the people who had just moved in, and informed other pets, both small dogs and cats, that this was *her* domain and they'd better respect the queen or else.  Lots of tail flirting and preening, not much overt threat.  She had poise baby.  I followed her as she inspected the old, slowly-decaying buses abandoned in an empty section of the school, and as she stalked bluejays next to the soccer field.

Finally, after a couple of hours of being super quiet, cautious and crouching behind bushes, down in ditches and behind trees, I hear her distinctive "MrRowow" she always used to call her kittens.  Sure enough, she's looking right at where I'm hiding.  She just stands there, her tail periodically giving a twitch, until I step out of hiding.

"Meh." she says, then flirts her tail and starts making a direct line for our house, a few blocks away.  She led me home, then as she reached the door she waited for me.  Purring she rubbed my leg, as if to let me know she was proud of me and here endeth the lesson on 'stalking'.

My cat was like my second mom.
I do the same thing when I go to my buddies house to collect him for our weekly bar walk. Turns out it's not cute but creepy when I do it and now his wife won't let him hang out with me anymore. :(
Classic Ralph, such a ladies cat. 
Ok. And a pic of your cat? Prove you have a üêà!!! 
[removed]
I love human names on pets for some reason.  If I ever get a dog or cat, i'm naming him "Carl" or "George."  "Oh your cat is so cute... is he named Whiskers? or Frisky?  Nope... Carl.
Watch out for the very real possibility of FeLV or FIV

Aww he's adorable! 
Who's a good boy?
My wife and I have 7 cats and they are quite the clan. Our neighbor just got a new kitten and I have never seen anything like what is going on. All 7 of my cats are enamored by this kitten. They have all taken turns cuddling with it, playing with it, exploring with it, etc. Every morning I've found this kitten teaming up with a new buddy. 
Hopefully your cat is male or fixed. Otherwise prepare for baby Ralphs. 
Who said the cat he was waiting on was a girl? He may be waiting on his buddy. I bet they find a small dog and take turns slapping it
That's the cutest fucking thing I've seen all week. I needed this. Thank you for posting. 
My husband's cat doesn't get along with other cats, but he did tell me about a time when she came home with this white cat in tow. She stayed the night, and my husband fed her and named her Snow. She only came by that one night, and it was the only time his cat brought another cat home. I like to think Snow accidentally got locked out of her own house for the night and hub's cat was all, "I got you, girl. Come with me." 
My first cat had a neighborhood cat friend too
Let's go loser, we're gonna do tomcat shit 
I have a stray cat, Scar, that always sits on my backyard porch. We have sliding glass doors by our kitchen so we always see him just sitting there chilling. The creepy thing is he always watches my cats eat. My cats will be inside all snuggly getting fed and there's Scar just watching them, yearning for food. My parents refused to feed him because they didn't want to encourage him to stay but he's always there I mean for months. So eventually my parents said alright fuck it well feed him semi regularly. So he won. But he always just watches my cats eat. I think it's hilarious but my parents say it's really creepy. 

Tl;dr a stray cat scar always watches my cats eat everyday. Just sitting outside. Watching. I love him 
Now let's see your cat OP

^or^maybe^this^is^your^cat...
Ralph fucks your cat.
I can't believe that the cats actually play well together. My cat would be trying to jump through the door at Ralph.
We had a kitty that would come through the doggy door. We dubbed her Ms.Kitty. One time we found her with a chip bag on hers  head and fell in love. We fed her, took her to the vet and loved her. One day she broke her leg so we went to fit her for a pink cast. Come to find out HIS name was Burt and lived across the street. Met his human and he thanked us for loving him so much. It was sweet. I miss Burt.
One of my cats used to be indoor/outdoor till we moved. I used to go walk with him, just to see what he'd get into, and everytime he would walk by the other apartments with cats and stop to socialize with them all. Cats are a lot more sociable then a lot of people realize. 
Have you noticed your cat's behavior change recently?
Does Ralph determine when and where they can play?
Has she been acting different?
Does she seem to meow less?
Has she come home with bruises or scratches?
Your cat might be the victim of an abusive relationship!
If that's the case, call 1-800-MEOW-NOW

So what you're saying is that you have an outdoor cat and indoor cat? 
Kitty adventures! I always wanted to put a gopro or something of the like on my kitty just to see what happens in her day.
Does this remind anyone else of Chi's Sweet Home? The one with the play date?

http://www.crunchyroll.com/chis-sweet-home-chis-new-address/episode-21-chi-goes-outside-528630
pics of them playing?
Please post a pic or two of Ralph and your cat getting into some shenanigans.
Do you ask him to drop her off before 11:00 pm and no alcohol ?
"playtime"...yep, thats what they are doing.
I have a social cat- he has convinced my grouchy hermit cat to play every day.  He sits by the back door and calls the outdoor cat, then comes to get me when she's at the door waiting to be let in to eat.  He nursed another cat through hospice. When he's one taking care of all the other cats, he wanders around lonely.  If it wouldn't make me a crazy cat lady, I'd go adopt a friend for him.
Prove it, prove the cat is there every day.
Ralph is a stud. 
First of all Ralph is adorable! Second he looks fluffy and Third I appreciate how clean everything looks in this picture
We had this little ginger kitty that lived on our street, and he would come to the door looking for our big ginger kitty, Erik.  They'd run off together and hang out all day.  I like to think that little orange kitty wanted to apprentice to Erik so he could be a big-ass mega orange bastard just like his hero.
Ralph's fucking your cat, just look at him.
Cats are pretty awesome. When they choose to be. 
I had a Russian blue adopt a black persian kitten recently.
My other kittens origionally adopted the Russian blue.
I'd be in my garden feeding them and the russian blue would be hiding, she eventually stopped being so nervous because she followed the other cats lead and now she's doing the same.
I wish my cats would stop fostering cats but what can you do.


Before my husband married he had a dog named Elvis. Every day the cat from the apartment down the hall would come get Elvis so they could go play. This cat wasn't very people friendly as she'd never let us pet her.  But she'd walk right on in and search his apartment to find Elvis. Cutest thing ever!
I had a cat named Tigger (because he would bounce when he was happy) that would do this. He would go across the street to hang out with the neighbor's cat, and their cat would come over inside our house to hang out with him. In the evening we'd have to show the neighbor's cat to the door and Tigger would mope because his friend was gone.
Invite him in for some noms with your cat! :D
[deleted]
Even cats need a friend :)
I have a Ralph but he's much fatter, and lazier and his breath smells like cat food. 
This is some Ghibli movie stuff.... I love it
this is me at prettygirl's house before mobile Phones
üê± Meowllo. Can kitty come out to play? 
I need a Ralph.  I need a cat to come collect me for playtime everyday!
She's spayed :)
Why is it that when I saw this the first thing I thought was what happens when your cat dies and then Ralph just sits there outside your house for years waiting for her like Seymour in Futurama :(
[deleted]
If Ralph is ferile make sure you keep your cat's vaccines up to date. He could transmit diseases or fleas to your cat.
Ralph is gonna knock up your cat.
Aww your cat has a boyfrieeennddd~~
Can a cat be a gud boye? If they can, that one certainly counts.
This is wonderful!

My cat had a friend who would come around every evening and they would scamper around the backyard and play.   The family moved though.    My cat also goes to the side fence and calls for the dog who lives next door, and then they sniff noses and chill next to each other on the opposite side of the fence.   I'm thinking about getting a second cat so he has a permanent buddy.
Does he have a owner?
Awww! He looks like such a good patient polite kitty. 
Get your cat checked for feline AIDS
>My cat's breath smells like cat food.

-Ralph
Ralph looks like one of those kids who gets straight a's and plays violin/trumpet and has rich parents. Everyone think's he's an angel, but behind closed doors he gets rickity recked and loves partying and risky businness. He just never gets in trouble because he is 'well to do'. 

Oh yea and he wears polos and multi colored chino shorts.


I wouldn't let my kids out late at night with him. 

My cat had a friend like this! But instead of patiently waiting, she just yelled for him until he came out (she was Siamese and I hear they're vocal like that.)  It was pretty cute despite the meowing for my cat at 1am every night. (And how the hell are they so punctual.. it was always within 10 minutes of 1am) 
We had 2 outdoor cats and George HATED all the other neighborhood cats. Males would often court Cali and I think he was jealous lol. He would also taunt the neighbor's Lab just out of reach of its invisible fence xD

One day I heard some deep yowling out the window and saw George stalking a black and white cat following Cali up the yard. This is when I found out George had made friends with the Collie across the street, because I then saw them both charge at this cat together and run it out of town. They then peacefully went their separate ways which was odd for George, we thought he hated all dogs. Perhaps this was just a temporary truce to keep tabs on his woman :P
What you don't know is, this is actually your cat's skooma dealer.
Adopt this cat you soulless human being
My cat, Ralph, is in the background here. This was his best friend who used to come call on him before we moved house. We used to see them stalking around the estate when we were out.  http://imgur.com/DAAsshh
A good 15 years ago, we lived next to someone who had a cat. Theirs or mine would wait at the porch of either house for the other cat to be  sent out. They then would play games of hide and seek, apparently. One would go under the patio while the other ran to hide. Mine liked to climb a tree and hide on the roof of the house.

My cat is still alive and well at the age of 19. :) Although she lost most of her agility; She has difficulties climbing on the sofa or beds.
He looks like my little princess: https://imgur.com/a/gX8XP
"Excuse me, miss Walker. Can Nala come out to play? 
I have a cat wait outside for my cat to come out to play everyday when I get home. So cute. 
The other day ago i was walking home past some apartments and this cat walked up to me... so i figured eh ill sit down with him for a sec... i sat down and he got in a crawling type pose and crawled up to me as if he was stalking me, then we sat there for about 10 minutes until i had to leave... i figure he was a stray that was being taken care of by somebody, cause he had a cut ear (like they normally do when releasing strays back into the wild i guess?) still, neat cat encounter
So, because no one else has asked to confirm:

Is Ralph a neighbor's cat? Or is he a neighborhood cat that you've decided to name Ralph?
**Let the right one in.**
We have something like this too. Our next door neighbor has a little girl (actually from my brother who took in a female stray who popped out babies) and looks like a mini of my boy cat without the white markings. 

They play together everyday out in our front yard. Then he comes in during the afternoon and sleeps all day long. Don't worry guys, my boy is fixed so no kitties from him! Though my son said "it makes me sad he won't have babies with her." 

Tiny girl (that's her name) comes to our front door and waits every morning if he isn't already out.

YEAAAAHHHHHH

Does Ralph let you pet him?
When my cat was young he used to have a friend from down the street. They hung out almost every day until my cat broke his leg and had to stay inside for a month or something until it healed. After that she never wanted to see him again, she got angry and hissed at him everytime he tried to make contact. 

Can only believe he missed one too many dates.
One of my cats passed away a few months back. His friend continued to show up everyday for weeks. Cried my eyes out every time.
My dog had a friend like that where we used to live. Sandy, my dog, had to stay in the house all day while I went to work. Coco, the neighbor's dog and Sandy's best friend, was let out of her house as early as 6 AM and stayed out all day. Coco quickly learned that I'd be home around 3 PM and would be sitting on the front porch, waiting for me to get home and let Sandy out. Then, the two of them would run all over the valley.

On a side note, my boyfriend's company does some work in the quarry up the road from where we used to live. He was telling me the other day about this awesome dog that comes to visit at the quarry. It was Coco. He didn't know that I used to live there and he was shocked when I showed him a picture of Coco and Sandy laying in the lawn together. 
Cute but at the same time people shouldn't let their cats roam around outside. It's dangerous to both the cat and wildlife plus they life far longer when they're inside cats vs outside cats. 
"This is a random picture of a cat just sitting on the wall and I made this story up because gullible idiots on the Internet will believe anything, oh yeah, here's a picture of my dragon that I ride in my spare time"
Ralph has weird toes.

Looks a lot like my old cat Chaos.
Soulmates!

He wants food.
You should post to /r/likeus aswell i think. 
Ralph is a handsome boy
Rip viserion, keep ur pets safe
What I want know OP is: Did he ask for a banana and did you give it to him?  


Edit: ......Now I really wanna see someone photoshop this cats face over Carters face

Hey...my cat's name is Ralph also!

OP is Ralph a street cat or does he have a home?
Ralph has a better social life than some redditors xD 
Handsome!
i bet he's a real eddie haskell.. sucking up to parents but getting into real trouble once they're out on the streets 
Ralph is so handsome and patient. 
I love his adorable feetsies.

I have a good friend who owned a cat who had a best friend like this and the best friend's owner would put out a bowl of kibble on the porch and the cat would only eat half, letting my friend's cat eat the other half.  Every day.  My friend's cat was old and finally died and the other cat still would only eat half of his food every day.  It was so sad.
Hi Ralph 
Awww, they have a cat gang!
My cat also has a BFF that he meets in our yard on most days. They terrorize the neighborhood dogs by climbing on the fences and running away.
Is you cat's name Liesl?

He's so cute i'm gonna die :'( <3 <3 <3
I once had a cat named Kelly.  When I was young she would walk me up the street to school every morning.  As a child I didn't think anything of it and to this day I only know of it because my parents told me.

Around the same time during one of my Dad's house-building projects, my mom rescued a stray white cat that got trapped in the crawl space of the house.  We brought him home, cleaned him up and named him Tony.  Tony and Kelly would play in the mini-forested area in the centre of our cul-de-sac almost every day.  I remember seeing them each start from several metres apart and run at each other.  Then when they got close they'd leap at each other and touch paws.  Growing up I thought that was normal cat behaviour.

Then my wife and I got cats a few years ago and reality set in.  Most don't play nice.
Those eyes. Good cat.
Meanwhile my cat is so large he leaves dents in the hoods of peoples cars. My little secret.
Well Ralph. You are a very cute ans polite cat.
Did he ask for a banana?
He is puuurfectttt üòª
My cat used to have a friend like that. Every day he would come in front of the door to pick her up. The cutest thing ever. After some time we moved to a different location. We didn't take the other cat who seemed well fed yet homeless perhaps an outdoor cat. I feel a bit sad that we separated the match made in heaven. This was a while ago. And I went back to look for the other cat to take it with us, but we didn't find him. My cat passed away from old age a couple of years ago, and the other cat probably has as well. 
[deleted]
There's an outdoor cat that's my neighbors that will sneak in our house at any opportunity he gets. He loves my cat and loves to lounge and nap in my bedroom. One time though he gave my cat a cold so I stopped letting him in :( he also has been tracking in fleas. It sucks cuz he's super sweet and my cat likes him. 
Awwww!  The look on his face like is he ready or what?
[Jenny and the Cat Club](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/may/25/buildingachildrenslibrary.booksforchildrenandteenagers) was one of my favorite books as a kid. Makes me happy to think that the neighborhood cat party is still raging.
We have a marvelous neighborhood Samoyed that waits outside our back door to play with my dog. He's the best. 
Was hoping for a mouse on a motorcycle
He's banging your cat
"So can Bobby come out to play?"
Living in the city it's hard, everyone is inside using their tech.

I miss the old days when everyone was playing outside.

At least I have this pal, I just have to wait a little bit for him, his humans slaves are slow to do things, but it's ok.
Aw, what a polite kitty.
My neighbor's cat fucked the neighborhood cat and now there's like 15 of them up and down our street, all fat because our neighbors love feeding them.
Never has a daily murder spree seemed so adorable.
I'm really not a cat guy but Ralph is such an adorable cat name.

I'm interested in learning more about this playtime for cats.  Do they go out and then you call your cat back after an hour?  Do they go out and just come back whenever your cat feels like it?

Ralph's coming to fuck, sorry to break it to ya
Fuck people who let their cats outside. They are responsible for the death of almost a billion birds a year, many endangered. Outside cats are the world's biggest group of invasive species. 
wow TIL I learned that 1% of cats play socially with other cats
Sure, it looks cute, but, for the love of God, DON'T LET CATS OUTSIDE. It's terrible for local wildlife populations. Cats are natural hunters, and kill things for the sake of killing things. If they see a bird, they'll kill it because it seems like a fun thing to do. When you own an animal, it's your job to make sure they don't do anything stupid. 
Let's say you don't care about local wildlife. You're also exposing your cat to disease, ticks, fleas, etc. And if your cat isn't spayed, well I hope you ready to deal with a litter of kittens. You also may just never see it again one day. Maybe today is the day it just doesn't feel like coming back. Maybe it gets hit by a car. 
TL;DR: Letting your cat outside is stupid and irresponsible. 
[deleted]
Please don't let your cats run loose. You're a shitty neighbour if you do.

Edit: I sould add, an irresponsible pet owner as well. If your cat gets run over, it's 100% your fault.
Hecken go friend 12/10 on time.

Can these kitties get their own sub?
"'Scuse me... can your cat come out to play please?"
How nice to have a faithful friend.  Beautiful
You need to put a camera on your cat and see where they go
Being more of a dog guy, how do cats work? Avoiding anthropomorphic explanations, what's actually going on here? Do these cats consider each other part of the same 'pride'/family? I though cats were solitary and territorial?
Take him in
Awwww!
I'm getting "Hey You, Pikachu" flashbacks.
I want to see how they play together

Totally adorable... My cat would love to be let out to go on adventures, but she hates other cats so she wouldnt have a friend like this lol also im too worried something bad would happen to her out there or she just wouldnt come back one day. 

You should put a go pro on your cat and record the adventures! 
kewl
Awww that's so sweet. I'm glad your cat has a playmate. 
"play" time
My best friend and his girl used to have one very dominant female cat, one day they adopted a young female cat (saved her from ukranian streets) and ...that unleashed hell at their home. The older female refused to accept the new roommate. They allmost had to keep the kitten in her own room.

A few weeks later they adopted a third cat from Ukraine, a very strong but calm male one.

Up from this day all was good, the 2 females dont fight anymore.

You could allmost say there was missing a male one there, if you wanna sound clich√©.

At least a very interresting relationship these 3 cats haveüòä

Aww- can Kitty come out and play?
That's actually your cat in law.
Hey u/franwalker26 I just logged in after 2 years of lurking, to say this.... 1) What a handsome pair they make, and 2) Why the hell are your light switches so god damned low?
So /u/franwalker26 , your cat Nala scampers out with Ralph and they go on a play date, and she comes back home later with him (or by herself)?

Thank you for sharing this adorability.

So you also belong to Ralph or is it a neighbors cat? 
I have an asshole of a tuxedo cat and we moved to a new apartment complex. There is this really sweet Siamese cat that I am certain just wants to play.

My cat just won't stop hissing and slapping at it though... After literally months, they can now be within 3 feet of each other sleeping, but that is all.
lol, my cat named ralph looks exactly like this
Hi Ralph
Pretty sure Ralph is my cats father, he owes kitten support. 
What are you doing? Bring him in!
can we have some photos of them together?
Stfu ralf
I wish my cats would play with the neighborhood cats. My male is the biggest scaredy cat ever but soon as the neighborhood cat comes around he is ready to throw down.
They fucking
"Playtime" huh
That is incredible! 
My mom has a Ralph, his name is Rufus. This rough looking ginger cat who comes to the back patio door every night at precisely 9pm. 
I love Ralph!
I need videos
HI RALPH!
Hello ralph!and what is ur cat's name ? I want to see a pic of both of them sitting side by side..i wonder what adventure  they have everyday.one can write a journal out of it
Had the same thing happen to a kitten we owned. Poor thing was run over, and the other cat just never left after that. Had that cat over 15 years. 
My cats had a cat friend too! He'd wait in our garden every morning for me to let my two out. My cats didn't like each other, but behaved themselves in polite company.
Ahhh... His name is Ralph, man... 
Is it poor etiquette to rub his belly and feed him nice food?
What kind of cat is that?
News flash your cat is a prostitute, you probably should have noticed how quiet he has been at the dinner table, or how his grades are slipping. Obvious cries for help gone unnoticed due to your selfish ways
Totally looks like he's waiting his girlfriend  LOL 
You call him Ralph, but everyone else calls him Al.
how do we know that cat isn't a government spy looking into your house?
They're getting ready to go kill seasonal song birds
Thats not Ralph. Ralph is a chicken and lives on a farm!
Thank you for not kidnapping the cat.

Reddit seems to think that if a cat is outside, is nice to you and is not wearing a collar that its free for the taking.
clearly your door is activated by Jedi mind tricks! xD
So damn cute.
Meanwhile my cat hates all other animals. One of the friendliest to humans that I've ever seen, but goes crazy when a dog or another cat gets near it.

Starts swatting at it with its clawless paws
That's so cute! I use to have a cat wait in the back of the yard for my cat to be let out at the old house I use to live in.
Would this happen to be in Mission Bay, San Francisco? 
Soooooooo cute

It's not play time it's a HUNTING PARTY.  Serious business.
Collect a female cat? Mmm.. .
Can we get an update of then two kitties playing?

My cat has a boyfriend that looks exactly like her. Drove by my neighbours house and saw them rolling around together on the lawn and giving each other tongue bathes 
I love Ralph and Nala
That cat looks like a bad influence
He is probably waiting so he can fuck your cat.
That's so fucking adorable!! 
My cats are the protect angel of my dog. When they see me walking my dog they follow us to see if the dog is okay. If there is a dog barking sometimes they will both defend our dog. Its so cool to see such wonderful bond. They are both kinda old but they still do this. 
So cute... what a cool cat! 
Are you gonna take Ralph in? It's only fair. 
Random q: is this hemisphere apartments in Birmingham? Looks very familiar 
HELLO THIS IS RALPH, I HAVE COME TO COLLECT YOU SOUL ! THIS TIME A CAT SOUL WON'T DO ! I KNOW THEY HAVE NINE, STROP TRYING TO TRICK ME HOOMAN !
"WELL?"
Hey you wanna get some coffee?
When a cat has a better social life than you :(
He's actually bullying the other cat, but acts all nice and innocent around the parents. So clich√©
"B
Wait a minute..that's not Ralph!
This soothes my soul :3
Is this in ny?
I love white chested tabbies!!!
So cute!!
OMG I love this! So darn cute!
Wow looks exactly like my old cat, but the male version 
How do you know his name is Ralph?
Looks identical to my cat, white patches and all
I require evidence of this, "play time". please provide more pics to receive my "aww".
Your cat must be the neighborhood nip dealer.  
"Hey, can [cat name] come out to play?"
What time does he come over and how long do they play? Where do they play and what do they do?
My kitten would love to have a best friend like this! Her life is all about PLAY! 
PLEASE take a video of them running off together for adventure time (note that I put please in caps so you know I'm serious)
This comment will probably get a shit ton of hate, but I've always held this view that cats are really mean - specially to each other! The idea that they have bffs and spend the day on adventures is both mysterious and adorable. :') 
Ralph looks like he's up to no good.  Are you sure there is not catnip involved? 
Video of play time?!
Sweet little guy - I hope he's careful with those cars just a few feet away.
What's weirded me out about this post, is that we had a neighbour cat that looked quite similar to this, who we dubbed Ralph O.O
Cute. 
It would be awesome if your cat is named Sam.
Aww Ralph is adorable!
This cat gets it. So cute!
I love when animals are more human than humans   
All cats are spies 
Adopt him 
Hey Becky, lemme smash 
Aaaaah looks like my Pico. <3 ;_; 
Haha he's so cute !
"Playtime"
Why does he look [just like my cat?](http://i.imgur.com/DTOJfvJ.jpg)
"Playtime"
"Hi Mrs. Nala's mom, can Nala come out to play?"
I feel like I belong here. 
So cute *-*
Playtime or planning to take over the world? Lol
I wish I had a friend like Ralph.
Cats should remain indoors.
Stelllllaaaaaa!!!!!
play=breed
While I can't even get a textback
Handsome Nuzzle king!!!!!!
SO CUTE
Uh huh. "Playtime". I hope you already have the chapel booked...
Now that is a fucking sweet kitty 
Hi, Ralph! :) >3
Aww he has a play date
Or.. or... its just a cat chill'n outside your door today.
I need to see them together
What they will play usually..
Ralph is a cutie. We need a picture of Ralph and your cat together. 
Cuse me, mister! Can Felix come out to play?

Playmates!
How did you resist not hug it and make it yours
I'm jealous that your cat has friends...
They fuckin
And thats how you get your house cat pregnant
How tf you know his name is ralph

You should adopt Ralph. I mean if you named him and everything. 
Fake news. This is just a picture of a regular cat.
That cat owes me money. 
I think he's related to my cat.  http://i.imgur.com/EPtw6ld.jpg 
Just upvoting any normal picture of a cat now?
Then a few days later gets a child support package
What's your cat's name? My wife needs the "entire story" apparently.
cats belong indoors

stop letting them roam

numerous good reasons why if youre interested in you know....keeping them healthy as long as possible and not decimating bird populations.
Neighbor's cats come and ruin my garden everyday by littering. Someone told me to get a cat myself who will mark his territory in my garden and keep other cats from soiling in my garden. 
Got the car and he turned out to be fucking useless. All he does is watch them poo and then go smell it himself. Pathetic.

Here are some things to consider before you let your cat go roaming around outside with the likes of Ralph.

You seem to have disregarded the basic health and safety of your cat.
Ralph bangs Nala

Cats with benefits 
I think playtime is more like sexy time. Ralph is pile driving your cat.
Years ago my friend had a cat showing up at his place. We started to blaze him down and he kept returning day after day, relentlessly meowing at us until we got him stoned again and again.
