I can‚Äôt believe dog fighting still exists - who could enjoy participating in this awfulness 
Her name is Peanut. Dog fighters cut the ears off dogs so they don‚Äôt get bitten off in the ring. They don‚Äôt care how clean or neat they look and they don‚Äôt want to pay a vet to do it since dogs like Peanut are just supposed to be bait dogs who get killed helping train the real fight dogs. Peanut was luckily dumped right after she had puppies. She requires some minor daily care for her ears since they are no longer shaped in a way to protect the ear canal but she‚Äôs a very happy and healthy dog otherwise. People are monsters but my sister is an angel!

Edit - a word

Edit 2:  my sister saw the post and corrected me on one thing. She did not make the ears - a wonderful person on Etsy did. She will custom make ears for your dog too so I am including the link here for the people asking. Also for the people asking - the new ears don‚Äôt bother her damaged ears. They don‚Äôt negatively affect her hearing. They actually keep her ears more protected from the cold or rain when she goes outside. She doesn‚Äôt wear them around the house or when doing anything other than going out. She has another dog who loves to lick Peanuts ears - which doesn‚Äôt hurt them but probably gets a little annoying sometimes for Peanut so the new ears help. They also help keep her from looking too intimidating or scary when out on walks so they have overall really improved the quality of Peanuts life and look super adorable too!

Aww poor baby, I‚Äôm glad your sister is such a good mum to her üíú
I am so glad peanut is in a good loving home now. You are lovely people. 

Mutilating dog's ears, tails is horrific and should be illegal.
Seriously, how is dog fighting still a thing ?
As a member of r/crochet those ears are adorable.
Beautiful! They made cropping of the tail and ears illegal here in Australia! 
Oh my god my heart. Her face üò≠ and that expression!

Thank you for sharing this and making my day! And thank you to your sister for giving her a loving home ‚ù§Ô∏è


Hey Sora, I think there is a lucky emblem around here.
That's so sweet!
My sister has corrected me on something. She did not make the ears, she ordered them from an artist on Etsy who makes them custom to order. Here is the link to her shop - please check her out because she‚Äôs doing amazing things w her talent. 

I should have known - I‚Äôve never seen my sister crochet in her life but she‚Äôs so crafty I thought she just figured it out.

The more I see the cruel things people do to animals, the less I like people. Glad that there‚Äôs people that care about those animals.
This really warms my cold, dead heart
Restoration 100
The things that dog has been subjected to is apparent through its eyes.
It‚Äôs almost sad when you see the cutest thing on the internet this early in the morning.
Crazy how deeply and strongly you can feel the sorrow in her eyes. Seriously, I see people around me with emotionless eyes, not having a clue wh√°t they might be contemplating. And then there's this beauty with her humbleness. 

Bravo for the rescue and bless this four-legged lady! 
There is a special place in Hell for those that are involved with dog fighting.
I fucking hate these dog fighting assholes. Im not even a dog person or am very involved in animal wellfare (although love my cat to death). But this shit gets me all riled up.
[removed]
While I understand some dogs get their ears cropped for various reasons, hack jobs like this by some scumbag make me sick. I hope they caught the bastard 
Dog fighting, bull fighting - they die horrible deaths for the amusement of humans....disgusting. Those people deserve the worst. I am so glad Peanut is living a better life. 
We should follow Australia in banning ear clipping and tail docking for aesthetics. The people who think it‚Äôs okay to do this don‚Äôt really love animals. 
‚ù§Ô∏è great job!
Brings me joy seeing people give animals a second chance and a better life. Domesticated animals are all love. 
Awww. She's so sweet. The look in her eyes pains me. She looks perpetually worried üòû
Those eyes.  They've seen some shit
Things like this make me wish we had an animal offenders list, like they have sex offenders. It keeps people from adopting or taking any kind of animal in. I know it wouldn't be a perfect system, but I think it would help. People who do this shit are filthy, vile and just below dirt in my book.
By the look on the picture you can tell this is a gentle animal. it's a shame what deplorable/repugnant/troglodyte human beings are capable of doing
Precious!  So glad that baby has the LOVE she deserves.
I love peanut 
When I come to power dog fighters get the guillotine.  
Beautiful Joe.
That dogs seen some things
There's a special place in hell for people who cut off a dog's ears.
This makes me so sad, I also can‚Äôt stop thinking about what happened to her puppies when she was dumped... breaks my heart to think they might have the same fate :/

EDIT: OP, does your sis have any info on the puppies? 
Honestly FUCK whoever cut the ears off of this girl. 
This is my favorite thing in the entire world. Your sister is also now my favorite person in the entire world
Okay, those ears are so cute! And I seriously want a beanie like that for myself.
Cutting off a dogs ears and tail is so so so terrible. Poor baby. I remember when I was little I read the book Black Beauty and in that it also mentioned that there were puppies who's ears and tails got cut off (the book plays in a different time) and I got so upset that I had to put the book away and never finished it. It's so aweful. I'm glad she has a good home now though. Give her a lot of hugs and kissies and scratches from this random internet stranger. 
I hate people who chop their ears off, most only do it because it "looks cool" like what the hell? It's abuse and can cause ear infections, if anyone does that to their pit you don't love your dog at all.
MY HEART
Cropping dogs ear should be a felony and any vet who does them should lose his license.
Now is a good bear boy 
/u/hipenguins omggggggg
Looks like when you buy ears at Disney land!
Thank you that made my day
pup + babushka = pupushka
Prosthetics are getting more and more advanced. She looks so much cuter than she already was before.
My hearrrt
Poor baby ‚ù§Ô∏è very cute ears afterward though. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
She looks scared, worried and/or confused.
Post some more pictures. In the mean time, I hope she gets some belly rubs and warm cuddles.
Dog fighters who have participated at ANY level deserve to be strung up and tortured until they beg for death. 
Is your sister taking ear orders? My rescue pup didn't come with any either and he could really use some üíô
This makes me so happy!! What a beautiful girl! Her new ears look fabulous :-)
I want to hug her forever 
My brothers chihuahua ear looks like this, its because it got an ear hematoma and the vet told him to not remove the bandage for 4-5 days after her ear surgery, well he did that and when he took it off the 5th day her ear tissue was colorless and rotting. eventually her ear fell off a couple days later. it was so gross! we went back to the vet of course and they gave her some antibiotics to prevent any infections and told us this happens all the time. 
I adopted two Cane Corsos and both their ears and tail have been docked/ cropped. I absolutely hate it the practice all because its considered "breed standards "which I find bullshit. 
Every summer I have to clean and help heal the ears if one and the tail of the other because flies and Nats start eating away at them. 
I'm not crying... You are.
Fuck those sickos that fight dogs and thank god for people like your sister in the world. 
One day my dog fell hard, she is a great dane and she was going full speed up steps. I don't know how it happened but it ripped her nail down past the quick. 

The scream that my puppers let out, it actually dropped me to my knees. Other than hearing that scream from my one of my hurt kids, it is the worst sound I have ever heard in my life. 

How? How can anyone call themselves a person and do something to a dog that causes that kind of scream. 
This pisses me off so bad!  The people who did this need their ears cut off!  My blood is boiling!

That hat is cute.  Poor puppy :(
monsters and angels: the history of the whole Goddamn world right there
Bless her
This is so sweet üòçüòçü§ó
That moment you wish you could just give back the ears and sorry.
Tell your sister that her dog scored a 10/10 on the cuteness factor. 
Wish all people who made animal fight each other would all die instantly 
It would give me so much joy to take a pair of rusty scissors, and knudge off the ears of the "people" who did this. Bless your sister.
OMG! Peanut is beautiful!!!! I own a pitmix too, Marley, who we rescued from being a "bait" dog. The idiots who bred her tried to cut off her ear with kitchen scissors and failed--thankfully we bought her from them before they could make a second attempt. 

BUT we got her one of these cowl-hats too! Did this come from The Wooly Kraken shop on Etsy? Ours did!

Love to you & Peanut! Wishing you many happy years!
Damn why are there so many shitty people on this planet? 
This is my favorite thing in the entire world. Your sister is also now my favorite person in the entire world
DEATH TO ANIMAL ABUSERS!

Oh, boy my throat hurts again.
I honestly would like to find the disgusting creatures who run rings like this and turn them into bait humans.

Hunt poachers.

End program for anyone involved in animal cruelty. 

No remorse for people who consciously make these decisions and participate in such barbarism. The animals don't have a choice but the people involved did. Makes me sick.

Your sister is a Saint for rescuing this beautiful dog. 
It disgusts me that people still participate in ear cropping, tail cropping, declawing... It needs to be banned

Bless all who rescue any animal, especially abused ones. Takes a special soul. 
Im ok with going to hell, as long as i get to help the demons torture people that use dogs as bait/fighting
I wish I could go full Mike Tyson on the people who treated her like this. And I'd be super proud to have such an awesome sister as yours ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Got me wondering if it would be possible to add some sort of ears with surgery, only to give the cover for the ear canals. Like how they use excess skin to patch up big wounds sometimes. The wooly ears are adorable tho! Good sister, and good girl!
I commend your sister. She has a kind heart , generous soul, and has talent to boot .Her baby girl looks absolutely adorable with her new ears!
The pain in her eyes makes me hurt inside

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
Poor puppy! Thanks to your sister she‚Äôll now know a life of love and stability. Thanks for sharing. You‚Äôre educating people about this shady dog fighting culture that is cruel to dogs beyond measure. Here‚Äôs to happy trails ahead.‚ù§Ô∏è
Please be very careful when this dog is around small children. She looks adorable and innocent and I like pitbulls but considering she was a fighting dog all it takes is a loud noise or a child screaming to make her snap back to her instincts and cause some harm. It happens all the time 
She‚Äôs beautiful! 
She looks concerned, but in her heart she knows she is becoming happy and loved. 
Doesn‚Äôt wearing the fake ears make it even harder for her to hear, since it is covering what little of her ears she has left?
I‚Äôm not a fan of cropping ears.... but that‚Äôs a terrible job. Poor thing probably had them cut with scissors at home =[ 
Oh she looks so sad still:( like she expects something bad is about to happen at any moment. Poor pupper, good on your sis for taking her.
Human: ‚ÄúHave you no compassion, making light of this poor dog whose ears were mutilated, and rubbing in the humiliation by making him wear a knitted cap?

Dog: Are you kidding me? I love it! I‚Äôm making everyone laugh. No attention is bad attention.
What a sweetie. People are absolutely horrible. Human beings truly don‚Äôt deserve dogs. Thank goodness there are people out there like your sister to help even out the evil in this world. I am so happy this sweet dog is able to have a second chance and get a shot at the life she deserves. It breaks my heart to think of all the dogs out there who won‚Äôt get that chance. 
Peanut is a beautiful baby girl and your sister is amazing for taking on the responsibility and care of helping a rescue dog like her. It's a long road for these poor abused dogs to feel a sense of normal and love after what they are subjected to. 
[deleted]
This shit disgust me. Happy to see another dog taken out of that wretched practice. 

Dig the ears! They make her look like a little bear haha
She looks worrie. But cute
Great now I‚Äôm crying at work. What a sweet little baby angel, the pupper and your sister for giving her a good home. Also peanut is the sweetest name in the whole wide world!!!! 
OMG you win the internet today. What a complete sweetheart
This is so cute
god bless your sister üôèüèº
aww. she is precious.  makes me happy knowing not all humans are unworthy of our canine friends love.


She looks intensely concerned that somewhere there's a human who needs their face licked
You know...that dog has been through alot in its lifetime if it did indeed come from a fighting kennel. her nose is scarred. her ears are badly mangled. whoever cropped her did a \*terrible\* job. Please don't make her life worse by calling her a baby, and dressing her in knit. Respect her history. Treat her like a dog who has been fought. Muzzle her in public. Get liability insurance on her  because she's probably animal aggressive. Keep a thick, short leash for public walks. Make sure she has a reinforced crate so that she can't escape. If you treat her like a baby, she will probably surprise you by acting like a pit bull, which is what she is. 
that things gunna murder your kids 
that is so fucking sad. im sorry poor doggie. this cute lil hat saves her !
We have a pitbull. He's a handful, but very expressibe just like this guy.

It's weird because our dog's ears folded back in a way that looked like they were cropped, and we'd get compliments on it.  So, we'd reply "Oh, no, they're not cropped, we don't mutilate our dogs"
OMG and she has it in her house? only a matter of time before it kills someone and snaps.

Ooooh he looks like he‚Äôs hungry for babies
More pitbull propaganda
Looks like this was someone's first attempt at docking ears... Also, there's no reason to dock the ears on this kind of dog.  
Give that beautiful baby a kiss on the forehead from me and my doggies. Crocheted ears are amazing. 
your sister's gonna die :(

Its 9 in the morning & ya done broke my heart with this wholesomeness!!!! I love the fuck outta this <3
That face!!! Oh my goodness!!! I would get literally nothing but pets done if I woke up to that face every day. 
She looks so worried :(
Whoever did this deserves the chair
She could make her all sorts of different ears and hats and stuff for every time of the year. 
Awww! That little girl is so sweet!! 
She needs a treat right now!
Awwww u actually feel so bad tho and so do i
She‚Äôs precious! 
I love her.
I don't know if I'm crying because of what this poor baby has gone through or crying because she's been rescued?? !! God Bless your sister!! I love the new ears! üíïHappy life sweet girl!!
She does look very concerned 

Bless your sister 
Cutest hat omg
Seeing those cropped ears makes me sad, im glad she‚Äôs going to a good home now
What a sweet baby bub. Much love to Peanut! üê∂ü•ú
That's what Jesus actually did with the guard who got his ear chopped off. He sew him a new one. Reality sucks OR is even more awesome than fiction, depending on your perception.
I‚Äôm glad she found a safe and loving home. 

What a cutie. 
She seems to be doing much better now. That old sad face is heartbreaking. Kudos to your sister! üëçüèº She seems to be an adorable  girl

you can see all the love in their eyes.
Peanut is so perfect I want to love her
All the power to her, she did a good thing.
I've read the thread below and there seems to be so much outrage at the treatment of Peanut and over the issue of dog fighting in general. I am in the U.K. where we have our own issues with animal cruelty, so I am in no position to comment about the U.S situation but I did a little reading and found this link. I think it is really important not simply to feel outrage but to let that feeling make you act to bring about change. I will try to do what I can to change the situation in the U.K. Thank you Peanut, here's to a long and happy life with your new Mum.[One Green Planet](http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/10-ways-you-can-help-end-dog-fighting/)

This makes me happy. People that mutilate dog ears have a special place in hell. I‚Äôm even against tail cropping too. But ears especially.
I don't knit...my dog gas the same type if ear damage.  Where can I get a hat like this? 
I just want to hug Peanut forever. 

Also, your sister is a good person
Your sister is saint and love her and Peanut. 
god bless your sister for helping a creature ‚ô°‚ô°
I'd like to have a friendly and totally not violent meeting with the kind of people who mutilate dogs
now she can hear even less
How is dog fighting still a thing? Im glad this dog is safe now, shes gorgeous and the headpiece is adorable. 
That poor pup. I'm glad your sister is a decent person. Pitbulls are great dogs when they're not used for evil.
I love your sister! She‚Äôs a saint.

Omg those trusting eyes!!! 
Both sets of ears are beautiful!  Adopt the cropped!!!
So cute! My cousin has a rescue rottweiler whose original owner snipped of his ears with scissors when he was a pup. He's actually very sweet. He's over 100 pounds and thinks he's still a little puppy. A lap puppy, lol. 
Damn. I want to be a dog fighter, fighter. Fuck those pieces of shit. 
I love this! 
My heart is literally melting, what kind of shitbag does that to this poor little baby :(
Omg be still my heart. She‚Äôs precious and your sister is awesome. ‚ù§Ô∏è
My terrible sister took the ears off her pup like this & plans to breed. I asked my brother if we can ‚Äúput her down‚Äù.  -_- 
She was probably a D1 wrestler 
Bet the same guy who dumped this sweetheart after having kids probably did the same thing to a human female after he knocked her up. But that's none of my business. 
Perfectly suits on Peanut
no you‚Äôre crying. this is so sweet. 
‚ù§Ô∏è
Absolutely love this. Cutest dog ever.
Every year from now you'll have to celebrate New Ears' Eve with her! But without fireworks.
I wanna give her so many hugs!
Your sister is a good person and she looks adorable with her little bear ears now.
Thank you for giving me hope in humanity ‚ù§Ô∏è
Not always for fighting. Sometimes just for the aesthetic, although I don‚Äôt believe in either. 
Love her mouse ears hehe so cute and probably warm ‚ù§Ô∏è 
People who engage in this shit deserve the most elongated painful deaths.
I love her new ears!
SO CUTIE!
You can just tell when a dog has had a hard life, they do wear that stress right on their face like a human. Look at that furrowed brow. I am sure with the love your sister will provide that face will soften over time!!

 Thanks for adopting. 
Cuteness overload!
You can see it in her eyes.
Her eyes look so sad. I just wanna hold that poor girl. 
Oh my gosh.... I LOVE THIS!!! YOUR SISTER IS AWESOME!! üòçüëèüëèüëè
Precious angel. 
*PEANUT* üòç
Kawhi Leonard?
Those ears make her look like a bear. Glad that she's in a loving home now.
Cute
So that‚Äôs why Louise Belcher never takes off her hat
She lucks just like my dog. Her ears are one of my favorite features on her and she loves getting them kissed. It breaks my heart that people could just cut them off for the cruelest reasons.
Poor doggo, looks so scared :c
We need stronger punishments for animal cruelty. Period. 
That face! Total sweetheart. 
Sweet baby I just wanna hug 
Can she still hear?
I know this is a happy post, but I'm sitting here at work trying to hide my crying. lol
Do they improve her hearing?
I would give my life for Peanut
See I‚Äôm supposed to be working, but nope, u/walksthesinsemillian‚Äôs having a good ol tear up instead because this is fucking BEAUTIFUL
So glad she‚Äôs with your sister and not those monsters anymore!! She deserves the best. Sending love!! 
Some human beings are fucking sick and I really wish they would get what‚Äôs coming to them. Nothing makes me more angry than animal abuse. Bless your sister!
She looks so sad.
That‚Äôs so fake it‚Äôs clearly a hat
How is she around people? Is she slow to trust? or does she just try to avoid them all together?

Fashionable 
That dog looks so distressed

So wholesome 
My. Fucking. Chest.
"I can't hear a goddamn thing in here."
I thought at first glance that her ears were turned inside out/flipped backwards...

...But then I saw your explanation comment =/

People are...there are no words worthy enough for how despicable they can be
That‚Äôs fucking sick! Makes me ashamed to be human, horrible scum 
That dog looks like she is in a constant state of panic. 
That sick fuck should get their ears cut off for what they did to this sweet baby. Humanity sickens me, breaks my heart when innocents get abused. I'm glad your sister has rescued the poor pup.
That is disgusting but what a happy ending for Peanut I'm glad she has the best quality of life possible now your sister is a wonderful person.
She is adorable omg!! üòçüòçüòç
How is dog fighting still a thing? How is animal fighting of any kind still a thing? People are awful.

Infuriating. There is no punishment too brutal for these people.

What a beauty.

damn op i really didn‚Äôt need to cry today but here i am looking at this sweet baby.
But good on your sister, adoption is a awesome 
I‚Äôm so fucking sad. I love this little girl but I hate this world.
Thank you people for rescuing this girl
I want to hug Peanut. 
She looks fantastic! 
Pits :)))))))))))))) although cutting ears for any animal is bull shit... Plus they look uglier with them cut.
Poor guy looks like he's seen some shit üò≠
That‚Äôs so cute I need some for my dog who we rescued 
She looks at least 15% less humiliated, good job. 
Awww! Lovie! üòç You're beautiful with or without the ears! Those are pretty damn cute though! 
Doggo looks anxious, give Peanut lots of care, poor doggo...
You got any of dem... BABIES?
If she‚Äôs a tortured soul / scaredy-cat i highly recommend socializing her with a pack of friendly dogs, perhaps a high quality doggie day care or a group of friends with kind dogs. It will help her come out of her shell quicker


Aww
You human of glorious heart thank you so much for taking in a pitbull, people are scared of these dogs but don't understand that they NEED a loving heart and training. 
its sad to see them with chopped ears. just because somebody else thinks they look good.
Your sister is a special person üíï
so funny
üòáüòáüòá
Any pics of her with the gorgeous pit smile?
This has me tearing up out of happiness that she has such a loving Mom! Rescued a pitbull mix myself and he has been the biggest joy in my life. Thank you for sharing!!
Still looks sad üòî 
We can rebuild her, we can improve her.
Your sister is a rockstar!
This makes my blood boil. Reason #429 why I prefer dogs over people. Even after such a tragedy, this poor pupper will never not unconditionally love your sister.
I volunteer at an animal shelter regularly and we had a pitbull named Bebe who came in just like this. She was the sweetest dog ever though, her new owner starting ordering special hats for her ears as soon as she was adopted. 
Beautiful babies 
Adorable!
Such a blessing indeedü•∞
Cropping ears is cruel. What's worse is most breeds who have their ears cropped look better natural anyways (only dobies in my opinion look better with cropped ears but that still is no excuse to crop them). Even worse, is this type of cropping that just looks disgusting. Dog looks so much cuter with his fake ears :) (not that hte dog can help his ears as is, that's on the human who had it done).
Damn she's hot
I bet that just adds to her beggin game.
She‚Äôs Beautiful üòò
Removing dogs ears and tails is just cruel. Good on your sister adopting her.
How is mutilating an animal not punishable crime with harsh penalties?
Ugh too cute. Feeling cute aggression. Must cuddle her. 
Peanut I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüôÇ!
Before: Is cold puppy

After: Is bear-y warm puppy
Omg beautiful baby üò≠ bless 
What a beautiful gal, tell her I love her!
So cute and sad, she has that perma scared look to her. I'm glad she has her forever home now. 
Thats a cute looking bear
Those are some beary cute ears :)
It‚Äôs Champion with bad ears instead of a lost leg
My Grandma what deep brown eyes you have...
Peanut is a great name. Hope your sister and the doggie have a happy life together. 
I started reading some of this and had to stop. My parents said they had to take me home once when we went as a family to the rodeo back in the day.  I started screaming, "they're hurting them" over and over during one of the acts (I think roping cows.) 

I got a little ways down on this thread and I will not read any more.  I just wish a hole would open up for people like these that do this kind of stuff and they would just drop in to the center of the earth and disappear.
Sweet angel üíú
Perfect! Please kiss that face
Adorable!
Bear Pooch 
What a sweet face ! She actually looks happier with her little hat on. Much thanks for rescuing!

That is a very sweet little girl. She pretty girl! I love her new ears!
duppy duppy duppy! 
What a good girl :)
Adorable
She looks so much less worried in the second pic. Poor baby. 
That is the sweetest and most adorable thing I‚Äôve ever seen! üíïx infinity!
That face, mom...... What's on my head.....
Awww such a sweetheart. My mom's rescue was also a bait dog but I think she was found before they did any ear cutting. However my mom had to take her to the vet when she was having issues with her tail hurting her. Turns out they had tied off her tail with a bunch of rubber bands to have her tail cropped but  her skin grew around the rubber bands. She had to have surgery to get them out. She is a happy pup now though. 
I'm scared to ask but what happened ?
LET THEM IN üòçüòç
She looks Chronically Alarmed‚Ñ¢Ô∏è please send extra hugs to her üò≠

I have seen look in dogs eyes, a quickly vanishing look of amazed contempt, and i am convinced that basically Dogs thinks humans are nuts.
What a sweet baby. So sad but the ending seems happy. Love your new ears!

I hate some humans.  (Obvs not your sis.)
Bless Peanut's heart.  Her ears are perfect!  I wish her and your sister many years of happiness!!
This might just be my favorite post on all of Reddit.
Love this! I will always upvote a post of a rescue! #adoptdontshop 
She‚Äôs beautiful. What‚Äôs her mix? I definitely see Pit. 

Our girl was a shelter pup who had a ruff start.  She was about a year old when we got her and are her 5th and last home. We did a doggie DNA kit and found that she‚Äôs 50% pit, 25% American bull dog and 25% wire haired dachshund. 
What a sweet face, I‚Äôm so happy she found a kind home‚ù§Ô∏è
üòçüòçüòç
She's absolutely Fucking gorgeous!
The dog looks better than me
Someone needs to 3D print this dog some ears 
*bawling*
Bless you human for taking care of an angel :)
That's awesome! Did she knit that or buy it? If she has a parrern for it I would love it! 
...awesome!!!
Gave her new ears, bought her new ears, it matters not.  What does matter is your sister is a boss and a wonderful human being who has proven, once again, that we do not deserve dogs üêæ‚ù§üêï.
Your sister has a beautiful soul.  
Beautiful Girl and LOVE her new ears!!!
A home that dog deserves to be in
She looks so sad in the first picture, then the second picture she looks way more full of life.
It's just me or everyone thinks the same. Humans are the most evil animals on Earth! 
While everyone is busy discussing the psychoses of the despicable humans that participate in this travesty I want to give big props to your sister for her golden heart land macram√© skills.
Awww adorable
Bless your sister
Your sister is a beautiful person üòç
What a sweet baby! 
What kind of monster clips the ears
Reminds me of how they cut of the tails of pigs and sheep. But people don't seem to have a problem paying for it :(
Just imagine the frightening stuff those big brown eyes have seen 
We rescued a dog with cropped ears and whenever we're out with him I feel like I have to tell everyone that we didn't do that to his ears. 
$6 
You and your sister need to give her all the hugs and kisses from me. 

And my Loki bear (my lab) wants to share his peanut butter with her. 
Awww 
The fact that she looks so sad and scared breaks my heart. I'm glad to hear she'll be given nothing but love now! :D <3
She has the saddest eyes =/
Awe lil cutie

i don‚Äôt deserve this post
Look at her facial expressions. She seems to like her new ears. Thank you very much for doing this. Everything from  considering having a dog that couldve possibly have had trust issues to taking your time knitting her new ears.

Humans make me sick,just how can they be so cruel. Humans are the cruelest to walk the earth. Bless that baby and your sis.
That is so GOD DAMN CUTE!!!!!
I know I am going to get downvoted, again, but you need to understand what you are working with. This dog was fought and fought multiple times. She is not a lap dog. She has a great deal of scarring on her face AND she was bred. Bait dogs are not usually bred because they don't have the amount of aggression necessary to win a dog fight.

You can take this information and do whatever you want with it, but at least you'll have it.

### Simple Summary

Organizations responsible for placing dogs seized from dogfighting investigations often must determine if a particular dog should be euthanized because it is too dangerous or if it is safe to place the dog in an adoptive home. In this study, we examine whether the extent of scarring from dog fighting is a reliable predictor of aggression towards other dogs and therefore could be used to help make that decision. We found that dogs with 10 or more scars in the three body zones where dogfighting injuries tend to be concentrated were more likely, on average, to show aggression to other dogs. The relationship is imperfect, however. Many unscarred dogs were dog aggressive while some highly scarred dogs were not. Therefore, we recommend also assessing a dog‚Äôs behavior before making decisions about its disposition.

### Abstract

When pit bull-type dogs are seized in an investigation of organized dogfighting, heavily scarred dogs are often assumed to be highly dog aggressive due to a history of fighting. These dogs may be deemed dangerous and euthanized based on scarring alone. We analyzed our existing data on dogs seized from four dogfighting investigations, examining the relationship between the dogs‚Äô scars with aggression towards other dogs. Scar and wound data were tallied in three body zones where dogfighting injuries tend to be concentrated. Dog aggression was assessed using a model dog and a friendly stimulus dog in a standardized behavior evaluation. Scarring and dog aggression were significantly related, more strongly among male (Fisher‚Äôs Exact *p* < 0.001) than female dogs (Fisher‚Äôs Exact *p* = 0.05). Ten or more scars in the three body zones was a reasonable threshold with which to classify a dog as high risk for dog aggression: 82% of males and 60% of females with such scarring displayed dog aggression. However, because many unscarred dogs were dog aggressive while some highly scarred dogs were not, we recommend collecting behavioral information to supplement scar counts when making disposition decisions about dogs seized in dogfighting investigations.

## 1. Introduction

Organized dogfighting is rampant in many parts of the United States even though it is a felony offense in all 50 States. The American Pit Bull Terrier is the breed most commonly associated with organized dogfighting in this country \[[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126774/#B1-animals-06-00072),[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126774/#B2-animals-06-00072),[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126774/#B3-animals-06-00072)\].

Dogs that have been pitted against other dogs typically display scars due to the wounds caused by the teeth of their opponent. The scarring associated with organized dog fights is primarily concentrated on the front legs, head, and muzzle. This is a different pattern of injury than that sustained in spontaneous, non-organized fights between dogs, as documented in an earlier study \[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126774/#B4-animals-06-00072)\] and supported by the current study. This is because dogs in organized fights face each other while fighting. In fact, the instruction given by the referee in such fights is ‚Äúface your dog,‚Äù initiating the mutual attack. In addition, while fighting dogs are selected and trained to cause injury to their opponent, non-organized fighting amongst dogs is more likely to consist of ritualized displays and non-injurious biting \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126774/#B5-animals-06-00072)\]. Any injuries that do occur in a spontaneous fights among dogs of the same sex and of similar size are primarily located on the pinnae (ears), dorsal and lateral neck, and front legs‚Äîalthough to a lesser extent than in an organized fight \[[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5126774/#B4-animals-06-00072)\].

In our experience, heavily scarred pit bull-type dogs are often assumed to be highly dog aggressive as the result of a history of fighting. However, we have found that not all dogs seized from dogfighting investigations, including some bearing scars, are aggressive to other dogs. This may be because the dog is in the early stages of its training as a fighting dog and may still retain non-aggressive, social behavior toward other dogs. On the other hand, we have identified some dogs with no or few scars that exhibit significant dog-aggressive tendencies. These dogs are likely young, inexperienced dogs who have not yet been fought, or are dogs that have only been ‚Äúrolled‚Äù (a training fight) once or twice, or breeding dogs who were not used for fighting but possess a strong genetic propensity for aggressive behavior.

It is our experience that some organizations responsible for placing dogs seized from dogfighting investigations do not have the resources to conduct thorough behavior evaluations on the dogs and therefore may rely on extent of scarring to form their decisions on the disposition of the dogs. Highly scarred dogs are usually assumed to be dog-aggressive, although there is currently no commonly accepted threshold for the number of scars on which to base this determination. Other organizations who do conduct behavior evaluations may utilize the extent of scarring as a secondary piece of information, to supplement their disposition decisions, especially with respect to dogs that do not show aggression toward other dogs but also do not engage in friendly behavior. Having information concerning the validity of utilizing the extent of scarring as a proxy for dog aggression would assist these organizations in making more informed decisions, and potentially reduce the euthanasia of non-dog aggressive pit bull-type dogs.

To our knowledge, no analysis has been conducted to determine the relationship between the presence and extent of wounds or scarring and dog aggression among dogs seized from dogfighters. We analyzed this relationship with the following objectives:

1. Describe the extent and distribution of scarring among dogs seized from organized dogfighting investigations;
2. Describe the extent of aggression towards other dogs exhibited by dogs in this population;
3. Analyze the relationship between extent of scarring and aggression towards dogs;
4. Investigate whether the sex of the dog affects the relationship between scarring and dog aggression;
5. Determine whether level of scarring is a useful screening test/proxy for aggression towards dogs and, if so, what threshold of scarring is appropriate for identifying dogs at high risk for dog aggression?
Poor girl, glad she found a good home. 
im so glad this beautiful animal is with a good owner
Yeah for your sister :)
she's beautiful
Awwww.  She's adorable!  I need a hat like that for myself!
Pits/Staffies can be the saddest looking and also the toughest looking dogs ever. 
Dog fighting is shit.

Watching toddlers fight is better
so that she can hear the toddlers
Extend the compassion; go vegan.

Keep that thing away from my dog and any other dog or children. Abused + Pitbull = even more of a timebomb than a normal pitbull 


No thanks. 
Should have just killed it.
Sure, weep for the dogs and their mutilated ears but don't even bat an eye when it's done to your sons.  Business as usual when it comes to ruining human lives..
What? 
Is no one gonna comment that your sister made the ears the wrong shape? Cause now Peanut looks like Minnie Mouse. She's adorable, I'm 100% on board, just very derpy.
