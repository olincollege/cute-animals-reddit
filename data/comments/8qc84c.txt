I love how the cat is just playing it off, like ‚Äúalright whiskers, just act normal and pretend like you didn‚Äôt just pass through a glass table...‚Äù 
That is hilarious.  But I am impressed, despite not expecting to fall that far, the cat handled the landing like a champ.
Your cat had a lot of confidence in that invisible table.
[deleted]
I used to have the same desk. Actually frequency in which it needed cleaning is why I got a new one haha

Edit: Apparently most of Reddit also owns/has owned this desk at one time or another. 
TIL cats use the scientific method.
That is the most precious thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Lol after the jump the cat was like ‚Äúwtf is going on lemme check if the table just vanished‚Äù then **tapping intensified** and ‚ÄúDAMMIT I KNEW IT‚Äù
She's like "WTF DID YOU DO JERRY?! IT WAS JUST HERE!"
The cat version of the classic [dog who thinks the glass door is closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/2hmwn7/dog_stays_outside_because_he_thinks_the_terrace/).
"What happened to the magical force  field that used to be here?" 
Fuck yes, this gif was worth 187 MB on a 2M connection
At the end he's touching it like "what the fuck is this witchcraft?" 
180mb gif? Really?
We did this once to our glass table but instead of jumping on the table, he ran full force into the glass that was leaning up against the wall.  The "Thunk" he made was incredible. 
Logitech Z5500?
Still graceful AF
It almost looks like she had a sense of humor about it. This is really cute.

Edit: She, not he.
I was incredibly confused by this at first...I have almost an identical desk, with an almost identical sub in the corner, with the same weight under the right side, with similar carpet under, and used to have that same keyboard.  If it wasn't for the wall color (which I really, really like by the way) and the cat (also adorable--I have two, but thankfully they aren't doppelgangers as well) I would have thought that I was looking at my own downstairs.
I have this desk!!! The glass is so scratched and ugly after 3 years. I windex and windex and all I can think of are all the scratches. My cats fear it
I wish I had a cat.

I wish I wasn't allergic to cats.

:(
I'd love to know what they're thinking...
It really amuses me to think that many animals must think they're levitating when they lay on glass. To them, the world is full of invisible walls that can disappear and reappear at any time.
Not available
"ah, yes. Everything is ok.  I meant to do this." *rubs*
Swear to god everyone in the world has this desk
He's probably going crazy and contemplating his entire life thus far
/r/catpranks  
Cats are strange and amazing creatures. One of mine is obsessed with the fish tank so much so I count the fish every morning make sure she didn't get one lol. Several times a day she will do a paw check just to make sure the glass is still there, because hey, who knows? Water might be holding itself in place this time.
This should be on r/nonononoyes
I did not expect it to jump up! That was awesome. 
I have the same desk.
Me trying to score
I wish I recovered like that
your cat made my day bearable, thank u 
/r/youseeingthisshit 
What you don't realize is the cat knew that the glass was gone.  The cat was simply testing you to see if you understood its perception of reality.  Cats are always right.  Just realize, now, that when you put the glass top back on, the cat will jump *through* the glass.
Why would you waste time cleaning, son? 
Hey what‚Äôs going on here?
She can be silly sometimes.
I‚Äôd score that dive a perfect 10.  
I know y'all rich fuckers with 100MB/s, but could we have gifs that do not weigh 187MB pls?
Cat handled that jump like a fucking champion. That's a magical creature right there. 
188 MB for a 20 second gif? Fucker!
Yo, I have that same desk. I love that desk. I did very similar thing cleaning it when I went to set down a smoothie , and it went right through.

Lol thank you for sharing this OP. Got a good chuckle from it.
This just made my day, saved forever ‚ô°
I have that keyboard. Logitech g15?
Can someone add cat calculations to this? 
I want to see the cat's reaction when the glass top is put back on.
We have the same desk.  And keyboard.. and speakers. What the hell, are you me?
16.83  There's your trouble, homan person, the part that goes here is missing.
cat goes straight to smelling as if that's going to identify the problem lol
I feel like you can see a part of the cat's brain going HANG ON SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT before the jump but not managing to convince the rest of it to stop.
It's kinda frustrating that I'll never be able to convey to that cat what's happening and it'll never know
This cat is the Richard Feynman of cats, using her paw to create a model of the natural world for future reference (the no table where there is clear was a table not now theory of tables) and predictions. Of course scent marking the "phenomenon" with the side of her face and whiskers in case formal model fails at some point in the future. 
At least it was a 10/10 jump.
You know how when you're going down the stairs and you think there's one less step than there is and for a split second you think "this is how I die"? Times that by a hundred and I bet that's what that cat just went through.
I once spilled drinking water over my bed I had to take the mattress outside for drying.
Came back to find my cat staring at an empty bed frame with devastating look, like it‚Äôs the end of the world for her.

I needed this laugh. 
More important is the update when you put glass back on. Will he or wont he have the same level of confidence?
This has made my day. Thank you. 
Haha this reminded me of my dog but much less graceful. My dog just kinda flopped over and it took him 4 tries before he realized something was wrong.
/r/BetterEveryLoop 
Just watched this on a continuous loop, he jumps so perfectly into the table. 
Lol...that is too funny. Poor baby..
Oh my. I just about peed my pants from laughing so hysterically. But then suddenly, I was overwhelmed with guilt for laughing at the poor helpless and confused feline! The wife and I always talk about our West Highland Terrier being a creature of habit. Well, I think the same applies here. Thanks for the video. I pray the cat recovers soon. 
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt touch the table! I went right though it! Am I a ghost?!‚Äù

That's a good lookin desk ya got there. Looks just like the one I bought not too long ago lol
No no no, you see... I totally did this on purpose!
I have the same desk works well, lmao your cat, classic.
I'm going to go home and try this on my kitten, thank you for brightening up a long day. 
Does anyone know what breed this is? My older cat passed away had this exact fur pattern and everything. Would love to look up pics of the breed. 
Marvelous.  Did not stop its curiosity.  Delightful cat.
I have the same desk, but not the same cat. 
Will someone that knows how to edit video please show us what it would look like if the cat passed through the magical desk plane and came out on the other end as something else? 
"Oh no, I'm a ghost!"
Cat acts all casual... ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just doing hurdles‚Äù.
Seriously love watching animals figure stuff out. 
Nice party/circus trick
Kudos to you for keeping your desk so clean that the cat couldn't tell the glass was gone.
Hahaha

‚ÄúRemoved the glass huh? Fuck it I‚Äôll just fuck up this suction cup!‚Äù

Damn. I guess we vastly overestimate their intelligence. Lovely.

I have this desk! It sucks! 
I have that same desk, and carpet... and wall color with white trimming. My brain glitched for a second
Hey I have the same desk. Time to fuck with my cat!
I like how he played it off..lol
this made me legit LOL 
Note to op: When cleaning top of desk, turn desk into ring of fire for cat to jump in 
To show solidarity with the cat, place coffee cup on the invisible tableü§îüôÇ
such a fucking idiot
Hey, what happened to the force field that's usually here? 
Nailed that jump though 
Stuck the Landing thoi !
Ah, is that a z5500 sub I spot there?

I have two sets. Probably gonna sell one. Bought it from a guy used for $140 lol. Practically a steal if you ask me. I was running two subs using a cable I got from eBay. You learn to appreciate just how powerful that sub is after running two in unison and being overwhelmed lol.
#Cat logic:

*maybe if I paw at, or rub my body on it, it'll go back to normal*

Your cat probably thinks it has super powers now and will try to run through a wall. 
Can you imagine the thoughts going through that cat's mind, thinking it would land on a table but instead "Oh shit! What! Where's the-"
At least your cat is still curious, some cats won't do anything but sleep.

WOOSH

I have that same exact desk lol, some of the suction cups have lost their suction over the years though
I am guessing your cat is the reason you are cleaning it in the first place? Paw prints EVERYWHERE. 
Swish!
I have that exact same desk it‚Äôs pretty awesome! 
I have the same desk. You have either prevented or caused many hours of cat confusion.
I just like how the cat checks it again with it's paw like "whaaa it was juuust here, I could've sworn..."
i would have been shook too
I had that exact same desk as my first desk, the first delivery had the short and the triangle pieces broken, the second attempt the triangle piece was see through and not black and it took like, 3 weeks for the final delivery with the black corner. Then I got disgustingly drunk one day and broke it :(
I have the exact same desk. Now all I need is the exact same cat. 
gfycat in the title confused me for a moment.
Human your invisible forcefield is broken
I have that same exact desk it was like 50$ at walmart 10 years ago. I lost the suction cup thingies though. 
I think it's a requirement that everyone once in their life has to own this desk.  I had the silver one.  I think it was ~$100 on Amazon.
I have that same desk. 
Hey, that didn't work...  let me try it one more time...
Used to have that same desk. It‚Äôs always weird to me that other people have the same furniture as me in their houses. 
That is so great.  "Wtf, Kevin?!!!"
I have that exact same desk!
'telle hooman, what magic is this?'
I have the same desk!
My cat did the same thing with our coffee table.  It's a wooden frame with glass panel insets.  We removed the glass for cleaning and Marco jumped onto it like he normally does and ended up doing a front flip through it, poor guy.
Now I want to take the glass out of my coffee table.
Boing! ‚ÄúWait. How‚Äôd I get back down here?‚Äù
r/catpranks material
Basically cats just trust that the glass is there, probably some black magic to them.

haha what a fuckin idiot
 Cats are known for their champion landings.
Mmmmmmm... still got your Logitech Z-5500. Love that sound system.
Why would you waste time cleaning, son? 
Haha I used to have the identical desk! Sold it when I had to move to another place. I needed to clean those glasses almost once every four or five days, otherwise it becomes unbearably dirty.

You have a cute cat! 
"Maybe if I hit it with my paw it will come back"
Science plays a part here. I'm not sure how, but I am certain it does.
Youre a wizard harry 
That was a great jump.  
You monster
That's is SO funny
Is this the matrix they are always talking about
Your cat looks exactly like my cat, Twix.
I'd like to see the reaction after you put the glass back on 
Cat.exe has stopped
He is confused kkkk
Are... Are you me? I have a desk, speakers, keyboard, and a tabby that all look very identical to yours.
oh nooo :(
Hey I had that desk!
I‚Äôd like to see him try that when you put it back on... 
The form on that feline. Absolute unit 
Hey I have that exact desk!
How many jumps onto the "desk" did it take for your cat to figure this out?
I'm in a library, i cant laughing out loud like this....
Meanwhile, a human expects one last 4 inch step that isn't there and dislocates hip.

I have almost the same desk, and the same Logitech Z5500 subwoofer beneath it.  I hope I can get my cat to perform this stunt as well, that was fantastic.
I love this haha 
Cat taps the desk and says what is this sorcery?? 
Had the same desk in my old apt
That cats going to piss on something tonight I guarantee it
I have that same desk lol
I have an almost identical desk. Bought from IKEA 28 years ago. 
Yep.. Right here... This is basically why I Reddit - I could watch this on a continuous loop for hours.  Cats are the best 
I must have watched this over a dozen times, every time just as impressed. 
Must have jumped to far and missed the table, let me confirm if the glass top is still there.
‚ÄúCareful, human. All is not as it seems.‚Äù
I used to have this same desk. I got it from Jysk. I actually kind of hated it so I sold it.
 I have that same desk! Shelves built in on the right side? Great for gaming 
He played it off like he meant to do that.

something's awry in the Kingdom
Instead of a desk, my dad had a fish tank that his cat liked to jump on. One day, he took off the cover to clean it. His cat jumped in the tank.
I think all of you are missing what this cat is doing... He's clearly an opportunist, using the bar to perfect his his high jump.
I see we have the same desk! Does it also drive you fucking Bananas when you try and get close and hit your chair wheels on the center legs?
I have that same desk, I think it was a target original 
Cat just confirming suspicions. 
Yo I have the same desk, 10/10 would recommend
It‚Äôs crazy how a cat can judge the height of something, and then launch itself to a perfect landing. Not too high, not too short. But just right to ensure a soft landing. 
This post is going places.
https://goo.gl/images/tRPuhT
Whats going to be funnier is when he accepts the glass is not there and slams right into it when you put it back
I ~~could~~ would watch this forever
I have that desk!
"yeah I totally meant to do that."
Does this qualify for r/animalsbeingderps? Absolutely hilarious!
I have this exact desk, now I feel like I need to clean it.

I had this exact desk though mine grey...solid corner desks

No the kitty understands. He is just taking this opportunity to practice high jump 
I find amazing that kitteh is using his whiskers pointed outward to make sure he doesn't boop the glass with his nose.
Had the same desk. Black glass looks soooooo nice. But a dust gatherer. 
Damn this looks like my exact setup when I was a kid, had the same desk and same sub (in the same spot) and keyboard and everything.

r/StoppedWorking maybe?
So years ago I had a chinchilla called Perry. He was fucking adorable, he was like my best fuzzy little friend. He liked to sit either with or on us.

He got so used to jumping on the foot stool we had that one night when my mum moved it he kept jumping up and trying to land on it even when it clearly wasn‚Äôt there, and he was so confused and determined that if he just jumped one more time he‚Äôd land on it as always. It‚Äôs one of the funniest and most adorable things I‚Äôve ever seen an animal do, and this reminds me of that. 

Animals rock
OMG, at 0:17, that's the first time I've ever seen a cat actively use its whiskers to feel for something it can't see before confirming with a paw.
‚Äúwhere‚Äôs the invisible platform‚Äù
Alley-oop!.. Wait wait whoa whoa whoa...oh okay
‚ÄúHeh, I totally knew there wasn‚Äôt anything there. I just did it for fun just cus. Hey this is a nice subwoofer what is it?
I was having a tough day until I saw this. Thank you kind stranger for making my day better.

Same desk :D
Somethins fucky boys
I love it, that could've gone so poorly but it didn't
I had that desk. You don‚Äôt remove the glass for cleaning. Removing entire fingernails is less painful than the assembly of that desk. 
Is it because he‚Äôs dum or he can‚Äôt see glass ?
LMAO awesome!
Classic corner glass desk, got one myself.  My cat just decides to knock all my shit off it lol.
Is that a g105 keyboard?
You obviously did not consult the proper authority before starting your cleaning job. 
Stoopid cat
 Ay nice, I have a black glass and a solid version of that desk set up; super affordable and useful!
I‚Äôm assuming it is a glass top?
That looked like a terrifying moment 
I once took a large poster off my wall due to construction outside shaking the walls so bad I thought it was going to vibrate the frame off the wall...my cat freaked out when she realized it wasn't there any longer, cats are weird.

200MB for 20 seconds? Is this a joke, OP? 
I don't understand why most animals have trouble seeing glass. Is there some kind of abstraction required that most animals are not capable off? Glass isn't really invisible. So something has to be fucking with animal brains to have them act silly.
Dude I have that same desk!!
I have that desk lol
I guess birds aren't the only ones who don't understand glass. lol
I have that desk. And a cat. Hmm.
My parents used to have a glass topped coffee table that I loved to climb on. Well, as I was getting bigger, my mom was worried I would break the glass and get all cut up. So they took the glass off. I then proceeded to climb up, business as usual, and fall straight off the edge like a lemming. My dad can't tell the story without dying laughing. That cat is my spirit animal.
I have that same desk. I have had it for 7+ years and it is still going strong.

I love when his feets line up perfectly with where the table is supposed to be
Either that or he understood it perfectly
No bueno, Don. No bueno. What's next? Shrooms and David Lynch films? You, blackmagicfuckery bafoon. 
My dogs do something simlar with our beds.
We use the metal foundations instead of box springs. So when we have mattresses off to clean & just the slip pad on metal frame. The dogs jump on it thinking its solid, then learn its not lmao

lol that cat's never gonna trust that table again even after you put the glass back on. It will probably screw his mind if you put him on it like "what kind of sorcery is this hooman?!"
Lol when he tries to find glass with his paw
That feline must have thought it would make quite the landing.
Pause it when the cat reaches the invisible glass and you realise how accurate their jumps are, all four paws are on the "glass" flat.
You know what I don‚Äôt understand? Why we still have these giant, long, slow, GIF‚Äôs. It‚Äôs like sending a fax in 2018.

Hey, I have that desk! Hey! I have cats... I wonder how they'll react
Same desk buddies!!
Upvoting because I have that exact same Edison Walker desk and G15 Logitech Keyboard.
‚ÄúHey! Where‚Äôs the thing I used to stand on?‚Äù
SAIL!
I have the same desk
I had the exact same desk :o
We have the same desk! I wish my wall was as pretty as yours though!
Did you get that desk from Target? I have one exactly like that and I love it
*You're messing with my mind, human. Keep this up and I'll mess with your shoes.*
"What's going on here Kevin? Did you disable the table force field?"
I have the same desk but in black glass.
cats do the same thing.
My brother has this exact same desk.
LOOK AT HIS FRISKY WHISKERS
I love how the cat checks the table with its paw in the end, like: "..the fuck? ....seems solid..."
Our cats are twins. It's like watching a video of my cat 
10/10 outstanding high jump
Just magic!
Poor kitty keeps going to the human and looks up like, "Would someone PLEASE explain this to me? I'm getting not a little freaked out!" Or, "OK, whose been screwing with my stuff?" For those who aren't cat fans, (I can't believe there would be such a person) cats think EVERYTHING is is theirs. All they have to do is rub the sides of their faces on an object- or human- and BOOM it's theirs!
How I slide into them DM‚Äôs 
This  cat have chance in next olympiques ;)
OMG THIS LOOKS LITERALLY JUST LIKE MY CAT üôÄ she even has the same thing going on with her hind legs where one is white and the other has a streak of color to it.

I have a feeling this was not the cat's first jump.
He stuck the landing really well.
I used to have the same desk. IKEA? I can't remember.
She's so dumbüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This is one of the best video‚Äôs i‚Äôve ever seen! 
Oops!
.
That's my exact desk!'
Metaphor for those of us who jump to conclusions. 
Have same desk.  Cat confirm.
Please compress the file more
Do you reckon that felt like when you take an extra step at the top of a set of stairs?
My grandpa used to say ‚Äòsmart like a combine‚Äô
He'd be good friends with that dog that didn't understand a glass top table (when the owner dropped a snack on it and the dog went looking for it on the floor and was generally bamboozled)?

r/sneakybackgroundfeet
Bamboozled! 
If only we could teach cats to skateboard. Look at that perfect foot placement, as if he was setting up to land a kickflip...
LOLüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Is that a maribo desk? 
I have that same desk!
I had to do a double take because this cat is the identical twin of my cat. I even looked over to see if he was in his bed. 
This gif is single handedly clogging the internet. 
/r/catpranks
Cats are surprisingly smart, they don't quite understand whats going on but they acknowledge when things happen and something is different. 

I fill up bottles with water and my cat knows water comes out the tap so he goes looking for it and down the sink but doesn't quite understand what it is im doing.
I had that same desk from staples! 
lmao 100k upvotes in 4hrs
I have that same exact desk 
That‚Äôs just too funny. 
That‚Äôs amazing 
So much for object permanence 
My dude. I had that same desk. (:
Mewing language could help
Whoosh!
O used to have that exact same table.
Desk buddies!
I have that same desk lmao
Cat does not like this
I have that same desk.
Lmao! Funniest god damn thing I have ever seen!
Anyone else‚Äôs stomach drop when they watch the cat fall through?
Cats are pretty stupid.. in a cute way.
Same desk!
It's sooo close to being a perfect loop. If only the cat had moved back onto the box and sat there, it would have been. 
I HAVE THAT SAME CHEAP DESK!

ok carry on...
How is your z5500 system holding up? Going strong on 9 years here. 
I have that same desk from off of Amazon. Waiting for the glass to just shatter randomly based off of some reviews.
Cats HATE changes...this why!
This could've gone very bad
oml
Cat.
I have this same desk but in silver!
I had the opposite happen. She was so confused
Ugh I had that exact desk...not the best desk
I have that exact same desk!
I bought one of those desks from Amazon and I am glad I got rid of the thing
I hate that desk worst desk I've ever owned 
I have the same desk and my Cat does the same thing if I remove the glass.
I had to double-take on this video. We had the exact same desk, exact same subwoofer, similarly-colored cat, and almost the same color paint in our office at our last house. You're an office-doppelganger!  
Lolz  (my cat hates me)
That IKEA corner desk did me right for a long time
We have that same desk. Now we just need a cat. 
Cat.
I have a glass top dining room table where the cats eat their meals (only place safe from the dogs), and this video is giving me ideas
This feels like the equivalent of walking down the stairs at night and not realizing there's one more step
Sneaky human.
This desk is the absolute worst...
I had the exact same one and it was a huge pain.

Pro tip guys: **NEVER EVER buy a glass desk....**
I used to have that same kind of table! Have not seen anyone with it before hahaha.
I like the carpet in this gif, what kind is it? 
Wow.  5 hours and 102k upvotes. Well deserved
Man, glass tables are acting weird tonight.
Me trying to score
I have this desk. I don't think you put it together correctly though. Those legs would stub your toes. It was a total bitch to put together. 
So very funny. Love the little jump and the checking to see if it was really there.
I have the exact same desk, got it from Best Buy.
Preparing for the olimpics.
It's not that he didn't understand. He doesn't seem shocked that there was no glass at all. He is exploring something he thinks is strange.
Just wait how tripped out he will be when you put it back!
Lol. I have glass desk also and my cat does the same thing when I take the glass off. She also tends to walk and roll off the edge thinking the desk continues. It's a great laugh everytime. 
Swish
Good desk choice. I bought two for a U formation in my home office.
Whoa I got the same desk lol
Haha that's awesome
cat-astrophic failure
Oh my gosh....I had that desk....I had that keyboard....I had that speaker....

Did you get my stuff from my ex?
You know what's coming already, but that is still so hilarious. 
Over 100k upvotes and only 13k karma ü§î
nice carpet.
This is the most karma Ive seen on a post in a long time, nice one!
cat glass, also transparent to cat.
Cat broke through the glass ceiling 
Good thing he didn't hurt himself.
The jump test for jumpability of a surface or none.
good kitty gymnastics
Does not compute! 
"I SWEAR I use to lay on this thing"
Hey someone call natural selection we got a stragler. 
SO MANY UPVOTES
We have the same desk!
That cat is demonstrating scientific inclination by testing reality. 
I have the same desk but painted silver! 

But sadly I don't have have a cute... üêà üòî

I do have a cute dog though! üê∂ ‚ù§Ô∏è üêï 
Dude, he *totally* meant to do that! 
Persistent and smart lol how he checked to see what was going on by the end of it lol
Seriously a great fuckin desk. I've bought it twice over. 2 day shipping available on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Three-Piece-Glass-Desk-Black/dp/B075X41RLD/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?ie=UTF8&qid=1528767406&sr=8-1-spons&keywords=Glass+computer+Desk&psc=1)
My husband and I had this exact computer desk years ago. Cute kitty!
Are we sure OP didn‚Äôt train the cat to jump through hoops (in the form of a table frame) for reddit karma?  üòÇ
Nailed the landing.  10/10 
Now it‚Äôs an agility set.  It has two purposes 
I like how the cat checks three times before jumping and then with one final nod of confidence, does the deed.
I have that desk
I have that same desk.... Nice pick OP!
Hey! You have the same shitty carpet I do!

'tsup carpet twin!
I laugh every single time I watch this 
I have the same desk and hate it. 
I have that exact same desk, it was a gift from my parents. They didn't know however that it was not long on one side and short on the other side and is in fact a corner with two equal lengths coming off. This is only an issue because now half of my mothertrucking godflipping futhermucking closet door is blocked and I can't get into the clucker
I‚Äôve had that same exact desk for years, in multiple states, and it‚Äôs been one of the best investments (even though it was relatively cheap) that I‚Äôve ever made.
I used to have exactly that desk! Crazy! 
We have reached new levels of aww
