The dog looks like a drunk girl taking photos and I love it. 
Dog is like "you may have the ring,  but the heart is mine"....."and lap"....."and scratches...."
When my SO and I got together 11 years ago, he brought along a dog. After a little while he said to me: You know, if anything happens to us, you might have to take the dog because you have bonded so much, it would hurt him to be away from you.

&#x200B;

So I married him. Our 12 year old best bud is fighting cancer now but I am right there with him all the way.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you, everyone for the out pour of Reddit Love. And thank you, kind stranger, for the gold which I will promptly share with my pup in the form of belly scritches. His belly is shaved right now because he had an ultrasound so it is extra rubbable.

&#x200B;

The story gets a bit more heartbreaking if you can believe that. He was [declared cancer free](https://www.reddit.com/r/corgi/comments/afcfcp/diagnosed_with_stage_3_lymphoma_on_april_1_2018/) Jan 9, the day before his 12th birthday. 10 days later we found massive lumps in his throat...it came back that fast.
My dear departed Charlotte Cat was NOT a lap cat.  She was very aloof for many years.  But the first time she met my husband-to-be, she strolled right up to him, jumped up in his lap, and wouldn't leave.  We've been married almost 13 years.  Pets know!
Marry him faster 
Awww they both look like good boys
Pretty sure your dog is cheating on you 
He‚Äôs so handsome!! I‚Äôm so happy for your engagement.  Who‚Äôs the bearded dude though
The first time I brought someone home, my doggo went crazy for him. This dog loved me more than anything, but went crazy for this guy. So did my rabbit. The guy looked at my dog and said ‚Äúyou love your mommy. Just like I do.‚Äù (I think he to this day has no idea he said this)- and when he left I cried. I knew I was in trouble with this one. 8 years, one marriage and one kid later, the doggo was right!!! 

Edit- 
Guys- I‚Äôm dying. I just told him this and HE DIDN‚ÄôT DENY it! This was our first time in my parents‚Äô house- we‚Äôd been dating for- like 6 days!! And it took him 6 more months to tell me he loved me, even as we were moved in together! üòÇ I love him to bits and knew it way too early on!!!
Has anyone noticed how hot this guy is?
"Husband-to-be", might want to reconsider, obviously he's taken. 
Yay! Man is dog approved! The highest seal of any approval üòÅ
Your dog approves!
In my experience, Goldens can be great judges of character!
Consider yourself replaced and you haven't even married yet.  
My boyfriend looked across the room and asked me, ‚ÄúAre those two girls kissing?‚Äù 
I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing. 
Omg adorable!!!! A man who loves dogs is awesome in my book! Major attraction feels! Lol
Boyfriend goals for me. Has to love my pup just as much as me!
Looks like *you* have a good thing going on with that dream team üòâ
So cute! I couldn‚Äôt resist drawing you two while waiting for a friend. Hope you all can send update pics down the line!  https://i.imgur.com/UgQrGUL.jpg

So cute! The dog isn't bad looking either 
i‚Äôd like to take your dog for a walk and never come back
Does he have a brother?

Update: either the human or doggo. #goals either way. 
[removed]
Well who the could possibly resist such a gorgeous guy? 

Fiance is pretty good looking too I guess...
I‚Äôm a straight dude, but even I‚Äôd marry that guy. Holy Hell.
[removed]
Not yet married but your dog has already found a Best Man.
I‚Äôm slightly jealous of both your gorgeous dog & handsome fianc√© but they‚Äôre too cute for any kind of negativity so best wishes for the wedding & life together! Your dog clearly approves so I think it will be a good one!
They are good boys. 
You‚Äôre a lucky woman!
Doggo approved husband material
Both super cute!
That is the face of love.  What a great pupper.
Sorry to break it to you, but you're the third wheel.
Ahh the Mr. Steal-yo-fiancee 
Can I marry you guys too?
Your dog. I want him. Does he come with your husband? :p
Cute future husband and an adorable doggo? YOU have a great thing going on, girl! *snap
If I could give you platinum I would ‚ô•Ô∏èüòç
The dog picked your husband! 
I‚Äôm worried about getting a cat or dog with my boyfriend because animals immediately love him and I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll be jealous. But seeing this makes me so happy! If any animal reacts like this around him I know I‚Äôm with the right person because he‚Äôs so amazing
I think you're the side chick now :D
When the dog asks "Can we keep him?"
Golden Puppers are the best judges of character. They see the best in everyone!
That dog‚Äôs expression is the greatest thing ever. 
He has been accepted as 'dad' 
Can someone briefly explain why a dog has become a doggo on here?

Confused.com 
reddit loves the word 'doggo'
You must be happy with a man with like this üòçüòçüòç
Your husband is so fricking hot!

Oh, and the guy with the beard looks okay too.
If you don't marry him, I will.
I'll take one of each, please :)
Is fianc√© the word you‚Äôre looking for? 
Soooo...dude is single, eh? 
So handsome, you are a lucky girl! The guy seems ok too.
I think they are both very lovable. 
Your future husband looks like a younger combination of [Ben Barnes](http://www.gstatic.com/tv/thumb/persons/510380/510380_v9_ba.jpg) and [Nikolaj Coster Waldau](https://www.famousbirthdays.com/faces/coster-waldau-nikolaj-image.jpg)

Your dog, on the other hand, looks like God's perfect creation.

On both accounts... well done!
Romanian?
I'm so sorry. Your to-be-husband is marrying you for your dog. 

On a side note, I'm sure your dog will share him with you, you'll get some cuddling visitation rights. 

Source: Has dog that is obsessed with her husband. Used to be able to cuddle all the time, now it's usually a competition between me and my dog for cuddling him. 
You should keep them both.
the dog is so happy 
A bit Edward Snowden-ie. Don't tell him any secrets, he'll do a hero dump to the press.
"Can we keep him!?"

 -The Dog
Not a humblebrag at all lol
You knew what you were doing when you posted this haha. Gorgeous
Ugh dream life üòç
I'm getting some strong Paul Ryan vibes from this one...
I did not know you were a redditor, Lucy. üòä I'm a big fan! 
I think they're soulmates (him and the dog). 
What a lovely picture. 
That is one happy doggo
100% a keeper.
Awww
Your dog looks so freaking happy! I love it!
Your fiance is pretty hot. Does he have a brother who is single? 
Very good boy for his best man.
Win/win.
Hot
It‚Äôs so comforting to know these two have each other. My cousin is also autistic and has an assistance dog as well,  can‚Äôt tell you how much it‚Äôs helped him in socializing.

Gives me hope that one day that Jakob will be able to move out of the house and find a wife as well. God bless you! 
I used to joke that my husband married me for my dog. At least I tell myself that it's a joke. We're still married, though the dog passed nine years ago, so I guess he loves me. üòÅ

RIP BooBoo.  You were the goodest of good girls. 
Handsome fellas!! Congrats to you guys!
Oh!!! That is so adorable!!!!!
Good lawd your man is a smokeshow!
10/10 would date this handsome boi. 
Could someone notice that husband to be is drop-dead gorgeous? 
Omg he is cute!!! And so is your dog!
Good Lord what a gorgeous specimen. 

So's the dog. ;)  
I knew on our first date that my boyfriend was the one when he came over after our date and became best friends with my dog.

Living together with my boyfriend and dog right now is the most perfect living situation in the world. 
Handsome overload! 
Looks like *you* have a good thing going on OP
I love the dogs that have faces like Falcor from "The Never Ending Story"-- it's a gold Falcor. Adorbs.
I would say you are the one with the great thing going on. They‚Äôre both very cute!
i want a hug from this dog. 
YOU also have a great thing going on here!
I‚Äôm so happy you‚Äôre marrying that cutest dog ‚ò∫Ô∏èü§óüíñ
Keepers, both of them.  Lucky you! üòä
Are you as hot as your fiance?  
That‚Äôs a good sign though. 
Looks like you got some competition 
Romance+dog=easy karma on reddit
Mam I think that dog stole yo husband 100% 
They are both keepers!
My Aussie is a retired police and search and rescue dog. She's a good girl, but very wary of strangers in her space.  
The first time she met my new dude, she wouldn't look directly at him and gave warning growls and sassy "talk" whenever she wasn't between us.  
Then we dropped him off and she cried and pet my arm the whole way to the next intersection, where we turned around to go see him again. She ran to him and kissed him all over. I think he's the one, for Backup at least.
You're husband is so attractive I had to immediately look and see how attractive you were.

God damn a couple of 10's. 

Life isn't fair. 
Ridiculously photogenic fam!
My husband has been calling me cat thief cause his cat seems to love me more since I moved in.
You are sooooo lucky!!
the look on the dogs face, pure bliss :')
I think the doggo is in love 
Please tell me you‚Äôve framed this photo
Mr. Steal Yo Husband-to-Be
You are in one lucky situation. 
he's so handsome. your fiance ain't that bad either.
That is the happiest dog I‚Äôve ever seen :-)
I love this too much for words
I think your dog decided that he's a keeper 
I honestly cannot decide which is more adorable. Congratulations!
Cute dog.. And husband.. Nohomo
Dew Fuss.

We recently got a Golden and he is such a mega doofus. 
This makes my heart boop ü•ëüò¢üíñ

Awww the sweetest thing ever! You‚Äôre all so lucky to have each other‚ù§Ô∏è
Lucky person with beautiful dog and handsome man! Don‚Äôt be tired!
Bruh I‚Äôm not even gay or bi or anything (at least I don‚Äôt think) but that man is üëå
Is he going to fuck the dog? 
You realise we have a word for "husband-to-be" right?
Anyone else hear that song in their heads ...
I cant tell which ones cuter ‚ù§
Is your husband-to-be single? 
Are you sure you're still welcome in the home? I mean, they look pretty solid here. You may just wanna see yourself out...
Such an incredibly handsome man! And the dog is cute, too. 
I...I...I think I love both of them!!!
Name a better duo
Such a hottie! 

And I guess the man isn't bad looking either
Woof! ;)
To the top!  Everyone in the world should witness this!!!!
Looks like you are lucky on both counts! Adorable picture.
Your man is fine! Your pup is too pure Congratulations on a dynamic duo :) 
Idk who's cuter!
I'd be worried if I was you
Marry him! Dogs know best ;-)
I‚Äôll add ‚Äúdoggo‚Äù to my list of words that make me cringe alongside ‚Äúkiddo‚Äù and ‚Äúhubby‚Äù. 
Jesus Christ...
awww doggo loves him!!!
Love it! Have a similar thing with my doggo, he comes up for hugs it‚Äôs ridiculous 
You have a cute doggo. 
I can see why he is your "husband-to-be"; as wholesome as it gets.
I didn't think Goldens could get any happier. Turns out I was wrong. 
Congrats! You‚Äôll be an amazing family :) 
I prefer dogs to people anyway...
It‚Äôs bro-code. You wouldn‚Äôt be able to decipher 
If your dog approves that‚Äôs how you know he‚Äôs the one
They're adorable!
That‚Äôs how you know he‚Äôs the one! 
That should be framed!
Reee raaannd risses, er ri ream rister, rister Jones. Re gotta ring rowing Ron.
Aww!!üòçüòçüòç
Wise choice of fianc√© dogs are good judges of character 
Is it chilly in bedfordshire?
This looks like a stock photo from a Horror movie
The doggies eyes, just so excited üòä

HEY. Ur the girl with the badass engagement photo! IM STILL JEALOUS OF YOU
Your husband looks like Chris Redfield.
Lucky lady! You got two good looking fellas to come home to.
This is why my wife married me- I love dogs more than people. 
YAAAS!! My husband and I got our three dogs when we were dating and living together (yes, we're insane). They had his last name before I did. I have nothing but these kinds of pictures from before we were married. Best wishes for you both! 
Omg thats so cute. I love the dogs expression. Its pure bliss. 
üé∂you say its puppy love, we say its full grownüé∂
Keepers!
I love that Golden's face! So precious!
Your husband-to-be had a rather large nose and is quite hairy
That‚Äôs precious and frame worthy omg 
W o o f
Adorable, the both of them.
Looks like anyone would! 
r/animalsbeingderps
Don‚Äôt need a best man when you‚Äôve got a best boy! 
So cute
Is it way more than a random fling?
Ohh they both cute :)
I have a rule on importance:

Dog>Everyone else.

Sorry ladies, but the dog takes importance over you. Good boi is all a man needs at the end of the day.
They are both so handsome! You go girl! Lol

Also dogs sense the good in people, looks like you picked a winner! 
He‚Äôs marrying you for your dog.
Bobby?
üòç
Girl, your man is soooo handsome oh my god
Clearly he is a keeper
Cute bois. You're lucky

#notbeastiality 
Our dogs could pass for [siblings](https://imgur.com/gallery/bApFTlk)!
How much do you want for him?

You can keep the dog tho. :D
such a cute photo
Congrats! Seems like you have a great pair to share your life with! 
Me and [Mrs. Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2v98PGBZH4), we got a thing goin' on...
No wonder you said yes! üòç
I wish I could be half as happy as that dog is
Both high as a kite!
He looks like Pedro Pascal.
Oh ..?  Well... I'm here just masturbating and nobody loves me so fuck yeeeeaaahhh! 
That is one happy looking pup
When your dog approves then you know that you have found the right man.
Can you tell your husband that he‚Äôs attractive? Coming from a straight male.
That‚Äôs good that they get along cause if they didn‚Äôt you would have to get rid of it.

(The husband).
You got a cute looking husband-to-be
Your husband to be is the white version of my Indian ex boyfriend. Pm me if you wanna see a pic 
Yep, damn, you lucky.
Ever seen "There's something about Mary" 
Goldens.... Nothing better
Your husband-to-be has this great thing going on. Duh-dayum.
Exactly three months after your marriage he'll start cheating with the dog
If your dog likes him, he‚Äôs good! üëç
You're the third wheel
From the day I rescued my pupper he followed me every single place I went. Laid on my lap, slept next to me, sat in front of the toilet- you get the idea. The second I bring home my soon to be wife for the first time, it's over. He belongs to her now and I'm the boring dad he cuddles with while she is at work. I'm ok with that. 
I once dated a girl that had a dog she couldn't keep because of the new place she was moving too. I hit it off with the dog and decided to adopt him. Then when we eventually split up she decided she wants her dog back. Poor dog has been bounced around all over and now he's got a home and he's comfortable. She decides to go full-blown crazy and tell me I'll call the cops and tell him you have drugs in your house if you don't give me your dog back. Swallowed hard and said bitch come get your dog and get the hell out of my life. Wasn't willing to deal with any more crazy than that over a dog I'd known for a couple of weeks.
cuties!
It looks like there may not be room for you
Omigosh look at the dogs face haha. That's true love. So cute!!! üòç 
no such thing as have or hux or great or not, do, be, any relation any and any be perfect
I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôre the one with the great thing going on 
Wow what a handsome guy! You fiance looks ok too.
be careful, seems like he's gonna leave you for the dog
I‚Äôve always wanted to get a picture this good of my boys. Too bad one of them is the opposite of photogenic. 
Lucky you!  They're both really cute :D
If you like it then you shoulda put a doggo on it!
Doggo is precious, but the husband 2 be is just adorable. 
As long as it stays dog>husband 
Hell yea
Woof. You snagged a sexy one! 
The guy is cute too. 
This needs to be a photo at the wedding.
He‚Äôs obviously a keeper. Congratulations ‚ù§Ô∏è
omg Snowden has a dog
Pets know who is right.

Similar situation. Been married 3 years to the best lady and I brought the dog into the relationship. 

We were bartenders and slept together on and off for about 4 years prior. Every time I sept with someone else, my dog would pee in the bed. Soooo frustrating! The dog LOVED this girl and refused to let me sleep with anyone different without punishment.

We married and the dog is the happiest she's ever been.

Edit: And so am I. (In before someone mentions it)
If doggo likes him, he‚Äôs a keeperüòä
both are very cute :) 
Your man is the first time I saw someone else and felt like I had a doppelg√§nger. No I won‚Äôt post a pic, he‚Äôs probably slightly more handsome. 
I hate to break it to you, but I think that's a photo of your dog and your dog's husband-to-be... 
Promise me you'll never leave me...
That dog looks beyond happy!  Lol so cute
This dude looks super familiar. Maryland?
So cute 
At least your fiance earned the approval of the most important person in your life. 
Dog, posting on Doggit: THIS MY NEW HUSBAN. his fren took the picture
Wow, that is super cool!  Love them doggies...
Why can‚Äôt you just say ‚Äúdog‚Äù?
That dog is a real playa
What do you mean, *your* doggo?
This is so pure, you must protect him at all costs :)
Ever worry that he's just marrying you for the dog?
Dayum, your mans is hot! Good job!

Boys will be boys
Sorry, that's your doggo's husband-to-be now.
They are in love and are planning on eloping!
Aaaaaaaah the feels.
He‚Äôs a keeper. The guy seems ok.
Good boy
Your husband looks like Ashton Kutcher a bit. 
Dont waste more time, marry him asap
omg so good
**your husband-to-be is cute man** ; i think so
mY dOgGo
Cute BF!
I know these people irl and I won't get too personal but he yells at her in public, doesn't seem very healthy
When I first started dating my now husband, he wasn't a dog person.  He actually told me her liked his friend's dog better than mine and his friend's dog was an idiot ;) After he got to know my dog, he saw the error of his ways and they became good friends.  He (dog) would sit and wait staring at the door for my husband to come home.

He's totally a dog guy now and we have two so we each have our own good boi.
My now husband had a boxer when we got together. She didnt like it when he would bring ladies home and would make it a point to eat their bras. Not mine, though. She loved me from day 1. Here we are, 8 years later, and she is definitely more my dog than his. I love my husband. I LOVE my dog :) 
That doggo might steal your soon to be husband and you'll be single again. Look at that dogs face!
Your husband to be is cute af.
Marry him faster. 
It's not nice to call humans dogs.
I knew I remembered the guy from somewhere! I saw your post on r/happy a while back
Should have left it at my husband to be, would have been funnier
Your husband is very bangable. üëåüèº
Sorry hun that's not your doggo anymore 
Your husband has a beautiful coat
Congrats, lucky lady :)
That is the happiest pup I have ever seen. Look at that face. Ugh I just can't.. so adorable. My boy Max is my whole world. Hes a 4 year old black Lab/German shepherd. And oh so handsome üòç
That dog ain‚Äôt yours anymore. üòä
What a great picture! 
Smell his left pinky..

For me, this is like hitting the lotto. I envy that man, money gets me coke and hookers. A good woman and dog gets me super powers. This is bliss, I would totally be satisfied if this was the last picture ever taken of me. 
So cute! That made my night.
A man and his golden! Looks like my house. 
You‚Äôve become the third wheel
The dogs eyes are closed. Either pure joy or bad timing.
My ovaries!
This is how you know he's a good guy to marry
That bitch is trying to steal your man
Welcome to being the third wheel.
My at the time best friend adopted a puppy while acting as an extra adult on a Girl Scout service field trip. 3 years later during a rough patch in our friendship we wrote up visitation schedules for her since she and I had bonded. A few years after that he and I got married and she goes everywhere with me but is a daddies girl the minute he's up, she's protective but indifferent to our kids lol. She's showing signs of dementia sadly, but she always recognizes mommy and daddy.
cute\~
Fiance tested

Dog approved 
That‚Äôs adorable 
If your animals love him, he's the one .
He's a keeper.
Guy's good, too. 
That chair has a really high back Haha 
One party is clearly enjoying this hug moar! 
Doggo is just happy about him 
Doggo approved! You can't get a better thumb (or paw, in this case) of approval. 
Such a lucky woman. Both are adorable
Wait aren't you Lucy from educating josh?! 
That‚Äôs a good looking dude. 
Too cute! Guess your dog approves!
He has been approved!
Those are two good looking fellas.  unless your dog is lady, she's purdy
It's all coming together for you now, isn't it?  Lucky.
‚ÄúDoggo‚Äù is such cringe
You hit the jackpot 
That is one happy doggo
Cute fianc√©! And even cuter pup pup!
This pic is fake

I know this family personally and this individual is pretending to be them 
If your dog loves him, he's a keeper.
My boy dog informed me after 10 years of just me that he is deeply in love with my boyfriend and what took me so long? They are so adorable together. It took longer to win over girl dog, she didn't want to share. Now we are a big pile of cuddles!
Mah granny thinks that the doggo pic is hilarious AF LMAO!!! :-) :-) :-) 
I can't blame the pup. 
When your SO loves your animals it is the best!  The first time I saw my boyfriend cry was when he came with me and my son to put our cat to sleep. He got sick overnight and his kidneys were failing. The vet said there wasn't anything he could do and he was in pain. A couple months later we,  kids, boyfriend, myself and our female cat, were ready for a new kitty. my boyfriend went straight to a cage with a tiny,  sickly kitten and instantly fell in love with the little guy. He is now 8 months old and my bf LOVES both our "babies". 
It's a Goldie, what else could you expect?
Doggo: ‚ÄúLook at me... I‚Äôm the wife now.‚Äù
Oh my god. I want a Golden SO BAD
God I wish I had this. 
*‚ô™Stacy‚Äôs dog has got it goin on! ‚ô™ *
Adorbs!
I would be jealous if I were you.
Steal your boi
I suspect he is marrying you inorder to get the doggo
You are a very lucky woman.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That's a very attractive dog you have there.
He has been chosen.
Who knew Snowden was a dog guy? ;)
This picture is my life goals
Is this David blue wot
That is because your dog is a Golden and your husband is a human.

It was meant to be. 
Theyre both adorable as fuck????
Ultimate test for a good partner
\#Petlove
They both look adorable 
I love this!
You better make him husband to be quick cos that dog is goin take your place
It‚Äôs aDORABLE
Watch out. I'm pretty sure that dog is trying to steal your fiance. 
Now *that* absolutely MUST be a great guy... hang on to that one tight! ‚ô•Ô∏èüê∂‚ô•Ô∏è
That dog looks like the happiest thing in the world. Good man!
I want both of these. 
Aww, look at that derpy smile.

Dog's smile is sort of derpy too ;)
You better watch out for Mr. Steal Your Husband. 
Is your husband to be Daniel Radcliffe?
Breed me zaddy
Don't say to be you never know what the future is
They are both adorable! Lucky you. 
Oh my heart!!!
Golden retrieves are the best. This pic made me happy. 
AWW
Life partners 
I recently started dating a guy. I invited him over to watch a movie and order in dinner the other day. My dog wanted him to pet or touch her the whole time. She does this to me but she knows eventually I am done and she curls up in the other chair. It took her much longer that night but he was shiny and new. As he was leaving and after he kissed me goodbye. He said he had to say bye to her then leaned down and kissed the top of her head and loved on her. I think I‚Äôm going to keep him around for a while. 
Is that Mike Bierly !? The famous coyote DJ from DE? 
Looks like it's not just puppy love.
Great pic
It's sad that I recognized this guy from your earlier post on /r/happy
Zoom in on husband‚Äî zoom in on doggo üíØ
Now you need to put on some Luther Vandross and turn down the lights...


So much handsome!
Your husband to be looks so happy.

Your dog needs to trim his goatee.
SUCH cuties! You are very lucky. Congratulations on your engagement!
Jamie Lanister and the hound 
Very wholesome
After reading all of these comments I guess I should just start taking my dog with me everywhere. Mind myself a husband. 
*Fianc√©
So sweet!!
Men + dogs ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Great picture, and congrats!  Please tell your husband to be that he was great as Eli in Stargate Universe.
He‚Äôs a keeper. No. Doubt!
Tooo cute
Awwww, congrats on both!!! They are gorgeous.
My bff is always saying she wishes she could marry her cat. 
"He's my husband now"
Which is which?
They both look stoned 
Your Fiance is very hairy, but he had a beautiful coat!
Woof. Marry. Them both..
He is so photogenic!!
He‚Äôs a keeper. (so is your husband to be)

You are going to be the third wheel...
They both have puppy eyes!

Awww how I love this. 
All my dreams for the future in one photo 
He‚Äôs my husband to be now.
Is that Paul Ryan?
Your husband looks like Paul Ryan from an alternate timeline where he works on wood benches and crisp runs in the Adirondacks.
They're both so cute, congratulations!!! 
He's beautiful, I want to pet him! I'd give the dog attention, too.
Your fiance is gorgeous. Way to go!
LOL LOVE THIS
Your boys are both super cute.

Lucky girl 
Golden‚Äôs love hugs so much 
He‚Äôs the one 
There's just something about a man's relationship with his dog. My wife gets jealous every now and then 
My fianc√© and our dog have a similar thing going on as well. Sometimes I‚Äôm the third wheel. 
Looks like otzdarva.
Always under r/aww that I say that exact thing.

The first time my now husband came over to my house my then kittens climbed up his clothes just to greet him face to face. Ten years later our cats still prefer him but i just think that means i made a good choice. Pets just know.
He looks a little like Bo, yo. 
It's so obvious that your dog approves of your guy to marry. This pic kills me, his love face:) 
He already looks like a husband
They are both very CUTE!
My wife of ten years always tells me she knew I was the one cause her pup Buddy loved me. He and I were connected. When he passed I was a mess, she told me that he would want me to be strong because it was now my turn to protect her. I love my wife and I miss that guy. 
So stinking cute!
Dog: "I wish I knew how to quit you!"
Human: "... I've only ever walked you alone the once..."

My best boy (cat) eventually ‚Äúchose‚Äù my boyfriend after he got over the initial jealousy of him taking the bed. Cat hasn‚Äôt approved of any marriage yet and it‚Äôs been 4 years. How do I get him to move this along?
Cute boys. 
Definitely a keeper
A true sign from ~~dog~~ god 
So handsome üòç

Also your fiance looks nice too, I guess...
They are both very adorable. I‚Äôm very proud of you for collecting them. 
Your doggo said "this human is mine now"
You are 32
  Very cute. You in danger! 
A match made in kennel. 
Doggo approves
They both know it‚Äôs wrong
But it‚Äôs much too strong
They meet every day at the same cafe, 6:30
Oh god, they are both so precious 
I love everything about this. Congrats!! On the dog and the boy 
Easton????
be careful girl. next day you'll be sleeping in the couch 
Dogs like "Yep, He's Good!"
Husband to be.. where‚Äôs his hardware?? 
I am thinking of Barney Stinson and his uncanny ability to look great in every picture.
Awww babe üòè u/PsiFalconPunch
You are now the third wheel.
it's gonna be awkward when he gives birth to human dog hybrids :/
Very Nice Looking.....the dog of course
Who do people say doggo all of a sudden? 
Stacy‚Äôs dog has it going on 
A doggo and his best friend in my apartment complex look exactly the same...
Anyone else think he looks like Tom Keen from The Blacklist. 
This looks exactly like my dog ! Look at that smile....
The first word that popped in mind was cute when I saw both of them. :') Congrats OP on the engagement. You've a great thing going on. Have a happy married life! 
Damn, will he hold me next?

Your dog is saying, "can we keep him mom? I wana keeeppp himmmüòãüòãüòõüòúüòù"
Awww! His smile üòá
Wait until a kid comes along.....
Then it's "get the fuck off my side of the bed you damn dog!"

Goddamnit your htb looks like the kind of guy i want to hate but he‚Äôs just too authentically nice that i can‚Äôt help but like him(while secretly still wanting to knock his teeth out).
He looks like snowden
woof
Bo Burnham's finally settling down
Awwww
Doggo: "Yeah that's right! Take a pic while I cuddle your man... You'll be only doing this a lot soon."
The doggo‚Äôs seal of approval is paramount.
Wish this was my situation. What a lovely moment! 
They are both toooooo adorable for words
aww
"my doggo".... No "our doggo"??
Why your husbands tongue sticks out?
You know it‚Äôs love when your dog chooses him too.
You are marrying Jon Snow? Wow.  Daenerys will be so jealous. 
Looks to me like you've got a great thing going on too! 
Both are gorgeous, good job!
You‚Äôre a lucky human. 
Dayuuum he‚Äôs hot
Ah, my favorite position 
50 years from 2069. 50 years from 1969. perfectly balanced just as it should be.
Damn he‚Äôs soo adorable, puppy is pretty cute to!

Let's be honest this post is revealing all the suddenlygay guys!


*Don't look at my profile i am obviously straight*
Is that Tom Ellis? 
This is basically the part in the intro where the fancy yellow text comes up with his name
Good GOD. More people need to be talking about how attractive this man is. 
Fiance is a keeper!!
Two very handsome boys! 
Cute
This has so many likes
Best friends!
Don‚Äôt marry him. Why would you want to get in the way of a love like this?
Both are so cute get in there OP!

Now that's love.
Why does he have my name on his shirt :x
Well that settles it, he's a good catch.
Is your hisband-to-be single?
Dog: *Mike she doesn‚Äôt expect a thing between us.*

Mike to Dog: *shhhh smile and act like a drunk white girl!*

**Congrats Though This Is Cute!**
Girl, you are winning at life! Best wishes!
Such a sincere smile this barky fella have, great moment captured! 
Always a good sign when the doggo approves. 
Husband is cute and looks like captain sparkles 
Handsome hubbie üòã
That doggo might steal your soon to be husband and you'll be single again. Look at that dogs face!
You jealous?
You jealous?
At first glance, I thought your fianc√© was Kit Harrington. üòª
I have a father now!
Hello future doggos!
Your soon-to -be-husband is creating youtube videos, isnt he? Seems familiar, with a weird austrian accent. 
No he‚Äôs not - he is an English farmer. I‚Äôd be interested to see who you thought he was though! 
Lowkey cheating on you with doggo
Dog's like "can we keep him mom, pleeeaase?"
I'm a guy and I still think your husband is handsome
Your husband to be is ADORABLE. His golden hair is sooo fluffy
What a gorgeous boy. Dogs alright too
[deleted]
I think your doggo found ‚Äúthe one‚Äù congrats! 
It‚Äôs 2019 stop saying doggo 
he's a keeper
What's up with the title? Do you have brain damage? 
Doggo accepts him to say, ‚ÄúI do‚Äù.
Keeper
Keepers
You are very lucky üòä
Please don‚Äôt have any children. 
Aww, the tongue of your husband.
And thats why he's your husband to be xx great picyure xx
What a handsome boy. Nice dog too.
Twist: dog is dead and you just wanted karma.
[deleted]
I‚Äôd marry him and I‚Äôm a straight male. 
Is he on the spectrum? 
Best reddit post of the past bajillion years.
Man wish he could see 10 years from now. He would just take the dog, run and adopt or surrogate a kid. Another divorce rape in progress...
Looks like a real keeper! On, and the dog too. 
Please tell me OP is a girl 
Seems like a great guy. You should friend zone him and just have play dates with him and the dog. Start dating other guys. You want to keep him as your bff.
