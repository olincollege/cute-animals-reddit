This video made my husband and I actually do what we said we would do for months now, which is to set up monthly donations to a marine mammal rescue near us.

ETA: it‚Äôs an [organization](http://marineanimals.ca/) that helps whales and porpoises and seals in the wild that have been beached or caught in fishing gear or otherwise in need of some help to survive in the wild.
My first thought was, "what the fuck is wrong with that puppy's legs?!?!"
This seal is literally the cutest living thing I have ever seen. Like what?! How is this even possible??

Edit: After reviewing the clip >10 times, I still have no idea how anything can be this cute. Isn't there a legal limit on cuteness or something?
So sweet! And those big eyes!
That moment when you realise you are a seal and you need to start acting like a seal
I thought it was a land puppy at first. 

Nope, is a sea puppy.
Our planet is so beautiful, y‚Äôall. We should all do our part to protect it, for ourselves and for animals like this little guy.
I wanna squeeze it.
It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!
Better than how my dad taught me how to swim, he just threw me in and said HE‚ÄôLL LEARN and left the house to go get cigarettes.
Good lord, this got through my cold, dead heart
Well that's just precious.
Omg the instructor holding his little face above the water and gently lowering it, and then the little water sneeze/cough and then lifting his face up omg issocute

They look like giant furry shrimp as babies.
Needed to see this after all the Duggar crap I‚Äôve been reading
Do seals have any kind of protection on their eyes that lets them see better underwater or is it all blurry like when we open our eyes underwater?

There is no more adorable animal than the baby seal.
It was satisfying to see all the fur get wet.
imagine a human being giving a sea mammal a swimming lesson

I used to work at a rehab centre for orphaned seal pups. This is not at all how a wild rescued baby seal behaves. A normal seal pup is hissing and snapping at the scary humans. My guess is this is a seal born in captivity who is tame
Merpuppies!
What a goood buoy!
Aw i want my very own seal it's so cute.

Aww indeed.. Aqua puppies are now my new favourite

u/CrownOfRice17 Milky nadando
Did you know that seal mothers only care for their children dor about 10 weeks, but it actually takes about 15 weeks for a seal pup to learn to swim, eat or all around survive. So basically almost all Arctic seal pups have a 4 week buffer time, where they sit around and pray not ro be eaten. Not only that later in life if a seal cant find afemale in mating seaaon, they will use penguins as living fleshlights.

I have the pain of knowing these facts, so now so do u. Ur welcome

My Canadian genes tells me I should get ready with a club after seeing this cute creature. Maybe it's inbuilt in us.
Can it ever be released into the wild, or does it have to remain in the care of humans for the rest of its life now?

If yes to the second one, can I have it?

Words cannot describe how cute that seal is
I once watched a mama seal give birth on my family‚Äôs dock. It was very cool‚Äîshe jumped up onto it in the middle of the day, which they rarely did, and then we realized that all these other seals were swimming around the dock like a patrol. Mama gave birth, which took about two minutes, then maybe ten minutes later the little baby jumped into the water and started to swim away! And then the seal patrol made more sense.

I wouldn‚Äôt assume seals need to learn to swim. Unless it‚Äôs traumatic childhood caused it to not be able to and I‚Äôm just being a jerk
My brain like almost cannot even process how insanely adorable that seal pup is.

Do they really need to hold the head like that? I'm guessing in nature, they just get into the water and love with the consequences.
End of the day you must feel great.Thanks for sharing.
it trying to breathe underwater reminds me of my puppy's inability to understand things that they haven't yet experienced. 

the first time they tried to walk on the pool was very cute, but they figured out how to doggy paddle their way out before i had a chance to get in and save them.

One time like 25 years ago my family and I were on vacation at Ocean Shores, Washington and we saw a seal pup crying on the beach. So we drug it into the water and it would crawl back up to the sand. It kept repeatedly doing this. So we ran to the hotel and told them. They called animal control and rescued the little pup.
Oh my they really are water puppies. So sweet.
I would give ANYTHING to pet that seal.
hmm
It would haunt me forever if i had to club something this cute
I had no idea they had fur. That's adorable.
Is that a cute lil water fluff ball?
So precious. ü•∫
