What's the use in feeling blue?
I have that same sweater 
I see you also own a land based seal.
Puppy!
Where can I find that sweater, gonna need one once the weather begins to turn?
r/mademesmile
What‚Äôs the use of feeling...blue?
It's wiggling and wagging it's tail straight into my heart and into my soul
What's the use of feeling, Blue?
The Blue Boys!!
First I was happy, then I was even happier when the camera focused better!

That is the face of a good dog.
Call me an ambulance ... my heart melted 
I'm blue da ba dee da ba daa
The only blue thing is that adorable sweater!
He‚Äôs also effectively sweeping leaves off of the rock with his tail. 
Omg a pit bull on Reddit. 
The cutest staffy I have ever seen. It makes me want to adopt one! Unfortunately I can‚Äôt, makes me sad. 
What‚Äôs the use of feeling blue?
Some more pics of this guy pls!
This makes me talk to my phone in a dog voice, ‚Äúoooooo my gooooodness‚Äù 
I love when my dogs do this to me. It makes me feel so loved ü§ó

I make sure to always give them lots of treats after!
Pet the damn dog you monster!
 I could  watch this all day
I actually have been feeling blue. This brightened my day. Thank you so much for sharing. 
You are holding a treat, I guarantee it. 
Omg üòç
Happy doggo üòçüòç

Stop looking at me poop!

Him needs some lubbins 
I sat waiting for the jump! Happy pibbles will usually snoot boop YOU, if you wait too long.
Ladies and Gentlemen, the vicious pit bull
i swear dogs smile at us. 
I must say it's very relaxing to look at this sweet boye 
I have nothing against pit bulls and think they are kinda cute, but I feel like there is an active struggle going on on reddit to shine them in a good light with posts like these.

There is not a single week where I browse /r/all where I don't see at least one positive pitbull post somewhere (and the consequential locked down comment section because of an epic fight between dog lovers and those who hate pitbulls).

Am I wrong, am I just recognizing patterns where none are? or is there some attempt by redditors to popularize these dogs through cute images and gifs?
This has officially become my go-to for bad days.
It is blues clue. 
Dog got a Gucci leash lmao
What breed is this? Sooooo cute 
Don't leave your doggos in the cold too long, they get a real ruff idle.
Pitbulls are so cute bread. Look at that face man. Happiness overwhelmed. 
Who‚Äôs a G O O D T A N K
Ive wanted an english blue staffy my whole life. That pupper is adorable!ü§©
So  adorable.  I get the same look from my pit bull  every time a come home from a hard day's work. It is  the only thing that makes my day wonderfull.
For the love of god, boop that snoot!
My dog died a couple of years ago, and due to other commitments I have not been able to adopt another. This sweet face is making me remember why I love them so much. Thank you for sharing.
This is making me miss the hell out of my Staffie! I should clarify that she is in England and I'm in the US though. 
Every pitbull is named blue 
Staffies are the best things!
‚ÄúTell me how good I am again, please. Tell me again.‚Äù
Most Definitely A Good Boy 10/10 would  Boop!

'Ooooooooooooooooooooo' my actual response
No im felling good but love the dog
I wish I had made this video of my furry four legged best friend Louis. Made a lot of wonderful memories with that little Corgi. Wish I had a video of his rump shaking and his little blep with those big brown eyes looking up at me. 

Hug your pets and cherish them! :(
I saw a sign at my local vet. It read " A dog wags it's tail with it's heart". Shit got real for a minute 
Just what I needed
How do I get this as a Live Wallpaper?
For the sake of the children, someone make that a perfect loop
Seriously a gucci leash but cute.
Yes, yes I am.
It could only get better if it was a perfect loop.
what is this breed called?
Ever since learning about it, whenever I see a really friendly dog gif, I can't help but think that they have the dog version of Williams Syndrome (deleted genes that affect personality) to be so friendly, because humans selectively bred for it.
Yup. I needed to see that cute snoot. 
Looks like the pups in a fish tank.
He's blue da ba de da ba die
This doggo looks like he/she just wants to tell you "I love you!" I love you too, doggo!
Instant warming of the insides 
I have found my dog‚Äôs twin, except mine is a golden brown. The facial expression, eye brows, happy licking, tail, all the same. 
Who's a pretty baby? ‚ù§
Look at those sweet precious eyes. 
I just wanna pet that sombitch so bad.
I wish there was a perfect loop version of this :( I could stare for hours!

Human relationships, whether they are platonic or romantic, require some degree of effort: selflessness, humility, interpersonal skills, etc. Pet worship (or rather, dog worship as it seems to be a lot more common), stems from that person wanting to feel "loved" on the same deep level that which might come from another human, but being incapable or unwilling to engage in the level of effort needed to function in a human relationship.

For dog worshipers, all they have to do is simply "exist" and in turn they receive what they crave most: mute devotion from their pet. The extent of this interaction is dropping food in a bowl, buying the occasional toy, and going on walks with their animal. Its the simplicity of this 'transaction' that is what appeals to dog worshipers who elevate their pets to "Fido is sooo much better than any human" status.
