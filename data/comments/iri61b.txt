Miles Tails Prower, is that you?
Time to start the dog olympics
It looks like he‚Äôs cancelling out rotational momentum to stabilise his body during the jump. 

Clever science pupper. Very Newton.

EDIT: Wow this is an odd thing to get my first gold for. Thanks!
What kind of dog is that? Looks like a shaved Afghan hound. I know the other one is a greyhound

Edit: it‚Äôs a Saluki!!!
The greyhound at the beginning is doing the greyhoundest of greyhound things.

- Fastest dog breed in the world. 
- Incredibly good at jumping...


> Tries to get UNDER the fence by squeezing through it. 

God love 'em, but sometimes they just can't read the room.

Edit: Bonus points from the exasperated sigh from the lady and the sudden reverse when the grey gets caught/realizes that he can't twist the other half of his body that way.
A helipupter, if you will
Pup-eller?
Propeller tail
This dog has evolved
GET TO THE PUPPA!!!
Ok I LOVE that dog. I feel like it did that and the other dogs were like yaaa you do that. Ima try under. Got stuck. Shes like "Now look what you've done. Not under.. Over! Like this!" Boing

Can't believe you missed the opportunity for helicoptail
BOING!!!!
Only the 10th time this was reposted. Congrats on being top 10!
That tail propeller though.
Well we know who the overachiever is
Helicopter tail is actually a term used in dog behavior for a tail that‚Äôs wagging in a perfect circle, it means a dog is wagging in a friendly and excited manner. 

Also there‚Äôs literally contests where sighthounds like this jump 10+ feet. This is nothing
#SAIL
What a cool looking breed! I wonder what it is?
Iv seen this so many times and it still impresses me.
What happens when a gamer or mathematician/engineer is reincarnated as a dog or a dog with either as a caretaker! Needless to say good problem solving skills.
r/barkour
My old greyhound would clear tall stuff like that.  Was amazing to witness.
A saluki?
Are those greyhounds?
Anyone remember Tails from Sonic the Hedgehog??
Long doggo ftw
My edibles kicked in when he leapt and I threw the phone away.
Excellent lift and forward momentum.  You got this, good boi!
We've all seen this before.
Is that you Tails?!
Is that real? Wow!
We had a German Shepherd/Chow mix that did this with a 6ft. fence. It was like he was lifted over it. Just went from standing next to it to on the other side like it was nothing.
He just flexed
The inspiration for Sonic and Tails
I guess we gotta repost a little goodness, because this year is most definitely not good
Propeller butt

the power to weight ratio is intense.

Damn god forgot to patch this glitch, seriously the jump ability on some dogs is seriously broken and needs to be nerfed imo.
I uncontrollably said holy shit.
u/vredditshare
The power of tail.
A serious question, on a very small scale did that tail maneuver actually provide any lift?
 It‚Äôs tails from sonic lol
Im sorry... Your dog identifies as an attack helicopter...

I swear I saw the dog get a boost from that tail.
He‚Äôs like ‚Äöbro what‚Äôs the problem just jump!‚Äò
Awww, I‚Äôve always wanted a Saluki!
That shit would have killed me as a kid. I needed 20 years to feel comfortable around dogs (now in my 30s I love them). I always felt save around fences thinking they couldnt get me on the other side
Someone **has** to add a mario jump sound effect
Why is he not names Tails?
I see now they were not kidding.
He could have cleared more!!

'Literally a propeller...'

 hey, whatcha doin, silly friend ?

we don't get out like that!

it's such a waste, the time you spend -

you Can't make your self flat!

you gotta J U M P like Me, up HIGH

then Over TOP You SAIL

n one more thing you gotta try -

Turn on PROPELLER TAIL!

you get a little starting run -

your tail spins round n round!

n then - the Lift off - it's so fun!

so High above the ground :@)

so there's no fence can keep me in,

no gate or wall too high

Long as i got my tail spin

This doggo's gonna FLY!!!
