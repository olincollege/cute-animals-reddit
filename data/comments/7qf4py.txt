Way to slyly skip over those teenage/blunder years, OP. You're obviously the cat.
To be loved so completely and unfailingly, from birth to death, must be what heaven is like. 
Little hand licks at the end were very sweet.
Great, now I super want a cat. 
I don‚Äôt like cats.  Never have, I grew up with one I could stand but never liked em.  My neighbor was evicted a while back and she left the cat. I‚Äôve had to look out for the little buddy for a while now and I like cats.
There's just something about kittens and fat tummies.... I love it!
From fluff to floof.
I was listening to Spotify on random as I was browsing Reddit. A song called The Way Home by Magic Sword came on right as I looked at this gif, and it actually fits the gif really well. Well, the musical part does. Probably skip those wind noises at the start. Or I think so, anyway. Not really related, but interesting. 

Yellow/orange cats are the best, though. I love them.
My cat is just evil while this fluff ball is CYOOT
Precious happy boy
This convinced my mom to get me a kitten. Thank you OP
And still kissing like a kitten

A very precious purrito
When it hid under the blanket :( 
when it play it backwards, it becomes Benjamin Buttons
Lost my 10 year old cat on Friday, hope you all get some extra purrs. My football best bud.. tormentor of insects.. party animal at 3am for no reason. This gif was tough to watch but made me smile. 
Bottlefed babies turn into the sweetest cats. I have 4 I have raised since June. When it came time to post an ad to find them homes I got so sad that I ended up keeping all if them. Now I‚Äôm a crazy cat lady owner of the sweetest kitties ever. They are now seven months old as of today.
They grow up so fast üò¢
Truth is that they're always a kitten.  ‚ù§Ô∏è
Cat pro tip: get an orange cat like that. They are the best
I'm not a cat person.

I'm not a cat person.

I'm not a cat person.

I'm not. I'm *not*!

Oh, god- I'm... **aaaaawww**
Did anyone notice, as kitten grew, it got lazy af. :D :D 
This is the purrfect r/aww posting üòª
Reminds me of my orange and white tabby! Rescued him from under a porch. 

Kitten bellies...
A licky baby. Perfect. <3
awww sweet baby <3
My friend found abandoned kittens still attached to the placenta and raised them. It's not easy raising kittens, it's a full time job.  I got to feed the kitties with tiny bottles it was so damn cute, but damn that's a lot of work! 
I am melting
Is this a boy cat?  The cat is so chill.
i like when their eyes wander when their babies, pretty funny.
this is the best thing i've seen on reddit
You mean from kitten to plus size kitten? 
My heart just grew two sizes. :)
The scratches on the hand, all too real
If I was 100% guaranteed to have a cool cat like this and not some bipolar psychopath I'd definitely get a sphynx 
Love the grown, chill demeanor.
Do you use fiber one cereal as kitty litter?
Ginger kitties are so sweet. Lovely.
Here's my new baby, really similar coloring to yours, 1-2 years old /rescue.... Great personally https://imgur.com/0QJfHyE
It makes me sad when kittens are no longer just a liiiiittle but cross eyed. üò≠üò≠üòªüòª
Made my day.  
was having a tough day :( 
man kittens are great but for me, it‚Äôs hard to beat that older cat snuggle. the euphoria they express just from pets is so tenderizing. 
They grow up so fast üò¢
Holy fuck that is a cute cat
Damn. Someone‚Äôs cutting onions again brb.
Adorable. I love orange cats. My wife and I found a stray that was probably 3 months old. Young enough, but not super tiny. He was my 1st cat and he melted my heart. I wish we had him when he was this young. We did adopt his brother at a really young age though.
Such happy :) 
I love the purrito
Man, I love kitten tummies! 
My cat went from kitten to bigger kitten to woah wtf ur qn adult now
Anyone else annoyed that the pictures were clearly not in chronological order?
All kittens grow up to be cats. 
Aw
Cats are the best 
<3
I'm crying
I want to pet my cat so fucking bad right now
Than you. Too emotional to say  more.
Oh. Oh my. My FEELS. 
looks a little young to be away from mom :(

What a friendly cat ^^
Someone help my heart melted and now it‚Äôs gone
I'll buy it for 200 death runes
This is so beautiful, but it makes me feel incredibly sad and I don‚Äôt know why. 
I had a little cat that looked just like this one, but he ran away about a month ago.
This video broke my heart üò¢
They grow up so fast...
My eyes, they are wet.
That cat looks like Ed Sheeran. Very cute!
Please adopt me, cat.
I have an orange tabby named Ginger who looks just like yours! Well, Ginger is a bit chunkier. But Ginger is still my girl. 
This just made my day!
I wish you could hit paws and make them stop at 1 year old and never get any older for ever and ever.
I was considering getting a dog after I move to a bigger place. However watching that little beauty grow has made me consider getting a cat instead. 
I upvote this instantly. No hesitation
This is the most touching little video. So wholesome <3
"Holy shit it's another fuckin' day..."
why am i crying in the club rn
All footage taken within a 4 day time span. 
He looks like my boy, Sunny. I adopted him from a shelter at 10 months old. He will be 13 years old on Feb. 1st. He has an "old" meow, and I have to lift him up on the sink to drink water, and he has trouble jumping on my bed. I don't want my boy to die anytime soon. It's heartbreaking to watch how fast kitten to cat, to older cat happens.

MY HEART /u/brookefemale
aw man that cat adores you. this is so heartwarming.
What a way to start winding down for bed. Started playing Clair de Lune in the background and saw this as soon as I opened Reddit. Its been a long day. I needed this.
Aww he looks like my friends cat, who recently passed away after ten years. Miss you, Shadow. You were a good fat boy!
From tiny foot attacking kitty to large foot attacking kitty 
    üò≠ Just had my kitty put to sleep yesterday for FIP Wet form and this hurts not seeing her grow up.
Just like my orange baby 
This is why we invented the internet
I got my ginger & white kitten when he was small enough to fit in the palm of my hand.

I had to put him down 5 months ago. 

14 1/2 years flew by...and felt as short as that video was. He will be in my heart forever. I miss him so much. 
Alternate storyline: Man with shrinking hands adopts perpetual kitten
This is so sweet. üêà‚ù§Ô∏è
Orange cats are also known as house panthers. I have one. Orange cats are the best.
If this was followed by clips of the cat getting sick and then promptly dying, it would have been like a 1 minute episode of black mirror. 
Y this pussy look like Ed Sheeran tho?
Cute dog
looks like my kitten pretty <3 
mine is sick :-(
u/rockguytilidie
I didn't want it to end. 
This gif would be gold if the final shot was the cat sitting across the room giving you the death stare for no reason
My heart is full!











I freaking love cats
Come for the cats, stay for the cats.
I don‚Äôt like cats... but I like this cat. 
My girlfriend adopted a cat against my advice as she coukdnt afford it. 2 months later I‚Äôm referring to this monster as ‚Äúthe b*^%‚Äù thing was just an angry trouble maker that had to have things just perfectly or it‚Äôd howl and attack you. There were 2 days in particular I was a phone call away from bringing it back to the adoption center 

Girlfriend was then m sent to jail and since then this little cat and I have been best buds, even sleeps with me.  made the separation bearable in a lot  of ways
kittens are a natural antidepressant
This should be the official video for photograph by Ed Sheeran 
The older he got the .ore his eyes were closed and he became another lazy cat.
Vegeta what's the cuteness level
It over 999,999,999,999,999,999,999
Oh what a boi!! üíó
What a beautiful meowntage!! 
That's so cool. I just saw someone's little buddy grow up right before my eyes!
Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth? 
Ooh, heaven is a place on earth  üòªüòª
When does it become a dog though 
I tried to upvote it twice. 

By doing that it took away the original upvote. So I upvoted again. 

I upvoted thrice. 
Awww
The editing style reminded me of that ‚Äúvideo‚Äù in the movie, The Ring, but a cuter version. 
I can't even.
Very enjoyable!!! Where did you buy that jacket with a big pocket?
FTFY

> from purrito to cat 
I wish I had done this when i got a kitten last year, it feels too late to start now.
I <3 this so much
**I'M ON THE POTTY! GET OUT!"**
This was like the cat version of boyhood. I got to see this with my cat over the past 2 years.
Total in love üòç
Awesome
Not an offical cat until it tries to kill you
 It is illegal for something to be this adorable 
Who‚Äôs filming all this 
Squeeeeeeeee!!!!!
This video made me so happy. Thank you so much for sharing! 
Omg that fat baby belly! 
I know there's dog movies like Air Bud, Lassie, etc. Are there any cat-centric movies?
HAIR. EVERYWHERE. 
I've owned 9 cats. 2 orange cats. I can say without a doubt orange cats are the best.  
It's like watching my own orange cat growing up.
That was sweet.
Ginger cats are always the cutest, i love them so much 
Does a BIG sigh
This ginger kitty video had me thinking of Ed Sheeran‚Äôs Photograph song at the same time. 
This was great
too cute
r/gifsthatkeepongiving
This is basically my cat. Thank you for this video. My wife wants me to make one now. 
This is the kind of quality content I need the internet for... thank you, stranger. 
Enjoy the front page, ya filthy animal 
What a sweet video. 
The only thing that would have made this gif better is one last video of the cat staring at the owner while pushing a vase off the table.
Burrito kitty delivers :)
Such a cutie
It's been my day to see nothing but Orange kitties and Ginger kitties. I am beginning to think the Cat gods are telling me something. üòç
This is very nice.
Awwww
You can see the moment when it became the worst.
Just a cuddle monster.
Quick put a pet cemetery at the end and put it in r/unexpected 
You need to give homeboy a touch of that Benjamin Button.
Completely adorable. 
I was so worried that it would say RIP in the end. I'm glad
Absolutely Adorable!
OP, how old was this kitty when you adopted him/her? 
Most wholesome meme ever
I love him/her!!
That sideways look is killing me 
How dare you make me feel feelings.
This should be set to the song " forever young"
That clearly started as a burrito
Orange kitties are my fave and OH MY GOD SO SMOL AND CUTE I CAN'T HANDLE IT

erm I mean, manly things like... big guns, and fast cars, and explosions.

Yeah.

\**cough*\*
From little baby to big baby
Sweet baby ginger lovey Kitty
When does it start ninja attacking guests?
I love kittens but *son of a bitch* lazy old cats are just the best. 
Of all the things on the interwebs, this has made me want to get a cat the most.
oh my god, that's too much cuteness to me
This lowkey sad
Orange tabbies are the fucking best. (miss you dinker)
CuteeüòÇ‚ò∫üòç
It's like net neutrality posts don't matter no more and instead we give upvotes to kitties. Lol
I absolutely love how they‚Äôre born with such rich blue eyes
made me hug my cat
I have never seen anything that has made me want a cat. Until now.
How could anyone not like cats?
Well I cried
Orange baby <3
Those yawns! I love the look kitty has just prior to that big ole yawn; it‚Äôs so satisfying for some reason!
A kitkat!
Very cute.  Thanks for sharing.
I love my kiddos
This is beautiful, I am now on my way to my local animal shelter!
It doesn't matter if they are a kitten or an adult, to their fur-parents they will always be kittens in their eyes 
So full of himself.
Orange cats are the best. 
Need a relationship like this 
Makes me want to puke 
Sometimes I really hate being super allergic to cats
I have fostered many orange kittens. Reminds me of them. Fostering is the best -- you get the fun (albeit busy and messy) baby kitten phase without the 20 year commitment. 
Still a kitten. 
I have never seen a cat this friendly in my life.
They grow up so fast
I'm very much not a cat person, but that was pretty cute.
People who don't like cats need to see this. Everyone would be a cat person.
He looks so much like mine !
https://imgur.com/a/jbLpr

Even as a freaky little kitten
Something about orange tabbies that make em full of love
A furry friend for life. Enjoy all your times together, they only come along once, but they are beautiful.
The only glow up I need
Orange tabbys are the best ^_^
Look at the small bumble of fur
I had the luck to raise 3 kittens.  It's amazing how fast they grow.  Went from having 1 cat, to now 4.  Instant crazy cat guy now.
Yeah, forget the parts where it's a demon that terrorizes your ankles anywhere you go
I think this might be my favourite gif of all time. Thank you for this friend.
that's a damn cute cat.  I hate that I'm super allergic to them.  
I really enjoyed the trailer. OP, when will the full length movie be showing?
I just watched the gif 10 times. 
Lol, when your cat was a kitten it looked like Ed Sheeran. 
I want a cat just like this one. So beautiful and a total love bug!!
The cuteness... IT'S TOO MUCH FOR ME TO HANDLE! **dies**
This kinda stuff makes my heart so warm. Animals are so pure.
What. A. Cutie. 
In the fourth picture he looks like Ed Sheeran to me for some reason.
I had to go pet my kitties after watching this. 
r/eyebleach
They grow up so fast. 
How old?
Holy fucking shit! That‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all week! 
I‚Äôve hated cats my entire life because of aggressive family cats and allergies and these are the kind of videos that make me want to try and love them.
That's really cute! I wish I would have had more video of my cat growing up. 
That's the best thing I've ever seen
Damn I want one ‚òùÔ∏è 
I relived 12 years of life watching that gif :') 
I wish I wasn‚Äôt allergic to cats :(

Am i the only one that thinks cats are cuter than kittens
Those toe beans!! 
Ugh now I love him too
So soon they grow jaded...but we love 'em that way too.
Stuff like this makes me upset that I was raised without animals and taught to dislike them. I've never experienced this and I likely never will. It seems like almost everyone has had a pet at some point. 
All the friendly cats I've met have been orange. Is there something to that, or is it just anecdotal? 
My favorite part was the ‚Äúget out of here, left foot, can‚Äôt you see we‚Äôre playing!!?‚Äù
r/ragman_55
Awwwwwwww, my first cat loved to lick me back and I miss that so much. Love you Pooh Bear.
Those scratches on your hand when it was a kitten, you edited out the ‚Äòcatsbeingassholes‚Äô bits
I got my kitten when she was 9 months old and so excitable! I wish I could have been there when she was younger so she wouldn‚Äôt have been on the streets alone. She‚Äôs 11 months now and still no calmer at all! 
Woulda ruled my life forever after the first four shots!! Awww!
Beautiful 
Thank you so much for this TC, you really have no idea how much this video meant to me just now.
Why are ginger cats so derpy?  Go watch Cole & Marmalade on YT, Marm is the ginger one.  Gotta be the derpiest cat I've ever seen.
Few things on this sub have made me audibly go "OH MY GOD!" because it was so cute. This just did it multiple times.
Awww this is too cute
Orange kitties are some of the best kitties. :)

Easy karma OP, easy karma 
From Kitteh to Catto.
Oh my god
How adorable!!
My cat just turned 9 on Christmas. She wouldn't eat anything but kibble, now she eats anything. Used to be independent, now sleeps on my back. I think she's an alien cat and my old cat went back to her planet
I really miss caturdays.  Good times.  üôÇ
When do their pupils begin to change shape? When they‚Äôre kittens their pupils are perfectly round but as they mature their pupils become more elliptical. 
This may be the best GIF on the internet.

Kittens have such fat bellies

I love it

So sweet <3

I shouldn't have watched. Just made me miss my own orange kitty.
Kitten is cat?
I'm not a cat person, but this was damn adorable!
My allergies to cats are the worst thing that's happened to me.
What a beautiful testament!
I've raised both my cats since birth and they are 8 years old now. I've never experienced the type of bond I have with them with any other pet. It's almost as if we have grown together and I cherish the love and affection they show me. Cat's are awesome, sometimes it just takes a little time for them to cozy up to you, but to me that just makes it that much sweeter. 
nice to see an uncorrupted cat 
i wish the year was mentioned for each shot. just so we get the gist of how fast they grow.

I love orange boys!!!! They make the best cats

I'm forced to believe people that don't like cats have never met your cat.. or mine. Or any cat that is similar. 
I don't see a cat.  I see an adorably large kitten. 
I have a strong interest in cats. This is a cute cats.
I wish I had my little man from a kitten, we adopted him when he was just over a year old so he was already a big boy. I would‚Äôve loved to have seen him as a kitten because he‚Äôs basically a dog so he would‚Äôve been hilarious!

I read it as "from kitten to hat" and noped right past it the first 3 times...

He's cute. What's adorable is how much he's loved and how much he loves right back.
I am now a better human being.

That is too adorable
Our Cubby looks exactly like that cat and acts exactly the same way. It's always snuggle time!
The worst thing about kittens is that they turn into cats. 
Just gave my cat to my in-laws because my wife has bad allergies during the winter.  I‚Äôm not crying your crying.
God help me I'm dying 
Very cute cat!
I wanna see some old man cat.
That's a cuddly floof boy. Reminds me of my little guy Link, he was a monster kitty and loves to be around me. Get cuddled and pet
I've had very few moments something so adorable has made me awww and cry a little, this gif was one of them, such a precious baby. Made me hug my kitten.

Cats sleep, eat, play, chill, go out and enjoy loneliness without any complex.
That's why, I wish I was born as a cat.

Man, does it suck being allergic to cats.
I didn't read it in a pirate's voice, I just auto corrected me for my.   Then after reading your comment, I went back and reread it in a pirate's voice.

All it's missing is Ed Sheeran's Photograph
Makes me wish I took photos of my pets when they were young.
I think that just gave me diabetes. 
I'm still stuck between getting a corgi or a orange tabby kitten like this. I'll probably get both. Now I don't know which to get first. All the corgi puppies I seen cost around $2,000 while orange tabby kittens cost way cheaper (around $80-$150) for adaption. Well, my mind is made up. I'll have to adapt them around the same time.
In the fourth gif the cat kind of looks like Seth Meyers. 
00:19
This is such a wholesome gif. I love you for making this, OP.
Did that cat get cuter as he got older? Or am I losing it
I remember my cat was this little some 7 years ago... Now he is so serious and old hand...

I‚Äôm not crying. *You‚Äôre crying*
The scratches on OP's hands show the true love and patience behind this relationship.
Love the scratches on the hands when he‚Äôs in his teenage years. God those hurt.
Can this go the other way?
That cat is so friggen sweet i just got cancer! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I only saw a kitten
Thank you for posting this. Always wanted a cat but my parents wouldn‚Äôt allow it.
This is like the cat version of the music video for Ed Sheeran's song Photograph.
I so want a cat but a) travel semi-often and b) have annoying enough allergies that I'd spend most my time either avoiding it for fear of endless sneezes and watery eyes or mass downing Zyrtec :(((
Very adorable! <3 

Never thought the day would come that I would say I wished to be a cat...but, the day has arrived. 
This cat is such a good, sweet, and lucky kitty!!! This just made my evening! üòçüê± ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Cc√ß√∫u√ªu√ºu√π≈´t√´
This was beautiful! Thanks :)
4th clip in... Ed Sheeran is that you?
This is a great time lapse. Shows so much personality. I want to get a cat now. 
What do you mean kitten to cat? Looks like it went from small kitten to big kitten. 
And then again who made the first cat picture and posted it in the internet?
I don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôm crying now. So cute üòª
Aka from cute jerk go handsome jerk 
Still kitten. 
Awww dude
From burrito to cat
:12 AHHH HE'S GETTIN SO BIG
:15 AHHH HE'S GETTIN SO BIG
:21 AHHH HE SO BIG
Are you sure it's not supposed to be "From small kitten to big kitten."?
Aww he‚Äôs the spitting image of my Ugly cat. I bottle fed him too. 
ADORABLE  üíñüíúüíü
The trouble with a kitten is that eventually becomes a cat.
Damn my heart is melting.
I initially read it as from chicken to cat and I was confused but hopeful.
Dammit have an up doot 
Japanese pet videos are the best 
This makes me think of an Ed sheeran video.
Ah, the lazy ass stage of cat
Thats cute af *^*
/r/purrito
They grow up so fast ‡ºº ‡ºé‡∫∂ ‡∑¥ ‡ºé‡∫∂‡ºΩ
Why cats are such bitches to us?
Omg look at that cute little orange potato!!!
KITTIIIIIIIEEEES
This makes me want a super adorable cat now.
Daaaaw I love my furry babies, I have one just like this, ginger kittens are the best
Still a kitten.
Reminds me of Ed Sheeran for some reason
Makes me want even more to be able to move out of my parents home so i'll finally get myself a kitty
I hate myself, I read title as 'From kitten to coat'
Arthe thou feeling it now mr krabs?
Can you post more please?
Watching sentient corn pop
I have a cat right now that looks JUST like this! He‚Äôs 7 weeks old and the cutest cat ever!
Aww he reminds me so much of my ginger guy in his kitten stages! Not so much as an adult because he suddenly got long hair, but d'aawwww
I suppose it truly is the key. You're not the cat, you are you. So you gotta be so much endearment person. Not only for the cat, but because every body of general.
This is so great, I love all the shots featuring the chubby lil kitty belly!!  And your cat seems to really love you! 
This is true love. Why do we bother with people?
I could hear the purring
This is way too cute to only watch once. 

I keep watching this video, which is unusual for me. Thanks for sharing.
Do cats like these is the equivalent of kids born rich? Most kittens grew up in the trash but some of the fortunate ones, get all the hooman love from the get go.
From cute kitten to asshole cat*
Cute
I will always have a special place in my heart for orange kitties. My mother always wanted to rescue a polydactyl Hemingway cat in the Keys (we‚Äôre Florida natives) but the Hemingway House cats are not up for adoption. They are cared for by the staff of the museum. She went to the Keys anyway just to visit the house and pet the famous cats. As she was heading back to her hotel, she stopped at the pound, not sure why, she just went in. She came out with two tiny orange cats. My dad rolled his eyes and the came back home with Walter and Ziggy. She said they were brothers, last of a litter. They were so tiny. But the grew and grew and grew. They ended up being huge (20lbs) and quite furry. The vet confirmed that they were Maine Coon mixes (but probably more Maine Coon than anything else). The brothers thrived and lived long, happy lives. Ziggy died when he was 16. It was sudden, no signs of illness, and my mom was heartbroken. So was Ziggy‚Äôs brother. Although he showed no signs of pain or sickness, Walter died quietly about two weeks after his brother. 

Now I‚Äôm married and have a family of my own. We have two orange cats, Marshall and Ragbag. 
And then you got toxoplasmosis.
And now my heart it simply a puddle on the ground 
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen
That's the cutest cat I have ever seen!!!
They grow up to fast.
Does this post have 106,000 upvotes? LOL
It looks like Ed sheeran 
I take it the kitten bit off your toe. Poor fool.
And the "awwwws" keep coming.
More like "from small ball of floof to larger ball of floof"
I don‚Äôt know know why, but this made me super sad..
That cat is so well loved. I hope it knows.
Omg! Are there more videos of this little cutie? I so want a cat <3 
!!!
I want one of them rn! <3
The purrito at the beginning is great.
*Breathes in* AWWWWWWWW
I‚Äôll never understand how people can say they hate cats
WHEN HE STICKS HOW FACE UNDER THE BLANKET AAHHGHGH
The scratches on OP's hands show the true love and patience behind this relationship.

From little baby to big baby
This just melted my heart ‚ô° my brother and his girlfriend live with my boyfriend and I and they got two kittens back in October. They're growing up so fast I almost feel like a mom watching them leave the nest.
My 10 year old cat (who I'd had from when he was a kitten) died just before christmas, and even though I'm crying, this video was a great reminder of how loved cats really do have it all. I've got a decade cuddles and all his funny habits to remember.

I have so many pictures of him just looking chill af and life is good :) 

am sure tears will stop sometime.


/u/yaelmarche and you really want a rat instead of something like this...?
He looks like a fuzzy lil burrito. :3








I never understood why I loved this video so much because I watched it before I even owned my cat...

My favorite part was all of it
I just saw this while listening to Stay- Chvrches and it‚Äôs the perfect background song for this 
I'm going to downvote hell for this but ending it with shot of a shoebox being burried would have been hilarious.
This makes the feels. Thank you. 
God dammit, this is gonna make me all teary eyed. I'm not prepared for this 
I could watch it forever üòç
If you don't like cats, you have a mental disorder
Nice try, OP. We know that's a dog in a cat costume.
Cute. Too bad cats are evil. Go dogs!
I fucking hate kittens
How many native birds did it kill? Cats are destroying native fauna!
