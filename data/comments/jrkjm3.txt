I tried to do this with my cat just now. As soon as I made eye contact she bolted.
Such a patient kitty! Not even a move except a tiny tailwiggle. Very good assistant 10/10
I don't think I've ever seen a kitten so cooperative before. Mine would have literally told me to fuck off in cat-language and english
If you are wondering what he’s saying, here it is roughly translated to English:

“Put your hands on their cheeks on both sides.”

Other man(probably his son): “Neck?”

“Hold the neck, then put your hands on the cheeks will give you a tighter grip.” (OK this part I don’t really understand, it kinda translates to this)

“Even if the baby (word meaning shaking and being unstable, like babies usually do), these two (probably talking about the 2 hands) will help you hold him.”

“Hold his butt and put him down the basin. His butt will be here and his body will be here.” (“basin” is the best word I’ve got, and there’s a less vulgar word for “butt” in Vietnamese)

“The basin is long, so you will still hold the baby up like this.”

“Wash his body, armpits, neck, etc. His face we will wash later. He can kick around however he likes. Then we wash this part and that part, under like this, while still holding his head, right?” (The word “right” is used to emphasize here)

“After we washed everything on the underpart, put your hands on his butt and then put him here.”

Other man: “There would be a blanket here to put him on.”

“Then you wash his head, and you do this and that and he’ll be clean.” (watch his actions during this part)

“See, it’s really simple.”

“Then get a tight grip of him.”
Other man: “We would wipe him here.” (“wipe” as in using the towel to dry him) (they were overlapping each other so it’s hard to listen)

“Then put him down. Like they told yesterday, when you finish, let the towel dry.” (“they” is someone we don’t know)

“Put your hands under him, and put him on here (his laps), right?”

“Then we fold it (the towel probably) in, so he’s not cold.”

“The towel is wide, right? You take it, and fold it around him like this.” *showing him*

“Don’t need to hastily wipe him, let’s wash his head first.”

“At your feet, put the basin down and then take some water, splash it onto his head and gently rub it on his head to under his ears.”

“This part, the nape of his neck, and then this part over here. Splash water and then wash this part over here.” (The two “this part over here”’s are the same place)

Other man: “You’re really skillful at this.”

“Then splash water and rub it on his forehead.”

“After you finish with his head, take the towel and wipe his head. Then you wash his face, then wipe his body.”

“A diaper should be here, and you then put him where it is. Then just diaper him and you’re okay!”

“Really simple.”

They did say something after but it’s hard to translate and mostly talking about the cat.

If you made it this far, thanks!

And yes, the grandfather didn’t respond to his son. (but most the things he say is just adding on to what the grandpa is saying, so there wasn’t anything to respond to anyway)

**Upvote this comment if you find it useful, thanks**
We gave our cat a bath once. It didn’t go anything like this.
[deleted]
I friggin adore this not just because of the cat, but because it's a grandpa teaching how to bathe a baby. My dad, my father in law, all the men before them in either of our families never bathed babies, or really did anything with the kids until they were much older, so this is making me so happy that there's a guy in that age range who refused that kind of thinking, and how lucky his family is to have him. That's awesome.
[removed]
That kitten has been through the routine a few times already and it LOVES it.
After a moment I finally realized the ‘baby’ he’s teaching us to wash is a HUMAN baby, not how one should wash a kitten.
I know this is a stereotype, but I'm just going to say it. There are a lot of Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, and Korean American grandparents in my area, and I wish anyone would have ever taken care of me the way I see them take care of their grandchildren.

The sheer care, attention to detail, and pure love is astounding.
That is one young-looking grandpa!
I aspire to this level of chill
I'm in love with this video! Can't believe how chill the cat is being the entire time!
Kitty loves grandpa 💕
Her tail movement shows she's a bit annoyed but still pretty damn chill. My kitty would destroy me.
#If you’re adopting a kitten and don’t want them to dislike baths listen up. Whether or not a cat hates a bath is entirely dependent on their first interaction with water.

When you get a new kitten and eventually need to bathe them whether for fleas or just dirt, fill up your sink with warm water. Do NOT have the faucet running and DO NOT have them in the room while filling the sink. The sound of the faucet and them being unfamiliar with water will scare them. Bring your kitten over and allow them to naturally explore for a little while. When they are comfortable and familiar with the area, take some water just in your hands and then rub it against your kitten’s paws and perhaps head. Use only very small amounts of water so your kitten can have time to understand that water is safe on them. 

Once the kitten has experienced water on their paws, take them and gently set them in the water. At this point you can give them a treat to distract them if you wish. The water should be warm but not hot, and not go over their chest in depth. The kitten may not want to be there but if you’ve done all the steps correctly they will be calm in the water. 

Cup some of the warm water in your hands and very slowly dribble it over your kitten so they aren’t overwhelmed by it. You can keep doing this but be gentle with them. When they realize being wet isn’t scary, you can very gently wash them introducing very small amounts of soap. 

You don’t need to be thorough on your first wash. It is extremely important that your kittens first bath isn’t a frightening experience for them. If you use this method even as few as 2 or 3 times during their life, your kitten will not be afraid of water even as an adult, which saves you countless hours and many scratches when you try to bathe them in the future.
Is he speaking vietnamese? It kind of sounds like slurred vietnamese.
Perfect therapy cat temperament.
This guy is a GILF
What a beautiful relationship they  must have, I have never seen such a cooperative kitty.  Also - a very useful video for young parents. Bathing a new baby can be scary, and this couple make it look so easy!
That kitty is the best!! What a sweetie!
The man is speaking Vietnamese and as a Vietnamese myself, I confirm this video to be true.
What a cute and lovely child.
Soooo you don't wash the babies tail?
Oh he's vietnamese! If you want a translated version:

Dad: Over here you hold his cheek with the palm of your hand and kinda curve it up a bit and you need to support his neck. You need to use two hands to hold and you need to be steady.

Then, you hold his butt here, you put the baby in the bathtub, right? All of the butt should fit into a bowl this size, and the bowl's long, right? So if you don't want to baby falling in you need to support his head.

Then you just scrub his body, and to his neck, around his arms- and his arms and legs should be freely able to move and squiggle in the tub.

And you scrub over here and you scrub over there, scrub down under. And **always** remember to support the neck and head then you support his butt and pull him up. And you put him there.

If you want the rest just say in the comments
"oh yeah that's the spot"
-the cat, probably
This is too adorable
I thought this was a baptism
So most of these comments are nice and actually care about the adorableness of the video, but there are asshats on here making jokes about the grandpa eating the cat. To those people. STOP IT AND TAKE YOUR RACIST SHIT SOMEWHERE ELSE.
That's some chill cat
That cat is so chill.
If he’s that good with kitten that obviously loves and trusts him, he must be one heck of a Grandad. 💗💕
Why are there so many racists down at the bottom
Is he speaking Vietnamese?
I was pleasantly surprised to find he was speaking Vietnamese and I understood everything he said.
This is awesome. Not only the cat but showing how to bathe a baby , so sweet!

Plz swaddle
That kitty does love those head pets!
too cooperative.  looked cat-atonic to me
Next year we get a video of how to wash a cat using a baby stand-in.
Adorable, but what the hell did he touch at the end ?
Oh gosh what a chill kitty... Id like 3 please!
Not bad for a dry run. Lets see it with water.
Looking for the "deactivated cat" clip on the neck but it looks legit. Would be more impressed if actual water was used.
That is either the world's chillest cat or the only proven stoner cat
The number of racist comments in this thread is staggering
Loose translation:

Grandpa dude: "So you hold the neck and place your hands around the face. Make sure your hands are secure. Are they secure? What happens if they're feisty? So you have your hand here as well. Then you place the baby in the bathing area. See how the baby is placed? Always have your hand behind the head. Then you rub the sides. You'll get the face, nose, etc later. Let the legs be relaxed and for legs to be legs. And you rub here, rub there, and still holding the head, right? And then when you're done, place your hand underneath again and you take the baby out"

Other dude: "And you have a towel/blanket already set on your lap"

Grandpa dude: "And then you shampoo the hair. So clean, so easy. Hold very tight. Leave the blanket on the lap, and then you take the baby out. Then you cover the baby going this way, that way. So that way the baby isn't cold. Fold this way, fold that way. [something something] Then you put the water on and rub around, including the ears. Scratch this way, scratch that way."

Other dude: "You're shampooing very carefully"

Grandpa dude: "And you get the water like this and like that. Rub the head, rub the head"

Other dude: "For such little hair!"

Grandpa dude: "When you're done, dry the hair, dry the face, the body. Then you put the baby over there and rewrap"

Other dude: "Baby gets to lay there and play..."

[Something something]
I wanna Grampa like that!!!!!
I thought he was going to teach us how to bathe a cat I was really interested for a second there.
There have been ten comments already with the same tired, racist joke about being food, all downvoted to hell.  What a great way to showcase your racism AND originality!
This cat is used to being babied by grampa. such a cutie!
That kitten is in love with your grandpa. They don’t stay still for just anyone
That is the most relaxed cat I have ever seen.
I can see everyone involved there enjoyed it. Certainly the cat enjoyed it the most.
Even though I am uncertain about the language he used, I am pretty certain he was explaining the importance of the cradeling a baby's neck at the beginning.
Most cats have no chill because this cat took all the chill.
That man is that cats person
The cat is so calm and relaxed
That’s rare
Thanks, I needed this.
Epitome of lovely assistant.
that kitten is Cat-atonik
Best cat ever
That kitten enjoys the attention
This is aggressively cute.
That kitten is unbelievably chill. Both my cats were hellions as babies and never sat still.
That has got to be toy cat right??? That is way too calm
That is the cutest thing I’ve seen. Both grandpa and kitty!
Wish my grandpa(fathers side) knew these stuffs or ever tried doing it. I see people with great grandparents who are sweet and funny and love them. Wish I had grandparents like them on my fathers side. My nana(moms side) is sweet though and she is the best nana in the world. I don't know if you are on reddit, but if you are, I love you Nana.
Kitty be like: this is what I have to do for catchow
Masterful! I understood everything even though I don't speak their language. Thank you
Grandpa? This dude looks fucking awesome
Grandpa looks young must be a healthy happy man.
Are we not going to talk about how young and in shape that GRANDPA is?! brb... imma go to the gym.
I have never ever ever been more stunned by anything than I am of this video
Did he just grab the cat’s junk at the very end of the video?
Was there a reason he was pinching the cats nuts at the end?
Notice how his left hand never moves from the cats neck? Baby cats have a numb flap of skin/fat there that essentially turns the cat off when it's squeezed. It helps mother cats carry their babies around without them going crazy.

So not entirely voluntary, but still pretty darn adorable.
“Make sure you wash your new baby’s tail well”
I didn’t know I needed this until now
This is the most chillest cat in the world!
Ahhhh. Wholesome stuff like this fills my heart.
I don’t know why I watched the whole thing but I have no regrets
Now I know how to wash a Baby!
Kitty loves his grampa 🖤
He loves his Grandpa ❤️❤️❤️
My cat will give a very sad sounding meow noise if she has to have a bath. She hates them. She also tries to cute her way out of a bath but it doesn't really work
I’m not a cat person, but holy shit this is adorable
LOL it’s adorable but why did he pinch his penis in the end?
That is the chillest cat I’ve ever seen
Such a zen cat. The way his eyes close when he’s “being washed”
This is the most wholesome kind of internet I needed to see. That kitty is taking its job seriously. Bravo kitty! 10/10 Grandpa and Kitty. I’ll upload doing this with my kitties later. If I am alive to post it, may be missing a few limbs or a head here and there.
“I’m just here for a few scritches”—kitty
Anyone who’s ever had a cat, ever, is asking, “What did he give that cat?” 🐱
Kitty's like: "idk what we're demonstrating here, but  I'm just glad I can help....."
(Moments later)
"Extra more skritches behind the ears please grampa,"
Im pretty sure this is one of the best cat videos I've seen
This man must possess some sort of super power energy. 

I honestly would have never believed a cat could be this calm.
Cat, "I don't know what's happening but I trust you."
Goddamn he got a northern AF vietnamese accent. I could barely understand that.
That cat is too calm.. he must be planning the galaxies destruction
Can we breed that cat and that cat only and just pass the offspring around the world? please?
Kitty is loving it!!!
that kitty looks so happy
Such a good kitty and the grandpa is so gentle with his demonstration.
Wait..Babies arent dishwasher safe?
That cat absolutely loves that guy.

Water would have made this a much different video
Awww kitty loves it!
What’s he pinching at the end?
Look at that swag of the tail this cat loves it I aspire to be this level of chill
I love everything about this. This man. This kitty. Newborn baby baths. How this man is a grandpa. How this grandpa is teaching them how to bathe his grandbaby properly. How this Kitty volunteers, thinking they're being pampered. How this man has been gentle with this kitten and how trusting the kitten is because of it. I love the language. The furniture looks nice too! This makes me smile.
Why is he holding the kitter like a foot long club on Italian herbs and cheese
Is that cat drugged? Mine would rip my arm to shreds if I tried that.
Voluntary? Feels like this cat is high as fuck, to me.
Is the cat drugged or something? I watched the whole thing to see if he’d let it walk away or have it do some more lively movements but they never did. I’m just curious because the stillness kind of makes me uneasy, it reminds me of those animal carts people take around with unnervingly sedated animals

CUTENESS OVERLOADDDDDDD AAAAAAA
How can you train a cat to be this chill?
It takes a pet no problem. That’s a good cat right there.
Don’t forget to wash those baby tails they get really dirty.
This should be cross posted to r/catswithjobs
I practiced swaddling on my dog.
Don't try this at home kids, unless you're a cat whisperer like this man.
I bet he was one of those dads that didn't want a cat either and that cat insisted that he was the baby so that he couldn't resist.
Oh my god I just can't!
I swear that is the youngest grandpa that has ever grazed this earth.
I can’t understand a word this man is saying but if he made “How-To” videos I would watch every single one.
I don't know if I've somehow learned Vietnamese or if it's just because I have been bathing my kids and foster kids for long that I just know what's going on here but I understood everything he said.
some one give that cat an award
The cat: Moah phleeese
The amount of trust between those two...
That's sooo cute!
Kitty is plotting their revenge. Say good bye to all of your toilet paper hooman
dry cleaning is the only way to go if one is a cat
That’s the most chill kitty ever 😻
What language is this? I speak really bad Vietnamese and I feel like I understand some words but it sounds like a different language at other parts.
Why does he grab the cats wiener at the end
That is the most patient cat I have ever seen.
That is the chillest cat ever...
that cat looks so simmular too my kitten lucky
I thought the cat was paralyzed until it moved at the end
WASH BEBBY
Why did he grab the cats genetalia at the end?
What a sweet little kitten. She loves and trusts your grandfather. Hes as sweet as that kitten.  😊
How old is this grandpa? 32?
/u/oriolous what a sweetheart! I’ve never seen such a patient kitty!
That cat is an absolute freak
I am enjoying is quiet Vietnamese and also that they have a cat, like half of my family hate or are scared of cats. I have no idea why.
Our baby is due at the end of March. I hope it comes out looking just like this man's baby.
That cat was loving the tummy rubs
Pretty young grandpa that one!!
Thats a grandpa?????
And now Kitty jumps into the blue bowl every time Grandpa is around... ;-)
That’s the most well behaved trusting kitty I’ve ever seen in my entire existence
That cat is like all right I get to be a baby again
That is the most trusting cat I’ve ever seen
I could watch this guy give his cat a fake bath all day.
As someone who's been separated from their family due to COVID, there's something just very homely and calming about hearing your family's language randomly while browsing the internet.

Hug your family members if they're around folks, spend time with them if you can do it safely.

Thank you for the vid.
That has to be the most well behaved kitten I’ve ever seen. So relaxed.
His instructions were so clear that even though I don’t speak the language I understood exactly what he was saying. The assistant was purrfect.
This is so wholesome idk how to describe it
Kitty is adorable! Grandpa is an awesome teacher ❤️
He’s speaking Vietnamese btw if anyone was curious.
I watched the whole 2 minutes and enjoyed every second of it. Kitty with its little tail swiping and grandpa's explanation (even though I don't understand) are both enrapturingly wholesome. Thank you.

Also, that coffee table setup/stuff on the coffee table, so Asian lol.
I could watch this all day. The kitty is like awe yeah this feels good.
That cat is just vibing
Omg this! This is the cutest thing ever and the kitty is so calm and cooperative!!! Thanks for making my day a bit better!
the cat is so calm, it's like the cat is just used to being hold like that

"yep, another normal day with grandpa"
Okay, this is my first time looking in that community. And i didn‘t expect it to be that cute! :O
This is my life meow
This level of cuteness is way off the charts. Max power, maximum and higher. Tooo cute!
Bruh my cat would eat my face before i could even get to hold him that way
Haha wow. My cat would never. He tries to trip me going up the stairs. Successful once.
That’s a young looking grandpa.
That is a very lifelike doll hybrid of a cat-human infant.
Kitty just be all like "whatever man, it pays the bills."
Most patient kitty EVER!
How many times has this cat been the demo baby?! It’s so freaking calm?!
Dad: no we are not getting a kitty

also dad when we get a kitty: ...
I played the video with the sound off and it looks like a cooking show. The rubbing the cat in the bowl didn’t help that.
So where’s grandpa again?
For those of you who want to try this, it works better if you are in Canada.  At least the ER visit is going to be free!
That kitty is having the time of his life.
Clearly that cat is a paid actor.
His grandpa is like 43 years old.
This cat is just like mine, you can basically do what you want as long as she feels supported and is getting lots of attention.
When he starts scrubbing i can almost hear the cat saying “awhhh yea this is what I’m here for”
[removed]
Is that cat relaxed or shocked?
Grandpa? Damn what a gilf
I'm convinced cats never know what the fuck is happening but are like that one dude at your office who gets paid more then you even though you never see him doing shit
Anyone think this looks unnatural? What sedatives did they give this poor kitty?
Wooooooooooah 
This is the best, thanks dad. cuddles and my own bowl ...I’m so happy

Wish I saw this video in March when I had a screaming newborn :/
Adorable Precious Furbaby ! This is Life Goals right here!
Everything about this is utterly delightful
omg that cute is way too cute
What he doing with his fingers at the of the video tho lol
What was he about to do at the very end??
Everyone just comments about the cat. I think the more interesting topic is how the grandfather is passing down knowledge to his son. Dude sounds like an involved father.
What language is this? Also, I love this grandpa and his assistant. Wish I could hug them both.
It's all fine in theory, but there was no water involved.

Once water is involved, the bloodletting and screaming begins.
Cats tail: unhand me human

The rest of the cat: ah this is the best massage ever
I love this with my whole heart.
My cat had the same attitude and looked just this ): I used to hold him upside-down in my arms and he’d stretch his paws out, relaxed as can be with his belly to the sky.  He was the sweetest little doll.  He’s still alive, but he was technically my ex’s so he took him when we broke up... now he’s also planning on moving and leaving that precious little guy with his parents... true evil, miss you buddy
this cat has been passed down generations to teach the kids how to bathe the next generation
Give this cat a oscar
u/fzserri
My cat would have drawn blood .  Can I swap cats with this dude?
This guy is a grandpa?????? How
Some comments were like "omg, the kitten doesn't enjoy it coz his tail is waving" and that makes me feel... strange.

My 4 cats usually meow for tapping their butt. When I do that, they laid down, close their eyes, making enjoying face and softly waving their tails like the ones in videos. If I suddenly stop, they will look at me, meow in unpleased tone or rub their head into my hand until I tap their butts again.

Waving tail doesnt only mean uncomfortable. It depends on the way they wave and the others signals.
Listen this is so pure
My cat would have flayed me
Such an awesome grandpa for so many reasons:
1. He’s teaching someone how to wash a baby 😭♥️ I wish someone taught me.
2. He is so gentle :. Person is getting great instruction
3. He is so detailed. I don’t understand the language but he went step by step with demonstrations that i feel like I could wash a newborn, easy. (Mom of 2 here-it is NOT easy!)
4. That kitty def trusts him. If a kitty trusts you then you’re def a good person 😭
As a Viet, the home is that nobody understands that accent. However, I actually can’t
“As long as there’s no water involved, I’m in!”
Gentle grandpa! Trusting kitty!

Everything about this video is adorable.
Asians are beautiful, ageless people. Mashallah grandpa!
Why’d he pinch his dick at the end
I didn’t have a chance to do classes in person due to COVID, and online was hard to connect to. My son is already 4 months, but this sure has taught me more than YouTube.
This grandpa looks barely 40. Good for him I guess.
First thought you're Grandpa looks like he is in his mid 30s haha :D
I wonder if there's a clip on her neck to make her that docile.
I'm from vietnamese too!
 Did he sedate that cat or what, never seen such a well-behaved feline.
So cute. I watched the entire video and I don’t speak a single word of whatever language this even is.
"and now, I will use this dead cat to demonstrate."
Not pregnant yet, but it´s useful video. Thanks for sharing!
I feel like this cat has been drugged

He’s just in it for the rubs
When he’s teaching how to wash the head..... so cute
Cats probably wondering where are his bubbles, champs and chocolate covered catnip as promised?
OMG‼️
Grandpa should definitely write a book about cats
This is an amazing sight to see! What a good sweet kitty!
That is SO darn cute. And the cat is obviously hypnotized... :)
That’s so fkn cute! I wish my cat was like this... Have my imaginary gold
Can we do this with full grown adult cats who never liked to bathe and are nearly mass murderers??
I was impressed until I realized he does the demonstration without water. Amateur!
Cat name checks out.
I want a cat like that
I made the mistake of watching with the volume. My dogs are crazy protective of my cats so when the cat in the background started meowing they started freaking out.
And I thought my cat was chill
That's a young grandpa

(when switching to washing the cats 'hair'): you need to wrap him up so he doesnt get cold. You just put a towel or blanket on your lap and bring one side over like this, and the other side like this, so you can wash his hair.
You should have seen what he used while learning how to give a kitten a bath.
Is it possible to train a kitty like this? or is it a specific breed? it just seems like itd be so cool to have such a chill cat
My favorite part was when he washed the cat
Wow that's a calm kitty!  Mine will put up with me blowing raspberries on their bellies and tickling toes (to get them used to vet exams and nail clipping.)
This cat so cooperative..my cat is dead opposite
. here for reference
I love how it’s grandpa teaching how to bathe the baby. This is maybe the cutest thing I’ve seen all year. ☺️
Aww that's too cute! The cat is too calm i thought it was a toy at first lol
Kitty is actually enjoying this me thinks. And hearing more kitties in the background makes me think there are a few so anytime one can have undivided attention, it’s in a happy place. I know this is the mindset of mine.
Love that kitten.
I wonder how it would react if the bath were filled with water, though 😉 

This is not how one should hold a baby while bathing, though. Wet babies are slippery.

You’re supposed to put your arm under baby’s neck and gently hold the upper arm, so the baby can’t slip away.

With such a tiny bath, it won’t be an issue, but with a normal-sized baby bath, it will. But if you take the baby out like he does, the baby can slip away and have a bad fall.
Grampa? More like daddy
That's grandpa? Your grandpa looks younger than me. I'm 20.
Youngest grandpa I’ve seen damn!
Omg tooo fucking cute wtf

Wow. That's adorable for at least eight different reasons.

How is that cat so chill if that was me it would be a blood bath?
The cat knows he’s the real baby of the family

What nationality is grandpa? What language is that?
Reminds me of when I had cats and my female would literally fall asleep on her back like a baby in my lap.
His northern Vietnamese accent is top level.
Are the cats in these specific Asian countries just more docile? I swear the way the have them trained over there is amazing.
I’ve never seen a cat that chill
Or he could show how to bathe the cat.
A piece of cake until you add water! :)
This it it. Actually the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
My arms would be torn up and bloody if I tried to do this with my guy.
I wonder what kitties think when we do things like this to them lol.
This is beyond adorable I can't
Next step, add the water and soap.
Good luck.
cat.
Orange cats are so chill
I can't with this, the cuteness!!!!!!!!!!!
My cat would have destroyed him, his hands, arms, the table and bowl and left a trail of anarchy behind her
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen, my heart
I have a few questions about this video (and I guess, bathing babies?): 

First off, I don't speak Vietnamese (primarily what commenters agree he is speaking), so I'm going off physical movements alone. 

That said, he doesn't appear to bathe the "baby's" genital/perianal area at all, which would seem problematic for a newborn - is this a result of using a cat that might become fractious as opposed to a human baby? 

Also, the "baby" never gets fully immersed in water, and largely appears to stay in grandpa's lap, getting him wet instead. If everyone's gonna be wet, wouldn't it be better to go in the shower? That's what my parents did with me. 

Overall, just curious about the underlying lesson here.
This is wholesome on a bunch of levels. He is clearly a good father, going to be a wonderful grandfather and he is a wonderful pet owner. It is clear from how the cat is with him that he is a kind, gentle and trustworthy human.
Omg I took one look at the coffee table and thought "this is definitely in Vietnam" lol!!!! Sweet people and kitty!
OMG. I love everything about this!!!

yep this hooman finally lost it
Cat: i am baby
u/savethisvideo
Okay, I wish I had seen this when I had a newborn. Would have saved me a lot of headache
Very rare type of cat.
Dang, I’m pretty fluent in Vietnamese but had a really hard time understanding his accent haha
i guess im one of the lucky few whos cat will let me give her a bath. i mean she isnt happy about it like this kitten but she knows why i gotta bathe her so she reluctantly agrees lol
Cat says, “Feels like attention to me. Moar petting, pliz.”
One could argue in favor of this being r/dadreflexes
that is a very chill kitty
That cat is living his best life.
Ahhhhh pampered kitty lol
He forgot to wash the kittys tail :0
I've literally seen my grandma do this to like 5 of my cousins, can vouch. 10/10.😅👌
That wouldve been so weird without an explanation
That cat is chill.
How is this cat so chill??
r/thisismylifemeow
How the fuck is it voluntary, its a cat. It can't just ask you to bathe it LMAO.
how? how is he not dead?
Voted #1 place to work on catgigs.org
A cat acting that chill is actually a sign of extreme distress
kitty looks waved af
This makes me happy
this guy makes it look good but that won't work on an adult cat. adult cats won't lay on their back for long. the key to bathing a cat is to use warm water and not get the cat's head wet. bathe the body first then a little bit of the head and not get any water in its ears. if a cat doesn't have bad experiences with bathing, you can do it each time. have the cat stand in the tub and use a large cup to pour water on it. i use the fish shaped shampoo for kids. i don't use pet shampoo. 

also same with dogs but i don't have one. why do dogs hate bathing? probably because people fuck them up during the bath with cold water, soap in the eyes and water in the ears.

He is so gentle with the cat and awesome video!
Grandpa is younger than me I guess

Read how to bathe a baby. Watched how to prepare dinner.
Made my entire week, and gave me much joy. Thank you for sharing this lovely video.
Might I please be your cat? One day is all I ask.
You'd have to sedate my cat before she'd ever let you do this.
I looked over at my own cat, and he was waxing his wiener with one leg *cocked* up in the air. Stopped momentarily to look at me, and got back at it.
He must have kids.  My sister used to carry our cat around so much that she eventually just learned to stop resisting.
Grandpa you are doing a great job.
It's not so easy to bathe a baby but you are doing all alone ...no need for any assist...

Love you grandpa
MOST CHILL CAT EVER!
that is the chillest cat i have ever seen
How is it that calm?!
I want him
My cat would have taken a chunk out of me for trying that. That cat is exceptional!
Perfect little bath kit
At first I assumed there was water and I did not understand how that was going to end well. That cat is loving it, though. Adorable.
This is the perfect cat
Omg this is so cute!!!  The kitty loves it lol.
How...
The cat is a paid actor.
Kitty once it's over: "I don't think they got it. Show them again."
A very good boi
That is one Extremely Chill and adorable kitten!
at first i thought it was a fake kitty bc it was so still lmao
Omg. This is the chillest cat ever
r/thisismylifenow
“Look at me. I am the baby now.”
cats come with self-cleaning
What do you do if the baby doesn’t wag its tail like this during the bath?
BUT HOW? Please just tell me. There’s no way this is just, “his nature”. HOW!?!
Mèo OP xinh thế, ông của OP cũng wholesome nữa :>
If The Dude was a cat
Imma Shane Dawson on that cat
My south viet ears could never
Cat is vibing
I see a baby what’s the joke?
Cat: man, I love it when he does this!
Bingus with hair 😳
I cant understand how the cat can be so cute. I just can't!!!!
This belong to the top for this sub
Omg this is so adorable
This is the sweetest thing I’ve seen all week.  :)
Great work.  This was harder to figure out than I anticipated...
He’s enjoying it
/u/vredditshare
Real magic.
Cute
I'm baby
That volunteer assistant appears to be... catatonic.
Orange cats are chill as fuck.
Can anyone do some translation for an American who has no knowledge of this language?
That’s one hairy baby!
What is the name of the song/singer at the beginning of the video? it sounds so cool
I just saw the man's arms and legs at first and was sure he was under 20 yo
This is a lie, no cat is this well behaved or likes water! FAKENEWS! Lol
Oh cool, a ragdoll cat.
I adore the way how this kitty cooperates ❤️❤️
This is the most zen kitty I've ever witnessed. What a cutie!
What a good kitty that is!
Omg so cute
what do you do when the baby keeps flicking their tail around??
I’ve never seen a cat so content with being held like that. If I tried to hold mine like that it would be World War III
lmao he pinches his weewee at the end there
I can’t believe my eyes
What a zen cat. I would lose a limb if I tried to do this to either of my cats.
I had a cat like this a while back. Huge ginger striped cat that loved water! Sadly he went missing a year or so back, but his memory(and the two kittens he helped raise) live on.
Gingers are so tolerant and laid back!
That cat is one happy baby. Grandpa's favorite forcsure.
What did he grab at the very end!?
What a good kitty cat!
That cat is in a euphoric slumber. I'm jealous
u/savethevideo
Is the cat drugged?
Did he at the end squeeze what I think he squeezed ?
Good stunt kitty
That little should be hired as an actor she full turned into a baby
u/savethisvideo
First I thought the cat was paralyzed... but according to the tail and the end it’s not. Really incredible kitty!
I know he’s speaking another language but I could swear one of the things he said was “no this is a cat”
Omg 😻
What are we missing did he like hotbox the cat with cat nip
An Acuphase remote control.
Kitty is calm, like a zen cat!
That cat looked scared as fuck.
Yeah I think to them puking on you means they like you. Either they thought u might want to share or they just came to you cuz they didn't feel good. My cats do that, gets them some extra attention. Human attention is the only thing mine really seem to care about.
That kitty is loving life
Cat: I'm baby
This is unreal
I would pay to have him try this with any of my cats.
Awwww
u/Savethisvideo
What kind of voodoo is this? Clearly that cat is under some sort of spell. If I tried this with my cat I'd be pulling back a bloody stump.
What did he poke at the end of the Video?
What a team :3
Magic man...
I'm sorry, did you say GRANDPA??
Such an obedient baby oh my god I love it
That cat is so docile!
What a good cat. Not even annoyed one bit. Even cracks a smile.

Truly a precious baby to be had.
Jesus what Vietnamese Accent is this? I am Vietnamese and I understood like 5 words out of that. Is that just a regular Bac accent?
i wish they have a youtube channel (˃̣̣̣̣︿˂̣̣̣̣ )
my cat went crazy, never again
Never seen such a patient kitty like this one. What a cutie!
AWWWW
Awww the little tail wiggle, little kitty is having the time of his life, so relaxed
That cat is chill af. Good kitty
So... where can we see more videos of this grandpa and kitty team? I could watch him demo baby care with that kitty for EVER.
My cat can be a feisty asshole at times but he loves being held like that for some reason.
well. that is just dang cute, aint it!?
Best kitto award goes to...
“voluntary”
Hooman, don't forget to pay my cast!
The cat is very cooperative and obedient! This is so cute!
I love the Vietnamese
My cat stays in my hands literally 3 second before going berserk like he's going to be thrown into a vulcano full of dogs.
Such a patient kitty!
Edit: deleted for the sake of humanity
Where can I get one of those fake baths? That looked relaxing.
Can we please get a transcript of what he’s saying? I’ve got a dirty baby here and I don’t know what to do.
Sexy grandpa and cute kitty
That kitty takes its job as a teaching assistant very seriously.  Good kitty!
/u/vredditshare
That is one chill cat
amazing
The kitty is like "Yeah this is fine"
💯% wholesome masculinity
are we going to find out this cat is paralyzed or otherwise disabled as it often seems in weird cute videos?
Next level asmr tbh

Is this cat drugged? My cats would be all wiggles and scratches hahah
Grandpa?
How is this possible?

Why did he pinch it's pee pee at the end?

I is baby.
I want to be bathed by this man.
It's all good until he shows them the priest method in the last frame.
I think I can do this with one of my cats but the other one will turn into a big ball of muscle.
This so cute! He looks like one of my cats too which makes it extra sweet 😻
He looks 30
I wish this cat would show my baby how to be so still and calm in the bath. Those new parents are in for a surprise!
Lol i don’t understand what he said but I’m 100% sure he said you “don’t have to waste so much damn water and make a fuss about it”
This is the epitome of wholesome right here. Grandpa sharing his knowledge of caring for children, and kitty cat obviously being cherished and loved by him to be so calm and cooperative during the whole demonstration. Made me smile the whole time.
Sir, I think your cat is broken.
Are you thinking, what I’m thinking...
He's just loving every second of it. He's in heaven. Check out his tail. You just know what kind of relationship this cat has with his dad. Soo sweet to watch! Ty for sharing!
r/catswithjobs
I wonder if he's got her scruff pulled up in between his fingers there. Those tail swats seem to indicate that she's a bit annoyed, but is to incapacitated to do anything about it.
I can watch this all day.
AWWWWW YISSSSSSS SPAAAAAA
You do what you must to not be turned into kitten stew.
