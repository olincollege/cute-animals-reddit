Such a regal girl!
What got her Angy tho?
She’s absolutely beautiful!
<3 Mine is 20 and I think today is the end :( She was doing really well but has just gone down hill in the last few weeks (Kidneys) :(

Give your girl the biggest hug from me!

\*edit to add picture\*

This picture from last Friday of her -  [https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/idzyvg/returning\_from\_a\_drink\_out\_of\_the\_birdbath\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/idzyvg/returning_from_a_drink_out_of_the_birdbath_this/)  <3

Also thank-you for the kind comments, I wasn't expecting it, i do keep tearing up at my computer reading them but it is really very appreciated.
She looks extremly good and healthy for a 22 year old cat.. god bless 


My cat is also 22 but looks like a walking bag of bones :( I love her so much..
If Dame Maggie Smith were a cat.
Her majesty
She has clearly has an excellent life
She looks like she is judging you for putting it up on Reddit.
22 years old, and still sick of your shit.
It's crazy how a cat is older than me
She looks like a grumpy grandma lol. Still cute tho. :')
what breed is she?
r/SupermodelCats !!
She's beautiful, but she looks like she had enough of your shit about 21 years ago.
This is the first cat over 20 where I thought she in no way looks her age.
Cherish that queen while you can :)
Beautiful kitty. The grouchy face, fluff, and green eyes remind me of my own 20 since passed cat.

Give her many kisses and treats for me!
The judgement being dished out by those eyes
Our cat, Poppy is 17.  Early kidney stage disease. Lots of purrs and cuddles from her to you.
ITT: A surprising number of karma-farming bots. They steal and repost other comments, a few minutes later. (Usually completely out of context, but sometimes it's not obvious unless you already read the one they stole.)

The dead giveaway is they are all day-old accounts.
What breed is she ?
Wow, that cat looks fantastic for her age. You could tell me she's 12 and I'd believe you.
That is a very dignified look.
"how dare you tell them my age"
McGonagall?
I was just thinking yesterday about how 20 seems to be the max age that both dogs and cats live to. In this case I guess I was wrong. Most 20 year old cats and dogs look like they came out of the pet sematary but this cat only looks 10-12 maybe.
Hold up

That's 154 cat years



😐
Strong and sassy. Someone should paint her.
She's gorgeous and that look is a bit sassy! 🥰😻
She’s like Doom guy and John Wick. Literally too angry to die.
That is a very salty cat.
She looks amazing for 22! You clearly took very good care of her.
She's probably so tired of your shit by now 😅
This cat’s face says “i’ve seen some shit, and i’m not tolerating yours.”
My girl is 22 as well and looks nearly as judgmental.
You’re so lucky to have her for so long, I lost my baby at 19. She’s beautiful
I REFUSE TO DIE!
She is waiting for you to die first
That looks like the cat has lived a long life off of pure undying hatred from those eyes.
Too pissed to die.
Cat has seen things.
She be like..."when u gonna die, hooman"
Damn that cat is older than me
she doesn't look a day over 5. what a beauty :)
Hate will keep her alive.
_"For 22 years, I have been telling you NOT to take pictures of me. 22 years."_
So much attitude!  I love her!!!
r/angrycatpics
22 human years ? Sorry I am total noob. I am gathering info in getting cat for myself.
She is such a dignified cat...
She's beautiful
She seems so wise!!!!!
Such a majestic girl! 😍
She is beautiful.. and a warrior I might add twenty two years!? I hope my little lady gives me that much time she's 7 right now!
She has an uncanny resemblance to our family cat who lived well into her 20’s — also had a bit of a sour look but was an angel :)
Very pretty girl. I lost my first cat last year at the ripe old age of 19
Oh gosh. She reminds me so much of my senior kitty who passed last year at 18 years old. Please give her a cuddle for me. Such a lovely lady.
Is that floofen fresh brush job?
Still judging you too! Gorgeous girl, and I love her "not impressed with your nonsense" face.
In three more years ur cat will be able to get a rental car. Also this cat has been on this earth longer than me and idk why that feels so weird
That is Minerva McGonagall!
That cat lived through 9/11. It never forgets.
Any photos from when she was a kitten?
Such a lovely pussycat
What kind of food does she eat? She is a really pretty cat.
What an angel, hopefully my two boys will be with me for that long, 10 and 12 at the moment.
She looks like she’s seen some things.
Look like she's saying "Ya, because I have to make sure you don't do anything stupid."
22 years and she still isn't impressed by you...
She looks like she’s saying “ive been with this human for 22yrs. I’m sick of their shit.” Lmaoooooo.
Be thankful for your baby every day! I thought for sure I would have my beautiful boy at least another decade but I had to let him go when he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure. It broke my heart so much that I couldn’t hold him like I usually could because he wasn’t able to breathe comfortably but he would let me until he couldn’t you know? Hardest time of my entire life to lose him, I will ALWAYS love him
Looks like like my baby girl, Miranda. She's 8. I'm 71. If we can hang in there until she's 22, I'd be 85. I'd be good with that!
And after all of these years, she still hates your guts.  j/k She looks great!
She is gorgeous. Love, love, love.
Wow!!! So lucky, animals really should live longer it’s so sad to lose them!
She looks pretty young not gonna lie.
She looks like she's done with your shit. 
But tbh she looks beautiful for her age.
Omg i wonder what breed she is. My cat looks exactly the same and she's about to be 14!
Aww my cat of 22 years just died last week 😢
I can only hope my kitty is around so long! I'm happy for you
She is so cute!
What do you feed her???
/r/KittyTailWrap
I am.plaxing you under arrest for floof of the highest order
It feels weird to know a cat is older than me.
Why hasn’t anyone asked WHAT DOES SHE EAT??
She looks delightfully grumpy
This cat has some ancient cat wisdom for the kittens.
Not..very impressed with the current state of things is she.
What cats can live that long? I didnt know
I just had to put my baby of 23 years in March. The one thing that makes me happy is that i did cherish all the moments with him.
She's giving you the look, "Why haven't you died already?"
Looking at her face makes me feel guilty for something I didn't do.
Your cat is older than me and looks a lot younger. I envy her.
Professor McGonagall?
Omg she looks so grumpy it's so cuuute ❤️ my cat also has a resting grumpy face 😂 is your cat by any chance a Siberian? Mine is too and they look alot alike!
Beautiful beast!
That stern expression reminds me of Professor McGonagall :D
Looks much younger
Doubt.
U/archer93 you shall never beat me out of top awarder this is a threat
She's pretty
WOW ! THOSE ARE LIKE 90 HUMAN YEARS OLD !! SHE'S AN INCREDIBLE CAT !!!
She is so beautiful. Cats are such magnificent creatures and it’s so fortunate yours has lived for so long! And she still has a youthfulness about her. My cat is 10 but I can’t bare to part with her. Cats are more than pets, they’re soulmates. It took me two hours to say goodbye to my cat before going on a trip, I can’t imagine ever being without her for long. She’s my everything, as cats are my everything too. Ooft I’ve just rambled on about cats again lmao.
I love her!!
Stunning gal!
An actual Queen 😍

She looks so young!! Bless her with many more years and good health! 💛
She's beautiful. I'm so happy she's been with you this long
What a good, good friend.
Still beautiful after 22 years! ❤️❤️❤️
When 22 years old you reach, look as pretty you will not, hmm?
I had a kitty who looked just like yours and she lived to be 23! I had her from 8th grade through college, boyfriends, marriage, baby and moving from California to Washington state to Oregon.

It's pretty wild and wonderful to have a furry friend who shares so much history with you.
I’m 21, she’s older than me!
Hope she keeps on going :)
Hope she stays happy and healthy for many years to come! 💘
She seen more than me o;
What's her secret?
Looks like she disapproves of some of the choices you’ve made along the way.
Lucky
Your cat almost looks like my cat he is 1 years old, what a cutie.
Wow she looks really good, I’d never guess her age
She looks like a no nonsense secretary. I will eat your soul...with adoableness
Chest floof to die for
She will never leave you. It's her promise to you.
I love her and I want to kiss her
She looks so healthy despite her age!  Great job!
OP, you should post this to /r/seniorkitties
This cat is wise and ancient to degrees unknown in the feline realm. You must record her thoughts and opinions so that future cats may benefit from the wisdom of their ancestors
You live with a Regal Queen.
That is one damn good cat.
"Do not speak to me about the scrolls, child; I was there when they were written"
Master of the RBF
Doesn’t look like she’s *feline*!*t...
what food brand do you feed? Do you take her to get teeth cleanings often and do u give her any supplements?
❤️😻
She’s over 100!
M a j e s t i c
She’s beautiful!
Little old lady cats with grumpy faces are the Best!
What's the secret to a long life for cats?
Carefully she might get to dance on your grave if it keeps up like this
Long may you fur...
Ownnn precious!
Wow, **that** long?! I'm impressed!
Somehow got the royal expression of a lioness :)
Is that Dame Judi Dench?
Damn she looks so fierce!
So very noble
She looks so majestic
What a cute grump
And she’s been angry for most of it lol
And she looks like "I'm just getting started". You are an amazing guardian human, keep doing what you're doing.
Fucking amazing
Any tips? She’s beautiful!
What a beautiful floof.

I personally love the little grump face.
Oh she looks like a wonderful companion. I had my cat for 11 years and he recently went missing. :’( I’m trying to cope being without him it’s been hard
Both of my cats died at 8 years old :( 

Im jealous of people that have cats that live so long
i miss my cat.. :(
"You're taking pictures of me for the internet again, aren't you?"
Only 90's cats will get this
That's awesome. I don't know a lot about cats, but 22 is old, right? I wish dogs lived this long too. Very happy for you.
Wow. She is so strong!
I hope my kitty lives for 22 years :((
If i remember right, its either 28 or only 8 more and she becomes a nekomata.
Doesn't seem too happy about it
She's so beautiful!
She looks majestic!😍
so soff
Ah that's a face of wisdom. Good cat
I loooooove her
Cute!
So full of judgement!
She looks like a straight bitch. I love it.
cats look more grumpy when the age
She looks like a bitter old woman
Just lost our boy Max he was 16 miss him so much
She's fairly fed up with your shit though!
She looks like she’s judging you...
Your cat is older than me. Damm.
She looks determined to deal with your shit forever
That's amazing! My wife and I had three cats. Sadly my youngest cat which I considered to be my actual cat passed away last year due to liver failure. She was the greatest cat I've ever known. When I first met her at the SPCA she literally crawled up my shoulders and laid across my shoulders on the left and right side, back feet hanging off my left shoulder and her head hanging off my right just laying there. I'd never seen a cat do that and knew she had to go home with me. When I would go from one end of the house I would play with her and go back and forth through the house as she chased me playfully. She was the best cat I'll ever meet and miss her so much. Rest in peace my sweet little girl Lilly. Daddy misses you. She was only 8 years old
In village where i live, there is a cat older than me
I lost my 20 year old cat two weeks ago to oral cancer, she looked like a short haired version of your cat. Hug your pets, it hurts like hell once you can't anymore.
She is beautiful!
BREAKING NEWS

Cat literally too angry to die.
She still looks like a kitten!
She looks like one of those grandmothers who is so stubborn that she makes it her mission to outlive her own children
Runs on pure spite, and love. Because, cats.❤️🐱
Your cat looks like a creature that has been and will be here forever. It looks gandalf wise.
She looks viciously cute
She looks like an older version of my kitty, mine even does that pouty face sometimes too!
That's not a kitten? Could've fooled me!
Enjoy every bit of time you have left with her, she looks great for that age in a cat! Looks so noble.
Someone is beautiful and sick of your shit lol
She doesn’t look very pleased about it. Hahaha jk. What an adorable creature ❤️❤️
Her face says she REFUSES to die
Majestic
She is utterly beautiful, I wish you many more decades.
I just lost my 19 year old a few months back. Treasure the time man, it was and still is super rough.
Your cat looks exactly like mine. So beautiful
She’s an animagus.
Looks like a really good painting of a regal cat
Bro, what did you do? She looks pissed.
Did anyone tell you that she looks like the cat from the pet cemetery?
Meow
Doesn’t look 22. Hope many more years to follow!
That look says it all, your cat will outlive you.
That’s the healthiest 20+ cat I’ve sever seen. What’s the secret? Mine are only 5 but I’m hoping they’ll be with me for a long time.
Wow. She looks great for 22.

“My rage fuels my need to live” 
-That cat probably
She is beautiful! 🐱
She’s magnificent
My cat is 16, he is getting a little grumpy.

My cat from the future
Campire

MY AUNT HAS A CAT THAT IS EXCACTLY THE SAME AGE AND LOOKS EXCACTLY THE SAME WTF AND STILL ALIVE AND DEAF

Holy crap! So she was born in the 90s???
When they get to their mid teens they're like fully grown woman lol. I love my katty nollie. Lol, except they actually love you. Hahaha
She looks so good! What kind of cat is she?
Wow that’s amazing! I’ve had a wonderful cat that I think believed she was human, and although she was a strong breed she developed a chronicle infection that killed her before the age of 10... Still miss her every day 😢
She is magnificent 🥰
The most evil things usually live the longest. Nah shes probably just using her RBF or something
22 year of judging you.

What a nice cat she is
I think I have your cats doppelganger. Just not as fluffy, similar age too.
She looks really young and majestic
Seems like cats and Asian men age in the same way.
She still looks young while my 11 year old has old man face
I lost my cat of 24 years last year. It was only the last few weeks she was with us That you could even tell she was old. I was only 3 years older than her
22 years! This cat is 4 years older than me, it must be super wise. Hope she lives a healthy life!
You love to see it
The character in that face. She’s earned a celebratory oil painting I think.
She looks like such a boss...
Her pure rage keeps her going.


Im sorry but your cat is SO TOTALLY ADORABLE!
She looks like she’s seriously judging something but she’s very cute!
Holy shit that cats my age
If you don't mind  , can you share her food plan ? 

i want to make sure i am giving proper food to my persian cat also !
You can't get rid of me bitch!!! I'm not going no where!!!
She's not angry, OP, just disappointed....
dude have u watched pet cemetary?
Dat wisdom is her eyes !
She looks amazingly fluffy. After 15 most cats start to really show their age.
The council is not amused.
Very pretty kitty
What do you feed her. Just wondering what elixir has kept her looking so good?
The rage fuels her and keeps her sustained
What a beauty!!! Looks like she doesn’t take shit from anyone, must be her secret.
Regal.
She's the cutest grumpybum I've ever seen!

My now husband had to say goodbye to his shorthair 18 y/o pitch black boy a few years ago, broke our hearts to have to say goodbye. I'm so happy your baby is still going strong, give her all the gentlest head pats, ear scritches or where ever is her favourite scritchies spot from us, shes so beautiful 😍
Good kitty! ♥️
Enjoy every moment with her!
She’s seen some shit.
What an absolutely gorgeous floof! Give her a snuggle and a boop from me!!
She looks like a kitten...I thought I was gonna read 22 days. She's lovely!
this pleases me.
And still pissed about something by the looks of her
Omg she as old as me 😭😭
Holy shit, I have his/her twin!!


Nala https://imgur.com/gallery/Kce8iBL
Cute cat❤
She looks so wise.

Angry.  And a little judgy... but maybe that’s part of being wise.  She’s beautiful.
That sweet angry face!!!!
Wow that cat has been around since I was 3 year old  for some reason that is crazy to me
Nice cat!
She looks like Winston Churchill.
Whats her secret?
I had to put down mine of 10 years yesterday, hug yours for me.
she looks 10 years younger, well done, you've really done a good job!
Lost my best bud of 19 years yesterday :( she looked so young and healthy until a couple weeks ago she just started eating away and never stopped...
never seen such a gorgeous cat at this age
She looks like if you did her wrong then she'd go strong on you
My girls 20 and still going strong gotta love the senior kitties. I hate to think of the day I have to say good bye to her but I’ve honestly already put thought into adopting an older shelter cat when the time comes. They don’t get enough love and are often the sweetest souls.
Your baby girl looks pissed haha
Way to go! In my life we had a red tabby who lived to 26♥️🐾
Older than me
With that expression, I wouldn't be surprised if she outlives you!
My cats 18
I just adopted basically this exact breed of cat and she is 14 years old. Looks like I have a good amount of years ahead with her :)
22 she doesnt look like she even is close to be 22
I had a 23 year old black kitty from when I was 4 that lived until I was 27, moved out, married and had kids of my own.  I've got a great 12 year old Spice now, but that 23 year old kitty (similar to yours) is easily the best kitty buddy I've ever had. Pouring one out for you Samantha
Very healthy looking cat.
She doesn't look a day over 2!
This is the look of "I have been with my owner 22 years now and, unfortunately, she is still going strong."
she looks 8...
BREAKING NEWS: Kitty literally too angry to die!
She’s a stone cold bitch and I love her.
You lucky ducky !
She is so majestically grumpy. I love her.
Beautiful floof.
She looks too judgemental to pass on. Even if she does, her ghost will just stay on the same shelf, looking down on all other cats.
She's looking fed up with your shit, Natalie.
She's so beautiful! That's awesome.
That's a very beautiful pussycat, long may she continue.
r/supermodelcats
What an absolutely beautiful little baby
Old cat.
She still grumpy tho
And still full of sass!
Pray for the legend
Wow she's older than me! Keep on hanging bud
Soooooooon
What do you feed her?
She’s been fed up with your shit for 21 of those years lol
I love her expression.
Based on the shade she’s throwing, she hasn’t let her standards drop in her old age.
I’m waiting for her to tell me to get off her lawn.
Our oldest cat is 18 years old and has that same resting bitch face.
Pet Sematary patron?
It's the hatred 🤣
What a purrincess!
That cat have seen it all..  


just the wise Cat sitting and waiting for you to solve the riddles for crunchies
She looks pissed
There are famous people younger than your cat
I think I love her.
Someday I will have my best friend and I will love him so much
Cats are so cute
doesn't look a day over 12. What a sweet heart.
It’s gonna sounds bizarre, but this is why I didn’t get a cat haha. I was like damn can I commit to 2 decades of life? No. I cannot. Can hardly take care of myself
nice
Absolute smokeshow.
I love seeing these older kitties! I have a 7yr old and a 2yr old. I hope they pull a long haul too!
Based on that face she's going to outlive you out of spite.
This cat is definitely over someone's shit.
blessings, i hope i have my girl for that long
Grumpy and gorgeous.
awwww
The most beautiful lady who has had enough of your shit.
Wow omg
She seems angry at Covid 19 haha
My 6 year old floofer girl just gave me the sweetest snuggles this morning and seeing posts about 22 year old floofer girls gives me all the hope that mine will live to that beautiful old age too.

Your girl is stunning. Tell her I love her and give her a smooch for me please!
She still looks like a kitten!
I love her face lol
She's definitely up to something. Expression's a dead give away.
She is beautiful!
10/10 fluff
wow she's beautiful
What a beauty
I had cat over 18 years before my baby passed. Loved her more than my own family. Your little munchkin looks so sweet.
And with that face of contempt will probably outlive you out of spite.
She still isn't taking any of your shit it seems.
That cat is the same age as me. I might get a cat if they live this long
She looks very serious lol. But so cute
Good for you! We had to put our cat down last week because of old age and fora sec I thought that photo was her
What kind of breed is this?
A queen! She looks like a long haired version of my girl (and she’s only 8!!)
Beautiful fluffy girl 🤩.
Wow what a gorgeous lady.
Lol she’s lived longer than my unvaccinated children
This makes me so happy
She looks fantastic! What a beautiful girl!
What a gorgeous kitty
Look at her "Professor McGonagall" look. What's her name?
looking good for 22.
Such a stern stare. The Karen of cats, meowhaps?
Incredible
That gaze is intense.
This isn't surprising. Pets taken good care of last a long time in captivity. Their natural life span is 15 years.

Reptiles prove this time and time again, far exceeding their expected life span in captivity
Strong Love! She looks good!
A beauty that’s for sure 😻
What a purrrrrty cat!
Majestic as fuck
She doesn't look a day over 10.
My girls 18 and we're having a bit of a health scare, she was really sick and stopped eating and drinking since Friday. We took her to the vet Monday and then Tuesday she's started eating and drinking again, so here's hoping!
Wow.   Let's find out what's in her genes.   She still looks middle aged.
She looks thrilled about it
she looks like she's getting real tired of your shit after 22 years tho.... xD My mothers cat got to 26 years. i hope yours still has lots of years with you!
I wish dogs lived as long as cats..
The floof is strong with this one.
She looks 14 at best.
You misspelled "12."

Seriously, though - she looks *great* for 22 years old! Enjoy every moment\~
Wow, she does NOT look happy.
Does she walk in normal speed or SLOMO. My friend had a cat this old and she was so delicate and deliberate when she walked.
She don't look a day over 10, such a beauty💗
Dog years? 22 wow - honestly did not know cats get that old
Any secrets for cat longevity you could share?
Such a gorgeous kitty!
The tail-around-the-feet curl. A classy lady.
Doesn't look a day older than twelve 😸
Whoa what do u feed her?? She’s precious
r/supermodelcats would love her!
She has yet to accomplish her final task of killing you
Cats, dogs and most parakeets (such as budgies) can live 15-20 years healthily. But most are cut short due to bad diets, shrinking average lifespan down to 7-10 years. Same reason why guinea pigs typically live 5 years when they can easily live 10.
let’s go for 44!
Wow, any advice on how to care for ones friend so they live happily for a long time?
"Aw jeeze... *another* pitchure? How 'bout dis, less with the 'snappity-snappy' more withe num-nums and chin rubs... how bout *dat?"*
She looks so fit and healthy, glossy fur and all
Beautiful girl 😻
I hope my cat lives this loooong!!! 🥰 long live little girl.
The purrrfect little grumpus
I got a baby cat from my friend because it was about my best friends time, he was a pitbull/boxer, and I knew I was going to have a hard time and same for my step dad, so we got her but after my dog Thor passed, we discovered little Pixel had leukemia and she wasnt even 6 months old. We had to put her down but now I hopefully want to rescue a cat and let him or her live the rest of their days happy and with a good family
Had to put down my second old cat earlier this year at 18 due to kidneys failing. Last old cat was 20 and just could not get around. Congrats on keeping her healthy this long. Still looking for another stray.
The Sophia Loren of cats she doesnt look her age!
That's a wonderful cat ❤️
That cat has a side quest
You don't look a day over 5!
She's beautiful
For 22yrs she looks to be in really good shape!
That cat's older than me!
She looks like she got a quest for us
She looks so healthy ❤️
She looks so sweet and feisty. This kitty is ALWAYS going to get her way, no matter what!
Looks to be in good shape
She’s living out of spite.
I'd watch your back if I were you....
So amazing. You are blessed. She looks good
Not gonna lie. ..she looks like she had enough lol
Genuinely curious, indoor cat or outdoor cat?

(This can include previous younger years as well)
Cool kat
Omg she’s the same age as me
Oh she's pretty pretty 😍!!
Bff
Love this!! I laughed out loud and showed your picture to my husband, because the look of disdain is exactly like one of our cats.
Woah such a beautiful cat! What breed is it? I'd love to get one like that in the future
Maine coons age so well
Amazing, hello beautiful girl💜
22 years and your cat looks like 10 at most. Beautiful kitty!
How do you make a cat live really long? I want my cat to live for 40+ years
I hope my boys live this long!
fuck that bitch ass cat
"Did you just call me old?!"
Is she a Siberian?
She looks like she's over your bs
So beautiful and healthy looking!
Beautiful Kitty.. especially for 22
Wow she looks amazing for 22!
She’s beautiful!
That is a fluffy little kitty who has seen some shit.
She looks determined to stay alive holy shit, that face
She's the best!  Respect the regal floof!
My childhood cat is 19. I want her to make it to 20. I hope she does. She's never had to go to the vet in her life, she's pretty spry. Your 22 year old is pretty. We're lucky to have our buddies for so long.
I pray for Good health of kitty.
Its those blood transfusions from kittens keeping her going. Same as the transfusions Queen Elizabeth gets from new born babies

(Thats a joke... i dont think queen Elizabeth gets blood transfusions, the cat on the other hand)

EDIT: the queen can actually still pull off that intimidating stare the cat is doing too.
She is a queen !
She's seen some shit
r/ntbdbiwdfta
r/ntbdbiwdfta
Gorgeous green eyes!!
She has that "i am gonna see you all die" look
So lucky! She looks great! I had a fluffy cat like that once. Didnt make it near as long:(
She's such a little darling! Super cute no matter what age she is, but amazing for 22.
What a sweet princess!
I wish my cat will live as long as yours! But she's fat ☹️ i have hard time trying to make her lose some weight, any advise guys?
You are clearly taking very *good* care of her!  She looks great!  Congratulations to both of you!
😲 Awww, what's their name?? 😀 And what is the secret to a long and happy kitty life?? 😆
Ol grumpus wumpus
she's beautiful!
and still she's majestic AF. beautiful girl!
That look of determination means she plans to outlive you
She's a granny I love her
Wow. I woke up this morning and saw this picture.  Today me and my sister have to go put down our kitty with a failing liver. She's about 18, but looks just about identical to this cat. For a split second I thought it was my sister who posted this.
Thank you for this.
Looks like she will outlive you. She will make sure of it... Awesome picture!
What kind of anti aging cream does she use?
she's older than me, wow
“My human has been with me for 22 years and appears to still be going strong.”
Active spite is a good sign, shes got some years left in her!! 😋
That chest is so floofy!!! Ready for pets
THE FUR LOOKS SO SOFT
Lookin good!!
This cat is older then me. May she live another 22 years. Cheers m8
She looks how I feel.
Very pretty and looking really good for 22.
I believe my cat Chi Chi died around 25 years old.
Majestic.
She still looks like a kitten!
Kitty
She is beautiful! :)
One for r/1or13
Really?
Beautiful queen!
She looks stubborn, she’ll be around forever!
Still angry!!
very fluffy
What do you feed your cat and what’s your cat routine?
she is so pretty ♥

After reading comments and post I compiled photos of my maine coon Esme. She is over 2y old, I adopted her early june. It's amazing for cat to live to 20 :O I would be so happy if she acoompanied me for so long, yet at the same time it means she would outlive my rough collie Vivi, she is 2,5 y old.

You can find photos of curious Esme here on imgur [https://imgur.com/a/662Fu9J](https://imgur.com/a/662Fu9J)

She looks angry often, but she also makes funny faces when sleeping. For some reason she puts her head upside down when sleeping and her favorite sleeping place is bathtub. She doesn't even mind water, often claiming tub when I want to go take shower and then she won't let me in :D she is very cute :O
What a beautiful kitty. She looks perfect for snuggles!
I feel she’s judging....something.  lol
Omg the bestttttt. You just made my morning ❣️
What a good looking girl! I thought she was easily half that to be honest.. You did wonderful in taking good care of her! 😁👍
She is beautiful and reminds me of my mom's cat. Nala was her name and she was afraid of me for 10 years, hiding in the bedroom under the bed whenever I came around. That was strange because I never gave her a reason to fear me. I love animals and am a very nice person. Then one day in her very old age, she wasn't afraid anymore and instead became very affectionate with me, sitting on my lap whenever I visited my mom. She was like that for her last couple of years until she passed away.
So reddit is full of cats that live happily past 20.

I didn't know.
Aww, she's purrfect
I had a cat for 3 months. He left for a Girl.....
Any secrets to success?
"it's been 22 years and you continue to disappoint me, janice."

-cat.
That's Professor McGonagall
That literally the wise old cat that would appear last second in the final fight right before the cat heroe was about to loose. And she would finesse the hell outta the bad cat with elegance and ease
Very beautiful
What is you secret! She looks great!!
Beautiful. I miss my cat. :(
This just in "Local Cat declared too angry to die."
She looks wise. Beautiful friend.
Nice! My old cat lived too 25! Next one I got will be 15 this October! Wish you many more happy fur baby years!
She's a cutie
my cat is about 1 and 1/2 and looks like this!! so precious! Did you do anything specific for your baby to lengthen her lifespan? (new cat owner here)
What beautiful fur for a 22 year old!! Congrats I’m so happy for you!
She is one gorgeous kitty!! Lost [my baby](https://i.imgur.com/dIqFfBl.jpg) about 3 years ago. She almost made it to 19 years young! Lost her to pneumonia but I and the vet tried to get her back on her feet. Was a wonderful time with her and I miss her every day. It goes by so fast when you think back on it. Now I get to deal with [this little feller](https://i.imgur.com/ZfePKxX.jpg) who is 4 months old and a ham!
Majestic lady.

My old boy made it to 19 with me,  give her a kiss if she will permit it.
An absolute beauty
"22 years I have let this humon live in my house." 

- Cat probably
That is a face that has seen what you have to offer and has found you wanting.
Oh yeah!!! My girl lived to 23. She was in pretty rough shape in the end but your looks great!!
Going strong and going evil hahaha
22 years of getting woken up from a nap condensed into a single picture.
wow she looks so youthful! What do you feed her?
Seems like she might be one of [my cat's](https://imgur.com/a/RQxd9BL) relative !
I'm a cat lover and proud father of 3 Black cats and I have to say that your cat is absolutely beautiful.
such a cutie!!
Maine coons all seem to age well and have that air of superiority
And sick of your shit for the last 20....
She’s purrfect!
She’s such a pretty girl.....uhem, lady.........umm, old lady 😂
Cute! We had the exact same cat, those cats are fighters and live long, we had to put her down when she was 19 years old... I remember when she was 5, she fell from the balcony, 3rd story and she was just fine 😄
That face says "22 years of your dog damned bullshit."
I have 3 cats and could say this is the 4th cutest kitty ever
She’s older than most Fortnite players
That cat looks like a viking
Respect her life, respect your love.
My cats 20 now and looks almost identical outside of the fur pattern.
I'd never think that there'd be a cat that is the same age as me.
What an absolute Queen
Long live the Queen!
That's the face of putting up with 22 years of op's bull$#+:.
Legend
Gorgeous
She so cute
Absolutely beautiful. You must have some great memories with her. I hope my cats live that long. ❤️
She’s seen some things
I like how all old cats got a grumpy look like they're so done with the shit their human slaves do.
Woof! That look is just something else.  Love it
This is another of those amazing posts where I make the sound that this sub is named after. Proper aww material right there.
Resting cat face
what a queem
I love older cats that look like they’re clinging to life out of pure spite and hatred for everything else in the world
r/ntbdbiwdfta
This makes me so happy and so sad at the same time.

I just lost my kitty yesterday after 18 years with her. 
Cherish every moment. ❤️
My my! I can see wisdom in her eyes, experience in her fur and royalty in her posture ❤️

God bless her
Can you make my dog be with me for 22 years? I love this.
Just looking at her you can tell how soft she is.
Your pretty kitty is the same age as me! Wishing her more years to come x
Hi, what do you give her to eat ?
22 years. Wow. She's aged gracefully.
"I will out live you all"
She is beautiful!
McGonagall is that you
She’s super cute (but *angery*)
I see that she's grumpy like a regular senior.
I had a fur ball that made it to 20 years before she got cancer and I had to put her down. Still miss her and she’s been gone 6 years now. 😥
She's looking like father,who is watching on his 14 years old daughter.
(Her name) - The noble cat

Has to be a movie!
Are the only thing keeping her alive cuddles and hate?
Amazing.
Amazing! What do you feed her?
She looks like the Judy Dench of cats
Beautiful. I lost my kitty when she was 22.
I think cats that live long lives are definitely inter dimensional beings.
She also appears to be scowling
You know what that is??? That’s all the human who takes care of her.  Good job! She looks happy.
She might be related to grumpy cat
120 year old human age pet.
what is her name?
This cat looks exactly like the last dude I was with.
Awww a regal grump! ❤️ She looks wonderful!
Beautiful
wow
I hope you didn't just jinx it. 

"Update: Nevermind"
Now going to wait 22 more years and see how she is doing!

RemindMe! 22 years
Her fur is in very good shape. She looks happy
Looks like she’s preparing to protect Winterfell
My cat is 14 and posts like these give me the hope he’s gonna stay with me for many more years. You kitty is beautiful! I hope I can make a post like this in another 8 years ❤️
That is impressive
Hope it doesn't sound too weird but your cat makes me think of Halle Barry. Aging like a fine wine, I bet your cat looks more fierce and beautiful now than she did 10-15 years ago.
She looks like she’s playing the long game
Imagine he dies the next day
Did she go vegan or what!?😂
You did a wonderful job of taking care of her!
Norwegian wood Cat? Or derived from this breed?

They are the best. A friend of my had one who was at least 22 as well. He started his life as a streetcat so could be easily beyond that.
My cat is 25 years old this year and is still going strong. No signs of slow down at all.
She's here to stay like the Queen of England
And she is entirely sick of your shit.
Do you mean her eyes?
My oldest cat lived till 23 but the last few years she just slept, woke up and meowed at me when i pet her, ate tunafish, and had nasty poops. But man was she such an alive cat for 20 years. Mighty rabbit hunter (who once almost got stomped by our horses for coming in with a rabbit, they scared her and the rabbit got away), loving cuddle bug, and ferocious player with our other cats. 

Enjoy all the time and you get!
She looks like my baby who is four. I hope she is with us as long as yours!
I read this as, ‘She’s been with me for 22 years and still disapproves.’ .
So beautiful! 😍
What breed or cat is she? Also does she shed a lot?
Beautiful!
She makes me miss my grumpy old lady that just died this year.  She was 18 years old and died from kidney disease.

Your baby is super cute!
She has a beautiful coat for 22, she’s so cute!
Bro thats a furry
Looks like a wizard
Wow cute babooshka
Too angry to die.
So pretty! But so angry. why so angry?
Majestic!
She A N G E R Y
That is a good looking cat for that age. Truly “The Betty White ofCats”,
This cat is a year older than me. That’s amazing. Here’s to hoping I’ll get to be with my cats for a very long time (they are both turning 5 soon)
She looks like she’s been tired of everybody’s shit for the last 21 of those 22 years.
Not sure if this'll ever reach you, but I really want a closeup on her eyes!!
She looks very wise.
Still a kitten
120 awards??? Wtf?
Omg and so beautiful! Hope you are able to continue enjoying her company for many years to come!
You are one lucky individual.  Cherish each other! :)
Crazy to think this cat is older than me.. I am 19 years old. 
This cat is so damn beautiful
Looking better than myself at 25
Damn your cat is the same age as me and I don't look nearly as good as she does.
I love her.
She’s beautiful...so fluffy and healthy!
What a beauty! She looks like Captain Janeway too.
!remind-me 1 year
So beautiful
Having a pet for that long is a blessing
Beautiful Cat!
huh, so I actually can't not upvote this post. . . interesting.
The cat is older than me 😳
My baby lived to be 25. Enjoy every minute!
YAY! My girl will be 20 on Monday!
She's not interested in you anymore, bro. Move on.
She's so beautiful and not even close to looking her age. She looks almost just out of being a kitten to adult phase
Looks too stubborn to die
Such a majestic Aura.
It feels kinda odd that I'm younger than this kitty lol
22 years are you sure she's not a Flerken
So beautiful! Mine just turned 18 and I’m thankful for every day with her!
Beautiful. May she remain with you as long as possible!
My gosh! What a lovely beast :D
You can see wisdom in her eyes.
You are wise and powerful.
She’s gorgeous. Like a wise owl.
She looks determined to outlive you.
You only see the age in her eyes! What a beautiful kit cat!
She’s so cute. She looks like a baby still.
She looks pissed af that shes still alive..
She still looks super healthy too, congratulations on having such a cool cat! 

What does her diet consist of?

I want to switch our kitties over to whatever secret diet you've unlocked. Ha!
Great to have a pet around this long! Give her a pet for us!
That's one strong-willed kitty!
She has mastered that scowl
Your cat is so cute that i acidentally keep petting my monitor
What a beautiful cat!

How often did you visit the vet when she was ages 10-20?
The power The pose The.... elegance
Pet Cemetery vibes anyone?
22 years of *"sorry guys my cat is sitting on my mousemat"*
Oh maaaannn such a smoochable forehead

Wanna moosh that mad face
Looks grumpy
Literally the most beautiful cat ever!
My cat was with me 18 years. I sometimes wonder if she lived as long as she did because she walked around with a permanent resting bitch face and the personality to match it. Boy do I miss her!
I love cute little old ladies, especially when they’re cats.
Maximum floof!
What a noble creature
Her power resides in her chest floof
Thats one fuckin nice kitty right there
Wow, she looks really good for 22.
Live long and prosper.
Her expression is intriguing.I perceive something like "I'm gonna bury you and dance over your tomb Karen"
she’s beautiful! what do you feed her?
Most beautiful graceful animals. 22, shes an old gal but looks healthy. Hope you have many more years of companionship.
"Dinkleberg.......*rubs nipples*"
