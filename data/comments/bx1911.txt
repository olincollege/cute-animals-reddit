That guys dad game is strong.
I couldn’t get over how white this dude’s teeth are. Nice chompers man.
This child is adorable, and dad is killin it.  Time to go hug my kids.
I'm 29 and I want this guy to babysit me
That is a great way to encourage speech development
I love everything about this!
This is insanely adorable! Hand motions and tone perfect with the baby, too funny
Lmao the baby is literally going with it.


You know what im sayin?


baby is nodding, yea I do know what youre sayin
This exercise will help him develop language skills very early.

And he won't shut up.
I do the same thing with my nephew. I always pretend he is complaining about his mom and dad.
The kid is going to be a really good conversationalist. Eventhough he dont understand what some words his dad is talking about, he still able to continue the conversation so seamlessly.
I am so stressed around babies lol that guy is str8 chillin
This is a great way to bond and build trust with others. Baby will be a great conversationalist when older.
I love seeing examples of loving fathers. We need more of these!
Stop. This is to cute. He is so smart already and has picked up on so much in his environment with the hand gestures and interactions. He’s giving dad advice.
Somebody get me pregnant
holy heck my ovaries
Looking forward to my first kid soon... Seeing this video fills me with *determination*.

Take your time, little buddy, but I can't wait to meet you.
I love the little nod they give after some lines. Like they just said something deep as fuck.
r/MadeMeSmile material right here
You my friend... Are an awesome dad!
This is funny and cute at the same time
I do this with my animals, now that my kids are older, they mostly just argue. 

This got my heart good.
I did this with my son too lol.  It looks crazy and cute but it's great bonding.  My son is 3 now and wont shut up, just talks and talks.  As a first time parent its amazing to see how quick their vocabulary expands if you talk them.

I just imagined his side of it like Bruce Willis from look who's talking
I love the hand gestures. 😂😂
Kids first words gonna be "know what im sayin" ?
I love the shmoopy picture of the mom and dad low on the wall behind them. Between that much love and speaking to this kid in full sentences, he will do fine.
Say hi to Ellen for us.
This is great! 

I'll be delivering our son, our first child, via c-section tomorrow. I can only hope that he and his dad can have the same kind of rapport!

Edit: thank you guys, and gals, for all your kind words, advice (which is very helpful), and well-wishes! We're very excited to meet our little man! 

My OB has been in the game for about 30 years and tells me that he feels the 11.7lb estimate we were given last week on baby's weight is "likely pretty accurate", though the standard is of course, +/-2lb. When I asked about fundal height, he told me, "I'll put it to you this way: if that were twins, they'd be big." I went to the hospital today to have my pre-op bloodwork done and every single one of the phlebotomists and nurses said, "are you having twins?" I'm 38+6 and completely miserable, but also very relieved about the end being very much in sight. My bag is all packed and I'm going to add my pillow to it in the morning (it's a throw pillow off my best friend's couch in our old apartment that is the PERFECT bump-buffer size) for the ride home.
Damn, those genes though. 

Cute daddy, cuter baby.
Dad is so smooth with his responses. Also, the way the baby looks at dad while he’s talking is amazing.
[deleted]
This is why I always try and avoid talking to kids in a baby voice. They are smarter than you think. 
Still r/kindsarefuckingstupid but still...
This is adorable.

That man sounds very similar to Donald Glover.
I wish I had my dad, he passed away when i was only 3 years old. I dont even have any memories of him but I so how miss him. 

I want to be the best of me for my future kids.
So cute!
It’s so cute it’s making me angry
This kid is so loved. It makes my heart happy.
That was adorable! I have a family member who at about one year old had conversations like that all the time. She is genius level smart now. Full scholarship to a really great school. STEM major. Keep talking to your babies.
Fucking 10/10 dad. 86436775/10 baby.
Don’t tell my wife but this makes me want another kid.
This is basically me during 95% of conversations with people in loud places.
This is totally wonderful (and dad should be a model!).
OMG this was my boy when he was that age.  He wouldn't say much most of time but when I put him in his car seat and it was just us two, he would babble non stop.  I never understood hardly a word but would just carry on like I was having a normal conversation.  Once in a while I'd catch him looking at me with his head tilted like "WTF dad, that's not what I'm talking about" and I knew I had just got busted.
Dad here. My son did something similar when he was this age. I was carrying him and he was babbling baby-talk like this video and grabbing my face. Finally, I looked at him and asked, "what's up, buddy?". When he knew he had my attention, he babbled more, paused, and then laughed loud. He did this several times and I realized that he was telling me JOKES like he had seen me do tons of times. 


It didn't last as long as this great video, but I'd give anything for a video of him telling me jokes before he could even speak.
Adorable and funny  , brilliant combo
This baby is so *goddamn* meta and I fucking love it.
The part where the _baby_ nods and agrees with the dad, I lost it.
At 0:50 the baby is like 
I don't have words to explain but I am trying Dave I am trying real hard.

Now tell me what does Marcellus Wallace look like
My ovaries. They've detonated.
That baby’s gotta feel so fucking empowered right now.
The more you speak and read to your children, the better their speech and language skills will be. Start as soon as you can and never stop.
Thank you
Gotta be one of the cutest videos ever.
It's strange but one of my earliest memories is me in the park with my dad and my dad replying to something I said and me thinking


>That's weird people don't usually understand when I speak 

Now I'm kind of wondering if he was just doing this
The joy in the Dads face is priceless
The best part was at 0:57 when they both nod in agreement.
Have fun on Ellen!!
I love the hand gestures! My kiddo’s former speech therapist told us she could tell when parents engaged with their kids like this- just by the hand gestures.
Thank God this video wasn’t 4 hours long because I would have sat here at work and watched EVERY damn minute of this adorable conversation.
I never wanted to have kids... But seeing my husband interact with kids has made me change my mind in the last 6 months. This daddy and his baby remind me of the warm feeling I get in my heart
“Ahgahfgah” 

“EXACTLY what I was thinkin’!”

my heart has melted
Elsewhere on baby reddit, babies are laughing over the Dad's random gibberish while son carries on conversation with dad.
This is so fucking adorable
The smile on the Dad’s face is the absolute best! I think all Dads can relate.
holy fuck i caaaant take thiss arrrrghhhh
I'm not a kid person but this is so adorable..I can't stand it 💕 Dad being awesome & baby cute as can be. Great way to build conversation skills.
What an amazing dad. Not too long ago, I felt I knew I was going to be a great dad like this, because of how I treat and talk with my nephews and nieces. I pay attention and talk with them like this (not as good though), because I know talking and treating them like an equal will help them developmentally... Things didn't work out in my life, and now I'm just gonna have to stay an uncle for a bit longer. Thinking about it kinda makes me wanna cry
Such a great dad!
anyone else super curious what show they were watching?
This is really healthy for language development. Teaches the back-and-forth nature of conversation and improves listening skills.
Ellen will join this conversation next week.
That was like a scene from *Star Wars*.
That was really was too cute and great work Dad!!
That baby has a gigantic forehead. It's adorable
That baby’s like “holy shit, I’m doin’ it!”
He is copying his dad so much, he will be a spitting image of his old man in no time hahaha
*\*cries softly\** This dude is killing ok, fuckin killing that parenting game
This makes my ovaries ache.
My ovaries have disintegrated. This is SO CUTE
How old is this baby?
So fucking adorable. Could watch for hours literally.
Never baby talk and your baby will surprise you.  Very cute.
I want to have like 10,000 of this guys babies.
Baby's first words: "know what I'm sayin?"
This is hilarious and adorable!
I’m older than this guy, but I wish he was my dad.
Kid's first words are gonna be, "Know um sayin?"
Amazing! That baby is already better at chatting than me.
This is great, and super important for language development! It teaches the baby how conversation works and gives them positive feedback on their intonation and gestures. Plus it’s super cute.
The father is fine as hell I could barely pay attention to what the baby was saying
I have a feeling they are watching One Punch Man
Amazing. Absolutely amazing!!!
I love the way he's sitting up on the couch. So cute and adorable!
This is SO heartwarming.... my dad barely spoke to me my entire childhood. Nothing’s changed into my adulthood. Hope both dad and son appreciate each other and nurture their wonderful relationship!!!
I am pretty deaf and can't hear through my speakers, so I watched this. It totally looked like a real discussion. Just loved it!
This is the cutest thing ever.  I remember doing that with my kids when they were little, too.  It's so much fun.
at 1:13 that baby look "he doesnt get a single fucking thing that I am saying"
The kid made some good points.
Baby and Daddy are so cute!! Awh! Mom & Dad and others in the house clearly use their hands when talking, so he is mimicking not only the speaking but also the movement. Very interesting, cute and smart kid.
Go ahead baby, graduate HS at 12 and embarass us all.
I was having an absolutely terrible say.  I am now having a wonderful day.  This was too gosh darn cute
I could watch this all day 😁❤️
It's really fucked up that reddit allows people to post videos of kids being recorded without there consent
❤️🙌
First time commenting on this subreddit. 

Cutest fucking video I've seen on Reddit. Ever.
Take notes new dads. I used to do this just cause I thought it was funny, but I built an early, strong bond with my children because of it.  Today, their between 17 and 22 and we can still sit down and talk.
My daughter is having a baby in a couple of weeks. I hope to have this type of connection/conversation with the little boy some day.
Nice lol
This is too cute, you know what I’m sayin’?
I'm literally getting ready to hit the road for Disney, and I dont see myself smiling any harder this week
🤣 this guy is going to be a amazing father. I look forward to the replay of this when the kid is a teenager.
Oh, my ovaries!
Seeing great dads just makes my heart so warm. Every time I see a guy, especially younger guys, just show so much love for their children it just makes me so happy. There are so many stereotypes that men of this generation are bad fathers and seeing people break that stigma is just the best.
Baby's first words 'You know what I'm saying?'
This kills me. What a dad.
This is what happens when you just speak to your kids like adults
That 'yeah yeah' from the baby at 0:59 lmao

Adorable af
Maybe, and now hear me out, maybe he can just understand the babyspeech and we all think the baby is talking gibberish?!
Omg I needed this. Love!
Clearly that baby did not like how Season 8 went either.
That kids first words are gonna be "You know what I'm saying" and everyone will love it
This kid keeps up small talk better than I do and I’m a grown ass woman
/u/secretc12
u/SkyCuboid
This is like when I have conversations with my great aunt who has advanced Alzheimer’s.

My family says I’m toying with her, but I’m not. 

Suffered still want that human connection. It doesn’t have to make sense to you. I think they get mad because they don’t understand what we’re talking about, but neither do I. 

Don’t treat Alzheimer’s suffers like a potted plant. They’re still humans with human desires.
So I didn’t want kids but after this video my ovaries may have changed their mind.
This is so adorable. That baby and his hand movements, his little butt wiggle when he talks, face expressions. Omg too much. His did is adorable too and clearly very in love with his kiddo.
There is nothing more attractive than a man who’s good with kids good lord
What a good dad! Talking to your baby when they're babbling is so good for their development! He's gonna have a smart kid.
I do this EXACT same thing with my Cat.
Don't know what the dad was talking about, but the baby makes a lot of sense
I've seen people try to do this because it good for the baby to talk to them like normal to develop their speech, but it always seems super awkward. I think because they know why they're doing it and they are forcing themselves to come up with anything for the sake of talking. This dad right here is just laid back and making (not trying to make) a moment with his kid. Just showing how much he appreciates being with his kid and interacting with him. Just being there for him and encouraging him with other saying it. This guy is a great role model for his son.
The interactions and encouragement smiles beat ten years of communication between me and my dad, which is silence and sometimes judgement
I love this!!  The kid is getting a LOT out of this conversation.  I always talked to my son as if he was a peer, even as an infant, and he has a great vocabulary.  Good job, Dad!
This is the point where being a dad becomes truly rewarding, when your kid can communicate with you and develops a personality. Don't get me wrong, it's great before this too but up until this point it's like taking care of a baby. From this point on you're raising a kid and it's much more fun and engaging in my opinion. My son is 5 and we're about to have our second one.
Just sooo darn cute !!  What a good Dad !!
the comments are   
1. " I love everything about this! "  
2. "telling a story about their babies"
I’m literally just scrolling through paused and looking at their facial expression. Some great pictures in there.
This is how you talk to your 12 month old. They LOVE THIS SHIT. Only thing—they will follow you around forever like the paparazzi.
The baby totally understood him when he said "Huh?". Little man repeated the exact words he just said.
I call this, "When they start talking but their English hasn't come in yet."
This is hands down the cutest shit I have seen all year.
Dude bees know math. This baby gets it
*my heart*
u/transcriptionbot
Hahaha!  That is frisking adorable!!  It’s wonderful that the Dad just goes along with the baby’s gibberish!  So entertaining and enjoyable!

I agree with another comment that this helps develop the baby’s conversation skills.  Never speak baby talk to a baby - it’s not a real language!  They are capable of learning 2 languages but make them real ones!
I’d definitely watch a YouTube channel of them reacting to videos.
This what Dads do!
This is the best thing to do with your kids. You can't understand them but just keep talking to them without baby talk.
On a day with so much funk in my heart, this made me smile.
This cured my depression
This made my day.
Beautiful. GREAT DADDY!.
First words will be "you know'em sayin'?"
That’s amazing, that’s what I am saying.
"Did you understand it though?"
"...no."
I bet the dad talking to the kid like that actually helps language and cognitive development because he's learning how conversations work or something lol
This is the guy who makes you feel like you’re making total sense when the blunt has you and your brains melting into the couch.
"We think a lot alike." That is beyond cute 💗
Dad is happy, baby is happy, reminds me of me and my son.  So good
When you smoke too much weed as a parent 🤣🤣 so funny/cute
I don’t know who I love more here: the baby or the dad!
I do this same exact thing at work with parents and their babies. The toddlers absolutely adore it, the parents even love it more.
*[Everyone Liked That]*
Crabman?
I want this guy to be my dad
This is great hahAA!!
Omg cuteee all the baby’s body language too 😍
So cute!
u/vredditdownloader
Shit this kid is more eloquent than most people on this site
The kid is speaking the language of gods,props to dad for understanding it.
This is how a sims convo plays out
I wonder if he thinks his Dad can understand him and that was he is saying is actual words.
This reminds me of the video with the kitten trying to emulate its mom washing. Just as cute too.
Oh. My. Good. God! That is possibly the most adorable daddy/baby video I have ever seen! Even more adorable than my own husband/child! Omg.....so precious!
Please have another one of those conversations with each other!!! Absolutely heartwarming !!!! Thank you from so many of us .
I'm no father! And I don't think I'll have kids any sooner but this right here is wholesome and adorable af!
Hahaaa this is good stuff.
it's amazing to have a baby makes you everyday thinking that you did something amazing in your life.

having a baby it's not just girl's dream it's also what man wants when he meet the right womam
FATHERHOOD 100
Gonna do the same thing with my 1 year old son now.
I think this is the cutest video I’ve seen on reddit all month
Thank you for sharing this wonderful video I couldn’t stop smiling all the way through it you certainly are blessed
Precious.
I want to be that type of dad.
Look how much love there is in that man's eyes! This dude dad's hard
Just scrolled through top of all time. Happy cake day
This is so absolutely adorable! 💜
WHAATT?!!
Reddit doesn't get much better than this tbh
I hope one day I can be a father like that
Amazing parenting
Aw. This is precious. The child already grasps taking turns when speaking, and I bet will be learning words in no time!!! I bet they'll be laid-back and funny like their dad too!!! Love it!!
My ovaries just exploded
This baby's IQ must be off the charts for that age. They way he/ she is picking up on speech patterns and tones and the give n go of conversation is incredible
I don't want kids but fuck dude if this isn't the cutest goddamn thing I've ever seen in my life.



This may change my opinion on them
That was way too cool, glad you got it on video
This made my day
This is very heartwarming
Oh my goodnessssss. This is perfect.
Fantastic.
Oh my gosh I didn't want this to end.
I have a kid about the same age and I have to translate everything she says to other people.  It’s weird that I can halfway figure out what she’s saying and everyone else hears it as pure gibberish.
I am studying language acquisition in children right now and i think it's really remarkable (and adorable!) how they can adapt at such a young age and interact with people like that! so much going on in that little guy's brain right now 😁
So damn cute! i love how in to the conversation both of them are. I'm at work, i miss my little buddy now.
Too CUTE!
u/protomanEXE1995  I'm sorry, but this is adorable.
10/10 would give Oscar
Fucking shit doesn't play , I want to watch it badly
My ovariiieeeessss
My boyfriend sent me this saying he can’t wait for this day with our child 😭 my heart
Man, I know I don't want kids.... But my ovaries definitely do while watching this video 😍😍😍 this is so cute I can't even handle it.
God I am crying!!! I want to have a baby now 😍
That kid is adorable, my uterus is telling me I should make another one.
Love!!!
Example of a good dad
Welp, there goes my morning as I watch this on repeat.
So cute
❤
I could watch this for hours. So freaking adorable.
This is so goddamn fucking wholesome I love every second of this video.
This is one of the sweetest, cutest videos I have ever seen!
This is hilariously adorable!
This is absolutely adorable
So cute
Ahhh this is adorable.
Adorable child
My heart
That is adorable made me smile.
i think my tearducts activated and expelled a little bit of fluid.
Now, that's a dad!
That's awesome stimulation.

Props to that guy.
Hahaha that’s adorable
How sweet is this!
That is one animated kid! My baby just rolls around poops
I like to think they're watching Peppa Pig.
That right there is a prime example of a good father. That kid is going to benefit from conversations like that; it encourages communication development.
That baby has better social literacy than me. And I'm not even a baby.
That is just fantastic
Oh my word, that is SO adorable! Two fine young men having a totally involved conversation, and the hand gestures are the best!
Hits me right in the heart!
How sweet this is!! I love it!!
I love this too much
This dad is taking home all the awards. Lucky baby. Keep it up, dad!
THIS IS AMAZING IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY
That was amazing
This is probably the best video I have seen in a long time. Wish I can upvote it more than once
This guy is the master of having conversations when he can't hear what the other person is saying. I only wish I had that power
This is phenomenal. Great dadding, there.
Dad sounds like Donald Glover too lol so cute!!
 beautiful conversation and understanding
This is amazing
this is sooo cute :D
What a beautiful thing
Already using the hands! I lOVE IT!
Anytime I see an awesome dad (or mom!) I immediately respect everything about them. 

I’m a teacher and see kids that are constantly neglected / starving for attention. 

Parents who try their best and spend time talking with their kids freaking rock!
“I believe, I do know what you are saying.” - Baby
This made my day. I love it.
40 yo baby
That’s so Funny . Dad knows how to improvise!
his actual first words will be knowwhatimsayin
Smart baby
AHHH I CAN'T 😭♥️

HOW IS THIS STILL NOT TRENDING
Oh my god. Adorable.
It's really important to talk to kids like they are people instead of going, " Gaga booboo baybeeeee." Kids hate that shit.
Always makes me smile
Noice
Thats a Beautiful video.   Enjoy every second folks. 

The days are long but the years are short. 

It’s why we’re put on this earth in my opinion
This is adorable! I love doing this with every single baby that comes into my job. People think I'm just trying to be funny since I'm on the clock, but I do it with every baby I encounter. It's great for hastened language development.
My heart 😩🙌🏽🙏🏽❤️
Thanks, I needed to see this after the last half hour of getting pissed off over drunk drivers.
Too cute!! Awesome memory!
This is beautiful
u/vredditdownloader
So this is awesome. People who incessantly talk to their young children like “googoogahgah” (you know what I mean) are doing their child a major disservice. Talk to them how you would talk to anyone else and they will be far more linguistic.
Im not crying, you’re crying 😭😭
I have friends who are worse at talking then this little dude🤘🏻
Good job at “Daddying”, dad!  I’ve always done that with kids, and it’s tons of fun. You can even get very young babies to “coo” along with you, their little eyes tear up and they have as much fun as I do!
Who is this man, and will he please adopt me? But seriously though, this is some life-affirming, dope positive shit. Wishing him a very happy Father's Day from all our collective inner children.
"You know what I'm saying..."

I suspect he does know what you're saying, but he's wondering why you're constantly misunderstanding what he's saying.

"Yeah I know, but DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?!?!?"

Edit: Why is this down-vote worthy? It's a joke. I wasn't actually saying the child would be getting frustrated with being misunderstood, any more than I actually believe the child understands his father completely. Lighten up folks!
[removed]
R/wholesome would eat this right up
I wish I could give more than one up vote. I love this so much
New meme format incoming.

[TFW Apple makes a $1k stand](https://imgflip.com/i/32py97)
I clicked on this and I don't regret it! Love it :-)
That was wonderful. I could watch that all day. Thank you for sharing!
Dad's like this are the best! Great job, dad. Now, tell us what he was really saying?!
That nod!!
This made my morning.
This must be the cutest thing i have ever seeeeeeen, WTFFFF
The kid is like R2-D2. The audience cant really understand what he is saying but the characters can.
This kid's gonna have the gift of gab
That kid is going to grow up to be a genius
Haaahaaa aww that is awesome..hes just hanging out telling his tale
I wish I could upvote this twice!
My ovariiieeeessss
Oh my. This is the cutest baby video I've ever seen!
MY HEART.

When dad says, "Go somewhere else with that, but don't bring it here."  The way the baby looks at him, like, 'WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?'

I can't.
This is adorable!  They will both cherish this!
Truly adorable. Little man is going to be an eloquent man .
So cute! Now im just crying because of how cute it is!
Keep it up, and we’ll all call that baby “Dr.” soon enough.
Oh my gosh, this is so adorable!  The baby is so cute!  Love those little feets 😊
I absolutely love this! Take all the parenting books that you buy when you’re expecting and thrown in the trash. There’s so many lessons here... never “ baby talk” to your kids, validate what they’re saying no matter how outlandish it is (it builds so much confidence for them and social skills which are completely disappearing), laugh and smile while communicating, genuinely be interested in what they have to say, etc. I try every day to do this stuff with my son, he’s seven and I love every moment! I want to be friends with these two!!
They are both adorable. (Embarrassingly I do the same with my cats!)
Not only this is fucking adorable, but that dad... damn, he good looking
That kid will be amazing.
My daughter and I like to "walk and talk" so heartwarming.
This is one of my favourite videos, I love this.


That's going to be a well spoken kid
Cutest thing EVAR!
This made my day!
Expecting my first kid at the end of the month. The feelings right now are too much.
What a great dad!   So luv this!   Enjoy ur baby!
Cute baby.  Awesome dad.
This whole video is hilarious but I still think the best part is at the very beginning when he goes,

'But did you understand any of that?'

And the baby just shakes his head and is like 

'...Nah'

That's me on a pretty regular basis
How the dad kept it together is beyond me. I wouldnt started dying laughing
This is so cute!  


It's so much fun having a proper "conversation" with babies/lil' ones. My favourite thing to do with my nephew was pick a random subject and go "oh man ya know what I love?" and he'd babble and I'd go "Yes! You get it!" etc and it was just...fun and yeah. Lovely stuff :3
My mom sent me this video this morning I thought it was the cutest thing ever
Awesome to see dad conversing like an adult rather than use baby talk. This is great for the kid's speech and language development.
This reminds me of Killface and Simon talking.
There's videos of me doing this with my dad too, and I distinctly remember talking to him but him not understand what I was saying because it wasnt english, it was our little twin language xD.
Hey ya!
Omg, my heart! This is what I needed today. You can see the immense love he has for his child. It reminds of that Dave Chapelle skit when he was like, “You came from my nuts”
Haha I would do that with my niece when she was younger, but I would pretend like she was talking about politics or trends in the stock market lol
cute
They have the same demeanor. 😂 nice!
Great stuff there! That’s using language, learning the back and forth flow of conversation. Way to go Dad!
I love seeing babies and daddies. Great start to my day. TX op
What an opinionated little one! So into it, especially that nodding hahaha. Mom and dad better be ready for this kid!
Bro has listened to his drunk friends ramble on more than once.
omg this is so adorable!
This is so adorable, truly made my morning.
So cute 😭
does anyone else think that baby could fit in the sub r/13or30??? Still super adorable 😍
I want to die this is the cutest thing I have ever fucking seen wtf
Thanks a lot OP. I thought my wife and I were done with 3, our youngest being 5, but now we're gonna have to make another. Great.
That kid is going places
This is so pure and perfect. Good work, dad!
Hey. Stop making me want kids.
This is adorable as hell
Ah fuck my broveries
This is adorable
I miss those days lol
Does he know what your sayin?
This is so adorable!
I don’t like kids, but I like this a lot.
Wonderful and wholesome.
this made me smile this morning 😃
Made my day!
This is the adorableness I needed this AM!
Half the conversation was “you know what I’m saying” 

Even a baby could follow it. Still cute though
If someone asked me what the phrase “pride & joy” really meant, I think I’d have to show them this video. Dad’s smile says it all.
This is the adorableness I needed this AM!
I loved talking with my kids like this. Parenting can be so rewarding.
Where are the Dad's legs?!
I love the baby’s expressions, so cute.
Yknow wham sayin
Oh my gosh. I’m in no place to have kids right now but the baby fever is strong and this is noooot helping!! I love that little “tee hee”the baby laughs at the end. Adorable
This is fantastic.  When he nods his head just like his daddy its so adorable.
Omg this is officially the cutest thing on the whole internet.  That is dad goals right there. My heart exploded.
He makes some cogent points, but he could develop his arguments better.   He should put the strongest points first.
I agree with everything he said
So cute
That is cute af
Hahaha best sitcom on internet
Smart baby. Smart dad.
u/farttootfart
BROOOO IM USUALLY EMOTIONLESS BUT WTF, THIS IS SO FUCKING ADORABLE
What a chill dude.  The dad's pretty cool too.
I love doing this with babies. 
Baby "Babbles" 
Me "No way :O "
This is so wholesome. Can't wipe the stupid grin off my face. What an awesome dad, his happiness and charisma is infectious. As others have pointed out moments like this are also very helpful for language and social development.
"Waahhhgghuaaghha".... 
"...REALLY??"
lmao
Too cute! My LO knows some words but then throws in word salad in the middle of the words he knows, people ask me what did he say? 🤷‍♀️ something about the bus?
This is so so good for that baby! This is how children learn the back and forth of conversations. They are so cute 😭😭
Too cute!
I do the same thing with my cat.
I had an English teacher back in highschool that said it's good to speak to your child like they're an adult. He would have regular conversations with his kids telling them about what he has to do that day or he would talk to them about what's going on in the news as if they were able to understand him.
Well, that was a day brightening moment!
This kid is adorable... made my morning.

Dad ain't so bad either :)
This wins the internet for the month 😍😍😍
Grown up conversation before Daddy leave their nest
I could watch this all day!
My daughter is 18 months old and we have conversations a lot like this, it's incredible! Chatty babies and toddlers are the best thing ever.
I am new on here I am a loving caring woman looking for a serious relationship with an honest man someone honest to spend the rest of my life with forever and ever without no separate or divorced that what true love mean to me if you are looking for a serious relationship like I do textme 734 5O6 I276...
Duck bro making me tear up at the club

Edit: 🦆🦆
This is exactly what you’re supposed to do. Dad skills 💯
Yeah I know what you saying
Omg they are so cute I want to DIE. Also, I think the baby is having deep thoughts and I hypothesize that he will be genius. Hoping for an update in a few years
We have to agree that he had the whole point.
This is gold!!!
The most adorable conversation
that made my morning!
I have a Husky Malamute so this looks very familiar.

All in all - good dad.
Spoilers tag man! That baby was giving away critical plot points and I’m not caught up!!
This is the best thing ever! Throwback to my own son’s pre-language, but not pre-communication, days. We called that language “oogly oogly,” and it was adorable. He and his cousin would carry on lengthy conversations in that tongue 😂❤️
Lmfao! Man this is great!
This is parenting perfection. So adorable.
Oh my god she has so much personality. So cute.
That’s so great!!
First post I looked at today and it is a GREAT way to start the day, Absolutely awesome I love the kids expressions and that's a great dad!
I love this so much!
Is it me or does the dad look like collin sexton
Winning the internet today.  Holly cutenesses nussss nessss
They're both really cute.
You Sir You made my day

Magic dad moment - beautiful .
Lmaooo the baby's face at 1:10
I really needed that this morning. God damn, I can’t wait to have kids.
This is hysterical omg 😂 that baby is precious
That was funnier, and made more sense, than the finale of The Big Bang Theory
Those are some insanely important people skills being learned right there! Also that is just one of the cutest videos I’ve ever seen
Adorable!
Can we talk about the dad’s smile / white teeth
Cute!
This is better than most conversations I have with full grown adults.
The number of neurons being fired is off the charts, this is so good for kids. So is pretend reading
I bet the baby finally said 'you know what I'm saying'
You know what I'm sayin
The kid's got some strong opinions about the show.
I love towards the end, he was looking worried at the camera like, I don't know what this other guy is talking about hahaha
That is so cute, and the guy is a great parent! Had me smiling the whole time. Probably really good for the baby's development too.
This should be a vine
The dad we all wanted.
Drink everytime you hear "you know what I'm saying"
If this could be quadruple upvoted I would
This is beyond adorable, I don’t have the words! 🥰
Young actor incoming already more expressive than 99% of the adults I know
This is so good. Made me smile.
I’m pretty sure the baby knows what daddy’s saying.
I LOVE this video. What an awesome interaction with his kid.
His first words are gonna be "know what I'm saying?"
HAHAHAHAHA that full belly tho. Happy baby.
Man i can’t wait to be a dad someday and share funny little moments like this with my kids.
I as well think that survivor should mix it up a bit
Love this! ❤
This is so great. Sweet lil’ baby, sweet guy, sweet moment.
[This is actually really good for the baby] (http://www.first5california.com/learning-center.aspx?id=9&sub=111). Just hearing and engaging with a parent gets the baby’s brain to start thinking of new words, so this guy (and really any parent) should keep this up. Oh, and try to play some classical music too (I don’t have a link, but I recall some studies that suggest classical music helps boost brain function in babies).
So adorable!!!
Oh!!! That just made my morning, what a couple of cuties!!!!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Kid's conversation is also material for r/13or30
I'm not even a "baby person" and this is the cutest shit I've ever seen.
I absolutely love this!!  Daddy is so amazing with his baby.
OMG this is too cute ❤️
TOTALLY made my day!!!!!!! I love this!!!!
Since when does Metro Boomin have a kid?
somebody filmed me talking to a co-worker!
[deleted]
I remember this babbling period.  So fun the way they mimic adults.  Dad was funny.
At 0:45 , The Baby is like-- "Man are you sure about that Daddy"
So sweet
Adorable. But the guy kinda reminded me of the beloved Trailer Park Boys character J-Roc with all those “ya know what I’m saying”
I'm envious of black people's teeth. They're always so damn white.
.
I'm male and I think this just made me ovulate.
This is so wholesome <3
Lmao, hella cute. The baby looks like Draymond's son.
Oh come on now.... I’m a guy and I feel my invisible ovaries wanting a baby now. Must. Think. Of. Child. Raising. Costs.
Made my day!
After further investigating this video I feel like he's talking to a Sim player. Hmmm.
This is quite possibly the most precious thing I have ever seen in my life
Ugh, why can't I upvote this twice?
It makes me smile that he's not doing the *goo-goo ga-ga* shit with his baby. Talking to your baby/toddler like a normal human will help them communicate early on and possibly better.
I could watch hours of this.
Can we pool together the forces of Reddit in order to get this man nominated for the Father of the Year award?
I need more! I just want to go hang out with them and watch some tv. It might pull me out of my depression!
This is so awesome!
😍
Awesome display of top notch parenting.
this is the sweetest video! what totally cute kid and dad! <3
I do this with all babies, children and animals. Not as fun doing with full grown humans
This baby has my vote for president in 2068.
Omg, the both of you are just so beutiful ❤
Amazing. This reminds me of how Earn interacts with his daughter in Atlanta.
I dont know about you but I couldnt understand a word the dad was saying.
Ya know what I’m saying...
Haha this made my day.  Thanks for posting.
I love how he asked the baby what they said and it sounded like he/she repeated themself lmao
This made my morning!!! I am normally a little hateful in the morning or aka not a morning person! But this was so awesome and put a massive smile on my face!
This baby has more social skills than me.
This is so awesome Happy Father’s Day to that man! (It’s coming up soon enough)
I love this! Talking to babies is so important!! Pure love here :)
