He judged the hell out of you and decided you were safe.You may have saved his little life. *Moisturize me*Frogs drink through their skin, so you cooled him off and quenched him.  Way to go frog bro.He literally looks at the person filming before looking at the water and getting in. He steps in as if he may have to jump out, but apparently likes the tasty water, and gets more comfortable. This is some Wind in the Willows type shit.It‚Äôs the happy wriggle that does me in.I thought it couldn't get any cuter 

^And ^then ^the ^little ^cutie ^nestled ^right ^in"I accept your offering. You can now care for me for the rest of your life."

"Hello my baby, hello my darling, hello my ragtime gal!"This should be in r/HumansBeingBrosYou give the frog water to drink. Unknown to you, the frog pledges a life debt to you. In your darkest hour, the frog arrives. [deleted]Just have to say that anyone who would notice a random tree frog on a hot day, then go get him a drink, is destined to make the world a better place. Keep up the good work.That is so cute.. And it fits in that tiny cap, wasn't expecting that!Funny enough, throughout my life I never realized tree frogs were so small. Never saw one in real life, and the only pictures i occasionally saw were close up.It must have been so grateful. Just imagine crawling around a wall and a floating mini personal pool comes right up to you. What happened after that? Did you set him down in some shade?
If I fits, I sitsI love you OP. ‚ô•Ô∏è You just gave that frog the best day of his little life. My parents have a little tree frog that lives in an outdoor umbrella in their backyard in Atlanta. Whenever I‚Äôm there I take a spray bottle and spritz it like crazy, little dude must be hot. Love this post üôÇ You rule Nothing like heat to make a wild animal love humans. I live in Australia and the summers are quite harsh so once we had a parrot struggling in our back yard so I took him some water in a bowl and he instantly flew onto my head and starting flying down into the water to cool off. After about 15 mins once he cooled down he realised that he didn't need me anymore and the bastard bit my ear and flew off. You are a very good human OP!!Now he won‚Äôt croak!Ha that's great, I was expecting him to have a little slurp... Nope "dis my paddlin' pool"üòÅ *wiggle wiggle* ahhhhh...Ah, retreat!  The giant naked ape is here to eat me!

Strange tactics.  What is that water? A portable pond? 

 Well, I shouldn't be rude.  I will dip for just a moment.  

Ahhh, that's what my green needed.  Thank you kind citizen.The cold water on his hot skin must have felt absolutely ribbiting.Not many things here make me actually say 'aww' out loud, this is such an awesome little clipDID ANYONE NOTICE THE FROG PUT THAT LITTLE CHIN ON THE GUY‚ÄôS THUMB?!?! I just noticed and my cold, dead heart melted a little. Frogs actually drink through their skin so it make perfect (if adorable) sense.He's so cute! What a relief you must have given him üòäThis leapt into my heart!I like the part when he settles in and gets comfy. In addition to frogs being cold blooded they also drink through an osmotic patch of skin on their bellies.  So you did him a double favor but giving him a drink and some much needed cooling off.

Tiniest wading pool.I love frogs. They‚Äôre so sweet. Thank you OP for taking the time to do this. 

sidetone: if you roll them over on their back and rub their belly they will fall asleep. This is one of the cutest ‚Äúgiving an animal water‚Äù videos so far. Ahhh so cutePeople like you restore my faith in humanity! With all the crap in the world you make a froggy happy with a cap full of water ‚ù§ we all can learn from that!Froggo does a soakMy name is Frogg

I am so hot

Here comes a man

What has he got?

It is some water

So nice and cool

I will not drink my

New swimming pool!He fit perfect in there!It's been 3 full days since your plane crashed in this god forsaken desert and you are hungry, alone, and thirsty. Just when you were about to give up on life and welcome death into your arms, You see him. That frog you saved all those years ago. 

You could still remember how hot it was that day and how happy the frog looked as he jumped into that bottlecap filled with water. The frog remembered that too for he owes his life to you.

The frog looks at you then suddenly hops away, then out of instinct, you follow the frog until he leads you to a small oasis. You hop in and splash around. You drink and feel refreshed. Now the frog has fulfilled his promise he made all those years ago. Then the frog could finally be free. Be free of this cruel, cruel world.You have earned the blessings of Kek. You will have meme magic in your life for 420 years.Doing God‚Äôs work my friend. I have no gold but two thumbs and I raise them to you Frogs are specially equipped with a small pouch like area on there chest that let's them drink by absorbing water through there skin. Okay so when the water warmed up you made sure to refill it with more cold water right?commenting on a 3 year old posti love New ContentGood on you. But just for reference frogs don‚Äôt regulate their body temperature by sweating so heat index doesn‚Äôt effect them. Only the air temperature is what they feel. I found a dead lizard today by my house. Nothing wrong with him other than being dried out. I think he was dehydrated so we just put a random bowl of water on our porch for them What dis? Ah, pool? For me?? Why, thank you human!!https://i.imgur.com/hJeW2wX.jpgWas gonna call this a repost but then i realized this is 3 years old and idk how i am able to respond to a 3 year old post.awwAlways wanted to do thisSo since we‚Äôre talking about caring for small animals here I thought I‚Äôd bring up my awkward story from today! I was driving back from the store through my complex when I saw all these kids huddled around something round and brown. I assumed it was a baby bird because those fall out of trees all the time in my apartment complex and I‚Äôve rescued quite a few. They were all kind of poking at it and looking really interested so I was 99% sure it was an animal. I park my car, and start to walk over. As I‚Äôm getting the closer one of the boys picks up a big rock and slams it on whatever they are looking at. I freak out and shout while running over ‚ÄúNO WHAT ARE YOU DOING!‚Äù They all look at me, a crazy strange adult woman yelling at them like what the fuck? I look down and there‚Äôs no animal. It‚Äôs just playdoh. The mom then comes out and gives me an intense death stare. I anxiously explain that I thought it was an animal and I rescue birds that fall out of trees in the complex but she wasn‚Äôt amused. I walked away and physically cringed at how awkward it was. 

Welp that‚Äôs it If a 200-foot giant presented me with a kiddie pool while I was clinging to a cliff, I probably would climb in too.  I mean, at that point, how could that possibly be my worst option?This is so wholesome. You‚Äôre a damn saint. Omg the way he scrooches down in it is SO CUTE congrats on making it to the top posts of all timeHe *is* drinking while soaking! That‚Äôs how frogs do it! You‚Äôre a good hooman!Kind of amazing I will always love this post.. it is really cute how it just trusted youinsurmountable kindnessi love New ContentI love how he settles in and his lil eyes close like "oh yahhhh" ü•∞The internet has officially declared this the cutest thing ever.It must be so crazy being a little creature like that. Imagine you're burning up and this 800 ft tall giant just walks over carrying a swimming pool and holds it in your face. I'd be a little off put at first but if I judged it to be a nice giant id hop in too.so small and so sweetStupid question..... did you choose that bottle cap on purpose?? He would not have been able to fit in a smaller pop bottle cap.  Everything about this is just perfect.  Thank You!!!That wiggleüòçWhen you come from a long day at work and get in the poolOmg I love this. Little green frogs are seriously the cutestGud fregHe just risked his life for some water. Thanks for being awesome OPI love the sheer appreciation and relief on his face. He was like, ‚ÄúUgh, don‚Äôt fuck with me, it‚Äôs too hot.‚Äù Then was pleasantly surprised to realize you weren‚Äôt going to kill him. Sooo sweet! Ty for doing that.  Most people wouldn't even think to do that (myself included). I know now!/r/HumansBeingBros That frog looked at the camera/human and was like ‚Äúare you serious? For me? Okay, don‚Äôt mind if I do!‚Äù My wife is absolutely 100% *mortified* by even the sight of frogs.

I thought maybe... Juuuuuuuust *maybe* this tiny lil guy would crack even the lightest grin.

Nope.

This gets my upvote nonetheless. Quick, sign a contract with him!

Youll be able to summon him when youre in a tough spot You're an awesome person. Frog greatly appreciated that. He can absorb moisture threw his skin so. Great to see there's still caring people out there. Not morons who'd try to crush it or set it on fire. Sick world we live in. Tree frogs are awesome. If you got him on your hand you could feel the sticky pads on his feet heh. You offered him a sipp, he took a dipp Frogs don‚Äôt physically drink water, they absorb water directly through their skin in an area known as the 'drinking patch' located on their belly and the underside of their thighs. 

EDIT: Just realized this has been commented before.He will tell his spawn the tale of the day a mythical godgiant saved him with a flying pond. You have a frog a bath and now you're the #3 post of all timeI sent this to four of my friends and their responses were so sweet, they're all 17-19 year old dudes.
