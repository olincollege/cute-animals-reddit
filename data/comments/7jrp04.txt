I can definitely see why that dog needs a solid brick wall in order to be kept in the yard

Hello......CanI......Sniff....Yourbutt

He jumps the same direction from the same spot every time. I find that hilarious 
Its almost as if its a dog cutout on a rotating wheel hahaha

WOW Moon Moon, haven't heard that name in about 4 years. 

He was a special kind of dog!

Moon Moon is also the name of a popular twitch streamer, hence the weird seemingly out of context comments.

Is anyone going to say anything about how OP is letting the dog just sit in the middle of the road while he's focusing on getting the right shot?
Looks to me like he's stuck on a water wheel. Let's hope someone gets him the help he needs.

Why do dogs always lose their shit when they see another dog? It doesn't seem to matter, any time one dog sees another, it will do everything in its power to get to that dog, to the point of constantly jumping high enough over a brick wall just to *look* at the other dog.
LISSEN CHAT
Get the dog out of the middle of the road! 
The legend of moon moon lives on 
HEY

I like how the brick wall is patched up, almost like he has broken through it a couple times
MY family and I were visiting cousins once and we decided to go for a walk around the block. At one point we came to this fence and we see this light tan colored head bobbing up and down. It had what we thought was long hair so we thought it was a little girl jumping up and down on a trampoline in their backyard. It turned out to be a dog with long fur.

Thats a dog, not my BALDing dad. Moon2S

Joke's on you... That's 4 different huskies. 
My dog just passed, this made me laugh, thanks. 
It is like a revolution of the moon around the earth if you think about it. 
Love it.  This Husky has figured out if it runs and jumps it gets a longer looksee then if it jumps straight up.  Smart Husky.

Why is he letting it stand in the middle of the road? 
Living in a city where there's a million shitty drivers, it bothers me that the person recording is just letting their dog stand in the street while the focus on recording the cute jumping dog
Thanks for getting me to die laughing in the middle of choir warmups... and then making my friends have the same reaction.

Does anyone else see a husky cutout on a revolving wheel?
Moon Moon has hops.
Serious question. Whats the difference between the type of leash you seen in the gif and one of those retractable ones that go like 20 feet? I am wanting to adopt my first dog (not a puppy, but a 20-50 pound or whatever I fall in love with) within the next month or so and am trying to gather up a list of all the things I want to buy before I get a dog.
I wish I could be Moon Moon's friend!

I can hear the Super Mario jumping sound every time I see his head pop up.
This makes me laugh but also makes me sad.  Poor pupper wants a friend but will be exhausted until he gets one.
Not friend, girl friend. want something more..
Oak tree. Brick subdivision wall. Trampoline. Where in Florida is this?
Hi friend I'm here You can even see where they patched over it's last escape...
Why the name Moon Moon? 
Have lab mix: she kept jumping our 4ft fence... she's an inside dog now. :)  this video made my day!!
This is so cute
BALDUKEN!!
I think that Dogus has his own merry-go-round. That would explain it.
Your dog has been now taught it's ok to chill in the middle of a road.  Careful man, noone wants an accidents to happen if he ever is off the leash.
Your dog is standing in the road...

He was in disbelief üòÇ
If this dog wasn't on the chain, I'm sure he would jump over the fence .
I love all dogs so much. But there is something so eerie about most Husky dogs I've met. They seem like they have alien personalities compared to other ones. 


On the bright side, Moon is in great shape.Ôªø
That's not roadhog.
Who the fuck is Moon Moon
It's like he's on a little ferris wheel lol 
I'd like this to be photoshopped at the Mexico/ US wall where the leashed dog is a patrol dog and Moon Moon has a sombrero. 
I can't stop thinking about how that dog is just standing in traffic while the owner is safe on the sidewalk. 
Get the dog a friend. :-)
Oh my goodness my heart <3
This is possibly the most beautiful thing I've seen all day.

My dog growing up used to do that to my neighbors constantly. They didn't even have a dog, he just wanted to say hi to them. They hated it so they built the wall higher, up to 8 feet. Our dog just jumped higher and they gave up.
Sad part is that this is likely a sign from the dog that it‚Äôs owner doesn‚Äôt exercise it enough or give it enough attention. 
i haven't seen that name for a while
anyone get annoyed when the camera moves.
Lol..this record raised my spirits

And this is exactly why you should install rollers on the top of any fence with a Husky or similar breed dog: https://youtu.be/aAC_JTdsTCw
Can confirm. Have 2 huskies...we fill the bottom of the fence with bricks and somehow, they still get out. We've started build the fence higher too üòÇüòÇ
Every time the doggo jumps I can hear it go " Hey!... Can I... Sniff... Your butt...."
Anyone else bothered by the fact that the other dogs owner is fine with it being in the middle of the road?
This seriously brightened my day! Thanks!

I don't know why but the fact the dog has a right-to-left arc each time somehow makes it even better than if it was just up and down.
Is that the dog that was jumping happily on a trampoline until it saw someone recording it?
Someone has a pack of dogs and is throwing them behind this wall. Must looks really fun how he runs back to his old position just to jump again.
