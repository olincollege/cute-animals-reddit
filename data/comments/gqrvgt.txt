That dog is so smart!
Ok stick flip number 2 was fucking sick.
Give a dog a stick and he'll play fetch for a day. Teach a dog how to play fetch by himself and he'll play for a lifetime
It's so sad when they grow up and don't need you anymore.
This dog has more creativity and coordination than some people i know..
The dog's of one of my friend refuse that you touch his ball. It's his ball, and no one but him get to play with it.

So, he takes the ball, and throw it as far as he can, and then run after it.   
There's a slight slope on their yard. So, when he is tired to throw the ball with his mouth, he goes on top of the slope, release the ball, let it go for a little while, and then run after it.
He'll be appointed to branch manager in no time.

This reminds me of a game my father taught me with a coaster. You balance the coaster on the edge of the tabel, flip it with the back of your hand and then catch it in the air.
I'm sure I not the only one who does this?
It was a bartender in its previous life
This dog has more braincells than me
We play this in Nepal. Dandi bew. We want this dog in our national squad
Only child, for sure.
I’d class this as tool use.
Did he dig that trench just to get his nose under the stick, or is it just the result of him doing this all day long?

When the owner stops playing fetch...
The person filming this: “hmm yes, the world only needs to see this amazing feat for 5 seconds” *stops camera*

I want mooooore dammit!
I met a Koolie today who was doing this with clods of dirt. Would stick his nose into some soft dirt, launch a clod then either bite it or hit if with his snout so it would explode. Owner said he doesn't dig with his paws, but instead uses his nose and plays this game.

What is it about dogs that I can sit here for ten solid minutes looking at this clip going “awww SUCH A SMART GOOD BOY” and giggling?
And he is good at it
My cats figured this out too. If I won't play fetch with them, they'll grab a toy with one claw and throw it, then chase after it.
Is it normal that I also play like this when alone!!!
I know no one gonna read this but still!!
Its indian game called gilli danda....
He is not good boy anymore >!He is a smart boy :) !<
Cute vid. Down voted for "doggo"
The act of having fun is a highly developed aspect of intelligence. I was reading somewhere that fun is an extension of play fighting that most animals do but fun tends to serve no real purpose from a physiological standpoint compared to play fighting which makes it a higher level intelligence process.


This is awesome

Well yes, yes he did

Aww this makes me sad! I’m imagining that no one would play fetch with him so he taught himself.

No drop. Only throw.

That's an orphan dogs game. I've seen them play it around the shelter

In Istanbul there's lots of stray dogs, many of which really know how to entertain themselves. I once witnessed a cute stray dog (about a year old) at the hagia sofia square invent a cool game: he took a rock into its mouth, threw it up really high and started chasing it. I watched the dog repeat that for about 5 minutes. It surely was entertaining in the waiting line for the tourist attractions.
This dog is training for its next catch a stick contest.
That trench though

I used to play that as a kid.

Wow so the dog knows how to play catch by himself.
No been done before I did that same thing last week it just realized it on its own what a smart dog
Lucky this dog haven’t born in China! Would have been eaten already..
As kids growing up in India, we used to play a game similar to it. Love dogs.
It's self-sustaining now
Fine. I’ll do it myself.

Autaully this game does exist its called dandi biyo in nepal and is our national game but when you lift the stick you hit it with something like a bat and whoever thows the furthest wins.Theres that And no one read this.....

Disclaimer: May emotionally scare children...
Reminds me of when my dog snagged a plastic grocery bag and was running around the yard with it (keep away is his favorite). He let it go and the wind took it across the yard, stopping on the opposite fence.  He ran, grabbed it, brought it back across the yard to release again, repeated 3-4 times.  Very funny game fetch played solo.

Human: No

This is a great example of how intelligent, high-energy, and task-oriented collie breeds are. They need space and a ton of environmental enrichment. I see too many people adopt these guys because they're cute, and then they are overwhelmed when their new collie won't stop digging in their tiny suburban yard or herding their children.

Throw the stick for him....
This is brilliant... I love seeing animals able to create and think right in front of our eyes
What breed of dog is this?
Man, I wish I could get so happy by playing such a simple game. Doggos are pure joy.
Improvise. adapt. overcome.
A similar game is played in India (by humans lol). It uses the same principal of using a shallow dug out area like the kne in the gif, and you balance a small stick within its edges. You use a jigger stick to then hit it.
The throw your own stick trick.
When a dog is smarter than you
“Oh my God!...Hooman, you are dismissed!”
There is similar game called[ Dandi biyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandi_Biyo) but for human.

I've seen soldiers play a game of sticks like this on YouTube.
It's like ball in a cup, but 10 million times cuter.
I once saw a dog climb out of a pond, throw a ball in, then go fetch it, and repeat.

Well its a childhood game we used to play  in India and its just like cricket/baseball bit some different rules.
Aww

I am a legend in that game. Maybe I can teach that pro dog
Okay, more time to see if I can catch this stick...position it, push it with my snout, it’s in the air, and yes, I caught it! 37 times, now Ima gonna try for 38...

Wait until EA sports hears about this. Instant pay wall for the doggo and micro transactions for the stick to be thrown in the air. 

Get the stick for free, but need to pay to throw it in the air.
Wow
Look a his tail 
I wish i be happy as this dog
hmm dog makes up his own game and nobody see's it as the dog trolling his owner ;)
Brilliant ‼️🐶💕
Serious question, does anyone knows why dogs love we human throw some object so that they bring it back to us?!

Dog bottle flipping
Can you imagine if dogs had this strong irrational urge to fetch balls and sticks. Some sort of inexplicable satisfaction like people popping bubble wrap.

And that's why they look so distraught when we feint, it could be frustration.

Next doggo should do my homework
Holy shit! Let’s elect him/her President!!
That's a good boi.
My neighbor’s dog Clover would do this for hours. She has gone and past, but this has convinced me that reincarnation seems right.
The fact that he threw it up in the air and caught it means he's not stupid.
Don't just stand there, go play with him/her!
SUCH a smart boii!!💕

Dog: Every forrest is giant toy store with million items and it is free.
Who needs a hooman?
Doggo saw someone throwing a ball up and catching it. Doggo wanted to do that and figured out how to throw a stick up and catch it.
Put your damn phone down and play fetch with the dog!
Aww, buddy. Come to me, I'll throw the stick for you!
Yeah, but what is it though?
It’s called flick the stick 😄😄😄😄
Looks like we're not the only ones bored during quarantine
Snoots and Ladders?

Ditch flip us great!
He’s about to get all the bitches
Kids before smart phones.
It reminds me of that game where you put a pencil on your first and try to catch it each time.
That's not new, I used to do that as a kid

I play this game with beer mats on the table! Flip em up from the edge and try and catch it again flat! 

Not sure if dogs are smart or I'm simple...
I would call that game Snout Stick.
Fetchn't
You know how when you throw a popcorn in the air and try to catch it with your mouth?

This is that for the dog.
one of my labs does this with her bones and toys.  she flings them across the room/deck/backyard and chases after them just like this.
Wholesome ! What a smart doggo

I wonder if the dog will still jump for the stick if the owner threw it upwards
cattle dogs are the smartest
Slowly they approach sentience...
Our Hazel, a pitbull pup, would love playing with this little cutie. They would make up the most amazing games to play!
This is bad.

Dogs no longer need hooman to throw stick.

End of the world.
Doggo is smarto.
the second try tho !
My dog does this all the time with sticks. Just flips them in the air and catches them.
So smart but the poor baby needs a puppy playmate!
This is like the dog version of flip the bottle

I am currently dog sitting a 1yo bloodhound pup and he likes to spin those tug of war ropes with his mouth, toss them up in the air, and catch them. I feel like he’ll work his way up to this kind of game.
Second one was so smooth. This dogs got a future ahead of him!
Smart creatures play games.
I love this so much! 🥰
He’s throwing his own stick! I like a dog that keeps himself busy...

Who's a good boy! Clever dog.
A neighbor growing up had a black lab that loved tennis balls Rocky would retrieve that ball no matter how often it was thrown he could be fucking asleep hear it hit the ground and he was off.  Trouble is humans would tire of throwing the ball so he did something I havent seen another dog do.  He would stand on one side of the ball until the pressure exerted on the ball caused it to travel in the opposite direction and chase after it.  Crazy intelligent dog.
Dog.
Intelligent doggo......
I like his style.. And the cut of his gib. Whatever that means.. 😅
You know what they say:

Throw a stick for a dog and have him entertained for 10 minutes,  
Teach a dog to throw his own stick and he will be entertained for life.
What breed is doggo? Looks just like mine!
Awww I feel so sorry for him he needs a friend :(
Oh no, give them a hundred years more and they wont need humans anymore.

EDIT: But wait, doggos dont deserve humans. Way to go doggo
Just saw a video of a car accident with 2 dead (/r/idiotsincars). This helped bring me back.
wow nice doggo
That is one smart doggo!!
D-O-G
Smort little doggo, so cute
he has no one to play catch with so he devised a high-tech plan to dig a small canal but not to fill with water, but you can place a stick thats long enough to fit across the diameter of the canal, and put your snout under the stick and thrust your snout upwards. depending on the sheer force you can launch it into the air high enough to catch your stick.
