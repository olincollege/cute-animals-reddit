That dog is so smart!
Ok stick flip number 2 was fucking sick.
Give a dog a stick and he'll play fetch for a day. Teach a dog how to play fetch by himself and he'll play for a lifetime
It's so sad when they grow up and don't need you anymore.
This dog has more creativity and coordination than some people i know..
The dog's of one of my friend refuse that you touch his ball. It's his ball, and no one but him get to play with it.

So, he takes the ball, and throw it as far as he can, and then run after it.   
There's a slight slope on their yard. So, when he is tired to throw the ball with his mouth, he goes on top of the slope, release the ball, let it go for a little while, and then run after it.
He'll be appointed to branch manager in no time.

This reminds me of a game my father taught me with a coaster. You balance the coaster on the edge of the tabel, flip it with the back of your hand and then catch it in the air.
I'm sure I not the only one who does this?
It was a bartender in its previous life
This dog has more braincells than me
We play this in Nepal. Dandi bew. We want this dog in our national squad
Only child, for sure.
I‚Äôd class this as tool use.
Did he dig that trench just to get his nose under the stick, or is it just the result of him doing this all day long?

The person filming this: ‚Äúhmm yes, the world only needs to see this amazing feat for 5 seconds‚Äù *stops camera*

I want mooooore dammit!
I met a Koolie today who was doing this with clods of dirt. Would stick his nose into some soft dirt, launch a clod then either bite it or hit if with his snout so it would explode. Owner said he doesn't dig with his paws, but instead uses his nose and plays this game.

My cats figured this out too. If I won't play fetch with them, they'll grab a toy with one claw and throw it, then chase after it.

The act of having fun is a highly developed aspect of intelligence. I was reading somewhere that fun is an extension of play fighting that most animals do but fun tends to serve no real purpose from a physiological standpoint compared to play fighting which makes it a higher level intelligence process.

In Istanbul there's lots of stray dogs, many of which really know how to entertain themselves. I once witnessed a cute stray dog (about a year old) at the hagia sofia square invent a cool game: he took a rock into its mouth, threw it up really high and started chasing it. I watched the dog repeat that for about 5 minutes. It surely was entertaining in the waiting line for the tourist attractions.
This dog is training for its next catch a stick contest.
That trench though

Reminds me of when my dog snagged a plastic grocery bag and was running around the yard with it (keep away is his favorite). He let it go and the wind took it across the yard, stopping on the opposite fence.  He ran, grabbed it, brought it back across the yard to release again, repeated 3-4 times.  Very funny game fetch played solo.

This is a great example of how intelligent, high-energy, and task-oriented collie breeds are. They need space and a ton of environmental enrichment. I see too many people adopt these guys because they're cute, and then they are overwhelmed when their new collie won't stop digging in their tiny suburban yard or herding their children.

Throw the stick for him....
This is brilliant... I love seeing animals able to create and think right in front of our eyes
What breed of dog is this?
Man, I wish I could get so happy by playing such a simple game. Doggos are pure joy.
Improvise. adapt. overcome.
A similar game is played in India (by humans lol). It uses the same principal of using a shallow dug out area like the kne in the gif, and you balance a small stick within its edges. You use a jigger stick to then hit it.
The throw your own stick trick.

Can you imagine if dogs had this strong irrational urge to fetch balls and sticks. Some sort of inexplicable satisfaction like people popping bubble wrap.

And that's why they look so distraught when we feint, it could be frustration.

Who's a good boy! Clever dog.
A neighbor growing up had a black lab that loved tennis balls Rocky would retrieve that ball no matter how often it was thrown he could be fucking asleep hear it hit the ground and he was off.  Trouble is humans would tire of throwing the ball so he did something I havent seen another dog do.  He would stand on one side of the ball until the pressure exerted on the ball caused it to travel in the opposite direction and chase after it.  Crazy intelligent dog.

Smort little doggo, so cute
he has no one to play catch with so he devised a high-tech plan to dig a small canal but not to fill with water, but you can place a stick thats long enough to fit across the diameter of the canal, and put your snout under the stick and thrust your snout upwards. depending on the sheer force you can launch it into the air high enough to catch your stick.
