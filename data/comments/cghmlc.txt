You can‚Äôt spell ‚Äúsuffocation‚Äù without ‚Äúcat‚Äù.
Ahhhh, sleep catnea. Scary affliction indeed.
Our old 30lb black cat sat on my dads chest once as he fell asleep on the couch. Woke up in the dark thinking he was having an asthma attack only to see two green eyes looking back at him.
*"shhhhh, sleep now, human. It's just a dream."*
How did he know he wasn't breathing when he was asleep?
Spoiler alert, he doesn't own a cat!!
Is it just me or is the facehugger alien cute?
This is why you shouldn't let cats sleep with babies.

Isn't this how that one dude dies in Catch 22?

I don‚Äôt buy the caption but it‚Äôs still a cute picture
Hooman, you seem to be breathing. Allow me to fix that.
He protek. He attak. He wants your soul for midnight snack.
Aaaah, Silence of the man!
This is how I want to die
Ahhhhhh, Jon, it's all good. Now sleep.
I feel like you would figure out the issue when you woke up..  not certain why cameras were installed..
Look at that cat's face.
It really wants that man dead.

Further proof that sleeping on your side is the correct way of sleeping.
Paranormal Cativity
r/thathappened if the guy was having trouble breathing while asleep to the point he for some reason felt the need to tape himself he probably would have woken up gasping for air and caught the caught on his face at least once or there would have been cat hair on his face etc
Plot twist: He doesn't have a cat
This reeks of made up, if you're having trouble breathing while sleeping why would you set a camera up? That's ridiculous
It's creepy when the cat steals your breath at night.
And the movie Cat's Eye made you believe that it was a gremlin...

We all know gremlins mess with planes and electronics!
I find it hard to believe he needed a camera to figure this out.
I like the pic, but I feel like the title belongs on /r/thathappened. How would someone not notice this? And even if they legit slept through it why would their first action be to install a camera on their bed?

I have a cat. I can't breathe when I'm sleeping. Nonetheless, innocent until proven guilty. Time to order some cameras.
Plot twist: not his cat
I looked at this way too long thinking it was a video.

He had to install a camera instead of just...waking up and finding the cat on his face?

Sleep Catnea
Well there‚Äôs the problem: you‚Äôre still wearing your watch.
Reminds me of a really old movie where a cat would try to literally steal your breathe away.  I forgot the name, anybody know?  I think it was a horror movie
This is on r/aww but little does anybody realize that this cat is attempting to assassinate his owner
did he have a cat before that picture was taken?
This guy probably has sleep catnea.
I'm 52 years old. When I was a child, I remember hearing that you should never have a cat in the house while there is a young infant in the home. Supposedly, cats would sit on the chest of a baby and "suck" the breath out of them. 

I'm not sure if anyone else heard this tale... it scared me as a child though.
Paranormal Cativity
Did anyone else think it was a video and waited entirely too long for it to move?
Guy probably: "I love my kitty! She is so cute!"

Cat: "Yes human, take your last breaths and I will feast upon your corpse!"
Who sleeps while wearing a watch?!?! 

Christ does he also wear his shoes to bed as well?
things that didn‚Äôt happen for 1000, alex
I assume we all know this is fake, right?
It‚Äôs ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù protecting him from that shitbag troll trying to steal his breath....don‚Äôt you all know a good kitty when you see one?
How did he know he couldn't breathe while sleeping?  Didn't he wake up when he stopped breathing?
Shhhh, it'll all be over soon human, and I'll become more powerful than you could imagine.

How's else did you think cats got nine lives.
Here to find out he doesn't even own a cat.
he doesnt have a cat
That cat knows *exactly* what he's doing.
This is a legit reason as to why cats shouldn't be around sleeping babies unattended. They don't mean any harm, but it can have awful consequences.
Watched this for a good minute before I realized it wasn‚Äôt a video

Cat's Eye was right.
"shhh, it'll all be over soon"
Our schnauzer literally does this to my girlfriend every night...
The unconditional love. ‚ô•
I can relate when my 14 lb bundle of joy lays on my stomach and chest at night. I wake up with my back being so stiff that I can't move. Subconsciously, I know it's her so I make sure I am still for her while I'm sleeping. I guess whatever Jedi mind tricks she does at night, works. We are after all the inferior species.
I love this so much üòªüòªüòª
How do you sleep so deep that you can‚Äôt feel a cat get onto your face?? Genuinely? I may get a cat for the sleep benefits!
Sleep Catnea
beware all parents of small children with a cuddly kitty... or not, it's up to you.
So when he woke up with the cat on his face, he still needed a camera to crack the case?
Catch 22 anyone? No, just me? Okay....
What a catastrophe.
If he knew he couldn't breath, then I assume he wakes up in the middle of the knight. Thus wouldn't he wake up and see the cat?
r/animalsbeingjerks
*holds monkey‚Äôs paw and makes wish

‚ÄúWait that‚Äôs not at all what I wanted to be smothered in.‚Äù
My cat vs. sleep problem is that my cat will sit next to my head when I'm asleep and sloooowly move to put his nose so close to my cheek I can feel him breathing and it wakes me up. He doesn't bite or lick my face or sniff me, he just fucking hovers there.  I mean a millimeter from my face, close enough to feel the warmth of his breath and fuzz on his upper lip. He's not asleep, he's awake and does it on purpose when he wants to be petted at 3 am. It's like waking up with someone standing over you. He's a total asshole, so when I find him sleeping I do it back. He *hates* that.
Just me, or was anyone waiting for the picture to load like a video?
Plot twist. OP doesn't have a cat.

He sleeps with a watch on?
What kind of savage sleeps with their watch on?
Cat suffocation is actually a real thing you need to be careful about if you have young children. They just cuddle up on the baby‚Äôs face before they are old enough to be able to roll over or push the cat off
He needed camera to figure that out!!!!
I guess its not sleep apnea.
Where was the little troll? Fuckers are evil.
Shhhh, shhhhh, human, it will all be over soon.

You can't post this picture and not post the rest of them as well where you can see the cat creepily staring at him, then sitting on his chest, and then finally draping itself over his face.
none of this adds up. like "oh i cant breath. Let me buy a camera." Also if someone cant breath wouldnt they, you know, wake up.

"I love you hooman, Imma cuddle your face!"
My husband had a nightmare where a boa constrictor was choking him. He woke up to the cat laying on his neck.
I had a cat that would do this to any girl that slept in the bed with me.  It was pretty hilarious.
A couple years back when we were living in an apartment complex, we found this cat at a man's doorstep in the cold just lying there, He let us approach so we put him in a box and then we took him in, took him to the vet the next day who said he was perfectly healthy, so we took him in until we could find him a new home. The first night we let him roam about the apartment, he and our long-time cat came into the bedroom, our cat laid cuddled up next to my wife's legs and the new cat decided to lay on my chest, nuzzle his head against my neck and shoulder and put either paw on either side of my neck like he was giving me a big hug. I woke up to him in this position and my arms around him so I cuddled him a bit but then put him down. We did eventually find him a home but he was such a great cat, we named him Lynx.

this is what you get for not feeding me my favorite snack.

Why do ppl have to make up fake stories for these pics?
@stluis_htx is his twitter account
I also use a camera to diagnose what would appear to be a medical issue.
Who TF sleeps with their watch on? No wonder his cat was trying to take him out.
Was that fake title really necessary?
r/stevenuniverse
That title makes zero sense.

If he knew he was having trouble breathing at night, he probably woke up at least once due to that. In that case he would obviously have noticed a cat sleeping on his face, no?
Fake. If you can‚Äôt breathe you‚Äôd most likely wake up to gasp for air and see the cat on your face. How would he even remember he can‚Äôt breathe while sleeping?
People with sleep apnea are not aware of their condition in many cases, unless they wake up gasping.
So he could tell that he couldn‚Äôt breath when sleeping but couldn‚Äôt tell that there was a cat on his face?
That‚Äôs not awww at all. That‚Äôs dangerous, unsanitary, and the cat is trying to establish dominance
I want one
Hungry Joe anyone?
I stared at this for a solid minute waiting to see the cat move until I realized it was a picture.
I'm sure it's been said 50 times already

But this looks like a case of sleep purralysis.
What kind of psycho sleeps on their back?
Being covered in fur every morning didn't give it away?
This is why I sleep with the door closed.
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs cute. I think the cat selfishly was trying to quiet the snoring noise.

This is why you don't allow your pets to watch groundbreaking Academy Award winning movies with tragic endings.

Cat will probably pick up his water bowl and smash it through the window and run off into the night.
Only way the cat can get him to stop snoring.
A literal catnap
When i first got my cat she would snuggle under my beard in the winter. Now shes a total spaz and hides under the bed.
Storytime:

Dad had a cat that hated most people, except for him and mom. This cat would climb the drapes in their bedroom, wait until dad got up to get her down and then run down the drapes like a bat out of hell and hide under the bed. Crazy cat, for the life of me can't goddam remember her name...

Well, when I was born the cat took the crazy to a whole new level and climbed into my crib at about 6 months old and sat on my chest and tried to shove her face into my mouth. Essentially a mini version of the above except with a baby.

Cats are fricken crazy homicidal muffins on legs, I have 6 of them!

Man, I know this is random but I just lost my cat three days ago and she looks a lot like that and that shit just hurt me right nowüòî I never got lucky to cuddle with me like that
I have a similar problem with my dog. He gets on my bed while I am sleeping and practically pins my legs down while lying on them and wakes me up, like I panic but then I see him and fall back to sleep, but he takes me out of REM cycle. I regret letting him sleep with me but if I don't he whines like I am torturing him. I don't know how to fix the problem.

Worth it. Good kitty wanted some love.
At least it‚Äôs not a tiny goblin...
My cat does this too, except he puts his butt right on your face.
The scariest thing is he wears a watch to sleep

Edit: I can spell
How could a dead person install a camera?
That cat definitely knows what it‚Äôs doing.
And somehow I survive each night with 4 cats vying for space on my face. 

Actually only the youngest likes to try to suffocate me. He sort of flops on my face, it's how he snuggles I guess. But if I slowly move enough to breathe he doesn't seem to notice.  The other three are happy to either lounge on my hip or risk their very lives by sleeping by my very kicky feet.
Swap the cat with a dog and you got a picture of me
Awww? You don‚Äôt know cats do you?
All I can think of is the latest season of Strabger Things. "Try not to move. It'll soon be over."
This is for changing my brand of Kitty litter.
So he needed a install a camera to tell him the cat was on his face. I call. Bullshit.
How did my cat get there!!!
As a light sleeper...how the fuck does that not wake you up!?
Best way to die
Sweet burden.XDDD
That‚Äôs sleep paralysis right there
It's trying to steal his soul...
Now he has a hard decision to make. The cat laying on his damn face while he sleeps is clearly a problem, and the only quick solution I can think of is to lock the cat out of the room while he sleeps. But that cat clearly adores him, so if I were him I'd feel terrible for doing it.
Why would a camera help someone figure out why they can‚Äôt breathe while they sleep? Very irrational caption for a repost.
Shhhh Dave, just let it happen...
Who the heck thinks to install a camera when they have a hard time breathing when they're sleeping?!
As if he wouldn't make up from not being able to breathe and find his cat on his face..
I thought this was a video and I was waiting for it to move..
The Versa is stupid .. there is no way that is comfortable to sleep in.
Kinda reminds me of the movie "Cat's Eye".

He's stealing your breath.
Reminds me of Alien.

Hello my baby hello my honey....
How‚Äôd he know he couldn‚Äôt?
I don‚Äôt understand how would u know that he can‚Äôt breathe if he‚Äôs asleep because if he woke up from it he would see a cat on top of him
Now that‚Äôs where the neighbors cat went.
Wait till the end, it's hilarious!
Who is Erica ?
No wonder. He's allergic to cats!
Pretty sure he didn't need a camera to figure out what was going on
My golden would do this to me. 

Imagine that cat replaced by a 30pound dog.
Took me way too long to realise this wasn‚Äôt a video.
The new Paranormal Cativity movie looks pretty dope
My kitten does this. Not looking forward to him becoming a 12 pound ball of purring suffocation
this is why babies and cats should never be left alone together, at least according to my mom.

When my grandmother gave birth to my father they sold their two siamese cats. They were afraid of what you can see on the pic

Coincidently, he also discovered why he'd wake up with a furry tongue..
Reaffirms my theory that cats subsist not on food, but the life force of human beings.
So you didn't buy a feline breathing mask??
I'd fucking shit myself if I felt something on top of me while sleeping. When I was younger, some cousins came to my house. One of them was like 5. I was asleep. For some fucking reason she decided to come my room and just stand there. I can't explain the dread I felt when I woke up to her breathing. I wasn't thinking clearly and very nearly punched her. Good thing I decided to stand up and just turn on the lights.

he's just trying to stop the little troll in the wall from stealing his breath...
Strangely the hairballs didn't tip him off.
A cat knows why
This is good way to die honestly
Shirt and a watch? Did he put on his work clothes before going to bed?
This is why cats can‚Äôt be around babies.
Good for snugs
Plot twist: the man does not own a cat.
Like a face hugger from alien except a cat

I had a roommate who moved out & she left her cat (until she could take it at her new place) & that is when I started waking up in the morning with a cat curled up on my face.
That's not aww, that's how babies suffocate and die.
Did anyone else think this was a gif at first and just stare at it for him to jump awake.
Ooooo my!
I watched this video for a really long time. Too long.
Ah ha ha ha!!!
That's some Purranormal Activity going on right there.
What's the name of that movie where the little goblins try to steal your life Force through your breath, and the cats protect you?
Ain‚Äôt no love like cat love
Initially I didn't look at the picture carefully enough and thought I saw a spider crawling into his mouth.
Does this man sleep on a mountain of pillows? All I see is pillows everywhere
Shhhhhh nothing but dreams now.
Those alien facehuggers are evolving
Cat: "Shh shh shh...sleep forever"
Cat tries to suffocate owner while sleeping
Fools. The cat knew what it was doing.
The twist: He has sleep apnea and the cat is trying to align his jaw for better airflow.

Edit: A word.
I am Jeffrey Dahmer's kitty.

I must smother you so you can never leave my side!

Except,


when I go to eat, then, and only then, will I let you up....
Since cats find snoring to be a sign off aggression and they are compelled to snuff it out

A ghost cat??!!
It's just a cat allergy, take some antihistamines , you'll be fine...
The cat just wants his inheritance early.
Obstructive sleep catnea
Any man who sleeps with a watch on deserves their fate
We all know who the benefactor to his insurance policy is.
I can't decide. Cute or morbid?
My grandpa used to hate cats, and his only explanation as to why was ‚Äúthey‚Äôll steal your breath‚Äù. You were right, old man. You were right.
I like how this cat is low-key suffocating his owner and this is posted in /awww
Cat'sEye: Cat's will steal your breath
ladies and gentleman we got him
The cat has noticed his breathing problems also and is investigating
KITTY LUV RITE HERE
Why does the cat look like it's blushing?
That‚Äôs called sleep catpnea. It‚Äôs deadly. There are c-catp machines to help with that. I have one and I sleep like a baby now.
Where do I get one of these masks for my CPAP machine?
His lungs must be filled with hair balls
That's nightmare stuff, not awww
Aw who needs to breathe anyway.  I want a fuzzy face hugger.
