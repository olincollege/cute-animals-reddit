Ooooh feeling!! I love you grandma
I want to do that when I'm old
I segment of my job is inspecting assisted living facilities. She has her gait belt on and with a x3 staff assist...

I approve.
As an ER nurse I’m torn between thinking this is badass and adorable, and imagining having to take report on this from EMS if this went down wrong: “Okay so they were — do what now?” 

Overall 10/10 adorable.
For a while it was hard to tell if granny liked or not...but I'm glad she did
I want to hear that ladies laughter.
For 4 months I was activated for state active duty for the national guard. We would travel all over the state and test nursing home and assisted living facilities staff and residence for covid-19. I quickly learned there are care facilities and facilities that care. I think it's clear this is the later.
Not what I expected when I googled granny gets wet.
Awesome! Great idea! The joy in that lady’s face is immeasurable!
I need sound!
Her smile at the end!❤️
Can you imagine being an age, where you think you'll never do something again and then you get to do it one more time? The joy that such a simple thing can bring to someone's soul is just amazing.
The old folks home’s Cool Runnings reboot is shaping up
*has heart attak
If I were to go, this is the way
This assisted awesomeness facility!
My 90 year old grandma used to ride in my uncles bicycle trailer, and she loved it. She was a tiny woman who had many adventures. I miss her dearly.
"I said NO you asshooooooIiiiiiiiiiIIIII I love this!, Thank you sonny!"
I see an easy insurance scam for a smart resident here, but I'm also a terrible person
Has Joan Lunden heard of this place....I would want to live there!!!
"y'ever take it off any sweet jumps?"
At least she getting something good for the $7-8,000/month.
This is awesome!
The absolute joy she's having!
OmG I love these people!
Omg why aren’t they wearing masks?!?!
This is so awesome but no way a hospital administrator is going to approve this. Injury/lawsuit waiting to happen
I mixed up the title with "Assisted Suicide", which made for a rather horrifying mental picture...
This makes my heart happy!
If her bladder is like mine she’s thinking “quit with the hose I have to pee”.
What a great job,the staff  there are true professionals who walk the walk of true caring! well done all!!
Genius!!
This is one of the best things I’ve ever seen!
Good work. 👏🌟👍
How gorgeous. 💗🥰
I thought I was in /r/whatcouldgowrong for a second
The joy on her face is so heartwarming 💕
can I ... can i move in?
This is Why we need to pay these people well, such important jobs that we will all (most likely) need at some point
Isn't putting "old people" enjoying things in r/aww sort of demeaning and infantilizing?
Love that she’s slip sliding in a full grandma outfit, including nylons.
As wholesome as this is, it makes me love it even more the fact that they took some safety precautions. Grandma is tied in. Two people at the sides pulling at approximately the same speed. Back person for stability. Lubrication and brake person up front.

You humans did good.
We need more people like this !
Personally, I find elderly people as cute as puppies. They're sweet, full of experience and often have amazing stories to tell. Employees at assisted living homes should enjoy their job, and treat these gems with respect and give them a good time.
This is something my grandmother would have loved if she was still here. She passed away a few weeks ago, and I miss her now more than ever. She always loved to do something fun, and I was really close to her and her sister when she was alive. My grandmother always believed in living a life full of fun and youthfulness even when you’re 90. It’s been hard without her here.
This is either precovid or she dead
That's adorable
She had to have her hip replaced after this.
Thanks for sharing that was great
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day !
My grandma would love this!
I’m so happy watching this
So joyful!
Very awesome
I hope I never lose that childlike joy
This is the best thing that I have seen all year
That’s really sweet of them for that
Awww this is wonderful to see.
Her smile :)
Well... isn't that just a delight.
Between this and Covid, there's going to be a lot of vacancies.  

*hit me with your downvotes!*
I miss my grandpa. He would have taken off his shirt and just belly flopped right on, heart problems be damned.
Oh this is absolutely wonderful.  I was in a really angry mood and this put a huge smile on my face.

What a great idea. What lovely people.  ❤️
This seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen
And this, your Honor, is why my client's mother is in a coma!
Oh my gosh, I work at an assisted living facility and my residents would LOVE this.
Why there is no caring elderly home in my country... always makes me sad
My black ice heart has completely melted ....... wow
Your never to old for a slip and slide!
That smile is priceless!
That smile!
I can hear lawsuits coming
It’s all fun and games until grandma flies off into the distance
I’m sure that facility’s risk management department had a field day with this one... I’ll see myself out
Slip n slide can easily turn into a slip n fall
I need to hear this lady laugh... but I also cried because my mommy dies of Covid May 31st and I never got the change to do this with her 😭
"Wasn't that fun?! "
"Please let me die already"
Honestly, I live for this. This is why I became a nurse. ❤️
You all must have a different version of slip n slides.....
Looks like the ones we used to make down in my part of Texas. Trash bags is what we would use. I begged my parents for a real slip and slide and never got one. The joy on the lady's face is just so darn cute. I can only hope to be as happy when I get to that age.
Uh Oh! Looks like Mildred requires a new diaper. Now that’s what I call a slip n’ slide.
I guess maybe I should have kids so I’m this happy when I’m old
The hapinnes
“I shit ‘em.”
Fabulous!
Oldies but goodies
Hehehehehe to adorable.
The sweetest thing I seen
If anyone is looking for a video, I found this one:  [https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/video/senior-citizens-slip-slide-summer-viral-video-64002259](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/video/senior-citizens-slip-slide-summer-viral-video-64002259)
r/mademesmile 

Adrenaline isn’t just for the young!
....add a ramp
Fuck yeah!
Hahaha!!! Ooooo!!! That’s adorable. (In a weird way considering my age).
Grandma’s gonna lose her jello!!
Take careee Grandmaaaa !!!!
Look at that UE strengthening and trunk control
Granny having more fun than me this summer
Woooow
Forbidden coffin dance
It’s all fun and games til someone breaks a pelvis
Grandma: That was so fun, it got my heart racing.
Grim Reaper: Hello
Grandma: Oh shit now I’m racing
i thought i read assisted suicide.
Why does this make me miss my mom?...
I so wanna join in with them, smile on her face priceless
Aaaaww she looks so happy!
Can't be NY cause the mayor killed most of them.
مىنءننى
Damn a little faster and she’s gonna end up like that biker guy in the opening scene of deadpool.
Who's on diaper duty ?
This is the sweetest thing ever ❤️❤️
Way to pull a Patch Adams ♥️
A liability? What’s that?
Sit and slide
She looks so scared.
Best use of gait belts ever
Time to show my activities director this! He’ll get a kick out of it.
This must be an older recording huh
So college kids are condemned for this shit, but when grandma does its awww???
Fucking Aye! My dad would have loved this.....  .  .
She was terrified until it was over. Then, for a
moment, she was a kid again.
My heart is melting! I read assisted living and slip'n'slide and was really concerned, but it looks like they're doing it safely.
I am a carer and at work right now. I am so showing this to my coworkers
I think we forget how good joy and laughing is for our overall health. The risk is honestly worth it. One of the greatest things you can do for an older person is make them forget they are old for a few minutes and remind them of their childhood.
Oh gosh, this made me so flipping happy.
This is so wholesome! 😍
Oh man those gait belts really got to me 😂 if ure in rehab you’d get it
Where can I sign up for the waitlist
I love this video. People forget that every amazing, happy, fun person who ever lived eventually will turn old, and that person doesn’t just disappear, they just lose abilities. They get treated like inconveniences and liabilities; they should be treated as treasures and I’m always so glad when I see stuff like this.
100% not in USA
This makes me miss my grandma so much!
My Dad helps run an assisted living facility and they are always trying to get the residents into more extreme activities. More recently (like this year, before covid), they all went scuba diving and made Go-Karts, but a few years ago they made local news when the owner pulled some strings to get the residents into some flight lessons.
Safe!
It's alll fun and games until someone breaks a hip
To me at 28 that run looks lame af but thats probably the fastest she has moved in a long time. Has to be exilerating for her, love to see such joy.
Had my mom-in-law do this at her SNF at last year’s summer festival.  It was amazing to see everyone’s absolute joy!!!
that is awesome. good for them.
My heart
And then they got Covid and died happy!!
Is this why it takes so long to answer the nurse call button?!
thats just asking for a heartattack
Trying to empty some beds. Can’t pull the old COVID cuomo move no mo
Lmao
Faith in humanity temporarily restored!
AKA The Hipcracker
Nice
*sorry. Never too late to be correct
loose
Hopefully not recently considering the pandemic, but still great nonetheless
External disaster at nursing home

Twelve ?NOFs
This just warms my cold dead heart!
This is down the road from where I live👍✌️♥️
That's so sweet
Oh my God if this is not the sweetest, most adorable thing I’ve ever seen!!!
I think it’s great, but what was this waiver situation like?  If Gladys has a heart attack/stroke on the slip n slide...what then?  Did the family have to agree to let granny slide?

Regardless, pretty awesome.
Care homes who actually care
Now this is the kind of motivation I need to get in shape. If only I could sign up to be the slip n slide runner
I thought this was r/watchpeopledieinside and was waiting for something less wholesome. The lack of surprise warmed my heart. Thank you for this
Omggg her smile I love this sm
Good idea but i would never put my own grandma on that shit.  She can easily get hip fracture
I hope they all die
I’m so down for this!
White excellence
this makes me believe that there is still humanity in the world
I will also make my grandma happy as long as she is alive
Recreatipn Therapy is a beautiful thing
My grandma would absolutely love this!
Everyone liked that
I work in a facility that cares for developmentally and intellectually disabled people and they do this a lot too. They love it. A lot of them aren't able to go out into the community and things like this make their entire weeks.
That is scary as shit. Omg.
r/humansbeingbros
"How'd you like it Edith?"

"It was amazing, now which one of you is changing my depends?"
Ahhh me heart it’s achen now
Finally, some good fucking assisted care facility employees.
She still broke both hips
Grandma is so happy to get to be outside
Why don't we do funerals like this?
That’s awesome you’re never too old to have fun
That is so BOSS!!
This is so amazing!!
These are some wonderful and caring staff
I can't imagine being that fragile... But someday, I will. And that sucks
They probably had to change her depends but definitely worth it:)
Those pants definitely went few shades darker by the end.
Brought to you by hiptastic. Finest replacement hips in da biz
W
"That was almost as fast as the years flashing by."
Jesus the feels... I never even went on a slip and slide, and I'm sure these old folks hadn't done so either! What a wonderful thing.
I'm so glad this on r/aww and not r/whatcouldgowrong
It’s all fun and games until someone breaks a hip.
All fun and games til granny faceplants..
I love this...so much!
Aged care done right 👌
And now she has covid
This is beyond wholesome! Amazing people being bros.
Holy fuck am I ever happy watching this!!
You go back to where you once were, everything you left behind while growing up returns when growing old.
Reposted to shit.
If that was my grandma I’d be in there slapping the shit out of people
If this ain’t me at my nursing home get me out quick!
I miss my grandmas
That smile at the end says it all :D
Love your grandparents before they turn into an urn.
Her face, that joy! Omg so awesome!
Was i the only one who thought he slashed the duck
That’s so sweet!
This is old
So so lovely. I hope that everyone experienced joy.
“This is m307, coming in code three for a trauma. I have an 87 yof with a left sided flail chest and a possible left upper arm fracture and left flank bruising. Patient is on warfarin. Patient is coming from assisted living. Patient was on what appears to be an inflatable rubber ducky and the staff was dragging the patient down a slip n slide at a low speed when the patient rolled off the duck. Vitals as follow HR 128, BP 88/50 SPO2 96% 15 lpm. ETA 8 minutes”
Nanna's going out the same way she came into this world.
Why do i feel like they’re just trying to give these ppl heart attacks?
I’m sure granny hasn’t been that wet in years!
this is what i want my funeral to look like
Omg I love this!!! ❤️❤️❤️
That’s a fall waiting to happen
That looks like an insurance nightmare.
Humanity. Refreshing.
Nice
He’s a thob, worn by gulf Arabs.
repostareeno
everyone deserves to have fun
So fun!
Befor or after pandemic?
It's all fun and games until granny takes a tumble and breaks a a handful of bones. Imagine having to write that report, yikes.
my nursing senses tell me an incident report is waiting to be filled out LOL
Then she had a heart attack and died.
And here I am at a nursing home with 32 residents all to myself
I love this!
This is so beautiful!
That's so freaking sweet!
Loving your idea. Thank you for making other people happy :)
Omg tryna give grannie a heart attack LMAO
grandma must be “ again,again,again”
Hope they aren't doing this at a Pennsylvania Assisted Living
r/wcgw
Jesus, I hope I'm dead before I get to that point.
No  I do not hate I just express my Gdamn feelings. No has to agree w/ what I feel damn .
sounds like alot of liability
This is great. I would love to sit down and hear her life’s story. We will all be elderly one day and we all have our own, unique story.
This seems like an accident waiting to happen
This is AMAZZING!!!
Turns out the people that set it up realized too late that they spread COVID19 to this nursing home. They knew the residents were doomed, but decided to give them some joy before their final departure. Notice how they don't wear masks to raise alarm.
Her smile is Showing how much she Enjoyed that experience !!
You want happy old people because this is how you get happy old people!
yo law dept is at an offsite, lets do some super liable shit!!!!!
I was worried about her until I saw the laughter at the end
This is what life's about
I freaking love this so much!!
Reminds me of Patch Adam's and the pool of noodles.
How grandma broke her hip...
This is wholesome af
I wouldn’t trust those young whipper snappers. Now, get off my lawn!
That woman looks terrified.
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS!!!! They are just BIG kids at the heart💜
It's all fun and games until grandma breaks a hip.

>Mortality was 2% for patients younger than 70 years and more than 27% for those aged 90 years or older. In a study of 612 patients, Aharonoff found that an age >85 years was predictive of 1-year mortality.

Almost gave em a heartattack

EDIT: ME

EDIT 2: JK, them
I Hope her Smiles will never end ... Everyone love ur elders Please they need our Love!
I wish this had audio! I would love to hear her laugh!
Big pp right there
👏👏👏
If I lived there, I'd pay the staff $10,000 to let me launch myself head first down the slide. If I died as a result it'd be a bonus. (not casting any aspersions on the residents who live there, just saying I'd personally prefer living on the edge rather than just trying to make to another day).
She looks terrified
Assisted suicide facility, you say?

Looks like fun!
That's adorable.
🥺💖💖💖
That's epic
Aww, so adorable. It looks like she’s having so much fun :)
I love that she’s still wearing her stockings!
Woo! I need the name of this please, because I need to go there when I’m old.
GET IT NANA!
r/nursing
So wholesome!
I need sound
Someone please send her off to Bag Raiders (in a nice way).
That is by far....the most amazing thing I've seen.  Way to go to everyone involved!
Checked to see if it was on WCGW
Reminds me of that Dr Who episode where the elderly people got to be kids again. I love it
I love people who care
That’s a depressingly short slip n slide lol
Oh great. Meanwhile my mother had to write several politicians and get interviewed by the local news before the nursing home allowed her to see her father through a window for five minutes one time in the last 5 months.
I mean sure , old Gertrude is laying in the pool of her own vomit and feces but the facility will post this video and people will be like wow, my grandma will be really well taken care of here.
Upvoted because it’s wholesome and it reminded me of my Mima (STAY AWAY CREED)
Omg my heart❤️ her face of joy and excitement 😭❤️
I miss the before times.
I could hear her laughter!
Reminds me of the arc of life. She’s experiencing this with the same level of fear and excitement as a toddler. Life is amazing!
That’s beautiful!!
Lawsuit waiting to happen
That’s just wholesome as heck
I had the split second assumption for some reason that participation was mandatory, and being worried about how terrified she was
I’m jealous
[everyone liked that]
"I can't remember the last time I moved that fast"
Screams in fear as she has another episode...I'm having so much fun arghhh
That’s nice
What a fucking terrible idea.
I work at an assisted living facility. We did this last summer also! My residents rode on an inflatable chicken 😂
I feel a lawsuit coming.. but they are so happy
Most fun way to break a hip.
I wish there was sound!
We really gonna guild a bot like this?
It's the simple things
Everybody hop on the slip n' sue!
You just took up landscaping! Who else’s fingers hurt!
Her joy makes my heart sing. ♥️
I hope this is the only type of “slipping” they’ll allow
This is cute and all but I see some sick memes coming out of this video lol
r/humansbeingbros already been crossed?
This is pretty cool.
That rush must’ve reduced her life expectancy by like a day...
This is the best... Well done
I’m crying.
Thankful for the wonderful staff who took the time to come up with this. Keep safe, all! :)
Way to die happy
Bet grandma wants to go faster
“Nurse! I’ve made pudding”
That's beautiful! Wish my Mum's home would've done something like this!
This is wholesome.
This is my favorite thing in the world. 2020 isn't *complete* crap, thank you!
This smile on her face at the end😭
I absolutely LOOOOOVE THIS!! Everyone needs some fun and a good laugh. We are NEVER too old for these things. I appreciate the staff of this facility keeping them 'young at heart'.
 That smile is everything
They're secretly trying to perform assisted suicide but circumvent the law as an accident. :))
ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ
I thought it said assisted suislide for a little too long
She look terrified
This video proves that the age is just a number
No mask. Super vulnerable person... Cool.
I can’t stop watching this!
More like break a hip n slide
That was the look of pure joy at the end. Precious old people.
I like how the gal at the end is clearly saying clear, it works for both safety and fun.
We did this at my school for kids with special needs  last summer 😍
Please god don’t do this shit to me when I’m old.
Gimme some oxy and put Seinfeld on.
My 94 year old mom would do that in a heartbeat!
As cute and fun as this is.. it seems incredibly risky
I work for a school for kids with special needs and we did this!! 😍😍
As a nurse in an assisted living facility.  HELL YES!  I would love to see them do this for my residents.
Who doesn’t love a slip ‘n slide??
That smile at the end got me!!! ❤️❤️❤️
Workers at an assisted living facility don't understand hippa.
This is incredible.
You guys sure are loving this video where a poor old lady dies right after. 

I’m not a doctor but I’m on reddit all the time and she lost her shoes. RIP
Fuck this shit...the same person gets to enjoy it time and time again....when my chance?
Hey Jennifer Slowpez, get out of dodge.
Every now and again you see someone who you WISH was your friend. 

Everyone in this video.
My heart 
AAAAAA
No bikini?
I love it
I just got a job at an assisted living place and I'm definitely doing this
So awesome this staff takes the time to give them some fun livin!
This is the best thing I’ve seen in a long time.  Thank you!
Terrified then thrilled. Awesome!
The best!! ❤
:’)
That looks like alot of fun!
great
Some people just really love other people. That seems like the thing to do.
I thought this was 'Jackass' flying grandma in the air
Oh my God, she looks so happy ahicannottakeitanymoreiamdyingfromsweetnes<3
*has a heart attack*
That is so cool they did that for those residents! I'll bet they enjoyed it immensely. Thanks so much for sharing!
Senor Loadenstein. Porque es muy rapido
she didn't look that happy during it lol
I wanna live here when I’m old
Seems like a good euthanasia project for the ones heading out the door
This warmed my heart. Thank you.
Must be pre covid. I haven't seen my mom since February. It's awful.
The urge to launch grandma into the next zip code must be overwhelming.
Patch Adams would be proud lol
This made me uncomfortable.
If I ever have to be in an assisted living facility I hope it is a fun one, but on my budget, probably not.
Wholesome 🥺
Rock on Grandma!!
I caught grandma digging the ride once or twice.  Good for her.
"i think i'm having a heart attack!!"
Yaaa
Me and my sisters do this, but it always ends up e someone getting hurt
So good to see this. The little joys can make such a different to these old folks
r/adorableoldpeople
Yes yes plz spread the joy
I love this so much!!!!
I’m not trying to be a Karen but where are everyone’s masks?
This both made me happy and somehow sad.
I would be terrified of this idea if I worked there. For a minute, I thought that lady was going to have a heart attack.
Such wholesome. *heart attack*
I love this, as an emt who works with so many elderly patients this really makes me cry. Like hard thick tears of joy. I’m so happy. I’m so sad. I’m so alive.
Miss you gramma
Fuck yeah granny, get some!
All fun and games until grandma breaks her hip
youre gonna give one of them a heart attack or somethin
That's too much.
I wish this had audio to hear her laugh. This is awesome. We’re all kids inside, no matter how old we are.
That is so many awards in one post.
Deja vu
The residents of my gf's facility aren't allowed outside currently
Shes so happpyyyy
We need this kind of joy in the world right now!
Then I’m mad as fuck when my grandma breaks a hip
The grandma is traumatised
Old people are the best.
Where's the blooper reel?
That’s actually such a good idea, but it’s not social distancing
What an absolutely wonderful thing to do for those people!
People in the back are all obese. I love people.
If Reddid updates are any indication, I'm deeply encouraged by the creativity, boldetry and swagger. I keep geeting older than the young-dumb folks. WHO offend nobody  Just....savin the globe n shit.
Stuff like this is intensely moving. thank you for sharing. and to the old folks. for sharing.
/u/redditspeedbot 8.0x
It's all fun and games till someone loses a hip (breaks)and poor Carol loses her  nickname for the day ,good ol' slip n slide . But Wendy will have a reason for the broken hip instead of being the resident bike (anyone can go for a ride)
Hope they're risk assessed!
Goddammit if I ever get to this point I’m making my husband promise to put a bullet through my head.
I will never not like this !!
Wholesome
People make so much of a difference in care. My folks have carers pop by their house to help out with stuff. 

Before, they used to dread them coming, but we've changed suppliers and the difference has been amazing.

They look forward to them coming and talk to me about them. I've met a few of the team and they lovely people who actually care about what they do. 

It's brought me such peace of mind that while I'm working, I know my parents have nice people looking out for them.

Good carers are worth their weight in gold and need much more recognition/pay.
That's just amazing
I’m guessing it was as much fun for the staff as the residents.
Sorry Tommy but I pooped em.
Wait until it flies off
That’s awesome.
Cleanup on the yellow turtle please!!
Big smiles! She looks so happy \^\_\^
She is happy, I like she is happy
This made me happy.
Go grandma
What a great staff!
Are those dumbbells holding it to the ground?
Omg this is the best!
Edit: a word
I’m just imagining the meeting that this idea came up in. 

“Alright hear me out, what this nursing home needs is a slip’n’slide”
I was freaking out until I saw her smile
That scene from Cocoon.
*everyone liked that*
Love it
Well when she has a heart attack that's the best way to go. Slip and slide into the ⚰️
How did my grandma break her hip?

Launched off a slip and slide? 

What are you doing in this place? Get her prune juice and Matlock!
I love this more than I can express!
Frinkin' awesome! Well played staff! 😃👍
👏👏👏
Shut up I'm not crying it's just dust
All the feels! 

Whos cutting onions?
As a x-ray tech I can see the list of scans I'll have to do lol

Glad they were having fun :) I'm happy to see those kind of caretakers!
The lawyer in me is thinking of the massive liability risk.

The actuary in me is thinking of the facility insurance rates.
I want to see this kind of stuff in the media.  I want the news to be taken over by grannies on a slip and slide. This is the coverage we need right now.
She looks miserable
She probably has a move that fast in years. But so happy to see them smile
I've never wished for audio so badly in my life. That laugh must be incredible.
It’s refreshing to see such a caring, involved staff at such a facility!  I’ll have to be sure and tell my kids to look this one up if it ever comes to that for me!
She hasn't experience that much adrenaline since 1969.
I am 60 and I am looking forward to being a old lady. Not because I want to be physically old. Nope. I know old ladies get away with saying shit I never could say in my youngers days. My parents were incredibly old fashioned and now I can take the filters off and say whatever the hell I want to.
Damn, a multi-repost with 100k+ upvotes hitting the front page.  Incredible
Adorable
Love that smile at the very end! 😁
sd
Fun moments of life!
I saved this post to give it an award when I could. Today, I gave the award. Thank you for sharing this wholesomeness.
These staff members are angels. 😇
Reddit: Approves lack of masks in any social setting as long as it's viewed positively 

Also Reddit: Fuck these science denying mother fucking Karens for not wearing a mask
Omg.  She looks exactly like my gram... who died 2.5 years ago.  Freaky.
...this is fun, but I hope this video predates covid?
Meanwhile, my mom's at an assisted living facility and she got back from an emergency hospital visit to a $3000 rent increase. Oh, and the free internet is no longer included
Video of the week contender
I wonder if you get to that age everything is fazter because you are slower
Aww is damn right
Medic 132 priority 2 falls and a assisted facility, staff advising 3 pts. Request additional at scene. 


This is dangerous af


Sweet downvotes. Yes senior citizens can have SAFE FUN but most of them have arthritis, osteoporosis,calcium deficiencies, weak joints. Did you also know anyone over the age of 60 has a 80% mortality rate for hip and femur surgery? Did you also know a normal ground level fall is enough to break a seniors hip in 4 places and they'll never walk again and will prob die withen 4 years? 
Sure launch them down a fucking hill tho

This must be pre COVID 19 as there are no masks concerning such a high risk population
Not a mask among them. Guess it'll be their last joyride.
It's all fun and games until she shits herself and has a heart attack at the same time
Crying
There should be a sub for this! Maybe /r/grandmasgonewild ?

I hope they loved this as much as I loved this.
