 My thoughts... to your thoughts. My mind... to your mind
You should frame this, OP. That's mantle material.
Thanks for the smile! This is beautiful. 
My son and my cat had this bond too. The day we euthanized my cat, cancer sucks, my cat head butted my son. Just like this. It brings back so many emotions. God I miss that cat. He was the sweetest soul. He loved my son, so much.  RIP Nate. You were my best friend. 
"The old male human is useless. I'm your father meow."
I caught my 28 year old boyfriend and our cat doing this the other day... not as cute as this!
God I love cats. 
Nose to nose and forehead to forehead are a big deal to cats.

Cat looks like it‚Äôs about to get a right hook
If there were one thing we could call honor/affection/loyalty/family, it is a concept shared by many species. Maybe it's love. We are so fortunate not to be alone in this universe.
The contract is sealed
Both are planning a planet invasion.

Feline mind meld. 
A moment captured in time. Beautiful 
Your cat has just crowned your son an honorable member of the family. That's why they do head boops.
Cats like, dude as long as I'm here, I got your back. Goin' down swingin'.
My cat (an orange tabby) used to head butt me as a show of affection all the time. Had him for 16 beautiful years. This picture filled my heart with so much love. 
Props for saying "one and a half year old" rather than "18 months".
TELL ME THEY'RE NAMED CALVIN AND HOBBES. PLEASE.
If the cat does that enough, your 1.5 year old might start head-bonking other people to show affection.  Seen it happen with one of my friends' kids.
They pledged to be best friends furrever at that very moment.
How perfectly sweet! 
If you zoom in on your sons face he look super pissed lol

Cant decide if that makes it cuter or not
Cat : ‚ÄúMmmmm I love you‚Äù

Baby: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôre we doin‚Äô here with this head thing?‚Äù 
id say they were in a meeting to take the house and take out the dog by force

It was then that your cat mind melded your son into a cat person. Lucky. Didn't happen to me until I was 30.
Remember me human, for I am not long for this world.
I eat you last, little servant.
You fool! Your cat is transfering its consciousness into your child in order to prolong its life and ensure world domination!
We breakin out of here?
Cats don't play baseball, but this is called bunting
Same way I usually say bye to my dog when I leave for work.  Granted, he's usually asleep, but he wakes enough to give a happy sigh and maybe a nose boop.
"Take care of our parents for me."
My 1.5 year old has these moments with my 9 year old cats all the time. They knew I was pregnant before I knew and were so excited for a kitten. It's a weird battle to keep them out of the nursery at night (sometimes I fail and one sleeps in there all night).

Thanks to affectionate cat head buts, my son now head buts everyone he loves. Me, my husband, random kids at daycare, my concrete-headed dog...
the cat is switching minds with the boy to gain youth

"The exchange is complete.  My soul is in the child!"
What bothers me about his picture is the fact our dogs and cats know the vulnerable position of young children and treat them accordingly, How on earth can actual adult humans not get this and abuse/neglect their  kids. 
The cat is spreading its scent. They have scent glands on their heads. They do this to spread their scent on loved ones to warn others to stay away. "This is my human, I love this human, don't hurt my human"

A cat doing this means a lot more than it looks
Thank you for saying 1.5yr old instead of 18month old 
I feel like cats understand trust, and who is valuable to their people (e.g. their "owners). 
Aw why is the kitty apologizing?
Head boops are my favorite. 
This is a really nice photo. I dig the composition.
OMG I just love love your cat.
Animals are such divine gifts...as are children. So much right in this moment.
Made my fricken day. How cute is that!?!!!
Thank you for measuring your son‚Äôs age in years and not months. 
Upvote for the kitty.
When I was 3 my cat used to pounce on me from beneath the coffee table whenever I toddled by. Luckily she was de-clawed.

[removed]
It‚Äôs crazy to think that at one point in time, we were all as big as or smaller than a cat
What a wierd feeling it must be, being an old cat or dog, looking at a baby human.
Your cat can draw very well
 "My mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts," 
Stop! My heart can only swell so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your son has awesome toys. 
I thought your son had a tiny knife for a second. I was concerned. Lol
Aaaand now I have that damned piggy bank song stuck in my head. My kid had the same one until a few months ago after the post-Christmas purge. God I hated that thing.

But tonks/bonks are ways a cat shows affection. This is adorable.
CUTENESSüòç how beautiful 
Fight night! There can be only one on THIS turf!
Looks like a standard knowledge transfer to me. 
Be still my heart! So sweet! 
My immediate thought was that this was a Charles Lee Ray, Childs Play, kind of thing.

Matching orange hair.
God damnit. Ice melting. Heart beating. Aaargh.
Don't even give a fuck if this gets buried. I just had the best night of my life and this is beautiful. 
I hope you frame and hang this. 
Thanks for using years and not months to age your child. 
Thank you for saying 1.5 instead of eighteen months
looks like he wants to win and she wants to cuddle
I appreciate that you said 1.5 years over 18 months. 
The head-bunk--one of the best interactions between human and cat
He just transferred all of the knowledge in the universe to your son!
Once the cat offers the forehead then you knows it's real.
The reason I can tell the OP is a guy is because he didn't say 'My 17 month old son...'
My heart just melted
That's really adorable!
Toxoplasmosis. 
Ok, ok.
I took back my downvote.
Dammit.
So if a baby is 1.5, is it a year and five months or a year and six months?
Nice. But it looks like the kid is seconds away from punching the cat in the mouth. I wonder what happened next u/mgrave22
This pic is so amazing. I have a cat. She is the most strong love that I EVER feel to anyone in my life. My mom doesn't count. My dad does. I love my cat more than I love my dad. She's the sweetest soul in the world. And she does the same thing to me daily. She's‚Äã amazing and a REAL lady. Imagine her living 14 years with me it's a dream. You are a lucky person. Long life to him :)

Cat: In my fourteen years of living, I have gathered quite an insurmountable amount of knowledge. Now I shall pass these thoughts into you, my young Master. My time shall come soon. 

Baby: *Nyaninyananyaaaa*

In David Attenborough's voice: "And here we see the domesticated feline assessing the size and relative strength of an infant human. Never quite divorced of the built in biological desire to murder and consume soft flesh, the modern house cat is as much an adorable pet as it is a lion in your home, waiting to take down its own version of a wildebeest."
"love you hooman"
*head bump*
Its probably somewhere in the twenty thousand comments but this is your cat accepting your child. Head rub is a way of imparting his scent and claiming ownership to his fam.

That cat is his guardian. It‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs so old. But at least they can enjoy each other now. 
They are plotting for sure. Keep one eye open when you sleep from now on OP. 
/r/accidentalrenaissance 
My daughter had this exact same moment with our cat about 13 years ago at that same age.  Then our cat swiped her face completely at random and cut her cheek.  She still has the little white line there today.  


Den dey fuse
Thanks for not saying 18 month old 
I like how you said 1.5 years old instead of those parents who say, "Oh yeah, my son is 29.4 months old."
Thank you for not abandoning your cat the moment you had a child. Most douchbags parents do.
The cat then proceeded to push the baby off the counter with his paw
Is there an AWW subreddit without children?
Aww so sweet! My daughter JUST turned 1.5 today. She's going through an affectionate streak lately and comes up to me frequently throughout the day to give me hugs. Melts my heart.
I hope to do this one day

Cat is 9 times as old as your son. Cats live 9 lives. Your son is your cat's final form. I used math so it's for sure true.

Oh my, my heart is smiling!
Nothing more beautiful than the love of a small kid and their pet.
Very sweet.
Took me 2 years and some change for him to run his face on my face. I mean...I did this constantly to him and he's back away...then finally one night jumps on my chest and I stick my nose out he sniffs and at the same time smash our faces into each other...been tight ever since

True love.
Well that kid now has a life long guardian that will fuck up anyone that isn't him.
Amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è

That's how they transfered thoughts. 
the cat looks like a mother right now. like that's what mom's do in movies where they put their forehead against their child and say, "be safe and take care of yourself at aunties. mommy's going away for a while." >!proceeds to get hung!<damn that was dark.

My fianc√© and I do this thing that we call ‚Äúcat head bump‚Äù because I fucking love when cats are feeling cuddly and push their head firmly into your body‚Äîit makes me so happy. and so now when one of us wants a cat head bump, we extend our head out and wait for the other to reciprocate. Long story short I got really excited to see this and showed him because this is the truest of cat head bumps!!
Head boops for all!
cutest shit i ever seen
Can anyone comment on the pad he's sitting on?  I'm looking to get some for my kid, but I'm unclear for what I should be looking for.

This cat looks just like my Tigger. He passed away 2 years ago at almost 15. He and my daughter greeted each other like this every day. I miss that judgy, demanding, chubby old guy every day. Give your cat a hug from me.

Cats , especially male cats head boop as a a display of affection. My fiancee had a very muscular and rough tomcat who was never showing any feline display of affection like rubbing on people, except booping when he wanted to be petted. Booping is kind of an understatement, headbutt was a more accurate definition in this case.
Quite lucky to capture this on camera. I'd say you glued their heads together!

My late kitty - who passed last November - would have been 19 now. She hated everyone but me. Except for when I had a baby. It‚Äôs like she somehow knew that baby was an extension of me and would come around and let my daughter grab her tail, ‚Äúpet‚Äù her and lie on her belly as if she were a furry pillow. On my kitty‚Äôs last day, the vet who came to usher her to the rainbow bridge, told me that she has seen kitties hang on thru sickness and old age because of their people. It was clear to me that‚Äôs exactly what my kitty did. We miss you, Zoey. 
Few things are better than a kitty head boop. 

My cat always headbutt me, every morning when I wake up she climb on a chair and look at me until I lean in. I don't know why she does that but it's really cute.

My nephew, now six, has a cat like that.  It even looks like that - an orange tabby.  That cat worships the ground that crazy kid walks on and can never be separated from him for more than a minute. They got him when the kid was a little bit older, though - about three.

I had a cat that looked and acted just like this. His name was Milo and he was older than me. He used to lay in my crib to make sure I was safe and would be around my toys and blankets when I was at school and would comfort me whenever I would seem sad or cry. He managed to live to around 17 or 18 years until we had to put him down. He was the sweetest cat I‚Äôve ever had and I‚Äôll never forget about how amazing he was. Love you, Milo.

Omg I'm so sorry to tell you this but a pedophile shared this pic on Twitter!! Not kidding, he's admits it like he's proud. Came across his profile because someone I know on there was posting and yelling at him for how disgusting he is. I saw this pic on his feed and followed the link bc I thought this was his kid and that he needed to be reported to police. But anyways, his user name is @ zach10091. Really again, so sorry to be having to tell this, but I'm a mom and would want to know if someone was sick was sharing my son's photo. Hope you see this

My cat is 5 months and is actually bigger than your cat. I‚Äôm starting to get worried
Awwww! I have a 10 month old son and 9 year orange tabby so I have a similar scene in mi casa üíô
According to "how to speak cat" this means I love you
Children can really benefit from having a loving creature beside them while driving up. Beautiful moment and beautiful picture. 
With this I transfer all my power to you

Passing on years of wisdom and assholery. Get ready for your son to turn into a real douchebag.
I cant stop crying


Edit: I've learned you cannot have feelings here. 
And now he has toxoplasmosis. But so does every other human in the world so he prolly be fine.
Woah a person who understands a pet isnt their child! Updoot!
Props on putting 1.5 yrs not "our 18 month old" like..   after 12 complete months we move to years .... Example "oh our baby of 24 months is such a....." Stupid small thing but come on people! BTW love this pic üòá
Gingers talking.
Aww
Awesome moment. You may frame this photo. 
Awwww man :‚Äô)
Your cat has just transferred to your son. If your son starts licking his toes repeatedly you‚Äôll know 
There can only be one
Time to combine!
After this moment cat slapped him a few times across the face.
Yah, I‚Äôm gonna have to take offense.  Cute moment and all, but this kind of blatant disrespect cannot go unchecked.  Too many parents suffered.  Too many kids were disappointed.  In your attempt to post a wholesome image, my friend, you have offended.  Read just yourself and your paycheck will reflect.

The cat is actually transferring part of his soul into your child's body so that your child will become his phylactery
‚ÄúListen to me, human child: As we grow older, I will teach you how to be good, gentle and most of all, how to protect your family as I have these many years.‚Äù
Right before that bastard cat, completely unprovoked, batters the fuck outta the the poor kid
I see the joke went right over your head 
Nice, but Whatever you‚Äôre feeding to the cat, you need to be feeding to the kid instead. Or is that just the perspective of the picture? 
Boooooooooorrrriiinnnggg
My son isn‚Äôt even 1 yet and has more hair than that.
