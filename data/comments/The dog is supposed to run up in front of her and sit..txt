Don't know how the owner managed not to laugh during the zoomies.Point A - ZOOMIES - Point B*I added a step, see if you can notice the difference*Aw man, this needs sound.Well …he did sit.*The Ministry of Silly Walks approves**I DID GOOD I DID GOOD I DID SO GOOD I WAITED AND SAT UNTIL YOU CALLED ME AND THEN I CAME TO YOU I DID SO....*

Sees her face

*Oh. I forgot the last part.*I used to compete in Schutzhund nationally and help train people to train their dogs.

Whoever taught her how to train her dog did an excellent job. None of it is forced, the dog is willingly complying. 

I'm not sure if this is a mock trial, some other obedience event, or an official Schutzhund B event, but further stages are age-restricted as the dogs mature. This would not be allowed in later trials but it shows that the dog has an eagerness to please and obey and that she is keeping training fun.Nothing wrong with a little personal flair. He did it way better than alllll the other pups. 💜Full marks!Typical boxer 😍 my girl is like bambi in a field lolNailed it.Those is just boxer tingsBrilliant. That's my kinda dog. Personality 100%Yeah but to be fair no one said it couldn’t do it with FLAIR! And Pizzazz!What are they training for?This is how I walk everywhere.  I see no problem here. 10/1017/10 for style!Human: "Step1 stay. Step2 run. Step43 sit."

Dog: "What about steps 3-42"

Human: "Improvise"*Any asshole dog can run up and sit, but can they do "THIS" Karen?*He did a good job, 10/10 good boy**50 points to Gryffindor**Boxers, essentially cocaine in Dog form.Boxer? Boxer.It's a boxer. Its operating as expected.Video with sound on youtube. Not sure if this was linked or not. 

https://youtu.be/p2YVMTbhZqcHe thought it was a dance recital and had some new moves to show off.My husband has been wanting a boxer for years and I've been saying no.  This changed my mind.  I need this kind of derp in my life 🤣Instruction unclear; become tornado?Sometimes enthusiasm gets control and I have to dance ! Very typical boxer move.Straight savage.+ 10 points for style.Can we get one with sound please?r/maliciouscomplianceAnd THIS is why I love boxers!! This doggo is the embodiment of the breed; they are the spazziest, lovable and loyal dog you will ever have! I have had 2 in my life. I lost my girl Izzy last year - she was my bff for 12 great years!! I miss her dearly. But I don't have the heart to have another - I will see her in heaven because that is where she is. :)Boxers are the funniest people...We have a winner.https://i.imgur.com/lbEWDZF.gifvI would be so proud if that was my doggoBoxers are the greatestWhat a great job from a great doggoExcellent style!Some dogs sit. Some sit with pizzazz.He is the goodest boy in the contest, I'm sureExtra points for style?No one said what the dog could or could not do during the run.  :)Well, he’s a boxer, soooo...Tries to squeeze in some quick zoomies hoping noone would noticeif the task is to simply *run up and sit*, how else would you differentiate yourself from the competition?Entertaining and obedient...what a good boiWould those be slammy whammies or zoomies? Or the hitherto unlabeled category, zoomy whammies?Boxers are high energy with goofy personalities.I his defense, he did all that. He just couldn't help throwing in a few whirly zooms on top of it. I give him 10/10 for originality.He tried running so fast that he looked like a giraffe on the startup.Perfect execution!Best In Show right there. Everyone else can go home.I feel kinda sorry for the lady, but the damn goofball is having a blast.Owner: "Come"

Doggo: "RODEOOOOO!"10/10Dedication 9000you left me there for a FULL HOUR! I'm so glad to be with you again.Nailed it.And he did exactly that. Perfect score.I love boxers.Boxers are the goofiest dogsSeems about right for a boxer...Flawless.That's a ~~Tigger~~ *Boxer*

You're lucky it didn't bounce up expecting her to catch it for love and snuggles. The fact it only spun around a few times and then actually sat is a damn miracle.He put his own spin on it.When you're a boxer and all those years of pent up urge to chase your tail despite having none finally become too much.His head couldn't keep up with that launch. It was like a cartoon. lolWhen I was taking a dog training class at one point we had to stand at the other side of the room from our pup and tell him to come. Some of the dogs ignored the command or wandered off, others actually made it across the room to their proud owners. My dog however bolted towards me at top speed; initially I was impressed he understood enough to head in my direction, especially with so many potential distractions along the way. As I'm standing there smiling, expecting to be one of the few that successfully completed the activity, my dog reaches me (he still hasn't slowed down at this point), and bolts right past and out the open door that was behind me. It only led into a stairwell but it cracked all of us up. I have no idea what he expected to find in there, but it's definitely one of my favourite moments from his training.It's like his head wasn't ready for all that acceleration.I mean, it *is* a boxer, so that was actually very restrained.You can practice everyday for months and take your dog to all the classes and this stuff still happens. Dog shows even host "fun matches" that are basically like practice shows for puppies to get experience and for people to practice obedience and agility in this type of setting, but when it comes down to it, dogs are gonna dog.
 
I went to my first obedience trial when I was probably 10 or 11 and saw a Bernese Mountain dog take off from his owner, jump out of his ring and into another ring because he saw another Bernese Mountain dog. He literally just wanted to visit.My Boxer has a nice control of her zoomies but when she has them holy crap. She's either jumping over something a car, couch, or a small child. Or she's pretending to be a greyhound mixed with a cheetah.Good boy!Think the dog gave himself whiplash.this should be on the never celebrate too early compilationsPure excitementDoggy jazz handsIm dead, that did the thing. It stopped me from breathing.“Miscalculated zoomies amount”All I see here is extra creditThe dog equivalent of doing a donut into a parallel parking spot. He just added some sweet ass styleI own a boxer. This is the best trained boxer ever.Had a boxer for years and she was the exact same way. LolNailed it!I expected no less from a boxer :>That is exactly what that dog did. She ran up and sat. She just did it in the most Boxer way possible./u/gifreversingbot

Mine is 11 and still plays with my other dogs like she is a puppy. Definitely not as agile as she once was and it's tough knowing she won't be here one day.He did it perfect!! Jsut a bit of th ol' razzle dazzle first.I could tell that was a boxer without even seeing its face.This is the epitome of a boxerThis is why I love boxers.So the doggie cyclone was great, but it's important not to miss when the dog's body took off so hard, it's head couldn't keep up and he gave himself whiplashThe juxtaposition of the referee's slow walk into her position to deeply analyze this dog, versus him simply not giving a single flying fuck about anything except becoming the world's best dog helicopter... it's too much.The dog did sit, and he made sure to throw in a little extra flair for bonus points!Pure Boxer, what did you expect?FlawlessBoxers gonna boxer! I think they do this just because they like feeling the single marble in their heads swirl around.He did dun up and sit in front of her,  he just did it with a little more PIZAZZ than expectedI DID IT I DID IT I DID IT! - dog probablyso my boxer is fine ...Dog.exe is experiencing issuesr/whatswrongwithyourdogit's almost a little sad they need to train that exuberance out of that pupAdded in camel spins for increased difficulty, 10/10bonus danceFucking boxers man...

It strikes me as a boxer thing to doPeak Boxer!360 No Sit, fuckin nailed itDidn’t know dogs came with a spin cycle!!Boxer in a nutshell.I love the acceleration, head thrown back, white of the eyes seen, one paw almost galloping in the air.11/10. great performance. you win the competition.as far as i can tell this Boxer was set to pause and then fast forward.Love boxer dogs, thanks for sharing!#NAILED ITBoxers man.I have a boxer too, they are all a bit crazy!You read the title, see the dog is a Boxer. Yep, this isn't going to go exactly to plan.Of course it had to be a boxer.Having done obedience, I would have loved to hear what the judge said to the owner at the end.
After judging robot obedience dogs all day, I am sure she enjoyed this dog's sheer joy on that recall. What a wonderful dog!100/10Can you give us a link with sound ... the *sauce*, if you will?

Until then, I guess 30% ceiling/sky and 30% ground is just something we will have to get used to.Seems like a perfectly normal boxer response to me.
