My cat does this to my belly too! But I‚Äôm a 39 year old man.
My cat did this to a friend. Until the baby kicked. Really really hard. After that the cat would sit on the back of the couch staring at my friend's belly suspiciously.
My wife just gave birth and my cats avoided her like she was infested with a xenomorph
One of the first noises your baby will hear is a cats purr! How sweet!!!
If this is your wife‚Äôs first baby, don‚Äôt be surprised if the cat starts acting VERY strangely... it will likely mean your wife is in labor. : ) Cats are notorious early warning signals for first time labors. They know before the mama does. 

Congratulations & good luck!
Uh oh. I only see one
I wish I wasn‚Äôt allergic to cats. Why couldn‚Äôt I be allergic to sweet peas instead
Our cat knew I was pregnant before I did, with each of my pregnancies  maybe she sensed that I was warmer. She usually prefers my partner and only gives me the time of day when she's hungry. When I was pregnant the first time, she snuggled me for days before I had a positive test. We laughed about it, but then she ignored me and I ended up miscarrying. The next time I got pregnant, she was pretty much glued to me from several days before my positive test until my baby was born. When we decided to try for baby #2, I just knew as soon as she climbed into my lap.
I know she‚Äôs probably uncomfortable and anxious to meet your little bun, but that sense of calm and quiet in this photo is going to be precious to you in the coming years. Twenty four years ago, when I was expecting our first child, my husband said, as we sat on the couch one night, ‚Äúhere that? That is a quiet we won‚Äôt hear for a long time.‚Äù He was right. Such an exciting and exhausting time ahead! Best of luck!
My cat used to purr right next to my pregnant belly, which made my baby move around inside to check it out.  It was the sweetest part of pregnancy.
Cats know - my assorted cats did that with my assorted pending children.  Only one wife. Your wife and and cat are cute! Congratulations!
Lovely photo. Congrats all round.
Oooo ooo oo my cats did this to my tummy when I was pregnant. Once my son was born, when he heard the cats purr he calmed right down and usually fell asleep. Please try and get the cats used to the baby as soon as he arrives so they can hopefully help you with your baby if they‚Äôre ever upset. You can take home some clothes the baby has worn in the hospital so they get used to the scent. (Sorry if you know all this, I just loved it when my son and cats carried on their bond that started in the womb.)
Had a cat that hated my kids mother, but when she was pregnant that cat was the first one to snuggle up with her.
awnn this is so cute my cat don't give a fuck about me üò¢

This was my favorite part of being pregnant (aside from the resulting baby)! I was supposedly infertile so I was never expecting to be pregnant at all, but my oldest cat seemed to know before I did. He wouldn't leave my side, and he started sleeping on my belly every day long before it had gotten any bigger. The baby would always react to his purrs when she started kicking, and when my daughter was born, that particular cat was her favorite thing in the world. My cat had always been terrified of babies and kids, but he made an exception for my daughter and snuggled up to her from day one. 

Unfortunately we had to put him down a couple of months ago at age 14 (difficult loss, I raised him since he was born), but I treasure the 2 years of memories he made with my daughter. I'm really glad he was a part of her life, and I hope your kitty has a similar place of honor in your new baby's life!
Momcat.
Oh fuck off for warming my heart.
I wish you and your family well bro. That's something precious you got in that photo, look after it
Sooooo.....warmmm....
*‚Äùsee this baby? It is mine now. This precious human is mine. Myeh.‚Äù*
This is so sweet! Cats are the best. I‚Äôm about 3 weeks from my due date too and my cat has been by my side non stop. Congrats and best wishes! üíú
Keeping that little nugget warm!!
So jealous! My cat didn't like my pregnant belly and doesn't like my 16 month old kid. She's polite to her, but prefers to not interact with the kid at all.
I love orange kitties :) this is precious.
The tug of war has already begun before the baby appears...

Cat: "mine!"
Warm the baby
Best of luck!,  my wife's a several weeks out!
Congratulations. Its an amazing journey.
New edition is already loved by the whole family üíï
Precious ü•∞ Kitty is claiming the new human
Thats incredibly beautiful. Are your cats female? I saw a similar video of this last week and wondered if felines can sense the baby more than male cats.
When I was pregnant my friends cats would all come out if no where to be near me.   They know
Your cat can likely hear baby‚Äôs heartbeat & smell hormonal changes. [source](http://amp.abc.net.au/article/life/11095410)
My cat did this all throughout my pregnancy. Then, he slept under my daughter's crib, then at the foot of her bed. He was her guard cat and constant companion until he passed this last Christmas. We miss him terribly. Cherish that kitty, looks like you got a good one.
This warms my little icicle covered heart!
New hooman
The baby will love cats and that‚Äôs a fact
Co cuteeeeee! Congrats!
Our cat is a better pregnancy test than anything I could buy. She is not much of a cuddler with me, prefers to be alone or with my husband, but within a couple weeks of getting pregnant she is all over me like butter on toast. I've had 3 pregnancies and she did the same thing for all of them! 

Then as soon as I am no longer pregnant, it's like I don't exist anymore lol.
This was my kitty until he got kicked by my baby. He gave my stomach the stack face and ran off and didn‚Äôt sit on it again. ü§£üò≠
Hey I hope everything goes alright with the delivery! Rooting for her! Even though I've never met well, either of you. POWER OF POSITIVITY.
I had a cat who would sleep in my daughter‚Äôs crib when she wasn‚Äôt in it.  They became very attached to each other as she grew up, he slept on her bed at night etc.  Unfortunately, when she was about 10 he ran away the first day at a new house and they never saw him again.
That‚Äôs so sweet. Congratulations.
Lovely.
We had a cat that did this too. They know
My dachshund does the same and I‚Äôm due in a little less than 3 weeks
updates of the cat snuggling with the little human when they get here.   
best of health and love.
Pretty sure that cat has laid claim to your child by law of surprise.

Hehe jk, congratulations!
Can the fetus hear the purring? (Probably) if so, is it comforting to them?
Feline Protector of the Baby
Congrats man.
Free cat massage! When the baby kicks lol
your cat love new baby lol
This is absolutely precious
Spitting image of my cat. He must get around.
Congratulations on the baby. Idk who you are but good luck from some random kid on the Internet.
Beautiful picture.
My cat did this while I was pregnant. Even after I miscarried she curled around my belly. I credit her for helping me grieve.
Fresh soul to harvest.
He protec.
Pregnant women are such an amazingly weird natural phenomenon. 

Just casually carrying a person around inside of them. Animals curling up to them. People wanting to listen to their bellies. And they just go on about their business, browsing the phone, living life until they push a brand new one out of them. 

Seriously. Imagine if we were all hatched in eggs, and someone tried to write a story about pregnancy. It'd blow people's minds.
I love your couch, do you know where you got it or the brand?
What a little lion!
Congrats folks!
Oi casada
It‚Äôs warm.
Mmm  *w a r m t h*
*10 days... You've been warned*
Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
The best thing about animals is how they sense something is going on with their owners.


Except snakes. They just want food.
Imagine your cat‚Äôs face when the belly is gone.
/u/SchoodleDoodleDoo made a pregnancy and cat related poem the other day that was great!
awww, congrats, i hope you post an updateon your new bundle of joy
My cats did, too. They also loved cuddling up to their butts after they were born.
H√ºg th√™ ƒçh√Ø≈Çd
We need that update cat-tax down the road once everyone is settled.
Cats are Reiki masters.
This must be such a scary time to be having a child. I wish you both the best of luck. Much happiness to your family.
You guys think the baby could hear the cats heartbeat as well?
OP, is it a boy?
Your wife looks great being so close to her due date. I was a bloated mess by that point. Tell her she‚Äôs doing great!
Purring is good for cats health, wonder if it's beneficial to the baby.
We have 4 cats and all of them knew something was different with my wife. Our oldest cat (the cat my wife already had when we met) would crawl into my wife's belly and sleep there whenever he had a chance. He wasn't the cuddliest cat before she was pregnant but during her pregnancy it's like he claimed the baby.
Our cat did the same with my wife. It was a routine at night when she went to bed he'd follow and wait till she got comfortable then snuggled right up on her belly
Obviously. Tiny free massages and no one looking at them awkwardly
Such a nice picture to remember
Congratulations!  Is this ur 1st?   ü§ó
I have a feeling your child to be will be the cat's favorite human!
Our cats were all over my wife the whole time she was pregnant.  It was very cute.
Funny enough, that's how we got suspicious that my wife was pregnant. Our dogs all of a sudden started snuggling up to her belly. 

When the home test was positive we went to the doctor and found out she was around six weeks. Animal instincts are weird lol.

Congratulations to you two.
My friends cat did that w their first child, amazing
Read that as your wife is expiring in three weeks. Hope the baby is well when it‚Äôs due!
So cute!!
My 7 yo tells everyone proudly how our cat used to snuggle with her when she was still in my belly. To this day they're absolute best friends.
Is her belly warmer than normal? 

I always remember that episode of House.
The cat knows there is another soul to be sucked out developing.  My poor kitty was disappointed that a ginger beat him to mine but loves me anyways.
I wonder if the cat can hear the heartbeat of the baby?
They know what‚Äôs going on. (Might not be happy once they hear baby crying!)
Classic pillow setup.
God bless
It probably feels like one of those massage chairs

My wife just poped 3weeks from her due date. It's our baby Bowies 1st forth of July. He's a week old now
Cats are the best people
Cats know something is up. Ours did the same with my wife.
My cat was like that with both my kids. She was so sweet. When the baby was born she was real protective, too. Almost annoyingly so. Lol
Heartbeat?

or

"Mine"?
This makes me happy. Thank you!
Keeping he kiddo extra warm to hatch it.
You are going to have kittens!
Blessed child
My cat this did too. We have 2 cats, one that is mine and the other is my husband. This just because they are more fond of one of us.

When I was on the couch reading he would come there and draped himself against my belly. Even if my baby kicked heavily he would have stayed there.

When on the couch reading he usually just sleeps on my legs. This was definitely different and so cute.
Because it's warm! Cats are opportunists not romantics ;)
I love cats, when I had my appendix, gallbladder, and cancer surgery, they cuddled me and purred.
That's really hot. There is no way my wife could have handled having a baby in her belly and a cat
*Dibs*
Ahh yes, the internal belly heater.
Very happy for the two of you I hope everything goes well with the delivery
Plot twist: The cat is the father

Also congratulations
Cat: OUR wife
I see she uses a Crotch Pillow.... so do I, sooo comfy....
Cats love snuggling warm objects
My cat used to headbutt my wife‚Äôs belly and purr really loud. Now my cat doesn‚Äôt actively seek attention from my wife. Kinda weird but cats do what cats do.
There are a lot of jerks out there that will tell pregnant women that they either must get rid of their cats, or have them declawed, so that they won‚Äôt hurt the baby... but both of those things are not true

I‚Äôm glad to see that you have your cats, and that( hopefully) you did not get them declawed...
Your human kitten has been chosen to be protected by felines from this day forward
It's actually only the second-best subreddit for the cute animals.
"Looks like meat's gonna be back on the meownu boys"
That couch is dope. Looks comfy, great color.
Not trying to be a killjoy, I thought pregnant women couldn't be around cats.
We‚Äôre 5 weeks!
I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this, but your wife is pregnant with a keyboard.
Little did he know the cat is the REAL father
They are trying to smother it from the outside.
Team Knee-Pillow!!
My orange cat did the same when I was prego. He is now the guardian of the baby. I call him the nanny.
Do we have the same couch
I imagine the belly is the warmest spot.
What does the other cat look like?
It‚Äôs almost like they can smell the soul they will be collecting.
Hey my wife is 4 weeks away!! Our cats are suuuuper jealous too lol. 

Ive been reading dad books today. Lots to look forward to and a lot to be scared of too heh. Good luck, new dad!!!
This should be a painting
My wife's cat is constantly cuddly with her because she's pregnant. It's how we suspected she was before taking a test.
Your cat will love your kid forever ‚ù§Ô∏èüòª
Lucky! For many reasons.
Cats gonna be pissed in a few weeks. Ain't got anything to snuggle.
Good luck bro. Bank up on sleep while you can! :)
I would find a cat curled on my pregnant belly.  The first time he jumped on me which I then yelled at him.  After that he was very gentle.  He got scared when a heel would poke through.
Hope you got your bags packed. Both of mine came three weeks early!

Cute pic.
That's adorable, good luck with the baby  :)
Aww, I remember when I had that same "get this human tornado OUT of me" aura!

Best of luck!
My cat loves to cuddle near my stomach too!!! Is it a male or female?
Looks like he‚Äôs claiming your child as their own
First kid?
That's cuz there's a baby in there.
I wonder why that is. Babies heart beat faster, and so the cats‚Ä¶ Maybe reminds them of their moms or siblings or something.
My cat with the same coloring always hugged my pregnant belly.
Awww. They know...
Congrats! My wife is also 3 weeks from her due date but we have no cats cuz I‚Äôm allergic.
My cat LOVES me when I‚Äôm pregnant. She always curls up on my belly and just purrs like she‚Äôs in heaven. When I‚Äôm not pregnant? I can just fuck off.

Our dog started doing this around the middle of the pregnancy. Baby is due in 3 weeks as well now. Let's see how this develops :)

Also, best of luck to the both of you.
Congrats! Did your wife go to highschool in NE San Antonio early 2000s? She looks very familiar..
the content we need right now üíïcongrats to your fam!!
That‚Äôs wonderful! I imagine they can both feel it AND hear it in there.
As a non cat person this wholesome ass stuff makes.me be like " ok maybe cats arent pure evil"
Do you think cats call us chonk too?
That‚Äôs a beautiful picture
Dude our kids might be born on the same day haha
My dog would rest her head on my belly. My cat cuddled with me way more, too.
I know that couch! It has a pull out double bed don't it?
Man that couch looks so comfy
That is so sweet...animals know...they are so tuned in!
The way pets act sometimes makes me think they must be reincarnations of past relatives.
He's just waiting for the meal inside
Aww, he looks like my former cat... I miss him
Wishing a safe healthy birth for your wife and baby!
This is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
That cat was a loving husband in his past life
Will that be your first child?
My non snuggly cat would snuggle next to me on the couch when I was pregnant ü•∞ I heard  some cats love this.
I had a beagle that did the same
That's so cool.
The cat's like "new playmate, can't wait!!!" Praying for a healthy kiddo for you and your lady
Omg that is so adorable!!!! Congrats to you and the wifey!!
That couch looks hella comfy.
That is precious. I would be interested to see the bond between your baby and the kitty after birth. So sweet
Be ready, my sister ‚Äúgrowled‚Äù when she was happy after two Siamese purred relentlessly on her in utero!
I‚Äôm currently 32 weeks along and my one kitty does the same to me ü•∞

My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and our little girl dog, who is also pregnant almost never leaves her side... regardless of how great my rubdowns are... :-(

It‚Äôs altogether adorable and sad because I want some company too!
WOOOOOO!!!! WATER BED!!!
Good luck brodie! Most terrifying time of my life but its been that absolute best thing thats ever happened to me. Enjoy it!
I see only one cat.  I'm gonna need a pic of that other cat,  pronto
She's so warm..

I love this üíï
Awwwwwwwwwwww
Warm bits
I hope she has a short and easy labor and a healthy baby.
My cat did this with me until my son was born in February & 6 months later she died suddenly. I miss my little Princess Popcorn so much. I only got five years with her. I lost my dog too, but at least she was 12 years old. 2020 has been a bitch (don‚Äôt tell my son I said that)
Pls show us the new baby with the cat
God bless your wife, what a trooper ... its tough being pregnant, pregnant in the summer and then multiply that by the ultimate of a pandemic.

Wishing you a safe, healthy and joyous delivery and addition to your family.

Oh yah, your kitty is adorable too, loving on her momma and her soon to be sibling
The cats are like "We are getting a little human, yay!"
Awe man she‚Äôs got to be so ready! Ugh. Be cool and show the love. It‚Äôs amazing man!
This is so freaking awesome and this is the best example of why I love to look for wonderful cat pictures on Reddit. All the best to you on your upcoming new addition! Sending joy and gratitude!
This melts meüíóüêæüíñüêæüíó

That kitty looks more comfortable than I've been in 20 years.
Knock knock
Thank youüåª
My cat Looks just like that one and did the same thing to my wife for all 3 babies.
I swear my ex girlfriends cat loved me more than my ex did
Precious!  Good luck!
So cute üòã
i find an incredible amount of warmth and comfort and beauty in this photo. you are a lucky man enjoy your blessings and peace be upon you all

Cats are so protective of babies <3
Damn...ready to deliver in the Summer heat!

Your wife is a tough cookie.
Congratulations!!!
My cat did the same thing. I mean he already was all over her When she was pregnant her stomach was his spot
Awwwww
Animals know!
It‚Äôs trying to get that fresh meat
They know, Bruce our dog wouldn't get up on poking my wife's tummy
... I read this as three cats away from her due date. Oop
Purfectly precious üòªüò∫üôÄüêà. Congratulations to you all, I hope and pray the birth goes well . God bless and keep you all.
bro the thought of having a wife and expecting a child is one of the most things i'm most excited about my future. congratulatiosn :)
Is there some science behind this?
So... much.. adorable...
Cats can be cool when they‚Äôre not busy being pricks.
My wife is also 3 weeks away from her due date, and our dog that's about the size of your cat does the same thing.   It's adorable!
My mom told me when she was pregnant with me my cat would lay on top of the belly while she slept. When I was born and the belly wasn‚Äôt there my cat tried to lay down and fell right off lol
My best friend's wife was pregnant. They came to visit. My cat wouldn't go near her and kept hissing. This is the same cat they watched for me for a couple years that loved and always cuddled her.

Some cats just hate pregnant women, something about the hormones. I looked it up but have forgotten the details, since.
They are getting ready for their meal
You own the SNICK couch?!?!
How do i train my cat to do this?
Are there any verified studies about this behavior in cats and dogs? It‚Äôs not the first time I‚Äôve noticed a cat or dog become unusually attached to the woman of the house if she‚Äôs pregnant. I imagine they can detect the pheromones that signal a pack mate is pregnant or something like that. (On top of being very, very sweet).
it will grow up with DOUBLE AS MUCH LOVE!
when my ex was pregnant with our first child, her mother told us to get rid of the cats as they would "suck the breath out of the baby".   
This was in the U.S. in the 20th century. She was serious. SMH.  
(No, we did not get rid of the cats.)
Cats are so goddamn weird
Warmth and two heartbeats. What‚Äôs  not to like?
‚ÄúMom looks cold I‚Äôll help.‚Äù
The baby is going to have the power to control cats, just you wait.
My brother's cat did the same thing when I was pregnant! She would not leave my lap any time I was there. She never did that before or after.
Id snuggle too
They know. They can hear the baby.
I don‚Äôt thinks it‚Äôs your kid
I'm just shy of three weeks out and neither my cats or dogs give a shit. üò©
This cat has more consensual touching with a woman than I ever had.
Awww they detect baby hooman
Awesome cat, I bet she's/he's excited to see the baby pretty soon!
This is adorable!
They probably love the feel of the fast heartbeat.
Kinda have to wonder if the baby kicks...are we gonna have a toes under the sheets sort of thing
Awwww this is so cute
I love how your cat is like, this one is mine.
Need that kind of hugs
Now dats cute brothers or sisters already!!
you are getting a son. I do face reading
As someone who had two summer pregnancies, your wife has my condolences.  I also wouldn't have let anything with fur on me because it's just another heat source.
Good luck! me and my wife are a month on after the birth. Hell cometh!
They‚Äôre helping keep baby warm
Why are cats so affectionate towards bellies with babies?
when I eat too much my tiny son do on my fat tummy
That's very sweet.
Hey, I‚Äôm three weeks from my birthday! Wait a minute...
One of my cats was the same way when I was pregnant. My son is now 14 and they‚Äôve been inseparable best friends ever since.
Omgosh so cute! Your cat looks just like my ginger boy too!
Belly is warm
Hope everything comes out alright.
I‚Äôm just fat but my cats love my belly too üòÇ

I thought your wife was Ava Addams for a moment while scrolling. Nice Bro.
Wow, mine cuddled up to the bump, but this is a whole extra level of Lovin'! 

Super cute. All the best with the new addition!
Awwwwwwwhh!
And she's still on tinder.
Your cats are gonna be really mad once the baby is born
Because Its the cats baby
I love this! My cat would not come anywhere near my belly when I was pregnant.
My Siamese slept against my belly every night when I was pregnant with my youngest. Now, he still insists on curling up with me at night.
He's a purring teddy bear.
Plot twist: they're hearing what the baby is saying
More space to rest her body
I have been told that cats will snuggle your belly during pregnancy; also that they know when you're pregnant and start doing the snuggling even if you don't know you're pregnant yet. Interesting.
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
When I was pregnant with our son, our cat would lay her head  on my belly and listen.
Great photo
Honestly, üòµ‚ò†Ô∏è from cuteness overload!!
Pillow between her legs while laying on her side...definitely pregnant üòÇ congrats!
That cat‚Äôs gonna be so confused three weeks from now.
Sweet!
Be careful that the cat may spread some dangerous germs to the mother which may harm the baby especially from the letter box. Stay safe.
I bet the cat will love the baby
Cats just like cuddling up against a human's tummy in general, our stomachs are warm and soft which they like.
Congratulations
I'm surprised no one has mentioned it, but if I were you I'd keep the cat away from her, google Toxoplasmosis, it's not uncommon in cat feces, I remember my parents taking care of family cats whenever a relative was pregnant to avoid it
Our doctor said not to have cats around when pregnant?
My cats tried this but would soon get annoyed at the karate kicks coming from roundhouse baby.
They know food is in there.
‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre the little shit she traded in her big heating pad for‚Äù
My cat just peed on everything.
Women are so beautiful!
That's how I hold my microwave when it's almost done.

Enjoy your final 3 weeks of the simple life.
As someone who dislikes toxoplasmosis. Have you had that cat tested?
Hum if your baby is born with a fur spot don't worry bout it you know the cause
I remember the pregnant wife body pillow.  That thing got way more attention than I did - which was just fine.  The first time around we had a kicker that kicked so much my wife developed costochondritis, aka super inflamed rib muscles.   Since the best treatment is ibuprofen my wife just had to tough it out since you're not supposed to have that during pregnancy.

The second time she had twins, so yeah.....body pillow ftw!
They're consoling their prey

Is it your first? I have an 11 month old. This new journey has shown me my true purpose in life.
Sorry if you already knew but keep the kittehs out of babies room as they like to sleep on faces.
I too choose this guys wife.
wanted to make a cursed comment but this is not the right place
in a couple of days:

Wheres the warm pillow human? and whats that noisy and smelly thing you brought?
This is so sweet! I‚Äôm 9 weeks away and my cat couldn‚Äôt give less of a shit
They just want to eat whats inside
They know they are about to become irrelevant.
The cats are putting spells on your baby. They are attempting to create their cat-messiah who will lead them to world domination. In the ancient tongue of the first cats, his name shall be Vincent. And he shall be played by Ron Perlman.
Cause it‚Äôs the cats baby bud
That's probably because they're just as excited to meet their new member of the pack as you are.
I hope you and your family have a wonderful life together <3
3 weeks away from my due date as well and my belly is my kittens favorite sleeping area!

Wait. Isn‚Äôt pregnancy and cats a potent combination? 

https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/toxoplasmosis/gen_info/pregnant.html
I just keep remembering how much the OB for my sons mother kept stressing for her to stay the fuck away from cats while pregnant. 


There's a reason why the OB tells you that.
Umm are you sure it‚Äôs not the cat‚Äôs baby
congrats on the sex.
Damn bro, she single?
Is your wife the cat? If so dang she looking fine.
Lovely - we will need to see puss with bubby later!
i only see one cat
I read today that cats can hear ultrasound! Maybe that‚Äôs why, the cat can hear the baby moving.
If the baby kicks, the cat would go flying.
As the owner of 4 champion tracking dogs I can not explain just how sensitive a animals nose is compared to our own.
"The sacrifice is nearly ready."
There‚Äôs the boomers the millennials and the gen Z but you have given birth to a coronial.  Just kidding congrats
Congrats man on the baby!!!! Personal question, and I understand if you wish to not answer, but what are you planning on naming them?
I'm feel for you. my wife is 2 weeks away and she's entering the she-devil phase.  Cats won't go near her now.
The cat's already trying to smother the baby. Don't leave it alone with your child!
Adorable. My dog did the same with my wife. Wishing you and your family all the best and your wife a quick and simple labour!
Around this time my cat TURNED on me. Hissing and growling when ever I came in the house. It got so bad that we thought we had to get rid of him. The baby was born two years ago, and we haven‚Äôt had one problem since! Cats know what‚Äôs going on and get very protective! That‚Äôs what it seemed like at least.
My wife is also 3 weeks away from giving birth. Our cat still sits on her lap but she's convinced the cat doesn't give a shit about baby.
It hungers...
He‚Äôs the father bro
My wife's due date is tomorrow and she still yells at the dogs when they jump on the couch.
If you're going to say "cats", there better be more than one cat in the photo.
Cats love finding warm spots to lay.. he must feel the warmth radiating off mom's belly. This is where he probably the closest to you and looks at you as his mom. The warmest and safest place to be is in the womb, so kitty feels that. It's a sweet and beautiful moment. Thanks for sharing this picture. üòª
It's warm
Glad to see this! When my ex wife was pregnant with our son, our one female cat Misa turned violent and had attacked my Mil and my wife. We tried many different medications but after months we had to have her out down. It turned out that at some point in her life, she had had a stroke, which we only found afterwards.
My wife's cat moved in with her mum. When she was pregnant, the cat did the same thing even when there was no bump at all. Amazing creatures they is.
I can‚Äôt wait for this to be me!! My parents have two dogs and a cat and I‚Äôm hoping they all show this level of love
Pregnancy?

Cat?

Front page?

*Yup*
Enjoy it while it lasts.
i have seen this photo with this exact same comments, all about the beer belly‚Äôs and shared stories and all but i know this ain‚Äôt a repost. we‚Äôre talking massive fucking premonition type deja vu here people, like when you have a dream and it comes true type shit
I have always really enjoyed spending time with my wife's belly when she has been pregnant. It let me feel like I knew each of our boys a little bit before they were born. Our oldest is mischievous. He would freeze when I tried to feel him moving in utero. Our youngest was always happy and wiggly to have dad come to visit with him. He still is. I hope you're getting a chance to feel that baby movement too dad/mom/whatever it is 2020 you do you.

I think the cats should stay away...
We get it dude you have sex

This isn't cute at all. Cats are the world's most common carriers of *Toxoplasma gondii*, a parasite that targets the brain. Should pregnant women have contact with cats at all, the child will be at high risk of developing congenital toxoplasmosis.
damn, she should get working on that book report rather than playing on her phone

Soo, thats sweet and all... so we all just keep ignoring the risk of toxoplasmosis? I mean pregnant women and cats are not really a match made in heaven...
Toxoplasmosis
Props to your wife for taking care of her health along with her unborn child's. Saw so many gain 100lbs+ of 'baby weight' that somehow was still there when the baby became a toddler.

Hey I'm looking to reupholster my furniture and I'm taking measurements.  

How many basketballs did it take to make that couch?
Wheres the other cat?....

I see A cat. Where's the rest?!
So do I
How does she do fighting armed enemies in a post apocalyptic fungus zombie infested world? Asking for a friend
Cats?
those cats are gonna be wondering where that belly went in a few weeks
[deleted]
Is it just me or does she look like Dina?
There is this old myth in my family that says expecting mothers shouldn't be around cats? Something about a disease that cat might transfer to the mother and possibly harm the baby, is there any truth in this?
OP is a liar. I only see one cat snuggling her tummy tum.
It'll be trying to suffocate the baby for real soon...
,6 x6
You sure it‚Äôs your OP?

I hope you don‚Äôt do what I see so many first time parents do, that is as soon as the baby comes, the pet gets knocked down several priority rungs, no longer receiving the attention, care, and love they once were afforded. It‚Äôs one of the many gross aspects of human parenthood I‚Äôve witnessed over the years.

It‚Äôs all fun and games until the little human is actually there
Your wife is pretty. Just in case you didn‚Äôt know. Sorry if i sound creepy lol
Oh gorgeous! 

Please be very careful with the bub when it is born- cats are known to snuggle in and suffocate the bub. We combated this with a mosquito net clipped around the cot to prevent any access for the cat.
Congrats on getting laid!
Wait till they start smelling milk and getting pissed and acting crazy and spraying stuff or shitting outside the litter box. We had to rehome ours after trying so hard to help him get back to normal. Good luck.
Cats arent good for pregnancy
Congrats on knocking up a cutie
I guess she doesn't know it's not good for her to be around cats
You say it‚Äôs cute.  I say that cat is already trying to smother that child.
You should get rid of the cats if you don't want your kid to get toxoplasmosis, and possibly schizophrenia.
She ready to punch you in the face. I don‚Äôt know why, it just seems like irony, passively reclining yet...
 I won't take that risk! 
Toxoplasmosis is a disease transmitted by cats, and it can cause pregnant women to miscarry or cause brain damage to the fetus.Aug 11, 2017

Why pregnant women should be careful around cats - AJC.com
Pregnant mothers should be wary of being around cats my dear...
Proof women can be pregnant and stay thin üëçüëç
Cats often climb in cribs and lay on the babies face and suffocate them...
Your cat wants to strangle the baby. I heard cats try to suffocate a newborn over attention
Yikes you really should not have cats around someone who is pregnant, there‚Äôs a chance of the baby getting toxoplasmosis and I think it‚Äôs really serious if they do, I would heavily recommend doing some research
This can actually be fairly dangerous, when my grandmother was pregnant with my mother and did this a parasite in the cat managed to somehow get inside the womb and cause her to be blind in one eye, be careful!
Aren't cats not ideal during pregnancy or right after it? Something to do with germs. Please look into this.
