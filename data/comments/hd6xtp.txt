Awww well now you have to bring her with you!
Our dogs know what the suitcase means. Then their mood shifts between nervous they’re going to be left behind and excited they might be going too. It’s a roller coaster of emotions for them I’m sure lol.

We have to hold off letting our yorkie know she’s going because she becomes INSANE with excitement. Going with us always means a road trip and she will find a way to get into the car and will sit there for hours while we load, barking at us. The worst is when we have to remove her from the car when she’s not going, thankfully that’s rare. It’s heartbreaking.
She's even got her sweater on, ready to go. It'd be rude to leave her home now.
Tell Bonnie I love her
You weren't going to leave her behind, were you OP???? You're not like... a monster, are you?
Can't tell if it's a "you forgot to pack my things cuz I"m definitely going with you" moment,
Or a "it's dangerous to go alone so take my favorite toy with you" moment,

But either way I love it. Doggo♡♡♡
Well looks like you are going on a guilt trip.
Bonnie: “you forgot to pack this, where are we going?”
Our puppy dragged his carrying case to the door while we were at the store yesterday. And the cat sat in hers the entire time we were packing once.
My heart! 💔😭, she's so lovely.
Mannnnn. I know people joke about being guilted by their dogs but the weight I feel in my chest looking at this photo🥺. I hope she has someone nice to stay w her while y’all are gone!
My cat will climb into my suitcase and hide. I almost took her on a cruise trip once! Thankfully I noticed that my suitcase was a little bit heavier than I remembered.
Cancel the trip.
Back in mid 2000 amid the tension in Iraq, my family left the country hastily, I stayed back to finish my education with relatives and our family dog.. Few years later I finished my education and I was leaving too.. 

After finishing packing, our dog saw me bringing my luggage to the front door, I could see his heart dropped, unbeknownst to him I had his cage ready to go with me... Never seen a happier dog to jump into the cage and never wanna leave..
You know you’re a grownup when your bag looks like that, and not two plastic grocery bags with shit haphazardly crammed in there.
Whenever we get suitcases out our cat knows she's not going to like what's gonna happen so she's climbs in and takes a nap all stretched out so we can't pack.
She’s even wearing her nicest sweater
Awww! (sobs into tea) That sweet face!
Bonnie by name, bonny by nature
What kind of dog is she??? She looks exactly like my Rogue, and I have no idea what she is.
Lol, my dog has done this to me twice. Both times I didn't find the toy until mid trip, and asked my husband why he packed a dog toy. She likes us more than we know.
Oh my god. This made me miss my dog so much. He’d sit on top of the packed suitcase and refuse to move. I miss you so much my chucho.
At first I thought it was a turd
Thought it was a turd first haha but she's so cute!
 This just melted mine and my gf’s heart
You put it in there.
I hate leaving my cat behind. After 3 trips she learned the pattern. Suitcase means mama is leaving for a few days. She either immediately sits on my lap or on top of the suitcase and I have to coax her off. Breaks me heart.
There’s no guilt trip like a “please don’t leave me” dog guilt trip
Sure she did
No she didn’t. You posted this for karma.  Be real
My old yellow lab would jump in the trunk of a small car, so we wouldn’t forget her before leaving on vacation. LOL
I hate that look. I feel such guilt when my fur child looks at me like that.
"It's dangerous to go alone, take this."
When I first moved away to college our oldest dog, Murphy, didn’t understand why I wasn’t home. I came back home to visit and right before I left I wanted to check my empty bedroom real quick. Murphy had left his favorite toy right in the middle of the bedroom in hopes I wouldn’t leave again. I immediately began to tear up. RIP Murphy.

Big doubt
r/thathappened
At first, I thought that was a poop.
I dunno, I smell /r/untrustworthypoptarts material...
So staged it’s cringe
no she didn't
Doubt.
Surely this is not a staged pic.
"I won't take up much room."
Her face literally says “pretty pretty please take me with you please i love you and you love me and this is all we need”
No, she fucking didn't.
No she didn't.
r/thatHappened

You definitely didn't do that
oh wow - she got it right perfectly in the middle too and the right way up?
For some reason, I get the feeling you put the toy there yourself. But this has 40k+ upvotes, so I must be wrong, right?
Yeah, that happened
Forget the dog, that’s the neatest packed suitcase I’ve ever seen! What’s your secret?
All these gullible people wanting to believe that OP didn’t put that here themselves for a picture to get fake internet points.
No, you put it there. Right in the middle. Just perfectly.
I bet OP put the toy there and struggled with the dog for 30 mins to make it sit still for long enough for them to take this picture.
My dog does the same thing with her ball
"Bonnie"... shoutout to The Woody Show fans out there ;)
NGL I thought that was a turd
What breed is she?? I swear my dog is your dog’s long lost sibling.
How did you come up with her name? I also have a Bonnie, but we have a Clyde too.
You MONSTER! How dare you leave this sweet pupper at home! ❤️
When we bring out the suit cases my dog is very unhappy. She has barked, growled and will lay next to it with a sad face. Makes you not want to leave.
Why are you bringing your pillow and not your dog dressed like your pillow?
It looks like a turd
She is gorgeous! I have had my cats get into a half-packed suitcase and fall asleep.
Is she coming with you? IS SHE COMING WITH YOU???
Trip is cancelled

For work? Fuck it. I quit
You have to cancel that trip immediately.
I feel my heart crack
Only trip you're taking is a guilt trip
R/thathappened
Dogs are very intuitive
Legit thought it was a poop
Riiiight in the middle too huh.
r/untrustworthypoptarts
No she didnty
No, she didn't,you pathetic liar.
So cute
Oh, that face.
Bonnie in her sweater is the cutest ahhhh
BONNIE
That means she's going too!
How can you tell her otherwise?!
My dog has that same knit sweater, but she is a chihuahua mix and fits totally different :P
“Here Hooman, bring this with you so you shall remember me in hopes that you might return someday. I will remember all of the pats, belly rubs, and treats you gave me. While you are gone I will eat the couch”
My recently adopted dog looks exactly like Bonnie. Do you know what breed/mix she is???
Depending on where you go, you'll be able to say your Bonnie lies over the ocean.
Omg and her freaking sweater 😭 so precious
At first I thought it was a turd
SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG SWEATER DOG
Funny how pets know you're going, my puppy took a shit in my suitcase  just before I was going to start packing.
Oh god. I feel the feels all the way over here.
Well you're going to have to cancel the trip now.
Well that's it, you must cancel your trip!
Not trying to sound like an ass, but why do people put sweater vests on animals that already have a natural fur coat? I might understand if it's winter where you live and he was outside.
My heart just broke with love. Awwww
Feel like it might’ve been scripted but still MIGHTY cute
dont leave her!!
You're.... taking Bonnie with you, right?

RIGHT!?
♥ 💕 Aww, we definitely believe that you didn't just put it there yourself and tell your dog to sit there. ♥ 💕
So sweet! ♥ 💕
What breed is she? My dog looks almost identical and we've been trying to figure it out, even the vets couldnt figure it out
“Karen, there’s a global pandemic. Stay home. At least take me with you ” -Bonnie, probably
I would be hard pressed to go anywhere after that. Look at that Bonnie face.
This is why I hide my luggage in the closet, pack in there ( walk in closet) and transport it out under a blanket or coat.
OP, it's you who put it in the suitcase. Prove me wrong.
She even put her traveling cardigan on.
yeah, that happened...mhmm
No she didn’t.
Clever girl. Love it.
What a good girl
Are we not going to discuss his adorable sweater vest?? ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Oh the sweetest baby!!
My dog will lay on top of my suitcase and whine/flash the puppy eyes and it's heartbreaking
can I just please hug her
Hehehhe Awww wuv her outfit 🥰🥰😍😊So cute
I'm packed.  Let's go.🐕🤭
My dog loathes even short car rides, cowers when I have to put him in the car.  I had to get something from the Veterinarian just to take him to the Veterinarian.  If I pack a suitcase though, he’s all in.  He hops in like it’s the best day in his life tail going a mile a minute.  Then 10 minutes later he lays on the back floor sick as a himself.
I see you’re going on a guilt trip.
So precious.
My friends dog was super distressed when she was packing up all the dogs stuff. He looked as if he thought he was going to be sent to a kennel, but luckily for him it was just a family vacation!
Awe my heart strings
is your dog actually wearing a cardigan
"I'll bring you another one if you take this uncomfortable sweater off me."
for one moment I thought she shit on your suitcase
Awwwww. That is so cute! She said I’m coming with you
r/packthedamndog
r/thathappened
I'll take, Things that didn't happen for $300, Alex
What kind of dog is this absolute princess
Omg! Look at that face and body language! Breaks my heart that she can’t go with you and I hope it’s a short trip. Perhaps you can post on r/masterreturns for those of us who are now worried about her...?
i thought it was her/his poop lol
I'm dying of cuteness
oh noo!! OH NOOOOOOOO! 💔💔💔💔💔
Bonnie lookin thicccc in that sweater 😍😍
Take her with you 🥺
Ahh,  that's so special !  Maybe she thinks you are putting your important things in there and wants you to have her important thing ....  cause she loves you !
Either she go’s with or you don’t go. Pick wisely
Cuz she doesn't want to leave without it.

...you're taking her with you, right? Right?!
I don’t know whether this is Bonnie saying, ‘Take me,’ or, ‘I love you so here is my favourite toy to comfort you and remind me of you when you are away.’ Either way it makes me sad.
This is why I don’t go anywhere after getting a dog.
Okay, I gotta ask.
My father in law has a dog that looks exactly like yours. He was adopted off the side of the road and fil never knew what breed he was. Do you, by any chance, happen to know what breed your sweet girl is?
What bread is she I have a dog that looks just like her and we have no idea what bread he is
See if you can spot my dog trying to send a similar message earlier this year...

 https://imgur.com/a/WboGUwX 

Also, I have luggage/packing envy...
My heart 😭
The ears say it all
She’s even thoughtful enough to match* her attire to the liner of your luggage, what a precious travel buddy Bonnie is!!
You are now legally obligated to stay home.  Sorry, it’s the rules.
How do we know you're not lying?
Covid 19 hasnt vanished yet so where you going?
Bonnie looks like she could be my dog's sister...had to check your post history because in this photo they look identical! http://imgur.com/gallery/6LkkrDa

http://imgur.com/gallery/TBY14h1
Why does she have clothes?
No, she didn’t
Am I the only one who thinks the dog didn't put the toy there?
Any time my suitcase comes out, my dog knows that he’s either about to have the time of his life or be alone and depressed.
No, Bonnie is bribing you with her favorite toy for you to take off that disgusting shirt. Look at the dog's face isn't it obvious?
💔❤
One of my dogs is bonnies twin!! She’s got the puppy dog eyes down
That’s a nice sweater Bonnie has
Awwwwwwwwww
True love!! You are fortunate# 💖💖
Don’t forget about me toys hooman
This is so you don't get too lonely while you're away from her. What a goodest girl!
She wants you to not forget her!!!
"take it so you don't forget about me."
"Something to remember me by, bitch"
Aw her sweater and face
Bonnie looks very nice in her sweater :)
Her face. 🥺 dogs are people
Lucky, my dog take a revenge shit in my packed bag
I'm not crying, you are
Well, hate to tell you, OP, but the trip is cancelled. 🤣
aww, take her with you!
Omg I would melt to the floor O_O Ah well you're not going anywhere or she's coming with you.
What kind of dog is Bonnie? Our dog has similar markings so I was curious because he’s a mix.  Look at her pretty face
One of the cutest things I’ve seen in a while!
Awwww
What kind of dog?
Aww! She looks like a sweet girl I saw on a walk this morning.
Well, better call of the business trip. Bonnie wants you to be unemployed so you'll spend more time with her!
But are you leaving her behind??? I need answers
Can I just say that Bonnie is NOT ALLOwed that is TOO CUTE I'm 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Now if my dog did that, I might think I should take it with me so he knows I’m coming back to return it someday, oooor if I leave it behind would that be an insult and he could fear I’m never returning?  What’s the etiquette here??
I love Bonnie’s outfit!
My dogs have always hopped in the suitcase when I’m packing... makes leaving home even harder.
My dog will crawl into anything if she thinks I’m leaving
Last time I packed a suitcase my cat threw up all over it a few hours before I was leaving for the airport. Cats.
She's a good girl 🤗💙🙏
Did you pack a pillow?
♥️
I hoped you unpacked and cancelled your plans!
She has the sweetest face!!!
She wants to go with you!
Bro you can express your emotion in a way other than "the feels".
Cute dog. Why the sweater though?
I love her sweater
She’s clearly going with you.
The dog put it there nice and straight to the sides of the case.
These posts make me wanna get a dog but my place is small :(
I'M NOT CRYING YOU'RE CRYING
Oh my goodness! So sweet!
Awww she’s so cute. She looks pretty much identical to my dog and we don’t know what kind of dog she is (rescue). Do you know what your sweety is??
Just that look "You knew I was gonna.."
You better take her with you🥺
My sister-in-law cat does the same .
Take her with you
Nice sweater
Oooooooohhhhhhh 😄😄😄😄
Wow
Mmk but why is the dog wearing a virgin killer?
My dog did that to me, also. I didn't see the toy until I got off my flight. she put it in the luggage.
She just wants you to play with her.
My grandma‘a little dog was dumped in the country near her farm home, and that’s how Grandma adopted her. 

Tippy had serious abandonment anxiety. If Grandma got her suitcase out (she’d travel to stay with one aunt/uncle at a time), Tippy would go nuts trying to stay between Grandma and the door. 

Grandma figured out that if she put the leash on or in the suitcase, all Tippy’s anxiety would melt away.
Cute
Tell me you also had room for your liv and laff posters in there!
Hardest part of leaving on a trip by far !
Where are you and Bonnie going because I know you not leaving her at home >:(
This dog wears a sweater. Of course she’s coming.
Not gonna lie... before I read the title I legit thought she took a shit in your suitcase. It looked like it when the pic was small on phone.
If you put a sweater on your dog in the middle of summer, you might be apart of the mental health crisis...
I adopted my first dog and then a few months later I went on holiday. A friend of mine was going to look after her while I was gone in my house. We got the suitcases out and then my dog ran into my arms and buried her head on me. She didn't want me to go. Poor girl. She was also never a big fan of travelling either. It made her anxious. I loved that dog.
I’m going to assume that pillows is a temporary dog bed and you are taking your dog right?
Ears back like that = ultimate love too.
wrr
Very nice floor - is it terrazzo? Or a special exposed aggregate screed mix?
this busty beauty in her SNAZZY sweater vest is trying to tell you something!   

"Will give you birb if you promise not to leave me forevah.   Will guilt you until you say you stay."
“I’m all packed and ready to go”
"Bring? Please?"
Your Bonnie looks so much like my dad's Mugsy. To the point I showed this picture to my sister and she thought it was my dad's dog. She would do this exact thing too, probably, if my dad ever packed to go anywhere. She loves him so much, I can only imagine it's the same for you. Queensland heeler mix?
Awe, what a sweetie!  She looks just like my girl
Bruh
That face!! So sweet
Omg her sweater 😍
Not sure if it's been said, but you pack one hell of a tidy suitcase!
her sweater!! I love her!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I love the sweater!! So adorable 🥰
“I’m ready to go, when are we leaving?”

She has to come now:( she packed up and everything:(
"You finish picture humoon, I can has toy back?"
Why is she dressed better than me?
Oh my heart just squished ❤️❤️❤️
Bonnie has better fashion sense than I do.
Oh... my heart is breaking...
Aww
so now you gotta cancel your trip
I went on vacation ones when I was really young and we had to give my rabbit to one of those places that take care of them after what they're called exactly but we can give them a list of stuff they need to do and my mom warned them not to give them iceberg lettuce like to their face and they still didn't died in while I was asleep was really sucky
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
I had a dog once, I still do.  
But I used to too.
Look at that cute  face!! You have to take her with you.
I'm not crying. I'm just cutting onions.
I hope you didn’t go anywhere. You monster !
That look of when we rolling out boss is to much.
Dog do be lookin kinda fresh doe
Are you going on a ***Guilt Trip?*** 😆
Oh my heart just skipped a beat. What a feeling? #emotionalmoment
Well, that's that OP, now you can't go.
Well I'm going to right hooman? You wouldn't leave me would you?
Scrolling by I thought the dog pooped in there.
We need to know where you're going and when you'll be back. That baby can't stand to see you leave :(
😩😭
When I travel I sometimes drive so I can take my dogs. Right now is a good example, we have been on a road trip for the past 3 weeks. When they see me packing they get all mopey. As soon as I say, “I’m taking you with me” the change is profound. I love my dogs.
“Hey, take this! It helps me during boring times, so must help you as well!”
This picture is so perfect. She’s not mad. She’s not excited. She just wants to know, “What’s the next fucking step, man?”
🤣🤣🤣🤣
She's ready to take a trip with you.
Included your pillow over the best girl ever??? 

Rude 😆
She knows, honey. She knows.
“Yo remember we gotta be at the airport at least an hour early.”
“I go with?”
You’d better be going on holiday and not leaving for good?!
Wow, that’s grade A prime 100% pure emotional manipulation 😅
I have 2 cats who don't exactly get along. I never really travel so since I've had them they never go a day without seeing me. Then I had to travel for 2 weeks and my friend watched them. 

When I walked in they were so happy. I put my stuff down and sat down in my chair. Both curled on me at the same time. They didn't move for 3 hours. That night I slept the same way. I gave them wet food for breakfast the next day. Never seen them happier. They also grew a bit i think. They get a bit more along now
Pets make going on vacation difficult.  Rolling your suitcase in and they pull this kinda shit to make you feel even more guilty.
Dogs been working on her gains.. she looks jacked
The same thing happened to me with a dog i had when i was a child. Only we didn't notice until we landed at our destination. I felt so sad for leaving him behind for over a week without his favorite toy.
Why is Bonnie wearing a sweater in summer?
“Don’t forget me when you meet new doggies on your journey. I love you human.”
Oh my got she has a sweater.
She is either trying to say, “It is dangerous out there hooman, take this!”

Or “You gonna take me with you.. right?”

Either way, it is activate the feels
why your dog wearing clothes?  Dogs don't need clothes, they have fur coat.
There is something about a dog in a homemade off the shoulder sweater that gets me everytime
ok but why did i thought that was one of its legs?
My dad's dog goes nuts when he brings out the suitcase. He even jumped into the car services car that came to pick my dad up. Dogs are great.
What is Bonnie wearing?? Lol
How sweet!!!
What breed is that Bonnie lass?
That face.. nope. You need to unpack almost immediately!
I wish our cats did this. Instead they pee on our suitcases when they realise we're going on vacation.
r/ntbdbiwdfta
I think I just heard my heart shatter inside of my chest.
Not as high of an aww level as your post, but on a few occasions when my dog wants to go out for a walk, he brings me his toy and immediately goes and sit down next to his leach. I think he practices basic economy when i’m not home.
She said "Me too!"
Oooooh, Bonnie McFurry
I saw the and thought the dog pooped in the suitcase
What a beautiful girl! What breed is she?
I love Bonnie
Aww, my chihuahua climbs on top/into the suitcase when I start packing it.
Oh, so you're going somewhere?
Without me?
Here's something to ease your thoughts while we're separated 💚
My cat somehow put his toy in my work bag when he was a kitten and now I take it to work every day.
Remind me when I packed a full duffle bag for a long trip and my dog also named Bonnie decided that's her new nesting spot
My mum's dog gets into the case and just lies there looking at you mournfully.
Look at my perfect life everyone. Even my dog does perfect things  and creates perfect moments so I can get perfect karma
Do you know what type of dog Bonnie is? My roommates dog is almost identical and isn’t sure his breed.
That is really precious! Now you have to take her with you!
Omg her little face and her little ears and her little sweater 😭
“Well, if you take my toy, then you’ll HAVE to take me too right???”
Love Bonnie 😍😍😍
Well Is She Coming!?
I have the same toy for my cats, they absolutely love it too
Why is your dog a better dresser than I am?
That dog look exactly like my dog and it kinda weird
Oh what a sweet puppy 🥰
Why tf does she have a shirt
"I'm ready for our byebye ride. Where we goin'?"
FWIW on the question of breed, we rescued a dog that looks a lot like yours and we DNA tested it. 75% American staffordshire terrier, 25% pit bull.


https://imgur.com/gallery/LrfBUlk
Reminds me of my kitty cat. Whenever I packed a suitcase I’d turn around and she’d jump in like “Take me to college with you!” God I miss her so much.
Don't forget me..
She looks almost exactly like a dog I had when I was younger. Does anyone know what breed this is? 

He was the best dog I've ever met.
Is it common to pack a pillow in a suitcase? 


What is this lifehack I know nothing of?
To the people who saying it’s too hot for a dog to wear a sweater,  y’all do realize that it is not summertime everywhere right now, don’t you?  It’s wintertime in the Southern Hemisphere.
It's dangerous to go alone, here take this!
Bonnie looks like me and every woman in America coming out of quarantine trying to squeeze into a sweater 2 sizes too small.
You better put a surprise for her in your suitcase when you come back
Black mouth cur? She looks like my dog lol
Bonnie I will come hang out with you!! Oh Bonnie sweet girl!
Yea, because she’s going with you.
"Oh f*ck off Rebbeca"
Like don’t go without me plz :(
Not gonna lie, for a split second I thought that was a big ol turd on the suitcase and that this was posted in r/animalsbeingjerks
How cute is this shit lol
This definitely 100% happened btw
Aww Bonnie is such a cutie she has to go with you!
When my dog sees an open, half-packed suitcase, she cuddles up inside it :/
OMG. She's so adorable!
Lol your dog is wearing the VKS.
You in trouble buddy. You'll need 1 bag for the dog to put all the other ones we won't know about
Don't worry, I'll come pick Bonnie up and keep her... Forever... Ahem I mean until you get back...
You’re lucky. My dog pees in my suitcase if I leave it open while packing.
How can you resist Bonnie!
Man, that's just terrible. That poor baby.
You better take her with you or else I'm calling 911
Forgot leaving her take her with you
“Here’s my favorite toy, take it with you so you don’t forget about me. I’ll be here.”
/R/thathappened
When I first looked at this, I thought the dog took a huge dump in the suitcase. Glad to see that is not the case.
She is adorable.  Do you know the breed?  She looks a lot like my friend's dog, a beagle-boxer mix.
Yea where you going that’s so important
Awwwww. Now you have to stay home. Sorry.
/r/RarePuppers
How do dogs and other pets know what a suitcase means?
What kind of dog is she?! Looks so much like mine
I thought it was a snicker doodle, the dog obviously loves you.
No proof the dog did it own her own. Probably fake
Why do you force your pet into clothes
I thought that was a doggy turd...
Hi, can you please tell Bonnie that I think she looks very lovely in her sweater? It’s very important. Thank you.
What breed is she?
It looks like you're taking a guilt trip...
Why is that dog wearing clothes? It’s June already.
I thought it was shit at first and that I was about to view a r/animalsbeingjerks post
Lol my dog looks exactly like that, she even makes the same face
/r/untrustworthypoptarts
I wouldn't be able to go without feeling guilty, but I go a bit overboard when it comes to my fuzzy family.
No she didn’t, you put it there for karma
Well i hope you took her otherwise you are a monster
She saying “please bring me momma I won’t be any trouble I promise” 😭😭😢
How did this end?
Man, those puppy dog eyes too. You have a heartbreaker!
Does anyone know what breed or mix of breeds she is? She’s beautiful 😍
Any chance you know what breed Bonnie is? My dog looks just like that but yellow and we can’t figure out what he is other than part lab.
Jajajaja!😁😆
Is that a virgin killer sweater on that dog
BONNIE, I LOVE YOU!
Aww she wants to go with you
That's her way of saying how awesome u are for packing your own pillow
There was once a man with integrity
Don't even think about saying you're not bringing Bonnie..
Pack the dog
I have to hide our suit case from our dogs when we leave.    My doofus head dog will absolutely freak out with the most heart wrenching screeches when he sees me packing any bag, even for a day trip.   W’ve always had someone stay at the house with our dogs, but it is not the same for him.
Anymore, we take them with us.    It’s horribly inconvenient to have 3 dogs in the car, but everyone is happy and we don’t spend the whole trip missing them. (We’ve been known to shorten our plans because we were worried about them).
WE DO NOT DESERVE DOGS
Looks like Rhodesian ridgeback mix?
Omg ik I say this a lot but that IS the cutest dog ever.
OMG I have to tell you this made me mist up, your dog looks so much like the dog I lost to cancer 2 years ago.

 I miss that dog she was the best damn dog I ever had, she loved everyone and everything.

&#x200B;

 You take care of that Pupper please.
Either she’s going with you or you’re not going
"You put all your stuffs in there, so my stuffs go too, right?"
"This is all I've got Jay!"
Why is your dog wearing a virgin killer sweater?
Her actions say “you’ll need this”, her eyes say “you’ll take me”
😫🥰😭
Sure...
Awwww!!! Her wants to go too! ❤️❤️❤️
r/thathappened
Please tell me you're not leaving Bonnie forever?!!
HER LIL SWEATER
Bonnie lookin hella sharp in that sweater.
One of my favorite stories about my mom's dog, Sweetheart, a poodle that my grandfather got for my grandmother and decided she was my moths dog:

My grandparents lived across the street from my greatgrandparents. Literally across the street. 

When my mom would start packing, Sweetheart would slyly crawl into the suitcase so that she could go. So my mom 'packed' 2 cases. The real one, and the one SH crawled into. She zipped it up while she packed, SH didn't let out a peep. She carefully picked it up, took it over to the GGPs house and left it there. Grama Lily said SH was *pissed*. When mom came back a week later, SH wouldn't even LOOK at her for like, 3 days, just sulked and stuck her nose up at the wall. 

Poodles are super smart dogs, my grampa got me a little mini poodle too, Angel, and I loved that doggo so much. She actually quit eating one summer when I went to visit my dad. :'( I missed her so much when I was gone.
Um, since you're taking her toy I guess you HAVE to take her too right? RIGHT!?
My Bonnie lies over the ocean  
My Bonnie lies over the sea

Sike lol he going to a kennel
Honestly thought she took a shit
Bless her pup 💕
Dogs are the best
She even got all dressed up for the vacation.
Awwwww!!! "I give you present if you stay at home...!"
Either “Hey, take this! It makes me happy and will make you happy!” Or “I’m coming too. Don’t leave me.”
This slays me. I’m devastated and I don’t know either of you. Mine just gets in the luggage herself; flying home to her right now.
How could you?
Can you share any notes on the book? Looks interesting.
Awwwww!  So smart!
Why you look sad ??
Gutted. Be strong brother. Keep telling her your coming back. Extra kisses for her
Oh my so cute!!!!
Sure she did Karen, sure.
My late Dalmatian used to get upset when he saw suitcases so we always had to secretly pack as to not upset him so much when any of us were going to travel and have to take him for a walk so guests would take their suitcases in. Such a dumb smart dog.
Looks like a dog bed under the strap anyway...
Let’s talk about bonnie’s very fashionable sweater...
Nice
You have to unpack immediately! You can't leave now
Is your dog wearing a Virgin Killer?
Look at that face!

You cannot go anywhere now!
My dog when I was growing up was called Bonnie.
It's dangerous to go alone.  
Take this.
Awwwww  she loves u as her bubbie!
"take this, it will keep you safe on your journey"
r/mademecry
Now you can’t leave.
What breed is she?!? I have a mut that looks very similar, but we have no idea what she is besides Rhodesian Ridge Back.
How cute.  My cats lay in mine. Then on top when I have it ready to go.  Animals know.
Potcake dog!
Video or didn’t happen?
I thought it was poop lol
And she's got her ears back giving you the big puppy dog eyes
Look at the sad little face :((
Bonnie, What a wonderful name.
“Sorry boss, cant make the conference. Something urgent has come up.”
My cat just kept lying down in the suitcase. Didn’t see him for a year. Came back for the holidays, he didn’t acknowledge that I was gone. Just came to me looking at me as if he was thinking: finally you’re here. Now feed me. I’ve been waiting.
My cat will lay down on my suitcase before I leave for trips.
Did you know that it is bad luck to give knives as wedding gifts?!  (Bad luck for the couple I presume...)
I definitely thought that was a big poop at first
My son’s cats get in his packed suitcase. The toy is precious!
At first I thought she pooped in your case.
She wants you to take some of her with you!
"So, where we goin'?!"
Stop it with that faaaaaaace 🤗😭🤗😭🤗
What a beautiful, sweet soul!!
My cat used to get all antsy when I'd bring the suitcases out and open them up on the bed. He'd be all over the place, jumping in and out, walking around, rubbing cheek, and meowing like crazy.

After a couple of such displays, I figured out that if I put two cans of catfood and the can opener beside one, he'd realize he wasn't going to be left behind this time. He'd shut up, wander over to his bed, flop down, and sleep the sleep of the just.

sooo cute
Empty ur suitcase n put him in he blends in with it 😂🤣🤣🤣
my German Shorthaired pointer/ Border Collie use to get in my suitcase while I was trying to pack. She got to go! When you own the company, you can designate bring your pet to work days!
The sweater
I'm thinking she's saying you can take this with you for your comfort.
Our pup would do the same with his favorite plushy. He intended to go with his pack no matter what, when or where.
What does all of the stars mean
You are so lucky, cats don’t bring their favorite toy, they just barf!
Every time I start to get ready to leave the house my dog grabs his leash and it makes me so sad to tell him he can’t go with me :(
I dont give a shit if ur going on the business trip to save the world that dog is going with u
Your dog is my dog’s doppelgänger.
Bonnie wants you to have it for your trip
Awww. We don’t deserve dogs. ❤️
Oh the onions have been cut!
Someone is asking for an upgrade!! Love the toy!!
Look how proud she is
OMG....right in the feels....she looks identical to my best buddy who is no longer with me. What breed is she? I have been trying to find another buddy.
That look melted my heart. Bonnie is so adorable.
Dude.. I feel you. When I use to leave for college my dog would leave her treats that I have been giving her.. once back to college it was such a heartache not seeing her. Now she lived with me :)
And that face! omg, how could you ever leave!
You’re her Clyde 😭
Excuse but who does her pedicure 💅
My brother’s dog is also named Bonnie XD
Hey! I have a Bonnie, too!

She’s a Bonnie Lil Lassie!
Love his sweater

Or you placed it there and took a picture for fake internet points 🤡
There are no kinder souls in the universe than that of a dog. They are the closest creatures to God.
Get that dumb shirt off that poor dog lol
At first glance I thought it was a strangely formed dog shit.
Nice
Imagine putting clothes on your dogs.
Please tell me your dog is not wearing a virgin killer....please...
are you okay, cause that would break my heart if puppers wasnt going...
fake
Never fly with your pet, leave it at home.  Don't be the asshole that forces the rest of the plane to deal with your dog.
Looks kinda like a bootleg elwetritsch
I'm not trying to be that guy, but is the sweater in doors really necessary? I really hope your dog isn't overheating, they have fur coats for a reason.  
 
She is a dog, not your child. I really hate when people put clothing on their pets just because it makes them look cute.
Take that stupid clothing off that dog. Fuckwit.
