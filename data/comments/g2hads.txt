How long did it take for the trust to build here?
Now this is some high quality catfishing.
"Okay now I want to go back down again."

"No actually I've change my mind. Up please."

"Wait, down. I said down! That's what I said!"

>You said up

"Okay, up again then."

"Down."
And the cat's in the cradle
Cats don't have owners, they have staff.
This could end badly like in Rear Window. Make sure your neighbors are single or in happy marriages.
I'd be too nervous to use a hook.
This is how I just got my package from the fedex guy.
The stairs are for my human slaves.
How many cats did he go thru before he got it right ?
Yo The whole I was scared they were gonna drop it by accident 🤣 it’s genius tho seriously bro
I tried doing this with my little sister one time. It didnt work but now she has a cool electric chair she uses everyday
DONT DROP DA KITTY
Rapunzel let down your hair
Confidence and trust is total.
Please tie that straight onto the handle rather than just hook it
they cut out the part where the cat wanted to go back down a minute later.
Someone's watched "Rear Window" ;-)

I wish my cat would do this
This may be one of the cutest things I've ever seen
This is the kind of person that would build a cat lift in their free time...and I respect him for that
And that is why its a chonker
What a brave cat
That cat's clearly used to doing that. It's so trusting.
It places the lotion in the basket...
PUSS......in a basket
This is definitively northern Italy.
Now the quest begins to see who posted this first
My dumbass cat would try to jump out near the top
This can't be right.  Any self-respecting cat would have hopped right back in the basket and wanted to go back down.
That's... actually pretty clever. Might be better to have a bigger basket and a pully system, though.
Atleast change the hook to a carabiner...I don't even like cats but...that hook looking sketch as fook.
At first i tought those were balloons and He/she/you missed him/her and he/she would have flown into space. Not first cat tho.
Modern problems, modern solutions..
Thank you peasant
He only gets to shift his weight wrong 8 times
I love how the cat overlord doesn't even deign to look at the human peasant who just carried him up.
r/mypeopleneedme
I'd be afraid of my cat freaking out and jumping.
This is the most Turkish thing I have ever seen, haha :D
"Hey Nermal, want to play astronaut?"
I was expecting her to walk out of the basket and walk back into it to go back down.
I'd be concerned for this cat except that my cat once fell from 3 flights up at our old apartment complex. She'd somehow gotten locked outside and attempted to jump through our open window, missed, landed on her feet (of course) and then waited there meowing until I came and got her.

Had her looked at and she had the tiniest cut on her nose... that's it.

Cats are insane.
So trusting, on both ends.
That's dangerous to be honest. One small mistake and the cat gets injured.

O Rapunzel... let down your baaaskettt
That is a trustful cat right there, lol
cat fur can also work as a carrier for corona virus
He could also set up a pulley system to shorten the draw, and cats are light so the additional force needed wouldn’t be that great.
Cats are way smarter than I think studies show. 

I have seen FAR too many cats pass the mirror test and object permeance on both Reddit and real life. 

They seem to be aware of how things work at a basic level too. 

I wish we could know for sure.
Pretty ingenious way you found to steal cats there. This will come in handy when the freezer is empty.

How to get a free cat
Rear Window
I like how he keeps the rope/hook separate from the basket for all that multi purpose hooking he has to do

Where are we going and why am I in this handbasket?
I do not trust my cat wouldn’t have tried jumping out
Don't do this with your dog, it won't end the same way.
Good human ♥️
Plot twist: This isn't his cat. He just stole a cat.
Watched rear window a few nights ago, this is actually possible?! Cute cat btw
Love how the cat trusts the hooman fully and isn’t scared
CAT IN DA BASKET

WHERE HE GOIN
Rear window...
I would not trust my cat not to jump out half way up. Lil dumb ass.
I'll bet this is Turkey.
When his tail hit the fence I was worried he was going to jump out
Never gonna lift you up.......
thats called trust
Cats never fail to amaze me. Sheesh.
That seems pretty dangerous to me. Haha I wouldn’t do it with my dog because he’d jump out of the basket half way up.
My cat would immediately jump out. Either that or wait until he’s just high enough to make me shit myself but not high enough to get hurt.
This makes me so nervous watching
My cat would jump out at the halfway point.
My only problem with this is that the hook itself could be used more securely. If you wrap the rope around the hand and let the hook grab onto the rope, it's less likely to slip off the handle while pulling it up.
This reminds me of the Garfield movie
Just Turkish things.
If they tried that with a dog they'd fall out on the first pull.
Probably gets back in the basket a second later and demands to go back down...
ReBeL cAt EsCApES qUarAnTiNe!!!!!!!!!!!
How do you teach this? How do you train your cat for the first time??
Saved my cat from a tree using this method. She climbed WAY up in woods that no bucket truck or ladder was getting too. Tied a wrench to a rope, there it over the beach she was on, pulled the basket up to her. She figured it out quick, got in, and I lowered her down. Took about 2 hours.
This is how I get new cats, too!
Gets an upvote from me purely for the fact that op didn’t write “Hooman” Thanks op, have a great day 👍
That can't be safe...
People praising it must know how unsafe it is to tow your pet like this.
Kitties are so smart.
Use a metal bucket instead.

Wicker can break.

And there's no worse of a feeling than accidentally killing you pet which that dude clearly seems to care for.
Omg I love this, deserves a million upvotes.
My heart dropped when I saw the hook. I'd be happy to donate an old locking carabiner
Personally I think this was a stupid idea that put the cat at risk of injury. All it would take is the balance of the basket to shift and it would tip.
That is cute but isn't that risky?
I feel like there should be two handles where the hook attaches to for better balance. 

All I could think was how badly this could be if the basket tipped in either direction.
I was scared for the kitty. Thought he jumped into basket about ready to take a adventure balloon ride.
That only works because the cat is balancing it out. Just a little too much weight on one side and it flips
According to a study done by The Journal of American Veterinary Medical Association, cats falling from an average of 5.5 stories and as high as 32 stories (more than enough to hit  terminal velocity of 60 mph) had a survival rate of 90 per cent. He'll be ok and his calm in the basket is because he knows his limits I think.
That cat is fearless

Oh my gAwd!! 😱so incredibly sweet!
Keep an eye on your neighbors' Rear Window
I need sound, to know if the cat meows to summon the lift!
Needs a pulley.
Nice
Looks super fun and relaxing ha! 👍
Aaawwww
My Cat would hate that!! He hates ups.
gif ends too soon. assuming the cat doesnt actually go inside and turns around and gets back in the basket?
I was very concerned for a moment, and then I saw that the cat was in a basket and not a leash or something.
My calico would totally be down for this
Cat: Oh I don't know how you do that everyday. It looks absolutely exhausting... 

Human: Oh it's nothing, really. 

Cat: Then I don't know why it takes so long!
That transport took a while, have you tried re-aligning your transport buffers?
I wonder how much training went into this, like did the cat show up in the ground floor and the owner just improvised the basket and hook thing, or did the owner carry the cat around the flat in the basket to get it used to it?
Just like in the movie Rear Window, but a cat. Watch out for a Raymond Burr copycat.
I love how the cat just steps out and casually walks off
This cat is way too comfortable
Mine would defo launch itself out half way.
I feel like i'd want two anchor points on that basket for stability.
Dad: “I don’t want a cat..”

Actually no episodes of starcat contain the phrase beam me up human. It's 'human beam me up'
For a second, I thought the hand was a balloon and that I was watching some sort of live action Pixar film.

I tried to do this with my cat when I had a tree house when I was little. She was so scared that when I go her up to the house and took her out of the basket she had pooped in it :(
Cats have all the fun.
Now imagine the cat falling...
Reminded me of one of the cats I've had. When our oldest cat was younger she'd climb on top of a fireplace that's like 3m tall. After finishing her nap there she'd meow loudly and we had to always bring her down with a basket. She absolutely refused to jump back down and demanded her personal elevator service.
I'm entertained by the shadow more than I should be.
or, you know, you could keep your cats inside
Not even a thank you!
Aww bless
I have never had a cat that would utilize this. One was a paranoid coward, the other was a furry little moron, who couldn't sit still
Has no one seen The Rear Window??
My cat would have jumped half way up. And then looked at me like I'm the idiot.
This is not r/aww at all. This is some r/SweatyPalms or r/maybemaybemaybe
This is how he's been feeding himself
How uncouth. He didn't even tip that elderly elevator operator.
If the cat fells, this would've been on another subreddit
“Mr. Stark?! I’m being beamed up!”
Drop.
Just like in Rear Window!
I thought they were being lifted by a balloon and it gave me so much anxiety o.o
My cat claimed a square hard bottomed grocery bag awhile back and he'll jump inside and start meowing expectantly until one of us comes and picks the bag up and flies him around the apartment.
"Thank you human... Now feed me."
My cat likes to get high too.
Haha
Both hilarious and wholesome

When I was staying at a hostel in Lisbon, there was a crazy cat lady on the other side of an empty lot in the back. Everyday at sunset we would gather for drinks and appetizers, and we would all watch her lower food and water over a 20ft wall to help a dozen or so feral cats. It was pretty cool to see someone so caring and dedicated to helping those kitties
Absolutely

Theres no situation where my cat would trust me enough to do this.
😳
Yeet
Is that Ulla Britta?? lol
That cat is much smarter than the cat that got stuck in my chimney. Wake up and hear meowing. Wake up roomie asking if he got a cat, nope. Search the house till we realize it’s comin from the damn wall. Chimney was non functional and mostly bricked up. Just a tiny slit you could see a cat that has fallen in the top. 
 

Naturally we called the fire dept who laughed and said they only get them out of trees. Not really. We couldn’t get a hold of anyone. 

Plan b was to lower an empty paint can we had tied rope to. The cat wouldn’t get in. Even when we put a can of tuna in it. It didn’t help that the cat was so fat it took up the whole space and the can kinda just landed on him. 

Ended up spending the day chipping and the chimney and drinking until we broke a hole big enough to get her out. 

TL;dr lost our deposit but saved a fat cat who was too stupid to climb into a tuna filled paint can
Do you think the cat that arrives up top is technically the same cat that went in?
I love it when I think I'm on r/yesyesyesno but am really on r/aww. I'm pleasantly surprised by the happy ending instead of a horrible tragedy.
I can't with cats 🤣🤣 I swear the rule us
A davit arm and a pulley would help this immensely.
I hope somebody knows what I'm talking about, but this reminds me of that level in Pajama Sam where he had to be raised into the treehouse by throwing rocks into a basket.
Like they say. Dogs have owners, cats have staff.
It's amazing what cats are willing to learn to avoid spending energy :)
Cats can be trusting and intelligent when they want to be, they just choose not to a lot of times :p
I did this once with my cat. He didn't get in willingly tho.
Isn’t that super unsafe & they could get the cat killed?
Next, a balloon and a tag line.

My mom told stories about how when she was young she was allowed to have a cat but the cat wasn't allowed to be in the house.  Her bedroom was upstairs while the rest of the bedrooms were downstairs, so she'd lower a basket to the ground, her cat would climb in, and she'd bring it up through the window.  It's nice, this is the first time I've seen this actually done on the Internet :)
This gave me anxiety
This belongs in r/SweatyPalms

Was really hoping the basket would tip over, or the rope would snap, could have been a good video then
And now, dinner is served.
That is an awesomely well trained cat. My cats would have no part of that shit!!
So cool!
What if that cat jumps half way through?
It's cute but, at the same time, it's kinda dangerous...  Nevermind, cats always land on their feet.
.. What if the rope snapped after he was like... In the middle of the air
That hook looks awfully sharp, is this really safe?
Sorry, I don't like this. I find it highly dangerous.
I’d be scared to drop my stupid ass cat.
but what if you dropped him 🥺🥺
Risk vs reward not worth
Further proof that cats are liquid, time to find me-self a kitty well!
Can they at least not connect it by a hook but something like a carabinier so it doesn't slip
Cats do threat their slaves nicely
That’s so irresponsible
That construction seems kinda.. suspicious..
This is so clever! A quarantine friendly way to ensure your furbaby gets her outside time!

Bold moving having the basket just on a hook without a tied knot
First I'm like "fuck that's dangerous".

Then I'm like "oh, it's a cat. Never mind, they're liquid."
This absolutely terrifies me, I could never try to do this. I would only do this if the rope was connected in four places, and the rope was on a pulley or better yet a double pulley. I would not want that cat to fall or even teeter, even though cats have exceptional balance.
Zombie proof!!
[removed]
For what its worth its less destructive than using a teleporter because you don't get destroyed in the process and your copy gets to live on with the rest of your life and memories.
What happens if the cat falls out?
The basket didn't flip over ONLY because of the cat. The creature puts quite an effort to balance it.

Edit grammar.
Stupid and risky. Lazy owners putting their cat in danger cause they don't want to use the stairs.
That thing is gonna fly out and die one of these fuckin days

Keep your damn cats indoors.  They’re terrible for the environment
Someone get the man a carabiner
Go shit in the neighbors yard
Until he hits the basket with the tip of his slippers.  Yikes.
That cat should be taking the stairs.
That's awesome. I would definitely invest in a better hook though.
That hook is a little dangerous, no?
My cat would jump down anyway if saw some fucking  insect
*rope snaps*
That hook though...
With just a hook keeping that basket from falling means bumping something that would shift weight around could get that basket off the hook.
Dqal
Hook too small, tie the damn rope to the basket!
Oh paleeze!
/r/OSHA would have a fit
I would definitely want a pulley system for this, in case my clumsy ass dropped the rope.
CHONK
Imagine him dropping the basket. I'd have some extra food for quarantine
Do it a little more safe even cats can survive falls ok?
Great way to risk murdering your pet.
