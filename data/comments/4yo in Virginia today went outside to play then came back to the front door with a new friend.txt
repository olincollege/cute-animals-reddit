I actually heard this on the radio LOL. The mother said that the boy talked to the young fawn and told him that he has cereal inside. So they went inside for some cereal then she said that she told her son to take him back outside to the tree line that his mother would be looking for him. So they ate some cereal then he walked him outside to the tree line.
Imagine the reaction of the other mom, when her baby showed up with a tiny human.
Deer looks like that friend who had you ask their mom if it’s okay if he can stay at your house for the night. Lmao
Got yourself Disney Royalty right there.
When you're stoned and accidentally bring home the wrong dog.

(This actually happened to a friend of mine)
I was just going to say how wonderful to see the PJs/ jacket combo (with boots as well)! Love it.
Stop. How cute is this?!? That deer looks like he’s saying ‘can I come in and play?’ I love everything about this, thanks for sharing!!
I love how they both look non challant. Like this is totally normal. Lol
Just don't let that thing in the house. They will wreck your shit. My cousin had one, and it terrorized the neighborhood. Tldr, children are cute but be careful
Mother deer usually leave their fawns alone in a safe spot while foraging. It looks like lil Steve Irwin here found one such fawn. 

That’s my guess but who knows?  Either way, this kid has a cool story to tell with pictures to back it up.  

When I was four, I was DESPERATE to be friends with the birds that landed at our bird feeder.  Did not work out. I terrified them. It also doesn’t help that I didn’t know how to whistle at the time so I just made the highest pitch noise I could and ran at them. 

What were we talking about?

Edit: I changed “dear” to “deer” because I am big brain.

Another fucking edit: It’s been a long time since I talked about deer.  I typed “deers” instead of “deer”, and I am laughing my ass off. I needed a chuckle this morning.
Tick check!
I had a pet deer growing up. Her name was Jane Doe. I use to live on a farm with my Mom in Maryland. My stepdad was cutting the edge of the field by the road. He ran over the baby fawn nipping the top of it's head (nothing serious). The mother deer was dead on the side of the road after being struck by a car. So my mom bottle feed this fawn for the first few months, she lived in the house with us. Was like a puppy really. once it became old enough she tried to release it back into the wild but every morning Jane would be sleeping on our back porch. After days of this we put her in a 5 acre enclosure where she lived her best life passing away just last year. She was 12.

I'll find a picture of her in a few.

Edit: [almost a year](https://imgur.com/a/EqppToF)
You've got a druid.
Look at their faces! Adorable cute little things. 😍
This reminds me of when I was about 8 and came home with a red squirrel.

I was sent to my grandmother's who lived down the street. She thought she caught a bat under a garbage pail in the basement. Because I was always trying to make friends with animals and creepy crawlers everyone assumed I was the right person to help. When I got there and lifted the pail the cutest little fuzzy thing (must have been a baby that just left the nest) was standing up looking back at me. I scooped it up, pet it and put it in my t-shirt pocket. We bonded instantly and it would follow me around and sleep in my pocket.

I wanted to keep it so badly but we had a cat and clearly any sane parent would not let their child keep a squirrel as a pet. I kept it for about two weeks and I was forced to relinquish it to an animal sanctuary that rehabilitated and released them in the wild if the could (which I'm assuming my parents had to pay for but I was 8 so I honestly have no idea).

I always think about them and hope they had a kick as squirrel life.

Edit: changed a typo, from best to nest.
Oh deer.
*mom I got a pony!*
Man, deer are surprisingly curious animals.  I WFH in a rural area, surrounded by deer.  They constantly are looking in my window while I work... no more than 4 feet away from me with they nose prints sliming up my window.   
I'm a software dev and I constantly think they're judging me - "*dude, you aren't going to use a double when an int would work, right?  Moron!*"
Idk how to explain it but they both have the same innocent smile on their faces
Not going to try scare anyone but try to be safe while around deer. CWD [(Chronic wasting disease)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_wasting_disease) hasn't jumped to humans yet thankfully but if you are in contact CLEAN YOUR HANDS or LEAVE THEM ALONE.
10 years later... A forest fire! The boy, now 14, comes out of house to see. A young stag bolts out of the flames. "Nick, it's you! No time to explain! Get on!"
Reminded me of when I was 6yo and i had a stray cat friend. I could even slide with her on sleds when it snowed.
Judging by the pyjamas, that’s Rudolph
My wife has a deer she talks to.  The deer keeps walking through our yard and likes to normally stay about 3m away, but has occasionally come up and touched her.

We never ever feed it.
Sure looks like a beginnings of a historic slumber party.
Is no one even going to mention the synergy that this kid is wearing Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer PJs?!
Oh deer, if I only had a buck every time this happened.
This will set forth a lifetime of having special connections with animals. When I was younger I would hang out outside playing with the deer while my mom cleaned for work. After that I continually had interesting sometimes hard to explain interactions. Had a turkey in a wildlife exhibit fall in love with me. 4 years later when I went back to visit it, it remembered me almost immediately and acted the same. Most recently I've gotten into photography and I've had squirrels and a beaver hang out with me and let me take pictures. The beaver was by far the coolest, seemed extremely calm and potentially even nice. Let me sit just a couple feet away and take pictures while he walked around me keeping the same distance. It was hard to focus on taking pictures and not just living in that amazing moment, luckily it lasted a good hour. You've got a special kid there.
This is adorable. But isn’t this how you catch lime disease?
"Where are the raisins? The little girl told me there would be raisins."
The pajamas have a Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer as the theme! Deer musta known boy was a friend!
Check everything for ticks
I honestly think kids have magic power and we lose it at puberty. This is so cool
"Can we keep it?"
Can she sleep over
Hello, I would like to talk about your cars extended warranty
THEY ARE BOTH JUST LIL BABIES WHO WANT TO PLAY OMG.

&#x200B;

sorry.
Is no one going to mention how adorable that child is?  I mean, fawn are always cute, but that little boy is darling.  He and his fawn can come into my house anytime.
Seems like your kid has a case of Disney Princess
The 4 y/o brought home friends... The amount of tics on that deer is a party by itself
Disney Prince in the making here.
You gotta boop that snoot before he leaves, for the good luck.
And now the boy has disappeared after walking the fawn home and is currently enjoying a bowl of deer food with the deer family
They have the same eyes 😍
That kid might be a disney princess.
For some reason just the photo really tickles my lovey fuzzy spots.    Just like how other animals will interact and take care of others young. Children are so precious so pure. My own anxiety would have had that deer running off asap. Children are so pure, literally just beaming out love vibes that the pure innocent world can pick up on.   Making waves kid making waves.
Innocence begets innocence.  We all have it and life slowly drains it from us.  When we lose it, we can't Disney-Princess walk our way to fawns and other animals.  Both these kids have it.  You can see it and they exude it.  When you're entirely innocent, you have no idea what it means to question trust. You just trust. They trust. 

This is the most beautiful thing I'll see all day. Probably all week. I'm literally in love with this. 

(Also, my lack of innocence these days tells me that there is a chance this fawn could be an orphan, with the fawns survival instinct leading to trusting the child.)
If those two showed up at my doorstep, I would buy whatever they were trying to sell me.
So we’re skipping over the fact that this child somehow convinced a deer to walk to her house, possibly speaking deer.....
That is the coolest thing ever. How awesome is that.
The dear is messing sure she’s home safely.
Put that thing back where it came from, or so help me
“Hello, apparently this is happening and I’m your new child now. Got any snacks?” This is just adorable
They're the same size it's so fucking cute
Sounds like the deer in my neighborhood. They turned our Jack o’lanterns into an all you can eat buffet. Took the pumpkin right out of my hand.
Wish my daughter bright groceries home more often
/s
This is super cute
>Yes... hi... this small human said there would be cookies.  I would like them now.  Please and thank you...

-- That Fawn
Just the cute I needed this morning.
Check for ticks
Who’s watching this kid lol
I get the feeling they've been chosen for a quest.
I'm friends with his mom, I text her and tell her "someone got paid on reddit from that thing about your son" she says "how do you know they got paid???" Lol.
This is how our world is supposed to be.
What a beautiful child.   He has a good heart.

&#x200B;

That deer...
I feel like this picture was taken be the fawn's family in the house. Deer dad: "Oh god! Honey! He brought another kid! People can't know we live in houses really! He needs to stop befriending little hoomans"
How heartwarming
He’s wearing Rudolph the red nose reindeer PJ’s.  Case closed.
And his friend brought a million friends with him!
That is clearly a fawn. Certainly not 4 years old, probably about 4 to 6 months.
He's been blessed by the forest spirits. They will have many great journeys, though he will be changed forever. Godspeed young druid.
I hope that “new friend” isn’t Lyme Disease.  People really need to stop putting their children and pets at risk for Reddit upvotes .  (Downvote to your hearts content, but I stand by this post.)
lyme
Ticks. Ticks, everywhere.
🥺
The look on that little girls face is priceless
Deer are very sociable if they have been around humans long enough. My dad works outside on a college campus and they have wild deer that roam around, and they like to come up to humans for snacks. My dad likes to feed them with apples they cant reach off the trees, and they will come right up to him.
Hey I found a dog can we keep it
Bro this kid the rl dr doo little and cute
Oh deer
This happened to me once when I was a kid. Now it’s still happening but with squirrels and chipmunks.
Wow 1k awards
Please show a follow up on this great relationship.
How???
When you find out your 4yo is a Druid
*When you roll a nat 20 on your charisma check*
Watch out for ticks.
I love picturing these two little precious babies wandering up to eachother and just deciding they're friends now. Must have been a special moment for the both of them! 

Also that wholesome grin and those TINY HOOVES are going to get me through the day today :)
Am I the only one who knows lyme disease is a thing and is uncomfortable here?
That new friends name? Lyme disease.
This is cute and all but also bad for the deer
Deer,:she said food
Girl: nooo! (Winks at deer)
Is that Bambi?
Snow White in the house!
“Sooo the kid here says you have cookies?”
Doh!
Love how the kid is still in his pyama with boots on
That kid’s name is now Radagast.
Heidi girl of the alps vibes
Every hunter:its free real estate
They are both adorable! Please check every millimeter of that child for ticks!
Better check that kid for ticks!
I see deer people. Walking around like regular people. They like cereal. They don't know they're deer.
Wholesome. And now I want a bowl of cereal
This is cute af
Watch out for Lyme's disease
Oh dear
Puppy
How beautiful, so lucky to be this close to nature xxx
Fawns are weird that way. They'll just follow you around. Their mothers will leave them to forage, and they'll stay put until they find someone else to latch on to.
They have the same eyes and expression. Soul mates!
Does anybody notice this babie Rudolph pajamas too?!?
this is it. this is the cutest thing i'll ever see.
Awn this looks like a Disney movie
How cute 😍😍😍
Did he know what he got himself into doe?
Very cute, Check for ticks 🙏
This is so cute
Pretty much adorable! 😊
The deer whisperer
As a kid I fed them potato chips.
I cast Animal Friendship.
You live in a Disney movie and are blessed with a sweet and gentle child.
They look like they’re about to ask if the other can sleep over
That's little baby snow white
This is the most adorable photo ❤️
I thought he understood when I told him to not bring humans at our house, damn it
Lil dude has deer on those sweet 'jamas - I'm sure the dear deer knew it was in solid hands there.
The optimist in me says this is adorable. 

The pessimist in me says his has Lyme disease written all over it.  😕
Jesus christ I am up way too early, I initially read “4yo virgin”....yikes
The Deer Whisperer
Did you feed them both? They look hungry...

"Mom? Can we have something to eat?"
Kids a Druid
The dear is just like: she can keep me right?
Gotta be careful, the deer might tell the kid to come to their house.
Unfortunately now the fawn will smell like human and the mama bird will push it out of the nest :(
the little baby deer sure has a pair of thin legs
Aw the kid's face. And the deer's face too <3
Is your kid a Disney character? Lol
"I was told there would be corn?"
This reminds me of the time we let a squirrel in the house. Her name was broke tail.
Mom can my friend sleep over? Can he can can he??
Both sharing the same look: "You got any food in there?"
Congratulations, the child is a druid.
God forgive me for reading it as Virgin
You know the rules...now you gotta keep it.
Cute, but that kid is one tick away from lyme disease
The little boy is wearing Rudolph pj’s— the deer knew he could trust him.
Don’t deers have ticks that carry Lyme disease?
It's all fun and games till you go through a road surrounded by the woods.
Disney wants to know your location
Ticks and fleas and lyme disease. Be careful.
I was in love with this pic.  And then I audibly gasped And freaked out over the Rudolph Jam Jams! Squeeeeee!
#If the boy is cold then the deer is cold

#Let the baby deer inside
All fun an games until someone catches Lime disease
First thought: 'Awww, that's really cute!'

Second thought: 'Wait, if momma deer had been around she could've killed or seriously injured that kid!'
They both look equally expectant about coming inside.
1. Ticks & Lyme disease
2. CWD
3. Not sure an apparently unattended child would do great against a mother deer protecting their fawn.

Far more anxiety inducing than cute, in my opinion.
CWD
Sooo 👀 no one was watching the 4 yr old
Kids a Disney princess. How much more proof do you need?
Mom can I have a popsicle for me and a bag of oats for my new friend?
Watchout for ticks!
So how much disney did you watch while the kids was in utero? You know for science.
“Mom, he says he’s here to talk to you about your car’s extended warranty....”
Don’t forget to check for ticks!!!
They have the same energy
Does your child happen to be a Disney princess?
This is it. This is the childhood picture your Mom presents to your first loveinterest and you are EVERYTHING but ashamed. "This? Yeah this me. Whenever I was bored I'd make a new deer friend. Sometimes racoons, too. But never beavers. Pretentious little shits. Always busy for the "greater Wood". Hated em. "
The holiness
Aww omg i love this ❤️❤️
“If I could talk to the animals...”
Jane Doe !
The cuteness in this pic is overwhelming
that doggy has some very skinny legs!
Awesome 🙂
Is this kid fae?
*g r i n *
A Disney princess in the making
They might be a Disney princess

Funny looking dog
Totally nominating them for 2024.
Virginia really is a magical place, isn’t it? :)
Your kids a Druid
Definitely a Hufflepuff
This is a classic can I keep him mom
Biggest Aww Ever!!
Look like the face you make when you ask you mom if you can spend the night at your friends place lol! So cute!
So I tried to paint this adorable pic. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/l7najw/deer\_friend\_me\_acrylic\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/l7najw/deer_friend_me_acrylic_2021/)  


I know it's not that good but I wish I could send it to this kid as a gift.  Maybe OP can help me regarding this.
Why did she brought us food
Same facial expression.
This picture is killing me! Like some fairy tale became real.
That's actually cute
Gregory Peck would like to know your location
And then Dad walked over with a hammer...
I lived in Central Virginia for a while, these critters are everywhere and goddam was the roadkill in that state epic. Cute story though.
Amazing and heart warming.
Awwww
Wow cool he find a  friend
Beautiful innocence
They are royalty
Thats is so cute and the look on both faces are priceless.
"mommy, I brought home dinner!"
So cute
This is just peaceful and beautiful to make such a unique friend in the nature.
Omg. This is way too cute. Like, way too cute. 😍😭
Instead of Fred Bear its Fred Deer 😄😄
If I don't get an update in 10 years about how they're best friends, I'm gonna lose it
Totes asorbs.
I want to eat it
You ever get that feeling when you meet someone and instantly feel like you’ve known them forever?  I think this is what that looks like, at least how I picture it. They are young stewards of the planet, THIS is how we all get along. But enough about that, my only gripe is that someone had better tell them to stop being adorable, I don’t want out universe to implode.
Awww
She lured in that night's dinner.
AWWWW
Just like Bambi
You guys know she asked if she could keep her.
the newest disney movie
Strong Audrey Hepburn vibes
Might have the fawn checked for CWD!
I mean....no.  Wild....animal.  

WILD

Have more respect for nature.  It's cute and all, but just no.  Never approach a baby wild animal.  You never know what the mother will do.  Mothers protect their young.  This is how you end up with a kid getting kicked in the head.
Alright, Reddit, tell me why this cute moment isn’t safe.
Your daughter is Snow White. Beware of apples.
[removed]
Stop feeding animals.
gotta be careful the mother coulda rammed her. wonder if she was abandoned or lost tho.
Are you sure it's a 4 year old? I feel like most deer are bigger than that by age 4.
Reminds me of an episode of This American Life where two sisters kidnap a baby deer and put him in their high school musical. Not quite as magical as this but a good story. 

https://www.thisamericanlife.org/482/lights-camera-christmas/act-two-8
Make sure both of you sign up to get your vaccine!
That friend?

Lyme disease
...and lyme disease?
I was looking for this comment! I thought maybe I was the only one wondering about ticks.
Rabies.
Well, that kid has Lyme now.
That deer is nowhere near 4 years old.
No way that fawn is 4 years old.
And lyme disease
Not safe
Are deer safe to hang around? I was always wary about getting too close to them when running.
Great photo!
Lyme disease! Fun for the whole family!
Check that kid for Lyme disease. The deer doesn't seem weird, but they got ticks
Watch out for ticks.  Winter doesn’t get rid of them...

And they can transmit Lyme disease.
Pure. So pure. Can't get purer than this
D’oh! A deer!
Are you going to keep him?
I don't know who is cuter
I think someone might be looking for that kid.
Oh my!!! This is awesome!
...*a deer whisperer*...
The call of the wild!!! Lol
This is so adorable and it made my day
Lol this is just a really cool picture. I would love to see the initial meeting. Little Bambi just loving it up
Cute fawn. What's the name of the kid he brought home? :)
“Can we have snacks?”
I'm jealous!  I've always wanted to befriend a deer!
“Mommy! Can we keep it?!”
“Mom, can my friend come play inside!?”
I hope the Mommy Deer accept the cute wild animal.
I heard you give away free snack here!
“We want a snack”
“Y’all got snacks?”
"Mom, can we keep him?"
Love the PJs. Such a wholesome warmth
It followed me home Mummy. Can I keep it?
You have two dears!
Cool dog. What race?
Hello, yes I’d like to be adopted.
I live in northern VA. On a typical day we have 10-20 of these in our back yard. Place is over run with deer. Deer ticks and lyme disease.  It's all cuteness until you get up close to them and see the infestation.  We can't let our dog roam in the back because he comes back with two or three ticks each time. Hunger is driving them to back doors because people feed them. It's a real problem here.
“Can we keep him?”
Dad, can meet friend come for tea?

Yeah, who's your friend?
I love deer, theyre so damned adorable, i long for the day i get to pet and feed one
 Nice to meet your new friend. 

When you come in, you are free, 

but when you go out, you are not.
Oh yes a young Druid in training
I wonder if the deer will be back.
Looks like a cutie battle to me. They both win first prize.
r/wholesome
"Hi. This little person told me there would be food around here."
A tiny Brother Nature
Wow look at that dog!
Hopefully he’s not a deer with the zombie deer virus.
wholesome!
They both have a look of “okay mom, but seriously, where’s the food?”
Who you callin scruffy lookin?
Pure innocence, the wonders of life.
good people are good with animals :)
“Mum can my friend stay overnight?”
The deer when it heard cereal REEEEEEEE TAKE ME THERE NOW HUMAN
What if the roles were reversed and the doe took the 4 year old into the forest to meet its parents?
Who keeps leaving kids in the wild
you befriended a human, you stupid fawn.
Just go to Old Forge NY and you can feed as many deer as you'd like. They're pretty much just dogs.
Max? Max Caulfield?
"Mom can he sleep over?"
What's for lunch?  Corn?
The mom in me is having trouble with the pj's and unzipped coat....but otherwise this is totally adorable
How cute!! I’m also in VA and my pup is having a blast in the snow! Happy to see your baby making some pretty awesome memories!
I am jealous!!!!!
Hes so cute!!! 

Deer's are so cute, especially that little boy!
Wassup, can a loc come up in yo crib?
I dont trust friendly deer since finding out about the zombie deer disease
My wife calls me deer. But doesn’t bring cereal. I don’t hear her so well.
“My mom said it was ok if I stayed the night”
That deer looks totally comfortable and ready to play some nintendo.
This child looks so pleased
My new friend here said something about seed.

Allow me to introduce myself...
What kind of dog is that?
As a Southerner, when I saw the kid's boots all I could think was, "JESUS CHRIST. IS THAT KID FROM THE FUTURE?"

In Bill Burr's voice, of course.
That's a fluffy deer
Omg besties!
Ma'am your son is the new Disney Prince. Congratulations.
And Lyme disease
If you give a deer some cereal.....
He bring new friend at home what a friendly child!
Deer even knows to wipe his feet
Thats a good dog
Canela?
Someone's son is a Disney prince in disguise as a 4 year old. 

What a cute picture. Fawn is like "hey, can I come in and hang?"
what a couple of cuties awesome, wish I had wildlife around my home town.
He's gonna need about tree fiddy.
OMG how adorable!
-mommy, can we keep it?
that's a Disney movie right there
Its all fun and games until the kid sleeps over at the fawn house.

"You sleep where?!"
Watches a lot of Disney maybe?
My son brought home a window salesman. I would have preferred a fawn.
She found a deer friend.
Child magic
Aww, hi Bambi!
This the definition of "AWWWWWWWwwwwwaahhhhhhhhhhhhh omg omg omg my heart wtf"
There is an episode on Arthur where Gilly wants to bring home a deer.
Being There
*I swear he followed me home.*
It's like 6 or earlier I'm the morning mate ?
Most likely was fed by humans before
Well y'all know that's your family pet now right
Can we keep him?
Pretty sure that kid is either Disney prince or a beast-master. Both cool.
God Steve Carell was young in this movie
Awwwww
Cringey
THATS A BIG DOG
Where in Virginia? I live in Chesapeake.
Uh ... that’s cute but also scary! Mom or dad could’ve kicked the shit outta this kiddo!
Now she has a friend that will grow up with her
Ok my only question is. Does this kids want to join a DnD group?
WOW ! Nicest pic I have seen in a while ! Brave boy:)
Did you adopt it or eat it?
Everyone knows that deers hate cereal. They like pop tarts
Brilliant. This little man obviously has a good spirit to have such a timid beautiful creature that trusts him like that. He's a credit to his parents. Good kid.
This kid wins Reddit today!
Kid is now infested with fleas and deer ticks.
PARASITES. Like, ALL WILD LIFE HAS THEM. ALL OF WILD LIFE IS FULL OF THEM. Also its physically dangerous but who knows maybe that kid is a deer whisperer. BUT THAT JUST MEANS HIS MOUTH IS CLOSER TO THE PARASITE BEAST.
Aw man, as a kid that would be a dream come true lol - very cute
Mademesmile
And the child even has little deer printed on the pajamas.  ☺️
I wonder if you can get a deer sized flea and tick collar?
Will no one point out that this was done once with giving a Moose a muffin to disastrous consequences?
level 1 druid found his animal companion
Imma show you my crib
This kid is a disney princess
GOLD and SILVER, SILVER and GOLD
This is the birth of Disney Prince and princesses
Probably just a one star

Can I keep him?
He told his friend that his mom makes the best pancakes.
I sure hope you had some corn for a snack
My ovaries 😭
HOLY BUCK!
Why was he outside playing in pajamas?
“Okay remember, if you ask my mom if you can sleepover, she’ll say yes”
"Mummy, Bambi followed me. Can he stay with us?" Hahahaha that's so cute!
This is Virginia for you!!
both adorable
Oh deer.
Awww that’s cute
Yo I’m from Virginia to
Kids and animals....magical❤❤❤
So much precious in this picture.
Lol that's just adorable
I don't want to be the buzzkill because this is cute, it really is, but... If a wild animal is friendly when the species is usually aggressive or fearful, it probably has rabies. So, like... Yeah. Be careful about that sort of thing.
I’d watch this movie
I acctuly stayed in that same place before you, I won’t say where don’t worry but I recognize the landscape and the same thing happened where we would always run into some new friends.
As a kid I wanted a pet deer. Mom insisted it would never work out and would only run away. All these years later I find out she lied...lol...sHe WaS WrOnG😒😒😒
And Lyme disease
Can’t leave them for a second can you...
Cute until it's animal instincts kick in and those boney legs thrash the kid. I've seen that happen. Broken ribs on a kid is brutal.
Was the new friend Lyme disease? Cause this is how you get Lyme disease.
Mine’s the deer, we found the kid in a hole
ya'all got any more of that lime disease?
Kids, puppies, and now fawns, beautiful innocence.
Check him for ticks please
Your kid just abducted someone's kid.
That’s incredible!
“Can Carlos come play at my den?”  So cute. Just throwing it out there, I would give your son a quick look all over for deer ticks.
Bambi 😊
Several friends, if you count the ticks.
Um pretty sure your raising some sort of disney character...
Just please check him for ticks.
Aww
Gawwww. They look so adorable
Disneyesque
Ticks

Ticks

Ticks

Ticks
Ticks

Ahhhhh ticks
So nice, he came back with the day's lunch!
It's so adorable and loving.
Can’t get over this!
Oh deer. What will you do?
Did the mother let her kid go outside in the middle of the snowy winter to play in pyjama really? No gloves, no scarf, no credibility.
That new friend being "Lyme disease".
This picture just made my year !
I'm more amused at the amount of "deers"...

Deer is S&P.

Just like Anime, its S&P.
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
It seems like that was dangerous sending him back out to the forest line with fawn, as the mother might be aggressive though, right? I don't know much about deer behavior other than videos of mother deer attacking dogs/cats for being too close.
How the fuck does this even happen
She is chosen! Disney princess
I live in virginia!
They look like they’re about to ask if the other can sleep over
This is me at 30🤣🤣🤣I love all animals
So happy he came back in! I was afraid you were going to say"Went out the back door and never came back."
Amazing
How tf did it get the child home
Cute
I don t know who s cuter!
Aww how adorable 🥰
Tick check!
This is amazing, that 4 year old deer found this human child and brought it back home. The human child’s mother must be sick with worry.
Cute human and cute deer.
Wait few days and that 4yo old will make jungle book 2
What about the dawn’ table manners?
🤩😍
Awe so cute! This is a miracle because usually animals are just as scared of humans as we are of it but this cutie was like "nuh uh your my new friend!"
Why would someone let a 4yo outside unsupervised..
I can’t decide which one is cuter. Such a nice pic on another boring day hiding from Covid. Ty.
Lol. heres how to start another pandemic! So cute!
What a baller
Oh my god that so adorable
This is amazing!!
[Here’s](https://www.wavy.com/news/trending/a-deer-friend-4-year-old-boy-brings-home-an-unlikely-companion/) a news story about it.
I bet he will have creatures gravitate towards him his whole life he has the gift! Butterflies and hummingbirds will land on him, all animals will automatically trust him. I have an uncle the same way he’s the Prince Charming to Snow White lol
Username checks out.
Imagine 😭
fyi, deer aren't friendly to people around their young, they'll stomp the shit out of you and theyre fast. keeping a distance is always the best idea.
That doe has the best eye lashes
I see this and I get a bit afraid. What if momma deer sees her fawn with the human child and attacks? This could be dangerous right?
This looks like something from a children's book. Like, if you give a mouse a cookie.

If you give a deer some cereal.
Most adorable thing I've ever been blessed to see. Awwww!
Bro, your son is a Disney princess.
This is weird but this kid is like the spitting image of my kid...
i think your deer just kidnapped a child
Hi mommy. My new friend gave me Lyme Disease
Disney prince confirmed.
I think the kid must belong to someone, tho.
Made my day
don't post  child face
How magical! That kid is definitely a druid.
Quick qn is this guy's dad Magneto?
And the kid is wearing rudolph PJs. That's adorable.
Went out to play in his pyjamas?
What a beautiful little soul
This world still has some good in it.
Your child might be a Disney princess
so cute
yey I'm da ROBUX MAN do you want free ROBUX?????????
He has a promising career on Animal Planet ahead of him
So you're child is actually Artemis....
What’s even better is that the deer has that *I hope they like me* look people have when they’re being introduced to other people.
I really think children can communicate with animals, spirits, or even “ghosts”. But we take that ability away from them when we tell them not to do it, or it’s “just their imagination”. There was a story about a little girl sharing a bowl of berries with a black bear. She even smacked the bear on his hand when he got to grabby. The bear never hurt her!!
Aww ❤️that’s so cute!! I think this is going to be a hard memory to forget 😘what a precious picture and story to tell him when he’s older. Thank you for sharing ❤️made my morning a bit brighter :))
Aw where in Virginia?? Im in virginia beach and, where I live, I see deer sometimes.
Omg they are the same.

My mom sent me out in the wilderness and I made a friend!
We sometimes have an entire village of deer just vibing in our sub division, I’ve seen seven all together so far just in my backyard, and its not that big of a yard!
I did this. Spent a bunch of time in the woods as a kid, thinking I was Pocahontas or something. Found a baby deer when I was about 6-7 and I worried because it was all alone. So with my trusty (and VERY curious) dog, I carried this thing over a mile from the woods to my back porch. I knocked on the door, and when my mom opened it I asked if I could bring it inside. It was awfully hot out...😂 Needless to say, my city slicker mother panicked and called animal control who told her to have me take it back to where I found it.
“Can we keep him?”
I lived on an island that has miniature deer. As a prank, a bunch of us put cheerios all over someone's car at night so when she went to drive away the next morning, her care was surrounded by a mob of deer.  They are very tame, and she had to shoo them all away.
Yeah right. 4 year old goes outside to play in his PJs and coat unzipped in the middle of a winter.
To cute
That child must have a gentle soul. How precious. ❤️
I can see this kid talking with this fawn. Hey come over to my place, my parents got food.
