Be careful everyone, Lickaphen is known to be highly addictive. Side effects include extreme happiness and the urge to take the day off and go to the dog park. 
But it's also okay to need real medicine too.
Teaching your dog to lick holes, I see.
this is very nice but i would recommend other medicine too
r/wowthanksimcured 
These anti vaxxers are getting weirder and weirder 
Probably an unpopular opinion here, but I don‚Äôt like when dogs lick me. I‚Äôm all good with cuddling and petting, but licking is a hard no for me.
üòÇ Wasn‚Äôt expecting that. 
The only medicine I need ^(is antibiotics because I have an infection.)
Damn, I thought the answer was "more cowbell"
I‚Äôm gonna stick with my narcolepsy meds so I don‚Äôt fall asleep on the bathroom floor again thanks 
They tried to make me go to rehab

I said, yes, yes please
But... I still need my antipsychotics...
American medical system: That will be $10000 please and bone for payment
That's really flipping cute!
And antibiotics. I need those too. Doggy kisses don't cure lyme disease.

And peanut butter right?
This is gonna get memed with weird things coming through the hole and I can't say I'm sorry about it.
Doggy kisses are great, but they won't fix the chemical imbalances already in my brain 
Looks like a weird glory hole.
Haha...so cute
Take these on dogtor's orders.
I was anxiously awaiting the background doggo's introduction and it did not disappoint 
I‚Äôm sure OP knows that actual medicine works, too. Calm down.
I am very glad that the thoughtful people in the comments are making us all aware that this isn't real medicine. You guys really saved me, I almost ditched my insulin for a dog.

There is a 0% chance that this was not about a penis 
Cute but I might carry on taking my insulin just in case üòÇ
You have diabetes, Caroline. Your dog can't give you your insulin.
unfortunatly i also need insulin 
d'awwwwr,   
i wish i was neurotypical enough to only need a dog instead of mood altering drugs to not be a danger to myself...
Idk xanax is pretty cool too
The thought of a tongue papercut puts me on edge.
‚ÄúDoctor he has multiple gunshot wounds!‚Äù
‚ÄúAh fuck it, just get a dog or something‚Äù
That‚Äôs fucking gross 
Braggart. Some of us need more than a wet tongue punch from a furbratt to stay healthy.
Eh. As much as I like dog kisses I still need my antipsychotics thanks. 
This is not helping with my bi polar manic schizophrenia but I'm no quiter
50 milligrams please. It‚Äôs been a rough day.
This needs to be available for order.  My wife's birthday is coming up.  And yes . . .I will be doing what you think I'll be doing . . . with my penis

I think a lot of you are forgetting you're in /r/aww ...

*Obviously* no one is suggesting this is legitimate medical advice. It's meant to be cute... You're either all taking this *way* too seriously, or you're all *really* struggling to come up with an original joke.
Always upvote the flippist
Thank you for the giggle. 
I'm going to need a double dose, Doc. 
Ugh, self medicators these days are so stupid

/s
There's a lot of people in this thread who REALLY don't like doggy kisses.
Whats up with all the deleted comments
But also antidepressants
Adorable! Did you put peanut butter at the back of the Flipbook? I don't mean to ruin the magic.
Disgusting and degenerate.
I mean, I guess that works if you're not sick.
I also need that medicine.
A nice sentiment if everyone was born with perfect genetics and/or didn't develop random problems in their life.

It's easy to say stuff like this when you have no experience on the other side.

How disturbing
Aww sweet baby,  looks so much like my Coco.  I would love to know what this dog is. Coco's mom was a Chihuahua but I do not know about daddy. So, if you can help me determine what Coco's and this dogs relatives are, I would appreciate it very much.  (They both have the same face and floppy ears  and look to be small, like  10 lbs) Thank you
ITT: People taking this post way too seriously.
A friend of mine calls his dog Lex.

It's short for Lexapro, because the dog is his anti-depressant.
I also need them painkillers on account of my back
Watch out, the dog could get a papercut.
Ok that is damn cute. 
Every time I see stuff from him posted, no one actually credits him. Sure his name is on the cover, but did you know he's on reddit?

u/theflippist

His stuff gets re-uploaded pretty much the second he makes a new post, with zero credit going to him.

Fuck you OP


The best flip-book I've EVER seen! Total wasn't expecting that :D
[deleted]
I'm reading all the comments like Damn! I think everyone is reading too much into this. I think OP just thought it would be a cute video. The tongue coming out of the bottle was cute.  \*shrug\* I saw this as just a creative cute video by a person who really loves their puppy 
anti-vaxxers are getting adorable
The only medicine I need is a gun to end all my problems (: 
Sure hope your not trying to treat tuberculosis
Take my upvote, just take it 
Reminds me of the scene in the attic in the Goonies.

What happened here???
Not gonna lie, I was expecting a üñï

Pleasantly disappointed 
Can they cure my friends diabetes?
The sad thing is that not even "doggy kisses" are safe any more. I saw on the news last week that some guy had to get all of his arms and legs amputated because there's a rare bacteria within dogs that can eat away at some people's tissue. He become a paraplegic because of his dog. Yikes!
Did the dog get a paper cut? Why is no one else concerned about this?

Good boy was right on cue.
Dog kisses are nice but have ya ever just posted something from Instagram on Reddit without any real attribution for easy karma?
Couldn‚Äôt help hoping the dog didn‚Äôt get a tongue paper cut.

Come on guys it's just a cute little expression of how dog kisses are nice. Why are all these comments acting like it's a serious attack against real meds? I take antidepressants and I thought it was fun.
I really dislike this because it kind of gives off the tone that people who actually need medication are somehow "less than". 
Thank you for this ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ I'm finally going to stop taking my bipolar meds now
Tell that to herpes.
/r/wowthanksimcured
Whew. I definitely thought this was going the way of "nobody needs drugs!" and was not ok with that trajectory. 

Holy this is such a cute good boy üòç
This is almost NSFW
It would be so awesome if they just had like a place you could go hang out with dogs the way they have cat caf√©s and you could just wait feed the dogs or play with them and just get like a dose of some love and it could be either pay through insurance or maybe like a five dollar donation or something like that!

Somebody with dogs and a sense of business planning and organization get on this immediately and make some money!!
(And boost our happy chemicals lol) 

It would also help save dogs from the shelters. They kill them like weekly or something IDK.

I was upset yesterday about something and both of my dogs licked my face until I smiled then they laid across my chest. Dog kisses are the best medicine because they know exactly where you hurt.

Giggity.
I love my dog. Shes laying next to me rn. But currently have 2 broke ribs, broken collarbone, and my pelvis is broken in 2 spots, and a big bruise all over. I cant move without some painkillers. But the kisses help too.
This was refreshingly original 
I bet that guy from Wisconsin who contracted an infection from a dog lick leading him to have his legs and hands amputated wishes this was the case.
This is so freaking cute!! 
That was funny before it started moving 
I was expecting a cowbell at the end. Don't know why though.

This is a wholesome version of those people who say "*all depressed people need is to go outside and be happy*"
Honestly this makes me angry. I'm like Lenny when it comes to cute things. I just squeeze too tight. Sorry not sorry. 
I have the exact dog as you!!! Except it had a underbite! What kind of dog?
This is really nice but I'm shit scared of doggos. I'm glad they can help some people though :)

It's also okay to get medical help, asking for help makes you stronger and I recommend you try if it gets bad.
The only medicine you need is 5million dogbacteria. Got it.

Jk, I love dogs.

Not really kidding though, there‚Äôs a loooot of shit on that tounge.

This is very cute! but as others have pointed out, let‚Äôs please remember that people sometimes need more to get through their lives than a dog or support animal. Stay healthy, people! 
Yes, doggie kisses are great, but this seriously comes across as some anti-science bullshit.  Medicines save lives‚Äîthere is NO substitute.

I was so scared that it was going to be an essential oil
I thought it was gonna be like "the only medicine I need iS nAtURe!!" or something like that. Was not prepared.
I would have accepted removing the book and showing the dog. I also very much agree

Edit:It ended too soon, I wanted to stare at those big eyes a little 
longer. 

Edit#2: I just want to be clear to those who are distracting others with their whiny, crybaby over sensitive shit...Just stop it. 
The title is ‚ÄúThe only medicine I need‚Äù referring to OP, not the entire over-medicated world. 

Unfortunately, I am personally very involved in polypharmacy, but would LOVE for this to be the only medicine I need and at times, it is.
I love dogs, but I don't think doggy kisses will help with my diabetes.
My depression is cured. üòç
That's good that its the only med you need. With the damn goverment deciding that people with chronic pain (yes i am one, among the many ailments i have, i just had brain surgery 2 weeks ago) do not need pain control, that's about all you can get. 
So we shouldn't seek help if we are depressed? Just have a dog lick us? I know this is supposed to be "cute" but 8t feels like one of those "man up and drink your problems away!" bullshit sentiments. 
I think you all need some of this medicine, considering how serious everyone is taking this. Lighten up.
What the hell is going on in this comment section? It's like a bombardment from pharmacy companies.

&#x200B;

"No no, you still need meds guys!!!1"
Very adorable, but no. 
No. No no no. Fuck this. Fuck everyone who thinks like this. If you need medicine, take it! And nobody - ill or well - should NEVER discourage others from taking their medicine. Nobody should be shamed for it, or get told that the only medicine they need is an animal, nature, essential oils, or any of that nonsense.

Fuck this post honestly.
I'll tell you what, last time I had pneumonia when no matter how many snuggled and kisses my dog gave me only think that helped was antibiotics. 
Should be prescribed by every doctor
Please brain, stop ruining this adorable scene

I am a 71 year old female, I was diagnosed of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 2015 , my symptoms started out with muscle weakness, difficulty speaking, fatigue , double vision, difficulty swallowing and anxiety. I was unable to go back to work, I tried Riluzole (Rilutek) for about a year. Tried every shot available, but nothing worked.My ALS Disease got significantly worse and unbearable because of my cognitive thinking. In 2017, I started on ALS Herbal formula from Natural Herbal Gardens, the treatment worked incredibly for my ALS condition. I used the Natural ALS Herbal formula for a total time period of 3 months, it totally reversed my ALS. I had a total decline of all symptoms including muscle spasms, difficulty swallowing, drooling and others. Sometimes, i totally forget i ever had ALS. Visit Natural Herbal Gardens web-site ww w. naturalherbalgardens. com. I am very pleased with this treatment. I eat well, sleep well and exercise regularly. My attitude is extremely positive.
