I love Molly! Happy Birthday!  Tim, well I guess it's your birthday too.
Reminds me of The Springfield Files on the Simpsons where Homer and Santa's Little Helper have the same birthday.

Homer: Oh, it's Bart. I can't believe it. I'm being mocked by my own children. On my birthday.

Bart: It's your birthday?

Homer: Yes. Remember? It's the same day as dog's.

Lisa: Santa's Little Helper, it's your birthday? Ooh, we've got to get you a present. Yes, we do. Yes, we do!
Poor Tim. Always second. Happy birthday Molly.












And tim
This is the most cat-dad-Tim looking motherfucker I’ve ever seen.
Molly looks unhappy with Tim getting some space on her cake
Tim is not amused by the cake - or is he?
They look equally thrilled.
Tim is an odd name for a cat.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLY! (you, too, Tim)
they both look so disappointed 😂

it's the great part about it ghough
###***Here's to Molly!!***

^^and_tim
I can see the joy in his eyes...
I love the giant cat tower in the back ground... Tim knows his place 🤣
Fortunately my cats birthday is a whole 3 weeks ahead of mine, so my girlfriend can devote months to finding him a gift, then still has a few weeks to toss something together for me.
Happy birthday to Molly! Happy Tim to Molly as well, whatever that means. That part of the cake confuses me. Who's that guy in the picture? He's taking up too much of the frame on Molly's big day. How selfish!

Sarcasm, of course. I read the title. Molly's a cutie.
Happy BD Molly! umm Tim too.
Oh yeah, you too Tim.
Happy birthday Molly!!! Oh and what's his face Tim. 😁
This is the cutest thing ever!! Happy birthday:)
[deleted]
Omg tell your cat I said happy birthday!!
I share the same birthday with my sisters cat
Rip tim
Giving my Hugz award to Tim! Happy Birthday dude!
Happy Birthday to Molly!  Tim, too!  This is the best thing I’ve seen in a while. Totally made my day!!
So that's your husband and cat accounted for. Who's the guy holding him?
This is peak reddit
Happy Birthday Molly, suck a fat one Tim.










Jk Tim Happy Birthday.
Stoic.
Awww Happy Birthday Molly!!! ^and ^Tim
Me and my partners future lol
They look thrilled. 🤣

Happy Birthdays, Molly! (and tim)..
The only thing that could have made this cake better is if "and Tim" was written in comically small text.
Um... are we going to talk about how they look alike?
Tim has an awesome sense of humor. And also understands the cat is in charge.
What’s a birthday week?
Is it just me, or does Tim look absolutely dead inside...
Tim looks so displeased that Molly is first on the cake
Both are best birthday buddies 😄
Peak reddit
Yes. Priorities!
This is why I wish - sometimes - that we didn't have a cat.
[removed]
Neither look amused
Notice OP says it’s *her* cat and not *their* cat — explains everything!! Happy Birthday, Molly! (and Tim)
Happy Birthday, Molly!
Did they practice having the same face?
Happy birthday Molly!!
Happy birthday Molly!



Oh wait, I almost forgot.




That's a cool cake!




(Happy birthday Tim)
Omigosh! Happy Birthday, Molly. 🥳

Edit: oh and you too Tom...Tim. 😅
There are some who call me... Tim?
you got your priorities straight  on that cake and his face tells.
I love the fucked up blinds in the background. All Tim related for sure
You shouldn't spoil your pet so much... a mention of his name in Molly's cake? He's going to start believing they're both equally important
You can see it in his face who's the favorite one in the relationship.
I see who’s the most important in this family...
That face screams ‘just take the photo already so you can have your online moment.’
The husband looks thrilled
Do you guys purposefully leave your blinds crooked like that so the cat can make it from the tower to the rail via the mantle?
My bedroom isn't my bedroom. It's my cat's bedroom and it happens that I sleep there too
Looks like he's totally into it.
My husband’s birthday is the day after the cat’s. We might need to celebrate similarly.
My dog and I share a birthday so I know what it’s like lol. Happy birthday!
Hard to tell who looks less enthused there
They look alike
Oh wow, they kind of look alike. Are they related? It’s a compliment, she’s a very pretty kitty.
>!CENSORED!<
And facial expressions
Kitty gets top billing🤣
crosspost to r/fondanthate for extra karma
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLY!!!
Really sucks Molly has to share birthdays with... tim.
It’s my birthday today as well! Happy birthday birthday buddy! (and Tim)
He looks like a super villain

I probably watch too much Austin Powers
Best cake ever. Ever.
Love it! (And Tim.)
What a handsome pair.
The guy is smiling like that because Tim is the cat’s name..
If my wife put me second I’d be thrilled
[removed]
I love how unimpressed he looks.
Which is the husband
Tim does not look thrilled
Plot twist: The husband’s name is Molly
Tim looks so...what's the word? I know it isn't "happy," but something else.
Tim deserves a cupcake at least no?
He nailed the exact level of disgust to show.
I can see the sadness in Tim’s eyes lol
Not sure which one is going to stab you first.
I loved the "(and Tim)"
Your husband is on the right? 🐱
He looks like he's taking it well. 😉
What until Tim bites into the tuna and kibble cake...Happy Birthday Molly and Tim.
Tim is either a talented actor or is seriously contemplating divorce in that photo.
The cat looks way happier and more proud of himself than the husband
They look so happy together…
And doesn't he just look delighted.
wow that window sill is prime cat chilling real estate.

My cats would be jealous.
I love Molly.
That’s right know your place peasant!!!
Happy birthday Molly!! 😁🎉


And yeah, Tom or whatever... 😒
Looks like Molly is more valuable family member than Tim. Plus, she has to share her birthday cake. Life is not fair. Happy birthday Molly and Tim! To many more happy years together!
Happy B-Day...

And I guess you too Tim...
Why are they making the same face?
I hope Molly let's Tim have some of her birthday cake
You can tell which of these pets is her favorite
Fuck it, I get cake. 

Tim, probably.
Happy birthday Molly 🎉🎁🎊🎈
🤣 Tim only gets a parenthetical honorable mention
If you photoshop out any evidence of the husband, then the image and caption becomes much funnier
The 50% divorce rate in the USA takes into account marriages that took place a long time ago that, by thenselves, have a much lower rate.

That means older, still married, people are skewing the data and the divorce likelihood for younger people is even higher.

Covid doesn't help either.
he appreciated all the love he got. it displayed on his face.
We just keep tim around cause he feeds us
The cat ironically enough, reminds me of Angela from The Office - don't ask me how!
I love Molly! Happy birthday! Hi Tim.
You have your priorities straight and I respect the hell out of that.
r/watchpeopledieinside
Look at that living room; this is Molly’s house
It’s safest this way.
Neither of them look happy. Sorry Molly, sorry Tim.
That's a very nice cat tree in the corner!
Happy birthday molly!! (Tim too)
That blank look ahahahaha
Does a “birthday week” work like Groundhog Day but only 7 times and it’s your birthday?
I love seeing people who have their priorities straight. It just gives hope.
I read that in the voice from that one family guy episode where they are superheroes in the opening. ".... AND MEG"
It's good when partners communicate their priorities.
For realsies though, Happy Birthday, Tim, and may you have many more more, with kitty snuggles and happy memories made along the way.

Molly you're perfect keep doing what you're doing
So happy for Molly! And tim, I guess.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLY

&#x200B;

nobody gives two shits about tim. but we do give one so be greatful!
Tim is a very nice name for cat
Tim should get a chair for his birthday
Is that Tim or Molly’s tower in the background
I also share a birthday with one of our cats. We did not get a cake last week.
You look like the real Garfield (and Jon Arbuckle)
The look of confusion on his face
My cat is named molly too😁
I don't know why, but my small cat is not interested in clicking picks. Give me tips. She is soo naughty.
[removed]
WTF is a birthday week?  Why not a birthday month? Or how about everyone just shares a birthday year?

This whole schnoodle thing is so freaking cheesy and corny

My cat was born sometime between January 2017 and December 2017. Idk how people can say "my cats birthday" unless they were there. I'm not saying op wasn't there. I just know people that are like "my cats birthday is xx/xx" even though they adopted.
Poor husband. I don’t even know when my cat’s birthdays are. They are pets and my husband is well my husband.
My childhood cat was named Molly and we were best friends. Love to your Molly!
I love how Tim’s birthday took the backseat 🤣
Sigh...

Aww it's my birthday week too! Happy Birthday Molly!

Edit: and Tim 🤭
[deleted]
[deleted]
🤣🤣
Birth day weeks and months are not a thing
Aww.this is cute.
My husband would do something like this for me. Cuz he knows how much they mean to me.
On the bright side they have kids and are not only fur parents
Tim is not amused.
But only the cat gets cake
This got over 70k upvotes. I think if you switched husband and cat in the title it may have broken 100k.
F**king remove the bell, please.
Edit: Also, hilarious! Happy birthday!
Truth be told, Molly is my favorite too.
😬
Your husband looks very sad. Maybe have a look after him.
Lol. That’s awesome! HAPPY BIRTHDAY beautiful MOLLY! and tim
Hahaha! Queen Molly rules the roost!
What a PRETTY 🤩 cat!
happy birthday molly!!!!!!









...oh right, and tim
I love that cake! I prioritize cat birthdays too.
(and Tim)
That is an awfully handsome cat though.
Who gives a shit?
[removed]
those are the cold, dead eyes of a serial killer.
[removed]
This is so funny!! Hopefully Tim thinks so too!!
Stupid loveable cat.
Molly isn’t too happy about sharing a birthday.
I thought it said Moby at first. That would be a good cat name.
Your Molly and my Apollo could be long lost siblings!
This is amazing! My fiance's birthday is the day before our cat's birthday. Definitely doing this next year (if I remember....)!
Hahaha the huge cat tree in the back
At least you have your priorities in order.
It seems like a joke at first...then you see the cat tower in the background.
My cats birthday is a day before mine!
Why does your cat require glasses. And why does you husband have a COLLAR?
Man looks like he's gonna khs😂 bet it's not his
Is the cake liver flavored?
Tim stealing thunder, damnit Tim
Aww, they both have the same expression. Happy birthday, Molly. (And Tim)
My sweet Arya was born on or around my birthday (July 13th). She's a rescue so we're not sure the exact date. We chose to celebrate her birthday on my birthday anyway. She'll be 2 this year and now I know what I want on my cake
A very Happy Birthday to Tim and Molly. Hope the both had an amazing day 🎂🎁🎈
Title kinda makes it sound like the husband is also the cat.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLY...yeah you too Tim.
aw I wish I had a cat to share a birthday with XD
My spouse and cat (formerly 2 of our cats) share a birthday.  At least one year, the cat was the birthday queen.
Plot twist: Tim eats all the cakes, molly gets nothing! 😂 

Happy birthday to you two!
That is a noble beast. And the cat's good lookin' too!
lol
OMG HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLY AND WISH YOU THE BEST, THAT CAKE OF YOURS LOOKS AMAZING 
And tim, congrats on getting older i guess
I love this so much.
(and Tim)…perfect afterthought.
So they share a birthweek, weak. My cousin and his hamster share the same birthhour.
My Ali shares a bday with his Dad. I'm stealing this idea full stop. 😂
Great cake.
My wife and our two dachshunds have three different birthdays in the same week in April. I’m a very busy party planner that week.
Tim is a strange name for a cat.
It's great(not so great) that Tim is in parentheses after the cat's big part of the cake so, I think we all know who the favorite in the family is.
Scary resemblance to dablegs ok tiktok😳
Tim’s the husband isn’t he
They both look just as annoyed with that fact.
Tim looks unamused lol
You can just tell that cat is thinking "Oh this is gonna make things awkward..."
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you both!
“You said the cake was for both of us but only the car is referenced.”
My cat's birthday is the day before mine, I'm pretty sure this will happen to me at some point but I don't know when
Wow....a female ginger. Happy birthday Molly!......  and Tim.
Awww! 😍Happy birthday, Molly!
Happy Birthday Molly.

^and ^Tim.
This is a dream of mine u/hawaiislim808
That must have been a fun order to place
Happy birthday Molly!!!

Oh, and you too Tim.
Omg, the toys in the background, the cat tower, this picture is just so wholesome
Perfectly
Balanced
As
All
Things
Should
Be
Upvoting for Molly (suck it, Tim!)
Paul giamatti
Love the brackets!!
Anyone seen the cat?
Tim looks pleased lol. Happy bday to them both
Lol my kitty cat's name is Molly!!
I'm absolutely dead 😂😂 Happy Birthday to them both!
[Cats can’t taste sweet. ](https://youtu.be/zfBJmytIegs)
I’ve never understood celebrating a pet’s birthday
Cute
happy birthday to both!! totally doing this for my sister and cat haha, their birthdays are august 22 and 23
Happy Birthday Molly…oh yeah u too tim
if you dont do birthday months, then you are doing it wrong
I audibly laughed at this. That is too freaking cute!
Tim face!  Rethinking all of life.  Haha.
Happy birthday to you ❤️♥️🌺🌸
Love how Tim was an afterthought.
That's so cute!
Happy Birthday Molly and Tim !
Hope there's *tuna* in that cake.
My older brother's birthday was the day before mine when we were kids and we'd have to share birthdays.  After he got done breaking all of his presents he'd start breaking mine.
Molly, what a beautiful picture of you! Happy birthday!! I would like to wish you a day filled with love and happiness and with many more to come. 

Edit: oh and hbd tim.
Can I have a little whinge, please?  My wife and my oldest child share the same birthday, and the cat’s birthday is the next day. It’s madness!
Wait, you guys have blinds that aren't messed up?
Priorities.
Hes got her pretty good and squished... I'd give it aaaaaa..... 8/10.
Happy Birthday, Molly (and Tim)!
Long life and prosperity
Molly is a good name for a husband
Molly is first, Tim is second.
Happy Birthday Tim!!! (and molly)
Poor kitty is doing her best to look like daddy.
Adorable. Happy birthday 🎁
He looks like a tim
Can Molly eat this cake? Asking the important question here.
Molly seems like a character to me.....
they look the same too
k
This is hilarious, his face makes the picture so good.
Happy Birthday Molly!!! <3 <3 ..oh and Tim.
#beta
“Happy birthday Molly! (and Tim). Say cheese!”
Hey I share the same birthday as Molly! This Tim guy seems to be crashing our party tho
I can relate to this so much because me and my dad share a birthday, exactly 30 years apart so when I turned 10 my dad was 40, so my parents went out and celebrated my dad whilst I was stuck home watching a movie with my sisters old friends who I didn’t even know existed until earlier that day... sorry I ranted lol
Cutie.
Happy Birthday Molly 🥳 (Feat. Tim)
He definitely looks like a Molly
r/tim
Cute cat
Molly shared her cake with her Daddy! How sweet 🥰
Same cat tree, nice. Oh and Happy Birthday!
Molly has matching face as Tim. This too cute
Wow is this is good
That’s great! My wife and dog share a birthday, January 6th, crazy.
Similar to the expression I'd have if my wife presented me with the same cake decor.
That's funny, my wife and cat share a birthday.
Priorities are in the correct order I see.
Please make the font for Tim smaller.

- The Cat
(and Tim)
This is the most r/watchpeopledieinside thing I've ever seen.
Me and my cat were born in the same month too. I don't know exactly when she was born so I'll just say we have the same birthday
tim is not pleased
That cat tower in the back speaks enough!
My dad and our cat growing up had the same birthday. We would host his birthday and then turn off the lights in the kitchen for a brief moment and then host a birthday for our cat with a fried egg instead of a cake. Like we would sing Happy Birthday again and applaud.
Next time spell his name wrong. Oh, and make it out of cat food.
There’s divorce in his eyes
The massive cat tower in the background confirms who really runs the place.
That’s quite the cat tree! I get the feeling that expression is year round for Tim.
Are they... *printing* cakes now?
I love she gets top billing.
Molly is cute. Why does Tim need to be in the picture?
When your spouse likes your cat more than you 😞
Cute!
Where is Tim's picture on the cake 🐈
He does not look so happy, poor tim..
Tim is the cat’s second name
They look ecstatic.
Okay, but both adorable.
Which one is Molly?
Cat is clearly the favorite.
And Tim too.
Happy Birthday Tim!
Considering the cake has a photo of the cat. 
Cat owns the cake.
WHat tha fuck is going on here!
No
Bhahahahhah!  So do my daughter and chickens.
Qué lindo gatito. Felicidades a los dos.
I like the sideways blinds and all too familiar toys in view.
This reminds me of a funny story so when my dad was a kid my dad & my grandparents had a cat named Molly when “she” was about a year old they found out that molly was actually a boy but she/he was used to that name so they just kept it
Hahaha. We’re getting a puppy that was born on my husband’s birthday (April 27), and this is definitely what he has to look forward to.
Happy birthday Molly! I hope it was amazing snd all your wishes come true. And you too, Tim. 😹
Perfect
They look alike
You’re so lucky to get a Schnoodle to go with a great photo.
He looks ***pleased***
I don't make birthday for me
Happy birthday to both!
Happy birthday Molly you majestic beast! and you too Tim
Not always.
Lol, and Tim
Cute that you named your cat Tim
Tim looks like he’s at the breaking point.  I’d be worried leaving him alone with the cat.
lol that’s awesome
I also share a bday with my kid. So I don’t have a bday. Cake day is my only day.
Great
*”Lousy, lovable cat!”* – Tim (probably)
Tim is *not* amused!
My dog and sister shared a birthday week and one year my grandma made a cake that said “Happy Birthday Pepper (and Holly)”. This photo just reminded me of that memory! Wish I had a photo of it.
Hahaha!  If he doesn't stay bitter about it, you know you married the right guy.
So do my husband and dog!!!
I bought a German Shepard with papers an to my suprise her birthday was my dads birthday. I moved into a house i couldn't have pitbulls or german Shepard's it was in tge lease. I left her with my parent's she loved it over there and when i moved i would get her back. Well my ma has since died 3 weeks after ma died her dog julie died and that broke my pops heart all over again. So now due to emtional circumstances she is his n dog now i couldnt take her from him she is his best friend an she keeps him active. Which is great she is a young dog too,  well 4 years old anyway, i call her young cause she can still jump over the fence from standing, no running start ive never seen her running and jump the fence she always stops then leaps over it and takes of. When we got her i liked the name my youngest suggested and her name is Lala. Ma never liked it and always called her lulu lol. I miss my ma.
oddly enough i share a birthday with my cat. didn’t find out until taking him to the vet after adoption
(And Tim).   Haha. Love it.
(and Tim).

😂😂😂
They both seem thrilled
They look
related in a good way:)
(And Tim) lol
My dog and I share a birthday, and I totally know how this goes.
Today is also my cat’s birthday!! They turned one! How cool! Happy birthday!
My girl is also named Molly!
Soyddit
He looks like Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Paul Giamatti at the same time
priorities! check 

happy birthday kitty and Tim! you too
my guy looks salty but getting to mostly celebrate my cats birthday while i get some presents on the side would be a great time
This is the kind of thing that I live for.
*CGP Grey has entered the chat, TIM*
I share a birthday with my wife's cat, he always comes first ❤️
I can see who gets all the love in that pair. I'll bet Molly's cat fort back there is bigger than Tim's man cave.
OMG, this is a great idea! My husband and our dog actually have the exact same bday. It's in a few days so I still have time to get a similar cake.
This guy looks like a cat magnet
Hahaha awwwww well Happy Birthday Tim and Molly.
I love this so much
They look alike
My husband and cats also share a birthday week. What are the odds!
I, too, am the lowest ranking member of my home.
Tim, chill. Stop being such an attention hog
I like how the blinds are all fucked in the background. Was it the cat or the kid that did that?
Happy birthday Tim! (and molly)
how old of this cat?
This is accurate.
This is gold. Prioritizing the cat then mentioning your partner as a side piece is hilarious.

Upvoted all day.

I can honestly say i love pets more than humans.
I hope Tim likes the tuna cake.
Debra, please add Tim to the cake before he pops me like a balloon...

-Molly
Who got to choose the flavor of the cake?
He is not amused.
I would actually feel bad if this was a regular thing
Your husband looks like he argues with people just for fun.
My cat and I share a birthday week, too!
They look equally stoked about it.
My cats share a birthday week with their dad, too!
This is the proper order
Beta
That giant cat tower in the back says it all.
aw
Molly looks so happy and cute :))
That’s so lovely 🥰
My cat and I share the same birthday. So it's just "Happy Birthday Cat"
Thank you for making me laugh out loud on the shitty day I'm having.
Lol tim got the short end of the stick.
Love the (and TIM)
Happy Birthday Molly! ^^^And ^^^Tim
Disrespectful to her husband
How cute!!!! My cat Home Run and I actually share the same birthday!!
I love how there’s a huge photo of the cat and in small is his name...almost like it was an after thought lol. Cute though!
I like cats but...
The whole cake for molly and Tim.
Looks kinda dead inside. Love it.
The cake 😂😂😂
He looks thrilled, the cat not your husband.
ThAt cake cracks me up!!
Priorities done right, lol.
My dog was born on my wife's birthday. I'm sure she feels this so much.
Rest in peices tim
They have the same expression, I love it!
love it!
oh, gawd. they're starting to look alike.
My cat and I have the same birthday too! Didn't know until we filled out the adoption paperwork
They look the same age.
what iz de cat lookin at  🧐
Happy Birthday! My eldest and her dog share the same day, just 10 years apart.
This should be the picture on next year’s cake.
happy cat
Both so handsome 😻
that's why I'll never marry a feminazi
That collar looks a little tight. Make sure you can fit two fingers between the front if their neck and the collar.
Nice.
Millennials really were a mistake. Jesus fucking christ
(And Tim)
Thankfully Tim has a cat sized jungle gym to keep his mind busy while the (real) family eats the cake.
Imagine if it was handwritten on the cake
He looks thrilled!!!
Molly is very lucky! And such a pretty kitty. I hope she got a little taste of that cake!


Oh and Tim, too.
Go sleep on the couch, Tim! On second thought, try the floor cause the cat took your couch too
Happy birthday Molly and tim 😻
I just love this!
My wife and her cat share a birthday day. Always fun to get them matching presents.
Priorities are correct
Glad the cake said Tim because I barely noticed him!
Happy birthday to Molly and that other dude.
Happy Birthday Molly!

Oh and you too mister Tim!
I legit laughed out loud at this
Poor Tim!
He's not so happy.
They look alike 😲
(And Tim)
Molly clearly matters more /s
I love this!!
This marriage will last.
Your cat has a lot of toys
Everyone should own cats. And every cat should own a human.

Happy birthday to Molly! And also to Tim.
Cute
Awww I had a cat named Molly. She was such a good girl.
This is still funny!!
I'm like Tim, always second (damn - if I'm thinking about it, it's the third) choice...
(cat...child...............................me)
Who looks as sad as the other. The guy. Saying how did my life come to this. The cat how did my life come to this. 🤣
Love Molly 🧡                                                           and Tim
Omg that is one fine looking individual! Happy birthday, friend! I hope you get everything you wish for, darling! 🥳    
    
     
    
    
    
...oh yah and I guess the same to you, Tim
I’m upset Molly had to share her cake. Has anyone asked Tim if he minds celebrating a week earlier or a week later?
Your husband looks like a cross between John Green and Edward Snowden
God that’s good
The cat doesn't even know its their birthday you're wasting your time and frankly the cat's time as well.
getting dwight schrute “IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY” vibes from this image
Plot twist: Tim is the cat.
Tim, if you're out there, I've got $300 cash stowed away, a fast car, and some new clothes/disguises. I can get you out of there, man!
Your husband's facial expression speaks louder than words ever could....
Keep Ashly Burch **away**  from him
I love how it’s Molly’s cake and Tim’s sort of like an afterthought haha... happy birthday cat and man!
sorry tim but im taking over
Your husband and cat share a birthweek *
We know who’s the favorite here...
How do you get the cat to look at the camera?
I love this so much😭
Glad I’m not the only one who throws their cat a bday party. 

My cats bday is cinco de Mayo. So it’s deff a fiesta
I don’t mind my name below yours. I don’t even mind it smaller... BUT PARENTHESES????
I love this! ❤️Happy Birthday to both Tim and Molly!🎂
That's one of the smuggest cats on one of the smuggest cakes I've ever seen.

Still wanna moosh her face, though.
Aw
Yes¡!!!!!!! My husband and puppy share a birthday week and I'm SO excited to do this.
Tim deserves better,poor guy
Happy birthday molly!
Congratulations, a complete home: good husbands, good family, and good pet (Molly) ....
Happy birthday Molly!  
And who’s that dude holding you? Good day to you, sir.
They don’t look very happy about sharing the cake with someone else. Also Tim doesn’t look happy either
The real question I have is if kitty uses the cat tree.
Tbf Molly is very cute
You gotta tell Tim to cut losses with that hair once and for all. Just shave it off bro and be happy
That is sad!!!
He looks absolutely fancy 

And the cat looks good I guess.
Your cat looks like a hostage lol so cute
Which one is which?
Tim looks like he knows his place ahaha
Why do they look like each other
Aww happy birthday Molly!

^^and ^^Tim
This is the kind of marriage I strive for
That dude is all “This is my life.” Acceptance without enthusiasm. Poor guy.
My cat and I have the same birthday. I should totally do something like this.
Happy birthday to Both Of Them :(
Did Tim enjoy some of Molly's birthday cake?
I would be so offended.. imagine being put on the same level as a bloody husband
🤣🤣🤣
Tim doesn't look amused.
Even the cats like, "Karen I don't think Tim deserves this, and honestly, I feel uncomfortable."
Who gets the first slice?
Happy birthday molly
#latestagemarriage
It's face in the cake for Molly then.
so what is the man name
well planned, you'll never forget your husbands birthday now :D =\^,,\^=
Cat:  If it is mine special day, why are the Humans cutting an image of me?  Remind me to obey them?  


Human : when is mine birthday remembered?  Not as a subtitle.
They look pissed you didn’t get um’ any soy milk.
Yo sick glasses, where did he get them?
Molly’s sitting there thinking “Why is Tim tense?”
There the same thing .
You're not holding the cat right "click"
This looks exactly like my cat.
Poor bastard, looks at all the cat stuff
Bjerg has a cat?
Lol😂
Which one’s the husband?
I'd def rather have a bday party for my pet than myself
(and Tim) LOL he either is not surprised at this point or in love with your sense of humor.
This can be the photo for next years cake.
This guy looks like the typical redditor, and getting cucked out of his own cake. lol
I pondered way too long why the husband looked so defeated...re-read the title a few times, etc.

Finally scrolled all the way down and saw the cake.
"...and Tim" 
I got a good laugh out of that.
This, but with the dog, is basically what led to my divorce.
I really hope molly is the guys name...
I really hope molly is the guys name...because that cat looks like a Tim
I really hope moly is the guys name...because that cat looks like a Tim.
And does molly get to tear up the law patrol toys in the background?!? I see Marshall back there trying to look like it his birthday. No it’s not, it’s Molly’s! Get him molly!

Happy birthday!
My husband and cat do too! I may just have to steal this idea in October..
Awwww beautiful 😻
 Happy birthday  😍  😍
I share the same bday as my lil dog, and it's the day I asked my wife to be my gf.
Happy birthday Tim! But mostly happy birthday Molly!
I picture Tim having a cat. Also the type of guy that likes to hang out at coffee shops with his laptop and a Saturday night at a dive bar drinking artisan beer talking about cats. That's Tim.
I just realized my cat and I likely share a birthday week. She was born in May. Happy birthday Molly, and Tim.
She looks happier than you do XD
Sorry sir, this year the cat picked the cake.  Tuna, and salmon cake.
Omg! Hilarious!!!
Poor Tim!
They both look thrilled 😑
Mine, my boyfriend, and my cats birthday all fall within 6 days of each other. So we just celebrate the whole week
Molly looks ecstatic. Tim does not.
I can see why, Molly’s stuff takes up half the wall.
Why do I feel like I've seen this photo before someone help me
:D
Libs
This guy is dead inside thanks to that cake.
Had to be a fucking Tim.
That cat tree looks epic!
Real life Garfield and Jon
The excitement is infectious....
Have a very Happy Birthday Molly & Tim!  🤗
When life gets you down, just be thankful your not "and Tim". Lol
They both have very pretty eyes!
Happy Birthday to Molly and Tim!! 💕💕
Happy Birthday to Molly. Thanks Tim for holding her.
Happy birthday molly and the other guy
Furmother is definitely the most amused in this picture.
Happy birthday to the both of you!
I share a birthday week with your husband and cat too!!
when did this whole birthday week start?
Nice! It's my birthday too! 👍
My husband, both my children, my dog, my cat and myself were all born in August.
Omg Molly you are the most precious thing! 

Tim, hope you’ve been well.
That’s a Tim if I’ve ever seen one
They both seem like pretty serious cats.
Why is Tim's face not on the cake?
All things balanced, just as they should be.
My husband and my dog share a birthday. We all just say "The dogs birthday is coming up" or "What are we going to get the dog for her birthday". He says it doesn't bother him.
But we know... 😂
Ayy, my cat and I as well!! It’s this week as well! Mines tomorrow and hers was yesterday. Weird coincidence seeing this post not gonna lie
That Marshall toy in the background.  "I'm all fired up!"
Your husband is adorable. 

The pet is a little strange though; those glasses must have cost a ton.
Is your husband Jason Sudeikis?
Who’s older? HB Molly!!!  (& tim)
Aww. You just reminded me of a cat I had years ago that was born on my friend's birthday. 

And because I know someone will want to know; my friend did not get kitten. There were 4, we kept one, gave one away and two ran off before we could do anything. Friend's dad hated cats and they had a dog. ☮️
Neither one looks like they want to be in this photo and that just makes it more funny.
Erase that blue blasphemy from the cake post-haste! Long live Queen Molly!
Happy Birthday Tim
love it!
I feel bad for Tim
You can know who's the favorite one
Dead inside.
Awful thing is his name is Jeff.
Tim manages to make the cat look less pompous.
Perfection.
He looks thrilled.
“Thanks. I hate it.”
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOLLYYY!!!
Nice thought.
Me and my cat Millie also share a birth week! I adopted her 3 months before my birthday and she was exactly three months when we got her! So I just celebrate her birthday the day before mine!
The husband is an afterthought! Hahah
Nice cake.
Looks like Moly has gained some weight since the photo, but I'm not here to Molly fat-cat shame. COVID has been tough on us all. Happy birthday Molly (and Tim).
Your husband and cat looks very happy ! Who is the guy holding him ?
Saving on cake. Miser!
Me and my "sister"(parents one cat), share a birthday week also.
lol i like how the cat is on the cake. all hail queen molly.
So cat has a full birthday cake with his picture on it on his birthday but husband only has his name written on it .haha
Is your name Catherine?
Molly is my cat that ran away and now I'm sad :(
Happy Birthday Molly! 



























And you too Tim!
I think we can guess who gets the better presents!
I was wondering why he was looking so grim, then I saw the cake.
That's pathetic that the man is second to the family cat, but also sweet you all hold Molly in such high esteem. Happy birthday to both!🥳
I love the (and tim)
Very cute cat...and cat dad 
Happy birthday !
Tim, don't be a sour puss!
Many Happy Returns!
This really made me laugh
Poor Tim.
The shared ennui forms an impenetrable shield.  Huzzah!
Don't let this distract you from the the fact that in 1966, Al Bundy scored four touchdowns in a single game while playing for the Polk High School Panthers in the 1966 city championship game versus Andrew Johnson High School, including the game-winning touchdown in the final seconds against his old nemesis, Bubba "Spare Tire" Dixon.
That’s awesome I didn’t know it was Molly’s birthday !! Congrats little lady!! That’s something to be happy about!!!! 






.....wait who is that guy holding her?
I thought the dude was called Molly and the cat is Tim lol
Awwww
His utter dissapointment that the cat got the photo and not him

Happy Birthday Molly!!!!! Love your cat tree!

Happy Birthday Tim

Happy birthday Molly and Tim

Everything about this picture is so so great. Words do not do this picture ANY justice at all
RemindME! July 2
Why are the blinds crooked.  Drives me nuts.
LOLOL....who's Tim?
That gray shirt is fitting pretty great on molly.
That cake looks amazing
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Good golly, Miss Molly!
This makes me sad, whenever this happened with me I always played along but it made me feel really bad after. Hopefully that dude is down with it.
He seems soooo “enthused”.
wishing the catto a very happy birthday!
They both look pissed that they have the same birthday
Wow you got a husband, cat, and a child.  Ms. Moneybags over here
F for Tim
Wholesome as fuck happy birthday
You put a baby in her now suffer the consequences Timothy
Happy birthday Molly you beautiful cutie pie I love you! Oh and, happy birthday Tim.
XD the cake
There is no such thing as a 'birthday week' either birthday or birth week, not both.

Btw: cute cat
Maybe he is a cat?
He is jelly
This just made my day
😂😂🤣🤣
Aww?  Fucking cake says, "happy bday cat...  (And Tim)" is a an awww because apparently cat gets treated better?  Wtf..
I wonder if a husband did that to a wife (not put her pic on the cake and top billing), how it would go.
Molly and tim both look like assassins in a standoff
Can't help it but expect the cat to slam the cake with its claw now
What the heck is a birthday week?
Happy birthday sir and to your cutie little cat.
Tim, spray catnip on your dick and at least Molly will be interested
Happy birthday Molly and Tim!
Happy Birthday! Mostly to Molly though.
(And Tim)
Hahahhaa... the face and cake are priceless... the cats face is awesome... whats next, she asks, are we lighting candles or cutting it? Oh boy, oh boy...
My cat is named molly too. A bengal.
Portrait for the ages.
why tim is on "()"?   
oh wait. tim is the guy
Happy birthday Molly!! 🥳 and Tim lol, I hope you both have a good day :)
(And Tim)
Spent a minute looking for the birth mark they shared until I decided to properly read the title :facepalm:
I hope Tim and Molly are very happy together. And you too, I guess...
[dont be ungrateful tim](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/n70vrm/tim_is_just_happy_hes_remembered/)
Happy birthday to both of you. I have a kitty named Molly too!
Well, I see you've got your priorities right!
Oh my heart!! Too adorable!!
I love this.
Tim has the resigned look of someone who knows the score ! Happy birthday to both !
And both look thrilled to share! Happy birthday to Molly more than Tim!
Tim seems genuinely displeased
Molly is so cuuute! She looks like my Honey. ♥️
