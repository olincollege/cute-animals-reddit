Fear me human!!
That look back at the end.  "Are you....done with the back rub??  I do hate you though."
Gerard Butler has a secret life taming big cats
I guarantee you that guy has felt the fury of dozens of animals by this point. Plus, it wasn't facing him, so it was definitely more scared than aggressive
He alternates between liking the petting and needing to look tough. Poor little guy seems scared though.
I hiss in your general direction!

Thats a really good vet.

"That's right, you better walk away."
How dare this video not have sound
As a volunteer for a wildlife rehab center I get to feed the animals we have living in outdoor enclosures awaiting release approval, and the juvenile opossums act just like this. The adults act like wild animals, running away from us when we pop in to switch out the food and water, but the juvies are always causing trouble. One in particular is just an asshole. He sits at the door of his enclosure, mouth agape, trying his best to look big and bad. His canines are impressive but he's not much bigger than a guinea pig so a thick glove is all it takes to defend against his shenanigans. Needless to say, he'll do well in the wild.

Thank you for providing the YouTube video with sound!
I didn‚Äôt realize Russell Crowe became a vet
I hope this caracal kitten isn't just someone's pet..... It's a wild animal.
Cat veterinarian here.  I *am* intimidated.  This dude is experienced with cats and he knows how to keep himself at arm's length.  

But you don't want to fuck with this.
[deleted]
All I can imagine the vet saying is ‚Äúdon't be like that, I know you like it when i pet you‚Äú and the cat is like ‚Äúno I fucking don't I'm wild‚Äú
Babboo!?? He remembers me!!
"im gonna rip your throat!!!, *Ahhhh scritches* heyy I'm serious here!! *Ooooooo that feels good* aight that's it! You about to die *yessss that's the spot"
So Gerard Butler gave up acting and is a vet. Cool.
Babu! You fox eared asshole!
"No! I'm ferocious! Look at me!" Cats are so great. :D
What a grump muffin. I love it.
I AM NOT CUTE NOR CUDDLY

He doesn‚Äôt have to try. Small as he is that guy could F you up.
Kitty would die of shame to know all these people are watching and going ‚Äúawwwww!‚Äù
If there‚Äôs more video pls share the lynx.
That guy is a pro at handling animals. He's got it down to the really small gestures.
I love how the dr. Just nods like ‚Äúyes you are very intimidating little darling boy, yes you are‚Äú
I thought the logo on the vet‚Äôs scrubs was a QR code.
He attac, but also good boye who just wants a snacc.
Cutest meanest little thing
I'm scary!

It's amazing how submissive kittehs get if they think Mama grabbed 'em by the neck.
Why no noise
Good vet!
If Gerard Butler was a vet...
No no an adult Karacal would mess you up, there's a fair chance this little bugger could still do some decent damage
Watch one of those things jump it‚Äôs insane

Wow. Gerard Butler is really branching out these days.
I feel like this post is violating some feline version of HIPAA...

I SAID MEOW DAMMIT.
No pets! i vishus monstr!
I found the owners Instagram now I‚Äôm crying because I discovered this poor baby has died
Tell me, Mr. Anderson; what good is a phone call if you're unable, to speak?
Man is damn good at his job. Stoic and efficient.
Russel Crow is great with cats
Straight up not having a good time.
Literally bigger cats
Vet looks like he's wearing a QR code
I‚Äôm dumb. I know. What kind of animal is this. If it‚Äôs a cat, what the fuck kind of cat is this.
Damn, but I wish this had audio.
[deleted]
WHY IS HE SO FREAKING CUTE
IS THAT AN OCELOT *j
Is Russell Crowe a vet now?
Ahhahah reminds me of my baby sister trying to scare me
You people are crazy. That‚Äôs not a cute little happy kitty. That cat is mad and could easily make that guy bleed a lot.
Thought Russell Crowe was the vet for a sec there
He keeps twisting his neck around to let you know he's One Ferocious Beast and should not be messed with. He's very precious and young, of course, and will grow bigger. That vet is excellent and handled him very well.
He‚Äôs like why aren‚Äôt you scared of me I am a predator
It's Gerard Vetler.
weird looking rabbit
Where is this video with SOUND? I need to hear this baby
I absolutely adore caracals. They're my favorite big cats and they make the most interesting noises.
I feel like he starts to like the petting until he remembers who's petting him & then he gets mad again
What kind of Pok√©mon is this
 No one is going to mention Gerald butler‚Äôs brother
I is vicious!!!!! I is scary!!!!! .....freezes as being touched...... Then hisses like "you knew id kick your butt!!!" lol. I love it
Is that a raichu?
That thing is pissed and confused. Not very aww at all.
I thought it was GB when I first saw this dude.
I bet he dealed with waay worse cats before
Caracal Cat?
I love the end. "Hey fuck you! And fuck y- Hey where'd you go? Oh."
 Love the foot/paw stomping exclamation point ‚ùó
Wish there was sound.
Literally thought that was Gerard Butler for like 20 seconds
try that in a few years
respect my authoritah, ok oh just stroke me again
When cats get angry I think they look upset.

I remember being a kid and approaching one and thought it looked scared. Its growls sounded like it was in pain so I tried to pick it up to comfort it.

I was the one in pain.
I would be intimidated , very intimidated .   Just a baby , but bigger than most house cats .  Look at those paws and the teeth.
I mean you‚Äôd be shitting your pants if you heard the [hissing](https://youtu.be/VPA778_lcOo). On a brighter note, caracals apparently hiss at everything and generally don‚Äôt mean any harm.
"I'm ferocious godammit!"
Roar! ROAR! I'll claw you so help me God! Hey that feels good. Roar! Hey where'd you go? Oh, there you are. ROAR!
"Did you just vaccinate me, you sonofabitch?!"
The final very defiant hiss at the end really gets me. Also the video with sound someone posted was quite unexpected for me. I didn‚Äôt recognize the animal and I‚Äôm not sure what sound I expected it to make, but it wasn‚Äôt the one that came out its mouth.
THUNDERCATS!!!
Ocelot is cuter than cat
This isn‚Äôt a cat. This is a Pok√©mon.
he used the cat "hack" that paralyzes them if you pinch the skin in the back of their neck. It's an adaptation that makes kittens stand still when their mothers are moving them.
Im seriously disappointed there is no audio for this
Nerves of steel for casually petting a frightened adolescent cougar (is it a cougar?)

Being casual probably helps with that.
I love the paw slam.

*I said LOOK AT ME*
is that a Raichu?
I want SOUND!!! They have the most unusual Vocalization. Love the Ear Tufts
He's hissing at anything he can set his eyes on. And those EARS are absolutely adorable!
Well, if they hadn't declawed it I'm sure it'd rip the shit out of him no problem. Bite him! BITE HIM!!
What kind of cat is this?
OMG that slap.  I can't deal with this cuteness 

I want a caracal so badly.
That's a damn Raichu.
The hissing seems to be involuntary for that species:  [https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/life/2016/09/09/meet-bartley-african-caracal-cat/90141350/](https://www.thecalifornian.com/story/life/2016/09/09/meet-bartley-african-caracal-cat/90141350/)

Big feeties
I am a man! I drive a Dodge Stratus!
Some people are asking so ima say it. The cat shown there is a caracal. It‚Äôs a type of small cat which, when grown up, can jump high up and whack birds out of the air. The one shown here is a kitten btw.
Sooo glad that didn‚Äôt have sound. Caracals are very vocal and loud cats
[Squish that cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAGfx7eB3gA)
When did Gerrard Butler become a vet?
I wish there was sound
That‚Äôs a weird looking dog

For real.  The size of those paws indicate claws large enough to rip your nose off your face. Otherwise, aww.
Out of curiosity why do some cat species have long tufts or ear tips compared to other cats?

This vet is the shit. Can you look after Buster, my dog?
‚ÄúAww he‚Äôs so cute‚Äù

‚ÄúI WILL EAT YOU AND YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY!!!!‚Äù
This is exactly how my cat is around other people - but without a leash.
Those are some big feet
I wish there was some sound to this
This would be so much better with sound!
What the hell \*is\* that beast??
I wanna hear the sound on this one
Sound plz
Where's the sound? I need it in my life!
No sound? The audacity!!!! I wanna hear that ferocious baby's meow sounds.
I still think the cat would eat his eyeballs if he collapsed and died right there.
What is this breed called? I have 3 spyhnx cats, but one like this would not go amiss
there are 99999 things i would do to have this vid with sound.
I feel like that little guy could do some damage though? Beautiful animal
A couple of token swipes in there
I has a vicious
I love these ears
What animal isthis
Hehe
Is that a bobcat
When you are a FIERCE animal, but everyone just thinks you look cute...

Can't relate, tbh...
Is that Gerard Butler?
Attack was not very effective!
Why are creatures so dahm cute when angry. I'll cuddle the shit out it. Will probably end up having no face left but it's worth the try
This man has given me the courage to go forward with giving a stray cat a bath.  She was starving, I fed her.  She wants in the house.  She stinks.
I demand audio!
What kind of dog is this?
Discount Gerard Butler is unimpressed
That vet definitely knows how to handle a caracal. Though I hope to goodness the animal in this clip is not being kept as a pet.
Cat from area 51?!?!
that big paw slap was like "Take me seriously, damnit!!"
I've often heard caracals referred to as alien kitties, so all I can think is "THE MOTHERSHIP WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS INSOLENCE!"
Vet tech 101 they all calm down eventually
What's this animal? It's so cute!!
He is intimidating. Anybody who's not at least a little intimidated by that cat has no clue what a cat that size and with a wild animal's temperament can do to a person.
Vets like this are so awesome. Most vets muzzle my dog. His one vet is like "oh, for fuck's sake, take that thing off and don't sedate him next time"
Aww, that is cute, but that Caracal must be terrified at the same time. The reason why they do that trill is to scare predators away, iirc.
Dude has a fuckin QR code on his chest.
Big. Cat. Energy.
That cat would definitely fuck you up good if he wanted to and there‚Äôs little you‚Äôd be able to do about it.
Took me half the video to realize that isn't a QR code on the guys shirt
I see Gerard Butler is doing well.
Those ears are fabulous!

Dude looks like Gerard Butler!
So...that's a kneazle, right?
Every time I've seen this over the years... It gives me a cute attack lol
I thought Caracols were illegal to have as pets because they are more "primal" (more Lion-like) than regular felines...no idea where I got that though and, admittedly, it sounds dumb as fuck now that I think about it.
What is that ? A baby lynx?
I love this kitty so much it huuuuuuurts
This is literally an audio/visual of ‚ÄúThanks, I hate it‚Äù
I have no fucking idea why vets don't wear protective gloves, it's so dumb, my cat deals some nasty damage when she bites.
This rly does make me go "aww"
This needs to have sound
What manner of elvish cat is this and where can I find one???
Love those ears
When you try your best but you don't succeed
The ears!
I'm a scary wild cat dammit! 

That makes him even cuter! My 5 lbs chihuahua Peach tries to act tough too
‚Äúno tOUCH‚Äù

‚Äúactually that‚Äôs pretty nice‚Äù

‚ÄústiLL NO TOU- ooh yeah right there...‚Äù
This is one of the loudest gifs I have ever seen
Well this definitely did not make me go "aww" at all.
These little nasties eat 2-3 lbs of meat a day and if you do try and keep one as a pet, say goodbye to your furniture.  Caracals have zero 'I love people' instincts.  Best to leave them in the wild.
hes seriously underestimating the felines ability to leap up and Alien style grab his head
Probably because it's a wild animal...
He's trying so hard to act like he's a tough guy
i want one

Easy, Bubastis. 

Good girl.
When he pets it its ears start naruto running
What is it? Probably not a mountain cat?
So vicious
That thing could probably fuck a human up.
Caracal. I recognize those [distinct features](https://i.imgur.com/uT9xDFL.png) anywhere. It'll be okay, friend!
At first I was kinda pissed that he wasn't respecting what is still very much a wild animal, but then I realized he was getting it used to being touched so he could administer the hypo.

He knows they play now because they won't dare in the future.
He's cute and maybe not that big, but I'm still a little intimidated. I've gotten serious scratches from house cats before who didn't want to be brought back into the house when they were in danger from dogs or cars. I take even small cat swipes and bites seriously.
Beginning: No! Stop that, you filthy human! 

End: Hey! I didn‚Äôt tell you to stop! Keep rubbing me, filthy human!

"I need an adultttttt!"

Well he is leashed. Plus the man is twitching.
I'm so glad I saw this today. So glad I clicked these lynx.
Trying. More like succeeding. That dude still jerks back when it swips. Let that little fer, get a hole of you with them teeth.
I must be a wuss because to me, the animal looks stressed and I never like to see stressed animals‚Äîeven if vet care is necessary and even if he's just working to get the cat used to human handling. Stress is bad?
I thought that was a QR code on his shirt
I like how he's being friendly mean... He doesn't want to hurt him, just scare him a bit

Didn‚Äôt know Gerard Butler works as a vet now.
I wish I could hear it yell!
His shirt looks like it has a QR code on it and all I keep thinking about is how I wish I could scan it.
Caracals shouldn't be pets. Just because it looks cute doesn't mean it acts cute. Those things can and will attack people.
Odd question but what do you think this guy's profession is exactly? Interested in a career in taking care of animals like this
Imagine trying to be indtimidating and ending up in r/aww
Is that a cat with big ears or some different type of animal?
Why is Gerard Butler dressed as a vet?

Ok so Gerard Butler is a vet in his next movie?
That animal basically acted like stop what you are doing....but seriously don't stop.
So Russel Crowe became a veterinarian after his acting career tanked?
