So do you feed him anything special or do anything to help extend his life?
He could possibly be the oldest cat in the world
Dude contact Guiness World Records. According to Dr. Google, the [current record holder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubble_(cat)) (oldest cat that's still alive) turned 31 years old last May.

EDIT: Holy crap, went to bed last night with around 300 upvotes, now it's over 7000. Anyway, to all the people saying that the oldest cat is 38, I am talking about the oldest **living cat,** which is a different record than the oldest cat that has ever lived. OP hasn't stated when their cat turned 31 nor if they had a birth certificate, so I thought there may be a chance this their cat was older than Rubble.
Wow! Thirty one is an amazing age for a cat! You must love him so much ♥ Give him some pats from me!
Only 90s cats will understand this.
Tiger has lived a longer life than Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin or Amy Winehouse.
Handsome
He sure doesn't look that old.
Wow that's impressive. What a wonderful cat! You must love him so much!
What are you feeding him and where can I buy this fountain of kitty youth?
DO YOU HAVE A BIRTH CERTIFICATE TO PROVE IT?  

That's crazy.
My Max is 17 and in a bad state, he went blind last week and we are fighting various cancers. I have to practically hand feed him now and constantly cleaning the house as he can’t see his litter box anymore. Had a last Vet meeting last night we’ve decided that this is his last week with us. Very sad.
I don't know what a 31 year old cat is supposed to look like but he looks pretty good.
"His feline wisdom is almost palpable."
Verified as 31?
Kudos to you for taking such good care of him! You have prolonged his life for sure.
I hope my cat lives until she's that old. I tell her all the time she's not allowed to leave me. Lol
Damn, he’s older than me.
What have you fed him most of his life?
"In my day, fancy feast was not only fancy, but a FEAST! And my owner could buy it for 65 cents! You kittens today don't know what you're missing out on!"
Long live tiger the great!!!!
I believe you have one of the oldest cats in the world rn. According to Wikipedia (not sure how accurate the list is) you should have the second oldest cat in the world. A cat named Sasha in Northern Ireland is the oldest living cat at 33. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_oldest\_cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_cats)
The oldest cat of legitimate verified age went by the Creme Puff, which died at the age of 38 and 3 days. Its owner had another cat named Grandpa that lived to the age of 35
I want my cat to live that long
My cat is also named tiger and he just turned 17
Look at himmmmm <3 Hopefully I can have my orange for many years to come <3
Happy birthday and many more!
He’s amazing. Lots of scratches for him
You folks ought to elect him mayor.
Doesn’t look a day over 25
Tiger is older than I am.
His fur looks so good for that age, I'm amazed. That's awesome
Holy shit. He's my age and I'm old AF.
Hey all. If you check the Wikipedia page Tiger is now listed. He unfortunately passed away in 2020.
Where is Tiger? Is he safe? Is he alright?
He's a High~~litter~~lander.
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_oldest\_cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_cats)  Looks like Tiger is top 10!  If you have proof, get him into the Wikipedia list!
Our 27 year old barn cat Cali passed away last year. She still had a nice coat and good teeth right up until she died. Deaf and nearly blind but you could hear her ourr a mile away lol
My god, 31! That means he was kicking around back in the 80s. Has definitely earned the right to chase kids off his lawn :)
[deleted]
Congrats Tiger! Keep on going! 🧡
Decent kitty right there !
Such a distinguished looking ginger boy 😻
The most famous feline in Illinois history was the notorious Al Catpone.
What!?! 31!? How the fuck? My cat died of old age when she was 18! What kind of fantastical creature is this? A cat? Think not!
A 90s cat
What do you feed him?
My cat finally passed at 32. Her name was Calico and she was born when my mom was in high school,outlived my grandparents.
I miss her,she was my first pet. I'm looking forward to seeing her in heaven.
Oldest cat in Illinois?? He's more than half as old as the state of Hawaii!
Meowthuselah
Do you have a dated pic with it as a kitten? If so this could be a Guinness world record holder
Is his name pronounced tiger or tiger?
“Let me tell you kittens about the 1980s, PetSmart was in its infancy and you could not paw at fish on an iPhone because they did not yet exist, you had to hope that your humans had fish as pets so you could paw at them while the humans slept.  Life was tough.”
X to Doubt
Bologna.

Probably died 15 years ago when you were 12 and your parents found a close enough match that you didn't notice.
noway? thats amazing.
Wow! Tiger looks amazing.
❤️to tiger
I bet he can still knock the dust off if he needs to! Looks tuff! Prrrrretty boy!!
Looks very polite.
Beauty
Hey buddy!
That’s an old cat
GO TIGER GO
Hey Tiger! You're great! Have a good one buddy!
He's seen a lot of things and knocked most of them off the table.
I will download this picture so he will never be forgotten even if he dies
He remembers what Pepperidge farms doesn't.
Legit had to ask my brother who is a Vet if that was even possible!

Amazing care and awesome cat!

Fist paw Tiger! (m)
Mine just turned 22 and they both are still quite active and jump around. They have definatly slowed down but I just hope I have at least a few more good years left with them. Two sisters my brother gave me a year before HE died so they mean A LOT to me beyond the pet/owner bond.
He was a grown cat during George Bush Sr.'s term. That's crazy. A cat from the 80s.
I’m so proud you, Tiger.
That’s a good looking cat for 31, he looks like a sweet kitten.
Awwww he’s precious lol
You should have his DNA sequenced! Maybe he has a mutation for longer life span.
So you’re telling me this cat was born in ‘88? That’s crazy to think about
Has any issues with Feline Senile Dementia? I have a Tabby who’s 20 and could be this guys twin. Same name even. He appears to have lost his mind and sometimes just meanders about the house meowing at nothing. His health is otherwise perfect.
As an illinoisan and as a 30 year old man. Its an honor and privilege being fellow state dwellers for nearly the same amount of time as Tiger. Is a good kitty. Give him extra pets and scratches please.
Wow! I'm surprised his eyes are as clear as they are and that they aren't cloudy. Looks super healthy and not a day over 12.
Doesn't look a day over 20!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TIGER!!! My girl Cinnamon made it to 24 and I miss her to this day. May you reach many more milestones Mr. Tiger.
Add him to this list https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_cats
Are you sure he's not Tiger 2?  :)
I hope your cute cat keeps on purring for many years to come 😁
How is a cat more than twice my age? That’s insane and I hope to see him for his 32nd.
Looks good for being 31!
31 human years? Wtf
Yay Tiger!  Still very much enjoying my 22 year old feline roommate Molly.

We had to put her brother Floyd down last October,  which was a terrible loss for our family.  I lived with that dashing furry bastard longer than I did with my parents!

Hats off to Tiger - keep on keepin on!
31!! That's incredible. My old boy Chap fell asleep at 21, and we thought hed had a very good innings! 

Here's to Tiger.....long may he reign!
The oldest cat in the world was 38 years and 3 days. Enjoy Tiger now he's still alive! He looks great!
Press X for doubt
He’s so cute!! Aww just want to boop his little nose 🐱
Someone definitely needs to add this fella to the list. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_cats
I’m in Illinois can i please visit tiger
Illinois for life
Hug that boi for me
This cat predates public internet. I hope he has many more happy years!
[This] (https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/79/Otherwise.svg/1280px-Otherwise.svg.png) says otherwise.
Older than many a reddit user.
In 4 years he better run for president
Here's to another 31. I am not joking, I hope he lives that long, as he looks like a wonderful cat.
He's... he's older than I am.
I thought my 18yo was old. Go Tiger! Here's to more record-breaking years!
31😱 amazing! God bless he looks great! He's adorable. My boy Max is 17.
Hate to go Birther on this, but we're gonna need that cert...
[Oldest cat alive is 33!](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_cats) your cat should definitely be on that chart!
He's the oldest in the world according to Guinness book of world record, the current holder died at 30
My oldest lived to 21, he was months from 22. He was blind, deaf and rickety, but he was my boy! This is amazing.
we had two cats make it to 21 each it’s crazy that this cat is a decade older!
My oldest cat is 19 currently, he’s in good health but can’t hear at all...
Maybe it's 31 months and they've just received some very unreliable information.
Holy crap 31.....?!?!?!? Ur telling me he was born in... 1988?
For everyone wanting to know Tigers diet, we have fed him only dry food for his entire life up to a year ago when we began giving him shiba once in awhile as a treat. Tiger still likes going outside and sleeps in the road often. His favorite place to be is on top of the parked cars in our driveway which he jumps up to with no issues. He makes friends with the animals outside and I once found him at the door rubbing up against an adult possum.
LONG LIVE THE KING
Contact Guinness. The current world record holder for oldest living cat is only 29 years old, if its still alive
He looks no day older than 8
Makes me think that humans could live to 200 with zero stress and a perfectly balanced diet
He 100% looks 30.
This whole post smells like bullshit. I know it's bullshit because I have the oldest cat in the state of Illinois. He just turned 32. If you want proof you can just believe me, I even have a picture of the damn thing
Doubt

Edit: Look at my cat who I say is 31 with no proof because nobody would dare lie on the internet for Karma! Lol
31??? At what point does having a cat live that long become a burden more than a pleasure?


Like get a job and move out already
Maybe in the state of existence. What are you feeding him?
The oldest cat is 30 some years old so he maybe one of the oldest cats alive
I'm 2 years late - I hope little Tiger is still alive
2022 in 5 days... is he still alive?
My grandmother had a 37 year old black cat. Sadly it passed away just a few weeks ago. It was blind I'm pretty sure as well.
Is Tiger still doing good?
Hey, I have a cat named Tiger too! He’s only 16 years old, but he is still going strong and is healthy.
My wife and I went into the local shelter and literally bought the cat no one wanted, he had been there for half a year. He was extremely overweight when we got him (22 pounds!). 

His name is Ziggy, and he is currently on a diet which includes a strict regiment of very expensive food, he has lost almost 5 pounds since we got him 4 months ago. I love him so much, great post OP!
\[citation needed\]
He is NOT Dead.  Owner was celebrating his cats 31st birthday.  Stop telling OP your sorry her loss & start saying happy birthday!


HAPPY 31ST BIRTHDAY TIGER !

YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. I'D NEVER GUESS YOUR ACTUAL AGE. 
31 looks great on you!!🥰😻😻❤💋
That cat is not 31yo.
Doubt
Lol I've seen a 30 year old cat and it looked WAY rougher than this. Having a hard time believing that cat is 31 because it looks like he has another 15 years in him

edit: either way I love your cat
Astonishing!  What an intense love you must share after so many years together.
Himbs an old man
Ancient and wise kitter
[You told me that was super kindergarden!](https://youtu.be/jpQuoEnmdMY?t=555)
Happy Birthday to your sweet boy
So impressive.. His eyes are beautiful. I don't even know if making an upvote is enough to express how amazed I am!
I had a Siamese named Sabrina who lived to be 23 when kidney disease got her.  She liked men!  Didn't care too much for girls or women.
He's just 29 for the second time.
That would make him the oldest?
Creme Puff was the oldest at 38 years and 3 days. Gah that's so old for a cat.
Only 80s cats would understand.
Still pretty young for a pzwk VI
Back in my day sonny whiskas was made with real meat, none of that crap they feed me now.
Based on those figures he's going through about 4 years per life. 

4 X 9 = 36

He should have 5 more years left in him! 
Meaning he'll be older than Bob Marley, Marilyn Monroe, and Jesus Christ.
This might sound insensitive but i'm genuinely curious. Are there undesirable symptoms of being such an old catto?
Makes me feel young to know that there are cats in this world who are only 2 years younger than I am (33)
31 in *human years*. God bless Tiger.
I would recommend finding out if he is the oldest cat.  Fox News published this story on  June 4, 2018 about a 30 year old cat.  Tiger might be older.

[https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/worlds-oldest-cat-celebrates-30th-birthday](https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/worlds-oldest-cat-celebrates-30th-birthday)
He looks like he's saying "whhhaatt"
*I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...*
Damn he was 7 when I was born. Jesus.
Any comments from Tiger on him being the oldest cat in state of Illinois?
The world oldest cat is 38 so your really close!
I love boney old cats. Pet them gently, talk softly they just enjoy laying back & chilling.
this gives me so much hope that my baby Tubby will be able to be around a lot longer than I expected. he is 8 and has a lil trouble jumping high, but hopefully he has many years left for me to put him up on the high spaces he wants to be in.
The **oldest cat ever** according to the record books is Creme Puff, who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until August 6, 2005 – an amazing 38 years and three days. The previous record was 30
It’s weird, but also an incredibly happy thought, that there’s a nice cat in the world that’s older than I am.
Cat older than me, Jesus Christ
My lab was 16 yrs old and we put her down just a month ago. Very hard and the vet told us most labs don't live that long. We were lucky to have her for as long as we did. I miss her
If that's the case you might want to contact Guinness Book of World Records.
He's older than I am.
My guy at home is currently 19 and still in pretty good shape. He still does his zoomies every few nights to get his excercise in. His breakfast whining is as loud as ever tho.
I just lost my cat, my best friend and companion during some REAL tough years, a week ago to a stomach tumor.

Enjoy the time you have. I've been totally lost without her.
Wow. Great for you. How many $$ in cat litter over that time? I get it that this is not what pets are about, just curious
What a beautiful boy! I bet his life with you has been beyond lovely.

I found out over the weekend, in the middle of a family birthday party, that my granddad put down the family dog of 13 years. Didn't tell anyone. Didn't tell me and I live right next door.

He had done it days before and I find out mid-scoop into some rice, now frozen there, never making it to my plate, in shock.

She's gone? She was just here. And I didn't get to say goodbye or stay with her.

Last year we had to put down my puppy of 9 years who I raised because of lymphoma. I held him until he was gone on our living room floor.

9 years, 13 years, 2 years, 31 years! All these sweethearts matter. Love them every day as if it were your last.

I love you Lilo! I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye. I love you Calhoun! You're in for it now, bud. 💜
Tiger and I are the same age. My birthday was Monday (the 29th).
He was around for the Reagan administration.
He knows how things are supposed to be.
Thought my cat was old. She died this year.  We had her for 20 years and the vet said she was likely about 2-3 years old already when she showed up one day.
31. Ho-Lee-Shit!

I hope our 17 year old boy makes it that far.
It's weird to think that in my late twenties there is still a living cat that was born before me...
Finally a reason to like Illinois
Wow. My cat is 18. Good to see she could live much longer.
That cat experienced the fall of the soviet union through now...
My cat died today.. Would've turned 3 tomorrow..
What's his secret!? Asking for a 4 legged friend..
The oldest cat in the world too!
Oh my god this almost makes me sad. I had a cat named Tiger that looked just like yours when I was 4 but he died when he was still a kitten :( that was 27 years ago! So my Tiger would have been a little younger than yours.
My oldest cat just turned 21 and she’s going downhill. You’ve been blessed.
Scooter, a Siamese Texas, named as a record breaker at the age of 30 by the Guinness Book of World Records - but later died. The oldest cat ever according to the record books is Creme Puff, who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until August 6, 2005 – an amazing 38 years
Wise kitty! I want to hear stories about his adventures.
He really does look like he has seen some serious shit in his past 8 lives.

"I was there...during the the Feline Massacre of 1887."
My cat, Precious, just passed at 23. I thought she was old.....
I'm sure others may have intimated this but your cat is ooooold.
Usually cats live 7-12 years, depends upon many things.
We had a cat, she lived for 17-18 years, her last 6 months or so life wasn't worth living.
A 31 yo cat it's hard to believe.
Firm what I've been able to find on the web tiger would be in the top 12 maybe 10 oldest cats recorded!!!
Pets have the potential to live such a long time when they’re given the love and care they need! ❤️
You say 31, I say thirty wonderful :)
31 years... I'm stunned. Good for him!! Longest I had a cat was 15 years or so. :(

Cheers to this old gent.
Holy crap.  He's as old as me.
Happy (belated) 31st birthday Tiger, you handsome boy! ❤ May you get all the scritches and treats!
Bet he shits everywhere.
This cat's age is like my age plus my two brothers age combined and I'm 18 years old
My cat is 25 and people constantly act like I'm a crazy person for thinking a cat can live this long. I'll show them this from now on! 

PS: my cat, Patty, went from being wild, to the pound, to a family for 15 yes, to me for the last 9/10..... And has lived outside in the chicken coop (minus chickens) for much of that. Was diagnosed with a type of skin cancer 4 yrs ago And was told she'd die any day, yet here we are. I'm convinced she will outlive me
He looks like he's about to say something important.
What a precious soul, I bet he’s lived a great 31 years so far. Hopefully a few more to come!
Happy birthday Tiger! This is very rare. I hope you'll be with us for a couple years more!
What are the leading theories on why some cats live such freakishly long lives compared to their peers?
May he have many more years to come!
Much love for you my friend <3
If I were a cat food maker, I'd sure want to know whose cat food this guy was eating.
hes probably gonna live more than me sooo...
Apparently, if you want your cat to have a long life, just move to Illinois and name it Tiger; my family got a kitten right around the time my memories in life start, and she lived until...26?  I want to say?  She was great, I still miss her.
According to this wiki page  
"Rubble is now the same age as Scooter, a Siamese Texas, named as a record breaker at the age of 30 by the Guinness Book of World Records - but later died. The oldest cat ever according to the record books is Creme Puff, who was born on August 3, 1967, and lived until August 6, 2005 – an amazing 38 years and three days.Jun 4, 2018".

He's got eight years to beat the (claimed) record, but he is, like some have pointed out, possibly the oldest cat alive right now.
Aweee cute Illinois kitty
My cat is 19 going on 20, and I’m wondering if this 31 year old cat’s back legs still work.
According to what I could find on google, tiger is the oldest cat in the world.
My favorite little girls name was precious she was 15 and still the most agile athletic and intelligent cat I had ever met..my girlfriend came home one day with her hands full of bags and couldn't stop precious from running outside...the neighbors had there Huskies out in there front yard and she accidentally darted right into there yard before she realized they were there...they collapsed her lungs with one bite....she died on my lap on the way to the emergency vet...she was shaking uncontrollably...have serious trauma about this and even tho I feel I been threw alot this still sticks out as one of worst days of my life
Happy birthday, did he have any
30 year crisis?
I love that this post has gone triple gold and has absolutely no verification other than a picture of a cat and a title that is 31 years old. What is wrong with you Reddit.....
He was around during the Cold War. Let that sink in.
Damn I never heard of a cat that old. Basically double the norm
Can we not talk about our experiences of putting down our old pets and just embrace this cute old fellow.  HBD sweet prince
Care to share his diet?

I want to keep my princess around as long as possible.
Christ I thought my 23 year old cat was old when he died. I had gotten used to the fact he was going to die about 7 years earlier. Started to go senile at the end. Would ask to go out and then ask to come back in right away.
Wow! Impressive I'm pretty sure that hes older than nutmeg, which I've heard was the oldest cat.
He's older than me! Way to go Tiger!!
Still a stud!
I think I went to school with that guy.
Be happy and healthy old boy!
Wow!!! You have taken very good care of your cat!!! Tiger is a cutie
What's his diet?
Does he have any teeth?
I had a cat that was 21. So old he basically looked like a taxidermy cat. Tiger looks pretty good.  Now you just need to steal those genes.
For context, this little guy had already lived longer than the average life span of some cats by the time 9/11 rolled around... and that was 18 years ago.
This cat is three months older than me, bloody hell that's fantastic
“Only ‘80s cats will understand this”
What a happy purr machine
Honestly he might be an Animagus
My cat Walter passed a month ago. He was almost 33. He had been ran over, put back together, let raccoons in our house multiple times, found him sleeping with a raccoon multiple times, disappeared for a year, came back, never liked his belly scratched, and he was a good ole soul. I had to put him down because he was suffering from cancer. He went out with a smile on his face! RIP Walter. He may have been the oldest cat in Berkeley California.
It really bothered me that the top comment wasn't a calculation of how many years 31 is in human years.

It's 140 human years. You're welcome I guess.
Awwww. Wow. I wish my Boo had lived this long ❤️ so happy for you to still have your Tiger around!
He's a beautiful boy... the secrets he has... what a awesome buddy... check this out:  oldest cat ever, According to record books, was named Creme Puff. The pet lived with her owner Jake Perry in Austin, Texas, from August 3, 1967, to August 6, 2005 — exactly 38 years and three days.
He looks very well for his age. If he was human, he would be around 116. That’s impressive.
what a good boy
There's a special place in my heart for geriatric ginger gattos.
Very cute meow machine
I can almost give him a voice, 

...It's my opinion, that age is part of the feline condition... It is important to age correctly, in the early 90s as a kitten you needed to think smart...
be good tiger
he knows all our secrets
I LOVE YOU TIGER
Wow.... 31?! I had a cat live to be 25 and one right behind her to 22 but 31!? Happy birthday pretty boy!
The oldest cat I found lived to be 38.
That cats a year older than me.... what the shit.
Handsome gent!
His eyes still look vribant and clear they usually develop illnesses and have terrible sight when getting older but this one looks like he can go another 10years
Congrats and awesome. He's beautiful.
31? What a distinguished old man!
The oldest living cat EVER was 38 years old, which is only 7 years older than yours. He might actually be the oldest cat alive right now.
I don't know why but I think I shut my heart too animals when I was little. I saw my best buddy tippy when I was probably 6or7 he was a black cat with white socks only on his toes and he had a tip of white on his tail Passed away under the dinning room table and I cried for about three days. He was a good boy 💙. I'm 36 now I do have a cat now that I love but it's just not the same. I still miss my buddy. Sorry for the loss of all your little fur buddies.
Way to go, Tiger!
My Pinky lived to be 26 :)
Handsome lad!
He was born in the 1980s?? Hes older than me!
And still handsome!!!
Kudos to Tiger and you.  Two of our girls made it to 21 before checking out.
Me and my so cat is 16 and still runs around like a kitten so hoping she can last this long!!
My female cat turns 16 in September. She still looks like a kitten.
Tiger is awesome. I hope you get a few more good healthy years with him. <3
Tell me your cats diet.
What are you feeding him?
The worlds cutest boomer
I am Sloppy_Tiger and I approve this Tiger.
You should have a few cells of his preserved...DNA analysis may reveal a way to give all cats such health and longevity. 

And, if I may say so, such *savoir faire*. :)
Thank you for this...I really needed it today. My sweet cat is almost 19 and just diagnosed with diabetes. I thought about putting her down for she was so sick, but as I’ve had her almost half my life, it’s a hard decision. We are managing her diabetes after a week ER stay and she’s doing well. This gives me hope that she may have more years left. Lovely cat. Looks quite healthy and happy.

We also have a 15 year old Labrador. We didn’t plan very well and I’m afraid we will lose them both in rapid succession. I’ll be a mess. Going to look for “oldest Labrador” posts now. 😊
Dude every time i refresh theres anothe 1k updoots.
This cat knows what it was like before 9/11 better than I do!
I have a 21 year old feline tyrant I serve. I cannot imagine another decade of this servitude.  


My tyrant is a blonde Maine coon not a orange tabby, orange tabbies are far more loveablr.
God bless him. I had to put my cat down last year we had her since 2011 had to get her fix and finding out she had cancer she had a tumor behind her eye I miss her so much she was my everything I’m still hurt for the decision that we had to do but we had to do what’s best for what I felt she would want us to do because she was in so much pain and suffering but she live through us.
This is beautiful. HE is beautiful ❤️ My family and I owned the oldest cat in Rhode Island and sadly had to gracefully put her down at age 27 (and a half!). She even got a write up in the paper. She was amazing and to have an animal with you that long and stick by your side through so much; they really become a part of you. 

Much love to you and Tiger. Congratulations on having such an amazing kitty, truly the definition of nine lives (and hopefully many more!). Happy belated birthday Tiger!
Doesn't look a day over 20! what a cutie
Cats can live that long??  My cat only lived until about 10 years old (the animal shelter said they thought she was 3 when she arrived).  I since have another cat, but it makes me a little sad to know that my cat could've lived much longer.
Oldie but goldie
Guinness Book of World Records says the oldest cat to live was 38 years and three days old. Hopefully Tiger will beat the record! :)
This fellow's over 2 times my age.

The

# What
He’s 217 years old. Omg.
Wow congratulations on taking great care of him!  I thought my 19 year old cat was a big deal.   I feed her good food and fresh water every day.  Give her vitamin paste and other supplements.   Do you do anything special for him diet wise.  I don't let her outside either.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
Happy birthday big guy!

We also have a ginger Tiger and live in Chicago, IL! He’s only 2.5 years old though. He has a biological ginger brother named Lion and an adopted sister a few months younger with some ginger streaks in her named Bear. 

Tiger is by far the alpha and biggest though. 

https://i.imgur.com/VJhRbrW.jpg
I love him and will donate to any medical bills for him if needed.
What is with Orange cats living for-fucking-ever?
That is not a cat, it is a wizard, pretending to be a cat
Wow he’s older than me.
I’m late to the party but this post made me feel so much better! Took my 12 year old cat to the vet on Monday due to pulling out hair, rapid weight loss, and all over bony feel. It turns out she has hyperthyroidism! That’s totally manageable! She has the same M on her head as Tiger! Long may they live!!
You, his parents, are definitely doing something RIGHT 😻🧡
Jesus christ Tiger has been walking this earth before I was even swimming nut to nut in my dads balls
What r u feeding him?

I have a 19 year old kitty and I would like at least 10 more years.....
What a pretty kitty!
Man, I'm 53 and if my kitty I had 31 years ago were still around...\\

I was just a KID! I mean, I was 22, but when you're 53, 22 is just a kid. Imagine having your best furry friend around pretty much your entire adult life. 

You are SO lucky.
Dang! What good stuff are you feeding him? Is it from the fountain of youth?
I hope all my babies live that long....or forever but 30 some odd years will suffice
How is this man still alive
This may be the most upvoted post I’ve seen personally
If only dogs would live this long...
What I wouldn't give to have had my sweet orange kitty for 31 years :'(
Ayyyye a post from my state! Can you give Tiger some love for me??!!
31??? That’s the oldest cat IN EXISTENCE
Holy shit that cat doesn’t even look that old
He looks wise as hell.
What's the secret? My cats need to know :)
Still a young looking stunner :)
Tiger, you’re the best!!!
Damn I’m 32, cheers Tiger!
Congratulations Tiger!!!!
Wow impressive....i had one go up to 21.....is he still active?
What do you feed him? How do I increase the life expectancy of my furry friends?? Details plzzz!!
I don't know, I feel like it's the episode of King of Queens where he realized his dog has been replaced like 3 or 4 times.
Calling BS
I showed this picture to my cat, and told him not to pull this shit.
He is actually 21 years old. When you were 10 your dad ran over Tiger backing out of the garage.  Happy 21st Tiger 2.0!
How can anyone really know the age of every cat in Illinois
Wow, Tiger looks amazing for 31!
Thank you so much for sharing!  He is my new spirit animal!
holy cow... that's old. has he always being with you?
Once they hit 30 you have to wonder if it’s a cat... or something that has taken the form of a cat.
I had a cat named Tiger. He lived to be 21 years old, had to let him go July of last year. His twin sister also lived to be 21, had to let her go in March. Such good animals. If only their genes could have passed on.

I just worked a really shit week this week. Just got home after a 13 hr day and this just made my day. He's beautiful. Bless his adorable face!
This is the most karma I've ever seen in a single post, good Lord Almighty.
Your cat looks like its immortal
That cat and I are the same age! Go 88ers!!!
Aww he's cute! 
And I'm totally not nearly crying because I see this post on the date where it's exactly 8years I had to put my orange Cat to rest. He was totally healthy at 14years old, except a f***ing tumor on his jaw that could not have been removed.
I loved that cat so much, I still miss him. 
Never bonded with another animal like I did with him...
Is this your cat OP? or someone's you know? any tips?
My Lillian is nearing 20.  She complains a lot and can't seen to keep weight on but she goes up and down the stairs and loves eating so... I hope we're on your path.
Holy fricc that's alotta upvotes in 12 hrs
OP, I was wondering if the cat is still very happy and playful?
Cat don’t crack.
Might be an odd question... does he still have all his teeth?
I love this old man
Old dude finally figured out his good angle after years of wondering how u can take a picture on a phone when he was born before the RAZER craze
My friend has a cat named Cougar who looks similar. I know he's ancient also. 
Maybe the ginger cats are just immortal.
He is so cute 😻😻
I love you tiger
Tell him I love him
He looks exceptionally handsome for his age
that's the 12th oldest cat ever my dude! he adorable too.
Damn this cat is older than me lol
What do you feed him? I'd love to have my cat that long!
This cat is the same age as me.

I don't feel so old anymore
Their life expectancy is supposed to be around 18 years!
What do you feed your cat?
My cat 16 he doesn't seem to be slowing down
You go Tiger
I love the cat
He’s been using his nine lives well
Probably the world. I have never seen a cat live this long and I've had cats all my life. I've seen 25, tops, but 25 isn't really a far cry from 31, so...👍❤️😭 thankfully cats live longer than dogs. Way to go Tiger!
oh my gosh!  This reminds me of my old kitty.  His name was also Tiger.  He passed away a couple of years ago at 20 due to cancer. Sure do miss him...
Looks pretty good for  the oldest cat in Illinois
31 is impressive. I had a cat that lived to be 19 and I thought that was old. The cat was a bitch though, so maybe it just felt long.
Tiger is aging like a fine wine. His food dish is the fountain of youth. May it overflow with eternal feline life always.
Checking up on him is he good
[deleted]
Tiger. I wont cuss. You keep being the cat you are. Hope you live another 30 you beautiful cat.
That cat is more than double my age
Aww he is adorable
Still has 4 more lives left to go!!!
I HOPE HE LIVES FOR GOD DAMN EVER THEN
He looks young for 31!
And he doesn’t look a day over ten! What a good boy ❤️
Epic
Any extraordinary claim made without proof can be equally discarded without proof. I call bullshit.
Does anyone have the heart to tell them their mom replaced tiger when he was 14?
He looks pretty young for being 31.
The oldest cat in Illinois? ... must not be talking about those FAT CATS UP IN CHICAGO! AmIRite!? AHAHAHAHA
I'm turning 31 today :D
X

       Doubt
You know, the oldest living cat according to Guinness, died last year at 30. Tiger could actually be the oldest living cat in the world. If you have his paperwork you could get him a world record!
We sure he didn't crawl outta the Pet Semetary some years back?
The feline wisdom is almost palpable.
31??  Buuuullllll shite 

I need to see some ID please
Just wondering how you know he is 31? He looks great and is obviously an older cat, but unless you have had him literally for 31 years do you know exactly somehow?
That’s 217 in dog years.

Also.... Bullshit.
Had to put our 19yr old cat down last December. She had a great long healthy life and protected our kids like a lion would her cubs. Hardest thing I have had to do.
*O, the wonderful thing about Tiger*

*Is Tiger is thirty-one years*

*He's long in the tooth but he's chipper*

*He'll vanquish all of your fears*

*He's bouncy, flouncy, mouncy, pouncy,*

*Fun fun fun fun fun!*

*But the most wonderful thing about Tiger is*

*He's Illinois' Number One!*
Hey, this is Tigers owner Joseph, he has been in my family since 2001, he was born the late 1980s. Most doctors told us he wouldn’t live another few years, every time he did. Good to see him getting some attention.
I don't believe you
[deleted]
Woahhh I also have a cat named Tiger and they look really similar
Proud to share the same state as Tiger
Wow. His eyes look like he's still pretty aware upstairs too!
OP, it's time to call Guinness Worlds Records!
Aww
Need banana for scale
Congrats, Tiger! 😻🥰
Wow, Tiger is older than me!
That’s greeeaat
TIL there are cats that are older than me.
Damn, looking good for 217!
At first I thought you meant cat years...
[deleted]
BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
holy crap! You should be proud
Every day I hope my cat makes it that long!
I really hope my kitty lives that long.
That has to be the oldest in the world. That's insane.
Wow that’s amazing
I had a cat named Roscoe he lived 18 yrs according to my stepdad who had him since we was a kitten. I miss the little guy age really screwed him over I don't remember what he died to but I think it was some sort of infection and was put down
Hello gorgeous older boi!  I hope my bOb (who is so annoying we think he'll live forever - cute though) achieves such status.  4 paws up :)
Holy shit, my girl at 15 is just a youngster compared to this guy.
Jesus christ that cat is older than I am.
He's very wonderful!
Can you pat his tummy for me he deserves it
This cat is older than me.
Good lookin' cat for that age.  Give him a little pat on his head for me, will ya?
This is so wonderful! WHO'S A GOOD BOI!?
He's looking good for 31.
That's an old cat.
He is legit older than most of the people posting here.

...I mean, not me, I’m old AF, but other people.
How old is that converted to cat years?
Ahh that is great! What’s your secret to keeping him healthy?
Did you count the rings on his tail?
Wow.... That means in cat years he's 249. What an amazing friend!
The oldest ever was just over 38, Tiger may break a record!
As well as the oldest cat in my heart.
NICE
Thats definitely the oldest age I've ever heard for a cat
And most handsome ofc
Oh my he looks great for his age, if you wouldn’t have said his age I would’ve thought he was still a kitten
Tiger I would die for you
Wow don't be surprised if the people from Guinness world record show up
Your cat is older than my husband
Was he adopted at a young age? If so, could you share a picture of him in his golden age? I would love to see him as a young lad lol
Dang, my childhood cat Muffy disappeared at age 21. I thought that was a lot!
He is immortal
I love him.
You sure he's 31? He looks so young!!!!
How long have you had him?
WHAT A SWEET BABY
I'm only a year older than this cat... wtf
That's the oldest cat I've ever even heard of!
Mine died at 8, I didn't think they got older than 10...
Awww hi Tiger!
 when i was small. someone told pet age X3 equal to human.
Is he missing his teeth? :(
Wow!  My cat is 20, and I hope he can be like Tiger!
Wow. In a couple of months he'll be in the top 10 oldest cats *ever*.
The oldest cat in the world died at 38.
holy shit, I thought that my aunt's 22 year old cat was insanely old, this is new !
Doesn’t look a day over 20!
In the state? I think you mean the world, congrats Tiger!
Hooman years?
Your sweet baby is 136 years old! Congrats to Tiger and his loving parents <3.
Go get em tiger
What's his Diet? I am super curious.
Happy birthday tiger. 🎉
oh miau, thats amazing
does he still have his teeth?
Breaks my heart having to let my 16-year-old boy go "so young". Fuck cancer.
Amazing. What do you feed him? Do you ever feed him raw meat?
...that cat is as old as I am
Dam he is holding up pretty good!
he doesnt look a day over 29
That cat is nearly twice my age.
God I hope my lil Jack Jack makes it to 30
He looks really healthy. Congratulations on such a long lasting fur baby
Good looking old boi
Wow
Contact Guinness World Record. So, he can be in the record books.
Our family cat was also named tiger (tijger in dutch). My heart melts when I see other house tigers out there :) he looks like a happy boy
https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/worlds-oldest-cat-celebrates-30th-birthday

OP, you just might have the world's oldest living cat!
To imagine that when I was born, Tiger was already a 6 year old cat just blows my mind.

Goddamn he's lived long!

Here's to hoping he lives even more and in the best of health!
Do you have any more pictures of him? He's extremely handsome!
Vampire cat.
What do you feed him? It's clearly keeping him healthy!
You sure he's not an animagus waiting for the right time to resurrect the Dark Lord?
Tiger is a handsome boy! Thanks for sharing. ❤️
I once had a cat named Tiger that looked just like this kitty. Happy belated birthday, Tiger<3
31, wow! My cat is 15 and I thought he was old lol Do you have any tips for longevity? I would love for my cat to live even another 10 years, let alone 16 more!
So that’s people years right? What’s that in “cat” years? 217 or 231?  (I used dog years) Two schools of thought on that.
31? wow thats insane
Jesus, he's older than me!
 Ill weeds grow apace

but I am truly happy for you and your little fighter
31?! That's incredible and makes me so happy for both of you :)
Damn!! Congratulations <3 What a beautiful old kitty.
Doubt
That kitty don’t look anywhere near like kicking the bucket.
He could possibly be the oldest cat in the world.....?
There is hope for my 21yr old kitty.
Doesnt look a day over 22
nice cat
I'm sorry, 31 in HUMAN years? Wowee wow wow that's nuts! He was born in the Reagan era! Good for you little guy!
Tiger#6
Proof? My cats 39
30 fucking 1. what the heeeeellll?

that cat is so fucking old
Damn, 80's cat comin' through!
Has he lost all his teefies??
Your cat is a boss. Super handsome. You should check if he’s the oldest cat in the world never mind Illinois.
Random but this made me google oldest cats ever.
Your cat could be one of top 10 oldest cats to live & I think that’s pretty awesome
Lots of love to Tiger ♥️♥️
What s cute old kitty :)
31? To be so lucky to have your buddy for 31 years
That cat lived as long as me!
Good looking cat. I’m very happy for you to have a companion live that long. The longest one I’ve had was 19. It was like loosing a child. My oldest son still hasn’t gotten over her. They were inseparable. She was three when he was born. Here’s hoping for many more years for you to spend together.
Happy birthday Mr. Tiger! You are literally twice my age so I better use honorifics.
Hi Tiger
What a love bug, he’s obviously been very well taken care of and loved to live such a long life! Hugs and snoot kisses to Tiger!
31? Really? How?
A cat is older than me. Suddenly I don't feel old.
31?! Holy crap!!! That’s crazy!!!
Truly remarkable.
Iin🤣
My old boy is named Tiger as well.  He's 17.  We will lose him to kidney failure before too long though.  :(
Wow! And here I was thinking my cats were getting old at half that age!
Mine has just turned 9 this week (estimated, we got him at ~5 4 years ago so who knows his real age). I'd fight like tooth and nail to make sure my fuzzy friend gets to 31 in good condition. I can't imagine having him be there for not only my kids being born but all the way through their adulthood.
That's a long time to be the best boy
Omg Tiger you don't look 31,your an amazing kitty! God bless you sweet boy. I had a tabby that lived 19yrs,right now I have 2 Maine Coone mixes and 1 very over weight Golden Retriever, the cats are 10yrs old,1cats name is Princess and she certainly lives up to her name,she only drinks water out of the faucet,the other cats name is Tess she's 20 pounds,Princess is 10 pounds,Tess is the lazy Garfield type of cat and Lacey is our Golden,Lacey loves everyone but that's a Golden! Have a great day Tiger lotsa hugs from Princess,Tess and Lacey,even though Lacey would probably chase you,she chases our cats.
I just turned 31! When is this cat's birthday??
