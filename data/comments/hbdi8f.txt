I'm imagining him telling this story to his dog buddies for years afterward. 

"Damndest thing. It was my last day on the job and I was just about to clock out ... I notice this bag smells off and I sniff it... and, I shit you not!, a million tennis balls just fall from the sky. Hell of a last day, I'll tell you that much."
I love how his brain went from "Oh this might be dangerous' to " BALLS BALLS BALLS AHHASHAHshAHShASha"
Highly recommend you don't give the same treatment to a bomb disposal expert on his last defused explosive before retirement

He was adopted by his handler Keith Gray and will spend retirement at home with his family. Check out this clip of his final bag search and reward! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù
Do you think dogs miss work after they retire?
Wow, he tunnel visioned on the one ball and completely ignored all the other ones. That's impressive, actually.

Does he get a bonus car ride to the park?
#The Treat Locker

***Rating:*** üüäüüäüüäüüä

The newest foreign import from TSAMedia_MarkH, *The Treat Locker* is an intense, but ultimately rewarding swan song for veteran thespian Theodore Tirado a.k.a. TTirado.

Not often are we introduced to thrilling films like this with a plain static camera, but this wise move by the director pays off in spades when we see TTirado entering the frame, searching for his final bag with a sense of energy and urgency that propels the plot forward. It is _his_ mystery to solve, it is _his_ viewpoint that we follow.

As he settles down, we as an audience are left to wonder -- is this it? We are then treated to a grand visual finale, where a series of yellow balls (I want to catch some of those) rain down on him, as he freaks out and runs in excitement. On first watch, I had found the message for this elusive, but later I realized that it was never about finding what was inside the red bag; the yellow balls to me symbolize the release of stress for a detective who knows that he's saved another day.

The Treat Locker could not have been a more perfect sendoff for TTirado, a legend in his own right, and it earns a strong recommen from me.
For the win! Happy retirement!
Imagine the happiness he felt the moment the tennis balls fell <3
What a good boy!
I wonder if he knows he's finding explosives or not? If so, I can only imagine the split second of "of course, last job before I retire and the fucking bomb goes off".
Drowning in the sauce
bally bally oh my golly
What happened to the coke in the bag? Or was that part of the celebration?
SUPRISE THERE'S ACTUALLY A REAL FUCKIN BOMB IN THE BAG
Has a TSA dog ever found a bomb? Has the TSA itself?
‚ÄúHmm... this smells like explo ‚Äî OH MY GOD WHAT IS HAPPENING?‚Äù
Info on the name: TSA dogs with double letters are named after first responders who fell in the line of duty in 9/11. In this case, Ttirado was named after [Hector Tirado Jr](https://www.firehero.org/fallen-firefighter/hector-l-tirado-jr/), a 30 year old FDNY fireman.
So always have some tennis balls with you, if you want to smuggle something.
So we‚Äôre all gonna just forget that he just alerted on explosives and no one took care of them ?!?!




Obvious /s if anyone doesn‚Äôt know
As an owner of a chocolate lab, this would be the greatest moment of her life.  The sheer amount of tennis balls would make her tail helicopter her into the air.  I honestly think she would take a tennis ball over a treat.  Labs can get their hooks in you like very few dog breeds can.  And if you hate all the goop on the ball after 3 throws, grab yourself a chuckit.  One of the best dog toy buys ever.
"Work. Work. Work. Work. ^Ballooms. Work. <Threat detected> - REWAAAAARD! :D"
Now there's a welcome explosion
Thanks for your service, TTirado.  Enjoy your retirement on couch duty.
What was in the bag tho?
A few hours later: ‚ÄúOh shit Bill, did you take the hand grenade out of that red bag?‚Äù
Wtf was in the bag I wanna know
Thanks for the reminder to purchase more tennis balls. For reasons.
My first thought was " What's in the Box? " Like in that Brad Pitt Movie
What‚Äôs said at the end? Is it HANGIN WITH THE BOIIIIS?!
A week's supply of tennis balls is a nice surprise.
My pup would OD on tennis balls if I did this for him
#what's in the bag
The fact he got adopted by his handler is the wholesome icing on this adorable cake
This was amazing!
Just had a thought. At what age and why are service dogs retired? Can they become stressed or even develop PTSD from working so long?
Wait are there real explosives in there and that‚Äôs why the dog sat down?!?! I NEED ANSWERS
How has NO ONE asked what was in the suitcase to get the dog to alert!?!
Defund the police.
All those tennis balls!
That dog has a great last name.
I win ALL the balls.
He knew exactly which ball he wanted.  Good boy.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaannd I'm deaf
This was AMAZING!
*every thing is explodes*
aaaaand now im crying
r/mademesmile
Oh my heart!!!! Good job pupper!
Good doggo
scared the hell out of him
A bag full of COKE! How did you know?!
I‚Äôm not crying
Imagine being that one tennis ball he chose out of all those
Technically it was a bomb..... of tennis balls!
Even dogs have jobs
*sales for tennis balls up at the border
That's so cute!
tennis ball, throw it against the wall
That little sound he makes after he sniffs the suitcase is adorable
balls!!
Oh you retire today? All the balls for you
Wholesome AF. Happy retirement pupper, who's a good boy then? üòÅ
He gets his very own suitcase of explosives!! Happy retirement TTirado!
I hope he got all the treats and pets!
I hope his handler hides things at home for him to find :)
ADAG - all dogs are good
u/vredditshare
Bless his little heart. Thank you
Yay.. so much happy I nearly cried!
So much better than a gold watch!
Yaaaaaay :,)
That dog will have a great retirement with that family.
Imagine taking that dog for a hike and it just sits down out of nowhere
The goodest boy.
Very few things on the internet amuse me to the point of vocal expostulations. Generally when I type "ROFLMAO" what I mean is "smiling quietly to myself." This was a notable exception. Thoroughly delightful!
im crying
:)
Perfect retirement gift, wish I had such a thoughtful gift when I retired.  Zillion times better than a plate........... Happy retirement TTirado......... Bonne retraite mon ami!
THANK YOU for keeping us safe Tirado.
Oh my god. This is so adorable üò≠
Anxiety overload

Which ball to grab
r/dogswithjobs
That is so awesome and him being adopted by his handler is amazing and beautiful happy ending and a new beginningü§ó
Drugs who?
Sweet!
good little dogo
Windfall!
Toys!!!!! Hahahaha
Woo-HOLY FU**ING SHIT WOOOOOO HOOOOO LETS GOOOOO!
What a wonderful way to retire! So sweet!
Good boy.
Look at his tail ü•∫
So many balls, so little time
I has won powerball!
What determines a dogs retirement?
More like this please.
I love it he deserve it he has save a lot of lives.
I want to see more bomb sniff doggo play with BALLZ
What's the average chance of these brave bois getting really hurt by an explosive? It just nreaks my heart thinking that thet don't really get wtf they're doing other than a "oh, shit, this reminds me of the times I got a treat when I was little, lemme sniff some more" and it just makes me sad
I‚Äôve got a family member who regularly travels to military testing grounds to watch things go boom, and I took a suitcase out of their closet to travel one day. 

The suitcase never made it back to the closet, and I traveled with it for a few years without issue. Then one day at a small airport in Kentucky, my carry on is randomly selected to be screen for explosives. As the guy explains that it‚Äôs a simple and routine test, he‚Äôll swab my bag and the machine will beep twice, then I‚Äôll be on my way ‚Äî I start to shit my pants. Then the machine lets out one long beeeeeeeeeeep and the guys look at each other and shit their pants. I try to pretend like I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening and go to grab my bag when I‚Äôm practically bear hugged and told not to touch the bag. I got taken to an isolated area where I began to explain that it was my family member‚Äôs suitcase and what they did for a living. After some skeptical looks, a few more questions, and a thorough search of my bag, I was free to go. 

I left that suitcase sitting in a corner of the garage for several years after that, and one day my roommate accidentally included it in their Goodwill drop off.
Lol he saw the one he wanted and ignored the rest
*happy Keanu noises
He's so HAPPY. I hope he enjoys retirement
What a good baby. Well done ü•∫
I really hope this dog will have a happy retirement.
Dog *heavy breathing*
That is awesome! Everyone should watch this.
See, he knows the world be a much better place with more tennis balls and less bombs.
The little squat with the tail in full wag mode.  If we all just wagged more....
This video makes me so happy. Those pups do hard work. I was once in an airport and there was an officer planting things around so they could test the dogs. The officer planted something at the table I was at and told me about it. I found myself singing ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be suspicious, don‚Äôt be suspicious‚Äù and all three of the dogs passed. It was the most fun I‚Äôve had sitting at an airport by myself.
This made my day.
In a world gone mad this dog is the hero we need
r/dogswithjobs
Nice
What a lovely dog:)
Now THIS is how you retire!
ok why am i crying in the club rn
When he sits & wags his tail is he indicating explosives?
That is so cute! Will be be staying with his handler‚Äôs family or is he finding a new retirement family?
What is the guy saying? Is it ‚ÄúGo get the toys!‚Äù?
How does an agency (handler?) determine when a sniffer dog should be retired?
"Everyone liked that."
A good retirement for a good boy
This warmed my heart
Thank for your service buddy! Now it's time to enjoy the good life!
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen today.
#THAT'S ENOUGH TO LAST HIM FOREVER
Why did this make me cry lmao
Good dog!
I hope to one day be this excited for something in my life.
Vibin!
That is awesome!!!
Thank you for making my day good boi!
That is a great send off!
This made me happy.
Hermosoüôè
 Bloomin love dogs!
I'm so happy for him I can't stop crying and Idk why ü§ó
Aww his tail! He‚Äôs so happy!
Imagine adopting him and when you are going to get in your car, he sits.
"EVERYBODY LIKED THAT"
What good boy!
Everybody liked that.
Peak richness in dog society
Thats the best thing I have ever seen!
So what triggered him?.....
BOOM!!!! üí•
THE GOODEST BOY AWARD GOES TO....
How accurate are bomb/drug sniffing dogs? I always thought they were just commanded to sit by their handlers.
The best boy!
That‚Äôs awesome!!  Good boi!!
I would award gold to this dog if I had any
Who‚Äôs a good boy
u/winters_red good oldd doggo.
Saw this on Daily Dose of internet, so cute!
Cuteness overload ‚ù§
Awwwww
They should have it dog treats in the suit case
Omg that tiny bork is killing me
So sweet!
Not all dogs are good boys




Some are good girls.
BALLS

LITERALLY
Would‚Äôve been awkward if he didn‚Äôt sit...
HE IS NOT JUST A GOOD BOY, HE IS THE GREATEST BOY
Isn't the military and/or police force just THE GREATEST guys?!?!?! Look, cute doggies!! üòÑüòáüê∂
Adorable!!
So is no one going to check the bag? Clearly someone set up a ball drop to distract the dog.
[removed]
Unfortunately there was a bomb in the bag, and if the dog wasn't distracted by all the tennis balls many lives could have been saved.
Source: my twisted sense of humor
Fun!!!
Well now I need to go hug my dog
My cold, dead heart needed this more than I realised...
So did they put a bomb in that suitcase at least?
Imagine your taking that dog on a walk and just starts randomly sniffing bags all the time
Notice how the dog just sits?

Notice how the dogs on Cops and Live PD usually just put their nose into an area, and that's what the officer uses as an excuse for probable cause?

Weird how that works...
"ah so if you bring a bomb to the airport just dont forget a couple tennis balls" - isis probably.
They should do this for retiring human bomb squad members too. See how high they can jump.
Wait, was that big filled with explosives lmao
Nark!
Lmfao When those balls dropped he totally forgot what his job was!!! Good Boy!
He got an "explosive" gift in his last bag
Finally hit puberty?
Anyone else reminded of Bunny Rabbit and ping pong balls?

What a good boy this pup is! I hope he had a long and happy retirement.
By the way your a very good boy, also fired.
He probably thought he blew up at first
They put explosives in the bag to surprise the dog?
Aaaw. I wonder how many innocent people went to jail because they signaled him drugs.
I wonder if he understands what a bomb is because if he does, I don‚Äôt think dropping a bunch of tennis balls is a great way to surprise a dog... imagine doing that to a human bomb tech... he would crap his pants.

Don‚Äôt worry, I know he doesn‚Äôt get it and it was all excitement.
Ohhhh.... I wanted cocaine...
how many explosives has he found?
Did it........... Go off?
I bet that dog thought that bag was suspicious looking because of all the balloons around it. He knew something was up for sure
I wonder if he will get bored after a few weeks and start double dipping his tennis ball and dog treat pension while working for the DEA.
Idiots! Now we know how to beat the drug dogs!
so what you're saying is anyone with a bag bomb just should bring a bunch of tennisballs?
Wow they didn‚Äôt even let him keep the cocaine!?
I wouldn‚Äôt have expected tennis balls to distract a dog with his job
v c
Wait, are there explosives in that bag to get the dog to that spot?
Does that mean they put a bomb in it?
he‚Äôs a good boy
Am I the only one that thought this final gift was üí©üí©
What did they put in the bag?
Oh my god this is awesome
Now he has plenty of balls to lick in his retirement
Omg I love this so much
I read that as explosive diarrhea. I expected something *completely* different.
Tennis balls are like crack for dogs lol
So are their explosives in that red bag then?
Is there more like this?
TIL If your bomb is being searched by a explosive detection canine, drop a bunch of tennis balls on it to distract
Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to work somewhere that you‚Äôd have the time, energy and resources to throw a party for a dog lmao. What a life that would be
What bag boss?
Its a creeper aww mannn!
Imagine being an explosives expert and being surprised on your final mission.
My girlfriend's dog loved ping pong balls, so she bought an entire box of them for her. She surprised her by dumping it out, thinking she'd love it. Instead she absolutely freaked out and is now terrified of ping pong balls.
Dog almost died of a heart attack.

What a fucking thing to do.
Cute, but may I ask how many times he's gotten a hit that prevented an attack?
My heart just dropped just by seeing that
they put a bomb in that bag so they could drop tennis balls on a dog?
Im glad the government has money for this, but if you dont have health insurance they will let you die
Wait so there's a bomb in that bag right?
!remindme 1h
What a sucker , your saying all I gotta do to get some contraband through is drop a few yellow boys behind me ? !
Kinda hoped it would be a big bomb that exploded.
I don't know, I think the balloons might have given it away.
I thought the bad was going to blow up..
What happens if after he retires the owner is walking someplace random and the dog sniffs and sits at a bag? I guess the owner calls the police, right?
How did they get the dog trained to detect explosives to indicate that bag i wonder.....
What's the average length of service for service dogs?
[deleted]
Now he will think that he have done something bad because after the balls fell he will retire
Toop
Taxpayer money well spent
Dawwwww a dream come true üò´üòç
Was I the only one waiting for that suit case to explode?
Wow now I know how to get those damn bomb dogs away! Lifehack
I'm so happy he got his reward before he exploded.
How to distract a bomb dog rule #1.
So they put a bomb in the bag?
For a moment, I thought that she was going to get two pounds of semtex to play with in her retirement.
it is so cute and also please sub to my username on youtube very cute dog
Well... Now I know what to do if I need to take care of some....business
Not a great pension, but hey at least it‚Äôs something.
Open up the skies!
i don't think i have ever seen a dogs mind so blown. it seems to startle them at first been then they are like well, yolo, time to get to chewing
Why do service dogs retire? Is it strenuous in old age for them?
So all I have to do is distract the drug sniffing dog with a tennis ball? Got it
Ok great now I know what else to put in the bag...
Glad it didn't end with a bang.
when travelling, bring tennis balls, gotcha.
"Detection dog got fired for leaving training objective unattended being distracted by tennis balls"
Do dogs that retire get put to sleep?
Whenever you got explosives with you at the airport, remember to bring a tennis ball.
What was the drug in the luggage??
Reddit: where cops get down votes and cop dogs get gilded
Buen chico!
the real question is... what's in the suitcase?
When a dog gets treated better than you at work. Feelsbadman.
‚ÄúAnd awesome reward‚Äù ‚Äúhey look at this ba-‚Äú BOOM
Yo so why they planting actual bombs then. Who tf got explosives.
Now I know to distract the detection dog the next time I need to smuggle something :)
Weeb Spy's final form
I thought it was gonna blow up
Is it me or does he follow after the very first ball that touches?
*explodes*
no such thing as rewardx or not
How I wish I was that happy to work and get that kind of reward.
Wait, so what's in the bag? The dog found a bomb...
/u/stopfightingthedog
You know those jokes about a dog (usually bomb-sniffing or other service dog) bringing an adult toy in the worst time? My friend Kat actually had that happen. No big deal until the dog wouldn't give it back (let go, he thought it was a tugging game). How does it relate to the balls? dropping a dozen or so near him is how she got him to release it.
Doesn't that mean there's a bomb in that bag??
He is trying to fight his own reflection?
Also 14 year old girl. You got this!

üòãüëèüòã
So ... what the fuck was in the bag?
Fired for lack of discipline!!!
This is what he thinks bombs do now
Next time I am up to no good - I'll keep my bomb in one bag and then have another bag full of tennis balls.  When the dog gives a positive on my bomb bag, I'll unleash the balls and run away with the bomb!
The amount of love humans have for dogs is amazing.
Guys! Guys, bomb bag here!........ BALLLLLLLLLLLLS! *leaves bomb*
Trying to give him a heart attack right before he gets to retire?
Seems wrong to startle an animal trained to sniff out bombs on their final day. Might as well throw a can-o-snakes spring loaded in a birthday present while you're at it.
Was... Was there drugs in that backpack?
"Hey joe, why did you bring a bomb into the office today?"

"Oh you know, gotta suprise the dog before he retires"
* **TNT**irando!
Lab heaven!!
r/dogswithpensions
The dog be like "All these balls yet they took mine away"
/r/MadeMeSmile   :)
Stop training dogs to find drugs, start training dogs to find corrupt politicians.
Oh no. Now the terrorists know their weakness.
‚ÄúI missed one lousy tennis ball attack, and they fired me!‚Äù
Somebody set dog up the bomb
So cops are cool when they have dogs?
Its nice to know that if I ever need to, I can distract the police dog with 500 tennis balls.
I wish they would pan to the side to an annoyed passenger just like "can I get my bag back now, I'm going to miss my flight"
Carol Baskin didn‚Äôt answer his question... yes.
Every single holiday a dick in a box!....
I suppose u could say he had a blast
What's with all the gray balloons? - the dog, probably.
I sure wish we could train dogs to detect corrupt politicians and dirty cops! If they can detect cancer certainly there's a way!
Wait so could someone just spill a load of balls in an airport and bring an explosive in? Isn't that a bit dangerous
so there were explosives in there
How disappointed is that dog going to be when in the field he finds the drugs but no balls will drop..... no balls will ever drop again. It will cut him to the very core of his trust center. Time will pass. He will try to tell him self he‚Äôs over it. But with every bust and no balls he become more hurt, more jaded, harder. Eventually he starts drinking cause he can‚Äôt take the overwhelming sense of despair and rejection day in an day out. Why did the balls stop? Was it me? Was I not a good enough boy? Confused,sad, angry and lost in his own self loathing he turns to the bottle. He becomes despondent and distant. Won‚Äôt play catch with his boy. He‚Äôs abusive to his wife and kids. Eventually he‚Äôs drinking all day. Starts snorting more than he‚Äôs sniffing, finally he snaps and bites a child at the airport because, in his drug induced paranoia, he mistook some powdered sugar for cocaine. He‚Äôs booted off the force and put down for being a very bad boy. 

And all because the balls didn‚Äôt fall.......

Think about it.
... But, what's in the bag?
And then the bag fucking explodes
"There's no way that‚Äôs got electrolytes!
I thought the bag was going to blow up for his ‚Äúretirement ‚Äú
So... there's a bomb or cocaine in that suitcase right?
i think you scared him also nice
Do dogs get 401k‚Äôs?
Then you‚Äôll BOTH enjoy retirement
*Bag explodes*
Now we know, tennis balls defeat bomb detection dogs.
Applause dog style!
Better than a stupid glass plaque
If you tried this at the airport, I think perhaps the humans would notice.
This is horrible! You let him search 1 more bag where he finds a massive hoard of tennis balls and then never let him do it again!
What's in the box!?
Can anyone someone please edit this to make it look like it explodes instead of tennis balls, then when the smoke clears he just sitting there like Wilie e Coyote??
it's a good idea about traning dog to distinguish dangerous things
Looks like he has at least another 5 years in em
I was expecting the case opening and it being full of treats
so if there was a bomb in there
I too put Semtex or Plastic explosive In my gifts
Wholesome
Does he finally get to do the coke
twice I've had cocaine on my person, only a couple of grams, and dogs in airports haven't sniffed it off me when brought right over to me. They're not as good as we think!
Nice tool of oppression there!
So... no one worried about the explosives in that bag then? lol
POLICE dog???!?! What an absolute outrage! Defunct this dog NOW!
When her time comes, instead of injecting her, they should finally let her fulfill her life's purpose of finding an actual bomb.
Did he get to keep the cocaine in the bag n all?
what is the point of the vieo?
Awwww! I wonder if he knows that he's used to accelerate warrantless searches and that his drug sniffing capabilities are slightly less accurate than flipping a coin
Did.... did they put a real bomb in that bag?
That‚Äôs w weird bomb
Those violent police officers.... what if he would of been hit and crushed by the tennis balls!!!!
