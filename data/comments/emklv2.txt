Thank you to all the people who have been saving the animals in Australia. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Along with monetary donations, I have seen a donation page where you can knit, sew, or crochet little pouches for bats, koalas, and joeys and send them to a place in Australia. I don't know the exact site because my boss showed me, but she just googled it and found free patterns and a place to send the donations.
Is there a place where we can donate to help with their care?
...does that mean all their mommies are dead? üò≠
It‚Äôs like an episode of Friends but every character is Joey.
This is absolutely heart melting <3
Poor sweet souls, I hope their mamas survived too.
I think those are Wallaby Joeys, but still cute all the same!
I will never forget when I touched the fur of one and petting him. I expected the fur to be hard like horse hair but it‚Äôs extremely soft like a cat. I was so surprised. I think they are beautiful. So sad for all the animals in Australia and I made a donation. These animal rescue groups are so important and need all the help they can get. Thanks to anyone who donated during the hard times.
I regret that I have but one upvote to give.
SO SMOL
Baby kangaroos are called Joeys and if you want to help there's organisations which make those little pouches https://www.wires.org.au/wildlife-info/wildlife-factsheets/making-possum-pouches
At least they seem to be settling in okay.
I think it's lovely they're being saved but how are they going to eat between now and when the plant life bounces back?  How long does it take for a eucalyptus tree to put out leaves again?  I'm hoping most of them weren't burned up completely.   Maybe kangaroos are omnivores but many other creatures there are very limited in diet.  Koalas only eat eucalyptus after they are weaned.
Must boop
Omg, I love them!  Those swively ears.
they're the future of Australia
Something tells me the kangaroo population will bounce back in no time.
I just want to hug em all ü•∞
I‚Äôm know I‚Äôm saying it to an empty room at this point, but those are actually wallaby‚Äôs

Incredibly heartbreaking either way though
^(I've seen a lot of cute animals saved. What about the snakes, lizards and spiders?)
The collective noun for kangaroos is a **mob, troop, or court**.

So you're looking at a **mob of joeys**.

Or a **mob of roos** to informal firelanders.
Something tells me there is going to be a huge amount of rescued animals released back into the wild that have little to no fear of humans.
They‚Äôre all cozy in their pouches!
These (or at least the ones with white stripes) are wallabies
Happy for them, they are lucky ones. I saw a lot of pictures of animals getting severe hurt in Australia fires early today, can't imagine how much pain they are going through. Don't know to do but really hope more of them can be rescued and survive.
They don't deserve this tragedy. This is heartbreaking üíî
Dude. I keep seeing these kangaroo videos and am starting to trip how human these buggers are.
*‚ÄùAwww shit y‚Äôall escaped too? Let‚Äôs go baby!*‚Äù
To everyone helping the animals in Australia whether you're fighting the fire or helping nurse the young, you got my respect. <3
Overload cuteness
This honestly made my day! Thank you for sharing!!üíó
Poor guys. Thank you for helping them. 

Sending love to all of you in Australia. XO
The most precious moment of their lives. A second chance in having a normal life.
Whilst they don‚Äôt have their mums anymore atleast they are able to start their own mob together.
So do the moms just eject passenger and run off?
These little angels have no idea how important they've become. I hope they're well cared for.
"Gee, everyone's dropping off their baby roos here."

"Yeah mate, we're getting mobbed."
omg my heart üò≠üíî so happy these bbs are alive but so sad how they have no mammas
Kind of a moot point, but these are wallabies, not Kangaroos. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is the same tub (and joeys) from The Agile Projects videos:
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5vgXYP2TM

EDIT: here is their website if anyone is interested in keeping up with these joeys in particular, or donating to the organization https://www.theagileproject.com.au/

The joeys names are Andrew, Geoffrey (in honor of two firefighters that died fighting the fires), Chris, Ash, Margot, Celeste and Rebel (after Aussie celebrities that have contributed to relief efforts due to the wildfires).
I want them all! üòç Poor little babies üòî
Baby Roooooooooooos!
Seeing only about 10 out of 100 still breaks my heart so many species perished and even though so many were saved my heart still hurts
[deleted]
So cute. So sad. Keep donating and raise awareness. These animals don‚Äôt deserve our atrocities
These are adorable baby hopdogs
Super cute and super sad.
Mom: "You guys doing okay in here?

Body Yodas: "Yeah, we're good."
Kawaii desu ~~
I believe the correct name for them is "How you doin's"
Please tell me you're going to raise them and make a kangaroo army!
Well, I‚Äôm not Australian, but I can say this. What your country is going through is terrible. And it‚Äôs the Amazon all over again. You‚Äôre being ignored, even by your own prime minister! (Or so I‚Äôve heard) I‚Äôm really glad that you all are trying your best to save these creatures (even if they are bastards). I just hope everybody in Australia will make it through this. The work you people are doing is kind of under appreciated, but I‚Äôm here you give you my full admiration. Thank you, and stay safe. Mates. (Ok, don‚Äôt know if I should say that, but I‚Äôll do it anyways. Mate)
I like how they‚Äôre all just calm like who cares that I‚Äôm in somewhere I‚Äôve never been before. You put me in a pouch and I‚Äôll chill.
I'd be on petting overload.
They‚Äôre so cute until they grow up and punch you in the face. Kind of like humans.
Are they all friends?
I think these are wallabies. Don't know if I spelled it right.
I love how they're all just sitting in their pouches. They seem like they aren't trouble makers, but I'm sure they must get up to some kind of shenanigans.

My coworker has been working nonstop to make tons of pouches and ship them over. This video makes me happy.
Such cute little creatures.
Awww!! I love how they're all in their little pouches. Thank you so very much to all the rescue teams that saved these little Joeys.

What a joyful scene, bless them all little one may the live long and produce more younguns.
They're called joey's mah dudes

I hope they are safe and healthy :)
I'm from Perth, Western Australia but I usually live in Canada. Seeing all this generosity has really melted my Grinch like heart and I just everyone who has done this for these precious little babies.
Aww
Awwwwwwwwwww
Aww so cute mouses

Just to be sure I get this right. All of these have individual mothers that either died or abandoned them, right?
I'll fosta a roo!! ....or TWO!!

I see a lot of Joeys but no Chandlers
Dont want the meal to get overcooked
Waits for someone on Reddit to post why Kangaroos are bad animals.
That's a lot of joeys!
But where is the mother? Please tell me she is fine.
Aww this really brings a smile to my face! Big thanks to people who rescued them and people who made these lovely pouches ‚ù§
Soon to be stomach shredders. Get out of there while you still can.

It is a pouch puddle.
I‚Äôm really happy that some people do care about these kangaroos but I just want to sprad awareness here that in some part of Australia they‚Äôre planning on culling 10,000 kangaroos. Reasoning? Food and water scarcity. In any case this is far too extreme a step. Humans should take responsibility, but this isn‚Äôt the way.
I‚Äôll just *grabs one then runs away*
They are chilling
I support the effort, but I'm also curious about what happens with all these kangaroos and koalas who like hanging out with people? Is that even a problem?
Working at a animal shelter in the past I could only imagine how much clean up there has to be with these little guys. So many peed blankets and poops üò≠
That's so adorable
cute little joeys
They're called joey's
Can we put out these fires also for Steve Irwin? He loved all the animals in Australia

Why only kangaroos get rescued? There are a lot of innocent animals our there. They all should be rescued!
Most adorable thing ive ever seen on reddit. Thank you!  I can now sleep better for a night!
This is just so fuckin sad

I bought a shirt for MMA with a koala on it and the back says ‚Äúfight for Australia‚Äù it‚Äôs a 50 dollar donation but I‚Äôd love to wear that proudly when I compete.
Is the fire in Australia that bad? I asked a question once about the raging fire that was happening in Brazil last year if it was contained or still going. All I got was "it's always burning somewhere."
Australians should arm emus with water hoses and let the emus beat the fire; they have time and time again proven to be the dominant species in Australia
#NIPPERS!
They are so cute! God bless them all
It breaks my heart that we even have to see posts like this. I‚Äôm so thankful for everyone who is helping all the animals as well as everyone fighting the fires!
Their eyes are so beady
Save the koalas! Save the roos!
Kangaroos live in the wood?
I missed the s in kangaroos. I thought how cool someone saved a kangaroo.. was not expecting that large gang. What a happy way to start the day

YOU ARE A HERO
The thought of any animals burned alive is so sad and terrifying
So precious.
Bless these beautiful babies.

I'm guessing these are wallaby joeys. I might be wrong tho.
Aww but sad at the same time... :(
They look like a cross between rats and rabbits.

But where are their mamas? :(
Hero among us
I like how they can turn their ears like satellites
Not gonna lie i was hoping to see way more little roos.

How horrifying. NOt that I think this is all the roo's saved. BUt just horrified about how many must've not been so lucky.
This is why I still live, thanks for all your hard work!

I am both disappointed in a countries leaders  who doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the animals on its coat of arms and proud of the people going out there saving them.
It's cute, but dang I can't help wonder if this is a glimpse of the future of animals altogether. If things don't change I mean.
Isn‚Äôt it Australian fires and not Australia fires?

What are their chances of ever being let back into the wild?
I just heard from a friend that kangroos are killed in Australia. Is it true ? 
If it is, how long has it been going on for ?
This looks like the baby from Eraserhead
You don't change the world by saving an animal (or a few gorgeous baby kangaroos in this case). But you sure as hell change the world for every animal you save.   
All my repsect and love to the people who keep those non-human animals safe.
I wish some people would receive such care

Why only the baby?
Poor sweet babies!

Upvote and saved gonna go do a save
Wildfires/forest fire will replenish the soil.
So cute
My mum and her friend are making lots of these blanket pouches for them! So cute to see where they go
I‚Äôll take all of them.
I guess we will soon see evaluation of kangaroos similar to that of wolves to dogs
Say what you want about the state of humanity but now is a great time to get a new exotic pet.
These are actually baby wallabies!
It‚Äôs a pouch party!
Awww I love them!!
they are killing camels #savecamels
YAY!  Hugs to all the baby roo's.
They should set up an adoption clinic where any adults who escaped can come pick up a replacement joey.  : )
Joey's is the correct term
The left one? This is how fires start
This bucket of baby kangaroos is so cute, it makes my chest hurt.

Where are all these kangaroos gonna go after the fires.

Aaaawww <3 Its terrible what happened in Australia...all those fires...so sad...
Pretty sure those are wallabies.
I can already imagine how many fights you have to break up with this many when they get older they always boxing with each other you gonna get busy
Lol idk why this looks funny
As my daughter would say "BUBBY!"
They're so chill.
So cute
But what happened to all these babies parents? Where's their mamas? Don't they chill in their pouch at this age? I have so many questions.
They are so cute Lul
If I'm being completely honest aren't kangaroos pests? Not saying I don't support saving animals but I feel like kangaroos are on the low end of the animals to save.
This is so cute an makes me happy but also super sad about Australia.
I read shaved so I was confused by why someone would do that
I genuinely want to understand why they are killing camels and saving kangaroos. Can anyone explain without being judgemental?
All these kangaroos are cool and all, but what‚Äôs the long term solution for these guys?  Where are they supposed to live?  Will having them assisted by humans impair their development?  Are kangaroos classified as pests over there like deer in the US?  But seriously where they gonna go once fires are out?
aw they're in POUCHES
Aren‚Äôt they the cutest?? :))))
It's heartwarming to see so many rescues. First I was sad at how many babies were there, then I realized how great it is so many were saved. (Doubtless many more by good peeps!)
Seeing all these rescued animal videos from Australia, im under the impression theres only kangaroos and koalas that exists there.
They're like weird dogs. So cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
My god, they're planning to take over with an army of trained kangaroos
In art at the moment we're making little joey homes and baby bat beds
The videos have been heartbreaking to see. Thanks for posting one of the sweeter moments!
I‚Äôm so proud of this community
They don‚Äôt even know the hell they have been saved from, happy little kangaroo creatures.
You legend
Where they mamas ;-;
Uhh... Can i have one?
They should have saved the adult ones and put the babies in their pouches..
Georgie‚Äôs got the Ricardo smirk
What happened to the momma's? Did the babies fall out of their pouches or something?
So cute

Are these wallabies? They look like wallabies.
What does that sound like?
I wonder if this disaster will bring the animals and humans closer. Almost all animals now will have a good experience with humans and may be less likely to be scared or defensive towards them
Where are the adults
I want in on that cuddle puddle
It just donned on me how recent the amazon fires are, and how fucked the climate and the ecosystem is with this new fire

May have already been asked but will they be able to be released back into the wild when things are hopefully finally under control? Vibes and prayer to the people and marsupials and all of those in the path of the fires.

Where are the mama kangaroos?
This is ao adorable .. how they are sitting in bags x) but it's so sad too T.T
So Kangas abandon their Roos when threatened?
Yo where can I sign up to house one in the US and when the fires are gone send em back? Asking for a friend
Quick almost useless tip: those aren't baby Kangaroos. Baby Kangaroos are slightly bigger than a Chickpea
Bro you are a hero you saved them from the wm1 f2p pyros
Give me all the baby kangaroos
Babyroos, babyroos, baby rooooos!
But let's not forget the fact that over a 100 die for every one that's saved. The government need to put in more effort and funds into firefighting. This shit isn't getting any better

did their mommies not make it? :(
After the fires are done Australians and the animals are gonna have a zootopia like integration were the humans and the animals are apart of the families, cities, towns and villages. It‚Äôs gonna be so epic.

Jim Casey - Fire Fighters Climate Alliance Representative

March On Morrison, 21st December 2019
‚ÄúI'd like to thank Uncle Vic for his Welcome to Country. My name's Jim Casey. I‚Äôm a career Firefighter. I'm here today as a representative of the Fire Fighters Climate Alliance. We're a loose network of Firefighters who can see the link between climate change and our workplace, and we're trying to do something about it. 

So look where are we at with this fire crisis? Right now there‚Äôs over 200 fires across five states. We've lost 3.1 million hectares in New South Wales and Queensland alone, 800 homes destroyed in NSW. We've got 8 dead, including two of my comrades from The Rural Fire Service. This week we saw the record for the hottest day broken three times between Tuesday on Thursday. It's now at 41.9 degrees. This is unprecedented . 

In the 20 years I've been fighting fires, I've never seen anything like it. So why is it so bad? The fuel load is high. The drought has made it very, very dry, and the conditions overall are perfect for fire. The higher than average temperatures have meant that the window for hazard reduction through winter was smaller than anyone would have liked. Which means that we're facing a devastating fire season not as prepared as anyone wanted. But it's the extreme weather associated with global heating, which really nails this. It's not so much the one degree average, it‚Äôs those days with very, very, very high temperatures. It's the high wind, it‚Äôs the dry lightning, it‚Äôs the fact that CO2 in the atmosphere acts as a kind of super charger for plant growth. So you end up with a situation where your fuel load is not only dry, it's actually bigger than it would have been otherwise. All of this acting in concert is what's giving us the crisis we are facing today. 

It gives us fires like the Gosford Mountain Fire. That fire is almost half a 1,000,000 hectares burnt now. It stretches from Lithgow where I was born out to the Central Coast hinterland. It's actually got it‚Äôs own weather system, and here's the truth. We can't put it out. Firefighters can not put that fire out. It‚Äôs the weather change that will stop Gosford Mountain. We'll be working around the fringes, trying to save life and property, but the fire itself can not be put out. 

So what to do about it? I'll give you my perspective as a firefighter? The first thing is resourcing. We need to see the $20 million of cuts to Fire Rescue New South Wales, currently on the governments books, that obviously needs to go. It's ridiculous, but getting rid of those cuts aren‚Äôt enough, we need more money in all of the three services that deal with fires, Fire Rescue, The Rural Fire Service, and don't forget the National Parks. They're specialists are extremely good at what they do, and they‚Äôve had significant job cuts over the last five years. Give it up for those boys and girls. 

The second thing is to do something for the volunteers. You can't expect people to leave their jobs and their families for days at a time over a period of months, which is what these fire conditions are going to lead to. And to do that without any kind of financial support, financial compensation. You can't expect employers to carry it. If you're running a small business in Kickatinalong and your sort of leading hand is taking off to fight fires. It's a problem for you as well, and I got sympathy for that. 

We are one of the richest countries on Earth. We can afford to sort this out. We can afford to pay the Firefighters, we can afford decent aerial support. We can have more professional fulltimers like myself. We could have more part time payed. We could look at paying the volunteers. It just requires political will.

It just requires political will, but what do we get, I‚Äôll tell you what we get, Gladys says the resources are in hands. Scott says the volunteers love it. It's a vacuum of leadership. It's a vacuum of leadership. And with that look, where I take real heart is the fact that people like us , people like you are standing up and saying it‚Äôs not good enough. 

Now that's the immediate problem, the resourcing. But it's not enough to say that that's really where it ends from where I stand because Firefighters with these kind of fires, what we are is a band-aid. You can get a bigger Bandaid, you might even upgrade it to a bandage or a trauma wound bandage. But if the wound itself is infected, ultimately you've got a problem you can't fix. 

And that's the problem we got here because these conditions, the conditions that are giving us this fire season. They're the new normal. This is not a one off. This is what happens with a heating world. You start to see a change in climate, which means that Bush fires will get bigger and get worse. And that's why it's this government's shameful in action on climate change policy itself, which is the real horror show for me here today. 
Fire fighters are taught to minimize risk. That's one of the things we learned to do. 

Our workplace is inherently unsafe, so you work out ways to minimize risk. The problem with the fact that our government has failed to start moving on climate, it has failed to start de-carbonizing the economy is that this is the kind of risk I can't mitigate on the end of a fire hose. I can't mitigate by having more of my comrades alongside me. The only way that gets mitigated is by people like you keeping the pressure up so we actually see political action and start moving on de-carbonizing our economy.

I‚Äôm back to work tomorrow so I want to say this. It gives me enormous heart to see you all here today and it's going to give me heart tomorrow when I'm at work. This is a fight we have to win. This is a fight we can win all the best brothers and sisters and I'll see you at the next one. Thank you‚Äù.

I‚Äôm so glad they escaped !!
It's a joey taco salad.
Wow, veggie tales animation did not age well. But the Baby Kangaroo song is finally relevant!

*Everybody's got a baby kangaroo*

*Yours is pink but mine is blue*

*Hers was small but ......*

every time I see a post like this I can't help but wonder if the video is completely unrelated to the fires and someone's just using it for fake internet points
Funny how everyone is so distraught and caring about the kangaroos and koalas being burnt but couldn't give a flying fuck about the 10's of billions of land animals that are exploited and tortured annually. Oh don't forget animal agriculture is a leading cause of Global Warming and environmental destruction!
There is a video on r/gifs of adult kangaroos hanging out in a suburban neighborhood. Would there be any possible way to reunite the joeys and parent?
Is anyone saving the cane toads?
OMG they are so cute..glad they survived to repopulate the ones lost
Yea what about the 10000 camels Australians are killing because ‚Äúthey drink too much water‚Äù.
Just so everyone is aware.... a lot of the fires burning in Australia were deliberately lit. They have arrested over 20 people...... climate change is a contributing factor but I don‚Äôt like how much misinformation is being circulated. (I am Aussie and live down under)

Edit: my goodness. I can‚Äôt believe one comment can stir up so much hate (these comments are fine it‚Äôs more the messages) let me just say I do not deny the climate emergency we are currently facing. But it‚Äôs a known fact that most of these fires were started through arson.
aren‚Äôt kangaroos a pest in australia?
Go vegan for Australia
Why are all the instahoes all up in the Aussie fire thing
This is devastatingly sad.  These babies lost their families and yet assholes are still over there starting new fires and not a single one of those people have been executed for there crimes.....bravoüëè
Fuck kangaroos I hate those short armed deers
God bless üò≠üòç
If they have chemicals that can change the weather,, I mean they actually do in Moscow military parade they flew a plane over 2 stop it from raining. So why cant they do somet like that and make it rain. Not mental but this tech does exist...
ngl I would eat a baby kangaroo
Isn't it a bit weird to rescue/donate to help kangaroos when I can just go buy their meat in any supermarket here?
I work at a rescue centre but for koalas and some koalas that come in are just youngsters and the back is all burntüò¢üòìüò•üòìüò•ü•µüò•üò•üò•üò•ü•µü•µü•µüò•ü•µüò•ü•µü•µ
Don't just care for them when there's a fire, what about when there's no fire? Aussies cull Kangaroo numbers all the time, where were you then?
If you want to help combat the causes of these devastating fires then going vegan is the best thing you can do. No better time to make the change than the present, our planet needs you!
Aren't kangaroos like rats in Australia?
My man, you just melted the heart of a viking. Here's the poor man's gold. üèÖ

Edit: keep them safe
They will grow up to put dogs in headlocks and drown them.
Wait, so did their moms die. But weren‚Äôt they suppose to be in theirs mothers pouch? So shouldn‚Äôt they both had died if their mom died. This means their moms should still be a alive. Where are their moms.
