While helping take care of a rescue dove named Ms. Patootie, she wouldn't eat and had to be force fed for a few days. We put a video on of some other doves at a feeder and it immediately caught on via this socially distanced dinner date! I'm amazed this actually worked!

Edit: Front page?! Whaaaat! Y'all are silly. I'm still missing the last dove I cared for and set free, so it's been nice taking care of another little berb that needed an assist. Thanks for the Internet points! I'm at work, but will do my best to answer questions later this evening.
So, she is taking online classes?
The dove I rescued did everything he could to be babied as long as possible. He was SUCH a stinker. I miss the dude. He made it so hard to set him free. I would put him outside in a topless pen, and any time I stepped in there he would race over to one of my feet, lay down next to the arch of it and rest his head on my big toe.
So how did they teach them before smartphones? Did a guy rapidly bang his head into a a plate of food? Sorry I might be somewhat high.
Mirror neurons are responsible for this behavior, not all creatures have this ability....
What an ingenious and simple idea.  When I first saw it, I said, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù  Thank you for this.
YouTube tutorial for birds
[Everybody liked that.]
This is honestly super clever!

I volunteer at the Tucson Wildlife Center and what we typically have are "resident" animals that teach orphans how to feed and, in the case of predator species, hunt. 

This is a nice workaround for when you don't have anyone to set an example!
I love everything about this and I‚Äôm happy for you but please use a pop socket or a phone stand. I feel for you having to hold the phone the entire time
This warms my heart.
this is BRILLIANT
They do this to teach pandas how to have sex too. They literally show them panda porn
You‚Äôre so sweet and I love that you could share this moment, what a great victory for this lil guy.
This really hits the heart for me. Amazing work friend.. **thank you**.
I mean. Its cute. But I thought pigeons were the textbook example of TV being meaningless and slow to other animals?
 I love doves. They are my favorite birds at the feeder.
This is genius!! I just raised a rescued pigeon... Dear god I wish I had this idea üòì
Ohh thats smart. I used my fingers to "peck" the food to teach my bird. Haha seemed to work. Not dead.
This is brilliant I've learnt that when u put they're bird feeding sounds they start eating from a earlier stage in life
I had a cockatiel once that refused to eat and I used my fingers to peck the food while he stood there looking at me like an idiot, he would eat only when he was starving which wasn't a good thing.  I ended up giving him to a friend that had a bird house and the bird ended up dying a week later.  I wish I hadn't done that
Birds learning how to do bird stuff using YouTube is the most 2020 thing I've heard of
Man even doves are doing virtual learnings nowadays.
Sat my kitten in the litter box with a YouTube video on how to teach kittens to use the litter box. She picked up on it instantly.
birb watching youtube tutorials on how to eat seed. hahh
üéµwhen doves tryüéµ
Don‚Äôt put the phone up close to her, she might go blind!

/s
This is so wholesome
Aw my baby!! This is so precious ‚ù§
Beautiful thing you've done here ‚ù§Ô∏è
Awww. Is that a morning dove? They have the sweetest song.
It's called machine learning.
r/birdsarentreal
Just like in the simulations.
I was not prepared for how much I was going to love this.
This is amazing! Animals can learn remotely.... just like my son, who will be in a 'virtual' classroom in 2 weeks.
I'm reminded of that Gary Larson comic where ducks are walking along the street in "V" formation. They look up and see ducks flying overhead also in "V" formation and one of them says, "Hey! Look at what they're doing!"
#THAT IS ONE SMART DOVE
‚ÄúSchoOls musT b oPen oUr KidS caNt leARN rEMoTELy!‚Äù
Yooo what‚Äôs up my bird boils today imma show you how to eat this food!
These are doves? I see them in NYC all the time and thought they were a type of pigeon
Its videos like this that bring me back down to reality. Theres people out there, just like me and all of you, that actually give a fuck and actually care for things. We're nice people and would go out of our way to help someone/something else, even if it meant taking a loss while the other party only gained.  Thank you for...for just being you. Thank all of you
Young birds today are just glued to their phones, I swear.
I had no idea eating for pigeons was a learned behavior but here we are.
Is this considered Machine Learning ..................... ü§£
Wait it‚Äôs learning to eat from a youtube tutorial.
We officially have "How to" videos for pigeons. This is a crazy time.
That was brilliant! Keep up the work!
Awwe how cute! I have 3 cockatiels and its true that the younger ones each learn from the older ones just by watching what they do. They all learned to climb and sing this way.
I just imagine big screens in the jungle teaching lions how to hunt.
Aww bird mukbang ahaha
What an idea. Well done.
And people say technology is bad
doing god's work here, son.
Awwwwwwww so cuteeeeee
EDUCATION 100
You‚Äôre wonderful for helping her recoup and taking care of her. Thank you?
"Oh, so I just peck the food off the ground like some type of poor chicken?"


-Dove probably
My mom recently bought two parakeets and has been showing them bird porn
That is adorable
[deleted]
What did you do today?     

*Taught a dove how to eat by making it watch YouTube.*
Brilliant that is how they would learn from mom.
I watch Dr. Pol, apparently all birds aren‚Äôt born knowing how to peck stuff off the ground, they need to watch another bird. They use chicks, because chickens are born with that instinct.
No he just doesn't like eating alone
This is the future of rehabilitation!
I want to take Ms. Patootie on a social distance dinner date ;0;
In absence of parents, TV raised me too.
There really is a YouTube video for everything these days.
Whoever thought of doing that is a freaking GENUIS! I wish Ms. Patootie a speedy recovery.
I've been watching videos of a man who rescues everything, quails, common birds, squirrels, anything. One trick he learned hatching and feeding birds is to play adult bird songs, and they immediately jump to it and eat and break their eggs quicker than with his careful assistance
I‚Äôm half asleep and I read ostrich and got confused because the bird was too small
Be still my heart!! üò≠ Awww!!!
I needed this.  Wow I needed this.
Oh that‚Äôs the cutest saddest thing I‚Äôve seen today...
Smart little bird. Thank you for rescuing!
Mukbang for birds
Thank you to whoever took the time to recur the dove!
i wonder how effectively this is when teaching cats how to use the toilet and also using a device that trains them slowly. i bet it works way better.
Does it actually work?
That little cheeping noise they make is so cute.  I had a nest of mourning doves outside of my home office window and I would hear it every time the parents brought back food.
That was a good idea. When I was raising orphan birds we put them in an aquarium and tapped with a pencil outside the glass. The birds saw the pencil lead as a beak and imitated it by pecking and learned to eat on their own.
It's amazing how you can learn pretty much anything on YouTube.
The sweetest thing ever!
my dog loves the TV a little too much.   barks at dogs and attacks the tv, barks at weather people because of them moving their hands a lot.   barks at golf
That's actually really interesting. Did you know if a human baby is exposed to a second language through a TV they don't remember it but they do if the speaker is irl
If someone animates a Dove doing taxes, can they become an accountant after watching the video?
Even birds can lean how to do things by watching a tutorial on a smart phone
how to eat tutorial (WORKS 2020)
When I hatch chicks in the incubator you have to tap the food with your finger until one get it down that it‚Äôs good and you peck at it, then they will teach the others Same with water, need to dip the beak of one bird then the others will follow when it starts to drink.
When you‚Äôre doing online school and it‚Äôs lunch
I would so hug you and Ms. Patootie...aww-this makes my heart happyüíúü§òüèª‚≠êÔ∏èü§òüèªüíú
This is the same tactic zookeepers used with pandas who didn‚Äôt know how to mate. 

Except with porn.
Good work, good idea! Former wildlife rehabber here. I spent some time every year holding a hand at bird body height and tap tap tapping one finger on the food and dabbling in a shallow water dish. Little doves and pigeons can be a bit knuckle headed about it all but they do catch on.
Oh my goodness - so clever and so adorable! So glad she was able to figure it out üòä
this is what it sounds like when doves cry
On-line classes on "How to Bird."  Nice.
I had the same issue yet the only problem was that the dove that I found (I live at the west coast of the US) was from Mexico, I do have relatives there yet the bird looked lost and had no where to go, so I bought a bird feeder and water and was able to catch the little guy, I started taking care of the little fella in a bird cage. I wanted it to go back where it originally came from yet hearing how bad it was over there, I decided to take care of the little guy until where over with the pandemic.
SMH millenial birds needs fucking youtube to learn how to eat...
Can we show her some birds pooping in a water closet ?
Brilliant
I would die for Ms. Patootie ü•∫ü•∫ <3
What are you trying to do make a grown man cry? ‚ù§Ô∏è
This makes my heart hurt. What a lonely existence for a little bird.
Smart thing to do
pek pek pek, ok whats next? oh yeah, pek pek eh.... yeah pek pek pek pek...ahh fuck I missed a bit....can you rewind it I missed the part about the pek pek at around 12 seconds, sorry I'm still learning.
AWWWWW
That's so sweet and so sad at the same time.
Amazing! Very good idea!
i'm going to cryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy omg
Aww it‚Äôs nice to see social distancing works
Woah!
Lol. Interesting ü§î
Can someone tell me the intricacies of how a bird can see the screen?
ü§éü§éü§é
Just like the force fed dove

Burps a lot

Sounds like she's singing

Cooooo, baby. Cooooo. Said coooooo.
Don't mind if I save it
It is the new normal
Hope she didn‚Äôt lose her mate or had one, if so I hope she can find her mate again once she‚Äôs released.
birb is like, 'oh, this is nice, I like this'
What a brilliant idea.
This is AGGRESSIVELY cute
Animal Adaptation of Me watching the Food Ranger eat stuff around the world!
Someone give an award I‚Äôm to poor :( this is precious
Damn everyones doing distance learning this fall
My wife rescued a mourning dove chick and raised him up on watered down dog food in a syringe. She cut the top off the syringe and put the finger of a rubber glove over it and put a small hole in it was more natural for him.

On a side note he has grown up now and absolutely loves me to the point that he attacks her if she gets to close to me when he is out of his cage.
This is the first time I've been exposed to the idea that birds don't just go to food and water and eat it on their own. This is really surprising, but fascinating.
Pretty cool.
This is cool
That is excellent!!!
Interesting.
That‚Äôs a really clever way to teach it. Did you find in on your own, or were you guided by a professional ?
Dude, nice.
Mukbang for birds
Now you can use this video to teach other doves on how to teach other doves on how to learn how to eat. Great.
"*That's how I had to learn sex.  Now my beak hurts!*"

Big Bird
Genius.
Aw
We do truly live in an incredible time
Omg that's so cute. Good on ya!
Clever!
"wait I put the food in my mouth and swallow it?"
Really nice idea. F.
I want someone to rescue me and show me how to do stuff
You mean to tell me, that spiders can just build a complex as fuck web to then catch, roll up, preserve and devour their food without ever being taught.
And this damn pigeon can‚Äôt even eat some corn without being taught?
would one of those bobbing birds that drink water on the office table do the same?
‚ÄúCoo coo, am I coming through OK? Can you guys hear me? I‚Äôm not on mute am I?‚Äú
You should look up a local homing pigeon group and see if they can take him or sell you a friend/mate. Pigeons and doves are very social animals.
This is awesomely kind and ingenuious of you
I really like this. It reminds me of a cat I used to have, who was special needs and got well into adulthood without really knowing how to play. Me and my then girlfriend moved into a place that had another cat, one who was an experienced hunter and player. My cat would sit and watch the other one play, and eventually started to play too. We got to watch her learn to play for the first time as an adult. It was the most adorable thing I've ever seen. After that she would play like any cat, and she loved those cheap colorful toy mice. Thanks for reminding me of it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
This bird is like, ‚Äúwhy tf does he keep shoving this in my food everytime I try to eat!?‚Äù
üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Shoulda kept gavaging that mofo and tried some Dove foie Gras!
The cute killed me.
Monkey see, monkey do- it's a real thing, and for more than just monkeys.
I wonder if it helps with humans/children that have problems with various things to watch videos to learn a certain behaviour
The real question is, can that dove see the images on the screen? It all depends on how fast they can process the frame rate and resolution right?
drone*
Or it wants to eat because others are around
I love how this sub actually makes me say ‚Äúaww‚Äù
MY HEART
something feels off do doves even see the same way humans do i know many animals can't even tell what is happening on screens.....
Now that‚Äôs using your noodle
Cute, I told my friend to do this to teach his bulldog how to skateboard.
That's just a fancy pigeon!
Now show the bird a safecracking video....
It‚Äôs like me watching a podcast or a livestream while eating with them.
Mourning doves to be exact!
I love technology.
I read it as rescued love at first ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I k ew YouTube was good for something.
Now he's addicted to YouTube
Awesome!!üòª
This is why I think life is a simulation,  maybe we are like that dove and the creators are just showing us a fake reality
Haha this reminds me of myself scratching a cat post like a giant cat mom to teach my kitten, my mom thought it was hilarious!
Technology rules!! Everytime i see a phone do something amazing i think back to my elementary school teacher telling me I wont be walking around with a calculator all the time when I questioned why I needed to learn multiplication tables.
dove mukbang
My heart!
This could not be more wholesale. 
Cheers
Oh my heart!
Aww I want to rescue a dove how do I create a situation where a dove needs rescuing
Pigeon muk bang
Good thing you didn‚Äôt show it a video of lions killing and eating a deer.
Wish I could teach my son like this!
And now he has buddies to eat with!  


I'm totally not going to put monitors on my table with people eating so I don't feel like I'm eating alone now
This is interesting because in humans (and other species) we have mirror neurons. It would appear here that birds have the same neural mechanism.
I want to cry this looks so sad. He looks so lonely
This is so amazing that this worked. So cool ü•∞
At this age i think they start learning how to eat by themselves.
That's kind of like panda porn teaching through video .
She's a visual learner.
Injured surveillance drone required firmware reset via ocular interface.
That's pretty much how I learned to reproduce, so
Awww that's cute
Brilliant!
the perfect example of what great the internet can do!!

# IT'S BIG BRAIN TIME
Thats awesome !!
Genius
why am I crying
I wanna see Godzilla eating now...
my mom taught me never to sit that close to the screen
Brilliant
Even the birds cannot have in person classes and have to participate digitally now...
Please name him Archamedies
Doves don't experience persistence of vision at as low a frame-rate as humans, so where we see a video,  she sees a slideshow.

The chicken in Moana needs this video...
Through the power of science!
''Eating food? Amazing! Why didn't I think of that?''

-Some Dove
This is how close I sit to my monitor too.
Cluckbang
You either don't know what to say
I also learn things from YouTube
What are you supposed to feed birds?
You kids and your smartphones!
Back in my day, we'd call the dove "dinner" and be done with it!

*Technology*
We are gods on this planet
Thanks for getting him ready for September 1st.
I just ‚Äúpeck‚Äù the seed with my finger in front of babies :)
technology ü§ç
It didn't know how to eat?
that‚Äôs lovely
Those Indian Dove video tutorials are definitely life savers
ü•∫
That is smart thinking dude
From the young age ppl told me to not touch pigeons because they are like flying rats that can have many diseases, are you not afraid? Or it's not really that dangerous? I still avoid them
Excellent job !! Well done friend god bless!!
smrt
WOW, just WOW!!
Nice
Great idea!
Omg üò≠
You can learn anything on YouTube nowadays.
I love mourning doves. They don‚Äôt really seem to play with a full deck but it makes them endearing.
I hope you go to Heaven for this bro
This is just so wholesome. 

It's wonderful to know that us humans have created videos that not only help us but helps other animals when they need it.
Awww
What a great idea. It demonstrates how social the birds are.
You are a good person.
Reminds me of the time i learned a dog to sniff
Is there a copy of the video available anywhere online? as I am in the process of nursing a baby dove and this absolutely blew my mind!
That's really smart
The power of the internet is immense
This is what internet is for!!!!
next up: dove learns to deliver drugs from deepfake video with other doves :))
Just didn‚Äôt want to eat alone.
Can we talk about how realistic images have become that animals think it is 3D but not?
_*TECHNOLOGY*_
Um baby dove
and boomers say technology is bad
Im not sure if pigeons can actually see the image on LCD screen sooo.....
Wow. So amazing! I wonder how the dove ate before being rescued? These dumb animals wouldn't know what to do if it wasn't for us Humans, the greatest thing to ever happen to this planet!
How can an animal not know how to eat?
I Really doubt that it learns by seeing, eating is instinctive in all animals.
It's more likely that it was scared to eat because a human is around, or it already ate to its full a d humans come and stuff it some more.
Remedial bird 101.  How dumb can an organism be?
Even doves can learn from online classes, but our children can't...
