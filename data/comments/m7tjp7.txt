I thought my dog would be so happy to see his first butterfly and I pictured this sort of interaction...

But nope my jackass jack russel decided he'd rather put it in his mouth, then I guess the fluttering upset him so he spit it out and started stomping on it until it stopped moving and THEN he ate it.
Those Disney movies keep on getting more realistic!
This was magical.
Thank you OP for this magical moment.
Super cute!  Butterfly must have a suicide wish tho..
If I ever get Alzheimer's, just put this on for me all day and I'll die happy
False: that butterfly is playing with a puppy :)

This must be a trailer for what heaven looks like.
My rational mind is having a hard time believing this is real, but it seems butterflies like puppy breath just as much as humans!
That's not a butterfly it's obviously a pupperfly, which is why it won't leave him alone.
Me if I reincarnated into a butterfly.
I don’t care if this is real or not.  Having a not so great day today and I really needed this.
I was so worried he was gonna eat the little guy. Cute as heck!

Butterfly playing with a puppy
This started cute but then it turned into harassment. The puppy literally ran inside to get away.
Almost seems cgi.. the way the butterfly hovers exactly as the dogs head rotates.
I need to know where such magical things happen. What language are they speaking?

As cute as this is, I'm a little terrified of butterflies now after reading other comments about how aggressively they'll try to drink from eyeballs.  
This post has been a rollercoaster of emotions for me.
It is the butterfly playing with the pupper?
Is it me or does the butterfly look CGI?
cheese and crepes this cant be real. ITS TOO DAMN CUTE HOW
Adorable. I was cringing a bit the whole time though, thinking "please don't eat it".

You would think the butterfly would GTFO! Why be near something that's swatting at you? Unless they really are *both* playing!
It may seem cute at First glance but when you take a deeper look you see the puppy, trying to eat the butterfly and the butterfly, laughing it’s ass off because the puppy can’t eat it

That's one of the cutest things I've ever seen.
My parents had a cat whose favorite activity was harrassing barn swallows.

This fatass wouldn't hunt birds. He would poke his head into the horse stall where the swallows nested, then run about 20ft out into the pasture and lay on his back while they dive bombed him.
It should be titled, “Puppy attacked by butterfly.”

Sorry to be a Debbie Downer, but this video is totally fake.  Butterflies just don't have the ability to move like this, especially in the way it flies down to land near the end of the video.

So gentle with the butterfly! Dogs are such a gift.
Butterfly definitely looks very animated.
Now this, this is the purest video in the universe.
CGI
Here’s my theory. The original video has a fly buzzing around the dog. A talented individual added the butterfly over it for cuteness factor and internet points. That’s why the dog interacts so closely with it.
Tons of people looking at this and believe what they see, but to me it looks fake? Why don't people see it looks cgi?
The butterfly looks really fake
Get this fake bullshit outta here
This is clearly CGI
This is cute, but it's pretty obvious (if you know what to look for) that it also isn't real. The toy he's actually playing with has been removed digitally and replaced with the butterfly. I suspect its someone in a green suit, as it's clear at moments that the puppy is pulling on a toy with some resistance. 

It's well done though, so props to whomever put the work into making this. :)
OK, now I'm convinced people in this sub are just using CGI for reddit points.
It looks fake
I think it’s fake and I’ll accept my downvotes. Cute nonetheless.

Update: on rewatch, in the very last moment the butterfly flies over the tile of the doorstop and you see it’s shadow and brief reflection. So now I’m on the side of real, orrrr very good CGI.
Notice how every time the butterfly "lands" on the dog it is suspended a solid inch off of it? Its very clearly a CGI animation
This might be a dumb question, but why was the butterfly doing this? Did it not sense the danger? What benefit does landing on a swatting biting (playfully, but still!) dog bring to the butterfly? Surely a butterfly cannot have the mental capacity to play? Or am I underestimating their brains?
its all fun and games till the dog eats the butterfly
Clearly fake and there seems to be a group in the comments intent on misinformation. I keep seeing these bad cgi videos being posted with comment sections where the truth is down voted and a ton of gaslighting to insist it's real. Almost like an experiment on deep-fakes and manipulation. "Don't believe what you clearly see and know is fake"

You can fake a lot of things on the internet, but this isn't one of them.
That butterfly was playing with a puppy.
The butterfly is most likely after the salts in the tear ducts of the puppy's eyes.   It's common to see moths and butterflies do this in the wild with larger animals such as buffalo and cattle and crocodiles/alligators.
This just in! 

Video of adorable puppy playing with butterfly goes viral and cures every disease known to man by simply watching it.

Little do we know, this venomous butterfly was stinging the puppy who excruciatingly died minutes later from suffocation. The butterfly laid eggs in the flesh and when the eggs hatched the caterpillars ate the carcass to the bone. Isn’t Mother Nature beautiful?
This is cute as hell, but if this is your dog, please remember to chase the butterfly away next time. It looks like it was a monarch, which are poisonous if eaten - if he managed to catch and eat it he’d be vomiting & having heart problems, and that’s one quick trip to the vet :’(

This reminds me of when I had first adopted my crazy pup from the Humane Society. He was a tiny terror, honestly. Just wild. Well, we were outside my apartment and I saw the most beautiful butterfly I've literally ever seen. It was a combination of pink/purple/yellow. I had never seen anything like it before or since. 

Soon Dog noticed it too and watched it with curiosity. It was nice to see him finally calm, and it was a really great moment.

Then he proceeded to eat it.

The butterfly really wants to drink that pup’s tears bad
My dog would try to eat it.
That’s one brave butterfly
How can that butterfly fly with balls of steel
Yes I read all the reviews/comments, it’s all quite relevant. But I don’t think the puppy is playing with the butterfly I think the butterfly is playing with the puppy. Maybe for tears may be for poo, or just may be for fun think about it how fun would it be to F with something that much bigger than you? Ha ha wouldn’t you feel proud of yourself!? Anyway I think the pup had a good time as did the butterfly. CJR
This is beautiful
Pretty sure this is a butterfly playing with a puppy, hes doing literal circles around the smoll pup
_monch_
Scientific proof right here bugs have feelings. Halt all tests and research.
those vicious attack butterflies...
The butterfly is secretly attacking the pupper
Dude you’re a background character. It’s obvious that he’s the main character of a movie
I think this is the cutest thing since Keanu's puppy video.
Dog & Butterfly
I think you mean trying to eat lol

Omg cue the Disney movie

No, you fool! That's not a butterfly, that's a ***Blooder***fly! It'll drain that puppy of it's blood in seconds!
The title should be "Butterfly playing with a puppy"
I'm blown away by the amount of people on here that think this is real. Is this April fool's day?
You must be a Disney princess if animals are doing this kind of shit around you
Disney, is that you?
My emotions are all over the place, I keep going back and forth between aww and This is not going to end well for the butterfly
That's really cute.  Let us hope that the little pupper does not goosh the butterfly though! :)

Owner's previous pup came back as a butterfly to play with the new kid...good karma there.
You mean, a butterfly playing with a puppy!
Even though butterflies disgust me, this is still adorable.
This looks more like "Butterfly playing with a puppy"
I'm glad I saw this first thing today.
Playing?? More like getting attacked! poor puppy probably has a butterfly phobia! 😂
More like the butterfly is playing with the puppy.
Thought I was gonna see the butterfly pick the puppy up and fly away.
Why is the butterfly attracted to the puppy? Never seen anything like it.
Rad shiiitttt
Or a butterfly playing with a puppy!
At first I was like, "Ohh, so cute!" and then it became, "Oh crap..that butterfly is belligerent!"
My heart 🥺🥰
If it was my puppy, the butterfly's already inside my puppy's stomach. My puppy eats first and spits out if he does not like the taste.
That the cutest fucking thing ever!

"The way I had it figured, Puppuk's the baddest pup in the field. Nothing attacks him. So why would he ever look up? That was just a theory." - Butterflyvatar
Mothra certainly makes more sense as a nuisance/threat to larger kaiju now.
This is some Disney shit right here
This is just what I needed to see today!
So butterflies like puppy breath also
The world for once, In perfect harmony.
I don't care what anyone says. The butterfly is clearly playing with the puppy and not trying to drink his eye juice.
That butterfly's living on the edge.
I needed to see that

That's bordering on harassment, butterfly!

What in the Disney movie was that?
Puppy getting his ass kicked by butterfly. Get that butterfly a fighting contract.
This is so pure!!!

That butterfly must have been a doggo in a past life
Waiting till the puppy eats it. I seen so many of these videos where the dog ends up just chopping it down. 😢
It’s a Disney movie.
Title should be butterfly playing with puppy !!
Are you fucking kidding me. This video just cured my depression
Thats different
Little did Pup know, his friend the butterfly died later that day due to old age. Everyday Pup looks out the window hoping his friend will visit him again. Hope turns to sadness which eventually turned into resentment for the butterfly. For Pup now believed he was abandoned by his old friend.

 If only he knew the lifespan of butterflies. Smh
2 things. 

1. Watching this was lovely
2. The butterfly needs knocking out
This is adorable. More please
I think that butterfly is playing with that puppy.

Your dog is my favorite Disney Princess
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in a while... thanks!!!!
It's trying to drink puppy tears so it can have more sex. Nature.
So is the butterfly playing or viciously attacking the pup 🤔
