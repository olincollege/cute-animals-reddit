This is my favourite thing. He was so determined. He got me at the ball pit. And then i thought he'd been trapped at the end after all his hard work. So many emotional twists and turns!
Haha, I love it. Here's the [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2xgiHVjT7o) for anybody wondering. Better quality as well.
Let's be honest. None of us would make it that far
I think there were a few moments of eye contact with the person recording it and swear I heard the little dude say "seriously?! You had to have this? Just let me out man." üòÇüòÇ
Dood the trapdoor scared me not gonna lie
The fudging cgi smoke had me cracking up
That was adorable... I was a bit concerned when the cage trapped him, but he‚Äôs a determined little guy
Which crimes did he committed initially to get in jail?
What delightful way to spend my morning poop!

I did scream when he fell into the ball pit though.
Why is this on r/aww? A dangerous convict just escaped the prison!
Thank you for making a crappy day a little bit brighter!
I get the feeling that you an GLaDOS would get along pretty well.
**First several seconds**: "Awww, that's cute and kinda cool at the same time."

**26 seconds in when I see the steam pipe special effect**: "Oh dang, it's gonna be like THAT!" *Mission Impossible theme song plays in my mind*
The water trap caught me off-guard. I was drinking my coffee and choked a bit when I saw him fall into it. I had to explain to my coworkers what I saw.
I'd watch this over American Ninja Warrior any day of the week.
Shawshank Redemption
So unrealistic. 
Not a single poop drop anywhere.
I grew up with satellite TV, and I've completed netflix and prime. I can honestly say, this is the best thing I've ever seen!
Aww at first it was cute, but when he was trying to look over the walls on his little hind legs, I felt bad for him. However, at least he‚Äôs getting stimulation and not just sitting in a lonesome cage all day.
Go little guy, go
The sfx are the best part
That whole thing was actually built very well! The one time where he actually got stuck he could break the cage, but everywhere else it held together perfectly.
not sure if hamster more impressive or the fact you took the time to build this for the hamster
That little guy is such a smarty pants!
I loved this! Filming, sound effects, and tension buildup were amazing!
However, I'm a bit concerned about the waste management system dumping excrements to a random room downstairs
My rats would just have gone "Meh, I'll take a nap first, then I'll just climb over the walls...".
This is totally awesome, but way too short. Needs another 6 or 7 dozen hours.
What's the source? This is great.
Poor little guy must be tired after all that!
What a weird sewage system.
Video ends before he reaches Zihuatanejo.
This is working out the little fella‚Äôs brain so much! Such an enriching activity. It does my heart proud.
Proper recycling of a fidget spinner! Nice!

So this is how El Chappo did I it....
Ngl that was intense. Here have my upvote.
Some people just drink and watch Netflix during lockdown.

And others....well...
Thanks for such a Motivational Video   
Both Owner and pet has spent some bigtime in creating it   
it too beautiful and creative : )
Lol, I thought that was a real toilet and spend the first few seconds trying to figure out what kind of dog it was.
I'm *y e l l i n g* and i haven't stopped in 4 minutes and 32 seconds 

But isn't that a bit stressful for the hamster? I just now that *rabbits* can spontaneously drop dead if they get scared. Not sure about hamsters.

Edit: thank you for all the replies! I thought it looked fun, but I never had a hamster so I wasn't sure if they would perceive all the moving parts as real threats. It's good to know he was probably having fun too.
What offence was the hamster incarcerated for?
I like how he kept checking for other pathways other then the obvious one forward.
I don't even want to know how much time was spent on that, but I'm quite sure that little guy gets more than enough entertainment and exercise.
Haha this is so cute !!!
Hmmmm...

It took me a while to confirm but I think those hazards are not real. Not sure about that lava pit, though.
Every time I saw him look up I felt like he was saying you son of a bitch lol
by the time it got to the blue revolving door (fidget spinner) I can tell it has had enough.
That was an awesome way to start my day. If this little guy can break out of prison, I can too! Thanks for the motivation lil man
That might be only 4¬Ω minutes to a human, but that was like 5 years to Hammy

El Chapo???
Imagine what‚Äôs going through it‚Äôs mind

‚ÄúI gotta get outtta here‚Äù
He smort
I would watch this YouTube channel
Who‚Äôs heart dropped when he fell in the ball pit?
I wonder if the hamster was having fun or just like "Damn it Jerry not again with your shit!"
Didnt expect it to be such a long video haha! Awesome it did keep going on, nifty! Glad it got a snack at the end.
It was sad when he came out and his freedom was just a facade
Looks great!
How about a Ninja Warrior run?
WHAT DID HE DO TO GET IN
Can we please make Total Hamster Wipeout a thing
Yo look it's El Chapo
You are a hamster everyday my little friend. However, today, you are more. Today, you are a hamSTAR
I recently got pet rats and I definitely wanna make things like this for them as well
What a silly hamster ... youre supposed to keep running after escaping jail not have a picnic! @_@
Imagine being that hamster. That must be fun af
Hope he gets a year long vacation for this traumatic experience
i love how the hamster seems to get increasingly frustrated at the new absurd challenges. they keep looking at the camera like "bro what the fuck is all this shit i didnt even do anything."
I know what every one is thinking no the lava isn't real... Untill you touch it
This stressed me out, like...a LOT. 2020 has taken a toll on my nerves.
i was expecting him ending up in the cell again
This is one of the best things I‚Äôve seen!
‚ÄúAndy Dufrein, a man who crawled through a river of obstacle course and puzzles, came out hungry on the other side‚Äù
So, how have you spent your time during lockdown?
I watched the whole thing

Bad Morgan Freeman voice: ‚ÄúIt truly was a Shawshank Redemption.‚Äù
This is adorable, and I couldn't help but think, people have too much time on their hands, but then I realized, I just spent over 4 minutes watching a hamster escape.
I was so emotionally invested in it, and gasped in shock when the little guy fell into the pit and then got caught in the cage.
‚ÄúAll units, we‚Äôve got a smol jailbreak at Sector B. I repeat, Sector B jailbreak. Respond immediately, over.


Smol Patrol hazard teams, use anti-adorableness prevention suits to apprehend the smol perpetrators, this is a big fish. Correction, hamster. Over.‚Äù
What a fantastic enrichment activity for that little guy/gal!! My mice would LOVE this, but they're hardcore cheaters and would for sure jump those walls.
I totally need a part 2
It's like a Super Mario castle!
Everything was cute until the owner it took fsr by having the hamster walk over actual lava. Some people will do anything for views, no matter the amount of hamsters they burn along the way...
I finally found out the purpose of fidget spinners.
My question is, what did they do to be put in maximum security hamster prison
Shawshank Rodent-tion
Probably took forever to put together.
What did the hamster do to deserve going to jail
Oh man is this how our Alien Overlords (They would obviously be giant humanoid hamsters) would treat us? A massive obstacle course to fascinate / amuse themselves.
Is that hamster not stressed out af?
I started to feel stressed out on the hamster's behalf
I would have needed jolly cooperation
I had the mission impossible music going on in my head.
I enjoyed it all the way through without sound on then realise there is sound and it's even better!

This really should be posted on r/nextfuckinglevel too
this made my day. thank you.
Hands down, the best thing I'll see on the internet today. 

I hope this is your original work.
Security needs work, great video!
Basically what the Shawshank Redemption is about
Fluffy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of shit  and came out clean on the other side.
i would love to see him doing it again and again. to see progress. maybe a speedrun?
The whole time I was expecting it to end back in the prison cell with the toilet back in place.
Lava is not safe for ham hams!
I have never loved something as much as I have loved this. And I want to escape this prison myself. Does anyone have a human to hamster converter handy?
Kept looking at the time when the cage came down, thinking it can't end like this...
I'm so glad he got his treat
Go hammy go!!! Be free!!!
Cute little mouse doesn't even understand that he's in an obstacle course üòÇ
Good run, looks like it only lost one live at 3:08
I can‚Äôt believe we are upvoting people making their pets walk over lava traps.  Shame on all of you!
The steam puffs got me üòÇ
Oh man I was so invested and cheering him on at parts. Clever little guy and great stimulation!

You're ab awesome hamster owner. That looks like a lot of fun. You should try game design, bc that level was really cool.

What is this, a prison for guinea pigs?!?
I was legit cheering him on when he had to chew his way out of the last trap.
You had me at the steam edited in! This hamster lives a life of luxury!üòÅ
Plot twist: he is still in the matrix

what the hell kind of prison is this?
Super cute. Also, this person has way too much time on their hands. #HAMSTERFUGITIVEGOFUNDME
It truly was a Shawshank redemption.
Best 4 minutes and 32 seconds of my life. And also, that's one hell of a prison.
"What did you do during the pandemic?"  
OP: "Funny you should ask..."
In 1966, Andy Dufresne escaped from Shawshank prison. All they found of him was a muddy set of prison clothes, a bar of soap, and an old rock hammer, damn near worn down to the nub. I used to think it would take six-hundred years to tunnel under the wall with it. Old Andy did it in less than twenty. Oh, Andy loved Geology, I guess it appealed to his meticulous nature. An ice age here, million years of mountain building there. Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes really, pressure, and time. That, and a big god-damned poster. Like I said, in prison a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied. It turns out Andy's favourite hobby was totin' his wall through the exercise yard, a handful at a time. I guess after Tommy was killed, he decided he had been here just about long enough. Andy did like he was told, buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine. The guard simply didn't notice, neither did I... I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a mans shoes? Andy crawled to freedom through five-hundred yards of shit smelling foulness I can't even imagine, or maybe I just don't want too. Five-Hundred yards... that's the length of five football fields, just shy of half a mile.

God how I love those hamster obstacles videos
Is he really making those squeaks?
Yo, just saw hamst vent
Emotional rollercoaster
This hamster has a way more interesting life than me now.
‚ÄúSo what did you do during quarantine?‚Äù
Might be the happiest hamster in the world. 10/10 environmental engagement!
This was more epic than the stunt school video from yesterday.
4:32? I‚Äôm not watching that, it‚Äôs too long.

Proceeds to watch the entire thing on the edge of my seat.
This is what internet is for.
What was he in prison for?
What‚Äôs your choice Mr. Bond? Battle the treacherous lava pit or be stuck at the ping pong ball meadows for eternity?!
u/SaveVideo
Everything about this video is impressive. From the setup to the determination of this little guy, everything was just great.
Awesome! Nicely mad and fun üëå
I mean really, how often do you look at a hamster‚Äôs shoes?
*he is a man focus...commitment... and sheer fucking will*
This is pretty much how I go through life everyday except the obstacles are more like filthy customers getting mad at me.
Just needed some Shawshank redemption music at the finale to be perfect.
Is no one else concerned that the toilet seems to just empty into a random room beneath the cell??

What kind of prison is this??
I was hoping for a weighted companion cube.
Wow some people have alot of time on their hands
When he fell on the trap door I thought he was done for
The ball pitt was the funniest thing ever. Look at his feetsies flail.
Do hamsters know how ridiculous they look?
These hamster obstacle courses are truly giving me life
How long did this take to make. Thanks for making my day ü•∫
I was rooting for him all the way.
"so what did you do during quarantine?"
That was so satisfying to watch, well done! Loved it.
This hamster must be so fucking stressed out
The person who made this can be a movie director.
Aww this is just so adorable
Is this prison break or are they just testing the newest course design for the next season of Wipeout!
What kind of prison has lava flowing through it?

Great job man!!!
There are a concerning number of OSHA violations in this prison. Somebody should mention this to the warden in their report. Sure, escaping convicts is a bad thing. But injuries while escaping lead to lawsuits.
This totally belongs on r/nextfuckinglevel lol
That‚Äôs 4 minutes and 32 seconds of my life I‚Äôll never get back. Worth it.
I like that he stopped to warm up his belly over the lava pit.
Why did I just watch that whole thing?
The fucking trap door. Holy shit I laughed so hard
15/10 sound effects. Adorable.
This is the stuff movies should be made. Shawn Connery voice in the back ground.
What a rollercoaster!  Phew.

p.s. I am a regular diyer and for any project I usually need to make 3 trips to Home Depot about an hour away and then 2 trips to Ace Hardware in town. The amount of thought and preparation that went into this project is nothing short of mind boggling.  Mad respect for the person who put this all together.  Three hurrays for the hamster.
Utterly epic.
This is so messed up... forcing a hamster to walk over lava and through dangerous steam and even an actualy monster... for our amusement?
Much higher quality version:

Silver for the little one.
My boyfriend showed my hamster hell the other day and I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it while watching this
GUYS WTF?! YOU'RE SUPPORTING THIS CRIMINAL?!
why did I feel such a sense of danger when the hamster was over the lava...
Quarantines been kinda rough for you huh bro? üòÇ this was really well done for real
At some point the prison became a Super Mario 64 level.
That hamster is smarter than my dog
I see we‚Äôre all dealing with COVID in our own way
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED???
I did the same thing. Can I have F for hamsters who didn't made it.
The only thing I really want to know is how long this took to build. Incredible ingenuity, and someone who understands hamsters very well.

What was that cage at the end made out of?
This reminded me of the end of Truman Show when everyone around the world is cheering on Truman

Also it seemed a bit unnecessarily dangerous to me

At least he made it past the lava lake alright
Positive that the hamster had more fun than the creator
Hamster did like he was told. Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine. The guard simply didn't notice,  neither did I. I mean, seriously how often do you really look at a man's shoes.

Hamster crawled to freedom through 500 yards of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine. Or maybe I just don't want to. 500 yards, that's the length of 5 football fields, just shy of half a mile.
This was more exciting than American Ninja Warrior

The amount of times he looked up like ‚Äúis this over yet?‚Äù Was hilarious
This video is so cute! My 2-year-old nephew will not sit still even for five seconds! He watched this whole thing like it was a suspense movie! He laughed at the hamster when it fell through the trap door and üêπ at the end, he cheered ‚ÄúWOO HOO‚Äù when the lil guy/gal got to the finish line or busted outta prison! Thanks to whoever made this! üòÑ

I would like to thank the company that laid you off to bring us one of the few highlights of 2020!
I've never rooted for something more in life! I wish I had his determination for just going into the kitchen for a drink.
I like how with several of the obstacles he looks at the cameraman like "you serious?"
Best 4 minutes and 32 seconds of my life. And also, that's one hell of a prison.
Great job, Little Guy! This was my favorite video of the day.

I was on the edge of my seat the whole time.
Dang that took so work to create.  Wow!  I'm impressed.   Thanks for sharing

i just want to know if that little hamster can read those arrows. GREAT VIDEO!!!!
I legitimately enjoyed this so much more than the entirety of the Sequel Trilogy. Well done!!
Looks like and episode of American Ninja Warriors or Titan games.....
This is legit better than Shawshank.
Those little legs flipping up at 1:42 ü§ó
I was truly on edge at the end, good job lil hammy
Just commenting to save the video, in case a 5 minute commercial comes up on Youtube, plus it's pretty cool.
Smart little  thing!
And all for some sunflower seeds
Wow that was an emotional rollercoaster. I cheered out load at some points. What a little champion
I heard the second season isn't as good
Today I learned how to curse in hamster. Thanks for that.
Andy Dufresne crawled through ten miles of shit
It feels like watching one of those weird Japanese game shows.
This is badass, but seeing the hamster go in the tube reminds me of the memes of hamster getting blown out of pipes like paper balls from straws
This is not ‚Äúaww‚Äù, imagine how tortured it must feel
Awwwwwheessslittlleeefacceee
Loved all the immersive sound. I was 100% rooting for the hamster/chinchilla
This is amazing
Now this is what I call a proper jailbreak
Thought he was gonna get caught at the ping pong balls. WHERE ARE THE GUARDS?!?!?
I was rooting the whole time
The look after the trap door kills me.

"Really? You put that in? Screw you!"
This is the real footage of Prison break new season.
This was riveting
The Return of Hamtaro !
What an emotional roller coaster.
I had a little one like that. No idea what goes through their mind all day. He would rather take the leap and jump from my hands than actually wait until I put him down again. He had one of those things you can put in your living room so they have more space (like a little fence) and all he did was looking at ways to escape in a very hyper way. He never bit me and he was quite chill. He loved to run in a rat and in one of those balls. But wtf is going through their mind all day

I think the lava pit was a bit too much
I didn't see this anywhere in the comments, and I'm sure it'll probably be buried, but I'm curious if the fake predator is harmful for them at all?

I don't know much about hamsters, but, if I remember right, rabbits have a pretty weak heart and can be scared into a heart attack.

Besides that, I think this is an absolutely wonderful video! Obviously the fake predator didn't do any harm because the hamster is fine, but I don't know if there's a process to get them acclimated to that. It's obviously wasn't that hamsters first rodeo.

These elaborate hamster videos are stronger arguments for simulation theory than I ever would‚Äôve imagined. 

Also, every the the hamster looks up at the camera person, I can just imagine those moments being when the human in the same scenario prays to their god for help. 

Am I taking all this too seriously?
I‚Äôm not impressed with the hamsters skill but I‚Äôm glad someone spent this much time to amuse the guy. Most hamsters just get a running wheel.
This was brilliant. Loved the little details in the maze, like the stickers and hazard warnings. And did anyone else audibly gasp at the trapdoor?!
Every second of this was awesome
This was amazing!  So creative.  Thank you for sharing!
This is so sweet!! Wish I had a little hamster now
My hamster would have just climbed out the top and ignored it all. I'm surprised by how willing this one is to actually do what the human wants!
I didn't want it to end.

I‚Äôd like to think every prison has an obstacle course if you try to break out.
My daughter LOVES watching these types of videos before bed. We'll hangout just before bed, she'll snuggle up against me, then asking to watch "hamster videos". The tall colorful "building" ones are her favorite.



Me, on the other hand, is tired of watching hamster videos
Is that a hamster ?
Sleep deprived me said to myself "that's a smart rabbit" then I realized its crawling and just doing it's thing

This is why KSI's hamster will win the race
This is amazing
Best action movie of the year , alot of imagination and suspens
Was watching this with genuine intrigue, you should make some more of these
This is the greatest thing I‚Äôve seen all year
Does it get scared by the plastic scorpion?
Well I‚Äôm stuck time to wash my face
I wanted to hear him scream FREEDOM!  Seriously we need a sequel. Where does he go from here?
MISSON IMPOSIBLE
Shawshank Redemption
Omg I love him and I love this.
The cake is a lie
...why he chose enchilada night, I'll never know.
This is one of the best things I've seen all year.
Aha, got him with the old bowser in the dark sky trick
I could watch this all day. I need a longer version.
Had you started him there would he make his way back to the jail cell ?
Hamster Scofield
At some point I expected this to turn into the Residue Processing level from Half-Life
Go little buddy go! Nothing can stop you!
He is 007 Hamster version.

Are you a Dr? no.
Henry Dusfrene
So THIS is what season 6 looks like.
That's a Cute Hamster
Damnit that was interesting. Now back to studying for my finals.
I love the parts where he/she looks up at you. ‚ÄúAre you watching, watch me!‚Äù
He is as cute as smart
I was really hoping for a zoomed out view of the whole setup.
Shawshank rodention
WHAT IS THIS?? A PRISON FOR ANTS?
I see this hamster making it to a Disney movie where h√® thinks in the start of the movie he is a ninja hamster, at the end he knows huis greatest strenght is huis hart!
This is a person who loves his pet.
https://youtu.be/5XcKBmdfpWs
Sad they only live 3 years
Did it just take him awhile on the cage or what happened in the video it like glitched or something
This takes a massive dump on the "i built my hamster a labyrinth, and he likes it." post.
This looks like a level from Little Big Planet I love it
This is the first award I've spent money on. No regrets
I‚Äôve been studying mouse traps for the better part of my adult life. This is one of the least effective designs I‚Äôve seen.
Hamsters working more than I ever will. Salute to this madlad
A great adventure is waiting for you ahead.
Hurry onward Lemmiwinks, for you will soon be dead.
The journey before you may be long and filled with woe.
Algernon is progressing really well!
I've watched Hamster Hell 2 and will never see this the same way
Someone should make a game like this.....similar to portal without the teleport.
Hamdy Dufresne
Cute
wow, the things a pandemic breeds.
El Chapo?
Pandemics leave you with lots of free time.

Me too.  I watched the whole thing.
Uh oh
ahhhhwww-shank redemption
I‚Äôm more impressed that no poops were made along the way.
Oh no the ball pit!!!!!!
Every squeak is like MF you shittin me
More like escaping Black Mesa
"And that was the last they ever saw of Andy Dufresne."
What a cutie
Halfway through the video my brain started putting music from the original Super Mario Bros. game over this video
Michael Hamsterfield
Well ~~fuck~~ screw that!
Very like
Fabulous! I could watch again and again!
Me: Was it difficult to escape with your life?

Hamster: Actually it was super easy, barely an inconvenience.

Me: Oh really?

Hamster: Yeah, I just ran and chewed. I knew my friend wouldn't let anything bad happen.
This is the BEST post I‚Äôve ever seen.
Did he learn the course first or was this first run? What‚Äôs his motivation? Can he smell the food from far away?
I stg this hamster is smarter than some people I know. Now I'm considering trying to put together an obstacle course for my birdie! They love mental stimulation too and I'm curious to see how she would fare in a little spy scenario
Seem to have a lot of time on your hands but you love your little guy to keep him stimulated
Love it!
This is the cutest and most creative thing I've ever seen!
This hamster is tired, pissed, and won't do anything else for awhile.
Covid-19 got us going crazy.
\*Beep\* \*Beep\* \*Beep\*

"Major fracture detected"

"\*Pshhhhh"
Fuck ya! Abolish all prisons!
Someone had a lot of fun putting this together! Cute and fun
 Think it should get renewed for another season.
This is cool
I love this
What do you mean he escaped? Oh no oh no!
There was a few moments of actual peril in there
But did he get the crystal?!
Never before in history have hamsters been subjected to such odd trials than this period of human existance.
Nice roblox obby!
Real helpful of the prison maintenance workers to add arrow pointing towards the way out.
post to r/nextfuckinglevel
I just love the hampster going around and not knowing what the hell is going on, but props to the guy for taking the time to do that all just for a hampster, hero.
my only regret is that I have but one updoot to give
I laughed so hard üòÇüëçüèª
Seems like this would be stressful for that little dude, and that the Belcher children are so very jealous.
Absolutely stupendous
Calling all units, we have a breakout at Cute Prison,. Please advise, they are armed with cuteness and dangerous if looked in the eyes.
#Zihuatanejo
Lack of hamster poo makes me think he wasn't in there that long
I also had hamsters, they always loved this kind of things, I build them things when I was a kid. As I see this video, I was thinking back about my own hamsters again.
Truman show!!!!
Floofy is the New Black
At 2:45 when it just goes straight into the ball pit hahaha it was like it stood up and ranted at you!
That‚Äôs the kind of dog I want.
I needed this cuteness today. I hope he safely arrives in Zihuatanejo to enjoy the rest of his days.
Too cute
It was all fun and games until he had to chew through that cage. Proud of you hammy hamster!
My hamster would have just chewed a hole through the walls to get out.  Little dude loved shredding cardboard.
Kinda feel bad for the hamster lol
‚ÄúWhy he choose taco night I have no idea‚Äù
I feel like I could even watch an entire movie of that lmao.It was so fun to watch!
I‚Äôm quite certain this is better than Ninja Warrior
That is the smartest, most driven and determined escape ever! It made those bars look like liquorish at the end when it chewed through for the home stretch but the question remains.... What the hell was such an intelligent rat doing in prison?!?
u/SaveThisVideo
Awww squirrel so cute
This is soooo coool!!! :)
That little dude is going to need some therapy after that.
Just like Shawshank.
/u/vredditshare
This is the cutest criminal I‚Äôve ever seen! üòÇüòÇüòÇüêπüêπüêπ
u/savevideo
He did a little ‚Äúchapo tunnel‚Äù
fuck this is cruel
Andy Dufresne. (Shawshank)
Is this fun for them? Id like to think so.
I was concerned for a second when it was stuck in the ball pit but after it used the netting to effortlessly climb out that concern vanished.
It‚Äôs the hamsters versus the mice on this special edition episode of Mini MXC! I‚Äôm Kenny Blankenship and with me as always is my cohost Vic Romano! Vic, let‚Äôs watch as Timothy Tinythunder makes his way through our Jailhouse, of Doom!
Only thing that would make this better is a clip of Jigsaw saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to play a game‚Äù at the beginning
I can‚Äôt believe I watched that whole video.
I thought the exit tube was going to lead him right back into his cell.
Is this a replay of the el chapo escape?
Looks like it has trained its whole life just for this.
this was so fucking cute
It is 2020
The trapdoor and cage drop were definitely my favorite parts. Both times the little guy was clearly asking for help from his human and when he didn‚Äôt get any would just immediately start focusing on how to get out.
I wanna know what he was in for?  Was he innocent?  Does he have a terrible secret?

Seriously this was fun
This stressed me out LMAO
Skills
u/psychedelicvoid
Love towards the end when he's like let me out already
The realm of Hades cannot contain me! 

The fates could not control me! 

But these black bars are doing a damn good job...
Gonna need an overhead map of this for my next dnd session.
I believe that the person who recorded it/made the prison, had more fun than the hamster haha. Still, great stuff
Every time the little guy/gal got stuck I was filled with anxiety.
That‚Äôs awesome
Weird looking prison but okay
Andy Dufresne. The hamster that crawled through a river of shit and came out squeaky clean on the other side.
u/vreddit_bot
That's must have taken ages to make. Fantastic effort.
Hamster Stickmin
I love it
Why was that so captivating?üò´
This is adorable ... is it me or does he look annoyed and fed up at the part where he's chewing the string cage?
u/savevideo
AHH! What is the monster at ~1:00?
I missed the toilet and jailbreak part and started watching when the hamster was on the shifting platform.

I spent the rest of the video wondering why I wasn't hearing the announcers from Takashi's Castle.
This was better than The Shawshank Redemption!
Damn I wish I had that kind of free time.... as I aimlessly scroll through reddit for hours
Shrine difficulty: EXTREME
This video is making me consider canceling Netflix when they increase their price next month.
It reminds me of my rats. I miss them so much.
Best 4 and a half minutes I've ever spent, quite frankly.
hamster is sus. i saw him vent
Good ol quarantine fun
Omg when he looked at the camera with his little button eyes like "what are you doing not helping me!!!!!" So so cute.
This is like watching the police in a movie when a criminal escapes. "The security was flawless"
I don't know man/ma'am this seems a bit too much for this little fella.
My guy really slide out of prison
I fell asleep, woke back up and he was STILL running the course
I needed this. Thank You!
Smart, handsome, committed AND hardworking? This guys got everything!
\[*Mission Impossible* theme plays\]

Can't lie - I gasped out loud when he fell into the "water trap door".
The Shaaaawwwwshank Redemption
That was so intense. I was rooting for him the whole time. Sometimes I didn‚Äôt think he was going to make it.
I want Ozzy man review on this
Brilliant!
This is like a wipeout course for hamsters
Criminal
Some people are seriously bored shitless...
And here's me thinking I'd done well reading more books during lockdown
Holy h\*ll:D

Hats off to the person who create this out of raw materials.

I've smiled all the way through.Incredible
Being 2020, that hamster is more intellectually and physically stimulated than everyone I know, including me.
Are we talking enough about the toll isolation is taking on our collective mental health?
Love it!
El hamstero
the whole time he‚Äôs just saying ‚Äúfuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck‚Äù in hamster
"Not unlike escaping Mother's womb... Gods, what a memory!" -- Phillipe Gaston
  

What is this room normally used for and what engineer said this was ok?
Hamster is that smart to get out of there üòã
This was better than season 8 of GoT
He has to do this every morning
Wait. The toilet just empties into a room? Eww
‚ÄúWho designed this @%$&! prison!?‚Äù
what a cutie!!
Yes
El Chapo!!
Pretty cool to watch. A little dystopian at the end to escape to a fake outside ‚Äústill in prison‚Äù. 

Like the show the prisoner/ Truman show
Whoever put this together wins the internet today. Congrats!
Dude your cat is fire!!!
Rodent Takeshi's Castle.


This is like 1000 times better than Stuart Little.
Just the initial move of the toilet is better than I‚Äôve ever done in an escape move.
Could've done without the cheesy visual effects but otherwise enjoyed watching. Also, moving obstacles don't seem to be the hamster's strong suit.
after all this hamster like nah man prison wasn't that bad
OMG! This was the best thing I‚Äôve seen this week!!! What a determined little thing üòç
How many hams did it take to complete the course?
MORE!!!!!!
thats cute
The replay when it falls in the ball pit was priceless
That is awesome!  Really enjoyed watching!
Quarantine hits everybody differently.
Hahahah loooove this
Just got home after a long medic shift, crawled into bed and my wife asked me what I am watching, 

I say ‚ÄúI am watching a hamster escape prison‚Äù 


She just turned over and went back to sleep, I will not be getting any but hell.. that video was worth every second.
You are a monster!
Better than most of the movies or shows I've watched. Kudos to this badass guy.
It truly was a Shawshank Redemption.
Hahaha, Well done!!
You put lava under the rope bridge! You twisted son' bitch.
This is so cute! üòÖüòÖüôà

Hamster Ninja Warrior
The things i do for some cheese
So cute
Super creative and very adorable. Well done :)

But how did you get the lava in there?!?!
Shawshank redemption.
That was pretty good! They're going through this thinking "come on!!" Also ..what kind of prison is this!?!? Lol.
What kind of hammy is this it‚Äôs so cute
You should have connected the last exit back to its cell.
I think this might be staged.
