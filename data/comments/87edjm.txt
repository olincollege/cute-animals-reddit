Dog looks happy to just flop on the couch and discuss the day.
That smile is like jet fuel.
Someone smarter than me please explain this to me.

Dogs don’t actually smile right?  I’ve seen dogs make that face when coughing or sneezing. And panting looks like a smile but is usually for cooling down or to reduce stress.

So what is this dog actually doing? Is that a happy smile or just something else that just happens to look cute as hell?

Wow! This is my dog!!! Her name is Shortake. Sooo Cool!

Redondo Beach Dog Park?
I love it when dogs smile like this. there should be a subreddit specifically dedicated to dog smiles like the one depicted here.
Someone mutilated her ears. Sad.
I needed to see this!:)
Had a shit day but came here and saw this. This made me feel warm and smiley. Thank you ⭐
I like dogs SO much more than I like actual human beings.
Eeeek! That ‘lil nose twitch at the end!

Mutt did 911

Pitbull did 9/11
Ohhhhh be still my heart! 
PIT SMILES CAN MELT STEEL BEAMS
Investigate 3/11
I really weird sound escaped me when that smile hit me 
Like the overweight Italian mob henchman who just learned that one of the neighborhood perks is free ice cream at the parlor.
Awww such a happy smiling smoof. 
This look like my grandpa
Right when i saw the title to this i knew they were going to be a lot of 9/11 jokes and i was not disappointed

God I love pits. Such a beautiful breed. 
I used to (like many) consider them dangerous due to the negative media portrayal and had no prior experience with them.

Long story short, a homeless 3 year old pitbull and I crossed paths. It was late and I took her home with me, as she was extremely docile, friendly, and previously abused. Idk how to explain it but I knew immediately I could trust her. Told roommates and parents back home (I was out of state in college) I'd bring her to the shelter. 

Needless to say she's still with me 5 years later. Fell in love with her immediately and couldn't think of a valid reason to ever bring her to a shelter. She's helped save my life in many ways, as cliche as that sounds, helping me out of my  'rock bottom' point in life. 

A week ago she had a mass cell tumor removed along with removal of a possible other tumor. Just got the news today that the 2nd possible tumor was benign, and lab work showing the cancer from tumor was unable to spread throughout her body. Happiest news I've heard in a while, as I'm still beaming as I type this out while hearing her snore loudly next to me. 

I apologize for the long vent, but God I love my pit and am amazed at the love and joy they can bring to people's lives. your life. Very thankful that she'll be able to stick around for a while :')
Serious question: I know that some breeds "smile" more than others. When dogs smile like that, are they actually happy, or is it something else?
That's a good looking pup...
Damn, dat comfort level...
Clipping dogs ears is psychopathic. 
I dropped my head to say “aww” immediately that baby is so precious
Send help the supports on my home melted due to cuteness!!! i am trapped
And my heart
Welp, hes seduced me
:)
:3
Aweee fuckkk 😍

Awww that smile made me shed  a tear, made my day thank you!
Dog smiles can't melt steel beams.
Do all dogs smile? My puppy never smiles. He swings his tail in excitement but never smiles.
naww who's a good boy..
Is s/he really smiling?
Why did I smile back when he smiled at me? It was just an involuntary thing...
Pit bulls have the dorkiest, cutest smiles!
I initially misread OP’s username with a “t” where it’s really a “p”. :-/
Not for me. Different strokes for different folks
Thanks— I really needed that!
I wish i was as happy as this dog

Lady Shortcake is the cutest. I just wanna give her some kisses!

I love all dogs, but I got a special place in my heart for pits. They are just such sweet misunderstood dogs, I hate that they have such a bad reputation and so many people are scared of them.
I had to smile back 😁
Getting a pit bull Easter day! Can't wait to pick her up from the foster 
Dogs don’t smile.

Despite popular belief, Pits are the sweetest!!!
What a sweet boi 
My pit smiles just the same, especially when you scratch his tummy and legs
He/she is invited to my house at any time. All treats and love will be provided. 
Aww the little nose wiggle at the end
And the tail that can break steel.

God, if I could adopt a pittie I would. There's a beautiful doggo that looks just like my old dog scooter that I want to rescue but I doubt my apartment will let me. 
I fucking love pitbulls. 
That smile could melt superman 
My heart melts when my pitties smile like this!! What a beautiful dog

You're so heccin precious when you do a smile.
What minute does it start chewing babies?
Happy pit, happy life
This is way too cute!!!!
adorable.  
Ohhhhhh, I just want to snuggle that happy puppers! 
I want to give this dog everything 
I instantly smiled too
Instead of banning pitbull like most of the comments call for cant we just stop breeding them or only breed them with muts so the genetic traits die out
I really like the rock couch

Man, I was not ready for that.
Gosh, I can’t wait for my 9 week old land shark to become a big ol teddy bear. But I’m sure I’ll miss it soon after 😅
Was I the only one expecting to see George W Bush smile? 
OH MY GAWDDDDDDDDDD
I smiled when he smiled
:)
God damn it I need a dog so bad
So not named Jet Fuel, I take it?
He smiles, I smile.
It seems like you told the dog to smile and it did 
Thing with a smile that lays a pile..

Is that the El Segundo dog park?
Pibbles are the best!  Can't beat that smile!

She’s beautiful!
Unpopular opinion but I don't think anyone should be allowed to own a pit bull. 
Such a cute diggyy.
The Lady Shortcake is one of my fave insta feeds.  Pure joy in that face!  
I wish all dog's smiles were as prominent as Pitbull smiles. Those are just straight up beyond amazing.
[deleted]
I don't get it? I thought i was going to see something melting or was this just /r/titlegore? 
To the OP... Is that doggo missing any teeth?  I had a chihuahua who sadly left us, but he had horrible teeth, so since he lost quite a few he had a smile like that.
Guess I'm made of adamantium then.
GEORGE BUSH DID 9/11
And to think that a lot of apartments won't let that smile live in their complex. Sad!
Mmm the warm bench feels good on the sack.
Doggo looks so relaxed.
San Clemente?
“Ladies”
But steel is heavier than feathers
Excuse me while I go find a bear to punch to feel like a man again.
Are you telling me that that dog did 9/11?
This dog was at 9/11?
Butch did 9/11 confirmed.
When you mom says to smile for the picture but you're not really in the mood.
First thing in this sub that actually made me say aww out loud
Is that a pit? If so I’ll be the first to admit that breed scares me, but when I saw that smile my heart melted!! What a cute and special dog!!!
GOOD AND PURE
Even though I've had some random incidents with my roommates pit and my dog, fortunately minor, I still love that dog. He's so loving and eager to please. And yes, that smile.  We keep them separate, but give them equal loving. My dog is no match for him, even though he thinks he is. 
that doggo looks so friendly with that smile
Why. So. Serious?
So cute!!! 
Because no one really gets it.

Yes, Pit Bulls can be Dangerous, they are a very destructive Breed.

But that's if they are Wild/ were trained that way, if a Pit is raised with love and care, it won't attack unless its instinct's tell it too.

Source : i have a Pit/Bull Terrier mix, and he hasn't bitten anyone, i question if he even can.
I love those pibbles!!! Good baby! Awww smiles all around. One day!!!
The sweetest smile that I ever seen!!! 💖💖💖💖
When you done munching on toddlers and lay down for a nap
Want tummy rubs? Because this is how you get tummy rubs. :)
with a smile like that, doggo can fart on my couch anytime
Dogs don't smile.

>That smile can melt steel

Guess who just got 9/11 done
How can that have a bad rep?
its a 911 conspira-dog!  I know it wasn't jet fuel!!
George bush hates him
OH. MY. GOD.

I can die now. I can die right now and be okay with it because this dog exists.
Doggos did 9/11
But its a pitbull so we have to kill it. /s
False. My heart is as cold as ice, and, after watching this several times, I'm still dead inside with the desire to be dead outside.
