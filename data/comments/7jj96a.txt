My pup always thinks she's coming with me up until the very last minute. Heart breaking stuff :(
My parents would always make me take the dogs on a walk before anyone brought down a suitcase. it makes the pups so sad when they see one. 
Or he's sick of his favorite human's shit and he's packing his bags to go stay with his mom while you guys work some things out. 
After just one time, my dogs both knew what a suitcase meant. It makes me feel guilty every time I go on vacation
My dogs will be picked up by our family vet (they love her) before we go out on vacations. If she's at the door, it's like we don't even exist anymore.

"Hey our vet is here, okgottagotakecarebyeeeee"

"I still have to open the door, you know."

"Well, hurry up human! Okgottagotakecarebyeeeee!!"
I just leave my suitcase in the bedroom at all times now.  At least my boy is used to it now and doesn't get sad until the last minute.
My dog's first owner never came home from Iraq :(

 I didn't realize that she understood what suitcases meant until I packed one and she crapped all over the floor when she saw it. So I had to start taking her to boarding before I could pack. A few years later she's better - I can at least have the suitcases out for a couple weeks in advance and she doesn't panic. 
That poor baby. He‚Äôs going to think about you like 3 times a second until you come back. What torture!
**My cat did not die while I was out of town**

Last summer I had to go out of town for work. When I was packing, my 14 year old cat insisted on sitting in my suitcase. I'd move him out of the suitcase and by the time I put something else in, he'd have jumped back in. This was the first time he'd ever been that persistent with showing his displeasure of me packing. Usually he just sat next to the suitcase as I was packing or laid on top of it after I was done. He was coping with kidney failure at the time and it broke my heart to leave him. But, I had an awesome pet sitter and he lived a few months longer after I got home. He was a great cat and I still miss him a bunch.

(Edited to add note at the beginning)
My cat peed in my bag when I was packing to go on vacation. He knew what he was doing. Asshole. 
That is cutest ever!!!!! He‚Äôs a good boy!
"Nope, hooman.  You are vacationing right here in the crate with me."
My half lab literally shut down if she saw any kind of suit case.

she would get depressed and go hide in a corner upstairs.

even when the entire family wasn't gone she would mope until people came home.

the first time we made the mistake of a kennel. the second time we used an open air kennel doggy day care type place and she was literally pissed off for 3 months after.

she was also great at smuggling tennis balls inside.
Dogs are great, but I can't bring myself to own one because they are a responsibility. I'm too selfish with my free time to do that.

... I need a dog in my life
We just got a new set of carry on suitcases. We excitedly opened them up, but our dog got very sad and whiny all of a sudden. Poor girl. But when we're away she stays with grandma, who spoils her with treats and lots of walkies, and she gets to hang out with her cousin dog. So it's not too too terrible.
This is just a video of an actual Delta employee losing our luggage. 
‚ÄòRoooh no. No you don‚Äôt. I‚Äôll just.. *nnngg.. nng..* put this right here.

Perfect. Hooman never come in my house.

So hooman stay in big house.

Now.. treats plz.‚Äô
"If you're going anywhere, you're staying with me."
Makes you wonder if animal‚Äôs really don‚Äôt have some level and/or form of abstract thought. Because that looks like the dog formatted a basic plan of ‚Äúif they can‚Äôt have this, then they can‚Äôt leave.‚Äù
"boss, trip's canceled.  yea, i can't leave my dog.  yea.. no.. fine then i quit.."
My dog is going to do this next week lol. But he gets to go to my mom's house where all his puppy cousins are so he gets a vacay too.
When the suitcase comes out, my cat lays down on top of it and cries while I try to pack.
he means ‚Äúif you really want a vacation, come to the cage and stay with me "
That's crazy. I always believed that animals are able to see the future. Our old dog had always been nervously waiting at our front door 10 minutes before my parents arrived late in the evening. I used him as an alert system and stopped playing PC in the night... ;)
I hope you're impressed by what you see here.

What is happening here is serious cognition on the part of the dog:

- *understanding*: master is going away and I won't be coming. I do not like that idea.

- *conception*: if master doesn't have the black thing he always takes when he's going away for a long time without me, he can't leave.

- *planning*: I'm going to take the black thing master takes along when he's going away for a long time and put it in my kennel so he can't leave!

- *execution*: negotiate two [at least two] obstacles while dragging a big and lumpy thing across the room and hide it as far back as possible in the kennel.

**Plan completed**: master does not have the big black box, now he can't leave!

Tell me again that animals cannot cogitate and think ahead.
I have just experienced a major heart crack
My ex's dog did this when I left. It made it even more ruff
In the process of packing a bag my dogs usually decide that the suitcase with clothes in it is the perfect place to lie down and take a nap.
After coming home from college my freshmen year for winter break, my dog was like oh holy shit he's home everything is back to normal!!!

But the morning of my return flight to school at the end of break, he found me sitting on the couch and my bags packed by the door. He looked back and forth between me and the bags a few times and  then realized what it meant. I'll never forget the heartbroken look on his face.

But then he just sighed (snorted, really, cus he's a chunky boy) and came and sat on my lap so we could get some more quality time in before I had to leave. That cycle repeated every time I left for school/came back.
If my dog did this I just wouldn‚Äôt leave the house anymore
In my head I would be like ‚Äúguess I‚Äôm staying home forever now‚Äù
Dogs, they can't talk, but they sure as hell will let you know what they mean.
MAH HEART IS HURTING. DON'T LESVE THAT GOOD BOY
This is killing me.  I'm getting ready to leave the country for 10 days and all I can think about is how much my cat is going to miss me.  These videos on reddit of humans returning to their dogs...  that's my cat.  She doesn't hold a grudge like some do.  When I return from a trip she won't stop nuzzling me or leave my side for about a day and I'm told that after about the third day of me being gone, she wanders the house crying for me.  :-(
My 3lb yorkie wishes he could do this lol
This is the saddest thing I've seen all day.
Well that just about broke my heart
Aw man the day was going great but now i gotta spend rest of the evening in my bed thinking how we don't deserve dogs
Knowing that suitcase mean travel is easy for pets. Thinking that without suitcase, the human will stay is advanced thinking ! 
They say you should treat a dog's crate as their own personal safe place, not a punishment or holding cell. This dog feels that his crate is so safe, the humans won't even invade his space to get the suitcase back.
Looks like he's ready to go too. Even packed all the stuff the owner needs.
Are you sure he's not just a sky cap looking for a tip?
And that‚Äôs when I‚Äôd instantly be cancelling my vacation.
It may seem adorable, but it makes me sad as hell.
When I was an OTR driver I would be gone for 3-4 weeks at a time. My dog used to lay on my duffle bag so I couldn‚Äôt leave. 
"Hey Mom, I can't make it for the holidays. My dog was really sad when I started packing."

"Perfectly understandable, sweetie. I'll mail your gifts to you."
When I get the suitcase out, my dogs know they get to go to the hoomans' grandparents with a big fenced in yard. My boy dog loves to pee on Grammy's furniture. Thankfully she takes it in stride. My parents replaced their carpet with tile because of their dogs. Tldr: I'm lucky 
My dogs are tiny chihuahuas and if they were as big as this guy, they‚Äôd pull this same thing.

Every time I pack, they continually jump on top of the clothes, they always wanna come with.

It breaks my heart and also makes me feel loved. At least someone loves me! (cries)
My cat will sit on my suitcase when I am packing.  I like to think it's her way of trying to stop me but she likes to sit on weird shit so she probably doesn't give a shit üò¢
Currently on vacation; currently missing my doggo tremendously :c
Aw man, so hard to leave love like that. Cute doggie!
My brother's dog would do this with his car keys. She'd steal them and hide them in the fluff on the bottom of her crate, then lay on them like "nope, no clue where the thing you're looking for is" 
I do love how cute dogs are when they realize they've backed themselves into a corner. It's like "crap! Uhh... don't leave."
Are dog cages a thing? My dogs were never caged. They just sleep on dog beds. Just wondering
I wanna be loved like this. 
Right in the feels üò¢
My dog sits in my luggage while i try to pack. He wants to go with me. :(
My dog always gets into my duffle bag or suitcase and won't let me pack, I'll shoe her out and put something in, turn around and she tucks herself back in. It fucking kills me
How can anyone leave after thatüò©
Watching animals express their understanding of causality is *adorable*.
He's definitely well fed
Labs are the clingiest girlfriend in the world. 
Haha my dogs are way too stupid to understand what suitcases mean. 
OOHHMYYYYYGOOOD IM CRYING WITH JOY!!
You get in that cage right now and the two of you never leave
This is why I don't go on vacations lol.
I would totally cancel my vacation after seeing this
Here's a related fun fact! Dogs are glorious creatures.
"Get the fuck back in the house you sorry excuse of a human being... who will scoop my poop if you're gone?"
I want the video version of it. Anyone?
You shall not vacation.
Awww....
Thats why I always pack an extra suitcase. 
Hit me right in the feels
Hooman better not leave his dog or i'm calling the cops
I think my heart just broke.
Awww thats so cute.
*hooman
And let's just...ok...right through here and...back to my cage...and in we go and nope.  You can't go it's in the cage already.  Sorry.
Aww... my Golden Retrievers also seemed to know whenever we were going anywhere. They would stake out by the door or try to put their toys in our bags when we were packing. One day when I went on my class camping trip, I arrived and opened my bag to find a Rawhide Bone at the top. That was fun to explain to my cabinmates.
Me irl. Except it's cute when a dog does it. 
My cat does something similar when I get ready to leave in the morning. He'll come up flop down on my feet so I can't get dressed. Then he just keeps doing silly shit to get me to pet him instead of leaving. Then when I get home he HAS to do the kitty greeting thing, rubbing his nose on my nose, otherwise he gets weird. Like he has to greet me or it bugs the shit out of him.
Oh my poor heart!  This beautiful pupper is devastated.
How can you possibly resist to that and leave? 
Wrong strategy.  Should have poo'd and pee'd on it
Well, if he doesn't have this thing, he can't go anywhere!
That's the saddest thing I've ever seen. Don't leave him human!
False, he doesn't want his favorite human to go on vacation without him!
Holy shit, we had a cat who was like that with my wife.  She'd get her suitcase out and he'd alternate between sitting in the same room as her but always keeping his back to her and sitting on the suitcase so she couldn't open it.
I don‚Äôt care where you‚Äôre going, take this good boy with you!
dogs are the best. so pure. why can't dogs run the world </3
Take the dog with you
We do not deserve the love dogs give us. 
 For the love of God, take him with you! 
If my dog ever did this to me, I‚Äôd cancel my plans and just stay home and have a movie/belly rub marathon with my dog. But sadly my dog hates me lol so vacation it is!
That is adorable. I love my dog and dogs in general are better than most people. Pure of heart and intent. Love them. 
"Look, I called the top dog, and you're not going. It's been cancelled. Here, I'll put your bag away. You're welcome."
Sweet little guy. :)
I love that part at the very end where you see his eyes blink in adorable defiance.
I don‚Äôt think his owner wanna leave him either.:3
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to have to take me if you want you‚Äôre luggage.‚Äù
Aww so cute üòç
Every time our 7 year old Shih Tzu, Gizmo sees a bag being packed he takes it as an invitation. Even as you continue to pack around him, he will stay in the bag. 
My Bichon Frise, Sugar, used to hop on the kitchen counter and steal my wallet, then go hide somewhere with it.
Well, that‚Äôs it. Cancel your plans. 
Did it work? Did you go on vacation without your suitcase? I‚Äôm assuming you never got it back.
Or he wants you to have your vacation in his kennel
I would cancel and stay
D'awww
He needs to go on r/codependent
Aww those sad eyes!
No take, only stay.
Poor boy :(
this is the best thing i've ever seen
FUCK SAKES SOMEONEY GONA SE MY CRYNG AT WORK 
MY HEART üò≠
My dog died when I was on vacation last Christmas. This shit hit me right in the feels, RIP Hurley 
My ex had the greatest little long haired Chihuahua. Every time my ex would start to pack a suitcase, the Chihuahua would try to get in it.
Thank you for not typing "hooman". 
That precious little angel! I could never leave, even for a week, without my dogs and cats. I'd miss them too much.
I don't understand why people lock their dogs in those kennel cages at night.  If you have a dog, why not give it the run of the house at night?  Then it can function as security.
Cat would have just pissed on it. Regardless of whether or not you were going on vacation.
His favorite human doesn't deserve him. I don't care if his human is mother Theresa, the pope, or even the son of God himself. 

That pup should live in a place where there is atleast 20 humans that only exist for his benefit, who all shower him with cuddles and kisses and treats all day, every day. 

Pups.. what have we humans done to deserve them?
This is dedication. 
My dog doesn‚Äôt like the suitcases either
Dogs are damned smart, my girl knew something was up as a puppy when we packed up for our first trip, this is so cute
Doggy curb-side checking.  Don't forget to tip him.
His human must go on vacation quite often. At least often enough to make his dog associate the suit case with him leaving.
Looks like a staycation it is!
Meanwhile my dog's dumb ass never figured this out
Dear Lord. Too, too cute!!
Dogs are so pure!
Source?
Sawce, please? Thank you in advance.
Good boy :)
Aww that's cute, my dog just gets diarrhea and shits in my suit case when she sees me packing. She has separation anxiety so I pretty much have to leave her outside or give her doggy Xanax (that she has prescribed) when I pack.
What breed is this dog?
Human:  Hey bud, can I have my suitcase back?  Ive got to go soon.

Good boy: https://giphy.com/gifs/the-office-no-steve-carell-12XMGIWtrHBl5e
nice dig
That shit is awesome
interesting
Okay, that's cute. 
My grandparents have a miniature poodle who hates when they travel. If he sees a suitcase, he will instantly pee on it in protest.  
Your dog is adorable 
Hi
You leave! I leave! You stay! I stay!
Dogs are our greatest resource.
My cats will just piss in your luggage... You don't have to be going anywhere, you just have to have your luggage out.
Just texted my wife saying we aren‚Äôt going away for a weekend in January. Hit me right in the feels. This should be marked nsfw. 
My cats try to stow away in my suitcase. Then they hide under the bed when the carriers come out.

It's not pretty. I've learned to close the bedroom doors before pulling out the carriers, then they have less places to run.
E M O T I O N S B O Y
My dog would sit in my suitcase but she didn't understand that she was coming with me because she grew to resent them. 
My boyfriend and I visited his aunt and uncle for Thanksgiving break. They had a doggy. When it came down to the time to pack up the car and leave he saw the suitcases. He started growling at us and barking. His aunt told us he does that when he sees suitcases because he knows that he won't see them for a long time. We packed up eye car and when we came back he was okay and playing with us since the suitcases were out of sight.
Or that is a suitcase full of peanut butter
Labra-won‚Äôt-go
And my cat pees in every open suitcase she sees. She never pees outside the litter box, except suitcases. Including guests. I‚Äôve had too many nasty surprises after 27 hour long journeys. I have no idea when she does it, because I never notice until I‚Äôm halfway across the world. 
Plot twist: the dog packed the bag and the human doesn‚Äôt want the dog to go, so the dog makes the human feel better by sitting in his kennel with his suitcase for a little bit and when the human falls asleep doggo will depart. 
sniff, sniff, sob - so touching
Heartbreaking. I've gotta go back to the UK for 3 weeks, gonna miss my Little buddy
Ah, dog logic. I see him putting on shoes, then he leaves without me. If hide his shoes he can't leave me!
1st class ticket to Guiltvile please 
The blink at the end
"Your trunk is my castle."
 
  ~ Dog, 2017
I remember the last time my dog carried my suitcase into his cage, I reached inside to get it and next thing I know he knocks me out on the back of my head with his feet. And I woke up locked in a cage with my dog holding a sign with his mouth saying I‚Äôm not allowed to go on vacations.
Trips cancelled
Is that suitcase made by Kong?
That's a suitcase not a human
Now THAT... is a good boy
My aunts dog, Louie. He is a very good boy.
My dog knows. 

My dog don't care.
You can check out anytime you like

But you can Neveeer Leeeaaave 

[steals luggage]
Our oldest dog hates it when suitcases come out and always starts to sulk. Then once we're back she's happy to see us for a minute then spends the next 24 hours being mad at us for leaving her.
this is damn adorable...the owner must go on vacation quite a bit for the dog to pick up on this....adorable as fuck though.
Why did I read this as "hooman"?
not taking your dog with you? wow just wow
My friends had to pack in secret because their Dane would lose her hair. She was a black Dane with a white spot but as soon as she realized they were leaving she would start turning grey and losing giant patches of hair. Talk about a guilt trip.
Either that or he found the bag with the drugs in it.
Why are they so good at making us feel guilty over the smallest things??
[Brings this to mind...](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epitaph_to_a_Dog)
This is why I love dogs.
can a brother get some sauce on this one?
My pups know what the suitcase means every time. They jump inside and give me sad face so I can‚Äôt pack. 
Alright this is a sign that you can never go on vacation.
Cancel the vacation you monster!!
He's doing what he can to pack himself up to be taken too.
That‚Äôs so cute
I don't think he doesn't want you to go, but wants you to take him with you. 
I like how at the end he‚Äôs like *oh now you don‚Äôt want to lock me in my cage*
Yeah, I would just stay home.
that‚Äôs it... cancel all vacations forever!!!!!!!
Reminds me of my dog.
This is the kind if thing that will make me think about not going on vacation. 
Ahhh, today is the last day of my vacation. I can‚Äôt wait to go home and see my little kitty, he gets terribly upset when he sees suitcases too. Luckily we didn‚Äôt use the big ones this time though. Last time we left for two weeks, and he definitely lost weight :( 
This is the first time I‚Äôve ever audibly said ‚Äúawww‚Äù before. 
Other human can GTFO.
My dogs would just look at me and do nothing üòØ
My parents cat hates when they leave on vacation too, only she pees in their suitcase... Cats sure have a strange way of showing affection.
D O N T G O
My cat sits in the suitcase while I'm trying to pack.  Not sure if she loves me, or is an obstructionist jerk, or just likes sitting inside rectangles.
He looks just like my boy. He cries every time I get my luggage out. ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
xD
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9lg1gSnQJA
That blink at the end.
My cat knows when we are going on vacation by the suitcase too.  He gets anxious and pukes everywhere. 
that's why i can't get dogs. going on vacation and leaving the puppy for horrendous costs at some dog kindergarten...
Spelled human without double O's, fuck it have an upvote 
i wouldn't know what to do if my dog did that to me.
Take him with you. 
My dogs always knew what the suitcase meat... they‚Äôre going to the kennels... but we turned it around by always putting treats in the suitcase when we bring them out (yummies for doggies!) and when we come back we always bring back a couple toys ( YEAH! TOYS!! ) so they now look with excitement to the suitcases! 
But they still end up in the kennels.....üò¢... the most bloody expensive ones we can afford!
dah god...vacation canceled right there
You monster.
Take this good boye with you !!!
NEVER LEAVE AGAIN YOU MONSTER
>No.

-Dog in crate
"I'll call you a cab" 

-Cat, probably 
He‚Äôs going to poop in your shoes from being so upset 
Better love story than Twilight
My dog would do this if he was big enough, he LOOSES HIS SHIT when he sees a suitcase.
I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm crying
Most of the time, my dog comes along on trips, so when the suitcase comes out she gets super excited
This was one of the first things I saw when I woke up..

Today is gonna be a good day.   What a good boy!! 
That's so cute
good boye
Easy solution: pretend you are blind and have your best friend with you the whole time
The amount of distress in his eyes says it all
My doggo knows we're leaving him when we pull the suitcases out and proceeds to ignore us. 
When we were kids our Australian shepherd knew we were going to school when we put our jackets on. Eventually she started trying to remove our jackets by biting the sleeves every morning.
Dogs don't have object permanence so whenever you leave they think you are never coming back, which makes this kind of thing A THOUSAND TIMES SADDER 
Get back in the house
Dog wanted to go.
Coolest Dogs ever, I love my lab!
r/aww posts usually start very cute then very sad
Oh, the poor thing!  He loves his human so much!
I mean he just invited his favorite human to his house. Perfect vacations!
So adorable 
100% proof right here that vacations / holidays are evil and need to be banned for all pet owners.
Do. Not. Go. Without. That. Doggo.

Fucking monster.
I just think that he knows if you leave he won't get fed 
I travel a lot for work and the looks my dog gives me every time I pull out my suitcase, it just breaks my heart
This makes me so fucking sad and happy at the same time
I N S U B O R D I N A T I O N B O Y E 
That sad blink at the end just kills me. 
So cute
Oh man this made me laugh so hard. 

Thanks very much the person who posted it.

I am always so surprised that dogs are so clever that they can recognize suitcases as objects of abandonment.

I always impressed by intelligence of Dogs.
"If you leave me, can I come too?"
Bork
My pup just sits in my suitcase so I can‚Äôt pack it.. 
vacation to the inside of his dog house human geeze
Should've pack doggo in the suitcase.
Sir let me get that bag for you, and right this way to your suite.. shared by me. Welcome to vacation.
This is r/wholesome quality stuff :')
My dogs pout as soon as they see my suitcases. Gets me every time. 
This is so adorable. It is a bit sad, but it just shows how much the pupper cares for it's human.
i would cancel my vacantion
My cat does this!...Except instead of taking the luggage, she sleeps in/on it. 
I miss my dog.
My dogs terrified of travel bags
"I'm sorry I can't come home for the holidays."


"Why not?"


"My dog refuses to give my suitcase back. I tried treats and promised to give his balls back. Nothing worked."
You‚Äôll never find it in here!
I visit my parents and bring my dog every few weeks. The suitcase quickly went from "Nooo don't leave me human :((" to "YES YES YES CAR RIDE GOING TO GRANDMAGRANDPAS HOUSE GONNA SEE OTHER DOG HECK YES LET'S GO"

I always get a cup of whipped cream (Puppuccino) for her on long car rides. Gotta create that positive association.
Either that or he‚Äôs taking the suitcase in his cage to hump. 
My cat always sleeps on my suitcase
lol
Every time we bring out the suitcases, my cat just sits in it and pout.
Aww doggo

‚ÄúYou want a holiday? There‚Äôs a holiday in here!‚Äù
That would break my heart
That's so sad! I'd have a hard time going after seeing that.
It's funny how he knows the cage is his personal space and no one's allowed to enter.
:')
This is my dog every time I leave to go back to college after coming home. He probably thinks I'm so rude. 
Don't you dare go on vacation.
D'aw 
Good god, what did we do to deserve such love and devotion from dogs?
Drug dog in another dog life... add coffee
Poor doggo! He needs a vacation too. 
My little Roma used to hate when we went on vacation. She would be so happy the first day we came back and then she would be pissy for a week after we got back just to let us know she was happy to see us again but really upset that we left. 
My old dog used to sit in suitcases when we were packing them
Hooman go no where. Hooman stay. 
No go, only stay.
no. hooman stay! 
I see these, and just wonder how the fuck they keep their house so clean with a dog living there.

Mine will arbitrarily knock whatever she sees on the floor, or shred something and leave it for me to find.
Mine takes the towels out of my suitcase when im not looking and starts to tear them up, has access to the towel rack all the time , but only when im packing to go somewhere does he do that. 
He wants to go with
"I am taking this until you can learn to be responsible with it"
Uh yeah no sorry you aint leaving me again hooman
Nooooooooo!!!!!! 
Luckily my two go to my parents a few times a week when both my wife and my own working hours class beyond 5 hours. So they happily stay there when we go away. I still hate leaving them tho. It is a shame we cannot take them. 
You evil people leaving a poor pupper to fend for himself!
Oh bless his heart,i'd be crying like a girl!
You no leave me with bad dog babysitter human.
My pup loves it when I go on vacation. She gets to spend a week at daycare. 
Makes me sad. I wish I could bring them everywhere i go, but i just can't!
Pure.
My heart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My üêï gets upset and down every morning when I take out my bag to go to work. He's really hates that bag
Awww so adorable!! 
That‚Äôs so heart warming 
My dog does this, except instead of stealing my suitcase, he boys my Achilles tendons and it hurts like hell
Aw its so cute
lol
D'you think he thinks his owner is going to the dog park for like a week straight without him 
When I was a kid, we had these large fiberglass bins (US Army shipped our belongings overseas in them, and let us keep them) that we used to pack our things for Summer Vacations in.  When ever we got these bins out, one of our dogs would climb into the bin, we assumed it was so we wouldn't leave her behind.  It was so precious!!

Btw: All our vacations were planned to allow the dogs to come with us if possible.  Only one family vacation I can remember when the dogs didn't come with us.
Um...i thought I was his favorite human...? :'-?
You stay.  I go.
Lol. He doesn't want to be lonely. 
How do your dog do that. 
Oh, so you're fine
Damn you! Now I'm tearing up at work; so adorable. Do you leave him often? 
Why do you hurt me so? 
my rescue broke the plastic floor piece of his crate. he also was able to get out of it even if i zip tied the edges of that thing. he's still my good boy. 
"I trained my dog to drag a suitcase into a crate"
He just wants to be packed too
This is why I ended up buying an r.v.
"Follow mi dear hooman customer, dis wai plis. Dis are your room"
This little guy is so adorable!

Or the dog is just being a dick and stealing your suitcase 
You‚Äôve gotta distract the pup and sneak the suitcases outside so he doesn‚Äôt see them and try to sabotage your vacation with an acute case of the feels making you want to stay home. 

My cat likes to sit/sleep on top of my suitcase right before and after a trip, I'm guessing because he doesn't want me to leave (he definitely hates travelling). He never does it when the suitcase is in storage.
Absolutely identical to my Lab physically. And if he's anything like mine temperment-wise, he's only doing it to be a jerk lol
My cat doesn't care when I leave for vacation but she ignores me when I come home because she's mad. I always have to give her treats so she'll come near me again lol
Thats adorable. Makes me think of my dog when he runs away with his toys when I pack for a trip
Usually happens when you're leaving them. Either they won't let you walk away or look at you in such a way that you cannot walk away from those eyes. This is the 3rd and most effective way they use to stop their family. True friend.
Looks like he wants a staycation. 
My cat would stay at the kennel when I was traveling for work, she knew the routine, out came the black travel luggage, then she would go into the cat carrier, off to the kennel. 

I put the bag on the bed, walk out the room, come back, she was inside the bag, peeing.    She knew.  

She is really a 1 person cat, only likes me (after a long time of treats she even allows belly rubs). She was a rescue.   Hates everyone else.   

Hated the kennel, but she was most lovable cat for a week after I came back.


You have to take him!!!
That's just fucking precious
I'd never go anywhere.  
‚ÄúYou may not go on a vacation, slave!‚Äù 
Man, all my dog does is sleep and groan all day.

Though to be fair, she's in her teens and has gray hair.
Clearly only humans have souls
So nice to read about all your pets and how much they love you. My doggies react to all sorts of things I do or say as if I said loudly: Shall we go out for a walk? For example when I comb my hair, when I close my laptop, when I say "zo" (= well) they get all exited. When I actually leave without them they stand on the couch with their front paws on the windowsill and stare at me through the window with sad eyes, making me feel very mean.

i wuv the wuppies :)
You're not going anywhere without this. No, sir...
If my chihuahua could do that... She probably would.. It's like animals knows something is up when they see luggage...
Now Cynthia, you know where you go, I go. Have we not had this discussion already? Try an leave me again and ill eat the couch!
My dog always does this kind of stuff too, it‚Äôs kinda funny because he looks so defeated afterwards.
Our labrador gets depressed when she realizes that we're going somewhere but after a while just forgets it and just goes to take a nap
Our cat will lay on our suitcase and refuse to move, or hop inside and demand to come. She knows too...
Nope,nope,nope,nope,nope,nope,nope,nope.
Seems to me like he doesn't want his favorite suitcase to go on vacation.
‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm never leaving my dogs again! :-( They would do this too if they were big enough!  ......or eh-hum....smart enough
If my dog did this , I don't think I could go ! How freaking cute ! Lol
This is overwhelmingly heartbreaking 
Awww!
My cat is like this with my big green bag that I pack all of my clothes in. 

Every time I pack said clothes, I do it in my living room so I can sort everything out and make sure I've got everything before I begin packing. Every time I do this my cat gets on the bag and just sits on it and stares me down. I've had her for 10 years, she knows what that bag means. 
DON'T LEAVE HIM. D:
The question here is are we gonna get to see when the dogs reaction to when the human comes home?
It's scary how much control dogs have over a feeble human mind...
I kiss my dog's forehead and tell her I love her whenever I can't take her. She understands that it means she can't come and it breaks my heart :(
A few years back whenever I would come home from vacation my cats would make it a point to urinate on my luggage.

Not exactly sure what that meant 
At first glance it looked like he was dragging a black lab around..

my dog gets depressed when I go on a trip, last time I had to sneak out while the dog was sleeping.
They know. They always know. 
This is so cute is beautiful
You guys are making me miss my girl even more. Been 9 years since she died

Excuse me I'm just going to go cry in a corner
I feel like my dog would start doing this if she saw this! She hates the suitcases!!
He makes a compelling argument.
I did not come here to cry damnit!
Vacation cancelled. 
I know more than 2 people with a lower IQ than that dog xD
100% would cancel my trip after that. Like ‚Äúsorry kids, we ain‚Äôt going to Disney this year‚Äù. 
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ he wants to fit inside your luggage and come along
When I leave the house my dog sits on a pillow he found somewhere and tries not to keep direct eye contact with me.
Nopenopenopenopenope
aww thanks- made my day
Correction, he didn‚Äôt want his favorite human to go on vacation-
WITHOUT HIM-
"No vacation. Nope. Nope nope nope. No leave. I won't let you". 
Step into my office and we‚Äôll discuss your vacation time.

Edit ‚Äî you** your**
if only we can be with them to wherever we go. 
Handling that baggage better than most airline employees..
Whenever I pack a suitcase, my dog gets sullen and pretends I‚Äôm not even there.
Is this a repost? My heart truly wants to upvote.
Then bring him.
If his mouth wasn't full, I'm sure he would have closed the crate door with the pink thing to finish it. 
That night, his plane crashed into the side of a mountain
Those eyes ain't lying
Such determination breaks ones heart.  If you would take him, it would be all right.
Aww- this so great
Maybe he's planning his version of a vacation. 
Just take him with you. Pets can have passwords too haha
Awwwwwwwwwwww :'(
Remember, everyone,  your dog has *already forgiven you*.  They forgave you before you even "transgressed".   This is something I keep trying to learn from our dogs.



[Dog tax :  [Ramona](https://i.imgur.com/nzMw9EB.jpg)  She was my "SoulDog" and we lost her at 13¬Ω yo a month ago.  Something makes me cry missing her every day still.  At least this one is early in the day so hopefully I'll get through the rest of the day with drier eyes.]
This is why I don't go on vacations lol.
That's a suitcase not a human
my dog gets depressed when I go on a trip, last time I had to sneak out while the dog was sleeping.
I wouldn't be filming, I'd be getting my expensive luggage out of his slobbering mouth.
You're not going anywhere without this. No, sir...
I'm never leaving my dogs again! :-( They would do this too if they were big enough!  ......or eh-hum....smart enough
I mean, that is one bad boi
Sorry, but you just can't go. Obviously it would be animal cruelty. Cancel your trip immediately. Poor guy. /s

Edit:  didn't know about the "/s". Will comply from now on!
Rip my babygirl.... There's nothing like a dog. Always loyal and always loving no matter your looks, or what you did.
This is why I never leave the house :(
Looks like it's a staycation then.

I feel bad for this sweet baby, he lives in a cage when there is a comfy sofa right next to it. Release this angel from it's prison!
Sometimes the people on reddit are incredibly naive. But hey, aT LeASt "DoGgo" iS cUt3 
You better of not went on vacation.
I never will get why people put there dog in a cage. Why even have a dog? I have a rescue dog and the vet on star was going over everything like shots, what kind of food and then told me I should cage train the dog. I looked at her and said then why even have a dog Then? 
Think of it from the dogs perspective, an 8 hour work day to you is a 56 hour absence from your dogs life. So every day you go to work for 1/3 of your day, you‚Äôre really out of your dogs life for like 2+ days at a time. 

So one week away for you is like a month and a half for the dog

Edit: downvote me all you want, guilty people - it won‚Äôt change the facts 
Fat doggo.
It was cute until i realized it was taking it back to its cage. Dont cage your animals fuckers. Your domesticated animals are your captives, thats why they call it captivity. U treat them better than u treat anything and dont put them in fucking cages.
You know what? Fuck it I'm staying home let's cuddle! 
when i try to pack my dog lays in my suitcase. she is not a small doggo but she makes herself fit.
Smart doggo

Edit: mean hoomans
I wonder how long it took this person to train the dog to do this
Dogs are too precious for us humans.

EDIT: Downvotes? Huh. Must've sounded like some PETA nutjob I guess. Ah well.
What did we do to deserve dogs they‚Äôre literally the greatest thing in the world 
We, as a race, don't deserve dogs.
We don't deserve dogs.
We dont deserve doggos
