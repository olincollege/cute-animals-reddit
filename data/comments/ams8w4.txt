/r/Superbowl Sunday
He looks like he's TRIPPING Hard!
I thought owls usually weren't waterproof like other birds to enable them to be quieter? 
Moist owlette = best 
And just in time for Superb Owl Sunday!
Serious question.  Do they like floating in water?  It doesn‚Äôt look thrilled, but I would the first to admit I know absolutely nothing about owls.  
"Hey, Karen! Can you grab me a ***towl***? Get it? Karen?"
This cute owl's response is perfectly in sink.
Those little red strings hanging off its back are its feet in case anyone was struggling with that.

Edit: Ok I was wrong. Those are the *tags* on its feet. [Full video](https://youtu.be/-4INpwaASdU)
Superb Owl.
OP, you the real MVP for the title of this
Owl get clean, owl get fresh, owl gon hunt for his nightly catch 
I don't speak "owlish". Is he happy or not? 
Cat boy! **moist** Owlette! Gecko! PJ Masks!
Best wordplay title of the day no doubt, perfect for superb owl sunday.
Owl trainer/keeper here! 

I hate to be a downer, but **this owl appears to be extremely stressed.** Owls will occasionally bathe in shallow water, but they would *never* willingly choose to float in water they can't stand up in. The reason this owl is floating around like this is because unlike other animals, small owl species usually don't try to escape or fight back if they're scared or uncomfortable. Instead, they instinctively "freeze up" like this, no matter what you do to them. You can pick them up, pet them, even put them in water, but they won't react. To the untrained eye, this behavior can make it look like the owl is 'relaxed,' 'tame,' 'cute,' or 'happy,' but inside they're incredibly frightened and waiting for the stressful experience to end. 

*Please* think twice before upvoting things like this. [Owls should never be pets.](https://www.internationalowlcenter.org/owlsaspets.html)

This made me laugh so unexpectedly hard. In the middle of an otherwise pretty quiet restaurant. I think they're bringing me some crayons to keep me busy.

I am constantly asking for moist owlettes and people keep giving me these stupid wet wipes that have a pleasant lemony scent.

My toddler watches a show called PJ masks. This title had me wondering why no NSFW tag on it.
I can't believe noone posted this yet

Every hotel needs to offer this upon guests arrival if they want my 5 star rating 
I will sleep better tonight knowing they float.
#‚óâ‚ñæ‚óâ
Is the surface of the water a portal to another dimension because there's about 45% of an owl that is just not in that tub.
I literally do not want to read moist owllette ever again
He looks lile one of those lil block flannels that slowly expand once put in water 
Are owls always high on mdma?
Don't get the pun as this is a duck.
That's an odd duck

owl bodies apparently revert to 2d sprites when in water.. probably an oversight by the developers, but understandable that they didnt put an owl in a bath during development
O RLY?
Honestly this just makes the cartoon owl with a monacle make so much more sense 
Just a question. Can you actually keep owls as pets? I see posts with foxes inside, owls, etc. I thought owls were just for the wizards. ;)
What the hell is this Karen?
*Awwlette
It's moistly just hanging out.
Which aisle can I find these in?
I thought that was a photoshopped frog at first lol

Desperately seeking a way out
By it‚Äôs pupils you can see it‚Äôs super stressed out 

He can‚Äôt leave the water because his feet are tied up. 

How people find this cute is beyond me

Turn off the lights and it's a free owl sensory deprivation experience.  
May I interest you in a moist owlet sir?
Leave this bird the fu\*k alone.!
If you know anything about kids shows, you‚Äôd know this could be the title of an XXX-rated parody.
The title is genius.
Where do people get these owls? Is it legal to own them?
Screw it! I am a duck
 he looks like a blob and I want it
