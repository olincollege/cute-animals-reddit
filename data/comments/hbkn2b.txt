Let‚Äôs see if he can do that in about 9 months.
My Golden Retriever gets ticked off if we don't go to bed soon enough. She goes to her crate and howls until we let her in and then we have to be quiet so she can sleep. In the mornings she hates getting up and generally runs right back to bed after I let her out. Its weird.
Lived with a beagle that would camp in front of the refrigerator and had to be moved (while letting me know what he thought about it)like that. Just could never quite put together that he wasn't going to get cheese if I couldn't open the refrigerator.

Dog version of being a little kid, and faking being asleep after a car ride so you get carried to bed
Thats a German Slepard, might also be a noodle mix.

Don‚Äôt you dare go boneless on me Shawn
Ahw when the sheppard becomes the sheep
Watching this makes my back hurt.
This is so funny to me, because all I have to say is ‚Äúkennel‚Äù and my dog dive bombs into it like there‚Äôs no better place on earth lol she loves her kennel.
Can also be used as a broom.
I think it‚Äôs broken. Did you try turning it off and on again?
I don't have a dog (at the moment) and here we mostly let our dogs sleep outside or in the house on their own bed or even our bed depending on the person.Can someone please explain the crate to me? I've seen it used alot on the Internet but I don't understand why.
I‚Äôm a sucker. The pup would be in bed with me.
I‚Äôd go to bed with daddie
That pup is resisting a rest
Why lock him up in a tiny cage?
I have a shepherd who will put herself to bed. She gets annoyed if youre up past 10pm. On the flip side I have a 1 yr old shepherd who WILL NEVER SLEEP!
He‚Äôs so cute. Why would you lock him up
Thats basically my dog too. I have to carry her off to bed every night and every time she lets out a few soft growls.
Why do you lock your dog up at night? Not mad just wondering.
Let him free...
But why do I have to go in the cage, Dad?
I was fine on da floor üôÅ
 Came here for all the ignorant ‚Äúwhy does dog need go in crate derp derp derp‚Äù comments

She's going to be just as stubborn and 4x heavier in a year.

I could prob watch this 400 times and not get tired of it
But dad I don't want to get up!
Ah yes the absolutely moronic crate. Put your dog in a cage so that they feel ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and by safe we mean forcing them to hold their pee because it‚Äôs not convincing for us to take them out.
Why do some people make their dogs sleep in cages..?
Why tf would you put him in a cage?
What's the idea of making your dog sleep in a cage? (Too lazy to Google)
Let him sleep with you.

It increases trust, and what are you going to do while camping!
I don't get why people put dogs in those tiny cages :(
Why would you put your dog in a cage? Thought you guys were all about freedom.
Okay, why do you lock that poor dog in a cage?
Well its already been said if you need a crate to keep your dog from destroying your apartment at night you not training him well enough. All these articles about how its good for your dog are just bullshit. In Germany NOBODY puts their dog in a freaking cage .. and I havent heard of anybody having their dogs destroy furniture. Only when I lived in the US i saw this kinda shit. So many people in the US just have 0 clue how to take care and train their dog and rather put em away. Fucking sad.
(Getting downvoted by these exact US people haha pathetic)
Why do some people  let ther dogs sleep in cage
Never understood why people keep their dog in a cage
Son to dad...why do u lock me up in a cage. Let me sleep on ur bed or at least a nice large cushion on ur floor.

Where I am from, we never put our dogs in a cage for the night. Where is this coming from and whats the purpose if I may ask?

Edit: getting ~~ridiculed~~ downvoted for asking. Thumbs up r/awww
Its probably just me, but I always felt it was kinda cruel to get a dog, and then just lock them up in these stupid cages.
Handsome household!
Ehhh. Cage training a dog to keep in an apartment seems wrong to me.
I wouldn't want to sleep in that hard crate either.
Get that good boy a foam mattress!!
People in the comments don‚Äôt seem to understand why the dog sleeps in a cage, so I‚Äôll explain. There is a thing called crate training. Pretty much, letting the dog know that it‚Äôs crate is it‚Äôs safe space. Dogs like to have their own space if they are annoyed or stressed, so having a crate is actually really good for them. I may be unbearable for us to stay and sleep in a cage, but dogs aren‚Äôt us, and they need a space like that to be away. It‚Äôs also a bonus for the owners because they don‚Äôt have to deal with their puppy tearing up something while they sleep. People saying this is cruel are uninformed on how training a puppy works.

Hilarious and cute!‚ù§Ô∏è
Ohh bless him.
"Can't go to bed dad, got no bones"
The opposite of my dog. He absolutely can't understand why someone should not want to go to bed
This is the human equivalent of being a child and pretending to be asleep at the end of a car journey so you can be carried in!

Keeping a dog in a cage is just cruel

Quick question, do you lock her in? if yes, why?
I feel for dogs who have to be forced to a cage.
I wouldn‚Äôt want to go back into a cage either. Especially one with a towel for a bed.
It's not that he doesn't want to go to bed, he just doesn't want to be in a cage.
But daaad I don't want to be put into a cage.
Why do people in the US lock their dogs in cages? I've seen this all over reddit and it still baffles me. Like, please don't get a dog if you're gonna lock it in a cage wtf
Animals shouldn‚Äôt be kept in cages.
What kind of monster make their puppy sleep in a cage?
It's cruel to put them in a cage. That would be absolutely horrible.
What's so "aww" about putting pet in a cage
One thing I'll never understand is why some people put dogs in cages... 

It feels so... wrong.
Worst kind of dog owner
Cages are such a weird sleeping concept to me. Mine have always slept in bed with us.
Never seen that indoor dogcage other than in American videos. Is that REALLY ethical?!?
I feel bad for dogs who spend every night locked in a small cage
Why do people put their dogs in cages ?
I have a lot of respect for people that crate train their dogs. My dog owns my whole bed.
That's me as a dog
He's just helping you clean the floor
My golden still did this even at a year old. He's 1.5 now and I still do this to get him out of a room lol
Omg someone‚Äôs been on a long walk!!
I have a German Shepard mixed breed.  This video is spot on.
Had a Boston terrier growing up that would turn the lights off when she was ready for bed.

Fake fox tail hanging from the ceiling fan lights' pull chain, after watching me turn the lights off a few times she would leap up and tug the tail to turn it off when she wanted sleepies.
As an owner of a german shepard retriever mix, this is very accurate
We got these small herbal (supposedly calming) biscuits for dogs and made a routine that our now 1 year old springador gets half when he's ready for bed time in his create. We only use those biscuits for night night time. He gets in without being asked now and we never close the door, so he can sleep where he wants and create is not that bad after all...
Thats funny. My 4 month old pit bull has taken over my daughters bean bag. Basically chose it the day we brought him home. I have to literally dump him out of it at bedtime.
It‚Äôs so cute bc he starts moving more as he knows he‚Äôs getting closer to the kennel.

My cocker spaniel is an old man (13) so I have a bedtime of 10:45pm. Every night on the dot he‚Äôll ask to go out to do his business and then he‚Äôll run around and bark at me until I go upstairs with him to my room.
My girl ( a German Shepherd too ) absolutely hated her Cage. She never wanted to go inside and she eventually utterly destroyed the thing. We talked and she agreed to stay in the couch at night

Funny story: she got into a routine. She'd stay with the next person that would go to sleep next just before it was there time. It would be: my father, my mom, my sister and me afterwards. Once she'd be sure they where fast asleep, she would go to the next one on the list. I'd stay awake for a long time on my computer and she would never leave me until 15 minutes after I was in bed

God I miss her :(
Really cute! Thanks.
I don‚Äôt wanna go in a cage 

Ftfy

I don't understand what the Deutscher Akademisher Austauschdienst has anything to do with this post. Nor why the title is mixing English and German.
I am a cat person and this is adorable.
Can someone explain to me why he needs to go into the cage? Is it just because or is it because of what? To be honest I wouldn't want to sleep in a cage at night.
That cat is massive!
Cutest thing I‚Äôve seen this week.
I can't fuckin take it. Holy fuck that was adorable. It was so fucking cute that I'm almost mad. 

Fuck.
Aw this reminds me of our basset/beagle mix. You stand her up and get her moving and then she‚Äôll pass a carpet runner or the dishwasher mat and collapse back down

Reminds me of my German Shepards they really don't like to go to bed
Cmon one more hour
For him, sleep is already unrequited
But its got good plumage
what we didn‚Äôt see was how the dad made a lap around the living room to sweep the floor
Oh my god, I need a puppy so badly.  It's like some kind of dog-owner biological clock.
 Crate just makes you feel better. Your putting your dog in cage. My dog only goes the cage when I‚Äôm gone for more than an hour. Once she learns to leave the plants alone she‚Äôll just chill out in the house.
When you were little and pretend to be asleep so your dad would just carry you and put you to bed.
My dog does the same thing, but when you say time for bed he lays down and gives the begging eyes. Then he drops his weight when you try to pick him up
Why this dog needs to sleep in this crate? Door locked, no water ? Wtf?
Don't want to be mean but that dog looks like one of those costumes furry people wear
Sweet baby!

Damn, that dad can take me to bed anytime
I've done that, passed out and woke up in a cage.
Hahaha soo limp!!
Ahhh the good old cage for your best friend
I have seen so many people who do not put mattresses in the cages. Poor doggies those flors are too hard to sleep the whole night

I wanna be pushed on the floor like that
Omg, cuteness.

Worlds best guard dog :)
GS puppies just might be one of the cutest goddamn things in the universe.
I had 2 beagles that were crate trained and we always kept one out  for 14yrs and sometimes the 2 of them would go and lay down together in it and became a space that if people were over and they felt bothered they could go and be out of the way from people walking around, on , over and everything else and I saw someone say during thunder storms which the one would bring his blanket from where ever it was and go and hang out in the crate and stare at you terrified until it was over you couldn't get him out if you wanted and his sister would sit on the couch and probably think what a baby. (probably used other words you get the point)
my dog looks exactly the same, or did at least. He looks different now but
Civil disobedience pupper.
A bit of lamb lung as a lure and they'll follow you into Hades :)
That is one tired pupper!  Soo cute!  Put me to bed my slave

Edit: just a question, people! Surprised by all the downvotes. Got a good mix of answers though, so thank you to all those people.
Why lock that pup up?
[deleted]
You're a good dad!
Own many dogs, never crated one of them.  Give them toys to chew, food to eat, water to drink, and a place to sleep. Let them go outside in the yard if you have one, take them on walks.  Crating has got to be the most inhumane fad iv seen in all my years.
I've always wondered why Americans keep dogs in cages at night? I've never even seen this in Sweden.
stop locking your dog in cages you evil bastards
It's ok son. Get in the fucking cage.

^(I don't agree with the practice of caging dogs as part of training.)
I swear this American thing of putting dogs inside cages at night is one of the most disgusting and inhumane thing I've ever seen. Fuck all of you who do this shit. 

INB4 "it's to avoid the dog destroying the couch", honestly fuck you. If you need a cage to train a fucking dog you don't deserve a dog. 

Rant over. Now I'll get downvoted by all the 'Muricans that think this shit is normal. Imagine if YOU were to spend hours upon hours every single day inside a cage without even realizing why
Because dogs sleep in packs... my dog snuggles with me all night in my Cali king sized bed.
Dogs are pack animals. That guy is a selfish asshole for caging that dog.
I dont like those types of "beds" looks like a jail fot a dog :(
Can anyone tell me why must the dog put into the cage? Why couldn‚Äôt he just left outside?
That is what you call "dog tired."
I fully expected him to wake up and run out to sleep outside the cage.
I love the gentle care here. That pup is well loved.
He‚Äôs an adorable puppy and looks cute like this but this is also teaching terrible behaviors that will persist after he‚Äôs fully grown and much harder to push lol

not a big fan of caging dogs but I do see why people do it
Be careful with collars and these type of crates. My dogs collar got snagged on the wiring once and nearly died. Luckily I saw it in the middle of it

Why cage him?
Woah a dog in a cage. That's really weird
I wouldnt either if I was locked in a cage for 8+ hours where I can barely fit...
I think he has outgrown his crate and is ready for some trust, just use a goodbye command (have a phrase you always say when leaving him/her so he won't even start anxiety chewing/antics)
This makes me really sad actually. It looks like this dog has crate anxiety and forcing him in definitely isn't the way to crate train.
Does he have to sleep in the cage every night?
I like to raise Cage Free companions.
No one wants to be in a cage.
Do all dogs sleep in crates?
I always get a little bit sad when I see dogs getting put in cages. I know it's necessary for certain breeds and damage prevention, but still. I let my dog under the covers cause she gets scared otherwise, no cage necessary ever. Though she does sometimes take cardboard when we're not watching lol.
Why would you put your dog in a cage at night?
Sexy guy but shitty dog 'bed'. How would he like to sleep on one thin blanket? :(
Not surprised he didn't won't to go bed would u if u was put in a cage n locked in for the night ü§¢ as a pet owner don't believe in putting them in a cage at night don't think it right there part off the family like a child so leaves I asking urself would u put ur kid in a cage at night
Why would you put your dog in a locked cage? He wants to be with mom and dad.this is messed up.smh.
What's it with owners putting their dogs in cages? Buy them a dog bed/basket or put the blankets on the floor.
ITT:  People who think crating a puppy is just *horrible,* but wouldn‚Äôt think twice about putting a baby in a crib. üôÑ
Cute but why‚Äôs the dog sleeping in a cage and not at the foot of your bed??
Bed, prison, same thing I guess.
... And what would have happened if you didn't lock him in a cage? Probably would have peacefully slept there. Why the cage?
Why people cage up their dogs for the night?
no one wants to go to bed when your bed is a cage
Poor boy, why do you keep him in prison?
Somebody do me a favour and explain this option to have cages for the dogs.

What? Having cages for dogs is not a thing in my country. It appears asking _actually_ hurts.
Why t f someone keeps a dog in a cage, don‚Äôt buy a dog you f idiot if you can‚Äôt leave it free roaming in the house, I hate these people and all of you who just look and watch ‚Äòaww‚Äô that a cute caged dog, f morons!
Plot twist: the dog is dead and the guy is insane
I've had dogs most my life, and I've never put them in a cage at night.  
Serious, why do people do this?
I wouldn't want to sleep in a cage either
Your dog is not your child
He wanted foodz but sleepz won üòÉ
It's amazing how they use toddler tricks in attempts at evasion. Getting our current Mal in his crate as a pup ended up with him putting all limbs out to make himself too big to fit through the door. At about six months it wasn't happening anymore because even with three of us we couldn't get the leverage. Little shit figured that out way too easy. He has learned that the technique shown doesn't work because we just grab him by the collar and drag after the first time until he gets up.
What an American thing to cage dogs at home.
Why the fuck do you Americans put dogs in cages? You don‚Äôt deserve em.
I'd bet that poor dog spends most of his day in that cage.  I don't understand why a dog owner would use a cage ever.
All you morons commenting on what‚Äôs the floor made of
Nobody would want to stay in a cage.
some cement head forcing a defenseless animal into a cage. the irony is the dog will be happy to see this piece of shit in the morning. fuck you
If your dog is locked in a cage all night, how is he going to protect you from an intruder? My sheppard sleep by my side every night
I will never understand why Americans (mostly) have a cage for their pet. Fucking weird (and fortunately illegal in Sweden). I want my dog to be free and be able to sleep wherever he feels like.
Hate the crate
This is great
Awww let the little man sleep with ya.

My GSD is 10, and if I push him around like that he thinks it's a major power move and we fight and chase for hours.  So naturally I have been pushing him around the floor most nights for about 9 1/2 years.  Picking him up is what *really* gets him going.  I love my dog.

My corgi still does this after one and a half years
