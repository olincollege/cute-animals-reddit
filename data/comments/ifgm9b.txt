Ultimate “I can’t decide so I’ll have one of everything” moment. Congrats to you both!
Pup in the green collar looks like it's doing it wrong.
I think she ran out of ink.
Fun fact, each puppy could have a different father!
Aww this. I remembered our now 14 year-old black lab. When she gave birth to 11 puppies, they came with 3 colors of them too. We got to keep one for each color and gave out the rest. Such good girls.
What a proud mama :] hope she is doing well
Dang she did do a Lab sampler LOL Super cute ❤️ She looks like a proud mama, congratulations!
I’ll take one off each no questions asked, puts the dogs in the 💼.
Aww, look at the little beanies on those babies. So precious. And mama is gorgeous!
Mama looks like she ran out of toner towards the end
Good catch phrase for the pick all lined up too lol
As a fellow whelping & maternity foster, I always love dog genetics and the variety that can come out of momma.
That smile! What a proud and beautiful mama!
Look at her SMILE! She's an amazing mother. Those puppies are absolutely adorable.
Thanks everyone!! To answer a few questions, there are 3 boys and 5 girls. Mama was surrendered by her “owner” along with several other labs that were being allowed to run free and not being cared for (hence “owner”). Everyone is strong and nursing well and Ellie is being an incredible mom!

She and the babies are available for adoption through the rescue I foster for; if you live in the northeastern US and might be interested, DM me and I can direct you to their adoption process and application.

❤️
Awwweeeee... She's a Beauty, and look at that happy look of Zen on her face.
Fun fact: All female Labradors, no matter their coat color, can have puppies of all three different coat colors.
She love em so much that she got one in each colour!
She’s really milking this photo op.  I hate myself.
I've never seen one of these photos where the mom dog isn't smiling.
A flight of puppers?
I see a lot about green collar baby out back, but light blue collar baby out front gets no love
I think its possible that dogs can have have a litter of puppies with multiple fathers? Not sure if that true but it seems like this might be proof lol
Aww that’s the same litter sampling my girl came from!! Granted, that was 7 years ago..!!
Forget one of each, I want them all! And mama, too.
What's that green one doing....
She looks so proud “look at my colourful babies!”
Green collar = 2020
If it wasnt for the green stripe i wouldnt even know theres one there😅
One on the far left is a lil confused but he got the spirit
She was losing ink while printing
Cute! Variety pack
Awwww. Her puppy printer ran out of ink. Adorable!
Nothing to worry about, that’s the lab normal range!
I love her. She is kindness and joy.
Oh my gosh... a whole gradient of puppies! This is too adorable!
She’s so proud of her family!
These are some very interesting lab results.
I teach high school biology and we use labrador breeding to teach genetics. Some cool, simple concepts at play here.
“My foster mama,” are you being raised by the dog?
Punnett Square Gang 😎
Love how Mama Ellie looks extraordinarily proud and happy. Such a beautiful set!!
Funniest thing is the yellow lab on the far right is actually lighter than the other two which some people call a 'Silver Lab'. This momma has 'em all!
ok be honest you put them like that
Are there right of them or am I missing one?
arent they the cutest?
proud mama!
I honestly thought this was a funky looking spider
Awwwwww....Congrats!!!
Ink run out
Two of them are holding tails. Cute.
So so so adorable! What a beautiful mama and pups!
Happy picture of the day.
Homeboy in green got lose on his way to the mess hall
The printer ran out of ink.

yo wuts the shawty in the back suckin on
Look at how happy the mum looks lol
Man dogs make no sense. How the hell did that dog carry that many babies inside of her?
Did you arrange them by color before taking the picture?
Looks like her ink ran out.  -my girlfriend
I love how you colour coded them
Ran out of toner
We fostered a dog we named Ellie that ended up having 10 babies in a litter! We're pretty sure there were a few different fathers for the group of them.
Aww such a happy momma 🙂
Wow!!! Congratulations mama Ellie!!
The one with the green collar seems to be suckling from an odd place.
Printer toner ran out of ink!
[WARNING]





Printer out of ink. Please refill.
I think little Mr. Green Collar is lost :)
*Please Replace Toner Cartridge.*
Pups' father aptly named Sherwin Williams.
Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate.
Printer ran out of ink.
r/starterpacks
she ran out of ink
The chocolate ones are my favorite cause they're always a specific kind of adorably stupid that the other two colors never quite reach.
When the printer runs out of ink
She ran out of ink.
Taste the rainbow! Beautiful!
Omg I would name them all after types of chocolate and call them my little box of truffles ❤️
reminds me of a Maury Povich show.  those ain't your babies!!
When your printer runs out of ink mid-job.
I have a black lab too and her pups were the same. We now have one of the yellow ones too. Do you know what is better than one lab? Two labs!
I don't understand why they are chocolate labs, yellow labs, and black labs instead of chocolate labs, vanilla labs, and licorice labs.
Best lab results ever!
if it wasn't for the green collar I'd never see the one in back
Your printer looks like it's running out of ink. Congratulations! They're adorable.
she ran out of color
This is so adorable. I remember fostering a Mama Dog long ago. I kept Mama ( RIP i miss her...she pased 5 years after having pups) and still have 2 of her 9 pups. My mom, sister aunt and another aunt have some of the pups from that litter. 10/10 would do again if my house wasnt already full of dogs.
Awww what a happy mama and healthy babies! 


My black lab delivered 6 labs that were also different colors— one white, 2 yellow and 3 black puppets :) interesting how genetics work! 


Hope these babies live long and happy lives 🤍
Perhaps she ran out of toner?
We named the one in the green collar Taint.
Gives me flashbacks to my genetics class
Gimme 1 :o
I love showing these photos to my mum. She enjoys them like I do.
I love her and her little happies so much! What color is the one yellow lab wearing? All collars are visible but purple is in the way of one of the other yellow baby. I gotta know!
Hopefully you had her spayed after this.
Dang she went to every side of the street
Such gorgeous pups id take em all!
Op what kind of dog is that? I have a black lab, walker hound doggo named ellie myself! 

Also very happy for her and you!
Beautiful 😘😘😘
How is this possible?
Wish I could get one.  😍
She decided to go with the variety pack 🤣. This is so cute and adorable 🤗😍😙😁😎.
OH MY GOD SHE’S SO PROUD 😭😍
Awww! Congrats to Ellie and family! Has the slow one learned yet that you can't get milk from the color blue? ;-)
I recently went into a deep dive on the internet looking at Labs and the genetic makeup and probability of colors based on mom and dad. It is actually super interesting and now I really want a chocolate lab.
The chocolate ones with their pink beans!
OMG! so cute. Are you looking for someone to adopt? I'm super interested if you live in Southern California!
So does that mean like the puppies are your brothers and sisters?
So cute!! Congrats!!
Aww our lab Deedee (names after the Rugrats when I was 5) was a black lab that had 13 puppies on Christmas Eve when I was little... they were just like this- this gives me fond memories
aww, I love it! the puppies are so cute.
Green
I’ll take a vanilla cream and a chocolate.
They’re beautiful and she looks so happy... Any chance you’re in New England?
This is absolutely precious. She looks like a sweet momma. Thank you for fostering this sweet girl and her babies.
One of each please.
Are there any available for adoption?
My first (non-family) dog was a black lab who had the whole spectrum of lab puppies. Ellie looks a lot like my Jenna did and that’s really great
god can you imagine if it was normal for humans to have 8 babies at a time
Yes I’ll have to confiscate the puppy’s
I can just hear Marvin Gaye singing “lets get it on” in the background.
Beautiful family. Mom is so happy which only matters ❤️
Some science class will have this on their slides to teach about genetics one day soon I bet
What a good girl! Looks like she is proud of how busy she was!
Lol the last one
I really wish the was one more chocolate pup.
Jsjsjxkkska i want all 😭🥰😍
Nice
I would love to have one of those little mini floofsters
Stooooopppp...they are adorable.  Omg. And she is soooo proud. Keep us updated!
Awwww
Chocolate Labradors are sooo pretty https://google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=chocolate+labrador
I love the one pup stuck in mom's butt area, lol
She looks so darn proud!
I'm happy she got to have her puppies somewhere safe and comfy
Ok where's the 3rd brown pupper. I need to know
Awww, she looks so happy!
The multi color collars are adorable 😍
Proud mama!
how did i get here
That's what she said.
Multi colors collars look's very nice
Omg I want one
She's a full lab analysis kit then.
Cute
Can I have one?
She looks so happy
She started running out of ink halfway through
When the ink is running low...
They are so cute!
>I'm gonna birth, and I'm gonna raise, every. Last. One of them.
Awww
I’m up at the middle of the night and this gave me years of happiness. I need some sleep
The last one on the right side
She was getting around 😜
Printer ran out of color
bitches be ho-in' around
I'll take one of each please.
Look at her beautiful smile. 🤗❣️
I’ll take one
Is her expression more likely to be happiness or stress?
Wow I fostered a black cattle dog named Ellie that had a litter of 11 puppies about a year ago, we named her Ellie because of eleven
I'll take one of each please.
Is there a story here? Is she a regular foster mum?
Where is that last puppy eating from?
She ran out of ink!
Are those the cable management Velcro things used as collars?😂
I wonder what colors does the father dog have
Those pink toe beans tho
I'll take all of them thank you
motherly love
Ill take the light blue. Cute shy lil thang 🥺
A flight of pups
The dog in the green collar said, why is this spicy?
Ink cartridge got low!
Awww I love them! 😍🥺
Or she ran out of toner!
aww man i want the chocolate puppy
How adorable!
Soooo cute I wanna die :>
White baby? How?
Cutest thing I’ve seen in a long time!
The guy in green is at the wrong place?
Looks how cute they're 🥺
Need to change the toner
No wonder why she looks happy.
Omg I love labs
Nice
How is there so much variety in just one litter? I thought they may be of 2 colours - one from each parent.
How does this happen from a genetics standpoint?
So cute I’ve always wanted a lab
The labra-starter pack
Recessive genes are da bomb
It looks like she ran out of ink when the last white puppy came out.
When the printer runs out of ink
Labrador ROYGBIVtreiver
Such a proud mama!
That smile tho
*Mendel entered the chat*
Her color palette choice is awesome
Now that is a pack of antidepressants if ever I saw one! Super adorable. Wish I could adopt one!
Awww
So cute 🥰🥰🥰
Awh cute
I’ve been looking to adopt a lab but I guess COVID they aren’t allowing it?
People who like the fluff, do check out OP’s profile. They’ve been fostering for a while and have so much more r/aww on there. Kudos to them!
This looks like there wasn't enough ink for all the pups
Collect the whole set.
Look at that, such a good girl 🥰
Adorable.
Mum looks so pleased just wait 7 weeks and she will be glad to say im resting now
Awwh she has two of every colour jelly bean with one extra black and a white jelly bean 😭
Daddy must have been a MUTT with a capital M
She looks so happy for a mother! , I dont have a dog but my cat was absolutely exhausted when she had her babies


Good job mama dog!
Absolutely precious! Beautiful mommy. Babies too. Im just in awe. This is such a happy sight to see.
She ran out of ink!
I’m colorblind are there 3 colors here? Black, brown, and yellow? Can’t tell if there’s 2 different light colors. Also, that mama looks TIRED. Tired and HAPPY. ❤️
Does she have any chocolate labs with little white socks? My choccy has a little white patch on her chest and a littler whiter sock on a single paw.

If not, her sample pack had something missing!
Toner ran out.?
I find the chocolate coloured ones are softer and more durpy, the black ones are more energetic and the golden ones are more intelligent. That’s just from observation but it shows that they will have mighty different personalities
I'll take one of each.
Awwww
Can't decide shall I make a "running low on ink"-joke or try to find a compatible  color chart
I love you mom, love you lot because you don't think about colors. have to learn from you.
AWWWW... Beautiful. :)
Pup in the green collar is about to realize he’s not drinking milk
Aww where are you located? I know someone who is looking for a lab
That was so nice of her to foster you. I know it can be ruff, but sometimes you’ve just gotta show some teeth and bark back at them to show them you’re not a pup anymore.
Pantone could literally turn this into “Lab colour chart” 🖤🤎🤍 cuties!!!
omg look how proud she is!
My dog’s name is also Ellie and the last night I dreamt that she has puppies lol
When the toner cartridge starts to run low.
Gorgeous! But mama dog needs to put on some weight.
She’s so pretty!
Where did those white pups come from hmmm?
When the printer runs out of ink. congrats!
Everyone loves Golden Retrievers watching kittens in a basket
Lab sampler pack 😂
Looks like the printer ran out of ink 😄
There is a fox red colour it’s lovely
bqby lwbs are the cutest things on earth
> My foster mama Ellie

So now she's got to look after you *and* the puppies?
I'll take the green one. He seems confused. I can relate.
Make this NSFW mods. Think of the children!
I think mr green over there is gonna be a handful
Sorry I can't hear you over those little pink peets in the middle
Look at how happy she is! They're so cute.
Animals
(Somewhere far away in a grave)

Punnett: I must take notes!
Doggos are so wonderful they even give you the full spectrum of baby doggos to love. :P
Aww all the little babies 🥰🥰🥰🥰
What would one need to do to adopt one of those choco pups?
Snack pack pups.
This is this cutest thing I’ve seen all year
all those feetsies.
Dogs are cool.
I really want a chocolate lab.  Someday. Mostly to use one of the many chocolate names
Looks like skin color opinions on emojis
Omg precious 🥰😍🤩
“I contain multitudes!”
Octopuppy
She looks so happy in the picture!
She must be a proud momma
Good Girl!!
I need a brown one!!!
awwww😍
OMG!  Puppy breath!  

Well done mama! Beautiful family!
OMG she looks so happy!
No need to sample all of them. Chocolate’s the best
**Napoleon**, you know we can't afford the **fun pack**!
Embark one of those puppies! Don’t do wisdom panel though. They aren’t nearly as accurate. 

Beautiful dogs. Thank you for fostering.
I didn't know dogs were allowed to take in children into foster care. Are you happy with a dog as your mum?
She's so photogenic!
Ran out of ink on the last one.
They are sooooo cute!  I’d take/adopt one. My cocker needs company during quarantine cuz he follows me EVERYWHERE. :)
Uh oh, printer is running out of ink again.
awwwww
:D
Sadly color does not affect their flavor
Wow that's so cute! Why she's so comfortable while the baby drinking the mik? My dog feels so uncomfortable when her puppies drinking her milk
Awesome, she looks like a good mother
Hope all the pups are getting fed
She looks tired but proud
Look at the happy pups and a super happy mama. Adorable.
Just make sure they register at the catch-a-ride
I knew a dog like that once
I think one might not be on a nipple haha
Aww, what a good pic. That sweet momma dog looks so happy with her pups 😇
The ink pack ran out, just needs replacing. Those are some good puppers though, much love
printer mama ran out of ink!
I've heard that animals dont smile.  That dog looks so happy.  Theres a line in the novel steppenwolf how he describes an animals eyes.  Does anyone know if animals smile?
Keep posting pictures of them!!
My heart ❤️❤️❤️❤️is smiling
Look how proud she is! Goodest mamma!
Looks like the pup on the end of a white lab. They're prone to being deaf! I've got one myself. She's a good girl, just hard to call back when she runs off.
She musta been huge. Do you have a pregnancy pic?

Also, can I have one of the babies?
Happy momma
Lots of adorable lab's puppies
She's a doggo full of surprise...
The dogs are slowly running out of printer ink when you look at them from left to right
Not lab
Awww look at her happy face :)
Seems she's low on ink.
A sampler pack of lab sweetness!
Good Work mama Ellie and foster OP!
run out of toner
You think that as human/apes evolved from other mammals that we started having smaller litters first or fewer nipples first? I feel like it was the former. We probably started having fewer babies in one go because changes in our mobility led to us having abdomens/pelvises that couldn't support large litters.

Or if larger litters are is a newer evolutionary trait, what came first? Extra babies or extra nipples? In that case, I feel like maybe it was the latter. Like extra nipples was a fortuitous mutation that lead to being able to keep more babies alive.
I used to actually raise lab puppies and to get all 3 colors in one litter is pretty rare. Assuming they are 100% lab it is possible but does not happen often. The black lab technically carries all three colors since to get a black lab you either need a chocolate and yellow breeding pair or parents that carry the color in their backgrounds to get black. My guess would be that either she was bred to a yellow male that carries chocolate or there is more than one dad to the litter. Either way though getting all 3 colors in 1 litter does not happen very often. Lol
An eight pack combo!
Anti-racism dog
Wow! That's magic! Just kept pulling em out, I'll bet.

Almost like you have a Labracadabrador.
When the printer runs out of ink
That green puppy is eating dat ass
There's gonna be a affair joke here
She looks so happy.
Congrats!! She looks so proud!!
Please, once the puppies are weaned, please have this sweet Poochie spayed.
Many puppies and dogs await forever loving homes in shelters.  Please please never let Poochies breed, 
Especially for Profit.  🐝🧡💦🌲🏡
Seems like greencollar here is still getting the hang of nursing. Brings a whole new meaning to brown nosing.
Awww! I normally hate seeing dogs breeding but she’s a foster and you gave her a nice safe place to have her Bubs. And she looks so happy! So now I’m sad she’ll have to say bye to them after all she’s gone through! Oh the feelings!

I hope you keep Mom at least?! And one of her Bubs. 

Or all.

For now, that weirdo in Moms bum is my happy maker 🤣
Started running low on ink
"the printer ran out of ink"
Nah man the printer ran out of ink
When the printer runs out of ink in the middle of a 30 page print job
Running out of ink, but I still need to print this paper...
OH MY GOSH!!! WOW. Such a proud momma. Well done. I just adopted a black lab/hound puppy and he is the best.
The one with the green collar got the short end of the stick.  Right up mammas butt.
This is so adorable! But how did it happen?
Your running out of printer ink.
that dog looks so happy.
(B)lack (L)abs (M)atter!
she ran out of black ink as she gave birth
Omg!! They’re so freaking cute awhhh
Dudleys! I have a dudley yellow lab. I love him so much. I am humbled to share the world with him.
You should not ha e been assigned a dog as a foster parent. She’s cute though, but still, that just irresponsible.
How is that possible?
You should post this to r/sploot, u/DisgruntledPlebian
Ombré puppies!
she looks so pleased with her new pups ❤️
So that's 24k sucking on Ellie?
the dog is not racist yeah!!!!
The copyer is breaking
My cousin had her baby yesterday too. Kinda weird to think that her kid and these doggies were born the same day
Your foster mom was a dog?
[removed]
Are they really all labs, or are they “lab mixes?”
She's a tramp!
Would you put a human newborn in a collar?
what's the story behind this? did several dogs fuck her or was it some anomaly with the birth causing them to be different?
[deleted]
[deleted]
The black puppy on the end looks like they are sucking on her ass.
now rip her kids away from her and sell them to someone!
That's NOT a chicken nugget back there
Cute pups but there is a 0% chance they were born yesterday. I'd say at least a couple weeks old..
Further proving black women created life lol.
That dog for the streets
I see 

Its all un coloured order
Hmm george Floyd pt2.??
That is super cute. Please though, stop using collars. Unless those were flee collars that is. Get some harnesses for them. If indeed you need them.
