I don‚Äôt know he seems very impressed. 
You idiot, now you're married to the cat!  
Cats respond to meows, not vows.
Cat looks shocked, he's like, "Really, Gary?  I had no idea you felt this way about me.  I'm going to need a moment to process this..."
He might be annoyed if you forgot to ask for his blessing... he‚Äôs just refusing to acknowledge the occasion.

Congrats and have fun today.  It will go fast.  
Congrats! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do great with the vows!
The cat looks like it is giving you solemn approval.
By the size of your cats eyes, I would say you‚Äôre promising too much.
"Really Jim? You're going with that?"
Remember that it's too late to get stressed about anything.  The most important thing now is for you and your partner to have a good time, and make wonderful memories.  Let go of the little things, and try to enjoy yourselves :)

&nbsp;

And congrats!
Congratulations! Oh and definitely, the vows are fine. It's the cat that's the problem. Go ahead and just send the cat to me and I'll take that inconvenience off your hands. üòª
Say it in Meowish. 
I‚Äôm getting married today too! Hope your day is full of love and I wish you life long happiness!
He‚Äôs still hurt you didn‚Äôt ask him to be best floof. 
He is paying attention to you, I don't think you will get a better deal with another cat.
Aww, but look how attentive he is!
Did you speak to him in English or Cat?
I'm getting married today, too! Plus it's my birthday. Congrats to you!!
I hope you have time to take a moment by yourselves today. My husband and I didn‚Äôt see each other until our 4:30 ceremony, and it was non stop until after our sunset photos around 9. We took 10 minutes to talk and soak it all in. That was the first time we realized we were actually married. It was my favorite 10 minutes of the whole day. Congratulations!
He looks like this is the first time you told him you would get married and he might feel betrayed now that he has to share his human.
Try reading them to the coffee table. You'll probably get a more emotive response. 
Unplug him and plug him back in. That should do the trick.
Im sure your vows were purrfect, good luck out there :)
I would go with both options, just to be safe you know.
But looks like cat is ready to say yes. 
I‚Äôm getting married today too. Though about doing this with the the puppers but I thought I would have about the same reaction as talking to the wall so I chose the wall. 
Try saying your vows in meows
'Sensitive cat' - thats what you call a dog.
By the looks, he may be still in the suprise phase
I got married today too! 

All the best for your special day!
I‚Äôm getting married today too! Congrats! 
You misunderstand the cat.

That look means "wut? I'll have a maid AND a butler now?"


Your cat is clearly a robot.  I mean, look at the stuff still on that coffee table!
congratulations! I hope you have a perfect day. :)
The real Awwwww is in the title
The cat looks flattered
Congratulations on your wedding day! Your vows will be beautiful no matter what because of what they are, but I‚Äôm sure your cat approves!
I'm impressed that you got married to your cat. Kudos!
Apparently he's trying to comprehend everything that just transpired before him too. 

Jokes aside, have a blissful marriage! üòä
I think you fucked up. If I read the rules correctly, you're now married to your cat. Sorry.
Cat was probably raised not to cry in front of people. I wouldn‚Äôt take it personally. Monitor the cat from a distance and see if he sheds a tear when he thinks no one is looking. 
New vows. He‚Äôs a very good boy and can‚Äôt be wrong
Congrats!

I'm getting married today too. No cat to evaluate my vows, but I bet just like me you wrote from the heart.

LPT: DO NOT visit the venue while they're setting things up. 

It'll be great and you guys be very happy ok?

Cheers.
Just get a more sensitive cat, i bet the vows are written great. Good luck for today
Did the cat meow his vows back? 
Concatulations!
She's listening. I think that's the best you can do with a cat. 

Why are you trying to make your beloved cry? She's got to take PICTURES you know! ;-) 

Have a good day!
You got the cat to pay attention the whole time? Sounds like ya done good!
he seems all busted up on the inside .
Hey, I‚Äôm traveling to my cousin‚Äôs wedding right now.
I think your cat is in shock that you just threw this marriage on him. 
He's crying internally he just doesn't wanna work you up with his tears before the main event
That's obviously terror.  Cheerfully interested terror...
Your blinds are crooked. 
Yes
He might be in shock. It's a big commitment and you kind dropped it on him out of nowhere. 
Cat had just assumed that all those vows to him were already in force. He looks a bit surprised that you suddenly felt the need to voice them.
Your cat seems very happy to have been wed to you
More sensitive cat = dog. But if it‚Äôs today then do you have the time?
your cat is simply in awe.
The problem is that he‚Äôs a cat.. try a dog next time
To me it looks like the cats think ‚ÄúGod dammit Jim, I knew you could do it, go out there and get em‚Äù
It's to late to rewrite the vows... Get a new cat

 Congratulations! Have a wonderful day ü§ó. 
Congratulations! I hope it‚Äôs a beautiful marriage 
Hey I'm going to a wedding today
Get a fish.

Edit: I was trying to be funny and for got to say have a great wedding and a wonderful life with your significant other!
He looks very impressed 
He looks impressed, I'd say you did a good job! 

Enjoy your wedding!
How dare you even suggest replacing that perfect boy!!
Redheads are a touch customer
Your blinds are uneven. 
My son is also getting married today and I do not recognize this cat. Should I worry?
Wow what a completely unnecessary title for a simple picture of a cat. Without the title this picture wouldve gotten 7 upvotes 
This is one of those pictures where the title gets 20k upvotes, but the picture in a vacuum is completely average.
Cat: The f**k he just said? 
Imagine getting on Reddit and posting a picture of your cat  on what is supposed to be one of the most important days of your life in hopes of getting karma
He looks all chalked up 
So hilarious! Love it! He looks like he might have "cold feet" by the look on his face lol
Yes to both. Congrats. Give your partner everything you can, it‚Äôs worth it!
Nah, your marriage will go great. You have the cats blessing now. 
What you should do, is post pictures of the wedding because congratulations dude!
I think they're purrfect because I started crying immediately!  : ) 
CONGRATULATIONS! 
He paid attention, though. You should be flattered that a cat paid attention to something you said.
Congratulations!! I think the cat just looks stunned at your creativity, that‚Äôs all it is üòâ
I think the cat doesn't give a damn about anything. But congrats
If Simon Cowell was a cat
He's crying on the inside.


And congratulations!
Aww. You‚Äôll be a beautiful bride!
He's looking at you. I'd consider that a win. Congrats on the wedding! 
More sensitive cat, and i will take him off your hands :)
Meowme me
Definitely rewrite the vows. 
I want a cat now. That cat looks like the perfect cat, the definition of cat is written all over his face. Those paws and his size and body ratio is such a pleasant sight to be sought. Not sure if he's smirking or smiling, but that a damn great looking cat! 
He looks content, I'd keep the cat. 
I think you should change your vows to a series of varied meowing
"That's nice, human slave. Go fetch me a can of tuna 'spouse.'"
Your vows are probably fine and your cat is functioning properly. Loyalty and commitment are not a part of the feline makeup.
He looks pretty engaged to me. 
Engaged. Get it?! 
He's just got commitment issues. Try it on a dog and they'll love you even if they don't understand what you're saying or know who you are or where you came from.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve got no idea what he‚Äôs doing, but he hasn‚Äôt fed me yet.‚Äù
He‚Äôs like no no no you‚Äôre my servant and I‚Äôm the king. I can‚Äôt get married.  
Want sensitivity?  Get a dog.
Maybe the cats just not that into you man. 
Cat seals the deal with lasagna, not vows.
Polite cat
Cats don't have feelings. Seems normal. 
Rewrite the cat and get more sensitive vows.
It‚Äôs me or the girl 
Good luck finding a more sensitive cat. Unless it's about them, they don't care. 
Well there is your mistake.  

You practiced on a ginger kitty.

No soul = no feels.



There's nothing "aww" about this. It uses a shit story with a below average picture of a cat to garner upvotes. I'd rather not see stuff like this, hopefully the mods agree. 
It's fine. Your cat seems very impressed and attentive to you reading your vows.

Also congrats on the marriage. 
He is probably pissed off about your crooked blinds.
Remember... cats are assholes üòÇüòâ

Congratulations on your wedding today! I wish you and your soon-to-be spouse many years of happiness and good health.
Its literally just a random picture of a cat looking at the person taking the picture of it. 

That plus the wedding (awww!!1) related caption (whose assertions are totally unverifiable in the image) makes this post the animal equivalent of "my 3 year old said INSERT PHILOSOPHICAL STATEMENT HERE" Twitter posts, and to me suggests it may be both fake, and gay.
Congratulations!
He looks very proud! Congrats OP
he looks very surprised, probably thinks you whacked your head really hard.
You've got his attention.....they must be good!!!
No vows, just exchange cats.
Time to get a newer cat model, I've heard the Meowdel 2.0 has stronger emotions.
He looks exactly like my cat Lucky. Only Lucky is fat.
Hes thinking.."why are you doing this?"
Das a clean house yo
Are you located in Atlanta, and getting married at nonis by chance? 
Get a new Cat and I take care of that Cutie 
Hey, my sister's getting married today too! Must be how if you turn today's date sideways it's ‚àû-‚àû-‚àû (the dashes are ones)
If only i could find a guy this normal
He's choking them back. Don't let the poker face fool you. Good luck!
Write the vows in feline blood, to show how ferocious you are about your commitment.
Hey I'm getting married today too! Congrats!
The cat is impressed because she's still looking at you, and keeping the attention of a cat is extremely difficult so well done on the vows ;)
Dude.  I didn‚Äôt know things were getting that serious... 
Cats are arsholes... Also, i think you just married your cat....
Your problem isn‚Äôt that your vows aren‚Äôt emotional enough. It‚Äôs that your cat is busy planning world domination and doesn‚Äôt have the time or empathy to care about your big day.
He is just wondering what reward he will get for having to listen to you.
I showed my husband this and he said, "He's just speechless"


So I think you're good!
Your cat looks like he's in love. Vows must be good.
He‚Äôs doing his best you can‚Äôt replace him 
That cat knows you love him more.
I suggest may be you should rewrite it In a sensitive way.. .  
Fool, cats care not for the emotional toils of humans
Congratulations... But your first task should be straightening those blinds. 
Rewrite the vows.  Orange cats are the most loving sensitive cats.  If you had done the vows right, he'd be all over you hugging and crying for your love.
I think the cats purrfect
Re-write of course. 
Bad news, you just married your cat.
Get a dog

Get a dog, it will cry and probably even throw up for you. 
So, after your vows, did you at least let him practice his meows? 
I love how cats love to be talked to!  A lot of people don't realize that they really respond to that direct attention.  Congrats on the adorable kitty and the wedding OP!
Pack a Cliff Bar in your suit! You probably wont be able to enjoy any of the food you ordered. Best tip I've ever gotten!
Was the cat invited to the wedding?  I‚Äôd be mad too if I had to listen to vows but wasn‚Äôt invited üòÇ
Your cat looks like a proud parent
New vows. He‚Äôs a very good boy and can‚Äôt be wrong
Rewrite the cat
I'm getting married today too! Hope your day is fantastic
You should just get more cats. Cats are cheaper than humans. 
U have an orange tabby. He and all of them are selfish assholes. Good luck
Hey im getting married in a few hours too.  Have fun mate its supposed to be a special day or something
Your cat seems like it‚Äôs seen some shit, just by you reading some vows. Poor cat. Lol
Kill the cat for food.  Wives are expensive.
Congrats on your marriage! Hope your wedding kicks ass
He looks like he wants to marry you after those vows. 
The cat was like "I don't do"
I dont meow.
Get a dog! :D 
‚ÄúI meow pronounce you husband and wife.‚Äù
There are no sensitive cats. The cat not leaving was as high as praise for cats go. You're fine. 

(good luck on the big day mate)
I'm sure they're purrfect.
Don‚Äôt get married. The cat clearly doesn‚Äôt approve.
This is going to sound sarcastic but I assure you it is not. You‚Äôre going to be a good parent.
I love this ü§£ü§£ü§£
Rewrite the cat.
If he didn‚Äôt leave the room and didn‚Äôt fall asleep. Thats a high mark from a cat! 
Those eyes look shooketh. I'm sure you did just fine.
‚ÄúLarry, what are you doing. This is a mistake. Feed me.‚Äù
Look at that face. That cat is ~~cleared~~ clearly moved
A more sensitive cat = a dog.

Yes, get a dog. :D 

CONGRATS by the way! Exciting day!
Maybe.  But also clean up that death trap of cables. 
he looks like a proud parent, just happy for you.
Rewrite. Totally. But just change the name to the cat's name ;)

If the cat stayed throughout the whole vows, you're fine
 Cat's expression is priceless 
I've never seen a cat look so attentive, I'd say he's impressed. 
There are no sensitive cats!

He does seem to be paying attention, so that‚Äôs good..
He doesn't care he's thinking where is my fucking food asshole.
"Why you telling me you'll always take care of me? Servants are supposed to do that"
He seems attentive and cats don't cry so you're probably fine
Sensitive cat is an oxymoron.
Update tomorrow with your husband/wife holding the cat!
His tail is curled! I'd say he's keeping the tears back like a stoic man but will be bawling like a baby the minute you leave. Congratulations on your big day!!! Wish your little family a happy life :)
He‚Äôs not happy about sharing you
He's just waiting for you to disappear behind the sheet (of paper) like he saw on YouTube. 
Cat is flattered but wonders if you‚Äôve lost your minds. Congrats btw
Nice couch, I have that same one.
No,  no,  the look the cat is giving is clearly one indicating his interest. He likes what you've said,  but in true cat style, he is waiting for more... "yes, yes.  I hear you and concur.  Please,  continue..."
The faces of everyone in your wedding party when you turn to your betrothed and say, ‚ÄúMeow meow meow, meow meow meow meow, meow meow meow, meow meow meow meow meow meow!‚Äù
I hope your wedding went well!!
I thought my cat was big.. 
How did the wedding go?
Cat is just shocked his competition is moving in and he wasn't consulted on this. 

Have a great day! 
He just seems very surprised and wowed. 
Option 3. Marry the cat.
Looks like the cat is thinking "Are you sure you want to do this?".
Cat‚Äôs jelly
Got married July 19, 1990 at 2 pm at our local courthouse. I guess it stuck pretty good. It is a helluva ride, but worth it overall. Congrats. Hope you enjoy as much as I have. Long life to you both.
My fiancee practiced his speech for proposal to our cat eighth months ago.... She still hasn't given him an answer
Haha this made me laugh big time
Your cat listened & you were practicing
she looks pretty surprised so i think you‚Äôre doin pretty good 
Congratulations bro. Welcome to hell nah I‚Äôm just kidding
He looks interested and has seemed to listen very well. Good listener. Not good enough vows. Rewrite it.
Clearly the cat is offering suggestions
I think the cat is crying inside... cats never cry!
Good luck with your marriage üëçüèª
Rewrite cat.  Get more sensitive vows.
He‚Äôs practicing his poker face for the honeymoon
I think you should post this question on Quora.
I listened to words can I has scratches now?
It's broken take it back and ask for a replacement or gift card üòÑ
"You're going to say that? WOW!"
Keep the vows and keep the cat all cats can show no emotion or hes wondering why you used him
You should get a dog. It would‚Äôve balled. 
Looks like he is proud of you
"Uhhh, GleeUnit... what are you trying to tell me...???"
Cats are inherently cereal killers. No worries! I‚Äôm sure they are great vows! Please ignore the kitties unemotional nature.
Rewrite, cat knows best 
There is a such thing as a sensitive cat? A dog would probably show you love and affection from the second you said your first word
So happy for you üë∏
*cat.exe has stopped working*
Maybe u should find a spouse for her/him..
I feel like he has a really sweet and attentive body language I think he loves that you were telling him a story
Neither. Get a dog
you should learn to spend a single fucking day off of reddit.
Get a dog
Get a dog
He looks confused.  Does he know it's just practice?  I think he believes he's a married man now
I‚Äôd get a dog
Get a dog
No more Xbox for you!
You'll be great! Cats are like vulcans, they rarely show emotions. Congratulations and have a wonderful day!
Yeah, a more sensitive cat is called a dog. 
Congrats, get a dog
Get a dog. 
Save your vows. Frame them and read them again on your one year anniversary. First year is the paper anniversary. :)
Say goodbye to Xbox
Buy a Dog.. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Congratulations!
Theres still time to run OP
Calm down there chadwick
Cats are villains. He couldn't show you a soft side, so he waited until you left the room to weep.
You should probably stop browsing Reddit and get ready for your marriage 
Get a dog
Get a dog. 
>or get a more sensitive cat

A dog. You mean a dog.
Your vows may have lacked a sufficient olfactory component.
I think this here, is a normie looking for attention by posting some irrelevant and pointless shit
Meowiage?
Just don‚Äôt marry the cat and I think you‚Äôre fine.
Maybe work on your delivery first.  Cats are harder to crack than people, so keep trying!
Looks likes he is entranced, so I would say you did just fine. Have an amazing day!
Can‚Äôt commit to a cat how can you commit to a woman?!
Congratulations! I hope you have a wonderful day! 
He sat and listened. Great vows!
Okay but what‚Äôs your favorite Xbox game 
"A more sensitive cat" does not compute.
Orange kitty!
Neither one.

Just talk to kitty more often. He/she will open up.
He‚Äôs totally going to tell on you to your fianc√©/fianc√©e!
Did you kiss?
This reminds me of the Garfield strips where they removed Garfield's thought bubbles. (Later variations remove Garfield altogether.)
Aww! Good luck! Hope this is a day to remember for the rest of your life :)
He‚Äôs so handsome your very lucky.
She's gonna be pissed when she finds out you were just practicing and y'all aren't actually married now.
WHY ARE YOU GETTING THAT CATS HOPES UP?
I would love to speak vows to my dogs. However I rescued them from MX. I need a translator. 
I think you should sell the Xbox and buy a PS4 üí™üò†üí™
What you really need is a cat that speaks English. This cat seems confused.
Get rid of the cat, he doesn't deserve you!
Hes saying that its Perrrrr-fect
At least the cat looks impressed.
Congrats!
Good luck and congrats! Got married last Saturday, try to pause some times and take it all in, they day will end so fast but with a lot of great memories. 
Good Luck with the wedding :) 
"Hmmm...I'm impressed"
Congratulations! 
Your cat is doing a very good job of keeping it in and not crying so you should reward them with lots of stroking and treats.
cats looking at you like: "GleeUnit will there be cake after ?" 
Isn't that a "WTF?" expression? You may want to redo the vows.
My thoughts are that you need to add some brighter colors to your place.... 
what a handsome cat!
That cat looks like a less chubby version of our cat Simba.
Ditched the cat
Say them LOUDER!!!
Congrats! Hope all goes well. It's my brother's wedding today too!
It looks terrified at the thought of being married to you.


You're on the right track.
Nah, he‚Äôs just disappointed you didn‚Äôt order a cake.
[Love the picture but what‚Äôs happening with those wires? ](https://imgur.com/gallery/dUm23OJ) 
You may have actually won him over.
Be thankful he bothered to stay in place.
"You're going with that?... really? I mean, you didn't even say 'I wish we were cats so we could spend 9 lives  together" 
He looks so confused, like "Karen, really youre just springing this on me? Who is this guy does he have an enemy cat? Do you know anything about him? Is he gonna take all my food and cuddles? I already hate him"
Never get rid of your little schmoopy!
He looks like hes not ready for that type of commitment
Did you also post in r/FortniteBR? Because that couch looks familiar. If so, what does your cat think of your fortnite play?
Please frame this picture and your description..it not only is adorable but will be a great memory to have!! Congrats!!
Get a dog, they get emotional every time you say something directly to them. :)
Kitty looks ready to run out the back church door.
Wow that‚Äôs strange..I practiced my vows last night and our living rooms look very similar. I have a PS4 though and my cat would cry if I read her my vows.
Looks like your cat may not forever hold his peace. 
Congratulations! May you have a long long healthy happy life together with awesome cat and spouse 
This oughtn't to suprise anyone. An owner ritually disemboweling themself is likely to provoke the average cat to little more than mild disinterest.
XBox?! People still play that thing?
Congratulations.
This cat looks very similar to my cat 
The fact that the cat is even paying attention to you when you are talking says a lot about how good what you saying is. 
Good luck !!!
The cat isn't the one you're marrying, so I'm sure you'll get a different, better response. Maybe the cat is silently approving, lol. Good luck!
Your cat looks like he wants to hear *more* vows
congrats OP!!
Congrats!
I honestly don't believe you're getting married at all and this is just a picture of a cat. 

But look how attentive he is! He's like, "I am cat, apex predator and nonstop murder machine, but you are my human and I support you. Come here for forehead bonks."

Congratulations!
Happy Wedding Day! 
He said rewrite  it
‚ÄúI do **not** feel the same way.‚Äù 
Just remember to say the right name!
Needs more tuna

Like, at the end?

No I mean in my bowl
Rt ctccx
Beautiful cat and have a happy wedding day!
Cat is saying, ‚Äúwtf, I‚Äôm not good enough for ya?‚Äù  

Congrats on finding the right person!
Hooman, can I has some of da cake pls
Rewrite your meows!
Yes.
Good way to say "im getting married give me upvotes please!" Nice try
Congratulations though!!!!
Don't worry, cats are great but they're also insensitive assholes most of the time xD

Source: have had 2 cats
I think that cat was worried about the honeymoon. He may have witnessed what goes on in the bedroom. 
You should straighten that blind. I‚Äôm dying over here. 
C. Cancel marriage and live a happy life
He looks pretty interested... Or tramatized. Maybe its too much love for him or hes afraid of commitment.
Xbox
You should probably stop practicing your vows and start playing xbox because those days are about over. 
Kitty don't even care. Typical kitty.

Have a beautiful day!
Both...
Cat has look like:  *"this all had better not affect the frequency you clean my box."*
I too have an orange tabby. He is very sweet and sensitive.... when he wants to be. 
Maybe you don't have enough sparkle catnip mice attached to your head?
Honestly has a look of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre gonna say that???‚Äù
He looks like a Steve
Maybe it was your delivery.... not the vows and not the cat?!  ü§óüê± 
Congrats on your marriage!  May happiness and love always be bountiful!
Turn off phone. Pick up Xbox controller play fortnight for the rest of the day.
Best wishes for a long and happy meowage.
Well, at least looks like is listening... Try taking his paws.
Get 2 cats so they can curl into a ball and clean eclachother so it's cuter
Congratulations!  
Happy Marriage!
It takes an intelligent mind to come up with a caption this good. 
Get married first
What a cute cat :)
His eyes don't converge... I don't think he even knows where he is.
Remember that it's too late to get stressed about anything. The most important thing now is for you and your partner to have a good time, and make wonderful memories. Let go of the little things, and try to enjoy yourselves Bring him catnip everyday and take care of his fur. I'm sure he will bring you some dead rats as well. Accept them and eat them with care. Saying you'll eat them later gives off a bad image. You must eat them raw in front of him.

¬†

And congrats!


That cat knows you love him more
He‚Äôs still bitter about not getting an invite to the wedding. And then you disturbed his peaceful morning. You‚Äôre the bad guy here!
He don't want to listen to wedding vows he wants FOOD
he seems too be listening atleast xD
What a blatant bullshit story for karma 
Put that cat in a tux and make it walk down the aisle
Give him a can of tuna and go about your day.

Cats are so cavalier..you won‚Äôt get a response out of any of them
Get a dog. The dog woulda been happy as fuck!!!
He looks so betrayed thinking he was the only special one in your life ;)
Well, at least you get his attention and looks impressed... Try taking his paws this time.
He obviously doesn‚Äôt look impressed. 
Remember to eat.
Plot twist, you just proposed to your cat. She has accepted you.
He's just trying to figure out whats wrong with the staff
cat so cute
He zoned out after you said " Webster's dictionary defines wedding as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch..."
I think its just how your saying them, get the cat to say your vows back to you ill bet you'll cry.
Of course the cat didn't cry. The cats reaction is just like "...I know"
"Say what meow? You gotta be kitten me right meow!" Shakes cute orange head "I do care, I'm all choked up right meow!" 
Rewrite em mate. Obviously didn't hit the mark 
The cat looks a bit gobsmacked- you may want to take out the offensive parts. 
"More sensitive cat"
CONGRATULATIONS!

He's just too proud of you to cry!
Get a less sensitive wife
The cat seems a bit uncomfortable in this situation.
Just get rid of the cat.
Or face the fact that you're an adult now
Get a dog
Have the cat say the vows. Clearly the best option. 
I would like to point out a critical element that you seem to have overlooked.  Cat.
Cat has this look like, "umm where is your wife going to be living?" 
Asshole cat.... typical! 
Your cat looks like he doesn't believe in marriage, as an institution. He loves you and respects your decisions, but is torn on telling you how he feels about this. He loves you, he just doesn't love everything you do. 
Get rid of him. You're gonna lose everything in the divorce anyway. Good luck. Lol
A dog would‚Äôve reacted to the vows....trash the cat, you deserve better.
More sensitive vows, rewrite your cat. 
Put this picture in your wedding album! 

I think he is just wondering when there will be cake!!
Your cat is moved beyond tears and desperately trying to keep his composure, cats struggle to process deep emotions much like the English.
This cat‚Äôs face straight up says ‚Äúuhhh, are you sure you‚Äôre telling this to the right person?‚Äù
Redo your vows, the cat knows best.
What a cat sensitivities measured in?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Jerry. I don‚Äôt... I didn‚Äôt realize you felt that way. This is so embarrassing... I. I just don‚Äôt feel the same. I hope I didn‚Äôt lead you on.  Please still feed me.‚Äù
Nah, it takes work, you can't just get a new husband, That is also a furry
Keep the cat, rewrite the vows. The cat will be there for you long after the wife is gone.
Just call off the wedding.  That's what I'd do.  As it turns out, I have lots of pets and no wife.  That could be a consideration as well.
What a handsome, attentive face! This post made my morning :)


Congrats on having such an adorable cat  


Oh, and your wedding, too. But mostly the cat. 
Your cat is fucking adorable. And I am NOT a cat person, either; Would be for this cat.
I'm getting married today too! Congratulations!
Congrats!!!
Congratulations on the nuptuals! My cat is of the same stock, and he too is an insensitive jerk.


But you might want to right some different vows, just to be sure.
Throw the cat away
We have very similar cats! Mine is named Neil. 
You should have at least dressed him up in a little tux! 
Your kitty looks very proud of you. Congratulations and have a wonderful day!
Cats are historically stoic. Go with your gut. Do keep an eye on kitty. If he disappears quietly and tries to keep to himself, he may be more impacted than you realize and need a hug or a good pet.

Also, congratulations! I am sure you all will make a beautiful family! üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
First come, first served. Better get that cat marriage annulled. Hope you got a prenump, cats are real jerks.
Time to play more xbox
I‚Äôm pretty good at crying if you‚Äôd like a professional
Garrett?
I guess crying isn‚Äôt for pussies.... 
Option C: get a dog. Dog would have wagged his/her tail, jumped up grinning to praise you then circled you madly. Congrats. 
Meow-age. Meow-age is whut bwings is tagever todway. Meow-age, that bwessed awangemend.
Its a natural born killer not a sucker for romcoms
What you should do is get another cat. Once the romance starts and it's his turn to get married, he'll have to practice his vows on you, and you'll get to act just as unimpressed. 
"T..t..this is a bit sudden human. I don't know what to say.. i guess.. meow?"
Listen man I see one xbox controller, a couch, and a cat in this picture. Are you willing to give up a life of gaming on a couch with a cat for what, love? Pffff. 
;) 
It's not your fault that he's a ROBOT!
Congratulations! üçæ
I'm not buying this.

We all know cat people are introverts and don't venture outside. We just stay inside with our cats.

What? Is that only me? 

Anywhoo, he is so precious. <3  I think he was actually impressed beyond words. He seems pretty enthralled..for a cat.
There‚Äôs no way I could have remembered vows, mainly because of the hangover 
He has the same face as my friend whenever he has to deal with emotions.

Congratulations!
Nah both of you are great. Contrats!
Congrats!!!
Congratulations üéâüçæüéäüéà 
Rewrite the cat
Congrats! I'm getting married today as well.
What you need to do, is buy a Play Station.
say the vows in meows, not stupid human english.  Then you'll probably get an emotive lick or nod.
aw he's doing a very good job paying attention! you can tell he's intrigued haha
Who are you and why did you steal my cat



*or maybe they just look alike .-.*
He looks as if you're going to screw up your wedding vows, might as well try pleasing him then trying..
The cat us giving you a lesson. Just so you will be prepared for the reaction regardless X)
You should say goodbye to that Xbox controller 
Cat is just mad he‚Äôs gotta share. Congratulations and best wishes for a lifetime of happiness 
I give it 12 months until divorce
Congrats! The cat took it for granted that you would take care of him till death separates you apart, hence the lack of tears. ;-)
This is so sad! Alexa, play Desmeowcito
Kill the cat ditch the wife live life free
New cat
You should run dude...as far and as fast as you can. Change your address, and maybe even your name. You still have some time to protect yourself!!!!
I think he‚Äôs confused because you haven‚Äôt proposed yet 
Rewrite the vows.  With a little more feline
Try again ... and keep going till the butterflies move up from your stomach and into your heart, but don't let them choke you off at the throat :)
Goodluck dude!
He's as sympathetic as he can be for a cat. Accept it. Congrats on your big day! 
Totally jealous that you got to spend your wedding morning with your cat.
But did you put a ring on it?!
Forget the vows, bail on the wedding, and avoid the inevitable third ring of marriage.....the SUFFER-RING!
Congratulations! ^_^ 
Rewrite the damn vows
You should get a dog instead 
Friendzoned again
Congratulations 
Well hes not gay but he is trying to be supportive.
There is no such thing as a "more sensitive cat".
Roll again
Marry the cat. Trust me.
Funny anecdote about cat (with cat tax paid) while simultaneously showing off your vows. We‚Äôve hit peak performance Reddit. 
His expression says, "I'm not ready for this level of commitment."
Get a dog
Cat seems speechless to me, I'd say that's a good thing, unless they are spectacularly bad.
Tomorrow will be my one year anniversary. If I have any advice, it's check this post again tomorrow. Today is going to fly by so fast, and if it's anything like my wedding day, it'll be the best day of your life. Drink it in as much as you can, because it's over too quickly. 
Yes
You gotta rewrite the cat and get more sensitive vows.
He is clearly in shock and never knew you felt that way about him.
I can tell that cat loves you so much. You can just see it in his eyes. It's so sweet. Congrats on your wedding.
Did you remember to meow your vows?
Congratulations!! Looks like your husband will have to explain a lot to his cat-in-law
You should straighten out those blinds please. 
Caet is looking at hooman. That should be enough for hooman. Very rewarding.
...or He‚Äôs just been made speechless! Your ~~vows~~ meows are just that good!
Dont worry. hes just shocked. he didnt know you went like that. POSSIBLE DRAMA??? To be continues...
It simply means ur stupid lolü§£üòÇ
‚ÄúQuite frankly, human, I don‚Äôt give a damn‚Äù
He looks like he's getting cold feet. 
He's probully really touched :) Congrats !! 
Cat looks so shocked
Get a dog
Wait a minute, this looks exactly like my cat that ran away OP.
The cat has the heart of stone, but maybe its like a father...crying on the inside...but stonefaced outside.
If your vows were about biscuits or kibble there would be excitement.
Cat -‚ÄúYou want to marry.. me?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe talkin‚Äô bout practice?!‚Äù
‚ÄúLess vows. More meows‚Äù
I just think he's shocked at how beautiful they were.
Both
Yes.
He looks very polite though
Yes
Or get a cat friend for him/her
#**CONGRATULATIONS!!!**

And I think your wee Puma is showing a great interest in your vows! Can we ask much more from our felines than "great interest"? I'd suggest not.  Your cat is proud of you and hopes to gain another ~~sucker~~ soul to scare the dickens out of at 3am, to convince that "OP forgot to feed me!! Am *starving* ", and another warm body to trip, ignore, and rule over! 
The cats like ‚ÄúNot this again...‚Äù
Keep the cat and get rid of the soon to be husband. Problem solved.
Dilated pupils means he's happy 
Congratulations dog, first day of the rest of your life. 
I am biased. I say get a pupper. 

I harbor no ill will toward our feline friends, I am allergic to them though. 


Just don‚Äôt get mad at your friend if he/she gets laid by one of the bridesmaids/groomsmen. 
I too am set to wed today! 3.5 hours away ÓÅó. Congratulations!
Marry the cat and get a more sensitive woman
Eat the cat, and add a description of the taste to your vows. 
Call off the wedding!
He‚Äôs mad because you‚Äôre making caturday all about you. Rude. 
Your cat looks so gorgeus!!
Get a dog
He might still in shock like "Wow, that escalates quickly".
Did you pay your respects?
Ha ha ha
Was this before or after he ate? I found my cat was always more receptive on a full stomach. Also, my wife is the same way! Congrats, I wish you many happy years together... with your wife...not the cat. Or both, whatever. Good luck!
Did you sign a prenup 
Rewrite!
Just feed the cat.
Congratulations! I hope you have a long and happy marriage! 
Congrats! May you both have a long and happy life together. üò∏
Know how I know you have a cat?  Your blinds are bent up.
From the cat's point of view, he already owns you. 
I think you're good. Your cat looks very happy. Your going to have a long happy marriage.
Keep the vows, ditch the cat
A lot of people are getting married today must be the 81818 because my little half sister is too
Rude. He was totally paying attention. Looks like he‚Äôs about to give you constructive criticism. 
I'm not the kind of guy to find things adorable but this post sure is! 
But his tail is slightly elevated... 
Haha well someone‚Äôs in a good mood. Can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like to wake up on your wedding day.
Getting married today as well hope the rain has stayed away from you as well. Good luck brother!
Doesn‚Äôt matter the cat. You‚Äôll always be nothing to them. 
I don't think his sensitivity is the problem. I bet he's thinking to himself, "Yo. I'm *not* the *one* you should be *telling this to*".

Mazel tov!
That's one polite boi
Handwritten vows are more personal. And also makes a great Keepsake to keep in your wedding album.
I don‚Äôt get why this is in this sub. It‚Äôs just a picture of a cat, and the cat doesn‚Äôt care. Nothing awww about it 
I love your cat, and I‚Äôm sure your cows are perfect. Remember to have fun today and really only worry about you and your spouse having a good time! Don‚Äôt sweat the small stuff, it‚Äôll all be a funny memory in the end. Congratulations!!
Hopefully the person you're going to marry fixes those blinds.
I don't think your cat wants you to go through with it honestly. It's almost like he knows something.
Run fast and far
That cat looks mildly startled
Meowage! Meowage is wha bwings us togethaa todai!
Dude I'm getting married today too. Palindrome wedding buddies!
Congrats! My ex boyfriend and one of my closest, dearest friends is also getting married today. Right now, actually. He also has apathetic pets. Jokes aside, have a wonderful day and best wishes to you both! Don't forget to take mental snapshots. :) 
If this was /r/relationships or any of the dating subs they would say its time to euthanize the cat. 
Congratulations! Cat's can be so difficult to please! Just go through with the wedding and hope for the best!
It's a cat...
Anything for attention.
Congrats :-)
Practice your vows on us and if we cry then the cat is a stone cold killer
Congrats! (On the marriage today). I'm getting married next week and wish I had a fuzzy creature to practice vows on. I wouldn't take his lack of crying personally. I'm sure he's just trying to stay strong for you. 

Your post reminded me I need to write my vows. Thanks. Getting on that now. 
Your cat looks like a hooman i know
Try using google translate?
You need doge.
Are you serious?? Can you not see the emotion on that face?! 
Update his software. 
That cat‚Äôs just like ‚ÄúWTF dude?!?‚Äù
I think he looks mighty impressed. 
My cat gives me that look when I'm trying to fit into last years clothes. 
Your cat now has two slaves 
I‚Äôm getting married in a week and this was the push I needed to write mine. Thanks for the kick in the butt, and congratulations! 
He‚Äôs smiling! He‚Äôs so proud that he‚Äôs raised you from someone who picks up his poop, to someone who can pick up his poop and have help from another hooman too
More sensitive cat = dog üòÇ
You‚Äôre now married to your cat. Congratulations!
Cats generally dont like to show there feelings. In sure he's happy about it deep inside. congratulations on your big day.
Nah...just play some Xbox with him.
> "OK. Lemme just stop you right there, Karen. My bowl is empty"
Add something about knowing she was the one when you could finally lick your own balls in front of her. The cat will identify with that.
Neither. Buy more sensitive vows and rewrite your cat instead. 
Get a dog
r/catsareassholes, don't worry about it. 
If you can find one that speaks English let me know.
He looks very interested...
If you wanted a sensitive pet you shouldnt have gotten a cat. 
I don‚Äôt know but what I do know, is that I‚Äôm jealous of your blinds. I only see 2 slightly bent. My cat has destroyed all but one set.
Sensitivity training for the cat and happy honeymoon to both of ya!
LOL, look at the innocent cat. It did not know what are you doing!
A guy who was single with a cat...hmmm? Sensitive type?
Congratulations!!!
GIBS KARMA NOW
Drown cat. Leave town. 
Did you put a ring on his finger?
Best. Post. Title. Ever 
Why not both?
this is a picture of a cat in an apartment.

r/notinteresting
He didn‚Äôt run, swipe at you, or shit on your dress.  For a cat, that‚Äôs ‚Äúmoved beyond words‚Äù.
Congratulations and that cats face cracks me up, in a positiv way
He‚Äôs like shit... Did I just get married? She‚Äôs kidding.. right?!......
Sensitive

Cat

Pick one
Man, I think your cat is broken. He's overflowing with joy...
No cat is like that! Not one!!

Other than that, congratz buddy!
Neither, both are perfect! Congratulations!
Congratulations my internet friend on tying the knot; wish you all the best. Also cute cat.
üòÇüòÇthis made me laugh! Congratulations on your wedding. 
Nah, you stunned your cat, seems to be sensitive plenty to me bruh.
You should get a dog üêï 
New vows...kitty is too gorgeous to replace. 
Congrats. And your cat is just in awwwwe
Don‚Äôt get married it‚Äôs a tarp
Seems like your cat giving full attention
Did you wear gown while saying?
This is what I‚Äôd imagine what Garfield looks like in real life.
Cat is disappointed you waited until the day-of to write your vows 
Dude, your cat is there for you, but not like that. Put him in charge of the after party and you'll remember why you made him your best man.
He sees through your bullshit. You'll probably be cheating on him soon.
No need to write new vows..kitty is just shocked and will be ok once he actually grasps the fact that you are bringing another person home. His home! He thought he was your one true love. Kitty will be ok. And congratulations on your  wedding!!!!!
Looks exactly like my cat, all orange cats look the same 
You should get a more sensitive cat... I'll be glad to take that one off your hands :3
My bet is on the cat being a Finn
I think this is very funny.
Definitely an emotional cat... looks speechless to me.
He is obviously jealous. 
Please tell me the cat is in the wedding. 
Can I just say how beautiful he is and what great taste you have üòç
Try to get a more sensitive vows and rewrite your cat... wait a minute, that can't be correct.
Did you get that couch from Macy's furniture?
O_O
I love the expression on his face
I mean... cats aren‚Äôt very sensitive anyway, so...
Practice? pshh, I made up my vows on the spot. 
Rewrite the vows, if the cat doesn‚Äôt cry you‚Äôre not doing it right.
Congrats!!!! Such a cute kitty!
Awww that's too cute and funny! But set that all aside!!! Congratulations!!! 
Grats! The cat says the same in meows I'm sure.
Call off the wedding.  Cats know about these things.
Probably meow the vows to him. We have to be sensitive to the fact that English is not his first language and...  he doesn‚Äôt give a shit to learn the language. 
No, your cats fine. Probably shocked you play fortnite on Xbox instead of PS4....
Jk, this is a private subject and it just says to go that you shouldn't listen to internet trolls.
You should rewrite your vows in cat language. 
I think you're married already 
Share it with Reddit!
Gorgeous kitty! Orange cats are the best üòª
He looks like he doesn‚Äôt know where this is all coming from. Don‚Äôt be too forward with him op lol 
Top lad
Get a new cat I'll take this broken one.
Your cat is obviously suspicious. 
Sounds like you need to rewrite your cat 
I like when cats pose like that and look very serious. 
Marry cat. Then cat cries when you read the vowels. Problem solved.
No, he looks very polite
Just marry the cat.
Why does this have so many upvotes?
He looks thoroughly engaged!
On a side note, I like that coffee table!
He‚Äôs pissed. You needed to get his permission via offering. No he‚Äôs picked up one more useless life form. 
Congratulations I hope everything goes well and that you two are very happy together 
He's freaking out internally. 
Yo ass better get some better vows or yall finna get a no
By the look on that face I'm kind of wondering if it's maybe both. 
Fire the cat.
OMG your kitty and my kitty look so much alike. Except Bob has ‚Äúswirl‚Äù patterns on his side. Same expression too! Good luck on your special day.
Yes
neither I can tell you nailed it ! you will do great
Yes.
Definitely a 2nd feline opinion....
Congrats! And good luck finding a sensitive cat.
