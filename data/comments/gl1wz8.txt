Get 10 more and you'll have a brand new pool in no time.
That’s the most enthusiastic shovel I’ve ever seen.
This made me smile a lot lol
I would like to hire the dog part time
Put the destructive tendecys to good use lol
r/dogswithjobs
Once you turn it on its hard to find the off switch again
Haha, if I got my dog to do this, I would find that plant re-dug up every day for the next 6 months.
That's the best/cutest shovel ever!!
Rare gardener pupper
What are the running costs
Dog, probably:  "Make up your danged mind, willya?"
[deleted]
A bit messy but more than makes up for it with enthusiasm
Im always thankfull for help
Why are they better at it than we are then their palms are smaller?
What a cutie pie!!!!
A helping paw!
No stop! Only dig!
He’s helping! AWWWWWWWWW
Attention green thumbs: why did he tear the bottom roots off that plant?
Dogs are the best people.
Your pup/shovel is just so adorable!!!! 🐶💙💙💙
Shovel boi
I love the "Thank you" always thank the workers \^.\^
Imagine being a dog who loves to dig and having that be discouraged until finally, after all these years, YOUR DAY HAS COME.

She looks so enthusiastic about helping
I've done this to break up packed snow. Shovel enough to spike a tennis ball into the pile... Lab breaks it down in no time.
What an enthusiastic worker! Hard to find in this economy!
r/PetsareAmazing
Nothing can make a dog as happy as having a sense of purpose to their family
That guy's hair and beard combo is cool as fuck.
over under he digs it up
Scoop Dog
Ok good, good, that's it! Thank you!

Doggo: No stop, only dig.
**I swear that looks like Brett Farve teaching the doggo gardening tricks...**
This is a bad idea. I did the same thing with my dog and now she thinks all the gardens are her sandboxes and she digs up all the plants
This is my Golden boy, but he doesn’t listen as well when it’s time to STOP digging - he helped me plant my rosebush and tomato plants with great enthusiasm.
Somewhere a Diglett is feeling insecure
Awe she’s so cute. I wish my dog was like that. She always tries to bite my ankles tho.
Oh my gosh, this is like, a wholesome life hack.
You should make a page dedicated to her helping you garden/lawn work
You’re like: okay okay that’s enough 
She’s like: no no we haev to make sure it’s... you know deep enough for the plaent
I wish I could feel a fraction of that intense enthusiasm.
r/gardening should see this.
r/dogswithjobs
hands-free shovel, but definitely paws-on <3
"Dig here....wait stop stop please stop"
This is cute and all until you come outside the next day to find he dug them all back up
* Dig dig dig dig dig.. dig dig.
* Ok I stop dig
* Ready to dig .. Ready to dig.. ready to dig
* Repeat
* Profit
This is awesome, sometimes the best way to curb a negative behaviour in a dog is to teach it as a command. It gives them a time and place, teaching “speak” is a great thing to help with barky hounds too.

Edit: best
The dog looked superhappy to help out
I wonder if teaching him to dig holes in the garden is a good idea...
He's cute and all but that's basically animal labor
The idea that the dog presumably thinks they're helping their human hunt is absolutely adorable.
Yeah, gardeners these days are so lazy.
Good dawg!!!
Doggo like "No bury, only dig!" at the end there.
Haha that's awesome, how long did it take you to train her to do that?
10/10 shovel
Such a good helper
Yeah but now he’s gotta go search for the dirt to put it back
What good helper!
Pupper living her best life
She's so happy!! Just like *shieeeeet* you WANT me to dig? Mf bet.
Why is she digging for rocks??
But will she pull weeds?
Bring in a husky if you want to plant a tree.
Aww honey trying to help 🤗
this reminded me of that mink man
The Earth puppyer
Lavender is going to die in that soil.
And if you need to dig under a fence, get a tortoise.
Oh man that's the cutest helper. I love how he/she watches so intently waiting for their next turn 😊
So sweet!
What a fabulous helper.
Teamwork makes the dream work
What a good girl 💕
I could watch an hour of this.
Extremely good boy.
What are you doing!  Filling the hole that pupper just lovingly dominated into the ground!
I need him on my gardening crew!
That's it! 

BUT I CAN DIG SO MUCH DEEPER. SNIFFLES. ERR.
Who’s a good boy?
Goos puppers
This seems like such a good way to keep them entertained while you're doing a job; my sister's dog will just try to play fetch non-stop whatever you're trying to do. He was so pleased with himself when he trained me to load the dryer one-handed, so I had the other hand spare for throwing his ball.
Doggo's like "I was born for this, baby"
It's always better to have an enthusiastic worker.
i read it as new hands. free shovel. and then was very confused.
This dog is actually living the dream!
What a good boi
I love how he/she is so attentive.
This is the best thing I've seen in a looooong time. Watching her help with the garden made me genuinely happy ;D

Thank you and please post more of her ❤️
Blessed post.
I help more now, yes?
Careful what you ask for. Once dog-shovel starts, Dog-shovel can’t be stopped!
i want to watch like a 10 minute longer video of this
DOGS are going GREEN
Dog: "I can't reverse shovel. human forgive pls : ("
Showed this to my wife, who's a teacher. She was so pleased that the owner had an asset-based attitude with his dog--seeing how to turn activities they already enjoy from destructive to productive.
Kept reading it as, “New hands, free shovel” and had to watch it again to actually see the video I missed while I was figuring it out
What a good helper!
Great dedication to his job
[deleted]
"Hooman say I dig. I DIG GOOD!!!"
Doggy used dig.
It’s super effective!
I hope to be able to get one of those hands free shovels soon!
so cute
Truly adorable! This made my day!
hell yeah i have like 6 dogs. and i hate my neighbors. now all i need is a few alligators and 100,000 gallons of murky water

I wish my dog could dig like this. He doesn't use his paws. He just uses his nose so it gets all grazed.
I'm not a dog person, I'm a cat person but this made me smile

What a good boy (or girl)
yous are gettins ways outta hands..s..es
I dig good?
Last weekend my dog was "helping" me dig out spaces for the patio blocks. Perhaps I should train him to actually dig in command. Give it a real purpose
u/vredditdownloader
Another reason to get a dog. They are truly multi-purpose.
The secret to gardening...get a helper pup
This is soooo cuts, thanks for sharing
u/vredditshare
Lol such sweet enthusiasm!
“Wait! Why are you putting the dirt back?!”
Awesome! That’s what we need to teach our dog! Do you have holes everywhere in your yard or does your dog just does it on command?
Oh my goodness I have a doppelgänger to your pup!! What kind of pup is she? Mine is adopted and I am mindblown because they look identical...same size and everything.
I had to share this with my family. I swear you are my fathers long lost twin
/u/vredditshare
I hope that doggie is being paid a minimum of 7.5 treats an hour and gets full scratchies.
Huh digging graves will be lot easier with dogs...
Hell yeah, and with the right control that pup will know to never dig up existing plants but only dirt patches. Y’know incase his excitement does get the better of him. He looks super attentive! Dogs LOVE jobs! Thanks OP

marketers, hire me :\^)
I used to have chickens and my neighbour had a rotty that loved to dig. I'd periodically ask to borrow him so he could dig holes in my yard to unearth worms for my chickens. In exchange he'd get to go home with a fresh egg in his mouth. It was a good partnership.
I dig it.
I was so impressed to watch my dog bury something in the yard last week.  He dug a small hole, put the remnant of his bully stick in it, and then totally covered it back over.  Today, you'd have to know it was there to find it (other than the bully stick tree growing.  j/k).  

If I was a gardener I'd totally put him to work!  He buried something else today.  No idea what, but he came in with a dirty nose and smelling like earth.
I love seeing the little quirks people share with their pets.
It’s a really great shovel, it’s just stuck on the highest setting and you can’t change it :(

Would still recommend 10/10
The dog labor union should take actions on underage dog labor.
Dog looks disappointed at how short it was.
Yes! My dog helps dig out the carrots every year and never scratches the carrots!
"now we dig it back up right!?"
r/AnimalsBeingBros
How long until that puppy digs them up and he’s back to square 1?
I love that he said “thank you”
Thats gonna backfire.
I like how he thanks the dog. I just love when people say thank you and I’m sorry to pets even though it makes no difference to them
I
Used “dig” and “stop dig” with my lab. She was very helpful when beachcombing and metal detecting.
That’s a good way to get those plants mysteriously dug back up in a few weeks.
My dad's daschund used to dig in the garden for him. Her favorite thing was harvesting potatoes. Sometimes a month or two early.
This is good until the shovels unsupervised
I used to have my dog do this all the time. I would just point to a spot and go "dig, dig dig". She'd make a new hole in no time 😍
Isn’t he just going to think it’s okay to dig up the garden now?
Yeah and he's gonna tear up that whole garden when you turn your back lol
Aww puppy wants to help too much. Too cute.
r/dogswithjobs
I was actually doing gardening today, and I thought of using my golden retriever for the same thing, but then I looked at him lazily swatting at a tennis ball a foot away from him and I thought maybe not
I wish I had a dog and a backyard 😣
That dog looks SO INTERESTED in what's happening!
He's totally going to come back later and dig all that shit back up
One way to teach your dog to fuck up your garden when your not around.
Oh that’s a dangerous game to play! Those plants are absolutely getting dug up the second he turns his back.
Now go!
Now stop!
True teamwork
Guy just wants to put a plant in the garden and the dog is going for the earth’s core.
Keen boye😇
My friend trains hunting dogs. He always says “dogs WANT a job, they want a task to do”. 

You can see it in this dogs face. 

Good boy.
Teamwork makes the dream work.
[Dachshunds help, too. ](https://youtu.be/aapmBJuudDc)
I love this
this needs to go in the dogs with jobs subreddit.
Goto dial down the power setting a bit
Trivago guy?
I Hope that dog got some darn good treat afterwards.
I'm helping. 😀
This is great! My pup used to love helping me dig out weeds in the backyard. She would go a little overboard and dig too deep. Trying to get to her stop was hit or miss lol
!remindme 10h
She such a good girl!!
I got my dogs to do that.  Problem was they wouldn't stop
‘You need dig? I halp’
...But, I’m so excited to help!
everytime I see something like this, I always one step further to buying pet
I feel like this is playing with fire.
Those plants are gonners when he turns his back...
Ok, for real, this is an actually excellent way to channel this kind of destructive behavior, they probably have _way_ more fun when their destructive behavior gets turned into a game with their dude.
You know that dog is going back later to dig that whole thing up, right?
How long before the dog does more digging in that plant area because it now thinks its okay lol?
This seems like it could lead to bad habits. Cute though.
siri. dig a hole.
Yeah until you leave the dog alone for 10 minutes and he digs the plants back up lol
I cant wait for the dog to dig up everything that's just been planted. 

Only a matter of time! He knows that's where you dig now haha
He's probably gonna dig those up later.
Wait till the dog digs up the plants later.
Mine dug up so much of our grass we just fenced that bit off and started a vegetable patch. She might have been preparing the Doomsday bunker, I should have let her finish.
hes been waiting for that moment hahah
Guess who’s gonna be surprised when the whole flower bed gets dug up one day
Well thats a good boy
P-P-P-puy Power
Our dog would help us dig up our sweet potatoes just like that. It was a highlight every year.
Heckin good helper!
She’s gonna dig that up as soon as you leave isn’t she?
Aww he’s so eager to help!
Didn't say paw free
My dogs do this too! They’ll dig on command literally anywhere I tap my toes and say “dig!”
/u/vredditdownloader
I get it now. All the holes I have in my yard from my puppers is really her telling me to plant something there.
Then when you’re not home he’ll be kind enough to dig them back up for you!!
It's been said "you can't find good help these days".  Not true!
The off button doesn't seem that sensitive!
She looks like my pup!
I love this sooo much
That dog was human before
That's one fuzzy shovel. I'd almost call the good boy a fuzzovel but Fuzzovel would make a perfect sludge metal band name.
Planting buddy!! Yeeeeesssss!!
Reminds me of one of the neighbor's at my uncle's cottage. He had a Yorkshire terrier that he'd trained to demolish stumps. He'd cut down a tree, point that little guy at the stump, come back like an hour a later and there'd be like 2 feet of hole all the way around the stump. He'd just cut the roots around it and lift it out of the ground.
u/vredditshare
He’s soooo happy to be helping.  This does not ultimately end well, lol.
Good boy
Hopefully he doesn't dig it back up.
*sneeze*
"Are you sure it's deep enough?"

How useful is that. 🤔

My dog didn't start digging until he was older. We could not get him to stop once he figured it out.
yeah, not a great idea to encourage digging in the backyard....
He is going to dig them up ...I  guarantee it.
That’s gonna backfire....but it IS cute!
Shes pretry go
They’re teaching their dog it’s ok to dig in their garden. Not a good idea.

My old retreiver would dig up anything he could, gopher burrows, pipelines, whatever. Point, say dig and he would do it, biting and clawing the dirt. He was very handy!

But...will she dig them up later is the real question...lol

Do you need a hand?
That pup dug up every one of those plants 30 minutes later.  Guaranteed.

Omg, he’s fabulous!  What a helpful boy!
Such a good puppers!!
Looks like a real smart girl helping you out there!
My dog dug up a tree after I planted it... she then 're dug it up, and after I threw it away because it was dead, kept digging the same hole every time I try to fill it.

I now have hole in my back yard that is apparently gonna be there forever
And, he even says "thank you" to his dog! Awww!!

All fun and games until he learns it’s okay to dig in the garden lol
They always love helping. Or at least being involved. 🥰

I think this might go both ways.   If not random holes in the yard, then possibly digging up plants when you look away.

Dog after you try to put the dirt back:

That Was Fun!!! I'll dig it up and we can do it again!!

My mom taught our labrador to dig when she put a shovel in the ground. He stopped when she lifted it. He was very helpful, especially when my dad had left a shovel out on the lawn. Yep, he dug everything he learned.
Dog: Ah yes. Now lets talk money.

Human: \*Insert cricket sound effect here\*
You should spread the roots out before planting.
Just wait til that dog takes a shift digging without supervision. I got a feeling he is gonna undo all that work. “But master, you enjoyed my digging last time!”
The antidog.
That's freaking awesome. The dog is like, "I am helping! Yes! Tell me where to dig! I will dig the hole!"
What aisle of the gardening section is this shovel located in? Looking to pick one up.
lil guy’s going to dig these plants all right back up as soon as he’s left unattended

Stupid dog made a mess all over the concrete, this is why humans will always be the superior species. Quality work can only be achieved by the human race, other half breed species are sloppy and bound to fail. Some animals are just born to be owned while the rest of us are born to be their masters.
Congratulations! You just taught your dog it's okay to dig up your garden! lol
Cute?, yes. Efficient?, unfortunately no.
I just want him to dig a deep  hole now 🥺
