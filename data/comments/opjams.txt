My dog also loves to sneeze in my face
This reminds me of our family dog who passed away in May. He wasn't happy until he was basically in your clothes.
Dogs are the best and the worst workout partners.
Oh my goodness that shoulder snuggle!! And the double stomp of the paw ü•≤
Every dog knows that the only reasons humans ever get down on the floor is to snuggle or play
Does anyone have these things? How are they? The push up things, not the puppy. I have one of those already
The dog is adorable,  the guy is adorable,  this whole vid is just adorable
Lol I thought cats were the worst about this, but obviously not.
What breed is that?
I just melted into a puddle on the floor
Dad, stop. stop. stop. stop. I said stop! I need to tell you something.

...

....

 I love you.
My dog does this! And I just want peace.......to her there is no peace just love
I like how the dog stretches like " well, time to fuk up his workout"
I love this dog, I follow the IG her dad makes about her and she‚Äôs so damn cute
Love it! And the UConn Huskies towel in the bkgd!
This is Chris evans and dodger all over again
Omg the little grunts she makes is so effing cute
‚ÄúOoohh you came down HERE to see me?!‚Äù
If human does doggy equivalent of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs play‚Äù bows repeatedly, there can be no other expected outcome. Ain‚Äôt their fault that working out greatly resembles doggy play bows.
My pup does this same thing. As annoying as it is it's also very sweet.
This is why dogs aren't allowed in gyms.

You just can't be productive with those animals around, with them walking up to you and being all cute and making you feel warm inside.

...

***This is also why i never go to Gyms.***
Anytime my wife and I do any yoga or workouts that involve a mat/ us being on the ground, our cats do this.
Here's the link to the guy's YouTube channel with many more videos of him and his dog.
https://youtube.com/channel/UC62it6o5SiOSQ7JkOc5BtpQ
My dog and young kids do this. I put a gate up, but it didn't make me any more productive. They all just stand there whining, making me feel guilty. YOU NO LOVE US?
My Corgi does this when I attempt yoga in the house. It's too calm and "zen" for her. Not enough Chaos. She lays on my mat. She has taught the cat to also lay on my mat. So, I'll do an extended pose and just hit fur at the top of my mat always.

Loveable jerks.
r/petthedamndog
Your dog is a grunter too! I have a corgi that does that. I swear they are using it to vocalize.
Videos like this have me smiling ear to ear. Dogs are so pure.
The snuffling üò≠
stop this nonsense hooman!
r/PetTheDamnDog
Dogs are the best.
This is just one reason I'm reluctant to do floor exercises: My cat gets up in my face. 

The other reason is I'm middle aged and not inclined to haul myself up from the floor.
> *"If you didn't want to play, why did you make so many play bows?"*
such an aww moment, such a sweet dog ü•∞
Shes precious
Only a dog could do this and you'd still end up laughing and loving it even more
I hope they appreciate it while they can.  My girl passed away earlier this year and these videos just gut me. I miss her.
/r/petthedamndog
I will take the whole set, bathe them and send them to my quarters
Where‚Äôs Bobandy?
Dogs dont understand exercise - ‚Äúhey why are you doing that? Why do t we play?‚Äù
See this is why I don't work out because of my dog. Yep that's it.
Man I love dogs
When you are on the floor, you belong to me!
If it's on the ground IT BELONGS TO THE HOUND. 




This includes you.
Yup. Is okay. Still love.
I too have the urge to cuddle with cute dudes I see working out
That dog seems like it has a little husky in it
I have a slightly fused wrist so I can only do fist pushups, I need one of these.
That is the sweetest pup in the world. I can't get enough! lol
I love how he just wants to be involved.
Look at the smile on that doge‚Äôs face
Pay attention to me
My dogs do this ALL the time. I can never do yoga anymore üòÇ
Why not just close the door when you work out?
Not a specialist, but I kinda feel like the dog is concerned by the dude working out.
He's standing by, just close enough to limit the movement without stopping him totally.
This is exactly the same reaction and delicacy from  dogs trained for epileptic people.
Could have been a great partner from his beginning!
This dog love him purely that's heartwarming .
Dogs are the WORST personal trainers. ZERO understanding of personal space.
What a sweet, loving pupper! <3
I love when they do this :)
What a sweetie
She loves her dad! Lol
I love when dogs are super lovey like this <3
Chelsea!!!
This is why you lock the door or put a child gate up. The boy will want your undivided attention.
Haha my heeler does that same whining thing, just a bit higher pitched (usually when he‚Äôs excited/nervous about something on our walks, which is frequent üôÉ)
this is my dog hahaha anytime I get on the ground she assumes I‚Äôm there for her
"LOVE ME DAD"
Hey that looks snd acts exactly like my dog. Carolina Dog (American dingo)?
imagine being loved
Hey man, what a great dog you got there.
Eyyyyy UCONN
That dog got the love for you, dude.
But I luvs you daddyz
What breed of dog is that
Aww, she loves her daddy, and is obviously so loved back.
What breed of dog is that?
My cat always comes to investigate and get right in my face when I do push-ups
One day I'll find someone to love me the way that dog loves her dad
Me: exercising

My Cat: *I must lay on you*, NOW!!!!
If you think about it, Dogs are pretty great of them getting in your face and bugging you makes you laugh.
People - you work out so much...why aren't you losing weight 

Dog - fuck this guys weight loss, I like him round
Time for a walk dad.  Please stop exercising indoors and let‚Äôs go outside‚Ä¶please!
This is why I'm 300 lbs overweight with 12 dogs.
Emotional Support Dog trained to keep you from exercising! It can be upsetting after all.
This is why I (tell myself) I don't workout.
This dog cats.
What a good puppy!
so adorable! thanks for sharing this
that is a very awesome dog i would like to pet it
I love that guy and how he is with his dog.
My puppy does the same
Your pup is just trying to tell you that your perfect the way you are and don‚Äôt need to do anything other than love them more <3
The dog really likes to be getting love and attention.
This made me miss my dog.
I too say ‚Äúhello!‚Äù to my dog every time he walks into the room I‚Äôm in
We dont deserve pets, but we sure need them
LOL I have to hold my dog so I can do leg exercises.
The best dog.
I want to wrap both of them in a hug‚Ä¶
This was beautiful. Great video!
But I just want cuddles ü•∫
"Listen here dad...I need you...to...pay... attention....to...moi"
i have a dog like this‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs an aggressively sweet over snuggler
Someone tell homie to quit wasting his time and lift. That pup needs ya. Weights. Faster. Stronger. 



Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever, hour after hour
Work is never over
UConn??
That‚Äôs even better training honestly. Instead of doing the constant down and up motion, you have to pause for many moments to tell your doggo how much you love them :)
You just knew when the dog came in and immediately did a big stretch that this was going to be cute.
Boi does not like unnatural movements. Thinks man is broken.
People that don't like dogs need to have their head examined.
I love her!
doggo: whacha doin hoomaaaannn?
Ahhhh yes... The getting dog hairs on your mouth part of pet ownership.
original video, sauce, youtube link, Chelsea The Dog

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AIRlLfZow
seems like what those therapy dogs are doing to protect owners from repetitive movements like beating the head on the floor
I was smiling the whole with out even realizing.     
‚ò∫Ô∏èüôÇüòÉ
No exercise homan only belly rubs
Nothing like a bond with your doggy. This made me smile!
My dogs do this if I workout around them üòÇ‚ò∫Ô∏è
She's such a sweetheart ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The dog might think her human is sick and is trying to help/investigate. Without understanding that humans work out to stay healthy, those purposeful repetitive motions look like a mental illness/tic. Like when dogs obsessively turn in circles.
Who you tryna get fit for im right here!
‚ÄúDad, why are you on the floor making pained looking faces? Are you okay? Do you need me to give you a big wet kiss? Would you like to sniff my butthole? That always makes ME feel better!‚Äù -Goodest Doggo
That old UConn logo is not getting enough attention
Amazing footage keep this video forever you‚Äôll always look back and smile
What a loving dog.
I thought the dog was going to run into the next room when she heard she was adopted. And he would continue to exercise.
I love the belly laugh when pup was snuggling the guy's neck.
Love‚Äôs you incondicionally
This is exactly why I don‚Äôt have a six pack. 

I don‚Äôt actually have a dog that interferes with my workout. I don‚Äôt actually workout per se. But you get my meaning.
What she‚Äôs trying to say is ‚ÄúI love you the way you are and you don‚Äôt have to workout‚Ä¶ play with me instead‚Äù ‚ò∫Ô∏è
My dog is exactly like this but still in the puppy faze. Unconditional love but unbelievably bouncy and 0 personal space boundaries. He just tries to climb all over me. Annoying as hell but I love the dumbass :)
My dogs also do this when I try and do yoga. 

I don't even mind and we always play after. It's so adorable. They have such short lives compared to mine and j just want to spend as much time having fun and snugglin' as possible. ‚ô° 

Plus, downward dog and or sneezing means I wanna play or I'm friendly/non-aggressive, sooo he is asking for it.
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs

Dogs are angels and they deserve more rights than us
I shook my phone to get here.
dog sits under you like "time for planks now, don't go down"
Aww what an adorable sweet girl
How did you get the most precious dog I need to knowwwww
I can confirm dogs like their hoomens fat
The dog oinks like a pig and I can't get over it.
Some say that is his work out everyday.
My dog also love sneezing in my face but it a good sign of friendship and love he has toward me
Awww..... I'd never work out again. I'd just cuddle doggo all day.
This is the exact opposite of a problem!
Are you winning dad?
She is fucking precious... 

She adores him so much
I hope to one day have a dog as loving as that one
This is the wholesome content I needed today.
When we would play video games, our dog used to knock the controllers out of our hands and sit on us and block our view of the TV until we played with him. He even stomped on the reset button on the game console sometimes - he‚Äôs a dog, so it was an accident, but it became pretty frequent. He got constant attention and love in our house so he never understood why it would stop for even a moment. Dogs are the best
I mean he's cute, I don't blame her
Running but not going anywhere, pushing but not nothing is moved and he doesn't throw that big ball. That dog is confused and sympathetic to his human.
Adorable
This is so funny
My cat likes to walk around me when I do yoga
I want someone who loves me as much as your dog loves you
Hey it‚Äôs 2021 and we‚Äôre all SJWs about like everything so can we please stop making being adopted this bad thing?

Signed, all adopted people
My dog always brings me the ball whenever I work out. So dang cute!
Sooo do you want her to be doing this or not? Just asking because you are definitely encouraging that behavior.
She just parks there ahahaha
needy girl ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Quit exercising and go play with the dog
I mean. i too would climb in that man's lap for kisses?
This is the sweetest fuckin thing I‚Äôm gonna see today. She doesn‚Äôt care that she‚Äôs adopted, she knows she‚Äôs loved and has all the love to give.
My dog does this to me so bad that I end up having to close him out. I hate to do it, but he‚Äôs a 100lbs which means he weights almost as much as I do and so he‚Äôll take up my entire yoga mat and then some. I started throwing my spare mat on the floor and I‚Äôd just go from mat to mat but it‚Äôs a grass is greener situation when he only wants the mat that I am on. I do love all the snuggles though!
I don‚Äôt know why, but the first few seconds of silence then the ‚Äúhello‚Äù just cracked me up for some reason.

This is definitely in my top 3 favorite AWWW of my this subreddit. The love she has for her owner is undeniable. She just always wants to be near him and connected to him as she puts her little body up against him or her paws.

Then there‚Äôs the other part of this that is so AWWW. The reaction of the owner. His joyful laughs and the way he talks to her.
why is her ears behind? does it mean she's nervous?
Wholesome AF
That dog gives off very ‚Äúrescue dog completely aware of who saved his life back then‚Äù vibes.
What a sweet annoying goofball! And the adopted comment was uncalled for.
He loves you so much!!
Fun fact: the little stretch the dog does when they walk in is a kind of greeting. Every time I saw my dog in the morning and went to pet her she‚Äôd do that. I thought she just didn‚Äôt like pets in the morning or something until I looked it up and figured someone else out there might think the same thing
Can I please have this dog?

What a sweetheart!!!
That is one of the most disgustingly adorable displays of canine affection I've ever fucking seen...
INFURIATING!!!

i don't care WHO you are - when a pup that sweet needs some attention you IMMEDIATELY STOP whatever you are doing and love that pup!  

whatever you were doing is never going to be as important as a pup that needs love.
They are both pretty cute!
How do I swipe right on this guy??
I'm a 100% real lawyer and I have to inform you that you are required to stop your workout and pet the dog.
[deleted]
That dog's love is adversely affecting his health.
Just do planks and let her climb all over you
I have the same dog and he's exactly like this.
That sneeze on the face
My sister's dog does this. She just wants to be touched.
"What doing?"  
"Exercising"  
"OK, I love you"
She loves her daddy.
Aww
No more pushups, time for planks.
Try going down slow like 3 or 4 full seconds and the pump in your chest will be awesome
The little grunts.
My cat does this often
Probably wants to go for a walk.
Does anyone know what breed that is?
Haha üòÇ
What a sweet video of  sweet puppo
r/PetTheDamnDog
And dog wins . I love it
Funny thing is my cat does that too
My mini poodle is always all in my space, if I am on the floor for anything. Pushups, retrieving items under the couch/bed, cleaning the floor, etc.

&#x200B;

He is like, "You have entered my domain. The Guardian of the Floor demands pets, kisses, and playtime."
My dog is exactly like this. I finally figured out how to remedy the situation. I just gave up exercise.
The best companions and friends...worst workout buddies! Lol
I wish my workouts were like this :(
Y‚Äôall are so much adorable!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
The dog did a downward dog!
Just tryna get in the lap because she‚Äôs a big ol lap dog.
Probably literally the 50th video I've seen where a dog thinks it's owner is playing while exercising on the floor
What a good helper!!!
No dog expert in any sort of way, don't even own a dog (do deeply wish to have one one day), but is the dog showing kind of behavior that signals she is worried and is trying to calm him down?

As service dog do for owners with, for example, epilepsy?
I wonder if this is a breed thing. My dog does exactly this for attention.
I love that the guy was being careful when he knew the dog was around.
Totally tangential - but what‚Äôs your routine / what‚Äôre those hand things?

I wanna start doing push ups and crunches - but I heard crunches are bad for your back?

Sincerely,
A skinny fat guy
"Please stop what you are doing! I worry that you will lose all your floppy squishiness that I cuddle with! Some of us do not like rock hard abs!"
My cat also won't let me do push-ups.
My dog sneezes like this too when he sniffs me
The dogs affection also looks like it‚Äôs a bit concerned or anxious about it‚Äôs human? Is the way the human is positioned a form of submission to the way the dog sees it? I‚Äôve seen this a lot when people are exercising like this.
Such a good gorl
If god really created the world, dogs are his magnum opus. What glorious creatures
Maybe the dog ist just like hey human you don't have to play alone, I'll join you
True love
LPT: use your dog as your extra weigh. Put him on your back, put him on your shoulder‚Ä¶
My dog always does this to me while I'm playing Ring Fit Adventure and I'm on the floor doing crunches. She just ends up jumping on my stomach and lays down while I keep doing my exercise lol
best content ive seen in years OP, love it
More like "what are we doing today coach"?
Mine does stuff like this.
This is priceless!
Sweet baby is helping!
And don't dare try to close the door with the dog NOT in that room. I can't even take a shower without the dog in the bathroom or she'll scratch the door the whole time.
Mine humps me when I work out.
0:54.  That is the peak aww moment for me.  (of course followed by 0:57, the Spitting Out Of The Dog Hair moment)
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on the floor to be near me right? I‚Äôm so excited!‚Äù
Wheel snipe celly
The joy of working out with a doggo.
I love you chelsea the dog!
Dude: "What are you *doing*?"

Dog: I could ask you the same thing.
Dude, I'm a 33 year old welder and an asshole. But stuff like this my heart melt.
Your spotter is making sure you don‚Äôt hurt yourself.
What a 100% perfect good boy!
What breed of dog is that?
Too much talk about push ups, not enough talk about adorable pupper grunting noises.
The video played once for my and now has an unknown error?

Btw very cute, what kind of dog is this?
[Chelsea the dog](https://youtube.com/channel/UC62it6o5SiOSQ7JkOc5BtpQ) this is the link to this sweet pups YouTube channel! WARNING: beware of howls/cuteness.
Lol this was my cat the other day while I was trying to do push ups. I ended up collapsing on the floor from laughing too much. Didn't get much exercise done but it sure was more enjoyable haha!
r/petthedamndog
Hey Chelsey, long time no see! Still cute!
Two best friends just goofing off haha, so cute
I think she likes him
‚ÄúExercise with me‚Äù ‚Äútake me for a run‚Äù ‚Äúlet me join‚Äù that‚Äôs all I hear from your pup lol
Dogs deserve so much better than what humans provide them. Dogs are literally life-altering beings that are immensely underrated and short-lived.
My cat is like this!
This brought me some much needed joy today
Oh my god, my dream is to have a needy dog like that.
That dog is the manifestation of love .
Awwww, your girl has all the same needy-pestering moves that mine has :)
Damn that‚Äôs loveüíï
I would like more of these videos please
That‚Äôs some of the best examples of a dog who knows their person loves them and they love them back wholeheartedly!!!
I didn't want this to end. Can there be a livestream of this? I will subscribe Twitch Prime Turbo or whatever REAL quick
How's that floor mat? any recommendations?
Heartwarming vid
How to work out: put your dog near your head and everytime you do a push up, kiss your dog. Repeat this
I‚Äôve never seen a dog so full of HOLD ME energy.
***CHELSEEEAA***
Oh man I know those feels.
Dogs that are annoying in a funny way are truly my favourite. Me and my dad are soon to adopt one and i really hope it‚Äôs like thisüòÇ
You're preventing me from doing my Perfect Push-ups perfectly!
Aw sweet girl
That dog is in LOOOOVE!
I just knew right away this was a female. They are so gentle and sweet. Her cries of love to her owner made me sad and happy.
This exact thing happens when I work out.  And by work out I mean, Lay in my bed or giant beanbag chair and try and watch tv or play games.  because im fat and sad, not because im fat, just because.  BUT that is why she comes and snuggles me so it is all good in the end.
Mankind doesn't deserve dogkind
Wrestling with your dog is really good exercise.  You don'y have to exercise *OR* play.
Worst workout partner ever! But bestest friend fur-ever! 10/10 good boi
Reddit is making me like dogs more than people
Like I didn't want to have a dog bad before...
This guy loves his dog and this dog loves her guy and I am HERE for it.
I feel your pain‚Ä¶ or, joy? It‚Äôs more of the latter.
Doggo is worried he isn't engaging those lats.
The dog is like ‚Äú you don‚Äôt need to workout you are perfect human‚Äù
Omg glad I'm not the only one
This is the exact reason why I never work out! And I don't even have a dog.
Awww her name is chelsea and she is so cute! awwwwwwwww
That tail wag though. ü•∫
Is this dog part cat? That is 100% some ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not paying attention to me so I‚Äôm gonna lay on you‚Äù cat ass energy
my good sir, that there is a cat
Look how much that good girl loves her papa!
Love her socks
I'm so sorry and I feel bad of my self because I hate when My dog interrupts me while I'm exercising. I hate exercising at home and the few time I did It I wanted no One near me so I always pushed him away. I'm going to have a lot of regrets One day
The cutest way to stay out of shape.  Honestly the only excuse I'd accept.
[removed]
My dog did that, getting on the floor meant play time to her.
I don‚Äôt know why people feel the need to film themselves working out so stupid imo
This makes me miss my pup. He‚Äôs taking a nap next to me *but I miss em*
Dogs rule
Workout over, snuggle time ü•∞
Every time I try to workout at home just ends up being me on the floor with the dog. She won't let me do anything without her input üòÜ.
That *"snuffle-grumple"* sound is an announcement that attention and greetings are the only important things in the world.
You can tell Chelsea means business when she does the *S T R E E E T C H*
Lucky dog!
My keen observation skills have led me to believe that your dog loves you.
Lucky dog.
Solution: pick up the dog and use it as weight while doing squats
Omg that is the cutest thing ever!!!!!!
What you mean adopted. 
You didn't create them. Lol üòÜ
this is 100% my dog
the best workout buddy.
What is with that bike pedal ab exercise and pets? It seems to be an invitation for my cats to get themselves kicked in the face EVERY time
what kind of dog is that? :)
I just wanna SNUGGLE!!! LOVE me dammit!!‚Äô
Omg my dog does the exact same thing ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ not that I exercise üòÇ
Oh man, my cat used to do this to me. I could never get anything done
My dog does this too. I love him but it does get annoying
I like you fat
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs ü•∫
Awwwww so sweet
Don't lock your arms! Cute puppers
This is way more interesting than watching his workout
My cat does the same thing lol
They‚Äôre both so cute
Haha! your laugh is so contagious!
Anyone know the dog breed?
I have a policy for this subreddit, if it makes me say "aw" then i upvote. I could only upvote this video once.
Is that an extra large exercise/yoga mat?  Does it roll up?  I didn‚Äôt know...I could do that.
"I LOVE YOU!  I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!"
I'm using this video when people ask me how come I just don't work out at home. 3 basset hounds, a plott hound, and a Corgi mix. Enough said.
DAD that's not how you play with the ball you're supposed to throw - no, dad stop you have to throw it!
literally my dog
Nice u/ bud
Let‚Äôs me get fat. üòä
That little lady loves that guy so much!
Careful those things shred rotator cuffs randomly including people that have used them regularly
Haha awwww
I want one.
I love this!
Gotta love the enthusiasm.  "Are you dying?" I'll comfort.  "Are you playing?" I'll help.  It dosen't bother me to say I would constantly let this break my routine until I scoot them out the door.  What a pal.
Who else was waiting for him to say "you were adopted")
she‚Äôs the only reason he‚Äôs not jacked
Everything here is cute
Dogs always want attention when you are busy. It is a basic dog rule.
I'm saving this to copy his workout routine
This is now my favorite thing that exists on the internet!
Doggo is just acting as your personal trainer.
Great video!
Genuine question, was this dog raised by a fox or something? Their behavior is very similar
The noises the dogs makes are hilarious
Oh my god, when she put her head on his shoulder. Dude, my heart.....I can't take it. I love this.
What breed of dog is this?
Pupper says ‚Äúyou look great dad‚Äù
The dogs reacting is real; the humans is not.
/r/petthedamndog
Not all spotters are the best to workout with
‚ÄúGuess I‚Äôm doing planks now‚Äù
One undeniable truth here is that your dog absolutely adores and loves you.  Maybe he doesn't like you exercising and ignoring him or maybe he is trying to protect you from getting hurt.
She's so good to you. Knowing that you needed a spotter while working out. What a good girl. She definitely loves you üíû
Doggo has so much personality it just made my day
Lol I love that big stretch in the beginning. You know it‚Äôs gonna be good when the dog stretches like that.
This is every workout of my life with my dog
It‚Äôs like doing yoga with a boxer
My dog does the same.  It‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt exercise more lol
I mean, why else would you be down on his level?
my dog does this too, automatically thinks its play time or cuddle time as soon as i hit the ground
Hot dad summer? Nah, hot dog summer.
üòçüòçüòç
UCONN
wow I  wish I had a very affectionate dog
Best Tinder profile *ever*
Anyone know What breed is she I have the same type of pup!
I wish I could adopt that booty :)
It's Chelsea the dog! Most adorable. They have a cute Instagram.
I wish my dog would do this, but every time I do something he ends up putting his butt in my faceüòÖ
I am so happy my dog is not the only one that does this. She stands right above my head. I don't want to give her an uppercut every single time i come up. I am stuckkkkk
Little do we all know, this was all filmed on the same day and he has been changing clothes every cut.
üòÇ
You are sitting on the ground, therefore you must pet me!
Why is this man filming his work out?
When you‚Äôre on the floor you‚Äôre in Petlandia and at that point, all bets are off. Of course you want to play‚Äîwhy else would you be there?
What are those tools he‚Äôs using?
This is my cat. Literally verbatim in behavior, especially when I'm working and/or resting on a bench between sets.
You were chosen
Fantastic! You will remember those moments forever. I know because, I've got similar ones. One of the best parts of life.
He's trying to tell him: "You're sitting on your ass all day and when you finally get up to do some exercise, it's not even to take me on a walk!"
Man,I guess a dog would be nice in a night like this...
r/pethedamndog
This dog is so sweet I'm getting a cavity
You're not getting the full range of motion
yup. Every time
your girlfriend!
Stupid question, but what is that kind of workout called? I've been far too lazy for far too long. I need to start back up with something like this.
That was a cat in its past life.
This whole thing is just an overload of cuteness, cute guy, cute dog. Freaking adorable.
This good boy acts like my Blue Heeler. I‚Äôd be willing to argue given his intelligence he has a herding type dog in him. Love it.
You belong to him now.
üêï: ‚ÄúDo you want cute mode or hard mode for exercise?‚Äù
No working out. Only pets.
That, my dear, is true love and gratitude.
What kind of dog is that? It was so cuddly! ü§© Is that a breed thing?
That‚Äôs a lucky guy right there
What breed of dog is that?
What kind of dog is that?
such a good girl
Looks like your dog also wants to workout. He‚Äôs a THICC boy
Awawaaa
Now you too can get zero results with pointless exercises.
Lemme help!!!
Just stop and be fat and happy with the love of your life awww
Do those perfect pushup things work? I mean are they better than pushups on my hands?
Dude needs a piss
Doggo needs a piss
Dog: You work to much, let go play!!
My heart üò©‚ù§Ô∏è
This guy is ready for kids.
This made my heart happy r/ntbdbiwdfta
Cutest interrupter ever
How is this dog not called Mr Snuggles?
My dog used to do that too, but now that I exercise outside it's not an issue anymore
This is Mickey (Rocky Balboa‚Äôs coach reincarnated) just cheering you on!!
She makes cute little piggy snorts!
Both of my dogs do this anytime I‚Äôm doing yoga or floor exercises. Usually goes from working out to snuggling and scratchies.
So, do those hand held things help with wrist pain? I often have extreme pain in my wrist while doing pushups and it's annoying.
It feels like she‚Äôs alerting you to an increased heart rate and I just think that‚Äôs so precious.
What kind of dog? So cute!
"Yes I am!" [tail wag]
With so many animal videos were people don‚Äôt appreciate them this is magic to see you‚Äôre clearly wonderful to your pet
That dog loves him just the way he is.
Face into neck.  Sigh, I love my dog.
The dog is a comedian
Ok... I love this!
That it talks to you when you're trying to talk to it wood woof woof
I can able to understand this.. üòÅüòÅüòÇ
I tried to workout but my dog kept bugging me, so I‚Äôll try again tomorrow
The fact that you are laughing about this is disturbing. lol I commend you though!
Totally cute. Although does anyone else think it‚Äôs weird he‚Äôs recording himself doing a workout?
Great doggo and great owner.
I love this, thanks for the laughs\~   "you are adopted"
"Don't hurt your arms hooman, let me get under you"
Aww
My dog isn't this sweet. My dog play bites me and would probably bite my face and then have zoomies if I tried this.
So super cute.
This mans got on a backwards hat in his own house
I have a similar workout routine and similar interruptions, but from a cat
UConn!!
This actually gave me second hand joy lol
Where can I buy a mat of this size?
This is so pure I love it
Why is this dog very similar to my cat? So clingy, always headbutting, occasionally sneezing. I bet he farts rotten eggs like my cat too.
Good Puppers! Forecheck, backcheck, puppers cuddles!
Dog wants you to plank
Take that dog for a walk. Good exercise for you both.
For the love of doggo, give that good boi a hug
Hey, dad, what are we doing? ü•∞
What type of dog is this
Wondering what breed? it's the great Indian chokli. We call them Klicho too. Treat it like the other models ..and you will get a Dogecoin Ambassador worthy...
Sorry daddy no working out for you
I love this as much as that pup loves you!  Thank you for making my day better!
I love this guy!
Awwww she loooooooooooovvveeeesss uuuuuuuuuuuuu
Dogs love when people dance or exercise.
The true love , there cannot be anything in the world like this , pets are the true God gift!!
that stinky smirk like, 'yeah I was adopted, but you *chose* me dumbass'
What dog breed is this? Great temperament and size
This is way better than Kanye West Presents Donda‚Äîat least so far
Dog: So were you
I guaranty this guy only has such perfect form for filming this.
Its clearly playtime, your workout can wait!
your dog looks a rare breed called the Carolina. reminds me of my dog, who would be about as helpful as your dog is in this setting.
If you like this my friend, you need a German short haired pointer.   Check us out at gsp_photos
So heart warming to see the genuine love from both her and her human.  So amazing, we truly don't deserve doggos.
What a love

I don‚Äôt understand the title
UM IM JUST A GOOD DOG DAD
This is one of the sweetest things I have ever seen. She loves you so much!
My cats usually want to butt in and try to do yoga with me on the mat or straight up lays down behind me stopping my session . ‚ÄúNice resting spot, I will just park here thanks‚Äù
what a precious little doggo
This dog wants a walk! Take her for a walk!
You are clearly in her gym space
Great video and I can relate to this so hard. I have two young blue heelers who do the exact same thing when I workout. Like every time. I'd get frustrated at them if it wasn't so damned adorable!
I‚Äômmza doin a help dad
so cute
I like the little grunts she makes in the video when she gets close to her hooman... so cute üòç
I adopted my dog as well and this is exactly what she does. I've been away from her for 6 weeks and miss her more than anything. Adopt don't shop.
What kinda dawg is that
what breed of dog is Chelsea? I MUST KNOW SHE IS ADORABLE
Is there an actual explanation for this behavior? Like obv his dogo loves him but she almost seems concerned. Like when a medical dog senses a seizure coming on. Does something about our physiology while exercising worry dogs?
She looks a lot like the dog I had growing up named Lady. She was a golden retriever with the same markings as this dog, and she smiled and moved similar too. 

She was so sweet and just wanted to be with me all the time. Sometimes it seems like she‚Äôs in the way, but she‚Äôs just trying to tell you she loves you. 

It‚Äôs been 12 years and I still miss her.
I was adopted, I don‚Äôt get it
You are so lucky to have that dog.  What a sweet, fun little soul.   I don't know where they came from or how you two found each other, but I think when they met you, they knew they'd hit pay dirt.
Your dog loves you so much, adopted or not.
Fuck I love dogs!

Years ago, I was home for college summer break, doing workouts at home. My parents' mini dachshund would lick my face while I was on all fours doing leg lifts (on elbows and knees), then circle beneath me and lay down, her head in my hands. Giving/getting kisses while doing that workout was the best! She actually just passed away a few weeks ago at 17. Can't ever get upset with workout loves.
What breed is that?
Such a sweet hunde. Mine is just like that. What did humans do to deserve such creatures
this bad form. the supination is useless because youre mostly targeting triceps. make the stance wider to target pectorial muscles otherwise the twisting motions is a waste of energy.
My cats are doing the same thing when I do my workout at home
Cute
The best workout buddy
What breed?
So cute
What a sweet beanbag üòå
My 15 year old beagle does the same thing anytime I get on the floor to work out. He‚Äôs constantly underfoot and begging for attention. I love it.
DUDE! She is the absolute sweetest! Just too cute bro
Workout buddy
Awww man this is adorable, I miss my dog so much :(
So sweet and loving, just wants to be close and play with human <3
Somebody wants snuggles üòÇ
This is so relatable today while i wad training (i did that exercise that OP did whit the exercise ball whit the feet in the ear) and my dog came up and just laid down on my stomach and, whit out having another word for it, hugged me and later pressed his head on my shoulder like OP‚Äôs dog did in the video and it warmed my heart, im glad at least one other person has experienced the same thing and i hope more will. And how enjoying it can be since you dont want to say no when they are being so cute
oh my heart...that is one playful, loyal dog....what breed is it?
I need to do more core.
No no hooman,just love me , don't do anything else. What a good doggo
Awww. He loves you lots!
Awwwwwwwwwwwww
I love this my dog loves to come up and investigate when I'm doing floor exercises it's quite distracting!
My dog looks a lot like that, and acts exactly like that down to the nuzzling on the neck, weird
Every time. When I do pull ups my dang dog flips out and starts barking so loud.
She‚Äôs perfect!
"I love you just the way you are."
What kind of dog is that?
Such a happy doggo!
So sweet.
What she is adopted? I thought that was his biological dog.
That is the most loving dog I've ever seen lol what a cutie
Its so cute i died
This is awesome but I can‚Äôt get the past the sit-ups with a backwards hat thing
"what are you doing" my dog does the exact same thing, and that's usually my response too
It‚Äôs nice to see the genuine love between these two!  How precious!
She wants attention from her hooman.. üòÇ that is adorable ü•∞
The dogs probably like why are you moving so weirdly like that.

Your the weird one, at least in the dogs eyes.
Man this is exactly why working out at home has not really been a thing since the pandemic started. And it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going to lock her away somewhere while I work out, it‚Äôs too mean :(
Animals are already superior to human when something funny happens. Humans tend to pretend but animals are genuinely doing stupid things.
r/PetTheDamnDog
The is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen
I miss my girl!!!
I understand very much. This is familiar.
LA Beast here
I‚Äôm just curious as to why this guy records his workouts
Adorbs.  Im just not a fan of this style(fur) dog.  They always always always seem very needy or very very snippy.  This one of course is not but these ones always seem to have a husky like personality where it is very animated but its acts super animated when it sulks. Or is super timid and lets you know.  Ted talk
I just recently put my dog down and this makes me miss her so much. Hold on to your dog and cherish moments like these because one day they‚Äôll be gone and you‚Äôll miss them
Lim Jahey?
U/savebot
My dog does this exact same thing and I love her for it (even tho it‚Äôs annoying af) I think it‚Äôs because they think we are in pain, and in some ways we are. Dogs are the best ü•∞
This makes me so happy!!!
The best exercise partner ever! Good doggie!
What a sweetheart (the dog, I have no idea about the guy)
Fuck i miss my dog.
That is one great pupper.
Haaaaaa
Cute. My cat does this as well. Annoying but adorable.
This dog reminds me of my son. Better because he'll learn to gtfo someday. Worse because I can't put him down.
damn cute, ty dude just made my day better
Time for a puppy love break!
‚ô°
Genuine lockdown struggles!
Like its not already hard enough to motivate yourself working out!
Dog be like.. why spend so much time exercising in the boring indoors? Take me for a walk
I wasn't planning on watching the whole 1:27 of this video, but it was just too cute! lol
Good dog
You can never get work done with pets around
What breed of dog is this?? So frickin cuteeee
Beautiful baby üíù
I needed this. ‚ù§
You two look so so cute!
He was trying to tels you: give to me atenction 1d1ot üòÇ
how cute, love üñ§
Working out at home with a dog (or in my case 3) is both super fun and super frustrating. They‚Äôre the best!

Omg this is so cute. That dog loves him so much

I see dog :D I like
This is just how Carolina Dogs are. My dog looks exactly like this one and she behaves exactly the same way. They're ridiculous and I love them.
I needed to see this
I love how the owner just gives up at some points üòÑü•∞
Does anyone know what breed of dog that is?
take your fucking dog out dude
