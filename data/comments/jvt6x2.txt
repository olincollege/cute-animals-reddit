The dogs reaction is kinda like ‚ÄúHow did I get this hat?‚Äù

But it looks happy to have the hat so it‚Äôs all good
This is like the intro for one of those old family sitcoms where they‚Äôre all passing the camera to each other
*Super Mario Odyssey* (2017)
‚ÄúHello? I‚Äôm dog, did this thing record that?‚Äù
Now that's a Hat trick.
God I miss my good girl. Malinois are the best. You got to put in the work though.

Me, thinking he was gonna hit the camera with the hat: lol u missed loser

Me, seeing the dog: oop, i missed, loser
What a cutie. Both of them.

LOVE the coordinated outfits!
My new pup HATES hats, so much so I suspect the old owner wapped her with his hat. My old smaller dog likes the attention of wearing a hat. The older dog figured the younger dog would stay away and will wear the hat for a long time now to keep the young big pup away.

Random question: is there a reason police and military mostly use German shepherds? Or is it just coincidence?

Thats a Belgian melinois right?
Anyone else expect the owner just dashing on all fours up and over the ramp?
That‚Äôs awesome my favourite part is when the dog catches the hat and looks up, haha doggo.

Probably fake. Notice that you don't actually see the hat land. Chances are dog was already wearing a hat.
Damn who‚Äôs he?
Cut as soon as he gets out of frame and thats why he was completely out of frame when the dog comes up? Also explains why he comes back in the the other side.

Fake though. You can see his shadow suddenly disappear after he steps off screen.
Anyone else get a maga/"back the blue" vibe?  Not saying the dog has been trained to bark at Black people, but I'm not *not* saying it...

He looks like those male strippers. What were they called? They did that show. Chippendales. Do you guys remember that? They would rip off their clothes and throw them like that.
