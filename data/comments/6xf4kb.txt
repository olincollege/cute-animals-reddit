I want an office dog.
Just to reassure all you lovely people, Office Dog lives in the same building we work in and she has many, many comfortable and soft places to sit.

Just not that couch.
This is how my dog "asks" to get on the couch at my house
http://i.imgur.com/8CSjTTH.gifv
Are you hiring? I will happily work in exchange for being allowed to pet that dog.
Dang. From the look of it, no one is allowed on that couch.
My dog used to think she was sneaky, jumping up to the place I'm about to sit and then one day I accidentally sat on her 
Just curious, what are the logistics behind office dog? Where does he/she sleep? Does someone bring him home? Is there an official keeper of dogs that walks and feeds pup? What about the vet? Weekends?
Maybe this is the day they relent....
Look, doggo, I'm sorry but you have fur.  And that fur gets on things.  I know that you didn't decide to have fur, but I didn't decide that either.  

I mean we could shave you bald, I suppose, but I don't think either of us would want that.  

Point being, we can't have fur getting on this couch.  End of story.

Now...next business:  WHO WANTS A SQUEAKY TOY???
Great idea for a Start-up: Office dog couches for offices with startup office dogs!
"One day we will be together couch, one day."
We have an office dog. His name is Buddy. I was the only one who didn't want him when we found him. Now I'm literally the only one who takes care of him. 

Every morning I arrive an hour earlier than everyone else to walk and feed him, I stay a couple hours later than everyone else to walk and feed him at night, and I come in on the weekends to walk and feed him once in the morning, and again at night.

You would think I hate it, but it's not his fault everyone else wanted the joys of owning a pet and not the responsibilities that come with it, so I can't help but love the little dude, and would rather inconvenience myself than have to get rid of him or watch him be neglected.
My German shepherd does this at home, even though she is already allowed on the couch. She waits for both my husband and I to invite her up. Completely unnecessary but such a polite, silly girl. 
[deleted]
"but.... is soft.. :o"
My dog is a little rebel about it. She won't hop on the couch even if you invite her to, while in a humans presence. But leave the room and come back and there she will be, snuggled into the cushions looking like the cat that ate the canary. And no amount of reassuring her that its ok will keep her from hopping right down. We got her from a rescue.. guess her first people weren't cool about the couch. ::shrugs:: 
"Fuck your rules!"
My wife's cat is allowed on the couch, but not if we're eating.  Usually she'll sit nearby waiting for us to finish, but sometimes she tries to test the limits of the rule.  She has a very nuanced grasp of what "on the couch" means.

Armrests don't count as long as she doesn't touch the cushions.  Pillows on the couch are off limits, but other objects, like a box, are in-bounds.
That couch looks familiar...
I love dogs. I dated someone (and lived with her for awhile) who had a couple dogs. I'm insanely allergic. I was on prescription antihistamines and was still very symptomatic. I basically had a bad cold for 8 months.

Anyway, lesson learned. Then I get a new job a few years back. Everything's fine. Then a month into it, they start allowing people to bring in their dogs. I express some concern, but get shut down hard, and as the new guy I shut up. A couple weeks go by, miserable every day. I tell my boss, I tell HR. Nada. So I start taking time off because I'm feeling shitty all the time.

I get flak for too much PTO. I bring up the dogs. The response I got: "Seriously? What's your problem with dogs?" I mention allergies, get told everyone has allergies and to suck it up like an adult/professional. So I quit.

My question is: what the fuck was I supposed to do?
For some reason I know that she is pressing down her head super hard
What kind of dog? My German Shepherd looks the same but we rescued her from a shelter in south carolina but we can't figure out what her mix is.
Holy fuck an office dog.

LET HER ON THE DAMN COUCH.

Look at those eyes
I wouldn't let my dog on a casting couch, either. Good call.
Thanks for calling her dog and not doggo.
We have Office Dogs Here,  They Suck, Act Crazy,  Bark,  Always trying to find stuff to stick their nose in,   Nothing but trouble,  How about an office cat?
Our dog was not allowed in the couch either. I never even really suspected her of getting on it. Then one morning I had to leave for work exceptionally early and came downstairs to find a perfect little circle of dog so soundly, snuggly asleep on the couch I couldn't even be mad at her because she was just too darn cute! 
I'm cynophobic (afraid of dogs), and the idea of office dogs terrifies me. 

Don't get me wrong, dogs are the cutest and most awesome thing on the planet, but in real life they scare me shitless and I'd be unable to do my job. No idea what I'd do, people *can* be willfully ignorant about stuff like this.
Not to be "that guy", but I don't believe people should be bringing pets to the office anyway. If I walk into a room where a dog, cat, etc. has been, my eyes will be worthless until I leave for a while and rinse my eyes out. Yes, there are people who are very allergic to animals, and cannot be around them.
Doge so love,

Doge so life.

Cate gets near,

Doge gets knife.

And cate is kill,

Wow, such amaze,

Doge is thrill.
LET HER ON THE COUCH YOU MONSTERS. 


What kind of office allows dog to work there?
Where can I get that couch?

My dogs do this to ask permission up. They will stand there, head resting on the couch and look at us with big sad eyes till we tell them "ok"

We have facility dogs at work that have been trained to use that to ask for permission to get on the couch. It's adorable. 
That is the more acceptable version of marking territory i can think of
 My step-mother had a Cocker Spaniel who knew that he was not allowed to take his bone into the sitting room. So he would lie in the lounge with just his head and front paws across the thresshold into the hall, and look at her with a "The *bone* is not in the sitting room" expression.
This is my dogs way of asking permission to get ON the couch. She'll stand there indefinitely and. It get up if we're home. Once we say "up" she knows it's cool and joins us. 
I've seen that couch from somewhere...

You have an office dog??? That's awesome! 
I have 4 office doggos at the minimum, sometimes 6 or 7 depending on what is going on. Mornings start with a big off leash walk where more doggos join us. They are all allowed on the couch unless its siesta time, then the couch is mine. It does freak some folks out, but fuck them, I dont want them as clients anyway...

Not sure if eating couch or resting head on couch. 
I'd love to work in an officer if there was an office dog.
wait is the dog eating it?
Rebel without using paws?
An office dog! That is so cool! But who takes care of the dog at night?
My dog does the same thing. We don't let him on the couch if we are eating or we have to call him up. But when he does this and you get the puppy dog eyes it's hard to ignore him. We just say that his head gets heavy and needs to rest it. 
I'd feel the same way if all I had was four legs and I had to stand all the time or choose to sit/lay on the hard ground while my owner stares into a screen and mashes keys all day and every know and then say's "Linda! Did you get that email?"
"I'm *not* on the couch, human. Problems?"
He saw a cat
what breed is the dog? i don't recognize it
hopefully he doesn't have to lay on that hard floor all day, or what's the point of taking him to the office? that sounds more like a real punishment.

I am so sorry you have to live with that. 
I'm jealous. I, too, want a work dog.
Beautiful facial hair.
I had a dog tall enough to put his head on the table. He wanted to see what was up there, even if he knew not to sample it.
My dog does this too, and I think it's less rebellion and more hoping/pleading you'll invite her up on the couch

Does it have a problem with digging/scratching? Leather seems like a way better material for a dog to be on than cloth, if only because any shed hair will be easier to clean off.
It's good like this, ima put my head like this. 
Stickin' it to da man!
Poor doggo needs a good brushing.
Our dog always leans half of her butt on the couch.
When I was growing up I had a dog that always liked to test the rules. 

*"I can't get on that? How about if I have 3 legs and my head on it but one leg stays on the floor?"*

It was annoying at the time, but it was great practice for working with lawyers as an adult.

My dog does this when he's asking permission to come up on something. Usually when he wants up on the bed, but wants to make sure there's enough room for him. <3
You let that dog on that couch now you monster!
It shows you don't have a dog. She is asking permission.

Good thing that lady in the background was crossing her legs.
Dogs are the best kind of people.
i've seen that couch...
This is exactly how my dog makes her wishes to be up on the sofa known...
Why won't they let it on the couch? ... I don't like sitting on the floor... :'(
It is insane how similar this looks to my dog. Shepard collie mix?

Stick it too the man Office Dog, stick it to the man!
How can I work someplace that has an office dog? 
Should get a mini couch for her.
What type of dog is that?  She looks so cool :0
TELL HER SHE'S BEAUTIFUL FOR ME
If we had an office dog, I might enjoy going to work.
R/couchnose should be a thing.  I don‚Äôt have the skills..... but surely someone does. 
That's a nice lookin' dog.  What is it?  A German Shepherd Golden Retriever Mix?
what makes this so extra adorable is the slight gleam of reproach in that puppy's eyes. 
hug that doggie. 
Newfies , no respect for personal space..
