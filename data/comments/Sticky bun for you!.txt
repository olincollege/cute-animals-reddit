That first swap happened so fast I actually thought the same dog got two buns.

Although given how fast they could chew one of those things, maybe it was just the same few dogs popping up for seconds.
This little gang never gets old 😍
Had to double take thinking the first doggo got two!
I don't blame them, I want one of those sticky buns
What are these? My dogs would love a fresh batch.
Looks like bao buns made with ube (purple yam)
Made an audible "aww" sound at the end of the video when the little doggo received bun and then looked at the title of the subreddit it was posted to. Well played OP, well played.
I expected a cat.
I think I have a deja vu. Wasn't there a video just like this, but with different kind of food?
I can just picture the tails wagging. 😂
What are these "Sticky buns" you speak of. I'm completely uncultured. Human food?
The little guy is like "this is fine... fight over your food large dogs, while I...I am safe, I know mine is coming"
I had serious anxiety counting the dogs and the buns making sure there were enough !

Oh man, I need to figure out what those are and find a recipe! Those look amazing!
Can I be one of her dogs? I love sticky buns!
Why does this person always give the leftest one treats last?! I swear he’s the first to be in line all the time!
I know this person has fed them carrots and lettuce before but what I'm impressed about is how it looks exactly the same down to the order and the dogs waiting.

I need a source now if this is a channel with regular feeds

Okay so, I saw this post without realizing this is in the r/aww subreddit I said aww ❤ just so cute!

P.S. Hey can I have some sticky buns?
u/Vredditdownloader
I aww'd when I saw the little pup at the end.
One time I made a nice pancake and egg breakfast for my dogs. Gave it to them separately in their crates so they wouldn’t feel the need to gulp it down and hopefully take the time to enjoy it.

They both got it down in about 2 seconds
Dogs are so weird. How can they even enjoy their food when they knock it back in a split-second? And then after they eat it, they don't even seem upset that there's no more. Wouldn't they want to eat at least 5 or 6 of those babies? And they look so contented. Does that mean that the saying "Ignorance Is Bliss" is true?
I swear I've seen this so many times but it still gets me how cute this is.

I'm not too sure about this, but isn't feeding grain based stuff to dogs really bad for their teeth? The only reason why humans can get away with it is because we brush ours

Not one thank you.

I’m on a 3 day fast and I think this is going to break my fast. 😵
What is she giving them??
I swear I've seen this exact same gang of dogs but with watermelons.
Call me a “party pooper” if you must, but I don’t think this is a good thing, cute as it may be, because it teaches the dogs to beg.
r/vredditdownloader
I hope they don’t feed them too many more sticky buns! Those dogs are already looking Husky.
Am I de only one who heard in their head huuummm humming hummm?🤔🤔🤔
What are those pink buns called? I'd love to make sure.
How many huskies are there? I can’t figure out of some are getting two buns. Haha
I need these in my life
Adopt me 😍
I would give the little one first)
the buns look so soft!
Brightened up my day. The little guy was a sweet surprise
This is a wonderful way to share.
I spent way too long trying to spot where the cauliflower was edited out.
I want one!
This is cool, my parents dog only eats meat and his dog food. Can’t get him to eat any kind of bread, fruit, or veggie...except grass, he loves grass for some reason
the goodest of boys
EXTRA WHOLESOME right at the end
Now I’m craving steamed buns 🤤
That’s very cool!!!
One sneaky dog got three of them.
Wow, I love this so much
My heart grew after seeing this!
i honestly thought those were red onions at first, lol
Idk why but for some reason the one who gets it 4th and is waiting that entire time in the left corner makes my heart ache. I just wanna give him a hug
This video makes me really happy thank you
Is it weird that I want one too
i got so excited when i saw the small bun
That last Mal looks really sweet!
Last but not least.

Edit: The last doggo from outside is the guy with a mullet.
These dogs could have gone back and pretend they haven't taken a sticky bun but they didn't so everyone could have some because they're good boys 
Moral of the story, don't hoard toilet paper just because you can and some some for everyone

They mean the type of dog is a malamute, not a husky. They look similar huskies but they are a different breed of dog. It’s like saying that pugs and bulldogs are the same breed. Malamute has nothing to do with where they live it’s the name of the breed of dog.They’re still good bois though.

A cute dog post. Instead of automatically downvoting a dog post like I usually do, I will not.
As soon as I saw the little bun I was like "there better be a little doggo" 

Totally delivered
What is a sticky bun? I want one now
CAN WE RECOGNIZE THE FACT THQT THERE WAS A SMOL STICKY BUN FOR THE SMIL BOY AT THE END
Why does that look so satisfying?
This is magical
This may be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.

This is it. The pinnacle.
Aaaaaw the little one it's gorgeous
hahah, the last one was himself a sticky bun
Six different dogs with distinct markings, and everyone waited his or her turn at the window with no lunging, though the dog fed third looked a little impatient after the second dog jumped into the spot the first had occupied.  Impressive.
I thought they were potatoes but ok
I think this is the most perfect video to ever exist
The last dog looks about 7 foot tall
The little one at the end!!!
the last one broke me

And as always .. was eagerly waiting for that lil ones bite 😍
Oh I suppose all Huskies look alike to you?

Woah! They are so cute ❤️
Man, I just want to eat one of those buns. The dogs are adorable and I also want to pet every single big one and carry that tiny one for as long as she will acquiesce, but I also want to eat one of those buns.

I can hear the chomps.
That last bun was great!  Boop bun!
those dogs are beautiful
Nice
i watched this video on repeat for few minutes. made my morning. I just want to pet them!

For people wondering or just reading and didn't know: These are MALAMUTES not huskys! Search "malamute and husky" there's some comparison photos. Usually you can tell them apart by size or by their head (malamutes have wide set ears, giving them a very bear-like expression, while huskys have pretty high set ears, giving them more of an awake expression)

Very good big bois and very good small boi.
The little dog at the end was the cutest, especially since she had the hidden bite size bun! 😍
Any good soal will give me a recipe for these kind of buns.
I like good couple stick my buns 🙃
Omg their was even a tiny one!!!!
Hey 😄
The lighter haired doggy only got one and the bigger pup snagged 3.
and perhaps a sticky bun... or four....
What are these??? (The food not the dogs) I want to know so I can feed them to my pup

So cool they were tall enough to reach through the window!
Now that's is the best train dogs they all got there at the table and eight together
