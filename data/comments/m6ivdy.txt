I might be high, but I thought the second picture was the door of the fridge and there was a mini Noodle in the door too lmao
Same, Noodle, same...
I HAVE SEEN THE END TIMES. WHEN THE MILK IS GONE AND THE DOORS NEVER OPEN. AND IN THAT BLACK ABYSS I HAVE SEEN THE TRUTH. THERE IS NO GOD, ONLY DOG.
[deleted]
Most people store Noodles in the pantry, but to each their own.
I tend to try and fill the cold creeping existential dread with things from the fridge. Does that count? ... Can Noodle and I be BFFs now? ü§û
Man Getchyo god damn dirty ass out the fridge
You should probably not let your cat chill in the fridge
r/kitchenconfidential crying in the walk-in is the norm
That‚Äôs one cool cat
I don't think noodles should go in the fridge.
Publix Choco milk!!   üòç
[deleted]
Please don‚Äôt put your cat in the fridge.
God I miss Publix.
Real sanitary
Noodle think he is pineapple
The idea of a cat jumping in my fridge or freezer and me accidentally closing the door terrifies me lol
Oh Noodle! You so beautiful ! He likes it cold I guess? Sometimes having lots of fur is hot. Cool down in the fridge noodle
Cute cat, but just reaffirms my hesitation to eat anything from someone‚Äôs house who owns cats.
That's just gross dude. I'm always chasing my cats out from my kitchen.
Somebody shops at Publix.
You keep your Ewok in the fridge?
Publix. Where shopping is a pleasure. Except one of the heiresses paid a bunch of money to the January 6th insurrection.

THE MORE YOU KNOW!
Noodle is supervising the snacks.
That's kinda gross tho
Ah yes, litter paws where your food goes.....  I'm having an existential crisis over how many people aren't questioning this lack of hygiene, while we're a year into covid lmao
Nasty...
I would never let any living animals into my fridge. Absolutely fucking disgusting
Cats don't wipe their butts or feet and now it's in your fridge.
Ooooh dats nasty
It's fucking disgusting to have a cat in the fridge. Get your shit together. Just gross.
One thing I've learned from this sub is that cat owners hygiene is atrocious.
Probably just saw the Joker movie
I see you back there, cold brewed coffee. I'm coming for you.
I know how he feels.
Publix brand. Nice.
Publix gang
Those eyes
"WHY AM I SO COLD"
why would u let that furry in the fridge
Why is your CAT Next to your food?????
[deleted]
It looks more like ‚ÄúI put my cat in the fridge for internet points, the cat does not like being in the fridge‚Äù
And get cat hair all over your food? No thanks.
/r/NamFlashbacks
This gives me anxiety. I‚Äôd never encourage any animal to place themselves in fridge.
He‚Äôs a cat but you named him after food! It‚Äôs no wonder he is confused about his identity.
that's so filthy, I would throw everything out
[deleted]
So that‚Äôs who ate the last donut.
You should post in r/FridgeDetective

There should be a dating app based on fridge pics. 

It would legitimately be the best dating app out there.

Kind of gross to let your cat in the fridge no? I mean, they literally carry shit on their paws from using the litter box...

I've been seeing a lot of these. Starting to think Reddit cat owners like poop matter in their food ü§£
Thats gross as fuckü§¢
is he ok
That cat has seen some things.
That‚Äôs actually extremely unhygienic
What is it with cat owners and letting their fucking cat go wherever/do whatever it wants? There was this post a few months back where the cat was eating a waffle STRAIGHT OUT OF THE TOASTER on the kitchen counter. Of course it got thousands of upvotes and several awards. Y'all are disgusting as hell
*A cup of milk, a dash of cheese*

*The start of many recipes*

*But take the time to really prep...*

*Before the "Add the Noodle" step!*
I, too, would have an existential crisis if my humans were the kind of people who managed to put chocolate milk back in the fridge and didn't consume it all in one sitting.
Aww so cute! there is shit and piss cat litter all over your food!
Ewwwwww.  Fuck.  As a cat owner.  Ew.  Litter paws.  I have a $300 litter box that auto cleans too
That's gross. Steps in their own piss and shit and directly to where you store your food.
Eww who puts live animals where they keep their fresh food. Grim!
I too like to have mine there
Few too many swigs of the old chocolate milk.
After whatever experience I guess Noodle is just chillin.

*i'll see myself out*
Am I...noodle? This where noodle lives?
"This catpartment building has excellent A/C but is a bit low on natural light."
Don't check the "crisper" drawer, I buried some brown mini carrots in there.  It was dark, I was scared.

‚ÄúThey told me I could be anything. So I became a catdiment.‚Äù
Hehe cute cat
So, is that his special place or did he just
r/fitsperfectly ?
Noodle is a fantastic name for a cat!
He looks like he's facing inwards and you stuck googly eyes to the back of his head
NOODLE!!! ü§£
That cat has seen some shit.
That cat has seen some things, man.
Noodle is my spirit animal
Noodle, my friend, you are not alone.

Stay strong Noodle. The great question of life is a wonder to behold.
As one does, on occasion. Since I'm a walking hot flash, I'd like to have my existential crisises in the fridge, too!
Noodle embodying a lot of us right now....
With that blanket Noodle can easily sit in the freezer
They took my milk.
Omg I love Noodle
Try the Fruity Pebbles coffee creamer. It'll change your life. üëç
We don't put our noodles in the fridge.... Weird people out there
Bahahaha...... I‚Äôm sorry...... üòÇ the expression on his face..... ‚ÄúI have seen something I cannot unsee‚Äù 
Noodle is the best.
What type of cat is that?
That is one cool cat.
It looks the cat saw some wicked s***
That cat is tripping balls
Same tho
You seem to have a pretty well-balanced diet
Cool cat
"I have tasted of chocolate milk....I can never go back!"
Your cat looks like it was smoking what it thought was a cigar, but what was really a stick of dynamite that a mouse painted to look like a cigar.
Damit noodle not again
What is fridge?
Think he just just wants some chocolate milk bro
Same.
Yeah, i felt the same after watching **Kuso Limitless** too. HUG!
I always prefer to have my crisis moments in a nice cold fridge ü§£
You hear that cat gets it's salsa from New York City?
Someone's rethinking life experiences here :O
me too noodle
That makes two of us.
"This is a box, and a box is a box....what if.... everything is a box?! What if I'm a box?!" - Noodle
I just met Noodle, but I would die for him.
He drank the purple stuff
Awe and oh hey that creamer is really good lol
That cat has either seen some shit in his life or is high af.
Same, Noodle. Walk-ins are good for that.
The extra 40lbs I‚Äôve put on, say the same thing. I feel you Noodle.
I love the name noodle!  My cats name is, Queso! I love when pets are named after foods!
Perhaps I am a Noodle
Awww he just wants to be chilly, I feel that ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
HEEEEY MY CATS NOODLE BRO
WHY AM I NOODLE WHEN I AM CLEARLY AN OREO?
Just chill'n
But my cat is named noodle you can‚Äôt have one too
That look sells the picture perfectly.

Your chocolate milk is expired.

Lol
My kitty also likes getting into the fridge. I'm nervous that I'm going to accidentally shut the door on him one day and end up with a meat popsicle.
Don't think I've ever identified so much with a photo.

That's me after watching 2020 go by and what millions are doing to others.

Just going to sit here in my fridge bit longer where it's "safe".

ps. please make sure -NOOOODLE- doesn't ever get accidentally closed in overnight yikes
I had a cat that did this. I didn't like it, he could die in there. So, one day I closed the door and counted to 30, he never did it again.
I love Noodle
NOODLE I LOVE YOU
Noodle is mad suspicious of that bottle of ranch.

"I swear it moved, Linda"
Omg that face.! <3
It's late and I'm tired, and I thought the second picture was the fridge door and thatyou had a second mini Noodle having his mini existential crisis


Edit: man...I should really read some of the comments before posting mine
thats disgusting
"If I'm not a toasted marshmallow, what the hell am I?"
This cat is a mood
Storing bread in the fridge actually makes it go stale faster.
"Get the red Pace picante hooman. The medium is weak sauce." - Noodle

I have my existential crisis in the fridge too. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve gained 20 pounds in the last year.
If descartes can live in an oven why can't noodles ponder in the fridge?
Publix Chocolate Milk ftw.

Aww! What a crazy kitty....and those eyes!  Wide open for...reasons. üò∏üòä
My cat is also named Noodle. Will provide pics if I remember to lol
Looks like more of an 'eggs essential' crisis.  Yall aint got no eggs!
**I CAN SMELL THE COSMOS**
So now it's cute. but when I do it, it's "creepy" and I should "get out of their fridge"
I am noodles...
Publix chocolate milk, I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.

He sees what really happens when the light turns off
Aww I hope Noodle feels better
Awwww purrfessor fweez
Haha! Love how you have green onions growing in the back of the fridge. Looks a lot like my fridge.... Pretty kitty!
"Am noodle... So am food... But also am cat.... so am not food... Where do I belong? What am I?"
Oh my gosh, his eyes made me laugh out loud. Thank you Noodle!!
He likes that Publix chocolate milk. He's just trying to figure out how to open it.
Show me the Noods!  

I love the Noods!  Long live the Noods!
I already love Noodle.
I do as well! It‚Äôs called a walk in and it happens usually everyday. 
Sincerely a food service industry worker!
You were trying to find out if it changed colour weren't you?
That‚Äôs not a cat having an existential crisis.

>!That‚Äôs a taxidermied cat in a final state of shock!<
I love this cat
Ma! There‚Äôs a weird looking cat in the fridge. I don‚Äôt want it fighting with Lucy
I was wondering where he was!
I am not a fan of cats, more of a dog person, but this is too adorable!
Why do our fridges look the same? Minus the cat
Opens the fridge....Noodles it is, I guess.
HE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THE LIGHT WHEN YOU CLOSE THE DOOR!
his name is noodle. His Name Is Noodle. HiS nAmE iS nOoDlE! HIS NAME IS NOODLE!?
Everyone should be like Noodle !
r/catscalledfood so cute!
He‚Äôs got some thoughts about some stuff, man.
Does noodle always look like hes having a bad trip? Lmao hes just hella enlightened and zooming through the cosmos
Samesies!
noodle is my spirit animal
what breed of cat is this?
This  is a normal face for a himilyan cat. Is show this to my girl but she would cry
As a Wisconsinite I am impressed with the size of your cheese drawer.
That is truly hysterical
Makes sense, since her name is noodles.
Must be the Country Crock.
That's a cold derp.
Sometimes I wish I could also have my existential crisis in the fridge too.
Choccy milk!
Our Himalayan does this too!
I can not stop laughing.
r/namflashbacks
Fucking gross cat litter paws in the fridge
I, too, go to the fridge during an existential crisis.
His butthole is on a shelf where you put food.
You let a cat into your fridge?? That's honestly disgusting.
This is the cat equivalent of going to the walk-in to scream for 5 minutes. I feel this.
I see noodle works in food service.
If your gonna name me after food imma commit 100%
That‚Äôs fucking gross wtf
He just needed to chill-out
For a second I thought what was on the right was a side door and there was a miniature version of noodle haha
What do you except when u name a cat noodles, he‚Äôs obviously gonna be in the fridge
Oh Noodle!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
Publix chocolate milk is the best, only the real know
Am I in heaven, surrounded by cream, whole milk, cheese and chocolate milk?  -Noodle
Am I family or food?
Sometimes I too feel a lot like Noodles
I wish there was an award for the best Reddit title

Omg-I looked at this 10 minutes ago and I still can't stop cry-laughing
‚ÄúYeah just close the door, my soul is already dark and cold. Fridge will keep it cooler‚Äù -Noodle
lol, it‚Äôs like a face with nothing but eyes.
He really can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs not butter
Everybody gangsta til the fridge starts meowing
Same, Noodle. Same.
Same, Noodle. Same.
Did anyone else think the right side of the image was the fridge door for a second and think Noodle on the left was looking at a mini Noodle on the right? Or just me?
This is very unsanitary.
Blending in with the chocolate milk, camouflage!
This is cute but became a new ‚Äúwhy I don‚Äôt eat at everybody house‚Äù for me
Noodle is absolutely cute and adorable!
I hate cat hair in the fridge.  My brother has 2 cats and i see hair in his fridge all the time.
Looks like River from Firefly
Creepy and weird...
All I can think about is the cat shit that is on its feet, is now in the fridge with the food. That's just nasty.
Barb
My cat did this a few times and got closed in the fridge once. I was cooking and was taking stuff out of the fridge and left it open for a few seconds and closed it without looking inside. Our cat loves watching us cook she'd sit at the edge of the counter and just watch and sometimes get a bite of spinach, carrot or broccoli. After I accidentally closed her in the fridge i heard quiet meowing and was wondering where she went. Opened the fridge to find her sitting there like nothing happened and refusing to get out XD
It is how he keeps his cool
Scoot over and make some room Noodles. In this house we share the existential crisis fridge
Cold noodle üòç
I am Noodle, Noodle is me.
Your cat is really bad at cocaine and chill!
noodle is so relatable. i wish i could go through my daily breakdowns in the fridge then i would chill sooner.
I first thought there was an indentical smaller cat in the door of the fridge....
Please be careful he doesn't open the door when you aren't around and get stuck in there. Also please double check your washer and dryer before shutting the door. I have heard heartbreaking stories.

Be well and love to you and Noodle
I know exactly how Noodle feels
Cute cat. But having animals in the same place you keep your food is just No. I can‚Äôt get over it.
That is fucking gross.
‚ÄúWould you like a sandwich? I have bread, cheese, and cold cat‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you mean, cold cuts?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
The amount of awards on this post is baffling to me
I have a question. What meals do you make with those random assortment of few items?
Hope Noodle hasn‚Äôt expired yet...
Honestly imma try that
Are people really that desperate for fake internet points that they stage this nasty shit? Yikes.

Hope it was worth endangering your cat and getting hair and shit all over your food.
[deleted]
Disgusting
Me too. That's why I weigh 350 lbs.
That's one hell of a bachelor fridge. Quesadilla ingredients, something to drink and a lot of condiments
Very nasty. Say no to potlucks!
That is disgusting.
Yuck x 2000
This is why I don't eat at other peoples house
Comment sections like this make me think that people haven‚Äôt heard of antibacterial spray/wipes. Is it the best idea? No. Is your fridge/surface forever tainted? Also no.
What cat race is it?
[removed]
Chocolate milk, dunkin creamer, STOK shredded cheese, Himalayan cat. I would eat everything in this fridge
Thats disgusting.
An animal that walks in a box of its own turds in my fridge?

Not even once.  Cute, but no thank you.
You mostly eat out, do you?
I actually put my cat in the fridge when I was really young and didn't know putting a cat in the fridge was bad for small animals
Me too, Noodle.
Me too, Noodle. Me too. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Me too Noodle, me too.
Take your cat out of the fridge. You eat from there, it steps on its own piss/shit daily and you're letting it sit with your food. Nasty, trampy behaviour imo. Putting karma before food hygiene and decency. Disgusting tramps.
[removed]
how much do you weigh op?
Noodle is precious and I love him
I'm jealous, want to live in my fridge as well...
Wait... Is that not normal???

*Deeper existential crisis - moves from fridge to freezer*
r/confusingperspective
That is absolutely disgusting. The cat buries piss and shit with it's feet and you let it get in your fridge with all your fresh food, gross
Greebles, definitely a bomb shelter for greebles
Noodle is one of the most beautiful cats i have ever seen.
My family refers to this as cold weather training
It's easier to stare into the void when there are snacks in it
He is just trying to figure out why there is nothing in the fridge but condiments and drinks.
Don‚Äôt forget them in there!
I have seen so many photos of cats in refrigerators. Is it that their fur makes them hot? Or they want a dark spot? Or the food?

I would actually lay my life down for Noodle to have another sub-room temperature existential crisis.

Is that a Birman? What a beautiful baby. His facial expression is perfect üòÇ
/r/fridgedetective would have fun with this
Oh ! I do this all the time
Waiting for the milk to leak
A cool noodle is a better prepared noodle.
It's not a vad phase for an existential crisis, really.   It's cool, dark (when they leave you alone and close the door) and there's food.
Why is Noodle like this?
Am I the milk now?!?
Me too Noodle, me too.
Makes sense. I tend to have my existential crises in front of the fridge. I'd never really thought about it until now, but if I could fit in the fridge I would definitely have them in the fridge.

Cat reminds me of doc from Back to the Future. ‚ÄúMarty I stole some plutonium from the Libyans!‚Äù

Everyone in the thread: "Look at the cat tripping balls!"  


Me, a Publix associate: "Heh, that's our chocolate milk. Nice."
I love you, Noodle.
Noodle looks like a Muppet, and I mean that as the highest compliment
noodle died. lol.
the name noodle makes this so much better
i mean, don't we all?
I could make a meme out of this

The salad should be in the bottom of the fridge if you don't want it to go bad.

"And there it goes..."
Shit, I need to get some chocolate milk.
I love how dumb and stupid he looks. Probably a smart cat
I have a Siamese that always jumps in the fridge if I leave the door open briefly.

I'd like to think it's cause he wants his namesake to magically appear inside.  Either that or he is waiting for a fresh Schnoodle!
Well his name is noodle
If you just put the cat on the fridge for karma you deserve to be put in the fridge
That's the best place to have an existential crisis.
I think his eyes are frost
Cats are fucking hilarious.  I want one.
My mind can't figure out this picture. On the right side pic, is that a shower curtain where the door would seal?
You left Noodle overnight in the freezer, didn‚Äôt ya?!
Yea, I'd definitely do the same if I fit in there.
OUR CAT IS ALSO NAMED NOODLE!
I am Noodle.
That chocolate milk is so God damn good!
Hey your chocolate milk is expired
i love noodle
Barf
He's probably triggered that there's all this food in the fridge that youve had the audacity to not offer him.
Is he a kitty or is he chocolate milk? He doesn't know!
Hes chillen
Wim Hof method but for cats that don‚Äôt like to get wet lol
I see why , there is a Noodle on the left , but who is that on the right? Noodle ?
My cat is always trying to get in the fridge too! I have to check before I close. Love his name hehe

Whoa... the light says ON!
cats in the fridge, so fucking dumb
And only one post away was a cat in an appliance cabinet. Guess cats are essential for the kitchen.
Cool.
My question is, why is there a fridge in the bathroom?  I mean, that is a shower curtain, is it not?

This cat has seen somethings....
My favorite coffee creamer.
Understandable, understandable

Yes it's perfectly understandable

Comprehensible, Comprehensible

Damn, I haven't had chocolate milk in forever. I should get some chocolate milk.

it's always a crisis when your having cold noodles.
Noodles always gets an upvote from me

How cute! Now close it.
That cat has seen some things...
Or just trying to cool down the crisis.
Lol funny kat
I'd say thats a Cat√® Latt√®.
Oh how i miss publix chocolate milk
Keep an eye on him, the fate of the Dunkin  Donuts Creamer clearly hangs in the balance.
Show this to someone on acid. They‚Äôre gonna have a time
Me too
Cute. Just made my day
Jj
Is it because he‚Äôs a cat named Noodle?
I mean you‚Äôve got chocolate milk, can‚Äôt blame noodle one bit
gotta keep your muppets refrigerated
When I was about three my parents had a party and there were leftovers in the fridge. The next morning they were hungover in bed, the cat was hungry and so I put her in the fridge not knowing what to feed her. I thought I would let her choose what she wanted from all the leftovers. Ironically her name was popsicle toes before the incident. She hated me after that.
Is that Publix brand shredded cheese I see?
... I love Noodle.
same
I love Publix
I guess me and Noodle have a lot in common.
That‚Äôs nasty
The Voices... What do they want.
Might want to throw the Chocolate milk away
im in ur fridge

eatin ur f00dz
Took me a minute to realize the right side picture wasn't the open door of the fridge
O\_O
This is the cutest thing ever ü•∫‚òÅÔ∏è
Cats in the fridge...this is why I dont do work potlucks
r/NamFlashbacks
That's disgusting
Me too, buddy. Me too.
Omg this is perfect haha
I love the apparent lack of facial detail and all I see are eyes on a mound of fur.
So cute and so ew.
Same
That would freak me out to open my fridge to hahaha
I've been that high before!!!
Nice idea I'll try that next time
Honestly, I would've cleared the fridge and sat beside him
A lot of unhealthy food in there lmfao~
69
When the nip kicks in.
Nasty
I thought he was staring to his mini double
Momma I don't want to be cat anymore. I'm milk now
He do be looking like he's seen some things tho
Literal demonstration of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a snacc too‚Äù
noodles' making that face kids make when they see their parents having sex.
That Publix brand chocolate milk tho
I feel like a cat who walks in litter everyday is super gross to see in a fridge.
Those eyes! OMG! Funny!
Aww noodle
I would if I could too
Aww... your chocky  milk expired
Can relate
I used to have existential crises in my old job‚Äôs walk-in fridge so I get it
I like how this person just has stuff to make cold brew and quesadillas and then bought a tub of spinach to feel healthy. This isn't meant to be snarky, I genuinely relate
I'm not entirely convinced that's not a stuffed animal
Publix and my cats name Noodles too <3
Noodles took a shit that smells so bad he had to sit in the fridge with his human slave‚Äôs milk.
The cat be like:

There was probably billions of different species that have walked the face of the earth, and we wouldn‚Äôt know it. Civilization would develop and flourish, but a terrible disaster would wipe all life out. And then it repeats. And to think that a second ago I only cared about that bird in the window.
Slave, I fancy being in the fridge. Don't you DARE shut that door though, lest you curse yourself.
Social distancing, for sure.
Your not supposed to put the noodles on the fridge
Publix chocolate milk is the BEST!
Does air circulate in a closed fridge?
How did you stick the eyes to it? Glue?
As aPublix associate,  my eyes went straight to the milk.  Good choice!
Good choice on the chocolate milk
Isn‚Äôt that where we all go during a crisis?
Am I the only one looking at all the stuff in the fridge?
Man I wish my mom were like this when it came to the fridge. There's space!
Wonderful.  My greatest fear has just materialized. Thanks.
What the hell is publix
Same Noodle.
Awww, this is so cute! XD
That cat has seen some shit !
Cat after my own heart!
Why is there a curtain on your freezer door?

Cute cat.
How the hell is your fridge so empty? Between three kids, a wife and myself our fridge is always full. There‚Äôs not space for a mouse, let alone a whole cat.
That‚Äôs one cool kitten...
Don‚Äôt we all.
 I've been working home office in Brazil for the past 4 months and wish I could fit inside a fridge to have my constant existential crisis.
It looks like your chocolate milk expired a few days  ago üëÄ
Can I hit that chocy milk
Is that a Siberian? Looks just like it.
*closes the door*
I am....I am........the shelf warmer...?
So do I Noodle, so do I.
You're in Florida.  I can tell by the Publix Chocolate milk.
Noodles in the fridge
Cat looks regal AF not gonna lie

When you‚Äôre that majestic? You handle business affairs wherever
This made me laugh so hard! Great post!
"The screams from the cow farms echo in my ears mom."
Thousand island stare.
If no one wants their leftover Noodles I'll take it!! üòÅ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Babe are we outta cat? 


Lemme check . 

Nope we got a full cat in the fridge !
Perhaps that cat could be feeling hot, with that gigantic fur.
Same honestly
One cool cat.
Okay, but what's that curtain in front of the fridge in the photo on the right?!
Same, friend
When you do to much catnip and wake up in the refrigerator
Looks like he's scared of somenthing
He likes the Moo-milk <3
Sounds like night is a line cook.
i love how Noodle is named Noodle
"And if thou gaze long into the fridge, the fridge will also gaze into thee" - Nietzsche, probably
Honestly, I would too.
Is that extra extra creamer any good? Ive almost bought it a couple times. Your cat is the cutest.
Me too Noodle...me too...
Well he is named noodle so it makes sense he would want to be refrigerated üòÜ
Me too, Noodle
He looks like he just saw one of Jake Paul‚Äôs videos
This is me I guess üê±
n00dle!! I had a n00dle, but it was 2D that would get in the fridge.
This cat is adorable
Yuck!
Me too, Noodle. Me too.
Looks like they can see time.
r/2meirl4meirl
Chocolate milk. A being of culture I see.
Who gave Noodles the edibles though?
Man, that cat knows it's a cat and is having trouble with it.
He likes to watch
Is his existential crisis ‚Äòomg should I make a run for it? Are they releasing me from this chilly tomb?!?‚Äô


?
We are all Noodle.
I too have a cat named Noodle, I don‚Äôt keep him in the refrigerator though. Good post op
Get that dog out the fridge man
Best place for an existential crisis!
He looks very fresh.
Cat.  It's what's for dinner.
Chocolate milk... we used to drink that back in 'Nam
"Get out of there Noodle.*  
"Who?"  
"Noodle, get out."  
"Who?"  
"Noodle!"  
"Who."
reddit just loves its cats
Cannot open my fridge door without my cat sneaking up to chew on the little tab that turns the light on and off in the fridge. üôÑ
But why is there a curtain and a litter matt next to the fridge?
You may have left your cat in the fridge a tad too long
Maybe it's noodle, maybe it maybelline.
Same
r/namFlashbacks
Me too.
God I gotta clean my fridge
So do I smh
Meow Hof
Stuffed cat
*Am I a cat dreaming it is a noodle, or a noodle dreaming it is a cat?*
Seems like you live off coffee and quesadillas.
hold my beer
I mean, cold noodles has solved many an existential crisis.
Or maybe he‚Äôs just stoned
What does it all mean and fucking meow I am cold
I feel ya bro
Those eyes ü§£
Fucking same.
Don‚Äôt we all?
noodle
what a fluffy cat
Noodles aren‚Äôt supposed to be stored in the fridge
/r/StartledCats
Only you can teach your cat to say no to drugs.
Same.
The fridge is my go to when I feel an existential crisis coming on...
I see you too are a man of culture, buying publix chocolate milk is the only way my brother.
r/perfectfit
With a name like "noodle" and "existential crisis in the fridge" ... I was expecting a snake having a "time out".
Awww the chocolate milk expired
Reminds me of the scene in Servant.
If I could fit, I‚Äôd do the same.
This cat has seen some shit
Same
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
You gotta make better food decisions
wonder what other small spaces noodle can fit in. you guys think they would fit in a fedex box
I hope Noodle hasn't been outside or chewing on some insect... that's a possible r/eww
Cool cat
I adore Noodle.
What is it with these weirdos letting their cats in the fridge?
What kind of cat is that ?
I‚Äôve been trying to track down that Dunkin creamer for the last 2 months. Stores stopped stocking it. Probably for the better, tbh.
The pace salsa, as far as a jarred salsa goes, is the best.
Yo, your milks expired. Hope you threw it out.
Your chocolate milk expires soon
Me too, buddy.
So unsanitary but I gets down with the Guerrero tortillas - only Riqu√≠simas though
MA! MA! THERE'S A WEIRD FUCKIN' CAT IN THE FRIDGE!
Well how else is one supposed to keep a cool head while freaking out
This is why I don‚Äôt eat homemade food from coworkers.  You never know if they have a pet that goes straight from the litter box to their refrigerator and then jumps on their countertops.  This is disgusting.
i love that i can confidently place your location in the southern US from just one photo
That boy be hepped up on goofballs.
*Close the door human*
You are not prepared for another lock down or any sort of food shortage.
