He is a handsome boy!

Is he named after your role in the Predator?He‚Äôs 10 months-old and already weighs 103 pounds but he is still very terrified of Lulu. I‚Äôm working on his friendship with her and Whiskey.Dutch looking pretty slick and ready to go to TahitiI had the opportunity to meet him when I was a Soldier. He was at Camp Doha in Kuwait for the 4th of July when he was running for governor. I took a picture with him and was on a plane to Iraq hours later. Very friendly guy.


Edit: Oh crap! Sorry Gov. Very cute puppers! I highjacked the thread by reminiscing.At first I was like "wow this dude totally looks like Schwarzenegger... Then I remembered he was a reddit poster and went back to checking OP's username... Its all starting to make sense now :pThanks, governator. 

Mini Arnold story.

When he was campaigning in California he stopped at my town, Tracy, to speak at the mall there. My family was there for an unrelated reason (buying video games..I think Kingdom Hearts 1) and we stopped to watch him speak, but we couldn't get in front with the proper crowd. So we watched him speak from behind However, he had all the television lights in front of him, so all I could see was this giant glowing golden god. And then he became our governor. I was like, 11? It was pretty majestic.You've chosen the best trio. A pony, a donkey and a dog!What‚Äôs wrong with wolfie?Does he have a plan?You son of a bitch!He looks really cool! Though I have some questions

1. Does he have a plan?

2. Does he like mangoes? 

3. Does he have some kind of weird hatred towards any dogs called ‚ÄúAngelo‚Äù or something like that?

4. Does he like tropical islands?

5. Has he ever met an albino stallion?

And 6. Does he always have a sudden need for money?

Btw, keep him away from snowy cliffs, just saying[Dutch should fit right in with Whiskey, Lulu, and Cherry!](https://i.redd.it/d2sagt3o6na41.jpg)That dog looks like he's got a plan.‚ÄúARNOLD - I HAVE A PLAAAAAN

I JUST NEED SOME FAITH‚ÄùGovernor! You're needed in /r/OldSchoolCool!Let's get this to the top. We need Arnold at the top for being 50% old school cool and 50% aww.Jesus people. HES SEEN THE ONE MILLION POSTS TELLING HIM ABOUT THAT DUDE‚ÄôS MOM.

Can we not scare away every high profile person who uses Reddit? He‚Äôs not some show pony who can be summoned at will for memes. Imagine if you were constantly bombarded with requests to talk about a date that happened 30 years ago. 

Have some respect for the dudes privacy and let him use Reddit in peace.Adorable! And the dog is cute too!Hello Mr Schwarzenegger meet my dog Gus https://imgur.com/BqPBO2T he's the best boy ever[deleted]He's got a little plan guys.Hey Arnold, you probally won‚Äôt remember me but once when I was biking through old town Sacramento as a kid,and I saw you and wanted to get a autograph, but it looked like a bunch of people were already bugging you and I didn‚Äôt wanna make you mad so I just yelled ‚ÄúI LOVE YOU, TERMINATOR‚Äù and rode away as fast as I could cuz I was embarrassed
