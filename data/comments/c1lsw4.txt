You should get her a stroller so you can both enjoy the exercise and sunshine daily
Beautiful pup, lucky to have a great owner
She's reminiscing about the old days, when she used to chase the Roadrunner around this very park...
[What a beauty, she's lucky to have such a loving owner.](https://i.imgur.com/ndb8gTv.png)
i love senior dogs, there is a gentleness about them

from when they are puppies up until adulthood they protect us if need be and take care of us.

&#x200B;

literally take a bullet for us.

so the least we can do is take care of them, and carry them if they cant do it on their own in old age anymore.

their little paws cant handle it anymore.

and all they want is some peace and quiet at that age, some pets and kisses.

and even at that age their tail will wag like crazy.

&#x200B;

we dont deserve dogs.

there is nothing on the planet more pure than dogs, and you cannot change my mind on that.

&#x200B;

they will always always love you, no matter what.

and their day brightens up when you get back home.
Lovely dog! Mine was also 15 years old and passed 2 days ago. Enjoy the time with her!
please take me to the park today!

it's where i want to be

i used to love to run n play

together - you n me

just hold me in your arms, my friend

i know the path so well

it's there that i'll lie down again

enjoying every smell

the wildflowers, grass, n trees

the sunshine from above -

i feel the warmth n softest breeze

it fills my heart with love

remember how the park we'd roam -

those days i loved the best!

n now, friend, carry me back home

i'm ready

for my rest
Not a dog owner here - how do you know if she wants to go to the park?
Not just sunshine -- a dog is a nose.  You've given her so many interesting smells to dream about the rest of the day.
Awww sweet doggo.
she looks like she's about to hit you with the meaning of life
‚ù§
She is loving it there ‚ù§Ô∏è
Bless her! That‚Äôs so lovely.
You should get a doggie stroller
My ole lab was like that made it to 13 took her to the park for same reason and she loved having the sun warm her aching bones and it allowed her to stretch out in the tall grass she used to love to run in years earlier seems fitting the Spanish word for sun is Sol because it warms the soul
Random question to /u/pswfreathy do you know what breed she is? It's weird how she's oddly similar to my dog was (passed away a few years). He was a rescue dog (got him when he was 5-7 years old), we were told he was a cross between a german shepherd and an alaskan malamut, but thought you might have more insight. Thanks.
You're a good person
I love your dog
You're the kind of owner every dog deserves, thanks for being awesome !
When my  beagle dog got this old. I got this old, I got him one of those little red wagon's so he could join us on our walks.  It was so worth it.
...how did you know she wanted to go to the park?
Beautiful girl
I fucking love dogs so much I dont even wanna be a person anymore.
Looks like she is experiencing some sort of a flashback in this pic. OMG I'm crying ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
Thank you for sharing she is so beautiful!
Old dogs used to make me sad until I had one myself. I see her loving life and not caring about her grey hair or how old she is. I think I‚Äôm learning how to age gracefully. Your sweet girl looks like a beautiful soul.
Old dogs at parks are great.
She‚Äôs a loviedog.
Honest question: how did you know that specifically wanted to go to the park?

Side note: that's a great love for you dog
Can you please give her a hug and a kiss on the head for me please! She's a doll üòçü•∞üíñ
[deleted]
I read the title and I thought you were referring to your daughter so I was like, why are you carrying her if she's too old to go the park (thinking it was a child's playground).
I have an old dog like yours, and I try to take him to the park as much as possible, because he will not not have many more time, and he deserves all he can get,
My dog passed when he was 18 and I still remember blind from both eyes he loved to just sit outside and smell. Funny story he was sitting outside tied up as required by law on my property (he was about 10 lbs a toy poodle) and a little girl came up to him. When she got close enough for him to smell her he snapped at her. Of course by then he had no teeth and could not pierce a  grape if his life dependent on it.  Someone learnt a valuable lesson that day I should of brush his teeth more.
It's the little things like this that gives me faith in humanity
I love how content she looks. Like she has lived a long and happy life. Lucky to have each other :).
Wait, how do you know she wanted to go to the park?
I‚Äôm curious to know how she told you that she wanted to go to the park.
Okay, Im melting from the cuteness right now
Im fine
How incredibly sweet is this? What a lucky little girl to have such a wonderful parent!
It sucks when they get old.

But it's always beautiful.
Have my upvote, it ain't much but it's honest work
Always love seeing these types of posts. Good for you and you dog! :-)

My dog, a Siberian Husky, turned 15 in March. He‚Äôs still walking on his own, although he hates stairs.
She is beautiful!

&#x200B;

Just a suggestion: I got a bike trailer made by Aosom Elite2 that can handle 180 pounds and I put my dogs dog bed in that and haul her all over on my minibike.
This makes me both happy and a sad at the same time, for some reason. Anyway this dog must have a very good life thanks to his owner! :)
Beautiful dog, she definitely doesn't look 15 years old. I plan on carrying around my dogs when they have trouble walking later on, too. Nice job
A cheap wagon from Home Depot & some pillows and a blankey from home will give you and sweet doggie many more wonderful memories in the days to come.
Such a serene, happy girl.
Enjoy every second man, my best friend had to be put down a few weeks ago... \*big man cries\*
Such a beautiful dog. Enjoy your friend!
Dogs should live forever.
angels come in dog form
Your little girl looks exactly like my little girl

Edit: well perhaps you can't see it in this pic but when I saw OP's little girl I thought it was a pic of my dog :)
Soak it up! I got my doggo in a bike trailer and he loves it. Wonderful creatures!
I'm a pretty emotionally dead person but all these damn posts have my eyes watering.  Memories of old friends.
You should get her a little fold-up cart at Walmart for $50.  She'd love it and you can pack her on any trail that's not too hilly.
Enjoying the sunshine... in the shade.
Beautiful pup!  ‚ô•  She looks so well loved.
This is how my old girl sits in our yard on sunny days
75640/10 good girl
I love this! So glad you guys have each other‚ù§Ô∏è
That‚Äôs one happy dog. Bless her.
A wagon or stroller is helpful
What breed is she? She looks a bit like a vallhund but it‚Äôs hard to be sure
I read the text without looking at the picture and wondered why a 15 year old is too old to walk
r/humansbeingbros
r/oldmandog
I am the unofficial goodest boi but she is the official goodest girl
Just lost my 15 year best boy last week. You are a good human. What I would give for us both to have just one more day in the park
Das a coyote
I am 100% certain that I speak for most people on here when I say that we love her to bit, too.
She's just so beautiful <3
She appears to be in heaven. God love you and her to pieces.
I remember the last full walk I took with my Lobo. We were jogging and he started slowing down and his back legs collapsed. I just laid there with him until he felt like he could get back up and we slowly walked home. Few weeks later he was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Beautiful black lab German Shepherd mix.. this is heartwarming to look at.
I do the same with my 15 year old pug too. Kudos to you!
I‚Äôm crying about your old doggo. Good for you!
She is so beautiful!! She reminds me of my old girl who I lost when a relationship ended ... she would have been 14 now & I loved her so much! Sending your baby all the love!
My dog is my bff, he turns 5 this year and I can see when he walks..  even though his muscles are big and strong, his knees don't look as strong as they used to walking up the stairs. It scares me so bad to think about him getting older. Hopefully when he's 15 he still enjoys a nice hike.
100k damn
What a beautiful little girl! It's sad when they get that old but think of all thememories you guys have together . And you both know you've made each other happy
Thank you for doing this for her üíú
Oh my gosh! She is so gorgeous! I wish dogs lived for 50 years üò®üò¢üò≠
Bless you both for the love that you share.  May she give you more years of love, devotion & happiness.
The picture didnt load and i was very confused
Probably should have put her in the sun then if she was enjoying it.

&#x200B;

^(This is a joke, hope you two had fun!)
Kisses to your beautiful girly!
You are a kind person, I can tell.  Bless you and your little girl.  Hope there are more days like the one shown in the pic.
Didn‚Äôt you just post this yesterday? Milking that karma a little hard huh?
>This is how she enjoyed the sunshine.

**Is literally in the shade >:(**
She‚Äôs in the shade...
Two things...  First, she looks happy as hell.  Second, you are a wonderful human being.
What a good girlüòç
She looks like a coyote! üòÅ
You sure that's not a coyote you dumb fuck? Put the bitch down.
Beautiful lady and beautiful picture!  I also recommend a stroller to take her out, she deserves all the outs she can have.
This has gotta be one of the most wholesome things on here üòç
Old dogs are the best
Awwww she's so lovely!!
What a cutie! What kind of doggo?
She looks like she's reminiscing.
I love old doggos!
Beautiful girl!
I love her to bits too.
Right in the feels!!
What a beautiful girl! Good human!
What a good girl. Hip issues?
So much love in your post! She looks great üíú
Good puppy. She looks happy and at peace, like she's had a good life.
Love this so much xx
Well, ok. So I cried today.
Very sweet, thanks for posting -snif- I don't mind crying, I bet this good girl deserves every single reddit tear.
Maybe a Dutch cargo bike, then she can get the breeze in her face
Wish her 15 more years. Such a good girl.
Sweet old lady.
Did she tell you she wanted to go to the park...?
so she sat like a dog?
Aw
Vastgotaspets?
How does one know when there does wants to go to the park?
She's smelling the smells
Aww
She's adorable.
She can't walk? Awww :( Maybe get her a stroller or something like that
Sunshine and pee-mail :)
I have the twin to your puppy mine is 9, not sure if my ex kept her I got the Pekanese when we split
nice animels
she's beautiful :)
She‚Äôs beautiful.
üòä
Little wolfie.
She is absolutely lovely =]
Good girl. Such a sweet smile
She's got a lot of character showing in how she's enjoying the sun in her old age. She's a gorgeous old lady
Oh my, what a beautiful Duwang.
This reminds me of Marley and me.
Please, give her a huge hug and a big kiss for me.
I know, this is Redd it but...I love her. Lol üòç
The image wasn't loading so I thought OP was talking about a daughter.
Why do all old beings seem so full of wisdom, and peace.
I wonder what I am going to do with my 90lb German Shepherd when she can‚Äôt walk anymore. Anyone have ideas?

I am thinking a  fold up canvas wagon might work
I love her too!
My dog is getting that age too kinda sad but she seems ok with it
So cute
Thought you meant your daughter. My data isn‚Äôt working well so the photo didn‚Äôt load for a few minutes.

Sat here trying to understand why you carried your 15yo daughter!
You sir get a fucking updoot. Love it, enjoy it, bask in it like the puppy basks in sunshine.
Try a stroller or a dog bed! Our senior dog can‚Äôt walk long distances anymore, but still loves going on our walks in the stroller!
Good girl
You are breathtaking
Goodest girl!
Ahhh such a happy dog, we saw a lady at the park with a little red cart for her older dog a D she pulled it along and the younger dog trotted alongside.
"Chaos.... reigns..."
The best girl there ever was üòä
Now this is wholesome
That's such a sweet picture.
Happy pupper.
That‚Äôs really nice
This is precious. This pup deserves all the love in the world
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying
Aww what a princess üå∫
You should try giving her bludog CBD oil. Just put it on a treat once daily. My dog Yukon went from the assisted walkimg sling to walking without pain for 2 years now!!!
Aww.. Majestic AF.
Give her lots of love and pets! They‚Äôre gone to soon from our lives, but never from our hearts!
/u/pswfreathy you might like / get emotional with this great Sparklehorse (w/Tom Waits) song [about an old dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snssa2enfDE)
Best token, invest all
being totally dramatic but i would die for her.
Awww She looks so happy! My 17 year old pup gets carried on walks with his younger siblings. I need to find a better way though, he gets heavy. haha
I'm certain she loves you just as much. Such a beautiful dog.
This is just the cutest, old dogs are my favorite. I was just thinking yesterday how they finished renovating a park near my apt and I wished so hard my dog were still here so I could take her, she would love it. Give your dog extra snugs for me!!
Oh Jesus I was not ready for those feels.
I can't even describe how much I love this . She is a beauty.
what a wonderful photo and memory you have here. She looks so comfy and happy; well done you for helping her feel that way. I hope you have lots more time and good memories together.
Watching her enjoying it brings tears to my eyes as my dog just died a couple of days ago
I absolutely love people, pet's too) who appreciate sinple pleasures like this.
What a sweet baby girl. I hope she enjoys many more years with you, basking in the warm sunshine.
Smell the flowers and feel the sun sweet doggie.
Welp. Knew better than to read this whole thread at work this morning
I love you.
Looks like a sweet girl!
So cute!
‚ù§
Very nice dogüê∂ Does your dog perform commands?
Gorgeous girl. I used to take my old jrt out with me in a back pack. Had it strapped high up so he could rest his head on my shoulder and see where we were going. Got to make the most of those last couple of months. Miss all my old dogs but I've got hopefully many more years with the two loonies (jrt -5 and whippet-4) I've got now.
OP, what have you fed her?  And if you also don't mind, what was her activity regimen like?

Beautiful long-lifed pupper you've got there!
How did you know she wanted to go to the park?
You sure she's not a wolf?
My old lady is about 13 and she‚Äôs getting to the point where it‚Äôs hard for her to tear through the park like she used to but she sure does love the be out in the woods and sunshine
Fucking hell this got me.

My cold icy heart is dripping.
Love herüòç
Now I want to cry
She is so beautiful please give her a nice big hug from me and my son üòÅ
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying
Majestic
This touched me. Enjoy your time with her. You are both beautiful. I‚Äôm tired so kinda mushy right now. üíï
Buy one of those $50 collapsible wagons if you can, I‚Äôm sure going on the walk with you would really make her happy
Good human.
so sweet
Used radio flyer wagon! Check Craigslist. I got one for $20!
‚ù§Ô∏è
<3
I'm glad this special little lady has people who love her so much. She deserves it
I know how this is :( beautiful post. Give her some love from this internet stranger :)
Thank you so much for sharing! We need these kind of stories in our lives.
God damnit I love dogs
What an angel. ‚ù§
Ooh that got me right where I live... Beautiful moment!
Your sweet, good little girl is beautiful.
This is why I can‚Äôt own a pet. My dog as a kid got hit by a car. I had to pick him up off the road and burry him. Fuck if I‚Äôm ever going through that pain ever again.
I had no idea you were talking about the dog, I was picturing a little girl. I was so confused
I love her colours.  She looks like a fox
I nominate this for post of the year.
Wholesome AF!!!!
That is one of the most beautiful older dogs I have ever seen. She aged like a fine Jennifer Aniston.
Get a stroller so you can take her everywhere.
She looks adorable!
sitting in the shade btw, still wholesome af
She's Beautiful ! üåº
She so cuteee good girls
beautiful girlüíû
I wish dogs and cats would live 2x as long :'(
Blue heeler/border collie? I bet she used to run like crazy at the park
I had a childhood dog, circumstances changed and I didn't see her for like 9 years. She was nineteen, had severe arthritis. I walked through the door and she remember me, ran across the yard and jumped on me immediately. 

She passed away a couple of days later.
I‚Äôm totally crying. üò≠ she‚Äôs so beautiful and has an amazing dog parent. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Looks like a coyote
Real owner right there
good pup seems to love the sunshine :)
Damn I wish my dog 17.5 years old could still see, hear and walk. Enjoy this time while you can!
I hate that dogs don‚Äôt live that long. Breaks my heart that I only was able to spend a short time with my previous dog and my current dog is almost 7 and she‚Äôs a large breed so I don‚Äôt even have a decade left with her.
My dog, who is about 4 does this. Although she can walk, she just sits in the park and breathes in the fresh air. What a cutie yours is tho!
My dog turned 18 last month; best puppets in the world.  Known her my whole life easily my closest friend.

This makes me warm hearted ‚ù§Ô∏è
Nice to see a "wolf corgi" now and again! Our oldest died an 19. She had a full life and died whad she loved doing - hiding a bone :)
Might I suggest a bike trolley. My old lady loved rides in them
How did she let you know where she wanted to go? Or did you just know...
Love that she has such a great owner to take care of her!
Sweet girl!!!
Aww, greygirl looks so damn happy and content
Old puppers will always be young inside
Love here too! Such a beautiful dog!
Omg she looks so much like my pupperino. I hope my baby is this happy when she is 15 :D
amazing.
That really nice. Have a nice day :)
Sweet pup.

There‚Äôs this lady that lives on my street and her dog is also having some pain walking, but she has a wagon you would pull kids in and she  puts her dog in with some blankets for walks.
Give her an extra hug for me.
And she passed?
‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ÄúTake me the fuck home.  I‚Äôm fucking old‚Äù
She's the best.  I love her.
What kind of dog is this?
Sweetness
Amazing take care of her
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
Aww
She's a treasure
I truly melt, by seeeing this pucture, thanks
She's beautiful. She reminds me of my childhood dog who was a German shepherd/collie cross.
Awww! too cute!
That‚Äôs a great idea about the stroller!!!
She is marvelous!
How many would be willing to have their life force drained to allow dogs to live longer?
 this is already buried but I'm so curious what kind of dog she is? I love the coloring and the very fox like features.
Is that a wolf?
I've said before OP, we don't deserve dogs, but you might.
I have a 14 yo Golden that‚Äôs 115lb, can‚Äôt do stairs for shit anymore and it‚Äôs heartbreaking. This post made me happy tho
She's gorgeous
Beautiful ... you are a good human!
Awe that‚Äôs so sweet!
What a beautiful angel.
Aw, she looks so happy.
That is just really wonderful. ‚ù§Ô∏è
This warms my heart and hurts a little too. They gave us their youth and now it‚Äôs our turn to take care of them.
i want to hug her
My dog Mugs needed help to get off a hardwood floor in his 21st year. Still could do stairs at his own odd two paws at a time per stair pace. He loved sitting in the sun in the yard. Would sunbathe for hours at a time. His fat butt left a dent in the grass in summer. I was devastated when I realized the grass was mowed and grew out and he wasn‚Äôt there anymore to leave his butt print anymore.
So sweet. Treasure her.
She is gorgeous by the way. Nothing better than a wonderful aged pooch that knows it's life was made beautiful by your caring hand.
r/dogsenjoyingnature
And she loved every second of it
Mine lost a leg 2 years ago. I use to carry her daily when she gets tired. She's lovely
Arthritic drugs are always an option to keep your wonderful companion more comfortable üôÇ
Aww love her to bits for me!
How did you know she wanted to go to the park??
I don‚Äôt know you but I love you!!   This is such a beautiful thing to do for your baby.
omg she looks so happy
Reminds me of my pupper üò≠ make sure you make the most of your time with her
Get her some cbd. Really helped my girlfriends 15 year old dog.
Take lots of pictures now when you still can and back them up you will never know what will happen to your phone/camera
What dog is this?
Why am I crying in the club rn
So cute and you‚Äôre a great hooman
Very good
r/OldManDog
You are a beautiful girl, regal wee dog.
My cousin got a dog stroller for her blind, elderly dog and brings her everywhere üíì Ari loves to feel the wind on her face and experience all the new smells.
I had an American Eskimo that lived to be 22 years old. She was very active up until her last 6 months. But my heart goes out to all those who help their senior dogs live happy in their golden years.
She is a very beautiful doggy and she looks like she is a sweetheart too.  I hope you two have many more wonderful years together
I'm so happy when I see older dogs. They're so adorable. And what you did for her is amazing.

My little boy who was 13 years old passed away two months ago. I was so sad from that, like absolutely destroyed. We got a new puppy, even with the same name, so it hurts way less now. But it still hurts, especially when I see his grave.

I'm happy for you and for your little girl, dogs are just amazing.
thanks guys you made cry in this thread ;(
I absolutely love and hate posts like this. Love them because of how good people treat their fur friend. Hate them because it always makes me think of my 1 year old pup getting that old and losing her. Hate you reddit üò¢
we should all give this dog one year of our lifespan to make her eternal
is my eyes bad or the camera or my fcking network?
Awwwww, she is gorgeous.
Her flower looks nice.
Omg üò¢‚ù§Ô∏èüê∂
I love seeing posts like this! Thank you for sharing üòä
I have a dog stroller for the same reason. It has opened new worlds for my dog. So for example, it‚Äôs a 1,000 meters to the beach. I can‚Äôt carry her that far. She can‚Äôt walk that far. But she LOVES the beach. 

Enter dog stroller. I have the one with the big inflatable wheels and that‚Äôs key. Whenever I get out the stroller, she goes nuts!!  

She knows that‚Äôs her chariot to the beach. 

I highly recommend.
I was confused for a hot minute by 'little girl'. Like "too old so I had to carry her...?" hmmm
How do you know she wanted to go to the park? Did she tell you?
This is so adorable and pure
That's a wolf.
She is beautiful!
You have to give your girl a boop for every upvote.

It‚Äôs the law.
happy and beautiful pupper - they are always puppers to us no matter their age XOXOXOXOX
My boyfriends dog sits just like that to bask in the sun, I think it‚Äôs so sweet.
Would someone kindly enlighten me on what the wonderful breed of this cute doggo may be?
:)
And on the wind doth play a melody meant only for her.... what an angel you have there
It's the little things in life that make us the happiest. She is adorable!
You‚Äôre going to make me cry, dog
What a good girl. It's is great that you took her to enjoy the day like that. These are the actions to you will be thankful for when she is no longer around.
Im not crying youre crying!
Smol sunshine wolf.
Absolutely beautiful =)
A friend from the start to the end.
Been on vacation for the past week and won‚Äôt see my 1 year old pup until tonight. This is beautiful and makes me so excited to see him
Aawwwwww
This just makes me wanna hug my dog aand stay home today

What a lovely creature
Like a doggy yoda..so cute yet wise..

How did you know she wanted to go to the park?
In the shade but still cute
You are awesome.
No that's a wolf
One with nature
Proud pupper do a happ.
What a beautiful girl . Live long !
Oh my goodness she's beautiful
Old dogs are truly the greatest creatures.
reminds me of my 16 year old pup
My cat is 19 and I do the same for her! No one wants to stay in the house forever. I‚Äôve gotten her a stroller and she loves going on rides. My kitty also takes cbd oil from innovet pet. It has done miracles helping her walk, she even went up and down the stairs now and then. Hope your pup gets more sunshine :)
What a precious pup!
I love this. I recently celebrated one year of my old bird moving on to the next chapter in her life. Had her for 17 years and 11 months. Most enriching experience of my life. I can never forget watching her hair go from jet black to salt and pepper.
Love n miss you Precious.

Goddamn dude. I both didn't need to see this today and it's also the best thing I've seen in a while. Good girl!!
Awww what a sweet girl!!!
Everyone likes to talk about tiny young puppies, but old dogs are so adorable too. Something about the sprinkling of grey hairs on the face and the paws is just great.
Precious - my family just had to put down our 14 yr old German Short-haired Pointer, but she got a few good days at the beach first.
A-fucking-dorable.

Made my eyes sweat a little...
My dog is 13... so hard to watch them get old.
She‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous
I'm not crying, You're crying!
I immediately thought ‚Äúbless her heart‚Äù‚ù§Ô∏è and got reminded to take my dogs out for the little bit of sunshine London has today
well, i‚Äôm now crying while i hide in the bathroom. strong start to the week.
Beautiful girl.

May she be in the sunshine always.

‚òÄÔ∏èüåºüåø
What a good girl x
I'm not crying, you're crying.
Beautiful little girl you got there. My Izzy Bear is 16 and while she's not blind or deaf, she's become extremely hard headed, which at this point, I think she has the right to be! She's my beautiful puppy, and she'll always be. üê∂üòäüê∂
Man she looks bigger in this pic. Just saw the one with your cat. Thought she was at least 50 pounds but prob more like 15 right? Such a cutie.
Curious how do you know she wants to go to the park...
Perfection
Costco sells stuff called "Cosequin" sp?  It works really well for my mom's dog who's getting old.
I see old pup I click like
There's a lady in our neighborhood who walks her dog in a baby stroller. He can't walk much because of congestive heart failure. But she can take him out to do his business; she gets some exercise; and he gets to enjoy the scenery and fresh air.
what a sweet face!
It‚Äôs the saddest thing to see your pets getting old. My boys are 14 and 12.5. The 14 yrs old has health issues so he probably won‚Äôt last much longer. I worry everyday about losing them. We do everything for them to enjoy every single day.
Such a cute coyote looking pupper
Oh God, this is SO CUTE
Well finally someone who lets their old dog live.
‚ù§Ô∏è
Omgosh, she‚Äôs gorgeous <3
:'(
My pupper-doo has hip issues. She is still young, but she is a biiig dog so the problems could advance quickly. I am planning on buying/building a bike trailer to take her to her favorite spots. She deserves it.
This is absolutely beautiful! I'm so glad she had a nice day!! üòÄüòÄ What a wonderful pup!
That's so cute
I know EVERYONE would love to see their pup make it to 15 years old and enjoy tanning like that.
When people refer to animals in a way that makes them sound like a human, they sound like an pretentious entitled asshat. ‚ÄúOh my little girl...‚Äù It‚Äôs a fuckin dog! Say ‚Äúmy dog...‚Äù  

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a mom because this dog is a baby.‚Äù Nope, you‚Äôre just a piece of shit, and it‚Äôs a good thing you don‚Äôt have real human babies.

Dogs are awesome and can be referred to honorably by there title. No need to pretend they are human, they got their own great thing going.

God bless you , what a beautiful gesture!Lucky dog to have such a caring owner!I I have a 15 year old Peke that I put in a stroller so that the whole family can have outings.
OMG give her hugs and kisses for me
This is a good thing that cleansed me after seeing the furry fandom scar me again. Thank you.
üò≠ What a sweet girl!
My pup is getting old and struggling on walks now too. I guess I'm carrying his big ol butt to the park!
This reminds me of when our beagle tore both of her ACLs. We got her braces to help her be able to walk and heal but she wouldn't wear them. So for 6 months we carried her to all of her usual spots; to her food, potty, whatever room we were going to be in for a more than a few minutes and **I think most importantly for her, her spot in the sun in the back yard.** 

She always had the same look on her face as your beautiful girl.
She is a lucky girl to have a great friend in you.
Beautiful!  My boy is 15 and he‚Äôs got lots of mobility issues, but we loves to be in the sunshine!  Enjoy your day with that sweet pupper.
This makes me miss my dog :/. She was 4 years young when she passed this May.
Enjoy these days as if they will be your last. I still wish to this day, almost 10 years, later to have just one more day with my little girl. I had 16 years with her and it still wasn't enough.
üò¢üò¢‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§so GLAD she is loved...
She's posing! üòä thanks for sharing and giving me an extra smile for today!
My guy is coming up on 13 I hope he stays good enough for walks but I'd be more than happy to carry him
I also love this person's dog to bits
I have two big pups that are 10 and it makes me sad that one day they won‚Äôt be here. It‚Äôs crazy because we‚Äôve had them since I was 4 and they‚Äôve seen my grow up. Dogs are the best
Well you could just take her in the backyard
Thank you for your kindness to her. if you do eventually put her down (god forbid), please hold her and do NOT leave her alone in her last moments
That's the facial expression I wish for all of us when we become old.
What‚Äôs her name?! üòçüíï
Omg!!! That‚Äôs so stinkin‚Äô sweet of you!
My kitty is 14 and she's scared stiff if I take her anywhere outside. The minute her feet touch something that isn't carpet she freaks out.
Probably such good sniffs around there. Just let her move at her pace when she wants to walk. Maybe a wagon if she gets tired. 

Beautiful girl ‚ù§Ô∏è
She is so cute
<3
I find old dogs cuter than puppies, their grey faces express so much patience and wisdom. She‚Äôs a lucky girl to have such a caring guardian to carry her around. Bravo to you!
She‚Äôs probably like put me down you bitch I can walk
>enjoying the sunshine

Yeah but she‚Äôs in the shade
The old ones can't help tugging at your heartüíìüíìüíì
So beautiful.  She knows how much you love her
Bless you!!!!
I recently had to move my 13 year old cat to indoors full time because of her age and because we moved. Today she was in a good enough mood to let me put a leash on her and we walked around our rental's yard letting her enjoy the sunshine and hunt some bugs.
Reading the title before seeing the picture or sub was really confusing at first
pet insurance seems cool.
You are a good human ‚ô°
She is a beauty.
Beautiful girl
Dog looks like coyote
Great story.
We dont deserve dogs
I'm gonna cry. My baby is only 3.5 tho.
Is that like a UK thing to say. Love her to bits?
Crikey! So majestic
She's so beautiful
I agree, they're too heavenly for us
Beautiful girl ‚ù§
She's just lovely. Your an awesome fur baby parent. Easy to go!
My dog is 10 and i hate the idea of her getting that old :( imma have to buy her a stroller. But, we live on the 3rd floor and she's 60+ lbs. Any ideas?
