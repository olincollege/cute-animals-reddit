The way he gently goes to hold the guy's hand.... Awwww
The afterthought fist bump. “Oh ya, I need to do this to keep you happy.”
Interesting behavioral detail:

  When offering the hand to the chimp the guy does so with the palm upward, between apes that's a sign of submission and the chimps accept it by stroking the palm with the fingertips.

This chimp considers this human a superior in hierarchy and holds his hand from under to show so.


Edit:

Thanks for the gold and silver, so far this is my most upvoted comment with difference.

As some of you have requested [here](http://center-for-nonverbal-studies.org/htdocs/10301.html) is a source, more specifically in the point 6.2 says: 

' [...]  Similar palm-up signals have been studied in great apes. Chimpanzees (Pan paniscus and P. troglodytes) use palm-up signs to beg for food, invite bodily contact, and request aid during conflicts with other chimps. [...] '
The fist bump at the end killed me
No tail bro

He an ape
[deleted]
Man he must’ve  developed a very strong relationship with this guy in order to do that. I always think of that woman on the east coast who had her face ripped off... gives you kind of a reality check when working with these animals
ChimpanzeeBro
r/animalsbeingbros
I was awwwing until the fist bump. That part was awesome 😂
Ape, not monkey 🙊
Jaime, pull that vid up of the guy getting lifted by the chimp
Chimpanzees are on another level when it comes to strength
Chimpanzees are not monkeys.
That's adorable.
This the start of the planet of the apes
I don't know how videos like this can exist and there are still people who don't believe in the truth of evolution. That is a video of two incredibly intelligent, incredibly dextrous animals that are barely any different than one another. It is absolutely stunning how similar chimps are to human beings and how well they seem to understand how we try to communicate with them.
don't let the librarian hear you call an ape a monkey
That's a chimpanzee which is a primate and a member of the great apes (as are we). We share ~95-98% of our DNA with chimpanzees. 

Other great apes include: gorillas, bonobos, gibbons, humans, and orangutans. We are larger in size, lack tails, have larger brains, and are among the most intelligent creatures on the planet. We are all genetically and morphologically VERY similar. 

Monkeys are also primates, but are more distantly related. They tend to be smaller, have tails, and correspondingly smaller brains. 


Just want to make that distinction: monkeys and apes are both primates, but they are otherwise very different.

Edit: forgot an Oxford comma.
Not monkey. Ape. Monkeys have tails. Cool vid tho.
“Jamie, pull up that video of that one dude fist bumping that chimp... yeah, that one, no, scroll up, yeah — watch this” ... “you see that?!? Fuuuuck! What are you doing, man?!? That thing could rip you face right off! One swoop. That’s all it takes. It’s a killing machine. Seriously. No, for real, you ever seen that photo of the shaved ape? Jamie, Jamie pull up that picture of the shaved ape”.
Honestly, either that camera work was really impressive, or the chimpanzee was really strong... or both.

Actually, I really just wanna see how this was filmed.... it's like too steady
The look in his eyes... so kind.
Chimps are scary as fuck, build like a tank and can rip anyone to shreds
Jamie, pull up some videos of chimps helping people out.
That fist bump though.
That ape's name is Sugriva and the guy is Kody Antle..

Check out his Instagram @kodyantle
Monkeys are insanely strong. The way he scaled that with ease blows my mind.
Umm this is amazing
The fucking fist bump at the end 😭
Stronk boi
#OH MY GOD I WANT ONE


but not really.  They’re too special to be held captive.
Going from 1 hand to 2 hands is awesome
That lion in the background
It’s insane how strong they are. That was nothing to him and there was hardly any leverage either.
no tail, not monkey
That fistbump at the end got me good

I love the connection between apes and humans. I feel like "owning" an ape makes you feel more like equals
Apes together strong

Awe I want to hold a chimps hand
This is the best.
That fist bump tho
Damn.. that's got to be the coolest fistbump I've seen!!
This might be the best gif on the internet
Chimps are scary yet adorable at the same time
This reminds me of being kidnapped and held hostage by a wild orangutan in Sumatra. My guide had to give her fruit to release me but as Jackie the orangutan pulled me deeper into the forest she was always holding my hand and guiding me along. I remember a push on the ass to help get me over a huge fallen log. ♥️

That’s one funky monkey
Just look at how delicately he grabs his wrist.
I woke up about ten minute ago. This video made my whole day.
yo props to that monkey for helpin this dude out
r/likeus
I want to know where they were going
Holy shit that chimp is strong!
It’s all fun and games until he tears you limb from limb
That fist bump tho
He holds the dude's hand in such a classy way.
oh my goooshhh this is so cute
the beginning looks like the typical instagram post
When he used both his hands and finished with a fist bump I was like "Holy shit!?"
A show I was watching one time said that Chimpanzee's are about 8 times as strong as a human being.
That fist bump at the end 🔥🔥🔥😎
It's so humbling to think that these guys are what we used to be, it's even more so because these guys recently hit there own version of the stone age. It's so interesting to see evalution happening right before our eyes.
That fist bump...
liked the touching fists pose 👨‍❤️‍👨👨‍❤️‍👨👨‍❤️‍👨
[deleted]
Holy FUCK that chimp is strong...

Jamie, pull up that clip.
It always blows me away to see how strong chimps are. It’s evidence that there’s a world of difference between being buff and being strong.
That fist bump at the end tho
The fist bump at the end XD
Welp...this is probably the best video I'll see this week. That ape is a total broski. Love it.
Literally the next fucking level.
The fist bump at the end is adorable
This is so fucking cute. Why do all animals have to be so cute😭
Ok so basically wholesome monky
that's not a monkey. it's also not a dog, a turtle, or an orca. it's an ape.

please don't reinforce this error
Dude, a chimp is an ape, not a monkey.
Just went “awwwww”
This fills me with delight.
I don't know why but this fits perfectly in a cutscene of a FarCry game.
Yeah that’s not a monkey though.
Chimpanzees are apes, not monkeys.
*long live the king*
Im drank rigt niw an totlly frel like my moeg beah hellped me out
What a cute friendship
i am in tears what a beautiful boy
That is an ape.
People don’t realise how dexterous and strong chimpanzees are
\+10 for the fistbump
That bumpfist at the end <3
It only takes one bad day to turn from this to planet of the apes. OPEN YOUR EYES PEOPLE!!!! THE REVOLUTION IS UPON US!!!
Bruh, that fist bump.
The song two worlds by phil collins started playing in my head when I saw this.
[deleted]
Chimps probably wondering " why doesn't he just use the steps on the other side?"
Wow. The fact that a primate this size can pull an adult male up this is amazing
Chimps are apes
That’s not a monkey.
How exactly are their muscles packed? How can something so small be so strong?....
I couldn't stop my "aww" at the fist bump
It’s all fun and games until the little guy eats your face. Chimps are brutal canabals
Dude this is awesome to watch
Cutest fucking thing ever
 But... that’s not a monkey
My dream life.
People don’t realize how strong these bad boys are.
That’s so cool
That fist bumb is the best thing ever.
aw man i love monkeys. they’re such a cool animal and its crazy how they are similar to us in many ways
Chimps are fucking strong btw
That tiny primate just picked up a giant one, I am now more concerned about the planet of the apes.
Omg I love monkey bro
The frightening thing is knowing that arm could be ripped off with so much ease by the monkey
Sir take your hand off my monkey
Chimps are actually REALLY strong.
This reminds me of the story about a scientist who was lost in the jungle at night and was aided by a friendly orangutan. Snap Judgement made a segment on it. Definitely worth a listen.

link: https://www.npr.org/2014/11/14/363895893/a-flash-of-orange
\*Apebro, but still awesome.
The enormous strength of that being is crazy. Pulled you up with only your legs as the other point of leverage
Whats the story behind this? How does one get this interaction with a monkey?
The chimp is like put the fucking phone down and i wont have to work so hard
*Apebro
Hmm? Oh yahh I got you....shit gonna need 2 hands for this
I wish I had a monkey-friend.
“Stop pointing that rock at me and put some effort into helping me lift you.” ~ Ape
All fun and games until he decides to wear your face by snatching it off your skull with his monkey strength
That fist bump got me laughing like an idiot on a public bus.
where can i find a bro like this?
"huh? Oh yeah" *fistbump*
That boi strong af
They are so strong that they can crush your arm.
I love everything about this!
such amazing beings
The Monkey has been hitting those monkey bars.
That was a true brofist
Can your girl friend do that?
Two monkeys holding hands. So cute <3
I was born in 92' 

year of the monkey. I have always wanted to hang out with an ape. They're so fucking smart and cool and funny looking.
Hopefully he won’t bite your face and fingers off anytime soon
This monkey is cooler than some people I know
Everyone liked that
what a lad
"Jamie pull that video up of the monkey ripping this dudes penis off"
I don’t care how strong that chimp was, there’s simply no way it lifted a very large man up onto that platform without raising its one arm above horizontal. It was pulling him forward, some other force was lifting him up.
I love that the chimp positioned his hand underneath the guy's upreached hand because he knew it would be easier to pull him up that way. That's some cooperative thinking right there.
He is a 9 year old
Bruh
Chimps and such are cute af but they still scare me. He'd rip my penis off if he loses his mind for like a minute.
I love this. That chimp might not know what the fistbump means, but he's being a real bro.
Cute video but mostly I'm hoping my Cake Day starts soon!  Sept 2nd and for some reason it feels special this time.

YAHOO!  I missed last year, lol.

APES AREN’T MONKEYS
Looks like you found your long distance cousin
Not a monkey.
Dude that made me feel warm and happy
I'm sure it's been said, but that's not a monkey.
Chimp bro. Give the great apes their due.
Ape... Not monkey.
*Apebro
This video just oozes cool!
this is great
That's an ape bro.
If Planet of the Apes has taught me anything, its that Apes hate being called monkeys.
Sadly I’ve seen too many videos about chimpanzees (including those raised by humans from birth) ripping people’s noses, lips, ears and fingers off with their bare hands to find them adorable. I wish I could see them as cute, but damn I’m afraid of them.
Monkeys are so human it’s crazy. And wickedly strong
Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey!!
That's a chimpanzee you fuck
“Oh yeah, don’t worry about it bro. You know I gotchu anytime.” -Chimp
WTF HOW SMART ARE MONKEYS? NOT ONLY DID IT UNDERSTAND TO HELP YOU UP, IT EVEN KNEW WHAT A BROFIST IS
*sigh*
I wish that every monkey was like that. It would be so fucking fun.
Primates are fucking dope. Gorillas can communicate with the fluency of a small child through sign language, and this guy’s just an all around bro to his human friend.
awwww that little fist bump at the end was cute as fuck and i love how the monkey did a double take
The insane part is just how strong they are compared to us...
Aren’t monkeys really strong? Did the monkey actually help the dude up? Or is this just the sort of thing where OP is just playfully pretending the monkey is helping? I honestly don’t know and am curious. Could a monkey pull a dude up like that?
That's not a monkey .
Chimps are fucking terrifying when you piss them off, they may look nice and cute when they are tame but they are ridiculously strong and violent, there was a women in connecticut who got her face and hands ripped off by a chimp. Id rather be locked in a cage with a bear than a chimp
NOT a monkey.  It’s an ape.  A world of difference.  These things matter.
I've herd they are 3 to 5 times stronger than the average Male...  I've herd horror stories keepers have had their limbs torn off.
#notamonkey
The brofist at the end made it so much better. Monkeys be smart. Damn
This is my new favorite thing
His “try” face is so cute
awwww what the fuuuuck, that was so fun and happy but so Bro-dy. This is good to me
He lift you up like a pillow lmao
This is the best thing today!!!

Thats no monkey.
The little fist bump has made my day 👊🏻
I'm speechless. This "help" is more compassionate than most humans I see everyday. Mother Earth's creatures just blow my mind.
“Here’s the sex chamber I told you about...”
So... I was walking a round, yeah? And then I see this bloke following around a strange little monkey fella. 

Karl, what's wrong with a man following a-a-a monkey?

Yeah, but the weird thing was right, the monkey was holding the bloke's hand, then they climbed a house or something like that.

That's absolute bollucks, none of that is true.
I love this.
Ape.. not monkey.
My lifelong dream is to be friends with a primate and have him help pull me up onto something.
Ape, not monkey.  Lucky it's not the librarian.
@kodyantle on Instagram if anyone’s interested. He has all kinds of awesome videos like this with monkeys, tigers, elephants etc.
The lion roaring in the background at the end means this is probably at a "sanctuary."
That's my fucking guy right there! Monkeybro is my bro. Monkeybro2020
I’m totally digging the lion chuffing in the background at the end
So good I’ve followed six cross posts to upvote each one
That was amazing ❤
Bro! Where is he taking you? I need to see this adventure!
*arm rips off*
Those guys are waaaaaaaay stronger than they look
Is there a sub for primates acting like humans like this?
The fist bump at the end kills it
He on a mission. Barely has time for a bump. That good fresh fruit must be near. Why is that lion so upset. Oh yeah been in the zoo for a minute.
That brofist at the end is the best thing

If anyone says evolution isnt real show them this video. This monkey is... humane
Man, what a nice monkey. And the fist bump at the end made this so awesome.
Imagine if chimps weren't vicious unpredictable killing machines.
I want some chimpanzee companions. That'd be fucking dope.
What call of duty campaign was this?
I went out clubbing one night, and when I left the club three thugs followed me.  Luckily Monkeybro was waiting for me in a nearby tree.  He swung down and went ape on them.  Needless to say they were no longer interested in mugging me.
He's not a monkey.
How Can you not upvote this?
Not a monkey tho 😏
Forget dogs
Monkeys are mans best friend
Every time I see videos like this it reminds me of their crazy strength
This is real. It is very likely that monkey actually pulled him up. They have incredible strength. I’ve seen videos of monkey holding people
I want this in a video game. Like, Call of Duty: Harambe's Vengeance.
It's not a monkey...its an ape
A chimpanzee is an ape, not a monkey.
Not a monkey. Chimps are Apes
Not a monkey, two ape bros hanging out.
On a slightly related note, do you know how strong these things are? That boi just lifted a grown ass dude up a sheer wall without even flinching. I wonder what it would be like to box a monkey. Im sure one could just shatter my jaw like a saltine cracker with one solid monkey jab. On a high fiber diet the shit it would fling at me would probably tear through me so cleanly that the entire ballistics industry would change forever, and the militaries of the world would adopt backpack monkeys that just have a small sack full of bullets to fling at the enemy.
How do people old enough to post on reddit still not know the difference between an ape and a monkey?
And yet his species home is burning down right now and we don't do anything...
That's so sweet!!
Do you even lift bro?

I let out an audible 'aww' at that fist bump at the end. Dad gave me a quick judgemental glance.
My heart just melted into goop
I wonder if they realize how much weaker and more fragile we are compared to them. I wonder if the chimp could have popped the guys shoulder out if he just yanked him up. Luckily this one seems gentle
posted first on r/ape
im not sure to be scared or to love chimps because they can rip our limbs off but they seem friendly
Ever since that chimp ripped off that lady's face, they've somewhat terrified me.
fuuuck this is awesome
Chimps will literally bite off your balls over a piece of cake. Be careful out there.
wish had a side kick like that :(
I LOVE THIS
Cutest fist bump ever.
r/AnimalsBeingBros
See you on the front page
I bet that monkey could easily pull up a human.  Their muscle density is insane.
Compares to the other apes, we humans are weak af. Chimps, Bonobos, Orangutans, and Gorillas could tear us like tissue.
All fun and games till the incoming fist bump is actually an open hand ripping the skin off of your face because you accidentally made a move that made the chimp feel threatened or angry.
Given how incredibly strong chimpanzees can be, it says something about this one at how gently it grabs its human friend’s hand
Stronk
Someone should make a co op platformer where one player is a monkey.

...the crazy thing is that the chimp probably did pull him up. They’re freakishly strong for their size. Adult males are terrifying.
This kind of interaction raises "brother by another mother" to a whole new level....
sometimes I forget how frickin ripped they are but then I see them lift a whole man
Oh My god, instant love😍😍
Adorable❤️❤️
So this is what Joe Rogan up to.

This was so sweet it made me tear up. What the hell?
Aww. He is so gentle and sweet.
Anybody gonna mention that dinosaur (big kitty) roaring in the background??
I need more of this in my life❤
Well, now I want to fist bump with a chimp.
Knowing chimpanzees, imagine it just ripping his arm off while pulling him up.
Best post I've seen today
So long as people continue to not credit the original accounts, I'll always have a job identifying internet animals. This is kodyantle on Instagram.
Chimps are crazy strong. Like SCARILY strong for their size. Like if an average chimp decided to crack you open and drink your spinal fluid there is nothing you could do to stop them.

But also AWWWW he thinks he's people!
**chimp accidentally rips man’s arm off**

Cute though
Das a strong chimp!
Chimps aren't monkeys! I live near a chimp rescue and they get really irrationally mad about misidentifying chimps as monkeys.
Awesome
Get your hands off me you damned dirty ape...
What a cool, dude. Hope he’s having a good life.
That is so cute
Jamie, pull up that ape pulling that guy up.
Amazing
Chimps have a very complex language that involves a lot of gestures and body language. We are just discovering the surface of it and it makes so much sense why they are amazing at sign language and predisposed to understand complex and abstract meanings.
Let me use my strong hand.
This Is really Cute I don’t think I ever Seen a Monkey so Helpful
Those eyes are so kind!
Ape bro.

The dude has gotta be living an incredible life.
