It has been a long week
When you’re a dog that hasn’t worked a day in his life 
That bed looks so comfortable...
Bed is so good.
I need a dog in my life...

Do all goldens act the exact same?!
I think an angel fell from the sky and into your bed 😭
Golden retrievers: just licking your lips makes you yawn!
This will definitely be an awesome weekend!
I want to crawl into that bed and sleep for 48 hours straight.
I wish that was my weekend
Heaven!  I'm gonna do this with my golden this weekend, too <3
I'm all about the comfy weekend plans, especially as I've become older (recently turned 30). My gf and I hardly see each other during the week because we both work so much. Neither of us works weekends though, so we sleep in hard, brunch + coffee, watch movies/play cards and rarely go out (especially given the cold here in the winter).  I'm more excited to do nothing at the house at 30 than I was to go out to the bars at 20.
That dog's teeth look very clean!
that's a healthy looking dog. Those teeth are perfect.
I strive to feel such comfort every day.
I wonder if Steven enjoyed sleeping in the dog bed last night? 
I just wanna join him. 
Awwwwww...our elderly Staffie has been practicing for the weekend all day today (Friday) under the duvet. Do we mind?! Nope. She’s the world’s loveliest hot water bottle.
I’m kidless for two whole glorious mornings with the hubby. This is me irl this weekend. 

Side note: I hate when our babies are gone, it’s too quiet. 
Wow that doggo is comfy as fuck
 After my husband says goodbye on his way to work ....and I am off.
My Golden everyday. 
That breath must be rank tho
That sheet looks like it could use a wash
Another repost by dickfromaccounting. Great.
I spot a second good boy in the mirror <3
Busy day of doing dog stuff is just going to have to wait.
That’s me right now. Just got off work and I will consider this weekend successful if I never leave my apartment. It’s a get high, sleep and watch Netflix kind of weekend. 
My cats version

Can I borrow him this weekend?
I need a dog.
My spirit animal.
When you wanna get up but your bed is comfy
My dog isn't cool with a blanket covering...
Cozy Boi 
Cute blond in your bed
Same plus Monday is a holiday.

I do have work to do but I'm totally going to do it at home in my underwear.
The dog is radiating comfort
Oh I love this dog so much.  He’s too cute.
26k upvotes for a yawning dog, wtf
how bad does that bed smell?
I can't stop thinking about the fur outline he'll leave behind.
Was it good for you, bby?
/u/kati_28 
Eww there's a huge bedbug on your blanket.
It sounds like ur about to fuck your dog
Have had a 24/7 on call job for 6+ years. Finnaly quit and got a real great gig with weekends off. First guaranteed weekend off and I made my SO promise he would let me sleep in however late my body needed. I'm sure I will be up at 8am but knowing I can sleep and not have anything to do is so relaxing in itsel.
Where exactly did you put the peanut butter... 
r/noisygifs am i the only one?
Weekends are still a thing? Just got home from work at 7am.. jealousy ensues.. :)
Oh the smell of dog in the morning
"Yaaahhhh fukn work man, I do NOT want to deal with my boss today"
That bed has to be full of dog hair. 
That’s more attractive than most of the critters coming out of my covers the morning after the bars...
I want a dog so bad. Pretty much the only reason I'm pursuing further education is so I will be able to make enough to support a dog. 
One of two things my springer loves. Cuddles with daddy and running free along the rivers
That's a HECKIN' G O O D B O Y E you have there fren! 
Get the dogs out of the bed, people! They are dogs! Gross.....
It made me yawn
This is all I want 
Sounds about right!
Same.
How’d you become a dog for the weekend?!
I hate the guilt that comes with it afterwords... yet I continue to do it, interesting what's that called addiction, 
What a life to live...
From a single gif this house looks so cozy for some reason.
r/likeus
Yuppp. 
Dogs have evolved into the most comfortable species on the planet.. 
I want a goldie
Awww 
I have always worked retail. 2018 is the first year I get to celebrate holidays without having to work. God Bless America.
I love golden retrievers!
dog has a better bed than me
Someone needs to do a mashup between this gif and the [groundhog day alarm clock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZbtAFq7dP8). 
Wish I was a golden retriever
single dog single dog single all the way
My lord that’s precious
Ain't that sad?  Most people work so much all they want to do is rest on their time off.  What a life.
Need a cuddle partner? 
Holy christ that looks so god damn cozy.
I hate that I work on the weekends. I want to be this doggo. 
my life in nutshelll
That thumbnail tho.
This boye looks comfy
Maybe I should get up ... nahhh.
Oh man the ultimate cozy weekend ❤️
We call it “Saturday dog” around here
Life goals right there
I need to hug that dog 
I wish! With a book and chocolate in bed all day. Or in front of the TV watching Lost. I'm dreaming!
#LifeGoals
i've never been this comfortable
“Dickfromaccounting”
Your plan is to turn yourself into a DOG?!
Same dog, same.
I recently started at a place that lets me work a little extra each day for 1 flex day a month, which I'm using today to see my cousin in concert.  Yay Sheepdogs.  So awesome. 
Same
I just yawned after watching this
Mm went back asleep haa
wouldnt it be nice to be an animal? no responsibilities
I love that you can see the other good boy in the mirror
I came down with the flu tofay and I cannot hold my dog until I get better. My wife is taking care of her with me in quarantine. My 3 day weekend turned in to flu recovery weekend 
Dog yawns are so amazing
I'm not moving till Monday morning. 
such a cute dog!!! 
boy oh boy life could be rougher!!
The yawn. Ah the yawn... zzz
Soooooo cute!!
Unbelievable 
lol looks just like me

Who is u/dickfromaccounting and why are all of his posts such high quality? 
Quickest way to lose your job
Waking up next to your bitch, niceee
Actually it's a holiday here 😂😂
Where is that human with breakfast in bed? 
Don’t waste your free time 
My name is Kelly and as a professional adult woman I relate to this meme. 
I'm jellyfishin right now.
Every day I see dick from accounting
Screw. You.

I've still got to work for 4 hours today. Least it's only 4 hours
/r/awwakeup 
I wanna snuggle this doggo SO BAD
Pura vida!!!
Get that peanut butter ready 
This is overwhelmingly adorable.  I want to snuggle with puppers.
"Stop covering me with the blanket.. is that a camera?"
Cute

This is an everyday battle. Having to get out of bed and leave my dog who just wants to cuddle is a hard way to start the day but knowing how happy she is when I get home makes it all better. 
r/tuckedinpuppies 
I’m gonna go ahead and call this, DickfromAccounting and Gallowboob are the same guy. Right?
This is all I really want in life.
Dogs are a treasure of humanity 
Damn I wish I had a dog. 
I want this life.
I can hear the high pitch dog yawn
[also a sleepy weekend pup](https://imgur.com/gallery/UHtXr)
aww that's it i'm getting a retriever...and a labrador, and a and a border collie, and a shiba...and a beagle... and a husky
Why confine to just the weekend? Don't forget the weekdays!!
Absolute perfection!
So adorable!
I can hear the squeaky yawn ! 
/r/TuckedInPuppies 
So comfy.
I can relate
Can you guys help me get some karma points?
I would like to point out that bestiality is illegal
Just finished munching that box
Doggo plans is best plan
That's a golden weekend, right there. 
God gave us two hands to pet two dogs at the same time.
Me too thanks
Those are some good plans
/r/cozyplaces
So comfy. Ahh. 
This bed looks comfy
I remember those days, the best days, and then I had a baby.    No sleep, like ever, again for me.  
Give him all the cuddles
I wish i could have a dog. Knowing myself, i would probably hug them to death and traumatize them.
I'm new to Reddit, instantly my favorite post
Petty dog
Aww, this is adorable!
I wish I could haha. With 2 kids under 5, that’s not possible for me anymore
Looking at getting a female golden Retriever to keep me company and be my best friend 22 years old good or bad idea?
Cute
I could FEEEEEL the blankets when he rested his head again. That is some 4D comfort 
Throw in a cat meowing in the dogs face and this is me every weekend morning.
I want to come spend the night with this sweet pooch at your house!
This guy knows how to party
I already feel relaxed watching this gif
This is very soothing to watcg
Perfection!!
That feeling when you wake up & realize you have to take your pet out for a walk but they're watching every little move you make in anticipation of said walk so you must lay still until you are ready.
I see another dog on the end of the bed too (in the reflection)!! What an amazing way to spend the weekend
😘😘

Safe spaces, bark!
That is a great plan! May have to steal your blueprint and do the same myself 🤣 
I miss my fatty Teemo. 
That looks cozy right there.
omg 😍 💜
Step one: Be dog.

Step two: ....

Step three: Profit.
What a time to be alive 
that pup's got some nice lookin' teeth
My life goal is something like this. Hanging out with a yellow lab all day everyday
Excuse me!

Some of us work in hospitality.

Don't be flaunting your happy weekends in front of us!
Lit
Can we please make this the top post on Reddit?
Yup
I need a dog.
thats a good boy
best weekend ever
This pup has the right idea.
I am so jealous 
This dog cannot technically be classified as a canine due to the number of molar teeth it has.  What a really, really weird specimen.  
Yes, please. Can i borrow your puppy? :-)
I miss my puppies so very much
That dog is a champ. 
I've never seen a more comfortable dog!
My naem is dog  
i sleeping in  
we gonna have  
lazy weekend  
i do a yawn  
you do a snore  
go back to bed  
lets snooze some more  

Perfect subreddit. That's literally the sound I made when I saw this goodboyye (+some nonsense syllables)
I'm going on day 5 of working, 7 more to go, then I can finally be just as relaxed as this doggo.
He looks so cozy. 😲 I just wanna squeeze him!
I wish I saw this every morning when I wake up. I miss my Labrador 
man ho man this one hit me right in the feels. I want a dog so bad but I live alone and I work in a career field that involves travel 2/4 days out of the week. Paying for boarding half of the year is unfeasible too
Doggo is a good boi
I recognize that username. Wonder why...
This guy sleeps
new generation dogs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I love golden retrievers
Such a G O O D B O Y E
I wish 
wake up .......
I've watched this like 20 times and it still makes me happy.
There’s something really special to me about a dog cozying up in bed like this. 
It has been a super long week and those are my plans for the weekend. 
Does she/he have a sibling?
Man, I miss having a dog.
Sounds like a good weekend. 
Imagine you go out to a bar one night, get black out drunk, wake up in a strange room, and look over next to you in bed and see what you think is another person under the covers. You panic and begin to think, oh god, what did I get myself into last night. You nervously prepare yourself to lift the covers slowly, to peek at who you went home with last night, when suddenly, you hear the feint whine of a morning yawn, and this good boy pops his head out. The pure ecstasy of relief i would feel is what I’d imagine heroin feels like. 
Op do you have room in bed for another?
I wish my dog would cuddle under the blankets. 
That delicious nap you take after Exam 
Lucky while I need to wake up early for work how I hope hospital is close on the weekends 👍😂
Dogs can make a bed look way more comfortable than they actually are. 
That looks paw-some!
Please life give me this
Hi doggy
Haha looks like me.. 😘 WeekendPlan. 
Here are two of them on that bed 
I’m so jealous of people with dogs who actually want under the covers with them. My dog will immediately leave the room if I even try to cover her up with me. 
He looks so comfy, I want to join him.
I wish I was a dog.
dogs; pure class
Tired doggo.
I fucking wish
I want a dog so bad. Dreaming of a day I can wake up next to my own pup
I would give anything to wake up to this doggo
Ahhhhhh that snuggle face 😆😆😆😆😆 I love it!!! 
My other half 😂😂😂
"Yeah I got up for a bit, then laid back down for awhile"
Honest to god, I think having a friend like that would dial back my suicidal thoughts quite nicely
Lazy dawwwg 
That's what my dog is doing right this moment :)

Edit: Proof! https://i.imgur.com/ICnQ6Twr.jpg
Just noticed the mirror in the background and you have two goldens while I still have zero so I’ll have one of yours now
Sounds about right. 
I want to a) believe in reincarnation and b) believe I’ve been good enough to be a dog in my next life. 
You think this is r/aww until you realize, there is no body, just the head.
