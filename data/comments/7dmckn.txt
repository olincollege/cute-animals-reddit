This reminds me of my dog who knows "gentle" means don't spazz the f out around a baby. Every time she sees a stroller or a carrier she'll go over really slow and just gently lick their head or just sniff/nuzzle them. Then she gets so excited that she was good she turns around and zoomies hard as far away from the baby as she can get. It's adorable. 

edit; In response to people wanting videos, I am really sorry but I don't have one. My dog is now 13 and she doesn't get the zoomies as intensely and I don't know any non walking children that I could use to demonstrate. She was last around a baby last winter and the run around zoomies was more turn around bolt for five steps and then prance around wagging her tail. Still adorable though. 

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/7dmckn/kitty_trying_his_best_to_pet_gently/dpz4rjd/) is a good thread on how to teach your dog to be gentle. 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/hspwZ) is an album of my dog and in shameless self and doggie promotion you can look at my submissions for even more pics of her in r/labrador.

Hope you all have a wonderful day!
Don't use claws, don't use claws, don't use claws
Birds are friends not food... friends not food...
This is going against every natural instinct the cat has.
"Okay, I saw you petting it.  I'll give it a try.  Mmm.  Not as....  [pat-pat]  No, not very exciting.  I'm going to go push a cup off of a table."

That is one patient, trusting bird!
Touch tha birdy
The birds must have done something unthinkable to that cat to have trained him so well. 
Hmmmm.... Not plump enough yet.
Building trust is just part of playing the long game.

The cat isn't trying to pet the bird. They want to dab and bat them around before eating but they know they cant do that so its the equivalent of a little kid, while being watched by a parent, eating a crumb of cake before dinner instead of a whole slice because they know they will get yelled at.
That bird has 0 sense of self-preservation
Reddit Video sucks, right?  Like ... this video just isn't loading for me
Call me ignorant, but I genuinely don't understand peoples priorities sometimes.

There was a post with a guy putting berries over his dogs eyes to look like glasses, and people are pissed off about that, despite the fact that's hardly doing anything to really disturb the dog.

Yet here we have post, which either have a birds life hanging on a thread, or a declawed cat.

Not that I'm saying the poster is bad or anything, it's not like I know the full context of this situation, I just find it confusing.
This bird will eventually get eaten
I used to have a cat and the bird. The bird was the boss of the house, would bite people who tried to eat around her, and would preen the cat. The cat on the other hand was freaked out by the bird and simply tried to get away from her as she chased him, trying to clean his fur.
¬†/u/vredditmirrorbot
"birdy... Good birdy..."
the paw says henlo fren. the tail says kill fren. 
Why do people do this to their pet birds? One bite or claw from a cat can kill the bird due to bacteria poisoning. Unless the cat is declawed and the two were raised together this is a bad idea.

Edit: typo
[Later:](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/f3/8a/6e/f38a6e1df5b8a64f944d840f3e64d522--tv-lineup-classic-cartoons.jpg)
Just checking the temperature. Kitty likes a warm meal.
Shhhhh my precious. Jussttt you wait my precious. We will cooks youse and eatsts you lovely birdeses. Wait till Bright Lord is gone. Yess, bright lord won't protect you. 
I think he's trying to figure out how much murder he can get away with before the humans yell at him.
The only time a cat pets prey gently is when they're hoping they'll make a break for it so they can chase.
See human? We safe together. You can turn your back now. Seriously. Go ahead.
Bird instinctively not moving so cat doesn‚Äôt instinctively pounce and kill the fuck out of it*
That tail twitch gives away his/her emotions.
‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be real.  Is it not afraid?  How?  Why?  What is a cat that cannot scare a bird?  This cannot be real.  Wow.‚Äù
Cat: "we do not have to follow the cycle of the past...we can be friends and end the bloodshed...together."
Bird: "yeah fine long as I stay alive."
SO HARD.... not to KILL... must resist... MUST RESIST!!! 
This makes me nervous 
This birb is cute

I shall not eat

Cuz I such love

His tiny tweet

I reach my paw

We say no wird

I stare in awe

I pet the bird
This is cute. But the owner is an idiot. If that cat even accidentally gets a claw in the bird, it will die. Cats have bacteria in their saliva and on their claws that is poisonous to birds and other animals of prey. Why risk your bird's life for a cute video?
That's not really aww. The cat's natural instincts are to kill the bird and it is fighting against it. Look at it's tail swishing.
Cats carry bacteria in their saliva that, while harmless to most mammals, is extremely infectious and deadly in birds. It's cute, but please don't do this with your own animals! 
That's not petting, that's checking to see if it's ripe :3
I don‚Äôt trust that tail üßê
I can just picture Granny in the background :

"Now now Sylvester, be nice to Tweety while I'm  gone."
MURDER, don't murder, MURDER, don't murder..
My cat would do that but a lot faster with her claws out.
The tail is wagging. The bird's days are numbered.
This is the kind of push notification I'm 100% here for; A+ 
"I'm just gonna touchy the birdy!" <3
Source?  I need to see more. 
Our dog used to do this to hamsters. It's strange and adorable how they learn these things.

One time the hamster got loose(as they do) and hid under a kitchen cabinet. The dog knew where he was and waited for him to come out. When he did our dog caught him and held him there until we put it back in its cage. 
the gentlest of pets
...cats and birds living together..mass hysteria!!!
Cat has more restraint than all of Hollywood and DC combined.  Impressive 
I guess we all play with our food from time to time.
I've always wondered if cats vision is based off motion or in some form works better when objects are in motion versus at a standstill? I've noticed my cats seem to have issues when they drink from a flat still bowl of water, what looks like they have to find the surface before submerging their noses in the water.
Yo guys, you really suck at reading cat bodylanguage. This is "should I eat you or not", not "I want to pet you".
That's a really good kitty.
Mine would look at it and lose her mind, chattering her teeths like a maniac.
I've seen my cat do this with the mice he catches. He's trying to get it to fly away so he can chase it.
Human, am I doing this right? Ok, I'll try again.
Toucha da birb 
Looks like the kitty is trying to provoke it. My cats do this when playing/practicing their instinctive hunting  [cat-ninja] skills.
Touch da birdy
Bird: oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck üò∞
I'm afraid for this bird

Look at that tail go. This cat is fighting its instincts with everything it's got.
That tail is wagging like mad, the cat is fighting every instinct in its body to not monch that bird...
That kitty is left pawed. 
It's just a slow-motion attack.
...And my 1-year-old human pokes me in the eyes and sticks her fingers in my ear while I try to nap.
Sylvester is flipping in his grave.
Gracious that‚Äôs sweet.
I will not murder you. I will not murder you. I will not... murder you.
I can't believe animals are real, sometimes.
I have passed the test. I will diminish, and go into the West...
If someone can teach a cat to be nice to a bird how come humans can‚Äôt be nicer to each other??
If this was my cat that bird would have been slapped into next week üòÇ
My cat does the same with the wild birds in our garden. They‚Äôve learned not to fear him. They let him approach them. It‚Äôs adorable. There are some trees up against a 5ft fence in my court yard and there are some birds that build a nest on a branch right above the fence every year. The cat walks along the fence and watches the baby birds in the nest like he‚Äôs guarding them. Even nuzzles them occasionally. The parents don‚Äôt seem at all concerned and no other cats bother them coz my cat won‚Äôt let them in his yard.
I think the usual 'cute' animal posts whoring for karma are played out and stale.. but this really raises the bar for cute, amazing OC, gud jeb op.
^^^^^touchy
Soft kitty, warm kitty...
He's actually checking if the bird is ripe enough. 
That is one of the most amazing, heart-breakingly wonderful things I have seen in all of my 69 years.
i pets the birb
Me trying to make friends with an introvert 
I hate to say it, but this is not ok. The cat should be taught to avoid the bird, because even a small accidental scratch can kill the bird. I was looking into having a bird with a cat, and everything I could find said "don't". Site after site filled with anecdotes about how the cat got along with the bird for a decade and then tried to play once and *boom*, dead bird.

Edit: Feel free to downvote, but if you're thinking about having both animals, please do your research. I wanted both so bad, but I couldn't in good conscience do it.
"I'm not clawing you! I'm not clawing you!"
These posts always worry me because I imagine some foolish pet owner seeing these and trying to introduce their pet to a small animal, only to have their pet immediately murder it.
I love my cat, but he only has four interests:

sleep/
murder/
practicing how to murder/
eating

He's pretty savage. The other day I found two Cardinal heads in the yard, meaning he caught one, and when it's mate came to the rescue, he murdered it, too. Then he ate their bodies.
What a good putty tat! 
What a nice guy : )
how is the bird fine with that?

Kitty is waiting for you to turn you back and get a mouthful of feathers.
That bird is very trusting.
stupid cat you are supposed to eat the bird duh
I might watch this for an hour or two
"Oh shit, he's not scared. That must be one badass bird"
He‚Äôs letting the bird to get fat for Christmas... not yet Tomas, not yet...
I needed this today. Thank you 
Sure, focus on the cat.  That bird has balls of steel.
Bird: I twaut I got pet'd by a puddy cat... I DID... I DID!!!! *adjusts self to the right*
How do you train a cat to treat a bird this way?  Assuming you aren't willing to go through multiple birds in the process.  
Awws most gentle cat i‚Äôve seen
Well he did a damn good job
jack W
This person is crazy. Instinct kicks in for One moment and the bird is all feathers.
was waiting for the cat to eat the bird, left dissapointed 
The tail never lies, it's saying I want to eat you.
Cats just checking if the rope he tied to the birds wing is secure.
That is so awesome and also very funny
That cat has the cutest dumb look I've ever seen
This is like the first cat video I've laughed out loud at in a long time. 
Accomplishment.
He/she deserves all the treats
I belibe I've seen a cute kitten 
Beep boop boop  boop beep

Boop boop boop beeeeeeeep beep beep
You know you have been watching WAY TOO MUCH law and order when you glance and scroll past this thinking it said guilty instead of gently.... I need a long break from that show...
The bird's like... "Hole Fuck!  I don't care how much they're paying me, I just hope he doesn't rip my fucking gizzard out!  Where's my goddamn stunt chickadee?!?"
This is the cutest thing I've seen today 
That's a good kitty right there
It‚Äôs a funny clip and all but also an interesting one. This cat that would usually hunt birds is thinking multiple things here. It‚Äôs thinking ‚ÄòI should kill and eat this thing‚Äô and at the same time thinking ‚Äòmy human likes this thing so I shouldnt‚Äô. A curious case of an animal with ire-movable instincts conflicting with domestication.   
That bird is so confused..
The kitty says. "Hmmm. Not so sure if this one is tender enough" 
Cat: "OK bird listen... We're in this together so that this lanky hooman will enjoy the cuteness and give us food; but know this... If this hooman don't feed me enough. Ya dead!" 
Hmm if I just do it gently.. shall I? No I shouldn't. Ok fine I will but just gently, a few little taps. Small strokes. Oh ok maybe stop that. But actually that was nice. Maybe just a bit more gentle this time. If I tilt my head it seems more gentle. Aw little strokes. Oh, wow ok he doesn't like the strokes. What's the point. Why do I bother. 
My 3 year old says... "he's trying to be as person."
This bird is dumb too. It will not survive in the wild 
Finches are friends, NOT FOOD...
That cat is about to pounce on that bird. Look at the tail. The tail never lies
Lol any cat owner will tell you that is not what is happening. Cat is being tempted into attacking but the bird just is chill and the cat is well fed so the prey drive isn't fully kicking in. 
Bird trying his best not to shit himself. 
OMG it's the Apacolypse as predicted by Peter Venkman...
Fuck it. CHOMP
You know when human turns their head that birdy is **dead**.

Pet gently? He's tenderizing the meat!
I'm not sure which I'm more surprised by, the fact that the cat didn't go full murder hobo on the bird, or that the bird didn't instantly try to fly away when then cat got near it.
Mmmm... you'll make a good lunch 
Just give her a tap. A little tap-tap-taperoo 
I like how happy the cat is with itself after it completes the pet 
That cat was a fine art student in his past life
It rubs the lotion on its feathers or else it gets the hose again...
Looks like a very smart cat.
"Must. Not. Eat. Birdie."
This just reminds me that my cat is an asshole.
'I'm not touching you, I'm not touching you.. whoops! "

I would not leave that bird alone with that cat for one fucking second!
OH MY F'ING GAWD!!!! That was the most adorable thing I've seen all day! Good night internet!
The cat is struggling against its own primal instinct. The tail tells all...

Maybe the cats in my life are just assholes.
I‚Äôm surprised the bird still alive?
Really cute stuff, very interesting and a bear is doing that to you.
I've noticed my cats seem to have a very short attention span?
That is so freaking adorable! 
Reminds me of Silvester and Tweety. üòä
House cat...never been up close to a bird before. My old cat poked stuff the same way if it was new and never seen before. 
Meanwhile, in another cute video, a baby seal receives a gentle kiss from a pet shark
Birds are friends, not food
That's because she knows her owner loves it and feeds it,if it was outside she would of ripped her eyes out through it's beak 
That is one brave bird. (and one well-behaved cat. "my human likes this thing. trying . . . my . . .best . . . not . . . to . . .kill . . .it")
Lol trying his best indeed. The instinct to destroy is evident... Look at that tail go! 
Why doesn't anyone say he is a good boy. Do cats get left out of being good?  What a good Boy!
He wants his dinner to be purfect
This is awful. Even a tiny scratch could kill that bird. Its irresponsible to put the bird in this situation. 
[deleted]
As someone who keeps cats and birds as cute as this is this is really dangerous and stressful for the bird sadly. Predators and prey shouldn't really be put together for the sake of cuteness or up votes

I know there are ppl who truly believe their pets won't harm each other and that may even be the case. When I was a kid we had a cat who would let our guinea pigs crawl all over him. but the risk is always there and it just isn't worth it :(
..... "nailed it...."
it's hard to hold back the claws of death
I'm not sure which animal is more surprising.
How is the cat not killing it? How is the bird not freaking out? How is this happening?
"What is this from cookie jar?! Is it crunchy on the outside? Does it have creme filling? Mommy says no nom-nom snacks before dinner but if it will hop in my mouth... not my fault!"
I wonder how many people who upvoted this think the cat is actually petting the bird, instead of trying to play with (and kill) it.
Can we not have animal cruelty/neglect on this sub? Prey and predator pets should never be together. It's incredibly dangerous for both animals, not to mention stressful.
That's some of the cutest stuff I've ever seen. 
Really cute stuff, very interesting and a wonder of nature when you think of it.
This cat is so precious. 
hoping kitty knows that if he attacks the bird, he is in deep shit

wondering how one would teach kitty this
This is so precious 
I physically "awwww"d to this, that's adorable ;w;
So cute!
Was half expecting the cat to eat the bird at the end. Then I looked at what sub this was in.

That looks like it might be grandma's cat.
Look at that tail.  It takes a lot of frustrating self-control to touch things gently!
What a gewd boi
Feathery folks are friends, not food.
Does anyone know why it seems like cats have a very short attention span? After h pets him the first time, he stop and turns his head, and stares off into space for a second, then tries to pet him again. IT looks like he's either losing focus (and then it registers there's a bird there again) or they are processing information from the first interaction. Any ideas? Have tons of cats around here and they all do the same with things. 
Came from popular and didn't know it was from r/aww. Fully expected to see the bird get swatted away the second time
What a nice stripey tuxedo kitty 
Lightly tenderizing before meal time

Poor bird, "is, is this normal?"
Any know why cats touch things like this? 
My cat was doing this yesterday with a chapstick.  She'd barely touch it
"Do you have any idea how badly I wanna kill you?" - Cat, probably 
Kitty's tail is wagging, he's trying really hard not to eat the bird in front of his human.
He is fighting back the urge to bat him.

Geez, even the cats are out here groping folks.

It is going against every fiber in this cat..... meow...
Dude.... do you see a bird? I see a bird... tap tap... holy crap, it‚Äôs real, I totally touched it. Nah, it can‚Äôt be real, you‚Äôre messing with me. It‚Äôs just the ‚Äònip... Wait, let me check again...

Concentrating so hard on petting gently, his eyes are crossing!
I like the bird's nervous look to the camera holder

"I dunno 'bout this..." 
This is probably a cat who has been told not to touch the bird or no kitty when he goes near it! He‚Äôs just like ok no touch but gentle boop 

Then again I had a cat who was ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with the hamster we had, would let the hamster make a lil nest in his tail and all sorts of weird shit 
He's just grooming his dinner
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok if I boop, right?

Can I please... can I...‚Äù

*Boop*

‚ÄúYeah, Nailed it.‚Äù

He's just killing him softly. 
I'll never forget the time my sister's cat killed her mouse before she got out of school one day. My mom drew a white chalk outline for the mouse and everything.
This made me feel all warm inside.

'It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again' 
Aww that‚Äôs such a well-tempered cat. The slow blink between the pet attempts was so adorable.
Awh, this is the way my old lady cat (Iynx, hence the username) touches my face when she wants my attention.  Very very gentle, soft as she can, just a little ‚Äúboop boop‚Äù and a meow. <3
Nothing see about this. That evil fucking bird is plotting.
"I could kill you, you know. If I were to do it, i'd do it right ... here. I'd take a look at your lifeless body and I'd swing once more in delight, just to spite you."

"Enjoy these boops while they last, the human will have to leave eventually."
Such a nice kitty <3
In all seriousness, does anyone know why a cat in this situation would desist from killing a bird?
This has actually made my day.
You iz fluffy ,I want to touch
My favorite sub HANDS DOWN. 
Adorable.
He's like "can this bird see my paw coming at me while my human is filming this? cuz i'll be back later to eat you" 
Kitty looks loaded!
This is awesome. 
Yeah... I don't think that's what's going on here. That cat definitely has the 'ooo.. tasty' look in his eye. 
I fucking love cats 
Let's be real here the kitty is just proving if the bird is real or not so it can eat it rawr
1. What a sweet kitty!

2. üòÆ What a terrified, trusting, patient bird. Imagine that you're standing there and a bear is doing that to you. Same exact thing

Cartoons have taught me this doesn't end well for the cat 
This is how my kitty pets me in the morning (same time every day) to wake me up so I feed him. He's the cutest. 
Approaching a latina like 

If at the end he decided to make his move and snatch the bird and eat him you'd have enough Reddit gold to last a lifetime 
Looks like the bird is on glue
Now our pets will pet other pets. They are evolving!
Helo fren!
No kill? Just touch.  No kill... want to kill... but just touch... No kill?  No kill... just touch... but no kill... soft paw, soft paw, no kill... bored.
That's probably the sweetest thing I've ever seen. 
So how exactly do you get your cat to not hunt/kill that bird?
OP, are these your critters?  Is the bird still alive?
Anyone else just waiting for a moment at the end where the cat gets tired of playing nice and just whacks the bird off it's perch? 
Was anyone else waiting and hoping that the cat would end up just smacking the shit out of the bird?
Amazing to see this,  wow
That is so cute that the cat is being so gentle.
Really, I'm not falling for the fake bird trick again!  It aint real!  They wouldn't have just left it out there for me to take.
Interesting how he didn't use the closer paw. Can cats be left or right handed too?
Yeah "play". If that bird starts moving it'll be dead in a minute.
"I wish this dumb hooman would leave so I can finally tear apart this flying meatball without being punished for it..." *wags tail frustradedly*
This is not natural.
Later that stupid bird became Kitty one month food supply.
How is this possible? Cats usually want to devour birds, no?

What happened to the cat instinct to kill that small animal?

Birds are friends not food
How did the owner even get to the point of this being a thing? Like is the cat trained? How does the owner trust it so much? How would you even train a cat not to attack a bird? Was the cat just around wildlife and they found it was docile? 

I just would be terrified of the cat attacking the bird I wouldn't even let it close.

It's the dinosaur scene from Tree of Life--the birth of choice!
Touching like it could split when pawned
Kitties instinct is to brutally kill, but it's spoiled life has dulled it's instincts to a gentle tap
I see "Kitty trying to resist urge to kill"
Was I the only that wanted him to smack it accidentally at the end?
Poor guy...fighting thousands of years of behavioral traits....
Very much expected this to end in horror, even after checking the sub... 
He's so gentle!

But just in case, stick around, human.
Be still, my heart! 
I half expected this to end with an Ozzy Osbourne-style head chomp. Good kitty.
‚ÄúCan I eat it?‚Äù No .‚Äùk just touchy‚Äù
+/u/sodogetip 2 doge verify

The bird's like; "Is it gone yet?"
‚ÄúIs this thing real?‚Äù
GOOD BOY +1
Was this cat born with any instincts?
This one way to reach mass bird extinction. 
Boink, boink, boink. How to be human. 
I'd say he did pretty well.
That bird is incredibly nonchalant about that cat
Bird is probably terrified. 
Super cute

Pretty sure that cat is a robot. 
And she wiiiiill be eaten.
Next scene, trying to gently lick the little birdy
I love how intensely he's focusing, and then once he stops petting he's like "man, I'll get it right next time"

"maybe just one more try...."

"nope nevermind, I'll save this task for another day" 
Such a good kitty.
Such concentration to be gentle ha ha
can't access on reddit app
Is that cat cross-eyed by any chance? 
The birds looking at the cameraman like: ‚Äúare you really just gonna stand there and let this shit happen.... seriously??‚Äù
More like "is this thing alive and worth eating?"
Why aren't there feathers everywhere? I thought this was an insta-kill moment?
r/CatTaps
Or just wondering how tasty it would be. 
Watching Tweety Bird and Sylvester as a kid had me thinking of another outcome at the end.
Building up trust to be left alone together
Sweet baby angellllll
...?....
That face tho, you know when you aren‚Äôt looking.....
Link please
That tail wagging around - kitty is so focused.
That is amazing, was so expecting the punchline to be a cloud of feathers.
must...resist....pushing...off...edge...
Ah one, ah two, ah three... CRUNCH

This was the tensest, most stressful thing I've watched all week.
Awkward. 
This bird is shitting bricks.
Good kitty!
Superb 
And then it was ripped apart like the prey it is
Who's a good kitty!?
I imagine it having the inner monologue voiced by Timmy from South Park. 
"I love you, Food."

Relieved that this wasnt a r/CatsISUOTTATFO post
Aahahah when h
Birds are friends, not food!
What a pretty cat face!! Sweet! üò∏üò∏
Bzoop 
üëâüòéüëâ
Birb is frien, not food.
Why does the cat tilt its head? For balance? 
NIce video. Cat caring bird. Thanks for the video.
My cat does this with flies or moths he finds, he‚Äôs nice he doesn‚Äôt kill the bugs just pets then and chases them... he genuinely feels bad if we kill the bug or he kills it by accident 
Wish my kitty was that gentle smh 
He is such a good, gentle boy!!!
My boy cat, Toast, does this to my beard every day to wake me up.  He's such a sweet dummy.  
Birds are friends, *not* food.
You can actually see the effort in his face on how hard he is resisting the impulse to attack.
I would like to have this gentle cat. He is a sweetheart.
Testing the bird's reflexes is all.
All I can hear are really high pitched boops 
I think your cat is broken.
..touch...touch..touch
See, I can play nice.
Cat looks cross eyed
I catch myself in the bird tapping position when I'm super focused on something.  Head in ridiculous angle and bent to the side.  Don't do puzzles with me. 
*tasting the meat*
is it me or does it look like the cat looks like he's painting 
Kitty asking 'are you real?' :))

I can hear Mcnulty's voice coming out of that bird. 

*What the fuck did I do?*
That is one brave bird
"In a different world, i would eat you" 
did he eat it?
Booptiy boop boop    
BOOP BOOP!

It is the abundance of fast twitch muscle fibers and lack of fine motor skills that make most animals kind of all or nothing. You can see that when cants for example try to be gentle they are kind of shaky and disoriented, yet they can spring up 5 feet and pick a bird out of the air, or rip your face off. 

Look at the difference between a chimp and a human. Chimps are far stronger, but lack much of our dexterity and slow twitch muscle fiber. All about nerves and muscles. 
There's no glass in front of this?
Send it back, get a refund 
This is what my cat did, when I showed him the mouse behind the stove that I wanted him to murder - acted like he was afraid it was going to explode. üôÑ
"I toucha the birdie."
as frequently as birds poop, i‚Äôm quite surprised it didn‚Äôt during this scary moment 
Such a sweet cat and birb :D 
I'm waiting for the bird to go crazy and peck the cat, but nah
:0
Meaow, tender tender
I feel like the cat‚Äôs just practicing its future attack.

‚ÄúJust you wait til these cameras are gone...‚Äù 
Is it just me or does the cat look like a puppet for much of this video?
"Musn't...eat...the birdy"
Is this cat declawed?
"Birds are friends."

"Birds are friends."

*(suppress instinct to destroy)*

"Birds are friends." 
Save this food for later...
"..tell me about the rabbits"
This is your bird now
The lion shall lie down with the lamb. That's some biblical shit right there.

Bird: r/youseeingthisshit ???


How can I direct link this video? Pluzzzz
That‚Äôs hilarious. I am glad that was the outcome 
this bird has a distorted fear mechanism
It‚Äôs like a fat guy trying to avoid eating a French fry. 
How the heck do I just get the video link with no comment thread?
Wow. That's one trusting birb. 
Good idea placing the bird above the jar! That‚Äôs how I collect all my bird do-dos. 
Nice birdy cute birdy imma eat you birdy
Am I high or does that cat look like max and ruby 
*Boop, Boop boop*
Soo damn cute but the cat looks like he might be stirring up an appetite 
I‚Äôm surprised the bird acted so cool and detached. No survival instinct kicking in whatsoever 
this remind me of edward scissorhands, beautiful
I've seen ton of cat videos. So many I jist kind of tune out when watching them. But this. This is so cute, the cat actually being gentle. I love this video. 
Touch the birdie?
...
Touch the birdie.
...
Touchy touchy!
I am very impressed by the patience and self control of both animals. 

The tolerance of that birdie, lawd...
I like when cats have Mickey mouse gloves paws 
Me trying to talk to a millennial without offending them.
This looks scripted. 
Pet pets pet's pet
take my updoot! I love this so much :D
I wish I could get my cat to do this with the bird, but she is both terrified of him and wants to eat him
Ima toucha tha birdy.
Bird are friends, not food <such gentle pets>
If Tom saw this he‚Äôd be upset
I seriously almost anticipated that the cat would eat the bird in the end.
My cat does this to my face sometimes. He rolls on his side when he wants my attention and gently pats at my face lol. 
Is..is this real?? Kittys high as fuuck. 
Me_irl with animals
Touchy the chirpy. 
That my friend is a tricky tricky cat.  "Just wait till the human leaves...."
This is some of the most precious shit ive ever seen!
Oh God I love those slow blinks they do 
Love it
Cats can be considerate and thoughtful.  I don't care what the haters say.
This video made me like cats
What do cats think petting is?
Just trying to touch it or actual affection?
That's one hell of a good kitty
This would also work well in /r/PetsPettingPets  :3
"I do to u what human does to me. Wait, this is hard...."
Kitty looks very confused. "I feel like there is something more murderous I should be doing, but petting is okay I guess."
Thats a sweet cat ya got there
A cat as cute as this wouldn't hurt a fly but befriends them.
My heart just melted.
Consider the internet won for today. üíñ
i always love the little head turns. 
Turn your back for five seconds and kitty will have feathers dripping from his mouth. 
This is absolutely adorable
"Birds are friends, not food."
Seriously though, I could watch this all day. Must. Stop. Watching. 
I'm more amazed at how unfazed the bird is.
He‚Äôs resisting the urge to eat it.
So... There is hope for cats, after all.

Sizing up birdie for cooking times....
every fibre of the cats being is screaming,

eats da ficking birb,

For some reason, the cat looks like a young Harrison Ford, especially in Blade Runner.... it's those eyes.
That is a cool ass looking cat.
‚ÄúYou see? I am gentle cat meow, you can go to store and I watch birdie‚Äù 
‚ÄúThere there there....‚Äù
Why is it everytime i open a link from vreddit it is slow af
*What dis*

*It move?*

*Hey you thing, you move?*
If a cat can be taught not to kill a bird, anything can be taught anything
I was waiting for the cat to pimp slap the bird across the room, then I noticed this is r/aww
"Can I touch da birdie?"
The sheer willpower displayed is amazing 

Cat must be named Bruce üòú
Oh...nice things...are nice.
Me talking and being near women now and days.
Pretty bird.  Pretty bird.
