It‚Äôs also amazing because he looks fantastic at 17!

So that's what happened to Ser Pounce.
The chair looks more well-constructed than season's 8 storyline.
That's badass! I want one üòè

Also, post this in r/gameofthrones
i am the cat, on royal throne

Approach! n bend the knee!

This is amazing
Extremely well done. He knows he is majestic
All hail King Arthur

Desired ending.
Preferable to the ending D&D have planned
Behold Catleesi, Meowsa, Mother of Meowreen, the Unbrushed, Chaser of Chains, Queen of biting Sandals.
I lost my cat that I had from 6 months old to just after her 17th birthday. Cherish every day with him! You never know when this is the last year.....

If he wants treats, you give him treats. Pets - give him pets! Wants on your lap (or head) do it. I would do anything to have one more day with my little baby girl.
Awesome throne! Now which one of the swords is his Excalibur?
Dope af. I‚Äôd bend the knee.

Could you share any wisdom on what you do to keep your lovely cat friend healthy and happy looking for 17+ years? I have a kitty who is turning 10 and I want him around as long as possible. i know keeping him from being fat and giving him lots of access to fresh water is important, but what else do you do for your cat? food suggestions? etc. 

I don't even watch GoT and I think this is cool as heck.
[deleted]
Looks like a lannister (lion) won the game of thrones...
I‚Äôve never watched Game of Thrones, but I‚Äôd totally watch it if the main characters were cats.
I am so happy he decides to sit on it for you
The rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and any countertops in this house.
The king Westeros deserves
That is amazing and his Highness deserves it!
He looks good for a 17 year old King
Long may he reign
r/bossfights
I give that throne a week before it is scratched up.
At the rate the series is going, this is the best possible outcome for the show.
I have a 19 year old that looks exactly like that cat. what a beauty. üôÉü•∞
My Princess Ophelia (Pan's Labyrinth reference) better not get any ideas from this.
Aww! I have a 17 year old kitty too and I wish I could give him something like this!
All hail His Grace, Arthur of Houses u/PM_ME_UR_FAVCOLOR and u/webdevguyneedshelp, First of His Name, King of the Home and Yard, Lord of the Kitties, and Protector of the Humans.
He looks great! I have a 17 year old girl cat myself, she looks just as good! Nice to see the old timers doing well!
*when you realize that cardboard and a cat are better than GoT season 8
Hopefully this will stop people from complaining about the show for 5 minutes. Seriously the complaining has become so toxic it's ridiculous.
This would be a better ending then what we will probably get
I'd take this over next week's ending...
Honestly give me this instead of whatever shitty ending they have planned.
Long live the King!!! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
That‚Äôs spectacular. Look at him! He loves it ‚ù§Ô∏è

SHED!
Hear me rawr.
Cool! What kind of paint did you use? I feel like spray paint would be too stinky.
Dude what's with all the episode leaks?
Cats already look down on people, and you made yours a throne. Nice
This is just outstanding content all around
Looks like he loves it
Oh, wow! This is amazing!
So much fluff
That's so badass!
That‚Äôs cardboard? Where do I buy cardboard like that?
Fancy cat.  Mine just sits in a cardboard box left over from Christmas.
Valar Meowgulis
*naps on a piece of paper half the size of his body*
17! He looks great! I just had to put my cat down a week ago, and she was only 15. 

In any case, he looks happy with his new sleeping spot. Make sure he gets lots of love, and be on the lookout for anything suspicious. Animals don't give you much of a hint that anything's wrong, and by the time you notice odd behavior, it's often too late.
Oo! Oo! Make an Iron cardboard throne next!
Well, sorry but this is my new wallpaper! ‚ù§Ô∏è
And his voice could be heard from the furthest reaches of Sovengarde.
He is known in the dragon tongue as 
**DOVAHKITTY!**
Sweet kitty!  Reminds me of the cat I had growing up.

This is awesome!!!
Game Of Mews
The GoT ending we need.
My cat is also 17 years old this year!
When you live long enough to see someone put more effort into a cat chair than the actual show it‚Äôs based on
Felion Lannister!
that cat's expression is entirely "where is your throne, peasant? I thought not".
Legit one of the greatest things I‚Äôve seen in a very long time. Hats off to you.
 He is going to rip it to shreds the same day
I had a cat named Arthur. He was a huge, sleek, black cat who loves to sit in the middle of our (round) dining room table.
What a charming king! BEND THE KNEE!
Your cat's at the top of Reddit right now.  Sitting on two thrones
That is a damn good looking cat, regardless of its age.
He looks so majestic
And he earned that throne. Pretty boy looking so majestic.
That is the most stoic looking cat I have ever seen, and the fact he us named king Arthur makes it even better
Now this is the kind of content I want.
that's a rich cat.
What a beautiful noble looking cat!    He deserves his beautiful throne.   May he rule for many more years to come.
Okay, he‚Äôs 17 but like he‚Äôs 2 years old in his second life, because my goodness he looks so young!!!! Give the king some good pets from his loyal subject (me haha)
Ya shoulda put a cup of Starbucks beside it lol
Imagine you go through all that work and the cat won‚Äôt even touch the thing
Now amazed the cat sat in the expected spot
A Song of Mice and Friskies.
Outstanding. Thanks for sharing. Might do something like this myself.

Glad you take care of animals. Not enough of us on the planet.
Queen Purrcei
"See, this should be a show. This is the show."
I told everyone Ser Pounce wins and nobody believed me
My cat, King Henry, needs a throne lol
It‚Äôs amazing to see an older cat in such great shape, my cat who is one of the greatest things in my life is approaching 14, and this gives me hope she has many more years.
SpOiLeR ALeRt: GoLdEn LiOn DOMINATES iRoN tHRonE!
Aslan was not top of my list for the iron throne.
Next, you must make him a cardboard Holy Grail!
Our starship is in trouble!
A coat of gold, a coat of red

A lion still has claws
I freaking knew it!

Ser Pounce wins the Iron Throne!!!

His Grace!

Probably the best ending they could hope for.
Wow I love this

Are you willing to share your construction method?
Arthur, First of his Name, Rightful King of the Angoras, Russian Blues and the First Cats, Cougher of Hairballs, Shredder of Carpets and Ruler of the Seven Catdoms of Hissteros
Does he actually like the throne or is it a chore to get him in it?
/r/seniorkitties
Both cat and throne are amazing!!
This is by far the most awesome pic I have seen today on Reddit.
That is so cool !!!
I love him
The beauties of cardboard
KING BABIES!
Why does your cat remind me of Tywin Lannister but a cat
That's some amazing craftsmanship! And King Arthur looks very much at home on his throne.
King Percei
King of the First Felines.
The true kitteh heir to the iron throne! majestic AF
Majestic floof.
The impressive part is you got the cat to sit on it.
Amazing. üò≠
Long may he reign.
Ser Pounce, House of The Claw
Ser Pounce?
Gods, I was fluffy then.
https://imgur.com/a/KYtOzmo

Cat twins! Spicers was 18, she passed earlier this year.  Fluffy kitties are the best.
Hold on... is that cat 17 years old and named King Arthur, or did you make the throne out of like a King Arthur cardboard costume? Genuinely confused here lol

Still have an upvote :)
The true heir(ball) to the throne
That's one majestic looking cat.
So then that's.... a cardboard throne.
Perfect name for that cat. He looks magnificent.
Shellac the shit out of It so your awesome piece of hard work doesnt become a scratch pad, lol
Damn that‚Äôs awesome!
He looks like he commissioned his subjects to build that throne. Very regal. I love it!
One throne to rule them all
The only way to save season 8.
Your Highness is devilishly handsome...
You‚Äôve doomed us all
Once he knows its cardboard it will become the Iron scratching post rather than the Iron Throne.
This better be replacing his old throne, because there's *no* reason that regal feline hasn't had a throne before now.
Jon Smeow the true king!
**BRILLIANT!**
Valar Meowghullis
Does the kitty have 3 heads?
I‚Äôm impressed both by the craftsmanship and the  fact the cat is using it. At least for a minute!
Probably doesn't even notice it's in the shape of an Iron Throne...and is just like ooh cardboard surface to lie on.
Perfection
Meowgar the Cruel
Your cat is beautifulüòç
Your offering has pleased his royal tastes. He will allow you to live another day, only to offer him even more wonderous delights.
Gonna be a shame when he tears it to shreds in about 5 mins.
The REAL lion of Lannister
Bro wtf GoT spoilers!!
I dub thee Sir Pounce.
a miracle that he sat it in
SPOILERS!
"Yes, very good human. I shall let you live another year."
Ser Pounce subverting expectations on who will end up on the iron throne
so now we know what King Arthur reincarnated to
As you should human, as you should.
You must bend the knee immediately
Cardboard iron
nice detail!!
Looks like sibling of my kitty
King Pounce, First of His Name, The Untrained, Hunter of Stink Bugs, Bane of Furniture, Inhabitant of Boxes, Hocker of Vomit and the Furred Balls, and Protector of the Realm
Sir Pounce is a badass.
Wow I'm more impressed that he didn't choose to lie down on a random place on the floor instead of a throne you made
u/title2imagebot
He's so regal, Sir Meowington Lannister
Lol I need this for my cat, for he is the true ruler of the house, But other than that i'm in charge, no body else except my wife. But, after them I am the true king.
Tormund turned into a kitty
-Thing made out of box material. ‚úì

Wow. Looks great.
Ser Pounce, the true heir to Westeros
He looks majestic!
I could  spend years building the perfect shrine for my cat and she would end up sitting on a piece of scrap cardboard and never touch what I make.
That is one regal man.
I have nothing clever to say other than this is amazing!
Nice job! Lucky cat.
Dam, My kats look like gutter trash compared to that majestic beast!
"Our starship is in trouble"
A true ruler indeed. *bows*
Majestic and beautiful boy.
Not sure if really big cat or really smol chair
Ser Pounce !
Damm give him the plastic coffe cup
My cat needs one of those!
A cat ruling Westeros is probably a better idea for the ending than whatever D&D shit out onto their desks.
Tbh at this point I wouldn't be mad if this is how season 8 ends up ending
He looks so regal! ‚ù§Ô∏è And he doesn't look a day past 7 üòÉ
Very nice
üôå
WOW! Spoiler Alert!! Gawd
I love how he is so stoic on his iron throne.
Well done you
Love this so much.
The night is dark and full of purrers.
I'm American and have never actually said these words before, but the first thing I thought when I saw this was " He looks right chuffed."
He looks awesome üòç
He belongs there.
Hah, he has no idea what game of thrones is
Meaawwjestic as f*ck
I'd be more scared of a flying cat than a dragon.
That is one Regal looking cat. Arthur was a purrfect name for him
A mouse! My kingdom for a mouse!
cats and cardboard, such a great pairing
Most amazing part is he's actually using it
That cat is as old as me
I put a cardboard box on my head today.

This is pretty cool too

Edit: CARDBOARD, REALLY!? THIS IS EPIC!
Pet love level = 1000%
"It's about time someone recognized my importance around here."
This is as majestic as it gets.
Purrrrr-cie Lannister
I want to see what it looks like after he chews it to pieces.
I'm just shocked he used something you intended him to use...   If I were to put that much effort into a chair for my cats, they'd for sure sit on a crumpled up towel instead.
Better ending than we're getting.
yes
A chair fit for a king
Spoilers! At cat ends up on the throne. No need to watch the rest.
All hail King Arthur
Ser Pounce!
But this this does put a smile on my face
He looks like he was made to be there in that chair... throne
Bro are all of y'all gonna make game of thrones jokes with a cat fair enough do you
That's one majestic looking feline!
What a badass
What if he starts scratching it?

Cats do like scratching cardboard
r/CTLLRP
God he‚Äôs so handsome.
He looks wise.
Long may he reign
I'd prefer this over the leaked ending.
Handsomest King kitty
as you do
Long live the King.
*bends the knee*
Cersei Lannipurr
Kitty king! I want one for me cat!
The ending we've deserved all along.
He‚Äôs looking so ROYAL and comfortable in his amazing throne, long may he rule over you.ü§ó
Well deserved
Kitty purrgaryan, ruler of the seven meowdoms
The likelihood of a cat using a thing is inversely proportional to the effort or expense that went into acquiring that thing.  So I'm amazed that this gorgeous boi is actually sitting on this awesome throne like an actual king!
The crossover to end all crossovers
The biggest shock here is that he is actually using it.
‚ÄúGo change my litter box, you pleasant‚Äù
how cute
nice lol
If it wasn't made of cardboard he probably wouldn't have anything to do with it.
A Kat in the North!
A lion rules the land.
Cat Rules.jpg üòé
What kind of cat is he?
Better outcome than S8
Soooo.. Is it cardboard or iron?
and the real test was getting him to sit on it.
The true king of the north. (Also my heart).
Wow... he‚Äôs bigger than the throne üòÜ
17? He looks very youthful in his old age.
What is it made of?  
Very nice job!!
The King looks very majestic and deserves his throne.
Impressive.
finally, a worthy leader!
Careful, Reddit decided it didn‚Äôt like GoT two weeks ago.
Bend the paw, or die
King we deserve
a king if I ever saw one
The true winner of the iron throne
I am so impressed! I am even more impressed that he likes it and sits on it!
Fuckin lannisters
Beautiful cat
SPOILER: he destroyed it in 2 seconds
If you haven‚Äôt already, this needs a how-to video on YouTube.
Nice
Wow. He‚Äôs majestic af
You made your cat a throne....AND HE USED IT?? You must tell us your secret
Best ending GOT can ever get
So regal.
 He has a majestic look
I‚Äôm mostly impressed that you made something for you cat and he‚Äôs actually using it
Love it!

But if it was for my cat, it would iron shreds in a week.
That cat 100% owns the name King.
Meow-carys
This picture is better than season 8
Hey OP could we get a step by step on how to make this? Nice work by the way!
I can only dream to match his current level of confidence.
All laughs and giggles when your cat decided to kill you during dinner
This is MEOWN.
regal af
The Furrst of His Name.
I‚Äôll take one please! Lol. Great job.
Excellent
Still better then season 8
He looks very regal, he wears the name well, and so far is the best choice for the iron throneüò∫
‚ÄúBurn them all‚Äù
Is it better than a cardboard box though?
Very impressive!
He looks very dapper and also like a HUGE kitty.
Too bad this show blows and will be obsolete soon
Wow, I was going to ask where you bought this, it's really cool and well crafted! I see that King Arthur found it rather acceptable and to his liking as well.
The Meow King!
All of these are so good
The regal look of a king!
Not the hugest fan of GoT but the hugest fan of cats, so I approve.

Also, there is just something *right* about a cat being lordly.
When you play the Game of Cats you win or you meow.
He‚Äôs my age. Glad to hear that tbh
Cat of thrones..
What's amazing in this is that you for sure spent a lot of time making this throne, and that your cat is ACTUALLY using it! My cat will always rather lie on a pile of clothes than anything I ever made for him
Holy shit that‚Äôs awesome!
The mad cat
I eat dragon for breakfast.
My Guinevre approves
Wow!
How it should end....
I must say ‚ÄúALL HAIL THE KING‚Äù
This would actually add to the current ongoing plot line that has been season 8.
This is amazing !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Who ever you are I just need you to know that I LOVE YOU .
What a majestic and beautiful cat! That throne is awesome
The things we do for love!
That's amazing!! How did you do it?
If Cersei had a cat, it would be that one. üëèüëèüëè
Aww!
10/10 would pet
He's so regal.
imagine building that and then the cat never sitting on it lol
That is a spitting image of Robert Baratheon (only with Lannister hair).
If i fits...
This is the best version I‚Äôve seen. Meticulous.
Dude - - i think you stole my cat üò¨
Now here's a cat story with some merit! Well done. And (((Bonus Round!!!) the cat is actually using it too.
I knew Tormund was going to rule Westeros.
I shall kneel.
Please crosspost with r/freefolk  :)
This feels apt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEg4SEch27w
One of my dudes is named Merlin, they should hang out
Wow, he really suits that throne.
I would do pretty much anything to make King Arthur happy
Are yal ready to watch COT (cat of thrones)?
"The One True King"
"Gee! You took your time!! (His Royal Highness, King Felix)
Omg I would totally buy this for my cats. You should make more and sell them!
How majestic. How imperial.   The throne is nice too
He is sitting in the throne waaay more comfortable than any other former occupant ever did! 


Wait is this a GOT spoiler?
That's who should rule Westeros!! I bet he won't go mad.
He looks very regal
Purrrrrrfect!!
Treats, Your Highness?
Ser pounce
I SEE YOU KINGS HERE.....
EXCEPT ME
Directions on the build NOW!
With all the fighting and betrayal, no one saw Ser Pounce coming. Long live the Cat King!
Haha aw!!!
What breed is the cat?
This is amazing. If I put in the work to make this though, my cats would still choose the hard ground over this. Just like they do with their expensive pet bed.
I think king Arthur will be on the iron throne in the end of the show, with all the shite the show has been doing in the past 2 seasons I think it's not even unlikely
My cst deserves this but to lazy to make it
You will serve me, human.
Do they come in adult size? Asking for a friend
r/kingarthurwinsthethrone
Ser Pounce was Tommen and Margaery's baby, so technically he is the heir if you don't believe the Jaime Cersei rumours...
Both look great!
What a magnificent looking cat!  He deserves the iron throne and more!
Nice, an elephant would have been more impressive üëçüèª
Long live the king!
So it's a Lannister
17 and still rocking it. What a handsome boy. The chair's pretty cool too.
well deserved for King Arthur
Very smart , since cats like boxes
Catsei
Card board iron? Stop giving mixed signals smh my head
And now the rains weep over their litter boxes.
You must be an artist of some sort. :)
And he deserves that iron throne!
Noble kitty ‚öîÔ∏è
So this is what happens to sir pounce
A king we can all get behind. ‚ù§
That's my wife's cats name
Wow, he certainly looks like a king. Where‚Äôs Excalibur?
OMG! How long did this take you, do you have itsy and how much would you charge for one, lastly SHUTUP AND TAKE MY MONEY!
This is pretty slick. How much does your cat weigh?
I'll happy if the serie ends like this
My god that‚Äôs majestic! Cats and thrones, especially this gorgeous cat.
Khajit has throne if you got crown.
Beautiful!!!!

He‚Äôs beautiful

Doesn't look a day over 10!
Very regal!
Holy crap that's awesome!
You have a golden heartü•∞ü•∞
Majestic
Best Game of Thrones post in quite a while. What a handsome cat.
Now he‚Äôs going to go mad with power and kill you in your sleep
Now make a round table to seat his his knights
He looks so majestic...or annoyed. Not sure which.
This is him [at his castle.](https://imgur.com/a/fFjuFEC)
Spoilers!
We finally know who ends up on the iron throne
Very nicely done üëå.. 
Now we know who sits on Iron Throne at the end
"And it's about time you recognize my eminence"
I'm not sure if it's because of perspective or because he is but that looks like one huge cat. Well done! On the throne, not the huge cat
He got Tywins Lannisters gaze.
this is the best picture ever.
He's quite the Lannister lion.
Worthy of a king! Sweet kitty <3
Weiner, weinerweiner, wienerweiner, weinerweinrer
King Arfurr
Can you make me one? üòÇ
You should now change his name to Purrsei.
Do you take commissions? Because my cat would look amazing in one of those.
Probably has a better claim to the throne than Cersie tbh
How did you make this? Tis wonderful.
So regal
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
Beautiful! And the throne too!
Master of Whiskers
Aww cute cat
Majestic!
He looks like a King Arthur. üëë üò∫
Awesome üñ§ are you taking orders?? :);):) because I would place one!!
That is one majestic floof.
That's obviously Ron Pearlman circa 1987's Beauty and The Beast.
A Lannister always pays his debts.
Majestic boy!
King Cat is not amused

I can‚Äôt find this on Amazon....
Love dis so much
12 year olds: so is it made of cardboard or iron?
What they don't tell you is that they'll pay you less without one using it as justification for not paying you more
That cat only looks 13 :)  He is aging gracefully!
Majestic
The pun game is strong in this comment section
Curious how the direwolves feel about this new purrfect king...
Still probably a better ending than Game of Thrones
Haha he kind of looks like Tywin for some reason
Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!
This is awesome! Curious why you didn't make King Authur's Throne for you cat King Authur?
Do you know what breed he is?
lord of purrs
Damn Lannister‚Äôs, with their blonde hair and smug faces
Long may he reign
Is the big cat still here?
How is so much creativity even possible
Dude straight up looks like tywin
What did you paint it with?
He is a regal king!! ‚ù£Ô∏èüê±üíñüëëüëëüëë
This was an awesome idea that makes a great picture. Bravo
SpoilerAlert! Dammit man, tag your post!
Amazing craftsmanship! Such a majestic little being!
If only season 8 was as majestic as this wonderful boy
Omg i want a tutorial for this
Never expected Tormund to take the Throne
I love how aware he looks
That's amazing!
She's a total Cersei.
Majestic as fuck.
u/afklay
That looks like it was really hard
The cat won the game of thrones
"The King is tired. See him to his Chambers." "Err M'lord, he's already asleep on the Queen's lap."
HB your highness
If I fits, I sits
Wow, doesn't he just look positively regal on there? You can almost here him thinking - *well it's about damn time*. Exceptional work!
He‚Äôs like, ‚Äúfinally‚Äù
The real king is here
Still a better ending than whatever D&D ejaculated on to the horse excrement they call a season 8 script.
He is gorgeous!
he rules me
Nice job hound lol
Mr Majestic.
Due to possible spoilers as I am only on season 3, I won‚Äôt scroll down to find an answer. What breed cat is that?
Nice job man.  I tried to forge a cardboard throne from the fire of dragons but then my house burned down.
Most awesome cat parent.
That is so cool!!
What a beauty!
I want to see a dark grey pit bull playing The Mountain.
That fur is ready for winter
Arthur the once and future cat
Does look like a king
Fantastic! üòÑ
why does the cat have the same expression as Cersei LOL
Meowelous!!
THIS. IS. AMAZING.
You did Good Op!
Fucking majestic.
The story of your cat posing for this photo is probably better than season 8
Wow, he is absolutely beautiful. Treated like a king, rightfully so.
Yes
 Long may he meow.
Damn that‚Äôs cool!!!!
The true miracle is that he's sitting *in* the chair and not next to it or underneath of it.
too bad GOT shit the throne
Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know...

Seriously though, how'd you convince him to sit there?
He looks very Regal!
make them and sell,I'll buy!
Sell????
I absolutely love this! How clever, and he is quite regal and precious!
I hope you made a video of the process
Honestly I would take this ending over what‚Äôs happening on the show right now.
That's one of the most gorgeous cat's I've ever seen. What breed is it? I know nothing about cats.
Perfect timing.
r/ronperlmancats
This is so awesome!
He doesn't look a day over ten.
Wow he has the face of a king
Looks like a lion, must be a Lannister!
That cat really does look like a king.
So now we know who wins.
Really cool  !   Beautiful job and regal cat looks good there.
Where is my crown? meow! kneel down to your queen
Dracattis üî•
That's nice. Have my upvote
I don't know what I admire more, your cat, your artistic skill, or the patience it must have taken to build that thing.
King arthur or Aegon Catgaryen?
WOW. This rocks!
I think I speak for everyone when I say that this is really the best way they could have ended the show.
hear me roar!  
did Bran ever learn that? guess he knows everything now
What an amazing idea, I love it! I‚Äôm going to do this :‚Äô)
'And who are you'
The proud lord spoke, 
'That I must bow so low?'...
The last of his line, I'm afraid. A Lannister always spays his pets.
Cooooool
Love it üòÅüëç
Fluffing majestic
That's actually amazing
Litter is coming!
You either rename your cat Ser Pounce or you die
In the game of boxes you fits...and you sits.
the Lannisters always repay their pets
Beautiful
I can't tell if the chair is small or the cat is huge.  On a scale from Arya Stark to Gregor Clegane, exactly how big is this cat?
He is fit for The Throne
Is there more cardboard underneath? I saw how the top part was done. We are GOT fans with a pretentious cat. Lol think this is a super cute idea for the cardboard loving king of the house.
Main Coon?  How big is the giant floof?
He is majestic as fuck
That is awesome
He‚Äôs so regal!
The true heir to the Bone Throne...
Even Ghost wouldn‚Äôt try it with this guy
thats so badass
That's a great idea! I want to do the same thing now

This is awesome on so many different levels!
Wow! That's awesome, what a lucky furball!
King PsPsPs, from House Meow
I'm pawsitive he likes it
Majestic
He looks so handsome! Like he belongs there on his throne.
That cat is more badass than me.
If you made these for sale, I'd buy one in A HEARTBEAT.
cat face, lion body.
That's awesome and so is he
Wow that is so cool
Still better than Daenerys.
boss!
Effortlessly regal, of course.
He liked it better when it was just a box.
I approve
I have just unsubscribed from r/NobodyWinsTheThrone
That is exactly how Cercei looks like on the throne.
Whoa, you‚Äôre very talented!
Such a noble beasty
That Cat is the king of the house hold. As it should be.
That is awesome!
majestic as heck
Long may he reign
And he actually sits on it
Lord Plushbottom
Holy crap, that's incredible. How did you build that?

Also, it looks totally fitting!
When duty calls this cat rides into battle fully ironclad. Where is his armor?
thats a BIG cat.
House words: Hear Me Purr!
Game of Litter Boxes
Holding court like a boss.

That a Maine Coon?
That's a regal looking cat right there.
This works for me as the ending for GOT.
A... Lannister on the Iron Throne?

What madness is this?

You can tell by the golden hair
Ser Pounce is clearly Azor Ahai reincarnated.
A Lannister always purrs his pets.
I know it's a boi

but he gives me Cersei's vibes.
Did he forget about Euron?
DRACARIS!
If it fits, it Rules over Westeros.
If I fits, I sits!
Cat's aren't good for much (source: owned many cats).  They are, however, able to strike a Majestic Pose at will, which can make for some great photos.
Looks like a lannister

Reminds me of [this photo :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
King arthur wasnt in game of thrones
Knowing my cat, if I did this for him, he wouldn't use it
Did you pay the Gold Price, or the cardboard price?
Your fucked now. üòÑ You'd be shit in game of thrones..
Wrong show dumbass
You are now his hooman
Could care less about an obviously spoiled cat. and GOT long ago jumped the shark.   Man that awesome.  Is that industrial cardboard? 

Just looked again and that cat seems worthy in tude. So well done, but shouldn't the perch,  point towards the street or is he busy watching GOT.
I'd name it cersei. Just gives that kinda feel.
