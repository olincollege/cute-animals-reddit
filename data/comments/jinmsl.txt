Gorgeous! She looks so sweet and gentle.
OMG, she's so cute!
Good girl ❤️
Sorry guys there’s so many comments that I can’t reply to all of them 💙. Thank you everyone for the rewards and I hope you will have a great day.
I said goodbye to my almost 14 year old good boy yesterday. I knew it was coming, but it didn’t stop me from trying to do CPR when I found him. I was there when he was born and took his first breath, and I was there when he took his last. They are precious. Please give her a big hug from me.
Such a happy baby! So cute!
So cute
That's the best dog face ever!
She’s so precious!!
Best friend, always loyal and there for you
We all love this good girl.
You need to fix your cabinets
This girl has seen some shit
Please hug her tightly. We lost our old lady this month and still don't know how to orientate our lives. Hug her tightly and treat her often. She has very kind eyes. 💜
She looks like a very very good girl!! I love her sweet eyes

She's beautiful!
Awwww what a sweet beautiful girl!! Look at that smile ❤️❤️
I have two dogs, and the oldest is 16 and a half now and she is slowing wayyyyyy down, but if there has been any positive from this pandemic for me it has been the 8 months I've been working from home and spending time with her every single day for 24 hours straight pretty much.
Not to be dramatic but I would die for her
Sweet old girl!! Remember, anyone can get a pup, but it takes a good dogperson to get a happy, healthy old dog! I love her.
Such a cutie
And that smile at you!! Y’all are so lucky to have had so much time together
Truly an awwww.
Such a sweetheart.....bestest girl.......
Such a good looking pupper

Hug her everyday, I just had to put my old husky pup down this week and I miss him dearly. Breaks my heart.
You usually won’t get a better dog than the one that saw you grow up. Give her a good last few years and cherish your time.
Cherish this beautiful girl. Childhood dogs are something else
Aw, she looks happy :)
Remember a dog is only a part of your life,but your its whole life

That's the happiest smile! She's the best doggo in the whole world!
That is the face of a Good Girl.

Dude, that good girl is going to be with you for the rest of your life, and most likely whatever awaits for you afterwards.
She's beautiful.
She looks like she has a great attitude. I bet she’s a princess

Such a pretty lady 🐺
Please hug her everyday
What a gentle looking soul, give her all the huge and kisses
She looks like the sweetest little lady!  Oh I just want to give her endless scritches. 😘❤️
Looks like such a gentle soul 🥺
Give her a hug for me. I lost my buddy end of March. Still reach over to pet him:(.
She has the same kind and gentle face as the dog I grew up with ❤ what a wonderful thing it is to experience the beginning of life with someone who loves you so much
In the immortal words of Mark Twain: "The more I learn about people, the more I like my dog."

Tell this good girl she's an angel.
Old friends are the best friends. My cat turned 14 this summer and has been around me for more than half my life. She’s my bestie through thick and thin and I’m honored I get the privilege of caring for her and making sure her health ailments don’t make her miserable. She knows she’s loved and that means I’m doing something right.
What a good old girl ☺️ she looks lovely
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️this made me cry. Those old eyes that look at you with wisdom and love, the puppy eyes are great but those eyes- that’s what make me really miss my bestfriend Ronja. Three years and the tears are still rolling
The old dog barks backwards without getting up. I can remember when she was a pup. - Robert Frost

Definitely needs more award's.  

Cute puppy though!
Beautiful ol pupper!  Reminds me a lot of my old lady doggo who is 15 and just the absolute sweetest thing ever born. 
Cheers to more good times with your ol doggo!
Pet the girl <3
I wish she could read so she could see all the people who thinks she's such a good girl!
How old is she ❤️
Enjoy every second you with her. My boy just past with no signs after 11. It’s so heartbreaking. I’ll forever my miss my buddy and my shadow.
She looks like such a humble dog she’s gorgeous
Awww. She looks so tired, but I bet every morning she wakes up is the happiest day of her existence because it's one more day she gets to spend with her loved ones :) She's the goodest of girls.
Makes me miss my dog, Kia was my best friend for so long, not a day goes by that I don't miss her. But she lived a long and happy life, and I hope yours lives the same
Omg love her. Is she a husky or a Mal?
Love senior dogs. She’s still so pretty. Your lucky to have had such a sweet companion with you all these years. ❤️
I'm not allowed to like this 50 times or I would.
Smell the top of her head. Appreciate every second you have with her. I lost my old man October 19th and he’d been with me since I was 5 years old, and it hurts even to write this. You’re so fortunate to still have her to hold
Enjoy every moment.  Iost my little man 2 weeks ago and picked up his urn today.  Even though he was 17, it's never enough.
She had lived a dam good life :) what a good friend
Hello cutie pie dog! I love you!
They are the sweet and non-judging witnesses to our lives.  She is lucky to have you too!
She is so beautiful what breed is she?
Bless her.
She’s a gorgeous old girl, i have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel who’s 14, he looks like such and old man now but hes still just as adorable as when he was a puppy and he’s still so damn greedy with his food lol, i wish dogs lasted as long as cats, i loved that my cat lasted until the grand age of 24, really wish dogs could last that long.
What a beautiful, happy girl!
And you’ve probably been here for all of hers
give the ol' girl some good pats on the head for me, will you?
This always breaks my heart for so many different reasons. Happy and sad. As George Carlin used to say, “getting a dog, is like adopting a tragedy.” I always like to add, “but damn, the journey and the love and joy that comes with it, makes it all well worth it!”
Thats a confirmed good girl.
I'm 12 and I have a 13 year old husky called missy she is a VERY good girl my mum got her as a puppy before i was born and we have kept one dog from every litter one called Akeno and one called Bruce.
Missy has cancer but is still going Husky are amazing and won't hurt a fly (but will chase deers and rabbits) :)




BTW she is beautiful tell her she's a good girl
This is the most precious dog I have ever fucking seen in my entire life. Please tell her she is beautiful.
You can see the gentleness of her soul!
Old dogs is best people!
Olden doggos are the bestest doggos.
That’s a real life partner. Solid friend.
It's a cruel joke that their lives are so short. I miss my Rottie Clyde every day.
My 1st dog lived to be 18 .. his named was Oscar .. I was 22 when he died .. I jumped the graveyard fence and buried him next to my grandfather his favorite lap buddy .. I’m 36 now and I put flowers on both of there graves on there birthday
Aww what a cutie
cute 🥰
we don’t deserve floofsters love
Sweet
Never met her but I love her
She’s a husky for those who are wondering
Uh ma'am that's a possum.
The prettiest smile
I dont know why this got so popular but I also dont know why this wont be popular. I am truly confused
Man, I’m having trouble with my garbage cabinet door too. It gets so much use!
Awwww. The best girl.
“Have you eaten yet?”
That face definitely says

"What is it we're doing again? Oh, I love pictures."
r/goschnoodlego
Henlo thar!
Good Boy and Good Girl dogs have taught me that being called a Good Boy or Good Girl human really shouldn't be considered an insult.
I hope you've made her as happy as she has made you.  Be there at the end, make sure of this.
fuck man we dont deserve dogs
:)
♥️♥️♥️
Great girl

❤ Give her an extra treat for us. She deserves it!

Just looking at this picture I can tell she’s such a kind doggy. You’re a lucky owner, OP.
Such a beautiful girl and I am sure without a doubt faithful.
My dog bites me every day just because he thinks it’s funny. HE LAUGHS. He bites be and then makes this MineCraft villager noise like he’s laughing at me.
Wow... I love this dog so much. Such kindness and gratefulness in those eyes. Thank you for giving this girl a loving home!
Those ears! I just want to smoosh that face 😊
Nice
And you’ve been there for all of hers :)

Bark bark bark

And she will be there for you all of hers
I'm saving this poem for my 13 year old man. He's the best but showing his age.
I saved this post so I can come see her face when I’m feeling sad.
What a sweetheart of a friend!!! Please give her many hugs and kisses from me. Just a plain ol ordinary guy that loves all animals!
THE GOODEST GIRL I LOVE HER SO MUCH
She is so perfect! Give her so much love.

Don't forget, you've been there for her too. ❤️
You are also a good hooman.  Cheers and respect
I love her
Why do I have the sudden urge to protect this dog at all costs?
Thats the face of a grandma. Betcha she would invite you to cookies and tea if she could <3 such a sweet girl.
Been grooming dogs for over 10 years. It's really rare to see an old husky. Most people give up on them after the first couple years due to extreme shedding and behavior issues. Kudos to you for taking good care of her ♥️
I love her face!
it’s pretty much impossible to beat the love and devotion of a good dog.  if only people were as awesome as our “four legged friends”.
Holy crap that dog looks like she truly cares about EVERYTHING. I'm jelly...my dog likes to be called "dog" and doesnt really bother you unless she wants something or knows you're not okay. Like today when i pinched a nerve in my back at work, when i got home she came up like "ya know what you need? To pet DOG!"  LoL...but she doesnt have the kind eyes like yours does...its rare to have a dog like that find you. Mine is good, but it doesnt get much better than yours...
Love
Good of the
So pretty and such kind eyes ...
I love her so much.  My cat is Little Girl!!! (Close to Good girl!)
Awwww what a wholesome pupper
She’s the GOODEST girl 😍
I love her.  Give her a big hug for me.
Omg her earsssssss! I love them!!
A very pretty lady
Good lord, that was well written! Nice one, Schnoodle.

Sweet baby

Serious grandma vibes, i love her
Love her. So huggable. Give her an extra hug for me
Aw, she’s a precious pup. I just recently put down my old pupper. It was exactly 2 weeks before her 14th birthday. She was 2 months older than me and I had her with me the day I was born. I miss her so much. Take care of your pup and cherish that bond forever.
So cute!  I wish I was home more so I could find my own furry companion!
She looks like the dog version of the sweet grandma everyone loves who bakes fresh cookies every week 🥰
Her smile is kind but her eyes speak only of the void
What a beautiful smile ❤️
Give that girl a treat❤
She’s beautiful!!
What a precious beautiful girl ❤️ I love her so much ❤️
German Shepherd/Husky?

Please cross post this to r/oldmandog OP!
Such a sweet looking girl! My old boy has been with me a little more than half my life - 15 years. He’s very sick now and will be passing on this week unfortunately. It’s killing me inside to see my best friend for so long pass, especially when I haven’t had many human friends along the way. Thanks for sharing this photo!❤️
 I miss my dog, glad yours is still kickin.
What breed?
She’s a puppy!!!
Awwwww, she’s so cute and beautiful, no joke!! 😍🥰❤️
Give her a hug 4 me
She’s beautiful and that smile!!
Look at that bright white smile.
Happy go lucky puppy doggy!!!
What a dog!
Nawwww look at this Goodest of girls, she has such a kind loving face. Give her a cuddle from all of us :D
Sweet old lady
Everyone thinks they have the best dog, and none of them are wrong!
Precious
Sweetest girl award 💙
Such a cutie!!
This sweetheart looks so similar to my sweetheart that I had to say goodbye to about 6 months ago.  Life has changed, there is a cavern in my heart now.  I miss him dearly, as it was 14 years we spent together and I will never have a better friend.
She has the *sweetest* face!!!
Give her lots of treats and belly rubs.
As a husky owner i can confirm, they are the bestest of puppers
I could pets
My husky is a bit younger but she's my best girl. They may be the best and sweetest dogs on earth.
Old and still smiling, warms my heart :’)
I thought she had a knife in her mouth! The carpet pattern threw me off.
r/confusingperspective
My yellow lab was with me most of my life and had the same face. We had to put her down in February but we got 15 years out of that great girl. I grew up with her. I miss her
Such a sweet girl, this made me miss our good boy.
Pretty baby
She looks like the bestest girl ❤️❤️
She looks like one of those good dogs that like to play bite on your arm, but are super gentle about it. Lol Idk
Give that girl pets and hugs.
I want to send my condolences but also congratulate you for being a great dog owner for all or most of your life.  People too easily congratulate people for getting a new puppy. It’s easy to get a new puppy.  It takes a special  person to raise a dog to the end and give them a great life.
she cute
Such a kind smile
This dog is an angel
That's the face of a pupper that had a wonderful and loving life. Thanks for sharing!
Sweetiiiiie🤍
That’s the face Grandma makes when she offers you a  plate of cookies. 🥰
Miss my dog. She pass away last month. It was good being with her for 6 years. Cherish your time together
What a friend!
They are truly irreplaceable, i have my little dog now for almost 18 years! She has her ups and downs last 2 years but she’s still going strong!
Reminds me of a sweet wolf/husky mix I grew up with. She was the kindest dog ever.
What a beautiful best friend. 💕
Omg such a good girl! Tell her that for me plz ☺️
Heckin woof ❤️
5 years ?
And she will be here for the rest of it cuz dogs live forever.
she looks a bit old but super sweet, like a nice grandma that would knit you a sweater "just because "
This is precious
I had my first boy from 3yo to 19yo. His name was Simba and he was my bubby. I loved that dog so much and he was an angel. I miss him every day and I do my best to remember him by giving my monsters all the love I can.
Good Gurl
Awww 😊
She’s a beaut ❤️
And you've been around all of her life...
What a sweet happy face ❤️
Awh what a beautiful smile :)
And she will be with you for the rest of your life
Huh, I guess angels do exist :)

Cutest thing I've seen saala
She’s so cute 🥺
She’s so gorgeous!!
Goodest <3
Having lost his beloved Draupadi and all his brothers along the way through the Himalayas, with only his companion the Dog remaining by his side, one day Lord Indra appeared in his chariot before Yudhistira.

Because Yudhistira was the most pious of the brothers and had never strayed from the path of Dharma, Indra wished to now take him directly to the heavens in his human form. At first, Yudhistira refused to enter the chariot without Draupadi and his brothers, but Indra assured him that they were already in the spiritual world, and he would again meet them there. Yudhistira then asked to take the Dog along in the chariot, but Indra strongly objected. Saying that because food is taken sitting on the floor, it is not possible to have a dog roaming in the same place. Indra also indicated that the Dog would defile Heaven, and it is considered that the mere glance of a dog deprives deity offerings of their consecration.

Yudhistira, however was adamant: he would not go without the Dog, who had been entirely devoted to him. It was the Dog who had remained loyal at the time of his great losses of Draupadi and each brother. Saying he could not be happy in Heaven, because he would be haunted by thoughts of the Dog who had remained so loyal to him, Yudhistira refused Indra's offer.

Soon after, the Dog transformed into Dharma, the God of righteousness. This had been the final test for Yudhistira, who to the very end, never swayed from the path of Dharma. He thus enjoyed the rare honour of reaching heaven in the human form.
She is in pain every day becas dogs whene thay get old are like humans thay get a lot of vires
I LOVE HER
I've never seen such a face on a dog. Like a little bit tired but full of dedication to wholesomely care about someone. When I think about the face that you've been together almost all of you lives, no other picture could better show what good friendship means.
Good grief
Kiss her forehead!!!
She’s beautiful, definitely looks like she’s a good girl. Make me miss my girl she passed away from breathing problems, an laid in my lap through her last moments. ❤️
Awe man, she looks so happy to see you grow up.
Pet and hug her for me, please!
She looks a lot like my dog :) (husky mix whose large ears that do not stand up give her away. So because your dogs ears no longer stand up she looks a lot more like my dog than most huskies).
She looks immensely sweet. <3
The older it gets, the better the taste
Op im sorry for bringing this up and being the "gloomy guy" but one day you are going to lose your friend. So make it count and you won't have a second chance, so remember that nothing lives forever.
You say shes been there for most of your life but dont forget, you’ve been there for her whole life. 😌
She's the goodest of girls
Look at this happy old woman! She deserves many pets and kisses
Thank you good friend
She looks so cuddly and happy. I don’t know her but I love her
The goodest girl
It's 0200 and I just whistled for my 6 year old German Shepherd to come get a hug because of this picture. Dogs are the best
That good girl deserves you.
Is she still there for you?
❤️❤️❤️❤️
It looks just like a happy puppy
She just wants the love. Sweetheart. Happy to see another beautiful pup enrich another life. Currently enjoying everything that 19 year old twins had to give. But only half as strong. "Bunz" passed but Kaeda is still making smiles. Have to be grateful for them as long as we have them.
I look at that girl and I want to pet her and nuzzle her and curl up and nap hugging her.  Like. She a fuss magnet.
Such a sweet face
What's her name? I love her smile.
Ma heart
Aww
A beautiful popper you have! Give her a kiss for me please ♥️
Older dogs are so much sweeter than puppies.
I love husky

They are the best
And she been with you for all her life! Shes a beauty
Beautiful girl!
My mom's cat is turning 18 soon and ive had him since I was 7 years old. I've already warned my employer I'll be using a personal day for whenever it happens. Luckily he's healthier than ever somehow so it won't be anytime soon.
So damn cute
Deserved all the treatos
100000/10 good girl!
Ice age
Ear scritches!
Wait is she dead
im guessing she died?
An angel she’s so beautiful
Dogs will always be better than hoomans!
So cute
Aw
she looks like she wants to offer me a side quest
Awe what a sweetie, you can tell you guys are very best buds, do much love in that face 🥰🥰🥰
I know how that feels I lost my hedgehog last month
Look at that adorable face.
🥰
So sweet. It is hard when they leave us behind💕
That’s the look my grandma gives me when I come visit
Thank you kind strangers for the rewards :D
God bless this beautiful creature
a beauty ✨
Old dogs have such a distinctive, similar look to them.
She needs more upvotes! Bless her old soul❤
What a sweetie 😩 give her a warm hug from a stranger who loves her
This unremarkable picture of an ordinary dog gets to the top of reddit.  What?
She gon die soon and you gon be all alone
Reminds me of my old lab. Had him for 14 years. He went downhill so quick and was in so much pain. My parents couldn't afford to put him down, so when I left after a winter break, my Dad covered him in his favorite blanket in the backyard, and then stuck a revolver behind his floppy ear and put him down. My dad called me crying, saying "his tail kept wagging for a minute afterwards, as if to say 'thank you daddy.'"

It's been years and I'm still not over it.

parents and pets, love them while you have them.
Your cabinet door bothers me. Lol
I’m almost afraid to ask….is this sweet girl still with you?
All of these dog posts are bullshit. They’re not even interesting breeds or anything.
It’s time to go
Remember your dog will endure incredible pain for you. Doesnt mean they should have to.
I am a liar

She is disgustingly ugly
Anyone else say lying about ownership? I've seen this before I swear
