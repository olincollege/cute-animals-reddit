Ha. I can relate. My entire childhood I begged for a dog. Once I moved away to college my parents got a puppy and forever after referred to it as my dog. Gee, thanks guys. 
You should come visit to see your replacement 
Perfect time to get your own cat :)
I feel you. My whole childhood it was "no, your sister has allergies" as soon as I went to college, boom, she got a cat. 
Screw visiting!  It's time to move back in for that fluff! :D
I asked for a puppy for every birthday and Christmas from the age of 6 until 16. Every year my parents told me no. 

I left home at 17. Within six months of my moving out, both my Mom and Dad (divorced now) got puppies. I'll never fully forgive them.
This will be me after my husband dies. He won‚Äôt let me have a cat. Last time he irritated me I told him he wouldn‚Äôt be cold in the morgue before I was adopting a Siamese kitten.
She knows you like cats. It is to bait you to visit her often.
My entire childhood my brother, 3 years younger, and I asked for a dog. My father always had a reason not to get one; "We are going to move in a year." "The lot is too small. Our next house will have a bigger yard." "Take care of the neighbor's dog."

So we end up with a sister 17 years younger than me. Within a few years, she has a dog. I confront my father, "Dad, my entire life I asked for a dog and you never got me one. How did she get a dog?" Dad replies, "She asked for a sister."
My moms blue tip himi is as prissy as she looks....If anyone touches she immediately goes to find some place to go clean herself.

Then she has what was suppose to be a ragdoll cat. It's some kind of goliath cat. We figure he has to be mixed with Maine Coon. Most docile, comatose cat you'll ever pick up.
Get your own cat and send her a picture with "nah, i'm good".
You have been momipulated! This is how she makes you come and visit more often. Your mom loves you very much. Go visit her more often.
My mom did this with a dog. I wanted a dog for 23 years. I moved 2000 miles away and its like "oh hey we just happened to walk by the shelter that's 40mins out of the way and accidently bring home a new friend, he's totally getting your room."
oh, she is cruel
Feeling of love and hate all wrapped at once
Tell her "You curbed me of my love for cats, with a lot of effort. Call sometime!"
My MIL didn't let my wife have animals when she was young and she didn't let her eat snacks or sweets. She got divorced and now she live next to us with 2 cats and eats junk foods almost everyday. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
The kitteh gets my upvote. Your Mum not so much. Why do parents always do that shit??
What a sweet little face!! Do you know what kind of kitten he/she is?
My birman cat also looked fluffy when he was a kitten and then he got [a permanent bitch face](https://i.imgur.com/9kc9zwX.jpg) :/ 
I would actually be angry.
It's adorable but honestly I'd be kind of pissed at my mom over this.
Visit and then steal it
Really blue eyes.
Better than my dad, "Hey I think we should get a cat." "Why? I am allergic to cats..." Comes home the next day with two cats.
Kinda makes sense a bit though, she probably wouldn't have minded a pet the whole time but simply refused to be cajoled into a situation whereby *she* inevitably became the responsible party for its feeding, welfare, training etc after young you got bored, or got scratched, or  
"but mum! I *have* to leave right this very second...I think Jimmy's gonna be at this party and Maddy told me he *like* likes me! Can't you feed Felix just this once? I plomise you'll never have to again ^((until at least tomorrow)^)" happened, or some variation of the above.

Now that she's on her own the house feels empty and she wants something to care for, and won't feel unenthusiastic about doing so with this little ball of floof because it was her idea to get one, not her children's
Oh my, that is one gorgeous kitty!
Why? Thant not cool
Clean that cats eyes!
what breed is that? Im getting one rn
I would be pissed instead.
You should ask your mom she has room left for you. You'll never leave after this cutey
my mom did the same, except with cable tv. still bugs me.
I didn‚Äôt know a cat could be prettier than me. 
I hate when parents pull this crap.

We always wanted a cat when we were growing up and my dad always said no. Parents split up, brother goes to live with dad, a cat of a person they know has kittens. Brother was allowed to have 2 of the kittens. Wut.
That's called emotional blackmail.
Trollmom strikes again #2011.  Beautiful cat btw.
"I'm moving back in." 
Almost the same thing with my dog. She never let us have one for 23 years but the day after she said, "I will consider it", there was a pup at home :) 
You were her cat.
Yo no lie I‚Äôd actually be pissed. That‚Äôs fucked
I just want to let you know I am *screaming* internally at this.
Plot twist: OP tortured animals as a child.
Am I the only one who is more pissed at mom? 
This means that YOU were her cat.
I bet this is gonna be the top of the week at r/titlegore 
you were the cat 
This is actually pretty rude and messed up on her part. 
D‚Äôawww!! Yeah same thing happened to me. I move out, get a cat. 2 years later move back home with cat for 6 months the between places. Mom was all ‚Äú get that thing out of here‚Äù. I move out, she begs me to let her keep him.  10 years later she tells anyone who would listen that I ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù my cat with her üôÑ 
It's a trick. Send no reply.
I wanted a horse my whole life. I moved out and she bought one for my sister. 
[That‚Äôs bait.](https://youtu.be/ThJcHjCI9j4)
It‚Äôs a strategy. You‚Äôre way more likely to visit more often now. Parenting at it‚Äôs finest (sleaziest).
I think she just really wants you to visit.
My mom did pretty much the same thing, but with a dog. 
Rag dolls are the best!
Sue for mental abuse
Moms can only handle feeding, cleaning, and caring for so many animals at a time. You left, opened up a spot for kitty!
Ok seriously, why do parents do this?
The force is strong with your mom. Guaranteed a visit from her children. What an adorable little floof!
OP, reverse the picture and send it back, "You too."
My parents never let us have pets when we were kids. After moving out, one of my sisters adopted a cat. Three years later, she moved to New York City and my parents grudgingly took her cat. It is now ten years later, my sister has since moved to a home where she could easily take the cat. Cat still lives with mom and dad.
My mom did this to me. Bought a dog instead.... I moved back in
/r/SupermodelCats - she‚Äôs gorgeous, and that‚Äôs a great photo :)
That‚Äôs too funny! My mom did basically the same thing! My whole life I wanted a dog, but was told we could never have one. A month or so into me moving away to go to university, my mom messages me in the middle one of my classes and tells me she‚Äôs coming to pick me up with my brother to pick out a puppy üê∂ 
For 20 years, YOU were the cat.
My mom was the same, she didn't let us have anything bigger than a turtle, but I always wanted a cat or dog. One day I find our local stray has had litter of little floofs, and she seems to have left onr behind. So I say fuck it and I take this little kitten home. At first she was freaking out and she told me to get that thing out of the house and that she wouldn't take care of it when I was away. Fast forward to not a day later when my mom is falling asleep on the couch with the cat bunched up on her stomach. The kitteh eventually ran away and my mom got really sad and blamed herself for not showing her enough love.
I dont know if you ll read this. As a kid Mom didnt allow to have a dog of my own. I have her move in with me to take care of her when shes older. I decide to get a dog, she didnt want to live with one. When I come back from work on the first day, I find him at her feet and she is making a bed for him instant besties.
My mom did the exact same thing with a Chihuahua puppy! All I ever wanted was a little dog and she got one two months after I moved out....
Am I misunderstanding the OP? It says that their mom are the ones who moved away and then got a cat for her new place (evil), not that the kid moved away and mom got a cat for the empty nest (cute).


She needs to entice you to travel 900km away now that she's feeling like an empty nester.
My mom was "allergic" to dogs growing up. My parents now have two dogs that sleep in bed with them...
Your mom is a genius. Now you have to visit her more often.  
I can't tell if I'm damaged or jaded, but the first time I saw this title I read it as:.  

Kid asks mom for cat.   

Mom moves away.   

~20 years later   
    
Mom invites kid over to visit   
Kid sends mom a pic of cat    
    
Then I reread it and thought the mom sent the cat pic, and Im like "oh wow she remembers after 20 years".   
   
Then I reread it *again * and realized I'm an idiot.

i bet if your mom knew this picture was gonna be trending on reddit and seen by thousands....she would have cleaned that eye booger off the kitten before she took this. 
My seventeen years old passed away in my mother's arms last year. She said we were never getting another cat again. Five months, and one blurry camera phone picture later, we have two kittens.
When I moved out they finally ditched their AOL dial up for DSL.  ~ 15 years or so ago  
So the real answer was "No. ***YOU*** cannot get a cat that lives with me. But I can get a cat for myself."
My Mom was super opposed to the idea of an indoor cat. She finally begrudgingly agreed when I was 16, but complained about it until I moved out after graduation. Came home for Thanksgiving (October) 2 months later and she had gotten two cats because she missed mine!
I demand that you steal this fluffs!
We never had animals growing up. As soon as I moved out my Mom got 2 cats, a dog and a bird.


Let me give you the parents perspective:

Kid: Mom, I want a cat!

Mom: (thinks: I work my ass off to take care of these kids and now they want me to get them another thing I need to take care of?  Screw that...)  
Mom: Who's going to feed it and clean the kitty litter?

Kid: I totally will!

Mom: (sarcasm) Suuuuure you will...

*Kid moves out of house*

Mom: I need something to take care of...I can finally get that cat I've always wanted!
You should have a child and send her that photo
This is actually pretty fucked up, honestly. While, sure, the kitty is cute as hell it's also messed up that your mom got a cat when she's denied you one your entire life. WHY would she even want one at this point?

Seems like she's trying to spite you in a way. Cute cat, just don't care for the topic I suppose...
Okay am I the only one who would be genuinely a little upset about this? 
Your mum misses you, you wanted a cat so bad that the cat reminds her of you and always the chance you come to visit the little fluffy ball so she can see you. 

Atleast that is what I think the reason is.
This just means your mum misses you and is supplementing her love for you with a cat. Honestly, you should feel loved that your mum misses you so much.

.... either that, or you were the problem. 
Yep. Parents did the same, but with a pool. Wanted a pool all my life. They move 70km away to a place with a pool. It's incentive for us kids to visit them more. 
She's an ass 
I bet it works :)
I'm kind of shocked at how many people here were denied a pet their whole lives, only for their parents to buy a pet the second they move out.

It's kind of dickish in a way, isn't it?
Maybe she got the cat to remind her of you.
Fuck you mom!
What a way to tell someone, "I don't trust you around animals."
I've always wanted a cat, finally adopted one a couple of years ago, couldn't be happier now. Just saying :)
Ugh, my parents did this with a dog.

OMG those eyes though!
It's a trap! Probably not even her cat -- she just wants you to visit ;) 
Newb cat owner mistake, those earbuds are gonna be toast!
"But you said we could never get a cat!"

"That's right, but I never said *I* couldn't get a cat."
This happened to me when I moved away for college. My whole life I wanted a cat or dog. Mom never wanted one. Almost immediately after I moved away she got a cat and a dog.
She actually doesn't own a cat.  She's just calling you over so you can put the video tape into the VCR, so she can watch Titanic.  And you can't get mad at her 'cause she's your mom so all you can do is stomp loudly as you leave the house and scream internally on the plane back home.
Is a trap 
We got our first cat last week. My parents would never have pets in the house. Now its my house! I have a gorgeous 7 year old cat with wonky legs and FIV and I've never been happier to see someone when I get home.
My dad did the same thing...but it was a riding lawn mower and not a cat. Still hurts :/
It looks just like my last cat R.I.P Chantilly
IT'S A TRAP!
"You were the cat". 
-the Mum
Today OP learned they were the cat all along.
It was all planned. She knew when u grew up and moved out shed need some kind of bait to make u visit, so she put off getting a cat till u moved out just so now ud be forced to visit. Its all part of the plan!
You've been replaced by a cat ...
op can't move back in fast enough
Spoilers: You were the Cat
My BF was never allowed to have a dog because his father ‚Äûhated‚Äú them so much. Then we got a Golden Retriever and he loves that dog so much that he decided to get one to keep him company when he retires. It‚Äôs been heart warming to watch him discover that place in his heart :)
My dad wouldn't let us get a cat.


The day he died, my mum says to me "You can have a cat now."


Yeah, think I might wait a day or two.
My mom for the last 25 years: "I will never get a long haired cat!!" Two years ago: "well, that's more medium hair. Look how cute she is!"
I know your pain. My parents refused to get a dog my entire childhood. I've had multiple awesome dogs since moving out 20 years ago. When I want to go visit my folks, it costs around $200 in dogsitters. 

ONE TIME my parents had one of their old friends over, and he had his dog in the car with him. Now there's a pooper-scooper AND treats in our garage. I'm still not allowed to bring my pup. It's an angry fist shake every time I walk by it. 
Gorgeous cat 
Mum is bribing you with kitten cuddles. My mom uses beer to the same effect. 
Growing up, I really wanted a kitten, a horse, and an electric Barbie jeep. My dad refused them all and was very, very mean when my mom and I brought home a cat.

20 years later he's on kitten/cat number four with his second wife, horse number 2, and they're on the waiting list for an electric off-road vehicle. 
same thing happen to me I always asked for a dog or cat when I was a kid and my parents always refused. When I moved out of home to the university they got a dog! Not that im jealous or anything, I love the dog, but what the hell is up with that?! 
Those headphones in the background are gonna get destroyed I can almost guarantee.
Damn thats cold...
‚ÄúYou should come visit me‚Äù in Mom‚Äôs language means:‚ÄúI have something that you‚Äôve always wanted, now come back home‚Äù.
What if you steal the cat?
My parents never went anywhere cool on vacation when I lived at home and next vacation after I moved out they traveled to Easter Island
https://youtu.be/2hXgAYku2PA
My parents did this with a dog! And then within 4 years they had 4 dogs!!! 
Can you tell your mom to send more pictures, we need more pictures, it's important.
Wanted a dog my whole childhood. Got every excuse as to why we cant have a dog.  I go away to school, mother gets a dog. And then she raises a seeing eye dog, and now she is on her 3rd dog. -_-
She only got the cat because it matches the bedding. 
Yeah, you should visit your mom once every two months at that distance. Hope you're calling her weekly too. She love you bro, she got a cat, let her know you care, it would mean the world to her.
Empty nest syndrome
Me all my life: why don't we get a pet?

Parents: nah

Fast-forward 25 years

Mom calls me: grab a box and put some shredded paper in it

I was confused, then I saw a receipt for cat food. 
/r/titlegore
What a stone cold bitch. 
Good lord that is a beautiful cat üòª
Brilliant mum! If I have kids, I will use a tactic like this...though there will be pets in the house already since my parents deprived me my whole childhood!

Edit: Also, a cat showed up at my mom's crib and slowly took over, becoming her first cat at 60 years old. They fell in love, and it brought my mom a lot of warmth and made her sweeter. I couldn't believe how she softened, and I loved watching the cat bring her a new joy and interest. 

It also brought my mom and I much closer.
What an adorable floof. 

OP, sorry about the loss of your soul.
They want to give you an incentive to visit them more often :)
So apparently you were a lot of work for her
When I was a kid, I wanted all sorts of pets. Cats, rabbits, ferrets, monkeys, raccoons, etc. My dad told me when I moved out and got married, my husband would get me whatever I wanted. My husband still laughs about it 20 years later. 

Edit: OP, tell your mum to wipe the cat‚Äôs eye boogers or they might stain his cute little face. :3
We had to put our cat to sleep recently and he looks exactly like him! He was the sweetest and I believe he came back in a new body to give more people all the love he has.
does this count as catfishing?
I think this is very common amongst parents. 

1) lonely. They no longer have something to watch and take care of. 

2) extra money. Why not raise a pet? Cheaper than raising a child. 

3) responsibility. Not saying you're not responsible, but most teenagers are. 

3a) I wouldn't want to raise a teenager **and** dog/cat either. 

There's other reasons, sure. But pretty sure these are influences when parents buy pets after their children move out.
My mom finally got cable TV and a gardener after I left for college
Theres a diffefence begween "I love you" and "I love you enough to have a cat with you." Sorry, OP. 
My parents did the same thing, but with cable TV and central air conditioning.
This is the cruelest thing I‚Äôve ever read. Cute cat but fuck you. 
Possibly the reason is because parents already have enough feeding and cleaning up to do? I mean pets aren't a huge burden but they're still work...especially when you have other people to take care of.

With my ex and the puppy it was like having two kids in the house. My cat now? OK she's an asshole but it's still easier than dealing with the ex and the puppy!
My friend always wanted a dog but her husband didn't want one and always refused. Then he left her for a younger woman and then he got a dog. I think the dog thing would be the final straw leading to insanity after the younger woman. LOL.
Maybe the cat was there waiting for her.
That's a cutest kitten I've seen in a while.
Them whiskers :3
They get a cat not because they like cat, it is because they miss you and want you to visit more often that is why they get a cat. 
She was waiting the perfect kitty
What kind of cat is this and how do I get one 
I'm not a cat fan . . .but this has to be the cutest cat ever
I think it‚Äôs kinda sweet. Like she did it so you‚Äôd have a reason to visit more often since you‚Äôre so far away.
"No 'moves 900km away'"

Come on mother, that's a bit of an over-reaction don't you think? :D
My gf‚Äôs cat could easily be this cuties father (https://imgur.com/gallery/sYdkl) 
She didn‚Äôt want to share.
So what kind of kitten is this for me to go beg, borrow, or steal to get one? 
900 km whats that in american
This was kind of like when I left for collage and my dad sent me a picture of a snowblower he got since he no longer had slave labor to shovel both driveways. 
Kind of like how my mom wouldn't help me pay for trade school and told me I HAD to go to college but then a couple years later sent my brother to the exact same school. Or how my mom wouldn't let my wife, then fiancee, move into our house for about 9 months or so before we were able to move out but then as soon as I move out let's my brother's girlfriend move in, and now my sister's boyfriend as well. I'm clearly not the favorite
tell mum to hide the earphones. my cat has eaten at least $500 worth of earphones in the last 5 years we have her including my precious sennheiser ones. she just can't get enough of them.
Wow that is one of prettiest cats I've ever seen.
That's your new dad now. Remember to address him as sir, and remove yourself from his lawn posthaste. 
That is almost what happened with me and my mom, except she didn't move I just went out and adopted a tuxedo cat from the shelter and of course you can imagine how mad she was at first but nomore then 2 or 3 months later she was buying the cat fancy expensive food to make sure she gets the best. Parents are weird.
I spent my whole life wanting a cat, then when I moved out and couldn't keep my cat and had her stay at my parents, my mom fell in love with her. When I visit she'll sit next to her on the couch and pet her (this from the woman who insisted she was allergic). She also periodically sends me pictures of my cat or my cat laying on my dad's chest (another person who insisted he didn't like or want pets).... well I guess she's not my cat anymore, she's my parent's now lol.

But on another note, cute cat üòª
Beautiful rag doll ! 
Your very brave with a kitten and apple wires just laying around. Cats love those. 
Ragdoll cat
What breed of cat is this? I've never seen one so angelic-looking.
That is a seriously beautiful kitten üòç
I don't even like cats and that is a beautiful cat!
My mum did that to me with a PlayStation and a trampoline. Cruel 
That's the cutest little ragdoll!
Having kids is a lot of responsibility, so is having pets. I guess parents miss having someone to care for, but it‚Äôs still stings when they wait to get a much-desired pet until the kid is no longer at home. :(
D'awww...
Your mom misses you mate. 
I love ragdolls so much
This cat is gorgeous.
Well.. obviously you have to go... to get your cat
Mom
I love animals, they are my babies since I don't have any kids. My Fiance knows that I need animals to "Mother!" I have lately been wanting another kitten. When I bring it up here rolls his eyes and says no. But the other day we were over at a friend's house and I picked up this kitten from the yard and his first ones to me after he saw my face was "Not that kitten, we will find you another one soon." So that made my day. 
Mom, FUCK YOU,  sincerely your loving son victor144p
That's longest of all long cons 
I'm not a cat person, but she is gorgeous!
I‚Äôve never been a ‚Äúcat person‚Äù but wow! I have to chime in and say that creature is simply beautiful.
Yes! My mom had a flame point ragdoll, Siamese mix and he is the sweetest thing. He‚Äôs like you said, a dog. Follows my mom everywhere, and when I was living with my mom he would try to open my door as soon as I got home to get to me. It would always freak me out, because I thought someone was literally was trying to get into my room, which I guess was true. It was just my cat. He was so good at opening doors. 
/u/FabioNovice 
I dont understand all these comments. If someone Where to wish for something over the span of multiple years, isnt it just pure evil to get it just after they move out?? 
Wow, I couldn't believe how many people in this thread have had the same experience as me. I wanted a dog all my life, but my parents wouldn't get one cause my sister is allergic. My sister didn't care, she's wanted a dog all her life as well.

Just like everyone else, my story ends the same. As soon as I moved out for college, they got a dog and expected me to come visit. I was honestly pretty spiteful about it for a long time, it stung. 
That's a shitty thing to do, if you dont mind me saying, she could have just asked to you to go see her
His eyes are so adorable 
It's a Ragdoll. It will be much more loving than any child 
Omg. This is a rag doll kitty!!! Omg they are the fluffiest and cutest babies!!! You pick them up and their body goes limp a bit hahaha I want a kitty cat now!
I thought this was /r/raisedbynarcissists  
Moral of the story: She didn't want to have a cat with you.
Now she's taking of her cat instead of taking care of yours. 
Trying to take care of two things that constantly need your attention? Hard stop! 

One thing leaves so you can get another cute thing to fill the void?? All systems a go with emphasis on the word ‚Äúvisit‚Äù!
She‚Äôs done it so you‚Äôll visit
Aren't cats with white(-ish) hair and blue eyes almost always deaf?
OP... Why did mum move 900 km away from you? I'm assuming since you asked her to get you a cat you're closer to 20 than to 40 so you probably didn't have a place of your own for a cat. Is there something we should know that your mum is privy to here? Or did she just get lonely, see a cute kitty and decide she wanted to be around the kitty?
It's a beautiful cat but I can't help but notice the gunk under its left eye...  needs wiped :)
What's a mum
Same with my dad I always wanted a dog but never got one a few months after my parents divorce he gets a dog go figure 
Beautiful eyes,what kind of breed is it?
beautiful!!!

"Hey mom, I've got no money to live on my own, I need to move back in for a bit"
Mom B8
Such a pretty baby!! 
I'm pissed at your mom for you! Look at those gorgeous eyes :)
Someone summoned a blue eyes white kitten! I've never seen such levels of cuteness!
I think you could post this in r/wtf and be okay. LOL!
Awwww!

Sweet boo boo kitty face! ‚ù§Ô∏è
almost 1 million meters away!
Oh my lord. That's over 9000 on the cuteness scale. 
Kawaii overload!!!
T_T
Lol
Look at that face. LOOK AT THAT FACE!!
*mom
üòç
She didn't want to have to take care of two babies. But she missed taking care of one.
If that‚Äôs a Ragdoll you‚Äôre going to want to move back in. 
Mum want you back.

Bribery.
What a beautiful baby she is!!
That‚Äòs the definition of perfect
Feel honored. It's a substitute for you. 
That is one cute floofage.
She timed it well ;)
Take it! 
And same thing happen with me , i my asked my parents for a puppy.
they said we don't have money for your dog, first earn then you can have it. and at last i was left with my silence , well it will be worth waiting for about 5 years or so... well, i will name him Kratos(my dog). 
Looks like she has replaced you with a cat 
It was either you or the cat.
Damn, that floofball is very cute
It was either you or the cat.
Betrayal! Go visit and collect what is rightfully yours. 
I've been begging my parents for the past 10years for one. Guess I have to wait 10 more...
Same thing happened to me. Always wanted a dog but my stepfather didn‚Äôt want to. 1 year after i moved out they got a golden retriever. 
She just misses you and wants to find an excuse to get you to come home. That or she replaced you with a cat. 
"*Don't* come visit. You've been replaced."
what kind of cat is this. i want this.too
I'd be pissed wtf.
She got the cat because she misses you. 
When my first born moved out, I replaced him with a cat. 
Parents and SO‚Äôs that deny you a cat don‚Äôt truly love you, sorry! Truth hurts.
Aww. So cute.
Thats sad
Thats a shitty move. Get TWO cats and show her whos who!
She got herself a new child, who will be running the house in a few months.
Stealing yo mothers karma, smh.
This cat looks exactly like a Furby.
THIS CAT IS SO GORGEOUS. AAAAAAAAAAAAAA. I would really visit and STAY LOL.
omg-a ragdoll-sqeeee!  OP-go visit that ball of pure baby softness.
SO PURE. SO SOFT. SO FLUFFY. 
What a gorgeous kitty!
THOSE EYES OMG
My parents were so mad when I adopted this sweet old fluffy calico without asking them.  Like a month or two later after she had gotten acclimated I came home one night and my dad's sleeping on the couch with her on his chest petting her in his sleep.  Keep saying you hate pets dad! [Here she is.](https://i.imgur.com/HRrKL4C.jpg) (E: Before anyone says anything, that's our basement and right before I had to put her down.  She had a great last year, our house isn't actually that gross looking and she didn't always look that bad.  E2: [Here's](https://i.imgur.com/4PGqatb.jpg) my other cat watching over her the day before I had to take her in.  The blankets are me sleeping on the floor with her that night)

Your mom's is beautiful BTW.
Those eyes are the sky at night, and the ocean and energy healing gems.
Picture of animal + sappy backstory. To the front page! 
Let's face it, OP. You've been replaced with a younger, fluffier model.
I believe you misspelled mom.
That's your substitute
Mom is Savage 
That‚Äôs the most beautiful cat on earth.
Same thing happened to me but with a foosball table 
oh fuck im dead
Haha.  Your mom replaced you with a cat.  /Dickpunch
Your mum literally cat fished you
Are you fucking kidding me OP's Mom?
My parents did this. Basically replaced my brother and I with two dogs after we moved away to college...
Damn where do people find such pretty kitties
Wow, thats one big slap in the face for you haha. 
What kind of kitty is this? Because I need one stat
My mom said no for 20 years. I move out and now I have 3 cats. The twist here is she loves them so much. She got her own cat...
That‚Äôs bribery! But so freaking cute.. smart mom you have there
Maybe your mum actually missing you so bad 
She played the long game 
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move.
That's a cute ragdoll kitten
Superb 
I have those same pillow cases üòÉ 
Also, that cat is god damn adorable :)
What a hater 
Mom is lonely
i'd never talk to my mum again
The perfect scheme to get you to visit her enough
This could also go on r/mildlyinfuriating
We also have a ragdoll. They are just as cute when they are grown up.
omg so kawaii
Your mom misses you, I guarantee it.
That‚Äôs is one cute cat! But does not look like a mom that have a 25+ kids bedroom.
It's your substitute! Or maybe she thought you'd need an incentive to come back and visit...? Either way, it's adorable üòç
Okay that thing is beautiful 
Vicious ploy. Genius Mum

My supervisor at my last job was a Green Beret. Guy did some crazy shit. I went over to his house for a BBQ and he had a cat that looked like this one lol. Always cracked me up when a 6‚Äô 4 ‚Äú green  beret had this fluffy cat that he adored. 
OP has been replaced by a cat. That's what's going on. Empty nest syndrome.
Well played! 
She did it so you would come visit, because she knows you love cats!
A blue point Himalayan! Those are so nice and furry! 
That looks like a Ragdoll to me, and if it is, prepare for that cat to get ***HUGE***.
Beautiful!!
Thoughts & prayers.
Ragdoll? Looks just like mine :)
Most parents get a pet when the children move out to fill the void. 
She did this because she misses you.
She wants you to move 900 km closer
Lol my mom did that to my brother. He‚Äôd always begged for a cat and she always said no, but as soon as he moved out we got a kitten lmao
Does he have extra thumbs? 
Cuz if so maybe my kitty had your mom's kitty.

That's fucked up. But then again. She did it so you'd go visit lol. 
I guess you were her pet for the first 20 years. 
CUTE
*swoon*
Man, I remember all my life wanting a cat all through the years I was a kid and finally in my teenage years for some reason, we got a cat. I was so thrilled that first month of having a cat, I could hardly believe we finally had a cat roaming around our house.

A few months later it was, "Hey stupid, get over here!" And stupid happily came if I had food in my hand, or sometimes just for a good head scratch. I loved stupid. I miss her sometimes.
Those eyes are gorgeous.
What kind of cat is this???
I initially read car instead of cat. I was  confused.
Frankly. That cat is adorable.

I have those pillowcases
Like my mom. She always lived with animals in my grandmother's house. Dogs, Cats, Birds.   
But she was always like distant with the cats, she did not hate them or fear them, but she simply was distant to animals.   
Through the years we had a dog, and my mother love him but was not as intense with what happened next.   
Years after being without pets, a friend gave me a kitty she found, my mother was the only that was a little reserve to have pets again, but it was love at first sight.    
Since my mother was the only one staying home almost all day, she connected really fast with the kitty, and that was the beginning.    
Sadly that Cat died in 2015. But now we have 4 cats. We even move to another country and we traveled with our 4 cats. And my mother is now the most intense lovingcats person.   
When people gets old they can change I think. Or maybe, they can start doing the things they always wanted to do. 
edit: Typo
Are you feline homesick?
Diabolical.
TIL, OP was their mother's cat for 20 years.
Feelsbadman
Actually super shitty.
This is my fianc√©'s mom. Except when we ask how the kitten is doing a few weeks later she says, "Oh that thing? I gave it back." Rinse and repeat every few months. 
That is her replacement for you :) The new you is adorable.
Mum knows how to take good picture üíï
Your mom didn't want to have to take care of your cat and you at the same time.  Now that she's not taking care of you, she's much more willing to take care of her own cat.
[mfw I click to zoom](https://i.imgur.com/jV1CLdH.png)
why your mom moved 900km away from you, do you miss her? 
It has beautiful eyes. Also are those brown eye poop or something
Ragdoll living in a movie!!! 
Katter or kitter? 
S/He's Beautiful!

Siamese are the best. We have two.
My girlfriend was gonna get me a corgi as a surprise, asks my parents if its okay if I could have a dog. Dad says no, so her family gets the dog. Ever since hes seen her, my dad is in love with her. It sucks to not have your pet
Plot twist.  Mom doesn't really have a cat she just wants u to come visit.
Savage
Me growing up: can we get a dog?

Parents: no

Me, moves out

Parents: we got a dog, and a huge T.v.!
That cat is more beautiful than I'll ever be.
that's one cute cat.
Perfect time to get your own cat :)
"mum you gotta be kitten me..."
Mum, can we get a cat?

- no, cuz I want a cat. I don't want that cat to think they belong to you. Mine. My cat. Not yours. 
Maybe it's a present
If I ever would have cats these kind of cats I would take. 
That eye boogie is driving me nuts !
Maaaaaan that‚Äôs some baby back bulllllllshit
She had this planned all along. Sucker.
That is cold calculation right there. I admire and fear your mother.
I‚Äôd find a better place to keep those headphones. 
‚ÄúMum‚Äù

Found the Brit 
But can you throw a 90kg object 900km?
Harro is me you new father
When my kids were young they wanted a dog. I said no. I dont need another mouth to feed or take care of. Now they are grown and almost all 4 are out if the house. We now have dogs. 
Real truth: Mom is scared that you'll never visit her so she gets a kitten to entice you to come and visit her. Moms love their kids. 
She had no need for a pet when you were there. Don't you understand parent hood yet?
She just didn't want to share the cat with you.
what kind of kitty is that?
Same thing happened in my family. When my mom moved to live with her husband they adopted a cat.
Haven‚Äôt read all the comments but from the picture it looks like a Ragdoll. The wife and I have 2 of them and we love them to death. 
Top 10 anime betrayals
Well that is the cutest cat EVER OMG 
Betrayal has never looked so cute and fluffy.
That's so rude.
It looks less like a cat and more like a Pokemon 
Is that a ragdoll? My cat pretzel looks just like him
I LOVE BIRMANS!
Savage mom, confirmed.
Is it a Ragdoll or Sacred Birman?
Not gonna lie. Your mum is kind of an ass. 
That's kinda messed up unless there was a solid reason as to why y'all couldnt. 
Doesn‚Äôt trust you around cats. 
Cats are shit
Thats fucked up.
that cat is perfect lol. It‚Äôs prob to get you to visit 
IDK, my family has a Himalayan and she is the worst cat ever. Incredibly picky eater, unpredictable, and moody. She will walk over for attention, start purring as you pet her, then decide she's tired of it and claw you with no warning. 
Plot twist is she just sent you a photo of a cat but you only find out when you get there. 
What breed of cat is this?
That's mean of your mom.
So cute

Oh my gosh I just want to hug that cat! 
Awww yay
Lmao your mum knew you wanted this 

Got played hardcore son r/raisedbynarcissists 
I would be booking my ticket so fast
My wife kind of had the reverse of this.  When i got a new job that required us to move several hundred miles away from her parents she wanted to bring her parents' dog with us. 
My wife loved this dog and was really close with her.  Her mom was like no way! 
This is our baby! We move, get another dog, then 2 years later her parents are like, so we really don't have time for the dog and we want her to have a good home.  Do you want her?
Isn‚Äôt 900km like a couple of miles?
Awwwwwwww üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
I don‚Äôt think she really wants you to come. üòú
Classic Mum.

But seriously, you have to visit this cutie!
It's a trap!
My child left home and I want them to come back... They always wanted a cat... I've got the purrfect plan.
So cute 
God I hate mum. 
So cute!
adorbs
buys cat as lure to bring daughter home, keeps cat because floofy and soft and cute and cat is friend
Wow.. what beautiful eyes.. I've downloaded a copy of the photo.. thank you
This might be the cutest cat picture of all time 
This is the real inception.
Mom understands the power of incentives.
When my sister went to college, my parents got two cats. When I went to college, they got a dog. When my brother went to college, they got another dog.
Punish her by never seeing her again. Oh, and steal the cat. 
You should send her a picture of the retirement home you plan to put her in. 
Looks like a Himalayan.  I used to have one.  Was an absolutely amazing cat.  Very mellow.  Your Mom will definitely enjoy the new You 2.0.  
[deleted]
What a great little cat! \^_\^
r/titlegore
Mum had enough to look after... Seriously do you have any friends with kids? Fucking nightmare just getting them out for a beer.
Jesus Christ that cat is beautiful. I can't show this to my cats on fear of jelouscy.
Legitimately classic mom move üòÇ
Um, holy shit.
Catnap it
Once my mother came to terms with the fact that she would not be a grandmother, she went out and got 2 dogs. All through nmy childhood she had excuses why we couldn't get a dog.
For the last 20 years, YOU were her cat!
What kind of cat is this?
Do you know the circumstance upon which she moved ? 
Absolutely beautiful little fluff ball. I lost my childhood kitty of 17 years this past fall, and your mum's new companion is the spitting image of how mine was at that age. Blue Points are so pretty. My little princess was actually a stray who was abandoned by her family, but serendipity brought her to wander into my family's backyard. I saw those big blue eyes and fell in love. 


Thank you for posting this, I miss her terribly, and seeing a little fluffy look alike makes me smile. :)
You were the cat.
All childhood I wanted a swimming pool.  The had one put in after I moved out.  
[deleted]
Smart mom knows how to get you to visit.
How far is that?!
The fuck is wrong with your mom?
That's an awesome cat
She misses you.
In cat culture that‚Äôs not considered a dick move
Those eyes're so blue!
What‚Äôs the cat‚Äôs name? Betrayal?
https://imgur.com/lBBF6Ma
Anyone know what breed of cat that is? I see them all over the internet and they‚Äôre my favorite! But I can‚Äôt figure out what breed they are 
Why did mum leave?
/r/raisedbynarcissists 
At least you got replaced with pets, I got replaced with a riding lawn mower and I am allergic to grass.
That is one of the most beautiful and cutest kittens I have ever seen! I need one
Life is short, enjoy your time together while you can. It sucks being so far from family and friends you love who you'll see only a few times on special occasions and then never ever again. 
Your replacement is very cute.
My dad was broken hearted after our dog died and said ‚Äúno more dogs ever‚Äù. My parents are from South America and believed dogs should be outside dogs. Now that I left home and my sister is in college they have 3 inside dogs. He‚Äôs crazy about them and he spoils them rotten, specially a chihuahua mix that is crazy about him too. Last week he sent me a slide show he had done about her, 3 minutes long and set to Aretha Franklin‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre The Best Thing That Ever Happened To Me‚Äù. I‚Äôm 100% serious 
That's what loneliness does. Pay her a visit and bring it with you when you leave ;)
After playing monster hunter world last night, all I can think about is "I want that as my palico".
Parents definitely do this because now they are no longer looking after you and they feel like there is a void so don‚Äôt take it personally negatively actually take it personally in a positive way- They miss you and now they‚Äôve got someone who will coax you into visiting

That is the most beautiful little kitten
Damn, that's one hell of a cute cat
aww, look at those eyes.
It's so cute!! Omg!!! But your mom still sucks for doing that to you!! You should go there and just take the kitty home with you. 
Its either you or the cat.
Really, Mom?

I mean, you can't be angry at that little face, but still....

Time to get a cat.
FYI that's 560 freedom units for those of us stateside.
What breed of cat is this?
Moral of the story: it wasn‚Äôt cats that she didn‚Äôt love...
/r/DisneyEyes
Those eyes are magical
got that lil eye boogy though.
She replaced you with the thing you wanted most. Sorry.
I think that's because they fear you not visiting them.

My parents did exactly the same for this reason.

I mean, we once had a cat for like 5 months, but it then ran away (rip Einstein), but they never let me had one again, except for the 2 rabbits my granddad later ate.
This Thread angers me
Manipulation 
Guess you have to move back in. 
Wewere the only people in a giant neighborhood without a dog or some kind of pet. When i moved out i got a dog and now my parents beg for my dog to come visit eveybweekend...
It‚Äôs a lovely cat tho. 
Its just a beacon so you go visit
OP you should visit your mom a bit more. Don't forget to bring a camera.
Fucked up 
Floofiest cat I've ever seen
That‚Äôs a Birman. Love Birmans, most affectionate cats I know.
Visit her and steal the cat. Its fair.
Can I have your moms fucking cat
Ask two random strangers to pose with you in a picture. 
Send it to her; "sure, mom&pop can come too, right?"
