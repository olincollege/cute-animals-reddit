These were made by Becca Golins (dragonsandbeasties) from polymer clay.  She makes adorable dragon art!

Edit: typo on shop name
How are these so perfect???
I... Can't eat this.
Hey, it’s really uncool to post this without referencing the artist. The maker is @dragonsandbeasties on IG, they make polymer clay crafts, and they work really hard to make their creations. You need to credit them if you repost their work. 
As someone who was lucky enough to be able to purchase one of these clay dragons, please credit the artist. She is amazing and does this for a living.

Nice move stealing from an Instagram artist and not giving her the credit.
These are made out of polymer clay and are made by Becca Golins, aka dragonsandbeasties on Instagram. 
I don't know how but I **will** replicate these in edible form. Experiments start sometime next week. If I'm successfull there will be pictures.
Link the actual artist, dipshit
Looks like a Pokémon 
Yeah, but how does it *taste?*

Oh what I thought they were clay!

This was my total mistake in not crediting the artist straight away, I posted this just before I had to go out and i'm just getting back to it now. My apologises again as I know getting attention in the art world is hard enough and to not be credited is a real pain, you can find Becca Golins incredible work here [https://dragonsandbeasties.com/](https://dragonsandbeasties.com/) feel free to show her some love!

I thought Pokemon at first. Good job nonetheless.
I am supposed to want to EAT a croissant, not ADOPT it.
I would pay to have these built outta clay as like, paper weights or something. 
I thought that was a pokemon at first glance.
Those look so dope!
Drakes*
What the fuck.. is this actually cute food? I've never thought of food cute before that's a weird revelation to have stoned out my mind 
They're clay? Oooh, that explains a lot. My boyfriend actually posted this picture on a group chat last night, and I told him I'd make some for him, then spent twenty minutes online trying to find a smooth croissant recipe lmao
Nice even if I do not looking forward to eat it
And that'd how I never ate the cute croissant and it sadly rot :(
i want to eat those but would probably fell bad after 
Ummm I'll take 1000

I've been staring at this for a good few minutes now. This is truly magnificent. Look how intricate the detailing is. Pardon my ignorance but is this actually edible? 
My fat ass thought these were actually food 
r/forbiddensnacks 
This shit look scary. It's like a live Pokemon. No I'm not eating that
I just involuntarily shouted "Cute!" while walking through a parking lot in the middle of the day because this was the top post when I checked Reddit.

I know at least two people heard me and one turned to stare for a second... Whatever, I stand by my gut reaction. These are too cute. 
Well now they are too cute to eat. .. 
You really don't want to screw around with these and treat them like pets, if you're going to get one, make sure you do your research to know what you're getting into.
I didn't know I could not want to eat a croissant until right now. They are truly too cute to eat! 
Imagine actually eating one of those. I don’t think I could do it.
I need to see the expectation vs reality pictures of these lol they’re so cute!!
Looks beautiful taste like shit 🤔
Oh shit! I woke one up!
I was ready for these to be croissantasorous rexes. But croissant dragons are just as awesome!!
How were these even made?? This is so cute! Too cute to even eat.. that makes me sad.. 
Those eyes though... what are they made of?
do you know how time consuming making normal croissants are but dragon crossisants wow how does one make!!

They look like a Gen 8 Pokémon (kinda Rock/Dragon)

And I love it
Am I the only one that kinda dislikes food with such intricate designs? Like, that looks way too good to just eat. I wanna put that in a display case.

Looks like a momma showing off her babies!
It kind of looks like those dragons from Kirby's Return to Dream Land.
Anyone know how to make these without the dough spreading too much leaving them unrecognizable?
They look like real dough. Well done!
Hey I need u to make me some ship to me ask for my address on private msg

Can't wait for my mom to see these on Pinterest then cry when they come out looking like deformed demon spawn. 
Even though they’re clay, they look more like crescent rolls than croissants.  
She can come to my house for tea anytime
Woah!!!! So Impressive!

I was about to say. No way is that made of real bread. Still really great art though
How is one supposed to eat these without feeling like a monster?
Those aren't croissants. They don't have many layers of pastry. 
Reminds me old series called pocket dragons, super cute and neat sculptures.
These are awesome!!!!!

That's no pastry 🤔... 
I-IM SORRY *crunch*

I cannot eat these, it would be considered cannibalism. 
Pikachu would be proud.
its so cute i cant even eat it.
I have a hard enough time rolling a croissant the right way, let alone in the style of a dragon. 
So damn cute ❤️
I actually need to make these 😍
How could someone eat that? 
Cool so you just have to bake the one, and then it can bake the rest?
Must have!
Ohhh I thought they were edible croissants. Sad but I guess they would be hard to eat.

I wouldn't eat those, I'd feel so bad afterwards.

Too cute to eat.
i would struggle to eat this because it would make me feel like im eating lizard meat
Crescent rolls, NOT croissant
I love when people flip out when someone doesn't "credit the artist" as if this isn't Reddit and a place for just posting random ass pictures. Like, if I see something cool and feel like posting it I do EXACTLY that...I don't really give a damn about trying to find who made the picture then give them a whole bibliography. I'm just trying to post cool shit I find, nothing more nothing less.

Also it seems that the only people that call OP's out on not giving credit is when said people know who the artist is. other wise no one ever gives a shit. I've never seen some random person just say "where's creative credit OP???"...it's always "The artist is blahblah WHERE'S CREDIT OP?!?!"...yeah like since you have the upper hand you try to act better-than but the moment you don't know the artist you don't say shit about credit.

Anyways, sorry for the rant, I just don't get why people act like they care so much.
