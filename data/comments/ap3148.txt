Three girls die and go to heaven...


...they are greeted by st. Peter at the pearly gates. He welcomes them and then says "But be careful, there are lots of ducks in heaven. If you step on any you will be punished". The girls go in and the first one steps on a duck right away and the ugliest man in existence gets chained to her for eternity. The second girl steps on a duck after about a week and the second ugliest man is chained to her for eternity. The third girl, however, never steps on a duck and the most beautiful man she had ever seen was chained to her. "What did I do to deserve such a nice thing?" she asks God. God looks at her and says, "He stepped on a duck

Not to be weird but like, wouldn‚Äôt he flap his wings to try and prevent falling? Is something wrong with his wings?
Just give him a cuddle that's all he wants.

You Died
This is it. This video is the cutest thing that has ever existed.
You do not want a duck as a pet. Two friends of mine got two ducks as pets for their frat house. They are really cute when small but when they get bigger they have monster shits that require a lot of attention if you keep them indoors. Constant changing of the floor material. If you‚Äôve had birds before then you‚Äôd probably be okay but not a pet for novice pet owners.
It's all "aww" and cute until you feed that little fucker, then it starts to shit like Rambo's guns and you start to questioning yourself and your life choices.  

Source: I had a pet duck in a house with a small garden. Poor bastars flew over the fence and the neighbours ate it, top 3 saddest death of one of my pets.
In the uk we call baby ducks ‚Äòducklings‚Äô. Weird, I know.
This is the type of stuff that keeps me going 
Another one for r/mallardlyinteresting

So it‚Äôs not a baby duck, but still ridiculously adorable, these are what is called a ‚Äúcall duck‚Äù they were bred to be small so they were easier to take hunting. They were used to call in wild ducks before the prohibition of live bait/live calls for waterfowl hunting. I raise ducks and use them for their eggs, they are all derps their entire lives.
