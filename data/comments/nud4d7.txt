This is why i can't foster animals. I'd just end up with a ton of new pets.
It works. I want to adopt her. I can't, but I want to.
Whereabouts are you located OP? If you’re within a few days driving distance, I’ll adopt her :)
I would IMMEDIATELY adopt. Purrfect pictures. :)
For everyone who has asked, this is Feye’s foster buddy, Soy Milk. She’s two weeks younger and I would love for them to be adopted as a pair: https://imgur.com/gallery/Q3KxNyA
These look like Calvin, trying to get his face stuck that way.

Edit: Found it! https://www.reddit.com/r/calvinandhobbes/comments/263xl2/one\_of\_these\_days\_your\_face\_is\_going\_to\_freeze/
Cutest cat ever. After my George-Pudding of course. Prrrrt to you too, cutie.
I’d be a foster fail with that lil cutie❣️
He derp. He screm. He blep.
they told you 'Take a picture - Show my *PeRsoNaLiTy'*

am just a little kitten, but am Sweet as i can be ^:}

So now i gonna 'sell myself'! The faces that I do

are Sure to tug at heartstrings, saying '*Take me Home with You!'*

the first one - kinda *snarky*, that's my face - alittle 'doubt'...

n then i did a couple where my tongue is hanging out 

n that's me, being *Really* LOUD - am do my Big *MEOOOOW!!!*

am Crying for a Human friend

to Please COME PICK ME *NOW!!*

❤️
Beautiful! Furrever home guaranteed!
The sass is strong in this one. I'd adopt her! (If I didn't live on other side of the Big Pond, and didn't have two demons of my own.)
Perfectly captured! I hope a furrever home is not far behind :)
That fist one would have me adopting in a heart beat.
I don't know how people foster animals.  I would never be able to take an animal in, bond with it and then let someone else take them.
I love the bottom right one!  
Perfectly captured!
I’m getting strong Calvin (from Calvin and Hobbes) vibes.
Got the ear tufts of a Maine Coon.
This is the cutest little bean ever!! I want to adopt her!
So. After you send these pictures it turned into a foster fail?
Angry, hungry, tired, and blep ! Best personality !
I’m not even a cat person and I want that kitten
10/10 would adopt.
That lil raspberry 😍
Counter clockwise starting with the top right:  
  
1. Feisty  
2. Sassy  
3. Scary  
4. BLEP  
  
Thats one cute kitten.
1) Winks ohai. 2)More noms plz 3)You’rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre heeeeeeeere, there’s nothing I fear! 4) phbbbbbbbt
10/10 I want this kitty
This has the same energy as the Calvin and Hobbes strip where Calvin turns himself into a tiger and I love it.
If he's in NY state I'll take him today. He looks just like my Tommy Boy I had when I was younger. Been looking for another since. He was my best friend.
Yeah, I couldn’t imagine fostering. I’d just end up with a million cats.
Those are purrfect!
That's a birthday card if I've ever seen one.
You could have a high speed blur with "speed demon" as the description and I'd adopt her. 😂
Little onlooker
😻❤️😂I hope he gets adopted with Soy Milk as his buddy🙏, Too dang cute 🥰
What purrfect tinder pictures
Roaring kitty! Deep fucking value. GAMESTOP TO THE MOON!
I vote bottom right.

How much do you want for that cat?
Damn it. Tell  me where to pick her up
Love the little tiny ear tuffs. Is this a maine coon kitten?
Looks like a Maine Coons, beatimus
Only need the upper left photo.
Had I been the foster, Ida taken the pictures... looked at them... called the shelter, and told them to forget posting the pics, I had found my next kitty.
I've fostered dozens in my life, and I *swear* this one would *never* get out of my house!  I *know* her:  she's the re-incarnation of a certain female who came to my place to have her kittens and then ran my life like a drill sergeant for the next 20 years!
The top right and bottom left seal the deal.
Is anyone else seeing Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes?
I currently live with four foster failure.
I wish to pet the floof!
Sold!!!!
I could never give up something so sweet.  I'd never make it as a foster mom to animals.
I’ll start the bidding at 1 million dollars.
Enjoying the foster fail? Or just not admitted it to yourself yet? 🤣 SO CUTE!!
12/10 would adopt if I wasn’t allergic.
That perfect little face.

Also, thank you for your service fostering. I do rescue and foster and it’s not easy.
That bottom right one is just perfect!
10/10 would adopt
It's funny to think that these happened in sequence
The top left and bottom right seal the deal.
She perfect.  I love her.
THE LAST ONE IS GOLDEN
That's enough personality of a litter.
Omg... Would be mine in a heartbeat!
Awww I want this sweet beautiful kitty!!
From the first picture I will adopt! I’m in New Zealand!
HOW?!?!!!?! My cats look at the camera for 0.00001sec and then look away. I can never get them to look. EVER. Let alone all the crazy things you managed to do.
If I didn't already have five cats... 😿
I want this cat immediately, right now.
Gimme!
#😘
The blep has destroyed me!.. *typed from grave*
Tongue out. Enough said.
Sold! I'll take a half dozen.
I want it. Omg.
Reminds me of that scene in Friends when Joey is showing the different expressions/moods he can portray to catch a directors eye lol
Angry. Hungry. Yelley. Blep.
I want her and I don't even want a cat
The final pic seals the deal. Pfpfpfhfhfhttt.
I feel like I’ve seen these faces on “School photo day” in Calvin and Hobbes comic strip
Wow amazing mlems. That's a 14/10 cat if I've ever seen one. I'll take 7 even though my wife is allergic she'll just have to make due
will definitely adopt!!!
I’ll take all 4 thank you 😊
Captions: Hmm, OM-NOM-NOM, HEEEEY!, Pthfffft!
The bottom left looks like the cover of the Deftones' (Like) Linus EP
She looks adorable!
I would adopt her
And I bet adoption offers flooded in!!
You're a stronger person than I am, that personality?  That is a guaranteed foster fail.  I'd have to keep that rascal hooligan of a kitty - he would make life fun on the daily.
Awww, reminds me of [this great comic ](http://www.teachmeteamwork.com/.a/6a00d83451bd8169e201543606b591970c-pi) from Bill Waterson.
I’ll take her 🥺
Damn!  Too cute!
That last blep one
[deleted]
SO FRICKEN CUTE OMFG
Yup!  That will do it!!  She’s adorable.
Top left picture REALLY reminds me of a Calvin and Hobbes expression
Perfect
12/10 would adopt!
😉 😜

😆 😛
I would die for this cat
You fostering animals is extremely commendable. I used to work at the SPCA and fosters were worth their weight in gold. Many became foster failures which I would certainly become so no shame just the reality. 

I appreciate you greatly and so do the animals. Keep fighting the good fight and take care of your mentals so you can be a savior for as long as possible. 

Plus these photos are 😍

Mad love and respect ✊
I fell in love with my rescue because he was the kitten that walked all over his siblings. Ate like a slob. And was desperate for attention. I’ve had him for years and he’s the same and I love it.
That looks like a baby Maine coon! I’m sure she’ll get adopted ASAP!
I would adopt in a heartbeat
The last one is the one! It is hilarious!
*ding* “Email sent”

*ding, ding, d-d-d-d-ding* “You’ve got mail”
I am literally on the other side of the planet from you and I. WANT. THAT. CAT.

If that photo montage doesn't get people clamouring for an opportunity to meet her and give her a forever home, I don't know what will.
Omgggggggggg
I am not in the market for a cat, but please send me that one ASAP
It’s the ear tufts for me
I would name it Kenickie.
I’ll take 5 please
Bratty, Sassy, Tired, DeRp
😍Looks a lot like my furr-kid when he was younger. I’d adopt this wee one in a heartbeat! 💓
Suspicious/Hungry/Jubilant/Derp?
[Does my cat have an illegitimate child!?](https://i.imgur.com/9sdpCrI.jpg)
I kind of fostered a cat from a friend as their dog attacked him,7 years later he still doesn't like anyone but me .they never asked for him back so he's my child now <3
Hé reminds me of Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes
I'd love to foster but I couldn't give any up, which would make me the crazy cat lady.
omg the cute lil tongue
Funniest part is the background didn’t change and her position barely did too. This was all in the span of a few seconds at most
I Tale your entire stock...if I had money

Cute Kitten
Each photo is so adorable, I want to squeeze her and shower her with kisses.
Ffs keep this crazy kitty
Mmmmmhmmm I'll take her!!!
That blep in the 4th picture did me in :)
It’s def getting adopted lol.
I’d love to look after this dude.
Hahahhaa adorable
LOOK AT HIS LITTLE TOUNGE OMFG
Annoyed, hungry, sleepy, blep! Those are pretty much my four stages of daily work at my job.
In the first one, her face reminds me of Scar from The Lion King.
I'm digging that stank eye picture. She seems like a sassafras.
I sneeze. I eat. I sleep. I derp. Pick me!
Was supposed to look after cat for brother in law whilst he was moving house. Five years we’ve had her now... oops
Good job!  I’m allergic to most cats and I want to adopt her!!  Thanks for being an awesome human
I love that 4th one with the tongue. 😸
That last picture definitely seals the deal
That first one looks like Calvin's school picture.
Along with the other 1.3 thousand commenters you have made me want to adopt this cat.
You see this is what I just don’t like about cats, some of them possess an innate ability to just force me to fall in love with them via cute faces. Only problematic because boom before you can count to three, )okay maybe longer than that) im sitting in a house with nineteen and a half cats with a full body sleeve of scratch marks
snarky, hungry, demonic and blep
First he mlem, then he screm
I'll take her, where are you located??
If these pics don't get him/her adopted nothing will! ❤️🥰
JUDGE - YOU ARE GUILTY OF BEING A FOSTER FAILURE , HERE'S YOUR KITTENS
Awe!!! Make her a flower crown! Those are so perfect and make animals look like fairy princesses.
1 & 4 are the best \^\^
Super cute
WORTHY!!!!
11/10 would adopt
Holy moly… where is she and when can I pick her up? Such a little cutie! 🥰
That first pic.. I m already sold 🥰
OMG these are adorable ♥♥♥♥ (especially the tongue)!
So adorable, if he was around my area I would snatch the little guy up!
I would adopt at the first picture alone
Reminds me of Bill the cat from Bloom County comics
10/10 would adopt immediately if my apartment building allowed animals
Omg, I would have to keep her!! What a cutie 🥰
Give pls
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Adorable little floof! I want!!
I’m in love 😻
Instant application submission
Personalikitty
Nailed it. 10/10. Would be chosen by this kitty.
I love her 🥰
This is perfect. People going to be fighting over her
If that cat wasn't so purty it would be a character actor.
Angry, hungry, sleepy, bleb.

My soulmate!
What a character!
Fair enough
Sweeeeet!  
One of my kitties randomly does “the sneer”, no idea why, and I love her to bits.
That smol blep had me sold instantly!
gib to me nao
SOLD!
"Hey doll" winks.
"If you could feed me early it'd really help meowt"
"Ha!"
"Where'd she go"
Please name her Calvin after Calvin and Hobbes. These look exactly like his school picture day photos
I will take two
Hitting that adoption button with light speed!
The stink eye ahahaha omg
If she wasn't adopted in half a second I'd be amazed.  The tufts on those ears are adorable.
I love them! So cute!!!
If my guardian wasn't allergenic to cats I would adopt her in a second <3
I would adopt her in a heartbeat
So precious!
Hi I would like one cat pls

Gib me
10/10 would adopt
Calvin?
Absolute confusion, drunken yelling, belligerent screaming and blep
Blep and mlem. So cute!
I love her
oh she’s beautiful!! i hope she finds her forever home soon!! great photos, especially bottom right :D
I'm definitely bottom left right now.
Sooo darn adorable 🥰 you did great!
r/animalsbeingderps
Has there been calls to adopt her?? 🥰👍
I got a Calvin and Hobbes feel! Too cool!
Come to #catecoin @cateclub : 🐈😍
xtremehigh.com
Omg what a goofy kitten! I want!
I took in a stray that ended up bring pregnant. Now I got this monster https://imgur.com/a/OHhj8FX and two others I’m trying to find homes. No one wants cats and I can’t keep four cats in my apartment forever :(
I'll take two!
So... was she adopted in the appropriate time of about 0.00005 seconds after uploading those photos?!?!
The last one is the cutest thing ever!

&#x200B;

I'm in love
Those ears, that tongue. So cute
Excuse me, this is a Flerkin
You are brilliant ♥️!
This is not a kitten. This is a legend in the making.
Adorable
Adorable
I’ll adopt too
her name is pywacket. no questions.
Hope they get adopted together. Honestly her expressions read like a mood board for me, pretty sure top left is my face daily
mmm mimosooo!!😍
blep
How does she know my exact morning moods?
Adorable
haha my cat does the exact same thing aswell. So cute!!
Awwww, she's adorable!  I'd adopt her in a heartbeat.  What a cutie!
This will be one loud mouth, long rear legged, huge yawning, dog'ish kitty!  
Could be a great little friend, someone's gonna be lucky.
First pic is Kitties With Attitude.
what a little cutie
The first photo worked for me. I unfortunately already have two cats, and my HOA only allows two pets (same goes for apartments). But I’m sure this little cutie will get adopted quickly.
Just moved out of a place that charged me 25 USD per cat per month (50 if not rescue). Got second cat a few weeks before moving out and never bothered to tell them. Thankfully both kitties were/are super well behaved (apart from new guy loving to take food off the counter on occasion so they'll never know.
I'd adopt for the blep if I had space
Angry, hungry, sleepy and derpy.
The restraint you have of not catnapping this one and keeping them forever anyway is really respectable.
**ILL TAKE YOAR ENTIRE STOCK**
I would adopt in a heart beat!!
I'm interested
That'll do it.
Oh adopted without a second thought. She's so gorgeous!
Would adopt. And I’m not even a cat person.
I want her!!
GIMME THE CAT
1 and 4 have me in stitches. What a personality
I would adopt her. My cat would hate me for years but I would based on these pictures. 

Good job OP.
I love the first pic
She's a charmer.
I’ll take her.
Reminds me of a cat version of Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes
Bottom left pic looks like she was just told a really funny joke. Or she saw someone fall.
If that bottom right one doesn't get her adopted then nothing will!
I’ll take two - they’re small
sending bleps has a 99% success rate!
I don't know which of these photos I love more... but bottom right omg lol
I want more of this cat in my life.
She is PRESH.
Omg these are adorable. And that lil stank face at the top 😆🥰😍
Omg this cat is sooooo cute
10/10 would adopt
The bottom right picture floored me!
Mission accomplished ❤❤❤❤
It's the mlem tongue for me
We demand an adoption update
You don’t happen to be in Colorado do you?
Adorable
BLEP lol
That last one tho 🥰
SOLD! I’ll take all four, please.
What an absolute darling
Adorable
I'm Angry, I'm Happy, I'm Fierce, I'm Derp
I would adopt instantly
Blep!
The first one already sold me.
FUS RO DAH
I think he looks at the food, as if someone wants to feed it, and at the same time he feels sleepy.  
Eat, my little one, then sleep.
😂♥️♥️♥️
Sold
I'll take her!
Who wouldn't adopt at this point?
I’ll take em
Grumpy derp is highly adoptable.
Top left pic looks like the kitten is giving the “U wot m8” face
Cuteeee
She is beautiful and adorable and just perfect. I am in love 😍
Gimme
If I didn’t already have three cats I would adopt another...
Soooi we took about ten different photos in the span of five minutes and say “these are the ones that capture her personality”?

Downvote me all you want. You know I’m not wrong.
Hello my fellow cat fosterer
Name: Derpasmooch.
I FEEL the vibe of number 4
That makes me want to adopt her so bad
The bottom two are the best
scute
gave my only free award
One please!
Number 4 FTW!!
Her expressions remind me of that one guy’s mom who wants pumpkin pie haha. She’s so cute. I would totally adopt her!
Where is she? I want her.
The last one lol
10/10 would adopt.
Where do i sign ?
This is the cutest I have seen all day
In Houston, if not picked up by this weekend will drive up to adopt!
We (married couple no kids) have adopted prior and have a solid record, we’re looking for a new kitty :)
I’ll have her and I HATE cats
The little tongue sticking out at the end…mine does that too. So cute!
Adorable!!!
I'm not a cat person, but these pics are making me reconsider that stance.
Angy, hungy, slep, blep
Just... just shut up and take my adoption application okay?
Blep.
How do I adopt?
I'll take em. Right now
Between that face and those ear tufts, I’m sold.  Where are you located?
Fricken cutie
Personality: Confused, goofy and tired
If she isn’t adopted yet. I’m in north Austin
where is the cat located? I would love to adopt!
For all the people in this thread... if you haven't seen it yet, please watch Ana Akanas video on YouTube titled "I have 6 cats"

https://youtu.be/b-ELMKkHEDU

It's an ear worm... once you hear it, you'll never unhear it.  Lol.  Enjoy!
It’s like a Calvin & Hobbes strip.
Cat version of Calvin
I want her.
Awwwwwww little one
Okay! She can have my bed 😻
Rock and Roll r/IllegallySmolCats.

Whadda you lookin' at?
If I hadn’t just adopted two I’d take her. Cute!
Wow, is your kitten my cat? Look at my first two posts. They both have an M on their forehead!
Done. Where do I sign up?
I would adopt immediately!
I’ll take her. She’s me in kitten form.
I just found a 4/5 week old kitten at my job site. The girlfriend was most pleased with me that day.
Those ears!
So cute! xD
Cute
I’ve never had a cat but I’d take this one
That kitty doesn't need any help getting adopted
"I feel something on my face... what is this... Yech! why did I use my tongue for that?... That was a poor decision."
Remind me 3 days
Bullish
Thats not a cat, thats an effin teenager with a cat filter 👿
I just love these pictures! The first one took my heart with her.
Good person. Beautiful cat
this has been up for 4 hours so far - I'm assuming there is now a bidding war to adopt her
So much cuteness. I read down and I'm so happy to see the kitties will have a loving home!
Looks like the 4 poses in pokemon snap you have to try to achieve
There's gonna be a line out the door 😍
Aww. Reminds me of Hobbes
Took a page out of Calvin and Hobbes lmao

Looks cool
You captured all of her personalities and all of mine.
4th one is my soul animal.
Perfect! I want it!
Too cute.
I want her!!!
Op, the pictures show that you have a great sense of humor. Beautiful and endearing. Is the kitty a Maine Coon mix?
oh gosh. If you aren't deluged with requests for this cutie, people have straight up lost their minds. If I didn't already have one (plus two strays who think they own me, lol) I'd take her myself! :D
Can confirm, would adopt
The first picture is her McKayla Maroney imitation.
Dear god, take all my adoption money!!!!
I'm guess this kitty was adopted in near record time.
Your cat does the same things every other cat in existence has done? 

I for one am shocked.
Oh sign me up.
Purrrrfect
Haha, so many emotions so cute
Baby lion 🦁 wow 😮
Give us an update if the adoption works out OP
A completely normal kitty <3
haha this cat really got a bad personality, so badly cute
Maine Coon?? I love her
Get this cat adopted
RemindMe! 3 days
It's been 4 hours, so I'm assuming this excellent baby hellraiser has been adopted out already?
This...is the absolute cutest thing I've seen all day!! Thanks for brightening my day even more! 💞
RemindMe! 3 days
Love how brown spotted tabby kittens look like tiny bobcats.
That kitten understood the assignment! She gave exactly what needed to be given to get adopted!
This reminds me of Calvin from the “Calvin and Hobbes” cartoon. I forget why he’s making the faces.
I had a tabby cat too. He was adorable. Just had the shortest life span. :(
Post pictures of Soy Milk please!!  If as cute there won’t be any issues.
Top left and bottom right remind me of my old Pulgi! She was always angry or derpy 🖤
Reddit passed the Vibe Check! I hope this SnuggleMonster gets adopted!!!
Hobbes?
Where?? Nyc??  I’ll take it!
Yep! I’ll take her lol she’s so cute!
That tongue out photo is adorable. Will get her adopted for sure.
:/      :D



XO      :p
Last one got me. Such sass in such a small package.
Agahahahah gj bro.
That’s a Maine Coon. They are characters, for sure!
In Australia wish I could have this cat
What a magnificent blep!
I want this kitten.
Sweet baby. Looks like my Charlie who passed a few years ago of stomach cancer at age 15. Brought back some really awesome memories. He was the only little kitten I have rescued and adopted in 25+ years. Had kittens when I was a child. I would adopt that little one in a heartbeat. Alas, our baby who is 11 doesn't care to have other pets around. So spoiled. We're OK with that.
Lotsa personality!
Top left she looks like a gremlin, so  cute
1st picture - mean muggin the shit outta you or your camera 

2nd picture - ahhh yawn 

3rd picture - still yawning 

4th picture - what can I poop on
Curious to know how fast she was adopted
1. Judging you.
2. Thinking about eating you.
3. Laughing because she thought about eating you.
4. Forgot what she was laughing about.
Love the mini blep in bottom right pic
It's working. She's fucking adorable and I want her so bad!
Dude each of those is a mood. This cat is freaking adorable!
Awwwww i wish I could adopt her 🥺
Where is this gorgeous kitty. I would adopt her in a heartbeat

Purrfectly captured that sweet kitty cat
She knows what she is doing. She is getting the attention so she has a bigger pool of humans to choose from.
Definitely yes
Hello is this available for adoption? I would like it please. *Please* tell me it's located in AZ, USA

EDIT: to be clear I'm 100% serious I would adopt this cat in a heartbeat please
Quality

The four faces of Doctor Aww
If he doesn’t get adopted I don’t know what will
The ear tips - she's gonna big big or furry or both. Does she have little tufts between her toes?

Source: adopted similar looking kittens with ear tufts and fluffiness. Was told medium haired. Kittens kept growing. Now have "small" 16 lb Maine coon mutts. No regrets but so much fur.
Perfect photos!!!!!

Too adorable

Reminds me of the [Calvin & Hobbes strip where he can't sit still for a picture](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/fa/db/62/fadb6260446e55b1c3f3497c3dbaf29a.jpg)

Shelter cats are the best ill never get another cat from any where other then the shelter I currently have to both who I fostered then adopted and they're just so much more loving then any other cats I've ever been around I know it has alot to do with how you raise and treat them when there young but they act just like dogs thwy follow me around the house they wanna be next to myself or my gf 24/7 I cant praise adopting animals enough and its something I think everyone wanting a pet should consider!
Cutest little thing ever!
You, friend, have a talent!
The fact that these pictures look to be taken 3 seconds apart from each other AND you caught a blep, a yawn, a scowl, and a hungry lick. Astounding
I will take her right now

Oh my goodness, that would be a foster fail for me haha what a cutieeee
Aww, little buddy <3
"Huh?" "Sllurp" "yaaawn" "blep."
Nice
Our Animal shelter don't even bother to make pictures or to promote that they have Kittens, they get adopted really fast without all of that.

On the other hand older and disabled cats have mostly a hard time, especially if they are also not very cuddly or are more shy.
Rescue: Can we get a pic of her making an adorable  “blep” with her tongue out? 

OP:  Not a problem
I'm not the biggest fan of cats but that bottom right one is sooooo cute
Is kitty still up for adoption?
Upper left picture is the definition of “Stink Eye”
I can adopt her
Playful, talkative, loving?
Awww that lil blep 😍
Minefuckyouallitsminegivemenow
Give nao!
10 out of 10!! Would adopt!!!
Love them
Greebo?
Hrrrumf...mwellp...HI, HOW ARE YA!...ppppffft...how'd I do?
I’ll take your entire stock.
That cat has a bad attitude....I'll take her!
I want her! Where are you located?!?!?
May I have her please? 😁

Kidding, unfortunately my rescue is violently opposed to other cats, although I do kind of want to get a dog. She seems to get along with smaller pups.
Where is she, I’ll adopt her.
I would adopt this one in a heartbeat with those pics
I think we’re a match!
It's working, would adopt in a heartbeat!
How can you give that kitteh up? Too cute.
This reminds me of a Calvin and Hobbes strip where they are taking family photos and Calvin keeps making face.
I hate posts like this because I would love to adopt an animal or 3...but I just can't provide a good home for them right now, so it wouldn't be right.
I want it
lol perfect i mean purrfect
That is literally all of the personalities
Reminds me of eggen
Is it just me that made up little sound effects for each photo?
Adopted
Makes me think of Calvin & Hobbes, when it was picture day at school for Calvin.
I mean... where are you located?
Omg so precious! I love cats
I saw you mentioned that you were from Austin. I live 80 miles away and wish I knew someone who would take them both. 
I would but my mom stays with me and she basically told me not to bring another animal home. Because once they cross the front door, they never leave. Lol
Winner! Winner! Kitten Dinner!!
Amazingly cute!
I WANT HER

edit: I NEEEED HER!!
10/10 - would adopt.
I fucking hate cats and there's a 90% chance I would adopt that one.
RAWWWR *blep*
To be honest this is cat I would want.
The upper left photo gives me the Billy Idol upper lip sneer. I would adopt if I knew how to raise a cat and wasn’t allergic
gimme her now i need her
I’ll take her
omg, I know exactly where these came from!!! Hi fellow APA foster momma!
What a little muffin!!!! She’s so dang cute
That'll work.
Id keep
This feels strangely Calvin expressions
I like a sassy cat. I'd adopt based on the last pic.
1st one look like Meredith Grey😂
It could be a Normal Rockwell picture.  A Day in the Life of a ~~Boy~~ Kitten.

For reference,

You keep it that kitty is precious
Good pictures.
Can I have her?  She's precious.
So cute!!!!
Someone commented it looked like [Calvin’s school photos](https://imgur.com/gallery/SvEE69y)
The story from the first pic to the last pic is just adorable. Give me the kitty now!
WHERE CAN I ADOPT THIS MAGNIFICENT BEAST??????
That’s quite a derp you have there.
Based on those pictures she would be mine in a heartbeat.  Totally agree. Can’t foster because the would all be failures and I already gave 6 cats, lol
I'll take her right now haha. What a cutie pie!
I'll happily adopt.  Just taken on two kittens,  what's one more?
