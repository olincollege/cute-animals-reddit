I really thought the dog was gonna go right over.... but damn that was actually cooler! 
r/barkour
The little "nose lick" at the end looks like the dog version of a cool wink and a nod. 
Is that an Australian Shepherd? The face looks like a different breed though, i can't point it out.
Aussies are the best.    I found an Aussie by the side of the road hanging around a sandwich shop for handouts.  She had been there for several days.    My friends owned the shop and asked me to take her. I did.  No tags, looked really messed up.  After a bath, a visit to the vet and some good dog food, she was good to go.   This was about 30 years ago.   We live out in the country.  One day I came home from work and there was a bull and about 5 cows hanging out by my side door.  Not mine.  I slowly got out of the car and let Lucky out of her dog run and told her to round them up.  She started circling them and drove them  down away from the house into our pasture.  After that she came running up smiling like all get out.  Damn I loved that dog.   She was the best.

Rudy Mustang is a great name for a stunt dog.
r/wigglebutts for all your Aussie needs
I was really hoping for a barrel roll. Had Peppy in my head and everything.
It's neat how sometimes dogs seem to have complete body awareness (knowing they will fit perfectly through the gate) and other times they seem completely oblivious (several hundred pound dogs sitting in laps)
In case anyone is wondering: this is a blue merle Australian Shepherd

The mottled looking coloring comes from a gene that effects the coat. Without that gene, this dog would be black tricolor (think Bernese Mountain Dog coloring), but instead, it‚Äôs like someone splashed bleach on him, causing random dilution of color where it would be black.

Aussies can come in:

Black, black and brown, black tricolor 

Red (which can range from chocolatey brown to auburn), red and brown, red tricolor

And then merle versions of all of the above!

Though there‚Äôs also double merle. Where two merle Aussies are bred together, and about 1/4 of the litter gets two copies of the gene. And that results in primarily (but not always completely) white pups that have a high likelihood of blindness/deafness due to lack of melanin around the eyes and ears. Any respectable breeder would never breed two merles. 
Some scientists even speculate that dogs may see things in slow mo due to their high agility. So they Matrix life.
Farm dogs amaze me
That victory lick 
This is ridiculous... and amazing... 
Now someone edit this video with some tie fighters chasing the dog and exploding on impact!
P R E C I S I O N  B O Y E 
This is strangely r/oddlysatisfying. 
Our Aussie got caught on the other side of the fence the other day and did the same leap through. The funny part is, there was an opening to the fence like 2 feet from her, but she opted for the more dramatic entry. Such a diva.
This reminds me of the story about how my old dog Bexar was made, his dad and mom were never meant to breed, and we're separated by a 6 foot fence with a 3 foot underground cement wall.  They had no idea how, but that German Shepard was able to get in the Black Labs place, fuck her and then get back to his pen. I miss my Bexar...
Catherine Zeta Jones, she dips beneath the Lazer. Ooohhh oh ohh
Yeah I got skills, whatcha gonna do bout it
This dog is cooler than I will ever be. 
Have an Aussie. Can confirm the intelligence of these dogs. They are very busy, but I‚Äôve never had a more loyal and lovable dog. 
Barkour
Smooth
Impressive
This dog could slide into my DMs real easy.
Smooth af
this is more "oooowwhhhhh!!!!" than "awww"
Beautiful technique but he didn‚Äôt keep the smile the whole time so... 12/10 
That is a smart and coordinated doggo.  Completes the maneuver with total calm on his face, licking his chops and studying the master even while completing the maneuver.  Impressive doggos those Australian shepherds
https://i.imgur.com/fzIUhZJ.gif
Anyone else watch the legs move independently? Dogs are so cool. 
Australian Shepards,  wicked smart....probably worked out the angle , twist , and rate of speed with pencil and paper beforehand.
[deleted]
Got to love Aussies!  Mine would have plowed head first into the gate, but she‚Äôs blind so....
Its the nonchalant licking of lips that is so cool.
Very good üêæüçÄ
Prectice makes perfect.
We'll see if he gets into Notre Dame with those moves.
we don't deserve australian shepherds.
One small step for dog one gate leap for dog kind
Australian shepherds are  he bestest ever 
I have the feeling that this gif does not match this sub. To cool to be here.

I like how dogs know to naturally turn their bodies when doing that, but can't do the same when carrying a big stick through a door.

Australian Shepherds are the coolest! Too bad mine just bites the tires on my car when I try pulling out of the driveway... 
I think Aussies are the most frequent dog breed on the front page. If you‚Äôve ever owned on, then you know why!
I freaking love aussies. 
Dogo does an agile
that slowmotion though
Damn! he can slide into DMs smoother than I ever will

now THAT is a freakin' cool dog!!!
It looks like doggo gives a little smirk before jumping through as if they're saying "Watch this shit."
Get ready for the Olympics.....
Not "aww". More like : "woahh".
Oh my God that's Jason Bork!
Rudy Mustang...sounds like an East Germany porn star from the 80's :D

Otherwise, very nice. I wonder how dogs figure this out.
I just had the most powerful urge to applaud
Leap? More like dodge! 
"impressive...most impressive..." 
It's neat how sometimes dogs seem to have complete body awareness (knowing they will fit perfectly through the gate) and other times they seem completely oblivious (several hundred pound dogs sitting in laps)

Dude that was fucking sick
Barkour? 
He has the face of a dog that has nailed the bar a few times practicing that jump 
"Don't ever tell me the odds!
I suspect that this dog will have no problem carrying a stick through a door way.


That was glorious 
the Matrix, doggo style
Jason Borne style...
if he did a full spin through the bars.. that would have been the coolest ninja dog move ever... that was still cool too though
That dog looks high as fuck. 
I was thinking he was going over the top. That's damn impressive
Geez.


My dog tried to crawl through one and nearly yanked his cock off [the bone part of it caught on the lower part of the fence]. I had to go save him after he yelped and then got scared.
... come to think of it, my dog has injured his penis a lot.
Trained up dog. 
I'm waiting for someone to post a gif of their pug completely failing at being as majestic as this dog
This dog is obviously a fan of Jackie Chan.
This is the way John Cena moves to the ring dude.
I love his little shit eating grin on his way over 
Lazy bastard
That's impressive.  I threw a ball over the other side of our truck and our dog ran straight into the truck even though she started like 15 feet away from it.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not even mad he escaped, that‚Äôs amazing.‚Äù 
Perfect form, great execution.  I give it 10 out of 10 goodboys
Now where is the gif of the dog bouncing off the fence?

I think your dog should sign up for dog olympics for hudles. that is one amazing form!
This dog definitely got into the special brownies. Look dem eyes

How can this dog do this and all the other dogs can't figure out why they can't get through the door with their giant stick they found.
Neat, I see dogs go under the gate mostly. That's a talented dog.

He looks so cheeky.

Wow this is going to be a HUGE jump

Oh no, this dog is going to get hurt or stuck!

Oh jeesh, that was cool as heck!
So confident :)
That did not go how I thought it would, and for that, I am grateful
The nose lick of triumph.

I thought he'd woof on it
I‚Äôm not even mad, that‚Äôs impressive!!

Holy shit /r/bettereveryloop
This is some Matrix Neo level shit.
Even snuck in a quick nose lick. 
Didnt look at which /r/ this is posted to at first and I was sure he was gonna go facefirst into one of the bars
That is a Jackie Chan level move right there.
Meanwhile my dog tries to jump on the couch from too far away and face plants into the side instead
When I was a kid, we had a fence separating the backyard from the pasture. I had a free range dog and when I would call him to come eat he would come running full speed and jump right through a hole in the fence.
That‚Äôs a fucking farm dog right there. 
Is this an Aussie?

My dog can bearly walk
Woah it just flattened itself out and slipped through a seam in that fence!
Is your dog a pro wrestler?

Ha, I like how the dog closes its eyes almost saying, "hope this works..."

What breed is that?
Took a lot of fails to accomplish this I'm sure lol derp
He smiled like a kid jumping off the stoop with there parents watching
On one hand I'm disappointed it didn't jump over the top, and on the other hand I'm super fucking impressed it pulled that off.
Colour is wrong but it reminds me of Dog from *Footrot Flats*.

Australian Shepherds are so agile.  We had one when I was a kid who would climb ladders and hang out on the roof when we were repairing shingles, then we had another who would jump/climb a 6 foot tall chainlink fence.
After growing up on Footrot Flats finally seeing a dog jump like this makes me very happy. 
Brilliant! 
This is a dog who‚Äôs done this before!
Hardcore Pawkor
Holy shit this dog has bigger balls then I do. If I were dogs size, I would have thought "noooo, I'm going to hit my head, and that's going to hurt!" 

This dog's just like "Hold my water dish". 
That form though 11/10 
Holy shit, suicide dive.
r/gateleaping
Imagine the trial and error process for that kind of maneuver.
My dog would fuck that right up
That's my kind of dog!!! Minimal work, while still looking cool & skillful!
Every Australian Shepard we had on the farm did crazy stuff like this. Smart dogs.  
Mad skillz!
This is exactly why I wanted to agility train my dog. Nintendogs really set my expectation bar pretty high when I got my dog. 
And here my dog is unable to walk up stairs or jump on the couch. 
Licks lips. "That sweet sweet air"
That Aussie is getting it!!
It's the second time i see a dog doing this, is this a new thing among dogs? Some fence challenge or something like that? 
Well he's done that before

I was very nervous watching that jump. That doggo was doing me a heckin concern.
If a gif goes slomo on first play, then please add the normal speed version right behind it. It's cool to see the intricacies via slomo but I also want to see what this looks like in real life.
The tongue lick at the end was just the equivalent of the fonz flipping up leather jacket.

That looks so much like my Aussie that it's a little unnerving.

A perfect example of work smarter, not harder. 

Good Boye.
My dumb ass dog would have ended going to the vet trying something like that.
That lick of the nose at the end solidifies it for me. This needs to be one of those Thug Life videos.
