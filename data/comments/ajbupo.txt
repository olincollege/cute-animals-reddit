The cat is just laughing because you aren't using live humans to play the game.
Try Risk: 2210ad. It takes the game to a whole new level and you‚Äôll never go back to this version.
You can almost hear the evil laugh!
Growing up, we weren't allowed to play risk - not by my mom - but by the cat.

Risk, the game that turns friends into enemies
Risk is my favorite board game. My friends hated it because I just destroyed them constantly. Then everyone stood up and cheered. 
do you even realize how much extra sweet sweet up-poons u couldve gotten if you had only screen grabbed a still frame from video of your co exec producer dangling a petco toy above, causing kitty to reach paws up, thusly portraying maximum tyranny posture?
The cats just gonna swipe it all off the board and win. Lol.
Turtle Australia kitty!!!
Cat confirms earth is flat. Has just realised the potential 
Salem, is that you?
The sequel to Cats & Dogs is looking pretty good.
Doubt it'll actually happen. You'll probably shove the board on the floor in anger halfway through
Why does the **Pinky and the Brain** theme song play in my head when I see this?
Pull the lever, Kronk!
Must be an Australian mist breed.  They know.
You know he's thinking, "As soon as the board is covered in pieces, then I'll make my move.  Meowmuhahaha!"

Pretty sure the cat is actually laughing at people about to sit down to play Risk.

I love that game, but I would normally play online or in a computer to speed up the pace.  Actually rolling the dice would seem like a chore
My friend its 2019, don't play Risk...so many better board games out there, check out Blood Rage,Rising Sun or even Risk Legacy.
We knew the risks
If this were Axis & Allied I would say the best possible ending is a cat throwing all the pieces on the floor.

r/WhatsWrongWithYourCat
Are the pieces organized in square formation just for the photo, or am I a barbarian keeping all the pieces in a pile and picking a correct one from the pile when needed...
It is only a true diabolical laugh if you can put your fists on your hips as part of the stance. Not for kitty I'm afraid.
I like to imagine that the laugh that cat has is similar to when Yzma is turned into a cat in Emperor‚Äôs New Groove. Lol
Or at the very least allow you to play for a couple hours and then suddenly jump on the table and knock all of your shit off.
I know that feel.

Plot twist he's actually just choking on a soldier

Ah the game Risk. Grew up watching my family play it on vacations. As a kid around Christmas time dad took me to the mall and we bought Axis & Allies. Took it home and we played it for a little bit but then we packaged it back up like brand new, he wrapped it up with Christmas wrapping and put under the tree "From Santa". Mom was a little confused right away because she knew she didn't buy it. Hope one day I can have the same type of memories with my kids as I did with my dad.

No, that kitty is a modem /r/boardgames player and is expressing its frustration at "RISK again? When are we going to get to play my game - [**Root**](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root)?  Darn humans and their pre-Catan boardgaming."  I know this frustration well,though I will admit most I know have no time to play any games ("Those are for kids," they say mockingly as they turn on their Playstation 4s).  (Okay, that's a lie - I don't have friends. . . And at least my wife likes games.)
