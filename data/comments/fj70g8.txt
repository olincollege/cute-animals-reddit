That penguin looks very polite
I'm gonna eat you little fishy üéµ
I don‚Äôt know how safe or ethical this is, but if any zoo wants to do a series of them walking different animals around the zoo each day: I would not miss an episode!
The Shedd aquarium is amazing! Definitely a must see in Chicago.
Aww. His little mind is probably on overload right now.
I wish there was sound. I can only imagine the interesting sounds the penguin is making.
I always wonder what animals in places like this think when they see other animals. Like the giraffes at the zoo when they can see the polar bears three exhibits over like ‚ÄúUh....wtf is that??‚Äù
Kowalski. Analysis.
He‚Äôs picking out his dinner I bet.
üêß
‚Äúwait a second, are we on display like this too!?‚Äù
That‚Äôs a penguin looking at fish from the Amazon River. Quite the unlikely meetup!
This might seem pointless, but taking this penguin on a tour is something you'll never regret.
Penguin probably: what is this magical place??
Reminds me of those places where you get to choose your own fish/lobster to purchase.
Blessed video. Run and explore chonky one
COPYRIGHT CLAIM
Man, I always wonder how life would be if I worked at a Zoo.
COPYRIGHT CLAIM
It makes me so happy they do things like this. I love when they take the elephants out.
I love copyright claims
My boy Cody Maverick out here
Sad, can‚Äôt see the gif anymore :(
Err, I'll take 2 of them, 3, no 4, of them... now where's the krill section.
Worst. Buffet. Ever.

--The Penguin,  probably.
BRUH COPYRIGHT DID I ASK
Why and how tf was this taken down?
Copyright claim on a Gif? I've never saw that happen before.
DAMN YOU COPYRIGHT LAWS! DAMN YOU ALL TO HELL!
Frank!  They have been holding out on an entire buffet for us!  I have proof, I've seen it!
Wow copyright never saw this happen before
I want to see more Gifs like this
Sore losers
This got taken down, can some one link the video?
Copyright claim :(
Why did someone copyright this I'm just trying to have a good day look at cute things
Awwww it got copyright claimed
Lmao copyright claim
 Gotta fucking love copyright claims.
And then the penguin bitch slapped everyone on learning its "All you CANNOT eat" buffet
Imagine being this penguin.
I just went to the Shedd Aquarium a few weeks ago and the place was empty. Good for those penguins!
I want to see this guy and Confused Travolta wander around together.
Those Oscars look HUGE!!!
‚ô™**Food, food, magical food, GLORIOUS FOOD**‚ô™
The penguin looks slightly disappointed that it‚Äôs not a grocery shopping trip.
Penguin encounter is one of their attraction, regardless of being empty or not.  https://www.sheddaquarium.org/experiences/penguin-encounter.
I just started watching Westworld and this has more significance to me now.
‚ÄúWhat the fuck is this?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that??‚Äù
There has been a copyright claim sadly enough
Upvoting anyway because I‚Äôm sure it was very cute
FOR FUCK SAKE GFYCAT
"look at all this food!!!"
Noooot nooot
This is like the Truman Show but for Penguins
you mean you guys have a buffet out here?
Great. Now they know the escape routes. This is how you get Madagascar.
ALL THIS FOOD HERE! AND YOU DIDNT TELL ME!??
Even with their limited processing skills, these new visuals must be absolutely bonkers for an animal who's entire world is a single pen and maybe some backroom feeding/medical areas.
"Bro, how tf do I get in to the buffet section?"

-Penguin, probably
It's been unplugged from the matrix
The Shedd aquarium is boss af.
The fuck is this. 

The fuck is that.
Just watch out for Denarians...
I love these little guys, especially their Guy Fieri hairdos ‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ÄúKowalski, Analysis‚Äù
Kowalski are u getting this?
Nooo it copyright claim :(
It says copyright claim
I want to see more of this! Zoos should do this too and post videos of animals meeting each other
We need more stories like this right now.
This post was made by Misato
"Look at all of this good food that I can eat if I get out" -The Penguin *probably*
This makes me think of the penguins from
Madagascar the movie.
He looks like he has so many questions.
Must look like a fancy seafood buffet to him
*A whole buffet*
This is the cutest fucking thing I saw in a long time I swear
Smile and wave boys. Smile and wave
Fishies! Fishies! Fi~Oh. Hey Bob. Fishies! Fishies! Fishies! Fishies! Fishi~sup Bob. Fishies! Bob. Fishies!
Omg this is adorable af!
Smile and wave boys
Excuse you lift him up so he can read the plaque
I need more content like this, please.
Why they don‚Äôt take the fishes for a tour?
Is there a full video of this?
‚ÄúSkipper, we might need to free the pretty ones.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, Private. They‚Äôre staying *exactly* where they are.‚Äù
the way he looks around in the beginning... "what the...? this has been here the whole time?!?"
Smile and wave boys, smile and wave.
They need to live stream the entire tour for people who are sitting at home and can't go into work!
you ever wonder what goes through an animals head..
"Why are you teasing me with all this food??" The penguin, probably
Oh fuck it‚Äôs so cool to know I‚Äôve been standing in the same place this famous penguin is standing in since I was 6
confused_travolta.gif
kowalski, analysis !
I no understand how I look up at fishes
I require a full episode of said tour.
‚ÄòYou mean to tell me you keep all kinds of fish here?! And you DON‚ÄôT feed them to ME?! Bruh!‚Äô
finally some GOOD FUCKING FOOD
Where‚Äôs his surfboard.
I love it! The penguin looks so curious about the new snacks floating around.
The cruelist buffet line.
Oh to be an animal trainer with no guests to cater to!!! I would have had a blast with my dolphins with weeks without guests!!!!
He‚Äôs so cute and yet very bewildered. ü§î
"Carl, judging by the composition of this glass, it's density is significantly likely to be too strong for us to peck through w/ our beaks.  Therefore, waddle on over to the rhino enclosure, and see if they're free for lunch."
This is so cool. I love penguins. They're awesome. He's just like "Hey, what's this. Okay. Interesting. And this one. Good, good. Well, let us go to the next exhibit. Wait, what? I'm the next exhibit? Curious, very curious."
The motherfucker now knows where the keys are. He'll be gone a week from now.
It is doing it's best human tourist interpretation
I bet this was some very Truman Show-esque shit this penguin was going through
I bet it's mouth watering for him to see all the fish.
Seems like a good idea until night rolls around, staff go home and the penguins bust loose because they just toured the floor plan.
Now that penguin is going to go back and tell all the other penguins what he saw, and no one will believe him!!!
Ol PenPen
Intense confusion displayed
Great, now they have the entire layout.
Crazy idea for a zoo. Bring all the animals (reasonable) to walks around zoos and see how this awareness of other animals affects them. Maybe it's positive for their mind.
Look! He thinks he‚Äôs people!
I LIVE IN CHICAGO AND IM SO TEMPTED TO GO TO THE SHEDD AQUARIUM TOMORROW AND HANG OUT WITH THE PENGUINS SINCE ILL PROBABLY BE THE ONLY VISITOR THERE AND THEY‚ÄôLL BE TAKING THEM OUT AGAIN üò≠üòç
Oh my gosh its an Ice Chikin
This is beautiful
I live 4 hours from Chicago and I go the the Shedd Aquarium usually once a year, it‚Äôs an amazing experience and love bringing new people along to experience it with.

Definitely would recommend a cityPASS it lets you go to the Aquarium, museum, and planetarium and a few other minor attractions like the Willis tower top floor. Which I‚Äôm going to be honest, you should definitely go when it‚Äôs dark out. The city lights look beautiful from that high up. Plus it‚Äôs not as crowded.
Cuute
This is fucking claimed. I'm starting a war
Copyright claim :(
BUFFET!
That's one confused birb
They should do that with the other animals. Sharks would like that.
‚ÄúJust smile and wave boys‚Äù- penguin probably
That poor bird is like look at all the exotic food these ass holes have been holding out on!! Wait till I get back and tell the emperor!!!
As long as it's not a 3 hour tour on the USS Minnow.
I bet they met so many new friends!
‚ÄúBuckle up, boys! Don‚Äôt look, doll, this might get hairy.‚Äù
That looks like the same type of penguin from Neon Genesis Evangelion lol
Fuck man, this is the cutest stuff I‚Äôve seen in a while.
OMG. This is awesome.
He looks so curious
Omg this is incredibly cute
That‚Äôs so cute
smile and wave boys, smile and wave
Kowalski, analysis!
I knew it! I live in a simulation!
That‚Äôs so sweet
Awww I miss the shedd aquarium! I'll see you soon buddy!
Wow all those fish just for me
They should do that all the time! When the zoo closes and no one is around! It's perfect to let the little guys wander
Little penguin is looking at his next meal
How confusing would it be to ‚Äúsee‚Äù underwater right in front if you but not be able to swim on it?
Omg I love this!!!!!!!!
He's very happy he's finally made it to "the other side"
Pretty sure that's danny devito
"Look at all this food we've been hiding from you"
They tried walking a fish, but it wasn't interested.
Penguin: "oh wow, hey this looks nice! Wow, look at that. Woooow!"
Future restaurants to visit next time they get out.
The shedd in chi? Lol sweeeet
Imagine being put into an Alien zoo.

One day the Aliens had a day of quarantine so your zookeeper decided that on this one day he'd give you a taste of where you've been living the last 50 years.
This is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen amidst the panic these days.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been hiding all this food from me?‚Äù
I can show you the world....
Westworld (2016)
I never thought that other concient animals would even be curious about this kind of stuff and he definitely does whether its lunch or not I'm sure hes thinking hes never sen these before!
bruh why don't the fish get a tour smh
‚Äú god damn it Karen! This buffet sucks!‚Äù
He looks like he's thinking 'this is cool and all, brah, but what's really up?'
IS THERE MORE OF THIS???
He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWould you look at that? Just look at it! Look at this!‚Äù
Is it just the penguins? I bet the lions would enjoy a tour, too lol
Prro lol guy be like....Wtf!? Flying fish? What is this?
Cute little rockhopper
The penguin is mesmerised by what it's seeing, see the way it's moving from one side to another and thinking lunch is served, where do i start from
I do this with my Chinese water dragons most morning
I need more!
Aww I havent been there for years. I really love that aquarium to.
That must have blown his little mind.
So much to see. He doesn't even know where to look first üòÇüòçüòçüòç
That penguin looks pretty inquisitive. I‚Äôm curious if he‚Äôd recognize his own reflection.
That penguin thinks he's died and gone to heaven.
It‚Äôs confused, he‚Äôs in the human spot, I can sympathize
He‚Äôs came dressed for a formal ball, but he‚Äôs starting to think something fishy is up.
AWWW
I wonder if he recognizes anyone from the old country.
My man got drip
Are those black bar silver dollars? Jesus wept I had no idea they got that big.
They should let them loose in there every so often as a treat.
i like to think that zoos do this all the time.
Planet of the Penguins movie coming soon?
More content plz
I want some volume
I love birds. They're curious little fuckers aren't they
Greatest animal on earth üêß
Now do the same with the fish
You mean torment. All those fish and he can't eat any of them.
Cute!
‚ÄúNow this is all the food your missing out on‚Äù
I expected more penguin
Bro. Am I tripping?
Please post more updates <3 <3
Wow these are interesting food items, why are they not in my stomach?
Came to Chicago for the weekend to see the aquarium. Planetarium and museums, but they closed down the first day we got here. So we‚Äôve just been hanging out in our hotel. Worst luck ever, lol. Oh well it‚Äôs for a good cause, stay safe everyone.
I fucking love penguins so much
Dude‚Äôs making a mental note of the locations for the dinner and lunch buffets
Awww üòç
Feels similar to a scene from Westworld when Maeve walks around the Delos building
Those are some good looking Oscars.
Is there a full video? I need approximately 10 minutes of this.
This is exactly the plot of 12 Monkeys
Something about animals brightens up my day. I love this.
Wait, Shedd is empty? It's an hour long drive from here, I'm on my way
That penguin is probably tripping on all the other animals, probably not used to seeing other creatures other than humans and smaller humans.
‚ù§Ô∏è
Cute snow birb.
Serious question - Is there any impact on the penguins having this type of freedom and then being returned to their enclosures? Do they have the ability to recognize that? 

Not looking for debate just general curiosity
when /r/aww  becomes /r/awesome!
Ah, we're at the vending section and my walker is hoarding the coins :(
Welcome to the other side
And then they got penguin flue.
I can walk like a penguin. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddBt5p-Uqew
When i saw the penguin the first thing that comes to
My mind is Robin Williams.
Aww, lol Gunts
What kind of dog is this?
I wanna see this but at zoos and with chimps
This is exactly how 12 Monkeys started
‚ÄúIs this...food?‚Äù
Poor little guy looks very confused üò¢
Maybe it's because I'm already in a good mood today.....this post made me happy.
kowalski report!!
All this food on display and he gets those crappy sardines...
Neo found out he was in the matrix
A three hour tour...
We loved visiting the Shedd Aquarium in February 2019!
Next take the fish on a tour
[deleted]
This is legit the best thing I have ever seen
Hes like, BRO i see fish in front me but where's the water BRO am I high
‚ÄúGoddamn look at all that food‚Äù

This fills my heart so freakin much.
Everyone liked that
Man this really made my day. Very much needed after all this stress and bullshit
Wait till one stamps into a glass wall for some fish.
Birds cannot see glass.
I love Shedd Aquarium!! This is so cute.
"Is the new dinner menu?? How do I choose?!"
This is wholesome
He's like, put me up in that aquarium, then I'll be fine
Omg I want to take him home and buy him all the aquariums.
Me looking at the menu before deciding to have what he's having
Confused penguin is confused
GAVIN!!
".... so this is the buffet huh?"
Their kids will never believe them.
AHHHHHHH SO CUTE ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Makes me want to go rewatch surfs up
Penguin: OH MY GOSH WHY IS THE WATER FLOATING IN THE AIR IT'S NOT SPILLING OUT
The penguin: The fish, all of them.
This dude is walking around looking like he just escaped from the Truman Show and is learning his entire world is a lie.
Yes I‚Äôll have that one one right there please! 

- The penguin probably
How adorable! I also loved this aquarium when I visited a few years back. Would love to go again someday :)
‚ÄúOmg, this shit looks totally like a real life Westword, Dave! Mind blowing!!
Having an existential crisis
I hope they continue to do this even after it reopens every morning. Its got to be the most mental stimulation the poor things get.
He should really have a mask on...
Best enrichment ever!
I didn't even think how, even though an aquarium/zoo might be closed, a lot of the people that work there must do their jobs as normal. Still have to feed and clean and such
This sub is definitely going to help me get through this shit!
Man I feel bad for those birds , they‚Äôre almost like cam girls , you can see in the reflection another bird is also being filmed at the same time .
Aww. I want more of the penguins reactions to the other exhibits. Its something not normally seen and it would be soo cool to see their reaction to different things. Kind of like a baby or a child but with a penguin.
Like going in to a restaurant you can‚Äôt afford.
He found a buffet

‚ÄúDude you have an all you can eat buffet here and you just keep me in my room?!‚Äù
All dressed up but no parties to go to

What a freaking adorable penguin
They are so damn cute
The man's looking at fish. Leave him alone.
I wish he was my son
I would watch PenguinCam all day.
Love shedd
Jesus, idk why I want to hear his confused silence so badly.
That's like taking a fat kid window shopping at the bakery.
Can we make a zoo where it's purpose is to show different animals meeting new animals?    


Like this, but a new animal excursion each week
I need voiceover for this shit.
Da fuk? Da fuk? Da fuk? Da fuk?
Poor guy looks like a Pauper looking into the window of a butcher shop
I want to go to Shedd even more now
It's crazy to think that no penguin ever would see those fish if it weren't for humans and their virus ways
I think he wants to say that he believed fish aren't real (especially living ones)
Is that a yellow eyed penguin?
He‚Äôs just doing surveillance *laughs in Madagascar Escape 2 Africa*
That birb‚Äôs mind has been blown
Penguin checking out the dinner buffet
PenPen looks kinda confused like why are these fish not in my mouth???
Exotic food museum
‚ÄúHow does one... uhh.. get to the fish?....‚Äù
"Mother****er, I know what fish look like. I've hunted them, caught them in my mouth and listen for many trips home as they begged for their life. We're familiarized. Now, W.. T.. F. is that goofy long nose havin' giant mfer over there?"
how foolish. now they know the layout there's no stopping them
Mine mine mine mine
I need more of this. What did the penguins think of the reptiles? Or what about the other birds?! I need answers
Teenyverse
The penguin is fascinated in all the fish
Now they know all the exits!!!!
IS THIS MY EXISTENCE?!
None of the other penguins are going to believe his wild adventures when he gets back.
Great now all the other animals are jealous and waiting on their own private tours
Did they bring the fish out as well?
A beautiful coat he has, shiny it is.  Healthy, he must be.
Trying to pick out that perfect piece for dinner .
I love seeing various animals interact with other animals at the zoo. There was the dolphins/squirrels yesterday, now this. Add that to the elephant looking at the (?penguins?) Can't remember what was in the tank but the elephant just looked so happy. 

I hope to see more videos like this now that all these places are closed down.
If a penguin doesn‚Äôt touch or knock on the glass with fishes behind it, PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONTAIN THEMSELVES NOT TO EITHER. That is all.
The look on the penguins face at the beginning.
"Should... Should I be out here?? Ooh."
"Look at all you motherfuckers just swimming around in a tank! Im out here with this bitch, im a free penguin now!"
I'm really enjoying this even for a penguin lover
‚ÄúI‚Äôm in the wrong tank wtf‚Äù
So adorable!
It's like taking a kid to a donut shop and telling him he can only look
What the fack! The fishes are flying! Tf why can't I fly! Fack!
This is the type of content I need right now. This made me very happy.

This is a 12 Monkeys situation right here ... bring a few animals for a tour of the zoo, soon they will be out in the city!
This is one of the perks
That's what I look like at McDonald's waiting to order
Just smile and wave boys, smile and wave
I love how curious he looks. He looks like he's genuinely excited to see all these strange new fishies.
What a trippy experience for that penguin.
Penguin: there‚Äôs so much food
Why dont they take the fish out for a tour?
aaaaaaa
He probably thinks he‚Äôs there to choose his dinner.
Stupid humans show us everything, now we plan!
I Love This.
Penquin: can I eat these??

Guide: no, paulie. You cant.

Penguin: what about this one--?

Guide: no
This brought me to tears
I just cannot find a way to express how wholesome this is!
Hey is that summary on that sign right?
Forbidden buffet. :/
It's like giving you a tour of a buffet without letting you eat anything
I was there one day and during the dolphin shows they brought out sea lions and penguins (separately) and one of the penguins went right up to me and in between my legs, I‚Äôll have to find the video 

Edit: [Found it](https://imgur.com/gallery/62oooOX)
My daughter and I love the shed and we go every other weekend. The penguins are amazing. We love the otters too
I live in a...what!?
Lovelace is loving it
"Awwww yissss new friends!!!"
Did they let them pick out their own fish?
Mr Popper?
Best source of income atm for establishments that can't actually close will be cute YouTube content and the merch generated from said content. Be experimental with these few weeks everyone. We're all desperate for stuff to watch anyway.
"Just smile and wave, boys. Smile and wave."
It‚Äôs almost as if the penguin prefers not being in a cage and on display.
Encore!!
 "Writing this review to warn future visitors to this subpar establishment. Waiters were pushy, wouldn't let me have any quality fish, just sardines. Also a manager yelled at me for shitting on the floor. 3/10 will not visit again."
I'm worried about places like this losing too much money better they need to be closed. Is there a way to support them?
You gonna open the buffet, or what?
Love that place.
‚ÄúWhat do you mean, ‚Äòthey aren‚Äôt for eating‚Äô???‚Äù
Penguin> Holy shit!
Why do penguins need trainers?
Awwww too cute!  I nickname these pengies ‚Äúpredator pengies‚Äù their head resemble the predator‚Äôs helmets from the movie. The emperors are ‚Äútux pengies‚Äù.

This is the new John Travolta Pulp Fiction meme, isn't it?
It‚Äôs all fun and games until the penguin realizes they‚Äôre being held captive. Then the penguins band all of the sea creatures together and rally a revolution together.
Thought I was on r/hockey for a sec
Luv it

This almost out me in tears due to the awww-ness. It's so beautiful to see animals exploring and being naturally curious

During crazy times, it's wholesomeness like this that get me through it.
MUST HAVE MORE PENGUIN VIDEOS
Fantastic news :") thank you for sharing
It's a little bit sad to be honest.
This is so incredibly touching
Young Cody searching around for Big Z.
I really wanted audio to hear the flop flop of him walking
When I'm out of bounds
The penguin enclosure at the St Louis zoo is pretty open.  Like, there's nothing between you and them, just a height difference.  After hours the penguins will hop down and have their own penguin parties at night.  The keepers have to put up little ramps so they can get back in before the zoo opens, lol.
Fuck this is so cute

What a polite young man!
 little guy just realized he‚Äôs in captivity
In my hometown we had a zoo where the penguins could walk around freely.

One of the penguins got lost on the walk path and managed to follow some visitors to the part where visitors could watch the penguin enclosure from underwater.

The other penguins were all interested in how their friend managed to get to the other aide of the glass.

That was by far the best visit to any zoo I ever had. (And we had a season pass to that zoo and visited it at the least once a month)
Cody maverick??
I just love penguins.
"You'll be my snack, and you'll be my second snack, oh and you'll be my dinner."
Aw what a great day <3___<3
Wow I must say that Penguin has more manners than most humans out there.
I like how it stops to read the sign.
Interesting how it didn't appear afraid of the shark. I wonder if it just didn't see it or if it knows its safe behind glass
Smile and wave, boys, just smile and wave!
Fooooooooood!

Am SOOOO disgusted!!!! Like parading a wall o Jimmy John's just beyond my reach. Cruel cruel cruel Shedd Aquarium..... you torturous bastards
This is so f‚Äîking cuuuuuute!
 God damnit this is too fucking adorable. Love penguins so much.
I badly want some more videos like this about ways that the widespread shutdowns are allowing for some positive encounters! I love this, it‚Äôs a little ray of sunshine
More please?
Are those piranha in the left tanks?
I'm adding words based on the Madagascar movie penguins......
‚ÄúHow do I access the buffet?‚Äù
They should be in the wild
I would not look any different
Oh, this is the sweetest thing I‚Äôve seen in a while. It‚Äôs like he is a bit overwhelmed (in the best way) and it makes me want to hug him.
I need sound
Why not take the fish on a tour
‚ÄúLook at all these fishes‚Äù
r/youseeingthisshit/
Penguin: Karen let me borrow a dollar for the vending machine. I left my money in my other tux!
Penguin: Should have told me your taking me to the buffet, I forgot my wallet in my other suit.
PENGUIN ON A TOUR

what will he do?
Penguin: And you said grocery store shelves were empty?!
He's looking around like "Where the hell am I????" Lol
The head swivel. Seriously. OMG.
‚ÄúWhat... what the... what the fuck is this place? Tom. Tom? What am I looking at here Tom?‚Äù
Is it closed? Or does no one want to go?
Lunchtime
someone needs to take the dolphins on a zoo trip. 

Given how interested they were in squirrels it would be really cool to show them all sorts of different animals.
Omg this needs to become part of your schedule permanently.
Bro he Kinda do be chilling tho
THIS THE QUALITY CONTENT I AM ON THE INTERNET FOR!
what if he's terrified?
Trying to look everywhere at once.

¬´¬†What a smorgasbord!¬†¬ª
Smile and wave boys, smile and wave.
Penguins are awesome!
Hmmmmm, I'll take *that* one!
That's like watching the food network.
Aw fuck that is cute
If an animal can resist taping the glass then people should be ashamed of themselves.
Awesome!
Is that a Macaroni penguin?
u/worstjinxuniverse
boycott all zoos
OP, you at the Shedd? I‚Äôm at the Field. We can‚Äôt have this kind of fun with fossils.
I love how excited this penguin is. This could be cross listed in r/mademesmile
This mf confuuuuused
KOWALSKI ANALASYS
He looks like a 5 year old kid at the aquarium for the first time.
Too bad the video was so short I could of watched an hour of that

Kowalski! Status report?
Oh my God I love penguins now

This makes me so happy my heart hurts. So cute!
penguin b trippin
This was always the best field trip as a kid.
This is wonderful
me at the shedd
Oh God, I'm melting. That's the sweetest, most adorable and so confused little furball I've seen in a long time.

"Why fishos flyings?!"
Now they can plot their escape
Penguins don't have knees. I hope this messes up someone's life like it has myn
Food? Food?
This is the wholesome content I need!
"Bro are you seein this shit? What the fuck"
Is there a full length video of Mr. Penguins Zoo Tour? I am trying to work, but I could procrastinate for a couple hours and watch him meet all the different animals.
The best part about this is how he keeps looking back at the human like ‚Äúbro are you seeing this??‚Äù
That could be a new way of getting zoo in right direction.
Crosspost this to /r/youseeingthisshit
Penguin looks like he‚Äôs about to give me free healthcare
That penguin looks pretty confused!
Kowalski, analysis
That little bird‚Äôs brain is blown.
I need more of this please
The fish look equally entertained
üêß‚ù§Ô∏èaww!
The mass confusion of being next to fish, while being dry and they aren't panicking
I could watch an hour of this. Wish there was more.
My mom used to work there back in the 80's and 90's.  I really miss the Shed...she would take me behind the scenes to see some real cool stuff.
"Oh my god... Oh my god! Guys! Guys are you okay!? What is this?! You monsters!!"
Penguin: *approaches the piranha exhibit*


Me: [softly] Don‚Äôt...
‚Äúwtf, wtf, wtf, are you seeing this? wtf, wtf, wtf‚Äù
Lil‚Äô man about to preach to the rest of the penguins about these ‚Äúother worlds‚Äù and start a new religion.
I really hope that penguins evolves to a humanoid species.
Blowed his tiny penguin mind
pat pat pat pat
Westworld season 3 tie in?
What about the otters!
*quickly looks at both tanks back and forth, looks at trainer* 
Penguin:Y'all better tell me why they got teeth...  or my wings go from flappin, to slappin
Lunch seems to be protected by some sort of force field.  :(
R/wholesomememes
"What the fuck is going on here, Barbara?"
"Witchcraft!"
I also live in Chicago, how are you holding up?
That guy that does the cram videos needs to get on this
Is that an Adelie, Chinstrap, Emperor, or Gentoo?
More like torture...looking at all that food he can't have.
That‚Äôs unfair! Can they take the fish for a tour too?
He‚Äôs thinking....‚Äùoh my god, they have everyone captured, not just us‚Äù
This is how you give a penguin several neuroses
This is the uplifting news I needed today
That is very cute. But I know what penguins smell like,  you'll never get me to go back inside one of those enclosures.
That‚Äôs cool üòé!
Grandpa Munster of the penguin world
r/likeus
Which one can I have?
He will never forget that day.
Adorable
Wonder if Batman will show up too...
Bless his little flappers
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen on this sub since I subscribed. I love this so much
Chicago, IL.
This is how it starts....
/r/penguin

NVM already there :-)
I love how he keeps looking back like "...are you seeing this?"
More!!!
"I'm a visitor, hurdurdurr."
he's having fun
Tour-ture... they are just realizing their life has been nothing but a lie.
Wow!
Awww yeah. Now this is better than drugs.
PEN PEN!!! I remember the scene where they went to a aquarium in Evangelion 2.22.
Field trip!
There's fresh fish everywhere and your serving us the frozen ones?
That‚Äôs how we look to the guys making sushi.
Kawalski, what's the situation?
This makes me wonder if penguins would like scratches or belly rubs. I‚Äôd love to have a little dude as a pet. Just sit on the couch next to him and watch something, give him a fish and a scratch every so often
Me if I had penguins
Smile and wave boys
So, I just realized that zoo penguins when swimming would usually have tons of wildlife to look at. Probably in most places they have nothing in their enclosure except each other and of course allll the people looking at them. Now I‚Äôm sad for penguins. Why am I like this.
The penguin said, " Oooooh fish"
"Look at all that food! Oh fuck, that big one thinks I'm food."
r/youseeingthisshit
Susan! Susan!? Look at these fucking fish. All here for our taking!
This. 
Is.
Fucking Adorable.
I love that Aquarium
TIL tour is aquarium speak for window shopping.
Hold up.. those fish look like giant tiger barbs.

Also, that bird is adorable. He wants to go swim in all the tanks!
New Linux kernel has been released
Wait till he reports back to his crew.
Does anyone have the original video with sound?
The penguin is like: you seeing this shit
Tomorrow: we'll taken the lions on a tour!
Like giving prisoners a tour of the prison from the guards perspective
tux is trying to escape
"You mean to tell me there are different exhibits here besides the humans I'm forced to look at every day?"
üòçüòç love the penguins
Are you a trainer?
The people at the zoo will treat you veeeeeery respectable like
Even the fish are amazed XD
hmmm.. look at all this food I can't eat!!!
Love it!!
I want one!!!
Kowalski...take notes.
I love penguins. I promise to stop by to see this guy when the monsters go away and I can go out again.
r/youseeingthisshit
Omg I just want to hug and squeeze them.
The menus look Amazing at these restaurants.
Aww did they close the aquarium?
He goes back and tells other ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been to other side...‚Äù
So cute.
Humans are in quarantine, penguins get let out of quarantine ü§î
