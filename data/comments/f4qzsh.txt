Be careful man, it starts off ironic then before you know it you're buying your jeans at the same place as your groceries.

Good luck!

edit: Grammar
Just missing the phone holder on the belt. But we'll let you off easy this time cuz you've only recently been inducted into fatherhood.
Why wouldn't she let you buy New Balance? Those shoes are sensibly priced, very comfortable, withstand alot of stuff and......

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Oh. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Oh no.
lol your wife is like "Great, take your picture you fucking asshole."
No cargo pockets. Wrong shirt. 
9/10 nice!
And when you're wife gets discharged from the hospital, you have to grab her bags and say "let's rock and roll!"
> my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me buy dad shoes

This is the dad-est thing ever.
Congrats on the soon-to-be-bought beige Members Only jacket.
My dad has those shoes too! I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm surprised.
Mom - Lying in a hospital bed after being ripped open during child birth

Dad - Hey darl won‚Äôt it be funny if I play dress up. Hey hun, won‚Äôt that be funny hun. Just smile for the camera hun.
Your wife looks amazing for having just given birth.
I sure as hell wasnt that peppy.

Look at the baby hair sticking up......  *talks in nonsense baby voice*
I 100% intend on buying my boyfriend a pair of those shoes as a way of announcing my pregnancy when we have babies in the future. I‚Äôm disappointed your wife wouldn‚Äôt let you buy some what are you supposed to grill meats and mow the lawn in now?
Congratulations to you and especially your champ of a wife!
Nurse here:the fact that you put your shoe on the bed skeezes me out. The floor is the dirtiest thing in the hospital.
You‚Äôre gonna look at this picture in 10 years think you don‚Äôt look half that bad.

Edit: word
Go Utes.
Lol your wife‚Äôs face- ‚Äújust take the damn picture and get this over with.‚Äù
She looks thrilled..
New moms are great. Just performed a heroic physically impossible act of pushing a human through their body... But yeah all you man. You meme with our firstborn.

My wife was the same way.
Congratulations!
Ugh...    dad shoes don't make me cringe. But dirty, old shoes on a hospital bed still being used...
Keep the manky shoes off the hospital beds please. Infections are real!
Hey go Utes!
New Balance are a high quality shoe! Made in America too. My son is 1
Hey fellow Utahns, congrats
Oh man I just sent this to my wife (4 months pregnant). She said, ‚ÄúDo that and you‚Äôll leave the hospital with no baby and no wife.‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Pull your pants up you slob!
If you're not going to wear jean shorts, at least find some cargo pockets on those bad boys...
Please give me karma!  Having created life is not enough for me.
Imagine being concerned with internet points when you‚Äôre about to become a parent.
Thanks for sharing this very personal moment with me, a total and complete stranger. Now I know how your family looks.
A baby is not a prop.
Just raise your kid you twat. This isn‚Äôt about you and your Instagram anymore. 

Congrats tho
Love the commitment to the bit. Also those water jugs are better than money can buy. Get one for yourself and keep it. They might not even charge you for it.
This sub has gone to shit. People have babies we get it.
Wtf is this garbage, /r/aww is turning into /r/pics
No offense to the OP but can someone point me towards some cute subs that don't allow kids and whatnot?
No flip phone?

When does a joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent.
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have made today about you?

Edit: yeesh. Didn‚Äôt think this would get such a response. Only reason I said what I said is because of the mom‚Äôs face. She doesn‚Äôt look like she‚Äôs part of the joke. Plus the title. I‚Äôm all for silliness and weird fun but only if everyone is in on the joke.
I find your lack of fannypack disturbing
You just had a baby yet you turn to strangers online to beg laughter at your costume.
So dumb
Cringe this
Imagine pimping your newborn child out like this for meaningless internet points.  
Grow up.
Nothing says you are ready for fatherhood like the act of making the birth of your first child all about you.
That lady is a very understanding woman
Congrats, it's my cake day btw
13 or 33
Now, what color minivan do you fancy?
How are you so powerful a father already??
This is amazing! Congratulations!
[removed]
Newborns are objectively ugly. And it‚Äôs a guy dressed like a dork. How the fuck is this aww?
Nothing is aww in this pic
Omg his dad shoes are on the bed. No! Bad dad!
You just look like you work at trader Joe's
You look like you're going to be a great family, and a sense of humour is essential. Congratulations, and welcome to the journey.  BTW, there is no set destination, and enjoy the detours.
Piece of advice buy clothes one year bigger in advance they grow so damn fast
Just shipped: Fanny pack, Patagonia Baseball Hat, Flip-up sunglasses.
I‚Äôm not a dad but have those shoes....
My youngest is 9 and my wife regrets the day she broke her big-ass water mug she got during her delivery. That's the only place I've ever seen those things. Tell your wife to treasure hers.
Socks are missing stripes
I can relate to the look on her face... lol
The next few weeks will not be fun for your wife, pretend you are at war, red alert mode when helping the wife.  She needs privacy and help all you can offer and more!
Wife‚Äôs boyfriend must be so proud üòä
Your wife looks like a real trooper, partially for delivering a beautiful healthy baby but mostly for putting up with you! Congratulations!!
Cool so you just had a baby and you still wanted to make it about you. Not the new baby or your wife who just gave birth.
No offense to OP, but why is r/aww getting packed with newborn babies? I get seeing it once in a while if it's a baby doing...something, but these pictures are just weird. You reproduced. Your wife's body is still in great pain and attempting to heal. Your baby is crying and reminiscing about the void from which you've plucked it from. Lol. Nothing adorable about these pictures.
Lay off the soy
BETA Male
[removed]
Oh cool, another human...
Geez your poor wife just went through all that and all you care about is you. Maybe thank her for all she just went through?
Wow. She looks thrilled that you are exploiting this moment for reddit points. Fuck you asshole.
I really hate when couples go my wife/ husband wouldn't let me buy it, etc. Talk about controlling.
She's wondering how soon she can get out of there to meet up with her boyfriend.
[deleted]
I just want to tell your wife, lady to lady, I have **NEVER** seen a new mother still in the hospital that that looked so refreshed & content. 

She's not pale, has no bags under her eyes and looks like she's actually feeling pretty damn good. 

I just want to tell her I have no doubt she did amazing, she looks great & I hope she feels proud of herself. 

Anyway, you will both be amazing parents & I wish you a lifetime of happiness
grown ass people still trying to act young and cute how ironic. your fucking life is over stop pretending you are still young
Do people really ask their wife's permission to buy a pair of tennis shoes? Seems like the sort of thing you would just go do.
Not an Aww post in any way.  
Upvotes & positive comments are being purchased for these _"look at me - I chose to breed"_ posts.  
I think it's pretty clear what the motivation is but I'll let you figure it out for yourself.
Those are your shoes now.

That's how it happens, the shoes are passed down from dad to dad. Why do you think dad's take such good care of their shoes and why they smell so bad?

It's a tradition.
I bought a pair of Brooks shoes just to see if I'd like them.  I'm 38 and now love old man shoes.
White New Balance tennis shoes ***AND*** New Balance Socks!? You madman.
Long term dad here, what's funny about that outfit? I don't get it.
Should have worn leather sandals with those socks, in true dad fashion
That kid is already embarrassed
I just love that your dad has the shoes.
I swear every hospital has that red and green footprint blanket for babies.  We took a bunch of those home
Nike Air Monarchs or Nike Shox are quickly becoming the deFacto dad shoe replacement for New Balances.
OP, there is nothing wrong about having a sensible pair of shoes. Welcome to the dad club.
Good luck now for your sleepness nights and yeah congratulations !!
Dad shoes don't have to be NEW Balances. They just need to be all white and worn for every situation.
Say what you will...the comfort of those kicks is second to none.

Your dad wears them for a reason!

Congrats!!!
Congrats to you and your wife in your bundle of joy. Gotta get those Dad jokes ready .
Can we get a update photo after a month of no sleep please.
At first your like , hey it‚Äôs funny . Then next thing you know your thinking of comfort fashion .. yep , it‚Äôs how it starts .
You can‚Äôt fuck a man who wears white new balance. Nope nope nope.
Should have gone with the socks/sandals combo. Still, nicely done.
Ummmmm... is it bad that I already own those shoes and the long white socks? But congrats man! Looking pretty dad with that outfit!
Tucked in Hawaiian shirt- you are there!
No joke, you look exactly like my dad in the 90s... Mission accomplished.  & congrats!
Sorry to critique, but should really have been sandals with socks. Also, that waistline on the shorts needs to be brought up a few inches.  A wide-brimmed Tilley hat would help complete the look
Dammit i have those shoes
Congratulations!! It suits you well.
I think you‚Äôll make a great dad! üë∂üèº
Your child shows the appropriate reaction to a dad joke.

Congrats, man.
Congrats! Weirdly, my dad wears the same shoes
From what I have surveyed at schools functions, this is pretty much the new grandpa uniform. The new ‚Äúdad uniform‚Äù is usually an under armor T-shirt, khaki cargo pants/shorts, no show socks, and under armor tennis shoes.
Congratulations, new papa!
The baby doesn't seem to approve... Haha
Congrats!
Recognize the Utes logo. Congrats to both of you. Welcome to fatherhood.
- another young father in Utah.
Congratulations you guys!
Congrats!  Unsolicited advice: make sure those mall-walkers are tied tight because 10.. then 20.. years are about to fly by.

Live in every moment, even the not so great ones. Actually, especially those.

And make sure that belt has some room for expansion üòâ
Awe shit he got the Dell Currys on
Can you give us a dad joke
looking good everyone! go mom!
That dad leg is poppin
You look like you could compete with Pittsburgh Dad.
You're so close, should be a tee shirt from a national or state park, not a button down.

Source: my dad
Your steely Dan records should be coming in the mail shortly.
Your family is beautiful.
I‚Äôm sorry but that baby looks like he‚Äôs not having it.
Grillmaster 5000s
Remember, white socks with your NB, black socks with your sandals. 
Love that part of dadding..
Um... those are not cargo shorts.
they're from utah baby
He seized the opportunity
Getchu a cell phone holster.
Everyone talking about NB being dad shoes forgets the ugliness that are deck shoes. Total dad shoe.
Your wife already looks like she's tired of your shit.
Congrats! Boy or girl? And now get ur filthy, hand-me-down dad shoes off the hospital bed, for crying-out-loud! What- were u raised by raccoons? (JK!)
Wow. Your wife looks like she comes back from an average hike.

Women are so strong it‚Äôs scary.

Cngratulations to you guys! Damn thats exciting!
She already looks 100% done with your shit.
she looks like she's on the edge to let so the hell lose.
Utah in a nutshell
OP, time to run out and buy a copy of of *What Color Is Your Minivan -* The new parents' guide to practical utility.
Your wife is such a good sport for allowing this. Either that or the delivery meds haven‚Äôt completely worn off yet. Either way, you‚Äôve got top notch woman right there.
Congratulations.!! That's a nice family picture.  You will look back at it years from now.

But those shoes on the bed and that too a hospital bed - Never, not in my house where you leave the shoes at the front door (inside).  Surprising nobody else mentioned that.
Congratulations!

God bless dads everywhere!  I remember my sister and I taunting our father when one summer day, he was out on the front lawn wearing shorts, white socks, and brown leather sandals.  He had a good sense of humor about it though!
I'll be a dad in a few weeks and I absolutely love this picture üòÑüòÑ
Robert Fripp?
I recognize that water cup! Congrats on the little one and bundle them up real good when you leave. It‚Äôs cold up there on the east bench.
I retired early to Fort Lauderdale and let me tell you, New Balance is the OFFICIAL SHOE  of the man over 50. 

Go to any resturant or social gathering and look down and you will see a sea of New Balance shoes. 

I love them, they make WIDE width shoes.
As a dad I‚Äôm here to tell you Crocs are amazingly comfortable. Don‚Äôt let anyone tell you they suck because they are like walking on clouds
Where are the jorts though?
Look at that proud King
dont worry. those are dad shoes.
I love those stand issue giant hospital water bottles
I‚Äôm 25 with two boys, 10 and 7. I‚Äôve gotten into the established career, clothes that are comfortable, dad joke, etc mindset. I‚Äôll be on discord one minute hearing someone talk about this drug or that concert, and then the next minute I‚Äôm playing beyblades. Get ready man, it‚Äôs gonna hit you in full force.
There should be a gofundme for him to get proper shoes and some longer socks.  Also needs a cell phone holster on his belt.  Still gets a perfect 10/10 dad uniform score.  Well done OP.
Congratulation on the harvest of your warm potato
You're dressed just like my own dad from 1990.
The fact that you even did this ensures your going to be a helluva dad have fun buddy. Mom looks like good sport to good luck to you both that‚Äôs a beautiful family .
You are a lucky man :D have a great family.
Oh god! I‚Äôm having nightmares from those first couple of days in the hospital after my son was born. Congrats and I hope y‚Äôall get plenty of rest (or at least try).
Been wearing ‚Äúdad‚Äù shoes since I was 16 as they were the only shoes readily available in my size. Miss wearing cooler shoes
Costco jeans incoming
Congrats! We just had a baby a few days ago in Provo!
No dad uniform is complete without dad jeans and dad jokes.
Yall are a lovely ass couple
Reminds me of when my family went on vacation and I dressed like a stereotypical tourist: unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt over a white T-shirt, tan shorts, almost knee-high socks, sunglasses, and a sun hat.
As a dad of a 8 month old and bonus dad of several older kids, what are dad shoes...
Those are dad shoes? Shit, I'm older than I thought. Actually, I might be older than you, I just haven't had any kids. Still never thought of those as dad shoes.
Can't tell if he's going to be a dad or start a drug trafficking ring.
Your wife looks great. I‚Äôd never have guessed she just gave birth. Tell her she looks beautiful even if she doesn‚Äôt feel like it atm.
I'm 14 and I wear new balance shoes...
Sandals! And maybe black socks wood complete the package
Only reason I own a pair of new balances is my doctor literally told me I had to, but I couldn't get white ones. 

Not until this photo will be taken for me at least 

You have to tuck in your t shirt to some cargo shorts. That's the ultimate power sign.
Hold on to that water bottle! My daughter is 3¬Ω and I still have that same bottle from the hospital. It's the best.
Yo new balances are great I‚Äôm not even a dad but they‚Äôre the only shoes I buy
Your wife looks AMAZING, please tell her so!
Fuck me I‚Äôm 20 and I wear new balance white tennis shoes every day
That‚Äôs a U of U cup, of course this happened here in Utah üòÇ
When my girlfriend was pregnant we went to the local mall to do some shopping. I needed a pair of shoes. She went and got her stuff and I went off to find shoes. I bought the quintessential dad shoe. Nike Monarchs. I was walking through the mall strutting my new dad shoes. I‚Äôll never forget the look on her face when she saw me. Go buy your shoes! You deserve them!
Hate to be "that guy" but you're missing a couple of stripes on your sports socks.
You tell her to hold onto that hospital cup. It's super convenient -- I spent 6 months in the hospital and fucking loved that thing.
You got Grandpa shoes instead.
Congrats. I‚Äôm currently sitting in the hospital awaiting our second.
Black dress socks would have made it perfect.
Honestly this is the most wholesome and wonderful thing I‚Äôve seen and I‚Äôm so happy for you and your family. May your journey into dadhood be the best it could ever be
Her face... ' I'm so glad you're finding this hilarious while I just pushed out A FRIGGING HUMAN BEING!!!'
Socks are at the appropriate height, welcome to the club
Cellphone holster is missing.
I oughta start a Dad's clothes and shoe subscription service.  It'll be called, "I've Got Better Things to Do".  For a low monthly payment, we will send a new pair of shoes every year, a new jeans, new khaki shorts and Hawaiian shirts every 2 years, the gradually increase the sizes without asking.  Every so often, we'll send out a really ugly shirt.  We'll call it the "That's Not the Shirt You Meant to Wear" wife's special.
To be honest new balance are great shoes haha, I have a 5 year old par that are now the yard work shoe basically but they have lasted so well. 

I also wear crocs thongs(flipflops) 80% of the time

I'm Australian so its allowed.
White new balance sneakers?! We got a dad over here, boys!! In all seriousness though, I hope for nothing but the best for your family in the future. Much love!
Welcome to the dad force.only army that was never defeated. Enjoy the miracle
OMG!! This is how my father really, actually dresses. EXACTLY! Same colour shorts. Hawaiian shirt and shoes and pulled up socks. My god.
Awesome pic! Congrats! About to be a dad soon myself, and I hope I'm 1/25th as cool as you are rocking those dad shoes (with complimentary pulled up socks I see)!
I love how white NewBalances are universally deemed as "the" dad shoes. Something about them really captures the dad essence
Lmfao, your kid even looks like it's laughing/recoiling from your terrible Dad joke aura.
Haha atta boy! Congratulations! And go Utes! I work at this hospital üòÇ
Khaki shorts are the shit, and I'm a childless man. But this is an amazing photo, and congratulations to you both!
Congrats man!  You have an awesome little family!
Quick, someone get this fella a fanny pack! Congratulations, man.
Way to make the birth of your child about you..
Welcome to the New Normal.
I wish you all the absolute best.
How wonderful, Congratulations!!  You have a very nice looking family.  Be sure not to stop wearing the outfits that the mother of your baby loves seeing you in.
Congrats!
Baby clearly approves the dad suit
That‚Äôs pretty unnecessarily corny
Good news is those are dad shoes
The New Balance is the icing on the cake.
Look at all that effort to make himself the center of attention on the day of his first born child's birth.
Bro my dad has the same exact pair of shoes!
Well done
You only have two available pockets to hold stuff so.....fail. Go get a fleece full zip up with pockets. I've had mine for 15 years and I just purchased a second one for my birthday.
This is such a dad joke
New Balance! What dads wear because they think it makes them look cool. You got the look right. Enjoy.
damn I knew I forgot to do something when my son was born.

&#x200B;

also congrats pops you're doing great
here‚Äôs one thing you need to know, girls don‚Äôt really like dad shoes. Just no. Yes, the answer is no. She was correct. Grateful she didn‚Äôt let you buy dad shoes :3 congrats
We are going to be good at this.
I swear every dad on the planet has those damn shoes. Some secret society shit üòÇ
Shoulda gone with cargo pants, but everything else is on point.
Bruh imagine first thing u do w ur new born baby is post it to reddit
The most dad part of this is the last part, ".. cause my wife wouldn't let me buy dad shoes"
Ha ha, dude totally got laid. *highfives*
Way to embrace it.
Excellent... embarrassing your child from day one!
I bet be is watching this post more then his actual newborn
Any walking he does now just got upped to speed walking lol
Welcome brother.
You‚Äôll unlock cargo shorts when you have 2 kids!
Dude I am wearing my ugly ass "old man shoes" which are comfy as fuck new balance. I have a bruised heel and they are the only shoes that feel good.
Oh utah ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
‚ÄúDad, take picture of me with my sex trophy‚Äù
Not sure if anyone else has told you but this was stolen by a malicious group on FB. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúNorth Carolina Breaking News‚Äù and they passed themselves off as you. (Unless you‚Äôre them but I doubt it.)
Way to make your wife‚Äôs day and new born child‚Äôs first day all about yourself, also risking dropping the baby because you had to make sure the shoes were in the picture. Thought it was sweet at first, then I really thought about it..
Reddit, the last bastion for milking out every bit of that feeling of attention.  Let life come and go freely, live in the moment and try not to capitalize on moments like these by thinking about those extra karma points.
Your wife is a trooper. She still has the energy to look slightly annoyed and amused after giving birth.
New balance are awesome shoes why would she have an issue with them.
University of Utah Hospital, I see. I work just up the road from there at the Huntsman Cancer Institute! Always fun to see something local on a random reddit thread.

May your child experience years of embarrassing moments at the hands of her father, and may your wife have the patience to roll her eyes like this for every incident.
I just sucked about a gallon of mucus out of my 4 month old's nose with a turkey baster. Welcome to the party, pal
Congratulations!!!!!üëè
Hope you enjoyed your last night of real sleep, you have 18 yrs of restless nights ahead of you. Congratulations.
Your wife needs more water. Her cup is almost empty.
Wow congrats to both of you. Your wife looks stunning ! 
I love your style ! 
I'm sure you're going to enjoy bringing kids to school as much as I do/did. My daughters, somehow, hate my 'special' outfit. Dunno why. Kids you know...
@ the U of U üôå
I was not aware that toddlers could have babies.
Looks like Utah, so that trip to the maternity ward maybe the first of many for you two
almost looks like the kid's already yelling 'DAD! STOP EMBARRASSING ME!'
We had our baby last week! I'm also in Utah but our daughter was delivered in Riverton. I'm told the U is really great though. No white new balances for me yet but we'll work them in!
Ugh. Babies are ugly
Your baby looks deformed
Are you Mormons?
Are you guys like 16 years old
I bought my husband New Balance sneakers for his first Father‚Äôs Day!
This is hilarious. My Dad has at least 3 pairs of those exact shoes. The only tennis shoes he‚Äôs worn in at least 20 years.

Congratulations! Your family is beautiful
The last time I seen a woman look that unimpressed, is right after we had sex.

Kudos to her for being a good sport.

Congratulations on the mini human.
oh that parenting would be as easy as putting on a uniform...
Love the wife‚Äôs forced smile and thumbs up
Nonono! You're supposed to look cool now, that look is for when they start to hate you!
Her face screams "I had kids with him?"
why are you guys so cute? I want what you have
Congratulations! Your woman looks incredible for just having a baby. 
Good luck!
This guy needs permission to buy shoes
10/10 on the dad uniform. You‚Äôre basically Steve Martin from Father of the Bride üëèüèº
It‚Äôs a joke until you realize cargo shorts and Hawaiian shirts are really comfortable.
Congrats! Love this! Your wife‚Äôs look really sells it. Can‚Äôt cross post but you should definitely share this with r/daddit. Also, gotta get some cargo pockets on them shorts.
Everything about this is adorable, from the kiddo to the proud papa to the tolerant mama to dad‚Äôs dad lending the perfect shoes to complete the perfect outfit for the perfect moment. This needs to go above the fireplace or something man. Cheers to you and your happy family.
Ah right, now your favorite stores are Lowe's and Home Depot. You also need to bore the wife with talk about how that R-12 insulation needs to be stapled while you can have the R-14 blown in.
Ha "she wouldn't let you" at the very least we know who's the bitch in this relationship.  Bahahaha
Welcome to fatherhood! I just joined the club yesterday myself. Congrats to you and Mom on such a sweet kid!
Thought they were playing Minecraft on the tv in the background for a minute.
Why though
Sorry for your loss.... Of money, free time, sleep, sanity, and humanity. But congrats on the new poop machine
Beautiful family! Congrats! Side note: Ask for clean bedding now that your dad shoe, which has been walking around on the hospital floor, has made contact with the bedding your SO and newborn are sharing. Not trying to be mean, it's just there are lots of bad germs in hospitals, even with the careful cleaning they do.
Look at you, out there rocking the dad look, from one dad to another, congratulations!
Is this in America? How much did the entire hospital visit cost?
Congratulations!
Welcome to the brotherhood of fatherhood. Congrats!
She honestly looks incredible for what she‚Äôs just been through.
She looks like a good sport, your wife.
Glad to see your wife has already mastered the "Mom" expression haha
You are a fucking idiot.
Birthing Wife: honey let‚Äôs go already!
Desperate funny guy: wait I just have to change my clothes real quick!
BF: It‚Äôs coming!!
DFG: ALLRIGHT JEEEZ I GUESS I DONT HAVE TIME TO LOOK FOR THE VISOR
Imagine craving this attention on you for fake internet points after your wife just birthed a child lol unbelievable
This does not belong in this sub.
‚ÄúHow can I make this about me?‚Äù
okay, but this is how my husband dressed before he even became a dad.
I'd wear that shirt in a minute
I'm a grown man and my dad still wears those exact shoes
Missing that fanny pack though.
Those aren't dad shoes.  They're granddad shoes
the bloody baron questlien has started
White new balances. I don‚Äôt get how these became standard issue. But it‚Äôs true lol
Don't forget the fanny pack!
Should've gotten some sandals with that look
Sandals with socks would have also been a good substitute. Congratulations
Now you just need to work on that dad bod
Wait, what's wrong with those shoes?  Also, Nike aren't cheap. If they were Walmart brand....
Your wife is a really smart woman. You don't buy dad shows, they just kinda show up.
You should also add faded blue jeans with those white new balance!!
She appears thrilled in your outfit choice.
I have those exact same shoes... except I‚Äôm 29 and don‚Äôt have any crotch goblins.
**Nice try.** Now...let's bump it up a notch so you're a winner: Velcro New Balance because easy and for extra points, grass stains. Next, please only wear calf or knee high dress black socks. For the shorts, cargo pockets are recommended and an off white color is standard. If at all possible, wear a camera around your neck and for the completion, a garage sale, sweat stained ball cap that has a logo that means absolutely nothing in your life. PS, cute baby.
You should have got away with buying all those things individually, without ever suggesting you might amalgamate them.
Adorable!
Your NewBalance show up around the same time you get your dad jokes.
You can always go for the ol'socks-n-sandals
Those aren't cargo shorts. You're going to have stuff. Those extra pockets will discreetly conceal the tape measure you'll need to bring with you every where you go. Your wallet, that is bulging with loyalty cards and coupons, that is giving you sharp back pains should fit nicely into those pockets. That baby is going to need stuff to keep him or her busy, toys will fit into those pockets. Extra diapers will fit in those pockets. The alternative is a fanny pack and I'm not sure you want to be one of those dads.
Is your dad Capt. Morgan?
Congratulations
Wheres your fanny pack? Lol

Congratulations!
Shoulda gone just mustache to tie it together
Next stop: mad dog t-shirts
Congrats. Now start practicing your dad jokes.
Let the dad jokes commence!!
You should thank your wife for not letting you buy "dad shoes," lol. And for the baby, too, I guess....
The trick to to buy dad shoes before you get the girl.
My dad has these shoes, is this a universal dad thing???
Disgusting, I love it. Congratulations. You ‚Äúsoon‚Äù to be teen is already embarrassed by you.
Congratulations to you all the
Damn ya really dad'd it up quick
Yay for dads!
Awesome! Good luck to you and your wife, having a kid isn't as easy as it sounds!
My buddy had his baby yesterday at the U of U hospital too. Congrats brotha!
Don‚Äôt lie. Those are YOUR shoes
Currently watching Sesame Street and wiping up a yogurt goatee off my 18 month old not seeing any irony in this well-dressed fella.
Congrats on fatherhood. It's a lot of fun, a lot of trial-and-error, and an insane amount of inexplicably illogical behavior.
Congratulations!!
It‚Äôs the odd phrases that creep in which get you.
She looks like a great sport with you dadding so hard from the start. 

Congrats on the beautiful bundle, and here‚Äôs to endless years of dad jokes!
 Her face says it all
heyyyyyy go utes
I assumed that dr scholl's were the new dad shoes. I‚Äôve been so wrong.
Impressive that there still are men around who take the dad role seriously and aren‚Äôt afraid to dress the part as well. Precious baby, congrats! Best wishes to you and you beautiful family!
Brilliantly done
When a parent puts more effort into the idea of telling jokes or what the kid‚Äôs name should be it means the kid is not going to have a well-rounded childhood.
Was 0% surprised at the U of U tumbler
TIL I learned I've been wearing Dad shoes since I was 8....I love New Balances!
Ive been wearing similar shoes since I was 9.
Your wife wouldn't let you buy shoes? Good luck with that.
My dad was fairly wealthy. He did fairly well in investments but was a chemical physicist by trade (super nerd). Despite all the money he had, he‚Äôd wear 25 year old turquoise pants ‚Äòbecause they still fit‚Äô and I loved him for that, for being an ultimate dad like that.
Haha!  Congratulations!  I‚Äôm laughing because I own those exact same ‚Äúdad shoes‚Äù.  Of course, I am a dad too.
Congratulations to your wife and you.
You forgot the visor.
Dad uniform or 90s science fiction movie costume?
Do you watch Cherdleys?
This is awesome! Welcome to the party, pal.
Your wife is such a trooper! Photo-op post birth hahaha
You look like you just got off shift at Trader Joe‚Äôs! Congrats, Dad!
Can‚Äôt help but notice you‚Äôre in Utah! Congrats to you and your wife. (I have my very own collection of U of U hospital mugs, lol!)
That‚Äôs a smart wife. You should marry her.
What kind of cargo are you supposed to carry with those puny pockets?  Pa-thetic!  

Seriously though, congrats!
Does your dad own a C5 Corvette? Because those are elder Corvette dad shoes
Nailed it!  Congrats to you both. 
That is possibly the most unenthusiastic thumbs up I‚Äôve ever seen.
Congratulations!
I feel attacked.
You are a dad now. Wifey cannot stop the purchase of a nice dependable shoe, that properly taken care of will last years. It‚Äôs a smart investment and will set a great example for the baby to smartly spend your money on something that can be dependable and long lasting.
Congratulations, on the baby. And welcome to fatherhood iron your Wranglers and grab the New Balance.
You look like a young Robert Fripp.
Congrats bro
Is she rocking a grateful dead tee? That's badass right there.
Haha I give it 3-5 months and she will care less about what shoes you wear. That's when you will reach your dad  shoe form. Hang in there :)
nah my dad has had those exact same shoes for literally as long as ive been alive. youre off to a great start my dude
This is utterly adorkable. I love it. Congratulations to you and your new family!  I hope momma‚Äôs recovering well!
This feels like a personal attack.
No cargo shorts...
I adore this photo üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
I was wearing new balances before I was a dad, and right after I was a dad.  Now I am wearing under armor in an attempt to "look cool" and embarrass my teenager.

It's not working, so I now need to move up to Chuck Taylor's or Vans.
Those aren't your dad shoes?
Those water bottles are legit. I got one for both of my sons when i was in the hospital and still use them. Legit
That looks like a vacation shirt.But yeh,your going on a vacation-caring about your new baby!!!
üíÅüíÅüíÅüëåüëåüëå
I dont get the NB hate. It was only comfortable sneaker 11 1/2 4E I could find at 25 and the only comfortable sneaker I can find today.
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with this.
Lmao
Just missing the braided belt. Otherwise, perfection.
Perfect! Those New balance are
Fire. You‚Äôre off to great start- let the adventure begin!
Congrats! Upvotes because my dad also has those shoesü§ô
Congrats to you both!
Ha ha A for effort
Is it true that little joke was $10k?
All you need now is a leather phone holster and a trifold wallet full of useless cards and receipts!
My partner unironically owns 3 pairs of NB. I say it's a pair for each kid. 

The white ones are for looking nice. The black ones are for day to day wear. The blue ones are for fun.
Congrats!

However,  from a Dad perspective those shorts are virtually pocketless.

Where you gone keep your waterproof matches or the extra wire nuts?
My children‚Äôs father has found cargo shorts to be the best dad shorts, if you‚Äôre looking for tips and tricks
Be the daring one, buy Monarchs
Perfect family ‚ù§Ô∏è congratulations!
Aloha shirt tucked in - nice attention to detail.

"He shall know your ways as if born to them."
What's dad shoes?  Loafers?
Fuck. You look just like my dad when he was holding me 30 years ago
Well congrats daddy-o!!!!! Healthy wishes to you and your new family!!! Hugs for the mama with her beautiful smile!!
[Insert Finding Nemo Scene] You're an inspiration to us all!
One enviable family you have OP. Wish you many more years of happiness.
University of utah eh? That's where my son was born 2 1/2 years ago! Congrats you guys!
99% there, need to upgrade to cargo shorts!
Congratulations
Thats so sweet but she looks like having cold feets
You‚Äôre going to find a New Balance in your life with fatherhood.

Congrats you two.
Isaiah?
Isn‚Äôt dad just grand. . . Ha . . Ha . . Ha . . .
*wouldn't let me*
Hit the savers on your way to foothill? Lol shouts out to the U for those big cups too, I still use that cup all the time 

Congratulations, be careful getting home with the fresh snow over the next couple days
Very funny.  But get your filthy shoes off the bed! BadDaddy!  Best of luck to your family.  Your wife is a wise and awesome woman.
Of course New Balance shoes are a must for the Dad outfit.
From the Nigel Thornberry collection, I see.
Those are dad shoes.
... TIL childless at 40 I dress like a dad....
Now you just need your Gs to be coming out of the bottom of your shorts to go for full dad effect.
May the puns be with you.
What was the first dad joke you made though?
You three are adorable.   Congratulations!
Your wife looks really good for just having a baby! Congrats, Dad :)
Hi, I'm gonna get you a set up for a classic dad joke!

Also, congrats!
I love this
Congratulations!
As you get older you will find comfort outweighs pride (at least pride for the superficial).  You will stand many hours on the sideline of a socker field while your lawn goes fallow.
That shirt is an attack on the eyes!

I approve it will draw much unwanted attention to you and thus make you "embarrassing" by your kids standards. 

Very good. Here is your dad badge.
You have been banned from /r/ENLIGHTENEDCENTRISM

You have been subscribed to /r/DadJokes
Looks good on ya. Also congrats to you and your  wife!
Dude you need to start preparing the Dad jokes! Make sure you never run out!
I love your wife‚Äôs expression.  There‚Äôs a ‚Äúwhat have I gotten myself into‚Äù vibe.
Let's hope your kid doesnt take fashion tips from you buuhahaa.
Buy yourself a pair of New Balances and Crocs immediately.  Your wife just needs to understand that you're a DAD NOW!
I‚Äôm guessing this is day 2 by the way mom looks. Prepare yourself for lack of sleep.
The best part is the wife‚Äôs look. The standard, ‚ÄúOh, this joke again face.‚Äù
Those are my dads shoes too
That's a good look my man.
>my wife wouldn‚Äôt let me buy dad shoes.

Just wait until summertime comes and you're by the grill wearing your mandals.

Congrats on the new addition!
I suspected this was Utah and I think the cup confirmed it lol
Bro those are the dad shoes. You didnt need to buy them.
Nice dad vacation shirt nerrrrrd!!
My dad also has those shoes.
You look like Robert Fripp.
My dad had the exact same pair.
They're not dad shoes until they have grass stains.
By the kid's reaction you must have told your first dad joke.
This is incredible! Already Dad of the Year!!!
congrats. and Mom‚Äôs shirt is pretty dope too
Congrats!
I absolutely fucking love people sometimes.
Happy for you. Congratulations! Sleep is precious. Get a mini van so you can sleep in lunch break in comfort. :)
She hates it. Perfect. Well done.
Needs more fanny pack...
Ah..New Balance, serving the dads since long time!
Replace the glasses with readers and cargo up those pockets. Congrats! Your life will never be the same (in a good way).
It's my birthday today too, this is so cute to see! I love the outfit haha
 Nice!

My fianc√© has some family members w/ awesome sense of humor - their Christmas cards are always hilarious - this could have been 1 of them 


Good luck to you both - mom looks like a champ !

‚ÄúYeah I just did that - whatcha got ?‚Äù
Congrats! And since you‚Äôre in Utah, you absolutely must start a stick figure family on the back of your minivan now!
One cute dad!
What the fuck is a dad shoe?
My son is being born at the end of April. I am 100% doing this!
Congratulations! My first daughter was born this past Friday. Unfortunately, I left my standard-issue NBs at the house.
Congratulations!! The greatest gift you can give as a dad is to love him and let him grow into his own personality and interests. It‚Äôs not easy being a parent but it‚Äôs beautiful.
Dad? Is that you?
> my wife wouldn't let me

Sounds like a dad to me.
Bravo bro!! Congratulations!!!
Dad or Trader Joe‚Äôs manager.
10 months in and my wife still wont let me. Congrats!
Make a happy wife and buy her some knock off (if you don‚Äôt have) yeti jug that has a nozzle on top. Sometimes it‚Äôs really hard to get ice in the hospital. Then again I‚Äôm a guy who has never been in the labor room and don‚Äôt know how often they are checking on her.
How exactly are those shoes "dad shoes" they're comfy as hell, and I see people all around me walk around in shoes like that since my mid teens. Just curious how they got defined as dad shoes.
Those are his ‚Äúgoing to the mall‚Äù shoes. 

Not green enough for lawn mowing shoes. Or if you‚Äôre like my dad, they‚Äôre not duct taped enough.
Wear the badge proudly
Haha New Balance dad mode engaged! Congratulations!
She looks *thrilled* with your bullshit üòÇüòÇ
University of Utah, congrats! We live in the same
City.
Holy shit that baby has a lot of hair
You are dadding so hard right now! Congrats man!
She's so impressed with you.
University of Utah?
Looks totally natural.
That shirt is pure magic

You got them Spongebob shorts lol
Congrats, now go get some grass stains on them New Balances
#dadkitted #dadkit

I hope we can be friends one day.
This would be perfect with a Captain Morgan rum barrel
Hilarious! Congrats you two on that sweet little baby!
r/dungeonsanddaddies
Congratulations pops! Can confirm dad also has those shoes.
It is nice when an incel breaks through congrats to you guys
Damn that baby is pissed at you.
Congrats, but everytime I see people in America having children, I just think of how much they are going to be charged by the hospital after watching this clip of how messed up the health are over there.
OMG Smell like Walmart's Jeans
That's great! Congratulations to all three of you!
u/Quentin_the_Quaint here sir, reporting for daddy!
Her face says it all.
The daddest of dads! Congratulations, OP! Cheers to a healthy child and wife!
Enjoy this moment.  It‚Äôs not going to be all about you for awhile.  I think your wife may already get it
dadcore
Welcome, fellow dad
My dad has that exact same pair of shoes in duplicate.
I imagine this scene in the shoe store:

Your wife: Are you in a frat?

You: What?

W: Are you in a frat?

Y: What? No. Of course not, you know that. 

W: Are you Steve Jobs?

Y: What?

W: Are you the billionaire founder of a major tech firm?

Y: No...

W: THEN YOU CAN‚ÄôT HAVE THESE FUCKING SHOES



https://youtu.be/Dk0roE34zLw
DAD UP! lol
Fun guy
Go Utah!
Congrats. You guys are gonna be amazing parents.
You kind of just look like any California hipster.
Dad shoes are actually now fully in style in the street wear community. I rock dad shoes all day every day.
Buy the shoes you want king
Good mindset. I like how you are accepting your new role in this new phase of your life. Bravo.
Minus the shoes and socks this is too close to home and I have no wife or kids
Have to start practicing your Dad jokes!
Hope you keep that enthusiasm in a few days lol.
DAD 100

Take care of the wife and baby they are number one forget the other stuff . 
Good luck and good health to you enjoy!‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
It‚Äôs really kinda getting to me in a real bad way the fact that I‚Äôm seeing married couples with kids years younger than me at this point.

I really wish I could find a wife and start a family but it just isn‚Äôt ever going to happen...
You guys look like 20 years old
r/daddit ... One of us, one of us
Bro I got that same outfit... I hope I‚Äôm not a dad ‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢...
Congratulations to you and your family brother
I promise I mean this as a compliment to you and your wife‚Äôs youthful good looks when I say: ‚ÄúWho let these two babies have a baby?!‚Äù

Congrats on the new addition!
Go Utes! Welcome to fatherhood!
He's ready.
