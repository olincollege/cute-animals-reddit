"I'mjustsogladyou'retalkingtomeeee"
It's such a sweet smile
This picture reminded me of a couple I'm friends with. Once in college, I was hanging out with them in the guy's dorm and he was talking very excitedly about what he was learning in his neuroscience course. He then stopped and asked her "Is any of this making sense to you?" and she said "No, but I admire how much you know and I like listening to that."

They got married last September.
"That blah blah blah blah rhythm is so soothing."
She's got one of those noses you have to BOOP!
That sweet smile though..
I share my day with my doggo all the time, she just let me pet her then licks my hands. Warms my cold dying heart
Ohmygod the way she's looking at you!! Awwwww
I bet this would fit well in /r/DogsMirin
My heart has never felt so full ❤️🐶
May I pet her?
Unconditional love
me when i still didn't hear what he said after asking him to repeat it for the 3rd time...
I love that look so much!  “Really?  And then what happened?  I don’t understand but I love the sound of your voice.”
Very good girl. 🥰❤️
What a lovely smirk!
 Can’t handle those toe floofs. Toe floofs forever.
She understands
Adorable.
I need a schnoodle poem for this smile. What a good girl
Okay, I don't want to appear hyperbolic, but... I think I'm in love with your doggy.
She’s just pretending to not understand...
I love her smile ❤️
Me when my boyfriend starts talking about trains or grilling.
u/pet_disneyfication
She looks like a grandmother who doesn't quite comprehend what her grandchild is explaining, but loves them and there enthusiasm anyway xD

"Oh really dear? Very interesting!..... Would you like some more cookies?"
r/nataliedogmer
holy shit thats a lot of upvote
Dont know what you are saying but I love you so much...
That is one charming dog
Such an adorable pooch - from her bright eyes and crooked smile to her delicate wrists and fluffy paws.  <3  She will always and forever be your biggest fan.
She understands
!!!!!!!
Goddamn this dog is cute.
Adorable doofus!

That smile. 😍😍😍
Awww your fur baby is so cute love the smile 😁
Heckin cute expression.  Melted my heart
Thats defiantly a sarcastic smirk
This photo makes me so happy! And your dog; oh my god. So adorable.
Me and my SO talking to each other about what we did at work.
My dog is just so excited that I’m talking to her that her ears go back, her tail is wagging, and her eyes are clearly saying “Is this about treats?”

[Found a picture of it!](https://i.imgur.com/NQVFxQl.jpg)
My golden gives me the same awkward look everytime I tell her something longer than 2 sentences 😅
[deleted]
There once was a puppy who was adorable. she would always get the best treats.
Is there a dogsmirin' sub?
"So me and the boys were all in game and one said where we droppin and...."
I don't know about y'all, but puppy smiles are one of my favorite things ever!
Here’s my gold to you. Make sure to share it with her! ☺️

🏅 🎖 🥇
Holy shite it my dog looks just like her
That's a good girl right there!
Maybe you're not as good a story-teller as you could be.

Maybe that look isn't "What?"

Maybe it's "No No I get it."
So trueee.....
I swear dogs evolve to have more human-like expressions with every passing generation.
This meme couldn't be any more perfect for my gf
My dog looks like that when he is about to puke.
I miss my old friend :(
Me everyday 😂
Okay doggo is cute and all but is no one going to mention that creepy ass face under the blanket?
I've got this exact sofa and flooring. Used your photo to trick my girlfriend into thinking I'd got her a dog. Wish we could get one.
I practice my stand-up comedy in front of my dog. He doesn't know a damn thing of what I'm talking about but he's helped in his own way.
Me when my boyfriend explains anything
I can't ... Is so adorable
Aw so pretty
That is the most photogenic dog I have ever seen. Beautiful.
she looks like she understands and is clearly judging you for it.
Aww
I love your energy!(wiggles butt)
Any man telling his girlfriend about a video game or sport.
she's cringing at you
[deleted]
She looks like she’s so interested in what you have to say
When your dogs having a stronk
Such a pretty doggo! What breed is she?
He abouta sneeze run!
They’re care givers!!
Adorable. Also it's probably just the slight head tilt but it looks like her other eye is a lot lower than the other
Just only simply that she loves you
Me when the Mr gets home.
Oh, some will say, she understands every single word and just how much you love her :)
Clearly unimpressed.
So cute
Me talking about audio stuff to normal people
What a sweet dog.
Me while my bf describes his Apex win.

Such a cute smile. Id talk to her all day!
I want a dog so bad!! 😭
I recognize that look! Have worked hard for it myself after many a hard day at work.
My bf will go on Total War: Three Kingdoms rants at least twice a day. I just like hearing how excited he is about it.
Aw
That's my face when I listen to ASMR GFEnor anything from r/pillowtalkaudio.



^(Yes, that is sad.)
Another proof of climate change: My heart just melted.
That smile made my day!
She has heard you tell this several times already...my wife gives me the same look
Beautiful dog
Literally my grandma when I tell her about my paper on the role of language in Searle's theory about institutional facts
I feel this.
❤️❤️❤️
Cute
That smile 😍
She did a crime against humanity today
For some reason this reminded me of Ron Weasley from Harry Potter
Can't stop whatching this smile...
“Heeey, what was in those SCOOBY snacks?”
Be careful: It looks like she has a Hemalurgic spike in her front. Who knows what kind of powers she's stolen and is hiding behind that crazy adorable face
I sing to my puppy girl.  And when she is out of the room and I start singing, she runs to me with her tail wiggling the dog....it’s so cute!!!!
And you love her anyway.
She has an angelic look... That adorable smile. Awwwwww.... *wanna pet*

u/littledickbigballs reminded me of Summer smiling at the camera. :)
Oh, I love this precious pooch! That face just melted my heart! Thanks for sharing!
This is like the smirk emoji in dog form. But in the best way possible
It be like that
Her smile makes me melt. Hug her for meeee!
Dogs understand a lot more than they are generally given credit for, but even when they don't they are good listeners.

&#x200B;

Yours is absolutely adorable.
I really need to get a dog.
D'aww :D
This dog is hella cute
Such a sweetheart
Adorable, does she have a name ?
Yeh!bcz of innocent
It's like she's doing a smirk but still judging you lol
*smirsk
Me when my bf talks about video games
Omg omg omg That dog is sooooo cute!!!
So cute and comprehensive I'm dying right now
I just recently had my roommate move out and it’s the first time in 8 years I’ve lived alone. I’ve taken up having full on conversations with my dog and the way he looks at me and reacts during a long ramble just makes me smile so hard.
What modle dog is this!? Adorable! Golden?!
Wut
Drew Barkymore
Omgomgomgomgomgomg
The secret to a happy marriage or if you're not paying attention = smile and nod
They don't know what you're saying, but they know how you feel.
PERFECT caption
You know why? Cause the bitch literally thinks you’re saying other things.
Beautiful baby.  🧡
The best listeners is the world😍
Nose looks like a pigs nose
That's my baby cousin last night lol! I told him the big dipper and little dipper stars were for the moon and sun to eat cereal out of the Milky Way. He just smiled and babbled something only a four year old could babble.
That face 😍
“Hey pal, that’s great. I’m happy for you.”
Dogo: that's total 🐂  💩  🤦🏿‍♂️
Why does this dog look like Wynona Rider
I really want a gf like that😁😁😍
This is so freakin' cute! 😊💛🐶👍
What an innocent little angel. Dogs teach me to be a better person. I see they never judge me no matter what i do and i dont have to feel like im gonna be judged around them and it teaches me not to judge anyone either. Dunno if anyone else feels the same way.
If that aint me 😂 also love the puppers 💕💕
I want to hug her so much. Such a cutie
This is a story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down...
#relatable
Cuteness
😍😍😍
Wholesome content. 14/10 would like to see more.
Thats my girlfriend when i start talking while drunk...
She gotz Dr. Seuss paws lolz ♥️🐾
"That's lovely, Greg. Tell me more."

Beautiful fur baby
Wish my life was this good, sofa, dog, and all.
"....... And this is how she lost all interest in me. And to this day I'm still single.  "

" *woof* "

"Awwwwwww"
.
“You’re not as funny as you think you are but I’m gonna smile anyways so you don’t feel bad.”
This is how my girlfriend looks at me when I talk about work.
Awwwwwwwww
That smug face tho
This is literally where they got the phrase 'sugar & spice & everything nice.' Shes sooo sweeeeet! :D
Hey, that's a cool story.
[What the fuck did he just say?]
I mean this is literally everyone i talk to. They listen to me but are too nice to say they don't understand.
"Sven we had a great adventure it was epic you should've been there!"
She looks like she doesn't care what you say at all, she just loves that your hers and she's yours.
The side smirk got me
I am interested to hear the story you told her. 
Did it have anything to do with dogs, cats or treats?
"give me a biscuit plz"
This is why dogs are the best!
>When you tell her a story that she doesn't understand

Made me think of [this](https://youtu.be/W_rNhdDOXMU).
The same look my momma gives me when I tell her about my research thesis project 😍
This is my girlfriend every time I talk jiu jitsu with her
😏
That happy smiling doggo has just made my day!! Thanks!
Seems like you're everything to her, that look on her facev😁😁
Her face says 'I've got a keeper here'.
She wuvs you so much, you're a lucky caretaker!
Love the little curls coming off the paws lol
cute af and that caption is perfect
Omg she’s got a face like: 
“Mhm! Awesome! Yes! Great! I love you!!” 

So so precious 💕💕💕
Look how happy she is
"Hmmmm. Yeaaahhh...I would've probably made the storyline a little more linear and had a big close, but you're adorable when you try to be interesting."
I get this from both my dogs and my baby now.
I want to hug her when she smiles like that
She kind of understands at least part of it, tho.
Mona Lisa dog smile
That smile says "whatever you say buddy"
I am puppers gib me wubs
Smug doggie
r/dogsmirin
That smirk that doggo makes is precious
She ain’t believing one word of this story
Pretty pup.
Penny Penny Penny Penny
Such nice manners
Is this a Golden retriever?
What a sweetie!!!!!
from this angle it looks like shes smirking and i love that
I would probably die for this dog

Don’t tell my dog I said that
This is my face a lot.
Aw that face.....♥️♥️♥️♥️
That's the look of a dog who is just smiling because of the silly things her human wants to tell her - while she was just in the middle of calculating the seven fractal dimensions of a quantum dynamics equation for cold fusion.

Yeah, now I can't unsee that either.
Damn. My head tells me that smile isn't what our human brain makes it to be, but my heart screams: "THAT PUPPY IS SO CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE" And I can't hear my brain over that noise.

Amazing pupper. I love her.
My gf when I'm giving her those intimate sports details.
U/oddblob3000
The pupper!!!
I am sure that she DOES understand!
Sounds like my wife
Those hairy paws!
Ok hooman you read me story. I then lick your face repeatedly.

You get up and you see I destroyed that evil teddy bear that sleeps with you. I way tail. You forgive me because you left bedroom door open.

Hooman gets tired goes to bed. I talked place of that evil teddy bear. You put arm on me. I promise not to breathe at you. All is good.

That fake story was good, but mine is better.
She appreciates the quality time you spent with her!
That is the goodest of girls
Find your someone that looks at you the way this dog looks at its owner 🥰
She's like, "Sorry, I don't understand first world problems. But I love you unconditionally, even when other people leave you alone while rolling their eyes."
Best listener
me whenever my man talks about MMA
She understands better than we know.
Oh! Look at that cute smile!
Me when my husband tells me about his day.
Oh my. That has got to be the cutest doggy smile I've ever seen!
idk how but she looks like Ryan Reynolds.
Oh she’s so cute. Aren’t dogs amazing?❤️
That little side smirk 🥰💖
Aww
Yep oh, totally hypnotized by the smile and the eyes. if she did that to me I would probably be feeding her filet mignon every night. LOL
Listening intently for anything that sounds like “treat” or “walkies”
"I love you hooman"
"Please, tell me more."
Idk how people can say dogs dont REALLY smile when you got goofy grinning dogs like this
Exactly how I look at my SO whilst he’s explaining a game to me
*walks up to dog* "so, you would NOT believe the day I had today, I was going to the store, right, and there was another..."
Frame this picture ASAP!!
That's grandma energy
This is the face I make when I ask someone to repeat something 3 times and still didn't hear what they said
What a precious angel. 🐕❤
And she want to tell you: I don't need story I need you
❤️
Ohhhh my God I'm so in love with her!
She looks like she’s trying not to laugh at you
“Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise?”
I want to smooch that dog so much (I don't even love bigger dogs)
I love 💛💛💛
She’s so cute. I can’t. Oh my god she’s so cute.
I feel like this about my abuelos
I thought this was going to be about my mother

This dog looks like Winona Ryder
Probably the most adorable thing on the interweb
She’s perfect!!
We don’t deserve dogs. Best creatures ever. ❤️
u/stmeem29 😍
It looks like there’s a nail sticking right through her chest, I hope it’s just a weird kind of collar. And obviously the face is funny.
10/10 Title game

Running

[deleted]
That is totally starry-eyed love!  

Once in a great while my cat looks at me like that.  It's rare, it's kind of like spotting a unicorn, but it happens.
Me with my girlfriend from China.
Remember, your dog is just one part of your life. But you are your dog's entire world. Do not take that responsibility lightly.
I don't understand this.
