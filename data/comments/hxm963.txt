That little butt wiggle just before he launches out!
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl
That fishbowl really hampers his ability to wiggle his butt before pouncing on the ball.
This is too precious!! Also, fellow moose!!
Bonsai Kitten!
He just wants to be a hermit cat.

Too cute! Kitty is going to be SO disappointed when it get too big for the fish bowl!
He's gonna need an upgrade bowl once he gets bigger. Like a hermit crab.
What kind of camera did you use for this?

This kind of thing is why I love cats, they are all little floofy weirdos.
[Steffon voice] This video has everything. Cat in a confined space, teefies, wide eyes, tail chasing, curled paws, ear twitch, butt wiggle.

Just wait till it discovers cardboard boxes... Cut a hatch in it and your kitty will play for hours.
Cats, and especially kittens, are weird little aliens and you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise.
God I love how weird cats are. At first I was worried that he was stuck and then I realized ‚Äúbastard is in complete control.‚Äù
I know there is a fish in here somewhere..
It *was* a fishbowl
If he fits he sits!
Wait till the kitten is now a cat and tries to get in or worse, tries to get back out of the same fishbowlüòÇü§£üòÇ
All that time they weren't after the fish, they were after the bowl!

He'll be so sad when he's too big to fit. You better plan on upgrading the size.

Enjoy it whilst you can little kitten. Before too long you will become a cat and the wonder of the fishbowl will be lost forever.

That's no cat that's a hermit crab
There's no way that's a fishbowl due to the size. It's a jar or something.

This is like movie quality the frick ! Cute Cat though !
Off camera to the left, Bob the gold fish is less amused.
I‚Äôm afraid for when the little guy is just small enough to fit, but big enough to get stuck...

There really is no point in purchasing expensive cat toys/houses when they are entertained by things like... a bowl
Cookie jar.

Is that not a cookie jar?

This just triggered some claustrophobia I didn‚Äôt know I had.

Amazing that my worst nightmare is this cat‚Äôs best day ever
That bowl is way too small for that cat. He/she needs at least a 10 gallon with proper filtration.
wait thats suposeed to be a fihbowl ????  Its literally too small for everything to live in there. Pls tell me that you wont put any fish in it. 

There is not enough space for water to dilute any amount of fish/shrimp poop so it doesnt burn the gills
It looks very uncomfortable but yet I'm not a cat
Imagine putting a lid on it lmao

This is giving me bonsai kitten PTSD. Legit thought it was real when I was a kid
Does anyone else remember early 2000s internet when people were convinced cats where growing in glass boxes to make them square?
Thank you for showing that he can easily get out. I thought he might have to live out his life as a fish.
Such an energetic turtle omg!
you need to become the enemy to defeat the enemy
Kinda wished they throw the toy inside the fishbowl.

Anyone reminded of the Bonzai Kitten website?
Adorable!
he's the fish now
Do animals ever get stuck in stuff like this?
It's going to outgrow it eventually and won't realize until too late.
I like that at the end, we get to witness the hermit-cat go out in search of a new, larger home.

Bonsai Kittens!
Ah it's a Kitten Hermit Crab in it's natural habitat. When the kitten grows too large for the fishbowl, it will then molt and move into a larger container. That's how Hermit Cat do.
Yeah kitten is cute and fun. But soon to be asshole

That's the only animal that's appropriate for that size tank. Absolutely no fish can live ethically in a tank that size.
I'm trying to think of the equivalent structure size for a human. Im guessing the clear circular tube thing in McDonald's play areas
Everyone in this thread thinks this is super cute...

Can I please recommend not allowing your cat to this. Cats of this age grow daily pretty much, so one day soon you're doing to find that your kitten is able to get in, but not get out. That won't be fun for anyone.

Edit: Downvote me all you like, it doesn't change the truth of what I said.

Anyone reading this PLEASE don't let your cat do this. I give a shit about animals, check my post history. I worked with animals for years and have a degree in animal management. I dont give a fuck about karma, I give a fuck about animals.
