I was not expecting the second and third kittens. What a pleasant surprise. 
I wish I had such shrubbery in my yard!

"DONT GO INTO THE TALL GRASS!"

Edit: my most popular comment was a Jurassic Park: the Lost World reference misconstrued as a Pokemon reference... Can't complain, honestly
Here be monsters and all kinds of savage beasts. Enter at your own peril.
When can IÔ∏è purchase one of these Cat Bushes?
I imagine this is how Pok√©mon attack. 
Where do I find the seeds to plant this Kitty Bush?!?!
1! 2! 3 kittens! Ah. Ah. Ah.
Awww it‚Äôs infested!...With cuteness!!
If anything were to ever come out of a bush and scare me, I would want it to be like this. Such cuteness!
*"Honey, can you call the yard guy early this week... The bushes are getting bitey."*
I'm definitely not saying to whack those adorable kitties with a mallet but my first thought was whack-a-mole
/r/fortniteBR is leaking
The dreaded bush sharks.

It‚Äôs a bumper crop of kittens this year!
I read the title in archers "danger zone" voice. Nice gif. 
My grandma use to have the perfect saying for this moment.. ‚ÄúThree cats in a bush is better than one in hand.‚Äù 

True story.

These kittens are gonna be the dominating the neighborhood parks when they grow up.
When I saw this video on Facebook, it was mentioned that these are the cats at Disneyland.

So cute üò±

Quick as a kitten 
"Shh, there's a clowder of kittens in this bush, and they're wound up on zoomies!"
These cats would be really good at Fortnite.
The kittens are also ripe for harvesting 
[This is getting out of hand...] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD_ag67tH3I)
Something about this makes me think of Fortnite
This is a catnip bush!
Great hiding place.
It‚Äôs like reverse whack-a-mole
A bush that keeps on giving. 
Adorabush! 
This is awesome 
Cute overload
How does one grow a bush that produces kittens?
They wil be good at fortnight
I want said danger bush. Do they sell these at Home Depot. I will plant it near my dogwood tree. 
A cat in the hand is worth two in the bush. 
This was so cute 
fortniteBr in a nutshell right now
My ex had a very dangerous bush
Omg there's 2 of them....OH MY GOD THERE'S 3!!!!
Oh my god they are so cute.
can't you see the poor cats don't want you to mess with their home's ceiling
Also an appropriate name for both of the presidents by this name 
The cuteness is almost too much. It's making my face feel weird.
Awwwwwww lil kitty
Hey that‚Äôs a cute cat

Nature never ceases to amaze, what a weird defence system for a plant.
Quite possibly the best gif I‚Äôve ever seen
That man needs to harvest those kittens before the first hard frost. 
I was hoping it was kittens.

A kitto!
Aw the last one reminds me of my cat when she wasn't old as dirt
Any poor bird that lands on that bush is FUCKED...
Im delighted to know there are no less than three dangers in that bush. 
If anything were to ever come out of a league game where rengar was fed to SEE THIS
This is referred to as the mythical ‚ÄúJesus Cat‚Äù. This is the name because when you‚Äôre walking along and one of these jump out you yell ‚ÄúJesus!‚Äù, hence Jesus cat.
Love the title.

Pssst psst kid... have some catnip?
Dangerously adorable
Awwwww! Adorable! :D
Gave me the biggest smile this morning. 
Hiya!
Prepare for trouble!

Make it double!

Meowth! That's right!
Well, perhaps poking the bushes agitated them, hence the danger response? Not saying that I wouldn't poke them, all the time...
Bushes is where the stork drops off kittens 
I want a Danger Bush!!
Cutest way to lose a finger!
so cute:)

I knew you could grow your own kittens. Such a rare botanical specimen. 
I was hoping for a third one!
üòÇüòÇüòÇ So cute!
The first trailer for the new Jurassic Park movie. 
Where did you get this wonderful plant? I need to know. 
Thank you, I‚Äôm about to go to bed and this has just righted all the wrongs of the day.
I don't understand, what are they doing there? üòÇ
to play with cats, you have to pretend like you‚Äôre something they can kill. 
Scared the shit out of me when it first shot out
This game looks like fun. I would pay real moneyz to play!!
Water your cat bushes daily. This is the optimal feline forestry outcome. 
Happened once in college...
Aw neat. The Kitten Bushes are in bloom!
Peek a bush
Where do I get kitten seeds?
Woah, that bush *is* dangerous...
I didn't look at what sub this post was on and imagined a swarm of hornets coming out of the "Danger bush."
Awwwwwww
So cute until you realise they're waiting for birds to murder. Then just kinda cute
I would have said that trim I got in Haiti was the danger bush
They must have awful fleas 
So if you're going to repost someone else's content and straight steal their title, how about at least [crediting the source](http://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/6o4e9d/danger_bush/)?
Every damn time I try to tickle a bush...
You know how fast id snatch them into my home?
I was waiting for Sean Spicer to jump out at the end.
I was expecting a tiny danger noodle. I'm only mildly disappointed. 
Now my phone has forcibly been made obsolete 
Three kittens in a bush is worth many scratches on your hands...
*flings my entire body into the bushes*
It's like reverse whack-a-mole.
Cuteness overload 
I saw this on my homepage and didn't realize that it came from /r/aww. Was expecting resurrection fern, but pleasantly surprised.
I think if i sprinkled some cat food on a bush like this at my place i would end up with a scarier danger bush
There must be like 30 of them! Entire cat civilization hidden in the bush!
I wish all bushes could be danger bushes
KILL IT KILL IT! #THECHINESEWERERIGHT

Predatory instincts.
I flinched when the cat came out.
r/HitMAnimals
It‚Äôs all danger bush. Never get out of the boat. 
Gosh how many dangers does that bush hold? A different one popped out each time!
This is essentially a game of whack-a-mole. Only with cats. And I don't want to whack them but take them all home and love them.
Teehee
I have a feeling she is looking for the third kitten.
r/Hitmanimals 
I would do this until they stopped.  The first was the best because you aren‚Äôt sure what is will be.

Dangerously cute.

I squeee inside every time I see this gif.
Indeed. Java sucks. C master race.
How many cats are in there?? Haha

That was so exciting; they just kept coming! I surely thought it would only be two little kitties, but then!

Who needs moats and knights and trapdoors when you‚Äôve got your own organic, all natural hedge of predatory beasts?
I thought you were trying to trick me into rewatching it over and over then I realised 1st and 3rd were different.

So so cute! When I was little we used to have kittens that played in the bushes too - super cute!
Cute!
I see you like to play with danger.
Pet-a-Puss. This is the less dangerous feline equivalency to Whack-a-Mole. 
Haha 2little cute Cat üòòüòòüòò
I thought it was going to be spiders.
hehehheehehhhehe aww ehheheheheheh
Is that 3 kittens in a bush or just 2? Either way - thats a nice bush
This video gives me life 
/r/thecatdimension

A kitten in hand is worth *three* in the bush? Accounting for inflation, of course.
A man filmed his last moments...
good to see
The cats are defending their homelands
This is why cats are evil
Haha -_-
Took me two and a half watch-throughs to confirm that, indeed, the first and last kittens are two different kittens.
Those cats really ambushed him.

The harvest is bountiful this season.

How many can be in there?? haha
Was this filmed vertically?
Coulda sworn I saw this posted in the Disneyland subreddit a few months ago. Said it was in the Fantasyland Bushes? Tomorrowland? I can‚Äôt remember.

Reminds me of ‚ÄòOver the Hedge‚Äô
Like something out of a horror movie.
Now I have to know, exactly how many kittens are in this bush?
I saw something super similar to this in Paris outside of Notre Dame. There are yards and yards of these bushed and if you tap on them or leave good little animals come out but they're rats. So many rats.
