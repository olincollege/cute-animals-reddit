It must feel so nice to be enveloped in warmth sitting in a hand. Like discovering an electric blanket for the first time. 
Well I hope you're content with only using one hand for the rest of your life.
Can you give an update?

Edit. Are you texting now left handed?
I see you found my boomerang bird. 
That’s one kickass yo-yo. 
"Oops, you almost dropped me"... *snuggles back in* "Whoops almost happened again,someone is clumsy today" *Snuggles even tighter*
This is the physical embodyment of "If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they're yours; if they don't they never were"
That's worth 2 in the bush.
you are a disney princess now
Probably a predator in the area the bird has seen.

“Dude, chill out. Just hang on a se.... DUDE. STOP.”
Op, what did you do to that bird to earn such trust? Did you rescue it, feed it daily, what?
[don't disown me papa](https://i.imgur.com/NagWixW.jpg) I made a sketch.
I love how it burrows in and gets all snuggled up! So cute
Make birdie a home 
How’d you get it onto your hand in the first place?
The hand is the birds nest, safe spot.
We found and raised a similiar looking bird like this one. She lived 9 years. Her name was "Nut" and she always did the same thing like in the gif. 

I miss her...
This is a college graduate looking for a job in this economy, and the parents trying to get them to move out into their own apartment...
The downside of being a disney princess: Not being able to wipe your butt because the bird won't stay out of your hand.
I just checked if there was a r/DisneyPrincess

There is, but unfortunately it is not a sub dedicated to people with Birbs perched on their hands. 
I don't blame him, those hands look buttery as fuck 
The bird is trying to snuggle but the stupid human keeps tossing it
My best guess is that this is a [Eurasian Tree Sparrow](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Eurasian_Tree_Sparrow/id) being used in a "merit release," which is an ancient Buddhist practice in Asia. Small birds like sparrows and finches are sold at temples, where people can buy them in order to set them free. It is believed that setting the birds free is a meritorious act bringing good karma.

The problem is that the birds used for merit releases are usually so tame, or weakened from capture, that they don't survive very long in the wild. It's not unheard of for the birds to fly back to the seller after being "released" because they see it as their home/food source. Perhaps that's what's happening with this bird. [The practice also has serious animal welfare and conservation implications](https://www.buddhistdoor.net/features/rethinking-life-release) since the birds are often captured from the wild or non-native species are released into the ecosystem.

>*Amid all the rejoicing, few are aware that their meritorious deeds are the cause of much suffering to the animals through the process of capture and confinement, and even after release. Animals that are captured in the wild can sustain extensive injuries from nets and traps. In transit, they suffocate or starve in tightly packed crates—sometimes for weeks—while awaiting release. And upon release, many suffer a slow and painful death from exhaustion, illness, or injury, or become easy targets for predators. For example, a study that used radio-telemetry to determine the survival of bulbuls and sparrows purchased from “merit sellers” in Hong Kong found that 6 out of 12 birds died within 3 hours to 10 days of release (hub.hku.hk). Further, animals that are bred to be sold for “life release” become traumatized when released in the wild, unable to cope with their new surroundings. Of the millions of animals released each year only a fraction survive, and some are even recaptured to be sold and released once again. Mass life releases also wreak havoc on the ecology in many areas, prompting the US-based Society for Conservation Biology to issue a statement to religious institutions in 2013: “The manner in which ‘animal release’ is currently practiced raises concerns for biodiversity and ecological integrity that negate the ritual’s actual aim of compassion. ‘Animal release’ causes several adverse effects on biodiversity including the spread of invasive species, genetic swamping, extreme animal suffering, competition, vulnerability to predation, disease, and human health concerns . . . [T]he religious practice of ‘animal release’ poses risk to the future of biodiversity in Asia and other parts of the world where currently practiced.”*
Birdie don't wanna leave 🤗
"Why is my nest throwing me?"
If it fits 


I sits
With such an impeccable sense of finding the way back home, the little guy could become a delivery birb some day. Homing sparrows FTW!
How does one unlock this Snow White level
It’s like a bird boomerang 
"The world be skeery. Let's look around a bit more together."
You are now mommy, congratulations.
"i will not let go"

\*bird shits in hand\*

"im letting go, fuck this"
I did not give you permission to use this video of me trying to get out of bed in the morning. Expect a call from my lawyers. 
plot twist, different bird coming back every time
"If you love something, let it go. If it comes back, keep it. If it does't, it was never yours." -someone wiser than me
I iz a birb

who make gud fren

try to tro?

You have a new pet! 🕊
Nature's snuggling Boomerang
I got a call from my aunt about a bird that got attacked by a cat and the neighbor kids saved it. It was a young robin, in shock, it’s leg hurt a little bit nothing terrible, so I took it out it in a shoe box with the top cut out, it was raining so I made sure he wouldn’t get wet, made it a little nest in there, gave it water and food and the little cutie enjoyed sitting in my hand during it all. Well I woke up and remembered the little bird after seeing this post, ran up to go check on it, and it was still in the box. I (for some stupid reason) tried asking it to step up like pet birds would, and it gave me a look and jumped on my hand (for a fraction of a second I thought it loved me like this little bird loved that hand) and flew away like it couldn’t get out there quick enough. It’s been sitting on a tree branch watching me for about 10 minutes now. [Part of me wants to think it’s thankful](https://imgur.com/gallery/6HUYyYQ) but the other part wants to make sure it’s stays afraid of humans. Made me happy it can fly again though. 

Edit words
If you hold him for 15 seconds your legally allowed to keep him.
There was probably a predator around 
Coolest yo-yo. Ever
Just fucking keep him!
What would cause a bird to do this?
You are now Bastion.
Awesome! My pet finches don't even do that :(
A bird in the hand is a penny earned.
A bird in the hand is worth two that you could throw.
That’s just super sweet ☺️
"Hey, that was fun, weee! Do it again!"
Tried this with my hamster but he didn't fly back. 
You just have to keep it forever at this point
I just held me hand over my mouth and whispered "oh my god, aww" 12 times like a heartstruck girly-girl, this is so adorable :c
It's birderang.
Cuteness overload.
Snuggle hands McGee 
That's worth two in the bush!
You’re some kinda Disney princess!
birb.
Aww the way it nestled back into your hand. 
That nuzzle at the end nearly killed me, holy shit
I read somewhere small animals would do this if there are predictors around. maybe there is a hawk circling waiting for it to leave the human 
I've heard of playing fetch with animals but this is not what I thought it was
Cool boomerang
Let it gooo  

*record scratch*

let it gooo

*record scratch*
If you love someone set them free. If they come back they’re yours forever
This video is truly amazing! My heart is melting as I watch it over and over again. That little bird has put a lot of trust in you and seems to enjoy your company very much. After that, I don't think I'd be able to let it go especially snuggling in your hand like that. 
You are now a Disney princess!
I like to imagine that this isn’t just one bird, but a whole bunch of birds in queue that are taking turns to be snuggled and launched. 
It is a very rare species called „boomerang bird“
Princess problems
What a strange boomerang...

Disney Princess Problems
That's better than having two in a bush.
You’re a Disney princess, aren’t you
Looks like you're in need of a horse. 
Move with it to Spain. It will worth a hundred times more than just "two in the bush", as we say "Más vale pájaro en mano, que ciento volando".
"This is a strange nest that tries so throw me away. But I'm smart and I can fly, so i return"
Are you a Disney princess?
"No, you can't make me!"
This snitch is defective.
I always thought when wild animals show “affection” that it must be a past pet reincarnated showing some love. 
The first r/aww post to actually make me say "aww" out loud. Maybe I need to binge the top of all time posts. 😍😍😍
Awh 😍 I want to be a Disney princess!
Op is now officially a Disney princess 
Congrats, you're officially a Disney princess 
That little beak-snuggle after the 2nd toss....
Are you a Disney princess?
Birbarang
Well, if you love something, let it go. If it comes back, it’s yours. 
I've seen a few gifs like this lately. I'm beginning to believe that birds are trying to domesticate people like cats did. 
You know what they, if you set a bird free and they come back to you, you'll be bff. I may have paraphrased this but you get the gist...
Glad this didn't go the way of the horse.... 
Can't help but wonder if this person fostered the little bird as a baby or perhaps an egg and this is a failed release attempt we are seeing. Either way it looks like they've got a little buddy
r/thisismylifenow as a human tree and bird nest 
I know a horse that can take care of your bird problem for you.
I mean a Disney Princess is lucky to have a bird land on them, but you appear to be some kind of Disney Queen or something.   
The down side of becoming a Disney princess.
Hey, accept the fact you're a Disney princess. It's more than obvious. 
Congratulations! You are now snowhite
I was wondering what could have 60k upvotes. Now I understand. :)
Are you a Disney princess?
The bird is yours now, get used to it lol
Princess??
Everything is fun and giggles until you have your hand full of bird poo :/
Boomerang birb?
One in the hand is worth to in the bush
Let him stay you monster!
Congratulations, you are now a Disney princess. Use this power well
Sorry you're a disney princess now.
“If you love something, let it go... if it returns, it’s yours; if it doesn’t, it wasn’t” 

Well, you now have a great “responsi-bird-lity” in your hands. :)

Edit: Typo
OH GOD THAT'S ADORABLE PLEASE ADOPT THE LIL FUCKER.
You are a Disney Princess now 
It's like the best yoyo ever
Birb say, u r fren.

(Seriously, though, that's adorable.)
Hand nest is home now. 

No leave.
You can take the princess out of Disney, but you can’t take out Disney out of the princess.
Probably safer with you, don't think she could survive that long out in the wild 
I think you might be a Disney Princess..
Classic case of Stockholm syndrome )
My heart is melting, omg. 
It’s like playing fetch! But instead of a ball it’s a bird
It really loves you.
I am curious, are birds normally this attached if they are kept as pets or is there some trick?
This is like the one time I tried releasing my duck Aflac. We’d walk him down to the water and walk back to the car and he’d come waddling after us quacking his head off. He wouldn’t let us leave no matter what we did:( So we had to find him a home, and we did, where he also met his soulmate:)
The birb is fetching itself
Conversion rate: two in the bush 
That is the cutest thing. 
*he snuggles*
Aww, That's the sweetest thing I've ever seen! Sweet baby doesn't want to go. 
Congrats on your new pet bird, and status as a Disney princess.
Yo thats gotta be worth at least two in the bush!
This is what domestication looks like. Imagine the first wolf who didn't attack a human. A wolf who just wanted pats and  food.
I’m so glad this isn’t one of those videos where a cat jumps out from nowhere and attacks the bird.
It's like the saying.


If you Love somthing, set it free. If it comes back its yours.

Congratulations 🎉 you own a bird now 

Looks like this one is worth two in the bush
Hope you're best buds now and do cool stuff like go to the cinema together and go camping.
Bird came back. Was it worried about you?
KEEP IT CMON MAN!
Are you a Disney princess? 
You should probably call Disney about your princess movie
Looks like someone's got themselves a little sparrow ❤️
that's a boomerangobird
Haven't verbally said aww to one of these posts for a while, thank you
Whelp, you have a pet birb now.
B-yo-yo-rd 
It looks so snug in OP's hand
He wiggles right into her fingers
New bastion skin is ridicilous
A bird in a hand is worth two in a bush!
I wonder if that bird is being hunted by another and just using the human as a safe place 
Found Snow White's reddit account.
That's a nice Cocoa puffs bracelet
So angel 😍😍😍😍😍
awww


I'd of pitched that sucker like a baseball

it wouldn't of returned then 
"I'm stealing ur warms"
bless this post
This is worth at LEAST 2 in the bush.
Congratulations on becoming a Disney princess.
That hand does look soft and comfy tbh, I don't fault the bird
It is your birb now. You must take care of birb. 
You know what they say. 

If you love it, let it go. If it comes back it’s yours. If it doesn’t then it was never yours to begin with.
The new Pixar short is looking great!
"But bird, I got stuff to do"
Are you Belle from Beauty and the Beast ? 
I am sad that I have but one upvote to give
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The things we already have are more valuable than the things we only hope to get.
Serious case of Disney Princess-itis!!  
Am I the only one who wants that bracelet?
Animal magnetism at work.
Pretty sure you’re now a Disney princess
He so cozy! 
Gifv link for the mobile users?
The sadist inside of me was waiting for you to clench your fist out of annoyance. I apologize for my dark and depressing world view. 
Well, me and that dude would be friends forever. This may sound strange, but I swear that I actively try to avoid situations where I may be around "orphaned" animals. I *do not* want or need a new pet, but my love of animals takes over in situations like that and I just can't help myself.
You have to do this Bernard, it’s for your own good
She is so warm and comfortable in your hands, thats it, she doesn't know you or want you, she seek comfort.
I thought this was going to turn into one of those animal release gone wrong videos where a hawk swoops in and steals Birb the second he flies away
Cursed items cannot be unequipped.
Original comment
Disney princess confirmed 
Me trying to get rid of my insecurities 
That’s a weirdly shaped boomerang...
You is warm. You is now my nest. 
No. I no go. Is safe here 
Birb fren wants to stay!! 
Disney Princess Confirmed
This is so cute <3
I believe that is a boomerang.
I'm convinced you're snow white..
The bird's nest is a walking/moving fortress of flesh that is so cute!
Congrats,you are a Disney Princess.
i literally just heard some standup about how a bird is the only animal you can help by throwing it 
Last week I heard an alarming amount of chirping in my backyard. When I went outside, I saw a baby bird from the nest in our roof fluttering on his back on the floor. I thought maybe he'd been trying to learn how to fly and accidentally broken his wing, but to my horror I saw that he was getting away from a gang of birds who were pecking away at his sibling. I scooped up the surviving baby and placed him in a box, and drove to the nearby shelter to see if they could rehabilitate him. They said they'd have to put him down. It was one of the saddest days of my life. RIP Falcon. 
The downside no one tells you about being a Disney princess. 
Me trying to let go of my anxieties.
It’s gonna shit in your hand, dude..
Sweet yoyo bruh
It's the power of rudrakshas!
Birderang 
This is strangely touching. I find hope for humanity in the smallest places.
I think you've made a new friend. :)
No no no, you're doing it wrong. You have to release him as a pidgeot, not a pidgey. How would he survive on his own in the wild, as a mere pidgey?
That was fun! Do it again! Yippie!
"Til i am a disney princess"
We found our Disney princess???? XD
If you love it, set it free, if it comes back, it's yours.
A wild Pidgey has appeared
Have fun with your new soulmate OP
You are home now 
Oh, twitter has boomerang now?
I want onee
Well that bird is yours forever. No way I could deny the little guy.
"Little bird, little bird, fly through my window, find molasses candy." 
Op stop throwing that bird away, and give him the best life.
So what ended up happening? 
What if it just didn't return one time, you'd be like "O-oh...."
Disney princess?
My screen name checks out
It's like something out of "Snow White." :D
It's Pappy McPoyle, Patriarch of the McPoyle family, and his bird Royale McPoyle
I can just hear Roger from American Dad

"Well I guess this is my hand now" 
"i fits i sits" the universal animal code.
Feathered boomerang.
Wow it seems this boomerang bird had watched [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vQcRFtI-8Tg) before and got inspired (starts a bit after 12:00, don’t know how to timestamp on mobile)
I wonder if it’s fun for the bird

Like a wheeeeeee do it again do it again sort of thing 
"Go Toriyama. Teach a Dinosaur to ride a ball." 
This is one of the of the most adorable things i've seen. Aaaaah thank you OP for making my afternoon <3
LOL little bird doesn't want to grow up yet and face the nasty world on its own.
"If you love someone set them free, if they come back.... They're yours."
Eat it.
What a cool yo-yo 
He is now a fairy tale princess. 
This is what domestication looks like. Imagine the first wolf who didn't attack a human. A wolf who just wanted pats and  food.
That's because he's easily worth two in the bush. He doesn't want you to miss out on the deal of a lifetime.
Well it's worth two in the bush I guess.
Is there a subreddit for small birds in people's hands?
Now if u get another bird u can kill a stone 
r/wooosh
Trust
I shall call him.... Frisbee.
One cannot simply throw the responsibilities of a princess away
i wish i had enough money to give this gold again.
I've heard that's worth two in the bush.
Awwwww “no! This is my hand, there are many like it, but this one is mine!” *snuggles hand*
"hand wrm, no leve"
Has Disney sent you a certificate yet!
That’s a couple of nice bush-birds right there 
When I was leaving to take my son to school one morning, I stepped out the front door to find a thrasher fledgling sitting on the porch flanked by my two cats. I rescue wildlife fairly often, so I quickly scooped him up, placed him in a pet carrier, took him into the garage, and covered the carrier with a towel. I took my son to school, hurried back, and checked on the bird. He appeared unharmed and didn't seem to require a trip to the wildlife rescue. I figured his mom would be looking for him, so I put both of my cats inside, brought the carrier outside, set it down on the porch and opened the door to the carrier. I settled in a chair away from the bird but close enough where I could keep an eye on him (we have several cats in the neighborhood). I patiently waited with him for 2 hours while his mom kept trying to get his attention. I had to shoo away one cat twice and another cat once. The mom kept calling for him, so after about 30 minutes he hopped out of the carrier. She swooped down several times and called to him. Finally, after several tries, he flew up after her and into the trees. 

TL;DR: Waited with a fledgling for 2 hours until his mom successfully coaxed him up into the trees. 
I had s finch like this, it was super excited warm and cuddly, of to be loved so deeply ;)
Hooman stop throwing me plz
Holy shit that is so cute
It's like a yo-yo but you throw it up, not down!
Warm spot, must stay.
Thats so adorable. 
The real Snow White
I don't mean to be THAT guy but.. when handling wild birds and you decide to release them, you should always let them fly off in their own time. Never throw the bird like you see in the movies. 

Your palm should be completely open when releasing them, if the bird feels constricted around it's wings it will be very anxious about trying to fly. 
MAn CrUsHeS bIrD WIth hiS hANd ThEn AgGReSsiVely ThRoWs IT
Is this how you get a bird? It lands on you and never leaves?
Man, that's the cutest yoyo I've ever seen.
But Ricky if you love something you let it go and if it comes back it’s meant to be. 
Trying throwing over hand
My immediate response was "OH NO WHY WOULD YOU THROW THE POOR BABY" promptly followed by "It's a fucking bird, brain."
That little nuzzle. 
Useless pidgey won't battle 
Well, I guess he's yours now... enjoy!!
Hand soft and warm nest 
A hand under the bird is worth two in the bushes. 
boomerang bird the new toy everybody doesn't want anymore, but still has for some reason
Aww he just likes the warmth 
Well, you have a new pet
It's a heated nest, why would it ever leave?
Reminds me of [this Shel Silverstein poem](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/dd/58/a4/dd58a4969bd264399f624f0b0829b845.jpg).
Nice warm "nest". I wouldn't want to leave either.
There’s always a bigger bird
something something a bird in the hand
That's a nice video of two birds in the bush
How is this even possible?
A bird in the hand is worth a lot of aww points
This is so sweet
Love how the bird snugly fits into the cupped hand!
I want this toy 
Let it go bird let it go! 
This is my cat. 
Tweet tweet!
I guess if your first bird keeps coming back like that you don't even need to use your spare-o.
Until he shits in your hand. 

Bye Felicia. 
I would cry if it suddenly flies away.
It is so cute🦆
I had an outside bird friend once.  It couldn't fly so I picked it up and gave him a little safe spot and some food and stuff.  The bird got better but after that it would hang out all the time.  I could pet it and stuff.  We were pretty good buddies.  

Then my little toddler brother killed it on accident when I was at school.  He pulled a Lenny. 
I need this. 
I used to take care of a bird when I was young. It was very attached.
Did anyone else expect the bird to just hit the dirt, splat? No, just me?
This is the cutest thing I've seen this year. 
ITS SO CUTE AWA W A WBA A A A A A 
KEEP IT CMON MAN!
Thats an unusual Yo-Yo
Just keep it
*s m o o s h p o o s h*
do it 1000 times while a string attached between bird and hand. and finally, it will come back to hand on its self.
Someone Explain why is this happening?
There's a robin's nest in our neighbors yard, and there's only one bird left in there. The mother tried tirelessly all day yesterday to get it to fly, but no luck. We're hoping today's the day. It's actually been really fucking cool to watch.
That hand looks cozy af. I wouldn't leave it either.
"I found a warm happy safe nest. I wonder why it is trying to evict me."
Disney Princess Alert!
Congratulations, you're now a Disney Princess
We get it Snow White!  Birds like you!  Quit showing off!
Aww. Before a redditor comes and tells us how there is bird brain parasite that tries to get the bird eaten..
A bird in the hand is worth 2 in the bush. 
Nature's yoyo!
A well a everybody's heard about the bird
B-b-b bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word
A well a bird, bird, bird, the bird is the word
A well a bird, bird, bird, well the bird is the word
A well a bird, bird, bird, b-bird's the word.
That bird loves you
Dude just keep the damn bird 
Little burdy wantsa da cuddle :-) what a snuggler
Gotta love a good Disney princess.
My bird does this too. It can be annoying when I'm trying to leave the house.
If it's a wild bird then most likely a predator near by it is trying to stay safe from. If just a pet then it's super cute.
It's people now
How many birds in a bush is *this* worth?
Bird came back. Was it worried about you?
a bird in hand is worth more than two in the bush
Rose said the same thing and look what happened to Jack 
This post is worth about two in the bush.
A great way to play catch with yourself.
Too precious 
So sweet! I load trucks at UPS and once had a bird stuck in the cab of one of my trucks. I caught and held her as carefully as I could until I got outside, then when I tried to get her to fly away, she wouldn't. I was afraid I hurt her somehow, but then she hopped around in my hand to face me and just stared at me. This lasted for a good 10 seconds or so before she turned back around and flew away. It was a really cool moment I'm never going to forget!
You are a house now. 
very good movise 
That's so sweet <3
I’d keep him
I SHALL NOT LET GO
is there a non-reddit link?

i find myself asking this too often these days..
He/she is know your forever companion. Cherish it.
Would you be willing to trade that one for two birds in a bush?
That's a yoyo bird alright 
Guess you have a bird now, would melt my heart in an instant!
So much cuteness! !!!
sweet little spuggy
You got a friend in me 
The real life Snow White! 
I wonder how the person in the gif feels knowing that they're mow a Disney Princess
well, this made my day. 
So many feels!!!
Sooooo cute!!!!!! (He or she) loves u
I think i just died 
some things need more than one upvote.

Dangerously cute.
So, is it a birderang?
Keep him
:)
I feel a bit sad now that it is dependent. But I don't blame the bird one bit 
"No no. This is my home now"
If you love something set it free. If it comes back, post it for karma.
That's worth at least two in the bush!!
Might be the best thing I’ve seen all year. 
So cosy, must snuggle in tighter. Humans are so clumsy.
Aww. Put him / her on a tree branch? 
Guess you have a new pet now
Let it go! Let it g......  Oh!
A friend rescued a dove and nursed it back to health, then it refused to fly away. Is that the story here?
You workin wit Disney??
Like a birdie yoyo.
Nope, nope I am yours now, feed me.  

It's your new Familiar!
Homing bird!
Keep the fucking bird. 
"You can try to make me fly up, but gravity is always going to pull me down back into this "cozy nest" ".  Anyhow, looks like this would be a epic physics demonstration regarding Newton's laws of motion.
Bird is the word 
Back story?
Go's up comes back down
Haha 
Brain parasite?
I hear thats worth two in the bush!
Lucky bastard
[Nope I don't wanna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mKIuZ4tIzk)
It’s like that episode of Family Guy where that family of birds refuses to leave Peters beard. 
You know what they say..

A bird in the hand if thrown comes back.
Keep it!! 
So adorable! 
Well aren't you just a /r/disneyprincess
Nature's yoyo: love
How did you get the bird to love your hand so much?
This is adorable
This bird had seen all of those videos of released animals getting eaten... smart bird.
“The trees are green,
The birds are singing in the trees,
The girl sips her poison
The bird flies away the girl dies.”
tfw you will never have someone who loves you as much as this bird loves this person
Wish my dad was like this
I guess you have a bird now 
Looks like you have a new pet. Pick out a name 
This warms my heart :) 
what's the story here
“A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.”
The pet that fetches itself! 
That's a weird looking yoyo.
Yes, of course. How shortsighted of me.. Thank you wise one.
If you love something set it free...
A bird in hand is a great wine.
And now you have your familar, your a wisard.
Aww the last snugle 
How does one live their life after this? You’ve been chosen. Now what?
Just put a cat in the other hand. That'll do the trick, one way or another.
So cute
Where can I find a nice bird friend like this
Bird
The fact that they filmed this proves they knew the bird would fly back so my question is why did you try to make it leave in the first place?????
Just like all the websites this week:  
#####ACCEPT COOKIES
The birds loves your bodhi seed bracelet so much 
Gg6
Is that you Snow White?
That is so cute. You can't even see the elastic band :)
Failure to launch 😂
This warm. I stay.
If u love something let it go if it returns it's yours for life
If you love something set it free and if it comes back to you it is yours 
Cold bird, warm hand. 
Body heat.
That is an *incredible* amount of trust. 
That's awesome! lol
You are my nest now
That looks like it's worth two in a bush
Guess your stuck being a princess now.
He's like a real life yo-yo hahaha
Bomerang
That's one cool yo-yo

Wow, this person must do really well with breakups.
Looks to me like that's worth two in the bush.
Friend acquired
this reminds of when my parents try to get me to leave the house and get a job. 
You know those are worth 2 in the bush.
In the hand  of the angel, fly away from

Congrats on becoming a Disney Princess!
So heartwarming! 
He fren
GUESS WHAT U BETTER KEEP HIM
*Brings camera closer* "Now listen here you little shit"
Let's take a moment to appreciate how awesome birds are. Sure they poop on things every once in awhile but if they chose to they could be terrible, instead most choose to sing their lil hearts out for us. (well for other birds but w/e)

Disney princess 
Stop flipping the bird
Well, you shouldn't have named the bird Yo-Yo
Make sur to watur yur an Cermet so it will gro

That hand gives off more emotion than most modern day films.
Do you think this is a mother fucking game?
There may be only one solution, Lenny.

For a sec i thought that was a fish xD........ And you were stopping it from drowning, like that girl in the meme lol
Air zoomies

Are you Mother Nature ?😨😩😩 ❤️
Was surprised to see that the top comment wasn't "Worth two in the bush!" or something
Rumor has it that u/BnarRaouf is still in the woods holding lil' birdie to this day.
I dunno why but the feathers on the back  look disgusting.
Lol
This Sparrow is already endangered in India. If it were me i would never let that cute thing go away from me.
Aww, this is totally precious beyond words. Thank you for sharing.
This is my humen I love my humen. No. No. I will not leave you. I loves you. 
Teach me Master!
It's the new Yo-Yo with invisible wires!

that's your bird now.
Throw that bird again...and I will find you...
I want one 
That’s what love should be. If you let the other one free, he/she will come back.

Then her neighbor did a funny dive in the pool and she burst into applause.
"I'll never let go Jack...I'll never let go.."

"I don't want to be free hooman"
When you tell your girl it’s time to leave 
Let him stay. He wants to nest there.
Interesting yo-yo

That little snuggle at the very end
That cool
Little birb is comfy where he is thank you
>***~~^(hello there)~~***
Lol. Good bird
Heard somewhere that birds will link sexually to a person if the person raises them.  Like how a bird finds a mate for life.  That bird is her boo.
I really want a bird pet... imagine just sitting with your laptop with your bird sitting on your shoulder living it's life...
Awww, new friend! 
Am comfy here
its a yo-yo bird. 
how do I download this?
Boomerang birdie
That is the sweetest thing I’ve seen all day. 
Aaaawwww cumple 100% con su titulo
Completely ignorant to the subject, but my guess would be probably a hawk or another predictor in the area, so he's sticking around with the bigger predator that it already knows won't kill him
Reminds me of my friend who is in his late 30s and won’t leave his mom’s house. 
I'm not sure if this is a baby or not but wouldn't doing this ruin the relationship with the birds parents ultimately passively killing the bird if it was a baby?
Is it a baby? Idk I can't tell and it obvs depends on the species. But if it is and your one of the first livings things it's come into contact with then it likely thinks of you as a parent. Or it may even be abandoned and goes to you. Either way it's a beautiful thing. Give it some food and water but don't cage it see if it'll eventually go or stay.

A small tip: as a general rule please do not throw birds into the air. Many of them have problems to start flight this way. This is why pigeons thrown into the air at weddings or festivals might fall back to earth again. 
They are like magnets 
That little one is yours now. Enjoy!
I would keep that bird forever lol
adorable.... until poop
Warm hooman, fuzzy hooman, weird stretchy ball of skin
Oh my god, birds are freaking amazing
Don't let it go. Be like Goku and give it power.
Did you see that hawk I feel safer in your hand.
Wow. Fuck Reddit. I could post the same exact bird in a bush and not even get halfway to the front page!
It's worth two in the bush!
He warm
Snow White confirmed! 
Hand is best nest
You have a pet birb now .
Awwwwwwwwwww
Tbats awesome. 
Let it go... Let it go...
You're my hooman now!
This is my favorite comment, thank you you wonderful person!
This made my week.
I told her she could go, but she Wouldn’t Leave. 
A bird in the hand twice is still only worth two in the bush ...
Ok so you are also a Disney princess
Clearly OP got adopted by this bird. What a lucky guy/girl!
Birb
Set it free & if it stays it's yours. Guess it's yours....
Okay, fine, you can stay. But I need that hand, get on my shoulder. 
Well, you're stuck with a bird now. Better invest in the right seeds.
F
I guess it's hers forever.
What is that bracelet? Vajra Bodhi?
The world is too scary 
This is your life now.
I want 50
When you’re a Disney princess.....
