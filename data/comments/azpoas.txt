That is a defensive instinct of baby deer that kicked in at the wrong time and place. 

Baby deer often drop down and remain still when they see a predator. They are not fast enough to out run a predator when they are that young. So trying to hide is a better option than running and exposing yourself to a predator that can easily catch up. 

Actually, when mother deer are foraging, babies often hide in tall grass or bushes like this, until the mother returns. If you take a walk in the woods during calfing season, you can sometimes come across such babies. They won‚Äôt move a muscle until you get really really close. I got scared few times by a fawns dashing out of bushes that I was just walking past. As most predators avoid tracks used by humans (or any place that has human scent), mother deer often hide their babies close to such location. Unfortunately this also include roadways.
Baby looks brand new 
Aw poor thing. Such a good mommy though 
How the fawn walks on those spider legs is beyond me.
[deleted]
The fawn only looks hours old! Props to mama deer.
The best part of this is how the mama deer has mad skills turning off car engines. 
r/humansbeingbros
Elon Musk wants to know your location.
Baby deer defense mechanism is so cute.  Its natural instinct is "no way can I outrun this predator, maybe I can just hide and it will go away".
[deleted]
A similar occurrence happened with me one time. The guy behind me was honking up a storm because he was too impatient to give them time to get off the road. It pissed me off.

&#x200B;

EDIT: This was on a non-busy road near a pond. I wasn't the only one stopped either. I disagree that we put anybody in danger.
r/fawns would like this.
"Coast clear? Ok then... SWIGGITY SWOOTY" 
Oh dear
Dammit man, I had a deer jump outta the woods tonight before I could stop fully on the way to work tonight. I think it got up and continued on but I still feel bad. This video doesn‚Äôt make it better.
I'm fawn-ed of this.
Poor lil guy was so scared üò≠
Aww such a Tiny baby :(
...and they walked off in the middle of the road. Natural selection was paused, but not stopped here.
I cannot upvote this enough.. that baby deer so so cute I cried üò≠
r/AnimalsBeingMoms
Drivers just be careful, especially at night. The thing with deers is that they jump in front of the car intentionally. It's a tactic how to scare a predator, cuz when you're a predator you expect the victim to escape right? Well deers jump right in front of him to confuse him and scare.
Lucky the driver wasnt Elon Musk
Thank you so much for being patient and kind enough to stop as you did. 
What a guy though, stopping and turning off the car rather than being impatient
Phrased implying the mama deer turned off the car on her own like the badass superdeer she is
to dumb people who criticize baby deer, remember its humans who made the road in their area. They still dont know about cars. All they know is it travels fast. I dont say that humans are wrong to make road through wilderness but atleast have some compassion towards animals for their supposed ignorance. 
You won't know it but you'll never have problems with hitting a deer ever again. I swear. I was an idiot who waved at deer passing the road and now they see my car & stop before crossing. 
I wonder though, given her location on the road that move might have made her small enough to go under the car if it hadn't stopped.
Awe poor baby. Good thing they got out safely 
Why was the momma deer driving in the first place 
Awww such cute dolphins
Is this your video, or reposted? If this is yours. You're a fucking gem of a person and I wish I could hi five you.
*Proceeds to walk on the road*
So nice of you to turn the car off! 
I had something similar in the woods of Lake George.  I was walking down an old trail at a camp I used to go-to as a kid and found a Fawn and a doe just standing their standing.  The doe stood watching me as the Fawn just leisurely grazed on some grass on the edge of the path.  It was Serene and very surreal at the same time.  I look back at this moment and keeps reminding me the beauty of nature and how fragile it is.
I just don't understand why they won't move the deer crossing sign away from traffic areas...?  It's a terrible place to tell the deer to cross the street... 

- some lady on the radio
I felt that in my chest 
Gotta love moms 
Reminds me of one time when I was driving and come around a curve and all of a sudden see mama dear with two babies. They start booking it down the side of the road when they see me coming and mom jumps over the metal railing into the woods, baby #1 follows but baby #2 can't get over the railing, so she just keeps running along the road until the railing runs out and then dashes into the woods. I felt so bad - I slowed down but it didn't stop her from frantically trying to get away and not being able to until the railing ran out. 
When I see things like this it makes me feel guilty that I use Reddit for porn 
r/deerarefuckingstupid
Aww!! nature is so precious!
This makes me incredibly happy
Oh deer. So cute. 
That‚Äôs awesome!
My enneagram animal is a deer. Everyone pictures them as them as these frightened creatures. However, they do what needs to be done. They still go get food, cross roads, and embrace fear because that‚Äôs what they need to do despite their skittish behavior. ‚ÄúIs it courage or faith to show up every day‚Äù -Sleeping At Last
My grandpa was tractor mechanic (os that how it's called in english? He repaired all sorts of farming machines) and told me that baby deers often lay down to hide in the field when the wheat harvester comes closer and on many occasions they got into the harvester that way... 
they can't see me if i'm flat.
Aw Bambi. All I can think is how accurate that animation is. 
People that safely stop when they can, to help animals or others, are the best.
It looks like the mama deer is saying "I'm sorry about this, kids these days. I'll get her out of the street"
I'm a human who understands cars and roads and even I get fucking scared crossing the road at times. I can't imagine the fear these animals feel seeing a car approaching. Poor little duder.
Smh it‚Äôs obvious they both just wanted some of that insurance‚Ñ¢Ô∏è money. You can clearly see the baby faked being hurt and then just runs of completely unscathed. Deers these days I swear...
Then they walk in the middle of the street. Deer are so fucking stupid.
My first thought was, ‚ÄúHaha, stupid, awkward baby deer.‚Äù but then I remembered human babies and now I‚Äôm ashamed.
Love how she looks at the driver like "what the fuck have you done"

This is instinctual. The baby deer can not outrun its predators so the mom will run a away and the baby will hide and can lower its heartrate to almost a full stop so they will not be found. When the threat has gone the mom will sniff around for the baby until they are reunited.  
Be careful. I've heard that deer will use the scared fawn in the middle of the road to lure in their human prey.

I once came across a fawn not much bigger than this while driving down a country road with fences 2 or 3 feet off the shoulder of the road on both sides. The mother jumped the fence and into the tall grass when she saw my car and the baby was left of the other side off the fence. The baby started to run the length of the fence got confused and tried to get into the opposite side of the fence but couldnt jump high enough. I figured it would get hit so I stopped, picked it up and set it on the side with its mother. She came back to greet her baby and they both took off. Its little heart was going so fast when I was holding it. 
Boss: Why were you late again?

Me: you won‚Äôt freaking believe it
How do people kill these for sport?!

Probably goes off of their natural instincts to hide in that situation.

Poor fella didnt realize that hiding in the middle of the road was a generally bad idea since there isnt much grass there.

We should start making them geurilla suits so they can stay camoflaged at all times.
To me it looks like the deer is throwing a toddler tantrum, and momma deer ain't putting up with that shit. 
So beautiful, wish we had more people like you, nature should be protected and cherished 
I think most humans don't realize just how incredibly fucking loud we are, in general, when compared to nature.
This literally made me melt and miss my little puppers waiting at home for me even more.

This happened to me in VA on a winding mountain road. I saw mom cross the road then tiny baby jumped out, saw me and my car and collapsed. I was afraid another car would either hit me or speed around me and hit the baby so I got out and was able to shew her across the road where she ran to mama hiding in the trees. Adorable and scary at the same time.
I watched this 10 times... his little wobble legs running away are so fucking precious !!!! ‚ô•Ô∏è

In ~~NZ~~  Quebec someone stopped in the middle of the road for some ducks. Person behind them crashed and they died. Was a pretty big story because the person who stopped in the middle of the road were in the wrong. 

Edit: Quebec
Deers are like dogs on pogosticks. Tell me I'm wrong, I dare you
this made my heart hurt, so precious!!!
Would it be wise for us to scare the deer when they get close to roads? Throw shit and scream at em? So they associate the road with crazy apes?
Such beautiful timid creatures they literally harm nobody in this world but sadly you wouldn't know this by some of the comments here.... Back off the deer dears.... 
So very kind.

Good on you for actively trying to calm them down.

Aaaaand still in the middle of the road.
Oh! Dear,
It's simple instinct. It sees the car as a predator and instinctively ducked down to kinda hide, until mama gives the "all clear "message.

The wilderness where these animals are safe is getting smaller. They should never have this encounter if only we humans didn't expand our territory to their habitats.

Typical deer in the road.

Oh should we get out of the way and head back into the woods?

Nah, let's just walk down the road instead.
I came upon a fawn that did this while I was on my motorcycle. Walked up to it and pet it for a minute. A loud diesel truck approached and scared it off.

As cute as this is, its taking too long for the mother and the kid to escape, this video is almost half a minute long not counting the time before the recording even started.

They all do this. I'd be driving, see a shitload of them in the road, and then stop. I'd get out and clap as an "I don't have time for this shit / Get out of the road before something hits you." and they'd just hit the deck and stay there.

I kinda had an experience like this a bunch of years back.  It was spring, and when I was turning the corner into my neighborhood there was a group of 5 or 6 tiny bunnies in the middle of the road.  They panicked and started following each other running away in a circle, right in the middle of the road.  I had to get out of my car, and try to coax them off the road.  It was kinda adorable.
Aww that‚Äôs cute how wonderful his or her mother picking him or her up. ü•∞üòòüòç
I know you‚Äôre fine-  stop acting like such a faun 
I still have no idea why kids do this sort of thing. 
This Mama loves her baby deerly!
I love how the momma does not even have to really pick it up but just boop it with her nose and shes fine. Good for you to give them the time they needed, would have been such a shame if someone hit them :(
Omg. I'm tearing up. This is so bitter sweet. To think it was that scared- thank goodness you're a great person for considering to stop- and turn off the car altogether.
Not many people know that the term "Fight or Flight" actually also has an "or Freeze" part. Many animals will freeze in the face of danger, some to the point of passing out. It happens to humans as well. We can be overwhelmed by a dangerous or unfamiliar situation and don't know how to react, so we do nothing, which is sometimes the worst possible reaction.
I like the look the mom deer gave after she sniffed her baby..... An excited "BABY IS OK!!!" to the human. Because she could tell the human was also concerned.
#ELON MUSK WANTS TO KNOW YOUR LOCATION
Oh my goodness. Fresh baby.

My heart was unprepared.
Is this in Australia 
 there is no pure love like mom love ‚ù§‚ù§

This exact thing happened to me a while back very close to my house. The small animal just dropped to the ground and made itself as small as possible on the side of the road. Broke my heart a little but we continued to drive slowly by, not wanting to make things worse. A few days later though, there were trails of blood and my SO told me that there was in fact a baby deer lying dead on the side of the road. I never saw it though, someone had taken it away by then. I don't know if it was the same one but it was really sad knowing that one baby deer out there didn‚Äôt make it. The deer wanders mostly around the same places since I live near the woods, so it's not unlikely it was the same one. 
This one never fails to warm my heart and melt it at the same time <3
Elon musk : HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
The roads out to where I work are fairly busy, so this is often the best thing to do if the mama is around. Too much traffic will keep her from coming to the rescue like this, so you either have to just leave and hope for the best or try to move it yourself.

Just have to be careful not to actually touch it and get your scent on it, use a fresh towel or gloves and just transition it to the grass. We typically move them since they're as good as dead if left in the road, semi-trucks and all, so they at least stand a better chance in the grass. 
That was me at 4 years old. My 12 year old Sis  came back for me in the middle of the road.

Deer are a sad situation where I'm from. Despite deer hunting season being wildly popular, despite constant poaching, there is still a major deer overpopulation. They just stand in herds of 6-8 in the road. They jump out in front of vehicles and off of hillsides into windshields. I feel sorry for them but also know there is a real chance they'll cause me to be in a bad car accident. 
is that Canela?
 very beautiful, the purity of the nature of animals  
 
"Get up son he stopped"
"stopping and turning the car off to help them calm down". Why not just drive away? That would've helped also.
Awww that's soo cute
I think they were attempting insurance fraud 
*Dies due to excessive cuteness*
And then continued to walk right down the *middle of the fucking road,* having learned nothing from the experience. 

As a midwesterner, I have to imagine this has come up at deer meetings. 

"Well deerfolk, we've lost another dozen of us this week. How bout we consider Franks idea of not walking down, standing in, or leaping out into the great grey paths that those things travel on? Especially around dusk and nighttime. Could we try that?"

It was kind of sad when she timidly walked up to it, as if she were afraid it was dead. But it was cute when the fawn got up and her ears went back in relief.
Each time I see a thread like this I cant help but remember the women in canada who stopped to let ducks cross the road. 

Two people died, including a tennager, when they didnt see her car parked for no reason in the middle of the road. She got life in prison for involuntary manslaughter, last time I heard about  it and she was appealing.

If you do find a baby deer who does this and the road it too busy to wait, you can look around to see if you can spot her and move the baby into the tall grass on the correct side of the road.   It is a myth that touching the baby will cause its mother to reject it, but you shouldn't touch baby wild animals unless it's necessary because you can easily unintentionally injure them.

This is so sad. I've seen this before, however, it was on a really busy road and there was nothing that could be done. The road did have a marked off median and I hope the deer eventually got the courage to get up and finish crossing the road. I didn't see a corpse after work thankfully. But yeah, real small deer just cowering in the middle of the road. I felt so bad.
My little hearts melting 
It's so sweet how gentle the mother is, as if to teach the baby not to be scared.
Mama deer in action
Great, now that fawn will think every car will stop if it just lies down in the middle of the road... 

^(/s)
I know its a baby, and that even for adults there are reasons for their behavior, but deer logic is still mind boggling to me:

There's something larger and faster than me coming straight at me! What do I do!? How about just lying down or stand still right in front of it!! That'll work!
I got chills. See how much the mother cares about her child!
I want to just give that baby a hug so bad
Oh thank god I thought it was dead
Good that the mama dear stopped and turned the car off
Didn't realize it was a baby deer till it got up. Such cuteness!

I was like that ain‚Äôt no baby. That‚Äôs a full grown doe. Then I saw it. 

Oh my gosh, my heart just melted see that. 


The mama deer stopped and turned the car off? Wild animal intelligence is getting scary.
Well we know they weren't driving a Tesla, Elon has programmed them to ensure the demise of all "dolphins" 
0:10 mom's like "hey @$$hole, you hurt my kid?  No?  Ok come along, Junior."
Natural selection at it‚Äôs most anthropogenic.
Anybody know what the movie about animals where they call the road the "black river"? And the older animals are like "never cross it!" 
Stop, drop, and... roll your ass away from oncoming traffic.
Cute
r/elonmuskjoke
My heart melted...
Dolphin.exe has stopped. 
I hope they eventually got out of the road!!!
Cool
Aw poor thing..
Awww! Good human!
Mama's encouragement actually. 
Wtf are dolphins doing in land?!
And Mama deer continues to stroll down the road. C‚Äômon, mom.
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre right, it probably depends on the farmer.  I wish it could be a mandate. 
Elon Musk disapproves 
It's like the opposite of the Prometheus run.
Awwww
Well this made me cry unexpectedly, so there‚Äôs that. 
I‚Äôm crying üò≠ 
Dolphin
I don't remember that in Bambi
The spots on the fawns back simulate light coming through a canopy of trees. They are nearly invisible and have almost no smell. ü§ì
I saw this with twin baby deer. I hope mama came back for them. Didn't see her anywhere in sight.
Elon musk wants to know your location 
Nobody: ...
Russian dashcams: 
I remeber a deer some years back that panic froze on a 2 lane expressway. We are about five cars stopped with hazard warning lights, and still theres an idiot coming full force around us all. So of course he manages to hit the deer that had finally come to it's senses and try to pass.

Hitting deers in my area is pretty common, we have a lot of them. But doing it like that is just plain stupid.
This is why I'm not a big fan of deer. I grew up in a small town out in the country, and deer would sometimes just hurt themselves right into the car. Iv even known people that were parked when the deer just jumped into them. I get that it's not their fault that humans fuckednup their environment, but damn if they ain't dumb.

Still cute tho
Still better than R/entitledparents
So, the mama deer stopped and turned the car off? Then cautiously came to the rescue? What a talented deer. 
This is so cute yet so sad. Fuck it im gonna cry in the cafeteria 
Aww üò•
how bamby shoud have ended

&#x200B;
Reminds me of that woman asking for park rangers to move the deer crossing signs.
Ohh, that‚Äôs sad :( 
Dolphins are very interesting aren't they.
Omg‚ù§Ô∏è AWEEEE
But it's a dolphin.

 Elon musk: mission failed. We‚Äôll get em next time
Cutissimo
That baby dear wanted out already. 
Emo deer.
That poor baby deer üíõ
Bless you for being a good human!!!
Wheeew!
Now honk.
My heart
I love you beautiful deer
Aww
r/humansbeingbros
A million adorable üòç
Fucc musk 
Was a couple of cars behind this and couldn‚Äôt see this üò≠
‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I hate when she gets like this.‚Äù 
Aww
Ugh my heart .. cant take it .. so adorable
r/nonononoyes
I cried. 
Meanwhile, the deer I see are willing to pull juke maneuvers to make you think all is safe before flinging their body back out into the road to try and make you hit them.
I‚Äôm not crying......god damn onions 

Bless the driver for stopping
Gotta be hours old.  Thank you car guy/gal 
Yeah 
Aw!!!! so cute! :)
This has just completely melted me üòç
What a sweet wobbly baby!
Poor thing
I've almost stepped on a baby deer about that size before while walking through the woods. I had no idea it was there until I was literally about to step on it. Even when standing over it, it just laid still and barely even looked up at me. I guess it serves its purpose as a defense mechanism. 
Is this in Rosemount????
Now I will be even sadder every time I see a dead fawn on the road :( Knowing the parent(s) probably went back to check on them just as she does here...
I almost hit some deer one morning on the way to work. They jumped into the road, and started slipping and sliding because with their sharp hooves they couldn't get any traction on the tarmac. Now I understand why they can't get out of the way. If they walk they are fine, but if they try to run or jump they lose their footing.
You, sir or ma'am, are a hero.
This just shows how well-animated the movie Bambi was - they look exactly like Bambi and his mom! The way she bends her head down to encourage him and how he stands up on his wobbly legs is just like how they were drawn in the movie. So sweet!
Come on baby get up get up get up now we gotta go.  üòä 
"Son, get the FUCK UP now...."
I don't think I've ever been anywhere where that amount of time went by and another person wouldn't have driven by 
MY HEART
Aww! That's adorable.
Sometimes I really feel bad for being a human
O Juan ls9A? Mil km y a U8s
That was so gentle! I would've done the nasty Mommy whisper "Get up now, you are embarrassing me"!!
This will prob get lost and never seen ever by anyone üòÇ, but my hubby had to do this for a baby too. He ended up having to get out though and shoo the baby into the woods because she wouldn't get up. 
my heart just cried. <3
And these bastards out here driving over ‚Äúdead animals‚Äù.....lay down, 
Many areas are building deer crossings under or over the road, for all the animals 
Dumb ass deer just keeps walking down the street
When afterwards they just stroll on the street instead of getting off it:  
[MOOOVE!!!! MOOOVE!!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/bcnr65/woman_refuses_to_move_for_car_driver_beeps_horn/)
Fears crossing the road, then proceeds to walk down instead of into the grasslands
This is great and all but why wouldn‚Äôt you reverse a bit? Maybe it wasn‚Äôt safe on the road or something. ? Just the person filming is still super close even with the engine off that would be super scary for the deer.
Aww I knew deer were nice creatures
bad
You know, I‚Äôd like to own a deer...

...but the poop...
Thank you good citizen
Fucking repost
Wow
Prolly got ran over

This video will make Elon Musk's day
And then it walks directly through the center of the road
Wow that's cool
It looks like a spider hahaha
[removed]
I like the term 'fawn' (I'm Dutch). It paints a really cute picture in my mind. Exactly what they are. It's such a spot on name.
was this in pennsylvania?
A rare blessed post
I'm a shitty person for saying this but imagine the driver just fucking revs the engine really loud
That would be infuriating if you're in a rush to have to stop and wait on a baby deer

Dont get me wrong, it's cute, but annoying
Me when I hear a sound at night
Dumbass deer didn't even have the sense to get out of the road
Certainly glad mama dear stopped and turned off the car before helping her fawn.
# WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY CHILD
That thing was just fucking born jesus
r/all
This is how I deal with my problems
If I where driving and mama dear came I would step on it!

I‚Äôve been lucky enough to witness this first hand.

Diver is cool as AF.
Than the deer gets run over
Elon the Muskrat: laughter
I‚Äôm so glad I found this right before I couldn‚Äôt upvote it anymore
More proof that babies are dumb
You should have used your car to hunt them.
Why didn‚Äôt you run it over
Rats with hooves
[deleted]
You made me cry on my way home from the bar
oh deer i hope it‚Äôs alright 
That‚Äôs the sweetest thing ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
aww material indeed
You sir, made my day. Not easy this time of day.
It is so much love, a mum can not leave her baby if they are in trouble.
Aww
So beautiful a mamma's love 
Should have run it over. Natural selection, No?
/s
Are the words fawn/doe still taught in school? 
Mama is life
why are animals so bad at surviving, they've been on earth longer than humans.
Dam decent of you human
We don‚Äôt deserve to be on this planet
This shit made me wanna stop eating meat
And still they don‚Äôt get off the F‚Äôing road! Stupid animals.
Mmmm venison. 
Rats with hooves... 
It is sad that we are destroying their habitat. We are pushing them to civilization where they run these life threatening risks every day. Some are not as lucky üòî
It‚Äôs cute but oh my god deer are so stupid, why is their instinct to kill themselves 
Deer are super cute 
And super stupid 
Hol up they just walking down the road what if another car comes; still liked the video though
And floor it to stop the spread of CWD
Thanks for stopping and blocking traffic for that little deer. Hopefully, it learned to stay away from the roads....
They let him go!!! Noooooooooooo
Fourth repost to date look at the one i posed a year ago 25.5k upvotes frontpage
First thing they do is keep walking on the road...
Repost
"Come on, kid, let's walk down the middle of the road."
Carries on walking down on the street. Something tells me hooting and scaring them off, might save their life one day.
You really shouldn't turn your car off in the middle of the road 
Damn nature, you beautiful.
FLOOR IT
Great survival tactic there, Darwin
Dumb animal. 
And then they slowly stroll off down the middle of the road because deer are assholes.
Then they crossed the road and a 16 wheeler truck obliterated them, this is why the video cut off.
So the baby deer uses a crappy defense mechanism at the wrong time? You should have continued and let natural selection take its course.  Then we'd have less accidents with less stupid deer. 
Spoiler Alert!
Both Mama and fawn got splattered all over the windshield of another guy going 100mph in 60mph limit zone. 
You should have hit it
It‚Äôs a nice sentiment but you could have caused a serious accident stopping in the middle of the road and turning your car off.
