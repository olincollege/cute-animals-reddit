I like to put my chin at the top of my cat's scratching post when he is giving it a dig.  He'll claw his way to the top of it then tap my nose with his paw.  Too damn cute.
The cat winked at the start
Whatever this cat is saying is pretty inflammatory. Both my cats have raced into the room and are now staring at my phone.

 THE MEOW MAKES THIS SO MUCH CUTER!! 😭😭❤️
Jesus christ that's the cutest fucking thing I've seen all day.
This 3 sec video touches his hand 
What type of breed is that?

Or 

r/dangerdaggers
...it's four seconds
THIS VIDEO IS 4 SECONDS GWAHHHH
This video defies the law of reposts... because I end up watching it 6 times in a row and am never upset to see it reposted. 
And the lil' wink at the very beginning!!! 😻
Holy shit. That cut through the fog of my depression with my grandma dying. Watched it for minutes while smiling the entire time 
And the kitty goes...........MEOWFIVE🐱🖐

I’d love to share this but I can’t because /u/piyushrose used v.reddit! 🙃
Monster Hunter
This 3 second video is 4 seconds long
Ooo nice repost!
I've found that cats need to be given a fair amount of attention in their youth. I had 2 cats (one sadly passed away at 6 this year) and the young one that I didn't fawn over was more food motivated and didn't spend a lot of time with us. On the other hand the older one is my first pet I got living in my own and he constantly wants my attention and love. My wife says, "I can never love you as much as Grayson does" as he looks up at me while laying on my stomach at my desk.
Is that a Lynx Point Siamese? I have one and they are the best!! 
Oh how cute 
FUCKING CUTE
 Nice repost
repost
*such support*
cats being bros.
This is Shijimi Mike on Twitter, and they only post about the cat. I'm a little in love with them :)
Kitty.
This is a palico 
I like to think this guy was trying to get his cat in on a heist for months but the cat was hesistant and then finally this happened
#aww
PLEASE SOMEONE MAKE A MIRROR BOT FOR VREDDIT LINKS FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!

I smell cats, cuteness and..... And some.......Repost!!
Notice how the cat's claws come out. Not as innocent as it looks.

Just spent the last 5 minutes playing this over and over again for my cat's who became incredibly interested. 
Omg I watched it twice before realizing there was sound! 100xs cute with sound!!
Its like a real life pokemon
*hand

Just a simple misspelling I assume. 
OH MY GOD
Actually, that's a hand. 
Oh sweet baby Jesus 😍😍😍
Man the person who originally posted this must be pissed 
This needs to be looped...


And this needs to happen to me

Hi five dude yeah back at you 😃
Wow ive never seen that before (https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/a0cnl3/give_me_five/?st=JPUDXTWN&sh=120b9276) 
If I was stranded on an island and can only bring 3 items, I’d choose this video...3 times. 
Repost
Touches your heart unless you have a cat with similar behavior. Cute the first time. Annoying the 100x after. 
All you people talking about how you wish your cat were like this, spending real time with your cat, at least half an hour a day, helps them bond to you more. The more time you spend, the more your cat bonds with you, the more it will show you affection. Not all cats are the same however, so your mileage may vary. 
REEEEEPOOOOOOOOOOST
Oh my god
Those eyes omg my heart 
socuuuute
It mostly just wants food.
My heart is touched
Awww..
That cat must be Australian since everything it says sounds like a question?
I tried to get my cat to high five and she immediately stuck her claws out and dug the shit out of my arm...
I can watch this all day!
Gorgeous cat hi 5.
and that cat is **so handsome** too.
I think that may be the audio (AND video) clip of the perfect meow.
Why so short.....
This could be an anime.
Thats the meowesty meow ive ever heard
Ahhww that's just cute
Baby!! 🐈
And there's a new slice on the palms. Those murder mittens will getcha
Mr. Robot cat. Hang in there.
Claw five!
shifu high fiving tai lung 
Ohmygod that's so pure 
And his hand
That moment when you saw this on Instagram before reddit. THE LIFECYCLE OF MEMES IS REVERSING!!!
What do you think he’s saying? 
My cat stretches his paw up and touches my face shoulder etc. It’s pretty darn sweet. 
I love it when cats are “responsive,” like, when they want to reach out and acknowledge the owner’s actions. It’s super adorable.
That’s a precious mew. 
Wonder Twin powers activate!
My cat is weird she stares at me 
But I still love her 
You better close up your chest cavity, mate!
team work!
Fuck my heart 😭
I can translate for you.  What he said was "Now you have filthy kitty litter germs on you - enjoy toxoplasmosis!"
I’ve watched this a number of times that I am embarrassed to announce 
the cat has chosen you
My cat is just sitting right next to me and watching this... I wonder if it knows what's up.
Touched my heart too!
That is an almost perfect "meow" 

11/10 would give chin scratches
Sooo gooooddd

Wasn't expecting sound. My cats are looking for your cat.

Cat: Yeah!
I clicked going "please have sound please have sound"

Not disappointed.

r/catswhoyell

thank you for bringing this into my life.
It's times like these I wish I wasn't insanely allergic to cats.
I want a cat that talks a lot :(

Dat ear scoop!
I want a cat.

This made me so happy that cats exist haha
r/catswhoactuallyyell
That was a textbook meow😭😭 
This three second video is four seconds.
And reddit videos are so awful it took twice as long to start playing this.
Too good
Awwwww that meow
Thats my cat😭😭😭😭😍😍😍😍😊😊😊😊
My gosh i can’t believe how cute it is 😍
/r/cathighfive would love this :D
Meow five!😸🖐
DIS CJUTE :’))
My cat of 17 years passed away yesterday, this gave me the push to go adopt another companion. Thank you, I needed this.
The way she smiles and meows, like it's out of an anime. I adore this cat. Makes me miss my dead kitty so much. 
Holy shit I can't stop looping this. That meow is so cute!
How many times is this going to get reposted with a different title?
r/madememelt
Uhh, no. It touches your hand.
His face at the end did it for me
I can almost see him go "SWAT KATS"
Retoast 
Beautiful kitty. Wishing your kitty a long, happy and healthy life

r/bettereveryloop
This cat looks identical to my Lucifer. 🖤
caption: 'put it there, dude'
Cuteness overload!
*Cat hi fives*

"YEEEAAAAHHHH!" 
"My man" he says. 
yeah but if it would've been a dog it would've touched all my organs
Did your cat wink at me?
meoooow
High five!
That meow killed me. I am deceased. 😭😭😭
Why didn’t you make it a gif?
How the fuck does this have over 37k upvotes? 
Jesus that is one unit of a thumb.

A real life Palico :o 
The very best Palico.
/u/vredditmirrorbot
Just watched this 8 times. I feel satisfied. 
thanks for providing this entertainment as my cats tried to figure out where the new cat was.
Definitely the cutest thing I've seen in 2018.
I need it looped and uploaded directly into my cerebral cortex so I'm never sad again 
4 second, but who's counting?
This is amazing! 
Can someone please put this on an endless loop!?
Can someone please giffify this :<
"Yeah high paw!"
Oooh! So cute. It looks like my cat who passed away 2 years ago. I miss him so much... He was my life:
http://imgur.com/gallery/arFPetv

Lynx point cats are really beautiful! 
I think that's a hand, not your heart
Someone tell me how to download this video on mobile please. I'm on iPhone. 
God damn that's cute 
I love cats. Stupid wife doesn't love cats. Stupid wife.
What about 4 sec video that you uploaded? Is that extended cut? 
Watched it the first time without sound.  Had to rewatch with sound because *meeoooow...*
Wink
“Yea! You can do it, human!”
Ami I jumping around.....all nimbley bimbley?
Omg!!!!!
Man every time I see these videos I want to get a cat but then I remember that I'm away from home 12 hours a day.
had this full volume and it scared the fuck out of me
Your cat friend is class.
Awe
This 3 second video melts my heart!!! :DDDDDD
Is cute and good friend like my pretty kitten ❤️
Humans have hearts in their hands!?
And holy moly does it ever trigger this Yorkie that I currently am currently dog sitting. 
My cat doesn’t let me out of my room until I either pick him up or scratch his head. Granted I got him for a shelter just about 3 months old... from day 1 he wouldn’t leave my sight and had to make eye contact every hour or so... love him.
I think this is Nala Cat
W H O L E S O M E  A F 
I just died
My cats just break shit
Me: "I won't be touched, nope I refuse."

Me after video: *sobbing* "So... adorable..."
Words cannot describe how complete I feel after watching this.
But can this cat cook a 4 course meal and help you kill monsters?
I like how the cat turned back its left ear right before touching their hand.  Soooo cute
This is going to be a very cute production company title card one day.
Aww
I'm legit crying right now. The way the kitty looks at him, touches his hand, blinks, and meows absolutely touches my heart.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoX7MOqsWEk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoX7MOqsWEk)
Taught my cat to fistbump for treats. Now he wakes me up by violently fisbumping my hands until I play with/feed him.
That's a "give me cuddles and attention" boop and meow. 
Definitely better every loop.
My cat perked up at this video like: da fuq?
Made my day
Still as cute as when it was on the front page last week. 
Cat.
What does he want to say?
Now THIS is already a good morning ☺️

Edit: how to make this my text tone...
ITS A PALICO
also repost
Just watched this in the post office with full volume. Needless to say, they all think I’m shipping a cat. 
High 5 with a cat is just meow <3
I was listening to Andrew W.K Ready To Die, and the kitty matched the sound exactly and it was glorious. 
A repost but a good repost
isnt this a repost?
oh my god ahb
I want a cat, can't have a cat 😔 
This 3 sec repost touches my heart
You could say it *stole your heart* cue persona music

High five kitty
Kitty doesn't understand high fives, which makes it so much better. 

He just wants to hold hands :)

This is too cute, but alas, for I only have one upvote to give.

Too cute.
Short and sweet, loved it!
“Be a good boy okay?”

I don't have the right words or emoticons to express what I feel over this cute video.
Wow ive never seen that before (https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/a0cnl3/give_me_five/?st=JPUDXTWN&sh=120b9276) 
What a sweet baby 😭
That cats new name is stitch. I don't care what anyone else tells me.

    *snort snarl* Hiiii.

Don't act like you don't know the scene 
Great you woke my cat up, time for skritches I suppose. Oh well 😄
First post on this subreddit i’ve actially vocally sad “aww” to ❤️
I can see it also touches your hand.
I hope he remembered to lick his paws clean after using the litter box.
I translated that as “Yeah, buddy!”
for the first time in a while I smiled.
Aww, this just made my day! ♡
r/DisneyEyes
my cat does stuff like this, including high fives. guarantee the cat was saying "ok ya fuck i did your stupid high five, now give me some gato snacks!!!"
And his hand
Human: Wanna binge watch Samurai Pizza Cats?  


Cat: Yea!
woah
Your heart is shaped like a thumb.
AAAAAHHHH TOO CUTE!!!!!!!
Wow! Cool...High Five!
Omg 😢😢 so cute omg
I think my inners just melted
My cat likes to bite my chin when he's affectionate, which makes it tough to cuddle.
Super amazing 
*God has joined the server*
And everything is right with the world once again :)
I absolutely love its beautiful blue eyes
I have an allergy for cats but this video, hmmmm.
it's 4 seconds dude.
SOSUNSER!  

RAAAAH! 
Not a meow, it's a YEAH!!!! 
My heart 😍
I taught my dog to high five and it’s pretty damn cute. She knows she gets a treat if she does it so she looks sooo pleased with herself afterwards 😂
You should have made it gif
u/vreddit_bot
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah.   So cuuuuuuuuuute
#oof
This is enough to make me cry
Could not help but audibly “awww” watching this. 
This reminds me so much of my old cat Casper.

He used to do cute shit like this all the time.

It's too bad he turned into a bloodthirsty maniac and attacked the hell out of me and my girlfriend and traumatized her to never want cats again...
Okay I’ll say it. 

This might be the greatest cat video of all time 
-draws blood- the pact is sealed
My cat doesn't do this, however loves to paw my face and beard if I am focusing on a game or napping.
This makes me want to hug my cats and show them this video so they can learn
That's  what it wants!

Gotta love it!! Seen it before but just can't stop watching!!
This cat is the truest bro.
I think I’ve watched this at least 50 times I love it so much 
The most wholesome meow
That was awesome.
i watched it 100000 times

&#x200B;
Is it just me or the cat extended his/her claws right at the end?
[One Hour Loop of Cuteness ](https://youtu.be/GxPyUcMtC5E) 
Repost or not it’s still a SUCH CUTE VIDEO 
The meow at the end. 
Nah man, it touches his hand
HOOMAN I DID THE THING
Have seen it over and over again 😍
"Treat?"
I feel like this would be significantly less cute if someone edited the hand out 
Fucking epic! 
My heart just melted :3
So cute! 😄
High five! What a lovely cat. 
Dawww, sweetest mew.
I had the sound on and my cat immediately turned her head back at me all pissed off. 
I played this and my cat came running over. I guess she thought there was another cat in the room.
No it touches your hand
One of my cats immediately jumped up hearing this video, both of them began to search for the mystery kitty as I replayed the video multiple times, then my second cat started getting pissed and slapped the dog. Makes me wonder what video cat was saying.
This 3 sec video *destroyed* my heart 
Reposted lol
That cat is so nice
...and that's all it takes for votes!
It's 9 seconds cuz you have to watch it 3x

That is so cute and so adorable! 😆😁😙😚☺🤗😸😽😹😍😻
he had his claws out. Something tells me this ended differently than this was showing. 
I’ve never said these words in a sentence before, but I think this is the cutest thing I have ever seen in my life.
4 seconds... It's 4 seconds....
I used to do this with my dog. 😢
i need a mirror link please
I normally dislike cats but even I think this is fucking adorable .

Possibly one of the cutest things I've ever seen
So smart little cat!

Wait is your heart in your hand because that cat was giving you a hi-five
This a very complex communication. Only cats do that meaningfully. Dogs do that sometimes, but it seems they only imitate somebody.
Ive watched this 10 times in a row and cant stop smiling.
This a very complex communication, only cats (and perhaps, dogs, but just a little bit) do that. If dogs do that, they do not know what they are doing.
I’m teaching my cat how to do this.
That is one photogenic cat
4 second video

HHNNNNNNNNGG!!!1!!1!!
You should probably see a doctor about that. A glass/metal slab might impair heart or otherwise pulmonary operations, especially if it is in direct contact with the muscular tissue in the heart.

That meow sounds edited in.  Cute though.
Those fucking claws.
Quick! Someone edit the credits to Law and Order to the end of this clip!
