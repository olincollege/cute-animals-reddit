Some folks have all the luck. Baby fox is super cute.
All grandma needs now is a neighbor with a bloodhound puppy and we have the makings of a great movie.
He looks like he has little booties on.
This is just stupid cute
Look at its little blep ‚ù§‚ù§ too cute
Where‚Äôs his mama???
if you're the same person who has a family of them under the shed this is a sure sign you're doomed. The slippery slope to crazy fox person looks steep with cuties like this!
Anyone?  Really?  Ok then, i will do it.

Firefox has encountered a Windows error.
I want to snuggle the biting wild dog.
That is the most adorable thing I've seen all day. It's not a high bar, but still. 

Now I want a fox kit.
I posted an update but I dont know how to link it so... it's on my profile, you can find it there
Blep!
I am having a brain meltdown
needs a little pair of overalls
That‚Äôs the cutest fox I‚Äôve ever seen
That baby blep. How sweet
He wants snacks
Honestly I'm glad this has never happened to me, because I guarantee you I would attempt to pet it and love it forever and probably end up getting bit.
Firefox has encountered a problem with Windows.
Look at that little tongue! Arghhh
I WANT ONE!!!!!
OMG. And he derped you!
Tod! He's so adorable.
üòõ
You better throw a Master Ball at that thing before it gets away quickly
Baby fox doo doo doo doo doo doo
Baby fox, do do do doo doo do do
He even offered the blep of peace. Adorable
Title should have been *heckin smol forest pupper does a blep*
Shut it down. The internet I mean. This will never be topped.
Looks like he showed up to say "neener neener" to me...
I want that fox.
The snozberries taste like snozberries!
Omg this could not be more adorable. Such a cutie faceee
Letting out an audible squueee!!?? As a 30yr old man can sometimes be awkward.

No regerts.
I bet its not his first time showing up at someone's door. Look at the blep little guy is obviously experienced
He do a mlem
I love this friend
I would‚Äôve thought it was a puppy and brought it in lmao
Its melming <3
But what did the fox say?
Oh Granny, what big teeth you've got!
Take em and run
Imma eat your chikins!!!  Blep :p
Weird cat, but okay.
I was walking to my fishing hole today. When I came across two beautiful red foxes. They didn't see me so I whistled.  The bigger one turned and made this barking noise while taking one step towards me, then darting off deeper into the woods. Had my adrenaline pumping a little. That noise and maneuver caught me off guard.
Is he doing a mlem or a blep?
This is hands down the cutest pup of all pups in pup country
Showed up to drop off some SASS
Come my brethren, we will seize this new home as our kingdom!
Hello neighbor .. so if there were some chickens say .. running around.. you'd know where they are right? WHERE ARE THE CHICKENS?
Aww! So cute!!! Your grandma is very lucky.
This is the cutest fucking thing ive ever seen
That is the cutest Fucking thing I've ever seen in my life
Hi nugget!

Let him in let him in
*takes one step closer* fox: *suddenly bares razor sharp teeth and breaks glass*
Welp, that‚Äôs cute as hell. Little Corgi fox

That window licker might not have what it takes to survive... too bad they make awful pets.
C U T E
And that's the Killian experience
mlem
Doesn't look so Big *or* Bad, to be fair.
No it‚Äôs possible that it was baiting the woman to go outside to get eaten by mature foxes
is your grandmother a retired disney princess by any chance?
Todd!
That is an adorable blep
Well.... are you gonna let him in or what?!?
this dude is cuter than my wallet's money
Let the precious baby in :) kidding of course (although I want to boop his little nose)
That‚Äôs a powerful blep
Let him in and raise him as your own
M L E M
Aaaaaaahhhhh
He is super cute!

I hope you said hi back.
cute doggy
awww
Aww
Ahh! I freaking love it! üòç
It doesn‚Äôt want anything, it‚Äôs just a windowlicker.
So... what DOES the fox say?
Mlemmm
I accidentally read that as "a grandmother shows up for sex"
you can practically hear the *\*mlem\**
What a cute little Rabies. Awww ‚ù§Ô∏è
That fox is too perfectly cute. This must be straight out of a cartoon. What sorcery is this.
So I assume you know the saying... where there is a baby there is a mama.... 

If you don‚Äôt see a mama soon you might need to call in some help to raise some babies.
Isnt this the same fox https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/bh3ynf/update_the_baby_fox_at_my_grandmothers_house_has/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

He‚Äôs after lil‚Äô red! üôÄ
This is how Fox and the Hound started.
Baby fox do do dodo dodo
Omg omg omg this is so adorable
If fairy tales have taught me anything,  that fox was there to murder your grandma and steal her identity. You foiled the plan by getting there early Red Riding Hood.
I love that foxes' first instinct upon coming across a window is "An invisible force field! *...I must taste it.*"

Here‚Äôs a photo I took yesterday of the fox babies in our backyard! There are 9 of them :)

Oh God I miss mine.
This isn't normal, is it? It should be scared as hell of you.
r/mlem
I would open the door and scoop him up.
And the derp licks the sliding glass door, exactly like my dog.  Do you know how hard it is to clean dried dog spit off of glass?
That baby fox is so adorable! Did you give him some treats?

Blep
r/furfoxsake
This photo reminds me of a time I was walking to work it was raining in the early morning I saw a baby fox and it noticed me, so the cute bastard started to approach me. My first thought was how cute it was. The second being the scold from the mother fox from out interaction with one another.

As a reaction to my thought process I decided to walk the other way and feel horrible about a fox pup yepling in the rain.

Then of course people made fun of me because it was only a fox.
Even though I know I shouldn't, I just want to cuddle that cutie. üòÇüòç
Oh, it's Micke!
(Edit: oh, its Tod!)

(Don't know if it's another name in other countries.)

Edit: apparently the movie title is "the fox and the hound", in swedish it's their names..
"henlo, u a doggo?"

"neh neh"

"u a catto?"

When I was a child I accidentally pissed on a baby fox once, which is a memory I didn't realize I still had lol
So what did it say?
Rabies
r/blop

Precious little one üíì
So, what does the fox say?
Unpopular opinion: It would be awesome having a baby fox as a pet
Open the door and play with him for fox ü¶ä sake
Just be aware that this is not normal behavior and in some cases can be due to a rabies infection passed down from the mother... as cute as it is don‚Äôt try to pet it. When I was a kid we had a baby fox running up to us right out of the woods. Since the mom wasn‚Äôt anywhere in sight we took it to the vet. Turned out I did actually have rabies...
Least it wasn't a baby shark.... that never leaves you....
Well, what did he say?
> Since they were introduced for recreational hunting in the mid-1800s, foxes have spread across most of
Australia. They have played a major role in the decline of a number of species of native animals. 

I see them occasionally and they are extremely beautiful animals and I don't hold the animals personally responsible for the damage they've caused or believe they should be treated cruelly. But they are wreaking havoc on Australian native species and we have to do whatever we can to eliminate them within Australia.

Can something this cute be real?  It looks like taxidermy.
