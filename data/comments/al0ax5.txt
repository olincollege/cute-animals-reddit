Dog:  "Oh, the Hell with it.  If I get into trouble, I get into trouble."
What a gentle good boy. So sweet. 
"The test. I know, I failed. Sue me. Have you tasted baby face yourself?"
Lol, I feel like I spend a lot of my time at home yelling, ‚Äústop licking the baby! Stop licking the dog!!!‚Äù 
D'aww. When he puts his paws on her leg ü•∞
What a sweet dog.
Babies love dog-licks!!

Source: my son (who will be 2 in May) belly-laughs so hard when our dog attacks him with licks. He follows the dog around to get more licks. The dog is cool with it because the baby shares snacks.
Dog: "You smell important."
*lick my face...lick it.....LICK MY FACE*




Edit: one of my top comments is about licking face... and I‚Äôm ok with that
He tried to be a good boy. How ADORABLE!
NEED SOUND FOR BABY GIGGLES
Baby make friendship.
My niece had quite the opposite reaction when she was a baby. Our dog is a notorious licker (her tongue is HUGE and she loves to use it) and one day my niece (who was a couple months old) was sitting on the floor in our living room. Ellie (our dog) came up behind her and kicked her from the naps of her neck to the top of her head, and my niece let out a scream like we had never heard. Ellie hasn‚Äôt licked another baby since, in spite of being nicknamed ‚ÄúThe Baby Licker‚Äù
Plus, it‚Äôs good for her immune system.
OP what kind of dog is this? I have a very similar mutt and we think she‚Äôs part husky part Jack Russell Terrier.  Yours is like a big version of ours.
If a dog comes up and licks their face that's one thing, but please people don't let the little ones stick their face near a dog's mouth if you can help it.  In an instant their lives can be changed forever. 
Your lucky you have a good boy something along these lines is why i have a scar across my eye and lip from a dog named Macho when i was a baby apparently it didn't want a hug according to my mother.
Great. I have a white German Shepherd identical to that dog and now I have a raging case of baby fever. 
I love my dog. She's a service animal and she's my best friend in the world. She's the kindest, most well behaved dog I've ever known and loves everything that walks (Though she is a bit afraid of kitties).   


I would never let my child put their face to her like that.
You can see him expressing "I have been told not to, tiny hooman!"
My daughter is the same way with my lab.  Unfortunately my lab eats poop ü§Æ
i really wanna lick your face, but momma told me 'NO'!

i love you, little baby - you're my Favrit fren, you know . . . 

there's somethin deep inside that makes me want to do PROTEC

but when you come up close, i wanna lick your face like HECK!

so i'll just watch you here, as you are playing on the floor

oh, here you come, you stinker - yeah, you want my licks some more?!

ok, just don't tell mom, because she thinks that it's the Worst

that's it - here comes the licking - C'mon *MOOMMMM* - She kissed Me FIRST!!




im gonna cry
Dogs are like people, things can go wrong in their heads. A friend of ours had an older golden retriever, family dog since he was a puppy. One day a grand baby came over and was playing with him, he snapped, grabbed her by the face and just started shaking. Fortunately she survived and the scars eventually faded. Just a cautionary tale to point out that even good boys can go bad sometimes.

*EDIT: I love dogs, I have two and they are super lovey.  I kiss my dogs and put my face up to their faces all the time. That being said, I am a grown man and if my dog attacked my face, I am reasonably sure I would survive. An infant is a different story altogether. just be careful with your infants, dogs think differently than humans do, whats loving to us can be a threat to them.
Instead of that try teaching your kid not to headbutt the big ass dog in the face.
He loves his little hooman.
Reddit is a strange place. I believe a month ago someone posted their baby getting doggy licks and everybody gave OP shit for exposing the baby to germs. Now people are praising this OP for helping strengthen the baby's immune system. 
Best dogs ever. I miss my white GSD every day. That‚Äôs one lucky little girl. 
I like how he gets up and stretches like little kids do when you see them about to do something they're not supposed to. Like " what? I'm just stretching" 
Awwww lil sweeties! üíïüíúüíï bffs!
My niece got bitten doing this same thing with their lab that had been in the family for 7 years.  Babies in dogs faces don‚Äôt necessarily mix. 
I once saw a 2 year old gigeling linke crazy while being licked IN THE MOUTH by dogs. This reminds me of that and i dont like it.

When I was a baby, apparently I would share my bottle with my dogs and then drink it. Got a REALLY bad virus that could of killed me (waterfall of blood comin' out of my butthole). I was on antibiotics for months. My parents made sure I never shared shit with my dogs again but they never stopped our dogs from giving us cute kisses. ‚ò∫
And just like that, my ovaries exploded.
This is the sweetest interaction between man and beast I've seen in a long time. 2 of the purest creatures just being what they are. My heart is full, if I had gold I would shower it upon you. 

Edit: Thank you for the silver üòÉ
What a good boy. He clearly loves your daughter.
Her face after she gives up trying vs her face when she finally gets the doggy licks üò≠
Okay... I‚Äôm freaking out a little here.

u/fattyanderson You may never see this amid all the comments, but I have to tell you. When I saw your post title, I chuckled because it sounded just like the struggle I have with one of my dogs and my son. Then, I watched the gif and my brain exploded. Your dog and my dog look goddamn near identical.

[See for yourself.](https://imgur.com/a/9dOi8EI)

It wasn‚Äôt just the physical resemblance, it was the mannerisms too. How gentle he *can* be. 

Crazy. I just had to share. 
I feel it's good for the babies immune system.
Sorry if someone else has asked already, but what kind of dog is he?
Children and animals are always so cute! 

Hate to be the negative post about dogs licking children's faces. But here are just two reasons not to allow this with your dogs and children. 

Animal mouths harbor a multitude of bacterial strains. They frequently, eat garbage and feces, they lick their backsides and genitals. When a dog licks a baby‚Äôs mouth, nose or eyes, there is the potential for harmful organisms to enter the baby‚Äôs system. This can also occur when the dog licks the baby‚Äôs feet or hands too, when the baby then goes onto suck on them.

dogs lick their own and other dog‚Äôs backsides, stick their noses in fecal material and occasionally eat feces. This puts them at risk for contracting worms and other intestinal parasites that can be transmitted to humans. Those of greatest concern are [Roundworms](http://www.petsandparasites.org/dog-owners/roundworms/) and [Cryptosporidium](https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/index.html). 

##  
Attempts have been made to boop the snoot but good boi does not allow. 
This is so so pure. My heart. 

Also, children exposed to "gentle" germs such as dogs, dirt, dust, mud, and other outside things at an early age are less likely to develop allergies and more likely to have a strong immune system (according to studies).
I've spent the last year telling my son not to lick the dog.....
God that made me nervous. I've been around dogs my entire life, but I would never let this happen. 
Kinda cute... But am I the only one here who thinks dog licks are disgusting... Like.. ew
Is that a jindo?? I have one too!!
My in laws have a dog who just loves my infant son. No matter how many times you tell the dog not to lick his face and ears she always does it and my son just giggles or pats her on the head. It's so sweet.

The dog has a meltdown of she is in proximity of my son and has not yet had the opportunity to lick his face and/or ears.
Constant battle with my 1 year old right now. He loves the kisses from the dogs üò¨. 
I mean really...good boye receives barrage of kisses from cute little girl...smooching back is impulsive as it is deserved.
"But MOM. You expect me to say no to this face???"
Omg.  I love big dogs.  I vaguely remember being a tiny kid and looking up to a big ol collie and being SO HAPPY.  Worst thing about being an adult.  You can never stand up and look up to a dog.
**When my dog did not lick the face of my baby I discovered after a while that my child was trying to lick the face of my dog**
"This is a test, isn't it?"

"......."

"Aw, screw it"

"Wurfth"
"Hey, I won't be here forever, so imma make these young years count. "

*slobber slobber lick protect*
Looks like a German Shepard. I too have a white German Shepherd, and all the shedded hair to go with it.
That dog would die to protect that baby. Such a good boy
Is this a white German Shepard?
18 years ago we brought our son home, committed to keeping the 2-year-old dog away. Dog got close and we said "well, certainly no sniffing". Dog sniffed and we said "well, no licking". Dog licked and we said "don't lick the face". Dog licked the face and we drew a hard line at the mouth. We gave up shortly after hearing ourselves say "the dog is definitely not allowed to lick the inside of the baby's mouth".
Entire progression took about a week. Dog and boy were best friends until dog died at ripe old age of 14. He was a good Boi. 
Ok reddit veterinarians. How many diseases did this baby contract and how long does she have until she's dead
Honestly, that's all anyone ever really wants.

&#x200B;
Sooooo cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
r/lickthedamnbaby
Cant this be dangerous for small children? 
Can someone explain the phenomenon of putting those flowery headbands on baby girls? Is it purely to make the baby look more "girly" since they don't have long hair yet?
Yuck
A few dog butt germs never hurt anyone.
Sweet babies 
Awwww that's such an adorable smile
What a good dog!  This is the sweetest. 
It's only gonna get worse, OP.
Its amazing the dog definitely knows. He see's she's upset and goes and licks her anyway. 
Good bad boy
I wouldn't mind it so much if my daughter would just SHUT HER MOUTH when she badgers the dog for a kiss. Nothing quite as disturbing as watching your 1 year old daughter French kiss the dog.
just give him all the shots, check for vermin and brush his teeth and tongue.
my kids lick the dog. sigh.
My Corgi's way of interacting with the world around him is mostly by barking.  Especially at new stuff.  Sometimes licking it.  Anyway, first time I brought him to Xmas eve dinner at my grandma's after my cousin had her twins... I think they were like 7 months old at the time.  I was so afraid to introduce him to them because I just knew he'd bark at them, scare them, cause a crying fit.  Well, it happened... he was checking them out cautiously, gave them a couple little licks on their hands... then started sniffing at their chest/neck... pause... looks them right in the face ***FUCKIN BARK***.  Kid pulls his head back, startled.  I'm thinking, oh god, here we go.  Kid starts cracking up.  Both twins thought it was fuckin hilarious.  Twins are like 4 years old now and totally obsessed with my dog when I come home for the holidays.  All three of them hang out under the dinner table and chat after they finish eating.
White German Shepherds represent!
I watched this three times in a row. What a good, sweet boy he is. And how lucky she gets to have a buddy to snuggle! The cutest
I think this might be the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen 
Pure and simple this made me smile üòä
What breed is this dog?
He‚Äôs actually a white German Shepherd...looks very similar and gets people confused all the time.
Someone pat that good boy on the head for me plz!
The dog is thinking, "no lyk, no lyk"
Hey, little one, your dad told me no!

"Cmon pup!"

Awe who am i kidding, your my new owner.
Omg so sweet
So much sweetness!
this baby has the most genuine and beautiful smile I've seen in my life.

that lick REALLY brought some happiness it seems 
‚ÄúYou know I cannot lick. Why u taunt me like this‚Äù
That is the cutest thing I think I've ever seen.
I have a white gsd with a red collar too! I had to do a double take üòÜ
Warms my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è 
That boy would fight a lion to protect that baby
Awwww. Show her this when she‚Äôs old enough to realize who her first best friend was. 
MY HEART IS GONE. IT MELTED
This is beautiful and made me smile, thanks. And...  
That's one of the best anti-depressants ever!
baby faces are covered in food, great place to lick
Guess her germs are ok with his germs they‚Äô'll be bff too. Aww
Aww, what a good doggo. This is adorable and your baby is gorgeous! 
good boy points have reached maximum level
r/boopthesnoot
this made my day!
THE BABY JUST WANTS TO BOOP SNOOTS
Wholesome 
This is me on a daily basis with two high energy dogs and a 11 mth 
The goodest boy
My white shepherd was also a very sweet and gentle giant with kids
We don't deserve dogs.  They are far too noble to be associated with us.
She's going to love dogs for the rest of her life all because of that good boy. 
THIS TINY THING IS NOW A WOLF EVERYBODY
OH MY GOODNESS. OUR DOGS ARE TWINS. 
I had a white gsd when my girls were babies, the best dog so great with kids. 
Probably killing him on the inside...want to lick...want to lick. Fake stretch..LICK!!!!!
The best Boi. I feel like having a dog when you have a kid is must. It‚Äôs like a 24/7 body guard.  
My ovaries literally just exploded
cutie pie
What Kind Of Dog is This 
I love the stretch that happens to put his mouth right by her face!  My dogs are very good at this move near our babies face or a plate on the coffee table with food on it.  "oh whoops this is quite the coincidence my face is here, would sure be a shape if I accidentally licked something I wasn't supposed to!"
The germs r good for her tho 
White Shepards are such great dogs
Dogs are angels.
He is so gentle closing his eyes whenever her headband poked him in the eyes, but still remaining gentle. 

Dogs are such good friends to people-- this interaction makes my heart cry. 
I knew a German Shepard just like this one once. She was my wonderful librarian‚Äôs and her name was Luna. Such a sweetie, just like yours :)
If it makes you feel better, babies who grow up with pets have stronger immune systems and tend to have less food allergies. I'd send a link but I have issues with my browser on my phone. I believe if you Google it you'll find so my info/proof.
I'm really glad this didn't end before she got a kiss.
That little girl is an instigator. Gonna get all her friends in trouble xD
Dogs are the best. That is all. ‚ù§Ô∏è
We tried for months to get our dog to stop licking our baby's face, but he is just like the baby in the OP; if he doesn't get his licks voluntarily, he goes to get them by *force*. Now we just try our best to limit it.

I will say that the most adorable thing in my life right now is telling our 1.5yr old "it's bedtime!" - first order of business is to come give me a hug and a kiss, *then* it's time to find the dog wherever she may be so he can grab her face and kiss her snout while she licks him.

The cat just gets a squeal. Baby knows cat doesn't care for baby hugs, and cat knows that baby **has** to say goodnight. They have a pretty good, albeit less adorable system.
Looks like you've lost that battle.  <3  (It could be worse, though. When my son was about that age, he'd stick his tongue out for the dog to lick.)
Now time teach her not put her face in the dog's face. 
And yet people treat these animals like fucking dirt. We really dont deserve dogs. #factsonly
That stretch before just incase he‚Äôs got to make a quick zoomie 
This is the cutest boop I've seen to date 
I was babysat as a kid by a family with a big, old Alsatian. I have quite vivid memories of 3 year old me yanking on his ears, pulling his tail, and following him around the house as he sighed and took all the abuse. What I *don't* remember is my habit of falling asleep in his dog bed, or my dad being threatened by the dog who positioned himself in front of me and growled everytime dad came to pick me up. I was his little human charge.
That‚Äôs great for their immune system!  No allergies hooray!
We lost our WGS two weeks suddenly to a ruptured tumor we were unaware of. He was a big a boy but so gentle with kids and this brought all kinds of tears to my eyes. Thanks for sharing.

edit: spelling
There‚Äôs nothing better than the relationship between a human and their dog 
The goodest good boy!
This warmed my cold dead heart 
This is the poster video of why dogs are awesome and why every kid should have one in their family.
He's being soooooo good: "I will not kiss baby, Mama said no...but baby is sad now. Can't I please give her a kiss too?  I can?? OK!"  Bet that's the last time Mama says no!
Do not recommend! This is dangerous as fuck. Never let a child get face to face with a dog. This is soooo stupid.
It's actually good the ol' immune system to be exposed to large pets. 
He tried to be a good boy. How ADORABLE!
While you're sitting here watching this remember: The bacteria that are currently in your mouth aren't genetically related to your family at all. Not your mother or father. They're direct biological descendants to the bacteria living in the anus of your pet growing up. 
Thats the sweetest 
I question the intelligence of people who allow this.
That is the sweetest thing. 

My son is 6 and has adhd and anxiety. He‚Äôs always been deathly afraid of dogs (and everything else!) so I decided to get a puppy a few months ago and it has been so amazing for him. Both of them I hope. 
Please be careful.  You dog can pass parasites and other diseases to your baby because their immature immune system.
Does anyone else get really nervous when kids are around animals?
Fucking gross man lol unpopular opinion and all that but that dog has licked the worst things you can find on the way to the park and he's licking the baby's face. 

OP would you let a relative lick your baby's mouth and face too? 

Muh kusses though... Jesus Christ
On a serious note please be really careful I've heard so many stories of babies getting dangerously poorly just from being kissed by someone with a cold sore (herpes virus) frightened me to death when we had our baby. Sorry for sounding so negative.
Is it bad for babies to have their faces licked by dogs? I‚Äôve always allowed it
We love our dogs, and so does our daughter. I've never understood though why people let their dogs lick their faces etc. Especially a baby with an immature immune system. But your dog is so well behaved!!! Congrats.
Oh, this made me tear up for some reason. What a sweet good boy, I love how happy she is after her face gets licked :')
HEY!  THATS MY DOG!  http://imgur.com/bqmCmlL
Yeah that seems healthy... 
What a good, good boy! 

Also, this is literally how my son used to call the dog when he was an infant. 
They turned it into a game. I would prop him up in his boppy pillow so he was sitting up and he would look at the dog and open his mouth as a signal to her to come lick his face. 

Kid: opens mouth

Dog: runs by; licks baby's face/inside of mouth(!); keeps running to other side of room, waits and watches kid

Kid: giggles; opens mouth again

Dog: repeats earlier action from other direction

Kid: laughs even harder, opens mouth again
[Repeat with kid escalating hilarity and dog working harder and harder to control her excitement so she doesn't hurt the baby.]

This game could buy me a good 20 minutes of folding laundry on the couch while being almost as entertained as they were. 

Within a month or two, they changed it a bit: instead of licking his face, the dog started nipping his hands. I was mortified at first, but son laughed his head off, there was never a mark on him, and he wanted the game to continue that way.

Soon is grown now, but still refers to that dog (who passed away over a decade ago) as his second mom. Not much of a compliment to me, but that was one _fabulous_ dog.

Congratulations and enjoy these fun times!

I don‚Äôt even like babies or kids but that was adorable. And that dog is such a sweetie. Dogs are the greatest thing in the world 
I don't understand why people get dogs and expect them not to lick you.

They're dogs. That's how they show affection. Sure, you can train them to NOT lick you, which is basically training them to stop showing you affection.

They do this also as a sign of respect, and love for other dogs. Showing them to shake, roll over, play dead, or any other bullshit only teaches them you will reward them if they comply with one of your commands. Gee, now that's loving your pet. You have a slave that does shit at your command, woo-hoo!
annnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd i'm dying. this is so sweet <3 
Disgusting. Why are you letting a dog lick your baby's face? Also, people who kiss their dogs on the lips are mentally ill. 
As much as people hate dogs that lick, I try not to take that away from them. It's like telling a human not to hug or smooch. Instead, train your dog to *control* their licking. For example, my dog knows it's okay to give me a few little licks under my chin, unless I signal that I'm game for all-over-face-licks (which I do right before I hop in the shower). It makes it so your dog can still express their joy and affection in the way that dogs do those things, but that they can't get all over the top about it because we simply don't like to have the insides of our mouths cleaned out by a giant tongue.

It's not so bad when they do some little licks under the chin, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like being licked. I'm just willing to compromise because they're people too. ;)
That is too adorable!!!
Nothing like getting licked by a tongue that just finished cleaning its own asshole
Is there any benefit to stopping dog licks on the baby? I kinda assumed it would be a benefit to expose the baby to some harmless bacteria
I am not an 'animal person', but that made me want a dog. 
I *INSULT* you, to your *FACE*
This looks like such a damn good dog. Love him. Baby is darling. 
Haha the dog sneaked upto her right at the moment the kid started playing hard to get! So adorable :')
I have a 7 month old and we're currently trying to teach our very old boxer not to lick his face. Which is tough, since they both love it.
That's cute as hell.
Omg this is too cute!!!!! Her little smile awwwwww 
That's a good dog and a better baby.
Oh ..my ..god, the dog really tried but couldn't, so cute <3 
This just melted my cold heart 
I am smushed. That is so adorable. 
That's like waving a beer in front of a recovering alcoholic's face.
That's so fucking cute. They love each other so much!
My heart is so warm watching this.
Ah man. I spent the last few minutes before work hanging with my wife, 3 month old son, and dog. Getting out the door this morning was not easy. 
This is so precious
ADORABLE üòç
What a lovely gentle dog :)
I just want to add that the dog positioned himself so he can't be seen licking her face. 
My god you have a well behaved dog
I try to get out but they keep pulling my back in!
That's friggin' adorable.
ITT: Anecdotal evidence stacked on top of anecdotal evidence.
aww
So sweet. The restraint! And instantly, when she's unhappy, the placating behavior.. that stretch, then the licking.. Reminds me SO much of my Podenco Canario mix. Is that breed or a mix? Do you know what breeds? Because apart from the fur color, they even look very much alike.

&#x200B;
I DOUBLE DOG DARE YA!!!
What breed is it?
I like how he hid from the camera before he started to lick her.
She looks exactly like my dog, only my dog doesn't have straight upward ears 
Lol so cute
Funny how the dog says ‚Äúwelp, fuck it...gonna lick‚Äù....then hesitates
Meanwhile I‚Äôve spent the last 4 years telling my dog not to chase the cats and it still does, constantly, all day, it never stops
There is just something about a dog that could literally kill you, but does this kind of stuff instead. üíï
Ofcourse let him get those licks in!!!! Man that was the cutest thing ever. They‚Äôre best friends, can‚Äôt wait to have a kid so my dog could be friends with them. I hope so anyways lol. 
She's almost screaming for his licks
Oh...my heart! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Omg. Sooo cute!
OMG I can't with this cuteness. I have to go lie down for a while till these bluebirds stop flying around my head.
So sweet!!!!
I want to die this is so fucking sweet.
Heart warmed. 
Oh my ‚ù§Ô∏èüíú
Roses are red

Violets are blue

Ill be a good boi

Heck! I will lick you face too!
Good dog!
Alright everyone. On three. One... two... AAAWWWWWW
Good boy, have an upvote. 
We lost out white GSD last summer, looked JUST like the dog in the video... now I'm happy and sad at the same time... 
Do all dogs lay on slippers like that?  I've had two dogs and they both did/do that.
This makes me so happy!
Aww this is sooo sweet. This made my day
Melts my ‚ù§Ô∏è
Awe the look of disappointment in her face
:(
anecdotal I know but it matches with some studies that have been done...

I spent the first 3 years of my life with a dog who my mom said would lick my face all the time.  At first she would stop him but after a while she said she just gave up because I laughed when it happened.   

I'm currently 35 and the last time I had a fever above 99 was the 2008 superbowl.  I remember because my roommates quarantined me to my room during the game because I had a bad case of bronchitis, was coughing like crazy, and had a 102 fever.  I also remember it because it was when the Patriots didnt come away with the perfect season.  

So its been 11 years since I've had a fever above 99 and 11 years since I've had to take antibotics for being sick.  

So let you dog lick your kids face as much as he wants because, in my experience, it can only benefit the kids immune system in the long run. 
Awww kisses!
/u/vreddit_bot
Very good boi, 11/10, would let him lick my face
White GSD!!!
The doggie loves his sister
More. MORE!!! I need more videos of these two! They are so cute. He cares about her so much. 
Look at the affection on that face. My heart is melting.
This is greaaat! üòùüòù
While training the dog not to lick, you made one critical mistake. Dogs are easier to train than babies.
MY DAUGHTER DOES THIS SAME EXACT THING üôÑ lol she loves getting slobbery dog kisses üòÖ
Goddamn, dogs are great!
This melted my heart! Hes such a good, gentle boy & she's just fricken adorable :) 
Omg yes!  So sweet.
Again, posts this cute should really come with a warning. It took me some time to collect myself from the puddle I had melted into after seeing this, and I needed the warning to brace myself! Who‚Äôm I kidding? I‚Äôd have melted anyway.
Gentle giant :)
Falalalalala kiss da girl!
As a person who doesn't own pets, how easy is it to train them to do certain things like not licking a certain object/person?
I'm so upset this doesn't have sound :(
I have this exact breed that I've always wondered what it was. Turns out the breed was just "adorable"
So cute! It's like they're exchanging kisses!
Your boy looks/acts so much like my girl! 
That dog's mouth is lieekly cleaner than hers. 
"Why do you tempt me human?"
Dog just declared alpha over the pack because baby too cute to follow orders.
So sweet! We have cats and, with the exception of one, they were all indifferent bastards when our son was little. 
I want to hear the giggle!
Dogs only want one thing...
Wolves lick faces to show their affection
Fatty, i need to tell you, your dog doesn't speak human.
When he stand ups.

'Let me show you how it's done, child'
Schnoodledoodledoo needs to see this...immediately
The dog is like I lick you but don‚Äôt tell her
I'm glad the good boy gets to do what he wants too.... was kinda sad watching him lay there. pure happiness at the end though.
the way it approached, reminded me of a grandparent. 
What breed is that dog? Looks identical to mine and the dna test my friend got me for her was useless. They offered me my money back haha
That dog looks so much like my boy! üòçü•∞
That's so cute! What kind of Shepard is that? I have an identical puppy and didn't know exactly what she was.
Adorable!!!
So cute! Thanx for the smile.
Awww so sweet he wants to oblige his folks but wants to oblige the little one tooü•∞üòò
That's cute 
This is how my son and my dog Shelby is. She was just under a year old when he was born. I can‚Äôt wait to see how their relationship develops as he grows older. 
This is my new go to eye bleach after I read or watch anything political!

He looks like a big version of my dog ‚ù§Ô∏è
His restraint is admirable, but nobody can expect him to withstand that invitation.
Notice that he's licking the edge of the mouth, which is a sign of submission. :)
I wonder if dogs think baby humans are cute in the same way we think baby dogs are cute
I've seen some cute shit in my days. This might be the cutest of cute shit

This is the best.
What a plot twist
Best thing I've seen all week. So considerate and respectful of each other. I wish them both a long, loving and adventurous life! Congrats on your little family OP!
Welp, they‚Äôre best friends now, and forever will be
That is one good dog. 
How does one teach baby to just hang out nicely? My daughter wants to grab my dogs hair and tail when shes this close
OMG the self control! Such a good boi and fresh peachy squish! <3 <3 

I'm dead. #SheDed
BEST BOYE
I can‚Äôt say that I blame her.
Why not lick the babies face?
*Dog FBI* ‚ÄúLaddies and gentlemen, we gottem‚Äù üóø
Your video of your pretty baby and wonderful dog has made my day. WHich issaying a lot as I am on vacation in the Bahamas right now! THank you!
My heart
Dog: Am I a joke to you?
Good dog
Kiss me you fool!
UPVOTE HARDER

Awwwwww
Dog attempts malicious compliance... breaks after 5 seconds.
That doggo is in love.
Trying so hard to be a good boi 
My heart a splode
My niece & nephew LOVE getting kisses from Mimi & Papa's dogs! It's their main goal in life, I think. My niece (2) acts shocked every time and like she's grossed out but she goes right back for more lol
I was so upset. I thought it was a lost cause and ye ruined it- but it all turns round in the end!
our dog does the same to our son and he even walks over to the dog occasionally to kiss him too. 
I think dogs display a type of love you rarely ever get from a person.
GOOD BOY ALERT
super cute!
Cute.....

Master says I cant......screw it, what's the worst could happen.  That's awesome, love how obedient he is.
My grandma's dog had a command called "Kiss the baby!" and she'd find the nearest grandkid and just go to town. Let him kiss the baby!!
Cuteness overload!!! 
The bestest boy. 
He is so happy he can finally lick her!
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen! Aaaaaw!
I am tearing up now. 
Tan shepherd gang!

I can‚Äôt even explain how adorable I find this to be 
Wat een gvd lief beest
I can't even, this is too cute to take!!
What kind of dog is this?
Made my morning :) 
While this is cute please remember everyone that a dog may not like this behavior and all dogs have a mouth with teeth. If your child invades theor space or does something like hug or kiss or pull on them they can and will react to remove the child from their space. Be careful.

From a dog owner 
My heart just melted ü•∞üíú
My 1 year old daughter laughs and coos so loudly when my ferrets touch her face with their wet nose. She's started giving them big hugs after they sniff/lick her and she makes the same sounds as when she's snuggling her blanket. Only took two times of me telling her to be gentle and she is every time now. (I know because I'm holding the ferrets when she hugs them and I can feel how hard she's squeezing them.)
I want more of that.
that is the sweetest thing I have seen in quite a while 
We've now seen enough. Please tell him he's allowed to lick. 
Let them do their shit, them two are nature at its purist :-) they won't fuck it up üëç
\#Capnocytophaga\_Canimorsus 
This is very adorable. What a gentle, sweet dog.
That small lip raise, though...
Ehhh, fecking gross?  r/unpopularopinion?
Why would you ever tell him not to lick her face? That‚Äôs cruel.
That is absolutely adorable. I love the interaction between our best friend ( dogs ) and babies. There is just a special connection, so often. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzZQYnvw-6E
does anyone know what breed this is?
I watched this three times in a row.  Anyone beat my score?
Too cute.
OMG!!! Tooo cute ,what a beautiful baby
Also very impressed with how gentle the baby is with the dog! Very sweet. 
I want sound!

That's fucking gross.
Don't underestimate your kid's immune system - now is when it needs to come into contact with all that stuff. Overprotection = allergies
Cleaning babys face right after eating different kind of shits
Betcha pupper does it all the time when mum and dad isn‚Äôt around. But with mum and camera there he was SUCH  a good pupper. 
I'm not sure what it is with some dogs and licking babies faces. Maybe it's because they are so low to the ground that it becomes an easy target.

My dog definitely has the taste for baby too. Whenever we go to a dog park with a playground she darts right over to the nearest baby and licks their face of.
Gotta love the white Germans 
My favorite part of this video is watching the dog side eye the videographer. The dog knows what the baby wants, but also doesn‚Äôt want to get scolded. So what does he do? Puts his back between the baby and camera so he can maybe giver her some good licks without/before getting caught!!! This made my whole day ‚ú®üíñ‚ú®
Brb I need to punch a wall
What type of dog is this? It looks identical to mine but the human society couldn't tell us a breed? 
Omg that is so pure and sweet. I needed that. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Poor thing. I bet he wants to too but knows better since he doesn't want to go against you. Bless him. 
I'm not crying, u crying 
I hope OP put this in r/eyebleach 
Why am I crying?  Jesus thanks hormones!
This is a very Good Boy.
This is the cutest darn thing I ever saw ‚ô•
My white german shephard wants nothing more than to like my face so I can imagine this good boy had a hard time holding back!
Oh God, I‚Äôve watched this about 15 times, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna be stuck here all day watching this adorable interaction! This is amazingly cute! 
It should be illegal to post videos like this without sound
Such a good pup
"Yeah, okay, whatever. I'm licking her face."
::Runs home to give dog a hug::
Awww, he‚Äôs like: ‚Äògrrrl, you gon get my ass beat,... awww.. wth, you‚Äôre so freakin cute, I don‚Äôt even care, (licks baby) who loves you baby ?‚Äô üíï!!!


So wholesome ‚ù§Ô∏è
Let them be
Mom said not to.. I can't! Stop asking, I really can't!  Okay:);)
I love dogs. We don't deserve them. 
He‚Äôs showing love and will protect her
Is there health risks in a dog licking a baby, assuming your not anti vax...
The bacteria are good for the kid. 
Is this your dog??? Where did you get him? My dog looks remarkably similar and has similar mannerisms. When I got him, he was in the cage with his brother and sister but they were both spoken for, otherwise I would have gotten all three of them!
I wouldn‚Äôt be worried if my pupper licked my child‚Äôs face, maybe not after they‚Äôve eaten or something lol.
Such a sweet baby, and a good dog
r/lickthedamnbaby
Lol! The temptation is too great
I love this so much.
pupper kisses :)
It‚Äôs a travesty there isn‚Äôt sound to this gif. 
That‚Äôs a good boy!! ‚ô•Ô∏è
My 4 year old nephew screams with joy when my dog gives him kisses. 
OMG , cutest thing I saw today.
Babies love licks as much as dogs, our Staffy‚Äôs tongue is so long 
Heart melted. Smile on my face. Thanks for sharing! This is precious!
That child will have a strong immune system.

&#x200B;
this could be a commercial. we just need a voice over
I fucking love dogs
Awww so cute!! What kind of dog is he?
Ok I‚Äôve got my dose of absolutely adorable for the day :) 
Aww that's one of the cutest things I've ever seen
It‚Äôs Bolt in real life 
I hope you understand how completely awesome this dog is! The best dissed of boys!
this is too adorable
I agree with her. Doggy kisses are the best. I feel sad when they don't give me one. 
I CANT FUCKING TAKE IT ANYMORE I NEED A GODDAMN DOG FUCKCKCKCCKCKKCCKKCCKKCCKCKCKCKKCCK
Unbelievably adorable 
The goodest!
r/lickthedamnbaby
My heart! I tell my dogs not to lick my baby‚Äôs face too, but after this, I‚Äôll let them do what they want. 
Doggie knew. 
Oh I love dogs. She is such a sweet little girl. 
awww how adorable. I love them
She is my new human now, I listen to her and her alone
This is beyond cute. I watched it 5 times. 
Idk if thats carma or just your luck lol
I feel a wee bit sorry for him though, he must be feeling torn between wanting to do it and thinking he's going to get told off again. 
My son as well! We have gently reminded my little dog not to lick my sons face. Hes a toddler now and all he wants is doggy kisses. He does the same, but with his mouth open for maximum kissing üôÑüòÜ
This is probably wise. I had a beagle growing up, he would lick you until you laughed, then pin you down and irrigate your sinuses with his tongue.
do you think that dog thinks babies are cute
Looks like a white German shepherd I had named Princess. She would obsessively lick my sister's face even when she got older. We got her the same year my sister was born so they grew up together.
That's soooo sweet!

Id give this a Gold if i had the money
The cutest thing I'll see all day today.
This is the cutest thing EVER. 
My heart almost burst from the cuteness üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è
This is so cute
I love how he braced for impact just before the little headbutt! He's a very good boy, never ceases to amaze me how good dogs are with babies. They're an awesome species!
That‚Äôs what my mutt does with my grandson. Never tries to bite; but when he‚Äôs had enough, he‚Äôll just get up and leave.
Cute <3
Where is the sound?:)
I love the way the baby seems to understand the correct way to communicate with the dog to get what she wants. 
awww puppyyyyy
Good boy!! 
This makes me so sad that I lost my good boy when my daughter was just a few months old. I desperately want her to have a companion pup but I am scared that getting one would feel like I was replacing my Bailey.  
I am having a lousy, lousy day - this is just what I needed to get me through til 5:00! 

What a sweet and beautiful sight üòä
what type of dog?
Awwwwüòçüê∂
Dog pill
Doggo couldn't resist 
This actually made me aww
parenting issues i feel sorry for dog
This is what I‚Äôm here for. 
11/10 the bestest boy!
So precious 
I'm pretty sure that doggo was just defending its master's slipper.
The greates boy there is
‚ÄúMaybe if I give him more sweet kisses... yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll do‚Äù
This is so cute. He tried so hard to resist but in the end he just couldn‚Äôt :-)
Aww is an understatement 
So. So. So. Cute.
"Enough of this shit! I'm gonna do it and you can't stop me!"
r/eyebleach
Both love each other 
Wow that warmed the cockles of my cold dead heart.
She booped da snoot
He's like "you're trying to get me in trouble, aren't you?"

&#x200B;
This is the sweetest thing I've seen in my entire life. I like to imagine that he's just dying inside resisting the urge to lick because he wants to beagoodboy, and finally - off camera - he gets an "it's okay!" and an orchestra kicks in as he gives her kisses and she giggles.
WHAT. A. GOOD. BOY.
I LOVE this! üòç
What breed of dog is this?  Her face is very similar to a wonderful mutt I use to have.
This is absolutely adorable.
My üíì has melted. üòç
This warms my heart so much and I don't know why
Anyone else notice doggos slipper pillow? 
This may be one of the cutest things I've ever seen
This. Made my crappy day a little better. 
Wow!! Just like at our house; 10 month old and a German Shepherd/Husky. They even all look alike üòå so sweet. 
Awh the cute pair
My daughter loves dogs. Her Great Grandmother has to big dogs who are very gentle with her. The only issue is she loves to pretend to be a dog so when they come in for kisses, she tries to kiss them back tongue out and all. She knows she isn't supposed to but thinks she's sneaky.
Too damn cute!!!
What type of dog do you have? It looks exactly like mine 
Fucking hell humans don't deserve dogs
Babies LOVE getting licked in the face by pups!
This is my child as well!

I‚Äôm having a shitty day, and this just made me smile. A much needed smile. 
The thing I love about this subreddit is that I don't realize I'm on a /r/aww post until I say "awww" out loud and instantly check to confirm.
My girl loves to lock the baby inside their ears. She a Maltese so she's little and the babies have all loved it. 
Stop. Cuteness overload
God damnit I love dogs
I wish I could hear her giggles! This is just too cute
He wuv her.
A wolf imprints on people why can‚Äôt a dog lol
Needs sound üò©
My dog is not a licker. My brother's Boston terrier is. My 2 year old ADORES this dog licking her face and has since she was very little. We often have to separate them, lol.
Too adorable. dogs, gosh.
Sorry if someone else has asked already, but what kind of dog is he?
What did we do to deserve such pure hearted animals, dogs are the salt of this earth.
My heart!!! ü•∞üòçü•∞
Had a dog who looked just like this one. Good memories.
Well done, both babies look happy and comfortable ‚ò∫Ô∏è
He looks so depressed before he gets up to lick her.
Wow you hecking monster! jk
It‚Äôs so cute it hurts.
/r/lickthedamnbaby
Oh what nice friends!!
ITT: Anecdotal evidence
Saves time on bath! 
The older I get the more my heart softens to stuff like this. Help me. 
The one thing I am most proud of having taught my dog is to only lick faces on command, and that command is puckered lips and a kissy sound. 

She doesn‚Äôt always understand when it‚Äôs not being directed at her, though.
He claimed her as his. Licking of the face and lips area is a sign of submission. Although paw over the leg is, if done intentionally a sign of dominance. Regardless that's for sure is baby's lifelong protector.

I do love how aware of things Shepherds are, he knew to close his eyes and stay still for the baby's moves. I am partial to white Shepherds however as I have 2 so can't say I'm biased 
Dogs are the best.
He thinks he‚Äôs looking after her
What breed is this? 
What a gentle giant
What breed is this?
They know what's best. They'll lead, you just follow. This is the cutest thing I've seen on reddit. 
This is beautiful...
/u/justalittlecomment 
Cuteness overload!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This is so stinking cute!!!
Whew, I was SO close to thinking that was a baby boy.  Glad you put that headband on her.  Dodged a bullet there.  
Puppy sugars I find are the best medicine I find. That and amoxicillin 
I wish it had sound so I could hear her laugh!!
Lol our daughter is three months old and we are constantly telling our pit bull not to try and lick her üòÇ
Awww, no audio? But... But... Baby giggles!!!! üò≠
Such a good dog!
This is so stinking cute!!!! I kiss my dog all the time and I let her lick my face. I don‚Äôt let her get all in my mouth (yuck) but she‚Äôs a very affectionate little girl.

That being said, she‚Äôs little (a Pomeranian) so kids run up and want to pet/snuggle/kiss her all the time. I really wish parents would teach their kids to ASK. My dog‚Äôs very, very, very good with kids but she could get very well be spooked by something one day. 
Stupid question why dogs love to lick a face but why tho
Omg! Soooo cute!
This is perfect
[deleted]
Not sure who‚Äôs kisses are the sweetest! Great video! 
Dog "No tiny human, not this time. I'm sorry."
My grandfather thought it was always very good for a baby to grow up in a house with dogs. "Dogs mouth has good germs" he would say. "Makes you strong". Apparently my dad had nappy rash as a baby and the dog licked his butt (because he was running around without a diaper, due to the rash and his rash cleared right up..... lol 
Siblings for life.
You wantda da licks? I givva da licks 
Babies and puppies and not a link to the original video in sight. What is a person to do to get a fix of baby gigglesounds around here?
thanks for sharing such a good one.. can you please let us know the breed of the dog..
My kid does this. Runs over to the pupper ‚ÄúBUBBA LICK ME BUBBA LICK ME‚Äù. Dog looks at me like... dude wtf you specifically tell me not to do that.
My heart!! Love of every kind Must Have Licks!!

This is so innocent it can cure me of my sins
So sweet
Beautiful doggo and kiddo! What kind of dog is that? 
That‚Äôs adorable.
Good dog
Babies love licks as much as dogs, our Staffy‚Äôs tongue is so long 
Babies are frequently snack-coated
Omg that dog is like a copy of mine when he was younger..
This is actually crazy
Just found this... OMG ! If you had seen what can happen if a dog licks a baby you would not be letting your dog anywhere near the baby, never mind their face.  Its up to the dog owner to police this, not the dog. Stop your babies getting anywhere near the dog's mouth, not least of which they could bite, but the germs in a dog's mouth can cause horrendous infections for baby, and on the face can lead to life changing scars. Please don't allow this, I know it looks cute and baby is chortling away, dog isn't aggressive but the germs on its wee tongue could disfigure your baby. 
this is adorable <3
I was seriously okay with not having children until I saw this. Serious baby fever now. üò´
This is the most adorable thing I‚Äôve seen here...
Who else was thinking "you lick that god damn baby's face right now"
is it okey to let the dog lick your daughter's fcae 

for me i think i am not okay with that may be if my daughter gets little bit older 

that's will be good for her health
its gross. teach her not to let any dog do this, its sick
People always get so mad when I do this
This actually helps strengthen your child‚Äôs immune system. As she‚Äôs exposed to pathogens her immune system will a develop resistance towards that certain bacteria. Hence why the cleanest of people are most prone to being allergic to dogs and cats. 
How could there be a cuter video???
I'M DEAD
Another best boi on
Reddit
Sadly, there‚Äôs a group of people on here that would say this is borderline child abuse because you‚Äôre letting your dog lick the kids face. 

This is such a sweet moment! Nothing better than your dog giving you love. 
Dog licks balls, dog licks babies face and mouth. Lovely. 
It‚Äôs probably good for the baby‚Äôs immune system. 
PURE JOY FOR THE BOTH OF THEM! 
That dog‚Äôs going through torture
The warmth in my heart from this post could melt the Kuiper Belt.
Can confirm. Have both a 5 year old German Shepherd and a 16 months old daughter. It‚Äôs a daily struggle! But he LOVES his tiny human and I love how gentle he is with her. We are very lucky.
