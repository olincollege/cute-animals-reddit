Update for everyone, Operation Bugs Bunny was a success. Ended up catching him/her and turning him/her into the local non-kill shelter.

Edit: He is in Rapid City, South Dakota if anyone is looking for a chill pet!

Edit #2: For everyone asking how I was able to catch him, I was actually able to just get him to come to me with a piece of broccoli. After that I was able to grab the skin on his back and carry him inside. I kept him in a plastic container with the lid open while I called the shelter and grabbed my keys. He actually ended up hopping out while I was away but luckily he isn't the best at hiding. 
Please save this bun! We found ours outside, emaciated and dying. She‚Äôs been with us 7 years now. Be a hero!

Edit: Awesome to hear so many rescue stories. Bunnies are amazingly sweet animals. 
I don't know where you live but that looks like someone's pet
That's a domestic rabbit - he needs help, Can you corral him or grab him and take him inside? I'm a member of the House Rabbit Society-look them up online if you have any questions they have shelters in a lot of states- you can also look up things on Binky Bunny

I had some rabbits outside in a 200 sq ft dog kennel. Wild bunnies would visit. One year, there was one who visited every day. I decided I would give him some fruit too (mine loved bananas), so I carefully approached him with some fruit, still leaving room for him to come to me so he wouldn't run away. He came up to me, sniffed the fruit and then turned around and sprayed me with piss and ran off. Asshole rabbit!
Bunny owner here. It‚Äôs almost impossible to catch bunnies especially when they are scared. If I need to pick mine up and he‚Äôs running around everywhere, the best way is to throw a towel over him- they stop moving and can be picked up. 
That's a domestic pet rabbit. It will die if not caught soon. 
Hi /u/rcarter95,   
As everyone else is saying, this is obviously a domestic rabbit who, for whatever reason, is left outside. Please make every effort to capture the little guy/gal and take it to a rescue. From your photo, it looks extremely malnourished. 
There are a number of rabbit rescues in South Dakota: https://www.google.com/search?q=rabbit+rescue+south+dakota&oq=south+dakota+rabbit+rescu

It won't cost you a dime (just some veggies while you make contact with a rescue) for you to bring it to them. Please, as a bun-parent, save this little guys life. 

**Edit**: If the rescue does require some sort of fee, I will pay it for you. 
This is so sad, this is not a wild rabbit, it's a dumped pet. Poor thing is severely malnourished and honestly if OP did not take him/her in it'll be dead within 5-10 days. Domesticated rabbits aren't as afraid of people as wild rabbits are and currently with the lack of edible vegetation in your area right now, this poor rabbit is searching everywhere possible for some food. Ugh I'm a rabbit owner and this just makes my heart hurt. 

Edit: OP please if you see this if you see him again don't try to chase him, bring him some good again and when he's eating try to toss a towel onto him, he will be stunned for a moment as to what direction to go and you'll be able to fold the towel in and pick him/her up from under the back feet and front of the chest. You can call a local shelter and if they can't do anything try some smaller mom and pop style pet supply stores that also sell pets and offer grooming etc they typically will take rabbits in. Please contact your local spca if you can successfully bring her in.
Thanks for feeding him! Like others have said, he‚Äôs most likely been dumped outside by previous owners. Needs to be fed and taken inside. If you can, please catch him and at least take to an animal rescue. 
Thats someone pet for sure..
Please try to save him
That is a rabbit.

I can tell because I know my animals.
r/BunniesStandingUp
Please save him!
[deleted]
PLEASE OP!!! update us!!!! We all want to know if he's ok !!!
I'm sure this has been said on this sub a million times, but be careful feeding rabbits too many carrots. They're too high in sugar, so too much can be bad for their health. Of course, just one time while meeting this rabbit doesn't mean much, but still, trying to keep the spread of 'Rabbits love carrots!' stereotype down.
That looks like a chocolate tyrannosaurs (real bread feels like velvet for the fur)
I'd have taken it inside and out of the cold, its bound to have escaped from somewhere. Perhaps you might want to door knock on the houses in your street?
South dakotan here...that is a domestic rabbit. Catch it if you can.
That's a weird ass dog...
Good boy AND pretty boy, 13/10
I hope you can give us an update!
This should be cute, but I've seen Watership Down a one too many times. 
I am stressed out now over this hungry abandoned bun.  Please keep updating.  Now that you've fed him, hopefully he'll hang around as you might be his only food source.  Please put a bowl of water outside for him too.
What's this hare doing in my coupe ?
Def not a wild bunny dude- catch him and raise him as your own, he's very pretty
please update us if you see this little guy again :(
Not gonna lie, I‚Äôm super emotionally invested in this rabbit after reading like 3 of the top comments. 

SOMEBUNNY SAVE THIS GUY!!
Hey just a heads up, be careful what you feed rabbits. Their primary food source is grass, which they have to eat a ton of and then re-eat their own poop to adequately digest it and get all the nutrients out of it. Grass is a very low caloric density food, the only sugar is cellulose. Human foods (carrot roots, broccoli, etc) produce gas and the simple rabbit digestive track has no way to pass it. As a result, if they have more gas in their system than can make its way out through the blood stream, they will get really bloated and sick. 

TL;DR feed rabbits grass and high quality pellets only. 
That must be so weird as an animal experiencing being fed by a human.

Imagine if you were alone and came across a polar bear who just starts handing you cheeseburgers and fries

poor buddy. he's way, way too thin. he's probably been struggling to survive out there for a while. domestic rabbits aren't like wild rabbits, they can't do that shit.
I want to take him home but I am in Australia. He probably wouldn't post well.  
  
Please look after little furry bro.
Watch out, these little critters are known to chew on wiring harnesses between the engine and firewall of cars.  Even had one that I witnessed the little bugger run out of a customers car that had been towed in for a no start.
Please update: poor bunny is lost or abandoned. Google bunny rescues. Put food  and water out and maybe a box with straw. 
Please update. 
If you find this guy and are near SEK, reach out to me. I can help you rehome him. This is a domestic rabbit and needs serious attention.
Why were you late to work today?

Found a bunny under my car and spent 20 minutes feeding him veggies.

Oh.. ok. Was he soft?
You‚Äôre a good rabbit person
Hopefully he‚Äôll be sticking around after you fed him so much.

Hope to hear an update!
Picture didn't load at first so i thought he was feeding a person carrots under his car
I see this fella at my place of work almost every day https://imgur.com/mjxQGf5
Hmm. Strange. What kind of cat is that? 
Please do not give him away for free. Too many people are looking to abuse animals.
Feeding him /r/aww vegetables, I see.
Thank you for being such a good person!!
I thought broccoli was bad for rabbits?
If that happened to me I'd have me a new pet. But first seeing if he does belong to someone
it good habit to love the pets
That‚Äôs a weird horse.
Our neighbor‚Äôs pet bunny burrowed out of his cage, under their fence and into our yard.  Twice.  They can be real escape artists.  He definitely looks like an escaped or dumped pet.  I hope you can help little bun bun or find someone else who can. 
Oh bring him to a rescue! Also lettuce is probably the best thing for him. Broccoli causes gas and is good in limited amounts. Carrots kinda okay as well. Just wanted to let you know so you don‚Äôt cause the litter guy to have stomach upset. Looks cute! Emaciated but cute! 
He also looks to be maybe these breeds to me: Rex or Belgian hare. Can‚Äôt tell because he‚Äôs standing so upright and pretty though.

Update us cause I‚Äôd love to hear if you caught him or where he goes!
OP better deliver this rabbit safely to Reddit or bad things are going to happen...
People who dump pets should get a fine. Animal's life is not a play thing and owning a pet is a big responsibility.
Now you have to look under your car every day. Forever. 
Please take him to the vet!! That is not a wild rabbit!! 
That's right OP. Get him nice and fat in time for easter....hmmm
My daughter used to raise show rabbits...this is not a wild rabbit IMHO.  I think it is a breed rabbit or show rabbit that got away from someone's cage...
That's one beautiful horse
Buff it up for roast 
Thank you for taking him to shelter! He already looks happier~! I hope he gets new owner though. 

https://imgur.com/a/22F6T
He‚Äôs beautiful üòç
I'm confused, is it wabbit season or duck season? 
I know this might be silly, but can you tell us what happens? If you see the bunny again and are able to catch him? If not, no worries.

It started a sweet story, then sad really quick. Thanks for being a good human.
this is why I always carry carrots in a little baggie on my person. You just never know when it'll be helpful.
Good friend. Nice human.
[I'll just leave this here](https://youtu.be/cGyQmH9NZcw)
Poor hunger-bun!
You have a new pet now!
Update us if you are able to save it please!
What a cutie.
I always thought carrots were bad for rabbits. ?
Cute little bunny. Wonder if it's wild.
It‚Äôs fiver!
that thing looks hungry. like it hasnt eaten in weeks.
Plz update thread when u save this bunny. My whole day is riding on this bunny‚Äôs survival OP. Dont let me down.
‚ÄúCarter! Why were you late for work!?‚Äù
*shows picture*
‚ÄúGod dammit that‚Äôs cute. Alright you‚Äôre forgiven.‚Äù
Please catch him and take care of him or find a foster rabbit place close by! 
Hence fourth he shall be called Ted.
Please save the bunny-if I lived there I would do it myself. That angel baby needs a home & please update. God bless you.
Not too many carrots please, they aren't that healthy for bunnies in excess
Oh please find him and save him. If you can‚Äôt keep him there should be a rescue that will take him. Or her. 
Awe poor pet rabbit, I hope you can find him again.

I see rabbits under my car all the time... but they run the second they hear me üòê
Ok I appreciate the Baby Got Back references, but seriously, did they find the bun and rescue him?!
My neighbor, down the hill around the corner (i can see his yard from mine in fall/winter),  has a bunch of domestic rabbits roam around free. Sometimes they are in my yard. I throw food for them. But they are skittish, they run from me. 

I might do this one day too. I feel like it's irresponsible, but I'll get the females fixed if it gets out of hand. 

I've heard of other stories of local people doing it as well, with domestic rabbits, kinda like backyard chickens lol, apparently it's a thing in Michigan
I hope you can take him in or find him a good home. The winter has probably been too brutal for the little guy and he‚Äôs in desperate need of food and shelter. 

Oh, and focus on feeding him lettuces and other leafy green veggies. Kinda want to avoid too much carrots... If you‚Äôre not going to keep him or find him a home, can you please, buy some rabbit food pellets and sprinkle it around where you see the rabbit(s) so the poor things don‚Äôt starve? 

P.S. His head is more elongated and defined features and his ears are kinda big and longer than a normal rabbit. He may be a ‚Äúhare‚Äù. I can‚Äôt tell too much from the photo for a definitive ID though.
[deleted]
The fact that you had 10 minutes to spare in the morning is already impressive. You're pretty cool OP.
Thats really sweet that you're feeding him because he looks a bit on the skinny side 
That's someone's pet! Pleeeaasse try to bring him home or get him to a rescue. Domesticated bunnies will not survive in the wild.
Rabbit looks malnourished:( i hope youre able to catch him and take it to a doctor.
OMG my little Thumper - thank you for feeding him and not eating him. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Poor baby!! Please save him OP I‚Äôm counting on you!!!! *hugs* to you and the bunny
Please OP. Save this bunbun. 
Goddammnit, now I'm worrying about that starving abandoned rabbit freezing his cottontail off in Bumblefuck, South Idaminnewyomibraska or wherever. I need closure!
Piggybacking here, I just heard on the radio this morning that, after dogs and cats, rabbits are the most commonly abandoned pets in the states.
I don't know if this always works but as a kid I'll never forget watching my neighbor catch a stray rabbit in our yard by shining a bright light on it or in its' eyes. Craziest thing... He shined the light and the rabbit froze. He just walked up to it with the light on it the whole time. Just reached down and picked it up. It was really quite amazing. 
so cute!
Please update us if you catch him!!
He doesn't care-its broccoli
That‚Äôs awesome. Good work OP! 
YAY! You‚Äôre awesome op
Bunny.
That is a handsome bun.
I hope you kept it. This is how animal buddy movies start
Give him a home :(
Why do anthropologists make hunting and gathering sound so difficult?
/u/weesiwiggles

Please save lil feller
I MUST KNOW 
Yeah fatten it up, good eats.
Ayy that's awesome 
I want to know how you were getting in your car with at least 10 minutes to spare. Impressive!
You leave for work with more than 10 minutes to spare? You are the most organized person I've ever heard of.
I know it's late, but thank you for saving it. I have a couple of hippity-hoppers myself and they are wonderful little guys.

I hope you have a great night. :)
That is almost certainly an escaped indoor pet. The fur color is not matching the season.
interestingly, this rabbit has had a very long life

you can tell by the fur. what a cutie

wish i had rabbits near my house. all i have are neighborhood cats, pigeons, blue jays, squirrels, and voles. my life would be nearly complete if i could feed some wild rabbits

cheers ‚ù§Ô∏è
So cute ‚ô°
Yes!! Humanity to rabbit exists!!
Boss: Why were you late for work?
OP: *Shows the Reddit post*
Boss: Carry on.
We have a neighborhood rabbit that everyone feeds and it's huge. It's some what friendly too so we think it was someones pet that got out. He's doing real good for himself by his size!
I remember I found a white rabbit outside. With red eyes and a big tumor on his nose. He sneezed constantly. I got him medicine and fed him daily and his tumor went away. He grew as big as a house. I named him Pete. He pissed on EVERYTHING but he loved to sit on the couch and watch TV with us. He was my sweet rabbit friend for a time. I rehomed him to my 8 year old cousin after about two years so he could get more love and attention. He lived a good life. Found out later he was probably one of those Fair "win a bunny or chick" prizes that someone dumped. I hate those things now. 
Please take it to a vet, that isn't a wild rabbit and it's starving. It's probably an escaped show rabbit.
You did right thing.

Look at this poor guy, he's all bones.

Maybe leave him couple of veggies every day so he can come back...
Don‚Äôt want none unless you got buns hun. 
We just adopted a rabbit who was found outside in the winter. He is honestly one of the best pets I've ever had. Sad to see this one in such rough shape. 
THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA HAS BEEN COMPROMISED!!!
That is one weird looking cat. 
He's so big. What does a wild bunny eat to make it that large?
Your broccoli looks very green and fresh
10 minutes of eating broccoli?

Rabbit farts anyone?

Poor little guy, thank you for saving him!
When I was in elementary school one day on my way to school I saw a little kitten with no collar. Took him/her with me to school and hid on the play ground with it. I skipped all day to feed it from my lunch box and play with it. Fed it those little frozen baby carrots but I had to break it up to make it small enough to eat. Rubbed my hands raw and was picking carrot bits out of my nails for a week afterwards but it was totally worth it.
That's a Fiver if I ever saw one.
Extremly cute‚ù§Ô∏è And nice of you to feed him! I hope everything works out for the best for him!
Just as a side note, carrots and other veggies and fruits aren't healthy for a rabbit to eat as their main source of nutrition. 
This is a true story. When I was young my dad found a rabbit just like that under his car. It had a number tattooed in its ear and must of escaped a local farm. We kept it and it was the chilliest, coolest pet. We even could let it out in the back yard with no fence and it would never go far and come back when we called it. We named it Rosie.  Someone grab this rabbit. I bet it‚Äôs amazing. 
Oooh! Beautiful bunny,  definitely not wild,  maybe a Flemish giant? Obviously someone couldn't take care of him anymore so they set him free,  generally not a great move with a domesticated rabbit,  as they don't always know what to eat,  hmm. Course he could've escaped too. So pretty, and they're SO soft!
from what i have heard, carrots are high in sugar and not good for bunnies.
That actually pisses me the hell off. I had a rabbit for a while, and I absolutely loved that girl, she was such a good bun. I want to get two and bond them. Whoever dumped this rabbit deserves to be shot 
You‚Äôre a real Disney princess now!
I don't have so much luck, they run away when they see me
Man I wish I were some place where there was snow on the ground instead of sweating my ass off over here in the southeast US...IN FEBRUARY! (Glad you saved the little guy, OP!)
What mind of dog is that?
Thanks OP, you rock! You're my hero for the day
Nice Honda üëåüèª
I've owned rabbits and let me tell you, there is no way that's a free roaming bunny.  Rabbits instinctively do not just chill out and let you pick them up.  They have a horrifying scream when they are scared.  My pets would scream when they encountered our dog.  As a wild rabbit, jackrabbit, bush bunny, etc, they don't just chill, and they almost never have coats like that.  Now I fully believe you encountered this at ease rabbit, I once had a stray cat come into the country side and it was so chill once It trusted me that it enjoyed a tummy rub.  When the hell does cats ever enjoy that mind you a stray that walks up.  Point is, this thing for sure was a pet.

This is the only type of rabbit you are going to see besides and all white monsterous jack rabbit in south dakota, I'm from North Dakota so I'm pretty fluent in the wild life up here.  https://naturalunseenhazards.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/800px-nuttalls_cottontail_sylvilagus_nuttalliipd_usdofenergy1.jpg
Help! I can‚Äôt find the wormhole!
How can I have someone hold my [blank] and go in now?
you take that rabbit inside and love him >:(
This rabbit is definitely domestic!! OP please please try to catch it, you can set up a little box with food and water inside. My last pet rabbit was abandoned by her previous owner ‚Äî it‚Äôs terrible but people do it often.
Don't feed broccoli! Rabbits can't fart - they get bloated and then have gut issues.

But that's one friendly bun! 
Is broccoli a good idea? I have no idea if it's good for a wabbit...I just worry about wabbit phrts
Please update us! üôèüèº
Pack that bunny up and bring it to me in Colorado. I will raise it to be my own. 
That is definitely a domesticated rabbit. Looks like it could be a mini rex.
After looking at all these comments, now knowing that a pet rabbit was abandoned and now is starving and cold, makes me sad:( I hope you went back out there and found him. 
OP please update when you can. He‚Äôs definitely a pet rabbit, tort colored mini Rex or Rex mix. I‚Äôm quite worried about this poor baby, I hope there is a happy ending here.
OP THIS IS NOT A WILD RABBIT (I'm 98% sure)!!! Please try to lure it close again and then throw a towel over it and bring it to a vet or ASPCA. Maybe someone is missing their pet!! 
He was picky about the food because there was a hair in it üòÄ
I m brown bun.

FYI, carrots are bad for rabbits. They do not eat root vegetables in the wild.

www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/pets-health/9353529/Carrots-are-bad-for-rabbits-RSPCA-says.html
[removed]
I'm no expert, but I believe carrots are actually rather unhealthy for a rabbit, in normal circumstances. I've seen it compared to giving them canfy bars instead of a meal. Although, if that would fatten the poor thing up a little, maybe it wouldn't actually hurt, in this case.
[removed]
Tbh this rabbit looks in pretty bad shape so it probably shouldn‚Äôt be returned to the owner because it‚Äôs possible they will mistreat him.
Looks a bit like a Rex rabbit. They have extra nice coats. 
Weird ‚Ä¶ they're usually afraid of hrududus.
Adopt that little rabbit if said rabbit has no home.
Carrots are actually bad for rabbits. The idea that they like them only came from bugs bunny. 

Adorable little fucker though. 
Please find this little guy. And please update us. He clearly needs some loving!
90% sure carrots are bad for rabbits. Could be wrong
Did he eat it *rabbitly* ?
Check with some animal rescue groups in your area to see if any will loan you a humane trap. That sweet baby needs rescued ASAP!  
Do you look under you look under your car every morning? Or did he just get lucky?
He's too skinny. If you see him again, capture him and take him to someone who can help him, or buy some rabbit chow to feed and provide actual nutrition. That's not a wild rabbit.
OP please
That's a Japanese Harlequin rabbit! Might have been for breeding and showing, or just a pet. You should take him in and try and find his family. Be careful though because they are really smart for a rabbit, so he probably busted out of his cage!
Why do we care about rabbits but we eat like every other animal 
That's 100% a pet rabbit. No winter fur. 
Please try to find him again, he needs help! He looks like he's been fighting to survive and I can't bear to even look at his little strained eyes... ;( he probably didn't go far since you've fed him and will likely still be close by waiting for you to do so again. Save the rabbit.. for the rabbit.. and for all of us! 
just adopt him my man
PLEASE save this bunny!!! The fact that he let you that close shows he‚Äôs 100% domesticated. Plz plz plz x
/u/whissk
I wish I were content with just broccoli and carrots.  
dou you save carrots and brocoli in ur car just in case?
Did that hare lose his spectacles? 
So what did you eat for lunch? Hummus with a spoon? 
Does he look too skinny or is it just the perspective?
u/opfeels u/pandainvasion2k17
For sure someone pet that was probably doing fairly well when the weather was great so it stayed away from humans. But now the weather sucks so it is going to know where it gets good
Too much broccoli is bad for rabbits because its gassy, as well as too many carrots(because sugar) . 
What did you eat for lunch?
That's a small wallaby
You‚Äôre living my dreams
Just FYI you should only feed carrots to bunnies in small amounts they're not very good for them. 
Looks like Fiver.
bun
Holy crap, I know of someone that owns the exact breed of rabbit. It is most definitely a pet that has been dumped/lost. One question bugs me (har har), what kind of breed is this rabbit?
What if he had ebola?
Nice
Bunny: heh, this guy's soft
It's as they said he looks really skinny
RUNNY BABBIT
awww. I love rabbits.. where i live theres a lot of wild ones or whatever you call them running all around.. some of them are freaking HUGE.. like freakishly big lol
This is the start of a future Disney movie. 
Save him OP
I would have done the same thing. If you can't catch him just feed him regularly. I've known a few hillbillies in Michigan have "wild" pet rabbits roam free on their property. The neighbours where I live now have the same shit going on right now, they come in my yard. I think they are adorable.  I dunno what breed, I imagine not all could survive these winters,  but this one appears to be handling the cold just fine. 
I signed in  just to upvote this 
So cuty you are both luky
Congratulations, you are now a moderator at /r/disneyprincesses/
Friendly, doesn't look like a wild rabbit, gonna guess some kid is missing their pet rabbit.
If I am under your mat, do I get food too?
Aaaaand he'll be back. 
Please save him :(
Don't give him broccoli (digestive problems), use spinach instead.
You found Dobby...
Please try to take him in. I had the same situation a few years ago with two rabbits. We were hand feeding them, one disappeared within a few days and we found the other one shivering in the street . Got him to a vet and he was to sick to be saved .  
That's awesome - way to help this bunny :)
Save da bun bun
Dont feed carrots to rabbits.
Ark
Thanks OP now I know how to trap animals. Dont tell me this wasnt planned out.
Something something dont feed carrots to rabbits.
Aw so cute! Is this a rabbit or a hare? 
Thats a weird looking dog
TIL that rabbits can stand on two feet.
And I bet you had a great day after that.....
If you are near Portland Oregon I will pick it up just message me where you are 
I saw a small snake yesterday on my back porch and went to feed him a cricket and he bit my finger instead. Next time I'll feed a bunny. 
Wow, why is it so tame???
But where did you get the carrots? ü§îü§îü§î
Please please please catch him/her! That is definitely a pet and will die if not caught!

I have a bunny and they are a such great pets but if you don't want him please take it to a shelter!
Yes 
If I spent that long feeding him I would be like 20 minutes late for work. 
Awwww! You should keep it if it comes back. 
This looks like a hare, not a rabbit?
awwwwwwe
It's Brown already? Here in Edmonton they are still white. So many of them.
Broccoli yes, carrots no. A lie perpetuated by Warner Bros.'s flagship Rabbit character who is a play on Groucho Marx holding a cigar is that rabbits should eat carrots. it actually has too much sugar and carrotine for them.
It's good luck!  Keep it!
The true American dream.
Youre allowed to drop the food
What kind of dog is that?
D.R.A.M?
You don‚Äôt want to feed gaseous foods to rabbits. Carrots good. Broccoli bad. 
Was tempering with your brake line
all i find under my car is rats and the occasional pedestrian
Well done sir
Bunnies don't eat carrots.
What a cute doggo!
Thats a 99 - 00 Honda Civic EX?
That is not a wild rabbit, please catch him.
Aww!üòÄ
Love the feeding advice! It is like having a starving toddler coming up to you and telling him that all you have are Oreos so he is out of luck.

Just feed him whatever non-Funyun food you have on hand in order to catch him. If you are going to hang onto him for more than a couple days, get some hay and do some further research. Good Luck!
That‚Äôs a lot of hare
Miniature greyhound?

10/10 great hooman.
He car jacked ya.
Hello reddit. It is I, cognitive dissonance. What a cute animal. 
Nice try Peter Cottontail publicity firm. 
Please save the little guy and update!
looks like hes been eating well.  thing is huge!

Were you able to catch him?
Are you Snow White? 
Wait wouldn't he leave if you found him/her and left to get vegetables? Or did he stay under ur car and lure him/her out with vegetables when you already had them/after you went to get them?
Idk if anyone posted about this yet, but be very careful with the amount of food /veggies you give them. Their tiny tummies and only take so much.. Source: my sister killed her son's rabbit on accident by feeding him too much broccoli at once.
Just so you know that's against Florida law..........
SO CUTE!
Take it home and love it!
Amazing Lil guy. Looks like like he jumped out of Alice in Wonderland. Such expressive eyes. He's saying I'm late! I'm late! For a very important date! No time to say "Hello", goodbye! I'm late! I'm late!¬†
And this, kids, is why you should never eat your vegetables. That way you always have some on hand for friendly rabbits. 
Yeah it looks cool until you realize he's a paid actor doing a publicity stunt. This is obviously peter rabbit.
Is this a pet? What is it?
If you can‚Äôt keep him, take him to a rabbit rescue - google one for your area. Not the shelter.
I am too anxiously waiting for an update. He's such a well behaved cute guy. I hope he will be found and rescued. 
RemindMe! 1 week "Did the rabbit make it? I hope so!"
What a cute Rabbit =o
That‚Äôs a someone‚Äôs pet
I had a white bunny named Kitty when young. Unfortunately they are social animals that like companionship so she starved herself. It was very upsetting I didn't know to get two of them. 
You are its mom now. 
don't carrots kill rabbits if they eat even a little too much?

Rabbits don't naturally eat root vegetables/fruit. Carrots/fruit are high in sugar and should only be fed in small amounts as occasional treats. Rabbits need mainly hay and/or grass, some leafy greens and a small, measured amount of pellets
Only ten minutes? I would have called in to work and emptied my fridge of all the veggies for the little guy. 
Yay for rabbits. And yay for you leaving at least ten minutes early for something
Rabbit season isn't over yet
Please atleast check your car and make sure he's not under there again before pulling out of the driveway!
be cautious feeding carrots to rabbits because they are high in vitamin c which can be toxic to their bodies.
I thought carrots were bad for rabbits
Feed less carrots.
Looks like a nug
That's a funny looking cat

That critical moment when you (calmly) race inside to grab some food, hoping he doesn‚Äôt ran off by the time you get back. 
Surprised he was so friendly.
Oh he's some handsome! 
Cute one
You spent 10 minutes hand feeding a rabbit carrots and broccoli?

Did you get his autograph?

Was his name BUGS?üòà


this is why you bring carrots and broccoli for lunch
Fiver.
Ohmagawsh so cute!
Killing him softly and slowly with broccoli
Beautiful‚òÜ
I thought it was a hare...
It's Fifer! 

Lord Frith
I'm sure this thread will have a sensible and calm discussion./s
r/Rabbits would like this. Looks exactly like my bun, so I'd agree that the little fella is someone's ex-pet.
Thank you for saving him from the cold. üò≠ Good nice longear doggie. 
üòÇ
Hi Deb.
Thanks for sharing the update! You‚Äôre awesome. 
Awwwwwww Poor Guy 
Peter Rabbit ads are immersive AF
How talk is the bunny? Looks big :o
When you check Reddit all day just to check in on a handsome bunny....
Kangarabbit?
He looks JUST like my bunny Rudy!! 
Don't give rabbits carrots. To much sugar, they get sick.
I'm glad you rescued him, about a year ago my parents, my sister, myself and about half a dozen neighbourhood kids helped to rescue an escape rabbit. Somehow, it survived massive amounts of rain, cold weather, cats, dogs, who knows how many foxes and how many roads it had crossed and guy fawkes night.
 Did you give it the orange part of the carrot?Because I have pet bunnies and the people at the shop said only the green
If that happened to me I'd have me a new pet. But first seeing if he does belong to someone

It's a duck.
Good on ya bro
I found a bunny today too! 
This is why I love reddit. I came here for a pic of someone hand feeding a rabbit (and also to see if people freaked out on OP for feeding a wild animal or because broccoli is poison to rabbits or something.)  Then it turned into a heart warming rescue story
All the rabbits that live near me always run away whenever I get close. :(
Bananas.

I don't know why.  But bananas are what our little bunny friends love most.
yay<3
I looked at it and said to myself "aww kitty" even though that is clearly not a cat hahaha
Great now he's gonna be coming back for the next 2 years like that manatee.
What you need is a few good 'taters...
I thought rabbits shouldn't eat carrots.
How to get rabies 101
What a great use of broccoli!

(Thanks for helping out the bunny)
 and he goes back to the den and tells them about how he met God,  or, at least,  an angel!!
He better have went to work with you.
good job man
Only ten minutes? Are you some kind of rabbit hater?^/s
What? That's cute as hell. I'm jealous man.
Local man contributes to senseless rabbit obesity epidemic. Motives unclear.
So fkn tired of people thinking we have to treat everything as a pest or a burden, thank you for being a great human. Looks fantastic because of the joy in its eyes.
Its almost wabbit season... 
What's Up, OP? *LOONEY TOONES INTENSIFIES*
I want to snuffle him so bad
Did you follow the little guy home and feed the whole family? 
That is such a beautiful animal.
Hey, OP, I think you're missing a few trim pieces off your Civic. 
/u/nzhoward
Looks really skinny u sure he wasn't dumped off?
Don‚Äôt feed them carrots! 

Good dog
If everyone treated the people the meet like this
‚ÄúGood thing I had this broccoli in my pocket...‚Äù
you must have tons of self control. i would have been there for hours
Aww so adorbs üò≠
So cute !
You just got hustled  ü§£
That's one fucking weird looking dog.
I wonder what it's up to right now ‚ù§Ô∏è
Who‚Äôs gonna tend the rabbits?
Its not what you think it is 
Its a baby rabbit 
It looks skinny, probably been out in awhile 
Lady‚Äôs man I see
Kangaroos man....
Coolest looking rabbit ever!
and now youre acat ower
isnt that the cutest thing on earth or what? ü§ó
Thank you for taking the time to feed and save this bunny babe! 
As someone looking for a bun bun. What kind if rabbit is this. It doesn't look like a traditional rabbit.
Aww what a beauty, glad you caught him so he can find a good home because that is definitely NOT a wild bun!
Wow what a cool looking rabbit. I'd like to do this someday.
I wonder who was trying to send you a message...
arnt carrots actually bad for buns?
That‚Äôs a weird looking cat.
The thumbnail looks like a thick chick taking a selfie at the bottom of a water slide. 
Peter Rabbit at it again 
aawww what a lovely pic! The world needs more people with empathy! Last week I found a baby cat also under my car , and now he's the newest member of my family :)
I‚Äôve seen plenty of bunny rabbits on the Internet but this is the first one that made me immediately think of the Watership Down cartoon for some reason.
I too was reminded of an Australian add that mentions rabbits ‚ÄúDad. Why did they build the Great Wall of China?‚Äù 
‚ÄúThat, that was, during the time of the Emperor Nasi Goreng. And, ah, it was to keep the rabbits out. Too many rabbits, in China.‚Äù :) 
I read the title and I thought you were referring to a human man
Oh EM gee 
Did you see a scrotum?  Penis?
Stop feeding them carrots, they're not the best for them 
That's definitely someone's pet
Carrot's are basically the same as chocolate to bunnies so dont give him too much.
I‚Äôm not completely sober and definitely thought this was a baby kangaroo at first. Admittedly, I don‚Äôt really know what a baby kangaroo looks like. 
how did you notice him without first driving off?
I keep thinking this thumbnail is a sexy chick in a hot tub. 
I also find creative ways to get rid of my carrots and broccoli.

Sorry I know nothing about rabbits, is this not a wild one?
How does one just have 10 mins worth of carrots and broccoli on them to feed a bunny?
cat with long ears?

So adorable 
The sequel to Peter Rabbit looks good! 
what the fuck is that a capIbarra?
Did OP catch him??
Wascally Wabbit
Where did you find a brown rabbit during the winter? 
That's a funny looking dog
I never do this because i guy that moved near me as a kid killed all the friendly squirrles

What is it??
Good on you for treating the rabbit that way, I'm surprised he was still hungry after filling up on the car's wiring.
Cool bun bro. 
I think he‚Äôs supposed to give you a green star now. 
yea, I have that rabbits cousin    in my garden, under my home and often dead on the street. Why people give these pest to there children for easter then send them in the way to my garden is anyones guess. 
That‚Äôs some fresh ass looking broccoli. 
What a beautiful bunny, I hope they find their mom/dad
Ended up being late to work lol
There is a band of rabits that populate the grounds of a local McDonalds. Literally every time I go there I see them hopping around burrowing in the grass. They're definitely not wild, because they are all kinds of different colors, they look like escaped pets or something. I've often thought of feeding them or maybe trying to keep one, but is that a bad idea?
I had rabbit fever once. Literally.
Rabbits make great pets. 
that is one handsome bun!

Carrots arent good for rabbits. Carrots are a dessert. Broccoli is good, most green veggies are good. Cute though!!
*IT'S A BUN!!!*
Well done op
Did you [notify everyone](https://m.xkcd.com/1871/)?
 Part rabbit part reindeer
OP may have started something.  It'll be waiting there tomorrow too, then next week it'll bring a friend.  This carries on until you have to employ other people to feed all the rabbits.
Looks like a real Snuggle Bunny

So cuteüòçüòç
Actualy you shouldn't feed him carrots
You shouldn't feed them carrots, not good for the little guys
This thread needs another 700 comments telling OP what he already knows!
It's a duck.
My neighbors daughter used to raise rabbits for 4H.  When she went away to college her rabbit collection 'escaped'.  I think her parents set them loose.  The neighborhood has a lot of rabbits running around that look like Easter bunnies, but their 100th generation wild, descended from show rabbits.  That's what this guy looks like.
So at what point did you punt it
Poor baby! He's definitely not a wild rabbit. Thank you for rescuing him!
Not sure if it's been mentioned, but cross post this to r/rabbits, maybe some one local is looking for a friend. If I was local I'd grab this bun!!
Am Australian. I only find snakes under my car
Carrots can kill it
That rabbit is ripped.
Way to stave off starvation for a couple of days. 
One of my good friends loves bunnies so she would most likely die of joy if she saw this. 
Anyone know what kind of breed this is? I love this colouring and have never seen it on a rabbit before.
Must've been someone's pet?
RemindMe! 1 week
So cute
Carrots are like candy for rabbits. Careful with that. 
Carrots are actually toxic for bunnies. I hope you didnt feed him a huge amount (a little is perfectly fine) :)

Source: Own 5 bunnies
I know most people here won't say this but... they taste good.
I don't know, you may never get rid of him now. But I know the rabbit was happy
Now you've done it. You've associated humans with food for him, now he'll be a danger to everyone who is unlucky enough to encounter him.

Edit: Judging from the downvotes, I guess you guys couldn't hear the sarcastic tone I used while typing this.
Don't feed wildlife and animals you are not familiar with.
I know you had good intentions when you decided to feed this rabbit but it's really an awful idea that will have a long lasting negative impact on the poor animal.  Rabbits are herbivores yes, but giving a wild animal food which is not native to their habitat is worst than letting them go hungry.  A rabbit's digestive system is very fragile and giving them something outside of their regular diet can make their entire system go into shock.  It's the same shock felt when in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer‚Äôs table.
Carrots are bad for rabbits
Maybe don't encourage the rabbit to rest under cars? 

Sheltering animals can die when the unsuspecting human restarts the car and an animal is under or inside the car. I have seen this happen.

Animals will return to places associated with food.
Rabbits aren't designed to eat carrots and other super carby veg. You probably made it sick.
Don't feed it carrots they actually aren't good for rabbits. Feed it the carrot greens, spinach, lettuce, dunno if broccoli is good for them or not however.
This isn't "awww".  That's a likely dead rabbit by now if OP didn't save it.
expected: Was 10 minutes late for work. Got fired. Out of money. Cooked rabbit.
There's this guy on my college campus that sets up a little station where you can hold his rabbits during finals to relieve stress. 

I asked him why he always has like eight rabbits. He said he was a biology student and rabbits are a great sustainable source of lean protein and he was trying to breed the perfect bunny with large haunches for eating. 

I said he should maybe not mention that to anyone else.
Here your are finding a live rabbit, and all I found today was a severed rabbit head behind my apartment.
[removed]
fattening bunny for the pot?
Yeah and he wouldn't have spent half that amount of time feeding the homeless
It was probably not a good idea feeding carrots and broccoli to a rabbit as they predominantly eat grass, hay and other similar plants. You should also take this rabbit to a animal shelter as it's quite likely someone's lost pet. 
CARROTS ARE BAD FOR RABBITS
Why can‚Äôt stuff like this ever happen to me? I want to hand feed a wild bunny something!
Wait aren‚Äôt carrots bad for buns
You have 10 minutes to spare on a Wednesday morning? I'm impressed, I would have still been sleeping.
Rabbit.
we kin haz it now

~dogz
I appreciate OP trying to do the right thing here but neither of those veggies are actually good for a rabbit. Carrots have too much sugar in them and dark greens such as broccoli produce gas which rabbits have trouble working through their system. If you don‚Äôt own rabbits you probably don‚Äôt have hay on hand but try to stick to light greens such as Romaine. Neither of the foods are likely to kill him but really should be avoided or at least very limited in their diets.
OP is currently sleeping with a full belly of stew. 

Will reply on rabbit's health tomorrow.
Clearly your not Italian or it‚Äôd be what‚Äôs for dinner tonight
Broccoli is not good for rabbits
 He looks beautiful.  I always wonder what they're thinking.  In a Watership Down kind of way. 
Wait why did OP bring it to a shelter when thats a wild animal..
[deleted]
It's actually illegal to feed wild rabbits. They will become dependant on the broccoli and lose all fear of cars thus making them more likely to get ran over. 
Stop feeding it carrots. Rabbits suck at digesting root veggies. 
No more carrots pls. Super sugary. Bad for waskawy wabbits!
Yay. Maybe he‚Äôll starve next winter when no one is as thoughtless as you were today. 
So no one is going to point out carrots are awful for rabbit health?
Dinner came to you!
