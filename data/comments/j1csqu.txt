It's official. We have now seen it all. Everything. Even the kitten sink.
‚ÄúIf I fits I si....oh myyyy‚Äù
His ears are saying, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what the hell is happening but... ooh I think I like it.‚Äù
How has no one pointed out that its just one of those U pillows people bring on airplanes. It has a big hole in the middle.
Quicksand
Cozy!!!
I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs heavy enough to sink at all
This is the first post that's ever made me laugh before I even watched
Sowf
Does anyone else want to push her little booty down in farther so she‚Äôs evenly smooched?
So cuteüò©ü•∫, now I'm missing my cat
Ready for take off with those airplane ears!
A kitten would never sink into memory foam like that.  It's gotta be a pillow with a hole in the middle.
camoflawwwww
The kitty is loafing around ‚ú®üçû
I could watch this all day!
So it is true....cats can change their density.
\*pillow will remember this\*
Extreme loafing!

u/Squishydafishy
My first reaction was to yell "DON'T GIVE IN TO THE SADNESS, ARTAX!"
Artax!!!!
Finally! A go to demonstration of what equal parts terror and absolute comfort look like!
Awww he's/shes got the baby duck fuzz still!! Love that!!
Those ears tell you all about his conflicting feelings about the pillow. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Such an aww moment~
I need more videos like this- animals reacting to memory foam. I‚Äôm gonna go google it now.
God I wish that were me -_-
Found Footage
Legends say he continues to explore the depth of that cushion.
Wait, is this QUICK SAND? Oh, no, I like dis.
Looks 100% like my cat.
I want this pillow, where can I get it?
10/10 delivers on what was promised.
This is fine
What are you sinking about?
Oh no Hooman save me from this quicksand
If i fits i sits
Fuckin luv dis üíã
That pillow is now the cat's.
Comfort follows concern.

‚ÄúHmm, what‚Äôs going OH SHIT oh nevermind it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù
That sweet baby doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening to it!
my heart just exploded ouch ouch ouch
Oh how I wish I was made out of memory foam so a kitten could shrink into meü•∫
This reminds me of the kid that is lowered into the snacks and does the wiggly manoeuvre for maximum snack lift
and the band played on
OMG :3
He became the potato
Only half sunk because their engines are in the front.
Preparing for take-off.
Awwww his r/airplaneears when he realize he is in trouble
If I... uhh, fits.. then I.. wait, ok this is good... sits
The foam remembers the kitten!
I see a kind of calm and relaxation in its manner that resonates with the safety and warmness of the pillow
So cute!
"If I fits I... uh... if I stinks I sinks."
Kitten's reaction: "Oh. Oh! Oooooooh!!!!"
Comfy kitty
Umm... I want to be that kitten
I bet the foam will never forget that experience.
The kitten:Time to sleep ahhh.(calm)
Me:awww
Kitten:what the why am I sinking (fear)
Kitten again : Good bye (ok)
What happened
memory quick sand pillow
The booty is buoyant
Thats one heavy kitten.

FUCKING AWWW
Btw, memory foam mattresses are a god send.
Hes like "oh... Alright. imma fw it"
oh to be a kitten sinking into memory foam ü•∫
You know the content is good when it's got multiple reddit awards you've never seen before.
I can only hope to one day achieve this level of comfort.
concern, CONCERN,..CONCERN!!!..comfort?!
How much does that spud weigh?
That is pure cosiness visualised
The cats like 

As I lay here

Going deep

I feel a great comfort on my feet

I feel so comfy I'm going to sleep

So of could be so kind as turn off the light

That would be a delight
Awww! My heart is melting just like the kitten into the pillow.
Why is his front heavier than his rear?
Cuuute!
I can watch this all day long
Me saying "just five more minutes "as I sink back into sleep
And there he goes
OH! Ooohhh....
OMG ! my wife said she thought the pillow was sand.
Best memory this pillow will ever have!
Submarine go brrr
skill is required by all.
It's like "aw, yeah, I like dis."
Me the first time I got my memory foam pillow
Ahhhhhhhhhh can‚Äôt handle!
Memory foam... all alone in the moonlight...

Looks like my cat
Gfycat... Check.
this is so adorable I can‚Äôt even deal awwwwww üòçüòçüòç
Nah that kitten isn‚Äôt nearly heavy enough to cause a depression that deep.

Look at its body language: eyes wide, ears back, body low, hind legs planted firmly. This kitten is practicing their ‚Äúpounce‚Äù pose. Owner is likely waving a toy off camera.

Got a memory foam pillow just after I adopted the cat I have now.  She's slept there on the top of my head every night since.

Kitty looks comfy
I've played to much d&d, my first thought was either a slime or mimic was eating that cat.
It remembers me!
Soo cute

That's a lot of floof.
And now children, observe what happens when water meets oil.
This... Does put a smile to my face

Normally the cat changes to fit the container, but this time the container changed to fit the cat.

Who wouldn‚Äôt sink into a memory foam bed
Last time this was posted it was pointed out that this is just a pillow with a hole in the middle as you can see the divot before the kitty starts to lower itself in.
She is precious!

this is so adorable :3
And its journey to the cat dimension begins.
Purrfect.
Aww the kitten is so cute‚ù§Ô∏è
u/wrenco
I wonder if he remembers
that's a pillow with a hole in the middle covered with a blanket, not memory foam. memory foam doesn't even sink that much under a human's weight, never mind the negligible weight of a kitten.

Am I stopping yet?....üò≥
This pillow will have a good memory after this!)
Omg lol
Tom, where do you get all of the pictures that you post?
This be mah sinky spot!
Only on reddit do I believe people don't put covers on their pillows, or sheets on their mattresses
That's just wholesome.
I can practically hear the AAAHHHH coming outta the cat lol
He's like...what is this?  Oh, I'm becoming more stealthy by the second! Ears back!   Legs taught!
r/airplaneears
So that's where my kitten Bob keeps disappearing to.

(Seriously, we apparently have clones, granted, there's a lot of orange cats out there.)
Reminds me of my friend's 3 year old who will lie down anywhere soft and proclaim "I AM DONE!" and just sink in lol.

you know that reaction in your brain when something is so cute you want to pinch it? Yeah, that...
The ears do the "I know there is something wrong, but I don't know what, so I'm just gonna pretend everything is right."
Awwwww
He/she isn't sinking, they're docking in the same way R2 docks in an X wing
He is unsure, but then likes.
Was scrolling past and 100% thought you said Meowmory foam
So satisfying to watch üòÇ

Oh God, this is heaven.......

It's too cute, lol.
This is a good camouflage for the fearsome one

I don't know if I'm tired or pissed off . Let's try tired first and see .
Memory. All alone in the moonlight.

At least the kitty will not be bothered by all the body heat that stuff retains.
