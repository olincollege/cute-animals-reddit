You can see the panic on his face for a second lmao

It's official. We have now seen it all. Everything. Even the kitten sink.
“If I fits I si....oh myyyy”
His ears are saying, “I don’t know what the hell is happening but... ooh I think I like it.”
How has no one pointed out that its just one of those U pillows people bring on airplanes. It has a big hole in the middle.
Quicksand
Cozy!!!
I’m surprised it’s heavy enough to sink at all
This is the first post that's ever made me laugh before I even watched
Sowf
Does anyone else want to push her little booty down in farther so she’s evenly smooched?
So cute😩🥺, now I'm missing my cat
Ready for take off with those airplane ears!
A kitten would never sink into memory foam like that.  It's gotta be a pillow with a hole in the middle.
camoflawwwww
The kitty is loafing around ✨🍞
I could watch this all day!
So it is true....cats can change their density.
\*pillow will remember this\*
Extreme loafing!

Hooman, I is sinking in pillow. Help

u/Squishydafishy
My first reaction was to yell "DON'T GIVE IN TO THE SADNESS, ARTAX!"
Artax!!!!
Finally! A go to demonstration of what equal parts terror and absolute comfort look like!
Awww he's/shes got the baby duck fuzz still!! Love that!!
Those ears tell you all about his conflicting feelings about the pillow. 😂😂😂
Such an aww moment~
I need more videos like this- animals reacting to memory foam. I’m gonna go google it now.
God I wish that were me -_-
Found Footage
Legends say he continues to explore the depth of that cushion.
Wait, is this QUICK SAND? Oh, no, I like dis.
Looks 100% like my cat.
I want this pillow, where can I get it?
10/10 delivers on what was promised.
This is fine
What are you sinking about?
Oh no Hooman save me from this quicksand
If i fits i sits
Fuckin luv dis 💋
That pillow is now the cat's.
Comfort follows concern.
Mom help...MOM HELP
Quicksand in all 70’s movies.

\*me trying out my new bed
The more times I see it, the deeper the kitten sunks 🙄
If i fits, i sinks.
"aww yiss"

Dive, Dive, Dive.
Ready for low profile sneak attack.
I didn't know I needed this. Thank you!

i wish i had a comfy pillow like that.
Camouflage hideout for his dasteredly plans.....




Of cuddles and love!

u/vredditshare
Adios!

This is my favorite
Ready for take off!
Foam will remember that.
“Hmm, what’s going OH SHIT oh nevermind it’s fine.”
That sweet baby doesn’t know what’s happening to it!
my heart just exploded ouch ouch ouch
Oh how I wish I was made out of memory foam so a kitten could shrink into me🥺
This reminds me of the kid that is lowered into the snacks and does the wiggly manoeuvre for maximum snack lift
and the band played on
OMG :3
He became the potato
Only half sunk because their engines are in the front.
Preparing for take-off.
Awwww his r/airplaneears when he realize he is in trouble
If I... uhh, fits.. then I.. wait, ok this is good... sits
The foam remembers the kitten!
I see a kind of calm and relaxation in its manner that resonates with the safety and warmness of the pillow
So cute!
"If I fits I... uh... if I stinks I sinks."
Kitten's reaction: "Oh. Oh! Oooooooh!!!!"
Comfy kitty
Umm... I want to be that kitten
I bet the foam will never forget that experience.
The kitten:Time to sleep ahhh.(calm)
Me:awww
Kitten:what the why am I sinking (fear)
Kitten again : Good bye (ok)
What happened
memory quick sand pillow
The booty is buoyant
Thats one heavy kitten.

I now need to see lots more things sink in to a memory foam pillow...especially more cats.
The foam and I are one!
Shit! No wait..... We cool!

pillow... must.... feast...
Captain, deploy the ear flaps for landing

I will never be this comfortable and I am offended
It’s gone into siege mode
FUCKING AWWW
Btw, memory foam mattresses are a god send.
Hes like "oh... Alright. imma fw it"
oh to be a kitten sinking into memory foam 🥺
You know the content is good when it's got multiple reddit awards you've never seen before.
I can only hope to one day achieve this level of comfort.
concern, CONCERN,..CONCERN!!!..comfort?!
How much does that spud weigh?
That is pure cosiness visualised
The cats like 

As I lay here

Going deep

I feel a great comfort on my feet

I feel so comfy I'm going to sleep

So of could be so kind as turn off the light

That would be a delight
Awww! My heart is melting just like the kitten into the pillow.
Why is his front heavier than his rear?
Cuuute!
I can watch this all day long
Me saying "just five more minutes "as I sink back into sleep
And there he goes
OH! Ooohhh....
OMG ! my wife said she thought the pillow was sand.
Best memory this pillow will ever have!
Submarine go brrr
skill is required by all.
It's like "aw, yeah, I like dis."
Me the first time I got my memory foam pillow
Ahhhhhhhhhh can’t handle!
Memory foam... all alone in the moonlight...

Stop being so damn cute!

Poor baby is so confused lol
this made my day :)
Oh My heart 😍
What kinda pillow is that? I want one for our window ledge cat bed!
Looks like my cat
Gfycat... Check.
this is so adorable I can’t even deal awwwwww 😍😍😍
Nah that kitten isn’t nearly heavy enough to cause a depression that deep.

Look at its body language: eyes wide, ears back, body low, hind legs planted firmly. This kitten is practicing their “pounce” pose. Owner is likely waving a toy off camera.

Bravo Six :
Got a memory foam pillow just after I adopted the cat I have now.  She's slept there on the top of my head every night since.
Epic😎
It’s like the beginning of Dumbo
Sooooo cutee

“Oh no. Aaaaaaa”
So adorable!
I WANNA LOVE IT FOREVER!!!
I want to be this cat right now....
An 8oz cannonball of pure dense mass.
Very cute!!
"I'll just check the basement"
Mmm snug
That pillow is a trap for that cat
Smoooooooosh mode activated in... 3...2...1....
"What are you sinking about?”
Ohmygosh, so cute and adorable!
that cat looks like my new 9 week old kitty, carbon copy
Kitty looks comfy
I've played to much d&d, my first thought was either a slime or mimic was eating that cat.
It remembers me!
Soo cute
This!
It’s suuu cuteeeeeeeeeee
That’s more like quicksand.

I really want to curl up next to that thing.
The ears going back made me feel like he was about to rocket blast off lol
That's a lot of floof.
And now children, observe what happens when water meets oil.
This... Does put a smile to my face
I’ll babysit for free
The cutest!!
Normally the cat changes to fit the container, but this time the container changed to fit the cat.
Aww little apricot ♥️
...becoming the pillow!
Consume the cat

This is the most comfortable thing I’ve ever seen
Who wouldn’t sink into a memory foam bed
Last time this was posted it was pointed out that this is just a pillow with a hole in the middle as you can see the divot before the kitty starts to lower itself in.
She is precious!
kitty submarine 😁
this is so adorable :3
And its journey to the cat dimension begins.
Purrfect.
Aww the kitten is so cute❤️
u/wrenco
I wonder if he remembers
that's a pillow with a hole in the middle covered with a blanket, not memory foam. memory foam doesn't even sink that much under a human's weight, never mind the negligible weight of a kitten.

Am I stopping yet?....😳
This pillow will have a good memory after this!)
Omg lol
Tom, where do you get all of the pictures that you post?
This be mah sinky spot!
Only on reddit do I believe people don't put covers on their pillows, or sheets on their mattresses
That's just wholesome.
I can practically hear the AAAHHHH coming outta the cat lol
He's like...what is this?  Oh, I'm becoming more stealthy by the second! Ears back!   Legs taught!
r/airplaneears
So that's where my kitten Bob keeps disappearing to.

(Seriously, we apparently have clones, granted, there's a lot of orange cats out there.)
Reminds me of my friend's 3 year old who will lie down anywhere soft and proclaim "I AM DONE!" and just sink in lol.

Save him
Stealth mode engaged
you know that reaction in your brain when something is so cute you want to pinch it? Yeah, that...
The ears do the "I know there is something wrong, but I don't know what, so I'm just gonna pretend everything is right."
Awwwww
He/she isn't sinking, they're docking in the same way R2 docks in an X wing
He is unsure, but then likes.
Was scrolling past and 100% thought you said Meowmory foam
So satisfying to watch 😂
Kawaii🥰
Oh God, this is heaven.......
my kitten looks exactly like yours
I WANT IT
It's too cute, lol.
This is a good camouflage for the fearsome one
Haha
I don't know if I'm tired or pissed off . Let's try tired first and see .
Memory. All alone in the moonlight.
Me when I'm in bed and don't want to get up. 😂
At least the kitty will not be bothered by all the body heat that stuff retains.
“So this is my fate...”
Looks fantastic
That’s the best!
It's a Tempurrpedic.
That’s the equivalent to my cat on my stomach.

Help it it’s drowning in comfort
