We had a cat with a scarred face in my neighborhood too. We called him ‚ÄúLeroy Brown‚Äù cause he was the baddest cat in the whole damn town.

Voldemort cat. Will 100% pet.
Everyone is welcome in Goodneighbor.
Going by how happy and healthy this cat looks, I'm guessing it was some kind of expensive surgery and that this cat is very loved by it's owners.

At least I hope that is the case.
Reminds me of a ghoul from fallout
How does he smell?

Terrible!
Monty Python joke:

This cat has no nose.

How does he smell?

Awful!

But he does look like a handsome fella! 
Awe, Poor Lil fella.  


Mr. Potato Head should donate a nose to him. 
Awww poor baby! If he‚Äôs friendly you could try to catch him and take him to the vet. 
Bless his heart. I know he‚Äôs just a cat but that look seems to say a lot. 
He‚Äôs definitely seen some shit but looks like he still has a pure heart
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Tamed!
I zoomed all the way into his nose hole.

What is wrong with me.
Does he ever get a kibble stuck in his nose? 
Maaaaa!
He's on life # 8.
Wow, that's quite a cat.

Also, /r/specialaww
Full name should be Voldemort Van Gough
Am I an asshole if I think that‚Äôs just terrifying?
Think that‚Äôs bad, you should see the other cat. 
Realized he gets no more boops and now I'm super bummed out.
Poor cat :( 
Don‚Äôt zoom on the nose.
Btw do you have any idea of when he lost his nose?
Where are the horcruxes for his nine lives?
He reminds me of a ghoul from Fallout
Hey smoothskin.
Omgosh..so cute. I have a baggie of pink plastic kitty noses from when my daughter was little and her stuffed kitty had to have his noses and eyes replaced every so often throughout the years of being well loved.( funny story..I once unknowingly bought bear eyes for him, instead of cat eyes. He looked like dialated crack kitty! It took us a bit to figure out what exactly looked weird about the eyes..haha) I could just pop a little prosthetic pink nose in for kitty from my bag of snoots!! Of course I am joking. But it would fit into his little snoot hole quite well! Give that kitty some lovins from a cat lady in the USA!!
Meowchael Jackson 
What do you call a guy who has no body and just a nose?

..nobody knows!
I‚Äôm fascinated by this cat. Does he still breathe through the hole? Could a bug crawl inside his head? Can you see inside his mouth? So many damn questions 
I love cats and all but this is not r/aww worthy tbh
Voldemeow
Nobody else is going to do it? Fine, here goes..... How does he smell?
Wie riecht er?

Looks like a good boy
r/PiratePets
A bit terrifying but wonderful to hear he‚Äôs so sweet after suffering so much 
One of the sweetest cats in my neighborhood was born with a cleft palate and only one eye. This picture reminded me of Daisy Mae a lot.
Call him Tom! It‚Äôd be a bit of a Riddle. 
10/10 would pet Voldemort kitty. I'd stop and talk to him and bring him treats every day too, because he looks like he deserves them.
I mean... we could also call him George

Edit: George not Fred omfg

/r/piratepets
I can hear him meowing "Smoothskin" at me.
Zoomed into nose, definitely would not recommend 
Tom Cat Riddle. 
Upvoting with extreme emphasis for survival mechanisms. And because he is cute as hell and I would feed him chicken and rice and snuggle him in my bed because HE DESERVES IT. 
Aww poor angel.. that‚Äôs great that he has people to look out for him though :)
HEY SMOOTHSKIN WHAT YOU LOOKIN' AT, NEVER SEEN A GHOUL BEFORE?
tragic suffering does seem to tend towards the creation of deep compassion (in humans too)

those eyes are so yellow.
Super late but "Voldemeowrt". 
He‚Äôs been hurt badly and he still trust people?! That‚Äôs amazing! I love him 
Gotta admit this pulls on my heartstrings. I'd love every cat just the same of course but this (likely) is no birth defect. Something happened and it hurts me to know this little guy was suffering hardcore for a while.  Glad he seems fine now though! It's super cool to know its really friendly as well as if all the troubles in its life just.. doesn't mean much and he can still trust other beings :)
Accio, sweet kitty ü§óüò∏
Omg. Is he okay without a nose?
how much to get him a prosthetic nose?
Voldemeowrt
I had a cat just like this called Amy. She was a rescue and already missing her nose when we got her.
She was suuuuuper affectionate and always wanted to cuddle which was great. What was less great was that because she was missing most of her nose she was always a lil snotty and she had a tendency to sneeze a whole lot. 
And because of the shape of her nose her sneezes were like... Snot blunderbusses. Woe betide you if she wanted a cuddle while you were eating. Your food was gonna get coated in a thin film of cat boogersin about 0.3 microseconds.

Rip Amy you were badass
Oh god that made me nauseous to look at. This is more r/awwtf
I mean don't get me wrong..he is a gorgeous kitty, and I'm so happy he is so loved..
But..the hole üò∞ I'm terrified of holes. 
I would definitely cuddle and pet him, though.

Poor kittie.  Hope you spoil him/her rotten with treats and pets.
aw...  sweetie... he has seen some pain.
That is so unsettling. But would still pet 10/10
Why is the cat missing a nose and an ear?üò¢
When I worked at Petsmart there was a rescue dog that came in on the weekend to be adopted out and his nose was similar, but it was just a weird hole on top his snout. His name was Dolphin because it looked like a blowhole lol he was the happiest little doggo! 
I am Voldemort cat = Tom Morvaca Tidle

That's a veteran of multiple great cat wars.
Aww!!! Poor little cat has all my love‚ù§
I love him...
Ruined my morning
Don't you mean Tomcat Riddle?
He's wonderful :D

Keep an eye on his amputations. It's easy for animals to get infections & infestations, particularly bot flies in the nose. The ear is likely to get very dirty, unless it somehow got sealed during amputation.

I guess that means more snuggles while you check him over, oh schucks.
‚ÄúMy cat has no nose.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow does he smell?‚Äù

‚ÄúTerrible!‚Äù
Can someone please photoshop the remaining ear to the exact center of the top of his head? Thank you.

How is this on aww? Shit needs to be on nsfl.
That's one ugly cat.
His nose looks hard to clean & it‚Äôs open enough for debris & bacteria to get stuck. I hope he regularly goes to the vet for real. 
He spends his time going from inner-city school to school, teaching children about the abuses of drugs and alcohol.

I love it. But watch him. Unfortunate as it is, there are evil people out there and malformed animals are prime targets for them
What happens if he gets something in his nose hole..? The ear could be stitched over but wouldn't they want like a tiny cover for it so poor babe doesn't get pebbles, dirt, and bugs inside it.
Sadly a plague of the white cat who is a sun worshipper (I had one who had lost half an ear and was starting to get cancer on his nose)  unfortunately while he was sun bathing on my driveway an idiot in a big truck came flying up my driveway (wrong address-going to neighbors to see his boxer pups) and ran over my cats leg before he could get out of the way (he was 12 and didn't move as fast as he used to.)

That started him on a downhill road with a couple of surgeries and sadly gone about a year later.

Here is his last Christmas (I positioned the hat to cover his ear) and he has one missing leg in the back but still down for Christmas! [https://i.imgur.com/r5Or52R.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/r5Or52R.jpg)

I gotta search for one that shows more.

But I love this guy anyway too, cuz he reminds me of my Billy!
Fight the good fight, kitty.

Poor little guys snoot got booped
Goddamn Jack Bauer. You really are the man
Can we get r/3dprinting to hook him up?

My childhood home also had a neighborhood cat who had no nose. My neighbors to the right would rent their house and for a while about 4 families went through pretty quickly and the cat would stay. I‚Äôm not sure whose it originally was but he came with the house. 
More like r/eww



And before you ask, no, I have not heard that a lot 
The kitty they call "Voldemort"
(Because he's an ear and nose short,)
Isn't  Wizard, nor Witch,
No dog, and no bitch,
He's a cat of the friendliest sort.

BTW. The way the leaves are angled in the background where his missing ear would be make it look like he has a brown ear.
He who must not be tamed...
That name is not friendly at all.
I also like the sound of Voldemeowt
I‚Äôm sorry if this has been asked already but I couldn‚Äôt see it, do you know if Voldemort has a home? 
Curiosity tried, 7 lives to go.
Spoopy but i love him
I would love him forever. Wonder if the cat needs any special attention to prevent debris from getting into the area? 
Oh no. Is the nose triggering anyone else‚Äôs trypophobia..?? :(
If I see that cat in my yard it‚Äôs getting a fake nose 
bOOPS, your nose fell off!
He‚Äôs cute. Voldesnort maybe ?
Hey there, smooth fur
Poor lil dude
Sweet boy! I call mine fuzzymodo 
I'd call him "Trooperl".
What a tough cat - and like you said - still be friendly and happy.
Wonderful to have you to give him TLC as a neighbor
I like him :3 
Omg, Kitty Rourke 
What does one do when there is no snoot to boop?
Did someone do the thumb nose thing and never give it back to him?
Oh my God! Is this real? üò´ Poor guy!
I agree about not putting it down, but I just didn‚Äôt know if the cat would be uncomfortable. You would think he would be if he didn‚Äôt have a nose. Also how to make sure the cat didn‚Äôt get an infection where his nose was. 
That's one Bad ass cat still cute though, I had a cat 20 years ago one eyed black cat I dunno why he has panther spots when in the sunlight, that's when I knew not all black cats are totally black I named him unlucky... my cuddly cat and when I eat chips he swats the chip off my fingers lands on the floor and eat it. 
That nose hole is making me cringe very hard. Especially when I can see the inside
Tomcat Riddle
My cats like to bump/poke their noses on me a few times before going in for the head bumps. Does this little dude try to bump you with his face hole? Or is he head shy now? Or maybe my cats are total bozos.

Aww poor fella :( ... is there anything that can be 3D printed to maybe stop things from getting in his nose? 
I got my friend into reddit just now and she signed up. This was the first thing she saw lol. 
My dad would always tell a joke:

‚ÄúYa know, I once had a cat with no nose.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo nose? Good lord how did he smell?!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh not too bad, he was just a little cat.‚Äù

:)
Battle scars..
Do you know what happened to him? :( 
You know, if you take away the nose and ears and fur and legs, cats are a lot like snakes
I once had a neighborhood cat with a total of 3/4 of an ear and missing a leg. We called her tripod. She was the sweetest cat you'd ever meet. Just want some food and some scratches. 
‚ÄúHey, Smoothskin‚Äù
Should have named him Vincent Van Goghldemort. 
Poor thing. Is he homeless? Could you help him?
Oh my heart :(
friendly as in... he tries to rub what's left of his head on your leg?
Aww but dear shit if i saw him i would freak out then feel bad about it
 Cant they put a prosthetic on? Im worried about his snoot getting dirt in it

"Haha I got your nose!"

"Fuck you terry..."
‚ÄúMA!! There‚Äôs a weird fuckin‚Äô cat out here!!‚Äù
So, how does he smell?
The most deveatating thing though is when you give an animal out in the wild a nickname and finally learn their real name. We have a cat in our apartment who is 'Street cat' and he's a tough guy who fights crime and protects our apartment complex from all things bad. This is in comparison to our cat who stays in doors and is legitimately scared of grass and birds. 

Turns out 'Street cat' is a girl cat named lilly and strangely enough my partner and I are still mildly annoyed about that for some reason (like jeez she is soooo not a Lilly how could they call her that) 
That‚Äôs a little on the nose
 The nicest cat ever was this black stray cat who walked up to me. 

 Basically, as he got closer I could tell something wasn‚Äôt right. I soon noticed he was severely wounded from his neck down to his front legs. I could see the muscles in his neck, and his rib cage and tendons in his legs. It was fucking awful, and somehow he had no blood except near his neck where he couldn‚Äôt lick. 

 I‚Äôve never seen an animal so nice. He came up to me and just purred forever. I rushed home and got him dog food, bacon, water, shirts, milk, and some first aid. I was poor as hell and knew my mother would be pissed if she knew I grabbed all the stuff. So I hid it while trying to find help and feed him. 

 Fast forward two days later of me just taking care of him before my mom comes out into the apartment complex looking for me. Wondering where so much stuff went missing. She didn‚Äôt believe me when I described the cat, but I made her follow me. 

 Her jaw dropped on how injured he was. Later that night my aunt who is a cat person was visiting us from out of state, and the first thing we did is show her the cat I was calling Spunky. 

 My aunt just lost her 25 year old cat IIRC, and so brought him to the vet. 3,500$ upfront later, and a bunch of other bills for follow up Spunky was patched up and taken home with her. He had a punctured lung, broken ribs, pulse was weak, was dying of infection, ripped muscles everywhere, and (had) to be in so much pain that the vet thought it would be better to put him down. 

 He lived an other twelve years and was forever the nicest cat ever. He was more like a dog, honestly. 

 No idea what happened to him. The vet said a car hit him, but the wounds really did look like an animal attack. I always figured a dog or one of the huge raccoons got at him. 
 
 I always wondered who owned him before and what happened. Yet he was seriously the friendliest cat ever no matter what. The most he would have done is just furiously lick your eyes and inside your nose if he was mad at you, because he knew people hated it. 

 

 

 
I volunteered at an animal shelter that used to have cats like this (ASAP in Santa Barbara).  Its skin cancer which usually happens to cats with pink ears and nose.  Typically white cats will have that so if your cat has pink ears or nose keep them out of the sun.


Also cats know when they don't like pretty.  People will give them nasty looks which makes them shy. They know, so please don't be nasty to them.
People saying they would pet it are lying they just say that for karma

I bet he stuck his nose somewhere it didn‚Äôt belong
I'm really really sorry but there's nothing aww about this unfortunately deformed cat. I can see inside it's head and that's gross. 
Poor thing, who did this to him?

Aww, poor kitty. Without a nasal hood to protect it from the elements, how does the little guy breathe? Genuine question. :(
Your naming skills are noted, young patawon 
My friend‚Äôs cat, Dapper Dan, had a similar nose. 

This cat probably feels pretty normal and is in no pain. 

Most likely a vet removed a cancerous growth and while his face may not be pretty to look at anymore, the cat‚Äôs still alive, enjoying good quality of life. 

Dapper Dan‚Äôs cancer eventually got him but his owners enjoyed every day they had with their no-nose boy while he was still feeling good. 
My cat has no nose!

*How does it smell?*

Awful.

[Real talk:  I‚Äôd give hella snuggles to this cat.]
I certainly hope you, (or someone) adopts him and he lives out the rest of his years in peace.

Looks, to me, like he's been through enough hell already.
Okay seriously, why is it we can't post "sad" content in the form of "found this poor girl abandoned in the desert" but we can post "sad" content in the form of "look at this poor girl with all these horrible injuries from being abandoned in the desert"?

this is actually disturbing.

Can the cat get an infection or further complications because of the nasal cavity being exposed? 
The cat who must not be named
We‚Äôve named the ferals in our hood; one is Beyonc√© since she‚Äôs a survivor because she lost her tail and ran around with just her tail bones hanging for a hot minute and the other one is Felicia for which is short for bye Felicia since she runs away whenever you come near. I love them kitties. 
I don't care what a kitty looks like, that cat is getting pets!!
iPhone "portrait mode" makes this image look fake because the transition between blur & fur is so weird.

If you zoom in you can tell it's like the cat is on a distinct different layer compared to the background,
as the background was blurred artificially.
Does he belong to anyone?  If not, why the heck not?  You can tell he‚Äôs had a hard life and he should be spoiled and snuggled up in a extra soft cat bed. 
I don't think you'd photoshop a cat to look like this but zooming in on the ear it looks quite fake... its weird

Don't call him Voldemort, call him Michael Jackson! 
Do their noses just pop off leaving a clean round hole?? 
Does the cat have breathing problems without the frontal nose part? If so, would it be possible to build him a little replacement nose? It would be neat to see a 3D-printed or silicone prosthetic that would help him breathe if he needed it!
If he has no nose, how does he smell?
Poor guy. But he looks pretty healthy other wise and the missing parts look pretty clean, likely a pet. You should post on NextDoor and see if you can get his story. Then update us of course. 
So this stays but when someone posts a blind cat it gets removed for being too sad. And when a kitten gets its face shoved in yogurt the mods defend it.
Now that's a nose for cocaine
 Voldermort definitely lost a she-cat that night. Listening to "beat it" would have been useful, so sorry for him.
This cat has seen some shit. 
Ghoulified cat from fallout.
Cute but I was thinking he looks more like a Seuss character. 
He needs a tiny pompom or something over the hole. Perhaps a googly eye.
This is just depressing. 
What happened to the pieces of him that are missing?

Hey there Smooth Skin 
he looks like a child‚Äôs old soft toy, and the thread that sewed its nose and ears came loose so they fell off, but the owner still loves it anyway,
Hey look it‚Äôs handcock 
Look at this at 100% size. Why the weird pixel ghosted fringed areas next to his missing ear? Is this a faked photo? Hmmm?
He is hollowing. 
Any hole is a goal 
It‚Äôs interesting how our intuition is that it‚Äôs cute and fitting to call a cat with this condition ‚ÄúVoldemort,‚Äù but it would be incredibly insulting and offensive had this cat been a human being. 
Shouldn‚Äôt that be patched up or something? 
Whoah whoah whoah. Someone gave me gold for this? Thank you, kind benefactor! I shall honour you with praise to [Voldemort](https://i.imgur.com/kzlHWKs.jpg). 
I hope he belongs to someone and they're taking care of him. I would keep him inside.

Awe!! What a little sweetie!! üòçüòçüòçüòçüíïüíïüíïüíï
I wanna give him one of those nose filter stickers to keep ickies out of the hole. Looks like he‚Äôs pretty healthy otherwise! 
I wonder how he lost his nose
Meowdemort. 
Reminds me of that marksman from Boardwalk empire with the mask. I should watch BE again because I didn't finish last time
Aww, I wonder what happened to the little guy
"That's Lord Voldemeowt to you!"
Ghoul cat 
I LOVE him...and the name!
I'd pet him all day
 New James Bond Villain 

Ohhh scary but cute poor guy i want to give him infinite plus infinite hugs 
How ... how do we boop him?
Hey there, smoothskin 
Voldesnort
I love him
I love disfigured or broken kitties, one of my kitties has half an ear. This one is adorable.
He‚Äôs a handsome fellow.
Makes me üò¢ 
Have you tried putting a Mr. Potato Head nose in the nose hole?

Tyrion Meownnister.
Should‚Äôve called him Vincent Van Voldemort
I want him to come live with me!!
Meowldemort
Harru dogger. The pup who lived. Come to die
He looks perpetually disappointed in your life decisions...
Khajiit ghoul has wares for sale
Poor kitty, he's unboopable
That‚Äôs a fucked up name
I say he was a warrior
It's the CANSA!
r/piratepets
How does he smell?
So a maimed cat gets to the front page, but the mods remove posts with things like "cat born with no eyes" which, since it was born that way, is probably happier than this one. Ok then.
bit terrifying at first sight but cute to the second :)
Poor baby, he is still a cutie, and I can totally imagine him being such a cuddle bug.  Just remember that he is "He who must not be named" or...  "He who must be petted".
The portrait mode artifacts make him look even stranger. 
9 lives. 9 horcruxes. Yup, that's Voldemort alright. 
Post this on /r/PiratePets they will love it!
ok
What a cutie!!
Tom Meowvolo Riddle would have been better, mate. 
Is he a Tom cat?
It's he who shall not be photographed and uploaded to Reddit!
"Mickey Mouse. The mouse who lived has come to die"

I'm sure he's sweetheart. üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
He‚Äôs missing a nose and an ear because he‚Äôs so friendly. He‚Äôs not aggressive to other cats so they fuck him up.
This little boy rides the imperfections on his sleeve and looks pretty af still. mad speck
The cat who shall not be named.

What kind of torture has this cat endured?
Yea he seems like a Voldemort
He needs a home 
Severe frost bit is my **guess** how Mr/Ms kitty lost their parts. Where do you live?
Fuckin smoothskins - cat
"got any kibbles smoothskin?" 
I will never be able to unfeel what this is making me feel üôÅ poor child
How does he smell?
I hope nobody also calls him He Who Must Not Be Named in reference to your naming of him. I can only wonder what happened to this precious kitty to lose his nose, though.
Hes kind of got a nose
what happened to him?
What a boss
Thats a gaper!
Poor bub :( 
The cat who shall not be named
Feral ghoul kitty!
Poor baby
He must not be named!
Hey smooth skin

Hope Voldemort can breathe and smell properly! 
voldemort
How does he smell?
Schroedinger's cat
> Rose, took my nose, I suppose
Had to zoom in to see what was inside. 
The bush in the background kinda looks like the shape of an ear so I didn‚Äôt notice even he was missing one
r/piratepets
MA !
Cats have nine lives but Voldemort had seven horcruxes. I wonder how would that add up here...
I honestly love him.
I wonder if it nose?
Oo idk if I think that‚Äôs cute 
Voldemort Van Gogh
Fuck that's a good name
The tree in behind the cat, makes it almost look like he  has an ear still...! Had to do a double take.

Tom Riddle would've been cuter but such an adorable ball of fur nonetheless! Much love. 
So loved!
r/PiratePets
Whats wrong with himüò∞
I need to look in it...
He is beautiful 
Hopefully someone adopts the poor guy!!
"Hey smooth-skin" 
Or s/he could be a Founder, like Odo.
I bet he smells bad
That cat is a rare type of beautiful

Looks a teeny bit like the Grinch 
Voldemewort

Voldemeow
Voldemort Van Gogh
He's had a hard life and I love him
Do you know what happened to his nose or was he born like that?
You dare speak the Dark Lord‚Äôs name?!!
r/piratepets
HE WHO SHALL NOT BE NAMED!!!
Poor guy. Must be awful. Looks happy tho
U shouldn‚Äôt say that!
I wonder if there are other neighborhood cats who don‚Äôt think he is the friendliest ever. 
Give him extra scratches for me 
Why do you call him voldemort
Sorta reminds me of a ghoul from the Fallout games. Cute kitty though none the less.
Wholesome fluffer
wooooooow lmao voldemort
Tom Cat Riddle? 
Master Splinter
Drugs are bad Mkay
Also Tom would've been neat
Ssshhhh. He's "He Who Must Not be Named"
You named your cat after Voldemort?!?! Name that cat Krillin, damn it.
Awww.. I hope the neighborhood takes care of him...
Tom Riddle would be better
Reminds of that character from Titan AE. I think his name is like Scud or something.
You dare speak the Dark Lord's name? Arrogant little mudblood üò†
You might wanna like not leave a gaping hole in the cats face. 
Not gonna lie, I'm sure he's nice, and would pet and own, but that'd take some getting used to. 
We all love him already. Wish we could match kitty play dates! No really, cuz I want a kitty so bad! He‚Äôs beyond adorable, so happy you came into each other‚Äôs lives 
Cokecat 
That cat has seen some shit.
When I was a kid, there was a stray in my neighborhood that was missing most of an ear, we called it Holyfield.
I LOVE HIM
I'd call him Voldersnort. 
I love him 
üòû ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Moldy Voldy, I'd give you a pet.
he still emits godly energy nonetheless 
now less than 9
There is a back story here, & I want to read it.
He‚Äôs seen some things man, and some stuff. 
This cat will give me nightmares
Tomcat Riddle
Voldemeow 
If he works out he'll be swoledemort
How does he smell?
"You can't just ask him why he doesn't have a nose, Harry" 
Would his nose become infected easily? Or...the inside of his nose? Or where it used to be? How would he keep that clean?
Is he just the neiborhood cat? 
Poor thing must've seen some fights.
