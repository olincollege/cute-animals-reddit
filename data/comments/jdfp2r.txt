Pure joy.
I so want to know how good it feels for dogs to get scratched.  Has anyone asked a dog about this?
This never fails to make me smile
Oh my God who turned my boyfriend into a dog??
Such a cute doggo
The most gorgeous dog! üòçüòçüòç
That smile could light a whole room up.
Have goldens just been bred to be pure, derpy love?

My Goodest boy is concerned at the level of scritches. My performance evaluation came in substandard.
Anyone know why dogs have evolved to LOVE belly rubs and to a lesser extent had scritches? I know people tend to exaggerate certain claims but I can honestly say in my 25 years of life, 90%+ of dogs that I've seen and interacted with are obsessed with them. I wonder what traits selected for this
Handsome fella
This is why doggos are the best
Every time I hear or read the word scritches, I just think of the Twitch deer lady making unholy moaning shrieks when having her head scratched.
That face is of pure joy
Love that dopey face
Bro this is literally on the top of all time posts on this sub

What the hell is a "scritch??"
Golden smiles = hooman smiles
Thank you!
Do people actually think dogs smile?
So cute! My husky does the same! Rotten I swearüòú
IB4 some smartass saying "bUt tHats nOt a sMiLe"


What in the hell does that look like then lol.
Honestly, anyone who says dogs don't emote or have feelings is a liar and a half. It's absurd to think dogs don't have feelings.
He‚Äôs totally smiling. I love doggies
I don‚Äôt understand people that just let their dogs lick them. Nasty...
Yes.
I wanna pet himm!
Give me the dog for five days he will get all the head scratches
So freaking wholesome.
= instant old lady smiles
I can't describe the love I have for dogs. They're just...PERFECT!

His face when he stopped though.
So I'm apparently beyond exhausted I read the caption as "head scritches= instant golden missile" lol

I wonder what the dark bump is on pups snout?
Head scratches from a loved one feels amazing, it doesn't matter what species you are!
Seriously, I can't imagine someone watching this without smiling
Now that, is a happy dog.
I love your fingers! - Dog
Ahh yes there... Right there human!!!!!!...

Dogs are better than fake friends

Same reaction when you give your girlfriend on her period chocolates
My joy is immeasurable and my day became perfect.

I'm pretty sure this is because it releases endorphins to their brain.

HOW
Do dogs really smile or is that just us humanizing animals?
So adorable!!! The dogs pretty cute too. üòâ
With that smile, who doesn't want to keep doing this forever and ever? üíì

What breed is the dog?
Dog: I ain't giving these smiles away for nothing. Gotta earn these smiles
Can I have some scritches too?

There needs to be more videos like this in the world. It's so positive and feel-good.

Sorry but that dog is stressed
That's a stress response, not a smile.
Honest question, but why don't people trim their dog's fur? I know dogs don't sweat like humans and so they perspiration works inhaling cold hair through their mouth.   


Am I missing something? Wouldn't it just be super better for the dog since they won't be baked?
If only I were as happy as this doggo.
