I‚Äôm no zoologist, but I‚Äôve heard that chimps don‚Äôt hug as a greeting, it‚Äôs their communication of fear...
Brothers don't shake hands! Brothers gotta hug!
Wow this is too pure for this world 
My heart just exploded with all kinds of emotions watching that. 
Source? I bet the story behind this is different than the subject.
Trauma bonding...these are stolen monkeys. I dont support this
This is not priceless, it's incredibly sad. They are desperately clinging to each other out of fear. They should be with their moms. Primatologists have commented on this video in the past, they are too young to be separated and are scared.
And that my friends, is brotherly love
I doubt these two are brothers.

Chimps give birth to one young at a time, and these two are the same size (and thus the same age), so they‚Äôre more likely just friends.

And aside from the fact chimps make horrible pets, the illegal trade in poached chimps is really a byproduct of the bushmeat trade (shoot the adults for meat and maybe there are some babies left), and it doesn‚Äôt extend into the US. 
The kisses at the end!
Didn't someone post on the other thread of apes hugging that, that's a sign of nervousness not happiness.
r/LikeUs 
this is from 2016 and it has nothing to do with being rescued. Stop making stuff up.
The title reads exactly like a Buzzfeed headline/title...
Incredible! I hope they stay reunited! 
Tears police... yeah this post right here
Oh my heart.  Too precious. 
So, how did the caretakers know those to chimps were related when they were at the separate facilities? Were the previously chipped or something??


I'm not trying to be facetious, I'm genuinely curious on how the NGOs figured it out. 
This reminds me of every time my son runs and gives me a giant hug. There's nothing better. 

How the hell did I get sand in my eyes...
Two brothers. In a van.
This gif has been posted a hundred times with a hundred different stories. Yeah it's cute, but OP has no clue what's going on and is full of shit. 
Jesus god how can anyone experiment on primates.  Just despicable.
I'm not crying. You're crying. 
Chimps should be reclassified as Homo Troglodytes and given human rights protections, dammit! 
monkeys on leashes always gives me a weird discomfort feeling 
Don‚Äôt chimps usually only give birth to one young at a time? They‚Äôre the same age so I doubt that they‚Äôre brothers. I also doubt that legit rescue facilities would leash train chimps.
If these primates can feel the horror and pain of separation and the joy and relief of reunification, how much more so would our fellow human beings? And how worthless is it to contrive any distinction between races or nationalities? 
Yeah I'm gonna need a longer video please.
Oh, sure, but when I kiss my brother on the mouth, all of a sudden it's "traumatizing" to his "wife" and "children". Double standards.

I swear I'll never eat monkey again.
Awwwwwwwww. They look like monchichi.

What‚Äôs an NGO?
I thought last time this was reposted people said this is a reaction from stress. Op what is your source so we can confirm please?
I work with two troops of chimpanzees 9 hours a day, been doing it nearly six years. These beautiful creatures are so like us its uncanny. Their range of emotions, thought processes, group politics are absolutely fascinating. First job I've had I love to go to every morning and I see myself doing it until I'm too old to carry on.
What‚Äôs the current story with them?  They didn‚Äôt separate them again right?  RIGHT?
I wish I knew someone who loved me this much. Lol

Me when I meet another black person when travelling abroad
My brother got mugged last night, and this really hit me. He got 3 fractures: two in his head and one in his face. I love the guy so much, and he's had a lot of bad shit happen to him recently. He was so sad telling me how he was sorry and that he fucked up. He's a good guy and doesn't deserve any of it. I'm gonna tell him how much I love him and take him on a bro date this week.
This made my Sunday night, how beautiful.
This is a display of sentient animals. Animals do have feelings and memories. This is a prime example. Stop animal testing!

I will never not have the time to stop and watch a video of baby monkey brothers hugging, or a baby elephant taking his first steps and learning how to walk, or two dogs playing tetherball. Thank you Reddit.
They have a strong bond!

Yeah, but animals are food, right?
Take off those leashes! They'll be happier together
Find someone who will hug you as tight as those 2 adorables

This is actually adorably fuckin sad. I've rescued two sets of sibling cats and I kept them all because I didnt want to separate them. People can be heartless thinking animals dont have feelings. 
i wonder  the reaction from the staff when they saw that
Any proof these are brothers?  Maybe just playmates! 

TWO BROTHERS
Bro, the cameras.  Yeah.  
Cute when babies, but adult chimps are the stuff of nightmares
This more sad then funny lol these monkeys been through it
Those things will tear you to shreds
Plz don't tell me they were split up again
Better every loop 
Wow, this made me want to go hug the brother I never had. Guess my cat will have to suffice. This is such an awesome moment.
This is just fills my heart with such joy
I thought they were lovers until I read the title
It‚Äôs like seeing a sibling that you love an care for many years later.

They used to work at the same company and run into each other here and there, so they were familiar with each other before being reunited for a 60 Minutes special and giving each other a hug
This is probably the saddest thing I‚Äôve seen for a while. Makes me feel horribly for the ones who never see each other again. They totally 100% suffer when they lose their family - :(

We need laws which increase protection (legal status of) for sentient beings like monkeys, elephants, delfines etc. We can‚Äôt continue causing this level of suffering, it‚Äôs just not sustainable and justifiable.
Sceptic here...chimp twins are exceedingly rare. In all the time Dr Jane Goodall studied chimps she recorded only three sets, and usually,  one of the set will perish. This generates a nice fuzzy warm feeling and all, but i call bullshit.

How rare are multiple births with chimps! That alone sets off the BS alarms.
