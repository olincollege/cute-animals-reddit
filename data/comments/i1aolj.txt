Such a sweet boy!
He probably knew his head wouldn't fit in that space.
I love dogs so much
Boopable!!
my 12-year-old black lab, jude recently died and this made me cry
The best senior citizen dog.
"Like dis?"
So cute!
I accidentally trained my dog to gently rest her precious chin on me somewhere when she wants a treat or to play. 

Sometimes the precious chin just hovers.
He tried so haaaaaaard, and got so faaaaaaaaaar!

But in the ennnnnnnnnnnnnnnnd it was still adorabllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllle!
He tried his best, and we’ll take it
A heckin snoot restin
My heart cant take it 🥺

Is that a lamb chop toy in the background?!
I swear goldens are angels from heaven.
old goldies have my heart
Is that a lamb chops?
I believe that's the correct way to do it.
Love that shit!  What a pleaser!
We don’t deserve dogs🥰
Way cuter!
Congrats your dog loves you!
So adorable.
I thought he was going to put his paw through it and I was going to be amazed. He still warmed my heart though
Cheap pops repost.
goldens have such a gentle and angelic look to them, especially the older ones 💖
Aww he is adorable
Stop playing with your hands and give me scritches.
Is it possible to teach a cat this? I'm going home for the holidays and will be seeing my cat again. It would be so cute
This is so pure and cute. Please smooch his head for me
I see nothing wrong here
Old dogs, new tricks, and absolute love.  Beautiful.
I just went to visit my aunt her dog Reggie stole peoples shoes when he waited attention i wish I got it on video it was adorable
I wanna hug him so bad.
I recognized your u/ from a mile away unicorn lol
This is the cutest, sweetest thing I’ve ever seen. Brought actual tears to my eyes, dogs are just the best 🥰😭
Who else thought he was gonna tri-beam the dog? Please, tell me I’m not the only one... pls
Not gonna lie, but from the thumbnail I thought this was about something else.
Man's best friend :)
u/unicornglitteryblood

That was so cute it hurt.

I literally said "AWWWW" at a much more enthusiastic level than I thought I would. 

We SO don't deserve doggos!
My dog will only play with lamb chop stuffies. She is only 10 lbs and has a bunch of small ones. We bought her a bigger one like your dog has and she proudly carries it around and it is her favorite.
Sweet boy. Made me smile.
I sent this to my sister who wasnt feeling too good and it lit up her face.
What a sweetheart!
I could feel my heart melt
I would die for him.
Hilarious and cute ❤️
What do you mean? Lol. He nailed it perfectly 😍
"Treat please!"

This way he can still open his mouth for the treats!
Aww he's old huh
Actually made me LOL too cute!
At his age, he knows better
Aww good boy!
He's doing his best
so gentle!
How are u holding your phone?
How much??
He didn’t try that hard.
perfection
I watched this way too many times thinking that they were all different videos of the pup trying to go between her hands before I realized that it just kept looping
The human did it wrong tho! He was angled down and doggo tried to put his snoot in and couldn't cause it was at an angle!
beautiful!
I love him.
I tried this and my dog decided to lick my thumbs.
Most of the time my pup would just walk up and start licking my hands haha

He is so cute, love the silver face.
What an adorable goof Ball
to oldskool for that millennial shit
He didn't want to be forceful. Too gentle
A++ for effort!
"I got this, I got this...YES!"

Hey, you have our TV stand! West Elm?
Only a fool would put their snout right in front of the hands. 

He's smart enough to stop [your attack](https://youtu.be/AOd0Cx3GuUk?t=10).

This is unbearably cute!
I literally just said Aww unprovoked!
Awww sweeet ol' lad.

A subreddit should be made for old golden retrievers it could be oldengolden seniorretriver oldiegoldie idk but it needs to be a thing
So cute
Goldens are so sweet and adorable and also occasionally kinda ditzy. They’re definitely blondes lol
Chin rest
Good dog!  And nice mid century sideboard/credenza!
Yeah he really wasn’t able to rip out his heart and put it in your hands god that’s a defective dog
Our old boy loves his lamby too!
I love old puppers! My parents took in Martha who was deaf and blind and very old German Shepard. She only lasted a year but I have never been more proud of my parents and she was so lovable
Is that supposed to be a kidney?
That boy deserves infinits love
Hi
Hes like "I wanna no wait I think its supposed to be here but my nose won't fit that cant be right... ah screw it. First choice FTW"
This...does out a smile on my face
Good dog! Give treat!
Best boi ever
Awww he wants a chin scritch
Dude be careful. Tien did some major damage to Cell using that technique.
Dumb dogs are the best dogs.
*cries*

***good enough...***
aww
Old boi
He also got so far
Just wanted to say I have that same lamb for my puppers :)
Aaawww, so so cute!!
Tried so hard 

And got so far

And in the end

He doesn’t even pet her
Thats so awesome! What's his name?
Aww. My golden was born with poor eyesight so he would probably just accidentally barrel into me. Lol
Golden retrievers are so precious.
A for effort
He got it right, from now on, that's the thing we hope for.
Goldens love to rest their chins on stuff
Where have your thumbs been ಠ_ಠ
I'm sure I've seen this before
I thought you were gonna hit him with a kikoho
I’m crying I want a dog so bad
Shintenshin no jutsu
Meanwhile, my dog runs away from me whenever I try to do it
This is a very cute one for r/animalsbeingderps
Awwwwwwww
He got the trick right.
What a wholesome video.

You see that white badge around his face, that’s the elder patch of fur that says “homie don’t play that.”

You just see doggo processing, “now younger me would get my nose caught in human hands, how naive I was.”
Oh look, it'a another Golden Retrievurr.

You RENEGAYDE, you. You utter, uncompromising INDIVIDUELLIST.
Lamb Chop!
Our Ty has that lamb chop baby too!
Awe. That’s adorable.
Awww he tried !
Elderly Goldens are the cutest old dogs.

Oldy Goldy
When you sitting comfortably for hours till you move slightly and can’t find that same exact position now your uncomfortable.
What a good boyyyy trying his heckin hardest
Mission log, day 17

The docking procedure failed entirely. We'd gone over this so many times in the simulations that I could do it with my eyes clothes, but when we arrived at the station I managed to crash into the mating interface, letting a third of our air supply out before we could close off the damaged module.

Not having planned for this contingency we now can't dock, and we don't have enough air to make the return trip. After a heated discussion about what to do next, we decided to change our course to head directly into the sun tomorrow, which seems better than suffocation. At least we'll die knowing that we were a good boy, yes we were.
That little nod at the end like “yeah this is right”
What a sweet baby!
Older boof's are the cutest boofs
Virginity is cool, remain pure!
Que linkin park

Linkin park?!

He a little confused but he got the spirit.
Good pup!
Aww he almost had it
It wants you to scratch its chin.
Tbh he looks most happiest dog on earth
My dog does that trick. I ask him for paw but he doesn’t want to. I ask him for face and get puppy face in my hand. We don’t deserve dogs they’re so pure
i love him
I've walked around the block a few times and pissed on many a fire hydrant in my day, boy. I know your trick, and will now wag my tail while drooling on your hands to make my revenge look cute.
He nailed it!

Watching this just saddens me to know that there are the sickest of fucks out there who maltreat these adorable creatures.
Good doggie!!
Why am I singing In the End by Linkin Park, only with "in the end, result was even cuter" instead of the original lyrics for the last 30 minutes inside of my head?
My heart is melting
Let's be honest, he didn't try that hard
Oh hey hooman. Woah what hek? I'm not putting my snoot in that.
Why are you trying to Mind Control your dog?
Sugar face puppies are so cute!!!
