Aww is  she blind?* edited
What a venerable lady... I can see she's mostly going on hearing and smell these days, but overall she looks great!

I hope that she enjoys whatever time is given to her.  She has fulfilled the ancient promise  between dog and human in her own special way.
Much happy. So cake.
Such cute

Much birthday

Wow
Oh no, someday we're gonna have another iteration of Gabe the dog
So birthday. Much happy. Very cake. Wow
Very respect. Much good ~~boy~~ girl. Wow.

But actually, mad respect to and appreciation of this doggo. Truly iconic

Such Hap
Such smile so birthday very age wow
Can we please bring this meme back? 

Many laugh. Such doge. Wow.
Kabosu- do you know how many people have made/lost money because of you?!
One thing which isn't intended as a nitpick but a cute bit of bonus info:

„Åã„Åº„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì is 'Kabochan' which is probably a play on „Åã„Åº„Å°„ÇÉ/Kabocha which is the japanese word for Pumpkin.

-chan is a suffix usually used for young girls and as an affectionate term for a person or thing, so Kabo-chan.

Dunno, I just thought that was a cute touch.
When Kabosu passed the internet will crumble
She looks happy and loved.
Aw, poor gal‚Äôs blind ain‚Äôt she? Well she‚Äôs still very lovely. Much cute, such awesome, much borfday.
![gif](giphy|V6vNqIGP1RiMEwmMGV|downsized)
Still got that sense of wonder in the eyes, that "wow" factor, so to speak.
„Åã„Åº„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„ÅØ„Åã„Çè„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„Å≠„Åà
Still as cute as ever.
Wow a true celebrity
Much gorgeous.      

               So birthday.

Damn that makes me feel old
For being 16 years old she still looks very healthy and active (excluded the eyes, does she have something like gray star?)
She has fantastic teeth for a 16-year-old dog
My dog ran away during my wedding yesterday‚Ä¶ please send love
                        so years

Did this dog indirectly make billionaires?
Such old

  
Much cataract
Thanks for the token üò¢
Rare pupper reached rare age with rare eyes
We bow to the sacred beast
Hold up I share a.birthday with the Doge dog?
One of the most influential of their breed. Wonder how many people got shibas just because if her. I know I did
happy bday Kabosu
Kinda makes me sad.....

The life span of dogs is one of the true cruelties of this world.
He better be getting a cut of the crypto!
Happy b day
Kaboose
Buy Shiba Inu!
much love very birthday.  sweet pupper :)    

what a sweet kid!  i hope her days are full of loves and pets :)  and snacks ;p
Isn‚Äôt that like 102 in dog years?
Hopefully she‚Äôll live forever kinda like the queen of England
If I was ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough to invest in DogeCoin, I would have a tattoo of him on my ass right now.
Many birth. So age
Getting on in old age, that dog can't see shit out of those canine cataract. May the rest of your days be filled with treats and belly rubs good pup.
Today we are once again asking the age old question. What da dog doin?

For 16 she actually looks generally healthy. Pretty rare to see in my experience. Happy Birthday, sweet Doge! Much cake!
Just googled average shiba inu lifespan üò¨
love this doggo.   one of my favorite meme's
How did he turn 16 today when he died on March 31 2017
Tenno heika banzai for the doge's life :)
Wow! Sixteen years old is Amazing when it comes to dogs! Congrats to her!
*16 years?!*

I hadn‚Äôt realized how long ago she became a meme, but I am curious how old Kabosu was when she was when it went viral.
The Doge made me a lot fuckin‚Äô money. Also so cute
This is a relief I remember hearing a while ago that she died
Shouldn‚Äôt she be like a billionaire now
GOOD BOy

![gif](giphy|gHKnFHkGPUmG4GTzUt)
I bet you can sell this dog for a million dollars to the right buyer
Wait that‚Äôs the original doge?!
Long live Shiba Inu (the dog, not the coin)
The biggest of Awws do you sir
The goodest of good boys
Those eyes are showing his age. What a good boy.
I've seen this dog turn 16 so many times.
Not to break everyone's bubble, but I thought this pup passed away awhile ago?

Idk, maybe I'm mistaken. Either way, cute shib.

What memes?
So nice
Tell him I love him for me. Thanks.

she looks blind
Wouldn't the Romaji for that hiragana be Kahochiyan? I learned some hiragana a long time ago so I may be wrong, but I was confused by how long it is. Clarity would be appreciated for my understanding.
Awe no... He's gotten so old.
Happy birthday Kabosu.. üéÇ ü•≥  I hope you know you're well loved in entire world.
Am I mistaken and it's misspelled? 

It's missing a (su) „Åô? 

so it should be „Åã„Åº**„Åô**„Å°„ÇÉ„ÇìÔºü
Happy Birthday üéâ

Shouldn't it be „Åã„Åº„Åô„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì?

Much surprise lord still live much happy
Need an updated meme, grandma doge.
This is a small Shiba Inu
Happy birthday! Handsome pooch.
Happy birthday Kabosu!

It is a Kabo-chan! Much WOW!
TIL there is an actual dog for the doge

This dog made me rich
WAIT I SHARE A BIRTHDAY WITH KABOSU?

OH, OK :D
I pant the same way when I sense food near my mouth
‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
The characters say kabo chan
very birthday. such 16
Nice
I love you funny yellow dog. Happy birthday.
Goodess puppy
Fun fact: kabosu is a citrus fruit.  If you fly ANA they have kabosu juice, and I always drink it as much as possible when I fly to Japan
Why did this put me in such a good mood
To tha mooooon!
I hope this dog is rich
My cAke day and the doge are the same great. Much wow.
Much happy

Much cake
I‚Äôm so glad she‚Äôs still alive and doing well
such a good doge.

16 is a long time.
Monch
Yay! I share a birthday with a celebrity doge!
Here comes the Kabosu coin
Imagine if your beloved pet became a meme that eventually became a currency with a $35B market cap.
i love you kabosu , hugs .
Happy birthday. But one question: is he blind? Or why do his eyes have that "foggy" color?
If this good doggo got to be so old, then maybe this timeline isn't so bad.
So do the owner get any kind of compensation for using their dog likeness?
Little mostly blind girl! So cute.
Wait this is the doge meme?
No... that's so old. 

Where is the puppy fairy when we need her?
Is it blind?
This dog inspired two currencies collectively worth more than two trillion dollars.

What a world
The legend
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, KABOSU!!!!
PROVE IT!!!
Happy. Birthday cutie
She looks older than the doge meme
Is she blind?
„Åã„Åº„Å°„ÇÉ„Çì„Åå„Çì„Å∞„Å£„Å¶„Äú!
Just Wow
Happy birthday big guy!!!
Gonna be a sad day
I thought he was dead...
And this is why we will be trading in Kabosu Coin
I wonder if she is rich with dogecoin
Bestest dog. Thank you for being a legend.
Love that doge
Wouldn't that be Kabochan? (makes sense since "Kabocha" means pumpkin and it's like you're adding "Chan" to the name).
Doesn't the Japanese read as Kabochan, not Kabosu?
...I am scared to know the answer to this, roughly how long do they live???
Old man today
What a good dOGe
Much cute.
Can he see?
Looks like the good-looking old man is blind in his left eye.
That is old.
Lovely ü•∞

Many aging.  
Very biting.  
Such crypto.  
Wow!
Wow much good boy
Funny thing, cabot in french (prononced exactly like „Åã„Åº in japanese) is slang for dog.
I love this one dog more than I love myself
Blessed with long life by the power of meme
I know the face of a dog with cataracts all too well. I hope Kabosu has a great birthday regardless :) looks like their owner loves her very much!
Damn i hope that mofo lives longer
He's the OG: Original doGe.
Is he blind?
Omfg he is 16 wow I feel old
Is it just me or does he look like he's blind?
If it's not a **PIBBIE** than who cares really
Wait I got told like 2 years ago that this legend died
Harden your hearts gang, her time is almost here. üòî
Good doggo
She‚Äôs the bestest good girl!
We would love to see her over at r/OldManDog! Such a historic baby!
Still very cute.
Is that her/him?  All pumped up with the bodacious biceps?
Could likely sell this dog to Elon Musk for a fortune‚Ä¶‚Ä¶just saying
Same age as my brother holy shit
Nothing is sadder than realizing how quickly your dog has aged, and that you‚Äôll likely outlive them by several of their lifetimes.
Plz live furever
He looks like he's doing very well for 16. His teeth all appear to be there and very clean. That's good
Dogs usually live for 10-13 years. She's 16 now. Have faith people :)
Happy Birthday sweety!!
Gonna tell my kids I earned $1,000 on a fake currency based off this dog‚Äôs likeness
Happy birthday doge!
did he go blind?
What a cutie pie, looks like a puppy üåû‚ô•Ô∏è
Such treat. So outside. So goodest.
The japanese says kabochan not kabosu‚Ä¶.weird
Happy birthday, happy birthday, baby 

Oh, I love you so

I had a Shiba in. Great mischievous too smart for its own good loyal dog. Not for beginners at all. Hardest dog  to train ever
Beautiful fluffy doggo :)
Everyone should send doge 1 dogecoin for her birthday because honestly if she doesn‚Äôt die rich then i hate this planet
Adorable.

The legend is immortal
She looks like she's blind, am I correct or?

B.S.! The pup is no older than 2 years old. I can tell by its teeth. Oh I forgot they must be talking about "Dog Years".
Such cute. Baby face!!
The progenitor of a large portion of the internet
Yes happy birthday to your dog üêï beautiful
Wow
Bless her heart. Looks to be in great spirits which you love to see!
I recently came across their nft market. They made millions off the pictures and sold them as nfts
Looking at the Instagram page, Doge has been on some huge adventures.
The stars have aligned perfectly in this pup's case, for the way you pronounce his name means "like a boss" in Romanian
Wow
What a handsome pupper.
She‚Äôs beautiful.

Happy Birthday Kabosu!
Old girl looks great
She's wonderful!
Anyone know how long shiba inu lives
Much sophisticated. Wow
Tofu
This doge deserves to be mummified and preserved for all eternity.
Very cake day
What a great doge ! Superrr cute! I‚Äôve always want a shiba !
happy birthday you icon
A legend returns.
It's not much, but take my free silver, doge.
Glad to see I share the same birthday as doge
Happy birthday!!
Shiba Inus are insane.
Best girl.
Yes
Awww, she's gone blind but that isn't stopping her!
She doesnt even know shes famous
Good girl
Average lifespan of Shiba Inu: 12 to 15 years. 
Kabosu: Age 16

I have beaten the odds.
Who would've thought this dog would start a cryptoasset religion. Jesus.
Our pup‚Äôs birthday is the same day!
Much congratulations very good girl
Doge Coin perfect encapsulates how uncertain and unpredictable the Cryptomarket market is, as it started out as a meme about Bit Coin and is now one of the "big players".
Aww
Happy birthday!!!
Protect this dog at all costs
This... does put a smile on my face
when did she turn blind? at least she still seems happy for an old girl
What a cutie! You can just tell she still has a huge personality.
So google isn‚Äôt giving me a good answer for the doge breed. But is 16 considered pretty long for this breed?
And Shiba Inu Coin
Happy birthday
I feel old now
Happy birthday Kabosu!
Happy Birthday Baby Pup!!! Big Hugs!!
Much coin. So crypto.
Happy birthday good girl
Still super cute!
Kabosu's owner is probably the real Satoshi Nakamoto
This deserves all the upvotes
wow, such old
OG Doge!!!
Doge has foggy-eyes now. Poor guy. At least he has an owner that cares for him.
Is she blind? She's so pretty!
Very birthday. Doge. Wow.
Never forget her contribution to man/DOGe-kind
Dogecoin millionaires should send Doge God gifts lol.
omgggg I think about the Doge meme was too much. bless this majestic Good Girl (Much great, Such excellent, So wow!)
Feel old yet?
Beautiful. My Shiba Koto made it to 22 finished off deaf and blind but always a love bug
Woah, the doge is almost as old as I am. That's pretty darn cool.
Kabo Chan!!
so damn cute
No matter age, still good doge.
Sooo beautiful!
I‚Äôm fairly certain it was Balltze, am I crazy?
Happy Birthday! Still looking cute!
Thought about it, it has to be strange owning one of the most influential dogs in human history. Nevertheless, happy birthday ol‚Äô girl!
Dude, someone's gonna tweet when he passes and the doge stock is gonna skyrocket just as a meme I promise
Talk what ya want im gonna make immortality potion for dogs (in taste and smell of meat obviously)
Oldge
We share the same birthday! But I‚Äôm almost double that good pupper‚Äôs age today!

Love Shibas used to have three. RIP zig grace and Marley!
„Åã„Åº„Åô„Åï„ÇìÔºÅ
Looks great for 16 !
What a sweetheart! So well cared for, her teeth are super clean for a dog that age!
Happy birthday meme lord!
The legend
Wowe

Much birthday, doge
Good doge
This is the face that launched an entire economy
Does anyone remember, at the dawn of doge, a video in which a Japanese woman is talking too her shiba ken and due to her dodgy English instead of saying good dog she was saying good dojji (as in dodge).

It seems to have been lost in time.  I'm not sure if it was kabosu or not but this was just before it all started.  Interestingly o can find no reference to it but when you see some origin of doge it makes no sense and it seems people don't know or don't remember.

Does anyone remember such a video?
Didn't he die?!
Such awww
I need a schnoodle poem! Where is he??
This post needs a feels warning.
They have my respect
 All these years later still so cuuuute!!!
What a beauty
112
Omg anyone refreshing for the like count? Hundreds of upvotes but the second.

Kabo-chan is still a legend

Much wow
Happy birthday Doge !! Thanks for everything !
If this dog doesn‚Äôt outlive the queen of England I‚Äôm learning necromancy, there is no other option.
I love this guy üíñ
i still see her doge face underneath that grey aged fur
Happy Birthday!!
What a good puppy.
One of my favorite things to emerge from the internet is this dog and all the memes associated! üíú
She still fuckin handsome god dammit! 
Feel so bad she's blind now...
In doge we trust
The legend. The original.
Awwww look at that beautifully whitened face. I love seeing greying dogs. They‚Äôre always so precious.
I think it's kinda odd how she became a meme. It was just a regular photo yet for some reason it exploded in popularity.
Why isn‚Äôt it pronounced ‚Äúkabosyun‚Äù given the last 3 hiragana?
Cute
Aw she‚Äôs the same age as my pup ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wacky dog does characteristic thing by celebrating birthday.
Aww, OG Doge! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
SHE LIVES
Dogs are better than people.
Much birthdays. Very happy.
Happy birthday!!!
My dog passed away 3 weeks ago at 16 years. RIP Randy.
My old boy Prior had eyes just like that when he was blind. I still miss that tough little SOB.. 2016 still feels so recent

Oh my goodness, I wish I could give the pupper a massive hug and kiss.

This dog has made me more money than any human.

Happy bday sweet kabosu ‚ù§Ô∏è
Much hustle
There was a story about it dying like a few months ago..

I thought balltze
if this doesn‚Äôt pump Doge, then I don‚Äôt know what will.

Happy Birthday, Doge! 1,000th comment.
Much cute would pet
She is also the new CEO of Dogecoin
Basically, this dog inspired the creation of Doge coin, which would later inspire the creation of Shiba coin. Both combined have a market cap of $70billion+. Crazy to think about... this dog has indirectly created vast amounts of wealth.
My childhood dog was a Shiba Inu before people really knew what they were (90s-00s). I appreciate this dogge for bringing them to the light outside small circles and Japan.

He lived to 14. He was a little stunted from parvo as a puppy so we were happy he was with us so long.
My heart dropped when I read that because I was expecting ‚Äúhas passed away‚Äù or something like that. Glad it‚Äôs just a birthday celebration
Sweet sixteen!
Awww such a good doggo
I was confused when the kana didn't match up with the romanji till I realized it was Kabo-chan.

Can someone explain to me why the hiragana is for kabochan and not the stated Kabosu as the title states. Only took intro to Japanese so i am probably missing something. Thanks
