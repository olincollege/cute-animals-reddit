Bam! "According to TikTokker Annie__M, a tattoo artist who lives in the Ukraine, they are simply happy cats who love each other. She says it‚Äôs ‚Äúpure love‚Äù.

When asked if the cats do this all the time or if it was a random one-off, Annie posted more videos showing the feline BFFs walking together."

This is the 6th time I've seen this in a month. Always a different story as to why. OP is a lieing thief.
The black cat is the reincarnated landlord of the grey cats former roommate. 

Give me karma.
This is reposted every few days with a new creative story
Goodbye karma farmer.
Bullshit. This has been posted multiple times.
Downvote for karma farming
fucking liar
Black cat is paralyzed from the waist down, the grey cat is paralyzed from the waist up. They never leave each other.
Would it be possibly to repost this more?
Tomorrow it will be ‚ÄúBlack cat is black, they never leave each other ü•∫‚Äù
I call dibs next month.
What‚Äôs the real story? Just cats hug-walking?
Awwww, that's just adorable, I love this!

Edit: just found that they're not blind apparently. Why lie about then being blind? This is still cute either way.
Even if it's a repost with a fake story, they are both very beautiful cats :D IT'S LIKE THEY'RE HUGGING AAAAAAA
After all the lies i saw here, I dont believe shit!
Little karma farmer yeeeeeeehaaaaaaw!
This is fake with a misleading title so down vote it to oblivion. stop rewarding fake videos

Well, this is the first time I see it and I love it.
I doubt this very much but still cute.
Nice repost bro  .__.
Repost and not true
My heart can‚Äôt handle this
My oldest cat is blind in one eye I rescued him I think its cruel to lie about such a thing
All the feels!
The black cat is not blind. This video is old.
This has been reported SO MANY TIMES as a crazy repost. It's just two cats. Walking. Fuck.
I hope they are both immortal
Anyone have the original?
And they apparently never leave this sub...
What a wonderful world it would be...
So sweet!!
What are they doing in the snow?
‚ù§Ô∏è
They‚Äôre wearing each other‚Äôs socks!
[Totally fucking cute. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sapeople.com/2021/02/15/watch-happy-cats-walk-together-in-the-snow-original/amp/)

Goodbye. May we never see each other again.
This is equally sad and adorable, I don't know what to do
This is a heart melting experience.

Lies.
Cute tho
Next week on ‚ÄúReddit‚Äù: The black cat was a drug lord until the gray cat showed him theres more money in only fans, now they‚Äôre inseparable‚ô•Ô∏è
Jeezus how many times will this shite be reposted with different headlines every time.
My girlfriend is blind. It has been my life‚Äôs greatest joy having the honor of helping her around. This made me smile.
u/StalinergyV2
Amazing the animals are better Humans to each other then the humans can even dream of being Anymore
Aww I saw this clip without any information I thought they where just cold In the snow
OP is a big fat phoney!
This is older than 56k dialup. It belongs in the repost hall of fame.

It's a cute gif, but where'd you get the idea one cat was blind?
I had a chihuahua who went blind as he got older.  Our cat would do something similar for him, help him make his way through the house.  Makes me cry a little to remember.  Animals as the best.
I really have to laugh now‚Ä¶.here is a great video of two cats hanging out in tandem clearly enjoying each other‚Äôs company but NO. Let‚Äôs punish and judge and make it about stupid human likes & dislikes & karma & points & who did what‚Ä¶because‚Ä¶.?????
Cute!  I don't even care if OP is lying...
Karma Farming.... huh. Sounds like what they do at the CERN!
I've seen it several times before as well. Always with the same caption.
Even if it's a dirty repost, this is cute as fuck
I do wanna know why some people are being down-voted for reacting to this. I've never seen this, so what, if I comment my reaction am I going to just be bombared by people saying I'm not allowed to enjoy it because it's just a repost?
Now that's a true friend.
The cats are not blind, OP just farmed karma and awards big time
Why are people getting downvoted just because they are seeing it for the first time and don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs a repost? Is it because they have some semblance of a life outside of Reddit that you feel the need to downvote?

Downvote away!
That cat has more compassion than a Republican
oh my heart!
My heart. That‚Äôs too cute üòçüòç
This has to be the best, sweetest thing I've seen all year! üòç

If the black cat is blind,  why is it looking around at the end?
*This is wholesome.*

Lmao OP why make shit up, my god the need for karma is pathetic here. This cat is not blind.

Alright, I want to know more about this!

Can I report posts for blatant lies?
r/Bondedpairs
Even if it‚Äôs fake it‚Äôs still adorable
These cats are using what most pros in the feline field call quadruple hearing, that‚Äôs when they put their heads together to double the hearing through the snow to find mice around a mile deep.
So adorable
That is beautiful and really shows how we humans can learn from animals
Lying for karma? Just post the video for karma. You don‚Äôt need to lie too. Pathetic.
Garbage human, lying about someone's elses cat being blind.
Look at all the real money awards on a fake fucking post lmao
Adorable, I love seeing human like behavior in animals.

Jeez what's up with the karma grabbing, click n bait tricks. No good, downvote for misleading folks.
Cute cats, but your story is fake, OP.  Fuck off with your bullshit.
Gosh get a room u 2
Fake and gray. Downvote me and the repost!
70k karma for a repost with a bullshit title

Jesus

This is some lovely shit!
wow, what a nice couple!

Im not even a cat person. But this is really something.
‚ù§Ô∏è
These cats were born conjoined, even after the surgery they stick together. Natures metal man !!!
Gay. What the fuck is wrong with them
OHLY SHIP THIS IS SO WHOLESOME
OP, I hear you are also blind to consciousness to write random stories to gifs you find online.
Even if the original story isn‚Äôt true, this is adorable.
This is so beautiful üòª
These cats had some terrible people tie their tails together after a while they became best of pals, now long after their tails have been separated they still stick together.
that‚Äôs so fucking adorable!!!
How the fuck would you know?
beautiful couple <3

I love how it holds its tail over the black one to guide it as if it‚Äôs arm is around it
I find it somewhat mind boggling how individuals who follow liars, believe falsehoods over truths, and/or choose misinformation over finding the factual data, can appear concerned over the accuracy of the title given to a 7 second post.

That‚Äôs precious.
Shit!  I upvoted and then read the comments.  Go fuck yourself, OP... I was emotionally invested and then find out it's all a freakin' lie??  You better watch your f'ing back, you POS.
Amazing

Take care of them, please
I'm glad they reposted this though because I still never saw it before
Very cute! I've got a blind and deaf cat at home. He is not so fortunate. Sadly, the other cat limits her interactions with him to hitting him in the face.
God bless everyone Jesus loves you and died for you
This might be the sweetest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
Tru bro.
The black cat is the grey cat, they LITERALLY never leave each other.
This is *literally* the cutest thing I've seen in a long time. Thank you.
This is lovely.
Aww...  he has a ‚Äúseeing eye cat.‚Äù
I don‚Äôt like cats but this is very wholesome
Super awwwe!
We as humans have a lot to learn from animals
FUCK these cats
Melted my cold harden heart ü•∞ü•∞

It‚Äôs almost time for bed and this is the second best thing I‚Äôve seen today

But, I do enjoy reseeing it. Hella cute cats.

For everyone calling the OP a liar, please post proof so we can see for ourselves one way or the other. Just saying ‚ÄòThe OP is a filthy, karma stealing liar‚Äô doesn‚Äôt prove anything.
I don‚Äôt like cats but the more I see them like this makes me want to like them
No matter what the story is, this is so pure. They look like they have switched paws, the black one has gray and the gray one has black. Purrrrrfection...

And here i thought redditors were good at downvoting reposts. I don‚Äôt know who tho OP is but that thing has been going around r/aww for months
Well, I am not sure whether the Black cat is really blind or not but they looks so beautiful walking side by side like the two best buddies.
That is beautiful devotion!  Melts my heart!!!üíïüíï

This is possibly the sweetest thing I‚Äôve ever seen but neither of those cats are blind OP just fyi.

Press F to the people who upvoted this and then gave out awards XD
Why would you lie about one of them being blind? They're adorable enough as is. People please don't lie just for validation, you can find what you're looking for without making up fake stories. These cute lovebirds do that just fine without adding anything.
This is the cutest best friend shit EVER!!!
This guy is literally a karma repost farm bot and it's worked so well... It annoys me that they got what they wanted, meaningless Internet points for reposting a video that resurfaces once every 6 months.
That‚Äôs the kind of friendship I want

Ah yes, the cat who looks directly at the other one is blind.
That‚Äôs awesome

This is the most reposted thing I swear
This is precious!!
THIS IS FAKE
One of my two ferrets passed this year. Prince was pushing nine years old, and we miss him very much. The last few months he had a hard time getting around. I think his eyesight was not the best, even for a ferret. Our other ferret, Schmeef, would herd him to the food, water and the litter box when needed (we let them run free for most of the day, only putting them in their cage at night).
*Twist:* this whole time they have been trying to bully each other but are evenly matched.
"no u", "no u"
They even put on each other‚Äôs socks
The way it wraps it‚Äôs tail around the other one is so cute!
I love this!  This makes my day!  True love and companionship!
Black cat is actually my father, the white one is his crippling alcohol addiction. They never leave eachother ü•∫

Bullshit.  Cats aren't that kind of social animal.
I hope one dies lol
I hate cats, but that's so fucking adorable. These are the only 2 cats I will ever love.
Those cats aren't waking around like that because they love each other or because one is blind. There's some reason behind it, but it ain't an emotional one.

I care for my pet as much as anyone, but they are not people, much as some would like to say or think.
Co-dependence is a helluva drug.
