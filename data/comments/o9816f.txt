Bam! "According to TikTokker Annie__M, a tattoo artist who lives in the Ukraine, they are simply happy cats who love each other. She says it’s “pure love”.

When asked if the cats do this all the time or if it was a random one-off, Annie posted more videos showing the feline BFFs walking together."

Edit: Neither of them is blind

This is the 6th time I've seen this in a month. Always a different story as to why. OP is a lieing thief.
The black cat is the reincarnated landlord of the grey cats former roommate. 

Give me karma.
This is reposted every few days with a new creative story
Goodbye karma farmer.
Bullshit. This has been posted multiple times.
Downvote for karma farming
fucking liar
Black cat is paralyzed from the waist down, the grey cat is paralyzed from the waist up. They never leave each other.
Would it be possibly to repost this more?
Tomorrow it will be “Black cat is black, they never leave each other 🥺”
I call dibs next month.
What’s the real story? Just cats hug-walking?
Awwww, that's just adorable, I love this!

Edit: just found that they're not blind apparently. Why lie about then being blind? This is still cute either way.
Even if it's a repost with a fake story, they are both very beautiful cats :D IT'S LIKE THEY'RE HUGGING AAAAAAA
After all the lies i saw here, I dont believe shit!
Little karma farmer yeeeeeeehaaaaaaw!
This is fake with a misleading title so down vote it to oblivion. stop rewarding fake videos

This is the cutest scene. 🥰 They're purrfect together.
I shit french fries through my balls
Well, this is the first time I see it and I love it.
I doubt this very much but still cute.
Nice repost bro  .__.
Repost and not true
My heart can’t handle this
My oldest cat is blind in one eye I rescued him I think its cruel to lie about such a thing
All the feels!
The black cat is not blind. This video is old.
This has been reported SO MANY TIMES as a crazy repost. It's just two cats. Walking. Fuck.
I hope they are both immortal
Anyone have the original?
And they apparently never leave this sub...
What a wonderful world it would be...
So sweet!!
What are they doing in the snow?
❤️
They’re wearing each other’s socks!
[Totally fucking cute. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sapeople.com/2021/02/15/watch-happy-cats-walk-together-in-the-snow-original/amp/)

Goodbye. May we never see each other again.
This is equally sad and adorable, I don't know what to do
This is a heart melting experience.
That’s the sweetest thing ever ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Like ying and yang
So sweet!
This is so sweet!!!
This touches the soul.
It's a guide cat
Damn 🥺
That has to be one of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen!
Lies.
Cute tho
Next week on “Reddit”: The black cat was a drug lord until the gray cat showed him theres more money in only fans, now they’re inseparable♥️
Jeezus how many times will this shite be reposted with different headlines every time.
My girlfriend is blind. It has been my life’s greatest joy having the honor of helping her around. This made me smile.
u/StalinergyV2
Amazing the animals are better Humans to each other then the humans can even dream of being Anymore
Aww I saw this clip without any information I thought they where just cold In the snow
OP is a big fat phoney!
This is older than 56k dialup. It belongs in the repost hall of fame.

It's a cute gif, but where'd you get the idea one cat was blind?
I had a chihuahua who went blind as he got older.  Our cat would do something similar for him, help him make his way through the house.  Makes me cry a little to remember.  Animals as the best.
I really have to laugh now….here is a great video of two cats hanging out in tandem clearly enjoying each other’s company but NO. Let’s punish and judge and make it about stupid human likes & dislikes & karma & points & who did what…because….?????
Cute!  I don't even care if OP is lying...
Karma Farming.... huh. Sounds like what they do at the CERN!
I've seen it several times before as well. Always with the same caption.
Even if it's a dirty repost, this is cute as fuck
I do wanna know why some people are being down-voted for reacting to this. I've never seen this, so what, if I comment my reaction am I going to just be bombared by people saying I'm not allowed to enjoy it because it's just a repost?
Now that's a true friend.
The cats are not blind, OP just farmed karma and awards big time
Why are people getting downvoted just because they are seeing it for the first time and don’t realize it’s a repost? Is it because they have some semblance of a life outside of Reddit that you feel the need to downvote?

Downvote away!
That cat has more compassion than a Republican
oh my heart!
My heart. That’s too cute 😍😍
This has to be the best, sweetest thing I've seen all year! 😍
This is why I love my pets❤️
I'm going to bed now, this needs to be the best thing I see today.
If the black cat is blind,  why is it looking around at the end?
*This is wholesome.*
r/savevideo
He has his own service animal
Lmao OP why make shit up, my god the need for karma is pathetic here. This cat is not blind.
adorable :o
 Best friends!
Alright, I want to know more about this!
Lasting companionship…
If that’s true it’s absolutely heartwarming
[removed]
🥺✨
Can I report posts for blatant lies?
r/Bondedpairs
Even if it’s fake it’s still adorable
These cats are using what most pros in the feline field call quadruple hearing, that’s when they put their heads together to double the hearing through the snow to find mice around a mile deep.
So adorable
That is beautiful and really shows how we humans can learn from animals
Lying for karma? Just post the video for karma. You don’t need to lie too. Pathetic.
Garbage human, lying about someone's elses cat being blind.
Look at all the real money awards on a fake fucking post lmao
Adorable, I love seeing human like behavior in animals.
🥺🥺🥰🥰
Title is such bullshit…as much bullshit as kenny saying shorts are covered
That's beautiful ❤️
Come along, brother!  Let me show you the world.
Amazing
That’s pretty adorable
Jeez what's up with the karma grabbing, click n bait tricks. No good, downvote for misleading folks.
Cute cats, but your story is fake, OP.  Fuck off with your bullshit.
Gosh get a room u 2
Fake and gray. Downvote me and the repost!
70k karma for a repost with a bullshit title

Jesus
Awwww
This is some lovely shit!
wow, what a nice couple!
absolutely beautiful, what an example for humans to follow
Im not even a cat person. But this is really something.
❤️
These cats were born conjoined, even after the surgery they stick together. Natures metal man !!!
Gay. What the fuck is wrong with them
OHLY SHIP THIS IS SO WHOLESOME
OP, I hear you are also blind to consciousness to write random stories to gifs you find online.
Even if the original story isn’t true, this is adorable.
This is so beautiful 😻
These cats had some terrible people tie their tails together after a while they became best of pals, now long after their tails have been separated they still stick together.
that’s so fucking adorable!!!
How the fuck would you know?
beautiful couple <3
Aww 🥰
huuu #goals
#**REPOST**
Blind? Is that why they got their socks mixed up?
AWWWW 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
Cool
Every kitten matters
aww
Z,x
Awe
I love how it holds its tail over the black one to guide it as if it’s arm is around it
I find it somewhat mind boggling how individuals who follow liars, believe falsehoods over truths, and/or choose misinformation over finding the factual data, can appear concerned over the accuracy of the title given to a 7 second post.
I love you , no I love you more 💕
I love them 🥺
r/bondedpairs
I come here everyday and i have never seen this
**tell me why**
on this day when it hit 116 in my town, i miss snow.
Now tell me that animals don't have a higher instinct to share an look out for each other!
That’s precious.
Shit!  I upvoted and then read the comments.  Go fuck yourself, OP... I was emotionally invested and then find out it's all a freakin' lie??  You better watch your f'ing back, you POS.
Amazing
U made my day _ love is love. Compassion will save us.
very heartwarming.
Awww🥰
Repost
Take care of them, please
I'm glad they reposted this though because I still never saw it before
Very cute! I've got a blind and deaf cat at home. He is not so fortunate. Sadly, the other cat limits her interactions with him to hitting him in the face.
God bless everyone Jesus loves you and died for you
This might be the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen.
Tru bro.
The black cat is the grey cat, they LITERALLY never leave each other.
This is *literally* the cutest thing I've seen in a long time. Thank you.
This is lovely.
Aww...  he has a “seeing eye cat.”
I don’t like cats but this is very wholesome
Super awwwe!
We as humans have a lot to learn from animals
FUCK these cats
Melted my cold harden heart 🥰🥰
This is just adorable
It’s almost time for bed and this is the second best thing I’ve seen today
I am screaming at how cute this is 🙀
This reminds me of the book Fire Upon the Deep by Vernor Vinge. One of the best scifi books I’ve ever read.
This is really the cat walk on the ice fashion show🐾🐾
We are one now, Jon.
The black cat reminds me of that cat from the matrix déjà vu
I would 100% watch a documentary on this pair
🥺
O ma go turuuuuuu Love.
Mh
That is too cute!!
Wait until it walks on a ledge
Gotta get me a kitty like that
This is the sweetest thing ♥️
If only humans had the same compassion for their own. These 2 are adorable.
awww
This is why I open Reddit on Monday morning.
I see 2 angels.  Now bring them inside please and that will make 3.  ❤❤❤
It’s official; holding tails is the cat version of holding hands.
Best thing I’ve seen all week
Amazing and so sweet!
So very Cute
100% sure these cats are just glued together, Elmer's glue y'know.
Ying and Yang
I hope to find love like this 😭
r/mademesmile
Funny repost would be 2 drunk cats holding each other up to walk.
I’m crying! Animals are more compassionate than some humans.
Never?
The amounts of times I see this with a different header is hilarious.

But, I do enjoy reseeing it. Hella cute cats.
Source? Cuz this has been reposted so many times
Nice
Someone please make a show about them
Wow! The black cat has a seeing-eye cat! Who knew cats could figure this out!!

Animals are amazing.
My heart….it is exploding, this is the sweetest thing. Thank you for sharing this loveliness.
What a beautiful thing! ❤️❤️❤️

Lạnh quá đi vậy cho nó ấm :v
Put those kitties inside… they don’t want to be cold… poor puddies
I could spend all day watching cat videos on the internet and be happy
facts... when cats cross their tail with another cat like above, means they're bff!
This is just so wholesome 🥺🥺
"You're my eyes."
Beautiful ❤️
WOW
Where do I sign up for this kind of love?
How much you want to bet they are conjoined
Looks like they traded back paws
Animals friendship always makes me jealous.
u/downloadmp4
This is wholesome and you have made my day
For everyone calling the OP a liar, please post proof so we can see for ourselves one way or the other. Just saying ‘The OP is a filthy, karma stealing liar’ doesn’t prove anything.
I don’t like cats but the more I see them like this makes me want to like them
No matter what the story is, this is so pure. They look like they have switched paws, the black one has gray and the gray one has black. Purrrrrfection...
Awww 💕❤️
Well turns out the awarders were jbaited since the cats arent even blind
I've never wanted to adopt a pair of kitten so fast in my life
fuck your title but bless those kitties
The tails! 🥰
To damn cute.
That might be the most wholesome thing I'll see this week
And here i thought redditors were good at downvoting reposts. I don’t know who tho OP is but that thing has been going around r/aww for months
Well, I am not sure whether the Black cat is really blind or not but they looks so beautiful walking side by side like the two best buddies.
That is beautiful devotion!  Melts my heart!!!💕💕
Holy crap this use amazing. I love cats.
Such love..
I have to admit, this is pretty cute.
OMG THAT IS SO SWEEEET
im coming back to this later when I get a free award
So cute 😍
They are trying so hard. But, if you please, they will never be true *Siamese*.
Wow. Amazing. Some humans won’t do that for their elderly parents. 😞
How sweet, it's nice to look like that.
# Awww :3
"hey bro I'll cover your asshole if you cover mine"
No it's not, yes they do.
That is way to adorable! Just about the sweetest thing I've seen in awhile! Wow!
 Wholesome content blessing in the morning. 😍
The cats from Mary and the Witches Flower IRL
Amazing! Cats are awesome
I want to gift you all the coins Reddit has to offer for posting this. Apologies for being poor and not doing that. Thank you will have to do. Sincerely love this
Humans could learn so much from animals♥️
😭😭😭😭my heart just fell out of my bellybutton❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
made me smile.. thank you !
Oh is he?  Is he really?  (Assuming she’s a he or vice versa)
Awwwwww😍😍😍😍❤️
That’s painfully cute
That is a saint in cats fur.
cold
the number of awards is insane
Two lovers entwined pass me by
And heaven knows I'm miserable now
I'm gonna lean up against you, you just lean right back against me.
Technically its missleading
Perfectly in sync
I love how they wrap their tails around each other 🥺
Wow
Tbh I was thinking they were doing this for the warmth.. but the loving each other part is nice too. 🤗
🖤🖤
I’m in love!💜
Such devotion.  Poor little kitty.
Fricken awwwwDorable
Awww😭😭😭
Your not fooling anyone with the blind part. >:(
You should correct your post’s title since it’s wrong…
I love how they have mismatch paws.
They use their tails as arms aweeeee
This is a beautiful thing
That is too cute
I love them.  I love blind kitty and i love blind kitty handler.
This is possibly the sweetest thing I’ve ever seen but neither of those cats are blind OP just fyi.
Block this user if you want to see just a tiny amount less false information/karma farming in your life:)
I like these cat, but take a down vote due to karma farming 🧺
U know it's fake when they use those damn emojis
Blindness questionable, but buddies undoubtedly
I get by with a little help from my friend 💝
Lovely.
that's so damn cute

this cat is blind and i am Bob Saget.

Man this is so wholesome, had a rough day and this made my night . Is someone cutting onions in here sheesh !?
Hmm
Inbox me for hookup
OMG TOO CUTE OMGGGG
This is so cute :D
That's so sweet made my teeth hurt
Press F to the people who upvoted this and then gave out awards XD
Why would you lie about one of them being blind? They're adorable enough as is. People please don't lie just for validation, you can find what you're looking for without making up fake stories. These cute lovebirds do that just fine without adding anything.
This is the cutest best friend shit EVER!!!
This guy is literally a karma repost farm bot and it's worked so well... It annoys me that they got what they wanted, meaningless Internet points for reposting a video that resurfaces once every 6 months.
That’s the kind of friendship I want
No matter what, we can all learn from these two...
HE USED AN EMOJI ON REDDIT AND HAS 90K UPVOTES. ILLEGAL

Wow. We all can learn a lesson in kindness, love and acceptance. They are a treasure.
This is amazing. I love it.
OP is a spammer too
Hey check out those sheep
Even if the blind part is fake I want relationship goals like this
Cannot believe the amount of upvotes for a repost with a fake title...
How many times dude
Mom said it was my turn to repost this.
Cat S O C I E T Y is great
This is one of the most wonderful cat things I've ever seen.

why would you come on the internet to just lie?
How can you not adore these fur babies? 😍
They are not blind actually
I want a love like this so bad… with a human. Me and my cat are madly in love but a real love would be something fantastic.
So adorable 😚😚😚
Shame on you for karmafarming
Lmao the black cat is not blind.
Ok but this is a repost, so the title is lies
Awww holding tails
So sweet and cute!! 😢🥺
Ah yes, the cat who looks directly at the other one is blind.
That’s awesome
Love you
Aww
This is the most reposted thing I swear
This is precious!!
THIS IS FAKE
One of my two ferrets passed this year. Prince was pushing nine years old, and we miss him very much. The last few months he had a hard time getting around. I think his eyesight was not the best, even for a ferret. Our other ferret, Schmeef, would herd him to the food, water and the litter box when needed (we let them run free for most of the day, only putting them in their cage at night).
*Twist:* this whole time they have been trying to bully each other but are evenly matched.
"no u", "no u"
They even put on each other’s socks
The way it wraps it’s tail around the other one is so cute!
I love this!  This makes my day!  True love and companionship!
Black cat is actually my father, the white one is his crippling alcohol addiction. They never leave eachother 🥺
So sweet😍
She's a seeing eye cat!
This is wonderful
So adorable
What the fuck MODs misleading title like a motherfucker
This is some bullshit
I simply love it . We all as humans could learn a thing or two or three.....
Omg love it!
MUH HEART
That's beautiful

I've seen this clip before. Pretty sure they're sticking together to keep each other warm in the snow.
I did my part and downvoted… did you?
So cute ☺️ there is kittens nearby
Pretty adorable in any case!
My heart. That is really cute and nice to see.

Not so nice to lie, Don't see why lie and say one cat is blind.
Awww, that is just adorbs
Never knew cats had the capacity to be this nice. The cat’s I feed in my backyard literally claw each other for scraps
Why fake it
Wow so cute
Cat sucks piegon Better
“Black cats were created to give everyone the opportunity to be owned by a mini-panther.”
This is an older post but does anyone know why cats do this? I've seen other cats do the same thing. Is it just love?
True story is this is the real pushmi-pullyu
[deleted]
Bullshit.  Cats aren't that kind of social animal.
I hope one dies lol
I hate cats, but that's so fucking adorable. These are the only 2 cats I will ever love.
Those cats aren't waking around like that because they love each other or because one is blind. There's some reason behind it, but it ain't an emotional one.

I care for my pet as much as anyone, but they are not people, much as some would like to say or think.
Co-dependence is a helluva drug.
Aww, to cute.
I don’t typically like cats, but this is cute as fu**
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
My heart…
Pretty cool
"Black Lives matter, even for these furry little creatures". Calling it.
Thank for reminding me that I’ll never have this yet cats can
The cat isn’t blind. You would say anything for karma, huh?
