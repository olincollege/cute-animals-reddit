that is a top notch poocher. 10/10
all dogs are angels
>	They‚Äôre all good dogs, Brent!
Pure breed or mixed breed, I just like dogs
Your dog is adorable.

I do have to say that my late dog was a purebred GSD who was set to be euthanized at the pound. So you may still get a purebred if you look hard enough at shelters. My dog was the light of my life, and I miss her so badly.
One does not simply only find 1 type of Doggo cute. All Dogs are cute.
That is not a dog.  That is a Muppet and I cannot be convinced otherwise.
Highly boop-able!
Lovely doggie, looks to innocent and cute! Whats his/her name?
All dogs are special. All of them. He's a cutie.
Very cute. But all dogs are cute precious angels whether they were purebred or not. They didn‚Äôt get the choice so we have to love them all just the same.
Tongue is 'bout big as he is. Good for puppie kisses!
Cute dog but not all purebreds are purchased. I got my Dalmatian from the shelter.
That's a long ass tongue.
Can we just appreciate a dog without trying to put down other ones? Purebreds can be from a shelter, some people pay exorbitant amounts of $ for mixed breeds. The elitist shelter posts are seriously getting old.
Is it possible that most owners just think their dog is cute regardless of origin?
All dogs have value, but adopt when you can. I have always rescued but I opted to buy my service dog as a purebred puppy. It's what worked out best and she's still working after 6 years. But always consider rescue anytime you can, there's just so many babies that need homes. My next pet will definitely be a shelter baby.
/r/gatekeeping
Don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs an either or. Your rescue is adorable, many pure preds are adorable. Why is it a competition? Don‚Äôt be so insecure, be proud of your new companion and let others do what they want.
Purebreeds end up in shelters and rescue too.
So many people dump purebreds at shelters
Photogenic and happy, the perfect pup!
Without a single doubt: that is a cute dog.
My dog was carried off by a seagull. It was pure bread.
My shelter dog happens to be a purebred! Poor baby spent the first 8 years of her life as a puppy mill breeder. So happy she was able to get a second chance.
Your dog is cute without needing to be hating on purebreds
I'm thinking both are cute
very cute dog but definitely not here for the purebred slander! while i bought my dog (he‚Äôs a service dog), there are also purebreds in shelters!!!
Great dog!

Please stop perpetuating this codified class warfare of purebred vs rescue. I see this value judgment all the time.

They are dogs and worthy of love no matter their breed or mix of breeds. They are dogs, not status symbols no matter their breed. One is not better than the other, all of that is a bad human construct.
[deleted]
You just can‚Äôt go wrong with any dog really
My purebred Pembroke Welsh Corgi, a shelter dog herself after a puppy mill raid, wags her little nubby tail and play-bows at your shelter mutt! 

Rescues rock!
Purebreds can be rescued too! Cute dog btw
Why do you have to make this a shelter dog versus purebred dog thing? So weird and unnecessary.
He is a cutie
What a sweetheart!
This makes me so happy!
My Whitey was the only dog to come up to me at the shelter. He stuck his nose through the fence and licked my hand. He was my friend for 13 years. 

I miss him.
Why does it have to be one or the other? No need for this type of tribalism.
Lmao do you actually think the cute, good natured, healthy dog you adopted would be one of the many thousands put down? He would have been adopted by a dozen loving families had you not come along. 

It's hardly a step up from going to a registered breeder or a family with an accidental litter and a snide comment towards those that engage in that practice is hilarious when you actually didn't adopt a dog that was truly in need of someone to love it.

Fuck pet stores and puppy mills though, definitely.
Purebreds are also abandon, they just get picked up by purebred rescues. They still very much need a home
He's a cute dog.  No need to bash purebreds.
/r/gatekeeping much?
Cool post, hating on other people and dogs to feel better about yours
I‚Äôm with you, friend! My doggo is part Yorkie, pitbull, and black lab. She looks like a gremlin, but she‚Äôs my freakin gremlin!!

Edit - [primly the great, as requested! ](https://imgur.com/gallery/WZuygIJ)
The r/gatekeeping is strong with this one.
My rescue had enough separation anxiety to diarrhea everywhere but the steering wheel in my car. I never left her sight..... 


Sure my girl's cute, but gotdamn.
Why can‚Äôt we love all types of doggos
[Did you adopt my dog??](https://imgur.com/pE9Se0I)
I have one, too!! Pound special right here...

https://imgur.com/gallery/OAIpLT2
I've only ever had rescues, but it was always they rescued me. I had one in high school that wouldn't let my dad in the house, unless my mom was in there with me. He even bit my dad on two occasions.
So cute. This dog is unreal. Like a Disney pup
I wish more people would consider shelter dogs when adopting. I don‚Äôt understand people who obsess and insist over pedigree dogs. Puppy mills are already a big problem.
Historically, I and several other people get mass down voted for suggesting people adopt from a shelter, so it warms my heart to see this post do so well.  **Thank you** OP.
We had to buy a dog because every dog that came through the local shelter required a home with no other pets. We already had a cat. Also this post makes no sense as not every dog you can buy privately is going to be a purebred, and if those mix dogs are not purchased they could end up in a shelter.
I found my dude on the streets and even the dna test I did said "mixed breed" couldn't even pick out any!! He's the best though!!! Small and scruffy
Would recieve more likes if your caption wasn‚Äôt so self righteous. Nothing wrong with purebreds, just like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with shelter dogs. Settle down cammy you aren‚Äôt a hero for having a rescue dog . Your caption is tacky.
Not sure why you felt the need to shit on people who own pure breed, but sure the lil pup looks cute. Hopefully his new owner cares more bout him than to show off that he adopted from shelter.
All dogs are cute.  Stop shaming purebreds.  Some people like attributes of different breeds and prefer them due to their lifestyle or temperament.  Just sayin.  Btw adorable pooch.
Thank you for your service?
"please look how generous I am I love adopting pet please look at me and validate my opinions"
He is one cute pup.
How dare people want different things than u.
He reminds me so much of Courage for some reason lol hes cute
What a scruffy little bug. He's so cute! üòä
Ahh the ol‚Äô gotta put others down to lift myself up.
Dogs don't know if they came from a shelter or not. All dogs are the cutest in my book. Cute dog though!

'What breed is your dog?'

'Yes'.
I've had one dog and he was a shelter pup (RIP Tyler.) My next dog will be a shelter dog, but I can't rule out buying a German Shepherd some day.
Any idea what kind he is? He looks just like our rescue and we have no idea what he is.

My pup is from a shelter. I often wonder what she did to end up in a  shelter. What storied past brought her to me.
It‚Äôs a dog who cares if it‚Äôs a pure breed or not their all gonna die one day anyways some shelter dogs are purebred and some non shelter dogs aren‚Äôt purebred it doesn‚Äôt matter
OMG! I‚Äôm in love with that face!

OMG!  How scruffalicious is s/he!
That's a very big smile
Pure breads have to many carbs
Dogs are all amazing. They are just so innocent and smart. I wish all doggos had a home
Not only they are cooler they also get out the best from you
ALL dogs are the cutest. ALL.
EVERY dog is the best, not just shelter ones.
Question from non dog owner. Why do people care about the dog being purebread? Isn't mixing better for the dogs gene pool (less chance of inbreeding, etc)?
that's a cute dog, but no need for gatekeeping. All dogs are amazing and wonderful!
What a gorgeous pup ‚ù§Ô∏è
My favorite dog was a shelter dog! He was the best! RIP to my boy. He ran path marks into the grass when we first got him he was so excited to have a home üòÜ. He heard me crying in the back yard after getting beaten up by my abusive father and leaped the fence (we used to lock him i the front yard during the evening) to come lick my tears and literally cuddle me.  I didn't even know dogs could do that without training. We still wonder how high he could really jump because it seemed we could never build a fence high enough to keep him out or in. He chased his tail for ages üòÜ and loved playing with water but not bathing (weirdo) üòÜ. I went away for a trip and my parents would constantly find him sleeping under my bed. When I came back he did the most graceful leap through the car window and straight into my lap to wag around excitedly. He was friends with random dogs we'd wake up to see him playing with a random dog and when he'd spot us he'd start barking at the dog and chasing it as if he had know idea who that dog was ü§£ don't even get me started on the random cat we saw preening him one morning. I could go on and on. 10/10 would recommend.
Look at that long TONGUE on that cutie. 10/10 deserves treats.
All dogs are cute, purebred or not.
All dogs are the cutest. Let‚Äôs not discriminate.
There‚Äôs purebreds at the shelter. Such weird gatekeeping
Shelter dogs exist because some one was an irresponsible dog owner. All dogs deserve homes, and people should not be judged on how they got their dog if they will take care of it properly. People can have purebred dogs if they want.
So fucking truuuuu #AdoptDontShop
purebreds didn't ask to be born though....
Gus is precious!  Has a tongue big enough for a pup twice his size üòÖ‚ô•Ô∏è
It's Seymour! I like my purebreds but he's a cool little guy!
holy shit weird ass title. why on earth are you so uppity about purebreds? purebreds can be found in shelters too, all dogs are wonderful, come off it.
Downvoting this because op is being a dick about dogs. All dogs are cute. Fuck off with your some dogs are cuter than others bullshit.
Cute dog!  Shit message!
Oh.... I guess I should ignore the purebreeds in the shelter.
Nah they‚Äôre all cute and deserve love
Also, bitzers are healthier. The breeding of specific traits, which are detrimental to health, for the sake of cuteness, is unethical af.
My purebred shelter dog is confused by your statement, but adorable pup!
Our dog is so much of a mutt that the shelter just said  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø when we asked his breed. And he‚Äôs the cutest damn thing I‚Äôve ever seen.

We love you, Spyro.
DOGS ARE DOGS.
All dogs are cute.
I love my purebred westie ‚òπÔ∏è
Strange title - Please don‚Äôt ever get a dog based on its looks or cuteness. 
Each breed, crossbreed or mongrel has very specific needs and requirements. Trainability, exercise requirements, social needs, ability to be left alone, sociability, health needs etc etc.  Do A LOT of research before getting one but please don‚Äôt base it on what the dog looks like
You should definitely look into a seatbelt and harness for your dog when you have him in the car, it's far safer than leaving him loose, especially during a potential crash. He is hella cute, protect him.
So happy :)
That is a lion heart terrier, can see at a glance, you‚Äôre a lucky person .
No one said they weren‚Äôt?
Adorable
I grew up with a dog that was twice the size of and a completely different color than his siblings. Friend called him a golden-cocker-dauchsy-doodle
Got a dna test done on mine.  Mostly chihuahua and pomeranian.  Little bit of poodle and a bit of unknown.
Holy CRAP that's a cute pup!  Congrats!  My boy is a shelter boy, and he's the best.  Eternally grateful.  Treat them well!
I agree, shelter dogs *are* the best. We got ours a few years ago and he‚Äôs the cutest little bean I‚Äôve ever had. 

[Dog Tax](https://imgur.com/gallery/rJ37PhD)
People get mad when you dis their $1000+ puppos. The only thing that really matters here tho, is whether you get a rescue or from a breeder, take care of your dog. If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre a piece of shit.
My dude looks like the scrappy star of a Disney film.
That is one cute mf. Love the little stray long individual hairs just springing out. They make him seem like an old wise dog, but the face makes him look like a cute young pooch!
He's SO cute! I love him. And he's so happy to have a family now, you can see it.
Schnauzer/rat terrier mix two very expensive breeds mixed together to create a ‚Äúdesigner‚Äù breed
Thats a puppy.
Adopted anything is the cutest
I know a good boy when I see one. 

And I see one.
If I ever get a pet, it'll be from a shelter.
All dogs are mixed dogs, dont @ me.
My shelter dog is a purebred bully. Biggest baby I ever met in my life
Right. My mom and stepdad had 3 Staffordshire mixes, all from shelters, and they were the best babies.
Very cute pupper. 

What if I told you I have a purebred rescue.

Came here and sort the thread by controversial for drama, did not disappoint. 

Really sad that even r/aww can have toxic people tho.
There are way too many pups in shelters that need love for me to ever buy a dog from a breeder.
Such a cutie pie! My little boy is also a rescue and he‚Äôs the cutest and sweetest thing I‚Äôve ever had in my life.
Congrats on your little angel!

The highbred vigour of the mutts.  Goes for people too.
Happy little accident.
The only thing more obnoxious than owners who gloat about having a pure breed are owners who gloat about having a mutt.
Omg I'm dead from cuteness please don't turn it off I need more please
Glad to see you went for the optional dog; it'll be good company for that tongue you just adopted.
Nothing like that **"I got Adopted"!**  smile.

Thanks, kind OP, for giving a shelter dog another chance. x
So cute
Well, that‚Äôs a dachshund tongue right there. No question about it. What a cute puppers!
wow you hit the mutt jackpot!
OMGOSH!  So stinking cute and yes shelter dogs are the bestest dogs!

I am such a sucker for scruffy little mutt dogs.
Awesome little guy.
Every üëè dog üëè is üëè the üëè cutest üëè  thats it thats my hot take
only explanation I can think of is that those ears are where that tongue retracts into 

because that tongue won't fit in that head otherwise
Omg she looks like a cartoon!!!
love the Heinz 57 mutts!!  what a cutie!
This one is definitely one of the cutest!
Sure he's cute but not everyones profile fits with a shelter mutt. Purebred are sometimes the only dog some ppl can adopt.
Looks like a smaller version of my dog
Very nice
Aawwwwww! What a cutie! Yes shelter dogs ARE the best!!!
What a great choice. Love this little fella
Aww
Adoption is always the best.
You are correct!  Rescues are the best breed out there!!
I agree 100%
And they know. You saved them. They make the best pets.
You know that shelter dogs could very well be purebreds, right?
What about a purebred... from a shelter üòé
All dogs are equal. 

Except Maltese Poodles and Cocker Spaniels who are the Joffreys of the poochiverse.
looks like a mix between a cavalier king charles spaniel and a terrier quite cute indeed
he looks like a small town homeless alcoholic with a heart of gold
My favorite breed of dog is Shelter.
I hope you named him Seymour after Fry‚Äôs dog. He looks just like him.
There are purebreds in shelters too.....
‚ÄúI have to virtue signal because I lack any other qualities to prove my decency and need to feel morally superior‚Äù
Mutts are also much healthier genetically. The people making the choices for what defines a "purebred dog" are also folks I wouldn't want designing literally anything.
Oh my gosh!! I just love this pup!
Hi little feets are adorable!
If your really a animal person this will be enough to never buy a pure breed ever again : Of the 3 million cats and dogs euthanized in shelters each year, approximately 2.4 million (80%) are healthy and treatable and could have been adopted into new homes
SOURCE : GOOGLE
Straight up, people who buy bred animals when there are ones at shelters being put down are selfish. I will never, ever understand.
Omfg.
Ohhh so cute!! Looks like my dog, Max!
It‚Äôs a real-life Seymour!
Agreed
[looks a bit like our puppy üê∂](https://i.imgur.com/j7knEXn.jpg).  Could be some schnauzer in your pup

On my 3rd rescue, best dogs.
Shelter Pets are the best! Thanks for rescuing üòÄ
100% Stray or Mutt for the win.
Fucking Amen!  Shelter doggos all deserve forever homes.
Wow, far too many people in here butt-hurt about the title. Clearly the message is "Adopt, don't shop" and not fuck your golden retriever in particular, who happened to have two golden retrievers as parents.
Thats a good dog! Rescue mixes are the best!!
They're all good dogs, Brent
He‚Äôs adorable, shelter dogs are the way to go. My dog came from a shelter, no idea what breed he is maybe an entlebaucher, bull terrier, blue tick something, but he‚Äôs the least aggressive, most chill dog I‚Äôve had, with just enough quirks to be fun. He‚Äôs been known to climb trees and sit like a person.
And the most loyal!
Damn straight! Got me a shelter cat last weekend. He's the best!
just cuz they're from the shelter doesn't mean they're not purebred but damn I love the mutley's better than any of them
And mixes/mutts (although I prefer the word ‚Äòmix.‚Äô Has less of a negative connotation) are less likely to exhibit health issues that are unique to a specific breed. Imo it‚Äôs more humane to cross-breed different species
Is it that hard to just enjoy your dog. Please grow up, the judgemental shit doesn't help anybody.
Adopt, don't shop.
Word, dude. 
I don't like the idea of folks breeding the heck out of a dog so they can sell its offspring.
Aren‚Äôt pure preeds just like...inbred
ADOPT DONT SHOP
dumb title, cute dog
What a terrible title.
Ok you can keep your rat
you‚Äôre more proud of yourself for adopting a shelter dog than you care about all dogs fr tho is what it sounds like
All the shelter dogs near me are pitbulls
/r/gatekeeping
No need for these stupid titles. Just post your pic and move on.
Rescues are the best!

Shelter dogs are good but some have health conditions hence why alot ppl don't get dogs from shelters
I genuinely think that rescue animals make the best pets. They are just so full of love and want to be your bff. That look would lead to a terribly spoiled animal in my house.
Would boop, snuggle and give kisses to in a second.
Gotta love gatekeeping dog owners
OMG, that little one is the absolute cutest thing! And he looks like he's just WAITING to get up to some mischief!
They're the best too! Got 2 girls that turned 13 this year from a shelter.
Mutts are always more interesting!
Agreed. And have the most personality. You can truly see how thankful they are when they‚Äôre let out of doggy jail. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I have two rescues. I wish I could have more.
Man, this comment section is a mess. Too many  defensive owners.


Can we just agree the doggo is cute and leave it at that?
Gatekeeping dogs
Mix breeds are THE best. 

They've lower risk of contracting genetical diseases, live longer (partially because of that) and are a treasure to have. Pure breeds, such as pugs, are as lovely as they are deformed, with problems breathing and am array of "prone to-...", Eyes popping out and other horrible after effects) diseases that lead to short life span. 

You wouldn't inbreed within your family, why you would do so dogs?
oh my GOSH ü§©
I‚Äôll definitely keep my purebred ridgeback in leu of that
Y‚Äôall can appreciate any dog without feeling the need to call someone out. You seem insecure. Good virtue signaling
Lol, no ones giving up their purebreds. They‚Äôre called ‚Äúshelter dogs‚Äù for a reason.

Cue the ‚ÄúaD0pT dOnT sH0p‚Äù virtue-signaling...
Agreed! They just want you to take them home and love them.
Every dog I‚Äôve ever had was a mutt, and every dog I‚Äôll ever have will probably be a mutt too (excluding the off chance there‚Äôs an abandoned pure bred that needs a loving home too)
Adorable!!!!!!!!!
[removed]
They're also the most work too.  Which is great if that's what you want and are prepared for.  The emotional baggage and habits created before you pick them up will affect you for sure.  Just something to remember. Maybe not true if they are puppies... but then again if they're abandoned for significant amounts of time when very young it could be worse.  Just know that you might have to deal with it and be sure you're prepared for it.
Cute dog but maybe don‚Äôt shit on other peoples pets.
This is just what I needed to see. I lost my pup four months ago and had a breakdown just now because I missed her so much. Please cherish this pup.
Any dog is a beautiful dog
My purebred *is* a shelter dog.
Looks like a puppy mill's downvoting people.
Must aren't inbred so they typically have better health
Adopt don‚Äôt shop! Even if the breeder treats the animals well, dogs are dying in shelters. I love my shelter pup!
And they are soo happy that someone actually wants rhem.
Your so right they appreciate your love and  kindness more.
The opposite of a purebred is a mutt. Both of them can be shelter dogs.
strong "not all men!!!" vibes from this comment section. 

your pup is adorable!!
My puppy is a purebred GSD and she is the cutest in my eyes ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Very cute dog you have but it can come off unkind to say ‚ÄúY‚Äôall can keep your purebreds. Shelter dogs are the cutest‚Äù to people who do have purebred dogs.
Purebreds are overrated; I love mutts so much. They‚Äôre precious!
Thank you for adopting :-)
I have two purebred dogs, but my mixed one is the one who gets compliments.
Holy shit how cute! How old?
Fur real.
May I interest you in some purebred shelter dogs?
You can like shelter dogs without shitting on purebreds.
They're literally the healthiest dogs.
mutts are great. Sadly in recent years the mutt gene pool has been polluted with pitbull genes. every mutt at my local shelters are 1/2 pitbull it seems like...

#eat my ass
Shelter dogs for the win! I adopted an older (6 at the time) German shepherd/husky mix like 10 years ago, he was the best! Goofiest dog and was my best friend while he was around! His name given to him at the shelter was ‚ÄúBear‚Äù but it was too basic for his personality and since he was always getting into thing but making me laugh I change his name to Zorro! He seemed to like that name! Hahahaha
Yes breeding dogs is not cool. Plenty of shelter dogs that need help
Gatekeeping acceptable locations to purchase dog for maximum cuteness üòÇ
Amen, thank you for adopting!
True my boy was an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù (blessing for us) from our friends and if we didn‚Äôt take him in he would‚Äôve gone to the shelter.
That dude is too cute.  95% of shelter dogs in my area are pit bulls.
Omg what a cutie little man!!!
Can‚Äôt help but smile when you look at that cute little guy üòÄ
Made my day!
I LOVE HIM WHAT IS HIS NAME
Cute
We had that dog, he shits everywhere and attacks children so we shipped him back. Good Luck.
I am all for shelter dogs as long as they are not fucking blood-hungry pitbulls
[can confirm. they‚Äôre the cutest. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/Qe3gD1o)
Rescues are the best! People who buy animals dont realize how mixed dogs tend to have better temperament, fewer health issues and many are extra smart for having to survive alone.
Yes they are.
And also generally healthier. It‚Äôs not always the case but many purebreds tend to have certain genetic health issues due to a relatively shallow gene pool. Again, not all, but you‚Äôd be surprised how many.
[For example.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/although-purebred-dogs-can-be-best-in-show-are-they-worst-in-health/)

Really going against the grain with a shelter animal, def not like that is 100% the preference of reddit lol
All dogs rock. Mixed or pure bred it‚Äôs about how their loved and brought up. This constant battle is stupid. People who rescue say I don‚Äôt want to fuel unethical business as they order Amazon from their iPhone driving away in their new Volkswagen lmao
Much healthier, too. Nature despises purity.

"Pure" breeds are only for those who are into eugenics.
Pure 100% adorable! It‚Äôs nice that you didn‚Äôt have to pay a full month of rent on your companion and saves both your life and theirs. Win win situation

I agree! Our little shelter mutt is a mix of chihuahua, cane corso, and almost everything in between. And she‚Äôs absolutely beautiful!! Shelter dogs 4ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes, mixed are the BEST!!!!! 

And the smartest!
Amen!!

Fav dog: MUTT!
He is adorable
This pup looks like what I Imagine my rescue pup must have looked like as a baby boi! üíú
Cheeky looking little rascal
Cute Lil terrier mix enjoy
One on the eyes look a bit off and white hairs everywhere? Yeah... cute..
That is just the most adorable thing I have ever seen
That tongue, though üíï
Fax they the cutest i got 2
Hardy and adorable
It's going to be a long time before I buy a dog for multiple reasons, mainly because I work to much and, well, I've always had to be the one to accompany all of my family's dogs to the other side. But if I ever do I WILL get one from a shelter

Muts are for the poors

Scruffy mutts are the BEST.
Weird title. Consider not waking up tomorrow.

Rescues are the best! People who buy animals dont realize how mixed dogs tend to have better temperament, fewer health issues and many are extra smart for having to survive alone.
Ya damn right!
The cutest and their love is like no other

What a cutie!
So agree and so love!!!
want :)
Those eyebrows!!
He is adorable
Going to be a knockout with gigundous heart and personality!!
Mutts rule!
I have a dog that looks like an adult version of them. White front, yellow back, white pattern on the head, white fur around the nose, and brown in the head area. I've been trying to figure out what breed my dog is for a while now. When we got her we were told she was a Southern Australian Miniature Border Collie but we couldn't figure out where her brown colors were coming from.
Looks like nothing but love and some zoomies in your life to come, congrats!
My shelter dogs just so happen to be purebreds (both beagles)
What a beautiful boy! So happy cuz he‚Äôs going to his forever home. What‚Äôs his name?
I love my mutt :)
I will never not rescue! Love your doggie!
Oh my goodness! What an adorable little baby ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

95% crossbred,  5% tongue
How dare you! I love my purebred German Shepherd and Rottweiler! 

P.S. My GSD has admittedly cost me a lot in her life at 9 with severe allergies, and is now starting to show signs of hip dysplasia. There is something to be said about purebreds. Let‚Äôs just agree all dogs are the best!
shelter doggos can be purebreds!
Hehe *sorts by controversial*
This sentiment is so toxic. She‚Äôs a cutie though.
Who says a shelter dog can't be purebred?
It's not a competition
point is best made and reaches others best without condescending spin
.IMO
All dogs are cute. They all deserve love.
Shelter mutts also, most of the time, have a better gene pool.
R/imaginarygatekeeping
We have a shelter dog and he seems to behave better than all the other purebreds we know. Nothing wrong with purbreds though.
Are you implying that purebred cannot be shelter dogs? Really? Smh
Purebred doesn't mean *well* bred. A well bred dog will never end up in a shelter.
Best dogs are mutts. After training so many dogs I can say mixed breeds are so fucking awesome. Best of each and all breeds. Get a mutt, people you won't regret it.
Purebreds are the most unhealthy dogs.
Stop being shallow and save animals in the pound. Humans aren't pure bred, why do animals need to be? ALSO 20% of animals in the  shelter are pure bred.
I mean this pup is clearly a cutie patootie, but there are some god awful ugly mixed pups.
Pure bred dogs are genetic mutations created by humans.
Nice rat lol
"Pure breeds" are the farthest thing from pure dogs lmao
I refer to ‚Äúpurebreds‚Äù as inbreds, because that‚Äôs what they are. I love it when people argue with me about too, oh you mean how you know which medical issues your dog will get when it gets older, not if? That‚Äôs horrific.
Rescues arent for everyone, especially for a first dog, but you are an angel for getting one. Good for you and thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
Mutts are the most loyal and loving dogs you can find. Literally.
They are the cutest and almost always the healthiest!
I wish I could upvote this twice
Louder for the people in the back!
Purebred is another way of saying inbred.
Cute aggression!!!!!
Got a lot of contempt for people who brag about their pure bred dogs they bought from a breeder while shelter dogs die every day, if you aLwAyS wAnTeD a golden retriever that‚Äôs great, take care of it and post to your IG but skip the captions like you did something commendable 

Bless up for adopting not shopping üôè

Edit: funny how all these people got angry and defensive because this very inoffensive comment hit a soft spot for them to the point they reply cussing, using slurs and getting temp banned for breaking the tos lmao sorry you feel guilty for being so vain
Purebred is made up anyway. All dog breeds are the result of artificial selection. So that dog is a an adorable purebred something without a name .

A dog breed is a controlled replication of a mutt that we really like. That‚Äôs all it is.
I wish I could upvote this 100 times
Reminds me of The Mask with that big tongue üëÖ
Cute lil rascal! ü§ô
That‚Äôs a cute dog right there.
He looks so cute
That is the best face!
Look at that little BUDDY! He'll be your bff.

Edit: Can someone explain to me why my throwaway comment about liking the dog was down-voted 5 times? Like, literally I just like the dog, think he looks cute, and think he seems like he'd be a great friend. What reddit rule did I break?
He looks like he wants to be your best buddy!
Such a sweet face. I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to pass him up. ü•∞
10 parts tongue 1 part rest of pupper
Look at that adorable face!! üòç I love "scruffy" looking dogs ü•∞
Omgggggg hes adorable
Great looking little dog. I hope he or she grows into the German Shepherd tongue. Our shelter dog, Sherman. We saw his mother look like a Dachshund corgi mix. Still not sure about dad? Either a Chihuahua, coyote or a raccoon we‚Äôre not sure. Great Dog though.
Seriously soooo cute! Totally a cat person but I‚Äôm starting to really want to adopt a dog too... ü§´
I love him!
What a babe
Oh he‚Äôs a happy boi isn‚Äôt he cute ISNT HE CUTE
Oh my heart. Puppy boii with an old man face. The best.
He cute
This is  dog very cute üêï
üòçü•∞üòçü•∞ what a sweety face
Looks like Jack Russel with Beagle mixed in.
Most are far from pure anyway. Cheers to you
Looks like a wirehair daschund to me
Is this Cookie?
Aww my goodness what a cutie , that happy face and furry little feet. You are so,lucky to be loved by this sweet angel.
Ooooh he looks like my shelter mutt !!! So cute !
Mutts are the best. Healthier, too. Had a big beautiful Heinz 57 growing up. People always asked where they could get a dog just like him (he was gorgeous but his personality was amazing). But we never really knew what breeds contributed to make him. The vet always said he was a little bit of everything. He was a big dog, but he lived to be 18. I still have a big picture of him on my wall more than 20 years later.

Edit: wow, people in this sub really hate mutts. Is it the name? Do you feel better if you call them designer breeds?
[removed]
Pure bred is a polite way of saying inbred.
And usually the sweetest
Yep!!!
And the most grateful
My 4 year old cat i got from a shelter. he's a basic medium haired striped tabby named Kirby. Keep your Persians, Manxs, and Maine Coons.
I like kittehs

But puppos are awesome too!
You ain‚Äôt lying! üòÅ quote Silver Bullet
When you know you didn't fuel an unethical overbreeding business but instead helped a poor soul out, it makes owning a pet so much more fulfilling.
You are correct. That's where you get your dog as far as I'm concerned l, unless you know someone who just had puppies
Do that thang bork tho?
What a large tongue you have, my dear!
Fine lookin pup!
So handsome! üíûüëè
Why not both?
Want to know how someone has a shelter dog? They‚Äôll tell you. Why such a douchey title when your puppy doesn‚Äôt need it?

What a cutey, can't get enough of that smile! Bless you and thank you for choosing shelters.
Shelter dogs are the best for sure! Love them! ‚ô•Ô∏è
We always get our dogs from the shelter! They are the best!
Well all purebred dogs are actually highly inbred
I'd go as far as to say that supporting the dog breeding industry rather than getting a rescue is cruel
Especially this one. ü•∞ü•∞üòçüòç
Truth!
100% with the "adopt, don't shop" crowd!
What a shitty title
Like literally ALWAYS!
oh.my.god
Is this one of those cute when a baby, and so ugly they are cute when fully grown? Cool dog.
üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
They will!
Why is it a competition? Also, I don‚Äôt find your dog very cute
Oh, that‚Äôs an *especially* adorable one!
Why did the movie ‚ÄúLady and the Tramp‚Äù come to mind?
one of the cutest dogs ive ever seen. suspect he is mischievous
Holy shit that is a cute fucking pup
That‚Äôs going to be a great friend! Congrats!
THAT is an adorable scruff-monster!
So adorable! Makes me miss my shelter puppy. He was a little Maltese who responded to the name Thor, which was pretty silly but the name grew on me. Rest in Peace Thor!
‚ù§Ô∏è
I wanna boop that nose üò© So, so cute.
Agreed.  Mine's a giant baby, and a cutie too. Rescued from the county pound as a puppy.
Seriously, you're really adorable!
Oh he is going to love you forever!! So happy for you both!
How precious!!!
Yeah they are
ü•∞ü§óü¶¥ü¶¥ü¶¥
What a little cutie ü•∞
beeg tongue
That tongue is too big for his little body!
Well, this one definitely is!! Hello!
I love that dog
Has a tongue bigger than his head! 

All the better to lick you with my dear!
That *is* a purebred. A purebred Cutie Spaniel.
This is the stuff Disney movies are made of!
Damn. That is one cute pup.
You have dirty plans with that tounge, admit it! Maybe some peanut butter containers need to be cleaned?
Amen! They‚Äôre all so unique and adorable!!
That tongue belongs to a lab at the very least. Or most. No offense meant.
Your guy is adorable! Thank you for adopting! Also there plenty of pure bred in shelters. Got a german pointer and a pug from my local one :)
DOOOOOOGGGGYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY,  you better put the seatbelt on the dog m8. >:(
I LOVE scruffy dogs!!!
Dude, ma shelter dog is so adorable!!!
I agree.
That‚Äôs the cutest pup I‚Äôve seen in a long time. May you have many happy years together!
LoL, that tounge definitely belongs to a larger dog. Both my dogs are rescues too.
He is!
Soooo cute!
A bit of Australia Sheppard?
The cutest‚ô•Ô∏è
YES....... ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
12/10 v good happy boy
That tongue to dog ratio is awesome
Awww sweet baby. We rescued ours when she was a tiny 3 year old, she‚Äôs a healthy girl now.
Looks like scruffy from futurama
Is that a Borkie?!
I have a rescue pup myself. Its like they have a way of looking at you...
That tongue tho  üëÖ
Agreed. I got two mutts (doberman lab mix) and (pit mix) according to shelter.
Cute dog!
That's a pure bred cuteapotomus. Very desirable breed, as they are equal parts cute and glorious.
üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Reject purebred, return to shelter
Cute pup. Looks like my first dog, Gus. Part Terrier part Poodle, or as we said a ‚ÄúToodle‚Äù. Great dog.
cute
Thats what I'm saying
What a cute scruffy baby
Aww what a cutie! I can see him in a comic book! üòÑ
What an adaptable little dog! He looks SO happy
Fur sure!
myyyyyyy man
he's adorable
Longue tong on this pup!
Very cool. Has the markings of Swiss dogs - similar to Bernese or Swiss Mt dog etc
Nice
What great little doggo!
Funny enough my shelter dog is a pure bred , but the point is love all dogs especially shelter dogs
This guy has a mischievous face LOL. He has that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to chew all your shoes and eat a hole in your couch ‚Äú look. But what a cute mug. Good luck. Lots of training, love, and treats he should turn out just fine.
100%
Cute!! My wonderful late pup, Beetle, was a purchased purebred from a nice old lady that was certified. He was the most beautiful, loveable and sweet fellow. I don't know when the pain of him being gone will go away. Congratulations on your new family member! Enjoy all of it.
Awww so cute
There are breed types, from shelters, that gets well represented here.
Lookit that scrawnchy pupper! What a cutie!
love love LOVE that puppy smile!!!!
There are wonderful purebreds at shelters too. No need to put them down or overlook them.
He/She is so cute! I want that little creature!
Gimme your dog! He'/She is just too cute
What a cute dog!
TOO true
Absolutely
Looks like an animated dog brought to life.  Good looking pup
A D O R A B L E ! ! !
This little guy would fit in perfectly with my pack of mutts. Love the face.
Damn his tongue is bigger than his face!
Amen
Love that face‚ô•Ô∏è
Well- THAT one is for sure!!
What‚Äôs his name? He is just the cutest ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very cute
Correction, all dogs are the cutest.
I have a reservation dog and a pure bred Aussie. My future dogs will all be rescues. I love your little pup!!! S/he looks part tri Aussie. Snd a wire haired  something. Just adorable. Thank you for giving her a forever home. She clearly loves you already. ‚ù§Ô∏è
In the UK, if you have young kids, or your garden isn‚Äôt big enough, or you work full time (not from home), you can‚Äôt get a rescue dog. I have purebred dogs and I wouldn‚Äôt trade them for the world, but it‚Äôs a shame that adoption is so strict because many would rescue a dog if they wouldn‚Äôt be turned away. Imo all dogs deserve the best life and it‚Äôs not dependent on breed.
Man, am I the only person who got their dog from Craigslist? Like I‚Äôm not even joking too
Truth!!!
Had a dog just like this one that we had to put down a few years ago. Seeing this makes me hope reincarnation is legit. Please take care of this one. Do better than I did...
They look like you slapped together 4 different dogs in the absolute best way possible
Omg.he is actually the cutest. I wanna give him cuddles
Both of our dogs are rescues
I have a rescue pup, and i tell you what, rescue dogs are the most loveable velcro creatures in the world
All dogs are the cutest.
Damn. I‚Äôve never even heard of that breed
Looks like a Seymour to me. Awesome pup :)
This scruffy little monster is my dream bestie
Name him Gene Simmons
WORD. I would call him puddin‚Äô
Presh!
Quite adorable. Shelter dogs rule!
So cute
I have four rescued dogs and one rescued cat. They ARE the best.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Best dog I ever had was a mutt. Weirdest, cutest lookin little guy I ever seen. Fastest I ever seen too. Miss that little guy. Give yours a hug for me, eh?
They're all purebred dog.
That  üëÖ though...
is that like a terrier and Bernese Mountain Dog got busy??
100% correct.....and they‚Äôre healthier too. All dogs are the best.....but I‚Äôve only ever had rescues...
Awww
This guy is adorable!!!! I‚Äôve had good luck with rescues and strays. Sure, they‚Äôve been a little crazy like me but I‚Äôve never had one cost me a fortune in vet bills or anything. Tough little creatures from the school of hard knocks like mama. Enjoy this precious pup!
What a sweetheart!! What a treasure!
When I saw this picture I thought I was seeing a version of my dog üò≥ just different color, mine is mostly black with a little bit of brown, female and a rescue, the shelter told me she is a Shih tzu mixed with Yorkie
100% agreed!
I have two rescues now after two pure breds (one of which was a  pure headache ) and not only are you rescuing a life but they seem to know it and are perfect!
He‚Äôs a cute puppy, lol.  Too cute!
Both my dogs are purebred and I adopted each at 1.5 years old.
This dog is at least 8% toungue.
He looks like mushroom from life is strange 2
