Need to slide her over to keep brushing away the leaves. Such a pretty baby.
You know who's doing well during the pandemic? 

Cats and dogs. 

Owners are home all the time now and probably have never spent as much time with their pets. Lots of treats walks, cuddles, etc. 

And they have no clue what else is going on.

I just realized I wish I was a dog right now.
Why is there no subreddit dedicated to happy squints?
Good dog is making happy leaf angels with the tail.
Is this what heaven looks like
Aww, such a happy tail!

But also, r/petthedamndog.
BEHOLD!!    THE AWW-CLEAN-INATOR
Did you have her do the rest of the driveway or do you now have a conspicuous clean spot?
Does anyone have a link to the happy dog version?
That smile is everything üß°üß°üß°
With a face like that you know this baby is spoiled rotten and totally works her owners and they eat it up. Jus pathetic! :)
PET THE DOG!

Cutest windshield wiper on the market.
I worked for a vet for well over a decade and you're dog is a perfect example of a golden retriever. I never came across one that wasn't friendly & full of " awesomeness ".  Seems like he/ she would also be great at raking up leaves in the fall which is definitely a plus. üëçüê∂

I was told once by a vet that when my cat (and I would assume dogs) squeezes her eyes shut like that when she looks at me that it is sort of a gesture of affection.  Make of that what you will.
