Do all austrailians get a Hurley and a Billabong t-shirt when they graduate school? 
Do Joey's pee and poop in their mother's pouch?

Edit: The answer is yes and the mother cleans it out by licking it. 
It's so cute, and his limbs are too long for his body. That little flop. 

Still not moving to Nature's Hardmode.

I have a friend who runs a rescue and has a wallaby in her care... She keeps an open backpack on the rail of her staircase, that open backpack is the wallaby's favorite spot to be. It's adorable. 
Weird cat you got there.
He might be tiny but he never skips leg days.
Australia does really have the strangest animals.
Adorable!!
Now I wish I could convince a human to just carry me around all day, too! 
Kangaroos are such unique animals... The only way I can think to describe them is that they're like 30% feet and 70% pogo stick. 
Kangaroos are so precious until they get to that size where hey could kick your spine out of place 
So when do you start pushing the roids?/s
His big ol' ears though ugh ♥️
There should a "Million dollar baby" remake with a Kangaroo boxing humans - with no one acknowledging the fact that it's a kangaroo rather than a human. 
[Probably didn't take much practice](https://youtu.be/6P1vf_7DoLA)
Bless it! It's precious! 
Kangaroo father and his little kangaroois.
I suddenly want a pet kangaroo 
>bluntstones and shorts with a Joey jumping into a pouch

Holy Fuck, this is so Australian I'm getting second hand melanoma
That is an excellent name for a joey
Little dude bonked his head on the floor after he hopped in the pouch.
-plop-
alley OOP
him so smol

I will take one please 
Thank you for warming up my morning on this cold af day.
I've never seen something more Australian 
Are these cute lil guys smart or can you train them very well?

Also, are these common pets where OP is from?   Seems a kangaroo would be a crazy amount of work to stay on top of to me........not to mention when they grow up they could kick the shit out of you!
Sometimes I wanna hide from problems this way 😆
Well... I'm going to ask a heartless question...why would people foster joeys? I thought the kangaroo population was borderline out of control in Australia. 

Bring the downvotes i guess ?
Just wait till he starts going to the gym. He'll end up punching you in the face.
When you mix a dog, a deer and a bunny.
What's wrong with the rat's legs?
It's sooo cute! 
his face looks like a mix between a horse and a rabbit, i’ve never witnessed anything so perfect 
But I wanted the basil plant 
I have the sudden urge to nom on its ears. <3
Omg that's precious 
Oh my God that's so cute literally made my morning
Kangaroos have to be one of the coolest animals in existence
Joeys are extremely cute
Marmalade has done more impressive things than jump into a pouch. Kangaroos are fucking hardcore. 
Oh Marmalade, I love you
If that's not cute I don't know what is. 
What a weird rabbit
Me (25y/o M): yo that's so fucking ado.... Dope. That's fucking dope.
Remember Marmalade? [This is him now.](https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/12/10/roger-the-kangaroo-sanctuary-alice-springs-2_custom-e0dfceba6d2665cc8cc0daa5a57eae2bcda46ad8-s800-c85.jpg) Feel old yet?
Hoppo doggo
Yeh I love Marmalade.
That's one funny looking dog
I want to befriend a kangaroo. 
Given the instinct and love of the pouch at a young age...

If you had a pouch large enough and strong enough, would a full grown kangaroo be comfortable using it?
Is the other one called Vegemite?
u/WakingFear
I want to believe that this is Brett Favre taking care of baby kangaroos. 
_Kangaroos of Reddit, what's it like to grow up in an artificial pouch? How has it affected your social skills?_
Marmaleade... best name ever
I miss when my kangaroo was little. She used to be soooo adorable (she still is, just bigger)
If the other Joey's name isn't Marmite then I want to speak to the manager. 
Those ears! Those eyes!
Am i the only one that thinks that a kangaroo looks like if a horse, bunny, and a dog had a baby and it went through a rebellious phase and decided to stand upright and just kinda forgot to go back to walking on all 4s?
Wait a few months and that bitch will knock you the fuck out 
aaw I love T-rex deers! 
If I worked there, I'd walk around with a belt of pouches and turn into Ultra Roo: Mother of Joeys. 
I hear kangaroos are a nuisance. Aggressive, dangerous, and huge. 
The other one feels left out
Pet kangaroos???? I want one!!!
I will never, ever get tired of seeing videos of kangaroo joeys.
cute
So adorable! 😍 My first cat's name was Marmalade. She was a calico.
Something's wrong with his dogs.
repost
They are also good at jumping at moving cars too. Dumbest animals i swear to christ
so cute!!!
This makes me so happy 
Marmaduke 
It looks like a chihuahua mixed with a rabbit, so cute 
Boing! 
Joeys are kinda weird, but they’re also adorable. 
Hello Marmalade
Awwww
Didn't know Brett Farve owned a roo 
I can imagine how it would sound if that man said the word on his shirt.

Real lady
those legs...
how did you get kangaroos?
Pure instinct 

😂😂😁
"Get in the sack you weird leggy gremlin" 
Is this in Australia? Do people really have these baby kangaroos as pets!!
“How you doin?”
Anyone notice he smacked his head on the ground? 
Anyone else bugged out by the one in the background using his tail as a fifth leg?  May be common kangaroo practice but that was just weird to see.
My first thought was: furry mini-Xenomorph! 
Your living room looks like a porn set my guy.
Don’t you mean vegamite?
I WANT A JOEY TOO! 
Protip: You can do this to any wild kangaroo too to catch a pet

[deleted]
Love this
I forgot kangaroos exist
Kangaroos are so cute 😍
I could’ve sworn you said basil plant
Kangaroos are just Masai doggos. 
Bag the other one too! It must feel like it's naked.
I want one. Omg
bookmarking this for when I decide to kidnap kangaroos and smuggle them out of the country
look at those legs :DDDD
Why is marmalade such a perfect kangaroo name
Precious
Wow those eyes!
Good dog
Best job ever! If you can call this a job.
Is kangaroo meat a thing? Just wondering 
His name is Marmalade!
OH MY SORROWS
I really wish kangaroos didn’t choke dogs.
A baby kangaroo being born, narrated by Sir David Attenborough:

https://youtu.be/j1pn38q4P04
I wish somebody would hold a warm pouch like that for me too jump in but im a fatty it would have to be like a nuclear kevlar sack cause im a big gross fatboy
Are kangaroos and deer related?
r/Eyebleach
Wow, someone turned the video rightside up! Great camera editing!
He's cute now but you better watch it in 10 years when he's buff af and sizing you up 
My time has come 
That's pretty Ausie
Marmalade is amazing and I love him.
I’ll take one. Pouch included?
This is my pouch. Weeeee watch me go in. 
what a good boy!!!
Is that Brett Favre?
I wonder what happens when a baby kangaroo isn’t provided a pouch at a sanctuary? What behavior changes occur?
Marmalade
[If you want your own kangaroo, just do this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6P1vf_7DoLA)
How old is Marmalade (luv that name!) & at what age do joeys typically leave the pouch?

I want one
Do these grow up to be the super jacked Broden roos or the cute rodent looking ones?
And then everything changed when the kangooroids attacked.
skinny legend 
The only animal that can successfully pull off a fanny pack.
Dude. His boots tho. 
australian boxing deer

fun fact: kangaroos have a long sharp claw on their feet and can kill you with 1 kick if they try to stab you with it!
How does this have 38k upvotes but no gold
Lil roo
Soooo cute
I can't stress enough how badly I want to hug a kangaroo
So cute lol
The name marmalade works so well in an Australian accent 
It's eyes say aww while it's claws say disembowlment.
How to farm EZ karma

2. Wait 3 weeks

No shame at all, and you fucks keep mass upvoting it every time
So that is what you want then, the marmalade 
Expected a certain orange cat. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.
So cute! <3
r/murdermittens
I would die for marmalade. 
Redbacks or blundstones!?
Whoa 😮 I want one.
He is holding him upside down. Get it, get it 
Because he is Australian
Xddddddddd
Woah, silver?!? Thanks kind stranger!!
Was I the only one who read Mermaid? 
Pwetty kangawooz
More like "somersaults" into his pouch! 13/10
The thumbnails looks like a blue dog being petted.
We can't ignore the fact that his name is Marmalade. That's too cute for this world. 
G’day tall eared outback boy:)
Wtf it's so tiny
they are so cute
Wtf even is a kangaroo?? 
Why are there kangaroo sanctuaries? The us doesn't have deer sanctuaries.
Amazing core strength to be able to flip over like that on a dime. 
Vertical deer
I've never wanted a Kangaroo so much in my life!  Cute little bugger!
When it was crawling on the floor and it had its feet and arms on the floor the arms also looked very long and it looked like some scary ass sci fi monster and I barely survived the trauma god damn 
ELI5 - why do deer and kangaroos look so similar?
Hey I have that exact Hurley shirt!
Marmalade, I like marmalade
Is the other one named Basil Plant?..
Matter o' time before the little bigger kicks you to death for not being able to hold up the sack when he jumps in it
I want a baby kangaroo so I can feed it and nurture it and when someone messes with me I have an actual kangaroo whomst I've bonded with. Yeye bröther.
I want 73
Dog/donkey/rabbit = kangaroo 
I'm glad this was as long as it was. Adorable! 
Looks like Alien
Strange looking dogs
This is the most Australian thing I've ever seen 
Everybody has a baby kangaroo. Yours is pink but mine is blue. 
Marmalade is a cute little stinker 
Kangas and wallabies need to be in a pouch to develop properly. They need to sleep in this kind of thing or they get effed up spines
Such a cute name for an animal
This is just adorable. 
where do i get one
Definitely adorable and heartwarming.. and maybe it's just me, but that's sadness in his eyes. Poor little thing, I'm so glad and I admire and respect people that get involved in wildlife sanctuaries or with helping animals in general, be it baby kangaroos or the local cat/dog shelter. 

&#x200B;
They are really nice. With some onions and potatoes.... MMMMM. Love them.
Can you just HAVE ONE OR MORE? Cause here in the states, they have "wild animal laws".  PS. they are freaking adorable!
If u don't pick up the otherone too right now, I swear to god...
Serious question: If you had a kangaroo that was fostered this way but all grown up, would they still go into a bag if presented with one big enough? 
Me luvs him
Rats with long legs

Or “diving in” his pouch! 
What kind of dog is this?
Those big eyes

Cool

How cool! Not only is he chilling with kangaroos but he doesn't seem to under the tyranny of miserable woman. Good for you buddy. 
Look at the size of that Australian rodent!
good job Marmalade you're doing amazing sweetie
I just realized my dog thinks he’s a kangaroo.
SMOL KANGAROO
This made my heart jump for joey! XP
one question though, wtf do they even do with them once they become 6 ft tall and are hella ripped and carry 300 pounds dead lift like its nothing?
https://youtu.be/bL6Cqu0g-QY

Get triggered!
r/anormaldayinaustralia
u/vreddit_bot
Gee, it's almost like they have a natural instinct for doing this. 
Aren’t the pouches placentas? Or are they useful beyond that capacity?
God those leg/feet make me so uncomfortable. They’re so unproportionately big and like all bone
That's a weird looking rabbit
It looks nice and roomy

So Marmalade never gets jammed

*yyyyyyyyyyeeeeeAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHhhhhhhhhhhhh*
Those ears!
Oh my goodness soo cuteeee
*That’s* what a baby kangaroo looks like? I’m not sure I’ve ever seen one out of its pouch before. 
Its like a cross between a dog and a rabbit! Are they friendly? I know the adult ones can eff your ish up. 
Nice
He's so cute
His legs are so long
Omg omg how you must be with these beautiful babies!!!!!
RIP Steve Irwin 
It's sooo cute!!! 
It’s one of the Earths miracles that something so cute will grow into a vicious killer someday.
Are kangaroos nocturnal? Never noticed how big their eyes are
Never realized how much kangaroos look like Xenomorphs. 
My kitten is named Marmalade!
Can't wait until the video evolves into " Joey has become excellent at Kickin everyone in the chest and tearing up people with his murder claws".


The trainer looks like he’s still fine tuning though
Good pouch baby
I need the big context plz
This really made me smile
What makes me happy us that you have 2 baby kangaroos, and 1 of their names is marmalade 
Thanks reddit. Now I need a baby roo.
These are the cutest fucking things ever
That that thing is totally my dog.
Did its head hit the ground?
In 6 years it will drop kick you out your window
Skinny thing...then I look at his bicep....gonna be A BEAST!!
Marmalade. What a name. Perfection. 
Are kangaroos closer to deer or dogs in intelligence?
You could've named him Joey
lil joey.
Brett Farve
So cute! How do the babies instinctively know to sit in the pouch? Fascinating. 
Marmalade? This is the most Australian thing I've seen so far
It looks like one of my stray dogs. 
These animals are so cool and interesting!
Ok this is hella cute
Gosh this is cute. Sad it's not with its mother but I hope that's for good reason
Omg such big feet!
Those eyes cut right through my cold heart
Aww man , so cute <3
Kangaroos are so funny looking. Like if a velociraptor got reskinned to look like a deer
Why teach them to jump into pouches if they're orphans? They won't need the skill as adults unless its a comfort thing
Marmalade is the cutest fucking thing in the world
Didn't even check the audio, this guy just LOOKS Australian.

Gonna play with audio now to test my guess. 
40 million kangaroos, 4 million Irish. Leave them on an Island to fight. 
Sooo cutie 🥰🦘🦘🦘
On the hardwood Marmalade, do it on the hardwood.
That Roo already has bigger biceps then me :(
Have kangaroos been domesticated?
What an awesome creature.
Ah it reminds me that someone I know told me how she saw a monkey “carrying her little monkey in the bag, you know? The bag they have for their babies...?” 🤦‍♂️
What noise do they make
They have done big eyes!
Marmalade! 💙
thats a cute dog
What sound do kangaroos make?
she hit her head on the ground :(
I love you, Marmalade 
That's a cute Bounce-dog you have there!
Marmalade, I can only hear it with an Australian accent
That thing is super cute..I want one! We’d make a great team!
Is that Flea?
I want to pet a baby kangaroo sooooo bad 
Oh my goodness! So sweet!!! Are these just regular pets in Australia?
Why didnt u pick up the one that was there first? Think about his feelings
I want a pouch 
Good for Marmalade, but his little buddy is just chilling there on the floor... How can we have a video with just one of the joeys and not the other?!
Awwwwwwwwww😍😍😍
Yeah ok, baby kangaroos are "Jumper Pups" from here on out.
One, please. 
I love animals
Ears!!!!!
I want one
r/Absoluteunits
This is fake. Everyone knows kangaroos are either named Joey or Jack, not Marmalade!
Of course it's a fucking Aussie..
I've always loved the baby horsedograbbit

Is the other one named Vegemite?
I watched it Reddit please stop displaying it desperately
Strangest cat I've ever seen
Wait would'nt her name then be edalamram??? 
Damn Australians at it again
You know what really bugs me all the time when I see these kinds of videos? They jump in and hit their head AND no top comments mention this.
Aww look at his little dinkle 😊
Cutest shit ever. I want a roo 
Are these even safe to have as pets?
Damn them some skinny legs
That's not so much hopping in as falling in.
He is just absolutely precious! 😌
I think he hit the head on the floor.
Wait.  Where did you get a kangaroo?  How did you get a kangaroo?  I want a kangaroo too.
I know this is off topic but Can you legally hunt kangaroos?  I’m asking because I accidentally purchased dog food containing Kangaroo. My dog didn’t eat it but I was shocked. It’s sold by Billy and Margot.
So Aussie. baby kangaroos (or wallabies) and hurley
Haha haha so funny and cute. Congrats Marmalade !!!
Marmalade is served.
Imagine if there was a giant that would hold open a big sack and you could leap into it like this little guy? You would be so nice and warm as the giants carried you around, the sack would block out the screams of the people being stomped on.
Everybody's got a baby kangaroo. Yours is pink but mine is blue.
Soooooo Cute!
Somethings wrong with your dog
bruh, what kind of rabbits are those?
It should be the kangaroo that says, “Australia”, but somehow, it’s the boots. 
Immediately looks up how much kangaroos cost
So fucking cute
He's upset because he should be in darkness not shown off for the public.
Marmalade is more of a UK name. Should be called Vegemite.
Who the fuck named him Marmalade? :)
I want a pouch to jump in to.
Cutest thing ever! 
Awwwe little baby 😍 I am Australian and I have never ever gotten over how cute baby Roos are 
Oh, squeal, he's so adorable!

Please tell me the little bugger sleeps with a Paddington stuffy.
It hit it's head on the ground..
Oh sad. But they are loved now:) 
Well that’s the cutest shit ever
Those are the most Australian lookin shoes I’ve ever seen
Why can’t I raise a baby kangaroo 
How can you not be petting his little head? I just don’t get it.
It’s a cow dog!

>kangaroo

Oh
Is this kind of animal legal to take as pet in Germany 
Isn't he just the cutest thing?  And the name, Marmalade, LOVE IT!  😍
Marmalade! 😍
This is squee worthy 
Are they supposed to be this skinny?
I want a joey now speaking as a former joey 
This makes me so happy

Looks like the lil guy hit his head on the ground
Wow! Your dog can stand on two legs
Wow! Your dog can stand on two legs
He just got me :/
Are kangeroos normally that skinny at young ages? 
Why do they say these are rodents?

Reminds me of a deer, why don’t we consider those rodents.
More animal cruelty on my front page... Tearing mother's away from their babies and conditioning them to enjoy these surrogate blankets
AHHHH KILL IT !!! KILL IT WITH FIRE

Think Koalas own the title tho.
I thought this animal looked emaciated.
