That cat could eat you

*if it were so inclined 

**which, as a Maine coon, it is unlikely ever to be
You have a tiny human.
RIP that litterbox
This isn‚Äôt my cat. But [here is another angle of it.](https://imgur.com/a/2IsWy2d)  Now I want one!
What breed is it? Ron Perlman?
I bet it takes dog sized dumps 

Giving that cat hugs must be heavenly

What the hell does that thing eat? Gazelles? Zebras?

That cat looks like it was stolen from some magical forest and grants wishes. I want one.
This cat also [helps out in the kitchen.](https://i.imgur.com/KZuNKgq.jpg)
I‚Äôll trade you my golden retriever for that cat. 

Maybe not, but we could do a week on, week off custody thing. 
I have one called Chester. Amazing cat but are so hard to maintain and it's hard to cook when he can reach everything I am making! 
Is this real
I feel like he probably has a myriad of spells at his disposal. Possibly speaks multiple languages too.
I kinda want to propagate the rampant breeding of Maine coon cats... feel like cats should be closer to this size. Would likely be handy in the post apocalypse. 
Cat box: third garage.
Looks like r/girlswithhugepussies material.
That. Is one big-ass cat...
Maine coons FTW! The build on your cat looks more like a bobcat/lynx than a house cat. Also, he looks regal as all hell in this photo.
That is one majestic kitty.
Falkor, is that you?
I have a couple of chihuahuas that need regulating.

My Norwegian Forest cat is a good dog. Always greets me at the door when I come home from work. Under foot when I‚Äôm preparing food. Watches tv with me on the couch. 
How much would a kitten of this breed cost?
What an absolute unit. I bet a purr sounds like a plane taking off. 
Your horse looks weird
Your cat looks like a forest spirit.
It‚Äôs a Maine Coon! Sweet, doglike and huge. You can sit next to them and put your arm around their shoulders! They are truly a ‚Äúdog‚Äù for cat lovers 
That cat is bad ass - & he knows it.

I have a question for an owner of one of these cats.  Are they ever aggressive towards humans?  It seems like one of them could kill a person pretty easily.  I'm not normally a cat person, but I could see myself owning one of those bad boys.
Maine Coons are big, but I think are some things going on in these photos. Combination of a small human and perspective with the lens or something to make him look bigger than he actually is. 
I would be totally okay with this. ‚ô•

I have a maine coon pretty close to this size who sleeps on top of me every night <3 it is both wonderful and incredibly uncomfortable.
When that kitty knocks something off the table, it STAYS off the table.

But i would not be surprised if he just had a sweet meow.

He is gigantic! / Or you are tiny.

Jeez. We have a 20 pound British blue Shorthair and we thought he was big, but this cat is humongous.
In my family we always joke that our mainecoon cat acts like a literal dog. She pants, comes when shes called and is uber friendly, lol it's so true
I would ride that thing to battle. 
I have a maine coon. Ye yells, he yowls, he is demanding and belligerent. But he is loving, caring, playful and loyal. He also says "ack" when he is hungry and squeaks like a rusty hinge when he needs a drink.
Never try to ignore a coonie. It hurts. A lot. 
I want one from that litter!
I hope house cat pets continue to get larger.
I need a Maine Coon
My wife and I have just bought a Ragdoll kitten, who sits perfectly in the palm of my hand, and after only a couple of days has bonded with both of us, and our dog.  Just the most affectionate and cuddly kitten ever.   
Cats are crazy when it comes to hunting. My dad owned one that was missing a leg and it still fucked birds up
Totally works. She/he just needs to have a goofier expression and you practically have a goldie.

edit: sfw I promise. 
A coon is still on my bucket list 
TIL it's not mancoon, but Maine coon
This is what I was hoping for when adopting a kitten from the shelter listed as a Maine coon. She ended up just being a Maine coon mix. She's just regular cat sized. 
Is this a Maine coon? This thing is a unit.
Oh lawrd he a comin'
What breed is this. I'd actually consider getting a cat if they were this badass
I find the scale of that cat to be fascinating. The majority of domesticated animals are selectively bred to be smaller and cuter. I wonder if it's possible to selectively breed larger cats that will retain their domesticated traits. Imagine a tiger but with the personality and easy control of a house cat. 
Only? I'll take a cat over a dog any day!
What type of cat is that?? My cat has very similar markings and fur patterns,.and we can't figure it out.

My 19lb Maine coon is like half that size. This is a male which that probably weighs 25lb+. 
Ever since production of Hellboy 3 wrapped he's just been lounging at home.
