That cat has succeeded in completing a goal which every cat I have ever owned has tried and failed at.
I love his mark on his chin. 
Wow! That’s some serious cat skills lol
How did she get up there?
Cats continue to amaze me with the places they manage to get to
That pikachu impression. 
Cats are such weirdos.

What's wire hangers doing in this closet when I told you: no wire hangers EVER?
This is a super cute picture but definitely try and stop her from doing this!

>!If she slips while trying to get up/down from those hangers she could get her neck stuck and suffocate. :(  This happened to my mom's cat when she was young and almost happened to my first cat. since then we do our best to keep them out of closets or at least discourage this behavior. The last thing you want to ever come home to would be that sight. !<
One of my suit jackets suddenly had a bunch of tiny holes on a sleeve.  Turned out to be from one of my mom's kittens finding her way into the closet and climbing up to sleep on top of the clothes.
I'd ask how she got herself in that position, then I remembered she's a cat
He's figured out the most highly efficient method of applying the mandatory catfur to you clothing.
Yet another example of the perfect asshole cat. You want to be mad, but you can't help but laugh at them. My least favorite is when my cats pull clothing off the hangers and it winds up in the bottom of the closet or on a shelf. If I don't find out fast enough, it turns into a little furry cat nest.
This needs to be the new pikachu meme
Hitler found by Soviet soldiers in his underground bunker, April 1945, colorized 
When I first got my cats I wasn't worried about getting cat hair on my clothes so would allow them into the closet. Then one day I walk into my room to see both my cats literally climbing my clothing. They're not allowed in the closet anymore... I have to kick my cats out of my bedroom and shut the door before opening my closet or it just becomes an ordeal. I've known many cats who just hide in the bottom and use the closet as a hiding/quiet space but apparently some cats see closets as a super fun jungle gym. 
Cat: Yeah, I had to back up to get in here, so what?

what a clever, naughty kitty!

If it fits, i sits Level 100
r/mildlyinFURiating
My iguana loves that spot too 😒
Haha. Do you have a door to stop the cat from going into the closet?
I fully giggled out loud at this ridiculous beastie pose! Love it.
His spot makes him look like the surprised pikachu meme
I swear cats always pick the weirdest places to lay down. My one cat, Cash, sometimes picks a new weird spot to be comfy. Recently it’s been a shelf underneath our basement stairs lol
Your kitty has a soul patch. 
Caught and she knows it. 
*"Oh Hi Steve. Which pant would you like today?"*
Imagine sliding open your wardrobe door and seeing this? Especially if you didn’t own a cat?

I just gave up. The fur sticks to everything. I do not care anymore -people of the public! So I love my cats. I feel bad for the computer though.
My cat always did this too. He passed away a few months ago, but I still find this on some of my pants. 
More of her here.  https://imgur.com/a/3cgZVyv
Those types of hangars are pretty flimsy. I’m surprised they didn’t bend 
I really want you to have nicer hangers. Your clothes deserve it.

Also, super cute ‘what, I’m supposed to be here’ kitty,
NO! WIRE! HANGERS!
Part of the appeal of cats, is how they find a use for all the negative spaces. 
Your cats chin mark makes it look like the pikachu meme
His fur makes him look like that pikachu meme 'o' 
I have a dry rack for hanging clothes outside. Everything is always hairy.. I just thought the washer sucked.. turns out my white and orange cat climbs on up and sleeps there.
“Iz not mah fault!”
Its Kitler!
Yeah I came home to my little kitten one day in the closet,  but see your shelf with the sweaters? Yeah, that's where that little stinker was.  So cute too, looking all sleepy like why'd you wake me up??
I would ask how, but cat
She needs a cat tree draped in some of your dirty laundry. 
The paw on the hanger makes kitty look like a trapeze artist!
FORGET EVERYTHING AND FUCKING BOOP THE CAT!! 😍😍😍 
pikachu.jpg
She's shocked that you caught her!

Edit: nvm it's her fur.                          ^(I posted the edit with my comment, I'm a fraud.)
iF i FiTz I sItZ
Cats never cease to amaze me with what they do and what they find comfortable.
"Uhhhh......I can explain"
Old school classic pose or just being a typical cat with no 'F's' given. *-)
The black spot makes your cat look so surprised all the time hahaha
i love how this is the cat-version of the recent pikachu meme
Those are his pants now 
This just seems like more trouble than it’s worth for the cat.
With the chin marking I think we’ve found a better ‘surprised pikachu’ meme
I always check this subreddit in hopes I would see this cat again. I’ve seen every post up until now. I love this cat too much aaaaa
That's a good ass cat. 10/10.
close your closet door?  :-)
Impressive feline. 
Her chin mark makes her look like she's surprised and horrified that you caught her! 

\*"Nooooooooooo the human has discovered my secret shame!!!"\*
So worth it though!
This is the most cat-like thing to do.

She probably has tons of nice sleeping places, but decides to head for the most obscure and difficult to reach spot the house has to offer. Doesn't even look that comfortable.
Me: My pants always have a line of cat fur across the leg...

Cat:
But how does kitty even get in there? Does kitty shimmy? Or is it one fell swoop and kitty is in the right position? I mean the logistics...
Ha, cat looks shocked. Like it was caught with its pants down. 
his face hahahaha
Karen, I specifically recall asking you to wear the black top today.  Why aren't you wearing the black top, Karen?  Karen?
That chin Mark makes it look pleasantly surprised
I thought his mouth was open surprised he was caught 😭🤣
Still, have to admit that cats are artists : how did she arrive here ??

(and that cute face sayin "I do NOT see the purblem human")
Staged
When did hitler come back as a cat?
Close your closet door. Problem solved. 
That's some first class detectiving right tharr.
“Oh, hey!”
How
He looks shocked about it
It's a feature, not a fault! 
I learned the hard way.....  white cat + dark clothes will never mix
That's to funny
I'll be that person just sitting there and be late just to let the cat sit there peacefully 
He definitely looks like he feels guilty.
Omg
Cat
Oh that is an adorable kitty. Looks like the same breed mine are (have no idea what the breed is). They stay kinda little compared to other cats. 
The agility of cats.. you gotta love ‘em...
So funny
Question: how the hell does she get there!
How did the cat get up there ?
How did it get there? 
How does it get in and out of there though? 
What a dork! And I mean that in the nicest way possible! :)
Wtf LMAO😂
How in the world did the Kitty even manage that without knocking stuff off the hangers?
The mark on its chin makes the cat look surprised lol
You can't even be mad, just impressed
Awesome...freaking cats...little evil geniuses constantly coming up with new ways to drive us insane
It looks like you just whipped open the closet door.

"Steve! It's... it's not what you think!"
Everyone, have a wonderful day!
Just look at that innocent face.
Nope
This is why my cats aren’t allowed in my closet. 
So cute! My cat just climbs up my clothes and gets herself stuck on the shelf above my hangers.
slightly r/animalsbeingjerks
I too have a clothing mystery, all my sweaters and long sleeve shirts are getting destroyed on the left side, and only the left side. Scuffed in the middle of the fabric, not the bottom edge. I still can't figure out why.
Me I’m just hanging around 
Cats are so weird. Also, the best.
Careful, Joan Crawford is coming out of the grave to whoop your ass.
how did it get there
i hate cat hair, i wish i could do something with mine
I thought my kittens were the only ones to do this 😂
4 comfy sofa, 3 king sized beds, whole house carpeted, but wherw does she sit?
OMG, wire hangers!
Too funny!
How long did it take you to put all the clues together?
I sit on ALL the laps
Nori is so cute
How ... I don’t even ... how did he get in there?
How...? 🐱💖😂
Cats are so weird.
Sweet kitty. 
I like how shocked she looks that you found her
But.... How did she get in there???
"What....whatd I do?"
*gasp*
Easy fix-Buy new all white pants-Boom no more visible fur line. 
My OCD can't handle all those mismatched hangers. That's all I see in this pic. 
My cat uses the hangers to climb onto the shelf above so I end up with lots of shirts puddled on the floor 
He looks permanently surprised
Do the cucumber thing while she's all up in there. And film it.
Lol, She did it so neatly...
cats are just so weird arent they?  
What an adorable trouserwarmer!
Cute
you took them off the couch and hung them up. Not sure what you expected her to do.  This is clearly on you. 
...she fits, i guess
Yea well...if not for sits then why is hammock? 
I’m pretty sure his face says he’s not talking and he wants a lawyer. 
This belongs on r/animalsbeingjerks
That "Oh, fuck, I'm caught" look
Tbh if that was my cat i be pissed
Makes me glad to have open ended pants hangers. Any cat would just fall right off of those
Because a cat's the only cat who knows where it's at
This position is very comfortable for this cat.
Maybe because you have a cat!
Omg... Mine does the same bizarre thing with my clean laundry, look! https://imgur.com/a/6JT9rf8

Lol
I would very much like to see her process of getting in this position
......how
I came home on a to my cat meowing and found him stuck like this 
Hello there
.
This is tooo much 
Aw, what a cozy and very crafty cutie! 
https://i.imgur.com/jDEEeJ4.jpg
Had an iguana that did this.
Effurciently fluffing the trousers
Lol awesome!
:o
Truly a beauty.
Tears up
"Hang in there, baby."
My cat always waits until I pull my clothes out and lay them on the bed before she decides it's time to jump up and roll all over them. Underwear and my undershirt have to be covering my pants and shirt if I don't want to take a lint roller to them before leaving.
This just confirms cats are magical creatures.
BUSTED😼😹
"Hi! You're home early...."
I see you too have a 4 legged goober in your house.
the spot on her chin reminds me of gary oldman in the 5th element
She looks really cute
Your cat found the perfect indoor hammock!
Comfy af
Where do you even get this type of cardboard ring hanger anymore?

For Kitty's safety tho, you should try to get these hangers instead: https://images.homedepot-static.com/productImages/31caab01-f682-4a6c-8be9-e6baa47855a6/svn/chrome-black-honey-can-do-hangers-hngt01199-64_1000.jpg

They fall sideways so kitty doesn't get caught - we have to do this for our scaredy-yet-clumsy girl who always tried to hide.
Sup Cat.

Just hanging around...
Lol I love cats
Omfg one of mine does this too and it took me FOREVER to work it out !!!

I'd open the wardrobe sliding door and see a shirt on the ground and blame myself for knocking it down while it was that little bitch all along!!!

I only worked it out because the offending cat, Black, has a little nest spot that I thought was her bed BUT she only STARTS the night there... I'd wake up in the middle of the night and not find her so one time I finally searched for her, heard some rustling from the wardrobe, looked in to find her asleep exactly like your cat.

Then it all clicked, and also answered why I had so many loose strings in clothes, she was literally just climbing the clothes on the cost hanger to get there. Smh.

It's a couple of cats nbd https://imgur.com/gallery/luyavwI
How does he get up there?
Repost this to r/lifehacks as an easy way to put wear patterns on your jeans.
his face. so cute <3 so naughty <3

&#x200B;
How?! Lmao! 
This is tew real. 
My cat does this all the time!! Last time she got stuck so I took a video , she won’t be doing that again. 
he's like 😯 you found me!
was it a mystawwry?
I love that anyone that has a cat doesn't bat an eye at this kind of behavior. 
“Well, you caught me.” That look of being caught is so cute 
That's just not possible. Not even for a soul patch hipster cat.
Try being a guy with a black curly haired dog that sheds constantly. I swear they're not pubes!
Aha! Another mystery solved!
"Um. Can I HELP YOU?!"
...how? 
How's the cat even getting up there?!
"Oh hi guys"
We have kitty twins.  https://i.imgur.com/x5PfIky.jpg 
what a comfortable sleeping spot! (Can't really call it a bed)
Always causing trouble.
How does he plan shit like that, much less execute? 
I love how all the commenters are saying your cat looks like Surprised Pikachu and when I showed this to my mom she said it’s a Hitler cat. 
She get stuck there then freak the hell out at 3am?
My cat does this everytime I leave for wirk
Omg I just took a photo of my kitten doing just this!
How.... I dont... physics... cat... idk
BUT HOW?! 
Ha! She's gorgeous. I have a white cat with gray spots that loves to get into my closet. Never seen her in the hangers but she looooves to nap on the  items I fold on top of the dresser I have in there. 
Because...beautiful cat ? :)
the cutest!
I have so many questions
I sometimes take my clothes over to my parent's place to get washed and somehow even after the clothes are washed their cat that likes me the most always manages to lay in my basket of clothes.  She doesn't touch the other baskets, only mine.
Same!
Is your cat Gary Oldman? 
Cats have killed my love for Agatha Christie and whodunit mysteries.  In my house Always the cat did it. Is like Macavity,  the mystery can. 
Well that's adorable.
Can someone please PhotoShop this cats face on surprised pikachu? The mark on its chin looks just like surprised pikachu mouth. 
Not what I expected. Pleasant surprise! 
How did he even manage to get up there I don’t understand cats
How he get in der 
How ...

How?
Little fucker
Human: Please stop climbing into my closet.

Cat: Why?

Human: It might not be comfortable

Cat: thisimage.jpg
The mark on her chin makes it look like she's doing the pikachu meme face haha
How the hell did it get there? Lol
How?
Cat looks surprised it was caught. 
Ladies and gentleman, we got him!
How, how does this even happen??! Weirdo kitty lol
The mark on the chin makes her look like she's like "I swear it's not what it looks like! :O"
It looks like a wierd cat milking machine. 
THAT is a good lookin cat
Why is no one asking how the hell the cat got in this position?
and now we all know... it is Mr Kitty
94,000 up votes, ALMOST makes it worth while. 
It's the "Oh!" Cat!
My cat almost died doing this. She fell and caught her collar and was almost dead when my father in law pulled her out and gave her mouth to mouth. Shes an asshole but always loves on him when he's at the house.

Your cat looks like Hitler
😂, what a cute and weirdo cat. 
My pants always have white fur on the ankle area because my cats hide underneath them in the back of the closet. I know this, yet I often show up to work and look down and am surprised.  I have a sticky roller thing at my desk. 
haha
I love how her eyes suggest it's YOU that's somehow done something strange/impressive. 
Perpetually surprised cat
Ladies and gentlemen... We got him
Lolololol, awesome.
Caught in the act
How could she get in there? :D
He feels as surprised as you, with his chin black hole; looks soooooo surprised you wouldn'tzz believe it.
Your cat is smart af. I just don't understand how they come up with things like this? This doesn't even look that comfy.
Whaaaa? You caught me????
Does that cat have a beard? its so adorable.
Fold your pants, hang your shirts. No hanger line or fold creases again.
I seriously doubt your cat got there by itself 
It's like your cat has its mouth open for all of time
How do you raise a cat to be nice? I’ve always kind of wanted one but I don’t want it to be mean
How tf did he get there 
He's gasping because you caught him.
Yeah this isn't staged.
.
Remov
Hanging pants...

And those wire hangers. 


Wait, people think the cat somehow lodged itself in there and is comfortable? I have a cat who does weird shit but I would bet the lives of everyone I love that this feline was assisted. 

OP, does my family die? 
Liar, liar, chicken fire. 
Honestly this seems like a dangerous habit for your cat.  Cats can become easily Tangled in things while playing and end up accidently getting stuck and strangled.  I had a cat that died because he got stuck in the handles of a plastic bag that I left out when I got home from the market.  Obviously I'm biased, but I would keep the closet closed if I were you.

First of all, who puts their pants on hangers?
