That must make you feel amazing! How lucky you both are to have each other.That is the sweetest thing I've seen today. Thank you.Next time put your hand down just in front of her nose. She will smell you and wake up.This touched ma soul. So precious.Please post more of these and never stop postingWhat kinda doggo is this? Looks like a sweet little lambI always think I’m a whole gangsta until these videos bring on the one solo tear.[deleted]My heart! The way she immediately got up to see you gives me lifeThe way she’s curled up sleeping by the chair leg - I cryI'd drive more carefully everyday just so this pup can lick me in the faceOH MY GOD. Grace us with her name, what a heckin stunning baby 😍That's forking adorable! And she's beautiful!Nub and wiggle butt, is she an Aussie?Totally made my day !Do you use sign language to communicate things like "walk" and "sit"?Ummmmmmm where can I overnight treats? 

1000000% r/aww contentThe cuteness meter is reaching critical levels!Oh my heart.....This is so pure 🥺My sweet old pit girl has gone deaf, and (I'm pretty sure) mostly blind. It's so funny how excited she gets when she suddenly "discovers" you, when you've been there the whole time. My favorite, though, it's when she follows the others' lead and will start baking like mad. She looks so embarrassed when she suddenly realizes the others are gone and she's making a fuss all by herself.She looks like Twig from the show Hilda!Currently working out of state, it’s been over 30 days since I’ve seen my pups, can’t tell you how much I appreciate this!!! That’s one sweet baby!Thank youIsn’t that a Australian Shepherd that was born deaf or blind/sometimes both because the breeding of two Merle’s?the wiggliest marshmallowThis is so cute and made my day so much better, thank you!I’m watching I Am Sam, and then I see this. Idk how much more I can cry.Looks like someone tried to breed two merles.   They usually end up deaf or blind or both.  

 I have a 50lb Aussie Corgi mix that was the product of breeding two merled.  She has a janky eye and a merle patch on her face.  Someone dumped her and luckily a rescue picked her up.Totally worth getting peed on.NiceIll just die of cutnessThat is a keeper. So cute.She's such a lovely girl ❤️My heart melted ..Awww she so cuteIt seems one less sense means more room for loveOH MY GOD SHE's SO WIGGLYSerious question: why is it every time I see a deaf dog they have white fur? I may be oblivious to other circumstances but on the internet it always appears to be some white dog.Oh my gosh, that’s the most precious thing I’ve ever seen. What kind of pupper is she?Aww! I loved seeing this, OP! It is so important that people know not to touch deaf dogs when they are sleeping, since they get sleep startle so easily. (Tapping the floor next to them or turning the light on and off often works too, in case anyone is curious).r/MadeMeSmileThis, this is why I continue existingI tried to adopt a deaf dog earlier this year who looked similar- she wound up going to a home with a deaf family member, so that was a good fit. So adorable!Albino chromosomes in breeding often results in deafness.u/SaveVideowhat a sweet girl!!This is so pure. She is precious Be still my heart!Such a cutie 😍This is the fuzziest most desperate little ball of love I've ever seenOh my god OP please make an Instagram for this pup and reply with the username. I’m in love, and as someone else said, please post more of these and never stop posting.I know when humans lose a sense the other ones supposedly become stronger. If a def dogs nose got even stronger, an you imagine the things it could smell? 

Hey did you smell that? A bee just farted in Maine.Aw she is cute but I feel bad because she’s most likely that way due to irresponsible breeding. That’s probably also why she has white fur and blue eyes. Not blaming you, OP. it’s just unfortunate.He’s little wiggle butt is so cuteOh man that's so adorable.she’s perfect 💘I really love this.. you make that puppy's day!OMGOODNESS 😍🥰What a cute little fluffball!Honestly I'm surprised she can't feel it when you walk in the door. Like by the vibration of the floor.Try making vibrations from the entry so you don't startle it awake. A cane you can tap on the floor, even just a broom handle will do. They'll eventually learn to recognize and associate it with you coming home. It's a gentler way of making them aware of your presence at a distance even when they can't hear, see or smell you.my old girl has finally lost her hearing.  So I get the same thing every day.  I get to lay down next to her on the bed and wake her up gently.  It's my favorite thing every day.Absolutely adorable! I have an 8 year old pit (Annie, my bestest girl) who i rescued two years ago whose heart, soul, and mind are JUST like this but her body is not :(  I'm going to have to put her down this week because of lung cancer, large tumor with more and more restricted breathing.

Seeing this makes me so happy and then sad because her brother and sister both know she wants to and tries to play but just no longer can. She's the sweetest thing you could ever know and has the kindest soul ever. So kind and loving it's not fair, but life isn't. The past two years have been brutal and it turns out SHE rescued me.

I hope your puppy lives 20+ years!Dad your home!The fact this doesn’t have sound upsets me to a level that no human has ever reached.What a sweet little baby!!!!u/savevideoThe love these little creatures give us is truly a giftMy hearttt😫😫🥺🥺🥺So pure 🥰She looks like a tiny little fawn all curled up. 
What a sweethear! <3 Thank you for sharing her, please feel free to share her a bunch more. Or if you have some kind of instagram for her maybe? She's so sweet!This brightened my day👏🏼Literally the best damn thing I have seen all day. 🐶❤️thank you for posting this. had to put down my 15 year old border collie mix a month ago. very hard.

this video reminds me of the good daysHoly heck she's adorableDeaf guy here:

Adorable dog. Clearly loves you. 

Train it to know what flashing lights mean! You show the dog the light switch and make the connection over many times and then when you want it’s attention all you have to do is either stomp ya foot (vibration) or flick the light switch a couple times.The prettiest little eyesLil pee on the kneeIm glad it's innocent excitement, and not excitement with murderous intent.If she had antlers, she reminds me of the deer-fox Twig from Hilda!Just had one of the worst days ever. Seeing this put a smile on my face. What an adorable puppers. Give em some pets for me please.When i see something like this or my dogs in some special moments my fucking will for life just skyrockets. Such innocent creatures. How some people treat them is just sickening to me. I would do prison time for my dogs.She looks like a little fae creature you found while walking in a magic forest. Those eyes are what really sell it.I was house/dog sitting for a family with a deaf and blind boxer (’Ipo). To wake her up in the morning I would leave a treat 6” from her nose and she would freak out with loves and kisses. Whenever I was gone for an extended period of time due to work, ’Ipo would sleep by the wall of the house so she could feel the vibration of the garage door and, again, freak out with loves and kisses.this made me smile so bigSuch beautiful eyes on the good girl! She is soooo adorableMy elderly dog does this also it’s so cuteAustralian Shepherd? She is absolutely precious. ❤️She is so sweet !She's adorableoh my heartOMG I wish this video had sound!!! So cute!!!I love, and want your pup!!! She’s an angelWHY AM I CRYING???Puppy: Are you ready?

Kids: Yes puppy!

Kids: Yes puppy!

Puppy: I can't hear you

Kids: Yes puppy!

Puppy: I can't hear you

Kids: Yes puppy!

...We will never deserve puppershuh?

OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGWow what a cutie 😊💋💋♥️♥️💋💋♥️♥️♥️😘😘 what a cute little fuzz butt."Wait....What? OMG YOUR HOME YOUR HOME YOUR HOME YOUR HOME" Lol I love it.Having lives with a deaf dog, get a vibration collar. It helps to teach them whenever it vibrates- they look at you.   Then you can use hand signals for other commands.Such a cutie, I love how happy she is to see you 😭What I Imagine The Pup Is Thinking: ITS MY HUMAN! ITS MY HUMAN! MY HUMAN IS HOME!Thank you for taking care of her.  She's blessed.  :)when my boy lost his hearing, i used to put my hand in front of him so he would get my scent. i was always afraid touching him might scare him too much. but the way they get so excited for you is just the best ♥️♥️I'm so jealous of dogs ability to fall asleep in 10 seconds, then be in 5th gear in 1.This is the wholesome content that I am here for.this is so sweetThis ❤️I freaking love this sooo muchHaving a dog has improved my quality of life in so many waysI wish there was audio! I want to hear if she squeaks in delight.Aww baby girl!☺️❤️ thank you for sharing this , thats so adorable ❤️☺️Cute. You might find this evolves a little over time. We’ve had several Deaf dogs (and use ASL as our primary language at home anyway) and what always surprised me most was one would always know when I was home even if he was sleeping on a different floor or room. 

Either he has a really good sense of smell or I need to shower more, hahaha. Vibrations and lights tip him off too but any change in smell pulls him right out of a deep sleep more often than not.Her little face!!!She's beautiful!I can’tThis just cured my depressionThat puppy looks like the tiniest little foalThat dog is FUCKING Adorable!Looks like a little lamb lying there curled in a ballOh look at those blue eyes!  What breed(s) is she?Oh, those eyes! 😍😍😍She’s a cutie!that puppy is vibrating with joy.  very niceBy far the cutest thing I have seen todayLove the sweetness. Thx for sharing, and caring.Wow that dog loves you.Ooohhhhhh my!! That’s so precious!! Look at those eyes!!!I need more of this puppy statWhat a great poochie!

She’s gorgeous 💕I watched this 1 million times...Then 1 million more in slo-mo.Wow, that is one cute pup.The littlest piglet!! XDThat was awesome. Thanks for sharing.Give that good puper another pet for me.Aw she looks like a little goat laying thereYou gotta be careful with deaf dogs. You have to train them differently, a stern voice isn't going to mean anything to them. I have a friend with a deaf dog who wasn't trained properly and he's become destructive. He "dug" a hole through the wall of her house.Darn it, who’s cutting onion.She piddled on your jeans! That is true love, I know because my Aussie does it to me lmaoOmg she absolute bebby 😭What an absolute sweetheart ❤️❤️❤️Do deaf dogs bark weird?Aww I lover her! So sweetI love herMy last dog was older and wouldn't hear me come home. She would often wait right in front of the door so you had to open it really slowly so she wouldn't get hurt by it.... Then if she wasn't by the door is have to call her softly or touch her softly so as not to scare her.... The greeting when she realized i was home was what made my day....i miss herWhoa... that look like a snow fox.

So cute.That just made me cryOmg. Is that an Aussie?This is so pureWell done.   So many just end up startled.I wish I could wake up and get moving like that.This is so beautiful, such an innocent and beautiful puppy! 🥺🥺🥺❤️Awwww, she looks like a baby deer when sleeping!!I’m not crying, you are.Real Love.She is cuteAWWWWWWhat a cutie patootie!My 18 year old guy is similar. He sometimes feels the vibration when I walk in and he acts like a teenager! Beautiful little one you have!Such a sweet little faceOmg so cute 😭😭😭Dogs really are special. From sleeping to "OMG I LOVE YOU!!! I MISSED YOU!!!" In 0.1 secondsYou can tell she is greatly loved...This is the best video! How wonderful that you appreciate the gift of seeing your pups excitement. You’ve made my day. Miss mine so much. Keep sharing love the little snow-kissed nose!!What kind of breed is that ?The Lethal White Merle…

The result of breeding two Blue Merle dogs.I never want to not see this ever again.Thanks 4 sharing your beautiful puppy with us. God bless the little thing, & you too.I have a cat who lost her hearing and she's really loud when she notices us.Such a pretty girl.I have a def chihuahua that does the same thing! So adorable.Bro, post more videos of this absolute specimen of a puppy or I will stalk your account like the moon stalks the sun, summer stalks the winter, and dmx stalked crack cocaineMy heart just melted from watching thisAw. Are you going to teach a dog sign language?

Btw deaf here.See? That’s why animals are pretty much better than humans 🥲 that’s just fucking adorableOh my heart. I can't even.Of COURSE this video doesn’t have sound 😂AwewI love herHow do commands work with her? Is it completely gesture based?Honestly thought she was a baby lamb at firstI wish I had that much energy when I wake upNow, that's a good little fluff baby. 🤍  Rub her tummy for me?Oh my. It looks like a fawn. I need a video every day, please.F*ck you, get my upvote!Probably has the bestest sleeps.So cute. I adopted a 12 year old deaf cat. You have to come up with new ways of communicating. For instance, I had to tap or stomp the floor to get her attention. She also was looooud, probably because she was trying to hear herself and still couldn't. Very sweet cat, very scared of cars. She couldn't jump much, so often I let her sit in the garden under flowers, her favourite place to be, and couldn't jump my fences to escape. I miss that cat, cancer got her a year after I adopted her.Her eyes are beautiful! I actually thought she was a lamb when she was lying down for some reasonI’m not crying, you’re crying.i am genuinely about to cry over this purityShe must take peaceful naps since she can’t be woken up by noise.So my morning started well thanks to you.Sweet baby angel 💕Is she home alone when you're not there? I can't imagine how lonely and scary that must be if that's the case..Blowing on their fur will wake them up softer.My deaf and blind Jack Russel would look straight at you when you walked in, almost as if he knew you were there, I’d go over and stroke his head and he’d viciously attack my hand every time.Honesty... I'd die for your dog.u/farmercurtis my heart!!!So cute! If you ever feel the need for it, if you want a more gentle wake up, try blowing on ears/fur or rubbing a paw. Signed a deaf person w a deaf cat. Lol. 

Also, start those hand signals ASAP, it’ll be like your superpower together!Whenever I go visit my parents who have my old lady deaf dog, I put my hand in front of her nose. I love seeing it wiggle as she smells me, wakes up, then the excitement that followsThis is 52nd on the top of all time in just 9 hours holy shitYou made me smile for the first time in ages and I can’t thank you enough. Your puppy is so beautiful and precious- please share a belly rub for being so darn cute!For a moment I wished there was audio, then I figured I should be okay with enjoying it silently, like the puppy.@u/downloadmp4Upvote for karma pleaseWOW! Heart warming, thanks for sharing.Wow, looks so lovelyMy dog lost her hearing almost a yr ago, we used to blow air at her to wake her up but not these days as she sleeps like the dead (gave us a couple of heart attacks sometimes as shaking didnt work, literally “dead” asleep and even a treat right next to her nose doesn’t wake her up ). 

Nowadays we use 3 levels to wake her up : 1) boop her nose, 2) rub her nose and lastly, 3) POKE HER BUTT LIKE KAKASHI DID TO NARUTO. 

That one works the best!

P.S. luckily when she was a pupper, me and dad unconsciously taught her hand signals and we now use that to communicate with her

P.S.S she’s 15/16 this year, still runs around like a bat outta hell 😂Omg I'm in love. Bless you bothI am having a short day and this video is a bibeThis is the best sub now bcos of this videoTail is gone so naturally, the entire body must wiggle to show proper excitement! This is one of the Laws of DogI will never not upvote something like this.Tbh she totally deserves all teh love and attention. Take care :pnot archived yet :)Omg!!!! I want her!!!!!!!!! 😭😭😭😭😭😭Omg!!!! You are so lucky to have this Angel!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🥰Beautiful. Maybe there is something else that can spark her senses? Like a spray of your perfume? Or something to vibrate the floor??  Could help as wellWhen you touched her she was like wait whhhaa  FRIEND FRIEND (*^o^)人(^o^*)Omg that’s so cuteShe's so beautifulI had 2 Boxer/Mastiff mixes, Kaine and Sasha. Kains attention span was a speak of dust in a windstorm, nonexistent. But my Sasha, she was the nurturing type. I used to foster baby kittens for a friend that at the time, was breeding Bengals and Sphinx. Every now and then there would be a kitten that wasn't thriving like it should and I would get those kittens and give them some one on one assistance. Sasha was my helper. She would come every morning when it was "time to feed the baby". She would wait patiently while I would feed them, and she would proceed to clean them up...needless to say, I would need to give a second little clean up because Sasha had the slobber. But it was sweet to watch. She would follow the little kitties around and make sure they didn't get into anything, but if they did, she would get them and bring them to me or if one would get into something she couldn't get it out of, she would come and get me to help them out. She was such a good mommy. I fostered one kitten that was born with a severe skeletal birth defect. We knew that the baby's mortality was going to be extremely short but I took her anyway so she could feel the love and warmth for the short time she would live. Sasha knew this kitten was different and she would be extra gentle with her. Needless to say the little kitten passed away one night peacefully nuzzled next to me while we swept. When Sasha came in the room that morning, she was ready to do her mommy duties and I had to tell her that the baby was gone. That she had died. Sasha laid her big head on the bed, sniffed the little blanket I had wrapped the kitten in and actually cried, which in turn got my waterworks going. Sasha pouted for several days. I took a short break from fostering for a little bit. While I understand the position these kittens are in when I get them, I'm prepared if they don't make it. So, the break was more for Sashas sake. My Kaine and Sasha went over the Rainbow Bridge several years ago and I still miss them dearly. I did get another special needs kitten with the same birth defect that the other kitten had. Only his wasn't as severe, it was very touch and go for the first 6 months of his life but Archer is now 3 years old and thriving and he's my little mischief maker.U/devinmburgess - what kind of dog is this? It’s such a beautiful story I want to share, but I know everyone will ask me haha 😆Thank fully you did not chain her up. I hate people when they do that.Awe!! Thank you for adopting her, I've seen it first hand, special needs pups get passed over and over. Your a great human OP and i hope you have a long and loving life together ❤❤❤I don't think I've ever seen so many awards on a post beforeAwww precious girl, she's so lovely 😍Damn it!!!! How are you going to be the person that makes this hard headed, stubborn and all around a-hole old man get all sensitive and squishy🤦🏼‍♂️. Awe, that is just completely adorable. And her innocent excitement, could not have been worded better nor felt any better either. Thanks for the smile today, it was appreciated.That is magicalThis is just too freaking special. How lucky the owner isPrecious little girl 😍😍
