My cat does the same thing... ... of course, her butthole first makes direct contact with the tip of my nose and ruins it for both of us.

TLDR: impressive precision by this kitten.
Gosh I miss having a cat. Landlord doesn’t allow pets. :’(
Girl wakes up.  Sees baby kitters sleeping in arm.  Realizes this is her life now and will never be able to move again.
Lofi hip hop intensifies 
Looks like you took a break from studying and took a cat nap.
We are so lucky that cats deem us worthy.
I wish I weren’t allergic to cats
Good kitty tucks her butt hole before putting butt in face area.
Ok but that's not a pen, that's an eyeliner lol
The part right when the kitten closes his eyes and is completely satisfied gets me. 
r/eyebleach material right here
This is why I can’t do homework at my house. My cats insists on sitting on my notebooks, in my lap, and consistently rubbing their heads against my laptop.
r/whyweretheyfilming
If you can’t wake ‘em, join ‘em. 
As usual for cats... stick butt in face. That is how I got my name.... was thinking about it..then my boy Ike jumped on the keyboard and stuck his butt in my face like cats do.....hence..... Ikesbutt. Am a 65 year old woman but get taken for a guy all the time because of my name.
That eye close tho 😍😍😍

You can just see the kitty become wholly content once snuggled 😍😍😍
That’s so bloody cute
It takes a lot to make my hardened, cynical, grumpy-ass bastard heart have awwpitations, but that did the trick.

 If only I could get rid of all the people and just have cats and kittens in my life, that would make me very happy. 
Kitten: Wake up Human! You gotta study for the test.
Thinks (If human passes and graduates she's gonna go away to college!)
Kitten:  Let's sleep!
I sits where I fits
Study Purrtner
Late night snuggle partner seems more fitting ❤️
I love the way kitty settles his eyes shut. Like his final moments, because human is now trapped under kitty.
Study buddy
I was expecting cat butt in the nose.
Gods, but I miss those days. Cats are great and I love them but there's something about a kitten cuddling up against you that's just extra to me.
That is the sweetest!!!
Classic kitty cat butthole-in-face maneuver here, too.
Fake, the cat didn't shove it's butthole in the girls face. 
Purrrrrfect 
"Wake up! Your exam is in a few hours and you've fallen asleep! Quick! Pet me now, there are only a few hours left to pet me before your exam!"
Awh so sweet
I remember doing my hw in eyeliner too
This is me and my 80lb doggo
the cat is so sweet😍
I still contend that cats are the best thing in this world. Ugh. They’re so adorable and cuddly. 
The question is, why was this being filmed.
u/wolverine-claws



😍😍😍
Ah yes, the cuddly kiss of death.
r/WhyWereTheyFilming
Goddamn adorable
I want one!
Are there any subs for cats being attached to humans? I'd love to see more like this!
The speed-up makes the cat look like a Japanese horror movie monster.
Time for a little cat nap
That's some deep sleeping, I would be up as soon as the kitten's body heat hits my face
Another one I could watch all day
This kitty is cute. Mine is a demon. 
Why were they filming in the first place I wonder
She's gotta wake up so I can keep listening to some chill lofi beats
Oh my god.. I need new kittens in my life 
This highkey reminded me so much about those Lo-fi 24/7 streams of Relaxing/Sleeping/Studying Beat’s GIFs of some person sleep on some work :,,)
It's like lofi hip hop IRL
Should be in r/perfectfit.
Giving me lofi vibes
I miss my cats
so cute
I sleep on my stomach at night, I have to be careful when I wake up because usually at some point during the night my cat will settle and sleep on my lower back.
Feels like real-life claymation.

Oh holy fuck this is too cute. *LOOK AT HOW HAPPY THE KITTEN IS TO SNUGGLE* aaahhh
That little \*
This video has the same feel as claymation 
Tu 
What a cute creature it is! I love it
Omg this could be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
I'm not kitten you guys, but I can't stop watching this! 
This is so dang cute >___<
This has literally gotta be one of the most reposted gifs on Reddit I've seen it at least a dozen times...
Bengals are the best.
I thought she was getting a kitty butt to the face for sure.
u/thanatos248 this is how I wanna snuggle with you
R/aww should just be changed to r/cats. 
Do cats snuggle like this ?
"Hey! Wake up! Wake up! Calculus exam tomorrow! Wake up!.................okay. zzzzzzzzzzzz"
Bae caught me slippin
Is this the girl from chill 24hr beats?
I wish my cat was as affectionate as yours!!
This is the cutest goddamn thing
god dammit, i need a kitten now
"oh noes, wake up we have calculus... Calculus you fool...we have cal..."
huh, so that's what a cats butthole looks like.
Just as long as the cat don't fart
"But first I must show my bumhole to the camera."
Kitten butthole.  Sorry.  That was distracting.  
I love her.
Marble bengal?
Too cute. I miss having a cat. My dog won’t allow it though
It's not that the cat cares, it's a purely instinctual move to harvest warmth from a large surface area mammel. Cats never care. 
This is not how my experiences with my cat have gone lol
Doesn't look like much studying is going on tho
Omg cutest kitten i have s
I've never seen a kitten be that loving, usually full of piss and vinegar and go fast.  
Omg cutest
Omg cut
Omg cutest kitten i have
Omg
If it was any cat I have ever had it would stick its butt in my face.
The kitty is so tiny!
Best study partner ever also where can I go to get one?
Some study partner
I have to ask, who takes videos of themselves sleeping? 🤔
"Yeah , oh, gonna just squuuuuueeeze right here....mhmm....oh yeaaah"
r/whyweretheyfilming
I record myself sleeping all the time and this never happens! 
kittens = ❤️
Thats so cute! My cat would just smack me in the face and curl up where my warm spot was once I picked up my head lmao
I want it!!!
Study buddy or snuggle buddy? :p
Cute
I love how cats can instantly fall asleep. 
Saw KIKO Milano. This girl wasn't studying, she's practising make up! That's an eyeliner not a pencil
Sweet little baby boy kitteh! 💌
Keanu!
Dat butthole doh
Whatever you do I'm with you!
“Hello? How can I help you? Let me just squeeze in here and ... oof... so cozy. Zzzzzz” 
Kitty butthole
Kitty has a great cinnabon swirl on its side.
Ok human, we sleep here tonight.
the way the kitty just rested its head down and slowly closes its eyes killed me it’s so cute
Things I've learned with pets:

If you leave a pet to go to work or something, the pet will get bored and get into trouble.

If you fall asleep with an unsupervised pet, they'll usually just snuggle with you. Both of my dogs and my buddies kitty have done this.

My dog is still a young puppy, and loves getting into mayhem, but snuggling for a nap is something she understands haha. 
Cutest video ever
Love this 
Where do I sign up for one? =^_^= 

Awwww I wish my dog was still smoll enough to do this
This would make a great cartoon to watch while I listen to lofi chill beats to study to.
The obvious stage makes it less cute. But I still like how comfortable the kitten gets.
Bae caught me slippin
Nice
Nothing is cuter than cats I swear
Omg this is so lovely
So cute

Maybe the fbi spying on us isnt so bad if we keep getting cute cat gifs
This is the type of content that's honestly r/aww 
Now fart!!!
I want a study partner like that!
It's crazy how people vehemently despise cats. 
Fuck this makes me want to get a cat so bad, but i’m allergic 
Cute 
First time this week
love this so much it literally hurts 
Instead of a pen, she has a eye makeup pencil. Just saying. 
I wish I wasn't allergic to cats :(
Don’t think her notes will be that great using that eyeliner...
C A T L O V E R S C L U B
holy fuck im crying this is so precious
Well someone found herself a cozy place to sleep 
This is about cutest thing a pet can do i swear
That's disgustingly cute.
And of course it shows its butthole right to the camera.
My cat still does this, except he weighs 14 pounds and uses my face as a pillow 
Awwwwwww!
Yep Asian checks out 
Anybody else thinks this looks like super realistic claymation?
My cat did this to me but instead of being cute he wrapped himself around my neck like he was putting me in a sleeper hold.
Too cute
u/idiosyncraselyse
Cats are the best, I love their no-fucks given attitude, then real affection when you deserve it.
Super^future!
More like the cutest ever sleeping partner 
I could watch this all day
😍
So I don't like cats. At all. But I really enjoyed this 
"I'm helping"

-Kitten, probably. 
Imma sleep with you human
A-dorable! 
My cat is 14 years old and sleeps on the bed with me like this most nights..

He’s always been really affectionate with me, but I also feel I lucked out on the kitty lottery. 
cats always know their syllabus by heart, cause they're learning from day 1
DAMN LMAO
who was recording this
Recorded by NSA?
What breed is that?
Why is she filming what
"I couldn't do my homework Ms. J."  
  
*Why not? You had all day yesterday after school. Maybe if you stopped playing video games and goofing off-*  
  
Shows video. "This is why."  
  
*Oh. That is acceptable then. Please have it done by tomorrow.*
CATS ARE THE GREATEST CREATURES EVER. 

My god I love cats. 
You ever bury your face into the side of a cat and take a deep breath? Smells so good. 
It was sped up and she still layed her head down so slowly 😻
He loves you😍
Jiggle poots cause demons..
Precious
This is so adorable!!! 😻😻😻
I would not get much studying done with this purrrrrfect snuggle buddy. 
It just melt my heart 💜
Which Lo-Fi hip hop playlist is this?
Okay but that's a makeup pencil. 
I will never understand people with an irrational hatred for gatos. 
My goodness, how it closes its eyes.
I bet that makes studying so much more fun!
If I fits. I sits.
Let’s cuddle and go to sleep
Thank you !!! This just made my day and brought happiness to a sad heart! 
The cutest lil butthole
My little demon does the same thing
This gotta be the most wholesome thing I've seen all day! 
Somebody get that girl a pen! (Don’t know how she’s doing that studying with eyeliner)
Look at my butthole. Look at it. Look.
Kitties are so helpful
this is the cutest thing ever oh my god
r/whyweretheyfilming
They definitely have 'Predator' heat seeking skills 😊
Is it weird that this made me cry?
This was wholesome
Man. I hate it when I’m recording myself studying, fall asleep and then wake up with asshole in my face. 
This is too pure for this world
You're a lucky owner.... beautiful cat!
How cute is that ?
My heart is melting
Awwww so adorable 
This was me during university, my cats saw me studying and boom hello you have to kittens on your lap... Best study partners!
*PAWter
Why does that look like ricegum 
That is just too cute!!
Kitty is doing a good job!
Bae caught me slipping
Aww very cute
I saw this exact post before a week, meaning this is a repost.
If it was any cat I have ever had it would stick its butt in my face.
I am very happy right now thank you
Awwww so adorable 
Cats are just the best
"But first I must show my bumhole to the camera."
Adawable.
