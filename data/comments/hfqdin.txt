The puppy seems pretty happy about it as well.
So sweet - and glad she didn't scream or jump around and scare the pup.  She seems ready for one.  I love the little sniffing nose.
If someone did that to me as a 30 year old dude. There would be a lot of snot and tears.

As sad as it sounds the top of my bucket list is to own a dog one day.
My wife and I were taking bets on if she would cry or not. I think she came close, but the joy overrode the tears. I, however, get misty every time I watch it.

Edit: Wow. Now I know what people mean by ‚Äúthis blew up‚Äù...thanks for all the kind worlds and sharing in our joy. To answer a few frequently asked question:

-The breed is a shorkie (shih tzu/yorkie is mix)

-we named her Cotterpin (after a character from Fraggle Rock)

-we didn‚Äôt buy or go to a breeder. My wife is a teacher and the family of one of her students happened to have a littler and gave the pups away for free. 

-we are well aware of the responsibility and all the hard work that will go into training her and know we are in for a long road ahead of accidents, etc.

-my wife and I are aware that no matter how much she promises to do all the work, we will still be doing the lion‚Äôs share. 

-and trust me, this pup is in her forever home. We aren‚Äôt going to be getting boarded or her, abandoning her or getting rid of her. But I appreciate your concern. It breaks my heart when people don‚Äôt realize the responsibility and the work they signed up for and just drop it like it‚Äôs nothing.

Edit 2: 
-I appreciate those who have expressed concerned over the age and it being away from its mother. A lot of the research we did prior said to wait at least until 8 weeks. There were three other pups in the litter that were all gone at 8, and we asked if it be ok if we waited a bit longer, which actually ended up being 10.5 weeks. We did what we thought was best based on our research.

Edit 3:
-SO MANY awards! All my first! Thank you kind internet strangers!
That first look up at her...what a great memory to capture
Awe this is priceless. Absolutely love her reaction!

Her and the puppy making eye contact for the first time just melts your heart.
I'm 30 and can still remember the day my parents got our family a dog, one to always remember.
Thank you for raising her to be careful and gentle with animals! I was expecting some screaming and jumping like many kids do, but she was so gentle and quiet! It's truly a sweet moment. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Little girl: *high pitched squeal ‚ÄúWe get a puppy?!?!‚Äù

Dad: ‚Äú***YOU*** get a puppy.‚Äù
Oh no the bond has been made ... Rip ever leaving the house without feeling bad. When you leave the door open and look back at the screen and see the sad face ... Was getting the mail even worth it!!!


Cute pup. Looks chill
A lovely memory you can cherish forever! She seems very sweet :)
Yeah, I spent a whole year begging for a dog,... my parents caved and got me     *a cat*.

Best damn cat ever though.
The puppy knows who‚Äôs responsible
My all time favorite videos on the internet are kids getting their first puppies. It's always so innocent and sweet and just makes me feel a little happy too.
*Pup looks up* "... aweeee I got a human??!?"
She‚Äôs always going to remember that moment.  Good one OP, i hope she makes plenty of fun memories with her new friend <3
10 years old is a good age, they're old enough to understand compassion and to be responsible for someone else. Well maybe not all 10 year olds LOL. Congratulations to the whole family!
I spent all day studying for my finals, and dealing with a lot of stress. This made me cry. Thank you for this, it made my day ‚ù§Ô∏è
My grandmother got me a lab puppy for my 10th birthday. I‚Äôll be 25 this year and Lucky is still with me albeit probably not for more than another year. I‚Äôm not looking forward to the day as she has outlived both my grandparents and my mother, but I wouldn‚Äôt trade the time I‚Äôve had for anything. Great gift OP!
Oh she's speechless! Surely it's a very special moment.
OMG when the pup looks up and seems just as enamored with her as she with them! That's just the best. 

It's like you can see the exact moment they fell in love!
My mom did this too my for a kitten earlier this year. I‚Äôm 17 and havnt had a cat since I was little. I got of work around 9pm and got home and she told me to go get something out of the car when I walked up to the door. I opened it to find a scratching post and a bunch of cat toys. My parents got me and my brother a sibling duo. Now there my whole word and I love my kittes to the moon and back
What a good little doggo. Hoping for many happy adventures for them to come!
What type of dog is this?
Is there a subreddit for humans who love animals being surprised by baby animals? It‚Äôs all I want and all that‚Äôs keeping me afloat these days üò≠üò≠
I often cringe at these videos with parents scaring the poor puppy needlessly by locking it in a box and then presenting it to a hysterical child with the poor puppy not having any idea what's going on.

Cudos to these guys for doing it right, the puppy can see what's going on, the girl is calm and the situation is not traumatizing. Just a really cute video!
Just a word of advice (you‚Äôve probably done research already but just case you may not have yet) breeds like this need regular grooming and it‚Äôs always best to get them acclimated to it as soon as possible when they‚Äôre young like this! 

It probably has the soft and fluffy puppy coat right now, but when it grows it‚Äôs adult coat the hair will be finer and can get tangled relatively easily, and if not brushed regularly, the tangles can turn into mats pretty quickly which will then need to be shaved out, and mats can potentially be painful/uncomfortable for the dog since it‚Äôs literally a huge knot in their fur that can pull at their skin. 

Invest in a slicker brush and a fine tooth comb! And reward the pup when it behaves well towards the brushing (since some dogs really don‚Äôt like to be brushed). 

Or you may just prefer to have them trimmed down to a short length coat, but still that would probably involve using clippers which vibrate and make some noise, so you would still want them to be acclaimed to them by the time they really need grooming! 

And also get him/her used to getting their nails clipped!!
How precious!
pets are vital to good mental health
I love that she stayed quiet for the puppy's sake even though she probably wanted to scream
I'll never forget when my dad surprised me with my kitten when I was about 8 years old. That cat lived to be 21 and I miss him everyday!
So precious congrats to your daughter!
The look on the dogs face is oh yeah this is going to be good
Kids need dogs.  Dogs need kids.  It's the law.
Well, what did she name it?
Thank you for posting this! Now I can imagine the looks on my kids face without having the responsibility of getting a puppy!
Man my parents never let us have dogs/pups. It's like I am missing apart of a childhood experience here.
The gift of responsibility. Solid choice.
She‚Äôs so gentle, and so calm with the little pup! Y‚Äôall did a good job raising a respectful little person!
Aww she seems so genuinely happy, heart warming to see such a smile. That puppy will be very loved :)
Got all misty in here...
Adopt don‚Äôt shop
Special place in heaven for animal lovers..
This made my day...thanks!
r/MadeMeSmile
Thanks now I‚Äôm happy
I‚Äôm 32 and I get this excited to see my dog every damn day.
Today i wish someone would give me a dog.
This is possibly the sweetest thing I've seen all day. I too teared up watching this.
That's adorable. I always love how chill pups are when they are introduced to a new owner. This little fella is all like "Yes yes I am pupper. Hello small hooman, I'm here to love you. Let me sniff you a lil bit"
Loved the reaction so adorable
Just look at the way she's holding the doggo ü•∫üò≠
Lost my dog a few days ago, I'm glad to see that more people will experience the happiness of having one and having a good friend
And the greatest parents of the day award goes to...
Anyone know what kind of pup that is?
The way the puppy went to nuzzle her at the end totally made the video for me <3
Heart-warming!
How in the hell did she not cry and I did!?!
The pup is all like ‚Äúhave you heard of scritches‚Äù
Wholesome
Seeing kids get dogs brings me joy
She didn't even cry
You get a puppy for our internet points!
What a lovely girl. A really sweet, genuine reaction without screaming and being OTT.
Love her innocent face while waiting lol
POG
I love how friendly that puppy is
I'm so glad she stayed calm! It weirdly bothers me, as adorable as it is, when children scream with excitement when they get a puppy! Poor puppy's ears!
Thanks for sharing this moment of happiness. I think we all need something like this from time to time, especially in a year that‚Äôs been as heavy as this one
Pure elation.
she's very happy
Not sure who's more happy. Your daughter, the puppy, or me. ü§ó
That pup is like 'you got me a girl?!?!'
Hits me in the feels remembering when my first dog picked me.

They're going to be the best of friends.
Both are very precious. Congrats to the kiddo.
Finally
I kinda want to get a dog, but I‚Äôm also nervous. My dog of 17 years passed away in April and getting a new dog means I‚Äôll have to go through the same process once it passes.
I love how gentle she is. Very nice to see. I know there's plenty of kids out there that would get over excited and treat it like a new toy
"Is that a puppy?"

No, it's an octopus. They're really good at camouflage.
Oh my god, she looks so happy.  I hope she is enjoying it
you're gonna be so glad you filmed this moment. Make sure to save it somewhere good. she's gonna want to revisit this moment decades from now.
A dog is a friend for life. There's no stronger bond than that of a human and canine. I still remember every dog I've owned and I plan to have more when my Buddy passes. If I can rescue a dog and give them a happy and healthy life that's good enough for me.
Finally a child that expresses joy without sobbing
this is one of my favorite memories with my cat when i was 7
This brought tears to my eyes. Not only happy tears but sad tears. I found out that my dog has cancer and is likely to die in a couple of weeks. Always love your dog
The way the pup looks up at her. It's like he saying, dis, dis my human.
Awww
My dad surprised me with a puppy for Valentines day when I was 14. I'm 27 and still have my old pup. üòä You bought your girl a lifelong friend!
"So you are my person? Nice to meet you. I love you."

Dogs are the best.
Gonna be a fun summer
I wish could put a puppy into someone‚Äôs arms.
Someone just got a best friend.
I love how she really appreciates it
This is the most precious, pure thing I‚Äôve ever seen. üò≠
Hard not to tear up over this.
I love the puppy looking up at her in the end, like he was thinking \*Are you my new best friend??\*
friendly reminder: **adopt don‚Äôt shop!**

(idk if OP went to a breeder or a shelter but regardless i still wanna throw this reminder out there. too many animals needlessly die in shelters because selfish fucks wanna get that new purebred pup instead of the older shelter dog.) 

[my sweet girl i adopted from a shelter. she is the light of my life.](https://i.imgur.com/Gvhm7Zh.jpg)
 I cry at ALL of these.
She‚Äôs going to be a good human mom to the puppy. PS What did you all name him or her?
When I was 10, I wanted a dog. My parents weren‚Äôt convinced until I turned 20.
Adopt! Don't shop!
I love her reaction!
My heart just smiled...
Just OD'd on all that wholesome
That warmed my cold undead heart
She‚Äôs so shocked. Like really? I can keep it!
Is she going to cry? Oh no! She's going to cry, please don't cry! Oh thank God, she didn't cry.... 
I'm in public.
The childhood I wish I had if it weren't for my complicated, hygiene freak parents
Gosh, this is so very special. What a beautiful little girl and a very, very handsome puppy. They will be great friends and have lots of fun together!
Just wait until it is cold and wet outside. Bet it's your dog then when it needs a walk. Happened to usüòÖ
Train your dog. Do not skip this. This video warms my heart but after the magic and the newness settles you will either have a terror or a well trained calm dog.
[deleted]
Beautiful, but puppies shouldn't be removed from their litters before 12 weeks for developmental reasons. Yes they can survive without at 8 weeks but they actually begin learning manners and stuff from remaining with their mother and the litter until a minimum of 12 weeks. This also HUGELY decreases separation anxiety and anxious behaviors in dogs. I'm sorry your breeder was misinformed.  You may want to consider seeing a behavioralist to head off those behaviors
[deleted]
pupper be like WTF humon, i ain't gonna pet myself
Who's chopping onions? Cut that out.
Cute but hope you adopted.
r/bettereveryloop
That‚Äôs a pretty cute puppy. Anyone would cry of joy if they‚Äôre received this puppy.
Nice work dad!
They're both super sweet
too darn cute
They are going to grow up together... \*wipes out happy tear\*
You and mom rock! Congratulations and big internet hugs to all of you!
They are smitten with each other!
Best parents ever
Omg she is handling them so sweetly too!
Every time I see one of these I always want to see the video of the first time they realize they have to now pick up poop. 

Dog are the most amazing little love and poop factories every created by nature.
That made me smile.
My heart has melted
Yay! Good for all y'all!
The moment they became best friends.
Based on this short clip, the pup seems really chill.
just cried at work. thanks.
Man kids are the best with animals they are always so gentle
Now i want a dog
I'm 30 and I still get that reaction to random people's dogs, no matter puppy or adult, passing on the sidewalk. Dogs are truly the happiest, cutest thing.
Hopefully this will be my reaction someday
Best day ever!
I wish I could upvote this more than once
This is really, really sweet. What a great kid, making sure not to scare the little puppy. They‚Äôre gonna be best friends.
I look forward to the day I own a pet so so much.
I love this stuff so so much, you're a good parent, :)
‚ÄúWe get a puppy~?‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha no‚Äù *picks up puppy and walks away*
ü•∞
Pure happiness. So wholesome.
When she said we get a puppy, totally should have said no times up.
This is so sweet, and also this pup looks exactly like a tiny baby version of one of my dogs, who was adopted at 3 so we never got to see what a puppy version of him would look like, especially because we don't really know what he's a mix of.  I feel like this puppy lets me imagine Jack as a little one :)
I love seeing videos like this. Getting to watch the first moments of a life-long friendship always makes me choke up.
Awesome!
why did I bring these onions to work?
A wonderful day!!!üíØüíò
I could watch people get surprise puppies all day.
Your daughter is as cute as the puppy ü§ó
You're a hero.
Yaay, I'm so happy for her!
Wholesome.
I do believe she's smitten.
That is heartwarming! Thanks for sharing :)
"Gonna love him, and hold him,  and squeeeeze him "
After deliberating and then looking for years, I absolutely shed tears when I came across what seemed like (and would become) it could be my first dog.  

3 years later, best decision ever, she's adorable.  :)
My daughter has pet allergies, what kind of dog do you furry friend lovers recommend?
Is that a Tibetan terrier? Fucking cute af
She looks incredibly compassionate and as if she will take good care of it! Sweet!
Adorable! I promise I‚Äôm not crying!
Why am I crying?! Ugh
Pure joy - long may it last.
i‚Äôm still waiting D: But so happy for your girl
Love when the lil pupper looks at the camera, then up at her at the end. You can already tell it‚Äôs the start of a beautiful relationship.
I feel like she cant believe its real! I know the feeling. I pick up my girl in 6 weeks. I hope you have years and years of endless fun and snuggles!
thank you for waiting until the puppy was old enough to ween naturally from its mother.
Growing up I always wanted a dog, but my dad is highly allergic to them, so I was never able to have one. When my husband and moves into our house, I begged him for months. For Christmas that year, he got me a 10 month old red beagle. That was 4 years ago, and she's my absolute world.
instant love
And that little stare up at her the pup gives.  Almost like "Hi...I love you" ü•∞
Instant love both ways
Its amazing how much love you can have for a single small creature.
Focus. FOCUS!
In a shit and gloomy world this brought a smile to my face.
The dog just looks confused lol
I came here for years. Downvote!!!!





....I‚Äôm just kidding
Recording a video in landscape. You da real MVP.
Where are the tears! I want tears!!!!
Pure joy! I love how she‚Äôs calm and sweet with the puppy too
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Aaand here come the onions again.
Internet has broken me, i was waiting for the tears
Now I want a child and a puppy lol
that‚Äôs so cute, what will be her name?
Captured the first time the dog ever sniffed her.
This is so wholesome
OMG SO CUTE
When the pupper looks up. You can just tell they're gonna be besties. :)
Cute, but not going to lie, I expected a much bigger reaction. I would have been an absolute mess if I was her.
Expressions like that is what parents live for
Aww if my parents allowed pets in the home I would have gotten my girls a puppy like 2 Xmas ago. 

Trying to move out someplace that allows pets so I can get one ‚ò∫
/r/MadeMeSmile
Love at first sight. So sweet.
I would have bawled my eyes out. So special.
Great moment to share
I‚Äôm crying
OP, you did an amazing job raising your daughter. This is probably the first reactiom video I've ever seen of a child not screaming and scaring the crap out of the dog. She's so gentle.

Its so obvious she's going to be super responsible when it comes to taking care of her new puppy. This made me smile so much.
This is literally too pure? I love that, I hope your kid is so happy rn :')
Im crying right now. This is too cute
I'd love to have parents like that
The way that pup looks at her at the end. Bonding is complete.
I still remember waiting on my parents arriving home with our first dog. I was so excited and then my dad got out the car with a wee black poodle!That wee black poodle grew into a giant of a dog and was loved by everyone privileged enough to stroke his woolly coat.
RIP Levi the standard poodle. Miss you bud.
Aw man you made me cry. My daughter is 3 1/2 and has been asking for a dog during quarantine.  Eventually I'm going to have to send you my daughters reaction as a form of closure.
Oh I would be crying for sure.
Pure joy. I love it!
You're daughter appears extremely well adjusted. Thankful but not crazed like a lot of people on the internet. Kudos on raising her.
Love at first sight. The dog looking up at her is too cute.
Dopamine slapping
Ah I feel my heart strings tugged, this was nice to see today
I hope I get a dog soon, all my life I‚Äôve wanted one but never lived anywhere that allowed it...one day I‚Äôll have a dog, then and only then, will I finally be happy
Is there a subreddit for people being gifted pets?
I don't think I ever don't tear up at these.
Live at first sight! BFFs forever!!
Can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs her or the puppy making those high pitched noises.
Aww
I swear I wish my husband would as a 22 year old I would bawl my eyes out.
Those two are going to be best buds for years!
This is the sweetest thing I've seen all week
The start of a beautiful friendship!
What‚Äôs the puppies name!  Super cute dog!
I always wanted a puppy as a kid what a happy moment that must be! You love to see it..
Every kid should have a puppy.
I needed this smile today :)
It‚Äôs hard to see people living your dream üòî
Beautiful gesture, pure happiness üòäüòä
And i‚Äôve seen kids crying when they get a puppy or a kitten
My dad got me a pup when I turned 10 after many years of begging. My good boy passed away just last year and I am now 26. 


The best thing my parents could have ever done for me. Through bullying, puberty, breakups, final exams, job hunting anxiety- I could always come home to those good pats and kisses. You're a good parent ‚ù§Ô∏è
Best friend she'll ever have.
I wish this was me
There is no more perfect a match in this world than a kid and a puppy.
So wholesome :)) nice
you can see the puppy fall in love with her. üò≠
This really cheered me up!  :)
Best buds for life
Perfect, new love for both of them. Congratulations.
So cuuuuuuute look at her cheeks before and after the reaction
That doggo looks happy.
Such a cute puppy! Congratulations! That little furball will bring your daughter a lifetime of joy and friendship. :)
That brought some well needed joy to my day. Much appreciated. Hope she has fun with her new puppy.
My first puppy came when I was 14 and I‚Äôm a boy, I held him and cried like a complete baby, she strong af
So awesome. Instantly in love!
Not gonna lie, bit of an underwhelming reaction than what I was expecting from the title. I would've been a weeping mess.
Omg this dog looks exactly like the puppy I‚Äôm sitting! What kind? Mine is a cavachon.
I love how the puppy looks up and says "hello friend...."
A cute little girl who now has a faithful friend.  Wishing them years of happiness
What‚Äôs the puppy‚Äôs name OP?

And congrats on new family member
I‚Äôve been asking for a dog like 11 years now. 



I‚Äôm still asking
Is it a Havanese? Looks a ton like this little buddy laying under my desk did as a puppy. Congrats to her, she's unlocked one of the best love stories of her life.
My mom told me 10 years ago that I will get a puppy tomorrow 

I still don‚Äôt have a puppy
Nice dog
Awww the way it looked at her in the end! he was like ‚Äúim all yours friend‚Äù:)
thought you can't sell/adopt puppies less than 3 months
"I got a puppy! :O"
Something about her/ her reaction reminds me of the little girl in the Christmas movie Prancer.
Best parent award.
This is beautiful, the purest form of love. We just witnessed a lifelong friendship being formed.
How I act around almost all dogs at 29 üòÇüòÇ
I'm in a good mood. It will protect her, and walk beside her. Always loyal. As long as she is she takes care of it.
...she didn't even cry tho
Really admirable.
Nice to see a kid who is happy like that, not like those little mental mung bags who start bawling like they‚Äôve shit themselves in class.
Spontaneous bonding.
I love how calm she is so as not to scare the pup. Gorgeous moment.
She should have cried. Why the hell am I crying?!
Holy crap that‚Äôs a cute dog.
Those are the sounds I made when my parents gifted me a kitty for my birthday.
Now that's her responsibility, all the dog poop is hers to deal with.
I will remember the first time I held each one of my dogs for all of my life. Such a special moment. Nice OP‚Äîsuper special.
That dog looks like a straight chiller üòé
That dog looks at her like ‚Äúwe‚Äôre gonna be best friends. We‚Äôre gonna get in so much trouble together.‚Äù
I‚Äôm a 24 year old man. And that‚Äôs still my reaction everytime someone hands me a dog.
There's a sub for dogs getting dogs but is there one for humans?
So happy, keep us updated. I'm curious what she will name the little dude.
I can't wait for the day I can do this with my girlfriend. Gotta have to wait probably for a few more years but it will be wonderful. :)
I love how gentle and quiet your daughter is. She's going to be a great dog-mom.
Just about perfect!! 
Good job.
That‚Äòs the start of a lovely friendship there, joyous!
My favorite video is of this little girl who gets a kitten and she immediately starts crying but she picks up the kitten and just holds the kitten and doesn‚Äôt scream or anything but love the little baby
this is my same reaction. as a 40yo man
OMG, both of them are so cute <33
Awww  .,Sooo cute expressions..lovely‚ô•Ô∏è
That is so beautiful and adorable at the same time!
They were ready for each other. Too cute
That‚Äôs so awesome! Thanks for sharing.
What a sweetheart!
My reaction was the same
Good job, parents! Wish mine would have gotten us a dog when we were kids. Now I have 2 though :) But I'm also almost 40 haha
Little dog lovers getting dogs is my favorite video genre. So sweet!
The dog has claimed a home.
She sounds like a crying puppy hehe. Jokes aside this is adorable.
My fiance surprised me with a puppy last year after I'd been saying I wanted one for years and I literally started crying haha
She knew all along what it was gonna be
This is the beginning of something beautiful.
I like how puppy and girl hit it off in the first 20 seconds like they are long lost friends.
Nice to see one of these posts without somebody breaking down into tears. Like that's great, but it's so overplayed. I'm happy to see a more down to earth reaction.
There is good in the world after all...
What an incredible gift of love!! Congratulations on your new baby. üòäüíï
well i know someone who doesnt want to go for a walk every fing day in a few years
I‚Äôm 31 years old and have had many dogs and currently do, my Dream is someone to gift me a puppy like that.
Good for her. You done good, OP.
Aww the cutest part was when the puppy was looking up at her! Too cute!
that's years of a beautiful loving friendship starting right there
That is a very chill puppy.
#mynewhuman
That made my day.
It‚Äôs funny how a puppy can turn you into a little kid again for a moment almost no matter what your age is. This was really sweet. 


I‚Äôm sitting on my back patio watching this then I look up to see my dog squatting about 20 feet in front of me taking a shit with it pointed right at me. 


I love dogs.
This made me smile :)
It's awesome that they can grow up together.
So sweet and wholesome. Remembering things like this helped me finally understand that my "I don't really like people" attitude of my youth was actually false.
I'm almost 40, and this is still my reaction every time I get a new pupper ‚ù§Ô∏è
That puppy: ‚Äúare we going to be best friends for ever?‚Äù
Soo happy for your family man. That‚Äôs beautiful. 

Makes me miss my doge so much üò≠
Thanks. I needed a bit of positive MOJO today.  And no, I don't know why my phone wants to capitalize mojo.  Well now it doesn't.

Anyhow, kids and puppies good!
Ahh... finally some good food
This has made me want to get a puppy for my daughter!!!
Sarsha. Dont worry. I will NEVER do that! Ive seen that in r/iamapieceofshit she will forwver be with me untill she dies cause maltesers (with good healthcare) can live for 18 years! Or 20.
Can y‚Äôall contact my dad please- I want this so bad üò≠üò≠
Aww they love each other, your daughter has a wonderfully calm energy
Me whenever I see a dog ever
Could only see the puppy.
This feels like a stick-upvote. Go ahead take it. Just don‚Äôt hurt me .
Should have gotten her a cat.
She's so gentle with it! Looks like she's going to be a good dog mama.
In for the inevitable

>please don‚Äôt gift puppies 

>adopt don‚Äôt shop

I have a 20 year old dog that looks like this and I always think how our relationship is beyond years and evolution and we crossed planes to be soul mates and I‚Äôm watching this and crying for all the little girls and their best dog friends.
As a grown man, if you put a dog in my hands, my face would be exactly the same
I can‚Äôt wait until I‚Äôm 30 and can afford this moment. I look forward to experiencing her joy.
So sweet! Your daughter is going to have a best friend that will guide her and provide kisses through life's ups and downs, I'm so happy for you guys!
That is greatüòä
This was so me when i was smaller, my parents did drive me to pick it myself but i was so hyped
I hope they become the best of friends ü•∫ that's genuinely adorable
Awesome parenting. Core memory....created
Gotta love it!
Now thats some whole wheat bread
I‚Äôm a grown man, and I cried when I got my dog home for the first time. So did my wife lol. Nothing greater than a dog.
That pupper is in love already!
There are few things quite so heartwarming as witnessing the joy a puppy can bring to your child.
Oh my gosh this is precious. The little puppy looks at her with adoration
What kind of pupper is this? I must know.
Wonderful. And that puppy loves her to the end and back already.
Thanks for making the world a better place!
So sweet that girl might have a dog.
Crying üò≠
AWWE HYPE
I cried when I watched this and I don't know why
I will love him and squeeze him and kiss him and love him. And I will name him George!
Awww, looks like it was love at first sight for the pup too!
Aww she just met her best friend.
That is just too sweet! I hope she takes good care of it and loves it and takes it out for lots of rucks.
r/Bestmomever
Very sweet!!! üòç‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
I love how gentle she was and didn‚Äôt scream or any annoying shit like that haha. I wanted my own dog since 6 years old and FINALLY at 21 I got her.... it really is a life changing experience.
I think my face is going to break from smiling.
Awwww! This is sooooo sweet! Congrats to all of you! Your daughter looks so happy and appreciative. I teared up.
Honestly it should be illegal to voluntarily not grow up with a pet
priceless
My heart!!!! I remember when my parents surprised me with a kitten on Christmas after being told time and time again I definitely couldn‚Äôt EVER have one.  It‚Äôs the best feeling in the whole world, I bet this kiddo is ecstatic
this will be me when i finally get a dog of my own, even it happens when im 100
So cute this just made my day! It‚Äôs so heartwarming ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
*Everyone liked that
That reaction is priceless!!
Best friends for life, judging by the way that gooder looked at her, good job dad
The best thing is that the dog will be there for her through her teenage years, and that is just amazing.

My teenage years where filled with allot of different emotions and I would always go to my dogs to let it all out by petting them.
Nice... but you just know when the novelty wears off mums gonna pick up the poop n do the walks, feed it , take it to the vets, and then they‚Äôll be inseparable ‚ù§Ô∏è...the daughter will have a boyfriend by then!
Aw so precious!  My second childhood dog was  a surprise. I remember my dad coming home with a tiny black pup in his hands and I just about died from excitement. I miss you, Bonnie Jean!
Unconditional love from the very first second...! <3
I'm pretty sure she's trying to sneak a peek at one point.
There are fewer things as wholesome as when a little kid gets a puppy or other baby animal and just can‚Äôt handle the cuteness overload.
This made me sob my eyes out. We just said goodbye to my dog of 17 years, who I received as a puppy by surprise exactly like this, on my 10th birthday. 
You are good parents. I am so thankful for the many years of memories my sweet girl gave us. 
You have so much to look forward to!
Too cute
The truest form of love at first sight.
I WANNA SEE THEM PLAY NOW
Ok this made me cry like a baby!! She was so sweet and gentle!!
O.K., some things are good in this world
I would have fell of the couch
Thank you!

My dad wouldn‚Äôt get me a puppy until finally when I was like 10 or 11 he was kinda forced too (long story). As someone in a very rough neighbourhood and very few friends that puppy changed my life

They are gonna be the best of friends forever from now on.
Breh I been asking my parents for 22 years and still no dog, feels bad man
aww ü•∫ü•∫
Girl suck up that oxytocin
Aww how sweet ü•∫
I remember my parents did this to me when I least expected it , I was waiting for them to come back for the whole day while they had travelled and at night when I was so sleepy they brought the little pupper to surprise me
This is beyond beautiful
This is why I love Reddit! I didn‚Äôt even search for this, but I‚Äôm so glad I found it
She‚Äôs gonna love that doggie way past college
Ahh....  that's so cool !!  I love her reaction !  She's going to be a great little mommy !   Also thanks for almost bringing a tear to a Marine's eye.
I love how pupper looks up and seals the deal
No tears... don‚Äôt worry. Plenty of here
...and my mind skips forward to a sad time awaiting her in her twenties.

Man, life is short.
Awesome
I was honestly expecting shrill screams. I am impressed at her restraint, I think she will be a good dog taker-care-of-er.
Puppy sez "I get a girl ?!?  ".
I hope you give that pup all the boops
I wanted a parakeet for 15 years. Still haven‚Äôt got one.
The food has arrived
Smiles for miles ! üëç
omg, so happy she will have this memory forever
I‚Äôm sure your choice was exactly what she would have picked out herself
Me and the wife got our daughter a puppy on her 8th birthday, that was 7 years ago, and those 2 are still inseparable!
10.5 weeks is perfect. You did good. Best wishes for a very long, healthy life together.
Its actually moms dog, but they say its hers.
So so sweet
I wanted to see happy tears
I feel too much!
We're gonna need future pics of the beautiful friendship.
I have been begging my parents for a cat but they never want me to have one
*sigh* 22 years and still going
It's been a weird long day and this definitely made me cry (happy tears)
Thats a pog moment
Sooooooooooo, Sweet
BFFs for life
Nice. 

Mom dad when‚Äôs my turn it‚Äôs been 16 years please I‚Äôm begging you
Bow wow wow wow yo yibby yay
i now see why they call this subreddit r/aww
Thanks for sharing!  I was only a little younger than she was when I got my first dog, and he passed a few days ago. They are always great companions, but especially when you're growing up!
As someone who's lived with dogs all their life, thank you for that. No kid should have to grow up without a pet. Animals just make life so much better, especially if your childhood isn't exactly going as planned.
Is this kid made of stone? I fully expected tears.
That made me happy.   Thanks, subby, I needed that.
Gib doggo many pats and kisses
I expected a scream, I was pleasantly surprised.
Love at first sight from both!
Best day ever!!!
Get a crate
She‚Äôs gonna actually take care of it right? Not get bored of it after a month and not care?
She didn't cry... NOT HAPPY ENOUGH!  :)
Morkie's are great. Mine just snuggles all the time. And is bullied by our husky...
You can feel a genuine reaction vs all the played garbage we get to see. 

Heart warming.
Did you see the moment? Love at first site!
r/mademesmile
This is honestly the best thing I‚Äôve seen all week.
Ohh my soo sweet
that is so great
That last frame says it all
Behold the beginning of a never ending friendship..
This was my very favorite thing that I upvoted all day today. Having a puppy is a wonderful thing when you‚Äôre spending all your time at home quarantined, too. We wouldn‚Äôt be sane without our dog in the house, keeping us all cheered up and on an even keel.
Is someone cutting onions?
My heart just sings when I watch this.  Beautiful!
Aww indeed
Congratulations!  Love this.  We are doing the same thing at the end of July.  This is exactly what is making it worth it.
I have one question is she 10? because if it‚Äôs a 10 week old puppy that would be  perfect!
I want one. How can I get one??
Damn that‚Äôs a long wait for a üê∂
This just made my day, and I have been blessed by this very post. Thank you for sharing this.
Nice
Don't forget the peanut butter.
Take care of the puppy, so puppy can become good dog
The puppy likes the girl too
So cute!!!!
This is so wholesome. Thank you
That's one of the sweetest things I've ever seen
ITS JUST MY ALLERGIES OK. ü•∫
Lifetime buds.
Doggo good
Their going to grow up together and be the best of friends
She will remember that moment forever. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I knew this video would make my day.
This put a big smile on my face
made me cri
Grown men do cry
well behaved puppy. my pup cant sit for more than 2 seconds
Forever friends.
These are the best moments in life.
Very responsible decision! Hope it'll be her best friend.
Reminds me of when I got my Shepherd
Adopt, don't shop, guys
Those two are gone great friends
Come on, don't your post your daughter who his too young to understand the value of privacy on the internet for millions of people to see. That's not right.
You should wait until the pupps are 12 weeks before separating them from mom.
Thanks OP, I needed something to smile about this morning.
I highly recommend turning the sound on if you haven‚Äôt already.
Got the same reaction when I surprised my daughter with an iPhone XR two days ago
Perfection.
First one I've ever seen where the little girl doesn't cry! Lol, still wholesome
r/wholesome
Aww instant face touches!!!!
Exploiting your child for internet points. Why.
SERIOUS to all the parents. What you think? Make it a surprise or have them go with you and pick the dog they want? I'm not a parent but I'm leaning more toward having them pick.

EDIT: Thanks for your input. The going consensus makes sense.
She is going to be a great pet owner. I can just tell it.  You can see the sheer joy come over her.... great clip thank you for sharing.  \*wow watched it again and this got a 6'2 240 pound 41 year old bearded diesel mechanic to tear up\*
I always see the videos where kids cry for like 5 minutes when they're given a pet or a gift they've really been wanting. Your daughters reaction is so much better! Just pure happiness!
So... did you ask your daughter if she wanted to be internet famous before posting this? Because I'd be pretty angry at my parents for violating my privacy like that.
[removed]
Not to burst anyone's bubble but puppies should only be purchased from 12 weeks up, they need to learn skills from their parents and siblings. Your puppy might have biting and anger issues later in life
Awww! Where‚Äôd you rescue from?
[deleted]
I have a little rescue and he is amazing!
Nice to meet you hooman I am yours now
I like how she's making the same sounds excited puppies make. They'll get along great ü§ó
Wholesome level.... Over 9000!
im fucking crying in the club rn
I'm just gonna go ahead an upvote the heck out of this.
Someone surprised me with a new dog but it turned out to be a honey badger. Not my favorite birthday present.
I‚Äôm 27 and I would 100% still react this way. I would probably cry tbh
That was my reaction when my dad came home with a puppy malteser :D shes the reason i am not bored in quarantine
[removed]
My understanding is that puppies should not be taken from their mother before 12 weeks. It's not good for their development.
can't be bothered to read all the comments, but i'm sure someone mentioned getting a sheltered pup
"Hello Hooman, are you my new best friend?"
Nice. :) I wish them a happy life together. 

Bitter old man side note: I was fully expecting your daughter to break down into tears, but she didn't. It's nice to see a happy, stable child.
We just got a pup..turned 10wks yesterday. 

Lots of work...I know it will be you guys waking up at 11 1 and 4 to let em pee. You guys are saints. Also the crate training crying...tell your daughter not to give in. May take 20mins..but dont falter. Tax https://imgur.com/oPh2924.jpg
What type of dog is that?
What is the breed?
And my 10 year okd sister cant even feed her hamsters. Can we trade kids?
Me 2 but I never got one ;)
Love at first sight!
The surprise is sweet, but theres something about a kid picking their first puppy that I find more preferable
Wait the puppy looks like my dog when we first got her. Happen to know what type of dog it is?
[deleted]
Is this a little Morkie pup? It looks so much like my little Morkie Max when he was a puppy.
Cool. What is the dog‚Äôs name?
You want her to be happier

You want her to be happier
Aww-some!

What shelter did you rescue from??
What breed is this? I wanna get myself my first puppy but keep reading about shedding, barking, health issues, separation anxiety :( need something cute and small that will be happy alone while I work... i am afraid of larger dogs.. hate jack russells... love shih tzus but everyone says they bark and have health issues :(
aww she‚Äôs gonna be the bestest big sister ever.
Everyone liked that
Everyone liked that.
Start of an unbreakable bond ü•∫
This could've been me. But my parents didn't want to get a dog.
Say goodbye to all your socks folks.
Usually homies be crying when they get the doggo
34 year old grown ass man here realizing I'm smiling noticeably and tearing up a bit...screw you op, I was feeling manly today
well if this didn't have me grinning ear to ear...
imagine the disappointment when she  realizes thats its the neighbour's dog and it stays only for the night
That face of unbridled joy. I‚Äôm not crying everyone else is crying üò≠
What did you name the pup??
It is very cute but what would have been funny would have been if when she asked if she got a puppy the parents just said no and walked away with the dog.




I have to clarify that I am joking so that I don‚Äôt get downvoted into oblivion.
Why don‚Äôt we have a sub just full of kids getting puppies?!?!
Edit: there is now a sub for kids getting puppies ü§£
Awww ü•∞
Lol my parents did this to me but it was a statue of a dog. Not a real one. I got very sad.
That's so beautiful! I can tell she'll cherish her dog forever.
y‚Äôall can downvote me but i‚Äôm kinda happy she wasn‚Äôt one of the kids who just starts crying like a banshee when they get a puppy but this is awesome
She‚Äôs in for a lifetime of friendship :)
One of the best feelings in the universe.
The way the puppy looks up at her is the cutest thing I have seen in years.
God I wish that were me
Crazy how people are fighting in the comments, literally a video of a child receiving a puppy lmao
and they say love at first sight doesn't exist..
Can we appreciate the fact that the puppy just sorta looks up at her like ‚Äúyes this is my human, and I shall protect her all I can and she‚Äôll protect me.‚Äù 

My mum always says that pets seem to choose you. Aside from recusing some cats from a shelter for killing rats at our farm, we‚Äôve never brought any of our cats. They‚Äôre all strays or children of strays. They‚Äôve become lovely pets and have made my entire childhood.
I remember when our dog came home. I was so excited each day that I couldn't sleep at night because I wanted to see her and all I could think about when i was at school was our puppy waiting for us at home. She was the best dog ever!
Coakapoo? What‚Äôs his name?
I can‚Äôt wait to surprise my (future) kid like this some day.
Magical
She's at the beginning of many years of happy memories.  

I miss my dog.  Love you, Cana.
So wholesome üëç
as does the pup
I know that feeling. I'm 50 years old and I still feel that way when we get a new dog. ü§≠
i‚ÄôM NoT cRYiNg YOu‚ÄôrE CRyiNg
You damn well sure she wanted to hug that puppy tight as anything but showed alot of self restraint
My parents surprised me this exact same way after asking for just as long, she was my absolute best friend for 15 years and brought my family so much joy
Why do I cry when children and doggos are mixed together? 

THE CHILD ISN'T EVEN CRYING ABOUT IT AND I'M FANNING OFF PUDDLES.
Adorable üòç
My lab was so annoying when I first had him he would constantly steal things from me and taunt me
Precious.
Nawww so cute I love it :D
The wait is finally over! Love this :)
[deleted]
Why does a kid getting a puppy always make me cry?
Looks like a labradoodle of some kind. Best dogs.
Man I just watched her fall in love in about 6 seconds. So beautiful.
it‚Äôs impressive that she held herself together because she knew she didn‚Äôt wanna scare the dog. she‚Äôs gonna be a great puppy mama
I'll never forget when my mom told me we got a new dog. 

We had a family dog for as long as I had conscious memory, I was like 13 at the time and on my way home from football practice. 

My mom told me our older sister who had already moved out had found an abandoned dog in a stairwell and it was at our house....okay.....we're keeping it.....HOLY FUCK WHAT THE FUCK WE GOT A NEW DOG FLOOR IT MOM WTF!?!!!?
I love my dog but the puppy months sucked
That‚Äôd pretty fucked up if they said ‚ÄúSIKE!‚Äù
We did this with my son. He had been asking forever. I finally caved.
Where are the happy tears?!? 

Just kidding, this is so sweet! Love how gentle she is right away
"Now go get dressed - you got school in 15 minutes!"
This melts my heart
She pogged
Breed?
They're friends fur life now üíúüê∂
(Sorry for the pun)
that made me smile üòä
I'm 40 and cry at Disney Princess Movies...Why would you do this to ME!
wish we could have a pet but nephew kept hurting them So we can't have one.
Ah shit wrong tab
‚ÄúI got a puppy!?‚Äù

No, you got a pig
It would have been funny if you just gave her a cat
I always wanted a kitten and my family was at a beach. My dad said he had a surprise and set a kitten in my lap. I was so happy but it turned out he had adopted 4 free kittens and was using them as cobia/shark bait. üò§
where did you get it from?
she really said *POGCHAMP*



Edit thanks for the downvotes
Fake, she doesn't cry!
Good job asshole! You made her cry in 15 years....
So cute. Is it me, or does she have massive legs?
What took you so f**king long?
Watch out; the Yorkie part will endear you all. And will require extra patience in housebreaking.
Look we brought us crying in a couple of years
AAAW! Tell the doggo it is good, and tell your daughter "Congrats, kiddo. You've broken your parents and they've gotten you a dog."
Why do I get the feeling that a fleeting thought of your daughter's was, "They're going to put this on Reddit aren't they...". ;) Hope the puppers brings you years of happiness!
What did u name him/her
Please be aware of the fact that the internet (and Reddit) is full of pedos and some people might pleasure themselves to those expressions. Please show restraint in publicly sharing the videos of your daughters.
*their reaction
It looks like love at first sight for both of them.  Thank you for sharing this.  It really made me smile.  :)
‚ÄúFor years‚Äù. Is 12
Egg
Priceless.....
Well if she look 9 how oils she of been asking for 10 years
Ah so u all knew u shouldn't be doing that. Hope u  grew out of that mean behavior.
I wish this was me :(
Did you at least eat it?
Why would you post your kids on public internet?
is there a sub for the opposite of r/watchpeopledieinside ?
Hmm. Would've been nice if this was authentic. She already 'knows' she's getting the dog due to her outstretched hands so not sure what she's so shocked about when she finds one there.
Guess what we're having for dinner!
 /u/vredditshare
Bit shocked that I‚Äôm noticing your daughter over the puppy (as someone who‚Äôs very into dogs) but she‚Äôs so sweet and loving. Can‚Äôt get over her reaction and how gentle she is, im so impressed.
Genuine question, why not adopt?
