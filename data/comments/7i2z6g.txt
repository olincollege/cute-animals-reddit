That kid has more guts than I do when it comes to meeting new people.
My daughter is a hugger. She is four and will hug anyone. Stranger sitting alone in a restaurant?  You get a hug. Sketchy Panhandler?  You get a hug!

It's all very cute until it's not cute.  It is tough telling a child to love less, but if I didn't stop her she would just travel across the world giving sketchy people hugs. 
What you guys don't know is that [hugging is a cop's tactic to unarm criminals.](https://i.imgur.com/jDwqFRw.gifv)
Yeah, a kid does this and it's "adorable."
 
I do it and it's "disorderly conduct."
Hug 'da police!
As a cop, this is always heartwarming. I had a little guy run up to me in Costco a few weeks ago while working security for the holidays and give me a hug before running off. Definitely the highlight of my day. 
The nervous walk, the little run back. My heart is melting 😊
This made my day. Thank you!
We don't start out shitty.
Realest aww ever :-)
I suddenly have dust in my eyes
That made me smile.  Looks like my son and he loves firefighters,  police,  etc. too.  :) 
This was me as a child, if I felt threatened by something (naturally a police officer or anyone of authority) I would want to hug it. Not sure why quite. 
As a kid I would never have the courage to go up to any stranger like that. Good for you kid
Melts my heart man. If only the rest of the world were like this everywhere. 
Thank you. This is what I needed after reading all this political bullshit. 
All I see is Ving Rhames from Dawn of the Dead
I feel like I've seen this username before.... where is it from? Oh yeah, u/dickfromaccounting is dominating the homepage rn!
My inner self tells me this was a mom that told her nice little obedient kid to "to give the cop a hug and thank him".....I hope im wrong.
I love this so much! Kids love police officers. My son's stepfather is a cop and he loves the fact that he's a cop
haha cute! The world isn't always shit.
My son did the same thing when he was 5. The officer then took him outside to turn the lights on the police car. My son just graduated from the Detroit Police Academy last month. I am so proud of him, fulfilling his dream.
Look at OP's other "organic and wholesome" posts that they most certainly didn't steal/post for internet points.
This is actually the first post on r/aww that actually made me audibly aww. And I could not be more pleased by that fact.
 This was awesome to see.
Children don't see black or white, they see a person keeping their city safe, someone they can speak to when there's a problem 
Talk all the shit you want but it doesn't matter if you're black white male female etc., the overwhelming majority of police officers will go out of their way to help you with petty issues that aren't even in their job description. 
That was damn cute. 
I remember this.

https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/626anb/this_little_boy_asked_his_mom_if_he_could_go_hug/
So much division right now. This is nice. 
Plot twist: They both have the Shining
Hug the police coming straight from the playground.
I just watched a white male, possibly ginger,  toddler sexually harass an African American police officer.... this world is never ceasing to surprise and sicken me at the same time!
This makes me wonder how a police officer would react if I tried to lovingly embrace them.  Prolly be subdued.
Yeah i dont doubt his mom asked him to do that for views 
Honey guess what? A kid just hugged me today.

Our little boy without knowing turned on the rusty machine that had been off for so long and the heart started to beat once again, the officer remembered what it was like to feel what other people feel and he treated every suspect with respect and love and that love was spread quietly but surely among all the people.
And now, Timmy, mankind has finally found peace.
I might be an asshole, I assumed whoever is filming put the kid up to it. Kids not looking back for permission, he's looking back to confirm his orders.
Idk, obviously.
Is it just me or does this seem incredibly staged 
I believe 99.999% cops are good people..like any other job. When my dog was hit by a car the officer drove my to the vet..called later to check that I had recovered my second dog and even sent me an article on FB about grief and losing pets. Good man.
"Hug The Police" was heartwarming but it didn't sell as many albums.
THE LITTLE RUN AT THE VERY END this melted my heart and I feel revived and strengthened going into finals 
A kid (maybe like 8)hugged me when I was waiting for a coffee at starbucks. I got my wallet stolen.
Moral of the story: Don't go to starbucks
The cop seems like a sweetie
I feel like this kid didn’t even want to hug the officer, but his parent wanted him to for a chance to get a viral video. 
Re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-re-repost

Wutchu gunna do when this HUG'S FOR YOOUUUU!!  
(COPS is filmed on location with the men and women of law enforcement)
I remember this one time I was in a Japanese snack mart, and these two girls were running around the store and the mom let them be. When I was in the line, they were in front of me and the little girl was talking to me. She was telling me how she made her own bracelet and I told her that’s so cool. She kept talking to me and asked me my age and all that. 
The Mom turned around and gave that Seinfeld in the movie theaters look. That old “over the shoulder glare” like I just farted.
Some people just aren’t people-friendly and that’s the kind of world we live in.
"I dare you to go hug this police, I give you 5$ if you do! Momma gonna make a viral video"
Kids a narc
"Oi kid! Go up and hug the cop! I need karma!"
I love cops man, always out there for the community, doing a job most would not sign up for. Hats off to them all.
HUG THE POLICE
Children. Only human beings who are purest by heart. ❤️
Some of us like to remind cops that some of us still appreciate them

I always remind cops and emt's/paramedics that they are appreciated. 
As I bet that he made that guys day. :)
I was a big hugger when I was younger, which is weird because I hate everyone now.
I needed this after I watched that video about the policemen that shot the man after giving confusing directions
"Go hug that officer so mommy can get Facebook likes!"  "Yes, he's black, that gives me karma too"
Is this some kind of alternate universe?
Okay, but where are the puppies other baby animals???
It’s so cute) now I want a t-shirt with “HUG THE POLICE”
Can the world return to this please.
Thank you to the men and women who have dedicated their lives to protecting the people of this country.
“Hey go over and hug the policeman while I videotape you”
You mean little boy told to hug officer by parents in pursuit of attention on social media
Fuck off with this repost
"Hey can my kid come over and give you a hug while I film?"

"Uhh yeah sure that's alright"

"Go over to that officer and give him a hug sweetie. Mary is gonna flip over how many likes this will get."
And that's how you kill racism. 
Is there a subreddit of doing nice thing for police officers? I love this kind of stuff.
Glad to see people in this thread posting hate towards these two are getting downvoted

People need to realize that the majority of cops are people just like you and I. A vast majority are nice and decent people. Why do you think you hear more stories about cops being nice to people than stories about cops shooting black people?
Tellement mignon. :)
r/humansbeingbros
It's ok to be
Watch out ned hes coming right for you!
I tried to get myself out of a traffic incident this way. Would not recommend trying. :/
AM I BEING DETAINED?!?!?!?!?
this is too wholesome for my cynical soul
Great kid, nice cop
I had almost forgotten this sub wasn’t dedicated to just animals. 
OMG, I must be way too tired, because this made me wanna cry just from how precious this is. 
/r/MadeMeSmile
This is the most forced thing I’ve seen a parent do to a child.. oh and a repost!!
Later that day officer Jack couldn't find his phone and wallet anymore. 
Just awesome... no, more than awesome!!! :D
Cute boy.He is so adorable.
Probably he likes police and he wants to become policeman
This is the cutest shit I’ve seen all week
This post made me realise how jaded and cynical I've become. Now I'm just sad. 


Need more this in the world
"Can I hug the police officer, mom?"
"Sure, just let me get my camera so I can get those useless internet points!"
That police officer is a giant. 
"got yer wallet!!!! Tee hee hee.."
HE HAS A GUN, SHOOT
This was posted on reddit about 50 times now.
I was waiting for the kid to punch the cop lol
we have our next police officer.
Imo they get payed too little, but that's another subject
Bet that made the police offers day more than the little lad. The innocent of a child is a magical power
"HE REACHED FOR MY GUN"
Cops were superheroes to me when I was a little kid.
I love how all of these light hearted posts are posted by people called GallowBoob or two_inches_of_fun or dickfromaacounting 
STOP RESISTING!!!
CNN be like: white male attempts to strange black police officer 
I sorted by controversial. Not as bad as I thought.  This sub is great
if the kid was black and the officer was white, i believe the little kid would have been shot in the face
This moment is more social then my life
Too bad adults lose the ability to hug random people. 
He totally stole his wallet. 
I work in healthcare and a young boy (probably 5 or 6) was very scared that his mom wasn’t ok. I had to take her down for a test and I assured him I would take care of her. He held out his pinky and we pinky promised. About an hour later I brought her back and after we got her situated back in her bed he tugged at my scrubs. He looked up at me and smiled and said “thank you for keeping your promise” and gave me a hug. Made my week. 
Am I the only person who sees a kid whose parent said “go hug that guy” (total stranger) and then filmed what happened?  The slow approach, looking back, hesitant, then when he does it he looks back like “ok I did it can I come back now?”  This seemed totally obvious to me the first time I watched and even more so each subsequent time I watched it. 
"But why do I have to go hug him?"

"Because I need some karma and I have a great title in mind"
Reddit truly is a weird place. Finding people downvoting a post just because it has a police officer, yknow that guy vowed to protect and serve just like our US armed forces do. He and many others like him are why you get to feel safe and secure in this country.
Policeman, the hero!
You can tell the parent told them to do it just for the karma.
[deleted]
What a roller coaster trying to figure out the Reddit narrative here.

*reads title*

"Hm...maybe an anti-cop post where the cop refuses and that's why the title says 'just wants  to.'"

*sees r/aww*

"No...it must be something nice if it's on r/aww. Wow, could it just be a positive interaction with a cop on Reddit? Did hell freeze over?"

*watches video*

"Ooooohhhhhh...it's a white kid hugging the hero black cop. Damn, how did i miss that one?"
This is super sweet. 
Hug, hug. Hug the POlice!
Leave it to Reddit to turn a cute gif like this into some bullshit race issue from the left and the right. Fuck right off
Staged topical irrelevancy.
Bless his little heart
Too damn cute
This is a prime example of you're not born racist, you're taught to be racist!
Hell yeah. I hope that made his day.
How sweet! ❤ 
This was just beyond cute. Ugh !!
It's always nice to know that the u/dickfromaccounting has a soft spot in his heart. 
Well aint that fuckin precious 
That shy little walk over. I didn't realize that I miss that now my kids are older. 
Feelsgoodman
A man who has to deal with people he isn't sure will turn and immediately try to kill him finds himself in a situation where someone just wants to give him a hug. That's must have made his day.
Would've made that officer's day too. Probably went home and told his wife how awesome of a day it was. 
I know it's a repost... But my dad was a cop for a very long time. This tugs my heart seeing a child seeing a cop as a person... Someone trying to keep them and everyone around them safe and happy...

I am saddened by the law enforcement that take advantage negatively of their place in society.
HUG THE POLICE COMIN STRAIGHT FROM THE UNDERGROUND
I remember when I felt this way about the police. Now they scare the shit out of me.
Probably just made that cop's week!

Cops have to deal with a lot of really crappy humans, and one of *these* can reset a ton of "man, I've had enough of the whole bloody lot of you!"
ACAB
I try to think this is natural, but the child looking back at the camera is odd...


Kids generally aren’t aware of social awkwardness. As we get older we tend to lose the ability to even say hi to new people. Shame really. 
My son actually took it to the next level. We were at a restaurant, he was playing with a toy gun. When the police came in for lunch, he approached them and after exchanging pleasantries he asked if one of the officers would switch with him for the guns... It was quite funny to see a ploliceman speechless for a sec 😊
>He's reaching for my gun!!!
<3 the police force. I know a lot of people dislike them claiming they give the government to much power, but they do so much for us and people don't even realize. I just wish they were allowed to treat minorites and majorities equally. Giving someone a pass for being part of a minority is actual discrimination and it's not right to make the police participate in that in order to not 'hurt someone's feelings.'
what would happen if racial swap between the two?
Jesus let the man eat in peace. 
To the kid it's like meeting a real life super hero. 
This is amazing. Show some love to our boys in blue!
I just want a hug squire
That police officer is a giant. 
*... Aaaaaand back to mommy* :D
I want to be apart of something that real. :(
r/wholesome
adorable!!
This gif is beautiful.
I want to be a policeman now. 
i remember reading an article about a security check at a cricket match in Australia. it talked about this guard miming to a kid to lift his arms to be checked - and the kid ran in for a hug.

the guard tried again, and the kid hugged again.

would have loved to see a video of that.
Omg my heart is melting this is so adorable!
Taser taser taser
That's not a boy, that's a little person and he just stole that man's jewelry.
I like how he checks with the camera person before he goes in for the hug.
We need more humans being bros. We would all benefit when people are less cunty. 
I'm not crying you're fucking crying fuck off
This is the good shit in life.

That's it for me tonight.

Goodnight everybody.
Lol
Damn the feels 
Osm
There is hope for the future, we need more of this. 
More like forced. 
This looks more like a "do I have to mom?" Kind of moment. If the kid wanted to, he would ask the officer before having the person even have their phone out recording.
Cutest shit I've seen all week

This warms my cold, cynical heart. :)
Damn, that is adorable as hell!
Awwwwwe, Awesome 
Where can I listen to the audio for this? I'm sure it's just as adorable.
Could use more of this, applied everywhere.
What a peaceful moment.
"and on that day, little tommy stole his first police officer's pistol"...
"Go fucking hug him!"😂😂
Very cute kids.
Need more of this in humanity people!! In grown adults too!
It's funny...

As children we're told to always reach out to the police if something goes wrong, and yet, as adults we're trained to keep our mouths shut until our lawyer arrives. 
r/mademesmile
Er, kinda like this. https://youtu.be/4Kf4kyQabwQ
666th to comment, nice
It's ok that you don't use proper grammar. 
I always wonder how people know to start recording before moments like these happen. Like what if he went over there and kicked the cop in the shin? What if he just had to go to the bathroom? How do people know when a little boy is going to randomly hug an officer?! I have many questions.
The best part is how he turns and runs back so quickly right after hugging him. 
“Police officer just wants to eat his lunch.”
So many Europeans probably thought the cop would shoot the kid 
there's lots of love in the world!!! :)

I tried this and got tazed
Aww
!PNGBot
So I was at this restaurant with my girlfriend this one time. We were just sitting there eating some chips and salsa, just ready to order our food. This sweet old lady approaches our row of tables. She's going down the line to each booth offering free hugs to everyone. When she finally approached us, she said, "awwww, how is the  date going for these cute couple?" We both really had a bad day going in before hand and just really wanted something to eat. Anyway, we both blushed and smiled for once and she offered us a hug. So we decided to hug and say thanks then she went on her way. It lit up our days and just exactly what we needed.

The sweet old lady hugged us again after we paid our check and left. She really was the coolest lady ever.

Edit: a word
So cute! 
Oh my god and how he starts to run away in  excitement afterwards.

I have a little boy and this melts my heart. I love kids, they are so pure and kind. (Most of them...)
!PNGBot
This looks identical to the one I worked at..
And he runs away
he is like a little walking napkin..
All kids love Call of Duty: Black Cops
So adorable
"Hey Timmy, go ask that policeman for a hug so that mommy can take a video!"

"But mooooooooom!"

"Do it or you get no dessert. Mommy needs her Karma"
Wholesome
Sad that as adults we’ll never have the innocence of a child again. 
At the point when my neighbors moved in such huge numbers of years prior and their little girl was perhaps 3 years of age, she yelled at me "I cherish you" when she was in the yard with her mother and I was strolling to my front entryway.
Imagine the blowback though, if that little boy were Garrison Keillor.  
ACAB little Timmy

Oh the feelings..... not going to lie I’m teary
I think that children see things that we forget to look at as adults. 
That is Semi from the comedy flick Employee of the Month (dane cook, harland williams, andy dick)


Cop seems like a very jolly dude.
Sweet
Am I feeling feelings? 
aww
Made both of their days..
that is very chweeet...
*Awwwww*
I can’t get over this! <3
I don't remember the first time I saw this, but it would be funny if this kid were old enough to be on reddit now.
What an odd seating arrangement.  
Good cop:good cop
r/wholesomegifs
Smart guy!
So cute
Less child worship, more puppies! 
Watch out, the cop will probably see the child flinch, draw his firearm and kill everyone in the place...in self defense of course. 
Or he wants to touch a black man.
I'm too high for these feels.
Could the whole world not be like that? please!
Nice to see cops get some love
Awww, I love the way he walks over. What a sweet little boy. 
Heart melter 5000!

He's the cop from dawn of the dead!
Oh is that what we are doing tonight? We’re crying?
I used to be that kid up until the world made into the cynical individual that I am today. I wish life was easier.
Good thing he doesn't have any skittles
We BLACK PEOPLE are NOT deceived by such ‘shows’...
No, I'm not crying... its...uh...its sweat

Hug 'da police!
Frick the police huh?
Wait a minute, where is my gun? Oh you little shie
STOP RESISTING
This is the first r/awww post that actually made me say "awww" out loud.
Awww...!! He's so giddy after his hug ^__^

Shame
Wtf I think that's my dad
I'm not crying, you're crying!
That must’ve been a little light in the darkness of what I can imagine is a fairly tough job. 
Repost.
It’s the smallest of gestures  that Can can give you such an uplift.
Ballsy ass kid. I can't even raise my hand in class to ask a question.  
I wish we could all keep that kind of mentality.
This is the sort of thing that makes drunk-me want to have kids.

(Sober-me is a bit more pragmatic unfortunately.)
Aww this made my day
wana hug this lil baby
Awwwwwww

Thats so cute. If i was that officer, that would have made my year.

Aww.. I love that little happy dash on back to his parents. Any who I bet it made that man's day. 
Hero’s are amazing. Need more of this. 
Fantastic! I want to hug that cop too. 
I always wanted to hug carl Winslow myself.
If they review his bodycam he gets investigated for inappropriate behaviour
Truely blessed. Now I want to be a cop even more 
I am going to concert
This is just adorable.  
He actually stole his gun.
Hah, maybe he wants to grow up to be a police officer too. 
"Hey, go hug that cop!  I have to reap this sweet reddit karma!"
This used to be me. Before i became an expert at hiding my emotions and society destroyed my self-esteem.

Peace to you little man. Stay true to yourself, and thanks for making my day!
For me, cops were like clowns; they always freaked me out. They had guns, thought they had some kind of right to tell me what to do or shoot me or send me to gaol. It's scary. And still, I find it hard to drive naturally or stand naturally or even not feel guilty if a cop is visible. 
Yo son.. I need that sweet internet karma. Go over and hug that policeman while I record.
Mom made him do it.
Very sweet
Soo cute :D
Is that a flaccid penis on the wall!? 
Later on after they made sure that the video was posted in r/awww and the maximum amount of good PR was achieved, they sent the child's parents into FEMA camp and they arrested the child for assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and fleeing from the crime scene. Happy jail time kiddo. /s
Try that in ten years
Hugged many download cops

They’re the best cops
He's planted some weed, hasn't he?
no,mom told him to do it so she can post it on reddit and boost her ego Xd
That child should be arrested for assaulting an officer.
That is awesome! 
HES A BOMB
😭😭😭😭
So innocent
Little OP just wants some karma off a repost. 
OP just wants karma so reposts old shit
Heartwarming
That little kid just made that cop's day :-)
Remember when this happened like a year ago and was all over the internet
Mah heart mah sole
My heart has melted c':
This is so fucking cute
Aww
That's the cutest thing. 
Lotsa positive vibes in this clip.
Is that Carl Winslow???
I'm melting! :')
And now I am crying. 
Kid has great slight of hand, anyone else see him steal that McNugget?
What's with the legs on the wall
Post it on r/maddmesmile
Jesus. H. Christ. Who in hell is cutting the friggin onions in here? 
Is that Ron Coleman?
I'm feeling happier now!
Hug the police, coming straight from the play ground 
this cute af!
Will you violently ensure my place in the social hierarchy when I grow up?
I wish this was the norm instead of an outlier.  I hate how mean the world is today.
Aww that’s adorable. 
My husband is a cop. Whenever my two year old son would see a cop in uniform, he'd think it was his daddy and call after him. It was pretty funny. Short, tall, white, black, they were all his daddy.
Ok, who's this Dickfromaccounting guy and why is he always on the front page???
I can't.
missed Titel of the year: "hug teh police"
In Cuba kids always always ask the cops : "policeman, would you like to be my friend?"

Damn that dude arm was as big as the kid! Big bear the cop!
That is adorable.

Hi
Oh man, that feels good 
Nice repost
I love this 
Watch out he's got a gun oh shit and a nuke shoot to kill!
Is that Ron Coleman?
Hug the police coming straight from the underground ,

A young boy wants its hug and its burger crown,

And not the other MCD so police think

They have the authority to resist the love...

Where is the love ? Where is the love, the love, the love ...

What's wrong with the world ,mama

People living like police ain't got no mamas

I think the whole world is addicted to fast food and drama,

Only attracted to things that'll bring your obesity, increased heart rate, diabetes, heart problems and trauma.

Overweight, yeah we try to stop heroism,

Meanwhile we got heros livin here,
In the USA, the big USCP,

The protection and safety they want to be. Yeah   
this made my dark sunday afternoon a lot better.
I wish the world was as pure as this lil child!
<3
This makes me wanna hug a police too
Little boy looks like he was coached lol
