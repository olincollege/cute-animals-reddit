Nooooooooo! I was there in 2010. I narrowly missed it by 9 years (‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª)

edit: I can't believe this innocent post got so many upvotes! Thanks for all the nice answers and the reddit silver! Very appreciated!
I need 7

Are they plushies or pillows? Yes.
[Here is where](https://aitaikuji.com/you-more-round-squishy-seal-awake) you can get this squishy boy. There is another website that has them for a touch cheaper but I think they only ship inside Japan. 

FYI,  shipping will be $$$. The seal is $70, my estimated shipping cost was $65 to USA.

Edit: Not a shill. I just like squishy seals.
I thought these were real seals at first and I was shook
For years I have been thinking that a blob seal plushie would be super cute, and now someone has actually made em.
"How do we make a seal plushie everyone wants to buy?"  
  
"We don't.  We make a Spheal plushie everyone wants to buy.  Then we make 10 different colors so they have to catch 'em all."
I was just there last week on vacation! Their gift shop is brimming with cute things.

[EDIT: I just found this picture I took of one of their seals looking down at me through a porthole.](http://imgur.com/gallery/zWGrcUo) Looks like the pillow is an accurate portrait!
Okay I'm not the type of person to say /r/INEEEEDIT for every item I see.

But this. This I can get behind
take my money!
Japanese people are so good at figuring out what our brains interpret as "cute." Really pushing the boundaries here.
I'll take your entire stock
Omg. Throw it at people you disapprove of. 
Seal of Disapproval
Edit: Wow! My first gold!!! Thank you kind stranger <3
The Osaka aquarium is amazing. Highly recommended for anyone in the area. I've just realized that I need to go back.

I didn't know I needed one of these.

It looks like you‚Äôll have to speak Japanese or use a third-party to buy https://www.felissimo.co.jp/youmore/gcd177877/

They also back ordered until end of November possibly
Imagine cuddling one of these at night! My body needs!
P.S. You can pre-order them here, it seems: https://aitaikuji.com/you-more-round-squishy-seal-awake
Omg now I want a squishy pillow of the manatee who smooshes his face into the glass. I laugh uncontrollably every time I see that video, it's my favorite.

WOO SQUISHY BOIS!
I work in marine conservation and 100% thought that was a real seal.
I am ashamed.
this gives me anxiety because I'm going to Japan soon and I need more luggage space for all the SQUISHY SEALS
I'm going to Osaka in November. My yen is ready.
!remindme 6 years
I need it
Well...my husband has been pushing for a vacation there. I guess we have to go now.
For reference, here is a photo of one of the seals at the Osaka aquarium. I laughed my ass off at these dudes. https://imgur.com/dABoQ1P.jpg
I NEED THE BLUBBER EGG
Is the one on the left actually real or am I blind
There amazing I thought they were actual seals for a second before I read the title
Weird. My adblocker let this one through...
I wait for the giant wind up that slaps its belly.
I wanna buy my GF one of these anyone know if I can get one online
And then you can get some seal sushi at the food court.
Left one is so done with Karens shit.
I hate when y'all post these but not the link to buy

How much are they
Dibs on the right one
Holy crap this would go perfect with my recent plush purchase 

https://discountpetdeals.com/products/new-york-yankees-plush-baseball-bat-toy
Spheal.
I want one ... No i NEED one
Thought these were real seals lmaooo
Do they have any dolphin or whale plushies? Maybe with embedded harpoon accessories?
I need one.

I teach statistics, and the book that I use has several problems in the correlation section attempting to correlate the overhead width of a seal to its weight.  I refer to it as the fat seal problem.  I would probably embarrass myself by bringing a big fat seal to class, but I need a fat seal. They look enough like pillows that I feel like I could leave one of my living room.

I‚Äôm trying to decide if I need $27 worth:
Eyes closed is so peaceful but eyes open has a certain air of judgement that I just love
Perfect couch pillows
Can I order one?????
I WANT ONE NOW!
Is there any way you could buy these online? It would be great to snuggle with in the winter
Kuchi Buchi
Do they ship internationally
It's so obvious that I've always needed this
Okay this is just playing dirty at this point. Way below the belt.

I'll take 80.
No it didnt cause I'm on my way to buy the whole stock.
Oh lawd, he comin
Never heard the word plushie before and I like it. I like the plushies they look soft
They get my seal of approval
I'm still so upset that when I went 2 years ago that their sea otter exhibit was closed T\_T;
My god I thought that was real for a second.
Physics memes be like
I want all of them, and create a terra cotta-like army in my house.
Are they fat seal  or just big eggs
The sad part is that the don‚Äôt have online store :((
I wonder if it's possible to buy these online.
t h i c c b o i
Where can I get his online
I got one for Christmas :3
*WANT. NOW.*
I was there in July and they had a spin the wheel game to win a free plush toy and my girlfriend won one. Happiest I've seen her lmao
DO THEY HAVE AN ONLINE GIFT SHOP?!
stonks ‚àÜ
Where the hell is Osaka?

Edit: I used the word hell trying to convey how excited I would be to learn where I can get one of those cute plushies.

I type how I talk and I can see how that can be misinterpreted
Do they sell them with plush clubs?
While killing hundreds of whales and dolphins! Fuck Japan. I can‚Äôt believe this thread. You cowards
First stop on my future Japan trip :D
I want ten!

IT'S SPHEREICAL
Not to out myself as a lazy slob but these look like perfect nap cushions.
is there somewhere these can be purchased online? asking for a friend.

Pop it.
In the west I never buy random tat. In Japan I wanted all the things.
*Sneezes*
I swear I'll visit just to get one of those.
That aquarium was amazing. The exhibit for the seal was awesome too. that seal was so friendly and cute and it was just as fat as these plushies. It would wiggle its way up to you and study you. When it was wiggling up it was like this round ball or fur and fluff with a small head bouncing in and out. 

hilarious.
I feel like those would be in our house if they'd had them when me and my girlfriend went last year.

I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if one of them is real, or if both of them are stuffed toys.
That is friggin adorable.
It‚Äôs available on this website, which I think looks more legit than the ikiha site posted earlier: https://www.felissimo.co.jp/int/wk59146/?m=top_dbn&c=top_dbn_190906_yukiarale.  (At least I hope it‚Äôs legit‚Äîjust ordered one of each!)
I still wouldn't visit the place.
They have these at Edinburgh zoo.
I got my niece a fat penguin one. I love it
Oh snap. My niece would love this thing.

Osaka aquarium has an AMAZING gift shop! They had plushies of pretty much everything, even 'non' cute sea animals lol
Osaka, your gift shop game good, but you really need to work on yo presentation
Japan has all the cool things!  I mean, even their [capsule toys are supreme!](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1Og6lXLWG3KVjSZPcq6zkbXXaf/Japanese-Original-Capsule-sleeping-zoo-animal-collection-4-Shiba-Inu-Hippo-black-cat-kangaroo-Bengal-tiger.jpg)

Are they holding the plushie next to a real fat seal or are they both plushues?
This is the only thing I want in life.
Now the main question for me is how is it possible to get this toy while living in Prague??? :/
Must.... have.....
If you remove the face it literally looks like the moon

Is there anywhere to buy the realistic seal plushie on the left? I can't seem to find it online
