I just feel so bad for owls. Imagine not being able to take a sneak peak at a thing without rotating your entire head in the process. 

With owls? There is no such thing as subtlety.
Dave what the fuck is that?

I'm a radio!

A Radio!?

Yes! Hold on, I think I can get FM!

You're an idiot, Dave.
Man, they're super expressive. Never seen a bird show facial expressions

He‚Äôs just trying to get good reception with his antenna
They looked genuinely concerned for Dave. Good owl buddies.
When Dave walked up,

And waved it high 

But it broke

Someone needs to do a voiceover for this. It would be a shame not to.
It looks like Dave is holding the stick when he turns, cuteness overload achieved.
Dave has antenna and he knows it.

No they should check out my stick.
Dave‚Äôs too cool to look for their inevitable reactions.
Hey, Dave, are you the new branch manager? Cool!

Guys, that‚Äôs a radio antenna... that drone was transferring a signal and forgot to retract the antenna. The other drones are looking in sheer horror as they noticed that truth being exposed!
Nice woody

Burrowing owls are normally a terrestrial species; Dave chose to be areal.
Owl took Teddy Roosevelt's words to heart.

Five little owls in an old elm- tree, fluffy and puffy as owls could be. Blinking and winking with big round eyes At the big round moon that hung in the skies. As I passed beneath I could hear one say, "There'll be mouse for supper, there will, today" . Then all of them hooted,  "Tu whit, Tu woo; yes, mouse for supper, hoo hoo, hoo hoo"

Here we have an Owl Emergency Unit (OEU) comprised of Dave (left), Frank (middle), and John (right).

Obviously Dave is the units radio man, but Frank does not seem to understand why Dave insists on having such a large antenna. Frank keeps trying to tell Dave that they can get by with a smaller antenna but Dave just disagrees with him and ignores Franks protest.

John, while amazed at the size of Daves antenna, really does not give a crap about what Dave carries as long as it works and just wants to get on with the mission.
Burrowing owls are so damn cute!
Damn Dave

Its like when you only have one clean shirt and its really stupid or you got a weird haircut and you just try to walk into work and pretend nothings  different like "hey guys...." whioe people just stare and wonder whether or not to ask you about it
The other birds were worried because he forgot to hide his antenna while being captured on camera and now the whole world knows that birds aren't real.

oh damn Harold got himself caught by them humans again. Now they gonna be tracking us all the freaking day!
this needs a dub sooooo bad lol. i can only imagine
I like the way Dave avoids eye contact with admirers
Dave is always ahead of the game when it comes to the newest bird trends.
Dave: winks at camera  
Jim: "is that a stick?"

\*sneezes\*

Jim: "damnit guys i'm allergic to sticks..."

Chester: "stick?"
Nice
He's got the radio.
The bird equivalent of the black obelisk in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  The two right hand dudes are just as awestruck.
‚Äúhow can he afford a stick like that i‚Äôve seen the nest he lives in!‚Äù
Reminds me of happyfeet
Looks like he has a radio on his back lol
r/youseeingthisshit
Anyone else read this in an Australian accent?
I commented this owl has an antenna. My wife without skipping a beat. ‚Äú the birds work for the bourgeois ‚Äú
I have returned, BEHOLD

‚ÄúLook at the stick! Doooon‚Äôt look at the stick!‚Äù
Aw man it's Dave again, Hi Dave!

That's just a government drone.

#birdsarentreal
Dave looks like the mother of the other two.
Middle dude like ‚Äúbruh tha- that stick tho- wha‚Äù
Thank you for this.
u/vredditdownloader
Older model of government drone, the antenna is too obvious
Dave's wearing a wire.
That's an antenna.
BIRDS ARENT REAL
1st graders be like
‚ÄúI mean, should we tell him?‚Äù
Perfect caption.
Is no one wondering why he has a stick there?! And worried it might be jammed into his side or something?
Acting like he doesn‚Äôt even care or notice he‚Äôs wearing a stick
‚ÄúSend in... the drone‚Äù
Bitches love sticks
The guy in the middle is shaking his head expecting to wake up from this dream
He's the radio man leave him be
I know this is a funny pc, but please let me know if the owl is OK, and the stick is not stabbing / piercing it in any way. ?
Ok, let me get this straight. I fly under that power line at 88 miles an hour, and you do what, again?
Isn‚Äôt this a repost from like... 2 years ago?
Dave‚Äôs so cool, wish I could get a stick too.
Repost
Looks like Jim a Hensen skit.

"the fuck is this"  


"the fuck is that"
Dave is OBVIOUSLY the adventurer!
Totally not wearing a wire.

I call shenanigans on these upvotes. 100k in ~8 hours for something that‚Äôs been posted here dozens of times?
I never get tired of this one
Blathers is going to go fish
It‚Äôs an antenna because r/birdsarentreal
It's the JTAC.
Middle one seems a bit salty at the end. Definitely some stick-envy going on there.
He's just pretending like it isn't there too.
Stick envy
The drones are being made cheaper and cheaper.
Why is there no sound?!
The wink right when he comes up though ;)
‚ÄúCorporal?!  Get me the RTO-wait!  As you were! Here‚Äôs Pvt. Snuffy now.‚Äù
They look so mind blown by that stick.
Upvote for the caption
Thet bird has more friends than me because of that stick
This has the most upvotes I‚Äôve ever seen.
Does anyone else remember Eskimo Bob? This clip just brought me right back to the 90s.
["Where'd you get those kick ass pipes?"](https://youtu.be/qbjz0ukvLRc)
Love how Dave nonchalantly looks away while flexing his stick.
He‚Äôs a comm guy. That‚Äôs not a stick, it‚Äôs his antenna. And what an antenna it is :)
The bird in the middle just got an idea of a lifetime and I don‚Äôt like it
I thought this was some hot owl furry porn
Damn nice stick bro

Me when my brother finds a cool stick
Dave's just like "oh what's up guys, dont mind me with my huge stick"
http://imgur.com/a/2VWs9sa

It's not mine but I hope you enjoy.
It reminds me of Penguins of Madagascar for some reason.
An antenna to hijack predators coms im guessing, Dave's going behind enemy line!
"My stick, my stick, my stick is better than bacooonnnnnn"

*‚ÄìYoda*
That ain't no stick, that is an antena. That ain't no bird but a ro-bird.
I like how Dave doesn't care. He's just like "sup, losers" looks away
I want a Tony Baker voiceover!
That's big pp
Can somebody produce a 8 season tv show with these three dudes please?
Cuties....
I was in a bad mood, then I saw this. Thank you Dave
This is a call to arms! We fly at dusk!
How the fuck did a repost get over 110k upvotes? Omg.
Too cute!
This is the 5th time I've seen this post from r/aww on my front page.
What kind of animals are these?
I recognize a wizard when I see one
This looks like something straight out of a Pixar movie lol!
"Hi I' m Dave. John's gone ..."
"My stick, my stick, my stiick is better than bacooooooon"

"hahahahaa you can't have my stick"

"hahahaaaa yeah you want my stick"
This is owl squad, come in eagle squad. We are in position.
u/vredditdownloader
The one on the right looked towards the stick immediately. There are only 2 options:

1-the middle owl told him

2-their necks are faster than the cameras fps
I will never not love this.
I agree
Oh I remember seeing this before.

Didn't someone paint this?
Guys, guys, I get my worms on peck at a time just like you
It's funny because my name is Dave and my friend somehow linked me with owls - so basically this confirms their theory. I'm Dave the owl.
SHOW ME MORE OF DAVE
u/Mr_mould
OzzyMan's voice in my mind...
DAVE! DAVE!
Man, I love these creative, yet simple, titles, I don't know how you people come up with them but I love them, and this is hilarious.
You‚Äôre a wizard , Owl
I've got a similar sized stick
Wow, nice stick bro.
two l√ºtt owls are watching the environment one is looking "gen" west or north, the pther in the very iopposite direction: to my mind they together are kinda bipolar, there would be missing two more accomplishing ones watching the rest of the entire environment.....
additionally there is a third one in the background watchin the other¬¥s from the "outside". Hope he doesn¬¥t feel lonely; sure the other¬¥s take care of him as well!!!!#

&#x200B;

No one should be left behind, as far as I think at least
That‚Äôs a big stick!
That‚Äôs wat she said

Hoot softly and carry a big stick-ancient owl proverb

Well, you know what they say about owls with big sticks...
DAVE'S NOT HERE! ~Cheech & Chong
This needs to be dubbed
Absolute unit!!!!!!!
Dave is an RTO and there is a high chance of snipers in the area. Dave just decided to chill out next to the new LT and PSG.
üòÇ
Woah Dave has a cool stick
I have seen this post a thousand times on what seems like every single sub and that‚Äôs fine but the fact that it has 125k upvotes...
Half expecting Dave to say "Roger that"
Daww, always knew Dave had a long one.

Clearly that is an antenna. Yet another malfunctioning government drone. r/birdsarentreal

Acoustic Kitty has failed, now it is time for Hedwig FM.
