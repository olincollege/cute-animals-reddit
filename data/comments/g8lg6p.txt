Bird in the middle just couldnt comprehend the sheer size of Dave's stick.

I was kind of hoping it would cut to them all having sticks.

That’s just his radio control antenna. /r/BirdsArentReal
I don’t care how many times this gets reposted. I’ll always laugh at the other 2 owls reactions
/r/youseeingthisstick
I just feel so bad for owls. Imagine not being able to take a sneak peak at a thing without rotating your entire head in the process. 

With owls? There is no such thing as subtlety.
Dave what the fuck is that?

I'm a radio!

A Radio!?

Yes! Hold on, I think I can get FM!

You're an idiot, Dave.
Man, they're super expressive. Never seen a bird show facial expressions
[deleted]
When you trying a new risky style and act casual af like nothings changed
...hey, Dave...um, do you know that you

...i don't know what to say -

'*to Who?*'

well, You, Dave - i guess you don't know

it's really TALL... did it just grow?!

'*c'mon, fren - whatchu talking 'bout ?*'

'*just Tell me - you can get it out !*'

...well, see, it's just the Oddest thing,

Dave winked at me
Dave’s uses it to keep the others in line.
That middle birds just like "Man, I gotta get me one of them sticks."
Makes me laugh every time I see it😂
The middle one seems to have a hard time believing it.
Someone HAS to have had made this into /r/AnimalTextGifs 

Right?
*Zefrank voice* "No Terence that is clearly not a stick. I'm pretty sure Dave is a spy. Look at that antenna!"
Is this the Southpark bus stop?
He’s just trying to get good reception with his antenna
They looked genuinely concerned for Dave. Good owl buddies.
When Dave walked up,

Stick a-blazing 

All the owls 

Where a-gazing.

He said “Look here!”

And waved it high 

But it broke

Up in the sky.

Right  owl “Thats a nice stick bro” 

Dave “thanks bro”

Middle owl “it’s okay I mean I could have found that if I wanted to”
Little did they know it is an owl spy camera.
Bitches love sticks
Middle bird: Dave where'd you get that stick? 

Dave: what stick?

Right bird: wowowow! 

Middle bird: I'd like a stick like that too!
I love what u/LeopARTnik did with this video.

[We salute you!](https://youtu.be/YUCYXf4CGxE?t=60)
Caption is absolute perfection.
They're so weird. Why did 2 of them stare right at the camera?  They know stuff.
I just love how "dave" just looks away like be doesnt even know how hard he's flexing on em xD
Dave's definitely their comms guy.
Oh crap it's the commander
He’s got an antenna for contacting the overlords
The one in the middle had to shake off the illusion it was anything to worry about. You see him reset
Telecominications tower
What?

Am I crazy?  You seeing this?

Bro got a muthafuckin antenna!

He's remote controlled!

Look at him go!

That's Dave's stick back the fuck off
Do the best comments on these reports change?

He looks like he’s about to call in air support
Dave just acting like it no big deal
“Wowz such amaze of stick” 👀 👀
The middle one at the end *looks at the camera*: "You see this shit, right?"
Nah fam that’s the same antenna they used on mumble in happy feet. It’s the aliens stick!

Dave: That's right

Why is everyone looking at my stick?
Someone needs to do a voiceover for this. It would be a shame not to.
It looks like Dave is holding the stick when he turns, cuteness overload achieved.
Dave has antenna and he knows it.
stick owl looks like the "Private" of those owls (owls of madagascar)
No they should check out my stick.
Dave’s too cool to look for their inevitable reactions.
Hey, Dave, are you the new branch manager? Cool!
“Oh this old thing?”
*I fucking love owls*
Guys, that’s a radio antenna... that drone was transferring a signal and forgot to retract the antenna. The other drones are looking in sheer horror as they noticed that truth being exposed!
Nice woody
The one in the middle looked like "fuckin showoff" at the end
Happy feet 3
thats a nice stick!
Burrowing owls are normally a terrestrial species; Dave chose to be areal.
Owl took Teddy Roosevelt's words to heart.

"Speak softly and carry a big stick"
Is that a 5G antenna? So it was their plan to exterminate humans all along!
“Nice rod bro”
Nice Stick Bro
Five little owls in an old elm- tree, fluffy and puffy as owls could be. Blinking and winking with big round eyes At the big round moon that hung in the skies. As I passed beneath I could hear one say, "There'll be mouse for supper, there will, today" . Then all of them hooted,  "Tu whit, Tu woo; yes, mouse for supper, hoo hoo, hoo hoo"

I hope it wasn’t stabbed by the stick.
Dave just swoops in, gives the camera a wink and then nonchalantly looks away while the chicks check out his stick in awe.. what a chad.

Dave: "it's a Com Intel Recon Antenna." 
Teamates: "Whiskey Tango Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo?"
“Oh this old thing? Yeah, just something I had (f)lying around.”
“Oh this ole thing?”

He’s Lowkey trying to flex he ain’t slick.
I’m sorry 



Whoa, check out Dave’s dick
They both said: WTF’s that thing.
Just because you wouldn’t stick around long

Guys don't be fooled, this is an antenna for receiving commands from the government.
Idk, this is a bit farfetch’d.

The owl on the right looking incredibly confused and thinking "I thought Dave was a girl."
Notice how the owl gives a lil wink at the camera when he pulls up with the stick

Ayy, Sirfetched my guy, how's it going? Lost your shield?
Anybody know what birds they are?
Makes me think of that scene from Happy Feet when he returns, “say, how does that feet thing go again?”
That's like Cartman pulling in with the new Trapper Keeper.
You like Dave's stick? you gay owl!
Looks like a sce'e from the office, the direct look at the camera at the end
I love the double and triple looks from his buds. 

Bud 1: what the? Dave wtf is that?

Bud2: seriously. Wtf is that??

Bud 1: hey man. We being watched.

Someone add some text to this gif!
Here we have an Owl Emergency Unit (OEU) comprised of Dave (left), Frank (middle), and John (right).

Obviously Dave is the units radio man, but Frank does not seem to understand why Dave insists on having such a large antenna. Frank keeps trying to tell Dave that they can get by with a smaller antenna but Dave just disagrees with him and ignores Franks protest.

John, while amazed at the size of Daves antenna, really does not give a crap about what Dave carries as long as it works and just wants to get on with the mission.
Burrowing owls are so damn cute!
Damn Dave
He's the comms owl
Dave had a rough day.
Twig Owlstein, father of the worm spear.
The bird in the middle is so utterly confused on why Dave isn't in the hospital rn taking care of that impaled stick
"Sup guys *stretches* oh this? Oh it's nothing. Pretty cool tho, right?
This is an older, remote controlled, model of bird..

Do not try and bend the stick, that's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth...there is no stick. Then you'll see that it is not the stick that bends, it is only yourself.
Check out my stick, guys!!
hey hey now don't show me on camera

We need Snoop and Sir Attenborough to do the voices now.
The video wouldn’t load and I was so confused by the title
I can imagine all the birds with a surfer dude voice and bird no. 1 is like "woah dude, look at his sick stick" and bird no. 2 says "oh yeaaa, that's a gnarly stick bro" and the bird with this stick is dying of that feeling when someone who you don expect to complement you complements you.
That's a spy.
"Dave, you've got something in your --"

"My what?"

"It's a --"

"Shh, don't tell him. See how long 'til he notices."
Random fact of the day. A group of owls is known as a parliament.
It's always about size......
Looked more like "Fuck man, that had to hurt!"
The owl lady at the owl hotel told me that owls have binocular vision and owls can’t see close up objects. That owl’s stick is so impressive to these owls that now the owls can see the stick.
What, this old thing? I only cary it when I don’t care what kind of stick I’m carrying.

Its like when you only have one clean shirt and its really stupid or you got a weird haircut and you just try to walk into work and pretend nothings  different like "hey guys...." whioe people just stare and wonder whether or not to ask you about it
The other birds were worried because he forgot to hide his antenna while being captured on camera and now the whole world knows that birds aren't real.

How Dave turns his head away to nonchalantly show his stick off reminds me of Dueling Hats from Key and Peele.

Does the stick serve a purpose other than making other bitches jealous?
Is that all you got?

Older model of government drone, the antenna is too obvious
Dave's wearing a wire.
That's an antenna.
BIRDS ARENT REAL
1st graders be like
“I mean, should we tell him?”
Perfect caption.
Is no one wondering why he has a stick there?! And worried it might be jammed into his side or something?
Acting like he doesn’t even care or notice he’s wearing a stick
“Send in... the drone”
Bitches love sticks
The guy in the middle is shaking his head expecting to wake up from this dream
He's the radio man leave him be
I know this is a funny pc, but please let me know if the owl is OK, and the stick is not stabbing / piercing it in any way. ?
Ok, let me get this straight. I fly under that power line at 88 miles an hour, and you do what, again?
Isn’t this a repost from like... 2 years ago?
Dave’s so cool, wish I could get a stick too.
Repost
Looks like Jim a Hensen skit.
yo Dave hide your antenna the humans are here
"the fuck is this"  


"the fuck is that"
Dave is OBVIOUSLY the adventurer!
Totally not wearing a wire.
I-
I call shenanigans on these upvotes. 100k in ~8 hours for something that’s been posted here dozens of times?
I never get tired of this one
Blathers is going to go fish
It’s an antenna because r/birdsarentreal
It's the JTAC.
Middle one seems a bit salty at the end. Definitely some stick-envy going on there.
He's just pretending like it isn't there too.
Stick envy
The drones are being made cheaper and cheaper.
Why is there no sound?!
The wink right when he comes up though ;)
“Corporal?!  Get me the RTO-wait!  As you were! Here’s Pvt. Snuffy now.”
They look so mind blown by that stick.
Upvote for the caption
Thet bird has more friends than me because of that stick
This has the most upvotes I’ve ever seen.
Does anyone else remember Eskimo Bob? This clip just brought me right back to the 90s.

Love how Dave nonchalantly looks away while flexing his stick.
He’s a comm guy. That’s not a stick, it’s his antenna. And what an antenna it is :)
The bird in the middle just got an idea of a lifetime and I don’t like it
I thought this was some hot owl furry porn
Damn nice stick bro

Me when my brother finds a cool stick
Dave's just like "oh what's up guys, dont mind me with my huge stick"

It's not mine but I hope you enjoy.
It reminds me of Penguins of Madagascar for some reason.
An antenna to hijack predators coms im guessing, Dave's going behind enemy line!
"My stick, my stick, my stick is better than bacooonnnnnn"

*–Yoda*
That ain't no stick, that is an antena. That ain't no bird but a ro-bird.
I like how Dave doesn't care. He's just like "sup, losers" looks away
I want a Tony Baker voiceover!
That's big pp
Can somebody produce a 8 season tv show with these three dudes please?
Cuties....
I was in a bad mood, then I saw this. Thank you Dave
This is a call to arms! We fly at dusk!
How the fuck did a repost get over 110k upvotes? Omg.
Too cute!
This is the 5th time I've seen this post from r/aww on my front page.
What kind of animals are these?
I recognize a wizard when I see one
This looks like something straight out of a Pixar movie lol!
"Hi I' m Dave. John's gone ..."
"My stick, my stick, my stiick is better than bacooooooon"

"hahahahaa you can't have my stick"

"hahahaaaa yeah you want my stick"
This is owl squad, come in eagle squad. We are in position.

The one on the right looked towards the stick immediately. There are only 2 options:

1-the middle owl told him

2-their necks are faster than the cameras fps
I will never not love this.
I agree
Oh I remember seeing this before.

Didn't someone paint this?
Guys, guys, I get my worms on peck at a time just like you
It's funny because my name is Dave and my friend somehow linked me with owls - so basically this confirms their theory. I'm Dave the owl.
SHOW ME MORE OF DAVE
u/Mr_mould
OzzyMan's voice in my mind...
DAVE! DAVE!
Man, I love these creative, yet simple, titles, I don't know how you people come up with them but I love them, and this is hilarious.
You’re a wizard , Owl
I've got a similar sized stick
Wow, nice stick bro.
two lütt owls are watching the environment one is looking "gen" west or north, the pther in the very iopposite direction: to my mind they together are kinda bipolar, there would be missing two more accomplishing ones watching the rest of the entire environment.....
additionally there is a third one in the background watchin the other´s from the "outside". Hope he doesn´t feel lonely; sure the other´s take care of him as well!!!!#

&#x200B;

No one should be left behind, as far as I think at least
That’s a big stick!
That’s wat she said
How he get sticc tho?
Hoot softly and carry a big stick-ancient owl proverb
[is that Dave? you sure is not Alan?](https://youtu.be/XgvR3y5JCXg)

You’d never guess which one is the robot. The antenna is so cleverly hidden!

The confusion is real
I could watch this a thousand times a day and still giggle at it.
Whoa what a wonderful stick

Well, you know what they say about owls with big sticks...
DAVE'S NOT HERE! ~Cheech & Chong
This needs to be dubbed
Absolute unit!!!!!!!
Dave is an RTO and there is a high chance of snipers in the area. Dave just decided to chill out next to the new LT and PSG.
😂
Woah Dave has a cool stick
I have seen this post a thousand times on what seems like every single sub and that’s fine but the fact that it has 125k upvotes...
Half expecting Dave to say "Roger that"
Daww, always knew Dave had a long one.
Hes picking up alien frequencies with that antenna

Clearly that is an antenna. Yet another malfunctioning government drone. r/birdsarentreal
Imma get that birb a stick.

How to spot a signaller
Dave, that's farfetch'd!
Acoustic Kitty has failed, now it is time for Hedwig FM.
Owl expressions always makes me laugh, why IDK.
