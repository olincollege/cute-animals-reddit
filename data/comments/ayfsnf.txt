I think your kitten is comforting your husband...
[removed]
That's such a pretty kitty!
I hope everything turned out OK, Mrs Dirt. 
So much love in one picture
"My life is so hard."

"I know, kitty. I know."
Cat: "The vet can't see me if I can't see the vet."
I remember doing this when my dogs were pups,just staring into their eyes seeing there fear but seeing it reduce when they put trust in you for a tiny bit of time. It's so nice to see others do 
I love the kitty forehead touchings. It‚Äôs one of the highlights of my cat ownership!
Does your husband skate? I feel like he skates. 
Marry him again. 
What a couple of sweethearts. 
My cat loves when I do this too, she starts purring and rubs her head on mine it's awesome. I like to tell myself she's thinking the same thing that I am when I do it to her; Love.
Reminds me of the corner man and a boxer praying before a a thai boxing fight
Looks to me like the kitten is lending your husband some knowledge, wisdom and serenity 
David Spade?
Remember, if the husband starts pressing his head against the wall then this could signify that he is seriously ill!
It's not easy being a parent.
Plot twist: their heads are superglued together and that's why they're at the vet.

Just curious why so many ask about his ring? Is it that big of a deal (no sarcasm, actually wondering) to not wear one these days?

My husband doesn't wear a ring. He's a machinist so things on his hands around lathes and mills are a no go for him.
This Vulcan mind meld of comfort has touched my heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Wow this blew up! 

I'm the guy in the photo (not sure if anyone cares for proof), thanks for all the kind words - also chuckled at the Joe Dirt comments haha.

Here's another photo with our little guy: https://imgur.com/1Jfcniw
Where‚Äôs your husbands wedding ring? Or are you from one of the countries where it goes on the right hand?
Face-cats are the BEST.

I love cats that will get up in your face and snuggle. When I volunteered at the animal shelter I trained the kittens to be total face-cats.
Omg that‚Äôs exactly what I do to calm my dog down. I got her as a puppy when I was like 9 and would put my head against hers because it was so soft and felt good and it just became our little thing that she always responds to now. 
The sign of a real man
Calming mind control is a beautiful thing. üôÇ
I hope this is your new lockscreen, bc if not ,it's mine
Adorable kitty and gorgeous boyfriend. It's not fair, there's only so much happiness in the world and you're hoarding it all
I just loudly whispered: ‚ÄúAwww, look at that cat!‚Äù to myself, even though I‚Äôm alone right now.. huh.
I‚Äôm pretty sure my  cats have PTSD because of the vet! The vet had cleaned out their ears when they were younger, and used cotton swabs. They proceeded to break off the end into my cats ears, twice. Since then, when I‚Äôve tried to clean them, they freak...poor kitty! That little one is adorable! 
your husband and your kitten cute as fuck.
Kitten: "Ok what's happening right now?"
Mine dives back into his crate and burrows under the towel. This is much cuter. 
Gentle souls.
My most favorite and loved cat, Baby, always was comforted by pressure on his forehead.
That cat is adorable! I hope the vet gave that little furball a clean bill of health!
He looks like Troy Baker
I wish everyone was like you guys
i wish my cat was that small again.. 

now he just a big ol' biatch 
My cat would headbutt me all the time when he was a kitten and I used to hate it because his skull is pretty hard - it would actually hurt when he‚Äôd do it. As he‚Äôs gotten older, he‚Äôs stopped doing it and now I miss it so much.
Top-tier Cat Dad right there. 
way to rub your hot husband and super cute kitty in our faces OP! 
You can tell a lot about someone with how they treat animals.  Your husband must be a good egg.
Justin Bieber's gas station look 
Please don‚Äôt take this as me being that person who wants to shit on a nice moment. Just on the offhand that you haven‚Äôt been told before-kitties do much better with harnesses vs collars when it comes to using a leash. The collars are supposed to always be breakaway because cats can get caught on stuff, and a harness (specifically made for cats) is better and more comfortable for control.


Hope the visit goes okay! Congrats on your beautiful kitty, best wishes for the upcoming wedding too. 
Someone close to me took their 10 month old bunnies to the vet yesterday and one had an undiagnosed lung condition and wasn't able to cope with anaesthesia. I felt so bad for them, so it is so wonderful to hear a good story today.

Cat is the dominant one, didn't close it's eyes
so uh just curious... the kitten is fine... right? = \
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok little leopard... you‚Äôre the King of the Jungle.. never forget.‚Äù
Be one with your kitty...check!
I was wondering why your husband didn't have a ring on his left hand but then I realize that the image was flipped. Your husband is the cat.
Beautiful picture. Your kitty has such a pretty coat too üíú
I'd say marry him, but you already did. 
when i take my cat to the vet he always pisses himself no matter what 
Can I borrow your husband when I have to go to the dentist? 
Mind meld... I'm dying from such love and trust. You go dad üêæüíû! 
This is the cutest thing ever 
[deleted]
This is so adorable 
Ok,  never divorce this man.  He's just like my husband, men like this are keepers. 
Damnnnn hottie alert 
Kitty headbutts are the best! üòç
"Don't worry tiny tiger all will be okay"
Meanwhile one of my kittens just bit my foot for reasons unknown. 
Such a pure picture‚ù§
Methinks the kitten is comforting your husband 
This shows so much trust between person and animal. A mutual understanding that they care about each other enough to not bite out an eye, even though they totally could.
That guy looks like he sells shitty weed to dumb teens and tries to date them. Tell him to stop touching that poor kitty. 
I work as a veterinary assistent and people like you guys really make my day! It always brings a smile to my face when I see a loving owner. It's a great rewarding job but it's not always fun and games, to say the least. 
Sweet picture, but that face hair tho? 
Yeah, she just happened to be in that perfect spot with her camera ready to catch this authentic moment.
They‚Äôre both so beautiful 
This really blew up! To answer some questions... we consider ourselves married, ring or not. There is no signed paper but I don‚Äôt feel the need to justify our relationship! 

The cats name is Polkaroo, originally Loki. He is a Bengal that we found on a local buy/sell page. We are his 4th and final home. He is very healthy and very happy. He loves straws and his big brother, Dipstick, our white cat with a black tail. 

Your husband with no ring? 
marry him again.
I‚Äôm just gonna say it your husband is hot as fuck!
[deleted]
[deleted]
That guy does not look like someones husband.
We call this "holy time" in my house.  Good for the soul.
OMG so adorable.  Nothing better than kitten headbutts. Hope he feels better soon. 
That fur pattern ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
This is so pure omg
AWwwww that's so sweet!  My husband tried that with our cat last time we had to take him in and was rewarded with 3 deep gouges to the face.  Our poor guy was a stray for a year and then in a shelter for 4, with a vet who was super rough with him.  He was allllll love when we got home and kept trying to lick the gouges on my husbands face.  Trying to say sorry, we think!  Kitties are the best!
Aww so cute! Random but your husband looks EXACTLY like French tennis player Lucas Pouille, even down to the backwards ball cap
Can‚Äôt help but head butt my cats while saying ‚Äúbonk‚Äù 
My mind to your mind
Cool patterning!
Psychic connection calms your pets? That's much easier.
That‚Äôs ‚ù§Ô∏èlove!!!
Ur cat is cute and so is ur husband good job OP
Oh, my god. He is super adorable.

The kitten is really cute, too.
This is what I do with my cats when I feel scared or when I know a scary time for them is about to come.

It works.

And your husband is great for doing this. 
Human being a bro to kitty
Do you ever think the head-butting is actually them trying to read your mind?
It's a home cat? Do you let him free or he goes outdoor for walks, like a dog? You have a very nice cat, take care of him<3
I hope your kitty is ok
My cat would do the same then attack my hand. So cute...so deadly. 
That guy‚Äôs a keeper. You should probably marry him...oh. Wait.  Hey. Good for you. üëçüèª
You picked a good husband 
Being a cat dad requires so much strength. We must remain calm under pressure. And always be ready to snuggle... always.
Is that David spades kid 
Both cat and husband are gorgeous!
My cat had to have his blood pressure taken once.  If no one has had their cat's blood pressure taken, they do it three times, and average it out.  It's not uncommon for cats to move and destroy the reading (hence the three times and the average).  I picked up my cat while they were doing it because you could see he was FREAKED.  The readings after that dropped like a rock.  They had to do it again, as I recall, because they had such an outlier now.  

I was literally able to see how much I was able to relax my cat by simply holding him.  

<3

Fuck all the cancers, and the one that took him.  Love you forever, buddy Max.
Lol I do the same thing with my little dude
Such moments make life really worth living; a great picture with an excellent emotional transmission üòÄ

I am very happy for you that the little cute one with the beautifully drawn fur had nothing bad and that he's healthy again. Please give him extra caresses from me üò∏
10/10 keeper right here
This is a simply beautiful photo. I‚Äôm glad to see your kitty is going okay. 
I also have a bengal myself but she‚Äôs a snow bengal.  Such a beautiful breed ‚ù§Ô∏è
Marry him again 

Got yourself a keeper right there
Wow. I‚Äôd frame that one. 
So cute!


And the kitten's good too i guess
Lil boo
Cute!
Priceless. ‚ù§
Whenever I take my cat to the vet he becomes the most affectionate creature. He won't relax until he has a paw on both my shoulders so he can nuzzle my face. 
Holy fuck, you're married to Jason Mews? That's hella cool
Marry him again. 
Ah, he's cute - also the kitten
The execution of that head boop is flawless.
Head butts from kitty means love and comfort, and sometimes they follow up with rubbing up against you. "Dis is mine."
I assume that‚Äôs your husband on the right. 
it‚Äôs jeff from american dad 
It's ok The Lion King is only a movie! 
my mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts 
You looking for a sister in law?
*our husband 
That is an exceptionally beautiful cat
Holy wow!  Your husband looks like he could be one of my siblings.   Also, cute kitty!
Marry him.
Your husband looks like Justin Bieber if you squint 
Omg I have a similar pic of my husband and our dog when she was a puppy
I do this all the time with my cat üòäüòä
He's comforting the cat because it has to live with a bell, poor thing.
What a beautiful picture!
I used to do that headbutt with my kitty... I miss him.
<3
Headbutt of love.  Your cat must really like him.
Awwww
Beautiful!

And so is the cat and the moment.
That‚Äôs the most beautiful cat I‚Äôve ever seen!! 
Ooh he looks quite a lot like one of our bengals. I love the rosetted pattern.
this is adorable!!
When we go to the vet with my cat she curls against our body and hides her face in our arms, it's really sweet
Aww sooo cute 
That picture is frame worthy!
I have a cat who loves head boops. 
this is the fucking cutest shit i‚Äôve ever seen 
My HEART!! This is so stinkin sweet
Marry him again. üòÅ
That's a beautiful pattern.
No wedding ring ... fake news
My cat and I used to do that all the time. It was our telepathic pose where I would talk to him in my mind, pretending he could hear me and if he couldn't so what. The moment was for us. He seemed to really dig that and stayed with me in those moments, as if he was all in no matter what.
Or was the cat comforting the husband? we underestimate the emotional impact these animals have on our lives. I have a couple or cats and one of them I have a bond with, if anything happens to her it would devastate me.
Omg your husband has one of the best noses I've ever seen, like it reminds me of greek statues!
Very sweet. 
Oh my God, your husband sounds amazing. Marry him.
That's precious! Frame worthy!
This is such a sweet photo. üòª
Your husband looks like Ryan Gosling. No offense. üòä
Oh man I get so nervous and uptight at vet visits. 
Too cute.

They both seem to have this connection going on
Is that Justin Bieber
Who‚Äôs comforting who ?
Looks like a scene outta how to train your dragon
Aw look at the little buddies. 
‚ÄúMy mind to your mind. Your mind to my mind.‚Äù
This is so cute 
I don't know why, but resting your forehead against an animals is so comforting and makes you feel super connected. 
Awwww the kittie looks like he is trying to be at peace with the vet. Daddy is helping to keep kittie caln. It is just so freaking cute. 
PRICELESS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
What a beauty! What kind of cat? 
Awww üòçüòò
That is so sweet!  What a beautiful kitty! 
What a pretty coat‚ù§Ô∏è
You definitely made the right choice by marrying him. 
This is so heartwarming
I don‚Äôt know why, but my forehead is tingling from looking at this.
Well awesome where the wedding ring 
This is adorable.  I literally awwwwwed out loud 
are you supposed to wear your wedding ring on the left hand? 
bengal?
That's a whole lotta cute wonderfulness in one picture.  Congrats!
My mind to your mind
He's a good hooman
Well I‚Äôm dead. 
AWWWWWWWW
Purrrrrfect timing.
You're lucky to have a husband and kitty like that..
this is the most precious thing i‚Äôve ever seen 
This is equal parts beautiful and sexy. My emotions are going crazy.
Ok but domt firget the fact this is not a kitten but a Jaguar
Daannngg, he's cute too.
That‚Äôs a keeper!
r/upvotebecauseboy
Your husband looks like my friend Jordan.
Marry him again.
Your husband seems like good people.  That‚Äôs a sweet picture.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt make the team, Dad. I tried so hard.‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs gonna be fine, son. You did great. I am so so proud of you for getting out there and giving it your all.‚Äù
Love this picture!

Marry him again.
So sweet üíó
So cute
Never stop loving this man.
Ready to get his balls pulled off
That man is a keeper!!!!
My mind to your mind, my thoughts to your thoughts.
If we could love our fellow man the way we love our fellow man‚Äôs cat the world would be a better place.
You are blessed.
Divorce this man so you can immediately marry him again
They are both so sweet. 
Awwww, that's a very loving daddy and his baby, 
I love it, and so does his little furry üòç baby
Marry him harder
This is a cat hug!!! ‚ù§‚ù§  
This just melted my heart
Aw a bengal. He/shes gonna be an amazing buddy, they always are. 
Your husband not wearing his ring?
"You is mine".
Is that an ocelot or something? 
Such a beautiful kitty.  Love the markings!
Dunno why, but I've always done this with animals. There's a photo of me doing the empathic head touch with a deer somewhere, back in the pre-digital days. Glad I'm not the only one! 
#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/christycann!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
Your bengal is beautiful!
I would gladly comfort them both üòâüòÜ
Aww. May life bring you love and peace 
Awwwe that is sweet, lucky the cat looks so chill. Most would have already planted their nails the face!
Ahhh. Looks like the kitty is comforting your hubby.... does he date btw.... he‚Äôs a hottie.

That's how we hug
What a cute kitten! Also, your husband is really handsome. He also has nice hands.
I think it's the other way around.
We got this!
That is so cute. I miss cat head rubs :(
This is an awesome pic. Sooo many feels.
Awww
So sweet‚ô•Ô∏è
That‚Äôs so much love. üíïüò≠
This is such a beautiful picture. Thank you.

FTFY
Is your husband single?
I mean, some people don‚Äôt always follow old fashioned ways. We consider ourselves married and that‚Äôs that. :) 
Does your husband work at a Vans outlet
Was he adopted? I mean your husband. Did his parents find him in a park taped to a swing?

edit: whoever down-voted, your moves are weak.

edit2: my reference is not coming across. is it all moms in here?
The pets like my wife best until we go to the vets. Anyone else have that experience?
I'm SOBBING. This is so precious üò≠
You sure he didnt just deliver a pizza nearby?
Your husband is handsome lol
But where‚Äôs the wedding ring
[deleted]
i guess pac sun is still a thing 
Kurt Cobain reincarnated. 
Dude has Joe Dirt facial hair heh. (Sorry had to say it)
Not trying to be rude or anything, but is the image flipped?

I don‚Äôt see a ring.

Again, not trying to start shit I promise just wondering that‚Äôs all.
This is just a person with a pet. This happens 20 times a day in every household that has pets. Man, reddit is weird.
Please get your kitten a harness. Attaching your leash to their collar is considered unsafe by most vets and risks neck injuries if they decide to flip out for whatever reason. I have seen my cat flip out on a leash, trust me you don't want to try that with just a collar. 
your husband is David Spade?
Why is his beard like that>
Your husband's cute üòç
>~~my~~ husband comforting our kitten at the vet

our husband

-your new sister wife
Looks like your husband lives with his mom and sells weed
He is a good ‚Äòdaddy‚Äô!   Thank him for that!   Most men aren‚Äôt that way!
.::WOOOOSH PHFFFFFFT::. The sound of 100s of panties hitting the floor!
I don't see a ring bitch
Where‚Äôs his wedding ring?
Why do people care about the lack of a ring? I don‚Äôt wear a ring ever not will I. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
your husband wears no weeding ring. not sure if you noticed :( 
Your husband doesn‚Äôt wear a ring? 
No ring?
Husband with no ring?
So weird, when I read ‚Äúhusband‚Äù I imagine a 40-something smiling bald guy with a large gut. I forget young attractive people get married and have this title.
It just seems so posed...
You're married?? Oh my God that's amazing!
No wedding ring on his left hand?
Is your cat single?
Jk. It's heart warming to see this level of trust between a cat and a human. What a beautiful pic!
Where his ring doe üëÄ 
I dont see a ring on his finger
Is his name Matt?
beautiful bengal baby! 
Both look sweet
This is precious. I'd order a print of this and frame it. 
This photo is perfect. I was gonna tell you you need to marry him before I read the title lmao
They look so peacefull, actually I am feeling more peacefull thanks to that picture! Hope your cat is okay! 
Is your husband Kenny Omega?
[removed]
I‚Äôll try, 
Do not worry brother, for we will be united in the next life.
To small to be a cat to big to not be a cat
You have two keepers there. 
Oh my gosh!!! How adorable
My sweetie nose-bumps the cat as a formal greeting.  This looks more like your kitty is giving your sweetie a motivation pep talk followed by a meditation moment to focus on what needs to be done next, like taking him the fuck home so he can get some crunchies.
Why does this look like it could be a Renaissance painting?
Awww that‚Äôs so cute! 
Very sweet, they are comforting each other ü§ì I hope both are doing well ü§ì
Beautiful kitty! I recommend investing in a harness, my Bengal loves his and they're great for walks.
They are loud, can be mean. Maybe mine just takes after me. Mine enjoys stalking my other cat. The giant dogs just stay away from him.

Never put a collar on mine. He'd lose his shit. 
Looks like Jared Goff lol
What an awesome human! 
Beautiful Bengal kitty
I LOVE KITTENS!
Awww, my cat and I did the same exact thing.  
Never found out who was comforting whom tho. And really, does it matter? :)
In my house we call this ‚Äúforehead love‚Äù and it is my cats FAVORITE thing. You haven‚Äôt really been woken up until you‚Äôve been woken up by a kitty head butting his love into your life. 
If Kid Rock and Ryan Gosling had a child..
They have the same hair color aw
This reinforced how much I love my cats. Good on you guys for taking proper care of that kitten.
I love this!! 
I think that comfort is going both ways
Cat kisses !! What else!! We would be kissing our babies in our own way 

Awww bless! I was just telling my best friend yesterday how cool I think guys who aren‚Äôt afraid to like cats (or admit it) are. Look like a keeper (or two) ü•∞
I hope your kitty is ok (since you're at the vet. Hopefully just a checkup)  üòä‚úå
That is sooo adorable!  üêà
My husband holding out kitten for a photo and you taking it as fast as you can before it moves at the vet
Good man. 
Welp, my heart just exploded and I‚Äôm dead now, thanks.
What a good cat

I will now reward you with 5 min of uninterrupted eye contact.

Both are keepers. 
I wish I could articulate how much I enjoy this picture.
This is beautiful. 
Oh my goodness, how sweet. ‚ô•
Aww I miss kittens, all the cats in my life are getting old :(
This is probably one of the cutest pictures I‚Äôve ever seen 
You have a good man!
Your husband looks like he‚Äôs a good dude. 
Jay Cutler lost some weight. 
Wow he looks like a tiny ocelot
Odd caption 
Wow, husband + kitten goals 
Wow how cute, the kitten is cute also,lol
I love bengals 
That‚Äôs a good man. 
Think it‚Äôs vice versa 
**My. Heart.**
That's a flerken
That is so sweet. I love everything about this picture. 
Looks like the dude from the documentary ‚Äúminding the gap‚Äù
That's so sweet!
He‚Äôs probably just trying to tell him to loosen the damn collar 
Looks like it's the other way around. 
They are supporting each other, so cute!

Nothing more attractive than the man you love caring for a precious little animal. And the animals get double the love!

This picture is very cute
Meeting of the minds 
Dude looks like kenny omega.
You sure he isn‚Äôt beaming mind energy into the cat?
I do this with out cat frequently!  we face bump daily, ESPECIALLY when he gets wild and stressed from things that are different (stray rescue as a kitten, indoor/leash only)
Embrace eternity.
A bengal kitten ‚ù§Ô∏è. However be aware these beauties are SUPER active. They will destroy property if they aren‚Äôt getting enough stimulation/exercise/playtime. 
That is a beautiful Bengal!!! 
Cats tend to be very good at judging character. Your husband must be a kind and gentle guy.
Hottieee!!!!!
I am a dog person; but that's an impactful image - 

hope kittie is all-ok
Lucky girl x 2!
Bonding pair, if i ever seen one.  My younger sister and I just got kittens, we've always been dog people.  We got two, brothers, Claude and Wayne.
I love headbutting with cats.  Feels like you're really connecting with them for some reason.
What a pretty coat!
Is that Charlie? 
Never seen a cat with that color.  It looks like a baby leopard??
Cannon?
Wheres the wedding ring?
Marry him again.
I like cats!
Great picture of PewDiePie!
My Bengal‚Äôs weird. Scared around strangers, loud noises, etc. at home but completely relaxed at the vet, even when they took him in another room. I think he‚Äôs broken lol.
/r/cuteguyswithcats
OP, Is your husband's name Josh by chance? He looks just like my co-worker
Nice
Marry him-- wait.
They both look so peaceful
Is your husband Ryan Gosling?
Okay, is there anything more pure than this?!

Looks like the dude from Yes Theory.

This is actually false you can clearly see they are speaking to each other through telepathy
Telecathy

Awww üíï what‚Äôs the kitty‚Äôs name?
He looks like a good dude, 10/10 would let comfort me.
Similar coloration - same breed?
Support the Mrs. and put your god damned ring on. Lol
Joe Dirt's lost brother! Also I hope your kitten is okay, best wishes to you all
Is your husband named Kyle?
Your husband has 'qualities of a saint' according to one of my friends. 
I've got the exact same patchy facial hair.
This is so cute!!
That‚Äôs such a sweet picture 
Thanks hooman , this pleases ne now let me get my balls shaved.
This is way too adorable, now I want five of those to smush on my face!
Forehead to forehead with a cat means they accept you as their own or you accept them as yours, supposedly, I make sure to get that trust with each of my cats. 
The kitten's eyes are still open.  Watch your back.
Is your husband the guy from Yes Theory?
I'm guessing it's for a check-up/vaccinations for the lil' kitty? Even so this is something I'd do with my cat if I ever had to take her up to the vet.
Awww kittty! I hope the kitty is fine and well. 
Lovely kitten and lovely husband and lovely photo.
He looks like cassidy campbell
I do this to my cat all the time, and try to understand what he‚Äôs thinking
Is that Jared Goff
Noggin! *doink*
Bengal's are fucking amazing. Hope yours is ok.
I double tapped this picture LIKE AN IDIOT. 
SMOLCAT WAT R U DOIN
How‚Äôs it feel to be married to the starting qb of the LA Rams
I like your husband‚Äôs joe dirt look
I've heard that pressing of the head against something indicates some sort of disease. You should have your husband checked out.
That's a very pretty Bengal. 
What breed of kitten is it? It looks kinda like a bengal, I used to have one that did the same thing

This gives me some real Hiccup and Toothless feels...üò≠üò≠üò≠
Those pretty patterns üòç
I have a kitty that doesn't like being handled, but is plenty affectionate on her own terms.  I cherish her headbonks when she's in the mood.  
I'm sorry, I'm sure you're husband is a great dude, and I really am sorry about this, but...

...is your husband named kyle?
Does anyone have a link to that guy petting the angry exotic cat that was hissing last week? Random question I know but I want to show my dad and can't find it. 
Hey that's Kevin Federline!!
I‚Äôll take one of each 
your husband is hotttt

Acting not to care is like a little kid when you kiss them and then they wipe it off.
This is so sweet. Hopefully all turned out well!

Pardon me but I want this on a calendar 
This reminds me of my man and our kitty. That bond is unbreakable.
It looks like they're communicating telepathically.
Nothin better than a kitty boop 
Kitty mind-meld in progress.
So cute!

The cat is nice, too.
Reminds me of my little 9 year old tabi, Data.
I need comforting too. Please send cat.
Such complete trust, is totally disarming. We are not worthy.
Pals, keeping each other positive 
That photo is going to make countless ovaries explode.
Looms like this could be some kind of soft rock album cover or something.
he looks like he's giving the kitty a football huddle before a big game. adorable. 
What a beutiful kitten it looks like a mountain lion.üòé
Get yer husband on r/fierceflow
Ayyyy a Bengal! My wife and I breed them :3 it's always nice to see them online 
I make sure I do this daily with our cat. It's comforting for both of us. 
That's sweet. Thankful that kitty has you guys. 
This might be the cutest thing I've seen today. 
Used to do this with my dog ever since he was around a year old. Afterwards he'd lean into my chest and rub up against me. It was such a great mix of sweetness and trust. That's awesome that your cat trusts you enough to do this with you!
Awww....good man. 
lovely capture 
Wow. Amazing.

I hope the vet was able to separate them as painlessly as possible. Getting superglued to a cat like that must have been quite the misadventure!
Do this with my cat every day when I get home
I hate this subreddit.

There's two type of aww on this sub first "aww that is so cute" and "aww that is so cute but sad."
U r no longer needed in the family lol
Is your husband's name kyle?
weird beard 
That is really sweet, love and trust in both directions there.

Also, I am pretty sure I bought weed from that dude back in the day.

Joking aside, ignore all the comments about Joe Dirt, your guy is definitely better looking (and clearly a good man). But he does look like he's holding, just saying : )
Both nodding out from all the opiates.... team work makes the dream work 
Your husband is Joe Dirt?
That kitten's eyes are wide open like "why are we doing this?"
Is your husband Jeff from American Dad?
Looks like Blaine Gabbert
I know you can hear my thoughts boy. ‚ÄúMEOW MIX! MEOW MIX! IT DELIVERS!‚Äù

Your cat is a bold one.
"We want it more than he does, no pain, no pain"
No wedding ring?
Hmmm....my kitten that needed comforting just decided my back, under my big heavy coat was a perfect spot
Your husband looks like Joe Dirt
Does kitty do well on a leash? Or does he/she resort to being dragged everywhere? 
Hope the kitty is ok! You should get a harness for it instead of a leash. No hate just a suggestion.
Is your husband joe dirt 
spiritual egyptian ritual care for toxoplasmosis

Thats awesome. Not trying to take away from it but the first thing I saw was your husband's Joe Dirt chops.

My toughs to your toughsüòÇ
Recently put my cat down, we both gave each other comfort until the very last moment.
Where's his wedding ring then...? üßê
Where‚Äôs the ring?
Where‚Äôs the ring 
No ring = no husband 
This is super cute! But it's not safe to attach a leash to a collar for a cat. Cats should only wear breakaway collars, and should only ever have a leash attached to a harness. They dont have collar bones (part of the reason the can do those crazy body twist, and fit in small places) so using a collar can cause a lot of damage to the throat.
It's not that deep 
Your husband looks like a mix of Jay Cutler, Justin Bieber, and Joe Dirt
Did he forget his ring?
No ring?
Where the wedding ring at tho
I see no wedding band on that hand.

That facial hair doesn‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs supposed to be doing.  Am I a beard?  What do I identify as?
/r/AccidentalRenaissance 
Awww that kitten got to meet Joe Dirt.  I'd say I'm jealous but well I'm not.
"Now, you're telling me you were so ingrained with white trash DNA, your facial hair actually grows in on its own all white trashy like that?"
Hubby doesn't wear a ring?
Have you told him to consider shaving that fucking mess on his face?
I would put it down before I would spend any money on a cat
