Well, I have witnessed how the mothers do this in the wild, wish I had a video to share.  Baby doesn't want to go in water...... Mother and child sound off at each other for about 30 seconds.  Mother grabs child by scruff of neck and throws child in water.  It was a Wow experience.
Video is too short
The way he looks up at his caretaker ü•∫ melts my heart
This video led me to find that the Osaka aquarium has a YouTube channel with tons of great content. https://youtube.com/user/OsakaKaiyukan

Including more videos of this pup flopping around of course https://youtu.be/F2WLePoc70o
Oh no it's like "I am so small....why are you putting me in the water...."
"No no. No I don't like. Oh, oh no. Oh. Oooh."
Near where I live there are sometimes baby seals on the beach. The mothers leave them there while they are out in the sea (Hunting I presume).

The local coastguard have to keep their shit tight when the locals report it to them because fuckhead tourists come along and chase them into the sea thinking they are going to be instagram heroes who saved a baby seal. What they don't know is that the mother left the baby there very deliberately and baby seals are REALLY bad at swimming until they reach a certain maturity, and if chased into the sea they usually drown.

What a cute little sea pupper ü•∞
That's adorable, the seal's cute floofy face is 'awww worthy' indeed :)
Omg that little look up like "you got me, right?". Melted my heart.
Is this part of the "Navy Seal Training Programm" ?
That pool will never leak with such a good seal.

What training do I need to get this dream job?
A lot of people are posting they were tossed in the water too. My daughter had inflatable arm bands. Every time we were about to get in the pool, I let out a little air. After a few weeks they were empty. I told her she didn't need them and she had a fit. Her eyes were huge when I pushed the empty armbands underwater and they stayed there.
I cannot stress this enough. I have made horrible decisions in life that have caused me to not have that job.
Give that little guy a few fish! So brave.
Omg just look at that poof potato!!!!
This is probably the cutest thing I've ever seen.
I feel kinda dumb every time I see these videos because I love animals but it never occurred to me that if a seal pup doesn't have a seal parent it's not gonna know how to seal swim to get seal food.
Do we need any more proof to say that seals are just sea doggos?
Nene
Matanene!
Sea potato getting seasoned for the first time
You can see the happiness once he gets it
"No no no no no no no oh ok thanks"
This ended waaay too soon.
You're so gentle with it.  Super cute!
Serious question, does the seal really need the humans help to learn how to swim?
It's so cute it hurts.
instincts doin a kick-in
Go little guy go!
Oh that Mr. Is being extra gentle :3
Baby seal: what are you doing stop, no! Dont leave me plea... omg....OMG!! XD
That is the cutest animal I've ever seen
Look how gentle and reassuring he is with the pup. That‚Äôs so beautiful. I love animal people!
Smol cloud doing a swim
Pfft not that deep, I could swim in that.
Baby seal: I was born for this.
"I'm 15 days old and this is deep."
Never realized seals could be white besides albino ones
Where's the seals mother?
How does one even get into this field of work, literally any type of animal care like this is a dream come true for me
Aquatic puppy
I love seals and otters so much üò≠üíï Round wet doggos!
Omg his little hands making little air flappies is the cutest damn thing other than the look up to the guy he trusts before taking the plunge. Adorable.
baby seals are the cutest of all time and no one EVER will tell me different. they're just giant clouds with eyes and a mermaid tail \*eeeeeeeeeeeeeee\*
I love how he waits for the baby to feel safe and pull away before letting him go
Just love how he looked up like ‚Äúare you sure about this because i‚Äôm not‚Äù.
For a second I thought it said navy seal
That ended way, way too soon.
SO FUCKING CUTE
Funny how it's half a fish and it doesn't know it
That guy is the training wheels.
I can't touch the bottom, I can't touch the bottom, oh wait, I am a swim doggo.
Paro!
The way he looks up, making eye contact with him for reassurance, all's going to be ok, right friend?
I love how you can see comprehension dawn in the baby's eyes, "Oh... I floats AND swishes."
Pretty sure they only get around 2 weeks to learn how to swim in the wild. Then the mother leaves.
I‚Äôve never seen a pupper like him! I will protecc.
Do they not know how to swim instinctively?
How fucking cute is this?!
Oh I floats
That waggle at the end. Melting my cold dead heart.
That is... a good boi

That seals a natural!
The Osaka Kaiyukan Aquarium is amazing. If you ever have a chance to visit, do it.
The way the pup looks up at the man for assurance melted my heart.
That questioning look the seal gives him at first."Are you sure this is ok?" and then, the realization on his face :-) "Oh! I see! This isn't so bad!" My heart.
Seal *looks at human*please sir don‚Äôt let me die
Man holding seal: buddy your made for this shit just stay cool
Seal *obviously panicking as the water gets deeper* hooman!
Human: 
Seal: this is actually okay‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôm okay
It‚Äôs how I taught my dog to swim. He loved the water after the that!

Sea puppy!
uhoo the seal might get the covid now
‚ÄúNooo.. oh wait... I float? Well ok then.‚Äù
He looks like a puppy, then like a fish when he starts swimming.
If so many kids' dads had done this instead of just willy-nilly throwing them (without warning) into the deep end, more kids would be comfortable with swimming and perhaps feel more confident in themselves.
I'm 14 and this is deep pool
I find seals cute and creepy at the same time.

This is the cutest fucking thing I‚Äôve ever seen.

I felt more affection toward that baby seal watching this than I have ever felt toward a human baby in my entire life.

This Seal is literally an Aquatic Mammal, it does not need some land mammal to assist it into the water as if it might drown.
Why am I in the deep end pool of the Orca tank?? 

Oh wait
Something, something, something seal swim clubbing, there's a joke in there somewhere, but I'm not that clever.

Why so gentle? Surely you can just toss them in and they‚Äôll be fine. Ive seen puppies be introduced to water with less timidness.
Why the fuck does that guy have a mask on?
Cute, a future fur coat xD
Wonder what seals taste like.
