That dog has been growing talons for months in preparation for this moment. 
Looks towards camera...

Dog: you seeing this shit?

"I know I could absolutely destroy that cat, but that wouldn't be the nice thing to do."
Cat:  Look at your nails. You need to clip them. 

Dog:  I don‚Äôt like the trimmers. 

Cat:  haha!  You‚Äôre such a wimp!! Big polka dotted wimp!

Dog:  I‚Äôll show you who is a wimp!

He looks scared shitless. He's like mom help me... I'm having to defend myself but I am so scared

Control of the TV remote was clearly involved. 
Dat cat was *begging* for a showdown ... and *will* be back for more.

Keep us posted OP. My $$ is on the cat. 
I was concerned at first when he gave up the high ground 
If that Dalmation with a red collar isn't named Pongo, it will keep me up at night.
TLDR; ‚Ä¢ Trimming his nails was traumatic and felt inhumane ‚Ä¢ Vet said it wasn‚Äôt necessary, so I stopped ‚Ä¢ Posted this to Reddit and was immediately set straight within 5 seconds ‚Ä¢ I promise I love and properly care for my sweet, spoiled, tender-hearted baby of dog ‚Ä¢ Although he may beg to differ after his highly protested and unconventional manicure tomorrow ‚Ä¢ Are we cool now, Reddit? :)


 Yes, yes, yes... his nails are long. I know. He HATES getting them trimmed so when the vet said it wasn‚Äôt necessary, we jumped on that. They definitely don‚Äôt look pretty, but this feels like a more humane alternative than inflicting unnecessary trauma for the sake of cosmetics. 

Thank you for your concern (honestly, no sarcasm) but I promise this is a well cared for and extremely loved dog. At ease, internet soldiers. :)

EDIT: I‚Äôve been getting tons of advice on the matter (and shockingly only a few mean comments - you feeling okay tonight, Reddit?!) and am now fully equipped on various tricks and methods needed to start gently reintroducing him to the concept. Thanks everyone! Cross your fingers for us...
Is this a Great Dane-Dalmatian mix? Or just a very large Dalmatian?
I‚Äôm showing this to my wimpy pooch for inspiration. 
Well now the cat is going to piss on your laundry.
He seems like such a tender soul. Love this dog. 
The little mustache on the cat makes him look 10x more evil üòÇ I love it. 
Flicky tail by the cat gives it all away.  They‚Äôre agitated when they do it, sometimes they‚Äôre assholes and just get themselves worked up. 
Brave dog!
Is it just me or did the cat look like it kinda had a mustache pattern? I thought he kinda looked like a villain with it. 
Saw his nails and was sad until I saw OP say his vet told him it wasn‚Äôt necessary to cut them?! That‚Äôs nuts.  I used to work in dog grooming and saw a ton more nails worse than this, but for some dogs it seriously is traumatic.  Some people have to get their dogs sedated every few months so that the vet can just cut them back as far as they can for the time being.  Love your pup and puss cat‚ù§Ô∏è
My Boston terrier goes ape shit when I cut his nails but if I hold him like a baby belly up in my arms and have my wife cut them he‚Äôs super docile.  I know your dogs huge but if you can man handle him/her like that and have some one cut them it may work... wear a long coat or jacket the first time if your holding
Oh my god your dog looks like he has hearts around his eyes!!! 
I‚Äôve been crying and this made me laugh so hard thank you
Can somebody please turn this into a gif and add subtitles of what they‚Äôre saying
This thread is soooo Reddit! Few people are like awww, or that‚Äôs so cute. It just turned into a ‚Äúdogs with long nails‚Äù debate
I love how his face just says "dad, what do I do?" üòÇüòÇ
Looks at his pawrent and says,‚Äù you see this! He‚Äôs touching me!‚Äù
Hopefully I don't offend, but all I can think as as a vet tech is that dog needs it's nails clipped
Wow your cat is beautiful, and a giant asshole. I love him.
My cat is the same way with my other cat. She starts fights with him and since he's like twice her size, he can throw her around easily. 

She starts it, he wins it, she gets pissy about it. Dumb cat.
In the vein of so much help for OP's mani/pedi woes, do any of you doggo wizards have advice for brushing my baby's teeth? She always acts like I'm trying to force-feed her poison, and then she gives me the cold shoulder for hours. I feel like a terribly cruel parent when I try, even though I know it's good for her
i actually screamed out loud "yeahhhh!". 
Don‚Äôt believe everything you see on the internet. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/7xaobk/addendum_for_everyone_who_was_concerned_about_my/?st=JK24AHKK&sh=0f6295ad) is what they‚Äôre usually up to... :)

Oh and yes, his toenails need to be trimmed, no, I didn‚Äôt realize how irresponsible it was to let them grow, yes my vet was misinformed and no, good boye‚Äôs not going to like it but they‚Äôre getting clipped tomorrow, anxiety or not, thanks to all the helpful tips and tricks posted here. Thanks Reddit. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Dude that is exactly how my dalmatian fights too! Her arms go straight as board and she air punches just hoping to land something lol
The cat is most probably plotting his revenge. Red wedding style

Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I love dogs and we don‚Äôt deserve them but damn I love cats. 
I like how he looks back and is like, ‚ÄúIf this McFluffy¬Æ continues to mess with me I just want to be sure that you know that this shit ends today.‚Äù
I always get happy to see a Dalmatian. They are such a rare breed. I know it‚Äôs something to do with eye problems right? They are so beautiful 
Is he pure dalmatian? Almost looks like he‚Äôs got a little bit of greyhound in him.
You could see him being firm but gentle.

Man, I smoked a few minutes ago and am now laying in bed and watched this video and I felt like I was watching a movie. I even imagined the sound effects. GREAT!
I think you need to have your dogs claws clipped. They are quite long and can catch and do them harm. 
Looks like your dogs nails need trimmed
That dog **really** needs its nails trimmed. 
those nails need to be cut
Dude trim your dogs nails please 
Holy shit trim your dogs nails or walk it more often
Thats why I am a dog person :P He looked into the camera first with the expression "You seeing this shit ?" while the cat is just a dickhead.
When I annoy my bf and I cross the line :‚Äô(
You might work with a groomer who will walk you through the process and let you build some skill under supervision while helping to keep your dog calm... In my experience with other owners I find that a lot of time the dog is just fine getting trimmed but senses the discomfort and anxiety the owner has with actually performing the trim and reacts based off that... Feeds into a viscious cycle where now you are dealing with a dog squirming that makes you more anxious and offputs your pupper further, and so on.  Just like anything traumatic, it's about slowly working the comfort back in by normalizing the task, not avoiding it.

Anywho I believe in ya and good luck... Glad to see you are taking the comments constructively and I hope that I'm not giving you advice that someone else already gave ya.   Cheers!

Edit: Oh sorry again if this has already been shared with ya. But came back to add one more thing... A nice quality set of steel sheers will help... If after a few trims you notice the blade edges look nicked or curved throw away those clippers and move to a different brand. Because you got some cheap Chinesium sub quality steel clippers and you are likely tearing the nail more than clipping it. I prefer the scissor style because they tend to have better tolerances... The "loop and die" style tend to really suck because the sheer face and the blade tend to separate while pressure is applied and does leave a very clean cut.

As far as actually trimming the nail goes... Make sure to keep styptic powder on hand... And try to avoid "slow" cutting the nail... Work with your pup to get them to allow you to hold their paw in your hand without trying to withdrawal it before ever making your first cut... Then when you do begin to trim... Line up your clippers and commit to the clip.  Even if you do accidentally clip the nail stye you will prevent a whole lot of suffering if you aren't slowly trying to clip your way through... If you snip the stye a little bit and do it quickly you will likely get a quick whimper from the dog but will have a few moments following the yip to evaluate the nail before a drop of blood will show up.  If the nail does start to bleed this will come from the center of the nail. Apply firm pressure by squeezing each side of the nail (which will manage the bleeding and actually help to manage the pain for the dog) and apply a pinch of styptic powder to the edge of the nail while continuing to pinch the nail from the sides and hold on the tip of the nail with styptic powder until the bleeding stops.  Most over the counter styptic powders include a small amount of analgesic that will help dull the pain for the dog ( never administer lidocaine to a dog btw, very bad for them).  Then move on the next nails as soon as you can so that you aren't leaving them with trauma as their last experience to associate with future trims. I generally keep fresh sterile gauze next to me and use it with the styptic powder to keep pressure on the nail in the very unlikely event I Nick one of them during the trim.  My current dogs don't have too many dark nails so it's generally not an issue for me though.

Cheers!

Best USA-Made Trimmer, More Colors & Sizes https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001IDAYAY/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_BmuwBbF200014 This is what I called the loop and die style.. they call it guillotine style... These things are generally awful as the blade tends to wiggle and wobble and then as you make the cut it creates a gap between the blade and the loop... Ugh can't imagine for a second this would be comfortable for a dog...  A better quality clipper with better tolerances control could make these more effective...but I've never found a set of these style clippers in a chain pet store that was worth a damn and so I've completely given up on this style.



That dog really needs to get those nails taken care of. Walking around on nails like that can cause joint problems. 
For folks that think dogs nails don‚Äôt need to be trimmed,  or that it‚Äôs not a huge deal......dogs nails really really *DO* need to be properly taken care of. It might feel horrible, awful, awkward, & traumatic for you to have to clip them, but in the end your dog will thank you for it. Overly long nails are a health hazard to a dog....they can get ripped out, they can bleed, they can get infected.....  there are treatments that can be given so nail trimming isn‚Äôt traumatic.... and methods to do it in a way that is less stressful on a dog and it‚Äôs owner. When it comes down to it, nail trimmings are ultimately more stressful on the owner, than the dog. Sometimes things have to be done, regardless if it‚Äôs pleasant for the owner or not. 
Cut that dog‚Äôs claws!! Damn!
Cut your dogs nails!
Man that cat is an A-Hole. ;\^}
Please get your dog‚Äôs nails trimmed.

That dog is gonna get it once nighttime falls‚Ä¶
As a vet, I care less about your dog‚Äôs nails (certainly not the worst I‚Äôve seen) and more about your cat being a brochure for diabetes. Please consult your vet about an appropriate diet or cut back on his caloric intake! He‚Äôll live longer and be a happier cat for it!
That dogs nails are huge!
The dog's toe nails need to be cut
Was it for the spot? Or just sibling rivalry?
I can tell by the dynamic of their love-quarrel relationship that your dog will be paying alimony to that cat in the future. 
They're fighting over that sweet sweet spot
$100 says the cat didn't consider that a defeat. Cats can't comprehend the concept.
First off, such a beautiful dog

Your dog‚Äôs nails are incredibly long üò≥
Please trim your pups nails. Soon. 
The cute thing about this is that the dog is clearly trying to avoid the confrontation. You can see in his eyes he's thinking something along the lines of "dude, I'm like, 5 of you. quit it."
I noticed that nobody has mentioned this yet, cut your dogs nails
You schould really do your doggo a favour and clip the nails
When the dog jumped down I was like NOOO, hold your ground! then he came back and did not disappoint.

We have a cat in the house who is an asshole but we love her nonetheless.

We rescued a German Shepherd over a year ago and he is the biggest baby, even the yorkie bosses him around. The cat especially like to pick on him but ever once in a while he will remind the cat he could end her at any moment. 

One instance was when we got him a new bone and usually when that happens she‚Äôll come and sit next to it and he‚Äôll cry because he is too afraid to get it. Well she did the same thing and he ran up and let out the biggest bark, she left him alone for a few days after that.
My Mastiff is willing to come over and wear a polka dot suit to "explain" things to the cat. He just needs a ride from the airport.
This is so comical. The Cat taunting him, pushing his nail, waiting for a reaction. The Dogs anxious expression. Ur animals are wonderful.
We did it reddit!!!
Looks like a Great Dane Dalmatian mix. What a cutie

Do you know what you call your cat's breed? I used to have a furbaby who looked just like yours until she crossed the Rainbow Bridge, but I never learned what you call that kind of coloration.
SPOILER IN TITLE DO NOT READ TITLE this definitely made me laugh out loud.
Both of them are so adorable, the dog could have mopped the cat but he was nice. Good dog.
To ask the question.... are these beautiful dogs really high energy dogs?  
Doggo did this fantastically. Good. Boy. Or girl.

Your dog could use a nail trimming. Try a dremmel, and just take off a little at a time (wait a week between trimmings) to allow the quick to recede. 
As long as the puppet can run on cement occasionally, that‚Äôll keep his nails filed and keep them from curling üëåüèΩ

This is how my house works too. The cat controls the two dogs and most of the humans. The cat also likes to lay in doorways or on the stairs so he can control where the dogs go in the house.

Dude, trim the dogs' claws
Dude.... Ef that cat.
The claws were out.  Cat shoulda fuckin' known fuckin' better.

Also please get your dog's nails trimmed.  I know, he hates it.  I know, last time he bled and it hurt him and you love him, but he needs you to trim his nails.

Just a little bit at a time; so you don't actually cut to the quick.  (Yes that's where that phrase comes from.)
That‚Äôs dangerous to let your dog and cat fight like that. Cats can easily blind a dog. 
I take my dogs to the groomers and o e doesn't care of her nails are cut but the other loses her shit. I hold her in my arms and she just flails about and I usually just end up walking away with scratches all over but slowly she is getting better. It's a work in progress but she's small so it makes it easy that I can just pick her up and deal with her that way.

Also helps that she uses a Dremel to end them Dien which seems quicker
You need to clip your dogs nails

This reminded me why I don‚Äôt like cats 
YOU GO BOI
The GOODEST OF BOYS!
The cat is obviously on the defensive and hostile because it feels threatened. And though it‚Äôs cute that the Dalmatian is unsure of how to react at first, you don‚Äôt want to encourage the dog fighting back. Having lived around Dals for more than 16 years, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that they are very capable of gravely injuring or killing cat-sized animals. Knowledge gained from experience. 
please cut your dog's nails
Dude, your dogs nails look hella too long.


Overheard in OPs living room after this:

‚ÄúHe got me,‚Äù LeCat said of the dog's attack. "That f***ing dog boomed me."

LeCat added, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs so good,‚Äù repeating it four times.

LeCat then said he wanted to add the dog to the list of animals he plays with this summer. 

What are those sticking out of the dog's paws?
Still love cats, sorry

You need to get the nails trimmed on that pup. It'll take a few times because you can only do a little at a time.
Dude, you need to dremel your dog‚Äôs nails. They‚Äôre way too long. I recommend a dremel tool to grind them down. If you use dog nail clippers, you run the risk of creating micro fractures in the nail. It‚Äôs also easier to cut too much which is painful. You wanna be careful not to cut down to the quick. If there‚Äôs any blood, you cut too short and fucked up!
That looks more like an aggressive cat and a dog who is afraid. 

Doesn't look awww to me, in the cute way. 
what kind of neglectful person lets their dogs nails get that long
Clip your dogs nails

Why don't you defeat those claws. They get too long and it can cause arthritis in the long run.

What a pretty dog!

No comments on those wonderful heart eyes? Beautiful. 
he got some long nails
Why is the cat wearing socks?
Read OP's message about the nails. Isn't it true that the "blood vessels" also grow longer when you don't trim them? So if he's going to trim the nails at some point there's going to be so much blood :(
Clip your dog dude. Geez 
I'm a Cat Person and even I was happy to see such a good boy handing bad kitty his furry butt. I hate when cats do that to dogs.
Please, please, please look in to a different vet for your dog. The fact that they didn't provide you with anti anxiety solutions and told you not to worry about it is troublesome. I'm truly amazed they saw those nails each and every visit and thought it was okay. I definitely would not trust them caring for your animals moving forward. 
Maaan... dogs are such kind creatures, cats on the other hand are so damn mean, how could anyone like cats more than dogs
you need to walk your dog more, or cut it's nails
Please cut your dogs nails.üòí
For goodness sake, clip that dogs nails!
ITT: so many people saying "nails". Dogs don't have nails my dudes. Those are claws. There are several differences, but the most relevant one here is:

>Claws contain nerves and blood vessels, while nails do not. That's why a dog's claw will sometimes bleed when it is cut short, and it is also sometimes why dogs cry or pull away during claw trimming.

It's not just that your dog dislikes the trimming process, it may well be in pain.

The dog needs a manicure or a very long walk. 
Your dog seems super awesome please consider trimming its nails because it causes a great deal of discomfort to your pet when the nails/hooves are too long. Your dogs nails are way to long. Unacceptably so. Other dogs wear their nails off by running. Just saying, no upvotes here.
cats are assholes
My Dalmatian lost his eye to our cat like this. Be careful please.
Cats are JERKS

I just do NOT see enough dalmatians anymore. Our neighbor has a new pup and I've been dying to go over and snuggle it. 

Unfortunately, the neighbor is not a very nice person so I doubt I'd be allowed to snuggle her pooch
Add another litter box and this behavior will stop almost instantly. Cat is territorially insecure. Rule of thumb is 1 more liter box than the number of cats you have. I was shocked how much the extra liter box stopped all the bad behavior in the house.
Cats suck, Dogs rule!
Holy cow, cut that dog's nails.
Does that dog get to go outside?  Look at the length of its nails!
Cats just tryna tell your dog his nails need trimming.
Next trip to the vet, ask if they can trim that beautiful dalmatian's nails! Usually it's free!
Nails need a snippy snippy
Cut your dogs nails.. damn
Cut yo dogs nails 
Dude! It's like $10 for a groomer to trim its nails if your are too lazy (which it looks like)

Seriously, trim the dogs nails.
What you need to do is clip those nails
Jesus that is one hostile cat. I wanna know what's going through it's head to attack that dog for no reason 
How is that aww? Your pets aren't getting along it seems?
Sorry, I‚Äôm gonna be the one to say it: trim your dog‚Äôs claws, holy hell
Am I the only one that thinks his nails are WAAAAAY too long?
I think the cat was just trying to tell him he needed a goddamn manicure
All I could stare at was the dogs nails. Good lord invest in some clippers you barbarians. 
What‚Äôs wrong with the dog‚Äôs toe nail?
Dog and cat interactions are too funny to me. I'm always picturing the dog screaming inside their head. Please don't tell at me or hurt me, cat.
This is my yard now
Can someone add that washing machine sound that was very intense in the background?
No sound?

I was just waiting for the low, growly meow at the beginning.
This was awesome
You don't START nuffin, dere won't BE nuffin!
I like the way your dog looks over at you for permission to take just one bite to end the taunting your cat is giving ...
They both seem like they have very animated personalities.
That was a fair fight. 
I love how his tail is wagging during the counter attack. 
could‚Äôve streamed this shit on pay per view better fight than McGregor/Maywedduh
"I'm touching you.  Eat are you gonna do about it?"

Everyone with a sibling has been in this situation....
Better than injustice 2.
VICTORY SNIFF!
I just have to ask - is the bully a female cat? Our 3 y/o German Shepherd is terrified of the 9 y/o grumpy old lady cat we inherited last year when my FIL's mother passed away. She (grumpy old lady) will chase the German Shepherd and attack her when she's playing with our other dog in the yard, and otherwise prevent her from walking through the pet door or hallway. And PS, I'm glad reddit hasn't seen my dogs' nails - it's a work in progress.
Why do dogs always get bitched by cats?
Pushes cat off couch. Looks around, "Where did he go?"
Turns out the bully was nothing but a pussy.....cat.
Did I spot a ferret cage? 
But is it ok?
This was intense.   
Push me far enough...
What the hell's up with the flair? Mods gone insane or just petty as usual?
I love how the dog looks at the camera like "I can do it, right?" before taking action. üòÇ

Have the same dynamic in my house. Careful, cats can blind dogs. I try to keep my kitties nails short just in case there‚Äôs a scuffle I can‚Äôt break up in time. 
r/youseeingthisshit
This is fabulous. 
I think the cat just wanted him to play. Then was like "I know how to get a reaction from him", then pretty much got what he wanted.
As a cat lover, I honestly wonder what compels cats to be the biggest douchebag to other pets, especially when they would get destroyed if it fought back. 
Do you know what breed of cat this is? He looks just like my Bobby. 
"I'm sick of your shit, small, angry dog!"
Good for him
Well you ever be able to leave the two of them alone?
/u/coloredstripes he‚Äôs a good boi 
I have that same couch. From rooms to go, right?
Ohmygod how cute. My dog and one of my cats are like this with each other and I find it so funny. Our dog typically makes those ‚Äútalking‚Äù noises while she pushes him away. 
My old car would go into the neighbors yard just to mess with their dog.
Cats are manipulative as hell. 
Love! And is that a King's Cage in the background? You must have birds. I am fairly certain I have the exact same cage. 
My pupper is also a scared, squirmy worm when it comes to having her nails clipped. I used to take her to the vet because I couldn't stand to do it myself.
 Finally came up with a cheaper option. It's a 2 person job. One person holds a spoonful of peanut butter for the sweet good dog and the other one quickly clips off the sharp nail tips.
Works every time.
Good luck with that beautiful dog and your entertaining, asshole cat. 
 Beautiful doggo
Hahaha I cheered out loud for the pup. Nice one bud!
Always starting shit.
OP get your dogs claws clipped.
Yay doggy
r/justiceserved
Their expressions on their faces are great.
Way to go, Pongo!
One can always spot the non-walked dog by the dog's nails length.
please stop supporting this god awful video player until they fix it. Use youtube. It literally wont play. 
Can somebody please tell me who moved first at :35? It looks like they moved exactly at the same time. I imagine one is reacting to the other, but I can't figure out which. Unless their reaction is really that fast.
That dalmations claws are long enough to eff shit up 

With those claws dog can deafeat anyone and everyone

I'd love to watch it but v.reddit never actually loads for the viewer.
Because I am a Dalmatian and therefore probably blind?
That dog is so pretty

So good to see the dog stand up against the cat for a change! Oddly satisfying, one might say.
‚ÄúAre you seeing this shit?‚Äù - Dog
That is one fricken adorable good boy and a hilariously mean cat

YOU GO DOG!!!!!
Good boy! 
He has turned a corner, got past his first milestone on the road to world rule- first the cat then the world!
I wonder if animals have the ability to have a sense of humor. Like what else could explain this behavior? The cat wanted to fuck with the dog but it didn‚Äôt seem to actually see him as threat even though it was smart enough to know not to actually keep fucking with the dog, and both are like whatever in the end.
I love this. 
Dog "Mooooooom, kitty is being a dick."  
Mom "I know a certain kitty who is sleeping with mommy tonight"
I felt so bad for that spotty boy when he got attacked. Maybe kitty will think twice next time. 
LMAO. That was so cute.
Nice
why care some cats just huge douchebags for no reason
Does that dog have hearts on his/her/Zim/Zer? 
Taking kindness for weakness 
HAHAHAHAHAHHAA
The pupper gave the kitty plenty of chances to knock it off and kitty kept doing stuff with a look of, ‚ÄúWTF are you going to do about it?!‚Äù
It was so sweet and cute and precious at first, but then cats are such assholes
