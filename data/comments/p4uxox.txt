*Mission Impossible theme plays*
Our dog does this. She knows she not to be in the kitchen when someone’s cooking; and somehow her toes always seem to “accidentally” cross the invisible line. Lol. And then the rest of her follows slowly and inevitably.
They did leave the door open!
In my house we call this "slithering" lol
Forbidden rooms have the best carpet. He technically never walked in the room! Is there a loophole he found?? So cute.
Stealth and then FUN MODE ACTIVATED
This is hilarious. I sneak in. Then I CELEBRATE!
Good Evening, Canine 47.

Your main objective is the infiltration of the bedroom upstairs designated as the "No No Room".

It is often described as a play area of sorts for powerful human beings known as children. There, they live a lavish lifestyle of fun and games with no worries. They often rest there as well via an activity known as "Night-Night" when they're tired.

Your secondary objective, leave your scent on as many items and surroundings as possible without detection. This will make it so that future infiltrations are much easier and serve as a deterant to other nefarious agents such as Feline 77 or Hamster 69.

Tertiary objective, play with as many toys as possible. This is so you can confirm that all toys present are of a high enough quality as to not pose a risk to the unawares inhabitants known as children.

You have your objectives. Good Luck!
And he's trying to get the scent of the off limits room on his body!  That way he can take the off limits room with him everywhere!
He just NEEDED the to room to smell like him lol. My mom's dog has to touch the laundry before she puts it away so it can have his scent on it.
What dog? I didn't see anything.
That forbidden carpet hits different.
The best part is him rolling for the joy of having broken the law
*THERE'S SO MUCH MORE ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES!*
Someone needs to add the Mission Impossible theme song.
One of my dogs does this they army crawl into rooms they aren't allowed in
He was just scratching his balls
Mission imPAWSible.
Looks like he is trying to avoid the invisible detection lasers, Mission impawsible style
“I am stealth”
“MUST LEAVE MY SMELL IN FORBIDDEN DUNGEON”
Breaking the law! Breaking the law!



Barking the law! Barking the law!
"The secret ingredient, is CRIME"
LMFAO this is hilarious. Look at the way he creeped in lol
My dog likes to test the waters one foot at a time while staring at us
“METAL GEAR”
So precious!
Gotta get that new baby smell
If he can't have the room, he's rubbing his balls on it when no one's watching.
My dog rolled like this at a fair yesterday and the person who saw it decided to tell me that the reason they do it is because an odor is so good it is practically orgasmic And I hate them for telling me this
sneak, sneak, sneak

Ahhh... powdered baby smell, powdered baby smell, powdered baby smell,
FUCK YO COUCH!!!
K9 in action...oops..sorry break time!
Agent 47
"It's Jason Bourne.."
Why do dogs make that move?
He is so dang cute!
Mmmmmmm forbidden scratches
I guess sneaking into a room is cuter than scratching his dick on the carpet.
Dogs marking his scent to wars off monsters. Gotta protect the baby
Super sneaky!
The dog is doing the Snoopy dance on its back
I love when dogs crawl around like. So cute!
I think the dog was just itching.
Forbidden scratchies!
I had “Don’t be suspicious” in my head as he crawled
Just so sweet
The carpet is much cleaner in here!  lol
Very silly
*mission impossible music plays in his head* Woof woof woof woof woof woof woof woowowoooof
Woof woof woof woof woof
Owner probably said : ypu are not allowed to “go” in there. He just followed literally
Fucking hell i thought there was a baby hanging on their stomach on fence of that crib.
Diss mine now
Literally if any other animal was able to just rub his shit all over the place everyone would be calling this disgusting.  Dogs are so dirty.
Can he walk?
I bet there is urine or diaper smell in the carpet where the dog is rolling.  Maybe not a strong enough smell for humans, but the dog knows.
I wanted to see him crawl out the same way he got in 😭
He rolled on that forbidden floor
A Yiihss! This is the good life!
My dog tries this, but my cats tattle on her lol.
I am a undercover spy shh
Just need to overlay the mission impossible theme now
*[Mission Impossible theme plays]*
Hes rubbing his scent all over the baby room
Going under puper
haha i sneaky i mark my territorryyy
Smooth criminal
Brought this to mind:

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UTbd96J47eI
*lemme just rub my scent in here yeah baby*
Wow, Agent47
entrapment! the door was left open
Sneaking in, partying and owning it!
We call the back wiggles doing the Bat Dog lol
But this room smells like my favorite person!

-Dog, probably
he is part of the PAW PATROL
Ninja Doggy!
The the goodest of the bad boys
Doggy rolling around on the carpet once it’s in is fucking hilarious lmao
i had a hard day at work today and i when i saw that lil pup dragging himself across the floor i actually started crying this is the sweetest thing
That dog is so unbelievably derpy and cute ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Getting some forbidden scent rubbed on my back and nobody will know lol
Dont act Suspicious, Dont act suspicious, Dont act suspicious.. Dammit I rolled over
My mom's minpin used to do this.
Look how soft this piece of carpet is. It’s so wonderful. I’m so happy.
Our dog does this. She knows she not to be in the kitchen when someone’s cooking; and somehow her toes always seem to “accidentally” cross the invisible line. Lol. And then the rest of her follows slowly and inevitably.
Looks like a Metal Gear Solid mission
The pup wants that baby smell all over their own body.
Operation belly drag is a go
Ahh the forbidden carpet feels soooo goooood
Wait why is it off limits? He can’t be in his brother/sisters room when they aren’t there? I’m sure there’s a sappy video of dog brother welcoming new baby brother or sister into the world. But dog brother can’t go in there? Booo. Dog brother mad.
Is it just me or did everyone hear the mission impossible theme while watching him sneak?
Now I need a video of them showing this video to the dog to see it’s reaction.
Fuck Your Couch!!!
Oh my god I love him
Dog, Dog, DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOG!!!!!!!!!!
scent marking the baby's room. 

dog thinking "this room, too, is my pack territory"
That little naughty shit
You should let the pup in there!
That kid’s jeans hanging on the side of the crib sent me into panic mode
Looks like someone may have just had a bath
Rubbing his balls everywhere on the way in
This could be our dog, she has an identical crawl. I'm willing to bet good money that the carpet in that room is either new or more plush than elsewhere and that dog is belly-crawling in there for the scritches...
SECRET AGENT DOGGO
forbidden fruits are always sweeter
What da dawg doin?
My dog does this. He has earned the name ‘carpet worm’. Sometimes when we’re feeling more formal, we instead refer to him as the ‘four-legged fuzzworm’.
I would give an arm and a leg to enjoy life as half as this dog.
That tail wag says he knew exactly what he was doing
"If the baby can't smell me how will she know I love her?"
This is definitely a “Baby Needs To Know My Scent” situation.
He wants to smell like the baby so family remembers he is their baby too
Nothing gets me like dogs knowing they're being naughty. Funniest thing ever.
We had huge st Bernard. He would sleep... But slowly and visibly crawl over the living room line haha
Now any other dog that passes by will smell her and know that room and it’s baby are protected.
I love that it thinks as long as it was in the same position as it was laying by the door that means they're less likely to get caught
This is hands down the most adorable thing I’ve seen in a very long time! ❤️❤️
The absolute joy of doing something you shouldn't
Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, WIGGLE!!!!
"WOOOOO! I'M IN HERE, BITCH! I'M FUCKIN IN HERE!!!!!!!!!"
Dog- imma get my stank alllll up in here.
After waking up this morning and reading news about Kabul falling to the Taliban, Seeing this made me smileeeeeeeeeeeeee
That forbidden room flavor
r/AnamalsBeingDerps
What da dog doin
The doggo was so happy with itself
stealth mission
The Crib. A forbidden frontier. 
I tried to picture clusters of toys as they moved about the room. What did they look like? Bones? Animals? Were the drawers like toys dispensers? 
I kept dreaming of a world I thought I’d never see. And then. One day...
I got in.  

*Sudden electronic tones*
My dog knows she‘s not allowed in my mom‘s bedroom, especially not on the bed. I really dislike my mom (she‘s a toxic person, like really bad) so whenever she‘s not home I let my dog into her room and she will get zoomies and jump around the room super happily. It‘s my form of reparations.
I'm bitterly disappointed in this comment section. I'm seeing far too few Metal Gear references.
IT SMELLS LIKE BABY IN HERE WHOOOOOOOO WEWEWEWEEEEEE YEEEAH!
The dog like hehehe there will never know that I’m here
What happiness!!!!
Getting the sneaky smells
Ahh yissss back scritches from the forbidden carpet
That dogs' like..haha I made it, now I'm going to celebrate 🍾, carpet angels 😇
Do yourselves all a favor and watch this again, but play the mission impossible theme music while you do. Youre welcome.
Diaper pail right next to the crib where the kid can smell it….that’s some passive aggressive parenting.
I can hear the Mission Impossible music playing.
Fleas, fleas  . . .
Think of how many shit-stains there must be on their carpet
My dog isn’t allowed upstairs. But the big brute will get scared of thunder and sneak upstairs to my kids room and sneak under the bed in a thunderstorm.

The next morning, he will try to make it back down before I see him. But it’s pretty funny waking him up upstairs hiding and he will first be like, “oh, hay dad.” Then it will dawn on him and he will look embarrassed and sprint down stairs. Funny dog.
Uh, are we sure it's really sneaking or just scratching its body because it has fleas?
If you don't get their respect this is not the only thing they'll keep doing. It's cute, but yes, lazy trainer alert
Well I'm convinced some dogs use their scent to troll. They just don't realize we don't smell as well as them.
Aww he wants to smell like the baby
Your dog may have a skin condition
HE SAID SCREW YOUR CARPET!!!
Silly hoomans just thought it was off limits.
Another reason I'll never have a pet while in the U.S.
[removed]
All joking aside, no, it looks like your dog has a skin condition with all the rubbing on the carpet. May want to get him checked out.
This is definitely “Ahh…baby smell!” Baby must be out of the house.
ok so keeping a pet like a cat or dog off limits from say the childrens nursery is stupid unless said animal has behavioural issues.

my parents had the pets involved (at the time 2 lovely black cats called Wooster and Jeeves and my grans grey puff ball called Smog) taught my sister and me how to handle animals quite well.

it also taught the animals how to spot a kid that was safe, they would let you know if you were not safe to go near by walking away or hissing and if your corner them they will scream and scratch.
my dog is allowed in any room in the house however she wont enter without approval for some reason she will literately sit at the door line to a room or these invisible lines shes created form the kitchen and living room and wait till you say come in even though we've never restricted her from any room. I always go upstairs and she just looks at me waiting for the come on in nala call lol such a little dunce cap with manners. if you dont notice her waiting their she will tap her paws on the floor louder and louder till you realize lol
Best carpet in the house.
Why do I hear the mission impossible theme song in my head! Lol
My boy went full on Tom Clancy Splinter Cell Chaos Theory on the kids room
So wholesome, lol
he looks exactly like a bear at the beginning
Sometimes it feels so good to be bad.
❗️
Sneaking into an off limits room or just dragging an itchy belly on the carpet into a room in the house with video surveillance?
Baaaad to the boone, baba baba baba baaaad, babababababaaaaad!
“Omg this carpet feels so much better than the living room carpet”
&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|LYJLrM8VkBmyCKOd1O)
That’s the crack room for him haha
And as punishment he was blinked out of existence.
Better call Paw Patrol
This dog looks so much like my childhood dog and he also used to "battle crawl" his way across the carpet. So cute.
Picture of guilt ❤
The old man's dog from Family Guy...
Have a door gate by now?
So cute lol
Someone needs to add security lasers and Mission Impossible music to this!
No room is off limits for this sneaky boi.
☺️
Isn't he just scratching *it*
If I walk like that smol hooman, Nobody will notice me.
Well at least that's all he did.
According to my late dog-in-law the house rules were pretty simple, no dog in the sofa or bed when a human was home.
Penis surfing doggo.
Aww yis… virgin carpet
He’s trained spy
I thought there was a baby reading the newspaper sitting on the crib…
Gotta get them free smells!
Too funny
What breed is this dog? My dog might be the same breed
Rolly roll roll
I saw the pants on the crib and thought the kid was hanging over it.
Please correct me if im wrong, but don’t dogs do this to itch their junk?
Well at least he didn't take a dump. My cat took a dump the first time she sneaked into my off  limit room.
Forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest
😄
!
Totally me in 1975 b/c we were forbidden from going in my parents’ room.
Don’t be suspicious audio plays
This has "Fuck yo couch" vibes
Lmfao definitely his victory dance after his successful infiltration😂
bottom right. \*he is watching you\*
That dog looks EERILY similar to my pup
"Colonel, I have infiltrated the newborn room"
Yeah but the carpet didn’t smell of him yet, he was protecting you from the invisible monsters obviously smh
They’re just like us, sneaking forbidden pleasures.
How cute! 😍 I had a dog that would so that off her pillow to try and steal food off our plates.
I’m really hating this guest thing
[“Dont be suspicious, don’t be suspicious. Don’t be suspicious, don’t be suspicious. DONT BE SUSPICIOUS, DONT BE SUSPICIOUS.”](https://youtu.be/TyEBeHvNJvE)
So funny! What a cutie!
Ninja crawl!
Little fucker actually thinks he's being sneaky hahahahahaha
Any chance this is from the distractable podcast?
That’s funny 😄
Itchy boi
I’m looking on my tiny little phone, so, is that a kid climbing up the end of the crib??
Stealth lvl:  150/100
 Ii
This man high as hell.
Sploot drag for the WIN
Doesn’t he see the camera?
Made my day
Okay Ethan, we know you'll never sneak into the vault that is protected. After we have dabidee dabidai
Me in metal gear solid 5
“He can’t keep getting away with this!”
‘Ahahahhaa take that humans!’
Buster is Busted!
What the dog doin?
This is what your roommates do when you aren't home
Ah,the dog version of Rick James at Eddie Murphy's house.
If i smells like the baby they will cuddle me like the baby
The audacity!
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED, BOSS.
Lmao too cute the victory rolls were awesome lol
Ok
Lovable durp
Stelph
He’s rolling in a spot the baby spit up on. Dogs like that stink.
He's not sneaking, his nuts itch
Lol he KNOWS he's not suppose to be in there
Forbidden scratches are the best scratches.
It feels so good to be bad
“No limits” room more like.
Oh that sick bastard! The dog knows EXACTLY what he's doing and it's absolutely adorable. You sick dog!
Fuck yo limits.
SUPERSPY!!!!
What the dog doin
The forbidden floor is the best floor
Forbidden fruit is all the sweeter
Totally mission impawsible!
Really cute 😍
Talk about being discreet…..
The carpet is always comfier
I just love the tail wagging as he entered the room lol
007 in action
I moved into a place a few months ago with brand new carpeting. My dog loves rolling around in all the “soft” places without foot traffic. No matter how much I vacuum the whole place he does this exact thing in corners, and even the closet!
The victory rolls though!!!
Reminds me of drop dead Fred and the poop smear scene
If he could give you the finger, he would.
i love dogs they are so cute
The tippy toes tho
So cute reminds me of my puppy 😭
Mmmm yeah, breaking the law feels soooo gooooood mmmm
This need metal gear solid music
What dog? I don't see any dog.
fvck! thus is so cute it hurtts!
Oh oh! Let me get my scent everywhere
My heart!!
I don’t mean to take away the cuteness but I think he is trying to scratch his ding dong
My sister’s dog does this if sister is in a bedroom or the home office, where the dog isn’t not permitted. She sneaks in a few inches at a time until she’s suddenly in Sister’s lap.
Dog “I must protect little human against other dogs. If room smells like me little human is safe”
By dog law that room has been claimed.
What dog?
Probably smells really nice.
Stealth mode activated
![gif](giphy|ha5EeXrfx3xxC|downsized)
Hilarious
You learn something new every day.
Gotta love that new baby smell
Omg sooo funny
I don't understand banning a pet from a room...their world is already limited to the size of your house and you're going to make it even smaller???
I love how he rolls on the floor, he's just savouring the fact he's managed to sneak in.
Is there a subreddit just for dogs doing that roll’y poll’y thing I love so much?
What a renegade scoundrel!
Cute and I loved his happy dance at the end.
Thought bubble: 
“smell more like baby, they get more attentionies”
Sneaky bastard!!
NEVER. TOUCH, MY, DRUMSET.
This is how I am when I wake up at like 4am craving a snack. xD
More like wiping his privates across the kids carpet
That dog is adorable 😂
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
Did anyone else think the baby was just draped over the cot? 😂😂
'barko 6, going- ooh scritches'
<I'm in your room, timmy>
My dog just pees on the carpet when she escapes
Imagine the smell-explosion in the dog’s brain
Yeah? You don’t like me shedding in here?!?! Well who’s the sucker now?!?
Sneaking? Lol he's just wiping his dick on your carpet
The dog got a good way of scratching hinchy spots.....not sneaking 😂
Why is this sooo adorable.
Watching this on a loop right now.
Dang front paws always gettin’ the back paws in trouble!
They just need a good carpet to get their scruff on.
He’s just retaking his baby room
Mission passed   Respect +
Lol😂😂😂
I love the sneaky-sneak crawl into the room and the the wallowing around in there to make it smell all puppy-like up in there! That’s so damned cute!!! 🥰
*Sneak 100*
 Dog be like Im am one with the ninja
SNEAKY BOI
When I worked on retain, there was client that when arrived would tell hid Golden Retriever, Max, to stay at the door. Max knew he couldn't get up until his owner came back, so he would sneak like that into the store to get a look on his owner. Dog's logic I guess. Like my dog using her paws on the floor to "pull" the window  sunshine.
The sheer ecstasy of success…
What a cute pupper. He isn't hurting anything and there are no kids at risk. I think hes adorable
Too funny 😂
“Look me at me you little bitch!!…. Who’s gonna stop me now” ( proceeds to roll around on the carpet)
what the dog doin?
![gif](giphy|dGJ81LuuTSO0U)
Why do dogs do the little floor rubs? Lol my best friends Aussie will walk in her room, rub herself down on the rug and just walks out. It makes me laugh every time. But I still don’t understand it
Too funny 🤣😂
Starts squirming about " awwww yisss"
oh...forbidden room! YAY!!!
 ¨Two and a half paws don’t count.¨ could’ve been anyone.
I used to take care of a —- blanking on breed but huge dog with huge hanging face flaps that are constantly dripping slobber. Starts with an M — that had its own leather chair.  Nobody else sat on it because it was the slobber chair.    Edit: mastiff
i thought there was a baby hanging over the side of the crib omg
For some reason i thought they were imitating a baby with that crawl as if that got them access
What dog?
Wasn't this the video about dog so *happily* trying to get the smell of the baby's puke in its fur?
Omg! Our dog looks and acts just like that!
Sticking it to the man
Very cute. Ours runs in and grabs something and darts out as fast as possible
Dogo has no limits.
Imagine if the elmo moved.
The carpet in there is just so much better for scritchy-wiggles
Silly dog 😂
My scent isn't in here. Let me fix that says dog.
Fuck you Karen. I'm gonna put my nutsack on your drumset.
Wait, what dog?  There is a dog sneaking in the room???  Hmm, sometimes dogs do a slinking, low crouching thing so no one sees them.  Maybe that happened here--I only see a baby room.
Bad Dog
A cat would just waltz in and take a nap. Then look at you when you scold it.
He wiggle :3
The oh so stealthy army crawl?? Followed by a well executed victory wriggle!!?? 😍
10/10 the most cutest pupper 👏👏👏👏
I don't understand, if u have a pet and it's stay home with you 24/7 why would have need for limiting its mobility at your home creating off limits and this and that?
My dog did something similar. We had a big storm that wrecked part of our fence. It took a couple of weeks before the fence people could come out and fix it. I jerry-rigged the part that was broken so my dog couldn't escape but she figured out a way. One day I notice she wasn't in the back and went out. I look over and she is in our neighbor's yard, paws in the air, rolling on her back.
the same reason my housemate’s cheese is not safe.
Pleasuring his privates on the rub more than sneaking.
Bad Boi !
Even dressed in black for the capper.
Awwwwyeeeeeah….
forbidden floor
He's just getting room ready with his stank.
Such stealth!!!
What dog?
I set up a baby gate for my tiny chihuahua, she found out she can jump it now
My dog isn’t nearly that stealthy
was so happy to be there, he had to do some back zoomies.
He crawled in incognito, doesn't count. Lol
🤣🤣🤣
Stel
This butter biscuit….
where?
It’s the thrill of the possibility of being caught
Army crawl past the sentries.........shhh
Dog
Why would this be an off limits room?

Baby's room just hits different.
Stealth mode 👌🏽

We call this the watermelon crawl in our house. Our dog does it when he goes ExtraLongBoi and drags himself across the carpet while frog style on his belly
He gotta get his hair in that nice clean carpet
he needs an handheld radio

"BSSHHHTH ... i'm reaching destination ... BSSHHHHTH"

"WOOF"

"what?"

"i mean: roger"

I need MI theme for this video.
That tail wagging the whole way
Humans don't deserve dogs lol
Aww, you should just let em in there.  Poor dogo just wanna tha baby's frand.☹
Metal gear alert plays
You can just hear him singing the mission impossible theme to himself while he scoots
This guy is so cute!
It’s disturbing to me that that dog looks 100% like my dog idk why tho
So that's what our dog does when he goes into the kids off limits room
This dog just went in there to bathe in his rebellion lmao
Double 007 🙌
No room should be off limits.  
What happens if the baby has a problem or the dog smells something in the baby's room?

About 5 years ago my sisters pitbulls weren't allowed in the baby's room,  then one night around 3am  my sister sees and hears the dogs barking on the baby monitor,  they're in front of the crib. she rushes in and my niece had stopped breathing. 

My niece was 8 months old, she called 911 and they were able to get her breathing again.
Now my niece is 5 and those dogs have always been by her side.  Especially at  bed time. 💜.
He’s teabagging the floor
He’s putting his scent so no other animals trespass
Mission Impossible theme followed by a Murmurs song
Hahaha, it’s like when the tiger is out, the monkey is the king😂
My heart is melting reading all these sneaky dog stories
What a rebel!
He just needs that baby smell
The dog just wanted to roll on the carpet
He's so pleased with himself...
The sheer joy of breaking the rules getting the doppamine rush of something which is off limits. 🥰🤗
Ninja dogs or shadow woofs.
it probably has the best rug
that's pretty gross.
its just way to cute !!
"Caption this"
Operation....
At least it didn’t drop a deuce in there.
omg he looks like an inchworm wiggling
Adorably sneaks into the tool just to roll on the floor. I love dogs so dang much. To make it so much better. The dog was literally army crawling!!! It's like dogs get cuter and cuter the more you look at them!
Mine sneaks into my room to poop or pee. Annoys me to ko end. He also rubs himself over my main head pillow.
Excellent sneaking technique!!
Excuse my language but;

Dog: "Fuck yo couch!"
We had well-trained our English Pointer mix to not go into the dining room, ever. She would just sit quietly in the doorway watching everyone. Then, if she behaved, she knew she'd get a treat of a decent sized bite of the meat served at dinner. (Before any nay-sayers say that's not healthy-- our dog lived a healthy life until she passed away at 17! That is-- "people years"!)

Anyways, as she got older, she still would sit outside that doorway, but would put just the tips of her paws in the doorway. I guess she just wanted to be sure that the floor in there felt like the rest of the house? Or maybe she wanted to feel like she was a part of the fun we were having in there. 😍
What a little stinker! 🤣🤣
Sigh.

It’s year 2021 and we’re still uncomfortable admitting a) dogs act guilty when they expect to be punished, 2) that’s not good, and) we’re too lazy to teach the dog an alternative to do instead of the behaviour we don’t want.


Oh and also, I’m gonna get downvoted for this.
Why would the dog not be allowed into the kid's room? 

Seems like a nice dog? 

Maybe the kid is a jerk?
How old is your child? You should really stop recording and give them the gift of privacy if they're at least 6 months old.
I think i came
There's NOT a kid in this video.
I’m pretty sure ur dog has worms or flees
