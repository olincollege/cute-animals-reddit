My lord that is a cute baby bunny. Its head is practically the same size as its body...
Baby buns are the cutest! 
I'll save this picture and look at it whenever I'm sad
I showed my 8 year old and she was so overwhelmed by the cute she could only make incoherent squee noises.
I saw Monty Python and the Holy Grail, I know what he's capable of.
There's a second bunny in the background!

Looks like a mix between a rabbit and a squirrel. Squirlbit
Looks like a cross between bunny and chipmunk. I shall call it a

It's a nidoran! Catch it! 
I can't decide if this is a long-eared squirrel or impossibly cute rabbit.
Muad'dib?
Completely against my will, when I opened this picture, I said "IT'S A BUNNY!"
I once found a baby bunny my cat chased behind a flower pot. We got the cat away, and it seemed he only was able to bite a hole into the bunny's ear. Aside from being scared shitless, he seemed okay, so after a few minutes of petting him (and taking pictures of the cute little thing), we dropped him off by a big bush nearby our house that some other rabbits like to hide in. I saw him later once he grew up, and still noticed a mark on his ear.
Smol bun :D
DEFEND IT WITH YOUR LIFE!
It's a bunny-squirrel....
Oh fuck that's cute.
SHOW ME WHAT YOU GOT
That's cuteness and beyond. Be safe little one
Too small too cute
Oh hi tiny bunny!
I've seen the most uber cute shit on snapchat, ie my wife in a bunny suit.
We have a wild rabbit just like that one but it was a baby last year and she's growing fast and occasionally comes up to the area where we broadcast chicken feed for our flock of house sparrows.  She hops up and runs a bit in circles to get the birds to scatter and then she tucks in for some corn and other tasty bits in the mix.  Later we see her munching on dandelions and other tender shoots to get some moisture content in her belly.  Lately we've seen her stretched out on the lawn in the shade relaxing after her meals, so it seems she sees our property as her home now and we couldn't be more pleased with her addition to our 'flock'.  We think she is a girl based on how dainty she is about eating and hopping around.
Until it grows up and has more rabbits and they eat your garden.
Cute, until it starts eating my plants

Him near those car tires is making me super anxious
I know those cars are parked but that makes me nervous!
I don't know what all you've taken pictures of, but I believe you're correct. This is the cutest thing you've ever taken a picture of.

Baby bunny. Just saying it makes you feel good.
King bun!
what kind of dog is this? 
CUTE :) 
It's a "Squirabbit"
I ran one that looked like that over a month ago with a lawnmower. Luckily one of them hopped away, but one didn't. 
I also ran one over a few years ago with a lawnmower. I cleaned it up, gave it water, and called around until I somehow found a lady that helps wild rabbits. Took it to her the next morning and she saved it. She emailed me a couple weeks later and told me it was doing great.

Anyway, watch out for patches of dead grass. One of these was in 2 ft grass, another was in 3-4 in grass. And I no longer do landscaping.
Nayeon looks great here
A family of bunnies lives on my property. Many times I see baby bunnies hopping around, and sadly sometimes they die from other animals, which is so sad to see. Imagine waking up to see a dead baby rabbit on your front lawn.
Prepaire the holy hand granade!
It's just a single exhaust system..?
Be gentle, Lenny. 
Is that a squabbit?
Well, you never took a picture of me, so...
What a cute exhaust üòçüòç
That thing reminds me of Stitch. 
Bunbun! 
Not sure if squibbit or rarrel.

Half rabbit, half chipmunk. All cute. 
It's Stitch!

"What year is it?!"

Where can I kidnap one of these?
It's the most kitten looking bunny I've ever seen 
Ahh a young Peter Peter nickle eater
Squabbit?
This is refreshing. After seeing shit like r/awwwtf, and other messed up weird subs, its nice seeing a baby bunny not chewed up or something. Thanks for brightening up my day
Get him to some bushes! He's hawk food out in the open like that. =(

Don't like selfies much?

So so so so so Cute !!! 
My goddamn idiot cat brings us these things in its mouth.
It's a baby Squabbit!
I was your 7380th updoot
I'd be too scared to hold in fear of cuddling it too hard.
Besides yourself! :D
How much did you hope he didn't move? On a scale from 1 to 'don't move or I'll cry'
Name him Buster!

This is the cutest thing I'm gonna kill this week 
My cat routinely kills these
Squirabbit?
So, hopefully you don't mind but, I saved this picture and made a little meme of it! It's just too cute not be a meme!
Reminds me of Easter many a year ago...

I have a family dog, a little rat terrier breed we named Levi.  We brought him to my aunt's house for Easter because he turns into a wreck even after just a few days in a kennel.

So my aunt had just fenced in a garden in her backyard, nice and deep and rabbit-proof.  Only problem is, she managed to fence an entire family of rabbits *inside* the garden.

Now rat terriers are fairly intelligent dogs, and killing small animals is what they were bred for - so we told my cousins "whatever you do, don't point at the rabbits, or Levi will see them".  That dog traces fingers really well, and he was nearby at the time.

Well my youngest cousin forgot (she was maybe 4 at the time) and pointed at them... Levi was over that fence in a flash.  3 of the 4 babies were done for before we were able to grab him, maybe 5 seconds later.

We were able to save the last bunny and reunite him with his mom outside the garden, but my little cousin still remembers the day that "Levi killed the Easter Bunny".
Your photographic device does not appease me human.
Bring me a carrot.
It's a picture of a bunny... 
And half a second later it's gone... those fluffy balls sure are fast fleeing 
This reminds me of the time a baby bird was hiding behind my sisters car tire. Right as I went out to tell her to not drive off she unknowingly backed over the bird and crushed it :( 
I had a similar experience https://imgur.com/OJXR0yg
Baby rabbits are one of the cutest things on the planet. 
Looks like a monopoly piece
What kind of dog is this?
Babby used tackle.

A critical hit!
I love it how we humans have evolved a urge for protecting cute things. I'm constantly saying "PROTECT IT" in my head as I look at that wonderful picture
As someone who used to live in front of a veritable bunny factory there's a hawk somewhere nearby watching this little guy. I guarantee it
A wild Nidoran‚ôÇ appeared!!!
Big head
This is the cutest picture I've ever taken. 
Don't let it fool you! [That rabbit's dynamite ](https://youtu.be/XcxKIJTb3Hg) 
I remember when I was maybe 9 or 10, my dog killed a baby bunny about this size. Chased it around and crushed its skull with one bite. I was so bewildered. I walked over to it to see if I could help it. I distinctly remember the indention on its head and its body rising and falling with large breaths. Then it stopped. 
She's too young to be out in broad daylight alone. I hope you swished her off to the bushes for safety. 
whats up with baby bunnies these days? dam things are screwing around alot
Literally squealed out loud upon seeing this
What'd you use for the picture? It's got some nice zoom 
2 cute 
Big head model, rabbit, level 2 critter
It's looks like a Squabbit
Never seen a baby bunny, you brightened my day, she is adorable!!!
Aww post that actually made me aww
Oh my, that it the definition of cute! 
I have a litter of these growing up under my back porch. Dog doesn't mind them because she grew up with my ex-wife's pet rabbit; Oreo, a dutch/lionhead. Cute little bastards but if I didn't have a second floor front patio garden they'd be toast. Or stew...
I've only been in America about six years and I'm still amazed there's actually wild rabbits hopping around.

*Just like in the movies oh my gosh*.

I'm so used to the vermin of choice being squirrels every time I visited.
i love how his head is bigger than the rest of his body
Watch out for unexpected eagles. I've seen shit. 
I want it.
You mean your exhaust system?
Just like potato chips, you can never eat just one.
#SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
all this reminds me of is the many dead bunnies i see at my job :'(

oh sweet jesus... so fuggin FLOOF!
Rattata! Rattata!
Would make for a nice sandwich.

I'm just imagining mouse sized rabbits now 
When I was in the seventh grade, a bunny like this showed up at our bus stop. It's was all by itself and still blind. We took turns petting it, but before one of us could take it home to care for it, the bus arrived. 

By the time we came back it was in the grass, flat like a pancake, 2 feet away from where we found it. Dead. Traumatized me for weeks. 
Hope there were no birds of prey around... we all saw what happen to the last rescue on a driveway.
Oh my godddd
üòçüòçüòç
BIVO LOTTIE GOT MORE HEAD THAN HE GOT BODY. 
I thought it was a baby squirrel with abnormally long ears
*ohmygodohmygodohmygod*

That is *cute.*
How are baby rabbits any cuter than larger fluffier full grown rabbits???
Its body still needs to grow to fit the size of her/ his head. So cute!!
You should take more pictures of yourself in that case friendo.
My wife and I rescued a day or two old baby bunny from a Chihuahua and we tried to raise it we got all the stuff for it to survive, we watched it day and night it was getting stronger and started moving around we were so happy, he was making so much progress. Sadly he had a seizure while my wife was holding him and then he died in my wife's hand. She cried for the rest of the night. It was really sad. 
r/cottontails
I will name him George and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him and pat him and caress him on account of I love him!
LOOK AT HIS LITTLE FEET
Awesome, thanks for the cavities, that was too sweet.  That little thing is the cutest thing i've ever seen all day.

Here comes the bun woahoh. Here comes the bun and I say...
[KING BUN](https://xkcd.com/1682/)

in other news I happen to live in the only place in the city that has bunnies. 
Kittennnn!!!! 
I found one of those baby buns sitting in the middle of wildflower patch when I was a kid. Just sitting there, alone. It was like a scene out of Disney movie. I took it in, and my mom called the zoo to find out how to bottle feed it formula. It soon got big and rambunctious and very stinky. My mom put it out on the porch one day, which was sort of enclosed, but it escaped and we never saw it again.
Wow so smol, much cute :)
ITS SO FLUFFY IM GONNA DIEEEEE

Heed! Move!
my cat is in the habit of bringing demobilized baby bunnies to my front stoop, leaving them, then going and finding another one. I dont approve of his genecidical habit
I can't even with this smol bunner
His big fat head is adorable 
It's a squirrabit
I love rabbits but they are an absolute nightmare if you like to save a bit of money in the summer by maintaining a vegetable garden. They destroy and or eat everything, usually starting with expensive stuff like trees. 
Is OP in North Texas?  We have bunnies all over.  
Did your grandfather find it?
That bunnie's head is 'aww'fully big
Of all the shit I've seen in my 37 years, military included, when I run one of these over mowing the grass, it never gets any easier......hurts my heart for days!   
Thing had a big head haha
I took a photo of one that size about a week ago.  It was dead.
Officer hops.
I want  to throw a pokeball at it! And keep it forever
So cute,i hope it fucking gets ran off by a car.
Meanwhile in Illinois, I try to keep a baby bunny from pacing outside the fence and giving my beagle anxiety, he goes in a bush and instead of escaping, he runs in the yard, gets clipped by the beagle, screams,  then is hiding in my hot garage in the corner.   I didn't see blood when he ran by but I suspect his right leg was clamped on when he was running.  Garage is open and have no idea if he will come out as he will hide out of reach between the studs.
That is so incredibly cute!
Holy fuckin shit that's cute.

The Head to Body ratio. I love him.
^^^^^Bun
Great resolution too
It's so small I have a looming fear of it being stepped on or something. Can someone get that guy a shell or something?
It reminds me of the splice infant.
I love baby bunnies because they haven't had the fear of humans instilled in them, and so they're usually more comfortable with me watching them from afar (and taking pictures!).
My pup brought one of these in today........ he didn't look as cute by the time I got to him as this one :/
Thanks reddit!
looks like a Bunnysquirrel
Sweet baby angel!

Just had a baby rabbit get stuck in the window well of my room.  Cutest fucking thing ever.  Was shaking to death when I went down and grabbed it to get it out.  It's mom (I assume) was right near the window well.
That's not a picture of a mirror, though.
How many baby bunny pictures can we get on reddit in three days jesus

Clearly you are not yet a parent :)
Would you stomp on it for $1million though?

Until it eats your strawberry bushes at least!
Better hope you don't have any plants that you hold dear. Bunnies by me ate all the sunflowers I planted. 
Is that a Squirrel Bunny? A Squnny? A Burrel?

Did you help it find its way back to its nest after you took the pic?
It is so cute

That is one cute bunny
Based on the coloration, I thought it was a baby squirrel. Took me way too long to realize it was a bunbun.
Right inline with the RR tire :)
A lot of that is camera distoration
It's so cute I am going to die. 
Cute until it gets run over by the car
Is it breeding season up there? I'm seeing a lot of baby bunnies in my feed.

Do they bite?
My gf ran over a baby bunny of about the same size with a lawnmower.  Poor thing.  It somehow survived the chopped off ear...
I've never seen a bunny so small!! Lucky you
I live in the Mojave, these little guys are everywhere.  My cat loves bringing them into the house, alive, then plopping his ass on the cool tile and watching me chase after them.

Did you rescue it?
i crushed like three of these with my car on the way to work this morning. 
Funny looking pupper

Cute baby bunnies give me PTSD.... but that's a story for another time. 
Niantic really stepped up the graphics for Pokemon Go fest.
I saw this like 5 times tonight.... still the best! 
We have a ton of baby bunnies living on my street and in my alley/back yard. Adorable little buggers but you gotta drive carefully around there or they pull a Prometheus on you and run in a straight line away from you
I grew up in the country, and had a killing machine cat named Orlando furioso who would literally rip these guys heads off every spring, he had a knack of taking the whole spine out along with the head. We would try and keep him in the house but he'd escape and cue the rabbit shrieks (which are horrible) kinda traumatic 
Ahh, the elusive Chipmunk-Bunny-Squirrel.
My advice would be to NOT keep it and raise it as a pet.

So cute, Reddit upvotes to number one post of all time... in 11 hours.

Nothing much better than a baby bunny.

I've tried bunny meat for the first time yesterday. :(
And then moments later a hawk swoops it up.
All I see is something ny cat will eat.
FOR 10 MILLION DOLLARS WOULD YOU STEP ON IT
You've never taken a selfie? :)
That bunny is surprisingly fit.  All the bunnies I've had were obese balls of fluff.
Baby buns typically die after encountering humans/dogs/cats within 24 hours from capture myopathy.  Always leave baby buns alone.
As a hawk swoops down and grabs it.
The funny thing is to consider that these things basically just look cute to us to protect them. So they're basically the same kinds of assholes that everyone else is underneath, but their fur etc. hides that fact. Now to imagine that thing as it "really is". lol
Have you heard of a selfie? 
Looks like a fake head on a miniature dog, and exceedingly cute, too
That's a weird looking dog.
The luckiest of rabbit feet
Now eat it. 
**With Carrots, Potatoes and Leaks ... it would be even more cute** :-)

This is the cutest thing I've ever ran over.
Only until that car backs up. 
That's no ordinary bunny. That's Igor Santiago notorious heroin baron. He murdered 456 people using a banjo string and breath mints. The last guy who called him cute got skinned and used as a snuggie. He's wanted in 46 countries including Antarctica and he even bitch slapped Nancy Grace for suggesting he invest in mutual funds. That guy is extremely dangerous!
Now step on it
The car is actually backing up to run it over for Science

Whenever I see a rabbit these days I think about how good they taste cooked in their own fat.

NOW RIP ITS FUCKING HEAD OFF
It's gonna die soon. That's bird food.  
Is American bunny. Is ded now.
Down voted. Not the cutest thing. 
If you love animals, I hope that means you don't eat their dead bodies
even cuter without ecosystem-destroying engines in the background 
These pictures always make me so, so sad! With major anxiety I see it as, awww, it's so cute...wait, where's it's mum!? Wait! It's by a road! And then I proceed to be depressed until I can get it out my mind.

Seriously, it's a curse and I can't deal with it:(

I do hope it goes on to lead a long and carrotful life :(
That's cute? I thought that was roadkill in future tense. 
I like the second picture after the car rolled back...

I wonder if the car reversed over it.
looks tasty... 
 Took a cute photo of a bunny one day, the next day I didn't see him in the grass and ran him over with a lawn mower. #sadaboutit
That's what I said about my latest dickpic
I only get to see baby rabbits when my cat brings em by o_o
They taste just as good as they look...
That is one big effing lizard!
Yes it's adorable, but how did it taste?
Next to cars with big wheels that can...
Don't touch him. I indirectly got one killed by touching him )':
