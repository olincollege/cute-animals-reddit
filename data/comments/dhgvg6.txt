Maybe its a cuddlefish
"I see you have stopped. This is incorrect."
I've never seen a fish be that affectionate..
Fish is like we aint done here
You know why the fish did that? It's strange or is something common?
#thats a funny looking dog man
There is something out there that connects all of us in some way.
honestly this is exactly the content im on the internet for
I‚Äôd be more worried about the chompy boi swimming around in the back
I bet if a representative of every animal got together to discuss humans, they would have many interesting things to say. Some thigs maybe we might not want to hear. 


But then one of the animals would be like: " but scritches." And all the animals would be like: O MY GOD YES! SCRICHES ARE THE GREATEST!!" 

Our hands are just so amazing. I dont think there is a single animal that doesnt like humans touching them. Cheetahs got that speed, eagles fly, humans can put sharks to sleep with a belly rub and pull ticks off with perfect precision.
Welp. You're gonna need more oxygen. 'Cause your job is fish pets now.
I love how despite the direction all the other fish are swimming, Mr. Huggle Fins swims the opposite way when he sees his buddy...
Fish are friends not food
I swear, all these videos of fish liking pets and chickens giving hugs makes me feel really bad about my carnivore tendencies.
Are there erogenous zones on fish?

I ask because I learned they exist in birds after apparently spending many years of my childhood jerking my cockatiel off.  ):

edit: wow that was a weird sentence. sorry.
I‚Äôve never thought that petting a fish was actually an option.

When ‚Äúvegetarians‚Äù still eat fish because they don‚Äôt have feelings.
scientists are learning that lots of species of fish are much more intelligent than previously thought, blue planet II goes into it a little but ive also read about it in some posts on reddit. i wish i had the memory to cite some sources but new tech and observation methods theyve been observed using tools, remembering enormous patterns and areas in the ocean floor like us remembering streets in our cities, and even seemingly recognizing other individuals after long periods of time (months to even over a year). a lot of people are insensitive to them because they have a lack of expression or vocalization but if you ever have the opportunity to dive some will interact with you in very strange and unexpected ways.

Are cuddles a universal language?

For both the human and the fish.

Do Fish enjoy being scritched? Butt Scritches for fishes!
I've never been a little fish guy but if I could afford a huge tank like this I would totally get a huge fish friend.

They're just like little puppies.
Is that normal behavior or is that fish unwell or something?
Fish cuddle? I didn't know they wanted cuddles
Awwww!  Any fish keeper will tell you they have much more personality than people think!  Oscars especially, and other cichlids.  Loaches too!  Not sure what this big boy is, but they're amazing creatures that deserve love!
My drunk girlfriend almost started crying watching this video
Looks like a Nassau Grouper. Also known as the dogs of the ocean. I have met these animals in the wild and they are in fact cuddly!f
Fish are underrated. Nuff said
And they say fish don‚Äôt have feelings
Human beings can be so sweet. I wish that's what we saw for the most part out in the world. I wish this was the rule and not the exception.
I need a cuddle too.
TIL belly scritches are universally loved
Watching the air bubbles. The diver goes from super relaxed just doing the job to ‚Äúhey there buddy! Who‚Äôs a good fish? Who‚Äôs a good fishy fish???‚Äù
So there I am, trying to discreetly pee in my wetsuit, when this fish totally outs me.  I quickly recovered by acting like we were cuddling.
I never thought I‚Äôd wanna pet a fish???? Do they feel affection?
Well there goes my sushi appetite
Might be a stupid question, but do fish like getting petted? Like a cat or a dog would?
Wait, fish like to be touched????
It's a fish doggo!!!
I URGENTLY NEED TO KNOW WHERE I MAY SEE MORE FISHES GETTING SCRITCHES
A cuddlefish
It's amazing that humans who love to pet are on the same world as things that love to be petted
Bro, do fish actually like being pet like that? That's fucking awesome
What is this behavior scientifically speaking? Like obviously fish don't crave physical contact like people or say dogs do. They aren't nurtured by their mothers like petting mimics. I've seen other videos of fish doing this. Why?
Can someone explain the rules of this sub?

2 posts this past week made it to top where a dog appeared to be harming or killing a fish. I assumed those posts were cool because people don't care about fish too much, or less than other animals we eat as I suspect other videos showing animals harming other animals wouldn't make it here. 

Then I see this post where a guy is petting a fish. 

Is the idea those fish were wild and this one isn't?

I don't care either way just seems inconsistent to upvote a dog eating a fish and a man petting one so I was hoping somebody could explain it.

I had a pair of Clown Lochs for a couple of years since they were youmg and everytime I did tank maintenance, one would swim into my hand so I could rub his sides. Also, a puffer I had knew when I come home from work and hey excited when he saw me. Fish are interesting and super cool
I thought fish have bad memory.
I've never seen someone pet a fish before!

Dumb question, but do certain fish really like human contact?
Sadly only <1% of fish like cuddles. The rest just sorta *blub*

This is why it drives me mad when some pescaterians justify their choice by saying fish are stupid. They're really not.

Do fish like pats?
Dinner :D
Notice how the diver doesn‚Äôt even look down till the sharks have safely passed...
Yo this man is real shit petting a fish
Honest question here, do fishes and marine life respond to being pet like this? From my experience they don‚Äôt wanna be anywhere near people.
That is very sweet.
Who would've thought fish could be so darn cute?
Hey Biology reddit, is it just mean or does, "enjoys pets, scritches and cuddles," seem to be a highly conserved trait?

Aww that fish looked so lonely as he swam over with his sad little face.
It seems that it actually saw the diver and then rushed to him. This is so adorable.
There are sharks in the back...
He is swimming with sharks.
Well I'd cuddle up to the big human in that case too...

Cuddlefish ?
We have a fish right now who gets so excited to see us. He can be at the furthest corner of the tank and will swim up to the front of the tank as quickly as possible to greet us when he knows we're in the room and stays there until we leave. He gets so excited when we feed him that he will literally leap out of the water (which seriously startled me the first time he did it) or will squirt water at whoever is feeding him. I've never known fish to be so interactive but hes a really cool fish.
In the island of Bonaire, there is a dive instructor that has a special bond with a 2m Tarpon. It is quite the sight to see, when the fish puts his head under the divers arm, asking to be pet
I dont know about these things, im just a normal citizen not a scientist so maybe somebody who knows these things could tell me. Do Fish have feelings ? I can understand that they want to cuddle. I mean that feels good. Why wouldnt they want something done to them that feels good ? But isnt there a law by nature to not approach Things that are bigger and might eat you ?
... a fish dog?
Well this is a genuine first for me. üëç

Some fish enjoy getting petted because it gets stuff off their scales. It‚Äôs like scratching an itch

Unbelievable!!!!
Wow, u think you have seen it all. I didn‚Äôt think fish like being touched, that puts a new perspective on how fish feel and have emotions surely?
It bothers me that you can't really intuit where they like to be let and rubbed like you can with a dog or cat... A dog will come to your feet, plop down, and present his belly for some rubbins! But fish? The only way to find out is if they come back or not....

There‚Äôs a strict no touch policy where I work unless an animal is imminent danger (when a sea turtle got its flipper tangled in my hose). The animals don‚Äôt know this. We have one nurse shark that spent a good 10 minutes waiting for me to put my fins on the ground so he could come and put his head on them. It was adorable.
Can you stroke a fish?
This guy deadass pet a fish
the way it swam over made my heart melt
Makes me wonder if sea life enjoy touching/petting as much as land based life does, land based life is very touchy and petting I think is a pleasurable experience because it's close to scratching, and scratching often alleviates a discomfort, so I think petting gives that same relief.

But sea life from what I've seen isn't really touchy and I don't think they every scratch, granted they don't have limbs to scratch them self, they could still use soil, rocks or vegetation.
So real talk.

People who do jobs like this in Big Aquariums? How much of your job is you in the tank doing this kind of stuff and how much is you outside the tank?

This can't be true, right? Had a fish tank for 2 years, none of the fish showed any sign of affection or any intelligence. Wrong fish?

I‚Äôve always wondered, do fish like being pet?? Do fish pet each other?
Fishies like pets too?!
It's gotta be wild to be touched by a human. Does any other creature have the manual dexterity we do? I feel like him man touch must feel pretty unique to animals.
Aw what a sweet *Cat*fish

It's cuter when you watch it the second time and see him hauling ass over there.
This is going to sound weird. But is there any science or studies that have to do with fish getting rubbed bringing any sort of pleasure or enjoyment ?
Watch the fishys eyes as he slides up he's like omg hooman I'm gettin some rubs
TIL some fish like to be pet like a dog or cat
Well, today I learned that some fish love to be pet.

this isnt one of those fishes that is attracted to ammonia is it?

please nobody notice.
I.... I want a pet that affectionate
yesterday i (kinda) got to pet some fish. we went to this japanese friendship garden downtown and they had this massive koi pond there with a bridge over it. the bridge was low enough to where i could go up to maybe my second knuckle deep in the water and the fish were swarming around me and my sister was like "dude you should try to touch the fish" so i did. several of them were out of the water enough so i could pet their heads a bit with the backs of my fingers (so i didnt accidentally scratch them) and they kept coming up so i kept petting them. they felt kinda rubbery like a dolphin on the more fleshy parts of their heads.
Fish are friends, not food.
I wonder how intelligent they are compared to like a cat or something
Awwwwwww

Damn it bitches! These fishes need scritches!
Probably a dumb question, but don‚Äôt fish have to keep moving to get oxygen from the water? This fish was stopped for a while, so was it just ‚Äúholding its breath‚Äù for a really long time, or is the water being agitated because it‚Äôs an aquarium?
