He looks old enough to be a great-grandpa
Well that’s the cutest thing I’ll see all day. Time to get off reddit.
Surely there's got to be a great or two at the front of grandpa. Very sweet gentleman, who needs a cane when there's babies to cuddle ☺️
It's like Grandpa Joe throwing off the blanket and being able to walk again.
Wonderful beautiful perfect Welcome to Monday!   I want to hug grandpa!  Today I will hold all my grandpa’s in my heart and mind with love. 
My husband didn’t really have a dad growing up. He was really close with his grandpa. They were best friends. Our daughter was born 12 weeks early weighing in at 2lbs 8oz. The NICU in our area only allows a specified few people in to visit the babies and they must be on a list. We could only pick 4 so we chose his mom and step dad due to pressure from their side and my mom and sister. 

One day I get a call from a nurse and she’s frantic. She is apologizing over and over saying she may have made a mistake and let the wrong person visit our baby. My husband’s grandpa had gone in and introduced himself as “Grandpa” so she thought he was either my dad or my husband’s. After calming her down I told her I was more than happy he got to hold her. They took photos for us. He was 83 at the time. 

He passed a year later. I’m always so glad he snuck into that NICU. 

(And you might be hard on the nurses but they were amazing and caught the mistake immediately. They did nothing wrong.)

\- Grandpa, probably
Why does she touch his leg? 
“Nope. This is mine now. Get your own.”
This is the smile i needed this morning.

My dad literally got to hold my daughter one time before he passed away. His reaction was pretty much the same.

Thank you.
It's a miracle!

So wholesome :) I need to call my grandparents 
Bonus +5 years collected 🤗
That's one happy Dadu (grandpa in Hindi). :)
/r/Happycryingdads 
You can tell the mumma is worried he is going to drop the baby but that poppy has got it covered! 
As a kid I always thought moments like this were annoying and I just wanted to go play with toys or cousins. As an adult only then did I realise how good I had it. Why do we have to be such dumb dumb little shits growing up? Taking some of the best things in life for granted.
Pawpaw is ecstatic. The kid is freaked. But now I want a hug from him ☹
This just made my day. And I had a depressing one.
That’s like a great great gran pappy
This is so pure, brought a smile to my face.
That's really wonderful. He looks so incredibly happy.
As someone from India, this reminds me of my Grandpa.. 

Hope you are having a good time in heaven, I miss you so much 😢
No, damn you tears. Stay back I tell you stay back. 
That look of pure love is incredibly heartwarming. Those who can, please give a big hug to your grandpas today for me. I lost mine almost 9 years ago and it still hurts so much when I think of all the things he's been missing.
THIS IS SO PRECIOUS!!! 
If anyone has the source with audio that would be great 
no matter the struggle, it was well worth it, because she is there in my arms, safe.
I love seeing stuff like this coming from such vastly different cultures than my own.  A welcome reminder that we are all coming from the same human experience regardless of location, upbringing, religion, political alignment, etc.  We can all find common ground if we focus on what's similar rather than what's different.
Sheer joy on the Grandpa's face! This probably made his year!
Screw this cane!
\*Grandpa Joe after learning his grandson gets a ticket for a chocolate factory and can bring a +1 (1964, colourized)
This makes me sad because my grandma never got to see my niece (brothers daughter). To be fair and honest, she was our grandmother, my fathers mother, of course there was love but no need to try and make it prettier than it was, she was very mean sometimes, even on the border with evil and so were we to her sometimes. But when people pass away, all of that falls in the water, so take notice people, no matter how mean familiy gets, never hold grudges, always try to make amends and communicate ASAP because you never know when is the last time and you never know if somebody might miss out on something like this. 
Hell finally have someone besides himself to play chess with 
Best thing i saw today.
Might as well pack it up today, Reddit. I think we’ve reached peak pure, loving wholesomeness. 
Aww I wonder what the back story is. This is the face of a man who didn't think he'd get to meet her but is super happy he did. 
i never knew my grandparents at all. All thanks to a mad grandmother that was pissed off dad married a non jew.  Makes me sad to see this, I wish I had been hugged by my grandfather.  The other grandfather was killed in a war. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;
I wish my dad cared this much about his grandson.
You see how he just left his cane and ran? That is the power of love, people.
My parents refused my relationship with my wife and step daughter. My wife tearfully stated that she won't accept their hospitality if they suddenly have a change of heart if we had a child. I definitely see from her point of view, because it hurts me and my wife so much that they refused to acknowledge her after 6yrs of happy relationship.  
I dream/wish my parents can experience the emotions expressed in this gif. But currently, that's impossible...
Man he dumped his 40oz. And cane like it was yesterday’s news. What a proud grandpa 
MRW i’m 90 years old and somebody tells me that I can be reincarnated into this young child.
This made my morning 
The absolutely joy on his face. <3

Who's cutting onions this early in the morning?
Love heals all wounds
Was this his first time? Or have they not seen each other for an extended period of time? Either way, this is wholesome and heartwarming.
Ohhhhh my goodness I hope they get to see each other a lot because look how much joy they bring each other! Little girl was beaming. Elderly man performed a miracle. 
I just flew home last night from my 79 year old mom's who is thousands of miles away. Probably said goodbye for the last time. This punched me in the feels. I'm out Reddit. 
Well FUCK now I'm crying at work. Ive always had a huge soft spot for the elderly, and this hit me right in the bullseye.
Grandpa's love for his lovely granddaughter
maaaaan this brought tears to me.  So many old photos of my grandfather looking at me the same way.  miss that dude so much.
Fuck that cane. You get that baby scent which gives you life.
I seriously got a little wet-eyed.
Fuck my cane! I wanna see my granddaughter
That is real love guys...
How can i upvote twice
I have been watching this for 5 minutes now and I still can't get over how cute it is.
He'd kill a hundred ninjas just to die for her. Beautiful.
Lol the way he turns away.

"This is mine now, kthnxbai"
omg I have an overwhelming need to hug this grandpa! 
##संस्कार फ्रंट पेज पर देख के बड़ी खुशी प्राप्त हुई।
Edit:एक शब्द
He even threw down his bag of onions.
Pure profound happiness.
I never knew my dad's dad and my mom's dad died when I was 12.  I didn't have the opportunity nor maturity to really care about all the stories and lessons my grandpa had.  I'd give anything to sit and have a chat with him for a few hours now as an adult.
That is so cute. I really miss my grandparents. If you have them, tell them how much you appreciate them. I regret not telling mine enough how much of a lasting influence they were on me
I always thought it was stupid yoda needed a cane to walk, then didnt when he would fight. This proves me wrong
Is the the man from the Disney/Pixar chess short? 😱

This is adorable though. 
The way he drops his cane and bag is the sweetest thing! I'm crying at work again, man
If it was my parents seeing their first grandchild, the reaction would be similar. Though they would emphatically add, “It’s about damn time!”
I'm not crying, YOU'RE CRYING

*snif*
I wish anyone loved me that much.
[deleted]
Its too early! Who's cutting onions?!
My heart...
So sweet! ❤️
Drops cane to hold new granddaughter adorably concerned.
The way he literally dropped everything to hold her. 
"Aaaaaaaaah,  I am the Goblin King!".
I wanted so bad to experience this with my grandparents, but now since they all passed including my father i feel the importance of getting a kid is less than slim whilst before it was my dream.

Is this normal to feel this way? im 38 and i been waiting to find the right girl, but now when the kid is not so important i feel my focus has shifted into finding a netflix and chill girl :/
That is just pure love. I wish my grandfather was like that to me.
Imagine loving your children so much that even you love THEIR children! 
Growing up, I always wanted to have that grandfather bond. Both of mine passed way before that could ever happen. Dad’s father passed when my dad was 5, and my mother’s father passed when I was just a few weeks old. I did have a step-grandfather but he was a worthless POS.

I can’t wait to have children and my father and FIL treat my kids just like this.  They LOVE all of their current grandkids immensely. 
dammit man. I cant be tearing up at work. I have to manage people dammit.
Lovely
He’s flying
Love.
that's adorable
high sparrow
Probably great grandfather isn’t he?
Something says war torn and this is a good thing to see if that is the case 
My heart
He went from needing a cane to carrying a child real quick.  
With the way he dropped all his stuff, let’s just hope no other kids show up!
What a precious moment. 
Heart warming.
My grandpa is just like him. I love him a lot. 
Doesn’t get happier than this 
This is so beautiful, I miss my grandpa.  
I miss you grandpa. RIP
Thanks for this
Pure, unfiltered joy. 😄
Awesome!
Funny and cool at the same time.
Well. I miss my grandparents; both pairs.
I’m not crying... you’re crying! 
Ok, I can face Monday now.  That was delightful to see.
Adorable little grandpa! The gif makes me miss my grandparents so much. Nothing like a warm, loved filled hug to make everything feel like its going to be okay.
Who's baby was the granddaughter holding? 
He Willy Wonka’d them
I miss my grandparents.  Only knew one half of the family, but I've confirmed... my mother and her sister are my only remaining blood relatives, and I'm only 39.
Whenever I see genuine strong human emotions, apart from the unsavory ones, i tear up. I teared up.
Oh my god this just made my day, that grandpa was overwhelmed by happiness. 
He was able to run as soon as he saw her
This is so adorable but now I miss my grandpa :’(
Monday has peaked. All down hill for here.
As someone who really doesn't want to have kids, these reaction gifs make me feel like a horrible person for depriving my parents of this experience :(
He's like the grandpa from charlie and the chocolate factory.  He's been bullshitting this whole time. 
This is the best description of happiness and love I’ve seen in a long time. 
To live long enough to know the importance of holding the future generation
This oddly reminded me of the Japanese Iranian girl who met her Grandpa for the first time
He is definitely the great grandpa . Also they are from India judging from how the woman touches the old man's feet who is  presumably her grandpa. 
emocionante.
omfg. i need a new heart.... T\_T
Thats love
Now that is a beautiful sight.
adorable. pure love
I miss my Abuela..  this reminds me of her so much.
Ohh HE STEALIN! 
It's strange. I see older people hobbling with their hands full of cups and popcorn, and their canes hanging from their arms, and want to ask them if they need help; but when I see the same person carrying a child, I immediately assume they're fine. Is it because I know that their instincts have returned to help them?
I was afraid he would til over when holding the baby. I think she was too lol 
This made me wish that Time Travel is possible in the future. My Grandfather died before I was born. I only know him from pictures and many wonderful stories, but I'd love to have seen him in person. 

Fingers crossed a TARDIS pops up one day.
I love this. It’s cute.

My mind still said, ‘Here. Let me take that for you!’
This granddaughter’s reaction to seeing her grandpa. 
Love can be so powerful
He looks like the old man chess player from pixar
Awww.... 
Family is everything.
That is going to be one very spoiled grandchild.
I love how the mom is trying to hold onto the baby in case her dad (grand dad?) loses his grip and he just turns away like "Gimme dis baby.. dis baby is mine. I have held a hundred babies. Gimme dis baby"
Ah bless
Nice feeling 
I miss my grandpa now :(
This is what I enjoy waking up to
That is the pure definition of somones greatest joy in his life
Made me tear up. Seriously so cute. 
That is one supremely enthusiastic grandpa. Must have been a special moment to just drop the cane and go in for a hug.
I want to hold that miracle baby so I can walk again too.
Moms thoughts: don’t drop my kid, don’t drop my kid, don’t drop my kid...
Leave the grandpa or great grandpa argument aside. Look at the joy on his face and the reverence of the mother that she touches his feet and takes his blessings. 
Oh my goodness, I literally said awww!
I'm a great aunt and I'm the same way when someone brings a baby over.  "Gimme, gimme, gimme.  Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle."
My ice cold heart...... 
Wonderful joy. God bless ALL
I kind of think if my grandpa came back from the dead and saw my daughter this is exactly what he’d do. I miss him.
That's love😃❤️
Do you think she knows how much she's loved by that man? I hope so.
It's cute
that he loves her sooo much...what a blessing...shit just made me tear up dammit...what we don't get to remember as babies...love this
Pure happiness 
I'm crying. I wish at least one of my parents or grandparents were like this.
beautiful.
This is v sweet. Lost my grandpa last summer now I'm crying. 
the drop and forget of the cane really reinforces the point. Babies really are a blessing.
Grandchildren are a miracle cure!
:)
My Monday has peaked watching this
India ?
😍😍
What a wonderful father! My fathers never been this excited to see my daughter. 
Reminds me of when my Grandfather met my daughter. It was Christmas eve and When he said Grace over dinner he mentioned her 5 times but forgot to bless the food. I miss that man
So he was just playin with that cane the whole time?
Mom’s thinking “please don’t drop her, please don’t drop her.”
Girl to friend: "Oh you think your grandpa was excited to see you? Did yours drop his cane and still keep walking to hug you? Yeah. I don't think so, Karen." 
I miss my grampa
There are two kinds of people: those who understand the importance of love and those who do not.

This gif is especially touching to me as I have a 3mo-old daughter whom my own father is not interested in meeting.

&#x200B;
Aww he’s so excited to meet her! 
I love how she still attempted to dust his feet even holding the baby.  
Lovely! Which country are these people from, can anyone figure out?
For some reason this reminds me of a quote - "A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.”
He fully just did a Grandpa Bucket. Did anyone see the golden ticket? 
Nope, nope you ain't getting this baby back, this is mine, this is my baby now.
Beautiful moment
There is a fundamental pride in seeing one's purpose fulfilled, in knowing that long after you're gone, that your bloodline will continue, that your family will see the shining of a new sun and survive in a world that you've left. 
Aww, thank you for posting this! His genuine joy brought a huge smile to my face and made my day💜
My heart just exploded. This is awesome. I want to be a grandpa that throws his cane. 
GIMME KARMA
I miss my grandma, rest in piece. 
Awww grandparents are so special 
made my day 🤗
I cant wait to see my grand parents next month !!
HE IS HEALED!!!
This made me cry. 
Wow omg 
Happiness does cure everything doesn't it? 
Dudes been faking an insurance claim with that cane for a decade.   
Beautiful real love
Kashmir?
"This is mine now bye"
As my 5 year old little brother says, “That made my heart smile.”
My eyes feel sweaty.
I can't upvote this enough.
So so so adorable! 
I'll be honest, part of me was expecting him to fall or do a backflip or something.
I got a golden ticket 🛏🤓🤓
Why are you crying? I'm not crying. 
r/mademesmile
More like great great great granddaughter.../s
Oh look! A new smurf to eat! 
Looks like [Geri](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLQG3sORAJQ) has a niece!
my eyes got a bit teary. 
fuck this cane it is slowin me down.
"Tis mine now."
Grandpa, thou art healed!
No no fam, I got dis.
Obviously the grandad is absorbing the child's youth.
MRW i’m 90 years old and somebody tells me that I can be reincarnated into this young child.
That's how I am when I see White Castle
It’s like he drank snake oil and his legs work again.
But Grandpa your cane.

Bah I don't care, let them see me.

But Grandpa your disability pension...
is this in nepal?
TIL: if you lose your cane and are in a pinch, a baby works as a perfect counterbalance. 
IN that moment he younged. The man with the Cane ran and became the carefree man of his youth. 
Lol the way he turns away.

"This is mine now, kthnxbai"
Gahhh! The moment he’s like f this cane and drops it! 
Yeet
Her: dad your cane!!

Dad: cane was just for looks sweetie. Now give me my granddaughter!
Grandpa Bucket levels of recovery 
My two thoughts are "aaaaw....." And "please don't drop the baby"
Yoink.
show this to your siblings or friends with no context to see their reactions
Prolly a great grand daughter.
He look like the old man off Family Guy. Lol
Priceless happiness. This kind of happiness cant be bought!
I wish I had emotions.
Ok internet, you done good this time.
*I've got a golden ticket!*
Reminded me of Grandpa Joe when Charlie tells him about the Golden Ticket
Bapu Joe, throwing away the cane. But seriously, Lakh Lakh Vidhayanh.
OP. This looks to be somewhere in Northern India   (Himalayan foothills). where was this shot? U know? 
That guy did such a good job repairing Woody when his arm fell off.
"This one is too cute. She's mine now"
With spooky theremin music, this could be a terrifying gif 
There's something in my eye all of a sudden
"This one is too cute. She's mine now"
Alternate title: Princess did not guess Rumpelstiltskin‘s real name. 
As soon as he threw his bag and cane away, my heart immediately clenched. Urg. 
Hah, got him! Granddaughter trick works every time, he can walk fine! Take him away boys.
I thought he was going to do a Willy Wonka and add a limp followed by a little tuck and roll.
The child is like “uh this is fine?”
It's like seeing one of them entering a bus
Seeing this as an adult you realize how sweet it is but from the childs perspective it's probably fucking terrifying.  
Goddam onions
Look at me... dis my baby now
Very Nice...
"This my baby now!" 
"Yes, yes...back to the table, my knees hurt." 
Oh the tears!
GIMME GIMME GIMME

&#x200B;

YUSSSSSSSS
And she’s mine now
Screw the cane, my granddaughter's here
"I Can Walk Again!!!!"

"MIEN FUHRER!  I CAN WALK!"
I really don't mean to be negative, but: isn't it kind of a bummer that he's ecstatic and loves the baby whereas she doesn't seem to care much or even know who he is?

I've seen that happen several times and the asymmetry is a bit upsetting.
5 more seconds of video and this might would not have made it to r/aww with the way he was running away 
Charlie you won the golden ticket. Da-do-do-do-do-do-do-doooo.
Hell its about time.
I used to see the same thing when elderly people came into the liquor store i worked in.

They would walk  in using a cane, and 7 out 10 times  they would leave their cane at the store, walking out with a new found pep in their step.

I don't know what it was.  Maybe they got excited that they were going home to drink some booze. 

Alcohol is a hell of a drug
Got to be great great 
Maybe it's the day drinking but that made me tear up
This made me tear up while eating cookies at 8am in bed. Good start to the day :')
It looks like Hector out of breaking bad so much 
not crying you're crying
r/grandpasofreddit
For a grandpa to drop his cane, so he can pick up the grandkid..... priceless!
Must be nice 
I wish my dad was even a 1/4 as excited to see either of his grandsons as this man is.... My great grandpa was great to me and my brother. But it just goes right over my dad's head sadly. 
Wondering how the cameraman planned this meet up
then he did a backflip
This is definitely an Indian. Because that lady touched old man's feet as greet and that happens mainly Indians as showing respect to elders.
Plot twist: she failed to guess Rumplestiltskin's name in time 
Damn he's old as beans
Meanwhile mine lives 4 states away from me and couldn’t care less about me. Ouch 
"heyyyy!..K gimme the kid.."
Time to go visit my grandparents
I don’t think anyone has ever been this excited to see me. 
Story behind the gif: this is his great-grandchild who he is seeing for the first time since his grandson has moved to Canada from India. Saw the full video making rounds in my social media. Will try looking up the source if anyone wants. 
But when he sees another kid, does he toss her aside like his beloved cane? 
I'm always on the fence about children but I know my dad really wants grandchildren and videos like this make me want to provide that for him because I know this is exactly how he'll be. 
Just wanna put it out there, I’ve started selling mops so everyone can clean up their hearts which have melted.
What a sweet grandpa! Although - he does remind me of Geriatrix from Asterix and Obelix comics. Just sweeter
Makes me cry
[I’ve seen him before ](https://youtu.be/29_uSlEEPSk) 
His pure joy is just so beautiful to see
 That joy and love , best thing for today.
That love, happiness, and utter joy emanates out of this vid. I can watch this all day over and over, just to feel the warmth of love
Ok, this time I am crying.
That's cute
Reminds me of my grandfather. Last time I saw him my sister and I presented him my baby nephew. Their lives overlapped for a week or two.
“It’s my child now”

Plot twist: this is actually footage of successful transaction from the deepweb.
That faker didn’t even need a cane!
One of the rolling stones?
This warms my heart 
lmao he's off! my baby now! 
r/masterreturns
If she's a FTM this is her train of thought - "Oh wow! Look how excited he is! Omg. Please don't fall. The BABY. PLEASE OH PLEASE DO NOT DROP THE BABY!"

If she's a STM, "Nobody fall and we're good."
More like seeing grand daughter and great grand  daughter 

Such a pure and sweet reaction 
"finally I can stop faking using this cane. Had to to protect my back just for this one moment"
Best thing love seen today hands down 
There go his disability benefits.
I miss my grandparents so much 
I love how he just tosses the cane and bag to the side. So sweet.
nope not crying
All we need is love 🎵🎵
When he shook his head... he was overcome with joy man... and now I am too.
That mom is mega scared he's gonna drop that baby just like he did his cane.
Man, this is just a really good gif. He's so damn happy.
How the hell is raining just underneath my eyes while I'm indoors? No, I'm not teary eyed. Shut up. 
/r/happycryinggranddads
Hahaha he just takes her and runs like ' my grand baby! ' soooo freaking nice :)
Drop everything that doesn't matter and go after what does! 
uh-oh...this is bring on the feels...!
Omg.   Effing adorable.
“Fuck walking, let me hold this small child!”
He dropped the cane! My heart!
Great.....!!! <3
Damn it, now I'm crying. My brother had booked a flight so our grandfather could meet his son. Sadly my grandfather passed away a couple of weeks before he was scheduled to go. 
This just made my day
my grandpa, his grandpa, their grandpa, yours grandpa, all grandpas and for the most, her grandpa, and grandpa's grandpa are all best... 
That's the old guy in a movie-est thing I've ever seen.
Well that took care of my bad mood in a hurry.  
Interest is more likeable than principal
I’m not crying, you’re crying! 
My heart just got all warm and fuzzy on this Monday Morning thanks to this video 😭💕
Unfortunately he keeled over after the video. 
That was beautiful 🙂
Clearly his intentions were to get the youth nectar from that baby.
That just melted my cold heart
This is really sweet. I’m glad she has family that loves her this much. 
"Oh thank God! Now I can transfer my soul before this old husk keels over!"
Made my day slightly better. 
This reminds me of my grandfathers. Thank you for this. 
My brother and I only have our maternal grandfather and he dotes on my niece whenever he's with her and it's so sweet to see. Brings back great childhood memories. 
I said 'aww' out loud. God damnit, now I'm human again. 
"this is mine now" 
I wasn’t ready to cry this morning. 😢
He just carries her away like, This is *my* baby now! 
Fuck the cane 
#Soemotional Grandfather 
What a fantastic grandpa!! So much love. 

Really miss both of mine know, love you both so much R.I.P
I can’t wait to be a father!

*remembers how old I am*

I can wait a little longer to be a father!
Who needs Jesus when you have granddaughters.
Too many humans on this sub lately, getting ridiculous 
This is the cutest thing ever!

The next time someone tells me men don't have nurturing/parenting instincts, I'm going to show them this.
That baby's love cured him and he dont need that cane no more
She seems 100% confident that he won't drop her.
Okay, bye. This is my baby now. 
That grandpa is so cute.
He reacted the same way Grandpa Joe did when Charlie came home with the golden ticket.
as soon as he dropped the cane Theresa May took his disability benefits 
Everyone talking about their gran pops make me cry. I am sorry grandpa, I wish I couldve been a better grandson. I miss you.
I know they marry young but this is taking the piss. 
Damn acting like a long lost son... its a fucking kid. Youve known him how long? 
Grandpa Joe ?
This makes me miss my grandpa... glad a younger generation gets to enjoy their grandpa!
'This is mine now' 
anyone else eyes play tricks on them and think the thumbnail was a husky
Fantastic!
So sweet! I love that even though he is so excited to see the grandchild, he still takes a moment to acknowledge his child too- by touching her lightly. What a nice moment.
Grandpa Joe

Someone cutting onions?
So lovely! 
I love how he drops his cane to hold the baby. 
End of life and beginning of life
Good job op you lost this guys settlement for him. Now the insurance company has proof he doesnt need that cane
Dang it OP... I really didn’t want to cry this late.
Grandpa joe is such a lazy piece of trash
"Thanks, shes mine now"
He loves that kid so much his sore legs got better and he didn't need a cane anymore -or his shopping
Love has no age
Who’s cutting onions..
Love how he literally gets rid of the walking stick! Grandpa power on! Such a sweet moment 
With so much focus on infanticide (and sexism) in India all the time, it's great to see a positive story come out. Obviously not everyone there is a crazy maniac and this is a great reminder of that!
I've never truly understood this kind of unconditional affection for family.  Guess I'm just not wired that way.
I bet there is no safer place for that child but in that man's embrace. 
20s depression are because reproduction age has artificially swifted from 16s to the 30s...
Don't wait until you're this old to realize what's important in life. 
Family, man. I think it's cruel that in the modern world it's okay that families are nowhere as closely knit or local as they used to be. It always made me so sad to see how incredibly happy my grandma was to see her grand-grand-children, but she couldn't ever be a part of their lives in a meaningful way because my brother lived so far away.
I got the golden ticket! 
Reddit, kindly stop reminding my biologic clock that time is running out for my uterus. Thanks 
Where are the fur babies?
So he's  been faking it all this time
And that poor little girl probably is thinking he smells like piss. 
Tearing up! I love this. I just went to Japan a couple months ago so my husband’s grandfather could meet his first great grand baby (4yo). I’m so glad we went. He was so happy. 
Omg. This is so WHOLESOME!!! 
Beautiful! 
Those aren´t tears its manwater 
Strange thing is that, I saw this video at another place and they said grandson. 
I love that fact that he did not worry about carrying the kid and hurting himself in the process. Love is powerful. 
MY PROGENY
Imagine if we all just loved each other like this man loves a grandchild. Forget bloodlines, forget names, we are all people, we are all in this together.
Did we just witness a miracle? 
I love the end when he just turned around and take her with him: "okay, you can leave us. We have a lot to talk about."
Presh.
The excitement made him fucking RUN 

Drop the cane and the little bag 

Yup only love can do that 
Man throws his cane down exposing himself as a medicare fraudster 
This will never get enough upvotes... *Ugly cries*
This is just beautiful!
Fuck this cane. Fuck this hat. Gimme that baby!
My niece named her great grandma without meeting her, only through pictures and being told it was her great grandma. Due to where they live, different countries, they haven't met. But my niece will talk about her like she was there. She would say I watched it with my "her nickname for great grandma" or "nickname" will get it for me, or I want my " nickname".  It's strange but adorable. 
I miss my granddads. :'-( 
I never had the chance to have a grandpa, this made me emotional
That’s in Punjab, India for sure. Looking at the window design and mom reaching to touch grand pas feet to ask for his blessings.  
Great granddaughter maybe
That is a man who has worked and lived for his family. Op thanks for sharing, really brightend up my crappy evening.
Must be great great granddaughter
I'm just speechless.... It again remind me how important emotions are 👍👍
And I just melted into a pile of goo over his reaction.
This scene makes me cry. My grandpa passed away last week.  I planed to visit him next January with my 9 month old .  Now my kid would never have the chance to see his great grandpa.

I am in China , my grandpa was in Taiwan . 
When I was younger, I never understood how or why older people got so enamored and overwhelmed with pure emotion by their children. I was like, "What's the big deal, it's another person". I also thought it was kind of selfish for people to keep creating more people when there are so many who don't have parents and just so many people in general already. 

I'm starting to realize that as you get older, death becomes much more concrete and personal as a concept instead of just "knowing it happens" as an intellectual fact. I think about all the memories and experiences I've had and I try to reconcile their importance with the fact that there's a strong possibility that one day, it's going to be as if this never happened (from my perspective).

I can't say if I'm ever going to have kids. But I see now how I would be comforted knowing that something that was me (in a way) continues to exist and will go to experience and feel and have memories. 
So sweet. 
I'm crying... why am I crying...WHO DID THIS TO ME!!!???
Probably the same reaction as my grandpa if I went for a Long trip away from him
This looks like some pure stuff from a Disney movie 
So much awwh
The mother is scared that he will drop the baby
This is the cutest thing I've seen in a long time thank you! 
Genuine love
you can't feel pain with that much joy in your heart
I knew somebody whose grandfather did that after finding out that he won to golden ticket to a chocolate factory tour.
This is so sweet and precious. It really makes me miss my grandfather, who would instantly light up whenever my daughter and I came to visit him and my grandmother. He had dementia, was almost entirely blind, and couldn’t hear too well, but he was always so alert whenever my daughter was around. He would speak to her in a silly, high-pitched voice and called her “sweetheart.” Even though my daughter is too young to remember him, I’m so grateful that I have those memories of them together. He passed away earlier this year, 19 days after my grandmother. They were truly special people.
Damn onions
Pakistani grandpas are a whole different thing.
Love and joy, a vicarious high.
I thought the high sparrow didn't have any family?
Like 15 years younger! Soo cute
Awe my heart. ❤️ 
Yep getting off reddit on a high note...thanks!!!
Oh now that made my day!
Aww I never had nice grandparents so it's always nice to see sweet ones.
Oh my goodness. That is one happy man. 
Awwww
oh my, bruh on sight he slung that cane to the side he was ready. when he start to embrace he wasn't playing any games. shame she won't know how much that moment meant to him till much later in her life.
Grandpa Joe is healed again!
He’s 50 years old
The power of love!
From the thumbnail I thought this would be about a dog.
Best thing on the Internet! 
wtf somebody help this dude! He deadass drops his cane and walks around with a baby. Somebody needs to walk beside him or get him his cane lmao
That is pure joy!
My heart! 
We know where she gets her curly hair. :)
And now I'm in tears cause he reminds me of my gandad.  
He was faking the cane situation the whole time lol He’s good!
Me when I get home from work and see my cat 
Gramps is like "Ok, well, see you later!"
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen ♥️
I miss my grampz :(
I'm a grown ass man crying in a hotel bar. Got me right in the feels
"Organs, fresh organs"
My hearttt!
F this cane. I got a baby to hold.
Cute but christ almighty was i scared he was gonna topple over and flatten that baby
I bet thats the fastest hes moved in years 
How happy he must have been! Grandpa hugs are the best!
At the end it's like ok this is mine now good bye. 
Sweet  i just turned in to a grandpa on oct 10th 
"fuck this cane I need to see my baby" 
I'm not crying you're crying! Also I'm crying.
I wish I got to know my grandfather :/ 
He didnt need the cane this whole time..
Reminds me of grandpa Joe from Charlie and the chocolate factory.
Wow. I hope the little girl sees this video in 20 years...
Dude runs like he doesn’t need that cane anymore. Sooo cute 
I'm not crying, you're crying... 
this has truly brightened an otherwise bland Monday 
This is how my dad is with my daughter. I love it. 
Way to make me feel inept for not giving great-grandchildren to my own grandparents. That was one of the cutest things I've seen for a long time.
My great great grandmother(my grandmother's grandmother) was like this when i was born. Didn't see me grow up unfortunately
Looks like he's happy to see his granddaughter and her child
Reddit, we have a new grandpa!
"Yes, give me your youth child!"
Ugh, this just pulled at my heart strings. I just want to go up to him the way he did that baby and hug him. 

So much love. ❤️❤️
My faith in humanity is restored when I see how many upvotes something like this gets- thank you Reddit.
TEARS
So he didn't need the cane? I'm getting Grandpa Joe vibes from this.
If I live long enough to see grandchildren I'll be very much the same.
As someone with  a new  4 month old granddaughter - I can definitely relate!
“She’s mine now. Go away.”
I hope the kid gets to enjoy his grandpa's love for a long time...
The look on the granddaughter's face on the very last frame is priceless.
Real love :)
I think he's  a very great grandpa! 
This is what true joy and elation look like.
So what’s the story?
Kids are at their most lovable at that age (about 1-1.5 years). Its awesome. Their cognitive and motor skills have developed enough to show and understand affection and they laugh and smile constantly without the selfish asshole tendencies that start around 2 years
Wow ok. My heart is dead. 
 
i wish i could say someone in my family would be this excited to see me. I understand that there may be extenuating circumstances, but there has to be an amazing feeling to someone being this happy to see another human being.
Something about the older you get the more your heart softens for the young. 
MadeMeSmile material :'D
pretty sure the grandpa didn't have children till he was 80 yrs old...
And now I’m crying at work 
He's probably from Punjab, judging by the way the mother respected her father/father-in-law.

In traditional Indian culture, one gives respect by touching someone's feet. In Punjab, they got a bit lazy and touch the knees instead of all the way down at the feet.
Best thing i've seen today, no, all month if being honest.
Sooo did he end up running away with the kid... I need to see the whole thing!
He just throws the cane

"No more old guy legs anymore, I've got to see my daughter!"
What cane ?
And off he goes...lol
That's the sweetest thing I've ever seen 
BEHOLD! HE CAN WAWLK!
You could almost see him tumble forward as soon as he drops the cane. 
i want cuddles from bubbas when im his age, i want cuddles with bubbas right now! guess i'll just have to settle for cuddles with a vicious, incoherent toddler when i get home.
He's making a very slow get-away! 
fucking who is cutting onions here...
That is true happiness right there
GIVES IT TO US!  MY PRECIOUS!

TIL: Sméagol can and has reproduced.  
😭😭😭 the feels!
This makes me miss my grandpa. I never met one and I only had 7 years with the other. For those of you with grandparents, hug them extra tight for me. 
I love old people 
He's like Yoda when he dropped his cane to fight Count Dooku. 
This is so wholesome :D
Which one of you is cutting onions?
That's even more than awww...
 Oh how sweet! Ajoba goad ch astat! :) (Gradpas are the sweetest!) 
That gesture is called Namaskar in Marathi. We usually do it with both hands joined together touching other person’s feet. This family seems to Punjabi guessing based on the way she is touching his knees with one hand. Just my observation. :) 
I’M not crying.  YOU’RE crying!
;) that is real joy
“Finally, my blood sacrifice is here!”
This is a sacrifice to a Satanic wizard, you sick fucks.
This is so pure. I hope that grandpa gets all the upvotes :’)
This is the cutest kidnapping ive ever witnessed
That must be the bestest gramps in the world. 
anyone else crying and missing their own grandpa?
MY HEART!!!!!!
OP is rolling in the karma lol
🎵It's the circle of life🎶
If he were a complete stranger I would have the opposite reaction that I did.
Damn this really pulls at my heart strings it reminds me of my grandpa he was just like him except he went a few months ago 
*She's MINE now*
Yeah yeah how are you, I'm doing fine, now **gimme the baby!**
A human eyebleach is rare, but this one is just awesome.
Necromancy Lvl.100
Heartwarming stuff <3 
My grandpa used to look and dress exactly like this. Last 5 minutes I have just been looking at this gif again and again thinking about him. 
Why I’m watching this like 6 times.? Aww what a sweet moment
This just made my day!
I love how just starts walking away. "Mine now"
Man, the adrenaline kicked in and look like he was 80 again
This warms my heart so much. I wish my grandfather (never met either) was alive to meet my daughter 
Oh my gosh. What a blessing 
Beautiful !!!
Beauty of human relationships
r/grandpajoehate
Man, the feels are killing me.  TT

Great, great ????
‘Gimme the baby!’
Hard to imagine a north American grandparent this happy about family. Its clear our first-world culture has become shit.
Im 6’3, 255lb/black, bald headed stud, been to the joint to many time to remember,  I think I have a c#.......THIS BOUGHT ME TO TEARS!!!
Am I a terrible person because I kept watching to see if he dropped the baby?
Man I've always wanted to know what it would feel like to have a grandfather. Dammit must feel amazing. 
I’M NOT CRYING YOU ARE!
He lyin he don’t need no cane
Seeing him genuinely happy makes me genuinely happy.
Haha, he was so excited to see the baby, and just patted the mama.

The younger generation does tend to bring out the inner youth in us all. Most days. 
This reminded me of my grandfather who passed away a few months ago.  He was always so happy to see his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.  Even his extended family.  I miss him very much but I will treasure the memories of him.  He made all of us feel like the most loved person in the world.
This is me when my gf comes home with groceries. 
Man I wish I could make my parents happy like that. But ya know, children cost money
Aw! This makes my heart so happy!
That is wholesome af.
I miss mine.
Someone’s not getting their disability check next month 
This is so adorable. 
I missed out on having either of my grandfathers in my life, so it really warms my heart to see this! 
Beautiful!  If everyone could feel that loved..
Uncle Joe looking mother fucker
Great and now I’m in floods of tears I miss my grandpa 100 times more now. He passed away 4 years ago. 
Actually he's her great grandfather. They are from my city.
r/AdorableOldPeople
I wish I grew up with grandparents! Mine passed before I was born. This precious gif almost made me cry. (Almost!)
This looks like no material well-being would make him that much happy :')
 I kept repeating this .it's soooooo good
All the feel 😭
How sweet - made me cry a bit!
If this happened in the UK, the old man would have all his benefits stopped and be forced back into work for throwing down his walking stick.
I almost cry
Typical Grandpa Joe. You get him excited enough, he forgets that he was faking his ailments.
Is it weird iv seen this before
It's like the usual reactions people havr when they get puppies. 
Who tf is cutting onions?!!!
I AM NOT CRYING!
My hormones just told my uterus to have a baby right now so my dad can have this moment.
[deleted]
World's slowest kidnapping.
I really want to know why he feels this way towards his granddaughter..why usually granddads feels this way towards grandkids
[deleted]
I can't believe I pushed that guy's lazy ass around all day until he was ready to stand up and steal the show. Well... I got news for you, Albert. If that's your real name. The show's not over.
He’s been faking that limp for years 
Pure love 💕 
Has to have a cane to walk...

Sees kid and throws canes so he can grab kid and walk away...

Um... anyone worried he’s gonna fall with that kid or has he been punking them the whole time? 
That kid was remarkably chill for that Old Man Jafar he's never met grabbing him.
MEIN FUHRER .... I CAN VALK!!! 
Looks like we got another Grandpa Joe.
This guy can't even hold himself up, I'll be dammed if I let him hold my baby too 
[deleted]
Am I the only one thinking that he is just eager to drain the life force out of her?
Mother fucker didn't even need that cane. I'm still not certain that isn't the child catcher in disguise.
Yes police, this is the man here!!
aww so glad they didn't abort it
So he was lying about needing a cane?? 
Whoa. Did he think she was dead or something? Geeez...
