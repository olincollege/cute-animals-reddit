Omg I’d do anything to see my neighborhood owl. I’ve been listening to him hoot hoot every goddamn day for many years and I often follow his hoots on walks to try to find him. But it never works. Lucky you.
Gorgeous! It’s helping control your vermin population.

Also, black eyes on an own means it’s nocturnal.

Just remember, you only saw it because the owl wanted you to see it...
Are you Harry Potter?!
It is a superb owl.
This gives me the 4th kind vibes.
No post on Sundays!!!
I can never look at owls the same after the fourth kind lol
Looks like it might be a barred owl eh! <3
Love it! We’ve got an owls nest in a big sycamore on our property and we see them occasionally and hear them every night. The male keeps watch while the female sits on the eggs. We just moved in last summer but apparently they’ve been coming back to nest here for like 5 years. I feel like Tony Soprano with his ducks.
Uh-oh. Owls are the the guides to the afterlife in a lot of Indigenous American cultures. Best to stay indoors tonight!
No post on sundays
So when do you start at Hogwarts? Have they been doing virtual schooling during Covid or is that not a big thing in the wizarding world?
I thought this was a Labyrinth reference.
“The owls are not what they seem”
Congrats on making it to hogwarts mate
 Who, who, who cooks for you?
I am scanning the background for a cat
That’s a beautiful owl.

I see mine and sometimes his friend he talks to  almost every morning very early when I’m out with my dog. I call him Archimedes (Medes for short). He lets me get really close sometimes and seems to like it when I talk to him.

Tonight is the night it kills you in your sleep
Someone just got their acceptance litter to Hogwarts
So satisfying!!
Do you have too many owls in your driveway?
One time a few years ago I was living with a roommate and we liked to play video games together, but our set ups were in different rooms. His set up was in this small room next to the back door, which he would often leave open to let the breeze in. 

Well, one night I hear him scream and run out of the room. I walk in and he yells, "There's a fucking owl in here!". Sure enough, I look up at the window sill and there is a fucking owl perched up there. I grabbed a blanket and slowly walked towards it, blanket fully spread out incase of an attack. It surprisingly let me gently wrap him in this blanket and then let me grab his talons as he perched on my hands.

For a moment we just kind of looked at each other. He was way more chill then I expected. Then I walked outside and tossed him up in the air to let him free.

It was pretty fucking awesome and I think about it sometimes
He's so official. Probably looks at other owls and goes, "it's whom", all snarky and shit.
A neighbor just posted this as if its a picture he took. WTF man.
Somehow it looks like it is staring at you motherfuckerdly.
How do you know it's the same owl?
*You’re a wizard, Harry*
Wow. What a treat.
Thats a bright pic for night time. Night mode or special lense ?
We don't have a neighborhood owl, we used to have foxes though, they lived next door in the mound I think, I was probably 6 or so and I would be excited for my dad to come home. when he came into the cul-de-sac the foxes would come out, at least that's how I remember it. It was a totally normal thing, oh the foxes are chasing the car again, miss those guys
This is amazing! I love owls.
In the UK we have the [tawny owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tawny_owl). There was one outside my house who used to call when I couldn't sleep and I named him Barney.
"You're fucked muggle."
Now tonight watch the fourth kind. It'll be great.
Don’t sleep in the house tonight!
a flying cat!!
r/superbowl would like this.
Me at 2AM after hearing the neighborhood owl hooting for over 2 hours:

Owl: “HOOOOO. HOOOOOOOOO.”

Me: “Shuttup!”

*Silence*

5 mins later:

“HOOOOOOOO. HOOOOOOOOOOOO.”

I swear if I ever see him in person I’m gonna cuss him smooth out
Magnificent owl!
Awesome!
Thanks for sharing birds are fun creatures!
Gorgeous creature
We have one like that! We named it Ollie!
Owls are the coolest of birds. U you sure so lucky!
Hey, you have an owl guarding your home. Lucky you!
“Whooo you lookin at?”
For some reason, it always made me sad when I saw an owl perched on a mailbox when we lived on the edge of a forest. Seemed undignified
How wonderful!❤️
Owl: Greeting Zachery, only few get to witness the glorious sight of me.
I hear mine all the time but almost never see them until I was night walking my dog and one swooped low over my head. I might have pooped my pants a little. It was HUGE! They are beautiful.
So pretty
I believe that’s good luck!
It’s so majestic!
Amazing!!
We have them behind the house. I've only seen their giant silhouette flying silently between the eucalyptus trees. You can hear them communicate with their buddies nearby. It's a trip!!
Unreal.
Now you KNOW who.
To those who have a neighborhood owl (jealoussss) and mimic competitors / prey: what are you thinking??  Have you *seen* owl talons?  Did you never find tiny skulls in the owl pellets you dissected in science class?  You know they’re silent assassins, right?  I’d like to keep my scalp intact, thank you very much.
It looks like he purposely struck this pose, just for you.

🦉 Hoo. Hey man. How’s this? I’ll let you see me this once, take a picture and make it memorable.
Who?
This would be a dream come true!
He’s comfortable with the surroundings
Oh wow - seeing a wild owl is something I’ve never witnessed and really pisses me off lol! I hope for one day to see one. Just recently seen my first wild fox so I feel my chances are getting better.
So it has begun...
Owl : *long have I waited for this day you finally ripened to a good age and weight my prey*
Finally solved the hoodunnit
There is an owl across the street in a huge tree that is loud af at night. I keep trying to find it but standing in the road with a flashlight yelling at a tree isn’t a good look
Did you call for the goblin king??
The owls are not what they seem
Owls are so cool! I used to go on long walks at night in the country and sometimes in the moonlit road ahead I'd see a shadow passing overhead and look up to see a silent, fluffy owl floating overhead. It was so awe-inspiring!
Y’all... I think that’s an omen. Like it not always great news when a seemingly omnipotent owl suddenly appears after years and years.. right? Guys?
I have never seen an owl in person in my entire life. I've been around for about 20 years; that shouldn't be possible.
Owls are amazing creatures. I had the strange opportunity to see an injured one up close. It was one the ground as I was jogging by, at the National Reconnaissance Office. I called the local wildlife place to come pick it up, but I sat beside it for about 30 minutes and “talked” to it to try and calm it until they arrived. They are probably one of the coolest looking creatures that I have ever seen up close.
Glad to see it's actually an owl!

My neighbor used to complain about the noisy "daytime owls" in our neighborhood.  When I figured out what he was talking about, I didn't have the heart to tell him his "daytime owls" were actually plain old mourning doves.
I just saw your post on Nextdoor! Hey, neighbor!
There's a bunch behind my parents house I always hear but never saw until the lock down, one had landed on the back yard fence and was chilling.. eventually it flew into the trees and looking for it I noticed like 7 more all around perched in trees, it was surreal
What a incredible experience 💯
You have been accepted into Hogwarts
Did you get accepted to Hogwarts?
Looks like Someone ist going to Hogwarts soon. 🦉
On Christmas Eve 2020, husband and I were on our way back from a late night walk to look at Christmas lights. Heard a very loud conversation between two owls somewhere near by. We followed the hoots and ended up watching these two owls interact with each other and even fly around above us for about 15 minutes. It was a magical.
Unfortunately I’m not as educated on this topic as others. 


I would hear this owl occasionally, so I used a recording of a owl mating call, high quality .wav file and played it on the speaker hidden in the garden. After a while I saw an owl come towards us and perched on the branch. I stopped by playing the sound afterwards. It sat for a while, finally gave us a direct glance.. me and my brother rejoiced over it !  We lived in the woods for a while, were really curious about this owl and then some peacocks whom we never saw !
Am I the only one that finds his look moderately unsettling?
You are about to receive some good news from Hogwarts! Also you are 11 y/o 😜
Are you getting mail delivered?
WHOO WHOO-WHOO you lookin at?
Check your fireplace.
THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM!
It's an omen.......
Dose it go “WHO” or dose it make demonic screeching noises?
Huh, looks like Jareth is in town.
My neighbourhood just has a cat that runs in everyones attic at night
Jareth?!!!
Did you give it a name?
That's so cool!
"Finally got me, huh, big dog?"
IT'S A TRAP!
Superb.
I've got one in my neighborhood for the last 2 years and I've seen it once as well

Damn thing killed my cat though 😭
I hope to see the one that visits my big dying tree. It was hooting at the top of the tree so I couldn’t get a good look, but it looked big. They truly are majestic creatures.
Have you named him?
Ahh. Looks like your post is running on time. My owl is a bloody menace!! 

PS. The bird bites.
I bet it's not the first time he's seen you.
Cute owl but also cute home
Anyone see that ship that blocked that canal????
And he’s color coordinated with your house!!
3 30 AM comes for us all.
He’s adorable.
Harry Potter comment
That’s always wonderful! I have two males and a couple of females in my area, and it’s a treat to see one or more of them.
Awwwww 🥺
What'd you snap the Pic with?
It’s not the first time he’s seen you.
Knock knock!  Who's there?  Who!  Who who?  Did somebody leave the freakin' window open cause we got an owl in the house?
There are so many owls around me (southeastern pa) I wonder if they’re coming to collect my soul. I haven’t seen one!
Well owl be damned....
Owls are just magnificent.
Owls are the best
Barred owls have the CRAZIEST screeches!!!
I bet it’s not the first time he saw you
Well now you know where to hang the dead rats.
looks like it’s the first time it’s seen you too
Ask neighbors to not use rodenticide!
Average lifespan of owls...20-25 years
You remind me of the babe
Id watch out, the goblin king could be anywhere
for some reason it reminds me of that scene in it's always sunny in philadelphia where charlie and mac stare at each other
What a r/superbowl
“This is my house now.”
Fits perfectly with the surrounding
Dude I went shore fishing at the beach and saw a dwarf owl for the first time this weekend
This looks like something from a Harry Potter movie :)
Privet drive
So which house do you think you’re going to be sorted in to?
owl on a Mail Box.
No talking letters?
Did that house get letters flying into their door?
Did you get any mail?
He's from the wizarding world
Delivering mails
* Hagrid has entered the chat *
Awwh. Hedwig came with your acceptance letter.
Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t hold with such nonsense...

Am I the only one getting Harry Potter vibes?
Privet Drive ?
Expect a letter from Hogwarts soon
I thought this was a screen grab from Harry Potter haha!
Your hogwarts letter should be arriving soon!
Are you a wizard and is your name Harry?
Someone is about to get a letter from Hogwarts
You're a wizard
I don’t know why but I feel like it kinda remind me of a scene in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone film. Lol
In Little Whinging?
Did you check your mailbox? Perhaps a Hogwarts invitation..
So you got your letter to Hogwarts then?
Someone just got their Hogwarts acceptance letter!
i have always been scared of owls from a weird "documentary" on animal planet about the owl man i saw when i was younger. last week on my night walk with my dog, i saw one fly by and to my suprise i wasnt as scared seeing one in person. the owl was so beautiful.
Wandavision season 2?
Privet Drive vibes
Yer a wizard, Harry
Time to pack your bags to hogwarts
Yer a wizard, Harry!
Yer a wizard
Someone's going to Hogwarts.
My home growing up had an owl babies in a tree in the back and we saw them from our window maybe once but never got an eye on the mom. 
One weekend our family freinds stay over and i come down ro breakfast to see the dad with 2 claw marks on his forehead 🤣 apparently he went for a closer look at the babies and mom swooped by with a warning scratch.
Someone vor accepted at Hogwards I See
Man, something is eerie about this pic
That picture is simultaneously both daylight and nighttime somehow. My brain can't even.
Wtf kinda Harry Potter house is this?
You are a wizard, Harry!
Is this Privet Drive? Does Harry get his invitation to Hogwarts?
Who?
might be finally delivering your long lost Hogwarts acceptance letter
Looks like some kid is getting invited to Hogwart's
Cue the Harry Potter soundtrack
Another invitation to Hogwarts?!
Now you know Hoo it is
Someone's going to Hogwarts
Congrats on getting into hogwarts
Nice! Kinda looks like a scene from Harry Potter.
My nightmare.
Guess you are going to Hogwarts
Oooh! I hear the one from our park EVERY night, it even flew over me as I heared it once. Never seen it...
in a very creepy staring way; You met the Owl and The Own Knew 😩😩😌😌🥰🥰🥰🇺🇸🇺🇸
Looks like he just delivered a letter from Hogwarts.
#Your parents or spouse have been trashing the mail for years.
I read this as I heard the owl outside my window, who I never seen :')
Whoooo whoooo whooooo .....cares. 

That was mean.... I actually care.
Congratulations on your admission into Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry
What a beautiful photo! Congrats on catching a glimpse of your neighborhood friend, they're gorgeous!
OMG! You are about to receive your letter!!!!
I love owls ♥️💕❤️♥️
That's not an [owl](http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/xh526c6446.gif)
Pack that suitcase you are going to hogwards
Looks exactly like the owl from "Legend of the guardians".
F-ing majestic!!
Great pic
Someone’s going to Hogwarts!!!
You better check for your Hogwarts letter
Someone is getting a hogwarts letter
DID YOU GET YOUR INVITATION?!?!?!?!
Looks day time for some reason
I found a spot on the property I hunt where a bobcat got ahold of one of these.  The primary feathers are super cool you can see why it's called "barred owl."  Just alternating bands of white and brown.  

Also, these are some brutally effective killing machines. They can hit an adult 11 lb turkey roosting in the trees and ride that bitch to the ground.
congratulations on your acceptance to hogwarts 😁
He's been delivering mail to your neighbour for years that's why. Maybe you should knock on and check there isn't a kid under the stairs that needs to get his ass to Hogwarts
That's the best feeling in the world.
I've been hearing two owls hooting back and forth to eachother the past few weeks too out side my house! It's so cool.
Congrats on your Hogwarts acceptance!
So cool!!! We also have an owl that lives on the golf course behind us. We’ve heard it for years. In 2018 my mom scored a photo. Haven’t seen him since. Our neighbors recently had a tree cut down after it sustained significant damage in a storm. Now the owl has relocated, I think directly in our yard as it’s SOOO LOUD. I’m a tad nervous to be out on the patio late at night when I can hear him so close. Anyway, ours is a great horned owl.

Edit to add [owl tax](https://imgur.com/a/BwvNEwh). Also, this pic is from 2018 so I guess it’s possible this isn’t the same owl that currently resides near us. But I’ve spent a lot of time listening to hoots on YouTube and I think what I’m hearing still is a great horned.
You're a wizard, seisonio.
Looks like someone is getting a letter from Hogwarts
Man, I live in the edge of a large residential development, and the trees behind my house were like a party zone for owls and birds. Then one day I woke up to all of the trees gone and the road being widened. Roads been torn up for a year now with almost no progress, and haven’t seen a bird (let alone heard an owl) since. I actually cried one day, which is pathetic considering I’m 30 years old and never cry about anything. We are just fucking nature up for no reason. 

Then the HOA has the fuckin balls to tell me I can’t plant trees in my own yard unless they are “approved” by some bitch nobody can ever get ahold of. They can suck the corn out my ass before I take down my trees 🖕🏻
Glad you finally saw it!  Made an account like I told you I would just to comment. Let's see if you spot me!
It's not the first time it's seen YOU....
me: my god, the day has come, MOM IM GOING TO HOGWARTS
I know what movie...the fourth kind

Does Harry Potter live in your neighborhood?
Knock knock

But did you ever figure out who cooks for you?
Who says this is the owl you hear? Who? Who? Who?
But how many times has he seen you? 👀
**Who?**
But tonight is NOT the first time the owl sees you!
Somehow, this reminded me of the wolf that shows up at the end of Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox.
Hogwarts tryin to get a hold of ya
It has a quest for you!
You should've just thrown beads.
Somebody open that mailbox, there’s a letter to Hogwarts!
Beautiful owl heheh
Beautiful cameo appearance. ❤

Reminds me of Bert krisers dad: https://youtu.be/YyJfFj5ehzE
And it sees YOU 🦉🦉🦉
You're so lucky! That would be such a nice sound to go to sleep to.
tonight is the night you die
“Mister Potter got a mail”
Prepare to be abducted.
“It’s not an owl”
Who?
Awwww
Oh! What a beauty!!
Your baby brother isn't named Toby, is he?
A Grand sight to behold!
I heard this owl for years, and tonight is the first time I've heard it.
We have owls calling to each other year round and have seen their silhouettes at night in the trees. Last year in the dry SoCal weather this one came to drink at the bird feeder.

[https://youtu.be/ooEx7\_8An8s](https://youtu.be/ooEx7_8An8s)
"You fucker"
Lol, this owl looks like the owl from the movie, The Fourth Kind
Aaaaaaawww!!! 🥰

Some Harry Potter shit right there!
Did you get your letter from hog warts yet?
Were you beginning to suspect it was Bert Kreischer's dad?
You must have missed the hogworts express.
Would be nice if you're being invited to Hogwarts too
Near the park I live I was lucky enough to see an owl with it's babies. It was such a beautiful sight to behold, the noises they made were so unique, and I was happy they weren't afraid or anything of me and my sister. Guess it helps I constantly give walks around the park at night when there's literally no one else around lol
2 months ago I was standing in the door waiting for my ride when I seen something fly into a tree, it was dark and I seen its shaow and watch it land in the tree. It was midnight an cold like 25 f and I walked out under the tree thinking I was gonna see mothman, but really it was a big ass white owl, big mofo too. He let me walk completly around the tree on the ground checking him out and then, even tho I was freezing I stood in the best sightline to him for about 9-10 minutes watching each other i wanted to hear him vocalize really bad and withstood the fuckingggg cold to watch him. Then as silently as he flew up to the tree, he took off on his hunt and it was really freaking cool watching him take off out of a tree like that, they really are absolutly silent, it was worth the wait sitting out in the cold. My phone is junk an I didn't wanna pull it out an point it at him and take a pic for the chance of the flash scaring it away. I'll never forget it, I have only seen one other owl in my life and it was from very far away.
No letter?
threre's about 8 of them that live in the eucalyptus trees and they hoot to each other at night.  its become a part of my night to listen to them. I've always loved owls.
Let us know if ya get probed!
Beautiful
It's a good bet that owl has seen you many times.
My dad showed me a trsiler for some hooror movie with owls and im legit so scared of owls noe
He was just delivering a hogwarts invitation letter.
Someone’s going to Hogwarts
Well that kid is going to hogwarts.
This picture is giving me Harry Potter vibes.
Did you get your letter? I'm still waiting for mine.
Watch out for the bearded fuck turning the lights out.
Owls are bad omens in many Native American cultures.

I saw one the other day. Was initially excited, then worried.

I wonder if the owl population has grown since the pandemic?
Hogwarts letters don’t ever come this early.
Whooooo you staring at
Mr. and  Mrs. Dursly, of number 4 "Privet" drive....
You’re a wizard harry.
I believe this has some cultural significance.
How is the top comment not about a Hogwarts letter? Or am I too old?
I think your Hogwarts letter has arrived
https://youtu.be/4wyglrlbyB4
Is that Privett Drive?
You’re a wizard, Harry!
Be careful, could be the Goblin King.
Your letter has arrived and it seems someone is hiding it from you 0.0
The owls are not what they seem
owls are fucking terrifying
Congratulations, you are going to hogwarts
Why do you have sunlight at night?
You got mail!
This reminded me of Harry Potter and then Guardians of GaHoole. Good times
Might want to check the mail, maybe you got accepted into Hogwarts
Off to Hogswart you go mate!
Hogwarts is summoning you, off you go!
Barred Owls have some spooooky voicings! It always raises my hackles.
This gives me Harry Potter vibes
Looks like you’re going to Hogwarts after al
HEDWIG!!
Don’t get Kathleen Peterson’ed
Wowwww this is so neat. What a beautiful creature.
"I've been hearing owls for years and today I finally saw one!" would have been a better title. You have no idea if you've been hearing the same owl. This one is cute tho
damn, he looks majestic AF on that mail box lol
You’re a hairy wizard.
He’s been trying to give you your acceptance letter to wizard school.
He’s come to warn you about something.
The owls are not what they seem
Did this owl come with a letter from hogwarts or nah?
Hedwig! Is that you?
Am I the only person who immediately thought of Harry Potter.
I think you’ve been invited to attend Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry
I think you missed your Hogwarts invitation..

Very Harry Potter-esque a la Privet Drive!
Ohhhhhhh .. Shhhiiizle!! Someone just got accepted to Hogwartz!

r/accidentalharrypotter

Owl post
congrats!
Who?
The fourth kind is coming for you.
We had one in our neighborhood we called "Owl Capone" that would let us get within 5 feed of him.  We'd always see him on our walks.

I suspect he was raised by humans and released because he was NOT worried about us whatsoever.  

We'd walk right past him sometimes and he's be on a ranch within 5' of the trail
Is nobody going to comment on the fact that this looks like Vernon & Petunia Dursley’s house from Harry Potter..? And hello...an OWL?!
Owl be there...

Next time.
I think he might have just delivered your Hogwarts letter!
Uhhh... I think you're supposed to go to Hogwarts now.

Be careful about wishing your baby brother away while that owl is around, he might be a 80's popstar in disguise

How do you know it was THIS owl?
Where is this privet drive???
Happy 11th birthday!
Did you get your acceptance letter?
Who?
Congratulations on getting into Hogwarts!
Looks like one from Hogwarts ministry who has come to deliver you the letter
Now lift up its feather cloak and expose his long skinny legs.
‘Hooo’ the fuck are you looking at? -Owl
Your a wizard Harry!
Any 11 year-old kids living near? They may have gotten a letter...
Are you Harry Potter?
Harry Potter. That is your letter to Hogwarts
Now it has seen you.
Someone in your neighborhood is getting their letter to Hogwarts 🤔
He really is looking like “You weren’t supposed to see me”
11th birthday?
Free security system, who’s complaining?
Is that house where harry potter lives now? The more you know🌈🌟
Brining you a letter from Hogwarts?
Happy sighting! 🦉
Most likely this hour came into the community and scared away the old owl install that I was home because that other I will super secretive so you can tell this towel is not the same hour because he’s like hey what’s up where is the other owl was always hiding
I hear one at least twice a week. On every tuesday a big ass mexican parrot perches up on top of tall tree and makes velociraptor noises.
Tonight is the year that you finally find your invitation to hogwarts, I hope that under the stairs cubby isn't a big deal
But did you get your Hogwarts letter?
Check your mail for a letter from Hogwarts.
Looks like a real r/superbowl
Well, did you check to see if it left anything in the mailbox?
[deleted]
Who?
hey neighbor! just saw this on next door
That’s no owl, that’s a wizard
If you HOOOO, they’ll hooooo back
That's HEDWIG👌🏾
I live in northern Indiana and the winter of 2019 I was walking to the store next to my neighborhood while it was snowing. I was fortunate enough to see a large snowy owl fly to the top of a tall pine tree where it perched and looked right at me. Ill remember that moment for the rest of my life.
well，Harry，it's finally here
Why nobody is talking about Hogwarts here
Looking at you like whoooooo are you?
I have a beautiful barn owl who swoops over my garden every night. I got a security camera installed last year and he sets it off every night between 2 and 3 am looking at the light in the reflection!
Who?
Fun fact- there’s a lot of people who mistake owl hoots for mourning dove calls :3
Mrs Mogonagal
Not the first time he’s seen you.
Do you know THE FOURTH KIND? :((
Who?
So cute bird!
 They are incredible creatures! Babies are so beautiful before they get their feathers. I live in a rural area and see these sights every day.
That a got damn lechusa witch bird don't respond to it damb thing is evil!!!!
Man that’s a real hoot
Who?
You're a wizard u/seisonoio

Check the letter box! You might have received a letter from Hogwarts.

I'm curious.  What time did you take the picture and with what type of camera?
He decides whoever sees him
It came to deliver the acceptance letters to Hogwarts
It's time
r/superbowl
In Potawatomi culture seeing an owl is a bad omen. Still cool nonetheless.
How do you know it’s the same owl though
Good luck @ Hogwarts
He's there to drop off a Hogwarts letter ✉️
O’rly I guess no ones seen The Forth Kind.
lol nice
So, did you get the letter?
And it sees you
Harry Potter is that you?!!!!!!! Says the owl
Looks like straight out of a Harry Potter movie. Love it!
Hdy you going to Hogwarts
I have a couple of Horned Owls that hang out in my yard. Usually they do the whole “who who hoohoo” thing, but once in a while one of them will start to free-style - more like “ooooh whacka whakka whakka ooh ooh ooooh”. Cracks me up every time.
Creepy afff 😬
“Yer a wizard, ‘arry”
looks like u are getting letters from Hogwarts  XD
He/she sees you too
Do you live on Privet Drive?
Any letter from Hogwarts?
That’s funny, I just saw the owl that’s been in our yard for the first time on Saturday. I guess they’re making themselves known...
Someone just got their invitation to Hogwarts.
Do you live on privet Drive?
Congratulations on your invitation to Hogwarts!
Looks like U are about to get your letter to Hogwarts
Yer a wizard Harry
We don't have neighborhood owls, outside of the one or two who take residence in our local bog. We do have a local woodpecker that I would love to see and hear daily in the park near my house.
Where is your Hogwarts invitation letter
Congratulations on your acceptance to Hogwarts!
Where are you Harry Potter...
The Ministry heard American muggles trying to fux the US Postal Service.
Did he also bring your Hogwarts letter?
Someone is finally getting accepted to Hogwarts!!
So, finally got your letter, ey?

If it weren't for the security tag this picture would look straight out the movies!
Well get ready you're having a baby. Mark my words.
Looks like you're going to Hogwarts...
All I can think about is it going for your head. Be careful! https://thisiscriminal.com/episode-one-animal-instincts-1-31-2014-2/

Probably a different one to the one you heard, there is a lot of owls.
It’s delivering a letter.
Someone just got accepted to Hogwarts.
You're a wizard, OP.
Calling you to join University of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Did you check your mailbox?? I think your letter from Hogwarts just arrived.
We hear one in the summer, but never saw it. Saw one of the smaller ones (saw-whet) only once during a snowstorm flying back and forth to our rear deck to eat dry cat food. It was a surreal sight.
You'll be receiving your invitation to Hogwarts soon
Harry potter vibes
Was it time for your hogwarts letter?
