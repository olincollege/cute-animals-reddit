Fun fact baby otters are more buoyant because of their coat. While the mother dives for food the baby will float at the surface. As the baby loses its coat the mother will start dunking the baby under so it will learn how to dive and look for food
The momma grabbed and petted him to comfort him thats adorable as hell
Love how the sweet mom is ready and swoops him up lovingly!
Aww the mummy rubbed the baby’s back and was all like ‘i got you i got you’ was the cutest!

doesn't look scared to me. Looks like its scratching itself and grooming its fur, then mom pulls it onto herself since that is where she kept him when it was younger
Why the dumb title?
Looks more like he's enjoying the sun and scratching his fur.
This is adorable.  But the caption is garbage.
It's like rolling over, but with extra steps.
IT’S SO FLUFFY I WANT TO HUG IT.
That’s the cutest thing I’ve seen on here in a while.

“I can do it x 100. Here I go. WAKANDA FOREV...Oh.”
3 assumptions in that title and I don't see any of em
The more otter I see, the more otter I want.
Momma to the rescue with encouraging words and a helping hand.
If you're gonna repost, atleast repost it with sound lol.
I just wanna pick him up and snuggle him.  So adorable🥰
/r/gifsThatStartTooEarly
He doesn’t appear scared, struggling or just realizing he floats for the first time. I hate shit titles like this, karma farmer.
A zoologist friend once told me “don’t let the cuteness fool you, otters are assholes.”
That little arm patting him
Love how he just goes limp and looks like a stuffed toy .. so sweet
Literally no part of this title is true
So many things wrong with this title.
It looks like it was enjoying boardwalk scritches and such and then accidentally fell off.
That is Hairy Otter!
My username became reality.
Otters are actually the best animal. They literally hugged there. Also did you know otters have a Little Rock that they keep in a pocket made of fur that they keep forever and they use it as a toy and use it to open food. Sometimes it is passed down through generations of otters. This one rock is so special to them that they sleep with it sometimes!!
Fluffy water puppy!
This needs sound, this is fucking adorable!
Wow.. that’s a lot of assumptions in one title. 
I like it when people assume what they think animals are doing is actually what the animals are doing. 
Thanks for sharing, though. The clip was aww-worthy.
Come on Emmitt time to get in the water.

I'm coming ma
I'LL TAKE YOUR ENTIRE STOCK
Otters are the best thing in the world aside from cats they're so cute and pure
Just what I needed to see. Now I feel happy!
That's otterly adorable.
"There, there."

-Mama Otter
I vote that we change the spelling of otter to awwtter.
This is otterly adorable. I'll leave now
No exaggeration, this is one of the cutest fucking things I’ve ever seen in my life.
THE WAY SHE RUBS HIS BELLY TO COMFORT HIM
This video is very cute, but people need to understand these animals need space!! Please give otters 60 feet of space when you can. Especially mothers with babies, they don’t need added stress.
I could cry. That's adorable
oh god what a great time to have eyes
Aww this made my day
My daughter approves and now wants to see one for real!
We all float down here
“Mama’s got you.”
This is absolutely the dumbest title I've ever seen on reddit.
Someone knows a whole lot about what that otter is thinking.
The mama was like “it’s ok I gotchu” 🥺🥺🥺
So cool
I love this so much
Mama's belly rub is always the best.
Nature is just amazing
Damn that is cute!
I love otters. I like how the mamas give their babies smol hugs.
This is the best thing I've seen today ❤️
That little reassuring rub at the end.💜💜💜💜
I MELTED AWAY WATCHING THIS. Thank you so much for sharing!!!
r/natureisfuckinglit
Otterly cute
That little back rub at the end tho...
oh how much i’d give to hug that little one 🥺
ugh, y'all she's not comforting him she's fluffing him up.
OMG. Where is this? Where can you see otters on a boat dock? I've been looking for them ever since they were reported south of Point Conception, and I've never seen one. I spent an entire day walking around Montana de Oro looking for them and all I saw were lumps of seaweed  or logs that kind of looked like otters bobbing around in the kelp beds.
So cute 😀
Otters are pretty neat
Otters couldn't get any cuter, could they?
There is a channel on YT with adoreable footage of them. Check out "Connie Levenhagen Niemi". She is the master photographer of these beauties
 Enjoy.
An otter being afraid of water would be like a bird being afraid of heights.
Monterey Bay?
FUCK YOU NATURE!!! that momma otter grabbing her baby and stroking him and comforting him! FUCK OFF! I can't handle it!!!!
[Video with baby squeaking](https://youtu.be/Yl6zZEHBHwE)
BIG FLOOFY WATER WEASEL! I LOVE HIIIIIIIIIIM!
Fun Fact: I float on the surface too because of my tummy fat.
"Son I told you that you float, now come on daylight is burning"
That mama otter tho ... so relieved her pup is safe in her otter ams
I know this video has sound and you didn't include it smh
This is way too similar to me trying to get out of bed in the morning.
aww adorable sea cats, the parent even pets him at the end in the water
It feels like otters were specifically engineered to be the cutest things on this planet.
i love otters
That moment where momma rubs her baby before disappearing under the pier?  "It's ok, it's ok" is such universal parental love language.  Yeah, I went awwwwwwww.
That Mamas here pat at the end... My heart!
This is so adorable. I love otters so much ❤️
Hm
Otters are like water cats while sea lions are like water dogs
The way he falls off tho 💔💔💔
I want an otter.
L’otters are not afraid!
Reminds me of my corgi.
“Bring me the Time Child, and I shall crush his skull on my belly.”
Nah that's just me trying to get the right side of the blanket at 3 am
Jeezum why can't we have [Quokka](https://i.imgur.com/4b4irGo.jpg)
Otters are fuzzy??
"Momma gotchu"
The comforting rub the mother gave was AWWesome
The ending was really sweet
Sweet merciful Jesus. That’s the cutest thing I’ve seen in a long time.
This made me smile
i don’t think i’ve ever seen a dry otter. but i’m glad i have now
The way the mom comforted him when he jumped made my heart stop ✨
Alright now it's time for Reddit to tell me that a pet Otter would be bad.
I CAN'T SWIM I CAN'T SWIM I CAN'T - ***oh... huh, dang i float***
Fear keeps sis safe but it also stops us from moving forward.
Can someone please turn this video into a channel because I need a more convenient way to watch this forever
I’ve come from the deepest corners of Reddit r/fiftyfifty
The way the mother pets the baby after she carries him on her stomach :’) “it’s okay mommas got you”
Smol
Animals are so cute
Awww poor anxious baby
The way the mother rubs him for reassurance at the end <3
That sweet comforting hug it got did me in!!!
💕OMG, Papa's petting baby to reassure it as he swims away 😻
Awesome_Otter/Drunken_Otter would have loved this video. I can hear her "d'aww"ing as I type this :')
This title is pure conjecture, as if that weeks/months old otter has never been in the water before.
I love how she strokes his side to calm him down after she pull him on her chest. Kinda 
Ike, “there, there...it’s ok!”
I understand you're just going for internet points, but this is a stupid title. It's scratching itself on the rough wood surface. This is why anthropomorphism gets a bad name.
This is stupid cute, you can do it lil brudder!
RIVER PUPPY
Every new thing is scary the first time around. Brave floof faced its fears!
The mother just rubbing the baby otter like “there there, it’s okay, you’re fine”

so cute
She comforts him when he’s finally in the water🥺
I like how the mom pet it like “there there it’s ok”
The mom is trying to turn the otter over so it can learn to float but it's not getting it so she scoops him up.
That title is so made up
It's interesting how all mammals at least - share pretty much the same methods of calming down like petting, piling on top of eachoter, licking (*kisses*), or releasing trauma like "shaking it off", flopping like seen here, or vocalizing.

Guess my point is that these behaviours are so incredibly deeply rooted that we all need to remember these "methods" if we want to stay sane in a digital world. More petting, more shaking it off, more "chilling in a big pile" weather with friends of family or a pet.
Why make up this fake narrative? Baby otter completes carpentry work on new dock.  Before heading home, he gives it one last pass for a quality inspection.
‘’You are coming with me, young man’’
Adorable :3
The lil "your ok bud, momma's got ya" pat by the momma is sooo sweet..
The way his mum cuddles and strokes him after like "it's okay! It's okay! You're fine! Mummy's here" absolutely broke me. Nature is so beautiful.
Is there a sound version of this? I need to hear otter chirps
Otters are so incredibly cute
how did baby get all the way up onto the dock?
Mother otters look so affectionate towards their babies. Its so cute
The mom patting his back is killer
I love otters I just wanna cuddle them
I would die for this bb
ʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっʕっ•ᴥ•ʔっ
I started as an Otter now Im'a deer.
it looks like one of those "wooly bear" caterpillars
I’m a grown-ass man and I just made some weird sound in front of my coworkers that was like an “awe” but during a seizure.
All made possible with otters' help
Good mummy otter! You are amazing.
This deserves to go in the r/eyebleach subreddit.

This made me feel so happy! 😍
I think he was just distracted honestly
footage shows only one thing that is cuter than a puppy; and that is a baby otter 😍💕
That’s a buoyant boi
Otters as so cute
There's a 24/7 live feed of the life of an orphaned baby otter's life in care on YT, just search for it. His name is Joey iirc.
hope there's no predators around where this lovely family chills.
OP’s username was very unexpected lol
Awww
Baby otters are FLUFFY??? Holy hell, I now have a new cute animal obsession! I mean I wanted an otter before I found out about this fluffiness...but now!
This is LIFE. 
You are capable of more than you realize. Just do it.
Bay-bee Otter doo-do-do-doo-doo!
IDUNWANNAIDUNWANNAIDUNWANNAI- oh, this isn’t too bad.
Baby sea dog
They’re so cute til you figure out that Otters are serial killing necrophiliacs
Love the momma otter reaction like omg I'm so proud of you.
[It’s so fluffy, I’m gonna die!](https://youtu.be/tt6FPKyQamk)
She rubbed his little back 🥺
What is the largest species of otter? I saw a group of otters the other day that were absolutely giant, easily 5ft long in the water. They grunted a bunch and snorted like dogs, made me think it was probably a pack of males. I dont think they were the same species as these cute little guys, does anyone know about different otter species?
That little back rub was the cherry on top
Moms are the best
It seems too big to not know that it floats.
Cute little sucker Hahahah
Time to go do some otter stuff
Or because the water is dirty?
So scared he went in butt first
Aw the amount of anxieties lol
The mother!
I never realized I needed a baby otter.
Mom caught the baby? Awesomeness!
Mama has you, sweetheart! ♥️ 🦦
-angry crying- that’s so FUCKIN cute
Awwww the momma putting the baby on her belly and giving little pats was too precious
r/killthecameraman
Please talk to me again.
Good god that animal is cute.
That is adorable 😍
> parrots don’t move the needle.
I love watching otter moms!
Well that's the cutest thing I'm going to see all day
GET OUT OF THERE YOUR SURROUNDED
This was the sweetest thing ever! Mama’s love. 🥰
It’s so fluffy I’m gonna DIE!!!!!
This is definitely a metaphor for my life right now.
thats soooooo cute!
just throw the otter in the water smh
I want to be an otter
What a floofy little fuzzball
Isn’t nature wonderful ❤️
I am severely disappointed that there's no audio. This is too cute to be completely silent D:
Momma looks so proud awww
It’s all good... I got ya.
i remember when i was a kid, maybe 15 years ago or more, i saw these 2 otters at the oceanarium here in lisbon, and they were rubbing their faces. i distinctly remember thinking that was the cutest thing i had ever seen in my life, and from then on i just knew otters were the cutest animals on earth

&#x200B;

this video just cements that experience.

otters are amazing
This video is adorable but there's absolutely no way that a baby otter doesn't realize it can float. That's like a human being not realizing it can breathe. An otter being in water is deeply ingrained into its DNA memory.
Honestly this is a dumb question. I have not even once thought about till now because I’ve never seen it. What preys on otters? To me it seems like nothing?
Omg squeeeeee! Precious baby💖
I would die for this creature.
If it doesn’t float the gulag should have it’s back
Well, now I can honestly claim that I swim like an otter.
There are so many otter posts here now and I love it
I sometimes too feel like a baby otter in these trying times
This is what I needed to relax. Thanks.
Like my kids not wanting to take a bath
That's the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen!
I’ve seen some floaters in my time but none so cute as this one.
There is nothing cuter than baby otters. This is adorable!
"I'm not a boyant, i'm an Otter!"
Sweet baby❤️
Awww 🥰
Thank you for providing me hugging otters for today :)
It's not scared, it's just playing around.
Omg it’s so dang cute 😭💜
So cute!
I love the little mama pets at the end as she goes under the dock lol
We all float down here
Like a bird being scared of heights
Omg so precious
The cuddles at the end are the cutest thing.
It is decided when I am reincarnated it will be an otter.  The babies have the most caring mothers and what could be more fun, eating clams, laying on mom's tummy, taking off and swimming deep in ocean. Best of both worlds, if you like seafood.  They even strive to have fun in captivity, my kind of kinship. I want to be a silly otter and bite people.
Bad title, cute video.
I love otters!
Fun fact: This is exactly how I get out of bed in the morning.
Those cute little eyes
This is the cutest thing I've seen since I had to go to work and leave my kitties at home! It's so fluffy!
Wow I didn't realize how cute they were when they are dry. I'm actually one of the people that don't think otters are cute, never seen one dry though
/u/vredditshare
He is so cute
Holy shit, it's so adorable how the mom grabs it and hugs it while swimming around
When she popped him onto her belly and started giving him good job cuddles 🥺
That’s otterly adorable.  Aye que rico!
He otter be braver next time.
HES SO FLUFFYYY
Pennywise likes this.
Piers are cool
So fluffyyyy!!!!🤩🤩 😖😖😖
whole lot of assumptions being made about what that otter is feeling
There are 69 awards
Dude otters are the cutest animals ever
u/vredditshare
GET IN YOUR ROOM!
This is to pure for this world
*Baby otter lays on dock until it gets back in the water.
Just realized I’ve never seen a dry otter.
The life saving part is adorable.
And I just wish I could have taught him to swim.
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwww
This is otterly adorable!
THE TUMMY RUB WHEN THE LIL BABY FELL IN THE WATER didn’t think I was going to cry today thank you
I would be scared too of jumping in that water
Baby sea otters aren’t scared of water, they’re born in water, real question here is why in the hell is that baby dry, on the pier, and not being cradled by momma
The little pats the mama gives as they go under the dock!! So comforting!!
River puppo
Baby otters needs to be taught how to swim. They don't just naturally do it automatically.
So fluffyyyyy
I need to cuddle him
Heart = complete
/u/vredditshare
I love otters 💕
Life lesson: we don't know what we're capable of unless someone who believes in us shows us the way.
Notice mama petting and comforting her baby as she swims away. Awww!
Oh my gosh, this is just the cutest thing I've ever seen! And I swear it looked like mom clapped her hands after baby fell into the water.
And this is how cats happened.
TIL otters do breaststroke legs while on their backs
Mom Otter: "GOOD JOB, BUDDY!"
Otter: water is my element!
Also otter: *OH GOD NO WATER*
Oh god, this video has been popping in my youtube recommended list nonstop for the past week. Now it’s in my reddit feed.
“Well, shit!”
Kinda looks like the gopher from caddy shack
So funny.
This is sooo floofing adorable 😍😍❤️❤️
This boy has Otto from pajama sam energy
I would of been like yeeeeet lol
I gotchu buddy
The person taking this video got way to close to this otter! It is stressful and harmful to wildlife to get close to them like this. Also, sea otters have a nasty bite!
Sea caterpillar
Didn't realize full grown otters were that big!
Took me quite some time to find its head
I swear to god if any one has even the idea to make this creepy I will find you
Omg the way she rubs him 😭😭😭
damn coulda made a nice snack
Mommy! -Baby, probably.
u/erwin_cov08
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwewwww, he's sooooooooo cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
But poor baby, cinnamonbun.
Awwww!!
This is one of my all time favorite videos.
u/savethisvideo
“Scared of water”? No. Not at all. Otters are not scared of water. 

“Struggles”?! ... “doesn’t realize”?! Do you write headlines for the NY DAILY POST? 

Did you interview the otter? 

Baby otters are typically left on boats, piers or rocks for safety from predators or injury from boaters by their mothers as she hunts for food. That’s why when she reappears, the baby hears her and just rolls off and plops into the water to be near its mother. 

It floats because its fur is the densest in the animal kingdom. It has nothing to do with “realizing.” 🙄
He floats
u/savethisvideo
Many things aren't as scary as it seems if we are willing to try. :)
I I
TIL baby otters have a fur coat.
😍
Wow...

I never realized they were so floooofy when dry.
gd gd
I think it's more due to the fact that the fall is like 3 times its height.
So fluffy
That’s otterly adorable
An actual audible aww came out of me at the end of this.
Fear personified
Awhh
Do otters know they are cute? If they don't, we need to some how let them know.
He met a salesman.
We all float down here!
/u/otterHooligan
I loved his earlier work in Caddyshack.
Daddy's taking him for a swim
Yeah... I don't see how you came to that conclusion.
The mother otter was rubbing the baby....wtf lol
Is he “scared of water” “struggling” and “doesn’t know he can float” or was he just waiting for his mom to come back?
Ok.

I'm getting closer. 

*breathes heavy*

Closer.

Getting there.

*breathing intensifies*

Oh boy, oh boy.

Closer-

Ahhhhhhhh
Is no one going to talk about how dirty the water is :(
Nothing of what you said in the title happens... It doesn't act scared at all, it doesn't struggle to roll off the pier and has obviously been in water already so it's fully aware that it floats.
You're either astoundingly stupid and/or lying for worthless internet points.

Reddit is so good at watching a clip, and then completely misunderstanding what's going on, even for basic stuff with humans. It must be so weird to have that level of a reality bending filter and not being able to understand things the way they happen without twisting the events and shoving in your own shitty meanings. 
You could place a banana in front of so many people and their reaction would be "weird yellow vegetable has fallen on its side, put there by a endangered parrot species as a mating gesture" (and the whole parrot thing being completely made up for karma, because disgusting schmucks are gonna do what they always do).
I’d be scared to jump in that nasty looking water too
Weird. It moves vaguely like a maggot at the start.
What a dumbass
Help it you monster
What a dumb title, baby otter knows it floats and is not scared of water, lol. Anything to make it more dramatic right?
And a downvote for the bad title full of lies
Sea otters give birth in the water.  It knows it floats.
Nice! But why is the water so dirty? That is unsafe
[deleted]
This is disgusting. This otter is actually having a seizure and yall are watching it for entertainment. Luckily the parent knows what's up and saves it from drowning.
