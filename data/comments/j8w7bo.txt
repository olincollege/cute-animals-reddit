That‚Äôs a Tufted Titmouse. They often flock with chickadees and other songbirds. Their songs sound like they are saying ‚ÄúPeter-Peter-Peter‚Äù. They also really like sunflower seeds.

Pretty sure that's a tufted titmouse. You can tell by the way all the comments are telling you it's a tufted titmouse.
Titmouse
Here's an actual [baby woodpecker](https://scontent.fagc3-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/33766486_10155371130167050_2009739214979072000_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_sid=730e14&_nc_ohc=qmuE6RooIqMAX-PQPxy&_nc_ht=scontent.fagc3-1.fna&oh=80dfa156b8f93bb4e1703afbcac2dd40&oe=5FA7B5F8)
I think it means you're a Disney princess now
This is actually a tufted titmouse! Super cute!
Tufted Titmouse, but you're very lucky.
How the fuck does everyone know what a tufted titmouse is???
It‚Äôs a borb
It's a Titmouse above your weenus.
Not a woodpecker, that my friend is a Tufted Titmouse
[deleted]
Ah, what a pleasant little nugget
Welcome to bird watching, or birding. Tufted titmice are fun to watch, but when I had an actual juvenile downy woodpecker around all he did was peck at my metal drain pipes, the steel screws in my fence, and the MDF that my siding is made out of. Fortunately, his parents swooped down to inform him that I am a threat, and he should never be within the three feet he was from me.
Angry Birds 3 movie went for live action I see
that's a tufted titmouse not a woodpecker
Has anyone mentioned that it's not a woodpecker yet?
Hes a little chonk. Precious peep.  ‚ù§
Tufted Titmouse. Neat little guys. Love those and chickadees.
Are you a Disney princess? <3
A bird called titmouse, I mean... They were setting us up there
If the bird feeders run out these guys chase my dad around the yard chirping at him until he refills.
Titmouse
And then he starts to punch your arm with hus beak
That‚Äôs a titmouse bro not a woodpecker.
Deffo a titmouse!
Tufted titmouse not a woodpecker, but who that is adorable.
That looks nothing like pikipeck
Cuteness freaking over load!! (‚Äò‚óâ‚åì‚óâ‚Äô)
"I don't know my purpose, but I know I am small, and I shall fly awkwardly away from things that scare me. And everything scares me, because I am small."
You are now a Disney princess!
Chonk
It would be such an honour.
That's the cutest fucking bird I've ever seen.
SMOL BOI
For the many commenters who clocked in to tell OP that this is NOT a baby woodpecker and IS a tufted titmouse: s/he is aware of that. Calling it a baby woodpecker was a joke. It looks the way a wee woodpecker would if a woodpecker would look wee. Also, note the footnote.
Honestly what about that bird made you think it's a woodpecker at all?
That is a Tufted Titmouse. Not a woodpecker. Still, so cute.
Happy to see how many people knew this was a tufted titmouse. Upvotes for all of you!
Holy shit thats cute!

It‚Äôs a tufted titmouse!
be careful! it may or may not peck your wood
Looks a bit more like a tufted titmouse.
Omg he‚Äôs so plump and cuuuute!!! ^^
That's an adult tufted titmouse!
Titmice are a family of birds. I forgot what language, but in some language tit is bird and mouse is small. So titmouse basically translates too small bird.
titmice are some of the coolest birds to observe at a birb-feeder. They're unlike anyone else.
awwww

This is also not a baby tufted titmouse. This is an adult tufted titmouse. 1) there are no babies in October. 2) in case this picture was taken in the spring, babies do not have that black forehead. Only adults have a black forehead.

Just as a recommendation look up the story of the extinct Ivory Billed Woodpecker and the rumors of some having been located. It's fun to look up the places they've been sighted on google earth and it makes you wonder...and hope..
 Cute!!!!

This guy‚Äôs underarm hair likely looks like a bird‚Äôs nest.
Beautiful photograph once in a lifetime moment captured on film incredible.

It‚Äôs amazing to see the advancement in technology of government drones. 

They‚Äôre just getting better and bolder. 

Now instead of just spying from afar they‚Äôve made designs attractive enough that humans accept not only their presence, but actually allow them to land right on them making it easier for the droneBot ‚Äúbird‚Äù to collect DNA samples (tissue samples are no doubts captured by the ‚Äúbirds‚Äù claws to be uploaded to the black ops database for, as of yet... unknown reasons).

We are truly living in an incredible time in history the technological advancements are simply mind bending.
