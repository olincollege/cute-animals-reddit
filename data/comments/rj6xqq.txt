That's unfairly cute...
Look at the size of those paws, he's going to be a big boy.
Honestly I could watch this for hours.
Holy fucking shit it's so god damn cute!!!!! I just want to hold it and pet it forever!!!!!!
My heart cannot handle this level of cute!!
He really went 🥺
Purrrfect 🥺
OMG even cuter with the audio on. I didn't know baby cats also sucked on their hands 🥺
Cuteness overload!!
This was posted the other day, I am curious as to what OP gets from stealing and reposting other people's pets.
That’s usually a sign that the kitty was taken from their mother too early. Cute as hell, but also a bit sad.
It almost looks like CGI
The puppy-eyes! Omg what a cutie.
Unmuting is ten x better
"
What’s his name? Nom nom? Lol
Okay i know this looks cute but i had a cat that wouldn't ever stop kneading/sucking my blanket when I was trying to sleep and it was SO ANNOYING
I showed my cat this. She was just as confused as I.
A) this has been reposted sooo many times

B) that’s not healthy behavior for a cat. It can damage the paw
Thank you :)) I needed that level of cuteness today!
He is a beautiful baby.
Jfc nobody should be allowed to be that cute wtf.
It's not cute this cat was taken from it's mother too early and is way too old to be suckling anything much less it's own hand. This is a sign issues.
Baby kitteh

I love the sound it makes.
This is so adorable 🥺 i wish I have an award to give but take this upvote for the meantime
Sooo cute !
toe beans don't give milk, little one
Our massive pawed Chonky boy does this to soothe himself to sleep. It’s adorable 😁
so sweet.
All your other content stolen too OP?
That's cute. 

Very cute in fact.

Infact it's so cute my heart skipped a beat.

I also smiled because it was so cute.

But i don't have a cat? So it's also depressing.

Fuck, Life is fucking depression.

But cute cat tho.
Oh my god what a fucking precious angel
Straight to cute jail.
Oh my gawwd. He’s beautiful.
Love you
Cat ASMR
Hippity hoppity your cat is now my property
Was he taken early from his mother or something?  A part of me feels like this shouldn’t happen.
Am I the only one in this thread whose misophonia is triggered by this? I love cats more than anything, but the sound of this one sucking on its paw makes my skin crawl (the sound of dogs and cats cleaning themselves does this for me too).
I am obsessed
Awwww the cats so cute
I Love this vídeo, thank you
Literally made my day
Thank you

My little baby boy (who is almost 9 now) has a little stuffed frog toy that we got for him when he was a kitten. The frog's eyes bulge out in somewhat of a mammary fashion.. And since day one, he's enjoyed "nursing" on his frog while kneeding his paws.

Certain times of the day, every day, you can hear him somewhere in the house begin to shout and meow and howl while he carries his frog to find someone to snuggle with while he nurses his frog. (he's part siamese so you can imagine how loud the announcement of nursing time is).

He's a goofball. But I love him dearly.

This may be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life.
Oh my goodness. Melts my heart
Never knew cats would such on their toes.
Such a cute kitty!
Oooooohhhhhhhmmmmmmmyyyyyyyyyggggooooooooooddddddddssssssss
That. Is. So. FUCKING. CUTE.
Make a sub with just cats sucking their paws
Man I uploaded that MONTHS ago but it got removed. How come yours is still up. Rigged
Thats a weird wabbit
I’m no scientist, but I’m sure that’s a cat
I love it when tuna gets stuck between my toes
Why do I love this
This would literally end wars. Hate just doesn't exist after looking in those eyes.
That is fucking adorable
Why is he so fanny xD
I don't like cats, but this is really cute.
I was not ready for that cuteness.
Is excessive sucking a stress thing in cats like it is with some other animals?
This is how they get you to stop the earth's rotation.
I just... I just can't get over HOW CUTE THIS CAT IS!
What is the cat doing?
Insert Maggie Simpson noises…
That sound!! It's so freaking adorable!!
I refuse to be embarrassed about the noise I just made.
Grond
This video is the entire point of the Internet.  We are done now.
mm
When my cat was a baby, the whole litter was separated from the mom super early. For a while she could only fall asleep if she suckled on the top of her paw similar to this.
❤
He is so cute
What a gorgeous baby, melting my frozen heart ♥️
This is the cutest damn thing I’ve seen all week
Hi Baby!
Oh my goodness what an absolute earth Angel 😍😍😍
I have a year and a half old kitty. He has done this since the first day when I took him home. Every morning he crawls on my chest and does this while purring his loudest. I absolutely love it and hope he never stops doing this.
Omg I died. This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen!
I really truly don’t believe I have ever in my life seen anything cuter than this…
OK my heart just melted❣️
r/unexpectedasmr
Question.  What breed is he?
Or kitten, even?
Top 5 r/aww
So sweet and cute!
That audio should be used for a horror movie
AAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
Not to be dramatic but I would die for this animal!
Adorable, I needed to see this after just thinking about my cat I used to have, 2 years now since she has been gone. I miss her so much I could cry.
Tabbies tear my heart out. This is now the second Reddit video I've ever saved. Thx!
Sir suckles!
Is he sucking his thumb?
Aweeee… he’s sucking his thumb! Adorable
🥺
Suckin' on the beans.
This made my heart melt.
I had a cat that would do this with her back paw and then make biscuits at the same time... And yes I said cat. She did it her entire life.
In cat years he's 34 and he needs to go get a job
I gotta draw this. So cute
That is weird AND cute
Ugh...my heart 💖
"I have to clean every inch of myself like this everyday. . . I don't get much else done really."
Is he under hypnosis? "You are now a human baby with thumbs."

Also, I think he wants you to suck on the other one. Just a guess.
IRL he is flipping us off and kissing it, just sayin’
Your hamster is looking a litte weird
Sooooo cuuute 🥰
OMGGG THIS IS THE CUTES THING I EVER SAW IN MY ENTIRE LIFEEEEEEE OMGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ah there it is, my daily dose of serotonin!
SUCC
Looks hungry
that kinda reminds me of shock headed peter
Can I have him ?
He doesn’t even know his ABCs 🥺
A BEBBY

   I love it so much when they do that 🥰
Alright I'm gonna have to stop you right there, this is illegally cute
So precious
My heart just sploded.

Omggg so cute, my Milo does this but with a little duck stuffed animal 🥺🥺🥺

Why am I just sitting in this airport terminal with a giant smile behind my mask.... Ohh it's this
Dog guy here...That's the cutest cat video I have ever seen. I might have to switch teams.
Get this man some food...
You ever see something so cute it makes you cry? No? Just me?
Such a cutie!
Toe beans
I think that is officially the cutest thing I have ever seen.
😻
Oh my god 😍
I need the save video bot but i dont know how can someone help me?
So cute. The cheek pulsing is just so adorable.
 🥺 I wanna snuggle this baby.
If this doesn't make top post of all time for this sub, then we've all lost our way.
I immediately feel a need to protect at all costs

Cuteness overload
I think I just got diabetes from this sweetness.
Give that boy a nipple.
Awwwwww so cuuuuuute ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
He's so tiny
This is so cute it hurts!
Exploring life at a young age.
HIIII BB KITTY
Pretty innocent looking
MMMMM MY HEART AAAA THE EYES! THE PAWS!!!
awh i want to give the kitty a soother
My grown up kitty does this still except she sucks on her bed because it's fluffy and presumably reminds her of her mama
Omg😻 I could watch this all day
Toe beans
Num num num num
I needed to see this right now. So cute!!!
More of this please ❤️
A pox on that phony king of England!
😁So cute I dedicate this song to u from [Anjalts](https://music.anjalts.com/touchngo)🔥Happy holidays
r/cute
Is this little guy suckling on his own paw?
This kitten needs milk.
he eatin jelly beans LOL
This is quite possibly the most adorable cat video I've ever seen. (That is saying quite a lot)
I want to give him snuggles now
Love the sound!
u/download
So cute. Looks kinda like my kitty
I mean, if I had toe beans that smelled like Fritos, I'd be doing the same!
This is wow
My poor little pazuzu did this with his favorite toy sadly because of FIP we were forced to put him down at 7 1/2 months old. I’ve never been more messed up by having to euthanize a pet before. I mean I’m always devastated when I’ve had to say goodbye to a fur baby, but they’ve always been elderly and very sick having lived a long fulfilling life. Our poor precious pazuzu didn’t even get to finish being a baby before we had to say goodbye :(
I think he might have a flea between his toes.
❤️
10 seconds is cool, but 20 seconds? This kitty is outta control
Must adopt
This is literally maximum cuteness there can be no cuteness above this
I had a kitten that did that!!!
What a cute kitty
So Cute 💞
Does he pay you with blocks?
Cute face
 Aww, my cat does this too🥺
He's just a baby...

HI BABY!!!
I've never seen a cat suck it's thumb!! This is so precious 😻
Awe 😍
My cat climbs up to my shoulder and does this on my earlobe. Then kneads into my neck/shoulder. Cutest thing
👉👈🥺🥺🥺🥺 I need to hug hims
Pawcifier
OH MY GOHD
Adorable!
i would scream if my cat did this
awww, melted my heart
you definitely fuck your cats
Cta
I love cta
Omg awwww is right! The little sucking noises
Aw
Those 👀! ❤️
That’s the real puss! 😃🥰😍😆
Sucking on his toebeans? 😍
Is this guy sucking his paws like a kid sucks its thumb?
My heart is broken
This is so god damn cute it’s pissing me off
Awwwwww! ❤️
It sounds like he’s walking on sand in minecraft
AHHHHHHH TOO MUCH CUTENESS!!!!!! I’m ok now
/savevideo
He needs a pacifier 🙂
Mop
DOOOOOOIIIIIITTTTTT
My cat did this as kitten I found a baby pacifier cause she made sores on her paw
I know the Internet find this behavior very cute, but the nursing on paws or blankets means a kitten was taken from its mother too early. 

No well adjusted cat will do this.
Welcome to Saturday.
I wish my cat would do that, instead he nurses on my arms and digs his darn claws into my skin.
He has the sweetest face 🥺
Those EYES! Absolute cute.
Well my heart just melted.
One of my cat still does this on my bearded chin.
You should name him Prince John!
Anybody else automatically blink back at this lil cutie each time they blinked? Where my slow blink gang at.
I've never seen a post with this many upvotes in my life.  It deserves every single one of them.
Those cute innocent eyes.
Well shit give him a bottle 🍼
Doesn't this usually mean they were taken from the mom too soon as a baby?
Not cute, irresponsible. This cat wasn't properly weened from its mother
Omg
He’s so cute
Such a cute creature, I love cats.
Awww, how cute!!!
kitty do be beat boxing
Looks just like my little rescue boi. Awww
Bless him
Pleaseeee i need this video! Where can i download it?
When I get done eating Cheetos
weened too soon from mommy :(
Making sure those beans are pristine
😹
You don’t understand!  He is not *sucking* on his claws… he is *sharpening* them!

*cat eyes owner from across the room*
Cat thumb sucking will always be more adorable than a human baby.
cute
That's not a kitten, that is a really well disguised assassin! Where are the defibrillators!?
Cute! Never seen a cat do that
My sisters cat used to do this. ❤
Had a cat that did this. Vet said it usually means they were taken away from their mother too early
Yes he is!

I have an adult kitty that suckles, but only in her sleep!
OMFG I'M FUCKING DYIIIIIING IT'S TOO CUTEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
No lie, this is the cutest thing I've ever seen in my life. This is the definition of cuteness. Omg.. mind-numbingly adorable!
forgot it was time to repost this again
This is one of the cutest things I’ve ever fucking seen. 🥲
So goddamn adorable

Quentin Tarantino cat.
This is one of the cutest things i’ve ever seen
a wee nail biter
The cute… I can’t… oh god make it stop….
One of my cats used to do this way into “adulthood” then she just suddenly stopped
without the sound it looks like he's beatboxing
Awwww the cute
Right after tearing the back of your sofa up, pissing on the carpet, and dragging a dead bird into the house lol
Omg 😍
He's so cute😄😍
Omg just when I thought it couldn't get cuter, that baby lifted that other paw up!
I’ve never seen this type of behaviour before. Super cute.
High hitler
Awww. In love with those eyes 🥺 🐾
Oops
So is this the equivalent of sucking your thumb as a toddler?
This is the cutest kitty
My cat who recently passed did this when she was a kitten.
Get those nails clean darling
OH MY GOD
Omg
My jaw literally dropped at how stinkin' cute this little guy is :O
If that's not ASMR I don't know what is.
Omg so cute lol
This made me cry!! My boy who passed two years ago looked just like this cat and also did this when he was a kitten. I miss Roscoe so much!
Anybody else hate this sound with all of their lifes?
Cute baby lion
very cute
We must protect this little fur ball at ALL COSTS!
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes) awe... so cute!
ye
He’s gonna get a paw or nail bed infection
Isn't this the sort of behavioural issues cats do if they've been seperated from their mum too soon so they didn't get to drink milk?

I'm no expert or anything, but I feel like I've read that before.
OMG AWWWWW ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Those eyes! Beautiful.
My 11y old used to do this a lot too, I love that sound, it's weirdly cute
ADORABLE!
Omg he’s like the lion from Disney’s Robin Hood XD
Aww so adorable sweet baby I’d love to have this baby
Omg so cute
Is this the genuine audio?  It sounds unnaturally loud, almost like someone is mimicking the noises they imagine with their mouth, but it also could just be a really sensitive mic.
So cute
Cute but sounds kinda gross, but he’s so cuuuute
P U S S Y E A T I N G P U S S Y
OMG 😱  so cuteeeee
I think I just melted.
Oh!! What a cutie. I need a pet.
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I thought this was absolutely adorable and couldn't get any cuter....until I turned the sound on and watched it again 🥺🥺🥺
This is what the internet was made for.
Aww
If I saw this irl I would literally fucking die
Oh my goodness, that is adorable.
That one eyed wink shit gets me every damn time! Lil bastard. 🤣
I can't understand how a creature is allowed to be this cute
I will kiss that cat so hard
May be this cute baby hiding something in his mouth
Too freaking cute!!
Awww
Disney: Real cats aren't expressive!  
Real cats:
That’s hilarious 😆
That is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen but I kinda feel bad for him— that means he was taken from his mama too early to be sold.
That might be the cutest fucking thing I’ve seen my entire life. I’m in love!
He’s gonna need braces when he’s older
I would commit atrocities for this little boy. All he would have to do is look at me like this and whisper, "exterminate the chechens" and it'd be off to Chechnya I'd go. You can't deny this face. I'd launch a crusade just to make this face happy, my will wrapped around this little demon's paw.
Can't leave it at 666 likes, so cute
Awww
this is so sweet 🥺 my baby looks just like him but he suckles on my finger instead of his toes. he’s 8 months now and he’s been doing it since we got him at 3 weeks old
Cuteness overload
Okay, this is possibly the CUTEST FREAKING VIDEO I HAVE EVER SEEN.
Soft kitty warm kitty little ball of fur
Soft kitty warm kitty purr purr purr
Little kitty is Hypnotizing the owner
Content with being loved 
I love it when cats and kittens do that stretching thing with there fingers open wanting a paw rub 🐱🤗🤗
Get this baby a teat asap!
Those sound effects are really annoying.
Love this cat.
That's way fking too cute!!!!
This is not cute. This is a common trait that develops in kittens if separated too early from their mother.
I will give you $1000 to cat sit!!
OMFG that is so freakin adorable ❤️
I heard that they usualy did this because they were seperated from their mother too early

Sorry to be the party pooper
He is so cute.
The little suckling sounds.
its just a baby!! hi baby!!!
Give me more 😳. Just too cute.
He needs a binky 😊
I LOVE him!!! 💘💕💘
You need to protect it’s little beans when a cat does this. The toe will become raw very quickly.
Omg! I’m gonna die from cute overload.
You’re so silly!
I love him so much
My cousin had a kitten that did this. It unfortunately drooled while doing it, but it was easily overlooked with all that baby cuteness. But I understand the behavior continued into adulthood, when it became a lot less cute.
This is the freakin’ cutest thing I have seen all day!!!!  😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻😻
Omg, so precious. I want to puuritto them and smother them with kisses. STAT
No! This cat wants to extract pur plantiary rotational energy and transmitted  it to its home world. Not cat is that cut without a ulterior motive.
Omg I love him
Oh my goodness this is the cutest thing I’ve seen in my adult life
Ouch. It hurts how adorable that is
If I was just hearing this sound and not the video I’d imagine it’s something much more NSFW than cute
I do not need another kitten, I do not need another kitten, I do not need-
omg the baby
Owner with camera:  Look how precious my baby is.

Cat: Now if I can get this paw wet enough I will be able to slap this crap right out of there hands.
he's auditioning for baby yoda
cronchcronchcronch
I had a cat who sucked her paw. So darn cute!!!
Cover all 9000 taste buds, airiate it, warm it up. That's a ten.
Dude this is torture i almost broke my phone my ape brain cant handle something that cute
Cuteness overloaded!
Well, you can tell he likes beans!
What kind of soul can make all night cats bow their heads to you.
STOP! YOU HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW BY BEING TOO CUTE!
"He poops in the corner in a box!"
My oxytocin levels 😭
Aww bean suckies
really nice cat
❤❤love her
This made my day, I was having an anxiety attacks all day and this made it much better. I overthink so much and the overthinking turns into anxiety attacks. But this baby cat made me feel very happy! THANK YOU! I LOVE THE CAT.
cool dog
I did this a lot!(many years before)
"I. Am. Bebeh!"
Grubbin
Awww there so cutee it should be a illegal to be that cute
My cat would do this to her tail. Funny she was siamese.
AY YO THIS CAT EATIN BEANS
We have a white kitty that does this. The vet told us it was like the biggest compliment a cat can give you if they’re comfortable enough to suck their toes in your lap
i think i might cry
I love cata but that sound is disgusting
Awwww
That's some r/Disneyeyes right there🥺🥺
Didn't know kittens suck on their paws. Thus is too cute.
If I put a comfy blanket on myself, then my cat on top of that, this is what he does to me/the blanket. He’s 9. 🥺😻
Furry Foot Fetishists Rejoice!
Well there it is. The cutest thing that has ever been posted on the internet. I can stop looking now.
Those beautiful eyes!
Omg what a wittle wuv bug 🥺
So is it licking its paw or what?
Someone setting me up. It does not look real
After a long fucking week of bull shit with work and someone smashing my car window and stealing my stuff. I needed this, thank you for posting.
Aww. So adorable. 🥰
hi baby 😍😍😍😍
There's something in its paw you asshole. Quit anthropomorphizing
how cute
Beautiful
Had a Siamese that did that. Initially cute but eventually annoying AF hearing it all the damn time morning and night.
This was like ASMR. The sound was so relaxing, lol.
i would sugar that sweet little baby UP 💋
Adorable :\]
I want to smush my face into it until we are one…
Reminds me of Disney's Robin Hood. Hey there prince John

Hello, I am Michal Theadore Mouse and that cat is just so extraordinarily cute! 🥰 Please let this cat have everything they shall ever want! That is the cutest cat I have ever seen!
The way those little eyes are twinkling. Too cute.
Taken too early from mom. So sad
This is my favorite Reddit post of all time
Such a cutie
That's not cute. I'm not smiling. Nope. Not cute
... Am I the only one who found the sound annoying?   😕
OMG that’s… I just can’t. That’s off the scale of cute.
So stinkin cute ahh!!!
Soo precious.
That is ungodly cute.
Aww
Are they eating their toe beans? (That is really all I can think of apart from how much their paws must itch if they’re like biting them like that…)
Pretty sure the audio is someone chopping lettuce up
Cutest thing ever
Jokes on you, she just stepped in your dinner
I have a tie sucker too. She’s 15. Her brother/litter-mate has no such habit.
Pure Love
My FUCKING HEAAAART IS MELTING
Cat ASMR.
I want that kitty
Omg my heart just melted i need to give it a kiss
How could anyone hate cats, this is the cutest thing
Must have had some kfc. Still finger lickin good…
This is farrr too adorable. I don’t know what to do. Contemplating calling the police.
This cat got OCD
Biggest deep fake of all but I love it.
Legal
Awwww 🥰 so stinking adorable
This is an amazing way to start my day
Sucking on his toe beans
I am leaving a comment so I can always find my way back
It’s annoying as shit and they won’t ever stop doing it.
This paw-sucker just made babies? He’s a baby himself lol
Look at him go!! Ladies you could learn from this
Pls step on it
Most nervous cat I've ever seen.
[deleted]
