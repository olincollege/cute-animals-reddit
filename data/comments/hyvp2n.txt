He just didn’t finish the sentence. “Keeping the kitten...out of my beard”
Those paws and claws
Dear God so fucking cute, that cat wants to live in the beard 😆
"it's so fluffy!" -the kitten, probably
I got that same cat! Was a dog person before getting him and now I'm converted. Just wait till those two bond even more, it'll be so precious. Cats get a bad rep for being assholes but the moment you meet a really nice and affectionate one it becomes obvious why so many people enjoy them.

This is a great clip!
r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
Ma’am you did not keep the kitten, the kitten kept your husband.
r/mensmittenwithkittens
In my experience there's no easier way to win over a guy with a beard than to appreciate his beard, and she seems to really love it. He was doomed from the start
It’s always so good when guys realize how happy they can be when they find a little critter to cuddle! 💕
Haha, that’s pretty sweet.
My boyfriend said the same thing when we found a 3 week old kitten in our yard. Same night I was having trouble bottle feeding it, he took the kitten and bottle from me and fed that little guy himself. He was done after that. Certified cat dad.
My dad adamantly insists he doesn't like cats and if my mom and sister get one it's banned from his room and he takes zero responsibility to care for it (as if they care, they both are obsessed with my cats, hence wanting their own). But it's all a bunch of bull, he once visited the cat shelter I worked at and sat in a room for hours reading with an old senior cat parked on his lap and he loved every second of it (even if he still insists he only went because I work there and he just wanted to see the place). Once my mom and sister find their perfect cat, I swear my dad is going to love that cat the most out of all of them 😂
Something about cats with those coats! https://i.imgur.com/1vI6uPX.jpg
My Dad hates cats. He hates them so much he's taught one of my Mothers cats to sit up and roll over, and it sleeps on his lap every night.

I never wanted a cat.  Then one day my wife was out walking our dog and found a kitten in a barn covered in oil under a tractor, almost dead and called me.  It was 4 weeks old and maybe half a pound.  It was thanksgiving day, and I rushed it to my lab at the hospital I worked at, 30 miles away, gave it IV saline, got it on heat and brought it home.  Long story short, there is a sixteen pound cat on our kitchen table dropping stuff on our pittbull’s head as we speak.
Someone grow me a beard asap.
Same with me and our dog. Said we were absolutely not keeping him, 2 years later I'd go John Wick for that little asshole.
These kind of titles just makes it look like a big decision like keeping a pet is not a joint decision. This is cute and all but heaven knows the times the pet's did not get accepted by the other partner and how the pets were treated.
She adores him! So cute
Kittens don't play fair.
How can people not fall in love with cats? I will never understand
Orlando Brewing!
Just look at that goofy, adoring smile. This kitten 100% owns him. And he loves it. ❤️
do the claws ever get caught in the beard?
He said ' i dont like cats, didnt he '
when the mind says no, but the ~~heart~~ beard says yes
The smile on his face says it all. That's your kitty now.
They are adorable together!
There’s no stronger bond than the one between a man and the cat he said he “didn’t want”
Adorable..
MY HEART IS MELTING OMG 😭😭😭😭😭
I don't usually comment, or watch videos longer than a few seconds. I'd much rather read an article. But I watched this start to finish. TWICE.
My heart just pooped it’s pants
You’ve fallen for it’s trap
He is a certified cat dad from now on.
My mom rescued a kitten from under a car at night in the pouring rain at a fast food restaurant. She pulled the kitten from the undercarriage and said "here you go, we're not keeping her". We already had two at home.

She kept talking about how we weren't keeping her and how she had to go for weeks. And my gruff longshoreman dad would sit there and pet her saying "but she had such cute little black paws. Look at her paws. And look at her tiny little ears.' 

We kept the cat til she died of old age around 16. We loved her a lot. My tightwad mom even sprang for surgery when she had a tumor in her eye and because a pirate kitty.  My family is really into cats, allergies never stopped us.
[deleted]
There should be a subreddit dedicated to dads who strongly oppose getting a pet but inevitably end up with a picture cuddling it and treating it like a child.
[deleted]
he tinny
This is truly the most precious thing I have ever seen. That kitten is a lucky feller.
Isn't that just how to compromise? He didn't want the kitten, so you kept it. 💕
The cat makes the rules. ☺️
No one can stand against the power of kittens. No one!
This was exactly the right video I needed right now, thank you.
Adorable. 

He’s kinda really hot.
You always, always, always keep the kitten. I can’t stress that enough. Unless it has tags and someone just lost it, of course
You guys are in Orlando? (Assuming from your username.) that’s awesome! So are we. Enjoy the kitty!
Your husbands face shows pure joy from that little kitten. I think it’s a win for all of you. ❤️
I used to have a cat that looked exactly like that.
Nope. Kitten‘s keeping you.
The best thing about beards is that they're free. They are God's gift to men (and kittens).
Miss Kitty clearly knew who she needed to win over.  Kitten the wise!
u/meowingatthemoon
Men like this never want to keep the pet because they know how attached they will get to it and are scared of the heart break when it is the pet’s time
Little weirdo loooooves the beardo!!
Cats are great negotiators
That’s his cat now. It will follow him everywhere like a dog and he will be the cat’s favorite snuggle partner. The same thing happened to my dad.
"There is no love like that between a dad and a dog he said he didn't want"

That's one funny lookin dog though
Everybody keeps the kitten
Kitten has selected her humans.  This can not be undone.
He doesn’t know what E-Y-E-S spells
I want to hug the both of them
Ladies and gentlemen looking at this post rn, get you a significant other who loves you like this cat loves that dudes beard.
love a sweet kitten
Animals know which one they gotta flaunt the cuteness on to score the forever home.
I swore we were only going to the shelter to have a look, and whatever we decided, we definitely weren't going ahead that day.

We got two that day.
Kitty is like "can't reach the yugular!"
My kitten also likes hair. He makes biscuits in my hair and the back of my neck. I have my own 80’s hairstylist, as it teases the hell out of my hair
Awwwww, my heart. 🥰
That toxoplasmosis kicks in quick, huh?
Can confirm.  Husband did the same thing with one of our cats.  That cat is now his "little girlie" and he treasures her.  It's so cute.
That’s pure joy right there folks!!!
I said the same thing. I now have two of em! Cats are the best!
I also own a cat I never asked for.  Those manipulative little fucks.
This is the same way I got my husband Larry to keep Sprinkles! 😍🥰
Look at all that looovveee. You win the cuteness award today sir.
Cats are so lovely.
awww wishing you guys many many many happy years with kitty
I love cats
Been there done that after several years I finally got a potential "barn" cat. I don't have a bond but I do have sheds. My husband is allergic but man he loves that little guy!!
What a magnifiscent beard, my good sir.
Beards make me behave the same way 😌
If you start snuggling his beard, he might decide to keep you too!
I love these “we aren’t keeping it” memes. The little furballs always find a way into our hearts.
My 10 month old child also plays with my beard like this, and I, too, decided to keep her.
Love at ~~first~~ fur sight!
I was once the boyfriend who said no. In the years since becoming a cat dad I've realized the cat has really lightened me up.
she is a vampire cat, trying to suck out his blood to make him her servant.
Who adopted who again? :)
Played like a fine tuned fiddle
Aww, better keep the phone handy. When they do this in the middle of the night and your husband wakes up screaming. You will wish you had that on video! One of our cats growing up bit my dad on his big toe in the middle of the night. He woke up screaming, I still laugh when I think about this!
Guys don't want to keep stray/adopted animals because we know we will, eventually, out live said animal.  

Society has taught us that we have to be the "rock" everyone else leans on, but no one pays attention to the cracks that form from all the pressure :'(
I admit, I'm a dog guy, but there's something about cats that just gets you sometimes. In the last year, I have had two of the coolest cats come into my life and I am so glad they're here
How can you say no to that little soft tiger
Yeah, my husband sait the same about our lovely pair :))
Not sure who loves who more. Cats are amazing.
Cats always know which human they have to convince.
My chest has perpetual small pricks in it from this kind of interaction. Worth it.
r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
I love democracy.
Kitten said "Hold my catnip"
This kitten reminds me of my childhood kitty
THAT. IS. CUTE.
Cats are born manipulators.
###Give a man a good excuse to be extra loving and affectionate, and feel comfortable showing his emotions, and you will see a very happy man.

*Meow.* 😁🐈
Cats are low maintenance and high reward
I’m convinced people who say no to getting more pets love them the most. They’re just also super sensitive to the needs of the pet, er, family member, and realize how much work is involved. Clearly love wins every time
First time ever seeing a cat that likes to be held.
When I finished the headline, I assumed my wife had written it.
Nothing is stronger than the love between a cat and a Dad who didn't want him.
Had this same thing happen. Wife brought in a kitten that her and my daughter had run up to them in the cul-de-sac. 

Now, keep in mind, my wife was never an animal lover and had never even had pets growing up--I was and we had three cats at the time already (my elderly cat and my mom's two cats because she was living with us).

Anyway, we're all talking about it at the dinner table and I'm like NO. Not another one. Wife, my mom, and both the kids are all giving me sad eyes. I'm like wtf folks. More food, more vet bills, etc. My daughter says, "okay, we don't have to keep her." I promptly threw her butt back outside (female kittah).

Fast forward about 30 seconds. She is at the back window by our dining room just looking straight at me. Then she taps the window. Bink-bink-bink. Bink-bink-bink. I mumble and start heading to the back door. Hear the kids and my mom laughing because this kitten already knows what's up. I couldn't even open the backdoor all the way before zooooommm. She's in.

Here I am almost nine years later with two cats. Her and one of my mom's that I inherited after she passed away (she is 21!).
That is the sweetest thing I have seen in a long time. You, your husband and the kitten are blessed.
I need this in my life
Is there a name for this specific kind of cat? We just got a rescue that looks almost identical (and is the most loving cat I've ever met).
Adorable indeed
I think that's his cat now
be careful the cat doesn't start trying to eat your hair, mine loves to do that and it hurts like hell lol
Yup. This baby looked your husband in the eyes and did that thing that all cats do. He's been owned.
the beard has a mind of its own
When I got my little sister a kitten, my mom was upset because she didn't like cats and didn't think I'd take her seriously when she agreed we could get one. Not even two days later she's babytalking to the kitten and giving her treats and pets.
r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
r/mensmittenwithkittens
Had a friend who was a dag person, didn't like cats. He visited our apartment after we got a cat, the cat hopped on his lap, kneaded for a bit and took a nap. My friend says "I understand the appeal now."
And without the grace to look ashamed!
It sure does love that beard
You dont choose the kitten the kitten chooses you!
Kittens... Emotionally manipulating you since the beginning of time. Lolz
Cuteness factor coming in!
Reminds me of peter griffin with the little birdies in his beard. Good stuff thanks for sharing
I SOOOO LOVE THIS!!  You didn't have a chance buddy!  Kitty claimed ya :-D LMAO
That kitten stole your man and it’s the most adorable thing ever 🥰
Plot twist the cat was choking him lol 😂
How could anyone say no to that.. Just to cute.
Kitten, probably: "What's that? A human that doesn't want me? We can't have that. I will make you adore me."
Cats know who to butter up to be able to stay in a home they like. They're smart like that
Cats always love non cat people the most it’s hilarious
You do realize he is gonna hurt twice as much as you do when you have to say goodbye to the cat. He will cry...
Fun fact. Cats love to play with beards. I think it's called Kneeding. It's the same thing tbey do with comforters and blankets.
Yeah! He is keeping the new kitten! Good luck getting a turn for a cuddle!
My wife, the vet, said that's about the most adorable freaking thing I've ever seen in my life
OMG! Same thing happened here and ours looks just like that!
Oh hey mural queen, Kristin! 💕
You wanted a cat, but the cat chose your husband. Now to find the treats they like and teach them tricks to steal that bond hahaha
there’s no greater love than that between a cat and the dad who claimed they couldn’t keep it.
Oh, boy! That kitten is now Dad's best friend! So cute! I love watching it. Thank you for posting.
Cats are just the neatest and cutest little creatures, despite being badass af hunters. Also, their fur smells so lovely 🥰
This is such a stupid fucking saying. It just astounds me to no end how acceptable it is for one half of the couple to say “no” when asked about getting a pet, and later when the pet is gotten anyways they have to be near it and take care of it. It’s so selfish.

Edit: hello controversial
Exact same thing happened with our first cat. Wife brings home a stray kitten, I lost my shit. I held said kitten, it snuggled into my beard and fell asleep. That’s my dude.
Is your husband the E-Y-E-S guy??
Men and their cats! My husband prefers princess cats and he’s basically a farmer. We invited Lucy into our home less than 2 years ago and she’s our youngest daughter. This really pisses my 19 year old daughter off. Lucy is a Siamese. She’s the sweetest feline I think I’ve ever owned. She most def rules my house and rules her fathers heart. I’m just here cook clean and we’ll take care of her until dad Arrives then she glares at me from his lap. Little bitch
Your husband is basically my twin.  You both have impeccable taste.
If it makes you feel any better, my Tasshole (Tasselhoff Burrfoot) acted the same way, curling up into necks and wanting his face curled up against you. 

He still does it, two years later ;)
Kitten says “no! I stay here. On top of chest. Under beard. No, on top of beard. No, under beard, no, in hand (lick lick) in hand, no, I play with beard. No, under beard.  No, on top of heart! I stay here”
Minor rant:

I realize this type of post is done in good faith and humor. I'm happy that you and your husband are happy, honestly, truly, 100%.

The trend of this type of post forgets the fact that there is a fundamental diff between:

1) Enjoying the animal/person/object as an independent entity.

Vs

2) Enjoying the responsibility, time commitment, cost, work, etc. involved in the ream of making sure it it cared for, maintained, and giving into the pressure of a significant other, child, etc.

My wife and I have a Rottweiler. She's a wonderful dog: insanely tolerant of my 2 year old (outside of understanding her size), good around other dogs and strangers, very protective of all of us, gentle, etc. Couldn't ask for more from a dog. End of story. 

However, that absolutely doesn't mean that I enjoy:

- Having to plan and spend on boarding whenever we head out of town and bringing the dog with us isn't an option. 

- Paying for dog-walkers M-F because we can't be home to do it ourselves. 

- A small child worth of medical expenses for general check ups, tick/flea prevention, ear infections because she thinks that the garden hose is the most amazing game ever, etc. 

- Cost of food, toys, etc. 

- Picking up a copious amount of dog goo from the back yard. 

The list of responsibilities required are endless.

What I'm essentially saying is that perhaps someone who is talked into, pressured, and relents into having a pet/child may very much care for the pet/child itself, but may not appreciate and potentially resent their giving into your potentially wearing them down or surprising them. 

Note: I grew up in a house of dogs/cats (Great Dane, weimaraner, aussie cattle dog, rottie-beagle mix, 2 cats, frogs, fish, an iguana, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something or another). I understood the drawbacks and relented. I love the animal, do everything possible to make her happy/loved, but I absolutely wish we hadn't undertaken the responsibility of ownership.
r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
That's gonna be my fiance when I bring home a cat
Woooo! Because his opinion doesn’t matter as long as you get your pet!
Husband was kind enough to even grow a new best friend for the kitten on his chin.
Looks like the kitten chose you. Nothing you can do about it!
Kitties always know how to wheedle their way into the hearts of the hoomans who didn't want them....
Good thing he said it; kitteh knew immediately who to tame.
Aw. Look how happy they both are.
It only takes that "one" cat and then you're hooked for life.
Cat is confused by amout of beard :D
Your husband’s joy is contagious and radiating, OP! I am smiling because he is smiling!! 🤗
Thats how it always starts, “There is no way we are keeping the kitten”.
Adorable,  This is written to both of you- in case u don’t know. These little ones at this age go crazy. Like children in the terrible 2’s & 3’s.
They-
Climb your jeans- with you in those jeans - to get up to your face. Just coz your standing or sitting - it’s a short cut.

Tackle your legs while walking not realizing their nails are clawing u.  Bite not realizing - that hurts you!

It ends! After this baby period!!!

Bare through it!   She will grow up and grow out of it. Be gentle when reprimanding her. Don’t break that sweet spirit!
My wife was interviewing for a job when at lady came in to show the interviewer kitten photos that she's hoping to get rid of before leaving the country.  

Me: Okay, but, we get ONE cat.  I am not getting two cats.  Tell me you understand this

Her: I understand that

Me: I'm serious, our house isn't big enough for 2 cats.  Two cats are just twice the bills

Her: I understand.  I promise, 1 cat.

So now We have two cats.
I've said that three times to my wife over the last 20 years. I have ended up with three kittens.
When I was young and wanted to keep a stray cat, My mom would automatically say no. But if we got her to hold the cat, it was ours. Worked every time. 😀
You can see him realise the kitty isn't going anywhere & has chosen him 😍
The only people that say they "are not cat people" have just never had a kitten before.
People who love animals are all right with me.
My girl had a 9(now almost 11) year old cat when we got together. I think part of the reason she keeps me around is that old lady cat loves my beard so much it's crazy.
Should be posted on cute guys with cats. Your husband is wonderful with kitty
They're both beautiful. Congrats.
Cats have a sixth sense for knowing when they’re unwanted. Why else would they always aim for people with allergies?
"This beard is an enchanted fae bramble, in which I shall build my kingdom and rule the length and breadth of it's domain."

\-that kitten, probably
I wish I had a beard kitty.
That’s adorable. Thank you for sharing.
Oh, honey.... the kitten kept you!
Well, u see..  It was not up to him.. The kitten found her human so the circle is complete and he feel in love with the kitten right!
The relationship between guys who didn't want the pet and the pet almost always ends up being so wholesome
Kitten decided to keep him.
daddy’s girl now i see. lol
Aww!! So sweet!! Wishing you all a long happy life together!!
Your husband’s beard is glorious
Yup. Two cats later. Kittens are kryptonite to even the hardest of men.  I am one of those men.  I also talk to them in little baby voices and nicknames.  No shame here in aww...
Love me a tabby!
This is beyond amazing
As a dad who didn't want kittens I have to say, everybody loves kittens. I'm I speak for a fair amount of guys when I say that It's not like I'm some fucking lunatic that doesn't think kittens are cute, nice to pet, and entertaining. It's the added responsibility that comes with the kitten that I didn't want and still (as the owner of 2 kittens) don't want. Cleaning the litter box, making sure they don't get killed in front of my family, vet bills, and so on. It's just more work and soon they will be big cats that will receive less attention from the kids and whose going to left taking care of them? Good ol dad with his infinitely expanding workload. So don't take a picture of the kitten cuddling on my lap and think that you're so clever and knew I would like a kitten. I made a personal sacrifice to try and make you happy and I am trying to make the best of it.
I mean, just because men don't want another pet doesn't mean we are going to neglect the animal if ours is the minority position.
Kitties take a "we're not keeping the cat!" statement as a challenge! 

My dad said it when I bought a kitten home. Then within a few days, kitty would curl up next to him, whenever he sat down... He fell in love so hard! ❤️
The kitten knew exactly who needed the convincing
Omg my sister just came home with a kittens fn my mom isnt allowing her idk what to do
I think that kitten found her chosen human. 😊
My Princess Umbra loves to be held like this so she can rub her face against my beard. It's our morning ritual at my desk
And I see baby loves the Daddy. Someone said online that there is nothing on earth like the love between a man and The Cat He Didn't Want. 

Baby reminds me of our little Qi, who is also a tabby. Hubby (who used to claim he didn't like cats either) is very taken with Qi and has declared that she's one of his favourites of the cats we've had. I heard him SINGING to her the other day.
Points for the unamused orange cat in the background.
I can see he's barely tolerating it
Oh snap reppin OBC
Props for the OB shirt!
Cat chose the owner. Not the other way around. That how it should be. I chose my cat and I can't never get my cat to show affection.
r/toughguysholdingpets
good man, glad you came around
Does anyone know the breed of these kinds of cats? I have two of these raccoon tailed stripy babies, both found in the wild as little kittens, and they're just the best. They have polar opposite personalities but are both very loyal.
Da fuq you know.
Is your husband Braun Strowman ?!
Kittens love beards. That makes me happy😊
Same. Dalai is now 6 years old. Source, am cat dad.
Glad you were able to compromise

Wow I love this! Some of the purest live you can ever experience comes from animals. ❤️ She's such a cutie, good choice keeping her! 😊
That smile, the giggles, that play, the pets, the constant looks in the eyes.. yeah who are you trying to fool? You were keeping the kitten the second you both made eye contact. Sorry Mrs, but looks like the kitten is stealing your best friend!

The kitten loves him. This is so cute.
Once a kitten is in your home they’re impossible to get rid of.
aww the kitty loves him
of course you did :]
Orlando Brewing! Miss that place!
She looks exactly like my cat
Are you by any chance in Washington? Our kitten looks 100% identical to that!!
This melted my frozen heart a little bit. Not even the manly of men can resist the powers of a cuddly kitten. Looks like they're a match made in heaven. Here's to many many years of play and cuddles.
The look of ultimate happiness
KITTEH LUV BEARD
a lot of people think they don't like cats... until they meet one that loves them and then they realize how awesome cats can be.
That is literally the exact replica of my kitten :O
So adorable!! 😍😍😍
hahhahhaha
Ah yes, compromise
Animals can tell who the skeptic is. They know who they gotta win over to keep getting food and cuddles.
I love how the kitten grooms him and stays for cuddles. Its already treating him like his fellow clan mate.

It's her little blanket! (I, for once have thought of something really cursed, so I'm sorry. Cursed and maybe cringe warning).......................... I'LL MAKE A NEST OUT YOUR BEARD. TIMMY!!
The exact same thing happened to me and now I love our cat.
You'll get that.

I need to barrow a puppy or a kitten to convince my mom to get one cuz she is terrified of them
cats rule the world
I never wanted a cat.  But back in college I asked my gf if I could go to Vegas with some friends.  She said OK, but only if she could get a cat to keep her company while I was gone.  I said OK, and we went to a friend of hers whose cat recently had kittens.  

When we got there I just sat on the couch while she played with the kittens and tried to pick one out.  At some point, the littlest one wandered over near the couch.  She clawed her way up the front of the couch, and curled up against my leg.  

And that's how I got my first cat. :)
The only situation in relationships when no actually does mean yes
mama!
My hearts melting that’s the cutest thing ever! The kitten probably thinks his beard is it’s Momma lol❤️
Awww lil kitty is so sweet! Glad you all kept it
And that's how we ended up with 3 kitties
A mackerel tabby!  She looks just like my Dallas whom I had back in the 90's!  Aww!
You're fucked!   . . . In the best way possible! This is adorable.
He never stood a chance
Bizarrely he reminds me of the guy in the car who couldn't say what E.y.e.s spelled?

AHHHHH!!!! 😍😍😍😍😍
Yeah I said the same thing about our second dog. Now we’re looking into getting a third.
He looks like “E-Y-E-S” guy.
Why does it seem like the only cute pictures of boyfriends/husbands/fathers with pets that I see these days include a note that they were opposed to getting the adorable puppy or kitten?
The kitten loves him! They are going to be good friends in the future. ❤️

His face says it all! Like “actually I think I really love this kitten”
There is nothing better than seeing a man with a kitten. Except, maybe more kittens.
They always keep the kitten
Currently also foster failing with my whole bunch lmao
Currently also foster failing with my whole bunch lmao
"You're  fuzzy too!"
Be careful not to lose the kitten in his beard.
Our kitties are twins!
Dad: No, we cant have a kitten, i dont like cats   
Dad and the kitten:
Oxytocin.
wow youre husband has such a great beard
Furry things like Furry things

Makes sense
Orlando represent! (Orlando Brewing shirt)
Cats seem to know who they have to win over
Sorry if this is too personal but do you live in Indiana, because that cat looks like one my family and I just finished fostering
It's Cute! I love kitten.
there is no love in the world like between a pet and the dad who didnt want to keep it
is this the same guy with the yes and eyes on /r/ContagiousLaughter ?
Ah these kittens really know how to adopt a human
You mean the kitten has decided to adopt your husband.  Funny how these little guys can wield so much power by pulling on a beard (heart strings).
Was it's name Teigen originally? Because it looks very similar to a cat I met at an adoption center recently with that name
There is no way to reject someone this adorable 😍
r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
Little monster knew the husband had to be charmed. Good job kitten!
Cats make a great first pet. They love to cuddle, are super cute and take care of themselves.
Hey neighbor! I have the same shirt in the same color :)
I just saw this video in post titled *My wife said "there is no possible way we are keeping the beard." So we kept the beard.*
Now he understands that you ALWAYS keep the kitten, right?
A noble compromise!
That cat is thoroughly attached to this man. Lol he's fucked for the next 15-20yrs.
We don't choose cats. They choose us
He’s earning his keep.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Orlando Brewing is best brew company ❤
Flat out made me melt
Same
How much for an hour of this footage?
We have two dogs and two cats. I never told my family that I didn't want pets. Just that I'm not going to be picking up poop or cleaning litter boxes. I love dogs and cats. Just not enough to pick up their poop for the rest of their lives.  If they want pets that's great but don't expect me to pick up on their daily care after you get bored of doing it after two weeks.
Now I want a husband... and a kitten.
That’s one smittten kitten ❤️
Dang. What a sore loser. NYET!
Tabby master breed
The kitten kept you. We tell ourselves different but they know.
Our newest kitten got us with the same tactic. Foster failed
I wonder if the cat smells beard oil or shampoo or something in his beard.
My heart has melted and merged with the organs below it. So lovely and cute. Aww indeed.
Hes so cute!
I'm doubly jealous of this man. I want a beard and a cat like that.
That's how I have 2 cats... i actually prefer cats to dogs now.
More like the kitten has new slaves now.
Kittens love beards
Animals really know who to go for and win the heart, my dog was the same way, my dad didn’t want us to get a dog and finally gave in. We went looking to adopt and we found her. We met in a room and she immediately went to him. You can see the love he has for her it’s been a good 13 years
not many things make my heart melt, this made mine melt like it was ice in hell
Wait for that kitty to get in chill sleepy cuddle mode and trim them nails. That way you can avoid some scratches when that adorable boi/gurl gets frisky. Those talons look formidable right now.
Awwww that baby loves him!
I have the exact same cat with the exact same behaviors
that's your new husband then?
Omg daddy is loving that baby kitten so much. Adorable.
This takes my heart away
The kitten chose you. 
I love how cats gravitate towards the one who doesn’t like them
Aw cute! My cat looks exactly like that!
Does this breed&coat have a name? Thanks!
Too cute
This kitten chose your husband
Further illustrating how we hate the things we've never felt love from.
Little floof meets big floof
Does any man actually stick to the "I don't want that cat/dog"?
That kitten is one of the most adorable things I have ever seen, I'm so jealous of you guys!
It’s William Osman.
This is the sweetest thing I’ve seen all day and I needed it. Thank you!!
Aww
Cats are the devil. Especially the two that have cuddled with me at night for the past ten years.
Obviously you are not giving this man's beard enough attention!! But Kitty knows!!
What kind of cat?
Poor husband never had a chance haha
Man never stood a chance lmao. Kittens rule
He really adores this kitten!
You will never see his chin again. There must always be a beard for kitten.
Now that is adorable.
What most non-cat people say ive learned lol
What a lucky man he is! Is the kitty named Beardy, Lucky, Impossible or NoWayJosé?😻
He might leave you for the kitten. Be careful what you want.
Love how the kitten liked and wet his finger to rub it on its own head xD
It's almost impossible to resist kitten.
Aww, he looks like my little Ranma with his fancy eye makeup!
He’s smitten!
Watch out. These invasive species drove out the natural fauna we had in our household. I had an old lab, then we got a kitten. The lab eventually died and now we have 7 cats.
SO CUTE!!!
Aww looks just like my cat! 😍
she such a happy kitty
He looks like my boy Thor who recently passed. I hope that kitten brings you endless joy.
Dwah
With a good woman beside him, man has always been able to do the impossible
Is this the "ee-yes!" guy?
Wow thats crazy we have his twin, like we thought someone had actually taken our cat 😂
"We" didn't get a kitten, he got a kitten.
Sweet little cat pooh...
I love animals, but the idea of supporting more always makes me want to say no.
well yah himb bebby
Well that settles it, you can't go clean shaven anymore.
Husbands are weird animals
Correction, the kitten kept you...!
That beard is 🔥
He doesn't even need a beard comb anymore!
That kitty's going to have the best barber shop!!! hee hee "Give treats and scritches, we groom you good..." LOL
I love everything about this!
That kitten is soooo cute
kitties are great. cats are cool too.
As someone who fears great loss - I understand why a person would resist getting a pet.
Of course you are keeping a kitten who loves the epic beard.
I think he wants the beard shaved. 😻Who’s the cats’ Daddy?
my cat is an identical twin to this one I cant even believe its not my cat. mine sets up shop on my shoulder though
He didn't say anything about the kitten keepin the hoomins tho
Yup, that’ll do it
Smart kitten!
The love on his face is palpable!
Kittie needs a pal! Think if it like this, if you ever leave for a 10-hour day, it’s much nicer to snuggle with a friend as opposed to being sad and lonely...😿
Your kitten's adorableness game is strong!
I’m absolutely terrified of cats but this is this cutest thing ever.
I grew up in a row house in 1960's NY Queens when this one Christmastime a stray Tom, soon later came-to-be-known as Whiskers... was cuddling the lighted plastic baby Jesus in the straw of our plywood Manger scene and my father said, 

*"If there he stays then that's alright"*

but as days passed it got colder so I put him the basket of my banana seat bike, with one of those sissy bar things, and rode him around the block, spinning my pedals furiously with him upright upfront looking about, to the alley out back to show him where which was our house so he could sleep on a blanket in wood milk crate in the back of the garage with the door slightly up under the workbench on the shelf, and my father said, 

*"That's ok but no further than that"*

but after a week it got really really cold and someone decided snekking him in, to the downstairs was a good idea and I remember my father putting down his foot  

*"This is the last straw, that cat will never pass the basement door"*

yet 2 hours later while passing thru, there was the cat asleep in my lap, us in the living room.

and shook his head as he walked away

*without saying as much as a word*

Later that night I climbed out my bed when on the way to the bathroom for a sip, I peeked down the stairs and there was my father in front of the late night news, in his favorite chair,  his head back - him snoring, and  

curled at his side slept a kitty who could no further than that

Outside cat wanna come in, inside cat gotta be out and there's nothing you're gonna do about that
beautiful stripeeey !
He's a good man❤😂🤣
Nah, that kitten kept him.
Cat:   "There is NO possible way you are ever shaving or trimming that beard"
Dude, he or she will be your best friend!!
look at the kitties
Its the cats beard now
Awwwww hes a softy.
That is just so sweet.
What cat breed?
That cat looks like mine who is 9 years older, very cute!
D’awwww, that sweetie looks just like one of my babies!
“I wanted a kitten, my husband didn’t, so we compromised and got a kitten!”
Wait, it’s just like the dad and dog memes


Always has been
What a loving kitten!
Hubby will always have a groomed beard from now on! 🤣
Random question. Do all female tabbies look like this, or is it just a common thing? Because this kitten is the spitting image of my tabby. Like, if I didn't know any better, I'd think you'd kidnapped her or something.
r/mensmittenwithkittens
Dude, cats are Gs
Can I just point out that not wanting a cat but loving it once you have it aren't necessarily contradictory. I probably wouldn't want another cat. I love cats more than anything and I'd love and cherish any cat I ended up with. But I wouldn't want one because of the constant worry when it doesn't come home for a few days, when you hear strange sounds outside at night, when it gets sick and has to go to the vet...and my mental health likely wouldn't survive another lost pet.
You have to keep the kitten. Husband needs a new beard cleaner.
Haha The kitten loves the beard!  Man I wish I had a Cat still
He is now owned!
r/cuteguyswithcats
I count 3 that started that way. I fostered a cat, it was for 30days. The person was Hispanic and somehow she thought I said, I will keep her. I actually said I would keep her until they found her a home. The sig other keeps asking "when is the cat leaving? "When are they finding her a home?" Soooo after 7 months I said you dummy, they did! He said really? I said yes, he said when is she going to her forever home? I said she is home! I am not allowed to foster anymore...🙄
...and you gave up the husband? Seems like a fair trade. Kittens have their ways....
Wow that looks like my cat
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Awwww... your husband is a sweetheart and ya'll's new kitten is adorable!! ❤❤
This is like one of those “dad and dog” memes
Buddies right there.
My dad said the same thing about our dog....who lived to a ripe old age of 18.  yep, we kept the dog.  and one of my siblings said, when she passed it was the only time my dad had tears in his eyes.  RIP sweet Tammy.
OP make him shave it off randomly and film cats reaction plsss
I have a kitten that we recently adopted from a person that behaves and looks exactly like that! Hmmmmm...
Frickin adorable!
I thought this was my friends husband and was very confused because they already have three cats, so thought “what difference does a fourth make?”
“He has one cat on his face, why not two?”
Kitteh likes the beard
Dad: I told you I didn’t want any cats!

Dad and the cat:
I told my wife no kittens.  Ended up with two kittens...
He is mommy now
Awww this is so cute ❤️
Look, it’s [every male redditor]!
LOL happens EVERY time! HOW can u resist a kitten?? You can’t. That’s it. He’s done. Nice plan. 🤣
It’s so cute when husbands think they are in charge. 😀
As a big scary bearded guy it’s hard for things to like us off first look. Pets always seem to be the exception.
Ah the way he looks at the kitten
How could one not fall in love with that
 What does his T-shirt say?
How could you not keep that kitten.
It's all fun and games until she goes for the jugular.
I will never be more relaxed than when I have a kitten sniffing my face in that curious little way they do. Those are the moments I am at peace.
This kitten looks EXACTLY like mine!
Isn‘t that the guy from the 'spell "E-Y-E-S"'-video?
Love wins out. 🐱💟
Sounds like a toxic relationship
The trouble with a kitten is that  
It becomes a cat.
the people who are against keeping the pets are the first ones who fall for them 😂❤️
Omg, the husband is WheezyWaiter's clone!
Awwwe cutie!!
My god. This is precious
The best!
That’s how they get ya!
it just looks like it’s tryna hide in his beard 🥺
This is the origin story of KittenBeard, the greatest pirate duo on the high seas
He'll rethink that when she uses his beard as a curtain to climb up to the top of his head and use his scalp as a scratching post. Maybe accidentally hooking an eyeball on the way up. He'll get over it though.
This is TOO FREAKING CUTE
That is so sweet!
Amazing
“You’re wiry and snuggly mom...”
I have a male cat just like this one! His name is Zazzles! They are great cuddle bugs!💙
My eyeballs!! That's too cute!
How many more animals does that guy have hidden in his beard?
My one cat loved my husbands beard. Tried to groom him and nuzzled it so much.
tsun tsun :3
Both of them are so happy! I love it. 💛
Cats know who they need to impress, I swear.
Kitten LOVES him!!!
Sorry, it looks like kitty stole yo man!!! 😻
He looks exactly like a man who will not keep the kitten.  


\[/irony off\] 

You can already see a bond forming between those two. And he is full of joy. Thank you for sharing.
Looks very similar to my cat. An adorable rambunctious bengal
I feel like animals know who says this and purposefully loves them until they change their mind.
I will never grow tired of the "man adamantly refuses to accept a pet, and then falls hopelessly in love with said pet," genre.
I can keep watching this video again and again! It’s just adorable!
Such a sweetheart!
It's a she? Oh y'all screwed now lol
Aww
A tale as old as time
😂😂😍😍😍
He loves the cat more than the wife
That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
This just melted my heart. Thank you so much for posting this! ❤️
Hey OP, has the kitten started grooming your husband’s glorious beard yet? 🤣
Your hubby looks like a really nice man and such a big guy so gentle with a baby cat. I like him. Glad you kept her too btw. This world needs more herders.
I said that about the three black dogs, 20 years ago. We kept all three. At my urging.
Big man discover feelings lol
That’s the cutest thing!!!  The kitten loves you !!!
As a man in this same boat not one but three times n the same result the little fuckers our faces become the perr n cold nose pad lol
Men who like cats are super sexy.
well the kitten is playing with your beard, and seems to enjoy it 😁
Cute 😍
Us hubbies really have no say
He looks just like my baby & he is the absolute light of my life. No matter how shitty I feel he's always there for me.
That kitten looks literally exactly like the kitten we found and decided to keep a few weeks ago
They find the weak ones and convert them
And now you can’t shave
I’m convinced that anyone who says that they hate cats just haven’t had a cat.
🤣 My husband said this too when we found three kittens. We adopted one out, then he said we were keeping the other two. They have him wrapped around their paws.
Serious question: why is this a thing? Like do guys who say this just have little experience with kittens and this is the first time they've gotten to know one? I guess my assumption is that guys have had dogs or didnt have pets and dont know why they would be good then meet them and see the evidence and change their minds but idk
Resistance is futile.
She’s gorgeous and so cuddly!
It's like cats instinctively know who they have to win over with their cuteness to maintain their place in the household.
r/IllegallySmolCats
That little cutie patootie had DaddyKat wrapped within in her paws on day one.🤗
To be fair I'm the same way with beards.
Kitten: "One second while I make him my b\*tch"
That's her hooman now. You don't exist anymore. Well maybe at feeding time. For 5 minutes.
Awwww 😍
They know our weakness.... they will take over the world ... unless theres an empty box.   Congrats on new kitten...
[deleted]
Aww that's the best thing I've seen all day
This is incredibly sweet. Reminds me of my kitty. Thanks for sharing. :)
Your husband has a glorious beard.
Such a cutie! What’s his/her name?
I love the way kitty keeps nuzzling the beard, it's great, both r gorgeous
A beard so epic it has its own pet
Look at the state of this beard. C'mere Imma fixes it.
Cats do have a way
We have a cat my husband absolutely said we could not keep 7 years ago. 😻He sleeps curled up to him every single night.
I’m so happy you didn’t keep the kitten!!!
Keep an eye on that kitten with the parrot in the other room ! Our mini Macaw has had to bite each of our cats at least once so they know to leave him alone.

Pounce !
SQUAWK ! CHOMP !
Meoaaaaaawwwww ! (Cat runs and hides)
Parrot laughs ....
[deleted]
That kitty’s got mad game.
Cats don’t love you all the time but when they do it’s because they wanted to
Animals love beards
I love that about half way through your hubby's demeanor went from :| to :) .
Oh my goodness, I'm fostering a feral kitty that looks JUST like this baby! She's just suuuper shy and scared right now. I live in Orlando as well :) What a cutie!
I think she thinks his beard is her mother.
I mean that's a nice beard bro
Now she needs a kitten friend 🐱
They always know who to butter up 😊. We were at an adoption event and my husband was all "idk about a cat, maybe a small dog". We walked around and looked at everybody and I asked if there was anybody he wanted to look at again, and he mentions this one cat. We go, pull him out of the cage, and he immediately starts purring and puts one paw on my husband's cheek.

He freaking loves this cat so much, lol.
He has no choice in it, the kitten chose him.
Ooooo, that kitty loves their new papa something fierce. What a sweet pair! 😍 

I think the folks over in r/mensmittenwithkittens
and r/dadswhodidnotwantpets would appreciate this.
Aww the kitty adores him! I love this!
We convinced my dad to take home a stray that was found at his office "just for the weekend."  He was a part of our family for fifteen years.  

I swear the cat knew that first weekend that he had to be "super cute" and ingratiate himself to my parents.
The way I see it, the people who say they don’t want a cat just haven’t met the right cat.
I did exactly the same way back when I was younger. The cat then proceeded to ignore my existence for the next 12 years. Damn I miss that cat
Your husband and i have the same beard, the same mentality, and the same cat.

I'll update with picture after work.
lol it’s always the anti ones who are a magnet for the cats 😂
Everyone’s a dog person until they meet a cat that isn’t an asshole (which is most of them)
Don’t be surprised to wake up thinking your having a heart attack cause your chest feels heavy.  

My 20 yr old liked to crawl up on hubs for beard time. At 6 am. Cat was 20lbs. He had bad tuna breath. He died 7 years ago and hubs still misses it all.
I wish my smitten was that playful! My smitten is broken🙄
About 4 or 5 years ago, my mom found a husky running in the streets. She and my sis were able to catch her and brought her home “for the night” to take her to the shelter the next morning. That night, my dad said very sternly, “You know we’re not keeping her right?” I’m pretty sure I remember responding with something like, “Okaaay. Suuuuure.” Spoiler alert: we kept her. She now lives with my sister upstate and my parents and I adopted another one from a nearby shelter!
Hope you don't mind my saying so, but your husband is cuter than the kitten!
Wait til it throws up in the kitchen and he steps in it...
Our kitten looks exactly like that! Is there a name for that coloration?
I love how the kitten hides his head under hubby's beard! 😂🤣😅
What breed is that cat, I don't know what its called but I like it
r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
Hilariously creative post title, that most certainly has never been used before!
[deleted]
You could just say you bought a kitten. 

The whole “such and such never wanted animal but we got animal” titles are so damn fake.
Damn, what a shitty selfish wife.
The little smile on dad's face... UGH.
Congratulations!
Beautiful!❤️
The cat chose him 🥰. My wife and I rescued a cat with the help of a local rescue that just clings to me like that too. We initially intended only to foster him, but he was just attached to me like that too. Although my beard isn't that impressive, he likes to be in my beard too lol. We decided to name him Nico 👍.
He’s furry just like me. Mommy?
Try and get a second one \^\^ Alone, it can get lonely when you are both out and you'll get to witness some  wild shenanigans ahah
[deleted]
Why would a wife ever listen to her husband? That’s not how partnerships work.
Next time listen to him. He didn't want the responsibility, and probably didn't want the loss a decade or so later. My cat's loss hit me hard. I will never have another pet, I've lost enough in my life. His love for the cat is not proof he wanted it. When someone says they don't want a pet, don't give them a pet.
Ew how does his wife even kiss him, poor thing
So yours would be the only house where the husband has any say in anything?
Word to the wise, do not let cutesy internet nonsense fool you into thinking it's fine to completely disregard your partner's wishes, especially for something as huge as getting a pet. For every "changed their mind" post, there's probably 10 broken relationships or neglected pets. If you're gonna be a bit of dick and force your way, at least talk them into it across several months.
Posts like this make me terrified that one day my SO is going to bring home a pet despite me not being interested in one because people post stuff like this all the time.
Serotonin is a hell of a drug
Anyone else think the kitten is just looking for a nipple up there?
Dont eat the cat
Did you know that beards contain fecal bacteria? So everytime you kiss your husband, fecal bacteria is all over your face. And it's probably all over that cat's face too.
He will tell you that next time too. Don't believe him though - You already know what the outcome will be.
I would divorce your ass for bringing a cat into the house without both people agreeing.
Ah the good ol marriage.

Wife: babe can i...

Husband: yes

Wife: I was telling you. Not asking permission

‐---‐---------

Husband: damn why do I always have to take out the trash????

Wife: because you're a mamas boy with a little dick
Gross lol
You guys look like racist virgins
