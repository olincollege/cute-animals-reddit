Harry Potter modern day AU
In Chinese, owl is Áå´Â§¥Èπ∞ (maotouying) which literally translates to cat-head hawk.
Great... now i want an owl
do the owls have large talons?
As someone who works in wildlife rehab, owls make horrendous pets. A. They require a very specific diet, you can't just buy stuff from the grocery store. B. They often get aggressive in a few years and will start attacking their owner because they see that person as a mate due to imprinting as a chick. C. These animals are often poached from the wild as chicks or eggs, causing species to become closer to extinction and causing ecosystems to become out of whack. 

These animals then end up at wildlife rehab centers (if they don't die because of malnutrition or are not brought to a vet because they are illegal). They can never be released. 

If you want to be up close and personal with wildlife, work or volunteer at a rehab clinic or a zoo.

It's Harry Potter and the owl he finally got to replace Hedwig...
Owl is just trying to get the mouse.
I already posted this link to another user but I think it's important that as many as possible understand why owls are TERRIBLE pets! Imo they shouldn't even be kept as pets, at all. Unless maybe if you're an experienced falconer and have A LOT of money and time.

Harry Potter and the Strigiform of Procrastination
Inquisitive isn't he
I've never seen an owl IRL and I'm not happy about it.
Don‚Äôt ask me why I‚Äôm asking this question. 

What does owl shit smell like and do owls stink?
Wild animals don‚Äôt belong in a house though... I‚Äôm guessing that owl cannot be released into the wild for some reason...

Isn't it Harry and Hedwig?
Hummingbirds are the sharks of the sky.
It‚Äôs a laptop Hedwig. There‚Äôs no mouse. Stop looking.
As a barn owl owner, they are exactly cats of the sky, also just as annoying too. Mine does my absolute head in but i love him üíï they love knocking things off tables/shelf/wall

I believe there‚Äôs a Chinese word for owl that‚Äôs translated to eagle faced cat or something along those lines
I used to look after an owl who didn't like flying outside. She was called Bottom and was a very sweet long eared owl. Owls are the best

HARRY POTTER?!!
Now I want an houil
Here‚Äôs my owl story:

It was around 3am and I was driving down a regular two lane road that was basically just me and the asphalt. Before me in the road, just sitting there, was an owl. Not a large one, mind you. There wasn‚Äôt much I could do doing nearly 40mph but straddle it and hope I just went over it. 

As I drove over it I heard the ‚Äúkerchunk‚Äù of my vehicles undercarriage making impact with, what I assumed, was the owl‚Äôs skull. Feeling terrible, I turned around to check on it. As I returned I saw the owl there... perfectly fine. In the same position.  Staring at me with those owl eyes of his. Ghost owl.
Is that title a reference to humming birds are the sharks of the sky?
Does Hedwig know Harry is flaunting around town with another owl?!
Awesome owl  didnt know they can be house pets
I think this is a tawny owl. In Swedish the name is Kattuggla. Which if you would translate that literally, it would be Cat Owl.
is there a "pet the damn owl" subreddit?
And humming birds are the sharks of the sky
Are we not gonna talk about the fact that this man is wearing round glasses and has an owl? r/HarryPotter
Bats are the sky puppies. Owls are the sky kitties

Saw my first ever wild owl this week!! I‚Äôm in Scotland AMAZING
TIL owls are cool as shit. They can also be scary as fuck if you look at certain ones without knowing you‚Äôre looking at an owl. First couple frames of this gif had me like ‚Äúwhat the duck is that!?!?‚Äù Disclosure: Vodka may have had something to do with my initial reaction.
This owl looks like that piece of shit from the desert library.

You know what they call owls? Chicken of the night

Owls are the birds of the air
I did falconry in Scotland at a castle a couple years ago and got to hang out with an owl named Duke.

He's called that cause he walks like a cowboy.

At one point he stood sideways and puffed out a little to look bigger, a lot like a cat does.

You really gotta be a weird fuck to own an owl
I'm happy to see Harry Potter is doing well and got himself a new owl. RIP Hedwig.
I mean, they're definitely not birds, so...
I thought that was a large hedge hog at first glance!
Harry Potter but twinkier.
Owls. Not just for delivering magic letters any more.
Real life Harry Potter over here
Man, the Harry Potter movies missed a golden opportunity for some lighthearted owl scenes!
I imagine this is what Harry Potter would've had to deal with if COVID had forced Hogwarts to go remote.
Did this guy think "hey, I kinda look like Harry Potter, I should get an owl to avoid any confusion"?
Hi. I'm hoping you can help me. I need some keys reattached to my Macbook Pro that were pulled off by an owl.

I'm sorry, it sounded like you said "pulled off by an owl.".

Yep, that's what happened.

Huh. That's a new one. Bring it on in.
I would now like a pet owl.
PET HIM GODDAMNIT
The real reason why cats and dogs are the most popular house pets isn't loyalty or cuteness

It's about piss and shit.  There are a lot of super cute "exotic" pets out there.  But the deal breaker is that they piss and shit where ever they feel like pissing and shitting.
You‚Äôve heard how pets and their owners look alike?
I'm so confused, why are people always chilling with owls, east coast I never ever see them and on reddit everyone has one. Am I missing some crazy new trend

Wait wait wait. What do you have to do to have an owl. Like - is it legal and why don‚Äôt I have one right now.
I completely agree with this analogy
Owls are spooky creature particularly when you run into them at night next to a cemetery.
In Chinese, owls are literally called ‚Äúeagle with a cat head‚Äù, Áå´Â§¥Èπ∞.
My life just changed after reading the title of this post.
I‚Äôm getting goosebumps because of how big its head is.
God I would love an owl when I get my own place but I bet they‚Äôre incredibly expensive to buy and to raise and keep
Where do i get a docile owl from? I had an incredibly angry barn owl (i kmow its not legal to keep them in some countries, but its legal where i live)
I feel like JK Rowling knew this
Funny, our cat is our substitute pet owl, she is light, small and fluffy and kinda looks like one.

Hummingbirds are the sharks of the sky

Hummingbirds are the sharks of the sky.
How do so many people apear to have these super chill pet owls? Im sure some are part of animal shows/zoos etc but it seems like i see like 10 a day of kids or other pets playing with these big goofy snuggle birds and thats exactly 100%not how i thought owls kept in doors would be
