We are not them
"Snuffles" was my slave name. You shall now call me Snowball, because my fur is pretty and white.
Jerry, come to rub my face in urine again?
They were removed. Where have they gone?
Oh look! He's saying he loves lasagna.
Snuffles!! ü•∫
Oh, please tell me you're building a mech walker for him to sit in...
Alright, you‚Äôve convinced me. I‚Äôm watching rick and morty.
Oh my God! He's so cute! But, where are his testicles?
We are not them.....we are not *them*.
Aww, lil Bichon Frise

I had a bichon poodle mix, very cute doggies
Did you also forget to use a screw to keep the battery compartment closed
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
‚ÄúHuh! You think you can control me with a haircut?‚Äù

Jerry Smith Our God
My name is Snowball because my fur is pretty and white.
Lasagna
Here to shove my face in piss
His name is snowball, for his fur is fluffy and white
My dog is named Snowball, and I‚Äôve always wanted to do this. Does anyone have any idea how to make the helmet?

Summer: *Places face mask back on.
Lord Snowball!
So adorable!!
Snuffles!
Can someone explain the reference for out of touch old people like me?
Cute now please don't take over the world
You just made my day, my favorite episode!
It‚Äôs funny though because dressing your dog up like a cartoon character is the exact shit snowball wouldn‚Äôt stand for.
I think shes saying, "I like lasagna"
This is amazing üòÇ
Amazing
Is this the dog in my profile avatar??

Zoinks.
Snuffles! 
Or I should call you Snowball? monkaS
Wubba lubba dub dub !
If a male dog could be a human the first thing he would do is cut off your testicles, and then stick his own back on.
Come to rub my face in urine again?
r/rickandmorty
TAKE THAT OFF IT, THIS IS NOT THE YEAR!
Which breed is this?
Jerry, you've barely touched your lasagne
That is an intense line of questioning.
Incorrect PPE unfortunately

All Hail the Little White Dog!

The aliens can't control my thoughts
That's it. This wins the internet.
This just made my day. Thank you, honestly thank you.
Oh no
cute cute cuteness overload
That is on the money!
It don't matter,  still cute ‚ú®
Yes snowball
I love this idea. But is this a real costume or Photoshopped?
Oh wow. That's awesome. Looked like the real thing before clicking on the post.
look at my puppies, they‚Äôre not looking.
The lawnmower man, the movie the episode is loosely based on is one of the cult sci fi greats. Definitely recommend. Particularly the directors cut with the chimpanzee. Pierce Brosnan‚Äôs best movie IMO.
Props on the homemade costume skills. I legit thought it was a filter for a sec. Reminds me of Halloween costumes as a kid
What kind of dog is this ?
Ahhh jeez rick I don‚Äôt know bout this one
I was watching this episode yesterday
Them Not Are We?
Oh fuck
The bestest for space force <3
Best Rick and Morty Cosplay ever
Happy cake day
