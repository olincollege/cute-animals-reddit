I love how such a small thing can add so much flair and personality to a cake.
I love that they put frosting around the dog’s mouth too!

That dog is sooo well beheaved, munching on a tiny little bit of that cake.... my black lab would have eaten half of the cake already
Every millennial wedding is going to have this now. I'm not mad.
And a new trend begins. Or, an existing trend continues? I'm not really a wedding cake aficionado.
What if the one who made it actually made a mistake and brilliantly came up with "Well, how about including an adorable dog in your cake?"
The perfect wedding cake doesnt exi-
I'm the baker of this cake.. I made it for my cousins wedding yesterday. She wanted their amazing pup Leo incorporated. He attended the wedding as the ring bearer also. Thank you guys for all the love! And for those asking, we planned it like this, but it would have been a great way to cover up a mistake! Lol!!
I bet something happened to the cake on accident and this was the creative way to fix it. I'd be 100% fine with this fix!
That is adorable! My son on the autism spectrum saw it and said, "that is an honest marriage! The dog gets cake too!!" 

It takes something really funny to bring out his jokes!
What the actual fuck happened to that comment chain?
The golden trying to retrieve some gold inside the cake!

I think it would be wise for any cake decorator to have a selection of dogs and cats at the ready for every venue.

Cake gets damaged in transport? "Hey, do you two own a dog or cat? Yeh? What does  it look like?"
Fuzz baby!
Or the dog's just a ploy to make it seem intentional.

You'll know if you hit some extra cream near that part of the cake.
Looks like the “Groom’s Cake”
Some years ago my father was the commander of the Santa Maria Air Force Base (we're Brazilians) and we had just moved to our new home for the following four years, a duplex apartment in a condominium owned by the Air Force. We had come from Rio de Janeiro where we adopted a dog which I swear was the best dog in the world. We called her Blackie.

So, that night we had the Minister of the Air Force, the mayor, the state governor and some Uruguayan, Argentinian and some other dignitaries for a meeting. And there was this cake that was supposed to be served at the end.

Attending staff went everywhere doing chores to get the dinner working and I kept to the private area of the apartment doing my stuff.

Of course, someone left the door open and the dog got to the kitchen where the cake was ready to be served. And she ate about 1/4 of it. I went to get some food and found the dog. She stared at me as though she wanted to ask me if I wanted some of that awesome cake she had found. 

Bottom line, someone, I don't know who, ate a lot of frosting because the chief of the attending staff, after he was done laughing his ass off, literally filled the hole with it, and even remade the decorations. The cake went away and I know it was eaten whole, because I didn't get any of it.

I just wanted to share this story. Stray dogs are the best.
That dog needs to get out for a walk!
Stuff like this is a green flag that makes me think yup this is a happy home and will be an amazing marriage so excited for their happiness
Really mods? You deleted the highest upvoted comment thread?

Wow i wish i was that dog
My real dog made my wedding cake look like this at my wedding. Except it was a much larger chunk missing...
That looks like a good idea. I would add all the dogs I've grown up with. Especially my aunt's white fluffy boi who likes to pee on my tires. His pose will be pissing on the cake lol.
How did you find such a massive cake?
Best wedding cake
Now this is genius!
That is really clever
Very cool
Well I know what I'm doing for my wedding cake now
Its a cover up
I honestly need this cake except with a black Labrador for Luna, it’s perfect! ✨
Wow
My only wish for my wedding was that our golden had been able to travel there with us. Otherwise it was perfect.
Aww, bad boi! Beautiful cake though. :)
And yet when I take a small bite out of the caked its considered rude.
Marriage is like a deck of cards. In the beginning, all you need is two hearts and a diamond. By the end, you wish you had a club and a spade 👰 🎩
The twist? That's an actual dog and an oversized cake.
I'm sure it's deliberate in this case, but an excellent way to cover up cake damage on the big day
Mods deleted the comments lmao
Marriage expectations managed.
Seems like a cleaver way to disguise a mistake.
Why does Reddit worship dogs?
Is this night at the museum or something?
Basically [Marley & Me](https://youtu.be/Fj0c9pKaKpY).
This is the best wedding cake I've ever seen, no question.
Haha too cute
r/animalsbeingjerks but in cake form?
Solid idea if you accidentally fuck up a cake
Now I go ideas for including my cats
Is the dog edible?
I want this but instead of golden doggo I want a husky
Wow this is nice
this good boi def ate the original cake or at least got his own slice
For some reason it took me a lot of time to process what was going on in the picture. Initially I thought the dog is pissing on the cake. Time for sleep.
Congratulations to those getting married! Cool cake as well. Hope all is well and have a good one.
nice
D O G
Good boi.
Now I have to do that to my future wedding cake.
Holy shit!  So lifelike.
This is so incredibly cute!!! Love this!!!
But it turns out it isn’t a fake dog, but taxidermy
I zoomed in to see if one leg was up with some golden dripping side of the cake.
to have a small plastic dog nibble my wedding cake is the the only real reason to get married.
That is amazingly clever and cute. 

Love how they put some crumbs around it’s feet and frosting in the mouth. Little details like that make something good truly amazing.
As someone who owns a golden retriever, this is accurate af.
My old dog...
A very good boy
Saving this post for my future wedding
Not on my watch
The doggos eating the cake.
Family wedding cakes are awesome...♥️
Why do I have a strong feeling that the first time someone thought of doing this is because they accidentally damaged a cake, and don't have time to make another one, so they managed to turn it into something nice 😂
I had a yellow lab once.  Went to visit my parents and mom had just made a cake and was letting it cool on the dining room table.  You can probably guess what happened next.  Fast forward two years and the same thing happened to an iced cake in the same place.  He didn’t usually get into things like that but was two for two with moms cakes.   

I really miss that mischievous old guy
I need a distraction, so here goes.  This married couple will overcome a lot of obstacles that other couples wouldn't be able to.


Weddings have turned into produced and choreographed cinematic affairs.  Multiple photographers, caterers, musicians, LIGHTING CUES!?!?  


If there are dozens of gears in a machine, there are hundreds of ways that machine can break.  A wedding is way more complicated.  Things. will.  go.  wrong.  


*And this couple will laugh about it.*


* Uncle Kyle drank too much and is talking about aliens: *Oh well*
* Caterer didn't bring enough food: *Time for gourmet taco bell!*
* Musicians fell into a wormhole:  *Babe, break out your ipod!*
* Ringbearer Puppers found a puddle:  *The ring isn't very muddy*

I wish them luck, but a couple who can laugh at misfortune, they won't need it.  :champagne_glass:  

Cheers.
You fools! Now someone can pick at that side and just blame it on the dog.
I hope that dog isn't edible.
r/nextlevel how to cover a mistake
That mother fucker...o nvm
Just got the ok from the gf to do this
It would be adorable if the new husband puts a puppy eating the cake. Then the new wife goes to cut it and she is like “but we don’t have a puppy.” And then they bring out her new puppy. 

Side note I need to stop watching Tik Tok.
God I’m stupid.

I thought this was either a giant cake or an incredibly small dog for WAY too long.
Brilliant cake
That was an extra $300
Cutr
Heart cannot handle. Cuteness overload!
This makes me smile. I had to put my dog down a few years ago and once she took a huge bite of my grad cake and ran for the hills. It was chocolate so I spent some of my grad party trying to get her to puke. Gotta love em! She was the best dog ever.
Love this, the priority for the cake's design was their naughty dog. I approve 100% of all the choices that led up to this.
Best ever wedding cake.
Hello, this would be my wedding cake me and my husband are overwhelmed with how many of you love it! Here’s a little back story on why we chose to do this! We have a 2 year old golden his name is Leo, he’s  a heccin good boy but from time to time he gets into things (hard to  believe right?), well we wanted to show the real him, we constantly post stories of him on social media so our friends/family know his personality well. This made everyone laugh and was a perfect way to include him on our cake. He walked down the isle as well and just made our day complete 😭
Eat the dog first
Plot twist: the cake decorators dog got into the cake and this was the clever cover-up.
Clever way to cover up a mistake
That is such an adorable cake.  Obviously a loving dog couple with senses of humor getting married
This only works if the cake is not chocolate.
I would LOVE to know the story behind that cake!
Oh my gosh.....so cute!!
What beautiful wedding cakes 🎂 what a beautiful master piece.
This is a good idea if your cake gets a bit damaged
DOH!
Hahahahaha hahahaaah
aww
Reddit Twist:  The dog is marrying a cake.
"We have a wedding to go to it.
This is some great level artistic
Attention to detail. 50% chance of failing
Lmfaooo yesssss!!! I love it!!!!
Who needs the actual people getting married when you have dog
So, do we eat the yellow cake or not?
[deleted]
Nice!
Thats a cool way to fix a finger oops
Damn that cake is big when compared to the dog
My dog did that for real. Ate a lot more of the cake than that. It was a proper fruit cake soaked in brandy.
If this ain’t my wedding cake, I don’t want it
so cuteeee
How cute!
Awesome
My standard for wedding cakes is updated
Vno
mmmm meat cake
Cute.
What's his name?
That's an amazing idea!
what about the turd after the meal
I got cake today, but no dog
ohmygosh that is just the cutest thing. Such a testament to how important their furry bud is
Now I know what to do when I mess up my cakes
At least they didn't made peeing on the cake
Cleo!
Thats fucking awesome.
What a great way to add your best furry friend into your special day! Such a fun memory this will be for everyone there! Although if it was my dog, more than just a small little nibble would have disappeared from the cake and he would be on the OTHER side looking guilty lol
I only really appreciated fully the other day how much of an art form baking was when I saw how much time went into modelling. Amazing and hypnotising
Wuv it
That’s awesome.
hahaha, that is labradorable
Imagine if they had to add the dog because they accidentally took that part of the cake out
Must be a chinese wedding
I'd be the one to eat the dog.
And doggie makes three.
If only it were chocolate cake
My dog would’ve eaten the whole cake 🤷🏽‍♀️
awwww so cute
Less wedding cakes more masks
Sorry but I will be stealing this. So cute
That's so cute
I get the dogs ass as my desert
this is cute
No, my cousin bought the set on Amazon! He is a figurine.
This is great!
This is so cute and silly oh my gosh. If I were ever to have a wedding cake, I’d so want something like this. xD
Oh I love this❤️
A subtle hint that someone’s getting a dog as a wedding gift.
Alright. I’m gonna have to divorce and then remarry my husband so I can steal this idea at our second wedding.
“Sorry, I was kinda hungry.”
Lower Decks dog vibes.
Omg yassssss ❤️❤️❤️
Looks like you have a tiny dog infestation here, who's your pest guy?
The comments are all so good...funny...and entertaining, I really can't add much.  Enough to make me wish I was getting married though.  Question: is the dog male or female?  I say male.  Can't help getting his nose in the "cake" before the wedding!?!?!
r/weddingshaming

Jk
Does anyone know what the comment that got removed was
Adorable.
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 iyyyyy like it!
Are we all banned
That’s cute
That's so heartwarming :)
When i was a child, my dog ate like half of my birthday cake... lol
Very cool! Congratulations 🎈🍾🎉
HEY GUYS, IM THE BAKER AND I SIGNED UP FOR A CONTEST, PLEASE GO VOTE FOR ME!!

 https://greatestbaker.com/2020/sarah-west
Ha! That's great.
That's not a small dog. That's a massive fucking cake.
He didn’t do it🤥
A good boi
Wholesomeness 100
Should have had him lifting his leg on it!!!
Cutest thing I've ever seen
Cats are superior
Makes me really wonder if the baker did that or some 6 year old
Everything is fine but don't let the dog piss on this beautiful cake 😂
Are you the person who posted this in dogspotting society? Or did you ask to share?

This is hella cute but credit should go where it's due
Eww gross
Needs a pee spot
My best guess is that the person who made/delivered the cake messed up and accidentally squished that part. To save himself, he put a dog besides it and made it look like the dog ate it. Cute.
WHAT A GOOD DOGGO!! 🐶😭🥰
He fucked the cake
fUCK YOU!!!!!!🛴🛴🛴🛴🛴🚛
Why is it cute that a dog peed on the cake? Gross.
