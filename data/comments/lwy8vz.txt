Wonderful title
Chocolate labradors in a nutshell. I'm just surprised the Australian Shepherd didn't have a matching energy level.
Am I the only one who saw some regret about halfway through the roll?
DO A BARREL ROLL
My brain was not entirely sure how to process that the first time watching
That gave the chuckle I definitely need today.
You spin me right round baby, right round, like a record baby, right round round round
Oh, my heart!
It's not really even a twist it's more of a spin

... I might do the spin
Sometimes I wonder what is going on in some dogs heads.
I... was not expecting that.

How do I copy videos like this directly so I can share them with people?
First dog is deffo middle sibling and is, I'd bet, waiting to choke tf out of him once camera person leaves.

Best fucking thing in internet today
Saving this video for bad days
Chaos ensues behind closed doors
Was the first thing dog the soap and the second one the spin cycle?
Why am I so positive that there is some kind of TREAT outside the view of the camera? I had a black lab, ALL and I mean all they think and do is for THE EAT.
A hole I must look out
My head I must twist about 
Look at me I’ve got tricks 
Come closer, get some licks
