the blonde leading the blonde
That blind beautiful dog has no idea how many countless hearts he or she is touching just being themselves.
The amount of trust and love they have between them just melts my heart!
Are these the doggos from @thegoldensrule on Instagram?
Us human friends should strive to meet the golden standard of friendship
Reddit is making me feel all gooey and better today. So sweet.
I had to remind myself that dogs aren't self-aware and the blind dog doesn't know it's blind. It's just being a dog. If I didn't I'd cry.
Can someone link the viral post?
Cute to infinity. Woof!!
"Hey lemme... lemme get some of that drool out of your mouth" - weird but good dog
Original post? I missed it.
I just watches Detective Pikachu and all I can see here is a Golden and a Ditto :)
I often think this world is just an endless slap in the face of misery. I often question what’s the point. Then I’m reminded of the most genuine, pure love that is dogs and I smile. The way this blind doggo leans into its guide friend is adorable and just so precious. I didn’t expect to be backhanded with some feels, but here it is.
r/PetsWithPets
Thanks for the update! Those two are too cute.
Jake and Addie are so sweet! Jake had to have his eyes removed about a year ago due to a severe illness/disease. Addie was by his side through the entire process. Such sweet puppies. They post lots of cute photos on Instagram: thegoldensrule
These are actually my parents’ dogs. I’ll try my best to answer a few of the questions I’ve seen on this post. Addie is lighter colored golden and Jake is the darker, blind golden. Jake had seizures from the time he was a puppy and eventually began having issues with his eyes. I’m not sure of the specifics, but I know his eye lashes inverted and he quit producing tears. He was always squinting and seemed to be in obvious pain. 

My parents tried other surgeries to try and spare his eyes, but eventually the vet said he had some sort of ulcers on his corneas and his eyes could basically pop. He said they should either put him to sleep or have his eyes removed (enucleated). My parents thought and prayed about it. They reached out to friends they had made on Instagram who had dogs in the same situation who had their eyes removed. Ultimately they were relieved to find out what a lot of you had said about vision being 3rd most important sense that dogs have behind smell and hearing. 

Today Jake seems far happier than ever. He gets around my parents’ house great (they just can’t ever rearrange the furniture). He still loves going for walks, taking road trips like in the gif above, listening to the deer at the lake, and of course getting lots of pets. He also has quite a few less seizures than he ever did before. 

Addie does a great job at leading Jake around and playing with him. They like to use each other as pillows whenever possible. As far as if Addie knows Jake is blind, I think she does. She seems to look after him more than she did before. She is about a year and a half younger than Jake and my parents got her after they had Jake, so she used to seem more like the baby and Jake would look after her. Also, after Jake had his surgery, my parents had to keep Addie from licking at his stitches. Of course dogs do this all the time, but I think she could tell something happened to him. She acted much more like a mother after that and was more gentle with him. 

If you have any more questions I would be happy to do my best to answer them! Feel free to follow along on their adventures on Instagram (@thegoldensrule)!
The kisses!! 😍😭💕💕
So if she goes missing he goes to retrieve her
They love each other! 🥰
It... it’s a Ditto. I’m sorry
Let me feel your face...
Onions
I love them so much.
“Thanks for showing me around fren”


“Yea, no problem. You think we’re gonna get treats soon?”
imagine the sense of smell on that blind dog. could probably smell your fart from another state.
This is what we like to call a pupdate
I have a question do blind dogs willingly keep their eyes closed or does something surgical happen?
[deleted]
If this doesn't get to you nothing will. Sweetest thing ever.
Can someone link the first post that went viral?
They love each other
Snuggle-kissy kissy-snuggle

What a great combo
That's some enteral friendship right there
That's so sweet
This is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Thank you for sharing.
As someone who is a golden owner, they are extremely special animals. I've owned several breeds before my special girl, but none compare to the love and personality she brings.
What a pair of beautiful doggos! 😍
I can feel the love
Ngl I teared up a bit. So beautiful!
I’d pay 50 bucks to spend an hour with these two.
i lik the fren
dogs don’t deserve to be blind. My poor heart ahhh
I want to give him googly eyes
This world does not deserve them! Their humans do though! They are awesome!
Doesn't matter if the blind knows he is blind or the other is aware that he is different, when u see how close they are and how they help each other it just makes your heart full.  Full of love that is. I need to see this once a day to feel the love before I step out to meet the sometimes harsh world!  I just want to say I love you dear wonderful doggos!
It looks like a dog and a ditto trying to pretend he's a dog.
So beautiful.
They are the best boys.
Things like this break my heart cause all my mind goes to is “one day one of them will pass and the other will wonder where he/she is at.”
.. We done it, we reached the peak of cuteness, hapiness and fullfilment
That is literally the sweetest thing I have ever read. What a couple of wonderful doggo’s.
If anyone has a link to their story Id love to give it a read
So. Effing. Sweet. Dogs are the best
First time in this sub I've ever actually said "aww". Wow!
I'M NOT CRYING                     i^(am)
The blind doggo is cuddlng the guide doggo. Absolute upvote from me
This might be the most wholesome thing I've seen today
I work at a hotel they featured on their Instagram. I got to meet them and was amazed at how his brother guided him around making sure he didn't run into anything. The whole family was extremely friendly and i got to be on one of their posts!
I dont have a heart anymore cause mine just melted 💞
He/she still has 4 senses. Touch, hear, smell, and love.
OMFG my freaking heart!
Oh my goodness. I love them so much.
Original post?
This was the first post I saw. I think I’m just gonna hop off on a good note
i’m crying 🥺❤️
That's not a blind dog.

That's a motherfucking ditto.
So a dog seeing-eye dog
Legit in tears right now
Put tears in my eyes. If only people could be so kind.
We as humans can learn a lot from this.
Dogs are nature's gift to mankind.

Fate selected the people they like best and gifted them labradors. These dogs are lovable.
Get him sunglasses since they won't bother him as much, now that would be one cool boy
Just out of curiosity,  every time I see a blind animal post, it seems they have their eyes removed. Is this by veterinary design? Is their a risk in allowing blind eyes to be retained?
Oh dear, my heart is going to burst right open! 🥰🥰🥰
Aaaaaaw😍
The first time I audibly have said awww
I’m not crying you’re crying!
How do these dogs go blind?
Here's my blind baby Mr. Magoo <3

So precious...we don’t deserve them.
Dog’s best friend!
This is definitely what I needed to wake up to this morning 😍
Did not see them before but they are absolutely beautiful indeed.
I love them both so much
Both are so beautiful 🤩
My heart melted
r/rarepuppers
What a story! That is awesome, I'd only does it melt their hearts but it also makes us all smile at the same time. Please keep everyoneupdated from time to time
I may not be able to see, but I can smell so good I'm the best tooth cleaner around! :)
So cute
So many life lessons here!
My heart......
AWWW no wayy!! I'm crying again
This is the most wholesome thing I have ever laid eyes on
This. Is. AWESOME.
I wish I could be half as loving and understanding as a dog is.
So presh.
I love them!
Love the smudge on the snout. Golden’s are just the best
Absolutely wholesome
Uffff
So touching. They look so happy
I miss Smiley....
Those are some r/nicesheep s
This is the definition of good boys isn't it. Put this video in a dictionary. We are done
That's brilliant!
Aww amazing

I would subscribe to their channel.
Did the guide dog just take to helping the other or was it trained to do so specificity for the other dog or would it guide for a human also?
I love them
Pretty sure OP doesn't own these dogs and is just a karma farmer.
Poor thing :(
These dogs are so adorable.
Im on reddit everyday for an embarrasing amount of time and i never saw them
I love you babies
This is so precious!
God dammit they're so beautiful.
I feel conflicted about calling this r/eyebleach...
I love them so much
Two absolute beauties.
*insert wholesome comment*
So wonderful and loving!
My heart has melted away so cute :)
The love there is immeasurable❤
I melt with you
This made me so happy. Thanks.

There's a book like this. It's called The trouble with Tuck. When I was 11, I named my dog (a Lab) after the dog in that book. ❤
This is Charlie and Maverick! They are adorable to follow :-)
I have a cat  that is breaking 20 years soon and is fully deaf and blind. 

He has an equally old brother but the brother doesn't realize why the blind cat keeps walking into things. It's quite sad and I wish I had a solution but taken into account he is as well blind as he is deaf and 19+ years old we are gonna go to the vet next week ready to put him down.
Needed this smile today. Thanks.
even blind dogs need guide dogs
RenindMe! 1 mintue
This is too sweet
They are loving each other well😍
Cool
Yghdv
If you're relationship isn't as solid as these two, what's the point of having it in the first place?
It looks like Ditto used transformed and transformed into this good boy!
I don't ever say this but #RelationshipGolas
This is awesome! I'm curious how this friendship started. How did the guide dog know to guide that dog, and how did they blind dog know to follow it?
Stuff like this is about the only thing that keeps me coming back to Reddit. The other 99% of it is flaming hot garbage.
How can we follow them?
I can smell this gif lol 

RETRIEVER BREATH
 Glad to see that they’re both good compared to that other blind dog duo.
This is so sweet!
Love them, precious pups
The fact that dogs can have seeing eye dogs fills me with incredible joy
I follow them on instagram.  They are cute.
You mean dogs have service dogs?  That is amazing.
Thanks I really needed to start crying at dinner
Oh heck, have an upvote.
beautiful
I'm not crying, you are. ;-;
"Dude, chill. The camera is on. What will my my dad think. Chill. Later."
So so sweet...
What a beautiful pair...are they a couple? <3
Glad that I saw this meme twice cause I forgot to fucking upvote it 1,637,526 times.
Great part about a blind puppy is, far as they're concerned, everyone is blind!  That's just how it is!  They are probably crazy impressed with our ability to navigate totally blind.
God bless whoever take care of them.
I'm not crying you are
The blind dog looks like a dog imitated by Ditto.

Awwe omg that's is the sweetest thing ever 😍💯
Good boys
Why does that one dog look beaten up? (the not blind one)
My heart
Does someone have link to original post?
Just doing my job, sir.
O m g
Awesome
I want to see more I would literally unsubscribe every yt channel I follow just to see these two sweet amazing pooches everyday. I'm crying.
Awwwww such good puppers ♥️
Aww
This breaks my heart but also makes me so happy!
I cried then hugged my dogs so tight. It's too cute
I've had a really hard day but this has warmed my heart. Angels <3
May we also see the original post from months ago?
My heart can’t take the adorable ness of this
[removed]
And they went viral again 😊
Im sure some contacts will do fine
Just cutting onions over here. Not crying.
In some ways blind dogs are blessed in that they probably have no concept of what they are missing out on and are just happy to be enjoying life.
Take all my silver.
If a blind person's other senses are stronger than a normal person's, and a dog's sense of smell is thousands of times greater than a human's, how powerful must this blind dog's sense of smell be?
They are my neighbors and it is an aww moment everyday to see them together.
Woah what
Had an older golden named Dexter that was my best bud and went blind due to diabetes. Adopted two golden brothers, and one, Ranger, took to Dexter immediately. Guided him when he was confused. Wouldn't leave him in the yard until he knew where he was and how to get back on the deck and in the house. Always played within a close proximity with the other golden so he felt included, and always cuddled with him. Dexter died last year and Ranger helped me through that loss. He's now my best bud. Golden's just rule.
What adorable puppers
God I miss my dog.
Are these guys in toronto?

I swear I saw the two of them out walking with their owners the other day? Two big beautiful retrievers and the one caught my attention because he had no eyes, just like that.
Doesn't that dog know he's not supposed to play with service animals? For shame!
Why are my eyes wet
Gorgeous dogs.
The love is beautiful.
Where were going we don't need eyes.
Mlem mlem mlem
Anyone ever notice how golden retrievers are so good?
Mmmm I love the taste of that sweet, sweet slobber.
We're they related to each other?
gotta be careful of galvanic corrosion...
She was trained for this!
Awwwww doggy kisses that’s so sweet !
Cryin. In. The. Club. Right. Now.
Yeah whatever I’m crying
This is all I needed to see tonight. My heart is full.
Dogs riding in cars should be wearing dog safety belt harnesses.  They're cheap and effective.

You'd buckle up a child, buckle up your dogs! They trust you, don't betray that trust.
I would die for both of them.
Dogs are fantanstic, he probably gives zero fucks to being blind, that is the world as he know and he loves to be alive
Fuck yes. Best thing I've seen all week.
/u/VideoDownloader
I'm a blubbering fool now! And im at a brewery!
i love them
Loved this post..
Serious question: do the blind dog and the guide need some kind of special training?
This is just wonderful, just some happy pups enjoying life.
Hnnng too wholesome
Something doesn't look right
I have a a beart of stone but its still melt my fucking heart
I can't handle this!!
This melts my heart! I love them I love them I love them
What a pair of beautiful dogs, Made my day !!!
Awww
Love doggos
For some reason I thought the blind person who had a blind guide dog who had a guide dog... which I am Now disappointed that it is not the case
So freaking cute!!!!!
Ahhh man I love goldens
Oh lord this makes my heart happy
I’m so happy to hear it!
That is the best thing I have seen in weeks. Dogs are so amazing.
Mean nothing but love for those beautiful Golden’s. Bad blonde joke: did you hear about the two blondes that walked into a building?? Figured one of them would of seen it!!  

I so miss my golden. Most loyal beauties in the world. Cheers for sharing. Apologies for the dumb joke...
❤️
I had a Springer-spaniel when I was a kid that suddenly went blind at the age of 2. He was a good pupper! Eventually he lost an eye aswell. He also use to ring the door bell when he wanted to come inside the house. We called him out Ringer-spaniel.
"I dont know whats happening but you smell good and I love you"
I can't see you but I love you!
FANTASTIC!
Mice boyes ♥️
Love
I love how dogs are even like, "ok, i love you too but please stop licking my face. "
I could literally watch that all day...So comforting.
My dog went blind overnight a couple of months ago. I wish he had a partner like that.
I love this! I knew a pair of dogs that were in the same kind of relationship at a local rescue. One dog lead the blind dog around for like two years when all of a sudden they started hating each other for some reason and had to be separated and adopted to different homes. I'm glad this working out here 😭
I actually started crying it’s too cute
Oh. That just makes me cry, it’s so beautiful!
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Wow.
This is why we are alive
Everyone Liked That
Awww!!! So adorable
MY HEART
Not even dogs like having their face licked.
I scrolled through the comments cause I wanted to know if shitty and toxic people even come to these lovely posts. Well, yeah, but at least they're just a few. Hope they go extinct someday.  
  
Hope doggos never get contaminated by those.
“You still with me bud? Okay, great.”
I needed to see this today. Thank you.
The car ride looks cosy
And you can tell the blind dog is still living his best life and smiling cuz what can you do? Awwww
Listen. I truly love dogs, I do. But has anyone noticed that the blind retriever looks like what Ditto (The Pokemon) would look like if he shapeshifted into a retriever? 

P.S. I love dogs and get big feels watching this video.
Made my day

Doggo are the best thing in this world, and yes keanu reeves too
They both kind of look like Henry Winkler.
The blind dog’s lack of eyes make it look like he is eternally at maximum excitement
"You are blind, therefore I am better than you. I will smile but ignore you."

Edit: missed the first second. Darned mobile!
Those are some really fuckin good boys
😭
Absolutely adorable, they both look so happy!
My heart is exploding. What good doggos
SCP-939 has breached containment
Are his eyes sewn shut? I have a friend who’s dog lost an eye and they sewed the the kids shut to keep debris from getting in there and from scratching it when playing with other dogs
Everyone needs a good dog even a goos dog :)
Are their names Jake and Addy? I’ve followed them on instagram for a while... they are so sweet!!
Awwww man i love this
So much love shown here in the bond between these too! <3
Honestly we ship
At first this brought me joy. Then it brought me sadness. Imagine how the blind dog would feel if his friend was no longer there. How lost he would feel, not understanding why is buddy is gone. Just sad and dark.
Those kisses absolutely melts your heart
❤️❤️❤️
How did he lose his eyes?
Shit!..... I failed. I like jake
[Blind dog]: What do you see? 
[Other dog, incapable of speaking English]: Bork
These two are couple goals!
Awwwwwwwwww omg this is so frikin precious!!
Isn't it true that dogs lick the face of those they think are leaders or in charge? 

Interesting that the blind dog knows he kinda owes his life to the guide dog. Very strong bond ❤️
That’s true love
This is literally the best thing
r /givememoredogsplease
Canadian, so I have to say "wonderfully" /s
My heart exploded in happiness! i wish both the guide dog and the blind dog the absolute best!
😍😍love them 😗
Please put googley eyes on the blind one and post another video. 🙃
They’re maaaaaaried!!!
What happens if the guide dog goes blind
I have a blind (one-eyed and blind in the other eye) [cat](https://imgur.com/gallery/u8afOZw) 
He is completely bonkers and gets along as well as any other cat. We just have to be careful about moving furniture or putting things in his path. He runs at full speed at all times.
Ugh my heart
This just melted my heart
Thats a ditto
Just today I convinced my children that blind dogs get small guide humans.

Thanks a lot, Reddit.
Pure....AF!
Why aren’t you giving any credit to them? This is from their Instagram.
Blind dog give karma
Bless their souls
Wow another top video I have to add the the hall of fame for tear jerkers.
Very helpful dog
Cuteness overload oh god >.<
So I have a rule now which was borne of sadness.

1 dog or 3 dogs but never 2 dogs.
As much as humans have had a negative impact on earth (it’s a long list) the best thing we did was breed dogs. My favorite animal... wild or not.
I actually blurted out “awww” when I saw this and didn’t realize what sub this was.
I really want to see the guidance system in work.
If they dont pass away peacefully at the exact same moment someday, i'll cry big wet man tears
I worked next to one of the owners. @TheGoldensRule on Instagram
My friend has two great danes, one of which is deaf, and a great big backyard to run around in.  When she wants the deaf one to come in, she sends the hearing one out to go get him.
NO YOU'RE CRYING
What viral video? I scrolled through 5 minutes worth of comments and haven’t found a link?
Are they in love🥺
do they have an instagram page we can see?
I ship them.
i love dogs so much they make existing that much more tolerable
100K UPVOTES!
So wholesome
The show of appreciation from the blind golden is heartwarming.
Melts my heart, why can't people be like that minus the licking...…..
Omg no offense but the left one looks like a ditto from Pokémon
Animals are so amazing; humans can learn a lot from them.
Omg, they are gorgeous!
They are beautiful. thank you for sharing OP!
are they both males?
Oh it's just pure love, so sweet.
That's the best
Golden’s look like Owen Wilson to me.
love it
This is my favorite Reddit pair! They’re too dang sweet and adorable! ❤️
I'm so in love with these two 💜♥️💜♥️😭😭😭
Love
The blind dog leading the human, and the other dog leading the blind dog.
If you say so, I saw this and the first post here and nowhere else.
"a blind dog and his guide dog" You mean two best friends?
Super sweet but this was 6 days ago... new front page post please
Id sell him to the chinease right away

Dog and its Ditto replica
Wonderfully. Wonderful is an adjective. To make it an adverb, which is a word that modifies a verb, add -ly
Man dogs really are the most fuckin pure creatures I've ever seen. Honestly screw all the people that hurt dogs or don't like them.
I hate seeing disbled animals on reddit. Everytime I make a new account I need to remember to unsub from this.

I could say WHOS CUTTING ONIONS IN HEUR, for ez karma but nah.
Seeing eye hooman
That's weird. How could a dog without eyes be a good guide dog?
That is absolutely the most terrifying blind dog I have ever seen. Get this dog some sunglasses.
Gross. Downvoted.
Jesus christ, we've reached the point where dogs are having service dogs.
I pee in the shower
I'm not crying, you're crying!
Why do they have dried blood staining their fur?!?!
Wow thanks reddit for updating me against my will. I can't see it. Just an arrow and white. And nothing. 

White screen is all I see besides the arrow. 

There should be names of people who make decisions like this. It must be Chad. Fuck you Chad. Cooking shit, funny shit, heartwarming shit...I can't see it now because of the change. That I did not ask for. Am I an experiment?  

Seriously, fuck you Chad. Or Chadesse.
Sure its cute. But a dog doesnt need a blind dog. Thats just stupid.
I’m not crying, you are
They are good boys/girls but my god he is terrifying
"went viral" lmao
Just leave them both in the woods
*here’s an update to get me lots of karma, awards, and attention
[removed]
A fucking dog that has an owner to take care of it gets a service animal while people who actually need them can't get them and reddit just eats this shit right up. I'm done.
