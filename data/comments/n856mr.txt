*PTSD Flashbacks of Cupcake Dog*
Poor dog, Aussies are so obsessive and just fixate like that.
That dog is more patient than most people I know
What a good boy!
Those of us with Aussies know what this is like lol.   


With mine, I can literally watch an entire movie with the ball in my hand and he will wait patiently
“Ball! Ball! I want ball! Ball! Throw ball human! Throw!!!”
Man that couch is close to that TV
That couch getting rained on
Any minute now....
Heartbreaking.
Poor dog..
It's always impressive how long dogs can wait for something.
/r/ThrowTheDamnBall
When he drops into deeper sleep his body is going to relax and the ball might drop, so there is some hope for the doggo.
Good dog.
Reminds me of that Fururama episode
Bless his big dumb heart
Well? Did he?
My dog would have barked at me by now. Lol
Doggo is r/peopledyinginside
This is the most I’ve laughed in a year I think, that you so much for this

He’s got 4 paws and heart and wants to use all 5 of them
Are we just not going to talk a lot how that TV is immediately at the end of the couch? It’s making me uncomfortable how close it is.
that guy is so bryan doyle murray.
Wake that old fucker up and get that dog the ball
Lol for real, he is such a patient doggo
My lab would do the same thing 😂
Lmao that human is a faker.
Dogs like that are smart enough to know.
Poor pupper just waiting patiently 🥰🤗🤗🤗
Someone is playing dead...
*Why are we still here? Just to suffer?*
Great demonstration of the vigilance of working dog breeds
That  cushion is drenched in drool
RIP Stan Lee
Some say the dog is still waiting.
Reminds me of that Futurama episode with Fry's dog.
Americans waiting on Biden to cancel student loan debt like...
man there ain't no nap like getting swallowed in the corner of a comfy couch nap
u/youwannagokiddo
That's what you call a ball junkie.

Not good. 

We had to limit our border collies time with balls to combat this behavior and actively train to ignore the ball. It looks cute and like they have fun but it's not behavior that you should want from your dog. The fixation is too high.
That's fucked up on a first world level.
Dog so cute ❤️
Ngl it's sad, like a beautiful peice of art sad.  

The little boy gets old, wants to play, but can't.   

The dog only wants it's most fondest of memories. To play with the boy.

Such a good boy
He waited
I wanna know how long he was doing this for. This is hilarious.
Poor little creature 🥰
Please cartoon this.
...any moment now...
I am surprised that the dog does not know that its human is sleeping
Dog
My old boss had a dog like this. The ball was ALL it cared about.
Fun fact: he's actually dead
“No matter what happens, never, never take your eye off the ball.”
Who else here was hoping the doggo would snatch that ball out his hand?
💚💙❤️
Plot twist: Flashing blue lights are from the ambulance pulling up.  He will never wake to throw the ball again.
This reminds me of Hachi waiting at the train station for his dead owner to come home
Man you've gotta love his optimism 😂
any time now!
I swear this guy looks just like my Uncle Larry.
OMG this is from the IG whataboutbunny. It's the cutest!

Cute! That is one optimistic puppy
This is heartbreaking
He's diligent I'll give him that.
Aww that makes me sad for him
Is anyone else thinking that dog really knows how to keep their eye on the ball?
whta a patient good doogoo <3
Awwww!
Patience in person - that's what that Aussie is. <3
A doge of focus and sheer fricking will
*flashbacks Fry's Dog*.. at least his not dead

The man looks like Dean Radin. Is it him?

That that looks like it’s about to get an anxiety attack waiting for the ball
*he never woke up*
When he throws it I'll catch, and when I catch I'll catch it.
I think this dog likes to play ball
My heart for this.
Stop filming and throw the damn ball already :(
legend says he is still waiting..
Every chump left on read.
plot twist: he ded
This is when grandpa pulled the biggest prank and never woke up again…
My Pomeranian would’ve snuck up there and taken it out of my hand.
When you’re waiting for Elon to pump your coin
I have a Border Collie coming up for 1 year old. She is obsessed with fetch.

Played ball with her for 6 hours straight in a friend's garden while we was chilling. Came home and she instantly grabbed a ball and threw it to my feet...
"Dog waiting for his dead owner to throw him the ball..."
What’s that lassie? Dad needs naracaned again?
Dude this is my cousin filming and my uncle wtf! Scrolling through Reddit and bam, there they are! Hahahaha what’s up Jacob!
Imagine the dog just waiting there for the ball for years after the guy died.
❤️
No throw, only take.
Fkin border collies obsessed with balls
r/AnimalsBeingDerps

Is the old man alive? I really hope so, such a good dog!! :'(

Poor pup, and also lol is that Wilfred Brimley?
Australian shepherd that's the breed.
Noooo this makes me so sad :(((((
Awwww the sad faces
You have to admire the endless optimism of dogs!
His wait for the next play when his owner wake up!
What is on its head ?
I'm calling fake. Dogs know when their owners are sleeping.
Plot twist: He died many years ago, but the dry air made him mumified.
My dog does this. except persistently barks to make sure you know he is still there when you dont throw the ball.
The guy filming is a devil
Is this the sequel to Hachiko?
More like r/WatchPeopleDieInside
Pawwlease hooman wake up and throw me that ball 🥺
That poor dog…He is so lost in time. 😆
My dumb dog that I love is stealing my pillow right now. It’s 530 Am.

"we don't deserve dogs"
I wake up all the time with dog toys next to me :) I guess my dog brings me toys wanting to play, gives up and goes to bed
Is he ded?
That couch looks so comfy
Dad's and their dogs ❤️
Too freakin cute !
Mah heart
This is the most border collie thing ever
That is the definition of attention span.
Lol
This proves our brain superiority over dogs lol 😂
Patience is a virtue.
Awwww poor puppers
Omg this is exactly what my dog does. I work nights so while I sleep in the day she places the ball in my hand and waits just like that but keeps nudging my hand every few minutes to wake me
Is it an Australian shepherd?
Damn that couch is close to the tv.
Not if that's the diabetes guy
Grandpa: \*dies\*  
Dog: just one more minute
Stan Lee?
He’s ded
To much dog for that old man...
So sweet
This is actually kind of creepy.
The meaning of keep your eyes on the prize
........ any second NOW! I woofs and waits! (Or wakes with woofs)
This subreddit has been won. We need a permanent pin for this.
Is it just me or is that couch too big for the room?  It's so freaking close to the TV
"how many hours before friend becomes food?"
You know its good when you say "omg you need to see this to whoever is in the room"
They dont call em Mans Smartest Friend
And if he doesn't wake up, then... \*licks lips\*
Bert Kreischers dad?
"Any minute now..."
This dog will become a statue untill that man wakes up
We should think outside the box not inside the box
The best things in life are worth the long wait
This is brilliant...laughing so much...
you sure?
this is the purest thing i have ever witnessed
We don't deserve dogs. They are so pure.
Plot twist, he is dead and will never throw again
That’s what you look like when you see your whole career getting destroyed in front of you
It has been 10,000 years since my lord has thrown the ball, but I as his loyal colliestodes shall wait an eternity for the god emperor of ballkind to rise from his brownish throne and yeet the ball of mankind untue the room of living. It has been 17 whole seconds since I have wavered from my task, but I am prepared to wait an eternity if I must.
But he never did
Well , it has been 4 days now .
Always  keep your eye on the ball
Did that guy work at PAFB as a telemetry engineer?  He look familiar to me but I don't want to use names here
If i ever feel asleep on the couch wr had a Pomeranian that would pile every toy he owned on the floor in front of me trying to get me to play fetch
This is the kind of patience I need in life.
“Hey dad can you take the ball from the dog, and pretend to sleep while he watches it. It’ll make for a great video and I can get tons of karma on reddit probably and fuel my need for internet points!”
I have a dogge just like this https://youtu.be/j5a0jTc9S10
Makes me wonder what food was on the plate when he fell asleep
PTSD dog has to face another disappointment.
First time I've laughed my ass of within 5 minutes of waking up. It's gonna be a good day.
My border collie is exactly the same
We do not deserve dogs.
In evil Palpatine voice:

 Yes......you want this don't you?
Plot twist OP  is an eHarmony employee and this is just a shameless plug for the commercial on TV￼
Dammit Brian Doyle-Murray, wake up and throw the ball.
What a patient dog!
Hurry up. It’s been 3 days
poor doggo :(
I need to get a puppy
r/throwthedamnball
Is he dead?
"I think it moved."
Just throw the ball already you monster
He's pretending to sleep for the camera lol
Such patience
We don’t deserve doggos
Aussies are incredibly focused and patient to the point of sociopath.

Source: have two
Just like coach taught him: Never take your eye off the ball.
Ball is life
Real Hachi vibes
Lmao is that your dad, op? He looks like a great person lol
All of retail waiting for the MOASS
Heartbreaking...
Is this the same dog that wanted that plate of cupcakes?
Hahaha why is this my dog? Also an Aussie btw.
He never woke up...
This is kinda heartbreaking.  I hope the person filming got the ball and threw it immediately after this.
The absolute desperation in the dog's eyes kills me.
Some dogs are self made.
But little did that dig know, he would never wake up again
I need this dog holding crypto for me. Patience level = god
Omg cute
Aww
My dog wouldn't be this patient.  She would nudge my hand with her wet nose, then lick my hand.  If that didn't work, she would start barking until I woke up.
Fucking Rolf! Take my upvote
What a tease.
"No throw, only take" grand master.
r/maybemaybemaybe
good
Narrator "He never did wake up"
Mah hart mah sol.
Or he may never throw it again.  RIP grandpa… ok you gonna throw it now?
So anyway, the hearse pulled up 40 minutes later.
When ball is life
When you about to throw a ball but die instead
oh no its seymour all over again
unstoppable force meets immovable object
No comments on how that huge tv is like 4 feet away from the dudes face?
Hopefully has short naps haha
This video hurts my heart 💔
Why does this dog remind me of Fry's dog from futurama where he waits for Fry outside his work for the rest of his life :(
Should try whimpering or barking lol
RIP grampy
He will never wake up
Man, I had a collie mix that was just 100% about the damn ball. Never cuddled. Never wanted to go on walks. Don’t even know if the fucker even ate food. Just BALL, BALL, BALL!!! I barely remember that dog.
Dog does not sleep.

Dog waits.
Welp , he died

That is some serious staring going on right there.

I dont think this is good behavior...
He is so fixed to the ball.
Happens a lot with herding dogs.Could be sticks or some toys and it is realy hard to fix...
cute and sad at the same time
LOL exactly!
