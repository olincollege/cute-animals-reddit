I love the way they work around the cat. Like it's amazing that this is something they go and do each night, but even more so to me that the cat starts in the middle and waits for the worlds best whirlpool to suck them up and carry them away to cozyland. . 
I will never in my life be as god-tier comfy as this cat.
Looks very cozy for the cat, but one of the dogs is laying on a ball. 
Not sure if the warmth is from the dogs or the heater ‚ù§
This is quite possibly the cutest thing I've ever seen! 
Cat: "Heated bed, assemble.   Very good."
Real pack mentality here.  The two biggest members are keeping the littlest pack member safe in the middle 
That‚Äôs what I call being successful in life 
They even form a heart
cat: "time for bed fellow dogs"
Is there a definite list of all the cute gifs/videos for these doggos/cat?  It appears to be the same cast as -

This has to be the dog that's always posted pulling the cat by the leash, right?
I wanna be this cat
They make a heart.üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
i am the cat -

these my frens here

i like when they

curl up so near

i keep my spot

here on the bed,

they circle round

then hang their head

some cats have kits

at night they hold, 

but me - i'll keep 

my bed of gold


Good god, if that's not the cutest thing I've seen all month...
They look as if they‚Äôve been asked to do a demonstration of it. At the end they all look a bit awkward like they‚Äôre wondering if they can get back to what they were doing before you asked them to show reddit how they sleep. 
Nothing warms my cold, frigid heart like seeing cute dogs and cute cats interacting in friendly ways. Look at them. *Look at them!* They're so goddamn cute! They're friends and they love each other and it's *fucking adorable!*
Further proof that cats run the world.
Is my spot?  Okay is your spot.  I lay here next to claw puppy.

You don't know if they sleep like that every night though OP, if it's just another one of your shitty reposts.
Omg! This is so sweet!
But that ball! it's gotta be jabbing the dog all night long.

I‚Äôm super jealous of that cat. 
That kitty is the only one who knows how lucky he is. Too cute! 
Cat checks his bed before finally laying down like..  "yup, everyone's in the right spot.  Night"

Id take that same spot!
That cat has got it right!

I wish my German Shepard would do this with my kitty. All she wants to do is chase my poor cats around. Even though my damn cat instigates. 
These three pets are the stars of reddit now. They have so much stuff going on every week

Brb off to buy some golden retrievers 
Good owner.. There's a little space heater for the kids
I cried
Right next to that power bill engorging fire hazard.

Chill - I have like 3.
How did you like that heater? I'm thinking about getting the same one. 
For a second I thought the second Goldie was going to accidentally body slam the cat laying down but it perfectly angled itself so they both could get maximum snuggles üòΩ
They‚Äôre the three best friends that anyone could have. They‚Äôre the three best friends that anyone could have....

Thats cute even though i kinda hate cats 
They literally form a heart.
This is the cat that the golden picks up and removes from starting fights!
I can almost hear them saying ‚ÄúRight lads, it‚Äôs sleep time, you know the drill.‚Äù
Cate: "See human?  The Doggos are now also mine, and they provide me with warmth at my whim.  Now go bring me food and drink."
This. Cutest. Thing. Can‚Äôt. Even.
This is what they do on camera and off camera they fight like cat and dogs. 
That cat is SET UP. 
Most definitely a lie. It's rather obvious the dogs are uncomfortable and ordered to lay down.
The fact you add "every night" surely means it s not.  
I guess Human can't stand the truth.

I cannot even handle how adorable and endearing this is....
So funny how they all get into sleep formation!
Heaven is indeed a place on earth.
Dogs are pack animals. They‚Äôre cute too. 
Aren't these the same dogs that broke up a cat fight by picking this cat up by it's harness and carrying it away?
I'm surprised that one on the right can sleep on a ball
Pupper on the right is weighing whether he should get up and move the ball under him
They look like an older couple who just got a kid that doesn't want to sleep by him/herself haha

This is one of the sweetest things I've seen on Reddit in a long time! To be fair, I absolutely love Goldens. 
More videos or it didn't happen! 
And meanwhile I can't even have my cats walk past each other without fighting.

They are sisters though.
They all want a piece of that space heater! Whenever my wife clicks on hers the dog and two cats come sprinting to lay in front of that thing!
So they just sleep every night uncomfortable af?
SWEETEST DAMN THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY
It‚Äôs a heart with a kitty filled center!! 
They kind of make a little heart shape too
This absolutely melts my heart.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen anything cuter. Thanks OP

Oh my! So loving! 
Good. man, you left a heater for them 
I just wanna climb in there

So cute! I'm curious as to Why so many people own Goldies? I'm not complaining, just curious. I see them all the time. Is it some new dog fad or something? Are they over bred? Hmm...
It makes a natural <3 shape! :D
Oh god, my heart.
That is Adorable!!
Lucky cat.
This is a cuddle valley if I've ever seen one... 
My cat kinda does the same, loves going to sleep tucked between my legs near the crouch 
Aww they made a heart shape, what a heart warming scene with the kitty choosing the warmth of friends over the radiator.
Universe is amazing 
I would feel really left out if these were my pets
How can I get in on this?!
Looks uncomfortable sleep for the dogs
Aren't they the trained dogs from the videos where they pull that cat away from a fight? 
Kitty looked right into the cam and smiled three times. As if any confirmation of contentment was needed.
What a beautiful family!

This I think is why Reddit exists. 
I saw someone use this in another post already. I have no problem with reposts, but just thought I would point that out
How do they know when is time to sleep? 
Oh my god. That is TOO much cuteness!!
Can you post more of them doing this everyday
Would make my days 
so like a sack of potatoes!! then?
The cat sits down first.  I love it!

I‚Äôd pay $500 a night to get in on that slumber party.

I want that for me. Is that weird?
Omg, adorable! And love how they form a heart with the cat in the middle, just purrfect!
That‚Äôs very nice to have pets caring for each other (add me!)
What a life that cat has. A great house, food, family who loves him/her and two dog brothers who also ..are her bodyguards?
This makes me want more than one pet

Can I use all my karma to be that cat in my next life?
Looks like a big furry heart. 
There's a space heater like one meter away, of course the animals are going to pile up right there.
This is why I want another dog. My pup is very high energy and we cant always meet his needs. If we got him a buddy and a doggy door to let them roam our backyard and play, he would never look sad ever again 
Is this the cat that always gets dragged out side by the dog?
Lucky kitty! So sweet!
That's too much. I'm pretty sure that video just broke me. The amount of Aww+animals being bros+cute+StopIt!!! Resulted in, what seems to be, a system shut down. It was a good way to go, though. Too bad I never got to se
That dog didn't care that he laid on the ball
Comfy as fuck
the cat's like, "awwww yeeeeeeez"
So these dogs sleep face to face with each other and pretty close to the face of a cat but I always get dog butt?

I just had to put my 12 year old golden down on Thursday. Haven't been able to go to work and pretty much in a constant depression since then. He was truly my best friend and has been with me through everything. I thought watching this would make it worse but it might be the first time I've actually smiled since last week. Thank you.
How do they wake up though?

This is so strange. My mother shared a different video of this same cat and one of the dogs in the same house. I could tell by the collar on the kitty and tiles on the floor.

For the record, the dog grabbed kitty by the scruff of his neck and dragged him along the floor to where he wanted him. Kitty didn't mind.
Turn the heat up! 
Goldens are the best!
i wonder if the cat actually sleeps  
mine are very active overnights,  
it's why i keep my door closed,

Are they sleeping in front of a heater??
Look at how the cat gently moves its tail so the second golden retriever can lay down.
Golden retrievers are gifts to humanity 
I think it's the same pets in that gif where two goldens dragged a cat away! This might get burried but here's the owner's homepage:

https://weibo.com/u/3134961002

There are tons of videos there and she sounds like a lovely person so I hope she gets more traction!
It would be nice if this was real. But these clearly aren't OP's animals given his insane post history. 
The dogs form a heart with the cat in the heart, gawwww
That kitty is loving life.
This is what I wished for. I had a gotten a kitten this summer and then later adopted two rescue mutts who had previously been fine around cats per their fosters.

I had been introducing them to my kitten slowly, and hadn‚Äôt seen any issues apart from them wanting to eat her food. I kept a baby gate up so the kitty had the run of the upper floor, and the dogs had the ground floor, and that had been fine for weeks.

Then last week, I came home from a coworker‚Äôs funeral to find that they‚Äôd randomly decided to bust down the gate. The dogs had gone upstairs and one of them attacked and killed my kitten. 

Now I‚Äôm stuck trying to find a new home for the one that did it, and hoping I‚Äôm not wrong about the one I‚Äôm thinking didn‚Äôt.




Whose dogs and kitty are these? I keep trying to find a source for these videos but it‚Äôs just viral reposts. 
Crazy how animals all sleep together.
Highly suggest 2 twin size memory foam toppers layered on each other. Extra comfy and warm for my doggos and cheaper than I‚Äôve seen some dog beds! Love this
I can‚Äôt wait to get a Golden Retriever. It‚Äôll be my first dog away from my family!

Two big kittens protecting their small pupper sibling. So sweet
This is the greatest thing. 
they make a heart 
I want a web cam of these three streamed every night so I can pretend I'm that comfy. 
I bet it‚Äôs so warm and cozy
Sometimes I hate being human... this is reason number one. Waking up in the morning and leaving for work seeing my dog comfy as hell. Wonder what it‚Äôs like.
My dog will eat my cat, before they will sleep together
Ohhhh - they‚Äôre heartshaped! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Too cute
My mother has a kitten and a dog that was an old stray. The kitten every night would sleep ontop of the dog, reminds me of that, sorta.
So pure. So beautiful
OMG that is just too cute!

Imagine having two gigantic Clifford-sized Goldens so as to experience this at cat-scale

I call bullshit. Those dogs didn't look happy

I sleep with my 2 big dogs (yes am single), and we have a formation we all get into also. One sleeps in between my legs with her nose poking out end of bed and the other sleeps in my arm. By the morning they both have their legs sticking straight into the sky ü•∫. Sometimes the one in my legs gets hot and spreads out and I wake up to a gas-pedal (am a woman). It‚Äôs delightful 
my little heart can't take it. 
Fuck, I want pets so bad. 
Jesus those dogs are fat. 
Your boy just gonna sleep on his tennis ball all night?
R/eyebleach 
Wow... I never thought I'd see something so cute that it would make me puke. Weird flex, but ok.
this will be an interesting breed... radog
The dogs are just proyecting their toy. 
I dunno looks like a trick to me. 
How sad will it be when the first one dies. 
I wonder if they‚Äôre allowed to move
No words. LOVE!
I want this!

Cat be like: ah yes, giant fluffy pillows
Sorry to break up the cutefest but I worry the cat may have some sort of ailment the way those dogs are so protective over it.
Ugh
