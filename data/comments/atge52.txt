Your owl looks weird
What a nice, clean, kitchen look.
Legit what I look like when I am trying to seduce my husband.

Edit: Whoa, glad my sexual awkwardness gave you guys a laugh! Thanks for rare metals, I will show my husband tonight while I try to seduce him *just like Pixar*
"You ah... still working on that novel? Gotta big uh... stack of papers there? Got a nice little story you working on there? Nice little novel? Story brewing there?"
My cat died 8 hours ago and this made me smile and cry, thanks for sharing friend 
The penguin or the cat? :)
The secret is that she’s always silly and you’re just depressed.

I see you like Linux. We are mortal enemies. (Username Relevant)
Love your Tux behind. 

Where did you get it?
Hey. I know things can get rough and wanted to comment anything other than how freaking adorable your cat is, you know that already. Glad to see you are still taking joy in things when you're down! That's some resilience. Sharing your pet's silliness also means you're probably a person who wants to see others smile, and that's a pretty fantastic trait and makes you a caring human. Hope you'll reach out if you find you need it. You deserve care too <3  
r/linuxmasterrace
Rofl. Cats are so dang weird. What a cutie 
THAT SINK THOUGH
HI PIXAR!
My favorite part is that although I’m sure she knows when you are down, shes (i assume) not trying to make you laugh. She’s being completely serious and that’s her “concerned look”. Lol

At least, that’s what I imagine. 
I really think she does. She has the " what wrong" face. Cute.

Your cat is adorable, also I love your kitchen sink and tile. 
What a beaut!
What an amazing name! Haha 
Pixar made me feel better too 😭 ily
Adorable little goofball. My cats do the same thing, sorta. When I'm feeling down, they distract me from my own crap and make me feel better.
So Pixar makes you feel UP when you are down? 
Love wheezy in the background!!!
DRAW ME LIKE ONE OF YOUR FRENCH GIRLS!
This is so adorable and lovely!!! Beautiful cat. 
This just made my morning! 
Turning 30 is enough to get you down. Sending my commiserations Internet brother / sister. It was not fun for me
Linux penguin.
The best 
“Why you sad?”


Don't know your cat personally but I would already give my life for it
How coincidencal that you have a penguin figure that looks like the one from toy story. 
She looks like a puppet with one string left, very cute.
You let your cat watch the grudge didn't you. 
Pixar's Entertainment
Linux penguin
Awww. Such a cutie. Cats are the best. I have my old 13 year old girl and any time I cry she legitimately will sprint towards me, meowing the whole time, grab my hand and lick it, then won’t leave me alone til I stop crying and pet her. 

I’m not sure if she knows I’m sad and wants to help or is like “hey stupid stop making that weird noise, pet me instead! See? Pet the kitty. Shut up, is fine.”

Either way, I love her. 
Not only is this cat cute and the photo good, I also sense someone liking Linux. 
Looks like the head tilt Stewie does 
Thank you for this
That's gross you let your cat on the kitchen counter.
What a nice cat! Pixar is a really cool name btw, and quite fitting if she always tries to make you feel good
Bamboo plants dont like direct sunlight. In any event your plant is in desparate need of grooming. Cute cat 
She dont but its still cool
Good. Pixar usually makes me cry. 
He looks like his ganna ask me where I’ve been
I see that the movie inside out are making a live action cat edition.
Or she could be possessed and feeding off your depression. No? Ok
It looks like Pixar is floating above a sink. 
Hilarious
Good job Pixar!
She looks crazy. 🤣
Draw me like one of your french girls. Thats what kitty was thinking.
what an adorable idiot
I think cats can smell when you’re sad or something, mine always jumps on my lap when I’m sad 
What is going on with that sink? Looks like the cat is floating
Draw me like your french cats.
It’s almost like she’s posing as the Pixar lamp too!
Pixar: Mama what the fuck?
"Remember what you said? I'm all talk, I couldn't possibly go thru with it. I'll just poop and fall asleep."

Can we just acknowledge that this account has one post and it is a Pixar commercial that got to the front page.
What a sexy cat... Meeeeooowwww haha
Tuxedos have so much personality!
She made me laugh and I needed it. Thank you for sharing this. :)
Love the name! 
Press F to pay respect for those who think it is an owl
Ahhh a Linux household, it's nice to see a brother or sister. :P
Anyone else trying to figure out the physics of that sink ?
[We liked your cat](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/AbLV5AT) credit to u/_AI_
Oh, I see. Closer inspection of photo shows birthday candle of 30 years. You're feeling over the hill. Not so. 30 is the new 10.
This started off my day with a smile! Thank you Pixar ♥
You named your cat after a company? 
I'm redoing my kitchen and love that backsplash. Is it tile?
Pixar is a great name for this cat!
As somebody who loves interior design, Nice kitchen!
Cats have the reputation of being pricks and they often are. But I swear, mine knows when I'm bummed out or emotional about something and then will be all nice or affectionate. 
Your cat is ridiculous, tell her I love her. 
"draw me... Like one of your french girls" 
Those sprayhead never last more than a few years.. nice cat
If it goes all the way around, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE!!!

Don't worry that nice Karma will cheer you right back up 
Cute cat, beautiful kitchen!
Are her paws white while her toe beans are black?! 😍
I do like your cat and your toaster and hope you'll feel better soon. 
She looks so adorable, I love her already!
Anybody else see the linux penguin?
I love your Linux penguin
Upvote for Tux in the background. 😁
Is that the Linux penguin?
That's a great name for a cat

I think your cat is broken. Poke belly to reset. 
Love how shes just sitting on the counter in like a pose position lol very cute cat and damn that kitchen looks really nice
"Draw me like one of your French cats... why are you giving me that look?"
100k UPVOTES, never seen no many
That's the most beautiful feline ive ever seen. You're lucky. 
I also love the Linux penguin right behind ❤️
You lucky bastard. She's gorgeous 
what a goddamned stupid name for a cat
Downvoted for the click bait tittle.   

/r/thatHappened/



This picture is so cute, I texted it to my mom who is in the hospital, I’m sure it will cheer her up.
It seem to me that you are doing some yoga pose and this cat is trying to figure out what she has to copy to look cute. 
Pixar? Looks more like that cat from Coraline. 
Lovely cat and perfectly gleaming sink. Well done!
Wheezy is that you?
I wish you would move that toaster away from the sloped sink basin. 
Your sink is amazing too!! 
Great name for a beaver!
Why you sad?
I have the same toaster! 
Or maybe she's always silly and you only notice it when you're down, 🤔 
Our cat seems to really like hearing us laugh, and does seem to encourage it. She actually has great comedic timing, and will squawk out responses to questions.
Clean kitchen and a silly cat. 🐱🐱🐱 
Pixar looks like she belongs in a Pixar film. Cutie!!
Oh my god. She is so freakin amazing and adorable. 

You are so lucky. 

I hope you feel better ❤️❤️❤️
She looks exactly like my cat...they even have white markings in the exact same places. It’s uncanny. 
that is one cool/cute cat.
I have a Pixar look alike (black goatee) https://i.imgur.com/MXexIeS.jpg 
She is so cute! 
So cute 
She's so cute! I hope you'll feel better soon. :) 
OMG! My cat makes the same head tilt face! He’s such a clown! I call this his ‘what you do?’ face. 
My cat is like that, I have fibromyalgia and, though it's a lot better now, when it was really bad my cat Gandalf seemed to know where it hurt & he'd curl up there and purr. A living, vibrating hot pack. Some cats are truly wonderful 
Purfect name
[deleted]
What an adorable cat! 
Like a little god chilling on your kitchen top. Aware that you are both looking at yourselves.
That kitty voodooing you.
Fantastic name. Does she bounce on random letters and then accidentally crushes them?
I always get down too when I have to wash dishes
Now that’s a nice toaster 
Silly Boi!
This looks so much like my old kitchen... weird
If she is down, are you doing something silly to make her laugh too?
The cutest cat I’ve seen! PS I love your kitchen and what is the brand of your toaster?
Linuxxxxx
That sink tho...
No way we have the same toaster!
Why am I terrified 
She’s very animated, I’ll give her that. 
Adorable girl with a great name <3 thanks for sharing her :D I need happy fluffy things today.

Such a cute pose ! I would love to see more silly pictures of her 
Cool pet name

So you're lucky
That's a little creepy.
Don’t know if anyone said this but that is an awesome sink... *thinks to self* .... dang I am old now....
Absolutely love the cat! What a cutie!!
Sorry to derail but do you mind posting pictures of your sink? It's beautiful. 
is that the linux penguin
Well she IS named after something that cheers people up
Nice sink.
Verbal says sup Pixar. http://imgur.com/gallery/L4Y8w
Im really confused by the sink.

The cats feet and legs should be falling into the sink right? Its paw is hovering above the shallow part..its early for me. Why am i awake..
That’s cute and all, but OP send us a pano view of your nice ass kitchen. My Pinterest board will be waiting. 
that's just Linux penguin
Is that Tux I see hanging out in the background?
You've got a friend in her.
So adorable 
“Paint me like one of your french girls?”
I have the toaster too (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞
Did the look come with a "hrrrruuuU" purr too?
Linux
Your cat is defective.  Is it still within its warranty period?  Next time make sure its head is on straight before checking out.

&#x200B;

That is probably one of the cutest poses a cat has ever made.  Tell her to keep up the good work.
10/10 a good boi
Great name!
Turns her head just like the pixar lamp does
Bent Neck Kitty
Pixar is a great name for this goof
Aw! Tux! And a cat! 
You work for Pixar now
“No cats on the counter!!” lol  that’s my everyday speil to my cat lol. But this one looks so cute and innocent I couldn’t yell at her 😂👌🏽👌🏽👌🏽
The penguin looks like wheezy from toy story 2
it's kinda bit creepy but it's still cute
yada yada... titanic reference here.

Lovely cat.
Confirmation bias. She does silly things all the time but the ones that happen when you are down have special meaning to you, so you remember them.
If the cat’s name is Pixar then the penguin in the background must be Wheezy
cLuBpEnGiN?!?
Tell Pixar she needs to stop making so many sequels and get creative again.
My cat would always come in the room when I was feeling depressed no matter where he was in the house. He’s with my roommate now I still see him but I miss having him around all the time. 
Beep
Reminds me of the Pixar lamp
How is this sink working. My brain can’t comprehend it
She’s the [lamp](https://www.google.com/search?q=pixar+lamp&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari#imgrc=3Ld1l5A1H5onjM:) 
 A kind one to love, that's surely one of a kind
My cat in this case jump onto my knees, try to hover me and purr:)))
I had the same toaster. Cool toaster.
What i’m surprised is that you have the Linux Pinguin on your window, why? It has to be next to your computer.
My neck hurts just looking at this....................................
When I'm grumpy my cat shits in the sink because i haven't fed her yet 
Tux!!!
Perfect name for an animated cat.. 
This cat Linux.
Actually, she recognizes that you are vulnerable and takes that time to analyze you for weak spots so she can attack you and take control of the house.
OMG can u pls create an IG account for her! She is a superstar 😻
“Draw me like one of your French girls”
Off the counter Pixar
Oh yeah yeah 
so you like *LINUX*
You run Linux in the kitchen?
Looks like my bathroom 
Am I the only one that’s slightly creeped out by this cat??
I really like your backsplash 
When you are doing something and your roommate clicks a photo:
Watchadoin?
She's is puurfect! 
Cute cat. Try to dissuade her from jumping up on kitchen counters. Stepping on a hot stovetop burner would ruin both your days. (I know training a cat is next to impossible, but a spritz of water might do the trick)
That's gotta be the coolest name for a cat I've ever heard.
Omg I have the same toaster (to the left)
Does she make you cry for the first 10 minutes before making you laugh for an hour? 
I showed my girlfriend and her initial thought was to take the exact same pose.
I put my thing down, flip it and reverse it

She’s making a grocery list in her head for when she eats you.😂
Her expressions look so.. animated. 
I love how casually she is lying on the kitchen sink 😂
Pixar's taking lessons from SHAFT with that head tilt
**WHY DOES IT WANT ME TO PAINT ME TO PAINT IT LIKE ON OF MY FRENCH GIRLS
If I see her like this in the dark, I will shit my pant for sure.
Damn it I love cats!
Thanks for this. 
Fitting name, as that pose is something right out of a Pixar movie

lol
I LOVE that penguin. I need that in my life.
Does she often make live action remakes of old cartoons she made?
Adorable and what a great name ! 
Happy 30th!
She's eccentric.

Dang nice kitchen
I dig the backsplash and sink. Cute cat. I want the sink.
Paint me like a pretty French girl. 
Hey that’s a nice Toaster . I like it 
Your cat looks nothing like a lamp
Oh goodness, your cat looks possessed lol
Derp xD Cats are amazing animals,but also strange.

I have a cat that when someone is arguing she jumps on their lap and sniff the person's mouth.
Hey where'd you get that linux penguin? I need it!
Paint me like your French girls ...
BTW he uses Arch. 
Is this a Linux promo?  The penguin makes me ask lol
Tux =3
Cat: paint me like one of your French girls
"Heyyyyyyyyy"
She looks like she a precious little goofball cute as well
Pixar always knows just how to make me laugh! Unless it makes another movie like Cars 2.
Isn’t that also what the Pixar logo lamp does for Disney?
Cat on the kitchen countertop.   
Gross 

Where can I get one?
Cuteeee 😍😍😍
Is that a little Tux figurine?
I guess a lot of tuxedo cats looks this way? I love when they have the little goatee, I think it's just the most adorable thing ever.
Whoever turned 30 happy birthday 
She's adorable and looks very fun.
Are you ok, OP? 
[removed]
That kitchen would be enough to cheer me up 
I used to be on pain pills bad so I got on a suboxone program. The first 3 days I was getting used to the meds but I was nauseous as fuck so I would lay in my parents bed most the day and my two Italian greyhounds would cuddle up right on my stomach and sleep with me till I felt better. It’s in my post history if anyone cares to watch it. 
Nah she's just judging you
What happened OP, why are you feeling down?
The greatest psychologiist!!!
Ohhh how I love her!!!
So cute!
Petition for op to make a film about their cat to be filmed by Pixar 
My old cat once jumped up onto my shoulders, lay down there and purred like crazy when I was having a really bad shoulder pain and tenseness. It's like she could tell!
Lol why are tuxedo cats so weird?

I love it
+1 for Tux in the background
I wish my brother was like that
Filthy cat in food area.  Sickening. 
I spy Linux! 
Im making the same face trying to figure out that sink!!! Im so confused!!
Sill or disgusting, I cant tell?
She possessed? 
You need to draw her like one of your French girls
Pixar is a great name for a silly loveable cat! 
You’re not alone. That’s the great part
The more cat posts I see on reddit, the more I want one.
Reminds me of an Austin Power pose. 
The RIGHT half of her head looks like a raven. Then the LEFT half of her head looks like a duck. Lol
I love the name.
"Paint me human" 
Get your cat off your counter. Gross.
"Paint me like one of your French cats..."
I need a cat in my life 
Forget the cat, I want the toaster!
Pixar! That's such a cute name!
Her pet penguin looks kind of adorable.
r/whatswrongwithyourcat
It would be a shame if someone were to knock off that plant
I think she is saying "happy 30! Thirties are not scary they are fun!"
That penguin looks disappointed
Clever girl. So warm!
Pixar is trying to see you from your best angle when you feel bad.
Sorry that you are feeling down mate, I'm glad you got a cat that's there to cheer you up. They always seem to know how we're feeling.
can someone look that sub for pet Vogue covers

Awww :) bit of bright to my day 
Aww. So cute!
I have that exact same Tux on my desk at work.
holy shit i want that sink.  
Your cat is broken 
chown trendfoll HighFive.sh
And somehow Pixar knew I was down!

Thanks for the laugh!
She's clearly mocking you.
That’s a pretty kitty!
This is pixar...  Was...  She died 3 years ago...  How is she back?  Wait, why is her head spinning...  Shes floating...  RUN
That's adorable! Also could be the "Linux Nerd Starterpack". /r/starterpacks/.  
That's a pretty awesome cat!
"Hello hoooomaaaann!" said the kitty as it perched on the sink.  
I have the same toaster!
awwww
Funny how your 6 month old account has never posted until today, where you post a funny cat, allegedly named after a major media company. 
 
Just sayin'.
Okay, but where is Disney? 
Man I didn't know people had pet penguins
We don’t deserve animals 
Yeah, Linux always makes me in a better mood.
The Linux penguin is not amused
Awe that's too cute! What a sweetheart 
Reminiscent of that George Costanza pose!!
I have that toaster.

Pretty nice toaster.
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would literally die for pixar
Tux!
Happy 30th! 
Do you think r/catsinsinks would appreciate this? Even if Pixar is technically ON the sink.

Not a cat person but it's filthy how much I want that sink. 🔥🔥🔥
Paint me like one of your French girls
My cats are also weird.
Does Windows support Linux now?
Good kitty. My cat does this whenever my son is upset. 
She is beautiful!
Someone's rich.
The penguin at the back looks like the mascot of Linux
That sink looks awesome. Can I get a full picture without the cat?
Your cat broke.
Hello hooman, look to my pose
Linux user in da house!?
That name!!! 💖
Linux user detected
i think it's broken. still cute though
Tux makes me happy all the time
What makes you think he's not revelling in your misery?
Bet she will be doing the lamp impression soon...Boing!
I think she might be some far owl's cousin lol.
Did she ever jump on an 'I'?
I see a Linux penguin. I approve greatly.
Linux user?
If her head keeps turning I am out of here.
Lame
Coraline
10/10 would buy that cat. So cute
Aww. Why were you feeling down?
OP, is the backsplash tile?? Seriously drooling over the kitchen. Cat is cute, also.
Aaaw. Tux the Linux penguin. 
What a work of art 
TUX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wtf is going on, how is she hovering over your sink?

Edit: Upon further inspection I see it now. I've never seen a recessed counter like that before.
I use arch BTW
soap
Shout out to Tux!
Cool cat.
Awesome kitchen!! 
Got a look of “Do you think this is a fucking game?” 
Tux, is that you hiding in the background? 
What a cutie pie!!!!!💖🐱
Wait, that's illegal
Happy 30th! 
Now photoshop stewie griffin into the picture doing that.
Turn that frown upside down 🐾
Did you know your cat is Skull Kid?
Hi Pixar.  Hi Tux.
Is that the “I think I swallowed my squeaker” penguin from Toy Story? lol 
Easy up vote for cat & Tux.

RIP Club Penquin
You broke her
Hell of a name

wtf that cat needs an exorcism 
Your cat has been watching too many shaft anime [shaft head tilt](https://youtu.be/zpNQd2qsDYE)
Where did you get that tux neeeeed it
It's a cat doing yoga!!! 
It's actually called Tux.
She does seem pretty animated 
This is actually her emergency plan. She knows if you are sad, you might be depressed, if you are depressed you wont feed her, so she makes you laugh! Cats know how to take good care of their personal slaves!
r/whatswrongwithyourcat
Is Pixar levitating above the sink? There's some shadows here that are really throwing me of
What kind of toaster is that? I dig it.
Wow
Hey, it's Tux!
Does she jump over the letter I?
From the cat that constantly brings you "Up"...

That wouldn't happen with Windows
Awesome Pixar! Keep it up!
LoL 😂😻
r/petnamecelebration
Guess you're a fan of their movies--hence the name?
Aw, what a cutie! That head tilt makes me think of the tree spirits from Princess Mononoke.

Also I had a cat who looked just like her named Oreo. 
She’s adorable! I’ve got one like her but she has to stay at my parents, $400 deposit and way too much traffic to feel safe stop me from bringing her over.
Nice tux
Draw me like those French girls
Sounds just like Pixar, when you're heart falls to pieces, the movies always have a happy ending 😂
What a cutie! I am so confused what she’s sitting on? It’s under a faucet and there’s a shadow like it’s a sink... but she’s sitting on it like it’s not??
Draw me as one of those french girls.
Give me your best George Castanza pose...

&#x200B;
What an adorable cat!

 Although... Man... Something about a cat who walks in its litter and uses its paws to hide its pee and poop, being on a clean counter or sink where you prepare food or clean dishes absolutely grosses me out
What a clown! Male version of my Lucky! 
She looks like a complete savage
Tux uwu
It's been 0 days since I've been reminded of the bent neck lady. I guess my 28 year old ass is sleeping with my parents tonight. 😂😂
I see that Wheezy on the windowsill! Pixar indeed!

Cute, but she definitely doesn't know that you are down.
Draw me like one of your french cats
Looks like she’s asking a rhetorical question like, “Do u think it’s funny to make me chase the red dot Karen?”
Sorry you were down mate 
Adorable!! Although, cats on the kitchen counter grosses me out.
How is this cat’s name not Stewie
She even tilts her head like the lamp!
Watcha doin?
She's the bent-neck kitty.
Shes just like the pixar lamp, moving her head at odd angles
I love the wheezy sitting on the windowsill

Love your choice of the name!
Love the Linux penguin 🐧 
While crying hysterically my cat simply turned his head to look at me to express his annoyance with the sound, then went back to his nap. Not all cats can be heroes. 
I can hear your cat
awww...lets turn on the faucet and see how she freaks out now
Hello fellow linux user!
This is a shaft dog. Quality head tilt 
Did anyone mention that cool Tux sitting here? Because I like it. 
Is she your yoga instructor?
You must be a programmer.
Anyone from r/linuxmasterrace?
Please send other silly pics
She's showing you the right way to angle your camera.
She's just waiting to give a toast.  I mean, to eat toast.  That is some toaster!
That sink though!! Cat matches well with the kitchen. 
Is this a cat or an instagram model?
Secret Tux
I spot the linux penguin in the background.
Nice Tux Penguin ;)
Your toaster matches my microwave. Her name is Nostalgia is one sexy appliance.

Cat peoole are an odd and lonely people.
Vet here. Cats do that when they are experiencing acute neck or back pain. Your cat is likely in enormous pain. Based upon the extreme torsion I would surmise she only has a few more days left. Please take her to a veterinarian as soon as possible and enjoy what time you have with her.
Is that the cibc penguin? I used to mascot as that guy

Worst name ever for a cat

I am 100% expecting her to make an appearance in Toy Story 4
