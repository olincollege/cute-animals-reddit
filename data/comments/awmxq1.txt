What if he wants to be an accountant?
Would you rather take this check for one million dollars... Or this dirty old beet?
The goat whisperer
Your son seems a little young to be able to grow a goatee.

If you thought that was baa-d, here's this.
Cept when u gotta tell him part of goat farming is killing the goats
Awww. I want a baby. Goat. I want a baby goat.
I demand this picture be removed, this is waaay too cute to be allowed on the internet!

Seriously freaking adorable! 
I have an irrational fear of goats (seriously why are their eyes like that?) but even I have to admit that this is freakin adorable.
If he is going to be a goat farmer he has to kill lots of the goats he holds dear
[removed]
This looks like it should be a on prayer card. 
Do goat farmers also eat the goats?
I think your son might be a goat 
Oh hell yeah. I want my babies to be murderers too!
Aren’t goat farmers kill the goat?
Cute kid and cute goat...kid will be bald in a couple years tho 
Is it bad that as soon as I saw this I knew exactly what I was gonna see in controversial comments
[removed]
He’ll make a mighty fine Schrute.
Nothing better than completely uninhibited love and innocence.  More of this in the world please.

I don’t know man. I think it would be a better sign if he was trying to kill the goat instead 
Isn't it sad that this picture changes as soon as humans get hungry? I know it sounds weird. Just a thought. Apologies. 
I dunno, looks like they're just kidding around to me.
This is such a sweet, quiet moment
[removed]
Will he be a good Farmer if he gets this close to the animals?  
This is too perfect. Sweet baby goat sleeping peacefully. Your boy’s rosy cheeks and nose. His overalls 😭❤️

One day this will be an adult dude but this sweetness was captured forever. 
Absolutely gorgeous photo 
what heartwarming photo
I love that the title could be about either one of them.
Nothing could make this picture more perfect!
Helped raise goats & sheep for awhile. They are very special animals.
That kid looks like he has a receding hairline. But man what a duo.
[removed]
THOSE CHEEKS
R.i.p that goat hopefully that kid don't turn out a farmer 
Now that's just the cutest goddamn thing ever
This is the purest image I have ever laid my eyes on. 
Beautiful. To think one day your son will be chopping that goat's balls off.
Holy crap!  Too much cuteness.   Too much man.
\*moments after the first goat killed\*
You gotta be kidding me
Like there is going to be farms left when he grows up 
[removed]

The whole "goat farmer" thing is really cool. 

Are humans an easy livestock to keep? 
His flushed cheeks... that’s so cute 
You’re kidding right?!? Lol 
My son’s hair also grew in like my left.
Who'd kidding whom?
What if he wants to be a beet farmer 
https://i.imgur.com/cMtgM57.png
so what happens to the goats when they die?
Ima just say what if my guy wants to not be a goat farmer
Ohh~ my heart!! so cute!
Please post videos in a few weeks of that goat ramming the shit out of your child and knocking him off his feet. Thank you. 
Do you kill the goats for meat???
THAT BOY IS A SHRUTE
Making a Murderer: Infant Edition 
Does he need to name that goat to then kill it in a couple years?
I wish I’m ever as comfortable as that goat
You've gotta be kidding me! 
[removed]
Which one is your son
Both adorable, love how the goat is so chilled their eyes are closed. Toddlers that age can be full of energy and pull at anything. Fair play that your little guy is so still.  I love little boys in dungarees, i used to put my children into them all the time, just so cute.

Black Phillip! Black Phillip! 
Name that goat Tom 
I think he might want to sell paper. 
u/evandroemir 
He’ll be a beet farmer 
This kid is going to be the absolute GOAT when he's older.
Its all about the love you captured. Great Kodak moment!😊❤
He’s not just gonna be great, he’s gonna be the GOAT!

I’ll see myself out.
Maybe he doesn’t want to be a farmer.
This melted my stone cold heart 😭😭😭
What's a "kidding season"? A time to joke all you want?
The G.O.A.T of goats. His name, Billy.
I grew up on a goat farm and now live in a city where the idea of keeping goats is laughable. This affected me a lot.
Two good boys
You’ve goat to be kidding me!!! He’ll sheerly be fantastic.
I'm a goat farmer mother fucker!!
Or love the simulator :)

Kid, meet kid. Kid, meet kid. 
Your son appears to be suffering from early onset male pattern baldness. I recommend Propecia. There are also several shampoo products designed to treat thinning hair.
Are we all gonna ignore the fact that this kids gonna kill that goat for a living. Not saying that’s a bad thing but still, he shouldn’t get too attached.
Weird looking dog
Not just a great goat farmer, he's going to be the GOAT
This is such an adorable photo
The most adorable thing I've ever seen
I'm sure he'll be reeeeeal good at sending them to slaughter too 
That, or maybe he wants to be something else? Hopefully you'll support their decision if/when the time comes. 
This picture kicked me right in the uterus. 
Noooo don't exploit the cute goats D=
He does not look like someone who would exploit and kill goats actually. 
I don't think he will be happy when the time comes to kill them
Good ol' passive forcing your kids to do what you did. Jk but not really lol

 I'm sure your great parents. Being a farmer takes another level of dedication and discipline 
This must be Philip Schrute. 
Usually i find kids gross but this is adorable. 
That is indeed a schrute 
Is he serious, or is he only kidding?

I regret nothing
I’m dying of cute!!! 🥰
Pleae please please let him be around normal kids, he will hate life later if he is a goat boy and thats his reputation 
The GOAT goat farmer!
You are just skipping CRISPR altogether huh? http://prntscr.com/msh1dn

And I thought babies and puppies were the best combo...
I'm glad no one was around to hear the noises I just made.
Holy crap that's cute
This is calendar worthy. Please frame it!
This is too much cute. Far exceeding the normal limit. Cute kid man. 
His little overalls! The cuteness is too much. Such a sweet picture.
This melts my heart. Adorable!!! I too believe he will be a great goat farmer!!!

Oh my god.
Adorable !
Stooooooooooooooooooppp it.

I wonder if the way a baby's hair grows in is any indicator of how the grown man may lose his hair
Can we get a goat farmer AMA?
That's adorable, not even kidding.
This is beyond cute...
Buslim
Oh my GOD I'm DEAD his lil chubby cheeks I wanna cry 
Priceless, very sweet!

That's adorable!! Our farm just started the kidding season, but we don't have any little humans, so we have to make due with a crazy amount of kids.
Guys it Dwight when he was younger!

My family has had to raise one of our baby goats since he was born and hes so cute, goats are great
😍😍😍
That goat has a better hair style than I do.
If he doesn't end up a good goat farmer, theres always Beet farming.
Dad's hair
I helped last year on my aunts farm for a couple weeks. I loved the animals and miss it so much. Great parenting. 
This kid is the goat god
AKA A shepherd
A whole season just for making jokes? Wow. 
Couple of cute kids!
Little on has a grinch smile. Quick! Teach him the value of Christmas while there is time!
I need to find a goat and have my 18 month old snuggle it! Omg goats and babies 🥰😍
cute kid 
Should raise him to be a Beet Farmer.
No way, you're kidding!
It ain't much but it's honest work.
"But I don't want to farm goats father, I want to dance!"
I have to deal with sheep. I want goats so bad.
The smile of a goat that won't live long.
Farmer? More likely he'll just fuck a goat 
That is a cute picture. Something divine about it. 
I mean that sounds cool and all, but is he just kidding?
You’ve got to be kidding. That kid’s a kidder and I’m not kidding. Seriously, I’m not a kidder in the matter of kids and kids.
He will be a great goat farmer, No Kidding!
This should be a Christmas card! 👨‍🌾🎅
Cherish them while they are young, before you know it it will be his first adulting season. 
No kidding! 
So precious 
You're not kidding, are you?
Atta boy 
Aww
Would you say he'll be the Greatest Of All Time? 
Both babies look so content. 
Are you kidding me!?
This is the most precious picture!
I thought kidding season started on April first. 
You win the internet today.
So sweet
This is one of the cutest baby photos I've ever seen!
You've got to be kidding me.
You should have someone draw or paint this for you!
Babies know other babies!

Goats are filthy
This is a beautiful 💝 Sweet photo! 
Just kidding am I right guys? 
He won’t be a goat farmer. Wait, who am I kidding, he goatally is.
Omg. Award winning pic right there. 
Isn't April 1st traditionally the beginning of the kidding season?
This needs to blown up framed, so sweet. 
Awwwwwww
I had a Muslim friend who owned goats. He’s in jail now
Ok this is epic 
I think it's his first anything season.
You're kidding me
Wouldn't he be a "goat rancher"?
As a worm rancher I think that anyone who raises noble animals should be referred to as a rancher 
Hugs :)
TOO PRECIOUS
Goals??
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen
That is precious!
Ewe gotta be kidding me!
I though that wasn't until April 1st
Get this framed, OP! 🥰
This photos is so sweet and good. This made my terrible day at work a little brighter. Thank you. 
A baby Shrute

Heads up for the little guy👍
You have a lot of kids on your hand
No kidding?
MY HEART
YeeAWW if you know what I mean
No kidding dude
No goats no glory
Kidding season. I thought you meant like since April fools day is coming up it’s “kidding” season. Yeah I thought you were the ultimate family of practical jokers or something preparing your newborn for his first pranking season. It wasn’t until I saw the pic that I realized that i unfortunately have not found my long lost family.
What’s wrong with your son’s (the human) cheeks?
This is some game of thrones level stuff. 
Too pure 
Beautiful 
That boy is a shrout 
You must be kidding
!Remind me 18 years
You must be joking, or some might say you're just kidding.

The kids are alright.

Jk. Lol
I grew up on a Toggenburg dairy, wouldn't trade it for the world.
My in-laws have a goat farm. It kind of always seems to be kidding season. There are always babies. They have a hundred head or so and a mess of cows too.

Farming is hard. Hats off to you.
Don't let him push them to the edge, they push back

Man I want some goats. Got horses, chickens, a Turkey who just showed up 4 days ago and has made a home with us, dogs and cats. Goats are my wish list animal. Gf wants alpacas but I say goats to help with the overgrowth in the summertime months.
What if he wants to eat it?
This picture cured my depression 
That hairline. Ouch. 
JUST KIDDING
Soooooo adorable!!!!! 💗
Around this time. Does anyone make jokes and then say “Hey, just kidding.”?
So, as you were placing them there and forcing their heads together, was there a crack? Are they both still alive?
Are you kidding??

Just kidding
You have got to be kidding! 
Are you assuming his career path?
Goats are the best
With the dark cool tones of his outfit, I'd say the season is Autumn. Haha just kidding
My heart just exploded
So cute
Lol. I think your kid looks like hoof stock that is trying to molest that innocent human.
Kidding season? You forgot to post all his jokes, OP !
This is the most adorable photo I've ever seen!

You know I've always wondered is it possible to get a job on a farm like a farm hand, or ranch hand full time?
Awww look at this cute lil guy just kidding.

Anime baby? Why are lil babies cheeks so red?

Please tell me you raise dairy goats. He is too cute for his little heart to break.

He’s a true Schrute 
This needs to be framed. 
Cute picture. I might be a criminal, but am I the only one that wants to photo shop that shiny blade of grass? It's distracting me. 😅
God I wish that were me
That is such a sweet picture.
It’s late here. House is quiet. I just said “Oh my God! Ohhhh!” Out loud. Now my dog Murphy just wandered in with sleepy eyes to see what was up. Thank you for upsetting my world with unadulterated purity. ♥️ 
This is so precious and so pure.
Omg those cheeks are soooo pinchable. 
I really like goats. My family used to own a goat, back when I was about 7 or 8. Her name was Nellie and I remember me and her kidding around in the backyard, mainly me running and her running over to me sometimes. One time we had the backdoor open and we were just about to sit down for dinner when ol Nellie hopped onto the table. I loved that goat.

Who tf wants to be a goat farmer
He’s goat this 
I’m going to use that photo on my Christmas cards. 
This is so freaking cute.

I love everything about this post
Baby fever!! 
Heart eyes all the way 😍
This speaks volumes. ❤❤
Ahhhhhhhhhh! Cute overload! 
What if he don’t wanna be a *great goat farmer*?
Is his name Dwight?
That’s a great kid.
Wow, no kidding
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen 
This kids the goat!
I love baby goats.  Do you farm them for milk or meat? 
Hey! Nice kid. 
He’s a lucky kid! (I’ll see myself out)

But in all seriousness, I wish I was born into a farming family. It honestly seems like the best job ever and I’d love to own acres and acres of land 
Why does this look like a picture of Dwight & Angela’s baby that would be hanging up in their farm house? 
This is the kind of picture stock photo companies put on Christmas ornaments. 
I feel for you. No need to be sorry for your own opinion.
Omg the cheeeekkkssss!!!
There’s something about this photo that I really love. 
The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking? 

Of course I am not interested in goats. Why would you spend so much time going over the goats with me? 
Time to take the G.O.A.T exam.
I super approve! That's a happy goat!
Show him the same photo and the posted comments when he is a teenager, am sure he will lol
Just two kids hanging out!
Sooooooooooo cute!!! Wow incredible!
So cute 
Our boys looks kinda similar.. minus the goat!
I really hope you’re kidding 
what if he wants to be an astronaut?
♥️♥️♥️♥️
This picture is so sweet it's making my teeth hurt.
Y’all. You WANT farmers that love their animals, even the animals raised for meat production. We can’t stop everyone from eating meat, but we can encourage people to source from ethical farms that do their best to raise healthy, happy animals. You might not like it, but that’s the reality of the situation.
I’m not sure which one is cuter???
Simply a precious picture. 😊❤️
Or lover....

Aww! I bet he has some great shows at the fair through the years!

I am not too up on current Goat fashion but...

It is really cute that they are both wearing matching Denim.

My paw ever said a thing like that about me, he'd be missing teeth.
Is hair like this indication for male pattern baldness in future?
That is the most purest photo on the web period
Just kidding. 
Wish I could upvote this more than once 😍😍😍😍
ITT: vegans
He won't be. First, farming isn't a viable profession in a modern world anyway.  Second, kids disappoint parents no matter what.
