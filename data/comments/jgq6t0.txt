CEILING CAT IS BACK! EARLY 2000S MEMES ARE RELEVANT AGAIN! ALL YOUR BASE IS LONG!
Having worked in drop ceilings I would not trust allowing cats to roam free up there

Cat1: "My god that man's fat. I don't think I've ever seen a fatter man"

Cat2: "And look at her, that must be his wife"

Cat1: "You know I do believe he's wearing a wig, it's such an obvious one. How could his wife let him go out like that.

Cat2: "Hmm, and what an ugly child"
How has no one called this the Cattic yet?

I did a job at a wastewater treatment facility south of Sacramento and the boss lady there opened the drop ceiling for cats and even built a little ladder they could use to get up and down. There were seriously more than ten cats down with us, I have no idea how many there were up above.

The whole time I'm making changes to the control system, I'm smelling the rank unmistakable odor of cat piss along with being swarmed with flies. Working at wastewater plants is never a picnic, but this one took the cake.
Okay, but I’m too scared to look up and see something that’s not a cat staring at me from above
Fuckin Micromanagers.

i love this so much 😭
“Hmm... while his technique is great, his cutting form is a little sloppy. What do you think?” “Well, he could certainly use a lesson or two from us.” *snarky laughter among cats*
it's like a ceiling fresco, if michaelangelo was into cats
When we were remodeling our bathroom we didn't have a ceiling.  My cat would get up in the attic and watch people on the toilet in the ceilingless bathroom.
Clearly he needs constant su-purr-vision.
Ah yes, the cattic.
So its now a cattic.
My boys would love something like this. I imagine they built some sort of tunnel system that is better mounted than a drop ceiling, because there is no way a regular drop ceiling could take the weight of a cat.
Imagine having visitors that will sleep in this house without knowing there are cats on the roof. They will have a fun time sleeping at night~
Ceiling Cat saw dat it wuz gud.
Why aren't all of the comments about Ceiling Cat?!
Its all fun and games til something else starts looking down that ceiling
“May I speak to the manager!?”

“Of course, my supervisors are right here” *motions to ceiling cats*

Funny!! 🤣
This is the dream.
First time i laughed out loud and snorted lol. This ticked me more than it probably should have XD
The only kind of "smoosh, smoosh" I approve of: look at that squished fur and beans.
Cute. I wonder how many gallons of cat urine those ceiling tiles can absorb
If you cats walking directly on your drop ceiling, you are going to have a bad time.
Ceiling cat is comfy, has buddy
2020 bringing back the og memes
Honestly most cats would probably love this arrangement. They are up high, have great view of movement around them but from a safe vantage point and they don't have to interact with their pet humans unless they want too.

Add a mod to Skyrim with new ceiling cats so you can no longer steal from the shops!
Op missed saying that the owner was under "constant suPURRvision"

This is 100% a photoshop battle waiting to happen.

Can I pay a home renovator to do this for me?
If I ever open my own shop, I'm doing exactly this
This is how it starts...one simple modification...next you’re investing in little tiny goggles, lab coats, and clipboards.
I was looking at this for a good 20 seconds before I realized it wasn’t a video of cats just being really still.
Ceiling Cat is amused by your shenanigans.
I like how their feet squish into their bellies.
Look at them, puny humans. One day brother one day they will be OUR pets and we... Will rule

If I saw that when I would look up I would be scared everyday
Even knowing I had cats up there, I would just keep thinking I have rats in my ceiling

I was just talking about the Office episode with cats in the ceiling.

This is everything
Customer : ...whats that??


Owner : That's just my Cattic...



I'll leave...
It is fun until you have to clean cat puke from the middle of that glass.
Cats are like,"I am meowing you . Don't do anything MEOW".....
Nice

All hail the ceiling cat
They’re definitely pretending to smoosh him with their paws.

That is some serious fluff squish!

Well. This is stuff that starts nightmares for people.
Lets hope the other tiles in that suspended ceiling don't ever collapse under the cats' weight.

More like pawservation right?
Cat TV
Best idea ever!
Cat in the ceiling, eh? Okay, now you're talking my language!
The title should read “a shop owner finds dead cats in ceiling because this idiot has random wires all about and thinks he’s accommodating his cats” 

Something along those lines.

This isn’t aww so much as animal mistreatment. 

T-bar drop ceilings have sharp edges,pointy wire hangers,electrical,plumbing,debris and dust all of which is potentially harming these cats.
The one on the right is proper observing, look at the little paw on their chin
Something about looking at the underneath of cats is very cursed. 

They just look so *flat*
Praise be

Lol how did they not call it a ‘Cattic’
>A shop owner modified his attic to accommodate his cats. Now he is under constant ~~observation~~ judgement.
Finally 2020 brings it's first true success. A REAL ceiling cat(s)!
HAHAHA! This is crazy cool! Very hilarious!
Your title feel's like a "Steven King meets Cats & Dogs" scenario.
Ahhh squishy cat bellies!!!!
idk ginger and tabby lookin kinda sus
Growing up all three cats would go up in the drop ceiling. Until I was about 14 then they stopped. Not the same cats from that point on. The originals died, but it’s crazy to me that none of my parents cats after that and there have been about 10, have spent any amount of time up there so that at least it’s noticeable.
Owaw
That's pretty funny. Nice
Imagine going to a shop to buy chips or something but when you look up these chonkers are staring back at you.
CATTIC!

Yeah really cute while it's the fluffy kitties looking down on ya. Look up there and see a human face one day and you'll shit your pants.

That's..... Not an attic. That's called a drop ceiling. It's a basically a fake ceiling to hide commercial building systems.
So much masturbation to watch!
One day he will look up and see the face of a little girl that died in that house many years ago and he will regret that decision
Kitty done squish

Tell me he now calls it his Cattic otherwise I can’t be his friend.
Those cats are going to find a new place to shit and never leave but for food.

All fun and games until it’s not a cat that’s looking down from there
Those are actually cameras
If you have a tile ceiling I highly recommend showing your cats how to get up there. Since my cats have passed on I’ve had to stick so many fuckin mouse traps in the ceiling and have woken up to them so many times.
I suddenly feel ashamed...
where can i get one
Who needs a security system am I right?
That’s terrifying actually lmao
I went into a house that had cats above the drop ceiling.  Smelled like piss and shit throughout the whole house.....

All is fun and games until your cat poops in the attic.
Awesome idea. Overlords being overlords.
Wait, so, his cats love in the attic?
That's....that's terrifying.  I'm on a laptop probably thousands of kilometres from this, and I'm feeling personally judged.
Cat: 1 he looks like such a peasant down there.

Cat 2: they’re all uncoordinated peasants
IF IT FITS HE SITS
Loss prevention in the year 3020.
So...to bring up an ancient question addressed here on Reddit many years ago...does the cat's anus touch the glass when it sits? I don't think we ever got a definitive answer.
Observation? More like supervision.
I'm fucking dead
At first I thought this was a painting .
"attic"?! Bro, that's a suspended ceiling. Why the fuck is he shoving cats up in a place filled with cables, dust, insolation and all sorts
I like how this is a screenshot when 99% of the time you can just save the image directly.
My little girl just nearly started crying at how cute this is.
Then yelled out "CEILING CAT"
“Ah yes, my new security cameras have been installed” 
“Why are they meowing”
Under constant supervision, not observation.
Good luck cleaning all that cat hair out of there.
what are you doing there? 😅
I love it!!!
You just know one of them (or both) are gonna take a dump right there.

He should do that with the floor so the children in the basement can watch as well
What a GREAT idea!
Cats do love to look down on people. In return they are offering a look at their r/curledfeetsies.
Haha now you fucked up shop owner, i shall now spy far away from above
Clever
I feel like this image shows two types of house cats. The “tucked in” cat where all arms and legs are underneath. Then there’s the “half n’ half” like the one on the left which is what my cat does. I assume she’s too chunky to lay on her back legs so she just kicks them out to the side.
It looks purrfectly splendid. 
In all seriousness though, I’d be kinda scared to look up at night outa fear that something other than a cat looks back at me.
I love this
thanks I love it :)
Their legs look so flat XD
Attic?? Does dude live in a 1 story basement? Who would have drop ceiling for an attic

Happy cake day ceiling cats
But why would anyone allow vermin to roam around in their ceiling?
I hate this go fuck yourselves
It will look so much cuter when the cat piss puddles soak thru the tiles. That shop owner is a real genius! As is the person thinking that the ceiling space is an attic. All together now ...aww!
Cats are so ugly and gross
