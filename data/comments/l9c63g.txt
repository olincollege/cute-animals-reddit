My dog is 8, and 80lbs. She still acts like this, and is the primary reason i can't do any sort of exercising at home.
The pup is keeping the sweat out of the human's eyes. Cutest gym towel ever!
If my gym had spotters like this, I‚Äôd work out all day every day.
He's doing his best  to help.
So many motivational kisses!
Play with me! Play with me! Play with me!
I have 2 golden doggos. They are constitutionally incapable of leaving me alone while I work out. Yoga? Borderline aggressive kisses. Aerobics? Time to dance, hold my paws. Weight lifting? Gimme the chew toys (weights). 

Workout time is now crate time.
Is that Chris Harrison?
The puppy is so cute he forgot to put the weights on
That is Spot. He got a Spot. Spot is the best. Spot helps. Spot motivates! Spot is a dog!
This video was too cute, u/TurdsforNipples
CUTENESS OVERLOAD
*panting intensifies*
Is it just me or are his wrists flexed too much? It looks like if he put weights on he would damage himself. I'm new to lifting* so I want to make sure I know good form lol

Edit: to be clear, I'm not trying to criticize, I'm just trying to learn here.
You guys had Spot the Dog kids books too? Little bit of childhood I'd forgotten about there
"Oh my golly! I'm so glad your face is finally at my level!" I think is what every puppy dog thinks when your head gets closer to the ground.
Finally, a motivator to get that 24/7 grind on :)
Good Boi is giving the best emotional support
So many helpful little kisses
See Spot spot. 

Go Spot, go!
No, that's exactly what they meant
you can tell this guy has never benched before in his life.
I always love coming to the comment section when this video gets posted, you can always spot the people who have never worked out a day in their life.
Yoga = you mean we are going to snuggle every time I change a pose near the ground.   Lol
I‚Äôm helping :)
There are few things in life better than a puppy excited over your existence.
My man has wrist problems, or, will.
Oh Dad! Are you ok? Can you get up? I'll stay with you and lick you until you are able to get upright! I love you Dad!!!

LOL
clearly success

Adorable puppy attacks a young Bryan Cranston in a gym. Wholesome.
Props for proper warmup. Bars heavy man.
"Is this enough help?"

"Maybe too much"

"I will help more!"
Straighten those wrists out!
If my gym had him I would be there everyday or not working out and playing with him
Puppers
Best personal trainer ever

Golden retriever puppies are the cutest puppies.
DON'T change my view.
What a cute doge
This is too cute
10/10 he's getting that spot alright!
He might want to try some outdoor cardio when the dog is old enough lol.
10/10 best spotter. I‚Äôd workout more if I had said spotter
u/SaveVideo
the ONLY emotional support you ever need
Well, some guys do work out just to get bitches
The only spotter you'd need
Yeah
Maybe it's just the trainer in me but I'm honestly impressed by his correct shoulder placement during this (*distracting*) set üòÖ
How do I hire this excellent trainer?
Looks like we got something in common, I like having my face licked while exercising too
Oh my god that is adorable, there should be more dogs at gyms!!
Awww I love your spotter.ü§£
Come on hooman I‚Äôll spot youüòÅ
I want to cry
I‚Äôd make gainz all day
This is the cutest shit in the world
There‚Äôs just no normal exercising with dogsüòÇ

Ok this is super Awww-worthy but I‚Äôm commenting and upvoting because of OP‚Äôs user name. Genuine lol there!!!
I have some concerns for this man‚Äôs wrists when he starts loading up that bar üòß
My dog does this. A little less cute when he‚Äôs 60+ lbs and is all bone and muscle (Dobermans man). Still love it tho
Goldens are so damn cute.
"I just love you so much and I know you can't cover your face right now".
I would definitely go to that gym
How much is a membership to this gym üò≠
I did a fitness class with my school when I was 12. The instructor would bring her grown-ass German shepherd in all the time. When we did weight-lifting, her dog did something like this.

Edit: here‚Äôs a picture. Face blurred out is a friend who didn‚Äôt want their face posted https://imgur.com/gallery/vtEUZYT
Goldens are just the biggest lovebugs!
Altogether now: We Do Not Deserve Dogs.

My cat does this every time I'm doing bench lol üòÜ
I‚Äôve tried doing Pilates with my mastiffs around and instead I ended up getting kisses
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what they meant by ‚Äúlifting weights‚Äù either.
Dude, don‚Äôt lift when you‚Äôre making out with your dog...
‚Äúwhat are you waiting for throw me the stick roger‚Äù
That‚Äôs what I mean when I need a spot.
Hilarious and cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
Choking your enemies is a good way to get rid of them since your size doesn‚Äôt matter
I really want to pet it through my screen
Guy needs to fix his wrists
u/savevideo
If this were commonplace in gyms, I think we'd be seeing a lot healthier people
Looking at the missing weights like "do you even lift, bro?"
When I do pull-ups my boy remi puts his paws on my back and pushes I can't tell if he's trying to help me go up or be extra resistance. Either way thanks buddy
Rip wrists
Anybody notice he doesn‚Äôt have any weights
He's just telling you that you forgot the actual weights...
I wish I was a physically fit rich older white man with a decked out home gym and golden retriever puppies.
Carry on like that and he's gonna be needing new wrists....
The dog was added to the video. He‚Äôs really just struggling with the bar.
r/PetsinGyms
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY MEANT!
Can we get some respect for this dude feeling confident lifting only the bar in his public gym? Hats off man. We all gotta start somewhere.
No the dog is actually taking place of a face mask, it‚Äôs the new thing lol
Like in the corner of a boxing ring where they put water on your head to cool you down, he licking him ü•∫
Awe so cute ‚ò∫Ô∏è
The focus to keep going, lolz
He's helping!
Doggos are awesome-sauce!!!!
"You're doing great! I love you! Come on put it up! I love you! One more, one more! I love you! Get that PR! I. Love. You."
Got to love em
See Spot. See Spot spot!
Musk
"ALL YOU! ALL YOU!! YOU GOT THIS!!"
It's not like you really need to breathe while exercising.
My dog does this too. Like if she gets to excited she‚Äôll wag her tail so much that her whole body moves and she‚Äôll rub her neck against someone‚Äôs face
He looks like a young Walter White
Cute
Best kind of workout
But this works too, I guess
u/vredditshare
Puppy!! Goldens are so cute.
Aww cutest thing ever. What kinda dog is the?
Golden retriever or lab?

So noiceeee
Puppy love.
Wow man you got into shape since the last time i saw you.

Well yea...I got a personal trainer.

My personal trainer:...
Spots got you.
The best motivational support.
He‚Äôs the sweat cleaner.  We don‚Äôt use towels in this gym
Aww I swear this made my day üòçüòçüòç
Love love love
Does anyone have the contact details for this personal trainer? This is the kind of motivation I need.
u/savevideo
Awww

Too cute I want 1
Sure, it‚Äôs not what was intended but it is an awesome loophole.
Is that Bryan Cranston?
dog: I am more important than exercise.
Aww babies
Love that puppy face.
This is fake! The puppy isn't excitedly peeing everywhere? I don't believe it.
The face of a man who wants to smile and laugh but is also afraid of getting a french kiss from the dog.
Let's talk about that bat path though
Need to work on that bark path.
At least his posture is correct
This is pretty much how I work out.
"You're doing great. One last set and then treats."
Who brings a puppy to the gym?
Best couch i ever seen
What a great workout buddy, the best boi ever!
Never have to worry about the bar
What a good boi. He is licking the sweat off his face
Well, they could've just asked me to put a price? I mean I can't imagine that would be too hard, right?
üòª
So cute ü§ó
The real workout is the mental workout of seeing how long you can resist the urge to pet
Looks like this friendship will work out

For those that don't know. The guy in this video is MMA fighter Matt Hughes. He went through a pretty horrible car accident in 2017. Leaving him with  "severe, progressive and permanent brain and bodily injuries.‚Äù.  I believe that this is his comeback after the accident. Truly inspiring.

So wholesome. Thank you turdsfornipples
Idk what it is about dogs needing to smother you when you are lying down or low enough to get tongue attacks.
‚ÄúIm helpin‚Äô!! Yew can dew eeet!!!‚Äù
Ahhhhh.....the BEST workout ever!
Is that Robin Williams?
r/dogsfreakout
I don't see any problems with this.
Free sweat towel. Nice.
The dog is trying to stop him because his wrist position is dangerous, wrist should be under the bar. Spot is trying to prevent a horrible lifting injury.

Spot is a good boy.
A good doge spotting for his bestest best friend. Good boys all around
Human is working out
Commence mlemmer mode
I have nothing to back this up, but I swear pets can tell if humans are in distress and tries to calm them down.
My dog growing up was definitely like this. My cat now gets mad at push-ups. Without any claws he will come bat me in the face or yell at me. It is pretty funny. Also whatever foam my yoga block is made out of he wants to chew on. I have to keep it locked away when not in use.
u/savevideo
Yes, yes, the well known "assistance dog" in training.
He‚Äôs saying ‚Äúdad you‚Äôve been lifting the bar for 6 months now, time to move on‚Äù
Bent wrist, bar path isnt straight. The doge should coach instead 2/10 start over.
love this
OMG I WANT ONE
Wdym of course it is
Thats a gym id love to be at. Perfect pup ü§ó‚ù§
My dog tries to save me from the treadmill every time I get on it. He really is my best friendü§£ü§£
He's trying to tell you to straighten your damn wrists
Puppies grow up too damn fast.  Like 2 months they are almost adults
See spot spot
Now thats a spotter
It‚Äôs even funnier since it seems like he knew the dog would do this since he‚Äôs just using a bat
Aww.. my heart melts seeing this cute pup!

Not to be one of those guys, but yeah. Actually I am to protect your joints. Keep your wrists straight and move the bar more in the direction of your head while pushing. Little advise.
Are you kidding, this is the only spot I want
The power of a good title on a good post
I spot u humoon
I love how dogs see you on or near the floor and they think, ‚ÄúNow‚Äôs my chance!‚Äù And are all over you. Dog owners: spend more time on the floor.
I wish i was that guy
"Yo dog, will you spot me?"
100% benevolence

Crappy bench form buddy should arc the bar closer to his face

the awww spot > the gee spot
I shouldn't watch these posts were people can go to the gym :/
Also there is not even any weights on.

No one going to comment how this guy‚Äôs gonna hurt his wrists with that form?
Talk about ‚Äúlove.‚Äù
It makes it even better that this is Chris harrison, one the most wholesome humans on tv
Lift the dog, problem solved :p
My cat's name is Spot! I love my cat so much :)
My 70 pound golden doodle gives me a kiss every time I come up from a sit up
That's the kind of gym motivation I need.
This is wholesome
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs
See spot not spot. Spot spot, spot.
Pupper knows his ABCs--Airway, Breathing, Circulation. Good Nurse.
I cam find no fault in this doggo's spotting.
Brady is going all out prepping for the superbowl
Dogs are just furry babies. They deserve all the love
Awww, what a cute puppy! He‚Äôs just doing what any puppy would do. :)
I think there‚Äôs something on your face let me get it...
Puppies smell good so that's probably actually relaxing his muscles.  Working out never was more fun.
Doggo is trainer and giving licks as motivation
Is there a better way to work out? The world may never know.
I wanna go to the gym
I love dogs so damn much
I just had to say I like the guys form.
He's so cute!
Lots of encouragement there:))
So cute!
That's obviously what they meant
Does the bar weight 10 lbs?
That's the only Spot you would need when you're only benching the bar.
What kind of dog is this?
Chris Harrison?
This is the dude that tries to hog the bench press/squat for an hour and a half.
Weak wrist position. Careful, you'll end up with wrist pain like me!
Best kind of workout buddy. You'll move your ass when getting slobbered on like that.
What a beautiful post u/TurdsforNipples
u/vredditshare
He's telling you to straighten your wrists!

The man is red-struggling with that bar because of this dog
Yeah, you should be able to just buy a spot on the website.
Great title
There's reminds me of that scene in the gym in New Girl.
Ah, that's sweet - the puppy is helping with the workout ...
It's exercise prevention day!
AAAAAHHHHHHH DON'T BEND THOSE WRISTS!

Why is there a dog in a gym?
I will take that spot and up the game to belly rubs!
We don‚Äôt deserve their love!!!
I need this kind of spotter.
Best gym ever!!
See Spot spot. Spot Spot, spot.
Cutest spotter ever. +10 motivation. -8 endurance.
Is it named SPOT?!?!?
God I hope that dog is covid vaccinated!
You press that bar üòçü§£‚ù§Ô∏è love it
ugh that bar path is horrendous. It's a good thing he has the doggo spotting him
He thought it was a Game
Aww this just hit me with nostalgia. I remember reading Spot the dog.
He‚Äôs his coach
u/savevideo
And thats just the warm up. Think about when theres weight on the bar.
u/savevideo
Man, that is so darn cute, he is so lovely. I wish I had a dog like him.
He‚Äôs so encouraging!
That‚Äôs not a Spot.
I'm trying to get fit my self. I would love to have a personal trainer like this
Is that JOHN CEENNNAA? Haha
Let him have this, he thinks he‚Äôs helping!

Lifting 20kg bar xD
You should not bend your wrists

I would pay good money for this type of treatment at the gym. Honestly it might be the only thing that would get me to the gym.

Wonderful
10/10 puppy. 1/10 form.
Worst spotter ever.

But definitely the cutest spotter ever.
This is the strongest man alive
You gotta fix your wrists mate. They‚Äôre not looking to be in good position for benching in the long term
" I'm a pup , i shake my tail

  I bring snuggles , licks and mail

  Help my friend to practice more

  And we later run on shore . 




  Brings the kite , i always like

  It's a butterfly " So high !!  "

  Always gives me string to keep

  I believe my master's LIT !  "
Thats the best personal trainer I've ever seen.
That dog needs to tell him to straighten out his wrists.
Looks like a younger Bryan Cranston
Gee little mate I can't breath if you rest on my nose, okay, I'll just lick the sweat of your face.
You have such a great workout coach. So motivating and encouraging
Maybe the name of the doggo is spot!
I have a question, how heavy is that pole he is (lifting?)?
u/savevideo
Look at all that weight he's got on there.
Put him on the treadmill so we can See Spot Run
good thing he's only lifting the bar, which you'd have to drop at the top to have a chance of doing any damage
(Frantically searches for this gym)
I'd be buff asf if I could work out at a gym like that.
Too adorable
And his name is John cena
Huh. Wish i could take my dog to the gym
Should I be laughing about the lack of weights on the bar? Probably not.
All I want in my life is a puppy
HES DOING THE BEAT HE CAN OKAY! Such a good boy
Spotter is on point today.  üòÇ
he wanna get fit like a ReAl MaN!!
Easy lickin‚Äôs.
Wait...That's exactly what they meant...
Motivation ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Isn‚Äôt it though ? That‚Äôs how I yoga
I just love dogs! They are absolutely the best!!
This is the kind of positive reinforcement I need to actually exercise... üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is that Chris Harrison??
Best cheerleader ever.
Dogs prolly mad at how this guy doesn‚Äôt hold the barbell above his wrists thus leading to potentially dangerous situations involving actual weight on the bar bluhfah
This is really cute.
Of topic, but watch out with your wrists. If you have that form with some weight on there, you will regret putting weight on there
u/savevideo
thanks for the post, u/TurdsforNipples
Why do puppies feel the need to jump all over your face when you lay down?
That "bench" is actually a table for facing licking, didn't you know?!
So...is he lifting just a bar?
mom said its my turn to post it this week >:(
Your man is pushing some weight.
poor bench form
[deleted]
Super cute but honestly just glad they were being safe for the video: no weights without a spotter is a good idea.

Seen some spooky shit
Silly guy forgot to put his weights on
Lol
 Look at the wrists
The puppy is so cute he forgot to put the weights on
So cute
Guy is weak
Why does he need a spotter there is no weight it‚Äôs like spongebob with the marshemellow stick
Bro, do you even lift?  -Dog
Gees you are weak I‚Äôm an eighth grader and can benc 110 for 2 reps of 7 that‚Äôs just 45 
But the doggies is very cute and I respect you not chancing hurting the puppo
Thought that was /u/govschwarzenegger at first.
/u/vredditshare
This is from the dodo, by the way.
THANK YOU FOR THIS VIDEO /u/TurdsforNipples
Damn that's some next level shit. Steadfastly continuing your work out while a puppy lathers you in drool as it's raspy, quick moving tongue laps up your sweat. Its paws rustle around your face, scraping and poking. Meantime, betwixt all this, its fluffy fur is periodically tickling your nose and gently stabbing your eye balls whenever they dare to slightly open.   Yup.
Ok that‚Äôs cute but where‚Äôs the weights on his bar
That‚Äôs pretty dangerous to press to do without a proper spotter.
Limp wrists, no weight, clearly the only time this guy uses the bench is when he‚Äôs trying to meme.
Lool he is not lifting anything...
I think I know the guy in the gif but I doubt it's OP
That guy looks exactly like someone I went to college with if he got his teeth fixed...which he might have.
Dude put some plates on that thing, you‚Äôre embarrassing the dog.
What does tjat man lift
This guy is going for ultra lean muscle.
He‚Äôs waiting till you put the weights on
Uh... mayb keep the dog out for a bit WHILE doing the workout. THEN go INTERACT w. It? At least u ain‚Äôt gon hurt urself
Impressive.
