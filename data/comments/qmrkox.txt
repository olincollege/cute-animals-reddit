"Ma'am, we want to discuss what we found your son doing on camera this Halloween..."
I love how he does his dance and then runs away.
His parents should be proud
I hope he never changes
I love how he ran away like he was doing something wrong. What an angel.
classic blue shirt guy
[deleted]
Ryan Reynolds reached out to his family via Twitter.
We need people like this. Good man
What a generous kid
Damn, and he's alone. Theres some kids in his neighborhood who don't know how good of a friend that could have right now.
You could tell the second when his inner monologue said 'Hey! Why not share your good fortune?', turns back to the bowl, and retrieves a generous handful of candy. Then skips happily away. 

Good on him and good on whomever raised this boy proper.
That kid's an Angel
Chris Farley?!
"Time to offload these apple slices...."
What did the note under the bowl say?
/u/gifreversebot
what a sweetheart!
I see Dwight from the office has grown a pretty big heart these days
Plot twist: it's reversed
Bruh he dropped in a pack of pretzels lol
[deleted]
He's so cute! What a good kid.

Thus was my son's first year trick or treating (couldn't be bothered last year between his age covid) and he kept trying to give people the candy from his basket. Obviously it wasn't an intentional act of kindness but it was still adorable. I hope he'll be like this kid when he's older.
Class act
Next year I'm just gonna leave an empty bowl outside my door, then I'll steal all the candy from nice kids like this.

BWAHAHAHA
So many videos of thieves taking all the candy.   It is wonderful to be reminded that there are two ends of the bell curve.  

Faith restored, cheers buddy.
What a wonderful little human!
Love that kid, never change little man, you a champ
The dance and the little run away ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is he really stressed up as Guy doing this?? If so, that's just even more amazing. 

This is one of those things I'd love to see Ryan Reynolds catch wind of.
What an awesome kid.  Must have awesome parents.
Is he blue shirt guy from free guy? I know off topic
Got rid of the bad candy he‚Äôs gotten to make room for more good stuff, this kids going places
Love the happy dance! Bravo!
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be a good guy, I‚Äôm going to be a GREAT guy. ‚Äú
This looks like he‚Äôs dumping an unwanted candy (maybe popcorn ball) that is taking up valuable real estate in his bag
That's a good kid.
Is he dressed as Matt Foley?
That‚Äôs no kid that‚Äôs Chris Farley
When no one is watching he did what was sweet and honorable. That young man has a bright future. His folks have done well as has he!
He danced as he put candy in the bowl, love his style.
I love to see my home state in a positive post! Yay!!

"Remember that time you were out trick or treating, and you came across that bowl that was empty, and so you took some candy from your bag and put it into the bowl so that other people could have some?  That was awesome."
I‚Äôve seen a few videos of people selfishly completely emptying whole bowls of treats. It‚Äôs nice to see such kindness. I hope he gets everything he wants for Christmas.
Sweet kid. He was nervous about being left behind as well.
10/10 for accompanying dance moves.
Bless that Kid's heart. Those are the things that make me smile.
And here I thought all hope was lost, this little gentleman gave back hope. üòÅ
People that do things for others with the expectation of never being recognized are the true heroes
Off topic, but don't most places wait until dark for trick or treating? That's what my neighbourhood does.
Blue t shirt guy is the best guy
Just getting rid of the stuff he doesn‚Äôt like lol
Plot twist: he just dropped a bag of 1000mg edibles into the bowl. Doing both gods and the devils work in one go
u/gifreversingbot
It's all nice and fluffy until you realize he just stocked the bowl with candy filled with razorblades.
Someone give this kid an award how wholesome is this?

*Oh, shit, no candy... but... other kids might need candy... * throws own candy in bowl and runs away **
His happy dance when he realized that he gets rid of thoseafteraids
I got dibs on posting this tmrw
Parents should be proud - they are raising a good one
Didn‚Äôt even wait a week to re-post it?
Are we going for a Reddit record on how often something can be reposted in a week on Reddit.
Tommy Boy!!!!!!!
Ah man this guy is amazing
Legend
Faith in humanity restored 100%
The naruto run away took it to the next level
Kid is going places
Is he Tommy Boy?
Please tell me his parents saw this!
Find that kid and give him some full size bars!
We don‚Äôt deserve him
Humanity is saved!
What‚Äôs the opposite of a robbery? A givery?
If billionaires would think like this‚Ä¶
Next level, this kid is built different.
Is he dressed like Tommy Boy?
This kid needs constant watch,care and counselling. 
Soon he will come across events in his life that may make him doubt his goodness and selflessness. He may think he was foolish all along. He will need someone to preserve this attribute in himself. I hope he gets it before it's too late.
‚ÄúSo shines a good deed in a weary world.‚Äù ~ William Shakespeare and Willy Wonka
And then Naruto runs away!
Lets not be to quick with praise, he may have picked out the worst thing in his bag and unloaded it to make space.
Then runs away like he did something bad, I love little boys, they never stop and think about things! XD
That‚Äôs not a kid, that‚Äôs Matt Foley, 35, twice divorced and lives in a van down by the river.
Quite a stark contrast from that other kid last year.
I was giving out candies as well and informed this kid that he was the last one to receive candies cause I was going to be out after him. Little hero proceeds to grab a handful of his own candy and throws them in my candy bucket. 

He saved me from telling the next group of kids, who were already walking towards me, that I was out. 

I was able to go inside in between groups thus saving me from disappointing some kids.
Don't have a good day, have a great day!
lil Collin Furze
Just doing it so people didn‚Äôt think it was him
I think he gave away his bags of pretzels to make room for more of the good stuff.
He was just giving his pretzels awayüòÇ
‚ÄúLocal boy drops acid laced pretzels in empty bowl in good deed gone‚Ä¶ trick‚Äù ‚ÄòI was just riding my bag of the largest non-candy item!‚Äô Said, so called, ‚Äògood deed boy‚Äô. Police are still looking for the origin of the acid laced pretzels. ‚Äú /s

Edit: made sure it was sarcastic
And he's dressed up as Blue Shirt Guy üò≠ so wholesome
God love him. His parents raised an amazing child!!  Kudos to them!! Makes my heart so happy ü•∞
Is that blue shirt guy?
Someone pls start a go fund me for this child‚Äôs education
I love him and wish everyone was like him
That kid is cool as shit.
Double dipping with this fake one, huh?
Now that‚Äôs a kid raised RIGHT.
Because that's what heroes do
That kid for president.
My kids deff arnt the ones who will dump the bowl, but they arnt gonna leave behind candy. Parenting goals, gotta step my game up a little.
God damn, that fuckin *melted* me. WHY CAN'T WE STAY LIKE THIS?
The way he runs away ü•∞
That little bounce he did because he wanted to be with his friends.

But he had to save the world first.
He was dancing while he did it lol
The kid in my neighborhood took my candy basket too.
Yet in my neighborhood the second group of kids took the whole bucket from someone‚Äôs front porch‚Ä¶. Including the bucket. This kid is awesome!
After seeing all the posts of people stealing all the candy, this is nice.
I think it‚Äôs wonderful he does a little dance. I mean it‚Äôs wicked generous if you think about it
We must protec him at all costs.
He‚Äôs free guy so it only makes sense he would do something like this
What a sweetheart ‚ù§
Then runs away like he did something wrong xD
Quick! Leave the pretzels and toothbrushes!
I hate to be *that* person about things but does anyone think it is a bit sketchy to upload a video of someone else‚Äôs kid on the internet?  

I‚Äôm not questioning the innocence of this video, just generally speaking and as a parent, it would not sit well with me to randomly see my kid in a video on the front page of reddit.
He said fuck it, ima ditch those twizzlers right here
This child sacrificed his least favorite candy to give someone else some candy
lil homie vibing while he does a good deed
Someone is raising a good human!
Its sad how a kid can give up something as little as one treat and we still have ADULTS taking whole bowls of candy disregarding the children also trick or treating
I think his costume is of Matt Foley and he found it down by the river. Regardless, he‚Äôs an effing saint!
I would 100% trust this person to make big, important decisions more than anyone currently involved in politics.
It looks like he just got rid of the candy he didn't want and did a runner haha
Napoleon run killed me
Candy has been planted.
That is wonderful to see people are so quick to show bad in kids it‚Äôs so great to see a boy doing something giving !! Thanks for the post
He just didn't want those chips.
He stole the candy, hacked the camera to reverse the video and collect internet karma. Evil genius.
My boy was just ditching the pretzels like the savage he is
Make this kid president
The dance though! He‚Äôs a good soul. 

This kid deserves a couple of those Costco candy bags for being so thoughtful and caring about other.
Good for him! This guy is a real good human being. He's a good boy!
No one thinks this is staged? This isn't the Reddit I know.
That kid is going places I‚Äôm telling ya.
Awesome kid
This is winning at life but losing at capitalism
Kids are dressing up as cubicle workers for Halloween now??
Sing like nobody‚Äôs watching, and Dance.  Good Boy well on his way to becoming a Good Man.

His parents deserve to be proud of their son.
Real modern hero
Legit looks like a cocaine drop the way he runs lol
Why does he look like he‚Äôs done something wrong with that Naruto run
That's a good kid right there, cares more about hanging with his friends than candy, his little "hurry hurry gotta go" dance he's doing is great
This child is wholesome!
Holy shnikies, did he dress up as Tommy Boy!
This kid needs his parents spoken to while he‚Äôs there and told how awesome he is.
upvoting for the Naruto run in the end
This kids parents just won child rearing.
This might be the coolest, most human thing I‚Äôve ever seen. True empathy.
Definition of: He comes from good ppl.
Lil chad in the making
I wouldn't have thought this is possible

but i want to believe
It was poisioned and hes a 40 yo man
It's in reverse, he actually stole them.
Morals: the things we do when we think no one is watching. This kid has great morals.
And then there are people like this
Little does everyone know he was just trying to get rid of the garbage candy he didn‚Äôt want and ends up on r/awww
Unregulated Capitalism is what emptied the bowl.  Socialism saved the day.
He was actually just getting rid of the shitty chips
I'm pretty sure if you land in the empty bowl, you can the entire bowl across the street. Mancala rules.
The sweetest kid in the world! I love his nervous dance & the way he runs away! The world needs more kids like this ‚ù§Ô∏è
What was his costume? Chris Farley?
That is not what's happening. He clearly is ditching whatever "the weird house" in the neighbor hood was giving instead of candy. One larger thing, maybe like a bag of chips?
Nice repost for karma
Looks more like he found the perfect spot to dump the dehydrated fruit snack bag he got at the last house.  One snack-sized bag went into the bowl LOL
Little communist!
Plot twist, he‚Äôs just returning what he stole because he was overwhelmed with guilt
Okay, I wanna believe the altruism, but I have to know what the note under the bowl says first.
He‚Äôs definitely just dumping his Jolly Ranchers


Look at how he runs off as if he did something wrong
Why are you posting videos of other people‚Äôs kids?
It‚Äôs such a nice thing what he did but I think we should be talking about how comfortable people are with posting videos of minor children that are not their own online.
You saved, cropped and reposted?
Zoom, crop, repost!
I especially like how he dressed as Jim from the office
Awesome!
lol this came out like 5 years ago. Move on.
Is he Tommy Boy?? Holy schnikes, that was a good deed!
I hope we get to know this kid
There seems to be so much door cam footage available on Reddit...why do so many people have security cameras? I've always lived in apartments or suites, so I don't have a lot of experience being accessible from the street, but I'm wondering if it's overkill for so many people to have cams. Is there an element of 'suburban homeowner is afraid of everything'? I'm sure they're very useful in certain places, but it just feels weird to me.
Stupid socialist - Some GQP'er, probably.
Fake.
He literally grabbed a handful of candy without even looking. Lmao. What are you on about?
Filming and posting videos of kids without their or their parents consent is really messed up. Look at that sidewalk, I bet that house films anyone who walks by on the street every day. People in the UK are getting sued and losing for that.
dude was def getting rid of some pretzels
He‚Äôll remember how stupid he was doing this when he‚Äôs older and getting taxes taken out of his paycheck bet he wont do that again
The reason he did this is because he didn't want the others who came after him to believe he took all the candy in the bowl.
Nah he got rid of candy he didn‚Äôt want lol
I think he just threw some shit in there he didn‚Äôt want‚Ä¶..just sayin.
Pretty sure he chucked his worst piece of candy in there
Best way to get rid of candy corn or other things you didn't want like toothpaste or something.
He 100% ditched the apple some asshat gave him in the bowl.
Great way to offload your shitty candy and any non-candy items.
Video is in reverse
This is reversed
That kids is not a liberal.
Great kid! Love the tie too!
This
And he was happy to do it!
Plottwist the video is played backwards
This made me very happy.
Thats the type of drive by giving i'm talking about!
Some of these people in this world want's what is good for other people.. I am so glad that almost tears comes out.
Hope for our future-good soul.
See folks the man living in a van down by the river has a heart of gold
Good boi
It's nice to see there are some good ppl left in this world.
That‚Äôs a sweetheart.
Someone get that kid whatever he wants
The most awesome kid of 2021!!
I like how his costume is just a tie and some kakis
That's a good kid.
NPCs can be heros too.
The GoFundMe of Halloween
Raisins: nature‚Äôs candy.
looks like he has to pee

&#x200B;

source: same dance I do when I have to pee
Dwight Shrute?
Wholesome boy
If I could bestow powers upon people, I'd be looking for this kid stat.
That‚Äôs so wholesome‚ò∫Ô∏è
Also, that's a sick Colin Furze costume.

u/colinfurze
Such a generous little businessman
This is why I probably should not have kids, I would be gushing/crying about everything amazing they do (big or small) How do parents do it!
Why do you run Away like that
that video is clearly in reverse!
he threw the chips in there, quite the little prankster
I feel like this kid is going to feel like Charlie Bucket soon.
we need more humans like this kid
Is this kid dressed as Charlie Kelly working in the mailroom?
Sweet kid
That kid is the B.E.S.T!!!! Love him!
Was that Dwight?
What a fucking legend
I'm more middle-of-the-road generous.  I would probably put stuff in there that I didn't like, but others might, rather than something random.  Otherwise it's probably going to waste anyway.
what an awesome kid
My kiddos did the same for a few houses. They had plenty and were all about sharing. I love this!
Kid needs a little coat.
r/humansbeingbros
What an idiot!
/u/GifReversingBot
Great kid
Raised him right
This is adorable but what is it he throws in the bowl? It looks like one solid item and not a handful of candy.
Oh my goodness. This is making me tear up. Some kids are just too good!!
Good boy! üëçüòâ
I used to be good like this, still am,  love being generous (dont like to recieve really). But there were dark ages roughly from 11yo--18/19yo. Forgot what it was called...
So glad to see someone raised their kid with kindness and consideration for his peers.
Blue shirt guy/ Free Guy Movie
Just doing his part for the community ü•∫
The world needs more people like this. Bless this person‚Äôs soul!!!
He looks to make sure no one sees his good deed.
This has given me more hope than any other story or article read in a while
We had some kids take all of our candy from the bowl and left a bag of chili cheese Fritos.
Oh no he's unlocked reverse truck or treating, he is to powerful
Plot twist: this video is being showed in reverse
You missed the part where his costume is from Free Guy. Main character goes around doing good deeds for people.
this is the ‚Äúyou know i had to do it to em‚Äù sidewalk
This kid reached blind into his bag. The other video like this the kids pick out their crap candy, probably because mom's gonna throw some out anyway.
Well, that was unexpected. Bro kid!
Wholesome AF
what a sweetheart
Life goal. Be this kid.
Do you know how rare it is to find a person who would do something completely selflessly? He didn‚Äôt know he was being seen, and he wouldn‚Äôt see the benefit of his action himself. He didn‚Äôt do that so he could be praised or even to see the joy he‚Äôd bring another person for himself; that act came purely from the kindness of his heart in its desire for another person. He was genuinely just thinking about the next kid getting some sweets. Bless his heart 1000 times
He acted as if there were not sweets in this package, but drugs
He put the cheetos and fruit snacks in there.
Probably because some Karen and her kid just took off with all of it...
Who is this hero parents We need to show  them what a great man they made.
Holy fornicating balls, that boy is my absolute fornicating idol in life!
This kid was raised right
My guess....is that it was something he didn't really want.

He's dressed like he lives in a *vay-un* down by the *river.*
This kid wins Halloween.
What a legend.
Ya gotta speculate to accumulate
Faith in humanity restored by a big boned Dennis the menace looking kid
Who is this kid dressed as, Jim from the Office?
Lil man's vibin!!
I left a note asking trick or treaters to please be kind. By the time my kids and I got back to our house, I saw a kid approach the bowl, grab the last candy and then do a double take on the sign. He put it back. Asked him to wait for me because I had more inside. He was gone. Kid was probably around 10yo. There‚Äôs some hope left for this planet of ours
I love how he looked both ways to make sure the coast was clear before he did something kind. Chaotic good.
"greed is human nature"
This is awesome, what a great kid
Why did he sprint like he committed a crime
I hope he grows up to be just as caring and kind as he is here - great kid, does the right thing when no one is watching.
It looked like he was going to do the Indiana Jones switch with the idol at the beginning.
No he didn't. He dumped some garbage non candy that a shit house gave him.
Thanks for the uplift. /trashy had a barage of posts about people taking all the candy instead and I almost lost faith in humanity.
That‚Äôs awesome!  My nephew just started crying when he got to an empty candy bowl. But he‚Äôs a little shit.
Hope Ryan Reynolds sees this kid‚Ä¶ nice free guy costume
What a kindhearted kid.
Great kid!
Good for him
Mans dressed up like his White collar Dad for Halloween
This gets posted every year around Halloween. It‚Äôs awesome. 
But gosh it‚Äôs been used a lot
What a homie
My daughter does the same and has for years.. I am very proud of her, she did it the first time when she was about 5 without any suggestion from me or anyone else and she has continued to do so year after year. God bless the children who think of others before themselves.
I like to imagine he‚Äôs dressed up as Chris Farley
I love the business casual costume
Great kid! Hope life won't beat him down too much.
Way did the paper say
Just goes to show kids are better at being human than adults
He put the thing he didn‚Äôt want
Champ
him and his parents deserve recognition and a present
This kid would win the Wonka chocolate factory.
Aw, such a sweet kid.
Probably all raisins‚Ä¶
I hope this kid ends up rich
This video is reversed, the kid took all the candy
Are we sure he wasn‚Äôt just pawning off the Good & Plenty, Necco wafers and black licorice?
What a sweetheart ü•∫
Best thing I've seen all day. What a great human being he is :))) awww!!!
His parents are doing a great job.
His parents should be proud of him
The dance
He actually filled the bowl with the adult entertainment cards they hand out in Vegas.
Is he supposed to be Collin furze for.halloween?
This happened in my city this year too, it's been all over the local news and they interviewed the kids and everything. Some of these kids are alright.
That moment he hesitates before walking away the first time. That‚Äôs the moment he realizes he can do something good for a stranger. The most genuine generosity there is to see out there. Love it. Imma try to be more like this kid
/u/gifreversingbot
Boy is the next generation of Area 51 raiders with a naruto run like that
Can someone loop it in reverse please
He definitely ditched a bag of pretzels ü•®
His name is Hope
I hope his parents find out what a wonderful little boy a lot of people see him to be!
Is he blue shirt guy from free guy? I know off topic
Looks like rowley from diary of a wimpy kid, something he would do too
This gives me faith in humanity.
He runs away like he placed a timebomb or some shit
He was just offloading the shitty candy ü§£
Why‚Äôd he run like he committed a crime??
This is a good kid.
Young chad
The kid does a good deed and gets rid of the crap candy! Win win! Smart man!
Amazing! What a good soul. Parents should be very proud.
Did nobody see the Naruto run? 
He's gone to eternity.
Nah, he just dumped his pretzels.
Just witnessed a Chad in the making
Are we sure he dropped candy in there? Judging from that dance and that run, I think that may have been a stink bomb or some type of incendiary device. Still a good kid.
I love that he runs away like he just did something bad
The best part is he ran after. Not expecting respect or a reward.
Is he supposed to be Colin furze?
That kid's alright.
I feel like I used to be this person. Good Lord have I changed >.<
Everyone says he's a good kid, but he just saw an opportunity to ditch the shitty treats he got.
Great boy üôè
put the candies that were attacked to his Magnet
Brothers don't shake hands! Brothers gotta hug!
Man i wish i was this kid getting appreciation by many random people not even my friends appreciate me but that probably means i am a useless bitch
Omg give that boy a lifetime of free candy
Don't have a good day have a great day
AWWWWWWW
Upvote so this guys parents find him, and double his allowance.
Also he‚Äôs dressed as Tommy Boy, who was such a wholesome character. Kid really committed to this costume.
U/gifreversingbot
mam he gave you all his wrappersüòÇ
Is that a little Colin Furze costume?
Shouldn't he be in a van, down by the river?
Is this video playing in reverse or something like.... 

Good on ya kid, ur parents should be proud.
Is he dressed as guy from free guy?
And did a little dance to boot. What a cool kid!!
he's about to do the naruto run... show us his naruto run!
Reverse trick or treating‚Ä¶.interesting
And done it without a moments thought!
Little did we know. The vid was actually reversed
That‚Äôs a good egg!
I hope he was Tommy Boy for Halloween. What a rad kid
Am I the only one who thought he ditched a bag of popcorn in that bowl?
So sweet!!! Whoever‚Äôs raising that boy is doing a fantastic job‚Ä¶.
He ran because he was GUILTY! Guilty of being an awesome kid.
He‚Äôs going far in life
Love the headward first run away at the end. Good kid!
Hes to good for this world *loads 44 magnum*
He takes joy in doing good deeds. What a great kid
Hey mom and dad congratulations on raising a wonderful young man
Faith in humanity restored!
Love the happy dance
This was actually so cute and almost made me tear up
And you compare it to the other kid that didn‚Äôt want to take it all, and her father came up from the street to empty the bowl into her bag to her objections‚Ä¶.  Free stuff brings out the worst and best of us.
You know that paper says, ‚Äúif empty please share #payitforward‚Äù. Fuckin cheapskates.
And was happy to do it.
Yeah we saw this yesterday.
This made me tear up. How awesome and sweet!!
That kid was having a great day.  And wanted to spread his happiness and excitement.
Plot twist it‚Äôs in reverse
Plot twist: it was mini toothpaste and mini toothbrushes.
That kid is going somewhere üëçüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
WHAT DOES IT SAY ON THE PIECE OF PAPER??
If we had more people like him, then we wouldn't be in this mess.
Dashes tf outta there to recoup his losses.
What a kind young man
From what I'm seeing on twitter he was dressed as Guy from Free Guy and Ryan Reynolds is already in contact with them to reward him for being a decent guy
it's stealing, just backwards
ENFJü§î
THATS SO CUTEE
Getting rid of the shit that‚Äôs gonna stay in that bag till Christmas.
Good job buddy ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
u/gifreversingbot
How do I raise a good kid like that? Man...
We need more like him
What an awesome human being!
He was just doing his thing as BSG. Bless.
Such a thoughtful and nice kid
The bomb has been planted
Now that we have seen the reverse, play it it forward
i like how he runs away like he stole the whole bowl
"Sweet, now I can get rid of these pretzels and cough drops"
OP out here stealing videos
Nah he was dropping some shit he don‚Äôt like looked like a single bag of pretzels or something, can‚Äôt be wasting space and weight in the bag with some low grade loot
Fuck yes
His parents could of got him a stume
!taert ro kcirT
Good kid
Good parents; good kid.
What a joy to behold! And I loved his dance:)
Or his asshole friends took it all and he had the good conscious. Either way what a move by that guy.
He threw in the crap he didn't want...haha
Momma raised a gentleman
Lmao I don't know if I'm sensitive rn but this almost made me cry
Thank you for being the kind of human the world needs. And thank you to his parents for helping him along the way.
Or he put a bunch of razors in there.  Ran like hell.
What a cool kid. He'll grow up to be a good man
I watched this the first time and was like yay.... but on rewatching he definitely dumped pretzels or apple slices.   Which is why he looks guilty and giggly as he runs away üòÇüëç
Chad
Raised right
This kid is legit happy to give his candy to someone else. Not many people like this little guy around.
great kid. but who is trick or treating in broad daylight.
For President
Is he dressed as Free guy? Because that would be so perfect
Awesome kid
What a sweetpea.
Our local teenagers were doing this too, so the little kids did t miss out. üíñ
Plot twist: this video is reversed
He dressed as a mormon for Halloween.
The little happy dance üòÇ
Understandable, he's being Blue Shirt Guy.

![gif](giphy|fsOqjDAZOuxu9pgu71)
Good job kid! My daughter and her friend always do this. So sweet. They got caught replacing candy by an owner this year and the owner immediately opened the door and thanked them and replenished the bowl and their bags.
I love his hurried anxious half squats like c‚Äômon nobody can see this. What a great kid! I hope he gets everything he wants for Christmas
I hope he never gives that up.
Someone find him and give him a ps5 or something
Good kid!
My god these are the exact same comments on the last repost.
Character is the measure of what someone does when no one is looking .  This kid has truly good character.
Plot twist: Kid returning the candy to the bowl he emptied earlier
He got tricked‚Ä¶
Heartwarming‚Ä¶ but It saddens me that I assumed that someone called the cops on him or complained‚Ä¶..
Somebody get this kid a medal, and a bunch of candy
Don‚Äôt look to your neighbors to see what they have, look at them to make sure they have enough. Kid is being raise right!
Needs a wee
Plot twist: it was chocolate covered raisins.
u/ReverseVideoBot
Take a candy leave a candy
Good upbringing
Good boy
Let‚Äôs find this kid and send him a box of candy!
This happened in my town! Awesome to see a great kid do this!
One would think about the candies he left behind when he even performed the dance treat. This boy will grow up to be a fine man. May he be blessed. :')
Can someone reverse this and call it "kid steals the last of the candy in the bowl" just like "Gods Plan but Kanye steals money from poor people"
Amazing job of the parents and a great kid!
He definitely put the bag of Cracker Jack's back in there. Good choice..
I thought he got rid of something he didn‚Äôt want that was heavy and weighing him down‚Ä¶like an apple lolol
One of the greatest things to happen to kids this year. Ryan Reynolds has absolutely set a standard for kids with Free Guy. He's made being the good guy cool again. Also this kid kills it with the free guy costume, now we just need to get him a little gold fish
this gives me hope for humanity‚ò∫Ô∏è
Whoever raised him did a fantastic job.
ive done this as a kid a few times! 30 years old now, but i remember feeling bad for the kid behind me who didnt get anything. gave some to them and then i put more candy in the bucket. i want to say i was like 9 or 10
MY HEARTTTTT :(
Is that blue shirt guy?
I would Sooooooo Proud To See this video of this were my child![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out). Great Job Mom and Dad, Ya Dun Good!

![gif](giphy|gHKnFHkGPUmG4GTzUt)
This was very nice, but y‚Äôall know it was the bag of hard pretzels. Lol least that‚Äôs what I would have done.
Good for this young man. But what the hell is the costume??
That‚Äôs not candy, that‚Äôs a bag of broccoli!
Bullshit..... It's in reverse
Plot twist. It‚Äôs his house.
I don‚Äôt know who this kid is but I will harm someone to protect him ü•∫
He's just getting rid of the raisins he got from the house next door
There‚Äôs a Chris Farley joke in here somewhere. Something about living in a van down by the river. I‚Äôll let you come up with it though.
Is he dressed as Colin Furze?
This kid was raised right.
One in a million‚Ä¶
Legend
Can people like this run for office when they grow up? It sure would be nice.
See, the scourge of communism is already coming for our children!

#obviouslysarcasm
My man running away like he's gonna be in trouble for that
‚ÄúHumans are motivated by greed‚Äù

This kid: [gleefully chucks own candy into bowl to bring joy to others, flees giddily]
plot twist they were poisonous
I'd track that kid down and give him a box of full-sized candy bars of his choice.

Not too often you find a kid like this.
Why‚Äôd he run like he pulled a prank
It's a good reminder that most kids are good and thoughtful.  Also faith in humanity right there.
This is actually police footage and the ‚Äúchild‚Äù was leaving edibles and needle-laced snickers
I do that ü••
It doesn‚Äôt take a genius to see that this video is reversed.
Dirty socialist. /s
Then the next kid stole the bowl üòé
WHAT DOES THE NOTE SAY?!
Hope for the future
I've seen about 5 versions of this video in the past week...
Not saying it's not a sweet gesture but also sense sense some like farming going on
Bless him, how sweet is this little guy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Future president
This is great!! This made me happy! Some kids took my bowl and everything in it last year within the first half hour of trick or treating. He should be so proud of himself, his parents have done a fine job raising this young man!
Plot twist. Those were bounty chocolates
Savage!
What a little legend
I don‚Äôt think this is the heartwarming affirmation of humanity‚Äôs decency that everyone else does. Here‚Äôs why:

+ To my eye, he throws just one item in there.
+ The one item he throws is oddly large for Halloween candy.
+ It looked like he specifically grabbed for that particular item.

I suspect that this is a case of a normal kid taking the opportunity to ditch a bag of healthy, non-candy hippie snack garbage. He deserves credit, but only for depositing his trash in the one receptacle that might allow it to be snatched by someone who likes that crap.

Sorry folks, but I was a pretty sweet kid, and I would NEVER have willingly parted ways with my Halloween stash. NEVER!!!
But what's written on the note?!
Kid is going places!
What a lad.
He got rid of his candy corn etc.
He was thinking ‚Äúdo I give away my good stuff or these bags of chips‚Äù
The naruto run at the end was the cherry on top of this sweet video
Video is in reverse
Plot twist: he gave away the shitty candy
guys i am pretty sure those were firecrackers, hence his running so fast before they blew!
What a boss.
This kind of person is the kind that makes this world still function! World needs more people like this! My hat is off for this kid.
What does the sign under the bowl say?
I love how he runs away as to not be caught doing a good deed.  True altruism.
It‚Äôs in reverse
r/chaoticgood
Speed
Do we know who this kid is? Would love for him to get the recognition he so deserves!
I like how he was like ‚Äúok let me do something nice‚Ä¶ welp, see you later‚Äù
Good dude.
that‚Äôs some hokage energy with his run at the end
How do I call the reverse bot
i wanna buy that kid all the candy!
I swear this kid is everywhere on Reddit now
Should be in r/nextfuckinglevel also.
ü•≤
Dang that was a big handful too. Good for him
A random act of kindness
Can I adopt this kid? I think getting one that‚Äôs already well trained would better suit my personality and schedule.
I especially respect the fact that there was no attempt to segregate the wheat from the chaff. He just dug out a handful, became a legend, and moved on.
I love his little dance that he's doing while digging out his candy real quick.   
What a goddamn ace of a human being.
Step 1: Place empty bowl at door

Step 2: Wait for a kid to put their sweets in bowl

Step 3: Profit
Like a boss
Reminds me of a little Chris Farley
He is getting rid of his chips!  Nobody wants chips in their Halloween sack
What a sweet lil guy! his little dance too!
How sweet is that! ü•≤
This kid looks like my cousin‚Äôs boy (who‚Äôs do something like that). I wonder where this is.
Here‚Äôs hoping the world properly nurtures his mindset.
You are giving this kid too much credit - he was just getting rid of his shitty candy to make room for good candy. Smart kid, he cant pull the wool over my eyes though!
Awww! Great ! Just great!
And I bet he got away with putting razors in them to lol
In contrast to my neighborhood where I left a bowl of candy out and some punk kid took everything, including the bowl.
Kid didn't share he dumped what he didn't like and ran away
lil homie dropped the popcorn ball and boogied on out.
My youngest son was like this, he would save his candy and share with bothers and friends when they ran out of candy. He had a friend that wasn't allowed to trick or treat and he would bring a extra bag at Halloween for that kid.
Kid better run! No good deed goes unpunished.
you know what, maybe this world will be ok
I love the guilty run at the end.
  
Seeing this is like a breeze of fresh air
Love those kids. So sweet. Better than I was lol
I feel like leaving a jar of candy is kind of lazy, i mean the whole point of trick or treating is so that kids get to ‚Äúscare‚Äù you
He ditched the toothbrush and apple slices
Well educated kid!
Hope in humanity has been restored.
I like how he runs off, like he‚Äôs done something he shouldn‚Äôt have done.
Everyone thinks this kid is being good, but he is really getting rid of candy he doesnt like.
I‚Äôd do the same but I‚Äôll put the ones that I don‚Äôt like in the bowl. I don‚Äôt like the peanut butter ones
Here's my healthy stuff suckers
Was that the start of a Naruto run at the end there??
Great kid, great costume, check on him in 30 years after he‚Äôs been wearing that same suit and tie
This!
Very rare footage of kid giving candy
I like how he slaps the candy down
What a great kid. Its the things we do when we think no one is watching that shows our character the most.
Nah he just dumped the candy he didn‚Äôt want to eat
What a sweetheart
Great parents and a really fine kid.  Well raised.
He‚Äôs going to heaven
Faith in humanity restored!
That‚Äôs a fine young man right there
I needed this.
There‚Äôs hope.
Do you wanna be on Kimmel, Fallon and Ellen(? Probably not!) this year and the next?!  
Because this is how you do it! :D

Sube he left the candy he doesn‚Äôt like lol
Chaotic good.
When i grow up i wanna be like him
My boy so happy he doesnt have to eat those veggies
Faith in humanity restored. Wife and I were out of the house for trick or treat night, left out a bowl of candy with a please only take a few sign and our camera caught literally the first trick or treater come by and swipe the whole bowl.
He did a good thing but ran away like she stole the whole shit.
If I didn‚Äôt just watch free guy literally last week I would have asked why he‚Äôs not wearing a costume lol.
honor system complete
This kid for President.
What song was in his head while he was boppin?
It‚Äôs in reverse
That's a dope "middle manager" costume.

What a gesture. Good kid.
He ran away lol! Cutest shit ever. Hell ya kid.
He has been raised well. I'd be so bloody proud if that were my boy.üòä
*everybody liked that
Good kid!
Its dancing for me üòÇ
Dawg like how are you this good of a person. Like wtf. Like ima good person but like I would have not thought of doing that lol. I‚Äôm really astonished rn.
Rookie mistake üòÇ
What a thoughtful young man with a big heart. I hope his parents or someone who knows him sees this and let‚Äôs him see these comments.
Cause that's totally something Guy would do!  Well done kid :)
And he did it without anyone watching, which makes this even more honorable
Plot twist it‚Äôs a bomb
This kid for POTUS
That young man was taught to think of others and to share. (Unlike the Karen and her teen brats who stole ALL the candy from a house. It‚Äôs on the Internet. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|rage)) I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs going to do well for himself in the coming years.

To that young lad: Thanks for restoring some of my faith in humanity.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)
Is the kid dressed as free guy?
He literally contemplated and ran off like he had stolen something out of that candy bowl instead of donating. ü§£
Who's he supposed to be. Suit guy?
The ‚Äú I‚Äôm bout to do a good deed dance‚Äù was the icing on the cake for me. This kid is definitely a main character.
Where I live everyone that had ring cameras and candy sitting outside is posting videos of the first trick or treaters taking everything.  Parents watching and not second guessing a child lugging back 10lbs of candy.
He Naruto‚Äôs the heck out of there loll
Plot twist. Kid was just losing the bad candy without his parents noticing
SLPT: set out an empty bowl for halloween and someone else will fill it for you.
Meanwhile I remember grown ass men clearing out box of chocolates when there are 5 people behind him waiting
Humanity would be in a lot better condition if more of these kind of humans existed!
I was a fat kid I wouldn't have given up my candy
It‚Äôs blue shirt guy! He gets points for being nice.
Is it colinfurze
What a proud moment for his parents‚Ä¶
