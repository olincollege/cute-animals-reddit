This is so sweet. I‚Äôm so glad he has such kind humans!
Instant tail wagging ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for the tip. My dog is deaf and blind so I've been struggling to find a good way to wake her without startling her. I'm going to give this a try.
[removed]
Is that a blue heeler? Cutest dog in the world! That smile just melts my heart.
*sniff* moms here
SHE CAN HAVE MY HEARING I DONT NEED IT
Can confirm that this is the best way to wake a deaf puppers (who could previously hear).  If you touch them, they startle and wake up thinking they're being attacked and kind of in a panic.  But their nose will awake them gently and, in most cases, very happy about what they're smelling.  When we have the need, we love to wake our girl up with treats because her tail will start wagging before her eyes open.
Such a heartwarming video. Doggo smells mom, cue immediate tail wagging and smiling eyes. 

My parents' dog is going deaf with age, will definitely start doing this with her.
when i am laying, sound asleep

my world is quiet, still

the thoughts of you inside i keep

forever, friend i will

i canno hear you say my name,

but feel your gentle touch

it wakes me softly, just the same

cuz i love you so much!

your smiling face, your human smell

i've felt it from the start

i am the dog you love so well -

i hear you 

with my heart

‚ù§Ô∏è
Heightened sense of smell...
Great way to let her know you are there!!
Thanks for petting him for me. I tried but couldn't through the computer screen.
Who put onions here?
What a good baby. ‚ô•Ô∏è
 I read "waking up a dead pup", prepared myself to see the dog Jesus
Smell my fingers bro
I have a deaf cat. I will sometimes wake him up by stroking a finger along his head. I love the sleepy chirp he gives as he wakes up followed by his happy meow when he realizes it's me.
You can just see the gentleness and love in his eyes. This is honestly the cutest thing I've ever seen.
Going against the grain here, but I‚Äôll purposely surprise my deaf dog when he‚Äôs sleeping or unaware I‚Äôm around. One toddler and one crawler in the house so I don‚Äôt want his first reaction to surprise to be bad. 

So I‚Äôll often surprise him and then praise him or give a treat. Now when a rugrat grabs his tail with him unaware, he thinks something good is happening. (He‚Äôs been deaf since birth)
My heart grew ten sizes today
WHAT A GOOD BOIIIIIIII
That's a cute dog!
Sweet doggo!
I actually really appreciate this video. Besides being adorable, it shows how I can properly wake up my dog, who is going deaf from age. I‚Äôve always ended up startling him on accident, but this will help. Thank you!
Dogs are just so damn great
My girlfriend's dog is getting old and deaf. One day we came home from a party and found the dog lying in the middle of the room, not moving at all. We both thought the worst, petted her, nothing happened. After some more petting for what felt like forever, she springs to life, exactly like in this video. Never been so relieved in my life! Dogs are too good for this world man.
I have 2 deaf cats. Waking them up is my favorite thing in the world
After reading so many of the comments here, I just started crying uncontrollably. 

I currently have an almost 14 year old Golden Retriever, and getting him is the best thing that has ever happened to me. As Goldens usually don't get to the age he's at, I can call myself a very lucky owner. However, I know the sweet guy isn't going to live very long anymore, and it's been bothering me very much for a while now, to the extent that I dream about him about to be out down every single week, and me also uncontrollably crying in the dreams. Same dream every week.

He's had a good life, and the whole family has always been caring for him deeply. He's been on a lot of very fun trips with us.

Lately, he's been having some physical and mental issues. He can't sleep on his own anymore. If he does, he will mindlessly walk around the room all night. Therefore, I sleep next to him at night and this feels comfortable for him. Also, hips aren't great anymore, and very often when I go for a walk, he will just randomly trip and fall on the ground, and I usually have to help him get up. It truly breaks my heart. Yet, he doesn't seem to bother very much and continues sniffing the world.

He's been with me for more than half of my life, and I'm extremely grateful. This video and all the comments just reminds me again I will have to say my final goodbye to him soon.
The last year of my Freddy‚Äôs life he had gone completely deaf. I would come home every day to find him curled up on my bed waiting for me like this. Thank you for sharing. Brought back warm memories of my best friend.
When somebody approaches you and does this same gesture...
There‚Äôs usually a foul smell.
That is so sweet
I miss my pup :(
I frickin LOVE Australian Cattle dogs!
Booping the snoot turns the doggo on. :D So cute.
how can dogs wake up with vigor instantly? and how can I learn this power?
All deaf dogs are the most important to have. Anything you can do to make an impact on that little dogs heart. I‚Äôm glad you have one because that is what that dog needs. Thank you
This was a super great gif and then I put the sound on and heard the thump thump thump and I died.  Congrats, I'm dead now.  I hope you're happy.  I sure am.
I had a deaf Dalmatian. I would stomp on the floor when I came in the house so she.would know I was home. I had hand signals ... Walk... I love you.... I miss her!
i wish reddit was just stuff like this and none of the trollling negative crap
Why wouldn't you just let him sleep tho
That's goddamn precious.
This cleansed my soul!!!!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
This is precious!
That baby is loved and she knows it.  :)
/r/specialaww
Thank you for posting this.  Your pho‚Äôs love for you and your kindness really melted my heart.
I love this.  


I'm a deaf guy so it warms me up pretty good when I see things like this.  


Tips for *communication*:  


1) Stomp your feet to get their attention. I'm not talking about knee-breaking stomps. Just a little stomp stomp. It alerts them of your presence if you're a bit of a distance away.

2) Flicking light switches on/off. You can train them to understand that it is you switching lights on and off by showing them the mechanism.

3) Tap on their shoulder to get their attention or rub 'em like the OP did. Perfectly done.

4) Give them real basic gestures. Like eat, drink, poop, pee, drive, etc. You name it. It can be done! All you have to do is associate the act with the gesture!  


I am just trying to give tips for people who may get a deaf dog <3
That's the cutest fucking thing I've seen in my entire fucking life
70 k karma on post but only 20k karma total wtf reddit
T H O SE 

M L E M S
My godness, my heart exploded!!
This doggo has the best family. What a sweet pup! So happy to be awake with her loving family. üòä
<3
He looks like a fox when his ears go down and his eyes are all wide. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Good puppers...
Ah that's so sweet! Best pup!
Cutest thing I've seen all day
My old girl is almost completely deaf, it definitely takes care not to startle her awake
WAAAAG!
I would pet the hell outta this guy
Aww <3
Such a good dog!
This is so wholesome
Sweet girl! That tail :)
He‚Äôs so cute,that‚Äôs so amazing! I‚Äôm just scared that you have to keep him on a leash as the poor pupper couldn‚Äôt do recall!
Ahhhhh I want a turn!!!
So cute!
r/mademesmile
This is so nicely done, so sweet and gentle.  You are a lovely human.
Just <3
Omg the instant tail wag. What an angel.
Let him sleep
What a sweetheart!
Please give him lots of treats üôÇ
That waggy tail :)
God Bless !
That's a good pup and you're a good person :)
üòçüòç
Give him some love from me!
I wake my cat up with cheese sometimes. He's not deaf, but it works every time. Cute dog!
I spy a heeler! So cute!

I have two heeler mixes. üòÅ
Does anyone else upvote these kind of posts before the video even starts playing?
Omg his tail the instant he realized who was waking him up you can see the joy he is feeling such beautiful boy üòçüòçüòç
Anyone who‚Äôs had a senior dog has done this... my girls before they passed would sleep so deep because they had lost all or some of their hearing.


It‚Äôs another reason using hand signals when training your dogs becomes important 

It‚Äôs such a cute moment the recognition of your smell.
I read the title and for a moment there thought the owner was about to blast an air horn in its ears or something. Like it went to bed a hearing php, found itself waking up a deaf pup.
That tail thumping sound!!!
I think this would be a great way to awaken hearing dogs, too. Smells mean more to a dog than anything!
I would yelling be from across the room asking him to wake up but then realize I‚Äôm stupid and proceed to give him pet pats.
Our German Shepherd lost her hearing at about 9. I would forget all the time and she would be sleeping on the couch and I would want to snuggle her. I would push on the couch cushion next to her. I wish I would‚Äôve thought to do this. Poor girl would just get startled all the time.
Oh my god 
What a good boy
Best boy
Might be a stupid question but do deaf dogs bark?
After my kitty Puff went deaf, at 16, I taught her signs for food, come here, and no. She was smart and learned quickly. Also she was an indoor cat. She lived for 3 years after that.
Your hand looks dope, nice style.
That‚Äôs the cutest fucking thing I‚Äôve ever seen in my life
Damn. My r/australiancattledog doesn't listen at all. He can hear, just doesn't listen. I know its characteristic to the breed. I should try this.
Tried that with my dog but she also kinda blind and thought I was the cat so she snapped at me. So we just leave her be for the most part
How can dogs wake up and be immediately ready to go, whereas when I wake up, it takes me ages to even be able to keep my eyes open and I feel miserable for the next 16-18 hours?
This is perfect. It makes me feel good to know that somewhere out there things are just wholesome.
Ouch, my heart hurts. I live for stuff like this.
Aww, my heart melts..
Ahhh omg, my heart just melted!! *hugs and kisses*üñ§üíô
Oh my goodness these comments are making me cry. One thing I know for sure is animals teach us human kindness, they teach us to love and they never judge.  Gonna be sure I spend some EXTRA quality time with my fur baby. ‚ù§Ô∏è
My deaf dog used to have a habit of sitting in corners, I think it was because no one can sneak up behind you from a corner.
Dear lord! Those ears and tail scream a lovely relationship. So gorgeous.
her nose can hear just fine, thank you!
I turned the sound on like a moron.
Aww, she looks like my Piper girl.
I do the same thing with my deaf cat! As soon as he smells me walking up to him, he opens his eyes and starts purring.
I have a blue heeler that was born deaf as well. When we wake her up she runs straight for the door though.
We don't deserve these wonderful animals in our lives, but I'm so thankful we have them.
Thank you,  hadn't thought of that, felt bad when I was scaring her when waking her.
My dog is deaf and I tickle the bottom of his feet to wake him up.
The goodest of boys!!!!
my heart  
my soul
Probably the most beautiful video I've seen on reddit this week
He's so adorable
Wear a fuck ton of gold. Check!
Oh my lord what a cute baby
That happy wagging tail melts my heart.
I just melted into my chair.
As someone who has an older puppy (13yrs) who is losing vision and lost her hearing, this made a light bulb go on about how to wake her up... I always pet her but it always scared her :(
This video makes my heart happier every time I scroll past it. Thank you OP üíó
I have such a soft spot for older dogs and people. They give so much during their lives, and I've seen far too many get treated with less respect than they deserve in their old age, both dogs and humans. If there's ever a time someone (and yes, I refer to dogs as people!) needs compassion and help, it's in their golden years. This video demonstrates that perfectly. 

I lost my 16.5 year old Shih Tzu, Gizmo, on January 2 this year, and he too was deaf and also blind. That little guy taught me more about love, empathy, and loyalty during our years together than I ever would've learned without him. I will be forever grateful to him for making me a better, more caring person. People say they wish dogs could live longer, and part of me does too. But honestly, the pain we feel when we do lose them is so bad, can you imagine saying goodbye to them after 50 or 60 years? 

My heart will forever hurt for the loss of every dog I've had to say goodbye to, but the wonderful memories they give me are priceless, so I continue to not "replace" them, but rather, to replace the loss I feel by getting another one to love. 

I agree with all of the other posters saying we don't deserve dogs because they're too good for us. But I sure am glad that I have them in my life, because they are absolutely one of the best things about my life.
I am sure someone else has said this but I REALLY appreciate that you are so kind to your baby.  I can see that you are careful to wake him up without scaring him because he can't hear you coming.  Give him a cuddle for me.  Awww
This is how we wake up our deaf boy.
Precious.
Read this as "Waking up a dead pup" and was confused for a moment as to why this was on this subreddit
Step 1: Boop him
Step 2: Pet him or be killed
Can we please have more videos of him?
So you know when people say "I literally just watched this 10 times", but didn't actually watch it 10 times. Well, I can genuinely say that I watched it 10 times because that dog is so cute and looks so gentle and sweet. I just want to hug the pup and give it all the love it could ever desire.

Human: Here sniff my finger

Hey! I scritched those ears!
WHO‚ÄôS A GOOD CELEBRITY? WHO HASN‚ÄôT YET FALLEN TO THE TRAPPINGS OF HOLLYWOOD LIMELIGHT?

I'm not dog sign language expert but I think the tail wagging means he is happy.
Such a happy pupper!
Pup has a good snoozle-snoot üëç
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs

This is beautiful. Thank you for sharing.
PRETTIEST CATTLE DOG  I LOVE IT!!!

I do this to my puppy too. They get surprised a lot when they‚Äôre deaf. Her sense of smell is still great though.
Aw what a sweet lil baby girl. That tail wag when she sees it‚Äôs her hooman hits me in the feels.
What a sweetie! üòç
Does he bark? What do his barks sound like?
cutest thing ever, look at that tail wag! happy pup
**WAKE ME UP**
This is so sweetüíü
My oldest dog is 80% blind and at least 95% deaf. She has the soundest sleeps you could ever believe.
Ahhhhh scitches, lovely scitches
"Smells like Love!"
My heart is melting
That‚Äôs so awesome! Obviously your a kind person that has a beautiful doggie üê∂!
Any reason why you went with letting him/her smell you instead of petting him/her
Is that a Rolex presidential?
Is it because they smell you or because they feel the warmth of their breath on your fingers?
So wholesome
Stealth cuddles
That‚Äôs soo cute
Just lightly obstruct airways, works every time üëå
So cute!!
Oh
This will work with any dog tho
I try to see how long I can be in the house before my deaf dog smells me and gets up.
i love him
That's a good pup!
He has the beautiful cookies n cream color üòÇü§£
What a happy pup.
Okay I legit cried. I miss my puppy so much right now üò≠

That was everything I needed and more. What a good boi
Doggo says smells like gold.... ohhh my hooman is here!
I must know the breed.  This looks exactly like my dog, who is a mutt that I haven‚Äôt dared guess the breed of.  No info on the parents at all.

This dog is so sweet!

This made my heart feel so full!
He looks glad somebody so loving is there for him to treat him right
aww he looks so healthy and happy!
My dog has gone deaf as he got old so I woke him up by putting my face right next to his face and apparently I startled him because he punched me in the eye
I want this dog
This just made my day like a million times better
I read this as "waking up a dead pup". I'm both glad and disappointed at this mistake.
He is so precious
I love everything about this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
My heart has melted
That's an extremely good doggo. I'm glad he's got so much love.
Waking up a deaf pup just anyone would any other pup.
So cute
Pls give extra pats for me
My dog also became deaf because of age and i was always unsure on how to wake her up. I think im gonna try this
Is that a Blue Heeler? I had a deaf BH growing up too. She was great with hand commands. So cute!
Edit: spelling
Awe just the scent of his mommy makes him happyüòÑWhat an awesome post
This is making me tear up. :‚Äô)
Awww old puppy üòçüíòüíò
Did u just fart on ur hands and then make him smell it?
thats such a good pupper
We have a deaf St. Bernard. Waking her up is one of my favorite joys in life. Her pure excitement every time is heartwarming.
[deleted]
So sweet
Sweet little thing ‚ù§Ô∏è
**smell my fingers**
This makes me wonder, probably so, if a dog's remaining senses become more effective when one of its other senses has been removed like it does with humans.
I totally get this
Our boy used to be able to hear my car coming when I would get home from work and be ready for me......now I need to go to his crate and flail my arms so he can see I‚Äôm home...üòå
That is aww beyond words.
Tail starts wagging immediately
This is how my 17 year old chihuahua is. Has no idea your next to her until you pet her and the little tail starts going
That pup's tail has gotta be a flamethrower cause it's melting my heart with the way it gets going
Seeing him act like nothing is different is just great. Hope life goes great with him.
Odd question but does a deaf dog make an odd sounding bark?
He's so beautiful
"Awww yisss it's my human! Best day ever already!"
That‚Äôs so sweet and I love them
Awwww
‚ÄúSmell my fingers hehehe‚Äù
I know they love you so much and its funny when you touch there back they jump and look around and then wag. My applehead is deaf.
this makes me so happy
This warms my soul
Awzrwzwzzs, w
So cool!!!
That one will never be able to listen to "Who's a good boy?"
Wow it's just like waking up my hearing pup
best thing I‚Äôve seen all day. 12/10
THE TAIL WAGGING üò≠üíï
Let sleeping dogs lie.
My dog is also deaf and he does this when I wake him up, it's beautiful
I love seeing those little licks my dog does them when hes super comfy.
My dash hound is deaf too
When I was 12, my dad forced me to abandon a deaf pup in the woods. Never forgave him for it.
This takes me back to my deaf pup who passed a couple years ago. So sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love dogs so much.

I am glad that they are not the people who try to kill dogs that are trying to survive
She is the sweetest. The way she reacts melts my heart
What a sweetheart. Looks a whole lot like our Cattle dog x Kelpie called Tasha. She was the best girl ever and lived happily to 24yrs old.

It‚Äôs a pleasure to remember her again today. Thank you kindly for sharing your special friend xx
My heart can't take much more of this cuteness, it's going to melt
Omg I even see the smile.
looks kind of like an AcD‚òÜ‚òÜ
I also have a deaf dog, we wake her the same way, i love how excited she is when she wakes up!
Best dogo
Nice! Dogs live by smell.
I used to stomp my feet when I came home. :,)
S/he wakes up quicker than my laptop from seep mode.
i love everything about this
Yep mine are 16 now, one blind and one deaf. Hand signals  and scent are your best friend.
He's so surprised
What breed is this
This makes my heart hurt it‚Äôs so adorable
We do not deserve dogs, but thank God they don't know that.
My heart what a cute doggo we don‚Äôt deserve dogs
must be hard to have a deaf pup. but still, cute!
Hi, how to you get karma?

This is the sweetest. üíï
i thought he was going to scream in its face then wake it up.

maybe a bit cruel,if the dog wasn't deaf.
Man I love animals
Does its barks sound different?
Mlem. Mlem.
i never saw such tail wag, it's so fast
What a cute dog
What do those fingers smell like? lol
I started teaching our Golden hand signals a couple years ago because our other Golden went deaf.

Too cute
I used to pet sit for a deaf dog and I would wake him up the same way.  He was a sweetie!
This makes me so happy. His wee tail!
Heart officially melted!
Ridiculously adorable.
I just love the fact that "joy" and "excitement" have universal tells for dogs. Like we all can register instantly when any dog is like, "hey, that's my human that I love" at a glance. <3
I love him/her
Good pup.
I love the *pum pum pum* of his tail
Thnx for making my week. Goodbye.
It would be so cool if your dog knew sign language
[That reminds me of something!](https://youtu.be/DKy5gI5P8ak)
What a cutie pie and awesome parent!!
When we become deaf or blind or something similar, our other senses are hightened to compensate for the loss. Dogs already have such powerful sense of smell to begin with. Imagine how even more sensitive that has become... And for the sole purpose of remembering the smell of their hoomans.

I wish I knew to do that before I accidentally scared my old deaf wiener dog before he passed.
Is this good boy a full heeler? I used to have a red mixed one with a puffy tail like that.  I never knew if it was a trait of their breed or something else, it was a very silly foxlike tail :-)  Give your guy an ear scratch for me! I miss mine every day.
I adopted a deaf dog two years ago and he is the best. I'm so happy I found him.
Ohhh goodness my heart ‚ô•Ô∏è
