I wonder how many times the delivery guy did that. Because he KNEW he had to run to escape.
Wait!!! You're delivering me to the wrong address!!!
If he wasn't a cat person before.... He's definitely one now.
I just realized he dropped the kitten at the door and not a package. Too cute!
"LET ME LUV YOU!"
I wish this would loop perfectly so it would look like he tries over and over again, but the kitten runs back to him every time
Once again, a demonstration of how cats choose their human and not the other way around.
When I would deliver mail, I would often get animals who followed me around. Actually, one of my former co-workers adopted a new doggo friend this way. She ended up being a rescue because the owners didn't want her anymore. She followed my coworker for a good chunk of his route, so he asked to keep her.
That's pretty much how people end up with cats.

I've never gotten to pick a cat. My newest cat was a foster kitten for a shelter- but, he ended up being a raging psychopath at adoption events. Lunging and growling at people and that kind of nonsense. Unfortunately, he LOVED me. So, now he's my cat, because I didn't want to do another bite quarantine.
Wait... I didn't sign for it!
Haha why is this so pure and adorable on the mans part?!? Something about a full grown man bringing back a tiny kitten and probably saying “please stay, you’re little and not mine, I don’t want to run you over and I cant take you” is so adorable
After the 20th time....."Fine!  You can come home with me, but tomorrow I'm finding you a new home!"

10 years later:

Wakes up at 5:30am to fur ball pouncing on his face...

Stumbles down the dark hallway towards his kitchen...

Turns on the light...

Plops wet cat food into small bowl on floor...

Almost trips over small creature scrambling down the hallway as he heads to the bathroom...

Later

Receives massive headbutts and purrs from kitteh as he eats his cereal.  Kitteh knows he's not supposed to be on the kitchen table but he loves his hooman so much and when he sees him dressed  in those funny clothes (FedEx uniform) he knows he won't see him for a long time.

His hooman gives him some chin scritches and says "You know, tomorrow I'm finding you a new home!".
Guess the fedEx guy didn’t want to be called a cat-burglar
They need a "beware of cute kitten" sign on that property.
Wait, you can order kittens to be delivered now??
Had this happen to me too.
When i started my first job, i found a tiny kitten at the bottom of our building and fed it. Then it became a habit where she would greet me at the entrance and i would feed her before heading up to work. 1 week in she decided to follow me up to work and thereafter it was a struggle everyday to get away without her following me up. After the third time she followed me right into my office, HR called security and had her relocated :(.

Kitten activated Cutting Corners, this guy doesn’t stand a chance
*I've been standin' here waitin' Mister Postman*
I wanna be that meowsenger. It must feel so good to be chased and loved by a kitty.
AWOLNATION: RUN
Stage 5 clinger I approve of!
I bet kitty is homeless. Who would leave a kitten that age outdoors alone?
i wanna see if hes ok looks like he went under the car / near a tire
Cats should be brought and kept indoors.
Who ordered a cat?
My neighbors cat used to do this.   If she was outside when we were pulling into the driveway she would run over to us.  If we were leaving she would literally jump in our car when we opened the door.  Cute but when you're in a rush it was frustrating!
"Man, being a delivery driver is scary these days."

"Oh shit, do you got the virus? Was some wackadoo attacking you?"

"Nah man, chased by a scary monster."
Run for your life greg.
But did he keep it?!
Looks like hes stealing the kitty in reverse
Don't worry, Meowster! I'm coming!
Kitten: OH, IT’S A GAME!
Stuff it through the letterbox.
I’m actually concerned that this cat was a stray and not a pet bc it is too young to be let out yet if it is an actual pet. So I just hope he really did take the kitteh home or that the people in the home took it in
Plot twist: the kitty actually lives across the street, just trying to go home and the van is on its way...
I wonder if he closed the door in time and tried to drive off but ran over the cat on accident
“Give me all the boxes or you won’t make it meow-t of here alive” was the last thing this poor delivery driver heard.  Feline box addiction is very real and heartbreaking to watch.  If you know a cat suffering from this very real condition, the only known treatment is to keep buying stuff until your house is full of boxes, or your cat may never make it.  -my cats
 Anyone have the full video?
What happened next???... I’d like to think he gave up and took kitty on his rounds :)
That’s a small kitten to be outside alone..
He’s desperately trying to get to the van so he doesn’t accidentally run over the kitten. 
I hate it that the little thing is outside left to be run over.
A cat called Rexie lives up my street and she is super lovely and my friend but that means that she likes to try and follow me home sometimes. It’s got to the point where I have to knock on her owners door and get her inside because I don’t want her walking across roads to try and see where I am going!
A cat is too small to be outside alone.
At first I thought “oh no, he’s going to run it over!!!” And then I got big warm fuzzies from watching him drop and run.

Gotta clap your hands at it and scare it home, little fuzz butt wants to be friends forever.
Having said that, this kitten is too young to be unsecured and not in a safe enclosure if close to a road.   :(
"YOU WERE THE CHOSEN ONE!"
I'd lose that job right there when nothing else got delivered that day.
Adorable!❤️
I just hope the kitten is okay.
Awww poor biddy cat!! I'd have had to call my boss and say I was stuck playing with a kitten till either it fell asleep or the fur parents came home lol if any packages I order aren't on time, this may be one of the excuses I'd accept!
you take that cat and love him  >:(
love this
He just wants to be friends! Lol
so adorable <3
I’m bottle feeding 8 kittens right now and my dad brought his 100 pound dog over who tries to chase off coyotes at my dads. Yesterday a not even 1 pound kitten was chasing him around the house and he was like “what is this little demon!  Get it away from me!”
I'm a bit anxious as the clip ended too early. What became of this kitten? Does it live happily with that family, all cozy, well fed and happy till the end of it's days or did the driver slam into reverse and make it a stain on the driveway?
Involuntary adoption. Accept your fate human
Wait it’s a pregnancy pillow 😂
I didn't know they deliver those.
Get this on r/MadeMeSmile because I’m grinning like an idiot
So precious
aww
Hilarious!😂
No fair. I literally gasped the first time!
Me; dreaming about kittens more and more every day.
Cute!
Some say he's still doing it to this day.
Not so funny meow is it?
I cat not with this. SO. CUTE.
I’d like to think this GIF isn’t looped and he has to keep bringing the kitten back.
LOVE ME!!!!!
This is my dream pet. Unfortunately I ended up with an aloof asshole. I still love her.
The first thing the kitten saw when it hatched was the Fedex guy. This is called imprinting.
I think the messenger is allergic to cats so that's why hes running
It’s Christinith! YOU COME TO MY HOUSE AND YOU PET ME!
What a good boy
Dokomademo **Chase you**
“Oh, god. Not the cat again, RUN RUN RUN RUN!!”
Hahahah now that's cute 🤣😂❤❤
Rumor has it that he’s still attempting to leave that house without his new friend
Dawg - you are CI. This is nice
I know this is a loop, but it makes me wonder how close to reality this actually was....
that's not how you get away from an apex predator :)
Meh.  Just put it in the mailbox.
😹😹
I could watch this forever
I needed this right now 😊
Well there goes the mailman
The dog is so small tho
Game on!!!
I'm glad this will get buried, but I am so tired of seeing cool videos and they only play once.  Some videos give me a play button so that  I can watch them again and some of them just give me the finger, like this one. I'm so sick of it.  I want to see this one again...
Beware of Guard Kitten!
So cute
Damn it man!!! Why would you run away?
Wow hes so little that after he gets far enough you can barely see him on the lawn cam
Cats like vans. I learned this as a service plumber
It’s fast for something the size of a smartphone
Ok, but since when did people started getting kittens delivered to their front door?? Can someone please fill me in as to why a FedEx driver is legit just leaving a live cat outside someone's door as if it's a regular package? Lmao
I want a reality show about mail and package carriers lol
Run!!!
Wait, why did he do this to themselves.
Thtas like my kitty. My sweet girl always wants to know where I am.
This is adorable and that guy is giving me feelings...
They deliver kittens now?
They deliver kittens now?
Wanna ain’t enough.

Wanted plenty last while.  Blip.
As someone who enters residential properties for work I can't tell you how nervewracking it is to drive in/out of the property when pets chase the car around
I want part two
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen today
This is soooo cute!
And that day Fred chose his human
I want the cat to have this deep, booming voice. 

"TAKE ME WITH YOU!"
It took me until my third viewing to realize that he put the cat at the foot of the door at the start of the gif, not a package.
ViCiOus CaT aTtack.
When the "delivery man" realises he does not have a job and is not a delivery man.
Gee, how many times does he bring that cat back
Bet seriously who’s kitten is that? Shits going to get run over. Should’ve hand delivered to owners or something.
Or he is just extremely allergic and doesn’t want to die.
The first time I watched it, I didn't see him carrying the kitten back to the house.  I legit thought that he was delivering a package and then got chased by a kitten and was running for his life.
Cats choose their owners. Guess this kitty chose it's owner.
Just hope he was really, really careful when making his escape in the van....
The cat came back, the very next day...
Had this happen on a job and the more we shoe’d away the more it came to us, so one of the guys started acting like he wanted to see the cat ‘come here pssspsss’ and he effed off in time for us to let the homeowner know and locked the little guy inside
He was probably giggling while running back to the truck
Sweetness is the glue that holds society together.
Kinda dumb tho. He shoulda stayed there with the cat in his arms and waited for the human living there to answer the door. What if they weren’t home? That cat could get into some serious trouble.
Messenger don't go: c
Recently whenever i take my dog for a walk one of my cats keeps following me, and doesnt stop until i walk to the house and let him in
I’d be so afraid to drive in case the kitten got tangled under the wheel
That’s his new kitten. He just doesn’t wanna accept it
The question is, whose time loop is it?
First rule of nature: Running just triggers their instinct to deliver packages.
He even left the door open to have more time to escape
 Lol
fun
I can’t stop watching it.
I don't see what's r/aww about a man literally running for his life from a deadly predator.
This gave me the much needed laugh today. 
Thank you.
Literally me with my housemates kitten atm. I'm allergic but it loves sleeping in my beard and rockets for me every time it sees me.
What kind of human dumps animals?
That FedEx delivery guy just adopted a cat, only he didn't know it then.
That is so cute!!!
Okay, that’s adorable, 10/10
Wait where the fuck is with the feet?
Hes probably scared of running it over when he backs out
"I don't know what that guy is running from, but I don't want it to get me either!"
Wholesome af
That is pretty much how we got our third cat when she was a kitten. Except my husband finally knocked on the door of the house and the lady said it was her cat but she didn’t want her. That was 16 years ago.
Wait, how do I order a kitten to be delivered to me?
Not properly trained for small dogs maybe ?!
You should never show fear when face to face with a wild beast
I had a cat a customer's house hop into the back my work truck.  I finished my job and headed off to my next call and after about 15 minutes on the road I heard meowing in the back.  Had to turn around and deliver a cat.
The beast has been awoken
NOTICE ME SENPAI!!
If I was that driver, I would have taken that kitten home - who leaves a little one like that outside all day!!
This is exactly the kind of probles I want to have. No other.
Man. I drove for Fedex for a few years. I had several occasions of dogs jumping into the truck when I had the door open. Always wholesome. It would make my day.
“Damn, this live delivery tracking stucks for a long time now.”
This made my fricken day!! Thanks OP
Possibly the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen on reddit 😂😂
Why would he run? I’d be late delivering everything else because I’d be petting the kitten
I really needed this today. So freaking cute!
As always, we find that all .gifs are cut off one second early.  Would have liked to see his door close and him back away, leaving the kitten behind.  Here we are left hanging.
This is the wholesome thing I need right now
There's a cat in my neighborhood who does this and he is an absolute angel baby. He'll follow you for a few blocks. I always worry about him getting too far from home so I too have started sprinting away from him like a lunatic.
r/gifsthatkeepongiving
At first I thought he was terrified of the kitten 😂
Just take the kitty with you 😂
Fool. Never run from a tiger. You back away and don't make eye contact.
We had a kitty who loved vehicles. Cat would ride with my mom when she would come pick me up from school, just purring and chilling on the center console. 

One time a plumber was working on something at our house and he left his van open in our driveway. Cat must have climbed in and went to sleep. I finally found her at the local shelter after several weeks. Evidently she rode all the way to the plumber’s warehouse and then was found across the street from there. 

I had to pay $85 to spring my cat from the shelter because she wanted to take a fucking joyride.
Why is a cat that small outside on the porch?
“You’re a little late delivering packages today.

Yeah, sorry, had to keep returning this cute kitten that was following me to my truck”.
I've watched this over and over again and I chuckle every time. You know that the guy looks back as he runs because he knows the kitten is going to come back.

This is also a pretty accurate depiction of me with my cat when I try to go to the bathroom...
YouI don't choose the cat, it chose you.
Awwee😻💙
Hes so loyal
people are such irresponsible cat owners. who just leaves a kitten out in a yard unsupervervised?
Some say the kitty is still running to this day
Dudes pretty tall, put the kitten on the roof or something. Will be fine.
Great video, but why would someone want to leave a little kitten outside while they are not home. You Don't Do that! The kittens safety is so important must be kept indoors
Kitty: Oh what a fun game! Lets do that again!
TAKE ME WITH YOU!
Don't turn your back on a cat and run! Hehe good thing it's a cute tiny cat (:
r/bettereveryloop
I want that delivery please!
Wait hold up excuse me? How the fuck..
I used to play tag with my cat all the time. But he went ahead and matured and left me without a tag partner.
I’m gonna CATch you!!
They say cats pick their humans...

That kitten is yelling "wait, stop.. I want you to be my human"
This is adorable of the delivery guy, but terrible pet ownership. That little baby is going to get run over or hurt eventually.
I wonder why such a tiny kitten is outside like that!
God this is cute. This is needed right now
I had this happen to me except it was a puppy. And then a turkey, except the turkey was definitely not happy chasing us.
What did you say to me???? YOU BETTER RUN!!!!!!
That lawn gives me anxiety
Aww so freaking cute.
At work, taking my break, everyone around me are scared and talking about the riots and everything else going on and I’m just giggling to myself because I love this so much
Shit. I would have taken the kitten. Contact those living at the address later. Probably safer for it.
I thought he put down a package.

&#x200B;

Embrace it sir, that's your friend lol
“Wait! Take me wif you! I luf you!”
Likely the most significant post-Presidential career for an ex-President.
Oof! Close! Lovely! A mini fur torpedo.
My cat is more like a dog. I throw a ball and it fetches it. I think it might have been brought up with dogs prior to adoption
He uses his arms to speed up and it still isn’t enough. ❤️
When you come upon this vid a few seconds in, it looks like a grown man running scared from a kitten.
Watching it again the kitten seems to disappear like it went through a portal once it reaches the asphalt.
Ba dum tss
This is so adorable but who leaves a kitten on a doorstep? Lol I’m a little confused.... that kitty looks like it’s been abandoned before?
Fucking amateur. You drive the cat to the front door then peel it out on their lawn.
I’m just afraid that poor kitten’s going to get in the way of the van pulling out, I can’t get the thought out of my head
Every package delivery comes with a free kitten. Gotta compete with Amazon.
This is 100% r/bettereveryloop
I've had cats try to follow me a few times during pizza delivery. At least for that I can tell the people that their cat is following me and they should probably bring them inside because as cute as it is I can't bring their cat for a drive, and I don't think they want their cat out who knows where.
RUN....dun nu nu na
Fuck, those are the problems I need.
Day 37 and I’m still watching this on repeat
Thank you fren - you’re saying.”
And then he accidentally ran it over
After scrolling through so many posts in r/all about how shitty everything is currently going. This made me smile.
*Accidentally runs over cat*
He isn't running, that's his sidekick. They have more deliveries to do.
I needed this laugh so much!!!  Thank you. Prayers for the delivery guy and hope he got away safely 😀
This is kinda sad tbh
Lol, I wish my cats were half as needy. I have to bargain with two of them just to scratch their backs.
I hope the right thing was done.
“Come back here, Hooman!”
You can't escape man lol!
Wouldn’t be the worst way to go
Nah didn’t wanna see that either


https://youtu.be/jqDGK_UjfFI
Thank you for this.
This kind of breaks my heart
I wouldn't be able to run away from him. Poor kitty!
Was he really trying to leave the cat on somebody else’s doorstep😫
*Are you my delivery driver?*
This is wholesome af
I wanted to say thanks for this I’m very very depressed tonight and this made me laugh out loud so cute omg
He didn’t ring the doorbell?
Kitty has chosen amazon
Why is he running in fear from a kitten? Allergies???
Maybe he’s a “Sleepwalker” from the [hilariously bad 90’s film?](https://youtu.be/-MtIoh8iS7c) 

(They were Lovecraftian horrors whose only praeternatual predator was cats. The film ends about the way you’d expect, but with more flames. The incest was a surprise too.)
Lol
I wish my cat would be screaming
A wild Palico is on the hunt!
I do that anytime a cute boy pays me the slightest attention when I’m at the gym... I am not proud of myself.
Awwwww, lonesome kitteh!!
That hustle though
Great
Probably the best conundrum you could possibly encounter.
LET ME LOVE YOU
Start the car! START THE CAR!
I needed this right now
Does anyone have any context for this???
They deliver kittens now? So cool.
I just imagine that cat being like the T-1000, chasing the van down the street, jumping on the back and digging it's claws in...
What’s the back story here. the mom cat ordered kitten food on Amazon?
That's what I do when I don't want my cat in my room
I NEED ANSWERS
That cat has chose you sir 💁😁
Awww, maybe it was meant to be.
I WISH I could be a delivery driver. I wish I could have done that but driving scared me.
wow cute
“Are you my mother?” The second mom that runs out of that kittens life 💔
Amazon is stepping up their game
He almost died.
And then he unknowingly drove over the kitten and now it's dead, like you dreams and ambitions in life, good day sir/mam.
Kitty super fast lol
*dying of cuteness levels*
I thought it was a play on Brisingr and was waiting for the van to burst into flames.

&#x200B;

Drive drive drive!!
This is too pure for this world.
Hahahaha.. cutest thing ever!
Notice me, send-pai!
SO that's how you get a cat?
i'd love for this baby to be delivered to me too ahahaha!
Shoulda put the little kitty in an empty box with on the step.
I spent about few minutes trying to understand what is "senger". 😐 Haha
I smell a PIXAR movie coming out of this....

"RUN AWAY!" coming to a theater near you May 2022.
He should have just left a spare box.. the kitten would have eventually just sat in it so he could leave.
This is Fake News. FedEx is not capable of gently putting something down in front of a door.
He just wants pats. lots of pats.
Why do I get the feeling this happens at least once a week?  😂😂😂
Why is he putting the cat there I'm confused
Cat "Yeah put me down, annnnd here I come! yeah this is fun... wait what are you... I cant run, that fast! stop! but... we were playing..."
That's an awful breakup
It gets better every time
STOP BABY LOVES YOU!!!
Im imagining if there was sound, he would be screaming in fear. :)
When the next house comes with a mini-boss.
RUN MORTAL
Plot twist: It's not a looping gif and the delivery guy is still trying to escape
"Get back here, slave!"
I awwed so hard at this, what the heck
This is SO cute!!!  That kitten has adopted him and won't stay away!  🤣❤
Oh shit, who delivering cats?
I hope he was able to drive away without running over the kitten, poor thing is just too fast haha
At least the kitten is just wanting to be his friend he turns an runs away😊
He got into the car and drove away? cruelly!
The cat actually wants to devour the soul of the guy.
I just realized that he’s putting the kitten down 😂
Where is my catnip, mailman? WHERE IS IT!!?
Now, what did the NEIGHBORS witnessing this think?
No wonder my orders were always delivered late...
I don't think this driver realizes he has a pet cat now.
I hope this isn't a video of somebody dumping their kitten and running off.... :P
So cute!!!!!

Mail men are scared of dogs and fed ex is scared of cats?
Is that even where the kitten lives tho might've just wandered up
If only driver training had covered this situation!
Zoom
Absolutely heartbreaking.
[deleted]
Big dog small package .
😂 😂 😂
Since when are cats this loving?
That's actually not funny. The dude may have a genuine fear of cats or animals and he may be terrified out of his mind in this video.
This was the same house that amazon worker was caught taking a piss on the driveway wasn’t it?
