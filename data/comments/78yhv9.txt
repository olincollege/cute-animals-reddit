It's so cute it hurts me
I don't know what to do about this level of cuteness. I want him. 
‡ªí(‚óê ·¥• ‚óâ)‡•≠
"Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to maybe go walkies with me?"
If I were this cute, maybe some of those crushes would amount to something...!
Not to be dramatic but I would die for this puppy
[deleted]
**WHY ARE YOU NOT PETTING THAT DOG**
This huge level of bug-eyed cuteness and waggly tail... I'm crushing hard on this delightful lil' pup!
So cute!! Also, coincidentally, I'm available as a rebound...
That's me when I'm clubbing
Tail don't lie.
WHAT AM I FEELING?!?!
My fucking heart. Ouch oof owie
That wink towards the end. I'm dead. 
This is me with every person I find attractive.
I will give everything to have this little guy .... so cute 
Just commenting so I can find this tomorrow to brighten my day.
This pup changes breeds if you watch closely. 
Something about this dog makes me think he's happy.  Don't know why.   I can't put a finger on it, it's moving too fast.
That's me when I get into an argument with the family and I'm in the corner watching everyone eat.
i strongly identify with this lil pup 

^pls love me 
This pup is nervous as hell
So adorable.
That dog's looks like he's "whale-eyeing" - usually associated with severe stress/fear. Not what I'd call a cute moment.
He looks like an animal straight from a Studio Ghibli movie
If Samuel L Jacksson were a dog
My hearth is literally liquid right now
Cuteness fuckin overload!
I love how as his nervousness grows, so does his wall-eyedness. Irresistible little fellow.

when you've been bred with malformed eyes and head because man's best friends' best friend values your looks over your health. 
*breathing problems intensifies*
[removed]
It's eyes are WAY too big for its skull.  Dog breeders have a lot to answer for.
[deleted]
If you love animals, stop getting these dogs so we can stop breeding them.
Pug mix? 
I don't want to be the negative nelly here but, there is something about these sorts of dogs that weirds me out a bit.

I think it's the eyes. It's both cute but also a bit freaky like a fish.
Where do I pick him up? I need answers now.
He was probably scared of someone standing behind you at the moment of recording, watch out dude, you never know who's living with you in your house.
I was waiting for its eye to pop out.
Cutest googly eyes i've ever seen.
It‚Äôs so cute I can‚Äôt take it
I'd do anything to just carry that sweet little pup around with me wherever I go
what did we do to wolves. the eyes are so distorted it's grotesque.

stare at the eyes and tell me that's normal or even desireable, it's like admonishing you for failing it's genome.
I love the fucked up eye twitch at the very end that shows the level of uncomfortableness he's willing to endure to get closer.
The reflection of the lights on his eyes remind me of cuphead's eyes
I threw up a little, but in a good way.
So..    essentially how April looks at Andy in Parks and Recs? 
I'm in physical pain because this is too cute. 
I wish I looked this cute talking to my crush!
Does the dog have a crush on two people?
I melted 
I want that pup!
awwww the tail waggling gets faster and faster....the eyes, they hurt my heart
Aww! That‚Äôs so much cuter than going home and then masturbating and crying
u/discipleofoden
Those eyes though.
It is super cute. That expression, totally loved it 
For Christ's sake,  somebody hug that damn puppy!
Sure would be nice if people had an obvious "tell" like a tail wag. 
I honestly had to fight the urge to say ‚Äúhi baby‚Äù in an obscenely high pitch voice
such a cute pickle!
This is way to pure for my heart
Omg someone pet him already !!

Pugs are awesome, but having owned 3 in my lifetime I would never get one again. They develop so many different health problems through their lifetime and are so expensive to keep healthy. Purebred dogs nowadays is a freaking roulette wheel with the degraded genetics from over/inter-breeding
Pugs are so ugly to me
This is why shelter animals should be adopted before purebred ones
10/10 would go on a date with pupper.
That poor dogs eyes are going to pop out of its head.
That's some ugly ass dog. 
This is exceedingly adorable!
Me looking at everything I want but know I can't have.
PET‚úãÔ∏èTHEü§öDOGGO
Interesting fact: When elephants see humans their brains show increased activity in the same regions as ours do when we see puppies.

I‚Äôm assuming they make an exception for the humans currently poaching them to extinction with AKs.
IS SOMEBODY GONNA PET THAT DOG OR WHAT
Heart meltingly adorable!
TIL that I'm a pug 
Or your cokeyed and dont know if your looking at me or the cat on the table...
Pet the dog before he thinks y'all are assholes for just staring at his lonely
Cute self. 
Wow, ugly! Breathing problems incoming. That ‚Äúbreed‚Äù should be banned
Cutest little pug ever! 
What kind of dog is this, it's so cute.
I may be psychologically broken. Used to see this stuff and it would bring a smile to my face, now it damn near brings a tear. Thinking about all the other little puppers out there so cute and innocent living horrifying lives, dying every day. Sorry to darken your mood :(
Someone pet and cuddle that dog right now 
What dog breed is this cutie?
****WHITE GIRL SCREAM****

I     C A N ' T     E V E N ! !
If I were that adorable-- that would be nervously checking you aren't trying anything funny. Stay BACKKK
When I am me. 
About covers it..

Look at those eyes! 
Awwwww
So precious!<3
This is the cutest shit I've ever seen
Like I really want to talk to you, but the same time.. no
This amount of cuteness aimed at you can completely ruin your life....
*CUTENESS OVERLOAD*

ME
YOU ADOPT THAT PUPPY NOW!
Is this just a head with two paws and a tail? This dog does not seem real.
Hands down the cutest little pup I've seen!
Are his eyes moving independently of each other?
Or when you don't have a crush on someone but you have a lazy eye, so it always looks like you're crushing on the person to your right.

*crying profusifies*
I wish we had tails that could in a non threatening way show we were interested in someone 
I've never wanted to hug something as bad as I do right now.
Somebody smooch that little thing ffs

Same.
r/disneyeyes
You pet him right now!
My cherry tart just melted

I'm left extremely unsatisfied that I didn't see anyone pet him at the end.
When I look at this picture it looks like he‚Äôs in a microwave
The cuteness is overpowering, just take the damn upvote 
It looked like he was about to give a little growl then a woof...was kind of waiting for it.
f**k you OP. take this upvote! 

edit: no bad words. 
Awe.  Every doggy and kitty are beautiful.  Awe. This little puppy should have a life of love and treats.  Lots of treats.  Awe. 
Why do certain dog breeds have lazy eyes
Someone find this pup a body!
I wish anyone would look at me like that! 
Oh my god that thing is fucking precious.
Cute little guy!

Looks like it's made of chocolate and slowly melting in a microwave
Love me!!!
Reminds me of the girl from the INCREDIBLES, the sister
That animal's crush should blow a rape whistle
Sooooo damn adorable 
Omg sooooo cuuuuute it hurts my heart! 
Cuteness over 9000, can't stand it. 
Derp
<3
Baby Falkor is soo cute:)

phone home
This is so accurate. Now i just need to ask someone out...
Me irl
Aww
Well damn.
If a dog at a shelter ever did this to me; I would all of a sudden have a new dog. 
Oh my god he is adorable!
It looks like it will explode any second.
Ow. My. Heart... 
This post just sold ten thousand puppies. 
"Please pet me while I sink down into my car buffing sponge bed."
...and you try to sniff them a little...
This is too fucking cute
That's just too cute I might die
What a beautiful pup, this made my day :‚Äô(
oh how nice
Someone please animate the comedic misadventures of this cartoon pup trapped inside our live-action world.
The facts that its a scared puppy makes it more true lol
Awww so cute!!!!
Oh my gosh! Look at that face... I can only but imagine how I felt tryiny to tell her how sorry I was....... Can I get  some dipers? I am soaking tears already.
Whatta QT!
This is the look my dog gives me when she wants to lick my face, needless to say she usually gets to lick my face 
Awwww the wagging tail <3
He's sooooo flippin' cute!!!
What pokemon is this?
/u/hradloff12 
Heart...can't take...that faaaaaace!
Oh no! It‚Äôs melting away!!
I cannot handle this
Do these dogs have some form of lazy eye?
Omg. I love him. 
Be still my beating heart!
Oh my goodness!
If I could upvote this a thousand times then I would <3
He's just a little guy!!! :D :D :D 
awwww
So adorable!!! I couldn‚Äôt handle all that cuteness :)
I heavily relate to this, except that pupper is way cuter than me
It's the tail wag that I have trouble with.
Me_irl
He's so ugly, he's cute.
I literally just told my coworker five minutes ago that I have a crush on her. I get on reddit and this is the first thing on my feed. What are the odds! 

P.S she said " I already knew. Sorta" don't know if that's good or bad. This is why I never say anything :( 
Hinata
awww
I'm too afraid! I'm going to have to move and get a new job and new life! Why me :( 
Little guy is adorable
This is called "whale eye". Dogs display this when they're nervous or afraid of you. 
you know that moment in a lava lamp where the wax finally gives and just blobs? I just felt my heart doing that while watching this.
Cuteness overload.
If you pretend the dog is being microwaved it‚Äôs a waayyyy less cute video. 
Omg I died
Id bite that cute little fucker head off.
Man there are a lot of dog experts in this thread 
I love how this pug actually looks like it's from a 1930s cartoon.
No one will ever look at me the way they look at this pup
Awe, I want to hug him & squeeze him & call him George
Omg.
I just melted
I had to put my heart in a freezer after looking at this, because my heart melted
How is this even a real living thing?
That might be the cutest damn thing ive ever seen!
What is that thing and what's wrong with it's eye?
Marvin the Martian!
Oh my God. I'd just pick him up and walk out of there and we'd never be heard from again.
Ah if only I was this adorable, maybe then I'd have a solution with my shyness 
How is this me tho
Marty Feldman is back! As a dog though. 
I'm married. So that's more like when she is the only one with a Drumstick ice cream come left.
Ahh, I'm a sucker for pugs. So cute
The eyes remind me of Samuel L. Jackson. 
Oh my god dis tew muh
It's like I'm watching him transform.
Falcor ?
Aweeee. This is making me miss my childhood pug Leilani, also black and adorable. She still lives with my parents but her little face is all grey now.
Aaaaw<3 
Puppy Melt
Why do dogs do this? Mine does the same thing, he'll barely look me in the eyes when I get on his level, but his tail's wagging like crazy. If I'm standing over him or a distance from him, he'll stare me dead in the eyes, but as soon as I get close, he looks away. I jokingly say he's bashful, but what's the real answer?
You can't help but say "Awwww..." So freakin' cute! Can this puppy be my keychain so I can bring it everywhere I go? *puppy eyes üê∂
I liked this before I saw the actual gif because... PUPPPPIIIEEEEEESSSS
Does it not creep anyone else out that this thing blinks one eye at a time?
Looks like every anime MC ever
Don't shy buddy
Black Pugs are the best. Had one as a kid he lived for 11 years. Still miss that little guy.
Those innocent and cutest eyesüòáüòá
Looks like its  mom married her brother

aw so cute!
My heart just fell out of butt. 
I hope you gave it a forever home
lol so true.
For the first half second, I thought the puppy was in the microwave. Don't microwave puppy!
Omg this is so fucking cute 
Reeeeepost 
So adorable!!
This dog lowkey looks like Kendrick Lamar.
I just want to pet him!!! I wont rest easy until i see him get petted!
be positive 
This is how I imagine Samuel L Jackson must have been asking someone to prom
when we are hungry we look like as
Just kill me
hoi, can pls go get shmackos tugedhar? 
And when you are bug eyed*
Someone pet that goddamned dog already!!!
Awwww can I have him?‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Me currently 
And, you're cute
With those big, cute puppy-dog eyes, it looks like something from a cartoon! So cute!
Just melts your heart

This dog is an accurate representation of me 
This is some seriously weapons grade cuteness.
and that someone is holding a cookie. there's no way there wasn't a cookie out of the camera shot!
Cute puppies are cute, I love this video. You agree with thumb up.
The tail tells it all! Wouldn't it be great if we could read humans just as easily?! 
He look like he got googly eyes
That is whole lot o' cute.
Literally impossinle for dogs to get any cuter weve reached the limit
I can‚Äôt even.... 
Those big eyes!    That was adorable.   
While I understand the need to seperate animals at shelters, it is fucking *heartbreaking* to see single puppies like this. 

They are *not* prepared to handle being alone. They're still very much social animals, and babies, to boot.
Yeah, that‚Äôs me right now.  ;(
This is the Marcel the Shell of dogs
Not to be dramatic but I would fu*king die for this puppy 
This is literally so god damn cute it almost hurts
Story of my life 
I like how the blinks are seperate for each eye 
Story of my life 
What breed of piglet is this with eyes that big?
This is the most precious thing I have ever seen. Seriously, does it get any more helpless and innocent and pure then this?
But when I show a girl how *happy* I am to see her...I mean I exactly have a tail sooo
Shy but have a crush ? That was on /r/askreddit yesterday !
Well, this is about the cutest thing I've ever seen.
He looks more guilty than shy.. but super cute!!
I said aww before hand 
That thing is gross
Are you about to make puppy burritos?
That thing is hideous. 
This is my exact situation right now. Except I don't have those glorious eyes to do anything about it. I'm comfortable in the shadows.
That wink üòâ tho! 
That's me
Omg so cute
Love those eyes, and the little tale wag.
I thought this was a cat at first.
Is this a chihuahua?
700
The true definition of r/aww
is it me or does this cutie look like he's sitting in a microwave?
The feels are coming In.
Puppy dog eyes IRL.
I love how it blinks its eyes separately. 
Wish we had tails so that we can let our crushes know we adore them instead of doing the awkward walks and the shitty talks...
Remember when reddit used to get angry at posts with these kinds of dogs because of health problems? lol
I usually do this while eating garlic pickles in front of her
Must...resist...the... SNUGGLE!!!!11!!1!!
It looks like an alien lol
be still my beating tail
Aww
I'm so happy
omg kill me
üòÇ
Is it wrong I want to put his face in my mouth...nom nom 
Melts my heart 
God DAMN IT my life is rudderless but when I see a cute animal I‚Äôm like ‚ÄòI will find a profitable profession and make bank just to keep you in good health and happiness‚Äô and this shit doesn‚Äôt really happen with babies (maybe if I have one myself but then why would I get all twisted over other people‚Äôs dogs) and I just wanna know WHY we‚Äôve been made this way is it some evolutionary thing or learned?
u/solynx3 those eyes!
My roommate's dog does that except that's when she is peeing on the carpet at the same time.. cute but ugh...
He looks like he's about to explode with happiness
Why are people cursed with shyness? 
Moving into your dm's like....
This is so cute it makes me want to throw up in a good way. I don't know how else to describe how I'm feeling right now 
Oh.my.lord.  Cuteness overload!
SOMEBODY PET THIS PUPPY RIGHT NOW! 
WHO IS THIS 
My. Fucking. Heart.
LOOK AT THE INNOCENT FLOOFER üò≠üò≠üò≠
Oh my *god*
This is me every time I would meet a cute guy while I was in university 
so adorable it made my day <3
Damnit...to cute......
I am a 47 year old biker and this brought tears to my eyes
sooo cute!! :O
This level of cuteness is actually harmful.
Yes
Aww, Nibbler.
My front tail wags with a similar ferociousness 
Cute cat üêæüêæüêæüêà
Omg breaks my heart I miss my black pug Hurley so much
So damn cute
You broke me reddit, thank you
[It's... A spawn of Falcore?](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B_YwYcKU8AETX-P.jpg)
Don't you eyeball me boi!
That‚Äôs literally what I look like
Words cannot express the joy I feel when I see this little guy, especially the way his/her back arches in anticipation of a pet.
I don't normally comment on awww stuff but God damn is that dog cute. That made me giddy
I love seeing these adorable baby puppies because I remember the recent post of someone having to put their service dog of 16 years down and I like to think babies like this could be reincarnations of them... just a little comforting notion.
Has a huge crush 
I LOVE YOU PUPPY!!  
Mildy creepy, slightly adorable. I'm so confused.
This is what a newborn luck dragon looks like.
Cuphead inspiration?
When you see your fetish in public, but doesn‚Äôt want to be seen as a weirdo
Thank god they started non pure breeding pugs. Breathe well lil one 
Wy u put it in a microwave tho?
Thi is too much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
so cute!
Engage cuteness thrusters to maximum power!

Every guy in High School 
And your crush is your best friend and you want to make the first move but you also don't want to ruin your friendship...
In terms of anime, I think of Hinata
No one posting because we all know how it is ü§ó
So what happened afterwards??
*wagging intensifies*
my heart is literally wanting to hug this pup and eat it and also kiss it...am i going crazy!!
This is pure gold !!!
This dog is a goldfish
I think thats the ugliest cute dog Ive ever seen.
You better have taken him home.
Is it just me, or does this puppet look like Peter Dinklage?
I‚Äôm gonna cry aaawwwee
The eyes are like those googly ones you stick on things.
My goodness...could those little eyes get any bigger?!
Whaat a cutie pie! üòä
Too much cuteness!
I can relate to...
üëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄüëÄ
The need to just reach in my phone and show this pupper some heckin lubbin... too much. üòç
now if only i was that cute
some things are just adorable
this is dangerously cute
puppies like this start wars
It is satisfying to watch this post
What is this ??? How this can be ? It's too cute for... Idk!!! It's too damn cute! 
Pet him you monster
I am exploding in awwwwwwwwwwwwwwh!
Omg 
SO cute...
Thanks OP.

When trying to be coy.
"W-Wanna go get some schmackos together?"
adorable
My heart 
Poor little pup is scared
I used to attend a tennis camp where I met this kid I was absolutely in love. I was way too shy to say anything. I got ahold of his AIM and he informed he was well aware of my obsession and thought I was cute. With any luck I imagine this is how I would stare at Him.... all those feelings.... ah to be young again 
<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3<3
The wink was the best part
If this dog were human, he would have been arrested for looking at someone like that
It's too hot in there. This poor dog is obviously melting.
I can‚Äôt breathe 
Me at work... 
I'm sorry but why do I want to eat her. And squeeze until she pops. Ugh going straight to hell.
this is a heckin cute pupper
It's adorable, but also kinda sad. Looks like the little guy is sitting in a cage hoping to get adopted. Hope he did.
Toooooo cccuuutttteeeee!!!!

This made me happy üòÅ!
MEIRL
As long as i am this cute its ok i guess
He looks like Flava-flav.
IS SOMEBODY GOING TO PET HIM OR WHAT
Aww black beauty 
‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ÄùAaaaaaaaawwwwwweee sooo cute!‚Äù Is the only proper response to this.
What breed 
Not a dog person, but I would go John Wick for this pup!
O yes! She has come.. but how should i reach her to talk. Yes.. yes.. she is looking at me.. i think she likes me too. :-)
7k karma to 100+k in a day
That is the cutest fucking thing I‚Äôve ever seen!
Me irl
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying... I hope this cute little guy has a good home, the metal cubicle he‚Äôs in made me think he‚Äôs in a shelter and now I‚Äôm sad üò¢
I feel like I'm losing a little bit of manliness each time I watch this loop.
Haha cuteness overload!!! 
Everything with pugs gets an upvote :)

That's... that's some kind of singularity dog. It goes all the way through cute to sort of creepy for me. My gut reaction was "What in the world is that thing? It looks like Betty Boop's dog-boyfriend."
so lovelyÔºÅ
It's a lot more creepy when a bearded man in their late twenties does this... I'm told.
can I have that?
This made my morning so much better.

Such a sweet pup!
Too cute
Ok, can I have 20 right now pls
All the righteous indignation about pugs on here is absurd. A) They‚Äôre not in constant pain. That‚Äôs obviously bollox. They‚Äôre as happy and good natured as any other dog you‚Äôll meet. More than most. Who gives a fuck if they snore? So do most humans. B) If you have an issue with dogs being specially bred for aesthetic purposes then euthanise your own dog and go out and buy a fucking wolf. 
I think my heart is melting. 
I could watch this all day!
It‚Äôs the Hinata of dogs
When you are Marty Feldman and you are looking at anything. FTFY
Oh my goodness. Too cute 
Seems like a funko pop. 
I had a dog like this. Think it was a collie/pug cross... Dude would melt my heart with that look. Sady, I had to give him up because my job did not allow the amount of time needed for companionship for him.

I recall my first experience of reverse sneezing he had. Poor thing sounded like he was about to die. After a few time he finally figured out to come to me so he could lay in my lap as I petted him to calm him down.

Dang it I miss him now.
In my house, that dog would get away with absolutely anything.
Oh my God! I just can't!! Adorbs!!
Comments here are rough, damn. If you're arguing that we should figure out a way to make these breeds more healthy at the cost of cuteness, I'm cool with that. If you're saying that these animals shouldn't exist because they're a product of man, remember that almost all dogs are a product of man and many breeds have health issues.
Source: healthy pug owner
Shit, I am so sorry you had to go through that. And the dog, but that goes without saying. My friend‚Äôs pug (She‚Äôs 5 years old) is thankfully still free of any ailments, except for an ear infection one time. But I really hope pug breeders will start taking more responsibility for the health and well-being of these dogs soon, because this sort of thing is just awful. 
To think, that thing is not too far descended from wolves. 
Anybody else see a relation to Spyro?
Reminds me of Mitty for some reason
Comment to find this later.
OMG can I meet this dog plz...
r/DisneyEyes
So true
Sady, I had to go through that.
Hey we‚Äôre on the table...
YOU HUG THAT PUPPER RIGHT NOW
Omg so cute and accurate 
It won't play on my screen? Anyone have a link to the gif?
I can't see the video. 
THIS DOG IS SO UGLY! I LOVE IT!
i hope he gets the life he deserves, honest loving and luxurious, animals are the best thing on this planet.

This is adorable!!!
I think this is the best thing on reddit
Hey, that dog has a lil bit of exopthalamus....  u might want to check for hyrdrocephalis, it‚Äôs pretty common in dogs.  I mean, it‚Äôs usually not a big deal but it‚Äôs good to know 
I‚Äôve got a crush on this pupper now. 
I'm probably overthinking it but the horrifying shit I've seen people to do get their animals do to something for a picture puts r/aww in a different light for me. Seen a handful of horrifying gifs on this sub when animals were obviously abused to make them look sad for whatever reason. The before and after ones are the worst. "This is my dog when I abuse it" " this is my dog with food infront of his face". 
 Those eyes are adorable!
When you've been so recklessly bred that you'll probably die early and painfully*
My gawdd, that "we don't deserve dogs" quote has never been so true! We don't deserve this much purity üò¢
That's one ugly ass bug
This is the most aww.
Ultimate smol!
Put it down
this turned my insides to the consistency of mashed potatoes. I'm almost angry how cute it is and that inevitably someone or something will hurt this adorable creature in some way it doesn't deserve
Vet Tech: Best job in the world
When your animal's spirit animal is a soft taco topping
Keep wanting to squee and pet him, but screen gets in way :(
Ill be that guy... its wagging its tail because its scared and being submissive. Still cute but in a product of evil sort of way.
Pug?
Oh. My. God.
so cuteeeeeee
those eyes üòÇ
Cute but the poor thing probably can't even see right. It's wall eyed. Some of these dogs are mutants from all of the human tampering in dog reproduction.
peter dinklage vibes 
The wagging intensifies when has full vision of hooman.
I‚Äôm off to cuddle my puppers..
Pugs doesn't get much love. I want to adopt one, their such good dogs, their ugly looks drive people away, I find them really good doggos though.
Ok well I'm fucking dead, this is cute as fuck
You can tell how selective breeding has fucked up dog breeds
According to the liberal media, looking at people unwantedly is sexual harrassment, so this little pupper better be careful.
Oooor when your face is disformed! :)
it's so damn adorable!! the fact that the eyes might pop out oddly makes it cuter!
Its the perfect mix of ugly and cute.
This little guy is in my favorites.

Got them anime eyes! üëÄ
OH. EM. GEE!!!!!

Puppers gets ALL the kissus!
What kind of pooch is this?
for the love of god, someone pet that doggo!
If I went to a pet store just to look/play (which I frequently do) and saw this behind glass there is ZERO fucking chance I walked out without it
Me and the Misses fostered one of these for a couple of weeks. Sooooo cute but man bites everything. Damaged the bed frame, table, my recliner, and bunch of shoes. If he didn't get adopted I would 100% kept him.
Does anyone know the breed? 
I love him! So cute... His cuteness is off the chart. Is the pup a boy or a girl? What's the pups name? We need answers! A virtual puppy cam on this lil' fella would be good. 
This is my prn account but this is the cutest thing I've ever seen
except with more anxiety-vomiting. 
squeeeeee!!!
SOMEONE GIVE THIS PUPPER SOME PETS
Maybe I'm more depressed than I realize.. or maybe this world's gotten a bit colder and we just aren't as kind to one another as we should be these days.. but this cartoonishly perfect, precious pupper is feels for the weary heart. 

Thank you so much for this. I'll be revisiting this every so often. 
Adorbs overload!
Little dogs aren't cute at all! 
My Pug's eye occasionally pops out when she's getting a bath..but the lil bugger DGAF
This time I‚Äôm not quoting Borat, but seriously what kind of dog is this? NEEEED.
Love the little lazy eye, my pit has that same thing its pretty adorable
I kind of want to squeeze him/her until those big ol‚Äô eyes pop! Not really, but I want to cuddle this pup until one of dies.
When you were born a dog but identify as an ugly-fish...
Ugly fuckin dog
Unfortunately i‚Äôm not that cute. 
Not pictured: The sad, desperate whining of my soul *and* my sinuses.
What the fuck is that? 
Been a redditor for 1 year. To many more years of shit postingüçæ
We finally did it! We can stop inbreeding now.
Still don't understand why humans kill and eat 50 million animals a day
LIttle guy can be gender neutral.
Those dopey eyes!
He has DEFINITELY been taking cuteness lessons. I feel like holding up a card with a 10 on it. 
cutest pupper ever
He‚Äôs just a little woofer :)

Between this post and the one where the dachshund has the toblerone I am trying to determine what is the cutest of all time.  Among them I think!

So cute it nearly kills you!   Oh the Dachshund has a bowtie too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB_e008IqIo
still this little one is just so darn cute.. I don't know how to choose!
Whoever took that has more willpower than me. The moment that tail started wagging that pupper would be assaulted by ear tussles and belly rubs
That‚Äôs me rn. Just asked a girl out. And I did it thru message! Ugh. She replied but I‚Äôm too anxious to check and see what she said.. 
‚ÄúYes can I please get 20 of these guys to have a snuggle fest with?‚Äù 

Will be the first thing I say if I get into heaven 
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt help it but I loooooove youuuuu!‚Äù Ahh ommg
It's always gona be easier for girls tho üëå
Is there a way to upvote this more than once? I‚Äôm going to make multiple accounts now just to do this. This is by far the cutest thing I have ever seen!
Dude...
I just want to hold him. He's too sweet!
Pet him! Rite Naaoooww
My dog every time I eat something in front of her
I think I died.
This is so cute that it physically pains me.
I too wag my tail when I have a crush on someone.  It seems to work better for this little one. 
That pupper is melting! 
I want one 
Why is the doggo melting?!?!
Puggy puggy puggy.  So cute and sweet.
Holy shit. This is so adorable it made my ovaries quiver.
Me, in dog form, attempting to ask for a number.

Shyness can feel crippling at times, I feel for this goodboye
Breed?
