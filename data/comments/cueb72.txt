You know that’s worth two in the bush.
When I was in middle school, my mom let me take home a baby bird that was being eaten by ants. He was all pink. He grew up to be one of these birdies. We named him Peggy. My mom raised him because I was in school most of the day, so she fed him and what not. Peggy lived with us for years, we had some square light bulb covers that hung over and he would nest there. What I loved is that you would whistle and he would come to you. We even took him to the Corpus Christi beach and he made it back home with us. Eventually, Peggy began to fly out the house when we would open up the door (we squished him a few times :/) keep in mind he had his outside time, so this was different. He would always come back, but one day he didn't. We theorize it was the same bird that nested on our pillar outside, but that dude never responded to a whistle so it was just wishful thinking. I love these birds.
bird cannot fast travel when enemies are nearby
😢 GO ON NOW, GIT! 😢
*"Look, you may not WANT to be a Disney princess, but I don't make the rules, ok??"*
"That was fun throw me again!"
If something loves you, it will come back..
Before I realized tis was /r/aww, I was expecting the bird to plummet. Very happy to be wrong.
“Lol oh whoops!! Almost dropped me! Must be careful!”

“Why is my nest launching me?” -Bird, probably.
Story, please?

And do the rudraksha beads figure into the story?
Congratulations on your new pet bird!
And if it won't leave your hand...take it home and feed it treats.
And if it comes back, it's yours forever.
"No thanks the weather is cold and your hand is quite warm".
And if they come back, you’ll know it was meant to be.
This is going to make it very difficult to pee or feed yourself

or shake hands.
Yours forever ❤️
Go Toriyama and teach a dinosaur to ride a ball.
That bird loves you for real

It chose you
Poor bird is wondering why it's nest keeps yeeting her.

Congrats you are now a Disney Princess.
You may or may not be a Disney princess
No human, I’m cozy here. Air cold. Hand warm. I sleep now.
I was actually expecting it to not fly and just flop in the mud
Did you have the bird when it was born? This looks like a result of imprinting. It is the cutest little thing though!
That hand bird is worth about two bush birds
If it comes back it is yours, if not it was never meant to be.
You are now a Disney princess 👑
What Butterfree should've done
I'm so jelous, you've been chosen
You are now officially a Disney princess. Now start singing.
This bird must use Reddit and has seen all the release videos of squirrels and birds being eaten immediately after by cats and other animals.
The nuzzle into the hand omg
And if it loves you, it will come back. >w<
That's the sweetest thing I have ever seen on Reddit. Those cute eyed cats and dogs, that's our pareidolia but that's true love
OP have you considered keeping him/her and having some sort of out door access for it. Did you raise it? What’s the back story? Did you set it free?
I've never gone aww for this long before in my life

Awwwww so cute!!!
You are chosen !
It's the new boomerang... birderang
Doesn't this mean it's become too reliant on you? So basically you have to keep it
That’s fine. *gronk spikes little birdie into the ground*
That's a birbarang; the most notable characteristic of the species is it always comes back to you
There's an italian poem about exactly this:
"Non dico: ‚Ti amo, ti voglio, sei mia, sono tuo.‘ 
No, io amo come se tenessi un bell’uccello nella mano aperta. 
Ti dico: ‚Vola, se hai il desiderio di esser te stessa, rimani, se vuoi.‘"
"Oh...um..no thank you."
The super power I always fantasize about
If you love something, set it free.

  
*If it comes back to you, it is yours.*
Bitch! Quit throwin me!
It really do be like that. I’m gonna upvote birb each time he/she gets reposted.
*If you love me let me goooooo...*
"Nah, I'm cool. You give me free food."
Ffs karen im sleeping here
When it landed the second time and snuggled in I involuntarily let out an audible aww.
If you love something, stay.
If it comes back it's yours, if not it was never meant to be
If it comes back, it's yours forever.
Is that one of those birbarangs?
“Dad stop it I’m tired”

Love the way it snuggles in
Throw me again!

...and if it comes back to you, never let it go.
If it comes back, it was meant to be!!
Is that a Boomerang Bird?
I'm so glad this was not one of those 'cat grabs bird and runs away' videos
This bird was probably sold to be set free by a tourist, and it won't be able to fend for itself in the wild.
Continue this thread
Bird: Nah nah. I'm like it here.
Looks like you used CGI to remove the tiny bungee cord.
That’s a fully imprinted baby. It will die in the wild.   You have a new pet.

No fly, only sit.
Looks like birdo here adopted **you**.
If it comes back, it's probably ... broken.
 But I wanna keep the littles ones in the basement 🥺
If it comes back........its probably hungry.
is there a predator nearby or what causes this behavior?

If a random bird likes you, you may need to check with a specialist if you have like superpowers or something
Yo-yos were totally different when I was a kid.
I thought it was a turtle at first
It's flying back because there's a hawk nearby.
Its because you have no mana
If it comes back it’s yours! -Bubz
I love how they kept in character.
Now crush it like all your other dreams

Bye Bye Butterfree... Stop it.. you're crying, I'm not.. sob
I don't see a bird, just a boomerang.
Must be Australian.
If it comes back it's probably broken
Maybe if you stop putting your band back out to it
She doesn’t love u bro
There's most likely a predator near by, the bird thinks it's safer to stay in the dudes hand.
Yeah, but can you do Around The World and Walk The Dog?
Why are ther so much unions around here
O wait...........

So precious❤️
I thought it was a fish at first
Last time this was posted someone mentioned that it probably knew it was pray since something was close and was hungry. Idk tho someone will have to link sources

Say do you know how to train a bird to do this? I have not one but two bird nests along my porch, the birds have let us get closer and closer over the generations but I want to take it a step further. I want to just hold one.
Okay now who is going to tell me that this bird as some terrible brain fungus causing it to do this?

How long are birds life spans though?
If you love someone/something, set them/it free, they'll come back if they love you back:)
Hmm... This seems to be worth more than 2 in a bush.

Human, why? Lemme stey :(
So it’s cute because it seems like the bird likes the person right? But how do we even know that the bird can even conceptualize the person enough to like them, could it be the bird just thinks the hands is a good place to next or to be safe?

Bird: "Don't you fucking try to set me free. I like being here."
"And if it loves you it will come back." That's the second part as I've heard it

If you love something, set it free. If it comes back, you own it. If it doesn't, then you don't own it.
And if it doesn't, you're an asshole.
God, my heart freakin hurts from the cuteness of this.
And if you're hungry then eat it!
Looks like it’s worth two in the bush.
It probably saw those videos where humans set animals free and they immediately get eaten. Probably did the math and figures staying with the human had better odds.
Haha it is probably thinking...Why would I leave someone who gives me free food, water and shelter?
Anyone else expect the bird to just plop on the ground?

Silly bird thinks it's a boomerang.
Guess you’re a Disney princess now.
I had a recused box turtle I had to release once back into a pond and the fucking thing kept swimming back to me.  I was so little and heart broken, even 30 years later I’m still crushed when I picture his tiny face staring back up at me in the water, til he never swam back again.

and that how you get a birb
Reminds me of my last girlfriend.  Ironically, I'm the bird in that situation, not the hand.
If it returns, it's yours. If not, it never was.
That’s love and trust.
i thought it was a little rodent and when you threw it I was like “NOOOOOO”
And if they love you too they'll never stop coming back
If it comes back to you it's yours,  that's how it's known, this was meant to be.

I never knew I needed a birb in my life.
I would put that in breading cook it a 350 degrees and serve it as a chicken to an unsuspecting patron.
If OP is in the US and if that's a house Sparrow, it's completely legal to keep it.
Which Disney princess are you?
And if the something loves you too, it won't let you...
The elusive Yo-yo bird.
Does this test also work for girlfriends?
Hooman: your free, fly into freedom
Le bird:nu
Are you a Disney Princess?
I’d do the same if I received free food, boarding and protection!
Aaaaaaawe
A bird in the palm...  will never leave.
Plot twist: it sees a flying predator and is scared to get away from you
Just like me and my girlfriend.... I'm just waiting for her to return.... Any minute now.... Oh well. :(
Fuck, my heart!
I guess you’re best friends now
This reminds me of my grandpa. 

Once he found a pigeon with a broken wing so he took it in and cared for it until it healed. While recovering my grandpa put the pigeon in the closed chicken cage. After a while the pigeon got better so my grandpa wanted to set it free. He literally couldn't, the pigeon wouldn't leave. This happened again some time later with yet ANOTHER pigeon. Long story short. My grandpa now has a pigeon family in his chicken cage Because the two turned out to be male and female. Very cute!

(For anyone concerned about the living space for the birds. The dimensions L x W x H is 6 x 3 x 3. Plenty of room for a voluntary stay right?)
Tell this to Sony.
You're the mama
Years of Reddit made me expect the bird to flop in the mud like a pebble.
“Welp, I guess I have a bird now...”
Is it too much to ask for that in life? Just once, not even everyday.
"if you love me, let me gooooooooo"
The hand is me. The bird is my feelings for this girl I'm friends with. And I try to let it go but... damn it birb.

Hooman:  Fly Free!!

Bird:  Free food, free lodging, guaranteed safety, and no predators?!! Hell no! I'm not leaving!
An excellent set of yo-yo skills. I’ve seen “walk the dog” but never “toss the bird”.
A monarch butterfly flew into my house yesterday in the morning.  It camped out at the highest point of my living room.  This morning, it was by my desk.  I caught it and released it.  It didn't want to go.

We had a sparrow like this. Found it on the ground on the way to school. On the way home it was still there, so I picked it up and brought it home. We raised it, found out it was a he. When it was time to let him go, he wouldn't go. He kept flying back to us and would then get into his cage. So we ended up keeping him. He loved having singing wars with the Zebra finches.  😊 He was the only bird that we rescued that wouldn't leave us.

Awe that's a beauty ❤
Akuma bracelet.
Edit : A boomerang floof.
Somehow the bird sees a better deal than what your so called freedom in your own environment sold to us.  She is not a zookeeper but yet defied all arguments.  We watch in awe ( aww also ).
Go grandpa GO! Be FREE.
"Becky fucking stop im trying to sleeping!"
Tree Sparrow?

If it's love it's meant to be

Cuddles

I thought they just yeeted a damn fish.
It will come back to you!!
If it’s meant to be it will come back ...  ❤️❤️❤️
That didn't work out too well.
If you live something, set it free. 

If it comes back, it's yours. 

If it doesn't, it never was.
I sometimes want a bird, but I have cats.
New pet dudes

You are a Disney princess now.
U should just eat it
Made me remember Bob Ross' bird
Give it a wee collar
If it comes back it’s yours
Sweet birdie! New housemate?
Well looks like you got yourself a new pet
If this were me, I would already me imagining how I'm going to take this bastard to work, to school, etc. Make it happen lol.
"... If it come back, it is yours"
“No im fine here”
What kind of bird is that?
You forgot the second part, the phrase goes:

"If you love someone, set her free. If she comes back to you, she is yours". Congratulations on your new friend
r/perfectfit
If it comes back, it truly loves you
Obviously it’s not ready to set YOU free.
r/PetTheDamnBird
That's not a bird, that's a boomerang
except not by keeping the hand open. Don’t know it enough to close its landing pad haha
If it comes back it's meant to be
As someone who is scared of birds this is terrifying
Birdberang
Stop cutting onions
boomerang birb
Guess you'll have to keep her. Aw shucks.
"Hey, will you stop throwing me while I try to sit here?"

This brings back childhood memories. I must’ve been 5 or 6, and a little birdie like this one had somehow “invaded” our kitchen. My mom manages to catch him after a lot of fluttering about, and takes him outside. I quickly follow her, hoping to see the little thing fly off into the sunset as she sets him free. Instead, mom crushes his little head against the balcony and throws him away as she dustes off her hands, without skipping a beat, and goes back to cooking dinner. I just stood there for a while, wondering who exactly was this woman I’d been living with... 



... and you must all die. I mean fly. Free. Freeeee.
/r/thisismylifenow
Varius like that dies in Amazon fire.
Tiny birds are soooooooo cute and amazing 😍😍😍
After that video of the dog and the bird on the fence (less aww, more ohh) I kind of was expecting something else. Happy to be pleasantly surprised!
Damn, cool boomerang, bro!
Of all the animals on earth, there's something about birds that makes them particularly beautiful. Especially small birds like this one. They're incredible creatures, plus they get to fly which must be the most amazing thing.
How did you capture it and made it fall in love with you? You're not snow white are you?
"Birb came back! It seems it was worried about you!"
Somethings don't need to be let go like a huge fart in class
What we didn't see was the overhand that came after
Birb
Set it free and crying bro
A bird in a hand is worth two in a bush
Animal saying : "if a human takes care of you, OMG KEEP IT"
And if it comes back it's meant to be
Repost
It's like a yoyo
I guess Reddit has me totally jaded. I completely expected the little birb to drop like a stone. So glad that wasn’t the case.
If you love something set it FREE..... set it FREE. FREE..... Oh fine.
Now you gotta keep it
Are you a Disney Prince🤴/Princess👸 you seem to have a new companion😁
LET IT GOOOOOO!
The manliest of tears were shed... too pure.
Last time this was posted someone said its doing that because it feels in danger and it’s using the palm for protection.
awww windy.
And if it loves you back it will return.
And if it loves you it'll come back.
Snow-white is now a YouTuber?!

*tries with our hamster, she accepts and is promptly eaten by a cat*

Welp. 

(No hammies were harmed in the making of this post)

You want to set it free, But the bird don't want to let go.

So now what?
"If it comes back to you, then it's yours, and if it doesn't, well then you're an asshole" -Bubbles
"Are you my mother?"
"again! again!!"
If it loves you back it will come back to you<3
If you love something, set it on fire.
When I was a kid, I raised a sparrow that fell out of the nest.  My mom said I had to release it when it grew up.  It did the same thing when the time came, so my dad said we needed to rush back into the house. We did and peered through the blinds to see what would happen.  Birdee sat there confused, looking around for a few minutes.  Then another sparrow flew down to her.  They nuzzled each other and then flew off together. This brought back all the feels!
Uhnnnnnnn
The way he rubs his little face into her hand is just precious
Oh ok let me toss my whole entire family out the freaking window
My girlfriend is the bird.
Proper aww!
Love like you're going to let go
Just imagine you lived your whole life in the wild and one day you befriend the apex predator 😄 that not only protects you but feeds you and probably lets you nap in their pocket. This bird has life figured out.
İf you love it set it free, 
if it returns you it is yours, 
if it doesn't return it haven't been yours at all.
U r my one tree

I want to see, the world from

Ur hand. And poop too
The feels, my heart.
Well, now u have a pet bird
Let birdie SOAR!!! That type of birdie, would rather have been ate by the ,🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜🐜
Ok. I was expecting cat in this gif
Ok, this is **THE** cutest thing I have seen on this sub. Nothing previous compares and I doubt anything will.
This sounds horrible and I feel even worse after reading Schnoodle's poem, but my first thought at the end was that she was going to close her hand and squish the bird--was actually surprised for a second she didn't.  My brain sometimes....
If it comes back,it loves you too
Micro Beaky Buzzard !

AWWWWW he loves you too 😭😭😭
If it loves you too, it will come back.
When you're trying to get your kids to move out.
I better open up my basement in that case.
I hope you kept the precious lil bb!
Oh.., the classic bird meets yoyo...im sure there has to be a thin string somewhere. No bird is THIS nice
If they return, don’t fuck up.
Ahhh naahh, you can't fool us, it's every time a different bird...
The bird version of "5 more minutes" of early morning.
This is adorable and gave me all the feels
I like you.  I’m going to stay.  

-bird probably
Keep it.
Try a bigger backswing maybe. And over a cliff. Maybe
Why can't I up this more than once?! 😍
I hear that's worth at least two more birds in the bush...
IF YOU LOVE ME LET ME GOOOOO
New age yo-yo
Thought it was going to be that video where the bird is set free... and the cat jumps it :D
Plot twist: OP is a Disney Princess. That's not the same birb.
Ok dude you gotta keep this thing it loves you! Like seriously what the heck? XD I wish animals loves me that much
