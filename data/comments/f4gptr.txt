Aww, his harness doesn’t quite fit yet
Are you sure that isn't an otter?
Everyone knows it’s Butters!
“Hey, Government. It’s Me, Butters.”
Oh my...on my way to steal Butters. Pack his bag for me. 🐕❤
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day. HI, BUTTERS!
Please tell me the breed of this pupper.
That is the face of a true, faithful friend. I wish you great adventures together!
I named my pug butters. After the South Park character right?
South Park or Dresden Files?
That dog is all neck
What kinda place does this landlord of yours own?
Everyone knows it's butter's, eh that's me
It's almost as hairy as you!
Why do you have a landlord if you live on a couch floating in a lake?
I’ve never been the 1,000th upvote before but it feels good :)
Is it because he looks very polite?
Mantequilla!
Does he play Hello Kitty Island Adventure?
Mantequilla!!!
He’s awesome!
Adorable! Congrats.
Those ears!
Hi butter your so cute
Boop
Professor Chaos
Please put in the proper amount of training time to ensure it doesn't bark 24/7 or whenever you are not home and it is alone. Your landlord will regret his/her decision and it will hurt the chances of future tenants to have pets if you don't do this right and the neighborhood complains about all the barking. 

This might seem like a no-brainier to a lot of you. Sadly it seems it is not obvious to most people.
You’re grounded mister
Wish my landlord would do the same 😭
Take pictures of all rooms before dog moves in. Landlords and dogs normally don’t go together. Start saving now for the bill your landlord will give you. Expect $2000 to $5000. Depending on where you live.
Awwww butters hes tiny.... his harness it like a nose band I use for one of mine, its huge ..aww
You cant fool me. I know what otters look like
BUTTERS! Are you having liposuction surgery? Tell me the truth.
r/ntbdbiwdfta
Butters looks like he was worth the wait <3
He's on a beach therefore he is *exotic Butters*
r/illegallysmoldogs
Everyone knows it’s Butters!

THATS ME
Butters! Stop barking, you're an incel!
Smol dog, big heart.
Please tell me your last name is Stotch. Or your name is Leopold or Leo or that’s your middle name.
\*VERY\* cute!
That doggie is definitely a Butters.
Damn, bro, butters is such a good name... he looks like a lil’ butterscotch
Hi butters. The internet loves you.
Ferret? Or pupperino? Aww
What kind of carpeted boat do you live on?
Butters looks very handsome and adorable!
Is he part giraffe?
My heart just filled with happiness for you and it's leaking out my eyes a bit. I think I, too, may have to endure the wait a while longer to meet my furryfuzyfourlegged soulmate again! In the meantime, please feel free to fill my feed with pics of Butters
Polka will NEVER die!!!
Polka will never die!!
Dude is all neck lol
CUTE
His eyes like 2 black holes
Are you a South park fan?
\*dog pees in house\*

DAMMIT BUTTERS!
Why is there a harness on your ferret?
Exotic
Lululu I got some apples....lululu you got some too
Why that dog's neck so long?
The neck to body ratio is enormous
Don't look now, but you may have adopted a ferret.
Homie, that’s a stoat
I think Butters is the cutest puppy I've ever seen
I want to hug this dog.
“Shutup Butters, you’re an incel !”
What the hell did you do to butters 1 and 2?
First name Waldo
Like... Waldo Butters?
That is one of the most adorable pups I’ve ever seen.  I would grab him up if I could.   He’s all I saw when I saw his picture.   Why do so many people make major issues about other things in the picture that are insignificant?   I had to wade through hundreds of comments just to say I thought this dog is major adorable.  And that’s it.
I love you butters
Butters! You're grounded!
Everyone knows, it’s butters!
You should call him Professor Chaos
Cute dog but what in the hell are you sitting on? I am so confused. It looks hairy/fuzzy, but it's outside near water. Is it furniture of some kind? A weird cushion on a boat? I DONT UNDERSTAND IT PLEASE HELP.
Narrarator: "only one thing can save the world. Part otter. Part dog. Its butter!"
Beautiful fellow
Let me get this straight u guys live on a beach?
💚my family dog is named butterscotch aka butters aka b-dog 
Love it I’m sure this pup will bring you so much joy
The close perspective makes it look like half dog half mongoose 🤣
get a black one too and call him token
everyone knows its butters!
This post has 102k upvotes, but OP only has 8,000 karma. Can anyone explain why this is?
Idk, he looking kinda slutty with his collar hanging low.
Is your landlord Posiden?
Umm pretty sure that's an otter, not a dog
Landlords leech off of society.
That there is a nice pupper
Landlord gives eviction notice. Now can't find a place that allows dogs.
Make sure he has a dog sitter when you're not around. Puppies can tend to howl when they're separated and you don't want you neighbors to resent you and your landlord to regret their gracious decision. That said, that's a seriously cute dog and I want to give him pets. 10/10 would let lick my face (but not the mouth, never the mouth)
Beautiful pupper.. Looks like my Valentino when he was little
butters is very exotic and I would die for him
I fucking hate landlords but I love butters.
HIS NAME IS BUTTERS awwwwwwwwww
What you have got there is some sort of adorable ferret.
good boi butters!
Awwww! So heccin cute
Is this a little jack?
Freaking adorable...
Did he come pre-grounded?
Sweet
So handsome 😀
Awwwww how perfect.
I know imma sound dramatic, but I would die for butters
He's so cute. My heart just melt
Am I the only one that initially read the headline to mean that landlord is allowed the dog, and not the tenet?
That face! That name! OMG I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU! Congratulations!
He looks very polite
Exotic butters, perhaps?
I would die for Butters
Is he called Butters because he makes you melt?
Butters is like 33% neck. Adorable
He is precious, I want to give him a big hug around that long, elegant neck.
What kind of dog? :)
Is this dog part weasel?
He’s so cute I want to rip my arms off and smack myself over the head with them repeatedly
How did he get his name?
He’s so smol!
Hi butters!
I LOVE BUTTERS 😍😍😍😍
Nobody asking where this gentleman lives?? Down at da beach??
Poetry... they should have sent a... /r/Poem_for_your_sprog

Good for you!
He’s adorable I’ve been wanting a dog for a while 😭
Thanks, I love him
I’ve never seen a prettier internet pup.
I love the name. I have a retriever/chow mix and named him Butters.
He’s gonna piss on the carpet.
He looks like a Martin or something like that lol so cute!
Are you on a couch on the beach? Lol
r/rarepuppers
I like it
"Butters enjoy life with hooman. Even if my harness no fit."
I thought he was the third Butters lol
He looks very polite.
He looks like a lil weasel
So cute. He looks a lil like otter almost
Bitch don't you want to make some real fucking money
I'd like to meet him. Adorable pupper!!
Butters is my favorite South Park character. Go Butters!!
Long neck mgee
where are you because i want him so badly or to pet him.
OMG. This is the most adorable puppet I’ve ever seen. I am so jealous of you.
Oh my God his legs are so short in proportion to is body it is the cutest thing
What happened to the first two Butters. :
Carpet......meet piss

Deposit.....meet gone
His ears look so soft!!
Such a cutie
Bdsm dog
That's a stoat.
Has landlord met him yet?
But where's General Disarray??
My brain is having so much trouble with this pic: the hairy leg that seemed like part of the natural background, then realizing that it seems like you’re on a couch...by the ocean? And then finally the adorable dog that makes me forget for a sec the other issues.
So handsome
Where’s his bottom bitch?
I had a rental for a while and I always allowed dogs and kitty’s too.
I have a pup named Butter, too! Shes a corgi

😍😍😍!!!! Hi butters
He looks like hybrid of a deal and a dog haha
This is the cutest dog I've ever seen.
I’m not paying attention to anything like the description of this picture or anything like that except how cute this puppy is
Hi Butters.
Nah pretty sure that's a ferret
I hope he gets his very own episode!
Don't sell him to Paris Hilton.
Hi Butters 🥺
Part dog, part otter, part meerkat.
So cute!! I call my son butters 🤣 we use she's butter as a moisturizer and when he wants some he just says "butters butters" lol
I would die for Butters
AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Lmao OP isn't from London
Beautiful!
/r/redditisfacebooknow
He’s so cute!!!
Does he tap dance?
Butters is far too cute to be real. Congrats :3
Professor Chaos is soon to come
My landlord has finally allowed dogs too but only if we get pet insurance as well which we can’t do right now. Butters is so flipping cute
In a good way, this dog looks like it has a weasel way back in the family tree.
Butters, you're grounded
Butters is a sweety. I love him.
I just saw a post about a cat named butters
Your landlord was ready to replace the baseboards anyway. Lol. Cute little bastard though.
He looks so cute I wanna spread him on my toast :)
I love that name, my dogs name is Seamus (Shay-mus) but I've called him Butters as a term of endearment for years now so he knows.
Butters is rather dignified.  I'm sure Butters laid out the terms of rent and schmackos in the most diplomatic way.
Everyone knows, it's butters!
Where them rocks n water your standing by, and do you fish there. I am the king of non sequiturs and preoccupied as well as obsessed w fishing. Dog looks cool
what's your strategy if the landlord changes their mind?
Otter pup
What a good lad
r/ntbdbiwdfta
LOVE!!!!!
I swear this dog is part weasel
The dog is grrouunded
Man I used to have a golden lab called Butters. Killed too young by a snake bite :(
Another vicious attack dog
More like buttercup!!!
What kind of dog is that?! It’s gorgeous! I need one lol
He's a bad bad bear!
Big head mode *activated*
r/ntbdbiwdfta
I think that's a weasel
He looks like a Butters.  😀😀😀
He’s so cute!!
Awwww.   Be still my heart!!  Soooooo cute!!
Is Butters part giraffe? That's a long neck
Butters can move in with me in case your landlord changes their mind.
To freaking cute.
Aaawww, and Butters is such a cute name tooo
Oh my god he’s absolute perfection and deserves all the treats in the world 😍😍😍
My cat is named Butters! 

Best pet name ever
What are you sitting on? Spongebob's hand me down couch?
His cuteness melts my heart
Butters is a angel. I’ll fight anyone that says different!
Hilarious, I love Butters
What a cutie 🐾🐾
Cute dog. Part giraffe?
He looks like a lochness monster puppy
What an amazing name
Polka will never die!
Trying to figure out what the hell you're sitting on. Is that a carpeted beach?
The same thing happened to our dog but inside a Dormitory!
Look at this handsome devil!
World-class ear flop
He's a gud boi
Cute!!!
I think you got a giraffe there.
Name op
You stole my dogs name
Looks like a great place to live!
Cute 
But i am worried tht soon you guys will shorten his name and start calling him “Butt”
I love you butters☺️☺️🥰
Awesome name
Lol cutie
SO adorable! Please be sure to housetrain him VERY well as landlords won't let others have dogs in the future if you take advantage of it and trash the carpet with piss stains/poop etc.
Excellent name choice!
So cute!
Oh I LOVE him! And I might love his name even more!
BUTTERS YOURE AN INCEL
That's one of the cutest jack russel puppy I have ever seen!
Awwww oh my gosh
OH MY GOD HIS HARNESS MAKES HIM LOOK LIKE HE HAS A GIRAFFE NECK
Obviously your landlord was unable to resist that face!
he looks just like my dog omg
Necc
Oh, hi Milo!
I would die for Butters
*Awwwwwwww!!!!*

Love the name ;3

I have a golden retriever and one cat. I used to have two, but the male one, Orion, passed away on January 25 2020. He and the female, Gemini, are brother and sister.
What a long-neck
Awwwww, hiya Butters❣ Oh my, what a cutie patootie ... CONGRATULATIONS❣🐶
I would have allowed a dog from day 1, especially one as cute as Butters.
I have a dog named Butters, to go with her sister; Peanut.
What breed is that?
Too cute 😍💕💕
Absolutely adorable!!!  
He wears that harness très chic!
This looks like it will also be the last dog landlord allows.
Hi Butters!
He is precious ❤️ What a good Boye!
Waiting for the 'landlord with the dog he didn't want' pics
Landlord is a good dog name.
Awww

Who's the rascal with the tweezers in his pocket?
Love butters!  Has a parakeet name butters- great south park choice my friend! 💗🐶
POLKA WILL NEVER DIE!!!
Is his real name Leopold?
It is wonderful  
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
What a handsome and dignified young gentleman!
You live at the beach and you still have a landlord?
He's so serious, I wonder what he is looking at?
Oh my lord he is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
A cute name for a cute pup!
Landlord allowed a dog, but you got a ferret instead.  :)
Well henlo little one
 Butters is a keeper!
that is like the cutest dog i’ve ever seen
I dibble tapped trying to like and I zoomed right into the dogs eyes 🙂
he’s so cute! Also, pets with food names are the best
Sorry to tell you, that's a marten, not a dog.
He’s such a cutie! I think it’s unfair that landlords are allowed to forbid animals. I mean you pay money to live there and if a pet is a part of your life they should allow it.. well it’s the same here in Germany, a lot of landlord generally rule out all pets and it’s so hard to find a rented apartment if you have pets
I ready love him!
We'll Meet Again is a pretty accurate description.
He's all neck! Love it!
s m o l
lil jack!  OMG so cute.
So cute ❤️😆
Cutie!
'Alriight Butters listen up buddy. I'ma need your part of the rent by the last week of the month can't be late...'

Butters: **licks mah face**
Definitely kidnapping this guy. Holy crap what a perfect looking dog
Omg I’m in love! 😍😍🙂
Otter vibes.
Why can landlords forbid pets and "senior communities" (ages *n* and up) are permitted but it is not allowed to have an apartment complex that forbids parents / wards with children?

Children can be even more of an annoyance to neighbors / cause more damage to an apartment than a pet.
So cute!
What breed is this cute puppy?
Approve
I love your pet seal
Landlords eh, scum of the earth. Eat the Rich!  


Also, Butters looks like one hell of a pupper!
I've got something in my front pocket for you
Why don't you reach on in my pocket and see what it is?
There, grab onto it, it's just for you
Give it a little squeeze and say: "How do you do?"

I would take a bullet for butters

Congratulations - this is the cutest dog in existence and you’re lucky to have such a wonderful friend in your life!

Year 1 can we have a dog?, No. 

Year 2 can we have a dog, uh, no

Year 3 can we have a dog, sigh, sure. Yes. 

**Bay Area version**

Year 3 can we have a dog, wait you still can afford to live here? raise the rent, and NO on the dog. snicker, snicker, snicker.
Oh, Butters, you've melted my heart
fuck land lords
Fuck landlords
very nice and good company
This is your landlord saying they trust you, and plz don't move out.
God damn it butters.
What breed is it? If anyone knows, pls tell.
I had a Boston terrier named butters. He ran away almost 2 years ago. 💔
Yo wtf is that landscape surface? As a CE I’m fucking perplexed. Looks like slope stabilization gone wrong. Please provide info for me intellectual improvement
Landlords can't stop you from obtaining a pet.
Awwwww you Sonovabitch...  <3 <3 <3






Edited: to add hearts s.o.b.
Holy hell, that's adorable
I came here for the adorable doggo,  but I have stayed for how strange this photo is. The longer I look, the weirder it gets! I just thought this was a dog sitting on rocks at the beach, but then.... those rocks aren't rocks at all! Human body parts, a weird.... couch? WHAT IS HAPPENING?!
Do you live on a dirty couch at the beach?
Butters' neck looks so long because of that loose harness! I'll be honest, it made me stare for a second before I realized
Before really paying attention to the photo the title lead me to believe you'd had the dog for 3 years already.
My parents have a new dog they named Butters.  I'll see if I can get some pictures up soon.
Precious!!! 🐈
You are my forever human. - Dog
Bu-bu-but-butah-bbb-butters!
Never have I yelled out loud "AWWW IT'S BEAUTIFUL" to a dog pic before until now
BUTTERS, YOU'RE AN INCEL!
I do in fact love Butters.
He is good man. Landlord is too
Want.
My name is Butters and I'm a doggo. Nice to meet you
What breed of dog is this little guy?

Man we’ve been here 5 years and he won’t budge.

Can’t even have fish.

Glad you got Butters! He’s cute. ❤️
So worth the wait! :)
Yay butters is so cute

Hi Butters.

More like Butterscotch, because he looks pretty darn sweet
Aw wow, neato!
This dog somehow looks like a cross species hybrid.
Not to be dramatic but I would die for Butters. I love Butters. ❤️
Just...AWWWWWW
Upvote cause I used to have a dog named butters :(
Hey Butters :3
Butters?! Did you tear up Dad's shoes? You're GROUNDED mister!
In UK slang Butters means ugly :p

Keep him safe from Paris Hilton.

The name butters makes this post so much cuter

Good gravy is that a dog-ostrich-giraffe mix? It's neck looks longer than it's body 😂👍
The harness not fitting yet puts this over the top for me.
Looks a lot better since he got that ninja star out of his eye!

Hello Butters!
Is this Jervis Bay?
Awwwwwww 😍😍😍😍
As a renter who really, really wants to adopt a pup but have a “no pets” clause in the lease, I’m wondering if you have advice for bringing the topic up with a landlord. Did you straight up ask? Did you propose an additional deposit, monthly pet fee, etc.?
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for Butters!
Paw-to-nose height is v low. He/She is a keeper.
Butters is a good doggo 😍
I was looking for something to spread on my toast!

Anyway great for you congrats on your four legged buddy!

It's cuteness cuts my heart like a hot knife through margarine.
He’s a cutie!!!
You are in grounded, mister!
In the words of A Tribe Called Quest... “not no parkay, not no margarine, simply butter(s)”

Congrats. Enjoy the ride. I have a 4-legged flatulent clown (English Bulldog).

You live on the beach?! Dope. Your landlord owns the beach?! Respect.

He is a lil pat of butter, super cute.
Aw, Jack Russells are the best. Enjoy him!

I created an instagram for my baby Butters. No pics on it at the moment, but feel free to give it a follow for upcoming Butters content. ☺❤

I love Butter's. He has a real intense look in his eye. Like he just killed a bitch and needs to decide how to get rid of the body.

Why does a landlord get to dictate whether you can keep a pet with you or not?
Wow. I've seen that dog before but he was a criminal mastermind named Professor Chaos. Glad to see someone finally grounded him.
My ferrets name is Butters!!
Atleast it’s not a pitbull
You rent a section of waterfront and live there?
Had Butters been around three years ago I’m sure that landlord would have changed his mind earlier 🖤🖤🖤
i need a dog. but i am alergic. 

send help.
fuck landlords
How could anyone say 'no' to such cuteness!
PSA: in many cities you can get your dog written off as an "emotional support" animal and even get the pet rent waived and circumvent no pet rules.
Hurray for those landlords! 🙌🙌🙌

Is Bruce your landlord? Your dog looks very polite.
I lived at my old house for 8 years and they never allowed pets. For multiple reasons they there asshats, but now we live in a place that does allow pets. We're hoping to get a dog in the summer! And your butters is adorable.
aww :3
Nice marmot.
What is he sitting on? And why is nobody asking this!?
Bruh if I'm ever some landlord I'll make it a requirement for any tenants to have dogs.
Very happy for you but you could have gone online and paid like $75 for an Emotional Support Animal letter. It's a lot cheaper than service animal training but is almost as good for letting you get what you want
You say 'finally' like it's your God given right to be allowed to bring a dog into someone else's home
Thanks for showing me the Landlords perspective ...I always thought bad people made more/costly damage than a pet could. (Taking appliances etc) Nieve I guess.
Heckin doin my heart a melt.
Just get the damn dog no landlord is gonna evict a good tenant over a tiny pup
People still suck
