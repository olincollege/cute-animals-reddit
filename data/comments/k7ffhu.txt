I like how one duck took charge. 

"GUYS THIS IS BULLSHIT WE'RE GOING BACK RIGHT THE FUCK NOW"
I like how it looks like they had a mini debate about staying out before going back in.
This is my cat during winter.

‚ÄúLet me out! Let me out! Let me out! ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ Let me in! Let me in! Let me in!‚Äù
"Retreat lads, retreeaat!!"
"Yeeeaaay...yeah...no"
My dogs when it‚Äôs raining...
The last two: ‚ÄúYou guuuuuys, c‚Äômoooon, its not even that cold!! )= what the duck‚Äú
This will be me when COVID is over
The story so far:
In the beginning the Winter was created.
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.
NOPE. nopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenopenope
On second thought, let's hibernate.
Some of them ran out...and flew back in.
[Reminds me of this classic.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-HDJJNbBXI)
Hey I know these ducks! They live on a sanctuary at [SHO Farm in Vermont](https://www.sanctuaryatsho.org/sho-farm)!
Guess you could say they got cold feet
[deleted]
Who in the duck let's that many ducking ducks stay inside their ducking house?
*Ok, that's enough of that now.*
Ducks have feelings too.
This is how I feel in the winter.
That's awesome.  My cat does the same thing, except she argues with herself,  and then I'm the bad guy for even suggesting she go outside.
u/savevideo
Their duck house looks pretty nice.
That, is a lot of ducks
my old dog began doing this at nights where i live so i bought him a sweater. He doesnt really like it but understands its the only way he can go outside without freezing his ass off so he makes me take it off afterwards
Every Introvert ever
Aussieman voice intensifies...
"This Sheila says 'Na, fuck na, my flippers are freeeezing!'
‚ÄúYes but actually no.‚Äù
[Reminds me of the horses being let out in the snow.](https://i.imgur.com/a3NVq4l.mp4)
There like wait. . . . . Nah let's go. Lol
Have had this moment at the beginning of every winter
Hahahahahahah! Very smart ducks.
[reminds me of this simpsons clip lol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9z0jCxfK2M#t=1m5s)
RETREAT!!!!
I definitely enjoyed these ducks changing their mind. Mood AF.
GO THAT WAY

wait no :(


GO THIS WAY
These ducks perfectly represent me during winter.
RELEASE THE QUACKEN - you know what, never mind.
Yeeeeah... Duck that.
Who let the ducks out?
If you listen closely, you can actually hear that one duck saying ‚Äúwell look AT THIS. GOD. DAMN. BULL. SHIT... Christ.‚Äù
‚ÄúYep yep yep yep yeyeyep yep yep yep yep yep yeee.... *stops* no. No no no no no no no no‚Äù
just kidding...
Enjoy indeed

Aight, I'ma head ... (Sees the outside) ... in.
The king duck: retreat!
[deleted]
WHat savage has 30 ducks living in their house?
STAAAAWP
hey does anyone have a link or source to this video
Hey look, it‚Äôs the US Congress.
Guess they got cold feet
the last two ducks: 
‚Äúcmon fred we have to stick together‚Äù 
‚Äúffs, it‚Äôs just snow‚Äù
You see guys, this is why we're supposed to fly south for the winter!
So is there like an ‚ÄúAlpha Duck‚Äù in these groups or something? They all turn around right after one of the ducks quacks very loudly. Almost seems like they were listening to a command but I‚Äôm not a duckologist so what do I know.
Geese aren‚Äôt ducks
Ducks fucking are awesome
FREEDOM!!

Abort

Abort

Abort the mission and run back
all i heard was "fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck..."
Adorable little fuckers
I love how they‚Äôre jumping to keep their lil feet‚Äôs from getting too cold
Their feet must have gotten cold, they started flying a bit
Duck #24: "Maybe next year we should try that *mai-gray-shun* thing our cousins do?"
"Quack! Quack! Qua... BACK!!! BACK!!! BACK!!!"
u/Mistborn_Archer
RELEASE THE QUACKENS
Look at all those chickens!
Ok I love how many of the ducks were like, nope my feet are cold FLY BACK TO THE DOOR!
Get all your ducks in a snow
LOL....I don't blame em! Just a quick look-around is enough to see the  cold fluffy stuff....then back to the warm.
Perfect summary of all of us species who don't have the sense to hibernate.  
And he look in my dog's pleading eyes when she wats to go out until I open the door to the freezing tundra.
Since OP said ¬´¬†Please¬†¬ª i did enjoy these ducks.
Duck, it's cold out here!
Me running into 2020 like...
OutsiDE MY BROTHERS!!.... what the heeeelllNOOOO
If you listen carefully you can hear Davey Duck shoutquacking from inside letting them all know he's got the Playstation working again.
Ducks- Nah this ain't happening.. The party's inside
I did enjoy that. Thanks
This looks like what my dog does; Charges outside, and immediately regrets her decision to have gone outside.
Thanks i did enjoy
It‚Äôs like the duck version of the polar plunge lol
Lol this is the cutest thing.  Thank you for sharing
Fuck fuck fuck FUUUUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
I'm imagining all the shit in the house
It was too ducking cold
There's so many gifs like these, can we have a dedicated /r/animalsVsnow or something yet
I was close to killing myself and I seen this

Thank you
Nope, Nope, nope
Too funny. Not stupid
I apparently love when ducks change their minds!
FREEDOM!

******pauses********

OK, IMPRISONMENT ISN'T THAT BAD.
This demonstrates precisely how i went from being an in my prime athlete loving every motherfuckin' minute of it ass kicking football, (soccer) tennis and boxing to now just sitting around doing sweet fuck all.
at the 8 second mark: "oh FUCK FUCK FUCK THIS SHIT"
Why does this remind me of the nematodes?! *Meep meep too cold, too cold*.
‚ÄúWho had this idea?!‚Äù
FREEDO- wait! It‚Äôs cold! Too cold! Back inside!!
I could just hear over a dozen ‚ÄúNope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.‚Äù
They were like ‚Äúnope.‚Äù Lol
That was a whole lot of nope lol
"Yay! Yay! Ya....oh, oh...NOPE! NOPE! NOPE!"
They were like *nah bro it‚Äôs too cold out here let‚Äôs go back*
nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
I love this. I never knew that a duck was my spirit animal until today
My dog does this
The real loud bangs in about 10 seconds I liked how it looks like there was a small argument about staying outside before they went back inside
Same, ducks. Same.
Thanks for sharing that üòä
can just hear Ozzyman's voice going " yeah nah F that"
First day of snow, second day of snow.
If you've ever heard an Aussie say "yeah, nah", this is exactly what it means.
Quack, quack, quack.... Nope! Quack, quack, quack
Quack this dude .... eh yeah quack your asses back in y‚Äôall
Retreat! Retreat!
I‚Äôve always said the beautiful thing about being human is being able to change you mind... but maybe that‚Äôs just all of life?
"Fuck go back"
Reminds me. Guys we can head back to office to work again. Charge.

Till the cold of reality hits home (weather, traffic, the co-worker that all avoids)

Head back Home, work from home.
Yep... opened my chickens' door this afternoon and they just... did.. not go out. Oh hell no, we don't like snow.
I wish one duck stayed outside like a Lone Ranger
I have ducks too and they‚Äôre the most comical set of animals I‚Äôve ever had.
They‚Äôre clearly honking ‚Äúnope nope nope‚Äù
If ‚Äúhell naw‚Äù was a duck....
Haha that‚Äôs fantastic!
Out out out 
...
Cold cold cold
In in in
"OUTOUTOUTOUT... OUT..... out.. out... In?..... IN IN IN IN IN IN"
Cold duck! I ain‚Äôt had cold duck since the last time I hit the numbers.
Would you say they got... cold feet?
Wait,is this snow?? ITS SNOW!! DUCK THIS!! Its Quacking freezing!! Everybody back inside!
‚ÄúOh wait. This sucks‚Äù
The one duck who stayed out there is like that one kid who wears shorts in the winter
TIL ducks can make faster decisions than my friends deciding on pizza toppings.
I enjoyed this very much 10/10 thank you
Robert:Hey bois lets hang out outside
Everyone: Hell ya
*goes outside
Everyone:Fuck you Robert
Video illustration next to definition of "noped right out of there."
‚ÄúNo‚Äù
‚ÄúThe fuck is this shit‚Äù
'Let's not go to the pond.  T'is a silly place."
‚ÄúOn second thought, let‚Äôs not go to Camelot...‚ÄôTis a silly place‚Äù
Aren't they supposed to fly south during the winter?
Release the quaken.
Omfg this is the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all month besides my kitty cats! Totally just saved this.
Outside. Outside. Outside. Outside.

My cat does this every morning now. I usually let her out into the sideyard to sniff around while I make her breakfast. These days she mostly gives the air about 6 sniffs, wiggles her whole body, and turns right around. It's cute
The real question is why you have so many ducks in your house.
[Actually, fuck this](https://youtu.be/lHH3s5u_2bc?t=9)
https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/k7fbml/ducks_vs_snow/

This person posted this same thing 5 minutes before you.
"My webs aren't chilling like I need them to be chilling. Let's duck back in."
Duck this shit, I‚Äôm out!
Maybe later
Yup that‚Äôs enough exercise for me back in fellas.
u/savevideo
That is too funny!
There was an attempt to go out
Lol all I can imagine there quacks translated to ‚Äú nope nope nope nope nope‚Äù.
"nope, not today."
Everybody's thoughts about going into the mall for sales but then seeing the whole building being almost full
I thought I was watching a red dead gif
The cutest
Noped the duck out of there real quick!
No, is cold
Was waiting for the last one to close the door
They nope-ed the heck out of there
Not today sir, not today.
Close captioning.

Yay, yay, awesome, cool!
Oh shit it's cold!
So cold!
Run back in!!
Fly in!
What? We can fly?
Fly, fly you fools!
Go, go now!
"oh this is cool! yep. hmm. damn its cold. Im going back"
Looks like ducks aren't really all terrain chickens!
Thats pretty much how I feel stepping outside when the weather is sub zero....ü•∂
‚Äúthis ain‚Äôt it‚Äù
I'm freezing my fricken flippers off!
"Yup yup ^yup yup...... nope nope ^nope nope."
Big ol flock of nope.
Well, one good thing came from this. We finally know the duck to english translation for the word, 'nope'.
Me when it‚Äôs cold out
I wonder what happen that they changed their minds  to go back in?
Look at who ya came to see...

We tha ducks
"What is this white stuff on the ground?!? I'm freaking out!!"

"RUN AWAY!!!"
Me thinking "oh it's not that cold, let's sit on the front porch", then my housemate and I sit there for 2 minutes shivering and go "are you cold? I'm cold. Let's go inside."
This reminds me of my cat, who is always first to go outside and disappear for hours during the summer but then when winter hits, he just goes for a second to pee and you can find him next to the door 5 minutes later.
Lmaoooo so cute
Back to the pile!
"Out out out out out out."

"Cold cold cold cold cold."
Nope!!!
That's hilarious.
I like how they are all like ‚ÄúCHAAAAAAARGE‚Äù and then just change to ‚ÄúEh maybe tomorrow‚Äù
Is that a huge Oreo cookie?
This reminds me of that video with the two horses who play chicken and see who is the first to run back inside
When danger reared it‚Äôs ugly head they quickly turned their tail an fled...
FUCK THIS SHIT I'M OUT!
They really said damn it's cold out here
NOPE
TIL that ducks are smart.
"SNO--h hell no."
Haha you can hear that one duck go ‚Äúretreat! Retreat!!  We‚Äôve made a mistake‚Äù
The last few are the Bear Grylls of ducks.
CHAAAAAARG- wait no it‚Äôs cold go back
QUACK!!!
 We leave now...We go now
Rapey ducks saying **NO** thats a first.
Love
They don't like fowl weather
Even ducks are more united than humans
They all head back to the quackery.
It's the tail wiggling I love
"Everybody Charge!......Wait, no... Everybody Flee!"
It seemed like the firsts ones out and last ones back in were saying ‚ÄúGuys! It‚Äôs not that bad! Come back out!‚Äù
"oh duck that"
I *do* enjoy this!
*but guys its not that bad* - the first one out.

Ets go inside.
This is what my 2020 needed. Thank you for sharing lol!
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.......................Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope!
Relatable and adorable
*Chanting* "Too cold...TOO COLD"
Meanwhile on the local river I can see one duck sitting in the water while another duck stands on the ice next to it chatting, apparently
I enjoyed that a great deal. Thank you.
Dont blame them. Lol. I feel like doing that every time it snows.
Wack wack wack, wack wack wack
Forgot their masks
I‚Äôm out of this mess!
There are so many videos of ducks changing there minds, and I love them!
Screw you quackers, home. (invision this as Cartman for full effect)
Snowpe!

Duck soup.
FREEEEEDOM

Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen that was hilarious.

 Sometimes I feel like doing the same.

 Just going "Yup, that's enough outside."
Who's idea was this, anyway?!

They're poor lil feetsies
Looks like my dang kids when I tell them to play outside during the winter.
Cat wants out in winter, open patio door, steps 2 paws outside, changes mind, goes and eats food.

They were all ‚Äúnope!!‚Äù
So this house just has like 50 ducks in it for half the year?
As an immigrant from India I can totally relate. We were fed lies by Bollywood about how glamorous and fun snow was ...till I encountered my first snow fall driving through Oklahoma one evening which turned into a blizzard in a couple of hours and our car slid off into a ditch and I spent an hour in a cop's car till the towtruck arrived. Never again. Houston is as north as I will ever agree to live in!

Those ducks are my spirit animal. That perfectly summarizes outdoors/the general public in the year of our dead lord that has forsaken us 2020.
I like how the last five or so are like, "well, this party sucks now"
You can hear the moment they all start screaming, "BACK, BACK, BACK!" right at 0:09
sweeeeeeettt
"FREEDOM!!!
...actually we can stay for a bit more"
That one hen quacking loud was like "Aw, hell naw!" üòÇüëç
My ducks hate snow lol
I could hear the conversation. 
‚ÄúHey guys it snowed‚Äù
‚ÄúHeck yeah, lets go play‚Äù
‚Äú Damn its alittle chilly out here‚Äù
‚ÄúYep, im cold. Im going back inside. This sucks.‚Äù
Dangerous out of bed!! Quack!!
Yesterday I saw ducks smashing through the top layer of ice. to keep on swimming. These ducks are pampered.
Leader made decision we follow... wait no
Nope nope noope nope nope

Nope.
They were like, "Can we go outside? Can we go outside? Can we go outside? Can we go outside?"

Five seconds later, "It's too cold! I'm going in!"

These duckos said "nah, let's go back into the hot tub jacuzzi"

It's weird,  mine love the snow and the bitter cold.  I live in Central Minnesota and it gets well below 0¬∞f. I normally have to herd them into their coop when it's -20 or so...
I also quack when i go outside

I like how ducks have a ‚Äúdash‚Äù button.
I think they wanted to go into the snow. Just not for very long.
"Swim day is canceled!"
Ate those khaki camels???
Absolutely not!
Keep your eye on the first duck that comes out! Lol Streches their neck like where‚Äôs everyone going?!

I remember this GIF from April
Is there any sub for videos like these? Because I've seen several of these videos of animals going out into very cold weather and immediately regretting it (cats, dogs, horses, ducks, etc.) and it's always funny.
It's beautiful

Duck see, duck do.
Be waking up every day
&#x200B;

Reminds me of my chickens. They say chickens can't fly, but mine would stand at the door of the chicken coop, contemplating the overall whiteness of the fresh fallen snow. Maybe tip a toe into the snow on the ramp. Finally, they'd gather up some courage, crouch down a little, and spring off into the air, flapping their wings for all it's worth to reach the lower branches of the distant trees.
Didn't realize there was sound at first. Made it SO much better with sound, and I already thought it was great without sound.
soldier fall back fall back
The new squidward chair meme
The last 6 in the door will have formed their own tribe by now, frolicking happily in the snow. They didnt want to go back, they were commanded to.
This is so great
Smart ducks!
I don't understand why birds flap their wings to fly 2 feet. It's probably much easier and efficient just to walk those 2 feet. But ***noooooo***. They feel the need to flaunt their evolutionary advantage.
Look at those chickens!
They just decided to duck out
RETREATTTT!!!!
How do we @ tony baker

## DUCKS CAN CLOSE ONE EYE AND PUT HALF THEIR BRAIN TO SLEEP.
That loud call is a "come back" call duck hunters use when the birds get to far away from the blind.
Aw duck no!
Its like you finally get outside for recess after waiting on that one kid to shut his pie hole...and as soon as you get out there the bell rings to come back in.

We had our first snow of the winter a few days ago. My new chickens that were hatched this spring/summer didn‚Äôt want to touch it. The old birds were just like ‚Äúwell this shit is back‚Äù and went about their business.
At 9 seconds you hear one yelling "Fall back! Fall back!"
Enjoyed
I feel the same way in the winter
From 00:07 - 00:11, you can hear the alpha duck quack, "Get the f*** back inside." This is our reality now. Stay safe!
Is there a sub for videos where the person filming is laughing? Those always make me smile, I would love more of that right now

Many years ago, I saw three ducks walk out onto a frozen pond. They pecked it with their beaks and just seem to be completely bewildered.
"Quack outside quack outside quack cold quack fuck quack back inside quack go back quack fuck quack fuck quack fuck..."
