How do you resist that belly
Involuntary casual tail wags indicate the highest levels of satisfaction.
But for the slow tail flip, I’d say the cat is not alive. 
Cats have the best life. 
I'm so jealous. 
Weird cat toasting by an open fire...
And here I thought [my dog was the Grand Master of comfort](https://i.imgur.com/nsNWCSF.jpg) but that cat has her beat by a mile.
I just want to sleep for the rest of my life
Cat's nuts roasting near an open fire.
For every outrageously comfortable cat there is a dog, just off screen, longing for his bed back. 
Simple yet elegant
My first cat's name was Ashes.  She was a black cat, and when she was a kitten she would sleep in the fire place in the morning because there were a few embers still going.  
'twas the nite before Christmas

n here lies the cat -

just his tail was stirring

laid on his back, flat

the stockings were hung

but the cat didn't care

all he hoped was that He would get

more than his share


“Helllooooooo, cant you seee i need da rubs” -comfy kitty 
The fire looks like a flaming skull.
He wins at life 
Damn it feels good to be a gangster
My old girl gets a [lot closer](https://imgur.com/N1knk5R)...
This cat knows how to cat 
In winter we have to rotate our cat to stop his fur from melting.  We call it rotisserie cat.

He's not overly smart tho(captured and tamed stray, massively stunted developmental growth) as when we used gas heaters he caught himself on fire 3 times.(only small thankfully. We caught it at the melted/fused fur stage, horrible smell)

We use his bed in front of the fireplace too, not for comfort but for letting him know the boundary, otherwise he sleeps right up against the fire guard and catches stray embers. If left alone he gets far too hot to touch, but damn he's happy.
I often envy my cats. I mean stray cats have terrible lives, but a spoiled house cat? Yes please. Pet me and scoop my poop slave. I shall lie here in the sun.
r/thisismylifenow
The casually wagging tail is the best part.  Add a winebottle and/or a joint and this is perfect. 
Where’s the dog who surrendered his bed to the furry, purry belly?
Thug life 
Is this cat available as a life coach??
A human who lived like that would be called a loser, though.
Comfortable, lazy and well fed.
My cat does this as well, right by the fireplace, on the DOGS bed!
Waking up on that first morning of vacation
Talk about being served sunny side up. Man that looks comfy 
This makes me wish I was a cat.
And he probablly has someone that light the fire for him

FDR's lesser known "Fireside Cats"
Use to lie like this at my grandmothers as a kid. Then move after 10 minutes cause of feeling like I was on fire...
At work wishing I was this cat. :(
Man i want to be a cat
Does a fire like that "crack" and can it send small embers flying onto the cat ? seems kinda dangerous if it does
This gives me Calvin and Hobbes vibes.

He still looks annoyed.
This is why sometimes I wish I was a dog or cat. No day to day responsibilities, do not have to worry about paying the bills, cooking dinner or cleaning the house. Basically life would be a beach 24/7. 
Bish, this is me already
On the dog's bed as well.  Classy.
This is fulfilling my wildest hygge dreams 
This is the best Reddit post I've seen in so long. Positive, cute, and inspirational

Slow roasting a cat I see. 
Cat has it made. Lol
This cat is the boss
King rich elite life.
I want to grab that belly! And be shredded to ribbons for doing so
Cat has a better life than me. FeelsBadMan
Both of my cats will do this when we have a fire going. They look so comfy!
He must have a case of the Mondays 
Dog's life my @ss!
"Do what you will, for I have already won."
Life's greatest moments
Can’t stop looking at the chubby face in the fire
This is what /r/catbellies was made for.  ❤️
All the gif needs is the "deal with it glasses" on kitty.
/r/stoppedworking
Must become cat.. Must become one with the cat!! 
Soft pillow, roaring fire, belly rubbed. 

Life is good.
would give my left nut to be that feline rn
When I pass, I wanna come back as this cat.
Link mah boi
I wish there were giants to carry my bed to the most convenient parts of the house.
Wish I was a cat 😒
feelsbadman when a cat is living better than you 
I can;t wait till Tony Baker voice overs this
I like how the bed and the cat both have grey edges and a white center. Like they bought the bed to match the cat's color scheme.
That slow tail wag tho!!!! That cat is super content lol
That’s the fucking life man
Cat resting before Christmas, gaining strength !))
whatever he did in a past life to get here was great
I'm gonna try that right meow. 
Seeing this on a Monday 😢
People don't own cats, cats own people.
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire...
I can feel my stress just melting away.
I work hard so that my cat can have a comfortable lifestyle 
Haha this is me after all day working :D
CATS ARE SO CUTEEEE
Every weekday after 5 
/u/ldawg413
Everyday is Saturday to a cat/dog.
Just once in my life I'd like to be that content.
Fire looks like a cat with flaming eyes. Kitty is basking in the praise of his cat-god.
/u/skullfucckher 
I do aspire to that life. I just don't know how to achieve it.
That little tail wag. 
Thats the tail of a kitty that knows its being watched and is ok with it...for now.
It’s his world, we all just living in it
I bet that fucker is purring.
I wanna be this cat
A house with such a nice fireplace must be super expensive. And this cat is enjoying it for free.
I just wanna rub that belly!
I know people aren't going to like this comment but this is how people describe what heroin feels like. 
It's not a life, it's retirement.
/r/HotPussy (cats in warm places)
Part of me is thinking, "Aww, I want to rub the fuzzy belly," while the other part of me is thinking, "It's a trick. Get an axe."
I think, this is the best way to relieve stress.
Animals have the coolest stress free life unlike us.
r/catgifs
I agree. Sometimes I definitely wish I had an easy life like my pets!
This cat fur sure just ate a big meal
Heat!!! Precious glorious heat!!!
This is the cat equivalent of winning the lottery. 
This is purrfect!
I am so jealous of that cat... 
Monday Vibes 🤙
I too aspire to be a trap for human hands
That fire is raging.
https://gph.is/2cB8DOW
For some reason the bottom half of the gif didn't load at first and I thought it was just a guy really into fireplaces.
Beautiful home
This cat's theme song: [Thundercat - A Fan's Mail (Tron Song Suite II)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8f5CtP0nT4)
Is that cat a maine coone? Mine does the exact same thing on my shag rug.
Cat-Nuts roasting by an open fire...
which sadly reminds me that sometimes.. animals lead better lives than humans..
Fake fire? No way. I want my servants feeding the real thing. 
This is my forever mood
No.   
The life you want has less napping, less TV, and less video games.   

The life you want has meaning.
Yes, I too would love to one day own a home with a fireplace to hang my stalkings. That comes complete with that cat of course.
When I come home cold and tired ..it's good to warm my bones beside the fire
if it weren't for the wagging tail, I would think that cat was dead
I like when gas fireplaces look like flaming faces, gives them character.
Pretty
I'm sure somewhere in this thread there is or will be some one claiming this cat is in some way not ok
Like in Skyrim when you kill a khajiit but their tail is still going strong.
The fire looks like a flaming skull of a cat
other animals should take note on how cats infiltrated society. 
This is basically my life
Living the life I so desperately strive for. Bravo kitty, bravo. 
This is me after holiday dinner every damn time 
This is me after the gym. Satisfying foot wags all while remaining dead on my bed. 
This cat knows how to enjoy the small things in life.. 
Cat.
Speak for yourself.
Can i be reborn as a cat pls
I wish I could just relax like that. I don't have a bad life but I can't just be a cat and be comfortable and lazy and just lay there and feel good. 


*"Cat's nuts roasting by an open fire"* 
i wonder if u/stabbot can fix this
To be able to afford a free loader?

That being said don't go for that belly is a trap.  
I have always said if I was reincarnated I would come back as a cat.
Cats live nice lives in homes. They get a human slave and they just do whatever they want.
Definitely. 
Thats one comfortable looking bear trap... 
My spirit animal right there 
Man I really envy pets
Can I just be someone's pet? I'll be nice when you get home and love you for food.

Life would be so much easier.
Lol
If reincarnation exists, I want to come back as a domestic cat in a loving home. That is everything I want out of life.
I've never felt so jealous of an animal before. 
I want to explore the world, not relax. but life keeps smacking me down with reality
Makes me wish I was that cat.....
Hell yea
A snifter glass with good cognac wold be very appropriate.
Lol
Obviously living the dream!
Easy to do when you've got slaves running after you for your slightest need and a plan to take over the world.
u/caimzz
I'm coming back as that cat!
Lmao

Careful there kitty friend.  A stray spark in that fur will make a kitty go *woof*.
This needs to be the most upvoted video of all time.  It doesn't get better than this, folks.
Touchy da belly?
This particularly resonates with me in the middle of the day on Monday in the office 
Cat: "Fuck it. You win life. I love you."
Its purrfect
/u/ampleaspects
Kitty.exe has stopped responding.
That belly looks like it just got some amazing scritch scratches 
Anyone else notice the fireplace looks like a flaming cat skull? Are we sure this is all innocent and we are not witnessing a bizarre ritual signaling the impending cat takeover of the world?
God, I wish that were me.
Id say thats like the American Dream. As history has shown it doesn't turn out well.
Meanwhile, my cat is catching his tail on fire from a candle on the window seal and just staring at it.
I’m currently laid out with a bad back. This setup looks amazingly therapeutic. I’ll be over shortly. 
Cute
I like my naps like I like my mallows .... fluffy and toasted 
😂😂This is life😂
The fire looks like a flaming skull of a cat


especially on a monday 
I am 50 years old and don't think I've ever had such a relaxed, laid back moment in my whole life.  I can't believe I am sitting here, jealous of a cat.
That cat is my spirit animal
Throw it on fire
ARE YOU FREAKIN' KITTEN ME !!??
BUCKET LIST: 
1. Just this, that’s enough 
I could just watch this all day. So relaxing. 
I need a cat day like this
What an elegant lady!
Wow he looks so happy
Definitely aspiring to be reincarnated as a spoiled, beloved house cat. 
And the cat video gets more upvotes than the spy poisoning news... cats rule. 
Water bomb. Absolutely do not do it, but just imagine if you did.
Absorbing the warms
....have?
You looking for some b3llywork well don't be alarmed, I've got the freaking tools on the end of my arm.
Mine is halfway there.

Thought this was a trash panda until i read the comments. Now i am disappointed 
Already there in human form. 
I've always said if I had to come back as an animal I'd want to be a cat in a loving home. look at that little fucker....I mean just look!!!!
"Calgon, take me away!"
Plot twist: it's a firelog channel on the TV.
Reposting for karma? Nah
Being a human is so overrated
His ancestors are looking down saying.   "You made it!".
Meow meow :3 what a beautiful little love cat
you should also hang some grapes and feed him. 
Flip your cat! Gotta keep it evenly charred!
It's Hobbes!
This is lovely! So relaxing :)
I clicked on the video from the front page and was wondering why a fireplace video got 30K upvotes.  It wasn't until I clicked on the actual comments and saw the whole video in all it's glory. 
Anyone else see a flaming skull in the fireplace?
Kitty is in heaven 
We should all aspire to get reposts to the Front Page?
Imagine having time to lay around and sleep all day.

What most people would give to have this kitty's life. That is one lucky kitten.
/r/StoppedWorking
That's me these days after graduation.. 
so cute
And the award for coziest kitty goes to...."*Cat in Front of Fireplace sent in by -EG-!" Tell him what he's won!*

Nice one
True
I want to be that cat
I wonder if feral cats ever do this or this sort of position is something cats picked up by watching us?
Anticlimactic in the best way
if this is the life we all had the human race wouldn’t last very long. 

if only there was a superior species and we could be their pets. 
Aww that is the life
I think this cat might be a Bodhisattva. I think this cat has achieved enlightenment and now wants to share his knowledge of Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings.
Best thing I've seen all day!!!!!
But with a real fire. :)
Yeah if you’re a lazy piece of shit with no goals in life.
sinister look to it
Except in my world an ember would fly out and land right  on the ole twig n berries. 
You got to be kittin' me.
Now that's life
They missed an opportunity to take a landscape video, stabilize it and turn it into a cinemagraph for a live wallpaper. 
This is a cat lying on it's back in the dog pose. Amazing. 
bro, u can lay next to the fire too. go for it, and take it easy
This is my home guys))Im a King))
I would like to be a cat))
Swish swish bitch.
I'm so envious
I wanna put my face on her belly.
Loll
That looks like a human hand trap if ever I saw one.
LETHARGY!!!
Maybe from time to time, but actually laying down all day is infuriating. Would not recommend.
https://i.pinimg.com/originals/c5/ed/51/c5ed51d5b025bec3105a83978b4d049a.jpg
Cute cat, but why do you have a burning skull in your wall?
If you aspire to comfort then you will always be unhappy. Aspire to find value in challenging or discomforting situations. 
I love how we evolved to worship our "pets" the lazier they get.
My dog loves to do this, to a point where he's sl hot and parched, that he drags his whole body, toungue stinking out of his mouth, to gobble up all his water. Then he'll cool off somewhere cold, and when he's cold enough, he'll return to lay in front of fire. 

In summer, he switches the fire out with the sun. Comes inside to cool off.
Why do some cats allow thier stomachs to be open and vulnerable like this, but others, like my cat, will swat and scratch my hand if I start to pet too close to the off limit belly section?
Fuck, I'm jealous of that relaxation. 
Must.. burrow.. face.. in fluffy.. belly. Cant. Resist. argh..
like a boss..
M’boy, this peace....
I've never reached this level of comfort ever... This cat makes me sad.
Is it just me or does that fireplace look like it has a big skull inside of it? 💀
The cat has achieved Nirvana
If only our cats earned enough to sustain our lives. 
Omg. That's hilarious!
Cats just get me in a fit of jealous rage! 
“Sandra! Cancel all my appointments. I’m going to be here for a while”-Cat 
I wonder if cats like this one are able to feel complete bliss? Are they aware of how good they have it? A life without stress
If anyone was looking for a depiction of pure contentment-  look no further!
Are you selling tickets? I'll take one.
I swear cats have a better life than humans most of the time haha 💕 
I wish that was me right now
Morty could have enjoyed that nice pet life. I am not sure if Rick saved him because he didn't want him to become a pet or he was just jealous.
I'm in a restaurant watching this. The French torch music matches this so well. Lol!
The moving tail indicates that this cat is not entirely comfortable for some reason.
No shame. 
Anyone going to mention how fast those flames are moving?
The videographer is disrupting it's solace...
Give that cat a joint and a pair of bongos and he'll be a dead ringer for Matthew McConaughey. 

He's already got the vibe- that's the hard part.
I have never met a cat who wasn’t a slut for fire. We had a wood burning stove in our basement with a stovepipe that went into a bricked up chimney. I once saw the thermometer on it up at 700°F and our cat was just chilling under it. Her eyes would be half-lidded the way a lover’s eyes get. I was certain she would burst into flames one day. She couldn’t get enough, the *whoor*. 
I’m basically constantly jealous of my cat. I go off to work and he just lounges around on a bed all to himself all day.

*sigh....*
This gif will never cease to make me smile.
I think this cat and i had the same dream last night 
He’s got it made LUL
Spoiled rotten
Yeah man when you reincarnate this is how it's supposed to be pure and pleasurable. 
Yup! So cute!
Sorry
Nigga hes dead
Amen!
my god the toasting
We are reaching levels of comfy that shouldn't even be possible
It's obvious from this GIF that this cat has a much better life than mosy people.

Always warm your frozen cat by the fire.

Full starfish...
What are you talking about? Half of us already sit on our asses and do nothing . . . lol
I would much rather be belly up lying next to the fireplace then at work today. Unfortunately my bills won’t pay themselves yet. Darn things.

I love to firebathe every winter and airconditioner bathe every summer.
If you're good in life this is what you come back as. 
That fine by me
It uses a bed and not a box?! *Inconceivable!!*
What a life 
Yes, we should all live like fireplaces, always on fire.
If everyone wished to live life like this, the world would be a much happier place 
If you want to feel miserable, yes.
But… Is no one going to comment on how the fireplace looks like a flaming skull?

Other than that, yes, 100% totally adorable :-)
I just worked a 12 hour shift.  And I go back in later tonight. This is definitely me right now.
Totally worth being neutered for. Yep.
something’s wrong with your raccoon...
If I owned a giant pillow the size of a king size mattress I'd probably do this all the time.
My parents used to have to drag their cat from the fireplace to force her to cool down. Now they live in Florida and have to force her inside from the balcony. If they don't, she will lay in the sun for days and get sunburn.
You will never know pure happiness like this cat does right here! 
Is it just me or does it look like that cat has a six pack??
When the cat nip too fire
I’m sitting at work wishing this was me right now. 
Does the tail ticking mean it's annoyed?

Cats > Dogs
The title doesn't need "to". 1.) It's not necessary. If you were to drop it, your point would be less wordy and still be made clear.  2.) You can't end a statement with a preposition. It's nonsensical and visually displeasing.
