Your cat has very distinctive ears.  Also, he has detected the Red October.
I like one thing about this cat species. It goes “hjonk” when it meows.

This cat looks so awesome. I'm not really a cat person, but I'd be down for one like this. But at the same time I can see it scaring the cereal out of me in a poorly lit room. So no thanks on occasional heart attacks.
Im interested in this religion

Please tell me this awesome cat does ridiculous things, like being clumsy.
That is an amazing cat! I'm not a huge cat person but what kind of cat is that?
So that’s what a Sphinx cat with hair looks like.

Okay maybe dumb question. I want a cat so bad. I have two pugs and they’d love a cat too. 

I have a small house in LA. 

I can’t imagine always having my doors closed, and I also can’t imagine my cat wandering the neighborhood all day or night. 

Can I own a cat?
If that’s not the real life slinky malinkie I dunno what is
Boy! He is STUNNING!! Tell us about him. Name, breed, age...💜
Ebf anyone?
It's Jiji! From Kiki's Delivery Service.
Bastet was one of the first revered cats in ancient Egypt.  They were revered because they handled rodents, scorpions, and venomous snakes.  Bastet was considered the soul of Isis who may have been the first Madonna which may have influenced Christianity.  [cats in ancient Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_in_ancient_Egypt)

Khajiit has wares if you have coin

Sorry to say but I'd think I'm going to die when this cat sits at my bed at three in the mornin
What a beauty! I love the shape of their faces. With that glossy black fur your handsome boy surely steals a lot of hearts amongst the local cat ladies. <3

One of mine has some oriental shorthair gene and could possibly look a bit like that. Unfortunately he did put on some weight after getting neutered and is too clumsy to play. So he is just an overweight silly goose who follows you around the house, questioning and commenting everything you do, while trying to get your attention. But I love him anyhow.
WOW. What a stunning, elegant boy! I’m not sure I’d be able to take my eyes off him - ever. 

Please tell him EVERY time you see him how handsome he his. My boys, though now somewhat handsome, never fail to hear that and appreciate it well. 

What is his name please?
Nice
I have the urge to worship him.
Bast has arrived to see what the hoomans doin  over there
If cats could be trained, he'd be selectively bred and all his offspring would put every drug sniffing dog out of business across the world.
