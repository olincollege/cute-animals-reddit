IS THAT CAYDE-6 ? ! ?
Run, Cayde! I don't want to lose you again! We can't take the heartbreak!
So Cayde-6 went to the good place, not bad for the original exo.
It honestly wouldn’t surprise me if Cayde encountered some kind of giant space cat on his adventures.
GUARDIAN DOWN, I REPEAT, GUARDIAN DOWN.
"I'm comin' home, Ace." 😭
r/destinythegame
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Kitties on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Felinius Me'owerc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Paws from an Imperial Litter Box just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on my arm.
"Cayde, what's your status?!"

Cayde-6: "...you wouldn't believe me if I told you."
The Deep Stone Crypt looks...different than Cayde described it...
Wow they weren't kidding when they said Shadowkeep was big, this looks great
Cade in wonderland
*Boss music starts playing*
r/unexpecteddestiny
I... hate to be the one to break it to you, but your cat has a drug problem.
Cayde I can’t lose you again😭
Omfg... Plz do a series of these. Monetize it. Tell me how/when/where to support. This is amazing... Fucking ahhhhhhhhhhhmazing
Ghost: This house is haunted by a ghost from The Golden Age. I've read that big cats are ferocius and lethal. Watch yourself Guardian.

Where's Cayde's chicken
So glad to see so many fellow guardians in this thread
Ugh, it's an *action figure* house!
I see a cold blooded murdering assassin here.  The other is an action figure.
r/imsorryjon
So, I guess I will be the one to ask: pic/brand of the dollhouse?

And also, love the staging and the expression of your kitty :)
Is it weird that I can actually see Cayde-6 in this sorta situation?
I kinda want u/Pet_Disneyfication to make them friends.
upvote because destiny.
Can we get an F in the chat for Cayde
Meanwhile in a universe where Cayde survived.
Whether the cat likes it or not it seems it’s stumbled into a war...
Someone write some dialogue for Cayde, I can only imagine what his reaction would be
Whether we wanted it or not we stepped into a war with furballs on paws.
Remember the Fallen.
Me: Wanting to sleep
Cat: Wanting breakfast
CAYDE NOOOOOOOOOOOO
Is that the raid boss we'll be facing?
Why did your wife buy a dollhouse? Why do you have toys? Can I come over and play?
Mom I told you, it's not a doll! It's a action figure!!
not going to lie, for a moment I did not think that was a doll and was surprised by how big the cat was
It’s an ACTION FIGURE HOUSE, mom!!!
Nice cosplay, that cat is huge

“That’s right asshole, my wife just got a new dollhouse.”

r/usernamechecksout
😭😭😭😭 I miss him so much!  Godspeed buddy!!
First glance I thought it was photoshopped with someone in a live actions cosplay... but then I clicked on the photo annnnnnnd dollhouse! Awesome sauce OP!
We're going to see more of these, right? Right?
I like to draw and I have to ask, could I redraw this but with a huge ass Ahamkara or something?
Eyes up, Guardian, Kitty The Ravager of Souls is upon us, may the light be with us both

R.I.P Cayde-6

and on that day humanity received a grim reminder
I'm sorry, jon
Doors and corners, kitty.  Doors and corners.
Can't tell if your wife is a cat and the dollhouse is regular sized with action figures in it or your wife cosplays, you bought a house together, and you have a ginormous house cat as a pet.
You could make a whe seri.....  oh... there we go
Where's Cayde's chicken
Where's Cayde's chicken.
CAYDE!
Please post this on r/photoshopbattles
I bet that's your dollhouse. Own it, man!
Which one is your wife?
Eyes up guardian! There's a kitten to love!
Well ... it’s not Ibsen.
OP should definitely post some of these pics on r/photoshopbattles
r/confusingperspective
This is an awesome photo and this banal pedestrian low-effort sub does not deserve it
You're married to a cat?
Where my destiny 2 players at?
I love you for making this, god I miss Cayde's snark so much, that empty spot in the tower kills me.
/r/miniworlds would eat this up also if it isn't there already.
RIP Cayde.
For some reason that cat instilled the exact same chill as when I saw Momo for the first time. I love cats, but now I know they need to be less big than me.

I love this! My previous cat, Peanut Butter, was scared of thunder and used to hide on the 3rd floor of my dollhouse when it stormed.
For a second i thought this was cosplay in a real house and i got really confused, then i read the title.
The ultimate raid boss.
Update: My wife regrets getting a doll house
Everybody loves a bad idea when it works
r/confusingperspective
This reminds me of something my dad has done recently. I built a scale model for one of my classes. It's a nice little park with a rain garden and 3D printed gazebo. I got a really good grade on it and displayed it on the mantle at home. My dad recently painted a battle tech mech that's the same scale (a hobby of his). So now my park is being terrorized by a 10-story mech.
r/imsorryjon
Cayde! i’m just now doing the final Ace of Spades quest. RIP :(
So... You married a cat?

These new Star Trek figurines are getting real detailed
Go figure.
So I totally know this isn’t related to anything except a vague connection, but my husband does tabletop mini RPGs, and his friends always asked them when I was going to come out and play with them. To which he responded “You guys know what she would do if you had her come out right? She’d play ‘Aliens’. ‘I think we got ‘em demoralized’, ‘They mostly come at night’, making ‘pew pew pew’ sounds at the figures. ‘Aliens’.”

And this reminded me of that because I feel like your wife would ask you to do something with the doll house, and then she’d come home from work to this. Which is fantastic.
