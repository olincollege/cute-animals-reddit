Sometimes I wish dogs and cats wouldn't grow up so fast.

If there was only a name for such a creature.
^(Okay so basically, I am very smol.)
Is this a papillon puppy? Because he looks really similar to my fur baby when she was a puppy.
/r/illegallysmoldogs

He Attac

But He's still a Potat
Hehe, that's adorable!

I have a similar size dog.  I used to worry she'd get stuck 'under".the washer or dryer.  It was 6 months before she could negotiate the stairs!  It was like adopting a gerbil, lol.

Take lots of pictures cause it will only stay small for a little while before he's all grownup!

So Almost a dog?? We had one of those. Went from Huskys to a Bishon and my friend's dad called her Almost a Dog. 

He unfortunately passed before he seen my parents now dogs which are smaller than the Bishon. Wonder what he would of called them!

My companion is 16, deaf and blind and still my best friend. I can hardly believe we’ve been through so much together! He still has ways of letting me know his needs. When he crosses the rainbow 🌈bridge, I know I’ll be a basket case. I love your puppy aka, little dog, enjoy!
thats called a puppy. 😂😂 but honestly too freaking cute, i swear.
He he little baby
I think the word you are looking for is “ puppy”
That’s a ratweiler
Nice ViewSonic monitor box from the late 50's.
Hey, I have that monitor. It sucks.

I think they call those "puppies"
Any dog under 90lbs is a cat, and cats are useless.

Oh, cute puppy, too!
So smol and cute
Smol Floofer
It's called a doggo but a smaller doggo is called a pupper.
Idk why but I thought this was a cat at first glance
I always wanted a dog, up to the point where I dog sat for someone. I didn’t ever want that responsibility! 

Then my SO called me on a Thursday saying he saw some long coated Chihuahua puppies for sale! And that we’re going to see them on Monday. Monday night we got a puppy.. I do not regret it for a second. Watching someone else’s made me nervous, having my own is just pure joy!
A doglet
Aww. Poor little guy, the title is hurtful to him.
I wonder what he's dreaming about.
This is illegal!
Smol
Yes
* smoler
Explain the smolness!!!
THINKPAD GANG
I'd step on it an squish it. But not on purpose.
So basically he's smol
I love mutant abominations of human manipulation. So cute.

Edit: I originally thought it was a "teacup" breed of dog.  

Also, not sarcastic. Human genetic manipulation of animals produces some adorable creatures.
Is that a guinea pig?
Nice
What is he?! A dog for ants?!

Looks dead...
Wait til you find out about Puppies

It’s so little! What kind of dog is it?
Basically a cute living spot on the carpet.
Perhaps it’s just a room, but bigger?
Like my penis then, like a penis only smaller.
A ThinkPad! Clever person!
I love this stage. I only get to experience it a few times, so I treasure every time I can. I love when their fur is so thin you can see all the way to their soft pink belly.
Pretty sure it's a dog
