Atomic clocks... are measured for acuracy compared against Pets stomachs..
One was verbal. One showed it's disappointment with it's eyes. Best not be late again. 

(They are cute AF btw.)
This is going to negatively affect your performance review for the month. Just saying.
The left one is mad, the right one is just disappointed. They might be my parents
There is no doubt that someone is very angry
Nosferatu there on the left is about to learn the taste of human flesh if he's not fed soon. Little Miss Priss on the right is just disappointed in you.
Those are two cute slippers
Yeah, that‚Äôs going to be an official write up for poor customer service. Those little dumplings are adorable btw
I would be afraid if you were 6 minutes late lol they are cute
Worse thing I ever did was feed my cats as soon as I got up for work. They got used to 7am feeding times, and now they come to the bedroom door (closed) and will meow and rattle the doorknob until I get up to feed them. 

They make perfect alarm clocks though. Even if you don't need one.
Itty bitty kitteh committeh would like to lodge a complaint
My persian cat does this too! 5 minutes before he is due is breakfast or dinner he starts meowing like mad. If i'm late feeding him he jumps all over me meowing.. crazy how they know!
Used to have a senior cat that needed medicine in the morning that I gave her with wet food, and while she was a bit flexible, if I tried to sleep in a lot extra compared to her usual feeding time, I'd wake up with a cat on my chest, and in extreme cases she'd whack my face with her paw til I woke up. She was pretty reasonable about it, though - she didn't use the claws.
LPT  if you have to take medication at a set time every day and have a cat give it a treat at the Same time.  As stated above you might forget but the cat won't
"Hooman, when is breakfast to be served????"

"Uh.... 4?"

"Yes, that is correct. Breakfast is to be served promptly at 4am. It is now 4:02am. Is there breakfast?????"

Can‚Äôt think  of any other way to describe this photo than adorably aggressive.
So impressive that they learn so quickly! I give my kittens food between 5 or 6 pm for about a week. One time I had a sick day and lost my routine. At 6 sharp I am suddenly flanked by two smol kittens that don't want pets, they just stare at me silently with great expectation in their eyes. 

As soon as I stood up they rocketed to their plates.
Did they spoke with you manager?
Left: "And you can just forget about going out with your friends this week!"

Right: "I'm not mad, just very disappointed."
One man foot and one lady foot ?
Expect revenge soon, might be one of the following, kitty litter on pillow, plant mysteriously falling off window sill, toilet paper strangely wrapped around kitchen furniture, kitty barf in shoes, lost shoes, missing keys left on counter, socks missing. 

I think you will suffer the last one, doomed to never have a matching pair of socks again, until the day you move, when you will find them stuffed in mysterious places.
I had questions about the feet too but goddamn I am so sorry for all the mean comments you are receiving. I am flabbergasted by the disrespect some people have, wtf. Hope you are above all of this, OP.

Also it's impressive how time isn't really a human construct after all.
People's feet creep me out.
My cat sucks on my finger. Kinda weird ,but that‚Äôs how she likes to get me up.
You have strange feet.
smol angry fluffballs..thanks for the smile that helped me get out of bed!
[deleted]
some people are angry, some are not angry just disappointed. Kitties are angry AND disappointed.
Breakfast was 5 minutes ago! I don‚Äôt see any food! What kind of service are you running!
I bet the left one will hold no grudge against you whatsoever
Omg your slippers are so cute!
[deleted]
If we missed giving ours his heart pill by anything more than an hour, he would come get us and stare as if to say, "Do you want me to die or something?  Get.  My.  Pill.  Human."
"Get the dishes and fill them up. How hard is it Karen?"

 \- The one on the left probably
Im waiting to see a comment saying nice toes
Cats are really good at telling time. Mine wakes me up the same time every morning just before my alarm I just don't set it anymore.
I‚Äôd almost rather get a stern ‚Äúangry face‚Äù my doggo gets bored if I don‚Äôt feed him on time and starts to be destructive. RIP to my girlfriends sandals

This is a fantastic photo btw.
The left kitty looks evilüòê

Are you a guy with girly feet or a girl with manly feet?
Oh they're definitely cats alright.
Our cat has knocked over a lamp and chewed the cord of expensive headphones, destroying both.  A hefty price to pay for sleeping in.
"your performance here at Nintendo is lacking. You were given the job of taking care of us and honestly we are feeling so attacked right now. I'm glad we reminded you as being fed immediately is detrimental not only for us to continue living past this minute, but also for you to continue living past this minute. If this becomes a further issue, disciplinary action will be taken including but now limited to: hard paw face slaps, sitting on your face, The Big Scream‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, and passively ignoring you (except for feeding times) for a week. If you need further assistance please do not let us know."
Spicy purrito on the left, disappointed purrito on the right. Either way, you got called out by some cute babies.
This looks like good cat bad cat during an interrogation
Cat ownership is the best way to quickly learn why it's a bad idea to negotiate with terrorists.

the one on the left is definitely /r/Catswhoyell  material.  They are real cute and smol!  How old are they?  I assume they get on well with each other?
The one on the left is the definitely delivery the iconic Tyra Banks tirade;    

"I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU, WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU. HOW DARE YOU? LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS. WHEN YOU GO TO BED AT NIGHT, YOU LAY THERE AND YOU TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOURSELF, 'CAUSE NOBODY'S GONNA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOU"
One on the left is giving you what for, the one on the right is really disappointed in you.  Both adorable.
One on the right is like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad, just disappointed.‚Äù

One on the left is like ‚ÄúI am! Feed me, bitch.‚Äù
When I visited my sister her cats tried to game the system by asking me for early first breakfast. I tried to ignore them but one literally started slapping my face while I was asleep.
I have never been able to hit snooze again after I got my cat lol
Dogs have owners. Cats have staff.

Did you really need to frame your nasty foot tattoo into the photo?
Are you a guy with a foot tattoo?

Why do your feet look so fucked up?
One meowed while the other tattooed you?
Please, for the love of all creatures big and small, photoshop your feet out of this photo. This is unacceptable.

Well one looks like a r/nebelung and you should feel bad about missing the schedule.
I know this pain.  I started giving snacks before I left for work so the kittens would not attack my shoe strings & claw up my hands while I put my shoes on.  I'm great by all three bitcing cats as soon as I exit the bathroom in the morning.
Jesus they learn fast damn
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre five minutes late fucker!‚Äù

We actually have 15+ cats at home since we started feeding 1 and they just agreed to make our house their base. üòÖ
My cat licks the walls at 3am every morning to feed him breakfast. How do I make it stop!? This is after his 9pm dinner.
I was busy with my friend at the hospital yesterday

Bowser looks mad AF!!
Yeah, ive learned the hard way that if you do anything positive for a cat three times or more with any kind of consistency that they tend to expect if to always be like that forever. Also its impossible to unlearn anything they've 'learned' like this ever.
Right kitten: Bruh... You're 5 mins late.

Left kitten: GOD DAMMIT, AMY! WHERE'S THE FOOD?!?!?!
This is what I imagine the angel and demon on each of my shoulders look like.
I swear for a moment they looked like the cutest pair of bathroom slippers in the world!
I can hear this.

one is contemplating murdering you the other is verbally scolding you
Cat on left: FOOD!!

Cat on right: what is food?? ,üòµ
good cop bad cop
The cat meowing looks angry
I wish my cats understood the schedule. For them, 30 mins early is the expectation and not a moment later.
They are gorgeous. So never forget to provide food on time.
Oh food, oh food, where art thou food?
Demanding potatoes
A well deserved scolding. Haha.
Wait till they start trying to get into the cat food storage
I love how they've went bad cop and good cop üòÇ

They're so cute OMG!!!!!
I can hear that image
My girlfriend and I just got two kittens and they‚Äôre very quiet except when they get hungry. Well, one still doesn‚Äôt make any noise (we call it an air meow), but they get very demanding. I can relate to this picture.
That cat looks like it‚Äôll devour your soul
if you were late for another 5min you'd have lost a toe
They're so beautiful!
Congratulations, human, you are being properly trained.

They are so stinking cute. <3
Kitten sass is best sass.
Aweeeee that face üòÜ
So cute!!! What are their names?
Have fun ina couple of weeks when the clock is changed.
My cat‚Äôs the same, except the little asshole thinks every time I walk in the door is the ‚Äúscheduled time‚Äù and he attacks my legs if I ‚Äúforget‚Äù that 4:30 is dinner time instead of 6:30. 

I‚Äôll get the little fucker a watch and maybe he‚Äôll learn a thing or two.
Our recently adopted cat has also learned our house schedule. Sometimes my wife gets up early for reasons and so feeds her. I wake up and come downstairs an hour later and the cat is howling at me like it hasn‚Äôt been fed. I text my wife and she says ‚Äúdon‚Äôt believe that lying sack of shit. ‚Äú
HEY! HEY YOU! GIMME SOME FUCKIN FEWD YOU FOUL BEAST
I‚Äôm not mad...just disappointed.

FEED ME HOOMAN OR DIE
I give my cats a special treat once a week right before I go out to buy groceries and sure enough there is one cat that follows me around looking expectant if I am slow on the draw of handing it out.

We have always fed my cat at 10pm (9pm when the time changes). You bet your ass he knows *exactly* what time it is. His bitching starts at 9pm. Doesn't matter if you feed him earlier. His bitching starts 23 hours since his last feed and no later.
Omg love the attitude from the one on the left XD <3
Don‚Äôt you mean, ‚Äútoed‚Äù for it?
This morning my cat woke me up at 6. Its labor day so I didnt think I had to get up.
Right Kitteh: Please sir may I have some more.
Left Kitteh: Meow meow muthafugga!
I purposely wait a random amount of time when I wake up before I feed the cat so as to avoid this
Once more I need to remind new parents to cats that dogs, they have masters. Cats, they have servants. They remember being worshiped as Gods back in Egypt and will remind you when necessary
You can tell how angry they are when they are already engaged in loaf position.
You are a kitten abusing fiend!
Nice shoes !
I can hear the high pitched tiny hungry kitten screams on this picture. Demanding and adorable
If you're going to keep starving these poor angels I'll have to take them from you. Tsk, lady. Tsk.

My cat sticks her nose straight into my ear then nibbles on it. Then if that doesn‚Äôt work I get a few paw taps to the cheek followed by her laying down atop my face until I can no longer breathe. Best mornings honestly.
Should've recorded it and posted it to r/catswhoyell
My cat was constantly ripping open food bags when she was hungry so i bought a food container for her. I thought it had a good lid but was wrong since i filled it with food, turned around, took two steps to hear ch clank. She learned to knock the lid off the container on her first try. 

Years later she will still open food bags on her own and knock the top off of the same container. Brat.
I bought an automatic feeder so the cat would leave me alone
Our kittens used to wake us up around 430am because thats when we used to feed them. I then decided to start feeding them after work. Rarely happens now.
Parents confront child about lackluster performance finishing chores. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not angry, just disappointed.‚Äù

This is why cats are terrifying.
They're so cute that even their anger is adorable.
One looks like hells gonna be raised while the other is just like plz feed me.
Mine are 12 years old and know where we keep their food.
If anyone looks at the cabinet with the canned food, they're both sitting at the cabinet, yelling.
The one on the right isnt angry with you, just very disappointed
In my university days, I had a cat that expected breakfast promptly every morning. No problem during the week. I fed the cat when I woke up. 

The weekends, though.... If I tried to sleep in, the cat would jump on my bed. Sit by my face and stare at me. If I didn't magically feel her presence, she'd reach out a paw and pat my face. 

*...pat, pat, pat....pat, pat, pat....stare....pat, pat, pat....*

If I *still* didn't wake up, the claws would come out.
You monster!!! Feed that starving animal before it wastes away!

We thwart this by free feeding dry and feeding wet only evenings when the dogs are being fed. One of ours needs miralax daily, so we dissolve it in her wet food. The other just gets a feeding because what one gets, both must get. His is missing the extra ingredient though.

Please crop out your feet next time.  This isn't a women's ugly feet fetish forum.  I was about to eat breakfast, now I think i'll pass.
I taught my kitty when he was young to sit down and be patient for his food. He's so well mannered now =)

I think you have learned rather quickly to be on time with their breakfast. They've trained you and made you believe it was the other way around
They look like cute fluffy slippers, lol.
They are so angry.
Cats have a very good sense of time. They learn your routines. It‚Äôs quite funny.
Watching my mothers cats, one gets fed 6:30AM and if I haven‚Äôt fed him, he‚Äôll let me know.

The other one eats when she feels like it, she has a big bowl of dry food she eats out of.
Oh no! Angry hungry kittens! D:
Provide sustenance human! NOW!
the cats are cute
These literally look like my cats 19 years ago...
Same fur and everything !
Now I want cats
I hope that I have a cute cat like yours
That's something I never understood. Why wouldn't a cat owner just feed their cat late at night, so they wouldn't bother them first thing in the morning?
Is that a stock photo or a tattoo
First thing I learned when I got my cat was don‚Äôt stick to a feeding schedule. Once she started meowing outside my bedroom door every morning I decided her feeding times would be anywhere within a 2 hour period rather than first thing after I wake up.
My mom's cat used to start complaining nonstop over an hour ahead of feeding time, driving her crazy. And then when he finally got it he would take barely three bites and walk away.   
I don't feed mine at exactly regular times (maybe approximately within a certain hour) and my cats have never behaved like that. She tried to vary it a bit as well and the behaviour stopped after a few weeks.
I was scrolling really fast and they looked like a pair of kitty slippers
My cats know their schedule. They won't stop annoying us about getting it an hour early.
/r/noisyjpgs
Just wait until they decide that schedule needs to be earlier
I think the left one is going to eat you if you don‚Äôt feed it quickly
Nice Slippers
He looks absolutely ferocious
Auto feeder saves me from being clobbered.
You can't let them walk all over you like that! Oh, wait...
Ungrateful bastards.
One cutie pie on the right, one demon-looking snarl on left! Pretty gray!'
This is like my cat except that he asks for his food an hour before the schedule.
I used to feed my cat when I woke up in the morning so he started waking me up. When he started asking me for breakfast at 3 am I bought an automatic feeder. Now he just nags that all morning. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre hungry? Go ask your machine if it‚Äôs time yet, I have no role in this process, buddy.‚Äù

I like cats! Cats are actually the best animal of all times. I should know as I am probably the one person in the world that knows most about cats. I once sold a house to person that had many cats. More cats than anybody. Everybody says that I know most about cats. Under Obama nobody liked cats. Nobody not even sleepy Joe. Now everybody, thanks to me love cats . Cats are now better than EVER.
So anger
He‚Äôs got a surprisingly deep meow for such a tiny little guy.
They start meowing when you're 5 minutes late? Mine starts meowing 2 hours beforehand and gives me a reminder every 5 mins or so. Like an alarm clock you can only snooze.

(definitely not underfeeding her btw, she used to be a bit chubbier so we cut back her food and she maintains a healthy weight now. Probably just needs to be fed smaller amounts more often, but my schedule doesn't really allow for that atm)
Good strong **M** there on the right foot cat.

How small are your feet?
Just got my 2 kittens 3 weeks ago there both 4 months old :D
This is why from day one the kitties got used to having a large bowl that is usually full at all times. So they eat when hungry as they please. This way I only get yelled at if they hear the can opener as tuna juice is a favorite treat!
you have the next 20 years of this shit.

Great, OP. Now they‚Äôre going to starve.
Mine jumped from top of the shelves and landed on top of my chest. It felt like I was given a chest compression.

Itty bitty cuties. Mine will give me a break on a late breakfast but he will yell at me if I serve dinner late.
Kitty demand food now
Why include your feet though? Tarantino, is that you?
It's like Gizmo and Stripe.
Keep your gd gremlins out of the picture folks!
Wow you were 5 minutes late, I guarantee next time you try to be a minute or 2 late you‚Äôll feel the claws without the scratch it takes a few days to progress to the scratch and loud yell. They are gorgeous
I think you need to feed your fluffy slippers
Soooo cute! Cats also have a mind of their own when they want to. My 13 yr old cat certainly does - yelling 5-30am onwards when breakfast time is 7am.
There are two kittens inside you. Whichever you feed grows stronger.
Lol. My cat starts meowing, then if I don't wake up, she attempts to knock down everything in the room.
^a ^n ^g ^e ^r ^y
My cats remind me of themselves always one and half hour before the dinner time. 1,5 hours of repeating purring and howling. It's hard to forget not to feed them on time ;)
Nah ‚Äî those aren‚Äôt cats, those are your slippers that look like cats!
Mine is trained to know that I wake up for work at 4. He‚Äôll scratch at my door until I come out and it‚Äôs not even for food! He just wants me awake.
So cute!
My mums lab will start barking at 5pm on the dot and continue barking until he sees his food bowl, then does it again at 9am.

I'm guessing the one on the left is the fiesty one. The one on the right is solemnly disappointed in you.
Cat is currently screaming at me. Already fed her
You‚Äôre in trouble... ooooo
One on the left wants you to know how angry he is. One on the right just wants you to know he's not mad...he's disappointed.

oh my god that angry kitten face is adorable.
That‚Äôs a cool tattoo!

I‚Äôm a heavy sleeper that works nights. I‚Äôve made it a point to feed my cats food and treats once I wake up in an effort to turn them into an alarm clock. So far it‚Äôs working
My cat will scream even way before it‚Äôs time
Haha this is so adorable! I have five cats, and they all know exactly what time is breakfast! I was woken up this morning (10 mins early!!!!) by somebody ramming my bedroom door.

Forgive me!
I gave up sleeping in twenty-something years ago.   I'm up at 6am EVERY day because if I'm not, a clowder of cats attacks me whilst meowing loudly.
Or may be it's the feet without a tattoo, which upsets the kitty..
1 minute away before your cats eat you
Mine do the same thing lol
Mine jumps on my bladder. She's figured out that I have to pee first thing in the morning and her aim is deadly.

Hahahahahahaha aaaaaaww there‚Äôs always one loud mouth in the group.
The disappointment and rage in the sassypants‚Äô eyes
Cuties
I got woken up this morning by a tiny dog bouncing on my pillow, so he and a giant dog and mid-size dog could go outside and bark.
You look like you‚Äôre about to put on your fuzzy  slippers
Karen give us the foods and no one gets hurt
One of these boys is an angrrrrryyyy boy üòÇ
My cat bites me, or will chew on the electrical chords or anything that will get me out of bed. He's been at it as early as 4.30am the little shit. Lucky he is cute and I love him. I have resorted to putting him in the crate until a more reasonable time though, he must not be rewarded for biting me.
Cats always know the *minute* you're late with dinner.
My cat's not that bad, but once we went out back and he beat me with jumper cables.
Your cat slippers are very life like. Where can I buy a pair...?
Very cute.
No doubt they know.  Our orange boy starts knocking things off the nightstand in the morning when my wife and I try to sleep in on the weekends.
He scream.
Yes. The felines are not precisely what one would call patient with their ugly hairless apes.
They‚Äôve gone all good cop / bad cop on you
You monster.
Babies gotta eat.
It's your own fault for getting them watches.
Local cat servant abdicates duty. Will stand for her crimes at trimewnal
They look like slippers
How dare you? üôÄüòπ
Cute pair of slippers
Khajiit has cuddles if you have breakfast
I feel like I really lucked out. I adopted the sweetest one year old torti-calico mix. She's social, had a collar on and so may have once been a pet, but also had her ear clipped so must've been a stray at some point (they clip a single ear of stray dogs and cats here once they've been spayed). The first couple days she was very clingy but two weeks later she's more affectionate if anything.

If I sleep in a little she won't wake me, she'll come and lie down next to me, not make a sound and patiently wait until I wake up, then she'll come over to my face and lick my nose gently. Once I'm up and the bowl is in my hand though she's one loud girl.
That cat on the left would like to speak to your manager!
My cat started eating at about 7:00 AM when I took him in from the street.  Over the years, he gradually wants it earlier and earlier.  Currently waking up at 4:45 AM to feed him breakfast.  He‚Äôs an asshole, but I love him.
**PROVIDE ME HUMAN!**
At least they know the schedule. Our oldest starts loudly asking for dinner up to 90min before their usual time...
That'll teach you!
My cat is always 1h early :C
Mr White on the right is playing good cop; he's not mad, just disappointed. Mr Grey on the left,  however...
Furry, lazy, OCD martial artists!
Those kitties remind me of my Stella and Rocky! One grey, one grey stripes. Gorgeous kittens and I love your little paw tattoo!
They‚Äôre not mad, mind you. Just... disappointed.
There's always the innocent one...
love! love! love!
Unfortunately mine used when the sun came up as the time for getting up. Meant I did not sleep much in the summer. Especially since part of the routine was me being there, I had to get up even if there was food in the dish from the night before. Also 100% worth it.
Someone got food after midnight. Poor gizmo
When my wife and I adopted our cats we both had to at 7 am with 45 min commutes.  Cats got fed around 5:30am forst day and boom that was breakfast time.  We work rotating shifts but still had to get up at 5:30 every day to feed them. Automatic feeders help.
Out of curiosity, how old are they
To quote Costanza:
"Guys with cats......."
My 5 month old kitten always thinks it's time for her lunch time wet food
Bowser looks SO MAD lmao
Wow. Such anger.
My cats eat at 7 and they've been used to it since they were kittens. Hard part is day lights savings throws them off and they start an hour early for months. Then when we drop back an hour they're shocked to be eating "early".
Nice slippers
Those would make awesome slippers. I only thought of it cause of how the picture was taken.
I can hear this photo
Do your job, hooman!
I only READ half of it and thought you gave them breakfast if they licked your feet

 Don't question me
Cool slippers brah
My cat screams and claws at the bedroom door every single morning around 6a. Can't sleep in on days off
Angry mom, disappointed dad
I thought the cat had lips.
Yep, my cats' clocks go off at 7pm for their evening treat.  Little jerks won't let me be a minute late.
I demand to speak to your meownager
Bowser looks like one of those stuffed animals that makes the evil face in this picture
Those slippers look soft. But BEWARE!
I love it when the cat/dog is Soo excited and whatnot. Fill the bowl and watch them eat waaaaaaaaaaay too fast and then puke it all up like 5 minutes later so they can eat it again

Oh they're the best.
They‚Äôre going to hate daylight savings
He boutta square up
We are slave of cat and they are our boss since the ancient time :p
WhErEs me *Breakfast* Labowskie?
An automatic feeder saved us from the banging on bedroom doors in the middle of the night because of "hunger".  But i get this stare-down  if I'm not on schedule after work with the moist food.
they look so cool ,cute and innocent  !!!
Meeee too
Do it NAO OR I SWEAR HUMAN
The old good cop bad cop routine
/r/noisy_jpgs
This is why you don't feed cats \*breakfast.\* Feed them dinner. And/or invest in an automatic, timed feeder. :)
Are you by any chance from upstate New York? Your feet looks identical to my husbands feet except that he doesn‚Äôt have a tattoo. And I think you might be related
oh man, the one on the left is MAD
OMG I thought they were slippers for a second!
Best thing i ever did was get an automatic feeder.
Disappointment
for a second I thought they were slippers. they are so cute!
The one on the left looks angry, while the one on the right looks disappointed in you.
Big, big mistake feeding your cats from counters and or the fridge. As someone with two cats for 15 years you'll regret it
They're even using good cop bad cop on you.
That's a cat for you. I just adopted a cat a month or so ago and he begs me for food an hour earlier than food time (like almost on the clock so it's like he knows but feels he doesn't want to wait).
I imagine they point at their watch and meow loudly at you
I scrolled by and thought this was a picture of someone putting on slippers
Why am I so dumb.  I thought those were slippers at first.
Your're lucky that the claws aren't out yet.
your middle finger toe is bigger than your index finger toe. incredible.
Furry slippers are getting way too realistic
What about 2nd breakfast?
r/NotSoSneakyBackgroundFeet
"your fucking late, asshole!" "Mmhm"
The one on the left is very very serious.
I have to say I thought they were slippers when I first looked...
The left one is the rowdy one, the right one is the quiet, shy one!
On a brighter side, they‚Äôre just big enough to wear as slippers.
Oh my goodness the one on the left looks so angry! üòÇ
r/SneakyBackgroundFeet
I must have a defective cat he never wakes me for food only for cuddles.
Soon that 5 minutes will be 2 hours of them constantly under your feet every time you make a noise or movement that could possibly maybe mean you are about to feed them.  So cute!
they are rules like a Swiss clock
My cats start acting up. Clawing the mattress, going under the bed to pick at it, jumping on doors etc. All the things that warrant a chase down.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs me, dio!!‚Äù
show cute kitties
Left cat looks very angry
Who walks with cat food in their slippers?
They are starving you monster!!
They look like slippers
Weird slippers!
That left one is so mad! Be afraid!
The cats will remember that.
Nice tat
Same goes for my cat. I have 2 alarms in the morning, one to get me up a little and the other to get up completely. My cat will sit on my chest between alarms and if I don't move, I get an earful.
angry hamb
That cat on the left is an asshole
You monster how could you starve them like this?
Taken at the right moment
Heard it in this voice:
https://youtu.be/V92tFAFvgEE
Goddamn I thought those were slippers
Thought those were cat slippers for a bit
"Mother, we require sustenance"
Kitty on the right isn't mad, just disappointed.
It is like when you have done something to upset your parents, one of them is lecturing you, the other is just looking on disappointedly and silently agreeing until it is their turn to lecture you.


Best of wishes to you and your feline overlords.  Mine didn't even let me sleep in until the normal time I get up in the mornings on most days.  They've been getting more wet food lately and they didn't feel like waiting.
Playing the old Good cat, bad cat.
My cat woke me up by doing chest compressions on me. When his dinner was late on a sunday. https://i.imgur.com/lbZAthm.jpg
Wait until daylight savings time change.
Chop chop hooman!
I wouldn‚Äôt mess with that kitten on the left!
You're lucky. 
I get two dogs that pace the room. Claws clicking on the hardwood floors. 

Then a cat that sneaks up the side of the bed, searches for and attacks any open skin on your body.
Cat 2: "I'm not mad, just disappointed."

Cat 1: "I'm mad."


Also, I love the foot tattoo!
What is the breed called?
They look like my parents, my dad always yelled at me while my mom just stared at me disapprovingly.
The cat on the left is the best
The left one looks like a future serial killer.
They where like : Im the bad cop , your the good cop! And we will make him pay for every second.
Should get an automatic feeder. It‚Äôs life changing
A N G E R
They can wait an additional 5min if they're gonna tell at me.
Table for AAAAHHHHH and awe
They are like my mom's kitty, my grandparents don't let her sleep inside so every morning she goes to my mom's window and uses her plate to knock on the window if I dare to be a minute late to get her inside and give her breakfast lol

Subsequently she learned that I'm the week hooman and if she meow in my direction and give me love she'll get more food.
You chose kitties that go with your flooring! Double trouble in a dim light üòÇ
/r/choosingbeggars
He looks SO angry!
*angry as fuk*
What means brain has a time function.
looks like tarantino movie
Morton‚Äôs Toe
You should invest in slippers in case one day you re 14 min late..
nice toes
r/catswhoyell
I WANT MY FOOD MEOW BITCH, I SAID MEOW 

If I don‚Äôt feed mine on time because I‚Äôve overslept or something, she literally climbs out the window and comes back with a bird in her mouth. I cannot even count the number of times she‚Äôs done it. She doesn‚Äôt even eat it though, she just leaves on the floor next to my bed  and I honestly think it‚Äôs like a revenge hunt just to annoy me because she‚Äôs so pissed off for being hungry. 
Btw her name is Puppy and she‚Äôs a little bitch kitty
Those are some nice fuckin kitties.
Mine fling themselves against my bedroom door if I'm 10 minutes later getting up than usual. I've only had them for a month, lol. Can't skip breakfast in my house!
The Graymalkin seems to be yelling at you like mine does! :D
I thought these were fuzzy slippers at first.
r/photoshopbattles
I've often wondered whether cat food is physically addictive. Is there any against it?
Getting licked by those furballs would be the best feeling ever!!
At first glance, I thought they were slippers.
The cat on the left looks like a bat ü¶á
The one on the left is the one to be reckoned with. The other one is just along for the ride.
Cute!  My cat does this too.  He also knows when he's allowed to go outside (on the dot) and when it's treat time.  And people think dogs are smarter...I've got both and it's my cat that reminds my dog of play time, nap time, food and treat time.
Funny how the left one looks so pissed off and the right one it's kinda disappointed.
Three months ago I got the sweetest little kitty from the shelter. She loved being picked up and petted all day. After about ten days at the house, she turned into a terrorist. You can occasionally pet her but mostly she'll try to playfully bite you when she sees a hand approaching. And her play bites huet. She is constantly ambushing and biting any ankles foolish enough to be exposed in her domain. The worst.... She is completely housebroken, spayed, but everytime she pees in the box, about halfway through peeing she starts to raise her butt up in midstream, often soaking the wall. Yes, I've tried covered litter boxes, larger boxes, extra ones around the house - nothing. That's just the way she pees. I have to literally hold her butt down(gently) while she pees to avoid this. I love her, but I swear I think someone switched out cats while I was sleeping. I love her but she's clearly related to Satan.
r/forbiddenslippers
Slippers?
Me standing next to my mom while she yells at the waiter
Nose boots and burrowing cannot be stopped by covering your head with a blanket
My word.,.how ferocious the left one is, with barely-there teefies üòç
I thought they were house shoes for a second.
Without reading the title I thought you were going to wear them as slippers üò®
Left cat wants their food, and wants it *NOW*.

Right cat is disappointed in you as a person.
j'accuse !!
Feed the patient one first
They are so precious!! üòªüòª
Well that‚Äôll learn you!
Smollest complaint
Dude on the left looks so angery.
So much morning cattitude.
My cat from long ago used to wake me up by gently biting my nose.  I'd wake up grumbling and she'd run to the bedroom door, squawking at me to come let her out.  If I went back to sleep, she would immediately return to the bed, peel back the blankets and bite me harder.  And repeat.

I loved it.  I'd often pretend to go back to sleep just to make her try harder.  It was our little game.  She was a black cat and vanished on Halloween.  It was incredibly devastating. 

My current cat doesn't do any of those things.  Won't cuddle.  Won't sleep on me. Won't sit on me. Nothing.  She meows when I walk by.  And visits when I use the bathroom. But she hates being held.  

So I've got a cat and yet I am still very lonely.
Your right foot and my right foot match!

Where the fuck is my breakfast, Karen?!
Totally off topic but can you tell me what breed that gray cat is? I feed a stray everyday and it looks exactly like the disappointed one in picture.
r/catswhoyell
üòÇ what are the kitties‚Äô names?
At least they're not like mine ... They goes meowing and making sad faces like 1-2 hours before their meal time that hasn't changed for a while ...
Tell those cats to give you a pedicure while they‚Äôre down there.
"Feed us hooman!"
Constant meowels punctuated with a one claw tippytap reminder.[Luke](https://i.imgur.com/BJd09qx.jpg)https://i.imgur.com/HF1EHre.jpg
Typical! One is mad, this one knew you weren‚Äôt to be trusted.  The other clearly expected better and now is disappointed in you.
Never feed cats in the morning.  Dry is left out all the time and wet only in the evenings. If you feed a cat in the morning you will never sleep in late again.
I love this picture. Takes me back to childhood! Thx
What i love about this picture:  same problem, different responses.
Your feet don't match
this is why my family has a general time to feed him. once in the morning, once at night

dry food tho is just whenever its empty enough
I‚Äôm trying to understand this... do you sleep with tight socks on and take them off when you wake up to walk barefoot? 

If the sock marks doesn‚Äôt fit you must acquit!
Quite squeakily, I would wager.
There‚Äôs lots of these types of posts in r/CatsWhoYell  and it‚Äôs making me believe that cats have very precise internal clocks
i can haz ur feet???
I just learned this but with kitties I guess it‚Äôs better to just have a constant supply of food for them to eat as they are young, otherwise they won‚Äôt know how to self regulate their food intake.
Nvm the cats. The feet!
my cat always does this to me
thats like.... CUTE!
honestly that's adorable I wish they never grew!
It is very nice to watch cats in the morning.
I don't think you're going to be late ever again after you cats reactions
They are so cute even when angry!
These fur babies are absolutely adorable
üòñüòÇü§£
the darker cats looks angry
I want my cat to have tattoo too...hashaa
This Meow thing works better than any alarm in the morning
Well, what are you waiting for?   They are hungry too!!!
Angel and devil
It always impresses me how accurate their biological clocks are, like, I am a bit jealous.
