The web on the stairs got me laughing
It‚Äôs all fun and games until someone accidentally kicks the poor dog out of fear
Australians be like ü¶∂
this is absolutely terrifying
Hilarious: yes

Safe: no
I remember this!

So funny and cute...poor doggo was probably sad that everyone was running away while he just wanted pets! Lol
This is older than internet, it's SA WARDEGA, polish guy mostly known because of it.

Original video on his channel:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoB8t0B4jx4
in /r/aww ?
Not trying to be a party pooper but I definitely know some people that would probably throw something out of fear. Hopefully the little thing was able to have fun without any issues

edit: this is okay with friends, etc. maybe just more dangerous with people u may not know
His name is Sylwester Wardƒôga. He became the most famous youtuber in Poland after this prank.
This is horrific. I'd be beyond scared if I saw that.
Poor dog just wanted to be petted
r/aww? More like r/awwHellNo
Bwahahahaha.  I would be afraid of the pet meeting it‚Äôs demise.  However this is gold.
This is so old. Look up Wardega on YouTube, he did this in Warsaw. Yes, there was a lawsuit. The first video in the montage isn't from the original, since it's US style housing.
Don't do this. My fear of spiders will overcome my love of dogs and fight or flight will be triggered. Likely fight.
Chaotic evil
If I saw that at night I would run Hella fast too
Not enough time to fix my quick rc car but next year I will be doing this. Better yet use a cheap one I don‚Äôt want my good one smashed. This is gonna be fun.
That‚Äôs how you get your pup punted
ü§£the elevator oneü§£
I would have had a heart attack or died from shock.
I‚Äôd rather not have my dog get sent into orbit by someone‚Äôs boot
Haha wow! Kinda cool to see a guy from my country on such a big subreddit.

This is a part of that's guy's most popular video. This thing got him mad views and it was even referenced on that year's YouTube Rewind.

In the corner you can see his logo "SA Wardega", which is his name ("S" for Sylwester, the "A" is for his second name I guess, "Wardƒôga" is his last name). It's also the name of his main channel.

He was often called a Polish Remi Gaillard and also accused of copying his content.

He is currently making commentary videos on his second channel (with quite a big success), pointing out the falseness and vanity of Polish influencers.

He also participates in fights of a Polish MMA federation, called "Fame MMA", created specifically for Polish influencers and celebrities.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)The lift scream is amazing ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
That's the funniest shit I've seen in awhile, thank you.
Scripted but funny because people think it isn‚Äôt. 

Not /aww though. More /funny 

can barely see the dog.
I'm sorry I love dogs but I would have kicked the shit out of it of I saw that running at me.
Prank from 7 years ago

https://youtu.be/YoB8t0B4jx4
Dune (2021)
This is fucking terrifying.
What an amazingly easy way to get your dog killed
Good way to get your dog hurt or even worse tbh. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing this in certain places.
Nope. Nope. Nope.
Funniest video in years. My cheeks hurt
I would kick that thing if I saw it running at me ngl

kinda dangerous
How to get your dog injured
This whole time i was just feeling bad for the dog, he just wants to get some pets, possibly some treats, and all the people run.
My god if that was me I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôd have stomped the fuck out of your poor dog
It‚Äôs all fun and games until your dog gets bashed with a shovel
This is one video I am happy is reposted year after year.
Fuck that‚Äôs the best. I‚Äôm laughing so hard
Holy shit...
Someone who actually used loose correctly
That elevator one was golden lol
Aww?  More like AAAAAHHHHHHGGGG!!!
yeah bro thats a polish youtuber sylwester wardƒôga and that was about 7 years ago
I remember this from years ago. It was super viral at the time.
He would be kidnapped and taken home so quickly
That is both creepy AND funny.
Even though I know what it is I am getting shivers down my spine watching this
The dog at the beggining isnt even the same dog! The other dogs costume is brown and way bigger than a lap dog.
My man was getting chased by a giant spider and decided the best course of action was to run into a giant web, smh
That looks so scary omgg
If I see this I just die instantly
Wow this is vintage
Wanna get your dog punted? Let me show you how.
An oldie but a goodie.
The spider web, though lol
The video is fake or the dog would get kicked
That‚Äôs so evil, **I love it**
I would probably die if I saw this irl. Or get high on the adrenaline rush.
Those are two separate videos. Different breeds of dogs and even the costume is completely different. A lot of the footage is from one of those hidden camera prank shows, so the dog wasn't actually roaming around unattended.
OH GOD GET THE FLAMETHROWER
Genius
And this is why muffy was set on fire.
Why would you run into the spider webs on the stairs when a giant spider is chasing you???
Best laugh today, thank you - though clearly staged
I hope nobody kicked him
Laughing so hard at this I woke up my husband. I love how stoked the dog is to see people lol
ü§£
Good boy gonna be traumatized for the rest of his life.
So.... where can I buy such a thing?
That's terrifying
This is older than reddit
Poor little dog. Just wants to play.
This is actually next level lmao
This shouldn't be restricted to halloween, let this little guy loose dressed like this any time of year
Oh wow, I‚Äôd get into so much trouble with that
Hmm
Is this aww or ahhhhhhhhh!
Holy shit that's scary
I'd run to the nearest aiport if this was in Australia.
Best thing I have ever seen.
That is fucking hilarious
All I can think about is how disgusting that elevator floor must be.
This is hilarious
Jesus Christ lmao
Man I needed that laugh üòÉ üòÄ üòÑ üòÅ ü§£ üòÇ  thank you kind stranger üôèüèæ
It never gets old..
I think that's a really bad idea. The poor little dog could get hurt by someone that gets startled by him. I think it's ignorant :(
All jokes aside this is actually horrorfying when being the vicitim
this video is so old!! and still funny
Lmao this is horrifying
TARANCHULA
I‚Äôm sorry but if I‚Äôm high and it‚Äôs dark and I see that ‚Ä¶
Isn't this a couple of years old already?
I hope no one hurted the dog cause of fight or flight response
I would def stomp out the dog on accident.
Epic prank get pranked most foolish indeed
This would give me s heart attack
Not gonna say their owner is a fucking moron, but I'm not gonna think twice before murdering the shit out of that thing if it ever caught me off guard.
Funny but a sure fire was to get your dog killed.
That would legit scare the fuck out of me
Hell to the nah
Kind of sad for the dog, doesn't understand why people are running away when he wants to make friends. Poor thing.
This is more than 7 years old...
I am not ok with this
I know that if I ran into that I would sue the owner for every penny I could get.  It would probably give me a heart attack or at the very least traumatize me for the rest of my life!  

And if any of you think ‚ÄúGood hahahahahah‚Äù   you are just cruel.  Some of us cannot handle being scared like this.
The most feared thing of all, spiders!!!
Love it but I can see something bad happen to the dog if startles wrong person
No doubt I would shit my pants. No doubt.
I need one for my cat!! Where can I get one? ü§£
THIS IS NEXT FCUKING LEVEL. I would be scared shitless
Funny but a good way to get your dog hurt.
To whomever you are, sadistic doggo parent...

I love you.
‚ÄúHELLO WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE MY FRIEND‚Äù *horrified screaming*
This pure gold. Nice touch with the webs and props. Really sells the prank.
How to get your dog killed 101
Thanks for giving me my first laugh of the day.
Just dont get suprised if your dog gets kicked
I dont think my brain would function properly if i saw this thing coming i would 100% do something stupid like attack it or throw a chair at it or jump onto a moving vehicle to escape it i dont know.
Blooming hilarious. Love it.
SA wardega , has alot of fun stuff on yt
"Someone" is shorthand for "I know who, but I'm pretending I don't."
Some people are seriously afraid of or allergic to dogs, it is not cute to let them run loose on people.
Jesus Christ burn the building down but save the dog
That dog probs like ‚Äúam i not cute? Why everyone running away from me all of a sudden???‚Äù
Sorry,, Lil doggie would be DEAD!!!
That is so fucking bad. Fucking horrible, damn that puppies life is in serious danger. That is freaky as fuck.
i need a mod for skyrim that replaces all spiders with dogs in costumes
Yea its all fun till someone grabs taser or just decides to kick him.
This is ten years old..
Dog: "why does everyone keep running in fear from me?"

Dog: "because they cannot handle my extreme power"
Meanwhile, SpiderDog wonders, ‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt anyone love me???‚Äù
did that spider wipe his feet at the front door?
Like 35 years ago
BRO I WOULD SHIT MYSELF SO MUCH THAT THE SHIT WOULD REPLACE THE PANTS
Spiderdog prank by SA Wardega on YT. He we was in national Polish news because at the time this was by far the biggest video by a Polish YTuber
Since op did not credit the original vid here‚Äôs the link to it. It‚Äôs made by a polish youtuber. 

https://youtu.be/YoB8t0B4jx4
this is very old youtube content, back when creepy pastas and stock images where consideres decent content... damn i was whole heartedly scared bc of this videk back then
That's the best ting I ever saw on social media. !!
Are you kidding me, that should be illegal lmao
Thas..... scary
That‚Äôs mean as fuck
I remember watching the video for this when I was a lot younger and genuinely thought it was a real thing and had nightmares over it
It‚Äôs all hilarious fun until you startle that one guy carrying a concealed handgun. Don‚Äôt do this in Texas :(
I will just die there
It's all fun and games until that one redneck draws a gun....
That dog is so smart and cute lol those people look hilarious ü§£
From far away it might convince me, but for how close they are how anyone can't tell it's just a dog in a costume is beyond stupid.
I‚Äôm getting my dog one of these! She‚Äôs a pomapoo. Perfect size
THE CHAOS
Omg .. this is an awesome costume lol
Chaotic evil in a good way
this was from a viral youtube video back in 2013......  so much nostalgia
My heart will skip 5 beats
Fuck I could watch people getting scared by something like this all day.
This had me CRYING. I need more!
welp, time to start working on my dog‚Äôs costume for next year
Is there a place I can buy this
I know it's staged, but I'm can't stop imagining someone kicking the shit out of that dog or opening fire on it.
It‚Äôs all fun and games until the police arrive üòî
Gotta find one of these costumes in St. Bernard size. My kid's friends have parents I hate.
MUTANT KOPEK GERI DONMUS
It makes me think: what if spiders actually have the same cool personality and disposition as dogs, and they're just misunderstood by us humans just because they look like hairy 8-legged 12-eyed mini-monsters
Jesus‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs how you end up getting a new dog.
Good way to get your shit dog stomped
That seems like a good way to get your dog kicked
Very lucky that dog doesn‚Äôt get double footed curb stomped.
Absolutely brilliant where can I buy one for my cat?!!
That's a good way to get your dog kicked through a fucking field goal
That's a good way to get your dog kicked
But you shouldn‚Äôt let a dog off leash like that I thought
This video is forever funny
That‚Äôs a good way to get your dog hurt if someone tries to curb stomp a giant ass spider
Somebody is going to kick that dog like a football
You want a dead dog? That‚Äôs about how you have one
I needed this
Leash your dog asshole.
This is as old as the internet, FHV?
It‚Äôs funny but I don‚Äôt want someone to panic and kick the poor thing
Just spent 4 minutes laughing my ass off, and triggered an asthma attack - well done, HELLA FUNNY üòÇ
Fortunately nobody was wearing a gun lol
Am wondering what would happen if you did the same thing but with an all black newfoundland. So basically a 160 lb spider....
Where can you get this? This is amazing
Funny, but suddenly worried for his safety.
Omfg I'm dying this is genius. Especially the web at the end
It‚Äôs hilarious.
But I also worried about the dog get attached by someone who is really lost it.
I haven‚Äôt laughed that hard in years! I‚Äôm crying over here! ü§£
I'll be singing Spider Dog all day long.  I can't imagine what I'd do if I saw it running toward me, lol!  Great costume.
So creepy, yet so funny, freaked me out,üï∑üï∑üï∑üï∏.
One of the most hilarious videos I‚Äôve seen! Can‚Äôt stop laughing üòÇ
Honestly i would have kicked that thing so hard and that would be completely the owners fault
This wins the Internet for the day!
Someone is going to stomp on it
Big man got stuck
There was a small dog running the streets in my neighborhood a couple days ago in a banana costumeü§£ if my boyfriend didn‚Äôt take a pic I never would‚Äôve believed it !
Menace
Old but gold
Boo
Good way to get your dog killed
It‚Äôs funny but the dog could have gotten hurt.
now imagine someone taking their gun out. the poor dog
You gonna get your dog killed.
Very old but legendary clip
Hmmm‚Ä¶we have 13 puppies at the moment‚Ä¶ü§î
Ahahahhahahshshahahaha üòÇüòÇ
Potentially dangerous for the dog. Irresponsible of its owner.
Good way to get your dog hurt
Good doggo also terrifying
That dog is gunna get punted into its next life.
I would have stomped on/kicked the dog in fear
I couldn't stop laughing at that. Wtf. I'm going to hell
‚ÄúIn this first generation, the original male also produced a queen, and together they will construct a primary nest which the queen will guard. But eventually, she will create reproductive offspring of her own. And when that happens, this town is dead... and the next town... and the next town... and the next one, and so on.‚Äù
Fookin GOLD!
The dude laying in the elevatorü§£ü§£ü§£.
Time to roll up the newspaper and give it a good ol' double tap.
Yo, this is so old, that dog was in youtube rewind... I think 2014 lol. Still cool af though :D
I have lung damage and in the middle of an asthma attack today. My son just came in to check on me because the awful sounds I was making while laughing sounded like I was dying or crying hysterically...

This video is one of the best things I've ever seen.
Clips seems short, it there more of it?
Great editing!!
These spiders don't have web coming out their butts
That's awesome!

Why are all you acting like you never stopped to pet a tarantula? They are like the teddy bears of the arachnid kingdom.

(Edited to show proof)

Omg the elevator AGH
[Link](https://youtu.be/YoB8t0B4jx4) to the original video with terrifying "spider"
Oh, but to walk your dog on a leash like this...
[deleted]
I dont run, its against my religion. But if I saw this Id run so fast.
wow really reaching back into the archives for those clips from 7 years ago, huh OP?

This video is from 2014. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WiR2VE-gm4
Yes and his name is Remi Gaylord, he's been doing a lot of public pranks for over a decade now.
Fake and gay
That would make me literally want to beat someone unconscious
If only there were some field of study that could equip a human brain with the knowledge that no spider is three feet across.
That is great!  I want one for my girl now
Thats awesome
OMG that is the scariest costume for so many people! A winner!
This is the funniest thing I've seen all week. Absolutely Brilliant!
This is so awesome hahah
Just laughed and hope to Never see this.
Man I think I might be more scared of spiders than I thought that cause that was straight terrifying for a second. 

Also holy shit the one in the elevator.
How crazy would it be if spiders could bark tho fr.
I thought the elevator was extra but the one with the web took me OUTüòÇü§£üòÇü§£
This is hilarious. The dog standing on a body in the lift is excellent, doors open‚Ä¶.eeeeeaaarrrgh!!!
Imagine if this was real and The dog just wanted to lick people but they ran away from him/her
Oh gosh I laughed so hard!! But in real life I would flee!!
Wow haven't seen it in years, it's like 10 years old video.
Wonder if the dogs knows he‚Äôs scaring people or if he thinks it‚Äôs just a game.
This is amazing
I'll do this next year but just in my house laughing my ass off the whole time
This is top tier

The elevator scene and spiderwebs were perfect lmfao
I wonder how many times someone called the exterminator?
I'm gonna need to wear the brown pants.
I would have a coronary immediately
It's like Ant-Man: There's somethin' wrong with that dog!
That's awesome!
I would've a heart attack if I saw this
The elevator was the best part imo.
Wat da dog doin?
This was a popular YouTube video many many years ago
That's just wrong!
This very old clip is never not funny‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Oh sh!t the elevator! Genius
This would scare the hell out of me if I saw it in the wild. Love it!

Hahaha‚Ä¶yeah‚Ä¶that dog could have been yeeted. Funny until he gets hurt from someone panic kicking it.

Thats a good way to get your dog kicked by someone without control
Damn this video is old.
It‚Äôs a barking spider
uh, you know some a-hole's going to crush it right?
Funny, but good thing it's staged. Would have been in asshole thing to other people and your dog if they let him run around unleashed like that.
I know its all fake, but this is the costume I wanted for my pup.  My wife veto'd because its too scary lol.
Lmao! Awww, that was awesome!
That is great!!
Repost
This is pure evil.
r/skyrim thats a good Frostbite doggo
Hardest I‚Äôve laughed all month. r/bettereveryloop
Me who isn't an arachnophobe:
Haha!! I love this
This is a pretty old video isn‚Äôt it?
I saw someone put one of these on a german shepherd once.  The nope was so visceral i folded in half (and i'm fucking Australian)
This is what happened when people have too much time on their hands, they put a giant tarantula costume on their dog and let him/her run loose. LOL. It's still funny as hell to see men dropping their bags scared shitless thinking they've encountered a colossal mutant spider and girls screaming and running away terrified thinking a giant mutant spider just killed a man in the elevator.
 yeah WHY AGAIN IS IT ON r/AWW
Why is this shit on this sub.
Not gonna lie, I would have a heart attack if I saw that thing coming at me
The web! üòÑ
The giant enemy spider
Old but gold
An oldie but a goldie
I think I heard a man named Karl talking about this on the phone.
This is gold, Jerry, GOLD!
Oh thanks for the laugh!
r/PublicFreakout
I need one, I don't have a dog, but when I get one I'll need one of those.
This video is old. and the first part isn‚Äôt even part of the original prank video
That would scare me too
Oldie but a goodie lol. Still makes me laugh. I love the crrrrrrr sound they add a d then the scene that comes right after the girls.
This is a darksouls boss
Cute
Jesus the elevator was prime lol.
I always see videos like this and think "they god they chose flight and not fight" cause I woulda punted the fucker and then ran for my goddamn life
Isn't this old? I remember watching this on YouTube years ago
Australia explained in one video
It‚Äôs all fun and games until you scare someone so badly they get into their car and slam right into the dog.
We call our dog spider a barking spider cause boy can she smell like one from time to time
Lol that is hilarious.
I put one of those costumes on my dog a few years ago it was absolutely hysterical
I didn‚Äôt let him run loose though I was walking him and people still freaked out like crazy
So hilarious! Helplesssly guffawwwing!!!! Thank you I really needed a good laugh!
What a great idea for a costume for a dog .
I would freak out before the dog either barks or I hear the panting (‚Ä¶spiders don‚Äôt pant right?) then I would laugh
The giant enemy dog-

#SPIDER
This is absolutely fucking delightful
‚ÄúSpider-Dog, Spider-Dog, doing the things a Spider-Dog can‚Ä¶‚Äù
I would die
Day. Made.
I would die instantly from heart failure
LOL LOL I have never laughed so hard. I would most definitely be running away from that thing too.
Wow. That is hilarious and terrifying.

Please post more. I‚Äôm dying over here
Nah I‚Äôd never do this shit to strangers, not because I wouldn‚Äôt want to scare them but because I wouldn‚Äôt trust strangers not to panic and hurt my dog because they‚Äôre scared 

Tbh irresponsible, what if someone had a gun or even just kicked your dog out of terror? Not worth it just to go viral
This is such a terrible idea. Funny but a good way to get your dog hurt
OH MY GOD I REMEMBER THESE VIDEOS FROM SO LONG AGO
Ahhhh shit!!

Id be too scared someone would try to squash my doggy
I‚Äôm absolutely terrified of spiders and yet this is hilariously cute...... I am so confused.
Is clips been circulated more than Kim Kardashian
That is fantastic. I‚Äôd be a little worried about doggo getting stomped on‚Ä¶.
I'd be so scared someone is gonna happy Gilmore my dog into another plane of existence
Seriously tho, that‚Äôs putting your dog in some serious danger, I would definitely kicked the living shit out of that or run it over‚Ä¶
This is very cute but someone's gonna call the police, and well, most know how well that'll go.
Old old prank video
I hate to rain on the parade but that's a good way to get someone to kick your dog.

As opposed to the alternative where the dog found it and put it on himself
OOOOOO I remember watching this as a kid
Omg ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)

I had a nightmare last night about a spider and this is the first post I saw after waking up.
Best shit iv ever seen XD. My sides are hurting from laughing.
Oh god not the webs. This guy set up a whole damn labyrinth in the time it takes for a stranger to tie his shoes.
One of my favorites
 The itsy bitsy spider‚Ä¶.
I‚Äôd be worried someone would harm him.
This is so funny! üòÇüòÇ
The clicky sounds of it walking (dubbed in?) reminded me of the Garthim in the original The Dark Crystal
This is absolutely fucking brilliant and hilarious...
i‚Äôm scared
Good way to get your dog killed‚Ä¶
That's soo rude.. I'd die of a heart attack.
even if the whole thing was staged? that is great
That‚Äôs fantastic üòÇüôåüèª
Until someone kicks the dog out of existence
Super cute but I really hope no one gets to scared and gets hurt or hurts the pup.
This works so well with uncertain smile by the the
While I‚Äôm sure the setups in this are fake it‚Äôs still hilarious!
lol so badass
Hilarious!
Cant stop laughing.  A good way to wind down today
Ah yes, Wardƒôga. He hasnt dome any pranks for ages now, just commentary stuff
I‚Äôm on the floor üò≠
It‚Äôs a wolf spider
This video is so old
Where do I obtain this costume
This is the first thing in 1000+ posts on this toxic website that made me laugh, thank you
what is more like r/blrusstinge
Omg I'm dying, give me oxygen please üòÇ
Holy shit this is terrifying. I love it
Holy hell I haven‚Äôt seen this video in 10 years!
I worry for the dogs safety. Whenever you watch a show where people jump out in costumes to scare people someone always gets punched.
I hate this one because if it were real someone would kick that dog- the idea that this inspired people to try it for real is really worrying.
The first time poland was ahead from america (this video is like 5 yrs old lol)
Best thing on reddit today

I gave to say that I‚Äôve seen this video maybe 10 times this week and I LOVE it!!!!!  It‚Äôs hilarious and SO darn cute!!!  Can you imagine it running toward you in the dark or dimly lit area??  Too funny!!!  üéÉ
This video is so old and yet I laugh every time

I made a spider costume for my 3lb rat dog. Can not wait!
That‚Äôs absolutely hilarious!!!!!!
On one hand this is fucking hilarious and had me in stitches.  On the other this could be potentially very dangerous for your dog if those were strangers.  You never know who's instinct is going to be kick the giant "spider"
It‚Äôs just a wee poodle
Whoever thought of that is a genius. An evil genius.
I actually felt my gut turn.

Actually scared me, oml. Have my orange arrow.
People is freaking out!üòπ
I swear this video gets reposted E V E R Y halloweenüôÑ
Lucky a cop didn't see, they'd light that dog's ass up
Aww? That's terrifying.
This is great!
They should be happy that some enterprising member of society didn't take a sledgehammer to the spider
That is hysterical I never laughed so hard in my life. That was great. I‚Äôd like to see some more of that.
The reactions are so fake, dude this is just dumb.   Whole thing is set up.
üòÇ
love how this is on r/aww
That was hilarious!! Here, take the only award I have to give.
Cute, but the scenes all look super fake.
Best thing I've ever seen
My 7 and 5 year olds are cackling in delight
Holy shit that's genius. And an absolute riot.
Good way to get your pet killed
Awesome!!!!
GENIUS
Awwwwww hell no.
I didn't see the title at first and my fight or flight response kicked in before I realized what it was haha
I'm glad they only did scripted takes. This would end very badly for the dog if they did this on actual unsuspecting people.
I almost peed myself LOL
Nice way to get your dog killed
Shit went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick.
10 years ago
NO
I could imagine it going south if someone panicked and instead of running away, they kick the dog instead.
Lmfao
Classic
Roftlmao, this is brillant.
No way this isn't faked, someone would've hurt it no doubt.
It's all funny till the guy at the door packs and smokes the dog.lol
Admit it- you‚Äôd be running for your life if you saw that as well
The BEST dog costume I‚Äôve ever seen!!! üëçüëç
Genius
I was laughing so much but i would be terrified too haha
Classic Wardega
 yeah f*** that noise I have Arachnophobia I'm not trying to lose my mind over a dog probably won't hurt me
Wtf- üòÇ
Hot damn 2010 flashbacks.
He just wants to be friends :'(
If I saw that running into my house, I would freak tf out üò± So cute though ‚ô•Ô∏è
I would die
It‚Äôs too small. I need one for a 90 lb. dog.
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This poor puppy must be wondering why everyone ran away from him üò≠
/u/mrsstuckinpa need for our dogs!
An old video but still makes me laugh
Reminds me of that thing in Dune.
These things are always staged.
Gonk
Someone as in the cameraman
Where when and how can I get this
Fuck no
Old as sin.
He's lucky he didn't get kicked
Please,  enlighten me, why is this funny?
This year he's an Ewok, next year he's a big-assed spider.
GENIUS!!!
Freaky to see at night! Cool!
This is terrifying.
It took me a minute to realize it was a dog and not some robot.
That‚Äôs a dog that would definitely get kicked at some point. Someone is gonna lose their shit.

Laughed so hard I almost choked....
Yo, this is one of the funniest videos I've ever seen.
Genius
This is awesome. I wish my cat would allow a costume like that.
This is absolutely golden, made my day.
This is the best!
This is fucking hilarious
Good one
Great costume, but I'd yeet that critter if it came running at me so could be risky.
Pure evil
Whoever created this costume.  Thank you.
Truly üòà; I fell out of my chair laughing so hard.
Makes the rounds every year, but never gets old. ü§£ü§£ü§£
I would actually die though
Bro this is hilarious af!
Ha
Mother f ...get me that dog and costume designer asap üòÇI‚Äôve got a list of teachers to scare üëª
Someones gonna die running from that
My mother is severely arachnophobic I'm pretty sure she would drop dead if she saw this literally
That dog's owner is an anarchist
Always a favorite
Great way to get the dog injured or killed, freaking out strangers like that.
the only tolerable spider
This is the same guy that did those "clown smashes a dudes head with a giant hammer" videos like 5 years ago right? Those camera angles look very familiar
Omg. This is the best..
I hate spiders, but is the best dog costume
this is genius.
I laugh but I would absolutely pee myself with fear, too.
That is awesome on so many levels.
I have loved that a video for so long! It‚Äôs my favorite. üòÇ
I could watch this all day
Where is that costume from???
I‚Äôm fucking dying rn!!! This shit is too funny!!
Looks like it escaped Giedi Prime just fine
This video is older than Netflix
Probably scares the hell out of the dog. All those people yelling.
Thats a good one bc I promise spiders are my biggest fear and seeing one that sizeüòÇ
I really really hope no one kicked that dog
This shit is funny as hell. I can‚Äôt stop watching this! üòÇ
Rude/Hilarious
The actors were all really good! üëç
That spookie
&#x200B;

![gif](giphy|10JhviFuU2gWD6)
I want to do this in a bigger scale to stray dogs
Inappropriate behavior because it creates fear in people
People in Australia wouldn't bat a fuckin eye.
That's funny. So Gdamn cute .
Mojojojo would be proud.
Omg imma üò≠ lollllll
LeL
Hope that dog has pet insurance....
Poor pup just wants some pets! Probably wondering why everyone is running away/screaming. üòÇ
If you‚Äôre ever feeling stupid, just know that out there today there was a person who watched this and didn‚Äôt know it was staged.
Hope that dog doesn‚Äôt run into a police officer
r/oddlyhilarious
That‚Äôs real funny until somebody punts your pug in horror.
Blow torch time
Anyone worried about a spectator kicking their beloved dog in reaction?
r/TIHI
Priceless. Best laugh I've had in quite a while. :-)
r/somehowterrifying ?
The two people at the elevator made me burst out loud.
I have a bug phobia (yes I know spiders aren‚Äôt bugs just roll with it). I would have either died on the spot from fear or beat the living crap out of that dog from fear.
This is a repost that *I willl never get tired of*.
Okay so that is...legit extremely funny. But also extremely dangerous. Odds are good I'd have grievously injured either the dog or myself if that happened to me late at night.

Unless I just keeled over from a heart attack that is.
i need to see when they find out it‚Äôs a pug
180 million views on yt
why the fuck is this in aww btw? that dog is being fucking endangered in case the victim gets violently defensive
Haven't cry laughed in a long time. Seriously, thank you :,,D
Its cute and fun, until someone carry a 45. ACP‚Ä¶..
that would freak out my spouse and my youngest!  I was cracking up at the spider costume!
Someone is an evil genius.
I want a monke version of that
