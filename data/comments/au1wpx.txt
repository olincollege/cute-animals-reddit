I like that they both feel like they won the lottery in both pictures.
My great aunt married an African American in the 50s and was disowned by the family. When I was a teen she lived less than 15 minutes away from my grandma (her sister) and my grandmother refused to even acknowledge her existence. I was written out of her will for reconnecting with my great aunt. She's a lovely old lady who is absolutely obsessed with cats.
My oldest aunt married a black guy from Mississippi back in the 70's and I never forget the story that my folks, who were from NW Minnesota, told me about my grandpa and the time he took him on a hunting trip in the middle of nowhere.  Must have been a site to see, an old heavily accented Norwegian with a very dark man from the south roving the field of nowhere MN and it was a chance for them to bond.

Makes me smile today knowing that even though there some real prices of trash out there making it look like we haven't advanced at all as a society, at one time a Norse mechanic and an ex-boxer from the deep south in the early 70's were out chasing deer.

Side note, he and my aunt ended up having beautiful daughters, nothing like Creole black and Norwegian to give you great skin and angular features, that part of the family was out in CA until only recently they moved back to the same pocket of MN.
Man that's wild. 65 years ago, she got kicked out for loving dude.
I am Black and Asian. My wife is German, French, and Scottish. All of our friends said that we would not make it. Today we are celebrating our 18th Anniversary. I know it doesn‚Äôt compare to Mary and Jake, but it‚Äôs a great start! I am so happy for Mary and Jake. They helped pave the way for people like u/suicidebetty and me! So thank you for that!!
Who kicked Mary out and from where? Both photos are great.
Imagine how hard it was for them back then. It had to be so difficult.  I don't think you could have a relationship like this in southern states and be safe back then. Congrats to them, its really a milestone
It‚Äôs like this for my aunt and uncle. She was disowned by her family for decades and they are in their late fifties so not that old. Shit is not that uncommon y‚Äôall 
>Now it‚Äôs very hard to comprehend the prejudice we encountered, but you have to remember that there were hardly any black people in Britain in the Forties. I met Jake when he came over during the war from Trinidad, as part of the American forces stationed at the Burtonwood base near my home in Lancashire. We were at the same technical college. I was having typing and shorthand lessons and he‚Äôd been sent there for training by the Air Force. He was with a group of black friends and they called my friend and me over to talk. We didn‚Äôt even know they spoke English, but Jake and I got chatting. He quoted Shakespeare to me, which I loved.

Sweet
Jake reminds me of Leon Bridges
Interracial still has hardships even post70s.  Best of luck to the couple for enduring pop culture psych and staying together despite the cultural vicissitudes of time.
Dealing with issues in 2019 as an interracial couple, all my hats go out to you both. This is the true meaning of love ‚ù§
Based on her wearing a chai around her neck in the more recent photo, I am guessing her family are Jewish. For shame if the disowned the own family member for loving a person of colour. 
Gorgeous couple 
That is a beautiful love story written in their eyes. 

My grandma's sister had an African-American child. Her husband and she were white. (1930s). They took the child to the doc as they couldn't figure out why that child was so dark completed. Doc told them to wipe it down with bleach. From what gram said, the entire family adored that child (most beautiful child in our fam gram would claim.) They had no clue. Silly idiots!
When I was a teenager, I dated a half white / half african american guy (who looked mostly african american). My mom was very unhappy about it and made pretty passive but unpleasant comments like, "You wouldn't really want to marry a black guy, would you?", even though he was a really nice guy.

Years later, I dated a white guy who treated me like absolute garbage and my mother hated him. She grew a lot over the years as a person, too. After 2 years of a shitty relationship I had moved to Japan to study. I ended up meeting my husband while I was in university there. We fell in love, dated for 3 years and got married. He is the sweetest man I've ever met, treats me like a princess, tells me he loves me and that I'm beautiful all the time, etc etc. My mom absolutely adores him and always talks about how cute we are together.

I was lucky that my mom changed as a person. She was never aggressive about her racism and certainly would never treat anyone poorly for their race but she made it quite clear that she didn't find other races, particularly african americans and asians, to be attractive or marriage material. (She never seemed to dislike hispanics that much for some reason unless they were "ghetto". I guess because most of them have light skin and can pass for white? Idk....) In the end, my mom admitted that she had bad views and they weren't right and that she's happy to have changed as a person to accept everyone as they are.
Beautiful couple! One day the world may learn that love has no color... 
He was killing it in that suit
What a beautiful couple. Then and now.
Same almost happened with my mom when she married someone with melanin, and the result is most of the family thinking she was out of her mind or a‚Äùacting out‚Äù for attention. Needless to say, we totally cut ties with most of our family except some cousins and my grandparents who still wanted to be in our lives. 

Mama wasn‚Äôt  married 65 years, mind you, but disownment wasn‚Äôt really an option for my grandparents so they sucked it up despite being huge racists at the time. Crazy how people can even ‚Äúdisown‚Äù their children in the first place. The thought disgusts me.
My dumbass just now realized the reason interracial elderly couples are rarer than young interracial couples is because they weren't allowed to get married/ be together in their youth.
Mary still loves Jake. Her smile says it all. 
They have the same exact smiles after all that time!
65 years? Now that's love ‚ù§Ô∏è they are an inspiration! 
The fact that they got married 65 years ago makes those two amazing heroes. Cheers, indeed!
Wow...65 years. That‚Äôs pretty amazing. Marriages don‚Äôt last anywhere close to that nowadays 
How GREAT does it feel when you say you‚Äôve been together 65YEARS?!

I‚Äôm proud to say ‚Äú30‚Äù...
Good on you, the rest of the nay-sayers don‚Äôt count and mean nothing.

No matter relationships or who they are.

Good vibes only, may your day be as pleasant as you are!

Such brave people. Love seeing this.
Hardcore fucking awesome 
Wow they look even happier after 65 years! Just looking at them makes me smile! 
Damn fine looking couple and I'm glad they found each other.
when you made a decision and realize how right your decision was üòçüòçüòç
That‚Äôs beautiful. My Dad was disowned by his family for wanting to marry my Mom (they got engaged after 4 months). They‚Äôll be celebrating 49 years together this June. He had his close childhood friend (and his wife) serve as our aunt and uncle, his friend‚Äôs Dad our grandpa. He gave me and my brother an amazing childhood. Plus he was able to retire early and set up an education trust for all 5 of his grandchildren. I tear up sometimes thinking about the example he and my Mom set about what it truly means to love. I am a lucky man.
Apparently I'm a pessimist because my first thought was "what if she got kicked out for him and he didn't love her back" when I'm literally looking at pictures of a happy marriage
What a gorgeous couple! Oh the stories they could tell! They should write a book about everything good & bad that happened in every decade they were married.  
60 years ago this was illegal. Remember it was just 60 years ago. Brown vs board of ed over turned separate but equal. 
So next time you hear some one say, why they cant just be like every other american. We people of colored didn't have the chance to be it. Until 60byears ago
*does math to figure out what year they married*


oh... oh damn.
**Kicked out from where?**
Kicked out of what?
I‚Äôm in love with this
I hate racism! Who cares about skin colour, religion, etc. Love is love. 
Cheers!  Those two have been through some shit together.
Love wins.
To be married for 65 years is a major accomplishment.
My aunt is a white woman, and my uncle (who is black) were not treated fairly by my old fashioned grandmother. She used to not let them sleep in the same room when we visited her for holidays. I love him like my own flesh and blood. I still have pictures of him holding me as a baby. How anyone could disown, push away, or reject someone because of their skin color baffles me. Let's all love one another as equals. 
You GO, Mary and Jake! Well done!
Jake looks like Leon Bridges
Kicked out of what?
The look on Mary‚Äôs face is priceless. 
In both photos. 
Beautiful couple. Fuck me tearing up on early morning Sunday
Okay, this lady is a beast, she literally followed her heart when it could have meant absolutely fucking death and nightmare. Superhero level self-esteem and courage.
Kicked out of what?
Yay for love and yay for that wedding dress!
That's what is love
Love is love 
YAY love !
Another ten years and we'll say it's a serious relationship.
#<3
How fucking cute does Jake look in that first photo. Man I'm a dude who's married with two kids and I'd try and get with Jake.

Congratulations to them both, they make a wonderful couple.
I love this love so much
Regardless of race, that is what I want(ed). I mean, it's already too late for this kind of pic, but I'd love to meet someone who loved and accepted me the way these two seem to.
Brave, strong, and beautiful!
Is this the 65yr challenge? 
Mary has a million dollar smile! 
Congratulations to all of you in mixed marriages or relationships. Anyone who can't accept that you love each other seems a little shallow to. Best of luck to all of you and your families.
I bet these two are a hoot to be around. Good for them!!
So beautiful, then and now!
Okay I have a theory. It's probably a stupid theory, I think most couples who go through major obstacles and adversity to be together end up lasting longer. Something about a shared traumatic experience makes the bond stronger I think. 

I've never been in love unfortunately, so I may be taking out of my ass.
My parents were lucky that their relationship blossomed post star trek kiss.

They were both big star trek fans actually.
never forget to sort by controversial for your daily dose of douchebaggery 
Damn I‚Äôm glad their love persevered. The best revenge is a life well lived. 
My best friend's mom didn't go as far as disowning but there was definitely a lot of fights, negativity, and shitty commentary because she was dating a white guy. She's African. So much so that she almost broke up with him to make her mom happy and make it all stop. She stuck it out because he ended up proposing. They're married now and just had a kid but it wasn't until the baby was announced that her mom finally came around.
Fuck racism. Glad this couple took the risk and followed true love.
Kicked out of what?

awwww,, this is so nice. Cheers to those who have fought to have the love they desire against all odds!
Aww I love interracial couples!
Her smile got even better :)
She looks so giddy and genuinely happy in both and I love it.
Also: fuck bigotry
Thank you *Loving vs. Virginia*

Sorting by controversial.  Wish me luck.
My girlfriend was kicked out for dating me. They don‚Äôt approve of me age (6 years older), think I‚Äôm a piece of doo doo for not finished college, but yet I own my own house(almost paid of), my own car(almost paid off), make 70k a year. They wanted her to date guys they choose and she didn‚Äôt want that. Sucks that she has to go through that with her family but she‚Äôs happy being with me and that‚Äôs what matters
They‚Äôre so cute!!! 
Beautiful couple.

I love them both. They look vibrant and happy. 
Makes me smile. Love is love ‚ù§Ô∏è 
Like a good wine, cuter with age.
My grandmother had my father and his siblings taken from her until she married a white guy. She was lucky enough to have found a good guy who let my grandfather see his kids from time to time. But they were forbidden from revealing his paternity until my great grandmother passed away. Sadly it was only a few years before my grandfather passed too, so in the end they never really got to know him or their heritage. 
This is beautiful!! Love conquers all!!!
Very heartwarming u/naughtykteacher
It's this kind of story that really puts the whole "love wins" movement into perspective for me.
üòä these two pictures made me smile.   I‚Äôm happy now.  
Big up Mary and Jake 
Love is love.
Cheers!
Happy as the day the met.
How fricken cute are they???

I love stories like theirs!  Reminds me of the story of my great grandparents.

Living in Virginia, great grandpa met a woman and they fell in love.  Disturbed at the idea of their daughter marrying a black man, her parents moved them across the country to South Dakota.  My great grandfather, a freedman of some means followed them, and married my great grandmother much to her now broke parents' dismay.
Here's the scoop:

Really cool pic!
Either he shrunk, she grew, or that hat hid a lot of hair (they are still adorable)
Jake from State Farm?
Bless!
Young Jake looks like Leon Bridges!
An adorable revolution.
Oh I adore them so..
This makes me feel so happy after a lonely week. Thank you.
I would like to see a sitcom where they are the quirky old neighbors. They just look so happy. 
They both look so cute!!!
I love LOVE!
Literally looks like the relationship just keeps getting better and happier. I love this ‚ô•Ô∏è

Her smile is gorgeous in both photos. Full of joy! 
Seeing posts like this restores humanity a little bit more in these crazy times of ours. The bravery it took for them is astronomical. The Definition of love!
Tristan Thompon is the modern day version. 
Beautiful.
Jake on the right looks like the kind of guy who's gonna ask me if I know about shining.
What an amazing story! To go through that kind of adversity and still have that much love and passion for each other! This warms my hart and gives me hope for humanity!

We all come from the same people.  I come from Welsh and English ancestors.  My husband has some Indian in him. My kids are beautiful.  We are all mixed somehow.  I don't understand the bigotry. 
Yo wtf the black guy turned into an old white woman and the white lady turned into an old black guy
Those people who dissavowed this couple surely missed out on a wonderful couple.  Hoping American interracial relationship anxiety continues its slow burn to nothing.  Cuz thats what it is.
I‚Äôve been with my husband 11 years. He‚Äôs black I‚Äôm white. My grandmother still has issues with it and doesn‚Äôt fully accept it. 
Love is love no matter the color. 
I couldn‚Äôt imagine though what it must have been like with societal pressures back then. 
She is beaming! Love is awesome.
That took a lot of courage, congratulations.

This is so ridiculously dumb. I can't imagine kicking someone out because you don't agree with the person they love. If the person isn't abusing them or taking advantage of them who gives a shit. They love who they love. 
he went from will smith to bill cosby
I am happy for this Jewish woman. More Jewish people should race mix and Israel should open their borders to promote it :)
So sad.

My grandma was an Irish immigrant in Canada, my grandpa a Barbadian immigrant. Irish immigrants were put on the same "level" as black folks those days, so there was no contention on her family's part thankfully. Now they have adorable mixed grand and great grandbabies like me ;)

Also, he looked like Leon Bridges when he was younger!
Fuck anyone who is racist. Fuck all racists, just let them be miserable failures in life. While couples like these two will be happy, successful, and loved. 
They both look so happy after all these years
Hell fucking yeah! 
My mother was German Royalty until ahe married my African American father. Shes an amazing woman and i love her to death.
I can't even imagine the courage that took back then. Fuck.
Fuck this karma farming bullshit. It‚Äôs so blatant
You cannot snuff out the flames of love.
I knew Leon Bridges was sent from the past.

I sympathize with Mary and Jakes hardship love through the previous generations.  This is... usually... puppies and bunnies and stuff, put some bunny ears on Mary.. Social Justice is is cool anywhere like the pet forum.

God bless Mary and Jake for 65 years of hardtime matrimony.   Bravin prejudice, racism, bigotry, feudal kinship, oppression.  65 years these two did it.  Here's an upvote.  Social justince in the pet forum. \\m/

Was it worth it? Married for over 6 decades tells me it was more than worth it. Soulmates.

This makes me happy :D
I hope to live to 65 
What a beautiful couple 
this made me smile. thanks OP. 
I have an old lady friend who told be before she passed away her son cut all contact with her when she married a Chinese man. It was a second marriage for both of them.  They were happily married for many years before he passed away. When she passed her son was notified but he refused to come visit her before she died and the funeral. Her daughter in law through the years did secretly send her a card every once in a great while with some photos of her grandchildren.  I was always sad for her when she talked about son and his family. 
Her smile is so charming, I wish both the very best! :)
1000th comment don‚Äôt mind me
Interesting, named Mary but wearing a chai necklace. Maybe she was taken in by a righteous gentile during the Holocaust.

Yay for love!!! ü•∞üòä so adorable 
Then you have the tweet from the angry black woman '90% of black men marry black women, don't let those Cheerios commercials fool you'.
I'm gonna marry who I please. I will not date a black man who tries to date me because I'm white, or one that puts down black women. I've met men like that and I won't tolerate it. 
But if a black man and I truly fall in love I will marry him no matter if we look like a Cheerios commercial or not, and no matter WHO it pisses off. Because race doesn't matter, and that means everyone, every single person in every color should acknowledge it. 
Aww, they look so happy together! 
Extra strength and endurance, love.
This makes me sooo happy to read.  Admire their courage and commitment.  
nothing beats love
Kicked out of what? 
I know my great great great  grandmother was an Irish woman. She was with a black man and was disowned from her family. I don't know my Irish side of the family. But as a black girl she made me truely believe love is blind because I don't think I'd risk my family for love. 
I adore courageous women. I have a weakness for them.
In a time where white people hated black people and vice versa these people found love.

Incredible, cheers for a longer marriage.
They'll never last
From my extensive search results comprised of vast man-hours of work (basically I looked at these photos for a bit!) I can conclude that these are a wonderful couple and Mary in particular is a smashing fun gal!
What an adorable couple both then and now.  
It kinda looks like she's wearing a jewish necklace too 
Race is a cultural construction. Colour is real. But colour is just pigment. We are all the same species, the same humanity. The baggage of colonialism and slavery, all the lies told regarding race - white supremacy - are entirely without base. We are the same humanity.

This does my heart a heap of good!! I've always hated that people have kicked out, disowned, shunned, etc. the people they supposedly loved just for loving someone. Many bigots lay the blame God & their religion for  their actions. I'm not the really religious type, but it seems to me that if God is a truly loving entity then HE/SHE would approve of ALL love whether it's between 2 people of


And they are just as adorable now as they were back then! Congrats to both!!
Kicked out where? 
That hat is spectacular, I want one! 
I can‚Äôt imagine the amount of courage and love required to do this back in those days. I wish I had even a fraction of what these two have to stand up for that in which I believe.

Absolutely incredible. I love this. Cheers.

Now that is a lovely couple.  
Is that a double-breasted suit or is it really baggy?  Don't get me wrong, I like baggy, have never been a fan of clothes that hug the form too closely.
Old couples are so cute
What a beautiful couple! Their outfits in the older photo are amazing.  
Good for them for sticking up for love. I'm sure Mary enjoys her husband's company more than the people who kicked her out. It's their loss anyway. She looks like a fun person to be around. 
Jake is a good looking dude
