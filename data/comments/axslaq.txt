My reaction when I finally figure out the Tupperware drawers lids and containers 
Did that child just whip? I respect it
I love how calm she is working it all out, thought she might get frustrated with the red but she keeps working and figuring it out. Hoping to channel that at work tomorrow to figure our this problem I've been stuck on for days.
Way to go little kid! That’s such a fun age to see them figure stuff out
That was absolutely adorable. I was rooting for her the whole time. 
That was a sorting algorithm in O(aww) time!
Learning that delayed gratification skill early <3
[At least hers are stackable.](https://i.imgur.com/7CQd4.gif)
Lol amazing to see the entire thought process unfold 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼😁😁
i thought she was flipping off the camera at the end 
Does it bug anyone else that the cups don't stack in 🌈 rainbow order? Regardless, so cute!
That rug really ties the room together. 
Omg she whipped it! So precious 
[deleted]
My reaction when I finally parallel park without hitting the curb or a car. 
love kid happiness. It's so genuine
Proof that playtime is important!
That little girl is gonna be just fine!
She looks just like Vanellope.
Man I have been trying so hard to get my soon to be 2 year old to not be pissed on frustration things like that would be to her. Any tips?
It's like watching a real life bubble sorting algorithm lol
when she figured out the red was too big and knew where to put it in the middle I had a grin on my face 
"Clever Girl"
Children overcoming challenges needs to be it’s own subreddit.  I already have one or I’d start it.
Man you have to love that celebration dance too cute
That's not even my kid and I'm so proud of her.
why is the correct order not in rainbow order
Watching how people's problem solving region of their brain in action is fascinating, especially at a young age. From narrowing down the possibilities to the celebration because of success, it's great to have these types of toys to develop toddlers.
That’s actually really impressive for a girl of her age. Congrats!
Very smart kid👏🏾

I like that she kept going and didn’t get discouraged. Good habits to develop early!
Those buckets could've been color coded by the colors in the rainbow, teaching another lesson
Me when I beat the Nameless King 
That was like watching a chimp solve a puzzle. 
I was rooting for her so hard.
We're going to need a follow up video of her crushing the SATs 16 years from now.
That little girl has better moves than me.
That’s how I react when i hit “run” python code and it comes back with no errors. 
She looks like Boo!
Twelve years from now:

"Shut up, mom, gawd you're clueless!
Her brain: Indescribably busy
May we always celebrate our victories just like this little boss!
My cousin has those same cup toys, and I had something similar that I would always play with in the bath, except instead of doing this with my cousin I would flip them upside down and build a tower, and she would make it her mission to destroy it😄
At 0:45 she's like: "okay I'm done"
FUCK YEAH YOU DID IT

I think it literally took her N\^2 operations to get there, but I still think that's probably good for her age, most of them would probably have had to retry combinations.
"YESS!!!!   WHO'S GOT THEIR BOWLS IN ORDER?  THIS BITCH!!!!"
Which Fortnite dance is that?
hahah thats nice
Literally me everyday at work. When I finally get everything in order, it's time to go home and I have the same reaction.
I seriously waited to make sure she got it right
I thought I was looking at [Boo from Monsters Inc](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/83/0b/de/830bde602fbe82e3a9c80c9ecf0f953a.jpg)
This is probably one of the few things that make me think if I should really get a vasectomy or not, I love to see this kind of reactions but at the same time I feel like I don't want to have kids... Its been like this for two years 
Stupid kid.  I figured it out in 43 seconds.
Aww I don't know her but I'm sooooo proud ahah
I could have done it faster.
Haha The feeling of achievement, then not knowing what to do with your life after completing it. 
That was adorbs
I don’t know what it is but bangs on little girls are just the cutest thing! 
What an idiot I could have done that way faster 
an otter can do this in 2 seconds. this kid is much, much dumber than an otter
Machine learning.
Actual footage of me trying to find the right socket size
She's like reddit trying to figure out if the Up-vote button is orange or red.
I just realized I'm like a toddler figuring things out  when I'm drunk. 
Pfft. I can do that.
Her focus and concentration is something I can only hope to conjure maybe once a week 
Hell yeah kiddo!
Nawww that was awesome!!!
Oh, bless her little heart!
Was that a bubble sort? 
Guess and check. Engineering at it's finest. 
Anna Kendrick is shook.
Well, this is certainly the *cutest* sorting algorithm I’ve ever seen.
Her shirt says it all “so cute”!!!! 💜
I cannot confirm that I have ever been that happy. 
I really hope she becomes an award winning Olympian 
She worked hard for that win!! Awesome job
me finishing the Plant 42 puzzle in Resident Evil 2 Remake after 2 hours
I’m a 23 yo man and that red one had me fucked up there for a second, good job kid 
It was an emotional rollercoaster ride throughout. 
I love how abruptly she stops cheering and goes back to zen mode.
Did she just whip
Aw, this just melts my heart
Reasons to be sober
What a cute and smart kid, also her eyelashes are so pretty.
That’s some serious focus...Possibky more than I am capable of at my age...😅😅
Did she just whip it? 
She unknowingly just hit the smoothest whip when she solve it.
She learned by doing! 
Best HAPPY DANCE ever!!!
Fixing code in production be like :) 
/r/oddlysatisfying 

Or I guess /r/oddlysatotsfying
She will be a programmer in the future
When did Vanillope get out of the internet?
Dammit now i wanna have kids
I love “kid being proud” videos. They are so pure and heartwarming. I have a small son and love watching him figure things out for the first time. 
This is the type of stuff kids need! Not iPads
Is no one noticing the black eye?
Right at the end:

...now what?
She looks like the girl from wreck it Ralph
When I enter the rediculous wifi password on the first try.
I miss having a moment like this in my life.
I love watching tiny humans figure out life. It’s amazing
You the boss little lady
Pretty much sums up my sorting method on programming. 
Best part was placement of the red cup. Shows she actually gets it
She just motivated the hell out of me. 
Ahhh my heart!! 😩😩
The Babysort Algorithm
After watching this, I’m going to sleep, because everything else on the Internet is horrible. 
I love a tiny inefficient sorting algorithm. My son loved these as well at that age.
i clapped 
Holy crap she is so freakin' cute!
No. Just no.

Why is this here?
Little Vanellope von Schweetz!
One day she’s gonna be in college/university she gonna graduate something she’s really passionate about and her mum is just gonna be there - doing the finger pointers with her 🤩😭
...this kid just figured out a sorting algorithm.

I feel like im watching the start of a movie about a genius kid, and i dont know whether she'll end up inventing the first sapient AI, or conquer Europe.
 How did she get this black eye ? And her reaction at the very end felt like she was really sad right after being joyful
I know the pieces fit!
Still better than that guy on the airplane who couldn’t fit his suitcase in the upper luggage rack. 
🎉✨ Very important to complete a challenging task at this developmental stage in her life. Encourage this as much as possible at this young age. It will follow through into adulthood. ✨🎉
You go girl
Wow parents are starting their kids competitive cup stacking future at an early age these days.
so cute\~
Almost had it there kiddo... oop... there you go! <3
Tupperware is life
Actually this is a great execies for toddlers...
She's a little smarty pants! 🤓💕
That's it? I could have easily stacked them in a minute without even trying my hardest at all. 
Take my upvote!!
So sweet!! 😭 and that’s a cool rug
This is too adorable; it makes me miss my little cousins.
My kids were so cute at that age 
Adorable 
Holy shit that was adorable
Too cute! 
Great. Now I want to have a kid. 
This is why I want kids
Yay!!
That was so unexpectedly squealy
We all strive for these moments, but seeing this makes me went to relive some moments 
Patience of Job this one.
She has a Mac reaction!
I bet I could stack those almost as fast!
That kid is a future r/Perfectfit subscriber!
Aaaww, my heart is melting. She's such a sweetheart. :)
Her reaction is cute.  The colors being in that size-order is r/mildlyinfuriating 
This is how sorting algorithms work. 
Aww..never been so happy for someone.
:( I want a kid
Why does this adorable tiny human have the beautiful eyelashes I’ve always wanted. Unfair. 
Winner winner, chicken dinner 🥘 
This gave me anxiety
Not exactly record time there, short bus
This is the greatest thing I've seen in the entire 23 years I've been on this planet. 
She stacks dishes better than any server i’ve ever worked with too
What a dumb shit.
This is adorable. I’m glad that they let her figure it out on her own. 
I feel like I go through that when I play the witness
Awww man, that was truly adorable lol. 
That was genuinely adorable. 
She did it.
This is just so adorable, and the best is how she's overwhelmed with joy and has to run and hug her Mom!
Beyond precious. Keep at it sweetheart!
When you try 8 different passwords and finally get the right one
Watch me whip
She's Poppin off, she's Poppin off!
When you get the Saran Wrap just right 
O(n\^2)
Absolutely adorable.
When you find the other sock a week later
This has just made my day.
Young Liz Lemon.
Persian rug?
Me when I manage to woke up before 12 every day. 
I'll pay her to come arrange random plastic containers from the store and Chinese places. Can't ever keep that stuff organized and I usually just give up and toss in the trash
NUMBER 1 BABY ☝
[They should have a race!](https://youtu.be/wavh47RpLz4?t=30s)
Good job Vanellope!
Is that Snooki’s daughter? So precious
[All I heard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JElywbkSbY)
Keep those victory’s coming! Good job kid!
I too remember my first sorting "algorithm".
Did I just see a Watch Me Whip at the end???
Did she 'whip' at the end?
That determination was too cute. Loved the end. Super adorable kiddo 
 Celebrate every win!!!
Ahhahaha yayy congratz sweet birthday baby 
She made order out of chaos!
That was the cutest victory!! 
Great parents. Celebrating her accomplishments, and she has a great work ethic, Shes gonna go far
I know how you feel, kid.
Now how do I get my 2 year old to focus on anything long enough to do anything remotely like this?
I wish this was ROYGBIV.  It’s so cute but someone had to fuck it up because they don’t rainbow.
When you get the puzzle just right.
Can someone please make her end reaction into a gif??
That is beyond adorable omg
This kid might be smarter than me. 
😭😭😭💗💗💗
Smart af. :)
Fake, she didn’t do a Fortnite dance 
That's what it feels like to be a scientist
This girl reminds me so much of Vallenope from Wreck it Ralph!! So cute and determined 💗 😭
I wish I got 2% of this sense of achievement from my job. 
It reminds me of those tests they do on monkeys. It really makes you think about how smart humans naturally are, compared to animals. (Not calling her a monkey btw)
So cute! Loving her determination to get it all figured out.
Kids got a future. Stayed calm, worked out the solutions in small steps, and embraced thd final success. Love it.
I was on the edge of my seat the whole damn time. Well done lil lady. 
What an adorably ambitious little poo :’) 
Did she fuckin whip tho 
Better problem solving skills than most adults I know
I was rooting for you kid
R/mildlyinfurating and r/aww at the same time 
Little miss smarty pants
I have this same set. Both of my daughters used it so much when they were little (they’re 13 &  16 now) that I wanted to save it forever. Then we got an African Gray parrot. For the first year, this was his favorite toy. He got quite good at it until he lost interest. I’ll still save it forever because it was so loved. ❤️
Lol that must be a world record because she did it faster than I would've.
Me when I finally get up in the morning.
Worth the wait!
Wow she broke it down with style! Such a cute dance. 
How old is she? ❣️


And what is this game called?
Darn... i thout it was gonna be ROYGBIV
I was having a really bad day, thank you random persons baby for making me smile
This... Does put a smile on my face
who else thought she was giving the finger to the camera for a sec lul

r/programmerhumor bubblesort
this is so cute, also it made me realize I had cups just like that as a kid 👀
I really like the sound made by the cups when they are clashing
I love this so much. Her problem-solving and perseverance are legit. Get this girl into STEM. 
Holy shit this little girl is adorable. Her little stance right at the end of the video lol so cute.
Wooooow 
Yeah baby!
Wow this lil girl is so calm and composed and her attention span is awesome.
Lol
Shit, kid probably got it faster than I would have
Being innocent is adorable and I miss that. 
This is every fresh face in the military when they complete the simplest task.
I probably bought 6 sets of stacking cups. My kid never once attempted to stack them. This was fascinating to watch a toddler see something through. 
Logic! The pure joy of reasoning!
like brute forcing/trying every single inventory item you have in an adventure game.
Yes, she will be able to fit her luggage correctly into the airline’s overhead bin in her future, Yay!
I'm not going to lie those would have fustrated me as a adult
Omg so adorbs 
I wish us humans never lost the ability of being so excited about small shit like this!
Made me day!
Great example of insertion sort
So cute 
Dawwwwwwww this shits cute 
This is considered a self correcting toy, and is designed for a child to explore and “discover” the only solution available. When choices are limited (aka there are not 3629 other flashy toys nearby), they take the time to work out this process and learn grit and self confidence. This is a perfect example of the value of simplicity and “boredom”. 
Piaget is SHOOK 
My reaction when I final defeat ornstein and smough
Toddler sort, O(maybe), space complexity of an entire living room
I love it so much
Well shes gonna be a doctor...
That kid is cute as shit
cute but the has to be the most high pitched voice ever lol
Love the resilience.
One of the best parts of being a parent is seeing different parts of your child's brain come online as time goes on.
Basically me when I fix someone else' code.
I can beat that slow ass time.
I'm pretty sure I can tell I like her parents just by that victory celebration.
For a moment I thought she was going to bust into a Fortnite dance.
\+1 For accurate sweater.
That's awesome
The way she worked that out and stuck to it is a sign of genius . This kid is going places 
The way this kid goes from totally pumped to standing completely still cracks me up. 
Future computer programmer
That was really frustrating to watch. I don't think I should have kids.
She was working like very basic computer algorithm; trial and error.
Good job!
I have drawer that I have to figure out like that every time I’m done with the dishes. 
Aww her reaction is priceless 🙂
Mary from Monster Inc =3
Reminds me of that girl from wreck it Ralph
🤩cutest video I have ever watched🤩
Omg I love her victory dance😍😎
I have no thoughts reddit
...where can I buy this?
She sounds like those plants from Harry Potter 
These stacking cups and similar toys like the stacking rings or simple puzzles are SO FREAKING GOOD for babies and toddlers cognitive development!!!
She’ll be very good at Dark Souls.
My reaction when I finally find a matching lid for my cup at a convenient store!
Why I’m on reddit. 
That Rug is Awesome!!!
My reaction when I finally find the errant ; when debugging a thicc C++ file.
Such a badass! 
♥️♥️♥️
Beautiful 
Science’ing
This was so beautiful, the smile on my face was bigger than hers.
Lowkey lil Susie whipped that naenae. 
Its fascinating to see the developing brain figure things out. 
She’s going to do great in life!! So focused!! 
Whoa smart baby!!
MIT wants to enroll her this coming fall.
Awwww - Her first implementation of quicksort
"Yes, I can do anything I set my mind to!"
Damnit now I want to have more kids, just great thank alot.
Very cute! Bummer about the black eye
This was just the smile I needed
r/asmr
This melts my heart, I have a niece around the same age and they look similar, I would do anything for her :)
Literally me trying to figure out homework 
Her vs iPad mid who doesn't know what real life is.
What sorting algorithm is this?
That’s how I feel when I guess the right answer on a test. 
r/oddlysatisfying

It was like watching a computer program that could only figure out the order by using 1v1 comparisons
Bogo sort be like
😂😂
*whips furiously*
I was cheering her on and giving directions the whole time. Glad she ignored me and figured it out on her own! :)
That's exactly what I do.
This is the only thing to make me smile tonight!
/r/showingmykidsoffontheinternet

Joy in the absolute truest form. I hope she maintains this smile forever. 
Shapes and sizes! Fuck yeah!
Why is not a freaking rainbow? I hate it
Future speed stacking champion
So much better than sitting an iPad in front of her. 
I love this. 
This brings me so much JOY
So cute!
This was so fucking cute lol that little dance was awesome haha 
"Celebration.exe has crashed."
Awww... her concentration tho
What a clever, patient, cutie pie. 
watching kids learn is so interesting to me. i can’t wait to have kids of my own and witness stuff like this everyday
Toddler sort needs to be a thing
Ah the classic insertion sort
She is adorable. And her resemblance to the 'glitch' or Vanellope von Schweetz from Wreck it Ralph is uncanny. - I bet she would love that movie =)

Thank you for sharing!
Oh My Goodness.  So sweet.  Thank you for sharing!
Awwwwww!! She's so proud! :D
The cutest!
Her focus and patience are incredible, congrats to the parents/family!  
This baby is extra beautiful, stunning, smart and oh so very special.  All of us should feel this good about ourselves!

Clever girl, thought that through
Her shirt is accurate lol
...and that's why we triumphed over all other species.
frigan adorable and she is a little warrior toddler with her black eye lol. Always sucks when it happens to our little ones but there is nothing to stop it and many more will happen lol.
Thank you little Angel to remind me that we should enjoy & celebrate our smallest victories 🎉🤘
Well that was adorable
Oh my goodness. She is so adorable!
Future puzzler!!
That is incredible! Thanks for sharing 
My cat heard her squealing and came in the room to see what the commotion was.
Shes smarter than some of my coworkers 
Maximum tries
I could do that
Imagine how she'll react when she opens her first clam-shell packaging
Damn she acting like she unraveled the universe. So cute 😘
OMG shes so cute. I swear she yells "Lets go!!!!1"

ah, a visual representation of a bubble sort 
That kid is way more patient than I am. 
Now that's what I call a sorting algorithm!
By the nine, she hit the whip
I thought she was flipping up the double birdie too haha
Haha aw, she sounds like a mandrake being depotted. 
I thought she was giving the finger after finishing this. 
10/10. Would nibble her nose.
Well God damn, that's adorable
I find stuff like this fascinating. Like for an adult that's obviously a simple task but from the broader perspective of the whole animal kingdom that's really a remarkable level of intelligence a child at an age that we'd largely consider to not know much of anything.
Ah yes. Baby sort. If I'm not mistaken it's an O(sin(^n √log(n)) * n * cos(n)) algorithm. Very effecient.
Source pleeeease? I need more of her cuteness in my life! 🤗
The way she hugged her mommy. Awwww 🥰 
0:20 Girl, you JUST had the yellow cup in the red cup. The red cup isn't gonna fit in the yellow cup!

&#x200B;

On another note, YAAY! YOU DID IT!
I love how you can clearly tell when "CelebrationMode.exe" was closed lmao...
What's she so proud about? I could do that in nearly half that time.
I thought she flipped off the camera at first lol
Watch me whip... Watch me nae nae
Analytical little approach too. She is one to watch. She will bust through all your locks and gates. 
Is this the girl from Wreck it Ralph
Callmart time flies like an arrow,

Learn to enjoy every minute of your life
I expected dabbing
Eyyyyyy she got it!!! And AWE, praising the mommy!!!
What a cutie!!
Her shirt says it all!
Super wholesome watching a newb git gud.
lol the glory and happiness fleeted quickly
As my SIL would say, “ohmygodIloveher!!!”
The fact that she put in the effort to see in through until the end without getting even a tiny bit frustrated should be praised thoroughly and often. THIS is what separates people who can do things from people who can do ANYTHING!
That’s me at work everyday, except nobody cares when I figure it out
I normally don't like kids but this was cute as hell. 
Well done kid!
Me trying to fit 5 days of dishes into a tiny dishwasher 
The noise that the cups make while stacking is really satisfying...
she’s soooooo cuteeeeee😍😍😍😍
Me after an escape room
Saw it without the volume first, and it sounded exactly like I imagined.  Cutest thing ever.  I'm getting these for my niece.
She almost independently invented the whip and nae nae
So stinkin sweet. You can actually see her thought process and the process of deduction. 
At the very end: "OK, now what?"
My dogs just lost their shit
Thr most wholesome thing I've seen all day.
First time every time!
I hate kids, but that was adorable.
My reaction when the IT guy resets my password after I locked myself out.
This dance will be in the Fornite shop next week.  Calling it now.
OMG, I know that face. When my kids were that age they would have that cute as fuck concentration face when they were really focussed on something. Adorable. 
Is this me lol. My parents own a really similar rug and growing up had really similar furniture. This looks exactly like my childhood home

HA! My rabbit can do that...... Better
Oh look a kid interacting with the back of a phone
Ha. Nice try cuteness. Still not having kids.
Sadly I know adults who probably couldn't do it as well as she did...that's one smart kid
Too cute
**Achievement Unlocked:** *Intelligence level equal to a sea otter!*
Insertion sort animation done the right way.
i remember my first sorting algorithm like it was yesterday 
So clever :)
Reminds me of Mac opening unibot.
And that is why I teach. Doesn't matter the age or subject. That joy of getting it is what keeps me going.
Lol stupid little girl I can solve that thrice as fast and I’m probably more than thrice her age, why tf she even here
R/noyesyesnoyesnononoyesyesYESSSS
Oh my gosh. She looks exactly like a little girl I used to teach. You're not meant to have favourites, but she absolutely was my favourite!
Ooooooh!!! This is the cutest! What a sweet little accomplishment aww
Superrrr cute omg 😍♥️
It was really fun watching her figure the sizes out! Good job, little one!
Awesome...
That kid is super awesome! I would write my initial reaction, but there was a curse word in there.
This shit made me smile and I've had a really bad time crying all night. Thank you.
Smart cookie!

That’s how it feels to finish a writing project! 
Its like a bubble sort but random
I also have a hard time with that puzzle
u/vreddit_bot
USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA!
I thought there's gonna be a dab tho
Pssh.  Whatever.  I bet I could get it in like 5 seconds.
AOC when she won her seat.
so cute, she deserves a cookie
Adorable. At the end when she drops her arms: "Now wtf do i do with my life?"
Yeah kid! Smashed it!
I expected her to fortnite dance..
Okay this creeps me out. I just get the impression that she knew she was expected to react that way for the camera. What are we doing to ourselves?
Thought she was pulling out the bird for a second there
That's my reaction everytime I complete a level in Portal. 
She has a better touchdown dance than most football players. 
She beat my personal best...
She sounds like the baby from Super Monkey Ball 😂😂
This kids brain is literally operating in a sorting algorithm and it's really cool to see. 
I hope someone in the NFL sees this and uses it for a TD celebration!
With her hair style, she reminds me of Penelope from Wreck-It Ralph.

it's also interesting to watch the gears turning her head
Oh my god so cute.  
She looks like the girl from Despicable Me.
Well actually the thing that makes me the happiest is that she didn't dab
Literally my reaction when GOT S8 trailer dropped yesterday
How old is she? 
toddlerSort the hottest new sorting algorithm
Two days later: She has thoroughly figured out the cups and is boooooooored!
Yes! In your FACE mom!!
That screech tho... 
That reaction was so cool. When your kid reacts after an accomplishment it just makes you melt man. 
Am I the only one seeing a toddler version of Vanellope from Wreck It Ralph? 
Big deal I could probably do this too. Maybe. 
That folks, is the rationality of a being with a mind that is modeled after God's
Those are some of the longest and prettiest real eyelashes I have ever seen
I love her lil squeaky voice. So sweet and smart! 
Did she do pull a whip and nae nae on is!?
Hmm. Interesting sorting method. Could you send me the code? I'd love to check it out.
I was also cheering for her!
Someone needs to add some victory music to this as soon as she starts celebrating.
Nice carpet too!  Looks like legit handmade Central-Asian/Persian or something.  I don't recognize the pattern as being a specific type, but I am merely an amateur collector and enthusiast.
I’m in tears kids are so great 
Yeah ima take like 5
I was a bit curious about the sorting algorithm she used:

1) BRG P Y O  
2) BRP G Y O  
3) BRPG Y O  
4) BRPY G O  
5) BRY P G O  
6) BRYP G O  
7) BRYPG O  
8) BRYO PG  
9) BO RY PG  
10) BOY R PG  
11) BOYR PG  
12) BR OY PG  
13) BROY PG  
14) BROYPG  

It's very close to a straight insertion sort but she doesn't fully reassemble the tower in the interim steps and is forced to switch to a merge sort near the end.
Big O of this sorting algorithm?
Whatever, I could have done it faster.
More competent than most adults I know.
Hahaha did she whip it then? 😂😍
So cute 😁
I have three 20-somethings currently living in my home and not a one of them has mastered this. Stacking plates, bowls, pots and pans, measuring cups,...all a complete mystery to them.
I love how she doesn't get mad or give up. So adorable. 
Me irl. But y’all ain’t giving me 70k upvotes😔😔😔😔
i've never seen a child so calmly place those cups together O.o
Little humans are so adorable.
Such long eyelashes. 
Love that she instantly hugs! Cute reaction. 
That little Zooey Deschanel :')
That's so cute! I miss mine being that little.
So cute!!!!!
That's a nice Turkish carpet  
Why are they in that order *tendy noise*
Priceless 
This kid is better at sorting out containers than I've ever been at sorting out my priorities
She had some serious dedication there. You go girl!
She did it faster then i could've 
Wow so cute and smart 🤗
Pfft, I was able to do this in half the time and I only needed help once.
Now you're thinkin with portals, kid.
Lol can’t even stack. Get good. 
smart child! 
I feel like if I ever had a daughter, she would look a lot like this and now my heart and my ovaries are bursting ❤️ what a precious girl.
Shit!! she gained 8 creativity points, keep on going and she might max out the creative skills
Wow this makes me want to be dad right now!!!! 
Reminds me ofVvanellope from Wreck It Ralph. So cute! 💕
Damn why is that oddly satifying 
I have the same reaction whenever I beat a boss in a Souls game.

Me when CSS finally works, with cursing removed.
So proud!
And we see a future Amy Santiago in dance after solving a puzzle
I think I know this kid? OP, are you Walter?
Did she whip in the beginning of her celebration?
Me too, kid, me too.
Enjoy it while you can, kid. It's all downhill from here. 
Her reaction is priceless. Specially the hug out of joy. 
I like how she immediately cools down and seemingly emotionally moved on right after she was down celebrating.

"YEEEAAAH! *shoulder flop* Never have to do YOU again"
My son is 5 months old now and I can't wait to see him do stuff like this. She's SO HAPPY!! 
Did she just hit us with that whip. 
Hey
Oh zigga my dah that child is a adorable bean!
The cutest Bubble sort
bogo sort in action
Made my day 
She should be an eyelash model.
What a nice temperament that little gal has. No frustration; just perseverance. :)
She's like: "HELL YEAH! I DONE IT! ITS OVER! 22 HOURS TO FEEL THIS ACCOMPLISHMENT!... now... what next?
CUTEST!!!!!
I coulda done it way quicker.
My reaction when I am done with the Ikea furniture.
clever girl
She reacts like Mac in Always Sunny with karate chops to the air
aww! So adorable.
So cute
Someone please give this girl a mic so she can drop it.
These are the games toddlers need to be playing. Not iPads. (Yes I know iPadshave development games but these are much better for them.) So cute.

She is SO SWEET.  
Now watch me whip whip
Endzone dance
She’s gonna turn out to be a super genius or something with that level of patience and understanding at that age!
Pfft, I could've solved that in 10 seconds. 
One promising kid right there. Eliminating the options quickly just like that.
She’s a legend! I can’t believe she stuck with it, clever little lady!
I thought i was on r/perfectfit
Respectfully, she won gold at the Olympics of plastic cup organisation. But her face after it is what every athlete goes through...what's next & disappointment. Xx
Bubble sort 
WAY too cute!
Really smart kid
Wow. That's pure happiness. Makes me happy. 
Super smart girl.
I'm actually super impressed that she completed it, and so calmly as well. It's actually very very though for a kid her age.
Yaassss

Finally done!
+5 Problem-Solving

"Haha fuck you mom i did it!"

She got the sorting algorithm figured out.

Bubble sorting 
This is what matters, not a silly college degree!

Figuring out how to solve problems > some report
Thats one tough ass toy 
Such a smart kid :)
That reaction was gold. When I was 4, I used to get happy seeing gel pens.
Sweaty lil bean did a puzzle solving!!!!!
I was expecting Gangnam style at the end for some reason. 😂😂
Damn at the end I thought she was flipping the adult off
The simple problem solving is just mesmerizing to watch. Maybe it's just because most kids (or adults) have the attention span to just to sit down and figure out a problem.  
Its amazing to see how logic develops in humans.
The invention of bubble sort

I can see this kid holding the WR for quickest Rubik's Cube solve in a few years time.
She's got mannerisms that she hasn't even had a chance to see and already executing them perfectly. Flawless.
As a programmer, this is insanely impressive. How do our brains do this?!?!
