That's a win, but I think this might be a Kestrel.

Reminds me of the chicken hawk from the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons.
Do a kickflip
Fun fact: Falcons (like this kestrel) are more closely related to parrots than hawks!
What if the bird's name is Tony?
Cute lil eyas.

Google does not recognize Tony Hawk.
Tony Hawk got nuthin' on Tiny Hawk.
Thats a falcon but none the less still cute.
Trying to make sure you know what he looks like in case you ever run into him?
We should petition this guy to be in the first Skatbirb dlc.
I bet he still gets sick air though.
Someone should create a social media account and go on telling stories about how various birds approach 'Tiny Hawk' and ask it if it can do a barrel roll or something.
Do a kick flip!

That bird needs photoshopped onto a skateboard.
But he's so much better looking than Tony, and better for the environment too. How many mice has Tony eaten?

Not like it matters, people nowadays, even his own fans wouldn't recognize him even if he said he was Tony Hawk.

We all know tiny hawk has the 900 on deck
I am not disappointed

The irony is that this is a kestrel, so technically a falcon, not a hawk, though they are still raptors and not that distantly related.
I'm sure the actual story of this photo is way better than whatever the title is
Ok, but now I can only imagine that Tony Hawk referred to at least one of his kids with the pet name ‚Äútiny hawk‚Äù as it is too adorable to not be done.
Is this a flex?
