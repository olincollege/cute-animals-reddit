I took in a [little stray](https://i.imgur.com/lUNq9pn.png) that does something like this... he comes up, reaches out and boops you on the lips ever so gently for attention.

Obviously it works every time.
He loves you. You are blessed.
He went ….maehhh

What a beautiful way to enjoy life
That little meow following the kiss is just the icing on the sweet little cake. Thank you for this!
I miss my cat. Fucker would do this all the time and then shred my leg after I put him down.
We’re all melting. That little meow at the kiss is cherry on the melting cake.
I can do the same with my rag doll, it’s fantastic. I always roll the dice and stick my face in his belly and it’s even more fantastic.
This is prime r/catsmirin if I've ever seen one
OMG what a sweet gesture to very sweet cat.
What a sweet bundle of fluff. 🙂
You obviously take amazing care of him.
That's beautiful. But there was a moment, just the tiniest split second, where he considered killing you. But he decided against it...for today...
My heart just melted too. Please also xpost to r/MenSmittenWithKittens!
Gorgeous stunning kitteh!
They say cats are selfish assholes... And they are not entirely wrong. But, the affectionate ones will really melt your heart.
[This guy continues to lie and cheat his way](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/r3d0wr/growing_up_muslim_i_used_to_get_my_ass_kicked_for/hma2rjr/) to continued karma for... some reason?

You sure this is your cat? Not your girlfriend's cat? Or was she your sister? Can't keep your story straight and neither can you.
Is this person paying for views? I keep seeing his posts on all different subs at the top of my front page? Why this person?
I love the "mrah" at the end from him.
You have been blessed with the paw of love.
Spoiled rotten...is not a bad thing! Love the love!
What a beauty!
“Mrrraaahr”
Hey it's not healthy to seek so much validation online, just thought you should know
Oh god, it's the guy with the cat.. *again*
You look like you have very good skin. The cat is wondering what your routine, is all.
That guy has the sweetest smile.  No wonder the cat likes him!
Thats so cute
I love this!!!
That’s how it is with my puppy in the mornings. It’s now a ritual where we play together as soon as I wake up. I swear, his favorite words are “good morning” lol.
Man people on Reddit have some serious emotional issues
So sweet!
Such a beautiful cat
Precious baby!!!! You two are so cute♡
This is my morning as well with my little tortie
Awww. You have earned the love of a cat!
That man has beautiful skin.
Oh my gosh both of you are gorgeous!
That cat has nothing but adoration for its owner
That little meow at the end was precious
That little meow 🥺
Cats are very emotional beings.
I love your kitty’s comment at the end.
You his beeotch
Yo that cat is FUCKING ADORABLE.
Whenever my cat stretches and im near him he extends the stretch until his cute tiny paws touch me.  If it's my hands I close them around his paw gently to reciprocate and if it's another part of my body I adjust so that he can lean on it if he wants and usually end up petting him. It's the cutest!!!!

One of those little life gifts that are everything

Edit: although in the morning.  He finds my rib cage and stomps on it.  Good morning 3 am and then again at 6:30
Too cute, and that cat is GORGEOUS
He's cute, and so are you.
Awww, that's so sweet🧁n cute🥰
That's so sweet, i'mma cry. 😭 what a sweet boy you have!!
I love the cranky little meow.  🤣
Just have everyone on the planet watch this and it will bring about world peace.  :)
My heart just melted a bit.
We're all melting
Guys with pets make my ovaries explode.
Faris, you are a really good looking human.
I just lost my first ever cat today. She was only 2 years old but had a lot of medical problems. I’m hurting so bad and many people in my life don’t seem to understand. Watching this brought some bittersweet memories
That was the manliest "maow " haha
Your kitty sure loves you!!!
Can we just talk about how genuinely happy this person looks when they are holding their cat, absolutely precious
He looks like my cat that passed away last year. He was so beautiful and wanted attention, but not too much. I miss him so much
This is sooo cutttttteeee!
Cutest ever. Made my morning
What a beauty!
Kitty love is the best love 🥰
Well that’s fucking adorable
Ragdolls Man, they’re something else! How stinkin’ adorable are you guys?!? The audible “Meh” protest at the head kiss was perfect! LOL Mine is like my shadow. ❤️ love him as much as if I’d birthed him.

You and your cat are adorable.
sir there is a cloud in your arms 🥺
If I block this clown, would reddit stop showing me his attention seeking videos and pictures?
His name is Marley and he is a ragdoll cat. He is 10 years old anf quiet clingy in the most loving way.

My Instagram is one_night_in_faris

If anyone wants to stalk me. It’s public so you don’t need an account to look at it.
That's a beautiful kitty
Maaaan this is why my wife thinks I need a cat lol. Cute!
You have been knighted as a friend of cat everywhere.
We had to put down our ragdoll kitty for FIP last June. I'm still so torn up about it, but there was no way he could recover from his illness. They're the sweetest cats. I miss his blue eyes in the morning, as well.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
You are both lovely ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
![gif](giphy|l0HlGfnQY9XvE4jVC)
Did you have your make up done in a pic before?  Was that you?
You 2 are so cute!
You've been blessed
You are both  lovely.
You’re both adorable!
I guess it's settled. Cats > dogs
😻😻😻😻
Gorgeous kitty 😻
*melts away*
Awww the way he looks at you!!!!! 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
i want someone to look at me the way this cat looks at you 😭
You are both so sweet.
This guy had a serious crush on his cat - Agent J
Bro your crying because a cat touched you. Get your shit together
Awww, he wubbb wooo 😍
That gentle face touch is so cute.
Awwww How pure & beautiful love
This took my heart.
Hahah aww I'm melting too. Such a little fluff!
I melt when my cat pats my face.
I got some major second hand happiness from watching this, thank you!
I've got one just like that. Whines until I pick him up then chills out lol. Good kitty.
When i hold my cat Lucy like that she stretches her legs up in the air. She's adorable!
Also, she hates being picked up, but as soon as she's in my arms she starts purring.
The kitten is so cute.
That little quack at the end 😭
He looks like a little cloud he is so adorable
Nothing beats a face-pat from a fuzzy paw.  And that is one super fuzzy paw!

Very sweet - thanks for sharing!
Oh my gawd how lovely.
I could see a tear of happiness ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sleep) and that lil hihi at the end . May your furry friend live as long as possible.
That’s the cats way of saying, “I could do it, I could rip your throat out, but I won’t cuz I love you.”
Just watching this makes me so happy :)
That's what kitteh was campaigning for all along
Nothing better than a smooth paw on the face.
what type of kitty?
One of our cats pets me too.
You're his *world* man.
Yo this guy looks like the Persian Emperor from 300
MEOW WAKE UP
 Very sweet
I touch da face
THIS IS SO CUTE I WANT TO PUNCH A BRICK WALL!!!
My boy does this when laying down to sleep with me. He will reach out and put his paw on my cheek. He just wants to hold my face while he falls asleep. It tickles but I absolutely love it.
We call those floofy feet snow shoes, in my house.
He's perfect.
The Cat, “ this dude’s a mess. The only peace he gets is when he forces me to be picked up.”

“I do this for him.”
Aww
OMGosh how sweet!!  So cute the both of you!!
My male cat does this every time I hold him like that. He'll take one or both of his front paws and touch my face. Glad he's not the only weirdo that does it!
I'm sorry but i speak cat and he was putting his claws to your face as a warning. Then when you kissed him he said, foff in a polite way.
Ha, the happiness in your face 😊
I wish I wasn’t highly allergic to cats
I always thought this was a shut up move.
Wait til he starts doing that more and getting his paws into your mouth. That’s what my cuddle bug has started doing. 

Your cat is really super cute though :).
That little meow after the kiss did it for me

*mrah*
This is so adorable! 🥺 I had to leave my cat at my parents home for college so this really warms my sad heart.
“I bless you with my toe beans humans”
that little grunty meow ❤️
Gorgeous kitty.

One of mine refuses to be a lap cat but will scream at you from the end of the hallway until you come to him.  As soon as you start the petting he melts on the floor and purrs his little heart out.  If you attempt to leave he'll follow you around the house doing rolly- pollies un0til you stop to pet him again.  Then gets more and more cuddly and clingy the more I do it.

I've tried many times to show him its much more comfortable on the chair with me for pets but he's a bit of an asshole so he resists.  Even to the point where I'll call him from the computer room and he'll come up the hallway and give me a look that's says " what's taking you so long", before bolting back down the hallway so you'll follow him lol.
Omg awwwww!!
I melted more ! uffffff beyond adorable![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Omg! I love both of you. Please stay safe.
My cat does this to stop me kissing her sometimes, but that’s adorable that she seemed to want your attention :) mines just a mardy cow
You two are so cute together. Thanks for making my day!
Cats are the fucking best
Hooman I love you okay 🥺

I had a cat that LOVED being carried around like this
He’s so fluffy I could die!

Awww 😍 he really loves you
Floofy beans
Oh my g o d . My heart just melted away. What a lover!
Adorable ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|hug)
Welcome to the club of people who are addicted to animals.  Just lovely.
So precious
You are both adorable!
This is so cute.
Ahh that face when you kissed him!
This is how my cat asks for food
r/mademesmile - you have a really cute/contagious smile!!
Aww he's so cute!!! This makes me want a cat, I've only ever had dogs. I like your avatar too btw OP
He’s beautiful and so affectionate ❤️
Ragdolls for you! They’re just attention whores and it’s amazing!
aahh 😍
You’re both adorable!
I used to hold my cat like that... until she got older, and developed breathing problems, to the point where holding her in that way would make her short of breath, so I stopped doing it. I miss it, but her health is more important. Cherish your kitties, everyone.
Omg, the way those little blue eyes are looking at you is amazing!
That guy is sooo handsome.
my heart..... oh ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|snoo)
On of my cats will scream in the morning and we always thought she just wanted to be fed.  Sometimes she wouldn’t eat and would just keep yelling at us. My girlfriend discovered it’s just because she wanted to be picked up and help every morning. Now we can tell the difference between a regular meow and her “pick me up” meow.
It’s like a human baby! “The gaze” ♥️
Gentle pet for hooman! He/she loves you quite a lot! They chose to give you the soft pads instead of the sharp knives. I hope your little one brings you many more moments relief.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Omg you guys are so cute together! ❤️❤️ my cat loves being picked up too and she trusts my SO and I completely.
It’s the meow at the end for me 😍
I always hold my cat like a baby. I truly believe it makes them better cats.
He's baby
💘😭
One of my ragdolls does this. Anytime he thinks I'm not giving him ALL of my attention when he wants it. *pat face*
Awwww
Too freaking cute!
I can see your heart melt when they boop your chin.
Omg so cute !!
Off topic but the guy skin is so beautiful.
Get someone that stares at you the way that cat stares at him
I love my cat too 🐱 his name is Finn
This is love ❤️
Awww, his little tufted paw!
That kitty loves you! My Spiral does the same thing on occasion:D
Truly an "awwwww!"
This is ridiculously adorable. Aww <3
He looks like a ragdoll kitty, I've always wanted one!
What a sweet lil baby aw, wish my cat would let me snug like this
His face after you kissed him. lol so adorable like little gasp
This is too good ;-;
aw
Gosh that's divine
Genuine love right here
Oh we have one who begs for forehead kisses, she comes and nuzzles her forehead against our faces, and if we make a kissy noise she will present the forehead!
My kitty will lay on my chest and do the same thing, reach out his paw and touch my face. And then I melt into a puddle.
He knew what you needed
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flushed)
I’d do anything for this
You blushed!
If I fits...

/edit Also 'Look at me!', I am the Captain now!
Watching this guy's heart melting in real time is at least as "aww" as the cat XD
Thanks for showing me this love. I needed to see this today.
Love that "Ahhh" from that fluffy cutie!
Love. So gentle!
Okay I need to have this beautiful baby!! How sweet is he!
My cat does this too while I cradle him. I think it's because they learn we touch their faces as a sign of affection. I adore when he does it.
Precious.
“Why are you not looking at *me*, human?”
That's a rag doll cat. Cherish that angel
Is behbeh.
He looks like a little cloud!
Oh precious!! What a beautiful kitty.
My girl died 9 weeks ago and she used to LOVE being held like a baby. She’d put her paws on my face too. God I miss her. Give your kitty a kiss from me.
He loves you so much!!!!
The way he touches your face lmao!
“Your whiskers are not like mine”
So much love. What a great post, thank you.
He’s so dang CUUUTE
This is so adorable 🥺🥺
"Meeeh"
You are both divine, very sweet.
I'm so jealous. I would have no skin left on my face if I tried to do that to my cat.
This melts my heart ♥️ So darling (both of them)
You’re his person…. Dawwewwww
So cute!! Pretty kitty!!
Our big cat won’t let you hold him for 5 seconds before he fights his way out of your arms. The small one yells until you hold her over your shoulder for 20 minutes every morning. She’s a longhair so I have to make sure I get it out of the way before I shower or my beard looks like it has more grey than usual.
r/ntbdbiwdfta
His grouchy meow at the end was adorable
My Siamese does the same thing!!! He has a complete meltdown if you don’t hold him in the morning.
This is everything
Very handsome - both of you!
r/bettereveryloop
As a brotha with a cat myself, teach me your ways. My cat growls and stares into the depths of my soul. I haven't held her long enough to see what happens after 37 seconds.
That's love. Pure love, from both of you.
I can’t tell who is sweeter, you or the cat
Love how that left paw was making biscuits. That is one content cat.
Hell yea dat shit cute
So precious!!
Too cute!!!
Way to bring a smile when someone needs it
boring
Sweetest most precious thing I’ve seen in a sec. This made my day.
Awww is he a ragdoll? So cute! Also men who love cats are the best men :)
My cats always doing that half-hearted bat to my face either when I'm holding her or she's standing next to me. That or she's ramming her head into me. Is that a sign of super affection? I thought it's what all cats do
The chosen one, he love you
I melted too! The look on your sweet cat's face says it all. Honestly, getting feedback from your cat is one of the best feelings ever I think :')
If you hadn’t declawed me I’d be scratching the shit out your face now dude , singed your cat
Wow, the love he has for you (and you for him!) Is so heartwarming! Thank you for sharing this precious moment!
Very brave with those bottles up there
Sweet & Beautiful!
I’m not sue most people realize this but that predator is obviously very aggressive and should have been euthanized. S/ 

I’m also  heartbroken every time a western exotic animal displays cute behavior
Holding a cat makes any man 100% hotter
lol I can see my guys heart melting in real time. Cats have so much power over us it’s adorable.
Aww two cuties
I have a Maine Coone who insists on being held like this, he puts his paw on my cheek and just stares into my eyes sometimes.
Awww He loves his Daddy
That look with the adoring eyes, so sweet
can't stop watching this, he's so cute and fluffy, what breed is he?
You guys have the best relationship!
awwww, your smile just emanated joy!  that's so happy.  Please give your lil furball a scritch from me!
Flip your sweatshirt around, put kitty in the hood, more cuddles all day heheh
This is awesome dam feels
‘Mahw’
You guys were made for each other!
Onions everywhere!!!
I love cats with facial markings like that…it’s like a cartoon when a bomb exploded in their face, so just their face is grey…
He's a very pretty kitty.
Pure love, he loves you
I love his gray face.
Handsome duo!
r/CatsMirin would love this
Love
Mine does that too #love
‘You……you my hooman’
Your duck is very fluffy.
Looks exactly like my cat, is that a ragdoll?
Aw, that's cute. My ragdoll is just the same. Strolls up to me and meows to be picked up and loves to be held just the same way. He loves being rocked gently like a baby as well.
I would die
He loves the beard. Must keep the beard. For him.
Your happiness is heartwarming bro hope everything turns fine for you, always know you're not alone
Man this vid is making me want to cuddle with my cats.
Such a pretty kitty, especially with that little love light in his eyes
so mf cute that’s awesome
You're both super adorable.
Awww. Him loves you!!
Ragdolls are just giant teddy bears
What a cutie
So sweet together!
Thank you for sharing some peace.
So sweet! I love your videos.
This is so precious. I don’t understand how some people don’t like cats. They can actually be so affectionate!
Awesome
Awww. That kitty loves you, man. It's waiting for you to scratch it's belly so it can lightly attack you. With little, rear leg kicks with tiny bites and very little nails.
I Love how respond with little meow after kissing him.
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING LIKE CAT LOVE...
THEY "OWN" YOU !
Ok- you two are the cutest thing I’ve seen all day! Your cat has giant paws and your precious laugh at the end is too much! Thank you for sharing. Sending Love & best wishes in life!!
How’d you get a cloud in your home??
That’s a beautiful cat
OP struggling not to cry tears of joy is the cherry on top
The gentle cheek pat from kitties is so endearing. You have a gorgeous kitty!
OPs face is fucking priceless.
Did that cat just quack like a duck?
Awwwww
Beautiful cat!
one of my cat did that once, she put a lil' bit of claws and was trying to pull my face to her, so I did that and she gave me a "kiss"

I almost cried
Soo sweet❤️❤️❤️❤️ I love when my kitty gives me the paw
r/mensmittenwithkittens
You two are so cute. Oh my god when he touched your face, my heart melted. Clearly he is loved and well cared for and that says a lot about you as a person.
Best video I’ve seen today! Real men love cats! 😻😻😻
Ommgggggg 😍😍😍😍
The unshed years in his eyes afterwards though.
Siamese are incredibly affectionate cats. Mine is a cuddle bug. Loves to be held like a baby. Best cats ever.
What a great cat Dad!!!!
there goes r/aww in the filter
That was some good stuff 😎
what a beautiful cat! that sounds exactly like a ... duck.

Pretti kitti
My little stray we took in does this to me. I know I probably shouldn't let her touch my face so much but it melts my heart every time.
r/catsmirin
“This face, I like it” -the cat, probably
Aww, so cute.  I love his little voice too.
The cat looks so lovely and soft. This cat looks like cream.
Weh
This guy again....
Melt away.  We have one that doesn't want much contact, but when she wants contact it's very nice.  

Also have an outdoor cat that won't leave you alone.  Has to have all the loving.
Karma

Wait till he does it while you’re pooping.
It's confirmed. He absolutely loves you and I see the feeling is 100% mutual.
Soft adorable cloud baby. By the way, your smile is incredibly sweet!
what a lovely boy you have there!!
Animals are more therapeutic than people realize. Especially if you take the time to show them you love them, too. Great job.
Gotta be a lot of dust in here. I'm not crying - <SNIFF!> - you're crying. . .
That is a fine animal.
Kitties of all kinds are one of the greatest gifts to mankind.  We have 4 kitty babies so I should know, hahahaha!  You never know what they're gunna do next.

Cat: "you're a good person"
That little rah at the end... too cute
My boy nox always wants baby time. It's so precious
and then he scratched the hell out of him
💚🐈‍⬛💙
Beautiful!
That little sound at the end…. Ugh so cute!
Aww, so precious! Melted me!
What kind of cat is that?
Ugh I am in love
❤️❤️❤️🥺🥺🥺
That is adorable
Ours wakes me up using her claws ever so carefully against my face. Barely touches me. Still sharp though. Guess I’m her personal pin cushion.
Awie
This is just adorable you can feel dude melting inside 🐈🐈💕💕🐾🐾
My baby does this too! 🐈
Yeah he can see that you're also a beautiful angel person. You two are equally matched.

My cats used to do this too. I miss those little babies. They both died of feline leukemia.
My ragdoll does that too!
He loves you.
Awww is right! That is one SWEET kitty cat! I wish people were more like animals tbh.,
Beautiful boy ❤️
OMG, I was melting too, but the little "Mwah," killed me dead with squeee. 

I used to have a Maine coon type cat who had the biggest, softest, fluffiest paws. When he'd stretch his toes apart, his paw was bigger than my palm. He'd do this paw caress sometimes, but mostly would do it on my hand. He also perfected the Shrek Puss-in-Boots version of the big pupils & softened face to stare up every time he wanted me to pick him up. I miss him so much.
I read that as “died” and I got so sad. Glad to see I read that wrong. He’s so precious
His meow is wonderful. ❤️ Makes me miss my Meezer…
Men that loves cats melt MY heart. 😍😍😍😍 Watching my fiancée cuddle my oldest cat every night is my favorite part of the day. 

You are beautiful. Your catson is beautiful. I hope you have a wonderful day! Thank you for this beautiful video!
Omg that little paw tap. "Love my human!"
Dang I wish I had a cat that would look at me that way. 
Also with those eyes.
Also a cat.
omg i am so envious
That's so sweet.
Awwwww
That touch gave you life. Approximately 2-3 days have been added to your life.
He’s so pretty!!!

The cat isn’t bad either
my heartt
I'm crying this is so sweet ❤️

They way you both look at each other is beautiful

I'm so happy you've found each other ❤️
He loves you so much I’m gonna cry 🥺🥺🥺
I had a guinni piggy that would give kisses- I would tell him” give Mommie a kissie” and he would give me a little smooch/ lick right on the lips. ALL animals respond to love. People found it hard to believe until I showed them. He lived much longer than the usual rodent-
He adores you. This is so cute!
The chosen one
He is BABY
So cute.
Those eyes are so beautiful. That cat loves you!
Him babey ☺️
Mine walks across the room and bites my calf when he wants attention. Barn cats these days...
Yah cats have a way of stealing your heart, right before they pounce on your feet in the middle of the night.
Aww~!!! Sure, you can tell this kitty loves their human but omg does this human love their kitty too! The eyes tearing up with the absolute joy from kitty's loving boop. Soooo relatable <3
I believe you are “it,” my friend! 

For real, that’s so sweet!!!!
Your cat looks so soft :3
If your wondering where his paws are it’s because he has you wrapped right around every single toe.
my eyes tearing up 🥺🥺
love that
Aww!
Haha. He's awesome.
He will always be your baby 🥺
He's checking distance to your throat for easy clawing later. :)
My little boy only cuddles with me when i wake up. We have a pact it seems. He sleeps besides me and allows me to put him on my chest and smother him only when we wake up just for 10 mins.
Oh my what cuteness. Siamese kitties are the most affectionate ☺
What a sweetie!!!
When I was a kid, I had a sweetie who looked just like her.  She was so gorgeous that my 9-year old self gave her the most sophisticated and glamorous name I could come up with.  Chablis.  HA!  Ended up calling her Shabby.  The two of you are beautiful and made me smile.  

Because I love to share knowledge and am known by friends and family to be “aggressively helpful”, I’m going to stick my nose where it doesn’t belong. Just checking to see what is on top of your refrigerator?  If it’s cooking oil, find a new spot.  If it gets warm on top, and is exposed to a lot of light, it could cause the oil to quickly go rancid or take on odd flavors.  Learned this the hard way with the above-stove cabinet and turning on the hood light back when the high-wattage incandescent bulbs threw off a lot of heat which transferred upward.  Wasted a lot of money on fancy oils.  

Again, y’all are charming.  Thanks for sharing!
aww the cats eyes so mesmerizing
The only way I can get my last hour of sleep in the morning is to let my cat sleep on my chest. She'll rest her paw on my chin or my shoulder while she's resting there.
one of my cats would touch my face with his paw when i would hold him like that as well sigh i miss him so much 🥲
I never wanted to be someone else so badly
Whatever you’re dealing with, YOU ARE ONE DAM LUCKY MAN
Mine does “the touch” all the time, then a nose boop.   Love it
He's a baby:)
I think thats a ragdoll, they are super friendly
Did he quack?
Gotta love when you can hold your cat like a baby
I literally said "Aww" out loud.
This is so wonderful. Thank you for sharing.
You're melting? I'm melting watching the two of you! 

Oh my word, that is SO sweet.. Somebody loves you!!!!
It’s the karma farmer again
Awwww!
You and your cat are beautiful
What you have right there is a spoiled cat.
Good on ya, friend.
That's some serious love, right there. Awwwwww!
Beans! r/toefeathers
He loves you 😍
A thief of hearts has struck again!!!
I read a study once where cats were kept away from humans and food for an extended period of time. Upon release, the cats went to humans before the food. Despite what non cat lovers think, cats are very social creatures.
Aww, is that a ragdoll? adorable
LMAO THE CUTEST.

Then "mwa." lmao cuter.
Most probably a Ragdoll cat
Lols
Oh my goodness! You are both so adorable!
Cats are such beautiful creatures.
He loves you, yeah yeah yeah...
Absolutely adorable
My kitty screams until I pick her up.
What a big baby he is! My cat's a bit like that but she starts to wriggle free after about 5 minutes - I assume she enjoys it up until then though! :D
This is just so touching. When cats love you they really are affectionate
He manages to be more adorable than the cat.
Pure bliss
Ragdolls are such chill cats
Can you stop killing me with cuteness??!! Please, I have a limit and you’re exceeding it!!!
Oh to have a call lovingly touch your face ❤️
Love this! One of my cats does the same thing when she wants to be petted. But she only likes to be rubbed on the head no where else. The other one a boy likes to be held. I got them both from the humane society so they’re both feral. When I first got them they stayed under the couch for 2 weeks only coming out for food.

By the way does yours like to visit in the bathroom? All of my animals 2 cats 1 dog always come to visit me on the toilet. It’s like we have a captive audience nowemote:free\_emotes\_pack:joy
That’s a nice kitty cat.
little cloud baby
I would die for this cat
I’d touch that face too!
Awh! Thats a great cat right there.

Aww, my cat will do that sometimes when he's lying on me. Or he'll lie next to me on the back of the couch and put his paw on my shoulder. Makes my heart clench! 😻
haha i feel you brah, first time my cat put his hand on my shoulder sheeeesh😍🙌🥳Best buds meow
I could watch this a thousand times. What a sweet bond. Pure love.
fluffy cat
Confirmed member of the Kitty Club - WELCOME!
Man, that is one beautiful cat.
Omg... look at this floofball filled w love
That little man loves you so much.
This is pretty much how I chose my cat from the shelter, she still does this from time to time and I cherish every moment of it.
Very sweet
My guy does that too!
That's a sweet furry baby u have!
Unconditional love <3
It's funny, if this was a baby the comments would be full of negative comments.
I love the both of you!
You’re a lucky dude. I’m glad the kitty can bring you some joy. :D
The only way to get peace with my Bengal is baby time! 

I love when he puts his paw on my face 🥰
Well that's just fuckin adorable
Holy shit Faris i know you from Instagram your an amazing person 🙏🏼 what are the chances of randomly seeing your posts on my wall?
That look omg
Holy shit you are so cute together, I can't take it.
Cat: “If I were bigger, I’d swat your head off. Never forget that.)
Not a cat person but that cat is adorable!
/r/murdermittens
I love you, too!
Oh sorry to read this! A hug from Chile!
He is so cute 😍 and sounds like a duck which makes it even better 🥰
You're a guy who loves his cat, has a British accent, and can pull off a 5 o'clock shadow? *swoon*
:)
My cat does this when she's held that way, too. Careful, when that paw comes out it's a quantum state. She's either going to just put her paws on you, or she's going to punch you. No way of knowing until the quantum state collapses.
What a sweetie pie.
Awww that cat is gorgeous and clearly loves his human!
Unakaa mkenya
This made my day
Awe kitteh luvs...
I vaguely remember Reddit hates this guy for some reason (I only remembered him because he likes to cosplay as the Persian from Spartan 300).
You got a social breed. Get him a brother or sister to play with. He's a beauty. Thank you for sharing.
Oh my heart, that was so lovely and wholesome. Cats are the best people.
Omg 😭😭😭
You can teach cats to be trusting in this position. It's much easier  if you start when they are kittens. Steady yourself and refrain from going directly for belly scritches as it's a sensitive/vulnerable area.
There's just something so sweet about men and cats :)
If someone hasn't already mentioned r/catsmirin I'd be shocked, but there's too many comments for me to check. Your cat loves you!
Holding a cloud!
Oh, man. That breaks my heart. And the way he looks at you! Such love.
Big meowy babie
r/catsmirin
cat was trying to go for your jugular
Hey! I follow you on instagram!!
That is awesome.  I hope you have many happy years with him.
The smile was a killer, then the kiss and mew!
This was the most wholesome thing I’ve seen in a while. So cute! What a good dad!
he sees his god
One of my cats loves grabbing my beard too
Aww, he loves you!!❤️💕
My cat Frodo would do this every time I held him like that, without fail. Sometimes with both paws, but almost always on my lips.

See you on the other side, buddy.
So cute
I love this!
-*meow*-
My cat touches my nose when I hold her lol
Cute guy, cute cat.  Cute guy with cute cat 🔥
That's the cutest fucking thing. You're cat is gorgeous.
"This is my human"
That is one beautiful kitty. Pure floof
Aww he’s such a precious floof!
The kitty knows
Your best buddy!
So sweet! ❤️

Mine pokes my beard when she wants attention. 😋

This was enough to make a grown woman cry! <3 Much love to you and your fluff.
Aren’t you the Starbucks guy ?
“Rah” 😻
What a sweet bebe.
You pet me i pet you back
I would die for him
A cool cat and a feline.  Same frame.
You are freaking adorable and so is your cat.
That kitty is admiring your beautiful face!
Stupid human... The cat was just looking for his jugular.
My cat has started pawing at me this year. Had to quickly teach her not MANGLE me, but it's cute.
The cat is beautiful but you should be on r/ upvotebecauseboy. The two of you are heartbreakers!
So cute!!
Something weird about that duck
Both of you are too cute!
Bro that thing just quacked.  That's obviously a duck
Mischief maker
Mhe - that clearly is the sound the cat made.
What a beautiful cat!
Such a beautiful baby!
Not sure if cat that sounds like duck, or duck that looks like cat. Cute either way.
Little ragdoll!
That floof not only loves you but is IN LOVE with you!
My cat does exactly this when I stop scratching her head while she's laying there
r/cuteguyswithcats
My Siamese is basically the same. She won’t shut up or stop pestering me until I hold her or let her onto my lap.
That’s so sweet 😭
My neighbor has a Kitty just like that one he visits me almost every day i totally enjoy his company.
He adores you, you lucky man.
Slow slap![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)
Wuv.
So lucky!
 Bruh I thought this was a white guy in well done black face.. I’m logging off
Lol while my cat wakes me up to give him wet food. Lucky you.
贱这个词用英语怎么说。
Melt-worthy for sure!
Keep wanting your car he is damn cute.
Cats are wonderful
What breed is that cutie?
Oh man, he loves you. Look at that gaze! Glad you found each other.
So beautiful 🥰😻
So cute, both of you.
I have a bed booper boy - he wants pets while I'm still asleep (usually around wake up time anyway) and if I stop, he'll gently bring out a paw to pat my face - it's too cute!
The “mow” at the end with the kiss is what got me
He’s beautiful!
He needs to wipe those litter box granules off on something
Cat: I blessed thee
dude that’s so pure!
Sweet
"You too must be blessed by the kitty litter foot dusting fairy..."
Are you the guy from the KFC “Skip the line” commercial?
Y’all are both adorable 😂🥰
Aww, cats make you work for it a bit but it is **so** rewarding
What kind of cat is that?
And your smile is lovely too.
Precious 😍
"Nyan."
Awwwww, that putter loves you.
People actually want co-dependent pets? No way should my cat act out if I don't hold him.
Your cat is gorgeous! I’ve always loved how soft Siamese cats look!
Oooh those beans!
How a cat goes from evil butthead to baby.
i was born in the soviet union, i love cats, i lobe dogs, i love all living organisms... we are the same
THIS. IS. ADORABLE.
Awww he loves you
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen
Touch the hooman on r/touchthafishy
Love this 🥰
Awww he loves you
My Siamese boy would come into the bathroom every morning while I was getting ready for work, jump onto the sink, and proceed to drape himself around my neck unless I grabbed him first for a hug.  He was prepared to be held indefinitely.
he wafs u
In my best Agnes voice *"It's so FLUFFY!"*
Genuinely thought this bruh was wearing a santa hat
Haha the meow at the end :)
Aw!
Both handsome boys!
Weirdo lol
Audio x2
They know, man. They know.
Awww indeed
Kit Cats r da best 🐱
Next level wholesome
Cat: oh mon Cher…
Human: kisses
Cat: ew! Not that!
The floofer is like bish, where you get all this gorgeous melanin from?  Give floofer a touch...
Hang in there
This is so cute
WELLP that’s adorable
You good buddy?
This is exactly how my cat got adopted last year.
Idk, black guys and kitties, kinda sexy
Aww!! My Lil man does this too when we cuddle. Very sweet.
My cat does this too but it’s usually to keep my face away from kissing her.
He LOVES u 😻
I think he lives you as much as you do him. Your whole face gives it away 😍
You deserved that touch-he loves you cuz you treat him well. Good for you!
Only way to find peace? I know how you feel. I have crippling anxiety in the morning as the reality of the day sets in. I don't really like cats but the idea of something like this warms my heart.
Strong Grogu vibes when he reached for your face.
Cayoot
Oh gosh, that meow at the end is the best.
If I stop stroking my spaniel, she taps me with her paw until I start again.i can't work out if she is stroking me back or telling me to focus on her again. Either way, it's adorable.
Awwww! You're his person!
That smile was so infectious. You looked so genuinely happy.
my ragdoll is the same?
This is beautiful
That brought me some peace, too.  Thank you.
“This, this is beautiful.”
One of the prettiest cats I’ve ever seen!
He loves his human! Those fluffy toe beans.
Awwwww 🥰🥰🥰 this is so cute, I love it!
Awww & the look on his face he's melting, too😽
🥰 he loves you so much!!
So sweet! That beautiful kitty loves you!!
Looks like a Ragdoll. They are without a doubt the most affectionate of cats
r/catsmirin
That little rowr at the end!
Just saw this/you on TT now I’m seeing you here. Too adorable.
Beautiful cat!
You have my cat Atticus- looks identical
This is the best thing I’ve seen all year ps are you single 😬😬😬
Touched by an angel lmao
this is a 'rag-doll' cat, we have one.

they like to be carried on their back, rag-doll style
Deep meow
Aww!  So precious!
I love the little “mweeh” sound he makes. Sounds like a duck! 😂 So cute!!!
