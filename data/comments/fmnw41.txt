"If you don't leave, how can I get away with stuff?"
“So if you’re home... and you’re not throwing the ball... are you really home?”
There is CLEARLY something he wanted to do but can’t do because you’re there all the time. 10/10 good boy.
He's usually on your laptop at this time, checking out poodles on Tinder.
[deleted]
"We're goin to the vet, aren't we?!"
My Ghost is a white German too, he’s also quite confused, but loving having us all home!
I’m on to you hooman
Serious suspicious vibes.
When you finally escape your grumpy boss in your office but encouter another one inside your house.
He's figuring it out, r/humansarentreal and r/humansdontexist
[removed]
Love the squinty eye
He's wondering when you'll leave so he can go do the things he gets yelled at for when he's not alone
“Sooo hooman... you’re home but no walkies yet? “
Is that a white German Shepherd? I’ve always wanted one I had a black one when I was a kid and he was the best dog I’ve ever owned
Clearly that Dire Wolf is just figuring out the right moment to pull that greasy aluminum foil that you cooked chicken on last night out of the trash.
He’s thinking “ why haven’t you gone to work, I need to have me time “
He has dog stuff to do.  Have you not seen the dog-umentary "The Secrect Life of Pets"?
“Mm..shit you got fired didn’t you? You’re just telling me slowly, so I won’t panic.”
Dudes got a killer poker face.
He hsd a poker game with the boys set up and you're there. It screws things up.
That dog - I ain't falling for this shit again.
Your dog looks like a giant albino bat.
r/petthedamndog
Say, what’s going on?  Why aren’t you out earning my keep?  Lol

Love the look on his face!
He's going to go ahead and send you another memo about the TPS report.
"Did you get fired?  WHO'S GOING TO BUY ME SNACKIES THEN? " 🤔
Ghost does not approve😂
Our dogs are doppelgänger’s
[My Dog Mo](https://imgur.com/a/GhJCeTb)
"God damn it Karen did you get fired again?"
These poor animals have no idea what's going and they are not able to get away with their usual shenanigans now. Very pretty dog!!
Listen here, bucko
It’s Saturday...
[deleted]
"He better not be taking me to the vet"
Your dog looks so strangely wise. Like he’s going to spill some secret about the universe, but doesn’t know if you’re ready to take it.
"Now I can't chew on that shoe I stole with this bastard home."
If you are at work, then why aren't you wearing pants?
He's listening intently
If this dog could talk I bet it’d sound like Sam Elliot. Seems like a take no crap kinda dog
*Lemme guess.  They chopped off your balls too?*
Gah! *that face*

I live for when animals just have that *that face*
Im having to work major overtime because of the virus and my dogs are sad Im not home
"Ghost dog" is one of my favorite movies, it's a really werid early movie of Forest Whitaker.
I just love all these posts of pets having various reactions to their owners being home 24/7.
“Excuse me, this is me time.”
A little judgemental as well, it seems!  Too cute!
"What the fuck are you doing at home, Steve?!"
He's got questions and he wants answers
"Why are you here. This is my time to walk around on two legs."
"So every other day you left for 'work' was just total bullshit huh?"
"You got fired. Didn't you?"
If you squint he kinda looks like a muscle kangaroo
You sure that’s not a blonde kangaroo?
Dog: last time you did this you brought me to get my nuts cut off
Are you sure this is a dog and not a kangaroo
Looks like a super dog unable to perform his civic duty due to his owner being home all day.
You're infringing on his ball licking time
That face says "I was gunna have my bitches over for some sniffing today man... why you snout blocking me!?
He's waiting to go and fuck your pillow.
After day 3: So you got fired? 

After day 14: This is not working Hooman. Although I have enjoyed the extra treats
 Cool name for a cool pup
Sooooo funny🥰
Lab/Colley cross?
Say nothing.
What a are you doing hooman
“Will you leave already, I need to scratch my butthole on your pillow”
Awww. My pup looks exactly like this and his name is Ghost too (After Jon Snow’s dire wolf) !!!
He had a girl coming over and you screwed it up..
"Hold the bone, something isn't right here."
That's some radar dishes your kid has there.
Thats not a ghost silly.
You are interrupting his nap time
"why are you harshing my mellow?"
"I'd like to see you in my office Carl."
And he WILL extract the information.
What a beauty
“Hey! This is my spot for napping!” :)
Your dog look's exactly like my old dog, Buck.  Like... 100% match.
That is one handsome dog!
So you lost your job huh
"I bet you're here to take me to the vet. I'm on to you..."
Love the name. GOT reference, right?
Is that a white Shepherd?
Today is Saturday
Day 3: hooman no leave yet????
He reminds me of Leonard Nimoy for some reason.
I see HP on that shelf, I’m assuming there’s also ASOIAF there too
Now that you aren’t working, bring me some coockies
My dog is also named Ghost!! My boy is a pitbull terrier mix and fully deaf
I love Ghost and he is a good boy.
I believe this is a dog smile. He's smiling at you because you're home.
My human forgot it’s work day, I wonder.
“Human, why are you not wearing any pants by now?”
He's not mad, just disappointed.
Looks like he’s mad at you for interrupting his “me” time
Mmmm hmm , I see this human wants to stay with me all day now , I will stare at him until he gives me my allotted space we agreed upon at the beginning of this relationship 

-DOG
He looks like he just smoked
Aw, I also have a white German Shepherd named Ghost. She’s about to turn one and loving that we’re home all day.
I wish ghost would haunt me
"Frustrated Dog Has No Time To Jerk Off Now That Owner Home All Day." - Onion headline.
Ya dog looks like a fackin kangaroo mate.
If dogs had a Police Chief...
"Are you really working or just wasting time on Reddit?"
Preparing to judge you.
fry stare meme
He's giving you the Larry David expression
Lol
Thats a great name for your dog
Hahaha I love this expression. What a handsome pup!
I'm getting Anderson Cooper vibes
its literally saturday lmfao.
“You’re home and yet you’re not paying attention to me. Weird...”
Larry David vibes
His name is ghost? Ask him where he was for the last half of the series.
r/batdogs
All jokes aside Your dog looks like a chad
LOOK AT THAT ADORABLE FACE
Your dog is beautiful! I see those Eragon, Narnia, and Harry Potter books in the background 👀
Secret life of pets gettin’ blown to hell due to quarantine.
That's one handsome ass dog
Seeing all these posts about dogs wondering why we are at home is making me wonder if they are secretly keeping our society together while we are at work
"I'm gonna have to ask you to leave, I have a lot of stuff to do and you can't be here to watch."
"please leave, i got to bite the sofa's
He is pissed because he can't watch dog porn.
“I can’t poop in your shoes when you’re watching!”  -the dog probably.
You are interfering with nap time
He’s looking at you like you’re sitting in his chair.
He protecc
He attacc 
But most importantly,
He suspecc
Looks like a suspicious father
Just an FYI.. he's totally not buying any of ur shit rn.
Does he not watch the news?
It looks so real for being a ghost.

Is it a ghost, or did you forget to use a comma?
I wonder if some animals are really bummed out that their humans are home every day now.
This dog looks like a top animal actor.
.... I was gonna have the boys over.... why tf are you still home?
This dog reminds me of Richard Gear and I'm not sure why.
Are you plotting on me hooman?
He had invited some bitches over.
If you have Ghost, you have everything
That is the most “boss” face ever!
He wants you out so he can wreck the sofa.
You are intruding his privacy, Sir.
youre gonna have munny for, TREETS , RIGHT
Beautiful dog
I'm sorry, but I have to inform you that your dog may be a member of the mafia using your home to conduct illegal activities. Ugh. Look at those EARS.
"Be honest with me _Wolf-Track_, did you get fired again?"
Ghost is certain you were fired.

"What did you do?"
"The fuck you doing here? I can't chew the couch while you're here."
*Not sure if work from home day or day off to take me to vet day.*
My dog’s dad’s name was ghost! https://i.imgur.com/KLkRNaY.jpg
Maybe he doesn't understand work from home, and he's just thinking you better not lose the house!
“Home again huh”
He’s giving me Handsome Squidward vibes.
Last time I saw this much of you I came back two walnuts short... I don’t trust this.
“Why are you still home.....are you here to stop me from ripping us the toilet paper?”
Dog looks like cop.
He can tell the difference between a workday and the weekend?
The antennas are up.
“Why are you looking at this...this *book* instead of petting me?”
he knows things you don't know.
What kind/s of dog ? Looks a little like mine and we’re not sure what breeds she is (rescue)
"So, you could have been here the entire time..."
Between this and the pug one, I get the feeling a lot of dogs are having this scenario.
My dog stuck her nose up my asshole
"You will walk me now."
He knows.
So I know this is a joke but I wanted to let you know when dogs look at you with their eyes slightly closed they are trying to give you a “look of love”. I read that once and it made me happy bc my dog looks at me like that a lot
I love the name Ghost for a white dog! So cute
Secret life of pets..  ur messing up their plans
Good Boy
Hmmmm!
You know nothing, Jon Snow
Made my night! Beautiful dog!
What type of dog is this?
Real question.  Do you think our dogs can tell the difference between a work day and a weekend?
Looks like a mad kangaroo hybrid
He wants to wreck the house
I'd like to have THAT nose full of nickels!! You cute.
🤨
What breed is that pooch?
Nice
"Hmm.. HMMM!"
I can hear OP sweating from here. The jig is up!
I enjoyed the Eragon BOOK series as well
this must be very confusing for a lot of animals
Now I know what I'm missing out
You got work at home to work on.  Tell him not to be so suspicious.
wow you have a nice dog how much do you make per year
“what are you gonna do? Cut my balls off again?”
That’s a man in a dog suit
Other than the name - super cute dog!
Needs glasses
[Perhaps you should read this.](https://local.theonion.com/frustrated-dog-has-no-time-to-jerk-off-now-that-owner-h-1842396795)
What kind of dog is Ghost?

Got my boy Bolt from the pound and he looks similar, would love to know what breed/breeds he is.
Hmmmmm HMMMMMMMM
Can other people see your dog ghost as well?
If he’s like my shepherd he’s not getting to lay on the sofa in your absence.
I am reminded of Sam Elliott for some reason
He looks so much like my doggo, Benji! Same big ol' ears and colouring.
“Who are you and what did you do to my dad!”
😅🤣🤣🤣
Beautiful Dog!!!
"I'll allow it."
Your dog is my late dog's identical twin.  I was shocked when I saw that picture.
Lol I love the suspicion
Looks a lot like my dog!!!
I also have a white dog named Ghost...
"Dude can you not, I told my bitch to come over and you being here makes it real akward".
[deleted]
so much judgment 😄
😂😂😂
YOU MUST GO TO WORK OR ELSE WE’LL STARVE
Not sure if home or just stupid
Pretty doggo
Sceptical af. Lol
Did you get fired? Am I going to have to get a job to support your ass?
Cuttiee
Is that Brisingr on the bookshelf? Good ass book
Last time this happened you took me to get fixed -_-
Hey your dog has the same name as my dog copycat!
There is a plot. I shall figure it out.
https://youtu.be/_lFAVLWJhpY
“This is my fart time. Why are you here, Daniel??”
You smell that ass?
He totally looks suspicious, also maybe put out he can't do his normal "No, Ghost!" activities while you're home. ;)
That is definitely a look expressing suspicion.
Looks like you interrupted his party plans. He looks very annoyed.
“What’s your play here, Karen?”
My 7 month old GSD hasn't completed crate training yet, so he's usually defiant with me when I send him to crate in the mornings.  This is day 5 of me working from home.  The GSD trotted into his crate this morning and looked across the room at me like "hey...are you going to go to work at some point?"
He isn’t buying your bullshit for a second.
*japanese accent*  still here... Ha... Most curious
In a couple weeks he's going to be verrrrrry disappointed when you aren't at home to play all the time
Wait did he eat my mushrooms
“Ok, you should’ve been gone by now human. Wth is going on here?”
That, or he's squinting from the light and thinking...

"Yesm. You keep do human thing, I keep on do doggo thing, we both keep doing forever, yes."
are we going to the vet?.....
What breed is he/she?
Suspicious dog is suspicious.
Did Bob find the poop? How can I know he's not punishing me for finding the poop? What is he DOING to me...?
"Get out of my house and go make Ghost daddy some bread."
He's thinking, you only stay home if you're taking me to the vet, I'm watching you...
“How can hooman see me. Hooman must be ghost too.”
Ghost? Looks more like Tommy if you ask me.
This dog needs Texas fields.
Kinda looks like he is judging you too
This is the second priceless pet look I get to see from people in quarantine, their beloved non humans are becoming Reddit stars and should win Oscars, lol
"I should be snoozing in preparation for your return, but you never left.  What the heck?!"
“John when are you gonna be honest and tell me you got fired, someone’s gotta bring home the beggin strips and I’m an inside dog”
All pets are now questioning if their owners ever really had to "go to work"
So cute!
Why was I immediately reminded of Markiplier?
More screen time than what we got in season 8
you made my day,ahha..
They are a loooooooot of books. What are you OP?
Man even I feel judged by Ghost... lol
Holy shit! [We have Ghost’s twin!](https://imgur.com/a/4TLh2)
Your home and your just sitting there.  There is a world out there of paths,  sunshine,  trees and scents.   Yet your just sitting there.  Why?   Tell me I know your up to something?  I'm watching you very closely... you'll slip and I'll find out.
He totally has that what'd you think your doing here look.
"You got fired didn't ya hooman? I know you did. This will not go over well in your yearly assessment from the Dog Council."
"........You got fired, didn't you?"
My first reaction would be, “Give me some Space Ghost!”
He's beautiful
So many confused pets! The poor things don't know why their owners are home so much...
Kinda looks like he's tired of your shit Karen
Cute doggo
I too have a Ghost. Here he is sleeping on a Yeti. https://imgur.com/gallery/oddabRZ
Classic. 🤣😂
He has shit to do, he’s waiting for you to leave.
Your title gets you upvotes.  So crazy
Scooby Doo's cousin.
Or he’s high as hell but who knows.
 Can’t get up to mischief with you home all the time!
he no attacc right now

he no snacc right now

&#x200B;

but he surely SUSPECC right now the fishy thing!
He's judging you left & right!
I can feel the judgement from here. I'm ashamed.
🤣😂
I’m in the same camp. I got barked at, directly at, a lot this week....
He had a party planned and now you're in the way. Go to bed.
“I will NOT be a homeless dog”!
Hmmmmmmm
Was Ghost ever a British special forces operator and second in command of Task Force 141 and was seen wearing dark red sunglasses and a skull-patterned balaclava along with a headset?
maybe he's guarding you from the virus... watchful eye....
My dog was super cute excited the first day my husband stayed home to work because she thought it was another Saturday. Every day since she’s been more reluctant to be excited.  I hope she can have another one exciting Saturday in her life.
"Something's wrong, I can feel it"
Omegalol
Are you invading his space and he wants you to leave so he can do whatever he/she lies as per usual?
Does your dog smoke dope?
“Dude, get the fuck out here don’t you have human shit to do”
Wow I seriously thought I was looking at a picture of my wgsd❤️
Ghost writing in his diary: "Day 5.  He's STILL in my spot!"
He is sitting there judging you.
I have a white shepherd too!  His name is Radar.  He’s a momma’s boy though.  He’s more prissy than our female pit lol
Your intruding on his private time...
He definitely gets high when you go to work
“Why did you name me Ghost if you can see me?”
This dog looks so healthy.
My cat has been noticing too that were all home all the time now.

She’s excited because it’s like, WOW YOURE YOME ALL THE TIME WE CAN DO ALL THE THINGS, she loves to play and get brushes and cuddle and walk around and see the house with me

But now that we’re always home, she’s like WOW YOURE HOME WEVE HOTTA DO THI- oh... actually... wait this is nap time I’m gonna nap...

But she doesn’t realize she wants to nap until she nags me to come pay attention to her and begin brush/play or whatever and THEN she goes oh right no I’m actually gonna go sleep
"Hmmm..."
We have three huskies and they have all been like “wtf are you doing here?” Giving us the stink eye constantly
Handsome dog and choice of fantasy literature.
"I need you to work 40 hours per week minimum to afford my treats"

Your Ghost looks so much like my uncles white GSD. His name was Ghost. I miss that dog.

Just don’t let him near a shepherd
My beautiful [TG](https://imgur.com/gallery/AEHQnju) says hi. I swear they could be related.
"ARE YOU HERE TO USURP GHOST?"
You better have my bark box on the 15th
He needed some special time with your wife.
Wondering if you have Corona Virus.
"Ok, let me run through this again before I..."
He is the one who watches the watchman. Please give him scritches on all our behalf.

This is a change, a welcome change, but a change nonetheless

Hey! That's *my* dog [Ghost](https://imgur.com/ARtO4Qb), sir.
He sure hears about your every move, such a beautiful dog!
I don’t think he is suspicious, I think he is high af. Time to have a talk.
He looks like a drill Sargent
Why am I getting Kangaroo Jack vibes?
“You’re home but not playing with me. Does that mean I was a good boi or a bad boi?”
“What time is it?...”
He looks great! What breed is he?
*visible suspicion*
What breed is your dog?
Please tell me your dog is named after the dog in the Joe Ledger books by Jonathan Mayberry. The bestest boy in any books I’ve read!
That’s an amazing name for a dog
Am I still going to get fed if you are not going out.
You get to the bottom of this Ghost
That’s such a boring basic name lmao wack
Never seen a dog look so much like clint Eastwood
What a beautiful dog.
I love him hahahaha
"I pooped on the floor and the human hasn't noticed yet. Do I have time to clean it up?"
Are you sure your dog isn’t Batman? Does he disappear at night and come back with bones (human bones..)
What will we eat in the future homan?
"You can't be here now!"
Messing with his schedule.

That dog looks built. 😳
He thinks it’s vet time lmao

Those ears! That suspicious & slightly judge-y look! Ghost is gorgeous!
Is that a Lab-Shepard mix?
Lol. Great pic.

This dog probably has a deep human voice.
SO PRECIOUS! Aww

My daughters give me the same look when I call them on their bullshit.
Your pup looks eerily similar to mine! She has been way too excited about mom and dad being home though
"Does you still have a job? I need food and treats yaknow?!"
Nice dog...  i could say beautiful but all dogs are 

We humans dont deserve them 😶
Dang!!!!
"Hmmmmmm"
Stock analysts?
Gorgeous doggie
I've always found it very interesting how dog owners manage to attribute human emotions to dogs despite seeing their faces everyday and having been used to it.
[deleted]
My dog has been doing this all week. (You mean you could just be home all the time with me and your not?)
Did you name him after the dog in the Joe Ledger series?
Ghost looks like my dog’s sibling. Give Ghost some pats for me. Tell Ghost that Mando says hi!!
Looks like a buff kangaroo.
Mozam?
Ghost is keeping an eye on the sitch.
Good Dog.
I got a scared for a second because I have a white Shepard-Husky also named Ghost (I didn't have a say in the name) and thought my mom had a Reddit. The I noticed it wasn't the same, thankfully
YES

Also dog is very cute!
I have your dog, but in negative. And also named Ghost: Ghost https://imgur.com/gallery/u9MRX4m
I’ve been seeing a lot of these. But this by far is the best. the eye squint haha too funny!
So... can I pet him?
Awe he's so cute. My dog is also wondering why I'm always home now too.
Look at him just sitting there, judging.
What breed is he?
Inheritance, Harry Potter, Narnia... you have a good little collection of books there OP
Brodie Lee
Pet him to ease suspicion
he is a handsome boi
It's the weekend.
Why is he named Ghost?
That is a German Shepard whose schedule has been disrupted. I've said it in another thread; It's not good to disappoint a German Shepard's sense of timing and order.
OMG, your dog looks EXACTLY like the white shepherd my family had when I was about 5 y.o. Coolest dog ever! Used to share my ice cream cones with him.
Your dog is absolutely beautiful
He thinks you're gonna take him to get his balls off
God dogs are literally the most adorable creatures
Remind me of Dogbert
I love your ghost 👻
What a beautiful pic. :)

I have a long-haired black GSD and since I work from home I only get that look when I'm getting ready to go out without her.
What breed is this?
A dog? Where?
“You’re interrupting my nap.”
"This is not the living arrangements I had in mind."
He's sooooo cuuuuuttttteeee
My mom's face when I told her my stomach hurt in the morning before school. 🤦‍♀️🤣
He was trying to have some bitches come over.
I love white GSD's.

Throw the damn ball already.
Is that a White German Shepherd?
He can’t have his sexy parties with the local bitches while you’re home.
I'd honestly die for Ghost.
"hmmmmm...."
“You lost your job again, didn’t you Greg.”
those EARS
Lol! That look!
You are getting very sleepy...
You still have enough money to buy me treats, right?
My German Shepherd 
, Max, gives me the same look...I call him Judge Maxwell. He’s constantly judging me.
My dog Ghost is also very suspicious of why I’m home all day now
"Hey did you get fired? Huh? How's this gonna affect our food supply? Did you think about how it might affect me?"
What a beautiful dog! Looks a lot like my father in law's dog Randy. He's a big 100+ pound baby who's part shepherd and part wolf (at least according to their vet). Has HUGE paws.
My dog, Ghost, is...

I was trying to figure out what a dog Ghost was.
I'm listening to ghost rn
"What would you say you do here...?"
That dog wants you to leave, hes got shit to do already and youre fucking it up
Cough on him
If you have ghost you have everything
-makes same face as dog-
Don’t know if I know this dog, or just every white dog like this is named Ghost these days.
you cuttin in to my daily nap time and not even throwing the toy.
Ghost has a smart face.
There's a white GSD named Ghost where I work...
Pandemic, huh? A likely story...
Dog: did you get fired
Yo
"I know you're just trying to sabotage my playtime, Karen."
Haha this is awesome. Love his expression!
He's (she's?) beautiful.
"You sonafabitch..."
Why is this hooman always at home. Play with me from now on. That looks.
German Shepard?
Soooo cute
Joey: " I think my character will look suspicious".
*...did you get fired again?*
No wonder, after the last time you stayed home you made him do that thing with the peanut butter

What kind of dog?
Damn, when can I play with his toilet paper?
you're totally stepping on his "me" time
Look at that burning, soul searching glare.
YOOOOO I also have a White German Shephard named Ghost
ghost looks like he’s gonna very quickly get tired of you
Damn, that's a good looking dog
(I think Ghost got high like usual, then realized you were home.)
Awwww
It's either, your dogs name is ghost, or I'm witnessing a poltergeist rn
"Human, why on this day of which you usually partake in breaking my heart by leaving, do you stay home? What sort of game are you playing with me?"
“You say you have to go to work to buy my food, treats and toys....I really love you, but Treats.”
Yes, I am judging you right now
He's wondering why you smell like a Chinese bat
"Not sure if serious."
OMG his moustache. The boss is ANGERY.
Ghost reportin'
Y you no leave
Looks it. adorable
LMAO HIS FACE LOOKS SUSPICIOUS BUT HE'S A DOG
Love your book selection in the background ❤️📚
Lol my pup is so out of routine. He's not sure what to think
[removed]
"Why you here...i got things to do. Dog things to do that don't involve witnesses. "
That is one handsome pupper.
If you'd please come with me, I have a few questions for you. I assure you, it's standard procedure.
that dog is very serious
Please tell ghost I love him 😍 Swiss white shepherd mix?
You are invading my personal space, bro.
Kinda like when you had plans to watch porn all day and yoinks parents decided to work from home.
Dude my dog looks identical! He’s a rescue and I wanna know what breed. What breed is yours!?
Boy is he pretty.
You took a photo at the best possible moment.  He does actually look skeptical.
Very well titled. Priceless!
Goddamn perfect meme template.
He's trying to figure out a way to carry on with his "taking over the world" plan now that you're home all day. haha The secret life of Ghost.
You need to go to work so I can sleep on your bed
Are his thoughts in the voice of Morgan Freeman or Patrick Stewart? Go.
We have a white German Shepherd and we spend so much money on purple shampoo to keep her coat white. An all black dog sounds amazing at this point.
Excellent post
Carnt do his normal day to day stuff looking at u like  why u stoping me doing my thing on a day to day just cause u at home 😂😂😂
"I was planning on tunneling into the neighbor's fridge this week while you were at work. Since you're here, you want in? There's no way I can eat it all anyway."
He's like  "what did you do?did you get fired again?
“You’re really gunna be here all day? I planned on shitting in the floor and eating it before you got home.”
".. Boy, this is your 7th job."
He is surprised you didn't 'ghosted' him today!!
I’m so confused by his surroundings and this perspective... Just stared at it for like United and now my head hurts lol
It looks like you foiled Ghost's big plans for the day.
“Did you quit your job?”
Jesus, did reddit send out a memo demanding these kind of posts??
Hey, this is his "Me" time.
GORGEOUS DOGGO
Haha. He is absolutely onto you
Cute... Is that a rabbit, deer or a horse?
What breed is your dog? I want one so bad!!
Cats don’t judge 🐈
r/suspiciousdoggo
Nice
Is it... Vet day? :(
That’s a kangaroo!
Tilda Swinton vibes from your dog tbh
I want to flop those ears so badly
Hahahahaha
Yeaahh so this is not a half-day M’kay?
Ghost ain't supposed to be suspicious when he's a ghost himself.
Great looking doggo! I also have a white shepard and she is wondering why I am home as well!
r/rarepuppers
Me: Okay now listen here fuzz ball! You are cute and adorable but this is where I draw the line! No more treats! I'm sorry but it must be done!
My Dog: *Slightly tilts head*
Me: Just take them all! I'm way too weak...
But the sofa is miiiiiiine until 5pm.
Reminds me of an hidden video of this dog laying on owner’s bed and humping on owner’s pillow after the owner leaves the house.
My dog used to have the same problem! I always felt guilty leaving him behind, once I stayed home for a week's holiday he was not just confused, he actively kept me out of his room, making it clear he wanted me to leave. As soon as weekend came round he normalised. Dogs are incredible things.
Omg, how can you work at all with that face staring at you??!
Do you read the Joe Ledger books by chance?
He indeed looks suspicious.
Is he here to neuter me AGAIN?!?!
That look goes to the deepest part of your soul
"Umm, sir..... This is my spot."
“The only time your off through the week is when you’re gonna take me to the vet”😑😑😑
I think he got into the edibles again
Can someone tell me what dog race this is pls?
Sorry for your loss
"Human, explain yourself"
is this about he missing crackers? i thought we went over that...

human...
He kind of looks like Bojack Horseman to me.
Nice book selection!
Beautiful!!!
My dog is a little over 10 years old.  How old are yours?
It took me way too long to realize the dog’s name is Ghost.
He reminds me of some police cartoon dog for some reason. Can't quite put my finger on it
AWWWWEEEE LMAOOOO THIS IS PURRFECT!!!!!!!
Ghost is a handsome boy🙂...stay safe during this crisis
No he is just wondering why aren’t you playing with him
How am I supposed to nap when you're making all this noise
Hmmmmm.. I smell cat breath....
He probably said " this bitch got fired, and he's trying to hide it and be nonchalant about it", ain't nobody fooling Ghost!
Ok tell me why this dog looks like my brother’s ex girlfriend’s dog. If your name is Ashley, you dated my brother Kyle for a bit and got him into the show “once upon a time.”
You are definitely being judged.
Spock was reincarnated as a pupper. 🖖
That look says “you’re lying, I’m not sure why.”
Looks like a kangaroo
Light skin ppl be like...

Ah dun want it
Is his name ghost, or is he a ghost😂
Sorry to tell you this, but your dog Ghost can't count and thus never knows if it's supposed to be a work day or not.

Anthropomophizing animals is a bad survival strategy.
He's probably just pissed you gave him some shitty over popularized derivative name from GOT.
