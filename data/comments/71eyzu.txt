You're a good girl Frida.
I hope she gets free roam of a toy store.
Frida is a good girl and hero  for certain but the number saved in the earthquake was 12. She has over 50 saves in her career though.

The first 17 times this was posted I just assumed the dog's name was Marina...
Grande Frida! Saludos desde Espa√±a guapa!! Sigue trabajando!!
Regardless of 1 earthquake save or 500, Frida deserves all of the treats and love for her help and accomplishments! 15/10 would pet Frida!!! STELLAR DOG BRANT!
My Dad is about to get on the plane headed to Mexico with LA Country USAR!

I've been in the military almost 3 years and this dog is doing more than me. üëèüèΩ
Some heroes wear little boots  https://i.imgur.com/hzT3qlH.jpg https://i.imgur.com/WopN6OU.jpg https://i.imgur.com/bftD1Kp.jpg 
I definitely know who the good girl is! 
dog bless
The goggles she's wearing are RexSpecs! We got a pair for my golden who lost an eye due to a tumor. (We wanted to protect his only good eye on walks in the woods) They take a little to get them used to but they look awesome and he can still see great with them on.
Frida sweetie you're doing amazing 
I tried to get some boots for my Corgi like that but her little legs are too much like stumps.
Frida you're doing great sweetie
Frida is awesome and she looks so dapper!
She looks like she knows how bad this is, and is sad.
As impressive as that is, I'm also amazed by the PPE for dogs. 
Good dog!
Good girl! 
*El perro, el perro, es mi coraz√≥n*
What a good girl, however it looks like she has had just about enough of this shit!
All doggos are good doggos, but this doggo is best doggo üê∂ 
LPT: Marina is Spanish for ‚ÄúNavy‚Äù. She‚Äôs part of the Mexican navy. Stop saying that‚Äôs her name.
Good Girl!!!
Good dog.

Awesome doggles too!
Thats a tired pup right there
You go girl. 
Frida needs rear foot protection as well.   
r/dogswithjobs
El Bueno Doggo!
Dogs are so awesome, generous, and selfless. We could learn a thing or two.
It's strange to think this dog knows more Spanish than me. 
This dog has done more with its life than I have done with mine. 
What a golden pupper. Living proof that Dogs are man's best friend.
But does she know who's a good doggie?
Frida free da ppl
Youre doing great sweetie
Good girl :)
I like her little booties.

"Who's a good girl? You're a good girl!"
53 and counting... this girl just saved my soul
The real MVP!!!!! üôåüèæüëèüèæ
Good girl
She didn't save 52 people in Mexico, she saved about 20 between Oaxaca and CDMX. The 52 include all her career, that means haiti, ecuador, guatemala, and mexico's disasters.
What a good doggo! I have a yellow lab. He doesn't save lives... Just likes to launch himself into windows and try to hump his younger brothers. 
# Good Girl

# Very, very good
Since myself and this savior share a name, I of course have saved every comment praising Frida by name so I can look back at it when having a bad day. 

This isn't awww it's badass.  Semper Fido Marine Doggo.     
I hope she doesn't get stressed like the 9/11 dogs did in the beginning.
[Here's Frida, taking a break right now](https://i.imgur.com/Z5P1Y9h.jpg).
I see kitten mittons has expanded to the dog market.
Any dog that wears all that without freaking out should get all the treats.

There she is having some well deserved rest. Shes a good girl

Good girl Frida!! Your such a good girl! 
Is there any science behind if she can grasp what she's doing? Does she understand she's saving people or is it a game to her?

she looks so tired 
How many of them were those bad hombres our precedent warned us about? Checkmark agnostics!
Dem lil bootsies 
Frida earns a lifetime of chew toys and biscuits!
I just want to give her endless hugs and treats <3 endless!
God bless you Frida
God bless your work Frida.
And God bless your handlers.
Goodest girl ever
Is there anywhere we may send treats and toys to her and all the other rescue dogs?
Aaaaaaaah the goggles!!!!!
Frida looks like she's about to give out some serious snuggles after saving everyone. 
My mother was in Mexico City during the earthquake of 85 and from what my dad told me she helped out as a makeshift nurse to help out people. She went by Frida and she was the best mom ever, so naturally this gets my upvote and a smile from me :)
Angel covered in fur. Love. 
Bless her soul üíó
She's a good girl ‚ù§Ô∏è
We don't deserve dogs 

G L O V E B O Y E E
Never more fitting time than this for the phrase, "good dog"
And she has lovely little boots üê∂üíñ
People saw her coming and were like "Thank God It's Frida"
What has mankind done to deserve dogs?
r/dogswithjobs
What did we do to deserve dogs?
You can just call her Frida; animal names do not require quotation marks. 
Fine. I'll ask.

Why is Frida in quotation marks?
Wow! And she's a doge Marine!
Doggles.
Good girl!
Frida is so cool she puts up with doggles and dhoes and still does her job.
Is that a US Marine behind that good dog?

Edit: apparently the Mexican federal police have a utility uniform with a copy of MARPAT.
We must knight her immediately!
Myheart.
You wanna get on my good side trump!? 

Give this dog a Medal of Honor for being a good doggo
She looks like she's about to say "I'm too old for this shit"
Good girl
She needs back socks! 
I just made a noise I didn't know a 24 year old man could make seeing this.
V good Doggo!!
The goodest of girls 
In the name of all that is holy, find this dog and do a "After I told her she's a good girl" meme photo.  PLEASE!!!!!
Isn't it amazing that if the saved people could have somehow, somewhere read their destinies where it would have been written: "Will almost die in an earthquake. Will be saved by a dog.", they would have definitely not believed it?

This shouldn't be on r/aww this should be on r/badassasfuck 
She just does it for the treats. Dogs that are trained to find people like this have to be given treats after every person they find or else they stop looking for people. A bit greedy if you ask me.



Just kidding of course, this dog is a hero :)
If pinned under some concrete or other heavy material, have a dog wearing goggles come up on me, I'd be comforted, assume gonna make it. Dog wearing goggles is some serious shit
It's fine that everyone is feeling joy for this wonderful hero Frida; however, one thing to keep in mind is that many of the heroes scouring rubble in this tragic event are going to possibly have severe health problems in the future months/years. Let's keep that in mind, because these people and animals are making a tremendous sacrifice. God bless Mexico! God bless America!
And was rewarded with 52 good girl
She should give back Marinas vest.

Got respect for Frida.
Meanwhile you have some shitty cultures out there, that are fine with eating dogs.  
I'm surprised the rear paws aren't protected as well. After building collapses I'd expect there'd be broken glass everywhere. 

EDIT: NM https://i.imgur.com/bftD1Kp.jpg
What an amazing dog, Lassie ain't got nothing on Frida!
I'm wondering if she was named after the famous Mexican painter/icon [Frida Kahlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frida_Kahlo)
¬°Muchas gracias Frida! Eres una buena perra. :)
WTG Frida.  I'm also glad to see they are protecting her feet and her eyes!  Good Girl! 
*If we could read the minds of animals, we would find only truths.*

This quote explains all one needs to know about dogs.
Who's a good girl 
Go Frida!!
/r/dogswithjobs
This dog is harder than I could ever hope to be 
Anybody know of a way i can send this good girl some treats? Or make a donation to her, uh, work group? 
As a former military member, where is her ear pro. She is not mission ready.
Good pupper
My dogs name is Frida too! She may or may not be as brave as this Frida.

Edit: a letter
That's a good dog!
Top doggo.
That's one badass, Spanish-barking dog.
Good girl Frida. And good going for her handler. 
Who's a good girl? yea you are aren't you!
HORAH
I fucking love frida 
Go, Frida!
Good doggy!
#Present hero of the universe
Mexican Marines wear wear the same pattern as our Marines? Interesting. 
It's amazing what dogs can do.
Good girl Frida. I'll buy you some rear shoes too if you need. 
She's a hero the world needs.
Good puppy! 
Who's a good hero??
Cute little thing, here have a karma
I hope those good things stay safe through aftershocks and secondary disasters, along with people of course. Her going into half-collapsed buildings is a really scary sight.
Bless this angel and everyone working to help the people in mexico. So heartbreaking 
I've read that for really bad disasters, rescue dogs get sad when they can't find anyone alive. In such cases they'll have a rescuer pretend to be found by the dog to cheer the rescue pupper up. Such good puppers. The very best puppers.
Well. I should just give up now. This dog is far more than I could ever hope to be. A very good girl.
Look at her little goggles!
Good girl!

I dunno, Looks like a Marina to me.
Not all heroes wear capes. Some wear the cutest damn doggy water shoes I've ever seen.


Sure her names not 'Marina'? xD
All doggos go to toy heaven. Every. Single. one. Of. Them.
52 confirmed good girls.
Good dog. However many pets she gets, it isn't enough.
She is Mexican celebrity now even my grandma told me about her 
Hehe her little front shoes
[deleted]
Marina is the Organisation she ,,works,, for
She is a strong dog and a good trainer

Jesus christ look at those little slippers. I. Can't. Handle. It.
Is there a way that I could donate some money towards buying Frida a toy or some treats?
What a heckin good doggo
Hard working dogs, hard working people. All with hearts of gold and souls headed to whatever the greatest rewards are for the good samaritans that help those who need it. 
Frida is a good girl and hero for certain but the number saved in the earthquake was 12. She has over 50 saves in her career though. You may  be cool but never be Frida :) :) 
Guess I'm just stoned but I read this title as Frida being a human woman and I didn't read the subreddit and thought it was an article about an amazing real life superhero till now
It‚Äôs unreal how amazing dogs are, they best give her the biggest damn treat ever, what a hero dog 
/u/bexnoodles19
It's amazing what a trained animal and a human can do. 
If only my Lab were that useful.
Good dog Frida!! 
looks like diamond dog from MGS5
Good doggo
Good girl, Frida!
And still manages to look cute in that outfit, good dog. 
The real MVP
She does in fact look like a hero. You can just tell by her eyes, she's been through/seen some shit.
Good girl
This is the best girl
Good girl! Good girl Frida!
What a good girl. 
Look at those booties!
We should save 52 street dogs in her honor.
The goggles. Possibly one of the cutest things of all time. 
i thing the name is marina
She's a good dog but hasn't saved 53 lives, only 12, and that's throughout her entire career, not just from this one Mexico earthquake.

> "According to Mexican Naval Captain, De Fragata Israel Monterde, Frida has helped to locate 53 people throughout her career¬†in various disaster zones across Mexico, Honduras, Ecuador and Haiti.¬†Of those 53, 12 were found alive." - [BBC: Meet Frida, Mexico‚Äôs hero canine who‚Äôs saved 12 lives](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/item/b71065eb-d88f-4db4-bbc0-95d885cc4886)

Very good boy

She deserves all the rubs and treats! Good girl Frida!!

Bless her heart! And everyone else that has helped and is helping!üíú praying for all those involved!üíï
Friday the marina.
And how many lives has a cat saved
Good girl :)
I imagine she's seen a fair amount of gruesome shit in the process as well.
Of course! But seriously this dog has done more than anyone on my ship lol.
This is excellent, good girl 
Who's a good girl?

Apparently she's an old sea dog.

You're the best girl, Frida.

New R6S operator leak confirmed 
Tell me about her outfit! Are those dog-specific goggles or human goggles made doggy? Does she dig people out herself - is that why she needs the shoes? Does the vest serve a purpose or is it just for easy ID?

Oh man.... I'm one of those people who sees a powerful lady and asks "who are you wearing?" 
Go get 'me, Pup!!

What an amazingly good girl! If I were trapped, and saw that sweet snout poke through the ruins to rescue me, I would be ecstatic. 
On second thought, I might think I had died and gone to heaven - where all good dogs go!!
Anyone in this thread who thinks we deserve dogs, doesn't deserve a dog.
Why is Frida wearing Marina's jacket? 
Just another day on the job
10/10 would call her a good doggo 
What a good girl!
I have always been a fan of Dogoggles.  
  
Also, I know she's a working dog and I would only barely be able to refrain from scratching her muzzle and rubbing her ears.
Someone please Tell her she's a good doggo 
Good girl Frida!!!

I head during 9/11 Steve Buscemi would hide in the over head compartment of the plane so the dogs would "rescue" him so the dogs do not get stressed or depressed when they didn't find any survivor.

Can someone make sure trump sees this. You know just some more wood for the üî• 
Aww.  She looks tired. Sad.  I'm sure she smelled 10x that many that were gone already.  I saw a show about cadaver dogs, they get really depressed
Isn't she Marina?

Who do i make the cheque out to?

You may be cool but you will never be Frida 
Frida people
Her name is MARINA pendejo
God bless Frida
So what happened to Marina, why is Frida wearing her work gear? It looks like there's more to the story. 
Don't you mean "save" as well? What does she do to actually save people?
OMG, THOSE SOCKS
I like her little shoes. 
My dog can't even find her ball cos its behind a plant pot.....but as much as I love hearing about hero dogs, I can't help but feel a bit sad that they won't ever truly understand how special they are & that not all dogs are capable of doing such an important & dangerous job. Its all in a days work for them.
The goodest of girls 
is that a? no it can't be. a

L E G E N D A R Y B O Y E ? ? ?
Quit your BS: her name‚Äôs Marina

She even has tiny dog gloves
I believe that all dogs should replace humans in all jobs. Just sayin
And my dog just frightened herself with her own fart. 
H E R O B O Y E...
That's >9000 in dog lifes
It's doggle time!
She looks sad :( As much as I admire service dogs sometimes the work they have to do is terrible and they don't get to choose. Well more accurately a good doggo does whatever makes their person happy. 
That's awesome. She's done wonderful job. 

It's time now that she be retired. That's horrifying work.
Good Girl.
Good girl, Frida!
Frida est√° trabajando duro y ha encontrado a 52 personas en edificios derrumbados.

No wonder Frida sounded familiar, according YLE 12-year-old girl, Frida, [is trapped under a collapsed school building](https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9843282)  I hope all Fridas are okay soon...
Marina also sounds like a nice name for her.
