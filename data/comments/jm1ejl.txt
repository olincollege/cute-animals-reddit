The dog is just not able to understand why his human not letting him love.
My friends weiner dog loves to lick my beard. Right now he cannot do since I'm wearing a mask so instead he will vigorously lick my eyebrows
Beagles are incredible, I miss mine
Aww god, he/she's so small.
Show me your face hooman. I want to lick your face
I‚Äôll take the risk for that cute pup
The only anti masker I‚Äôll ever tolerate
Ted?
Dog kisses should be a constitutional right!
Oh my God, he's adorable! And the puppy is cute too.
Cute, but everyone should learn from my mistakes that happened nearly the same way. Puppy scratched my right cornea doing this, so badly it almost ripped it in half, I narrowly missed requiring surgery.

Most cornea abrasions heal in 24-48hrs because that part of the body heals super quickly. It took mine over a week until I didn't have blurry vision, and 3 years later and it's still not back to as good of vision as my left eye.

Close your eyes whenever a dog is around your face with their paws.
The anti maskers are teaching their vicious dogs to attack masks!
Omg so cute
This is portuguese veterinary Andr√© Santos, you can get more eyebleach on his IG @andresantosvet.
I want to give that little anti-masker a squeezie-squeezie!

\*But how can i give you kisses if the mask is on your face?\*
You can‚Äôt fight the love, man!
Lemme in! Gotta lick that face!
Fortunately I believe they found that dogs do not spread COVID-19. No harm, no foul here now collect those face licks
Hey give me mask too doctor.
Man survives ruthless doggo attack
‚ÄúSo this bitch kept trying to take off my mask...‚Äù
Vet tech here, can confirm this is a daily occurrence.  

Upside is the mask keeps the hair out of my nose, which was the old daily occurrence.
Anyone else think he sorta looks like Ted from Schitt‚Äôs Creek?
Very smol face hugger
Hate it when an anti-mask Karen does this to me at the grocery store.

What a cute little Karen!

If all anti maskers were this cute I'll let them give me the virus
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but you have cuteness.

It's terminal.
An especially high-IQ anti-masker, even.
This is giving me cuteness aggression. I‚Äôd want to take the mask off and eat that cutest of puppers!
When we first met our dog at the shelter in the greeting room, the first thing she did was try to paw my mask off. So we each had to take our mask off for a minute so she could check our faces. And now that we've had her 10 weeks, she still shies away from people in masks when we go on walks.

Not to be dramatic but i would die for this animal 

r/ntbdbiwdfta
since when were non-maskers that cute?
My ovaries üòç our Beagle is a rescue, so it took her two years to learn to take and give love. That is the one thing we have to be grateful for in 2020: my husband was furloughed at the beginning of the year for almost two months, I‚Äôve been working from home so we‚Äôve been lucky enough to spend a lot of extra time with her, which has made a huge different in her attitude.
Has he tried putting the dog down?

Wait. I‚Äôm talking crazy. That‚Äôs impossible.
Is her name Karen?
Beagles...Good grief!
This is love
I like dogs
Soo much happiness in 14 seconds üåûüåûüåû
This is how my Freya reacts to seeing her vet every time. Only difference is she's 130 lbs of fluff and puppy energy lol
Puppies are the most inappropriate and unprofessional things in the world
Nothing cuter than a beagle pup!
The stuff these essential workers have to put up with.
We shall name this dog Karen!
He‚Äôs so cute! Mr licks!
Dogs are amazing.
My parents had to put down our 14 year old beagle last week while I have been away at school. This is exactly what I needed to see this morning
I see a dog, and I'm straight to my knees welcoming hello and kisses and slobbering and all that stuff, but I see a human and I look the other way and hope they don't talk to me.
My friend‚Äôs puppy did this to me yesterday. That little ball of energy tried to get under my mask to lick me.
Ah beagles! Truly the doggiest of dogs! (And I mean that in the best way).
If all non-maskers were that adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è some are just plain rude üòû

Anti-maskers are getting SO aggressive lately... This one seems barking mad!

This is quite literally what my dog does when in public.
That dude's got a ruff job

Literally.

I work with puppies for a living. The first thing they do when you pick them up is go for the mask lol
ost 'non-maskers' I've seen are vicious and noisy about their right to be free from a mask,not pleasant at all.  Unlike human non-makers, this pup is just adorable and deserves to be free of any mask.
Being a puppy: one of the few legitimate medical exemptions for being in public without a mask.
Could you imagine how well this gif would do as a Tinder profile clip?

I love the attempt to snuggle it into submission.
Take off that mask and give me

I work at an animal shelter now, and I can say with complete conviction that all dogs are antimaskers. They tear mine off multiple times a day, every day. And I love it. Sweet babies.
He just wants to give kisses!
This is what it‚Äôs like wearing my mask while holding my ten month old baby
Best prescription for this behavior: muchas smoochas.

This morning my cat lay beside me licked my beard for 4 minutes straight. I timed it because I was listening to a song that was 4 minutes long.
Total failure to observe any kind of social distancing, not only refusing to wear his own mask but attempting to remove someone else's while touching the other person's eyes and face.

I‚Äôve had one dog in my life and it was a beagle we adopted when she was 8 or 9. She was with us for six years, been gone for almost longer, yet I still think about her everyday. I loved that old dog.
Such a cute little beagle buddy!
I should have been vet instead of md, but then I remembered it's not all loves and kisses, couldn't bare to put a dog down.
Damn anti maskers!

Why are beagles so into licking face?
It would be so hard to resist taking of the mask and giving that dog a million kisses
Very disrespectful. He doesn't even keep 2m distance.
Karen can be dogs too?
I had one too! She used her little claws with laser like precision!
what kind if dog is that?
I won't bother, if their was a non-masker like him near me!! I would kiss him!

I was working with a little boy and he would pull hair/ hit when he didn‚Äôt want to do work. Once that didnt work with me he started ripping off my mask (and glasses!) or better yet snapping it on my face. I was trying to get him used to wearing a mask during sessions too so he could go back to school. He kept it on for a record of 4 minutes once. Lovable little anti masker
Fun fact: Covid came from animals
