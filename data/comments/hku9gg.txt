Because your shoes stink the most like you
My dog does it all the time with my slippers when I go out.  If I‚Äôm out for too long he might go and get the other slipper too.  When I come home I find her sleeping with one or two slippers.
That broke my heart a bit!  Needs a friend, I think.  So lonely for daddy...
Dear diary, 

my dearest human has once again vanished without a trace. All i have left to remember them by is a shoe, which i have taken to the couch to sleep with and remember them...
I don't think I could go to work after seeing that.
Had a dog that would curl up in the laundry basket with dirty clothes, which would have been fine but she was a Rottie. Blew out the sides of so many baskets...
That's it. I'm never leaving my dog alone again.
That's enough to make a grown man cry ...... And that's okay
Video broke my heart. Title broke my brain.
That was painful to read
Awwwwwwww!!! We don‚Äôt deserve dogs I swear!
God I wish my dog did this and not ‚Äúmom will love the new aeration holes in her new runners she accidentally left out while going to work to pay for my absolutely adorable ass who is worth it‚Äù which she is.... or so I tell myself.

This is why I say all pets need a sibling. When I rescued my cat Ashi off the streets and went to work he would cry at the door for a solid half hour. Once we rescued another cat he has stopped. Now he can play and cuddle with someone as only another cat can. The get along great!
Dogs are the best!
This makes me super sad knowing that I'm currently on a three week trip away from my dogs
My heart!
Must not chew. Must not chew... mmm.
Awwww his face looks so sad  üò•
This is both uplifting and heartbreaking at the same time. What a good boy.
Nah he just loves feet stank.
That‚Äôs just like my cat!  When ‚Äôm out, my cat shits all over my clothes.

My dog does this with my dirty laundry. I kept coming home to find dirty laundry in my front hall, right by the front door. Set up a camera and found out that within minutes of my leaving the house for the day, my dog was picking an item out of the laundry hamper and carrying it to the door, where she'd sleep with it.

Cute, but r/titlegore
That title gave me a headache.
First, I want to saw daww.  
Second, I want to say, it looks like English might not be your first language. I completely understood you, which is why I think you did a great job, but in case you want to learn more English:  
"**This surveillance camera catch the moment a dog took his owner shoe and sleep beside this showing how much he miss his owner meanwhile he was at work"**

Is more grammatically correct as:  
**"This surveillance camera caught the moment a dog took his owner's shoe to sleep with, showing how much he missed his owner while he was at work."**  
And could be better phrased as:  
**"While his owner was at work, this dog was caught on camera taking a shoe to sleep with, showing how much he missed him."**

The hardest aspect isn't the verb tenses (catch vs caught, miss vs missed), but actually the number of clauses in the sentence, and the overuse of pronouns. When you say "he missed his owner while he was at work" it becomes ambiguous if the owner or the dog is at work. (common sense is why everyone can read this).  


Again, I don't mean any insult, and disregard if you're not interested.
Did I have a stroke reading that?
Working a double tomorrow. Abandonment guilt building..
We don't deserve dogs man
That dog is a sweetheart!
So, what does it mean when a cat is constantly using your clothes as a litter box but no others. My aunt has a friend that stays with her, and her cat is constantly doing this to only his things.
My sister‚Äôs in law dog? Is that how you say my wife‚Äôs sister‚Äôs dog? How does that work. Anyway. RILEY does this with said owner‚Äôs socks and oh boy it‚Äôs super cute but not as cute is this.
We have a seven year old pup that does this too. It's pretty cute, until you're late for work trying to find your other shoe....
quit your job rn. go home.
Get an animal that lives in packs. Be all the animal knows. Leave him hours on end alone. "Oh so cute, the dog misses all he knows in his solitary confinement. Such love. Much cuteness".

Beautiful video, but r/titlegore.
My friend's dog will always bring a shoe from the hallway as a gift whenever people come to visit, it's very sweet!
I‚Äôll always wear the same sweatshirt to bed the week before a work trip to leave for my dog to cuddle while I am gone. The pictures of him snuggled into it are always so heartbreaking.
One more example of why we don‚Äôt deserve dogs.
What the camera didn‚Äôt catch is the dog‚Äôs secret life of being a breakdancer..
Poor guy is lonely
üò© why doesn‚Äôt anyone love me like this
I used to leave my underwear for my pup to feel comfortable while I was at work. Eventually I realized that it's just not fair to leave a little guy alone for 8-10 hours a day so I forked up the cash for a dog walker to come by the apartment and take him for nice walk in the afternoon everyday. She was awesome and she would just take him with her while she walked all her other dogs too so he ended up making a ton of friends and getting to hang out with ppl and dogs all day while I was at work. Then he got more walkies with me after work.

I have said it before. We do not deserve dogs.
Our boy [Foggy](https://i.imgur.com/xg5E2gg.jpg) (1.5 years old Staffy mix) walks around with my wifes socks from the laundry. Doesn't harm them in any way, just a comfort thing for him.
You need to quit and go home right now!

Man...if I could I would take my pups to work with me.  Then we could hang out all the time...
My dog does this! We call him a shoe dragon. You can tell what parent he‚Äôs loving more based on the number of shoes in the bed that day. He also uses it to learn about visitors. So if someone sleeps over, he‚Äôll steal their shoes to get to know them overnight.
My dog does this with all shoes - whenever we have guests we inevitably find ourselves running around the house looking for a shoe that she ran off with
Is this why our cat likes to lay on top our shoes??
i would quit my job.
Don't let him fool you with that sad act. He saving a snack for later.
My dog would have just eaten the shoe.
Maybe the dog is inhaling another dog turd that the owner stepped on during one of their walk?
My dog does the same thing with my shoe when I go upstairs. Like, bruh... Just come to my bedroom.

I used to find my socks in my dog‚Äôs bed and I thought it was kind of sweet that he wanted to sleep with something that had my scent on it. Then I found a new Swiffer pad in his bed and realized he was just weird.
This is so sad!
That chonker really had to think about hopping up on the couch.
What did we do to deserve dogs ?
Humans don't deserve dogs.
/r/titlegore
Because dogs track time until you come back by how much your scent fades.   It's why dogs can anticipate when someone's coming home.

In this doggo's mind, this makes it seem like you're still there.
My dog would have destroyed the shoe to *teach* me a lesson for leaving him. ASK ME _HOW_ I KNOW.
Oh my heart.

Too many feels. Omg. Baby girl misses her papa.

When we got a new bed a few years back, we discovered a literal nest of our ‚Äúmissing‚Äù clothing. The dog had been dragging it under the bed to sleep with, it was a semi-circle with a Labrador-size crevice in the middle.

Omg,......I love dogs....and my puppy loves me.
My poodle acts like every time we step out even for 15 minutes its like we've been gone an eternity and she has a hopping skipping reaction each time we come back. My other older boy loves to sleep in a nest of our clothes. If he doesn't have any he finds them from the laundry and puts it in his bed..

My old dog use to do that with all my shoes. Never tore them up but they'd all be on the couch when i got home.
and my cat won't even acknowledge my existence most days...
Both my pitties do this, and it melts my heart.
Of course it is a pit. Best dogs to ever walk the earth.
My mom did this with her first dog. She had an old shoe that she always took with her when she went out with the dog. When she couldn‚Äôt take the dog she would leave the shoe with him. He knew she would come back for the shoe so he would wait for her.
No way that house hippo was going to for sure snack on that shoe later

Don't want to shame anyone here as I don't know the situation with this video. Inconvenient truth, however, if you live alone and are gone regularly for more than 10 hours a day with your large dog locked inside, they're not living their best life. Doggie daycare for the win in cases like this.

Is this why people are compelled to take their pets to the store and literally everywhere else with them?
It's ok buddy, they'll be home soon!
When my dog was a small puppy (like fit in your palm small) he would sleep on my shoes, or next to them with his little head inside while I was at work 

(Dont worry GF was Home with home when he was puppy)
Pitbulls are the best
Worst part is, dogs don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre leaving to the grocery store or leaving overseas for a long trip. They don‚Äôt know when you‚Äôll be back
Can anyone say me the race of the dog?
Had a Doberman Shepherd mix who would curl up directly in the laundry basket while we were at work. Don‚Äôt know how he made himself fit, but he was like that virtually every day we would get home.
Reminds me when I came home to my puppy doing this :'(

Well, dogs do live life seven times faster, so if his owner was at work for 10 hours, that would be almost 3 days to the dog
This is the best thing I've ever seen.
Jeezus, get him a fucking kitten.
My pittie loves sleeping in my dirty clothes pile.  Whenever I can't find him, that's where he is.
Aaand this is why my sister and I switched to only owning cats from now on. Our poor doggie is like this (and worse, he has bad separation anxiety) and we just can't take it, it tears our heart up, and we can't put another dog through it. Our cats on the other hand sleep peacefully and barely notice when we come home but still provide loving cuddles when we settle down.

Please don't get a dog if you work long hours and someone isn't home for them.
That shoe stinks probably more than this title

I grew up with a Black Labrador Retriever who would steal underwear from the laundry room, take it to her bed, and sleep with it while we were away.

I mean ewww, but also, awwww.

My dog does this constantly. Doesn‚Äôt chew on my shoes, just hoards them on the couch or bed.
I would tell my manager there's a family emergency no time to explain I'm going home
Man.. I think I would quit my job just so my dog doesn't feel alone if she does this.. thankfully she just destroys them so we good.
My dog loved my sandals and slippers! I miss you my Rosie girl

Our Jack did this everyday.. we'd come home to 4 or 5 shoes on the sofa, man I miss that boy.

This is adorable! All my cat does is yell at me like I should of never left in the first place.

Oh wow, this brings me back. I had a dog growing up that slept on a old lazy boy recliner. Every night she would grab a fresh shoe from the front hall to sleep with. Even if the shoe from the previous night was still there, she grabbed a new one.
Gotta get the puppy a buddy.  Always best to get them in pairs, that way they always have someone.
Such unconditional love.   What we all yearn for but so few find (from other humans).  That‚Äôs why dogs are the best.

My Maine Coon cat sleeps on my dirty laundry when I'm not home (and sometimes even when I am home).  The smellier the better so I leave my 'yardwork' clothes on the floor next to the laundry basket so that he'll have somewhere to lay.
Aww little buddy. What a sweet peach.
My dog used to do this! Except I didn't have a camera so I'd come home to find my shoe in random places.
Aww so cute! One of our kitties puts her toys in our shoes by the door when we're out. Or sometimes I would find them in my work bag.
Wait, is that why one of my shoes was always missing, moved halfway across the house, but never actually chewed up?
Why u got 2 due dis OP
A shoe is all my mans had to go off of
Man, I hate the bad rep pit bulls (and similar breeds) have gotten. Raised right, they're some of the sweetest and loving puppers out there.

Over christmas, we had to leave our dog in the garage at my partner's sister's house and every morning we would come in, one of my shoes and one of my partners shoes was in his bed.
Stinky in the most bestest way. SNERRGHH. Heavy sigh. I love you and all your shoes . ‚Ä¢ sighs in dog‚Ä¢
If I leave my shoes out I‚Äôll always come home to one or both scattered in my house but never chewed up. I wonder if my boys do this too

Hello, boss? Yes I cant come in today on account of my dog is heartbroken without me. You understand of course

This reminds me of Seymour. Such a good boy.
One of my cats goes for my used shirts at the pits when when I'm right there.

I will never not upvote this! Melts my heart
He just sees a toy.. his thinking is too limited for him to hold an object belonging to his owner and hug it while waiting for him, although there are some relatively smart dogs but most of the time owners just over-analyse and overreact because it sounds more aww, boo me all you want but humans like to think of their animals as children who understand their words but they simply don't, try saying how much you love it loudly with an aggressive tone and it will look "guilty" as you like to think, tell it it's a disgusting piece of shit in a calm friendly tone while giving it rubs and it will shake the tail and put it's tongue out.
My dog will sleep with her nose inside my shoe for some reason.
I set up cameras inside (prior to installing outside) to see my dog‚Äôs routine - I was glad to see he was his normal, happy self. And a buy resentful that I was stuck at work and he was living it up. 

Jump back in my bed after I leave for a long nap. Walk the house and survey out the windows. Check on his brother in his crate. Nap on the couch. Then another couch. Bark out the window for a bit. Nap on another couch. Have a snack. Check on brother. Find a sunny spot for another nap. Wake up and come greet me when he hears the garage open
GET YO ASS BACK HOME, MY G

This pup got up on the couch like mine does! It always makes me giggle. What a sweet dog.
The thought of what my cat did all day used to sadden me, since he is always at the door meowing at me like crazy when I get home. 

Then I quarantined for 3 months. I knew cats slept 18 hours a day. I never knew what that really looked like.
My dog does this with my shirts to a point that I make sure there is one out for him to "find"

Dogs don't know the difference between weekends and week days.  They just know that some day you love them and some days you hate them.

My pitbull takes his favorite blanket from the living room, takes it to the bedroom and sleeps on my side of the bed. 

When I open the door he runs out still tangled in the blanket and when I go in the bedroom my side of the bed is all warm and it really crushes my heart

He's the sweetest dog I've ever met in my life.
Our dog does this too. She is very attached to my father, and whenever he goes to market, she sleeps on the top of his slippers, even if he goes out for just 5-10 min. Dogs really are the most amazing ones.
I had a pitty that would steal one shoe as soon as I walked in the door, and hide it. He thought if he took one shoe I couldn't leave, not knowing I had 347 pairs of shoes!!! I miss Vito‚ù§Ô∏è
Arrgh! My heart broke!
If my dog show this kind of love ever.. he probably be waking up with some water droplets on his face.

If you're going to regularly be away from a dog then you should at least have a second one so they don't get lonely like this.
Aaaand I'm crying. Thanks.
She looks like she is still nursing, or has been recently. Her pups were probably taken away, for many reasons that could run from vet check to sold them, so she is bonding with a shoe. My dog use to bond with a rubber strawberry that GOD HELP you if you ever squeaked it. She'd act like you were killing her babies. She was never bred....lol
What kind of dog is that? Looks huge but docile.
aweee  :)) our dog does this too
How much we underestimate animals and dont respect and give them credit. Thankfully now the owner can understand this and love this critter instead of being angry at why his shoe is on the couch. Very sweet

Cute video and all... But I think I had a stroke reading that.
That title is horrendous. It's like explaining open a joke in a post that doesn't even include a joke. Or was it perhaps for the blind?
Jfc what is that title? What a rollercoaster ride!
Had to comment the count was 666
my dog uses my shoe so he doesn't bite me or people who come to my house because he can't hold his excitement in and he doesn't want to bite
This is why I don‚Äôt want a dog. Unless I work from home or I am retired I don‚Äôt want a dog.
We need to learn from dogs and be about the love
Dogs are wolves with Williams syndrome.
This is definitely a female, pregnant dog though right???
The dog needs the biggest of hugs!!
Who‚Äôs a good girl? You are!
Covid-19 is a blessing for pets
My dog does that all the time I‚Äôm not home
My dogs do this
I would never be able to go to work again after seeing this üò≠
My dogs literally sleep on the shoes out by the door.
This is why I am so torn between having a dog and not having one. Sometimes I think we don't deserve them.
An ‚Äúaww‚Äù moment, but that is a lot of hours for a creature with so much love to give to be alone...
I don‚Äôt even have a dog and I wanna go home and hug my dog. My cat will suffice. Til she scratches me in the face again.
Must be a shoe from Shoe-la-la.
So sweet
Very sweet.
Meanwhile at work.
this is why you should have 2 dogs   - to keep each other company
Everybody liked that
I feel my heart crack...
My best friends dog does this lmao
Dogs are so needy
I so happy
I was having a good day.  
We were ALL having a good day.  
WHY ARE YOU LIKE THIS?!?
We've caught our dog doing this. He likes to use our shoes as pillows, and loves laying in the dirty laundry. He'll even spread it out to make a bed.
Poor sweet pup. My dog just started doing the same thing, I think she's gotten too used to me being home because of covid üò≠ guess I'm never leaving my house again without her.
Such sad üò≠
r/titlegore
I hope his human didn‚Äôt get mad when he came home and found his shoe on the couch. Your dog was missing you, is all.
My dog will always gravitate towards any clothes I may have on the floor and insist on sleeping on it.
To us, they're just a small part of our lives. To them, we are their whole lives. A dog's unconditional love for their owner is not to be underestimated
good boy! Getting on the couch was a struggle though! LOL
This video show a pers take a video they find online and who‚Äôre to karma it
My heart
This is almost what my cat does. She sleeps on our shoes if we come home and don't put them in the show closet right away. I think she thinks if she is laying on them, we can't leave home. xD
ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
Now sure which is cuter: the broken English relating the universally of value placed on love for creatures not even in our gene pool (defying our "evolutionary imperative") or the video itself.
My Golden did this notoriously. She died in November, but this gave me a happy memory! 

You couldn‚Äôt take your shoes off briefly without one of them going missing. We called her ‚Äúthe Shoe Dragon‚Äù and she took all the shoes behind the coach in a nest. She snuck in like to steal the shoes- and it actually worked.
Wholesome 100
Proof that dogs are better than people
After several passes I think I understand. But now I have a headache
Probly smells of dog shit! :)
My rescue dog did that one time the first or second  week that  I brought her home. Then she stopped doing it. I hope that means she knows I'll always come home, and not because she doesn't miss me anymore! Haha
Dogs are such loving gentle creatures, we don‚Äôt deserve them
We. Don't. Deserve. Dogs.
I'm sorry but I did not subscribe to this sub so that I could cry
This is so beautiful
I hope the dog can go outside while his owner is gone.
 Something wrong with this video its all watery
Bet he tore it up a couple seconds later...
He obviously loves chewing shoes and loves sleeping with his chew toys.

Source: am dog
Awww
This is why I have unlimited internet allowance so I can put music or videos on for my pets
Or he just wanted to protect his new chew toy.
We had a dog that raided trash cans for used feminine hygiene products to ferociously munch on.
They carried it so gingerly by the laces... My heart...
This is vital in why you must do 2 things for your dog when away.

1) Reduce General Separation Anxiety

2) Have sources of enrichment to fight boredom and keep mental stimulation


Your unscathed furniture will thank you.
Dogs dont deserve us..
This is what love is
Good chonk
Whens the lats time you aaw argentium?
Needed a sun blocker for his favorite spot on couch.
This title requires a translation from invalid to person.
Dogs are better than people
What did we do to deserve them!!
That‚Äôs so sad. If I get a pet I‚Äôm going to get them a friend too.
We don‚Äôt deserve them
*I luff you.  Where did you go?*
Nah it's a pitt, he ate the owner and that's his trophy.
My dog does this while I am at home ü§£
Super frustrating always looking for one shoe
What the fuck is this title lmao
I need to get a surveillance cam because my pupper will take whatever smells the most like me and chews the shit out of it too!
That made my day,thanks
This is the most poorly written fucking title. Jesus christ..
Godzilla tried to read this post and he fuckin died
tell me why I thought this said something about dog taking his own life before I saw the r/aww title
What a sweet velvet hippo
I can feel my heart crack
First Time I ever said aww to one of these posts
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying.
Pleeeease can I get a r/MasterReturns with this dog so my heart can be whole again
aww
I can‚Äôt take it
Wow my dog do the same thing üòÜ so cool
we don't deserve dogs.
Man my fucken heart
‚ÄúIma chew this up if he ain‚Äôt back by 5‚Äù
This so sad.
And cute.

"I feel my heart crack"
Once I came home and my dog was wearing a pair of my underwear...
Omg this is too cute love it
Or he just likes the damn shoe.
My cat cuddles with my sandals even when I'm in the room. She's weird.
Hard to tell in the video, but if it's a female, she might suffer from false pregnancy :/
I have shoes like this that my dog carries around
My parent's cat does this, she sleeps on their "spots" on the couch when they are both out of the house
This is really cute but it breaks mah heart!
THIS SHIT GOT ARGENTIUM
I wish that less people were allergic to dogs and cats.

That way we could bring them to some work places.

They‚Äôre really like family honestly. This just shows even more evidence of that.
WE SO DO NOT DESERVE DOGS. OMG.
Its enough to make a grown man cry
I know women like this. I'm missing a couple hoodies.
If you ask me, the dog looks like he is using it to block the sun on his eyes. The sun light coming off the windows.
So precious...
Dude... learn to write, or ask for help
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ OH MY GOSH!!!
His so sad! He needs a pet!
My dog used to fill his bed with our shoes. The smellier trainers the better. And rollerblades too.
Dogs are too good for us
That grammar ‡≤†\_‡≤†
Welp, it‚Äôs final. We all have to work from home for the rest of our lives. Easy fix.
‚ÄúCamera caught the moment a dog got his owner‚Äôs shoe to sleep beside while he missed his owner at work.‚Äù
That dog is overfed.
We frequently will find a specific pair of my husband's shorts in our dog's bed. He doesn't chew it up, just sleeps with it. It's  really sweet.
Holy heckers that's got me right in the feels.
Quarantine must have been a blessing for him!
So cute
That‚Äôs not aww, that‚Äôs plain sad...
Well done karmabot.
This is the first r/aww post that made me actually go aww!

14d old account 22k karma; something's afoot!
OKAY I CRY
My dog must *really* love me if he‚Äôs eating all my shoes
...or he's getting ready to chew it later.
No, this is [69 year old Hugo](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/hion5y/comment/fwihdpi)
It's enough to make a grown man cry...

... And thats okay!
Snacc time
My dog do the same thing but with my tshirt
This reminds me of my cat. She wont sleep unless she has something that has our scent on it. We usually give her a shirt after we have worn it. But with covid now and the risk of infecting her one of us will have a shower, wear a shirt for an hour then give it to her if she doesnt already have one by her to sleep with.
I would quit my job the minute I saw that footage.
Defending? I'm not defending anything.
My pittie loves to pile my shoes on my bed when I am at work. When I come home he will be all cracked out with his face stuffed in a boot sleeping in some awkward position looking like he just won the lottery.
My situation is the opposite, my girl has passed some days ago and I curl up in her bed and I try to comfort myself with her scent üò¢ The world has gotten empty and lifeless
Could it be possible that dogs chewing shoes is then actually a sign of affection?
i cri
My dog does the same but with a T-Shirt on my bed. She lays on it
Ninjas are cutting onions again
I can feel my heart cracks
Awww. We don't deserve the.
‚ù§
I'm sitting alone at work on an 11 hour shift and my dog is alone at home. Now I want to cry...
Luckily for me nerve damage meant I had to stop working now I spend all by time with my dog
My dog does the same thing
Not my dog
Chew the fuck out of it
My ex‚Äôs dog used to do this with my shoes. That dog was the cutest.
My WIFE wouldn‚Äôt even do this.

(But that I get.)

When your parents say you cant have a dog and you can easily take over and make them buy a dog but u decide to wait so you can have the dog all to yourself.   
Oh yeah this is big brain time
NOW I understand what my cat is doing!
Ow. My Heart
Jesus Christ this title
What language is this, chinese-karma-farmerian?
More like: "Camera captures moment when dog realizes owner can't yell at him for taking his shoe while he is at work- and rests with said trophy until his owner's return."

xD
My heart...
I quit my job if I see this shit
We need a 20 hour work week.  
Video says it all.
This means u gott quit your job and be with this dog all day everyday..
Oh That's so sad.
He likes to chew the shoe
Thanks, I can never leave my dog home alone now.
One of the reasons I'll never get a dog. No living thing should ever feel that much love for me.
Dog's gotta take it easy with those sneakers, they're not easy to come by anymore...
Time to cry
My dog does this, only he takes the insoles out before he sleeps with the shoes!
If my dog chews up the shoe instead, what‚Äôs that mean?
I had a dog that would sleep on my shoes. Then she got older and decided the pillow was much nicer.
Do not fall for this! It makes your wife think you just kick your shoes off all over the place
This may have been written already but i read something the other day that really hit me so Im going to share it again. Someone said that dogs eat their owners shoes because it it is the last thing they see their owners put on before they leave the house. Eat the shoe, stop the the owners from leaving -  i mean it s pretty solid tactic.
we don't deserve dogs
üò≠my poor heartüíî
e . I  I a good night to ya yw a know ya ya damn
r/titlegore
Our first family dog, a mutt, got into my wife's closet and destroyed every left foot high heel shoe. About 20 shoes, leaving her with none.  Fortunately she had just quit the bank job and was working in manufacturing so no need for heels, so he lived.  He would drag out a piece of cord wood and chew it to slivers in a day. 

Our current dog, a cute little Boston loves to drag my underwear out of the bedroom and gnaw on them in the front room. Never chews anything that isn't his.
I cry
Terrible day for rain
Something about this use of ‚Äúmoment‚Äù bugs me
time to quit your job
he would love my climbing shoes, which i wear without socks
Hachiko

Awww... my dog does this too
So adorable
*This surveillance camera catches the moment a dog takes his owner‚Äôs shoe and sleeps beside it, showing how much he misses him while he is at work. 

You‚Äôre welcome.
My heart just broke a bit
My cat lays on my shoes every day when i come home and take them off
What this doesn't show is that he proceeds to chew and tear apart that poor shoe
This is adorable.
Dogs need a companion. Get two dogs at least.
Dogs are amazing
Even my Husband never did anything as sweet!
my dog used to take out all of my cloths out of the closet trying to find me while i was at work xD
My heart :)
I'm Not crying You Are!!
i work at a doggy daycare and boarding facility and we have this dog come in sometimes who has an owner belonging item that's a single shoe. i asked one of our managers one time why he has a shoe in his kennel and she told me that it was his owner's who passed away about a year ago

Oh God this is so relatable for me when I miss someone.. I always try to find something of theirs and hold it close ..

Exhibit 9,876 why dogs are the best.
The moment I see this headline I made my head hurt because there's no punctuation meanwhile I'm drinking a vitamin water i like vitamin water the pomegranate one is my favorite hi reddit.
Big pitbulls really are the sweetest dogs
Pitbulls that are sad for temporary reasons are the most adorable thing on the planet
People need to buy 2 dogs or else it‚Äôs just cruel. I get it if you have a housewife or kids, but this shouldn‚Äôt be allowed. This is what this poor dog deals with everyday. His owner is his world. People are losing their minds staying home in quarantine and this poor dog has to stay home alone and doesn‚Äôt have anything to do
Wtf is this title 

Get to the point and use better grammar
We don't deserve dogs. Period. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go remind my dog that he is the best boy...
Doggos are MANKIND‚Äôs Best Friends
We don't deserve dogs.
God damned onion ninjas
How did we deserve dogs?!
This isn‚Äôt my dog and I decided to quit my job or anything that represents leaving this doggo alone
