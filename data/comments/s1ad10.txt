He’s so tiny but so determined!
With his coloring, from a distance he looks like some really tiny lamb. Those sheep must be like : Why is this fetus unsupervised?
Those old ladies checking in on the pup! 

“You alright Darlin’? You keep on coming sweetheart!”
At this age, it probably thinks it is a sheep
Awwwwwdorable
I live in a village that over the winter has goats and sheep wile during summer they are on top of the mountain. The shepperts have Silas since we have to many wolfs around so I got used to have those awesome beasts around. This autumn they all come back and they had 4 puppies. God damm, they are so incredible cute and soooo fluffy!!!! But you can't touch them since they should not be used to be with humans.

Great dogs though!
We protec you now, you protec us later. Beautiful!
So cute, I had to watch it several times. 😍
I'm imagining the puppy whispering to the sheep "Move on please, my owner needs to see I'm doing a good job!"
I remember seeing a video of a bloodied dog who had just fought some wolves to protect the sheep, and the sheep were lining up to boop heads with the dog to show respect and I think they are doing the same to this little puppy.

Edit: was wrong, its a picture: https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fxklaud0e4sb21.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fpics%2Fcomments%2Faia54p%2Fsheep_shows_gratitude_to_the_dog_after_saving%2F&docid=KeBb751wK4bF-M&tbnid=3Xkr5GQp241IOM&vet=1&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim
Fun fact: the Anatolian Shepherd is not actually a sheep-herding breed. It's a livestock guardian breed. Herding dogs tend to form a very different type of bond with the livestock. Sheep herding taps into the dog's predatory instincts, whereas LGDs ideally experience none of that predatory behavior toward the livestock. Herders tend not to live with the flock, whereas LGDs do. Our goats absolutely lose their shit when we take our LGDs away from them, like when they go to the vet or out for a special training session. Have you ever heard a goat scream? It's freaky. And they scream until they have their dogs back.
"Baa, ram ewe!" The secret password.
Omg.. The sheep checking in on the pup: "You're doing such a wonderful job Billy! Keep it up! We're so proud of you!"
I like  the sheep coming up to the puppy as thought they are saying, "Who's a good shepherd, that's right you're a good shepherd."
Promote him.  He's ready.
Hello Sam Hello Ralph
/r/dogswithjobs
So small and seriously ☺️
I love how they are all concerned thinking it’s a lost lamb.
That is so adorable I'm gonna lose my mind
Reported for child labor /s
This is **the** cutest fucking thing I have ever seen in my entire life.
Who is this kid?  Ah shit, it's the bosses kid!
One of them was definitely like "baby who is your people? You too tiny to be out here by yourself. Come on and stay by me til we find your mama nem"
Good boi and good fluffos giving him a checkup
He’s doing his best
It’s like the guy who shows up to run the plant on his first day out of college.  Everybody kinda has to chip in to keep the new boss up to speed lol.
Anatolian Shepherds or Sivas Kangalı as we call. It has one of the most powerful bites in the world. Also it's very big. When standing it's well over 170cm, close to 200cm or even taller! It can't run fast but it can run for a very long time. That's why it's good at catching wolfs which can run fast but for a short time.
Too cute! I want to cuddle the serious puppy
Sheep#1: Have you met the new Lieutenant?

Sheep#2: Sure. He's young, but he'll grow into his job. He's not baaaaaaaaad.
“That’s right!  Keep it movin’ get in line!”

Sheep:  “oh look at this cute puppet!”

“Hey, what?  Stop sniffing me I’m not cute I’m authoritative?”

Sheep:  of course you are dear my mistake. Oh no!  The big sheepdog is cross with me!  I Bette get back in line!  Hehe. “

“*tailwag* yeah!  You better!  I’m a big dog!”
“You are meant to herd us little one”
Beautiful pup
Aww my god it’s friends with the sheep! :o
He's doing such a good job!
The little one is giving instructions, at this age. Impressive.
So ADORABLE!!! Makes me think of Babe! "Bah, Ram, Ewe!"
🐑 🐑 🐑🐖
"Oh hi!... Hi!... Good morning!"
Having seen personally sheep dogs in training from very young ages, sheep love their dogs. I almost don't think they are as scared of them as they would lead on.
He mlem. He blep. He protec da shep.
The sheep with the red thing was like " yoyoyo what's that little sheep there lemme checks quick"
Cuteness to the max
"Please stop sniffing me we have to keep going!"
I would pay any amount of money to have sound for this
When you have 10 years more experience than your supervisor
Sooo cute ☺🥰🧡
I had a border collie that would go with me to bring the horses in. She would always run in front of them. 
It worked, I guess she felt leading was best! Sweet dog
I have a serious question that never occurred to me until seeing this video! I know most herding animals and farm dogs grow up like this on the farm to get used to it, but how do you guys protect against parvo in these situations?
“you the new one, honey? we’ll take care of you before you can take care of us all”
It looks like they're all saying Hi to the new rookie :)
I like how the one lamb sniffs his butt and is like "fuck this, I'm out."
He looks very proud to be helping
So, you are new guy on the job? Welcome aboard.
Even sheep want to boop the snoot.

Every person and animal loves a cute pupper.
BAA-Ram-Ewe!!!
So cute!
Do all animals despite species, sniff each other’s ass instinctively?
That last ewe was bloody on the neck? I’m surprised the ewes don’t head butt the puppy, mine will do that here when we are training a new Large Guard Dog puppy. They can be tough on the the little ones.
EDIT: Dyslexia kicked in and thought it read 'Australian Shepherd'   
There is an Australian Shepherd near me and they seem like great dogs. Look really similar to border collies. If you have met a Border Collie, they are like machines. Not particularly social with other dogs. Not unsocial, they just get more pleasure off human interaction. They need constant ball throwing, agility, tricks. They were bred to work. I threw a stick for a border collie  for an hour with my goal to get her tired or bored, didn't happen, kept going.The Australian shepherded I know, however. Super chill, loves to play with other dogs, bounce around, get fuss off strangers. Very different dog socially, Not young either, about 6 years old. Quite a cool breed, must say.
Look at that tiny tale!
"We frens!"
Pups got the spirit and the gals are checking on em but this is a tall order for the little love
“Guys please it’s my first day, move along. Move along.”
Everybody loves a puppy
the sheep so kind and gentle
Sheep are like, “Hey little buddy, keep up.” Couldn’t be any cuter!
My family breeds Anatolian Shepherd and Pyrenese mixes. They really are great Livestock Guard Dogs.
this reminds me of when I got my first job with people who depended on me
The sheep like 'oh you must be Rusty's boy! Doreen, come say hi, this is Rusty's youngest!'
Someone must have told this guy the secret sheep code.
The sheeps are like “is that my little baby shepp?” Sniff “nope that’s a dog time to go”.
All them wolves is cruel to sheep!
So adorable! My grandmother has one too, but for goats!
"Ba Ram You."

\-puppy
Omg I thought that was a cute baby sheep
“Who’s a sweet little puppy?”

The sheep, probably.
Shout out to those sheep making sure the new guy's first day is going alright.
Who’s training him? The sheep?
Baa-ram-ewe! Baa-ram-ewe! To your breed, your fleece, your clan be true! Sheep be true! Baa-ram-ewe.
He’s got a job to do, damnit
All the sheep encouraging him. "Good now gentle nip to get us moving again. Good! Make sure doris doesn't slow down. You know what's shes like in the mornings."
Ok stop it. Too cute! His strut  has confidence and when they sniff him he wiggles that tail like be nice I'm just a little guy still!
‘First day on the job mate?’ ‘Yea, just getting my feet wet’ ‘Oye boys - fresh meat over here!’ ‘Ahh blimey - thanks mate! Hey.. hey.. pleasure to meet ya..’
This seems more like a Livestock Guardian Dog, and not a herding dog. LGDs are trained so that the flock is comfortable around them, whereas herding dogs are trained to be seen as a predator. One protects the herd from things like coyotes and the other is used to direct the herd
Warms your heart.
Reminds me of babe. That movie is fucking heartbreaking to watch as an adult.
Now listen in there's a new boss in town and It is I I'm here to guard you so have no fear the big  boy is here
This is Disney movie! I really did Awww!
Who's training who?
So tiny for a dog that’s gonna get so big!
Lol- any sheep missing a baby???
Response- baaah baaah!!!!!
🤣😂
We need an update.
Who’s kid is this?🤔
Baa-ram-ewe
"So you the new guy, huh? Welcome to the herd, I’m Baaaartholomew!"
“Keep moving citizen, I’m the law around these parts”.
every sheep went up to him to say hi doggo in training
Its a good doggie
They later on become [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangal_Shepherd_Dog#/media/File%3AKangal_front_on.jpg)
Puppy “Excuse me miss, but I’ve been instructed to keep you in the line so please return to the others and continue in an orderly fashion.”
So adorable! So tiny (for now).
Is this how the relationship they build with the sheep are formed?
“Wtf is it?”
“Oh crap it’s our new boss!”
it looks like a baby sheep haha so cute
Aww how cute. Our Anatolian just died a couple weeks ago, and this video just warms my heart. He was such a good friend and guard dog.
It's like when the boss brings their adorable child to work and you keep getting distracted because they're cute and well-behaved.
God I needed to see this
"Would I rather be feared or loved? Easy - both. I want people to be afraid of how much they love me"
Slapped me with love this did
Who’s herding who?
No child left behindddd
When your boss hires his kid into a management position…
You will respect my authority
I have simply passed away from the overwhelming amount of preciousness.
Dog was whispering  baa ram youuuuu
He's doing a great job 😍
Too adorable!! Smol pupper!
this is one of the cutest things I've ever seen
"Mr. Sheep, can you please keep moving forward?"
“Hey wait! Bbaaa rraammm eewweee.”
he’s learning
I think he’s doing great
Turkish kangal puppy?
They keep checking on him. That's the cutest thing I'll see today so I'm done with the internet until tomorrow.
That's child labor bro
We are sheep and Dog is our shepherd
-Canus Lupus 1:1
They’re like, oh you must be the new guy, welcome buddy just pay attention to your supervisor and you’ll be just fine
I love how enthralled the sheep are with him
“excuse me sir but please keep moving “
such a good boy!!! and all the sheep are helping him along :)
The sheep are so encouraging lmao
Why is the shepherd posting videos on reddit instead of working. Where is his boss?  🤔
First time I actually want sound with a video.
This might be the cutest thing I've ever seen.
I remember when my girl was that smol. She would go outside and plop herself down right in the middle of the horse or goat pasture.
OMG the little nuzzles.
HE DO BE GUARDIN THE LIVESTOCK. 

GOOD PUP.
Puppy is like ...yeah yeah, keep moving pal. LOL
They are literally just humoring him and I love it.
He’s doing a good job
dont be fooled by the smol, the Kangals are close to wolves in sizes
Each one says, "Come on little one, you got to keep up".
I'm seeing some sucking up to the little guy. Trying to get on his good side.
When the herd protects you, you grow up to protect the herd.
Becoming part of the flock is a huge part of becoming a successful herd guardian.
Who’s the new supervisor?
Oh, my heart. “Hello, what are you, little thing?”
We had an Anatolian shepherd, she looked just like this when she was a puppy and she was such a good pup. She passed away a couple years back from cancer but she was one of the best dogs my family ever had
So little to start working already.
“No don’t lick us, chase us this way! come on!”
Prodigy ❤️
“Woooooolf!”
🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 He’s working so hard.
Bah-ram-yoo!
My dog is mainly Australian shepherd, with a few other breeds mixed in there. He has a very curly tail that has mystified me and everyone else. It curls once over his back and he has control over it (aka can straighten it out when he wants). Well, turns out he is 11% Anatolian shepherd and now I know where that tail comes from. 😍
That’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my life
Hearding by cuteness.
Oh man, this was sweet, very sweet. Reminded me of Babe.
I love how the sheep are kind of looking out for and taking care of the little guy.
I can’t handle the cuteness

![gif](giphy|xUOwGiZ5dArNC3mJby)
“I guess we’ll let him herd us, he’s so darn cute!”
Nice to meet you.
Hi how are you?
First day?
Oh yea, just joined the team. 
Nice, follow me...
All those sheeps be like awww
It’s like the sheep are teaching him how to be a dog and what he should be doing. so cute
I raise sheep and once my cat went out to where the sheep were. The sheep had never seen a cat. You’d think an alien just walked out of its space craft and they were making first contact. They were so curious.
"and in that moment, I didn't know if I was herding them or they were herding me" - Matthew McConaughey
I needed this right now, so adorable!!!
If there is a hierarki of the best dog life, this dude is on the right track.
Bebè is doing a great job. Such a cute Bebè
Puppy looks pretty young to start training
Its like the puppy whispered “time to go sheep”.
I can clearly vision a entire disney or pixar movie out of this scene....

This is almost like the sheeps mentoring the puppy on it's first day...aww
I like how the sheep keep checking on him like "keep up little guy" or "you're doing great buddy!"
they just wanted to tell him what a good job he was doing :3
Its better to be a warrior in a garden than a gardener in a war.

He has infiltrated successfully. Is his spy name *Baa Ram Ewe*?
I’m a BIG BOY NOW!!
"You best get back in line good sir!"

“We got your back little buddy”
This is just too cute!! I love how the sheep keep checking in with him/her…
THEY’RE HELPING THE NEW GUY!
🥺 omg
It’s just too adorable. It’s melting my heart.
You're doing amazing sweetie
I appreciate the old sheep leaning in close to hear the shy pup
“Don’t worry giant fluffs, I’ll protect you!” (In a puppy voice)
"Come on guys, play along, I'm smol."
Look how proud that little buddy is of doing his job. "I will do these sheep friends a protect. I am big and strong doggo. I keep sheep friends safe."
I love how they keep checking up on him.
It's like the sheep are introducing themselves lol.
Looks like he’s got lots of friends.
This is the sweetest thing I have seen today!
I could watch this all day 🥺
More please
The moment when your senior coworkers are fun, caring, and supportive.
When I get big I’m gonna protect you ladies 🐶Why are dogs so awesome!
What a good boy
I love the way the sheep check him out.
I wonder if they know one day he will be protecting them from harm.
It's so damn cute.
Man this is so god damn adorable
Meanwhile, “Why are these big furry things sniffing me all the time?”
He’s doing so good. What a good dog.
The sheep are like hey kid this way
Omg, adorable. Love how it looks like the sheep are already giving the little man respect
One of the best dogs I ever met was an Anatolian Shepherd that wasn’t fit to protect the flock. He was the dig dog at my archaeological field school, and apparently accidentally fell in a pit and got whacked in the head with a shovel. They named him Bozo and he guarded the dig site, by laying around in the shadiest pits, always with the wolf attack collar on. So if you tripped over him it was not pleasant. Was a super goodest boi for sure.
r/dogswithjobs
The sheep all keep an eye out for that pup cause they know when it grows up it will terminate anything that attempts to attack those sheep
Training? Puppy's crushing it.
"In a few years/months, you will all do my bidding!"

"Yeah well that sounds hard to *behehehehe*lieve right now, tiny dude!" =D
“You keeping up okay, little guy? Are we going too fast?”
Look at all the cuties! The sheep cuties and little doggo cutie!
He just wants new friends
So sweet!🥺
BAA RAM EWE
I feel like this is a scene from a cute Disney film where the sheep are all very encouraging to this puppy
That little baby was like … please someone snuggle me, pick me up and take care of me … I AM A BABY YOU A-HOLES!!!!!
Sheep:come here let me Kiss you
Sheep: Explain your smolness

Pupper: Am pupper.... 
#BUT I AM ALSO SHEPHERD.  NOW MOVE
With his coloring, from a distance he looks like some really tiny lamb.
Muuussst herd something, oh it’s you fluffy doggos, get back in line!
It looks like a pug!
![gif](giphy|125amziK6Y5DJC)

Looks like a baby version
It's like they're teaching him how to herd them 🥰
Baby faced screw meeting the inmates
Sheep: you no come with ush puppy
Puppy : i yesh come with you

That little asshole is killin me, such a cute pupper :D
The enemy!
Animal symbiotic relationships are all so cute… said the tapeworm.
*Sniffing carfully.* Hmmm that's a dogs asshole. *Sniffing deeper and closer* Hmm. Still a dogs asshole. I need to remmember that. *sniiiifffffff*
Wowy wowy wowy that was \*chef's kiss\* perfect and so dang adorable.

That little butt wiggle and how proud he looks. all around wholesome. 10000/10 would watch again and again ;-;
That'll do dog, That'll do
Sheep: are you rookie here ?

Puppy : Im not rookie !! Go ahed !!
Is he training to be a sheep cause he's doing a great job!
These are the guardian sheep dogs yeh?
Look at how tiny it isss!!! I wanna cryyy
Maybe he thinks he is a sheep
Aww!!
"What the heck?"
"OK, ladies. Let's go easy on the new guy."
What is the relationship between sheep dog and sheep. I always assumed the sheep did what the dog wanted out of fear. Are they friendly with eachother? Fo the sheep understand the dog wants whats best for them?
Sheep and shepherd dog are universe's blessing.
This reminds me of lion king. Simba is in training
"Hey, you have to listen to me, my boss is watching."
Good ole dog puppy
I like to think he's trying to yell at the sheep to get back with the herd but he's so small the sheep can't hear him so they get really close to listen
Damn dog must've lived a long life to be Anatolian!
Sam the sheepdog in his younger days.
That puppy is so cute the sheep want to adopt him. ♥️

I didn’t realize sheep had tails
That pup is doing such a great job!
I juuuust can’t wait to be kiiing
I need more of this kind of content.
First day of work
That sheep with red on it ok?
It doesn’t need to train. It’s instinctual, as it’s what the breed was bred to do. That’s how dogs work, despite some protests.
Bah Ram Ewe!
Get along little doggie!  😀
Must herd. Resist cuddles and licks.
C’mon guys, I’m trying to work here!
So tiny!
This is so cute, and amazing, now I need detox and rehab, ….again. Damn you 🐾PPAWS. PUPPY POST, A-Cute Withdrawals.
Omg my heart melted he got pets and lovins from the sheep!
I love how the sheep are checking in on the little one!

How are they trained?  
Must it be a special breed or can any dog be trained for this?
Just some vibe checks. Lol. 😍
Alot of comments on their protective instincts but with all things in biology - they occasionally romance the wolves

https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/dogs-best-friend/201403/when-the-livestock-guard-is-dog-she-might-also-be-wolf-0

Other random fact. These are the longest lived large dogs I know of (80-140 lbs and 10-12 years)
They give hug to him
Can someone make a feature film of this, say 2-3 hours?
Sheep are like "heeyyy, you the new guy?"
Sheep sniffing the dog was like « using threat meter! Results threat 0%! Cuteness 100% Proceed to herd! »
“Oh you must be Bill’s kid, how ya doing lil guy?”
and mastiff tibetian puppies which are the cutest until they reach 1 year old and their mouth is bigger than ur head
He might make a bad shepherd dog but will for sure be a really good friend
Baaaaa Rammm Youu.. Baaaaa Rammm Youu!
Looks like the sheep are taking care of the little guy.
Hermoso 💚
he's doing such a good job 😭😭😭🥺
It's interesting that the sheep do the same thing as dogs do, when smelling other animals.
Hello shep I am doge
The sheep is like "I'm to take orders from this? "
I love how they interact with the kid.
The gentleness is heartwarming
 u/reptiplius an alternative management style
"Not now Gregg. We're at work!"
Totally made my day.  Those dogs are amazing!
I think the sheep are teaching him, sorta
I love dogs
Why is that one sheep all fancy?
I miss my blue heeler. She was one of the best doggos just like everyone else’s.
Love it when he turns and barks at one of the sheep. Meanwhile he’s like the size of the sheep’s head, maybe.
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all week!!
“get to steppin’ or i’ll make sure you get sheared to the bone”
Thanks , now I'm diabetic due to the excess of sweetnes 😍
“The baby”
We are going to be good friends one day said the sheep to the pup
One day it will be strong enough to 1v3 wolves.
I like that they check him out… “oh, you the new guy? You’re sorta smoll but hey! Okay! Jeeeze…..”
Babe? Anyone?
“Is there no one else?!”
Source?
Beautiful. Such a fearless little pup and gentle sheep. Wonderful way to build lifelong friendship and loyalty.
“You are doing good, kid”
Oh well that's just too much ;-;
Karabashes are amazing Id Love another one someday
Is that a kangal?
Adorbs!
So cute and sweet!
Damn, that dog will bring more food to the table than I ever will
Bruh, the curly tail had me thinking it was a pug. 😂
My partner and I adopted our Anatolian Shepherd when he was 1.5 years old. I wish I had seen him as a puppy.
"Eye of the tiger" playing in the background...

I like to think he’s whispering in their ears for them to fall back in line
Once again nature silently confirms that leadership is not learned but rather is born😉👍
We all should start humble, he'll be boss soon.
Can get lost in the herd easily
Bah Ram Ewe - he passes
Such a good boy
These sheep won't have any respect for it when it grows up--they will have known it as a bebe.
Heard a news report about these dogs. They raise them with the sheep so they think that they are sheep and protect the herd. From what I understand they use several dogs trained this way per flock.
I love how it looks like the sheep are offering him tips and cheering him on. 

Someone teach him the passcode from Babe:

Baa-ram-ewe, baa-ram-ewe. To your breed, your fleece, your clan be true. Sheep be true. Baa-ram-ewe.

This guy has a good future in management
Myself had 2 anatolian sheperds, they both had a happy life, sadly one died a year ago

I have to say these dogs are very likeable
I could watch about another hour of this.

This is soooo adorable
What is the red on the sheep?
"Hey, guys, come here......the camera is on, so could you pretend like I'm herding you?"

"I might be smol but I still need respec!!"
I have had two separate dogs. They are true gentle giants unless you threaten the pack. Thank you
That dog will have a good life.
hehe
Hi gus
Like how he went up to each sheep and said the words “Baa, Ram, Ewe” and didn’t shout it out for everyone to hear
The puppy is named CNN if anyone is wondering. Too cute!
I wanna believe the sheep was whispering to the dog what it should be doing l, like “Pssst, just good at me and I’ll start going again, it’ll make you look good, trust me”
"Someone has lost a baby. IGNORE ME!"
“BE THE SHEEP.”
“Get in line people, get in line! I have a face to protect!”

“Billy, you are just an intern honey”
This is Eyebleach
awe the one at the end giving the puppy a cuddle

Back when I was still in the Pyrenees, shepherd used to train patou's puppies (great Pyrenees) the same way.
My heart can’t take this. This is too cute!

Anatolian Shepard's Prime Directive:  The flock is sacred.  Every thing else is not.  

My first encounter with Anatolian shepherds was in 1973, Konya, Turkey.  I was a newly minted F-4 flight lead and as such qualified to supervise an air to ground gunnery range in the middle of the Anatolian Plains.  I was driving an official Air Force "six pack" pickup out to the range on the morning of my first day.  Off in the distance to my left was a herd of sheep. Two dogs decided we were not "sacred" and gave chase.  How quaint.  I expected to leave them in my dust as they homed in on my truck.  To my astonishment, they pulled lead and performed a perfect intercept, aiming at a point several yards in front of me.  It was a fine spring day so I had the window rolled down with my arm resting on the door.  As the dogs got closer, I came to appreciate their pony like size and quickly pulled my arm in and rolled up the window. They could have easily reached my elbow. By the time they got up to us, they reckoned we were no longer a threat to the flock and peeled off and returned to the herd.  I had goose bumps!
Awww, good puppers doing good work!
The ewes are tending him….
"this way, little buddy"
I love sheep so much...they're just so gentle and pure.
So cool. That made me smile.
aw one day he’s gonna be chasing predators off the land but for now he a lil snacc

This is a Kangal, they are separated into two types I believe this is a Karabas kangal they grow up to 6feet + standing up weighting over 130+ pounds. Because of there colour and strength they are used to herd sheep’s to protect them from wolves up on the mountains, they disguise very well
Look at that little scrapper go!
“Look at me, I’m a sheep dog.”
I didn’t know that sheep sniff butts too
Thank you♥️
Looks like he or she is having g fun
So smoll so cute 🥰
Take notes from this guy. Treat your employees how you want to be treated.
That’s so cute
Smol wolf.
Sheep: What the Sheep? Who are you?

Puppy: I'm ~~there~~ the new Pup. The other Dog retired. I'm training.
Teenie weenie little worker. Call animal control, this is child labour!
cuuuuuuuute！
That is one confident pup.
Deffo awww
That last sheep has some serious booty. They all kinda do.
I need more of this video to get me through 2022.
greetings lil’ protector
Little walking fart
I wish this had some sound.  I’d love to hear the big heart from that little one. I love a big dog in a little one.  Love a little dog in a big one.
"When I grow up, there will be a day, when every sheep will have to do what I say"
So cute
I’m tearing up, this is fantastic
"... and this is my auntie. Oh and this is my auntie. Oh and this one is my auntie."

-Sheep Dog
Bobby no you're not supposed to commune and lick those sheep.
Whispering….
”hello, could you guys get the fu*k in line?”
This is the Pixar movie we didn’t know we needed.
r/eyebleach
This is too sweet
So smol!
Respect muh authoriteh
Excuse me sir, can you please continue walking that way?

Good Dog
When you get the great job, but you still have to "grow" into it....
It looks like the sheepees want to mother that pup but the pup’s having NONE of it!
"here lil fella, we do it like this!  Keep up!!"
Haha, this Lil pup is the best. Just trotting along side it's herd.
\[sniffs\]

Whoaa! Hold on, who are you?
Aight, you good.
Aw
“One of us, one of us…”
So cute!!! 😩

Anatolians are the best! My Australian and German mixes best friend in the neighborhood is this huge, calm Anatolian. Such a sweetheart!
He protec, He attac

Cute doj
That’s a pug
This is so cute! I have an Anatolian back home we got him when he was two so it’s so nice to see a tiny puppy version
I don't know what that sheep said, but the definitely heard him.
Sheep: “hey there little guy! Here’s a little tip and trick for you”
Hahaha this is awesome!
That is so cute
I love how all the lambs go "*sniff Not mine."
Cutest thing I've seen all day.
It soooooooooooo cute to see that
Okay so Um… more of THIS please
Look like the sheep are doing the training.
The littlest lamb omg
I like how the sheep are like "oh what dis cute lil thing?" And sniff the doggy really gently.
Toooo cute
replace the puppy with Fenton!!!!!
I'm proud of that little boii
with time he will learn
that he not a goat
but a guardian dog
Reminds me of some of the younger managers at work...
he's doing such a great job!
Is that last sheep bloody around his neck?
His little tail wagging when they stop to sniff him is too cute
He’ll grow up to be a warrior
I will never ever eat neat anymore. Never.
Time to watch Babe, I guess.
Sooo adorable, and I learned so much on this thread. My boyfriend has an Anatolian mix, and I always interpreted some of his behavior as herding, since Shepherd is in his breed name. But now I know he’s a guardian dog, which makes way more sense. Very sweet, kind dog
Baa ram ewe!
He is doing good!
Go little man.love the dog doing his job.
Love mine. Greatest coyote killers to exist
This made my day, so thank you for that!
"You're doing great buddy keep going come on"
I want a Pixar movie of this
Yeah this stuff makes me tear up 😍
r/dogswithjobs
Haha. The sheep must be telling him how good a job he's doing ☺️
Pupper: Walk... walk... walk. I am smol.
This reminds be of when a young spunky supervisor is put in charge of a bunch of older more experienced people. And they are helping him get his feet planted and teach him the right way of supervising.
The cuddles on the way! :)
What a cutie. Looks like they're not intimidated yet.
He’s doing such a good job :,) I’m too emotional for this today
I have an Anatolian shepherd. They are the BEST dogs.
Aww
* you’re supposed to be scared of me *
Precious. I’m crying but that could be from being sick but also bc this is actually precious. Good pup and good sheep checking in on the new guy.
What a precious little bean. So cute!
I have an ASD. They are absolutely as sweet and protective as this one will clearly be when he or she grows up. Amazing dogs, definitely worth the wait to grow out of puppyhood!

Omg this is so cute
Those dogs are fucking monsters when they grow up. I have a full grown GSD, 35 kilos, and 3 houses down they have an Anatolian. The owner wanted to socialize her pup and my dog is great with puppies so we had few play date. The Anatolian Shep was taller and longer than my dog at 5months old.

I'm away at the moment but when I get back I imagine the size difference will be immense.
Underrated breed
why animals always smell asses and why don't we ?
One of us. One of us
I love how the sheep are like: awww look a puppy ok herd me little man
Plucky little thing 😍
"hi kiddo, first day on the job?"
"move dammit, u don't wann be messing with with me...hey stop kissing me!"
Someone say something with Shawn the sheep!?
His training is going well, he has "puppy" down pat!
Repost from last night.
Cutie 🥰
How do shepherd dogs know what to do?
“Nothin to see here, fellas! Move along!”
All sheep tricks to get awards. The puppy and sheep are paid actors
“C’mon guys! Take me seriously!”
I wonder if they know he will grow up to guard them.
“Hey look, I wonder who lost their lamb?”
…sniff sniff…”Oh no it’s a dog!”…runs away

“Now why is everyone running away from that poor lost little lamb and not helping it? The nerve of some sheep!”

“There there dear”…sniff sniff………..

ಠ_ಠ

Runs ways
The Force is strong with this one.
that pup put all its points into charisma
He is already good at it
See? it's easy 👴🏻
Captain Holt would be proud
He needs to wash that ass
I just imagine a little baby voice saying “alright March no more sniffing let’s keep it moving!”
He is a little lamb himself
