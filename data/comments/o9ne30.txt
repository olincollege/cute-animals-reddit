What a gorgeous dog and smart. One of the best things you could have taught your dog,  it could possibly save it‚Äôs life.
Such a good doggo
Smart baby!!
Everywhere the grass touches is our kingdom.

What about that asphalt-y place over there?

That‚Äôs the road, doggo. You must never go there.
He‚Äôs the best boy
What a well behaved doggo!
Am I the only one who thought that dude was Brock Lesnar for a second? üòÇ
looks like brock lesnar from the back
Is that dog dad Brock Lesnar
He went from good boy to rocket pup very quickly lol
Sweet pup
I am the dog - my ball it rolled

into the Street! must *STAY* am told 

I listen to my friend's command -

'Stay Out of Street!'  

I understand ^:@)

He keeps me safe where i belong,

my human comes to get the ball,

as I await Best part of all -

as once again he toss my toy,

GOOD BOY!

‚ù§Ô∏è
Thought this was Brock Lesnar for a moment
Sweet pup! Way to be a good dog!
ü•∫ü•∫ the most patient boy
Brock Lesnar trains a good dog
Doggo knows what happens if HOA sees him playing in the road.
Excellent zoom control cam guy
Is/Was there an electric fence? Just curious, neighbors have one and one of their dogs now lives as if he had the collar on at the property lines without the collar on.

&#x200B;

Either way, well trained!

If I let my dog off the leash she finds the nearest road and plays in it.
That‚Äôs a really good boy üê∂
This is much more impactful the initially thought. With the owner drawing near most dogs would take that as a go ahead to grab the ball but they don‚Äôt. That little hand flick is the owner saying no to the dog. A good owner and a good dog!
Good boy
Dude looks like Brock Lesnar
Gooo boy!
Such a good boy
I thought that was brock lesnar for a minute
I didn't know Brock Lesner owned a golden retriever.
Invisible fence?
Now that's one GOOD BOY
That catch was pretty impressive as well. What a good boyo.
good human!

train you dog, and prioritize training skills that are meant to save their life, like this one
Daaad! My ball rolled into the street again! What a good doggo! Sitting there patiently waiting. Well trained.
Such a Goode boiiee!! How hard is it to train a dog to do smth like this? How long before you trust a puppy off his leash without them running away? Thinking about getting a kitten and a puppy
I see people wondering if they used an electric collar. I can say it's possible to train a dog to do this with out as my grandpa has.
Such a good boi
good doggo awww
The road is lava
What a good dog. How would one teach a boundary such as that?
Omg!

I thought my dog road safety; eheninly crosses on my command and I swear I thought I was the only one!

Such a good doggo
Such a dad gesture. Even though you're sitting and waiting obediently, they still do the "stay there" gesture.

Such a good boy!
What a good boi
Confirmed good boy

That looks like good training, well done!

"Fetch daddy. "
It's cute till you realize he was trained on an e-fence https://www.dogtra.com/products/e-fence
So the fence in yard electroshock therapy training works huh.

*tounge in cheek joke, relax ppl lol.
‚ÄúNo, no.. Take you‚Äôre time. I‚Äôll wait‚Äù
well trained pup!! i used to train my horse to slow down whenever we were getting to a street too.
Such a good dog. Why is it that dogs understand better than kids?
Well trained and good behavior? How refreshing, to the top, please.
That‚Äôs such a good doggo take my award I hope you get some nice treats and belly rubs
Wow. Very well trained!! Well on the other hand, my husky üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Goodog!
Good dog and good human for training the baby to be safe.
Doggo made a new zero to 60 record when pops put the ball back in play.

What a great man-dog connection!
This dog is awesome very well behaved better than most kids and adults lol
Paps looks like Brock lesnar from the back
Safety Boi!
Great work on the Owner‚Äôs part for training, and Stellar performance by this Best Buddy Boy!
Well if that‚Äôs not the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen, I don‚Äôt know what is.

Did he catch the ball on the first bounce?
Great training. Applause to dog and owner

This is the goodest boi
How do I train my puppy this lol
Is that Brock Lesnar‚Äôs doggo??
My GSD does the same thing in my alley. Only thing is, he makes a game out of it sometimes and kicks the ball in the alley on purpose and stares at me until I get it.
Good! Road bad, stay safe, doggo. <3
That‚Äôs amazing! Such a smart pupper!
For a moment I thought that this guy is Brock Lesnar

Brock lesnar and his best friend
My dog would just go on the pavement regardless
My black lab used to do this as well, except he would sit there and bark at it until we got it for him, then prance around with it for a while afterward to show us how proud he was.

I miss that dog so damned much.
The most downvoted comment on this thread in 3 hours will be some variant of "Brock Lesnar fetches ball for doggo".
I cant belive the waited to someone to gave him the ball

Guessing a golden doodle
Is that Brock Lesnar???
I thought this headline was about a celebrity on house arrest who had the paparazzi get his ball.
When I saw "paps" I thought that meant "paparazzi". Please specify next time
Good Boy .
Who dresses like that?
And that‚Äôs how they are supposed to be..
Dogs know boundaries very well.   A friend had a Doberman that absolutely hated rain but also was potty trained to only go on the grass in this one section of yard.  

So, during a downpour, puppers needs to go and the best she could do was remain under cover under the awning and stick her butt out over the edge of the grass and do her business.  

The whole time wincing as the overflowing gutter doused her hind quarters.    It was pathetic and adorable at the same time.
When I was a small child we adopted a huge black dog we named Bear. We lived in a tiny cabin in the middle of the Rockies with no neighbors anywhere close. If we went running down the drive way, Bear would wait until we were about 3 feet from the dirt road at the end and run in front of us to keep us out of the road. He also led our litter of puppies into the woods and came back without them. Luckily we did find them. I miss Bear.
Great Dog, has more discipline than most people I know
ü•∫ puppers sitting so patiently
I have 4 indoor cats that we let outside for about an hour each day and sit outside with them. Even though we have a reasonably large back yard, they all know where the boundaries are and are very good boys by not going beyond.
Goodness

UK here and PAPs usually is referring to Paparazzi.

And the EUFA football matches are here.

I thought some footballer had kicked the ball over the stadium and a photographer went and got it for him.

I am not disappointed I was wrong
Teach me master!
Now *that* is a ***good dog!***
Great dog training... my mutt lunges at cars when they go pass... its going to be a long year.
He knows if paps doesn't get the ball, he might get smeared.
I need karma can you guys help
Possible invisible fence.    But. Also
Could be a Really good dog.
Such a good boy. That‚Äôs awesome
Paps looks like Brock Lesnar
What a good boi!
I wish the local neighbourhood dogs were as well trained as this good dog.
My uncles dog was trained to walk to the edge of the pavement and to wait for his order to cross. Super well behaved. The problem was he went on holiday and left me in charge so the dog got to the end of the street and went absolutely no further. Couldn't tempt him across with treats or anything else. Ended up just having to walk him around the garden for two weeks until my uncle came home.
Good dog. Good hooman.
what an obedient boy!
Doodles are the best dogs
Must be nice.
As a dog owner, I can 100% confirm that the dog rolls the ball into the street on purpose all the time just to spite the owner. ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm not allowed out there. Oh nooo, I‚Äôve dropped the ball out there agaaaaain.‚Äù
What a well trained goodest doggo :)
How do you even train a dog to do this
I had a dog for 8 years,is the worst feeling when you lose it‚Ä¶

Wish everyone took the time to raise a dog with manners.
Haha! Couple of legends guysüöÄ
Holy shit its Brock Lesnar! üòù
What a good boyüê∂üòÅ‚ù§
I‚Äôve taught my dog to sit and wait before crossing the street when we walk. How do you train a dog to simply not cross the street when they‚Äôre off leash?
Now that‚Äôs a good dog
My dog would do this but he eventually learned that purposefully letting his ball roll into the street was a good way to get people going for walks/me inside the house to come over and play with him
That haircut screams military or cop lol.
What a good doggy

My puppy woulda taken that ball further down the road
Who's a good doggie
Good pupper
Ball ball ball ball, gimme ball
What a good doggy!
Good boy
We had a box who would do this. We lived on a hill and her ball would constantly roll down and to the other side of the road. My dog would just give turn around and give me the saddest look until I got her ball.
Dogs scared of getting an f5 or going to suplex city.
Those zooming skills tho
Well-trained dogs are the easily the best
It warms my heart to see such a well trained dog.
That‚Äôs a good dog! Awwwe!
It was just last year I finally taught my cat not to swerve at pedestrians while driving, and that lawnmowers are for grass, not flower beds.
How does one teach their dog to do this??
Thats a good smart boy. üëç
how do you do that???
What a good boy and thanks to his dad for training so well.
That‚Äôs a very good doggo.
Looking at my dog: Why can't you be like that Max?  Why?
More well behaved than my nephews lol
r/MaliciousCompliance
Good boy!
Look, Simba. Everything the light touches is our kingdom.
Whatta Good Boi!
Paps balls are the best balls
My dog would purposefully roll his ball down the driveway and make us go get it because he knew he wasn‚Äôt allowed on the street. He was really just making us play fetch.
Goodest of boys will be around a long time with safety training like that!  Extra pats for this one!
Sometimes I wonder if the dogs are the true masters....
That‚Äôs right! My dog waits on the sidewalk too.
What a good boi!!! üòç
That's heckin' impressive.  Good boy!
That looks like a labradoodle! üòÄ My friend has a 5 year old female labradoodle. She loves to fetch the ball. She‚Äôs super coordinated and athletic! Again, she LOVES fetch the ball! üéæüòÄ
Ho
Poggers, great way to keep your dog safe :)
when you throw your ball in the road so paps will throw it for you (got his? hooman well trained)
This made me smile so much.  Dogs really DO behave better than.....I won't say it.
We trained our dog to not go further then the sidewalk. She gets it and stretches as far as she can to sniff the grass on the other side but stays on the sidewalk....lol
The bestest boi!!!
Road is Food
Good Doggo

...but have you noticed that those really good doggos will 'present' at a crosswalk and stand ever so prim and proper with all the other people waiting to cross, that they have sense of self-awareness where you genuinely think that they obey this rule not b/c they are good doggos, but that they have joined the human community.
Fake, electric fence
Guy looks like Lesnar.
Wait a minute he looks like Brock lesner
What a good dog
Smart move :D Smart Dogie üêï
That is such a great thing to teach. His human gets the ball for him.
Ok this reminds me of a story of an English bulldog in the neighborhood I lived in in Brooklyn. He would hang out in the front yard during the day surrounded by a chain link fence. One day I saw his Kong toy had rolled out under a little gap the fence where the chain link didn't meet the side walk and he couldn't get the toy. He was standing there looking right at it, obviously wanted it so I grabbed it for him and tossed it back in for him. Lil bugger ran and grabbed the Kong and came and popped it right back out under the fence with his nose. Gamed me so hard.

That's such a good boy
I can't even get my kids to do that.
so cuteee
Wish my current dog did this.

If she gets out without a lead on its chaos time. 

She runs around all the neighbours sniffing all her favourite bushes and trees in both sides of the street. Completely ignoring roads and cars. 

If I try and recover her she just runs faster. She no longer comes back for treats. 

She's a giant scardy cat though so she only ever goes a couple houses in each direction before returning to the house again. 

Still very annoying. 

I walk her over 3km twice a day when I pick up and drop off the kids from school.
Wanna squeeze doggie it like the squoz for my stonk
Doodle do what doodle does.

Lol, he still did the "stay there" hand motion. Dog was probably like "yeah no shi* Steve. Get the ball already."
Wish my kids were a fraction of how smart this good boy/girl is
That‚Äôs such a good thing to train to pets omg. 

My little Joey was very much not afraid of traffic.. savor your friends, everyone, give them some extra lovin‚Äô!
What a well trained pup! Kudos to the owners
honestly thought this was brock lesnar for a moment..
Slowly but surely, we're getting our cat to treat the kitchen the same way.
Who trained who here.
Invisible Fence?
"That's a good boy!" said the dog.
Well, we finally found the goodest boy/girl. Delete the internet now.
Growing up our neighbors had a lab that knew exactly where the property lines were and would NOT cross them. It was truly amazing. There were no electric fences or shock collars involved, this dog was just incredibly obedient.
Oh why a good boy!
Cute, smart, good listener, playful, and adorable!  This dogs got more skills than my ex!
Watch him get hit by a powerwheel lol
Looks like my pupper. He‚Äôs just as daft
I wish my dog listened like this 


I wish my dog listened.
All dog owners should be that responsible.

When I walk in a park and I get some crazy barfing and jumping dog in my face that's half the size of the owner and the owner says "He usually never does that", what do you think I think of that?
Aww puppy!!
Brock Lesnar looking well
Good boy!
We trained our dog to respect the curb by putting him back up on it every time he hopped off from the yard. That worked well until he found the loophole after getting walked on the leash. Whenever he went over to the neighbors yard he would use the crosswalk.
That is a wellll trained dog.
Invisible fence.
Mine does this too! He sometimes ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù nudges it off the front balcony but knows he has to get permission to actually go down the stairs! Love dogs!
Underground electric boundaries are wonderful.

Humans will never experience the pure joy of that dog when that ball was thrown from the street.
My mom had a nursery for plants and my aunt stopped by. Ran over the dog everyone started screaming she put it in reverse, even more screaming. She then decided to park ON the dog. Dog lived, no broken bones. English bulldogs have horrible genes, but are built like a god dam brick.
Good boy
Good dog! Knows better than to run into the hot street!
That's impressive obedience.
That's the best pup

Why does he look like brock Lesnar from the back?
I remember watching my neighbor train his dog to not go in the street.  He smacked the shit out of that dog!  He never went in the street though...
I wouldn‚Äôt go either if my paps was Brock Lesnar
Good boy!
Invisible fences are great
Good boi/girl
That is a very good doggo and a very good owner. Safety first!
That‚Äôs some good training!
Holy fuck I wish my dog had this much discipline.
That‚Äôs a bestest boi if I ever saw one
At first I read it as ‚Äúso you wait for the ball to come to you‚Äù.
Such a manly walk 

I'm feeling the toxic masculinity
Axle doesn‚Äôt listen for anything and the air is lava. Got him a kiddie pool but I‚Äôm the only one in it. Lol Virginia is lava!
What a good, polite/considerate pup!
My old boy does the same thing. Very nice!!
That dog was trained with a shock collar
This is self restraint! And very awesome. I wish my dogs growing up were this disciplined
BTW, this is one of the first things you should teach your dog. They should never step onto asphalt, whether they are on a leash or not, unless you give a command word like "Okay."
Good boy.
very best girl/boy
Such a good boy üòç
Good boy :)
My dog wouldn‚Äôt come into my room without permission. He‚Äôd stand at the door even when open and wait for me to invite him in. He wasn‚Äôt trained that way.
That is a well trained dog.
100% electric fence trained
Like my wife always says about our dogs, that‚Äôs a certified good boy right there.
My dog is like this. And I love that he is.
I‚Äôm so teaching my dog this
GOOD DOG!
Dogs probably have no idea why they can't go there, but just obey anyway
There might be one of those invisible fences.  My sister had one. It‚Äôs basically a buried line that signals the dog‚Äôs collar to give the dog a little shock.  (I tried it out on my hand.. it was enough to get my attention for sure, but nothing terrible)  

After a little while, the dog didn‚Äôt even need to be wearing the collar.  He just stopped at the line.
Wilson wants his ball back
Good boy!

This is so cute. He's doing that for the dog's own protection!

Always happy to see responsible dog owners taking the initiative to train their feline friends.
Isn't that the dude that yelled at the kid for being in his neighborhood? ,ü§£
There's a person who cares.
I wonder if it is trained like that with nothing else or this is one of those electric fences to kept the dog in there
His name is Moonlight Graham. If he steps onto the pavement, he can never play ball again.
Live Long and Wag Tail :)

Such a good smart Golden!!! So sweet and smart!!
I don't know, I'm not normally this skeptical, but I think this dude set the ball on the road and used a trained stay command to keep the dog there. I can't imagine a young dog containing itself enough to STOP actively chasing a ball into the street and I feel the ball wouldn't naturally stop in this location on the street.
Good dog!
Ohhhhh so good!!
If that dog was trained without a shock collar then damn‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs amazing
