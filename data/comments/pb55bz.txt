That is one grumpy looking cloud
Someone’s poor grandfather was transformed into a cat 300 years ago, and it looks like the only way to break the spell and finally put his soul to rest is to feed him an entire container of 500 treats.
I mean ol boy requested his treats with respect and poise. He's earned them at this point.
Give that wizard some treats
I have never seen such an accurate impression or my grandfather before!
Oh god that is adorable 😍 c'mon get with the program human...
Please open jar, this is an order

Is that cat cross-eyed?
So smug when it looks up from the treats. Obviously you're too dim to figure that one out on your own.
![gif](giphy|H24Zi5xbFKc1i)
And he *means* it!
Cowardly Lion
What a regal looking cat!
And that’s how cats are too smart to always do what you ask them to. They ask us to do sh’t all the time and we don’t do it, so why should they?
There is something wrong with this jar.

It is closed.

Do something about it!
Cross-eyed Ron Perlman demands satisfaction.
That cat looks way too serious and not serious at the same time
I love that face. Somehow seems more human than a typical cat face.
/r/CatTaps
I love that face!
He is perfect. I love him.
That face!! 😍
The Lorax is hungry. Please feed him. And stop cutting down trees.
Oh he's mad, you better give him the treats
[removed]
Your cat is fabulous!!!
I feel like that cat is going to kick your ass if you don't listen to them.
Omg I am in love with that cat
Rookie mistake! Never keep cat treats where the cats can see them!
“get off your fat ass and give me food”
S'cuse me sir. I'm cross eyed and grumpy. But I'll gladly be polite if you'd grant me some treats from right over hyarr.
This is the Jim Gaffigan of cats
Hooman i deserve some treat please im begging..
Oh lord it's a Ron Swanson cat!
That's the first cat that I've ever seen that looks like it won't scratch you but instead give a stern lecture.

Malkovich?
What type of cat is this? He’s so perfect.
Cute until you give him one and learns he just needs to bug you for a treat. Ive made that mistake too many times.
That cat has human eyes. 😂🤣
That is one hell of a face/cross-eyed fluff combo.

This is my spirit animal
Lol! That is exactly what my cat does
Cat is straight up using gestures. That is fine next level shit.
Never saw a crosseyed cat before lol
"My bidding, slave... do it."
Why does he remind me of Wilford Brimley?  Do you have Diabeteas?
That cat looks like Bubbles.
He doesn’t protecc, he doesn’t attacc,

Feed the damn cat already!
"gimme fud, hooman"
What a smart puss & just fabulous looking.
Oh that's a clever cat.

"Hey you, give me this." Like trying to talk to someone in a language you don't understand.

I think your cat is mafia

Is that a man in a cat suit?
Thought grumpy cloud was going to slap the glasses off to prove a point…knowing it’d get my attention!
I name your car Gus. He looks like a good guy that’s worked on the docks for 30 years and is retired on disability. Bad back. 

Give him a treat! He’s lived a hard life.
Bubbles ? Is that you?
Your cat appears to be the reincarnation of Bert Lahr.
What a fucking specimen of a cat.
Oh I've never seen a mixed flame point siamese before! I love how this cat looks!

Our cat’s food bowls are in the living room near the TV and he will sit on the body scales we have near his food staring at us until we give him more dry, as if to say “look at me, I’m wasting away, look how underweight I am!”
This cat looks like Bobby Hill

Atchyaforya eyes.  One eye’s looking atch ya the other is looking for ya
Grumpy looking but extremely polite cat.
He seems... Cross
Haha! We give my orange boi food in these toy mice and then hide them around our home so he has to hunt for his kibbies, but we also give him a little scoop just in his bowl so he can calm down when I’m trying to hide the mice. Usually I do bowl, then mice, but lately I’ve been switching it up and he will do this exact same thing! Paws at me and then paws in his empty bowl and then paws at me again like “mom!! You do THIS first!!”
Hey bub since your sitting there how bout you give me a couple of these
Bro looks like the wizard of oz lion!
I love the expression on that cats face
I thought it was gonna touch the glasses next.

Omg I am dead 💀 😭 I can’t handle this much cuteness!!
GIVE HIM FOOD 🥺
I have never seen a cat with a grumpy resting face
If this is not but the most gorgeous thing!
So polite! My little sod will knock the tub on the floor and scoot it around until the lid loosens enough to get treats (or make enough noise to summon a human). The treats now get shut away in a cat proof drawer.
I've watched this about 300 times and can't stop laughing.
r/petthedamncat
Y'all saying Wilford Brimley or Ron Perlman but clearly this dude looks most like Jesse Plemons
This cat looks like his name would be Bubba.
That face makes it seem like that was not the cats first hint to its human.
I hope you fed her well after filming.
That too funny.
Just brighten my day! My cat does this tapping too when he wants something. Except that he stops at tapping me only. So I have to guess what is it that he wants! 😅
*"Why so serious?"*
That cat looks like Stipe Miochic.
I love that face. 💜
That human is living rent-free in the house
Never seen a squinty cat.

I think cats are smarter than we realize. They're just not perceived that way cause they don't play along if they don't want to.

Cute polite kitty definitely deserves a treat!

Kitty's asking for corrective glasses.

I wonder what he wants?
Hahahaha.  Got my vote

What a smart cat! 😊 adorable
My god he’s beautiful
This cat is wayyyy to fucking cute
It’s like a king commending his servant lol
My floof is so much less subtle. He just pushes them off the table and hopes for the best. It worked once and we're found him passed out on his back 3 ft away. I'm not sure how he didn't get sick from eating all those treats.
Looks like Jordan Peterson
Adorable kitty 😻 and I hope for his/her talent there were 2 treats✅
That is one of the cutest cats I ever seen in my life- and I've seen A LOT of cute cats
Cats are sooo much smarter than most people realize. If you haven't watched the video of cats seeing their owners in a snapchat filter, you absolutely should. They apparently understand what they see on the selfie camera is actually them. A level of self awareness that is truly astonishing in comparison to previous assumptions on their cognition.
If Jim Gaffigan was a cat.
That cat looks like a very perplexed Grover Cleveland.

I’m hungry mother, I really am

That’s possibly the most adorable fluffy goofball looking cat I’ve ever seen. I’m not even a cat person, and I wanna smoosh him!
Cat should put on the glasses.
Cats aren't allowed to be that cute. Stop it.
My cat just hops up and paws them off the table, we have to keep them in a drawer.
Looks dumb is smart
Hy cat begs for treats by standing on the bag and repeatedly pulling the end up so it makes a noise while meowing pitifully
If “smarter than you look” were a cat.
Fluffy wants treerrtttttss
Looks like Fivel's mate from An American Tail
This cat could probably be trained to use speech buttons. The whole "correlate touching one thing with another thing happening" part was the roadblock my cat couldn't get over.

That cat looks like an angry Bobby Lee
I want so badly to give all the petties. The floof demands treats, I shall gives treats and petties and snuggles. 

I have a big black poofafloof of a cat, and he is so precious. He's an absolute nightmare when he goes out hinting in the yard. He brings back all kinds of carcasses home including birds, chipmunks, and bunnies, and keeps coming back with little velcro pickers in his fur.

But getting to snuggle up next to him and have him purr like a small block chevy is heartwarming.
Why does everyone else get the cool cats?
Awwiee she s a cutie. Give it to her😝
This cat will be picking out investments in no time.
I love cats but man that’s a face only a mother could love

It's actually fucking annoying.
