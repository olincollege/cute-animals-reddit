Meowdy! The folks at r/SupermodelCats would sure appreciate this catto
What camera did you use? Edited?
Firestar?
Would you mind if I drew your cat? I’m not a particularly talented artist, but I post to Twitter anyway. Linking back here of course!
So photogenic!
Is this heavily edited? You can see the hypersaturation as pink on the whiskers. Pretty cat.
thats a heckin‘ handsome boy!
Quick question: Can I have your cat?
Great pic.  The rose right over his head looks a little like a puppy sticking its tongue out.
ohh my. this is perfect, if I were you I'd definitely submit this to r/pics
I loooove abyssinian/somalian cats. They're so pretty.
I’ve never seen a meow with that kind of coloring, absolutely gorgeous.
Abyssinian?

He makes me think of that National Geographic photo of the Afghani girl in the red scarf with the big, pale green eyes.
Majestic home royalty.

r/eyebleach
Please don't let your cats roam outside its bad for the environment.
I fucking hate cats but this one and this picture are lovely
This cat is breathtaking! I will tell my most photogenic cat that she is obsolete and will need you to canvas at least 15 different pics of your cat to replace the wall art that my cat has produced! I am usually into black and white photos of our cat, but will require color photo's of yours!
I'll give you $20 for it, deal?
I've been thinking about getting a cat for a while. I love alone and it would be so nice. Some day!
Is this cute? Idk, I’m not questioning how great of a picture it is or how awesome looking the cat is, but is the picture cute?? Idk, I guess it’s just interesting the subjectivity of what one considers to be cute. I think it’s an amazing photo, but it doesn’t necessarily make me go “aww.” Idk, just an observation I guess! Again, great photo! Awesome cat!

EDIT: Why tf am I getting downvoted? I was just speaking my mind on my subjective opinion of what cute is and trying to start a discussion of that topic. I guess I crossed some line?? I don’t understand.
Can I have your kitten kitten please?
Wow! Maybe you have this photo in another resolution? Want to set in on wallpaper.
Okay, you took a picture of your smelly cat. Great. How about your family, like the actual people who raised you?
