I love the fact that he sits like a fat little goblin
Cat looks like a grumpy old man who has finally found something (or someone in this case) that makes him happy
M cat is incredibly dainty and skittish with folks she doesn't know. So when my husband and I moved in together, she spent most of her time under the bed. The first time he got to pet her was like a piece of history. Now she has this ridiculous relationship with him. With me she gets sweet elegant pets, but when she wants more, she goes to my husband who gives her a hard core scratching that has come to be know as "the cat wash". He even sings it as he pets her. And always at the end she has to bite his nose. It's tradition.

Add on: 

Ok everyone! I got my husband to do the CATWASH. E was very awkward and chose not to sing it but I got it

That‚Äôs how you know he‚Äôs a keeper. I too was judged by my wife‚Äôs cat 10 years ago. Luckily Lily approved of my existence in her house.

RIP Lily.
YOUR boyfriend?
When I first met my wife she had a tabby cat that she claimed liked no one but her.  Well he actually came out of hiding the first time I was at her place and came up to me.  I think the last thing I told him  when we had to put him down was a thank you for being my unexpected wingman.
Somebody is in love!
"You're alright, human. My servant has good taste. I'll make a proper servant of you as well."
This is exactly how my orange boy looks at me and it breaks my heart every time
This is so precious
Accept you are the "side chick" now..
I have a cat that traded me in for my boyfriend. It's cool, I'm not mad, just a little jealous. We'll get through this together.
your boyfriend now belongs to the cat
Orange Tabby cats are the best!!!!
This is so heartwarming. Your cat is literally radiating love. That‚Äôs the stamp of approval you need to see. Years ago my cat assessed my boyfriend and approved him and now he‚Äôs my husband and a great daddy. My heart melts whenever I see them together.
r/catsmirin
Your cat has a new bf
Your cat looks high af
I believe pets pick on on their paw-rents feelings. My dogs love my fianc√© and have since they met him. One of my dogs is standoffish with all strangers. But not with him. 

So you must also adore him, your cat knows, and emulates the behavior. That‚Äôs sweet.
I feel a bit sad you don't realize that is no longer your cat. ;)
When I started dating my husband and he came over the first time i told him my feral cat would run away and not to worry about her attacking him. She stayed on the couch and let him pet her head. He has some kind of special power over cats.
So sweet! As a guy that means your good. Conversely my cat judges any girl I bring home. My current gf gets a win but an ex had her boots pissed in
Your boyfriend has been stolen by the Cato
This picture is worth a thousands words, but one will suffice, love.
Lookin' like The Buddha.
‚ÄúThanks for bringing me a pet Mom‚Äù
Is his name Jim?
Ive been with many women I never would have stood a chance with, on account that their pets jumped with joy at the sight of me and curled up with me just like this cat.
Or it‚Äôs high
The cats face just says it all ‚Äòhe‚Äôs OUR boyfriend now‚Äô
Your kitty looks a lot like [mine](http://imgur.com/a/2JnFplX). :)
I had a cat for two weeks before my boyfriend and I moved in together. He immediately took to him and started calling him Buddy. He was his cat now, lol. That was 8 years ago, I don't remember what I initially named him now. He was a good Buddy!
You're ginger kitty is so cute! Looking super happy too!

Edit: typo
"Together, we will solve this woman-human."
I think you mean your boyfriend's cat tolerates you üòÇ
I hand raised my cat (abandoned by mom), met my man when the cat was 2. Cat is 12 now and hasn't been "my cat" for at least 8 years. Means your dude is a good soul ‚ù§
You just lost yor man to a cat, how do you feel?
Find a person that looks at you the way this cat looks at this guy
Thats how my boys look at my wife. Nobody looks at me like that. Not even my wife.
Awww... Look at them bubblegum beans.
Is that Novak Djokovic?
Haha he sits like a people do haha
/r/catsmirin
Please give your kitty a snuggle. He looks just like my cat that passed away, down to the little bitty ‚Äúdipped his paws in paint‚Äù. 

Also, keep the boyfriend. When cats decide they adore someone like this- cats don‚Äôt just trust anyone. It‚Äôs a good sign
I‚Äôm sorry to tell you this but that‚Äôs not your cat anymore
My cat is always suspicious of men lmao but she likes my roommates bf lolol
Jim.
you are the third wheel. sorry.
That is completely adorable. Also, your cat looks like Winnie the Pooh!
What an adorable little traitor.
Thats not your boyfriend anymore.
It‚Äôs all cute until you are competing for attention with the cat
That's what a drunk cat looks like.
You're stuck with him now. When my wife and I started dating, her cat took quite a liking to me, and now we just celebrated one year of marriage! The cat chooses all.
Tell him ‚Äúnice shirt, c*nt‚Äù
Me at night seeing a moth fly into the light
The cat:

*Our* boyfriend
that cat is so adorable

You mean your cats boyfriend?
BEHOLD

THE STEAL-YOUR-MAN-INATOR
Man spread....cat spread?
From my experience, this just means he is allergic to cats. I am pretty allergic to cats and they all love me. Even the ones "who hate everyone and everything". I wouldn't mind the love if I wasn't constantly sneezing, unable to breathe through my nose, and unable to see through watery, irritated eyes.

When someone has a cat, I try to take a Claritin or something before I go so they can love on me a bit. It doesn't make me immune but it lessens the effect.
How he sits is so cute
This is the most adorable mirin photo I have ever seen!!!  I hope he adores you, too!
"I tell ya, it's nice to have another dude around here Jim."
It's very validating when your animal companion accepts/loves your partner. My bf and cat have a bedtime cuddle routine that I adore (and occasionally get jealous of - gimme those kitty good night cuddles!)
When I pause to take a break from this excruciating online life, such things make me wanna live another day so that one day I can afford raising a pet <3
Marry him
That‚Äôs it. You have to marry him now. For your cat.
That's the face of a grumpy, old man sitting in his favourite chair and about to be handed a cup of tea.
I too adore your ~~boyfriend~~ cat.
jim
One needs to find someone who looks at them the same way your cat looks at your boyfriend.

I love your cat's sitting position in this picture
Awww... Sweet
 When I started visiting my GF, her car hid the whole time and 30 minutes after I left. She had since warmed up to me and is now a sassy calico who decides when she wants to grace us with her presence.
how i look at my bae lol
u/studentdoctoramp OMG AWWWW! Look at his little faceeeee!!!
Aww, so cute! Sometimes I wish I wasn't allergic to cats so I could get love like that <3
That isn‚Äôt your boyfriend, that‚Äôs you cat‚Äôs boyfriend.
I‚Äôve never wanted to rub a little cat fuzzy belly so bad!! That look is priceless
My cat had to approve of my boyfriend as well. She absolutely hated my ex. But she loves my man of 10 years. Lol I swear she loves him more than she loves me.
they look like they chill together and smoke weed
I'm so glad I clicked on the picture to see the whole thing!

Your boyfriend is a happy man, not only you like it, but also your cat likes it. If I have such a cat, I like it to sit on [my shoes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lxfashionartsneakers/) and be lazy.
Cat has determined he's a keeper
Such a cute cat
I'm at the bitter dating stage where I resent cute couples, so I hate you both, but the cat is adorable.
How to tell if someone is a good person.
It looks like he also had some catnip and is enjoying the viee
Orange tabbies are usually so lovable.
Your cat looks very old and wise
Cat looks like he got a good whiff of catnip.
Judging your boyfriend's smile I'd say he adores the cat as well.
My partner is afraid of cats and my cat is afraid of new people but when they first met it was love at first sight
Dude‚Äôs got a nice nose
The bros, the homies...

Sorry it‚Äôs not your cat anymore
The boyfriend can stay.

She looks totally 'steal your boy' type
üíìüíìüíì
Love cats. Hate cat hair on my clothes and furniture.
And your bf knows it.
I love dogs and cats but there‚Äôs something special about the loyalty and affection of a cat. It‚Äôs an honest, genuine emotion they exude, gives the feeling they truly have an appreciation and love for you when they positively respond to you.
That cat looks high as balls
Marry him immediately!
Ditch your boyfriend, you are the chosen one!
I'm not really a cat guy but when they sit like that it's beyond adorable.
she's looking at him so seriously. She will get your ma . Hehehe
Ah the look of pure bliss on that cats face. What a cutie!

OUR boyfriend!
Handsome cat...
There‚Äôs no better feeling in the world then knowing your cat approves of your person. :)
So cute
I want a pet üò≠
Secrets to getting a cat to like you:

* Sit still-ish
* Don't try to grab them
* Be warm or put a heating pad on you
* Ignore them as they are settling in - just let them do their thing
* Acknowledge them only after they acknowledge you
* Take a quick nap with them. Sleep-bonding is a real thing.
r/catsmirin
Approval from the cat means he‚Äôs a keeper
It‚Äôs a sign. Either he‚Äôs a keeper...or he‚Äôs evil!
Shiit homie this catnip strong as fuck man you got anymore

Aww! He looks just like my [Seamus](https://i.imgur.com/vxgVtl5.jpg)!

Pretty sure my cat D‚ÄôArtagnan loved my ex more than me. My ex who claimed he hated cats. And then I‚Äôd find them napping together.

To be honest I almost gave him the cat in the breakup bc they loved each other so much. But I figured he wouldn‚Äôt want anything reminding him of me... 
but I also feared if I offered he would take him. And I love my little musCATeer. It was a tough internal debate.
Is he a jew?  His nose looks jewish.

Is your boyfriend Casey Neistat?
 absolutely adorable. He must be a keeper as all animals have a sense who's a good person and who is not.
Does he also give you the  "don't touch my man" glare? My cat does. He sits on my mans lap like that and gives me the evil eye and cries if I get affection from him.
It is a cute picture, but I always notice how people project their own feelings through cats.  I've noticed it repeatedly.

But your bf does look adorable.  Can't say I blame you.
