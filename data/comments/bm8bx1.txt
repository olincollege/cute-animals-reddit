My friends and I did the same to a baby squirrel that fell out of a tree (they did everything, I was just there to be there). Really cool, but you gotta let them go after a few weeks, they get some claws and super fast/hyper.
That's adorable.
Cute. If the squirrel stops playing, tell your dad to let him "win" sometimes. There's a famous research about rodent play and laughter in rats. The rats will prefer to play over food as long as they each get to win while wrestling part of the time.
Lady I work with rescues squirrels. Always has 3 or 4 on a bottle. Her arms always look like she got whipped with barbed wire. Pretty scratchy.
The most impressive thing is how he can eat such an unripened banana
We had a squirrel that became friendly to our family when I was a kid.  That lasted a few weeks and then one day he attacked my dad when he was sitting on his shoulder.  So they packed him up in a box to take to the vet to test for rabies.  The squirrel escaped from the box at the vet and ran into the woods to never been seen from since.  I always wondered what happened to Buddy the squirrel.
Jorah Mormont, is that you?
Your dad is kinda hot.
I rehabilitated some squirrels. I ended up getting bit multiple times and having to get antibiotics
I want a pet squirrel. I like squirrels
Yo that‚Äôs a hot dad bod right there.
more shirtless dads please
What's your dad do for work? He's in good physical shape for his age. What do I gotta do to have those ripped ol' man arms later on in life?
My dad just gardened and golfed. Your dad wins.
Is your dad the Onion Knight?
Is your dad Ser Davos?
At first glance this looked like a clip from ‚ÄúCastaway.‚Äù
Finally the son he always wanted
I actually found myself awwwing at your dad's face more than the squirrel!
your dad is Tom Hanks?
That is the sweetest thing I've seen today, and I've seen some sweet stuff today. Sugar, for example.
Wilson the squirrel?!

WILSON!!!
Are we just gunna ignore the fact he is doing this while eating a crunchy banana and might not be wearing clothes.
Your dad is a treasure, he must be protected at all costs
That banana doesn‚Äôt look ripe yet.
Your dad looks like Tom Hanks in cast away.
Can someone please tell me how this is really bad for the squirrel and it is gonna have a heart attack and die from this? I am sure something has to be bad when a video this wholesome is posted. Don't fail me reddit!

In all seriousness, that is adorable.
This is delightful, can't tell who is enjoying this more.
My wife and I raised an abandoned baby squirrel. Hands down the best "pet" I've ever had. The huge downside is, they chew on EVERYTHING.
His expression! He‚Äôs so freaking happy and so is the squirrel.
[deleted]
That is so cute. Tell your dad he's a lucky man for that friendship. Very special.
Somedays I just wish life be like that all the time. I mean, imagine being able to walk down the street and squirrel bro just wants to hop a ride to the next area, or you're riding your bike and bird bro just wants to sit for a spell, you're off hiking in the woods and bear bro just wants a hug or snuggle...

&#x200B;

Like, why's nature gotta be so metal? 

&#x200B;

For the most part I think over-all we've somewhat gotten city dwelling animals to a point where most of them are less afraid of us but still not to the point I can just be like "ey, squirrel bro! come hang out over h'mere!"
squirrels bite really hard too, when they want. so that play fighting is super adorable
The sheer joy on this man's face just made my day.
This is magical, thank you for sharing
My dad made friends with the backyard squirrel and Blue Jays (Retired people things). He stopped being friends (His name was Frank) with the Squirrel because he would take the peanuts and destroy all the plants and grass trying to bury them. They aren't on speaking terms currently.
Your dad seems really cool and it's amazing he's gained the love and trust of this squirrel, but you need to tell him that banana needed a few more days before it was ripe ijs
natures little tree dogs
Your dad is a very handsome man!!
Good to see Ser Davos Seaworth living a good wholesome life after the Long Night.
Your dad is hot, I'd like to call him daddy. Woof.
https://youtu.be/zlPQJ7qIyyQ
this makes me so happy. my parents are surrogate human parents to our tree squirrels, and i gladly accept them as my little siblings üòÇ
Retirement goals.
That‚Äôs a ripe ass banana
Thank you for this.
I hope I find a squirrel that wants snacks, pets, and is "ready to rumble" (and yes...  you just read that in your head with Bruce Buffer voice) when I retire. This is awesome.
You should get your dad a ripe banana
I think your father is a Disney princess.
Your dad is good people.
My mom's not retired but my dad is a veterinarian and she always used to raise the baby squirrels people found and brought in, Squirrels never really forget where they were raised it seems, yet they always forget where they hide their nuts
You Dad is a goddamned American hero! hearts
Something, something, your dad‚Äôs hot.
Your dad looks like a dad
Tell your dad and his squirrel that they're awesome.
Rabies in 3, 2, 1.
Davos gets killed off and retires with the squirrels....
Now that‚Äôs how you do retirement. He looks truly happy.
Wait what? You‚Äôre dad is retired? He looks so young with those guns!
Just give him the damn banana
A wise woman wrote:
See animals know gratitude and can show reciprocity this is why I don't tolerate ungrateful humans.
This is one of the cutest things I've seen in a while.
This so wholesome!

How many times has the squirrel won?
Fun fact about squirrels: scientists have recently discovered that they are closely related, genetically, to whales. It is believed that squirrels may have once been water creatures.
I‚Äôm so happy it comes back :) I saved a squirrel once too, but as soon as it was healthy again, it darted out as soon as I opened the door.
Ser davos got his fingers back
All my local squirrels are pretty much the standard grey variety but just today I got a crappy picture from my SO where he spotted a white one. 

We did have a neat one once hanging around that was like tortoiseshell. I called him Reese's.
This guy is living his best life and I‚Äôm fucking jealous.
I always wonder if the squirrel knows whats happening. Its not running away or actually fighting for its life so it knows its just play right?
Damn, he should be careful. I was feeding a squirrel by hand once and it must‚Äôve mistook my finger for food because it took a huge chunk out of it. There was a lot of blood.
Is your dad Jorah Mormont?
If you could feel the joy this brings to my heart :)
So your dad is a disney princess :D
Your dad is Tom Hanks?
Just gimme the fecking banana already for feck sake.

Theres only 2 people who can tame squirrels and that is dads and crack heads and it's an amazing talent.
This almost made me tear up lol, unsure why
I want a pet squirrel! <3
I'm glad Ser Davos managed to find happiness after all the shit he's been through.
Didn 't even know I need that.

Now I do.

Thank's a lot.....
Videos like this distract me from really bad depression and mental illness. Thank you for posting, it's heartwarming.
Retirement goals right there
Your dad is a Disney Princess now
Squirrel used Jump attack! 

It was super adorable!

Squirrel has won the battle
Thats great you helped and glad your dad is trying to great things but in no way is that squirrel rehabilitated. The whole point of rehabilitation of a wild animal is for its release into the wild to act as a wild animal and an important part of that is a healthy fear of humans. During rehabilitation it‚Äôs important to have little to no human interaction. What you have there is a pet squirrel not a rehabilitated squirrel.
This put a huge smile on my face!
 ‚ÄúYou f\*cked with squirrels, Morty!!‚Äù
Out of all the animal things I‚Äôve seen on Reddit, this is my favorite.
[removed]
He kinda looks like Iain Glenn (Jorah Mormont) a little older.
Sort of like Peapod for Bob Ross.
My dad has told me stories of him when he was around 10 years old, that he rescued a dying squirrel baby from birds attacking it. 

He keeped it for half a year until he set it free at a camping site. He went by sometimes and was told that the people camping there experienced his squirrel jumping around their tables. 

He still talks about from time to time.
Smell my farts and enjoy them!
Sir Davos, the Squirrel Knight
I needed to see this today. I literally just got a flat tire after avoiding a squirrel at the last minute and going up on the curb. everybody has told me that I was crazy for doing that because what‚Äôs another dead squirrel vs. now I am out hundred bucks or so because I need new tires. The joy this man has in this video is worth it.
Squirrels are just tree rats. Change my mind :
A squirrel once ate my finger.

I harbor a lot of resentment towards them since.
Someone tell Idubbbz
Love this! So so cute!
My buddy at work found a baby squirrel and rehabilitated it and two years later she still comes to see him on the porch every morning and evening.
I play fight with my SO's rats like this and they love it. She and her two girls pamper and pet them (and feed them ridiculous feasts of goodies - healthy, but omg), but sometimes they just want to rough-house around a bit and so when I come over it's serious playtime.
It's so fluffy I'm gonna die!
"Was" retired you mean? He now has a full time job as animal rescuer
Ser Davos retires to play with and rehabilitate squirrels
You may tell your Dad I love him. And his little squirrel.
Love this, it is so good for the Soul to care, to love and especially to laugh. I love animals they love unconditionally.
That‚Äôs nice my dad left me
Sir Jorah Mormont seems to be having an ok time of it :)

Maybe squirrels will one day be like dogs in relation to humans when they realize they get food from us by being cute and friendly.

In the squirrels mind your dad is it's biggest rival in life. It comes back to square off and always leaves knowing it needs to better itself to one day defeat him! Aah transcendence will be so sweet.
Give that man a paint brush and a perm!
So damn wholesome

He‚Äôs a disney princess
How do you make my eyes leak?!?!
I can tell you just from seeing that small clip;  your dad is one of the good guys.
Love your dad's smile as he's playing with the squirell! So sweet :)
 By contrast a squirrel recently ate away most of the main wiring harness on my older truck. The dealer price for the harness alone was like $1400. About 3 weeks after it happened I was helping a relative get a lawnmower from my backyard and as we came around the side we bore witness to a squirrel ( In my mind it was the same squirrel ) being snatched by some huge bird from my front lawn. It was glorious.
ADORABLE.

Also, Jorah Mormont?
That's so wholesome, u/gochuckadick
Give that squirrel some onions, Jorah!
I'm sad for the day that squirrel doesnt come to play
How considerate of him to provide a banana for reference.
Is your dad Jorah Mormont?
Who eats bananas that green?
Jorah Mormont and idubbbz are collabing on the Save the Squirrels Initiative.

Great video. I‚Äôm so over watching those cats/birds catch them as they are released!
This is the most genuine form of love i have seen today!
I sure hope he doesnt give that squirrel rabies.
Why is you dad eating an unripened banana?
I love to see a man smiling like a kid. Everyone spends so much time being all serious.
Your dad is kind of hot.
Pure and beautiful joy. Fucking amazing.
Fuck traveling. I want to fight squirrels when I retire.
I wanna retire and play with squirrels :(
I'm a lot of jealous!

Your dad is hot.
My aunt saves a baby squirrel that was pushed out of its nest as a baby, in the middle of the winter. We later found out he was deaf so it makes sense why the mother mightve rejected him.

They kept him until he passed away from a seizure. They couldn't release him because he was deaf, obviously. He became good friends with their pit bull and he would ride on her back around the house. He was so frickin cute
Is your dad Davos Seaworth and Will Sasso at the same time?
"Give me the fucking banana giant"
he looks a lot like cast away tom hanks
Tell your dad I said hi ;).
Does your Dad want another kid? And would you like an older sister?
Your dad‚Äôs hot üòç
Damn your Dad is hot for an older guy hehe
I hope the banana is for the squirrel it doesn‚Äôt look very ripe for people. Also the squirrel is super cute. I made friends with a chipmunk at my parents house once and he would come sit on my lap and shoulder and let me pet him. One day he did this to my dad and it scared the crap out of him.ü§£
Awww but is your dad Jorah Mormont?
Your dad looks like if Jorah Mormont was in Cast Away instead of Tom Hanks.
My wife and I raised 2 squirrels we found as tiny babies. The male grew up to be an ungrateful asshole but the female squirrel was very attached to me and kept coming back to see me everyday for months until one day she didn't. I miss that gurl squirrel....
This made me genuinely smile.

Thanks stranger
DUDE, ITS ME, MAURA. So glad to see your fluff ball is doing well. I didn't know your dad loved squirrels!
Your dad and his new buddy are the cutest. That look of pure joy... <3
LAST DAY I COULD‚ÄôVE UPVOTED. I CAME IN THE NICK OF TIME OHH

Wait I just remembered that the limit is 180 days oof
No waayyy, I love it  üò≤
I loved him in Cast Away.
Jora go back to defending the queen !!!
Ever since I saw the video of the adopted squirrel purring I've wanted one as a pet.
Your dad gives me hope that maybe there is some merit to the existence of humans.
I thought that was Ser Davos, The Onion Knight.
That looks like so much fun lol
Mostly for snacks though.
Really enjoyed seeing someone just enjoy life like this. Makes me happy as hell.
What the hell, this is so cute
I‚Äôm literally so hard this is so cute I wanna go inside out
Ugh, so sweet

I'm seeing it, but I still refuse to believe it.
Awesome üòâ
Squirrel, you know it's true   
Ooh, ooh, ooh I love you
this is amazing!
Hate to say it but this is why we should stop exploiting animals. Because we love to see them happy and not sad.
I want to be a nature dude when I grow up a bit more.
Your dad looks so happy, like genuinely deep in the heart happy, good for him ü•∞
That banana's mad green, fam.
So nice of him to help the squirrel out. Now he got a little friend to chill out with
Your dad is a Disney princess
Give your dad a hug for me.  
This reminds me of my dad who had a pet squirrel when he was a kid, always loved them around.
Wow I've never seen a squirrel act like this with a person. I knew people can interact with them, but didn't know they like to play like this haha
Give me that banana, old man!!
Save the squirrels initiative?
Is he eating a green banana?
When you say rehabilitated, what do you mean?  This is awesome btw
This is so cool. My wife and I have been feeding a squirrel for the past year and it's really neat to watch him become more bold, but I think he's too wild to ever play with us like that.

The squirrel in this video behaves just like the rats I keep. They've been very well socialized and will often choose play over food, very uncommon for rats in my experience.
Alternative title that would make this NSFW - Shirtless man holding banana plays with his squirrel
I've seen a lot of racism happening today, so seeing this has given me a little hope for humanity.
This man has got it all figured out
Is your dad from Asgard?
Merle never came back to me
All I want is for someone to look at me the way he looks at that squirrel.
Awww
What a kind soul.
The laugh reminds me a bit of Eduard Delacroix from The Green Mile, and the fact that he's shirtless and playing with a small rodent only re-enforces that link :)
That squirrel probably thinks it‚Äôs fighting for it‚Äôs life over turf and food lmao
I wonder what animals think when we play with them like this. 
Do they realise that we are playing with them and that we're not just big loud monsters. :P
IS YOUR FATHER EATING A GREEN BANANA?
Aww that's love.

I bet its an irish squirrel
While this is awesome, tell your dad that squirrels can carry rabies, very low chance though.
I rehabilitated a squirrel and it was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. Play fighting with a squirrel is incredibly fun, and I remember every day coming home from school when he'd run down the railing on the stairs and jump up on my shoulder to greet me.

However, like all wild creatures eventually it's time for them to go out in this great big world. Granted, he'd always come around for peanuts each day. And he raised a nice healthy family!

We ended up moving, but I left a whole two bags of peanuts for him. Miss the little guy.
Traitor! Squirrels are for the dogs to chase away from bird feeders!
Can‚Äôt wait till I retire. Pffff ya right
he still eats meat, right?
Aww, so cute
My step-grandfather had something similar with the chipmunks that liked to raid the walnut tree in his front yard.  They weren't as playful, but they would come up to you if you sat still, and let you pet them.
All fun and games till he get rabies
Do you want rabies? Cause that‚Äôs how you get rabies
Alcoholic squirrel s are a real menace.
Thank your dad for the great video and also for providing a banana for scale.

Oh my God. This makes me so happy! And then seeing your dad's face while he plays with the squirrel...even better! So jealous!!

How the hell do you get a squirrel friend I want one!
I rescued a squirrel a 7 years ago. His mom abandoned him on the ground. We think she was switching nests. We wait until nightfall for her to come back but she never did. He was about 5-6 weeks old. Kept him for about 4-5 weeks and let him go. He never came back for pets but he would come up to the door and scratch it to let us know he was out of treats. I‚Äôm sure I have his great grandsquirrels running around in my yard now.
I love this.

If my retirement isn't like this, idk if I even wanna retire
I had a baby pet squirrel as a teenager!

Its mom had made a nest in our chimney, but didnt come back so we adopted him until he was large enough to fend for himself. 

His eyes were still closed when we got him, and we had to feed him with a syringe. 

We started leaving him outside for longer and longer until he eventually stayed out overnight, and gradually left less and less food for him. 

 https://imgur.com/QFuiXI0.jpg
‚ÄúI looked out the window at the squirrels and they were merry.‚Äù
Serious question: isn‚Äôt there a high risk of getting an infection or disease from the squirrel if it bites you?
I thought that banana was a bird for way too long.
Cutest damn thing ever!
This is what joy of life looks like.
That is one green banana
EEEERRRRrrrrr MY Gawd! SO cute

Cast Away 2
It‚Äôs all fun and games until someone gets rabies!
I've raised and released back five squirrels in my life. Just a note for anybody who finds an orphan, if you're planning on raising it to let it go back into the wild, try to find the wildlife rescue people in your area and adopt another of similar age, preferably of opposite sex, to raise together so your squirrel recognizes what he/she is and will socialize with other squirrels.  But no matter what they, or rather, the females stay around and visit. We had one raise a few litters in our garage.  Males eventually find new territory.
Reminds me of the squirrels in 'The Sword In The Stone' üêøÔ∏è
r/MadeMeSmile
I would just like to point out that squirrels carry rabies. So if he gets bitten accidentally while playing, it would be worth it to get vaccinated.
I listened to the Game of Thrones intro 80's remix when I saw this, fits perfectly!
Very cool
Is your dad the child of Ser Jorah + The Mountain?
"MOM ! CHIP SMELLS LIKE HUMAN AGAIN!!!"
I've rehabilitated squirrels before. They were so much fun. Once we released them into the neighborhood they'd come back to spend time with us. I'd walk outside and they'd jump onto me like I was a Disney Princess.
Did he name the Squirrel Wilson?
Need to let that banana ripen abit my man

Your dad looks like present day Brian Bosworth lol
My gf found a baby squirrel with its back leg bitten off. None of the rehab center's had room and none of the local vets could assist her. My gf ended up driving across multiple states to get the remaining stump surgically amputated, vaccinated, antibiotics ect. We now have a big cage that goes from the floor almost too the ceiling (3 different levels) and she seems like the happiest squirrel in the world. The squirrel absolutely loves my gf and climbs all over her. Its fairly indifferent toward me but likes when I give her an almond.
Your dad is Ser Davos?
Is your dad Jora Mormunt?
"Gaahhh! Give me the snacks old man!"
Would be cool if one day it brought it's kids too.
thanks! best thing i have seen in days!
Ur dad is jorah mormont? Woah.
That's a great thing he has done.
"The squirrel comes back daily for snacks, pets, and **fights.** "

Yo, is your dad secretly running some sort of woodland critter fight club or something?
Lovely
That banana is not ripe yet.  What a savage!
I want a squirrel :-(
See, we all can get along
Aww this is so cute
That‚Äôs cute but the banana he‚Äôs eating is still green
Does the squirrel have a name?
Wow that's pretty sweet . Thanks for sharing mate
This looks like the awesome sequel to Castaway
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxQAB5C3Glo) shows a wild gibbon visiting an old man for company every day. Watching your dad and his squirrel reminded me of the gibbon video.
 Tell him to keep his other pets inside when he finally says farewell to this little hoss.

That made my day! Thanks for sharing
That retirement dream.
Thank you, you're a good man.
Thanks for this, I really needed to feel something other than hate today.
In the older days people use to have squirrels as pets apparently.
the other squires think its so brave.
It's always astonishing to me how trustful small animals are.

If a giant did that to me I'd shit my pants every time
That is awesome! 

Step 1 Tell him to befriend some birds, preferably crows. 

Step 2 Teach one or two that they get treats when they bring dollar bills. 

Step 3 ???? 

Step 4. Profit & take over the world with your bird/squirrel army.
That's so coolü§îü§îü§î

Seriously, adorable video.
Your dad is now unretired and a butler to a squirrel.
This is probably adorable, but I can‚Äôt pay attention to anything but how green that banana is.
That‚Äôs great :) if he‚Äôs going to continue to rehabilitate wildlife I would suggest a rabies vaccine just to be safe. It‚Äôs not always obvious if an animal has rabies, and humans often don‚Äôt show symptoms until it‚Äôs too late.
Hhhhhhh
Your dad is now officially a Disney princess.
Nice vid, u/gochuckadick
Your dad looks like Ser Davos
This.
That is like the retirement I hope for.
Love this.
Sleeping Billy-Bob
Ser Jorah lives!

Please.
Fucking superb
I could literally watch this all day.
That is so awesome
10/10 would fight this squirrel.
WE WANT MORE!
This is great.
This is just too adorable üòç.
Wish stuff like this would happen to me ugh
Your father is Ser Davos ?
I just hope he doesn't come back with rabies one day.
Lol i was always scare from them it remember me rates I thought they are dangerous so I see play full when I see Again I‚Äôll run to play :)) but nice dad lol

I love your Dad. Can he come rehabilitate my foster kitten? He is partially paralyzed, and I‚Äôm really bad at playing with cats so I just let my other two foster kittens do it for me.

Awwwwww!!!!!
Is...is your dad a Disney princess?
It's the simple things..
That's what commonly referred to as a rodent problem.
I'm concerned with how green that banana is....
This is AWESOME!
Anyone here country enough to have heard of squirrel stew? üêøü•ò
Who comes back for fights?
This is the single cutest thing that has ever existed we can all rest well knowing that we as a race have achieved true greatness
Thats awesome. Twitterpated!!
Your dad is a Disney Princess ‚ò∫Ô∏è
For some reason this made me tear up some. Your dad is a good human
Retired dad doing retired dad things. The world in balance.
Scenes of Juror in heaven after dying protecting Danny
This made me smile :)
This is so pure and adorable.
I genuinely thought squirrels are dangerous
the mutual joy makes me so happy. good on your dad dude.
Wow that squirrel has some big nuts.
Me even after reading the title: That‚Äôs a real squirrel!
Sir Davis after his GoT days
Its all fun and games until RABIES.
Priceless!
That banana is still green...
I helped a spider out of a glue trap. Hopefully it does not come back for a snack.
Squirrel is a dog
That's s cool! Wish I could pet my local squirrel these NYC squirrels are anti-social.
Bro that banana is green af.
Banana for scale
Well god dam I can‚Äôt wait to retire
I wish had a squirrel as a friend.

Or just a friend, like that squirrel.
This made my day üòä
Living the dream of retiring in a home with a pet squirrel
OMG SO CUTE!
Your dad reminds me of Rich from Survivor
It's so cute, but my first thought is "What about fleas, lice, or rabies?"
Disney Princess!
My dad is retired and is at war with the squirrels. Sorry but they attack his bird feeders. They are mostly winning but the war is actually kind of cute because my dad isn‚Äôt all about killing and scorched earth shit.
Livin the dream
I‚Äôd like to play with your daddy
Is no one concerned with how green that banana is..
Reminds me of when Robin Williams got sucked into Jumanji and came back after the kids resumed the game.
Is this a Dad thing? My Dad does this with my Cockatiel. This is weirdly similar to my Dad.. what.
He is my hero.  My wife makes fun of me for making noises to get their attention and feed them.  But he is at expert level by playing with them.  Love it!
Awesome. Your dad is now half Disney Princess.
PLot twist: Your dad now has rabies.
OP Username doesn‚Äôt check out
Sir davos ?
This is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen all month.
R/animalsbeingbros
Okay, I‚Äôll be the one to say it. 


Your dad‚Äôs a fox.

I love this but has anyone mentioned the green banana he is munching on
Man that guy is Jack Nicholson

Your dad is the goat !

Geeze, I‚Äôm retired and not having nearly this much fun!
Your dads a legend
This might be the best thing I've ever seen.

Interesting how people keep saying this guy is old. He's maybe 50? His arms are better than most guys in their 30's.
When I was young, probably 10-11, I found a couple of baby grey squirrels in a nest that had blown out of a tree during a bad storm. I raised the brother and sister, from bottle feeding size to adulthood. After they had grown I decided it was time to release them so I brought them out to a large pine tree and placed them on it. They both scurried up about 10-15 feet and hung out for a bit. The male just went off on his way but the female sat and just sort of stared at me for a while. Finally, after my goodbyes I started walking off and the female hurriedly scurried down the tree and caught up to me and ran up my leg so in the end I kept her. She was a fun pet and would love to hang out in my shirt pocket when I played video games and whatnot but they poop constantly like a bird, though not as messy. It's funny to think about how much personality these small unassuming critters can develop when you spend time with them compared to how we tend to see them otherwise, just as little varmints that scurry about doing their own thing in search of food.
That is adorable! It also makes me a little sad. My wife and I saved a 3 week old squirrel and he lived with us for five years. He was my little buddy and he played exactly like that. Nonetheless, thanks for sharing! Made me smile a bit..
Your dad is jacked.
Odd question for you, but I feel like I recognize those bird chirps from my childhood. Are you by chance in Northern Colorado?
He looks like Ser Davos
R/peoplefuckingdying
Conker Vs. Master Hand...make it happen Sakurai!!!
Just like Snow White
Your dad looks like the Onion Knight
Wholesome
Good Fother, I wish him Good luck .
Well, I'm an old woman, so this dude, he look plenty hot to me.
Someone bought a squirrel. Glad to see he got the right directions and didn't take the ‚Äùshortcut‚Äù.
Super late to the party but that's the most dad thing I've ever see!
I appreciate the banana for scale.
GIMME THAT FUCKIN BANANA!!
Feel free to share joy....i mean updates.
"The squirrel comes back daily for snacks, pets, and fights." Snacks, a hand he thinks has snacks in it, and wrestling  the hand he thinks has snacks in it. (Fixed it for ya).
And for giving rabies
He's so happy and I smiling for it.
But then one day he will not return T_T
Your Dad seems like a great guy. Retirement is a great way to discover your true self. Hopefully he will enjoy many memories like this one.
I guess your dad is a Disney princess now.
Awesome! I want a pet squirrel!
I haven't seen such peace in a video in a long time :)
Cute
It is almost enough to make me consider veganism.
He is happy because he is insane.
This is the cutest thing I've seen this year so far
This is the kind of stuff that keeps people happy, healthy, and young.
A banana and a squirrel, what else does a man need?
The pocket video is absolutely adorable. Has Sadie met the squirrel yet? If yes, how do they get along?
Amazing!!
Your dad looks like he was a racoon in a previous life and I mean that in a good way!
Pure happiness. Beautiful
Good on your dad! That's how a real man treats animals.
My own pet squirrel doesn't even treat me that good when we play. She bites the hell out of my fingers, almost to pierce my skin.
Your dad looks so badass
I‚Äôm concerned with the greenness of that banana
cute
So cute.
He looks like a pro at playing with that squirrel
I thought that was Tom Hanks in "Cast Away" from the thumbnail.
Creed bratton
OMG THIS MADE ME CRY HAPPY TEARS
r/fatsquirrelhate
My dad traps squirrels and leaves them for dead miles away from their caches during winter. Should I report this to someone?
Nothing beats a snack like a banana and rabies...
Squirrel wrasslin'!!
I love it.
That squirrel is gonna be leader of the forest one day. "Yeah, i used to practice fighting with an actual human every day"
Total DILF
That reminds me of me playing with my cat
Sweet.
Awwww üòç
What is his workout routine? You don't keep arms toned like that retired.
The squirrel thinks hes fighting masterhand.
Scrolling by and thought I was seeing a gif of Jorah Mormont eating a banana and playing with a squirrel. I‚Äôm still not sure that this isn‚Äôt what I‚Äôve seen.
Idubbbz in 20 or so years lmao
I dunno much, but try to get her to stay. She would be much safer this way.
Your dad looks like Chris Pratt
The only thing wrong with this is that he's eating a green banana....
Does squirrels have really quick reactions? Cause that little guy is fast!
hero
Until he gets a scent of a female and then it's, "so long"
He's so happy! That face
iDubbbz would be proud
This just made my day even better!
Does the winner get the banana?
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen in weeks. Thanks for that!
My heart is weak ‚ù§Ô∏è
That‚Äôs not a squirrel it‚Äôs a banana
Is Alex Jones ur dad?
Your dad is jacked
You're dad seems like such a great guy, i wish him a happy and long life :)
I just fell in love with your dad.
