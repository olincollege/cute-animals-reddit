It screams and eats at the same time
Proof that Nature abhors a vacuum.
Ft. Kitty stand‚Äôs final defense against the invading loud tower
I worked at an animal shelter once. Funniest moment was when a cat knocked the trash can over and it crashed to the floor.

The room exploded with terrified cats. Cats flung themselves from the towers, launched themselves into walls. They collided with each other and freaked out more, scrambling on the floor like cartoon characters before sprinting out the door. Cats in beds went from sleeping to leaping three feet away, flinging the beds in the air behind them. It took two seconds for the whole room to clear. 

I love those little weirdos
Where do they hide when it's time to vacuum the tower?


Similarly, when I volunteered at a small animal shelter, the second I reached for the produce fridge, the guinea pigs all started a mass chorus of squealing. It was always 30 minutes of "WHeeeeEEEE WHeeeeEEEE WHeeeeEEEE" until the food was put away.
The floor is lava 2k19
I‚Äôd hate to have to empty/clean the filter of that thing! 
This is how you make a Catmas tree.
I work in an animal shelter in Norway, trust me, same issue as here..
"Weight limit on a cat tree" suddenly sprung to mind.
The cat version of "put your feet up"
They will get revenge.  Oh, yes.   Laser cats will rise.
Also the cat family tree 
TO THE KEEP!

FALL BACK TO THE KEEP!

Its like me in a fire drill. 
Ah, yes, everybody staying at nearby apartments while the house is getting cleaned.
They sound like a thousand kittens screaming in an inferno.

Shop vacs and other sweepers and battery blowers are a portal to hell for cats.
After watching The Mummy (1999) on Netflix, I find it funny that cats are said to be the guardians of the underworld and that Imhotep runs every time he sees a cat. Little did he know if he just had a vacuum with him, he would have been just fine lol.
What if they all decided to attack at once? Would you rather fight one wet-vac sized cat, or a hundred cat-sized wet-vacs?
Same when I mop at my local animal shelter. The broom scares some of them, but the mop and the water strikes terror into all furry lil hearts
[deleted]
That's a damn nice animal shelter
That's probably the most fruitful cat tree I've ever seen!  Mine only bears one or two fruit at a time.
The dreaded Kitty-sucker-upper.
Funny story, our old family cat, Sundance, LOVED having her fur vacuumed.

If she was in earshot, she would come strolling over to get one.

I guess she figured out it got rid of loose hairs, and she wouldn't need to lick herself so much.
They probably hate the loud sound that vacuum cleaners produce, but most humans cannot hear that high tones
My cats aren‚Äôt afraid of the vacuum like most animals I‚Äôve met are. They literally just lay there in my way while I‚Äôm vacuuming no fucks given. 
Why are you using an industrial vacuumer? Even I would run away of those loud bastards, it might even has that vibrating automatic filter cleaner that sound like Satan is banging Mount Rushmore.
Somewhere in a parallel universe, 50 dogs are ripping a vacuum cleaner t shit

The floor is lava
Well you've got one of those gigantic shop-vacs. Those things are to normal vacuum cleaners what your mom is to other moms; way louder and you shouldn't use her indoors. 
I love how almost every single cat is looking at the vacuum like "fuck that guy".
Looks like Neko Atsume up in there!
Oh lawd, it comin'!
Haha, the Monster.

Well, when my cat even *sees* the *hand* vacuum cleaner' she's gone.
That‚Äôs the same cat tree my girlfriend has for her two cats.  And she thought it would be too crowded if they just got one more...
Oh damn I just got that exact cat tower for my little guy!

They aren't scared of Cheetah's, Bears or freaking alligators, but one sucky boi gets near and it's the ends of days with these furry bastards.
The council does not approve of that abomination. WE DO NOT APPROVE
So that's the secret to herding cats!
I took in a litter of kittens once. The first Time I got out the vacuum, all six ran and hid under a chair. But while vacuuming, the alpha, a bold lady kitten, came defiantly out from under the chair and walked right up to it and stared it down. She was not impressed. The other five stayed hidden. 
My dog is not fixed and thinks the vacuum is the perfect mate. Unless it is in use. So to recap vacuum off my dogs turned on, vacuums on my dogs turned off.
The evil vacoom! 
VACOOM the final boss cats need to fight for complete world domination.

Can we talk about your username here? That‚Äôs amazing. 
Op is dead. After vacuuming the cats descended on them to kill the operator of the loud scary machine. 
This is hilarious! Those poor cats are terrified, but what a great photo op!
TIL how to herd cats. 
As bad as it would be, it would be endlessly amusing to move the vacuum closer and see how they all run.

I was hoping to see a dog at the top 
When you‚Äôre just trying to help your pets and they are convinced you are the the devil and you have come to take them to hell.
I miss my cat...
I'm surprised they let that many cats together. I'm sure they're all spayed and neutered, but a lot of cats would fight with each other.
I work at a sizable rescue/daycare, so we have to use a huge vacuum. We put all the dogs in another pen, but they still freak the fuck out.

I love em, and I love working there, but hearing a   bunch of big dogs jumping against the fence is stress I didn‚Äôt know was possible
Of course the vacuum is one of the loudest, most horrible sounding vacuums made.
It doesn't have a muffler!
I pretty much came to the conclusion that if you just evolve making the vacuum noise you can scare off any predators 
hahaha
Catmas tree .... 
So many cute cats!
Lol that is so cute
Would a vacuum be effective against a lion or tiger attack?
You‚Äôve successfully herded cats. Congratulations! 
I have this same cat tree, good thing I don‚Äôt need to worry about the sturdiness of it 
I wonder if it's an evolutionary thing. Someone in another post was saying that their cat would love it when they played, but made faces when they played a sour note. Maybe the vacuum does that on a larger scale.
I have that same cat tree! My cats love it
But if you put a box next to the vacuum cleaner, which one would win? Is the attractive force of a box stronger or weaker than the repellent force of the vacuum?
Tree of Nope.
I was wondering where you got a picture of my house. Noticed one of the marmalades was missing tho so can't be me.

I was told herding cats was challenging.
Looks like it's time to harvest the cat fruit.
Why a catastrophe! 
This is how you learn which cats are deaf.
Looks like the cat tree is finally bearing fruit. 
I want them all 
All they need is a coupla Roombas and they guys will all be waiting in line, taking turns riding the room clean
TIL: Herding cats is possible. It just requires a vacuum. 
Thats the thing that took jimmy away...
What a magnificent cat tree. Looks like it‚Äôs in full bloom this time of year.
Man cats do grow on trees. 
Just popping in to say I have the same cat tree. Find it on chewy, it‚Äôs cheap, sturdy as all hell, and easy to assemble!
I used a broom at our shelter, didn't scare the cats.
I worked at the SPCA doing exactly this, half the cats hated it, the other half kept getting themselves stuck to it. And we had a steam cleaner that a couple of cats would ALWAYS FUCKING STICK THEIR FACES INTO so I had to be extra careful not to burn their dumbasses.
That poor kitty not on the tree
New meaning to cat tree. 
r/bossfight 
Oh the smells
Who else had to zoom in to realise there WASN'T a black dude sitting with the cats smiling at the camera by the bottom of the tree to the right?
/u/dipsta 
A vacuum cleaner would be a perfect pet Halloween costume.
So that's how they get the pictures of cats using the cat walls and not just ignoring it to sit in a cardboard box.
That last cat on the right taking no shit
is that cat house???

Introduce a laser pointer into the mix and watch them as they evaluate "get red dot" vs "ignore loud sucky machine" in their heads over and over.
Reestablishing dominance on the cat-human hierarchy with a little help from the vacuum.
Cats at the bottom looking up like Mufasa and the floor is lava.
What more do you need than this picture to prove that life just sucks.
Not sure if I want to see the contents of that vacuum, or if i never want to see the contents of that vacuum. 
Funny
I love how they all have varying degrees of distrustful looks on their faces.
Can I adopt all these kitties plz 
To their defense that is a scary dude
Nope. I trained my babies to love the vacuum cleaner.  When they were itty bitty,  everytime I brought out the vacuum, I would give them loads of cat treats. Called them vacuum cookies.  Now,  whenever I turn on the vacuum... they follow me waiting for vacuum cleaner cookies.  
They look absolutely crushed when someone else cleans and they don't get cookies...
Aww, poor little scaredy cats
Imagine those were a group of spiders or s huge insects, it wouldn't be that cute then huh ?
That's what kitty nopes look like
A shop vac is to cats as a Dalek is to Dr. Who.
OMG!  Too  much!  I love each kitty!
Omg ADORABLE
I think I know the type of place I'll get my high school volunteer hours at... 
I wonder if the more dominant cats get the spots on top
Crazy how such a powerful beast has in a way devolved and evolved at the same time.   
Strength in numbers!
The fact they're all on there not trying to push eachother into it shows a common enemy unites us all.
Awww. My babies also hate the sucky monster.
That must be satisfying
r/cats
I had a cat who **hated** the vacuum. It being out of the closet was enough to send him running. He would hide for hours or a full day, even, after every time I had to use it.

I swept the carpet a lot to avoid scarring him whenever possible.
I have that cat tree
a kitty christmas tree!
Lol
The scardiest scardey cat is on top.
Off topic, but how you make them all poop on only one place ? I have 3 and they poop in all my backyard...I cant make them do their things in just one place
The place I volunteer at, they never vacuum. Not because they hate vacuums but because it‚Äôs not given as a task. 

One of my friends decided to go crazy with the cleaning because we were shut down for awhile twice in a span of a few months because of illness. There was so much fur on the cat houses it was ridiculous. It was enough fur for an entire cat.

Then we spent an hour try to clean off these black marks from the ground. Somebody donated a giant hamster wheel that all of the kids try to use. It‚Äôs like 4 feet tall. They basically broke it and it was rubbing on the floor for awhile. Everyone gladly wants to get rid of it, but we don‚Äôt know where. 
I don‚Äôt see any carpets tho!
That's how it would look at my house while vacuuming too
So that's how you herd cats
I have that exact same cat tower 
I‚Äôm honestly very curious as to how much hair is in the vacuum 
It's gotta smell like cat piss in there
I'd love to pet all of them
Cat tree of life 
Now try with ten Roombas.
I feel blessed to have cats that don‚Äôt super fear the vacuum. They just sit in the bathroom watching because they know it won‚Äôt go there. 
The fruit is plentiful this year
*my house.
You have a great username
I want that cat tree. 
Cat : let's band together ! 
"everyone it's back!"
fruitful cat tree u have there
Aren‚Äôt they all over there because there‚Äôs a climbing frame?
This is the ultimate tower defense
Reminds me of Zefrank1
10/10 would work there in a heartbeat 
At least they‚Äôre being cautious 
In the voice of "The Kurgan", "Here kitty, kitty"!


And that, folks, is how you herd cats.
that vacuum cleaner looks like a robot from starwars 
As an animal lover, this is discomforting. Those vacs really SCREAM. I cannot use one without earplugs, and I am half deaf anyway.
Still, cleaning for these guys is HERO.
The cat on the top on the 1st picture looks like it's standing on the below cat's tail.

Looks about right 
Fantastic opportunity 
I've never seen a cat tree bear so many fruits!
I want a cat tree like that for my cats... anybody have a link?
To think, they might be all protective of their spot on the tree but as soon as the vacuum comes out they‚Äôre making room for each other. 
The Arc before its departure (colorized) 
First word that came to my mind : Dalek
And people say you can't herd cata.
"The dragon has returned! Quick! Hide your valuables under you!"
Why are you vacuuming instead of sweeping? 

We would never scare the shit out of the cats at our shelter unless absolutely necessary 
Is the cat at the bottom of the second picture missing a leg?
Needs more JPEG
I'm the asshole who would feel the sudden need to vacuum the thing they are standing on
Good thing my kitty is deaf. Well, not when I'm trying to get her attention. Then I have to wave at her.
I counted at least 22
All fear
# vacuum 
Day 32, the vacuum is still on, but the castles defenses are holding up
I always thought it was weird that my cat gave zero fucks about the vacuum. Slightly startled by it the very first time then just walked up to it to investigate it lol.
Now I know how to herd cats!
Just FYI
If you work or volunteer at an animal shelter and they do not use pine pellet bedding litter (the kind that‚Äôs meant for horse stalls) it‚Äôs extremely cheap and cuts the work of cleaning the litter box in half, because the urine is absorbed by the wood pellets, and all you have to do is pick out the poo which is usually the minority of what you have to clean up.
Where I live it‚Äôs eight dollars for a 40 pound bag, if you buy it from a feed supply shop that carries horse items.
The urine breaks down the pellets into sawdust, and so when it‚Äôs mostly sawdust is when you dump all of it and replace it with new pellets.
Love this photo
Looks cat-astrophic! 
You ppl talking about scaring the cats and how they run when a vacuum is on. Don't humans do the same ? I know my husband does ,he says it scares him and he just can't bring himself to vacuum the damn floors.. He looks just like the cats ,up in a tree..lol
Animals never went to space. They are too afraid of the vacuum.  
wanna take like half of them home
It is the destroyer of peace and odor! Fear the angry titan in the service of humanity and despair, kitteh friends! 
Reminds me of that scene in "the birds"
We must unite against the machines my brothers!
Lol for some reason my cat, "Princess Leia" is not bothered by vacuum cleaner.  She will follow me around while it's happening or sit on love seat watching me.  Other cats I've had in past would run and hide.  Good post OP .  
Now try it with dogs
I want to be that kitty tower lol
Why vacuum a room with tile floor when it upsets kitty? Sweep you lazy monster !

it's so cute

Pretty sure that's not a vacuum but something you use to suck up water if your basement flooded.
A vacuum cleaner would be a perfect pet Halloween costume.
Am I mistaken, or did I hear that the squeal of a vacuum cleaner is, in large part, beyond human hearing but actually hurts the ears of cats and dogs, who can hear higher pitches?
üòπüòπ
They need more perches.  
Poor kittehs. Nothing some catnip won't help.

Low key though I like me a tree full of cats.

Little baby angels! 
Soooo many assholes.
Hilarious! Great photo! I‚Äôd love to see a video of it too. 
The higher the cat the higher their anxiety of the vacuum. 

Except that chibzilla at the bottom right, ‚Äúbaa, I don‚Äôt give a shit‚Ä¶‚Äù

Can relate. My two cats run for the hills (or cat tree) when the dreaded noise machine rolls in.

This is exactly what happens in my home when I pull out the vacuum. But it‚Äôs 2 little boys, a really big dog and a very grumpy fat cat. They all come together as one angry, scared team on the sofa. I‚Äôm pretty sure they are plotting my vacuum‚Äôs destruction during those sofa meetings. 
Considerate cats, they all get out of the way so that you can hoover the floor without dodging them. 
You certainly have enough white-hats at the job site!! Lol.

I have the same cat tree in a different color for our three cats. 9 out 10 would recommend, especially for the price. 
Shop vacs are the best.

Why would you vacuum instead of sweeping and dust mopping?? 
Every time i pick up the vacu√ºm my cat starts attacking it. After about 10 seconds of going berserk on the vacu√ºm he grabs my pants with his teeth and tries to drag me away from it. About 15 seconds later he runs away and hides like "i tried saving you but at this point i'm going to save myself. Good luck human, it was nice knowing you". I love my cat
Makes it super easy to vacuum.

Suddenly herding cats doesn't seem so difficult
The physical height of the play-thing is a scientific measurement for the level  scaredy-cat-ness.

There was a comic strip called Get Fuzzy that had a dog and a cat as 2 of the 3 main characters. The dog and cat were usually at odds with each other, but in their Halloween strip they both agreed that the scariest costume was someone dressing up as a vacuum cleaner.

One word'- 
Blowtorch 
Believe me, I fucking hate cats. But if that tree is the only place for the cats at that place to hide : the shelter needs to buy more shit.    
I hate cats. Yet I have one myself, she's from a previous relationship where she wanted cats and we compromised and got two. We split some time ago and one "unexpectedly" (according to my ex) passed away. And then I had to take the other cat. I'm allergic but because I for some reason agreed to get cats the cat that I have left is my cat. And she's fucking precious and I love her. She's the best cat.    
All other cats can die.
