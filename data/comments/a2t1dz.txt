Why is my tongue dry?

Why does it taste like fingers?

WHAT DID YOU DO CARL?
This is why cats have such rough tongues. Better for grabbing!

Ha! That is adorable! 

Am I the only one that expected the “fix” to be tongue in mouth, not more tongue out?

Just restart the cat and make sure you have the latest CatOS installed, and it should be all fixed.
"What's the matter, person got your tongue?"
Leave the kitty alone!
Turning a “blep” into a “mlem.”
lol. poor cat 
I use to do this to my cat. Funny thing is when she’s wake up she still had tongue sticking out for a while. I’d then poke it back in
Little Gene Simmons, right there.
My cat does this all the time!! Does anyone know why cats do this? I'm for real intrigued by this weird cat behavior.
Omfg 😍
I’m in love 
This might just be the first blep enlargement operation to ever be recorded on camera.
Soooooooo gentle!
I had this ghost feeling of someone pulling on my tongue watching that 
I cannot handle the cuteness. 
PUT IT BACK PUT IT BACK!

This is hilarious. But it’s so damned cute that it’s activating whatever hormones that control desperately wanting a kitten. Like baby rabies but with kitties. That little abdomen going up and down as widdle baby kitty takes widdle baby kitty breaths.  It turns my brain into sentimental mush, and makes me grab Siegfried VonKittykat to give him lots of hugs and smooches, which makes him give me that look that says, “what’s she on about now?? Another sad ASPCA commercial?”
You lil scamp
How cute
Someone gave their kitten valium
That’s one tired kitter!
:P
Omg, now how cute is that 
*secret zelda door opens*
Aww
Cat got your ton--  wait
WHAT ARE YOU EVIL HUMANS DOING TO US CATS
Revenge for when the cat got *your* tongue?
Human got your tongue?
I cant tell if the cat is still asleep or just doesnt care
Aha! Oh how the tables have turned! Who's got who's tongue now?!
I thought that was it's nose...
Oh dear God...........






















I think my heart just exploded.
Fluffy cats are the best! 
Why is it every humans reaction to this is too pull their tongue? I always do this to my English Bulldog. 
wow im having a shit day and this really turned it around.

Still found myself laughing under my breath (villian snicker) as to not awake that sleeping baby.
Some "cat got your tongue?" / "Got your cats tongue?" joke I'm too tired to think of.

Hope you wake up one morning with the cat yanking on your tongue just so he can show his fellow cat ...people....peers....peeps.
Am I in the minority that finds this pretty mean?
Haha! Love it! So cute
I laughed so hard TWICE! 
so cute!
might get crucified for this but I hate seeing people fucking with sleeping animals. Like dam let it sleep. Imagine your sleeping and you wake up to some one playing with your tongue? or their fingers in your mouth? give the living creature some space. I cant imagine being an animal, prisoner in a house with someone extremely clingy and annoying. "Oh its sleeping?! how cute! let me carry it, let me poke it, let me play with it!" leave it alone...
There's a special place in hell for people who mess with you when you're sleeping ...

Oh lord, that’s sweet!
What a cutie, Ohhhh this is why i want a kitten when i grow up
My cat used to do that sleeping also she did it when she was happy.
Well, why don't you just get a sharpie and draw a moustache and glasses on baby. Just kidding. I like to flap them up and down

This is also known as a forced blep.

I've yet to see a gif in which the person pushes the tongue back in. Why do we instinctively pull it out?

Little does everyone know, the cats dead.

I have seen this reposted several times and I've upvoted it every time because that is the cutest damn thing I've seen all week!
This kitten is asleep (obviously!) but cats do not actually sleep that much! Usually they are just resting (cat napping!) but for a few minutes they will properly sleep like this, they twitch and have their eyes slightly open and you can pretty much do anything to them and they won't wake up, not from noise, being poked or whatever (within reason of course). 

I don't know if all cats do it, but when my last one did wake up she would instantly look up, meow and run as fast as she could to her food bowl and stuff her face. Strangely though she wasn't a cat that nagged for food or anything otherwise, even when I was doing up her food mixing it to mush she'd just sit and wait patiently.   
I definately need this after browsing r/enoughinternet
I miss being a kid and going into a full coma where the sleep is so deep ... OMG I love this kitten.
My cat does this all the time!

cuteeeee
Gotta' wonder what you did to Kitty's dream....
I love smol cats
That's just mean.

I need bourbon to sleep this soundly.
when you open your mouth to sleep, it causes cavities because it dries up the ph level in your mouth.  Not enough good bacteria to protect the inside of your mouth.   
This is will bring world peace. 

Thank you.
Hey, man, i think your cat is broken.
Have some respect for your cat. It's not a toy.
Plot twist: Cats actually dead and that's why you can play with its tongue without it moving.
Aww that's one of the cutest things I have ever seen!
So cute!! Sleepy little blep ❤
Those early days truly are precious. 
I was surprised by this, because it was my cat.
