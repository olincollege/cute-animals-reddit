Just remember folks if you‚Äôre in a daring prison escape, always take a moment to stop and clean your face so you can look good while doing it.
Look this is cute and all, but we really need to start thinking about what landed this hamster in jail in the first place
The hamster is distressingly cavalier about being suspended above hot lava.  It took a breather to wash its face and I'm screaming at my phone BRO MOVE IT BEFORE THOSE CHAINS FAIL IT'S HOT LAVA YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO LINGER
That was tense
I would like 3 full seasons of this on my desk by tomorrow
I love it how the hamster is in zero danger and still I‚Äôm like ‚Äòhurry up, there‚Äôs hot lava!!‚Äô
Pucker factor: 10, thought he was done at the lava.
It's over 8 minutes long, no way I am watching this whole...wow that was clever...look at him go...you can make it little buddy! I watched the whole thing.
This was so well made, both construction-wise and editing-wise. The ladder climb had me in stitches
Prince of Hamsters: the Indiana Jones within.


Btw the whole setup is so impressive. Must've taken a lot of work and ingenuity. Kudos.
I love how he stopped for a quick bath during his prison escape. Very dramatic
That is simply fantastic! Is he called Indiana Hamster?
What an incredibly well cared for hamster ‚ô• Enrichment like this is so important for our pets
Brave Little Hamster
That was more intense than I imagined it would be!
Hamster up and vanished like a fart in the wind.
So cute! Had me on the edge of my seat a few times ngl
If Netflix doesn‚Äôt pick this up I‚Äôm canceling my subscription.
I've seen big budget blockbuster movies that are less captivating then watching this hamster run through an obstacle course.
In 6th grade I did a maze race between a hamster and mice as a science project to see who was fastest. I learned that the hamster was smart (or I was dumb) because he just climbed up and walked over the walls. 

Next time I'll make them taller.
I started the video, checked the length, and said "no way I'm watching an 8 minute video of a hamster solving a maze".
But I was wrong
I like to think that every time he cleans himself that he‚Äôs using a medpack to heal up or eating to regain stamina.
Hamdy Dufresne.
I need this kind of enrichment.
If anyone else who watched this entire video can explain to my wife why I take such long bathroom breaks I‚Äôd appreciate it
A better movie than Tenet. Engaging, sensical story, excellent action, great sound editing, perfect performance from main cast.  5/5
best video ever on this sub
Very high tension. Was very impressed when the hamster chewed through the bars, can tell she does her own stunt work
Didn‚Äôt know they changed the cast on prison break! Michael even got some of his hair back lol.
This is the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
Why does a prison security camera need to worry about battery life? I'm starting to think this might be fake!
Same hamster, same theme, another [video](https://youtu.be/b2xgiHVjT7o)
Whoever made this definitely works for Naughty Dog, no doubt

Also, someone should edit this with the MGS Alert Theme
That hamster is a superhero üëç
Go forth Lemmiwinks, or you will soon be dead!
This guys yt is Mister hamster for anyone who's wondering
This hamster must be so smart from all the brain cells it‚Äôs been growing due to running mazes
Something‚Äôs off about this whole escape setup... it doesn‚Äôt seem real to me.

I mean come on... how is a hamster going to afford a hot air balloon? How did he manage to acquire one in prison? This hamster clearly has some inside help. üßê
I bet all our human perils happen because someone watching simply craves amusement.
This hamster moves around like I do in an RPG, making sure I didn't miss any loot.
I have never found myself talking to a hamster in a video SO MUCH, yelling out things like "OH NO!" "NO!" "HURRY UP!" so many times! This is definitely an extra long bonus video, so many tricks, traps, hidden dangers, water hazrads, fire, and even scary looking snakes! Oh my! Best video yet! Thank you so much!!
Everytime he rubbed his head all I could hear was ‚Äúthink think think!!!!‚Äù
This! So cute.....I wasn't going to click when I saw how long it was but by the end of the video I was on the edge of my seat cheering him on..."Oh no! The ceiling is coming down! chew baby chew!!!" Best thing on Reddit today!
What amazed me most, was no hamster poop pellets!!
Now that‚Äôs fucking content!
Hello Hammy... I want to play a game.
Production quality was LEGIT.
That'll do hamster, that'll do.
The real question is, how did you cut so many perfect little circles??
TIL hamsters are actually liquid
I've never been so invested in a hamster before!
Just stupendous! The production was just out of this world and what can I say about our hero? Just a natural! Hollywood beckons! A shoo in at the Academy awards üòâ. Rumour has it, the next part has Leo dicaprio in a supporting role üòÇ
Looks like a half life level üòÇü§£
The amount of time and effort that went into this is amazing love it
do hamsters enjoy mazes?
That hamster had more exercise in 8 minutes than I had in my entire year...
This is amazing! I could totally see this becoming a random hit like the marblelympics.
This.  Is.  Awesome!  üëèüëèüëè
I love these videos. They are getting crazier lol. The hot air balloon escape
Well done üëè
This gives me heavy LittleBigPlanet vibes, especially with the arrows

ONLY 0.01% of hamsters CAN DO THIS!!!
Youtube:  Mister Hamster.  Whole lot of them there!
I swear this hamster has a higher IQ than I do
Catherine Zeta Jones dips beneath the lasers!!!
üòÜ This is way more entertaining than Wonder Woman 1984!
If you find this interesting you'll love the squirrel obstacle course Mark Rober made.

The only thing this is missing from achieving perfection is putting a mini Indiana Jones hat on the hamster
I cannot believe I stayed through that whole maze. I thought it was like a your trapped find the key. But that hammy is hella smart.
"Oh boy this is tough, let me wash my face real quick." 
I watched and enjoyed every second of this, thanks!
I was on the edge of my seat when the lil hamster was chewing the wires while the ceiling was caving in
Far more entertaining than the Wonder Woman movie.
THE CAKE IS A LIE!!!!
He should have written the channel name
Hey.... That wasn't a maze!
Anyone else remember that movie ***Dave Made A Maze*** from 2013 or so ?
I enjoyed it very much and would like to be a hamster.
I can not believe how extensive this hamster's journey is. Like for real, the hot air balloon ride was just a freaking segway.
Im much more impressed with the person that created this
Hamstershank Redemption
Hamster: no prison can hold me.
Are there any animals that are like hamsters but live longer
I used to think I was extra with my pets but this is a whole ‚Äònother level of ‚Äúextra‚Äù.  Like how much time did the owner take to make this crazy amazing maze and the sound effects and all the movements.  I love humans lol
Caging a hamster in a cell with a human toilet....you MONSTER!
Clever hamster! But I‚Äôm rather impressed by the patience and dedication of the person who did all that!
Everyone thinking this Hamster is a criminal when in reality he‚Äôs just one of those people who test out a prisons security system. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so nonchalant about this
Did I really spend 8 minutes watching a hamster complete a course??? Yes I did
Next, maybe try to not make it so easy and remove the green arrows

Sheesh.
You know you‚Äôve been in quarantine too long when ...
This hamster has now done in 3 minutes, more than I have in all of 2020
In 50 years, that hamster is going to lead nicolas cage in to alcatraz.
What are the little motors powering the movements ?
great job, u should direct the next ant man
‚ÄúPuny human and your stupid maze tricks...‚Äù
Huzzah Lemmiwinks!
Is this the hamster‚Äôs first time completing this jail run? If so then it‚Äôs pretty impressive lol. I‚Äôm always amazed how they can fit thru such tiny passages
I love how the hamster glances at the dead body and then just bolts.
Oh to be a hamster escaping prison
If this is a taste of 2021, I think we're going to be ok.
But that last room he goes into.. the exit shut behind him. He's now trapped in a windowless cell of his own making.
Better than WW1984
What type of hamster is this one?
8:33 minutes of my life I'll never ask for back. This is just great!
Having made multiple mazes and the like for my gerbils in the past, I'm most impressed by the fact the hamster continued to move forward, even if it was over multiple takes. More often, my gerbils would go "Oooh, a cozy spot. This is home now!" and just sit there.
I am amazed he didn't poop once.
First I thought there was no way I was gonna watch an 8 minute video. Next thing I know I am enthralled. That being said he never rrally escaped just found its way to the cafeterias motherload. 

I DEMAND A PART 2 AND THE NAME OF SAID HAMMY
I want you make one for me (not for my pet, for me)
Hamster Dufresne, the rodent who crawled through 500 yards of shit and came out clean the other end
Under new COVID restrictions, the board of health has deemed Escape Rooms to be a nonessential service. We suggest buying a hamster and building your own.
Love how hammy stops for cleanliness every few obstacles, so cute! Hammy is fastidious.
Best movie of 2020. Hands down.
This is what you get when a dungeon master misses having the party IRL.
I was ridiculously emotionally involved in the little guy finishing the maze.
There‚Äôs movies on Netflix with less production value.
I thought he was a goner at the end when the ceiling was droppingü•∫ super cute
Escape from MouseCatraz
That was really entertaining! Like hamster top ninja!
"We are sorry but the princess is in another castle. Please try again"
American Ninja Warrior Hamster!
This person has a very odd hobby. But, I would like to know if stuff like this really enriches a rodents life? Are they 'happier'?
How dare you use real lava on that hamster!
Ok serious question. Do hamsters enjoy these kinds of things? Obstacles and puzzles?
Fuck yea
This is too cute! Loved it!
This just made 2020 a whole lot better :)
The camera in the corner, lol!
This is amazing! Was getting major Scandal vibes in the beginning when the hamster was in the bathroom/sink area
This gave me new life. This is exactly what I needed to see today
This is the quality content I need more of.
I see GLaDOS is really exhausting her options for new test subjects
This Tango and Cash reboot looks weird, but I approve.
This would be a fun and cute video game
This is a remake of Half Life.
Wow genuinely the most impressive thing I‚Äôve seen in weeks
as a fellow legomaniac.. 

i see some lego mecanism    how cool is that !!
The amount of fun this Hamster had in the video is waaaay more than what I've had in 2020 so far
u/savevideo
This hamster escapes the maze the same way I play video games.


Progress forward, then immediately backtrack to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss any hidden goodies or Easter eggs
I want to know who took all that time to make a hamster maze.
Lemiwinks, you must escape this place or you will surely die.
Every cheek fluff he gives himself more motivation!
I have never been this invested in a video before.....
I thought this was footage of El Chapo
Awww my goddd I just love the way it takes its sniffler itch breakss
That is such a cute fucking hamster. I'm going to cry.
*Calmly stopping to clean itself while standing over a lake of fire*
Working from home I see
Gave me flashbacks to World of Warcraft dungeons.
Hampter
This is awesome. How many hamsters ~~died~~ were sacrificed for this video?
Not fair, that balloon should have took him wherever he wanted to, Not to another maze!
it always just said "subscribe to my channel" but what is the channels name? what's the source?
I love all the quality content we've seen this year thanks to people suddenly having way too much time. Thanks Covid.
Smart to try biting through the bars first.
He had a nervous twitch, he would scratch his nose, poor baby
This was THE most enjoyable thing I‚Äôve watched in ages! Thanks!
This is one of the best videos of all time
I just wanna see more of the good hamster enjoying his well earned prize
This may be the best thing I see on the internet today.
I was at the edge of my seat the whole time, especially when he almost got crushed trying to get through the bars. Well done. Thank you for the best christmas gift I received this year. :)
This is the most adorable, clever and amazing thing I've ever seen.
I like how you put arrows as if the hamster is going to understand them
Isn‚Äôt this like kinda fucked up?
Algernon!!!
I was hoping it would escape via the toilet.
Good thing he has all those arrows to guide him
Thanks for this video, I enjoyed watching this üòÇüòÇ
When are you releasing the squeaquel?
What a goddamn delight. Thank you!
This has better CGI than the Star Wars prequels
This is the greatest accomplishment of both hamster and humankind
This is fuckin amazing. Whoever did that - Ultra Max Pro A+
WHO would put a hamster in prison?!
I heard somewhere that he does all his own stunts
So fucking cute
Poor hamster.
This prison was designed by Black Mesa
Cool. I just wish it would have escaped through the toilet
This is one of the best things I've ever seen in my entire life.
Well reddit isn't gonna get any better roday.
We have better footage of this than of Jeffrey Epstein's escape.
I really just sat here for 8:33 and watched an adorable Hamster escape a maze.... ‚ú® IMMACULATE‚ú®
I received a $100 gift card to my local pet retailer. This video makes me want to use it on a hamster.
I was more invested in the plot of this than the entirety of the new Star Wars Trilogy.
The hamster after all of this:

What. The. Fuck.
OP you really should credit the channels you take things from
I was WAITING for the further adventures of Lemmiwinks!
"Oh, lava pit, lemme sit here and clean myself for a bit" Savage AF that lil' Hamham.
So hamsters are water too? Just like cats? These spaces that hamster fits through...
That butt wiggle going under the wall!

Hammy Dufresne, who crawled through $45 worth of cardboard and came out licking himself clean on the other side.
This hamster has had a far more interesting year than me
Chew Hard and the second part of the action movie is Chew Harder
I like the fact that he looks for things to loot before going for the next stage
I thought Prison Break finished already.  Maybe I missed a vital season.
This hamster must‚Äôve done some shit to be in that high of security prison.
Hamster having more fun than me
The person who designed this hamster maze was clearly inspired by those episodes of Star Trek where Kirk has to crawl through the inner bowels of the ship only to find molten lava.
How DARE you make your pet run across lava all for a dumb youtube video!! /s
They say pets need stimulation and activity.  This hamster gets both.
My kids is obsessed with these hamster maze videos. We watch them like people watch football games, lots of excited cheering!
Why was there an engine room next to a prison?

Not gonna lie! I thought I would just take a quick peak at this but it was too lovely to leave. The creativity and artistry here is gorgeous and fun. Thank you SO much for doing all of this work and making this to share. I really appreciate your skill and your keen sense of fun! Thank you!
I‚Äôm stoned and this was like watching a full-length action packed feature film.
So, this is what happens when you own a hamster and are stuck at home due to Covid.
Well, we all know what Richard Gere is doing while in quarantine.
That was ridiculously entertaining

He definitely deserved that reward!! Go hammy
This may be the best thing I‚Äôve ever seen on the internet.
This was absolutely brilliant! I‚Äôm exhausted watching it!
I like how they put mini Unus Annus references :)
You are brilliant! And your little hamster too!!! Thank you so much for sharing!  Looking forward to the day you're accepting an Oscar and reminisce about how it all began with a hamster maze!
Idk. I call bullshit

Am I the only one who saw all those arrows directing him the whole way through?

The Hamshank Redemption. "THE FLOOR IS LAVA!"

This actually got me anxious. Better than 98% of "thrillers" out there.
Why are the hot and cold taps the wrong way around on the sink? It's poor workmanship like that that made the sink fall off so easily in the first place.
This is probably the best thing I've ever seen on Reddit.

We really need a tv show for this.

Little guy's name is shawshank!!
I wonder why OP downloaded the video and uploaded it on reddits terrible player, when they could've just posted the [actual video link?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cu38F7beXj0)
Cool looks like a lot of hard work not that I‚Äôd want to scare hamster but snakes and spider only came out after it passed
Clearly I am not owning a hamster correctly.
This is amazing.
u/pkkballer22 you couldn't even link where you stole the video from? Unreal.
Someone has some time on their hands.
Didn't know I needed to see this, but I guess I did.  Funny thing is, I had sound off but was listening to ADHD concentration music, which made it kinda intense.
That was great!!

What‚Äôs the YouTube channel name?
Most satisfying 8 mins I have watched in reddit till now.
I have a few questions

1. What was this hamsters crime?
2. What kind of high security prison has lava? Like what sin did this guy commit? Lava's scary.
3. What high security prison has arrows telling an escapee what way to go?
4. Why did this poor dude get on a hot air balloon just to end up at another prison to escape from? Alcatraz on steroids.

All I‚Äôm saying is that at 5:05, that‚Äôs not how gravity works. Other than that, cute video! I loved it.
I never got to see Escape From Alcatraz, thanks for the trailer.
this is probably dumb, but does the hamster enjoy this?
I can just imagine the person recording this making sound affects while the hamster is like ‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing?‚Äù
Hollywood take some notes.
That‚Äôs adorable but wonder if he was scared ?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èthey get nervous and clean their face aww
He almost looks like a rotisserie chicken from the top.
Anyone remember hammy the hamster?
I just got a free award, so here have it
I think the ending was a bit overstretched imo. The best point of the ending would have been when he went up the balloon. Then it got a bit repetitive..

Amazing video though! :D

og video  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLzxrzFCyOs)
That was amazing
I just spent 9 minutes of my work day watching this hamster and I regret nothing
I was more invested in this than I was in my last relationship
Well now he's stuck in another prison, but with food.  At least he had a toilet before.

WORST ENDING EVER.
Came to be impressed by hamster, left impressed by maze maker.
You have your hot and cold mixed up....someone could get hurt! ;)
It‚Äôs a way out all over again
Its like looking in a mirror
Such a little cutie. The way he nibbled at those cage strings! üòÇüëåüèª. I was emotionally invested and was cheering for him all along!
Really cool! What a brave escaped convict.
Babe, if you need a pick-me-up. It‚Äôs a hamster in a jail break...
I was almost convinced this was real until I saw the string pulling the mining car.
Prison Break 2020 the hamster edition
Are there plans available for the maze?
This is why I Reddit.
Genious.
That's the most activated hamster ever. GJ!
I would really love an extreme version of this, really creative great engineering
Shawshank redemption starring hamster
No, Hamster escapes from PRISON.
I have mad respect for you guys that do this!! I mean it‚Äôs soo cute an funny to watch but my gosh the time you must put into making the set up is incredible the hamster is never in danger and I know enjoying the heck outa it an you know that you spend time with your lil friend it‚Äôs jus awesome to watch!! Kudos.. keep up the good work an love to your furry friends!! lol
Apart l from the adorable hamster, that maze is like a Rube Goldberg machine! Need to offer it up on an Etsy store or something. It‚Äôs epic!!
Didnt think they could make a sequel to A Way Out
Is this not real? I was so interested in seeing how he would climb the stairs. That sucks.

I‚Äôm so adding commentary to this video and sending you a DM - OP
Well, the quarantine broke *someone* and it wasn't the hamster.
Build quality is amazing! Very impressed.
This is baaicly Half Life 1
Same contractors for Bowser castles made this prison.
This made my Christmas. Thank you.
Better movie than Wonder Woman 1984
I just sat captivated. Laughed every time it stopped and cleaned itself.
Free my guy hamtaro
That thoroughly entertained my 2.5 year old! He even got all giggly and tensed up during the "heated moments".
But what did he do to wind up in prison? Maybe we‚Äôre cheering on a monster that bit his owners finger, ran off into the walls, chewed through all the internet cabling, and then orchestrated 9/11.
Lol my rock could have done this, no sweat
I love that this never ends. I could watch hours of this.
How is this hamster smarter than me...
B
Better than most movies
I don't remember _The Shawshank Redemption_ being like this.
The whole time I was singing "Go hamham, go hamham, go!" to the tune of Vanilla Ice's Ninja Rap.
This reminded me so much of Fightingforce 2 for the ps1.
Better than most Netflix shows.
One of the most satisfying videos I've watched. 10/10 what a cutie
Amazing major production. Props to the star and the creator(s). ‚ù§Ô∏èüëç
Aperture science
*ques MGS theme*
So this is the new thing for 2021: Hamster Escape Rooms
Nice
Is this the second one or is the other one part 2?
Its interesting to me that the hamster, when confronted with an obstacle that he must remove to get through, will remove parts and reassess instead of removing the whole thing.
I've been on tiktok a lot and I'm proud of myself for having the attention span to watch 6 minutes of this lol
Lemiwinks has come a long way
*Welcome to the Rock*
I love the Allen wrench pipes.
"I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged."
Idk if he would be able to do it without the arrow signs

FOR 8 MINUTES.
Black Mesa's employee of the year.
Escape the maze to a dead-end with limited food.
New escapist game looks great
Whoa the sound effects are nicely done
Never thought that I would watch a full episode of Hamtaro prison break live action
Ended too early.  Wanted to watch him eat
Kids, when your running over a bridge with blue popcorn under you, always stop to clean yourself so you look good while your at it.
The dramatic music makes the whole thing perfect
leeemmywinks !
This was better than GoT season 8
FREEDOM!
Better than the whole Escape Plan franchise
I envy the free time of others...
Wow, this was a full movie! Haha
Everytime the hampster wipes it‚Äôs face...

‚ÄúAlright, you got this! Game face! Game face! Ok, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù
I have so many questions...
I watched WW84 today, this video has a better production quality.
this needs thin lizzy jail break playing
What‚Äôs the YouTube channel? Can‚Äôt find it :(
Shawshank Rodentption
Is this Half Life 3?
Escaping lava filled maze is important, but stopping for a quick slick and groom is importanter.
I didn't know they were remaking Escape from L.A.
I am so glad I logged on to reddit.
That little dude is unstoppable
I'm too lazy to do it but this needs the Saw movie theme playing.
He‚Äôs the Lemmiwinks of the hamster world. So brave!
Foreshadowing season 2 of Alice in Borderland üòÖ. Awesome vid.
I love the part at 1:39 when it seems like a scene from a jak and daxter game
Quarantine has be tough
Very easy for him kkkkkkkkkk
Mesmerizing..üëå
One of the best things I've ever seen...
That maze feels a bit like 2020 üôÑ
Unrelated to the hamster, but the hot and cold on the sink should be reversed.
What did the hamster do and why is he in jail
Smart hamster you got there
What was he convicted for?
When he got on the air balloon that was it for me...
He did it üéâüéâüò≠
Better get Robo-cop to apprehend the escapee.
I love my hammy but he's dumb af and absolutely would never have left that first room.
Isn‚Äôt by any chance his name ‚ÄúEl Chapo‚Äù?
This hamster is indomitable. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you throw at it. It will prevail with a few grooming bouts thrown in.
Cute
That was the longest I've sat on the toilet for a video to end.
This makes me want to go play kz maps on CS:GO.
Stop freebooting. Just link to the youtube video.
our hamster is too lazy to escape anything haha
I laughed, I cried, I screamed... best video today, and I already watched Die Hard today.
This reminds me of Half Life 3
This looks like one of the fun houses that are in fairs and carnivals
Hamsters appear to be much smarter than I give them credit for. Either that or he runs these courses several times and learns them before they put this on video (I kinda expect the latter).
r/nextlevel
I love that the little hamster knew what arrows mean.
The new Mario Maker is looking dope
Is there a subreddit for Hamsters in mazes?
THE CAKE IS A LIE
I remember this HL1 map
But what was he/she in for?!
this is beautiful 

i‚Äôve looked at this for hours now.
I rooting for you little guy!
They don‚Äôt make prisons like they used to
So damned cute my heart could burst <3 

Subscribed :)
Over what period of time was this made? I have a feeling it was done in segments.

Looks like a fun project though for those trapped inside during the pandemic.
Fake! Not one Hamster poo /s
Smart lil Hambone
Interested
7:30 had me screaming
That creator (https://youtube.com/channel/UCVOBACU6Fn9REoL3uN5fWpA) has a cute sense of humor.  The little Lego skeleton was barely noticeable but it was so worthy including!
All that and the poor bastard forgot to put his actual channel name in the maze lol
This was a triumph.
Why does this feel so fucked up... don‚Äôt get me wrong, I watched the whole thing and upvoted because it was fucking awesome. 

But now I feel like I‚Äôm the hamster and there‚Äôs just some asshole bigger than me, watching me fumble through some elaborate maze it made, for the sole purpose of it‚Äôs entertainment. 

I‚Äôm sure it tells itself I‚Äôm happy tho ü•≤ the poor stupid thing is glad for the ‚ú®stimulation‚ú® here‚Äôs your reward for enduring my torture chamber, once you‚Äôve relaxed my next one will be ready! Over and over and over until you die

...I think that‚Äôs enough Reddit for today.

2:20, 2:50, 4:22, 6:34 and 7:10 - pause for grooming. Action heroes need to look good too!
Ok everyone, pack it up. The internet has officially peaked. Let‚Äôs shut it down and go home.
That hamster's name? Gordon Freeman.
The next Season for Fall Guys is looking great!
Shawshamster...
They were cheating, the hamster had the maze blueprints tattooed on his chest.
The cutest little nugget ever. And so fastidious. 

I did have a stress moment when the ceiling was coming down.
This is why the internet exists.
The maze is a work or ART.
Isn't the second half from an older video?
Legend has it that this hamster slaughtered the entire organization who imprisoned him systematically, with no hesitation and no remorse.
I reminded me a bit of Among Us doing their missions
Can we get an American Nina warrior Course!!!!
my favorite part is when he cleans his face^^
That level of no fucks given casts doubt onto whether or not this is a hamster or a honey badger
So much cardboard lol
All I can think about is the hamster just waking up in some sort of saw scenario not knowing what is going on.
Op, are you depressed?
My boy just escaped from Black Mesa
I just wanna know who actually comes up with these DIY small creature mazes!? This is probably the most badass one i have seen so far. There‚Äôs also the other jail-break hamster maze floating around but this way blows it out of the water by far!
WT everlovin' F?! And he keeps having these hamster-appropriate panic attacks as he goes. Just...why?? This is so now 'aww'.
ANDY!
Best 10 minutes of my life
The hydraulic press scene was at a Die hard level of action
Hamster Pit of Heresy! The random pauses to wash her ears and fluff her whiskers had me giggling madly ü§£ü§£
Hanmpter
award winning actor.......loved the emotions
Best 8+ minutes of my holiday so far
Mega aww
What kinda animal SAW is this?
The grooming breaks are adorable. I also like how he occasionally looks up at the camera like "So do I get a treat now?"
When he almost got crushed in the bailer... tense moments
The new portal looks dope!
That was harrowing!
Adorable.  Love how he stops to groom himself.
Does it really poop in that little toilet?
The effort put into this video. Amazing!!!
the BTS from the G-force
This hamster is really smart!!

Now try this with a guinea pig =D
The snake timing  and the spider was off man
This was phenomenal
this hamster is living their best legend of zelda life
Epic.
Shouldn't the hot water be on the left? :)
I‚Äôve never been so emotionally invested in a journey
this is so elaborate i love it-
Are the arrows different colors because of a green screen with the lava effect?
Hampter
How many takes this took?
Man, those PETA folks are going to flip out on this one!
Omgosh, this has GOT to be the happiest damn hamster ever!
Clearly escaped from the lab at the Rats of Nimh
That‚Äôs one happy hamster üòÇ more stimulation than i‚Äôve had in 27 years of life
I‚Äôve seen comments in other videos like this that say the hamsters are distressed by this type of thing, but this hamster seemed super chill so I bet it was just fine. Love it!
Is this a Japanese hamster game show
What‚Äôs the channel?
Whoever made this - you are awesome!!
Smart how it's looking around after each segment to make sure it's not missing any collectables!
I wasted my quarantine.
Who is mentally superior - the hamster who successfully negotiated the maze or me, the idiot who was transfixed watching it for 8 minutes?
 I like when he chews through the bars.
1000X better than Wonder Woman 1984
Hamsters like..everyday, we do this..
Aaand internet died halfway through
I want a hamster now
Where can I find tutorials to make a maze for my hammie
This is such good enrichment.
Corona gotta end. Ppl got way too much time and weed on their hands lol
This is the best movie of 2020
When the hamster was in the balloon  did it remind anyone else of Wonder Pets?
 You broke out, let me see if I can get  this straight. You went down the incinerator chute, on the mine car,  through the tunnels to the power plant, under the steam engine (that  was really cool by the way) and into the cistern through the intake  pipe. But--ahem-hem!--how, in the name of Zeus's *butthole*, did you get out of your cell?! I only ask because in our current situation, well, it could prove to be useful information. *Maybe!*
I hope it pressed up up down down left right left right B A B A start first.
That was pretty cool

And I‚Äôm sure PETA wasn‚Äôt to happy
What a happy little critter this must be!!! So much curiosity to keep exploring! Well done! Bravo! Bravo! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
u/savevideo
a-MAZE-ing. Has anyone ever told you you‚Äôre extremely creative?? Lol. Love hamsters. Got a friend for my kids teddy bear and miniature striped one. 3 weeks later we had 30 hamsters...3 weeks later again we had more. Then we separated them the four of them. But not before we had even more hamsters. They‚Äôre FAST to multiply.
That moment when he‚Äôs like shit the door behind me shut lol
The cleaning animation means he is saving the game.
This was the most cutest 8 minutes and 33 seconds of my life
 secret quest in hulf life
This is dedication right here and this hamster is probably happy his brain challenged!
I freakin love these videos!!! üôÇüòÖ
Wow amazingüòÄüòÄüòçüòç
CUTEST THING EVAR!!!
This was so freaking cute! I love how much OP must love his little friend in order to do all that. Precious!!
I love the quick little sand bath
My boy ploughin' through these obby courses like a ROBLOXian champ.
Half-life version is better
Best 8 mins I‚Äôve ever spent
Getting some serious Legends of the Hidden Temple vibes
This was significantly more thrilling than than Wonder Woman 1984.
This is THE BEST!!
Man this was much better than Wonder Woman 2!
Bravo!
How can they get Hammy to chew through those (while they avoided chewing on everything else)?
Great action movie. The most impressive thing is the hamster did all his own stunts.
Thank you that was fun
Man that shit was rigged

Great job by the creator tho they obviously put in a lot of effort
Very good my fellow friend ! Indeed!
I‚Äôm so proud of this lil guy!
Shawshank Hamdention
8 mins well spent!

Is this an episode of Alice in Borderland?
Oh this had made my day!! Brilliant!

What am I doing with my life.
