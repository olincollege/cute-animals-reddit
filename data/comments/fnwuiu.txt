Are you sure she's doing this right? Because I watched The Nutcracker several times and I can't spot any cats on the stage.
That cat is loved.
Now that's a pas de chat.
What a good dance partner! And teaching ballet for humans and cats, it's a twofer!
Awe I wish my kitty loved me this much
Made me grin from ear to ear. Very sweet and heart-warming. Both are adorable!
"I have to have a talk with my cat." Cutest thing I've seen all day.
Nice catch
They have goat yoga so why not cat ballet?
My cat also interferes in everything he possibly can, during one of my conference calls recently he jumped in my lap and then used his mouth to pull out one of my earbuds while I was talking to my boss.

As obnoxious as he can be, he's really helping to get me through quarantine right now. I've always been thankful to have him since he's sometimes been the only thing keeping me going, but it's time like this that I make sure to take time out if my day to spend it just enjoying his company.
I love how the cat looks at the camera, "just so ya know she loves me the meowest!"
I am here to say that I love your sister's room and wall color choices!
I grew up dancing so your sister taking the time to make sure she continues her student‚Äôs education really makes me smile. Add the cat and I‚Äôm just a ball of mush over here.
So awesome. what a wonderful teacher
that is the face of a cat who is loved, knows it, and loves in return.
Both cat and human were very graceful.
Song: ‚Äúbring me a higher love‚Äù
Cat: ‚Äúok, ima jump nao‚Äù
‚ÄúShe‚Äôs never done that before!‚Äù

And now that you know that she can, she will never do it again. Cats, how do they work?
I recently moved into a city that was just hit hard by the virus. Since I moved, my cat has suddenly become very vocal and she rarely used to meow at all. Today I was cooking and she walks into the kitchen repeatedly meowing at me so I had to pick her up and walk her around telling her I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere and that I was sorry if she thought I had left and we looked around the house making sure there were no robbers because that level of noise from her was frightening. I sat by her all evening just to make sure she wasn‚Äôt sick or hurt. She cuddled with me and stared into my eyes for literally the entire day. She is so happy I‚Äôm working from home. We don‚Äôt deserve cats.
I love this so much! Good to know my cat isn't the only one who wants to be stepped on.
Aw, I love this video! Brought me back to my ballet days as a kid. Your sister seems like an amazing teacher. Thanks for posting, this made my day.
Meanwhile my cat runs between my legs and almost trips me every time I walk past the food bowls
This is the best
10/10 I would love taking lessons from them!
"Part of" the show?, Mother i AM the show.
I love how she covertly pets the cat with her foot as she's coming down into position
"going to pause it for a minute because i have to have a talk with my cat"   
i love her and her cat ToT <3
This is fucking adorable.
Thank you so much for this video! It made my day!!
Seeing and hearing the family life of my professors has made me realize how we are all normal people going through this thing together. Already had a virtual lecture interrupted by the son of one of my professors and it was the most adorable thing ever.
This is definitely in my top three favorite internet cat videos ever.
r/PetTheDamnKitty
Wow! She is so graceful! She moves with such fluidity .....oh and your sister is there too üòòüòú

On a more serious note, your sister is spectacular!!
Appropriate in a way...

Chass√© (the ballet term she says) is a homophone of "chat" and "c'est"... which are the French words for "cat" and "this is". Interesting... to the French nerds among us.
[Freestyle Dog Dancing](https://youtu.be/GL3DXJE9UJk)

Cats really are better suited for ballet...

Your Sister's mesmerizing
A lot of us dancers have surprise isolation duet partners now!
Is anyone thinking "damn what an awesome living room!"
The cat is really smart. She was snapping her fingers to the rhythm of the song, and just before the cat jumps up she says ‚Äúand chin UP‚Äù and snaps on beat. This very perceptive cat interpreted the ‚Äúup‚Äù and snap as a command to jump into mom‚Äôs arms. So smart, so cute.
She looks like the ballet dancer on an episode of Peg Plus Cat that my kids and I watched today! This is too cute!
Your sis is giving everyone the little pick up they need plus keeping her classes going.  Means more than she probably realises.
I'm a server.. my cat loves that I'm home. He's cuddling and loving me having time off.... to be honest... I kinda like having a bunch of free time with my cat too.
I just have to say your sister is absolutely gorgeous!
She needs one of those baby carrier wrap things to give the cat constant affection while being an effective teacher!
"Bring me a Hiiiigher love!" 

Cat: YES!
I love her mismatched socks!
My cat when I work out in the back yard. You'd think he'd avoid the clanging of metal and and thumps of weights. Nooooo...I'ma walk between your legs while you lift. I'ma jump on your chest while you bench press.
Was expecting to see the cat launched into outer space.
Adorable video, thank your for sharing. That is a happy cat, you can tell by how the trail curls at the end.
Love them both‚ù§Ô∏è
That's adorable and so is your sister.
This is legit the first time I‚Äôve genuinely smiled in. Week. Thank you
I can‚Äôt stop watching this video omg it‚Äôs so good!! I shared it with my fianc√© and we are just crying over the phone over this sweet cat and her reaction üò≠üò≠üíñ
Very impressed at the fact kitty didn‚Äôt get stepped on lol
That was adorable. I wanna say the cat saw the right hand touch up high on her chest and then go up... I own two cats and Ill pat on myself or the couch or whatever if I want them to jump and they usually do.. bet that cat was like... huh.. well okay! Whoosh.
Pli√© meow
Lol the grace when the kitty is weaving in and out. I would be tripping all over the place
Where can I sign up for her class?
Your sister seems like the coolest person tbh.
Shes an amazing dancer
This is exactly what I needed to see today. Thank you for the smile!
No no
Your sister is beautiful inside and out! I wish she were my ballet teacher!
The best way to get a cat to pay attention to you is to ignore it, and vice versa.
Genuinely amazed to say that I know your sister! I've never stumbled across someone I know on Reddit like this before :)
So wholesome.
My son‚Äôs Tae Kwon Do is also doing remote lessons.  I really appreciate it because it gives us something fun to do.
I love how the cat jumped up just knowing she would got caught. What trust.
Dogs bugging you while doing yoga is OUT, cats bugging you while doing ballet is IN!
I love her cheery and bright decor. Matches your sister perfectly.
I get that this is r/aww, but your sister moves elegantly af. She‚Äôs very impressive!
Hell yeah Steve Winwood!

Cute kitty too of course!
Omg I know her and she‚Äôs amazing! She hosted a show for my small band a year ago

Mirror for anyone ctrl+F ing for a gfycat version https://gfycat.com/vainloathsomehusky
I love this, could this become a new trend? Cat ballet, hope so
This vid has r/sweatypalms and r/nonononoyes potential
Somehow, her place is exactly what I'd expect from a ballet teacher/ dancer. You can really see her creative mind being reflected in her home.
this made my whole week
That was really wholesome, thank you, I needed that.
Cutest thing ever.... awesome cat.
How do I sign up to take her classes?  I did ballet as a child and I miss it.  Plus the cat is lovely.
I dare her to try a tour jete.
Who is this teacher? I love her and her cat üíï
This cat is so damn happy that hooman stay at home
i would‚Äôve kicked that cat so many times accidentally omg
Not the point but i love your sisters decor - her style is vibrant!
This made my day. You have a lovely sister!
She says "And up!" And that cat does not even hesitate. Adorable.
This put a huge smile on my face - thank you.
So cute! Please post it to /r/blackladies

I WONT BE IGNORED !!!
Tin Foil Hat Time: Coronavirus is a conspiracy designed by all of our pets to have us stuck at home so that we have to spend more time with them!

&#x200B;

at this point under lockdown day 1 (UK) it is the only clear reason!
She's gonna boot that fucking cat in her advanced classes
So relatable. My son is a 12 year old ballet dancer in pre professional training. He has been doing daily online classes and his Bichon dog appears in every video. Whether its sauntering by while he is dancing or hanging out in the background.
I thought she had a dust bunny on her carpet but it turns out my screen was dirty.  Day 18 in lockdown and I'm starting to get weird.
Get the cat a hockey helmet.
So awesome! Shared with my non-redditor daughter, a college ballet student of color, she'll love this for many reasons, thanks for sharing.
u/vredditshare
This is honestly so precious
This was so precious. My cats did that years ago. Animals are really getting the good side of whoever pushed pause on life. Get them a treat when you go get them food next time. They deserve to be spoiled with how much they love us. My cat is currently sleeping on her favourite pillow, my hand.
She is dodging the cat like a pro.
The best! She was so into the lady‚Äôs enthusiasm.
I've seen goat yoga, now cat ballet, what's next?
This is the equivalent of my cat sprawling on my keyboard and not letting me use it
Will I be needing a cat to complete this lesson?
r/petthedamncat ... cat took responsibility into his own hands! Er... paws?
Great song btw
hahahaha cat in the way!! omg the cat is getting jn her way! hilarious!
Cat's just like "Me too! I wanna be part of the lesson too!"
Thia is the perfect cat-attitude.
This made my day.
Kitty obviously wanted to make her trip
Cat was choreographing their own dance
Kevin Costner just ate his heart out
"love me dammit!" Lol so cute!
What a meowneuver!
/r/MadeMeSmile
The music really makes this.
Why are cats so awesome?
Kitty thought this was a duet
She looked like a very kind lady !
That's what you get for ignoring me
Amelia!!!!!!! You and your cat are reddit-famous :D

This is the cutest EVER and put the biggest smile on my face! Thank you for being the bright and beautiful light that you are in my life and in the world. Sending you so much love and hoping we can all dance together again one day once this pandemic calms down. <3
That is some seriously heartwarming shit. Love it!
finally,something uplifting.
That beautiful cat with the jade green eyes...
That cat obviously has different ideas about how time in quarantine should be spent.
Do I need a cat to follow instructions?
I would have booted my cat across the lounge twice.
I feel like I‚Äôm having an acid trip with the amount of colors I‚Äôm seeing
This song is amazing. I miss the 80s.
So cute
that is heart warming! Thank you! I needed that
I often forget how technical dancing is. Makes you appreciate it on another level
Her taste is music is impeccable.
Oh, love!
She is doing awesome.
This is so fucking cute
What's her site or ytchannel? I'd love to do these balletlessons
that's some Buster Keaton-level near-misses there!
This comment section confirms a once debatable belief; that all cat people are crazy.

Just kidding! But my cat agrees with this statement.
Ok this video is pretty cute! :D
Aww üíú she wanted attention and you weren't giving it to her so she jumped up! My best guess from the looks of it. So adorable üòÇ
My fur babies are not sure what to take from this change as well. Take some pictures and remember the hours well spent. Great video, a nice change from the narrative.
She was clearly just demonstrating an entrechat six.
I love it!! What a great way to start the day, with a smile:)
What was that show where the perein did poses on an analog clock to teach everyone time? Vaguely want to say raggedy Anne looking girl with a cat/dust bunny?
We gonna ignore her saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry she likes to be kicked between my legs‚Äù LMFAO. Hilarious but also concerning about what goes through the cat‚Äôs mind
"bring me that higher love..." *pounce!*
"whoa -ohh"
ling ling would have been able to dance ballet while carrying a cat
I feel like the cat is trying to teach your sister. 

Cat: tighten up your movements! But still be graceful!!
That cat did a saut de chat instead of a chass√©.
u/zia1997 Omg this is so funny and adorable
Cats are f**king stupid and that's why I love them!
Shh sshh this is my favorite part, this is where the Cat sings ‚ÄòMemories‚Äô
‚ÄúHow about we add me jumping into your arms on the 8 count? The routine seems a little dry and the jump could save this.‚Äù
"She's doing it on purpose" we know, typical
Cattitude: Lesson over, I need a cuddle.
Let's appreciate how she moved her legs around her cat tho

the coordination with cat and leg is astonishing
The Rum Tum Tugger is a curious cat.
My yoga teacher has a cat that likes to lick its butt on zoom üòÇ
This got a lot of comments so I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll see this but wanted to say, first, this is awesome and second, does she post any of the lessons online, my 3.5yo daughter is obsessed with wanting to take ballet lessons, but, you know, Covid-19 and all, so that might be a while.  Either way thanks to both of you for a good-hearted smile to start my day.
A pax de mew.
Her house aesthetic is goals üíñüíñüíñ
Pas de chat!
Awww she had the biggest smile ever when she caught her cat!
Her smile when the cat jumps in her arms tho. That just made my whole day :)
They are both wonderfully adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è
They should collab and start a 2 woman show
MY COUSIN IS DOING THE SAME THING!
I like her use of color in her living space
That's what you get when you play higher love while practicing ballet with a cat.  Every. Damn. Time.
dat kat sure wants some pats
Now this is the CATS movie I wouldn't mind going to see.
Pet. The. God. Damn. Cat. üò≠üò≠üòÇüòÇ
This is obviously a Cat's.audition for the future Queen Mephistopheles
Is the cat a necessary part of this performance she's teaching?
>"I'm going to pause it for a second cos I have to have a talk with my cat"

I cracked up. Such a lovely video
OMG. I needed this!! Absolutely wonderful üòªüòª
lol! in my online classes that I attend every weekend, you would see my classmates and instructors' cute cats and dogs on the background as well...
Ur sister is so pure.
I hope your sister knows her cat is awesome! So cute!
Is there any place she‚Äôs streaming for free (just had to ask). I used to teach ballet and would love to get back to it!
She‚Äôs trying to be helpful. Such a sweet kitty!
that jump at the end  üòπüòª
Cool socks
If you don't involve your cat, I'm not watching more clips. I'm serious.
The cat was just taking a cue from the song
Awww
I got to say. This is my night. I found a funny picture of Qutin "Quarantino" and now this amazing internet cat video.

I think it's safe to say, my life is complete.
Love this.. I have two cats that look just like this and have to be in the middle of everything.
She's so graceful and doesn't fall over that cute kitty! So much envy. So much cute kitty.
This brings me some joy
Amelia! Oh yea, that cat is loved. Mew
When I grow up I want to have a yellow wall in my house.
They're both adorable.
I watched this at least 3 times. thank you for sharing. I'll be smiling for a while.  üòä
I want to do some remote ballet classes!
came for funny, stayed for cat, finished cuz Steve Winwood
üíïüíïüíïüíï
My cat rarely does that, she almost drop my phone one time. But she's still a loving cute rascal, haha
Great music choice for ballet class! I wonder which modern hits would go well with exercises. Now I have an idea!
This is absolutely amazing
So cute
Why do I love that her socks don‚Äôt match? Usually I don‚Äôt x
This really warmed my heart. Your sister seems like a great person.
Is that a torbie? She‚Äôs beautiful üòª
Aww thats so cute
She does it so easily... her thigh muscles and core must be really well toned.

And cats are so weird. lol
Are her classes available somewhere to take? She's awesome, and I would love to take ballet back up. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Your sister is an angel! And that cat is an assassin in training
Your sister seems like a sweet person.
She sounds like an amazing teacher! Her cat is awesome, too.
Are the lessons on YouTube?
This is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen in so long
Good choice of song
Ballet is so beautiful dude I just wish I didnt grow up in a religious family, I would've went that road a long time ago.
They have a great relationship...
What a nice way to start the day :)
Excellent finale!
You have a sweet sister!
Love this. She needs to make those public!
Thank you for posting this, it's really adorable
Please share the playlist!
I thought it gave up but then suddenly

‚ÄúI‚Äôve had the time of life and I owe it al you‚Äù
Jump!
Glad I turned up the volume and was surprised and pleased to hear your sister dancing to Steve Winwood. Please ask her what else is on the playlist.
This is lovely. Great song choice as well!
At my studio it‚Äôs been me and the director streaming classes remotely and she brings her little weiner dogs sometimes. It‚Äôs so much fun to dance with animals
Is that cat a soccer ball
This just made me smile after a very, very stressful day.
Her dancing partner is on point!!
This made me smile so much!   
We need more love and smiles these days, thanks to you both!
Wholesome.
Love the music!
Love it!

This. I adore both the teacher and and cat. The two of them together, forget about it.
Tres Grande Jete
How can I get my cat to pay attention to me like that.
This is adorable, and that cat has a beautiful pattern!
Watched 3 times :) came to comment. Back to the video, so sweet.
"If I run and leap at Terry, he will most certainly catch me in his arms. Coming in!"
Purrrrrfectly choreographed
The video is incredibly cute. Love the room too, just bursting with good vibes.
So sweet!
I didn't expect the end. I'm so happy right now.
so close to hitting her head phew
It kind of looks like your car is dancing with you, the way it weaves in between you.
Now for our next lesson, CAT YOGA
How do I sign up for this just to watch the cat?
I love this soooo much!!
Your sister is amazing and adorable. Cherish her. Love this.
This was my cat while I was trying to do yoga this morning.  I can't even imagine how she will be when I try to do my Zoom dance classes later!  For some reason, cats are personally offended by physical activity.
When all this is over and we are recovering I hope we've got a fantastic compendium of "Working From Home with the Help of Pets" videos to watch.
I would like to talk that cat as well, and let it know what a good kitty it is. So adorable.
I needed this. Thank you for sharing! Your sister seems like an amazing instructor and a lovely human being. And the cat is adorable!
Ok so to learn ballet you need a cat. Got it
I hope she got extra points for not tripping over the cat. That was pretty impressive coordination.
She brought her a higher love.
I love the fact that the cat has never done this before. Totally believe it. Probably like "hey, I'll make you pay attention to me!"
This might be the greatest cat video ever.
She seems to be a lovely human. The cat proves it
Totes made me smile.
Your sister is a delight
She‚Äôs a dancers too , I mean the cat

Unbelievably positive energy radiates from this lady
Awwww....lil lover kitty. So sweet. Ballet to modern tunes. Nice.
The cat seems to really enjoy it
They song transports me back to 87.
I‚Äôm gonna need to know how much for facetime lessons for my 3yo lmao probably too much for me to afford during quarantine but still, your sister is amazing and so patient with the cat.
That's adorable!!! And I love her style! That couch üòç
This is the best thing, she was so careful with how she put her feet, it was like they were dancing together.
Well u said up lol
awwwww noooooooo bring back kitty.....
What a cutie patootie
Hahaha this makes me happy. It's just so sweet!
This made me genuinely smile. Thanks for this!
This made me nervous
The cat eyes the camera with a ‚Äúshe might talk, but I won‚Äôt listen‚Äù look when she shows them off to the camera. Adorable.
FABULOUS!!!
Might be a good idea to put the cat away for a bit?
This made me chuckle. So adorable! :)
Miss matching socks to get the students to notice.
the cat is dancing with her XD
That is so cute! Love the odd socks as well.
Cats > every task you wanna do.
So is she a cat lady?
Higher love indeed
She‚Äôs wearing mismatching socks.
Cat be like: "Nice... She's improving!"
u/krazybanana
Hilarious!
An old coworker of mine has been doing the same on her instagram!! It‚Äôs so great. I love her positive vibes!!
The cat‚Äôs a natural!
Your sister has a cool house!
I love the way her foot perfectly pets the cat on one of the kicks.
Is that Higher Love by Steve Winwood playing in the background?

Dodge, dodge, parry, evade, attack!
Steve Winwood, hell yeah!
There are so many comment which is amazing but I am really missing my (adult) dance classes. Is this on you tube? What‚Äôs the link??

Thank you for sharing this! I've been very emotional today and nothing was cheering me up, but then I saw this and it made me laugh. If there are any positives to this Coronavirus, I'd say cats and dogs getting to spend more time with their humans is definitely one of them. Also her cat looks and acts like my first cat, Sage. He loved dancing, music, and getting attention, and I could totally have seen him doing something like this.
No human will ever have the poise and grace of a cat. Also, your sister and the kitty are beautiful =)
Pets are loving the quarantine right now. There owners' are ways home and they don't know why, but they're happy.
this is wonderful!üòª
BALLET: Must maintain poise. 
CAT: Must trip.

Force, meet object.
Our overlords are affectionate . . . so far

Send this to Joe Buck...he calls football games for Fox. He‚Äôs doing play by play on videos submitted by people working from home/quarantined. He‚Äôs on Twitter
This made my morning! What a cute video.
Feline grace.
Ohhh, such love. The Cat must really love seeing her dance
Oh man, everything about this right down to the soundtrack was exactly what I needed right now.  Thank you!
I cried.
I‚Äôm also doing my dance courses online but hers seem to be much funner than mine. I love it!
Cat: Hey you busy? ....naw you ain‚Äôt busy. (Jumps)
I was constantly expecting her to kick the cat on accident
Have to admire that the cat waited for the line "higher love" to jump high for some love.

They need a solo in the recital immediately
Hahahahaha this is perfect!
Step 3, catch the cat and twirl

The cat of pretty! What breed?
Talk about having grace. My clumsy ass would have figured out a way to knock the couch over
Yay. Free lesson. Thanks
this is what I needed today
Someone needs to choreograph a ballet and include some trained cats immediately
I wonder if the cat sees the ballet as cat-like movement. The movements are ballet are fluid and graceful, like a cat.
It‚Äôs just too fucking cute.

That's it. I'm getting a cat.
I suddenly want to paint my walls while I'm under lockdown...
trop mignonne ü•∞
Does anyone know why do pets insist on interfering with your work out as if their life depends on it? Are they sensing increased tension and trying to pull it down back to normal?
Pleasantly surprised that it was a kitty.
Loved it heaps made me laugh in a world gone sad
I love your sisters cat...
I love the pure joy when she catches her cat!!
What a beautiful lady- shown even brighter by her interactions with kitty. 

Part of learning the performing arts is learning to keep poise/presence in the face of obstacles or the unexpected. I learned musical instruments with the presence of a very critical Siamese. Takes a lot to throw me off my concentration when I'm in concert mode.
Well she did say the word "up", Cat is just following instructions.
Wow, the cat can jump so high!
Chat de deux
Whiteshoes! Calm down!
Cat is like ‚ÄúHELLOOOO? KITTY IS DOWN HERE. PAY ATTENTION TO KITTY.‚Äù
I just woke up but I already know this is going to be the best thing I see on the internet today.
That cat comes in for the refrain right before the breakdown.

The tiring of everything in this video, not surprising because she's a dancer, but really everything. Is perfect.
Observe the dance of my people.

*bumps into hooman legs then saute
Solid music choice,  she checks out!
I want to take her class.
This class is better than my classes.
I want a cat sooo bad
I don't mean to be horrible but I kept waiting for her to accidentally boot the cat
Oh my god that's adorable.
What breed is that cat?
What a babbey!
One of the sweetest things I've ever seen!
cat heard UP and went up. doesn't understand why human is confused.
I'm having a bad day and this just put a smile on my face! Thank you op, your sister and her kitty üê±üòΩ
Nice
Unexpected and cool.
Ok but shes so good at smoothly avoiding hurting the kitty. This vid is so cute
I have heard of goat yoga but cat ballet is new.
i haven‚Äôt been out of the house in a week (yes, i know that‚Äôs minimal compared to others) and it‚Äôs been raining non stop here so my mood has been super low. this video made me smile ear to ear and giggle. thank you for this! i hope your sister sees how much of an impact she‚Äôs made, not just on her ballet students!
What an absolutely lovely person.
I love her colorful apartment!
I dance in my room when I‚Äôm bored. My cat used to do the same thing. He recently ran away though. :(
What‚Äôs the link to her lessons?
That is an awesome cat.
A new dance/sport is just being invented.
Is there any way to access these lessons? I'd gladly pay
That is hilarious and adorable!
She should totally put this on YouTube. It is cute!
Videos like these make my mornings so much better.
Dude did the cat jump up to her face right at the chorus when Steve is like "show me your higher love" what a smart Gato
I love this, so heartwarming
I‚Äôve watched this so many times because it‚Äôs too cute. Also my cat has the same pattern, so I‚Äôm here at work missing my cat üò©
That is awesome =)

This needs to become a performance
Are these on line? I WANT TO TAKE HER CLASS!  I love her music choice!
As a man... I would take ballet class with cats. Period.
Do the students have to supply their own cat?
Cat optional but highly recommended.

Wow, what admirable balance she has to pet the cat with outstreched f√∂ot.

Her cat is so sweet, partaking in coreopraphy wit her mom.
I would watch this just for more cat interruptions
Props for Higher Love, Dennis & Dee would be proud.
This is the content humanity needs right now. üòçü•∞
Cat performed a grand jete. 10/10 mousers
Wonderful dance partner
Question for op! Is there any chance this class is public on youtube or a media? The first time I saw this (9gag) I thought maybe it was one of those persons that upload tutorial videos on youtube and tried to get her name and ended up here.

I guess it's her job and she doesn't upload on media. But could you confirm please?

She looks so proud of herself. Like, "look mom, I participated!"
Does she have a website?  I have a niece who would love to do videos.
God, this is so adorable.
Isn't this from the movie, Dancing with Cats?
Remove that lazy fat ass cat who just wants to sleep and eat all day !!

Made me smile! So nice!!
Oh muito god
I loved seeing this. I unexpectedly had to put my cat down on Monday and this made my heart melt. That cat loves and trusts her.
This video makes me SO HAPPY.
I want your sister to be my ballet teacher! Is there an email where I can contact her to ask her about prices, etc?
Cat was hoping to do the dirty dancing lift.
That was awesome
#LOVEIT!!!! Best home body to be with! 
Keep them coming..üòç
Wonderful
The corona virus version of Cats. "Cat".
You should try Zoom Cloud Meetings.  Because of the virus our congregation just started having our meetings this way and people on all kinds of devices joined in.  

Love the markings on your cat.  Brown tabby are the best cats we‚Äôve ever had and we‚Äôve had many.
Why is her face so much darker then neck and arms?
How do I join your class???
My mom is too and is doing the same thing. Bit because she's recovering from cancer, covid was just the cherry on the cake...
Omg your sister and her cat are the cutest things I have ever seen. Life goals!
I dont think she realized how many people would be saying "no no" when she stopped the video.
What a lovely lady

This kitty just wants to dance!
I think ballet was inspired by cats
This made me smile. Thank you. :-)
You know that cat loves her
I always thought it was sashay not shasay. TIL!
How come my cats dont jump into my arms like that?!
Let. Her. PLIE
Mine do the same, every night when go to the kitchen in the dark, I have to be super careful to not crush it
Lmao that cat is just making my day
Hahaha!  That cat fits itself right in!  No fear!  :D
I‚Äôve been practicing. Now I‚Äôm a believe I‚Äôm a freaking ballerina in a cowboy hat.
That was completely adorable.
This is the most wholesome thing I am crying rn
 So cute
question, Will the cat be in the next dancing lesson?
Is she colour blind?
Put that damn cat in a cage, I would be pissed if I was paying for this bs class.
The mismatched socks really sell the professionalism :)
... when your cat is that adamant about being an asshole - stop trying to be cute when you‚Äôre trying to teach - and put the cat in another room for fuck sakes.
It's something but unfortunately she cannot adjust or show her students proper stance. I hope she adjust her price according to that too
Don't let the appearance fool you she kind of looks like gus fring from breaking bad
Who does Ballet to this kinda music tho ü§∑
The mismatched socks bother me more than they should  ;)  cute video though --

This is adorable, but the music just makes me think of the gym scene in Always Sunny.

I am mildly infuriated by her non-matching socks.
This girl wears so much makeup she looks like a reverse mime.
Teacher: Going to have a ‚Äúchat‚Äùwith my cat
*throws her out the window then turns on camera*
Student: Where‚Äôd the cat go?

Teacher: Oh she‚Äôs just sleeping üòÖ

Jokes aside, what a wholesome video. Thanks for sharing
how the hell?!? i wanna hump that high!
