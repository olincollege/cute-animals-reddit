The best part about this video is that if you substituted their yelling with a dozen or so screaming rubber chickens I wouldn't be able to tell the difference
I bet that duckling feels pretty powerful right about now. 
I love the guy running with their hands up
This is a perfect example of the weird shit freshman at college get up to in the dorms. Nowhere else does this kind of thing happen on a regular basis
Poor baby!  No one wants to play with him.
"Why are you running? Why are you running?
This is good wholesome random dorm stuff.
I love the fact that they don't stop yelling when they turn around. 
I chose this name for a purpose
So someone imprinted on that duckling.  Hopefully they make sure it's taken care of.  
I gotta be honest, I was expecting a pack of cute puppies to be chasing them. Boy was I in for a cute surprise 
All I have to say is Spongebob and too many people will know what I mean by it, hopefully

Thank you everyone. I’m genuinely happy that I made hundreds of people’s days! That’s the only thing that matter to me. 
Technically speaking they are being chased by a dinosaur so...
We need to complete this with some Benny Hill music, and then just loop it constantly. 
A little concerned where the duckling came from and of it was cared for properly after this...
So, are all of you the duckling's mommy?
I can relate, little ducky. Men run from me, too. 😂
I like this 
Me running from the smallest of responsibilities
This needs a "MY LEG" somewhere in there.
No doubt this continued back and forth for like an hour.
To be honest. I thought it was a ball and I was waiting for a puppy to run across
The dude at about 2.2-3.1....White shirt, grey shorts, striped socks...

When in deadly deadly danger....when beset by doubt...run around in circles...wave your arms and shout.
I miss college
Run!!! It's a quack attack!!!
The little duckling: 

"Wait! Wait! Guy's I'm coming! Woohooo! This is fun! But maybe slow down a bit, I can't keep up all this waddling!" 
I LOVE this!!  Thank you!!
“Wait for me guys!.. I’ve got little legs!”
Genuinely made me laugh! Thank you!
The horror!!! 
That is some damned fine OC.
I hope they all survived.
This has easily become my new favorite video.
How did they all quickly reverse their direction without stepping on that duckling?
Have a platinum
If I had gold I would give it to you pal that’s amazing
Bros, let's get the quack outta here
Oh lawd, he comin'!
/u/vredditdownloader
This made me so happy 
Is the duck okay?
WE'RE ALL GOING TO BEA-KILLED
Flipping crazy lol
Reminds me of pacman
I wish me and my friends were this creative. 
What kind of dog is this?
Someone needs to edit in the duck saying “why are you running?” when he passes 
Lmao
This made my night 
Best thing I've seen all month. Wait a sec...
He just wants to be one of the bros...
Y’all remember that episode of spongebob with the butterfly 
I imagine when they turned around they were like, "Okay, just...a bit.... WTF CHAD DON'T STEP ON MR McDONALD DUCK!!! that's better ...". 
with a duck lol
😂 There’s nothing better than people being silly. Love it! 
College “bros” can be some of the most adorable/sweet people

I was a sweetheart of a fraternity in college and got the pleasure of seeing stuff like this all the time, there was a fraternity cat that they cared for like an infant, even bought it clothes & cradled it like a baby. If I needed to walk home after a party 5+ of them would walk me back, creating a wall around me, pretending to be secret service w/ the finger to the ear & how they had to “protect the special cargo”.  I called them my nuggets & if they saw me around campus they’d scream “mama” and run and hug/tackle me. Guys are so fucking adorable in the right conditions, oh man.
THE SKY IS FALLING 
Thank you comments!

Was trying to figure out how the tennis ball was chasing them.
OH LAWD HE COMIN!!!
This is up there with my freshmen floor's prank of an indoor slip and slide. Nostalgia.
That's no ordinary, rabbit! That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on.

I watched it without sound and I immediately thought of the [Benny Hill Theme](https://youtu.be/MK6TXMsvgQg) 
Love!!!


I’m just scared that someone would step on it :(
Only thing i could think of was them all running back and one guy accidentally stepping on the duckling. 
Aquack on Titan.
The main question is - why is there a chick there?
I just got reddit like a month ago and I still have no idea what I’m doing, what is karma and how do I get it?

When I was younger we lived on a farm and found 2 ducklings by themselves, bought them home and got food from the rivers everyday, although it was my brother, cousin and I who found and fed them they would always follow my sister in single file, one was a mallard and one a paradise duck, when they got old enough they just flew away, sad but happy at the same time.
Aw man I’ve had a rough as fuck day, this has genuinely made me feel a bit better. 
on today's episode of  frat or 'rack house....
A bunch of chickens running? I don't get it
No naruto run??
He's coming
😂
They woke up its inner dinosaur
That beast is the kin of goose the cat...
I did not see that coming and snorted loudly when I saw the chick
... So the 100 duck sized horses then?

Yes my precious get em 
I'm sure the other residents are thrilled.
Take your gold. This was wonderful. 
THIS is what people mean when they say ‘Boys will be boys’!!
This is so wonderful 
Was that a duck?
Lmao the bird must be so happy though.
That is really funny
This reminds me of ARK (dinosaur survival game)

I bred an elite team of super-dodos, dropped them on an island and gave them the command to lay waste to Trikes, Parasaurs, Dilophosaurus... it was brutal
hahaha lol made my day
"I'm so startled!"
I get it.
Is this the new Jurassic park trailer?
Well that was awesome
I needed this today, thank you OP and the rest that linked similar videos. 
Oh my Gods is the screaming form Shrek? XD

Imagine having that many friends.
In the twilight of April 1, this extremely loud gif played at night at full volume on my mobile. Bravo, I suppose.
My dorm was not this cool. I will reapply to college just to be a part of this. 
Sigh. I wish there was like a hundred ducks. I mean one little one is fine. But like a whole heard would be much more fine. 


Was that even a duck? Doesn't matter. Wish it was
NYOOOOOM! 
Thought someone was rolling a tennis ball until I came to the comments...joke's on me! You pulled a quack one
When you miss your Spanish lessons
That's an agent of the Duolingo bird, you better start running
Reminds me of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buv2tAyxmgw).
I had literally this scene outside my dorm room in 2001 at WPI after the network went down. Instead of a duckling, though, it was some asshole with his mattress on his head.

They used that mattress as a toboggan down the stairs.

The network was down for 4 days. This happened in the first 10 minutes.
This is the most interesting game of duck-duck-goose ever
I can never see these posts. They are always just frozen and never play 
Why will this video not load for me ? Anyone else having problems? 
And then someone stepped on poor thing. 
RIP headphone users
It's like a Scooby Doo episode

Pathetic...
Ducklings are so damn much fun. I need another, because while I was out of town, my hubby found my oldest duck chewed up. She was about 6 years old, a runner. I am down to one duck, and three geese. 
Boys will be boys 😄
I would like updates as the baby duck grows up in college and continues chasing people at least through graduation haha

AHAhahahah go crazy! AhahahhHHAhahh go stupid!
This is why you live in the quad freshman year. It's an experience (especially if you have a closely knit floor).
Reminds me of the wormy episode of spongebob lol
My question is how did none of you accidentally step on the little fellow when turning around

Poor guy is probably ugly 
I was a little annoyed to be watching a video of college bro hijinks, but then i saw that adorable little bird!

What a bunch of wild apes! And a chick!
How did they not step on them?? 
I thought this was supposed to be a joke on the final round of the pokemon stadium streaming stampede mini game. With the large group of everything and then the one straggler at the end it looks just like it lol
Is that little Yasmine Bleeth?
Its bed o clock you best be sleeping
take me to rhe water!
actually a mood
Why are you running?
I'd like to think that these guys continued to scream wildly while also gingerly moving around the duckling as to not hurt it as they lined up to run the other way. 
Lame
[It all makes sense now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/reallifedoodles/comments/b8943q)
I was skeptical but this *is* the best video I've seen all day. 
/u/VredditDownloader
At first I thought they were pretending to be afraid of it, but now the more I loop it, it seems like they’re just trying to be a flock and make the little ducky feel included.
Why are you running? meme
Laugh all you like, that duckling killed 389 people during his rampage.
"What, behind the ~~rabbit~~ duckling?"
You need to see more things daily.
I liked this on Twitter when it only had 400 likes and now I feel special
Step off! *Step off!*
Terrifying!
*Rumors say they were never seen since...*

Someone needs to doodle arms on the duckling.

Who’s the unlucky guy who was chosen by the little ducky?
In the hospital right now and this definitely cheered me up so much. Thanks OP. 
Lmao this reminds me of the SpongeBob episode when everyone in town is running away from Wormy after he turned into a butterfly
Fucking amazing 😂😂
I hope he wasn't scared shitless and following them because he assumed there was something to run from :(
I just feel really bad for it. It must feel so lonely!

Is that a chickeeen?

God, I hate teenagers. Six in the damn morning and I was not prepared for a dozen of them to scream like idiots.
This isn’t exactly a good thing... they probably made this little duckling imprint on humans which isn’t advised. It sounds cute to have a little duckling running after you but the fact remains it causes a lot of issues for the little guy later down the road. 

The tale of the Ugly Duckling is partly true partly lie. A human imprinted duckling will try to belong to a species it can never belong to, just like the Ugly Duckling. Only the Ugly Duckling eventually finds its real family. A human imprinted duckling will never understand it really belongs with ducks, and will forever remain an outcast and unable to function with other ducks. 

Please think long and hard before you let ducklings imprint on you ❤️
