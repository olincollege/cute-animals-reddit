How to get a cat to use a bed you bought: put it on the roof.
Some people confused about pillow falling to the roof. Here is wider angle https://imgur.com/a/wPUg2JD
there‚Äôs a ball there for entertainment as well !
Looks like r/stolendogbeds can shut it all down now, we've found the ultimate.
Can you drop a blanket too ?
Finders sleepers
This looks a lot like Turkey.

Cat: huh? Roof pillow from god?  God must love cat! Thank you god!
Gods Must Be Crazy: Cat Edition
Someone is wondering why the hell their cat never comes inside now üòÇ
Best nap spot ever.
Why you throwing dog pillows off your balcony?
Dog giveth and cat taketh away
That's adorable
As we say in french: "Le malheur des uns, fait le bonheur des autres." Which roughly translates to : One's misfortune is another's boon.
thanks, i love it
I wonder if the dog will work out he can get his pillow back by throwing down the box it came in?
Thats gonna be a funky pillow after the first rain.
The cat deserves it!! üíï
/r/StolenDogBeds
Aw and little kitty has gratefully received it.
My dog would be looking down at this from the roof and grumbling til the end of time
>fell to the roof

Are you from Australia?
Ohhh too cute!!
Kerala?
No one gonna ask exactly how the dog managed to throw its bed out the window..? When I was about three I got the sudden impulse to throw anything and everything I can out the window. We lived on the second floor. We had those iron grates on our windows for security, but if I could squeeze it through and it wasn't bolted to our floor, it flew. Literally anything and everything. Cd players, walkmans, magazines, video games, PILLOWS, clothes, crayons, seriously the list is endless.
It has a new owner meow.
That‚Äôs adorable

Cat has also claimed a soccerball. He/she has got it made up there.
The real question is, how tf does a pillow end up on a roof?
Man I couldn't live there. I'd be Kobe-ing stuff down that chimney every chance I got.
The only reason Kitty did it was because he knows Doggo can see him in it. Kitty's are assholes like that.
I think you ment it had a new owner MEOW
You don't live nearby, by any chance, do you? Because that very much looks like my cat, who suddenly does not come when I call him for his nap time. I can see why now.
Looks suspiciously like [my neighborhood cat](http://imgur.com/a/rz7pyWj)
All I'm thinking is that ball is a sad story

Cats will always steal the dog's bed in the end.
Those hack roof repairs make me scream internally. First, Jesus man, just buy some peak tiles, they aren't that expensive. Second, if you're going to use aluminum flashing to do this AT LEAST install it bottom to top so the overlap faces downward and doesn't allow for a water intrusion path.
If it fits it sits
That looks like roofs in Spain
I can‚Äôt wrap my head around the term ‚Äúfell to the roof‚Äù
Dog pillow?
Well damn that‚Äôs a roof
That is one comfy pig!
I think the question here is how that pillow got on the roof in the first place?
Did your dog lose his soccer ball too?
A very happy new owner
Just curious. How in the world the pillow fell through the roof?
How does your dogs pilliow fall on the roof?

Thats a cute cow. A bit too tiny but still cute.
Looks like a turkish pic i dont know how but i am pretty sure
I think you mean "It has a new owner meow." 

I'll just give myself up to the pun police.
Wait... how did your dog‚Äôs pillow accidentally fall to the roof??
Eagles be like: "This is too easy".
How does a pillow just fall out of a window? And how does it fall 15 feet away from the building? Was there a tornado when it fell? 

Someone threw that pillow out of their window and you're lying for karma.
Is this India?
This is waiting for someone to turn it into a children's book. Crop this photo and recreate it with watercolors or paint or somethi g and that's your cover.
"Man, what a windfall I've had. Praise the pillow gods!"

This is just adorable

You could get it back with a fishing pole...
How does a pillow "fell to the roof" ?
Fell?  Roof?
There's also a ball up there, the roof of forgotten goods.
That‚Äôs a pretty unusual case of r/stolendogbeds
"It has a new owner meow."
Where is this?

Never mind- found it in the comments. Turkey
One dogs loss is a cats new treasure.
New owner meow *
The cat has been missing for a week and no one has seen it.
Did it fall out or did someone push it out? *Dun dun dunnnnn*
I‚Äôm just here wondering how you drop a dog pillow, presumably a static object for 99.9999% of its life, off a balcony
Every thing happens for a reason
The cats like ‚Äúthis is a sign from heaven, must snuggle now‚Äù
This is so cute :)
Life in the Favela
That roof needs to be reshingled
Throw down more pillows and some boxes. You could watch a community of cats blossom.
Just want to address the elephant in the room..

If a pillow falls to the roof, where did it come from?

Another great metaphysical question people rarely ask themselves.
okay but HOW did the pillow land on the roof
Its a gift from god!
 gift from the gods above!
Wonder how the ball got there (near the chimney)
I'd chill up there to if I was that cat, new ball new bed. 

The gods smile upon khajit

Tbh if it were me I'd sprinkle some cat grass seeds on rainy days and let him find a little treat
That cat has a pretty sweet football there too.
What country is this in?
That roof construction is a fuckin mess

OP didn't have a fishing equipment to get the pillow back for the sad doggo. And for doggo the worst is that it went straight to its neighborhood enemy.
Imagine being a human and finding a bed on a roof and taking a nap.
That cat probably has a comfy bed it's owner bought, but refuses to use it.
i didn't know it was such a foreign concept for some people that there are higher buildings and things fall from their windows or balconies on the roof of smaller buildings
A new owner meow
You:

Your Dog: It is treason then
Your neighbors roof is fucked
You mean right meow it has a mew owner? XD
Where is this? This rooftop and other things look similar to my place ones.
Now climb down there and put that bed in the shade
From ashes to ashes.
This is too cool.  I wonder what the dog is thinking?
You know you‚Äôre an old homeowner when all you can think about in this picture is how horrible of shape that roof is.
N'aaaaaw
I guess I have a new wallpaper. Thanks!
Abit sad that the pillow will get wet and eventually break  :/
At least your dog wasn‚Äôt on the pillow

You're never get that back! Losers weepers.

The real question is how the pillow fell down to the roof
That roof is fucked tho. Who laid those ridge tiles?
Looks like someone tried to throw a soccer ball down the chimney

I didn't get why you didn't just go down and get it, but I can see you're out of balls too.
I guess everyone expects reposts like the one in r/stolendogbeds, but a Twitter user also claims it's theirs - > @AHappierDay (Lovely picture of course.)
I'm also feeling there's a sad story about the ball.
I‚Äôm pretty sure this post belongs to someone else. Somebody else shared it with more photos and they took the captions and translated them?
Is this somewhere in greece? Seems very familiar
Good lord that roof is in terrible shape
So you just left a moldy pillow to rot on your roof for days? Lol
Looks like the outside of my old apartment in Sao Paulo. Neat!
all those "how did pillow fell on the roof???" annoys me SO much. people live in tall buildings all over the world, not just small american suburbian houses, you know.

He went there to read a letter,
Meow, meow, meow
Where the reading light was better,
Meow, meow, meow
It was a love note for Don Gato.

"I adore you," wrote the lady cat
Who was fluffy, white, and nice and fat.
There was not a sweeter kitty
Meow, meow, meow
In the country or the city
Meow, meow, meow
And she said she'd wed Don Gato.

Oh, Senor Don Gato jumped with glee,
He fell off the roof and broke his knee.
Broke his ribs and all his whiskers,
Meow, meow, meow
And his little solar plexus,
Meow, meow, meow>
"¬°Ay caramba!" cried Don Gato.

Then the doctors all came on the run,
Just to see if something could be done.
And they held a consultation,
Meow, meow, meow
About how to save their patient,
Meow, meow, meow
How to save Se√±or Don Gato.

But in spite of everything they tried,
Poor Se√±or Don Gato up and died.
Oh it wasn't very merry,
Meow, meow, meow
Going to the cemetery,
Meow, meow, meow
For the ending of Don Gato.

As the funeral passed the market square,
Such a smell of fish was in the air.
Though the burial was slated,
Meow, meow, meow
He became re-animated,
Meow, meow, meow
He came back to life, Don Gato.
Guessing this is what happens without building regulations / codes
What's wrong with your roof
That's some shocking brick work..and the roof repair...oh dear.
That is one jacked up looking roof.
Bit of classy workmanship in that roof üôà Surprised the pillow didn‚Äôt go straight though it ü§£

At least someone's happy
Nice to see you dropped a dog bed onto someone else roof and just left it. Solid neighbor /10
Good thing the pillow falling did not bring the roof down! or the cat. That is a very sad roof which is not going to last much longer?

where is it btw? I thought at once not Portugal, the tile was wrong for it, I am curious now.
Fell to the roof? Does gravity not work where you live?
Fell... to the roof?! Is this australia?

"fell to the roof" ü§î
And you don't go retrieve it... you lazy POS.
You should give that cat a home. Already has ur dogs scent.
Is no one else upset that the doggo tax hasn't been paid?
If you want dog better you have to  take care of your dog or any animals....this is not the way of Care
What kind of idiot threw a pillow out?
My question is why don‚Äôt you pick up after yourself?
