Oh thanks heavens he finally did pet him. That was too much!
See... the problem is I can't do it myself. Look... see my hand doesn't reach!
Give it whatever it wants just make it stop being sad
I'd pet him till he's bald.

Edit: My first gold, Thank you stranger :)
/r/petthedamnseadog
Too adorable for words.
Holy heck my cat does this! Is that what she wants?!
Damn it. Makes me want a river otter as a pet. 
It‚Äôs eyes when it sees the pets are incoming!
We both lit up. 
"Uh.. uh... excuse me sir... Would you be ever so kind as to put your hand here...? Just here for a little bit..? Just on my head her- ermagerdthatssofkngoooood"
JUST FUCKING PET IT ALREADY
Thank you.  This is a candle in the dark.
When his paw did that little shake I just about died
I just find animals successfully communicating with humans both amazing and adorable. It's like trying to ask somebody for directions in another language. 
"Pet him you monster!-- Oh, thank goodness."
It's actually indicating with it's hand to pet :O
It's just amazing to see animals visually communicate with humans.
if i had this as a pet i'd literally cry everytime he did that. man. thats some heavy guilt he's dishing out.
Honestly im really impressed at that train of thought in an animal. Far as im concerned that's basically sign language.
I'm waiting for someone to come along and ruin it with science. I mean, I'd like to see that happen, with the little head pat and the sad eyes it doesn't look like anything other than asking for scratches.
god damn that's adorable, when it's trying to pet it's own head it looks like it's on the brink of crying.

Me during most of this gif

‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt fucking pet him soon I swear to god...‚Äù
This made my entire life
You left him hanging for a bit longer than I would have preferred OP
"Excuse me.  Could you, uh, hey, yeah, you, could you please pet me, um, on the head?  Aww yeah, that's what I'm talking about!"
Ok that's just ridiculously sweet
I'm a red blooded male in my 30s, and I almost teared up at how sad he looked while he was asking for head skritchies. 
I could feel my heart melting just watching that
heh, my cat pretty much does that, except for the extra smart extra cute other hand pretending to pat her own head.
He obviously understands everything we do.
The face he makes when he finally gets the petting remind me of my german Shepherd 
I feel like animals are just SOOO much smarter than we give them credit for. I mean, he pointed to his head with one hand and made a petting motion with the other.. what???! That‚Äôs so cool/ adorable!
am otter, fren - don get much love

can you jes do de touch ?

right on my head - up here, above

i'd like it Oh, so much!

a little pat is all i crave -

is such an easy task

is all i need, my life to save 

i Swear - that's all i ask!

the comfort of a hooman fren

that simple love you've shown

my happiness will never end -

the Best i've ever known !




You better pet him you bastard! 
Was he trained to do this? 

Pretty amazing communication skills if not
that is so sad
[deleted]
sir, sir excuse me sir.... siiir, yeh you can you do this on my head
That otter is smarter than my dumb dog.

Swap?
Human! I want pet
Otters are the best 
otters seem like lovable pets
If that creature didn‚Äôt get a pet during that gif I would of literally gone on a rampage, and I‚Äôm a pretty calm guy! 
I'm a simple man. I see a river puppy, I updoot.
Aww please keep petting and petting 
Those eyes are dead serious on what he needs. 
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! PET HIM!
oh my god come on with this
I love otters
Adorable!
Ohhhhh, my heart!

Thank Poseidon the otter got his pets or we were going to have a problem. 
I was about to start world war 3 if this video didn‚Äôt ended up with a petting 
I'm no vet, but I'm pretty sure it wants you to steal second base.
I have never commented in this subreddit. So this is officially the cutest thing I have ever seen.
As the clip professes

*oohh, it's shows that it wants to be petted, So cute *

*come on, pet it*

*PET IT*

*LISTEN HERE YOU MOTHERFUCKER, YOU BETTER PET IT OR I WILL FIND YOU"

*OH YOU'RE SO FUUU...oh...he petted it, So cute :3*
Pet the damn thing you bastard!
This animal has better communication skills than me
u/remotectrl 

Looks like a zookeeper from that bucket and setting. Interesting that the otter seems to have an idea of what petting is.....
Good lord. 
Teleport me to the alternate timeline where we domesticated otters instead of dogs 
Oh my fucking god
Wtf took you so long to pet, sadist!
My heelers do the same thing, and grab at my hand with their paws.
Me begging my wife for back scratches. 
It looks like he‚Äôs trying to hide his face to avoid awkward confrontation with other otters.
what took you so long!
What an adorably smart Otter!
As far as reposts go, this one is good enough to warrant it. So cute!
This makes my heart hurt!

I wanted to be so cute when I'm sad. But I'm just weird.
How come everyone has cool unique animals üòÇ like literally on my Facebook feed there is someone with a pet sloth and a FLIPPING MONKEY Like I Love Dogs But OMFG Would I Love A Pet Sloth 
Must....... acquire.... otter.......
I was getting some pretty bad anxiety over them not just petting the damn otter
Why would you ever stop petting her? 
u/FacelessPheonix
DUDE PET THE DAMN THING 
Wait.

Wait, wait.

Hold on a second.

Are you telling me someone had the ability to do that one petting thing on his head and **stopped**? How is this possible? What kind of sociopaths do we have watching after our otters?
How people can think that animals aren't sentient beings who need love and affection just like everything else on this planet- totally baffles me. Especially after seeing things like this.
I was going to lose my shit if no one pet him..
PET HIM YOU GODDAMN MONSTER!!!
u/vanillaberrycream 
PET HIM SOME MORE
By the 12th second of the video I'm screaming at the phone, 'Just pat him for fucks sake you despicable monster!'.
I was impressed with how intelligent that was 
‚ÄúDo that weird shit again, yeah that‚Äù
Ok, but no bitey.
My kitten makes that exact face when she wants to be pet
I love how he doesn‚Äôt just beg, but actually mines out petting!
The cutest water kitty ever!!!
The intelligence of animals, when a lot of humans give them credit for none, has always amazed me. 
I want my turn to pet omg
This is the most aww thing I think I‚Äôve ever seen.
omg- the cute way they put up their paw just saying "Please bless me with this action-"
Just makes you realize how special the human touch is
This is wonderful
Pet him for crissake!
It's soo cute! I would pet it
Good sea boy
Pet the damn dog yo
I don'ts knows how to otterate it any better, I needs to be pets otterwise I'm goings to be otternally sads!
PET THE WATER DOG YOU ANIMAL!!!
He's very polite.
Oh my God, PET IT'S HEAD, YOU MONSTER!!
Ight someone tell me why I can't have one as a pet
Clever
Yes.
Own...! 
We have to be there for each otter.
Waiting until someone points out he‚Äôs doing this because some parasites are controlling his brain like that one spongebob episode 
Dying , truly. He(she?)  is unbelievable
Hi, my name is rapid-succession and I'm having an "awww" moment. 
Overrrrrrrrlooooooad!
It's so cute it otter be illegal.......................
Ha my cat does this with shaky paw and everything. But then she gets so excited when I start petting her she rolls on her back for belly rubs and at the same time tries to get head rubs and does little cat crunchies.
I want an otter so bad 
How smart are Otters? There's some level of intelligence needed to mimic the motion like that in attempt to say what he wants.
/r/titlegore
OMG pet him already!
Itchy boi invents sign language
You otter help that little guy.
*FUCKING PET HIM ALREADY YOU MONSTER!*
Omg too cute
I've worked with possums. I've played with squirrels. I've hugged ferrets, and oh boy it all felt so good. 

But now I _really_ want to pet an otter. I'm melting.
Finally he did pet him
That may be the most aww-worthy thing I've ever seen.
OMG! THAT WAS SO CUTE! I TENSED UP ALL MY MUSCLES IN EXCITEMENT. 
I got more and more tense watching this gif.. "**Is she gonna pet it**"...? "***GOD DAMN IT PET THE THING!"***
If this doesn't melt your heart, you have no heart.
That was straight up communication!
Golum.
ASL - Animal Sign Language. 
I need this
"You otter pet me"
How long until someone edits this gif to make it look like he's doing a Heil Hitler? Wanna make bets?
oh. my. god... if the person filming didnt pet him i was gonna lose it
You really otter give him some pets
Very very cute. What are they called in German? üòä 
Not gonna lie, would have downvoted if you didn't pet the cute little guy at the end. Take my upvote!
I foresee this being one of the top posts ever
Omg my heart 
Is there a sub for animals asking for pets?
Oh no this is too much
I wish otters could be pets :(
WOW, now I want an otter.

I am astonished

Otterly pawwwwsome!!!
Major cuteness overload. Thank u for sharing such a heart warming video. Priceless üòä
Oh that is just so cute it hurts! 
We don't deserve otters.


Well shit I guess I‚Äôm not depressed anymore 
I pray this is not one of those things where the animal looks cute but is suffering badly.
[obligatory otter pun]
So how intelligent is it to demonstrate what it wants like that? It clearly must have an internal model of the person it is trying to persuade, right?
That little cutie would take your fingers clean off if it felt like it...but id risk it. 
Did you guys know that otters rape and murder baby seals? 
Wasn't this posted like 2 days ago?
Awwwww otters are awesome. Why is everything in Caniformia so darn adorable?
My jealousy... is *strong*
Adorable.
If this video ended without it getting head pats, I would have deleted the internet. 
So glad to see it got what it wanted. I was feeling the rage building....
That's direct communication.
This is too cute for me to watch. Sensory Overload
Screw the pandas...let‚Äôs sink our resources into saving this species.
I was having a really bad day... this made me smile really it.
I'm TRYING to get work done here! Stop being cute and asking me to pet you! I'm NOT going to pet you, I'm going to ... to . . . all right, just this one time, OK?
Cute!!!
Gives it a little high five.  Walks away.
Omg - hurry up and pet it!
Me trying to tell bae i need attention.üôà
i'd die for him
Does the first petting action

    "OK they aren't getting it"

Does second petting action for a second and stops

    "I think they are getting it, omg his hand!  YESSS PETTTSS!!!
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
Pet it.
JUST DO IT.
Knows how to ferret out a head scratching 
DAAAWW We need otter gifs
I think that otter just invented Otter Sign Language (OSL).
Aww, even w/o words you know what it wants.
I want one of my own nowüòç
Yes. Absolutely yes. 
Fuck me that thing is smart...
Little dude is so cute
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Aww... my little Chihuahua Chloe does the same thing when she wants pets.   
Can you own a ferrot ?
During the entire video I was like "give him his fucking headpats"
Aside from the cuteness (which is off-the-charts), it‚Äôs incredible to me that this lil otter has learned to communicate with humans. Like, ‚Äòyou see good sir, I am desiring the- how do you say- uh pet pet in your language. For I am, as you can clearly see, unable to accomplish this myself.... AHHHHHHHHHHHH GOOD CHAP!! Yeeeessass!‚Äô

I bet this guy would be good at charades. 
I played with otters this past weekend at a place in Georgia. They let us swim with them too. I‚Äôve been otter obsessed for years so I cried. I know they‚Äôre not normally socialized but for years I‚Äôve wanted to just pet a damn otter. The weeks leading up to it were excruciating. Did not disappoint. They‚Äôre softer than I expected. 
That's a clear use of trans-species commumication if I've ever seen it. Someone needs to start testing otter mentation.
tell us why its a bad idea having otters and or red pandas to keep as pets. 

because I want them.
I always wonder if that‚Äôs really what they are trying to get the human to do
I think you otter pet me now.. 
So adorable
Sad otter to happy otter
WHY IS THIS SO CUTE
What a good otter :)
So cute it hurts
Smart otter...it seems to actually be trying to communicate.  We need a scientist in here.
This is otterly adorable
Awwwww!!!!! üíï
I promised myself to hate all otters but I can't hate this one
OMG
Why do animals Love them pets doe? 
Can I have an otter as a pet
Full video?

I can not stop watching this...
You otter do it.
This is otterly adorable 
I have never audibly ‚Äúawww‚Äù‚Äôd at something on here, but when he pats his own head... yea... 
That's so weird but super adorable.
Aaaw...
With that face, I would give it my first-born. No questions asked 
I was soooo afraid he wasn't going to get his pets.   Seeing him finally get pets was SUCH a relief!
My boy knows what he wants
If that otter had different vocal cords and a capable mouth, it would definitely be talking to you. 
**EVOLUTION**
r/gifsthatendedtoosoon
I need this in my life 
Otterly adorable 
Why is it so interesting when animals exhibit human mannerisms? And so cute! Lol
So much anxiety pre-pets. 
That is EXACTLY what he is asking for..look at the expression when the hand is coming
Ahh mah Hart ma sol 
This is amazing. This proves animals think and can communicate on a fairly high level. He's putting his thoughts into actions to get what he wants!
They're adorable, but don't try making pets out of them! They're mischievous as hell. 
That's just so otterly adorable! 
Too bad these little bastards rape and pillage everything that comes their way. 
This is otterly adorable.
He asks for food.
Awwww omg. Love it!

So she. Cute. I don't know how people could them. 
Fuck my heart, just melted
Really good acting too. Rubbing its own head with one hand and reaching out for human with the other. 
I freaking LOVE animals, would much rather hang out with them than humans lol
Dear otter, 
I love you. 
The end.
r/headpats
Can I please get reborn as animal instead of human....
‚ÄúCan you do the thing?‚Äù
I can't handle this cuteness!
It's the jacksfilms otter, he's saying he wants forehead reduction surgery
Omg adorable!!
GIVE HIM SOME PETS ALREADY GODDAMMIT!!!
(‚ïØ¬∞‚ñ°¬∞Ôºâ‚ïØÔ∏µ ‚îª‚îÅ‚îª
After seeing this, I honestly want to know what it feels like for animals to get head pets and scratches. It must feel orgasmic 
That‚Äôs what she said
Omg. I loved otters before, more so now!
Omggggg I‚Äôm melting. This is so presh 
Meirl 
Sure , no problem ... HONEY !!! Give me that 12g caliber please !!! We have an intruder who got rage disease here !!!
If he didn't pet him after him doing all that, i would kill him.

PET IT FASTER!
Does it want to be petted to have an itch scratched or is it more of like a loving bond with humans?

I've always been curious about the petting dynamic with animals
Jesus H, how do animals get like this? It is so cute!
Why did it take so long to start petting it!?!?
I know its not a good idea to make these pets. But I want one....
Cuteness 
Darn, this is extremely cute, cannot believe it.
That's adorable! 
I think all animals love humans for their ability to pet/scratch them. Not just dogs and cats, but wild animals, fish, friggin lizards too. We could win over all animals if we would just get a chance to pet them. 
Pretty cool
Let me show you how, you seem slow. I'll just start. 
If that otter did not get pat pats on head, I was going to go hunting for OP
When I do a headcount on kids I‚Äôm looking after and realize I‚Äôm missing one
PET HIM LIKE HE WANTS TO BE PETTED! Fucking monster.
That's actually a bit scary.
That is so precious, I could just squeal! I love otters, they are so adorable and interesting, not that I would pet one, but they are amazing!
It‚Äôs a sea Pupper 
pet the damn dog
It's ottorly cute!
While watching this I feared r/gifsthatendtoosoon
This cute otter can tell me in plain language what it wants despite being unable to speak. Yet my fiance can't communicate that she wants Mexican food for dinner without a round of 20 questions. 
Omg
My heart...This is so precious! üòçüíû
I need to know if otters can be house pets. A friend of mine wants to know...
My heart just exploded. What a face. I'm also extremely jealous of anyone who gets to pet an otter!
can you imagine how amazing that feels to the little guy.. that a (wild) animal will learn how to do that ? 
So where we went wrong as a species is not domesticating otters right?
ITS SO CUTE!

Watching animals communicate with people like that is awesome!
That was not quick enough! The suspense man. Glad to see a happy ending 
Awww. Gotta love those otters! üòÄ

Fuck this is cute. 
Thank you for showing the petting in the video! I get so sad when they leave that part out
We mamals are so intelligent 
World was about to be covered with millennia of bloodshed, brutal rituals and cannibalism ... but you all dodged a bullet, because he did pet the cutie.

Yeah, I revoke the apocalypse.
that looks slightly disturbing
he otter do that all the time.. how adorable!!!
Oh my gawd, stahp it, make it stop, pet the heeeeed
Why arent they petting him! Pet him! Are you inhumane?! Why are you waiting so long to...oh thank god, he's getting pet.
Awesome
Is this a ferret?
The petting part ended too fast
ahh so cute!! 
Sometimes Reddit is guilty of making animals in gifs "say" things that they aren't actually communicating.

And sometimes Reddit is just a real solid animal translator.
cute!!!
Love is all we need. 
r/PetTheDamnDog!
Too cute
PET.

HEAD.

This is pretty much sign language. Freakishly human.
Otters are definitely water cats. 
Really?  Really?  Rips your heart out cute.
I'm ded of teh cuteness 
Ended too soon. 
The more I reddit the more I realize  that otters are far more intelligent than I ever gave them credit for.
My cat who is still young does this.   She wakes me up gently petting my face.  Sometimes my mouth.  Its weird. 
This is almost too cute... almost
He is better at charades than I am.
That is by FAR the cutest thing I have seen this year!!  <3
Holy guacamole that Otter communicated that so well It seemed unreal!
It is decided. This is the cutest thing I have ever seen or will see in all my life.
r/petthedamnotter
Yo is he self aware? Is that what that looks like in those guys?
My heart
Ohhhh. I'm so I  love with him now. 
That made me want to smash through the internet to get to him and pat him all day for the rest of his life.
Be glad to pet your head
Remindes me of my 2 year old....whiskers and all
That otter seems to think it's a cat 
Let him free that will make him come alive again, poor otter
PET THE DAMN WATER DOG
that is so sad

Hmm... You're either my evil counterpart, or I'm yours. ^^it's ^^probably ^^me
You otter pet me.
r/petthedamndog He‚Äôs not a dog but it‚Äôs close enough
This reminds me so much of my dog. He likes to lift his paw and put it on me to get me to pet him, and he uses that same expression. We like to call him a Portuguese Otter Dog.
r/petthedamnotter
PET IT NOW!
Haha its almost as if it was saying...please look at me, my arms are too short to do it myself.
Wtf Man. I‚Äôm listening to the main theme of Schindler‚Äôs list and it‚Äôs just making me cry whilst watching this poor long dog‚Äôs attempt to feel joy.

):
PET HIM, *DAMMIT*
Fits here all I can say is awww. And of course I want one.   I have one on my desk that holds my tape but he don't do that 
Showed this to my sister‚Äôs boyfriend and he ‚Äúaww‚Äù ‚Äôd three times ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I so much want to do that petting thing
Talk to the hand bro! See the hand is saying it wants to be on head.
I‚Äôm glad animals like it when we pet them. 
Otters are the best animals. 
He's trying to be so gentle! üò≠
r/PetTheDamnDog ?
Do the thing! Yeah that thing! YOU KNOW WHAT THAT THING IS!
Haha so adorable. I don't know what's cuter - the head rub seeking or that innocent little face... 

I wonder what their intelligence level is compared to a dog. I've seen some interesting videos on these guys lately and am quickly falling in love with them.
Holy smokes that's some potent /aww right there.
I thought animals weren't very fond of petting for some reason until I met a super cuddly cat last week. It purred so loudly when I pet it's head. When I stopped it would jump and try to touch my hand.  Even when I went away it would follow me and brush itself on my legs. Ugh so cute.
The amazing thing about this video is that you would show this to anyone, regardless of language barrier, and they'll understand what is being communicated. The simplicity of the communication is just so beautiful. That, however, is only the second most relevant fact of this video. The most important fact is that he actually got the damn pets and that human wasn't a monster for denying him. Truly a good ending to this video. 
Pet the otter already!!! 
Why did you wait so long to pet him? You're a monster!!
I want to give this more upvotes but how?
U should have ended video without petting him.. Damn I'm evil
Omg adorable 
That is the cutest little dude in the galaxy
HAIL HITTLER
i would've went on a damn rampage if that adorable creature didn't get head rubs. as soon as he cupped his hands i would've been giving him skritches
Some commenter said they teach the animals this and would hit them when they mess up but offered no credible source so take that for what it is. 
Its trying so hard to communicate what it wants. I will always be amazed when animals do things like this
This is the same thing I do when I want my spouse to run their fingers through my hair.

I feel like There is something in all mammals that makes us enjoy this
PET HIM ALREADY!

So cute!
PET THE FUCKING OTTER
JUST FUCKING PET HIM ALREADY WHY DID HE HAVE TO ASK TWICE????
I like its psyduck impersonation near the end.
*ohmygod i want one*
I‚Äôve trained my cat to do the same thing. It‚Äôs so cute that otters can do the same!
I actually UNliked this, just so I could upvote it twice.

Great, now I can‚Äôt eat Otter anymore.
You ever try to pet a screen?
Holy shit!
Heart. Melted. 
All these people just ooing and awwing - don't you see that this is evidence of an animal using paw gestures to communicate intelligently? I mean, it doesn't confirm that that's what it's doing - anyone know of any studies done about otter intelligence and/or culture? What if we can teach otters to sign? Even if we can't, otters are awesome and adorable, so time wouldn't have been wasted.
That.. is a person right there. Yep. 
OMG that is great he's like "can you pet my head pls?" and the rescuer is like "of course bro" and then he does and maybe everything is gonna be ok.
I said to my cat after watching this "Why can't you be this cute?"
