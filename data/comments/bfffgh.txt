Sugar gliders come in white? So beautiful.
Very rare albino ratatta
*”Who’s that pokemon?”*

“ITS PIKACHU”

*”It’s Clefairy”*

“FUUUUUCK”
It's a 'jump-at-chu'!
It’s Mew
What kind of Pokemon are you?  

Are you loyal through and through?
it's Flurrel! a grass/air type with attacks including *scratch* and *shit where you can't find it*
*SCREAMING*
How can something be so cute and creepy at the same time !
Peekatyou.
Pretty sure that thing is blind now, they're not supposed to be in the sun
r/DisneyEyes
You are the chosen one
Definitely [emolga](https://m.bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Emolga_%28Pokémon%29#/media/File%3A587Emolga.png)
That's the pinkest thing I've ever seen in my life
Leucistic sugar glider?
It’s a Sugar Glider.  It’s name comes from the fact that it can leap from a tall tree and use its excess flaps of skin between wrist and ankles to glide between the trees, and also due to the fact that if a human being looks into its eyes for an extended period of time, there is a high likelihood that the human will contract diabetes from how fucking adorable the animal is.  Ridiculously sweet.  Borderline criminal.

This has been Animal Facts with Whowasntthere.
That’s the cutest thing ever
Aren't those things nocturnal? being out in the daylight like this can't be good for its eyes.
Ooooooooooooooh
It's a lil' baby Paolumu!
That's Mew
Very cute. But people forget pisskites are social animals and you shouldn’t really just have one, it’s stressful to them. They live in colonies naturally so they should at least be kept as one of two.
Scared fuckless of these things.

Went to an exotic pet store with a bunch of snakes and spiders. No mammals/marsupials save for a pair of these little dudes in a cage. 

My girlfriend at the time and I think “omg they are so cute can we hold them?” 

“Nah we haven’t fed them yet they can be cranky”

He then proceeds to feed them some meal worms, no clue if this is their actual diet, and I not only see them start fighting over the worms but made the most ungodly screeching noises I have ever heard and I go camping in AZ a loooooot.

We declined on holding them.

Seriously. If riley reid was in my room cheeks spread and one of these little fuckers was in there I’d be in the corner or bathroom telling whoever is listening god someone anyone get it out. Wouldn’t be able to fuck.
I’d choose him
Looks like ratatat and pikachu had a baby. But yeah, pissrat
Aahhhh it’s so cute! The bushes also moved like it was a wild Pokémon haha
u/vredditdownloader
Albino sugar glider, yeah?
