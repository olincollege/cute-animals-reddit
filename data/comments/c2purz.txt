this is the sweetest thing i‚Äôve ever seen
Little slice of heaven right there..
I‚Äôm frequently late getting out the door for work because I‚Äôm too busy with puppy snuggles to get ready to go. Dogs > Punctuality
This is what I want when I retire. Not some house in the suburbs but some nice quiet little cabin up in the woods in NH or VT or ME. 

Just me,my dog, and pickup truck. Houses are close but not that close they are right on top of each other but I can still wave to my neighbors when I go to my mailbox. Drive into town in the morning and drink coffee at the local convenience store while chatting with the other old timers. Volunteer at the senior center or library for a few hours, help decorate town hall or the church for Christmas. Just trying to keep busy. Eventually climb back into my truck for the short drive home, the crisp fall air cascading through my now all white hair and beard. When I get home, I sit on my porch swing with my faithful friend at my feet watching the lake and the leaves change colors and fall off the trees. As the sunlight fades go back inside and prepare for dinner. Friends from town are coming over tonight and soon the little cabin on the lake will be filled with chatter and laughter long into the night as my best friend moves around looking for scraps of food and pats on the head.

Edit: I'm glad you all like my little story and thank you to whoever guilded me.

That pups favorite view is you
There's those now famous specially evolved eyes muscles made just for their humans. Awww!    https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/dogs-have-special-muscle-lets-them-make-puppy-dog-eyes-180972440/
Dog have precious souls.
from puffinandbennie on ig
That‚Äôs some fast moving water. Is it a major river?
This is peaceful beyond words
Such love only comes from your dog.
Be the person your dog thinks you are.
A dog has pretty terrible vision with an average perceptive distance of 5-10 feet based on eye structure. Anything past that is pretty blurry and hard for them to make out. Doggo will never enjoy the views as we do, so they stare at what they can enjoy. Hoomans. 

Source: I‚Äôm a veterinarian 
Also: I‚Äôm a buzzkill
This is everything.
Oh myyy, look at the lovr in his eyes.
Looks like the dog‚Äôs favorite view was you
That‚Äôs some serious flow with the water, are you on a river with dams on each end of the lake?
I wish I had some moments like things during my weekends. Just look at this adorable üêï....... so charming and relaxing‚úåÔ∏è!!‚ù§Ô∏è
I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you I love you
I thought this was pretty cute, so I made it into a shitty /r/Cinemagraphs [here](https://imgur.com/PMMBUYv.gifv)
I just love you ever so much.
Just seeing that adorable face made my day. Thank you for sharing
I live to have a moment this perfect.
Gawwww. Love it
 Could live in this scene forever!!!
This is the WASPiest thing I‚Äôve seen on here in a while.
Your lake is floating away
His favourite view is you :D
What you don't see is the ice cream cone in his hands
Dog‚Äôs favorite view is you
Right at your beautiful face
I thought you were on a boat for the longest time...
All that backdrop and the pup can‚Äôt take its eyes off it‚Äôs best friend.
Is it just me or is that water moving fast? 

Also, and more importantly, 12/10 would boop this good boi!
Aww
Thank you for this I‚Äôm tiny homesick and I felt like I was back home just there !
My dog would make under her breath whine whistles if her head was on my lap and I wasn't petting her.
We‚Äôre not worthy
Damn! That‚Äôs good.
I know you're probably on a secured dock but I'd like to believe it's just the two of you floating down the river on a wooden raft together
This gif is making me dizzy as fuck.
Idk what it is but this looks fake? If that make sense. It looks like green screen
Is OP on a moving dock?
The water texture looks smooth
That's how you do life right.
r/dogsmirin
Giving you an upvote, simply for not saying "doggo"
Face of an angel, I‚Äôm sure. :)
Anyone else scared about getting swept away by that current?
I can get lost in those eyes üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Eye bleach
This is sweet, but the sniffing and begging and looking to the side tells me OP has food. :p any real dog owner knows that a dog only does that face when they want something.
"What are you looking at?"

"I'm looking at the world"

"Oh silly you, the world is that way, that's the million dollar view!"

"Bro, you are my world."
Yep, dog's are wonderful.
To be fair dogs are, of course, colorblind, so that sunset wouldn't be much competition. Still a sweetie tho
r/nicesheep
He lurve you
This video makes me realize that i need dog in my life
Dogs are just so pure. We don't deserve them, but I'm glad we have them in our lives. I feel like they make us better people
This could be an animated wallpaper
I can hear Otis Redding now...
I try to take my dog to beautiful scenery like this as often as possible. But he‚Äôs never interested in looking at the pretty scenery, he usually stares at the back of a giant rock, or something equally boring. I be like, ‚Äúwhy did I bring you all the way here to stare at a stupid rock?! Appreciate the damn sunset! ‚Äú
Wow
ü•∞ü•∞his noseü•∞ü•∞
Where I‚Äôm tryna be off a tab üòÇ
aaaawwwwwwwwww
You got a face with a view
Now that's beautiful!
Beautiful dog and view! Also dogsmirin.
Amazing
I wish someone looked at me that way
I miss my golden boy so much!
What a sweetieüòç
Waiting for my boyfriend to look at me like that
Maine? Feels like a fantasy version of Maine, if there were no black flies.
Y U NO PET?
Damn it..........just a perfect moment....captured on a perfect minute.
uhm Ben, is that you?  Didnt i tell you not to fart when im on your lap?  Of course, i still love you, Ben.
Happy Hour
That would be my favorite view
This makes me wanna cry lmao
I cried
Wait the dog is looking at his master not the wa‚Äî ohhhh, awww
Good doggo
Needs head scratches. I'm sure he gets plenty. :)
Damn I wish i can have a moment with my dogs like this. Cherish it.
I love everything about this. All of it.
Where is this?  Water looks like it‚Äôs running pretty good.
Adorable that out of that entire beautiful view, the dogs favorite thing to look at is you
His new favorite view is your face
wiggly nose *poke*
This would almost make a good r/Cinemagraphs
if we gazed similarly at our bosses instead of taking time off from work to enjoy a glorious sunset with our pet, i wonder how our future might look..
Damn i miss my dog
Owner: This view is breathtaking.

Dogs: No, you‚Äôre breathtaking.
Literally wouldn‚Äôt mind dying right there
A perfect representation of what I want my life to be like when I get older.
I love you too buddy ‚ù§
It seems like it's your favorite view. Dog's favorite view seems to be you. :)
View with a scritch!
It has been my birthday for 25 minutes, thanks for this present
Does he refer to you as "Dad" or "Best friend"....seems like a best friend moment.
Girl: *staring into the horizon* It's beautiful!

Boy: *staring at girl* Yes, you are.
I cant help myself but wanting to pet him.
I don't care about the world, I only care about you.
-Doggo.
And yet doggo would rather look at his owner üòç
Awwwwwwwww... How adorable\~\~\~
Isn‚Äôt this where the guy heard the clicking noise and being followed by a stranger since he was 5 years old?
Omg, can‚Äôt take it üòç
Psh, *MY* favorite view
‚ÄúAlways remember me this way hooman. And give me boops‚Äù
WTC shoes?
That dog is so content right there. üòç
Ahhhh my heart can‚Äôt handle this
are you calling me a dog
Thank you for posting the best thing ever.
I want to "The talented Mr Ripley" your life.
Where in the world is this?
Oh my god my stone cold heart. We don‚Äôt deserve dog‚Äôs love.
Someone give this man a gold!
he wants the scritches so bad!
What are those gifs called where only the background moves? This would be perfect.
Those eyes! This is how I‚Äôd want to spend my evenings.
Everything about this is amazing. I want to be there.
Careful he's using that new muscle they just discovered between dogs eyes. Stare at the mindcontrol puppy dog eyes for too long and you will become his minion.
Where‚Äôs the bugs?
My favorite view...
Can me and my pup join you?
Pure happiness
I'm choking up here buddy
I wish I was either of you
OMG!
this is the pincacle of life
stop it... i can deal...
this is so pleasing
You didn't pat that good doggo on the head??!!! YOU MONSTER.
Lollygagging at its finest üòå
Awwww what a cutie üò≠
After seeing this post I put my phone down and went and laid down with my dog on the floor for a good 10 minutes. Thank you.
Unhealthy infatuation
I can feel the love. its refreshing.
Adorable
The perfect friend.
Sometimes my mind is just blown by the fact that despite being completely different species we're both capable of this deep bond and love. 

Dogs are the best.
   
It seems that all happiness is in her
why do dogs love us so much
Favorite view = Dog
This is such a precious moment!
my favorite view
Dog IS favorite view
The whole beautiful world to see, and the pup chose you. üòä
This makes me wanna get a dog.
I could sit with anywhere as the background... if my dogs staring at me with those eyes, life is good
Boop
My favorite view is that cute doggo. Made my day!
Looks like possum kingdom
Genuinely that's beautiful. I could totally live in a cabin here.
@uncommonvanilla Are you Kiel James Patrick?? Never pegged him as a Reddit bloke but I know Benny when I see him!
wish my dog would look at me like that

only time he looks at me is when hes literally eating his own poop and staring me down
The dog adores you!!
Looks like willamette channel. My cousins have the same view!
Dogs truly deserve such a longer lifespan. That face defines a gentle soul.
Lovely Pooch!
This is so beautiful
Awww
This would make a dope cinemagraph.
If this isn't the greatest moment of you life, the kind that you always think about, then I want your life.
We don't deserve dogs.
Couldn't scroll past this and not upvote. Wholesome
Wonderful moment in time, thank you for sharing.
r/wedontdeservedogs
If your dog is anything like my dog, he is clearly watching you eat something and you have taught him to lay like this until u give a piece... Or, I'm totally wrong and you have a good boy
Golden sunset, golden boi
This is the life right here!
Wow so cute
Dock spiders
Love it! From kjp on Instagram, I believe.
Cutest fucking thing ever
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs
Dogs favourite view but hes looking at you, you the viewer this is so wholsome
I‚Äôm so Jealous. I hate you!
Oh god is this that tool Kiehl James Patrick?
I wonder what he keeps smelling.
My new favorite view too.
Relax
u/stabbot
This should be a painting
That face though!!
We don't deserve dogs.
Face of bliss
‚Ä¶is you
Can some one pass the cute
Even has comfy shoes
Looks like his favorite view is of you taking a picture.
This looks so peaceful. üíó
Oh please rub his head!
Not even your wife receives you like your dog.
her view my view
Heaven!!!üòöüòö
Somebody should make an infinite loop of just the part where the cameras fixed on the pup. I‚Äôd do it but I haven‚Äôt eaten yet today and I‚Äôm getting pretty tired.
This is very heart warming! :)
mnmm
He wants food, doesn't he?
Look at me. let's go home? let's go home!
Take those shoes off my man!
Watching this video makes me forget all the worries in my life. :)

A dog, a guy, and the sea. What a heaven!
My favorite view! ‚ù§
Good boy
That dog is my favorite view now
My heart is melting!
Lol my lab when I have food
This dog is the epitome of everything I need in my life.
This makes me happy.
This is also my favourite view
i juz want boop why no give me no boop
LOOK AT THAT PUPPER! SUCH A GOOD DOGGO! IT NEEDS ALL THE LOVINS!!
This literally made me cry
My girl doesn't do this. She's all cuddly while you're scratching, but as soon as you stop she's not interested anymore. She sleeps in the same room as me, but she stays at the foot of the bed.
Man, I miss my golden. Best friend of 10 years and didn't see him much for his last two cause I was out of state. Love and miss him so much.
Cute pie
That looks exactly like a place I went to once! Is that at your house or is it somewhere else üëÄ if it is, what‚Äôs it called?
Usually the awws here are pretty standard but this one is special. It tells a whole story
Can I have your life?
Explain this picture of Heaven, Atheists
Good times.
A great scenery with man's best friend, man I can only wish.
a gentle and peaceful sunset
Awwww little doggyy
Those are 25 a gram shoes though
I wish I had a dog
BOOP DAT SNOOT
What are those
When a dog makes extended eye contact with you like this it's body releases oxycodones giving them the same feeling as being in love.  Humans will also experience this if they feel a strong bond to their dog.
This is the best thing I could ever ask for
He‚Äôs my favorite view
He is sacred af of water.

Awwww so cute, it makes me want to get a dog straite away
This is the most wholesome video to ever exist.
Which state/Where is this?? Looks so serene and peaceful!
Are you wearing sheer socks?
Well the guy has food
Soo cute ‚ù§
daw
what breed is that?
WHAT ARE THOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!
I dated a girl late last year that would look at me like that when she laid on my chest. She would tell me that it was her favorite place to sleep. Then the bitch cheated on me.
so cute
Nice shoes.
Nope, I don‚Äôt want a dog. Nonono! Stop it
Nice dogies expressions and his eyes.... looking so sweets.
Do you also have his or hers favorite treat in your hand because that's what it looks like üòä
I know it‚Äôs not but the water looks kinda fake lol
Oh boy look at that sniffer go. So adorable.
There's a cable channel which is just a log fire, or a grassy meadow. I wanna see a channel devoted to doggo lying there being good doggo.
Someone does a r/cinemagraph
good life. i wish someone would look at me like that
The face so soft
It looks like, in love with you
And smell. <3
This reminds me of something my mom always said.. you‚Äôll never love the photo of the sunset as much as you love the photo of your family under a dark sky.
and there goes my dog trying to fuck my legs
Totally misses out on that sunset.... but I guess, it's all worth it staring at his pop instead.
That's my favorite view right there. That beautiful furry face
This is almost exactly all I want from life. Thank you for letting me see a little slice of heaven ‚ù§Ô∏è
Crazy to think that you're a better view for that pup than the scenery
When you stare at the world, but the dog only stares at you because you are his world.
...is yooooooouuuu
He is bored to hell. Go and play some fetch with him.
THIS, is my life goal
Can you guys plz get rid of ludicrous president so I can move to USA and get dog fren and sit by a lake on a wooden jetty?
‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you stop pats to hold your rectangle?‚Äù

I think I have those same pants. Some shit from Jackson Hole, fantastic outdoor pants, but the double pocket gets annoying.
awesome dog
Put some damn socks on
Why can't I see this video?
I hope you are aware that you have everything in life üò≠üòç
Nice shaders!
Doggos are the best <3
Wow I love him
Nothing is more beautiful than a happy, healthy, loved dog.

I tried double tapping I am sorry, thank you for being my final upvote this week.
All I see is white socks in loafers.
Heartfelt post :)
Pet the damn dog!
Stairway to heaven
This is precisely the reason dogos make such terrible witnesses. 

Dogo: "I was staring at my owner the entire time."

Lawyer: "You didn't see anything else?"

Dogo: "I was very focused."

Lawyer: "There were explosions!!!"

Dogo: "I was watching my owner's reaction to those explosions."
I think you‚Äôre his favourite view
Plot twist,  camera man is fondling his own ballsack, twisting the hairs together etc
I imagine thats what heaven looks like
Hooman is eating a samich.
They can love even those who‚Äôst wear‚Äôst the penny loafer... das unconditional love tho
Maaaan I love reddit.. like here, let me hit ya with the actual answer to your question, politely delivered. As opposed to ‚ÄúLETS GET HIM‚Äù. I‚Äôm home.

I have the same shoes. I think they're CK and suede haven't wore it in a while.

Unfortunately I don't have a dog yet.
Nice kicks
!As+2 5in fun s3xzdh
Pure love ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Instead of looking out the window in the car, my dog stares at me the whole time. It can be an 8 hour drive, she‚Äôll just keep smiling at me.
I would like this as a VR experience.
Your dog is a precious cinnamon roll. It is too good for this world.
The dog is sight seeing by smell! Look at his nose twitch ‚ù§Ô∏è
Well jeesh! Pet the poor dog!!!
I imagine this is what heaven is like
Guarantee you the person taking the video has food.
It‚Äôs thinking about all the farts its holding for the ride home.
Title should have said, we are watching our favorite view.
*car alarm*
You: The sight is breathtaking.

Good boi (*thinks) : You're breathtaking!
Omg how sweet.  This post will automatically put a smile on your face üòÅ
Rich people shoes!
So the dog's favorite view is me? Wow thank you!
Obviously not because his head is turned away
I want a dog
Goal: find someone to look at you like the dog does üòç
Lol, no...That dog is bored.
This is breathtaking.
Nothing is more peaceful than that, good post
I feel relaxed just looking at this
Dog has eyebrows like Emilia Clarke
Life‚Äôs finer moments
I see the supposedly pleading puppy dog eyes and would like to note that this is merely a result of natural selection, a purely biological phenomenon. Scientists have proven that the musculature over the eyes was selected by humans thousands of years ago. The dog and your affection for its supposed feelings are meaningless data in an absolutely mechanistic, determined world.
Is the water moving
Or  u?
Seeing this makes me feel like im six again and about to cry at that air bud 1 scene.
the waves feel unnaturally fast
,,jü§™
I love this! It melts my heart üò©ü•∞
Wow! Ignore the dog, look at that beautiful view, damn! I would have wanted that as my wallpaper on the computer or as a picture on the wall.
this is the life i'm trying to live
Sock check
This is so blessed
r/PetTheDamnDog
So precious.
The dog has a beautiful view and it‚Äôs of his/her owner.
Human: ‚ÄúI do war, genocide, bombs... even managed to combine those into detonating a nuclear bomb over civilian population!‚Äù

Doggo: ‚ÄúI will love you no matter what.‚Äù
Please someone make a r/cinemagraph out of this!
It‚Äôs like the dog is waiting for the human to one day bark and run around on all fours.
Nothing says "My dad's a lawyer" like those shoes
Looks like Michigan.  Is this Michigan?

Plz don‚Äôt say Minnesota
You'd think the dog would look the other way. I mean, nice shoes.

*Edit*: Seriously. They're like penny loafers or moccasins but with those cool little brass bars...
heartmelt immediate
Humans favorite view... the dog face!
my heart just melted
Don't fall for his bullshit OP...He knows you've got treats , you're being manipulated  albeit in a very adorable way.
Human‚Äôs favorite view as well
üê∂(with his cute face)
I wouldn't want to look at those shoes either. ü§òüòú
love
This is so cute
I‚Äôve always loved the nose twitch on a dog when they are laying around and relaxing. It‚Äôs so sweet and cute.
Pet the damn dog!!!!!
He doesn't want to see those shoes. Can't blame him.
my legs are crossed the exact same way, coincidence? i think not
Get off your phone and pet that dog! She/he deserves it!!
And why aren't you petting dogo might I ask?
Das love! :D
nice twitchy
This would solve all my life problems... or at least make them not seem as important in the grand scheme of things.
I was the 101000th upvote holy...
I own those same pants. I'd rather be friends with that dog though
omg, so cute
He/she loves watching sunsets.  

You are very lucky
I scroll down like 2-3 posts and scroll back up again to see this post and read the poem again, and again, and again.
We have so much to learn from dogs and even animals in general. I ADORE THEM! With their loyalty they bring peace and blissfulness in this Crazy so called 'life' ... Thank you animals for existing!  <3
he looks so much like my dog !
Those eyes of adoration just make me smile happy tears.
I prefer cats over dogs but I‚Äôve always loved Golden Retrievers. They‚Äôre just so cute!
They‚Äôre so pure and there is no purer love than a dog has for his best friend.
This whole scene is life goals

So, I'm gonna sit right here,
on the edge of this pier.
Watch the sunset disappear.
And drink a beer.
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs
Aww! My pup looks at me just the same when I‚Äôm eating a delicious super terrific sandwich too!
You know what I loved finding out, is that a dog‚Äôs loving stare is their equivalent to ‚Äúhugging you with their eyes‚Äù. If it wasn‚Äôt obvious that they love you already, just know they are hugging you in their own way all this time.
Is this Heaven??
"Yes, dat is a bootiful view, but I haz eyes for only you, hooman!"
So I showed this to my hubby and he replied, " yes I saw this"... Guys I've never been more disappointed in him.
Awww, how relaxing, a beautiful dog.
Likewise, our favorite view!
Hhhhhh
Well a lake can't give pets sooooo....
Is still you üò≠üò≠üò≠
Dogs are the gifts.
*"Don't care what's going on behind me.. This view is perfect"*
This is making my ovaries hurt. 
I look at dogs the way broody people look at babies.
That‚Äôs my idea of a perfect life right there
Melts my heart the way dogs can do the smallest, cutest, too adorable, they show in the smallest ways that they love there onwers so much !!!! Dogz are very smart and he/she was just showing you done affection and letting you know everything is gonna be good. Not sure if anything is bugging you (non my if my business either) but that's usually when dogs slow there effection the most.... Unless it was just hungry. Lol JK
We dont deserve dogs
Oh my heart!
Aw doggo
Dog's favorite YOU
My heart is melting at this
I would die for this pupper!!!!!
Imagine loving anyone that much. üò≠üò≠üò≠
This is the whitest point of view ever
Pet the doggo already
Forget the lake view on a dock.  I'd sit on gravel and let the pupper lay just like that all day.
Awesome dog! 

Nice shoes too, what kind are they?
I can‚Äôt believe there are people who eat these guys
Beats a woman anyday
