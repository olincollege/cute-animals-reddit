whose job is it to drink all them sprites?
When I was young I bottle raised a calf who's mother couldn't produce milk. Calves will sort of headbutt the mother's udder to stimulate milk let down in the quarter of the udder they are feeding from. I didn't really know this at that age so I was holding the bottle sort of in my crotch. Took one feeding to learn that a calf headbutting a bottle into your balls just ain't it.
what're the circles on their heads?
We need to generate energy from that tails-wagging.

Edit: thank you! Wow, I stepped away for a few hours and got 1000 upvotes! What??? This is the most upvotes I’ve ever gotten 😭 thank you

Cute kids
Wow, every living being in this video looks like it’s having the best day ever!
Sure, when baby goats do it they end up on the front of r/aww but when I guzzle a bottle of Sprite in two seconds its "not healthy" and "please stop DMing me this"
I noticed there's a few vacant holes. How do I get invited?
But why are they not with their Moms?
We really not gonna talk about the messy bun...
You let your goats drink sprite nice lol
Awe look at their tails when drinking milk
Where'd the mama goats go?
I love it when they wag their little tails.
It always upsets me when i see caretakers giving their animals soda like sprite! They could be drinking something much better for them, like diet sprite
do they also do this to their mother goat. holy fuck
Where are their mommies?
PET bottles *really* shouldn't be reused.
I too feed my kids sprite
[deleted]
All of the wagging!
I honestly dont know how someone looked at a goat and said, "Yeah, I could totally see this thing being a symbol of a demonic entity".
A while back I lived on a property for a year rent free, but part of the deal was that I had to take care of the 5 goats on the property. They are a handful. I really enjoyed them though.
Nice hair. NOT
Oh my goodness! I can’t with those tails! 😂❤️❤️❤️
Where’s their mum??
These Sprite commercials are getting weird
You know what would actually be cute. If these goats were with their moms. Instead of us exploiting them.
Those tails! I will never eat a goat ever again.
I was gonna say, "why would someone give their goats sprite?" then I realized that sprite isn't normally white
Those tail wags could power a small city
Are people really stupid enough to instantly think they’re feeding sprite to baby goats
Sprite remix commercials are getting really weird.
To those of u saying its Sprite (not in a joking manner) Its not sprite! Its milk! Can you see that white?
I never knew that baby goats liked Sprite so much.
Little malinois watching over too
If there was only some way to harness the energy from their tail wags!!!!!!!! ;)
Wherever this is, it’s gorgeous!
So that's where Sprite comes from!
You could power an entire city with how fast their tails wag
Where’s the mom?
I need this guy to come and do this for me in the morning, but with a bigger station and with coffee.
Those Goats must really love sprite!
SErious question. Is that hairstyle popular?
Do they get a sprite cranberry in the winter time?
The dog wants in on it, too!
Weird seeing the holes where their horns will grow. Hole horns!

edit -- apparently the horns were cauterized

>The spots are the marks from from disbudding - basically cauterizing the horn buds to prevent them from growing in. As others said, it’s to prevent injuries to handlers, other goats, and themselves.
Man they really love Sprite.
They're so entertaining! Would love to go see em at some petting zoo... Just kinda odd doing that alone as a dude mid 40's, lol...
In their night routine: Mountain dew and vodka
Oh my i wish i had an award to give you. I needed this cuteness today.  Thank you.
This is how GOATs named Kyle are raised
i may not know much about goats but it doesn't seem too healthy to give them sprite
Why aren't they drinking from their mother?
Sprite! It's what baby goats crave!
Wtf.
Pretty great without the hair
Sippin on that sizzurp
Idk if I would give sprite to my  goats
Dude just cut your hair
You gotta be kidding me.
AWWW I love it !!!!!
Oh.my.GOD!!!! Adorable 🥰🥰
This left me desiring goat cheese
I hate to point this out.  Great idea except its never safe to reuse soda bottles.
Kind of cute. Except for their demonic eyes. Fuck those weird eyes.
u/itsgonnabemai_ I want a goat
And of course there is a wild pack of preachy vegans in the controversial section....
Those tails!!!!💕
Omg all those tails wagging are insanely cute. They really must love their Sprite.
THEIR LITTLE TAILS WAGGING
That's way better than my 3 babies fighting over two teets. Smart
I’m just here for the wiggle butts
Look at those widdle tails!
Those tail wags
Good idea. We had 9 lambs that were bottle babies one year and it was a challenge for 2 people to feed them.
But but but..... they’re so cuuuuuuute!!!!
Love this!  Awesome work, thanks for sharing!!
And the little tails wag tooo! 😲
Oh my... their little wagging tails 🥺🥺
Well this certainly made my night
tail tail tail tail wag wag wag wag wag tail tail tail tail
This makes me happy
The controversial comments are just filled with a bunch of angry vegans
look at those little tails go xD
Obey your thirst
Awesome. Thanks for sharing.
The tails..
THE TAILSSSSSS
Oh they are beyond adorable - I want ALL those babies!  lol
LOOK AT THEIR LIL TAILS GOING
I dont think they can have sprite
They are so happy
They look very unhappy ......I can tell 
 from the sonic tail wagging. 😁
I need this job.
Goatorade
My favorite video in a long time. Wish I could save it. Those tails are adorable!
In order to train goats, do I need the stupid haircut
them baby goats are 2cute but that hair is a travesty
Sprunk
Where’s this place? Would love to visit them ❤️
I’m taking that one home and telling my wife it’s a puppy. ... close enough.
The in sync tail wagging is too precious.
Chug chug chug
That's a beautiful homestead.
they waggin
IM ALL HOPPED UP ON MOUNTAIN DEW CHIP
Look at the little tails!
Eyy....Milky milky waggie waggie
LOOK AT THEIR HAPPY LITTLE TAILS!!!
This is the cutest animal video for me

How do I live here? I'll work for free.
That’s so amazing
Why are they dehorned?
Best job ever
aww
Awww very sweet. Thanks Dustin 🐱
tails a waggin
I love baby goats!
Look at those tails!!!
Where are their mums tho 😳
Is this somewhere on Instagram or TikTok too??
On our meatfarm we’d let them stay with their mums or try to sneak a baby to another mom. Bottlefeeding always last resort. Weird that theyre doing it here they cant all be rescues right?
Sooooo cute
Look at their little tails go!!! 😻😻😻😻😻
So cute and their little tails about to wag off.
AER! Happy wagging tails!
You should put some wind turbines behind those tails, free electricity!
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️wonderful wonderful .., enjoyment right .., love are animals❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😍😍😍
The tails tho :D they are so cute!
hope thats not sprite
da baby goats!! So cuuuuute!!!
LOL those happy tails!!!
This is one of those videos that is unexpectedly incredibly calming to watch
I love this, my dad has two goats and we bottle fed them with the same dang soda bottles but never had to build a holder since there were only 2 😂
Now I'm no vet, but I wouldn't recommend giving your goats that much sprite
This hits diferent knowing what they're being raised for
The tail wags are soooo cute
This is not an "aww". Those babies should drink from their mother, not some plastic bottles. 
 People who finds this cute, please think of *why* the babies drinks from bottles and not their mothers....

Edit: spelling
This made me so freaken happy. The little tails !!!
Sprite product placement

And why does Henry Cavill have that weird haircut?
you could could power a city with those tails.
Goats are such cool animals.  Those eyes though...  They will always weird me out.
I'm more interested in this man's morning hair routine
Recycling and wagging tails. Can’t ask for more
Reminds me of the Golden Corral on kids eat free night.
Where are their moms? Why do they have to drink from sprite bottles?
I miss growing up sheep and goats. My Shepard would try and herd them, then turn around and eat there poop and roll in it. He didn’t go out to the pasture much
Not a morning person but I’d be up everyday before dawn for that. Love.
That made my day a happier time! Thanks
Yup this is so damn cute.
Uhm... where are their moms? Something tells me there is some sinister shit going on here.
Those types of plastic bottles are totally not safe for reuse - especially after contact with sunlight. They are quite literally toxic.
WIGGLES
I sincerely hope all these animals from this video aren't going to be slaughtered later :( they're friends not food
Are goat kid tails listed under renewable energy sources?
Where are the mama goats?
It's cute, but thinking: Why isn't the mom feeding them?
Where is their mother and what happens with these animals?
How lovely! Seperating babies from their mom just so another species can drink their milk.
Where are their mums?!?!?
Where's the mamas?
Why don’t they just drink from mom?
Me, being the dumb fuck that I am, thought at first he was feeding the goats with Mnt Dew lmao
THEIR TAILS
Where's their mother's?
I needed this today thank you! 🤙
Actually made me sad. Where are their moms? And what are they actually drinking? Is this a industrial goat farming place? Why are they drinking from plastic sprite bottles attached to a plank?
how do you not have a merry day after that
Those little tails win the internet for today!
I almost screamed at work due to bed ng overwhelmed with cute
The tails while they’re drinking 😍
Glad to see those baby goats enjoying their morning sprites 💕💕
They need to invest in the little nipples that fit in beer bottles. It's stop most if that waste and the babies get the tactile sense if suckling.
Omg, this is so incredibly wholesome!!
Can I move in?
how do I live on a farm like this 🥺
What a beautiful place you have ❣️
I love it!! Totally made my night!
I realized recently that I fucking LOVE goats!!
How do I get to live there 😍😍😍
That's too gorgeous, stop it❤❤
All I can see in this is microplastics further entering every iota of our world.
@goatdaddys is my fav tiktok account of all time 10/10 content
u/savevideo
the insane vegans in the comments are going crazy because some goats aren’t with their moms in a 20 second videos
What a goat life it would be
Those goats are gonna have a thing for looong boards with a hole in it.
You guys do realize these goats are no more within 6 months, right?
This is because their mothers were taken away from them...
Obey your thirst!
I didn’t know goats could be so lucrative. That’s a nice place.  Can’t be cheap
That's an eyebleach alright.
Look at those little tails. They're adorable!
Is this dude straight up feeding baby goats sprite? No wonder they get so hyper.
I don't think you're supposed to let them drink Sprite man..
You shouldn't give baby goats sprite. It's baad for their teeth

❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
😂😂😂😂😂
Spritely start to the morning I’d say
Thank goodness sprite has no caffeine. Those would be wild goats
They sure like sprite :P
Those goats look happy as hell , and I would too if I was enjoying the crisp citrus taste of a Sprite
these goats have been deprived of forming a relationship with their own mothers. their horns have been cauterized off, and their testicles chopped off. they will never know what it's like to mark their territory or to duel over mates. they will never develop any secondary sexual characteristics or know what it's like to reproduce. they have been robbed of their dignity. they are broken animals that will never be happy.  wholesome.
Those tail wags can power a home
Feeding goats out of re-used sprite bottles.  I'm sure that's healthy.
Ewe goat to be kidding me!
What a bunch of happy kids.
Thought that was Mountain Dew for a second
Why are they drinking sprite though? Or is there just milk in the sprite bottles?
Well shit. Guess I'm buying a farm now.
THOS TAILS
They’re powered by sprite.
The tails! Yes! Just focus on the tails!
Those wagging tails are a wonderful source of plain joy
Wow those goats really like Sprite.
TIL goats like sprite.
All those little tails wagging. I'm dying.
Cute goats and all but are we really gonna ignore that guy’s hair looking like something out of JJBA?
The tail wags!!!!
Those tails!
C'mon kids, dinner's ready.
Chug!  Chug!  Chug!
They fucking love Sprite
The little tails!!!
Goat boy is cute asfk. ☺️♥️
Why is he feeding goats sprite ?
Where’s the moms?!
THE TAILS 😍
Wherr are their mamas?
Where’s their mama?
Where are the Momma goats? Why aren’t they able to feed their babies? If they aren’t young enough to wean them, should they be separated?
Where is this? It looks like paradise
Is it a guy with a weird hair cut or a girl lmao
Watching this while eating curry goat
They should have the right to drink the milk their mothers made for them and be reared by their mothers
Do these animal babies have parents?  Very cute.
Where are those baby goats mummies?  


Shouldn't be drinking from bottles ya dingus.
try not to use plastics as they break down into chemicals that cause cancer and infertility.
Is it just me or is there something creepy about this?
I wonder what happens if you give them vodka
What's the doggos job, is he protecting them?
Dam never seen so many Messis in one place 👀⚽️
Nice try, Sprite, but I’m buying Fresca today.
I hope that is not actually spritw
Oh my goodness look at those there tails going! Too much cuteness!
I bet LeBron asked them if they wanted a sprite
Aww how very cute!  Great way to get them all fed at once.
[deleted]
Cute. But their eyes still freak me out
 very cute.   

i wonder if the sprite bottles were the correct size for that feeding thing or if the feeding thing was made to fit the sprite bottles.
Omg their little tails wagging
Who won?
Farms, where reduce reuse and recycle area genuine mottos.
Goats have the freakiest eyes.
Thats so cute and a great way to re-use old plastic bottles!
Very odd choice for a sprite commercial.
Their little tails are everything
Well this made my day. Thank you.

Damn baby goats be ballin with them sprites
Momma goat looks a bit... rectangular.
Those horrifying eyes

Look at those little tails going
Definitely healthier than me
Baby goats are the GOAT
I like to imagine this was a sprite product testing site
The goats in the beginning were cute af. They were basically in sync.
I really thought you were givin em sprite for a second and I was fascinated.
I didn’t know you could give baby goats Sprite.
I am trying to understand that hairstyle. What is that?  
  
edit: not shaming. I don't have any hair.
LOOK AT THEIR LITTLE TAILS, OMG!
They are so happy!  Love their little tails!
Where’s the mother goat?
This is everything i needed today😍😍😍
Those wagging tails, so cute.
I loved! It's amazing!
We love you goat lumber mom
Interesting
Could place bets on this - first to finish wins. 5 bucks on the cute brown one.
I was going to be incredibly disappointed if all the milk bottles didn’t match. So glad they did.
Sprite commercial
This has got to be why people have farms!!.. besides all the feeding ppl and stuff.
Have you considered switching to Gatorade for the added bonus of electrolytes?
Bro what is this haircut tho
I envy this life
Them things lovin that lean
Dang this looks like the life right here. That's one cozy looking farm.
So cute
We could make our own sun if we harnessed the power of the tail wag.
Why do they drink sprite
Those tails are stealing my heart! So cute.
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
At least one of those was a cow.
Those damn tails
ok
Those wagging tails gave me life.
And a bonus cow
Truly the ideal life.
Bet they'd be happier with their mommies.

Glad to see they are obeying their thirst.
Need to harness the energy of those tail wags.
Why’s his hair on backwards?
Now that is a set up!
Sprite: it’s what goats crave.
Where’s da mamas
You could power your farm if you could harness the tail wag.
My day is made. Wagging baby goat tails are my new favorite thing.
well that's exactly what I needed to see today!  Thank you kind internet stranger!
They like the milks!
nice to know I'm not the only one who drinks sprite for breakfast
What Amazon workers do with all their piss bottles.
Too bad as adults they turn into assholes.
Where do you live? I'm trying to move away from the city and live the farm life lol.
If we could harness the energy from those tails...
u/savethisvideo
🤨why feed sprite🐀
Darned kids.
Is that goat's milk?
My uncle had a goat named Tony when I was growing up.  He would get drunk and tell everyone how big Tony's balls were.  He loved telling people his goat had the biggest balls in the county.  Honestly, they were big.

I saw Tony giving the bull a blow job one day.  Damndest thing I ever saw.
It’s really cute and all but why is the video so saturated?

Omg soooo cute!!! I need goats!
I wanna raise farm animals! :(

Happy little tushies...

The tail wags I fuckin can’t
This is my dream life. I know it’s not all like this, but this is part of it.
Maybe I should move to the country and have goats.
That’s how I drink sprite
They’re really obeying their thirst
Look at all those wiggly tails
😊so cute
Is this Stardew Valley?
One of these goats is not like the others...
Are we not going to talk about this dude's hairdo?
You could charge a Tesla with those tail wags.
I can't get over their dead eyes...I want to empathize but it's so hard
why is it spicy?
Brought to you by Sprite by Coca-Cola!
Cutest Sprite commercial ever!
Where’s Patrick Mahomes?
Damn... Dem babies love them some sprite.
After about 10 years I came back to help with calving...I dont miss bucket calves at all haha it's fun for 2 days
I’ll never not be weirded out by goat eyes.

damn, so spending like 10$ a day or so on the sprite
Those wagging tails!
Sprite is a good choice as it has no caffeine...they dont look as if they need any.
Sprite diet!
Dang Sprite really out here quenching thirst in all forms
Kids love Sprite
You’ve got to be kidding.

Damn I can’t even drink that much without my throat burning
I’m looking for a Sprite sponsor
That goat at the end of the video looks a bit strange
I hear Grant Hill also drinks Sprite
mcdonald’s milk hits different
Can confirm - crocs are the best shoe to have around a farm.
This is a lot cutie than when hippos do their tail wag.

Make sure you have the volume on for maximum cuteness.
Wiiiiiiggleee
this is the cutest thing i’ve ever seen
Look at those tails go! 🥰
mmm sprite first thing in the morning
Aww look at them
THE TAILS!!!! Oh my heart!!!! I needed that so much!!! Thank you human for posting this today
This is the life!
For a second I though that one goat had an eye on the top of his head...
That reminds me,
I went to the shop to get 6 cans of Sprite and it was only when I got home that I realised I'd picked 7up.

I'm wondering what a goat that long would look like.

They got Lebron’s recycling obviously.
TOTES MAGOATS!
For a second I thought that shit was real
Happy Ass goats, literally XD
Ah.  The happiness of all those baby goats!
Brought to you buy Sprite!
Why am I in this video when I didn't give anyone permission to record me?
Goats love sprite. That’s just science.
Gross sprite for breakfast
Somebody needs to hook up a generator to those tails and harness the energy off them
Goats crave lemon lime soda.
Sorry, but I couldn't help but be reminded of this image lol

Goats really like Sprite!

These commercials are getting weird
Baby goat drinks the sproat
Obey your thirst
Obey your thirst
Those tails are so cute!
Sprite is pretty good for a hangover
their little TAILS! 😱 so cute
this is oddly terrifying
But Sprite's got what kids crave. It's got electrolytes.
We should number and name all the goats, then place bets.  I'm all in on "Tipsy".
r/perfectfit material
Did anyone else hear in their head “Obey Your Thirst”?
u/savethisvideo
Where are the mothers of these animals?
This is a Sprite commercial
the barn scene would be porn in some countries.
We should learn how to harness the power of those tails to create energy.
I acknowledge how difficult it must be to run a ranch/farm like this, but at the same time it looks like real life Stardew Valley and I so desperately want to live that life.
Nice place.
its good that they use a caffeine free soda
Legitimate question: do these babies form an emotional bond/connection with the wooden box that holds the bottles? 

I vaguely remember some psychologist feeding baby monkeys from a wooden “mother” or something and the monkeys would form an emotional bond with it.
Reusing plastic bottles is a pretty bad idea, after a while the plastic will slowly start to seep into the fluid and poison it.
Weird sprite commercial. Get lebron back lol
Why was my first instinct before reading the title that a bunch a gamers were going to lie on their stomachs and guzzle down that sprite
Like they have little turbines that suck milk and spin the tails
Is that cow a goat too?
Look at THOSE FUCKING TAILS
