"Here ma'am, you dropped this"
''Uhhh this isn't actually my baby sir but...okay.''
I like the quick touch and then backing away. 

Kind of like “It’s mine! Wait....is it mine?!?  Looks like mine???  But why did this thing bring it to me??”  Hugs it again, “Yep it’s mine!”
Oh, my kid, cool... No wait, what are you trying to do? This is a bait isnt it? My kid though... No I wont fall for this! Oh...
Common marmoset, not lion tamarin.

Also how the hell did the baby get separated in the first place?  They cling to their mothers with a kung fu grip
The animal looks like it’s seeing god
[deleted]
So lucky he didnt get a bite off angry mumma!
I always thought tamarind was a kind of spice.
It must be really confusing to be an animal. One humain wants to hurt you, the next one wants to help.

Hmm... which one is this? is my baby not enough for him and wants to take me too? or is he trying to give it back? what should I do?
Whenever I see things like this I always think “that animal must be so confused, there’s pretty much no other creature on earth that would return a baby to its mother rather than just eating it or ignoring it. Maybe other monkeys. But pretty much just us”
If genuine, that’s lovely. I’m always dubious with these, “helping disadvantaged animals” videos recorded to put on the Internet.
"Wait... You're NOT gonna eat my baby?"
Lol he couldnt believe it. SO CUTE!!
She is like.. Wait is this mine. Oh it is thank you hooman come on kid
What a great person, s/he did a brilliant job of returning baby monkey! 

This is a common marmoset (you can tell from the horizontal white ear tufts). Lion tamarins are golden/orange. And this could be mum or dad, since both parents carry the babies.
She’s like, “oh wait that’s mine...but hooman.”
r/humansbeingbros
What kind of pokemon is this?
I'm incredulous at how hard I laughed at her impatience.
She was all "bud, put the baby here, dude, here! Fuck put him on the TREE!"
"Dont talk to me or my son ever again "
"I DON'T FUCKING WANT IT"
Me: “A lion tamarind? Must be some large kind of tamarind but probably not as sour as regular sized ones. Oh...”
She looked so confused like "baby? Why do you have baby? Is it my baby? Or your baby?...I take baby"
Narrator: *It was at that moment, as this strange baby was handed to me, that my days as a carefree bachelor had come to an end*
Its a marmoset, not a tamerin!
That's cool and wholesome! Aren't they like endangering species?
The way the baby grabs his hand when he picks it up! 😭
“I just cannot get rid of this frigging kid, goddamn it!”
Baby monkey🥺
She kinda looked like she didn't want it back.
Everyone thinks this is cute, but the mother is actually saying "Don't bring that fucking thing over here, I finally got rid of it"
Haha, that's not a lion
What exactly did he rescue it from?
Imagine if you lost your kid in the supermarket and suddenly a giant hand busts through the ceiling and drops the child into your arms
[deleted]
She's like "Don't talk to me or my son ever again"
Monkey just going about day.
Human: Here is your baby. 
Monkey: No sir this isn't mine.
Human: Here you go. 
Monkey: Wait sir....
Human: Here
Monkey: Oh....k. Come child.
Times like these I wonder how much thinking goes on in there. Is it just a mixture of what we would call emotions? Fear, anxiety, hope, etc? Or is it wondering what this creature is doing and trying to sense the motive of another species like we do with them?
Praise that camera man, I hate it when people take longer than necessary for a rescue in order to get more time holding the wild animal on film. This guy was fast and when he noticed the mother was hesitant he quickly placed the baby on the tree. Good guy came man!
"ThankyouDONTTOUCHMYBABYthankyou"
I was terrified the mom would reject the child when she smells the human scent on him

Glad it turned out well
This is what humans were ment to do. To care for and protect the other animals of this world....aaaand eat a few.
“I left it there for a reason!”
Yeah honey I just dropped off the kid for daycare we have the whole day to oursel... nevermind.
She looking at the human like "What you no eat? You don't like my baby enough to eat? Fine I'll take him back"
Really cool video. That’s a cotton-top tamarin though.
This is precious.. hes like..

"Th..th..the rumours are fake, they're not bad giants"
Is for me 👉👈
I wish my mom was like that
“I don’t want it- no, no seriously- no.... urgh, fine, c’mon billy”
“How DARE you touch my son! I don’t care if you saved him! How DARE YOU, sir!”
This is not a Lion Tamarin, this is a Cotton Eared Marmoset.
I love this, the animal seems to be terrified and flooded with stress horemones but is sticking around due to sheer maternal will.
LOOOL its' face was like "hey!!! Hey that's mine what are you doing with it???!"
She acted like she left that pup there on purpose 😭
Don't talk to me or my son ever again.
thank you to that kind person. These poor little monkeys have it very hard due to their environment being cut and their numbers are dwindling
“Congratulations you are now a parent!”

“This isn’t even my kid”
That's a white-eared marmoset, Lion tamarin are an all over bright orange.  The gingers of tiny monkey family
It’s good animals don’t trust. Keeps themselves alive that way.
"So JUST because I'm a tamarin and a female I MUST be this child's MOTHER?! Typical man"
Took some coxing..But got a result
u/gifreversingbot
it... looks like a salamander
Faith in humanity raises to 2%.
I thought it was so sort of alien 😭

What are these, monkeys for ants?
Thank you for lunch, I am so hungry.
“You sob. I didn’t want this thing in the first place. F$&@ you”
“I just kicked him out”
Smol
Meanwhile, some assholes are taking them from around my neighbourhood to sell them illegaly at trade fairs.... And we already tried calling the cops on them, but they either arrive too late, or, when they arrive, they see them from the distance, and release the ones they caught, showing no evidence to take them to jail. Best thing to do is to not buy animals.
That deserves a giant thumbs up..
mommy looks so conflicted
Wth human i was ditching this child
That adult animal is not what I expected to see after reading “Lion tamarin pup”
Didn't read title properly...thought he was taking an actual lion back to his mother and expected something spectacular instead of just plain adorable
ITS SO SMALL HOW DID THEY SEE IT
That monkey is so confused “o-... ok... but aren’t you gonna... like.... eat my baby?”
If this was the nature is mental sub this video would be completely different
That kid's gonna hear that tale for the rest of its life. 
"We thought you were a goner. We'd already started grieving... then all of a sudden God himself reaches over to your mother and gently pressed you into her arms."
“Don’t talk to me or my son again!”
I thought he was picking up a lizard or gecko..
The baby turns out to be a different species, grows waaaaay bigger than its adopted mom and we get Clifford the Big Red Dog + Jungle Book.
It's insane how well he was camouflaged with the road!!?
This is a marmoset not a lion tamarin. They are not even the same color
“I thought I got rid of that one”
Can I download this video? I grew up around this my grandma we lived in a small farm away from de city in brazil , she called them "nikiki" they are super friendly I have a picture feeding one on the roof
She thought he was trying to use her son to lure her in and catch her too. A lot of predators do that in nature
That monkey was soooooooo fucking confused. It was torn between attacking and thanking throughout the entire ordeal.
A baby primate is called an infant, not a pup.
*fuck sakes I was trying to ditch it*
She literally went "Is for me?"
Not all hero's wear capes
I thought it was a fuzzy salamander at the start.
Awwwwwww <3
This is my favorite thing that's happened in history so that's nice
How did he know it was hers????
Good thing he got his phone out to record his good deed first
The mother looks like she has a seizure of thank yous
I thought these guys were supposed to be gold? Still a beautiful animal!
Jesus I thought that was a giant spider at first.
A man has fallen into the river in Lego City.
“This is **mine** ?”...
“**MiNe**?!”

“Thank you god”
"oh god oh crap what does he want MY SON no u piss off now sir MY SON is it my son? stop shoving him in my face, I'll take him if you leave!"
And don't talk to me or my son ever again!
Homie didn’t even say thanks
Wow thats unimaginalbe god bless everyone
/u/gifreversingbot
This guy: here! You dropped this.

LionT: GOD?!
Is that what they flavor mexican candy with!?
Don't talk to me or my son again.
I was 100% sure they were going to get bitten. I'm glad it all worked out :)
Don’t talk to me or my son ever again
Bro if animals could talk 😂
These aren’t tamarins they’re marmosets!!
It's not a lion tamarin, it's a common marmoset.
This tamarin just learned that a human can pick up her child, hand it to her, and not hurt either of them.
She’d been trying to get rid of her kid for days. Now this jerk foiled her plans.
r/humansbeingbros
Thank you scary stranger
Drop something?
Momma was so scared
It looked like a lizard
Poor thing looks terrified
I never trust these saving animal clips. Like what if the guy took the baby and placed it in the street just to film himself giving it back.
The ninjas are back. Can't they cut anything else than onions?
Not gonna lie I thought that was a tarantula at first 😬
The look of sheer confusion
For me?!
Ohhh, she's going to eat it
The dad carries the baby most of the time. Mom takes it for feeding only.
"Here you go king. You dropped this."
It looked like a weird salamander on the pavement!
Holy cow I legit thought that was a weird lizard at first...wowzers
Interesting squirrels they’ve got in that country.
°Thank you kind stranger ﹐but this is not my ᵇᵃᵇʸ˙"
Faith in humanity RESTORED.
On the other end of the spectrum, when my brother was young he grabbed a gosling at a random park and was brutally (minor cuts, bites and scrapes) attacked by three or four fully grown geese... it traumatized me and now I’m terrified of geese. 😂
It's actually a marmoset and it's young aren't called pups. They're just called infants
Awwww. Happy Ending.
"Thanks for the food"
how do you know it was it's parent in the first place? xD
This guy is awesome.
I thought that was a fucking tarantula at first
Oh wow honestly that was Awesome.🌸
I did this to a human                                                   Yeah people were pretty freaked out when I lifted a grown man off the and carried him 100 miles to his mothers house.
“Thanks for the snack human”
Are tamarins like squirrels in Brazil?
Aww man. This broke my heart and restored my faith all at once. What a wonderful thing he did
Surprised the squirrel monkey didn’t bite him.
She looks so angrily grateful.
I like how when he returns it the mom is like “thank you but fuck off”
I was so scared she would disown it
"Don't ever talk to me or my child again!!!"
What if its not actually hers lol
she gives the "don't talk to me or my son ever again" vibe
Humans-at least those alive now-will never get a chance to have an experience like this. A godly, otherworldly titan of a creature delivers your child
To you for no discernible reason. Is this god?
I do wonder if they actually realise and appreciate the help or whether they just don't acknowledge you're helping them at all.
imagine it wasn’t it’s baby and now is so excited because it can finally eat a decent meal
Why does does it feel like this thing wants to give me free Healthcare and college
This must be the most adorable thing I've seen in 2020.
Lol she looking at him like...what did you do to my child😂

Omg what are those

What the fuck, you mother fucker...Timmy! Timmy what did they do to you sweetheart! Oh you should be ashamed of yourself kidnapper! Oh timmy, tell momma where the weird monkey hurt you!
Deed done good!
why mother so confused tho

"Wait... You're NOT gonna eat my baby?"
Why does his mom look like Bernie Sanders tho
I saw a lion tamarin pup other day it was awesome
Can you have these as pets?
😀
The subreddit name where this came from though lmao. Are there a lot of stuff going on in Brazil?
I didn't read the caption, so at first I thought it was a lizard or something that got ran over.
Good deed done
Sweet ♥️♥️
Thank you hooman for returning my baby.   


you did good man you are a great person.
Awww, nothing like a mothers love!
- BTW, was the mother trying to escape from the little guy and got caught? 😂
That’s not a lion tamarin, it’s a common marmoset.
I thought that was a giant spider he was picking up.
She looks so uncertain.  Like she left the kid behind on purpose and is like “goddammit........ohhh no my baby thank you so much kind sir”
Aww.. U nice human🤗🥰
How did this even happen? Did mom not realize her baby was gone?
super wholesome
Awww
So small
The mum looks SOO CONFUSED like what is this altruism I’ve never heard of it
Anyone else think it was a real life mudkip?
don’t talk to me or my son ever again
"I meant to leave that there... But if you insist" "I guess I'll keep it"
Ungrateful monkey
The animal be like ‘thank you kind stranger, now hush hush, GTFO, it’s mine!’ 😍
Fight or flight response going crazy.
Awh
Shes like “wow i didn’t realize I dropped him thanks! Peace!”
She probably left it there in the first place. Oh lovely nature
That's a marmoset (not a tamarin, though they are related!).
My pup is sitting next to me. Lol
That mother was like ‘Bxtch please, I left him over there for a reason 🙄’
Animal behavior is so interesting.
Hold on tight this time stupid. We're climbing this tree.
u/gifreversingbot
Awww that lovely a kind Decent human being for a giving back it’s lovely Creatures baby
That’s a common marmoset.
This makes me want to cry. God fucking damn it they are so **cute**
Thankyou for being human
common marmoset!
Pretty much the mothers expression here in USA if someone actually wants to help you with out wanting something! LOL
That is the cutest thing I’ve seen in years!!! That’s deff something I needed to see in 2020!!
Unthankful bitch
she said "thank you sir" 😊
The poor thing is looking so confused, like "umm you're giving it back to me? Aren't you gonna eat it?"
Thank you for helping the little critter.
r/humansbeingbros
What happened to the original posts comment section?    
They're so many hidden comments....
Either way, I’d be scared but relieved because it looks like the mother was either 
A. Leaving the child to die for it seemed weak
B. Or just didn’t realize her baby was gone that long and was like “what! Why you take my baby!” Not realizing it left
Now i got that the humanity also excites in this cruel world
My heart!!!!
Cute
How did you even see that
great
Lovely
Thanks for the child kind stranger.
Oh god now she will trust humens.
Man films himself rescuing a lion tamarin pup
That is so freakin awesome!!

At first I was like "thats a pretty weird looking lion"...

Thanks for helping the little guy out.
I thought it was a lizard on the ground and confused why he was giving it to a monkey.
*Darwin has entered the chat.
This is how we got anti-mask/vaxxers. /s
Now - why can’t we treat our own species with this kind of love? Do we hate ourselves?
Messed with my eyes initially and thought it was an octopus
Awwww
I’m not crying, you’re crying.
Mother always afraid of her smallness
Shit. This is the 3rd time TODAY cute animals doing cute shit on the internet has got me teary eyed.
How does a repost reach the top of the front page while the original sits at 5k updoots?
Aww lovely ❤️
Awww this is so sweet
It's not Lion really
They are so cute.  Should look up Pygmy marmosets.  So small and cute
THEY'RE SO ENDANGERED THIS IS SO IMPORTANT
Awwe
Im still waiting for the lion to appear
Awwww
Beautiful act of kindness!
Awwwww I love this I really do 😍😍
Rescue Titan.
It was riiight there, but she was like fuck him, I'm not getting in traffic for that little bitch.
isso aí é um sagui
This ain't a Lion tamarin, they are an endengered species, this is a Callithrix which is fairly common to see in the cities( well at least in Rio they're common)
This is adorable, but that’s a marmoset, not a lion tamarin
Thats great
Plot twist it ate the baby shortly after.
r/blursedcomments
É foda pensar que o cara tirou o filhote da mãe só pra gravar um vídeo devolvendo 😡
This just makes me hate those videos of people on TikTok "saving" animals they put in dangerous situations a few seconds before recording. It makes me skeptical of any "human records themself saving an animal" videos regardless of how much I wish they were real.
That animal is confused.
I love the actual look of “wait, you’re a human who’s helping me?”
“THANK YOU BIG HAIRLESS FRIEND! I SHALL REMEMBER THIS FROM YOUR SPECIES WHEN YOUR TIME COMES.”
 \*A half a hour passes\* another lion tamarin appears "philip? where are you PHILIP! I told you not to move! \*A hour passes\* Philip please come out mommy won't be mad she is just worried......philip.....please.....no
Aghhhh my video wont play can someone explain ot to me


Edit: nvm
That's freaking adorable! Good on that man
So lion tamarin is not a lion?
What a cool looking animal
That is wholesome. UwU
This animal runs in an odd FPS.
Aqui no Ceará o nome é Sõin 🤣
A lion?!
OMG, how cute.
Monkeys are like humans on fast forward.
Twitchy fuckers, ain’t they?
She looks so unsure yet so thankful lol
The communicate through laser beams.
Cute little baby.
I feel like a small monkey can’t comprehend just random kindness
muhh baby thank you stranger
Humans being bros
“I lost my dog” . Here’s your pup kind stranger.
For meeeee!?!?😍😍
Mother is like:Thank you human...
Those are actually cute af
Thats so lovely what a nice guy
This is Amazing! Loved how she was super confused that hooman was helping her son
There’s no doubt in the world why I have this app as opposed to others. This is definitely something to wake up to in the morning.
That was cut baby
That’s a nice amount of awards
Awwwww so precious
Aww what a noble act. These animals needs our protection and safeguard.
I had never seen this animal before, what a cutie
Dang it! After watching this video, Is it wrong for me to want a tamarin? 😨😨
I dare you to not literally say awwwwww.
What in the fuck is that thing? A koala squirrel? How have I never heard of this thing, they’re cute asf.
Bless this motherfucker, bless him !
Lol the mom’s like “wait, how did you get this??”
What is this weird animal? Never seen it before
Animals truly can sense good vs bad
"Unhand him you hairless ape!!  I demand you Unhand my son at once"
I love how mama looks back at the human many times, as if she were deciding whether or not it was safe. How sweet ❤️
wtf dude i don't want this kid
First the cat in the pipe and now this? fuck man i’m crying too much for 8am
Aww! That's just nice. Made my day. Mom is just like really? No strings attached? Lol cool
How it's clinging to the ground. Ugh my heart!!!!
It looks so surprised you'd help :)
It's not a lion tamarian
Wonderful!

My favourite animal - I wonder why we don’t see more marmosets here...
So tiny
Awesomeness 🙏🤗💕‼️💙
Poor mom was absolutely terrified. That man handled it amazingly, not pushing her or worrying her more.
You are a hero lol
Mothers just like, what the human is giving my baby back thank you traveller
I'm a total pushover for any type of kindness shown these days. Bravo my good man.
it was probably kicked out the tree by mumsie for a reason, don’t animals do that kind of shit?
This is wonderful!
Awe hes like the size of a newborn squirrel! Mama didnt seem to notice he was gone either but very cautious of the man all the same. I thought those guys were well fed by people despite the signs and were friendly to the people.
Как мииило)
Love love love for him 💞💝
This post made me smile😊❤
Where is this? I'm getting tired of squirrels.
OKAY BUT HAVE YOU GUYS SEEN THEIR EMPEROR?!
Mom has ears like grandpa
Awesome!!!
Wait where does he live that there are lion tamarin just swinging about? Because all we got is aggressive squirrels where I'm from.
ooohhhhh! good for you!
And that kids, is how I met my mother
Looks like a lizard monkey.
The mom looks at him the same way a Karen looks at a black man
My girlfriends parents have one of these and boy does it stink
Yo don't do this, the mothers are likely to reject their offspring if they smell like you.
Human beings can be terrible but, what other animal would do this? Faith in Humanity restored.
Didn't know I needed this today.  But I did.
Don’t they like ignore them if they smell like humans
New phone who dis??
She’s mad bc she left it there in the first place
DON'T TALK TO ME OR MY SON *EVER* AGAIN
Cute video but I would never touch a wild an animals baby IRL, that’s a one way ticket to getting clawed and bit.
Love this
I'm glad it was Brazil because I would feel some type of way if I saw that outside my window on a tree instead of a squirrel. Like I would be literally confused of the world
Omfg I saw this video in reverse yesterday and the troll got me good I was like god dammit who would do this!!!
Nah, that just looks like me and my mom
Never speak to me or my child again! Good day sir!
Why the hell kind of animal is that
Ok I literally “aaaaaw”d
Omg!! 😻
Aww. Oh my God that baby is so small.
I hope that person washed their hands after
And that's the story of how I met my mother
Dis mine
You can see how confused he/she is.
I hope this great act of kindness will end the horrible 2020 curse that this world is experiencing right now.
😍
That rapid fire head movement makes my neck hurt.
Thank you sir, your the best❣️
Heartwarming!
Where is gif reversing bot when you need it
Made me smile
Those things are so strange ....to me
Isn't this a marmoset? I know they're related to the tamarin but not the same.
Hes so small
Brazil got some weird squirrels
The mother more than likely ate that baby soon as ut returned to the nest...
I think this is a marmoset not a lion tamarin, same family but different name
Tiny monkeys in the trees outside your house?!?!  I'm jealous.  I only have infrequent squirrel visits.
French?
I have never seen or heard of that creature in my life, you learn something new every day!
Sooo this a marmoset.
This guy just automatically got into the good place.
This is what humans need to do more of
Sweet baby...
Sadly I don't think this animal even remotely understood anything that was happening.
Imagine if that was a squirrel. The mother would be 50 feet up two trees away if I tried to do that.
Awww. This broke and warmed my heart at the same time. She wanted her pup back so badly but was terrified to let her guard down around the man long enough to do her thing. Saved the day when he just put lil pup on the tree for momma.
Shes like : "did I drop this?"
Is this reversed?
"mmm, an early lunch, thank you humanses."
Every now and then we get a saint like this
Now to check the comments for the Lion-Tamarinologist comment section expert saying they did the wrong thing and shouldn't have touched it because the oils in human skin are like battery acid to lion tamarins.
I hate to be that guy but a number of internet videos of people "saving" animals are fake inasmuch as the people making the videos are the same people who placed the animals in dangerous situations in the first place. 

There's no way for me to prove the truth behind the video, but if we look at the details, then maybe we can begin to question the legitimacy of what is happening. I'm not saying all these videos are fake or contrived, I'm just saying we need to pay close attention to the details and logic of what's happening before upvoting.
Oh me in tears
Everyone thinks this is cute, but I find it heartbreaking. These are wild primates that belong in forests but their habitats are being destroyed so they end up in urban areas with nowhere else to go. Either that or it’s some escaped, previously captive animal. Either way 😢
#Is that Danny DeVito?!
“ I never wanted a kid. I even told him so. The giant forced it on me.... I, I felt I had no choice...To whom did you steal this child? I begged! With no response.....”
"You found my lunch! Thank you so much!
When someone shares someone else's post on a different subreddit and gets more views and karma than the non stolen content.
Probably scared the momma in the first place, who then abandoned the baby to run away. 
Then this video was made. There are tons of these videos now a days where to willingly put an animal in distress to then "rescue" it.
The person recording almost certainly caused the separation in the first place. That'd nearly always the case in these videos. I know you don't want to hear that I don't want to hear it. I wish it wasn't the case, but it is.
[removed]
This is one of those pre-set up videos isn't it?

Tugging on the heartstrings of animal lovers for views/money.
I'm happy that she didn't reject the baby. Some animals do that if they smell someone else.
Cute video! Mama was probably worried, nice of him to help out.

I don't really get the "rescue" part though 🤔 because baby was on the street?
This is what I needed to see today !  RIP RBG -
These monkeys are evil. Haha cute but evil!
My mom’s work it’s near to a big park (in Brazil), and lots of people get those as pets, but release them once they realize they are aggressive and bite. Anyway, this led to an overpopulation.

So everyday they would show up (because some dumba** used to give them bananas) at 5pm. If you ignored them, they would leave. But the next day they would arrive to find poop, pee, documents bitten... etc...

Once my mom caught one with his face inside the sugar jar. 

LOL
If she were a good mother......
Australia? I want to move and be where wild tamarins have babies all over the place.
Where she then ate it for not smelling like her child anymore.
I would have had a monkey from that point on 😅
This is fake. Why would the first thing you think when you see a baby tamarin on the ground be “ah lemme pull out my camera and record myself picking this thing up and Oh ThErEs ThE mOtHeR rIGhT tHeRe WhAt A cOiNcIdEnCe!”
Wow look at the downvotes haha 😂😂😂😂 my work here is done.
I hate how people have to pop out their phones to film stuff like this. I'm sure the mom would've gotten the baby if he left if be as well. This just seems kind of shady with him filming.
“Rescued” it from no danger and only like a meter away. Right...
I’ve heard, sometimes animals don’t accept their children and abandon them after contact with a man. Probably because of our scent, which basically means “danger” to them.
[deleted]
Most animals won't accept a baby back after a human has had it, poor little guy;
okay again, why is there this weird thing where it's taboo to say negative things about animals.

why is everybody acting like they haven't seen or heard of captive, well fed,, spoiled rabbits eat their offspring outta nowhere?

Or the infamous clip going around the last year+ of that stork or whatever it was that just picked up one of its chicks in it's beak & dropped it out of the nest on the ground?

or the cow that was just standing there eating while it's calf was getting actively dragged away & eaten alive by komodo dragons ...
I don't have enough context here, but it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that the baby was removed beforehand and then presented to the mother. The video is too short to say for certain.
must it be on camera? dont ppl know that pointing something at animals makes them hesitant and fearful of you? While I understand that without it being recorded nobody would know about it, a human returning a baby while pointing something the animal doesnt understand at them is the reason for hesitation.
Seems like they could have just avoided unnecessary interaction with the wildlife and left it alone, but okay.
Okay but that's not a pup
Its mom is going to eat it since it doesnt smell the same.
It will reject the baby cause it smells human now :(
Is this cute or human being an asshole for upvotes? Doesn’t look like the baby is lost, it’s only a few feet away. Mother doesn’t seem thankful to me but scared as the human gets between her and her kid. Aren’t many animals rejecting their child once it smells like human?
Now the mother rejects the pup and eats it
we give animals too much credit
This is hardly a rescue, they were right there
[deleted]
It's actually not the best idea, to pick the baby up. If you hold it to long it will smell like you and it's mother won't take it back
[deleted]
