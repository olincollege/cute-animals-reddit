most successful*
He was so confident it would work, all the way to the end
Clearly, he sustained his injuries from an earlier attack by the tiny assassin.
The other doggo: I didn’t see that coming *wink *wink
Did he get his victim? Yes, then I have contention with your phrasing of "unsuccessful"
[I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... ](https://sciencefiction.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/drax-invisible.gif.webp)
Idk. That looked pretty successful to me.
Im gonna getchu dad, gonna getchu, gonna getchu, nahhh i love u dad
I love how the other dog just smiles and plays along like it worked
When you roll a nat 1 on the stealth check but still roll a nat 20 on the attack.
This is a practice/training session. Mom/Dad is watching to make sure he has proper form on his sneaking and his pounce. Looks like this pupper has great form!
"SNEAK ATTACK!"
Puppy: super-duper sneaky stealth mode on!

Mom: (sighed)....
The dog has mastered the ability to stand so incredibly still that he has become invisible to the eye.
What happened to momma's paw?
*stealth*
Never in my life have I read such an incredibly wrong title. It worked perfectly. 11/10 sneak.
WHOA. Didn't even notice him until the end! What a ninja.
Why is it anything that puppies do is soooo adorable??!
Everyone knows it can’t be a true sneak attack unless you yell “SNEAK ATTACK” as you do it.
That's not a sneak attack. The puppy was making eye contact. This is a form of play that a lot of dogs do. When my younger hound sees my older lab, and they lock eyes after not seeing each other, they do this to each other.
Where on earth did that puppy come from at the 0:15 mark?!
u/savevideo
I love how the other dog played along

"Aw, you got me' I defilnetly didn't expect that!"

So cute😍
Doggo Drax: my movement is so slow I’m invisible to the naked eye
How sweet attact.
Its possible the mother has been to the vet (she has a bandage on her paw) and the pupper isn’t able to identify her smell until she gets closer. When she does, gets excited and greets her with kisses.
Very cute indeed.
Awwwwwww!!!
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.
Sokka: SNEAK ATTACK!!!
Drax attack
This is Vinnie and Ozzy. He still does that even though he's not a pup anymore... Their Insta is @vinnieandozzy
A good stealth attack requires unbroken eye contact.
I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... Watch
Aww my pup used to do this when he was still an actual puppy. "Sneak" up on me while i was looking right at him.
It did work, because mommy let it.
u/savevideo
I think you mean THe MOST succesful sneak attack ever
I really wanted big doggo to look at the camera and give us a Jim Halpert look like "do you believe this guy?".
"Okay Mommy, look, I'm gonna show you how good I am at sneaky attacks!"
Needs Jaws music
Looked flawless from my end. 🤷‍♂️
It kind of reminded me of Drax. "I am moving so slowly no one can see me move". 🤣
But certainly the most precious 💖
I was not expecting so much love!
Good boy needs glasses
Pure wholesome sweetness!
tomorrows lesson: how to sneak up on something that isn't literally watching you sneak up on them
This was so precious
“I am moving so slow I am invisible.”
Lol
I didn't even see him coming
The pupper still continued the mission lol
Ummmmm. That was 100% successful.
What do you mean, "unsuccessful"? The victim got absolutely brutalised!
Aww.. I have the same floor
My cats do shit like this constantly
why did you dress your dog up as a cat?
It may not be the most successful sneak attack but it sure is one of the cutest!!
Woah, I didn't see that coming.
The truly great thing about this flick is that mom never breaks a smile
Man is in training.

My 4 yr. old daughter does the same thing.

This is pure sugar. I hope the bigger dogs foot heals well.
The Japanese at midway would disagree
Oh? You are approaching me ?
Kids are stupid.
Hey he has to practice
That's Drax's puppy I bet
Everyone had fun, I’d call it successful.
But cute nonetheless.
I have the feeling, there is a cat living in that household too.
Unsuccessful? Who’s on top? Lol
Sun Tzu would be proud... Hide in plain sight
You can get me anytime!
Looks rather like an attempt to mesmerize
That was so cute
Like a true apex predator he expertly cuts the injured prey from the pack and stealthily attacks from a position of cover.
I have mastered the ability of moving so incredibly slow that I have become invisible to the naked eye
I used to have a goldie too. They love doing the sneak walk so much don’t know why 🤷🏻‍♀️
Draxs would be proud
Parent Doggo:  "Good thing we're on a meal plan..."
Drax the dog.
Idk. Looked pretty successful to me.

He hit his target, after all.
I mean it still worked, puppo still managed to attack.
Lvl1 sneak archer in Skyrim be like:
she has a hurt paw. the puppy saw his chance. lol
Yeah if you lose your dog in the wild, it's dead.
Why does one have a green glove on?
But his movement is so slow that he's practically invisible...like Drax
It’s like you rolled a 1 and the DM said you are stealthier than the night itself you feel.
That was family guy or South Park when you just focus on the eyes and movements of the character that aren’t speaking.
Mission failed successfully
Nah it totally worked. That doggy jumped!
My father is Inygo Montoya. Prepare to die
An unsuccessful sneak attack, but a successful aww.
I don’t know, looks pretty successful to me
Didn’t even see ‘em coming
Drax from Guardians of The Galaxy Must have taught him that. He's so incredibly still that the older pupper can't see him.
Golden Retrievers, man
Looks pretty successful to me!
Please tell me his name is Drax
Take good care of them very nice dogs

Nice
Me as a kid pretending to be a ninja
I mean it was a successful attack but not sneak attack
I think it was the eye contact.
It was unsuccessfully successful
Dogs are soooooooo cute.
My heart is melting right now
Rare to see a title being wrong twice
It's just like human parents when their kids are trying to be sneaky. Aawwee parenting is pretty similar across species I guess

Gottem!
I love the bigger dog’s smile as he gets tackled. He’s like “oh here we go again!”
Yes young one strike while the elder is weakest!
Mama/papa was watching the whole time and yet acted *so* surprised at the end. And that blep tops it off nicely.

The mother played along though
I name this pup Drax!
Hi Drax!
I want to believe that the big dog was laughing in the end when the small one was jumping on it!
Rolled a 1 on sneak attack 😂
Too cute.
His movements are so slow that he is practically invisible like Drax the destroyer.
The jump was way too cute
Once when I was reading and cuddling with my first cat, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. My new kitten was trying to do a sneak attack. My old man wasn't looking at her and I "ignored" her. She pounced on him and he just gave her a look that said "No. Do it again." AND SHE DID! She left the room again and sneaked in and pounced the same way again!
Pup has been watching the cats again.
What happened to his paw? :’(
This is great
He was moving so slowly you couldn’t see him
Task failed successfully.
Lol cute
Did that dog learn that from a cat somewhere? It was very catly of it to sneak about in such a way. Guess the cat didn't teach it yoh can't sneak if your enemy see you...
Parent dog playing that game “I wonder where my child is... Oh they must be invisible!”
Did you ever think that puppy is nearsighted?
Me sneaking in Skyrim lol
I love how the mama plays along and falls like "oohhh you got me!!"
It’s like playing hide and seek with my toddler who yells “I’m ready! Come find me!” While giggling loudly under her bed comforter. “Oh my gosh! Are you in the closet?!”
When you roll a natural 1 on your stealth check.
Might be the most unsuccessful sneak attack but it's the most successful stress reliever.
He's sure that he's moving so slowly he's invisible.
I’d call that a success ❤️
“If I move slowly I become invisible”
So fucking adorable my heart hurts

The puppy wore the mother’s guard down. Then when the time was right (as in right in her face) it was the proper time to expose itself to begin the surprising attack. This should be studied by every ninja on stealth attacks.
  how funny
For sure, he didn't even move when the enemy was moving straight to him! /s
Failed successfully.

I wonder what dad did to his puppy to get his puppy to sneak up on him and attack him.  Or is training for the militarty

Maybe it was unsuccessful in the whole “sneak” part of it, but as an attack... it was glorious.

Your counts as success because it looks like it worked to me.
After seeing the title I would have thought the attack was less successful
So cute it becomes successful !
Next time he will not gonna failed!
