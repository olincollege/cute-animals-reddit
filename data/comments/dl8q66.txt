The owner has turned into MUSH. Whatever that baby wants, she will get. I felt the love way over here. There should be no wonder why pet family members are a friggin multi $BILLION industry...
I’m thinking it’s the guy getting rescued, here. 

Damn. Must be somebody cutting onions around here.
The look in her eyes is priceless
r/dogsmirin
That look is melting my heart... I hope the rest of this doggos life are filled with moments like these <3
Fuck it i'm adopting a dog so I can share a moment like this one...
Everybody distracted by the cutie pit but don't see the girl wearing CAT HEADPHONES IN A PETSMART. I wish I had that level of confidence.
Man, i hate that they get such a bad rap. They are so sweet.

We don't deserve dogs.
They clearly both know they've found something special.
This is honestly the look my dog gives me right before he bites me in the face for invading his personal space.
I wish this would stop being reposted, this is the look of a nervous dog. Definitely shouldn't put your face close to a dog, especially after being immediately rescued.
I love pit bulls but this guy is showing negative body language. Ears pinned back and rigid body. Not to mention the unwavering eye contact. Looks like he’s about to bite the guy.

How old is this?
It reminds me of White Fang.  In the book, White Fang thinks of humans as gods and when he finally gets a good human in his life, and the human pets him for the first time, White Fang begins to refer to him as the Love God.
I grew up with labs and golden retrievers, and recently got a pit mix. She is the sweetest thing, and absolutely doesn't have a mean bone in her. Better temperament than my labs and retrievers. Sometimes just luck of the draw though
the look of gratefulness and the promise to be the bestest doggie...

Pitts are just the cutest!
Pitties are such wonderful doggos.  I have so many stories of adora-bull (get it?!) pitties I've come across.  I work at a vet's office.
Damnit! I'm already an emotional wreck as it is. Take your upvote!
I've seen more good pits than bad. My experience is that they're sweet, loving dogs that are loyal to a fault.
My pit is just as soft and adorable
What a great owner and pitbull. They both look so happy.
Bless all pitties and bless all rescuers
There's a lot of cynicism in the world today, about  purpose, about trust and about the ability of individuals to make a difference.  


Watch this gif 2x day until you feel better.
So so so so cute. Such a good dog
Im not a dog person, but there’s something about pits that just melts me 💕
Nothing better then that loving look from a pitty
Looking into his eyes like, I love you, I’ve loved others but I will never love again like I love you.
Who is rescuing who?  Gotta love a good dog
A pair of good boys right there.
True love right there
"You are my human and I *love* you."
It's just so beautiful how much she loves him, those eyes can't lie.
That’s love right there.
Mans best friend

My heart is so full right now.
Sometimes words are not necessary 💗.
My heart melts for that velvet hippo
Kindred spirits.

Yeah, I'm crying. :)
Take my fucking gold
Omg❤
Nothing like a man with his pup
You can feel their connection ♥️♥️
the dog looks so trusting and hopeful at the same time... it's beautiful
The most wholesome dog race has the worst rep. We need to hire an  international pr company for pitbulls.
How do I upvote multiple times???
I used to joke that dogs experienced something beyond love, and I called it "lub." It's this level of devotion so pure, there's nothing that breaks it. Even when their owner leaves them, the doggy never forgets them. It is an all-encompassing presence of being, of pure living in the moment and sharing that moment with someone whom it will adore forever. That's the power of lub.
So much love
That's the look of love
Protec this doggo
Look at the expression on his/her face, the pup really understands the significance of the moment. Hope they have a wonderful life together.
I dunno why but seeing this pit's eyes I wanna cry, have to hold it up because I'm in the office. That eyes projects the purest of love and content. So precious..
That is true love if I've ever seen it
Awe.  That’s heartwarming.  That stare!
...and that's why this subreddit is called...Awwww.
I have never seen a purer look of love in my life. Not from any animal or human.
That's exactly what mine looks like just a few years younger, gives the same face whenever she wakes up from one of her long naps
Soulmates
That dog is in love!
My eyes are wet now.
That loving stare! Gut wrenching and heartwarming at the same time.
My heart💖
This is how our dog was when we adopted him, even before we left the adoption facility!
I love how many pitbulls maintain eye contact
You gotta take me with you now... I’m all yours 💙💙💙
Thank you hooman for helping me.
Looks like the pup wants all the kisses
This made my internet today.
What a sweet baby 😍
Incredible lip flaps. I must hold face. Squish face.
It's a Staffordshire bull terrier btw awesome pets the more love you give the more love your family gets
Mah heart ❤️
Precious
I'm not crying, shut up. You're crying.
*sniffle*

What does his t shirt say?
I love them both so much1 😘🐶
Repost yet again
Okay this is my first time commenting on /r/aww and not thinking “this is the worst post on reddit.”

This is great.
Is this from the Fresno pitbull rescue?
Life saver <3
Looks like it's about to snap to me
I will never not upvote this.
Rescued from a supermarket? Lol why down vote I have rescue dog as well check my profile just confused on why it’s in a supermarket lol people are so eager to be negative.
I would die for this dog.

Any dog can be sweet and loving but pit bulls have their rep bc bad dog owners are likely to own pits. Because of this there are a lot of em out there who do hurt people and a pitbulls bite is something im not gunna chance with a random dog.
The way I look at my husband 😍. Insanely gorgeous pitty.
Viscious beasts, aren't they? hahahhah
Is that the guy from Rizzoli & Isles?
I also think people need to be aware of their own limitations.  Some people just aren't right for some dogs.  If you aren't an Alpha of your house, the dog could try to assert itself.  With a dog like this, that's bad. But in the right environment, with the right owners, all dogs can be amazing members of your family.  I'm a fan of American Bulls, Boxers, American Mastiffs, and Mutts. Current buddy is 50% Husky, 50% Lab/something... he's awesome!
Is that Billy Joel? Lol
I remember when my ex looked at me that way. I should get another rescue.
