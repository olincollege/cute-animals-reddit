It‚Äôll be a year tomorrow since Weez went to the vet to begin his weight loss journey - comprised of monthly weigh ins and consultations. He‚Äôs officially lost six pounds and feeling like a new cat. 20lbs to 14lbs!

Edit: I‚Äôm trying to get through the comments! Weez has been eating Royal Canin Satiety Support for the past year - a mix of wet food, dry food and treats. his original plan was 1/4 cup three times a day and now he‚Äôs on two 1/4 cup servings a day. I sometimes reserve some of his dry food to throw down the hall for a late night snack or he‚Äôll get a bit more food if he‚Äôs still hungry. slow and steady wins the race! pro tip: my vet recommends lots of cat nip! it‚Äôs low calorie and gives the feeling of eating a treat.

he gets weighed every six weeks and they review his progress and mealplan. for exercise, I mostly throw food or treats down the hallway but I‚Äôve also taught him to catch them in his mouth (or maybe it‚Äôs the chonkiness?) so he‚Äôs always moving! he also loves toys featuring feather on strings and wire, laser pointing (for two minutes before he‚Äôs annoyed), and he especially loves Target scratch houses. gotta get those reps in. 

best of luck to all of you with your own chonkers out there trying to lose weight! it isn‚Äôt easy; Weez went through a few different diet plans before we found something to keep the weight off. his brother is so slim and eats the same amount, making it really hard to try to have one cat gain and one cat lose. 

thank you for all of the love! I assure you that Weez will get a headscratch and cuddles for each comment. he‚Äôs a very good boi who loves giving kisses and cuddling up to his people. 




I‚Äôm proud of him
Not many owners would actually take the effort to take care of their pet's health properly and some don't even acknowledge the problems. Good on you, you're a good person/owner.
Oh lawd he comin. And goin. And comin. And goin.

Oh lawd he exercising
OH LAWD HE HEALTHY

Because of the image size ratio of before and after it looks like you just shrunk the width of the after pic in MS Paint lmao 
It's not often you see people before and after weight progress pics üòÇ

Really though, nice job to you and your cat. Like another comment I saw said, not a lot of owners would go through the trouble just for their fat cat and it's health. I don't think they usually think about the cats health :/
How on earth do you exercise a cat....
I believe the term you‚Äôre looking for here is shmedium
Can you help me lose my big chonk?
I'm so proud of both of you! I bet you've also added to his life span. One of my favorite posts on this sub yet!
Good Job! Mine has been on a diet for 6 months and complains all the time about it. 
OH LAWD HE AINT COMING NO MORE

Upvote for the Palahniuk in the background. 
That‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs hard at first while they‚Äôre still addicted to food. 

Our girl was big boned and lived with a free feeder, then we didn‚Äôt know she should only have 1/2 cup dry or 1/4 cup dry and 1/2 can wet daily, since we never had overeating cats before.  She went from 19 to 12.5, and still looks chunky because of the loose skin (belly once dragged on floor), but vet says she‚Äôs not really overweight anymore.
Wow, I can‚Äôt believe this blew up overnight. I‚Äôll be back to happily answer all of your kitty weight loss questions in a bit. Thank you kind strangers for my first gold and platinum! In the meantime, here‚Äôs a message from Weez:

https://streamable.com/qp9gd

He will always love treats, no matter what size of a chonk he is. It‚Äôs also how I got such a close comparison photo. #nofilter #nophotoshop 
I‚Äôm just impressed you kept you movies on the same self in the same order for over a year
It's good to see a weight-loss success story for once instead of the glorification and normalization of obese pets. 
I need to have my Meeko start this journey! I will show her this for motivation.  
I‚Äôm so proud of him 
He looks so much healthier! You have probably added years on to his life
We love a healthy chonk 
Yeaaah. Fat pets are cute but unhealthy. Hate those people who give their pets too much food just to look fat and cute. 
Oh lawd he healthy
I spy some Scott Pilgrim colour editions.
For a second there I thought you just narrowed the image size
It looks like you just squished the image horizontally haha
If your cat can lose weight I definitely need to try harder.
MFW a cat lost more weight than me the last year.
How do you encourage kitty exercise? I have a cat that is approaching 18lbs and is on a vet recommended diet but it's not enough. He also has a respiratory history and wheezes, he sometimes has trouble meowing if this helps. 

I'll throw this out there that he's an oddly picky eater. He doesn't like the moist canned food the vet originally recommended but eats the dry food just fine. The other cat has moist food for his diet. (he's doing very well!)
Lol it looks like he has a Big Mac box in the first pic
Our orange tabby choker went from 32# to 18# over two years! We're so happy for him.

I'm so glad to see other kitties having the same good luck, and will power lol, to lose that extra weight! 
Good job Mister Weez!!!
Keep up the good work Mister Weez <3
My 16 pound cat has just begun her diet. She has already lost some weight so I am very happy! Congrats Mister Weez! 
Thanks, i love him. 
Nice. Looking healthy. Thanks for being good to your pet!
Lol I thought the first image was stretched at first glance
My family has always just left food out for the cats. We had 4 at one point. None of them ever got fat but they got a lot of exercise outside since we had a big yard. We would feed them alot of wet food on top of the dry that was left out to. We got lucky bc I really just depends on the cat
Now this is the type of r/progresspics I want to see more of
That's what we call Catcercise üòª
And she is happier now.
Can you share about his diet ? I need to have my cat lose weight as well

Haha isn't it great how they start sitting with their front paws together are cute and dainty? 
How did he do it? Some say it‚Äôs one of life‚Äôs great MrWeez.
I love him!!!!!
Well done Mr.Weez!!
I had a cat named Mr. Wease! He lived to be 19, cancer took one of his hind legs and he survived a whole five more years after! A legitimate badass. All the best to your Weez in his weight loss adventures! 
[deleted]
I love how she‚Äôs in the exact same position so it looks like you just photoshopped his body. Congrats to your chonk, soon to be a small chonk
Cute cat!

Still looks just a little bit long around the belly, this is a great progress pic that I can get behind

Love it
pls share his tips and tricks
You vs the cat she told you not to worry about 
Instagram models. 
His joints thank you :)
How does one exercise a cat? 
Now he's mister breath.
I spy some Palahniuk books
I LOVE HIM.
And still looks like he has absolutely no idea what‚Äôs going on
Oh lawd he slimmin'
He looks so much better. Congratulations
I hate the word "chonk".
Damn he was THICC
Still a little thicc

10/10 for helping your chonk keep chonking on healthy styles. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs just as loving - pet loving done right. Nice one.
He is just chonky now
What if it was two cats though...
How/why did you allow him to get fat tho? No hate, just a serious question.. If you see your pet getting fat why did you keep feeding hem to much or wrong food?
Again not judging just trying to understand 
Yay! Less fat ----> healthier cat -----> more chonkful life together!
It‚Äôs amazing your xcat has gotten narrower as your amp has...
But what matters is that he‚Äôs now your healthy chonk. I‚Äôm glad for you and him.

Good job, Mr weez. You've de-chonked yourself.

Thank you for taking care of him!
Congratulations.  It's so much fun to hand out the treats so I applaud your discipline.
He‚Äôs a cute little fellow!
He went from super cute to super handsome. 
I love him !
He looks like he misses his box. :c
That is only 6 pounds  lost? He looks so much healthier and thinner! 
I upvote for a healthy Mister Weez and Palahniuk! 
He looks a lot better
That's awesome! We put our overly-fluffy cat on a healthier diet a few years ago, and judging by how much more active and playful he is now that there's less of him, I'm sure it's added years to his life. Congrats on a making positive change for your furbaby! He's adorable.
what a beautiful reformed unit 
He is so adorable! And looks so much like my cat who is also a little hubby
Good job Mr Weez!!! Good job to you too!! He looks great! Losing weight isn‚Äôt easy

Next time could I get a banana for scale?
Good job Mister Weez üëç
Im new to cats and cant tell if my adopted cat is overweight. He is neutered and 14 lbs which seems like alot but hes a long male tabby. My parents think he is overweight but im not sure. I feed him 3/4 cup of dry cat food a day. He looks like the after diet cat on the right.

However he roams outside for 3 hours a day doing cat things in hour long spurts. Running playing climbing trees etc because hes a year old. Im not sure if he gets into anyones elses cat food but I know he hunts all the time and seems to always have a sparrow, mouse or, mole for a snack half the time in the evenings. 

How much cat food should you typically feed a cat.
Big Chonkus
How did you do it???
He's just as handsome! 
But still a floof
But still a cute chonk!
Same lil' snoot and beads
My heart melted at both pics! This is so beautiful :^) 
Oh lawd, he comin'.
I hope Mister Weez still gets the big pets!
He looks much better.

My cat was 21 pounds, we started letting him outside, he skimmed down to 16 ish.  He is a much happier kitty now.  
Fit cat gets more sits to fit
He still looks concerned though.
Hey, this pic is totally 'shopped!  You can tell by the pixels. :P jk He looks great now.   So proud of you, Mr. Weez.
Handsome fella!
Oh jeez lol that's such a messed up name you chose for your cat given the previous condition :P

Hooray for Weez's weight loss though. Healthy pet is happy pet
Yay, go Mr Weez!

Jerry: Me, either. Wait a second. Wait a second. Maybe it's that¬†yogurt.

Kramer: No, no, no. That's one hundred percent yogurt.

Jerry: Well, how else could this have happened?

Kramer: Well, maybe it's the Oreos.

Now he's a chunk of a chonk.

This makes me so happy
Should‚Äôve named him Carl...like from Jimmy Neutron...
Oh my god! He is such a cutie. I just want to pat him
Always a chonk at heart

Mister Weez reminds me a lot of a beautiful cat whose owner sought to help his situation. Very excellent of you Kind mister or miss.

AWWWW WHAT AN ADORABLE CHONK even before and after.
Oh wow, he's lost a substantial amount! Good kitty and human!
Lol I thought the pic was just stretched out a bit on the left at first glance 
No diabeetus for him!
More like Mr Wheeze amirite?
What a transformation! Was probably hard work but he looks so good!!
Do we have gyms for cat ?
If Mr Weez can lose weight, I can do it too!
HEFTY HEFTY HEFTY!!!!    
Good on you! Thank you so much for changing your ways to help your baby! So many owners turn a blind eye towards the pet obesity epidemic. You could have very well added years onto hims life, and helped prevent arthritis, diabetes, and other weight-caused issues. 

Congratulations to you and Mister Weez <3
He's still honkin'....

Congratulations on the accomplishment! As an owner of a big cat myself, it takes a lot of work and dedication to help them lose the weight. My chunky boy is down to 16.8 pounds after hitting a peak of 24 when we first got him 2 years ago. Keep up the good work, my friend! 
Since when did cats get Photoshopped? 
Ooo he looks just like Kitty Holly

(Cause his name is Weez! I'll leave now)
This is what I like to see

He is still a very handsome boy.  Hopefully he is even more full of fun now too

So my lard ass kitteh had a feeding machine. He figured out how to get food out one piece at a time. He got up to 18 pounds. 

Now he‚Äôs down to 10.5. The diet is wet food twice a day. Now he‚Äôs trying to gains weight because he has IBD. :(

That's weird but cool

Weird because it feels like it's a different cat, but Weeeeeez still looks very nice and cute and cool yeah
What a cutie
Or maybe you just found a medium chonk cat on the street and fed it enough to turn it into full chonk, then just swapped the pics. Hmmmmmmm
My favorite part of this is that the picture on the left is larger in order to fit his whole body in the picture.

Seriously though, good on both of you for the hard work this took from both of you :)

Wow great job, how did Mister Weez initially respond to the diet? Was he a grumpy boi? 
I'm trying to make my chonker lose weight, but I feel like we've gone nowhere. Any recommendations?
Nice! I got my cat from 20.7 to 13.5 in about a year. Turns out he has hyperthyroidism... :| haha so while my feeding regimen and exercise certainly helped him, he has gained back a chunk of weight since going on the medication. Which is still technically good since his weight was a symptom of being diseased.

My cat is so much happier now though, he can actually run around and play, and jump on the bed. Life is just easier!
That‚Äôs amazing. I‚Äôve had two big chonks and getting them to diet was the worse. One of them ended up getting feline diabetes. She was put on a strict diet and that‚Äôs when she lost a ton of weight. But let me tell you, giving a cat insulin twice a day was not for the weak of heart. Good girl lived up until 18 years before passing away. Anyway, taking care of Mister Weez now we‚Äôll save you from those type of health issues

Can't help but notice that the "middle" of this pic is... Not at the center? Am I wrong or does this fact make this either skewed more towards how fat he"was" or how much he's lost? Not judging I'm genuinely curious
He looks surprised to be so much smaller! 
My parents have tried many many times to put their dog on a diet. She‚Äôs a Labrador retriever, and didn‚Äôt get as tall as she should have been, and she‚Äôs overweight. They had her go out more and stopped giving her people food but she still somehow managed to remain the same weight over months. They tried again eventually before giving up. My poor, fat Kaitie. Such a sweetheart though. Spoiled as heck and always so excited to see me, almost knocks me over, when I come to visit! ‚ù§Ô∏è 
I've never owned a cat, so I mean no ill intent when I say I want the fat cat. He looks like a stuffed animal! No pun intended ;)
I think its very obvious that you took another image and simply shrunk it horizontally to make the cat appear thinner. the eyes are clearly thinner and closer together.

Any advice? We have three cats and it makes it SOOO hard to put them on a diet because they refuse to eat at the same time.

r/Planning for the operation began in 1943. In the months leading up to the invasion, the Allies conducted a substantial military deception, codenamed Operation Bodyguard, to mislead the Germans as to the date and location of the main Allied landings. The weather on D-Day was far from ideal and the operation had to be delayed 24 hours; a further postponement would have meant a delay of at least two weeks as the invasion planners had requirements for the phase of the moon, the tides, and the time of day that meant only a few days each month were deemed suitable. Adolf Hitler placed German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in command of German forces and of developing fortifications along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion.

The amphibious landings were preceded by extensive aerial and naval bombardment and an airborne assault‚Äîthe landing of 24,000 US, British, and Canadian airborne troops shortly after midnight. Allied infantry and armoured divisions began landing on the coast of France at 06:30. The target 50-mile (80 km) stretch of the Normandy coast was divided into five sectors: Utah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. Strong winds blew the landing craft east of their intended positions, particularly at Utah and Omaha. The men landed under heavy fire from gun emplacements overlooking the beaches, and the shore was mined and covered with obstacles such as wooden stakes, metal tripods, and barbed wire, making the work of the beach-clearing teams difficult and dangerous. Casualties were heaviest at Omaha, with its high cliffs. At Gold, Juno, and Sword, several fortified towns were cleared in house-to-house fighting, and two major gun emplacements at Gold were disabled, using specialised tanks.

The Allies failed to achieve any of their goals on the first day. Carentan, St. L√¥, and Bayeux remained in German hands, and Caen, a major objective, was not captured until 21 July. Only two of the beaches (Juno and Gold) were linked on the first day, and all five beachheads were not connected until 12 June; however, the operation gained a foothold which the Allies gradually expanded over the coming months. German casualties on D-Day have been estimated at 4,000 to 9,000 men. Allied casualties were at least 10,000, with 4,414 confirmed dead.

Museums, memorials, and war cemeteries in the area now host many visitors each year.

Please be careful when putting any cat in a reduced calorie plan. If they are overweight and stop orcreduce eating drastically enough, they can easily slip into fatty liver disease, because their bodies will start digesting body fat, since they are not designed to do this their liver is become congested very quickly and begin to fail. 
The recovery from it is intensive and time-consuming and very stressful, and ends in death for many cats.
I need to do a ‚Äútv before-and-after‚Äù with my pet, for the karma.

Well done kitty!!!!!!! 
We've had our cat for about 8 months now.(10 month old) and I was extremely worried about him becoming overweight since I watched my brother's two cats get HUGE. Both of his cats were never fed wet food,  only dry,  and at one point had an automatic dispenser that released way too much food. At one point they too were on high protein and scheduled dieting. I really think the key is high quality wet food in a cats diet and exercising (playing with owner or on own).

So we do the following and have never seen him bulk up even after being neutered. 

1. Always provide a large bowl of water (we used to provide the kind with running water but he splashes his water so nope)
2. Provide tiny bowls that literally only would hold a can of wet cat food. 
3. He always has dry, high protein, high quality kibble provided him.  We like whole hearted chicken kibble for him.  No cheapo filler foods like pedigree. We simply fill the bowl and when we notice it's getting low,  fill it again.  
4. 1/2 can of wet food in the morning and the rest of the1/2 can at night. We feed him Beyond cat food.  We used to feed Nutrish by Rachel Ray until I saw she had some recalls. We only buy cat food that is mostly meat,  no grains. Veggies are fine.  
5. We RARELY provide treats except to train.  Even then they are cheap dental treats from Walmart. He gets SO  excited for them. We'll only give him 1-4 a day but make him sit each time,  which is what I'm teaching him,  how to sit.
6. He's NEVER allowed people food. On occasion I'll let him have a spinach leaf to play with or a veggie i know he can have.  
7. We introduce new toys on occasion and never use catnip if we can help it.  We try and keep the toys spaced and find he'll play with a new toy for way longer.  Basically the thought process is to keep toys exciting.  Dumping a ton of toys from amazon won't hold interest for long. 

Anyways,  that's what we do. I really think the wet cat food is the biggest factor to cats staying trim.  
Nice try that‚Äôs obviously photoshop /s
Definitely still big/medium
This makes me really happy. The effort you‚Äôve put makes me really happy. (:

Congratulations and share your secrets please! You need an infomercial on kitty health !!
Really amazing job. I just retired from the veterinary field; it‚Äôs no easy feat taking weight off a cat. You did both him and yourself a great service.
Man, my rag doll became chonked out after my neighbours would feed him, while simultaneously bullying other cats and stealing their food (which resulted in a weird problem where one of my cats was under weight, and the other over).

It took months to get him back on track. Involved a few stern words with the neighbour and a rather convoluted feeding approach. I also found letting him run more outside really shed those pounds. All is well now

So sweet
Good job on making him healthier! 
He‚Äôs so pretty! Good work friend
I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anyone who works in a vet clinic still around, but I have a question about cats and their weight.

There‚Äôs three cats, two males and one female. B is a male and has always been on the slimmer side and is the oldest around maybe 11 years old. T is a male and is a big cat, but has always been on the chubby side (belly almost hangs on the ground), he‚Äôs the middle-aged cat around 9 - 10 years old. K is the girl and is the baby around 7 years old and has always been a teeny little thing.

B broke a tooth and when we brought him home he was back to normal relatively quickly, nothing much changed. A year later, T needed a tooth pulled (they‚Äôre both getting up there and any sign of anything is looked at immediately). After this point, T lost a bunch of weight and is looking dapper as a healthy boy but both B and K gained quite a bit of weight.

The only things that changed in that time frame between B losing a tooth and T loosing a tooth was that my ex and I split and I moved out (he has the cats). What could‚Äôve caused this switch from B and K being healthy and T being chubby to the reverse? And is this something we should be highly concerned about?

P.s. I know it‚Äôs weird I‚Äôm asking questions about my ex‚Äôs cats but I love them and miss them and want to make sure they‚Äôre okay
Scott Pilgrim and Chuck Palahniuk books? Are you me?
Winter me and summer me
I want you to be my trainer too üòú Well done op and Mister Weez!
Wasnt weezthe cat who walked on treadmills in a pool? Someone added stayin‚Äô alive and made a mene about it. Good that your cat is becoming more healthy either way, he can do so much more with his life.
we wanted to see him in big chungus form
He looks like a Wallace and Gromit character
That is some significant weight loss, good job
Stop feeding your cat dry food. It makes them fat. 
Even though I love floofy mcfloofers when he was heavier, I understand that this is for the betterment of his health and to help let him spend more time with his owners and make wonderful memories with them

Idk why but this cats look makes me laugh 
This makes me happy to see. Putting effort into helping your cat be healthier and happier is a noble thing and I love to see pet owners doing it. My little dude lost some extra poundage in the last few years too and he is a livelier little fellow for it. It makes my heart so happy and I‚Äôm sure it does the same for you too!

Thank you! (From myself and Mister Weez)
Perfect timing!  My Ollie is 17lbs!  He's still jumping from his 3 story tower and so I had to take action.  Both he and Mr. Baby are indoor cats.  I feed them Royal Canin low cal food.  He gets 1/3 c am........noon he gets a sliver of wet food w/water and I add some of his 2nd serving of dry food in that wet serving to absorb the extra water.  Last serving he gets a slight 1/3c for evening and over night.  

My Vet warned me he's a candidate for diabetes.  I had been giving him free feeding on the dry food and that's a no.no.  

He does exercise only in bursts and not for long.  He's two on 3/23 and Mr. Baby is 1 on 4/03.  I have to feed MB separately or Ollie will gobble his too.

I sure love my boys.

So handsome! My big girl cat is on the way to being a slim üêà!
He looks more like a Beerus 
[Neat little pic I keep on my phone that is actually useful to determine if your cat is overweight while also being hilarious! ](https://i.imgur.com/cJqZzwG.jpg)
Any advice?

My husky kitty is on a diet now. But the other one is pissed about it, because I took away their tower of food.
Any tips?  My cat has been on a diet for a few years with special food from the vet.  He‚Äôs gone down from 25 to 20 pounds, but he gets very little food and hasn‚Äôt been losing more.  He cries all the time like he‚Äôs starving.  We asked the vet how much to feed him to make him lose more but they thought that the amount he gets would make him keep losing.  He‚Äôs getting 1/3 cup weight loss food and 1/2 can of wet per day. 
I‚Äôm a big chonk right now. I need a Mister Weez diet. 
And he still looks so fluffy!  Proof you don't have to be overweight to still be an adorable chonk!  Please pass on my congratulations!  And his preferred physical contact.  (I know all cats have different places they love to be pet or scritched. \*smiles\*)
He is now Mister Healthy Breathing
I have two large cats and I‚Äôm in the process of helping them loose weight at the vet‚Äôs recommendation. They started at 18 and 19lbs and as of yesterday the former 19lb‚Äôer is 15lbs. Vet said she wants him to be 13 ideally but we‚Äôre making progress! I haven‚Äôt weighed the former 18lb‚Äôer in a while but I know he has lost weight 
I feel like he had reached the final stage of ‚Äúoh lawd he comin‚Äô‚Äù but has now become a chonk. Well done m80
Awesome transformation!
