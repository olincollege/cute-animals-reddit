This pic is from last November when I last saw her. We can’t celebrate together in person this year because of COVID but hopefully we will for 101.
She’s rocking the outfit of a Californian CEO

Oma, we love you!!
Happy birthday
I hope mine will turn 100 too one day. She is 70 right now and I'm so afraid to lose her.
Happy birthday
This makes me miss my great grandma. She passed in 2018 at almost 90. We weren’t super close, but I enjoyed being with her while I could. 

She was pretty short as well and had similar hair. Her funeral was the first I ever attended and to say the least, I bawled my eyes out. I was a mess and of course I didn’t have tissues
Man, if I live to be 100, and can still stand on my own power and still have my mental faculties? That would be pretty sweet.
Your grandma looks ready to take on another 100 easy. She's like "bring it on". Many happy returns of the day!
Happy Bday Oma! Its mine too!
Happy birthday Oma!
congrats oma!! :)
Two world wars, unbelievable. Congrats to her! My grandma is 92.
Happy b’day lovely lady. 💓
Immortals by imagine dragons starts to play.

No offence, but your Oma is absolutely tiny
Happy birthday to her!! I didn't know anyone else called their grandmother Oma- I'm not sure why we did, but my grandma on my dad's side was Oma and grandad was K-pa.
Happy 100th birthday Oma!
Oma goodness she’s getting old
I hope my Oma lives that long too! 100 is a big number!
Happy birthday oma 🥰 I haven’t met you but you seem like a lovely person.
She looks like she's a giant and you're more giant.

Makes me miss my oma! Congratulations
Many many congratulations
Your oma has the same pants and shoes are radioheads Thom Yorke

Gefeliciteerd uit Nederland, Oma! IDK if she's German, Dutch, or any other nationality where the name for grandmother is *oma* but oma lovers unite.
Congratulations to your Oma!
Tell her happy birthday from central Canada! 🎂
Happy Birthday to her!!!!!
Happy Birthday!
One of my goals tbh
Gelukkige verjaardag!!
What happened to your feet?
OMA GOODNESS
Is oma Dutch or German?
So what country are you from/language do you speak? I’ve been watching Kim’s convenience and it’s about a Korean family and I believe she calls her mom Umma. Interesting that it’s spelled pretty similarly.
It's pretty much guaranteed that if you use the word oma you are referring to a 4ft tall hunchback master chef with a fondness for deli meats
Tell your oma I love her with all my heart and that her shoes are sick as fuck, i hope she has a happy birthday :)
Cool
I need a banana for scale.
Mozel Tov! 100 years, Keinehora!
Happy birthday Oma!
She doesn't look that old, she has beautiful hair, and I bet you love her
She looks like she’s a pistol and full of personality and wisdom.  You are blessed to still have her.  At least you can face time and do a zoom party maybe.  Give her a virtual hug from us.  Stay masked and safe.  Bless you and your family.
What’s an Oma? I’m assuming grandmother, but what language, or where are you from?

Great pic btw!
My opa. Escaped three prisoner of war camps and the last one a guard asked him for cigarettes after he escaped he went into a shop some years later and the shop owner gave him the box of cigarettes back.
literally nobody says "aww" from this. go to r/nextlevel or something.
I had 2 Oma's.... how lucky you are!!!! My Oma G passed away in 2012 and I miss her everyday. Was so close to her.
She can't play with legos anymore
NGL she kinda look like mr bean
Happy Birthday!

There is so much love in this picture. Happy birthday Oma!
I dont mean to be a downer, but this reminds me of my oma who we lost a few years ago to ALS, please spend as much time as you can with her. My oma was almost like a second mom to me and I still think of her quite often, I'm not upset that she died, she lived a very good life, I just wish she got to meet my daughter.
Happy birthday Oma.  And you’re cute!
That’s a scary lookin ventriloquist doll
Oma - "I made you boy... I can unmake you!"
You must mean 100 cm because she does not look a day past 80 =) 

Happy birthday to her. You are blessed to have her around still. Treasure it

Dude how tall are you
13 years until she can make a return to r/teenagers
She killed fiddy men!
Pocket grandma!

Van harte gefeliciflapstaart met je oma!
Happy birthday Oma!
Happy Birthday Oma.
Happiest of Birthdays to your Awesome Oma!
She's tall! Also, what happened to your legs?
Oma? Are you happen to be either from Dutch or German descent?
Are you German?
Oh my god what happened to your legs?
I don't think even Python can calculate 100!!
Happy cake day Oma.
bless her she looks fantastic ❣ to many more 💓
Happy birthday Oma! Today I'm 50.  You are exactly double my age!!!! ❤
Anything that makes me spot handful german words I remember makes me happy
Despite the crushing loss of the patriarch, Tim Conway.  It's always good to see the surviving Dorf Family get together for a photograph.
I absolutely love that you call your grandma Oma, as I also did this.  My Oma made it 107, must get something in the name!
I don't wish to alarm you, but your feet seem to have detached from your legs
happy birthday oma! sorry you can't have a party!!
Oma looking strong!

That boy was brought to his knees! :D
My question is now, in how many languages do say "oma" as granny? I only know Germany
Happy birthday to the amazing lady! 

She is the perfect definition of ‘tiny but mighty’. I hope she has a great day.
Happy birthday to a beautiful woman
she’s so cute!! Happy birthday to your oma!
Short chicks are hot! 😛👨‍🚒
Oma god that bitch old as fuck
Oh my
Happy Birthday Oma!!!!!!! XXXOOO
Look at that hungry mouth
Did you lose your shins down in an accident?
First time I ever had the thought, “you’re more than a lower leg taller than her.”
Happy Birthday!
Happy flippin birthday! Also sorry about what happened to your legs
Today is my birthday too
What does Oma mean? Never heard that word before


Gratulations BTW
Happy birthday
Blessings!
I love her and her shoes so much
Tall men kneel for their Omas.
Happy 100th
She tell you any good stories? I would love to hear from someone who has seen so much change.
Feel like I’m looking into another dimension, bro my Oma turns 100 on the 23rd! Same thing we can’t celebrate with her because of Covid 😔 

Mine is also super short and I’m really tall 😆
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
Congrats to Oma turning 100
Happy bday Oma love you
She couldn’t be more happier that you are there with her
Happy Centennial Dear!!!
Wait what’s a oma
Is Oma Dutch?
I thought this guy had super short legs for a whole minute
Like, sometimes, when I see photos like this, I ask myself... is it worth it?

I'm super happy your Oma is still on this Earth with us!  I just wondering... within the confines of what I defy as my own happiness... is living to 101 worth it?  I'm 36 now, and I'm already feeling the pains of age.  It's only going to get worse.  I have two kids that I love dearly.  By the time I'm 70, they'll be into their 30's, no doubt doing the same 30's shenanigans their old man used to get into.  A beautiful wife that I could never live without, but understands the point I'm trying to make here...

I don't know, man.  I think 70-75 is that sweet spot to call it a life.
Wishing your grandmother a wonderful and happy birthday!
I love the term “Oma”. Sounds so sweet. Might start calling my grandma this.
Happy birthday!
Woow
Just lost my Oma this year (of old age, not covid thankfully). Hope you guys can together again soon!
OMA god! She's 100!
Lmaooo she gang as hell let’s go
Happy Birthday Oma! Make sure you ask your grandson to have your rollator close to you before he leaves. And lock your brakes!
That’s such an adorable photo 😀
I see he lost his feet to the diabetes.
Ur oma looks like a very innocent lady. No crimes, no yelling, and no sin. She looks pure
Damn dude, your Oma is tall, also why is your chest so long in comparison to your legs.
Happy birthday to her!! ❤️
Turns 100 what? Tricks. Lights on. The page? Don't leave me hangin mate
So women do get shorter as they age. I just thought it was my family.
I wish to her to be a teenager again! Another 13 years and she will be 113!
Congratulation! My aunt turned 80 today and I'm so happy that she made it. I hope she makes it to 100 ;)
Happy birthday Oma!!

Omg she looks incredible! Easily would have believed she was much younger
Well we know where you get your height from
Met a lady 103 years old. I asked her what the secret was. She says “one glass of whiskey and one cigarette a day. You have to manage your stress first”
Damn, for a second I thought this was a r/streetwear post.
Omajan
is Oma her name because it is capitalized? or is it Oma because you are a Dutch person / another country where oma means grandma

edit: nevermind, I found it, for the people didn’t know either, he is German and Grandma and Grandpa means Oma and Opa
Happy birthday sweet Oma!!!🎂🎁🎈💐❤️
OmaaaaaGosh she’s old! Happy birthday!
Wow the stories this lady could probably tell about the changing of times, from the 50s to the 60s 70s 80s 90s 2000s 2010s Id love to hear hear talk about her view on each of these, heck she was very young during the times of world war 2 but Im sure she does remember some stuff about that too, best wishes!
AWWWWWWEEEEEEEE!!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY OMA!
centimeters?
Why did she put shoes on her knees?

Happy cake dayy!!!!

Oh no, she can't play with legos anymore!
🙏🏾
Happy birthday OG
Happy birthday to her from Canada
They seem to get smaller as they age don't they ? I have a theory that some old ladies just shrink to a subatomic level instead of dying
Beautiful!
My Oma passed away a few years ago. I miss her dearly and would have hoped to be able to have her when I got married. Please wish your Oma the best from me. Tell her that we love her lots and we wish her the best 100th.
Them kicks tho 🔥
Don't do this to me when I'm tired. Im gonna get nightmares about your legs there
OP and all you other with older (90+) grandparents, I hope you are getting them to write their stories or getting them on video! Get their take on the wars and hard times they have seen, then get their perspective of the peaceful times as well. I wish I had recorded or written down what my grandfather told me about Pearl Harbor. I just have a vague memory of us sitting out on the patio, him telling me about being off base when the bombs struck PH and jumping into their cars to get there. So, crazy! He was blessed to not have been on board when the bombs hit, he was an Ensign in the Navy.
I share a birthday with your Oma! I hope to see 100 as well!
Congratulations to your grandma ☺️
Does not look a day older than 99
happy birthday to your oma!!!!!!
well if you can see her tell her i said happy birthday
Happy Birthday I'ma! I hope you get to have a special day together next year!
Wow, what a life she has lived thus far! alles Gute zum Geburtstag, Oma! P.s. is she still living in Chicago?
Happy 100th Birthday , Oma. I hope you enjoy your day. Wishing you health and happiness.
Gratz
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
Bless you on your birthday, Oma❤️
My granny was Oma too!
Lovely picture, happy birthday!
Alles gute zum Geburtstag, Oma!
🎶I got no strings, to hold me down...🎶
How's her mind?
Happiest of birthdays to her!! What an amazing accomplishment!! I remember my great aunt who was 103 at the time saying it was harder to give up driving than it was giving up sex as she got older, and I still laugh about it! The woman loved to drive!
This is so amazing, I sadly lost my Oma last year. I wish a happy birthday to yours!
I’m not trying to be cynically, I wish you the best of luck for 101. She looks so happy.
... Centimeters.

Joking aside, Happy Birthday Oma!
Happy Birthday Oma...you look marvelous!
Literally no where does an insult like that fit into the world. But thanks for showing me there are still people who need to be educated! And so properly placed on Oma’s bday post man, excellent choice!
This is a sad day
Are you huge or is she tiny? Happy b day m’am
happy bday!
My Oma just turned 91. Hope she makes it to 100 and more. And me as well.
Long live Oma
Happy Birthday to your Oma

At my great grandmas 100th bday, little me made well over $100 in tips running all over the big hall her bday was at and filling up peoples wine glasses. Just picture a lil adhd crackhead with red and white wine bottles in her tiny hands/arms runnin around fillin up wine glasses. I felt powerful.

Happy 100 birthday
I just lost my Oma so please give yours an extra long hug! Prost Oma!
Man, your Oma is 115% gangsta.
Such an awesome picture! Sorry you lost your feet.
I call my grandfather "Paca" because when my big sister was little, she didn't like the way "Opa" sounded so she said "Paca" and that stuck with him. So whenever I visit my grandparents house, I refer to it as Oma and Paca's.
100% would wear! 👌
HBD!
Happy birthday 🎈
