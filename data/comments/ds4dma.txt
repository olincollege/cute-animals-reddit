He‚Äôs a dainty 27 pounds.
Mainecoons are a total gift. My parents used to have one, he was by far the best tempered cat
Jesus did your mother adopt a snow leopard? Did she know they're endangered?

Smol kitten Bob.  Trying to find more - my mom doesn‚Äôt post anything online lol.
HOO boy that‚Äôs a big cat, bet you can snuggle that for days
Bob looks like a landlord who's heard every short-on-the-rent-this-month story in the book.
Every time I see giant kitties like this, I feel the urge to get one to complement my tiny short-haired ginger cat and my large medium-haired tuxedo cat so I have a three-step size and fluffiness gradient of cats.

But no... I shouldn't...

Edit: Reddit, I'm not gonna get a new giant floofer yet. Space is the biggest concern, but not the only one. Thank you for being encouraging though.
Maine Coons are the best breed ever.  They are also a good breed if you are a dog lover and can't have a dog.

Cat hardware, dog software.  Mine plays fetch, follows me around the house wagging her tail, and is the most talkative cat I've ever seen.

Bob looks like he skipped a part of evolution into a house cat

Finally, some good fucking OC. I love Bob.

I was ganna get a cat because I thought I had a problem with mice, turns out it was raccoons so instead I got a CAT
That‚Äôs a bob cat
Bob is a Big Boy.
That is a lynx and should be returned to the wild! üòè
r/girlswithhugepussys
Huh...I thought Costco only sold giant bears...
bruh thats a lynx
I love Bob.
BOB DO SOMETHING
How heavy is he? I have 2 male Maine Coons that weigh in at 25 and 22.5 lbs. They're good sized but I don't think they're as big as Bob here...
Mommy is cute
I love Bob's /r/toefeathers
Maine Coons are the best (owned by two). Does he have the best chirp?
That there's a Robert
Reminds me of a guy at work who adopted his BIL's cat after he passed away. Had it for over 3 years before he found out that it's a legit bobcat after he was showing pics of him to us.
Kept telling him it was and didn't believe us until he had to take it to the vet. They asked if he had the exotic pet license required to keep it. After he explained the situation the vet let it slide that one time until he got his paperwork in order.
His BIL apparently got it from a free box of kittens someone had at a flea market. It was the last one in there and he told it if it was still there when he left he would take him home, and he did.
So now he has a very well taken care of 25lb bobcat living in his apartment. Thing acts just like a regular old cat too, it's funny.
I used to have a big cat named Bob!  He was a Maine Coon and he was a [bright orange cat.](https://i.imgur.com/rfBcn88.png)  And he was dumb as a stump, but so sweet.  He liked to eat Doritos.
This is so great on so many levels for me... My dad was a lifelong dog person who lost his 17 year old Jack Russell (named Bob!) about 5 years ago. Until about a year ago, he was pet-less after Bob passed and was very reluctant to consider getting a cat. (dog was no longer an option due to life changes) When he finally did relent, he found a 20 lb Maine Coon rescue, and I can't remember the last time my pops was as happy as he's been since Clyde came into his life.

 Basically Maine Coons are the best and Bob is a great name for any animal! :)
Also, although not as big and interesting as my mom‚Äôs cat, you can follow my baby skunk, cat, and dog @zooarcade on Instagram if you want to see a cute furmily!
chicks hot
Who needs a dog when you can have a Main Coon guarding your house!

Not to be dramatic, but I would die for Bob.
Your mom has a really beautiful smile.
Bob is tired of your mom's shit.
Is that a Norwigian forest cat? I have a half breed and it's not as big as one but it sure is fluffy!
Bob doesn‚Äôt look happy.
Bob is a big cat
Oh my god ...He must be so heavy ...
He is handsome and I love him
Big cat Bob gonna fillet yo face...

The sheer size of the lad..

I'm assuming Bob stands for "Big Ol' Bastard"? Seriously though that is the coolest cat I've ever seen.
This has to be some foreground background shit right?!? Cause that cat is huge!

That's a fucking snow leopard lol
r/GirlsWithHugePussies would love this
He probably shits like a man.
That‚Äôs a fucking Bob cat üòÇ
That almost looks like it can't be real. I had a Maine Coon, though, so I know it is.

They look like wildcats.
That‚Äôs a true main coon.  I adopted a half from the APL. Even half is massive.  The thing about these guys is theyre cuddle mongers. It‚Äôs a literally like having a cat dog.  I also adopted a Siberian, they‚Äôre kind a like miniature Maine coon. Now I just adopt strays LOL
Please send more Bob picss
"a khajiit has wares"
I wanna be friends with bob
Yeah, our Maine Coon is named PuppyCat - cat hardware running dog software.
Maine Coon boyo
I had a childhood cat named Bob. We got made fun of for our cat's name sometimes, but I didn't mind. He was a good cat.
How dare you have such a generic name for this cat it deserves a magnificent name such as mufasa
Bob is magnificent!

I have a big boy too, he has to use extra long litter boxes, or he quite nonchalantly pees on the floor and spends a good amount of his napping time digging in the air and expecting his pee to be magically covered. He's a pretty boy, not a smart one.
Bob, Destroyer of Litter-box
Holy cow that's like a hairy toddler! üòÇ
I guess you could say he's a bob...cat.

What a magnificent cat!
Bob looks thoroughly nonplussed.
the term is Bob cat
Looking around this photo, I gather that the cat is currently visiting the veterinarian. Are those electric shavers in the background? Would you send me a photo of the cat after you shave him?
Serious question...
What do you have to use as a cat box?
great name.!     My name is Bob. I run security around here.
Big mr fluffers
I'd be worried a little if one of those got mad at me.

Bob is THE SECURITY SYSTEM

TIL household cats can be the size of a small vehicle.
I'm no cat expert but I don't think that's just your every day feline.
I'm generally not afraid of cats, but this thing is like the Rottweiler version of a cat. Not sure I could sleep at night, unless I very much trusted it.
I just wanna hug Bob....but I feel like he could eat me...
Looks like he goes by Robert.  I‚Äôd even go so far as to address him as ‚ÄúSir‚Äù.

He looks ready to fuck someone or something up.
It think you spelt Bobcat wrong
Is it a Maine coon? I had one in my teens named Oliver. He was a big boy. Weighed 11 kg.
Is that her cat, Bob, or her bobcat?
So he's a Bob cat?
My Maine Coon is 31 lbs. last I checked
**MOW**
That's a bobcat!
So his name is Bob cat then? That sounds puurrrfect...wow I can't believe I actually did that.

Holy cow!  If Mom got a lynx she‚Äôd be downsizing!
Any one else read it as my mom's big Bob cat?
That's no moon...

Beautiful.

I ended up with a Siberian (female) and she only weights in at like 4.6, I don't know the size of the woman here but it's got to be impressive regardless. How do dogs reacts when they see him?
This is more like "ACK!" then "AWW"; y'all must be close to a nuke plant or something?

In America, you pet cat. In Soviet Russia, cat pet you.
I think i'm the only person that saw this and thought ... wow the redditors are getting younger and younger every time. Look this person is posting a picture of their mom and she looks 23.
When does it stop being a cat and becomes a Bobcat?
Cat is cute but vet is even cuter
Now I understand why people sometimes mistake maine coons for bobcats.
it is bobcat
I feel like a cat this big deserves a promotion to another animal.  What happens when you accidentally wiggle your feet under the sheets?   This one looks like it might make off with a toe.
Epic toe tufts!
Im pretty sure thats a fuckin bobcat
Wow, must have one heck of a litter box for that fellow. He is beautiful.
#vegancat
I like how you can clearly see the vet's joy in meeting this big boi
Plot twist. It's a normal sized cat and the woman is freakishly tiny.
His father was a lynx. His mother was surprised.
Your mom is low key hot tho

That's a cat that deserves a real name.  Couldn't name a beast like that Sprinkles or something.
I refuse to believe thats a cat

Dude there's always misleading pictures with perspective on the internet, but even at the best leading perspective that cat is gigantic.  I know Maine Coons are huge, I've had a few, but that thing is a beast.  I'm so jealous.
Lo‚Äô bob
There's a 100% chance Bob has Magic Missile prepped.

That is not a cat. I don‚Äôt know what it is, but it‚Äôs probably endangered. Lol
Bob asked if he could come visit me, and stay for the weekend.  Maybe the winter.   

You know what, just drop him off and we can discuss pickup time at a later date. 

Thanks!

Wide angle lens making him seem bigger than he is.

Look at the size of the vets hands compared to her head.
That‚Äôs a dog with a cat appearance.
He's clearly angry, and he's coming to beat us up.  But I still love him...
I need a banana for scale
That cat, Bob is a bobcat!
This is clearly one of those illusion things..  

Average size cat, she's just holding it *sort of out* in front of her to give the illusion of hugeness!
Very big cat, or very small woman?
So anyone who has a cat that big, I have to ask....are their shits just as huge? I had a pretty small cat and already she was a poop machine. I cant imagine trying to have a litter box with big cats like that. Or how much you would spend on food!
Nimitz from the Honor Harrington book series minus two limbs??
what does BIGCATBOB eat for dinner?  whatever he wants.
How is this a house cat
Haha. The clinic O work at has the same red clippers with tape in the same spots.
Oh it's you, Bob.
NOW that's what I call a mountain cat! My half maine coon half tabby cat I thought she was big, this one rivals her!
That lady can barely carry him and that cat is not liking his current activity.
That‚Äôs half cat, half wolf.
The eyes on that day are huge
I love him
Not sure if tiny human or giant cat...
I'd be scared to have a cat that large, imagine if it got angry... he could eat you.
You mean, Bob cat?
Is your mom 3 feet tall?

I love giant cats, they're so rare. When I was a kid there was this stray/neighborhood siamese Tom cat that was the size of a dog. Best cat ever. He was just so fucking cool. I haven't seen a cat as big as him since, almost thought I imagined it. Until now.
I think you mean bobcat!
This is what I imagine Harry Dresden's cat Mister looks like.
Is....is the cat somewhere behind the small pony that woman is holding?
That's no house cat, that's a freaking Lynx hahaha

He looks like a Bobcat!

That cat looks like he wants to eat whomever is taking that pic. I‚Äôve never seen a cat that big that wasn‚Äôt on National Geographic but he/she is gorgeous and I‚Äôm a dog person.
Maine Coons are just the most beautiful creatures‚ù§Ô∏è
*CKONK*
it is a bobcat.
More like your mom's bobcat
The cat has the Liam Neeson look from Taken and is about to say that famous quote
I adopted a Main Coon without knowing its breed, now I have  a very sweet 25lbs UNIT
I love look of disappointment and disdain on Bob‚Äôs face, like ‚Äúyou get your picture yet lady? Need another take? Just put me down already‚Äù
I‚Äôm 100% a dog person but I‚Äôd enjoy a cat like Bob.
Who is this lady you have shrunk gypsy?
Pretty apt name, considering I almost thought he was a bobcat
Oh my gosh! THAT'S HUGE!!! It looks like a bobcat or a lynx.
BBB. Big Boi Bob.
Rhe name tho the oldest meme
Wow, that woman is really small.

Oh my god I love him!! So large! He looks like a wise old owl
Vet tech is also 7 feet tall. Bob is a big, floofy boi.

"this human better put me down, or there's gonna be trouble"

I think I'd love to have a mane coon putty tat.  :)
Is this a lynxx or bob cat
That's amazing
Every time I see a coon like this I sadly remember they cost a fortune...
lift with your legs, not your back!
I'm choking on imaginary furballs just looking at him, but he is beautiful.
Put me down, Lisa. 

....~ cat
That‚Äôs a big Bob cat.
I love bob.
Is he...a Bob cat?
Are you 4ft tall?
How can they manage to have such huuge cats? My normal sized cat is beautiful and lovely but he sometimes gets mad and 'bites' and one time I had an incident of Agression Redirection when fending off another cat outside the window, he bit and scratched my leg to the point I bled and had to take antibiotics. Beautiful though!
I want that cat
your mom looks really young! how old are you??
Handsome chonker

I‚Äôm getting very strong Khajit vibes. The moon must have made this one a house cat.
r/absoluteunits
Is that not a Bobcat or something wild? Mixed at least?
Himb looks like a mountain lion
The nurse looks so happy, Bob does not
I have a cousin who breeds those dog sized kitties.
I love him
That is not a happy cat face. Beautiful cat, though‚Ä¶
Your mom has a nice face
Kinda surprised I haven‚Äôt seen any Bobcat puns
What a cutie <3
This boy needs an Instagram.
He is gorgeous. Where is he from?
What breed is this?
That's a straight up lynx
Looks like he could pull down a deer if he got hungry.
... Bobcat
ooo a little land mammal.
Is Bob short for Bob cat?!

Am I the only one that thinks that looks like ozymandyazis cat from watchmen
I think you meant big bob cat üòÇ

Your cat has a weird t-shirt
Cat Bob or bobcat?
Is that cat, Bob, or is it a bobcat?
Bob is my idea of the perfect cat. Please give him snuggles from me.
I love when pets are named Bob. The name is just so good for every pet out there xD
I would pay to cuddle with that kitty.
What is his personality like?
Is that an owl? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Out of all the amazing names like CATHULU. You choose BOB
Big is an understatement.
i feel like cats are just gonna rule over the world
This cat could seriously fuck you up
HI BOB!

Big cat bob, or bib bob cat?!
An absolute unit
Pretty sure you have some kind of fancy wild predator there.
r/absoluteunits
Does Bob like headpats, /u/ptrk83? If so, please give him one from me üòç
Why are cats getting larger and dogs getting smaller??
He weighs more than my 3 cats put together üê±
That's insane
My five month old kitten looks just nearly full grown already. But my other kitten ( same age) looks like she was born only 8 weeks ago.
Are you sure it‚Äôs not reversed like ‚Äúmy bobcat‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmy cat bob‚Äù
Did the lion eat your cat

My mom‚Äôs big Bobcat.

FTFY
Mister. Bob is the demon in the skull.
OP how old are you -5?
Say hi to your mom for me will ya?
Haha, that's a cute joke. You're not fooling us, though! Any one can see that you've just dressed a full-grown, 6 foot tall and 250 lb adult in a hyper-realistic cat costume!     
    
In all seriousness, though, have y'all ever considered entering that massive kitty in some kind of "Largest Cat to Ever Exist in the Very History of History" contest? Surely there's money, pride, or bragging rights to be won, no?
Most dogs like to chase cats. This cat likes to chase dogs.
Mom I require M A N G O
