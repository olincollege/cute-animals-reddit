Based on the size of the dogs head, it must be one of those magical Harry Potter traveling bags with a whole doggy room inside. 
That dog is so in love with its person omg look at that face
Dogs are not allowed on the subway unless they are in a carrying bag, I love how creative some people are because of this.
How the heck does he fit in there? 
r/petthedamndog
Good traveler doggo 
‚ÄúI‚Äôm just happy to be here‚Äù
Hehe I‚Äôm a luggage 
I can see his tail wagging by the way that zipper is moving. 
If this was tumblr someone would draw what they think it‚Äôs body looked like- smol and stumpy
Look at me hooman
*thumping intensifies*
Subway suitcase doggo!
So many of these videos on reddit have no sound. WHHHYYYY??!
Who else turned up the volume to try and hear the tail wagging?
r/noisygifs
That ‚ÄúKaren, I cant believe you snuck me on the bus‚Äù look he‚Äôs giving haha
r/gifsyoucanhear
Either the bag is too big, or the retriever is too small...
wOmAn CaRrIeS dEcApItAtEd DoG's HeAd In HeR bAg
The dog looks like it should be huge. 
Look Mom, I is a suitcase.

(Smiles) I is best suitcase.
So we're just ignoring the pocket dimension inside the bag? These dimensions dont add up 
These new dog headed robots are really freaking me out.
what kind of dog is this!
*thump thump  thump thump thump*
Is it just me or does it seem like that dog is in a marry poppins bag
the size of the dog's head does not proportionally fit the size of the bag
*HOW DO I UNMUTE THIS*

I was having a pretty bad day. Thanks for this.
He‚Äôs smiling cause there‚Äôs a monkey in that bag
r/dogsinbags
Sometimes I don't even mind the reposts. I'm just like "Aw, I forgot that existed. Nice."
The lack of petting upsets me 
Strange... I didn't think Mary Poppins took the L Train... 
First retriever head transplant on pug body.
You can see the wheels wagging along with him. 
Is it just me or does this head suggest a much larger body than should fit in that carrier? 
That is so a smile. I think they learned it from looking at us and now they smile back ‚ù§‚ù§üê∂
Holy fuck, that is so absurdly adorable lol. There are few things more pure than the unconditional love of a dog with his/her human.

Also, just a random question for anyone that knows more than I do, but:

how can I send this video to a friend without linking the Reddit URL/page? Just want to open the video on it's own without coming to the discussion thread. Anybody know how to do so, via extension or third party website? thanks either way! I want to send this to my wife, but just the vid heh.
If you can‚Äôt, I will help you!!
*thmp thmp thmp thmp*
Feel bad for him stuffed in that suitcase thing!!üò©
It's bigger on the inside! r/doctorwho

Just packed the essentials
Golden retrievers have the best smiles.
You can even see the wheel wobble
"Bruh... your luggage is grinning at me."

I can feel his warm dog panting breath on my hand as I reach to pet him

i feel like its just like a small chiwawa sized dog with a reterivers head and i just love that thought so much

As someone who doesn't live in a super dense city, can someone explain to me why the fuck a fully grown dog is inside of a suitcase?
"dude, look at me, I'm a suitcase"
r/petthedamndog 
How much is that doggy in the suitcase, the one with the waggily tail? 
No one will ever look at me that way.
I like to think the dog heard their human say a joke referring to a doggie bag.

They've heard it a million times but still laughs at it to make their human feel good.
such a good boi! love that smile!
Thats the smile of when i accidentally shit my panties.
We're getting closer to real world pokeballs!
he could be hungry or thirsty
That dog is totally peeing lmao.

I've seen the same look on my dogs face when she was sitting on my bed. 
Cute!!!
I can hear my heart melting <3

he want to hear "good dog!"
Is it comfortable?? 
When you're friends go on vacation and you are broke.
I love the guy who points like ‚Äúwell gosh dang, Carol, there‚Äôs a gosh dang dog in your bag!‚Äù
You're hallucinating.
wow this is great

Thanks that just made my morning commute much brighter! I hope he live somewhere in NYC 
u/vreddit_bot
HES SO FUCKING HAPPY AAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAAHHHHHHHHHH
Need to get him in a clear bag next time...
This made my day, thank you!
Dogs and humans really bring out the absolute best in each other. As the bumper sticker says, "someday I hope to be the person my dog thinks I am."

If creatures so good and pure love us like this, there really must be something redeeming about us after all. 
Okay den
This vid oozes so much love omg
lul
Happy boi ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
This is a great way to start my morning :) 
Omg how is that comfortable lol
Is that not a robo-dog head?
"Look, look, human, look at me.....I'm luggage"
Sneak 100 
I‚Äôd wager he has some variety of walking clock in that box 
"hah hah haa we goofed them we did!"

<3 <3 <3 
Most people sneak in beer but this works too
LOL ... this is so cool !!! 
Lol that dog looks like he just peed over all this ladys clothes

ü•∫
This made my day 
The cutest thing to me is that because it‚Äôs tail is wagging you can see the suit case wheel jiggle back and forth. 
That dog can‚Äôt be comfortable. Also that dog‚Äôs panting, indicating it‚Äôs stressed. 
Am I the only one that thinks a fully grown dog, quite obviously not a puppy, not a miniature breed in a suitcase is cruel?
WELL MAYBE IF WE STARTED POSTING VIDEOS INSTEAD OF GIFS WE COULD HEAR THE TAIL WAGGING
I can‚Äôt hear his tail wagging:( 
Pupper knows the greatest adventures await!
"Kevin for god's sake, it has been 3 hours already goddamit. Please my dude."
This is the same look my Dog gives me when it wants to go outside but doesn‚Äôt want to break the command of lying down on his bed. Trust me, that‚Äôs the look of can I come out now not ‚ÄúOMG that dog is staring at their owner because they are so happy and content.‚Äù It is waiting for the command to get out and hoping the owner says it soon so it can stop being cramped in a bag. 

Edit: look at how concerned the dog is with it‚Äôs shifting eye moving reading the owner. Dogs don‚Äôt smile, but they do pant for many reasons. Mostly because they‚Äôre hot but they also pant when their uncomfortable or nervous. Ever see a dog that doesn‚Äôt like thunder? They aren‚Äôt panting cause they‚Äôre happy.
How is that cute? The dog must be so uncomfortable stuffed into that thing. 
Is it just me, or does this look like an r/incorgnito situation?
Is that Scooby? 
What a good pup. So happy. 
That's a weird looking case. Is it specially made for pets?
I can imagine him peeing much more efficiently 
thwack, thwack, thwack.
When you're being bad but can't keep a straight face while staring at your best friend cause you know you're being bad and you could get in trouble but you're having so much fun you don't care. 
Such a good baby. 
Despite everything, you‚Äôre still happy!
Dogs just want to belong. We have a lot to learn from our 4-legged friends.

When dogs take over, will we be remembered as (fickle yet all-powerful) gods?
It looks like R2Dog2. Huge oversight by George Lucas of what people really want to see.
Ninetails inside Naruto be like...
To stinking cute!
Now look at that smile üòÄ
Awwwww how cute!
If they let fido out of that case,he would be gone.Screw the humans!
We don't deserve dogs!
You can see one of the zipper strings start to flutter when the good boy starts wagging his tail lol
Adorable! :)))
Why won‚Äôt they pet him?!
Let me freeee <3
Hey, hey, look at me. I‚Äôm luggage!
When a dog "smiles" is it actual smiling like we smile?
The zip doesn't move till he does ?? I swear it's a zip?
r/petthedogordie
Best luggage ever.
My dog is too big, I can't find anything to actually carry her in the subway. She's like 70 lbs and the carriers all top out at 40ish
I can feel his hot breath on my face.
smile
That dogs head doesn‚Äôt look proportional to the room left in the suitcase. 
r/subwaycreatures
Let me the fuck out

He is just beaming with positivity, love, and sunshine
I wish I could hear his tail wagging üò≠
For whatever reason, today I can‚Äôt stop missing my childhood Golden I had named Simba.  
This really just drove it home.  
They are such loving and incredible dogs. 
Well I can hear it wagging in the air tonight
Look at that fucking little face. Happy to see this little doggo on our subway system. :) NYC!
r/noisygifs ..... because of OP's title
I can FEEL his tail wagging :)
such a good boy 
You are not fucking kidding me
As cute as it is, that‚Äôs kind of fucked up
I love how honest dogs are. 
Chris Farley's voice: *Big dog in a little box*
The dog is in the bag.
HIHIHIHI its looking like my Friend @Monu 
How does it fit in the suitcase?  Its such a cute dog & all smiley!  I'd be petting it & not watching the game :)
[removed]
That is completely adorable.  That dog looks like hes just absolutely loving that situation lol.
It almost hurts how much i love his happy face
Not to be dramatic but I would die for said doggo
How can you not be petting that dog?
r/noisygifs
What kind of contraption is that dog in? Looks like a suitcase.
I‚Äôm not a dog person but I love these types of dogs

Always so loving 
Yeah but how big is that bag? That dogs face looks like my dogs and shes a full 60 lbs and still a pup who is growing like a weed
I honestly thought I was tripping for a moment 
Awww so dorable 
Wish we could too! Cutie.
Nice
PET HIM!
"They don't even see us :)"
Hahaha üòç 
Why is he in a suitcase? Is it now allowed to bring pet in the subway? 
Nope its mine
u/puppyhearts
I can smell him pooping 
I can hear the sound of pee, hitting a piece of luggage.
Look at me, I‚Äôm luggage 
I‚Äôm just happy to be here, guys! 
I want this dog unboxing video.
He's happy because he's with his best friend, on a ride, pretending to be a snail
How does he fit in there? Good boi
r/petthedamndog
Is that bag like a portal or something? How does a dog with that size of head fit?
He looks to big to fit in whatever he is in. It‚Äôs like an optical illusion. 
Why can't stuff like this happen on my subway 
Packing the essentials 
I really want a dog but I can't. I'm allergic to animal hairs and don't have much time to care of it. 
Feckin cute
Goodest boi
that smile üòç
That's the face of pure happy right there.
When traveling, always pack the things you need the most.
omg I would cry 
If you look closely, the bag‚Äôs zipper in the back moves around the time you think the dogs tail would be wagging
Plot twist: the subway isnt moving, it‚Äôs the tail wagging!
Made sure to pack the essentials
Ffftok fftok tok fftok fftok fftok
*thud thud thud*
I don‚Äôt get it... is this even okay. Is the dog like stuffed in a guitar case? 
Vepwz
AWEE HOLY SHIT CUTNESS OVERLOADDDDD
Awww I cant wait to get home and hug my puppers!
lol that policy is ridiculous.. but seeing how cute pets are in bags/suitcase i think its a good thing.. lol
Rarepuppers?
Cuteness overload! 
Dogs are my favorite part about life ‚ù§Ô∏è

Or he's like "Ouch, my back is killing me. Maybe if I shift a little bit.." 
That bag looks kind of small, so I‚Äôm imagining that dog‚Äôs head but with a tiny chihuahua body
**OMG\~\~\~\~\~\~\~**
Soo cute
must be cramped in there
Wow I got new idea to carry My dog. 
You can see his/her tail wagging by the shaking of the black bag right above that atrocious flower bag.

I love this dog
Awwee
Sure he didn‚Äôt just relieve himself?
Lol
/u/stabbot
Ah yes, the happy sound of tail thump.  It's  a wonderful thing.

The head would indicate a dog bigger than that bag.

Dog dimension...?
he/she is so adorable!!!!!
r/dogsmirin
I'm stoned as hell and though that dog was shoved inside a round suitcase
That‚Äôs the satisfied face of a large poo. 
Cute
I want to know how big this dog is! 
Goodest of boys
There is no sound so how could u hear him
Urgh, don't smile... you're already cute enough XD it's unbearable 
We can't..
It‚Äôs Scooby Doo!
Where can I buy a suitcase full of happiness like that?
Those happy teefs!
Aww look at his face
this is animal cruelty, would you do this to a person? PETA
ok good

Loool Hilarious.
Feel like I've seen this before. With Reddit I can no longer tell
Is that a full grown Golden put into a guitar case? Pardon my silliness; my vision is poor.

Hahha a dog. In bag.  
But I can‚Äôt
Theoretically or literally?

I imagine that face can only be mated with a tail that is wagging like mad.

I'm not in a big city with a train, but I think I just found the next trick I'm training my next dog!
The Zipper on the bottom left of the bag starts vibrating as soon as *D O G B O I* starts smiling.

Visually and mentally you def know and hear the tail wag. üêï 
Aww! /u/itsallabigshow, you need to see this one!

So ducking precious oh my god look at THAT SMILEEEEEEEE

i sit in the case.

i make happy face.
Such lovely doggo 

If you know anything about Golden Retrievers, you would know they are people pleasers. They will endure a lot of pain to make their masters happy. This is not a cute video of a large dog enjoying itself in a tiny suitcase. This is not an "aww" picture. It is ANIMAL CRUELTY! What is wrong with you people? 
THIS IS HURTING THE DOG
oh hey wait he is smiling
Mirir‚Äôn hard that dogo is
I see very different things here: it is probably warm and the dog seems nervous. This is not an relaxed dog at all
Can I upvote twice?
No u can‚Äôt, there‚Äôs no sound
You can see the exact moment the Holman says, ‚ÄúGood boy.‚Äù
He's so happy! His head sticking out of the case like,
