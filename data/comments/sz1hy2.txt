I love how arnie just casually posts in r/aww
I always think ‚Äúmaybe I should spend less time on Reddit‚Äù And then I stumble across Arnold Schwarzenegger posting a picture of his cute dog lol.  This is wonderful.
I introduced her to my newsletter subscribers and my own reddit and I almost forgot about you guys. She‚Äôs the sweetest meatball. I got her for Christmas. She and Dutch are best friends. Lulu tried to trample her so we are working on their relationship.
Puppernator
Every moment on reddit I think I've seen it all... and then suddenly Arnold Schwarzenegger shows up with a cute picture of him and his dog.

Thank you internet, and thank you Arnold you're amazing.
Omg it‚Äôs a leonberger! Amazing loving dogs! Very owner focused, but also very caring and sweet. Loved our amazing baby, enjoy every moment of this amazing dog

We called ours our masked bandit.
Ah Arnold Schwarzenegger didnt expect that. Take care Arnold if you see this
Hi, Schnitzel!!
What a big baby!
/u/GovSchwarzenegger , is she a Leonberger? 

Funny enough, my dog is actually named after you, his name is Arnie! 

[Here's a picture of him](https://imgur.com/a/B61WXnY)
I take comfort in the fact that the Governator is subscribed to r/aww.

This‚Äôll be front page in no time
Radda radda
My reaction to the photo, in stages:

1) "Daww, look at that puppers! Big cute puppers!"

2) "Wow, that guy kind of looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger..."

3) "Wow, he REALLY looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger."

4) *looks at account name* "oh. Yeah, that explains it."

5) "Daww, he's got a cute puppy."
Schnitzel looks like a good girl!
That dog is going to be so big the owner is going to have to at least be a body builder, terminator, Hercules, barbarian,  with a twin to be able to lift it when it gets to be full size.
![gif](giphy|XBvadRPq1wsllQJWZG|downsized)
That‚Äôs an adorable pup!
Can we just address that dogs are so great it took a considerable amount of time for me to even notice Arnold freaking Schwarzenegger in this picture
Going to be a big pup.
*I‚Äôll be bark!*
Hey Schnitzel! And what is the name of the dog?
What in the world is Arnold doing on here this is awesome
Girl, gun, cigar.
My dog passed away yesterday, this was a pleasant pick me up! Thank you Mr. Arnold
Guten Abend Schnitzel!
This is exactly how my golden doodles like to be held. I‚Äôm sure Schnitzel has a heck of a personality!
whenever you leave the house do you ever say "I'll be back" to her
Ich bin ein Schnitzel
Rada rada? Rada, rada rada rada!
That is one lucky human
Say hello to my furry friend!
Schnitzel is absolutely adorable
Good luck with the potty training.  :)
Schnitzel is actually my curse word. I stub my toe? Schintzel! My car won't start? Schnitzel!
And what‚Äôs the dog called?
Omg it's the real Arnold!! To randomly scroll and find this post, this early, yeez I need to buy myself a lottery. Keep it real, Terminatorüëä!
is her full name arnold schnitzelnegger
Absolutely adorable!

It's awesome to see the biggest action star in my lifetime being so wholesome and generous. Thanks for all the great work over the years, both on and off screen. You're the coolest.
I feel like this brings a new meaning to ‚Äúsay hello to my little friend!‚Äù
That looks like a leonburger! We used to have one and she was the sweetest dog ever. Hope Schnitzel brings you many years of joy!
What a beautiful dog
She looks adorable Arnold, what breed is she?
It's the SchwarzenSchnitzel!
How long is that dog?!
Please, _please_ tell Schnitzel that I love her. What a sweet face!!
Ok. Hi Baby Gorgeous, Schnitzel!
Ya, but what‚Äôs the dog‚Äôs name?
Every time he leaves the house:
"I'll be back üòé".


Or if the dog was rescued and adopted:
"Come with me if you want to live."
Finding out that one of my childhood hero‚Äôs is a dog lover.  Best thing to happen in 2 years.

IT'S A BABY LEONBERGER, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! My favorite dog breed!

.... Is thar Arnold Schwarzenegger?
But no wiener!
Quite a workout regimen you have her on Gov...one large dogo in the making.
This is why I love reddit sometimes.
Cheers Arnie you were the bomb in conan yo!
Hi Schnitzel! (Typical grandparents‚Äô house scene in the background)
What?? Arnie is that really you??
Cute! Looks like a puppy. Did you shop, or adopt?
Awww!! Please give schnitzel lots of belly rubs ‚ô°
Weird seeing a dog making Arnold look small
Big floof!
/u/GovSchwarzenegger Do you have any special recipes for Wiener Schnitzel? I miss the Austrian Heurigers.
This guy kind of looks like the terminator guy
Schnitzel!!!
wholesome
We love Schnitzel!
Schnitzel the favourite treat. For all the boys and girls to eat. Schnitzel mam can serve them quick. It's a schnitzel On a stick
Hello schnitzel
And a BOOP to both of you!
Certainly didn‚Äôt expect to see this is my feed. Hello schnitzel! Love your doggy
Hi Schnitzel
What a cutie
That is a big pupper, a prime grade a large doggo full of love.
I was gonna say you look like Arnold then I realized lmao
Thanks for pic, Mr S. Feeling kinda down today so this helps.
Very wholesome, very much needed
What an absolute legend.
Given geopolitics, I needed this.
Schnitzel Schwarzenegger? Wonder what it's middle name is?
Rada rada!
Say hello to my Schnitzel friend
Lookin good Arnie!!!! Dog looks like a lotta fun too!!
Beautiful hello
This is so cute
Well this is going to blow the fuck up.
What kind of dog is she? She‚Äôs just beautiful! You are wonderful Arnold!
![gif](giphy|VgegfLZL4Gc1I0NK2A)
How beautiful! I've always wanted a dog, I imagine it would greatly improve my mental health.
I am happy for the both of you. I miss being around dogs!
You're a real, true inspiration!  Stay fit and stay healthy!  YOU RULE!
I don‚Äôt know which is better, the puppy or all the cool stuff on his shelf
Anyone else take too long to notice who was holding the dog because they're to busy looking at the beautiful floof?
#Radda radda
"come with me if you want to cuddle!"
Statue in the back: **It's MY turn to hold the dog**
Hi, Schnitzel !
You have a lovely dog.
Hello Schnitzel!
It took me a moment to realize why this was the top post on reddit right now. I was just looking at the dog. It's very cute, yes, but then it was like oh! That's Arnold's dog!
Hey Schitzel, who is your Daddy and what does he do?
Omg Arnold
I zoomed in for a Wiener, Schnitzel, and then realised it‚Äôs a She!
I‚Äôm such a lifelong fan of the Governator, and these posts on Reddit really make me happy.
Is that Marcus Brody in the background? Hmmm‚Ä¶ I thought he would blend in. Disappear..
rada rada
it's arnoldddddd
Is that the governator?!
Schnitzel has no weiner, nice looking puppy
Hello Schnitzel. That's one BIG schnitzel.
Schnitzel never skips leg day!
Awww- and who is the dog?
Hi Schnitzel
awesome dog
I'm trying to find my old VHS tape of Conan The Barbarian! It should go in a museum honestly lol
LOOK AT THE LITTLE FLUFFY CHICKEN NUGGET
I didn't see your username, and I thought "Wow, this guy looks a lot like Arnold Schwarzenegger."
TIL Big Arnie is a redditor lmao
this dog hears "i'll be back" more than anything on earth
Love this man. I was in the Air Force for 23 years and was stationed at Edwards AFB from 2000-2002. My job was test development on the F-22 Raptor at the CTF.

Arnold and his son came to see the newest fighter on the block. I was excited to meet him. I even had my vinyl hand painted T2 Arnold model for him to sign.

For some reason he was moved to a different location at Edwards,  unfortunately I didn't get to meet him.

To the best actor who rocks SciFi movies! Maybe some day I can meet him!
I didn't read who the OP was when I first saw the picture, I look at the owner and I think to myself "This dude looks like a badass, he seems really familiar!" It turns out to be gov Schwarzenegger himself! Always glad to see a famous person with an adorable animal
I have a dog named Arnold! He was the most muscular and way bigger than all the other pups. I speak to him with my Arnold impression, which is spot on people tell me.
She‚Äôs a mighty pupper, but so cute ü•∞
Thats a cute pup right there!
She's adorable!
Hello, Schnitzel!
Schwarzenoodledoodledo?  :)
I like schnitzel.
Oh.. my.. gods.. Ohmygods‚Ä¶ OHMYGODS! **OHMYGODS!!!**

#SHE‚ÄôS ADORABLE!!!
Governor, I have no idea whether you will see this. But I have owned big dogs my entire life. St. Bernards, Newfoundlands, Bernese Mountain Dogs, etc. All of my dogs have been my babies, but my Leonberger is like no other dog I have ever owned. I don't know whether you have ever had one before, but, if not, you should know: they're the sweetest, most relaxed, most wonderfully bright and loving and special dogs imaginable. I hope you have her for a very long time, and I know that you will love and cherish every minute with her for the rest of your life. Congratulations. <3
I got a new dog named Betty on Sunday from my local humane society. She‚Äôs part Rottweiler and part shepherd
Holy shit it‚Äôs actually arnold
Is that a statue of Winston Churchill grabbing his own nipples? Not judging, just curious...
What an interesting collection on the shelves‚Ä¶then there‚Äôs the dog bowl‚Ä¶just the normal dog loving home
Oh man. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Grew up watching all his films. Copying his lines. Hitting the gym with him as my motivation.  I'm my own man no doubt but he's such a great example in so many ways. 

 It's an amazing time to be alive when he casually drops a photo like this and there's even a chance he'll read and respond to someone's thoughts / comments. 

The internet can be wonderful. Thanks for the share and all the good times  /u/GovSchwarzenegger
Which one is more loveable? I can't tell
I told my brother to call his dog Schhitzel a long time ago, did he, no. Arnie gets it.
"I'll be back" dun X2 dun X1 dun X2
Was ist ein Leben ohne Schnitzel?
So adorable! That's a big pup though - give them loves to compensate!
Not a post I knew I wanted, but definitely one I needed.
Wouldn't a Weener dog be a better schnitzel? Cause of Wiener schnitzel?
This is why he is still the man
youre the man mr schwarzenegger!
Jaeger?
And where is strudel?
Today is the day I found out that Arnold is a mod on this sub
Hello Schnitzel
Hi puppy!!
Why am i not surprised his name is Schnitzel...
Hell, i even kind of expected it.
That's one cute dog
‚ÄúNo, screw your [Schnitzel]‚Äù- Arnold
Leonberger(sp?)
AWW HE IS SO CUTE
Arnie tryin‚Äô to break Reddit.
Hey Arnold, I just want you to know that ‚ÄòJingle All the Way‚Äô is an amazing movie and not played nearly enough on tv. One of my childhood favorites.
I love that my favorite actor just randomly posts here
You are an awesome human being, sir and one of my heroes. Schnitzel is a cutie.
To the best and toughest actor ever, please send 1 copy of this dog to me. Ty
Arnold is like a rare wine, gets better with age. Would love to see him do a king conan movie at his current age
Great doggo, great father, just great

![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes) I laughed to see "Schnitzel" doesn't have a weiner!! Adorable! (Her and the name!)
[removed]
Das ist der erst beste Schnitzel Hund! So niedlich!

Questions about your bookshelf:Who is the statue of? I don't recognize the bow-tie figure.The Last Lion books on Churchill. Do you recommend them?

And I want to add that I am thrilled that you've gone whole food plant-based. I saw it in Netflix's Game Changers. I think you and other athletes will lead the way to show younger athletes toward better diets and better results. I made the switch too and I don't miss its: no meat, no fish, no dairy. I've even switched from beer to non-alcoholic beer. Same flavor, but no glorious beer stein.
I doubt anyone will see this, but I‚Äôm having a lot of trouble finding myself in this world. I‚Äôve been trying do what I think I want to do for so long but nothing works. I know that there are different ways to live my life but I feel like it would just be too depressing to go on that way. More than anything I think this is just a way to vent. If you‚Äôre reading this, thanks, and sorry if I annoyed you.
Arnold, me and you share a birthday and you never say happy birthday back. Also, WWWWHHHOOOOSSSS SOOOO FLUFFY!
I miss young Arnold. Old Arnold is a disaappintment.
Adopt, don't shop....adorable though
Is Schnitzel an Austrian Shepherd?
She has some big old paws. Cute baby.
Not sure if this is the dogs name, or foreshadowing.
Also Arnold ‚Äúfuck your freedom!‚Äù
B E S T B O I

Sorry to be so doubtful but how would it be if the OP is actually Arnold; that would be incredible \^_^

Farming karma, but I'll allow it.
Oh shoot love you man and the little one

Sweet dogo

Aw what a beautiful dog. Big dogs are simply the best.
Reddit posters have been so bad at naming their own pets lately. I love this perfectly named pup. Welcome to the world, Schnitzel! 

So floofy! ü•∞
Ach wie ich Hunde liebe üëçüèª
They're both so furry and huggable!
Oh my, that puppy is like a little teddy bear! ;)
Mit Zitrone und Erd√§pfelsalat?

She's so fluffy! I would give anything to give her a big cuddle!
Damn, I'm early!

Did a literal double take seeing this on my feed haha
I started to get mad someone was pretending to be Arnold but the name checks out

Hi Schnitzel
Hello Schnitzel! Congrats on the new member of the family Arnold. What kind of dog is she?
Didn't think I'd be part of Reddit history when I woke up this morning

Schnitzel is perfect.
Adorable! And a good snuggler, apparently. :)
Fricken adorable

She looks very comfy haha
My life is complete, now. Schnitzel is so cute!
Lovely boy :) hi Schnitzel
hello schnitzel should be a dachshund with that name!
You need one named J√§ger now so you can have Jager Schnitzel!
Why would you name a watch Schnitzel?
Is this another karma bot
One of his nicknames better be "Schni-Schni"
Lapdogs are the best!
Hi sweetie!!
She's huge! Look at those pig ol paws. Better cradle her while you can, you won't be able to for long! What a beautiful dog, I love her name!!
Schnitzel looks so COZY
Hallo, Schnitzel and u/GovSchwarzenegger!  Looking good!
Hello!

Hello Schnitzel, take god care of this gem of a man
Aww
Hello üëã from Fremantle WA , he‚Äôs a big floofer
Well, isn't she just a big ball of cuteness!
Anybody else more interested in on what‚Äôs on the shelves behind him?
Hello Schnitzel!
Hey Arnold
Schnitzel ist zum Anbei√üen!
So much fluff!
Ausgezeichnet!  Sehr sch√∂nes M√§dchen.
Hi Schnitzel! ü•∞
Why is that statue in the background judging me?
Governor Arnold for the win! Bringing us happiness when we need it the most ‚≠êÔ∏è
I adore this man. And Schnitzel
Arnold and his puppy are 70 years apart and both still better looking and more fit than me!
Hallo Schnitzel ‚ù§Ô∏è
He is a cutie! What breed?
Hi Schnitzel!
Aw what a cutie pie
She‚Äôs considerably larger than a schnitzel. 

Also, we demand growth update photos!
Awww, adorable!
Oh my gosh hi Schnitzel! And Arnold!
Arnold has a pet dwarf donkey that lives in his house, it‚Äôs so cute
We just got a new doggy too! A retired racing greyhound. The long nose and big eyes make it look like she‚Äôs always looking up at you. Her name is Vika and I love her dearly already
Awww‚Ä¶I had a ruff‚Ä¶I mean rough day (ugly crying) and this cheered me right up.
That puppy is gonna be a giant!
Hello Schnitzel I love you! 

What breed is she? She looks just like my German Shepherd/Great Pyrenees boy, Gambit.
Scritches for Schnitzel! She‚Äôs gorgeous!
So cute ü•∞
So fluffy I‚Äôm gonna die! ü•∞
I love her.
Are you chicken? But, you are adorable üíô
SCHNITZEL MY DUDE tell your dad I say hi.

It would literally make my whole year of you responded to my comment please, OP. 

Also your dog is so goddamn cute!
The pink belly spots are adorable
Awww,  good pup Schnitzel
Look at that dog. 

That's a nice dog.
She's so beautiful!
What's Schnitzel's favorite snack?
Hellooooo Schnitzel!! - from Fort Collins CO
A ‚ù§Ô∏è-liches "Servus Schnitzel!" aus Soizburg! üëã
What a cute little pup! Haha.
That's a big ass puppy
Now that is a PUPPY!
You should be careful about putting your face on Reddit. Someone may doxx you and figure out who you are.
I like to imagine Arnold is so filled with joy and love that he was like ‚Äúhow can I share all these emotions with everyone!‚Äù And someone was like ‚Äúpost it on /r/awww sir!‚Äù

And he was like, ‚Äú yeah I know right, awwww!!‚Äù
I love you shnitzel! I love you arny!
Very beautiful Pup!! You are a good man ArnoldüíôüêæüêæI love that you have so many animals!
He‚Äôs like a giant teddy bear!
What a doll!
Hello!

Really a big dog for a strong man like Arnold!
Hi Schnitzel!!!!!
Hallo Schnitzel
So handsome!!  (The dog‚Äôs cute too)
Damn now I wanna pet Schnitzel
He a good boi
That‚Äôs a nice looking puppy!!  
Take care!!

Love from Canada!!
Hey Mr. Schwarzenegger, I noticed you had a couple Churchill books on your shelf, would you care to tell us what some of your favorite books are to read?
hello schnitzel
Awww, Arnie got himself a doggo, now I bet you when ever he takes it for a walk he turns to his wife and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back.‚Äù
Is that a bust behind you of Bill Murray grabbing his bust?
Hello Schnitzel!
Never did I think I'd see Arnold Schwarzenegger on reddit posting pictures of his dog. Guess I'll have to cross that off. Hope all is well, Arnold, and Schnitzel is a cute dog indeed.
Hey you kinda look like the guy from kindergarten cop
Send help I've been caught by the terminator
Willkommen Schnitzel!!
Great pic!
Arnold, you are a legend. What breed is the dog? It looks like she can be a leonberger.
Hola Schnitzel!
What an adorable fuzzball--and such beautiful coloration! 'Twill be a very handsome dog; congratulations on your adoption of lovely Schnitzel! üê∂ü¶Æüíö
his first name should be Mr. Weiner
Schnitzel is cute ;)

I want him to have constant belly rubs and head pats ;)
She is so foofy!!! She looks at least part Chow Chow, and completely adorable :).
The bestest boy!  And the dog's good too. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|wink)
Oh man... it's the big man himself.

And there's a human with him there, too.
Yeahhhh this definitely gona do numbers
Doubt you‚Äôll see this sir, but if you do, can you just‚Ä¶ tell me it‚Äôs all gonna work out? I‚Äôm going through a hard time right now.
The dog is cute, but get Arnold out of the picture. Nobody likes him.
this is the best!  Beautiful pup!
Hi Schnitzel!

i guess he still has some growing to do?
Radda Radda ü•∫ü•∫
OMG! What a sweet baby! I must say, I genuinely look forward to your post. Thank you for making my day!
Leonberger, have a 5 year old girl, and a 3 year old brown boy neufie.
She's gonna be a big girl!
Leonberger?
She looks both like a puppy and a full-grown dog.  What a cutie!!
Schnitzel, my nizzle, it's the Schwarzenegger's d-o-double-nizzle
Hello Schnitzel!! You are going to be a fluffy TANK with those paws!
Look at all the cool shit just on the shelves. I feel like Arnold‚Äôs house is a museum of Arnold that I would buy a ticket to go see.
So cute!!
Hello, people viewing this in the future! To the front page of Reddit Arnold and Schnitzel go
Thanks for posting, but I will keep calling him Arnold.
Not only did he give us a cute post but he gave us plenty of stuff to zoom in and look at
Hey, I just saw that video of some kid jump kicking you and you barely budged haha
Ok but that terminator skull in the background is sick as fuck üëÄ
Thank god you have all those photos behind you, I wouldn't have recognised you! Congrats on the pup, your speaking never ceases to inspire me, even when I don't want it to. Here's to Austria's best two exports- you and that pup!
Glad he didn‚Äôt name her ‚Äúthe maid‚Äù
Rada Rada
That‚Äôs bad ass skull behind you too. What‚Äôs the story behind that?
Cute puppy. Enjoy.
For some reason everything on the shelf is what I expect Arnold Schwarzenegger would display but at the same time seems off with no terminator pictures.
Gah! Reddit comes through again! Mutha Effin Terminator and his hella adorable pup!!
Hello Schnitzel! I'm a fan of your dad.
Hugsta La Vista puppr
Now you need an ebike that can accommodate both you and Schnitzel! Maybe a tandem? A picture of that would definitely break the internet.
Look at this dog showing off his Mr. Olympian.
I just had schnitzel for dinner last night lol
Such a biiiiiiig puppy!
What an amazing absurd ambitious display behind you.  You seem to have lived quite the life!  There are about nine items per shelf, four shelves, and not one is a trophy or an award of which you probably have hundreds.  That is fucking badass.
*CIA got you pushing too many Schnitzels!*
She looks so cozy.
I truly believe Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't have any blunder years pictures.
A beautiful addition to the Schnitzenegger family.
I fan-girled way too hard at this. Arnold AND an adorable fluff?! Day has been made.
Please tell Schnitzel that I love her.
Omg it's so adorable! Cute dog too!
Beautiful dog Mr Schwarzenegger
Please tell Schnitzel I love her
She looks a little different from your last maid Arnie.
I love schnitzel and Schnitzel!
THAT ADORABLE FACE I LOVE HER!
What a little CUTIE PIE üòç
Hello Schnitzel....who is your daddy, and what does he do?
Happy Twosday Schnitzel!!! 

My dream is still to play my idol (Schwarzenegger, duh!) in Chess one day üòÜüòÜüòÜ
Man, I hope I look 1/10th as good as you at 74
She's so fluffy and adorable. All the best to you all.
Hello Schnitzel!
Haha a housekeeper chaser holding a beaut!
big dog for the big dog
hello to Schnitzel
"Rada radarada rada rada arf!"

EDIT: ngl, I hear Schnitzel, I think Chowder!
Servus Schnitzel! :D
Where‚Äôs the wiener??
Adorable! The chonk-a-tor.
That is one fluffy pupper
Busts Into door:
I need your snout, your paws, and your belly


Dog: :3
What a wonderful name :)
We named my parents cats Schnitzel and Kn√∂del.
Have fun with your new friend!
Thank you for this
![gif](giphy|C3DJ5zE2l2VUc|downsized)

he cute
What's the story with the skull off your right shoulder?
But it's not a Wiener!
Hello schnitzel what's you're dogs name
:)
Say why you met with Enron's Kenneth Lay and convicted finance criminal Mike Milken on May 17, 2001, before launching your gubernatorial campaign.
Hi Schnitzel! üëã

(Psst blink once of your owner is a good terminator or twice if he's an evil terminator.)
The bestest floof.

Which one I mean, I'll leave up to y'all to guess. ;)
Wilkommen Hund!
Such a good name!
Congratulations on your new family member. I'm sure Lulu will come around. From one dog owner to another, have fun this Spring trying to keep the mud out of that fluff.
Hi Schnitzel and Schnitzels Schnitzel.
OMG.  Hello, Schnitzel!!  You are precious and have the greatest name ever!  Would your daddy mind sharing your breed?
Ahhh! You got the schniziest one! Gorgeous girl, adorable name
Imagine you're in LA, just minding your own business. Suddenly, you hear from behind you:
"SCHNITZEL!! NEIN, SCHNITZEL! FU√ü! SCHNITZEL, FU√ü!"  
You turn around to see an adorable puppy about to tackle you. Behind that puppy? Arnold Schwarzenegger.  
You'd tell your grandkids, and they'd tell their's.
Please give Schnitzel scritches on all of our behalf!
I‚Äôve gotta say I absolutely love seeing you active on Reddit. I grew up watching your movies and still to this day, there are several of them I watch on a regular basis. I know you‚Äôll prob not see this, but if you do, what was your favorite action movie you‚Äôve made, and why?
Schnitzel is perfect!
Thank you for not asking us what to name your dog.
Hey u/GovSchwarzenegger, I have to admit, you have the coolist pets. How is your little donkey?  My wife saw yours now she wants one too!
What a beautiful puppy! Also like the statue behind you. You look cool to
Is the guy in the back OK
If I could look that badass with gray and white in my eyebrows and beard when I'm older, I'll be happy lol. Also, hello Schnitzel
Dog is man's best friend, your dog looks big and cute
Rada rada rada!
GET TO DA CHOPPA!!!!
Hello!
I love puppy energy in small bursts. That pooch looks like it's a handful.
Is the dog also a terminator?
Hi !
Having a ton of German/Swiss/Austrian relatives‚Ä¶ skull & gun picture aside your hutch is taking me right back to being a kid/ relatives way of decorating.
Aww she's so sweet and of course you named her after the great Austrian dish :)
Sound of music commemorative plate lol
She is adorable!!!
The things on your bookshelves are exactly what I would imagine (in a good way)
Hullo, Governor!  I honestly looked at the dog first.
best girl and best actor in one image
Hello Schnitzel.  And hello Arnold.
She is so fluffy and cute ü•∞ü•∞
You can really get a look at his personal life on the shelves
I had a shetland sheepdog from 1997 - 2007 that I named after you! Arnold was a good boy!
Doesn't that mean friend in Dutch?
Yall named your dog Chicken. I love it.
Sweet girl, she‚Äôs so big because she‚Äôs full of love
What a cutie!
hello!

Rescue?  Any idea on the age?  You two are waaay too cute together!

The new reddit UI and specifically viewing media is the worst
Awesome he has a dog named Dutch!

I always envisioned the Governator leading a pack with names like Dillon, Mac, Poncho, Cooper, Billy, and Hawkins.  Doesn‚Äôt even need a leash. Just barks orders.
Hello Schnitzel!
Can we talk about the picture in the background.. Second shelf down on the far right.
Adorable!!!!!! (The dog, not the barbarian!)
Awwww
Hello Schnitzel!  Try to not be the wurst.
Hi Arnold
TALK TO THE PUP
Oh my god I love him
What breed is it? So cute!
Mr. Schwarzenegger thank you for everything that you are, especially in this chapter of your life.
That looks like an absolute unit of a Baby! 
Is this a Leonberger? Schnitzel is massively cute. ‚ô°

Hello floof
Sch√§tzchen
The first thing I said to myself was "ho ho, that's gonna be a floofer..." then I noticed Arnold and went "Schnitzel Schwarzenegger... that's a fine name."
Awwww hello sweety, ur so gorgeous(puppy)
Hello Schnitzel!!!
Long live Arnold! And his beautiful pupper!
The superstar with a heart as big as his muscles. 

Have nothing but respect for the Governator. 

Thanks for sharing your adorable pup with us, Arnold!

I was expecting a big Panerai like the Egi on those wrists!

Awesome dog by the way!
Coming soon. Terminator Dog from the future.
Hello Schnitzel, your dad has an impressive collection of beer steins!
Absolute top tier loveliness
üêïüêïüêïAww hi cute doggoüê∂üê∂üê∂
Schnitzel is a teddy bear
Hello beast!
Awww, hello Schnitzel!!!!
I find it nice looking at your mantle. After a life of living at the top as a movie star and everything that you have achieved, the memories on your mantle are of family.
I'm disappointment there's no bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's on the bookshelf to fuel the conspiracy.
Besides the gorgeous pup, did anyone else peep the fabulous pic of Arnold and Jamie Lee Curtis dancing in the upper right hand corner?
What a beauty
Constant updates on this floof are requested.
‚ù§Ô∏è
A lovely cuddly friend
Hallo!
Heard he's Arnold new chauffeur.
Hello Schnitzel! You are simply adorable. M r. S thank you for your kind heart. .. . Your work with the homeless is heartwarming.
I LOVE HIM!
hello pounded chicken
You, sir, are an inspiration and a national treasure. She‚Äôs a beauty!
I think that dog can take you
Omg Arnold got a bear
It appears that Arnie is the one who has been terminated‚Ä¶ by fluff and snuggles
Dog named schnitzel? Are you german, austrian or swiss?
Snuggle me if you wish to live.
My friend told me /u/GovSchwarzenegger got a dog but I don't believe him

I'm glad to hear ITS NOT A RUMOR!!!!
Hello Schnitzel!
I must know how old schnitzel is! If you got schnitzel at 8 wks, they'd be around 4 months? What a monster doggo.
Love ya üëç
Sehr hubsch!
My 4 Mo. old pup is named Pancake, which goes well with Schnitzel!  I'm in the South Bay if you want a playdate.
My kind of republican
cute puppy for the dub
hello to Schnitzel
We love you Arnie. Thanks for sharing your pup!
Sooo adorable!!
Governator, she looks like a Leonberger, and definitely like a sweet doggy!!! Congrats!
Imagine being Arnies dog and having no idea.
She looks very polite
Awesome! Thanks for sharing Sir!
Hi Schnitzel! How do you feel about German dogs with short little legs lol? ü•∞üíï
Great name!
Krommmm!!!!
what‚Äôs up with the statue in the background ü§®üì∏
Hi
Wait‚Ä¶Is this real? Like that‚Äôs really Mr. Schwarzenegger?
Governator,

I thank you for all your hard work in your life.  I picked up your ‚Äúnew encyclopedia of modern body building‚Äù and my life has changed. I am in the best shape at 33 than any other time.  Thank you for your guidance. May life continue to bless you. 

ML
I am watching T2 and I come upon you and Schnitzel- like major serendipity! Thanks for posting!!!
That Churchhill bust is amazing!
Arnold Schwarzenegger?
What kind of breed is this?
Hi u/GovSchwarzenegger. 

I really wish I could hug your dog. If everyone could hug this dog, world peace might be within reach. 

Please tell her she is a very very good girl.
You look a bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Is she related to the schnitzelnazis by any chance?

Time for me to leave for a bit. And Schnitzel, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back‚Äù.
Can I have that skull back there? That's badass.
SOOOOO CUTE I WANT IT
Love you Arnie. Cute pup
What‚Äôs the deal with that decorative skull?
thank you for blessing us mr governator
I‚Äôm not understanding why he does his head and not his face. Also, NSFW with the dog cooch.
What a floofer
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
Boo fake, not a Weiner!
Leonbergers are amazing dogs Mr. Schwarzenegger, my family has had a some really fantastic ones over the years

That‚Äôs a very cute dog. I also really wish he was wearing that watch instead of the human üòÇ
Radda
Hey Arnold, how is your heart doing? Hope it's all going great
Hello Schnitzel! Such a cutie.
Just wanting to say you have been and continue to be a very positive roll model in my life. Beautiful dog! With a great man!
She's gorgeous! Sounds like a lovely and growing family dynamic. Where'd you get her name from? Also, is that a statue of Denholm Elliott behind you? üòÖ
That definitely is not a wiener schnitzel.
Look at that big and tough looking fellow, so very photogenic he could star in an action movie!!!! I just realized Arnold Schwarzenegger is in the picture to!!!!
hey that's cute pupp.... wait is that Arnie?!!
You have a good human there Schnitzel.
Soooo cute!
It's cool snooping through the Terminator's book case and looking at the photos.
OMG it's so fluffy![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes_rainbow)

Is that a giant puppy?
Thank you for this!!
hello Schnitzel
Very cute. What breed??
Quick question Mr. Governor. I‚Äôm in the middle of legs and you popped up on my feed. I was wondering if you prefer all of your squat sets to be working sets after warm up, or if you use feeders to work up to 1 or 2 all out
The Puppynator
He is a big Bebe üòç
You‚Äôre my hero, man; I hope you guys have an amazing time together
What a beautiful baby, that‚Äôs a teddy bear right there!
Who is depicted by the statue behind him?
That's a full grown baby
Time to deploy Schnitzel Inu
She looks like the Schnit Schwarz.

I think that's Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Beauty!
I love you, your dog,  and all your neat knickknacks!
Love the LAST LION set behind you u/GovSchwarzenegger, any book recommendations?
