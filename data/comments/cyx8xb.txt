I admire how you took the TIME to unstick the snake safely.
Some day in the future when you are in need. The noodle will comeback to repay the the debt.
Even though I'm terrified of snakes..this is awesome
Yesterday I found a poor little danger noodle (completely harmless garter snake) tangled up in duct tape. Since we were going to be spending the day together I decided to call the noodle Emily Spinach (I have no idea if the sneks a girl or not) I spent the morning and afternoon very slowly brushing vegetable oil all over her scales to dissolve the glue and gently free each scale at a time. Unfortunately Ms. Spinach was really tangled up in the tape, fortunately she was about to molt and didn‚Äôt harm herself struggling before I found her. After freeing her from the tape she got several warm baths to remove the oil and sticky tape residue. Afterwards she wrapped herself around a bottle filled with warm water to rest and was released when she was more active and ready to go about her day. Please be very careful to dispose of tape properly, and don‚Äôt use any kind of glue traps. Snakes are a very important part of the ecosystem. Most snakes are very gentle and harmless, however please don‚Äôt handle a snake if you are unsure of what kind it is. If you see a snake that needs assistance that you can‚Äôt identify use a long stick to gently pick it up and place it into a box to take to a local wildlife rehabilitation center. Remember snakes are just wiggly forest friends and nothing to be afraid of !     ‚ú®üíñüêç üíñ‚ú®
I have to know, did Emily try to bite you while you helped it?  The video shows Emily extremely calm.
A very good visual reminder of how littering can directly harm wildlife. Thank you.
I do wildlife rehab and see far too many critters stuck and sadly dead due to tape and glue traps. You‚Äôre the BEST kind of human and we need more people like you! Thank you for saving this lovely creature. ‚ù£Ô∏èüêç‚ù£Ô∏è

I was told that pouring vegetable oil on the snake and sticky thing helps in that situation.

EDIT:  I think that's what the person is doing.  You can see the container of oil at the very beginning.

**TLDR:  If you don't want your noodles to stick, add some vegetable oil.**
I can hear it slithering off saying, ‚Äúthankssssss.‚Äù
Carry on little snek ‚ù§Ô∏è
That snake is so cute!
What a beautiful thing you did. Snakes need love too ‚ù§Ô∏è
You mean "asssssssssssistance".
My heart just exploded so here‚Äôs yours
the way you dried it off so lovingly i just... carry on, you absolute good egg you
Thought it was stuck in a candy wrapper at first. 

Forbidden licorice?
Had something very similar happen a couple years ago, found [this little guy](https://imgur.com/gallery/AEkVXjZ) with highly adhesive construction tape stuck to it. We just cut off as much as possible and let it go, I guess it's doubtful it survived but maybe it was close enough to shedding.
Not just kind, but freaky smart.
YAY! All hail the Snake Whisperer !!!! Good job!
r/HumansBeingBros
‚ÄúMy people shall know of your kindness.‚Äù
How did you even know what to do? Ive had pet snakes, but vegetable oil wouldn't come to mind. Well done good person.
Amazing! What were you using to release the adhesive?
Anyone else expect a bird of prey to come snag it up at the end?

&#x200B;

Awesome job taking care of that snake.  May it eats lots of pests/rodents for you.
You did a good job with that snake, most people wouldn't want to even touch it! By the way next time that you need to bathe a snake, add something that it can grab on to, they can get really anxious in water.
Thank you! You are a lovely human.
Thank you for rescuing poor helpless snek r/mademesmile
You the best!
Thanks for saving the lil noodle! Snakes get such a bed rep but they deserve the same kindness given to other animals.
Sticky traps for mice should be illegal. Broke my heart to hear my mom come home and said she found a snake in a sticky trap. By time she came back with oil, the other employees threw the trap away with the snake still alive. It was in the 90¬∞ they also trap birds sometimes.
You're amazing, thanks for helping the adorable noodle.
Well that was a day of sunshine in my day. Nice work!
OP, you are the kind of person my dog thinks I am.
Thank you for helping and not hurting tiny friend snek.
thanks, I love it
That was a lovely thing to do. If you are in trouble in the future, I hope that particular danger noodle comes to your rescue. That would be a great video.
I used to do pest control, always kept a bottle of oil in the car just for this purpose.
great job on helping out the danger noodle
The field behind my workplace has a couple of soccer goals, and at one point, some young coyotes were playing back there. One of them got entangled in one of the nets. It was a hot day, and when I went back to see what the situation was, the coyote was not doing well at all. people were trying to drip water into its mouth, but it was obviously just short of shock or heatstroke. One of the ladies dribbling water into its mouth had a small Swiss Army knife, and I used the scissors to start cutting the strings encircling its legs. It didn't have any cords encircling its neck. The animal seemed to calm down immediately. As though it knew that I was trying to help it. After a few minutes, it was free, and stood up and walked off into the brush. It stopped, and looked back at us, before it ran back into the woods. The only time I ever met a coyote. I've owned dogs who were not as well-behaved.
Sorry for this. My ex girlfriend really likes to get into tough situations sometimes.
I'm gonna name something Emily Spinach at some point in the future. Thanks for saving her/him x
Thanksssssss
Your jib is well cut and admirable. 
üëèüëèüëè
Good for you!
Wow you‚Äôre awesome! Thanks for helping out a reptile friend!!
May your home be nusiance rodent free.
Nice work!
Thank you for sharing a nice rescue. This is just confirming that snakes are cute animals to me
You think the snake knew you were trying to help it? Like after a while it was just like "okay, imma let them do their thing, It's almost off. Oh, now they're taking me to a bucket of water. What else is there to do, fren?"
Poor thing looked so tired! I'm glad you were able to help her, she was thankful I'm sure!
Humans are like the Deus Ex Machina to animals in this situation.
We also rescued a snek fren this year. From my shit cats. 

A bath, styptic powder and sitting in front of the space heater in July, and he was ready to go back to his family in two days üòä
I love people who show kindness to critters.
Oh my gosh, you saved it! What a lot of patient work and unflagging kindness. I know you must sleep well at night. Bless you.
this is so thoughtful and sweet
This is the most beautiful post, thank you dear kind human.
Thank you for doing this and for posting your example for others to see.  üôè
Thank you for helping the little snake.
I love the term "danger noodle" haha, anyhow take my upvote! Hope both you and Emily have good days <3
And the snake went on to visit the kind man every year for the next 10 years. Right up until he swallowed the man whole.
Steve Irwin would be very proud
Sticky traps are the worst. Thank you for being so nice to her, garter snakes are such sweet snakes üíö
This shows yet again that anyone has to stop littering. Imagine OP, the kind human being, wouldn't have seen the little danger noodle and helped her. This was a really lucky coincidence and I bet that's not the case all over the world.

Good job OP, may you always be remembered as the savior of a danger noodle.
That an awfully sticky situation
If aliens ever come to earth and select somebody to judge our species on, I hope they pick you.
That's just a noodle! No heckin danger here
Danger noodle fears no sticky situation!
And so he went. Dangerously noodling away.
This reminds me of a story of a man who once had a pet snake. The man loved the snake, fed the snake, cared and provided water for the snake.

One day the snake bit the man and the man said, "snake, I cared for you, fed you, loved you and watered you. Why did you bite me?"

To which the snake responded, "I'm a snake dumb ass!"

Seriously though, way to be a decent human!
Well that was nice of you!
Poor little snek
Bird netting is also hazardous for snakes. They can get caught in the webbing.
Awww, great job helping that snake! I sometimes wonder if they can tell that they're being helped?
Thank you for helping and for your nice words about snakes!
You good people.  Keep it up!
Question would you have done it if it was a big ole snake? And also if it was a big ole poisonous snake?
Hahaha I actually had to look up what 'danger noodle' means. I thought it was some kind of actual name of the creature. Sometimes I truly show I am not so young anymore.
We used mayo to get our pet snake off of duct tape
Snek
There‚Äôs not enough Mothafuckin‚Äô Snakes on this Mothafuckin‚Äô Sub!!

Loved this shit!!
Bless you!
Was fully expecting you to YEET the snake back into the wild at the end
I know that's just a piece of tape, but glue traps are the fucking devil.
question: would it be practical to simply feed the snake until its next shed?
Found a snake tangled in bird netting that I set free once. I was surprised and relieved when he (40+ inch black snake) wasn't scared enough to bite me!
I know I‚Äôm gonna cry when Schnoodle sees this
I love you kind danger noodle warrior
I love how she is just chilling while you help her like "ah many thanks gentle giant!"
Thank you for being such a tremendous human.
NOPE ROPE
You are super awesome! :)))) Thank you for being you.
So there is still hope for human kind
r/sneks
Thank you so much for doing that. What a wonderfully kind thing for someone to do for no other reason but being kind. You rock!
I like how the snake seems so calm like: "Oh! Human taking sticky thing off! Am being a washed!"
I hate glue traps, even enough I know this isn't a glue trap.
You are a good person. Thank you for that
You‚Äôre an awesome person.
It was really heartbreaking to see the poor little guy completely stuck to that tape.  So lucky you found it.  Thanks for brightening my day with your selfless act of kindness.
It was a tiny ‚ÄúIn-Danger‚Äù noodle. Thank you for helping him :)
You're a good man. Thank you.
I literally went through this same exact experience last week with a glue bug trap and felt so horrible I spent the better part of 40 mins slowly using olive oil to free that sucker up. He was sooooo happy to get out of there. Totally unharmed and back to snakey activities.
Well done my friend. I hope the snake lives a long and happy life.
I found almost the exact same thing one time!

A few years ago, I was working in an acting company, and we were rehearsing in this old theatre, owned by the mayor, but it didn't get a lot of traffic. There were those exact kinds of roach traps, everywhere, just little sheets of sticky plastic everywhere.

We came in to rehearse one morning, to find a garter snake had gotten caught on one, and had shimmied its way most of the way onto the stage. 

We used some expired popcorn oil, and poured that all over the poor snake, and after some careful prodding (and sad to say, a few shed scales), this popcorn-smelling noodle made his way back into grass, haha
I had my snake die from that, the duct tape was removed but it seems she died of shock a day later
Glad the snake was good, you can tell by it‚Äôs glazed over eyes it‚Äôs getting ready to shed. Which makes it extra important to be gentle.

Source - own snek
That's not a danger noodle, that's just a noodle. Garter snakes are a danger to no one.
I absolutely love snakes! ü•∞üò≠ Thank you for being kind and gentle to this sweetie. ü•∞
You may be a Druid; I applaud you O protector of the little slitherings!
Garter snakes are seriously sweet hearts both  captive and wild
I‚Äôm curious what the typical prey of such a small snake would be. I know they can swallow things larger than their own head but that‚Äôs not saying much in this case. Even the smallest rodents would be rather large for it.
If there's a heaven you get to go.
Nope rope
I'll never understand people who don't find danger noodles to be adorable. All sizes are so cute and snugly and wonderful to behold
r/humansbeingbros
Thanksssss amigo
Can't tell if that's a glue traps or not but for future reference for anyone baby oil will disolve the glue.

In high school we found a mouse on a glue trap, teacher sent me to the corner store for baby oil.
As a snake lover I thank you for this kind deed. Snake get such a bad rap around the world, but they are beautiful and fascinating animals.
Very nice refurbished snake
When I was a kid, I purposefully killed a toad. Still think about it in regret, decades later.
In-Danger Noodle
Doing it with a gartner snake is one thing... a few years back my brother and I did a similar thing with a baby dugite (a highly venomous elapid). 

Someone had found it in their room, and sealed it in the room by putting tape around the door so it could stay put until a snake relocater (my brother) arrived. Unfortunately, it did try to go underneath the door, and ended up stuck on the tape. 

It was understandably very cross, and wouldn't settle down, and was quite bitey as one might imagine. Even with gloves on, it was still moving around way too much for us to remove it from the tape. After an hour of trying with almost no success, we put it in the fridge, which wasn't ideal, but the poor guy had no chance of survival if he was stuck to the tape, so we gave it a try. Luckily it worked, and although it took several hours and a few more 'cool-off sessions'. We kept him in an enclosure and nursed him back to health over the next three days, and he seemed thrilled to be back in his home when we let him go.
yeh, that woulda been a go ahead and end its suffering type a deal for me. NICE!
Even if it tried to bite me afterwards I wouldn't be upset. Good snake, gooder redditor
Has anyone on reddit ever used the word snake?  Jesus fucking Christ.
U rock
You are a wonderfully decent person! Bravo. I love sneks so I'm glad this one was so well taken care of!
Thanks for helping our snek boi
This isn't a danger noodle, it's just your regular garden variety ground noodle
It's a fuckin snake.
its a fucking snake. for the love of god call it a snake.
Do you mean a fucking snake???
blessed
Love the term ‚Äúdanger noodle‚Äù and will use it forever and always from now on! Thanks for having such devotion to saving this one!
You‚Äôre a better person than I. Generally I tend to keep a 20ft distance between me and any sneks I encounter.
I fell into a nest of these when I was very small and it scarred me for life.   If I see one I start hyperventilating and freeze in place.   Im just so terrified of them on a whole new level.

I'm glad you helped this snake.   I would want to help but I'd be too petrified to go anywhere near it.   Thank you for posting this vid, you're wonderful for helping and it helps me see they're not so bad.  :)

There is a special place in heaven for youüíó
This is so amazing 
I remember as a kid my cat would attack little sneks and I'd always try to save them lol
They typically survived and I think they appreciated the snacks

Omg lil pup was so good
Every time I read danger noodle I think it's going to be a hot.
Oh poor thing. Thank you for helping her.
This is such a sweet story.
Dawww! That's so cute. And the Snek seemed to get the gist you were helping. 

People misunderstand them. I'm a bit skittish of them, but I still come to their rescue when need be (was picking my kid up, and a family of gardeners were being picked at by kids, I promptly moved mom and babies back in their hole. Which is weird cause mom usually doesnt stick around right? )
Very sweet! Thank you for being so patient with Emily Spinach. What a cute snake! I did notice she looked blue; she might not have been able to see the tape well before she accidentally slithered onto it.
You have a good and gentle heart. The world need more folks like you.
You are a solid, good person. 

And I assure you, the snake knows it too. 

Good job. Very good job!

Is she your danger noodle now
I used to catch garter snakes every summer as a kid.  Catch one and keep it thru out the summer and release them at the end of the summer.

My mom caught one and a couple weeks later we were trying to figure out where all the little worms came from.  Turns out the one snake my mom ever caught was pregnant.

Also one summer we caught one that would imitate a rattlesnake by hitting its tail against the cage.
Found the new redditor!
Aw I‚Äôm sure he went back to his little snake bro and snake sis explaining to them that a very nice gentleman freed him from a very sticky situation
Aw the care you gave this snek brought a tear to my eye. <3
Found the new redditor!
You are a very good human, I hope you have good luck for the rest of your life and everyday you have good moments like finding something you lost, or just realising you have another biscuit left with your tea, or finding a good bit of change in the couch. You deserve all good things always. Karma will be very kind to you.
how did it get so far in the first place?
You've gotten plenty of praise but after reading your comment about the importance of snakes to the ecosystem, I have to add to it. I love you and thank you so much.

Ill take bugs outside but this is something else. You are an excellent person.
From now on I will only refer to snakes as danger noodles
In your opinion, which is best: Danger noodle, Spooky noodle, or Live Spaghetti(
Sooo cute, we dont get any of the cute snakes in australia.
I love you for doing this <3
Holy shit have you been heavily awarded. It is deserved.
Thank you OP you ROCK!
That snake was in blue (you could tell by the eyes) which is the stage right before shedding.

As someone who hates flying things (which is mostly a nope ropes diet), I appreciate that.
Wholesome post. Humans CAN be awesome!
I saw a video today of a guy who went looking for his goat that had gotten lost in the woods. What he found instead was a big snake with a giant, goat-shaped lump in its belly. The snake was I think dying or something from having swallowed such a large animal, so the man and some friends of his helped the snake regurgitate the goat, then let the snake slither back off into the woods.

It was both disgusting and heartwarming. I decided against posting the video on Reddit but I'll bet someone does soon enough.
You might even call it a tape worm
Thank you for helping this sweet baby üíï
Am I the only one who half expected OP to yeet the danger noodle into the woods at 0:51? ü§£ (Seriously glad you didn't, however. Thank you for saving snek! üòò)

I'd be too freaked out to do that but good for you! Honestly I've wonder why for years, why are people afraid of snakes..like spiders..why they dont want to hurt us they're just very creepy.
Way to go, buddy!
Cute snake, super glad some asshole bird didn't snatch him away immediately after all that effort.
One of my brother's snakes got out of his cage and got caught in a spider glue trap. We did the same thing for the noodley dude and hes back to doing well
Probably completely overemotional but you made my entire week with this, I love you.
Which type of danger noodle is it ?strangle noodle or venom noodle ?
You are a great human being!!!
Thank you. Snakes are my favorite and most people wouldn't give a shit about a noodle in need. You're my new favorite human.
His eyes look like he was a few days away from shedding.

As someone who hates to see animals in pain, but also hates snakes, I'm torn. Good job though
The smallest acts of kindness often renew my faith in humans. Not a big snake fan, but this touched my heart.
Given the gradual taper of the tail I think it's safe to assume that it is an Emily spinach and not an Emilio
I once found a lizard stuck and still alive on a glue trap at work. You could tell the poor thing had been stuck for quite some time as it was clearly dehydrated. I legit cried. My coworker at the time told me to just throw it away. I was like, hell no. I brought it home with me where I painstankingly removed it from the glue trap using vegetable oil. It took me a good three hours to get it freed from the trap and remove all the glue residue. (Had to be extra careful with its tiny feet.) 

Once I was done, it hung out on my hand until it warmed up and I then released it back outside.
Better nate than lever.
Hold me closer, tiny danger (noodle)
You deserve some sort of award.
This is wholesome.
‚ÄúTHANKSSSSSSSSS‚Äù
I love nope ropes dude, ur awsome for saving a wiggle branch! Slippery tube dudes are just so awsome. Like I wish i had caution ramen as a pet.
I terrified of snakes, but I hate those gd sticky traps. Thank you for helping it.
Out of couriosity, what was used to help this little guy out? I was trying to guess but was it olive oil?
I had this same thing happen at a place I worked at. I was able to get the noodle free from the sticky trap but unfortunately it died shortly after as I'm guessing it was trapped for too long without any water. Poor noodle bro, I tried to help...
Was legit waiting for a bird to come at the end and carry the danger noodle off, like what happened to those kids that released their bunny.
Thanks for saving the smol noodle. Been kinda moody recently, so seeing this made my day.

Oh TIL that it's garter snake not garden snake...damn you Michigan Accents making me call things the wrong name for years...
I hope that somewhere in her tiny reptilian brain she realised you were helping her and was thankful. In fact, she probably went home and said ‚ÄúGeez, first I got stuck in duct tape, then some pervert came along and started touching me up and tickling me with a paintbrush! Come my scaly sisters, let us declare war on the warm bloods!!‚Äù

Sorry, got a bit carried away there!
The comments on this post are a rollercoaster.
I've had to do the same with a baby lizard stuck on a fly trap, yknow the glue ones ?
The thing was half the size of my pinky.
Terribly afraid it's skin would tear off because of the glue or that I would break one of its bones.
I kept going at it with water but even once it was free of the glue paper, its legs kept on sticking to its body. I had to carefully grab and pull to get it free.
Had to let it sit in baby powder for a bit. I put some all over his body hoping that when it rains, it wouldn't wash out and start sticking again.
All in one it must have taken me a good 30min.

When I was done, I put it outside, in a cardboard "house" my little sisters had made.

And then not 1 min later when someone asked to see it, I turned around to realise the wind had blow the fucking thing away.
Wow i am scared of snakes but thanks to you i want one. Thank you for curing me from my anxity from snakes.
I dunno why I thought you were going to toss her into the bushes at the end. üòÖ
Judging by the eyes, this little noodle is about to go into shed! This stressful event will probably effect that shed negatively, but, you helped it make it less so :3

Too bad she couldn‚Äôt shed her skin at that moment to escape the tape.

Well done. Thank you.
I had to do this to two king snakes trapped on some tape on a cardboard box in my carport. I felt so bad not knowing how long they‚Äôd been there but I‚Äôm happy I was able to help.

Looked like a garter snake. 

Thought danger noodles were the venomous/huggy variety. 

Unless I completely misidentified that snake, in which case feel free to correct me. It‚Äôs pretty awesome either way.
Not many people would stop to help out a little snake, this is pretty heartwarming
You are doing human the right way.
I was mortified with how rough you were until I realized it was a brush. Well done for using proper method and saving such a CUTE little garter snake!
This was really amazing and inspiring to watch. Thank you for saving that danger noodle's life. We need more of that in this world.
That‚Äôs awesome! Thanks so much for being a sweet human!
"yes, waiter, I would like a bowl of danger noodles, uncooked and to go, please"
Found a similar one in a spider web the other day and helped him escape... didnt take quite as long tho.  good on you, still cant believe a spider caught a snake
You are a really awesome person! I was raised with snakes and would have been insure of what to do. Now I know. Maybe one day I can help a Danger noodle too!
You are a good man.
You can really see the compassion you showed in this video. I could use a danger noodle in my garden, I have a mouse problem he would be great for the job.

This reminds me when my best friend performed midnight bee surgery when we were down in Mexico. 

It wasn't even close to surgery, but that's what I called it. We found a waterlogged bee near the pool late at night, and she jumped into action. Made grabbed some sugary medicine and tried to get him back up and buzzing. She tried so hard to get him to slurp it up, but the lil guy didn't make it. I think she was a little bit gutted that she lost him. I was sad too. 

But it also reminded me why she's my best friend. She's a wonderful person.
The internet needs more of this, heck, the WORLD needs more of this!
What a cute spaghetti
I don‚Äôt know what i find more intriguing, your patience or that the snake hung around even after the tape was removed. It looks like it really trusted you!
What a wonderful thing to do!

Reddit has done something to my brain.

In the part right before you let the noodle go, when you were standing at the edge of the tree line. I was waiting for one of 2 things.

1) you to full on over hand throw that snake in to the woods.

2) a bird to come down and steal the snake.

I like the actual outcome much better.
Thanks so much for taking care of this precious one!üêç
This is so incredibly kind. Thank you.
You are a good good person
r/snakes loves you forever üòç
NOT a danger noodle, just a harmless garden snake.
‚ÄúThankssss‚Äù
Ahh yes a tiny danger noodle
'Thank you human, I will not forget thissssssssssssssssss'.
Awwww
Thank you so much for helping her so gently
You mean hazard spagetti?
Just a noodle, no danger to it. Courtsey r/snek.
*tried to do that to a tiger snake in Australia*

*dies*
Have I really gone my whole life without hearing the term danger noodle.
My snek got stuck to some tape when I first got her, lubed her up with coconut oil and it came right off. That said it wasnt nearly as sticky as that tape/glue trap looks
The noodles remember.

Edit: also FUCK GLUE TRAPS. IF YOU USE THESE YOU'RE OBJECTIVELY A BAD PERSON.
This world needs more people like you.
Looks like little Emily was also in blue. So she might have gotten stuck due to poor eyesight since she was close to shedding. She was such a good girl. Garters are such nice sneks.
This made me so happy, how sweet üíóüêçüçú  
Thank you for helping the lil snek
Your assistance is appreciated
I wish my girlfriend will touch me the way you touch this noodle
Something I don't like about myself is that I wouldn't be capable of helping in that sort of situation at all.   


So very happy you were capable and did.
Thank you for helping the lil snek!
That's so kind!
"Had a stuck. Tall, kind monkey removed the stuck and gave me a bath. Then head pets and put me back on grass without the stuck. 9/10 would recommend. Only complaint was lack of complimentary mint."
How did you unstick him?? What's the liquid you're using? Even though the odds of me finding a snek friend in this situation I feel that I have to know how to help just in case I do.
Aww cute little snookey booper
What were you using to unstick her? Was there a special liquid on the paintbrush?
^("THANKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.")
Doesnt the title "danger noodle" require it to have venom?
Anyone who knows how to properly rehab wild animals in distress *deserves* 100k upvotes
Cool bro you did good üòäüòäüòÅ
Well done good sir!!
I had a chipmunk gets its ass end stuck to a glue trap in my garage - It ran around in circles dragging the glue trap while I sprayed cooking oil spray on the glue, eventually it got loose and ran off. It was pretty funny for me, but the chipmunk was probably terrified.
Thanks for helping that adorable noodle. You have a heart of gold!
It was very kind of you to carefully free the little noodle instead of just ripping the tape off.
Gahdang danger noodle spa yer running now. GOOD LUCK!
Oh my God, I think that snake is also in blue. This is the most chill wild snake I've ever seen. most CAPTIVE snakes get upset if they're handled in blue. Such a good noodle.
Oil, people. Oil and patience!
That must've been quite painful, but it warms my heart to see someone rescuing an animal that so many are afraid of, and remembering how valuable they are to a healthy ecosystem. Thank you! Thank you times as many scales as you saved by your slow and gentle methods!
That noodle is so lucky it found you! Thank you for your help!
Emily Spinach reminds me of my cat.
Great job!
Yes, large applause. Very well done. I admire your zeal.
You are awesome üíöüêçüêç
Should have just evolved to Arbok duh. 

Also never heard a snake called a Danger Noodle lmao
No step on snek
Good job on helping that SNAKE
 My snek is happy with you, I‚Äôm holding him
oh that poor baby!! fyi, mineral oil or olive oil are very useful in these situations, and most people have one of them in their house
Garden snake: I was saved by a human! They can be trusted.

Snake 2: The Humans made the trap 

Garden Snake: ‡≤†_‡≤†
You have big karma coming your way
Good work, OP!
Faith in Humanity restored
Actually looks to be a Dekay's Brownsnake. Mine has the same checkered pattering. Never saw a garter with it.
Good in you, sir!
Straight from being saved to innocently being run over by my lawn mower.
Alright, I'm going to admit it. I am terrified of and hate snakes. I always have been scared of them, since I was a child and one startled me in the grass. This video made me literally say "aww" and for the first time in my life, I had empathy for an animal I typically loathe! Thank you and bravo!
Spoiler alert: this gif is actually in reverse. OP cleaned a danger noodle to glue it to a piece of paper while it was still alive.
Danger noodle! üòÜüòÜ so cute
Bless you for this service ‚ô•Ô∏è

Also for the term ‚Äúdanger noodle‚Äù üòÇ
Coconut oil is really easy to apply (as long as you don't cover their mouth or nose) and allows them to wriggle free once the oil has soaked in.We like this method as it doesn't require any poking or prodding or peeling, but the oil will dissolve the glue from glue traps and allows the trapped animal to unglue themselves - less stress.
you cant find a cuter name for a baby snake than 'tiny danger noodle'
Are we calling snakes "danger noodles" now?
D A N G E R   N O O D L E
Years of evolution tells me to run for some reason
Snake. It's called a snake.
Snakes and spiders, noble creatures!
I hate these in-humane sticky POS traps and whatever dumb fuck made them. More than just bugs get trapped to these and the trapped (but still living) bugs often bring even more unintended predators that get caught which brings even more predators of the previous ones. Fuck those traps and fuck you if you use them.
What did you use to loosen him? Baby oil?
Why the insistence on on "danger noodle" this is as bad as pupper and all that shit
You are a good person. Unlike me, who accidentally slaughters them with the weed wacker.
That's a fuck no from me.
For some reason the internet lurker in me assumed he was about to chuck that snake hard into the brush when he was holding it near the end.
I thought you pulled the ultimate switcheroo and placed it back on fresh tape at the end... phew 

dunno how you even knew how to look after it so well! good job
OP is obviously up to something suspiscious, probably bought this account, or is selling it.

I never believe people who have popular posts on previously unused accounts.

Did you put the tape on the snake op?
Why does this make me think about neosporin ü§î
When I saw him holding it near the grass i totally though he was just gonna chuck it to set it free lol
Who the friggin uses orange duct tape? Prob some hippy chick doing arts and crafts, ironically the hippy chick litters.
For some reason I thought you were gonna YEET it back into the grass lol.
–ù–∞—Ö—É—è?
Suddenly, *eagle*
Thought that was a nope rope for a sec.
Made him into a wet noodle
*tiny nope rope
It's in blue. It would have she's and left
I had to do this once :-( felt so bad for the poor thing.
What happened to the little guy
>Thanksss, amigo
Do you guys think it knows that the OP is helping?
You really did that snake a solid!
The lil screm of freedom at the end awww
Wait. So, all I gotta do to keep snakes out is put duct tape around the perimeter of my yard?
What happened exactly? What was it stuck on and how?
Haha what if right after they got them off it snapped at their fingers and then ran away like "Haha suckers I just wanted a snack"
Bless you Fren
Name the danger noodle
Poor little noodle =<
 you are a good person
Good human
Aaaaannd... it bites him
He is such a cute dancer noddle. Why didn‚Äôt you keep him as a pet!?
Venemous or no?
how da heck ... superb assisting
Ah snakes ahh
Came here hoping to find a comment from /u/TheSortingHat saying ‚ÄúSLYTHERIN!‚ÄùüòÇüôå
Now you just need some Miso soup
Who puts tape on snake?
There‚Äôs just a lot of good souls out there doing the best they can to be helpful don‚Äôt get it twisted
From this day onward I'm gonna call all sneks DANGER NOODLES lmao Thanks
***Danger noodle. I love it.***
What does snakes this big eat ?
saving the danger noodle
Aww, I'm so happy she ended up with someone who could help her and understood that she needed to be released after being helped! Thank you so much for this!
The real MVP
Everyone needs frenssssssssssssss!
You‚Äôre a kind soul. I like ppl like you.
Humans being Bros
*gets eaten by bird*
Funny thing, this happened to my dad a while back (caught a snake in some duct tape by mistake). It was a grass snake and he tried to free it but he was unable to :(
I'm not a danger noodle extraordinare, what kind of snake is this?
should of said "assssssssistance"
Their eyes dont look that great, probably needed that bath to get their shed loose.
Awwww‚ô•Ô∏è
Hoooold me closer tiny daaancer. Thought it said that at first. Good job though OP.
Awwww thank you for saving that precious noodle
That is an extremely relaxed, tame and trusting danger noodle.
Aww poor baby, what'd he he stuck in?
Nice one!
I really don‚Äôt care for snakes, but this was awesome of you. Big props!
You are amazing at life. Keep up the incredible work!
You are a good human beeing. Rare, but does actually exist.
Can you wait for it to shed skins?
Smol snek
"You knew I was a snake when you took me in"
You're a good human!!!
Was that a heated bottle of water? Pretty clever.
I wonder if it knows its being helped
Thank you so much for helping the little guy!!!
aww bless you for being kind.
I'll take spiders and bugs trapped and put em outside. That's said, I'd think twice about a snake. A wild animal is still a wild animal. You are a true friend of nature. Blessed be to you.
A danger noodle in quite a pickel
Now kith
I had the same happen with glue traps and a nice little tree frog in front of my place. Cue 30 minutes of carefully unsticking the little guy and giving him some water to rest in out of the sun. I had to remind my wife that glue traps aren't meant to be set up outdoors.
Orochimaru would be thankful
Oh you met KD? Cool.
Glue traps are just barbaric.

You are a beautiful person, OP. Snek seems happy <3
Do we need to stop using tapes now?
What did you use to get the little guy unstuck??
Leaves a 4 star review
You really took care of the little guy! That was very kind of you!
OP you're a saint. I would have mercy killed it.
Patient noodle
Came here to say that I fucking hate people but then it occurred to me it was a person who saved the snek. So I'd like to clarify and say I only hate most people.
Can‚Äôt tell what‚Äôs going on, is she frozen to a sock?
I‚Äôm surprised it did so well; at the beginning of the clip I thought it was a goner! Good for you for helping it out!
I tried this once with a house mouse I found as it got stuck to a moth catcher in the pantry and it bit me ü§òüèªü§òüèªü§òüèª
Awww you‚Äôre so nice! Thank you for saving the snek! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you human!
OP what were you using to brush that snake with?
Love danger noodles.
Zuckerberg thanks you for saving his family member
That's a garter snake. So non-poisonous.
What a nice little snek
Providing some awwsistance, I see.

Missed naming opportunity for /r/humansbeingbros, though a bit limiting, I suppose.
Little guy had a nice day at the spa. A full body scrub and wash. Lookin fresh for them lady snakes now.
That little guy was surprisingly calm, must have sensed you were there to help and not harm ‚ù§
awwwWWWwWWwWW!! thank you for saving this little baby!!
I love snakes thanks for this
I don‚Äôt even like danger noodles, but I like this one.
what are those weird jelly bean and explodey things that are gilded to OP
You‚Äôre good people :)
At times end, when this Snake comes back to devour the earth, you will be her one Avatar she spares.
What a well behaved noodle
I'm so happy people like you exist! I'm sure he was a very happy noodle afterward.
I'm extremely disappointed you didn't just yeet it into the grass after taking all that time and care to free and wash it.
Thank you for being a good person.
Garter snakes aren't "danger" noodles IMO..
Scarred by previous vids... Was expecting a bird to swoop in at the end.
This is the only word I use for them now lol
The danger noodle also said "thank you!".
Danger noodle lol
Great Job
 awesome
I like how just as I started watching this, Down Under started playing on the radio
You are the hero we need, and the hero we don't deserve
Tiny danger noodle üòÇ definitely my new favourite saying for snakes! üëå
You do good work
So where did those tools come from?!
Bird lands from nearby tree. Eats snake.
Lol danger noodle
How sure are you that he's really a "Danger" noodle? You know alot about sneks?
good work hooman
Sneks are my #1 fear tho ;( I has no courage to do this for a danger noodle.
Was that his ripped off skin on the sticky pad??! ‚òπÔ∏è
*thanksssssssss*
very kind of you üëçüèΩalot of people wouldn't know what to do or too nervous to do it.. great job
Well done üëèüëèüëè
Bless you!
My boyfriend and I used to live at his mom's house and she used those damn sticky traps all over the house. For a while every night after she went to bed, boyfriend and I sneaked out and found all the mice stuck in the traps, then sat on the porch and set them all free using oil. It was a pain but totally worth it.
HOW
Nicely done.
Good human.
I'm glad you saved it , can reptiles love and show affection like dogs?, If it was human size im sure it wouldn't think twice in eating you üòÇ
This is so sweet. I loved seeing this.
This unexpectedly made me very emotional
It's so cute! Poor noodle.
He's more like a hazard noodle
The snake looks blind?
I was waiting for a bird to swoop it out of nowhere after release
I enjoyed watching you polish your noodle.
What a sweet, patient little noodle!
üíïüíï
The world needs more people like you.
This is exactly how to treat animals. You madam/sir, are a good person.
Thankssss
"Danger noodle" has me cracking up
Danger noodle, that's awesome
Me playing with my friend
Was waiting for that yeet
That‚Äôs the most gentle rescue I have ever seen.
Very kind of you. I love how careful you were to it. Thank You!
What an adorable nope rope!
He's so patient
Ahh my heart! A blessed wee nood.
Thank you so much for your empathy and care!
And that‚Äôs how ramen is made
I like you a lot, OP.
u/707cutthoatcommitee so cute
I‚Äôm not a fan of reptiles, but I am a fan of kindness!
God bless you and your Danger Noodle saving ways üêçüíö
Cute little nope rope
Did this once, but I used that dish soap from the commercials since that's all I know, fucker came in and stole my cigarettes wallets and blew it all on scratchers
This is why you dont fucking throw trash outside! Awesome job OP, the little guy looks so happy afterwards!
What was used to get the tape off of him, some sort of solvent remover?
Did he musk all over you?
you're an inspiration. well done mate!
Do snakes know they are being helped or are they just like "shit, I am one lucky snake"?
Thank you!
Awww op you are a wonderful hoomin bean!
That‚Äôs cold blooded
Different snake towards the end of the video.
Upvote for the name. Danger noodle.
As much as I have Ophidiophobia, I think she‚Äôs cute.
r/humansbeingbros
Just think of the amount of animals that got entangled in our trash and died without anyone ever finding out. (not in time to save them at least)

Throw your shit in a garbage bin, it's not as hard as you think.
IM VERY PROUD OF WHAT I DID FOR THAT REPTILE
how dangerous
i wonder how that lil guy got stuck like that
Could the ‚Äúhuman race‚Äù be human like you! Thank you for doing it for this animal and thank you for showing us...
Who knows it changes ‚Äúhumans‚Äù...
Awesome!
The poor think looks like it's in pre-shed too
You are a good person, thank you
You're such a good person for helping the little guy, regardless if the little noodle knew whether or not you were helping. I am so thankful for people like you in the world, keep doing you!
This is so sweet, gentle, patient, and kind! Thank you for caring!
Water is amazing!
Beautiful. Such a cute snek! This shows, again, why you shouldn't litter as well.
When watching at first, I thought it was stuck to a Reese's chocolate wrapper and was wondering why it was so sticky.
Congratulations on being a superbly compassionate human being.
Was waiting for the bite
Oh you fixed it! Well done, well done.
You deserve to keep him and give him a life he'll never forget with treats and stuff and cuddles. PepeHands
Was that a warm bottle at the end? Does the alcohol evaporating make the snake cold?
Awww
Upvote for sure dont understand why moat humans cant be decent or civil with animals
Thank you üëç
What a nice and polite snake
What did you use?
Holly shit! ...tape is super effective against snake type??
Silly snake, that tape is for ducks!
Thank you for being so kind
What flavour of noodle is this?
Poor lil noodle
