‚ÄúOh, and it would be great if you stopped eating my scales and just chewed your fucking fingernails instead. They‚Äôre made out of the same stuff.  Thanks.‚Äù
He's just so polite.
I wish pangolins were 8 ft. tall. I don't know why, I just with they were really really big.
So adorable I want to squeeze him! (Not too hard and only if he would like)
15/10 would invite this missionary in to learn about his lord and savior
He is once again asking for our support.
This is Honey Bun from the nature documentary "The Worlds Most Wanted Animal" on PBS. He passed away today
For some reason, I thought of this guy as that one character from Office Space. I pictured it asking, "Excuse me. Have you seen my stapler?"

*sobbing* Anything for you Pangolin
Can someone photoshop a hat in his hands?
LAY IT ON ME LITTLE BROTHER
How could anybody hurt something this cute and sweet? He's not bothering anybody, just minding his own business doing pangolin stuff. Bless his little heart.
Do you have something you want to sell me?
"I have wares if you have coin, traveler."
He reminds me of the little mole in Once Upon a Forest
beautiful creature-stop the wildlife trade. China is one of the worst perpetrator of wildlife extinction, with more creatures like this landing dead on their shores
Perfect title
Hello my name is ed and I speak for the leaves and the earth and the earths says, ‚ÄúCOVID is just a warning‚Äù
i read something somewhere that said pangolins always looks like they‚Äôre trying to nervously ask you to prom and i agree and it‚Äôs adorable
Idk why but I imagined that it had a lisp
Sandshrew? That you?
Honestly I don't understand how anyone can pick up something so ADORABLE and innocent looking, just to cut it up and sell for some fake medical nonsense.
Yes sir, I do indeed have a moment.
I am once again asking for your emotional support
‚ÄúUmm does anyone have a laptop charger I could borrow?‚Äù

I read this in Milton‚Äôs voice for some reason
Snooooof!
I have all the moments you need
He looks like he's about to sell me some armour
Sir? The prisoners, they‚Äôve... well... escaped.
"How's Covid? Idiots"
Uh, excuse me, if you could stop believing in witchcraft (aka Chinese Traditional Medicine) then maybe my species might have a chance at surviving the next 20 years.
I has a moment for him.
Yes.  For the first time, pangolin, I DO have a moment to speak about the environment.
I'm getting Baby Yoda vibes from this creature...
We all eat the 4th most intelligent animal for breakfast.
There's a documentary on Netflix about these cuties.

I would love to speak to you mr Pangolin

I never knew what pangolins looked like. They are adorable.
I know nothing about cats.
Melt.
Pangolin would like to trade its wares for coin good traveler.
It looks like a cross between a turtle, armadillo and sloth and I fucking love it
What a beautiful critter
I likea the pangolin
I do now!
I don't know why but I fucking love Pangolins so goddamn much. This pic may have had something to do with it
10/10 would not pretend to not speak English for this little guy
"Hey bro.. Mom said it's my turn on the Xbox"
A wild Sandshrew appeared
"Can you find something to eat except for me?"
Sandsdhrew
OMG a Goron from the Zelda series!! Awesome!
Well, yes, it so happens that I do.
I think he looks like he wants to convince me that Gaia is our lord and savior.
The lorax?
I like pink fairy armordillos.
It looks so polite
I would listen to him for hours.
I fucking love Pangolins!
Omg he looks so polite! Can we invite him in...
For you I would clear my whole schedule
Yes. Yes, I do. Please enlighten me in your thoughts and concerns.
I do. I will protect you, and the environment for eternity. Even if that may be ten years not ten thousand
WELL YES I DO THANKS FOR ASKING YOU LITTLE ARMOURED BOI
If a pangolin Jehovah's Witness knocked on my door looking like this I'd listen to his spiel
Pangolins and Wombats are hella cute
HE IS SO FRIENDLY
That depends.....Did you happen to talk to a "bat" before you got to me?
He speaks for the trees
Pangolins are weirdly adorable. They always look like they are sheepishly getting ready to ask you something.
Just 16 minutes could save you up to 16% off your current insurance rate
Excuse me, could you please stop trafficking me and my family...
Sorry about the covid, guys. Maybe you shouldn't have eaten me. I am endangered
The other day was the first time I‚Äôve heard of Pangolins. My sister sent me a list of good vibe animals and bad vibe animals. This guy was on the good vibe list and I had to google it
Isn't it so cute guys. wow. Wonders of nature
Is this a Pangolin?
‚ÄúD‚Äôya wanna develop an app?‚Äù
He‚Äôs like stop eating my family!
Do you have games on your phone?
"Do you want to develop an app?"
Him be very polite
More then a moment i want to hear it all
According to some of the reporting on npr, pangolins were possibly in cages underneath bats, both for sale at the wet market. And ‚Äúbush meat‚Äù seems to be a strange generic term for meat from small wild animals. At least that‚Äôs what I recall from January‚Äôs covid reportsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I hope they stop killing this creature!
yes yes I have all the time for this little cutie to speak about the environment ! Awwwwww so cuteee
I am the Lorax and I speak for the trees...
I love pangolins they're rather nice creatures.

And they eat ants which plague my house so I wish I had one
I met a pangolin in Zimbabwe last year. He had a man who was by his side 24/7, and took him to areas with lots of ants so that the pangolin could eat all day long.
That's actually so fucking cute I want to find him and plant him a forest
ill be walking through the biggest square in stockholm, past 5 Amnesty people, 3 WWF workers, a whole crew from the red cross..

but this..

when i see this little guy asking to talk about the environment you bet your ASS ill sit straight down, on the nasty urban pavement, and ill listen to whatever they have to say.

good boy.
Hello, I am the lorax, speaker of the tree. Stop cutting em down or I'll break your knees
"if you stopped eating animals, youd severely reduce the amount of viruses and global pandemics! plus stop antibiotic resistance. plus, killing animals for food is kind of fucked up now that you dont need to. and you waste almost 50 times the amount of water and crops feeding livestock. over ‚Öì of all of the pollution your species puts out is from killing us and other animals"

what a wise lil guy
 she‚Äôs from that crowd.
If the animal rescue organizations used this little one they wouldn't have any trouble getting money. I wanna pick this little guy up and cuddle him!
Hehe Baby Pangolin
The pangolin is a suspect for transmitting Covid to humans
in Brazil that's a tatu, isn't it?
In a messed up kinda way, I wish the pangolin was easy enough to keep as a pet. I know it‚Äôs not the most moral of arguments, but if that were the case they most likely wouldn‚Äôt be endangered.
Oh my goodness!!! What is it?? I dont have these in my state... atleast not that I know of. Its cute!!
Poor guy better run there‚Äôs Chinese around they‚Äôll make a soup out of him.
Pangolin?
Can someone photoshop him in front of some butt cracks at a Magic the Gathering convention?
Is life not sacred if you‚Äôre an animal?
I would gladly listen for as long as he likes!
I feel for these beautiful creatures that are being treated cruelly in many countries!!
Other than the cute face it looks like the Rancor from Return of the Jedi lol
‚ÄúCould you keep it down? It‚Äôs 8am.‚Äù
Yes, absolutely, sir.

They've been poached to the verge of extinction. Pangolins are so rare nowadays that when one wandered into a village in North India couple of days ago, people got scared of the "strange" animal and hundreds gathered to watch it until the forest officials came to its rescue.
Don't do this to me. I have cried enough tonight but you keep bringing it back.

If you've never had scrambled eggs, and you look like a pinecone on four legs, guess what? You're a pangolin! O dee o dee o.

For you dear, anything
Uh. Excuse me! Can I get some of them?
If you want to help the environment I would urge you to look into veganism as animal agriculture is one of the largest environmental polluters. Google 'Challenge 22' or feel free to DM me with any queries.
Anything for you sandshrew!
I would be more worried about certain someones harvesting you for bullshit medicine.

No I don't have a moment, I have eternity.
Wow I didn't know sandshrew exists in this world.
No.
Once again I am asking for your support.
Pangolins defy all logic, they should be this hideous creature with their weird pink claws, derpy walking, dirty hard scales and weird eyes, yet they are so utterly cute and adorable. 

Amazing creatures, they should be left alone in the wild and I am so sick of countries like china and their barbaric practices against these incredible critters.

Environment is our reflection.
They always seem like they're a message and nervious about having to delivery bad news to an emotional evil king
I would just like to point out to all the people ragging on the Chinese and their traditional medicine, there is a large swath of the American population that buy into bullshit medicine. They call it holistic medicine, though. It‚Äôs just culturally we are primed to accept it because it‚Äôs not animal based and Chinese traditional medicine is. Both a stupid and both have plenty of access to prove how much bullshit it all is. What‚Äôs important to note is humans are happy to be willfully ignorant no matter where they reside and both ‚Äútraditions‚Äù are medically negligent.

Thanks for Covid, Pangolin...
Yes. Yes I do
I dont know why i hear this in Korgs voice from Thor.
They are so precious! I would adopt them all in free, protected ranges, if I could.
Is that a pangolin?
Don't wanna generalise!
Nothing like wiping out a species for jank ass snake oil cures for your weiner amirite? Humans are the best.
Yes i have a minute or two
I do, Sandshrew. I have lots of time to speak about the environment!
Africans need to stop using these cute fuckers as bush meat.  They're adorable.
This looks like a hand-made figure, is this a real pangolin?
I will vote for him/her
You‚Äôve said plenty when you (probably) gave us Sars-Cov-2 you little dude.
Dude Chinese medicine literally is like these rare animals and they make it cost so much cause there rare animals and the know the cure and they just put a drop and are like it‚Äôs cause the exotic animal yeh
