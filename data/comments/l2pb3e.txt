Must be so confused
Aww poor baby
Well on the bright side, you've got a puppy treadmill!
What kind of hamster is that??
The dog is not turning the carousel, the owner is.
Adorable. Though the song conjures memories that are not so cute...
Aww poor baby wants out
Someone is spinning the bottom off camera
Free the poor thing
[deleted]
Place your bets and pet your pet
AND I WILL WALK 500 MILES!
Some say he’s still walking to this day...
Get out of there Susan!
Welcome to PuppySpin ! You have spun the puppy 10 times !
"We call this cabinet the Hotel California."
Sisypups
A repost? Seriously?
I mistakenly read the title as "mistakes we all made" and when I saw the video I was like 

&#x200B;

yeah that's pretty relatable

&#x200B;

why
u/savevideo
meatspin
Legend has it that he's still spinning
Thats real lazy there Susan.
someones down there pushing it..
Cuteness is never a mistake
The doggo on the spin-o goes round and round
Someones def spinning this right
Here's a radical idea: Maybe most videos are just fine with their original sound?

Also, if you would kindly step off my lawn.
When you try your best but you don’t suceeeeeeeeeeed!
Me trying to escape my responsibilities
He'll grow out of it...
Meatspin.com
Time to put a kebab station on the counter top!
<3 Puppy
Oh, he never returned, no he never returned, and his fate is still unlearned. He will ride forever ‘neath the streets of Boston; he’s the man who never returned. 🎶
anyone else feel sad watching this? like no put down the camera and help the baby ):

edit: spelling
I bet there's someone turning the spinny thing by the bottom wheel
How is this awww? The owner put the dog in there and the dog wants out.
Not aww at all :(
Hes still there.
You're spinning it off screen
Poor thing is on the verge of panic.
You’re laughing, the puppy is trapped on what is the equivalent of a cyclical hell and you’re laughing
It's all fun and games until he pees in there.
Why the fuck are you filming, help the poor guy out!
*...sigh, ...this is my life now...*
r/donthelpjustfilm
He's having a ruff time.
owner is obviously spinning the rack. still cute tho.
Some ones spinning the bottom
Someone out of frame/at the bottom is turning the thing.
Being picked up by your owner and placed onto a lazy Susan in the cupboard and then said owner twisting the lazy Susan round and round so you can't get out?
How is it "aww" to put the puppy in there for upvotes and views?
Help him! :( lol
Get it out of there..😞
Legend has it, he is still in the cabinet to this day.
How long can he go like this?
I can watch this all day😂😂❤️
Hmm I wonder why we can't see the lower shelf...

Edit: not to mention this is not how physics work.
That is so mean! That puppy did not get in there on his/her own!
Hilarious. Especially considering there's someone at the bottom keeping the thing spinning. Anything for views right?
Am I the only one who doesn't find this cute? The dog looks worried.
Oh no!!
So basically, he very smol.
Get it out of there 😞
I totally understand where everyone is coming from saying things like "poor puppy" and "this is bullying", but this is just a classic harmless prank and it's funny. I doubt the pup was there for more than a few minutes, and I'm sure he was spoiled vigorously right after.
Poor pooch.
Would have been better if he was powering a tiny revolving cake stand.
 That’s how I feel at work some days. A lot of effort and not getting anywhere...
Finally a good visual representation for my life.
This is his life now
Must escape the gulag
Wait how does that work. Is there some kind of motor under it?
Did she ever get out?!
aww got stuck
Puppy treadmill!
Are there circular treadmills for dogs?  Getting off would be tricky
Discount treadmill. Nice!
“Captain Cabinets,
Trapped in Cabinets
Can he get out,
will he get out,
'Cause he will.”
My how the turnstable.
This is me. I relate to this dog super hard.
Nothing lazy about this, that looks like work!
If he stopped fighting, he could ride his momentum around and get out. Almost happens at one point.
I’m judging you for maxwell coffee, that shit is garbage.
Not so lazy anymore, are you Susan?!
Save the puppy ffs
I’ve always wanted one of those in my house.
i love this shit direct inject it into my veins pleeeeease
hope he doesn't pee or poop...that would be one hell of a ride
Spin me Right Round like a Record Baby
Hotel California
Legend says, the creature never escaped its prison... an era of binding would foresee this being’s future...
I struggle to find the mistake here
To this day he is still there
Good thing is he is not giving up
Legend has it he's still walking around
I took the blame
“Dormammu, I’ve come to bargain”
At least he got to eat everything on that shelf first!
Love the music lol
Too cute
No treadmill, those weird things you called weird names will work haha
Hairy-Go-Round
That dog getting a better exercise  than me.
HELP IT!
Awww man !!
I’m in training for using a treadmill when I get older.
this poor woolen puppy.
Awwww
This is a lot better than meatspin.
This is so unsatisfying, I wanted to see him leap out.
Jane, get me off this crazy thing!
Make it stop! I said, make it stop!! Now!!
I kept waiting for him to come out! This was r/mildlyinfuriating honestly
Sometimes you are the dog and sometimes you are the wheel
I don't understand.  How can it continuously spin if the dog isn't pushing against something else
So much light just came into my life
Did he make it out?
Good exercise Mr.
Wait till he's 60 pounds and still demanding to use the treadmill!
perfect metaphor for my life.
One of the few times music being added to one of these videos is actually fitting
Spins more rhymes than a lazy Susan, and he’s innocent until his guilt is proven
Ah Newtonian physics... puppo’s greatest enemy
It's funny right up until he takes a puppy dump in there
Not so lazy now.
Great way to walk your dog
The drawer is designed very intelligently ... looking at the lovely dog
Legend has it the puppy is still stuck in that lazy Susan to this day.
Like a punishment given by the gods.
Way better than meatspin
im waiting for his cry for help.. lmao
“Is your puppy too fluffy! Well I have the perfect product, just for you!!!!”
Replace this with aliens watching humans on earth
Hims are trying so hard. Gotta get that workout in!
This is my life now
This song will never be the same since meatspin.
Rumor has it, the puppy Is still there, always one step away from the pets
Adorable
I can’t help but think the owner is turning the lazy Susan from the bottom shelf off camera.

I don’t think this would move like that if the little guy was walking on it.
Now you want to go out for a walk? I'm ready for nap! What a circle jerk!
Time keeps on *spinning spinning spinning* into the future.
that lazy Susan is not properly leveled.
There's a blueprint for a cute diy dishwasher
Save yo damn dog!
Honey.. it’s time to walk the dog..

Ok mom...
I was a mistake
And the family discovered a new way to generate electricity!! :)
Is this how you generate electricity?
Can someone put interstellar music over this
My dog tried to bring her blanky to the ravine yesterday and she looked so sad that I was saying no so I let her bring it in the car lol
I don't see any mistakes !
perpuptual motion machine
But I want that way
Cutest thing I've seen in a while.
*”Jane stop this crazy thing!”*
Holy cow where was this filmed? Looks exactly like my old house.
Lazy my eye!
The song choice really is the cherry on top of this video
I've seen this before but I'll watch it and upvote every time.
I have never felt so warm and fuzzy
Well now you know how to exercise him on a rainy day
That pup deserves an awesome treat. Poor confused pup.
Spinning with his hand up!
He just needs to run then completely stop, and scooch out at the right time. The little fella doesn’t know that though....
anyone know if this pup is a lab or golden?
Doggo gainz
Canine hamster wheel.
*record scratch, followed by freeze frame* you might be wondering how I got here
Attach a battery to it then and make it generate power. Then u can put your puppy on it and power your TV whit it. Puppy gets exercise you get to watch tv. Remember to let the puppy of the thing sometimes.
Connect a transformer to the thing and you will be able to harvest the puppy energy for electricity.
Cute puppy + meatspin flashbacks = weird feelings.
Just go the other way, duh
Sweet
My first thought was, "Why doesn't that puppy just wait for the spinning platform to carry him back around?" Then I realized that I'm a moron.
Is this dog labor for energy?
That looks like my cabin
Welcome to purgatory, little one.
Silly dog, just walk the other way.
Moving forward, just call me, Lazy Susanne
Is he still spinning? I hope not
What do some people say?
SOME MURDERS were made.
Who do they think I am - Eddie?
I feel like this is a video of my life right now
Poor baby!
I'll admit to laughing, and it's super cute!
Genuine question: how would the dog get out of that?
Man I hate puppy mills.
Awwwww
This is absolutely adorable. (S)he created his/her item treadmill.... how smart!
I would give up my life for this pupper.
New puppy treadmill
The not so lazy susan
Wait till he figures out how to speed it up
so cute
Which song is this?
I definitely have nightmares like this
Heck.
“Sometimes you gotta take a step back”
Puppy treadmill!
Awh, goldies are a bit thick.
Legends say that he is still walking
Some say he’s still trying to get out...
What sorcery is this?
One upside is he is getting exercise.
Never EVER use this song with a puppy in the video. Why?
he's just getting his steps in.
But...but...how is this happening?
OH LOOK AT THE BUDDY
Aww Cute Doggo
Homemade exerciser
Powering the house
Legend has it that he is still spinning around
Built in puppy walker

HUMAN, HAAALP ME
There is definitely someone out of frame spinning this thing from the bottom. Physics don’t work like that, homie.
Did he ever get off?
“I’m having a ruff day, but I’m trying to stay pawsitive ”
The "mistake" was made when the owner put a puppy on a lazy susan in order to get internet points.
Aww! But also, I never thought of putting a lazy susan in there. That's pretty cool. No squinting and reaching all the way at the back for stuff lol
HELP HIM.
Oh no he's trapped forever
"Moooommm, heeelllppp!"
Someone let the poor dog out!
It is like Conan pushing the wheel of pain.
He’s trying his best and that’s okay
He looks like hes had enough of this shit already.
Interesting option for a puppy treadmill...
soo cute
Pupetual motion machine!
Omg! Help that poor baby!
Oh dog, oh Dog, OH DOG. AM I TRAPPED HOW DO I GET OUT JUST KEEP WALKING
How did that hamster go so fast?
My life in a nutshell...
Someone is clearly spinning the bottom ring...
Puppy hamster wheel
Once the puppy grows larger, it will be sad that it can't fit in there anymore
Nice addition of oingo boingo, lol
Awww?  Poor little thing!
That is one sweet super susan!   Excited to be getting one for the first time installed in a few weekss.  I will post it when my cats go round, I can already see it.
My brain ruminating about the awkward thing I said to a complete stranger
hahaha
Wasn't this posted the other day? Yawn
at least he's gettin his steps in
This is how I feel in meetings.
Wish our lazy susan thing spun that easy.
Legends say he's still at it...
Omg that song was on the radio when I hit the sound button to hear what was going on...they weren't in sync, but what a coinkydink!
Who’s a good boy?
this why I don't eat just any odinson food
Puppy treadmill
I don’t see any mistakes with that cutie
“I can’t get off the carousel”.
Me on the path of life.
Hearing this song, THAT website jumped into my mind.

Thank you mid 2000's internet.
Is this the puppy mill I heard so much  bad things about?
"This is not a game!! I want my treats! Why they move :("
.....so close....yet so far....
My life perfectly described in 20 sec
This is now my worst nightmare
Guess what song I'm going to be have going round my head for the next few days!!!! Aaarrgghhh. Cute dog though. 

Haha just realised what I wrote and made myself laugh. Oh dear it's obviously time for bed if I laughing at my own stuff!!!! Night all. Nose bupp to puppy dog.
Oh my goodness I love it so much
I’m thinking we may have an alternate power source here.
I am crying now from laughing so hard.
😅😹😅😅
so I just recently got a baby Savannah Kitten from a lady I met on Instagram. My kittie is just so cute. So I thought I’d recommend her for anyone in need. She’s legit trust me. Her contact shld be “plus one, six one nine, eight four one, ten nine eight”. I’m so happy she just made my day.
Her Instagram is “f1f2savannahkittens”
I could only focus on the fact that you don’t use your appliance cabinet for appliances.
DOOR STUCK!!!
repost
And thus he spent the rest of his life in that loop
He'll have nightmares about it
Sweet pup Vs physics!
I gather the only mistake made was thinking people on Reddit would believe the puppy got in there by itself?
God damnit Susan!
wow, he's so cute! Love it💕
Need an interstellar remix.
Trapped by evil sorcery!
Dude...help the poor pup instead of recording.
Good exercise for a day if its crazy outside
Aw come on someone is doing this to him it's obvious for multiple reasons, and it may look cute but it's not nice.

That is what my parents said when I was born
He just wants out :(
Did you put the dog in there? Did the dog get out on its own or did he/she need help?
this is what anxiety looks like
Meatspin. Ugh.
u/Ysghost1
Of course there's someone spinning it lol. How would the puppy spin the wheel while having it's entire body on it? That'd be like standing inside a boat an expecting to be able to push it forward by walking backward. There's nothing to exert force on. If the wheel wasn't being powered externally, the doggo would just walk right off it.
I feel so bad for him, at the same time as I can't stop watching because it's too adorable!
That's what nightmares are made of...
Someone help him :(
Ffs let him out please
