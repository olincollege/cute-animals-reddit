924 days is way too long but I’m so so happy for this child!
[removed]
Oh my gracious. I love that smile. I’m so happy for him and his new family.
I mean... I'm really happy for the kid on the right but poor guy on the left man.
Who is pimping this kid for likes ?
I think this photo has been circulating for years. But it’s still heartwarming.
I love that toothless grin!
Unpopular opinion: these kinds of photos are cute and heartwarming but I also always feel a twinge of....well, the poor kid didn’t get a say in any of it and is now just smiling and providing a photo op for the parents, makes it feel like the kid is a prop so the parents can feel good about themselves.
I'm happy for the occasion but was it really necessary to put his picture on social media?
I'm sure it's a good sign that your new parents are making you hold two signs for social media the first day they get you
I am so happy for him and his family, but this is why I hate social media. This baby doesn't need his life blasted online. If children can't give consent to contracts before 18, you shouldn't be publicly documenting their life. They cannot give consent to be filmed and published for the benefit of their parents. It's upsetting and denies the rights of the children involved. Again, I am so happy for him and his family. God bless you all. Blessed be.
As an adoptive parent, you love to see it.
Honey lets go adopt our son.

Oh wait, I almost forgot our social media sign cards!

\_\_\_

Excuse me Sir, I'd like to adopt 2k likes on twitter, which child would you recomend?
[removed]
Aww, his little face!
Yeah let's flex our adopted child, we are really good people guys look
[deleted]
[removed]
I'm sure it's considered as a controversial political opinion nowadays but please prioritize adoption over biological kids, they need families and you don't contribute to further overpopulating this world. Give them a chance!
Your new family is so lucky to have such a sweet son.I hope you all have an amazing life together!❤️
Must be a lot of pollen in the air today. My eyes are watering up a bit.
This repost is so fucking old that kid has probably graduated high school by now.
And immediately whored out for parents social media.....
Nice handwriting for a 3 year old.
[removed]
Did the adopting parents come up with that picture idea? If so, don't let them take before lecturing them for a good 40 hours that this kid is not a social media trophy.
“Before we adopt you, let’s get those reddit upvotes before we say no”
Plebbitors will do fucking anything for fake woke internet points.
Yeah to bad this is a repost and your age on r/teenagers is 14
Edit: his entire account is just a karma farm good luck with the 15 dogs
Why make your child pose like that for 15 minutes of internet fame? It’s frankly a little dehumanizing.
It I could just give more up arrows
Man I cannot wait till me and my wife can bring home a beautiful child like him.
We really want to adopt and are working to get financial set and classes and we should be able to bring home a little boy or girl like him. I would absolutely love to give a child/children a good loving home.
People who adopt & foster kids are a special bunch.
Parent: Hey, sweetie. Just hold that sign up real quick so your new parents can get internet points.
This is so old.  The kid is probably in college by now.
"Hey before we leave I want you to hold these signs in front of you so I can get a lot of internet points. You'll understand when you grow up kid now do as I say or no adoption for you"
[removed]
First day of adoption and already posing for reddit holding signs. How about a fucking cake instead of showing him to random strangers on internet , what is this supposed to mean anyway, day 924 in foster care, is this supposed to add value or something ?

Fucking twisted people.
Heck yeah! Close to three years. That's great.
I'm happy for the kid ☺️
[removed]
He looks so damn happy. This is pretty cool.
Look at his little smile 😭 he’s so cute
Crap thought they were twins but it is just ONE child ... my apologies 💙 it does not change my sentiment one bit
His smile!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
So happy for him, he’s a cutie!
Hugs, hugs and more hugs.
OMG!!!! This made my day!!!  Love this little guy! Bless you all!❤️🙏
What a darling. Wishing this little boy every happiness with his new family.
Look at his little smile!
So sweet to see him so happy!  Thanks to whomever you are for loving someone unconditionally and reminding us how important it is to remember the pure of heart ❤.
Aww, this is so cute! So happy for the little guy :)
He's adorable!!
❤❤❤❤
Love this!
I'm so happy for you!
Its sad how many kids need a home, compared to how hard and expensive it is just to adopt one of those kids to good people.
Congratulations to you and your family. I was in foster care for only 45 days form the day I was born until I was adopted. A measly amount compared to you. A life changing experience.
I thought he had a twin at first. Then i looked closer.
What a handsome young man with a brilliant smile 😊
If i never end up married or with any kids.. Im going to try adopting a foster kid. Just to give em a good home and a good life while I am allowed.. I make enough money.. But I'll probably wait till I hit 40 for that...
May you continue to be as happy as you are today 🤗🎉🎈❤️👍❤️❤️❤️
Keep us posted
LOOK AT THAT SMILE
I wish this angel all the best in life❤️
How was this little cutie pie not adopted sooner?  Hes super adorable. 😍😍😍😍😍
3yrs :(
What a BEAUTIFUL little boy!!! I hope his parents are going to love him and respect him and encourage individuality.
What a sweet little guy! My husband was in foster care and he still calls his foster parents mum and dad an talks to them twice a week. They were our witnesses and only attendees other then my husband and I and the jp at our wedding. :) This picture makes my heart sing :)
From an old adopted kid, now technically an adult  -

CONGRATULATIONS! Awesome, little dude. Hugs and happies!
Omg.. LOOK AT THE UNFILTERED JOY ON HIS SWEET LITTLE FACE
❤️❤️❤️
not to be dramatic or anything but i would die for this little boy and his smile
weird that his twin is rubbing it in.
Everybody liked that.

I have friends going through adoption process.
It’s a super cute photo! 
But it always concerns me when parents have their kids pose with signs

This [story](https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2018/03/the_story_behind_devonte_harts.html) made me realize that parents that have their kids hold up signs like this can be ... concerning.
Think about the fact that whoever adopted him made him hold both of those pictures and smile for the photo, presumably for internet points.
I alsways find it weird when they have kids pose with signs like this.
Awww 💕🎉🥳 You Go little dude ❣️ Great Smile 🥰
My wife and I adopted our son several years ago when he was just 18 months. It took us a little over 2 years to adopt him. He is just starting 6th grade now. Could not ask for a better kid to call my son. My parent s also adopted his 2 biological sisters which seems strange when i talk to people but it works for us. We also just 3 years ago fostered a little girl who was born premature. We were lucky enough to be able to adopt her last thanksgiving. Those 2 days are to me the best days of my life. The adoption process can be an emotional rollercoaster as you are in the dark with alot of things while you try and raise the children yourself. It does help when you get a good social worker on your case also. We had both good and bad ones. There is also a lot of turnover in that field as they have to put up with alot and they seem not to comunicate with each other very well. I would still recomend someone to try to foster kids if they can. There is such a need and it is really rewarding.
Congrats!!!! My two foster kids that I adopted were in foster care just shy of 700 days before their adoption went through!!!! 🎉
That kid has good handwriting!! Better than me
What a handsome little guy!! This made my eyes tear up with happiness.
Beautiful day for a beautiful kid, and I hope he has a beautiful life!  
  
and the green pants are slammin'!
Goddamn, I don't want kids, but if that little fella smiled at me and said, "I am a foster child" little guy would be coming home with me so fast!

Hopefully legally, but either way...
Stuff like this makes me so sad and happy at the same time. Sad to know that so many children are in the system but happy that some do find a good family and a home. I wish all these kids can find a home.
LOOK AT HIS LITTLE SMILE WITH HIS MISSING TEETH I CANT
Omg i love missing teeth smiles!

ETA: On kids.
r/mademesmile
This is great but stop making kids hold signs for internet points
That's great that he's been adopted, but using his horrible situation of being parentless for close to 3 years for internet points is a little fucked up...
All I can think of is, this kid meeting his forever parents for the first time and they hand him these signs to hold for pictures
Yay lets teach kids that every big moment needs to be leveraged for fake internet points!
Anyone find it weird that the first thing you do when you adopt a child is make a sign and then make them hold it and post it on social media?
Awwwww, congratulations little buddy and may your life be rich with much love and prosperity!
He will go on to go to Harvard I can tell 👊🏻👊🏻
Happy gotcha day kiddo!!! Two and a half years is a looooong time for a guy his age.
I am very happy for the Child, but why does he have to hold up this sign? 

I fucking hate this social Media trend, when parents force(yes, force) to hold a sign Just for some recognition on social Media.
And soon he will own a chain of Los Pollos Hermanos restaurants.
That is a long time.
Although I love this beautiful African American boy (so beautiful! ❤️♥️♥️), I am just so sad he'll face systemic racism and a brutalized Fascist police force. He must fight early. Fight little one, fight.
That's cringe... Using the kid as their validation token. Y-I-K-E-S
Yay!!!!
I can't see having a small child hold a white sign on the internet go wrong in any way...
Damn, Gaetz really is quick with it



(Just a joke. This is actually so wholesome I fucking love it)
Don’t think I smiled that much in a long longggggg time 


Thanks for this op
All I can imagine is the new parents getting the kid to hold up these signs and taking pictures think aw yeah I can't wait to get this sweet karma than backing out.  Either way it seems like something that is only done for online clout.
[deleted]
This is great but did the adopting parents make him hold these signs for a social media post? Posting up pics of your child on social media as the first thing you do doesn't sit well with me and just feels like they want to use him
Congratulations little man!!!
Bruh using a child's adoption for internet points lmao what
I can’t wait to be a foster parent!!
Congratulations! That’s awesome:)
So adorable!
Aww 😊 how sweet
So happy for the little cutie!
So happy for y’all!

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations on being adopted little man, you are worthy of a great life. Enjoy
He's stylin in his green pants and his loafers. That smile tho. Good for the kid. Good on the adoptive parents. How the fuck did it take 924 days for him to be adopted!?
how the hell was he not adopted in the first 2 weeks, thats the most adorable kid ive ever seen
Had a first grade student who was adopted during the school year.  We had a big “just adopted” party for her at school and it was wonderful. Not a dry eye among any of the teachers.
I always thought these kinds of pictures were weird. I’m happy for the kid but I doubt this was his idea... idk
Stop by circulating photos of children online for fake internet clout.
The weird/sad part about this is that there is an adult who said "oh wow, 924 days? That should give me some internet cred and make me feel good about myself" 

Good for the kid really. I just hope the parent loves them beyond the "I'm a good person" high.
Imagion being in foster care for that time and the first thing your new family does is make you hold up a sign for internet points
Photos like this make me so hyped about adopting in the future, can't wait until I'm ready
Foster care sucks. When they aren’t your real parents it’s hard to be treated as good as your actual child. So happy for him.
This fills my heart with all the good things(:
Please, take my upvote. 


NO, I AM. NOT CRYING!!!



Ok, only a little.  


A lot.
*about to go to a solid home for the first time in years*
wait, we gotta get a photo
Congratulations 👏💙👍💙. Wishing you and your family many, many joyous years.🙏💚🙏💚
My mom was raised in foster care her mom just dropped her off never came back . She made lemonade with the lemons but this story touches me to belong it just means so much 😀
Brings a smile to my face
Best of luck buddy!
His missing teeth are delightfully symmetrical.
Good luck little man!  God be with you, all of your days.
That’s not how long this little angel has been alive? My math is off right now, pls halp
This makes me so happy!
His happy face just lifted my heart
Today is the first day of the rest of your life little man! Congrats! 🥰
He is sooooo adorable what a smile and those glasses omg I wish him all the best with his new fam this made me smile
Gosh I hate that a child so young has to be in foster care that long. I guess he could have had the same foster parents during that time but my mind just takes me to bouncing around from home to home. I hope he has a happy life! Such a cutie!
I like potato chips
Nice
R E S P E C T!!!! You were put on this planet for a greater good (this boy) and he will join you in your journey. God Bless!
#Hooray for You!!!
He's going to be a dentist.
Congrats little man! Makes you thankful for family.

^(The onion cutting is real)
What a precious baby!
What a wonderful little guy. So happy for him :)
His smile is so cute it hurts
This just made my day, you'll now get the love you deserve.
Tell the short bus to save a seat, jesus.
I love this post!!!
I just want to get my career on so I can adopt already 😩
Getting adopted is literally not a thing you love...

But for 924 days... I understand that my boy !
his smile is just the cutest!
I love this. Way better system now... I was in for 14 years of and on until age 5 then full time orphan from then on
What a beautiful smile, I’m happy for him too!   And his parents!
That smile..❤️
Good for you, little dude!
Why would they adopt just one of the twins?
I'm not crying. Youre crying. 

Thanks. I needed a happy thing today.
oh yeah good luck little guy
I cant even imagine how stoked he was to finally be apart of a family!
Yay for adoptions, he looks so happy!
Heard in a reportage that in the USA, parents of adopted children are allowed to send them back to the orphenage if they don't want the kid anymore.
That's beautiful!! Kisses to that wonderful child 😘
I love this. I'm pregnant with my first but were considering adopting our second!
I can't imagine what being a foster child is like.... Just always wondering when you get that family.
Lucky kid!
I hope you have a long happy life
Using days instead of years just sounds so much sadder
He has amazing handwriting for such a young kid
Bless their hearts.  A new family begins its journey together.  I’m very happy for you guys.  Congratulations!
This little guy is so important and that smile is a heart melter. A little of my faith in humanity has been restored and I needed that.
How sweet!
What a beautiful sweet young man. 🤗 Congratulations to all of you. What a wonderful day.  🎈🎂
924 days makes me really sad
This makes me happy, but breaks my heart he was in foster care for so long
Beautiful.
Oh i wish for him the best i liked his smile <3
Aw congrats little man. And nice pants!
Ugh that big smile with the missing teeth. Sweet baby angel. So happy for him!
And he lived happily ever after
Good lad!
That smile. Proper awww shit right here
Great news. Enjoy your future.
Heres to hoping you have an amazing life!!
Beyond happy for the little guy.  I needed to see this today.  Thank you.
Ugh.

I need to get my shit together so I can be a foster mom.
:)
:)
Posts like this make my day ❤

Bittersweet image.
*Everybody Liked That*

 I don’t want kids of my own but would be so happy to adopt! I hope my future husband understands this!
Rock on, little man
Too cute! Hope his life is full of smiles
How old is he? 924 days is more than two years
r/mademesmile
30 years old and was adopted at the age of 3. I have the most amazing life thanks to Mom and Dad.
He is SO precious. Bless him and his family.
Everybody is
What a happy day for him!
Awesome.
I’m in the process of getting my home inspected so we can foster our first (hopefully) baby.
Families Matter.
This is so AWESOME! Two of my best friends are currently fostering a wonderful little girl that we’ve all become really attached to and I really hope that this ends up being their eventual happy ending and now I’m crying...
❤️❤️❤️
These pics always make me weepy.  What a cutie!
i am too
I’m ecstatic for him. He looks so enthused for a new home and family. Thank you and bless you and your family
Aww, that is awesome! I love this!!
Need updates
Amazing!!!!
We should be ashamed of how long we leave children in foster care.
he so cute
Im a foster kid got adopted when i was 2 and after all that work from my parents im depressed sometimes hope this kid does better
Dude this made me to emotional. I am so happy for Lil guy.
Happy for him? I'm happy for those parents. Look at that fuckin smile.
Look at his teeth!! So cute!
Hope his new parents are awesome!
YAAAAAAAAAY!  God bless you.  this makes my day!
I'm so glad someone kind and amazing adopt him, 924 days is **Waaaaay** to long
...was he taken at birth? That's almost 3 years. How old is he?
Awesome!! Every kid needs a home.
Awww
This just put the biggest smile on my face (after an otherwise not-great day). Thank you. I hope you live a long, happy, productive, fun, and fulfilling life with your new family. Be well little friend and come back every once-in-a-while and tell about your adventures!
Good for you!! I wish you a long happy life with your new family young man!
Praying for him!
lmao this is so deshumanizing to make him hold a sign like he was some kind of pet or something
Cute little boy. I hope he finds much happiness with his new family.
Omgggg so
Much heart
This pic is so old that the kid is probably an adult
900 days? Is that all? He got lucky.
I wish all the kids in the world never knew what it's like - not to have parents 🤧
Congrats lil bud
What a happy little boy
  Here is hoping his life is a fulfilling one
Congrats lil man!!
Look at that sweet baby boy! Why the hell was he in foster care so long?!
🥳congratulations ❤
GOOD FOR THIS LITTLE MAN!!!
How sweet I could use something not evil in my day
YEY! I hope he has a good life!
Yes! So happy for you hun!!!!! What a blessed moment.
5,110 days
I am so happy for him 😍👍😍
I was in foster care from age 3-10 (17 different homes) which is when I was adopted. Unfortunately my adoptive mother changed the way she treated me as soon as I became a teenager. I only wanted a loving family.
My dumb ass thought this was twins.
Damn is it Thursday already? This repost is scheduled for like every Thursday right?
His smile just gets me
That smile!!!! I am in tears I am so happy for him!
He can't even read tho
Hope he is 👌🏻
What a cutie pie 🥰 made my day ! Thanks for sharing .
Hey let’s adopt this kid but make him hold up a sign we we get internet points
This kid is so cute that I can only imagine that he was not immediately available for adoption.
Yay! That's all I can say. This stuff makes me so happy.
Sup buddy!
Such a sweet moment
Everybody loved that
Omg this is too adorable 😍
Yay
Made my heart smile.
He’s adorable!
He's adorable with his front teeth missing and that great big smile! I hope he has wonderful parents or parent that will love and adore him.
THAT SMILE! so happy for him and his family!!
so wholesome🥰
Man, what a sweet little kid. I've always wanted to adopt, just to help out other human beings.
Lovely boy...may he be happy with his family
Yay!! What a sweet face, so happy for him!!
This kid looks 8 and 80 at the same time. I don't mean that in a bad way, it's freaking adorable.
Such a blessing.  I’m so happy for him.  Such a love.  ❤️❤️❤️
Congratulations little man I wish you the best!
He's got really cool pants
My HEART. So happy for this little guy.
Congratulations!  I wish your family the very best.  Adopted my daughter after 11 years and 11 months in foster care.  We are so glad to be out.
As a person who works in the foster care system, this kinda thing brings me a lot of joy. I wish it happened more often...
Adorable. I was in foster care for 3 months. I have no memories of my real parents. Catholic Social Services, for what it's worth. I've met kids who've never made it out of the system. Some were okay, some were... not.
That's almost 3 years. That has to be half of this little guy's life. 

I'm so glad he finally got his family.
Boy, is he cute ! And with his little glasses on, he looks like he’ll be a little genius in school.
This made my day.
It's baby Urkel!!!!
Yay
❤️❤️❤️
I’m just gonna say yes, yes, yes!!
Oh gosh I’m crying
It's all up from here my fellow man!
Yay!!!
That's the sweetest smile I've seen all day
Im sad to say I got a chance..
Is it expensive to adopt a child?
Good for him. I hope he has a loving home. I was in foster care till I was 11 it's not a fun time.
Is that his handwriting?
It took me too long to realize this wasn’t a before and after
..this boutta make me fuckin cry.
Foster parent here, I'm about to reunify my second foster child with family next week.I'm happy for them, but there's definitely a part of me that wishes I was adopting him.
Oh man i cried instantly
That's badass keep your head up high little man and shine on!
I wanna make this my tinder pic. Dude is too pretty to ignore for 924 days.
Damn that kid is adorable
This is amazing. I'm happy for you! Finally something to smile about!
Somthing tells me this image is from somwhere else
I really want to adopt a kid. Both of our parents were special education workers and fostered as well, so we know how best to provide for these kids. My partner definitely can't have kids and my ability is questionable as best. But we're also considered an LGBT couple.
🥳❣️💕 AWESOME 🥳
making a child hold a sign for online points basically sucks the aww out of my mouth
Great Smile too 😊
I needed to see this today. Happy for this little guy.
His little smile 😍😭
Yay!! That’s so awesome!!!! ❤️
My heart🥺
As a foster parents in hopes of adopting; the struggle is real.  Congratulations to the little man and his family!  I love his smile.
Omg he is so freaking cute.
That's so damn cute!
Sweet little boy, I don't know what his story is but I'm overjoyed he's been adopted!
SO HAPPY
What a cutie.
He's fucking adorable
Kinda want green pants now
As an adoptive dad, I looked upon the little bloke with a tear. I really hope Life turns out great for him!
So cute~
And now my new parents are exploiting me for likes!
May your future life be happy every day
Not fair to make him carry that imo. But, hey, man's got a wide smile on his face. Happy for him.
This is heart warming I’m so happy for the kid
Look how happy he is. Happy for him!!
Everyone liked that!
Congrats Lil Dude! <3
I call tell he’s going to make it so big his that his birth family’s gonna regret it. 
So happy for him.🥰
I’ve always wanted to be a foster parent but I’m legitimately scared. It seems SO rewarding though. I hope one day I can get there.
this is what beauty looks y
Aww he’s adorable <3
He's a cutie patootie.
Amazing, so happy!
Pooor lil dude... 900 days.  Hope he makes his new parents proud
Im happy for him
As someone who grew up in foster care I wasn't adopted for nearly 5 years it made me feel unwanted and it hurt to this day it's had a huge impact on my life.
He is just the cutest!!!
We’ve had a little girl with us for almost a year now. We really hope she can be part of our family. She’s out fifth placement. We adopted our first and our son and he is such a joy
Awww he is so cute!
That's literally his entire life tho lmao
Damn that one caught me right in the feels.
Nice
Wow my heart. He’s so freakin cute 🥰 please take good care of each other.
This is simply amazing!
Wow. How awesome to know that you are chosen..what a special young man. I commend the family for recognizing the importance of spreading love.
<3 Congrats little one!!! <3
May the good Lord bless him and his family. An adorable little boy whose happiness and joy are shining through. I love it.
I been adopted twice, I love my parents. This dude looks like an amazing child.
Yay!! :)

Edit: I impulse wrote my reply but realize it might come off not as intended. Anyways, really happy for this fella and hope he has a bright future ahead.
Happy for this guy. Can’t even imagine what he’s been through.
So cute! Hes so happy!
Couldn’t agree more. So happy for that ADORABLE little guy, and for his new parents. As a man whose wife was adopted when she was a child, I sincerely hope that EVERY child is adopted. They all deserve to grow up in a supportive, loving home. No exceptions, no children left behind. 👍
Wow his handwriting is impressive!!
924 days = 2 years + 6 months + 2 weeks
Has this subforum seriously devolved into posting random pictures of humans now? There has to be vote manipulation going on, surely.
I’m so happy for you❤️ My boyfriends brother wasn’t able to get adopted for almost four years even though he was in the same house from the time he was born
You are the best! Share your smile and enjoy your life with all that see your shining face!! You are GREAT!
So, so sweet! Big time congrats to him.
Wow that's awesome,so happy for you ❤️❤️
Those twins are adorable
Awwwwwwwwwwww
hes adorable and im happy
Currently fostering-to-adopt right now. We’ve had him since he was 4 days old. He’ll be 6 months old on the 9th... such a blessing to have him in our life. We’ve tried to get pregnant for years, but my wife has Cystic Fibrosis and it complicates her getting pregnant... so happy to see this post!! Stay safe everyone!!
love❤️❤️
I swear to God this picture is at least 5-6 years old.
Happy for this little dude he looks stoked
What lucky parents they will be, to have someone so PRECIOUS...❤
That brave boy looks like the granny in the nutty professor movie. Hope he stay happy for years to come.
I adopted my three kids from foster care 15 years ago this September!!
Handsome young man. Great news!
yay. excellent buddy. have a great life!
So tiny and gorgeous
Hopefully now he can have teeth
Cause he’s the super cutest! ❤️❤️❤️
Good work, we need good people to help children. And less bad people having them not saying that’s the case here......
That’s 924 days too long ! Poor little guy ! That must have been so hard . I’m so glad he found a loving home .
I see nothing wrong with posting his picture with the caption. 

This will encourage other people to adopt and put it in their heads that it's a real possibility for their family. 

I think there should be more happy pictures of kids that have been adopted so it may put the idea in people's heads. 

The more we talk about adoption, the better. Not enough kids are adopted and many are still waiting in Foster care.
did the foster parents write that sign and have him hold it so they can post it for efame? lmao
Little bastard is wearing black face!
I’m very happy for the little guy.  There’s nothing better than finding “home”.

My wife and I had our two adopted kids for 1016 days in foster care before being able to adopt them.  It was definitely the hardest, best thing we’ve ever done.
Lil man going to make something of himself
Good luck little man - I’m pulling for you.
The fact that I was waiting for a meme to pop up is living proof that I am going to hell
I'm glad for the boy and his family. I just don't see the point of underscoring that he was fostered. I don't think this is something I'd want to emphasize with my son - it's mostly for the parents (a self-pat on the back and yes, they deserve one, just maybe not so blatant as having the kid hold up an actual sign). Maybe it encourages adopting a foster child, but I doubt it.
That smile he has is everything 🥰🥰🥰
Congratulations little dude!  Man look at the smile. Got me over here cheesing like an idiot.
Good for him. I love a happy ending.
Wow this made my day
Stuff like this makes me want to cry. I am happy that he has a happy future ahead of him.
I wish it wasn’t so expensive to adopt I want another little peanut
This is a sweet and positive story. That beautiful smile made my day. 💕
Does anyone here watch on YouTube White Underbelly? I worry this is a feel good farce
This is so beautiful 😍
OH! Happy Gotcha Day!!!! 

what a smiling sweetheart!!!
oh for fucks sake! this is it! I'm definitely adopting a kid.
Congrats to the happy family.
Im sad to say I really enjoy it
he was adopted again!? how cute
gf.me/u/x9vhzz
He looks so sweet
That smile ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
We are looking to adopt our kids, very excited!
Awesome!
More people who can provide a good, loving home to children in foster care should do it. I want to, but I want to be able to offer a second parent to the mix first.

If you can, please adopt a child. They need you.
Congratulations!
Awesome!
Hell yes! What a lucky family to being home a smile like that! Hoping this kid has the best life.
Good news! Hope he receives amazing care from his new family, and wish him luck in his life!
What a cutie
That kid looks like Urkel
There are few things more adorable than little kids in glasses.
Yay 😁 aww 😊
*high five* little guy🙂
And his smile says everything.
To think Stewart little robbed someone like him of a home.
God bless you, kid.
So happy for this little guy 😁!!!!
Welcome to the family! Now hold this sign up. Now hold this one up and smile bigger.
So happy for the little dude
I always love kids with goofy missing teeth smiles. They always look so happy and that makes me happy. This kid has a great smile.
This kid's got lots of potential to unlock!
You beautiful boy. Congratulations 😁
Look at that sweet smile! Such a precious, happy thing! 💖
What a cute kid!
Good luck, little man!
This has meme potential
You go buddy! Enjoy life with a family youll do awesome kiddo
Way to go little man!! Hope you have a beautiful life filled with love and laughter with your forever family!
I love this little guy...I would have adopted him too 💜
I’m not crying. YOU’RE crying.
Nice
I was in foster care for five years. I’m happy for this kid. Thanks for this
What a cutie!
when i originally saw this it was at 924 comments
Awesome. I'm so happy for him. It really calms me to know that there are still some people in this world.
He is so cute
What a sweet adorable!
Good luck lil buddy!
Yay!
Very happy for you young man. All the very best in the world for you
He is so cute! I wish I had guts to adopt a kid!
That little boys smile just made my day. That's so awesome and so happy for him!
He has better handwriting that. I'll ever have.
So cute and awesome!!!!!!
Sweet boy ❤️
Hell yeah bud!
Over 2 1/2 years is probably half of his life so far . I’m glad he has a new family.  It’s horrible that our country has let him wait so long.
Ohh that smile! ♥️
What a lad
Very cool! He looks so excited
B4 you go thinks CPS is o great... I'm a failure figure of the system.. if your a loving individual with a truly caring soul please find the space within yourself and your home to help these children.
he's really cute!
Absolutely precious!!!!!
cutie <3
Little Man!
This post made my heart very happy. Awwww
why did I struggle reading 924..
What a beautiful feeling that must be for everyone involved.
We need more of this in 2020
OMG HIS PRECIOUS SMILE :DDD
That beautiful child.  What a lucky family that has him.
Such a lovely smile on this fella.

I'm so happy for him!
I don’t wanna be that person... but I think the words were photoshopped onto the sign. You can see interference around the lettering.
I can hear him saying this with his teeth missing........

Good for the lil fella!!
This is so heckin’ *heartwarming!*
Hell ya!
So sad

His smile just brightened my day what a handsome lil man oh my gahd
Don’t post his face. He has the right for privacy, too.
Happy gotcha day!
His little glasses are adorable.
Wholesome if I’ve ever seen one 🥺
You fools! If you have only waited 76 more days you could have a nice and big number!. At least the number is a multiple of 2... What do you mean happiness is more important than cool looking numbers?!
this is the positivity i needed today
Just trying to figure out why I didn’t see the line straight down the middle and was like “I? They’re twins tho?” For a whole ten seconds
r/wholesomememes
I thought there were 2 kids and the other was just flexing :D
I was in care for 16 years! No adoption, but man, if this doesn’t make you smile, what a cutie.
Sooo wholesome
Congratulations Little dude! I’m so happy for you and your new family!! 

((BTW: The CUTEST smile!))
Shit. That's gotta be at least three weeks.
Congratulations!
That’s awesome!❤️
This made my day. So happy for everyone involved!
That's wonderful!
May they be good to him.
As an adoptee myself (at 6 months), I will never not feel like every other single adopted child is a kindred spirit to me!!!
Oh damn.. I don't even know that kid and I love him.
ez karma
IM NOT CRYING YOURE CRYING
More happy if he made the sign himself and not someone else made and made him hold. Lol
His spelling is commendable.
Congratulations beautiful little man 🥰
I feel like crying. So sad for so long, but very happy for him
Being someone that was adopted later in childhood that you for anyone that adopts.
This is amazing! So happy for this little dude!
Awwwwww he's so adorable!! <3
That bright smile is too wholesome (о´∀`о)
Awww.  Congratulations bud. Your parents are lucky people to adopt such a sweet boy. ♥️♥️♥️
Enjoy little man ... you deserve all the happiness in the world just like every child
Good morning and God bless you buddy!
Hey young man! That infectious toothless smile has spread and now I'm smiling. Congratulations be strong and spread joy and be happy throughout your new journey in life. 🤝
Yo kid can you hold this sign I made and smile for my internet worth?
Cute boy...hope he has good life ahead of him.
Cute little guy, I wish him all the best in his new family!
That is so wonderful.
the spreadable joy.
Have a good life little man. 
Also thank you for foster care !
This is great! Great day for him I love this!
I’m not the person who should reproduce. I’m not smart or strong. If I ever got married that would be my first thought to adopt. And the women I want to marry can’t reproduce. So that would work great but im to dumb to even marry her
Stuff like this makes life worth living
This is wonderful. Look at his face light up! I’m 33 and single and I think I always will be. I’ve considered adoption and this little guys smile is really persuading me to for sure do it. Much love little man!
How wonderful for you ❤ I'm so happy for you 😇
Aww poor thing
:’)
I’ve always been unsure if I ever wanted kids but have decided that if I do, it’ll be adoption. Giving a loving family home to a child that would have otherwise missed out means far more to me than replicating my genetics 😝
Cute little love! May you keep that smile forever!
There needs to be more willing people in this world to help foster children like him.
I was adopted at around the same age too, so grateful with what I’ve got :)
This is amazing you can see how pure the smile on the cute face is coming from the heart
I didn’t even check the subreddit it’s in and said “Awwww” out loud
The world is tough, but this little guy is much tougher! I'm happy for u :)
That smile is priceless 🥰
So glad he found a good home, no child should grow up in foster care.
Love!
Hi happy for him! I'm dad
May he receive kindness, education and love each day of his life!
Teef
I am so happy for him to ❤️
Excellent writing skills for his age! :D
And what a talented sweet child too with beautiful handwriting at such a young age! They got lucky adopting this little miracle!
Bless his little heart! I wish all of the kids in foster care would have this outcome with a wonderful, loving family.
Congratulations sweet boy. You deserve the very best life. <3
God I’m so used to seeing pets on this subreddit that my brain autocorrected care to cage and it was the biggest hol the fuck up moment I’ve ever had
How with so many people that want a small child was it possible for this little boy to spend o many days in foster care . Or was he likely fostered with the people who adopted him .
Props to Foster Parents too.  Sometimes these have a vibe that is like Foster Care is bad.   Some are but many are great and loving.
Ohhh they’re so adorable ... so happy for the adoption 💙💙💙💙💙
Yay! Have a great life buddy!
Have a wonderful and blessed life with your new family
🌈Awwwww!  I hope you have a happy and healthy life cutie💗😘 
I’m so happy for you!🥰
Good luck for the little fella. I wish all the best in the world for him.
Bless him.
What a cutie!
I'm very happy for that young man.
This is kinda old but still gets me every time.
Look at lil man’s smile! So freaking cute!
The world is happy for every Forster kid adopted!!!!!!
Look at that smile 🥰
Beautiful 😍😮 and Don't I feel so glad for him because you never know he could probably become a tremendous guy.

What happened to most of these kids parents? Are they usually dead by some accident or something? I'm curious.
Old pic
AWWW
Got any cheeeeeese?!
#YAY
Omg those glasses!!
Cutest kid ever
He is so cute with his little glasses
I wish i could give this a thousand upvotes
Beautiful kid.. That smile...
“...and all I got was this stupid sign!”
Cuteness Overload
That’s enough to make a grown man cry.
Sending positive energy and good vibrations to lil buddy. May God give him a happy and successful life. May his parents shower him with love.

He melts my heart, he looks so happy ❤️ I wish him a bright and happy future.
Congratulations big guy.
That is  ...   ABSOLUTELY 
FANTASTIC ❗️
May the Blessings of the Lord follow you All the Days of Your Life!!

Good for him
By some racist white people,  no doubt
So exciting!!! 😊
I love him!! ❤️
I hope the Stauffer family doesn’t even get the chance to adopt anyone else.
This is becoming more and more like r/pics
For some reason, I read "aborted"
You mean to say.. Sold?
Hopefully he doesn’t get returned.
I don't think this should be in r/aww.
[deleted]
Now he’s looting in the black lives matter protests
[deleted]
Ok good for you
Guys it’s little billy
Big PP

Yay, exploitation!
Watch him be raised by apathetic white folks whom he’ll hate some day regardless of what they do for him.

This is super old
Should have waited till 1000 days
He didn’t write that
Good to see he finally stopped looting/burning down retail stores. Hopefully this wild animal goes to a great home.
Later his parents died
[deleted]
95% of Reddit would have you believe he should’ve been killed. Those people are idiots. Don’t be like them.
“But wait! Before he goes.... well there’s this thing called karma?.... don’t worry about it just hold this sign!”
