If you haven't already sent this to them, you need to secretly get this printed off at least at 8x10 if not larger, frame it, and hang it on their wall without telling them.
Her name is Jade and [here's one](https://i.imgur.com/10mIjOw.jpg) where she looks less derpy

I don't want /u/The_Phantom_Fap 's contribution to go un-noticed, so [here's the edit he posted with lasers](http://i.imgur.com/NMC7xgL.jpg)

EDIT: now that this thread is finally dying if you want to see more dumb pictures of this cat, she's on IG @heyjadebutt. Be forewarned that nothing else will be as good as this photo. She has peaked
I can‚Äôt stop laughing picturing her with the left facial expression in a top hat and monocle like an old time-y villain
I love this so hard. The derpy half smile is totally what makes this photo.
[Needed some lasers.](http://i.imgur.com/NMC7xgL.jpg)
From "I dont think that was a fart" to "I am you supreme Lord ruler"
what did you feed her? she looks high af.
Solid lighting, what‚Äôs your setup?
Ahh this is awesome. Made me laugh. Haven‚Äôt slept properly in weeks rarely anything brings me joy now thank you op
How did you do this and could you do it for me?! My bfs cat not me lol
When are you free?
Okay, I have to know: how did you isolate the whiskers on the foreground layer so cleanly?
Nice! Hey real quick, what are these types of photos called? It‚Äôs a serious question. I can‚Äôt seem to describe it well enough for Google to return relevant results. Is it some type of superimposed thing?
If I send you my cat can you make one of these and send him back?
A majestic derp
You're an amazing friend
You‚Äôre the best kind of friend.
My favorite part of this post is finding more pictures in OP's comment replies
I was inspired by this post, and I decided to make my own. Here is my sweet girl, [Moose](https://imgur.com/gallery/tCpnL2c)
What are your rates?...
This is glorious. You have no idea how much I want this for my cat.
Haha, this makes me think of [this](https://s3.awkwardfamilyphotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/23155548/mike-5931_106480310282_722415282_2649468_5403074_n.jpg)
I would love one of these for my cat so I can frame and hang it lol
If you imagine the pics as two separate sith lords it‚Äôs pretty funny:

*Two there should be. No more, no less. One to embody power, the other to crave it.*
This is fucking amazing, i'm legit crying from laughing so much. Honestly needed this today, it's been a really shitty last couple of weeks but this completely made my night hahaha, thank you so much for this. I need pics like this of my cats
[https://i.imgur.com/IiWMUsF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/IiWMUsF.jpg)
Looks like a movie poster for a film starring a wisecracking feline.
Am I the only one who thinks that she looks like Teddy Roosevelt (on the right) ?
Not to be over dramatic but I would fucking die for Jade
Front: *are those muffins?*


Back: *I luuv me some muffins mmhm*
Real cat people say ‚Äúbabysitting my friend‚Äôs cat‚Äù instead of just ‚Äúcatsitting‚Äù
How magnificent!
I dig this and want one of my cat haha

Glorious
No joke...I think you‚Äôre friends with my best friend because this exact photo was just on her IG story this afternoon! Small. World.
That‚Äôs not even my cat but I want it framed and on my mantle
This is one of my favorite things on the internet.
Come over to my house!! Airbnb for free, just portraits of nine cats pls
This cat needs to be the new Drake meme.
You can come babysit my cats. I've got four. I want to see what you do with a family portrait.
I love those expressions!üòÇ
Behold my standddooo powaaah!!
Please babysit my cats!
Kinda reminds me of irritated Kermit the Frog

Top right kitty also looks like she‚Äôs about to impart some crucial old school philosophical wisdom on our protagonist
This is literally the best thing I have seen in my entire life.
Thanks for my new phone wallpaper!
This is now my phone wallpaper. Sorry not sorry.
This snarky-ass cat better be solving mysteries for his local bodega in cartoon form for our enjoyment.
Tell me the truth. The cat made you do this right?
This just made my day better, thank you friend
It's so high quality
I can hear it doing the *chk chk* sound he does in Fantastic Mr Fox
Is that cat running for political office? Any candidate with such a dignified portrait deserves my vote.

Holy hell this is the greatest thing I've seen all week.   I had to save this
Please babysit my cat next.
Kitty nailed their school photo
They said I could become anything...*so I became a God*.

Thank you for this.
The best thing I have seen in a long time.

This is just everything
Wow... That's amazing
Cue Will Farrel from 2010s
It just needs the lasers in the background like everyone's middle school photo.
Any way you'd give me a brief rundown as to how you did this? I have to do it for my cat. Am *okay* with photoshop, but have a small design firm so I can make somebody at my company do it for me. I think.
[deleted]
Is there an easy way to do a picture like this?
Bohemian Capsody
Now I need a cowboy hat photoshopped on her head
You are a very good catographer.
Agrrrrr.. Touch me parrot, me bite ye carrot!
Hahahahaha!
This sounds stupid but I‚Äôve been desperately trying to find someone to do this picture but of me.
I didn't knew you could even baby sit a Cat. A Dog? Perhaps. But a Cat? Thats new.
Right side: my grandfather from 19th century

Left side: me
I like that it looks a little like the cat is the leader of a communist party.
Can I please turn this into a meme?
I dislike cats and anything cat related but this is fucking great !
How did you do this? Did you use photoshop? I‚Äôd love to do this with my derpy dog
Is there an app I can use to take pictures like this, or do I have to know how to use Photoshop and all that
What is this style of photo called
I wish you were nearby so you could take photos of my two morons!
My friend did this nearly 20 years ago when watching my kitties and dog. Now that I‚Äôve lost my fur babies I‚Äôm so grateful for the pics.
He looks like a kid who‚Äôs mom just told him to smile for the camera.
This post once more proves that the single purpose of cats is to break the internet (and push shit off tables)
Where‚Äôs the one of her on the Purina cat food bag? Loved it.
This photo is amazing!!!
they are so pretty and fierce i‚Äôm jealous
He just needs a mullet.
The little sneersmirk... [kissing fingertips]
Why does the cat in the back look like its gonna take a shit in my shoe for not giving it treats?
Nice lighting
Great job
Omg that face! I love this sooo much.  I want one of my cats.
Hell yeah
You're a good friend.

You are an excellent friend, caretaker and payer of pettaxes!
You did good. I‚Äôm proud of you.
Amazing.
Oh yes
Her face in the bottom is so r/youseeingthisshit
It‚Äôs what every true friend should do.
Now you just need to have it printed and framed and leave it in their house without saying anything
If she hasn't seen it you need to replace one of the photos in her house without her knowing.
Before and after drugs
I love everything about this.
Aw that face tho !!!

This is absolutely great.  I would use it for my desktop if my cat wouldn't get jealous
Ok one serious and one goofy. -Cat probably
I would seriously love this.
The camera is more HD than my eyes
I hate cats. That photo is so good I almost want to buy it. Well done with the humorous contrasting looks you got from the cat.
Jinkies. That‚Äôs an adorable cat. Also, great photo. 10/10 would upvote again.
Awkward teen photo
I am at loss for words at how much I love this

You are an amazing friend for doing this.
Discount kitty
Top right is Hannibal Burress cat
When I was pet sitting for a friend, I took dramatic videos of all her pets, then edited them into the End Animal Cruelty video. She was pissed I did it because she said it made her look like a bad owner, but all the animals in the real video are already rescued, so it actually made her pets look safe.
Yasss!!!! This is the most amazing thing I‚Äôve seen today!
The left picture makes me think of the smart Alec kid from polar Express
The top pose says ‚Äúmajestic‚Äù but the bottom says ‚Äú...but approachable.‚Äù
I NEED to learn how to do this
This is the derpiest cat...
really has the dreamworks face down
You mentioned lighting‚Äîwhat camera gear did you use?
Absolute Masterpiece
Great job!
I wish I had a friend like you
You‚Äôre a great friend.
Will you please come dog sit for me?
This cat looks like it designs Italian sports cars.
Frame it and gift it to your friend! They‚Äôll love it!
Can you please babysitter my cat? How does Saturday sound?
This is awesome
Im making this my desktop wallpaper
This looks like a DreamWorks movie I would actually watch.
Top photo looks like hes leading an army of cats into wars with dogs and laser pointers.
This image has a lot of potential
What a sassy kitty!
This is awesome! Love the cat!
Now you must replace all of the photos in frames with this photo, but don't say anything
Awesome! She is absolutely lovely.
What JOY
Are you gonna frame it?
Eh, needs more 90s laser backdrop.
Majestic.
HOW DO YOU PHOTOSHOP THIS WORK OF ART TOGETHER?!

25k people love that you took time to take pictures of a cat.  I am one of them.
reminds me of the wolf album cover
This is such a cute cat!  I love him.
The one on the right looks so deep in thought, but he‚Äôs got nothing going on in there
This is absolutely fantastic.
Doesnt Will Ferral have a photo just like this of himself?
That's a purrfect pose.
The image in the background makes the cat look like some great philosopher.
President Taft?
So this is the stupid shit people like?
Nice one, Like it Thank you.
This is what i call....

Is there a Sears Studio logo you could put in the corner?
This looks like meme material

She looks like a familiar with a lot of sass! (I've been playing too much DnD lately)
Obituary photo material
That smile.
This is a really wholesome post. Thanks OP
frame it and put it in the house somewhere randomly with out them knowing.
Your friend‚Äôs going to love it.
i need one with just the foreground picture
That is a purrrty chunky cat with the long whiskers/vibrissae...and of course I googled kitty whiskers in order to learn the new term of vibrissae.
/u/cyXie would love this
You should submit this to r/photoshopbattles
Did you do this with a backdrop or just edit out the background?
AMAZING! Get a frame!
Awesome. I have pretty much all the gear (except a decent backdrop/sweep) for my (black) dog but just haven't bothered to put in the time to set up a space.

&#x200B;

I really should get onto that.
Handsome kitteh...
Your cat looks like Joseph Stalin, in a cute furry way
`

This is great. What do you drive op?!
Majestic as fuck.
what lighting and backgrounds did you use? My aunt owns eight dumb cats and I want to make one of these, framed and all, for each and every one of them

plot: cat exist. cat have inner self. you know where this is going.
How do you do this?
What? Do this for my dog please!
Fucking gold, my dude.
Superstar!
you probably wont see this but I always have a ridiculously difficult time masking out backgrounds from whiskers on animals, but your whiskers are so clean. How do you accomplish it?
This makes me want professional photos of my animals
She's chesshire cat material for sure.
This cat has the style of a boss ^^
Omg she looks like my cat!!!! I love her
Get it framed. Theyll love it.
That's Cat Stalin.
She will love it!!! I would!!
So I think I just realized this but is this style of photo just a double exposure? Like were they just really into that in the 80‚Äôs?
So "cat sitting".. üòÅ i love the lip goin up. like he's not so sure of whats goin on? üôÉüòç
Purrfection.
This is amazing.

Quite a dapper cat

Sassy kitty and thoughtful or surprised kitty
You should babysit my cat.
Best catbabysitter ever!
How did you make it look like that? Photoshop?
I wish you were my friend... I wouldn't mind a cat either, but my two dogs wouldn't allow it..
P H O T O G E N I C
Can I have this as a painting?
If a friend babysat my cat and sent me this level of photo they would go from a friend to my best friend instantly hahah.
This is some wholesome content.
I will say this. Cats are so much easier than dogs.
Bottom left looks like a Dreamworks character voiced by Bill Murray.
Someone needs to paint this picture, then have someone paint thier picture of them painting this picture.
This is beautiful
Worth it.
Badass
Plot twist: it was actually a dog. Photoshop level 100.
So gracious
Hahahah oh my god, I‚Äôm going to start doing this for all my friends‚Äô cats!
The expressions are outstanding!

I love his FACE!!
That smirk says it all
This is so nice. I would be so happy if someone did this for me!
I can‚Äôt even get my baby sitter to do the dishes.
I would honestly be in tears if someone did this for me with my fur kids. What a great gift!
There's gotta be a sub for photos like these.
This is such a great portrait, props to you as a photographer. Portrait photography is truly an art, imo - you have to get the lighting and composition just right and help the the subject become comfortable enough to look natural and relaxed. And that's just with people! I hope you'll print this out and give it to her people.
It's smirking...what...how?
This cat is higher than I am.
Buzz, your girlfriend. Whoof!
Well did you give it some ü•õ
That‚Äôs my 8th grade graduation photo!!!
I hope your friend blows this up and frames it!
OP, will you post this to /r/PhotoshopBattles ?
How hard is this to do and what should I expect to pay someone to do it for me?
Good work. Beautiful cat with personality.
Please be located in Chicago?? I will pay good money for you to capture my Mr. Clydefrog‚Äôs derpy essence.

Adult Swim bump

This is pure awesomeness.
She looks like she‚Äôs ready to bait small children onto a busy road
u/JDMcompliant looks great! What is your setup like? Recently got myself a good portrait lens and want to make a photo booth out of an unused room in my house.
Haha there are pictures just like this of my mom and her siblings in high school at my grandma‚Äôs house. What is this style called?
Beautiful I luv it!
Hey I saw this in new, congratulations!
Can you babysit my cat
Looks Asian
I laughed so hard at this! I love it!!
The only thing left that could improve this, as I haven‚Äôt seen it in the comments, is a three wolf moon version.
We need a leader who's brave, sincere, and not afraid to look silly. Vote for Jade this upcoming 2020 election.

What childless millennials do
Its like derp cat and Stalin cat lolol
This is magnificent
This is amazing haha
Your friend is very lucky to have you as a friend.
I‚Äôd rather you not send it to her, and have it framed and hanging on the wall for when she gets home.
I love this so much
Bottom left looks like the night king right after tanking dragon pulse.
Looks a bit like the Cheshire Cat from the live action Alice and Wonderland.
 I love grey catsssss
Two words: well done. (Yeah, I know, that's four words)
And the squinched face
That smile

Please to be babysitting my cats, good sir!
Musta
Can you babysit me please?
Background look like cat Stalin
How did you achieve such clean masking with the whiskers? 

My first guess would be the background eraser tool, or the magic wand brush... *But if you tell me that you hand masked the whiskers with a polygon selection, I'm most definitely going to cry... For myself and you*
A piece of art caused me to have an emotional reaction.
This is amazing. 

I'm not a photographer. I have a Sony Nex5 and I could never take a photo like this
I honestly love this so freaking much!!
Looks like a movie poster
Why are we still here
Two sides of a delightful coin
Look at this pretty kitty
Your friend looks like a cat.
Damn, your friend has an awesome friend!
this car reminds me of night king lol
Gorgeous. 11/10. Perfection; such taste.
Skeptical cat vs gullible cat.
If the Reddit silver was a cat, it would be this one.
This is exactly the Will Farrel meme just in cat form
Great work.
I fucking love this. This is the album cover of some cat singer
Excellent!
That's awesome. I want to make something cool like that for my dog one day
Will you babysit my cats, please?
If someone did this for my cat, I would truly be at a loss for words as to how grateful I was
So cute!
Omg!! I want you to do this with my kitty it‚Äôs so good üò≠

This picture SCREAMS Cats vs. Dogs
So regal and so derpy.

I want this on a t-shirt

I don't know why but she low-key looks like CGI...
Such a pretty kitty!
What is that 80's style of photos called?
How do you do that? I've been wanting to make Christmas cards like this forever but can't figure out how it's done!
I wonder if you could do a Three Wolf Moon parody with this cat
What's the style of picture called
If I were a cat
Is it just me or does this photo have serious meme potential
She has a similar smirk as Rocket from Guardians of Galaxy
Perfection.
Screen print this onto a shirt for her ASAP
So Cute XD

I adore this photo! I'd love to have one of my furball but he never sits still! Got any tips for me that won't result in a weird blur?
Nice job

That upper one reminds me somewhat of a japanese captein looking down on his soldiers.
One on the left reminds me of Harrison Ford.

Looks like a dramatic soap opera opening scene. Days of our Nine Lives.
Not sure how but this post's picture ended up on my screen away from me. Thank you for the great convo I'm having now lmao
Cats are dope. Really have nothing else to contribute except that I like the part with the cat smirk.
Hey /u/JDMCompliant how did you do this? I'd like to do this for my cats is this just two photoshop layers or some simpleton shit like that? I expect it's easier than I imagine.
Thanks I hate it
Lovely cat.  Reminds me of that Will Ferrell meme.

You are the best kind of friend.
Does anyone know of some video guide on how to edit and create this type of an image? I think this style is quite common.

I would frame this picture in my bedroom.
You're catsitting.
Those are some majestic fucking whiskers.
You should put it up as a stock photo for people to buy. One day he'll be looking for cat food and his cat will be staring into his eyes from a Meow-Mix bag.
