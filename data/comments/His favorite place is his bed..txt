Ah. Dachshunds. I lived on a farm with a pair when I was a kid. 

Never have I met dogs with such violent, aggressive killing instincts. They went after EVERYTHING, and were rarely unsuccessful. 

So. Many. Dead. Groundhogs. 

Every spring you'd find the bodies of the pups spread all over the field like a wee whistle pig genocide.
My black lab's favorite place is his bed in the kennel I keep in my bedroom. When I'm finally ready to go to bed, I ask him "Puppers, you ready for bedtime?" and he takes off down the hallway, noses open the kennel door, and thwumps down with a long, contented.... groany sigh? It's like *hrrrrrrrrrrnnnnnnnnph* and he usually starts snoring before I'm under my own bedcovers.

It's bc it's a weenie dog ...it's his legs, it looks like y'all just got back from walk. 

I'm about 5ft even while my mom is 4'7. Her ex hubby was 6'2. My high school soon to be MY first ex hubby was 6'5ft .... the thing we joked about the most in regards to such a huge height difference is how we were CONSTANTLY SCURRYING along when walking w our ex'es bc our tall EX's had such a huge stride in comparison to ours.

To add to my experience when I was pregnant I took parenting class (nvr held a baby or even baby sat before my own so I was TERRIFIED & took every class/read every book) ... anyway one of class exercises was when we got to class teacher asked us all to raise our arms/hands up & hold it in position until she said to let them down, about 10mins or less we were all bitching/moaning until she said "bring arms down" then said think about how small a toddler is, how their strides r so much smaller than ours and add us parents wanting to hold their hands bc we don't want them wandering off ... reminded me of my ex ..I'd complain that my arm would need rest after walking holding hands & he would get his feelings hurt bc he thought I was just not wanting to hold his hand ... but seriously my arm was almost in raised position!

Growing up we had small dogs. And I always wanted a big dog. My daughter has 2 Great Danes that she got in college (ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)that have lived w us on & off and hubby/I have watched for weekends when daughter needed babysitter.

When I'd take girls for a walk. Older girl is big girl & moves at pace of turtle. But younger girl is slim, spazzy, & likes to RUUUN! Whenever I'd walk girls by myself, big girl & I would b leisurely strolling while younger girl would b literally RUNNING CIRCLES around us bc we were tooo sloooooow! One day hubby/I took both for walk & while girls/I were doing our usual stroll w other one running rings around us, hubby said "ok that's sad" and he called younger one & they would run up ahead & run back to us, run ahead & run back to us. On one of the times they took off I looked down & said "what spazzes!" And I swear the big girl basically rolled her eyes, huffed & stared off at the fools RUNNING while we were strolling lol!

Sorry for long reply but basically I'm a human equivalent of a weenie dog while rest of human race are labs. When walking weenie dogs remember we take a million steps to your one ‚ù§Ô∏è

Haha, great to watch, thank you for the upload! In the video it's not like "my home is inside these doors", but definitely "my home, my real home, is this bed".

This will probably seem silly but I'll tell it anyway: the title brings to mind an old, nowadays deceased, relative of mine who survived two world wars. When his son asked him in the nineties: "where is your home / how do you define home" (I don't know the exact translation in English, and the question came from the fact he had been removed from his childhood home area at the beginning of WWII), he answered "my home is where my bed is, the best place in the world is a bed I slept in last night and one that I can return to tonight". I think I can understand what he meant  even though I definitely haven't gone through any of the incomprehensible stuff he had gone through.
