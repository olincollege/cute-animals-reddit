Those ears!!
i love bats, they're so cute and they're so interesting with how they fly and they are so great at pest control. 

i see some around my house every time it's dusk and the light hasn't gone out too much so you can see them against the sky, zooming around. 
The wing skin looks like some man made material it's so smooth. The animal kingdom is amazing. 
Intimidating wings and claws but cute af.
The cuteness we need, but not the cuteness we deserve
To get them excited you just have to say "Who wants to go to the dark!?"
What kind?
That is the most amazing thing I've seen in a while. I, too, want a flying doggie. 
I'm just mesmerized by this. i never knew bats could be both so large and cute. I want to give it a milk-bone.
My 10 month old daughter, who knows 2 words, woof and meow, said woof woof when we watched this 
"Bats are blind ya know"... As it looks right freaking at you... With its EYES
/r/batty for more bats! 
Excuse me sir! It is the middle of the day! Some of us are trying to sleep!
I bet Batman would be a little different, if these were the bats that flew over him.
Was wondering what was under that umbrella. Was not disappointed.
My opinion of bats has been permanently been changed. How adorable is that little face 
You had my upvote, right off the bat.
I think bats are really cool animals 
Protect our bats!

I never realised until now how amazing bats are, they are mammals with wings and the abilities to really fly. That never sunk in until now.

Guys, I think OP's fooling us with a picture of a dog wearing a raincoat.
Am I the only one who finds this terrifying?

I think bats are incredible animals, there is a small section of forest not too far from my house where an entire family of 100,s spends its days. they are wild but you can get close enough to touch them (although I wouldn't advise actually reaching out a hand. lol) 
TIL: bats are just flying dogs 
What a fat little nightmare biscuit
Alright someone tell us all why having a bat as a pet is a terrible idea.
It's that frantic little ear wiggle that really gets me. 
Why do bats rest upside down? Is it better?

Fun fact: bats always fly left out of a cave.
I honestly thought that was a malfunctioning black umbrella before its head popped out... And yes, didn't pay attention to the background at first.

U/yungcaligula why is this so cute 
Does anyone know what kind of bat this is? 
That bat looks very healthy. 
Dem cute eyes bat
JUSTICE!!!!!
Wtf!! Anyone else think that was a dog dressed up as a bat. lol
They're extremely cute as adolescents, but sadly many are abandoned when they grow up and become vampires :(
Beautiful, love bats
/u/_chark_ bats are cute when they aren't on your porch
I remember going on field trips to Natural Bridge Caverns when I was little and it was the coolest experience ever. I love the huge rooms and how it's 20° cooler. Geology is amazing!!
I too love bats.Had a little fella somehow get trapped in the house just the other night and we got her safely back out using a pool net. Cat was so excited tho thought it was her new toy.
I am the night!
Hooman, let me sleep!
Most animals get cuter when they get smaller... except I guess for bats...
Flying dog-cats
So dang adorable!

I wish I had one. I love bats so much. They're so sweet and cute and I'm sure very fun and nice to have. 🦇
He needs my cuddles.
Buried storytime: one night I awoke in my bed to something cuddling into my neck. It was furry. My first half asleep instinct was to grab it and throw it across the room - can't explain why. There was a squeak and I jumped up to turn on the light. I yelled at my husband that there was something in here and I threw it across the room. It was a bat. We captured it and come to find we should take it to a facility to be tested for rabies (rip bed buddy bat). It was rabid, we had to get weeks' worth of shots just in case there were bites or scratches we didn't know about or couldn't see. It was the first case of rabies in 2006 (was already October!) for my county.
[deleted]
I want it... It is so cute and adorable and just omg
Fun fact. All bats are known to carry some of the most lethal diseases in the world and are immune them.
"Stop it! Stop it! I am the *night!*"
I shall name you.....umbrella
Bat-Farmer: "this one is ripe for picking, you can see that he's got flippy floppy ears and beady black eyes. Yep this is some high quality flying mammal right there"
So this is the thing Batman was afraid of?
Um...no thank you :(
 blah blah blah 
Correct me if I'm wrong but don't bats carry a range of viruses incl. rabies and the lyssa virus? Pretty sure the latter can kill you:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyssavirus
I read that thread on reddit about bats and rabies last night ... fuck this gif and fuck that thread, I went around my house last night and duct taped any crack I could find because now I'm terrified of getting bit by a rabid bad in my sleep
Can't you get rabies like this?
Rabiies???!!! Noone?? Anyone?
Is that even safe?  Don't those guys carry a ton of disease?  I heard their poop can be made in to gun powder in a pinch, along with some other stuff.
Yes bartender? I'll have the rabies shots please, make it a double. 
Do you want rabies, Lana? Because that's how to get rabies.
Part of me is like ;awwww; The larger part of me is like ;eeeeeeeek;

I AM THE NIGHT! I AM THE....ooh chin scratches.
That's a bat 
Are bats winged chihuahuas?
In laymen terms: Is there a large genetic gap between the fox/puppy looking bats & the more vicious creepy looking bats? Do the fox bats eat fruits, while the creepy ones are reliant on mammal blood? 
 Why have i been scared my entire life of these cute little creatures?
The ears get me every time
SO CUTE! 
Those eyes. 
Next stop Batcave
So this is what scared Bruce?
Something's wrong with your dog
Bats are so cute. 
Fleshy winged bird dog.
The wings make me feel uncomfortable but that is such an adorable face for a bat
Fun fact about bats: Bats can eat up to 1,200 mosquitoes in an hour and often consume their body weight in insects every night, helping keep bug populations in check.

Any animal that eats that many mosquitos is definitely my friend. 
umbrella doggos. =) 
Every bat video I see they always look so domesticated and friendly? Can they be aggressive towards humans?
Even when it's not a dog, people still say pupper and doggo. I hate Reddit culture. 

Does anyone know if this is at the Pittsburgh Aviary?

Can we just call bats darkboyes
Lol that bat is cute asf
Why do people say bats are ugly when videos like this exist? Found two baby bats on a tree a few years ago. Bottlefed them milk, then realized that their mom would miss them and they seemed anxious. Returned them and have loved bats since.
That's freaking adorable!!!  Bat's are so misunderstood. Friendly little eaters of mosquitos and other annoying insects. 
I love his wittle flappy ears. 

Bats are our friends!

My girl is a pupper of darkness too. Here she is, rolled up like a bat! 
Watch out, I hear bats are the number one transmitter of rabies to humans.
The Prince of Rabies.

I mean bats are a huge carrier of rabies so I don't understand the down votes, clearly this bat doesn't have rabies but I was just making a joke.  I guess my joke just wasn't funny, I get it. 
*sigh* now I want a bat
Is that an actual bat?? Because oh my god it's so cute
aww
He's a good boy!
Bats are so wonderful! Here in Austin, TX, we have a bridge that's full of Mexican free-tailed bats. Every evening, you can go and see them fly away from the bridges by the millions as they hunt for insects; they practically obscure the sky. It's truly a awesome sight sight to behold, whether you're on the bridge, across Lady Bird Lake, or on a tourist boat. The city originally intended to exterminate these bats, but due to the revenue from tourism and the pest control that they provided, the city decided not to. We even have a giant bat statue situated in the middle of town now! :)
Basically dogs with wings 
Me:"I swear to God, that's the cutest bat I've ever seen."

If Batman was a bat
Hey hey I'm trying to sleep here
dont wake him hes tryna sleep
/u/bumchuck69
I've only seen really small bats before, I ran away.
"WHAT DO YOU WANT!!?? huh? It's still daytime, what the hell are you thinking? I'm going back to bed"
It is a shame bats make such horrible candidates for domestication into pets.


Is someone growing bats?
I just go to show my girlfriend this vid bc she love cute faced animals....She laughes and shows me her phone bc she was looking at the same video shared on FB 😄.
They are indeed cute. Too bad they make death pooty.
I always go batshit crazy for posts like these
Can't look at this the same way cause I woke up to a dead bat on my kitchen floor this morning 
Almost too cute to bite its head off
i wish i could pet a bat one day. it looks so soft 
The puppy to end it all
Really peculiar animals, definitely unlike birds despite the flying thing.
needs some Ray-Bans....he no like the light
I used to be into Bats when I was a kid, even helped my dad build some bat houses and joined some club.  Now I'm 34 and just remembered all of this, which is great.  I blocked out a big chunk of my childhood for other reasons and this post just gave me some of it back. Thank you OP. 
I wish bats made good pets
Why are bats so damn cute??
At first I thought he was shuffeling a black shopping bag... Confusing :)
what is a bat wings made out of? looks like some type of cloth 
That's a good looking bat, wish he'd come to my house and eat some skeeters
Stupid question.....why won't my kindle ever let me watch these videos?what am I missing besides kindle sucks?

What type of bat is this? Scrolled down a bit but not into reading every comment.....thanks.
I WANT TO SEE MORE
It's so weird that the biggest bat of them all is the only one that doesn't creep me out.
*Bork*
It's so cute, but its claw are so not. 
A post yesterday about rabies has now officially given me a phobia of bats
Okay, so question: if I see a bat, should I freak out or not? Reddit has left me very confused as to whether or not dangerous animals are actually dangerous.
So like, I'm now wondering...how soft is bat fur?
Fruit Bats are so cute! Anyone know if they make good pets?

OP, you have kankles, but the wrist version.
I love flying bears
Aaaand just like that i want a flying fox
oh wow, they're actually cute.
Never thought I'd say this, but that's a cute bat. 
So you think darkness is your ally?
That is fuckin cool ..... I'd love to meet him ....
Awww that is one darling bat, so cute!
*"Heyyyyy... I was sleeping!"*
Did you breed a dog with a bat? Please tell me you didn't.
I just started to look for a cool bat house design that I can build and hang in a large tree in my backyard.

You don't need mosquito magnet when you have a colony of bats living  in your yard.




Just wait a few years and it will start breathing Fire and ride you to victory in battle with the Dothrakhi hordes.
OP is a vampire. 
I want one!
That is awesome! 
I dunno, looks blind to me. 
1st thought: why is he stroking that umbrella?
2nd thought: woah, a bat..
3rd thought: awwwwww those eyes!
If you woke me up like that I'd a scratched the shit outta ya.
Those ears are trying to create lift
Dude what the fuck, can bats be mated with dogs they look such alike lol. I wonder if somone has tried a dog bat would be dope. 
"Reads through thread" spots the word rabies over 10x. Yep i'm not insane.
Ah the good Ol' chicken of the cave...
The little ear wiggles <3
Goddamnit they're cute, but I fuckin shat my pants when I saw one of those fuckers flying through my room at 3 am, just because we didn't close the balcony door.
I thought he was trying to open an unmbrella at first..
Bats are usually super cute minus the rabies
Let the baby sleep :(
What species of bats is this?
I would love to have a few of these guys. I'm about to make some bat boxes. Need some info on where to get a few insect bats in the near future.
Do all animals enjoy being pet? Or is it just something humans enjoy doing?
I love fruit bats. 
BEEEBEEE!
Nope. 
So cute! ❤️❤️❤️🤗
Bats wings look leathery
Oh sure they're cute. Until they shit on your car and melt the paint 
How does one go about obtaining and keeping a pupper of darkness? I'm sure you would need special licenses or something,no?
What type of bat is this it's huge?! We only have pipistrelles here, they are so dinky. Save one from my cat the other day! Thinking about becoming a bat carer and rescuing grounded bats, just need to make a cat 🐱 proof enclosure and recover area. They are so cute! Love them. The wee fella I save I wanted to nurse him back to perfect health. 
it's kind of cutey-scary
The good ol' chicken of the cave.
Those ears!!!!
cute nightmare
Little brown guy at the back is all "can you guys keep it down, I'm tryna sleep here!".
That umbrella has a face!
Man... I need an animal job... that pays well.
My fucking god. I can't believe how cute this is.
That ear movement tho
The girth of that wrist makes me wonder if those bats aren't a food supply. 
I mean.....they are adorable. But yesterday I listened to a podcast about rabies and so I'll just admire them from afar. 
Pretty sure they are called the chicken of the cave
Why do they have eyes ? 
Love bats!! 
Roberto T. Fruitbat!
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen ❤❤❤
So cool 
They call em chicken of the cave.
Holy shit... I had no idea bats get that big!!!! That is awesome
It's ears! 
DARKNESS!!!
Do these boyes make good pets because I seriously want one.
Hey zoology people, is the flying primate hypothesis completely unfounded? What makes megabats so distinct from all other bat species? 
Aw!  I never knew bats could be so cute!
You woke the little guy up from his nap. 
Don't forget to wash your hands.
The ear wigglies!
Are these "pet" bats? I think if I done that to a bat in a cave it would unleash Hell on me 
That bat seems unusally clean.
Can you get thoughs as pets ?
Honestly didn't know bats go this big. I feel for Batman, man.
Yep ... you're right ! By god I learnt something today ! 
Holy god I would shit my pants if I was anywhere near these things.
This looks like someone's backyard
Nope. Nope. Nope. Fuck bats. Fucking hellspawn devil creature. Oh and cause people are dumb, more squirrels have rabies than bats do, cause bats don't need rabies to be fucking terrifying.
I WANT ONE .... OR TEN .....!!
Their ears are wild :)
I want a dog this metal.
Nice giant fruit bat
"it's like a little bear cat!!!!" -my girlfriend just now whilst crying 
Hello, Bruce
I never thought I'd be seeing the day when a bat is cute, especially more so than half of the cats on the internet.
Bats are all fun and games until they get into your house every night and shit all over the place. 
Everyone knows they are just chickens of the cave.
I look equally confused when someone decides to wake me up in the middle of the day.
A totally irrational NOPE from me. They jerk around like they are fevered and diseased, even when they aren't. I envision my hand going near it and being gnawed off, leaving a viscous green fluid on the jagged stump. 
Weird question, but are these dudes capable of affection? 
Can I have this set up at my home? I need more bat lovins 
Need 
Great now I want a bat as a pet
Apparently they *can* see and Neil Degrasse Tyson has been made fun of on the internet because he does not know this.

Tens of thousands of people are around cows every day. Do you even know how large the cattle industry is? And I'm not even talking about dairy farmers. Your argument is invalid. Got Milk?
Anyone else sing that title like Tom Jones?
Wow, that's like the cutest thing I've seen.
I had no idea bat could be cute
What are you doing, you fool?!  I AM THE NIGHT!
dose EARS! :D
I love bats! They’re so cute <3

It’s a shame that there are so few of them in my city, and that they are considered a pest here because of rabies...
that bat is quite fluffy
Honest question: How is a bat okay with this? Everything I've observed tells me bats aren't okay with someone aggressively petting them while they're hanging around stuff.
Fun fact: bats always fly left out of a cave.
Want one!
What are the bats that can really bite humans and where are they located?

Another fun fact: Bat guano was a commodity during the civil war, used for making gunpowder.

Why are you petting an umbrella. Omg! Awww
Flying mammals!
Such amazing and gorgeous creatures.

I love bats so much!!! There needs to be more cute bat videos!!! They're so cute and so interesting!!!!
I'm terrified now.
I am darkness, I am the night, I! AM! CUTE!
Bats.  One of the few mammals I absolutely love.  Unfortunately I have only handled a few (gray bats) to take measurements and we were being very cautious about not getting bit.  
They're magnificent. And this also makes me realize that Batman's "ears" on the cowl are all wrong. 
Oooo my gaaawwwd he's so cute!
Those ears!!!
So, this was when Ash first encountered a Zubat! I have always wanted to see this!
I'm so fucking scared of these things

Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
Let me go I say!!!! Do you not know that we rule the night?!!!
Fruit bats are the most adorable creatures ever the best part is they are anywhere roughly from 2ft to 3ft. 
At first glimpse i thought it was a dog in a bag.
One of those bad boys flew in my house a few weeks back. 45 minutes I never want to relive.

Yeah, *that* bat in particular is cute, but the other types (breeds?) of bats, the smaller ones with the giant ears, upturned noses, and very visible fangs... woogh!
Omg it's adorable! Oh btw I wouldn't touch that...
I love how bats have turned from scary vampire blood suckers to sky puppers because of the internet.
Hello darkness my old friend
That bat looks very healthy. 
GIMME CHIN RUBS! I AM THE NIGHT! I-aaaahhhhhh, that's the stuff, right there 8P
Riddle me this...Riddle me that...

This is the kind of shit my nightmares of made of. Attacked by bat at age 10. Rabies shots happened. Eep.

Dude! What the hey! What for you wake me up eh?!

Ahhh!! I love bats, this is adorable and made my evening. 
Never seen one that close. The ones online and in books look nothing like that. It literally looks like a dog. Have an up vote. 
That is so dog-like!! I wish I was more dog-like!
Did anyone else misread and click to see the puppet?
So much cuteness!! Love bats !

How does one acquire said pupper of darkness.

Yeah, just wait until it bites you and you tun into a vampire.
ITS SO FLUFFFYYY
Every trailer park in America will have at least one dog bat once this makes the rounds on Facebook. Shortly after that will be posts in the classified ads by people who need someone to take their dog bat because the apartment they're moving into doesn't allow pets. 
Bat Manuel
Why don't we start domesticating bats now? 
Look at that lovely sheen on his wings. Such s well groomed bat this is. BATGENTLEMAN. 
( ( ( D O G G I E  D A R K O ) ) )
Would love to own a domesticated flying fox. Is anyone in the process of trying to do that?
I was really hoping that it was a dog in a bat suit

Awwwww
Darkness isn't so bad sometimes. Night-time is dark, and that's when it's cool and the stars can come out and shine their glimmering light. Night-time is also when the moon is the prettiest. 

And when we're tired, night-time is there so the sunlight doesn't get into our eyes as we drift into sleep and dream.

Darkness isn't so bad sometimes.
Eeeee they are so cute!!!!!
*the ear waggle*
"Thank you for the belly-rubs, hooman. Here: have some rabies"
I love in minnesota and the bats here are attracted to lighters so my dad (mind you he was 28)( I was 7) and his friends would light their lighters and the bats would swoop down right next to us
Why can't they all be this cute?
Am I the only one that freaks out when I see bats?
I love bats... But the only problem i have against them is the diseases they may cause...
What a big cutie!
I read this as Purpose of Darkness.

What a solid band name creation on the fly.
Well that was terrifying in the most strange way I have ever experienced.
So scary. So cute. I didn't know my ex and bats had so much in common.
"I AM VENGEANCE, oh yeah right there, I AM NIGH- oh, a bit there, thank you."

Remind me why we we're supposed to be afraid of these guys again?
Bats are so cute!  I don't know why people are afraid of them.  
Now I wanna look after bats...but I also wanna look after bees..... 
I need a bat like this
Cool
All I can think of is that banana, that the poor pig ate, that the cook wiped on his apron, that killed Gwyneth Paltrow...
Is it possible and wise to domesticate bats?
This gif single-handedly made me go from being terrified of bats to loving them...

....God it’s adorable. 
oh no.. please wait.. make sure your nails won't cut its soft wings.
Sweet, puppet of darkness.
Not expecting to AWWWWWWWWWWWWW at a bat but omg AWWWWWWWWWWWW
They always remind me of that movie *The Great Outdoors
Want to feed it a fruit sooooo bad!

That sweet face! I can't get over how cute bats are 😘😍
Sure it's cute, but I don't think you should tie a cat up by its legs.
Stop that! No I am not adorable! I am the night!

Looks like a Chihuahua with wings to me! I would have one as a pet. My Chihuahua would be confuzzled though for sure. 
This is how Bruce Wayne became Batman. True Story.

Why does that bat look like a puppy? What kind of bat is that? This is the cutest bat I've seen, I've never seen bats like that in my place. 
A few weeks ago I spent 2 weeks in the Borneo rain forest with the uni, in the second week we got to choose our own projects to work on in the field and me and my lab partner decided to find bat roost sites and try to get an idea about how many were staying around the field centre then at night going out with the bat detector and recording bat echolocation.

At the end of the week we had a few roost sites with pictures each day trying to identify the species present and hundreds of short echolocation sound files. I felt pretty bad a few days in waking up the bats again whilst taking photos, by the end of the week they didn't try to fly away and instead just looked at you with really sleepy looking eyes, such a beautiful animal.
That's some cute ass rabies. 
I thought it was a hanging umbrella at first.

That thing is huge.( thats what she said) 
Looks like a baby bear cub dressed in a bat costume.
He  (of she) looks like: "Whaaaaat, is it already time to get up  again? 

Duuuuuuuuude Lemmesleeeeeeeep!!!

Nevertheless, very cute. He/she absolutely looks a whole lot better-kempt and in a better mood me when I'm just rolling out of sleep. What a sweet snout!
The fact you have a pet bat is really cool to me
Lmao wtf, I love bats now?
