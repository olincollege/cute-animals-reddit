"Fool of a Tok !"
He nearly has a peace sign on his face. He's cute!
What breed is this beautiful boy
Actually showing pictures of Reddit on the sofa to my 73yo father right now. Way to go buddy. Lovable doggo ‚ô•Ô∏è
He is superhero. He even has a mask! Super good boy tok.
Hello Tok and Grandpa! Keep safe!!
What a good boy! Beautiful eyes! He must be a great friend to have on your side.
So you worded it nearly exact to this 100k+ post from 10 hours ago? Of course..

https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/hidwoj/every_night_my_daughter_and_i_look_at_raww_before

e: Welp.. looks like you did exactly what you were trying to do. I posted this at ~5k and now you're over 100k. Congrats I guess...

Isn‚Äôt this just a rehash of a recent post?
Thought the dog was named after ‚ÄúTik Tok‚Äù thank God it‚Äôs not lol
Is this the new template for karma farming?

"Me and [very old/young relative] browse r/aww everytime we [wholesome activity] and they asked me to share a picture of [pet]. Reddit, meet [pet name]."
Made up stories for likes - so hot right now.
Damn same thing happened yesterday with a daughter
Tok the younger!
ReDdIt, MeEt My AsS
If a Took saved Middle Earth, Tok can make it to the front page!
Such a sweet dog, with his lovely eyes and poofy ears. A true good boy. Greetings and love to your grandpa!

Just post the fucking dog, we don‚Äôt need the fake ass backstory.
those eyes !!
THE POST HISTORY OH MY GOD
I FUCKING ADORE TOK
Why spelt Tok if it‚Äôs pronounced Took? Why not just Took?
When you see someone post a similar title the day before so you post for a karma grab
Don't show grandpa your post history
It‚Äôs nice took meet you
Tok takes a great pic!
Good boy Tuck. Such a sweetie
Why spell it Tok if it‚Äôs pronounced took? I‚Äôm genuinely curious.
The comments are the best but a husky with a smile takes the cake.
Everyone‚Äôs commenting on Tok (he‚Äôs adorable), but I just want to say your grandpa sounds precious, and I‚Äôm sure he is. Give him a hug from reddit please!
This is like the platonic ideal of a dog for me.
Just want to give him ear scratches and belly rubs! I bet he gets a lot of those! I had a Malamute named Yukon Cornelius Icecream bar (don't judge, I was like 9 when I got her, she lived 17 years) and we called her Yuk. Pronounced "Yook". There's something majestic about dogs like this. They are almost human lol. He's beautiful!
Aww, what a cutie
What a 10/10 good boy
symetric af
Thats a fantastic looking dog!
Soooo handsome! 
And hello to your grandpa too!
Aww what a beautiful smile! Virtual hugs to grandpa!
Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!

Sorry couldn't resist. What a cute doggo!
He has an arrow on his snoot pointing to the best place to pet him.
Poor dog. has to spend whole life spelling his name because rhe old man wanted him to be unique.
Whelp, Grandpa just got another 250+ grandkids. Make sure you know Grandpa as such...
hi grandpa! we love you and your precious doggo!
we have the daughter and the grandpa's dog.  my money is on autistic little bro for the next one
Hi Grandpa!

Good looking dog.

I‚Äôm sending you hugs!

I‚Äôm missing mine today. He‚Äôs in heaven with my grandmother. üò¢
He definitely didn't ask you to post a picture of his dog on Reddit.
Cuteness overload! I just love those couple crooked little bottom teeth! Ahh!
Literally the exact template as yesterdays post, almost word for word. Did you copy/paste? Nice originality üëç
So this is a thing now?
[deleted]
u/eatingplutonium me when i see u
This dog is so adorable!  Look at the symmetrical eyebrows on this angel.  I showed this to my gf after she had a work meeting and she had the biggest smile.  Thanks Tok!
You make it sound like 70 is an old age. Don't you know that 70's are the new 30's???
"Tok" in Swedish basically means "crazy guy" (more playful than anything else) so I hope he fits the bill! Super cute, makes it hard for me to wait two years to get a dog!
Tok was the first place we slept when we moved to Alaska! Awesome name!
Sorry to bother you sir/madam, but unfortunately I'm gonna need you and your grandpa's permission to engage in some long-distance internet cuddling with Tok. Is that okay?
Your grandpa and Tok have made my morning. So very sweet and Tok is a gorgeous pup.
Tok is beautiful!
Thanks for showing Took (to) us
It's nice that you're spending time with your grandpa and sharing interests. You're good person.
Awww hello goodest boy ever!!
Pretty pup, I‚Äôm happy to hear your grandpa has a good boy by his side üòä
hi pretty boy Tok!  Hi to your Grandpa too!
What a good boy
He's so cute! Love his name.
What a cutie!
Emotional karma farming :D nice
Say hi to your grampa and tok for me üíñüíñüíñ stay cuddly
What a handsome good boy
Hi Tok!
Hi, Tok!
Hi tok, Hi Grandpa\~!!
Witchy eyes, nicr
TELL HIM HIS DOG IS THE CUTEST THING I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE IN THIS UNIVERSE
He‚Äôs gorgeous and actually looks like a grandad dog. You know, like he‚Äôd tell you stories about his youth, teach you how to do stuff and look after you.
These dogs always seem to have the most intelligent eyes. Not to mention being beautiful animals in general.
[Markings are very similar to my good boy :) ](https://iili.io/JmCRVe.jpg)
F≈´l of a Tok!
You fool of a Tok
You make 70 sound so old. Don't you know 70 is the new 50. :) Bless you though for spending time with your grandpa. Ask him lots of questions about the Viet Nam war, integration, women's rights, the Beatles, and abortion rights. Ask him if women wore pants all the time before 1970.
Your a good grandson. So many kids today ignore their family. Grandparents are often forgotten and spend their golden year alone. Keep it up, you have no idea how much it means to him.
 I guess you can say he...

Tok my heart away.
I am 70 years old, and I brows Reddit to brighten my day.  Someday, I will have to post a picture of my rescue dog (not as hansome as yours).  Say Hi to your grandpa for me, and let him know that he isn't the only 70 year old on Reddit.
Awwww what a beautiful dog I had one that looked the same! He was so smart and my best friend for years. Beautiful beautiful  dog.
He's got a pupvote on his snoot. He's officially a redditawwr.
Isn't it amazing how our pets can be so comforting and understanding.  I am a dog person, and have had small dogs my whole life. There is a picture of me in my little crib, and my puppy, born the same day as me, using my tushy as a pillow. 

I now have a 12.5 year old Pomeranian,  name Frappuccino,  who still proves my point.  Last February,  our little blonde pomeranian,  Snickerdoodle,  pasted away. She was 15 years, and 8 months when she died. Frap was such a comfort! Even though he was also mourning. He would carry her toys around, and would collect them and bring them up on the bed. If I was crying, he will look at my face very carefully, and kiss the tears off.

Your grandpa is loved by his Tok, and will help him with his loss, and you are helping both of them by visiting and checking on them.

Thank you for sharing Tok, and for reminding me of my dog's live for me.
HI GRANDPA!
He is SO handsome and looks like an absolute sweetheart. Happy he and your grandfather found each other!
What a good dog

My Papa has dementia and on good days we can browse this sub for quite some time and it keeps his interest. It's one of the few ways we "communicate." He can't express himself very well anymore, but he gets very excited and constantly points and laughs at all the cute animals.
You Tok a great pic!

Hey grandpa! That looks like a good doggo!
Tok (pronounced took) means silliness / unwise antics / insanity (it's a word that depends on context) in Swedish, sounds like a perfect name for a husky.
Hey pups!

Cute doggo, but your grandpa melts my heart, even though I don't know him

Hello nice dog. Be a good boy!
Hello Tok.
That is good doggo
Hopefully he doesn't have any Tiks
Tok took a tuk-tuk to town that took a wrong turn. Tok took over the tuk-tuk and took it to town. Tok took off and took another tuk-tuk home. This tuk-tuk took a wrong turn, too. Tok got off the tuk-tuk and took himself home. Tok took care of grandpa and grandpa took care of Tok and took off his ticks. Tok took a lick at Grandpa‚Äôs toe, and Grandpa tucked Tok in. Tok took a deep breath and took a terrific nap as time ticked on: tic-toc, tic-toc... Tok dreamt of tuk-tuks, ticks and turns.
Pic Toc banned in India
His dog was just banned from India, don't tell him.
Say hi to your grandpa for me

What else can I do?
Your grandpa has a handsome dog. Never seen a husky with a face pattern like that
fucking disgusting shits
Hi, grandpa!!!
"**Tok. (Pronounced took)".**

Ok, so the dog's name is "Took". Got it. 

While "Tok" is maybe the sound a clock makes in children's stories. "Took" is the name of the dog, is the way that word is pronounced, and is the way that name is spelled.

The name that comes out of a human mouth when speaking to this dog is "Took", which is the way the word is pronounced, and adheres to all the phonemes involved. Got it. Ok. So we're all straight ahead about this dog named "Took". "Tok" in this context, is not applicable. 

So when you meet up with your grandfather with a birthday card for "Took", that birthday card will have two o's. And when your sweet grandfather looks at the card quizzically, and says "Hey Took, look at this card, my grandson spelled your name wrong". And then you say "umm, sorry grandad oh sweet grandad, but the name coming out of everybody's mouth is "Took". According to english pronunciation rules, that's how the name is spelled". 

Then your grandfather says "listen you, I'll write you out of my will in two toks of a clock", and then you say "oh sweet grandad, I'm sorry that language is conspiring against you". And meanwhile the dog Took smiles his sweet smile, all the while waiting for the opportune moment to feast on your hot blood.
Those are such gorgeous ears!
Handsome dog
Good looking Mal!
Tok you are sweet as sugar!! I want to see you play with some toys ! Op make it happen
I love him! And he has an updoot on his snoot!
