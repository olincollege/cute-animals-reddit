Lol. Samantha and I bout to party!!!  HBD Girl!!
You better go!
DUDE THIS IS TODAY 9 HOURS LEFT, I LIVE IN BRAZIL AND NEED TO GO TO THIS BANGER PARTY, tell me, WHERE IS IT! I’m late already to cross the continent for the 11th bday of Samantha!
I would like to attend this party 🥺
On the east side of PVD! I just walked by this yesterday!! So exciting
I would love to send Samantha a birthday card and maybe a PetSmart gift card (or what ever store is suitable) is there a way I could do this?
I threw a Quinceanera birthday party for my Bernie in February. I was really hoping he'd make it to Sweet Sixteen, but he passed a month ago today. I'm glad we had that big party for him, he had fresh breath since he'd just had a dental cleaning.
Someday we will all be elderly neighbors, throwing a birthday party for our dog.

It's inevitable.
This is precious.
Samantha and I share a birthday
Please find out if people showed up.  I need to make sure the party was a success
Awe man, I'd gladly give a doggy treat if I could! Since I couldn't be there [I donated $100 to my local shelter](https://i.imgur.com/ZoLuT66.jpg)
Life goals, but for my cats.
Today is my Birthday, 11 years old

My human is throwing a PARTY I'm told!

a picture of ME on a sign on the gate,

Inviting the Neighbors & dog frens - Can't  Wait!

Doggy treats - PuPcAkEs, n Goodies for ALL

Presents, surprises! (How bout we PLAY BALL ?!)

If you're in the neighborhood, Please try n stop ^:@)

(Just Don't bring BALLOONS

cuz I Hate when they **POP**)

❤️
This makes me happy and sad at the same time as tomorrow I likely have to put my 11.5 yr old labradoodle down, she got out of the yard a little over a week ago and got into some sharp plastic, she had surgery last Sunday and had some intestine removed, she’s not doing well, refuses to eat, we put a feed tube in , fed her, 3 hrs later vomited everything up then pulled her tube out. I can’t let her suffer more.
My dog is about to turn 15 and I definitely feel like he should get a birthday party
It's less than a 90 minute drive to go to this dog's birthday party. Should I do it?!?! I just need to think of the perfect gift and not oversleep.
Missed opportunity: pupcakes
Every birthday party is a surprise party for a dog!
I was there!! Woot woot!! http://imgur.com/gallery/CD71wVf what a great doggo!!

Edit: Thank you so much for the silver!!
OP, I hope this post blows up, because then you could show your neighbor all the positivity that their awesome idea generated.  [Happy Birthday to Samantha!](https://78.media.tumblr.com/bd8318450e0a759222bdf99aece757cd/tumblr_oyulikOGqT1rrqh9xo1_500.gif)
That’s so sweet ❤️
You’re going to the party right? What are you getting Samantha as a gift?
Also, take pics for us.
Idk why but this hit me right in the feels
Ironically, a post on the front page a couple up from yours is an owner selling her 11 year old dog because she is 'tired of her'. I like this post much better
I was gonna comment “you better go” but I read the comments first and now suggest just sending a card
Do you need to bring a dog to attend? I’ll go just for the cupcakes and say hello to the birthday girl.
I’m off tomorrow.  Would’ve went 100% if I lived in that town.  Ps.: might steal this idea.
Not gonna lie, my fiancé and I looked up how long it’d take us to get to Providence!!! 2.5 hours, kind of tempted!
This is the kind of party I’d go to, and stay until 3 AM (my sleep time).
Pls leave a gift
Simon and Tuukka made it to the party!
https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/nsz62r/simon_and_tuukka_celebrate_samanthas_birthday/
I just lost my 11 year old a few days ago, I would go to this party in a heartbeat. 
I’m a chef, I make my own dog safe dog food and treats. I would cater this whole event. 
I miss my boy, he would have absolutely loved to attend. 

I always did something special for my dog on his adoption day. 
This dog deserves a special event for turning 11!
Is there any way op to get some kindof address or something, so people could send suprise dog treats? Maybe a local fed ex store or something? Imagine ol Nana getting 654 pounds of senior dog treats...help me lose all my money on this, or I am going to be so upset. I'll be OFFENDED
Why am I crying
i hope the whole neighborhood shows up
OMG! I’d love the attend this party! What doggy treats are Samantha’s favorites, and how do I attend?!?!
Samantha is the goodest girl and deserves all the birthday treats!!
Wholesome AF, wish I could attend!
I hope people will show up for the party.
Someone please bring some presents for both of them for me. And some extra good boy scritches.
This dude knows design theory
Most important: Doggo - biggest
Second most: Still doggo - of course
Third: Details outlined in red
Can we have a picture of the party ? 

I'd really like that. Hope there will be plenty of dogs everywhere...

And HB to Samantha
Send address, I’ll be there!
I have never wanted to go to a party so bad in my life 😢
I need the exact coordinates IMMEDIATELY
Happy birthday Samantha! You are a good girl yes you are!
Are you going to go ?
This party would be my “not to be missed” event  of the year! I so wish I could attend!!
This is wholesome but also kind of sad. I think they just want people to talk to. 

Getting old and outliving friends and family you were close to sucks and becomes lonely. I really hope people show up. It’ll make this persons day. I don’t want to think how they’d feel if no one showed :(
I'd attend! Who can resist doggy treats & cupcakes :)
Live long and happy lil one ! happy birthday 🎉🎂 ❤️
This absolutely belongs on the awwww page!!! Happy birthday Samantha. Awwww❤️❤️
update us on the party if you aint that busy

thx
Well it’s 12:26am June 5 happy birthday to Samantha
OP if you don't go I will be very disappointed in you.
I'd come to Samantha's party. She looks like she deserves all the best presents.
Happy birthday, Samantha!
Give her good girl pets and kisses for me from California
Where? I want me some cupcakes!!!
Maybe next time put it on your calendar.....lol
Wholesome content.
Awww please go! 😍😍😍
This is so wholesome. I also love black labs and i can never say it enough!
We would like to see pictures of tgis doggy party

2nd post pictures in rendit thanks
Where n when?!
Happy birthday Samantha! Thrive, sweet girl!
Samantha and I are birthday buddy’s! I’m so honored!
I want cupcakes..  and to pet Samantha
This is such a great idea, my friends and my families have dogs who all get along, A birthday party for dogs with dog treats just sounds fun for everyone
People must give that good girl pets on that day
Can I send treats to the puppy?
So freaking wholesome, I wish I could upvote a million times! Samantha’s a lucky lady
Oh I would so go!
this is the priority now
I hope she had a nice turnout:)
Missed opportunity to call it a pawty
Since I cannot attend in person, I would totally watch a livestream birthday party for that good old pup
Text me the addy, I’ll bring treats!
I used to look at people that did things like this with disgust. Only 30 minutes ago did I order the decorations for our pups special first birthday..... I hate myself.
I need an update!! Who went? Are there photos!? Please tell me there was a big turnout. Oh my heart...
I thought the dog had a katana in its mouth at first.
So adorable! We share the same birthday, except I’m a decade older 😂
Happy birthday to Samantha!
Happy birthday, Samantha! You’re a very good dog :)
So wholesome 😊
This is so wholesome! Please attend as my proxy and give best wishes to the owner and pets to Samantha!
This is so pure OMG
Can I come? Pleassssssse
this is so incredibly cute, i wish i could send samantha a birthday card or something 🥺
This is wholesome and sweet. 💖
This is so damn wholesome. What a great neighbor
Are we blind, deploy the happy birthday wishes
This sign wins most wholesome award
Give this dog a party that she will never forget!
Unfortunately I will be celebrating my own birthday tomorrow. But I’ll eat some chocolate since Samantha is unable to.
👏🏻Awe👏🏻some!!!
Happy birthday good pupper!!!
I'll go!! <3
My dog was born on new years eve so she thinks every year is all about her !.. which it mostly is
I want to go, I want to go!
The dogs name is Samantha! That's so fucking adorable!
Ruff ruff happy birthday day
Happy Birthday to Sam!
10 AM on a Saturday how could you miss it
AVENGERSSSSS ASSEMBLE!!
I want this to be a thing where we can all send Samantha happy birthday wishes, maybe a card etc.
can we normalize doing this pleaseeeee
I would love to see a follow up pic of Samantha celebrating with all her friends!
Ah i love this! Lol 

My cousin had a party for her dogs years ago and my dog attended lmao they had music and treats and all slept over
Today has been one of my worst days and then I see this, but now I'm crying because people are good and I wish I could go to the party.
We've finally found the answer to "who's a good girl?"
I’m introverted af but I would go to that
Please find Samantha's Amazon wish list so I can buy her a gift. 😭
 I'm gonna investigate location and where you can donate to a brotha and his dog. Don't show up becauze heart attacks are a thing.

So far we know Province Rhode Island and I am working on more charitable details.
I hope a lot of people show up. I think it would make a great story for Samantha's human to tell all her friends and family.

I hope someone attends and posts pictures of the event. I want to see all the doggies playing.
[deleted]
Any updates on how the party went??
Samantha and I share a birthday!
Where? I must know
It’s my birthday too 🥺
*doggy treats and pupcakes
Samantha
Samantha and I share birthdays! I am blessed!
I am deeply sad I cannot attend
How you throw a neighborhood party with a keg without wanting people to know you miss your 20s. Ptobably stealing this idea for my cats 2nd bday.
I wanna go! It sounds cute and fun.
You can't really go wrong with dog birthday party when there is food involved! If not, Samantha will keep you companied.
Take pictures! Tell Samantha she’s a good girl! The day will be a win.
Why does this make me want to cry... so sweet :’)
Brug I'd go to that shit
I want to attend this event so bad
that’s my birthday as well! happy birthday pupper 🥳🥳🥳
Happy birthday, Samantha.
its midnight where i am.
happy birthday sam.
I really, really, really want to know if someone or a few people go.
This is so sweet and a nice way to make new friends. I would absolutely attend with my dog if this was my neighborhood.
I usually stick to commenting on only a couple of subs, but I am 100% gonna need an update on this situation. Would absolutely attend this party if I lived nearby.
Samantha: A Barkday Story- coming next fall.
Help her celebrate!!
Not gonna lie, that's a long time for a dog party.
What’s the address, I’ll bring my dogs, party
You should drop off a gift
Anyway I can get information to send a gift? I just lost my baby 2 weeks ago and she was 10. I wish I could have got a chance to imagine and enjoy something like this with my baby when she was here.
Post that shit on NextDoor pronto
Almost 50 000 people want to wish Samantha a very happy birthday. <3
Good girl deserves all the pets and treats.
I \*need\* follow up on this. Please come back here when you get home and let us know how it went!
You better go. There is still time to hit a pet store and be a good neighbour. Bring something nice for the owner too. This dog is possibly all she has.
Me and my two want to go. They are excitedly wagging.
My dog and I would love to attend. Sadly we don’t live nearby. we will be there in spirit. If one of my neighbor posted this sweet sign. The entire neighborhood would show up. I certainly hope this lovely lady has neighbors like mine. Happy birthday beautiful girl💗🥰🐾🐾🎾🎈🎊
This reminded me of Bilbo’s 111th birthday and he also had a cute little sign on his gate. “Half the Shire’s been invited. And the other half is showing up anyway!”
What a very kind dog owner....
Awwwe that's so sweet
well that’s today for me so I’ll be sitting in my chair singing happy birthday to Samantha
If nothing else, you have to show (and maybe explain Reddit) this thread to them, and tell them that 100,000 Individual people all wanted to attend, but unfortunately some of us couldn’t make it but we all wish Samantha a very happy birthday…and please let us know how to forward a gift.
I need to know how many doggos were at the party!!
This entire thread has me feeling all warm and fuzzy. Kinda want to cry.
I live in Seattle and this is pretty common these days. Tons of us have dogs instead of kids. It's fucking amazing. We do an Easter egg hunt for the dogs every year, have birthday parties (we also have dog bars where the dogs have an indoor and outdoor play area and we can sit and drink beer. They also sell dog cupcakes /goodies there.

It's wonderful. I love my city's dog obsession hahahaha. Instead of kids on my wall, I have pictures of all my dog kids / nieces /nephews /godaughter (goddogger?)

10/10 would attend this party if it was close enough!
This is in Providence RI, near me! Sadly I lost both my elderly pups last month, so I won’t be going. But that is so sweet.
I neeeeeeed to know that this party was a success!!
This is super wholesome and just aww!
Happy Birthday Samantha
That’s the definition of wholesome
Perfection
Need an update! Did anyone show up??
Ohhh so sweet, i'd totally go to that
Do attend.
How was the party?
Can I come
Meanwhile, pretty sure there's a post in my neighboring town that is trying to sell their 11 year old dog because she went deaf. 2 types of people man. Post is pretty recent in /r/iamatotalpieceofshit dont have the sobriety to find it. This makes me feel so much fucking better though
Wish I could go
What in the Bilbo Baggins?? JK I love it. That’s adorable.
Love you man for doing this to your dog
This is so cute
I would totally go. This is too wholesome, I need to lie down.
This infuriated me when my 20-something friends did this for their dogs, but if you’re retired, you do you, man.
If you tell me where a I will try to go
Happy birthday from Oklahoma, Samantha!! 

OP should print all these messages and give them as a gift when they get home.
I want to go
This is probably an older person wanting to talk to other older people about their “baby.” It’s a cool way to get to know your neighbors! 

It’s a cool way to get to know your neighbors! I have two dogs, so I’d probably show up to that party!
So. Friggin. Sweet. 

Can’t show this to my dog, though. He turned 11 on 6/1 and we did not invite neighbors over. That said, every day is his birthday as spoiled as he is.
Samantha is 11 years old now
🎂Happy birthday Samantha... 🥳🎉🎊
*❤️❤️❤️*
***
*Please* don’t forget to send Samantha my birthday wishes.
I would love to go and celebrate Samantha’s 11th!
I love the red boxes that surround the important words.
Samantha is my birthday buddy :)
Omfg🥺 I want to go to Samantha’s birthday party!😭😭😭
Please attend. Bring people.
I'm highly invested in this. If any of you live remotely near this place, please go the party, take lots of photos and post updates!!!
Where do we send cards?
Please celebrate with them!  Thanks for sharing this
That’s fantastic
WhTs the addy
This would be the first birthday party i actually would want to go to.
Tell your neighbor to do a live feed of the party!!
"I don't care if it's over and 12 hours away mom I wanna go!"
I want to go. My pup has never been to a doggy birthday party before.
Please inform us where we can send treats to a certain address
I did this about 20 years ago for my dog. I put signs up at our usual hangouts, and a bunch of doggy friends joined us at the park to play that day. So fun.
My dog turned 11 on June 4th lol
I would totally break any engagement I already had (of which there are none), just to attend this shindig.  I absolutely love being around elderly people and it’s even better they have someone they want to celebrate!


This post warmed my cockles.
Aw this is so cute. My local dog park went all out to celebrate a puppy's first birthday. We had pizza, strawberry cake, and a lot of dogs trying to climb onto thd table.
What time? Where is the zoom link?!!!
I have learned that 11 can be old for a pup. We had two who recently fell short. If I lived in this city I would go and celebrate this precious senior.
I wanna go so badly
Address?
We need a follow up post of how the party went!
Where!!! I have a doggy I’ll love to come
/r/borkdays.

There are more dog birthday parties than you realise...
I'm not crying you are!!!!
My dog is actually turning 10 today :)
Where? I like dogs
Ok when Can i come
Samantha and I are birthday buddies :)
Awww ! Now this is my kind of neighbor !
Mmm... I would love some doggy treats and cupcakes to eat
It's amazing. But where is the address or zoom link 🔗
Come for the cupcakes, stay for the doggy treats.
My heart ♥️ 😭🥺 I can’t take it
I hope you go..I would also like to send a gift card or care package for the sweet girl happy birthday sam
[deleted]
❤️
r/borkdays would approve
Oh man I'm sooo doing this from now on!


Now to get a dog...
Please please someone go
I want to come!!
Wish i could make it 🥺
Where's the party? I wanna go
This is so lovely.
Happy birthday Samantha!
I really hope lots of people show up and post pictures for us on reddit.
I think they got the am/pm mixed up. 10 in the morning isn't exactly party time.
Damn right I'd 100% show up to that
This is, of course, adorable. But…

Anyone else slightly bothered by the inconsistency of “10AM - 2:00pm?” Both the format of the time itself AND the AM/pm? 😩😂
I would absolutely attend and bring some treats and toys for the good girl. I hope people really show up and make their day.
Sweetest thread of weekend by far. Best of health and happiness to human and canine.
Me and that dog have the same bday
that is so cute we should to do the same thing with our dogs
Wish I could pop over to celebrate Samantha from Japan 🎉
I'll be very very disappointed is nobody goes
love this - so lovely
Is that "11" or does it represent "2" in roman numerals?
"No admittance, except on party business"
Aww I hope lots of doggies and their humans show up
Happy Birthday Samantha!! I hope you have the best damn party ever and get all the treats and belly rubs a good girl could ever want!
The adorableness of this made me tear up with joy!
Ooh Happy Birthday Samantha
It's in a few minutes right? Can somebody check if there's people there? I'd feel really bad if there was no one there.
It's June 5th, which means it's Samantha's IRL cake day. HAPPY CAKE DAY SAMANTHA!!
Happy birthday Samantha
Happy birthday `Samantha, you don’t look a day over 4 ❣️🥰
*everyone liked that*
Happy birthday 🎂 🥳
june 6: *out of control party of puppies terrorize the neighbors*
This seems like a trap
Cant make the party but Happy Birthday Samantha!!  Don't party too hard or tomorrow will be ruff
What aloving pet owner. 😍
Happy Birthday!!
On my way😭😭
Your going
Ayyy its my dogs 11th birthday today too
Did they have a good turnout?
That’s today! Happy birthday, Samantha girl!
Do... do I have to eat the dog treat?
Im celebrating my birthday today too!! I'm glad I'm sharing a birthday with that doggo :))
This is exactly who I want to be when I'm old
That’s amazing
If I was invited, I'd go, bring my dog and a present. But that's just me.
AWWWW  Why is there never a doggie birthday party in my area? I would so go. I would of course inquire as to whether I could bring my doggo. She loves parties. She's part rottweiler and part sheppard and she loves to party. She just turned 8 years old last month.
Too sweet for words ☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️☺️
💕
Well, how was the party?!
Sending love and hugs to the birthday doggo!!
I wanna go!!
Happy Birthday Samantha!! You're  a good girl!!
Hope y’all had fun!
That’s awesome 
I hope he gets a lot to come that’s great!
My bad bro. Ill put the onions away
That is super cute!
Mescaline and whippets ... I'm there
If we weren't up in the Adirondacks with the in-laws then I would've loved to bring the wife and kids to this party!
Happy birthday you big perfect boy
This is cute and all but how the fuck does this have over 100k upvotes and close to 700 awards?!
guess people really are bored during this pandemic, huh?
Hope you or someone call the cops on this Karen.
Your neighbor is a selfish asshole that throws a party in the middle of a deadly pandemic!
[removed]
No one cares
I'm thinking it's a case of an excuse thought up by a lonely elderly person hoping for a visit from someone.
FUCK I MISSED IT

Edit: sorry gramps
Sam and I share a birthday and by doggie years we are nearly the same age🙂
Samantha and I have the same birthday!! Happy birthday Samantha!
Who is bringing the Scooby snacks?
Happy bday Sam!
This is so adorable...
I've missed a few of my cats birthdays but my mom, who is amazing and watches them when I'm gone, takes photos and gives them treats. The idea of people coming over for a birthday party seems so amazing, I just hope someone shows up because I feel the owner may also want the company.
I’m working! Bummer.
I am horribly allergic to dogs and I’d deal with it if I could attend this party, what a wonderful dude.
Aw man, if that was local to me, I'd be there.
Happy birthday, Samantha :)
No admittance except on party business
Ayy she and I share the same birthdate! Happy bday to her :D
Post it on the NextDoor app for that area.
I wish I ever lived in a community that was like this
Did this old man make his fortune in closets?  Does he have a much younger very attractive Colombian wife?
W H E R E
I want to go!
[It’s My Doggy’s Birthday](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LDULWCwD8co)

If you want an ear worm you won’t get out of your head
awe
They are little people in fur coats! I love it! Happy Birthday Samantha. I hope it is the BEST!
I bet this dog will have more attendees than my bday 😅my bday is also june 5.
Happy Birthday, Samantha!!!!
It’s me in the future. FYI everything is the same in the future.
I’ve wanted to have a chihuahua tea party. Someday.
awww

this warms my cold, cold heart ♥
Happy birthday Samantha!!!!!!
This is the sweetest thing I have ever seen.
God i hope i never see myself referred to as "elderly neighbor" when I throw a party.
Hell ya
Doggy bday parties can be lit. I don’t own a dog, but I really enjoyed my neighbor’s party.
It’s the please come that gets my heart.
Aw
We're in! Happy 11th Birthday to the Pups!
Please tell me somebody’s going
Gonna need that address, home-skillet. I don't miss no doggos birthday.
It's times like this I wish I had a dog so I could go to stuff like this. I like listening to stories from elderly people and I love dogs. Can't show up with any of my cats. One is too old (20) and the two other boys are bastards. The last one (princessa) is way too shy. 
Smh
We’re just in time guys!!!
Hey, thats my birthday :(
that's a respectably sized stick for such a dog.

Samantha's been putting in the work, for sure.
Bless u Samantha
Is this gonna end up being the next “Adrians Kickback?” Google it if you don’t know what I’m talking about 😂 lol
Happy birthday Samantha!!!!!!
This is so nice it makes me so happy
Bet I know their iPhone unlock code
Aw happy birthday! It’s my dog’s birthday too and they’re the same age!
What a situation!
You better go!
It's so cute....!
We can celebrate our birthday together :)
That is adorable. I would totally go!
You better attend!
Sounds like a fun person!!
That’s so cute her and I have the same birthday!
This is God damned precious. I love this man and I wish I could attend his doggos birthday party. So incredibly sweet!
Will the cupcakes be for humans or just for the dogs?
I'm booking a plane ticket as we speak 🛩 🥳
11 is the same which ever way you write it. left right up down.
Omg. This makes me want to cry 😭😭
I love people who love their dogs this much that they would have a party for them. My heart truly belongs to my girl Zoey(GSD).
My heart 🥺😍♥️
İs the dog turning 11 or 2
We are gonna need photos of the puppy party.
Now THAT is a social event I would happily attend.  I bet it's going to GO OFF!
This post is incredibly wholesome and the comments are the absolute most wholesome read ever

I would do anything to go to this and I don’t even have a dog. Look at her WITH A STICK SHE FOUND AND SHES HAVING A PARTY THROWN BY A SWEET ELDERLY MAN I CANT DEAL WITH THIS
So wholesome
These replies!  Lol!!  Reddit is great!
I want to go to Samantha’s barkday party!!
Happy birthday samantha!
Anytime for the doggy treats, love it
Happy birthday Samantha    
This may become a thing
My dog's birthday was a couple months ago. We have lots of dogs in our neighborhood, and my dog loves to sit by the door and say hi, so he has lots of doggy (and human) friends. We let people walking by with dogs know that we were going to be having a backyard birthday party for him. A good amount of people actually showed up! We grilled and smoked meats and veggies for the humans, and I made bowls of plain meat, veg, and brown rice for hungry pups, as well as treat goodie bags and doggy frozen yogurt, my dog's favorite treat. It was so much fun! All the dogs got along, and we got to hang put with some cool neighbors. Would totally do it again!
Gracious that is adorable
Is this in Oregon? Seems like Oregon for some reason.
Proper
This is the sweetest thing I’ve seen all day. I hope many human and dog friends show up for Samantha’s birthday celebration.
MY BIRTHDAY IS ON JUNE 5TH
The humbleness and simplicity of the pictures is just so cute
*loads gun* : you better go.
Awww
Everyone needs to bring pupper a toy
Happy birthday Samantha!

Wow it my birthday today to and all i have are my good friends weed and mushrooms. Turning 19 is fun yaaay.
this is the only party i’d enjoy attending
It’s an honor to share a bday with such a cute doggo!
Address, please!
Please update us on this 😀
I'm in Australia and my state doesn't allow travel yet, but i wish i could join with my dog so they could play. If anyone knows if i can send a gift card, please let me know. :)
lol today it's my birthday too!
From now on this is how I will be celebrating my dogs birthday. You're all invited!
This is so wholesome if he were my neighbor I would for sure go and bring as many people as I could find
I love that it’s clearly a template that’s been used for previous years. That must mean it’s usually successful!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SMANTHA
That’s 8 days before my birthday if anyone cared
Happy birthday Samantha!
This is beautiful
Awww I wanna go! Happy Birthday Samantha 🎂🥳
Does your neighbor reuse this sign every year? 🥺
I’d be there with my woofer if it was close
I’m in the UK or I’d come to the party myself 🥺
Cupcake is objectively the worst dessert. Halfway healthy, halfway sugar, hardly as satisfying, especially when compared to any other sweet that one can eet.

I saw that opinion on the YouTubes and found it quite riveting.
I would like to go
Let us know how it goes
Happy Birthday Samantha!
What a sweet, sweet event ❤️
Reddit shows up...
I don’t have a dog (she passed a month ago) but I’d totally wanna go!
Happy birthday sweet Samantha! We love you & send thousands of virtual pets!
Not sure i read this as “for his missing dog” but very glad i was wrong..
That's the cutest thing I've ever seen
I would 100% be there
Hey ask the guy if I can come too
I need to go to that party
You know that's gonna turn into a rager.
This is absolutely adorable. I love it! 
Please tell Samantha Happy Birthday and give her an extra belly rub from me, sweet older girl deserves it I’m sure❤️😍
Can I bring my cat?
So cute. :)

Ayyy a doggo has the same birthday as me let's goo
He has amazing penmanship

Happy birthday Samantha! Loves and kisses from Poland!
Damn I sincerely hope some people will show up. Would be heartbreaking not to see them wait with the cupcakes ready and no-one showing up. Fuckkk. Onions
I have no dog, may a attend anyways? I like dogs and people. I have neither.
Woo birthday twins

In the current pandemic times this would be called an illegal pet party in Germany
Happy birthday samantha. Hope you have a great bday today
Happy birthday Samantha!
I want the doggy treats
Fuck yeah I'd be going to that. 9/10 chance those cupcakes are the shit.
Thanks
My dogs reaching a decade old... man, is he old now? 🥺

A super soft bday party for the puppers
I am having a birthday party for my daughter that will be the same age tomorrow!
Cute
Happy birthday Samantha!
That is one of the sweetest things I’ve ever seen. Also his handwriting is on point
You best get your ass over there before it’s too late
Hey mine turns 11 June 15th!! I wish I could go but just looking at the surroundings I can tell this is nowhere near where I live
faith in humanity is restored
That is so friggin wholesome and sweet. I hope you go.
Ahh this is beyond sweet bet Samantha gets loads of visitors ahhh
Hey, that is today! Happy birthday best of puppy!
From the photo we can also tell what Samantha's job is!
🍥🎂
Awww.... I want to go. My dog, Baxter will be 6 this month. He’d love to attend.
Happy birthday Samantha!!
Awwww this is too sweet! 🥺🐶
These are the birthday parties I need to go to.
You should put a comma after the word doggy you’ll get a lot more people to come that way
Do you live in the Shire?
OP wtf you post this on June 5th? I think i can make it if I get the next flight
For doggy treats and doggy cupcakes, or for doggy treats... and cupcakes?

I'm coming either way, I just want to manage my expectations.
If nobody ends up showing up I swear I will be someone’s knee caps in
That’s cool never seen that wish I could be there
there's 2 types of parties:

1- Come at xx:xx-xx:xx for my 16th birthday and you better come with costumes at LEAST 5000$, bring me 400$ cash or a 1000$ voucher for Louis Vuitton, or a new car. MUST be a Lamborghini Aventador, and it MUST be red or you're no longer my friend

2- Come to get cupcakes and dog-shaped sweets to celebrate my dogs birthday
Happy 11th birthday Samantha
Where is it? I'll try to make it
I want to go that party 😭
The only question that remains now is: does the Dog turn 11, 3 or 2 years old?
Well thanks for the late notice, OP. How are we all supposed to get there now? Is this even in my state? Samantha is going to be so let down...
Show up or you are dead to us
Nvm i saw the comment about being out of town
I'm honoured to share my 18th birthday on the same day as Samantha's
Aye I have the same birthday, haps bthay to the dog!
Screenshotting the OP for a future day when I'm feeling awful about life and humanity and need to call up something wholesome to cheer myself up. Probably later today.
Where do old people even get that thin layer of wrinkly plastic? Literally everything in my grandma's house is covered in that stuff but I've never seen it for sale anywhere...
Dang. If I knew where this was I would show up!
I want to go!
Send a happy birthday for me plz
God bless this neighbor and the dog! I hope this dog gets all the attention and belly rubs she deserves for being a good girl!
I'm so excited to see a Reddit post of this party. I saw a couple people in the comments that live nearby and are going. This is the best thread I've ever seen on here
I’ll be there!
Happy birthday to Samantha!!!
How can someone be parallel years old?
Where so we can go ?
Tell Samantha I love her please.
Imagine being in a neighborhood with Samantha’s owner with the elderly woman who invited her neighbors to Taco Night.  I would never leave.
I'd go for the cupcakes but I would skip the doggie treats. This is adorable. You have to tell us about the turnout. I know you said you'll be out of town but I'm sure you could find out from somebody else.
omg if people don't show up I am going to cry for her 🥺
LOL!!!!!!!!!
Happy birthday Samantha!
Samsung Samantha will be 4 day old on June 5 
Just a fact
Address please? I'd like to send Samantha a card
Happy Birthday, Samantha!
Where is this. I shall go.
That's cool
that’s adorable, it also seems this sign has been used for earlier birthdays as well 😭
