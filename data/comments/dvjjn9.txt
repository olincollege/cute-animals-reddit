Im curious if it will remain the same length or grow as he grows.
Was hoping it wagged when hes happy.
Need to know. Does it stay or does it go?
Unicorn dog.... corndog?


Edit: thanks kind strangers for the awards
Unfortunately He is going to get teased by other pups at doggie daycare
r/rarepuppers
Heads or tails?

‚ÄúYes‚Äù
Looks like a cool haircut. Is there bones in it?
So is that a vestigial twin?
Such a cutie. Now when he's being a butthead it will be literal
Scientists: "Maybe we are living inside a computer simulation"  


People: "NO, we aren't, because if we were... wouldn't we notice glitches or malfunctions in the code?"  


Also People: "Check out this dog with a tail growing out of its head. Awwww."
Soon to be a eunuchorn
Narwhal, Narwhal, pup above the ocean, causing a commotion, because is so very cute.

Song aside, i hope it never causes problems and hes the best boi for a very long life!

What a little sweetheart! A literal butthead in the BEST way!!
Now I'm over here feeling like a mad scientist going "Yes, it is nonfunctional- but could we make it functional so good doggos can be twice as excited?"
I thought it was photoshopped before I read the title of your post.
Wherever he goes, he‚Äôs chasing his tail.
I hope there isn't a little butthole under that.
Reddit doggo with antenna
Too bad it's non functional. Seeing that thing wag would blow my mind.
Well, he still looks cute on it so no worries about it as long as its not harming him.
It's a Puppercorn!
I need a ton of pics of him. Such a cutie!!!
He probably absorbed one of his siblings in the womb
All hail the doggocorn!
A mutant but still so cute.
Omg a Jigglypuff puppy!
What a butthead
I think this is called ‚ÄòEd Zachary Disease‚Äô
What a great name for a cute and very unique pup!
Wouldn't it be beneficial to remove it? Couldn't it cause irritation when the dog rubs its face?
There are so many good rescues that need homes. Go out and rescue a dog tomorrow. Also please spray and neuter.

I love that Narwhal has a good home.


Edit: haha don‚Äôt spray but spay
A narwhals "horn" is actually a tooth that grows out of its mouth.
This is cute, but strange. Any insight on how this happened?
I‚Äôm really high right now. And this was the first post I see. ü§Ø
You assembled your dog poorly. Read the manual first next time.
Do you live next to a nuclear power plant, or perhaps an old bomb testing site?  Just curious.
What a beautiful pup
I just want to hug him so bad!!! He's so unique!! And fluffy!!
I WOULD NOT be able to stop petting his little tail nubbin. Adorable!
He looks like Clark Kent
Twice the wag, none of the drag
[*Annihilation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(film)) *has begun*
Consider getting it removed by a highly qualified vet. I say this because that dog will have issues at the dog park. Dogs know when something is different about another dog.  That thing will only grow bigger and be a pain in the ass later.
So remove it.
I find this puppy gross looking.
Aaaw what a cutie!
narwhals narwhals swimmin in the ocean...
He is the closest thing to a unicorn there is.
I'd teach it to walk backwards
It would be cute if it wagged but it's good its non functional because it could hurt his eyes if it hit them
I would call him "butt face."
He took the chasing-his-own-tail game a bit too far ...
Cute little butthead
How did you get this dog and how rare is this? Absolutely astonishing because I‚Äôve never seen this before.
He looks more cute with that tail
Hello Narwhal I love you
please let us know when he gets adopted!!
a perfect boi
That's the cutest lil butthead ever.
Maybe it‚Äôs like a gray hair and if you remove it two will grow back in it‚Äôs place.
Is there one in the back or has he used up his tail allowance?
Yeah yeah, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcute‚Äù or whatever. But does it poop out of the mouth?
Just wondering, was there a puppy in the litter missing a tail?
His doggy friend are going to sniff his face to tease him üòÇüòÇ
He looks cute though
He‚Äôs just got a lil flappy doodle on his head
I hope it doesn‚Äôt grow too long. 

Also

I hope it grows to full length.
Does he have a normal tail?
And other dogs won't care, the dog world is an accepting place
Surprised they haven't removed it considering it's not attached to anything life threatening. It is normal amongst arse holes to cut the actual tails from dogs afterall.

I wonder whether he partially absorbed a twin in the womb to get it.
If all else I'd train the dog to walk backwards.
Is there a tiny cute little butthole underneath it?
cute but also wierd af
Looks like good boi here cannibalized a sibling in the womb.
Where did you catch this pokemon?
Cool, so snip snip then
[link to article about this dog](https://komonews.com/news/offbeat/rescue-discovers-unicorn-puppy-with-tail-growing-from-forehead)
So... remove it?
Take it off? Don‚Äôt celebrate these mutations.
I feel sad about him. Nothing cute there, this is an illness.
Could it be a twin that didn‚Äôt form right?
That's rather...odd.
So cute!  If he was born maybe 7 or so years back, he'd have instantly become a reddit sensation, and the unofficial mascot of the site.  Are you familiar with reddit's (former, I guess) obsession with narwhals?
Fucking gross
That's super gross
He had a brother in the womb. 

Too bad for his brother that he was weak sauce and got consumed.
Sure is a funny little fella
Give him glasses and call him Bark Kent
Thank you for your interest in Narwhal! He resides at a rescue who by their own words "specialize in special". They help mostly dogs with special medical needs.

Mac's Mission rescue began in 2011 with a pitbull named Mac who was in horrible shape when they found him, but now thrives. 

Narwhal is one of their latest rescues. He is very happy and playful. 

You can find more pics and videos of Narwhal and all of his friends on a couple of the more popular social sites by searching MacthePitull.

Thanks again!
Does he have a little face on his butt
Omg I saw both of your post right below each other
Great name for this little angel!
That‚Äôs the world‚Äôs most amazing name for him.
I love you Narwhal
He's gonna have a hell of a time catching that one.
Cute 'lil mutant!
Will it grow and become in hinderance to him later ? 
He is suuuuuper cute !!
Let him know that I would die for him
Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool if he could wiggle it when he was happy?
Aww he so cuteüíú
I know it's non functional but it would be cute if it could wag.
I first thought pupper had a fuzzy caterpillar on his noggin till I read the title. He‚Äôs such a cutie and Narwhal is a perfect name.
When he goes to sniff some.dog bootyx the bitch gets a surprise
Awww.
OMG love the name does he have feeling in it? soooo cute
Your dog absorbed another dog, but not quite.
I hope in the future it gains a bone or 2 and is able to wag when his real tail does also.
Saw an article that called it his ‚Äúface tail‚Äù and it made my day.
aww I was hoping for facewags
Lookin like the dude from Hey Arnold
Catdog
Causing a commotion because he is so awesome
does it wag?

How the fuck does that happen
It's a Unicorn Puppy!
Doggocorn!
He's a unicorn
How ? Thats so weird how thats possible.
Thoughts on getting it removed?
Like the name it suits him
THATS SO CURE OMYGOD I NEED HIM SO MUCH
It makes him unique ... I like it üíôüê∂ and naming him Narwhal oh my gosh I LOVE IT!!!!!
Now that's a r/rarepupper!

Edit, sorry, it's r/rarepuppers!
I‚Äôm so uncomfortable rn.
a true rare pupper!! r/rarepuppers would love this
Need a video!
I just saw this pup on a vet tech group that I‚Äôm part of! We were all curious if the pup has bones near the base of the tail. Scientifically I‚Äôm super interested in the dog, Emotionally I‚Äôm in awe of how cute this kid is.
Are you adopting this pup?
This is literally the most perfect dog that has ever existed
üòçüòçüòç
That‚Äôs so cute!
Does he also have a standard tail?
Destined to be so happy he got two tails :)
I need to see updates in few years
That's just a bang /s
FLOPPY BANANA!
omg he's so cute!
I would like more photos
R/rarepuppers
Will it continue to grow?
Which tail will he chase?
Please show pictures when he gets older!!
I would call him TAILOR.
Is that Updog?
This looks so crazy. I hope he can wiggle it.
I say have them remove it. It's going to be uncomfortable for the pup in the long run. Healing time can't be that long.
Two questions of great importance:

A. Will the tail get longer into a full grown monster tail?

B. Does it still have a tail coming out of its butt?
"nonfunctional"

He was this close to having his own little doggy windshield wiper.
So, is it anatomically a tail? Like with little vertebrae inside and everything? Or is it a fleshy thing?
Causing a commotion, cause he is so awesome?
Send us a video of it wagging!
Flaccid unicorn
I wonder if it gives him hard time socializing :( I hope for the best boi whatever happens to him!
My little sister wants Narwhal to know he's an adorable irl unicorn.
Precious little mutant
I bet r/rarepuppers would love this little guy :)
I will adopt this dog right now and pay for all expenses to pick it up and give it an amazing loving home. Is it available for adoption?
Awwwwhhh he can be double excited!
I‚Äôve seen enough horror movies to see where this is going
Could they not just remove it... if it‚Äôs still growing I feel removing it now while he‚Äôs young before it could potentially cause problems in the future
Dogicorn! üê∂
I am so very glad he wasn't named Butthead.
Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.
So, does doggo have an actual fully functioning tail at the correct end? Or just one misplaced tail?
u/schnoodledoodledo where you at. This pup needs a poem.
And y‚Äôall hate GMO‚Äôs...
don't see that every day
THAT IS ADORABLE! YOU COULD STYLE THAT IN SO MANY WAYS.
This is how Evolution happens
Please breed him to make unicorn dogs real.
Poor baby
It's unfair how if a puppy has a tail on his face he's possibly even more adorable and perfect, but if I have a bit of butt growing on my face I'm horrific and ugly.
Perfect name for that little cutie.
But how? Anatomically that makes no sense. It can't be "a tail" can it? A tail is the end of the spine? This is not a part of the spine? How can there be a piece of spine on the forehead? Is that a thing that happens in other animals? Is your dog the only reported mammal with that case? Why isn't he getting studied by fetal development specialists? Is this like in movies when people find a dog with the ability to talk and refuse to hand him to scientists so that he doesn't become a lab animal? (Cue joke about him looking like a Labrador.)
Can someone confirm whether or not this is actually real? I want to share this but I'm hesitant because of my scepticism.
Because what the fuck else would you name him?
This is my favorite dog now.
THAT IS PRECIOUS!
Would be a little freaky/cute/funny if it wagged whenever he‚Äôs happy
Official doggo of The Misfits.
Ngl looks like someone put a slice of poop on his head.

Still cute tho
Is it possible to remove the tail smh?
He is a  PUPPERCORN OR PUPPYCORN - not to be confused with a ü¶Ñ unicorn.
Take it off
Will the trail grow over time?
r/awwtf

But good to see he's got a loving family
causing a commotion because he is so awesome
Imagine that waggin at full speed blinding this cute little doggo
Oh wow
Quick! Check if there a face in the butt
Shoulda named him unicorn but still really cute though!!!!
That‚Äôs a very strange mutation. Wouldn‚Äôt this puppy be at risk for many other genetic problems?
Does it wag?!
I'm sorry but is no one going to mention Jigglypuff? Very disappointed.
Cute. In a fallout kind of way. But still.
Does he still have other tail
Are you gonna get it snipped off? I think it might bug him once he gets older
I would have called him Danzig.
Homie definitely ate one of his siblings in the womb. The rest probably lives in his brain.
Is it bad that i'm kinda bummed someone has already adopted him?  I want a furry narwhal.
That's ruff
I think your narwahl has something wrong with it. It looks like a dog.
HE'S A UNICORN OMGOMGOMGOMG
That's the Superman Curl!
Poor thing..... Could always call it his cowlick....
If dogs were unicorns.
Drosophila is that you?
What a butthead
permanent caterpillar friend
Imagine how cute it‚Äôd be if his little head tail started wagging!! üò≠üíñ
I could not imagine a more perfect name for him
r/rarepuppers
Doggo-Ponny
I would have called him "Tailhead"
....does it wag? I wanna see it wag
There was a little girl with a little curl right in the middle of her forehead.
When she was good she was very very good
But when she was bad she was horrid
Lmao name checks out
Now this is a cute little mutant
So, (fun) fact, the narwhal horn is actually a tooth that grows disproportionally and in a weird form. It actually pierces the flesh of the whale.
The males also duel with them, because why not?
Nonfunctional means it doesn't do anything, including wag.
As someone who works at an animal hospital, it looks like you took a puppy tail from a tail docking and placed it on his face to trick stupid internet people.
My friend you have something more rare than a unicorn, you have a doggo-corn.
That‚Äôs a great picture.  How did he get his name?
You got a Unidog. Or a Dogicorn.
He must have absorbed his sister in the womb, now he has the strength of a full grown dog, AND a tiny puppy
DNA OVERFLOW
he is a puppycorn !!!!
I would die for him.
The only part of his twin that survived
It's a puppycorn
Does it wag?
Does he have a head coming out of his ass?
I live near this place! Here‚Äôs more photos and a story by the local newspaper.

Assface
If he was born in India he‚Äôd probably be crowned a deity and worshipped and you‚Äôd make bank $$
He absorbed another pupper in the uterus. That's the left over tail of his sister or brother... Look closer, look into his eyes -- he's a killer and pure evil.
This his gross,
Idk why but I gagged
He ate his twin in the womb
If he falls down, does he land heads or tails?
He ate one of his brothers
r/TIHI
Might be the wrong sub for this
Genetic defects are not cute
Ick! Cut it off!
[deleted]
‚úÇÔ∏è
Why not get it removed. How would you feel with an extra tail growing from your head? Lol.
Well that's fucking vile...
Welp, its fucked. better put it down.
it's a unitail
So remove it
Is it actually a tail or just a growth that looks like one?

Just tell people it's his superman curl
r/blursedimages
Hi this is my dog ass face
I feel like they should remove it now rather then later? What if it grows to its larger size. Poor dogo
Oh come on people. This is a bad photoshop...
Imagine your butt growing on your forehead.
Repost, fucking word for word, one hour later. Are you kidding me.
I would have named him Butthead but to each his own.
So you‚Äôre just going to post the pup all over reddit for karma but not even mention the rescue he‚Äôs with so people can go see other adoptable animals or donate? That‚Äôs really awesome of you!
Aww deformities. How cute/s
This is fucking disgusting
burn it with fire
Yuk. Please have it removed.
It‚Äôs a curiosity and kind of cute, but I wouldn‚Äôt risk it and would talk to a vet and explore the possibilities of removal. Now that the little guy is small and has found loving partners, he will be ok and healing of such small wound should not take longer than 2-3 weeks.
Please don‚Äôt let it breed
And here I thought the bunny outside my window at work would be the cutest thing I saw today.
what a sweet hunnie :)
Nard dog best boy!
Built-In Wind Shield Wiper
Full body tail wags are his superpower.
¬π111
You're going to end up calling him Wally
Can he wag it?
He's a narwhoof. So cute!
What a cute little butthead
narwhal üò≠ they're like an underwater unicorn, they got a kick-ass facial horn, they're the Jedi of the sea
Narwhal is the freaking cutest name possible for him.
asshead
He‚Äôs adorable üòç
When he's naughty you can call him Butthead.
Unipups
Wow, that is incredibly unique. That's one awesome name for him too!
Oh man his Instagram is gonna be huge
He‚Äôs perfect! What a beautiful baby
Does he still have his regular dog tail?
It's a uni-pupper!!  So adorable!
Nice job, evolution. At least you tried.
Now, he is the very definition of a rare pupper
is he coming or going?
Awww unique lovely little boye. I can‚Äôt... those eyes <3
Keep posting his photos as he grows up.  I want to follow him!
Do you think it will continue to grow?
r/rarepuppers
This dog needs an IG page of his own üòÅ
Boy, is he gonna get picked on in school!
what a sweetie!
Ive actually never heard of a tail growing out the head of a dog before. Such a cute way to be unique sweet pupper!!
r/mildlyinteresting
perfect name.
I need him
Is it also spine inside like normal tail or just skin ?
the name is so perfect I love it
I'd definitely be calling him Nar Nar.
Aww! He's really cool!
This might be a dumb question but... will it grow as he grows?
Cute little butthead
Unicorn
HES A BUM HEAD HAHAHAHA little baby, so cute
Not to be dramatic or anything *but* I‚Äôd die for Narwhal.
I want too see this pupper in a couple of months when he's all grown up! Will the tail grow as well?
poor cutie.
Will it grow longer? Does he have a normal functioning tail?
Does it wag?
Not going to read all the comments to see if this came up, but I want to say that tail is also about the only thing in that part of my anatomy.
I love Narwhal and his teeny tiny adorable tail. Glad it's not life threatening. He's so cute üíôüíôüíô
Oh my goodness! He is so cute! That little tail üôàüòç
You know what it is attached to though?
Awwww
You should post this in r/rarepuppers
I wouldn‚Äôt even think of it as a tail; it just looks like a tuft of emo hair, lul
Can it wag?
u/adcd57 omg how different
Oh he is precious ... this lil narwhal üíôüê∂
r/mildlyinteresting
11/10 for your name choice.
Sweetie
Love the name! What a cutie! 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcYVCvBq0FY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcYVCvBq0FY)
does it shit out of its' nose or mouth?
What a big silly!  I love him!
Please hand pupper over :')
What if other dogs try to be playful by pulling on it? How sensitive is it?
It looks like a cute delinquent from the 80‚Äôs
DOES IT WAG WHEN HES HAPPY
Does it wag?
I know this is going to sound stupid but I really don't know how to phrase it...

Is this like when a fetus "swallows" the other and then is born with a "remain" of the other?
Is he a good Boi?
Did a double take because I read /r/aww but my reaction was more /r/WTF ....but he's a cutie.
Lovely name!
Wait, that's illegal
Whoa this is so neat! glad it‚Äôs not attached to anything life threatening!
So, this little tail is not wiggling simultaneously? At all, never ever?
r/rarepuppers
Missed an opportunity to call him Narwoof.
does it....wag?
DOES IT WAG?!?!
What breed is he? he‚Äôs beautiful
Not to be insensitive, but does the front tail wag?
Accurate name
I don‚Äôt think removing dew claws at birth is cosmetic.   They are hard to clip and if ignored can grow into the dog‚Äôs leg.  They serve no purpose and are a pain.  Removing at birth is very easy and certainly not traumatic to the pups.
Wait it‚Äôs not a tumor or anything right?
It looks like that little Superman curl.
Breed him and create a new breed of unicorn doggos
Does it wag?
I love Narwhal!
Can he wiggle it üòÖ
Wait, does it move?
That dogs heads up it ass 

Taxi!
What about when he gets older? Does it stay small or will it droop over his face?
I need more information.
Only the chosen one can prevent the rainicorn/dog wars
The real question is, does it wag?
Does he have a forehead where his tail should be?
Does it wag?!
Is this fake? Someone show me other cases of this! I want x-rays! This shit is bananas!
I love the name
Does his headtail have little tail bones?
Can he wag it?
Absorbed sibling?
The intersection of r/aww and r/wtf is a strange and wonderful place.
You should post this in r/rarepuppers
‚ÄúMutie!!‚Äù
The only thing better than having a tail to chase is having two tails to chase.
He has an ahoge. He's the next Danganronpa protagonist.
I was wondering if this was possible and there it is. Thanks random reddit feed!
Will it grow with him? Or stay small?
imagine if it wagged
r/PiratePets ?
Does it wag?!
I lot it but how can that happen
Cutie ‚ô°
Does if wag when hes excited ?
Wait how is this possible :0
Does he have a functional tail in the usual place?
Awww!  It's so weird that it's cute!  Does he have a normal tail on the other end?  He's so adorable!
I would have also accepted Clark Kent
Oh my gawd you just made my day!
Missed opportunity to name him Charlie!
We have a weenie dog and when he gets cold he likes it when we ask him is he a chili/chilly dog. Then when he gets hot then he is a hot dog
Ida called him Turkey cause well kinda reminds me of the thing a Tom Turkey has hanging off its beak.
It looks like he has flicks going on over there
Is this the same dog from the other day?
Does he ever chase it?
What an adorable little freak!
Is this the dog version of an Angler Fish that feeds on cats?
If it wags it'll be useful as a windshield wiper for his eyes.
He's a little bit adorable
Aww! My kid was born without arms. We named him Stubby.
If he has a snout coming off of his ass then he‚Äôs a palindrome.
So cute! It's a ahoge!
How freaky would it be if it was functioning. Like it wagged when he got excited.
Does he still have a normal tail?
What if it grows just like Pinocchio
That is *nuts*
You serious Clark?
I thought it was poop lmao
It actually is the same dog
This is fascinating. How does this happen? Random mutation?
you can call him butthead when he's being naughty
Do you think this is an absorbed twin situation?
If the tail is long enough you can make him a samurai mustache lol
luke says hi.
‚ÄúThere goes a Narwhal!‚Äù - Fred Schneider
His horn is flacid
I met this awesome lil Narwhal tonight. I volunteer for Macs Mission. He is absolutely perfect! Check us out at macsmission.org
Get him one of those pig ears.  I promise you, that shit going to waggle.
Is he a butthead?
Cute
But does it WAG
Breed = unicorn
Butthead
What a handsome young boy.
Is it giving a cowlick on his forehead too??
I don't know Narwhal but I love him.
Unipup
The construction cells mixed up the blue prints
Does he have a tail in the back too?!
What a coincidence, i‚Äôm using the Narwhal app to read about a dog named Narwhal :))
Real question that maybe only a vet can answer... does this mean Narwhal are one of his sibling in womb?
So ur telling me a unicorn fucked a dog...what!?!
Pretty sure it's a tooth.
An unicorn? ü§îü§î
Play it as it lies.
Mac's Mission?
> not attached to anything life threatening.

besides that deadly cute face.
You missed a perfect opportunity to use the name Lelu(Leelu?) From futurama
Is it supposed to get bigger as he grows?
WAMUU!)
I love him üò≠üò≠üò≠
This is adorable
he's a unicorn!
What a great fucking name... a lesser being would have called him pegasus.
What's the breed of your pupper?
What if the dog attacks someone to the point there life is threatened. Then the tail is attached to something life threatening
Does anyone have a solid theory on how this happened? Did this dog absorb his twin in utero or something? Just curious as to the theories.
Flaccid unicorn
rare pupper.

Also does it wag?
Is he a dachshund? ü•∞
Cute dog but wtf
A dog with a cowslick
Cute
Aweeee I love him AHHHHHHH
This has to be the final form of r/rarepuppers
Unicorns are real!
This dog is it‚Äôs own hormone monster
Unicooorn
Butt does it wag??
I'd have gone with Leelu for a name.
Does it work? Like, does it also wag? Can we just admire that this doggo comes with a windscreen wiper?
Great name. I thought sbarkles would be the best possible name for all dogs but now I see it should be a name that recognizes what is special about the dog.
Looks like baby hair.
What a unique doggo
Is it better to get it removed? So that it doesn‚Äôt get caught on anything or when other dogs are playing with him in case they pull it. We ended up removing our dog‚Äôs high back toes (idk the term) but they grow far up his leg and don‚Äôt serve a function or have a bone in em, they‚Äôre just a risk for infection if he was to get them caught and tear them.

Anyways. Mumbo jumbo aside, I love the tail and your dog is cute as heck.
Super man
This internet dog needs regular updates! You better be a good doggie Parent!
That is one cute little butt face
Take him to India theyll be all over it
Remind me 365 days
Cut that shit
What an absolute good boy!
Does it wag when he is excited?
I sincerely hope you post a new picture of him every month or something. I'd love to see what he looks like when he's older
So he must poop out his mouth
Thats so cute. And now I know its possible for animals to grow more traits
Does he have 2 tails or only that one?
It kinda reminds me of the weird hair that would stick out in animes
Cute Windermere breed
licorndog
this is freaking me out more than it probably should...
Aww it‚Äôs like an antenna lol
.....ITS THE UNICORN PUPPY... I am sad it cannot wag is horn, it would be both fucking hysterical and adorable - not to mention no dog could replicate him
NAWhal-cause he‚Äôs a dog and can chew on stuff. NAWhal
I love the dog‚Äôs name.
The cuddliest narwhal.
but he still so adorable
Cute doggo and great name
RemindMe! 365 days
Narwhal

Doo do do doo dododododo

Narwhal 

Doo do do doo dododododo

Right off the bat I have a present for you. What can you tell me about tails growing out of your head?
If this isn‚Äôt removed, will it stay the size it is today or grow as the puppy does?
Remindme! 1 month
You are the unique one!
a unicorn doggo!
Assface
Absorbed his womb mate.
Please tell me you named him Unicorn

EDIT: I'm blind and didn't read the title. Narwhal is an even better name.
If it grow on his head like that then what happend at his back ? Do he have a second tail ?
I like things that have one thing instead of 2 things.
He is soo special! Thank you for giving him a loving home!
That's gnarly.
Ummm. I love him.
It me
This would make a great insult... ‚Äòyou spend so much time with your head up your ass your face grew a tail‚Äô obviously it doesn‚Äôt apply to this wittle pupperss, he‚Äôs a good boiii.
I love his name!  Now I‚Äôm going to YouTube to listen to ‚ÄúNarwhal Eating a Bagel‚Äù.
He‚Äôs a unicorn !
He‚Äôs gonna get confused when he chases his tail
Chernobyl doggo
Narwhal?  I would have named him Butt-Head.
I could have sworn I saw this on Futurama.
Ma'am thats a doggo unicorn. 10/10 would still give kisses
Does this make him a butthead?
Your dog has an ahoge, it is now a main character in an anime somewhere.
just when you think you‚Äôve seen it all
Okay, that's the cutest damm thing I've seen all day. 

Heckin good boy
Literal butthead?
He can catch his trial with ease now
One hell of a cowlick!
Chimerism?
Does it mess with his vision?
Will it continue growing as he does ?
Don‚Äôt get him to excited he‚Äôs going to fucking blind himself. 


You have to master the excitement.
Fuck... I just had a headache looking at it
Omg if it wags...üòçüêï
It‚Äôs a unicorn dog hybrid
Narwhal.

Perfect.
Does it wag when he‚Äôs exited?
To take a question from bill wurtz how did this happen
UniPuppy
Butthead

So was there an unborn twin or something? Also great name choice lol.
Evolution still exists
Nice
Narwhal is the perfect name he is so cute.
Who said unicorns don't exist!
Great name choice.  I would likely do nothing so long as his quality of life isn‚Äôt jeopardized.
You should buy another one like this on the dark web and work to make this a full blown breed!!!

Hello friend :)

Don't bother him, that's just his superman curl
Its a puppercorn
looks like a claw or a shark tooth.
But, does his breath smell like shit?
