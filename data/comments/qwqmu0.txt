Little friend absolutely nailed it!
"the fuck man where'd my lunch go"
Just for some context... Wildlife expert Chris Packham and a tortoise named Charles Darwin opening a science laboratory at the University of Lincoln in 2015.
This is adorable. Now hopefully they gave him some of that sweet sweet greenage.
"University of they're here"
I was expecting him to take way longer and for that guy to have to just awkwardly hold him there for like five minutes.
This is some Fred Flintstone shit
It‚Äôs appropriate as the tortoise was a major donor.  He shelled out big bucks!
Eyyyy, I studied there!
OK, new law needed to make this the only way to open new buildings.
"Consider the tortoise."
"Goodbye first-rate education. Hello University of Lincoln."
My tortoise is shy and does not like to eat in front of people. She would be watching us all suspiciously and everyone would have to turn around before she would bite the lettuce.
/r/turtleswithjobs
makes you proud to be British
Clever cuteness üòÅ
I study in this building! (Forensic science, year 1) 
It‚Äôs the Joseph banks laboratory
This feels like a TomSka sketch that went too far and became real...
I can‚Äôt believe how good that worked
[The University of Lincoln ](https://youtu.be/O5fzmmrk6kk)
I live in Lincoln and had no idea this happened. 

That's adorable.
...but...he hungry tho...
The hare didn't make it
They have used him as a scissor.
I fucking love tortoises. My fianc√© and I have three that live in our backyard. They‚Äôre super cool and are a great way to dispose of fruit that will be too ripe soon.
MY HOME CITY ON THE FRONT PAGE THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME
I love this! I have a tiny baby sulcata tortoise and as soon as any leafy green gets anywhere near his/her face they start chomping away. Half the time missing and just biting air because it gets overly excited. 

Fun fact about tortoises: they don‚Äôt have visible genitalia so it‚Äôs impossible to tell their gender by inspection until they are around 4-5 yrs old when they are fully developed and their shells start to look different. 

Owners often try to use unisex names for that reason but it‚Äôs pretty common for someone to be sure their tortoise is male and end up female, so they have a lady tortoise walking around named Harold.
Chris Packham is such a nice bloke, his wildlife shows have been great watching over the years.
I went to UoL and I completely forgot this happened üòÇ
That was the cutest ribbon cutting ceremony I have ever witnessed <3
[With sound](https://youtu.be/n_1nafOPEZU)
Chris Packham, a national treasure.
Look, that tortoise donated 20 million dollars to the university; you better believe he insisted on the ribbon cutting.
I hope he got paid for his work and public appearance! /s
I like turtles.
This is something Gavin Belson would do
r/feedthedamntortoise
‚ÄúHey yo, where the fuck did my food go?!‚Äù

‚Äî that turtle
This is really creative.
The guy can‚Äôt believe that worked.
ok, gotta hand it to you, that was pretty cute, *serotonin ADQUIRED*
The tortoise now legally owns that building.
*chomp*
Are these some kind of eco-friendly scissors?
Damn, I'll be going to university of Lincoln soon
"New"
Man has a job to do and is all about it. Let‚Äôs have turtles at all opening Ceremonies!
That tortoise is going to outlive some students
Imagine getting a tortoise picked over you to do the ribbon cutting. üòÇ
Then imagine being asked to hold the tortoise for the ribbon cutting. üòÇ
Pretty cool idea though.
Ahh, I live here!

Lincolnshire that is.
![gif](giphy|tJMHfE1mF0I0jU4h9s|downsized)
*Turtle was a paid actor*
Mayor Tortimer
I do *not* want to watch this guy launch a ship.
He has major Michael vibes
"hey enough for today, I'm tired gonna take rest for a week now"
Amazing
cool
Shell of approval
Just Donatello things
Scissors must never be used again!
I'm the guy kneeling down filming in the white shirt...we we're so glad the tortoise played ball. üòÖ
I'm sure this guy is perfectly nice, but he looks like the villain in a Christmas movie.
I went to the University of Lincoln.

It was shit.

Nice cathederal though.
Why is Mitch McConnell in r/aww?
No one is concerned for the turtle in the hands of the science lab? Is he their pet or a project?
Excellent job, tortoise
Single normal hungry Turtle
'Where did my lunch go!!!???'
All Hail!
Queen now scheming to send out the corgis.

No one takes her bread and butter away from her.
Ok, this is how every ribbon-cutting of every new thing should be conducted now, via tortoise.
I see a /r/wallstreetbets meme coming from this
Alternate title: Man substitutes tortoise for scissors to open new science lab at UoL
What is the tortoise‚Äôs name?! We need answers
"Professor Turquoise, if you would do the honors"
Prof. Turquoise: *tortoise noises*
*looks at camera and shrugs* It‚Äôs a living
Wow. This is ridiculous
[deleted]
And now, for the grand opening! Bring forth the Tortoise!
Using Flintstone's technology for opening a modern science lab.
he be like give my damn food back bitch
To further the understanding and defence against the man eating swans.
https://youtu.be/24zAybnk8cY
He‚Äôs like, ‚Äúyo where tf did my leaves go?‚Äù
why so slow
Go chompy boi go
This is making me wonder if the inventor of scissors was watching turtles carefully.
let him eat the greens though, what a tease
Is that Gavin Belson?
Next week‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúScience lab opening tortoise‚Äù
Damn, didn't expect to see Lincoln on reddit today
Hopefully he won't end up in a lab....
That tortoise has done more with his life then I have. üò¢üòÇ
Now give him more lettuce!
This looks like a scene out of the office with the diagonal pan to the unimpressive crowd lol
Noice üòé
This fills me with genuine delight and glee!
Damn hes hungry put it back
I love that someone thought of this and carried it out to fruition.
I have lived in Lincoln all my life. How have I not known about this??
GO HOME DINOSAURS!!
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen.
After opening the tortoise was used as a Lab Rat
At first I thought the guy was a Lincoln cosplayer
Might have been new at the time, but this happened in 2015.
[removed]
Took forever. Should of used the hare
This is genius
Love the little "Mlem" after cutting it üòÇ
He did such a great job.
I‚Äôm on my third year here and I never heard of a tortoise opening one our buildings lmao. My friend studies forensic science so I‚Äôm sure she has classes there. She also likes animals so I‚Äôm sure this will put a smile on her face! Thank you!
great idea, ill get a tort to open some things for me now, like condom packages etc. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
it is great
I'm gonna use that little guy to cut some tails
Wait.. was that Raphael from teenage mutant ninja  turtles?
lol
Why is that, Leon?
Crazy part of this, is the fact the turtle is going to outlive that guy and possibly that building.
#C H O R M P
I love this! So cute. Hope he got some more treats after a hard day at work.
That tortoise thought it was going to get to eat all that lettuce and was immediately denied
Awwww
That's awesome lol

Seeing Chris Packham there reminds me, i wonder when the next series of Winterwatch starts
Yo, what? My fucking lunch, Jo??? The fuck you trying to pull
r/turtleswithjobs
Yay for torty
That's very creative
I thought the man was putting the tortoise in a catapult at first.
This is Nebraska not Maryland!
He has spoken.
Love it!
hahaha this is amazing

morning starting off great :)
This. This is hard hitting journalism and I completely support it.
This reminds me very much of the [Flintstones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flintstones).
that was a 10/10 CHOMP
‰πåÈæüÔºöËøôÊòØ‰∫∫Âπ≤ÁöÑ‰∫ãÔºü
Congratortlation
mfw when i see a place on popular that's in my region
ü•∫
Not the band? üòù
But...why?
There's an episode of "Wait Wait Don't Tell Me" where Maeve Higgins pronounces tortoise as "tor toys" the whole time and that is how I have read it in my head ever since.
Love the uni of Lincoln ‚ù§Ô∏è
wait i study here
they‚Äôre evolving
Why the fuck is the video not playing and I‚Äôm getting a black screen
Hey I go to uni here! That's the last thing I expected on the front page
Couldn't happen to a nicer reptile
What a legend.
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen
and they are reusable :)

`"What did the VIP say?" "CHOMP!"`
Thought it was another gender reveal..
I like to imagine he shouts "YEA!" at the end.
Is that Chris Packham?
Lifting a tortoise 5 feet above asphalt or concrete doesn't seem like a great idea.
Oh my god that‚Äôs cute as shit.
10/10
They baited him so hard
The way he held the turtle up after for pictures lol
I open.
I like turtles.
Looks like Gavin Belson launching the box 4
Why does my stupid mind thought I would see mutant ninja turtles clapping while it zooms out. And why am I disappointted when its not.
When you're high AF, but still need to finish the work
I love this and all, but also.. what the fuck? Nobody questioned this idea?
This is so perfect.
He‚Äôs like um I‚Äôm still hungry‚Ä¶
No animals were hurt in the making of this
Now gibe him a wittle hat and make him mayor :3
What an absolute unit
r/animalsbeingbros
would‚Äôve been better if the tortoise weren‚Äôt hungry and the principle had to bite through a bit of shit stringy lettuce or wave a limp finger at it to break it, not gonna lie
Anyone else halfway expect the Dr to spike the tortoise upon completion?
I was waiting for a Flintstones moment where the turtle breaks the fourth wall by facing the camera and saying something like ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs a living!‚Äù
That is adorable and that tortoise deserves to have a good life
They do turtle experiments there? Wonder if he‚Äôs test subject #1 lol
Haha I just graduated from the University of Lincoln this summer

Nice tortoise
It‚Äôs cool but I feel like I see this on front page like once a month. Lol
Gavin Belson??
üåü Everyone liked that üåü
Wholesome realness
This was such a dumb idea that executed brilliantly. Genius!
I bet the hare is taking a long, hard look at it‚Äôs life right now
Good thing the tortoise was hungry üåû
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all week
oh boy
r/turtleswithjobs
lol i studied and graduated here, this sums the place up
He is a professional
He's a thousand times better then a pair of scissors
This tortoise has zero idea in life that it‚Äôs been upvoted so many times for this video.
Would've been awkward if it hadn't worked
Cute
yes, this is absolutely the content i signed up for.
What a cool turtle
Ummm is this in the UK?
He was then taken apart piece by piece in the name of science.
Nature‚Äôs scissors. Let‚Äôs do this for all opening ceremonies, but different animals for flair!
The way it zoomed out made this look like a clip from the office
I go to this Uni :)
*nom*

‚ÄúHello!‚Äù

*explodes*
Good to know my money was put to good use
Dude just wanted sum lettuce
I feel like there‚Äôs a joke to be made about him winning the race
If any animal that deserves the honour of opening a science lab, it's mice!
University of Maryland should do this.
Omg so proud of him
Look the first test subject
Turtle is the lead scientist
NOM
This should be how all ribbon cutting ceremonies are conducted. Scissors are lame, tortoises are way better.
Tortoise is like, ‚Äúyou gonna pick that shit up or just stand around celebrating that I dropped my food like assholes?‚Äù
Now we know why science isn't making any progress.
Gotta love Chris Packham.
So cute!
Little friend nailed it!
Genius
This is the best thing I've seen all year
This is Peak Aww
Please work, please work, please work.. YES!
Feels like this could've been in the show Portlandia

I enjoy this video ü•∞
I live in Lincoln, I knew this place was being opened but not by a cute tortoise! I definitely would of gone to the opening if I knew this
Wow
I gotta do this with my Donatello
For a second I thought this was a Gavin Belson clip
la verdad bastante humilde esa tortuga y un ejemplo a seguir
I never get an applause when I stuff my face, just judgemental looks.
Ohhh my lanta, this made my day, so cute! That poor turtle just like "Oh, food! Ah, what?!"
This tortoise has accomplished more than I have in my 30 years of life
Lol i love it
So cute
My University was a joke... They would have used the swans but they are unsociable ass holes.
"I will fuck your UCAS application up. Good bye first class education, hello University of Lincoln"

\- approximately
In this case it's pronounced tore-toys
This.  This why I come to Reddit.
Professor Wrinkleneck opens all of his labs in person
the best and should be the only way to do ribbon cutting ceremonies
My girlfriend is going to absolutely love this.
I can't see Lincoln without thinking of TomSka's first truly viral sketch video.
‚Äú hey can I get my pet  tortoise to , you know , cut the ribbon . ‚Äú
This was my Uni! Loved it there
Gotta love Chris Packham.....great bloke.
"Where lettuce?" - Turtle
Eita!
This looks like a scene from parks a rec
I can't even express how cute this turtle is
Everyone liked that
A new standard has been set.
Tortoise getting paid
Biggest dub I‚Äôve ever seen
They just found an acceptable, ethical way of manufacturing tortoiseshell scissors. Pretty cool. I‚Äôd keep one of those in my desk.
Let him eat it at least!
Dr.turtoise
great idea.
"Bro, I was about to eat that!"
Good turt. You may have lettuce for another day
Goodbye first rate education
Man I love these little guys
My uni!
I guarantee if I was that dude, the turtle would've ignored the vegetation, I would've tried to point to where Yertle was supposed to bite, gotten my finger bitten, then taken the rope down as I passed out
Never thought Lincoln would be recognised for any animal other than a Swan tbh, this is crazy
Made my day
Sir, please put me down so I can finish my meal
Posting this without context would be hilarious
"Nuts, I dropped my food. Hey, guys? Hello? Someone want to help a tortoise out? Shit."
Great job little guy
Then they dunked the turtle in a vat full of toxic chemicals in a bid to create better cosmetic lotions or some crap.
I fricking love this
I wonder how many turtles will be dropped during copycat events.
/r/animalswithjobs
This is how all buildings should open
Is that Chris Packham? Lol.
Why is Chris Packham is using a tortoise as scissors...

Does this mean I can use my cat as a stapler?
everybody there thinking ‚Äúlettuce in‚Äù
This is way better than ribbon cutting!
This is the best!

Where food go?

Hey, that was my uni :D
He‚Äôs gonna achieve his dreams!!!
Later he sacrificed his life in the same club for the experiments
Gavin Belson holding a turtle
I would‚Äôve kept this completely silent until the Turtle bit the ribbon, then put the Heavy going ‚Äúnom‚Äù right there
This is so fucking wholesome I can't even deal with it
He was so hype it actually worked
This is the type of accolade I feel I deserve every time I eat vegetables.

Omg, that was the cutest thing ever!
Probably up in the air like, ‚Äúwhere the FUCK did my salad just go?!‚Äù
I just graduated from there! How do I not know about this? üòÇ That's the coolest thing I've heard of from Lincs!
How many times do the big silly scissors fail! and here is ol' mate nailing his job in one go!!! I promote Tortises' to official openers of all events.
stop it THATS SO CUTE
That guy is MasterTortoise
Is that Chris Packham?
Mine Turtle says hello! And it‚Äôs the University of Lincoln so Tomska makes sense to reference here!
Poor tortoise! He‚Äôs like ‚Äúoooo a snack!‚Äù And then snack falls and then this giant lifts him farther from his snack. Give the damn tortoise the leaves you monsters!
That's not a tortoise that's Chris Packham
Hopefully someone shouted "TURTLE POWER!"
THAT IS SO FREAKING CUTE!!!
I was so excited that Lincoln, NE made my front page and then realized I‚Äôm an idiot.
This was the year after I graduated from Lincoln, would've been more apt to have gotten a swan to do it.
Hey! Where'd my lunch go?
Let him finish eating

i‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll be treating the animals really great there
lmao so nice

Whilst they have a lab they should clone a T-Rex for the tortoise to ride into campus on. It's not like war crimes and breaking the Geneva convention is anything out of the ordinary for students here at Lincoln in the UK.  

Lincoln is where I live, it's not hard to guess where items laced with drugs are coming from which are then being pushed into our supply chain. But to be fair there's also a large amount of middle class drug addicts in Lincoln too, so you know they tend to work together. It's a fucked up little cult party down here in Ye Olde Lincoln.
