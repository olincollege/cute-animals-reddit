The story of how Earthquake came to be is actually a little unusual, as he was never technically born. My wife worked at a vet clinic, and walked into an operating right immediately after a spay of a very pregnant cat - a "spaybortion", if you will. The removed uterus was moving, and she found four potentially viable kittens inside, and took it upon herself to try to save them.

She took the four preemie kittens home and did her best for them. Only Earthquake survived (and it is a testament to my wife's abilities that he did). He's mostly ok, except that he's got a little of that "bottle baby" attitude, and also has some mild asthma, for which he has a ridiculous inhaler:

[Earthquake's inhaler](https://imgur.com/FRF6oPG)
He looks like the ‚Äúbirthquake‚Äù joke was his idea and he‚Äôs waiting to see if everyone gets it.

Fukken fantastic. I love everything about this.

Edit: thanks for the awards, everyone! I'm mentally re-gifting half of them to Earthquake and the other half to my dog who celebrated his 13th birthday a few days ago. Also, Earthquake, I have asthma too, and I also have to use a ridiculous looking inhaler. Keep on keeping on, you magnificent beast.
I LOVE THIS. "Birthquake" is beyond phenomenal, I can't stand how fantastic that is
Ooh what is his earthcake made out of?
Precious! r/catswhoyell would like him too!
YOU MAKE MY EARF QUAKE
Why do you call him earthquake?
If you ever get another cat you gotta name him Typhoon and call your pair of cats "The Natural Disasters."
I‚Äôm high and thought this was my poor reading skills. Happy birthquake lil friend
I don‚Äôt even know what to comment because I love every aspect of this
Can I get a "yeah!" yeeeAAAAAaaaah
As the owner of a cat we have nicknamed The Furnado I feel like your cat is speaking to me right now. 

Happy Birthday you absolute lad.
Ten-point-oh on the Richter scale, it's shakin' like an an Earthquake, move your tail!
HE IS SO HAPPY
That is the absolute coolest name for a cat
Happy broth day earthquake! Here‚Äôs to a long life full of purrs, good health and happiness!

Happy Birthquake Earthquake!!!! May your day be as amazing as you are handsome (which is very)
You cat is named earthquake? That‚Äôs fucking awesome
The names you guys come up with for your pets is always impressive
That's a great name. Happy Birthquake Earthquake.
How did he get the name "Earthquake" I wonder.
Came to say my first cat was an orange tabby named Earthquake. He came to live at my parents house after an Earthquake in SoCal in the 80s, when I was 4-5. He just decided to move in one day. He was one of the best!
Happy Birthday!
That Dracula smile ü¶á
Omg what a pretty kitty. That coloring is so pretty.
Hearing that cats name called would definitely keep me on my toes out here in california
Earthcake!
How do you make cats smile like that?
I can hear this photo.
I'd love to know the origin of this name.
...........you named it........."Earthquake?"
Upvote for the name Earthquake, 10/10.
‚ÄúHooman, you remembered it!!‚Äù
Omg that smile!

Do you call him by a nickname? Or always Earthquake?

Very cute! Love him!!
At first glance I thought the birthday boy was wearing glasses
I love Earthquake
He looks so happy üòÑ
The most fitting name to a cat 'Earthquake'
I wonder what's the story behind this interesting name
All I could think of was the [Overly Attached Girlfriend meme.](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/overly-attached-girlfriend) 
...the fact that I‚Äôm apparently the only one to think of that meme makes me feel _slightly_ old.
Anyways, happy birthday, Earthquake!
Happy Birthday Earthquake
Happy Birthday Earthquake!   
Can I have two guesses on the name?  


1)Born during an earthquake  
2)Runs around the house so much he causes earthquakes of emotion
Great work on your Taxidermy.
Earthquake!  That is what I should have named my cat. There is nothing graceful about her. 

Happy Birthquake Earthquake!
Is the cat supposed to eat all of that‚Ä¶.?
If he ever gets fat, you could also call him Girthquake.
What's that on the wall plug over there on the right?

edit: Also, pet Earthquake happy birthday for me. ‚ù§
Earthquake's birth cake
I see meme potential in this
Bruh.. that's a metal name for pet if i ever heard one.
" Earthquake come here! "
" WHOOOMMMST HASSSS SSUMMONNNEEDDD MMMEEEE? "
...

" Oh that's just my cat's name "
" HMMMMM. UNDERSSSSTANDABLLLE. HAAVE A GOOOD DAAAAY " *POOOF
Earthquake on his Birthquake with an Earthcake (ÔΩ°‚ô°‚Äø‚ô°ÔΩ°)
Please tell me you have another cat named Typhoon!
My dog‚Äôs name is earthquake ;) we call him quake for short
I love cats with ridiculous names. What do you shorten it to?

I am the proud owner of a Samsquantch for the last 8 years (trailer park boys reference) and we all call her squantch. It's really fitting for some reason.

I'm wondering if the name fits the cat. By the look of the pictures I'm gonna say yes.
It's also my birthday today, and my internet username is usually The Quake, such a strange feeling to find this today! Not that anyone is going to notice this post so late though.
I love everything about this picture and story. Happy Birthquake Earthquake!
Sure he's not a 6.5?
Happy cake day, Earthquake!
You called your cat "Earthquake"?

How did that happen?!
Happy 7th birthday Earthquake!!!!

Sorts through the 100s of photos you took to find the one where the cat looks like it‚Äôs smiling so you can post some cringey comment
The worst part of reddit, people and their stupid pet names.

Missed opportunity to spell it Bearthquake

Hey. It‚Äôs my bday, too. Happy birthday, Earthquake
When I was a kid my step-dad brought home a kitten that he had saved on his way home from work. He rode a bike and someone literally just threw a kitten out the window as they drove by. I miss that kitty. He was the one that was with us the longest (we had...a lot of cats. Yes it was stinky). He'd play hide and seek with me.
Cute
.
Happy phursday!
Everything about this is perfect.
What is in there? Cat food with...? Pancake mix?
This reminds me of Red in Pineapple Express ‚Äúit‚Äôs my cats birthday today‚Äù

More proof that cats are evil. Don't understand why anyone would choose to be around them.
Awww they look so happy! Can you tell them that I said happy birthday? :)
Happy birthday kitty. My cat just celebrated her 7th birthday yesterday.
Happy birthday, Earthquake!
He is precious
He looks happy
Earthquake has got to be the fucking coolest animal name ever.

Girth Quake!
With a name like Earthquake I was expecting quite a bit of chonk but still I'm glad to see a healthy kitty.
Earthquake looks super excited to be celebrating!!! Happy day, kitty!
So when you need to call him in of an evening?...

Is the crock pot on the floor because the counter belongs to Earthquake?
What's the thing plugged in on the floor?
He seems to be ready to do some mischief
That‚Äôs a bad ass name for a cat
birthquake:

 When a female [**in labor**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=in%20labor) makes the final push to get the baby out, but lays a fart so long and loud it measures on [**the Richter**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20Richter) [**scale**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scale).

Why did you name the cat earthquake what influenced you?
An strange but beautiful name to have
what did he do to deserve that name?
I love it, but may I know the idea behind the name?
omg baby
Now...eat the cake in front of him.
Happy birthday Earthquake!!!! From Oliver (my savannah) and I!!!!
Your cat reminds me of Steve Buscemi for some reason lol
I like the text on the cake but earthquake is a weird name
That cat looks stoked as hell.
I have known 1 cat that deserved that name. So heavy you could hear every step as it descended the carpeted stairs.  Thunk. Thunk. Thunk. Family cat for a friend in High School, years ago now.
Such a fitting birthdayquake for Earthquake üòçüòç
HAPPY LATE BIRTHDAY TO YOUR ADORABLE CAT!!
Cute lil birthday quake
kat
He looks so happy
Very funny üòç
My first thought was ‚Äúdamn that‚Äôs a scary dog‚Äù
Happy birthday beautiful boy! I'm impressed your mom was able to save you, she's an incredible person with a very big, loving, selfless and beautiful heart. I admire your family and wish you many more beautiful happy birthdays, sweet orange baby üéÇ
Bless your wife for saving this precious life!  He's beautiful and obviously bursting at the seams with personality!

I wish his three siblings would've survived too.  How any vet could abort kittens that close to being born is horrible.  Why not let them be born and then adopted out?  Why did Earthquake's moms' people wait so long for her to be spayed in the first place?
Happy Birthquake earthquake, please don‚Äôt cause any tremors with all that cuteness
What a happy kitty excited for some cake!
Fluffy!
happy birthquake earthday!
You seein this shit?
Earthquake is the greatest name for a cat, I think
Happy Happy Birthday Earthquake And Many Many Many more Happy Healthy Birthdays to You

I would commit mass genocide to save this one cat. Without even knowing it.
