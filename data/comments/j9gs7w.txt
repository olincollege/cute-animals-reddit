That’s freaking adorable. I’d love to see her zooming around.
I just discovered that I love Pigeon. Awwww
How much of an average day does she spend in the cart?
That ended WAY too soon. We need to see her in action!
And the Grinch’s heart grew 3 sizes that day. 💗
I have a leg disability and my foot orthotic broke (temporarily, it will get fixed) on Saturday. This is the emotional support I needed tonight.
It makes me so happy seeing people putting an effort to improve the quality of life for animals that need it.

Right in the feels..
What a good girl. She gets excited but knows to stop and wait and be patient while mum puts her in.
She deserves all the loves
Cute! 
We bought from Eddies wheels also
What happened to her back legs? And she is super cute
Love it
This is legit cute.
Fuck out here whoever got them onions
I awwwed so many times and wasn’t even thinking of the sub when I checked. This was the most “duh, of course it’s r/aww” I’ve ever experienced.
She’s such a happy girl! She won’t let her disability get in the way! :)
Sometimes you don't know what you need until you get it.
That's got to be the most adorable gif I have seen today
She is the cutest!!!
So heart warming. Love Ms Pigeon.
As a double amputee prosthetics user, I know how liberating a device can make one feel.
So lovely <3
I'm not crying you're crying!
Pigeon, I love you.
I hope someday to be as happy as Pigeon.
Pigeon is the best
Dogs are amazing. So resilient.
This made me so happy!!! Thank you!
Awww good dog
Omg she is an angel ❤️
Fly pigeon, fly you precious pup. 🥺
DISABLED DOG ZOOMIES
That is made so well!!! Good doggy can get around! Now I need to see a video in action
You got to love it. Pigeon is willing and ready to go 😊
Omg she's so sweet!! How adorable! I just love it! Dogs are amazing!
My love for Pigeon knows no bounds
This is @pigeonpup on IG.
HOTWHEELS
Awwww
I need to see more of Pigeon
That dog is wheely happy!
Sooo many OMGs!!!!
Great now Im sad AND happy!
I love animals because they never feel sorry for themselves. So happy just to be alive.
What a sweet pup. Thank you for loving a disabled animal. I had one too, and they are so worth it!
My dog does basically this when I ask if he wants to go to the park lol. Dogs are too precious
Omg what a sweet happy baby!!!! I love her, such joy!!!!
I wanna see her zoom
Bless pigeon and may she only know happiness
She’s got so much energy!!! Love her!!!
Oh my god, I love her so much. What an angel.
So thankful there are people in the world who take care of dogs like this.
Yeah, bought the same exact model for my old dog, it probably extended his life a year and a half, and increased his happiness ten fold. After he passed We gave it to another lady in the neighborhood and see it from time to time. Highly recommend it for owners with dogs suffering from rear leg issues!
At times I start to lose my faith in humanity and then I see " small acts of kindness and love" that we show to others or to the other Earthlings that we share this world with and it brings me hope. Thanks for sharing.
I know it’s a tough question but I wonder what the quality of life is like for pooches like this even when they are in loving homes...
God Bless her
She loves walkin and rollin.
Awwww what a beautiful baby <3
A beautiful thing to see!
OMG I love her
I love her.Its sooooooo awesome to see thats she is loved.
We seriously don't deserve dogs
AWH OHMYGOD I LOVE HER
what happened to her hind legs
Sweet and cute, thanks
well... I wasn't planning to ugly cry today, but here we are. Heart= full
She’s beautiful and thank you
What a beautiful happy girl!

Ended too soon!! Before all the zoomies!!
I hope she gets to run on something that’s not hardwood floor too
Ooooo my gooodnessss I love herrrrr
She's so wholesome
Good people taking care of a good dog, such awesomeness! Please post video of her zooming with her chair?  ;)
Go get 'em, Pigeon.
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go!!!
My cat is Pigeon too! Best pet name ever!
I love her already. She needs snuggles and loves and pets and treats. Please share those with her. 

I’m also thinking “Lady and the Tramp” when you say her name is Pigeon.
Lovely !!
What a sweet little thing
Goodest girl ❤️
This is both incredibly sad, and heart warming to the point of tears
wtf this video ended too soon. ugh!
Whyyy would you end the video like that ? We want Zoomies and we want them now!
I adore this sweet girl! What a positive attitude she has.
Aww even the other dog was excited for her !
Oh my heart 😍😭😭

I love when animals have names like Pigeon. I just find it so cute. I had a friend that had a dog named turtle and I thought it was such a great name.
If wish spells were real i would gladly use it to give pigeon to strong back legs
This is so wholesome and sad at the same time
Fuck this warms my heart. What a good baby , hope she had a fun walk ❤️
So precious!!
We had the joy of Ed's Wheels changing how happy my boy was in his last year. It was wild just seeing him from struggling to being overjoyed to run around. Really makes you be thankful for these precious moments. Thank you so much for taking your girl into consideration and giving her this happiness <3 the excitement says it all!

BOUNCEY BOUCEY

You're a very kind person to offer this much help to a dog. It says alot about your character. People like you make this world a better place.
People like this are the real heroes. A disabled doggie AND a senior in the same vid. Heartwarming AF.
I absolutely need a follow up video of her running around and being happy
She's so cute I love him/her
I always wonder when I see these that why the wheels are so far back. All the weight is leveraged straight on the back and front paws. Why not make the wheels more load bearing?
i love how even though her legs dont work she still jumps around
I feel like when this happens to a cat people just have it put down.
You are a good soul for caring for a special needs critter. Thank you.
How does this make me so happy but also so sad at the same time

This is beautiful, you’re such nice people not giving up on her.
You are great people for not giving up and just putting her down. People like you give me hope in humanity!! Bless you!!!

Now, that's why I pay Internet. My day is full of joy now. Thank You good and wholesome being.
Pigeon is so adorable ❤️
I really regret giving my free award to another post
I was crying from a bad day and after watching this I stopped
Kind of an awkward question maybe but how do you handle the “potty training” and stuff?
I’m so fucking depressed and this is the first thing in months that made me genuinely happy for a fleeting moment. I absolutely adore dogs, they have the best attitude towards life.
Thank you for sharing! When I see heart warming stories like this - I can only hear in my head Smashing Pumpkins - Cherub Rock. “Let me out!” - not from the device .... but I REALLY want to go outside and be a dog!
Even her buddy over there was getting hyped lol
I am not crying, you are 🥺
So sweet :)
I love her
who’s chopping onions again
its enough to make a grown man cry.....and its ok.
I wished I got excited about anything half as much as she get excited about getting strapped into that thing.
I love her
This made me smile.

Aww.
Hello Pigeon. It's been about 6 months since I saw you last. Good to see you still rake in those big karma numbers.
I work at an Emergency Vet and we have a regular that comes through for physical therapy, he zoooms on his cart! Running up curbs and off-road like it’s no big deal! He’s part bully so his front half is extra built, dude is jacked
Love dogs ❤️
this made me so happy
You should have given him pogo sticks instead of wheels, wheels don't bounce very good.
This owner is a saint.
My dog just suffered a stroke. Thank u
It’s enough to make a grown man cry...
This is the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my god damn life!  Grown man crying tears of pure joy here.

This is so freaking wholesome, I love it
Omg such an excited good pup 😍😭❤️❤️❤️
I grew up near a dog who had a carriage like that,it’s such a beautiful thing to see them still enjoying a full and healthy life and seeing pigeon getting excited,put the biggest smile on my face. I wish I could take Pigeon for a walk.
If she gets bullied, all of reddit will just beat them up
Wheelie dogs are so adorable when they get the wheels on. And then man look out, little or big they are speed demons lol. Pigeon is gorgeous <3
This is the smile I needed today! What a happy pup!
Thank you for being such a wonderful dog mom.
Bet that chair was hella over priced

The goodest doggo 🥺
I love her and her cute little hippy hops
Awe this sweeet little white hippo ❤️
I see a lot of dogs without working legs and being in wheelchairs online and I have to ask because I don’t know. Why do some dogs have legs that don’t work? Is this a condition of some kind?
SHe’s the best girl.
Excited pit bulls are the best
Do they get really muscular front legs?
That's so cute but so sad! I have to ask, what exactly is it that's wrong with her?
u/Savethisvideo
What's her back story?
Went from awd to fwd
Sweetest zoomie pup and her assistive device!

Also - Which one of you rascals awarded this Crab Rave? lol
May I asked what happened to her?
Has there been a lot of research and development of animal prosthetics?
i approve of this video

[deleted]
What happened to her legs if u don’t mind me asking
Oh my god the poor thing! What happened?
I'm going to need some evidence of the outdoor zoomies
What a GOOD GIRL
This made me a bit sad!  I was shopping for wheels like this a couple weeks back.  My 55 lb lab/pit mix somehow hurt his spine and within a week stopped using his back legs.  Took him to two vets (first meds weren’t strong enough) and thankfully he started walking again about a week later.  It’s been 3 weeks, weaning the meds.  Praying he gains the weight back and continues to be ok.  So it could’ve been an injury this dog had.  Amazing how quick the muscle goes away.  Super cute doggie!
This put a big smile on my face with teary eyes.
The goodest girl that ever was
I love how even tho she can't use her back legs, even without her wheelchair, she still gets zoomies. Pitbulls will be pitbulls🤦💖.
Thank you so much. This made me very happy.
Pigeon for prez 2020
Also where can i see more of her!!
This makes me happy
that’s soooo adorable
you have a heart of gold

I like how she hopped around even after getting into the chair

Omg! I am in LOVE with Pigeon ❤️❤️❤️
I used to have a beagle that became paralyzed in the back limb as well from zooming around in the house and bumped into the shelf. But one of my relative knows a traditional Chinese medicine doctor decided to treat him with acupuncture and miraculously he recovered. So I know how sad the dog gets before he gets his wheels and how happy he is after he recovered. I’m glad he is so happy.
I love this!❤
Awesome
She likes pulling off wheelies
What's wrong with her hindlegs?

I thought she was paralyzed first, but but can clearly see her move them when she gets strapped in.
That’s so precious!!!!
My precious!!!!
I can't like this enough!

What an angel!!!! I’d love to see her moving and grooving around, she’s such a happy little bean!
Shes beautiful!!! We have a wheelie girl as well!!! Her name is Sissy.  I wish she was as excited for her chair.
Dogs have such an enviable energy and thirst for life. It warms my heart.
The sweetest baby angel
Wouldn't you be, you go from dragging yourself along the floor to running!!!
Oh no my heart is about to explode!

Hey Pigeon! You’re a beauty! Hope all is well with you and your crew :). Someone said to tell you “Hi” 🐶
Awww so adorable
Does the dog play ping pong?
the pop at 28 looked horrible
Good feelings over load!
Melted my heart !!! 😍
This is the most wholesome video I saw today!!
Why not leave her in the chair? Can she not lay down comfortably with it?
That’s a great girl
You are a good hooman. ❤️
I've watched this SO many times and it has never yet failed to make me happy. This dog is awesome
Power of life!
We should all learn from it.
I love her and love you for taking care of her!!!
What a wonderful girl! Good doggie:)
What is the problem with her legs?
Oh my god what a perfect puppy, she deserves all the treats
I love her and her name.
Awww this just made me cry!! My dog just had her leg amputated from inoperable cancer and I’ve been wallowing in and out of sadness for her. I needed to see this.
I may have shed a tear 😊
I love seeing Pigeon videos. She always seems like a happy, excited, good girl. She has a loving family, it looks like.

Cutest thing on all of reddit. Ever.
Is she in pain? I’ve had two dogs who have gone through severe hip dysplasia as well as bone cancer. They ALWAYS panted. I was told by the vet they do that when they are in pain. Also this is adorable. I love how happy she seems when the chair comes out:)

If this makes you smile, check out The Fowler Herd. A lady has many dogs in carts and she takes (most) of them on a daily walk that she posts. They are all so awesome, especially little Hope.

I love this dog so much. Does she have a fanclub?
This makes my heart smile.
Does she ever try to poop while shes in her chair?

Why is it called a chair?
best thing I've seen all day. some unknown moisture has appeared around my eyes. god bless this person.
Although it breaks my heart seeing her having this condition, it also fills my heart with joy seeing she is so happy and ready to burst out of excitement to get out. I'm sure she gets all the kisses, hugs and treats in the world cuz she's a good girl.

Sooo... I guess I could figure this out with half a sec of googling, but *why* take it off to begin with? I assume crating and... uh... excretion, but why let them off apart from that?

I'm such a sucker for these wheelchair dogs. Just makes me so happy to see every time.
Human: Ready to go?

Pidgeon: woof!

Human: yay!
That is beyond adorable my man
That's Cute dog.  I used to work for a place called K9 carts west.  I resigned there wheel chairs while I was there.  I worked in the manufacturing section.  McAfee
Made lots of these for lots of animals. Very rewarding job.  To see a depressed dog come in,  get their first set of wheels,  and see them run the field tongue hanging,  tails wagging,  just happy again,  was very touching.  I had to leave because the boss's brother was a piece of,  you know.  But that's another story.  Made one good s skunk,  a hamster, a great Dane,  and the company,  not me,  made one for a miniature horse.  It's sad when an needs one,  especially if it's because the vets puts them on something like cage rest.  I've seen that when a dog got injured,  the vet did that,  and the dog healed messed up for life,  because the vet didn't know about these things.  The place I worked at would rent these out,  very reasonable prices, so they could be used line crutches for healing,  or if it wound up being permanent,  incase your rental equals the full price, it's yours.   People should know that these can also be used for rehab too. That way they don't have to stay in one until they die,  if the owners even know they can get one.  By the way,  I think the hips need to be adjusted lower.  It looks like you're putting a lot of weight in the front legs. That'll tire the dog out faster.  Some dogs stay in their cart most of the day.  Just have to watch out for sores around the legs.  I just love seeing these videos.
Do you ever see something so cute you feel your heart about to explode? What a precious baby!
Front wheel drive dogs now coming to a dealer near you!

So you use the chair for taking a walk only? And what’s with her legs? Muscle atrophy?
That's so heartwarming omg
We don't deserve dogs
Who'm ever invented this is a fucking genious.
hi pigeon
What the FUCK is OATMEAL
That's wholesome
I didn't know dogs came in front wheel drive
My heart melts.  Cute little doggie
Fall 7 times stand up 8!! She’s so happy despite it all!
This has got to be the cutest thing i've ever seen in my life.
This was so warming to see.
Best lady
So, whats the story with her hind legs?
thats put a smile on my face
This made my day. Thank you.
I wanna bite! So much excite!
I've been going through some really hard times lately but that really made me smile for the first time in a long time. Thank you that made my day
That last part is impossible to get through without having a sobbing fit. Anyone who tells me they didn’t cry watching this, I say you’re full of it. Maybe the weakest among us didn’t cry. Me personally? To took me like twenty minutes to write this, because my eyes are blurry from the tears.
Who's cutting onions at 6:00AM?!?!
Awwwww
This has to be the most adorable thing i have ever seen
Is the cause of the back leg issue a genetic defect?
Even this hardened bastard cracked a smile
Omg I love Pigeon! Absolutely adorable!
That's so cute happy no matter what. We should take  notes
Why don't you leave her on the chair?
Holy shit, this is sooo sweeeet!!
He’s so happy

I have a cat that cant move his legs just like that

He hates the chair
Why am I envisioning the pup going full on zombies and running over toes, legs, busloads of cats with the cart haha!
Caaaan myyy hearttt
Thabk you I was wondering if her back legs were paralyzed.
Well that made me cry, that's so adorable
This is the first time I have ever seen sitting zoomies.
Sit! Oh wait...
This guys ready to roll out!
I love this so much, but I wasn’t wearing glasses when I read the title and I thought it said “executed”
Dogs are the best!
🥰
She's so cute and so is your other puppy. So glad you did this for her. We're familiar with dogs with disabilities like this. Sometimes it's not easy but sooo rewarding!

If I didnt cry already I'd probably cry
Seriosly put the dog down. That is horrible life.
u/The_Dowager
No offence, but why does she use the chair? At first I thought she didn’t have legs, then I thought she couldn’t use them, but in the end she turned out she could move her legs. Is the wheelchair(wheelharness?) just a toy or something?

Ok
Put that poor dog down. This is cruel, not cute.
Hey! Lets use a gimped animal to get upvotes!
Pure torture to let an animal suffer through life like that.
We don’t deserve dogs.....
Dang no back legs AND he’s gotta try to get around on wood flooring?  At least get a floor rug or something...
Just throw the dog in the bin
[removed]
So sad, why did you break her legs?
I can relate so much. I miss my buddy :(
Jesus, put it down
how do they poop

edit: why down votes? it's an actual question

I’m assuming you all Love animals!  Same.  Just asking a small thought to not eat animals tonight, either.  My adorable pup has the same brown eyes as a cow.  Just sayin. Think about it, my friends.
r/WTF
Poor thing is overweight. That will be/is extremely detrimental for the dog's shoulders and front. Not to mention exacerbating everything that the physical limitations already do on that's dog's body.
Why she need a chair?
I think a restructure in the order of operations is in order. The dog probably has diminished feeling in the hind legs, so I'd put those in the harness before the front strap. That way the dog gets a clear indication when it's ready to go. Just a thought
