Hell, the level of chill in that dog made ME flop over.
This was too stinking cute. The head nuzzle at the end sealed the deal.
God i love animals
The way the pupper moved his head so he would be cheek-to-cheek with the bun!! My heart owwww
Years ago, my friend had a bunny that never seemed to like anyone, with the occasional exception for my friend.  Every time I went over to their house, I made a point of greeting the bunny.  After a few weeks, this bunny was seemingly in love with me.  He'd hop around my feet, sit in my lap and let me pet him, sometimes even fall asleep in my lap.

I miss that little bunny.
the bunny is performing [binkies](http://language.rabbitspeak.com/did-you-say-binky/)
Dogs always look like The Reasonable Pet when other species are in the frame. Rabbit got the zoomies? Sure, cuddle the little rascal. Cat wants to fight? Sigh, settle down you goofball before I have to sit on you.

When there’s only a dog in frame, that’s when they get the stupids.
Rabbits are very special animals. They are unlike both cats and dogs mainly due to them being prey animals so they can be constantly on edge worrying about being attacked. With this knowledge it makes it so much more special as to the special bond this rabbit shares with the doggo and the environment because it’s literally put down all its walls and trusts who and where it is completely.
Even better, those little happy hops they're doing are called "binkies" and the flop is literally refered to as a flop. It means bunny trusts the thing by it.
akita* protec
3 binkies and a flop, that's a happy bunny
Those hops are by far the cutest things I've ever seen.
###DO NOT ADOPT OR GIVE PEOPLE BUNNIES FOR EASTER.  

That's it.
Oh my God oh my God oh my God
Lol, at the very end, bunny is like “HEY!!! Ok, I trust you, weird gigantic bunny.” Dog sniffs like he’s thinking “oh geez! :) small hopping potato needs a heckling rest”
Where I grew up, buns would lay like this in my back yard in the evening. I guess it was a very safe bun environment.
This reminds me so much of my bunny that passed away a few years back.  We adopted her from the humane society and she has been neglected and mistreated before we got her so she was extremely skittish.  It took her a loooong time to get used to us.  Eventually she did and, while she wasn’t generally the cuddly type because of the past trauma she dealt with, you could tell she was ok with us.  She would jump onto the foot of my bed while I was sleeping (bedroom was rabbit proofed and she was sometimes allowed there at night.) She was a HUGE bunny so definitely felt her there.  She’d be standing up and then INSTANTLY be flopped over.  I could never figure out how a giant animal could flop over so fast without making the slightest bump on the bed.  Swift and gentle giant.  I miss her a lot.
Is the bunnies name Einstein? Because his hairdo reminds me of a mad scientist
[deleted]
I showed this to my wife and she said and I quote "what's up with that bunny? Looks like Einstein! No, no Bernie Sanders! ....Bunny Sanders!"
Holy cow, a rabbit video on r/aww that actually shows a well cared for rabbit. 

It’s a miracle.
Hippity hoppity Easter's on its way
That’s precious 🙂♥️
That was so sweet I now have cavities
Crying in the club rn
awwww
I love how the dog seems to notice too like "oh you showed me your tummy, I will lay next to you now. I am glad you are comfortable".
It’s called a binky!!! My little homey Professor Wiggles used to do them all the time as an expression of joy.  I didn’t have that awesome dog for him to chill with but we still had a good time ;)
That is just beautiful.
This is the most "aww" thing Ive seen in r/aww
Also, that kind of jump is called a “binky” and indicates joy and happiness. This is a very well looked after bunny.
I had no idea. I just adopted a bunny Thursday and the next day I found her just flopped on her side. She does it when people are around. I would have thought that she will be hiding all day long. She’s actually really friendly and he only thing she doesn’t like is to be picked up (we only did that twice to transfer cages).
bun: \*hop!\* \*hop!\* \*flop!\*  
doggo: aww smol bun! everything is cool. we do a nap nao. ❤️😴
Shibe is like “are ya done yet, I would like to sleep now”
This is easily the cutest thing I’ve seen in a long time omg
To be honest this is the cutest thing i’ve ever seen
Is that an Akita Inu?
I flop over for this bunny!!
r/rimjob_steve
Those binkies!!! Such a happy bun
The dog is on 420 the rabbit is on cocaine
I wish I had the patience of your dog...
These people got a husky AND a bunny? lucky
Dog: This strange hopping cat keeps waking me up.
let's play, dog!

no, let's not.  Ever hear the saying, let sleeping dogs lie?

OK. {flop} Nap now, play later, dog.

That's the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen in my entire life.
When me and ny ex had bunnies, the two adult female bunnies would do that, and the one that was a mom probably did it due to being tired. I never knew they did that when relaxed, i guess our bunnies were really relaxed a lot?
God this is the cutest thing I saw all day. The bunny is so happy. You can tell by those little fluttery jumps he is doing. They’re called binkies. And bunnies do those when they are very happy/content. And yes the final flop in the end is that of total trust and comfort.
true friendship conquers all .... the dog is mad chill
awwwww when they both rest their heads on each other 💖
I would get a bunny if they live 20 years. I think the avg life is like 7 though. I couldn’t handle that.
It's amazing that dogs learn not to harm other animals we keep as pets.
AWWWWWWWWWWWW😍😍😍
this might be the most aww thing i've ever seen on aww
this doggo ptrotecc
Help, it's so cute it's physically painful. HHHHHHNNNNNNNGGGGG
I can hear that dog's thoughts "will you sit down for the love of Jaysus, I'm trying to have a sleep"
Doggo has learned to tolerate the zoomies.
Oh! My ovaries can only get so big! ♥
Animals are just superior to us in so many ways.
That’s the cutest thing I've seen all month.
It needs more votes.
Do you know what else flops over when it feels safe? Children. This is a very close representation of my five year old daughter when she wakes me up.
Sooo cute. I have got 2 bunnies year ago and they are pure good.
This is just too much.
This is so wholesome
Ow my heart. I wish I could have a small fluffy pet but my French Brittany would never stop trying to chase a bun :(
u/VredditDownloader
"what if I do THIS? Nothing? All right, well what about this! Or these, huh?? Nothing?... all right, we cool."
My dog would have eaten it after the first bounce...
Wow my two favorite animals, Japanese Akita and Bunnies, in one gif! Amazing
I want more!
They both have cool demon eyes.
That’s the goddamn cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Rabbits are so interesting and complex. I love seeing different species chilling with each other like equals. Think about it...we don’t do that. We try to control other species. Interesting to think about.
The devil eyes reflection on the dog at the end made me feel this was about to end very differently.
r/rimjob_steve
That is freaking adorable.
Rest easy, jumpy snack jellybean
Come on bro, I just want to play
That head butt.
So many Binkies... And then flop.
Dogs are so chill around anything. Put one human around them and they lose their shit.
Oh. Mah. Goodness. Gracious. That moment when he sniffs the bun buns soft little head and cozied in :D
Bunnny 🥰
That rabbit gave the dog everything in its playbook, from binking, to racing around to show off, then a super bunny flop.  Rabbit couldn't love dog more...
This is so beautiful
This is the cutest thing in all of the universe
My bunny does this sometimes lmao
I. Can. Not. Even.
From what little I read, it's actually that back hops that tell you it feels safe - it's being playful.
Such spaz. Much flop.
Awwwww sweeties!!!
I've been looking into getting a bunny and this just convinced me big time.

Can you potty train bunnies?
Rabbits are the best. If you can gain their trust they are the best companions.
I'm really scared of dogs but this just,,, melted my heart.

What a great way to start off Easter!
That is the cutest thing I've ever seen

That’s the sweetest thing I have seen today. Thanks OP
That is the cutest little thing ever
Boing. Boing. Blop. 
#🐇
she's just born small
Can confirm. Former owner of two bunnies. We would all be sitting in the living room and I’d just hear a little thump. I look and there they both are (they were brothers) laying on their side. Freaked me out the first time before I looked it up. I miss them ☹️.
My bun used to do that.  
Back of his house; Flop.  
In the living room; Flop.  
In the garden in summer; Flop.  
  
And that's how we found him when he died last week :/  
  
He was a big Rex, and more like a dog than a rabbit.
And those little jumps?  Called Binkys or binkying.  Means they are *really* happy. So damn cute.
my heart hurts
This is amazing.  I'm stunned the dog didn't react to the quick movement in a predatory manner.  It's like the bunny thought that too and really tested the dog before hand. 

If dogs and rabbits can get along I have hope for people:)
Its called popcorning and guinea pigs do it too
Also the sideways hop is called “binkie” they do that when they’re happy as well
yea so if this bunny isn't named Doc Brown or Bernie i don't know what kind of bunny owner this person is .
gabe me a heckin big smile =)
Zoomies and then a flop. Happy bunbun!
Zootopia 2 looks great.
I think animals cuddling together is the most wholesome thing ever.
Username checks out
I've never actually seen a rabbit hop for real. I can die now.
Have an upvote for getting an "aww" out of this cynical, grumpy, joyless old bastard.
Damn it’s crazy to see all those generations of evolutionary instinct just disregarded like that haha. I mean that bunny is designed to flee constantly. His jerky movements are all about survival against those big fluid predators. And he’s just cuddling with one.
r/zoomies
Pets are called pets because they like to be Pet!

Sweet little bun bun and a tiny fluffo friend!
Can we talk about how they're possessed?
That was SO cute
My heart.....
Awww
Cute video! I find it weird how my soul is being stared into but whatever

This melts my ❤️
Aw this is cute
/r/Zoomies
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen in my life.
Is that a shiba husky mix?
r/eyebleach
My cat also flops, is he secretly bunny?
The bunny I grew up with (that was better than any dog I’ve ever known!!) used to do this all the time, we’d call it “flopping out”.
Ya know what. I bet my dog would LOVE if I got a rabbit
That is one happy and contented rabbit 😊
My.heart.
Fun fact: bunnies become completely docile when on their backs. Mine used to fall asleep when I would have them in my lap.
Seems like shibe should feel unsafe with all the sporadic hopping
AWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
The power to flop and immediately be comfortable.
100% adorable
Wakie, waakee.  It's Easter!
My heart :,(
Don't most animals only expose their vital organs when they are in a safe area? That's what this comes down to...
i wasn't ready
Such a weird username to post this video
My heart just exploded.  .  .❤

This is the best content...were done...thats it
Awwwwwww ❤️
Aww, besties for sure!!
Ahhhhh it's too cute
I thought if they flop over they are scared sooo my bunny isn't scared of me
That’s not the descendent of a fox or a coyote, that’s the descendant of a motherfucking *wolf*. We live in a strange time.
I have a bunny too! Mine is an all black Havana rabbit. She's my love!! Yours looks like a mini flop...is it? How old? My bun is about 3...I love bunnies all year not just Easter time lol!

Dog: *looks over at Bunny again* "There there"
Hey
This is nice
It's called a binky.
Are we kidding here
I'll take 10
This reminds me of my old good boy. He was like an optimistic Eeyore. Just layed around and wanted to cuddle no matter baby, child, or adult. RIP bud.
This is so adorable
What kind of dog is that?
That dog is more chill than the lofi hip hop radio with the homework girl loop animation
SHIBUUUUU
What dog breed is this

So cute, but where do the rabbits pee & poo? I heard their pee smells terrible.

Awww too cute!
Sweet little bun 💜
We had a pet bunny growing up. When she would lay over like this, you could hear her flop over from the next room over. It was the weirdest thing the first time we heard it. I loved that rabbit...
Just like guinea pigs popcorning when they are happy!
I cannot even .. fur real
Had a saint benard that a rabbit would clean itself on the back of the st. then flop down in between his front legs and just chill.
Bunny zoomie
Amazing
Dog's like I don't get paid enough for this shit.
I'm too high for this shit rn 😭
Everything is so sweet and cute until I glance over at your user name.

block movie from mind...no cry anymore.
Holy angels among us this is the most precious thing
Oh how cute it is
Aww💙
I don’t like how emotionless rabbits faces are.
Did you see his big brother....that bunny knows two things....

One his brother has his back.

Two anything big enough to take down his brother isn't going to want a snack of rabbit.
I love your dog!
Adorable why do they do that?
r/cuddleroll
this jumping makes me awww
can you house train a rabbit? Or do you just hope they don’t poop on everything?
OH MY GOD THE CUTENESS
It’s true! I used to take care of rabbits and they would do this sometimes. Made me feel so good when they did.
This feels very Miyazaki
Ded
I was waiting for the dog poem dude to show up in the comments:(
Wow, that's the sweetest thing
Thats MVP worthy
This is my new favorite thing ever
very cute ....
Squiish
This is sooooo cute. Just made my day :)
Ohhh so cute hehe!
That right there is the cutest thing ever.
The most precious thing I've ever seen.
Someone do a voiceover
Such a calm doggo! Zoomies in action!
Geez, that bun either knows the dog extremely well, or has terrible survival instincts... it’s adorable as heck though ❤️
well if this isn’t the cutest thing waAHHANSSJHDNZIDHSKNSHSUJEN
So u let rabbits shit in your bed?
Add me on Xbox Elmo is thicc
They smoken that good shit
Me too
shiba so inu
Those little jumps the bunny made in the beginning are binkies, it means the same thing
their eyes looks like GLaDOS
Bunny got the zoomies!!!
What breed of dog is this?
I've never met a Bunny pet that was not well behaved or unpleasant. I've always wanted one.
Gahhhhhh! God I love this. I come to Reddit just to see beautiful animals reduce the stress and anxiety of the modern-day fucked up life.
Oh my heart
The little rabbit tries so hard to entice his dog bud before collapsing in submission for an impromptu nap.

That's cute.
Awww
Now I know how two bunny moves, a hop and a flop.
"That's the cutest fucking thing I've ever seen."
/u/DrSandwich_md GET IN HERE
I was good until I read the username of the poster, still good though, dogs and rabbits
The snuggle at the end...
I love when bunnies popcorn
It's funny!!!
Too cute! This bunny is probably always hopped up on something and this dog is like whatever I wish you would go sit down somewhere.
My rabbit flopped over like this once, but I think mine was trying to ask for mating.  Since thing hated me and growled/grunted all the time.
I miss my bunny that passed away last Easter . They are adorable pets and I definitely want another in the future.
/u/vredditshare
Good broder
Hmm... Breakfast? Not today... Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
If that's not the cutest thing in the world I don't know what is
The also flop over when they orgasm. *the more you know*
Boing
Awwww, the little head nuzzle at the end.
Such fluffy😍
Life is cruel that way. It's all good and chill till we need something
AWWWWWWW
No they do not. This is a breed of floppy ear rabbit but the rabbit does feel very safe to be acting like that
Could it get any cuter.
Everybody do the flop!
Bunny is jumping around and the dog is like wha....???
Isn’t this common behaviour with a lot of animals, showing their underbelly means they feel safe
Yep there it is, the cutest thing I've ever seen
Aww them loves eachother. Like sibling love.
This is so heartwarming I wanna cry wtf
Ma'am, are you aware your animals are possessed?
u/jayleman
This is so awwww.
Aw
Are,  bunnies good indoor pets? I have toddlers... debating a pet recently.
I really wonder why the hunting instinct of the dog don't kick in.
That is so Adorable
It's super cute, but my damn mind kept making me worried he'd bite the bunny.
The flip over though was so cute!
Now kith.
That little fast hop. That dog just does not look to interested and till the end, looked at the bunny like an annoyed older brother telling his sibling to go to sleep.
Aww (heart exploded from the cuteness)
Adorable
I don't normally like rabbits as pets but that is one cute rabbit.
Aside from those Red Devil eyes.... “feels totally safe”
That’s cute that made me laugh
Same
Woahhh that's an anime doggo because his eyes shineee!

(He might be Doggo-God even omggg)
Those eyes..Just camera things.
So much love in this photo
Iiiiiih ca
"Oi, do you mind?"

"Whoops, sorry dude. Mind if I snuggle?"

"Yeah ^sure ^^whatever..."

"Awesome."
I thought this was r/yesyesyesno for a second and got really anxious towards the end

Disneys mouth started watering after watching this.
everybody do a flop!
That is soooooo cute!!! Great thing to see bright and early on Easter Sunday! :)
r/awwducational
😍🥰❤️
The look on the doggo's face was like "wrong move rabbit" \[due to the eyes\]
Mine throws himself down with some fair force. Then licks his paws like he's sucking his thumb...
That's one floppy hoppy.
What kind of dog??
This warms my heart
Rabbit zoomies!
Very cute
Happy Easter🐰
cool
Well damn that's the most adorable thing I'll see today!
that playful little bunnies!
So cute ! And did you know that pets have amazing benefits on kids?
Those eyes make them look demonic though.
The hops are cuter than the flop! It's like a cartoon!
Made my day.
My rabbit does this all the time, it's nice to know he feels safe and relaxed
Sly fox, dumb bunny.
This statement is repeated regularly for karma, but it's not entirely accurate. I have rabbits that will flop over anywhere, but they have a blanket that is velvety that they just love, and is where they started really doing it regularly. It's clear they love the feel of it.  They also tend to do it after dancing around or zooming, so I think it's also a sign of happiness or contentment more than safety.
I love it!
I ship it.
I actually saw this on Twitter.
This is really great.
He hop
That flipple flopple is simply adorable
Younger siblings, amirite?
That's so sweet!! :D
my bunny does this all the time and its so fricking adorable
Too cute x
That bunny looks like Julian Assange.
It is very nice! :3
Looks like Sief from Dark Souls making friends with the Killer Rabbit from Monty Python.

The cutest thing I saw on the we today!
Oh my god! That's so adorable!
I remember when my sister had a rabbit and he would do that... we always hoped nothing was wrong with him but wow now it makes sense!
Ughhh....this bunny is just too cute!! 🐇
Cute bunny needs his head checked
A bunny and a demon.
This is so cute omg 😍
That Doge is actually an Elderitch God in Doge form. Look at those glowing ember eyes!

All Hail Elder Doge!
This should be a Disney movie
Bunnies can also flop in front of other rabbits they don’t like/aren’t bonded with. Like a way to say “ha ha! I’m happier than you are! You must be miserable because I’m flopping and you’re not!”

One time a rabbit I was bunny sitting literally flopped *on top of*  the other rabbit and body slammed it. It was very funny, but also I had to separate them so they wouldn’t fight.
That's a well fed dog.
/u/vreddit_bot
u/VredditDownloader
I would probably feel safe too with a dog that has glowing yellow eyes.
Dog is certainly a Shiba Inu. Looks just like my Maximus. But unlike my Maximus, that bunny would have at least been shaken and tossed around. Pretty precious clip.
Why are animals so perfect
Bunnies jump and twist in the air (called a binky) when they are very happy. That is one joyous rabbit.
The bunny reminds me of doc brown lol
Thats literally doge
Can I get some love like that please!!!
Well, now i’m crying so thanks!
I’ll take your entire stock!
r/educationalgifs
Such a sweet doggo. :)
It's like the floof was testing to see if the doge would chase him.
That rabbit looks like it’s about to say:”Ed-ward”
Adorable... even with Devil Dog.
Dog: What the fuck are you doing? Ohhh, you're tired too. 

Awwwwwww
An Akita that got loose in my neighborhood attacked my last Dachshund, punctured his spine and stomach wall while snake killing him.  The owner paid up for all the terrible surgeries to the tune of 6K.  I hit the Akita over the head with a rock and it still wouldn’t let go of my little Fred.  I then grabbed it by the neck and pulled on it’s loose skin until it yelped in pain and let him go.  Sorry Akita fans I’m not a fan it was mean as hell.

Don’t like rabbits.
So this happened with my adopted Siberian Husky when I was a kid, I had an angora rabbit and she would run around all the time in the house and yes one fateful day Thai attacked Guinevere my rabbit. 
Hard to write about but this reminded me.
Fuck the bunny... That dog is the cutest pupper I've ever seen
I is too tired to eats you now bunnie....but later after nap maybe.


(seriously, folks...I know its cute...but don't do this.  I don't care how well behaved Mr. Flufferbutz is....you will never be fast enough to stop him if he decides he's tired of Captain BunBun's shit)
