I love the dog‚Äôs chill energy the whole time, just patiently waiting while the bunny does their thing.
I would classify that as a partial barrel roll as the bunny was fully committed and threw itself over lol!
Omg the way the dog puts his head just close enough to snuggle the bunny
Awwww my god
I'm so in love. They need their own page I can follow....
Those spastic hops (called binkies) are also an expression of joy


Edit: Wow! My karma pretty much doubled from one comment. Maybe I can add to it by letting Reddit know my wife and I have two rabbits ourselves. 
They are named Iris and Henry Winkler.

Edit2: Alright, since y‚Äôall asked for it, here are the little fur babies: https://imgur.com/gallery/gNYBswj

Iris is the gray one. Henry is the orange one. He is the biggest cuddle bug. She is adorable but has quite the attitude. She‚Äôs my beelzebunny.
I thought it was called "popcorning" or is that just with Guinea pigs?
Omgü•∞ They are so cute & FLUFFY! What sweetness.
I want to see a bunny doing backflips so bad
The pup is gorgeous.

Cute
Have bunny. Can confirm that it is extremely adorable.

Although my bun likes to aggressively flop against my closet, which rattles the doors, which spooks me depending on what tine on night he decided to do it. Stupid o' clock and fuckthisshit o' clock seem to be his favorite hours to raise hell.
Painfully cute
Bunny: happy! Happy!

Dog: hey. Time to settle down and nap.

Bunny:......... 'Kay! (Flop)

Dog: you're lucky you're adorable.
There is just something universally heartwarming about animals of different species cuddling with eachother
Be still, my heart
Question: can bunnies be potty-trained?
Bunnies are cuter than kittens. Fight me.
I love how the dog puts its nose to the bun like: ‚Äúnap time?‚Äù

Then rests its head close to the bun like: ‚Äúnap time :)‚Äù
How do we know stuff like this?
Oh the flop! The love between these two is unbelievable. Melts my heart.
I really needed this tonight (today). I have  funeral to attend Thursday I'm not prepared for and this helped make it better

I would have tried to give you an award but I have no coins because I‚Äôm new
This is some kawaii-ass shit.
Also I don't think they do bouncing like that which is known as "popcorning" which is similar to what guinea pigs do. Basically rabbits and guinea pigs do that type of hopping when they are happy. If the rabbit was scared it would be at the other end of the room. Very cool that your pets have a good friendship going. Must be a super chill doggo since its just vibing when the bunny almost kicks it in the head accidentally. And the fact that it just nuzzles into the rabbit is adorable, lol.
Awww!

I hope my new bunny will be full of happiness like that little guy.

This bunny is trying to play/sport with the dog, that little stomp on the face was no accident, lol. Then just happily chills out into bunny flops when the dog doesn't respond.
My great grandfather had a pet rabbit named Henry,and when he tied his tie for work in front of the full length mirror in his bedroom,Henry would always stand strait up next to him and stare at my grandfather in the mirror.

I love how the dog is just like, "don't mind my dude, he's just trying to get comfy."
I think its called popcorning... Guinea pigs do the same thing. My heart
I feel like that dog gave so few fucks and just wanted to snuggle.

Bunny: hop oh fuck a dog! Hop oh shit still dogo.

Dogo: Carl you fuckin do this every...

Bunny: OH SHIT A DOG

Dogo: Carl you real...

Bunny: ahhhhhhh a dogo.

Bunny: just messing Steve I know it‚Äôs you. Roles over.

The flop is very cute, but the dog snuggling up next to the bunny after made me aww out loud. So adorable.
The thing i love about it is how the dog moves its head closer to the bunny after
Yeah that bunny super trusts the dog or it wouldn‚Äôt be anywhere close. The random hops beforehand are also something rabbits do when they‚Äôre happy. This rabbit would not survive for a day in the wild.
That cuddle though. But for real, my step mom saw a wild rabbit lie down on his side once and it freaked her out a bit. It took a few explanations to under stand what she ment.
‚ÄúNo it just laid down on the side walk.‚Äù
‚ÄúWell sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell if their sitting or crouching...‚Äù
‚ÄúNo it honestly LAID DOWN on its side.‚Äù
‚Äú...Was it dead?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo! It just laid on its side, just like a cat or dog does when they find a sunny spot on the floor.‚Äù
‚ÄúWait... rabbits can do that?!‚Äù
Dog: I'll allow it.
They also do it when the nut, But ONLY when they nut on target. True fact. They often "miss" and just splash on the females fur but if they do it inside they roll over. Source: Neighbour used to breed rabbits for meat.

!SAD STORY! My neighbors bunny lived in a very small cage, fed only dog food, never played with, no water, and had no toys, it constantly shook in fear, amd it got so bad he ripped out his fur from stress. I had to call animal services to get him to a shelter and we adopted him when we moved to the next town over! He died last year and we have a memorial for him in the kitchen with his favorite toys and his favorite food. I still miss Magnolia. Rip Magnolia 2017 - 2019. Miss u bb üê∞

Our Chinchillas would do something similar, although their reflex was to jog over and then jump-kick rebounding off the wall. We'd let them run around a spare room with all the doors closed and wires/boxes off the ground so there was nothing to chew that we couldn't see.  

The males would sometimes get so happy they'd start running in a circle around the room, literally rebounding off all 4 walls gaining speed as they ran around for fun, although that was more of a "Chinchilla Zoomies" haha that was a rare occasion.  The single wall-kick hop similar to this bunny was much more common for our group of chins
You are braver than me. The way the rabbits I've had in the past poop I would never have then on my bed haha.

I miss my rabbits.
My best friend was a holland lop rabbit for a while.  He was the most awesome pet I had ever had.  Made weird noises and stomped his foot when he wanted to be pat, loved running around the house, my parents put his cage outside because they were getting upset, saying there‚Äôs germs in the house when you put an animal inside.  I wake up one morning and the cage door was broken.  I frantically looked for him.  My older brother has a husky that I wasn‚Äôt very fond of because I don‚Äôt really care for dogs.  Then I see the dog on edge of backyard with my rabbit in his mouth.  I had never cried like that before. So when I see videos like this, it‚Äôs cute and all, but makes me super uneasy watching it.
How do you keep the rabbit from peeing on the bed?
Cats do the same thing when they trust a human a lot, it means your cat feels safe with you, showing the spot where the cat can hurt but when you try to give them a belly rub, oh boy.
I swear, this is one of the sweetest videos I've ever seen.  Cuteness overload :)
Omg my heart üò≠
I used to have a holland lop. Can confirm. Binkies (the spastic jumps) and the flops mean they‚Äôre happy and safe. 
Also, if you ever want to have your heart melt, give a bunny a peeled grape. The noises the make will make you awwwwww forever.
My cat does this. We tell people she's part bunny (she's fluffy too)

This is the single greatest post of all time.
I used to have a rabbit that did that, but ended up rolling onto its back and staying in that position. She was waiting for a belly rub and always became hypnotized when she got one in that position.

That is so cute! I have a bunny and he is not too big but not really tiny either. We always thought he was hurting himself when he did that, but then I think someone told my mom that they di it when they feel safe, and now I always love watching him flop over because it's so cute. He also tends to yank at the cilantro and stuff we give him as if he's saying, "Gimme! Its mine now! Thank you!" He does that a lot with the certain food we give him and it is so cute.
Bunnies do jump back kicks when theyre happy or excited.  Those are called binkies.

These guys aren't our garden enemies. They just want food like we do. So I plant food for them, and they leave behind free fertility for me. All we need is a perspective change, and then our greatest enemy becomes a teammate.
The more videos I see of bunnies the more I‚Äôm trying to control myself by not getting one. A very hard struggle.

This is cute and all, but I think it‚Äôs offering itself up as a sacrifice
Long time bun owner here. *This* is the type of behavior you want to see from a bun who‚Äôs been introduced to a carnivore/predator friend. Bunnies are prey animals which means that they‚Äôre hardwired to be afraid of dogs and cats etc. 

It‚Äôs true, when a bun flops over like that, that means he‚Äôs feeling safe. Also, those quick hops and erratic jumps (I call them ‚Äúfriskies‚Äù idk why) are just for fun/play and to burn off energy.

It‚Äôs so sad. *Most* posts on reddit featuring a bunny and a dog/cat show an absolutely *terrified* bunny while the much larger dog pounces on and roughly bats the bunny. The poster will say something like ‚Äúawww they‚Äôre best friends.‚Äù If the dog is the *only* one having fun then they‚Äôre not best friends. 

You can tell by the bunny‚Äôs behavior in this video that this dog has been nothing but a friend to this bunny. The way the bunny actively approaches him for a sniff, and the way he cozies gently up to the bun for a nap. This is good stuff.

Things change dramatically when doggo is very hungry.
I need someone to draw this. Immediately!
Mammals are so derpy.
He protect the bun fren
We all need some love like this
How much do you have to worry about them pooping on your stuff? Would I have to be worried about it pooping in this situation for example?
This is the sweetest.

Cats sleep with their belly up when they're safe
i want what they have
This is it. This is the post that made me go awwww
Kitties do that too
is that an shiba inu?
aawwww.  That is so cute.
So cute. What breed is the dog?   Seems like it is a good breed to compliment other animals.
My bunny flopping on my chest used to feel like my biggest accomplishment in life
I hate bunnies. They make me very angry. I want to strangle it
Binkies and flops = happy bunny.  My bun doesn‚Äôt like me as much as this one loves that dog!
amazing . is it your akita ?
Good *Lord*, this is cute.
Plop
I want a house bun bun so bad! So precious
Aww the way that old Shiba cuddles up next to the bunny was the cutes thing ever
It's called a binky
The SWEETEST thing I've seen this week!
My cat does this too!
I could teach you one or two things. Good form, but you need to rely on your instincts to keep landing.
Am I the only one thinking that the bunny looks like lunch?
Wholesome post.
Nice
Wish they didn‚Äôt eat their own poop though.
How did you make their eyes into lasers like that?
Oh man. This reminds me of my cat. He did that exact same flop for YEARS until he got arthritis. He died a few days ago. I'm still a mess.
Cute little bunny nugget
Flopsie?
Mine does that
Dogs are so precious
Lop flop
Commenting so I can watch over and over again :)
Binkies and flop combo are classic
"Look what I can do!" Reminds me of snl's Stuart

Does this same rule apply for cats? I hope it does because my cat comes up to me and flops on his side all the time.
Nah he died
Look at them binkies!
I needed this today. Ty üôèüòä
This just warms my soul
Flop
Oh, my heart!
Made my day, thank you!
Awwww. So cute lols
How do you make the rabbit get over the initial distrust
Shiba's just biding it's time.
Well now my cold cold heart has melted and I am mush
Nice
This bunny feels completely safe
Hey, this is the post we tried to get RTGame to upvote!
This is the cutest thingüòç
Dog:  "You know I would eat you in the wild, right?"
You find out if bunny will be safe by rolling the dice that bunny will not be safe. This video could have ended two ways.

Wow! Such cute
I love this! Bunnies are adorable! üòÑ
My Shiba would eat that bunny so fast.
Awwwwwwww
They also do that when they die from panic-induced heart attacks.

He has a bodyguard.
This is the cutest shit ever. Made me smile.
So does most animals...
Is that an Akita?
Welp, my hearts melted
If that bunny isn't named Bunny Sanders, something is terribly wrong.
u/vredditdownloader
They should make a movie about these 2.
Binkies! Soooo cute!
Shibe to Usagi-chan
The dogs like, dude just chill out.... Finally..
Well..... That was extremely cute
And all those happy lil hops are called binkies!
So the dog is well fed and not hungry?
Nice
Remember that rabbits are active creatures that are not to be kept in a cage. I compare them to cats. They live about ten years, love to run, play and explore. They require a varied diet too
So do guinea pigs RIP Piggie
Bun did a good job
I've been seeing bunnies become more, and more common as household pets. Are they difficult to tend to/raise? I always thought owning one would be fun, but I'm worried that I'll be in over my head. Also, how do they react to other animals? Ie cats, and dogs?
Me and my ex used to own a bunch of bunnies, and they would always do that. They would constantly do that sideways jump as well, but mostly only when startled. We had this one bunny named Charlie, and he would do that sideways flop all the time, sometimes it seemed with some force, like a sideways belly flop, and would have his back legs all sprawled out and everything too. It was really cute.
Special bond.
Holy crap the cuteness here is on another level!
Very cute
The dog looks like he's saying "I'm trying to get 40 winks here, would you ever stop bouncing around the place, ya long eared fecker!"

This is the cutest fucking thing I‚Äôve ever seen ... I think I just watched it like 15x
I‚Äôm not crying, you‚Äôre crying...
Funniest thing I‚Äôve seen was a bunny after sex. They collapse on their back and stay in the position for a short while. Felt like me wanting a cigarette ( when I use to smoke) after sex üòÇ
Most animals expose their belly when they feel safe. It‚Äôs the most vulnerable part of them. So when a cat, dog, bunny, really anything lays on its side or back around you, they trust you üôÉ
I love bunnies they are so unique and amazing in their own ways as animals.

Is this rabbit a Holland lop/lionhead mix? Looks almost identical to my bun!
Noice
10/10 good form
I love this so much!! Really makes me miss my bunny :(
So cuuute! I want a rabbit so bad but i hate it when pets die :(
The best of friends
They stopped me from killing myself thanks
My bunny Rachelle  flops on me every time I go to bed .
Rabbit shit all over the bed WTF
My bunny does that too üíóüíó
More power, Rabbit!!!
So cute
My bunny and my dogs are the same way. I rescued a Dutch bunny that had been rehomed 3 times and she was only 5 months old. She is the sweetest. She is litter trained, she thinks she is one of the dogs, and she is the calmest lil bunny loaf I have ever known.
I looked over and saw my bunny,  flopped over, with closed eyes, sleeping,  and feel so accomplished right now.
My anxiety has been crazy today, but this made me feel better for a little bit. Thank you.
They also do binkies! Trust me, they're even cuter than they sound.
u/Vredditdownloader
Why is this SO **CUTE**
I've walked into a room with a flopped bunny. It is absolutely the scariest thing thinking your happy bunny is dead. When I walk towards them they wake up upset that I've woken them.
Lol the dog is thinking ‚Äòjeez... what a spazz.‚Äô
Those some good friends, right there.
I love the bunny's squishy cheeks and how they smoosh up when he lays his head down.
This is one of the nicest Reddit posts. Thank you for sharing. I have two bunnies and a Shiba Inu. Honestly they don‚Äôt mix much in my house but the dog leaves the bunnies alone. I just love rabbits; I‚Äôve had rabbits for many, many years.
Is it easy to potty train a bunny?
Well that made my day better thanks for the post
Nice
Sweetest thing ever üíïüíï
Errybody do tha *flop*
