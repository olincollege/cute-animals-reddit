He kinda looks like a T-Rex at the beginning 
How have I been deprived of baby otters for my entire life up until this moment?

"No no, is too cold."  
"I come back later"

Edit; woah.. 2k upvotes and a silver?!
Thank you!
Heck, I'm getting otter here!
OMG it is an otter learning how to otter 😀
Otters are the cutest. Makes me wish everything ate off their bellies. 
"I am strangely drawn to this liquid substance....OK, I am no longer drawn to this cold and unforgiving substance."
Fun fact: Baby otters do not instinctively know how to swim. They are taught by their mothers. Also, you do not want a pet otter.  Their poop (aka spraint) smells horrid and they rub their tails in it to spread it around. I am a zookeeper of otters, you never “ get used to” that smell. They are adorable and very smart, but the horrible spraint and scent marking outweigh any of the cuteness. 
That is simply beautiful adorable, the moment my little girl gets home from school, I’m going to show her this and then we will watch finding dory for the sea otters. 🥰
At first I thought it was a baby dinosaur 🦕
"That's good for now. I got a system."
This is water huh?    Ok i done we go now
On second thought, let’s not go to the water. Tis a silly place. 
Noped out of that one - bit like my old cat on snowy days "wheeeeee this is fun....ooo...it's cold....home...hide...warm..."
Disney movie about an otter who prefers to be on land much to the chagrin of the rest of their fellow otters. 
I don't know if I have ever seen a baby otter, boy have I been missing out!
He’s doing so good!
I think you just won Reddit.
This critter is gonna fight for Redwall once he has masted the art swimming and develop his love for blood n vinegar. 
I am sorry I cannot handle this type of cuteness. 
The cuteness factor here is dangerous and destructive. My cortex has been crushed backwards to accommodate my eyeballs as they have grown into huge cartoon-like spheres of shiny adoration. 
Longer baby otter videos, please📢📢
" no, no it's too cold"
 I'll stay on land and become a dog.
That's not an otter...it's a tiny dinosaur!
Wow, what a cute earless kitten swimming, that’s impressive.
I had to punch my wall to feel manly again 
**So fluffy i'm gonna die!!**
Awww. His head is so heavy. Sweet little guy.
Body of a baby, face of an old man! Adorable!!!!!
"Nah, fuck this, I'll become a squirrel instead!"

Cute lil fellow.
It looks like his head already grew up and is waiting for the body to do the same
So cute! It's made even cuter by it being a horizontal video. Good job, camera person!
As if otters couldn’t be any cuter
Kind of looks like the pictures of me when I was little before I got glasses, but furry with a tail
I can confirm she utterly loved it, my little sea otter pup :)
I tried it! Now lets go back inside. 

Otter in the wotter

He looks like a tiny furry t-rex at first. So cute. Rawr. 
Not great coordination, doesn't seem to naturally take to water, small, slow, no swimming skills displayed. 

Rates out as a 2.1. Not a blue chip prospect. 
I need otters

Don't worry pup, you'll learn to love it.
Why is there no sound :'(

Wow, I’m kinda impressed how much baby otters look like strange little puppies. Makes sense why they call them pups.
What an otterly beautiful scene
Otters are water cats
ive never wanted to cuddle anything more in my life, well except my bubbas if course.
“This shits cold fuck this” 
**WHY CAN I ONLY UPVOTE ONCE?!**
This is the cutest think I've ever seen in my entire life.
Huh, I apparently seem to be water proof. Neat. 
"Ummm, that's kinda cold. Thanks, but can we go back to the house now?"
That’s otterly adoreable
"I feel like I belong here"
Might be NIPPY
Aaaaaannnd....that’s enough.

Omg..so adorably cute!
Water pupper.
Okay, I give up - this is cuter than a Pokemon.
"okay, that was fun, I'm done now"
At first I thought it was animated lol. Glad this cuteness exists in real life though.
If that isnt cuteness I dont know what is
Soon he will be an expert in the water. Swimming backward, diving into rivers head first.  He’s a professional.
Adorable sea pupper

You otter think this is adorable or there’s something wrong with you.
"Oh, that's cold. I think just a little dip, yep. I'm done. Good thing I don't live in this."
Baby otters are just furry tadpoles change my mind
Water floof tries water for the first time.
"Yeah that's gonna be a nope from me, water dawg."
I feel like this subreddit is going through an otter phase. (I love it!)
It almost seems like the baby otter is almost floating on top of the water. 
His head is so large and clumsy haha.
"Gosh, that is enough excitement for one day. Where's Mum?"
Fcuk this shit. I am going home
Oh my god. Look at that big fluffy head. 
I want one!!
/r/HeadTooBig
Oshawott used surf
This otter will soon become penguin rip and tear savage
So cute, I just want to pick him up and punt him across the river. 
It‘s pretty crazy that they don‘t have that fear of water most mammals have, I mean this otter could still drown pretty easy in that shallow water, couldn‘t it?
Humph... I‘m the other one...
"Nop, it's not an otter-friendly environment"
Nahhhh
/r/oldbabies
Awwww...now I want to see a video of a baby fish exploring land for the first time.
Is there a way to block all posts that host their vids on v.reddit?
Big Head on the beat

Why no sound tho? T\_T
At first glance I thought it was a dinosaur like animal lol
Looks like me struggling thru finals
Ok, I shared this with my mom. She liked it but she’s now worried. She wants to know where the mom or siblings are. Does anyone know more info?
I didn’t know Jenna and Julien had a baby 
Nope.
"Nah." 

"Nothing for me, I guess."
Remember people.  These cute guys will grow up to be baby seal rapists.  Adorable little monsters!
lol noob...
Haha. Nope! Take me back to the sofa 
I kinda expected more from this little guy to be honest.
Throw a ball at it... 
Looks a lot like my cat in the bathtub. 
r/gifsofotters
Why in the winter ?
Are otters not born into water? I thought that was like their natural habitat.
r/aww-ters
The seals will have their revenge...
So I liked them until my boyfriend showed me a video of an otter killing a turtle for lunch.

I DEMAND MORE OTTER VIDEOS 
One tiny ferocious predator 
How do I save this to my phone so I can show everyone?! Lol!
Roses are Red,

Ya bitch, she a thottie,

He head 2 big for he goddam body
He looks like a toy
I'm not an otter expert, but I've heard their fur is actually not water proof when they're this young and should be kept dry... but perhaps the person who has an otter knows these things better. I guess he'll be fine as long as he's dried afterwards.
What does that mean 
wow this baby boo looks like pokemon! real life one!
Tiny human exploring life before eventually deciding as a teenager that "Nah, not for me."
Omgsh! Cuteness Explosion!!!

Wotter otter
You can kinda see his tail instinctively moving the direction he's turning like a rudder.
Squeee!!!!!!!!
Did you know otters hold hands when they sleep at night so they don't float away from each other. In case this wasn't cute enough.
[deleted]
Aww. Adorable! I so want one. How are they as pets O
I love how baby animals are so clumsy. 😍
You're telling me I'm going to be in this stuff for half my life? Oh eff nah.

Nobody is going to reference Michael Scott being annoyed at everyone watching the baby otter video?? 

Smh.
Really? A baby otter? Ok, uh, count me in as "who cares?". It's not even that interesting, a baby otter. It can't even stand up. It's trying to stand up. There it goes
No coi  fish? Fuck that I'm outta here.

Stop watching this video and go watch Michael Scott’s interview as it is currently the number two clip of the day
Ever since I read an article that otters rape seals, I've disliked otters.
These motherfuckers kidnap and rape baby seals, they are kinda my spirit animal.
