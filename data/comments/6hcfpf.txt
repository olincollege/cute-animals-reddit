Chocolates are absolute enthusiasm machines. That and the fact that they love everybody gives you Oh boy! Oh Boy!

Beautiful dog :)
Labs are my favorite, such wonderful companions.

Mine will go bonkers for:
"Go for ride?" "Time for Swimming?""Go visit Mom and Dad?" "Get a Chew?" 
"Where are your Christmas presents?" and of course "Ice Cream?"
LOL

When I reach home and have to use the toilet real bad but first have to talk to the unexpected house guests. 
He is either about to receive a treat or his jam just came on.
This was the one I originally saw:

"I would very much enjoy you giving me that food you've got there"
🎶Now, if you're blue 
And you don't know 
Where to go to 
Why don't you go 
Where good boys sit?
Puttin' on the Ritz… 🎶

~Pup Astaire
The best thing about labs is that this is them mildly excited
Can someone combine this with juju on that beat? Especially the running man part?
He's waiting to find out who is a good boy.

*spoiler*
 It's him.
I also dance like **that** when I see chocolate.
I bet he's seeing food
[Oh boy!](http://i.imgur.com/89HANHg.gif)
I aim to be as happy as this dog, even if only for a moment.

God, I love dogs so much. One of my exes many moons ago had two labs: a yellow and a chocolate. Both of them were derps, and the chocolate had hip dysplasia. But the chocolate would also get really jealous every time the yellow lab got attention. The chocolate would put his head between your hand and the other dog's head when giving him pats and whine that he wasn't getting pats. Seriously the most adorable thing ever. 
My day was a piece of shit until seeing this. 
/r/tippytaps
Can someone post the source video? I really want to see the excited doggo get the treats.
My cat doesn't do that
Oh my goodness I love the excited little foot taps and that goofy, happy face!!! <3
From what I know about labs, this video is definitely slowed down.
T A P B O Y E does an excite!

I wish I was this excited about anything in life. 
Me waiting for pizza
I have never been this enthusiastic about anything in my life
Ahh thank you, I needed this r/eyebleach after today 🍫💕
I have endless hugs for dogs. Especially dogs like him.

This why cats make fun of dogs.  
If only he was a horse they build shows around his prancing abilities.
Also a good one to post over in r/tippytaps if you haven't already! Love it. 😍😍
Give the dog the damn treat already! I've been watching this for 15 minutes and still no treat?
What do we do as humans to enjoy an animal who embodies happiness? 
The floor is lava xD
Did he get what he was waiting for?
I see this dog gif every few weeks and I still upvote every time 
This is exactly why I want a derpy lab. I need to stop moving in to tiny apartments.
Kawaiiiiii
All labs are the bomb. The bestest dogs!
My old guy used to do that.  
  
Miss ya big Mo.
Please tell me what type of drugs this dog is on 
That's me on a summer day where all the ladies are wearing flowing dresses. 
Give the dog his goddamn treat already.
LOOK OUT! SHE'S GONNA BLOW!
I wish I could get this excited about anything anymore.
[deleted]
Sweet Mary Mother of Dog! My friends Bull Arab xBernese does exactly the same thing when we start getting dressed to take her out for a run! For such a powerful animal to show excitement and vulnerability is amazing. I absolutely adore seeing dogs show excitement and joy! 
Literally flinched. That's identical to what my friend's chocolab does while doing this strained whine just before jumping up to lick my face, only his clumsy ass headbutts my nose 75% of the time. I'm not super fond of hyper dogs, but this one apparently has decided to 'single white female' me. If I visit, he ignores his owners and other guests and fixates on me and follows like a shadow. There could be a party going on, house FULL of people, and he waits while whining until I come out of the bathroom/whatever door I'm behind. I have no idea why he gravitates towards me. I don't feed him snacks, and I do my best to ignore him. A dog like that should seek out extroverted high energy people, I'm totally the opposite.

I used to dislike him, but his persistent tsunami of affection defrosted my icy man-bitch heart. It would be nice not to get skull bashed every time I visit though... 
But he's alright, a total all loving clown. 
Oh boy oh boy oh boy, here I go licking again.
This makes me so happy!
I spy a good boy!
IT'S BACOONNNN
This is the best thing ever and it is absolutely making my day!!!
JUST TAKE HIM ON THE WALK ALREADY, HE'S REEEEEADY! 😂
Dang, how much meth did you give him?
That dance!  My boy Otto does that when he sees me coming up to the door, he'll dance just like that, it's the best thing!
How's it possible not to up vote this? 
We truly do not deserve doggos

TREAT?! TREAT?! TREAT?! 
My wife's Pomeranian is exactly the same
ohhhh the tippy taps
For some reason its hilarious to me when [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q65-AoZCeMM&t=3m18s) is played to the gif
That dog is basically what my mood was today.
I need to see this
OMG Doggo is so excited! :D
Labeeeeeeeeeeeee!
Happy Dogo
Have lab, can confirm.

That is one excited doggy! 
Someone shop him on a DDR pad
Oh boyo
Twinkletoes
Give him the damn treat already!
HE'S SO FUCKING EXCITED
This would be perfect if it was easier to see his hoppy paws. The dark floor is the same color as his fluff.
We really don't deserve dogs...
100% in Dug from Up's voice
I'm gonna f$cking bust. So cute.
Thank you so much. I needed this smile 
My Beagle does that when he's waiting for any food! I think he's doing it to say "hurry up, human!" because he's a rude little shit.
Sometimes I wonder why the behavior of some dogs on reddit is so quirky and spectacular and I have never seen one of my dogs do anything like this. 

Obviously my dog is my best friend im juat wondering about like dog genetics and shit. 
I was afraid this gif was gonna be perfectly looped and that I would have to watch it forever. Thank bork.
OH BOY! I wish I could have so much enthusiasm.
test
For a second there I thought it's a perfect loop :(
Don't you just wish something in your life made you this excited?

this dog needs a fidget spinner
Good boy. Behave now!

This is a direct result of not receiving enough boops per day!
This dogs  is in dire need of some boop.
This is the most dog thing I've ever seen

Yeah I used dog as an adjective 
Dinner time ?
Zoob
Okay now quickly and painless tell me why this dog has a brain parasite, is in extreme pain or whatever
Oh boy! Here I go killing again!
This is why dogs are the best !! This would make anyone smile 
This makes me wanna die omgggg
For enthusiasm and support of just about any initiative, there is just no beating a dog.
And his name was Happy Feet.
This is pawsitively awesome
Omg what a cutie
Ah the Dance. That's what my dog does. 
I love this dog. You can tell that this dog is a good dog. 
I wish I had such enthusiasm for something
Repost for karma farm 

The wife is not ready yet.
Looks like a shibu taping 
oh i know that dance, it's the way i'd do it when i'm barefoot on hot asphalt in the summer
GOOD DOG!!!
My dog every fucking time when I fill his food bowl xD
This is how my dog acts when I grab the leash
>OH GOOD BOY OH GOOD BOY OH GOOD BOY!!!
FTFY
This cheered me up immensely after having to think about Floyd fucking Mayweather again.
OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY!!!
I'm imagining a real goofy voice pronouncing the oh like "hoh!"
Thanks Reddit for making me smile 
You'd never see a cat losing its cool like this. 
If I ever met this dog and this is how he greets me, I'd be doing the exact same thing.
Some say he is still being a good boy and waiting
) Oh Boy!

Cute and adorable if a dog. 

Annoying and exhausting if a human kid. 
Looool
I love that dog  , I feel like i could give him all my food , ( i never ever share))
I had a children's computer that came with games on it and I'll always remember that monster that said "OH BOY, OH BOY, OH BOOOYYY!!!"
Ohhh yis yis yis Ohh yus yus yus Oh yos yos yos yus yoss yiss
Happy feet
Not a single running man video. I are disappoint. 
cool
If I had enough cocaine to act like this I'd be a very happy man.
Out labradooble does this - must be the lab in her!
must have seen the Black Panther trailer
Good boy.
My dog exactly when we're about to have launch.
I wish I had like, 1% of that excitement about anything.
He was let down http://i.imgur.com/I1ficdd.jpg 
This just keeps getting better. Oh boy! Oh boy! Oh Boy!
When I see angsty young people asking questions about the meaning of life: this. This is the meaning of life. 
the face of excitement 
This is what I look like when I have to pee. 
Such an old gif lmfao
That is me, when my wife says, "do you want to have sex"
I don't think I've ever been that excited in my life
Am I the only one reading this with the voice of Mickey Mouse? 
Listening to James Brown and watching this is making my night.

r/tippytaps
One of mine does this as well, but it's not a "happy" dance. It's more of an "I wanna kill that squirrel so bad and I can't reach him so I'm gonna throw a fit about it" dance. 
It's just an interesting way to explain an important fact. Don't feed your dogs chocolate!
Also, your comment almost made me die laughing
"Take on me, (take on me), Take me on, (take on me)"
That is the same dance my black lab mutt does for his breakfast.
I'm so mad he never received anything😂 r/mildlyinfuriating 
AHGGHHHHHHH why you so beautiful
Hi! I can talk! Are you my master?
Upvooootes!

Hi I'm a good dog!
My pup does something similar. He knows he isn't supposed to jump so when he's particularly excited he'll do a little bunny hop. It's adorable.
I really wanna make this the loading screen for my apps
FOOD! FOOOOOOD!! ME WANT FOOOD!! GIMMEEE FOOOOOD MASTER! ~D.O.G.
This is my favourite.
GIVE him ALL THE TREATS! 
oh my god, he looks exactly like George Carlin's impression of a dog! that's awesome.
DogChoc. How did you missed it?
For some reason I read this in Kevin's voice from the office
That dog has strong bladder control, but the pee dance can't help forever. Someone open the door!
I love this little tap dance. Our English cocker used to do this all the time. We've got a munsterlander that just spins in circles and yells at us when he does t get what he wants. 
WANNA TREAT?? HUH? HUH?? WANNA TREAT? WANNA TREAT??
35.1k ppl don't know it's a repost
My dog did the same... I miss her a lot... :(

Ohhhhh my god, I love this one

Been up since 3:45AM and didn't coffee cause this made me happy.
What a good boy
I think somebody said "walkies".
Ridiculously cute.
ahhhh you are looping the tape speed
Happy Feet much. I mean to the tea. 
Woofer excite
His excitement is making me super happy. He needs my love. Like now. 😃
This is the best.

Had a black lab/golden retriever mix. All you had to say was "walk?? Wanna go for a walk?!?" And she's go nuts tears through the house, jumping at the fridge where we kept her leash, come find you if you took more then 5 seconds to come get the leash down and bark until you got up. First few years she'd get so excited out back (in our fence) she'd pee everywhere while we put the leash on.

Miss her everyday, she was the greatest doge 
I love this dog!!! Come on give my.......
Haha, he looks like he's tap dancing! What a cutie
Upvote because it looks exactly like my chocolate lab Sam rescued two years ago who passed away from bone cancer :(
Im just imagining dunkeys voice right now
someone must had asked if the doggie wanted a treat or walk

When we were in our early 20s with my wife, we had not money and worked day and night. We were it different switches so when I was at home, she worked and vice versa. Our dog, Lurdes helped us a lot to be not alone.

My chocolate lab, cocoa, does the exact same dance. They're the best dogs!!! 
OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG
I have a little dachshund/chihuahua mix that does the same thing with her stumpy feet when it's time to be fed.  I call it the dinner dance.
A reporter waiting for the latest leak to post some fake news
This makes me so happy 
This is pure unadulterated excitement. I love how happy dogs are! Eventually you start to see the world through their eyes :)
He's the sweetest!
Omg - go listen to Moving On Up - M People while watching this .gif (honestly any 80s song will do. :) )
I'm a simple man. I see labradors and I upvote.
So happy it makes me feel good.
I need to see him get the treat!
It's been a long time since I was this excited about anything.
I hope you have him the treat after that adorable display
My Chesapeake used to do that happy dance when he was about to get a treat. I miss him very much.

Can't beat a chocolate Labrador. 
here i go killing again
I wish I could get that excited about stuff.
O H B O Y B O Y E
Floor's hot floor's hot!
wow what a Good Boy™
This is one happy pup. 
This was a perfect start to my morning. Thanks OP!
I love the alternating foot stomp.  My mini-schnauzer does it when she wants a cookie.  It's the only time I see her do it, so she ends up getting lots of cookies.
Reminds me if Dewey when he drank all the orange soda
I could watch this all day.

Gif ends too soon. Pupper is excited but there's no resolution, what's he so excited about? Does he ever get it? I NEED TO KNOW!
What I look like the one day a year I get sex on my birthday. 
TGIF!
This is my dog  when ever I pick up the chain leash
Oh I would very much like the ball master! Please give me the ball!
This makes me wanna get a pupper. ): 
This is why I love dogs... So much love and excitement.

I won't lie this very accurately describes this. 
My 2 year old pibble who I rescued only a month ago does this when I come home and it MAKES ME THE HAPPIEST PERSON EVER

That's my collie cross when I say "do you want to..." he's so smart I don't even have to say "... go for a walk", he already knows
Oh he's a GOOD BOY!
That is one hell of a Good Boy!
IT'S BAACCONNN!
Kids, don't give adderall to dogs
My dog tap dances too!!
My shih tzu does this and I always tell him he's my tap dancing boy. 
How are dogs so damn adorable!?!?
Did somebody say walk? 
What a good boyo
Give this dog his treat!
My pitbull is like this all the time. We call her a little tap dancer. We'll take her on a long walk, and she'll be mellow for a bit, but then go back to being excited. It's crazy how much energy some dogs have. 
Tappa tappa tappa tappa tappa
TIL that I am part chocolate lab. The boyo here looks like I do when I'm waiting for something important.
I could never have one of those. Their high-strung hyper is completely incompatible with my chill.
I've owned cats my entire life, never a dog. But they are pretty freakin hilarious. 

"Who's a good boy?"
"I AM, I AM!"
Shit... I don't think I've >ever< been that excited about anything in my life
The joyful enthusiasm of a dog is a delight to behold.
I hope to some day be as excited about something as this dog is about his meal.
Cuz im a maniaaaaac... maniaaac fo sho
GOD I WANT A DOG SO BAD BUT MY PARENTS HATE HAVING ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE. WHEN I HAVE MY OWN PLACE DOG IS THE FIRST THING ON MY MIND 
Omg i cant even

I needed this happiness this morning, Thank you!
Omg cuteness overload! 
I think this song is more fitting, also shows you what he's excited about

happy feet
Talk about Wag the Dog.
This reminds me of the video involving a woman stomping grapes before she falls out of the bucket. 
Someone casually mentioned the word "walk".
When you're waiting in line for French fries. 
Happy feet dance. I love this dance. My weim does this everyday the moment I walk in my house. It's so dang cute. 
Just give him whatever he wants anymore, he's going to pop with excitement and so will I!! What is it he wants?!? 
Happy Dance!
I need to know what he/she is so excited about. Have dog. Must induce this hysteria. 
I need to see what he's so excited about! 
I'm so excited and I just can't hide it!
Russel Coights back!

I love that he goes into maximum overdrive at the end
This reminds me of the alligator is Peter Pan 
Me when I have to pee but the restroom is occupied :P
Awww. This is what my dog does as well! So adorable.
hahaha the ol' Labrador happy dance, a joy to behold.
This dog is my spirit animal.
I love this
This pupper's happiness is infectious :D
He’s so excited!! ;)

*All night, I think of youuuuu*
We don't deserve dogs
DID HE GET THE TREAT OR NOT 
It's the Snoopy Dance!!!
Is the floor hot xD
Gotta get those steps in!
Looks like the puppers is at the shelter. I hope you adopted them.
This looks exactly like my dog
I will never, ever, ever get tired of watching this gif. 
oh em geeee
I was listening to David Guetta's Bad, found it oddly fitting
I was listening to 'Collard Greens by schoolboy Q feat kendrick lamar' when I saw this... it goes perfectly together!
Look at the feets!
Can someone please make this a perfect loop? I want to watch nice doggo until sleepy time.
I miss my lab. We had Shadow for 14 years. He was always in shark mode, aka never stop moving or chewing up stuff. He loved water bottle caps and cheese. He could hear the plastic wrap where ever he was. Rest in piece big guy. 
Aww doing the doggy dance! My old rottweiler used to do this when it was treat time. Love it!
my girlfriends black lab does the same thing as soon as you say walk or food
I taught this to my dog when she has to go out. I call it the potty dance. 
One question...can I have him/her?
One more day until the weekend. 
ahhh the "happy stomp"
Literally just finished my last final. I can relate to this dog
This just made my day. Thanks for posting it OP. 
that dog has a striking resemblance to eddie murphy
I think I have a broken chocolate lab. The girl is 10 months old and has yet to be off the wall about anything. Actually she is pretty lazy 
If you do have a chocolate lab you know this is par for the course for energy level.  Mine chased a rabbit when I wasn't ready, pulled the leash and snapped my ankle in half
Too too too too cute
Man, I know it's been said a million times, but dogs really are the best. 
Give him a treat already
Holy crap I just want to play with that guy!
Role model. 
Everytime I see this, I get motivated in life.
Mealtime at my house every day.
I have chocolate labs.
just saw this. thank you so much.  hug that puppy.

This is where I wish I could pull off a Facebook react. It would be love 💖
Some say he's still dancing to this day.
I LOVE YOU - AND YOU - AND AND ............WHAT????
So much joy and happy ness. Oh joy oh joy :D
I have to know what hes so excited for!
I don't think I've ever been this excited. 
Thank goodness this isn't a perfect loop, I woulda been watching for a long time
STOP! HAMMER TIME!
My dog used to do this when he was younger, we called it the "buh-bye dance". 
My friend's dog did this when she saw you pick up her tennis ball, she died recently :(
Chocolate Labs are the absolute best, paws down!!

I have a 4 year old pure bred chocolate and she has become my favorite animal in the world. She acts similar to this, and she loves using her paws to grab and touch things. 

The concept that her life is such a short period of time in the grand scheme of my life, while simultaneously I am 100% her world for her whole life, really hits home to me when I see how much of a good mood she's in all the time. She helps me be more positive in life and makes me appreciate her that much more. It's a good reminder why I try to give her the best life she can live.

Edit: punctuation
Reminds me strongly of the t-rex in toy story
He's tap dancing

I don't know why but I don't like this. It seems degrading. They're live creatures just like us - so what that we're upright, bald monkeys.
