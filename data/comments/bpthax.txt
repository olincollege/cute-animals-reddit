I've seen these videos hundreds of times but I don't care. I love them so much.
ALL HAIL LORD PIG EAR now let us eat amen
What a good genital boy on the take...

Edit- gentle*
The T-Rex doesn't want to be fed. It wants to hunt.
Right in the middle of it all, I see big pink balls, and now that's all I see.
clipping your dogs ears and feeding them to him is fucked up
Aw he‚Äôs so gentle when he grabs it!
mom said it was my turn to post this
I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say I‚Äôd travel 1,000 miles just to meet this goodest boy.
He wants to pretend like he is hunting it and killing it before eating it.
You know what's not r/aww? Cutting a dogs ears!
My dog does this and rolls on top of it as well then leaves the thing alone won‚Äôt eat it :/
[removed]
What happened to his ears?
Every time I gave a pig ear to my beagle, it was immediately defcon 1. You couldn't get anywhere near him until he finished that shit. He thought the whole world was trying to take his pig ear. He would not listen to reason. Only happened with pig ears.

Me after I receive unexpected nudes
Maybe he thinks he is getting his ear back that was clipped...
Here ya go boy it's the rest of your ear. Enjoy!  Smh
people who do that to a dogs ears are assholes.
He‚Äôs just pleased to see a full ear after his were lopped off!
His ears are cropped...
Please neuter him. ‚úåÔ∏è
My dog always does this when given a treat and I have no idea what it means.  I thought it was a dog's version of the river dance for celebrating.
HYPED!

Repost? Yes. 

Will I watch it again? Also yes.
That's cute and all, but why do people cut off their dogs ears??
Is that a bong next to the phone on the table?

I cannot figure out what did you give him. It looks like a wing from a giant bat! üòÇ
Is that a goblin ear?
Not neutered...
Ohh man what a big headed good boy!
My baby girl does the same thing and throws high up in the air. The cutest thing ever.

Oh my goodness!! Such a Well behaved and cute dog!!! Wow
Our lab does the same every time he gets a special treat. As if he cannot believe it. I think he doesn't know what to do with that.
Repost
My dog is half pit and does the same thing, I almost have to shove the treat in her mouth because her little brain is overwhelmed,  then she'll lay it down and just go apeshit.

Dogs are wonderful.
repost
Velvet Hippo!
Can someone explain why dogs act like that toward their treat lol...
Is it just me or does this dog look like Gordon Ramsay
The Thrill Of The Hunt.
*ok so this is happening... just act cool for sec, might not be 4 me... ok it for me. Nom. OHHHHH YEEEAAA BOIIIIIII*
I have an itching suspicion that the dog wants you to try and take the treat.
OH. MY. GOSH! Most adorable thing I‚Äôve seen today. Thank you for sharing!
What a happy pup! These kinds of videos can make the worst day into the best day ever!
What a fucking adorable dog.
I love how he humbles himself like "Thank you, I couldn't accept this"
If he "always" does it then let's see a couple more videos of you giving him treats.
Aww. He thinks that's human flesh.
The dog seems so sweet, it is such a shame his owners felt the need to cut his ears off and almost entirely too.
 WE NEED TO GET THIS TO 100K                                     DONT LET THE FLAME DIE OUT                                        WERE ALMOST THERE
[Dance of my people](https://gfycat.com/tallplushchuckwalla)
Only a dog with no siblings would exhibit this behavior hahaha. If there were other dogs in the house he would waste no time/not leave an unsecured prize laying around while he dances.
Why is he not neutered?
Not only is this a repost. The comments are like recomments. Fuck reddit
Be cool..

Be cool...

Be....

OH MY FREAKING GAWD! LOOK AT THIS!!!
What a goofball!
Too bad the ears are clipped that‚Äôs a pretty fucked up thing to do to a dog
My dogs would bury it in the backyard for months until it became floppy again.
the lil guy went from being chill to OMG KJBDSAKJBDJKASBDJBDKAJB
What an adorable doggo. He's so gentle the way he takes the treat. Watching this the first time I thought he wasn't interested in it. The explosion of excitement later convinced me otherwise.
Maybe don't crop ears.
Maybe get him fixed.
Doggo is not afraid to express themselves!!!
This is neat.
I was thinking you could put that Zelda music up (when Links opening any chest) but I dont think it conveys enough excitement.
This melted my heart. I wish a chew leather made me this happy, but unfortunately they just lead to confusion and a sore jaw.
My dog does this, but he chucks the pig's ear up in the air. I always assumed he was making sure it was dead
He so t h i c c
God I love pittys
My dog celebrates with me before and while Im giving the treat. He bows and jumps, and then I carefully deposit the treat in his mouth and do a little jump, which sends him into zoomies all around the livingroom before he plonks down to eat it.

If my Great Dane finds a single piece of kibble out of his bowl, he does this, pawing and swatting at it too.  I just imagine him saying ‚Äúyou wanna go, huh?  POW!  Take that! ‚Äú.
Cutest thing I've ever seen
Make sure those pig ears not coming out of china.
u/vredditshare
Stooopid dog stop making me laugh
He made a pig's ear of that
  M   m m  m  m
That‚Äôs great haha!!
Is it bad I already knew who this was going to be? I love this pup in here
I like how he quietly takes it away at first...it's like he didn't want to rub it in that he got a treat until he had some privacy lol
adorable D:
Same.
That looks like a pig ear, which my greyhound used to love. Back in the day, I'd found a wholesale "feed store" (they even had "goat chow") not too far from where I did my weekly grocery shopping, so once a week I'd buy Trailways (our grey) some treats. His favorite was what was branded as a "Moo Tube", but what was apparently a dried/smoked cow esophagus. Anyway, it was usually on Saturday afternoons when I shopped, and gave Trai his moo tube treat....but it was early Saturday evenings when my husband and I had to go to work as hosts/monitors for an online service. Trai always had to be near me, so I'd bring his doggy bed in the office with me, and he'd curl up while we worked. Sometime during the evening my husband would grumble "**G-d damn**, my eyes are watering!!" Trai would look up at us with innocent eyes and beat his tail on the floor a few times. But as the night went on, even I was cringing. Those moo tubes that Trai loved so much apparently wreaked havoc with his digestive system...he never acted sick or like his tummy hurt, but he did release some gastric bombs that could've been used for chemical warfare.
This makes me happy.
I must now do the Thanksgiving dance of my people
ü§óü§óü§ó
That dogs forehead has more muscle than my body.
He thicc
Wow, sure am glad I saw this while quickly scrolling through work. Reminded me to call the Vet before they close to make an appointment for my dog.
he do a wittle doggy dance üê∂
So cute! We had a tradition growing up, that every Saturday morning we would give our dog a pig ear like that. Right when he got it, he would head straight to the backyard where he would do a trot around the fenceline with the treat in his mouth, then come back inside and eat it. He had to show the world his treat!

Damnit I miss that dog.
I liked how he acts sort of disinterested as is to say "Well its okay I guess" Then flips df out.
He looks over like, ‚ÄúI swear Tim if you‚Äôre recording this‚Äù
My dog does this for bully sticks. I always thought she was upset or something. She'll also try to bury them. She doesn't do this with any other treats, toys, or bones. Just bully sticks.

If this is a celebration, then I'm definitely going to start buying them again!
I see that bong back there..
What happens if you take the treat mid-celebration?
Protect this dog at all costs
That treat looks fucking foul
*Hail the treat*
whats the thing he's eating? it looks strange

cute reaction though
I have never been that excited about anything in my life....
I do that when I get food too!
Omg I love this reaction. What a cute pup
My dog loves those bloody things. No lie it‚Äôll take her 20 seconds to decimate that thing.
Sound plz
That's a cute doggo celebration.
He is doing the treat dance, making sure to pay homage to the treat gods.
Repost..... Seen this loads of times.
lol my dog is a similair breed and he also does this when he recieves a  pigs ear
Aaaawww, such a happy boy <3
***SMASHED***
There's a 1 eared pig somewhere watching this video thinking, "enjoy,asshole!"
r/slammywhammies
Yup, this dog is well known and had multiple different videos on this sub. Repost, nonetheless.
u/VRedditDownloader
Ah yes, the eeeediot dance. I am familiar with this.
Call it celebration if you want, it looks like he's trying to initiate play.
I used to give my dog a few of those in a day...only to realize she'd bury them in the couch cushions XD
My dog likes pigs ears too
The treat is poison.  The dog is having a seizure.
I don't seem to get reddits unhealthy obsession with dog testicles.
/u/gifreversingbot ...
You fuckin goofy ass boy
That‚Äôs fantastic! Well mannered, well mannered, well mannered..... HOLY SHIT I AM SO EXCITED LOOK WHAT I GOT
You have no idea if he does this every time you stole this from the other 80 reposts
He must be an only dog...
This makes me happy but idk why it remains me how 80% of the time my cat ignored me after getting a treat. I usually leave it there and when I check it again it‚Äôs gone...
Oh my God I love this. What a cute dog!!!
My dog does something similar to this but he barks at his food for some reason 
Edit: he sits there and barks at it for a good two minutes before he eats
That looks like an ear üëÇüèº
Omg the excitement is real! I wanna smoosh him lol
My dog does that too!
This is so great!  Can‚Äôt wait to get home to my boy!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
What dog is this?
My black lab does this every time he gets a cherry tomato. He tosses it around for a few minutes like a doofus having the time of his life before finally eating it.
Touchdown dance!
This needs r/animaltextgifs
when my dog does this to a pigs ear or piece of dried hide it's because he wants me to tear it up for him.
Bruh what are feeding u him?
Adorable. Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è.. And this is coming from a cat person
Mine does this as well.  Throws the treat around, runs up to it again, grabs it and sets it down, jumps around, throws again...  It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs pretending to receive it over and over.
My dog does the exact same thing and occasionally picks the treat up just to toss it at a wall or her bed. I'm curious why dogs do this.
That's Brutus! And that is his pig ear treat dance.
Snack celebration !
Repost from r/eyebleach 
It‚Äôs their top post ever
That look he gives during his celebration pause is the exact same look that my dog gives me when he is extremely happy and is about to jump on you (he is very strong so he will knock the wind out of you).
Happay happy because that dog is happy.
Oh man, mine does this too!
That look good
Love it!!!!
I love them little meatheads.
My pekingese chihuahua mix does a similar dance. Very cute

When you finally leave the meeting and you found out you got a raise.
He is not celebrating. He is "killing" it.

He has earned it.
r/tippytaps
i upvote everytime
exactly what my Jack does when she gets a pigs ear
Or he thinks it's still alive and he's showing how adorably fierce he is.
He likes it because it's the same texture as a newborn child.
I love the half second where he seems to acquire a bit of self awareness before continuing to flip his shit
Makes me want to get a doggo.
My guy is half pit, but doesn't look it. Then I see pits behaving like this and I totally see the resemblance.
I was told those pig ears are not good for dogs at all. My dog loves them. Was I lied to?
He's so happy!
Can I also have that treat?
Repost?
My parents used to have an English Mastiff, Earl, who would do this when we gave him a bone. My mom used to call it dancing, I would tell him to kill it ha. When 225 lbs does this its quite a sight
Awe, what a good boy for taking the treat so gently.  I can almost hear him jumping around saying "imma good boy, imma good boy!"

Mine takes...rather snatches his treats from my hand leaving a serious amount of drool and accidental teeth marks.  Scarfs it down and comes back, looks at me and says with his eyes "where's the other one", LOL!
Such a for boy
One of the best react  videos in the web.
Between the thumbnail and you‚Äôre username, I wasn‚Äôt sure what the hell I was getting myself into. I was happily not disappointed!
I can taste the smoke on that treat
Brutusthabully on Instagram, such a cute doggie
I call dibs on getting to repost this dog next!
Happiest boi
The goodest of boys
My dog does this with pig ears too! Someone explain why?
What kind of dog is that? I adopted a shelter puppy and he does that exact same prance whenever he gets excited. They didn't know what breed he was when we rescued him.
Ooh cropped ears and a pitbull? Shocked this thread isn‚Äôt locked.
My dog usually jumps to grab a treat out of my hand and then chokes multiple times before just eating it
Look at that head. Wow.
Very inconsiderate of the treat not to play with him.
Nice bong
Congrats on keeping your hand there.
The dog is in a cult.
Aww, at least now hes got one ear.
@brutusthabully on instagram
This is great! And as a dog owner I can smell that nasty pig ear and hear the crunch of a happy dog enjoying it.
This was great, really made me laugh! Thank you for sharing!!
I could have gotten 30k karma if I stole this video and posted it here?
My dog is well mannered with food. Wont touch it unless I allow him, but he goes nuts with these type of treats that I've banned them inside the house lol
Poor guy, who cut his ears?
We always called that the treat dance.
Reeeeepost
Our shepherd celebrates just like that !
he celebrated after the treat... he is stream snipping
My beast does the same, love it!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüòÅüëçüê∂
You say always but i only see one clip. Gonna need more footage.

Mmm pig ear.
That's a nice bong on your coffee table üòè
Pretty sure those treats are causing epilepsy.
I already know how these are going to go, and I always love them anyways üôÇüôÇ
repost right?
Imagine how creepy this would look if it was a dried dog eat instead.
Final fantasy fanfare plays
‚ÄúWow, am I a good boy. What a play by me.‚Äù
That's not a celebration, that's a ritual dance for the Old Gods.
I needed to smile today.  And this made me smile.  Thank you
Lol my pibble does this too.  Gets close, then throws her head back like 'whaaaaaat?!', then dances around it.
Oh heckin' heck! The bestest boy gets a heckin'good treat!
Don't know why i'm smiling like an idiot right now! so freak'n cute!!!
My dog does the same thing but with his kibble whenever he‚Äôs feeling playful. He toss it and chase it around. üòÖ Cutest thing!
AWWWWWWWWWW
What a good dog
That good boy is gonna have stinky breath after that treat.
That hesitation: *What did I do to deserve this? Am I really a good boy?*
Shame he thought he was getting his ears back
He did it in the wrong order
Someone please do voice overs for this!
I'm pretty sure that's a cow.
This should be a fortnite emote
Ah yes, the classic ritual praying for more good boy treats
I think he must be a little confused. Like: human's have good stuff all the time and I'm not allowed to touch it. This must be a trick or a test or something.
I would too if someone gave me a treat the size of my head
Oh! You cute boy you x
r/rarepuppers
For the love of all that's HOLY dog owners - no hardwood floors.  Look at those poor paws slipping when he's tryna eat that stuff
But he didn't eat his bat wing jerky.

I can hear that sound of paws on lamimate floor when i watch this
Is this that same dog that got that spiral looking treat out of the bag and did the same thing?
Awww my Japanese Chin doggo does this too with any milk bone treats! I call it the Bone Dance.
That is one chonky boi
What kind of pupper doggo is this?
This is too funny. I just want to kiss that dog (metaphorically).
Guys wtf is this treat?Is this meat of some sort?It's driving me crazy for the last 3 months since this meme debutted...
Coy-boye.
Why do dogs do this?
that's awesome
Why do dogs so often take things so gently like that?
Made me smile really big!!
Thank you for sharing!
This is absolutely precious and hilarious. Thank you so much for sharing! :)

This seems too salty for a dog. Or is it appropriate?. Vets of reddit, help me on!
I think that‚Äôs the sacrificial dance to the pig-ear gods
I smiled the widest smile I've ever thought I could

Is he perhaps trained by Muay Thai monk's? Reminds me of the spiritual dance ritual Muay Thai fighters do before battle starts :)
Not like this is the top post all time on /r/Eyebleach or anything

I...I love.
Brutus!
Love pup‚Äôs slicked backbeats ... pupper is adorable
My chow chow does exactly the same ‚ù§
What you didn't realize was that treat was haunted and he's just trying to scare the ghosts out.
Can I post this next week?
This needs a Tony Baker voiceover.
"Oh, really? Okay, I mean, I guess I'll take it...."

"...."

"....YUSSSS"
Cuteness overload
This cracks me up every time i see it. i had a friend with a french bulldog that was very trained to not beg for treats from the table or any time else. the trainer guy said it was important once started to catch on to offer treats at certain times. im sure thats the case here. that dog looked at it and wasnt sure. he took it very gently to make sure it was really happening. and once he was sure, its the same exact behavior my friends dog would do. he would race through the house with it ,throw it around and eventually settle down for a nice quiet chew.
Definitely r/slammywhammies
My GDS dose the same thing when he gets a pig ear, however he wont start chewing on it for about a day.
Do me a favor and don‚Äôt give one of those to a dog on a long car trip
Lmao! That's adorable!
How many times will this be reposted again?
Silly boy! I love his happy dance!
Awwww. My dog always has to jump up on my lap and give me kisses to say thank you after I feed her. It is very special, and it warms my heart.
What a sweetheart!
This just assures that he gets more treats. Who wouldn't want to see that all the time?
grateful good boy
Dogs are so weird. I love them.
This doggo is doing it right. Reminds me to be more grateful. :)
Fuckin treat looks like jeepers creepers wings
Wow that's adorable I love doggies this makes me want to get one I've had them all through my yeara growing up

RIP hardwood floor
This is the funniest and most precious clip ive seen in a while. :)
Super cute!

But they lopped his ears instead of his balls. (You're doin' it wrong.).
/u/vredditshare
Great looking pit. Those ears are pricey AF. $20/bag.
Not a treat for The nostrils through, pig ears reek
What was that "treat"?
Can we get this with sound?
Now this is epic
That doggo's food rituals never fail to make my day.
That perspective. I at first thought that was a whole slab of meat. 

Also, is this your dog, OP? Was he a rescue? He seems so tentative about getting a treat, like he's expecting a double cross.
That dog has trust issues.he think the owner is gonna take it away
OMG! THAT DOG LOOKS JUST LIKE THE POKY LITTLE PUPPY!
He needs a friend .
"whose a good treat?! you're a good treat! :D"
Precious .
Big Chungus
For the small price of a pig's ear, I will show you the dance of my people.
Its like hes playing with a ghost dog or maybe the pigs spirit xD
Part of me thinks he's kinda celebrating but also kinda indulging his unconscious instinct to fight with and/or kill his food in the absence of having to do so.
Ah pig ears. My dog loved those things. Would run around the room when he got one and then just chill for like an hour chewing on it.
Where are the rest of his ears??
I appreciate that this dog didn't count his egg before it hatched. He wanted to make sure he could declare ownership before reacting. Something tells me he's been burned in the past. :P
That was great!  
I hope one day to have something that makes me that happy even if only for a little while!
/u/vredditdownloader
My dog just snatched the treat , runs to consume it on my bed and runs back hoping for some of my breakfast
And they say all pits are inbred

Somehow that reminds me of Shane McMahon

Beautiful breed.
My dog does that sometimes

In the beginning...

Dog: Oh, what's this? Thank you. \*acting calm\*

As soon as you turn your back...

Dog: Yipee! I worship my treats! \*jumps for joy\*
Looks at his ears in a mirror. "what? is this funny to you? "
Well I guess he‚Äôs just stoked to finally have an ear

I can almost hear the happy dance!
The doggo version of savoring it.
Omg what a good boy
Allow me to show you the dance of my people.
Not sure where you're from but those are no longer on the market in Indiana because many dog's have died from a blockage because those don't digest well. Our dog was lucky and was able to throw it up but it was in whole pieces. Not saying this will happen to your dog but just sharing as a precaution. Beautiful pup though!
Best thing I‚Äôve seen this week.
My god this is the best fucking cherry to mark the end of the work week. We are all this dog right now.
He's doing a ritual, stop him before he completes it
It's that good.
Mine does that too but I always thought she was "hunting" it. She plays with the cat toys nearly the same way.
I love how he gives you a little side-eye mid-celebration like...‚ÄùNow, you‚Äôre SURE you don‚Äôt want this, right??‚Äù
That tail revving up right as the dog takes the treat is just too adorable!
God I wish my dog took treats that nicely. I gotta step my game up!
He is adorableeeeee

Looks
 more like a spicy spice spice hawt sauce
Ahaha he‚Äôs unsure about it

Ohhhhh
Gentle boi....so cute hehe
God damn I‚Äôve seen this posted a million times across all forms of social media for months now
That isn't celebrating, he is showing you how he will attack you if you stop giving him treats.  He is a beautiful dog.
If no one is gonna hype you up do it yourself
That's a big ass treat
r/tippytaptaps
give him more please
L a r g e  b o y e  is very excited
Every dog I've had have this reaction when given pig's ears. Well, one of them got so scared of it he peed himself when he was a puppy. First time seeing another dog freak out about it as much as mine have done. I miss them all.
What if you take it back after that dance
Ears are cut ! Bad master!
My husky does the same thing it's adorable
I was having a terrible morning until I saw this
what a nice looking leaf.....
Omg I love him so much üòÇ
That look halfway through "what are you still doing here human?"
the only way to explain the level of cute this is, is that it's illegal.
I'm curious on what animal meat that is.  xD

Typical pittie tail....lol i love it!
HA
He looks like hes been burned in the past
Was cute for all of one second before I noticed it was a pigs ear.
the cutest thing in the world is when they're sitting down and they have no traction on their front paws and they just keep sliding and readjusting.
I love this silly
I call bs on this. 

I think that poor dog was always denied a treat. Or had it taken away after being given. You can see it is so afraid to take it. And when it took it, it walked away slowly. After putting it down, realized he finally got it.
This is what my dog does with anything I give her. New bone? This. Rawhide piece? This. Banana? This.

She also rolls all over it. So I'm sure you can imagine how quick I get to her when she pushes the banana into the carpet being excited
This is a special religion and form of worship
Same dance i do when someone brings in doughnuts
Well trained good boi
This just made me day!
I don't know one dog that doesn't like a good pig ear.
The purest thing I've ever seen.
Oh, guess it was repost time for this.
It's like you are being rewarded for giving him a treat! He's training you! 
Also, that's a frigging cute doggo, keep giving him those treats!
Oh goshum this is gud stuff r u sure

U sure? 

Okay I take

This is definitely one of the best vids about and have watched it more times than I can remember. Smiles all round
I think I see a bong on the table
Balls flailing everywhere
Oh my goodness! Our dog Willow does the same thing! All I have to do is say "easy", and she gently grabs it, sets it down, then just dances and dances!!!

Gonna giver her a treat and a belly rub when I get home. Thank you! :)
Tonight I shall feast like a king, but first I do the happy dance of my people.
This is glorious! I wish I could be that happy.
This is like the fifth time I've seen this dog on the frontpage, and I am not complaining.
My god! Put some rugs down for the good doge
My old dog (RIP) loved pig ears, except he would spend literally hours finding a good place to hide/bury them. Sometimes in the spring planting something in the garden I‚Äôd find an old soggy moldy pig ear...and he would still take the thing and bury it somewhere else. So fun to watch him walk around the yard and the neighbors tardy trying to find the perfect spot.
What a good doggo!! So patient!
Why did you clip his ears
That‚Äôs what I do when there‚Äôs desert üòÇ
Well if he's happy, I'm happy.
He‚Äôs trying so hard to play it cool, but he‚Äôs got the absolute WORST poker tail I‚Äôve ever seen.
Looks like that good buddy gets reasons to celebrate on the regular. Ol ChunkaMonk
I‚Äôve never thought of it as a celebration before. My dog does this sometimes but I perceived it more so as wanting to kill the treat before eating it... ha
The pig, not so happy.
Why did you cut his ears off?
Dude! What is that treat ??!?  Got. To. Have. It
That little side look like "you won't judge me will you human?"
What a beaut
Is that the part of his ears you had chopped off to make him look tough?
His name is Brutus you uncultured swine
"Here's the rest of your left ear"! - That owner, probably.
That drift
Oh boy the pig's ear is a brave choice.  Incoming wall of dog farts.
The goodest boy
I believe they are imaginary play fighting with their siblings the way they remember doing.
My dog flips out like this when I give him his dental chew
......yeah, the ever popular pigs ear treats....we stopped giving our doggos this when we realized what terrible dog gas was emitted following-owners beware!
And if I blink giving my dog a treat, it's gone like magic. Maybe my hand as well.
repost but i love it
"Is that for me? Am I really allowed to have that? Are you sure? You're actually letting me have this whole thing? Really? Seems a little too good to be true. Really? I have your full permission? Yeah? Definitely yeah? FUCK YEAH HOLY SHIT OHMAGAWHD THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME IM THE SHIT YEAAAHHHHH"
My dog does this but the other way around lol
"Dangerous breed"
He‚Äôs a monster! üòç
I used to buy those for a dog I had about 20 years ago. Stink to all hell. I just buy rawhide for my current pup.
Trained for years to be the Finest Boi.
So adorable!  Following on IG now.
He is so polite about it!
It looks like he is praying to it
Jesus, dog shows more gratitude than my spoiled son.

WHERE DID I GO WRONG???
what a sweet lumbering chungus
Imagine being this happy over a pig ear
Be cool, stay calm...oh shit I think it's mine..yeah it's actually for me...keep coooooool.....

Daaaaaaaance muthafucka
r/karmaprinter
Before my dog went deaf if you said "PIG EAR!" She would flip shit. Those things are delicacies.
ITT: People encourage OP to chop the dog's balls off while simultaneously being mad that she cropped its ears. Actual irony is rare to see, but it's glorious.
Every post that has a dog with balls and cropped ears turns into a moral echo chamber. 

Don't even get me started on the people debating whether or not a specific dog is a pitbull. Pitbull is **NOT** an actual breed of dog. It is a mix of any type of dog that brings about certain physical characteristics one quote says...

‚ÄúPeople say you know a pit bull when you see one, but do you really?‚Äù asked Lisa Peterson, spokeswoman for the American Kennel Club, which tracks pedigrees of dogs back to 1884.

Rather than a specific breed, pit bull is more of a generic term to describe a group of dogs with similar characteristics ‚Äî much as are ‚Äúhound‚Äù and ‚Äúterrier‚Äù ‚Äî and encompasses both mixes and pure-bred dogs"

Pit bull is not a breed. It is only the way the dog looks. A dog that looks like a pitbull can have many different combinations of lineage. 

Anyways just enjoy the damn dog having fun... My God.
Dobby is free!!
Are you feeding him bat wings??
My Newfie used to do the same thing with his dog biscuits. We called it "the cookie dance."
This is so precious ‚ù§Ô∏è
My dog gets almost exactly the same treats and he does exactly this with it, it's adorable every single time :)
I want to upvote this to infinity and beyond. One upvote is not nearly enough for this amount of heart overflow!
take it back
This is the canine equivalent of an endzone celebration.
Good boy likes play time with the dead animal treaty
Omg.... i always had to tear treats up too 'help' my pup slow down an enjoy the moment... why is it raining in my apartment?
Such good manners!
My dog did the same thing with pig ears, then he‚Äôd hide them
Oooooo whata good boiii
Every time this dog is just so happy. Why can't I feel that
Is this foo real a big threat
I must do the dance to appease my ancestors
Aww. This is my first time seeing this.
Rawr
He makes me happy

Thank you. I needed this.
wiggle worm
This is my favorite web series
I love this kind of dog. Is the American pit bull terrier
What JOY
r/tippytaps
My little dog does this too! She does it with her dinner as well, will like pick up a piece of kibble and place it on the floor then do this around it. Tiny happy growls included.

She has done it so offten that now I say "Get it Tink" or "Fuck it up Tink" and she goes even more insane. So happy over foodies.
Lob
Oh no!  He‚Äôs got ‚ÄúGood Boy Syndrome‚Äù.
He's very thankful. Aware of the situation in Africa. How all his doggy cousins don't have those treats.
Aaaaaaa it's a snek
Animals expressing joy are always fun to watch.

We'll give the cats raw chicken wings from time to time and when the Burmese realises they're being handed out she'll start talking (she rarely speaks) and going bowl to bowl waiting for the wings to be dispensed. Then there's a routine where the other cats have to wait until she's excitedly checked out all of the wings in the bowls.  If they try to eat the wing before she's finished the routine they get shoved out of the way.
That's awesome. I have two dogs but if the big one ever did that the little would've stolen the treat before the big guy got halfway through the dance.
Brutusthebully on ig
He looks like a well trained good boy.
oh, it's a r/awwwpost, isn't it?
The dance of gratitude
Hey, does you pittbul go nuts when you sputter?  Mine goes batshit and starts jumping on my and yelling at ne
You earned it. Good boy

90k Upvotes? DO you know how many times this was reposted?! Its like the fifth time I see it on this subreddit alone. Where is that Karmadecay bot...
I want to kiss that noggin.
SOOOO Cute!!!
whos a good boy
This is the absolute cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all day. Bless that pups heart. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mine takes that long to eat the thing. I turn my head and it's gone.
r/whatswrongwithyourdog
There is a lot of bottled up enjoyment. If it can't be released when getting the treat it MUST be released after it.
this dog has better manners than most people. so restrained.
How does one train a dog not to be aggressive when accepting treats?
He needs an egg for these trying times.
This is a nice celebration of this cute dog. And this dog is so good dancer too. He is dancing to get the treat. It is so funny.
i am watching this with do you know by enrique playing in bg. lol. seemed like your dog was dancing to the song's beat. hahahaha
This makes me think of Crash Bandicoot getting a gem for some reason
Pitty! Awww!!
Why you feeding him orc ears
I needed this. You do not know how much I needed this. I was crying in pain a few hours ago and now I'm crying happy tears. I wanna live just for these moments. Whoever this good boy is, may he light up a million more lives with his happiness.

Click click click click screech clickety clackety clickety clackety

Doggo stoked
Best part for me was when he glanced at OP
Pig's ears are the bestest!!
Omfg so much gold for this repost
I fucking hate pit bulls but this one is amazing!
So cute
Literally busted out laughing. That is adorable!
Almost at 100k!
Staffys are the BEST dogs. I have 2 and love them dearly.
I love that dog.  So excited to get a treat, and yet takes it so gently.  My pitbull is also super gentle taking treats.  She isn't active like that, though, since she only has three legs.
Where is this link?  I want to see more of this guy!
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs
*yakakazowa!*
I can‚Äôt anymore
Probably excited for a replacement ear
That's a big ass treat.
I squealed out loud when they started jumping around like that, the sweetest thing. A+ very good dog

‚ÄúThis? This for me?............THIS FOR ME!!! YAYYYYY!‚Äù
So nonchalant, and then...
My little dog does that too!
This dog is the master of reverse psychology
I wish I could be as carefree and cheerful as this little guy
That is the most adorable thing I've seen today.
It's like that adorable pupper from [Kitbull](https://youtu.be/AZS5cgybKcI).
Awhhhhhh what a cutie
People say those kinds of dogs are ugly and dumb but I really love them and they‚Äôre cute. It‚Äôs how they are raised that caused them to act certain ways, so good job homie

Reminds me of my wife when I cook for her.
Doggo must perform the ancient ritual of the Pig.

It‚Äôs covered in hot sauce.
My beagle loved pig ears!
