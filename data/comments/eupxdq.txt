Hey everyone, I have no idea how to add text to this post so I‚Äôm just commenting and hoping it doesn‚Äôt get buried too deep. 

Thank you for the many awards and entertaining comments. I‚Äôm honestly overwhelmed. To clear up a couple of things: 

1) I would love to let him/her in, but one of our dogs is an elderly retired hunting dog and attacks smaller animals. Our other two dogs are just very confused by orange cat and we don‚Äôt know how they would react to a meeting. Orange cat is much safer outside. Our neighbors are good pet owners who keep orange cat fed and happy, they just let it wander sometimes. 

2) The glass is one of two narrow panels on our front door. We have a covered front porch. So people can *technically* see in, but they would have to walk up our porch and squeeze their faces in between the trim on the panels to really see much. 

3) Orange cat shows up a couple times a week when the weather is nice, owners keep it inside once it gets cold so we probably won‚Äôt see orange cat until April now that we have snow cover. 

4) It IS sometimes a terrifying experience to walk past the door and see this thing looking in. Especially at night if our porch light is off and the cat gets glowy eyes. We are a little concerned it‚Äôs learning our routine for nefarious reasons.
A coworker of mine had a cat move next door. After she gave birth to twins the cat probably couldn't handle the noise, smells, etc. associate with two new babies. It started hanging out at the neighbor's house (they thought it was a stray) so they start feeding it.

The neighbors finally let the cat in, which meant my coworker thought their cat was missing. My coworker put up posters, which the neighbor saw, and the cat's whole scheme was revealed.

The cat ended up living next door, and then when the neighbor had to move to another state, they all agreed the cat would be happier in a home without children.
your remark grievously offended him, he's plotting your demise
This man speaks my native tongue...but how?
I think he's just amazed that a human meowed, and he keeps watching you for more proof!

"Seriously, guys, I'm not kidding, that human FUCKING MEOWED!!! Right at me! IT WAS THE WEIRDEST THING!!!! Just wait! He'll do it again, give 'im a sec! "
He's judging you
you summoned him
It‚Äôs your fault for probably giving him an open invite in kitty language. Poor thing is probably confused ü•∫
Let him in!
He's confused as to why you would summon him and then not let him join you.
You called him a little bitch and he's gonna get you
Shouldn‚Äôt have been talkin shit
Orange cat watches you live in sin and debauchery, and he fears for your soul
What did you meow at him?
Can anyone just look into your place through that window at any time?
*awaiting meorders.....*
" I will never forget that shit you said! "
Listen, John, I know you think it's funny, but catcall me like that in front of my children again, and my husband will shit on your lawn!
You can't say that word, that's their word.
I had a cat next door and he would say hi, then he started following me to the door. Then one day I wanted to see how far this would go so I opened the door and he came in, then he came into my apartment.

Over the next couple years, he would follow me inside when I got home from work, and he‚Äôd take a nap on me. Then I‚Äôd let him out.
Reminds me of my neighbour cat, who regularly pops in to my place just to do inspections. Doesn‚Äôt want food or drinks. He just walks through every room in my place, then leaves, like ‚ÄòAll good here‚Äô.
If a cat spoke english to me you bet your ass id follow it around too
"Come out and say that shit to my face, Dave. I fuckin dare you"
He doesn't look pleased with what you said to him.
You shouldn't make promises in cat that you can't keep.
Hello? U r cat? Me cat too.

What if OP's meow translated into cat language as "I'll fucking stab all your relatives in the night and shit on their corpses" and the cat is plotting revenge?
It's like that old joke about your dog turning to you one day and saying distinctly: "No one will ever believe you." You would be watching that dog for the rest of its life, waiting for it to speak again.
He looks very polite.
"This asshole. Invites me over for a nice meal in my (butchered) native tongue out of the blue and then just slams the door and watches me through the window?"
You told him that you are a spy for the secret underground cat army plotting to take over the world. He is suspects that you are a mole working for enemy.
If it's like my neighbor's cat, it wants to come inside and spray on things.
You may have said something you didn't intend!
How to people have glass like this in their doors?? Wouldn‚Äôt people watch you and see everything?
[removed]
Noted. "Meow" means "come live in my house" in cat language
I wonder what you actually said to him in his language.
>and just watches us live our lives

lmfao üòÇ
He's plotting revenge for what you said to them
r/oddlyterrifying
Oh don't worry, it is just waiting for the perfect moment to talk back.
He‚Äôs definitely thinking of ways to end you
'David, you spoke the bond! I'm yours now!

FUCKING LET ME IN DAVID'
‚ÄúYou said you loved me!‚Äù
"It was a normal day for Snuggles, or as normal as a day can get for a street cat at least. He was smart, he kept his distance from the humans most times, but knew that a few would give him food if he put on the charm, and he could really put it on if he wanted. Purring and nudging as the humans fed him and bumbled out their incomprehensible language. He wished he could understand them sometimes, but he knew whatever they were saying probably wasn't worth hearing.

After a searching through a particularly promising trash can, Snuggles was slinking down the sidewalk when a human he had never seen before stopped dead in their tracks as they were walking into one of their homes, locking eyes with with the alleycat. Snuggles froze, he couldn't read the expression on this human. A curled, knowing smirk rose beneath this humans eerily blank, almost sinister eyes. The human took in a shallow breath and without warming shouted out to Snuggles, "TOMORROW."

*Tomorrow...*

*wait... I understood that. Tomorrow?!?! He said 'tomorrow' in CAT!"

Snuggles was paralyzed, confused and suddenly terrified. 
Then... The human just walked into it's house.

Snuggles didn't know what his fate would be, but he knew he had to be there tomorrow..."
Let him in! :3
You should know cats counter sarcasm with even more sarcasm
Be careful. That's not a cat, that's a Flerkin.
That‚Äôs what happens when you meddle with powers you do not understand.
*i heard what you said asshole*
"What the fuck did you just fucking say to me, you little bitch?"
Dude, if you heard a cat speak English, wouldn't you check in on it now and again to see if it does it again?
He clearly wants to be friends. 

It's crazy but my neighbors' cat has free reign of our house, she made friends with us outside in summertime (we're gardeners) and one day scurried in the door before we could stop her. 

Now she comes over every once and a while stands at the door to be let in, comes in, gets some scritches and takes a nap for about an hour then leaves and goes back home. Her real people know and don't mind. They think it's cute she visits her very own friends.  

It's kind of hilarious. We love that little goofball.
I think he's telling you not to lose hope, that he plans on breaking you out of that prison somehow, soon.
This sounds like the beginning of a /r/letsnotmeet story.
/r/petthedamncat
He is the ***messiah!!!***
You've spoken to it, now it's adopted you as a part of its cat family.
Your neighbour's cat wants to move house.
I'm looking at that photo and I'm hearing Bill Burr saying, "Come out here and say that to my fuckin' face"
Cats and vampires share that similarity, he's awaiting eagerly for you to invite him into your home, at which point he will suck the very life force out of you. Except instead of sucking your blood, the cat will just suck. Hope you enjoy broken vases and china.
I did this as well. Now we have a part time cat.
Why'd you invite me in for fishies, then have no fishies and never let me in?!
Cat: You dare oppose me mortal
You said you loved me and then walked away. We need to talk about this.
he is learning
"I know your secret mantiger!"
Soon.
Just look at that malevolent smile. Do NOT let that cat in.
This is terrifying
r/oddlyterrifying
What did yo fuckin say about my mother!
Let him in! Do you make all your house guests sit outside?
Hello. Who are you? All your curtains are open, you want me to see you, to listen to you, to know you, and I thank you¬†- Cat Joe
Well he wants to come, so let him in and give him some food or treats.
LET HIM IN!!
Cats only really meow to communicate with human friends for attention. So by this logic he believed you declared him as a human friend.
Next time he does this try mouthing 'meow' and see what he does!
This is my life meow.
It‚Äôs the peeping tomcat!
He sits with the jowls pulled back. Ears perked out. 

Flustered at the thought of treats and sweets. But no. Just cold seats.
"You summoned me, I came"
Pennywise the cat. He knows your dirty little secrets
Let him in
Always be nice to the orange kittys, they‚Äôre the best ones!
Someone's knocking on my door, somebody's ringing the bell. Do me a favor, open the door- Let him in, oh yeah!
the kitty clearly wants a second home, let it in for a visit
Human: ‚Äúmeeeooooewwwww‚Äù

Cat: ‚Äúweird request but okay‚Äù
If you were walking around and saw a random cat that looked at you and said ‚ÄúHi Dave!‚Äù, you‚Äôre gonna try and find this cat again. None of your friends would believe you. You would question your own sanity. You would become LASER FOCUSED on that cat, and if you knew where he hung out, you‚Äôd spend an inordinate amount of time waiting there, hoping that he did it again, if only to know that you‚Äôre not crazy.

I think that‚Äôs what happened here. You said the equivalent of ‚ÄúHi Dave!‚Äù to this cat instead of the normal nonsensical bullshit noises we normally make, and have truly fucked up this dude‚Äôs understanding of the way things work.

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, you might be in act I of a buddy comedy. Keep an eye out for feeling too old for any particular shit, as that‚Äôs almost *certainly* the variety of shit you‚Äôll be encountering more of in the immediate future.
He is grooming you to become his 2nd family.
#Challenge Accepted!
Aww, lil orange kitty. :)
He speaks the language of the gods.
Picking a new pope in case the Exxon/Monsanto-thing falls through in Africa. Run a 199 on a possible Dolittle. You f***ed with cats, Morty! We've got a good five minutes before they're back and up on our ass, Morty! We have to pack up and move to a new reality, Morty!
You summoned him, he awaits your invitation to enter your lovely abode
Your "meow" translated to "I got your weed right here!"  Give it what it wants!
You meowed help and he is worried now?
"Say what one more time muthafucker" - Cat
LET HIM IN YOU MONSTER!
It's now a shared cat. Take them to court to figure out how custody will work.
Little did you know your little "meow" was declaring a life long contentment to marriage to said cat.

üòÇüòÇ
let him in.
Let him in for a cuddle and spot of tuna
"I've just about had it with your shit karen" that cat probably
You never meow at a cat until you‚Äôre fluent in their language. You probably, unintentionally, called him a stupid ginger and now he‚Äôs pissed. I made a similar mistake with a black cat on my block and it was awkward for the last few months I lived in that neighbourhood.
‚ÄúYou let me in right meow!‚Äù
"Remember that time you talked shit? I do."
Congratulations on your new cat!
He now thinks you're secretly a cat in disguise and checks if you have already turned back yet, every time he is in the neighbourhood.
Open the door.
Let it wander around.
Cats like to gain new territory.
"what'd you say to me you little bitch"
"What are you waiting for kid?"

"I don't know, something incredible to happen"
A peeping tom... cat üò¨
Let him in
"Where is my lasagna, Jon ?"
Don‚Äôt be a monster, let him in.
"I swear, Francis, that Human *spoke*! I'll catch him in the act again 1 day, just wait!"
Cat: "I *heard* what you *said*."
He thinks there is another cat in the neighborhood since you meowed at him,now it's just asserting it's dominance to make it clear who's the boss around here.
Well obviously you have a cat now
My cat gets confused who‚Äôs house to return to when I let him out. I always find him waiting at the neighbors front or side door to be let inside ‚òπÔ∏è
Are you a cat posting to reddit ?
Just like a horror movie
Surveillance cat
Contemplating if you can serve as backup mommy.
You have *summoned* him
What kind of door is that ?
Wow must have been the most accurate meow. Cat really wants to meet you!
Let the cat in.  He probably thinks you‚Äôre some kind of hooman/ cat hybrid.    You‚Äôve innocently messed with it‚Äôs head you should let him in and let him to dispel his curiosity.   He‚Äôs probably dying to know what your deal is.   Let him in.
Thanks internet, I needed this.
there's this frosted glass film you can buy from home stores and amazon that deals with these kinds of weirdos.
"he just likes to watch"
‚ÄúLook mate don‚Äôt just stare at me and say ‚Äòhey there cutey‚Äô and then walk away... I don‚Äôt like mixed signals‚Äù
He looks like you owe him money.
Love it.
I think this is more scary than cute, better hide, this cat's got a plan of revenge.
This cat makes me very uncomfortable...
That cat's face reminds me of the distorted face of the "oh no, cringe" cat
Someone edit in rain.
Your meow meant "hey if you ever need free food, come over" ...
Let him in
You said valar morghulis in cat.
You unknowingly invited it over for catnip. It‚Äôs  mad you won‚Äôt let it in to join in the fun
This is my face looking into other peoples lives.
He's told a dozen of his best cat friends that you speak their language and none of them believe him!
"you still talkn shit bro?"
Give him just a little salami
Just let him in.
let him in
you impressed the cat with the meow, it's now in love with you
RIP /u/GreenLigh he always meowed back.
Invite in him
SOON
You offered to let him join with the wife.
Someone is feeding it...
...kind of unsettling, but still cute
Meow, you said.

Come, we played.

Days, they fade.

Here, I wait.
Please let him in and giv pets thanks
I feel like that cat may have a side quest for you.
What a Purrrrrr-vert
Its stare is saying "I know what you did last summer."
Cat‚Äôs tinder profile: ‚ÄúI enjoy regularly viewing humans in their natural habitat‚Äù
Looks like you've got a peeping tomcat!
Let the fucker in, ffs!
I love you for meowing at the cat and for posting this.  Thankyou for spreading happiness
When my son was in his teens, there was an orange cat on our street that was obsessed with him.  I had to be careful when heading out the door because a few times the cat managed to rush past me, up the stairs and sit right in front of my son's bedroom door meowing his head off.  It's the only time I ever saw my son try to get around his OCD by pulling his sleeve over his hand to accommodate the demands for pets this cat required.  No interest in me at all, btw, and I even kept treats in the house for his random visits.
He's a vampire, don't invite him in!
Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm not a cat person but this picture horrifies me like genuinely disturbing
"Dude...what the god damn FUCK did you call me? Hey! Hey, bitch I know where you live! I didn't do shit to you...oh you're ignoring me?! Motherfucker...Oh and now you think this is cute, what the hell is wrong with you, man? I was licking my balls, minding my own shit and you call me a fucking "Kitten molester'?! THE HELL, MAN! I'm staying right here until you give me a fucking reason for that uncalled for BULLSHIT!"
Can someone give me a summary on how life with a cat is? I'm a pretty introverted person and I haven't had a cat or dog before. I had a guinea pig growing up but when it passed away my dad was so sad he didn't want us to have any more pets.

Anyways, I feel like sometimes cats just kinda do their own thing while dogs will attack you with love. What are the ways in which a cat will show you love? How do I interact and have fun with a cat?

(this is not meant to be me trying talk shit about cats. I actually just want some advice on how I interact with them and have fun with them. I've really only been around my friends cat at times and she'd just kinda chase around the string type toys i'd have in my hand.)
Ohhh let the poor baby in ! üòª
I love this much more than I should.
You probably said something fucked up
He's playing the sims
This cat has a private zoo, and your home is an exhibit.
You probably accidentally told him that you have a voyeur fantasy so he wants to help you out
He wants in, or food, or both.
Let him in and give him foods.
He‚Äôs memorizing your schedule for when he‚Äôs ready to strike
Wow u must have really insulted him...or wooed him
Now you have to wonder just what you said to him...
That's no cat friend.
You fool, now he knows your routines
He knows what you said last summer.
"Do you bite your thumb at *ME* sir?"
Reminds me of our neighbor‚Äôs old tabby cat named Kitty. Everytime i‚Äôd see him and meow at him, and he‚Äôd meow back. Rest up Kitty :(
"he speaks the old tongue.  He must not live."
MurderByMittens has joined your party
Bet it's thinking "But your meow was inviting me in..."
He's just coming to the human zoo.
‚Äúdude, are we on tonight or what?!‚Äù ‚Äì cat
Oh, he wants to come in.  What a little beggar.  I wouldn't be able to say no.  I wouldn't steal him but I'd let him visit.
My neighbors cat regularly comes to our terrace door and bumps his head onto the door repeatedly until one of us opens the door and gives him a little salami. He keeps on knocking with his head that I‚Äòm a bit worried that he is going to hurt himself so I‚Äòm kinda forced to open the door. But I love him he‚Äòs a cutie.
You shouldn't meow at cats. You might be saying "Come over to my house every night and I'll give you a big fish dinner."
You likely offered free catnip in Meow.
The next door neighbour's cat occasionally comes up to the back door (full window) and just looks in to see what I'm doing in the living room. He spooks easily, so he'll only do it if I'm reading, playing video games, or watching tv in a relatively still way, and if I ever look over he bolts.

I find it funny that I'm part of his "cat TV" plan on his usual route through the neighbourhood so I leave the blinds cracked a little for him.
I've never understood why doors have glass windows so close to the door knob. Someone could just break that then quickly undo the locks. Irks me everytime I see one
He's a peeping Tom cat.
Open the door he‚Äôs so cuteee ü•∫ü•∫ü•∫
He's a /r/hitcat and you unwittingly asked in perfect kittonese for protection from bandits.
You gotta come out sometime bitch
Anyone here NOT meowed at a cat?
Hes like "I DARE you to say that again, motherf√ócker"
Bro I just meowed at my cat and she meowed backs and glared at me
Cat: "You sonofabitch! I know where you sleep. You'll rue the day you crossed Mr. Fluffles!"  
OP: "Hon, our neighbors cat is weird."
"Well, you called me, so what the hell do you want?"
Similar story happened to me: I pspspsps the neighborhood's cat one time, now he's always at my door BUT he yells at me like there's some kind of demon trapped inside of him. Sometimes he sounds like a crying child
Ok so i finally met someone who meowes at cats to üò∏
I wish these were my humans
A cute pervert
Let him in
That cat just wants you to know he knows what you said, he knows where you live, and he remembers.
I think you insulted its mother...
How cute
That's a pretty meowable cat.
plotting ur dedness
Is it a peeping Tom
*cue detective pikachu ‚Äúyou can understand me? I‚Äôve been so lonely!‚Äù
LET HIM IN YOU COWARD!
Since now i will love cats
Let her in
This is why I don‚Äôt understand why women are always complaining about cat calling.
It's like the cat is watching a Huge tv series
He looks very polite.
He‚Äôs like ‚ÄúI swear I heard him saying to come by‚Äù
I knew someone who had a goat like that. It kept jumping the fence to go over to the neighboring property and would watch the people through their sliding glass door for hours until someone came and got him.
I befriended a yard cat the same way once, lol. For a couple weeks I would see him flee the yard and stare at me suspiciously from the wall until one day I meowed at him. He was like, "Oh you speak cat! Why didn't you say so in the first place!?"

Proceeded to jump down from the wall and trot straight over to me. Showed up every day for months to be petted right as I got home from then on, lol. (Pretty sure his owners moved away eventually‚Äîhe would have a collar occasionally until he could ditch it again.)
He wants to free your inner cat
Reminds me of my cat.  We meow at each other and he likes to stare through the glass on my door when I'm in the other room. Love my baby
"You said you were a cat!" - Cat
Let him in
Let him in
Cat: "Remember that one time?" " Die hooman!!"
Whiskey Hangover,  what are you doing? Get over here!
"How dare you meow at me!"
You invited it over for dinner and now you won't open the door and let it in. Who's the jerk meow?
don‚Äôt fuck with cats
Food. You got food? How bout head scratches?
Maybe you insulted his family and now he's watching silently you waiting for the perfect chance to strike.

The very small grin the cat does makes this even better, like it's saying to himself : "Your time has come, hooman, I will soon have my revenge. NYE HE HE HE HE HE HE".
Problem is you dont know what you said to him
This is hilarious. I feel your picture.
It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre in an exhibit in a zoo!
He just wants snacks now that he knows ‚Äúyou are one of us!‚Äù
Whatever, that‚Äôs your cat.
You‚Äôve summoned him.
I greet any cat in our yard with either  a friendly "hello meowser" (my made up word combining mouse-er and meow) or "hello meow meow." It's cute to see how they react. You can tell when they aren't used to conversing with humans on a regular vs. the ones whose owners must jabber all the time.
‚ÄúTell Daphne to run a 199 on a possible Dolittle.‚Äù
You called his name.  Now the overlord has come.  He is destruction.
Pet the damn cat!
"fuck these cats are weird"
He has a quest for you
Lmfaooo
S+ tier baby
"Hey!... (slow) I'm watching you!"
Let it in
 H E  S E E S  A L L
Probably cause you said, ‚Äú biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitch‚Äù in cat. Now it‚Äôs planning your imminent destruction.
Let him in. Give him a snack. Look how polite he is.
Do you have little a salami?
I love how he is looking through the glass with such purpose
Invite them in
I have a fat cat that shows up whenever I open my car door and then it proceeds to vibrate and rub against my feet and shins. 


It's weird af, but I bought a giant bag of cat food and toss a handful to him whenever he shows up.
" we had a deal"
A W W W W W W W W W.
Did you let him in?
Obviously not observing. Asking to be adopted. Or at least fed...
let him in
He knows you have kidnapped his friend and wants answers.
Let him in :D
What did you say to him?!?!
He heard the call for pets and now he is here to receive or perish the humans who made the wrong call
Ma... there's that cat out there..
[deleted]
A pact is made, your life is protected
LET IT IN üëè
Aw, let the kitty in...
In cat language your plaintitive "meow" was the equivalent of a challenge.
Do you let him enter?
Cat: *while sharpening its fangs* ‚ÄúI request that you let me in mortal human.....I wish only to converse with you‚Äù
"Please I must see how this other cat has disguised itself to the human world"
Similar but not. I have a dog and 2 cats. Always some shenanigans happening in our house. There is a possum who lives next door in the empty duplex. Sometimes, I catch him just sitting on our fence and staring into our house. I think we are his "TV".
Peeping Tom cat
He works for Big Brother
Cats are video cameras of the aliens. Beware!
fbi cat
No, jerry stay away. It's the same talking cat.
So the cat does it and it‚Äôs cute, but I do it and I get a restraining order?
Let him in
I dont know why but this made me smile
Cat does this = cute. Human does this = creepy.
His eyes are dialated and his ears are forward so from my cat knowledge that means he‚Äôs interested. Guess he‚Äôs cautious tho because no squinty eyes üëÄ
That‚Äôs sweet!
Don't ghost on that cat!
Glad to see someone is fluent in "cat".  Whenever I meow at cats, I get a head turn, followed by a prompt ignore.
You spoke his language.
I really love the title of post, really ties it all together.
He's waiting for the rest of the story.
What you really said to him was ‚ÄúHELP ME‚Äù
Let the right one in.
Maybe it's looking for second dinner?
Must of said what the cat wanted to hear.
Let the poor guy in...
Huawei create spycat like this in China, tiny cam on it. Careful haha
Why did you tell him there was a giant fish if you weren't going to share
That is so cool--and what a sweet, inquisitive face üòÅüíó

A friend's cat used to routinely sit on a beam outside his downstairs neighbors' kitchen window and just watch them for long stretches of time. üòÑ
I will never forget what you said to me...

*Never*
Let that baby in
Looks like you got yourself a new cat. Congrats!
Next time keep your meows to yourself. Maybe you insulted their momma?
Jeez man, what did you say to him?!?!?
LeT hiM IN!!
Invite him in
‚ÄòYou think you can fucking mock me, Greg? YOU JUST WAIT.‚Äô
Shame on you for inviting him over then shutting the door in his face.
You agreed to buy Cat scout cookies!  Open up I have Meow mints to sell to the other neighbors!
You: the meow version
Does it have popcorn
This looks like a deleted scene from Parasite
Ya gotta watch out what you meow to a cat...you might actually be saying something like ‚ÄúHey Red, wanna swing by later?‚Äù
Let him in for a little while.
He or she wants to be part of your family.
He wants in.
Let them in
What do you think you did to him? First you confessed his love to him and now you don't even let him visit you. You soulless bastard.
What in the world did you put in your ‚Äúmeow‚Äù?

Look at the result.  Hmm. He is cute.  Just exactly how‚Äôd that meow go? üò∫
You are suppose to let the cat in and give it food.
Legit cant stop looking atvthe precious little babyyyy I love cats so much ‚ù§
I‚Äôm just imagining what you‚Äôve said to the poor cat,
General cat look every evening at the demons raising in my doorstep or they will execute you painfully and all of your family!
The sims cat lol
Or maybe the cat thinks you were talking some shit and wants to fight you meow.
This is why you need to become more fluent in cat before you start throwing words around all willy-nilly. Who knows what you said to him. It might have been "Come by for dinner, you're welcome anytime." Or you may have said "I really like midday naps and could use some company."
Now he's just confused.
Never underestimate the power of 'Meow'.
Did you ‚Äúmeow‚Äù or ‚Äúmrowh‚Äù? Think carefully. This cat wants to fuck or fight. Either way, be prepared.
He looks polite. The smile. Let him inside.
Birth of a meme?
Let him in
Had a little gray neighbor cat do the same. She would come into our garage and snuggle up to kids playing in yard. Thought she was just friendly until we noticed her digging in trash cans and was outside on a below zero night. Turns out POS neighbors kicked her out because she didn't get along with new puppy and had stopped feeding her. She was starving and we began to feed her and just before we went to find some kind of insulated shelter for her, the other neighbor told us they "got rid of her". Idk what happened as they do not and have not spoken to us in 5 yrs of living next door
" WITNESS ME"
That cat is pissed. You must have meowed a really bad word.
My neighbors have a little cat flap in their sliding glass door. I routinely see one of my cats trying to break in their cat flap. I don‚Äôt know why. We feed him and spoil him. He still wants to go hang out with them. I dunno.
He wants in. Cats like to have a few houses to call home.
What did you tell him?
You probably meowed "stop by anytime, we have all your favorite snacks" without knowing it. Poor little guy's just trying to cash in on your promise and is probably thinking "WTF is this guy's end game?"
That's because you insulted his mother. He's watched and waiting for his opportunity to fuck your shit up.
Do you want a demon? Because that's how you get a demon.
Why won't you let him in and document his actions :3?
Hello, fellow meower-at-cats! ü§óüò∫ü§ó
Is this Stephen king's new cat checking out the neighbours?
One of you is honoring the commitment you made that day.
Well don‚Äôt be rude let him in
I have a rule. I don't look dogs or kids in their eyes. Once you give them attention, they don't leave you alone. It's cute for a minute, but then they get needy. Apparently, it's the same for cats.
Evidently you spoke its love language. I wouldn't open the door though üòÜ
So glad im not the only one who is dr.doolittle and ralks to animals
He wants to have a word with you about the way you said Meow, he felt there was a tone to it.
The cat is like - I am bored now I am gonna watch this TV show.
Looking for that cat who looks like a human.
Check it for a wire.
You must have meowed something really bad
I thought this was my cat. He very often makes him self comfy in the neighboring houses. He is very friendly but also an ass...
You sang the song of his people. Now you are one of them.
Your are it's zoo
Cold kitty
He wants in!!!  Poor thing
You have insulted my father, now prepare to die!
"Dafuq you say to me?!"
Give him snackums!
He just  wants to finish the conversation you started...
That's cute and creepy at the same times, nice!
What the fuck did you say to him?!
‚Äú...Mother?‚Äù
Let him/ her in
Op " meow "

Neighbor's cat shows up infront of op's door wondering why the fuck op still hasn't given him the cookies he promised.
You‚Äôre my human now Dave!
I may have to sue you. I can't stop laughing and I might suffocate lol
Probably wondering what cat breed you are hahaha
Cat is like ....". You started it "
Umm..Maybe you cursed him in the meow language. He's here for a come back.
My neighbors three black chickens roam around our block during the day, foraging.  One day I fed them sunflower seeds and now they peck at my side door with their beaks like they are knocking until I give them treats!  It's so funny.
What did you say to this cat?
I would give him a cat cushion to chill on, that concrete must be hard on the royal toe beans.  Maybe raised so he can adopt a regal sphinx pose.
FEED IT
Plot twist, you said something extremely prophetic in cat and now you have your first cult follower.
I meow at pretty much every cat I see and none of them have decided to stalk me, dammit!
He watches your every move, planning your routine that even you don't know about. It waits, patiently, and silently, for the perfect moment to strike. The need for revenge courses through his veins because of the dishonor you brought to him.

...

"Ouch, wtf, that cat bite lol. No! Bad cat! No threats for you tonight!"
Personally I think he looks very polite.
Cat -"I'm going to GET you and your little DOG too!"
Ah yes, well unfortunately when you meowed at said cat, you unwittingly invoked a specific clause in the cat contract. 

Next time, be more careful about requesting that a cat conduct a thorough analysis and inventory of both the treat and petting potential of the property.

And this poor bastard is trying to fulfill the terms of the contract from *outside* the house? Now that's dedication.
It looks polite, let it in.
He looks like whatever you meowed to him was a taken as an insult and now he wants you to come out and fight him
Hell yea now he is studying your every move waiting for the perfect time to cash them checks your mouth been writing
Pet the cat!!!
You know have a new friend.
She‚Äôs just waiting for the perfect time to attack you with love.
Must pet HIM
Let him in give him snacks he is your guest
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a cat. I‚Äôm on to you, you fucking 5‚Äô6, upright standing fucking human being. Meow at me again. I fucking dare you. I fucking dare you. ‚ÄúMEOWWWE‚Äù
"Say it, say it again! SAY MEOW ONE MORE GOD DAMN TIME YOU COWARD!"
That polite look on its face, maybe it wants to move in with you. It knows you speak meow.
He's probably well fed but bored at home. Some people "care" for their cats but don't do much else with them.  Your house probably looks a lot more fun to him :)
Probably just hanging around waiting for you because of the nasty name you called him in catspeak.  Cat is "cash me outside, how bout dat".  Be careful.
*Soon...*
Awe that is adorable!!
This is too cute! Maybe the cat was drawn to the attention you initially gave it, and now it wants that again, which is why it keeps coming back. Or, it's possible that it's hungry, cold, or hurt and wants somewhere safe to stay. Do you ever let it inside your home, or do you leave any snacks outside?
This is my life meow.
He wants to be friends
He looks so mad
Most here just defaulting to the "insulted and now plotting your demise" bit just because it's a cat. Sheesh the stereotyping here.

Chances are you accidentally said to him to come in to hang out, and now it's confused since you have the door shut and locked
"I was always told that humans are just dumb brutes, that they will never have the ability to speak. But three years ago, one did. A human spoke to me. That one word changed my life forever, and now I spend my days trying to convince it to speak more. One day, perhaps all humans will speak properly, and we can live in harmony until the Ninth Life ends. All on the back of that one word."
Are you insane let him in
Let that poor baby in and feed it something. (Yes, I live in Tennessee. Yes, we over feed everything.)
the comments are hilarious, you need to give him a treat or some food now that he comes, how could you not ?
i feed some strays everyday after work on my way home so I always have cat food in my trunk, every now and then when im walking back to my car or whatever i will see a random cat and yell MEOW and they usually walk right over and i feed them its pretty cool
Oh god what have you done
Lmao what did you say to him?
He wants to talk to you about what you said about his mother
Neighborhood watch going to more subtle methods
goddamn just let him in!!!
Soon...
It's a spy for the government they have eyes everywhere
He's like "I know you're secretly one of us brother/sister. Why don't you leave them behind?"
He has to observe the mysterious cat disguised as a human.
You insulted him in Cat,and now he returns to see your demise.
You gonna let me in?
Kitty says you have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting. üôÄ
"I remember what you said about my mother, bitch!"
So cats don‚Äôt meow at other cats, they communicate through body language, with the exception of kittens, who meow. It‚Äôs thought that cats look at humans as being large kittens, which is why cats often try to teach their owners how to hunt via leaving half dead animals on the porch, etc. my guess here is that by meowing at the cat, it now thinks if you as another baby and does this because it‚Äôs concerned for you.
You offered him a BJ in "Catonese" he's been waiting ever since
Noone here thinks you did this once.
The main thing is not meowing at the neighbor!
Aww more like aww (bad word for solid output from a human) here we go again
Wonder what you meowed to him, maybe you proposed to him and he said yes. You never know
He‚Äôs asking for catnip
Looks a bit judgey there mate
LET ME IIINNN
Heard you talkin shit Karen. Watch your back.
Let me in! LLEETTT MEEE INN!!
Let him in!!
‚ÄúYou think this is a fuckin joke, Stephen?!‚Äù
Dude, what the fuck did you say to him?
That cat is judging you.
Look at that smile
Mald, looks like the pet graveyard cat
Careful who you cat call.
OPEN THE DOOR
Whomst has summoned the almighty one
Judging by the cats I know, he probably wants food.
*Meoy?*
The cats work for the bourgeois.
tonight. you.
I call this move "Waiting for a sucker".
Literally a peeping Tom (cat).
You're his version of reality TV.
he seez the end and your family is in it
I would let it in and give it a stroke üòú
He nosey.
He just wants to be included : )
He wants in.  Do you let him come in and visit?
Let him in, he was your neighbours cat now hes yours. Your meow probably sounded like "hey i have some treats and a nice, warm blanket".
"Do you have a minute to talk about our lord and saviour?"
This is beautifully wholesome.
Let him in
[This feels familiar...](https://tenor.com/view/hello-all-jim-friday-night-dinner-hello-all-gif-11985011)
Cat is judging your furry butt for cultural appropriation. /s
Those are the easiest door frames to break. Sometimes you just have to push hard.
‚ÄúI know they are keeping you prisoner in there comrade‚Äù
mEoW
I love this so much
Prime r/notmycat material
Where were you when the cats began replacing us? It was the first step of their takeover.
May Khajiit tell you about our lord and savior?
Lil guy would want to watch his curiosity
He‚Äôs just vibin
‚ÄúWhy did you do that?‚Äù
Let him in damn.
Good looking cat
My neighbors cat does this. He comes over at night and watches us eat dinner and then leaves when we are done.
[Let the Right One In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICp4g9p_rgo)
Let. Him. In.
Invite her in.
What did you say?!
definitely a goa cat
You sound like a fun person. Want to hang out?
You are a dead man
Go outside and show him some love you fucking monster. Cats don't just approach anyone, they are not dumb like dogs
Just give the cat little a salami already
DOES THE CAT BITE WORSE HE JUDGES YOU
Look how happy he is
He wants inside to rule yours.
r/petthedamncat
Wow that weird but oddly satisfying to see a cat watching you.you will only see that often in your life
"Remember that time you promissed me tuna?"
"Come out and play brother."
It looks mildly annoyed with you.
Let him IN
Mroww rowww mroww roww mroww
Ah yes one of the early surveillance models . A CX-92 if I‚Äôm not mistaken
That cat is a spy, specially trained for thieves
I wonder what you said to him.. must have ticked him off. I'd seriously watch your back dude.
Well you said something in there language
go out and give him food in some where away from home
You've said something unforgivable
You‚Äôre on the list. Better call and say sorry,  before he carries out his ultimate plan.
Man.. imagine the things that pets see with their eyes. They can't tell anyone about anything so it's all okay.  If you get caught eating food off the floor by a pet, it's okay. If you get caught butt naked by a pet, it's okay. If you get caught killing a human because they fucked your fiance because we were on a break but I didn't think that she would go fuck another person but she did, it's okay. 

Pets are cool
Careful, OP. It seems you have a peeping tomcat.
"You speak the common tongue...one of us one of us"
Bruh what did you say?
That's definitely a please let me in face.
LET HIM IN, LET HIM IN, LET HIM IN
Toveyah
Let the cat in.
"I'm never gonna forget what you said, JERRY"
My fianc√© made friends with our outdoor neighbor cats and now it walks in front of the house and we go out and hang out with it every time we catch it on the security cam.
He's just checking in to see if you are still talking that shit.
Little did you know when you meow‚Äôd you called him a bitch.  Now he‚Äôs looking to fuck your shit up so you know he isn‚Äôt a punk bitch
You invited him probably in catish.

Well it isn't complete joke. I don't know catish too much,but i understand my cats meows and gestures a bit.Even if not invited already this cat is intrigued.
I found your message, recorded on your ring doorbell. 

It translated to, ‚ÄúI love chicken, I love liver, meow mix meow mix, I deliver‚Äù
You owe that motherfucker money stop lying.
It now thinks you are a cat just pretending to be a person and seeks to learn your ways.
‚Äú I heard what you said Gary!‚Äù
Let me in!

#LET ME IN!!!
lol

&#x200B;

Peeping Tom-Cat?
This looks a lot like my cat who does the same thing to our neighbors.... are you my neighbor?
Saw the post and fully expected it to be in r/britishproblems!
Well imagine living among huge weird looking aliens who feed you but you don't understand a fucking word that comes out of their ugly faces, and suddenly out nowhere one guy from out of nowhere says "wassup?"... that would raise a lot of questions that you'd want answered. 

So you start following these aliens home and try to talk to them again but they just ignore you and act like they didn't just speak your language. I'd get pissed off and wonder if maybe I was going insane or pranked by these ugly fucking creatures.
Lmaooo kitty staring into your souuuul, it knows my man it knows. No more step mom vids for you
You mistakenly said "Dinner is ready at 6 everyday" in cat speak
so, you really can't feel the telepathy?

hum, must be working.
"I remember what you said to me you utter trash. I hope you sleep with one eye open and with your shoes locked in a cupboard! That's right bitch, the second you're not looking I'm SHITTING IN THEM!"
Planning for your demise.
I wonder what you said to him. He looks pissed off lol.
"Hey, remember that one time?

...what was that?"
Cat‚Äôs are the worlds shittest animals!
We die at dawn

[Edit: better meme]
Cats aren‚Äôt ‚Äúit‚Äùs bruv
You know his true name
‚ÄúHow the fuck do you know my language‚Äù
*H E   K N O W S*
We‚Äôve got a cat that comes up to our back sliding glass door every morning and scratches at it to come in while staring at our two indoor cats. They are, in turn, fascinated by their friendly visitor who scratches to come in and rubs affectionately on the glass at them. 

At first I was worried he was a stray but I‚Äôve begun to suspect he‚Äôs just a neighbors cat. He doesn‚Äôt have a collar but he:

1.) Only appears during certain hours of the day when a human might reasonably be expected to have let the cat out

2.) Is a chonker, clearly well fed

3.) Seems familiar with how to signal wanting to come into a house 

I‚Äôd love some tips for figuring out who this cat might belong to. He‚Äôs got no collar to attach notes to, and I‚Äôm afraid that if he does belong to someone I would worry the owner by ‚Äúabducting‚Äù him to go check for a chip. Our neighborhood is pretty large so it‚Äôs not like I can go door to door asking. I guess maybe I could put pictures up?  Not sure, and I‚Äôd rather not introduce him to our cats without knowing he‚Äôs vaccinated, even though all involved parties seem curious rather than aggressive.
"you had me at meow"
Whaaat
It looks very upset...
Let him in, you know you want to.
Let him in!
Do you give him any treats, snacks? Bc that‚Äôs why he coming over. If you don‚Äôt why not? Give him a damn treat if you aren‚Äôt going to allow him in as a guest.
Let him in so, he can get better angles!
awww that`s so adorable but on regular basis then i doubt if its spy cat spying on you
looks to me like he is asking to be saved from your horrible neighbors
Whatever you said, you need to open that door and pet that head to make amends.

Orange kitties are the sweetest kitties.
You knew the secret cult's name, now it wants you dead, as you know their secret.
You said the magic adoption word ;)
You are the fish
I hope the cat isn't freezing.
cat: meow (hello)
op: meow :) (fruggle)
cat(fruggle): you're *mine*
Overly attached cat. Pet it.
Gosh you don't get much privacy from ANYONE...time for a sheer curtain I'm thinking...
Your meow obviously meant "Help I'm being tortured, please save me."
You must have nailed that meow. If you walked by a cat and it said something to you in prefect English, however short, you would keep an eye on it too.
It's not so much what you said, it's how you said it.

I'd apologize and move out before accidents start happening.
You‚Äôd be pretty surprised too if you lived in a world filled with cats and then all of a sudden one cat, the one that happens to live next door spoke English at you
The face of concern though...
Someone finally spoke his language now they are trying desperately to communicate with you again.
Let him in!!!
Lookin through the glass like ‚ÄúI know what you fucking said‚Äù
he's looking for a friend!
Do you have a cat already? Might of sprayed all up your door :D
Plot twist : The cat is an undercover spy
The eyes are the cameras
Let him in asshole
That cute grin too, though
"Oh, here's a person tryna be cute meowing at me. Imma show him who's boss!"
What the hell did u say to him
What did you say about his momma.
You are the chosen one.
‚ÄúWe are brothers now‚Äù
You're his zoo now.
Awwww
[deleted]
Imagine if he had thumbs. You‚Äôd be fucked mate
This is my life now
LET ME IIIIINNN!!!
You have a Charley too! https://youtu.be/BOloEz3vmuc
You told him you needed help. He's there for you.
meow ‡∏Ö^‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢^‡∏Ö
I can almost hear the voice...‚Äùsoon...‚Äù.
That's unsettling. A simple chair in front of the window will do the trick
You should have checked the meaning of the Meow before your conversation with your neighbor‚Äôs cat.
let it in :(, please feed it. it's starving don't you know, honest
May be Unknowingly you said in cat language come visit us time to time
He's waiting for the nudes you said you were gonna send to  him.
He's sitting there like, "You take that back!"
Wtf dude. Why won't you let em in
I wonder if you accidentally meowed something insulting about its mother.
He is so cute and all you had to do was mowed ta him and he just comes over
Better than watching fish on the tv.
My dog used to bark in the garden and my neighbours would call the police.

Multiple neighbours cats would sin on the fence every day just staring at him. One point there was about 4 at the same time.

Cats wage psychological warfare.
I wonder what your meow translated to in cat language?
My wallet
Take him
Going to need regular photographic updates
Probably your cat you just need to let him in.
either you said something really touching or offensive. just let it in to see which one
Let him in! LET HIM IINNN!!!!!!
You obviously invited him and now you won't let him in? How rude.

Tldr. Don't say stuff in a language you don't understand.
Hate to tell you, but that ain't the look of a cat that JUST watches you live your life, that cat's plotting some Wile.E Coyote thingamajig...
*one of us* *one of us*
Is.. is that cat frowning?
Give that cat the pets it deserves!
r/petthedamncat
He wants to move in.  He thinks our diggs might be better.
I had a manager last year(he transferred) who had a habit of just meowing at you as he walked past as a casual hello.

One day, I beat him to it because he didn't see me coming. He kinda shouted "NO" back at me and I just laughed as I kept walking. That was a great day.
Let the poor thing in! Obviously he wants to move in.
Let him in. It's obviously your cat not, not your neighbors. Whatever you said you him must have convinced him you gave a better life. Congrats, you just acquired one (1) cat.
Hello! Is it me you're meowing for?! I can see it in your eyes!
