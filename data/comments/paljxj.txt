That monkey probably got vaccinated also.
“All the big-nakeds are doing this, I’ll try it..”
“Wtf? The bigs are stupid - you can’t even see with this on!”

Must be like when cats watch us showering. “Why would you let the rain INSIDE, and then purposely get IN it?!”
It's amazing really. He's trying to mimick the humans he sees wearing masks
If even wild animals know how then people who wear masks on their chin have no excuse
It's sad that people left contaminated masks on the ground so that a monkey could pick it up and breathe in all their germs. Some people are just disgusting.
I always imagine monkeys are thinking "Yes! I found a human thing. If I put this on it will make me just like a human." They try it out for a bit.  Then "humans must just be really stupid."
Smarter then the politicians here in florida
Hurr durr look at me, i'm a human hurr durr

I was going to make some joke about the monkey being smarter than some of my relatives, but then I got sad
Man I wish I had more exotic wild life than the occasional squirrel.

Still wearing it better than most Texans

Should put this video up in public places where people refuse to wear their masks properly. If a monkey can do it without being taught then humans should have no excuse.
And that kids is how another variant begins.
Monkeys are smarter than 99% of the antivax population in Alabama

New campaign, a monkey can do it, why can't you?
He follows rules better than ppl damn
The monkeys are having a laugh at us! C'mon man get vaccinated!
Can we teach Republicans to do this?
This is why the vaccines aren’t going to help stop Covid. The virus can jump from animal to human and back. So as soon as they find a vaccine for one strain, it can jump to a monkey, mutate, and then pop back up as, say, the Delta variant. This process will continue indefinitely. So if you are a vaxxer, get ready to have one every year (or more often, as the new booster is demonstrating). And while it may make you FEEL safer, you aren’t. The best thing anyone can do is to take care of your immunity. Research the natural foods and supplements that can help turbo charge your immune system. That’s how you fight this virus. Not by giving away your power to Big Pharma, who has not once, ever, been on your side.
Monkey Gets Corona First time
That's what you turn into when you get vaccinated! /s. Seriously people, go get vaccinated.

Bruh even monkeys have more brains than some humans

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er8rftr3LSQ&ab\_channel=RichardMarion

Monkey see, monkey do. Guess the general anti mask community are dumber than monkeys.
Dam he smarter than a lot of people I know

Well, at least we know now where the majority of amuricans are on the evolutionary ladder. Good job monkey! You’re smarter than 50% of my country 🤣👍
At least he covers the nose.
Monkey is smarter than a lot of people
So, we don’t have to compel fucking MONKEYS to wear a mask, but we can’t get conservatives to do it to save their friends and family? This world is nuts.
Come on guys even a freaking monkey is wearing one
Trying to understand how this gets awarded???
I get it’s sort of cute but for all the unwarranted fear i’ve seen all year and ongoing. 
2 points i wanna make.
point 1: if the virus was real it would be a great way to pass it along to others. 
virus is really over hyped fear mongering!

point 2: in a hospital face covering are deemed biohazard waste since they do become a petri dish of bacteria once worn.
This simply adds more trash not to mention by definition bio hazard waste to our streets.

Use a damn trash can because it’s the right thing to do regardless of pov.
To me it’s just trash but i had to make the definitive point to argue the hyperbolic news.
even monkeys are smarter than some humans smh
Monkey see, monkey do, then monkey not see.

If an untrained monkey can do it, what’s that say about the GOP?
Great now even the other primates are doing it better than us.
Republican inspection of alleged “communist indoctrination tool” circa March. 17, 2020 (colorized)
