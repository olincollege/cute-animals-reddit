Fun Facts: [Squirrels were considered the #1 pet in America, in the 18th century.](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pet-squirrel-craze)
"Ew there's hair on it!" 
- Squirrel 
[In reverse, it looks like the Squirrel is scavenging for food in her hair.](http://i.imgur.com/n3DrK6x.gifv)
I imagine this girl taking a nap on the couch and then later going to brush her hair and being a little confused when candies start falling out.
It's all fun and games until he gets his paws on a bowl of soup.
My buddy and I fed a young squirrel some corn nuts (ranch flavor I guess really builds that friendship) when we where kids. It followed us back to his house about a half mile away and we named him "tweak"; when he ran his front legs went way higher than needed and he looked like he was tweaking out trying to catch up with us, He wouldn't let us get more than about 30 feet away before scampering up to our legs and what seemed to be "dancing" for more food.
 He stayed with us for a few weeks and was a pretty good "pet", it was friendly and curious, until one day he decided to part ways and went off to be his own dude. 
I think as younger squirrels they are more dependent on social structures to survive (species did not seem to dictate what social structure works for this particular squirrel) and as they move towards adolescents they become more independent and that's where the domestication becomes an issue, all tho he never bit anyone or caused any issues. This is just my experience with pet squirrels as I am no squirrel master or someone who studies squirrel behavior beyond our summer friendship.

We've got a squirrel doing cute things and a pretty girl, I'm going to just ride this one to the front page

Wow. A girl can show 40% of her face and STILL get creepy comments about it!

I had a pet squirrel. He was fucking awesome. When he died I had him tattooed on my leg. Hot tip: Don't get tattoos in times of grief.

Im really curious where pet squirrels poop? Like do you just have to go through life picking up squirrel poop? 
Wonder how many live in there.
And you can put your weed in there..
Wtf is that squirrel doing inside?!

-A Dog
I work on a giant college campus. We have a ton of fat squirrels. They have learned to look cute and follow people who are eating.  Once I was sitting outside (first mistake) enjoying some sunflower seeds. (second mistake).  All of a sudden a giant squirrel jumped in my lap and went for the seeds in my hand. He ended up biting my finger through the nail. 

I threw him pretty far and he squealed like a cartoon.   I also learned they really don't carry rabies...good for me. 

 
So this is what Cosima does on her spare time.
My dog's reaction to this 

http://i.imgur.com/yfnraEP.jpg
So when he comes back for it does he just keep digging and clawing away until he finds it… or gets to the other side?
The squirrel or the insanely sexy eye and eyebrow under those glasses; can't decide which is cuter.

Beautiful Girls and Fantastic Squirrels 
Alright I know it sounds crazy and irrational, but I'm deathly afraid of squirrels. I've heard the chance of them having rabies is basically slim to none but still they get to close for comfort and freak me out. Shit I'm not even afraid of spiders I've just seen too many squirrel bite videos online. Can anyone confirm the likelihood of rabies in squirrels?
I also prepare for winter by hiding my cheetos.
Is this a pet squirrel?
She seems way too calm about this. 
Also, what do squirrels even eat?
Aww, packing lunch for mom.
Those dreads must have had a real earthy smell to them.
We are just walking trees
That's a cute cat 
Is that Alloy Ash?
My husband and I recently aquired a pet squirrel. Outside cat found her, niece rescued her and I syringe feed her. Tried to find a Rehaber to release her but never made contact so..... Had I realized she was staying I'd have handled her more now I'm making up for lost time. She has a large cage inside and get several hours a day to roam. She is great fun, but she scratches a lot and sometimes bites, so think carefully before making what may be a decade or longer commitment.
Cute but fucked up to give a squirrel a Cheeto.
Insanely cute. Have always been fascinated by them. 
http://i.imgur.com/AVRiy0Z.jpg 
Awwwwww so freaking adorably cute! 
Girl has squirrel. Squirrel has Cheeto. 

Life complete. 
Wow that's actually pretty big. You know those two have been together a long time to build up that kind of trust. Usually it takes 3-4years of training and trust building to get a woman to let you store food in her hair like that.  
Do you want ants? Because that's how you get ants.
How'd you domesticated a squirrel is what I want to know 
This brings a new meaning to the term, "your hairs a rats nest"
I want a squirrel. :(
So, on the way to work this morning, the car in front of me ran over a squirrel, but didn't kill the poor guy right away. Ran over its back legs and possibly lower spine, he was just flip flapping over the road and clearly distressed. 

So I stopped my car and ran over to it. Scooped it up with the idea of taking it to my local vets. (My girlfriend​ is a trainee nurse there, and does lots of stuff with local rspca, so if they can do something they will)

 Poor little guy was gulping for air, so I knew it wasn't good. So I sat in my car at the side of the ride for a while and just stayed with him and talked to him softly for a minute or two until he passed away. 

This all happened just outside of a local park, which is probably where he was headed to or from, so I scooped him back up and found a nice quite part, and placed him at the foot of a nicely shaded tree.

I know that I might have made things worse, by picking him up, but he would have been in the road on his own, and most likely finished off by the next car, and I didn't want the poor thing to be left on its own, I just hope I didn't distress it anymore that it was already. 

Anyhow, I just needed to let this out, and your post reminded me that squirrels are awesome. And I hope my little brief squirrel friend had a happy life like this guy. 

Thanks.
Well that's just nuts

Why do I feel ppl who have pet squirrels have dirty homes?
Don't buy it. Nobody saves Cheetos.
I recently had a squirrel dig up my herb garden to "save" some food for later. When I pulled it out, it was a whole goddamned chicken finger!
And that is how Cheeto trees are planted in the wild!
My friends dad had a pet squirrel for a bit, until one day he attacked. Ended up with a bunch of cuts on his face.
Watch out, if he forgets where it was you'll have a cheeto tree growing out of your head.
Cosima? is the rodent part of clone club?
The [smart lady](https://youtu.be/LwXF6itJn1o?t=14) bought a squirrel. 
How many cheetos can I hide in this head grass?? 
the little hand pats so cute
Hey this post isn't locked yet! Good job, Reddit!
OP Is that your squirrel? I have so many questions. 
Where can I obtain a domesticated squirrel for being my pet?! Such want. 
I had a pet squirrel that lived in my room a few years ago. I know just how the hiding food routine goes... One time I was sitting on my floor playing with her and she decided to hide a nut in the rim of my pants. I naturally took it out and sat it back on the floor, and this little squirrel picked it up again, and put it right back in my pants. 
Squirrels are very interesting pets.
Omg i need a pet squirrel,  they are so damn cute!
That's how most Cheeto trees are planted
Hair today, gone tomorrow
Squirrel girl got cheese in her curls
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH WILD ANIMAL PETS??
Some say the Cheeto is still there to this day. And if you listen on a dark and stormy night, you can hear it howling through the dreadlock forest. "Call me now," it cries. "Call me now, for a free readin..." 
your cat looks abnormal
Haha! Sarah Silverman's new show has some great stuff about squirrels..apparently, they can't find 80% of the acorns they hide..hence..TREES!
We had a foster squirrel similar to that. Raised it from a little nugget that needed syringe feeding every two hours, including in middle of the night. Brought her to work in a pet taxi for her feedings. As she got bigger we'd let her run around like in the gif, eventually built a huge outdoor cage with lots of obstacles to parkour on, it was to keep her safe while she got comfortable being outside. Finally, let her loose, and she lived in the tree right out front. She'd come down and say hi, we'd feed her cashews.  Then, one morning she got hit by a car, and that was it. 

I wish there was a happy ending. We live on a slow street, but people still apparently drive too fast. Enjoy your squirrel, they're awesome little friends. 

RIP Peanut. Wildlife fostering can be heart wrenching, but it's worth it.
I wish I had that squirrel, it's so cute.
I'm just gonna put this right hair
I remember hiding my gum in my sister's hair.
TIL Cosima from Orphan Black has a pet squirrel.  
You look like Alex Vause from Orange is the New Black 
I like how shes totally unfazed. Like this is a common, everyday occurrence. Damn well I'd allow my pet squirrel to hide cheetoes in my weave too! Dedicated parent right there. Unless that squirrel just randomly broke into your house to hide cheetoes in your hair then dipped out promptly. If so, I'd file a police report and go no contact OP. Just let the abuser know and threaten to call the cops. He should leave you alone and find a new place to hide its cheetoes.

Fun Fact: In Chinese squirrels are called "tree rats". Once I owned a home I can now agree with that sentiment. 
that girl isn't smiling at all, this is a normal thing to her
I like her hair. 
I'd like to hide a nut in the back of her head too tho.
Am I the only person that think people with dreads smell bad?

Girls with hair like this have a 100% to steal your nut.
I once fed a handful of squirrels cheese balls at the National Mall in DC. They immediately came after me once I opened the bag. 
My girlfriend once found a lollipop stick in her hair when showering after spending a couple of days revising for exams.

She didn't own a squirrel.
PUFFY Cheeto??? PUFFY???

Tell the squirrel to bury the damn insult to snacking comestibles in the backyard and never speak of it again. 

Then go buy the poor thing a bag of CRUNCHY Cheetos. And apologize to the squirrel. 

And none of these terrible new flavors of  CRUNCHY Cheetos. 

http://www.fritolay.com/snacks/product-page/cheetos

Sorry I flared.
This girl's lack of reaction gives me the impression this is just another day in the life of owning a squirrel to her.
I cannot believe on what i just saw. Awesome.
Does anyone have the source of the gif?
This is cute! I want rodents to put their food in my hair!
he's trying to unmatte your nappy ass dreads
I would hate to see where he hides his nuts...

I never laughed so hard. This is adorable and funny. 

Good thing you weren't asleep when this was happening. 
How long until the comments section gets locked because of sexual harassment?
I love your hair! Apparently so do squirls...
The squirrel wasn't hiding it... he was feeding it to the tentacle monster on her head.

Just here to comment before the thread gets locked.
This cheeto is never going to be found again. Just like the pancakes stuck behind the kitchen counters.
Expected something Trump-related. Was pleasantly surprised.
I love the resigned look on her face. "Every day with this shit. Every. Day."
And the next spring, a Cheeto Tree sprouted, pushing it's way towards sun. Soon it will give Cheetos to that squirrel's great -grandchildern, and the cycle begins again.

As a one time squirrel owner I can say for certain you will regret having a squirrel.
r/upvotedbecausesquirrel^SomebodyAlreadyMadeThisJoke,Whoops
There's a squirrel in your house you idiots.

Can you buy pet squirrels or is this a rescue?
My dog hides things for later consumption around the house; bones, raw hide, dog biscuits, etc. I'm really glad she hasn't reached this level yet!
She is a good sport, lots of people don't like having cheetos in their hair.
Okay now I want a pet squirrel
Are squirrels pets now?
Well did he come back for it?
I always find it weird when I see what are perfectly common, brown squirrels, because of the squirrels around here are black.
Sometimes you gotta squirrel it away for a rainy day.
Best part is she's not surprised this is happening at all.
That's where i put my cheetos? So i can relate
Sad when you get so old, you can't find your nuts anymore. 
Ahh, that'll see him through the winter
MARVEL Squirrel Girl sneak peek looks great!

Do they remember later  where they put there things? 
Squirrels can't find 80% of Cheetos they hide. 
That squirrel is going to pissed when she stands up
Imma gonna start doing this to my wife.
Hairy Cheetos. Best Cheetos.
SHE'LL NEVER SUSPECT A THING
Cheeto so good had to save that shit for later. 
"DONT GO ANYWHERE HOOMAN"
Squirrels are so little and dumb. 
how does one get a pet squirrel? 

How much you want to bet they both forget about it and a few weeks later, there is a cheetos tree growing out of her head.
I figured this would be another Trump related post and after I clicked I was pleasantly surprised.
So this is how squirrel girl really got her power! Guess op is squirrel girl now.
Day made. And it's early and I have sink valves to replace and that's going to suck. But I'm going to be giggling thinking about this.
This raises too many questions.
We have a squirrel that comes to our patio door for nuts. He comes REALLY close to the door and even opened his mouth one time to get a nut from my fingers. It scared the hell out of me! 
wait you can get a pet squirrel? 
 A pet............squirrel?
I miss my pet squirrel...

I want a damn squirrel 
How can you put a cheeto in your mouth and not eat it?
You look like Cosima from Orphna Black
And consume before it turns into Shampoo taste
Do pet stores sell squirrels? Are these pets usually found in wild instead? How are people usually getting them? Is it even allowed? 
It took a while for me to register that this was a squirrel and then I was like...WHAT?!
When I first read your headline, I thought you were talking about Trump. Then I realized I was in /r/aww
Where did the cheeto go?? WHERE'S MY CHEETO!?!?
i'm just a squirrel tryna getta cheeto so wassup girl

The hair refluffing is killing me!!!
She is his safe place!
Wook
I've seen a sqirrel carrying a baby squirrel head first in its mouth.  I can't unsee it 8 years later.
That's awesome!
I have tons of squirrels in my yard that act close to tame. I looked out on the patio yesterday and saw the cat, the dog, and a squirrel just hanging out together. Stupid dog. You're supposed to chase squirrels, not snuggle with them. 
I wonder if it will drill through OPs head at night looking for it's loot.

Is that her pet squirrel? That's awesome
I'd love a pet squirrel but I have 3 cats, and a small dog who thinks he's tough (admittedly he'd likely run away from the squirrel).
So did you find it?
OMG I would be sooo happy to have a little buddy like this little guy 😄 
Where I live there are no squirrels, I'd love to seen one personally.
Honestly I wonder why not many people keep squirrels.

Because most pet rodents (notable examples being chinchillas, all three *Phodopus* dwarf hamster species, and gerbils) aren't domesticated, either. 
My dog does something similar with her bones. 
An oddly soothing video
It's amazing she was able to train the squirrel to stash it for her. That's a whole lot of work to avoid hiding it in your hair yourself.
Squirrels.... not even once...
That's unnatural. I suspect lycanthropy. 
Humans have labored for thousands of years to distance themselves from animals.  Now we happily invite them in.  
That reminds me, back in highschool some guy during the lunch period threw a bunch if Cheetos/fries in my hoodie. I didn't notice until next class, threw my hoodie over my head mid class and everyone started laughing. My teacher said it was disgusting that I had fries in my hoodie. Good times!!!
My Dad's squirrel loves Cheetos!  No joke.
As a curly haired guy with lots of hair that is terrified of rodents, this makes me anxious on a whole other level I had never experienced before.
When I had my squirrel Chewy, he would hide crackers in the couch cushions all the time. It was so cute watching him trying to cover it up. 
Ok cool, but how do get a pet squirrel?
That's my nightmare right there
First it was raccoons, now squirrels, god damn I want a crazy pet.
I love how she doesn't seem to react at all while he's digging in her hair like this is a very regular occurance.
I expect some hate for this as I'm posting on a squirrel loving thread. Admitting that squirrels can be cute on occasion, I put out bird seed in the Winter and the darn squirrels eat most of it.  Couldn't imagine keeping the hyper little rodents as a house pet.    Fortunately a pair of owls sequestered my property as part of their territory and no more squirrel problem.    
[removed]
why do you own a squirrel 
Recently acquired one. She is great fun, but she scratches a lot and sometimes bites. She has a large indoor cage and get several hours a day to roam. She will chew on anything and try to eat it if she can ( try taking a pen away from an angry squirrel). She is fed rodent food and fresh veggies daily and a few nuts. It is work, think carefully before making a possible decade or longer commitment.
Didn't this girl/squirrel combo post another where they were singing or something?
That's where I hide my extra cheetos
Is that a pet squirrel?
Cheetos can not be healthy for squirrels.
That squirrel has better self-discipline than I do  
If you give a squirrel a cheeto
What is the bush thinks the squirrel. Time to hide food for hibernation. 
r/UpvotedBecauseSquirrel
I knew someone with a pet squirrel, bit his ear off 
this is currently a metaphor for our state of affairs. 
Another fun fact: Squirrels don't often remember where they hid their food, aiding to the spread of plants and tree seeds. 
How does one get a pet squirrel? Like was it caught in the wild? 
Kinda should be expected when you try to domesticate wild animals...
That's the most unimpressed human I've seen for a while.
I like how the squirrel buries the cheeto in the lady's hair.  
You better keep that cheeto there for later lol
serious question, can squirrels be domesticated?
I want all four of those things.
back when I had my squirrel, rocky he would do the same with my mothers hair. 
I love squirrels

There. No one will ever find it....
Is that how dreads are made? 
Lolol I love this
No way that's the only Cheeto in there.
I imagine she regularly wakes up with food in her hair.
So that's how you make dreadlocks...
So THATS where dreadlocks come from. TIL
A wook would have a squirrel as a pet 
I wonder else is hid in that hair? 🤔
This can't have been the first it stuck in there. What number was it?
Squirrels belong outside and to live in the wild. It just benefits every single thing. Challenge me with any suggestion preferring the opposite. I dare you.
familiar 
This is kinda cute, but my app sent me two notifications for this. I don't even lurk or post in this sub. Weird.
I see a squirrel, I **like** !
She needs a dog to hide that squirrel for future consumption 
Fuck the haters, cool pet. 
HOW DID YOU DOMESTICATE A SQUIRREL???
he's gonna be pissed when he comes back for that cheeto and doesn't find it

We have way too many squirrels in the U.S.

Squirrels are too precious for this world 
Don't blame him- cheetos have to be hidden from greedy fingers.

That thing is better groomed than I am. It's so fucking cute, I've always wanted a squirrel because something about how small and fuzzy and hyper they are makes them so much cuter than any other pet. A ferret just wouldn't compare
Me and my mom saved a baby squirrel one time. We don't have him anymore, we sold him to a lady who had their squirrels for him to play with. I definitely understand the struggle of pulling the most random objects out of your hair! My squirrel (squirrlington) would always shove stuff into our couch, hair, Shirts, you name it
Dude, there's a squirrel in your house. You might want to fix that.
My rat used to that to me!!! 
That girl is remarkably chill about the whole thing
Doesn't seems very hygienic. 
Okay how do you get a squirrel as a pet? Asking for a friend.
As she is recording this i assume this is not the first time and she has a whole packing in there.
Jesus the self control to have a Cheeto in your mouth but not eat it...

OK I gotta ask, what kind of dumb ass animal hides their food in another animal that's just gonna walk away, or remove it. I'd think that their survival instincts would tell them that's not a good hiding spot.
OMG grill
I'd play hide the cheeto with her too. 
Wait.. I've been wanting a squirrel for years. How can I domesticate one within the next week?

I used to have a pet flying squirrel when I was about five! Was a pretty sweet little guy, he loved loved LOVED Reese's Cocoa Puffs. Whenever he was out of the cage, he'd always go straight to my older sister's left shoulder (always the left) and pee, even if he had already peed. He was a cool guy to watch just hang around the cage.
Pet squirrels are the best. Until they suddenly go batshit. It always happens, they're a great pet. Then wild and nuts. No pun intended.
I don't think I stand alone when I admit I watched it multiple times expecting to see more of OP's face.
Animals like that should be allowed to be free in the wild
I don't think all these likes are for the squirrel.
lol

We have a Southern flying squirrel named [Rico](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/5dqddu/rough_life_for_this_little_flying_squirrel/?st=J3G7EN3U&sh=f4f6c26e), and he does this same thing nightly. It still makes me laugh every time he does it- along with lots of other squirrelly shit they do! 
I want to eat that cheeto. 

I'd hide my nut in her.
Don't all dreads have cheetos in them??
Did that squirrel just nut in her hair?
so cuit
There are probably other cheetos in there, from other squirrels.

Hot girls have pet squirrels?  Haha Bob Ross has started a movement!

Is it just me, or does that look like Tatiana Maslany.

What else is hidden in that hair to be found and eaten for later?  Nothing like a little hair with your food.
So that's why girls bump their hair
Stuff some in her pocket for seeecret eaaaating.
Why do squirrels bother hiding food...? Won't the other squirrels be able to smell that shit just as easily as the ones who hid it?
Preparing stores of food for the harsh winter.
My mom always said this would happen to me if I didn't wash my hair
It appears that the squirrel has hidden something in her hair before.
This is how cheeto trees are planted 
Does he do this because her hair smells like dirt?
i took care of an orphaned baby squirrel for a couple of years, theyre really awesome animals 
Would keeping a bin o' dirt in your pad kill you? 
How do you get a pet squirrel?
:3
Man, squirrels are flat out awesome little creatures. Kind of wish I had a pet one but I can't imagine the nightmare of finding squirrel poop hidden in every dark corner of my apartment.
It probably improved the smell of the dreads tbh.
Damnit! How did snuggles escape from my anus!!?? AGAIN!!
Love the way he fluffs up the hair at the end. 
Step one.
I'm in love with the way the squirrel rearranges the hair 
Now I want to see a gif of him coming back for it later.
Just started watching duck dynasty and I believe they eat fried squirrels and squirrel brains. nice.
Smoking hot squirrel lover here
Internet over. 
Why always girls (cute girls...okie sometimes hot) vs pets?
My cat is convinced that my hair is actually a beaver on top of my head. Or so I thought. Maybe she's seen this video and is searching for that cheeto...
silly squirrel cheetos are best eaten fresh!
Upvoted because squirrel.
Wild animals in the house. What could go wrong?
That's exactly what that hair is for..  Ugh
Aw man, this makes me miss my pet red squirrell Rocky. If you cupped your hand he would always try to hide his food in it. He was the coolest
Why didn't i tink of that
I wonder how hard domestication of squirrels would be, and what they'd look like after.
that squirrel is going to be so disappointed come winter
Germaine's gonna be pissed when she finds out where Foamy's been hidin' the Cheetos. . .
You gonna eat that?
Cute but why tho thats gross
The girl remind me so much of Cosima of the serie Orphan Black !
I wouldn't mind burying my cheeto in her.
how did u get a pet squirrel???
I love how he's like "yup, that'll do" 
80% of nuts hidden by squirrels are not found. 
Fucking halarious

That girl is lucky
I'd play hide the Cheeto with her any day. 
I hate to be a debbie downer, but it's a fact that squirrels can transmit Bubonic Plague. Usually from fleas. Cute little critters, though. 
That's awesome!
Marry me
Squirrels can only find 20% of the cheetos they hide 
Ahahahahaha
How many more Cheetos are hiding there?
I wonder why squirls arnt pupillar pets, they've alwayse reminded me as the cat of the rodent family
My mom was a vet, and when I was young we took care of and then later released a bunch of baby squirrels. The nest was in a tree that some landscapers had to remove on our lawn and they told my mom about it. So I had squirrels for a while. They were awesome little animals. Impossible to keep in a cage because they use those little hands to fuck with everything until they get out. Super nice and smart too. They would come around after we released them and I would give them nuts every so often.
Anyone else reminded of Cristolph Waltz's speech in 'Inglourious Basterds'?

I doubt she'd let a rat do the same thing to her.
You should have bought a squirrel
Let's appreciate op's amazing skin and mini eye roll haha
80% likely this Cheeto will be forgotten.

Thanks for teaching me that Sarah Silverman
lol
Worst hair salon, ever!
I'd put a cheeto in her... 
Is that Tatiana Maslany?
