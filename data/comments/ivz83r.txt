Whaaaaaat 21 years old... your cat can officially drink now in USA lol! What a beautiful darling!
He‚Äôs gorgeous! Our little old lady cat was with me before my kids, slept on them when they were bumps, loved them like her own kittens  and always gave them love, purrs and headbutts. She passed in June, my kids were 14 & 13, she was 17, just missed out on being able to vote. Lovely girl and very missed by us all. So pleased you‚Äôve still got your boy.
"Stay with someone who looks at you like that.." ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Will never forget when I worked at a clinic a 24yo dog came in to be put down. He was blind and deaf but otherwise healthy until he got cancer roughly 2 months earlier. The family was a mother in her early 40s, her daughter who was 22 and her husband, and their baby. Here is a grown woman married with a child who had never known life without this dog. It was incredible

Brought a tear to my eye as my lil guy passed away this past December before my birthday. He too was my companion.

Lost my 17 year old kitty this week.  So much love for the old souls :)
Thats amazing. I had to let my cat of 18 years be put down at the vet last week because of kidney failure. Hope he still acompanies you for a long time.
Relationships like this are absolutely amazing, I had a cat that was with me from birth all the way to my sphomore year in highschool but unfortunately he just couldn't go any longer, but he will always be with me! 
RIP Flip
Beautiful cat, and story... I loved it!
He looks like an proud angel close to the end of his life knowing he did a good job raising you!
Sweet kitty ‚ô•Ô∏è
Big hugs to you.
Awww.  My baby girl just turned 15 today!  I hope she is with me as long as your sweet one has been with you.  Thanks for sharing.
With those eyes, he looks like he can see the future.

I don't know why but that though has be bawling my eyes out while my 17yo cat pesters me for cuddles.

She has claws. I sure that's where the tears come from. Has to be.
Awwww soooo handsome üòç
Awe so much love for your kitty(: ü•∞ü•∞
Lost mine at 21 last year. Broke down about it last night again. Still can't believe it. The cat was the sweetest fucking girl.
Some people just don't understand the cat bond. Had to let go of my little man this year. It still hurts. I'm happy you guys have gotten to spend so much time together. And wishing you the best for more! He's precious.
My cat died at 15 years old. At the time my wife was pregnant with our daughter. I really really wanted him to meet her. He was a great cat. Never cried as hard as the day we had to say goodbye. Still miss him a few years later. Really wish my daughter could have met him. I think they would have loved each other.
Those eyes <3
üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è
I 100% understand that lifetime bond, I was present for my cats birth at 15. He picked me before he could open his eyes, and he moved with me in every life stage - travel, college, roommates, marriage. He was my best road trip buddy. He passed at 18 years of age, but we very much grew up together. He was there for all of it.

I promise you, the importance of being your companion through your transitions is not lost on your old baby. The depth of that relationship is forever unique to both of you. I‚Äôm so glad you can savor every moment. Sending you both my love.
He‚Äôs such a beautiful boi
What a beautiful cat friend you have there
Please do a pawprint and memorybook. Might sound cheesy, but you will appreciate it.
Those are some soulful eyes.
What do you feed your cat?! I want my good boy, Bobby, to be around as long as possible!
Wow. I love seen other people‚Äôs cats that have made it to their 20s. I have a 21 year old cat too!
He‚Äôs gorgeous, make sure you get him a check up routinely. Senior cats can have complications, I just lost my baby at 17 yesterday :( take care of him and continue giving him a long healthy and happy life. ‚ù§Ô∏è
My baby, Maggie, accompanied me through the worst years of my life. She was 18 when she died. She made sure to be there for me through my suicide attempts and waited until I was stable enough to make it through life on my own. I hope your baby made you as happy as mine did
I love him too ‚ù§

I've got a kitty named Binx that I got just before starting 10th grade. He's my baby boy. Now I'm almost 29 and getting married next summer. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ I hope I've got several more years with my Binx that I can treasure just like you and your kitty!!
I lost my 23 year old boy on January 31st. I got him shortly after meeting my husband. I had him through having my husband deployed, moving across country, having a baby, and raising that baby into adulthood. 

I am actually happy that he told me that it was time when he did. We were able to have the vet right out to the house. He crossed the bridge in my arms, in my bed, surrounded by people who love him. It was very peaceful for him.
So sorry, I just put my cat to sleep today he was 17. Max
Good boi
Family.
He looks like a fox ü¶ä ‚ù§Ô∏è
The way kitty is  looking at you says bunches...
My cat is 22. Hail old kitties!
Such a beautiful old boy!
This is the definition of a good boy. He is absolutely the sweetest, happy birthday to him!
I had a cat from when I was 6 weeks old until I was 21 we had to put her down a few a few years back but she was such a sweet baby
We should all aspire to be that important to the beings around us. 

What a beautiful picture.
A Russian Blue? I had a Russian Blue who died a couple years ago. Loved that boy... as you said... with all my heart.

So sorry for your loss. Great picture... feel like you can see his soul in this one.

Congratulations on your baby... 4 months old!
This is so emotional. I can‚Äôt... I am so happy for you guys! More years to come!
Mine was 24 when he died. Lived through my childhood, teen years, got married, and got divorced.
Wow his eyes are *amazing!* Congrats on your big day buddy!

Mine just turned 4! I'll love her for forever. Honestly the best, most non-asshole cat I've ever had.
What a beautiful wee soul! My cat lived to 22 and was the best companion through puberty and uni and heartbreak
Happy 21st Birthday!! You look great.
What a handsome boy with the most beautiful eyes!! Such a beautiful story, it made me tear up :‚Äô)
21 years is a WONDERFUL run. What a beauty.
Your cat is 100 years old in cat years. A centenarian. A hundred years of happiness and bliss taking care of his favorite human.

A century of loving you and being loved in return. 

A full life, indeed.
Total envy my dude, I wish my dog had lived that much. Your cat looks totally awesome.
What a strong little buddy. Here‚Äôs to more years!
He‚Äôs got big beautiful eyes and a big beautiful heart that‚Äôs ready for you

This post reaffirms my belief that humanity is good
What a beauty.
That's one gorgeous kitty right there.
You've taken good care of him. My wife of 20 years passed away 3 years ago. Our cat of 20 years passed away 6 months after she did. Was a rough year.
Aww! Omg Hi buddy!
Give your sweet kitty a pet for me.
He looks like he's going to impart some deep wisdom to me... which I could use, to be honest.

I'm sorry for your loss.

(Edit - I‚Äôm an idiot.  Kitty is alive and awesome.)
He‚Äôs a handsome kitty!
What a handsome boy !

That's awesome. The moment his health starts to decline, don't let him suffer!
I feel the need to cry and hug/pet him...
Awesome.
What‚Äôs the beautiful‚Äôs name?
He looks like a [Slow Loris](https://animals.sandiegozoo.org/sites/default/files/2019-06/pygmy-slow-loris.jpg) with those eyes üíï
Such character in that face.
Beautiful boy! I'll glad he has been able to grow up with you - friends like that are hard to come by ;)

I didn‚Äôt think mine would make it to see my baby - now my son is old enough to know my cat‚Äôs name and find him when I ask where he is!
Absolutely beautiful!!!!!
Amazing. U must take really good care of him. Great job and happy birthday and congratulations!!
Aw such a beautiful cat, he might as well have doxed you with those eyes
Aww, what a sweet, beautiful boy! This almost brought a tear to my eye thinking about our cat, he passed away a few weeks ago at 16 years old. I was so convinced that he would make it to 20+.
My geezer is 18, she's still howling like a banshee and ruling the house. I'm trying to keep her as comfortable as possible.
I just LOVE these old kittens ‚ù§Ô∏è That look, that fur, so cute ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Beautiful creature. Kisses.
He is beautiful. We have to put out 14 year old snowshoe down within the next week and I was thinking 14 was a long time. 22 is unreal!!
This is Caturday‚Äôs finest hour
That is one cool cat.
i legit thought this was a raccoon at first glance
Nice puss puss!
Handsome old chap! üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüòç

Looks very sweet too! I like his eyes.
Love this baby as much as you can. I just lost mine at 13 and I miss her every day.
What a handsome boy...you are both so lucky.   ‚ô•Ô∏è
Nice üëçüèø
God bless you ‚ù£Ô∏è
Sweet wise boy!
Man this pure, so pure.
What a gift to have a beloved pet for so long and through so many milestones.
That boy deserves all the love!!!!
Freaking adorable. Give him all the scritches!
If this cat could talk.  That look on its face just says "Ive seen some shit in my lifetime"
Take my free Wholesome award.
A cat that's older than me, wow!

Given that the average lifespan of a cat is [15.1 years](https://www.catster.com/cat-health-care/how-long-do-cats-live-cat-health-facts) and the average human's life is [around 81](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181002-how-long-did-ancient-people-live-life-span-versus-longevity), we can assume that every year for humans is like 5.36 for cats. Therefore, you cat is 112 years old! Congratulations!
I thought he had a bionic eye.
Still has baby eyes üíï
I hope my boy lives this long with no troubles. Hes currently 16, did your cat start getting thin around that time? Mine is and it's starting to worry me, hes eating like he always has but hes getting skinnier and skinnier and my vet is jam packed rn.
I had a 21 year old girl named Katie
:) thank you for making me smile
Aww the cat us so fucking adorable and my God 21 years old are you sure your not beating a world record for the world oldest cat???
What is his name? He is just beautiful!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Best friends forever!
He looks like our sweet grey kitty! Ours is 14 and blind with kidney problems but still a sweetie boy
Lo I usher thee beyond this land. 
Rise past The lofty ash and pine
 far from what we understand
A berry picked too soon from vine
dwell not Upon this mortal plane
 your soul is hence released
this short Life lived was not in vain
may you find eternal peace
You are very lucky to have those years with him.  A good, old kiki.  ‚ù§
My Sidney died just before she turned 21. I found her and her sister abandoned in a ditch... so young their eyes were only half open... a few hundred yards from the local humane society. I‚Äôm so glad you had each other. My condolences.
I have a 17 year old lilac point named Livia, after Caesar Augustus's wife. Siamese are the best. ‚ù§
My girl is about 15 and has seen some shit....sex, drugs, an arrest with jail time for us both, and now her little brother. Kiah....you're the best Catermelons there ever was and probably will ever be for me so here's to OPs friend and mine.üçª
My kitty was 15 when he passed. Was my best friend. Chester Drysacks.
Cats rule.
My dear Lester made it to 20 years old. He was so special, he was almost human. He was every bit a member of my family as anyone. Nod your head to him and he nodded back. Call him over and he came and spent time with you.  He was a gift from heaven. He‚Äôs been gone a long time now but I hold him in my heart as much now as I did when he was a kitten. I lost my mom, I am hopeful he greeted her on the other side.
 Those eyes!
You're super lucky. I wish my dog boomer had lived that long. She passed away this last may. May 5th to be exact, at least she went with a party! But she was part of my life for over 15.5 years. I got her when i was 13 years old. She was there for me when highschool was hard. She was there for me i got my first girlfriend, and subsequently first ex-girlfriend. She was there for me when my parents divorced. She was there when my grandparents died, and my aunt who died way to young, cancer at 60. She was there when i found out my mother had stage 3 breast cancer, she is on track to be a survivor so no worries there.

All the little things in my life i shared with her. She was and still is my best friend. And god damn if i dont miss her everyday she is gone. But i try not to dwell on her not being here and try to focus on what we had together. A friendship that no matter how shitty of a mood i was in she would come around and want some pets, or a belly rub and immediately wasnt in such a shitty mood.

[Dog Tax](https://imgur.com/Da7jCKD)
This was from 10 years ago when she was still only a pupper.
My heartttttt AHHHHHHH I love him
Old cats are the best!
What a lovely friendship.
Amazing. These little cat people are with us through SO much! It's great that you can appreciate it, and present a photo that captures the cat's awesomeness. Cheers to you both.
I am 21 years old and am in college. I adopted a fearful little kitten a year ago and all I want in the world is for him to be there for me like your boy has been there for you.
Beautiful kitty cat. Mine made it to 20 years old and just left me a couple of weeks ago. Such a treasure!!!!
My little Misty was given to me as a kitten when I was thirteen. Now she is nineteen and has seen me through most of those same milestones and is keeping my grandma company. She is skinny but otherwise seems happy and healthy.
I fucking love this
Such soulful eyes. He has seen a lot in 21 years and obviously been loved a lot.
Happy Birthday, beautiful cat.
That cat holds the universe in its eye.
What a handsome boy.  So glad you had all that time with him.  He will be waiting for you at the Rainbow Bridge üåà‚ù§Ô∏èüåà
I love him too ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
I also turned 21 yesterday. Happy birthday kitter!
I'm not crying, you're crying ‚ï•Ôπè‚ï• ‚ô°

You're so lucky to have had him for so long! You must take great care of him!
Love it my russian grey is 22 as well
I'm only 17. I never thought a cat would be older than me. For some reason I have a strange anology that most house hold pets pass away after 10-15 years.
Never forget that your pet is only part of your life, but you are part of all of his life.

Bless to all of you.
This kitty is part of the 1998 committee! Gang gang üíï
oh god my little shit head could live another 7 years??

jkjk. I‚Äôve had him since I was 10. He‚Äôs definitely been there to help me through a lot and I was very happy that I could have him with me for my last year of college. They really are the most underrated companions.

Oh my stars those eyes! üòç
How is he health wise? Happy birthday to him btw üòÅ
Wow what a great looking cat, did you give him his first beer yet üç∫
I wish this beautiful cat good health ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
What a handsome floof!!! Give some boops for me please!!
You should share on r/oldmandog
The sub that celebrates older pets.
Such a beautiful baby kitty üíï
what a beautiful cat. My cat has the same kind of spots in his eyes. Did you ever have a vet look at those? Not saying you need to but wondering what they said they are if you did.
Why didn't you let him meet your baby earlier?
Give him a little Brewers Yeast tablet.  It'll really shine up his gorgeous fur.
What‚Äôs the secret to his long life?
Que viejo lol cute cat
Precious!
I wish you many more happy years!
My friend's cat is almost 19 and completely looks it lol. I have never met such an old man cat in my life that also looks like he's still 5.
Nothing but love ‚ô° for ya kitty, stay strong, keep going
He‚Äôs a beauty!  ‚ù§Ô∏è
so beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
Beautiful cat
I read that as if you were 21 and was thinking shit you've had a full 21 years slow down a bit
Awwww he still looks like such a young kitten .. how cute , I'd never guess hes 21 years old ! Good job!!ü•∞‚ù§
That looks reminds me of a sleestak from land of the lost.
I‚Äôm already in a mood. You just took it over the top!!    Love ‚ù§Ô∏è your kitty!!
He still has baby eyes ü•∫
This is everything I hope for with my cat! ü§ûüèºI‚Äôve had cats growing up and pets my whole life but she was the first I‚Äôve adopted and the first cat that‚Äôs ‚Äúmine‚Äù and not a family pet. I adopted her when I worked at an animal shelter when I was 21 and she was 5. It was so wild to me adopting her as an adult knowing she may know my children someday. We‚Äôre 25 and 9 now, we‚Äôve been through moving out on our own to our first apartment, my chronic illness journey, my boyfriend‚Äôs 9 month deployment and so much more. I tell her she has to live until at least 20, I won‚Äôt stand for anything else! üòπ I regularly get emotional at the thought of knowing she won‚Äôt be around someday. I‚Äôm so very sorry for the loss of your sweet boy, what a journey you guys had together! He certainly had a very fulfilled life and I can tell was very loved, I know he can too ‚ù§Ô∏è
Those are some good fucking onions
21 is a longgg life for a kitty, unreal, I still have a very vivid memory of my life in 1999.
I love him so much omg
Your cat is older than me!! Happy Birthday kitty ü•≥üòä
Amazing eyes..beautiful
Pretty kitty you have.  I‚Äôve loved all my cats to pieces.  Now down to 1 kiitty - Lucy-Kitty.  Going strong at 15.
Oh my God, a cat as old as I am. So glad you still have him! What a king
So sweet üß°
Sweet senior ü•∞
He still has so much more Love to give.
Mine has gone on Last end of the July. She had 18 years old. I can still cry thing about her. I loved her, forever.
Happy birthday, hope these have been some very happy 21 years üíï
I wonder what that is in human years. Impressive
I love this old man
Looks just like my baby boy Mouser. He also made it to 20s
Hey very cute cat wish him meany more years to go , happy b day  to him  meow yeah all meow,
I‚Äôm right there with you. My best friend and confidant lived 21 years 7 months. I couldn‚Äôt have made it through many of those years without him.
Oh my goodness, he‚Äôs beautiful and looks just like my Simon!
Soooooo precious üíô
What do you feed him?
What a great companion to have on your journey through life. Beautiful. üíú
Amazing boi, girl, friend, equal.
He's a beauty. My childhood kitty made it to 13, and my brother's cat is going on 17. She's in poor health, though. She must be a happy girl when she has her wits about her; poor thing is otherwise a little senile. She's seen a lot, just like this guy. üòä
Hug him for me. Mine was there from age 11-30 for me. I‚Äôm 37 now and I still miss him everyday üíóüê±üíï
WOW ... if only he could talk... the stories he would have !!! such a handsome boy!! esp with those huge eyes !! please give him some hugs and pets from reddit !!!
Your boy is beautiful!
He has the best beautiful aged face! One of my kitties lived til 21. He looked like he was 85, loose old man wrinkly fur, eyes that could see forever. And I loved him. He was as old as my daughter at the time.
A true family member to say the least. You had a great little companion.
Handsome guy
Awh, I had to put down my 21 year old girl this year üò≠ it‚Äôs bittersweet to have them for so long!
What do you feed him?
I do too. He is clearly a very good boy.
what a handsome! And he looks great, full stop
That facial expression is one of trust and affection. You‚Äôre lucky to have a feline friend like that.
I didn‚Äôt plan on crying this early on a Saturday night, damn.
Mine finally died last year after 18 years.
Not gonna lie. That's kinda creepy.
21!  Wow... that outstrips the average by 6 years.  I put that down to quality care from a devoted owner/buddy.
Bravo!!!!   I totally understand ‚ù§Ô∏è
What a good baby! How lucky to have had so many wonderful years together.
good kitty bby bless his soul and health ‚ô•Ô∏è
This post is amazing üíì. Thank you for brightening my day :)
He was meant to be there!  So happy for you have a life long best bud!

I had my buddy Tiger for 20 years and a month, and we saw the world together. He lived with me in Europe, Korea, and all over the US of A.   


I'm thankful your friend is still with you. Give him a face rub for me, please.
Happy birthday to your cat!
This is what family means. They are family. You are wonderful, and so is he!

Now that is a venerable old soul.
My pair lasted 21 for the female and the male made it to 25! They where so great. Siblings Frick and Frack. How I miss them.
He‚Äôs a beautiful little man
He is so handsome! Thank you for sharing his picture and story with us! You definitely are an amazing parent! He doesn‚Äôt look 21 at all! He is very very loved and we can clearly see that.

I‚Äôm tearing up in a mixture of happiness in seeing this beautiful boy at 21 but also in sadness. I lost my 19-year old girl last year. She was with me through my whole childhood, teenage years and early adulthood. The best companion I‚Äôve ever had, I miss her everyday.
Omg tell him happy birthday and give him snuggles for me!!! ü•∫ü•∞ what's his name?
How tf can cats live this long? This is incredible.
WOW omg those eyes üòÑ
So wonderful that you‚Äôve had a companion for this long!
What a fucking legend
Wow! My father-in-law had a cat that lived to around 22 but was a little worse for wear :) looking pretty spry for a 21-year-old cat!
Awhhh
Omg I really hope my kitty lives a long life like him
My gal is 16 right now. I‚Äôve had her since before I could hardly walk. I hope she will live long and comfortably enough to to experience the same adventures your cat has, though I realise that‚Äôs likely unrealistic, but I can still hope. I‚Äôm very happy to hear of your journey through life shared with your cat. This has lightened my stressful day.
Bless his furry little heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
Lucky
His journey with u is not over yet...
I feel this. My old lady is 13 and she‚Äôs seen me through A LOT.
It's very rare we find companionship for that long. 
It's heart warming
Makes me miss my old friend I lost a few years ago at 18. They being such joy and love to us without asking for much in return.
This makes my heart so happy. I have a 15 year old girl who is still fairly healthy and whom I got when I was 14 from the shelter. So far she has been through my teens and college , as well as moving from two different houses. I am hoping that she will be with me through marriage and kids as well. It is nice to see people who have such a special bond with their animals and take care of them through the entirety of their life. Best wishes to your and your pal.
I lost my old girl on New Year's Eve last year.  She had made it to 19.  I hope that he's got some more years left to see your baby grow and give him pets.
So, was there a 4 month wait to meet this baby?
I hope my cat lives to see me do something in my life, anyways your cat is pretty awesome!
We're getting your cat drunk!
This is taking my breath away. I‚Äôm heart is racing, my breath is short. You are talking about LOVE. And nothing hits me like LOVE.

Thanks for sharing, I‚Äôm telling you, these days? Every drop of this good stuff matters and you just unrolled a proper flood. Bless you both, this is a story of the ages and I‚Äôm choked up just writing about how it‚Äôs landing for me.

Man, I love a good friend that‚Äôs a cat!
Aww happy birthday!
Awww~
Sweet life story üòª
Gosh that is so hard. I'm sorry for your loss. Your friend is somewhere safe and beautiful now, waiting peacefully to see you again.

Awwww!! So sweet

This made me tear up so much. I miss my jojo :(
Get that cat a beer
Your cat loves you too.  I'll not forget seeing love in a cat's eyes for the first time.  I didn't need him to love me.  I had enough for the both of us.  He could take mine and I would be grateful for it, even proud.  He's a cat, I said, like I knew anything at all.
That's awesome you got to bring him to college to ! What did he think of dorm life?
i love you and i don't even know u kitty :)
Sweet boyüíó
Amazing cat.üëç
That's great That's fantastic.. My cat Screwball is 15 yrs old and he sleeps with me..walks with me.. One day I'm either or he will find one of us didn't wake up.. I'd be lost without him
that's one sweet cat. lucky you!
scritch that belly, plz
What a beauty <3
This is very special indeed. I kept a stray kitten when I was in kindergarten after he climbed into my mom‚Äôs car. He was super close with me, and I had him all the way into my first couple years of college. He lived to be 16.5 years, and just passed a couple months ago. 

It‚Äôs so precious to be able to grow up with an animal from a younger age like that. It‚Äôs just something you never forget and cherish forever <3
Aww.. hes been there for you and you're there for him. He's a beaut!
If your cat just turned 21 it's exactly a day older than me haha
Those eyes tell of so many years. 
May he continue to live long üíï
Lilac Point Siamese? He looks just like my Hermione girl. 14 years old and still going  ‚ù§Ô∏è
Love Forever!
We have the same birthday! Happy birthday Gato üòÅ
What a handsome young man :‚Äô) You‚Äôre so lucky, OP
What a sweetie pie ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ã
this is beautiful. my cat is going on 5 now and I can‚Äôt imagine life without him. any tips on food brands or any tips on how you‚Äôve achieved this level of longevity with your adorable furry best friend? love this post!!
You might or might not read this.

But you're such a wholesome human. Spread your love, you good person.
Blue-points FTW! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I had the most amazing blue-point when I was a freshman in high school. He thought he was a person, to the point we could walk him in the park without a leash, he greeted everyone at the door by sprinting up to them and standing on his hind legs to say hi, and being totally put out there was no place for him at the dinner table so he would bring a bite of food in and chew it next to us.
OP, there is ‚Äúcat wine‚Äù made from cat nip online, kitty needs a toast for making it to the legal drinking age! I‚Äôm so happy for you that you have had the chance to spend so many momentous occasions with your fur baby. ‚ù§Ô∏è
The only cat I ever bonded with also made it to 21. You're incredibly lucky to have a friend like that for so long üß°
Noble
Fuck..I‚Äôm 21 and and I have lived through is going to school and finally I get to decide what to pack into my lunch box
It amazing to think that for how many life events our main constant has been a beloved cat. You and your friend are truly blessed
Sorry for your loss,that brought tears to my eyes dude .
‚ù§Ô∏è
Must have had more than 9 lives. üíïüíïüíï
Oh hell yeah dude. That‚Äôs a fuckin good kitty right there.
*sobbing into my cat‚Äôs belly*
Happy birthday!!!
I vote for best kitty
Happy 21st birthday sweet boy!
Thats a good buddy right there
Amazing eyes ‚ù§Ô∏è
Damn, that cat is older than Shrek.
He just refuses to die
What a beautiful little face and friendship!!!!

My Skye was also a blue point Siamese and I was blessed to have her for 19 1/2 years as well. She was my first baby, best buddy, and the most patient girl ever when my kids were born even though she was already an old girl of 15. 

Thanks for sharing him with us and letting so many of us share our memories in return! I suddenly have something in my eyes here...
Awww!!! I think my cats the same breed and he‚Äôs 17-18 (inherited him around age 12). He‚Äôs my companion and his personality has gotten stronger and stronger every year lol.
Bless your hearts.  What a sweet baby.
Old cats are great. The males mellow out and send to become more affectionate in their retirement
My old man is also 21.  He blind and is on a RX diet but goodness is he spoiled rotten.  I love him to pieces, he‚Äôs the only man who‚Äôs never left me!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è how lucky you both are! Love it!
Has anyone ever had a cat die of old age? Ours did a year ago. Seemed to be very little suffering. (We loves her, and would‚Äôve done the right thing). Never found anyone who has had a pet pass from old age. Pumpkin was about 18.
Mine is almost 17 , she has been my best friend since i was 4 and helped me through bullying and stuff (im almost 21 now)
:(
A CAT FROM THE 20TH CENTURY!1!!!2‚Äô
I had a cat who turned 19 and I thought that was awesome. Wow, 21. He just held out to see your baby and you know it.
I had a cat that i got right out of college and single. Got married a few years later  He accepted the wife, we had a kid and he loved my son as well. About that time, he started going through kidney failure. Held on long enough to meet my youngest. Passed a couple months later. One of my favorite photos is of him in the crib with my new son, cuddling his feet. Tore me up when we finally had to let him go. Nine years later, I finally have a new kitten who is laying in bed with me now. She'll likely be here when the kids are gone, which is wild to think about. She has some big paw prints to fill, but she's doing a pretty good job.
Omg, I love this so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I love seeing pets that are older than me...I‚Äôm a couple months short of 21! Wishing both of you health and happiness!
What a good boy! You're doing a great job caring for him!
That is an amazing cat.
What a beautiful and dapper chap ‚ù§Ô∏è
This made my heart smile. Love long and prosper üññüèº
The close-up image of you reflected in his eyes is really cool.
I‚Äôm at a point in my life where I‚Äôm finally able to adopt a kitty of my own, and give it a nice warm bed. But I fear for those final years.. I love with all my heart, I‚Äôm scared of how I‚Äôll handle it.. but the love and companionship outweighs the cons I believe.
His name?
Lost my doggone unexpectedly in April. Never considered a cat. Im 35 and single and I might be kinda considering at cat friend because I work too much and don't feel like I have enough time for a dog. That and I could get 20 years instead of 10.
He knew, there's no way anything goes the distance like that and not know
Fuck that's an old gato.
OMFG MY HEART
He's a good old boy who had a loving friend in you!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
‚ù§Ô∏è
When you look into his eyes I feel like they say everything about his wonderful life
Wow.
He's in fantastic shape for 21, congrats. Pretty boy!
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
üíñüíñüíñüíñüíñ
Aww, he's wonderful.  Cheers, old boy!
I had a sweet long haired black cat named Maggie who made it to 22. I unfortunately harassed her when I was little, but made up for it by providing her a warm lap to rest on when she was an old gal. She's the oldest living cat I've ever had. It's a great and wonderful thing when they stick with us for so long.
Pure love. I love it!
So cute!
Your cat looks a little raccoonish and I mean in a good way.
Lucky
What is your cats name? I have something for this, but i need this darling fur balls name first.
Waaah I'm crying!
Dude idk how I'll cope if my cat died. Thinking about it just makes me tear up. I wish I never adopted a pet, because now I have this connection with her and I just don't know what I would do if she passes away.
Your kitty looks like my 2.5 year old Stanny...  if Stanny can look as good as ur cat at that age thatd be crazy cool
I thought you meant you just turned 21 years and I was wondering how you managed to marry, finish college and have a baby at 21.
You're very fortunate to have him. He looks pretty good for his age.
Had a wonderful cat make it just past 21. Some cats are just very different. He was like one of my brothers. Hobbes. Yours looks like a special guy too.
I cry for lose of your friend and being reminded of our pets mortality. We should remember its the journey that matters and not the destination.
What‚Äôs his name?
Is that enough emoji I see???? Cute cat but an instant downvote.
Brb crying
We don't deserve animal companions but we can try to make it up to them.
He has wisdom eyes
Thta's awesome, cat still looks healthy and probably full of energy.

Mine is around 16, crazy to think I was in HS when I got her and now I've been in my house and working full time for over 10 years.
I had Smokey, a long-haired version of yours. He made it to 21, with lots of seizures over the last year. We had our first legal drink, and I had to take him to the vet to be put to sleep. A hard day.
This is wonderful, my boy was almost 19 and passed yesterday. Thank you for posting yours
Be sure to tell him every day.
What a handsome fellow!
Wow, that's a really sweet story and he's a handsome cat. My parents got cats several years before I was born, and the younger one, Max, would apparently snuggle up to my mother's belly when she was pregnant. Once I was born, he was always so gentle with me.
What a beauty!
Great picture
What a beautiful kitty. You‚Äôre very lucky. Keep cherishing every moment you have with him as you are. He looks happy and healthy for his age. I‚Äôm 36 and my best furbuddy is 18 and I just found out he has mouth cancer and doesn‚Äôt have long. It‚Äôs really difficult and I‚Äôm going to miss him terribly. My mom just passed away less than a month ago so it feels overwhelming to lose him too. I know he doesn‚Äôt have long but he‚Äôs still being so sweet, loving and trying to be there for me and I am incredibly thankful for the time I have and still have with him. I spend every moment I can with him nearby and he rarely leaves my side. Cats can be the absolute best companions so I‚Äôm warmed by how thankful and appreciative you are of yours. Cheers friend. :)
Is that your reflection in his eye? He's gorgeous and you must be an excellent pet parent.
Hugs!
My grandmother has a cat that is about to turn 20. It‚Äôs a whole year older than I am. I was raised with that cat as my older sister, I‚Äôm gonna miss her when she‚Äôs gone
Old, but still baby.
Cat died, might as well get some internet points out of it.
Kitty Prayers.      üêæüêæ
GOD BLESS YOU BABY!!
hopefully he at least has a few more years to him... 4 more years and kitty can rent a car
where did you get a 4 month old baby?
Sweet boy, what an amazing life hes had. You should be proud of what you gave him and what you guys got to share ‚ù§
Cats r best friends
Wow, so much love and understanding in those eyes.
A nicey boy!
So precious ü•∫
We dont deserve animals as pets. Animals are honest, people not so much
üòç
But I am 21...
Beautiful boy!  Is he still..... around?
What a sweet boy!
I lost a couple of cats I'd know since I was 6 years old a few years back. One was 19 and one was 20. We adopted them both as kittens. They lived their entire lives as best buddies and passed on within months of one another. Never going to forget them as long as I live. RIP Blue and Snowball.
You can see the whole world of love and trust in his eye.
I lost my dude last year when he was just shy of 20. They would be about the same age. It really is something special and I honestly struggle without my best friend, like there is nothing that fills the void losing him has left. Good luck to you guys and happy birthday to your cool looking bro.
His eyes are so beautiful! I hope he is doing well
I have such a soft spot for older cats. Spoil him while he‚Äôs still around. You‚Äôll regret it if you don‚Äôt
Ooooooh, my heart...It‚Äôs criminal how they can‚Äôt last as long as us, they are the purest beings in life.
Xoxo
Love this.
Wonderful. Ours lasted to 20. Blessing.
Beautiful cat. Beautiful story.
I've only had my furry soul mate for just over a year, and he's already 12 years old. I hope I get to keep him for many, many years longer.
Cherish every single moment you have him, which it sounds like you already do.
That's wonderful.  Cutie
Good kitty....
I‚Äôm not cutting onions, YOU are..... <sniff sniff>....
Your Meows looks like my (actual name) Meow! Much love and goodness always!
You have the memories at least.
But what is his name?!
He is precious and looks so vibrant still!
I love when old cats get all scruffy. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I gave up my Blue Point boi up to the great beyond a year ago and I still miss him every day. More personality than some people, and he gave the best hugs. He was more than I deserved and still a total jerk.
Hey, nice beard dude.
So precious
She‚Äôs a beautiful cat
Beautiful boy ü•∫
‚ù§Ô∏èI had my wasabi(male) and Ms. America (female] 21 and20 yrs .
They were brother and sister and I miss them dearly. Thanks fo sharing your baby
he's so cute! i used to have an 18yr old cat, but she died. i don't wanna talk about that tough. he's so cute and i'm happy he's lived so long !!
My sweet boy made it to 21 and then died a month later. It‚Äôs been a year but boy do I still miss him. Hug your baby for me.
Why does this look photoshoped
Cute
Oh gosh, how wonderful. My dog watched me grow through highschool, college, first job, marriage, and lived one month with my husband and I together as a married couple. Unfortunately he died at age 18. I will never forget this dog.. he was by me through all the life changes, struggles, hardship, and success. I hope your cat lives until grandkids come üôÇ
And I'm sure you have given him an awesome life all those years ‚ô•
Thank you so much for giving her the longest bestest life.
‚ù§Ô∏è

You gave him a great life! Congratulations and love to you both
He has the most precious little eyes
I have a kitty that's 22 yrs old.

She eats like a pig and probably doesn't weigh 3lbs. She's skin and bones.

Stone deaf and has the biggest mouth in the house because of it. 

She lives a hard life, eat and sleep. She does plenty of both.
Omg thanks for sharing. Incredible üôèüôèüôè
No mames ese gato est√° bien c*****
Please send him my hugs and scritches!
wow.
I‚Äôm so happy for you and for him. I wish you both nothing but the best üíï
I cry every time I think of how little time I have with my 15 year old cat. He's been there for me through the absolute worst days of my life and I don't know if I can go on with any type of times without him and his comforting snuggles.
Absolute gentleman.
Lad.
My cat Charley was the best cat ever, she was always so happy and loving and loved. She became listless  and never went out , always sleeping , hardly ate all her food and became  double incontinant . She walked with a wobble and would often collapse whilst cleaning herself . My wife took her to the vets for a consultation and they were unable to find records for her on the computer, they were able to find archived records on paper in the basement. Her body was breaking down and her quality of life is diminishing. Twenty one years of my life ended that day when she went cat heaven. Love you Charley üêàüêàüêà
You two had a fun life
Enjoy every moment. Mine passed at 18 years, but saw me through a 10 year marriage,  3 kids, divorce, a move to a new state, and starting a new life.
So awesome!
‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
SO RAD!!!
Nice!  My previous cat lived for 19 years.  Got her after my first day of Kindergarten.  Was with us through all my school years including 4 years of college and then a year working full time in my career.

Took a break from pets for almost 15 years and now we have two new cats...  We got our first one in Jan 2019 and then a second in March 2020 literally right before the lockdown.  We were so busy with the new one that the first two months were basically a blur for us.  We're very grateful for them since they've made quarantine life tolerable.
What a wise old soul. He‚Äôs a guardian in cat form. What a giftü•∞
My lifelong feline friend passed in January. I miss him so deeply and this was such a wonderful post to see today. Thankyou.
My cat was 25 going on 26 died in my arm one evening and I didn‚Äôt know till I went down to pet her and she didn‚Äôt move. Sad but she live a beautiful life
He looks like a Lovey Boy.
There are cats older than me... mind actually blown
Oh so sweet üíïüíïüíïüíïa beautiful story to share with us. Thank you
My childhood dog of 16 years died a few months ago. Still miss her everyday.
He looks great! I have a 16 year old dog. It would be wonderful to have her 5 more years.
I don't believe this cat is 21, looks atleast 5 years.
Good job, old man .... keeping your family safe and protected.
That‚Äôs a miracle that it‚Äôs still alive!! God must of have known how much me meant to you to keep him alive for so long.
What a sweet baby boy!! His whiskers are still straight as an arrow.

I'm sure the old boy can still catch a bird with the best of them.

Cats eyes so cool when they get old. My boy is almost 13 and his are getting there. Makes me sad but I hope I‚Äôll still have many more years with him
Happy 21stüíï
I love that we can see you in her eyes.
Love old cats, makes me feel good knowing people can care for them so many years
I appreciate your boy, ours just passed away at 18. I didn‚Äôt realize how much he was a part of our family until he was gone. Cherish him as you do.
Wow what a special cat!!!! My beautiful cat passed at 18 years old and I thought that was long üôÇ
Happy tears
You can be seen in his eyes :) nice catto

You're very fortunate of having such company. congratulation!!
He looks a lot like my old best friend Simon who was with me for most of my life before passing away a few years ago. Reading this made me feel so many things. Mostly glad for you and this experience. Im so thankful for relationships like this. You are very lucky to have had a love like this. I am sure meeting your new baby meant as much to him as it did to you.
Doesn‚Äôt look a day past 6 or 7!

Here's to the next 21.
That cat is older than i am by 3 months. Thats fucking crazy!
He looks like what I expect my boy to grow up looking like. He‚Äôs 8 now.
Incredible. üíïüíïüíïüíï
Where was he for the first three months of your baby‚Äôs life?
Amazing
What a wonderful boy! I know exactly what you mean. I was just trying to describe the cat who was my soul mate for 17 1/2 lucky years to a person who's not an animal lover, and they just didn't get it. I hope he lives for another ten years and gives you all the love and joy you and your family need. A great cat is a joy forever. For those who don't know: you just don't understand. Love and hugs!
How sweet. My cat, Matilda, was with me for 21 years. She passed in 2004, and I still dream about her, and sometimes miss her so much I cry.
Amazing
The reason why this has so many awards is cus it‚Äôs heart warming and those people got cheered up what a sweet cat I wish could give an award but I don‚Äôt have the money for that god bless you and ur cat.
CUTIE
Jesus Christ this cat was around for JNCO‚Äôs
I can't give you an award, only an upvote, but I can say I'm sorry the baby passed away, I'm glad he left such a great significance on your life, and I hope he's in a better place ..
Sweet kid!!!!
Awww! One of my Kitty's is 5 years old today, I'm praying her and my other kitty make it long enough to see me get married and have a kid, I don't know what I'd do if I lost them, my house would be so empty
Beautiful cat-  Very wise looking. Old cats are always a powerful presence.
You're so fortunate to have him hang around for that long. Wish my guys would have.
he is a sweet and gentle young man
Aww looks just like my guy who made it to 21. Miss him and his nonstop meow.
Oh, what a sweet boy! ‚ù§Ô∏è
You've taken good care of him. My cat is also 21 years old but showing signs he is getting old now.
Happy birthday!!!!! üéâ
What a legend. I would be worried letting my cat go out at night. What a lovely cat. A testament to good ownership so a tip of the cap to you too sir.
I am happy that you have had your companion for so long. I just lost mine not 3 weeks ago. He only made it to 16 but was with me from 13 on. Was with me through growing up and many relationships and life hardships. Treasure the time you have.
What a good boy!

That chongus looks like a baby at heart, what a wonderful kitter
Beloved boy <3
Looks like wore out beinie baby!
Ughgh!  I‚Äôm happy and jealous that you‚Äôve had so much time with your cat. We just recently lost both of our cats of 16 years (brother and sister) a couple of months apart. I miss them dearly. Our 5 year old missed them even more.  Especially the male cat. Two of them were inseparable. We did get three new kittens to ease the pain but man, I would yeet them out the house in a heartbeat to have my old fogies back.
What is your secret?
So cute!!!
Love it!
Awwwee, congratulations!! I am so happy for you!! We lost our beloved girl two weeks before her 20th birthday. He is lovely
That‚Äôs a kitty that is loyal, and always wanted to make sure they‚Äôre by your side - sure that you‚Äôre doing well ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have tears in my eyes. I have no time for people who can't understand how amazing the cat, dogs and other pets we bring into our lives really are. Most really aren't all that big, but they take up such a huge place in our lives and our hearts. 
Happy Birthday little dude, and here's to many more healthy years.
God Bless this baby!!
Only reason I don‚Äôt have a cat is because my mom and my best friend and my brother are all allergic

Edit: I have birds now so getting a cat anyway is off the table for now

I still really would love to have a cat
wow this actually brought tears to my eyes. cats are so special!
AWww...da puddin

Reminds me of **Nibble**....a mutt-born Russian Grey my mom had, he was a perfect sillver-gray with lips and beans a solid charcoal, and eyes of green that looked like a stylist painted him with with absolute black eyeliner

....and he ***loved*** weed !

Seriously, if you didn't **properly** hide your "stash"....

It got ***"Nibbled" !***

:D
Wow that is crazy old for a cat. You are so lucky. My eldest cat was 17 when she had to be put down. Hardest day ever. Enjoy ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Your cat is somewhere around 126 years old
I love this. I had a cat live to 22, I‚Äôm praying my one now does. He‚Äôs been with me through it all ‚ù§Ô∏è
 

Awww.  Those are just too cute..my parents had one when i lived at home. Just  they have a such short lifespan compared to smaller cats! That hurts me  too much to think of to get one! Hope yours will live for a long time  still <3
I come here for wholesome things, not to fucking cry.

He looks like my Blue Minx Tonkinese! Mine just had a reputed cyst in her eye that now looks like a dangly little black sack. Does he have something similar? I'm seeing the dark area in his left eye. Apparently Tonkinese/Burmese are more susceptible to have it.
Start giving him CBD
