r/Catshuggingcats!
My girls were considered a bonded pair and had to be adopted together. Best decision I ever made.
I'm encouraged and uplifted when I read about shelters doing more, doing better for critters.
Just like my boys! How cute! Adopting bonded pair siblings was the best decision ever.

So sweet. I imagine if anything ever happened and my oldest 2 kitties had to end up in the shelter they would have to be adopted together too. They are definitely a bonded pair.  Oldest is almost 9 and other is almost 6, both of them would be devastated without the other. I have other cats and they get along, for the most part but none of them are as close as my oldest boys.
I wish more shelters did this. When my wife and I went to go adopt our little black cat, we noticed that he was playing unnaturally well with another tortie cat at the time of adoption. Come to figure out, they were both siblings found in the streets together before ending up in the shelter. The shelter was about to separate these two & I can‚Äôt fathom why... Fast forward several years later and they are still inseparable ‚ù§Ô∏è

"unfortunately you'll have to adopt both"

What are their names? So sweet

Oh. My. Gosh. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I found two kittens like this. I made it my rule as well. So far they're still with me and it's been more than a year. They are in fact, in separable.

[This is my cat tax if you need to know](https://old.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/kgqd87/the_brothers_on_a_cold_rainy_day/)
Thank you for doing that. I adopted a pair of sisters and they call out to each other if they're out of sight
When I rescued my cats they had to be bought together they weren‚Äôt biological sisters but one of them definitely adopted the other one as a little sister and they love eachother
So sweet!
I adopted 2 brothers. They were rescued before a hurricane hit. I got 1 and someone else got his brother. Well apparently the brother cried and wailed for 2 days. The lady who rescued them asked me if i could take the brother for a few days until shelters opened back up. I agreed of course and the brother never made a peep. I knew after the first night i had just adopted 2 kitties not 1. No regrets! They're 18 now and i can't imagine not having them both!
You are blessed
That‚Äôs a good rule. I encourage everyone to adopt some siblings. I have two, and they‚Äôre so in love. Best friends for over a decade.
The Toronto humane society lists them as bonded pairs, I think it‚Äôs really considerate for them to acknowledge the detriment it would be to separate cats in circumstances such as this. I also applaud those who understand this and are able to give them forever homes, thank you!
Wish I could give this a thousand upvotes...so precious! Happy New Year, BTW!
My heart!
way too cute
My family adopted siblings that the people who bottle fed them refused to separate. We really wanted a pair anyways. In fact, the boy looks almost exactly like the gray tabby on the right. We love them so much ‚ù§Ô∏è
Are they adopted yet?
Thank you for adopting them together
I got a bonded pair of kittens in June and it was the best decision. Along with being adorable they also play with each other in ways I can‚Äôt. In addition they have each other as best friends so when I have to go to work or leave the house they aren‚Äôt bored; they just cuddle or wrestle all day!
My first two cats, the older girl made the male kitten poop himself the first day. We made the mistake of bringing her home first so she thought she owned the territory and bringing another cat in two days later made her mad. 

Now she bathes him regularly and meows at night if she cannot find him still, years later. Even if you cannot find siblings try to find two cats so they have some cat to love in addition to their human slaves.

And when introducing a new cat to the house keep them separated by a door at first so they can slowly get used to each other. We are up to five cats now and they are all a cuddly swarm but it takes time for some cats.
My boys were the same way when they were this small!! They weren't littermates but just loved to share their cat tree bowls together. Now they're both too big to fit together so one just plops on top of the other one on the couch lol
bless that shelter! they love each other so much
My fianc√© and I found 5 kittens by our apartments dumpster last winter. We took them all in. Found homes for 3 and kept two. Both annoy the shit out of each other, but occasionally they‚Äôll cuddle and sleep with one another haha
Omg this warms my heart! We adopted two full blooded sisters and their half brother. Beyond grateful
This level of cute should not be legal
And this just melted my heart. A right decision was made!
Oh my freaking god. I would post a picture right now of my two kittens I have under the same exact circumstances, I just never fucking learned how to properly post a picture on forums

Edit: like really. We went all in on getting one cat and we loved both cats, but then learned we would be forced to adopt both. At first I was like WTF idk...but I am so glad I did. I am watching them play fight right now
I love them. Crazy that they are so different looking!
Beautiful and adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you for taking them both and keeping them together!
I adopted two 11 year old bonded brothers that were also a package deal. They are so sweet with each other.
Soooooo precious!!!
Do you just randomly set things on fire because of how intoxicatingly adorable these fur nuggets are?
Very good!! Never separate!!
Augh! Auuuuuuuuugh! I am screaming because it's a cuteness overload for my brain! XD

That is a most excellent rule about adoption...besides, look at this! They are being so adorable together! =3

<3
That's called a bonded pair, and it's a common requirement.

Our cats were bonded, but because they didn't cuddle, the shelter thought they could be split. Turns out they stopped eating when split up.
Yeeees! I have a pair of bonded siblings too, they‚Äôre relationship is so sweet and adorably beautiful, especially them being the only two in their litter.

Having two cats that adore each other like yours do is just so heart warming
We rescued a couple 3month-old kittens about a month ago now that sleep like this most the time and it just makes me so happy seeing them love each other so much
Wholesome content :‚ÄôD
Bonded pair kitties are the best! We‚Äôve had ours for a few years now, and they spend more time apart than they used to, but I still find them like this (taken just yesterday)

What sweeties!! I adopted two cats in May of this year. They ended up being a mother and one of the kittens from the litter brought to the rescue with the mother cat. I had no idea they were related in that way, they both just gave me the best and most comforting vibe when I was visiting with the cats they brought out for me to chill with. It‚Äôs no wonder, now that I see them together, that they are so close. Thinking back, the mother cat was totally hovering and watching me play with her sweet and unbelievably friendly little girl. 

They couldn‚Äôt have fit in any better with my little family. I could not recommend adopting pairs more. I feel like it made a huge difference in acclamation. Gonna go cuddle my little girls now!
Reminds me of my cats. Brother and sister. 
https://i.imgur.com/Rx1H21R.jpg
I adopted brothers too, one throws up and the other eats it.
I wish more people were like this!
The person we adopted our cats from also wanted us to take orange one also cuz they were buddies.
ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è
Good on the shelter. I love that they care
My two tortoiseshell kitties are sisters and my mom couldn't break them up when she went to the pound. Now I have the tortoiseshell sister kitties from mom. I love that the shelter does this. If they're bonded they're bonded don't break them up.
You‚Äôre the fucking best my guy. Cheers to you and your new family.
Gah.  I love bonded kitty pairs. I have a deeply bonded pair and I love seeing them snuggle all day, groom each other, fight for a minute before vigorously cleaning each other again.  It's so sweet.  All kitties should be so lucky.
My cats are bonded and even though they‚Äôre not super cuddly with each other they are super emotionally dependent. When I move furniture or otherwise stress them out you can really see their dynamic come out. One will scout out the new changes while the other kinda watches his back. If one gets freaked out they both run away.
Awwww. I remembered an old article about a blind dog. The blind dog has small dog companion and will get anxious when that companion leaves. The small dog assists the blind dog. And the animal pound says those two must be adopted together and have a trustworthy owner.
My cats were like this until a week and a half ago. They were litter mates, she came out to check on him when we caught him with a bag of lunch meat. 14 years later and they'd never been apart for more than a couple hours when they got fixed. 

She seems to be handling him being put to sleep fairly well, though. Sometimes goes to the door he was taken out of and sits, watching it, but OK otherwise.
Our two cats are brothers and they cuddle like that also.   Best decision we ever made to take them together.
This is the best thing I've seen all year
It‚Äôs this content for me.
/r/Tiedyesky Our cats... they are the same!!

Cats don‚Äôt like being alone. You should always get at least 2.
Adopting siblings is great. There was a litter born at my office complex and the others had been adopted out except for two brothers. So we took them both home. They're the sweetest cats. One of them is clearly the runt because he's a lot smaller than his brother. But they cuddle and play with each other and clean each other. It's adorable.
‚ÄúJust hold on we‚Äôre going home...‚Äù
I‚Äôd give this post a reward if I had money
I don‚Äôt even like cats, but I can‚Äôt help smiling when I see two of them who actually like each other this much. Glad things are working out for y‚Äôall.
Makes me hope [these guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iriBuIunNYM&ab_channel=grimchuck) got adopted together as well.

My heart just melted... that is the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen :)
Shelter made a good rule. I was going to adopt one cat, but adopted two when it was clear that they shouldn't be separated
i love that this is the first thing I saw this year.
I‚Äôm so happy but also jelly!!! I wish my cats liked eachother enough to cuddle. Never seen my cats even groom each other
My two cats does the same! It is sooo cute :D
The shelter I volunteer for frequently deems certain cats as "bonded pairs" and requires that they are adopted together.
This post right here is why I'm getting another cat. it's not for me it's for the first cat. They both are going to go mental and hate each other, but I really feel that I owe the first cat the opportunity to have this
Omg I need cats that are this close. I gave away my the brother of my cat last summer and I regret it. She needs a close cat companion.
I hope this post summons a SchnoodleDoodle poem. It‚Äôll probably make me tear up like usual too.
We had 2 strays that we picked up when I was younger. The first one, my mom got in 1985 when she was living in an apartment with my dad snd older brother. She heard meowing coming from the parking lot. My mom, the kitty lover she is, swooped up the all black kitten and named her Spanky.

The next kitty, Tiffany, showed up on Halloween night in 1989. My mom put up flyers and did sll she could to find the pwners because she knew 2 cats from different litters would be hard, and it was. Spanky was the OG kitty but Tiffany was very territorial. They would ambush each other or wake me up at 4am when I was a kid to see them fighting. 

We moved to the Bay Area from L.A. in 1994, and on our way up my mom drove a Volvo station wagon and put them in thd back with a covered litterbox. When we arrived to the East Bay, they were both huddled together in the box, but other than that, they were always territorial.

Now, fast forward to 2009(rip to my babies) but time had passed; Tiffany lived to be 20 !(which is why I love r/seniorkitties) but we decided to get a pair of kittens. This time, we got a brother and sister and it has been an absolute dream knowing that they have each other. My dad is retired and my mon has always been an at-home Mama but there is nothing greater than getting texts at 2pm of thdm in the sink together or bathing each other.

Good job for keeping them together. I had 2 greyhounds, adopted almost 2 years apart, and they were inseparable. When one passed the other soon followed :(
I think they are made for each other cats
We set out to get a cat and ended up with 2 for the same reason

Omg so sweet
Thank you for keeping them together, and I am thankful the shelter knew these two well enough to know to find someone who can take them both.
I had the same thing happen to me when I went to the nyc humane society in 2002 and fell in love with a cat that shared a cage with the Devil of a cat and said if you want this sweetie, Patches, well, you gotta take her cage mate as they are bonded.  Did it!  And I fell in love with both and they both lived to just under 20.  I so miss my Lucifer and Patches!
What animals have to go though!! They are stronger then humans!!
That sounds like our 2 boys.   Technically cousins born 1 week apart they have always been together.    Stormy has always watched over Copper. 
So glad we could keep them together
Wow, cute
You‚Äôre gonna need a bigger basket! ü•∞
Awe!!! They recommended we took brother and sister as well. So we did... just not the sister they recommended. Still worked out great!
Something that fucking cute will mean fast adoption for those 2.

Now I'm sure they still love each other but not showing it as much.
I bet I can get them apart. Hold my beer
We got a bonded pair like this, the shelter said they separated them for 1 night to see if they could be adopted separately, apparently they cried and were visibly stressed. They are 2 now and still sleep like this everyday. It's GD adorable every time.
I adopted a pair of sibling Maine Coons from the shelter that likewise had to go as a pair.  They explored the house room-by-room together.
Cats don't sleep at night anymore than they sleep during the day.
THERE IS ONE RULE THAT SHALL NEVER BE BROKEN:

NEVER SEPERATE FRIENDS- BE IT ANIMOL OR HUMANO!
These cats being like this in the shelter makes me think some animals have more "consciousness" as in more developed to a quasi-human extent. Where they search for this other and learn these things and have more human display of affection. 

Like when you watch an animal and think like "This one makes me think of a human because of their behavior sometimes"
Cats r so misjudged I mean LOOK AT DIS 

Well stray cats r maybe dangerous

Are they still up for adoption? I would love to give them both a good home and lots of love

Step Sis?
My ex-boyfriend adopted a pair of bonded cat brothers and they were the best. They loved play fighting but at the end of the day, they would always fall asleep snuggling each other. Last I heard, that pos ex got rid of them after he dumped me. I cried more over the cats than I did over him. I hope they weren't separated when rehomed because separating a bonded pair can cause significant damage and trauma. I saw a photo once of a cat who's bonded sibling was adopted but not him and he looked so sad, like he was about to cry at any moment. I cried for that cat.
They better be the same gender, otherwise theyd breed like crazy.
LITTLE BABES
Did they?
I have two cats that look exactly like both of these and they always sleep hugging each other! Did you break into my house?
I feel sad when I think about what happens to the other when one dies

Naww cats cuddles with BFF. Having two cats is always better than one üòä
That is fucking adorable
I'm jealous. We have two cats, siblings with the same colors as those, that also used to sleep like that and love each other. When they were a bit over a year old, they stopped and now barely tolerate each other and will hiss when the other gets to close.
Nothing cuter than a bonded pair!
This is too goshdarn cute
That's so friggin' cute !
Awww!

It reminds me of the shelter I volunteered at. There were bunnies that were bonded pairs, and there was always someone who wanted to adopt only one. Of course, they'd never be separated because they were already such close friends it'd be awful to separate them. It's only natural that kitties would be the same way. <3
So much cuteness such purrr
I usually just cruise reddit and barely upvote anything but I couldn‚Äôt hit that up arrow fast enough. Beautiful!
I have two cats that tolerates each other, sometimes groom each other, but would almost always end in a stand off (and sometimes a fight). I would adopt these two in a heartbeat.

This reminds me of my two boys Lenny and Carl.
Just a head's up for anybody adopting siblings of the opposite sex:

Sibling cats do not spend their lives together in the natural world. You absolutely must spay and neuter them before the male cat experiences horniness. The male cat will spend the rest of his life dominating and acting aggressive against the female cat if you do this too late.

I have 2 sister kitties. They sleep on top of each other too. Not identical as one loves her workout wheel while the other doesn't trust it.
Aww
This is so cute ‚ô•Ô∏è
I ended up adopting siblings. I was initially looking for one cat, but they had a 2 for 1 deal going on and they were brother and sister. Turned out to be a good decision. They entertain each other and rarely fight.  The brother even sits back and his sister eat first whenever I feed them.
When I git my first ferret, I still feel bad but we separated him from his cage mate, idk if they were siblings or not. 

He seemed like he was missing something and after about 6 months with him we felt confident we wanted a 2nd so we got a young one about half his size and age. 

They bonded day 1 and almost every night can be found snuggled together. Except now the younger one is almost double his size lol. 

They're beside my bed both crammed into a single tiny hammock right now even though the cage has at least 4 sleeping areas.

I hope the ferret we left got a good home and a friend too. 

Also adopted a pair of kittens this year and they're  cuddlers too, but have made it their mission to make the other 3 cats cuddlers. They've been doggedly determined, one loved them from the start but the two tabbies are a both more weary of other cats / affection but I caught one cuddling her for about 20 seconds before getting up and moving today.
When I got my pup from the breeder I picked her out at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks when we could pick her up the breeder through a adoption party!  Hands down the best breeder ever. She only had one litter of puppies and all of them knew their names and were pretty much pottie trained when we picked them up. She used to be a long haul truck driver who did this in her retirement to keep her active. Everyone picked up their dogs that Saturday and we all kind of hung out for a few hours having appetizers and drinks (non alcoholic). 

The puppies were all playing and naturally we socialized. I had driven 1.5 hours for this pup and was already in love with her. We FaceTimed a few times after I picked her out at 4 weeks and she sent us photos of her all the time. Turns out one of the other adoptive parents lived 10 minutes from my house. We exchanged phone numbers and over the past 6 years we got together every few months at the dog park. My dog had quite a few friends who she loves to see, but she is always so much more excited to see her bio sister than anyone else. It‚Äôs like overtime she has remembered that they are siblings. I told the lady if for some reason she ever needed to give up her pup we would take her no questions asked. Unfortunately that hasn‚Äôt been the case, but she does drop her off at my house occasionally to pet sit for her while she‚Äôs on vacation. My Scarlett is always sooo excited and even though I have another dog and they don‚Äôt cuddle together ever she always cuddles with her sister. When they are together they are inseparable never more than like a foot apart. I feel bad that they don‚Äôt live together with how much they care for each other. It now almost seems wrong to separate pups from their family. I know that this isn‚Äôt as much of an issue for dogs that never see their siblings again though. 

Another little thing is my buddy Jim‚Äôs dogs. His lab Charlie had puppies and he gave them all away except for a doofy chocolate lab named Murphy. One of the labs he gave away went to a neighbor down the street about 6 houses away. Everyone once in a while he escapes at about 3pm because his parents don‚Äôt get home from work until about 5:30-6. He runs straight to Jim‚Äôs house. The first time Jim found him at his door barking he put him back in his yard and told the owners their dog got out. Well he did this kind of a lot and would re escape and beat Jim back to his house. So Jim started just putting him in his backyard til his parents got home. A lot of time Jim gets home from work (construction) and the boy is either walking his way over to Jim‚Äôs house or is at the side gate waiting to he let in. The mom and both siblings would just play constantly until the boys parents came to pick him up. It became kind of a routine a few days a week. Now when his parents come home if he isn‚Äôt there they just go to Jim‚Äôs place where they get him from the side gate and he‚Äôs always happy as can he. 

In short a lot of people think that pets don‚Äôt remember their family members once some time has gone by and they are adopted out. In my experience most pets dogs, cats, birds, even sugar gliders remember their family members and have a strong bond. Even my sugar gliders which I have 3 of all females the two that are siblings are much closer than the one who is younger and only a half sister. I love seeing animals adopted with their siblings.
Now I really want a cat
Tanjirou is that you
We just adopted two cats that look a lot like these two.  They fostered together and we did not want to separate them.
The cat on the left looks almost like one of my cats I had
How are they called?
I'll take 10
Yes, don't keep your Cats alone, they May (Sometimes) hunt Alone and don't Form Packs but they do get lonely
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
OMG THIER SO CUTE
Very cute. I had two kittens that were adopted the same way (not sister by blood, but had to be adopted together because they had grown close). Would always cuddle like this as well :D
"Cat fusion ha!!!"
Kudos to the shelter for instating that rule!
Hey, how are you my childhood friend, where did you stay? I met you today after so many days.....!
When me and my wife went to look at shelter cats we fell instantly for a brother and sister who had been found with 2 moms and 2 other kittens in a plastic bag in a dumpster. We asked if we could get them both but only one was available for adoption and since we were originally planning on only getting one we agreed to take that one.

Then when they came and delivered our new cat to us they brought both to us anyway! Turns out the other cats new family was planning on breeding with it, which the shelter doesn't allow since there's no way to tell what their lineage is like, so they opted on giving us both instead. And they even gave us the second one for free. Since then they've lived happily in our family (currently living with my wife's parents due to them having more space and an outdoor area they can safely be in) and they used to snuggle like this all the time and still do from time to time.

Cats are cute as hell and we felt really bad about almost separating our 2 and we are so glad it ended as it did :)
Good job on the shelter ‚ù§Ô∏è what wonderful cats!
Do cats do Alabama? I think it isn't a problem with rats, but with cats?
One of the great regrets of my life (there are many) was adopting a dog without his brother.  I couldve had two small red heelers.  But we left with just one.

I am a monster.
Shelters should just pretend kittens are siblings to encourage people to adopt together. People think cats are assholes, but they can get depressed on their own.
Wait are there names peanut butter and jelly, because I saved two cats that looked like this that were sleeping in my kayak underneath my deck and brought them to the shelter. the cats were also inseparable and the shelter made it so they needed to be adopted together.
Oh my goodness precious children! I want my next adoption to be a bonded pair too üò≠
Wow! that's awesome so many messages in this photo.
One of my cats cuddle me like this. It‚Äôs the best kind of hug that a cat can give. This is precious
"Its enough to make a grown man cry, you go on ahead tear"
Bonded pairs
What kind is the dark one? That fur pattern is awesome.
That‚Äôs just like our Dweezil & Moon Unit ‚ù§Ô∏è ever since we found them they‚Äôve been absolutely inseparable. We were just going to get them healthy and Rehome them (together) but we fell in love and couldn‚Äôt part with them lol
We found two abandoned kitties in our garden that look just like that, only the black one is all black.
They're sisters but they never cuddle togethet :D
We have a bonded pair too.  They are adorable, fight like real siblings, but end up cuddling together in the end.

Incredible ‚ù§Ô∏è
I have a bonded pair. They are virtually inseparable (unless the little one starts putting on airs and forgets just who the boss is between the two of them...) and won‚Äôt even eat or sleep without the other. The older cat even grooms the younger one even though they are both full grown now.

It‚Äôs incredibly sweet, but also a little worrying because they both become clearly distressed if separated. Even just a few hours while one is at the vet is enough for them to start showing clear anxiety. However, with the less than pleasant start they both got to life, I can‚Äôt blame them for holding on to each other like this!
Liar
How can I adopt them??? Please?
No they don't.

Lamo tat is so incest smh

Dear OP, 

I used to work at a cat shelter five years ago and cared for two kittens who layed JUST like that with the SAME markings. Did you happen to pick up these cuties in California?? That would be a crazy coincidence that I saw this post. I need to know they're doing okay!!!

- cat shelter lady
If only my sister did that 2 me, but she doesn't love me, she hates my gutz and bullies me every day
Cats turned into hentai
 Blood clots
Yep must be real, cats only sleep at night
