That feeling when he stole your girl, but he stole your heart too.
That pic truly explains how he stole your girlfriend - he's adorable.😍
Franco deserves my non-existent girlfriend too
He's such a happy kitty :')
[deleted]
That is the happiest cat I’ve ever seen!
Looking good, Mista Steal Yo Gurl!
Hell, Franco stole me and I'm not even yours, what a cutie 😍😍😍
Did he also win a war against Spain in 1939?
I mean...she isn't wrong...
Almost looks like he's taking a selfie.
So darn cute!!!
The cutest little mush!!
He looks like a cheeky little cat......the best kind.
That's a remarkably adorable cat
I am sitting here crying over my cat Tora, who died two weeks ago in an accident at home. Franco got me to laugh a little, he is a heart breaker for sure. Thanks for sharing.

r/teefies
Oh my goodness!
That is one adorable cat and some awesome timing for the picture.
Omg it’s perfect
Think this may be the best and cutest picture of a cat I've ever seen!
Please start an instagram page for Franco!
A lot of people in Spain disagree
That is one adorable and photogenic kitten ☺️🐱
How did you get the cutest kitten in the history of existence? No fair!!
he’s such a happy baby
Named after the Spanish Dictator?
He really stole your girlfriend? You’ve got to be kitting me! He’s stolen much more than that. He’s stolen 132k updoots.
The barely-there teefies, oh my heart ❤️😻
I just think in:

#FRANCO

#FRANCO

#FRANCO
Honestly of someone has such a cute kitten I'd get married to them immediately.
Smooth Criminal
That is one of the cutest faces (love the smile!) I've ever seen.
My husband understands and has released me to Franco's care.
This pic needs to be in the urban dictionary next to Mr. StealYoGirl.
That might be the happiest face I've ever seen
He stole me from my boyfriend too! I love Franco!
He's so cute!
I've actually experienced that too. Girl left me, but the guy was such a catch that it almost made it easier. Looks like you've got the right perspective.  No shame in losing a battle to that guy.
What a wonderful smile that little cutie has! He is stealing everyone's heart!
he could bite me and I'll thank him for it
I love him just like that, first glance.
And now he stole all your reddit friends aswell
You've got to be kitten me that's adorable
Poor thing, you never had a chance.
Oh those baby teefers
God damn it, he just stole my girlfriend.
Would let him bite and kick me. So adorable
Well he stole my heart now 🥰
I can see how he stole her. Look at that Uber cute cat face!
Tiny teef
What a beautiful Cat!
He looks like he was drawn by Disney!
Damn, that is one cute cat.
Every girl loves a great smile and just look at his! Perfect grin right there.
Look at me. I'm the boyfriend now. [face_somalian]
look at those eyes, franco is brad pitt of cats
does he have insta?
He probably is the cutest cat I’ve ever seen, and I’ve seen a lot of cats. Perfect photo.
We demand more pics of Franco
This is the world's most adorable kitten!!! Pleeeaassseee start and Instagram account dedicated to him!!
Can’t compete with that million dollar smile bro. 😍
You never stood a chance
You didn't stand a chance.
To a Spaniard calling your cat Franco is like a German calling it Adolf.
What's a girlfriend?
What a beautiful Pokémon, what ball did you catch him in?
Ya you didn't have much of a chance lol
Well damn. He is f’n adorable.
Franco's on here about to steal everyones girlfriend.
As in James Franco?
I have a warning to make as the husband of a cat-loving wife. 


It doesn't stop with one. They keep multiplying. You won't have just one.


Franco will need a furry friend to play with. And then you'll rescue another one and keep that one too. And if you're semi allergic, you'll always wake up congested. And if you never wanted a cat you'll still end up cleaning the litterbox or feeding them because now you have a living breathing thing or multiple living breathing things under your care. Did I mention vet bills? No insurance. Cat with urinary issues? Special food for urinary issues.


And space. Because they need not one but four cat trees. And scratchers. And toys. All over the floor. Toys everywhere. And when they shed, which is every single day of your allergy-ridden life, hair everywhere. Hair on your bed, on the floor, on the couch, in your food. So. Much. Hair. And then, puked up hairballs. And gouged or scratched up arms and legs from scratches. Make sure to clip their claws and get them used to having them trimmed often (never declaw!). And sometimes little sleep from the zoomies and pouncing on the bed at 3am. 





And it's worth it. All of it. 

For the cuddles. And the purrs. And the loving head bumps and rubs. And the meows. And the listening ears. And the acrobatics. And the entertaining speed runs. Cats are great. I love mine.
Oh my goodness. That is an adorable happy kitty.
OMG... He is adorable! By the looks of him, I think he's gonna be a handful..!
Enjoy and all the best!
Hey it's okay man you can't expect to complete with that
u/mennawageeh
Ya dude look at that face. No one has a chance vs that face. We’d all lose our gfs to that
Looks like my kitten! I posted a photo of her this morning on here so you can see in my history if you're curious!
Love it. I got a story. I was away for a month for a training op. During which my wife rescued a cat (named lucyfur). She’s normally not a cat person but our apartment only allowed cats. Landlord hated dogs barking. Anyway. I came home for a week before I had to head back for another month. Lucyfur fell in love with me. Followed me everywhere. Couldn’t take a crap without that cat meowing at my door. I packed up and headed out once more. Lucyfur was not happy. She meowed constantly, sat near the bathroom door to meow some more. She peed in my wife’s shoes and left cat poop on her side of the bed. This cat was quite aptly named. She tormented my wife for the entire month until I returned. I loved that cat for years but my wife never got over how mean lucyfur was to her.
General Franco
Oh my goodness! Those eyes!
What if OP is a cat.
And girlfriend is a cat. 
And this whole thing is kind of weird.
I would stab myself in the belly for Franco
Aaaaaadorable! I want.
He is so cute, [I had to do a sketch of him.](https://i.imgur.com/26rZyLL.jpg)
He stole your girlfriend, and now I'm about to steal him.

Franco's picture is a sight for sore eyes... thank you.
So precious!! r/ntbdbiwdfta 😻💙
Is this real pic?  too cute to be true...
tbh i would leave you for anybody
Something about his face reminds me of Figaro from Pinocchio. (Just watched that recently btw and it's very unenjoyable, it's basically just "You better not do anything bad or you're gonna get kidnapped and turned into a donkey!" lol)
I promised my girlfriend we can get one hehehehehhe
And there's me. Who stole my wife's cats favorite person slot
He could steal my boyfriend as well! You know... if  I had one :D Adorable!
Mmmmm, Franco, really...
Spain remembers
Woah, that’s a cute cat
That's the cutest thing I've ever seen
I’m sorry, the picture is adorable but as a recent kitten mom, my teething scars sting from looking at that picture. He’s not happy- he’s hungry for hands!
Would be stolen by him any day
OMG!
U guys have girlfriends?
I'm scared for the animals in the pet shelters because of the Coronavirus pandemic. People may stop going to the shelters but I hope not.
Kitty also stole my heart!
Virgin vs chad
Half cat half wolf!
That guy could steal anyone.
Stole my heart too ❤
What a face. He steals my heart , that’s for sure! Pretty handsome kitty 😻
Probably doesn't know yet that he is not a human.
Look at his lil toofies:DDD
I think he just stole my heart too and I’m not a cat person
We also have a "Mr. Steal yo girl" at my house :D
I'm sorry.
Those razor blade teeth
What a cute kitty! He looks so much like my dearly departed Desi when we first brought him home. Miss him so much!
I get so jealous of cat pictures and videos on here. How sweet some of them are. My cat is a demon spawn from hell. He’s such an ass hole.
Ooooohhhh what a cutie!!
Francooooo...as a Pittsburgh native, I approve of this name lol
The authentic catdog, looks part husky!
He stole everyone's hearts
Named after the brutal dictator
I'd leave you for him too, he seems like he knows he way around the bedroom
I work in IT. The past few days have been...challenging. I am saving this for the garuanteed smiles.

Misnamed.  Cat should be named Chad.
He looks like a furry
You can just tell by his face that this is gonna be one of those kitties that loves to wake up at 5am to run around and play.
so cute kitty
Also, reminds me of Hades after telling a joke that fell flat.
Haven't been this choked up since I got a piece of musaka caught in my throat.
He stole your girlfriend because when you weren't looking he flashed her that smile.
Awwwww
With a face like that, I don't think it's even possible to be mad at him.
Normally on the front page of reddit I get bored of always politics and animal pictures. But damn if that little cat didn’t make me smile:)
that's a cute little fascist!
Awww so cute!!!
Julio!
Cat does a :D
Hello Franco 🐱
He has stolen my heart too and I don’t think my girlfriend would mind.
Until Franco grows up to be a huge asshole after making it to the big screen and then you're left with the shell of the man you once loved. Fuck you James. Eat my shorts.
I, too, have a Franco.  Well met!

https://i.imgur.com/7euEPtQ.jpg
He’s a better Franco than me
Look at those teefies
This little guy is just plain adorable. Not all kitties look joyful.
That smile though.
Oh he’s going to have a great life
Aww, he looks like a kitten! Don’t worry, eventually all kittens turn into assholes. Just don’t be a bigger asshole than the cat, you’re good.
A happy fuzz ball
I have a Husky mix named Franco! Same color fur too
Sooo cute!!
Franco is certainly the HAPPIEST cat I’ve seen!!! He’s smiling from ear to ear. Cute!
I'm a straight male and Franco stole my heart too bro... Look at that smile, what a handsome bastard 😻.

I would die for Franco
Omg that's the most adorable face ever. So perfect. Wish my kittens would do that..!
Im the cat in the photo AMA
Just a reminder, those kitten-teeth can/will pop off as he grows older.  I'd forgotten this and got scared shitless when our kitten lost his.
Surely this is a cat who yells.
I love it!
if Disney tried to make a live action kitty 

THIS is the level of expression we needed in the lion king
Now that’s a photogenic kitty!

Is that a General Hospital reference, a James Franco reference, or both?
Holy cow, that's an adorable face!

As a spaniard reading these comments, this feels super weird.
He didn't even want to steal her

Cats are cute when they’re kittens, and they’re still cute as adult cats, but man, they can be very independent and selfish. But they’re worth it, ba-dum-dum-dum.

Edit:
Check out my history, everyone. Ive nothing to hide. u/derangedMUSED is a troll. I encourage you to compare our comment histories. I am reporting the troll, so she’ll be banned eventually, like her other troll accounts, u/Amuptee, u/-TwistTheKnife-, u/Evil_Heat, and much more.

She’s upset that her accounts have gotten banned while mine hasn’t; why is that? Cause I dont troll like her. The other user this troll is accusing me of being? It’s another user SHE used to troll. She likes to play the victim, but piss her off, and her true colors come out.
Fake
Your kitty looks part husky LOL
What about sex?
Interesting choice to name your cat after a Spanish fascist leader

*stole my girlfriend*

The cats body secretly looks very hot under his fur and the fur quickly regrows before someone else sees it, as if the cat genuinely wants to steal your girlfriend by using his magical powers
So damn adorable, must resist to squeeeee!
Listen, he can steal me too.
Th cat occupied your girlfriend possibly, distracting your girlfriend from taking care of herself like she should be, but you still have access to her. Stupid.
He would steal your boyfriend too, if you had one.
Any dog under 50 pounds is a cat and cats are useless.

Accept the threesome!
