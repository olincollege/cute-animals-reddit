"My blind dog loves staring out of the window."
Dogger is a high-level manipulator. So shady, but so so so cute
Wow... just wow.... all he wanted to do was spend a little quality time with his human and you decide to work??? What is wrong with you, you heartless beast?
When this was failing to remedy the situation, he decided this was prime to release some hellish doggy gas into the room. 

Got me moving pretty quick to be fair.
That's almost worth an HR call.
Oh. My. God.... The thirst is unreal.

Working on my computer yesterday and I look over to see The Gus sitting on his blanket under our bedroom window just shaking and vibrating because I wasn't spending all my time with him.
Man this is effective. He got me to stop working already.
can you at least fix that frame
Pupset
I don't know. My border collie sits and stares at me. Endlessly. Your dog's more catlike approach seems less annoying.
I literally laughed out loud while saying ohhh baby - clearly this poor dog has never had a walk or a play in his life - terrible tragedy!

(Seriously though, he’s gorgeous and this is too funny, our lab used to think she had a set bedtime and would come into the living room and stare at us all when we stayed up too late and it was adorable, enjoy your time with him, it’s never as long as you want it to be)
"So cute! What kind?"  
"Jewish Mother."
No talk me angy
dog wins
"There he goes, reading reddit again, but still not playing with me!"
"Two can play this game human. I too will stare at wall and make click noises. 

Wait this game isn't fun. Is this really what you do everyday?"
The sass!!!   Cutie though.   And, it works.
Hooman ignore me, me ignore hooman
Go into a different room. Watch it walk in looking at you while pouting.
The trick is to pet him with your feet while you work.
My lab did the same thing yesterday! https://imgur.com/a/PnOhUog
PLAY WITH THE POOR DOG YOU MEANIE
The canine finger
Can...can you please straighten your picture frame? Your dog is cute, the pouting is cute, but the crooked frame...
r/petthedamndog
In my mind this is what dogs think we do by working/playing on computers.
One of mine was throwing a tantrum from his crate this morning because I thought he needed some down-time and he disagreed.  Hard to work with his soft chewbacca whimper alternating with his screaming bark just six feet away.  Finally, he and his two brothers are all taking the nap I knew he needed and life is peaceful again for a while.
My dog does the same thing but adds looking  over her shoulder to see if I’m looking at her to the routine.
the master of manipulation
You really gone and done it now...
Cute dog but ocd self ia obsessing on the misaligned frames.
It doesn't get better! I've been working from home the whole time I've had dogs, and the more velcro-ey of the two of them invents new methods of guilt tripping me every couple weeks. Right now, he's in the "sit next to mom just within her peripheral vision and place a single paw on her armrest" phase. He's also perfected his sad-sigh game.
When my dog was mad at us, he used to climb and lay on the windowsill and look out the window, ignoring us when we call.  We called it his emo teenage phase.
My dog puts his toy duck on my leg every 10 minutes or so just to see if I want to join in. If I don't move, he goes to the other room and rolls on his back and throws it to himself. He'll be back any minute to ask again.
A pandemic "stay at home" is a once in a lifetime opportunity, Karen!  Fine!  I'll just be over here with my wall!  It's not like you even care, Karen!
Wow. Your dog owns you! You're puppy whipped.
When your dog thinks a wall is more fun than you
I think you need a bigger picture for your wall
Please, fix the picture on the wall.
Can we see some more photos of this devious manipulator please?
Cute dog but that picture frame hurts my ocd
Damn, even I feel guilty. Thoughts & prayers to you OP. This is a dark day indeed.
You monster
Sorry, I just signed up for reddit. And I haven't found a job in a year
PLAY. WITH. THE. FUCKING. DOG.
My bird keeps calling me naughty and my cat doesn’t understand why she can’t have free reign while I’m working and can’t keep her away from said bird.
My cat does the same. Not because he wants to play or anything, just as a casual fuck you 🤷🏽‍♂️
Mine has come over to bark directly at me multiple times. 'What the heck, man?'
That picture frame is crooked and it’s triggering tf out of me.
Just start eating lunch.  He will be your bestie
Reverse dog shaming.
Call HR and let them know you have a hostile work environment. Paid vacation guaranteed
Oh that's really bad. It may be break time soon as that looks pretty serious and colleague relations need not break down any further.
Dogs and cats can get away with a lot of stuff. Using their cuteness to their advantage. But if a human does it, the outrage!
Exceptionally effective - would definitely work on me.
That’s a very spoiled dog.
My yellow lab used to sulk in empty bedrooms when she got in trouble for something. I think one time I told her off for biting my shoes.... then come dinner time and I couldn’t find her anywhere. Eventually I found her in the dark bedroom. She saw me and turned around. I had to give her a big hug and kisses before she could be convinced to come eat. She was such a smart manipulative dog. I miss her. 


My spaniel on the other hand is dumb as bricks.
No other choice but to quit your job
YTA
Aw man. He's so sad. Go do his favorite thing with him for 10 minutes.

One of these days he won't be around and you'll miss him greatly
But doggo, I have to work! Who do you think pays for your food?? C’mon, give me a break!
You should leave her. It is clear she no longer loves you. You deserve better than her and can do better. Don't stay in an abusive relationship, get out immediately!

Oh fine, here's a treat.
It's all your fault man... You should just give in to the manipulation...
My mother's cat does this when they have eaten the last canned food and I give them dry. The female jumps on the back of the couch and stares at the mural, avoiding eye contact.
/r/relationshipadvice would advise you to get out of this toxic environment
Has anyone ever noticed that Lab's are really good at pity parties?
 My dog does this every time after I take him to the vet. lol
I'm on the dog's side - because clearly there has been some people napping taking place, by the looks of that sofa.
Quit your job..... That's the only way 🤷
OMG...what a drama queen.  😂
My dog used to just lay his head down on my leg, look at me and sigh. He was a little turd but I loved him.
I’ve been getting similar attitude all week.
Mine looks like she is about to pack me some bags and throw me out my own house.
Dogs are master manipulators.
Your relationship is toxic your better off leaving
You are being shunned. It’s an Amish technique. It’s like slapping someone with silence.
Mine does something similar. He goes and pouts in the laundry room. Lol
Labs can do that better than any other pup!!!😄🥰
Report this to the top dog
r/petthedamndog
Play with that doggo right this instant
Are we sharing the same dog and we just don't know it? 🤔 https://imgur.com/EI2YPtA.jpg
On a normal timeline, this thread would be flooded with non-experts discussing head pressing, like they just walked out of the ER.
This is... somewhat heartbreaking. :|

Your dog is going to be beside itself when all this is over and everyone can play with everyone else again. :D
My dog, lately, has been walking with a limp, but only when we're not at the park.
when i brought a puppy home, my eight year old dog faced the wall for about 3 days
Brutal.
Can you readjust your picture on your wall please, thanks
You don't have a dog you have a girlfriend
How dare you!! 😂🤣Too cute!!
Oh he's good
I can either leave this at 108k or go up to 109k 🤔
Sit! No! No.... SIT!!! Sit damnit! Sitttttt..... 

*takes picture*

“I am being guilt tripped because i cannot play and need to work from home. This is high level manipulation.”
Poor little doggy, thankfully mine likes to sleep a lot, as long as I'm in close close proximity he lets me do my thing. But yeah the manipulation game is hard in your dog, you have me siding with him out here.
No your looking into it to much, he just found a treat but is a good boi and is waiting.
Oh id cave in a minute! No way i could ignore the pooch
My friend and I am college called that, Giving you the back!  Like, Talk To The Hand, that’s how animals say it!!
Go to HR and get the baby a snack.
Can u put both together work at home and play
Ayye lady give him a hug right now
The dog is a master
Awwwww 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈😂😂
Holy! Vector away dog? Never seen that before!
The attitude in that pupper, love it!
You monster... just kidding, how's work going?
Our dog used to do this. We called it “getting the bum.”  She was mad at us a lot.
Ignore me? Fine, two can play at that game
Pretty good at shunning.
My cat does this too.
My lab stared at the wall for a good 6 months after we brought our first child home from the hospital. The guilt trip is real!
Dogs are so SMART
Looks like doggo has got his front paws crossed!
Haha he’s self quarantining Himself
[deleted]
You must play now to be forgiven
My boss used air quotes during the "work from home" meeting. I think I'll be alright to play with my pup...
Look at the mental anguish you are causing! You need to stop what you are doing immediately, and tend to your dog's emotional well being. This may require 6-7 hours of constant attention, so you should plan ahead.
Is friday!!!!
Aweee
My dog also...lmao...
The real question is: does it work?
Is he sighing?
My dog does this too. If I don’t give her what she wants she will lay down with her nose in a corner of a house and she won’t respond to anything at all because I made her mad. The drama.
Same thing here buddy my dogs are begging 24-7 to talk them for a walk and just vibe instead of school work
awww
I'm in the same boat... But mine doesn't  guilt me into play time.. mine takes her squeeky ball and actually throws it at me by swinging her head with the ball in her mouth.  So imagine me on a video chat call or conference call and you hear this squeek sound as it hits me in my back... Or see a ball fly past the camera... It's annoying.
PRICELESS!!  🤣😄
Yeah same situation here, except it’s my cat... the furball wants to play all day long and of course, it’s not enough to use his toys by himself..
"Fucking traitor. You come home but you won't play with me. Liar >:(... "
Lol this is perfect for you both though. My dog keeps jumping on top of the couch and then stepping onto my keyboard before laying down across it. He’s kinda big too.

Other times, he uses his snout to try to close it while having a toy in his mouth
When this is all over and we have to go back to work, the guilt will be so much worse! This is just a taste. Poor pupper!
Just gotta say r/PetTheDamnDog
At least you fell to high level manipulation and not the average kind.
That fatty wants another dog snack
Looks like he is giving himself a time out.
My five year old son is in the same boat!

>I’m on a conference call can you stop pulling my headphones off!
Mine are like bored kids.  I have to be their entertainment.
I feel guilty and I'm just looking at a picture of someone elses dog.
You monster
The highest!
My cat does the exact same thing!  Sits across the room, facing away from me, occasionally turning his head just a little bit to let out small, irritated noises just to make sure that I am looking at him and seeing how terrible a person I am.
The boss is quite upset it would seem lol
My cat does the exact same thing... Too bad it totally works on me though.
Awwww poor baby! Give him some attention! It’s an order! 😂🥰🥰🥰🥰
I feel you. I've been working from home as well. My dogs have gotten to the point where they really do anything they aren't supposed to. However, yesterday, my dog brought me a ball to play fetch and I was in a meeting. So I patted his head and said I couldn't. After my meeting, I went downstairs to discover he had chewed through my surround sound cable.
My cat did something like that too!
r/petthedamndog
This is a cat
Poor doggy!!!! How are you not caving

When I was a kid we had a dog that we would put in time out like a toddler when he was in trouble. He would sit in the corner and look at the wall, quite like your doggo. It was adorable, quite like your manipulative dog there.
You should've seen the red flags early on OP!
Hey OP, it's me, your boss. You are excused from professional duties for the day. And scratch ~~me~~ him.
If he keeps doing this, he's sick and take him to the vet asap.
It's hard to complain to H.R. when H.R. is the problem.
This is the wall the pupper faces when it's tired if interacting with all the ghosts in your home
Ok then just pout!
No talk me angy
You're home! Time to play? Woo hoo! Wait. What? You don't want to play with me? Your bestest friend? Fine then. I'll just sit here and stare at the wall.
One of my dogs has learned to say “momma” and screeches it loudly and mournfully at my wife whenever she isn’t paying it enough attention.
First Name: Dexter. 
Middle name: Machiavelli
Do it the way we handle a coworker like this in the office: Throw him a bone!
Biggest house cat I’ve ever seen.
my cat likes to scream at a blank white wall. i cant figure it out theres nothing on it.
Nobody puts baby in the corner but baby.
Reddit respone: DUMP THE BITCH
"It's like you don't even love me anymore!" --your dog probably
WELL YOUNG LADY OR YOUNG MAN YOU JUST STOP WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT NOW...and play with doggo. Just simply submit a copy of this picture with all documents & presentations. Please just remember to also send a short video of when you're playing with him, focus camera on wagging tail. This shud get you an instant promotion as well. What where you thinking? Surely you don't work for a monster!?!?!
Getting similar treatment from my cats. They'll walk back and forth, or just sit, in front of my monitor to get my attention. I'll give them some brief pets before having to brush them away, so I can actually see my work. This repeats 5 or 6 times until they get frustrated and storm off in a huff, until they're ready to try again.
Have the pupper near/under the table/on the bed(my office is the bed), and have one hand free to pet the pupper. That's what I'm doing with my kitties, and puppers
Divorce him/her.
My first smile today.  Thanks for posting this.
I have been W@H for years. They get used to it eventually.
My doggo is much more aggressive. He's a 90 pound Cane Corso/Mastiff and is constantly trying to climb in my lap during video meetings. I have to take him on two mile walks every lunch break just to tire him out so I can get anything done in the afternoon lol
We recently lost our sweet Max, a yellow lab. He was the MASTER at this! You KNOW they’re in on it when you get that big lab sigh.
I asked your pooch, " Is it possible to learn this power?"  " Not from a human."
Show this to your boss, they'll understand you need to take the day to care for a loved one
My pugs have their beds practically under my desk when I’m working from home. God forbid dad is more than a foot away from them. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Are you sure???? This is also a possible sign of mental health issues  is a dog. You may want to get them to a vet....
Put a picture of "outside" up with scheduled times. Reverse dogchology, woof.
ive been working from home for 2 years and no one believes that her not looking at me has been driving me nuts
I had to call the dr's office today... all but 4 people are working from home so I hear bark bark bark in the background haha she said he was good all day yesterday and slept while she worked but today he's upset  haha

"could you get out hooman?  I have sitting to do on the forbidden furniture and cord chewing to do while you're at work, please leave"
lol...my dog does this too!!
You’re a monster.

The crooked frame is hurting me on a personal level.
Something about this picture really intrigues me. And that’s saying something because normally my OCD would force me to comment on the crooked picture frame but for some reason I like it
My cat has been a real bitch all week. Sorry,  I can't type, drink my coffee, use a mouse, and scratch under your chin. Something's gotta give,  buddy. 

It's you.
I wish my kid would do this when I cannot play and need to work.
The fact that your picture frame is uneven bothers me more than anything
Looks like someone watched Blair Witch project
My puppy does the same thing. Eventually he decided that [watching the apocalypse from our kitchen window](https://imgur.com/6ymWp1t) is more entertaining than watching me work. 

Eventually we agreed on 10 minutes play breaks after an hour of work.
Damn. I’d rather look at the wall than look at your face. That’s cold.
Pleeeeeeease fix your picture frame
You quit whatever your doing and throw the ball for that poor baby!
This is just what he does all day while you're not home
Passive aggressive to the next level. No of course I'm not mad.
[deleted]
The crooked picture makes me think you are in Oklahoma.
What a bitch.
Won't play with me he says,

Wall play with me , it says.
We had a dog that did this when she saw us load the camper because she knew she wasn't coming.
Our Newfoundland is almost 2 years old and goes to doggie daycare twice a week to play with his buddies. They just shut down due to COVID-19 and this morning Atlas was laying on the guilt-tripping hard, I feel your pain lol.
NO TALK, I ANGY
I feel this so hard. Basically all of my phone calls are three way calls. Me, my boss and my dog!
Omg I’m weak >.< how can you say no to that 🥺
Ha! Right! I know the feeling! Thank goodness dogs don’t have thumbs!
You’re doing him a big sad
r/neverhadaheadtrauma
Look what you made him do!
So adorable. 

My lab currently has an ear infection and I have to put cold drops in his ear twice a day.  He hates them. To get back at me, he won’t make eye contact with me and if I go to pet him, he will go and run under my bed. At first he did it because he was upset, but not anymore. He knows it upsets me when he runs away from me and I give him lots of love and treats to get his trust back. He is now totally playing me to get treats and more pets. 

Sometimes if I let him stay under the bed, he will come and stand by me until I go to pet him. Then right back under the bed.

Dude may be a doofus, but he really is smart. Also, he is gaining weight.
They're doing the thing you're supposed to do to train puppies!  "You're being a bad human.  You don't deserve my attention.  I'm gonna look away!"
He took it to the next level!
My rottie keeps bumping my hand off the mouse with her nose...
poor fellow
Do not negotiate with a terrorist
That frame being askew is probably bothering doggo as much as it is me-o.
My pupper Atlas waiting for me to pet him https://i.imgur.com/YgCaTIs.jpg
Lol adorable.  


My dog does the same thing...he will walk up to me and stare at me, put his chin on the chair, bark, squeek his toys and shake them around to play, if I'm at the couch he will shove his face into the back of the couch in between the cushions.  


It's so cute but makes me feel guilty, seems like he's super excited that I am home so we can play....but I can't lol
Is anyone else having mild OCD kicking in because the picture frame appears slightly tilted? No? Just me? ... Okay bai
This reminds me too much of Blair Witch
Awww that poor honey only wants some love. I been giving my honey a safe ingestible flavored 🦴bone during crucial work times
Expert level!
Pet the damned pupper anyway, if you don't then he'll do something more sad looking
Are you sure that's not a cat? because that's cat behavior.
Awww I want to hug him from behind and kiss his head. So cute!
A true mastermind, only children can guilt trip like that.
Omg lol
My dads dog just screams at him in his office until he plays with him
This is not manipulation, this is literal sadness.  The good part is doggo will get over it, but at the same time, it is literally heartbreaking.  

The trainer in me says get a couple treats next to wear you work, and when they bother you couple scritches, and when they sit/laydown, treats.
My dog is currently pouting as well. He is used to the limited time we are home being play time. His mind does not compute this new normal.
This is how animals get relief from sensory overload. It’s not so much that he needs to play as that he’s used to having copious alone time each day.  

source: am a human dog
NOBODY can sulk like a golden Lab. They are toddlers to the max!
fix that picture
Geez
does nobody see the crooked painting
Roxie is nicer than this
My dog sits like this also- but he’s blind.
I had a chow chow who would do this during baths. Would not look at you till the bath was over.
Hey I have the same doggy door cover/wind breaker thingy! I think I got it from Lidl, like, many, many years ago? *mind blown*
Fine I'll just stare at the wall too.
"uhhh I cannot throw a tennis ball because I'm trying to fit these classes into my work environment."

Throw the tennis ball you basic bitch.
poor baby!  My lab is like that too! He decides when it is time to play.
Huh... I have that same ottoman...
you obviously need to get him a puppy
Is that real? Lol. I wish I had a lab right now (and always).
My pup pushes his toys against your body until you play...
I'm ready play just jump on me and we started I'm happy you wanted try so I'm not syopppibg
This is so toxic of him. You need to cut him out of your life right now!!   And make sure to tell all your friends how he gaslighted you
Why work when doggo wants play
Sitting so still! I watched this video for like five minutes and he only moved a tiny bit.
Can you fix that crooked picture? Thank you.
I'm not locked in quarantine with you.... YOU'RE LOCKED IN QUARANTINE WITH ME!!!!!
You know when a dog faces away from you and doesn’t make eye contact they’re actually showing you respect. He may want you to play, but he/she thinks they’ll get that by being respectful...
Please straighten your picture...
Dogs are literally humans in doggo form
One of my cats loves to play fetch and he loves having me home so much. He keeps bringing me balls to throw for him even when I’m trying to work. lol
Doggie contacting mothership, does this daily even when nobody is around. You are not supposed to see that, ever. Reported to dogspace.
You’re a monster! A monster!
My cats wander up and down the hallway meowing.
ooh, that is fighting dirty!
Staffy does stuff like this all the time
I have bumps all over
How sure are you that there wasn’t a bug on the wall?
Ice cold!
This is my life!
It's not [pressing its nose into the wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_pressing) though, I hope.
Play with him you monster ;-;
My asshole dog is laying at my office door crying and scratching and barking. Constantly. She thinks she gets as many walks as she wants because i am home.
The title sounds like an r/insaneparents post.
Why is that picture on a wall not straight?
seems like he just wants you to straighten out that picture on the wall
No he farted and he's self punishing he's not a good boy till there is a punishment , it's over and the slate is clean
We call that “you got the butt” when our lab turns around and pouts.
Only if it’s successful, otherwise it’s just sad.
I know you as the owner know your dog and when he’s being a little sass. Adorable 😍 

Also just keep an eye out though because sometimes animals face walls as first signs of sickness. It’s a symptom I’ve overlooked and will always regret.
Nice art!
I really like your wooden floor!

Nice doggo, go and play with him right now, please!
He’s like “you don’t even exist to me right now”
A yellow lab?
I can just imagine them barking as well
Hello friend.

While I genuinely hope this isn't the case, if your dog has a habit of staring at walls it could be a serious cognitive health indicator you should investigate.

https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/health/why-dog-staring-at-wall/
Yet you had time to post on reddit. Get your shit together and play with your dog.
Your picture is crooked.

\*Edit\*

Nvm, read the other comments.
My dog likes to get up on my lap all cute when I sit down on the couch to take a break and then it’s just so hard to get back up again.
Drama level: Doggo
:(

y u do dis
Absolute manipulation
Excuse me sir we need more pics of this manipulator so we can identify him and report to popo
should be punished for not straightening that photo too.
My cat likes to hop on my desk- she won’t take no for an answer haha
Your picture is crooked.
Reminds me of that dog who, if he doesn't get pets, will go to someone else for pets & look back to see if his owner got jealous https://imgur.com/a/JYnHw1u
That’s mad cat back, dog version!
My dog does this to ha!
My lab does this same shit. Heavy exhales. Looking away. Sitting in front of walls
PLAY WITH HIM/HER YOU MONSTER!
Times like this I wish we could properly communicate with dogs.
I frigging love this
SUCH SHADE! I'm loving it
Please give pets. Move hus/her dog bed next to you
Tell me about it! I still have to go into work but the faces she gives me because I'm NOT staying in, it's like she knows other dogs get their moms right now but her. Every time I open the bedroom door her ears perk up and she tilts her head and I wanna cry. Best believe with my hours cut down shes about to get ALL THE WALKS AND ALL THE BRUSHIES.
My dog wants to go out every to hours. Does he have to go to the bathroom? Sometimes, but usually it's just to see if his buddy is outside next door.
"this is fucking bullshit"

- dog, probably
"You ignore me; I ignore you."
You’re being gaslighted! Leave that relationship while you can.
69k!
I have this more than once a day from my cat the guilt I feel
Wouldn't it be great if we let our pets dictate our working hours?
"You're dead to me".
I’m free to come play with him
Someone wants to be an outside dog.
My pupper does that, too!
How long did you go before caving in? ;)
My OCD only allows me to see that crooked picture on the wall. OP, please fix it
My dog does this annoying thing... She will be laying in the couch, relaxed, just cuddling. And I'll pet her or pat her head for a sec. Then she will come to me and whine to be pet more. And I won't because I don't want to constantly do it. Then after a minute or so of whining she will get off the couch and pout. Like, you were fine before to just sit here!!
Oh. My. Gosh.
That's adorable.  This is the best thing I've seen all day.
You’re doing good enough arranging your schedule around his 23-hour needs.
Psychological warfare
I hate the cold shoulder.
Sweet baby!
My dog say woooooowroowoo wooo. And stares at me, then puts her head in my lap and stares at me. Wish I could take her to the park but probably not recommended right now.
From the way this little angel is behaving I’m pretty you deserve it, sir.
The struggle is real.
You get coffee breaks and lunches, take pup for a damn walk! Please and thank you, have a great day!
Haha it definitely is high level manipulation! Your fur baby just wants all your attention !! 😝
Play on your breaks and lunch. Let him/her help you with your job. 🙂
My dog pouts when I'm busy and he wants to play.  I was spring cleaning the other day and he would follow me to every single room I went in and would exaggeratedly flump to the floor, let out a big sigh, and then glance at me quick to make sure I heard. He will then sigh even louder if I don't look at him just to make sure I know he's there.
You put the dog there like that, walked back and snapped a pic. Stop lying.
Labs just know man. Mine recently learned to turn the Xbox off with his nose when he wants to take a walk...
😂😂😂 smart baby ♥️
I can always tel when my cat is mad because I can’t drop everything to cuddle him. He goes directly to his bed and curls up facing away from me and if I get up and pet him out of guilt, he won’t acknowledge it at all, whereas usually if I simply look his way he starts loudly purring. He is the master of guilt trips, lol.
You still get a lunch break. Don’t you?
This picture is hilarious, but I do have compassion for all the pets that feel the stress in the air and notice people's patterns changing but can't be explained why.
Your co-worker is creating a hostile work environment, report him to HR.
This calls for you to quit your job and play with him 24/7
Ahh the old cold shoulder
I´m sorry for this cute goldie. :)
For god’s sake man! You can’t spare 5 minutes playing tug of war or fetch?!
How are they that smart to do this?
The only dog I’ve had that stared at walls did so when he started having doggy dementia. Is this normal for dogs? I’m curious because I’ve never seen this behavior in other dogs I’ve had.
Poor bebe
The dogs can tell something is different. They are very sensitive to social isolation.
my daughter has the same strategy
This is my 4yo these days too. We give her as much one one one time as we can, but those bills don’t pay themselves yo!
This made my day 🤣
Lmao!!   These Stinking animals are our life.  Their oblivion is refreshing. Their only opinions are what we feed them and how much attention they think they deserve lol. Bless our little four foots.
Mine is doing the same thing.  Just cuz we home, we cant always play.
Hilariously Hilarious!!
My niece does the same thing to me when I need to do homework. Needless to say, I never get homework done when I am around her
That's a very big yellow big dog
He mad.
OOF!  This hits right in the heart...
Just explain "if I don't do this, then no home, no play time and worst of all, no treats!". That should make the young man/lady understand!
You and I both my friend... I live alone and my dog doesn't understand that I'm here all day, sitting by my desk and ignoring him because I have to work. Tough times to be a dog.
At first I thought he was sitting on a subwoofer. Then I realized it is sub woofer.
How could you say no?!?
Aww, just play with him for 5 min.
Hahahaha!!! Smart pupper!!
Give him treats instead!
It's real, man. Me too!
Lol my dogs have been making me feel super guilty as well....
They are sometimes like little children. My pit gets all but hurt if i don't give her 30 minute scratching / loving pats every morning and starts pulling some passive aggressive shit.
Haha  masterclass
S tier
At first glance I thought it was a giant foot
WOW.  THE BEST WORST BOI.
Quick your fucking job now!
My dog lays on the floor on her side and stares at the wall with the forlorn expression of an orphan that has been abandoned by the only people that ever loved her... if I don't play with her for 10 minutes.
I love how smart this dog is!  I mean, the tactic must work.  :)
Straighten your picture pls !!
Throw him the ball. Now.
Let me guess... “you wonder where he gets it from.”
He wants u to spank his bum
your dogs will soon form a corridor of shame, with their backs turned to you when you leave..
He must know [my cat.](https://imgur.com/KbbgL0I)
Poor doggo thinks he's being ignored and is going to ignore you back
Snub to the max...
I'd last 5minutes before stopping work
Gotta love dogs.....lol
I see you also have a diva-dog on your hands! Mine hasn’t gone full self-timeout before, though! He just whines and barks at me, and since I try not to reward that behavior I ignore him until he’s quiet. Sometimes he goes quiet and just stares at me—which I then reward with attention—but sometimes he gets up, turns his whole body away from me, and refuses to acknowledge me with more than a major side-eye when I say his name. 

It takes at least 5 seconds of pets and kisses before he gets over it. So dramatic.
LOL thank you
My Mastiff Georgie - whines ever so softly then looks at me with big brown eyes and has her lead hanging out of her mouth. Master manipulator!
Pet her you monster! Whatever you're working can wait
Dog: but we always play when you are home, what do you mean you have to work? You did that when you were at work! Its play time!
Owner: I haven't gone to work for days.
Dog: your fault, not mine, let's play.
#gangster
Awww
When I read to shelter dogs they do this to me sometimes because I won’t take them for a walk (readers don’t walk). Awww.

This is my back, this is where you've stabbed me
mine too!! Hopefully this coming week I can start earlier morning walks to compensate. Hang in there hooman! your doggo loves ya!
Time out!
Are you going to straighten that picture frame?
Ha! Your guilt trip level is poor. I have been guilt tripped by the masters, and your attempt falls on deaf ears.

Also: that’s quite adorable.
That’s pro level manipulation!!!!
This looks like me tired of everything and everyone when I'm in school
Awh that poor thing! Man my cat does the same thing but during bed time though
My wife does this too
as you should be!
If my gf was a dog
Or it has cancer, dogs will headpress or sit facing a corner/wall for no apparent reason. (Its the tumor pressing on their brain)
"no talk to me I'm anger"
The FBI would like to know your location
he angy
Dogs are the cutest manipulators ever. I surrender evere f\*\*\*\*\* time haha.

"No no. It's okay. You don't have to play. I'll just stare at this blank wall. I'll be fine..."
So! In the dog house once again, are you?
How old is he or she? Wall staring for a long time is a symptom of dog/cat dementia. Sorry to shit on everyone's party, it's probably nothing.
I swear dogs are some of the most clever things out there do anything for fuss
Awww poor neglected peanut. Imma call 241- dogs baby just hang on.
“No talk, me angy”
That's what it has been like for me the last two weeks as well.
I’m guessing you told him to sit there, and took a photo for fake internet points.

Tell me!  Both kittens and dog are so offended!
Lmao, makes it hard to say no to!
You must be a garbage owner if your dog is doing that.
Man I would’ve thought of all people, dogs would be the happiest during this crisis since the ratio of home-time and walks must be up on average.

You might have a spoiled little brat on your hands there my friend. Who’s fault is that?

please straighten your photograph for the love of god my eyes
Be happy. At least you have a job. There are now 3.3 million americans out of work. This year is sure to lead to a major global economic crisis, with even more job losses

Work from home, if only, some of us are actually essential, I just wish I got more thank you then I do. I’m lucky if I get like 2 a day
