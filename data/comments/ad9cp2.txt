Hi, my name is Thomas, I'm here to take your order...

No, I'm here to actually take your order and eat it....
"A catpuccino please"
Well, don't just sit there admiring him, give him your order. He's waiting so patiently.
isn't that a little unsanitary?
I think that’s one of the cutest cats I’ve ever seen.
That cat is crazy photogenic and looks like the star of an animated movie. 
You want a customer for life? I mean grabbing a hot cup of coffee and a piece of banana bread and kicking back with a book, only to be graced with the luxurious presence of this little kitty. That kind of joy can only be compared to back in nineteen ninety eight when the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.


his eyes looks so cute
This reminds me of the "Neko Café" I used to visit when I lived in Turin. It's so relaxing to sit and drink a cup of tea with kittens going around you.
That little right paw slightly sticking out, so regal. 
#Which cafe?
You better have rubbed his belly.
Why do things like this never happen to me 😭😭
This is the best cafe everywhere. Cats without the entire cafe being based/themed around cats. 
Aww. What an adorable little health code violation!
Dude you must have like 300 years worth of reddit gold at this point.
Shittymorph is that cat about to be thrown off the table in 1998
That is the cutest cat in the entire world.
That's the cattest looking cat I've ever seen.
Pet him.  You may end up on a sidequest. I’m sure it’s worth it
I love how his foot is turned just a bit to the outside...as if he is posing so that you can take in all of his greatness.  Which he probably is.  I love him.
Alright what cafe is this and where is it I NEED TO PET THAT CAT
The table? Yeah right. That little guy hopped on my heart. 
Anyone know what breed he is?
Boop it! 
World is craving pet cafes.
PRIORITIES PEOPLE,PRIORITIES 
/r/supermodelcats 
I might never eat anywhere else. He/she is adorable. 
A wild Meowth as appeard!
What’s with the Undertaker jokes? Lol
I love it when pets come right up to you, without any apprehension. It clearly shows that they’ve never been abused and they’ve always had good experiences with humans. 
Best. Cafe. Ever. 
You misspelled "catfe"
This post makes life worth living
[removed]
This is the photo that should be used when defining a "Handsome cat".
I like cute animals, but that is gross.
Meow I take your order?
Great.  Nothing better than sitting down to a meal and realizing that eating and food prep surfaces have been contaminated by litter box paws and cat ass.  
We're closed! Nah, I'm just kitten.
This cat is how the  "Never let a cat sit on your table" rule would get broken. 
"Order please"
Where is this small cafe, Heaven?
Someone get that kitty a little bow tie.
I'd eat breakfast with that Lil guy any day of the week. 
I have to admit, I’d try to steal that cat. He’s adorable. 
Aww. I think there’s a cafe in Philly where they have cats. That’s so adorable..
I would go to a cafe near me if they had cats. Hell with the food quality, as long as it's passable and cheap. I'm not picky, I'll eat anything.

  


Let me play with cats the entire time and I'm there!
So uh where is this cafe again? Asking for a friend
On a scale of 1 to 10, how much do you want to adopt this cat? Me, 20!
Wow the cafe gives kitties instead of mints.... 
r/DisneyEyes
that face, those eyes 😍
My heart exploded.
How can you say no?
I can haz omlet?
Is this within 200 miles in Mississippi? Ill gladly put it on my bucket list. 
Give pets?
This is exactly what I need in my life. 
Well.....how did he taste? 
He's a handsome wee devil isn't he
He wants the God damn check
Is that a Pokemon?
Give him the toast asshole
That little baby would have gone right in my bag!  😁 😹
r/Disneyeyes!💜💜💜💜
Nothing this cute ever happens to me. Am I cursed?
What a cute little guy!
Customer: hey there, what's your name little fella?

Cat: it doesn't matter who I am, what matters is my plan...
He has a mission for you. Press 'A' to accept
that cat is fucking adorable!
“Why hello there”
did you tell him I love him?
I would be very okay with this 
I bet he catches mice in the kitchen
Off the table...  Off!
Yea that’s disgusting. 
Disgusting. They let cats on the table in a public place where people consume food and beverage? Cats walk through their own shit and many other things. I love my cats but they belong in the barn. 
What breed is this?
Damn thats a cute son of a bitch
Can I haz your milks?
He's adorable!  I bet he does Quality Control on all the tuna melts too, just to be extra thorough!
I volunteer at a non profit cat cafe in downtown Los Angeles and we have a little girl exactly like this for adoption. I struggle every day to not take her home. 😣
Then what were you eating
That cat is beautiful. Like an adoring artists rendition of a cat
I'd ask for a free meal. 
Claws with shit are on your table. Enjoy
Nasty.
Well was your wish granted?
Memories of Paris 
He's like give me food 
Catfe?

Oh my what a cute face <3
Upvoted because I actually said "Aww" before reading the subreddit.
Mig needs a bow tie 
Awwwww so adorable! ❤️
I actually had to check twice before I realised the little guy is not wearing a bowtie...
What a pleasant surprise! 
“Would you like to come back to my cave for tea?”
Was the breakfast any good?
His eyes!!! They're beaming intense cuteness I can't stand it!! 
Gray Tabby cats are the best. Nothing like a tiny tiger.

HI MIG TABLE KITTEN !
Comment Karma? What is it?
I feel like he’s about to inform me of a new quest.
Cross post to [r/workpets](reddit.com/r/workpets) 
Simply lovely!!!!!
I hope he got a nibble of your entree
Love me a good free range kitty. 
"Are you enjoying your meal?"
He so cute

Ok, can someone explain why people keep referencing the 1998 hell in a cell? I'm a wrestling fan, also a fan of cats, but I'm very confused.
Well hey handsome!
Cute little guy 
Cutest cat ever
What kind of cat is this?
I think I’d take a bullet for this  magnificent kitty. Thanks for sharing! 
Where is this cafe? I need to make friends with him
Irl puss in boots from Shrek
I was eating at an indoor/outdoor cafe in Marfa, TX a while back. A cat came over to my friend and me (we sat outside), and pretty much demanded we share with him. He wasn’t feral by any means, and jumped up in my lap. It was one of the most memorable meals I’ve had. 

Edit: Typo
😎cute
I once went to a hotel in Florida who had the sweetest outdoor cat.  I dint remember the name of the cat, but if you were swimming, it would sit and watch you, and if you were sunbathing it would lay next to you. 
he's your waiter
You can’t say no for that Innocent look. I would give all my food to him. 😊
Would this be considered a health violation?
Aside from the fact that it's a little unsanitary;  


# I'M GONNA NEED EXACT COORDINATES.
"The Galaxy is on Orion's buh, buh, belt-ah"
He has a quest for you. 
"Feed me or perish, mortal!"
This cat couldn’t be cuter. 
Would have so made my day!!!!
"Sir,Can i have some ?"
Really unsanitary. Wouldn't eat there if I were you.
very sanitary 
gross doesn’t that violate health code??
[removed]
I’d probably pet the cat, then kindly cancel my order and leave. Who knows where that cat’s butthole has been?

And is there also a litter box in that cafe?
#unsanitary 
You people really think your cats don’t walk all over your tables and counters when you’re at work? Relax, this restaurant 100% has a sign and everyone who thinks it’s nasty or are allergic to cats can just avoid it. Don’t think it could get any more simple 🤷🏼‍♀️
I wonder how long ago it had a dump before it sat there. 
Toxoplasma Gondii cafe
Sorry, it's cute, but get the fuck off my table cat where I'm about to eat... you dig in sand where you shit with those paws....

And I am a cat person, but no cats on counters or tables in my house ..

...butter lickers
I would never eat there again.  Do you know where that cat butt sitting on your table has been?
[removed]
[removed]
don't eat that

&#x200B;
people always forget cats dig around in their cat box then jump around on your tables and counters 
Probably an unpopular opinion, but  I don’t think animals should be hanging around where people eat.

I think cats are cute too, but I am extremely allergic. If this guy randomly hopped up where I was eating, that would fuck me up big time.
Am I the only person who would be extremely angry if this happened to me?
I know what sub this is, but cats walk in their litter box  when doing their business and is now walking on the table that OP is about to eat their lunch on... 
Edit- The cat is still cute, just be cute on the ground.
I know this sub loves cute kittens, but if a cat (which steps in its own waste) was walking on my table I would nope the fuck right out of that place and call the health department. 
Disgusting
Restaurant can't have animals, this must outside the USA 
Dirty cat litter laced paws on the table... Sanitary.

Edit: no, you're right guys. This is probably the one cat who washes their paws before jumping on the table.
one of you detectives tell me the name of the game on the table
He’s going to be a fluffyboi
Looks like it has a Reddit badge on
The galaxy is on Orion’s belt 
He’s perfect.
You don’t get that at a Starbucks!
how dare he sit on the table and not on your lap!
Is Mig a Pilot? 
SO CUTE :3
This would make my day
Stop eating. It deserves all of your food. 
Wish my cat wanted to hangout 
Feed me, slave
Lol he's cute, looks just like my kitty 😄
Hi, im sorry your food is gonna take a while longer, please accept cuddles in exchange
There will be a 20% cuteness surcharge for today's order. We accept many forms of payment including petting, catnip, fish, shrimp, kibble, or kitty treats. 
Where is this magical cafe?
What type of town do you have to live in where this is possible? 
he looks so polite
This cat looks so sophisticated
I would die of cuteness
awh so fluffy
he is so cuteeee 
Only cares if it was a big cafe. 
Hmmm no undertaker in sight..... 
Like in 1992 when...?
Quality control to taste test your food to verify it is up to par.

My name is Mig, no silly hooman I don't take orders I will tell you what you eat. Now worship me.
That's a handsome cat 
Gimme!

Is everything satisfactory with your meal?

Super cuteeeee <3
Is that the days special? At least it’s fresh. 
Now THAT is a cute cat
Reddit what kind of cat is this
Mig is a cutie! 💗
But when is he going to fall off and plummet sixteen feet through an announcer's table?
Soooo a dream come true? 
Awwwwwww
Would 11/10 go to that cafe just for the cat. Doesn’t matter how good or bad it is. 
That's the cutest health code violation if I have ever seen one!
I was having breakfast at a small cafe when suddenly this cute cat popped up on my table. This reminded me of a time back in nineteen ninety eight when the Hig threw Mig off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.


So cute!!!!
Special date.
SO CUTE 😍😍😍
those eyes. are melting me.....
Very cute and innocent kitten 😍
My name is puss in boots, “stay furry my friends.”
When did it get thrown off of Hell in A Cell?
Take me to this cafe
i love him so much. 
awwwww
You're officially in a Disney movie
Best barista 10000/2
♥️♥️♥️
Nothing would ruin my day if this little fur ball jumped up while I was eating. And yes, a show about Mig and Hig would be amazing. 

Well? Tip the cat! 
i love u
On to
I will take this kitty to go, please.
Those eyes..
I HATE cats but this is the cutest I've ever seen!
There seems to be two kind of people on here. The "aww, cute cat, that's brightened my day" folks and then the, " goodness, shoo you disease-ridden beast" people. I reckon I'd rather hang out with the first lot.
Omg it looks like it came out of a fairy tale book 
He's....so.....CUTE holy shit. I want to hug him and just hang out and drink sugary coffee while petting him all day. 
Wow, this post is making a run for the tippy top.
Hey kitty. Want a little morsel?
take him now
Oh my gawd. What a privilege!
This would fit really well in r/accidentalrenaissance 
Cute
What’s the little wooden box?
He wants a piece!
Absolutely purrrrfect
I think he's there to take your order. 
Life goals! He’s sooo cute 
No plate for the kitten cuisine?
r/wewantplates
Adorable kitten! Coloration of fur reminds me of my own, I need to find them and pet them now.
Yet when I hop up on a table people call me a drunk lol seriously though, I need this kitty in my life like yesterday!😍
The one time I see it’s you and you don’t even do it 
I sure hope you shared
So gorgeous.
I just want to be comment 1000.
This looks like the cat Orion from MIB, with the milky way marble on his "belt"
The cat has round eyes like the moon.
little floof 
Oh hello there little one. 
Shittymorph?! You’re alive!!
It wants you to share your meal.
Do. Not. Eat. The. Cat.
Omg damn that's a cute cat
If he was Orange I would call him Dewey. Anyone else ever read that book?
He's your waiter

Oh it's cause it's shittymorph no wonder it has all these random upvotes

Wait, is this the Dixon Mercantile in Dixon, MT?
Hello hooman, care to share some foods
This kitten can definitely has cheezburger with me anytime 💕
maybe he wanted to take your order?
As cute as he is, that's so unhygienic. I have 2 cats and they're absolutely not allowed on my table or counters. 
Well that’s pretty gross sanitary wise 
Jesus, I'll never understand reddit's fandom for litterbox bacteria on eating surfaces.

Bring on the downvotes, germophiles!
Aww, he came to gently place his butthole where you eat. 
Cute but I'd be paranoid about hair getting in my food
Cute and all, but hygienically ... not smart. Especially if the cat uses a liter box with other cats. Toxoplasmosis on the tables and chairs. Could be catastrophic for pregnant customers. 
No one gives a fuck
Fucking cats... he probably came straight from the litter box to sit on the table you're about to eat on. Bon appetit!
「STRAY CAT」
He's really effin cute
Is that in Cleveland? Somewhere in Cleveland they just opened up a cafe. That you can also rescue cats. 
What a gentleman.
Good meowning. 
I know this is really cute when you encounter random animals sometimes but I have a phobia of cats and if this happened to me at a cafe, I would die! 
Looks like you own a cat now
It doesn't even look like a real cat, it's so cute it looks like a Pixar animation! Give it... 
Gotta pay the cat tax if you wanna finish those fat stacks. 
Cat: You don't deserve to be here. 
I was supposed to pick up a kitten tonight after losing my little Stitch last year but my boyfriend changed his mind at the last minute about giving me a lift.

I'm now in bed sad and this cute kitteh is exactly what I needed 
"Orion"? That's a pretty name.
 I wouldn't mind. Such a cutie. 
Gross. I like cats but if one jumped up on a table, I'm leaving and not paying a cent for my meal. 
did it demand you go to bed?
"You asked to speak to the Meownager?"
What a beautiful fur baby!! 
The eyes say, "You has food for me?"
There's hair in your food.
The galaxy is on Orion’s Belt
I’ve never seen a cat who so much deserved a bow tie
Excuse me while I sneeze. Am allergic. Had two cats. 100% would pet.
Did you ask the waiter to wipe the cat asshole off your table?
So precious. He looks like he may speak at any moment 
Thats no ordinary kitten, thats the most fowl, cruel and bad tempered creature you've ever layed eyes on.
That’s fucking gross. Hope you don’t get toxoplasmosis. 
who doesn’t want animal Asshole on the table they are eating at?
On the table you ate at? In a restaurant? That's disgusting. I would have left or at the very least ask they remove their animal and clean my table. 
He should be wearing a bow tie instead of a collar. 
Is that the necklace that holds a universe within it from the original Men in Black movie?
Hello I’m your waiter how mayeow assist you 
Everyone wants cat hair in their omelet, how cute.
Heads up, his butthole is touching the table you're about to eat off of.
That face! 😍
I know I'm going to get down voted for this but ain't it against  health. code to have a animal walk around a place that sales  food also what happens if some one with allergy  wants to eat their 
Restaurants with Animals with their buttholes on the tables I eat on is not my cup of tea. 
Cute cat, but gross. 
That's unsanitary 
11/10 would dine here again and again

A shittymorph post that doesn't mention the undertaker? To the top with you!

You leave tip?

SO FUCKING CUTE!
This has to be the most photogenic cat I have ever seen in my life.  Mig is friggin' adorable!
That cat is friggin adorable! I had a similar thing happen to me a few weeks ago. My wife and I went back home for the holidays and were eating at one of our favorite taco places. We used to know all of the staff that worked their, but it's been long enough that we just know the owners and none of the new front of house people. We were finishing up dinner and asked one of the servers if they'd mind asking Marco to come out because "Lucosis is in town and wants to say hi." The server went back and didn't come out for like 15 or 20 minutes. We waited around munching on some Chips and Salsa when a little puppy from the next table came over and sat in the third chair at our table. We started petting him and the owners were just laughing about "He think's he's people!" The server comes out and says "Marco'll be out in a minute, but he wanted me to remind you that, in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table."
it’s a picture of a cat
Omg he is adorbs!! 😍
Looks like my cat when he was a kitten, he just just turned 21 this weekend and this brought back memories to when I got him as a kitten back in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off hеll in a cell, and plummeted sixteen feet through an announcer's table.
I'm in love with your cat. That is all. Thanks!
/u/the_main_moon
He works for the health department...its a trap. 
I'd end up trying to take it home, as I do every time I see a cat
Cute, but Definitely not sanitary. 
This is low key nasty man. Cats paws are so dirty from their litter boxes.
Yeah I don't care how cute that thing is, get those little shit mittens off the place I'm about to eat. Gross. 
Ewww. Hope it didn't get near the food. 
Or eww.  They step in their own shit regularly
Sorry but no animals on the table unless they are cooked
And there goes the health dept A rating.  Cute but ....
I think this guy needs a bow tie
I feel like he needs a bowtie
This little cutie can join me at any breakfast he wants !!
So cute this guy 
😑😑😑
forget about the food & i"ll take the cat 
Mein Gott! How rude!
Like in 1992 when...?
"Hi there let me puke on your eggs"
On to
As a person who is allergic to cats. This would be so cute but it would suck so bad. 
Pu...pu...put a bowtie on it
And what a handsome little man he is! 
So fluffy!
You gave it some food right? RIGHT?
Didn’t know Eevee had a cat evolution 
I saw OP's username and had flashbacks

just got done taking a shit in the litter box.
I would love this. Sadly my wife and son are allergic so I would have to shew this cute waiter away. 
I need this.
yesyouhavealloeditwhateveyousay
That's obviously the owner, I've heard he likes to visit most customers personally and taste their food.
hhh cute cat
Ugh,  those eyes 😻
Did you tip well when you took him home with you?
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Cat: hello, I love you won't you tell me your name
Might I recommend Cupcake and Dino? It's on Netflix. It's similar to what you described (but with a cupcake and a dinosaur), and it's hilarious. It's one of those shows that's fine for kids to watch, but it gives me an Adult Swim kind of vibe.
Keep him
Instant 5-star 
He's so polite
He has a quest for you
Reminds me of when I once was in Greece and a cat hopped on my chair and ate my stake when I was in the toilet. Good times.
What kind of cat is this
i love cats but not up close.
Cutie :) also what's the book on the table? It looks interesting
Unless you were at a cat Café, gross. 
Is that the waiter 
Litter paws
Nope outta there.  That's super unsanitary.  Imagine what the kitchen looks like. 
Hi there! I'm unhygienic and adorable
This wouldn't be allowed in Australia. Store would be closed by health inspector.
Probably a D rating restaurant 
How does this get 108k upvotes
Weird how these superuser accounts posts are so basic yet invariably receive hundreds of thousands of upvotes.
As much as I like cats this is disgusting. I wonder what this cafes hygiene rating is? 
You gotta buy him something now
Looks like you're about to have quite a fancy feast.
Excuse me sir, are you ready to order?
Damn cute kitty !! 
I think you've been joined by a suave gentleman! 
Please tell me that’s your waiter!😍
Was at a tire place last week and they have a dog and 2 cats that wander around.  One of them was in a lady's lap, getting petted and apparently refused to move.
What an adorable little face :)
Love this little guy’s big eyes 
I was expecting a bullshitting post from this Op.
Adorable.
"Feed me."
You have been chosen.
Well? Where’s his food?
He is sooo cute <3 Would drink coffee only to hang with this Cat :-D
Didnt even know it was shittymorph
Did he slam you into the announcer's table at hell in a cell?
Did you get a free meal? Or was the cat meal it’s own reward 
I can haz? 
I must admit, the OP username really caught my attention. 
He broke my heart 😊amazing kitty
"meow ya'll doin', enjoying everything alright?" 
I didn't know u/shittymorph did normal posts lol. I was a watching the cat expecting undertaker to throw mankind off hell in the cell lol
Knowing this I would never eat there. Cat hair must be every where.
r/thathappened
Hmmm. Thats a best friend for sure. Better nuzzle that lil shit before it gets away. Be safe and squeel at a high pitch when you do ut to prevent the spread of disease. 
Puss in boots? 
\*\*CRACK\*\* Not on the table.
I'm not reading any lengthy comment here before reading the last sentance. Too dangerous. 
did you feed the cat? every time an animal comes near me and I have food I have to feed them.
“Welcome hooman swave person”
It looks like a Pokémon 
Does this small cafe serve a lot of chicken that taste a little tough? 🤷‍♂️
You do realize his little butthole is touching the table... it’s what cats do best.
Naww
He’s cute but no cats on the table when we’re eating. 
I'm not a party popper but as someone who's deathly allergic to cat dander this would make me flip the fack out. 
pat his head 😡
We need more cat cafes.
I’m sure the health man wouldn’t be happy 
His ass is where the shared app goes.
Awww...sprays with bottle. 
I would not eat breakfast if I had a cat on the table...unless you want toxoplasmosis
Those eyes...
[deleted]
Omg😍
Omg kitty!! 
He looks so polite and friendly 
Where is this cafe so I can visit?!?!?!
Even the health department couldn't get mad over this.
Aww
Is this Istanbul tho
Ewww how gross and unhygienic 
The cafe should be shut down for unhygienic practices.  They should know better than to let stray cats roam through there kitchen 
Rip off the collar and you've got yourself a new cat.
Soft 
That’s kind of gross to be honest. I’d never let an animal on my table where food sits.
[deleted]
Is this cafe possibly in Dixon Montana?
It’s bum is on your eating surface.
Hope he didn't bring you some Almond Roca...from his kitty box...you know...
Check for lipstick
Who the fuck gilded this
Good god the r/DisneyEyes !
r/disneyeyes
Adorable but grooooossssssssss
Yuck
That's a cute kitty but that sounds really gross to me. I don't really understand the appeal with places like that (if you're actually planning on eating or drinking) but I suppose it's a good thing that those places exist for others to enjoy.
Why the fuck does this post have so many upvotes? I love shittymorph just as much as the next guy, but this is insane.
Gross. Sorry.
Super sanitary 
Very cute. Not sure I'm a fan of a cat's balloon knot on my eating space however. Those eyes though ....
bot post
What's his name? Please say the undertaker
Gross... Hope you like toxoplasmosis for breakfast... 
as a cafe manager, who also owns two cats and a dog (who stay at home), takes every precaution to make sure i arrive to work with zero pet hairs on me, even brushing and tying up my own hair before putting on my work clothes, this really baffles me. Cute kitty though.
Stupid thing looks like if a fur ball was an animate object, was able to take a shit
Hellooooo
