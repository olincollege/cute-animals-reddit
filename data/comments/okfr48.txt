Idk why I processed this as the dog becoming that at one week old. I need more sleep
He loves you even with your new hernia.
Hold him tight. Love him and enjoy every minute with him. 
We had to say goodbye to our little girl last night. And it hurts so much. 
Love him with all your heart.
"Human is picking me up! Human loves me. I am still the baby."--- this dog

100% get dog insurance! All 3 of my pitties needed to get ACLs repaired (a $3k+ surgery)
Thank you for not cutting his ears or tail, I hate it when owners do that to their dogs just because ‚Äúit looks good‚Äù
You're his little guy now.
Oh he still cute now, but goodness he was the sweetest little bean as a pup.
That dog looks like he's trying to say yes I'm still a puppy.
And now... he's a moose!
im sorry to tell you, but I dont think he is little anymore :(
Not sure how to tell you this, but he is no longer little. Yet he is, in no uncertain terms, a very good boi.
What a lad
They‚Äôll always be small. No matter how much they grow.
You look a lot older than 1 bro
You're going to need a bigger house
He is no longer a Good Boy, he's now a Good Man.
Looks like my Good Boy! Mines only 6 months! There's no Love like a Pit bull Love
This post brings me joy, I like this.
Kind of looks like me pre-lockdown vs post-lockdown
Does he knows that he is a good boy?
I love the change in expression from super serious as a tiny thing, to the goofiest smile as a giant.
Happy to see natural ears and tail!
***THAT*** happened in a week?!
He‚Äôs clearly a very happy, healthy pupper. You guys are great together! Thanks for being such a good dog dad!
So cute! My ‚Äúlittle‚Äù girl has very similar markings and likes to be cuddled like this too üòÇ
So is it a...package deal?
Can we talk about that glorious hair? Damn.
1 week?!  
Glad i have a shih-tsu, i have him for 2 years and the only thing that changed is the nails lmao
Side note u got some fire locs bro
i like your hair <3
Isn't it mind blowing they started out so small! 
...I mean my nephew is taller then me now, but that took 14 years. 
Little baby puppers did that in a year! Lol. 
I lost my big ol' boy last year...but I still have my little girl, she's a Chihuahua though...not getting any bigger that one. It's an adjustment from big mellow dog to tiny yippy dog. 
Dogs are just great.
Great photo, Bro.

I have six dogs and love them so much.  They are my kids.  Who doesn't love their kids?
Definitely not a little guy anymore. Good lookin fella you got.
He is beautiful. Ever notice big old babies like him, think they're 20 pound lap puppies?
Good thing you continued to lift, my dude. That's a beast of a beautiful dog
Why do we work out men? So we can pick up every dog we see.
His head looks like Scrappy Doo from the live action Scooby Doo movie
That's 1 year of growth!? That's crazy! What a cutie
HE‚ÄôS HUGE
This photo brings a big smile to my face. I'm halfway surprised a dog that big lets anybody pick him up though. My dog (about 65lbs) hated when people lifted him off the ground.
Still daddy's baby! Happy Birthday lil guy!!
He was a cute puppy; now a handsome dog. Thanks for sharing. I can‚Äôt believe how big they get in a year! Looks like he is a great dog.
Bro why'd you get so much smaller. It makes that lil pupper look huge.
If that‚Äôs a little guy I‚Äôd hate to see a big guy
He looks a lot older than 1, he looks like a fully grown man!

Oh you meant the dog
It wasn‚Äôt just the dog that got big. My guy got swole
Cute pupper for sure, but can we talk about your hair and your eyes and your smile?! ü•∞
Aw I love him. And your hair is awesome!
My focus is totally on your hairstyle üòâ
It‚Äôs so adorable how pets can grow so large in merely a year.
probably the best pic i have seen today
Imagine how strong you would be if you had taken him up the mountain and sang while he drank
Both of you are handsome chaps
That dog is made of fur and love
I love how happy you both look! :3
I read the title three times as ‚ÄúMy little guy turned 1 week‚Äù

I thought you had found a real life Clifford the big red dog‚Ä¶. 

Turns out I just can‚Äôt read. Looks like a good doggo. Give him some pets from me for his birthday!
It‚Äôs like taking a mega mushroom
Am I the only one loving OP‚Äôs hair as well as the before pic of the puppy?
Big, handsome fella! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Little?
He isn't a little guy anymore he is a big boi
You bulked up in 1 year
He‚Äôs smiling! Way too adorable I love puppy glow up pics
extraordinary moment
my guy went from mini scooby to...scooby
Whoa
I want that dog, I don‚Äôt care what age it is, I want the dog
All that over a year? That‚Äôs crazy!
You're going to have to go see a chiropractor after picking that big boy up.
congratulations he's a beautiful puppy

Lol did you get bigger too?
I love this so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
What a handsome bug!
What a fucking hunk! Can't help but call blue noses hunks. Walk a bunch of them even the ones that were aggressive with others let's treated us walkers like family.
I love how dogs go from derpy minor to derpy major in just a few months.
 I accidentally read my little guy turned 1 week and was like how is that possible and then it was the Oh! Moment. Anyway, congratulations to you and your little-big guy.
Velvet hippo
And he‚Äôs still your Little Puppy Boy! And a handsome lad he is!
He‚Äôs so handsome! Happy birthday big guy!
May i ask what breed this is?? Hes beautiful
Lil white tippy toes ü§ç
What are you feeding him? Holy kibble killer!
Most precious of boys! Please give him some ear skritches for me.
Wtf did you feed that thing, Miracle-Gro?
[deleted]
Pony boy! Your tuff tuff hair!
Still just a little baby!
I like your locks, how long have you had them? Are they difficult to maintain? Also doggo is super cuuuuute
Get out!  OMG That‚Äôs a lot of dog food.  He‚Äôs adorable.
Nice shorts.
he gained enough XP to evolve!
Impressive hair.
Thats so cute üòä
He is so sweet!
He‚Äôs gorgeous ‚ù§Ô∏è
He was such a sm√∂l lil bean üò≠

Gotta miss the puppy days.
Thank you for not cropping his ears.
Dog:
‚ÄúHehe, I still fit!‚Äù
"Wow, my human buddy is getting so small!  I am also very small, but I will protect!"
Pitbulls who are raised right really are just big goofy clowns that love to snuggle.
I love this!!  What a great dog and so much change in a year.  Did you expect him to get this big?
The pic on the right his face is like" oh plz don't drop me"
Holy shit you look exactly like my cousin..... except he doesnt have a doggo
The look on your (good) dogs face cracks me up!!!
Omg he looks so happy being held
Is there a tinytoabsoluteunit sub?
Bro your dreads are long af. I grew my for 3 years before cutting them and they barely got to my shoulders. You must have had those for a minute. üôèüèΩ
I think he likes you!
Fucking cuuuuuuuuuuuuuute!!!!!!
OMG he is huge! He's gorgeous and I can tell he's very much loved! He was such a tiny puppy!
The people in the comments here disappoint me.
It‚Äôs a good thing he is about the same size!!! It‚Äôs is good to get the smallest puppy you see so they don‚Äôt get too big. üòÇ
Aww!  He's so cute!
My dyslexic ass read this as ‚Äúmy little guy turned 1 week‚Äù and I was like ‚Äúsweet cuppin cakes!?!‚Äù
I read this as "Turned 1 week" at first and was very confused
Dude, please don‚Äôt drop me!!!
Wow first 1 year old I‚Äôve seen with a beard and dreads
What a big beautiful boy!
Big boi <3
Sweet precious baby
I read the title as saying that he *turned* one week. I was perplexed at first, to say the least. Lol
He looks like a happy boy. Good job, OP.
Your hair and dog are absolutely amazing!
You two look chill, I love it
Awwww he's still a puppy!! Puppy baby
How beautiful!!!üíú
Damn that‚Äôs quite some growth! Awesome
I was reading this as ‚Äúturned 1 week‚Äù thinking what kind of steroid cycle is this absolute unit on!
Bro! What did he eat a whole cow, lol.... He's looks so cuddly i wanna pet him.
U two are beautiful! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Much love üíò ‚ù§  so beautiful
What friendly looking beast
How old did your man bun turn?

Beautiful hound...
Oh he‚Äôs just a baby
1 what? 1 ton?ü§£

üíï in spades
Happy Cake Day Doggo...
He is gorgeous! Happy 1st birthday Little Guy!!! üéÇüéÇüéÇ
I love how he looks unsure in both pics
Love the dreads. I really want some, but my hair is pretty thin and straight so it hasn‚Äôt worked out the two times I‚Äôve tried.
Awesomeness
LOL. Little guy hey says.
I don't think he did
Hard to tell from the angle, but looks like you‚Äôve been hittin the weights my dude.  Congrats.
Damn you look rad
How did you get your hair to grow in reverse like that?
For a second, I read this as  it was his first week, I was super confused
They grow into their hair so fast
Everyday I fall more in love with the faces of pit bulls. From the square like head to the innocent eyes.
That dog food is definitely working!
That‚Äôs a lot of growing in one year!
Doggo got big!
[removed]
Big boy! üòÄ
They grow up too fast üò£
Big fluppy duppy
What a difference a year makes
Why you looking like a much less depressed version of the guy who lives across the street from me lol. Similar dog too.
r/velvethippos would love this!!
Awww. What a sweet baby. It‚Äôs amazing how much they can grow in a year. It‚Äôs obvious he is well loved. Good job, Fur Dad.
Oh Lord so wonderful!  Happy Birthday!!!!!!  :)
Beautiful facial structure on that boy. Nice big nasal cavities.
My pit bull puppy looks exactly the same!
How adorable! From teeny tortellini to giant calzone! And y‚Äôall even look alike! Same eye color? Happy birthday big guy! ü•≥
Omg please give him a hug from me. So cute!
Beautiful pupper, congratulations! My little guy was that age like 2 months ago, now he‚Äôs 9 years old. Cherish every moment, my brotha!
Such a cute baby and grew up to be so handsome
So cute üíõ Happy Birthday üéâ
Precious.
Bro, aweosome hair and adorable puppers!

You can see the puppy in his eyes and smile
Dude your hair looks awesome, just wanted to say this lol.
From Tiny Bean to Jacked and the Beanstalk
Damn exponential growth

How adorable. 

My pit is my baby. She is my confidant, my shoulder, my companion. I know I'll probably sound like 'one of those people', when I say that she is the queen. It's so much fun watching her learn my ways, and I learn hers. I honestly believe she understands when I talk to her, which I do all day long. I even sing to her. She knows the tune of a few songs I make up about her. She has her favorites. She may not know the actual words, but she knows the inflection and general sound of my voice and how that correlates with a reaction from her.

She is also my seizure dog. Tho she has had no formal training, she picked up on what may have scared her when I had my first one with her. I've read that epileptics exude a certain scent when having a seizure. I don't know. I have been told that right before a seizure my personality changes. Whatever it is, she can accurately predict most of my seizures. It's happened too many times to be coincidence. 

I wish you the very best days with your new companion.
I so love your doggy! You both are Handsome!
Bigger dogs faces when they're being held is so funnyüòÇ Happy birthday to your little guy!
Such a good boy! Still miss my little dude after 15 years. Dogs are really a gift! And sorry I just gotta say this as a straight man: your hair looks fucking awesome dude!
Wow, gotta thank Bean and his daddy and all the commenters here! I read every post, laughed, cried, was informed and educated on surgeries and pet insurance. As a rescuer for many years, I know we always see the tiny furbaby in the big grown up doggie (or kitty)! This entire posting is like the storybook of life with wonderful strangers sharing their hearts which are united by their love for and losses of sweet precious furbabies. God bless every one of you here and bless big lil Bean (and daddy Bean) whose adorableness opened this magical door! Thank you Schnoodle for immortalizing and verbally painting a picture of all of our hearts!üíóüíìüíï
I would lay down my fucking life for that puppy. Many happy returns to your very good boy!
I love the derpy pitbull face! It doesn‚Äôt matter how big they get they want all the love!
I love how confused big dogs are when you lift them up üëÄ
And still no haircut
He still thinks he‚Äôs little!
My goodness! He turned into a great big boy! And he looks great!
Dog gets bigger, hair gets small
Aw Happy birthday puppers! They grow up so fast don't they?! Whered the time go.  Hope u made a cake n had a birthday party! My Django is turning 1 on Aug 1st n we're having a puppy birthday party. üòÅ
Freaked for a sec cuz I read ‚Äòmy lil guy turned this in 1 week‚Äô ü§£ü§£
Bean still has the same smile.
You‚Äôre telling me that guy is one year old? He has a tattoo! That‚Äôs just irresponsible. His hair is great for a baby, though.
Best lap dog ever! Happy first Birthday
Those are the best pictures!!  Such happiness.

Yay! I also have a beautiful blue brindle bully
Nice puppy!!
What kind breed of dog is that?
Handsome fella
The comments about dog knee replacement had me dead. I‚Äôve had sharpei all my life, eye problems ear problems. But not in my 30 years have I seen a dog with fake knees. Then the knee braces just send me into a coma. Woooo, thank y‚Äôall for the laugh.
Holy moly congrats hope he has a long and happy life you and him both
Thats one gorgeous little guy you got there!
Your phone has changed dramatically
nice child
One what? One decade! oh how they grow
They grew up way to fast.
Love your little guy - and love your hair!
We rescued a 4 year old Pit this March. My wife calls him Coffee Bean and always asks me "I wonder how tiny this 90lb monster was when he was born", and I always show her pictures like this, and I'm on my way to show her this now.
He has a really nice coat, may I ask what breed is he?
They grow up so quickly.
For a 1 week dog, it sure is a big boi!
Offtopic but you do be having a haircut like the God Shiva.
Ah yes, little guy. Man still thinks hes a lap dog
They grow up so fast
Idk why but I read it as my little boy turns 1 week and I was like what breed is that, Jesus.
He‚Äôs a handsome boy

And the dog‚Äôs cute too ig

He went from a smol precious bean pupper to a big precious bean pupper
That face. 

All it says is ‚Äúdaddy can still hold me.‚Äù
the dog version of the fallouts universe "Born Ghouls", a minor adult, minadult.
I want to be held like that
Little guy is an understatement

Aw, beautiful Blue. Take good care of each other!
Awww! What a cutie patooti!!
I don't often gasp at baby photos but sweet baby Jesus he is CUTE ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I have an AmStaff/Ridgeback/?? mix who loved to be carried around for snugs and comfort when we adopted him at <2mo. The chillest, cuddliest puppy we'd ever seen, he'd stop mid zoomies to lay on me if I sat down. Now at 8mo he's tall enough to put his arms on my shoulders (I'm 5'2)... which he still does daily so I will pick him up and carry him around. Got a good Terror Squad lean from walking his big ass though, so it's a win/win
This is adorable. And also belongs on r/toughguysholdingpets
How quickly they grow.
My stupid brain read "My little guy after 1 week!". I was flabbergasted for a moment there.
Holy handsome! And not just the dog!
Please adopt, don‚Äôt buy!

Pitties are such snuggly dogs! I love those blockheads do much
Missed the word ‚Äúthis‚Äù and was like, what the heck have you been feeding him?!
Y'all both grew, handsome pup! I have a great dane/pitbull mix and he'll be 7 months next week. He's a huge, hyper baby. Gotta love the doggos.

God damnit, why did you get all the hair? Share some with the less fortunate of us...

I so wish pitbull was legal in my country, I love how they look. Also love the fact that you've not done anything with the ears or tail, I just think they look happier and friendlier with it. Pitbull would 100% be my choice if it was legal here, but I love my rottweiler as well.
With the man bun and all, I wouldn‚Äôt call you little
Date me
Your little guy didn‚Äôt grow half as much as you in that time.  Cool how you trained your hummam bemming to cuggle and snap at the same time.

Those dogs are annoying. Always jumping up on people and want to tug on everything all the time.
I hear they're dangerous dogs don't hold that killer by your throat, he might lick your face.
Your girlfriend is hot
You should have rescued!
We also need to see how much your dreds grew in comparison!!! üòÅ
