i wish i loved anything as much as dogs liked everything
I get like that around puppies too
*Everyone* loves puppies.
Oh there must be a video with sound of this out there somewhere. I need to hear the noises that dog is making. I need to see what happens next. Someone, somewhere, must have seen it.
I love how he just keeps looking up at his other human all like "you seeing this?!  You see what she got me?! OM freakin G, look what I got!!"
If only more people had the hearts of dogs.
This is almost exactly how my boy reacted when we brought my daughter home from the hospital. We'd had our dog around kids a lot and he's always been great with them. I suspect he knew I was pregnant because he got pretty clingy and snuggly for a few months there. When we finally brought her home it was like he was screaming "FINALLY!" And he was just so happy and excited. Kiddo is 4 months now and he's still in love with her. He'll come over and lick her hands-- she's getting to the point of wanting to touch different textures, so she gave her first pet the other day. He will, on occasion, very gently swipe her tiny baby socks right off her tiny baby feet,  but I'm so pleased with how good he is with her.
Heaven is full of Golden Retrievers. Change my mind.
Dogs, in general, are awesome. But Golden's are the most perfect motherfuckers to ever walk the earth.
The puppy is mellow compared to the excited doggo.
"Wait.. are you guys serious!? THANKS MUM AND DAD!"
Oh is he for me, can we keep him can we??? I'll be such a good boi!!! 😂
r/DGDAG
Did you know? When a dog exposes their belly they are displaying their submission. In this case the big guy is letting the little guy know that he shouldn't be feared and that they can be friends.
Such a precious moment. So great to see your pupper so happy to have a sibling! Adorable x 10000
Word of advise. Never ever introduce a new dog to your pets in your house. It’s much better to go to a neutral area. Dog park, friend’s house... sometimes even the sweetest dogs can be territorial.

Edit: Dudes, I am not saying this was a bad reaction. It was beautiful to watch. I am saying I’ve had to receive dogs at the shelter, because they’ve introduced their new puppy at a place that was not neutral and their sweet, gentle dog that has never ever even growl at strangers almost tried to eat it...
Moooooreeee!! it finished I haven’t finished!
Dogs are just so damn wholesome holy shit I can't contain myself rn
You juste made my day. Thanks
Theres a whole lot of tail waggin going on
SO CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUTE
I had to put down my 14 year old baby last night, but seeing this makes me feel a littler better.
Dogs are a treasure.
"Is he mine, Dad?! Can we keep him?! Can we keep him?!"
Adults being kids
I needed this today, thank you!
I’m just imaging this dog with the voice of Doug from “Up” and him saying “I love you”

Dog: I don't want a dog.

The dog when the family gets another dog:
“Wow! My replacement!”
The best present ever!
This is giving me happy tears...
Sweet angels
That’s the cutest thing ever.
"Wat? You got me a heckin friend to play with?!? I love you so muches! I'm gonna teach him all my favorite burying spots!!"
He can't wait to tell his new friend all the secret of the house, how to get humans food and when you should bark at the garbage workers
FOR ME? FOR ME? FOR MEEEEEE?  Oh, I'm going to be the best big brother boi ever!!!!!!
Which ones the puppy lol
That’s the sweetest thing.
When you train a dog to sit for a treat, you give that dog a way to say "I want that". This one sees the puppy and sits several times.
Lmao the puppy is completely unaware of the other dog
The dog: Can we keep them, can we keep them?!
This was the most perfect response to a puppy. Of course by a Golden Retriever!
Goldens are one of the friendliest dogs that I have ever known.
My heart 😭😭😭😭🥰🥰
## Big dog says:


“I think I’ll just die now.” 


*lays down*


“Nope, can’t die yet!! Squeee!! I love it!


*sniffs little dog’s bits*


“Just died”


*lays down*


“But, but, buuuuuuuuuut LOVE!”


“Dead”


*lays down*


“Nope!! Just gonna keep dying!”

This is just anyone’s response to seeing a puppy brought into the room

“I just met you and I love you”
SQUIRREL
“You got me a puppy!”
Dug?
It’s great to see his behavior of flopping over like that. He’s really welcoming the puppy to play and trying to show that he’s no threat as to not scare the baby too much.
Retrievers appear to immature as they age
Squirrel !!
Meet your replacement
What is this salty liquid in my eyes?

There's gonna be a lot of pee, poop and vomit in the house until the lil' one has settled in and learned the rules.

And after that, it'll be bliss.
This makes me wanna cry from joy.

Awww me hearts all melting!
This is so beautiful it hurst, saving and sharing, thank you for uploading this here! A blessed, magical Saturday to you all!
I cannot tell who's the puppy or the dog in this clip. 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I do believe if dogs were in charge of everything that we would have world peace.
After one year of adopting my first dog today I'm getting a second one and I have been really worried about it. I like to believe in signs and this being the very first post I see today and it made me feel so much better!
Why did they carry the pup in in a paper bag?
Aw
Entirely too adorable.
Goldens are a whole other kind of wonderful. So precious.
Adorable
That is so cute
I remember the first time seeing this video on INS, and followed this couple's account and kinda witnessed the two brothers growing up and welcoming their human brother to the world. Oh dear, so much loving stories.
The dog will definitely take good care of that pup!
no joke, as soon as I saw his head turn, I yelled out, "Squirrel!!"

Too adorable. need to punch something to feel like a man again.
That is a clever "Up" reference. I am happy to see that movie is still relevant!

Hello Sunny, this is your replacement.
I love how the dog is like "Fren? FREN! itsafrenitsafrenitsafren!"
Can someone explain why you have to put the puppy in a bag or box before introducing it to another dog on camera cot internet points?
and this is craaaazy
This is the purest thing I’ve ever seen.

I love this dog so much. <3
My golden did the opposite. She didn’t look at her new sister for the first couple of months and would leave the room every time she waddled in. Now they’re inseparable
I mean, the other day a complete stranger asked me to hold her baby, and that was definitely the highlight of my week.

I like to imagine the dad is giving him a pep talk of how to act at the beginning.

That’s in front of the humans only.
Happiness. Pure, innocent happiness.  Thanks for that.
Cuteness overload
I cannot wait to get my second dog. 3 more years.
The big pupper's inner monologue 

"Mom did we get a puppy!?!? Dad! I think we got a puppy!!! Omg we did, we got a puppy! LOOK IT HAS A  TAIL AND EVERYTHING! Omg omg omg!"
He doesn’t know it, but that’s his replacement
Imagine how excited you would be if you would get another one of your species to live with you
So all mammals love babies?
Dogs are a fickle being. I helped give berth to my Bernese Mountain Dog during an unplanned pregnancy and damn, Misty will follow me and understand my every command like its her f’ing job, after delivering those six pups. Dogs have an intricate social network when it comes to humans. I swear, Misty will follow me to the grave and not bat twice at staying for my service!
I love how excited golden get when they get a puppy. My dog would be so pissed if we just randomly brought home a puppy haha
That's a real good boy right there
MY HEART. Q_Q HE HAS A FRAAAAND
Cute
Classic Schmosby.
The older I get the more I'm starting to like goldens. They just seem like such a happy, gentle, loving breed.
This is how doggo i want
I love how the dog immediately rolled over to give the new puppy it's belly. "Look friend, I too am vulnerable now! No need for alarm!"
This is what I needed this morning
"OMG, I dint even know I was prego! "
Awwwww
Is there a good boy award 😭❤
I will watch this every morning and hope one day something will make me this happy! Would smoosh both those pups all day!
The happiness, the waggles, the restraint 10/10
Could you imagine? I’M NOT THE ONLY ONE!!!??? CAN IT STAY!? IM STILL THE GOODEST ONE RIGHT!?
The dog things the humans got them a puppy!
Dogs are angels
Even though this worked out, I strongly encourage those bringing new dogs together to do so in a neutral space.

How is that every golden retrievers in every gif and vids such an angels????
*catsarethebest452 has left the chat*
Crazy how dogs can love a new friend immediately but to introduce new cats you have to schedule an appointment with your existing cat 6 months in advance and have them pre-approve every hair that enters your house
Goldens are precious.  What a place the world would be if we could all behave like a golden retriever does.
 This is so damn cute. We need updates and sound!
Labs and retrieves are the fucking best.

Submissive dogs are the best.
What dog breed is that
#that wood stove is not installed to code and is a huge fire hazard
That puppy has no idea what's going on and is loving every second of it.
I wish my husky was like that towards the shephusky puppy we got. He beats the living shit out of her during playtime, and scared the piss out of her when they first met.
Are dogs actually happy when they see another puppy? I have read that tail waging is a sign of request for interaction. Could it be that the dog is jealous?
Happiest doggo ever. Freakin adorable.
What a repost.
That dog is better at communicating its feelings than me.
Definition of happiness right here
This is why dogs are the best people.

To be fair, that's pretty my exactly how I react when I see a puppy too.
"oooooooo I want you I don't know if I need you but ooooooooo I'm dying to find out!"
He literally cannot! Cuties, both of them. :)
When does he disembowel the puppy and rape its corpse
Now that’s just downright wholesome.
Soo adorable!
I just imagine the dog going:
"He dad! Look a mini me! I have always wanted a mini me! Ooooooo this is so exiting!"
"Did somebody order pizza with extra pupperoni??"

"Me, me, me!!!"
Classic Schmosby
When my older dog first saw our new puppy come through the door he took a massive shit on the carpet and hated him for years. Not until his last few months did they seem to get along
The way they introduced the puppy plays a big part in how it was received. Everyone should take note. Too many people complain their pet doesn’t accept a newcomer without questioning their own methods.
Goldens are such wholesome creatures.
Did.....did she carry that thing in a grocery bag? My local stores are severely under stocked.
What a well trained boy/girl.

Knows they are not the Alpha and welcomes the newcomer by showing their belly. Well done!! 

Great training by the humans and a great dog.
me in a nutshell tbh
This made my heart melt... thank you
OMG thank u for starting my day this way👍👍👍❤️
I love when people get their dog a dog.
Kinda clingy no? Niceguy dog
Really makes me happy seeing how happy that good boi is to have his smol fren
So precious
Heckin excite
It’s like the bigger doggie is saying “Can you please just go ahead and marry us right now?”
The sad thing is you will never see a human act like this when he encounters a new friend.
I'd like to see the same video, but introducing a new cat to an older cat.
"Oh boy, you brought me dinner! Thank you, hooman!!!!"

Goldens are the best dogs. Fight me.
I love people who love their fur babies!❤️
You can’t convince me there is a cuter pup than a yellow lab or golden retriever. They define cuteness.
Is there a sub just about dogs getting dogs? These are the best videos and they make me so happy
big dog obsessing over small dog, small dog checking out girl, meanwhile dude is left alone :(
That’s a great dog right there, already teaching the new pup what good behavior looks like.

Old video. Inspired my Banana Repuplick joke.
Sometime, we really don't deserve dogs. They are too lovely and innocent.
Apparently the best way to introduce dogs is to take the older one out for a walk and fave the new dog inside when you come back.

/r/dogs_getting_dogs
people, if you plan to do something like this, dont be too protective especially when your older dog is as sumissive as this one. leave the puppy free, it will come back to you to seek cover if necessary and it will gain more confidence when you let him or her make their own decissions.
What a good boy!
Soo cute!!😍😍😍
Dang this is exactly what I need to see after a bender of a night
I wonder how this dog sees the world
This is SO cute!
He looks back at dad like "Can we keep him?!?"
My eyes are leaking for some reason
"can we keep him?"
Oh retrievers
"I just met you and I love you". That's Golden Retriver folks!
This is why dogs are better then cats
He reminds me the dog from Up
😍😍😍
Is this considered eye bleach ?
I hope he knows how to care for and clean up after one of those. It's a lifetime commitment
The big dog is just so full of love and eagerness to be friends that I burst out crying.
Amazing.  I love this video.  Simply awesome.  Whata Good boyyyyyy!!!
That’s awesome
That made me happy

That is a tiny dog, and a giant puppy...

Don't mind me, I'm just here for SchoodleDoodleDo
Golden retrievers are THE BEST family dogs. Adorable goobers that they are
My older dog really did not like my new puppy when we first got her. She’d cower from the puppy, run away when we tried to socialize them, and bark at the puppy when the puppy came near. Now they’re literally inseparable.

Fuckin’ goofballs...
Why do I keep on finding posts that make me want to have my own golden again 😥

This made my whole day
Omg the rolling over! "I'm not a threat, I'm a big friend!" 😭😭
What a good boy
And my heart grew 3 sizes today...
I love how the doggo is looking to the owner constantly like "can we keep it? Can we keep it?!"
AWWW KEEP US UPDATED ON THEIR FRIENDSHIP
Man I wish my dog would do that.  He's like the psycho boyfriend that announces to the entire bar not to stare at his gf, when nobody was.
I wish just once, someone would be that happy to see me.
Too cute for words.🤗
So fucking adorable
i have Goldens and introductions never went this smooth. My sweeeeeeeet Goldens would turn into Cujo for about 5 weeks after the new one arrived...
Cats: take weeks to accustom to a new cat
Dogs: Hi! Hi! <Friends!>
“A little sister! Yesyesyesyesyes!”
We got a puppy!?!
I tried this method introducing my adopted kitten to my adult cat...didn’t work so well. Cat instantly attacked and kitten pooped in his box out of fear.
YOU GOT ME A PUPPY?!!!!
New best fren!
I like how the dog was trying to contain its excitement in order to not scare or hurt the puppy by accident.
Aww what a sweet boy.  Little does he know, his new buddy is going to start stealing his bed, his cookies, his toys...
im more impressed they have a steam powered TV ;)
This is way up there for cutest thing I have ever seen in my entire life
I have watch this like ten times and my heart is melting 😍
I’m being watched. Act normal.
I’ve been wanting a dog for so long so but current apartment complex won’t allow them, after seeing this video I’m going to get a dog and live out of my car
I wished this veido went on forever
Always wondered if they ever figure out they are on the way out and that’s why a new one is on the way in. If they don’t, that’s actually the best life.
WE GOT A PUPPY! MOM! LOOK! ITS A PUPPY! IT LOOKS LIKE ME! *Happiness noises*
He was wishing for a puppy for years
It's funny how different this is to introducing cats - where they need to be separated for a few days and only be allowed supervised interaction for a while until it's clear that they won't go after each other..
I love how dogs circle around 1 spot. And this blonde beauty stops, looks to his owner for confirmation & barks, then lies upside down to be nonthreatening & welcoming
What did we do to deserve dogs 💙
THEY’RE GOING TO BE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS! Or maybe already are, I don’t know how old this is. Haha either way, I love it!

People who have introduced a new member, what determines that your older pet does not act like an asshole to the new one? Some years ago I tried to introduce a new kitten to my kitten... Shit got so wrong. They never recovered. They are both assholes to each other and me.
What is on her forehead?

And if it had gone wrong, there would still be r/AnimalsBeingJerks to post it in.
That's the problem with goldens. Their baseline is overjoyed, so if something actually great happens (like getting a *puppy!*), they don't even know what to do with themselves. Sad really.

/s
Supercute!!

What shelter did you rescue the little one from??
I find this strange, even with the aww value. This is the replacement dog. Same copy, nearly identical temperament. Kind of an odd tradition in my opinion. Down vote me...
