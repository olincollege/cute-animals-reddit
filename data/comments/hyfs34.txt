Old dogs are the best.  Gone are the days of training and having your shoes chewed.  Now they are just your very best friends!
Reminds me of Shadow from Homeward Bound
Ugh this hurts my heart. I constantly think about the day when my dog gets to be this old. He’s the best pal I’ve ever had and to watch him get old and pass .............. damn.
Cute.  Those buddies for sure have had some adventures together.
Hello, if you haven't already; glucosamine (I get generic tablets from the 99c store) is a godsend for dog arthritis. I had a 19yo chow mix who could barely get up from the ground if we missed a dose (crushed and mixed with his meals)

There's a dosage for weight online somewhere
I want them to live forever. Such sweet babies!
The corgi is like:  what do you mean, speed up?  This is top speed!
The tails waggin! So fricken cute
Remember, a dog is just a few years of your life, but you are their entire life. Cherish it.
Sweet bronco , and ol pups !
Technically they are ambling.  This video shows all the methods of walking for four legged animals.

old dog Zoomies!
Old dogs really touch my heart. My Lucy Fur is 16, mostly blind, somewhat deaf, a bit stiff & slow, but still as happy & silly as when she was a puppy. She’s always so happy to see me. She searches the house for me with her limited vision. It’s hard knowing our time together is coming to an end, but I know she’ll be at peace & free of pain & blindness. I’ll mourn & remember her always. Someday when I’m ready I’ll bring home a new puppy to love. 

  I imagine wherever we go after we die as a place where all the dogs I ever had will come bounding towards me, young again, attacking me with kisses. I’m reminded of a quote by Stephen King, “A man’s life was 5 dogs long, Cortland believed. The first was the one that taught you. The second was the one you taught. The third & fourth were the ones you worked. The last was the one that outlived you. That was the winter dog.”
Awwww.
i know the focus is the dogs but id love that bronco in the background
Both the best of good boys
Def trying his best
How can something be heart warming and heart breaking at the same time?
Don’t make them walk! Go to them!
Before I read the title, I just thought the golden was making fun of the others short legs.
Ohhh dat Bronco.
Hold your horses there you young whippersnapper we are getting there
Watching them brings joy and warmth to my heart... always loved dogs even though i'm a muslim and can't have one as pet.. but to me, dogs are great companions... my favorite is the golden retriever.. beautiful creature..😊😊
This hit all the feels. I had to put my 13.5 yr old sheltie down Friday.
It’s a crime that dogs don’t live longer. They are so loyal even when we don’t deserve their loyalty.
OMG, this makes me smile and breaks my fucking heart, all at the same time. We don’t deserve dogs. 💕💕💕
This video is just so pure 😍😭
He’s in pain
This is too sweet. Old dogs are the best.
Old dogs are best dog.
The stiffness makes me so sad. I experience hip and leg stiffness. 
 
They deserve ALL THE MEMORY FOAM.
Can’t take my eyes off that beautiful Bronco in the back. 86?
Get those puppers some glucosamine treats and cbd oil! Works wonders!
Old dogs are the literal best. I miss my old girl so much. Give these sweet old men an extra hug from me.
Tail's still wagging!
My Mocha is 17 years old
Looks like they're about as well-traveled as your Bronco. You like to keep nice things running.
someone reach out to this guy and tell him to give his dogs some CBD oil or CBD treats…and for everyone else with dogs that are older, take advantage of what CBD has to offer.
Poor baby looks like he's in pain.
Paging u/wannabe_naiad these are their precious babies. I imagine they would appreciate credit for the video as well.
All these people talking about these dogs should be put down... that weirds me out. These dogs look super happy! So what if they’re old and hobbly! They aren’t whimpering or wincing in pain. If they were in pain and couldn’t walk, they’d be resisting, not enthusiastically doing the old dog trot to greet their human who they obviously adore. Dogs don’t need to be euthanized just because they’re old...
today i had to put steps to my bed for my old dog to be able to get up because he can’t jump anymore. :(  
i just wanted to share with someone.
Awwww best kind of pups ❤️😷🇨🇦
This makes me both sad and happy
🐾❤️😍❤️🐾
I have a soft spot in my heart for old dogs.
Heartwarming 💗
Aww nice to see
My heart ❤️
Omg those precious babies!!! 😭😭😭
Elder doggo is just as cute as his younger pupper counterpart
Man I bet they have some wild stories about those good ole days..... 13/10 would scratch
My heart just got poked. ♥️♥️♥️
The best boys.
The very bestest bois!
Aww this is awesome. Such a change from the typical happy dog clip
Damn, this hits hard. One of my St. Bernard's is 8 and is having issues walking. He's not overweight but the vet think he pinched a nerve in his neck. I fear the day will come soon that we will have to put him down. I'm 38 and we got him when my Wife and I married. I'm not ashamed to say I'm going to be a total wreck when it's time to say goodbye. Man i'm literally crying typing this.
Hope they aren't in pain
That's how I look every morning getting out of bed to go pee
Full trottle
Awww 🥰
Oh my heart I just lost my elderly dog yesterday (she was 15) and it's been so so hard
That dog could use cbd. Works great for my girlfriends 15 year old dog. So much more active since starting it a year ago
"I heard you paint houses"
Revvin' up the ol' engine to get to cruising speed
Pets may only be a fraction of our lives but for them, we are the family for their whole lives.
This is one gif I’m happy that ended too soon, because it meant that the owner put down their phone to snuggle them both.
My boy just passed unexpectedly at 9. I would give anything and everything to see him so old and slow
Those gentlemen need cuddles NOW!
When my dog was 19, she would sleep for most of the day. But when we got home, she would always make the effort to get up and trot towards the door to say hello
Why is it so saddening to watch this?
I only see puppers.
Omg!😢😢❤️❤️
I get a real Al Pacino and Joe Pesci vibe from these two.
This is so wholesome and sad at the same time...
Anyone else love his friend trotting along with him not too fast or too slow
So this is what crying while when your heart is full feels like.
Upvote for good doggos!
Remind me of our dog, sad to see them struggle.
Please play AC/DC “Back in Black” with slow walk.
Did someone order meloxicam?
I look at this videos and realize that the world isn’t that bad in this moment
Wise elder boyos
Oh my heart.
I just imagine the dog thinking "time to retrieve those head rubs"
My mom’s favorite dog of all time was a German Shepherd that she found after a hurricane, covered in cigarette burns. She rescued him as a puppy and he was super loyal and sweet. As he got older he got hip dysplasia which is super common amongst shepherds. He got to the point where he couldn’t really use his back legs anymore. So they adopted a 1 year old black lab who was super hyper. Suddenly, the shepherd was able to use his back legs and that dog probably got 3 more years of life thanks to that little puppy.
probably in pain but still wagging and smiling, we don’t deserve them
My dog just died today and this makes me miss them
I think if my cat ever got this old i would give it a cat cane so it can nice and slowly and old like
Oh man. I just had to put down my old boy tonight. This hurt
No country for old dog.
Few things are more rewarding than giving back the love to an old dog that they spent a lifetime giving you.    Old dogs are the angels we don't deserve.
"Oh, Peter. I've missed you so much."
Saved a post so I could take the same meds old dogs take.
If they were your grandparents, one of them would have had a tray of fresh baked cookies for you
“Say bill, you hear about that new chew toy coming out?”

“Eeeeh dagnabbit all them advanced toys ain’t nothing like the tennis ball I had as a young pup.”
If  the owner hasn't already these dogs should visit a vet. Dogs can get injections that help with arthritis if that is what this is.
Get those old bois some CBD!
Both of them suffer on severe arthritis, and have a kind human who makes them to forget their pain while walking. <3
OMG words cannot express how cute this is
Christ video guy, WALK CLOSER TO THE DOGGOS. Don’t make the old boys/girls walk to you!
The unconditional and undeniable adoration makes me simultaneously happy and sad cry. Reminds me of my pup, he’s 14 now, he’s blind and going deaf. When we go outside I clap continuously and talk/yell encouraging things to keep him active. Some days he still trots around (tentatively) but he loves it.
Shadow, you're back! I thought you were too old.
Aw!  This reminds me of my two old pups.  My one has ACL problems in both back legs and my other one has back problems but they still hobble and greet us every time we come home.
Go to them, FFS.
my childhood dogs made it to that age and stage. it was really rough. really really rough. i watched one die of natural causes, it was so hard to watch. for an entire day we just sat there and watched her struggle to breathe, waiting for her to take her final breath. she was in love with my mom primarily and at one point my mom went inside to get some water. 

she almost stopped breathing while i was holding her and i wanted to yell for my mom to come back out but i didn't want to scare her either. so i just held her and she breathed twice more, at which time my mom came back and i handed our old lady back to my mom. and then our old lady took her last breath. she waited for mom to come back. it was heartbreaking.

i love you old lady.
Those are dogs. Fucking 12 year old speak.
So cute. Old dogs are great, but everyone here needs to recognize the point when keeping them alive any longer is only in YOUR best interest and not theirs. Being able to have the compassion for your friend to know when the days hurt too much that it’s time to let them go. Putting a pet down is unbelievably difficult, but making them free of pain is important.
Surely that dog's walking that way because any other way hurts? At a certain point isn't it kinder to put them down?
I don't love this or find it particularly cute or adorable... They look like they're in so much pain, what quality of life is this?
this is animals suffering, not cute.
Fake! Who the hells owns such a well kept Bronco!?
I have a rock out side that says to my dogs it’s infrared says if tears could build a stairway, and memories a lane, I would right up to heaven and bring you home again
they will do this until their last breaths
Bro give them CBD
[removed]
How old?
Exquisite beauty !
Truest of loves.
Oh my goodness! 😍 Sweet babes.
awww <3 such good bois!!
Those are some good old babies.
Yeah buddy!  Where we going?  Doesn’t matter, over here!
😭😭❤️❤️
Good dogs!
AWWWWW
This is the best thing I have seen in quite some time. Thank you.
He has a spring in his stagger
Awww! They always go that extra mile to show their love.
the tail still works perfectly, look at it go!!!
God I love animals...they are walking LOVE.
They old but they gold
Ima need this slowed down x10 so I can get a good look at old boy
Sweethearts!
Aged like fine wines.
Oh my ❤️
I just realized I've never seen an old corgi untill now.
This needs to be at the top on popular ! Oh my goshhhhhh so sweet
Always upvote old doggies.
Good dogs
Had a bad day. I needed this...more than I knew.
Aww so cute...
This makes me miss my old golden, such a great dog losing her was the worst.
My 4 yr old golden retriever already has bad hips, she can't even jump
Slow bois roll out!
SUCH GOOD BOYS
They're still so excited !!!
Sweethearts
I'm not crying , you are
Why did I hear Ol' Man River in my head?
The wholesome content I need in my life :D
My dog has gradually been losing the ability to walk. Until about a month ago he could no longer stand up. It's pretty painful to watch him like that.


My father refuses to put him to sleep, so this is harder for me. He says that as long as he desires to eat he is okay. About 5 days ago he started refusing his dinner and we have to force him to eat. 

He says that he is still okay. Please, I would appreciate tips to convince my father that our dog needs to rest.
man. that punch is gonna hurt harder then a punch from mike tyson when these good doggos head on home. i hope the owner hangs in there.
Goodest doggos
That’s so sad 😞 getting to that point where you may want to euthanize etc I work with dogs and a dog that stiff definitely has some sort of arthritis etc definitely in pain. Makes me sad
I hope they get cbd for their joints
Great dogs! But can we talk about that Bronco?
The Golden looks at the smaller one and decides he’s going to step it up, because he wants to be first for some pets and belly rubs - remember that a dog’s human is everything to him
My old doggo walks just like them 💖
That’s enough to make a grown man cry mother of god mah heart
We do not, I REPEAT, we DO NOT DESERVE DOGS!
So cute ♥️
Am I the only one wondering why the cameraperson isn't moving towards the dogs?
Oh, so sweet.
Awwwwww
I'm not even going to dig through these comments. It's just going to make me sad.
Aww. I love your puppers.  They are sooooo beautiful. 🥰❤🥰❤🥰❤
So sweet!!!
Beautiful old dogs
😭😭😭😭
Well it is just natural :). Just pet him :))
Awww man, their poor arthritic little legs!
Dogs really are the best.  The realest teachers and friends even when gone.
The goodest boys
Still so excited to get there fast.
this thread made me cry goddamn it i hate you all
I wanna cry they make me so happy!
I can hear them going “The old boy/girl is back. We gotta help ‘em in the house “
Slow Zoomies. Slowmies.
I want that bronco
r/seimooZ
Good dogos
Precious 🥺
Aww
The big doggo may not walk the same in their old age, but that tail still wags like a pup.
I love them both! Look how happy they are to see their owner
meet them half way 🥺🥺 save those precious limbs.
I cried at this I don’t want my pup to ever die.
My old lady dog has the same gait.  You know their heart is still in it, but the body just can't run anymore.
I've never seen an old corgi before now. 

This happiness hurts
I just love the title of this post
I hope to god they got a treat for that workout! Badass bronco by the way..
Riiiiigs. I'm getting too old for this shit.
Well, this made me cry! So adorable and so sad at the same time. Mine is walking slower and slower these days :’(
They're hecka old, but they still living their best life.
umesh
Oof, my heart! Their bodies have gotten slower and might be a bit sore, but you can see they both are still very much puppies in spirit. I love them so much.
❤️❤️❤️❤️
My last two dogs, a golden and a corgi.  This is painful but in a sweet way.

Best dogs a person could ever hope for.
You can see in their faces that they're just as excited as ever to see their owner 😍 ugh animals are too perfect.
This warms my heart
SO PURE
That corgi just.... hmm, big boned!
\*good boys snapping\*
They may be slow but those tails are a-waggin'! Still so much love in those two.
I said “oh no” out loud - because I knew I was going to cry - and my dog came up to me. I’m going to give him the biggest hug.
Old doggos are the best.  Love hanging out and watching the "game" with mine.
Has your vet suggested helps for arthritic joints?
Kings stay Kings.
I believe you can give them steroids for their joints, just wanted to say.
I love them. 🥰
Oh my goodness, my heart 😍🥰❤️ Older doggos are the best!
Sweet babies
Pls put this on r/masterreturns
I swear dogs are the best companions anyone can have!!!
Is the golden retrievers leg bleeding?
lovely  doggos
give them some omega 3 for their joints!!
this is not aww, look at them, you should go to them instead. smh
This makes me simultaneously happy and sad
/r/OldManDog
So sad. Bless them .
Brb gonna go squeeze my young/energetic dog and cry about his ultimate demise
That is both happy and sad at the same time.
Most of the dogs I care for(and my own) are seniors and I love seeing how they often still act like puppies no matter how old and stiff-legged these babes get
The Golden walks really odd. I saw older dogs before, they didn't seem to have problems like that. Is it some sort of an illness, or do they all get like this when they're older?
Old d0rgs are the best d0rgs
How sweet!
Then he waddled away, waddle waddle, to the very next day bum bum bum bum bum ba dum
Slow and steady wins the race
Golden always first for the pets. Their biggest motivation thru life. Furry saints.
This reminds me so much of my old husky, Patrick. He lived to 18. When he was young he would get out of the yard and run and stop just long enough for you to get close. Then he would run again. When he was 17 and 18, he wasn't moving very fast, but if I left the door open he would still try to make a run for it at about this speed. I would let him go for awhile and then turn back. He was the best boy.
honestly what is better than dogs?
A tear of joy came out my eye ❤
Love this
Just as happy as DAY 1. God I love doggos!
Sweet babies
Our families last dog would match my dads slow walk when they went out together. It was so sweet to see them slowly walking around the property together. I miss that dog.
I love the old, sweet, wise  puppers!! ❤❤❤
Loved it when one made the extra push at the end to get their faster. I'm not a dog person, but can appreciate the loyalty and love dogs have for their humans. Major feels.
I LOVE OLD DOGS. There, I said it. It feels good to get that out
Little arthritis boi 💖
Aww...such good hearts!  Big hugs for these sweeties!
Oh my heart!
They were once puppies. Time comes for us all.
Oh my goodness. My heart is absolutely melting over this. The sweetest thing ever.
Stiff boy
My pups, you trot to *no one*
TELL THEM I LOVE THEM!!! Such good boys! Give them extra pets from all of us.
I thINK YOU MISSPOKE THEY ARE JUST THE OLD BESTEST OF BOIS, LOOK AT THESE PUPPERINOS THEY'RE SO DAMN CUTE
i just lost my dog to old age so this made me both happy and sad
Just took my old doggo (14, lil pit bull) on a walk, thankfully he's still got some spunk but he definitely doesn't have the endurance like he used to. "Speak for yourself", said doggo.
Best boys.
Old bois
I want to take them for a nice gentle paddle.
Hey this is just a friendly reminder that glucosamine can be really good for dogs as they age and have joint issues. It can help with the inflammation and help increase mobility.
Old man doggos bought the farm 🎶


Oh no, no no nooo 🎶😖
i have such a soft spot for senior dogs
I thought this subreddit was supposed to make you go aww instead of crying
;; omfg I love me some old babies!!!!!
I love how the Golden looks over at the other dog, speeds up, and is thinking, “I can’t let Frank beat me to our hooman!”
I have a pup and 12 year old Golden, he walks the same way and drags his back paws. They are always so happy.
The very best good boys
His heart is still all puppy
God bless these beautiful souls
I want to hug him. Old dogs rule!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Handsome doggos!!
*Doggos deserve to live so much longer than they do.*
Why can i comment on this but not other posts, do i have to join a community to comment?
The golden said “no way I’m letting Jerry beat me”
Eh, where’s their bus passes?!
Yeah my old bestfriend couldn't get up suddenly one day so i thought she was just having trouble but when i got her up she just kinda keeled over took her in and found out she's got liquid in her organs and she's going to die so we had to peacefully put her to sleep so she didn't suffocate.
The saddest part is I saw this video a very long time ago originally so most likely they’re trotting in a better place
Wat r those things I honestly don’t knoe
GGGGGGGOD MY HEART ❤️
he's a super good boy.  i wish him the best
Beautiful amazing creatures, we as humans do not deserve them.
Aww dogs really are the bestfriends we couldn't ask for
So cute
Awww so cute!
*sniff
True love at its finest.
What happened to there old owner
Slow down old timers! Don’t be breaking any hips.
So sweet.
My old doggo is 1. He is becoming wobbly too.
Its impossible for me to not upvote these old dog pics and videos. I think my upvote rate is 100%.
I see some tippy taps at the end there! Adorable
What good boys
They deserve pets and treats
Please get these dogs on glucosamine/chondroitin.  It’ll change their lives and yours. They don’t even have to be old to give it to them. My Rottweiler/GSD mix Kyla was diagnosed with hip dysplasia when she was 4. I started her on glucosamine and she was getting up and moving when she was 14. My GSD mix Dodge is 13 he doesn’t get around like he used to, but it would be way worse if I didn’t have him on glucosamine.
Sweet babies
Beautiful old bois ❤️❤️
Get these poor dudes so rimadyl!
fug
Still rolling strong just like the bronco
[every dog owner thinks about it but Florida man took action.](https://themotherofallnerds.com/man-abducts-scientist-to-make-his-dog-immortal/)
I love them both so much.
Reminds me that my dog is 10 years old. I wish she was inmortal , god i love her
Oh my heart!
Dogs*
 Old dogs are LITERALLY the best, and you can't change my mind. My last dog died, and I'm so fucking glad we didn't listen to the vet who wanted to put her down.

 The vet said Not for her sake, but for ours.

 That really pissed me off, and yes it was annoying, and disgusting, but she lived a year. I remember playing ball with her before the last day, and taking a walk with her the last day. She was enjoying herself. She was a  stubborn rescue to begin with.

 Remember dogs want to leave to die alone. That's what I was told, anyway. She was very anxious and kept trying to get away the last night. Kept me up for hours, and my nephew found her dead. 

 I dug a six by three foot hole in two hours being so angry I didn't realize she was dying. I just wanted to get her laid so she could rest.

 I looked crazy crying shoveling like a mad man.

 Dogs are the best
Glucosamine for old pups makes a big difference in their step. They may walk stiff but they will definitely walk more on their own.
Awwww❤️❤️
It’s like their mind is already there and they are telling their body hurry up for fuck sakes!!! LMAO!!
This is nothing but wholesome! Love it!
Awwwwwww I want one!!!
I just want to pet them for hours and hours.
Cosequin DS will do wonders for dogs with arthritis and leg/hip problems. You can get it on Amazon. It’s added years to my little girl (chihuahua/schipperke mix). 15 and still going strong.
Fluffy Old Men
Holy crap that gives me the feels
That Bronco tho
I just lost the last of my three childhood dogs earlier this year. All three got to be this old. It's a sad thing, seeing them age so much quicker than you and moving on. From those three dogs I learned that there's just nothing you can do about it. The only thing you can do is make sure their short lives are well lived and filled with love.
Awwww..they are truly our best friends till the end.
I showed my boyfriend and now he’s crying. The retriever looks likes his old boy. We miss him 🥺🥺🥺
💓💓💓💓
It’s like the dog version or the last season of True Detective.
Too awesome.
AWWW THAT RUN AT THE ENDEDDD
❤❤❤❤😘😘😘
💙💙💙
This comment section is making me cry... I lost my old girl Bailey back in 2015. I have another dog now, but I feel like I’m almost living in fear and anticipation with the day he will also leave me 😢
This makes me sad.
My heart😭🥺❤️❤️❤️❤️
They’re so happy.
r/gifsthatendtoosoon. I wanted to see some scritches!!
Aww those poor little things. This breaks my heart. I know it’s not supposed to make me sad but that poor dog look like she/he’s in pain.
I love them so much.
Just revamped the front and back yard. I feel exactly like this.
Wow. How old are they?
🥺my heart! They’re so precious
:)
Nice
r/mademesmile
Sweet babies
You’re not gonna beat me whippersnapper!
Their bodies may be aging but the excited tail waging doesn’t seem to stop!!
Awww
Heckin doggos hurr, hurr. Holy cringe

Ughh
love this
That's SO adorable! My heart 💕💕💕
still the happiest bois :(
r/eyebleach
I also have an old golden retriever that has started to have some struggle for walking. I'm curious, how old is yours, OP? Cheers.
So sweet. So loyal. I love dogs.
Making my way downtown...
I can relate and appreciate, got a 16-year old hound myself.
my bottom lip grew when i saw the old doggo waddle over his poor hips :'(
That's the cutest thing I've ever seen 😍
CBD for dogs works for real too. My Chihuahua was having some stiff joints and CBD drops cleared it right up. He's like a pup again!
Enthusiasm never ages. Especially for dogs...
Canine therapeutic massage. It’s like magic. The seniors are my faves. ❤️❤️
The Retriever still has the wag and swag of a pup.
[Doggo Dark Crystal](https://imgur.com/gallery/i3Cq7)
But did they have a farm?
Good geezers
Such good bois
is that hip dysplasia (from birth) or old age causing the stiff walk
This is a sweet video,  but the words 'doggo' and 'kiddo' have got to gogo.
Lol that’s so cute!!!
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen
I’d die for them.
I don't need another reason to love senior dogs.
I always question quality of life when they get like this. It’s something I’m going to have to battle soon with my boxer. Not looking forward to it.
It's hard, but you have to know when to say when, best of luck OP.
What an asshat. They look like that's painful as hell. I hope they make his old ass walk for no reason when he gets up there in years.
This is the best thing i have seen all day
They's zoomin'!
❤️❤️❤️😭
Why is this video in 4K?
We need to invent immortality but just for dogs
Awww
Sweet puppers
I am fucking first bitch!
I missed the up button 10 times.. But i wasnt gonna keep scrolling till i hit it! Those are some good doggos <3
Poor old dudes
Reminds me of my dog, just as fluffy and chonky. Ha arthritis in his back legs though. Don't think we will have him much longer unfortunately
My heart 💜😍😍😍
🥺😍
Come on Henry...gotta go out the old driveway again. Ok Sam.
My dog died about a month and a half ago from sudden kidney failure (we think). She was only six and I only had her for a few years. I miss her every single day.
I want nothing more than to flop on the ground in front and in between these two beautiful bastards for scritches
So friggin’  touching. Another example of that line I’ve seen  so many times here: We don’t deserve dogs
In this instance, though, this owner clearly does.

Take your time! It’s okay!!
It makes me smile because they still just want to be with their owner. Thanks for sharing
so cute omg ❤️
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Come here sonny lemme lick your hand!
No, You're crying 😭 lol. . .
Aww poor thing probably has arfritis.
Me running to my best friend when we’re staying in the same retirement home
I like this very much
Is that a Corgi mix on the right? I have a 13 y/o Corgi Shepherd mix who is suffering from arthritis-she really struggles. I’m giving her a vet prescribed glucosamine, nerve blocker & pain pill. She hates them, but they make a big difference. Love to your pups!
Man give them old boiz some baby aspirin.
"me first, me first!"
This kills me
I think for a moment I saw their former youth.
old dogs dont need new tricks, they just need to be themselves
They may be old! But they still have that pep in their step!
Why I am crying...
Have a 17 year old that is just starting to walk a little stiff.
:’) but also :’(
Good God that’s adorable! I have a soft spot in my heart for senior dogs. My parents’ pug in her golden years would just lay around and sleep all day but as soon as my dad got home she’d clamber down off the couch and hobble to him as fast as she could. She would bark until he sat down so she could lay in his lap. If my mom was sitting on the couch she would bark at her until my mom moved so that she and my dad could share “their” couch together. Always made me laugh. God I miss that ol’ girl.
My heart!
Oh my goodness. Those happy faces. ❤️❤️❤️
Oh man, that's tough, but we all have to keep moving, especially when we don't fee like it!
I have an old dog, she's been with us for over 15 years, you wouldn't imagine how loud I'm crying right now because of the video
Who’s cutting onions?
me and the boys in our 60’s
Reminds me of the newest jumunji movie lol
Makes me wanna go visit my senior dog 😭
Not gonna lie the first thing I noticed was that Bronco. Being a Michigan resident, ones that clean are exceedingly rare
Precious. They’re loyal to the end. ❣️
My old lady pup died a couple days ago. I'm gonna miss her hobble
This makes me so fucking sad :(
🥺 aaawwwwww
My great uncle who we refer to as just uncle got shut down for having a dog a year or two ago and upset him more than his usual less than optimal mood. 

A month ago a friend of his had to give away his dog as it's puppies were blocking him from eating, I dont agree with his decision to let him go but the dog was old and reined in and wouldn't cause much trouble to walk and play with and knew my uncle wanted a dog. He gave my uncle the dog who's name was Paddy and he's been super happy and has started walking more!

Oh yeah the dog is a Charles Spaniel.
I want to reach though my screen to pet these old souls
I wanna give them a nice long hug
They stiil love their owner just slower and i love them for it so much
😥
Oh my heart ❤️ what sweet babies! 

My English Mastiff is 7 years old and he sometimes has problems with the stairs & I get anxious that his quality of life is not what it used to be. I worry about him growing old and being too big for me to carry as he is bigger than me.
What kind of cats are they
This made me so happy but sad. We rescued a young Corgi a few years back and he has been through everything with us after 3 years - 4 moves, 2 new kids, multiple new homes, crazy work hours, new people, etc. 

Now he gets upset when he can’t sleep next to me and I give in almost every now when it’s time to sleep. Definitely the best dog I’ve ever had, beyond patient and friendly. 

I’m going to be an absolute baby when he passes.
over and over and never actually reach him.
Those poor back legs aren't bending at all :(
Kinda feel letting them walk that far might not be that fair to them. Maybe better to come to them? Mmm. Adorable, especially the Golden, who seems to be limping.
This is so wholesome. Needed this!
"You know man, as we're walking down this here drive way a thought just went through my mind."

"Whats that?"

"We're freaking old...."

"You can say that again. But hey, at least we've got our family to take care of us old farts."

"You're right. You've always known just what to say."
\*step step step step\* floof would like love
What going on with the big one's left leg? It looks bloody?
I love old puppers
Wholesome old bois~<3
Lovely
We must protect them at all costs
He looks just like my good boy 😭❤️
Can barely walk and I bet they'd still crawl through fire for us 😢❤🐾
Came here for the doggos, stayed for the Bronco
Oh, thats gonna be my girl in a few years...
Oh man, the poor boy must be really feeling pain on those legs.  Looks like some big licking stains on them.
They walk the way I do.
They look so old but happy
Please tell these wonderful gentlemen that I love them.
Aww :3
So loyal.
*sniffles*

You take all time you need, old man :).

Bless em
A happy cry to start my day.
Old doggos are the best kind of doggos because they just cuddle up with you on the couch fall asleep next to you. We had an old doggo when I was younger and we used to fall asleep together all the time, I was so sad when he died. We were going to get another one but then my little brother was born and he’s allergic to dogs so we couldn’t but I definitely plan to get one when I move out
I wonder what conversations between these two would be like
RUN TO THEM YOU SICK BASTARDO
He do the best step
doggo fot som good fite doggo finish som race
What’s up with all the sad posts recently?      
      
Fun fact; both of these dogs have since died.

Amazing moment! Do you see my negative karma? Most of it was just because I said I am against euthanasia to old pets, they sure deserve more care and attention, but they deserve to live untill the end of their lives, cause all their lives was to make our lives better! Long life to our pets!
u/TheToxicLogic, Curious as to why they are called 'old man' doggos? Are they male doggos? Do old men have a certain gait that old woman do not (and these doggos are mimicking that gait?). Just curious....
