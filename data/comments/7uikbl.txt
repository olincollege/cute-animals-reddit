"That's why her hair is so big, it's full of kittens"
My mom's cat used to do that would actually sleep in her hair at night. Then she cut her hair real short and the cat got super mad and started biting her every time my mom laid down and the cat couldn't curl up in her hair. Mom did grow her hair back out. 

So **that** is how the NSA gets all our mobile data! 


... Spy cats 


At first I thought it was gonna be a scary spider or something, but no! It's the world's cutest hair security guard. 
This is why you don't touch curly hair without permission, you might scare the kitten. Also, if you ask and they say no it's because the kitten isn't friendly.
The call is coming from inside the hair!
Met a girl with big frilly hair.  First time I'm over at her place, in the middle of conversation, a small furry head pokes out of her hair, sniffs, and disappears back.  I'm trying to figure out the best way to say "Um, do you know you have a rat in your hair?" and apparently my expression was showing it, because she broke into laughter and explained that her pet ratty loved to sit on her shoulders and pretty much spent all it's time there when she was home.
That's some master zooming
Purrfect camouflage.
For some reason I thought they were on an airplane and she sneaked the cat on. Lol. I need sleep.
Do you think she knows?
Just say the words " Ronaldo is better than Messi" and the cat will turn into a lion.

I've once seen my classmate go to school with a giant wasp clinging to the back of her curly hair (just like the gif but tied back)

I gaped as she went out of my sight and saw the wasp gone from her when I saw her again in class. It's the most bizarre thing to realise other living things could even stay on your hair. Gave me paranoia about insects sticking to my own hair for sure alright

She's hot. 
Everything in this gif is beyond cute
I was expecting an enormous spider and for her to freak out.

But that didn't happen. And this wasn't the wtf sub. Thankfully. I was on the edge of my seat waiting to get freaked out. 
This Predator has an unusual shoulder cannon.
HEY I HAVE THE SAME JERSEEEY :D
I said outloud to myself "oh my god it's a whole cat!" then spent the next five minutes wondering why I said a "whole" cat.
Japanese horror movie check....
I think it‚Äôs better to say that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs someone in your hair‚Äù.. or worse..
Seriously though that‚Äôs some great hair.
Putting a cat around your neck. I see you like to live dangerously...
Too cute.

Christ that's a cute kitty.
So I didn‚Äôt look at what subreddit this was and half expected something wtf. Pleasantly surprised 
Expected a danger noodle, got cute cate.

Kittens and fc barcelona, two things that are awesome. 
I love when my cats accidentally lick my hair and stop working.
I really am an idiot sometimes. I was first thinking "Oh man, a Qatar Airways shirt, that is really neat." It took me a while to remember football is a thing. And I'm a sports fan.

LOL this is really cute!
"I have hair if you have coin..."
Cue X-Files music.
Her hair reminds me of a warm, safe place where as a child i'd hide. 
aww
Kittens *love* to sleep on shoulders.  Purring the whole time, until they fall asleep....
Am I the only one who can't see anything? Because it's making me fustrated 

Edit: Oh it‚Äôs a video. My phone didn‚Äôt play it, it just showed a picture -.-
"Aye, got back, I didn't finish reading that article."

That‚Äôs supposed to be lower, much lower.
Hair kittens were a big problem in the 1970s and to a lesser extent, the 1980s. They'd hide in big hair and attempt to steal your food. 
Not where I thought that was going ...
The new ceiling cat.
I met a stray kitten once and hung out with her until she got a ride to Cat Haven. She was tiny and scared and hid in my hair as well. 
Strange place for a pussy
Cat Lice.  You need a special comb and shampoo to clear that up.
Damn girl you looking like a snack... the cat I mean.
Hooman, take away that camera
Aww my birdy would do that. Except she'd also chew on my hair and then start trying to climb up inside it. Due to also having curly hair this led to having to untangle my bird sometimes. 
AAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW
Now I want a hair kitten. Life is naught but struggle. 
now that is hide and seek

This kinda creeps me out. Maybe it‚Äôs because my hair is so thin, there is no way a cat can hide in it

Perfect camouflage. I thought the little one was just a curl in her hair. 
Omg! That naughty kitten ü§£
Dont blame the little guy her hair looks super warm! :)

Haha, I saw what I thought was a clump of hair stuck together with a fluid and then saw the cat. Talk about a shift in thinking.

Wait. When I watched it without looking at sub I saw a wasp. Then I looked at sub and watched it and saw a kitten. Wtf.

Thought I was on r/wtf for a moment and was expecting to see a spider. Pleasantly surprised to see a kitty
I looked at this the first time without reading the caption and just kept looking at how odd her chin is 
‚ÄúIt gives my hair extra volume‚Äù
She is Saving Kitten from cold. Its Nice
Wow! That is not what I first saw. I just saw her hair zooming in until I saw something small move which looked like a roach or lizard. Then I read a comment and watch again. Brain, you tricked me again.
Kneel, mongerls - The cat said.
Your kitten is adorable! You and your hair are gorgeous! 
Go to your local shelter to make your hair look fleeked as fuck
She's either trying to hold back a laugh because she is in on it, or because she thinks she said something funny.
My cats go crazy as soon as some hair get too close. How is this kitten staying still?
