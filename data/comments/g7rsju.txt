I can't say hello when I start an online meeting, because my pups assume I'm greeting someone who's IN the house and go apeshit. I hadn't thought about making a sign. Maybe I should make a sign.

But but...what if I see a squirrel...or think I see a squirrel...or there could be a squirrel and I just want to make sure..... what then?
This is so cute!  One of the positives that I've enjoyed in this whole mess, is hearing the background noises of life and home, coming through when I need to speak with a CSR or tech of some kind.  It humanizes all of us, and I swear I've been getting better outcomes!
Working from home has challenges and temptations for sure, but overall....a good thing!
They aren't barking, it is their *happiness noise* because mom is home all day long.
Now if I could just get across to my cat, "mum asleep" = "no meowing"
this picture screams Texas
Mom on no = phone bark
the golden rule
13/10 most attentive bois
That's a pretty good caricature of her. My version of myself would just be a  stick figure.
Boy on left is learning. Boy on right is... Skeptical
Bestest students ever!
"Okay, we still bark."
(Leans over) ‚Äúwe‚Äôve been here for two hours, I still don‚Äôt get it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think it says when she‚Äôs on the phone...bark louder?‚Äù
My Chihuahua mix lives with my mom, who works from home. When she has a conference call, she tells him "okay Floyd, I've got a call now". He gets up out of his spot, goes into her bedroom, and waits on her bed until she says "okay Floyd, I'm done!"

Dogs are the best!
Very attentive. Hook em!
It‚Äôs like in the Sims where you can ‚ÄúLecture about barking‚Äù. After a few lectures, they ‚Äúlearn not to bark‚Äù.
Does this lady work for NATO?
But...the mailman?? He is going to break in! Must protect!
No one is going to talk about that cool medallion built into the carpet?
That drawn mom face kind of haunts me. Like a particularly weird political cartoon.
For a second i thought it was Mr. Peanutbutter on the sign.
Those dogs are hopeless, they aren‚Äôt even looking at her sign!
Hook ‚Äòem!
Mom on No = Phone Bark
Dogs: ... so, bark?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but the folded American flag means it was given during a military or similar funeral? Or could it just have been folded that way...
Ahhh, the Boomer Armoire. The landfills will be full of them in the future when none of their kids were willing to take them.
MOM ON = NO

Dogs: "Yes, Mom, you have our attention." 

Also Dogs: "What's that thing on Mom's head? Idk, we should bark at it to warn her, and make it go away."
Been on so many video calls with clients and the best thing is when you see their pets or their family walk by. It's really a welcome sight hahaha
Dog reads as follows, "Mom on NO. Phone = BARK!"
Mom:Okay puppers, repeat after me...  
Mom: When mom  
Puppers: When mom  
Mom: Is on  
Puppers: Is on  
Mom: The phone  
Puppers: The phone  
Mom: NO barking  
Puppers: No barking.  
Mom:Okay, so When mom is on the phone, no barking

This is the whitest image ive ever seen
[The solution is this](https://youtu.be/uWUHkCgslNE) -> Nvidia just launched AI audio which has the best noise cancellation, goodbye dog bark, goodbye kids screaming, goodbye neighbor drilling and hammering. The person on the other end will only hear your voice. Its for the RTX cards but it also works on GTX  cards with a bit of fiddling.
If this works, let me know! Some neighbours around here could do with this!
There‚Äôs definitely a treat in one of those hands.
‚ÄúAh shit, I forgot to teach them how to read English. Now to devise a Pavlovian means of conveying an alphabet...‚Äù
So human can speak all day but dog can‚Äôt bark for 5 seconds
I couldn't teach it to my kids.

I have no problem with a cute woof in the background of a phone call
MOM ON NO, PHONE BARK
Dey protec, dey attac, and wen dey start da barks, mom will hafta call u bac.
The one on the right is like 'yes, alright, seems fair, keep going', and the one on the right looks like 'this is all too confusing, and I think she just wants me to bark, so I'm gonna bark now'
Its been a struggle getting my pups to realize when its quiet time cause mommy is working. I had to put a gate up because they would start playing in the office. So now that the gates up , both of them just stare at me an wine from the other side. Sooo NOW i brought their doggy beds into the office beside the desk an they couldn't be happier or more quiet lol
They‚Äôre both like, ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt get it‚Äù
woof woof meow woof woof meow woof woof meow woof woof meow woof woof meow
MOM ON> NO PHONE> BARK got it mommy
These dogs are more engaged in their lesson than 90% of my students.
Goldens. Just pet while on phone for silence.
so keep on barking? oh okay
Your mom is Steven Tyler
You have to be kidding. I have been climbing trees all over trying to find dog food. I know it‚Äôs out there some place.
Red neckerchief: I completely understand.

White collar: Sounds good, doesn't work.
But did it work? did they stop barking?
mom on = no  

phone = bark  

got it
I love how happy she is about instructing them
Dog food doesn't grow on trees, but bark does.
When ever my wife is in the phone my dogs want to outside in the yard.  Over the years they learned if they whine at the door and she is on the phone she will let them out quicker.
Mom on no phone bark
MOM ON = NO  
PHONE = BARK!
If she uses RTX Voice the barks would be filtered out without any problem
Might want to make a Paw-erPoint for this one.

Or does it? ü§î
I don‚Äôt own pets but these dogs look so damn amazingly adorable
What she needs to do is give them a quiet busy toy every time she puts on the headset so they learn headset=busy quiet time
The one of the left clearly thinks this is bullshit.
Love the bandanas! So cute!
lol . Do you cat one for cats that decide to yowl at 4am?
Is that Steven Tyler?
"mom"

Absolute cringe
Jokes on her, dogs can't see the useless red circle.
barking overloads the dogs Bluetooth headsets.
Those dogs are so well loved. You can see them in the framed photos.
Dogs can‚Äôt read

Edit: it‚Äôs a joke silly voters
Did they learn, though?
Who is that picture of a younger, blonder, no glasses woman though?
Ahaha, this is too cute. I need to know if it worked though!
Cringe
This would also be great on r/funny
I doubt she is their mom.
"Yes mom!", they said with a loud bark.
Why was this made, those dumb dogs Wong understand that.
MOM ON = NO  
PHONE = BARK!
I hope they never stop barking.
Mom on = no

Phone = BARK
That the uh Plantronics Blackwire 5220 headset? That's a good model there.
My cat is very vocal and he's not happy at all about me being home all day and not sitting on the couch with him. He yells at me for the first hour or so of the day. He is slightly pleased when I bring a chair in for him to sit next to me on, but I think just because he can yell in my face more effectively.

We have 2 dogs and 2 cats... Working at home has never been a good option.

No, but they grow in the forest, they‚Äôre called bunnies and squirrels, occasionally birds.
The one in the Longhorns bandana looks like he‚Äôs trying really hard to understand the subject matter
Got it, when you put the snake hat on, go fucking nuts. Alright bud, we got our work cut out for us.
She‚Äôs clearly not a programmer and I don‚Äôt know C to make the joke work
Mom on = (‚ÄúNo ‚Äú)

I wonder how she got that drawing of herself
Dogs: "Damn, true fam"
That‚Äôs a very difficult font for dogs to read.
I love this!
But BORKING ok!
Great drawing.  Makes sense that she'd own an easel.
Worst teacher ever. üòÇ
Sort by controversial
She better be gaming
Is that mr peanutbutter?
Woof
As soon as I start talking to someone on the phone or video conference my dog gets uneasy. Starts boofing, gets agitated at everything outside, loses her mind at the person walking by from 2 blocks away. Goes back to sleep when the meeting ends. Thanks dude.
The one on the right
I feel like I gotta know more about that room.
mom on no, phone bark
The reason why they don't understand is because they are reading "mom on     no. Phone bark!" So they see the phone and bark, duh!

Edit: typo
but toilets do
Excuse me? *Dog starts eating acorns*
man, if only i payed that much attention during my lectures...
Time to invest in a rtx GPU and install rtx sound. It blocks out background noise flawlessly using the power of the GPU.
My dog has the decency to wait until it‚Äôs my turn to present to the conference call
Still, someone who calls in is probably hell bent on treating this woman like shit.
MOM ON = NO

PHONE = BARK

That drawing looks a little like the titan that ate Eren's mom in Attack On Titan. Or am I just imaginative?

Omggggg! It just me so awesome to have your dogs while you work!!!

...I mean, yeah it's not all good...

But stillllll!! :)
..........but bark gets attention when mom work, so when mom work = no attention = bark
So cute
Nice
Who is a good Longhorn? You are! Yes you are!
hope those dogs got it. they look focused
What she means: "*No barking when Mom is wearing headset thingy*"

What they understand: "*When Mom wears the headset thingy all dogs will be cut in half......with some extra human markings that dont make sense*"
LOL
Things people do for karma!
‚ÄúBut sticks do!‚Äù

You can see how much they love their dogs, they're in the background pictures üêæ‚ù§Ô∏è
You do know those dogs are performing satanic rituals in your living room. Right ?
No barking at home. Problem solved.
You may also find that your neighbors hate you less after this.
The drawing of her looks like an attack on titan character
Teach me your ways.
That caricature is spot on.

Why does she look like an NPC on the photo?
Mom on no phone bark.  Actually, it still makes sense.

"Excuse me, but I have a very important borking job here and it's not my fault you now have to stay home Karen. It's like they don't see how important I am to this house!".
Cute dogs. Brings me memories. Im a muslim. 1 day I was hanging by my construction site and 2 huge german Shepards came to me real close, sniffing around me. I had to tell them "yo man, Im a muslim and I cant touch you, dont lick me bro cuz I had to wash me self real hard later". Those 2 dogs seemed like they understood what I said. They went around close to 1-1.5 feet by me I had to stand still stiffly working while they went about their ways. 

There was another pup at my toolbox meeting, sniffing up my boots. Told him not to lick me. Pup nodded and curled on the ground like asking for belly rubs. Had to use a stick to give him some love rubs. Cute pup, now he grown up already looked like a pitbull.
Mom on = no

Phone = bark
I love how Texas this picture is :) And the puppers are sooooo cute!
So don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt bark...
A line graph indicating a sharp decline in pets, as barks increase, would also have been acceptable.
after hearing RTX sound the next thing every phone is going to have is AI sound filtering, this will all be a thing of the past soon.
I like how they are paying attention. But don't probably understand anything. Basically me in meetings.
Actually wolves eat berries so dog food does grow on trees
They look more obedient than actual children learning from home.
Dog on the right: I have no idea what your orders are, but I will follow them to the letter.
r/dontdeadopeninside
I feel you, my dogs decided to bark for the first time in my 2 weeks during my only meeting with my boss. Luckily I muted myself. To be fair there was some old dude looking at my neighbor's house.
The doggo on the right is digesting this like a champion. He's like, "Ahh, yes. This first lesson makes sense to me... even though trying not too might be a bit... *ruff"*
Haha they look so attentive. But the guy on the right looks like he's no less than three seconds away from letting a quick little bark - I can see it on his face.
Such fine looking and attentive pupils!

- when Mom on computer, Kitty no jump onto keyboard and swipe at mouse 
- when Mom writing in notebook, kitty no put big furry butt into middle of page
- when Mom using pen, Kitty no stalk and pounce on moving pen

In fact, I think I‚Äôm gonna need a bigger sign.

Sorry but, You or they really took the time to print out the photos, write mom on phone = no bark, put them on a board, got the dogs to sit in the right spot while knowing the dogs dont understand what you're doing or what the board says. What a waste of time for internet points.

Since "=" was used, that means that Mom is obligated to be on the phone whenever no bark. Equals sign works both ways.
