Zoinks!
If he starts talking, don‚Äôt do what he says
[deleted]
He looks like he needs a Scooby Snack. 
You can tell he is such a Great Dane.
9 year old me is jealous as fuck.  
That's not a Scooby, that's a Volvo.
Scooby-Dooby-Doo, where are you?
Those spots look painted on lmao bruh
Beautiful pup, but looks more like Marmaduke to me
ROOBIE-ROOOOO!
Great value Scooby Doo
LET'S SEE WHO YOU REALLY ARE! *Takes mask off, is Mr. Clippy from Microsoft Word*
Abu Dhabiiiiiiiii, man i miss home 
Rah row... I wuv wu raggy...
Ruh roh raggy
Why would someone crop a great dane's ears? Why would someone crop a dogs ears ever?
Do you dress up as a ghost to play?
Yes!!!! All these people posting not so great danes 
Is that an Abu Dhabi number plate I spy
Scoobert Doo.
Common misconception. That's Marmaduke
You...mad props to you...for the dog...and having a sickass Volvo S80 v8 model.
Ayy UAE üá¶üá™;))
Abu Dhabi FTW!
jinkies I found a good boi
This one's scooby, the other one is scrappy
After seeing all these posts about owning Scooby, I have one question... Scooby Dooby doooooo where is the real you??
Hey there fellow UAE citizen!
This is kind of weird, when I saw that trash bin and the brick on the ground, I knew it must be here... plus the plates after :)
Ruh roh
Abu Dhabi? 
That‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a pro stoner, not like the noob scoob that plays him on TV!
And a sweet Volvo S80 V8!  
Y la cosa suena ra!
Jokes on you. I have the real Daphne.
THATS THE UAE!!! üá¶üá™ 
S80 V8. 

Schwing.
Well. Where are you? We've got some work to do now.
[deleted]
Are those spots real? Incredible!
‚ù§Ô∏è
RRRAggy!!
Nice Volvo V8 in the background ;)
Abu dhabi 
Now it's time to get baked and start talking to him.
It's not a contest.
His real name is Scoobert Doobert 
V8 Volvo üòèüëåüèª

SCOOB OL' BUDDY OL' PAL OL' CHUM.
This is the correct Scooby Doo, thank you. Everyone else was posting Scrappy Doo-looking dogs but calling their dogs Scooby Doo. Scooby Doo was a Great Dane. As my favorite cartoon growing up, it was a bit annoying no one was posting a Great Dane and yet calling it Scooby Doo. Finally.
Look at that penis.
Are his patches real or drawn on? 
Hell yes you do! Awesome üëç‚ù§Ô∏èhim.
I think we can agree we need to see more pictures
why does this picture look rendered
Are those spots fake?  
* Pass Shaggy the baggie 'cause Scooby needs a doobie!

With a hint of Tim Curry.
Where I grew up (usually only on local maps, but outside London Ontario) there is a ‚Äúlocal‚Äù who drives around in a custom van that looks like an exact replica of the Mystery Machine. My husband and I still don‚Äôt know where they are actually from (a lot of small townships in the area)
Shit. It's that dog. Those meddling kids aren't too far away. 

I've got to find a different abandoned amusement park to play with my mask collection and make "Woooooo-oooooooohhhhhhhh" sounds now.
Needs a tan and less spots -let‚Äôs be honest. 


Please note I did upvote. 

EDIT:
I am incorrect. Spots are spot on. 
How many scooby snacks do you have to eat before he talks to you?
I feel like the other poster had scrappy and not Scooby-Doo anyways. I loooove great danes too‚ù§Ô∏è
Like zoinks scoob we ran out of Scooby snacks
You roobee doo!
At least your doggo still has his boy parts.  Poor Scooby-Doo has got nothin' down there.
Those spots look painted/drawn on.... I really hope they aren't. 
Marmaduke meets scooby doo
/u/laliza thoughts ?
Looks like a very good boyo. My big muddy boy says [h e n l o](https://i.imgur.com/y5fjMXh.jpg)
Did you paint him by any chance?
r/gatekeeping 
Perfection
You really got those spots on his body spot on. Really, painting them on so perfectly must have been ruff.
I‚Äôm the REAL Dirty Dan.
The shermanator ( Õ°¬∫ Õú ñ Õ°¬∫)


I wonder what mystery unfolded in Abu Dhabi
This is a scooby dooby don‚Äôt 
Oh my dog that is such a cute floofer, you got the collar and everything! :O
If you're a stoner with 70s pants you're officially my hero
Did you paint your dog?! His spots look painted. Lmao. 
That's Marmaduke
Dat V8 S80 tho
He's beautiful.
Beautiful dog, funny costume, but sorry for the ears though...
The only thing I saw is the first movie adaptation. Is it sad?
A dog can't even lay low without being found. He retired, had plastic surgery, got married and even got himself a Volvo (he never liked the Mystery Machine) but the paparazzi are still on his case.
Looks like you live in the Middle East, am I wrong?
Are those painted on spots?
They already made one of these and the movie sucked.
I gotta see a pic of you (the owner), my dude. Please confirm you look like Shaggy.
Rog? Rhere?
Looks more like "Marmaduke"
You rang?
He looks like an unstoppable doofus!
Yeah, my senses are saying that this is a good boy...
Khalifa City A?

and you would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for these meddling reddit kids!
Nope. You put this spots on yourself.  I am not bamboozled
Thy always getting white actors to play black/brown roles . This is worse than the Moses film .
Are those painted on? For real. They kinda look like it and they‚Äôre too perfect...
I just showed this pic to my daughter and it made her whole day. Thanks Scooby (Sherman Michael)!! 
Where are the Scobby Snacks?! üíï
Marma Doo
Looks more like Marmaduk.
I'm torn between thinking how cute he is vs how much money it costs to feed him.
It‚Äôs him!! Absolutely PERFECT!!!
you know i hadda Scooby dooby do it to em
Abu Dhabi!!
‚ÄúSpot‚Äù on
ROOBY ROO!
Scooby doo lives in Arab ?
Strange though
I don't have any recollection of being anywhere that looks like that.
I have a sneaking suspicion that that dog was spray painted. If so...2 things: 1) How dare you abuse an animal for reddit karma! 2) I admire your determination to earn reddit karma.
He doesn't look like Scooby Doo at all aside from the collar
Upvoting because there's a Volvo in the picture with a cute dog. 
Barely any resemblance tbh. Maybe just the collar 
[removed]
Oh yea?! The REAL Scoobert Doo would smoke 6 pounds of weed, abandon his nephew, and blatantly ignore the speech therapy he so desperately needs!!!!!

I don't have many friends
Weird how his fur is covered in marker üôÑ
Marmaduke
But do you have the real Slim Shady?
He looks ready to solve some mysteries(and eat big sandwiches).
Scooby dooby doo, where are you?  The sub would like to find you..
But does he talk? 
Ruh roh! Too cute :D
"!"

I hope he's getting lots of snacks and solving lots of mysteries.
What's the dogs name?
Well done! Where did you get the collar tag?
Pretty close. But he's too light in color. He also doesn't look high.
Jinkies!!
I love this scooby trend!
Raggy! Rwhere are roo?!

I can already hear the "ROOBYDOOBYDOOOO"
Wait a minute! That‚Äôs not Scooby! It‚Äôs Red Herring! 

Did you dress him up when he was a pup too?
That pavement made me feel very nostalgic for home. Whole area looks similar to home back in dubai haha
Are those spots real or painted on?
Better give him some Scooby snacks for me!
Cute dog!

Did you dye him for the costume or are those spots real?
Loving this beautiful doggie and all the comments here!  Strolling down memory lane.  Ahhh....  Memories!  :-D
Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
Haha that's cool but.... no I have no dog

You're missing the Scooby Snacks which have weed in them.
The real question is, why would you put a chair in front of a bin, i mean if you sit in the chair it's just gonna smell like garbage the whole time
What breed of dog is this? I see them around a lot but never thought to find out what kind it is.
Will the real scooby doo please stand up?
Yup you win the scooby doo contest 
it's so similar
Will the real Scooby Doo please stand up.  Please stand up.
Alright so who has the real-life Scrappy Do? Let's see him. 
I have a Dane with the same coloring (also ears are still long ) 
Dobby dooby doo hehehe. 
Wow
Get a minivan 
Uh oh warggy
I‚Äôm sure you didn‚Äôt ... but are those spots painted on ? Please say no . They look fake . 
Don't paint your dog....
Check for a mask
Lol is this gonna be the new trend now
Where is this dog?
*Scoobert Doobert
nice
Wow neat! I wonder if this was the dog Scooby Doo was based on.
Shaggy? is that you?
Looks like he's certainly been eating like scooby doo 
...
Have you painted your dog? 
Roh my gawd
Did you only post this in response to that baby supper that looked like Scoobs on the front page ?!?!?!
Too cute
It's not Scoobert Doobert.  It's Scoobert Doo
Tell me his name is scooby
Aww he's so handsome üòÄüòÄüòÄ
Could someone tell me why Great Danes don't look as much like Scooby Doo as other dogs on Reddit do. Even though Scooby was a Great Dane
Jenkies!
Is that a Bahraini license plate?
Looks like someone stepped on him with dress shoes on. 
Dooby dooby  doo...
I was under the impression it is against the law to dock ears and tails in Europe . Am I right or am I wrong?
Ruh Roh!
quick, someone throw a scooby snack to this good boy!
Well done üê∂ üêæ üçÄ üòò

Hey so when‚Äôd they start drawing his penis?

You better pet them and tell them they are a good boy/girl or else üò°

Everybody has a scooby-doo, will this ever get old. Answer- NO. 
looks like the dog they used in that liveaction movie
You are real scrappy then
Okay , this is epic!
Perfection!
Come on those spots cannot be genuine. They're Spot-on.
Tear off the mask and see who the real villain is. Probably the guy who owns the abandoned amusement park. 
Please tell me you named him Scooby Doo.....
Pictures of dogs that look like Scooby Doo are the new cancer-free dog pics.

Perfect specimen!  BUT...you drew those spots on with a sharpie, didn't you OP?  
Is he always baked?
You have the real Scoopy Doo

Amazed at the size of this lad. Absolute unit
Scooby doo was brown wasn‚Äôt he.... the Mandela effect
This. Is. Fucking. AWWWesome. I hope you give him all the scooby snax. 
Is this in Dubai? The UAE? Your compound looks awfully familiar...
Rooby roo?
I had a Great Dane. They are such cool dogs with great personalities. I just feel bad they don‚Äôt live that long because of their size. 
KSI???
Give him pet for me pls
Scooby! Is that footprint on your shoulder a clue?
Scoobert doobert 
Cmon scoob!

Are...are those spots painted on?
Why do you keep letting those meddling kids take Scoob into danger?
üòÆ!  
Wow

The Volvo in the background lacks the panache of the Mystery Machine unfortunately
I think the other one looks more like Scooby-Doo. This one has the spots but that's it. Still a very good boye and v v v cute 
No that's Marmaduke in disguise
Yo you just got that song stuck in my head my guy. 
WuuhWoh

Black in fur was either painted on or photoshopped on. 
Yo scooby u gay Af

I haven't watched Scooby Doo fully doh! 
Aww Scooby!!! 
Ayyy I live in Abu Dhabi too
r/rarepuppers
Can we make a separate sub Reddit just for dogs that look like Scooby-Doo 
Ru-roh!
Looks like the owner used shoe polish to make those spots. That‚Äôs a well done counterfeit Scoob 
Like, Weirdoo..
Spray painted for internet points.
I searched by image; a real Scooby was my 24th result. You are getting closer.
So you're one of "those meddling kids" I've always heard about! 
#AbuDhabi !!!
Wow! Are those spots real? 
Herrow Scooby!
This dog is a really looking like scooby Doo. But is this also afraid of ghosts????
That's awesome 
will the real scooby doo please sit. good boy. 
Thats marmaduke you chode smack
Jinkies, it‚Äôs a clue, Scooby-doo! 
This put a grin on my face!

Is he named Scooby Doo?
bet you won't post a video of him eating a scooby snack <3

Does he talk? 
In Connecticut there was someone who owned and would casually drive around in a Mystery Machine. Find them.

nice dog 
He's gonna need some scooby-snacks... 
Zoinks scoob!

I can tell, he looks stoned af. :)
Did you... Draw on your pup ?? 
How cute!! üòçüòç
You can tell he's a happy camper just by his eyes. 
Scoobert Doobert
Shaggy, is that name even allowed now 
And Raggy, too?
I'd be petting him right now if it weren't for you meddling kids!
Rooby racks???
This is such a good boy.  I miss having a Great Dane so much.
This is amazing
Like Scoob!!!

Yes, but how often does your Scooby hurt himself due to being a clumsy oaf?
Omg I love this!

This is so cute. I absolutely love this.
Im almost certain you added them spots yourself,although i hope you didnt
I wanna hug him and thank him for my childhood... So badly...

He looks like the best doggo!

cool

So are you the real Sammy ?
Shrrrraaaaaaggyyyyyyyyy
Probably will get lost in the comments, but worth a shot after seeing OP's unawareness of ear cropping. Please, do not do such mutilations. This is a cosmetic procedure. If your dog gets an infection, take it to the bloody vet like you would for anything else! On a side note, research things before you get a pet.
Why do those spots look painted on? I feel bamboozled by OP, that big fat liar.
Ro ruck rurself
Spots are fake.

Looks nothing like him.

Still blows my mind that they could make a kid's show with that name and theme.
Pretty sure the dog tag was edited in.
Scooby Doo doesn‚Äôt have spots bro
You should make the license plate not in the pic.. I already know where this is, your name, your favorite type of fish and your grandmothers favorite animal
