F.R.I.E.N.D.S with pets
That’s soooooo cute < says in madtvs Lorraines voice
The power trio
Awwwwww
Too cute! Such sweeties
Found my new wallpaper
This feels like they're posing for a great album cover.
My dog has to sit for feeding time and the cats know “backup”.

They all used to try and shove their heads under and around me while I was trying to pour food out.
Great picture
Either that or plotting an invasion.
Here’s Johnny!
cuties!!!

can I save this photo???
Gang: Mom  grandma would have fed us 10times already
Babies
there coming for you
Mom made PIZZA ROLLSSS
The lower cat is standing up. The dog is standing up. The top cat is that tall?
Your pup seems cool, but those cats are *serious!*
Cuteness overload. Just stay like that for a while
*Always Sunny theme*
This looks like an image out of a children’s picture book. I love it.
Should call Pet-protective-services.   Clearly unfed for weeks. /s.   Mine start singing ‘We are the World!’… at 4:00 am and 4:00 pm.   The times are dictated at this point… would like it to be at least 5:45 am but the union won’t allow…
3 round face!
what are they waiting for
Am I to believe there is a gang out there that doesn't contain a bird?
And judgeing from their looks you have less than a minute or face the consequences
Blended families are the best.  
  
And I think the "purist" type of pet owners are untrustworthy as hell.
Cat on top: "Is it ready!?! Is it ready!?! I can't wait!!"

Dog in middle: "Whenever you're ready.....I'll wait here patiently."

Cat at the bottom: "Hurry up, Harold!! We don't have all day!!"
I hope everyone sees this today. 🥺
I didn't know I needed this until I saw it.
Idk what the initiation to get into that gang is, but I’ll do it
I love them.

That is a great shot. : )
The little people lol.
I would really like to see what is holding up the cat on the top of the stack.
I want to go to that party!
Bottom one looks slightly vexed
When you said pspsps twice and woof once.
The new Five Nights at Freddy's looks weird
Fake news, all are paid actors.
Hungry babies!!!
You have really cute pets.
So damn cute!!😂🤣😂
when the pets are sleeping in the other room and you open the fridge
They’re STARVING! Have you no compassion? It’s been three minutes since they last ate!!!!
This is my new favorite picture.

Watcha doing? Can we help? Is it foods? OMG it IS foods! We lubs foods 💕

Let-me-in-let-me-in-let-me-in 😸😸😸😸😸
Cat is so cinfused
Doggy is pussywhipped! 🤣
This is utterly adorable!
Burglar!!!!
Thanks! I'll use this as a wallpaper
ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ
Mom, hey mom. Mom mom mom mom mom mom… you’re pretty.
I do enjoy seeing pups and kits in solidarity
This photo feels like home, proverbially speaking.
This truly is an incredible picture
This made me cry.

They look exactly like my pets except my two two cats are dead, one quite recently. Please give the cats extra treats in honour of the late Ozzie the Prince of Darkness and Ziggy Stardust. Obviously the dog needs a treat too and I'll give my Bear a dried pig nose as they are his favourite thing.


Edit. Also it appears you have way more monkeys than me as well.
These Jehovah witnesses are getting out of hand.
Alvin, Simon, ... THEODORE!!!!
Wat da hooman doin?
When you’re a mom trying to pee in peace
HEY! You know dam well you can’t shit alone. Hooman you might fall in. Or something cool might happen in there!
Considering that the world is on the verge of nuclear war, it’s a nice picture to calm my nerves.
r/animalalbumcovers
This looks like a Norman Rockwell painting.
I imagine this moment, viewed from behind them, is funny as heck.
This legit looks like it comes from a cartoon or something
You've made us wait too long Karen. Feed us now or we will break down this door!
So adorable!!! 🥰
How cruel of owner
Shit. Come to the U.S., friend...Trmpublicans are siding with their demagogue's boss.
" We heard you open the cabinet and wanted to make sure you were safe" - the pets (probably)
They are spying on you

Aww ,too cute
It’s funny. Same time. Different House and Animals but some beautiful little faces when they are hungry or want attention. Thank you. After seeing this picture I will have a great day it made me laugh & Smile.😇
This needs to be turnes into cartoon
As a shiba owner, I just see 3 cats.
I know the feeling!!
Wallpapered!😉😁thanks bro
They look like a cartoon
Adorable.
Definitely Japan
This is the most realistic episode of Looney Tunes I've ever seen
This is something straight out of …ooh what were those children’s books call? The ones where the momma cat is wearing slippers and father, who’s an inchworm, is driving home from work?
"The Gang Forgets to Ask for Snacks"
I love the kitty on top.
I hope you plan to frame this! It’s the best
Omg this is sooo cute…and that dog’s chocolately brown nose makes me melt. 🥺❤️🦮
Maybe earlier should have had lunch?
“Do not test our patience, else we will make a dinner ourselves”
This is so good. How did it even happen? Its like in cartoons...lol
Aww that kitty has a heart shaped mark on its nose. Too precious.
Adorable
Honestly, this pet combo is so underrated. I used to have a dog with kitten minions when I was younger and it was so much fun because it always looked like they were up to no good
The cat on top, lol.

Best movie poster/album cover of the year
The oh so cute face of hunger
Looks like a pet totem pole.
Reminds me of Friends 💕
😂😂😂
Pictures you can fucking hear

GET OUT!!
Looks like a scene from the walking dead...
This looks like it could be a poster for a CG talking animal movie.
That dog is like day 576 nobody has found me out
The Shining?!!
That middle cat looks kind of strange… hmmm…
Looks like my house for sure!
So no one is gonna talk about the fact that both his cats have a dick on there face?
Too cute
Too cute😂
It reminds me of the Thanksgiving episode of Friends!!!
Doohhh Reyyy Eggooonnn
This is exactly what i needed today. <3
It’s funny how curious yet calm they look!
Plot twist: OP is a taxidermist.
This is just perfection!  I’m an elementary school counselor. I’m going to make this into a little poster.

You’ve captured the personality of each one of them so well in this photo!
Gave me a great giggle. These guys are so sweet.
I needed this.
The next frame when the door fully closes on them isn’t as cute.
I just got my first cat after moving out of my parents house a year ago (they are allergic to cats). It’s my dream to build a family like this one day. 🥺
Awesome shot
they're adorable!!!
what are the doing
I love all of them
r/awwwwwwwww
I must download this, one of these healing stuff for our ever growing mad world. Thank you!
3 of my pets (2 dogs and 1 cat) like to gang up in the kitchen together while we cook. The 4th one doesn't like our dogs (another cat), so she just watches from the corner lol.
OP, get this on r/photoshopbattles before someone else does!
Don’t dead open inside
ambush !
🌸
There's your movie poster for when you make your film.
they’re all so cute!! 🥰
paid actors
cuteeee
What a handsome family
the one at the bottom ain't messin around.   If you don't lets them in for treat you will suffer the most terrifying fate.
who is holding the top cat up?
You better feed them and give them treats for waiting
Jindos are basically cats.  Makes perfect sense.  Lovely photo.
Bremen Town musicians?
[Haha this reminds of the scene from FRIENDS where they are stuck at the door waiting for the Thanksgiving dinner](https://imgur.com/a/Uvq8Cy2)
🎼 HELLO, 🎵 HELLO, 🎵 HELLO🎶
Thank you for this. Stuff like this keeps be going these days. I would like to see more pictures of all these little faces please.

Top cat reminds me of Joey.
Thanks it's my new outscreen wallpaper
Bless pets! Theyre so cute
I love them 🥺
best thing ive seen in weeks😂
what breed of dog is that
This is what I see when I’m trying to poo in piece
The One with the Late Thanksgiving
Where's Frank & Sweet Dee?
This is like in TV shows when they stack characters peeking around a corner so that you can see everyone's faces haha
This is too dang cuuiiuuite! 😻😻
When its dinner time, its a neutral zone.  All pets that dont get along can agree that they are hungry and excited about food.
“Open the door or I'm gonna throw rocks through your windows you dumb -“ 🤣🤣🤣
They here the bag 😂
This looks just like one of those cartoons!
Little Rascals
DON'T PETS

What an adorable stack of animals ♥️
"Here's Johnny!" LOL is all I think when I see that face sticking through the crack.

Lawd!  *cuteness overload*
This is a Renaissance painting
IT BELONGS IN A MUSEUM
wow
Gross ... I can smell this picture. I'm an Hvac Tech and anytime I go into a customers house with multiple pets,  it always always always smells like piss inside. Such a gross demographic in terms of living conditions and hygiene. Downvote away ... doesn't make me wrong.
They're really cute! Like from any children book!

😂
*sergeant they're leaking through the walls*
I’d like to see an anime version of this photo. I love it!
Coming to Netflix.
Lmao
Dinner time is above and below him.
This could be an album cover.
Someone draw a picture of what their bodies probably look like behind the door
Why does this remind me of anime?
I want to see some artist renditions of what shape the top cat’s body is in behind the door
Ok well that’s adorable!!!
Oh how cute
Frame it!
Helloooooo

Scooby doo vibes

The fact that there is one cat piled on the dog, but the dog don't care because there's food involved.

Somehow reminds me of the Town Musicians of Bremen 😂
This should become a painting

This is like how cartoons are drawn together when they're sneakily watching someone around the corner or through a door like this 😂
Which one does that white paw closest to the door belong to?

Maybe a 4th critter?
My dog looks EXACTLY like that ! What type of dog are they??
Phone wallpepr
Its like they are planning a Dinner Heist 

Cat 1: I go distract human   
Doggo 1: Okay And I grab food  
Cat 2: If all else fails I join and grab food and yeet myself towards human

Doggo 1 and Cat 1 Oke   
Doggo 1: I get half and you cat get half deal?

Cat 1 and Cat 2: Deal
A straight-up cartoon
Maybe, or someone is in the bathroom.

Or your trying to take a shit.
This is that one scene in every zombie movie where one of the main characters holds the door and you can see the zombies through the crack in the door lol
“Is it ready yet?”

“What is mum stirring in?”

“Do we get wet food tonight?”

“Watch your tail!  It’s wagging in my face!”

“Who sniffed my butt?”

“Oh, go chase the red dot already!”
*"Something smells fishy here..."*
Omg. So cute 😭😭😭
Hang this photo above your fireplace
This is the cutest! 😭😍😍
