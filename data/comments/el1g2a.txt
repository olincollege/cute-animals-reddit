Damnit Roach!
Someone said "bath"
How did her even get up there?
r/whatswrongwithyourdog
THERE WAS A SPIDER!
It‚Äôs over hooman! I have the high ground!
Nah, not broken. I do the same thing whenever I see a spider.
I couldn't be mad. I'd be too damn impressed
She jumps on the fridge, there was a cat up there and she wanted to play.
How in the world did the doggo get up there?
Looks like you accidentally installed the cat OS on your dog hardware. What you're gonna want to do is carefully get it down and then put the unit in standby mode. If you were running the dog OS this would be a verbal command of your choosing like "sit" or "stay" (though this feature is unstable on some hardware), but for the cat OS all you need to do is [squish that cat](https://youtu.be/OAGfx7eB3gA). Once the unit is in standby mode, you're going to want to throw a toy and let the unit retrieve it, then say "good boy" or "good girl". Dog hardware is hardwired to update to the latest version of the dog OS when this happens, so it should correct the issue. Sometimes a unit needs to totally power down to install the update, so a long walk and lots of treats may accelerate the process.

Alternatively, cat OS has many advantages and it is possible to keep it stable and running in dog hardware. For example, pooping in a box eliminates a lot of maintenance work for the user and the cat OS has superior self cleaning functions. Cat OS also spends more time in power saver mode and has the proprietary purr feature. You may need to invest in some scratching posts though and cat OS has a lot of reported issues with mood swings.
That‚Äôs a funny looking cat
Barkour.  

Just thinking like a crafty dog, I‚Äôll guess floor to open dishwasher door to cabinet to fridge top to cabinet top.  Like I said, some barker-parkour goin on there!

That, or a ladder and someone who thought this would just be hysterical on Reddit.  

Either way, pup looks pretty uncomfortable.
‚ÄúSee, dad? LOOK!‚Äù
Negotiations about "who was the best boy ?" took longer than expected

Come down and we can talk..
Your mountain goat looks perfectly healthy to me.
But like..... how?
Your cat got an upgrade
Hardcore Barkore
Oh my god I had no idea this would be so popular...This is my dog her name is Stormy.  ü§£ü§£
When he thinks he is a cat.
I like that kitchen
A Cupboarder Collie?
Damn it Roach!
Ah, a Shepard being...a Shepard.

They have liquid crazy running through their veins.
I think the dog thinks he is a cat.
Roach?
He‚Äôs being different, an expression of the true self.
So this...uh, this isn't normal?
Roach!
"So uhhhh...ya...howabout you just get me down and we forget this happened...."
That cat is huge!!!
Question: is there a problem between the dogs?  Maybe he's trying to get away from the other 2?
Your dog is above all else.
It's just updog no worries
Cute cat
Roach come down from there!
Your dog come from Witcher 3 universe I suppose
It's like when you go outside then inside any door too quick in a Bethesda game with a companion
Dog is cat
Why would any one put their dog on top of the cabinet like that?
Really raising the woof
I believe the technical term is "borken" but yes, that would be what you've got there.
Is this dog from the same litter as [the dog on the roof?](https://youtu.be/0rAzO_sREiI)
My mom would come home and find her mutt walking around her roof. It would jump on the boat into the garage. It couldn't get down on it's own.  From the street the garage looked detached but the cover over the patio connects to the garage
Cat.exe running on dog hardware
Dog isnt broken. Just found a glitch in the matrix.
I think someone accidentally installed cat.exe in your dog.
Reminds me of the time my neighbor's dog got on their roof. He was this hyper husky, but he just... chilled up there
Buy a dog instead of a cat.

They said.

They don't climb on furniture.

They said.
That dog identifies as cat.
Rightfully getting away from the unpredictable snapping of those pits
That dog is awesome
Really strange question, do you live in ID?? My kitchen last year had a super similar layout
Your dog needs a walk.
And here I am having trouble getting my pup to keep her front paws off the kitchen counter...
That cat seems to be working perfectly.
The tension in this photo is staggering.
"day 5 of gluing my dad's possessions to the ceiling"
So you live in bend or?
Even the other dogs are trying to figure out what the fuck it thinks it's doing
thats a goat
Your dog has temporarily become a cat.  We apologize for any inconvenience.
For a second I thought pic was from the guy that's putting his dads stuff on the ceiling, one item a day.
Looks like you installed cat.exe instead of dog.exe ooops!
ITS OVER ANAKIN! IVE GOT THE HIGH GROUND
Love how the other two dogs are like "Gary, what the fuck you doing up there?"
It‚Äôs over......he has the high ground.
This dog isn't broken, it's just high
Goat dog.
That dog is actually a goat.
Cat mode enabled.
\*Runs cat.exe\*

Dog: "I should not have done that"
Yup, you're dog's gravity stabilizer is busted. It's only about $60 for the part if you want to replace it yourself, but I'd recommend bringing him into the shop.

How does anyone think this is real?  The dipshit put the dog up there for the photo which is why it looks scared.
Not broken, overclocked
Yes that is what they mean.
r/whatswrongwithyourdog

r/AccidentalRenaissance maybe?
HE JUST LIKES TO FEEL TALL.
That's not a dog. That's a cat in disguise.
Is that dog‚Äôs name ‚ÄúRoach‚Äù?
This reminds me of The Witcher for some reason.
Day 4 of sticking things to the ceiling until my dad notices...
I have the same microwave
Have you questioned u/SeamanTheSailor? This seems like something he would do.
I have those same cabinets.
I like how your other two dogs are like ‚Äúwtf dude‚Äù
That's not a dog, that's a cat.
Perhaps the folks at r/whatswrongwithyourdog can assist.
Probably trying to get that hot 'n ready on the counter. Heard you coming and went higher.
Roach manages to get himself into the strangest places.
He has the high ground. Dont try it
"Pitiful human, don't you know that the floor is lava!!"
Just uninstall the dog.exe file and reinstall. That should take care of it!
I love how the other two dogs are just as confused as the human.
I love how everyone is watching
Bro you have a cat
Day 5 of sticking my dad‚Äôs things to the ceiling: doggo.
No reason why he CAN'T get up there. Lots of reasons why he SHOULDN'T get up there.
His aerial stabilizers are off. You're going to need a vortex spanner and 3 yards of Duck tape.
You sir, have a cat.
"Tony. Step back from the ledge. We love you, man. Think of all the things you have to live for. The bones. The bitches."

***HOW DID HE EVEN GET UP THERE?***
Dammit Roach!
Just open that Little Caesars box and the dog will get down on its own.
The other dogs are like, "How did you even do that?!"
It's over, hooman, I have the high ground!
The only thing that's going through my mind right now:

      GREY, HOW DID YOU GET UP THERE?!?!
Other two dogs lookin on like yeah, this gon be a thing from now on
How?
r/thisismylifenow 

He looks like hes regretting his life decisions
Now that's what I call a triple dog dare. Ba dom pshh.
This is a story of a dog named "goat".
How?!!!
He's not broken. He's just pretending to be a cat.
love how all his dog friends are looking up too
Sir, your cat was someone born in the body of a dog.  I know we don't usually do this for pets, but we're going to have to drug him so he is in the body of a cat too. 

\*horror comes over the owner\*
Uhhh


How..?
The other dogs are like ‚ÄúYou did it... you son of a bitch you actually did it.‚Äù
Better get 'im quick before he clips out of bounds. This is a glitchless run after all.
The other dogs are as confused as the guy is.
perfect renaissance pic
I see no god up here... except for me
I have several questions as to how the dog got up there
He‚Äôs been watching the cat.
No I'd say that dog is *high-functioning.*
Of course it's a Shepard
He is probably afraid of that weed whacker on the back of that pittie.
The dog isn't broken.
The dog is borken
It's spirit animal is the cat.And it got "spirited" by it.
how the frick frack tic tac did he get up there-
That's Bridget,  she's got a problem with retardation, but she's full of love.
Day 5 of sticking my dad's possessions to the ceiling. This time, a dog.
How did he get there lol
This is the difference in dogs and cats. A cat there is saying ‚Äúfuck you. This is my dominion,‚Äù while a dog is like, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I did this or how to get out of this. Please help me.‚Äù
The floor is lava
So this is that updog everyone was talking about
Only one question.......how
I'm pretty sure that's a cat...
Maybe he thinks he‚Äôs a goat.  Or the sheep that scale cliffs.
That's no dog. It's a cat.
‚ÄúBarry get down there.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôll yell at me.‚Äù

‚ÄúJim, why is Barry summoning the anti christ?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe may never know...‚Äù
No.  It means you put your dog on top of the cabinets and took a picture.
You have a cat.
Maby better to ask on r/whatswrongwithyourdog
"Hell naw. There are pit bulls down there."
I wouldn't worry. Your dog is just having a high-level cabinet meeting.
OMG!  The weirdest place I ever found one of mine was in the middle of the dining room table.
I like that the other dogs are also wondering this about their friend.
Op : is this dog broken
We : yes lmao
Apparently my dog does this when I'm not home. I've never seen her like this but when I've had people over who have seen her get up.
It's an entity collisions bug with the cupboards. Press Ctrl+Shift+C and type "phyReset".
It's just bad NPC programming.
I see no God from up here...

*Except for me*
This is just a classic case of updog
That's some top shelf dog!
 I think your dog found his/her happy place. My cat has been going nuts for a month strait too. Pets are a handful. Also, I noticed but we have the same microwave and oven. Could it be that those cloud people I‚Äôve been hearing about lately are communicating through those exact appliances and scaring the crap out of our pets?  Besides that, they‚Äôre great appliances. I cooked like 3 chickens already and they came out so so good!!!! Anyway, nice kitchen, cute dogs and happy new year
Nah, this is two hunting dogs treeing and holding their quarry. That poor dog up there
Maybe he‚Äôs just hiding from the pit bulls?
My cat once climbed on the roof of my (parents's) 3 story house. He's scared of heights.
You have a cat
Day 116 of glueing stuff to the ceiling until dad notices
I think the dog believes it's a goat...
I am more amazed how early 2000s this all looks. You even wear long sleeves under short sleeves.
Apparently this dog decided that he was a cat.
Having a Pit mix rescue and Shepard mix rescue, this situation does perfectly reflect their respective personalities...
LISTEN, I SAW A SQUIRREL OK?

Can confirm. Dog is broken.  

Had the same issue with my mutt. Bethesda customer service was super helpful. After confirming that I did, in fact, download Dog.exe, they sent me a new download code and haven't had a Dogmeat on the cabinets since...

...also, had to install a Dogmeat gate between the family room and kitchen, but that didn't take up too much storage and solved the problem completely
ITS UPDOG
Fucking losers that clearly put the dog up there for internet fame
That dog is at a safer distance from the pit. 

It‚Äôs probably better he stays up there until the pit is gone.
Animal cruelty
That blue/white doggo is gorgeous!
The guy clearly put the dog up there to see her/his reaction, why is this ‚Äúdog is broken‚Äù material?
Trying to avoid getting fixed.
The man has to be 6.5 ft tall. Just reach up and get it down.
Your dog is getting up on the highest level to show dominance over the other dogs probably because it feels threatened.
Oh, are we pretending he didn‚Äôt put the dog up there himself?  Ok.
"I have the high ground now human. Don't try it"
He‚Äôs afraid for his life, that‚Äòs not funny
Someone clearly put it up there. Fucking Reddit

How tf does it get up there
It might be possessed...
Yup, he broke.

This looks a lot like my grandparents house. Is this is Ohio by chance?
Yo how the fuck you get into our house and why is your dog up there
Probably smelled the pizza and began floating up there like it was Tom and Jerry
No such thing as a truly broken dog
Bark-our!
Our cats do this never thought I‚Äôd see a dog do it
I have a Dutch Shepherd who would try this if I ever put the treats on top of the cabinet again. So we don't. If he ever learns he can climb trees like he climbs *every.damn.thing.else.* we're *screwed!*

Hey, it's updog!
I thought it‚Äôs ear was it‚Äôs nose for a second, that was a trippy minute
I wanna say yes....but I feel like dogs can be more broken. I feel like this is a 6 or 7 on the broken doggo scale
Yep. Also, that kitchen looks like it could be near me because I have seen a lot of houses in my area on Zillow that have kitchens exactly like that
Be careful, he has the high ground
that's a cat!

Maybe it isn‚Äôt your dog that‚Äôs broken, but your house that‚Äôs broken. Either way I hope your dog is housebroken.
But removing the reproductive parts won't solve this problem.
Pretty sure that's a cat in dog clothing
Figured he could get to the treats from above.

I love this! When I order pizza I put the pizza on top of the fridge otherwise my dog will counter surf the stove and eat it.

Eventually she learned to open the oven door climb on it, then climb on the counter and grab the pizza from the top of the fridge. I was so impressed I didn't even get mad.

Dogs are smart.

Jumped on the counter to steal pizza. Heard human walk in. Panicked and jumped on the fridge and then the top cabinets.

This is what happens before the screen goes black and the text "you died" appears.
Is he part goat?  How does the happen?
When your dog thinks it's a cat!
He's just running cat software, reboot in maintenance mode and try loading with a third party package like milkbone.exe instead of the meow mix
Did you try turning it on and off again?
Ma, the dog's on the fucking cabinets...
HOW.
NO DONT JUMP
Must have been a huge sale on that counter top. It‚Äôs every where.
How does the guy open those cabinets?
Dog is holding up falling ceiling, dog is hero!

Thank your breeder + dog's parents. He /she has good ass genes.
No bath.

Day 5 of sticking my dads stuff until he notices
HOW?!
As I scrolled this post up towards the top of my phone, I thought it was an update from the person glueing their dad‚Äôs stuff to the ceiling.  Now I‚Äôm a little disappointed.
Hi
Day 5 of sticking my dad‚Äôs things to the ceiling
Exactly. Physically fine and functionally wrong.
Amazing! How‚Äôd he do that?üòÜ

The dog's tail looks like some sort of brush or broom sticking out of his ass

Your dog hardware has cat software installed. I suggest a reset via a bath.
Asking for a friend, a...man's best friend

And they say pit bulls are the crazy ones.
The floor is lava.
