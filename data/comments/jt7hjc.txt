Well this is absolutely stupid. I definitely haven't been staring at this awwing over it and now wanting a pregnant foster dog. Pffft. That'd be stupid... *googles foster dogs near me*
Whoa what’s the deal with the ultrasound photo?!
I am just now realizing I have never seen a pregnant dog before.
My sweet foster girl was rescued from the streets when we found out she was pregnant. She may have gotten knocked up while on the streets, but she’s going to be a spoiled girl from now on! Follow my Instagram @caitiesfosterfam for updates on her and her pups! She’s due any day now ❤️

Edit: well, she’s in labor!
Well,  I just can’t handle this cuteness! 🥰
Send photos of the pups! Can’t wait.
I’ve never seen a more adorable baby bump. I’m glad she’s in foster for her situation, where she & her babies can be spayed/neutered 💕
This is the most excessive thing I have ever seen, and I’m so in love with it!
How stinkin cute are y'all 😍 💖  love this!
This is so pure and beautiful. Thank you for giving this dog the love she deserves.
Yay! It’s Caitie!! Y’all, she is an INCREDIBLE foster and all around amazing human. If you aren’t following her IG, I highly recommend to. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll fall in puppy love, and hopefully you’ll be inspired to become a foster or an adopter. 

u/caitiesfosterfam I’m still working on “Jericoh’s Law”. 65 of 67 candidates endorsed by the THLN won their seats, so that will make getting something endorsed, introduced, and hopefully passed a little easier now. It will take some time, but I haven’t forgotten and won’t forget little Jericho.
That first picture...I needed that today so thank you.
Oh that's not a foster dog any more. That's a "not quite official adopted dog" now.
Dumb cute

Whatever, have your upvote. You’ve earned it.
This is the content I want to see! None of them gender reveals that go wrong more often than not. Now this, is wholesome! 💜💜
i didnt read the caption and i thought you got married and got pregnant with a dog.

i’m not sorry.
This is the best pregnancy photoshoot ever
I saw you post this in one of the doodle groups I follow on FB and absolutely adored it ♥️ I think it's a super cute idea.
She’s radiant 💗
That's one adorable mother pupper.
We want all the updates! Good job on being an amazing foster parent!
I would give this a thousand awards if I could.
This is the best thing I’ve seen on the internet all year !!
Did you impregnate your dog
She doesn't know what's going on but she's glad to be a part of it.
This is actually the cutest thing i have ever seen.
This is the kind of wholesome content the world needs rn😊
Fostering is a lot of work, but so worth it!  I have had the opportunity to foster multiple pregnant cats, but no dogs yet.  I can’t wait to see pics of the pups!
Life goals.
I love it!! Not only are you showing her lots of love but also promoting fostering.  I adopted my big baby about ten minutes into fostering him. Lol. I still continue to foster and I have failed two more times with our kitties. Lol   The shelter or rescues usually provides all food, treats, toys, vet, and training the entire time you foster.   I believe it’s like that at most places. 
I would love to see pictures of your beautiful foster mama with her babies.  So loving these beautiful pictures!!!
The skirt blowing in the wind is so spot-on
Aww that's so cute.

Remember to spay and neuter your pets. Millions of pets die because there's not enough play to take care of them.
I saw your post on the Facebook group too! I’m so happy I got to see it pop up again today
I only have one upvote to give... my baby is a rescue. Would do ANYTHING to keep her safe and comfy.
Oh my god, I love her belly. So cute.
I can’t wait for her gender reveal party to burn down all the seven continents.
Awe, Mama I love you!  My Dingo was a Mom before I attempted to foster her, but that only lasted one hug and it was over we decided we could never be apart.
She’s beautiful
OMG she's glowing!
The skirt in the wind is what got me 🤣
The doctored B&W!!! Hilarious
This is the most wholesome thing I’ve ever seen.
We have 2 fosters at home my gf keeps hoping we find one thats prego
Awe 😭😭😭
i wonder if the baby will look like a human dog hybrid.
OMG I didn't know I needed this in my life!! 

More of these please! And do a gender reveal party sans devastating forest fires.
A bit cheesy .. but when it come to doggo nothings cheesy enough
It’s more like a Pawternity shoot.
It really is 2020 for something like this to be happening
That sonogram picture though😍I had to zoom in to set it.  Super awesome to see this on here.  My friend did a maternity shoot with her cat and my mind was blown at how cute and awesome yet simple it was. Why doesn't everyone do this with their pets?? They deserve to feel like models too!
Hey i saw it on tik tok and she looks so cute🥰
wait is that puppy almost formed
It's nice and all but I hope u don't do a gender reveal and burn half of America again
So the dog is pregnant and the human is the father?
this is weird
White people are so bizarre
Fostering takes an extra big heart! You’re an amazing person with a fun sense of humor! Thanks for sharing.
Omg that ultrasound pic though!
so extra
Damn that’s a lot of free time.
Omg I love this.
AWW
That’s awesome that you did this!
This is so damn cute!!! 😍
So so sweet!! Omg happy pupper happy foster mom 🥰
A DO RA BLE
I’ve never wanted to give someone an award so badly! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This is suuuper over the top amazing cuteness
This is fantastic, why wouldn't this be a thing....Photog's need to get paid and people love their pets!
You are a wonderful human
Did anyone else notice how fake the ultrasound photo is? 
Edit: this is sarcasm people 🤣🤣
So cute 😍😍
#justwhitepeoplethings
Why though?
[removed]
started following on ig and mama is giving birth to puppers as we speak!! 😍😍
The ultrasound make me cackle
Coming from a white person I can confirm that white people spend their money on the darndest of things.
[removed]
[removed]
White people always taking it to the next level lol
She’s beautiful!!🥰
this is so sweet
I needed to see this today. I am content now.
She’s gonna be a good mama
🥺🥰 my heart just exploded. 💐💐 doggie looks so happy💗💝
A maternity shoot? Okay let’s face it, she’s not your ‘foster’ dog anymore,is she?
The ultrasound is amazing
Awwww
🥺😍 omg! Thank you for doing this! Such a beautiful doggie and mama-to-be.
Holy shit this is adorable 😍😍😍😍😍
Beautiful.  And thank you - folks like you make the world so much of a better place:
This is the absolute best!
that's beautiful
Thank you for sharing these and also for giving this sweet girl a home! 💓
lol this is too cute!!!
These are so lovely! My husband and I adopted our sweet girl that was born into a foster home! Do you know how many sweet pups she has in there?!
Yes the dog is also very pretty
Did you burn California down? At best a forest?
Beautiful! This is the true meaning of multiespecie's family. Where's the pride father dog? 🙄
Did the father go buy cigarettes like mine did?
You are the father
Late to the party but this person is amazing. On top of being a great friend, connected me to my rescue dog and helped my fiancé foster (and then adopt) a stray in our neighborhood. And her Instagram is a testament to how much she cares about fostering
Now if that just ain’t the sweetest goddamn thing I’ve ever seen
Looking forward to the gender-reveal party(-ies)
Should have done the cheesy, standing together with your hand on her belly!
What a beautiful mama! Goldens are the best.
You’re a beautiful person. ❤️
Omg this is the best thing ever lol
Zero wildfires started
This is beautiful. Warms my ❤️
Please don’t burn down the forest during the baby shower
This is the best ever!!!!
I seriously thought that was a real ultrasound for a bit there
This is so precious! ❤️❤️❤️
I love this
Without a doubt the best pregnancy photos I've ever seen on Reddit - or any other kind of social media for that matter. What a beautiful mother! :)
Beautiful!
This is the best thing I have seen in weeks. Adorable!
What a proud mama!
Too cute 😊 Thank you for sharing
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen omfg
Zoomed in on that photo. Hilarious!
I was so confused. I’m an RVT and work with both Rads and ultrasound. The photo was loading and a bit blurry.... I’m thinking to myself huh they did an ultrasound (I’ve only seen one reproductive u/s in my career-we always do Rads). Then the image cleared and I died a little. So cute! I’d love to see the rad, OP, to count the little skulls/spines and guess how many pups are coming!!
This would have been a lot weirder 10 months ago.   Right now I'm just looking for my next fix of doing things with as few people as possible while plumbing the depths of what is enjoyable.  You appear to be better at this than I am.  Well done.  I must try harder.
Oh my god I love this
"Foster dog." 

Right up until she wins your heart. 🙂
OMG, this is so freakin’ EXTRA and I love it!!!!
If this we’re the 1950’s, you’d be where they sent teenage lady dogs who were “in trouble.”
Wow in love with this, so friggin cute 😍
I can’t tell if this is satire
The only thing missing is the gender reveal party
This is both cute and the whitest thing I’ve ever seen.
I love her.
It was all cute but the sonogram was absolutely adorable!
Wait... Did she fuck the dog? Or is this adoption? I'm not sure how to ask these questions these days...
Lol the ultrasound
adopt her!!!!! pweeeeze
What does that even mean?
You should have an insta for all this so we can track rhe progess and you could do more funny skits like this :-D
That’s so adorable and sweet ❤️
The best thing I've EVER seen on Reddit!! Love, love, love!!!!
I love everything about this!!
But why is she still your foster surely this amount of love she is your bestest girl ?
It’s cute but where’s the father? Did he go out for a pack of dog cigarettes and never come back or something?
Did... Did they....Oh no...No, please no.
PLEASE DEAR GOD NO GENDER REVEAL !

boy, girl, girl, girl, boy, boy, etc
My wife plans for "Dog maternity photographer" to be her retirement job, so I'm sure she's taking notes!
If you plan to share these, please credit me @caitiesfosterfam. This is actually me and the dog I am currently fostering. She gave birth last night to eight healthy babies ❤️
How high do you have to be to do this?
This is so sweet
This has got to be the sweetest thing I have seen in 2020. Thank you for sharing. Hope all of the puppies arrive safely and find good forever homes. Be well
Wait... there are people on here who think that puppy ultrasound is real?????? My brain hurts.
This is so cute
UPDATE: puppies have arrived! https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/jtrxv4/update_pregnant_dog_with_maternity_pics_gave/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Did you impregnate the dog?
Girl you neeeeed that beautiful dog‼️🐾
This is adorable. Such a cute thing that we don't see often but the ultrasound creeps me out. Is that just a dog cropped in there? Anyway, cute idea. I like how the standing pose shows her little pregnant belly.
This is the cutest thing ever. She looks so happy :)
Foster animals rule
Wot?
This is a lot of work for instagram followers.
White people
The world is becoming a really weird place. But hey, they both look very happy, so kudos
[removed]
Well ain't she glorious!! She looks so happy.
I love this!!
This is just absolutely gorgeous!
Please send more ‘small puppy’ pictures.
Well, that's a first.  

And,

Hopefully the last.
This is the most white girl shit I’ve ever seen 
 
-a white girl
This is weird to me, but whatever makes you happy!

People are odd
This what we doin now?
I want to have this much free time and money one day.
Sorry but find this disturbing and dumb. There are enough dogs in the world without celebrating adding more puppies.
the fuck is wrong with you
Falking reallly??!
I'll take, "things to do when you have too much money, for five hundred, Alex"
Why
[removed]
Lmao that's the most white woman thing I saw today. I bet you dont have children too
A karen and her karen dog.
These photos would be very weird if OP was a man
This is...disturbing.
Really?
KEEP HER!
Now do a gender reveal.
Did anyone else zoom in and notice how suspiciously perfect that puppy is in the picture? Like he’s also posing for the picture?https://i.imgur.com/KH0Qkc9.jpg
Imagine if the human is a guy. Awkward...
Your Pics Look cute tho
Beautiful!  Wish I could be there for the birth!!!
2020 needs wholesome stuff like this. Congrats to the new addition! Here’s to a long life of fun times and the best of health for you all 🙏🏾
You girls are so beautiful! I’m not trying to come off creepy cuz I’m not creepy.

Edit: shit. I sound creepy
Usually shelters try to spay and abort pregnant dogs as to not continue the overpopulating. Surprised they fostered the dog out.
If this isn't the firstmost world, then I don't know what is
This is ridiculous, and more than a little absurd.
I honestly don’t know what else to say.
Clicked to see how this played out here.  Glad to see I am not the only one who is thinking; “What in the fuck?”

Appreciate the reassurance.
Creepy, pregnancy photos... For... A dog? You must be American, right?
Weird.
you know this is a dog right? not a person...
This. This is why the rest of the world thinks Caucasians are freaky
This is the most stupid s*** I have ever saw. I honestly have lost part of my soul and now 20% more stupid.....
What in the world are they putting in those pumpkin spice lattes that make y'all think of think of this weird stuff
[removed]
Will there be a ‘reveal’ party too? 🎉
Yep. I like that.
I think animals should be spayed and Neutered, it breaks my heart when I hear about them, being put down because nobody wants them, or the humane society is being over run etc... With this situation the dog was probably pregnant before she got her, but hopefully she will get her fixed after this...
Reddit be like "omg gender reveals are so stupid" and then do shit like this
White people doing white people things
I love this so much!!!
white people weird, making out with the dog
People are fucking weird
[removed]
mazel tov
This is all kinds of amazing, but that ultrasound fucking makes it!
**beautiful, I've been looking at this for 5 hours now**
HER POOCH :”-)
We are going to need baby pics
That ultrasound. If a puppy actually was just chillin like that omg I think it would legit be the greatest thing I’ve ever seen ever and will ever
Imagine the carnage with all the pyro at the genders reveal party!
Can I have a puppy 🥺
is that a puppy posing in the ultrasound lol.
That’s sweet. My family took in a stray dog. It’s great! 👍🏽
I seriously love cat and dog maternity shoots.
The ultrasound LMAOOOOOO. All round awesome. So cool :)
Aww this is such a cute idea!! I have a foster dog mama who had her babies 6 weeks ago tomorrow and I wish I thought of this!! Good luck with the babies, and don’t forget to pamper mama dog :)
That belly! Awwwww
The pupper in the ultrasound is adorable
Hilarious and awesome!!!
This is too much for my cold heart....it’s actually melting!!! She’s so BEAUTIFUL!
awwowowwwo doggieee
This is the greatest thing I've seen all day!!
Idk if shes a golden retriever or lab, but ID DIE TO LOVE ON HER.. idk how someone could abandon that beauty makes me mad! but, also releived she's safe, warm and happy!
Beautiful Golden soon to be mama.
This is the first pregnancy photo shoot that didn't elicit an eye roll for me! This is amazing!
Our best girl Mocha was taken in by a foster while she was pregnant after she was rescued from a hoarding/puppy mill situation. I’m so glad she had a lovely foster family to care for her when she was so scared and about to have a litter. 2 of her 6 puppies stayed with the family and luckily they are local so we are able to get them together on occasion. You are doing amazing things for that sweet girl!
The ultrasound of the baby puppy is unreal cute.
💖💖💖
She’s glowing!
My god, pleaseeeee adopt this sweet angel for real. You may be the one comfort she keeps from this pregnancy
You're an awesome person, yo!
Omg! Look at her belly!! 😍😍😍
That dog is adorable.
I’ve got a serious question...

DOES THE DOGGY ULTRA SOUND PICTURE ACTUALLY SHOW A LITTLE DOGGY PICTURE? 

😻😻😻
This is the best thing I've seen!
This kind of pictures are such a lovely fantasy to me
No se ingles, te culio el perro o que?
Omg I love this. I wanna shoot pics of pregnant dogs! If I had room I would foster but my apt is too small. ☹️
My god, the wholesomeness of this absolutely crushed me, tearing up over here. Dogs are the absolute best, and I wish all foster parents were as loving as you clearly are. That is one lucky pup... she looks so happy... annnnnnd I’m crying again writing this.

You know that saying that gets tossed around about people not deserving dogs? You might be the exception.
This hella cute tho ngl
Aight this is fun. Just don't do a gender reveal...
She just looks happy to be involved
I’m so happy for you!
Adorable ultrasound picture
Look at her little belly 😍 
She’s a beautiful mama to be
This is adorable
I love you
Everyone liked it👍
this is the best thing i’ve ever seen
Haha the ultrasound
OP, thank you so much for taking care of this sweet girl!
Zoomed in on the ultra sound, was not disappointed
Well... this is the most adorable thing I’ve ever seen.
I am smiling so hard. 😳
Awesome!
Her tail!
Her belly! I love it
Thanks for fostering. She’s totally glorious.
So coot
What a beautiful momma !!!
She’s glowing 😍
She’s a beautiful dog!
This is so fucking cute! I can't imagine being a foster mom because I'd want to keep them all lol. Thanks for being this dogs person for a while, she loves you. ❤️
So sweet! I’m so glad you’re there for the sweetest mama of all. She seems to love you already! It’s great to see fosters bond with their fur babies
Yes to everything about this
This. This is EVERYTHING!
Wow that dog is pregnant as hell!!
This is precious!
Pregnant foster dog
Damm she pregnant af
This made my day🥰
This is precious.
Bottom right photo oh my goodness 🥰 thank you for fostering!!!
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ahhhh a golden!! I've had them growing up. I'm planning on rescuing one from china soon-ish. Such loving dogs.
Aww beautiful! Once my little sassholes grow up and gtfo, I’m going to foster!! I worked at a shelter and Vet clinics for years before I became a SAHM. My passion!
I adopted my cat right after she had her litter and they had all been adopted, we originally wanted one of her kittens but they were all gone by the time we got there, so, we took her instead.
Why?
🤩🥰 lovely 😍
I suspect chicanery with that sonogram.
This is the craziest lady I've ever seen
My god how pure Im so happy
[deleted]
brb, facepalming myself into the next dimension bc my first thought when looking at this was: “Wow, that fetus looks really mature.”
This made my day for real.
wow Icons and legends only
This is the cutest shit ever !
Omg the ultrasound pic is perfect 😂
Holy shoot this is the cutest thing I've ever seen
so cute to see this made my day <3
Omg her wittle belly I can’t 🥺
You are pretty
As my buddy would say, "Whypipo have nothing better goin on in their lives"
I’ve never seen a dog’s ultrasound and thought that it was a real one, until I googled it........
The sonogram photo is sending me to the moon.
I just love that her round belly sticks out just like a human momma when she's standing on her back legs!
Can we have a puppy?
This is so sweet. I can't handle it.
Can't wait for the gender reveal party!
Dogs are truly the mans best friend
One of the cutest things I’ve ever seen
Wow she is just glowing!!
Is that a real ultrasound pic because I’m laughing my ass off at...
Finally! Someone who gets it!!!
I wanna give her treats and pats and tell her how pretty she is
Arnt all dogs foster dogs because I don't you gave birth to it
The ultrasound! LOL
WHERE IS THE FATHER?!
please, just, dont do a fireworks-based gender reveal. please. do not.
I just realized I’ve never seen a pregnant dog before, how cute!
Don't be burning down forest with the gender reveal.
I giggled for 5 min over this.
This is the best thing I have ever seen !!! 

Really brought a smile to my face after such a terrible day at work (cashiers have it hard sometimes LOL) 

So thank you for that . 

Also congrats !!!
The goodest girl 😍
My heart
That sonogram pic tho
Sooo cute
This better be a foster fail! She loves you so much
I can't decide if this is more weird or cute lol
Your dog is beautiful !!  Thank you for adopting
Is that ultra sound fake??
God Golden Retriever people are psycho. I miss my goldens.....sob.
This is the best and only adorable maternity photos.
This is what covid has brought us to, and I love it.
Woah... the dog fetus definitely looks like a dog!
This is adorable. Look at her little belly.
she’s glowing
This is the sweetest thing I’ve seen all day. I’m going through a lot mentally, and this really has brightened my day, thank you ❤️
The "ultrasound" is a work of art
This makes me feel so good!!!
That doggo is a good doggo. I have spoken.
If this is Sydney and they need adoption...
I feel like this will be buried but wanted to take a shot. I fostered two 5 week old puppies as my first fosters a couple months ago and absolutely loved it. I would be happy to take any foster again and am interested in fostering a pregnant mother because I think it would be such a rewarding and challenging experience. Is she your first? If not, any tips for someone looking to foster a pregnant mother?
Adorable!
This is weird and cool in all the ways that count
So are you planning to do a gender reveal party?
How uplifting is this ?
Dad went out to grab a bone.
Cute
OP, we deserve to see the entire album!
The ultrasound photo !!! 😆🥰
This is the only maternity shoot I have ever seen, that is cute.
Bahahha the ultrasound photo got me. Lovely doggos!!
Alright who’s the father
I saw "maternity shoot" and was about to keep scrolling but then saw "dog," and it was as good as I hoped!
She looks so happy! I bet she doesn't even know what's coming next 😨
u/zelderd2077
fOr mY fOsTeR dOg
I want a puppyyyyy
The ultrasound 😂😂🤣🤣
I’m assuming that ultrasound is photoshopped?
I love dog
FINE. TAKE MY UPVOTE!
This is the only maternity shoot I can get behind!
This photo shoot is the cutest thing!!!! So sweet. Im in love
That is very nice you did that for your dog. Congrats for you and your dog 😃
The photo in the sonogram is freaking me out. It's fake right?
Good girl is glowing!
Cute pup! Hey, are you a Hokie by any chance? I noticed the orange and maroon sweater
Hmmm... My golden needs a friend
Long shot, but will the pups be available to adopt? I really want a golden puppy and am willing to travel to you if it keeps them out of the shelter.
When I was pregnant ten years ago, I went in for one of those super cool 4D scans to get a sneak peek of the baby. Well, my images came out less than stellar, they said, because of my placenta’s location. I wanna know who did this cute mama’s scan because they got a hell of a fine image through all that fur.
Adorable!!!!!
I'm crying now.
Why would a Golden need to be fostered? They are such good dogs! I’d never give up a Golden.
You funny
I saw you on dogspotting!
I wanna fucking hug it
she’s glowing ✨
So cute
the ultrasound has cackling lmaoo
I love that you did this ❤️
Budda dawg. Da dog wit da budda on em.
People get rid of goldens?!
You should do a gender reveal.
Farangi bilkul pagal hein
You and the dog look similar
This is the cutest thing ever. 😍
Stupid as fuck but cute
Aye!! I saw the tik tok!!
Added to the list of things I didn’t know I needed to see
I just realized I've never seen a pregnant dog before.
Just please don’t do a gender reveal party, 2020 has had enough fire!
This is adoorable!
Such a QT! The gender reveal should involve her somehow detonating an explosive.
Weird but aww
r/cursedcomments
That ultrasound though, had to zoom in. Nice touch...
What about the maternity boudoir set?
Wait... I don't see no ring on that paw! Harlot
For a second I thought that was a real sonogram lol
The Romans used to write poetry to their dogs
I didn’t realise unborn puppies look so much like born puppies! I expected them to be less developed for some reason. She must be due soon 💜
That dog so i defently love your dog its really cude
If you look closely there's a cute dog
Well okay this is just the cutest thing I’ve ever seen in my entire life.
Wow, that dog really looks prangent.
Tbh I know it's not the point but this just makes me want the pup(s). Probably pumping it(em) full of love and joy for life!!! All because of the love and joy mama felt because of you!

You're awesome. Thanks for being you!
Shit white people do
This is so sooo good 🤣
I can see a great affiliation here and obviously pure love and care too, which we can not find among human beings now unfortunately....!
Nevertheless it’s a great effort
What are you doing step dog?
Cut this, cut that, photoshop in a tie 😂
Beautiful baby!
More of this, please world?
You are NUTS!!!

And I love it! You're both such beautiful beings!
just don't go setting off fires for the big gender reveal, otherwise, d'awwww
oh thank fuck i read the title. i saw the pic w/ ultrasound and thought you were carrying the dog's child (like a post in r/holup or r/darkjokes) lmao
congratulations but WHo is the fAtHeR?
That dog looks healthier than 50% of Americans right now
If that was a guy this picture won’t be seen the same way
Karen things done right
Please tell me there will also be newborn pics! I need more of this in my life right now!
She is radiant
Why did you fuck the dog?
Ngl the ultra sound is cute and funny lol
somethings wrong i can feel it
This is the whitest thing I’ve ever seen
The way those pictures are taken, one could think you had a part in the conception...
Are these people real?
Guynacolcogist
Damn, white girls actually fuck dogs for real
Ha ha this a gender reveal I will like to see
This is so cute I almost cried 😭
This is too adorable!!
Koji ste vi moroni
you can tell by her boots, we're in for another massive forest fire.
why
Wait, did she fuck a dog?
Ar you sure that the puppy in her belly looks like that in the sonar pic..? :D
 Idunno man, seems kinda fotoshop to me..
Very cute, but with the wrong person, this can become r/cursedcomments
Women are so extra 😂
 zoom into that ultra-sound
Awww, look at her cute preggo belly! 😍
Weird, but I still liked it.
Who is the father
làm màu vãi lồn bro
Awwww xddd
some people love animals like a family it's much appreciated.
I feel crazy..  I didn't expect the ultrasound photo to look like a puppy, I guess I expected it to look more like a group of aliens not straight up a puppy's face. 🤣  someone tell me if I'm crazy.
Cuteness overload.
Such an amazing moment.
Pair of gorgeous girls 🥰
WGFD
I love this too much!
Awwww this made my day
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph this is fucking AWESOME!!!!!
I don’t know if I’ve ever loved any Reddit post more in my life.
Congratulations 🎊
What a beautiful dog!
upcoming soul he or she?
Cursed wedding
For a moment i believed the dog is the father lol
Looking forward to the gender reveal party
Incredibly precious!!!! ♥️♥️
I love this!!!   We foster as well and they are special pups.  We will be picking up our 21st foster of the year today.
Love this !!
What a beautiful couple 😋
Do I want to know who’s the father?
So she is having the dogs child? Fuck the future is weird
Awww adorable
Pls don't do a gender reveal
Now this is what youtube needs on trending.
Oh I honestly though she was pregnant with the dog for a second there
If she doesn’t get a puppy shower I’m going to ve very upset
This is so weird. But definitely awesome.
The flower crown was a perfect touch.
Did she fuck the dog?
A whole new level
The dog is carrying her child ??
Fostering dogs caused my parents to divorce
Pure genius!
This is quite literally the best thing I’ve ever seen in my life.
That dog is absolutely gorgeous
this is deeply disturbing.
every pregnant dog should do this !
This woman celebrates her dog’s birthday. I love dogs but this type of thing is so annoying to see.  
decent [can dogs have canned chicken noodle soup](https://petcare4all.com/dogs/can-dogs-eat-canned-chicken/)
I dont get it?
This dog living a better life than me hahahahahahahah
Dogs licking your face is gross
Please don't let dogs lick your face. Before you know it you'll have roundworms :)
gender reveal ?
I love everything about this. I hope this is a foster failure and you end up together forever❤
Thanks for taking care of her, please get her spayed as soon as possible after she gives birth. Good luck.
🤔🤷🏼
I confused the words foster and surrogate for a moment.

Thought 2020 had a new one for me for a second...
I officially have diabetes. : )
Mildly disturbing
man those are gonna be some weird kids.
For one second i thought its the lady got pregnant from the dog
This is so American lol

Ok this is too precious for life
Adorable idea!
She's glowing lol so cyute.
I downvoted this by accident and then got mad at me for doing it. "Come on dude!  WTF! This is the most adorable dog/human pic ever!  Why'd you downvote it?" 

 "I told you! I didn't mean to!"  You know a true dog lover when you see something like this. Thanks for doing it and sharing.
What the.........ugh

Single mom? Who knocked that bitch up?
Do not ever force your dog to stand on their hind legs even with support. Their joints will get damaged and they won't be able to walk in their senior years. Sure it's cute but don't hurt your dogs
Forcing the dogs into doing something that humans want? How cruel
My god I hate pregnant women. So obnoxious. Gift of life blah blah blah....

Pregnant dogs on the other hand....

*makes this screenshot phone background*
The dumbest thing I’ve seen in a long time.
People are weird

When humans do this, I think it is mildly annoying...but a soon-to-be mama pupper? This is absolutely beautifully adorable. Now this has my maternal juices going
[removed]
This might be the best thing ever!
Will the puppers be up for adoption? If so, what breed(s)?
When is the gender reveal?
u/BRlANA
I’m fucking SOBBING
I didn't read the text before looking at the pictures and I was so confused...

Used* dog
thought they were a couple for a second
I hope i dont come off as weird but shes pretty well pretty, the human was okay i guess
Did... did she really do that to the dog?
This would've been received very differently had the human been a man
Oh god I hate my mind..
White girls need to stop with this shit
What the fuck is a foster dog.
Plz adopt this cute dog

That dog should get an abortion.

Foster dog?  So a dog then lol

Is it pregnant or did she just eat another dog whole? Lol tf is with that ultrasound 😂
Does anyone else notice there's something odd about the upper right pregnancy picture??
Ooh a southern girl
at first I thought the dog was a guy and... you know what I'll be quiet
Is it fucked up that I first thought she got impregnated by a dog?
Why not just use a dog prenatal xray? Why the creepy fake ultrasound?
Ok this was fucking great.
At first i thought they where pregnant together
This, uhh... looks like a maternity photo for you and your dog...
Why is that dogs baby bump cuter than mine?
I never knew dogs could type.
Isn't every pet a foster pet? Or can people give birth to other species now? I've not been watching the news.
Fuckin Ew.
I was going to comment that when people do this type of stuff and post it, it’s not ever for the dog, and is only about the person wanting attention, but then I saw OP stating it was to help encourage people to foster more, and I couldn’t have been more wrong.

Edit: Damned if you do, damned if you don’t?
This is the whitest thing possible.  I love it.

Very cute! Although...I can’t help but wonder how awkward it would seem if the owner was a man haha.

God this is one of the things I love about western culture. I'd probably be a Public pariah if I did that back home.
It'd look totally weird if a guy was replacing her lol
Aww? More like eww.
What a dumbass thing to do. It's a fuckin dog.
Where is the dad?  Did you neglect him?  :)
Saw this and genuinely thought you made the baby with the dog, and that made me concerned
I hope that you either adopt the dog that you're fostering now, or  you adopt one (or more) of her puppies
If you don’t read the title it looks like she’s celebrating getting knocked up by her dog
Where the puppy daddy???
This is something only white people would do
