r/DisneyEyes
Don't say that, I'm sure he is a very good dog.

Through my eyes the dog looks like CGI, It looks so cute!
"That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!!" 
-Todd Sanchez
Jinkies, he's cute 😍
#PUPPY POWER!

Looks like a really good CGIed Scrappy.  Not like the horrible Smurfs movie with Neil Patrick Harris. 

Ta-ta-ta-daaa!
*My resolve not to give treats*: Ruh-Roh
Fuck scrappy but this little shit is cute
As much as Scrappy gets a lot of hate from the fans, I actually enjoyed him in the 13 Ghosts Of Scooby Doo Series
What breed is he?
That has got to be the most handsome puppy i have ever seen
But how is it ok to be running around being this adorable?
Omfg soooo cute!!!!!! What breed of dog is this? I’m currently looking for a dog and this cutie is perfect? Thanks in advance to all who answer!!
[removed]
Lemme at em, lemme at em! So I can pet him!

Lemme at ‘em!!
ruttrowraggy
This is too perfect to be a real doge...
Shopped?
Beautiful dog 🐕❤😍
Why? Everyone hated Scrappy
But Scrappy Doo was a jerk. 
Cute dog though.
The most innocent face!
**I want**
Goodness gracious me!
Scrappy doo has been found dead in miami
Shame Scrappy is the most disliked character in the franchise
Ruh Roh!....
Poor dog....no dog should be compared to Scrappy-Doo
That is overload cute! My god!
Bro give scooby  a scooby snack  look at his eyes he want a Scooby snack.
What type of dog is this?
I'm so torn here.  On the one hand, he's adorable and that name is great.  On the other hand, fuck Scrappy Doo.
I cannot believe how goddam ADORABLE this puppy is.  I squeed hord.  Kiss him so much, okay?
This is the picture next to puppy in the dictionary. This is the puppiest puppy I've ever seen
Forget Scrappy Doo. What you have is a pup named Scooby Doo
Which scrappy we talking scooby movie or cartoon
Rappy Roooo!
Da cutest pupper!!!
Cute
So
Fucking cute!!!!!
You better watch out. That one looks innocent, but I predict a lot of trouble headed your way.
What breed is that puppy ?
Better than the original!
Ruby ruby roo
Rappy Roo?
This one is actually cute!
cute dog, but scrappy doo was a fucking asshole
How many of these little guys are there out there?
#this cutie looks like a hyper-realistic render and I love him
He's cuter than Scrappy Doo.
Scooby-doo RTX on edition
He looks like a CGI dog!
He’s cute but he needs a diamond shaped collar ☺️
This dog is so cute that it looks fake / CGI.
That’s the cutest puppy I have ever laid eyes on
Scrappy Doo could never!

He looks like a good boy and deserves Scooby snacks 💗
Oh my god I can’t handle this level of cute 😭
Don't you dare leave him on the side of the road. He's adorable.
I'm sorry
Are we sure this isn’t AI generated to create the cutest dog imaginable ?
That is a beautiful dog and an incredibly sharp photo.
I've never met this dog but I love him unconditionally
Almost looks like an animatronic puppy! I keep expecting him to start talking!

What a cutie!
Remember Eagles love Scrappy Doos too
ruh roh
You forgot the blue collar
Does he have puppy power?
Oh my god, my life is complete now ❤️🥺😍
He is super cute!
I actually liked scrappy. Not the knock offs he engendered but the original at least.
I’d imagine this is how Scooby-Doo would look like as a puppy - cute and innocent - until he met Shaggy Rogers and got influenced to the grown-up Scooby lol
Lol!! For a sec I read that as derpy doo
Is he evil?! Scooby Doo the movies makes him out to be pretty dawg gone evil.
My friend has a dog and his name is Scooby and I swear when I saw ur dog I died
What a cute dog💜
Is this CGI?
So adorable.
he is too cute !!
Is this the most perfectly cute puppy? Like others have said, it looks so cute that it looks CGI!
I love them❤❤
Look at those little eaws 🥺

Overall a good pup Rn 10/10
Ok this was the first thing I saw when I opened reddit and I wasn't ready.
Let’s name him dogecoin
Whats new scooby doo
Careful he doesn’t end up in an animatronic Mr. Bean and try to steal the souls of the narly guests on Spooky Island
Our dogs look almost identical this is so weird, what breeds???
The cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Precious!   Good luck with your pup!
Your pup just won the internet for today. Everyone go home now it's over.
Let me at em! Let me at em!
Precious!!
LIKE ZOINKS, SCOOOOB
I’m in love.
Awwwwe
He's got a big head. Call him Baldwin or Travolta.
🥺🥺🥺
TIL there is a Scrappy Doo.
 So adorable, Was he adopted with this name? We adopted a dog who’s name is also Scrappy Doo! I’m biased but I also think he’s pretty cute 😉
Please make an Instagram for this puppy so I can live vicariously through you, thank you
*... and Scrappy too!*

Oh man, I look forward to singing this theme song in my head all day today.
Waarfoo!!!!!
geebus that's one photogenic dog
His face actually looks cartoonist 😍
OH MY GOD
Got yourself one good lookin’ pup there.  Give them a snacco on me.
Cute dog very bad name choice cause he is the forbidden one
Time to steal him
Isnt he the bad guy?
Cuteness level over 9000
What up scrap.. Scooby snacks in the back.. bathroom just past the doggie door to the left..
He's so cute, I would like to punt him across a football field!
What a handsome little guy
Yes this sweetie , is adorable.
The perfect doggo
Serious puppy power!
Scooby-Doo is my favorite..
He looks very cartoonish, super adorable ❤️
Aww cutie
The cutest face
I love him. Can anyone tell me what breed he is?
there is no way a puppy that cute can be as fking annoying as scrappy doo
I'm sorry, but just hearing the name scrappy doo makes me feel sorry for the dog, and I love dogs. But, scrappy doo is one of the worst cartoon characters in history.
Stuff it while it's still cute
Holy shit, this is a real dog?!
He is precious 🥺
Let me at ‘im!  Let me at ‘im!!!
Scrappy Dappy Dappy Dooooo!!!
He is very cute
If someone said this was cgi i would believe them xD
Looks more like Scrappy Doo
That dog is so in focus it almost looks like cgi. Amazing.
That is small Scooby Doo, we do not speak of Scrappy
Isnt scrappy the annoying one that nobody really likes cause hes not a good dog....

Scooby is the real MVP
He reminds me so much of my pup Jack.  Jack was 9 years old and we had to send him to his final sleep yesterday after his surgery failed.  Pet those ears for me please.  That’s a good boi.
Let me at him lemme at him!
What did he do to deserve being compared to Scrappy?
Ew don’t compare your dog to Crappy Doo
Scrappy is adorable. Please pet him for me.
Omg that's so cute? What breed is he (or she idk)?
Very nice. What kind of dog is he?
He's so cute! I hope he isn't as annoying as Scrappy, though.
Cute puppy but it's not a great Dane
so cute
The way I remember things scrappy was a dick
No scrappy don’t
Don't call your dog scrappy doo. That's just cruel. Scrappy was by far the most hated character in that series. Call him a baby scooby
Why would you insult your dog so?
I fuckin hated that piece of shit.
Impossible.

I don’t believe it.


[My god.](https://cdn.americasfavpet.com/e130a2fac2b6017e6a799a7f796e6d62200f3856.jpeg)

If he really is like scrappy doo you’ll be PUNTING HIM ACROSS THE YARD
Breed?
Is there a sub for cartoon dogs in real life?
Looks weird
[Don't let him pee on you on road trips.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia8LqyDsdbo&t=91)
Im stealin him lol
My mom’s dog, Jack, looks similar to Scrappy Doo. I call him such, as he also has a teal collar like SD!
What breed is he?
Alright put up your dukes.
Scrappy Doooooooooooooooo
That's a real dog?

Blacking out his name for pricacy, respect!

Cutest dog I’ve seen in awhile. What’s the breed?

He’s so cute, I’d put my hand in a blender if he looked me in the eyes and asked me too.
Awww such a cute pup 🥰🥰🥰
That is a very cute,"Scrappy Doo".
What type of dog is that??
Let me at em, let me at em!

I always been a firm believer that if you have a heart and soul of a fighter, no one can stop you.

Remember boys and girls, size don't mean shit if you don't have the heart and soul of a fighter.
Now that a beautiful doggy.
He is adorable..I just wanna cuddle him.
Must... cuddle... face! AWWWWWWW
Please name him Dogecoin.
Goodness!
Careful. Don’t let him absorb a bunch of souls on spooky island.
Awww he is adorable❤️❤️ not scrappy at all.
I refuse to believe this isn't a CGI.
What a cute little face! 🥰
Make sure you actually bring him on mystery Inc cases or he is going to get a massive ego, steal people’s souls, and try to take over the world.
How can anyone look at that face and have the nerve to say they aren't into dogs!?
Little Scrappy Doge
Puppy power
Omg so sweet looking. Almost looks like CGI! You are lucky to have this baby. We need future updates too!
The fact that they had to go out of their way just to retcon Zombie Island deeply saddens me.
I give you the cute doggo award
As cute as this dog is I can’t help but think of scrappy doo from the live action movie, goddamn that version scrappy doo was an asshole
My dog just at my rotisserie chicken... have fun
Enjoy the “puppy power” part!
Nothing against your dog, but FUCK S"crappy" Doo. One of the most absolutely hateable POSs I have ever had the unfortunate timeline to share with. Again, your dog is cute, but FUCK SCRAPPY DOO!
Is this real? He’s a lookalike!
That's Scrappy Doo right there!!
Awwww🐶🥺
Such a cute pupper. Definitely a good boy.
May wanna call an animal talent agency with that beauty.
That guy is an asshole
Awww, is he up for adoption?
Do you know what breed this dog is?
It’s so cute it looks fake
Scooby scooby do i see you pretendin you got a sliver. Youre not foolin me cuz i can see the way you shake and shiver. And scooby doo you got a mystery to solve so scooby do be ready for you’re act, dont hold back.  And scooby do if you come thru youre gonna have yourself a scooby snack, thats a fact.  Scooby scooby do where are you youre ready and youre willin. If we can count on you, scooby do, i know we’ll catch that villain.  This is the second half of the original scooby doo cartoon intro song
🔫

What a handsome dog!
Zoinks!  I hope he's behaving.
Super adorable

He’s gorgeous! Treat him well!
Weren't Scooby and Scrappy great Danes?
I love him!
Zoinks
This pup is exactly how I picture the default storybook-style pup to look like 😭
I usually hate scrappy doo with a passion, but this is an exception
What an adorable puppy
Is the nose wiggling or that just me
Hide him from Tim Curry!! Tim Curry HATES Scrappy Doo
OMFG.... It's adorable
Get that puppy a teal collar NOW.
that's a good looking pupper
He's gorgeous.
So freakin’ cute!
Look at that perfect face, my goodness!!

This dog looks CGI. So cute.
Well... Scrappy Doo turned out to be the villain in the end so good luck I guess. (cute dog though)
Cutest dog ever! I wanna roll on the floor with him!
So cute!!!
So cute 🥺
I love him. You love him. Everybody loves him.
The villain from the scooby doo film confirmed.
It looks like he comes right out of a Disney cartoon
LET ME AT EM

Lemme at him!
So sick of everyone pushing doge
AAHHH, so everyone hates him.

Ruh-roh!
The case of Who Stole My Heart
Puppy power!!!
Forget all these negative comments.   Focus on the adorable puppy!
That is so cute! Please do not name it scrappy. Or rather, name it whatever you want, who am i?
This is the better version of scrappy doo
How can we make it so that when you boop a snoop it upvotes?
PUPPY.....POWER!!  But as we all know, scrappy got into some mess!
“Lemme at em, lemme at em!” He is too cute :)
Awwww...so ...awww love can't wait to own one but where I live in not allowed...that's why I want my house...I really miss my best friend shicka..
He’s perfect
Scooby dooby doo were are you
Cuteeee
Cute dog but like every brown dog looks like scrappy doo
My condolences (/s)
That’s awesome!
Scrappy Doo has been found dead of a crack overdose in Florida
That's a very rude thing to say about a dog.
Let me at’em! I’ll splat’em!
Ahhhhhh its so dam cute!!
What did this beautiful dog do to you that you called him scappy doo.  No dog deserves this.  Maybe a puppy named scooby doo.  But scrappy?  No!
Ruhhh rowwww shaggy
What breed is this?  He is so cute!
But does he piss all over everything?
Why does this look like the best cgi ever done lol
Oh my!  What a beauty!
Where Scooby at?
Those eyes 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 too much
He looks like my newborn nephew when he wants to rip of my hair. Thats cute
OMG he looks so perfect I thought Hollywood was making a CG Scooby DOO film and I was like "Wait I didnt know they were doin a new Scooby Doo mov-OMG THAT PUPPER IS REAL"
Heart melting
Your soooo cute I gave you All my silver 🐾💙
So cute!!
He's a beauty, don't be convinced if he tells you it was because of those pesky kids.
He only cute for 3 months 🙃
Lemme at ‘em Uncle Scoob! I’ll moidelize ‘em!!
Pop
Stock pick of the month. 

MNKD & CTYK

Expect big gains. Been running big the past week. Just the beginning.
Just came here to say: OMG. My heart hurts. I want to eat this pupper, he is so cute. Enjoy him! What a lucky pup.
I want that dog but I want to get my thing straight...I M like in blurr I is this all true...everything is it's real...and if so I need to meet with someone...
SO CUTE
Looks like my hound when she was a puppy! Chihuahua jack Russell cross... what’s yours?
OMG! Adorbs!!
Speedy boy🙄
Being that adorable should be a crime.
That face is irresistible! 😍💖😍
I thought Scrappy Doo was a universally hated character
Adorable 🥰
I too have a Scrappy Doo- i hope your Scrappy brings you tons of joy,  and you too him. 

Here's my Scrappy (and Scooby) Doo 
http://imgur.com/gallery/wwY5RTD
He is adorable.
Simply adorable
Unlike the real scrappy doo, yours is lovable
What are you talking about? This pupper is so much cuter than Scrappy Doo it's just not even a fair contest. 12/10 for head-pat-ability
Aww, what a lil sweetie. The pup will be your hero!
Scrappy doo being a villain in the movie really annoyed me
Okay but what is he????
He is absolutely darling!!
Ruh roh! Hide your pillows!
Beyond adorable...Better stock up on Scooby Snacks and keep the food delivery company's on speed dial <3
Oh, he’s darling.
So adorable!
The most hated of all the Scoobs... 

But seriously, yours is adorable!
Scrappy was always super smug. It was off putting. Your pup seems nice and probably incapable of smugness. At least as a defining character trait anyway.
I had a dog named Scrappy, and unfortunately he passed away in October.
What kind of dog it is perfect
Too bad everyone hates scrappy
So cute 🥺
Just uh... Don't let it go anywhere near a velociraptor...
If I was considering adopting a pet and the person at the shelter told me this dog was named after that cancerous chicken hawk rip-off, I'd leave without a pet.
Not at all surprised this is approaching 100k upvotes...
He's lovely! 🐾
Awww... Lemme at him! Lemme at him!
[use it please](https://www.scentbird.com/r/d/scentbirduser11549471)
So sweet
What breed is this cure pupper?
I approve ‼️
Awesome! Do u know his breed?
For like 2 months. Lol. And lol... 😞
Nice CGI
You know I'm one of the movies that dog is evil right 😅
Your dog is a lot better than Scrappy Doo.
Let me at em let me at em
Such purity in eyes.i just love it❤️
That nose needs booped
Watch him closely. We all know how scrappy ended up
Omfg protect him at all costs
🥺 love those eyes 🥺
So cute!! ❤️
Absolutely adorable!
Adventure awaits his cute furry self
Scrappy Cornelius Doo 😭😭
Congratulations on your very own fuzzy boi. He's adorable! 

Am I the only person who found Scrappy-Doo to be maybe the most annoying cartoon character in the history of animation?
Unbelievable!
I know it a little late for this, but since this blew up. Would you guys mind voting for Reese in a couple of contests?!

What a ridiculously photogenic dog.
Zoinks.

This pup has model potential.
Cute
haha he looks like scooby as a puppy!
Kiss that gorgeous little face!!
"Puppy Power"- Scrappy
Mom, can we watch scooby doo?

No, we have scooby doo at home

Scooby doo at home: scrappy doo
Not Scrappy Do. Actually cute.
Swear on everything my dogs name is Scrappy Doo Pupperton III
Such an amazing picture! Its so high quality I thought it was 3d rendering for some reason, and u have one hell of a cute dog congrats
What a good boy!
What a good boy!
How amazing and cute this is 🤗😊
nyc dog
Is this picture heavily photoshopped or something?
He is a Great Dane tho
You better make some money off this pup. Needs to be in commericials. Just don't let it get to his/her head when they make it big time. Do they have doggy auditions?
is this even a real dog?
u/Pharaoh_misa
I got a silver award for free and I don’t want to award it to this because I know it deserves gold
This puppy is much cuter than Scrappy.
Oh no. Puppy power! *Pisses aggressively*
Oh wow. That’s CUTE.
fuck scrappy doo
I really hope this one's better.
Adorable dog! Too much Scrappy hate in this comment section though. The movies with him, Shaggy, and Scooby were pretty fun to watch as a kid.
This is adorable
HIS EYES.
Sorry if someone already asked, but what kind of dog is he?
Cutest thing ever
❤❤🐾🐾❤❤
Wtf, he looks so animated, but he's not 🤯
Ok. I'll admit that I always Hated Scrappy Doo. Loathed him.

But this dog is just perfect. They should model a stuffed toy after him.
My family judged me for over writing the VHS end of the first cgi scooby movie for Spiderman and friends. As an adult i screwed up but I'd rather watch Spiderman and friends for the end of the first cgi scooby movie. Yonks.
I need me a pretty pupper like this
Do not say that name.

That's a dog to cute too be that
Can he talk? like "shaaggi"
So percious 💕
I would die for this dog
Daaaawwww.....
RUH ROH!
Jfc that is a damn cute pupper
Aww, look at theae big innocent eyes.
Oh yeah they pretty look a like he just need to become more healthy
Omg so cute
Except this one is nearly impossible to hate. AWWWWWWWWW
Poor doggy
he really does look like scrappy, but less of a troublemaker.
What breed is it? Very very sweet looking pup!
Except he’s an Angel and Scrappy Doo is a little shit
Thought this was his ding dong for a sec.
He was the smarter one.  So all good.
What breed is he
This looka like it would be a RTX Enabled Version of scrappy doo!
Scrappy doo was universally hated. A super annoying side kick know it all type? Ugh.
I do not like scrappy doo but I like this dog
Ruh Roh Rooby.
The most precious creature to exist.
Beautiful and fluffy dog
Keep him away from any soul-stealing devices!

For a minute there I mistook his right hind leg for a strange little penis.
Omg what breed(s) is this?

Scrappy Doo is not a puppy. He is the same breed as Scooby (Great Dane) but he has a development defficiency that doesn’t let him grow.

Scrappy Doo is the worst cartoon character ever. What a horrible thing to name your dog
