I've got one that likes to roll herself up in my blankets. Cute as a kitten. Last night she took half the damn blanket. Less cute, but it's the life I have chosen.
What happened? Why am I unzipped?
Does your dog get jealous? I feel like she does hahaha
That cat was in there a long time.
"Shut the door!!" 😻
I wish I had an award to give you! This is too cute!
This is how my kitten still behaves. Let her sleep on my chest a bit too much when she was younger, and now I cant lay down without her butt and tail, all up in my face
I don't know who's cuter, you or the cat!
Very attractive quality in a man. The cat is cute as well.
From mini-floof to mega-floof

I wish I knew what my boyo looked like as a pup. Got him when he was a few years old. Posts like this gimme an [idea, though.](https://i.imgur.com/fco5eUe.png)
Awwwww 🥰
Congrats on your cat pregnancy.
Gotta proof your dough!!!
man, you'd be my friends exact doppleganger if he wasnt a drunk and took care of himself
Precious! So snuggly!
When I showed cats, in 4h there was a "category" where they wanted to see you with your cat and the "chemistry".. i had a ragdoll at the time who did this, he burrowed into my sweatshirt and every time the judge talked to me he would peak his dead out(out of the neck hole) to look at the judge then cuddle back in when I talked.. I ended up winning best in show that year.. I miss that kitty with my whole soul
So adorable I could cry
Omg I’m in love with your cat 🐱
It's good he finally let the cat out.
Are they looking for a cat mom?!
So.. 9 month later..?
Quaiiiiid.   Open your miiiiiiind
This guys beard is Majestic I mean cat is cute as well
Haha that's a big boiii!!!!
Love this 💝 Snuggly buddies 4 lyf
He looks like that meme guy: [https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yes-chad](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yes-chad)
Mine lays on my neck at night, because that's what I let him do when he was a lil kitty <3
Oh my, I remember seeing the original posted. Looks like your baby really fluffed up!
OH MY GOSH I WANT A CAT TO DO THIS TO ME I COULD DIE OF WHOLESOMENESS
I can't blame him I would do the same thing 😉
TWO cuties 😍
Love this!💟

Is there a r/ for big men with small animals? Sign me up
My little dog loves to cuddle up with me inside my jacket when it gets cold.
Looks like the scene from Alien.
… I miss my cat :(
Sir if you could just stop being this hot for just a minute
It not a tumor....
"Hey zip me back up dad" lol He's so cute
That's literally the chad guy
That’s a nice fucking kitty.
The look on the face at the end is like “what’s going on? We getting up?”
Cutest shit I’ve ever seen
We giggled in our house, thank you.
Do you think cats assume they're crawling into our skin?
Open your mind!
Awwww! I love this so much!
Ah! It’s Tsar Nicholas II and his pet Cat!
The very first picture I have of my cat is her sticking her head out from inside my hoodie. She's a lot bulkier now, but still tries on occasion.
A vast increase in fluff! Congratulations!
Same eyes…
if I could I would give you the Ternion All-Powerful Award
Give bubbles his kitty back
❤❤❤❤
Hi, how are you doing
What a pretty fucking cat.
The human looks like the cat! 🐈
Do you buy your hoodies a few sizes bigger so that your kitty cat fit?
ZIP HIM BACK UP RIGHT NOW 😡
Omg your profile is full of cute videos
![gif](giphy|xUA7aMVj3r6KkKdFg4)
Can I be the cat?
Omg he was in there a very long time /s
The cat poked its head out like, why did you expose me. Lol
Mini kitty
Wut
Nice
Awwwwwww
I like cats that share blankets
I'm not sure how to tell you this, but it appears you have shrunk.
I love how in the second picture you can see him spilling out all over the place haha 

Also: first pic "I need my Daddy, I need to feel safe, okay I feel safe"

Second pic "I BEG your pardon, why are you unzipping me, servant?"
I gather the cat ate half his beard and grew a lot from the nourishment
Jesus how long did you leave it in there for
This must suck during summer 😂
I want to marry your beard.
I like the matchy-matchy 🔥🔥
Omg I'm getting chest sweats just watching this
I will have both of them please
The two gingers…nice!
I don't think what's more attractive than men loving cats imo
I just wanna be loved like that tbh
Man, ALIEN movies sure have soften their act!
NGL i will do the same cause he is Hot AF
Actually how it started: “I don’t want a cat!”
The shock when he opened the hoodie
I was honestly expecting Chelsea to be under the hoodie
r/mensmittenwithkittens
Lucky. My boy used to let me hold him like a baby while he slept and now he won't sit on me at all! He'll sit next to me, but not snuggle on me. 😞 He's too grown up for cuddles now. 😭
Little guy is big now
Oh, my heart! What a glorious ginger puff.
She looks so surprised when you unzip!
Marry me.
Oh god my orange cat is like that too! Doesn’t matter if I have my laptop on me or even another cat, he just jumps up on my chest, lays down to where I have to hold him or he’s gonna fall off, and he’ll just want to lick my whole entire face. Sometimes he gets so excited for attention he bites my nose 😬
I want to be that cat
What breed is that
Bruh your chest hair is out of control(((REAL TALK)))
Haha, so comfy! We’d love to post this on our social channels, let us know if you’d be interested! 😸
im having a terrible day, thanks for cheering me up
both of you gained weight
Does anyone know what type of cat this is?

love the cat.
u single?
How do I know this guy cares about his face more than the cat.
Don't ever let your kitten/puppy get in the habit of doing something that you wouldn't want them to do when they reach full size. For example, don't let a large breed dog puppy sit on your lap unless you want it doing it as a full grown adult.
What a beautiful kitty - those eyes!
❤️ good stuff. Real wholesome.

So sweet
This would be me if I wasn't so damn allergic to cats.
Looks just like my kitty. 😢
I want your sweaters
Oh I love him! ❤️❤️

Why did you let the warm out?
A warm ginger floof!

Gingers are special.  <3

Such a poser, fuck him

Introducing the wearable incubation jacket, from kitten to cat in 60 seconds or your money back! Disclaimer: Process can't be reversed no refunds for attempting to do so. Might not work with other animals but you can try, large dogs could cause you to be over encumbered.
Same eyes…
It’s clearly going well….
I don't know what his name is, but I would call that cat "The Floof"
Sir, you seem to have a very large growth there. 
Where can I get one?

Old habits never die...this cat has its comfort zone. So cute!
Kitty! How adorable.
Awww
I completely expected the adult cat to pop up and I still awwwwwed in cuteness.
Awwwwwwliens
I love that when you unzipped him he looked around like ‘what’s going on’ and then found the camera
The cutest chest buster ever
Living the dream with cat cuddles.
The end gives me Alien vibes. :D such a fluffy chestburster
Cute!
Is this the foster failure guy?
I want a cat.
We did it boys. We found the giga Chad and his pet
ABSOLUTELY ENVIOUS! Wish my cat did that
Why not get a bigger sweater
I really thought the guy was gonna be climbing in the cats coat
Haha awwww mr fluffy fluffersson 🥰

I have a kitten boy just like that. 4 months old.  I bottle fed him from when his eyes opened.  He like to be under the covers when I sleep.  Does two paw taps and I lift the blanket.  Can't wait for him to be a big boy.  

We have dogs that do this too and we call them "portable heaters"
Gotta love a guy who loves cats.
You left him in too long. It's 98.6 degrees for one hour!
beautiful
I just died. RIP.

❤️
Too precious!
Wtf, where did you find my cat?
Orange kitties are the best kitties
Relationship goals.
Am I crazy or does this person look like Luther from umbrella academy??
Cats like “ Hey hooman!!! I didn’t say you could heckin unzip your hoodie!!” lol
Why doesn’t mine do this 😩
Is your name Liam?
He’s super cute
Dad, why you open the window?
what an absolutely ADORABLE chestburster!!!
Mine does that too. It's a great thing
I need this in my life!
Cutest Chest burster
Oh my goodness your kitty is mine's doppelganger!
Wait isn't that Luthor and shouldn't he be on the moon right now. Lol
Wtf do people do to get cats like that? I have 2 cats and none of them cuddle me like that
Cat. Cat never changes.
Currently snuggling one of those too, lol
Why must allergies exist
This is so perfect 💖
Oops when did I get pregnant

This is very concerning, as a guy
I still fits!!
Man, I miss having a cat. It helped with my loneliness a lot.
**MEOW MEOW Ni*A**
What breed is it?
When my floofy cat is hiding he also always forgets his tail is hanging out of his hiding spot, just like this floofy boi
the sweetest little cuddle butt
♥️
The beard and the fur color match!
That’s his house now
Wonder if he ever forgets the cat is in there.
Goals
This is so precious 😻😻💕💕
Ah yes, baking
Congratulations. It’s a cat!
Ginger man with ginger cat. So sexy
Man kept him in there that long :/
I remember your first video. So glad it's going well
This man is living the dream
And dude is hot and have ginger kitty cat?! Slay.
I want a cat like that, I know you're not supposed to adopt kittens or whatever and you should get older cats instead but I want this animal to **imprint** on me.
Did this cat get recruited with a Zip
Is it possible to learn this power?
Soooo cuuuute …cat.
He kinda looks like tsar Nicolas tbh
You kinda look like Andy Samberg
This may be the hottest thing I've ever seen
That may has been in there a while
Welcome to the club.. proud owner of a daddy's girl kitty.
I FELT cat's confuzzled sleepy look. So sweet!
Anyone else’s ovaries hurt in a good way? This is just adorable

Things started out the same way for me and my little Pitbull pup . The difference now though is I am not allowed on the bed .
🥺🥺🥺
You look like Number One from Umbrella Academy
I acted like a happy little kid when OP unzipped their sweater to reveal an adorable kitty, i literally said "ooh a kitty!" Out loud. Thank you for making my day better :)
Damn its all good we all put on a bit extra during covid
 the mandolarian or boba fett?
Wow I think our cats could legitimately be twins. Thank you for the glimpse of what ours may have looked like as a tiny kitten, she was already six months old when we adopted her and past this tiny phase 😭
Your so handsome
Ginger Dad, Ginger Baby!
Poor cat how long was he stuck in that jacket?
Animals are showing interesting tastes nowadays.
Mine does this too! She's about 15lbs now 😂
Fermented cute
Where did you get the first hoodie/flannel sweater?
So it started with him and his kitty. Now it’s him and his kitty and his partner.
OP, that kitter adores you!
Awwwwww!!!
Oh shit it's that guy from badminton like a year and a half ago.
Awwww that looks so warm!! I want a turn…
I'd say it's going very well good sir.
It’s a Norwegian forest cat?
He's cute id do that with him too
the cat is actually attached to his body he is a mutant from Total Recall
Kk, super cute cat. And no homo, but dude is friggin handsome. Talk about getting lost in someone's stare!
I say this as an adamant dog lover and cat avoider:

That’s a really cute cat
Awe. His/her safe place 🥰
QUADDDEEE GET THE CATNIP QUAAAADEEE
OMG. Many years to you both.
Nice glow-up.

Is that a straight man’s mustache? Or a gay man’s mustache? What’s the difference?
Awww so cute!
Has having the cat helped keep Chelsea relaxed? In your videos I got the impression that she had separation anxiety and needed constant attention.
What a gorgeous snuggle baby!!
This just gives me genuine happiness
That’s a rather large hairy floof you have stuck to you. Looks to have grown pretty quickly, too! 😆
New Alien remake looks good
“That’s a ton of chest hair”
That's a fluffy chest burster. ❤️

Can anybody actually tell me what breed these orangeish cats I always see online?
So cute
Long Long kitty!!
I have a hoodie kitten too! Her nickname is pocket for her propensity to want to be in any fabric cave that will hold her.
Nawwwwww 🤣😍

Love the look on the cat at the end. "What year is it?!"
Is that a female ginger tabby? Those are rare
Cats are such little creatures of routines. My lil bean once was small, now hes one of the longest cats ive ever seen. Regardless, he still insists on jumping up on me and flopping in my arms like a baby.
Word of advice.

Do not get a St Bernard puppy.
&#x200B;

perfect warmer on cold days
cute but god awful zipper sound.
Yep I think you got this just keep it going! ♥️
Haha, I have the same exact hoodie!
This makes me very happy
This is the way
he looks like the eldest brother from Umbrella Academy, forgot his name

Oh my god 😍😍😍
Your cat looks almost exactly like one of my cats. I have two Ragdoll litter mate siblings, and your cat looks like the brother.
Kuato lives.
As if we needed the reveal at the end lol. Cat was half hanging out 🤣

Super adorbs
Still awwwwwwsome
Dear God! It has hatched from the male victim’s abdomen like a space alien!
Wow Andy Samberg looks really good with a beard!
This man here is living the dream
No matter what, he will always be your baby!

I really miss when my girlie was tiny enough to sleep on my shoulder 😪
I thought that was Tom hopper at first.. Luther from umbrella academy
Omg! His tail sticking from under the jacket! I can't handle it!
You just became his litter box.

Is he or she a one person cat? I’ve got one of those myself, and he’s got separation anxiety. Was a stray 13-14 years ago

Love that jacket in the first clip. Also, what a cute cat.
This is so awesome!
Isnt it hot af inside the jacket tho?
Hey, cats just like to be warm.
I couldn’t help hearing this song in the back of my head after watching this post. “And you were my baybaaa
It started when we were younger, you were mine (my boo)”
Everyone is warm!
Awesome! It just makes me all warm inside to see a guy cuddling with a cat.

 Two cuties!
HOUDINI THE CAT 😽

What breed of cat is this??
Cute
Awwwww that's kindness
Just like my Rusty, except on my lap👍🏼♥️

Cats are specialists in "warmth."
Where do I apply as co-snuggler 🐱❤️
Nice beard and moustache though!
😻😻😻
Umm how hot is this . 😍
I absolutely love this!
That’s so cute
I love how you manly men melt around furries.  It's an awesome characteristic, & a testament to who you really are as a person.  

Thanks for sharing your softer side! And your even softer companion!!!
You got married in the meantime
That's fucking nasty
Looks like you both put on some weight to be honest 😂
Where did you get your cat
Chad
He got fat. The cat did ok though.
