Go boop his nose right now
"I'm a good boy"
I do this sometimes too but instead of booping my nose it's patting my back because as a child when i can't fell alseep my mom always do that and i always fell asleep soon, now I don't sleep with my mom anymore so i have to do that myself now
Can we all give him a virtual boop!!!!

*BOOP*
This title is so gut-wrenchingly true 😂 please administer snoot boops at your earliest convenience, if not sooner.
BOOP HIS SNOOT!!! RIGHT NOW!!
Fluffy boy is dreaming of walking around, my dog do the same, she moves her paws imitating walk, sometimes running too, its pretty funny.
Why do I feel sad ?
Do they actually LIKE having their snoots booped. I always imagined that the find it irritating but they put up with it because they love us.

That's adorable. My interpretation is that the snoot-booping is not intentional. He's running in a dream and his paw just happens to be in that position.
My dog boops his snoot for you. He literally presses his snoot to your finger

Funny! He seems like he is seriously napping.
Do dogs really like being booped or do they put up with it because it comes from humans? 

I mean, their noses are really sensitive, I imagine it would be like being booped in the nuts.

And I’ve read that dogs don’t really like hugs, it’s threatening, dominating, restricting, restraining behavior for animals but they put up with it because it comes from humans they love

Omg that's terrible.  Repeated flexion of the paws while sleeping is a sign of carboxyl-fluid retention in a canine's distemper-sac, and causes loss of balance and aggressiveness.  Take that poor dog to the vet immediately.
