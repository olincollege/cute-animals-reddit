I love the part right at the end.

"I got your arm! I'm gonna eat it! I'm gonna eat that arm! *Nom nom nom.*"
I remember watching a series on primates that goes into detail about how the silverbacks that are more affectionate and caring parents have more offspring and healthier troops than ones who simply are ‚Äútough‚Äù. I believe it was on PBS.

Yes, [this is it](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/collections/primates/) ! Very worth the watch.
That‚Äôs hilarious just how much that looks like my husband playing with our three year old.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs so weird watching videos of any primate interacting and caring for their offspring‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just so‚Ä¶ relatable.
Shit. This hits close to home. I‚Äôm a silverback.
I love how they‚Äôre just sitting across from eachother like‚Ä¶ ‚Äúsooooo‚Ä¶ did you watch the game yesterday?‚Äù
I worked at Disney‚Äôs animal kingdom at the pangani walking trail years ago as a college student. One of the silverback gorillas had given birth and they had a little baby, Lily. Lily was very adventurous and one time went down the long hill/ drop that is part of the divider between the guests and animals. She got stuck and was scared. After that her father would always stand between her and the drop, never letting her go near it.
I love gorillas, I went to a zoo where one of the females had just recently given birth, and they had her seperated off so she could spend some time with the baby. We went into the building where you could see them and she was just lying back, holding the baby above her and gazing into their eyes. So familiar, so sweet.
00:11 *this son is what we call the suplex*
What a lucky kid.
That feeling when you realized silverbacks play with their kids more than your dad did.
Why do I find it weird that monkeys and apes don‚Äôt wear clothes after watching this lol
How can someone look at apes and not think they're our distant relatives?
When a gorilla is a better father than my *actual* father.
I‚Äôd love to know what love feels like to an animal
/r/likeus
I‚Äôm almost 42 and have a toddler almost 3. This is us ü•≤
He spent more time playing with his son in this video than my daughter's father has her whole life, she's 13!
And his own affection is teaching the new generation of the same love.
*It‚Äôs not unusual to be loved, gorilla son*
just a reminder that silverbacks can lift and throw up to 815 kg while a human at peak physical condition can only do 400kg
Harambe was stripped of the chance to become a father #neverforget
Gorillas, they‚Äôre just like us!
How can you look at them and NOT believe in evolution?
This so lovely to watch.
TIL I have a worse dad than a silver back gorilla.
Did they just High Five?
Where did we go wrong
Seems like they never lock eyes.
Shabani is also the silverback who stole his baby from its mom and ran away with it cos she wouldn't let him play. His face while he ran away on 2 hind legs is hilarious. The mom fucking lost it lol
They‚Äôre so human-like. It‚Äôs so fascinating.
Donkey Kong December continues
Such beautiful animals
Reminds me of the (maybe) two times my dad showed me any affection and now I'm sad
Beautiful
If this isn‚Äôt my husband and son ‚Ä¶.
I wish my dad was that gorila
This just made me think of harambe. RIP to a legend
MONKE
Did I see him slap his hand for pulling at his pud lol
Queue music: It‚Äôs not unusual to be loved by anyone..
This Christmas my deadbeat father is getting a crate of bananas and a note that he lost in parenting to a gorilla.
See boomers? This gorilla still is a tough and strong father figure while also being caring and playful with his son. It can happen.
Man, that big guy has some good posture!
Throw some jeans, chanclas and t-shirts‚Ä¶ and it‚Äôs just me and my dad at the park
Some humans should learn from this
*Daaaaaad! You're embarrassing meeeeeeeee*
Apes together strong
i wish Shabani was my dad....
Harambe would have stood for the flag.
A gorilla is a better dad than mine

Mine went to get milk and never returned when I was 6 months old
Quit playing with your dinghy!
Wholesome monke
Harambe smiling in heaven
Can you imagine if someone tried to *harm* this Dad's kid? The carnage would be epic. They'd be finding limbs on rooftops for miles around.   


Silverbacks don't f\*ck around.
Maybe some dads should take note....
Are there increased probability that a male Silverback raised by a doting male would be  more affectionate?
Apparently a lot of people have shitty fathers
That bit where he just runs up to his dad, slaps him a bit, and then runs away, is so human kid like.
If you watch this for a while you can see us, it‚Äôs kind of unnerving
Would this gorilla be willing to adopt a 28 year older human with abandonment issues? Asking for a friend
Miss being small and my dad playing with me, that time of your life is the best
I also grab my child and nibble on their arms and legs.
I'm as affectionate as a silverback dad ü•∞
"I'm gonna eat you! Nom nom nom nom nom!"
This silverback muthafucka is giving this tiny gorilla muthafucka more love than my dad ever gave me.
Harambe woulda been a dad like this
Boomer gorillas: You don't even know how rip the heads of of British explorers. Fucking snowflake.

Millennial gorillas: At least I have the courage to hug my son!
To all the men who think being a strong alpha male means being an uncaring tough-tough and that showing affection is feminine and weak - well nature just told showed you were dead wrong.
Meanwhile half my coworkers are still rambling about how you gotta "beat the shit outta them" if your kid misbehaves. Kudos everyone a fucking gorilla is better than you.
This Silverback is out here being an amazing dad while I'm still waiting for mine to come back from buying milk 28yrs ago.
And for any guy who thinks "a real man" doesn't show affection and play with their kids.. a silverback can practically rip a car in half with their bare hands and have an AVERAGE (meaning normal monke) punching power of 2700 pounds.. that's about 5 times more than a human who has a paltry 500 pounds..
That baby got a better Dad than I do.
Daaaaad stoooooop
I remember seeing a video that shows what makes a gorilla an alpha and it isn‚Äôt being just the biggest and strongest but also being great with the youngsters. A single male gorillas may be powerful but a pack of mama gorillas is a true force to be reckoned with.
I have memories of exactly this
Kindness should not be mistaken for weakness :)

It breaks my heart that these animals are kept in a zoo. It‚Äôs unbelievable what humans do to other species for our entertainment.
nice concrete mixer dad at 00:18...but not recommended from the butt, too easy to get bullrushed to your back!
my dad disapproves shabani's behaviour.
I love the little tippy taps the kid does while sitting just like a human. We sure it‚Äôs not a human in a gorilla suit?
Father of the Year? That's a very tolerant seeming gorilla. Kid's doing dominance displays that even humans recognise as challenges and dad is handling it cool as anything.
Son: Plays with penis

Dad: Quit it!

Relatable
My dad can beat up your dad!
Look at that posture
This is so pure. I dont even have the words to describe how its just making me smile. Life is so precious i wish them the best
I bet he tells good Dad jokes.
How can a fucking silverback manage to be a better parent than my dad -_-
I want to hug a gorilla SO bad!
I feel like this is outside of the norm thanks to captivity
When the monke has a better father than you
This is my 2 year old to a T 

Climbing on me, picking at himself, laying on stuff, sticking his hand in my mouth
Do these primates know (or assume) that they're the father of the children they play with? Or do they behave like this with all of their tribe's children?
#Never Forget Harambe! :'(

^((we done you wrong...)^)
That monkey has a better relationship with its dad than I do with mine
Omg. Give him some toys!
When a gorilla has a better dad than you.
I wish my dad treated me this way ;-;
My man!
this kiddo is getting more love from his father that I ever received from mine
It is hard to not associate their actions as not being human.   
Caught myself calling the dad ‚ÄúThat guy‚Äù and not ‚Äúthat ape‚Äù.
It‚Äôs not unusual to be loved by anyone.

It‚Äôs not unusual to have fun with anyone.
So cute
I do believe this is Shabani and his daughter Amie. She‚Äôs was rejected by her mother.
So funny, the lil guy's body language  is just like some small children I've known.
I love when gorillas do that thing where they just drop everything they do for a sec and look like they just had someone walk in on them
Wish my dad had been a gorilla.
This is one the most wholesome videos I've ever seen
Lol this is gorilla is a better father than some of ya'll..... you know yourselves. Don't be offended.
He has an ASS
Damn. An animal gets better parenting than me
Rhythm's a little off. Try "It's not unusual for big apes to be good dads. It's not unusual to see all the fun they have."
They are sweet and good dads
Harambe is smiling down from heaven.
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone
Better father than my dad.
Nature did everyone a solid by making Gorilla such gentle giants
I want hands instead of feet!
It hits me pretty hard that a gorilla is more affectionate than my father was.
u/falsecompare_
I have a two year old son and you could film us playing in the exact same way. It's super strange to see it reflected back like that from an "animal". We should be nicer to other living things on this planet.
Sad. A gorilla is a better father than mine.
Can I have a silverback gorilla as a dad? Asking for a friend
I love how a lot of species of primates are just like us. They‚Äôre just awesome.
Instantly thought about Tarzan

r/likeus
A better dad than my 2 "dads"
This is the proof that we come from monkey
The stern look he gives as response to the chest pounding
This is basically how my toddler and I interact regularly. Lmao. 

Very cool.
I know human dads who aren‚Äôt nearly as loving as this gentle beast.
0:32 is the look my dad sometimes gives me.
This is exactly the same way I play with my 3 year old son. Wrestling and nibbles, then he breaks away, and I say, "Oh no, he's too strong!" I guess its its instinctive,  I never really  thought about it. It's always spontaneous and lighthearted, and just feel natural, much more so than playing with toys.
That has to be Love, right? I'm not seeing any survival lessons being taught like when lions pretend tl be hurt by their cubs bites to encourage them to fight. Shabani was just watching his kid then held him for a while.
This could have been harambe :(
Their resemblance to humans is really creeping me out for some reason. It feels like I‚Äôm watching unevolved humans
Okay but what happens when he has to fix the car and the kid isn‚Äôt pointing the flashlight in the right spot
You can tell mans loves that kid. Thats what it looks like when me and my 5 year old horse play
why tf am i jealous
Showering his kid with love to make up for a harsh childhood when he grew up?
Awwwww I wish I could be friends with him without having to constantly worry that he could probably rip me in half.
I often think about this: is being in a gorilla exhibit cruel or is it a dream-come-true for a gorilla family to always have food and be safe from threats?
He's more affectionate than my father.
C'mere imma bite your face
Wow a gorilla managed to show his child love and affection but my dad is unable to
Now show the vid of a father gorilla who wipes his butt with his infant son, lol.
Fuck !! Miss my father ü•≤
Why is this animal‚Äôs dad more loving than mine ever was lmao
"Dad I'm beating up the bushes"

"Hell yeah son, high five"
So how was school today? 

OOH OOH AHHHH
they're just like humans. very big humans.
#HARAMBE NEVER DIE
I think it's fucking cool watching that absolute unit going, "C'mere boy! I fucking love you!"
so how do we go about getting adopted by a silverback? do i write a letter, or?
Could you imagine trying to armbar that fucker??
Moms be like- ‚Äúcan you watch him for a sec‚Äù
This is healthy masculinity
Their facials expressions make them look so bored all the time lol.
We can be certain that Harambe was a great dad too, let that sink in.
Animals are way better than humans!
Yeah basically when a child loses its parents the Leader would become a parental figure to that child
Why does he have to be a better dad than mine
Idk all i can think of is that video of the monkeys ganging up and drowning other monkeys
This monkey is a better dad example than my own father
Beautiful to behold.
Animals are so amazing!!!
Get you a man that can do both
At least Tom Brady has a reference to nature now when people give him a hard time about his expression of affection with his kids
This is so beautiful and really shows that they‚Äôre loving caring creatures.
It always cracks me up that gorillas have those furry little butt cheeks.
Diddy Kong and Donkey Kong have such a cute relationship
Love it animals are so amazing! So cool to see a pop gorilla be so gentle with his little rambunctious one!
Love doesn‚Äôt die even at this level it‚Äôs been shown by gorillas, it‚Äôs really beautiful and amazing .smiles.
I wish shabani was my dad.
Bum bum
Such a beautiful relationship. Made me cry.
I admire that posture
Cutest thing I have seen in so long! They seem more intelligent and human acting than many humans today! Is it possible our own evolution of intelligence is REGRESSING? Lol, I believe it is possibleemote:free\_emotes\_pack:joy
and people wonder why light wrestling is the only way I know how to be affectionate?
That lil' baby chest-pounding was adorable.
I wanna be this guy's daughter, he's a good dad I could use a replacement
This gorilla has better father than I
The dad does all his playing sitting down. I must also be at 11
this gorilla‚Äôs more affectionate than I am
They really are so human like
this is how i play wrestle with my dog lol gran his giant ass ar and pretend to eat it.
This just makes it even more depressing that they are locked up in a zoo
RIP Harambe. You will never be forgotten

![gif](giphy|l0MYs6k2dAwmpqoQ8)
It's not unusual for Silverbacks to be enclosed in cages. He has no threats to fight or territory to protect. He's safe so he's just keeping himself busy playing with his son.
We should all go back to being apes, things were better back in those days
*Return to monke*
Monke
Monke
They must be so bored
I feel bad for them to be locked up with nothing real to do.
Being a Dad is universal
RIP Harambe
I love monkeys
dream stans are seething right now
That‚Äôs the cutest monkey I‚Äôve seen in a while.
Monke
Too smart to be in captivity
Then you realize it‚Äôs a father son stuck in a small prison and not in the wild..
All the more reason we should stop incarcerating them and destroying their habitat
"damn, you used to be in my balls."
Uh oh, a gorilla with a child? Karens fuming right now.
Did someone already mention that bush meat is still common in some areas? Seeing this make me think it's kind of cannibalism. Or is it thought too far?
Great and when I tell my therapist about my affectionate dad sucking on my hands and legs it's considered "Molesting a child" and I must be "Delusional".
Did I really just watch a juvenile gorilla jerk off?
It‚Äôs also not unusual for them to rip offspring that aren‚Äôt their‚Äôs apart limb by limb.
[removed]
I'm not sure why, this video makes me that much more upset that they're trapped at a zoo.
[removed]
[removed]
I wonder if he saw this behavior in humans.
Looks more like he's talking that up to like a 6.5 tbh
Nice traps bro
So how was your day son
Bro got that dad body with bombin back rolls and e everything
Can't read that title without Tom Jones singing it in my head.
Is this something noted in wild silverbacks too?  I wonder how much of it they learned from their caretakers.
God this is so human at parts it really does strike a chord with where we all came from.
r/monke
wish i had a silverback as a father.
Some men still think that cuddling isn‚Äôt manly.
This is adorable :)
monke has better posture than me
Dad! Be cool the girls are watching!
So that‚Äôs where dad‚Äôs get the instinct to jam baby hands and feet into their mouths.
How come gorillas are so chill compared to every other ape?
More affectionate than my dad
Did you mean ‚Äúit‚Äôs not usual‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs unusual‚Äù?
BEAUTIFUL!!!
Me with my future kids
Unlike their other relatives......
So wholesome!!
Celebrities: they're just like us.
The little guy sitting on the curb tapping his feet really shows how similar gorillas and humans are. He really looks like a little human kid just hanging out with pops.
Better parenting than most humans
Little guy acts the same as my kid after eating candy.
Apes strong together
I've been up since 5 oclock and my toddler has run me ragged already today, but still wouldn't trade it for anything. I think the bonds between dad and child is sometimes glossed over and it's always nice seeing posts like this, regardless of species.
Papa I'm stronger than you! See?

You sure are buddy, wow!
I‚Äôm gonna start calling my husband Shabani. He is a super daddy like this guy. Even has a bit of the silver hair on his back!!
Is that young one pulling things out of his ass?
Wow you really had to attack my daddy issues like that and make me start sobbing at this video
Gorillas are amazing!
Ive seen my husband and son look just like this lol
I heard somewhere that they act like this because they know good fathers are more attractive to the females.
How cute!!
This looks like me and my two year old at bedtime.
Don't silver back females see a male being a good father as attractive or is that another species.
Now THAT's an alpha!
Awwww, I used to ‚Äúeat‚Äù my daughter‚Äôs feet when she was a baby. Made her giggle hard!
Gorgeous.
He's a better dad than my father ever was at least.

Not a steep climb tho.
This is wholesome af.
I got ur arm! Om nom nom. Lol thos is so cute!
The belly drummin foot stompin was totally me as a child.
Looks like a better father than most men today.
Damn, do you ever feel like they'd get so bored? üòÇ
It's a shame Gorillas are so wild. They look like they give good hugs.
Great.. gorilla got me missing my own dad..
My father wishes I never was born \^\_\^
I wish that gorilla was my father.
we are just apes with pans, aren't we?
I wish my dad was a silverback
I want to reincarnate as a silver back when i die.
They make terrible step fathers
/r/likeus
That fucking hamstring flexibility...
Did any other dads here wonder just now if gorilla kids are ticklish?
omg, when the little guy beats his chest, too cute ü•≤
Damn that posture tho
Wow‚Ä¶. When a silverback is a better parent than your own‚Ä¶
I love it,Thanks
Love that
That silverback has way better posture than I do and that is a little depressing. This video is also adorable.
This is beautiful! Primates are amazing creatures.
Hay
üòÑüòÑüòÑ
‚ÄúGot your hand!‚Äù
I like how he casually grabs the kid, by the belly :)
It would be interesting to know what Shabani's relationship with his own father was, see whether this is learned or innate behaviour. I wouldn't be surprised to learn his father was also quite caring and playful with his offspring.
That little one looks like Bobby hill
Absolutely beautiful.
That's literally how I interact with my children!
Gimme that hand, boy!
Oh man this has me so weepy! Makes me just wanna go squeeze and bite my son right now!
That‚Äôs how I play with my dog.
ow nice
Wonder if the child is male or female or if it even matters to an adult male Silverback?
Gorilla/Monkey parents > Other Animal Parents
Somehow it's fun knowing my failure of a father is lower than a gorilla.
They should be the dominant species on this planet.
Just a dad and his buddy hanging out ‚ù§ü•∫‚ù§
It's crazy how these seem like humans in suit to me. This really shows how close we are and how similar in some ways
I love gorillas so much

How could anyone hunt these? Just look at them
Part of me wonders if apes arent basically people who cant talk or do mathematical reasoning well.
Hahaha unlike the real ones
I read this in a Tom Jones voice.
this is just like my dad, but the exact opposite.
I wish my dad was like that
They must really look at us like we‚Äôre a bunch of naked gorilla children
Monkee
Reminds me of harambe who is an ape from the Cincinnati zoo that humanity used to worship.
Miles better than my dad
Damn when a fucking gorilla is a better dad than mine tf
These creatures do not belong in captivity.
Ending: *bites off child‚Äôs fingers*
When a Silverback is a better father than my own.
"What do you have in your hand?"

"Nothinnn"

"Give me your damn hand"
Awkward times when a gorilla loves its child more than my dad loves me
Awwww I would‚Äôve never thought. My hart.
I'd watch a live stream of them all day.
Dat ass doe
I never knew that my dad totem was a silverback lol
I like the part at the end where Dad chompks kids hand in place so he'll hold still long enough for kid to receive grooming.
That kid looks bored as shit. Gotta get him or her an iPhone
Gorillas are so fascinating to watch
Beautiful creatures.
Such a powerful beast.
Mature male gorillas are amazing father's and protectors. They will take orphaned gorillas under their wing as their own. Playing, providing food, a place to sleep and showing them the ropes.
Hey come here you little shit so I can love you
I looove observing these animals so much
Do silverbacks play with their sons and daughters alike?

Not trying to make this a gender issue when it‚Äôs not, just honest interest about monke culture
"Its not unusual..." I was expecting the gorilla to do the Carlton.
It‚Äôs crazy how similar the mannerisms are to humans
Planet is the aisa predicted it right, these muscle heads are evolving

I'ma eat you, nom nom nom!

It must be weird being this intelligent but not being able to ever communicate through language to one another
[deleted]
Just guys bein dudes!
Dang they look so human! Amazing.
Glad to know me play biting my kids is a normal thing.
Why couldn't you have been more like a Silverback dad?
Cmon humans, if a gorilla can do it, you can do it too.
TIL Silverback Gorillas have better dads than some humans do.
The little kicky legs
I started reading this to the theme of Tom Jones‚Äô ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs not unusual‚Äô before I realised it wasn‚Äôt a meme
Someone show this to Joe rogan ASAP
Fantastic animals. So sad they're nearly gone. On a side note I wonder what damage we're looking at if you got punched by one.
Can Shabani be my dad??  ü•∫
He nomnomnomed his hands!! They really are just like us.
Until its competition
Kid looks bored AF like mine 

Don‚Äôt give it a Iphone however
So they give five, hug, hold hands and nom on those fingers. I‚Äôm pretty sure the young one even does the pee pee dance in the middle. They really are like us.
In time of peace, wise Shabani knows to enjoy his time with his child.
Cute video but the comments are a bummer. I hope everyone who had shitty fathers finds something healthy to fill that void (and no, not like filling the void with muffins‚Ä¶ more like positive relationships with good humans.)

OMG, that ‚Äúc‚Äômere kid‚ÄîO NO I‚ÄôM EATING YOUR FINGER‚Äù dad joke predates homo sapiens. So cute!
Kinda an ELI5 question: do gorillas/ other types of monkeys communicate with each other through speech, or just with body language?
Silverback is yoked
They‚Äôre not so kind to babies that aren‚Äôt theirs though
When your hungry but you find out someone's watching
My dad was awesome, I'm still waiting for him to come back from the store, 40 years later. I'm 40.
The primate members can at time look so contemplative. It's really a beautiful sight to see them sitting quietly.
I do this to my kid

Im so glad gorillas aren't more intelligent, they would kick our asses, so glad we have high caliber rifles just in case
I could watch this all day!
That gorilla was a better father than mine ever was.
TFW when monke is better at parenting than my father...
We are so not very different than them.
I wish he was my dad
This video made me realize 2 things. I love moneys and how much we look alike tbh. Some people act like straight up monkeys
That‚Äôs just really cute
Gawd those big guys are intimidating
Man that gorilla is jacked.
Good father! Although he shouldn‚Äôt bite his child‚Äôs hands lol
Gorilla are ace indeed

It is wild how human they look
Awe!
This young gorilla has a better father figure than most of us...
I do this to my girlfriend when we cuddle in bed all the time.  Am I a silverback?
My dad is a total silverback, haha. I‚Äôm so grateful and appreciative that he cares and wants to genuinely spend time and learn with his kids. I recognize I‚Äôm very lucky. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, he definitely has his quirks and his own faults, but overall, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve got a silverback in my life. I wish I could share my dad to those who need a silverback, too.
What a lovely lad.

2 weird thoughts,

&#x200B;

1. I miss my dad
2. has anyone seen the episode of archer where they are in Africa and transporting a baby gorilla and lana says something about is it weird that this is stirring my maternal instincts and the lady with her said yeah and it's also racist!
That is an awesome example , you don't see that  often. They should show this in high school so young men get example of fatherhood üòä
Omg, now I want to go chew on my boys‚Äô hands. I love apes. They are fascinating with how human like they can be. It‚Äôs a bit unsettling.
The size of those hands! üò±
Why is this gorilla dad better than my human dad?
Lol the ending
When I was born, the zoo nearest my hometown had Colossus, the largest captive gorilla in the world. My parents took infant me to the zoo one day.

My mom was holding me up to the glass window and Colossus came bounding right up, put his face as close as he could to the glass and just *stared* at baby me for a super long time until we walked away.

They can even show interest in human babies which I think is pretty neat.
gorillas are really so fascinating
Damn I just watched a monkey give it‚Äôs child more affection than my father has ever given me
In Japan, where Shabani lives, Shabani is known as quite the handsome gorilla. [No, I'm not kidding.](https://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/26/asia/handsome-gorilla-shabani/index.html) You can even buy a [Shabi-shaped pillow](https://www.japantrendshop.com/shabani-gorilla-arm-pillow-p-4970.html) to cuddle up with.
Cute!
The fatherly love.
Lmfao besides the biting, reminds me of me and my dad. So many feet tappies on my part. Oof. Beautiful.
That play-chewing-on-kiddo‚Äôs-hand at the end!  My HEART

Good dads are so, so good.
So cute
This is me with my kids but I have more
of a Dad bod.

Is this the gorilla that would also steal the baby when the mom wasn‚Äôt looking and just hold and run around with them?
Big hairy people
Take my silver for the silver
Great gorillas, love the yogurt too
this is why we should all return to monke
Dad quick to the get underhook. Smart.
PoV you're watching me and my dad when I was 6
More affectionate than my father ever was
I‚Äôm watching this video as my 4 year old son literally jumps on me and makes weird noises and is messing with me hair trying to get my to wrestle him with my arm üòÇ
Makes me wish I was a gorilla, I could hang with my kid all day and not work.
the little monkey can't be quiet but apparently the gorilla likes itü•∞
I want a monke dad :(
So Tarzan lied to me?
Astounding
I know that face, the handsome gorilla that made japanese girls go wild
Jesus Christ they are us.

We don't deserve these wonderful beings.

I wish humans inherited more of those traits
