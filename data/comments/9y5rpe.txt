How do you guys get her not to explore around the pedals? My cat tries to go in every tight space possible
When a cat has a better life than you
# livestream this shit for secondary income yo.

If you are worried about coverage, mifi mini routers are cheap and provide coverage.  

This shit is so adorable, I'd have this playing in the background at work and donate a few bucks.  If nothing else, to watch stupid ass drivers 

Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger.  That such an adorable kitty.  I'll pass the karma on.
Hey, my state is on reddit and it's not for something embarrassing! 
I love you never stop please
My first thought - "aww Mav looks super relaxed!"

he's OUR cat now
How do you resist ~~not~~ scratching that belly!
[https://i.imgflip.com/2mv1wu.jpg](https://i.imgflip.com/2mv1wu.jpg)
He‚Äôs an adventure kitty, in his own laidback way! ‚ô•Ô∏è
I absolutely adore this kitty! When I see these post I get a sensation in my hands. I want to give scratches and pet this cat! 
our journey here continues, friend -

it seems the road will never end 

thru rain n snow n sleet n ice,

this trip with you has been so nice

am sheltered safe from all the weather

as long as we are here together 

across the whole nation, with you by my side -

life is a highway 

that i wanna *ride* . . .
Sun's out, tum's out.
Riding in your rig all day with a kitty by your side, that‚Äôs the way of the road right there, not doing greasy things like picking up ladies of the evening and tossing piss jugs out the window, please tell me you‚Äôll end up in Maine, I heard there‚Äôs a sweet train convention there. 
I wanna die and come back as this cat
This is one of the best things I've ever seen and my morning is significantly better because of it.
Kitty has the Carrot of Joy! It's one of our cat's favorite toys. :3
If this were on in 1 hr. installments weekly, it'd be better than most TV shows.
This Cat has done more traveling than I have.  
I love it. Just freaks me out though if you have to brake hard or god forbid get in accident. Cats are pretty resilient though. Just want nothing bad to ever happen to him, he's a pure angel. 
Looks like you‚Äôre going the wrong way.  Please turn around towards Charleston.  I wish to meet famous trucker cat.  I‚Äôm off at 3.
State is beautiful at least.
I was in a terrible car accident on a highway just like this and these videos are just...  I know it won't happen to you, but it happened to me.  And even as I thought that, at :13 in the video you can see evidence of a terrible accident that looks a lot like mine.  I'm literally only here talking because I'm a human in a human seat belt sitting in the human chair in a structure designed to protect that human.  If that cat was in my car when some asshole lost control of their car from the other direction, it would have hit the windshield at 60 mph.  Because the impact cleanly snapped my right arm.  Sure I understand it probably won't happen, but the 13 screws and the 3.5" titanium plate  in my arm that I have to stretch every day lets me know it does happen.
How does this account only have 36k karma but clearly has post over 100k on r/aww ?
watch out for all the pot holes 
I wish I could get my wife to chill like this 
Does this cat have an instagram?  This is so soothing.
You post a lot of these and I dont even mind. 
Hey, from Greenville EMS!!!
This cat has seen more of this world than I have!

Really though, you should stream this. Millions of people watched a pregnant giraffe and this is way more cute. Also like someone else said, dumb drivers are abundant and equally as fun to watch.
Is there a live stream for this yet
Happiness cat in the world 
[removed]
I don't get why so many dogs are in trucks? Dogs want to run around and play, while cats would be fine laying down a playing, sitting all day in the sun. Cats seem way better for trucking life. 
I want to be your cat. 
Ahhh, the wonderful feeling of basking in the sun in the winter.... I'd never get up either, just roll over from time to time..
Built from PVC pipes and fitted with a pillowcase. We're going to make bunk beds for the cats out of them also.
My cats freak out in car rides. How is this one so chill? 
I hate to be the downer here but holy crap man that kitty would be dead if God forbid you got in an accident. Please be careful. It's very cute but I'm concerned.
Yea it's gonna be a beautiful day today! What part of the state are you heading through? 
living the life! 
I recognize that stretch of road. I travel frequently to see family in NC from GA, taking I-85 through SC.
If I could project hours of your driving images onto a wall when I tried to take a nap I‚Äôd sleep like a baby.  Traveling is so soothing.  My father was a trucker (estranged) and I‚Äôd get to ride in the sleeper when I was younger (3-4 yoa).  Perhaps this is where it comes from.  Thanks for sharing!
Does this cat have an insta?
I hope your cat has her own Instagram page or something similar. She's living the life.

I love this. It's so cathartic to watch cats enjoy themselves. 
I love these Trucker Cat updates, but I also hate how he seems to be having a better life than me. 
I love watching Maverick. Please keep more coming of this little fur ball. You guys are awesome for sharing this stuff. It makes the world a better place. Really.
How to get karma 101
Why do these keep getting upvoted?
I love these posts :) please don‚Äôt stop. 
That is a happy kitty.
my kitty has that same carrot toy!
Your cat is livings it‚Äôs best life, I love the posts and her maxed relax demeanor 
I need a 12 hour version of this 
I know exactly where this is. Maybe 10 minutes from where I live!
That looks like my hood! 17 south just outside of Georgetown? Tell Maverick hello from chucktown! 
I love your posts!
I would kinda be down to be that cat
Welcome to South Carolina! 
That cat lives such a hard life
I really wanna be that cat in that moment.  What a life.
This cat gets around lol I‚Äôm so happy for him
Man I hate I-85
I live near Blacksburg!
And then there's my cat who gets violent diarrhea if we take her more that 15 minutes in the car
Make sure to flip her every so often for an even tan
How much karma is in this damn cat?
Man.  If I saw this üêà in a truck stop, it would be like meeting a celebrity.  He is awesome!
Welcome :)
hey that's my state!
Your cat is the coolest! I love seeing you guys traveling the country. Dude seems super chill! Stay safe and happy.
I cant get bored of these daily posts, its so cute
This series is great
I freaking love these videos.
When I moved to city I had to sell my car. I want to drive on a freeway so bad.
Holy crap. That's my exit!!!!
UGH, you're making me want to go back OTR and get a truck cat of my own.
I just love how he is too tired to play with his carrot.
He looks like Hitler 
The gif took a while to load, so I thought it was just a picture. Came this close to riot.
"InformalProof, you have been sentenced to die. As is custom in this state, you have the choice of execution. What is your preferred method?"

*Rubs face in cats belly*
You know what the cat would love even more? If you bought the Tesla Semi truck. 
That's what we call "aww" üòÄ keep it up Dude. üôÇ
I grew up surrounded by cats. Right now my parents have eight little kitties running around inside and out. Unfortunately, where I live now we can only have one dog and no cats allowed. 
Seeing your posts with your cat have really brightened my day. I can‚Äôt wait for the day where I can bring a cat as beautiful as yours home.
Thank you for sharing! 
That‚Äôs a nice view 
Cats name is Maverick üò∫
I'm curious: is the truck more of a home for him than where you actually live?
Suns out guns out 
That belly
Going through the upstate! I recognize that janky ass looking railway bridge! 
My dad drives for a transportation company and he would take our Yorkie with him all over the US. The pup was in heaven, he loved the trips. This reminds me of him üòç thanks for showing us! 
This cat is the Lil Sebastian of reddit.
Some cats sure do have it made.

Maybe if I'm extra special good in this life, I'll come back as a beloved pet cat in the next. Heaven.
lol at 0:38. Schnoozing makes me tired....
I always hope your post is the first one I see when I open reddit. I‚Äôm allergic to cats, but this is so fun/adorable to see.
Just saw the season's first morning frost in Downtown Salt Lake City today. Thank you for sharing this kind of warmth and fuzzy wuzzies! üò≠
I've been following and enjoying your guys' travels.
I look forward to these posts. Your lovely cat enjoying life on the road with you. It‚Äôs great and awwinspiring. 


This and a cup of coffee were the pur-fect way to start my Sunday morning.

Yes, I'm ashamed of the pun.  I'll see myself out.
Ain't he the cutest, little *karma farmer*. 
Can you give us a tour of the truck? Or Maverick‚Äôs areas?
Now I want to be a truck driver... It is worth it?
Stop in Oceanside for some scratches for the kitty! Ah nvm I just read that as Southern California cuz I‚Äôm a dummy.
Best OC in recent memory 
We bought our cat that same carrot toy, and she freaking loved it. She roughed her first one up, so we bought another. They now rest against the box a friend made for her ashes. 

So comforting to see another kitty enjoying the same toy. :)
This cat needs it‚Äôs own subreddit
Looks like you were in my neck of the woods, upstate, SC.  Maybe going past Gaffney?  Safe travels.
A friendly reminder to all truckers, make sure you're wearing some type of compression sock for your long hauls! DVT ain't no joke 
How do you resist scratching that belly?  
Ohhhh that soft sweet tummy! I just LOVE seeing your posts, they make me so happy! Thank you for going through the effort of recording these for us! And please give that sweet baby a kiss for me! üíï
Drive by and you glance out side window, cat maintaining uncomfortable eye contact whole time.
"look at my balls... LOOK!"
Needs it's own subreddit for me to check in each day 
Have you come through Colorado yet? :)
Upvoted because I can see you are using a safe 4+ second following distance.

üëåüèª
I wish my cat was this chill in a vehicle. She meows like she's dying and eventually starts panting and foaming at the mouth from extreme stress. It's horrible!
Please keep posting. Every post makes me smile.
Super Cat Tv
You're turning me into a cat person
Gentle rocking on soft mat. What a good cat parent you are!!
I love having your kitty pop up on my feed most mornings. G'day from Australia :)
When you're not driving we need a smooch on that kitty.
It never fails that I can open Reddit any random time of the day, and see a cat chillaxin in a semi cruise the interstate lol
WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING..........???ü§îü§î
Car cats are rare. Most kitties hate cars. Years ago, my girlfriend had one. Once I left the car window down overnight. Got to work and found her sleeping in the back seat. We would take her camping. While we slept, she would slaughter small animals around the campground.
snowshoe?
Ah what a life 
I want to be that level of comfortable! Looks so soft and warm :,)
never stop posting these, please.
Longer videos at YouTube 
This looks very similar to my kitty! Is it a snowshoe? 
Hey you drove through my shitty state :)
Canada is calling.
I want to be that cat
üò∫
The cat equivalent of mooning.
I love your travel adventures with your companion!
Start a subreddit!
Airing out the balls.
Reposting through reddit....
I see a new trend coming. Might as well make r/dashboardcats a thing
This is a repost...It made the front page a few days ago under a different title...
Thanks for using the right lane
I really enjoy these videos. Keep up the great awwww work!
What happens when the cat gets the zoomies?
We waved didn‚Äôt you see us? üò∫
Karma farming to the extreme 
The repost of this cat is getting ridiculous.
If these weren't being posted daily and even more than once a day, I wouldn't have a problem with them, but this is just too much. I'm getting pretty tired of seeing pretty much the same video on the front page every day. 
ENOUGH ALREADY. Sick and tried of seeing this shit EVERY FUCKING DAY. 

This is SPAMMING at this point. 
Is this all the cat does? Not a very active life, haha... Hope she gets a lot of movement too!
i hate this cat
Legend
I HAVE BEEN WAITING!
RELEASE THE KRAKEN
Thats my cat too üòÇüòÇ
Skid marks from a car crash that go from the left lane to the median close to the beginning of the video lol
This cat is so damn chill it needs a sunbath :(
Yooo I'm in SC lemme pet this kitty
Every time I have put a cat in my car I was afraid. The damn things freak out and start screaming at clawing shit. 
*at weigh station, in my trooper hat and sunglasses* "Sir, I'll need to see your logboo-KITTY!!!!"
Meowwwsss...are we there yet?
Oh man I drive that stretch all the time! I85 N almost to Gaffney! Neat
Just living her best life is all..
Living the life üå¥
I can‚Äôt tell if these are actually different states, but it feels like reposts that amount to the end of any 2000s rap song where they name off cities.
My state! 
I look forward to seeing your posts!  Safe travels guys!  And give baby a belly rub from me! (If he likes them lol) 
I hate driving through SC with a passion! We used to drive from Florida, up 95 to NC twice a year, and SC is just the worst.
Oh, is that I77 you're on? Also, what a lucky pretty kitty!
üíï‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
Heading to Charleston? 
You can do meet and greets at the larger cities and charge five bucks for photo ops, then donate half the proceeds to the local animal rescue. I'd pay twenty just to meet Maverick.
Such a relaxed position :D
I‚Äôm worried because kitty doesn‚Äôt have a seatbelt
He‚Äôs redefining bravery.
Im sorry if someone has already asked this but I‚Äôve been assuming OP is a truck driver and takes kitty to work. Now I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôre in an RV. Which is it? Now I gotta know 

Edit: she‚Äôs a trucker kitty
Does the cat not get bored?
South Carolina has some beautiful scenery to be taken in. 
The best part about this video is that you maintain a safe following distance. Don't get me wrong the cat is great too. 
I love waking up to this on the my front page.  Maverick is an awesome cat 
Looks like right before exit 102. About to be in NC.  I've driven this stretch way to many times. 85 is a traffic nightmare right now
I-85
I-85! Yay! üòÜ
My South Carolinian cat has the same carrot toy except she pulled out all of the feathers in the first 5 mins üôÉ
I love these. I used to ride with an England driver and loved seeing new states each day.

Hated i80 when it had an inch of ice on it, though. :)
hey, it's blacksburg SC!!
I‚Äôd recognize that Walmart blanket anywhere. 
On 85?
So if you were on 77, you passed right by my house and onto the front page.
What a lifeüôÉ
This was so calming to watch 
Aww!!!
I know that stretch of I-85 very well. Stay safe you guys, may there be lots of open roads and naps in ~~your~~ the cats future.
General Reposti!
Aw, living the good life. Stretchhhhhhh. 
I wish I was this cat
If you're up for it, hit me up via DM next time you guys run through the Carolinas. 

I'm in the Charlotte area and would love to donate some treats/toys to you guys, as a thanks for keeping us along for the ride!
not a carrot all!
What's your favorite run?  Ours was Hershey, PA to Redlands, CA.
Well traveled kitty. Wasn't this guy just up here in Wisconsin the other day?
This is one spoiled cat lmao! If only humans could enjoy life with half of the capacity of this cat we'd all be extremely happy!
I will always upvote this trucker cat 
I love this. 
Happiness cat in the world 
someone teach my cat to be this relaxed during car rides
Meow
Wow, never thought of having a cab cat. Good idea!
If you ever get to Bucks County Pennsylvania stop by! Your kitty is too adorable not to pet! 
I miss home :'(
Cats love belly rubs üòçüòçüòç
Cute cat, it seems to have weird paws, are they long or is it just it being upside down?
I wish I could find a cat calm enough to do this.
Drove through SC this am, in Georgia now heading to Orlando! Safe travels cat friend!
Awq adorable
Isn't this cat in reddit a lot? 
This cat has a really tough life!
I thought I read Southern California and I got excited cuz I wanted to visit this traveling sun bathing cat 
Whose hand is in the video giving Maverick the carrot? 
Sweet carolina 
That is a sweet, derpy, adorable floofball.  No sunscreen needed...
Wish my cat liked car rides. 

Sounds like I‚Äôm killing her when she‚Äôs in the car. 
That‚Äôs a nice pussycam you got there!
So adorable!!! What is the bed made out of? And how have you suspended it in the truck? 
I have never seen anyone be in such a comfortable position as this cat üòç
How long until NC?
Welcome to SC, hope you love it here

Edit: could you also stop by Spartanburg, I want to meet the trucker kitty now
As a South Carolinian, let me be the first to apologize for the fact that I-26 is only two lanes for what would feel like hundreds of miles. Just 20 years ago our most reliable form of transportation was horse and buggy!

Again, we're sorry. 
I'd watch a 24 hour live stream of this. 
Trucking down 85 through my part of town
Looks like I-26
The adventure continues.
I know exactly where this is, being from South Carolina. Very close to Gaffney. Love watching this traveling cat! 
Hello from South Carolina! Love watching your kitty videos ‚ò∫
Thanks for sharing! Love it , happy travels all!
There's something really wholesome and relaxing about these videos. Thanks :)
Road trip! 
I've seen this cat a lot now. Hes going places
why don‚Äôt you just start a subreddit so you don‚Äôt have to post these every single day
OP I have seen plenty of your cat videos and I have questions.

&#x200B;

Where are you going and why is that cat with you?  Are you an old couple driving around the US?  Whats the story here???
I don't like cats, I don't like cats, I don't like cats. 






Jimmeny Chrips ....... I love this cat. 


You are amazing and I look forward to many many gifs in the future. I'm sure you've been told this, make a subreddit!. Keep posting to /r/aww but also /r/TruckCat /r/KeepErMovinCat or something
The carrot's a nice touch. So cute
South Carolina is the most boring state to drive thru on I-95
Carrot is love, carrot is life.
Travelling + cats = instant love


I would so play this in the background with a list of indie folk music.
You're lucky to finally see the sun here. What a nasty week it's been!
Your cat always looks so content.
Not a care in the world 
I love it, but how do you keep the cat secure? I'd hate to think of what would happen if you got in an accident.

Snowshoe cat is beautiful and expensive 
Beautiful cat
How many times am I gonna see some variation of this exact thing 
Where‚Äôs the NC love??
Have you considered starting an Instagram page for her?
God speed Truckin' Kitty
what happened to audio. I need that
Welcome!!!!! üê±üöõ
What an adorable kitty! I gotta ask, is he a Snowshoe? (:
sooooooooo cute ‚ù§
This is so cute, your cat is so adorable. 
I would pay to see this streaming! 
Get a 10 minute film and post to /r/SlowTV 
This cat is going places!
How are you not tempted to pet that thing 24/7????
They give it toys like if it's a dog ducking cat not gonna listen 
How do you NOT pet that belly?!
I‚Äôm def gonna do that with my cat also, it‚Äôs so cute 
What a life! üòÅ
It has literally been raining for the past 2 weeks... lucky to catch the sunshine..
Haha
Is that the I-95?
Why is this so cute
I don't even like cats, but I smile a little every time I come across your posts. Lol keep safe. 
Can we get a 24/7 stream of this? Because I can watch this all day.
Bubbles the trucker !

How long is the journey? I love the updates
*_We livin lavish lavish...._*
Love your all‚Äôs sub !! Use to drive for myself !! I miss it sometime!!

Sunshine on a cats furr is the best, its all warm. 
Come to Charleston!

I would watch a stream of this. No kitten.
I want to stick my face in that belly so bad!
These are my favorite updates 
Rock Hill represent!
This cat is amazing! üòÑ
I‚Äôm imagining the airbag going off and it‚Äôs beautiful. 
I wonder what happens when he sees a fly flying around?

Nice you waited a whole 2 days before reposting this to this subreddit!
Why is this on the front page every day
REPOST REPOST IN THE COMENTTS

[insert picture of quirell here] 
One carefree kitty!
I love these updates 
Nice repost
Wasn‚Äôt this cat just in Wisconsin couple days ago ?
Soooo it took me like two seconds to realize I knew that stretch of I85 North. Then the exit sign confirmed it. I grew up off that exit. Will be there on a few days for Thanksgiving too!! Crazy!
This is sweet 
I've been watching your videos. Here's a small tip, play very soft country/jazzhop music in the background. It'll rock
Hey babe, let's windshield and chill...
These are my favorite.
Perfect state to sunbathe
I love these updates and the cat is so chill all the time. I've never seen a cat travel so well in my life!
That is the life,
Animal Road trips 
Hello kitty have a wonderful trip.
Where did you get that bed? Was it custom made? Do you think it‚Äôs useable in a regular car?
warm that belly!
Oh that's the best! Sunshine on tummy!!
Love these little vids of this little cat loving its little life! 
I wish there was room in my car for a bed to just lay during family road trips
I‚Äôve been really looking forward to opening reddit and hope to see a New Pic for the day !! üòç
/u/vreddit_bot
I keep seeing this way too often. Are these different states being toured or is it thr same video being reported? Also, what vehicle is that? An RV? 
Good ole I-26
Please start uploading these to YouTube or streamable instead. With Reddit hosting it's impossible to share them to social media without sharing the entire Reddit post.
Loving that my state is being posted on reddit and it isn‚Äôt about domestic violence/crazy political guys/crazy religious guys/guns
[deleted]
  i envy that cat's life...
That is too funny 
Hey, I live there!
Safe travels, OP!
As someone who works on big rigs that have animals living in them  please change your recirc filter often. It will save you thousands in climate control repairs. Not to be a downer, just a PSA. I love my dogs!
Have you been through Western North Carolina yet? It's where I'm from, it's absolutely gorgeous.
How did you like the 60 miles of construction from Greenville to Gaffney?
Hello from Charleston!
Good Ole SC, gotta love it
[deleted]
Please don‚Äôt ever stop
No hate but why do all these Posts get so Much upvotes ?
I know that highway well. Hope you guys stoped at bed time stories lol

So a lot of truckers have kitty companions?
I can lay in bed with only highway ahead... 
I love this cat and it‚Äôs adventures. ‚ù§Ô∏è
How to get karma episode 3

Step 1: own cat
Step 2: take picture or video of your cat
Step 3: disable inbox notifications

But here's the kicker: do the same thing every other day to multiple profits
I want a livestream of this 
Congratulations, you created a cult. üëèüèª
Aww you gave him a plushie but he didn't carrot all
This cat cracks ne up 
Must be nice to be a kitty cat across the country like that
Have fun on our shitty roads!

I wish that could be me

&#x200B;
The video played for about 5 seconds and I knew immediately what highway and where this was. 
Dang gummit. Your videos cheer me up. Thank you 
*gasp*

It's the *truck cat again*
This brought me happiness 
I remember reading something about the frequency of a cat‚Äôs purr being very close to that of a Diesel engine at idle.
Ahhh cruising on 85?
You are a great driver. 
I actually look forward to seeing these posts everyday and see where this cute bugger is!
This is the definition of sunny side up 
This is the third time i am seeing this cat and I want to see it more and more . #PLEASE START A  LIVE STREAM#
What exactly is your job? What do you transport and how do people react when they see a cat?
My heart exploded 
What‚Äôs this cat‚Äôs name?
 This what I keep trying to talk my hubby into doing with our 2 dogs. How do u keep this overly confident cat from jumping out and running away when u stop?
So sweet!

Ah too sweet!
Hey, OP, I really enjoy your posts. Please keep'em coming! 
I want to be that cat
Love it. thanks 
Awwwh we used to have a cat who claimed the dash divot as his home anytime we moved. Didn't matter where we were going or how far, that was his spot and everyone else better leave him alone. 
*Waves* Greetings from Columbia!
That's so fucking cute
Thank you so much for posting these! they make me smile so much. :)
I could watch a live stream of this. 
At 0:12 and 0:13 he has a little spaz attack. Very good boi.
I love watching your drives from his point of view 
Is this on I85? Rough ride in some parts for that floof 

Edit: This is right by my house! 
Im curious if the view of his side mirror gets a little fuzzy at times
[deleted]
Does he/she ever get restless and start climbing around the cabin?
I've always wondered what the chances of me being next to this truck.  Hopefully a little higher now that they're in my area.
Random question, but do you have a litter box in the truck??? 
Man, that looks like the life. I wish I was that cat.
I love this stream so very much. 
I love seeing videos of South Carolina. It feels so cool seeing the familiar scenery
RUB THE BELLY!!!!
Suns out, buns out
This cat has a great life! Im jealous!
I want to be this cat, so bad
Damn... what a life.
I want to rub his belly. Please record rubbing his belly so I can self insert myself in your position.
Dude, you need to like stream your cat as you go on routes. People would watch it for sure.
What is the cat resting on?
To the top!
Wish I had this cats life 
If you can get unlimited data I would twitch stream.
I wanna rub that belly
This cat lives the life I wish I had.
Twitch stream please! 
I thought this same kitty was in [Georgia](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/9xmamf/good_morning_georgia/?st=JON9N6MH&sh=1da19e49)  a couple days ago. Road trip? 

I‚Äôm a karma farmer mother fucker!

Seriously. This has to be the most efficient karma farm I‚Äôve ever witnessed. The guy that eats all kinds of stuff and posts videos is good, but this is much lower effort, almost self sustaining. 
I wonder that he's thinking about. 
**airbag**
...
*kerchoooooo*
I just want to know one thing: Is it too late to be reincarnated as this cat? 
I should of become a truck driver
feels nice on my fur!
The life of a cat on tour 
I love your videos! Seeing Maverick always makes my day better. 
My cat just has an anxiety attack and starts panting in the car. lol
I've seen dozens of these posts, but never commented.

But damn that is a cute cat.

I know you are a driver, but if you eber come to Minnesota please share a snow environment post.


This cat has been to more states than me,
guaranteed.
Do you have a passenger that handed the kitty the toy? 
same cat that ate cheese in wisconsin last week????
I keep thinking it's pallet is some kind of suspended kitty hammock! 
I used to drive this portion of I-85 all the time when I went to Clemson. I miss the foothills
Hydraulic Press Pt II 
Is this on I-26?
Do you go through Greenville SC?? I would love to meet your cat!!!
Your kitty is my life goals tbh ‚ù§
then it gets down under the drivers feet between the peddles 

&#x200B;

never had a cat that laid flat on its back.. thats just so super lazy 
Love love love getting to share in your adventures. 
 Do you have a YouTube account I can subscribe to? Dude monetize this! 
Id roll down the window to make sure she gets fresh air. 
It's cute but dangerous. You have a seat belt. What protection does your cat have? :/


That is one of the most annoying stretches of I-85 in South Carolina. 
This was "Welcome to Georgia" like three days ago, what the fuck is going on

tummy in the air like he didnt care... until u reach down and pet the tummy. then he cared a lot. 
Hey, what part of SC was that ?
Hwy 77? 
üò∫
Do you have to use your horn much? If so how does the cat react?
I know it well, I live in Greenville, about 45 min south of that. Traffic must have sucked if you went through Charlotte. 

I have to say, I‚Äôm not much of a cat person, love the pooches, but I find your videos endlessly fascinating. It must be awesome to have a little copilot for the long trips. 
I hope to see yall up here in NC
Do you have a Twitch channel good sir? I can watch this for my depression therapy.

I aspire to be this cat lol 
Showing SC her ladybits 
Maverick is just the cutest!!
Have cats been car sickness?
I love seeing your cat 
Don't leave that car ahead!
Go to YouTube and see what happens when we‚Äôre not driving.
... what if you have to do an emergency break?
Don't ever respond quickly to traffic you could hurt the cat! 
Is there a subreddit for cats riding in semi trucks yet? 
This kitty is super cute! Thanks for sharing!
I gotta ask, what do you guys usually haul?
Wherever u can get some sleep, Right=)
I'm in South Carolina! Roadtripping to Gatlinburg. I'll be keeping my eye out for that kitty, we had to leave ours at home and I'm in dire need for some tummy fluff. 

Stay safe!
Hey everybody! Maverick is in my state! We‚Äôre famous!
The bellyyyüòÑüòÑüòÑüòÑ

This cat is living the life i want.

I‚Äôm not likely to see something cuter on this day.
Say hi to my parents 
This damn gatto is hilarious!

My blood pressure just dropped 20 points whilst watching this. 

Thanks, Doc!
This is one of the favorite things I see on my dash thank you for sharing you and your cat‚Äôs wonderful adventures 
I'm invested in this road trip now.
Can we please get this cat a subreddit of its own? I'd love to be able to see updates on his travels!
Cat tranquilizer is basically just sunlight. Or is that backwards ü§îü§´
Your Instagram makes my day everytime I see it üíõ
Oh hey,  I‚Äôve been waiting to See my state on here.  Safe travels from SC!
Looks like I26
The daily trucker-cat post, all is good in the world.
What‚Äôs his/her name? He certainly gets around! Does he ever get the crazies and chase after invisible elephants?

Too many people in here that put their cat's comfort atop the safety of every other person on the road. It's illeagal in most places for a reason, and regardless of how many times you've done it and it's been fine, you are incredibly selfish to put other's lives at risk over your anecdotal experiences.
Don‚Äôt get too tanned in South Carolina, kitty.  Police will pull you over.
Please don't do this, thats really dangerous for the cat. If you ever have to slam on the brakes or if you get in a crash it could severely hurt or kill the poor thing.
These vidoes! I love them! Such a great way to have some company on long drives! What's your kitties name? (Sorry if I missed it in previous posts!)

&#x200B;
Then the car crashes and the cat dies a horrible, painful death.
Can you make a website so this cat isn‚Äôt on the top page of Reddit everyday? That way people who want to see the same thing can just go there? Because some of us go to Reddit for..you know..new content?
Still irresponsible. OP is a shitty owner risking his cat's life for karma.
I don't know who you are or what this cats name is but please for the love of God don't stop posting videos. This is beautiful. Thank you for making my day so often.

Edit: I'm assuming people didn't read the whole comment. Either that or totally misunderstood it. Oh well.
Welcome to the Palmetto State guys!
Reeeeppppossst
Just wanted to point out that Maverick is getting a little belly going on. I'm guessing it's tough for him to be as active when on the road, so consider reducing his food portions by a quarter cup. He'll be happier as a trim kitty. 

What a great life he lucked into! 
I wonder how far it would travel in the event of a crash. Lovely little kitty through  the window screen squished all over the road while you two lovely caring people have seatbelts and air bags to keep you alive. 
Can I just say, I love your posts and if you keep posting stuff like this forever I'll never tire of seeing it?

I know a guy who fell off the bridge in this gif. He was drunk as hell riding a dirt bike across it. We begged him to let us take him home that day but he refused. He's in pretty bad shape but he lived. I just thought it was ironic because the guy's nickname is "dog" and that bridge made it to the front page in a cat video.
This is going to become the highest rated series of all time.

MASH, Cheers, Seinfeld, Friends....Shotgun Kitty will surpass them all.
