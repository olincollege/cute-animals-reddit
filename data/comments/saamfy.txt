Your cat looks confused, yet pleased.
That cat is having so many feelings right now, it's hilarious.
In my experience, you can’t challenge knitting hobbyists to make something and not have them actually make it.
That’s a good color!!!
Such a beautiful cat , lovely colour and expression.
Get a video of your kitty on the "Cat Walk" with it!

Your mom is a hero. Your cat looks all comfy and stylish.
This is delightful. As a suggestion: the internet could use more pictures of your cat in a sweater, please. Thank you.
Your cat's incredulity at your mother's offer seems genuine too
Great colour combo
I stayed with my girlfriend at her grandparents while on summer break. Noticed grandma knitting and told her knit hats are the most comfortable just to make conversation. 

Next morning she walks into the living room and measures my head and then leaves.

A month later as we’re packing up she hands me my new hat. It’s been 8 years and I broke up with her granddaughter 6 years ago, but I still cherish that hat because it was made with love.
Cat is rocking that sweater!! Love the arm holes!
I'm more impressed that you got a sweater on a cat.  How do people get these things on cats without having to go to the ER after?
My Theo wasn’t pleased with the sweater I knitted for him https://imgur.com/a/0VWqzN3
The expression on kitty’s face….  Lol
She looks just like our oldest, Phoebe. And my wife's a knitter. Guess I'd better forward this.
post this on r/kitting
Cat just wants to know why you and memaw hate him!!???
Handsome kitty!
Beautiful kitty!  The gold really accentuates those pretty eyes!
Great color choice!
Your cat has more style than I do
Your Mom and the cat are keepers!
Mustard is definitely your cats color as well. Your mom nailed it.
r/nebelung would appreciate your cat!

And I'm impressed you managed to get the cat *in* the jumper!
Awww. Adorable cat & your mom did a good job.
Looks like a brioche stitch. That technique once gave me a repetitive strain injury. I can tell your mom was determined to make this cat sweater excellent.
Will she sell these? I got 4 cats in need of cute sweaters!!
r/nebelung
The cutest!
She has to sell these lol they're too cute!
Please tell your mom I want one for myself!
It looks puuuuuuuurrrrrfect
That's the best thing I've seen this year!!!❤️
Dude, your mom is a pro! She should sell these on Etsy!
Your mother is so talented! It looks professionally made and... my goodness that is an adorable cat!
Your cat must have supercat willpower to not be nipping and scratching that thing to shreds.
“What have you done”
Such a proud lion
What a great color on the kitty!
Hell yeah, she did! Mom's gonna mom and now kitty looks very dapper.
Oh my word! That is my cat's twin right there! The snoot I fell in love with and had to rescue!
That color looks great on them!!
That sweater is lovely! I'd buy one
Look at me!  I have a brand new sweater.  Do you think it looks good on me?
Did she use a pattern? I have a cranky old cat who might wear one and my last attempt at a dog one went terribly
I would just like to know the effort it took to put it on, my cat hates anything like this haha
r/nebelung
Your cat is posing like a model showing off the new sweater
That is a gorgeous cat and an adorable sweater
absolute ledge
Weird, but… so cosy?! -your cat
It’s a beautiful sweater!
There’s a reason why we say Moms are the best! 

Lovely sweater and lovely cat.
Your cat looks confused.But he is so cuteeeeee.
WORKS !!! but what's the cat think of it ?
I love the color
You cat looks like it’s asking why you always include them in your shenanigans?
That cat looks straight out of the 80's! That's fantastic.
Cat looks pretty comfortable and somehow that color really works for her!
Kitty looks perplexed by his new dapperness.
I love it! It’s def your cats color too!!!
Now I want a sweater for my cat
Kitty does not look completely convinced of the merits of the situation...
What a distinguished gentleman. 🧐
The cat looks equally confused
It really suits him/her
I get my treat now, right?  Seriously, nice looking sweater and kitty.
now i wanna make one for my cat
Your cat looks achingly cute in this sweater. Also, kudos to your mom for making such a brilliant example!
That mustard yellow and grey is so hot right now
Actually made me AWW out loud.  What a gorgeous kitty and sweater.
r/dustkitties
I don’t really like cats all that much ,  but I’ve gotta admit this cat is super cute !
Don't tempt the crafty mom lol if I even mentioned that my dogs needed a new sweater, one would show up in the mail a month later, hand made.
Everytime I see a gray cat, I think of mine ! I literally looked at him ! I love gray cats, they're so cute ! :3 Yours is so handsome or beautiful with his or her sweater !
You cat looks as surprised about it as you are lol.  Very cute.
I  would love a sweater like that for my cat. You mom is great. Beautiful cat.
Adorable. That look on his/her face is worth a thousand sweaters.
That looks so much like my cat - only difference is she has white paws, belly and chin.

You know you weren't joking.

So cute :D
This looks just like my girl Gypsy Queen, minus the snazzy sweater. I love it.
 omg. so wholesome
Freakin cute cat
Pretty kitty
That cat doesn't see the humor there
Your mom is awesome!
Tell your mom I need this pattern!
In my experience, you can’t challenge knitting hobbyists to make something and not have them actually make i
Cute cat and fetching sweater. He kinda has a "WTF have you done to me?" look on his face.
Your cat be stylin in that sweater
She's sitting there thinking about hating it so much,but she's having a tough time cuz she looks FEIRCE
I love the pretty cat's facial confused expression. I really like the sweater.
Your cat is hella handsome
Puuurfect color
This is 10000% something my mom would do too ❤️ so adorable
I want one to! And the cat plz
Best mom!
And your cat is ROCKING that sweater!
That is one dapper gentleman of a feline. How gorgeous.  Your mam is  a lovely and talented lady also!
You can just tell that that sweater makes your cat feel very special.  Nice job, Mom!!![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Can you ask your mom which pattern she used? I’m going to ask my mom to make one too!
Why is this cat better looking than me.
That is so cute. I’m glad she did. I needed this today. So cute indeed
The cat looks as surprised as you were.
Adorable, your mom is funny and talented
What a great photo. I love the expression.
Absolutely fucking precious. This picture cured my depressive disorder. I love your cat and your mom.
It's lovely.  I've always liked that off-the-shoulder look.
WOW that is one ugly ass sweater. Why did she pick mustard of all colors?
It goes well with his eyes
My cat sits under the couch waiting for me to walk past so he can assassinate my ankles.
We can already see it on your cat’s face
There’s no jokes when it comes to knitting, only ever increasingly difficult challenges to make your known patterns fit other thing.
“Hmm a cat, that’ll be a 6-8 month year old jumper size just with row changes for the arms holes……..”
Love the color!
So cute! The sweater and the cat
LOOK at me - in Mustard Fantasy.
Sweet Nebelung. I used to have one of these! They’re actually rare, and only became a breed in the 80s ❤️
Such a handsome pretty kitty 😺
Sooo cute! What breed of cat is this? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Oh my goodness she should make these for everyone’s fur babies! It’s so cute 😭😻
Cat is as happy as can be 🥰
gorgeous nebelung!
Your cat looks so concerned, lol
Good looking cat!

Excellent choice of colour.

"Am I not purr-tly enough for your purr-tle club?"
The cat looks pleasantly surprised.
Cat looks cray cray.
Yay, Mom! You're the best!
Color is a perfect match. What a chic kitty.🪡🧵🧶
Such color coordination too! :D
And thank god she did!
It looks really nice!  She did a good job
And your cat is absolutely rocking it.
Ur mom is awesome sauce
He looks pleasantly chill, not what I was expecting for a cat in a sweater.
* How can't your mother tell if you're joking   
* How can't you tell if your mother took your joke seriously  
* How can I tell if this is bullshit
😄😄😄
This looks like Phyllis
Cute. My cat would rip my face to absolute shreds if I even tried to put something on her. Not exaggerating either, she's a Tortie and she isn't passive. I gently nudged her out of my way once, and she started slapping the shit out me because I dared not let her stand exactly in the spot she wanted to stand on.
That cat looks like it's an animatronic. Very unique looking cat.
I love that yellow.
Idk, cat seems like it's saying "Really bitch? Do you want to die!?!?!?" Also getting Samuel Jackson vibes from it lol
What a beaut. So much character
/R/catsinsweaters
Super stylish!!
No 😂😂😂😂
Good color
This is the cutest most beautiful! What a great mom!Someone knit one for my dog! How do I find such a person?

Cute!
So I told Mom to knit a sweater for my cat.. she actually did it the absolute madwoman hahahahahahaha!
Love this! My 17 yo Maine Coon would scoff at me trying to get her into a sweater - I'm jealous of this.
As it should be
Funnier when the title is narrated by the cat 🐱🐱🐱🐱
Omg. That's precious.
Your cat is looking truly fashionable ❤️
Oh my gosh, your cat is so cute, and your mom did such a good job!
Love the colour choice!

Looking fabulous
“What did I ever do to you?!?!?!”
“Help, my mom is a crazy cat lady and my grandma is a crazy knitting lady!”
Oh that looks so cute! What a lovely color! Your mom should sell them lol!
How much blood did you lose trying to get it on?
the color looks great with their fur!

It’s actually pretty , she could make a business out of that .
we want the video of you getting the cat in it. we know you have it
What a cutie
She was waiting a long time to hear those magic words.
“You mean it’s…mine?!”
The cat's face is saying "Mom! Are you seriously going to allow this to happen??"
Cat with the ORLY look
Lol am I a joke to you, Phyllis?
So how you cook it?
Your mom is a boss!
Makes me think of the cheesy school photos we took in the 80s. Only thing missing is the kitty mirror image in the background.
Aww that's so sweet of your mom 😢
"does this look like the face of mercy to you?"
Your cat looks … a little insane
Your mum has an Etsy page now, right?
"Wait...was I naked the whole time?"
Love it!
Beautiful
Isa handsome cat.
Your cat looks confused
Adorable.
Very stylish! Your cat pulled off this sweater nicely! Kudo to grandma!
She chose a very complimentary hue!
i have wares, if of course, you have more sweaters.
O crap.

Nobody show my GF this. 

My cat does not need a sweater.
It's the purrrfect color.
What a distinguished young cate
That color looks great on the fluffer
Sooo cute 😍😍😍😍
Yellow is her colour
Cat is now permanently in reverse.
That’s a fabulous sweater

Our cats look so much alike...other than that sweater
Can your mom knit one for my cat?
cat with a sweater "the fuck is this?"
Your cat looks fabulous. That’s a great color.
You have my cats twin. I swear.
He looks like he likes that beautiful sweater!
This cat is adorable! I would knit him anything!
I would order those from her.
Love how your cat looks confused by the whole thing. So cute, and it’s a good color for a gray kitty.
Could she knit my cat a sweater?  She's a bambino and I have difficulty finding outfits that fit her short legs while helping to keep her warm in the winter.  

[For the cat tax, this is Athena.](https://imgur.com/aRq5lTK)
Get her a french hat also!
So confused kitty.
His face is priceless🤣❤️

Never challenge a knitter!
I know a man who now has a selection of warmers for his male anatomy because he says he couldn't say "any fucking use" for the skill.
The implication that he was a cold prick was not lost on him and he apologized, but said he'd keeping them 'as a reminder'. 
Uh huh, sure you are Patrick!
"She really did it?! And it's *mine??*"
Mom's are great. Last month when my mom asked me what I wanted for my birthday as a joke I said I wanted a home made card. Birthday came around, she gave me a hand made card with stuff glued to it, a small Lego Spiderman thing, and a colouring book with us crayons. I used to get colouring stuff every year. Best birthday ever
And the babi liked it!
I can't decide which is more precious, that handsome beastie rocking that sweater or your mom for making that sweater 🥰
Mom. The real MVP here
Very handsome in their little sweater
First of all, the yellow goes perfectly with the cat’s fur. Excellent choice. He looks like midcentury-modern art.

Secondly, what a handsome kitty!
Cat does not find the miscommunication as humorous as us.
I think we have the same cat
Dogs are better
Your kitty belongs in r/nebelung !
I want your cat to be my cat.
Ya did GOOD!
They seem to like it
What a handsome kitto!!
What brand of cat is that?
So cute
God nebulung are such cute cats.
That is one pretty ass cat
Thats what Moms do.
Might I suggest an elastic ring around the top to keep it on.
“If you want to destroy my sweater (whoa whoa whoa)

Looks just like my old cat, such a sweetie miss her!
Lol that fac3. "MF are you serious?! You went with Mom's?"

My mom did the same with our chihuahua
Well now that is adorable
Cat definitely has a Floki from Vikings vibe about that look.
"jokingly"
I’m jealous of your mom, your cat, and that sweater!
DONT I LOOK GOOD MAFKA! -Samuel L Jackson’s cat
Oh, but it looks so effing cute and dapper in it! Please take more photos!!!
The cat looks slightly startled at how fashionable it looks! It won’t accept anything less going forward OP!
Your cat.... You asked nanna... What?  Knit... me a sweater?  Do you see this fur!? Do I look cold to you!?
Fabulous, really
Looks adorable!!
Joke? Ok
I had to put my cats in jammies after their spay for 2 weeks... let me tell you they HATED the jammies... took my one cat 2 weeks to forgive me after they didn't have to wear them anymore.
pure drip
Good lady. Cute cat.
have her knit you a sweater, if she's up for it. the sleeves may not exactly be the same length, nor be an exact fit, but you'll cherish it for the rest of your life.
So adorable. I needed this right now.
Can your mom knit a sweater for my cat please?
Looks fabulous!
Cat is like: "Where is the joke? I'm laughing?"
The cat looks great in it though! I say it was more of a challenge to her abilities.
Purrfect color for the cat.
That is so cute! Your mom is fantastic!!
That’s very cute 🥰
a handsome cat
I love how pleased with the sweater your cat is.😊
Would buy one of these!
Wouldn't you need to take some measurements beforehand to make sure it fits?
Your cat can hardly believe it too
Your cat is indeed knit-worthy!
Very nice. Good color for him/her.
Your Mom is awesome!!
Wow this is the best photo on reddit
It’s a Purrrfect fit!

That’s the kind of disregard I have for my mom too. She sits around the whole day proffering her words of emptiness so when I pass by her I just provoke her into doing something stupid like: hey, mom why don’t you build a Lego house for our hamster? 
I totally get you!
The Cat: "Fall asleep tonight. I dare you."
She looks SO PROUD 😭
Your cat is hot af bro
memaw made this for me?!?
They were both gorgeous, condolences
Shocked by how chill your cat looks wearing a sweater. Did you train them as a kitten to handle things like harnesses or clothes? Your mom did an excellent job on the sweater!
Such a sweetie!!
Great color w the fur. mom has good taste
It looks great
It's fabulous .
you silly person! OF COURSE a knitter would leap on that comment.
The next item she should knit could be kitt-ons
Oh that is so sweet. I love your mom.
Don't they look dapper?
Human… what the fuck is this? I wear fair-isle or I wear nothing!
"I look magnificent!"
Could she do one for mine?
Cat: Am I a joke to you? Am I some Barbie doll to you?
Cats like: day 1025. I have aquired the humans technology known as clothes. I am still deep undercover. They dont expect a thing. Awaiting cat mothership for takeover.
My cat absolutely loathed her collar. I don't think she'd put up with a sweater lol.

Your cat is incredibly cute!
Ask her to knit a sweater for me.  Medium
what a pretty cat
"Why is human dressing me like an ol' lady?"
My wife did this for our cat and she lays down and refuses to move when it gets put on. It's probably only been on her 3 times
Thanks I just got me a fun new handle

This cat needs kitten mittens.
Your cat must love your mom. My cats would never let me put any clothes on them!
My mom made their new puppy a sweater when I mentioned he should have a coat since it’s so cold. He’s so small that the ones in the pet stores seemed too big for him.

He/she looks beautiful in that color.  Your mom did a great job!!
 Awww! I want your mom to knit my pets sweaters!!!! How sweet!
She used a color that complements his eyes and made the sleeves fit his shape. Your Mom is awesome!
Ima thinking that kitty got into the catnip… just a hunch.
Surprised cat wears it
Such a pretty cat. So photogenic.
That is a pretty cunning sweater.
What a great color on your cat.
He looks like hes saying "Really mom? Mustard? You couldn't get one in blue?"
So dapper!
It’s very classy and sophisticated and I love it
Photogenic cat!
“Uh Schmidtty, wtf is this shit on my body right now? You know that I know where you sleep, right?”
I literally whispered, "Wow, that's awesome," when I saw the pic. Congrats, OP. Please go hug your mom, if you haven't recently.
Wtf is wrong with your car
What a flattering neckline :D
He looks pleased.
Your cat is so photogenic wtheck
I wanna look just like her.
Your cat is perplexed by the new sweater, he is probably thinking "why you do this human? I already have a thick fur to keep me warm"
Cat can't believe it, either...
The most adorable picture I’ve seen all week!
We got my sister in law a kit to crochet sweaters for your cats, as a silly Christmas present. Lo and behold, we had pictures of her cat in a sweater the next day. It was so cute!
Cats HATE clothes lol.
Ummm, good joke.
Cat in sheep's clothing.
handsome
And now your cat is asking you why, why did you do this to me?
It looks like a friendly New-Yorker Cat.
Could you ask your mom if she used a pattern and if so, which it was?
Asking for a friend 😁
Cat looking at you like “Am i a joke to you, Kevin?”
This is the way

Kitty with a sweater 🥰😘🥺💖💖💖
Your cat looks almost exactly like my cat, but my cat has some orange mixed in her fur.
Such a beautiful sweater!!!!!
New level of comfy detected
Kitty looks so trendy in the new sweater!
Does… does she share her patterns?
Your cat has the best "what the serious fuck?" look.
Oh my goodness
The indignation in his gaze. "Do you see this, human? do you see what you've done?"
That color looks great on him. :)
I wish you a speedy recovery from the wounds suffered getting the sweater on your cat.  Please consider donating blood to give back for the transfusions to replace the blood you lost.
I'm getting a kitten in a few weeks who's mom looks just like this cat! Their fur is so beautiful I'm praying my kitty gets something similar
Weird
he's beautiful 😻
Beautiful!!!!
This may be my Midwestern American ass showing but like this is a pretty normal thing, no? Around here that request would never really be a joke.
Perfect sweater.
She did a wonderful job! He looks so pleased 😊
Big floofy derp.
What a joke!
Beautiful cat! Reminds me of a stray I took in as a teenager.
I hope both sides of her pillows are cold
And now the cat's expression is "you fucking happy now?"
Dashing 💛
Your cat looks so cute and sweet. Thank you for sharing this !
Great!  Thanks for turning me into a furry!

Your cat looks incredibly intelligent in that sweater
Dapper cat 🥰
Gorgeous cat, fine sweater, too!
Suh gorgeous 😛
Love Russian Greys
Kitty must be in a cold area. That would have felt nice a few nights back. No matter what they say, below 0 F , the floor gets cold.
Can you joking ask for a billion dollars for me?
I love this!
"Humans are so.... perplexing."
A pretty cat
Sweet!!
I'm getting Claire Dane vibes from your cat.
Hey, this is the cat from alice in wonderland.
Lovely!!
Absolutely an elegant, gorgeous color for this cat!  Well done Mom❣️

There is no joking during cat business
"Is this a joke to you Carl?"
Why does it look like it needs a top hat?
adorable
Your lookin like an English teacher
This is purrfect!! 😻😭🥰
It looks fantastic! I’m also impressed your cat let you put it on them. My cats usually would refuse!
Beautiful♥️🐾♥️
Occasionally when my mom goes grocery shopping she asks if I need anything and drops it off at my house while I'm at work.

Once I said no, then immediately texted her back "Batman LEGO"

When I got home, there was a small Batman LEGO set on my kitchen table.
I don't like cats but that's a cutie.
She’s very dedicated, and very talented too! I know a good sweater when I see one, and that is a fantastic sweater
First the tie then the turtle neck then the world
Looks like there was a struggle
Cat: "You think this is a fucking game???"
Your mom is awesome. I'm certain your cat is waiting for the perfect moment to snuff you out.
What kind of cat is this, I recently adopted a stray, she’s 8 months old and looks just like your cat.
awh she carries it elegantly  
mine just rips the whole shit apart and throws it out
Confusion, pleasure and beauty are three words i immediately assosiated with this picture.
She loves it.
I had a phone talk with my grandma once. She casually asked what I've been eating, and I jokingly replied that I had chased several rats in a basement, so I have sufficient food supplies. Next day my mom shows up with BAGS of food. Yep. She took it seriously, called my mom, yelled at her for not keeping me out of starvation and forced her to do that, since she lives closer. Never underestimate old school.
I'm imagining you standing next to your mother, exclaiming "You absolute mad lad!" for a full hour.
What a cutie!!!
"This is not my color!" 😂💙
The sweater is really cute and let's not start with how beautiful your cat is! :o
Ur licky she did it😍
This is so cute. My old cat would not stand for it though 😂
Thank your mother for us
Surprised, but not displeased!  An unexpected, but surprisingly welcomed gift.
The colour just brings out the Majesty of your cat. It's a BEAUTIFUL cat. This photo should be framed !
What a distinguished gentleman
Can you be my mom so she can be my grandma? - Asking for a friend lol
Adorable!
Does she/he like it?
I’m so happy she did. Perfect color too. I
So cute
Even your kitty looks confused, and your mum did an Awesome job with that one.
Once upon a time my gramma uses piece of a dress knitted from cat skin to break the pain at her neuro cross knot on backs. Same dresser...
What kind of cat is this please? They look very similar to my cat and I’ve never known what kind he is! 

Ps, they look very dapper in their new sweater! TOO CUTE
knit this gentleman a god damn suit
Ok this is the first cat I ever saw that doesn't look malicious
Damn bro that is a cute cat…i wish i could have a cat as well
The cat has the look of every grandchild being made to wear Nana’s latest creation.
She can wear it her first day at Century 21!
It looks like the photo is in grayscale except for her eyes and the sweater.
there is a strange satisfaction that comes from forcing your pets to wear clothes.
He looks quite handsome in it too!
My lil dude could be hit twin!!! What a cutie!! Can i buy a cat sweater from your mom. Its perfect
He doesn’t seem mad about it? Sort of confused but ok with it 🥰
What a great color for her.
Nice Mom!  Happy cat, happy mom.
Ha’.  My mom would have done that too.  She liked doing baby booties.  👌🏻👌🏻❤️❤️🤣🤣🤣
Great job on the sweater!  My mother's last cat had a sweater that said, "I Love Dogs" on it.   Ma's sense of humor was working overtime when she made that one, lol!
I love it.
