>You know what, I like this one. He can stay
I swear cats are either nice or give [zero fucks](https://heavyeditorial.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/cat_provokes_dog.gif?w=780) at all.
I feel like my kitten is like this to my 14 year old cat. She's so small she has to practically jump or pounce to get on him. It's either going to be to attack or to lick the back of his head. He never knows which the kitten will do so he tolerates and let's her control the situation but you can tell he's still on guard. 
shh bby is ok 
Let it happen.
Yeah. My gf slaps me across the face before she kisses me, too.
That cat just trained that dog. 
Two happy critters playing
It was like a Mexican standoff. 
I have a GSD and a cat.  can confirm.  They are either mortal enemies or best friends.  and the pendulum can swing very fast!
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember hearing somewhere when a cat licks the top of another cat's head (or in this case a dog's) it is showing a sign of dominance, as if to say it's in control or it's the leader. So (if I'm not mistaken) this would be the cat reminding the dog who's in charge.
Tsundere
Cutest damn thing I've ever seen
Dog - I just want to play!

Cat - I don't believe you.  FUCK OFF!

Dog - Look!  See, I can lie down like a good dog!

Cat - You're...kinda cute I guess.  *inch closer*

...

*inch closer, swat!*

Dog - Not the face!!

Cat - Oo  Okay, you're cute.  *Lick lick*

Dog - :D
Kneel hound,  As queen of this realm, I name you Sir Dog, protector of this fair land.  I bestow on you my kiss, so that my loyal subjects will know you are blessed among my subjects.   
Kitty knows how to gently settle the big guy down. 
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
This cat looks like Chris Pratt in *Jurassic World*.
An accurate depiction of love


Maybe, I don't know what love is
I like how after the dog sits, he glances over at the human quickly like "Ok watch, I'm being nice to your creature now..."
It's the cat equivalent to Steve Irwin, "Now watch as I kiss this ferocious beast on the nose, ahh ain't she a beaut" 
The cat was just helping him get that piece of food of his face.
Not terribly dissimilar from how I received approval from my last girlfriend.
That was so cute. I laughed when the cat decided "ya he cool"
Gifs like these make life worth living
I just read a deeply impactful and insightful message from a reddit founder on Trump's recent excutive order and now I’m watching a cat lick a German Sheppard on the nose.

What a world.

I ship it.
Awww that's such a good kitty too and a good puppy; puppy knows to be gentle and kitty sees that he's friendly. :3
My sister had a German Shepherd that we took for 2 years while she was overseas. While we had that dog we also acquired a Silver Tabby. They became best friends. The dog would chase the cat down the stairs and he would chase the dog back up the stairs. Whenever we would have visitors the Shepard would out his whole mouth over the cat's head and scare people that he was going to hurt the cat. The cat in return would attack the dogs tail. It was such an awesome relationship that when she took her dog back our cat got really sad.  Made me realize that cats and dogs can actually get along and be friends.
This is the cutest video I've ever seen. Period.
CAT: "Here sweetie, You've got a lil something on your nose. I'll get it for you" 
DOG: "No, that's ok, I can get it."
CAT: "You cant reach it. You just sit still here and I'll get it for you."
DOG:" Ok, but be careful, your paws hurt."
CAT: "Just trust me.... see, isn't that better?"
I'm gonna beat the sh....oh wait, no, just wait a second....you got a little something on your face right there.  mlem mlem
"Did we just become best friends!?"
...
"Yup."
This is so darn cute.
I think this is a perfect example as to why I love cats. I also probably relate a little too much to them. 
That is not the correct YouTube link.  Do you have the right one?
this...this right here is the epitome of what this sub stands for
I know a lot of relationships like this.
Trust achieved.
This is my new OTP
<3 Alvin and Baron :)
It's this kind of weird shit which is why I love Cats. They so funny. :D
Omg this is amazing and beautiful in so many ways.  I love dogs, but cats freaking rock... they approach things so cautiously and intelligently.  
Ohh aminals. I think even them don't understand what they do. :)
Cant....handle......the....cuteness.......*hyperventilating*
OMG this so cute 
Wish I had a dog.... And a cat. 
You can tell these two grew up together 
My first time awwwwwing out loud at a Reddit post. 
Still a better love story than twilight
You're playing too rough already! Calm down!

Calm. Calllm.

Hey! Calm

Good boy
Maybe America should put aside their differences like these two pets. 
this gif actually describes me and my wife
Isn't the cat asserting domination over the dog by licking him?
My dream is to have a dog + cat at home just to see lovely action like that
why does it end so abruptly? does it kill the cat?
How girls give me mixed signals. 
Having a cat most of my life, this cats tail was in pissed off mode.  I think since the dog yielded master cat alerted dominance with licks.  Meow I'm stern but fair Meow.

Me and my little buddy were both stubborn and he wouldn't forget and wouldn't forgive when we tussled.  He also got mad when I stayed up late instead of going to bed with him.  My little kitty bastard.  Miss his ass.
just like a married couple. kiss and make up.
Cat training its dog
Cat: Hey, listen-

Dog: No! No, you're not-

Cat: Hey, hey now. Sit!

Dog: *hesitant* But, you're not-

Cat: Shhhhh.... sit, you want to be a good boy now, do you?

Dog: *slowly lay down* Well yeah, but-

Cat: Silent. *reached out paw*

Dog: *Jumps a back a little but remains sitting* Oh my gosh... What is happening-

Cat: Shhhhh.. yes, yes, good boy... *slowly creep up to lick the dog's face as he whispered* You are now under my command. You'll accept the blames and shall worship me for I am the ruler of the house.
Think about how brave that cat is actually being.  It's like a human walking up to a lion that's twice their size, then proceeding to smack it around the face a few times just to get close enough to plant a smooch on its nose.
This is amazing. The cat used its aggression (paw swipping) as a signal to the dog about acceptable behavior. Just like a person forcefully telling a dog to sit, the cat did the same. The dog was intelligent enough to understand the cat wanted him to settle down, and the cat acknowledged the correct behavior.

That is one great dog.

We know who rules the house 
I needed this today
My Shepard and tabby do this too. So cute. 
Being someone who's owned many cats in my life I can say I did **NOT** expect the kiss! Lol
Accurate depiction of foreplay 
[Did you think I was going to hit you? No, I was going to kiss you.](https://youtu.be/NmV8MyYezlk?t=18)
I love how the dog looks like it has the biggest grin on his face the whole time while the cat looks apprehensive af.
My German Shepherd used to does this to the Cat we had. The cat was an asshole to her and would hit her all the time. So the dog would put her head in it's mouth. But she was always so gentle.
Domestic violence in the animal world.
That was tense
Ok I normally roll my eyes at cute animal videos, but this is pretty damn cute, not gonna lie.
There's a lot going on in this gif that is very interesting. 

Dog very badly wants to be friends and/or play with the cat. Cat is clearly being defensive, probably feeling a little intimidated. Dog goes down into play bow, and downgrades it to laying down when he sees the cat's not responding to his request for play. Notice the paw moves away from the cat when it to tries to swipe at the dog, dog is being defensive and not aggressive, trying very hard to deescalate. Eventually, the cat licks the dog as a sign of acceptance, notice the ears are still back so the cat isn't too comfortable.

Very cool interaction and excellent example of nonverbal communication.
I have some friends that have relationships with their SO just like this.
"You flinched, kiss for you"
delicious tears of subservience
I have a big German Shepherd and he is so sweet to everyone. I offered to watch a neighbor's cats for a couple days and all he wanted to do was be friends with them. They swatted at his face, hissed at him, and were generally complete assholes, but he just kept on going trying to make friends. Love that dog. 
omg how good is the little paw shove it does towards the dog like a conductor. it makes the dog whince perfectly
Holy shit I totally forgot posts like this exist on Reddit.

Made me smile.
My brother's cat used to do the reverse of this to my dog -- she'd nuzzle up against him, then smack him in the face.
This made my day brighter. Thanks for sharing!
This is like a scene from a romantic movie where the couple hate each other at first and then during an intense fight, one decided to kiss the other like "oh you've been the one all along!" Then they proceed to make out and make babies and stuff.
Caesar Meowllan — the dog whisperer.
It's nice to exist
She clawed him on his nose, then licked him at that spot. 
Those 2 have trust issues :)

I can almost hear the voice: 
be a good kitty! down! stay! be a good kitty!  down! be a good kitty! stay!be a good kitty! stay! stay! be a good kitty! be a good kitty! good boy!
I wish more fights ended like this
How it feels in overwatch skirmish. 
Cat: Come here stupid cat brother, I need to clean you since you don't clean yourself. You smell awful. Now sit... *smack* sit! Good. No hold still. *Lick Lick lick*
This was a good find!
This is a dog training session.
Wait! Stop! ... You've got a loose eyelash.
That's a dog that been cat slapped a couple of times. 

Oh my gosh that is so cute!
Dogmeat is getting famous.
Haha this cat looks like and behaves just like my ex's. Man I miss that little guy! Gio is that you? 
Nice Video ! they are so cute !!
this just made my day
Isn't that just like a cat? They just want to be in charge!
German Shepherds are AWESOME!  😅
Sure
Just like my first date. 
Someone dared the cat
this is funny
A better love story than Twilight.  
Cats are weird animals
Cats continue to mystify me. You'd think they aren't capable of complex social behavior, and yet look at this guy relishing his power over that poor dog.
My wife does the same thing.
Cat training dog .
Omfg so cute!
I like how the doggo flinches
The cat is training the dog. 
Rather, "Sit so I can lick you".
Way too cute for words! Cats and dogs CAN get along, when nobody's watching! Lol
Why does this remind me of my relationship with my husband 🤔
Just a cat claiming dominance over her pet. Gotta keep 'em in line.
The cutest threat.
My cat licks whenever he hits something and where he hit it/us. To me it looks like this cat is saying "I'm sorry I had to hit you. here are some kisses to make it better"

That looks to me like the cat just trained the dog. Reprimanded his bad behaviour, then rewarded him for good behaviour.
Is this Cesar Millan's cat?
We can all see who the dominant one is in this relationship. 
"Heel, heel, no funny business, good doggo, here's lickens." 
I wonder what goes on in their little heads.
Cats really are like women...
Still a better love story than Twilight
girls on periods
I am the One Thousandth comment on this. 
Yay. 
Can't resist urge...Must break 1000....Comment 1001!
That went from cute to raunchy.
I love these two! Baronthegerman on instagram 😍
[deleted]
Literally every woman I've ever dated
Ha! When a pussy trains a bitch.
LOL Animals are fucking weirdos. 
I'm trying to figure out the human equivalent of this.  

>approach other person

>please don't punch me

>good....goood.....now i'm going to lick your face

>uh...k
KNEEL before Zod!
If only my pets were like that.
Fascinating how even though physically it would have the upper ~~hand~~ paw, the dog could get over its instinct and just deescalates.
What isn't shown is the cat then nipping the dog's nose after licking. It's happened to me one too many times.
This is the content I like to see. 
Looks like that hug scene at the end of Step Brothers.
holy SHIT this is cute
I feel like the dog's getting ready to leap at the cat and attack there in the end
/r/CatSlaps  
That is one brave dog. 
Aawwwwww! Super cute!!!
Why does this remind me of my first girlfriend?
That was a roller coaster ride of emotions!
"Look at me, LOOK AT ME. I'm the Alpha now!"
That's not a kiss. That is a taste test.
My cat did this too me once. He was getting ready to pounce, ran up to me, and then just started licking my leg. So cute
training his slave
there's something stuck on your nose! Hold still!
This cat is a better do trainer than I am :/
It's like the formula for a rom-com.
Somehow I feel like a lick in the world of cats isn't a kiss but something more nefarious like 'let me see if you are tasty enough to eat'.
OMG the feel's!
It's so damn cute though!!
He was tasting him.
I love it when dogs do a play bow!! It's a universal sign of "let's have fun!!" for dogs.
this situation was way too tense for me
I love cats.. :D thats just so classy-cat and classic-dog!
They say when cats lack the head it's a form of dominance, I on the other hand think it's a form of mutual respect 
That's the greatest feline dog whisperer I've ever seen. 
Aww

Haha
Sit...siiiiiit....good boy
"I love you, giant weird cat. And because of that, imma lick you. Mrep"
:') <3
So adorable! 
I have a GSD and a cat and this is my house every day. 
Omg, too much cute 
"Boy, don't make me raise my hand again!"
That is cute.
This interaction is the sweetest, I've never seen anything like it
That is one of the most adorable cat/dog things I've seen, live or on the webernet. 
"I want to eat it but they're watching."
"You know I don't like doing this... why do you make me hurt you?"
Is this why my cats hit each other?? They just want to lick each other but they're moving too much??
I swear GIFs play faster the second time you watch them.
Which one is Trico? 
The cat is just cleaning off a place to bite. 
Cats starting to domesticate dogs. It was bound to happen.
Down boy. Look into my eyes. Look. Look. Good boy... lick lick lick
had to wait 15 seconds until that payoff. BEAUTIFUL!
Literally said "aww" to this.
cutest thing i ever seen, cats love win
Totally disregarding the fact that the cat wanted to slap the dog for the majority of the GIF. But a happy ending nevertheless.
Is there a sub dedicated to cats and dogs being friends?
Dogkind and catkind have finally reached a truce and formed an (albeit uneasy) alliance.
/u/BattleofTOTH
You have knelt before Zod, you may receive kisses.
I love how cats just telegraph the fact that they are about to smack the shit out of you. They don't even try to hide it.
Kinda reminds me of the hug from Step Brothers  
https://youtu.be/mNpIPqNj_NU?t=12
So clearly they are playing, and they are used to it. I'm not sure exactly what the rules are, but I think they are a cross of tag and chicken.
Awwwwwwww
this did not turn out like i expected
OMG, so adorable. 
You know what, I like this one. He can stay
:')   <3
That's cute 
I thought for sure he was going to get pointy kisses. 
First r/aww that I definitely awwwed to outloud 
Dawwwwwwwwwwwww!
I was not aware cats also move their tail when they are happy or playing. Just like dogs !!!

:)
Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria!
Interesting. 

The cat is, inadvertently, using the same hand signal that dog trainers and owners often use to get their dog to sit and the dog is responding accordingly.


How can I teach my dog to do this 
Right after the dog lays down, the cat looks like he's just "uhm I don't know about this...." lol
He is a tough guy, we should call him Butter - LOL

NOW*
Please invite me 
Why do cats always look away when they do this type of thing, even with eachother? 

Like their body stays in position but their eyes sometimes go to the ceiling or to the sides. They don't even look at what they're doing half the time.
Most of my Exs
Kith
Smoooooth, that's how I make my mooveee. Meowwww...
Love it
This might be the most cat thing I have ever seen. He's like I'll play with you! no I'll fight you! yes! no! yes! no! yes! yes! no! lick lick.
It's the house with all the runners again!
My dogs eye got scratched from a cat 😰
Was not expecting it from the cat. 
"U wanna fight buddy COME AT ME!!!! SIT!"  "Ok ok cat" "good boy u no what i like this one mom he can stay"
Awe, this is exactly like my cat and my German shepherd, they are obsessed with each other lol! 
/r/nonononoyes
Licking is a sign of showing submission.  It's done to show love, loyalty,  and the respect of the alpha. 
Doggo is that kitties bitch now ;)
Dog used Attract, it was super effective against Hitman Cat. 
I love this! My cats are the same way
As soon as the camera was off, puppy ate kitty.
That cat's a mover.
Looool make up fights are great. 
I read this as Kill instead of kiss and until the last few seconds it seemed right 
Work was dreadful, my car wouldn't start, got my credit card stolen, and my gf won't touch me but this right here made my entire day. 
Our cats sometimes lick our dog's eyes like that. So odd.
The pupper keeps looking at the human like, can I eat it now??
I had a cat once
Pretty sire he's saying "sorry for boxing you"
This is so cute
I don't trust this cat. Planning something evil.
It's like the scene near the end of Step Brothers when they try to hug.
Is the cat training the dog?
I love this
This is the cutest thing I've seen all day
"Mmmmmm....fresh eye grease"
whoa did that cat just use the force to move the dogs leg???11
*plays My Heart Will Go On*
This is pretty sweet 😍
haha so cute :3 
I like how friendly this dog is. If I'm mistaken, this German Shepherd could probably decapitate the cat because its bite force is so strong.
Kitty still got in a few good whacks 
MIXED SIGNALS
Cat wants it to be licking time, but knows dog is a bit of a douche who usually wants it to be play time.
You know you want me. 
Angel!
❤❤❤❤
This is how i'd like to treat mah girl
Love me on MY terms, bitch!  I love you! I'm sorry, but you make me act like this. Aww, is that an ouchie you made me give you?  Let me kiss it. - Ima Katt
So cats can train dogs as well as humans? What's next? Mice
Best pets ever
Recent events elsewhere really put this into perspective.
Does this count as a boop? 
I think we all know five seconds after the video ends, the cat bites the mess out of the dog's nose.
Love this gif, but that imgur title is killing me, grammatically.
I started this out going to say too cute but I don't know which two to use 
Looks like something our cat would do! 
She definitelly knows how to get what she wants :D
Reminds me of a snake charmer 
Awwwww love this!
It's like that scene in Cinderella with that dick cat Lucifer
Double standard here: last time I did something like that they posted it on r/twoxchromosomes and nobody was like ''awww, cute''

I licked it, so it's mine
I think he smelt a flavour at the last minute.
Tsundere
This is what being married to a Latina is like
The payoff was WELL worth the wait on this one.

Aww
Adorable!!! 😍😍😍
Bingo. If you see two cats trying to give each other baths at the same time ... get ready for a brawl.
Super cute :)
Look! My ex-girlfriend re-incarnated as a cat.
augh so cuteeeeee
:'D
My friend used to have a cat that would do exactly this. RIP Mr. Pickle
You can just hear "easy....easy boy...thats it".
Not pictured: the dog offensive followed by hissing and intense cat paw air swipes to fend the dog away
Neat! your post is in the top 10 of the day on all.
future time friendship
I literally awww'ed out loud at work. 
Too cute!
Love this
r/nonononoyes
Wonder if this dog will come train ours on how to treat a cat.
EASY! Easy. eeeasy....*mlem*
This is truly an awwww
Aww, they play footsie, too!
like it too
Do cats scratch when they paw at things like that?
Reminds me of my puppy.  We wrestle for a bit, I pin her, and then she starts licking my face in between the most ferocious growls you'll ever hear.
I love friendly animals. 
It is true that the cat was showing dominance. It is a dance cats do by testing to see how close they can get. Notice he always had his exit plan ready (his back feet). He kept his guard up the entire time by keeping a paw in the air as if ready to swing to keep the dog at bay but also while scooting closer. This dog and cat have done this many times before.

Cats really are pure killing machines. Their instincts are still so prevalent in the miniature versions of a terror you couldn't imagine if one ever wanted to kill you. A house cat can be scary, a bob cat terrifying, a lion or panther... just stick your head out to end it quicker.
That's not sitting, it is lying down.
I'm gonna boop you!! I'm gonna boop you!
haha
haha
Cute
cats and dogs part iii :)
Cat's, you cannae trust em
cat and dog of my home do the thing like that😄
/r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Staying with my parents and their 2 German Shepherds...can definitely confirm this is what my cat does as well, he prefers them to lay down before he showers them in kisses ❤️
Went from 60 to zero real quick. 
I have a dream - that after all the posturing, this is what the world powers actually want to do.
This is a perfect analogy of the real world. Argue and fight, but make up in the end.
is this another example of a cat not knowing how to react after being pent up?
Tsundere cat.
Ohana means family
These two are physically identical to my sister's cat and dog.  Except with them it's the dog always trying to put Julio's entire head in her mouth.  I think she thinks it's a ball.
They are both good boys! 
Thats my aunts dog and my nanas cat lol
soooo cute
My cat looks just like this and I recently adopted a German Shephard. They both act nice from far away but still after 4 months they scare each other off with sudden movements. Neithers behaviour is aggressive, just curious. I know if they could just chill out like this for a sec they'd be the best of friends
C'mon, America! If they can do it so can we!
Awwww
That is the cutest thing
I've been having a rough few days, this gif helped. Thank you.
Cat just wanted a taste of that dog's eye booger is all
Omg
😘😘
What a finale! The ultimate display of domination!
Love this!
if they can do it, so can we. dems v republicans
My cat and dog cuddle, but this is beyond....
Great eyebleach after /r/watchpeoplefuckingdie
There bond is so loving, and caring. Look so cute with each other
When you come home from the bar late and she's still down. 
That is so cute 😘
I like how he eventually submits to the inevitable
Sit so o can lick you!
The cat has this dog whipped!
:3
i want to watch the whole video. stopped too early :-)
I was getting overwhelmed by the world and this is just what I needed <3
Exactly how my Shepherd is with my cat.  Except she never seen calms the fuck down.  The cat would like her more if she did.
Cat has murderous intent and that clown of a dog has no idea.
My heart! 💜
This was beautiful lol 
Tremendous, absolutely tremendous!
Reminds me of this [scene](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mNpIPqNj_NU)
So cute... Most importantly, the dog understands what the cat wants him to do. 
Cat: Tell me.... does it tickle? You will.
AWW SO CUTE😱
DOWN...DOWN...GOOD BOY!
Yo dog, you really gonna allow this pussy to control you like that?
"This post is only at 85,000 upvotes?"

-me, eight seconds ago 
GSD's eyes have a weird balance between "oh no am I in trouble" and "heh heh, you love me don't you?" that they never seem to be able to decide what to stay on. Very little other expressions. Huskies and Labs seems to have a half dozen or more looks, but I seem to miss most of the GSD's.
i can tell that we are gonna be friends  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfD8d3XJok

 Cats and dogs have such opposite personalities that they get along well. You get sick of something that's like you fast
There is no friendship stronger than interspecies friendship.
That is adorable 😻
What is love?
"stay....stay or I'll smack you" *lick*
German Shepards are so clever.
No
The love this threat. 
Now show us the next 5 seconds of the clip :o
They both have very good understanding. Dog was furious at start but cat made him calm and then kissed. Very interesting love story of them. 
Best post I've seen since since 11/12/16
It's love.
WOAH WOAH, a tad graphic. Better tone it down mate.
Looks like his little woman!
I'm about to move my cat to Germany from the States and really hope this is how he reacts to our scampy terrier mix over here.  
/r/nonononoyes
Friend or appetizer?
Like taming a lion, cool cat 
*lick lick*

I can smell your brains.
The very sight of any dog makes me so happy!

I never get tired of seeing this
Love it. Best thing on reddit
Did you have your cat or dog first? Hoping mine will one day get along!
Feel like that is me and my wife.... who is who tho

Wow, this dog looks a lot like mine. ;_;
This makes me happy

Every time I see a german shepherd on the internet I grin like an idiot and say "awwwwe its a bb!" Because my German shepherd is named BB
[deleted]
Ended the gif right before the German bites its head off
Their relationship is complicated
This cat is basically me and the dog is the men I date. 
Is there an animal that cats are not afraid of? Lol 
Abusive relationship...
Cats living in colonies use aggressive grooming as a way to establish dominance. Essentially, that dog just became that cat's bitch.
More proof of Dog Good, Cat Bad.
Honest question...why are cats being assholes to people and other pets such a celebrated thing?  I find it obnoxious personally

Bring on the downvotes
Love can change anything ,even some rules made by God!!!

Just like my sex life.
I can tell that cat really likes that dog, and it's more than just the end part. You can tell the cat is on the defense, but it wouldn't stick around like that if it didn't trust the dog a little bit.
Ayy lmao
this looks like the terminator fighting it's primary programing of deadly destruction.
He's laying down. Not sitting. 
"Shhhhh I'm pack leader now"
Welp, just got Diabetes.
Catdog baby cummin right up.

After months, of carefully examining the human and the dog interactions, the cat has learned how to train the dog.
Everyone who follows r/natureismetal was scared as f*ck
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS! It's so frustrating to see batting then licking in a couple of seconds. Anyone? Anyone?
It's one of those ones that plays backwards, fooled again. 
I hated cats. I still kinda hate cats. Thanks to reddit though I respect cats. 
Sheer dominance. Those are not friendly kisses.

Pretty much every time gf and I have inter course
When are they going to fuck?
Women are like cats.  Men are like dogs.  Give a cat a week's worth of food and it will last a week.  Give a dog a week's worth of food and...well you know what I mean.  Think about it.

Years of lurking just to join to post that.  I need a hobby(s).
That look at the camera/ owners.. 

"Who the fuck this bitch think she is?"

Then submissive. If I eat her I'm not a good boy.

Reminds me of an ex... 
I am SO done with this sub.  All I see are the two same dang animals here.  Can we mix it up every now and then?  Am sick of this.

Edit: I was just taking my dog out and I come back to downvotes?  EXACTLY why this sub is terrible......

Submissive dogs are such pussies sometimes.
God i hate cats
Man reddit really forgot about the terrorist attack in canada in record time. 

Quick it does not fit our narrative. Post cats till everyone forgets.
