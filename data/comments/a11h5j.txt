Was he declared completely cute?
Oh my god, he’s so tiny! 
Poor baby looks so worried.  
"They take my temperature *how*?!"
Omg this dog is as cute as a little button 
So mini! So puppy dog eyes! So perfect!
This is not a dog, this is a tater tot
He is by far the cutest puppy I’ve seen on the sub.

Cutest ever! Hey OP. What bread is this?!
I hope you gave him lots of treats and toys afterwards.
Every day I come on Reddit I feel I'm compelled and pushed a little bit more to get a dog. 
Oh what the fuck is this cute little shit?!

I need to punch someone and hug him.

So many *FEELINGS!*
He's too cute!
I believe this is what they call a perfect pup
Dies of acute cuteness shock.
My heart is now completely melted.

There's just a puddle on the floor.

It stained the carpet.
Vet- Ma’am, Mister, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this, but your puppy is fucking adorable. 

You will forever have to give it nibbles of your pupper friendly food and it gets worse. You will soon realize that cuddle time is every spare moment you have. The worst part of all? Just look at those damn eyes and try to not get him good boy toys every time you’re out, you poor sons of bitches 
The first of many looks of betrayal when you tell him you're going to the park and he realizes that this very much is not the park.
Nibble biscuit!!
That's so cute I want to punch myself in the face.
I'm a six foot, 275 pound Latino/American Indian. I'm tattooed and have hair down to my ass. The noise I just made sounds like it came from an 11 year old girl. Seeing that face I WANT ONE, but the wife says no because I already brought home three cats and a rabbit.
Lucky you to have such a cute puppers. I'm jealous A.F. 😃🤣😂
so smol, so cute
That’s the cutest dog I’ve ever seen
Enjoy that look... that's the last time they'll completely trust you
What breed is this? So adorable 
Oh my god. My heart is melting.
Shit man! Don't put your hand so close to the beasts chops!
My heart!!!!
Boop da nose!
OH MY GOSH!!!!
Her first time not trusting you for a while. 
OMG. I want your puppy. Thanks for the cuteness! 
Gosh im going to explode hes so damn adorable
Terminally adorable!
Those marzipan christmas things look so goddamn lifelike these days.
I would constantly be giving that gorgeous dog treats with those eyes 
I can’t breathe help 
"What is that scalpel for?"
Is that a yellow weiner?
I can't.
AWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
I want in on those snuggles.
He knows
I couldn't be a veterinarian. I would hug the pups and kitts and never want to let go. 
Well that's just about the cutest thing I've seen. 
His eyes are worried.
WAT THA FOCK IS THIS CUTE NONSENSE?!? SO MUCH CUTE!
What is happening this is the cutest dog I’ve ever seen 
How did you manage to put him on the table? I would've been hugging him too hard to put him down.
oh ! cute pie. Lovely puppy.

"I'm very very worried, Karen!"
I can haz?
He’s so smol. What a pup! 
Looks like a goodboye 
Made the vet's day,probably ;)
This pupper pic made me audibly gasp, SO CUTE and so worried and SO SMOL.
😍😍😍
he smol.
I don't know any vets, but why is it that dogs/cats that have never in their lives been to a vet automatically get that deathfear about them when they enter? Is it because they can smell something unpleasant in the air of previous sick/euthanized animals? Is it because it's such an alien environment? I mean one of my old cats couldn't give a monkeys if he was in a shed, up a tree, or sat in the car (OK he might moan a bit). But come the vet he was all, "FFFFUUUUUUUUUCK no hoomin! I'm getting outta here! I trusted yuh. Yu can kiss the space where mah hairy balls used to be!"
💕
😘😘😘😘
Aw he so smol 
i would never make it in a vet office bc i would always wanna pet the doggos
That size, you could train him to use a litter box, save you losing him in the snow come winter lol. 
So precious!
Oh my god so concerned! 
The harness is a little bit tight for him
That is a gummy dog
Lucky you, just took my 6 year old mastiff in and she needed a emergency hysterectomy. Those are not cheap. But can't have her dying. 
r/woof_irl
Those eyes! 
Is that his collar sagging cause he's so smol?!
I’m no fool ... this is clearly a Pixar animation. A perfect puppy.
Pomchi or chi weenie is my guess 
Awww
Too intimidating
My heart 
Aww 
which breed is he?
Good boy right there
OMG, my heart just got crushed because of the cuteness overload!
SQUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
Oh my god anyone’s heart just melted?
Hims nervous
Pomchi or chi weenie is my guess. Both great mixes/breeds 
Omg I’m going to pass out I can’t handle the cuteness 
Omg
Let his lifetime fear begin.
Wtf he is so cute
Keep him safe
"Mommy why would you do this to me?"
So cuteeeee!
He’s Adorabubbles!
Just spoke to the Vet—her entire staff now has cavities. 
What a lil potato. I love him
I’m in love with thy face ...so sweet
He’s nervous.
So cute
*let the fears begin*


Jokes aside, cute
Oh... he's an adorable cutie! He looks worried, though. Is he okay?
He's so little & cute. Give him a cuddle for me please after the vet is done with him. 
Pure sweetness and goodness!
Give him a treat RIGHT NOW!!! 
Look at those little feet!!!
Those eyes are so innocent!!! 😍😍 such a cutie!!!

Cute little thing. 
The face is asking , " from 0-10 , how cute am i???"

This is what "puppy eyes" look like 🐶
Cute!
Oh those eyes have pierced through the rest of my day. Well done little pal! 
Seems like he is scared. Wish I could hug the poor little one. Diagnosis: extremely cute with irresistible aura. 
Be gentle. To cute to pinch with the injections.

 "Will it hurt, dad?
"I'm very very worried, Karen!"
"This isn't the tummy-rub store!"
My heart ..

Might this be some sort of Golden/Dachshund mix? In any case, cute can kill.
Really cute pup. Looks worried.
He has no idea, that they are going to stab him with a BIG needle 
Good boy

He doesn’t know to be scared yet....
First vet visit but still looks a little concerned .

He looks worried.

Looks like my baby (Bean) blue collar and  everything 😣😣
Cute little nipper.

I took my puppy to the doctor, the 3rd full day we had her, she leaned on me for support and was such a good girl. But currently isn't too too hot on the vet :)
Cute! 
Cuteness overload!🤓
Oh my, I’d always be playing with him, he’s soooooo cute.
Those eyes.
Emerged. Never has that phrase been more appropriate. Look at that face!!!!
Super cute
His next visit is going to be “nuts”

Your pupper eyes make me want to apologize to it. I don't know why. Very adorable doggo!
Smol pup
The pokes are doing him a concern.
OMG, I need to boop that snoot and give cuddles!
so smol <3
The Velveteen Pupper. Lord is he cute.
Cherish every moment with him while he is still little. Because he will grow very very fast.

Hold him, hug him, kiss him and take naps with him. In about 3-4 months he won’t be tiny. Sure you will do all those things with him once he is fully grown but you will miss the days fit in your palm. Don’t miss it!
I love him. Such cute. Many adorables. Very pups.
Heckin' cutie.
“I’m afraid your dog has a very serious case of good boy syndrome.”
smol
My pupper wouldn't stop jumping on the vet
Smol pupper is squeee!
That's one mega level cute looking pupper 
Certified good boye ✅
That Brave Vet Doggo should help this poor pupper now!
I don't think it's that cute honestly
I wish I could give this more than one up vote!!!! That and I want your dog!!!!!!!!!
Will this ever reach 69k upvotes?
He's lived a good life you got to put him down



Obviously joking..he a handsome little guy
Sssssssmmmoool. So cute.
he weighs in at 2.4 smol boops
Too bad this pup was probably torn from his mother and siblings and will likely never see them again. The enslavement of animals for any reason is wrong, no matter how well they are cared for.
