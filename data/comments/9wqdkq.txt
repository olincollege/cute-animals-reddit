I go museum?

No, no museum.

OK. But I go museum.

No. no museum.

Pets?

Ok head pets.

And then museum.

No, no. 
Black cat: *-falls over for pets-*
they sell [bags](https://i.imgur.com/dM4EtGp.jpg) with the black cat on them 
Ah yes my namesake :’)
That would be a hilarious job to have. Cat wrangler. 
“Yes. Hi. We’re here to see the sand mandala and zen garden exhibit.”
Haha, they dont want in the museum, they want some pets from that nice security guy. If pretending they want inside gets them the pets, then that's what they will do.
All wars should progress like this war. 
It's a well-established fact that the degree to which a cat wants into a place, is directly proportional to the effort spent keeping them out.  


it's like a personal affront that they can't go where they want.  


I had to replace the doorknob on my bedroom from  a lever to a knob because of this. The family cat simply wouldn't accept the room was off-limits and would open the door at 3am to try and sneak in.
Why does the sidewalk look like it's moving?
The orange cat still [sneaks a peek at the art from the outside.](https://i.imgur.com/vyg63db.jpg)
I have neighbors that just moved in, and their cat is constantly trying to desperately break into my house.  Before I found out where she lived, I actually thought she was a stray with how desperate she was, and took her to a vet to get chipped (and that's how I met my neighbors).

Anyways, at least once a week, I hear mad pounding on my door (I never answer, don't want to encourage her) for like an hour.

Whenever I'm outside, she usually finds me and demands attention.  She's also very determined.  I was cleaning the inside of my garbage can with the hose, which scared the hell out of her... for no more than 5 minutes.  Because she came back.
This is how I got my cat! She was a stray who lived at a shrine in Japan. She kept trying to sneak into the house of a family nearby and shops around the shrine. The family left a note at the base vet asking if anyone wanted to adopt her and now she’s mine! 

I expected mischievous, scratchy cats and angry people. What I got was Japanese kitties and Japanese people being adorably Japanese and excruciatingly polite. Awesome.
I love how the guy cant seem to resist petting them.
These cats figured out the loophole - come to this door and get guaranteed scritches!
"Are you serious?"

'Yeah, there's this place that if you go to it there's always a guy there that *has* to pet you, weirdest thing.'
let them in 
"No touchy da museum."

Edit: they're definitely there for scritches off the guard though ☺️
Heroic security guard thwarts two cat burglars. 
It’s actually the same cat using the same two disguises every time. 
Art thief trains cats to distract guards
If I worked at this museum, I'd probably get fired for trying to play with these cats instead of doing work lol.
> Two cats won't give up on trying to enter a Japanese Art Museum, the war has been going on for 2 years ~~now~~ **meow**.

&#x200B;
What if their art is on display. 
Pick her up and whisker outside.  
I have a theory those cats just really like seeing that guy
This needs to be a reality show. I could watch this all day long. And God bless those people for treating the cats humanely. 
They couldn't care less about getting in; they care about getting petted. They've learned that attempting to enter gets them attention & affection, which is why they do it. You can tell because a determined cat would've run past the guard a million times, given how easy it was to do so. People who've had cats that like to escape the house will tell you that a barely-open door will have a cat dashing through it. 

 It's the same reason that a cat while knock something off the table while staring at you. Especially if you haven't played with them in a while. Some cats care a lot about attention, and even negative attention is sometimes preferable to none. As for these guys, they're getting petted, so they've just learned that attempting to enter gets them rewarded. 
Why wont those meanies let them in?
 the black cats ears droop in defeat at the end, lol
They only want to go in so that they can go out straight away
LET THEM IN!
It's going to be a sad day when either the cats stop showing up or when the nice guard doesn't ever go back to work. 
Clearly the solution is adding a cat cafe to the museum and making them exhibits, so to speak. 
"Excuse me, sir, I paid for the catnip and spinning object exhibit and I demand to be let in!"
You shall not paws!!
Cats just want to see art, man.  Let ‘em in!  ❤️
Cats are more cultured in Japan. 
I think it’s just the door.  Cats must be able to go through doors at all times, you open the door for them to come in, they come in, then you close the door, and we all know what’s next...  the cat wants the door open!!
If I was the security guard, I'd just adopt them!
Fuck it! Make them the museum mascots! 
Now this is an endless war I can get behind
Dang, Japanese security is tight huh?

If they just let them in they will see the cats will immediately want to go back out.   
And then back in..  
And back out...  
And in  
And out  
In  
Out  
I  
O  

I would love to get paid to guard a place against cats.
Let them in, you monsters!


LOL, this is my life every Friday and Sunday night. 


I work at a doggy daycare, and there is a small tribe of stray cats that live at the business next door. Or, they at least get fed there, and by the homeless guys in the park across the road. So they all come over in the evening, once the last vehicle has left. 

They’re led by a small grey tiger female, and I think a former employee must have fed them. They’re used to me walking around the parking lot when I’m there for my overnight shifts, but they never allow me closer than two feet. I can extend my hand out, and they’ll sniff from about six inches away, but even after three years that’s as close as I can get. 

The girl tiger always stands at the door to the lobby and looks in, even though the entire entrance is glass, as if she is annoyed with how long I’ve made her wait. I always tell her that even though the cat condo room is right there, and all the dogs are secure in their rooms, she won’t like it because it’s gonna get really barky if she comes in. 
Gotta love how polite the guard is to the cats.
The employees are so gentle and kind. I'd keep coming back, too.
"One for the Dutch Masters exhibition- oh wow you're picking me up. Ok" 
Love the lady meowing back at the cat at the end. 

Cat: Why do you do this I would just like to view some art 

Lady: Yes I know but unfortunately I do not make the rules, I only enforce them
The content I'm here for.
I think they made tote bags with the cats on them!
"WHY ARE YOU CLOSED? WHY ARE YOU CLOSING YOUR DOORS TO THE PUBLIC?"
"Yamete kudasai, neko-san."

"Meow!"

"Muri desu!"

Cat: :(
Onomichi (the city where this museum is located) is known for having tons of cats everywhere. I had 2-3 of them follow me around while I was walking through a sleepier part of the city and saw numerous other ones hanging out on the street.
Why won't they let them?
They need to work together! One cat goes for the pets and belly rubs, while the other sneaks through.
Did they try putting up a “no cats allowed” sign?
The black kitty playing dead has me laughing so hard omg LET THEM IN AHHH!!
Black cat: falls over, o no please come carry me in for water! 
I like that the black cat didn’t fight back at all when picked up. This is what the long game looks like.
Let them in! Jeez, they just want some culture and to knock some shit over. 
I never knew I wanted to watch a little old Japanese man shoo cats before now.
It may take them a while but cats never fail. They will get in. Ill be waiting for that post. 
Reddit demands you to give these cats a tour of the Onomichi City Museum of Art.
If those cats wanted in they’d get in. 
First cat: “well (snorts), I can see we’re not welcome heeeere.....good day to you sir”
They're 2 of the dead artist reincarnated into cats!
Plot twist, it's a Cardboard Box  Museum with the current exhibit showcasing warm freshly dried laundry.
It’s this guy’s favorite part of his job. 
I don’t know if I could have a bad day at work if there were always cats coming around to get pet.
They should let them in and observe what they are going to do in there. Maybe they activate a hidden, ancient mechanism that reveals something important to humanity.
They should let them in for a day for like Christmas or something
They should let them in for a day for like Christmas or something
Can’t risk any cat burglars in the art museum 
LET!!! THE BOYS!!! IN!!!
"Sir, you have the right to be scritched. Anything you say will add 2 scritches to you." 
This could be quickly solved with a spray bottle of water, but it's pretty clear that the hoomans are having more fun with things the way they are. Good for them. 
They just wanna see their ancestors at the Egyptian display 
Hah.

The black cat’s flop onto its side is exactly what one of our cats does when he sees that we’ve seen him doing something we’d rather he not.
Let em in cmon 
Must be tourist cats, cause I clearly heard meows, not nyans.
Why are we stopping them from expanding their minds too?
Museums are meant to be enjoyed by all
just let them in. They'll be good for the mice. I think there's a museum in Russia that exactly does this. 
This is so much my cat. 

Coco: “ you may now pet me”

me: pets tiger kitty Coco.

Coco: “ok, now mive aside, you have served me.”
Black cat at the end:

“I’M IN! VICTORY!”

“No wait...please let me stay. I won’t cause any trouble.”
The art of war 
Let them in rude
They just want to learn!
They just want to see the art
Just let them in, and before you know it, they want to go back out.
Blackcat: plays dead, bring me in human as an exhibit
That devastated flop the black cat does lol. "Noooooo! But WHY can't I go in?!"
I can haz culture?
What do we do tomorrow, Brain? The same thing we do every day, Pinky. Try and get into the Art Museum. 
What do you do for a living?  First guy: “doctor”, second guy: “lawyer”, guy in video: “professional cat shoo-er”.  Guys one and two: “nice”.
Unless they store all of their art on the kitchen counter it should be safe to let them in. 
Let them in!
I love how nice that guard is to them and doesn’t straight up throws or kicks them but instead gently block without touching then pets them. 
THEY JUST WANT TO LEARN, ABOUT ART AND CULTURE!! LET THEM IN, YOU MONSTERS!
One of them looks suspituously like Garfield.
They just want to look at some art
LET THEM IN
Come on man I just want to see the new exhibit!
Uhhhh we pay taxes let us in
They should just put a harness and leash on them once and let them walk around to see what they're interested in. I think they might like the Egyptian section. :)
the amount of genuine satisfaction i felt when he actually got in that second door has me a bit disappointed in myself
There is something ancient in there summoning them in there. 
This is straight out of a Murakami novel
most polite war ever 
Lol that orange cat. 

"It's alright, my friends waiting for me inside."
LET THEM IN!!! THEY JUST WANT TO LEARN!!!
Just let them in?
Omg just let them in haha. Cats appreciate art too. 
Well obviously they keep coming back for the pets. Who wouldn't want gentle head skritchies?
I love it how he wants to pet the cats but he knows that if he pets them they will coming back so he trys to restrain himself from petting them 
I think they just want to go to the door to get love.  Not sure that touchy the museum is what they want
I love how the staff are like*
“Sorry you are very cute, i will and must pet you.

But my boss is an asshole, and he said no pets are allowed . Plus i am broke”

Night and Day go each their way 

In fair or stormy weather 

Content, they tread the paths they've led 

And seldom come together 

But here in Art, the human heart 

Spins twilight of creation 

And Day and Night demand their right 

To view its revelation.
They just want to appreciate the art
It kills me when the black cat rolls over for pets. I love when animals do little things like this. It gives them such personality.
I assume they’re humans that got turned into cats and need something in the museum to turn back.

Let them in!
Just let them in!!
"Onomichi City Museum of Art."
Onomichi => Nomichi => No michi

"No michi" roughly translates to "No kitten" from spanish, that's why they don't let them in! It all makes sense now!

*Putting my little knowledge to good use*
Let's be real, it started out as curiosity, but at this point they are coming for the petting 😂.
I live how they are all so gentle with the cats.
It’s obviously the same cat in a disguise.
I want that job, can I have that job please? 
You definitely have to let them in if it’s been 2 years. They’re more determined to get in there than I am to live past 25
LET THEM SEE THE ART
Back Cat will win them over with its constant, adorable self-assassination.  

WAKANDA FOREVER
Professional cat herder for 2 years running.
Maybe they are reincarnations of artists who wanted to see how their work has survived through the ages.
Just let them in and let them take a wander about.
I appreciate how delicate they are with them. 
[removed]
LET THEM IN!
Let them in!
Let them in 😣
Why would you want to fight a war of mental attrition and patience with cats? You can only lose against those stubborn little shids...
anyone else notice the floor moving at the beginning?
I'm glad the guard is nice about it and doesn't kick them
Plot twist: they came for the security guard not the art 
Lazy cat burglars.
maybe he should take the kittie snack out of his work pants
A war for love. 
THEY JUST WANNA SEE SOME PAINTINGSSSSSSS! WAHHHHHHHH!
Persistence is key
what's the name of this museum? gonna make a friend go while he's in Japan 😏
LET THEM SEE THE ARRRTTT
Knowing cats, let them inside, they'll want right back out.
The floor is tripping me out 
Plot twist: It's actually reincarnated artists wanting to view and remember their art!
u/vreddit_bot
This is some sort of animated movie playing itself out in real life
they should turn it around and make a spectacle of it and let them in and give them the best day ever. cat beds, cat massages, treats and catnip, give them a tour.. etc

Is that cat wearing a bowtie lol
Khajiit would steal nothing! Khajiit is innocent of this crime!
are these my cats adult twins, also fight me every waking minute on keeping them off the kitchen counters

https://imgur.com/a/k8JSFt0
let the damn cats enjoy some fine art dammit!
Those cats just want to get their learn on. It's hard becoming an aristocat.
Aww, let the cat-kami go in once! They're trying to bring luck to your art shrine.
The cats now know that if they act like they want to get in the museum they will get lots of pets 
What does a cat falling over when approached mean?
Am i the only one who sees the floor moving 
The floor is making me dizzy
let them in!

&#x200B;
Such fine apurrciators of art being banned from this mewseum? They must be furryious!
Just let them in they want to appreciate the art.
They’re just trying to go to work like their Russian buddies at The Hermitage museum in St. Petersburg [cats that work in museum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitage_cats)
Mission failed, we'll gettem next time
LET

THEM

IN
This has to be some Disney movie
You might as well just let the cats in. The security guards will never be able to stop this neverending cycle of adorability. I wouldn't mind seeing a cat if I was there, that's for sure.
I imagine this like a Pinky and the Brain plan - “what are we going to do today, Brain?” “the same thing we do every day, Pinky, try to look at some goddamn art!”
That guy's not doing anything. If those cats wanted to be in that museum they would be. The cats have made a conscious decision to mess with that security guard.
I could not do this mans job. 
Let them in!!!!!!!
They are just trying to get more cultured, petition to let in the kitties!
Imagine these cats finally being let inside after enough public outcry, and one of them just hops up on a pedestal and casually swipes a priceless 17th century Ming vase to the ground.
I had the same cat who was trying to get into closet as soon as I open it. 

I allowed to enter it once, so cat might come and see there's nothing interesting... but no, after that he was trying to get into that closet even harder, scratching the doors with the paws 
As soon as they get in they’ll just want to go back out again
Why is the floor moving???

When the cat falls over - insurance fraud watch out!!!
They should induct them as Gold Membership holders
Even the cats are overly polite in Japan!
TIL it is illegal in Japan for cats to look at art
I'll go see my friend today

He's petting me, I like that, guess I'll just come inside them.

Hooman why you puching me away if you invite me into your home by petting me.
Now Disney can make a movie about animals rights
They even meow in Japanese over there!
Stand guard at door. Watch out for cats. Gently deter cats from entering building. Usually end up chatting with cats and giving belly rubs. Can I have this job? He looks so happy! And the uniforms are snazzy!

Or can this be some kind of web comic or cartoon? Later to be rebooted as live action epic blockbuster movie? Because I would watch this.

Plot twist: Security guard and the cats are mortal enemies … until lunch break, where they all clock out, meet up at the park bench across the street and have a daily picnic … until their break is over, then it’s back to being mortal enemies!
These are the kinds of problems you have in a superior society

that and discriminating against people who seem kinda koreansy
"One day. One day and will be able to get in!".
Let them in???? I dunno.  You never ever ever win against C A T
They're Cultural Cats. Or perhaps they have been reincarnated and would like to see their works in a museum. We all know it takes an artist's death to make their works more appreciated. 
Cats, man. They never want to go into that one place until they find out they're not allowed to go in.
Must.. Get.. job.. there
Guard: puts up hand wall
Cat: "This guy gives weird pets"
Let them in :(
the floor is like moving 

&#x200B;
The floor is moving whats in this coffee
I have a feeling some employee gave them food one time and since then they will forever come ask for the Yums. My house is a local outdoor cat hot spot because I give them a bit of dry food or treats whenever they come visit.


Now one of them will literally scratch my window at 2AM for treats. You bet you I give them to him 
They want to apply for the mice management position, I see no wrong.
The cats are clearly winning
That security guard respectfully denying entry to the cats with his white gloves, and the cats respecting his barrier, is probably the most pure thing I'll see today.
This is a Murakami story in waiting.  
Polite guard, gotta love people like that 
Can somebody just give them a tour already?
Have they not considered the cats may be on a very important mission?
Is the floor moving or am I just stoned?
This is precious. I hope those cats aren't homeless 
Very patient cat burglars casing the museum waiting for one more cat painting acquisition before pouncing.
I love how gentle the security guards and staff are with them. Heart-warming post.
It's like herding cats at this place. 
THEY ARE THE ART. LET THEM IN
That dude is the official cat bouncer for the museum.
Those cats are simply trying to enjoy the finer things in life
Omg that slow ass little dude at the end! He tried to be so smooth! 
First day of security training:

Instructor- Ok kid we've covered everything except the most important aspect of the job.... You see those cats over there?
Just invite them in. Then they won’t come in. 
Look at how clean the ground outside is. 
Persistence like that should be rewarded. Let them in.
LET THEM
This is discrimination, cats can appreciate art too.
that guy could use a dog for that 
I thought they had some kind of cool moving floor but that's just the video being funky about all the lines.
Mission Impawsible
"Hey uuuuhhhh Mr police man. I just want to say hi to the art"
This is so Japanese. Politeness even extended to cats. 
Just let them in. Set up food and water and a box out of the way and people will get to enjoy real fine art in motion and sleeping, of course. 
I have a neighborhood cat who has been trying to get into my house for over 2 years. About 3 days out of the week he shows up when I'm getting home and tries sneaking his way in. 
"You don't understand officer, I am here to curate the historicity of the Egyptian cat goddess collection! You can't possibly bar me from my research!"

"Please go away."
When your job is literally going from dealing with rebellious pussycats at best to potentially armed art thieves at worst, then you know you've got a life full of excitement.
They reject those kitties so gently and kindly. This is the only war I truly support.
A stray cat has been adopted by a museum in Krakow. He now lives there and is one of the attractions [https://www.google.com/search?biw=1650&bih=1306&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=eEbrW4vhCIaSmgWD14fABQ&q=kot+hipolit+krakow&oq=kot+hipolit+krakow&gs\_l=img.3...42730.43177.0.43626.4.4.0.0.0.0.74.237.4.4.0](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1650&bih=1306&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=eEbrW4vhCIaSmgWD14fABQ&q=kot+hipolit+krakow&oq=kot+hipolit+krakow&gs_l=img.3...42730.43177.0.43626.4.4.0.0.0.0.74.237.4.4.0)....0...1c.1.64.img..0.0.0....0.jmXhanl7nEA
The cats do not wish to enter the museum. They just want to sit half in and half out; preventing the doors from closing.
LET THEM IN
I love how the guards like you ain't coming in but I'll give you a pat.
pink panther who?
Damnit Frank just let me see the art
This needs to be a Ghibli film. Any good writers want to write a bit?
Lmao that last attempt, the cat looks back at the person filming like, dude, gtfo, you're gonna burn me out. 
Hey should just let them in because two minutes later they'll just want to go outside.
Cats are amazing, they just give absolutely no fucks
Just let it in! 
I remember in the early 90s, there were "staff" cats at the Hagia Sophia 
My heart. <3
Wonder if the cats will ever win.
Those cats could totally get in if they really wanted. They are just toying with the hoomans
This is exactly what my two cats look like!! Let them in!
Let them in!!!! :(
LET THEM IN YOU MONSTERS!
They just want to see the art!!
My reaction to the video was exclaiming "Kitty!"
just let them in.
I kinda feel like they should let them in and see what happens...
They just wanna look at the arts!!!
Let kittens learn about arts! Bullies. 
Just let them in
I love how the black kitty just rolled over for belly rubs when the security guard confronted him. Good use of distraction! 
I'm sure there are mice these cats can chase/catch in the museum. Let them in!!!
How dare they not let them in to jump up on all the tables and knock down incredibly expensive art pieces
They just want to see all the art man, c'mon let them in.
Let him IN 😡😡😡😡😡
they come for petting. 
I'd let them in to see where they go and what it is that they want.
You let those cats in
LET THEM IN
They just want the cuddles

I needed this. Good people and good kitties.
LET THEM IN!!!!!!!!!
Let them in!
Just let them in

Edit:Wow Thanks for the gold stranger
Just put a leash on the cats and see what they ate so interested in.
Let them in ! 
It's purrformance art!
r/LetTheDamnKittyIn 
It's Gintoki and Katsura -  let them in! They need to un-curse themselves! And... is that Kondo-San? Oh, no, nevermind, that's just a gorilla.
Imagine if you had a customer service job and this was your only rough situation.
Now I really want to visit that museum. If they've been trying to get in for two years, it must be a great museum.
Id let em in
Those are the worst cat burglars I've ever seen
They look healthy so that makes me happy:)
For the love of god, someone take the little cats into the museum! 
They should just put some cucumbers out front. 
Dream job
lol I love how non-threatening the guards are... they're just like "no, please do enter sir, it is not allowed"
I got real sad when the security wasn’t there in the end 
Neko wa yurusarenai. Gomen'nasai...
WHY IS THE FLOOR MOVING 
I want to know why they want to enter this particular building, although stopped for 2 years with persistence. I if they on one occasion let them in, just to see what they do
I like how the cat tries to go in the building
Those silly cats, everyone knows they have to stand one on another and wear a long trench coat
Anyone else think the floor was moving at the beginning of the clip?? 😲😂
Plot twist.   Neither cat really wants in.  They just know if they pretend to try they will get pets.
This is me trying to block my roommates cats from entering my basement suite

Can almost guarantee it was the orange one's idea
This doorman is so sweet with the cats. I guarantee if he’s married his wife is always stuck playing bad cop. 
***LET HIM IN***
That last cat: "nya"
In English: "UNHAND ME YOU FILTHY SCOUNDREL"
Let! Them! Appreciate! Art!!
They want in because they know there's lots of rare and valuable breakables that need to be shoved off of tables.
cant they just let them in
Am I high or is the floor suppose to move.
See if they’ll let you put a leash on them then take them around just once!! Lmaoo!!
I’m guessing the owner lives near by. If they were strays someone would have taken them home after 2 yrs of this shit 
Jesus, just let them in already! 
Why does the floor look like it's moving
I love how nice they are to the cats.
Just let them in. They'll change their mind in two seconds and leave on their own. 
They're going about it all wrong, the guard guy should just face the other way and make it look like he's challenging people coming out, then the cats will demand to be out, which they already are.
This would make a fabulous short story.
They should make a smaller museum out of cardboard boxes and put it near the door. Problem solved.
Let them in they are trying to pay their respects 

&#x200B;
#Praise be to the newest Champion of Reddit, u/HanaWong!

[Let us not forget the Champions of yore...](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChampionsOfReddit/)
Someone should let the guard know he is owned by 2 cats... And has been for 2 years. 
LET THEM IN YOU MONSTERS! They just want to experience culture!!
Let them in! 
what's in there...? humanity won't understand 
Let👏🏼them👏🏼in👏🏼
Take cat 
Well, it's clear to me why this keeps happening - the name of the museum is Onomichi, or O-nom-ichi.  O is "great", ichi is "one", and nom is the sound cats make when eating, as in "om-nom-nom".

So they think it's an all-you-can-eat buffet. ;)

Edit: ... well *I* thought it was funny :(
how do i interview for this position?
Love how gentle he is with them. Very respectful, +100 faith in humanity points. 
Reincarnated artists

They just wanna see "Meowart".
Solution: let them in. It may seem counterintuitive, but any cat owner knows that something being forbidden makes it 100x more interesting. Once granted permission, they’ll lose all interest.
Is kind of sad that this cats being 2 years there and nobody has step up and adopted them ????
I love the method they take with dealing with the cats. Nothing abusive, no squirt bottles, just blocking them and giving them pets. 
Mental note: Japanese cats are much more cultured than Canadian cats.
Let them enter, and watch what they intend to achieve........
I am going to Japan next week- does anybody know what museum this is? I would like to see the cats. And also the art of course.
They just want to educate themselves! Let them in!
Maybe they should just let them in. 😀
This is amazing. I just asked my bf if we can visit this place when we finally end up going to Japan. 
Those cats just want to enjoy some good arts!
more like onomeowchi
Let them in. Make them an art exhibit. Problem solved
They just want to appreciate the arts! Let them in I say! 
"No! I said go into the restaurant, not the museum!" 
Is there a large tuna display in there?

&#x200B;
Would someone please take those cats home.
Let them in and make them curator of art of the museum, that would be awesome.
Let them in. Cats want to admire art as well
I used to have a cat like that; we had to watch out every time we opened the door or she'd run in. 

&#x200B;

We loved her to death, but still.
Aww they prob see it as a home
Is Lucy in there??
LET IT GO INSIDE
Cute! Would make a good start of a children's book

trying this because itll still likely be faster than v.reddit on mobile..

This makes me so happy.

Cutest war ever!
"Officer, you don't realize.  This door was about to *close*.  I'm doing the world a service by making sure it stays open!"
Let them in!
Let them in!!!! 
Job security.
Must be all the pictures of fish.
Just let them in, they're clearly big art fans
You know, if they worked as a team, they could beat him.
"Damn it, Shintaro! We just want to get our culture on!"
LET! THEM! IN!
JUST LET THEM IN. 
That is so adorable 
That guy has the best job in the world. I wonder if he ever brings cat treats?
I would create a distraction so the kitties could slip by.
Leddem look at the art! 
I love that flop the black cat does:)
Touchy the painting? 
Let him in 
What a lovely war
this is so adorably wholesome, imagine having a job as a security guard to keep cute lil kitties out 
Just hire them as support staff!
Been going on for 2 years meow you say, hmm?
Let them in!
Cat burglars....
Let them in you buttheads! 😛
That aliasing made me think the floor was moving
Awww let them in ! 
He’s so kind 💕
Aww lawd he comin!
They’re master is calling them from the grave. He is gathering his troops. The day of awakening has come. 
Cat is an art of nature... They belong there. 
they should probably just go ahead and surrender.   They cant win this war.   Too much adorable floof.
What if these cats has a loved one from a past life where they’re trying to reach in the museum?
The cats are just a distraction for the art burglars.
One day these cats won't come back and the security guard will wish he had let them in just once. 
What’s Michael!!
Lol security needs a spray bottle
oh just let the fucker in

Sidenote: I wish t his was everyones worst problem. This seems like the life.
There's 3rd world problems...1st world problems....and only in Japan problems.
Are these strays? They look well fed and cared for esp tubby orange boi
They only want in because they're not allowed in and they know it. Typical cats! 
One is distracting you as the other steals the art.

Cat burglars.
This man has the luckiest job in world
Careful they're cat burglars.
Plot twist: the cats are actually keeping the security guard from leaving the museum.
I got one too😊
Squirt gun. 
Let them in 
u/gemini_11 your cats trying too get in the room
Or ...

Two cats won’t give up on helping security officer exit a Japanese art museum, the attempt has been going on 2 years now. 

edit: typo
My cat also always wants to go inside rooms that are closed. Like I'll close a door and my cat instantly wants to go in now. 
They left their keys in there!
I’m pretty sure this is a Murakami novella.
Imagine what would they do if they would get inside though 😄
My room mates cat is like this. No matter where I sit on the couch he has to sit in the left most corner. 
Let em in
Awww. The staff are so gentle with them. 
My soul needed this. 
that dude is straight up being stalked by freaking cats
I wish those cats would do that but to my house 
Ooh the humanity, 
Oh, just let them in already. 😆
It's clear to me, they are cultured, sophisticated and in need of wanting to observe new exhibitions at the museum.
At some museums in Italy they had books in the gift shops about dogs and cats in the paintings. The title translated roughly to "We Are Already Inside."
That is how I like my wars.
Oh my gosh this is sooo cute! They are so loved. Look how healthy they look too! 
They made it boys, after two long difficult years they finally did it
I love how in Japanese official kinda jobs they always wear those white gloves. 
Just needs an artist to catch them, give them tags, enter them as living art, then free them again.
They should place boxes outside, need a cat trap
r/PetTheDamnCat 
This would be a great way to distract the guards while you rob the art museum 
*LET THEM IN!!!*
There is no persistence like cat persistence. 
This would stop happening if the guard took them to his real home
*a bunch of humans won't give up a perfect cathouse. What dogs in the manger.
LET THEM ENJOY THE ART
These security guard groupies are getting out of hand
Must be something to do with that cat-nip exhibit 😂
So adorable! The flop! I’m glad they look well fed... although the orange tabby sure is a bit chubby haha!
Surprised this isn't a substory for Kiryu in the yakuza games. 
let them in pleaseeee!!!
Pretty sure a cardboard box off to the side of the door would fix this problem... Or attract more cats.  
Only one way to find out.
Let the cats enjoy art too! 
If I pet it, maybe it will go away
Let them in damn it
I would home those 2 cats soooo fast! I wish they had homes. :(
there a mummy in that museum and those two cats are trying to protect humanity...
Let!! Them!! In!!
Why are they so docile :C
Then let them keep their mice if they don't want these helpers to help.
The floor moves 
Let them see THE ART!!!!!!
Oh boy! I bet that guy loves the “how was work?” question when he gets home.
That cat is clearly a recently cursed, former human being, who must interact with a haunted piece of ancient art in order to regain his human form. That cat/dude must be pissed. 
/u/vreddit_bot 
Just let them in already jeez they can feel the spirits in the artwork 
He try to keep the cat out
Onomichio-da!!
they just love that guy.
Are they trying to enter or visiting the guard?
I love how routine this has become. I can hear them now:

"Ohayo gozaimasu! I'm here to sneak in again!"

"Ohayo, neko-chan! Sorry but not today. Just like yesterday, and every day..."
Everyone saying they are just looking for pets. They aren’t rubbing up against the guy, they look pretty much like they are politely waiting for him to move so they can enter. 
Any explanation about that floor?  Op ill or does it tactfully help keep it clean?
Let the cats in damnit
*Nicolas Cage stars as Garfield* in **National Treasure 3: Land of the Rising Sun**
Do they ever show up at the same time
I wanna see what they'd do if they got in...I just picture them looking around and going back to the security guy for pets...
Someone please take them home
It says "No dogs allowed,"So iIt has to be our Embassy, and we seek asylum inside.
C’mon, let the cat see Pawcaso. 
Has no one in Japan ever heard of a spray bottle?
This is my cat when I'm eating something with delisiously smelling meat. 
Let the kitty be cultured! 
What if they are ghosts and need to get in the museum to fulfill something to continue to the after life.
Anyone else wonder if these cats are reincarnated artists (or lovers of artists) just trying to reconnect with a past life (or love)?
What if they are reincarnated artists and all they want is to see their work displayed?
Just adopt them and call them attractions.  Everybody wins! 
It seems like they just want the attention.
Someone arm him with a water pistol...
Do we know why they keep wanting to go in?

And why hasn't anyone adopted them yet ;A;
Let them in, they need to go to work. 
LET THEM IN YOU MONSTER
I love how the black one argues with him
They would pee on the art I guess still it's a bit sad they won't let them in..
Just let them in already. Who doesn’t want to look at art and pet cats 
The guard is awesome.
When will the bloodshed end?
Cat burglars?
Am I tripping out, or is the floor moving?
Why don't they just pick the cat up??? 
My cat, Wheezy, has desperately wanted to sleep on the leather Stickley mission couch in my den.  Hasn't given up trying in 3 years.
Those cats look well looked after, l could understand them not wanting them to get inside as cats tend to be unpredictable and one might just decide to get stuck somewhere inaccessible and cause a problem. Not to mention how strong cats pee is, the chances are one in two.
Did they try ringing the bell and saying, "meowminoes"?
The black one flopping over killed me from cute
"I will be back....nothing can stop me. Well....maybe these humans...."

So they're willing to make money off them, but can't let them in? I say set aside an area in the gift shop, poor little kitties. <__>
The cats will win... eventually. 
I kinda wanna see what they’ll do as soon as they enter it
No those cats go there because they know that gets them attention xD
They should adopt them and get someone to create an art piece with them living in it happily. 
You need to let them in! Two years? How long does it *have* to go on before they realize that they know about something the people do not?
What's next:  Humans and cats drinking from the same fountain?
LMAO.  This reminds me of the guy in Legend of Zelda who won't let you talk to the Deku tree until you have a sword and shield. 
This could have been a lot worse if the Japanese didn't believe cats to be gods.
Plot twist: they only come back for the pets :)
Sir, you have mice in the building. Let me do my job. Meow!
Oh, just let 'em in!
LET THEM IN 
This is beyond cute. 
Why don't you let them in?
I appreciate that they just stop them from coming in and aren’t mean. Pretty sure assholes here would throw them.
Let them in!!!!
Let them in!!!  Please.

&#x200B;
Stationed in Japan twice. You don't screw with the cats there. Benjo cats will whoop your ass.
more injustice from the police /s
They need to start working together.
Needs ergonomic training 
May be some ancient ancestors  of theirs is in the museum
The struggle
Imagine being a security guard and this being your only thing you have to worry about 
They should let them in once and see where they go.  They might lead them to whatever is attracting them to the building.

&#x200B;
They love those security guards! Aww!
Is there a restaurant in the museum?
