I set up a Wyze motion camera in my front living room and set it to detect motion.  The first day it was in service, the only interesting video was of it detecting my cat, tracking the cat, and subsequently being tackled by the cat.

I just leave it in stationary mode, now.
That head tilt!!!
    Analyzing....

    Identification: Goodboi
    Status: Mild curiosity
The green square detects where to boop
Im just wondering...did the camera survive? My shepard would have watched it for a few minutes & then mouthed it, then tear it to shreds
That's brilliant!  Cute dog, too.
I see he has his driver license
The maple kind yeah?
I love it. He/she looks like ALF.
Did anyone else legit jump when the dog entered the frame? Felt like I was about to see some Paranormal Activity shit.
Show him/her the video and watch their reaction. Can quickly turn into dogception

Edit:removed a word
So when somebody is walking up to your door amd you dog goes to the window to check it out, the camera turns amd watches the dog instead of the person stealing your Amazon packages?
Wyze Pan Camera if anyone is wondering. I got 3, their fantastic.
Your dog looks like a fruit bat

Dude, when dogs do the head tilt I melt inside. So cah-uuuT!
Meanwhile the front yard is being completely ransacked ....;)
Why are dogs so beautiful?
Do we all agree that only assholes don’t love dogs?
Doggo be like: Excuse me good sir, I think you are in my place.
I do love the GSD head tilt.
Looks like you have electronic AND natural security!
*Dog identified.*
This made my day
Wow Covid-19 has even forced dogs to go into a life of crime. Shame
I’ve watched this 209 times and I’m going to watch it 200 more.
I love watching his paws, so cute
This made me laugh out loud and then almost burst into tears! Damn hormones... I love this video!
Fuck I really want a dog now

That nose hole detection breaks me everytime.
"Um... Mr thing. Does hooman know you're here? I usually patrol this spot."
Why did I instinctively go “hi” when the camera panned up to his face
2019? Why am I only seeing this now? 😡
Who’s a good boy ? Who’s a good boy? You are !
Shepard *and* a camera? That’s some security
I lost it when the green square detected its nostril 😂 sooooo adorable
This is the best thing I've seen in a long time.. the faces..lol
hilarious! time to recalibrate that system
Camera make and model?
What brand and model camera is it?
Awwwww, when the pupper does that cute head tilt, my heart melted. Such a wholesome puppy.
Home protection methods cancelled each other out.
It looks at me? Does it sees me?
Inside job... distraction 100%
I like how the dog has his own employee badge.
My dog would have eaten it somewhere between the second and third movement.
Love the head tilt!
The curiosity of the dog though.
He confused but he puppy
It’s a good thing you have a good security camera because that sweet doogie’s  face wouldn’t scare anyone.
Good boy. We don't really don't deserve dogs.  They are pure and utter soul.
I love the head tilts; so adorable!
Intruder detected, sound the alarm 

Wait, but he is already inside

(Camera Analyses Doggo)

He’s a good boi
We have the same ‘tags for life’ drivers license dog tags!
What kind of camera?
Reminds me of Alf
Plot twist: the dog is in cahoots with the burglers. He's the distraction. We've all been had.
Does that dog have a drivers license!?
Does your dog wear ID tag just while at work or at home too?
I’m sorry, are we talking about the dog or the camera?
Meanwhile four dudes are walking off with your flat screen and jewelry.
Awe, they’re friends :-)
Scared me...
Looks like they already had a good security system
Yup, until it tracks a bird fly up into the sky and then gets stuck looking at nothing.
Camera got the sharingan
Are you talking about the dog or camera... lol
What a handsome boy!
Plot twist that dog was a accually a intruder
Mother of god... someone give that dog a snuggle
My Dogs can hear it move from other parts of the house.  Then runs over and barks at it.  Outside of that Wyze has some good products for the price.

LOL! So funny Just my favorite thing! dogs are the cutest! LMAO! p.s Everyone have a amazing day!
Why was I half expecting him to just eat it
You mean you have 2 security systems that pick up everything
Lol that head turning!
Little doggy head tilts are my Crack.
Favorite video on reddit.

This just made me smile so big
THAT TILT!
Luv this confused doggo❤️😊
I had one of those, it mostly picks up squirrels
He looks like Alf.
We’ve found the night stalker, california can sleep a little easier tonight

Dog is thinking, they want *this* to do *my* job?
My god that dog looked intelligent.
Oh my god 😍.
Good boy detected
That dog is just chock full of character. I mean, I guess all dogs are, but this guy has extra
Imsgine getting a security cam when you already got a 2feet tall German shepherd doc at home... xD
His ID checks out
Who needs a security camera when you have that GSD keeping watch!
I like that the camera seems to be trying to boop
This is definitely a repost
I've seen this posted dozens if times, but it honestly never gets old lol
the big nose angle is what gets me
Sure, the dog is cute, but are we all going to ignore that *completely fucked* mirror behind the dog?
When I'm supposed to get some work done but end up taking some selfies
Nice. So inquisitive. 🙂
Hoping for a fresh Schnoodle!
I have the same pupper and camera. They didn't come as a set.
Hahahaha
The best kind of security!
Hilarious 😂
Woof
Oh my god. I did NOT expect that 😂
Worth every penny
I want that camera!
Top notch!
I want one if they give pics like that
Hahah! What’s his name? He’s beautiful.
Why did you guys need to get a camera to watch your yard/property? It looks like you already had one :).
HAHA! He is NOT fooled!!!! They're waaay more clued in then we give em credit for ;P
I love his little head tilts trying to figure out "what in the hell is this thing?"
Haha I wasn't expecting that 😂😂 so cuteee
The head tilt got me
Great success
This one made me cry.
I hope his name is ALF!
There's a fluffy intruder
Dog's like "Where is your ID, strange looking sir ? You too must wear your badge."
Does the dog have a tiny little driver's license for a collar tag or am I imagining things?
His face 😂😂😂
"What curious sorcery is this!?
Beautiful pupper, great capture of the head tilt!
That head tilt though!
Those are some superb head tilts.  Excellent work, carry on lol
GSD's are so smart
Lol I had to recheck the subreddit before the final reveal. So relieved.
LMAO this is amazing
At first, I thought that was the house from *A Ghost Story* (2017).
I knew what was coming and I still cackled like a witch when it happened
Best thing ever!
I just love Shepards. They have such adorable facial expressions
I'M keeping watch out this window. Who are you??
Both the camera and the dog are wondering "What fuckery is this?"
... & sound from a block away. 👍
This made my day. What a good doggo!!
OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS. thank you so much for the snort.
🤣🤣🤣🤣What a handsome security camera you have!!! Be careful cuz someone might decide they want that exact security camera for there house!👀👀👀
That actually seems like a huge security flaw
You can feel that dog looking into your soul
That head tilt... I'm ded.
I honestly thought it was going to just sit on the shade the entire time. Dog was unexpected. Should have known based on the sub, but wasn't paying attention to it,
Haha. I was waiting for the CHOMP.
Did you turn the camera around? Or did the camera somehow turn to the movement on its own? Which security camera brand/model is this from?
This is the buddy comedy I've been waiting for.
Can anyone tell which security setup is that.

Planning to buy one for myself
Looks like doggo heard voice? What camera is that does exterior and interior in great clarity and has audio!? What
Oh so you got a second one :D
OMG I’m crying.
No cap actually got jumpscared by the dog
But why is the mirror at the end hung diagonally?
Absolutely magnificent creature! Love German Shepherds.
it's just your reflection tho bigfoot
what a cutie
Is it a 360 degree view camera?

I love him.
The doggos like huh whats this thing doing
Looks like this house has TWO excellent security systems. Of course one is clearly the more adorable.
Wyze cam?
*Both the dog and the camera*: "What are you doing here?"
Anyone else notice the green square on the empty mirror?
That’s funny. That’s what my dog would end up doing.
Wyzecam with pan?
Really cute boy..
Alf. That is hit sitcom star from the 80’s Alf.
All you need now is the security cam being able to tilt itself if the dog tilts its head for tiltception
Awwww 😭 hes so precious 🥲
Did anyone else jump? That dog scared the shit outta me.
Detecting... extra floof security.
When it first turns around: **honk**
“Do you know when they are coming home?”
*Doggo detected. Initiating belly rub sequence.*

The dog is so suspicious...is he about to be out of a job?
Big brother is watching.
Home security watching home security!

It’s watching your  real home security system 🤣
Camera is in doggos prime window seat
God damn i love this woofing animal
You aren't talking about the 1st person webcam. You meant the doggo, right?
This made me laugh way to hard 😂🥰❤️
That moment when the camera starts picking up facial recognition outside of the window
Obviously their owner set it up to get cute doggy photos. 🤷🏽‍♂️
Doggo: What sorcery is this?
Such a handsome boy!

This is the deep belly laugh before bedtime I come to Reddit for just about every night. Granted, it usually comes from the comments but your cam dog is my winner of the week!
I'm curious...OP....what camera was this?
I love this soooo much! Wish I had my puppy back! 😞
My heart
I don’t think anyone is going to break into your house when that gud boi is home.
The pupetrator was caught red handed
this looks like valley village in Louisville Kentucky
Funny how you have a camera to watch over your home security system.  🤣
It wouldn't be able to pick up movement behind it, clearly it's being manually rotated. I approve though, clearly goodboi is ready for his closeup.
Seriously thought this was Alf at first
LOL.  Just what I needed right now.  Thanks!
If this was my pup, you would know he was interested if he licked it. Otherwise, he's looking outside!

I find it more funny that the camera thinks the dog’s left nostril is a face.
surprise scooby doo
The head tilt! No matter the critter, the tilt melts my Grinch husk heart.
Wasn't disappointed... Nice one
Your dog looks quite intelligent....love this!!!
Smart boy!
That side eye.... swoon.
My dog just knocks that fluff over. Almost everyday.
dog: what is this strange thing moving in the window? i cant identify it.

camera:  what is this strange thing moving in the window? i cant identify it.
When I see dogs do their head tilts like this, in just pure confusion, I lose myself giggling.

My toto dog Ellie (rip) heard a remix of Fireflies by Owl City that only used cat meows and dog barks and it was head tilts for the solid 3 minutes. I was laughing so hard I was crying.
Looks like a T-800 from the terminator

Excellent footage captured. 10/10 would watch again.

Imagine the dog in the lowest most deep but also soft saying “woof”
That's just adorable.
the only movement that is necessary to be recorded....
This is the cutest thing
I love how it focused on the nose first.
I love his little paws sitting comfortably and I’d like to think both the dog and the camera were asking themselves, “what is it? What’s it doing? It’s moving. Huh. “
Focusing on the important intruders.
Love this
Your mirrors crooked
hahaah that made me laugh! it was so unexpected!

I'm confused. Is this referring to the dog or to the actual camera?
if an angry dog ever attacks you and they're wearing a collar, just grab it, twist and pull up and the dog will lose consciousness and relax it's jaw if he's locked on. The dog wakes up confused but you don't have to kick them or hit them they aren't really trying to be bad usually
Are these dogs really safe w kids around the home?
