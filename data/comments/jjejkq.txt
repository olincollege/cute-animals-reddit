We have heated tile in our bathrooms. The cat is always stretched out on the floor and we need to step around him all the time.
Omg. I need heated tile flooring. Do the extra cats just show up?
They are adorable.  Looks like someone spilled a bag of kittens.
Did they come with the installation? Was it a local contractor?

The floor overheats their processors and the system shuts down, it's a known problem in the cat firmware and can be seen happening when they get to close to other heat sources.

To hell with the cats.

We have this and our cats looooove it! I can always tell where the warm tiles are üòÇ
Is this how you get more cats? Cuz I could always use more cats.
In my entire life I could afford only one month of heated floor tiles (I odnt have that house anymore) and, specialyl since I have allergies all the time, it was the glory... I loved it and would trade it for no other heating system. The only drawback (besides cost) is that it was slow af, but oh god how nice it was to lay on the floor in the winter..
That‚Äôs litter I approve of
I would plop right down on there will that and take a nap.

Sorry to bring this onto everyone. But I imagine a large contributing factor to cats sleeping on you (while yes they definitely love you to do so) is also because your body is constantly emitting heat.

This fact is also the reason blanket work, they trap the warmth coming off your body in the air between you and the blanket.
Well that's just fucking adorable.

I thought they were dead.
I used to live in a house with heated tile flooring, felt like absolute heaven in the winter.
There‚Äôs a group of 4 specific tiles that are heated more than the others in my kitchen, so my cat always sits there too
