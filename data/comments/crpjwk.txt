That’s awesome! Does she let you pet them ?
Do you start to anxious every year waiting for her arrival?
If I don’t see these ducks splashing around in a baby pool within the next few days I’m gonna be very disappointed OP
on the way there she was saying "i can't wait for you guys to meet my good friend, we go back years"
So what you’re saying is...the mama duck scored herself some free daycare through her adorable babies?
Good haul this year! Please post updates 😊
How does one gain the trust of so many quackers?
**Mother Duck:** "You know the drill, human".
How did this get started? Do you consider yourself the grandma of sorts? Are you actually a human sized duck, OP?
If you zoom in on the momma beak it looks like a snake in a duck costume once you zoom back out
At my old house a family of fucks would roost every year. I even made them a duck house. Sometimes they would peck on the door for me to come out and give them seeds

Edit: I have a pic of the fuck house. Can someone tell me how to post it?

Edit 2: thanks to u/oodie1127 (and others) for the tips. Here’s the link: https://imgur.com/gallery/XIa7tC0
I always gave my ducky neighbors oats so they knew that whenever I went out back they were getting fed, and lots of mamas-to-be would nest nearby to get access to the buffet!

At the demands of my family I stopped feeding them for a month or two because they kept pooping on the porch, but there was a significant decrease in the survival rates of new chicks—oats contain niacin, a necessary vitamin for ducks that helps them thrive. After burying so many of the deceased ducklings I snubbed my family’s wishes and got them more oats.

Thank you for being another honorary ducky grandparent!
That is adorable, and a Bakers Dozen no less! You are Natures friend it seems. How long has she been doing this and do have more pics of the fluff balls?
That’s awesome? How did this start?
Are you Tony Soprano?
I was looking at your older posts and, when I grow up, I want to be you.
So I wonder if when the ducklings are older will the mommas remember your house and try to nest there? 

!Remindme 1-2 years
So wait, does she literally just show up at your doorsteps and knock on your door?
One day, in your most dire moment of need, the sky will darken with the wings of a thousand thousand ducks flapping to your aid.

*The Quackening*, coming this summer to a theater near you.
I love the ducks!!!
She's outsourcing care. Life's hard these days for a single mother with 13 kids, you know?
Congratulations on your newest grand-ducklings!
[deleted]
How sweet!  I hope they all survive.  What do you feed them?
/u/fuckswithducks might be a little jealous.
I see a duck, I upvote
Fun fact, depending on how many years this has been going on, this may in fact be a multigenerational learned ability. You see the young females return to where they hatched, figuring that they too will get off a successful hatch. 

You may very well be seeing multi generations come thru.
"Hey look, I got knocked up again...help a Duck out?"
If 13 ducks showed up at my door I'd call them Dwalin, Balin, Kili, Fili, Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, Bombur and Thorin.
13? She has definately adopted a few other clutches lol.
Fun facts: These birds are like dogs, they will beg for food, even catch it if you teach them by dropping it at their begging mouths. They will wag their tails and follow you around like puppies if you raise them. They are a species known as Muscoveys despite people calling them Muscovey Ducks. They are a tree bird native only to the western hemisphere. When bred with a true duck, they produce mules which will be infertile. They have no quack/call, but a hollow chortle and a hoarse hissing sound. They are extremely friendly and learn easily, just don't tease them like you are going to offer them food if you have no intention, as they will bite the hand that doesn't feed it.
How did you make friends with the duck?
do ducks like to be petted?
Keep this up and in 20 years you’ll have a fine duck army
I fed some geese canned corn at the park last month and one bit me 3 times.  Then it chased me to my car and tried getting into the car.  I'm guessing it wanted to bite me again.
Can you give her my address for the holidays?
I’m sure amazon has duck costumes, you could be grandma duck in no time. 🦆
Whats it like being a foster parent?
For the love of God don't count them again everyday or week, you'll be very sad.
So cute.... until they start shitting all over the place
I love this! I was wondering how long they normally stick around for? Do you name them? Do you have a name for the mom? Also, do you ever see the babies after they leave?
My sister has some regulars each year, Mr&Mrs Quack and babies. We live in a UK housing Estate with the nearest river about half a mile away. Every year they come back. She is like Doctor Doolitle though, looks after hedgehogs and foxes. Rescued a rat and took it to the nearby racecourse to let it free. Nurses damaged pigeons etc.
My heart can’t take this! 😭😭😍😍
Hey OP you appreciate you and what you do
Are you Snow White?
I had a duck do this that I named Ronald. Then one day he, or so I thought, brought a few ducklings by and I realized Ronald was actually a Rhonda.
I had one in my flower bed sitting on its eggs in April.  I didnt actually know it was there until my 3 year old daughter sat down next to it too closely and it bit her ear lol.  The ducklings hatched in May, two days after my son was born, had to open the gate to my back yard for 13 little puffballs and their mother.
I'm going to need approximately all the footage you have of these little fuzzballs
Why are some solid yellow and some black and yellow? Does it indicate gender or is it just due to random genetics?
I just have to share my new baby boy Penpen.

You might want to contact Disney for an official recognition that you are a Princess.
This is fascinating! Do you know how/why she decided to come to your house?
I live on a farm and we have a family of ducks on our dam. There are reeds at the back of the dam which are perfect for the ducks making their nest. They don’t come up to our house, but we see them every day either on the dam or wandering around foraging on the farm. I counted 6 when I purchased the farm 13 years ago, but now there is well over a dozen. They are quite use to us however we have to drive past the dam to get out the gate, and sometimes they will block the driveway as if to say, ‘ how dare you drive past our dam’. We just get out of the car and shoo them off the driveway much to their protest.
I want your life.
I wish my life was this cool
I had no idea they could have so many ducklings!
Is it possible to learn this power?
This reminds me of a mama duck that use to raise her babies in my highschools court yard. She returned every year while I was in school and i like to hope she still goes there now! Best part was once they were old enough to leave the school would close down a hallway and open the doors so they could safely walk through the school exit into the outside world. so fucking cute
We need more pictures!!
A mama duck once made her nest under our front bush, and I’d go out there and check on her and the eggs every day. We went away for the weekend, and sure enough, when we got back, there was nothing but broken shells. I was so disappointed. A few days later, I pulled into my driveway after work, looked to my left, and saw a mama duck walking right thru my lawn, with a line of babies behind her. I was so moved, I nearly cried. It felt like mama had come back to show me. It’s still one of my “God is real” moments.
omg thats awsome you are  like a duck whisperer
I wonder if when the ducklings grow up they’ll do the same 🤔
Please never move houses
I would demand duckternity testing, I have a feeling you are NOT the father, and shouldn’t have to pay duckling-support for someone else!
This is freakin awesome.  Serious question, what motherly ducky duties do you assist her with?
I have 2 rescue muscovy ducks and they are so sweet, I hand feed my girls spinach and they go crazy for it, you just can't give them lots of it
Update? Found from upworthy on Insta.
Smart mama duck
"Take. Them. Now."
oh my god.  the duck has a nanny.
You're so lucky. I love ducks.
So are you saying, half of them are yours?
Every year, my sister-in-law does the same thing to me. Much less cute.
You realize you can never move now right? Like... you have to stay in that house forever
Is she leaving them with you to go out partying all night though? Tsk
Muscovy ducks. They are non-native. In some states they are considered an invasive species.
This is adorable. My pups would have a cow!
Tony would be so happy!
This is so incredible!  Thank you for sharing it!   You're an amazing person 💖
Awe. I used to live next to a stream and this one duck would come up every year and lay her eggs in one of our bushes. She’d let us get close to her and her eggs and we’d feed her.
I have to give you major kudos for not only caring about them, but also not feeding them bread.  Everyone please, please, please don't feed ducks, geese, birds, or ANY wildlife bread.  It's terrible for all species but especially for waterfowl.  When juvenile waterfowl eat a lot of bread, they develop angel wing, a condition in which the carpus joint becomes twisted.  If you've ever seen a duck or goose with feathers sticking out from its wings, almost like there's an invisible arrow going through the bird, that's angel wing.  Angel wing renders them basically flightless, unless they're found,  caught, and rehabbed early enough by an experienced waterfowl rehabber.  Which very rarely happens, as you can guess.  It's not a nice way to live and completely avoidable if everyone would stop feeding bread.  Corn isn't the best for them either, but at least it has some nutritional value.  Bread has nothing but empty calories.

Edit: added the part about juvenile waterfowl.
Holy smokes, 106k upvotes at 6 hours!  I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a post blow up so hard.  Nice post OP, I guess you win the Internet today!
You. Can. Not. Tell. Me. That. This. Isn't. Cute
Quality affordable daycare is hard to find.
Regardless of gender, you are a dad now. I hope you're ducking ready.
My grandmother raised a lot of ducks.  There was one that learned to tap on a window each year when it came back.

Thank you for reminding me of that.
Wait. Every year?
So ONCE a year they come ?

So weird .
How many ducks total in 6 years has she brought to you?
This is a muscovy female. We raise them for meat and eggs, they have some of the biggest clutches, one of ours had a clutch of 22 this year.
We’ve located a woodland faerie, all hail the patron saint of ducks!

Seriously though, you are an amazing human and deserve all the internet points and good karma for helping mama and her babies. (My grandma would call them feathers with feet)
If you documented this duck andall the times she's returned, I'm willing to bet you'd have a movie made about your relationship with the duck at some point in the future.
Op is a bad ass. Posting quality feel good content, and not ignoring most comments .

A true redditor. Enjoy the karma guy/girl
I've had a bad day and this post really lifted my mood. I love your duck friend and her babies and I hope you all have fun together. I look forward to any updates.
I had the same bond with some Canada Geese for like three generations. I grew up with a lake in my backyard and they'd come all the way up to the house and peck at my door. I could pet them and they'd eat out of my hand. When I would sun bathe on the dock they'd come float in the water around me. 


To this day I've never been attacked by a goose and I think they all know I'm chill af. And I got the good cracked corn. 


Pretty sure I have a video of them I could dig up if there's any interest.
When I was a kid, a stray cat would bring her kitten every year and live in our balcony.
But how did this tradition start??
[removed]
Honest question, I don’t know how ducks work. Does this mean the chicks will learn to come back as adults? Are you going to end up with hundreds of ducks coming to you in a few years?
I want duck friends!
*Of course they're all yours Jonathan*

I love you
How did this all begin?

Cute but what a freeloader mama duck
How does one become a duck sitter and be entrusted with ducklings. Asking for a friend
Does she knock or just wait till you come out?
So amazing! Thanks for being a decent human being! 🤗
How does something like this begin?
I'm pretty sure I would be excitedly waiting for this duck every year, being slightly melancholic but also happy that they found their way.
Co-parenting at its finest
This story and picture, made my day  🏡  🦆🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤🐤
I just imagine the mama duck coming and ringing the doorbell. Don't tell me otherwise.
I want the back story on how this relationship with you and the duck started. 

Basically, I want Duck Tales
The primary way I get affection from my girlfriend is by showing her pictures of ducks, thank you for your contribution.

Look at all those chickens.

Jokes aside, it's nice to see things like this when so much shit is happening around the world. This really brightened up my day. Thank you.
Alternate universe Tony Soprano where he leaves the mob to go straight in s1.  By s13 the ducks have come back and his marriage has never been better.

You go alternate universe Tony, you go.
You mean to tell me that this momma duck crossed species to find a baby sitter that she can trust over the years with ever batch of offspring...? r/humansbeingbros
Omg that’s so precious!!

She’s like, “here they are!!” “Come see my latest babies.”

No wonder I like animals more than people!
What type of duck is that?! Everyone keeps ignoring me when I ask😂I don't want a upvote I just wanna know bc  I'mm really into birds.
Maybe u answered but, how many years has it been/ how did it start?  

I had a stray cat mama that would always give birth on my sisters balcony (she randomly had one connected to her room).  

We actually took her babies by mistake the 1st time thinking they were abandoned. She found the kits on the balcony and made it her birthing spot.
So you realize you can never move from your house right?
You're the chosen one!

I used to have this relationship with ducks years ago at my parents house. Only difference is the ducklings would jump all over me and I was allowed to pick up the ducklings. I love their tiny little wings
It’s very nice 👍 🤗
That’s Muskovy ducks for you always looking out for the lill ones
It's gonna be a sad year when she doesn't show up.
Love ducks. Muscovy are the best!
What did you originally do to get her to love you??
The floofest in the whole wilde west
I hope you have no plans on moving during that duck's lifetime.
That is so adorable. That mama duck trusts you to show you her babies, as well as hold them and take care of them, and that's an honour not to be taken lightly.
some people are really lucky to have these disney moments happening to them irl, im jealous of you op.
Muscovy ducks are the beeest!
Omg. This is awesome! How do you help? What an amazing opportunity to have a unique relationship!

I had a duck in the Netherlands aswell she would always go infront of our house with their new young duckies it lasted for years miss that damn duck..
Okay Tony
You are a disney princess!!!
That type of duck is a muscovy duck in case anyone was curious!
My sister had this happen with mom and 4 baby turkeys.

Waaaaay less cute when it's turkeys...

I skimmed your profile and you seem like such a magical person 💖 Keep it up and post updates (please)!!
Babysitting is expensive.

This duck has got the right idea
So what you're saying is you can never move. Think about how sad that momma duck will be.
Get them in a row!
Wow
That is so cute

This is so amazing. I am new to Reddit and already like the stories and the support and comments everyone offers on here.
Came to Reddit for some cheering up after watching some asshole run over a baby duck, and of course what do I find at the top of r/all?
This story and the comments are uplifting!!!
so when can I show up?
Are you by any chance a Disney Princess?
This is so special, made my day.
Shes just getting you to pay child support
This post is fowl.
That's amazing.
Why can't this happen to me?
You need to find the dad and male him pay child support. Damn dead beat duck dads
You're the momma ducks babysitter
How much do you BILL them for the daycare services?
Thats cool, My dad has pet deer. He lives on a lakefront in a park and every winter they come to his house and he feeds them. There was this one antlered older one and he could go out and pet it while he fed it. 

The little bastards would come and stare in the windows. 

He use to feed foxes too but they peed on the deck and it stunk to much so he stopped. 

Funny thing is he use to be a avid hunter, had numerous heads mounted, bear rugs. I went away to school and my childhood dog passed away and he stopped hunting and now feed them lol. 

I mean its not like you dont respect the animals when you hunt them but its still kind of funny he did a huge 180.

I'm surprised none of the little ones come back with their little ones.

Been watching a flock hatch about once a week all summer.  Couple hundred living around my stray cat colony. They are pretty cool, ducks. They suragote for other mothers. They bond for life. They buddy up in groups. I've really grown fond of them this summer.

Just be careful, if I learned anything from *The Soprano's*, when they leave things are about to come unglued for you.
Waiting next year!
That is too sweet!!
Awwww
“Every year” yeah that’s a huge fucking lie
This is what the world needs! Keep up the good work pal!
Oh, no. 13 is bad luck. I’ll take one, if it means you’ll be safe.
I always get sad when I see posts like this because one day OP will be gone or the duck will be gone and it will be over, leaving everyone heartbroken.
What sort of things do you do to take care of them? Not saying I plan on doing the things for ducks in my pond, but I definitely plan on doing what you do for the ducks in my pond.
Mama duck is cheating evolution
Which Disney princess are you?
What colour are the yellow ducklings when they're fully grown?

OMG YOU'RE SO LUCKY AND BLESSED!
May I ask how you help her? She seems so absolutely comfortable to come on over. I just love this!!
I think you’ve just earned the title of my favorite person, kind stranger. This makes me so happy.

Are these Canadian geese?  No?  Carry on then.
Who are you?  Tony Soprano in real life?
Mommy duck is so smart,she got a nanny for free. Lol
So every year this mama duck has a whole mess of kids or is it one of her children have kids and you help them?
You can never sell your house now
Tony soprano would love this.
"Alright human, these things don't take care of themselves. Get to it!"
If you ever decide to sell your house you’re going to have to include a “duck care clause” in the purchase agreement. 🙂. I bet mentioning the annual duck duty would be a selling feature to some folks.
So is your house for sale? Asking for a friend.
What do I have to do to get a mama duck to bring her babies to me???
This would make a lovely TV show or picture book ... getting to see her new babies every year. 

You're fantastical.  🐣🐥💓🐥🐣
Duck to other duck: "I don't know how you do it, so many seasons It's been so hard to raise these ducklings and yet you seem to come out on top"

other duck: "ha yeah, I just go to this human and they do most of the work for me"
You're a Disney princess! 😍
You're kind. I'd just eat all of them.
That's adorable, i'm sure you'll help her out a lot.
After some standard creeping and new found admiration for your cat, I am wondering, how does your cat not deter them?
I really needed to see something like this, thank you ❤
Can you start taking pics every year?
Awwww ❤ 😭
How do I apply for the position of your life?
It's hard being a single Mom man
I need to see their visit next year, OP! I’m sure everyone else would love to see it too
This is one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen! Please take good care of them always! ❤️
Ducks are the perfect animal. They can walk, they can fly and their body is a boat. They can sleep and float at the same time
I used to raise ducks.. 😊
They're just Water Kittens.  💖
does she at least not poop on your sidewalk??
This is so wholesome, I'm gonna start blubbering like a baby.
its crazy to me how animal know when you are a good human
I enjoy the thought that this momma duck has like a regular pediatrician that she takes all her kids to see.

Edit: Surely there’s a good “quack doctor” joke here
Is there a yearly subscription service I can sign up for to get this too?  Need this in my life.
My friend, you are quite impressive.  Well Dr. Doolittle, whats next... the Peabody Hotel in Memphis?
Where does she live though?
This is a thing. I live on a lake and it happens to us as well, except she uses one of our boat houses and for 3 years in a row I think it was the same male hanging around. Its super cool. 

Glad to see it happens to others as well. We have a couple of cats that are scared shitless of her, this was settled a few years ago when they(cats) went in to the boat house and were snooping around and I guess they got too close for her liking and literately attacked them by flapping her wings and making this loud shrieking noise I've never heard a duck make before. Well needless to say they ran outta there as fast as they could, and are scared of most birds that are duck size now, and they almost never go in that boat house. 

I think is amazing that they can make it back the the exact spot every year, she's super chill with us and maybe she does the same kind of thing at someone's place house down south in the winter. Cheers.

OOOOHHHH DUCKLINGS!

TOo old to be a duckling, quack quack
This'll get buried but I am curious about her rate of breeding. Does she have more and more ducklings every year? If so, I wonder if she is making more babies because she's able to bring more to maturity, with your assistance. Curious.
Your life is like a Disney princess and they even were polite enough to knock. I am jealous.you are a good egg. 🥚
Three of them look kind of like the mailman tho.
Idk about anyone else being interested in this, but she looks like a Muscovy that went mostly wild. I know of no other ducks with the red bumpy area around her bill and eyes.

This is beautiful and those awards are definitely well deserved.

Muscovy ducks are cool and a problem at the same time. I had one that was hand raised from an egg and he became hyper aggressive.

Our peking ducks was great and we did not have any problems. They were great for the kids.
She allows you to touch them?  Can you tell us more about this relationship?

This needs a times lapse video from when they show up until they leave. I would love to watch this story.
For some reason I didn't think ducks were this intelligent
What do you need to do to take care of them when duck momma comes?
Hella lot of ugly ducklings though
I'm jealous!
@cofava
You could start a duckling blog/vlog!
This is the best thing on my internet today
You should talk to her about safe sex.
I’m not crying, I just wanna know who’s cutting onions?
Bunch of baby ducks, send them to the moon.
That's living.
Single mothers, am I right?
I'm so jealous!  How do I get a gig like that?
This nearly made me cry over the sweetness. Nearly. I'm doing well today
I need to hear the year 1 story
These are startlingly handsome ducklings.
Well what are you waiting for? Let them in!
I don't know a lot about ducks, but this seems unusual
OP. This is the best. And you’re the best.
How new is your house?  The ducks have, in all likelihood, been nesting there for decades and continue going back even after the construction has taken place.

&#x200B;

Saw this with geese in Mississauga where new commercial/industrial development was going on; it made me wince back the tears that they were now trying to nest in some puddles on what was more, rather than less, a construction site and in years gone by had been a shallow wetland.
I could cry, this is so freaking cute. I can't handle it.
Have you been ducking court ordered support?
How many years do ducks remain fertile?
Heartwarming
Never count the ducklings
I hope you know you can never move house now
Just out of curiosity...Do you live in New Jersey?
She must really trust you to keep bringing her babies to you each year.
All in all it’s just another duck on your wall.
“Mom, the grandkids are here.”
This is honestly the kindest and sweetest thing I’ve seen all week
It's like a cuter muscovy duck.
Yes hello, Duckling day care, got another batch for you.
That's so sweet. Why does she do that? How do you help her? My kids school has a mother duck that returns every year that all the kids are super protective of. It's so adorable
That's a Muscovy Duck, where do you live? Like Mexico?
Duck Season!
I'm always amazed when wildlife seek humans for help. It's a fascinating bond.
Kids, I’d like for you all to meet my old friend. Now momma is just gonna go shopping for a little while, alright? Be good to the human!
This is one of the most adorable things ive seen ❤
OP, please never move. Imagine that poor mama going back to your house and you don’t live there anymore. So sad.
Hi! Long time no see. I made these
how did this arrangement start?
"You shouldn't feed strays! They'll just come back!"

"Hopefully, yeah."
RemindMe! 2 days
Wow she must really trust you
Momma knows what's best
I'm curious as to how this tradition started.
Smart birb, free food and babysitter
Disney prince/princess confirmed.
The mamma duck is your personal friend or just use you to do dirty work?
muscovy ducks...nuisance species here in Florida
This sounds like the best life.
Thank you Gran'ma Duck!
Is this your wife?
How did you first meet the mother if you don't mind sharing? Did she have a bunch of ducklings with her on your first encounter or was she hurt and you rescued her back to health so now she trust you?
Mama Duck sporting the warpaint.
I feel like this relationship is what inspired the "A Bunch of Baby Ducks" episodes of Regular Show. I hope your ducklings turn out as cool as those ones.
That is just a lovely story
Oh man, as someone who has helped friends on their duck farm, I feel like I can hear this picture. The sounds are still super cute at that age tho.
Welp, hope you were never planning on moving!
Did this duck walk up to the lemonade stand??
Have you named them?
 this melts my heart 😢😢😢 so beautiful.
Wow, she has babies every year? She is a professional duck maker
This guy ducks
I want them allllllll
Lucky
How did you do this? How did you get to be the luckiest person on the planet?

Asking for a friend.
There are no words in human language to describe my jealousy.
 We will need updates
Aww, I also have a muscovy mama that brought her babies to my house a few months ago. The babies are all grown up now. I’ve been wondering when the babies will all fly off on their own but those little buggers have been coming back every day even though they’re fully grown...
I had a Muscovy as a kid I named Mama Duck. :'(
When their really young like that fill a painters tray with water for them to swim in so they have a shallow and deep end
Mmmmhh, roast duck with plum sauce, finger licking good.
We always had Muscovy ducks around when I was a kid. They don't quack, they're peaceful and good-natured. Highly recommended.
Ugh, another quack head single mother mooching off the welfare state...
You need to read Mother Bruce.
test
Unspoken built relationships, the best kinds of relationships.
I think she wants to hire you as a nanny for the reason. Make sure to add food to her bill
Tony?
how did this start?
Hopefully you see this OP because I really need answers. How did this even start?
this is truly the most adorable thing i have ever heard or seen
I ducking hate those animals kinda cute tho
Thats a survival strategy
How many years has the mama duck been doing this?
I really hope one day the chicks start coming back with their new families!

/u/fuckswithducks stay away
You are blessed. Not even afraid of you. This stuff breaks my heart.
How did mamma duck chose you?
I would love to party with these ducks.
Imagine get so annoyed with your new born duck kids that you try to give them to some random guy every year by going to his door so they can start to see him as their new mother
Wow  your soace is truly blessed,properity will always visit you. Remain blessed.
This is recommended based on my location? Interesting
I wish I could have those docks for an hour too ...

"Excuse me, is Karl home?
Can you describe how you help?  I'm curious.
Such cuties
Hey I gotta do duck things . Watch the kids
Names?
Dude, can you vlog this shit, please?
Look at the love in the mama's eyes, incredible. Btw OP how does one start a relationship like this?
Best thing I’ve read/seen all week!!!!
Yeet!!
"Hey, got any grapes?"
Awww sounds like good luck for all of you.
Every year?! We, we need yearly updates.
My daily dose of wholesome has been fulfilled
just cause you didn't plant the seed doesn't mean you can't love the tree
!Remindme 2 days
Does this mean you now can’t move. New owners may be in for shock.
If this photo was any cuter it would be illegal!
[Everyone liked that]
THAT IS SO CUTE
RemindMe! 1 Year.
Why did the duck cross the road? To get to OP’s house
How do you help? Really wonder 'bout that.
this is the cutest ever!!
Why are some ducks brown and some yellow? What determines this?
Adorable, all of them.
How did this start originally?
Where's the father? OP is encouraging bad behavior.
regular show
Cool. What do you do with them? Feed them? Let them sleep in your house?.
That’s so kind of you! So cute!!!
The duck song
Can you send her to my house?!
You can never move
I require video proof of the peeping noises
How do you help her?
What kind of duck is this? me and a friend got home drunk one night to one just standing in the middle of the road, we herded it to the back yard it didn't make a single attempt to fly and left some water by the morning it was gone. Now we see it every so often wandering the streets at night. From NZ not common here as far as I know.
There better be an album in our future haha
Ah, you are a hero we didn't know we needed!
I'm jealous but so happy
yeah, we're gonna need an IG link
“Mother’s Duck Out”
You know the named of the three yellow ducks ?

Huey, Dewey en Louie.
my parent's friends have a farm in the Philippines! when I was little I'd play with the little  chickens and I'd get scared of the momma duck thinking it'd be mad i was holding its baby
Ducks eat free at subway.
