Please get him a tweed suit and a snappy hat to match

I wonder if dogs we find good looking are also good looking to other dogs or if they have different criteria.
BOLT 2.0
What breed is he?
But can he turn left??
Like a young canine paul newman.

Well if you love him so much why don't you marry him
Absolutely

Says every dog owner everywhere
....he single? (Asking for a friend. REALLY.)
He surely is.
And knows it and owns it in the best possible way.

WOOF.
What breed is he?

He should be on the cover of r/dogue !
A very regal pooch

I agree!  Our Kane looks just like him!
BTW, he is definitely a White Shepherd, as stated in other comments.   He‚Äôs nearly identical to ours, giant ears and all.   Their back will be straight, not sloped like the modern GS.
Woah buddy it‚Äôs a dog...
Stay away from it
I would date him

For a second I misread "dog" as "god" and thought, "Yup, that makes total sense, dogs are gods."
He's got that "what is this, a school for ants??" look.

Ok your dog looks like my grandmas dog dusty so I have to tell you this story now.

When I was like 10 I said ‚ÄúGranny when you die can I have Dusty?‚Äù

She laughed and said ‚ÄúHoney I‚Äôm going to live a lot longer than the dog.‚Äù

She did too. 

Dusty passed away at 12 or 16 years old and my grandma was one of the first two people in her entire family to live past 65.
Speaking of handsome dogs... https://imgur.com/Ho1PpJa.jpg

I have a feeling your username is what your dog says a lot
I misread the title as "My dog is really, really ridiculous-looking" so I clicked, 'cause I've got a soft spot for the most butt-ugly dogs (our previous dog looked like he was built from spare parts and we named him Grendel).

I was disappointed.

That really is a really, really good-looking dog.
This is the guy that not only steals your girl, but also gets you to give him belly rubs at the same time.
I didn‚Äôt believe you at first but this boye IS RIDICULOUSLY good looking
Upvote for actually calling your dog a dog.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to steal yo bitch‚Äù - Doggo, probably
Random fact; the AKC does not consider the White version of the German Shepherd a true breed, simply because they wouldn't make good sheep herding dogs (due to their white color, they would blend in with the sheep), which is what the German Shepherd's were bred for.

This means that White German shepherds aren‚Äôt able to compete in Shows run by the AKC.
He‚Äôs got a real Harrison Ford viben
awww... a handsome boi...
Ridiculous.
Beautifull üñ§
OMG. I am in love.

He's like the Chris Hemsworth of dogs.

That dog qualifies as a better looking human than me.

I hope he ages like fine wine and Keanu Reeves
Disagree, only one color, ugly ass coat
My god, I used to hang out with a guy in statesboro Georgia with a dog as beautiful as that. Same colors same look and everything.
He knows
He is looking good!
What makes a dogs ears stand up or flop down? Your dog looks like my dog, but my dogs ears lay down instead of stand up.
Yup! Sure is.
I have no idea who you are but I love you. 

I also think my dog is ridiculously good looking and have thought that about with every dog I‚Äôve ever had. I see other dogs and agree it looks magnificent but as a dog parent it‚Äôs something about your dog that catches you. It‚Äôs probably why parents keep showing pics of their kids.
So Handsome, man I‚Äôd be honored to pet him but he is so handsome like you‚Äôd pause to be nervous to pet him like meeting a celebrity and be star struck but with pets
I want to talk to him. I feel like he would listen.
Kinda looks like Harrison Ford?
Dog looking fresh
nice hot dog
This guy dogs dogs
Is that magnum?!
For anyone who looks a good old fashioned optical illusion, if you scroll up and down really fast on the photo it looks like the bars on the grate to the left are bending
What a dog.
That is one handsome baby.
This is the Jon Hamm of dogs.
White swiss shepards are the most beautiful dog breed I have ever seen.
What breed is he? He looks similar to my border collie but hes not border collie colour
You have the German Shepard version of my English cream golden retriever!
Good boi
I imagine that Richard Gere is the voice of this dog
Honestly I think this is an average looking dog. Coat seems like its sort of taken care of, at least well brushed, not exceptional shine, ears seem too big for face, doesnt have striking eye color, not strikingly built either. Kind of what pops in my head when someone just says dog.
Meh
I wouldn't say no
Can I pet your dog? Would make me so happy!
Classically handsome
Why yes, yes he is. Handsome good boi.
I didn't think I'd need to say this today but don't fuck your dog.
he's the Harrison Ford of puppers
Facts.
I'm ignorant on dog breeds. What breed is this beautiful pupper?
Lady-killer...
That dog should be in the movies. ...in movies made about dogs for dogs by dogs.
This picture made my mom smile because your dog looks like the dog she had fourty years ago. Much love!
Make puppers and give me one! My goodness, what a handsome fellow
Mr. Steal your girl , so handsome.
Doggo: Stop pointing that flat ringy thing at me and come play..
So handsome!
White German shepherd?
Very handsome indeed üòä
When the dog is more handsome than the owner... That would be my case at least.
Looks like a white German Sheppard -- somewhat rare. 

We had one as a kid, she was a great dog. Although I remember my father telling me they were more at risk/genetically weaker due to them typically being inbred in order to maintain the recessive genes trait of having a white coat.
The goodest of bois
That dog is so hot right now!
He looks very down to earth and humble about it.
young Paul Newman of dogs.
Uh...I don't see it. You ask me, looks like a total dog, woof. (Very handsome really, just an attempt at a bad dad joke,lol)
I feel like you want to fuck your dog. Don't fuck your dog.
What breed is this good boi?
Bolt!!
So he is!

Your dog is good looking.  If that were my dog it would cheat on me with another owner.

If you dont know who she is, look it up
Keep the peanut butter away from this guy. He thinks his dog is good looking, and they are in quarantine. No one would ever know.
NO...  your pup is beautiful and sweet. So handsome.  Are you sure youre not looking in a mirror?
Like Gregory Peck and George Clooney had a baby that was a dog
He definitely follows rules 1 and 2.
I'm 100% going going to draw your dog in a few days... remind me
Why male models?
Need a pic without that collar.
Yes, yes he is
Awww! Who's a handsome boy?
She is photogenic, the camera really loves her. You really could look into her doing some modeling. Any sort of dog food, treat, toy, vet service etc she would be perfect for. Paw modeling is also a growing category (I'm talking classy stuff, not the other kind). There are agents who exclusively rep pets but you need to be a little bit careful in choosing. Some of them are known treat pushers and a couple are actually just dog walkers. Anyway, if you could send me pics in a variety of poses and situations (don't be shy!) I could maybe hook you up with some pretty  heavy hitters.
This looks like Polar who was adopted from my local shelter a while ago
He should get married
Yeah, but is he an ambi-turner?

Now who could argue against that?
Hey there, how u doin ...üòâ
White German Shepherd?? I had  giant one when I was growing up. He was the greatest. Name was Atlas. Your dude looks just a bit different though so maybe I‚Äôm wrong on the breed?
Why does he reminds of Anderson Cooper?
Is that a bottle opener on his collar?
"Dog Flaunter!"  Just use the voice of the unfortunate aunt from the original Vacation movie.
That is one handsome fucking dog.
He needs a bowtie lol
I know the effect I have on bitches
Are you wearing a tie to impress the dog?.... Do you think he noticed?
He looks like Harrison Ford if he were a dog. I‚Äôm not sure why I thought that
Very very handsome. Like Chris Pratt when he gets fit for a movie.
You weren‚Äôt kidding! Actually laughed out with happiness when I saw this.

Wow!!!
I get a kind of Harrison Ford vibe from him
I think you like your dog too much.
You ain't lying
Aw, such a noble buddy!
Ya know what...yes he is!
Apparently a deceased British actor was reincarnated as your dog. Maybe Alec Guinness or Roger Moore.
he is more handsome then... Oh forget about it
It's a walk off...to the park.
Agree!
But can he turn left?
owh, do you want a cup of tea homan
I know how you feel, so it's mine.
Is your dog a white shepard? I have a good looking boy as well. My good boy has a little shorter hair though.
Yup you are correct
He is the dog version of Richard Gere.
And your dog knows it, too!  ;)
Your dog looks like his human name would be Brad.
Is this a German Shepard?
Racist

He‚Äôs a handsome boy üòä

It appears he can't read though, you should send him to the school for dogs that can't read good.
I dont know him but i would die for him
He looks like he's not mad, but disappointed in my recent life choices.
Cute, but not as good looking as my pugs
He has a thumbs up in his left ear.
He needs a bowtie!
The name is Dog...James Dog.
Beautiful sea cow!
Yeah, he really, really is
indeed!
Hey I know cabin fever is a thing and the dogs are immune to covid19 but I think you should give your dog some social distance
Perhaps a bow tie
What type of dog? Such a beautiful dog
ONE WORD

Super handsome
Seriously dude your dog is the Patrick Swayze of dogs. Effortlessly gorgeous.
Accurate title right there.
WelI I mean I hope so! He was bred to look that good.
immediately thought of Mike Rowe for some reason. hmm.  . .
He's definitely /r/Dogue material.
Your dog is way too good looking
Wasnt there a bear or a gorilla or something that was unnervingly good looking by human standards a while back?
Hansel, *so hot right now*
I used to have a Berger blanc Suisse Named Thor. He was an awesome dog
The Chad of dogs üò≥
It's a beautiful dog, but the way this caption is phrased sounds like someone is not handling quarantine well.  üòÇ
Looks kinda ruff tbh
He‚Äôs a regular George Hamilton.

I'm sure someone has commented on this in the +1k comments already, but it's really interesting to me how concepts of beauty transcend species.  I mean, this dog is objectively handsome.  How is it that we all see this?  Is it proportion?  Is it radiant health?  Is it his calm and confident demeanor?  Someone could do a graduate study on this.
What a silver fox! Giving off Ted Danson vibes
I have a Swiss Shepherd as well. Hands down the best dogs.
Why was the first I thought of was "Alan Rickman" ?
