I’d pay to sit on your patio
My parents have had a family of foxes that come to their yard every summer for a few years now. I know nothing about the behavior of foxes, but if my parents are any indication, Todd should return.
Where is this?  He’s beautiful, but a different type of fox , at least from the generic one in my head, he’s very leggy.   Very cool, hope he becomes a regular.
That movie still makes me cry. Hope Todd comes to visit you!
That is one of the most beautiful foxes I have ever seen.  I hope he comes back to visit you too!
Why does this look animated? Am I watching too much cgi stuff?
Can we talk about how pristine that truck is?
Fine with me, let him screech in *your* yard at 2am
Tod: OP, you’re my very best friend. 

OP: And you’re mine too, Tod. 

T: And we’ll always be friends forever, won’t we?

OP: Yeah, forever.
“are you -“
“wearing the new chanel boots? yea, I am”
Now the real question...

What does Todd say?
He has boots!🥺
I would think it would be annoying with him going "wapapapapapapow! Wapapapapapapow!" all the time.
How about that OBS tho! damn that thing is sexy
Oh how adorable! We used to have a momma with kits that would use the underside of our shed as a den. 

I love this guy but I am also concerned. I hope it's looking at a camera and not a person with a camera. I say this because it dangerous for the animal. They become comfortable with people and will approach other people. Those types of animals are usually the ones that are trapped and killed. Just as a general PSA, please don't befriend wild animals. It for their safety and yours.
Todd!  Aww?  Is there a Copper?
Todd ! Fox and the hound reference ?? Love it
Lol I live on a golf course and it has a couple family’s of foxes. One fox in particular likes golf balls and will regularly run out of its den and steal a ball off the putting green on  hole 7. I really really want to see it’s den cause I’m sure it has HUNDREDS of balls. It’s got at least 10 of mine.
Todd is adorable! 
As a word of warning, if you ever come into contact with any of his bodily fluids (blood/ saliva), get the rabies vaccine ASAP. Milwaukee protocol is not a bet I'd stake my life on.
That truck is MINT!
The person who reads this comment, Have a good day! 🐼
Just remember that Todd is still a wild animal. Treat him with the respect that demands.
A cat in a doggo's body.
Todd. Adorable and varmint inhibitor - he would be welcome in my garden.

PSA please don't feed or habituate wild animals for their own survival.
Follow it , It'll lead you to a shrine.
Maybe he’s looking for Copper. ❤️
Todd isn’t the fox. Todd is the homeless guy recording.
I love that you named him TODD, after Disney's Fox and the Hound...🦊🐕
Foxes are mentally cats in a dog’s body… prove me wrong….
Is he wearing the Chanel.....?
Do you own a herse?
I love you named him Tod! The Fox and the Hound was such a great movie.
In my experience foxes STINK. Like skunk levels of smelly. Was this a problem with him living there or is it only certian types of foxes that it is a problem with?
Chaos reigns.
u/farmercurtis
When you're the best of friends, sharing all that you discover... Life's one happy game!
That truck looks really clean, I like it
If you used to feed him regularly I don't think he's coming back :(
Nice
what a fashionable fox. Loving the thigh-high boots 😍
Todd from the fox and the hound?
Todd! The fox and the hound 😭😭😭 I’m 100% crying
Is that liatris in the background?
Do you have a hound dog?
That car tho
I don’t know what’s more beautiful...the fox or the square body. Damn.
If not you can always get a shibu inu.
That truck is awesome! what is it? Some sort of Super Duty? What year?
Wanna sell that truck?
If you like foxes, I highly recommend the Save a Fox Youtube channel.
i guess the garden is proportional to the car behind there
He has some cool socks
My coworker who passed away in august loved foxes and also had one in his yard. His name just so happened to be Todd. Thinking of you dude
That’s a nice truck
He is cute but since he is a wild animal he can be dangerous.
Cool fox!  Even cooler truck!!
Nice truck, is it a daily or a toy?
[deleted]
Kinda off subject but I like that clean f350.
Todd is adorable and I love the name! That truck is absolutely beautiful though!
That dually is so clean
Watching this, I found myself sitting extremely still and holding my breath because I didn’t want to scare him off.
Did you get the name Todd from Fox and the Hound per chance? Used to watch that movie all the time as a kid.
Everyone: cute fox omg
Me: truck owner loves his truck omg ❤️
Aw, did you name him after the fox from The Fox & the Hound?
He’s so handsome, I want a fox visitor
Todd? Like the fox and the hound Todd?
I am in love with that truck
Thats one clean dually in the back
Truck looking clean af
Y’all not gonna mention that beautiful truck? Really?
Killer truck in the background
Give me your 7.3
That Ford in back too though.
yo that truck is sick btw!!
Clean ass obs
Not to be dramatic, but I would die for Todd
The fox is cool but we gotta talk about that beautiful obs Ford in the background.
Everyone's talking about the truck, and I'm just here wondering if those  flowers are Blazing Stars??
As long as Copper stays cool and Major doesn’t get his way...
This. This is why you are always getting rabies.
That’s a nice truck
That looks like a clean ass OBS Ford dually.
What a beauty
That truck tho
Nice vehicle
Awww, that’s the prettiest F350 that I have ever seen😍
The fox is awesome but can you please post a video of that obs crew cab dually god damn that's a nice truck
Please update with Todd pictures upon his return!
sweet F-350! looks super clean
Hey anyone know what the purple flower is?
Did you feed him?
You need a hound named Copper... and possibly an older one named Chief, in order for it to work.

;)
that contour and eyeliner
That trucks is so damn sexy
That might be one of the nicest old crew cabs I’ve seen in a long long time
Please don't encourage acclamation to humans by wild animals.
He’s beautiful but we should respect wildlife and not acclimate them to humans. This puts them as risk if they becoming trusting, since many sick people will harm them, try to take them as pets, etc. Sounds like overreacting I’m sure but when you go to National Parks that advise you of this as well. I mean this politely and just as something to consider, but will anticipate the downvotes anyway.
He just likes people with good taste in trucks..
That fox is adorable but man tell me about that sweet obs
My old hunter of a dad once had a wild fox become friends with his hound dog.
Is that a fucking 4WD Hearse?
Nice truck!
Imagine being a gorgeous wild animal who stumbled upon a beautiful garden and decided to spend his summer there and then some hairless ape names you Todd
The ears! The snout! The poise!!!!
The word "tod" is middle English for fox so this is fabulous to me. :)
What did the fox say?
Waiting for the shill in the comment section saying something wrong about the video

Super cute fox
I swiped my screen a little just as Todd got startled, and I actually felt bad…like I made him jump. Beautiful animal.
Is that a truck or a hearse?
Sweet truck tho
I would like to know more about the truck pls! Looks beautiful
that's a very nice f350 what year is it
Fox aside, I freakin love your truck
So...you’re saying you don’t keep chickens?
*Tod
All fun and games until that fox decides to bite you or your beloved pet. Let wild animals be wild...... 🙄😔
[deleted]
That fox is going to end up dead because he’s not scared enough of humans. Don’t feed wild animals people. It is not good for them.
So, do people usually live with foxes in their backyard in cities?

I mean we live on the city outskirts in europe, and if a random fox waltzed in the yard, there would be veterinary inspection, health department, wildlife services called faster than you could say fox. That fox would have been removed and relocated, possibly tested for rabies. No one would film it from couple of meters and bond with it.
Todd is gorgeous!  The foxes we have are much smaller versions of Todd but still extremely curious!
Todd definitely pissed on all your flowers.
Follow it… might lead you to a shrine
So handsome!
Keep us posted!!
Hi Todd, please come back.
He looks like a Todd lol
Foxes are stunning
Heres to Todd coming back 🥂
hey its me ur doge
are you wearing th- 
the chanel boots? yeah i am
Who names a fox Todd? Come on, you could have chosen Jamie, Redd, Vivica or Michael J.
Never knew how beautiful foxes are, especially their eyes, until fb's algorithm started showing me videos of that hot tatted up chick with the fox sanctuary.
Todd prob likes that super clean rig you got there. Wants a ride
I would die for Todd.
How bout that obs
I like the black legs. He’s got thigh highs on
Cute fox and all but I’m more interested in that sassy black beauty behind it.
Such gorgeous animal. Excellent video.
alright but can we mention that absolutely STUNNING OBS dually???
Beautiful
I know this is about the fox but that truck is beautiful as hell.
I wish to pet the forbidden dog.
Imagine a whole stupid culture around terrorizing small creatures with such ears and faces
That OBS 🫀
That's a clean looking OBS Ford for being in Ontario(reading through comments). 

Fox is great too, we have a couple in our neighborhood as they just live in the creek behind the houses. Not as friendly though. Also in Ontario myself.
It’s the crew cab obs dually for me
Wow that is the cleanest nicest obs I've ever seen
I'm going to curl up on my couch tonight and watch this movie and then cry myself to sleep.
Forget Todd, sweet truck!!
Is he named after the fox in Disney's "The Fox and the Hound"?
Nice truck
That’s clearly Kristofferson. He’s a natural.
Off topic, nice OBS ford
Nice truck! Looks like it's in amazing condition!
He’s beautiful!  Just like a cat & dog mixed together. Couldn’t ask for a better pet!
Did you name him that from the Fox and the Hound? I had a record of that with a book, pre-vhs was a wild time! 💜🦊
That's a clean OBS!
Adorable fox!  And that Ford in the background is sharp!
You named him Todd. Omg. I’m going to come over here and just chill with my childhood trauma.
I hope he does too  he's a handsome lil guy
What a majestic little fella
Look. I know it’s unsafe in so many ways to try to befriend wild animals. BUT. Cute cat dog sniffle huge paws boy.
Everybody gangsta till u get rabies
Im more intrested in that truck... what is it?
OP what country do you live in? That might be a Maned Wolf. Edit: range of Maned Wolf: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maned_wolf
...Todd looks a couple days shy of rabid...
He/She looks adorable hoewever he might carrying some serious disase :/
Deercatdog

Very handsome and sweet. Reminds me of the family of foxes that would visit me at work and brighten my day. I hope he returns this year!
Just get some chickens
Those big ol ears!!! 🥰 So cute
wish I had foxes near me
“Todd you’re my very best friend, and we will always be friends forever won’t we, yeah forever!”
- Fox and the Hound🤧🤧😥😥😥
He's like the perfect combination of a cat and a dog
That's cool and all, but how great are those chairs
Adorable!
Was this taken with a selfie camera on?
The longer you watch it, the bigger it’s ears get.
What a freakin cutie
Clean up your shit Todd
earboye
r/petthedamndog
How are you filming this? Are you sitting there or some other way.
The ears!
Those EYES!!😳. He loves so beautiful 😍
Aw from fox and the hound!
Those are some beautiful eyes
beautiful cat
Boy his nose is working overtime!
he's so beautiful
I literally knew a guy named Todd Fox... no joke he worked for the UN
Todd looks so intelligent I almost expected him to start speaking.
Where’s Copper??
“You’re my best friend, Copper.”
omg so cute i want oneeee
Gorgeous!
Todd :,(
Why does the fox look so animated
Do you have a Copper waiting for him too? Ps that film can still reliably make me blubber like a baby
Why did you name him Todd?
Well you need to have a hound dog around obviously.
I just love how you name him Todd, what a good movie
I’ve always wondered if they make good sex partners
Showing off wealth right here. So blatant!
Hi Todd!
I love his black stockings! Such fashion
Did you know him Todd after the fox from fox and the hound??? That’s so cute
Fuckin’ *Todd*, man!
I love that his name is Todd but it makes me nostalgicly sad because I remember when he was dropped off in the woods in the movie....
"A fox is cat firmware running on dog hardware."
this would be one of the most amazing experiences of my life. i'd be so worried for the little guy if he stopped living in my garden tho! i used to leave cat food out for the hedgehogs around my house and also in the hopes that a fox might start visiting but never managed to attract one. lots of very fat hedgies tho!
How much did he get as royalties from Wes Anderson?




Get it? 




He's the Fantastic Mr. Fox .
His sense of smell is so sharp that he only needs to sniff oh so delicately!
I love him with all of my heart
Handsome animal and sooo curious🦊
I swear to god foxes don't look real.
Todd is a pretty cool guy.
HIS NAME IS TODD 😭
Why is there no sound?? What did he say!?!?!?
Swiper No Swiping! Swiper No Swiping! Swiper... too late. 

OP, so many questions I have but seen you already answered most so I’ll just ask one. How the hell did you get him to trust you to come so close? I have one around my neighborhood but he doesn’t come that close to the house.
beauty
where we live people are generally worried about foxes spreading diseases (esp. to dogs and cats i think). but i see lits of foxes in yard vids on reddit. is that more a local thing here?
He has the voice of George Clooney I assume?
Beautiful!
The fox who wore sox
Why does this look fake like AR ? Lightning and shadow are of
Todd!  Come back!  You have pretty eyes! Leave the kitties alone though.
I'm a hound dog!
Foxes are the cutest. It’s like a cat and a dog had a kid that looks like a dog but acts like a cat with a smidge of ferret mixed in somewhere.
Todd Black Socks!
Todd is beautiful. I hope you planted some fruit for him
Thank you naming him Todd.
u/savevideo
Do you drive... a Hearse??
Todd after Fox & Hound or Plague Dogs?
So lanky!!
Omggg how adorable!! Tfs! Have never seen any this close! So cute!
I LOVE THOSE EARS!!!!!
Nice
He looks like he needs some fat. I would give him my meat trimmings.
Todd like Fox and the Hound?? Super cute 🥰
Wow he’s so beautiful
Such a gorgeous fox!! I hope he comes back this summer!
That’s a nice looking fox
He is so gorgeous, I could just stare at this guy all day! 😍
Todd looks like he can jump about 9' high. 

Source: my dog built just like that who can jump about 8' high.
We’ll be friends forever!
HYAHHH
Me too. Hope you’re safe Todd ❤️
Is there a copper around?
I hope he doesn't come back with the forbidden milkshake
Naming the fox Todd...I see what you did there.
Todd is handsome!
I would just roll over and die❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Having a fox would scare off nuisance animals like rabbits and others that might wreck a garden, or am I mistaken?
Hi Todd!
Is he named after Todd from Fox and the Hound?
Hello Humans 

from todd
My sister has a fox that lives in her backyard, he has an agreement with her dog. They completely ignore each other
Hi Todd! What a cutie!
Tod is a Scots word for a fox. TYL.
Well, what did the fox say?
Cool camera!
Did you check it’s genitals or how do you know it’s a male?
I hope so, too. We need more photos of Todd. <3
Beautiful animal!!!
is that Foxy the fox?
Well you didn't have a rodent problem
Oh my goddddd it’s to cuteeee
Please post more pictures of your truck
What did he say? The fox.
I saw a fox run by me while I was on a walk.  It had my neighbor's cat in its mouth...dead, of course.

I had to tell my neighbor what happened.
My grandmother has a momma silver fox that uses her crawlspace every year when it’s kit season. So hopefully Todd will come back for a visit.
Every time I try and hit the like button Todd shys away.
Tod’s got a lil snout made for snooping
What an adorable cat-dog
What a beautiful creature
He is absolutely beautiful! Was he friendly at all?
Get some hens, I’m sure he’ll come back then.
Cutie
Ohhh man I'm so jealous!! I want one in my back yard! I hope he comes back to you.
With grandbabies too
Todd is cool af!
Todd is gorgeous. What a lovely visitor to have.
That's a beautiful fox 🦊! Is it still a juvenile ?
Too adorable 🥰. And I love his over the kneee socks 😅
Weird looking dog
Feed him and he will.
Todd is quite the handsome boy!
So 😊
I love that you have a Todd friendly garden.
Toe beans, please
If you see him shine a laser pointer on the ground,see what he does.
It has nice boots!
Very beautiful like an animated character!
Beautiful
I had a white fox live near my pond at my cabin in the mountains for 5 winters in a row

But what did he say?

Hi todd
ohmuhgerd EARS!
That thing is way too cool to be a Todd.
How did you know his name was Todd!
Is this a red fox? He looks different somehow
Foxes are the best! Love the name 😁
I think he might died 😂
He’s absolutely beautiful!
He looks like a well made CGI
Gorgeous!
Todd will come back this summer with his brother Rod
Aww
Just need a hound named copper
Damn! That is a skinny fox
He’s beautiful
For a bit there I thought he was a Maned Wolf, by how leggy he is.
Looks like a fox in socks
Awwwww! 🥺
I love Todd
Are you a funeral director for vets by any chance?
All you need now is a hound named Copper
What’s the deal with the car??
Todd 😭😭😭😭😭
If you listen closely you can hear "Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow! Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow! Wa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pow!"
He's so beautiful and leggy
hes cute & there's a person named Todd that I know spell't the same to
He so looks like a *cat~dog* ,,you can see both of them in him.. 🐈 🐕
 (Todd is the perfect name for him)
That  video looks unreal. The colors of the fox with the two chair colors behind it... beautiful!
What does the Fox say?
Wow he looks like a todd
r/crispgifs
Great clear video..is it a GoPro…it almost looks 3D
So... what does the fox say?!?!
Those black sock's!
Todd like from the Fox and the Hound.

😭😭
Seriously cool truck/camper thingie in the back there.
I assume he's named Todd like the one from Fox and the Hound?
Foxes in Canada are in much better condition than the foxies we have in London!
Todd
100% a todd lol
He looks and acts a lot like my min pin lol. Very cute
Look how leggy todd is!!!
Todd! The Fox and the hound!(snif) I’m not crying, you’re crying!!!
“You’re my best friend too, Todd. And we’ll always be friends forever.”
I wish there were sound. I'd love to know what did the fox say.
What did he say?
He's like "Soo, when are you getting some chickens?"
Why do all foxes I see on Reddit look all cute and cuddly, yet the ones in my area look like they're on crack?
Audio? Audio? Does he make cute noises? Please I must knoe
He’s a handsome little one.
He looks like a Maned Wolf!
r/adorablecreature
I love Tod. I can't to let him. Can I?
So pretty! How do you know his name is Todd?
I had a den near my house that would produce a litter every year. Sadly a couple would be hit by cars before they moved off to other digs. I think the mother came there to have her litter to keep them safe from coyotes until they were a little bigger.
Did you name him todd after the fox and the hound?
He told you his name is Todd? Walter lied to you!
I ❤️todd
Dangit. I want a Todd in my garden. Jelly.
Mr. Eat yo cat
I think your Todd may actually be a Vixie.
It looks too much with the Lobo Guara we have in Brazil
That make so many different sounds I started to regret not taking that 2010s song seriously
I know who would not return, that rabbit family .
Hi precious Todd! 🦊
He’s so beautiful !
Gorgeous baby!
Tell him he's beautiful when you see him again pls :)
	
Looking for a good reddit crypto shiller. Most be a proper master hehehe nice karma, subreddits e.t.c DM please..
Awesome, Todd. Now I know where you wander at night.
i love him.
I'm guessing it's no coincidence that [the name Todd means "fox"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_(given_name))
Todd is beautiful
todd
That is one foxy fox. Beautiful colours
Last summer a Todd looking fellow killed half my chickens and a quarter of my ducks, I’ve been known to shake my fist in the general directions of Todda
Port baby looks scared at first
Very Cool!!
Nice boy.
Yes my parents have a pair of foxes that come out in the day and at night. At night you will see them playing in the back yard it's awesome.
Definitely a todd
He looks like a Todd
I probably wouldn't try to interact with one but foxes are so cute.
That's one way to keep rabbits from eating your vegetables.
Fantastic.
I love Todd
That is incredible! So very cool
I love Todd
Get some chickens.  He'll be back.
Gawd he’s beautiful
Draw me a sheep
Todd looks like he would do the 'whats up' the the face tilted up and smiling and winking. The face hello basically.
Cool boots Todd!
I love todd. I want to snuggle on the couch with Todd and watch a movie.
What does the fox say?
He’s looking for the priest
Spent entire video waiting for Todd to bolt at any given second. Wasn't meant to be. He's a curious fellow for sure.
I would die for todd
Good name for a fox 🦊
Their so damn cute and curious. They're like kittys crossed with a dog lol
Op I think that was not a fox but a crysocion (I'm not sure if I spelt it correctly). I'm saying this because they have longer legs than foxes
I moved my finger at the perfect time by accident... as I moved, Todd flinched... and I had to question whether he could see me or not...
Todd is curious as a fox. ♥️
I don't want to be a Debbie downer but I think foxes live only like 5 years in the wild, him returning depends on lots of factors, they're wild animals after all.
We have foxes around our neighborhood. Right now there are quite a few who just had babies.
Todd is stylin' with them black socks.
Aww! Foxes are so cool!
"Anyone gotz any tweets for me?"
Will he try to sell me skyrim for the 87th time?
Those ears are crazy
If you follow him, you may find an Inari shrine!
Aww.  At first I thought Coyote/prairy dog? (Because Reddit is so much US and the truck in the back). But it’s a Fox! No wonder there is this saying : “She’s a fox!”   I saw one in the Netherlands when I was a kid. That one was very orange and brighter white.  I had not thought about nor seen one since a long time.  So very Aww.  Born to be free. Never a pet (I hope, for both owner and fox sake).   Hahaha.  For fox sake.  :D
Those ears 😍
Didja know that a bay fox is a tod?
Todd has probably moved onto someone who is better in tune with what he wants- food.

Super cute little guy, and almost worryingly friendly.
Tod got style! Look at him working those black boots 😍
Such a beautiful animal... and your garden ain't too shabby either!
Foxes are awesome, they are like little cat dogs😃
Long teen!
Beautiful! You should set up a wildlife camera. It’s so interesting watching them
Fox and the hound?
Look at that leggy boi!! So cute!
r/fox
Aww you named him Todd (:
Is it Mr. Todd?, As in Beatrix Potter's Mr. Todd
I had baby foxes frolicking in my back yard.
You are very lucky. I hope he comes back to visit.
Todd is absolutely stunning!
With the crazy weather he probably not sure what time of year it is.
A Fox and the Hound nod, I love it <3
Love Todd!!
Todd is great.
Am I the only one who watched this and said,"Hey Todd"?
Todd's a cutey...
Interesting we have one cute little fox being welcomed into a backyard while the Jehovah’s Witnesses are being downvoted into oblivion on the post above...hoping for a more United world, love both these creatures
He left cause you named him Todd
Come home Todd
That is so freaking awesome!
Follow him to his shrine and make an offering!  You might get a cool charm out of it.
Looks more like a Maned Wolf than a fox somehow, lol.
“Todd”. Excellent.
Now imagine this in Full-screen with 3D..
I don’t know why you named him “Todd” - maybe Todd Fox the fighter - but I understand that the name may actually mean “fox” - so could be slightly tautological 

I used to work with a guy whose middle name was “Todkill” or “Toddkill” - he said it was an old family surname from Yorkshire and that tod(d) meant “fox” in old English \ Norse or summat and that one of his ancestors was the village fox exterminator.
r/feedthedamnfox
Oh, I am so jealous!
Is that an IDI in the background?
he long
Pretty creature.
Can you pat foxes or are they too dangerous?
You gotta get yourself a Hound dog.
"Todd" may have rabies.
I can’t look at foxes the same after seeing a litter of pups cannibalize themselves due to starvation.
Is it just me or does this fox really look like a Todd? It's got Todd vibes
What did he say?
Todd is very handsome
I have a hound you could borrow to be his friend.
"cute" is an understatement about todd he's more than cute
UGHHHH WHY IS SO PRETTYYYYY
omg he’s so adorable
u/savevideo
Love fox videos? Check out Wildlife Aid on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/GRIE_juEcQo).
Omg he’s so cute and beautiful. What a treat to have a fox visitor 😍
I prefer this to the sight of my neighbors chickens... lol
Todd... Why would you do this!  
[I can hear the song now...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAzYyVcB4t8)
Todd as in coppers best friend please tell me you have a bloodhound named copper
I think they drop emeralds try that
Good foxxo
Come back Todd!
Ok so for some reason Todd is giving me a “If I were human id have a thin blond mustache” energy...
I love Todd.
I LOVE YOU TODD
apparently they are BIG fans of blueberries, and its ok to give them some as treats
Just start raising chickens.   He’ll be back.
Just make sure copper doesn’t find the poor guy.
What a sweet fella!
I love that you call him Todd.
Love the name. Todd. 
Did you get that from the Fox and the Hound?
How gorgeous is Todd.  Such animation in his movements.  I half expected him to start talking.  I hope he comes back 💟
Give us an update!!
Did he eat your shit?
OMG! This is so cool!
Such a beautiful visitor
Great name. He's a total Todd.
I didn’t read the title before watching but I named him Marvin
Is that a funeral car?
They are a beautiful creature.  Is it as close to you as it appears, or do you have a wildlife camera set up?
