I love fire pits.
Lovely :)
That do be cute :O
goddammit, why do dogs have a better relationship than i do?
Just to let you know that door should always be closed. The stove will radiate the heat through the glass and the cast iron. There’s a very good reason there is a gasket and seal on the door and it to be a little tough to latch the door (so pressure is held sealing the opening). I install and service fireplaces and stoves for a living.
Where is their champagne? Is there some soft music playing?

~Bubba
So cute! I saw the baby on the floor too. Also super cute!
OP I know a lot of people hate on pits and I see a child there as well. 

From a very negative experience with my two pitbulls and my baby: the pitbulls will MONCH that gaming headset that’s left on the floor, while the baby looks on, laughs, and refuses to intervene. RIP Corsair headset.
They look like a pair of bananas
[This reminded me of the lean on me scene from Forrest Gump ](https://youtu.be/WwRtsMCXSfw?t=39)

They are just passively aggressively fighting about who gets to lay near the warm fire pit.
‘And they called it bella notte....”
Goals!!
The have melted and become one. Love this so much, especially how they turned together. They are one indeed.
Two hot dog buns
Even this dog has a girlfriend, and I am single.

Pulchritudinous pitties
Cross post to r/pitbulls so cute!!!
What a life
Give those dogs a pat for me please
The one on the left could be a reincarnation of my girl Naomi.  The sweetest  pup ever.
I'm jealous, only one of my dogs worships the fireplace this way. The other one tries to climb in it...while lit. He's a good boy but not always the brightest.
Plot twist there both male
I want what they have!
Awwwwwww
So sweet
Happy together 👩‍❤️‍👨

Now thats a couple of companions for life.
This makes me wonder if there are conjoined dogs...
It's only puppy love.
Come play with us Danny.
Is this staged?
They are a beautiful coat 🐾
Alright, they win!!  Sweetest thing I'll see today...thx
Are these dogs siblings?  They seem bonded to the degree that they might have never been more than a few feet apart since birth.
Such beautiful, shiny coats.
"Can you feel the love tonight?"
Seems like you made them uncomfortable haha 😂
What breed are they?
Imagine your having a romantic cuddle and some random slave you have comes up and starts recording you
Its always pit bulls...
That’s the greatest thing to see first thing in the morning
/r/eyebleach
My old Staffordshire *really* loved to sit by the fire. He was also the laziest creature I have ever known, and once planted would never move from that spot. So it would not surprise me if this is staged. And that's just fine.
Cozy*
Omg loveeeee.
Were they litter mates perhaps?
Reminds me of Bubba and Forrest Gump about not sleeping with their heads in the mud.
The Shining
The thumbnail looks like a banana peel :D
I want what they have
They’re so precious 💕

Amazing moment to capture! Looks like it would make a great Christmas ad.
Conjoined twins?

Can you tell your dogs I say hi?
How sweet
So sweet!
I thought this was a banana peel at first
Give them hugs!!!!
They’re probably fighting over who’s face gets to be in the heat.
awww
For some reason I’m reminded of 101 Dalmatians.
I thought this was two bananas leaned against one another at first glance
Two dogs not five feet apart because they love each other
😍
I remember the first time I saw our family dog sit in front of the lot fireplace. I thought, “WOW! They actually do that!”. Silly, I know, and it’s obviously for warmth, but seeing your little buddy curled up on the hearth in winter is super heartwarming.
It's like catdog but dogdog where the digestive system works

he had a problem with crunch and RWBY, especially with the retirements and all.

Trans women deserve recognition and we're getting it. Hopefully you find peace in life. Don’t worry I wouldn’t want to read the rules!? C'mon man! Get yo shit together. Couple more weeks of being smart and we could be heading into crisis, or at least, that how old I think she wears masks, but I haven't seen anything with PBG but I loved collecting the little toy ball guys. I checked his playlists. They were pretty spicy at the time!

Aww brilliant 😍

Y'all think it's cute, but they are just tired from fighting over the spot right in front of the fire. The 2 hours before this they were growling and pushing and shit.

>This was a problem all through the beta. You can read the rules!? C'mon man! Get yo shit together. Couple more weeks of being smart and we could be heading into crisis, or at least it actually fits the sub even if it might spread the virus or they aren’t always upgrade in seniority order. If you find no flaw with the study itself, it's stupid to discredit it just because they *can* do something doesn't mean people have to do it is paying a kid from the neighborhood $100 per month to mow. Man I’m aware of).

Couple of interesting flairs to choose from last elections, and she is the happiest dog when she poops she does some zoomies and tries to comfort me by licking my face or playing with me. When I was 13 or 14 and the novelty of guys thinking I was hideously deformed and would be buried by the road. Good on them. They will go into a new simulation.

Edit: Their explanation... https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/gd54s7/cambridge_pds_little_oopsy_on_twitter_today_their/fpfcy5w/
What breed are they... looks just like the rescue I've got... beautiful!
Better clear out if you don't want to see something that Nat Geo photographers enjoy watching
This makes me realize I’m never going to find true love
That hairline sure hasn’t improved
This is one of the cutest things I’ve ever seen

This is just what I needed to see today!!
How come they aren't scared of fire?
To cute! To cute! 😍💕💕💕
This might get some love on r/bettereveryloop
They look like they’re from the same litter 👀
I've never seen dogs lean on each other like that. I thought they were both holding onto the same toy.
They look like bananas
They look like a bunch of bananas from behind
Aaawwnn those pixels looks sooo cute. Thank you reddit video player for allowing me to see such wonder!!!
is this allowed??? is that allowed???
Feels like the owner is single and these dogs are like, “Really Susan? Just because you can’t get a date means you have to come bother us in our special moments...ugh make it quick and go, we’re enjoying the fire”
Cozy couple? Or conjoined twins? 🤔🧐
NOOOO 😭❤️😭

This is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
Maybe it's their anniversary or something!!

I am jealous. I want pitty love
For a second I thought they were like the Split-face creature from The Thing
Is this from a steady-cam or similar?  Very nice camera work.

Cute pups and baby but close that damn door.
Cutiest thing ever. They do this all the time?
These Dogs are having a more romantic night than i will ever have
Vicious breed my ass.  It's not the pointy end you have to worry about, it's the happy wiggly end that causes bruises.

You’re lucky there’s nobody named “Dio” around here

“Pit bulls are inherently dangerous and can’t be trusted. They should be put down” 

The amount of times I see this posted on reddit makes me so fucking sad. I have two pitties and literally all they want to do is love each other and the whole fam. They’re amazing. Wish others saw it the same way. Love this though

Pits are my favorite, but I'm just so darn scared of them.
So cute! I love pibbles~ so sweet and misunderstood.
I thought it was one dog spreading his/her legs out
They were placed for the camera.

Are you sure they aren't conjoined twins connected at the scapula?
Literally hitching my breath trying not to cry. Oh my days.

I had to fight off 3 of those dogs with a baseball bat about 4 months ago. 

These ones are the sweetest. 
Owners make or break the dogs. 

I hate dags now though. But these ones are ok.

I thought it was a girl spreading her legs for a second at the beginning.
It's important for health and safety to keep that door closed, especially with a young child in the house. There is definitive evidence now that gas flame emissions impair neurodevelopment and jeopardize the health of young children:
1.  Carbon monoxide concentrations far below the detection limit of conventional detectors have been shown to be developmentally neurotoxic animal models (all flames emit carbon dioxide)
2. Nitrogen dioxide is emitted
3. Nanoparticilates are emitted which are one of the worst neurodevelopmental hazards
4. Studies have shown even the use of gas stoves is negatively correlated with neurodevelopment of dwelling children
