This wasn't the first time this has happened with this cat, either!
Why are orange puffy cats always so friendly
They're buddies
Update: My cat doesn't interact with wildlife at all anymore. He is regularly checked by the vet for a variety of illnesses (including ticks)! I appreciate everyone's concern but, rest assured, my cat is healthy and safe!
I always was under the impression deers were scared of everything
I think I'm supposed to focus on the deer but that cat's tail is glorious!
Oh sure, but when I do it, people are like, "Stop licking my cat, get out of my backyard, and put your pants back on." Stupid double-standards.
Your cat has been chosen by a forest spirit
That's a big ass cat you got there.

Quick question, how often do you eat salted chips/snacks, and then pet your cat?
You cat is a Disney princess.
my dog 4 hours after i made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
If this ain‚Äôt some Disney type shit, I don‚Äôt know what is.
Isn‚Äôt it dangerous for your cat? Deer have ticks
God there‚Äôs not much sweeter than two animals bonding together, especially when they‚Äôre so different. They set such a good example for humans to love those different from them, not in spite of their differences but because of them. What a beautiful moment, I‚Äôm so glad you were able to capture it and share it! Such a treasure (the moment/video and the animals themselves)!
Can someone qualified (a vet perhaps?) explain why a wild deer would do this? Genuinely curious. It appears the deer is exhibiting affection but also a cat does not resemble a baby deer or any form of deer whatsoever. So can deers in general just have enough consciousness to think ‚Äúhmm a cute creature that is not related to my species, I think I‚Äôll lick it to show adulation and affection‚Äù?  That implies some degree of the deer thinking above and beyond it‚Äôs animal instinct of self preservation, and also that creatures recognize cuteness in other creatures even if they aren‚Äôt their own species - that seriously can‚Äôt be what‚Äôs going on surely?
What in the Disney princess is going on in your neighborhood!?!?
Your cat is clearly a Disney princess that has been placed under a spell. The Deer prince will be released from his spell once the cat has been licked 100 times. Then they will marry and live happily ever after.
Your cat may be a Disney Princess.
Your cat‚Äôs tail is lit asf
He do be lickin him doe üò≥üò≥üò±üò±
Hey OP, is your cat vaccinated? As a cat owner the first thing that goes through my mind is rabies is transmitted through saliva and the deer is licking your cat's face. I don't think rabies super common in deer, just wanted to pass this info along in good faith. Maybe something to look out for in the future.
This sounds like a code spies use. 

"The deer is licking my cat" 

"I see, the dog has travelled upwards towards the mountain. Here's your sensitive information Hunt. Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is..." 

Apart from that, this is really cute.
That's quite a floof you've got there
It's very cute, but I would be cautious because deer have been known to become carnivorous at times.
The kitty probably gave the deer toxoplasmosis and that‚Äôs why the deer is in love, I remember an article somewhere that was talking about the effects of toxoplasmosis on people and it was saying that it makes humans more tolerant of kitties. Could all be bullshit but who knows. Cats control us not the other way around.
Your cat is a Disney princess and you must treat her as such.
Cats are the saltiest animals most of the time..knocking crap off tables, constant starving screams..a walking salt lick
Make sure your cat has flea and tick protection. They get all those gross tick diseases, too.
What a majestic flooof. I understand why the deer just had to lick the flooofiness
The cat is being blessed !!
This is so fjsgejdusbrbsjbsn cute :3
Do you have a particularly salty cat?
Woke up this mornin‚Äô - my cat‚Äôs licked by a deeeuuh!

Shitty the Doors joke.
Cute
Animals are so weird 
Why would a deer lick a house cat?!? Like they have any nutritional value whatsoever!! So fucking strange
Is your cat...salty?
Wtf that's a giant cat!
The deer could sense that your cat's attitude was Salty AF.
That title feels like a missed opportunity
It's like they've known each other for a long time.
check your cat for ticks. deer are usually loaded with them.
all these people going on about ticks...that's why you're supposed to regularly treat your cats for fleas and ticks? people can bring in ticks too. mice are everywhere and carry them often, too. if you live in or near the woods, the deer isn't necessary to bring them to you lol
Dunno if this was already mentioned but they do that when they have parasites. It's the parasites way to be passed onto the next animal
r/brandnewsentence
This is the start of a beautiful Disney movie.
I have a cat that lays out on our lawn in the mornings with the deer sometimes, it‚Äôs awesome!
Watch out that your cat does not get ticks
Is it like a car wash for cats?
Orange is a good flavor of cat.
So very precious
How small is that deer? How big is that cat
The love that dare not speak its name...

(...cause we don't know what to call it.)
Cute! Now check for ticks...
Everyone knows that cats are naturally salty.
Not pet-shaming you or anything but maybe try to prevent interaction with wild animals. Deer ticks are deadly and while this specific deer is nice the next one could be a protective mama or hormonal buck. Hope you and your creamsicle kitty stay safe.
Look at my cat, my cat is amazing.  
Give it a lick! (\[Mmm! It tastes just like raisins.\])
Check your baby for ticks! Deer are covered in them.
Bet that was a sentence you never thought you'd say
This is super cute but please be careful about ticks.
Looks cool deers are quite friendly but check your cat for ticks also, very easy caught when near deer. Can be easily removed if found early but cause serious damage if not.
This is how your cat and your family gets Lyme Disease when you don't understand how it happened.
your cat is a deer now
Hey just so you know CWD - chronic wasting disease is a prion disease that is carried by deer in some parts of NA. CWD is not like other pathogen in that it is actually a misfolded protein that sets off a cascade of other proteins to misfold in the brain. The scary part is that the disease can jump the species barrier very easily because it works via a different mechanism
CHECK YOUR CAT AND YOURSELF FOR TICKS. Deer are the main carrier of ticks, and the diseases they can carry are no joke
My cats would go for his throat
Oh dear gorgeous
This some Disney shit...
This is how cwd spreads to humans
This would make me laugh out loud, literally. Your cat must be charming.

I‚Äôve never been a cat owner and I was wondering if Lyme disease is a concern? That was my first reaction but I‚Äôve only owned dogs, one of which caught Lyme.
I caught my cat touching noses with deer two times.
Your cat is a Disney princess
Fire and brimstone coming down from the skies ‚Ä¶ Rivers and seas boiling‚Ä¶ Dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!

I can safely say this is a combination of words I never expected to read in my life...
The world is full of amazing wonders you just have to look closer and with an open mind
The deer is incredibly cute. So is the cat too !
Wow Pure love imagine guys a life without those sweet animals !!
Go back inside and come out again - can‚Äôt wait for the next instalment!

Omg, your cat is so fluffy!
That's a sentence I've never heard before, thank you.
This is totally adorable! What an honor! <3
"Our love is nothing to be ashamed of, Ginger... let them film us, I am not afraid."
Wow man. Isn't this a sight to behold!
Oh deer
Your cat is a Disney princess
I love you deer.

I love you too, kitten.
The final sign of the apocalypse!  To your bunkers, people!  The end is nigh!
Just love how the cat is like "alright, this is happening" *shrug*
Adorable!!!
Your cat is the superior hunter.
Awwww, they look like old friends.
The cat is a messenger of the forest
Anytime someone posts their animal on reddit, "uh do you know how to take care of that animal?" 

Never fails.
love it
As one does.
Your cat is a Disney princess.
My cat's breath smells like cat food
Damn, nature, you adorable
Hopefully that deer doesn‚Äôt have CWD. Acting a bit strange
Now this is epic
I love your cat‚Äôs tail!
What a majestic animal ! 
The deer is cute too.
My name is doe,

I'm not the foe,

Would you believe:

Cat tastes like leaf.


Someone who speaks English should write a better one though.
a deer whisperer, he doesn‚Äôt seem to be enjoying the affection.
Imagine walking outside to find a cat licking your deer. Now that would be insane.
Deers are so magical.
You‚Äôve been blessed.
How majestic
Besties
Omg too cute
There will be fleas.
Flame point rag doll, great cat
Is your cat a salty bastard?
Cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all day
Aww they're pals! 

I had a huge floofy cat that got out of my apartment one day. I looked over my balcony (lived on the 2nd story) and my cat was lounging in the grass with a couple of bunnies! The bunnies were sniffing him but he was being super chill and just letting them. Best cat I ever had.
Wow you‚Äôre lucky too see that live! Thanks to share the video
so cute
Nature is healing.
Just make sure to check for ticks!
I'd write off that day as a win
Totes adorbs
I know this is cute and all but.... That's the most random and rare think that could happen to you
That is so cute I almost cried..
I swear one day we are going to find a genetic marker that overrides animals instincts and promotes bonding. There has to be some reasonable explanation for that one tiger out of 200 that will save the baby deer instead of eating it, for the tortoise that adopts a hippo, for the wolf that decided humans were better companions than their own pack.
Cause she's as sweet as pie!
That‚Äôs some mystical shit right there mr meow meow.
Real Friends come in all races and species
It‚Äôs his servant, recently hired. Nothing to see here, carry on.
Must be a salty cat
So, your cats a Disney princess?
Apparently your cat is a disney princess.
Very cute!  Aside from the ticks most deer carry, that is...
Bambi just wanted some love.
Nature is awesome
They're magical 0: and I love them with all my heart!
That is a floofy thicc boi
Awww so precious
Love is love
Cats like "What? I don't judge the weird shit you do.."
Im not a cat person usually but the fluff is making me rethink my life choices lmao
ü•∞ aww
did you apologize for interrupting their special  time?
This is how Herbivores slowly evolve into Carnivores. In 100,000 years we'll see herds of omnivore/carnivore deer.
Is your cat named Salty?
Deer cat, can i lick you?
i have no hand

in which to pat

withe ma tongue

i licke de cat
Really missed the opportunity to use a different word..
I hate to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù but this might not be as innocent as it looks.

Sometimes when deer have nutritional deficiencies they are known to lick *or eat* other animals.

Usually these are dead things, but they have been observed eating live rodents, possums, baby chicks, and even adult ducks and chickens.  They pin them under a hoof and start chowing down.

Cows, horses, and other herbivores have been observed, and even filmed, doing the same.
Man cats are such whores. They'll skank up to anyone for some scritches.
Oh deer.. Stop it, people's watching!!
Cat: but we can never be together, they‚Äôll never understand 

Deer: shh we‚Äôll make it work
Surprising that the deer didn't bolt on seeing you. Is it a pet, too?
Clearly your cat is running around with friends you know nothing about.... looks like a pretty wild bunch tooüòÇ
Adeerable
Purfectly deer to our hearts
Check the cat for ticks
"here have some lyme's disease."
I would be afraid of deer ticks
Lol!!üòçüòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Please check your cat for ticks- having it on a flea and tick preventative might be a good idea. Deer ticks can carry some nasty, sometimes devastating diseases.  Then check your human family.
What a sweet video though!
Please check your cat for ticks. Big love.
People saying 'this isn't normal. It has this or that." You might wanna look at the deer and see it's a first yr... It hasn't learned to be afraid of everything yet. Plus it lives in a suburban area so a lot of the 'normal' fears aren't there for him.
Seems legit
So do I deer boy! So do I.
What kind of ice cream is that deer licking?
Is this some kind of erotic metaphor?
Your cat is a Disney princess.
Maximal cuteness score!
Don't judge their love.
To anyone reading this don‚Äôt let your pet near a deer. Not only might they get a tick or something, there‚Äôs also the chance that they might get stomped out by those hooves.
How often has this deer shown up? One of the early symptoms of rabies in wild animals is being unafraid of getting near humans (even getting cuddly, in some cases I've heard), so it might be worth watching if it displays any other symptoms! 

I'm hoping it's just cute! I'm just a worrywart.
Pls check your cat for ticks. Those suckers will even get on you if your not careful.
Awe that deer's full of keesses!
That far dog is pretty big
Check for ticks...
awww...lime disease.  adorable.
Deer probably thought 'weird look baby but I'll look after it'. The cat probably thought 'Mum? That you?'.
Guess who's coming for dinner?
The tail is adorable and soo floofy
 I only call you when it's half past five  
The only time that I'll be by your side  
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me

refreshing catscream on a sunny day
OMG, How CUTE!!!  
Where do you live?  Not a town or anything, just a state.  I know that deer in a lot of places are becoming very used to humans.
What a coincidence? I just saw a deer walking very nonchalant in front of my lawn yesterday evening.  Lol
So, as it turns out, your little flower bed with the lemongrass and yukka plants is like a highway rest area at 3 am, only for animals. Random anonymous licking NSA.
Oh god
That deer is a paid actor.
Your cat looks so much like mine I can't help but wonder if they're related.
Some cats do anything for attention
I‚Äôd walk outta my house for that too
Does the cat distract the deer from eating the landscaping?
such a nice video)
What kinda deer is that
it was just leik awkward to have hooman watching
What a strange scenario...
Our cats are twins omg
All life matters. Even animals understands that
I wish we had stuff like deers running around here. The cat seems to have a good time.
The other deer looking on: ‚ÄúDammit, Bambi‚Äôs at it again. Always with the other animals being weird‚Äù
Small one is leader!
The cat whisperer

What's your cat's name? Salty?

Your cat must be salty...
Because it was focused on the car at first, I thought the title meant to say car, and was a typo.
And when he broke the 7th seal, the deer began licking cats.
It's those salty tear boogers. Loved deerly.
Eating a plant you mean. There's no cat there.
Animal Crossing IRL.
..oh great, another deer licking a cat video!  /s

Wow where in the world was this?
I wss not expecting the deer to be THAT close
The Dear loved your cat, they love Carrots, once when I was in Canada I've seen one, I was scared because I never actually seen animals like I usually do, I was trying to approach it, but I couldn‚Äôt, because she was always thinking I would hurt her, bu after so many tries, she approached me as my grandpa was making the deer approach slowly, I was like (Omg how was he doing this? Then she just stole the carrot ;-;
Was that deer licking your cat‚Äôs eye goobers? Lol
r/unexpected
I saw a deer making out with a French Bulldog in another post. Something strange is happening. End of days. "Dogs and cats living together" You've  been warned.
excuse me wtf?
Wow
Wholesome.
The deer must've misheard/misunderstood something! üòÇ
"Toxoplasmosis is known to occur in **white-tailed deer, mule deer,** elk, moose, pronghorn antelope, bison, bobcats, caribou, black bears, polar bears, mink, red foxes, raccoons, skunks, and many bird and rodent species. Marine mammals such as sea lions, seals, sea otters, and dolphins are also susceptible."
my cat just stalks the deer like she isn‚Äôt a sixth of their size
Surprised the deer is so calm with you near. The deer in my neighborhood always bolt at the first sign of a human.
That is one Majestic cat!
They're friends!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Don't kink shame him.
Cat doesn't seem pleased. Why are cat so hard to please ?
Stop putting salt on your cat
Fluffy tail
Deer would run away from a bigger cat. Maybe he's jokin on a mini-lion
Is this in gig harbor? Is that Beauregard?!
Do you ever upvote a post before the video even plays?
i didnt read it right the first time. i didnt read licking right the first time. help.
You are going to need a bigger deer.

Just how big is this cat??
"This is one salty cat."
Very pretty ‚ò∫üòÄ

Deer seem to love cats. They were always interested in mine and would try to walk up to her. But the cat would have none of it and nope the fuck out when they‚Äôd start walking towards her.

Oh sure, they act all friendly, but then you catch them pooping all over your living room carpet.

The hell with cats!

Of all the flavors in the world, thank you for being salty.

Now you wait at you house and when your cat come back you smel and hiss at him

Dunno why but when I scrolled through by at first, I read that as ‚Äúlicking my car‚Äù. Cat is much cuter a scenario though!

One word: Ticks.
Aren't these deers full of diseases? Is this safe for the cat?
Oh dear!
Right meow the cheapest meat on a deer are the testicles.  They're under a buck.
make sure that cat doesn't get any ticks !!!
Nothing wrong with licking some p*ssy.
Deer will eat meat if they get the chance so maybe be careful if there's a big one around. I've seen them eat injured birds and rabbits, a cats not that much bigger.

 So, lick it now, lick it good  
Lick this p-ssy just like you should

Where in the comments does some tell us how they're both dying?
Awe,  That's so sweet.  Just goes to show you that deer can be affectionate.  I wish deer hunting would be made illegal.  So many deer are hunted down, here in Canada.
*Fact: Deers can be occasionally found eating meat.*
That deer is taste testing your cat
Why the fuck is your cat outside?
I can't believe this. I actively hunt for deer and couldn't dream of getting this close.
Sooo cute. Okay not to be that person, but make sure they are up-to-day with flea and tick treatments!
It's just making sure the ticks are evenly distributed

Oh dear, cats kinky
And a new virus emerges
Well how the turntables.....
This is so sweet, but I‚Äôm gonna be the annoying human hoping you treat or check your kitty for ticks when they come back in from adventures!
That isn't at all normal and you should probably chase that deer away. That deer  has toxoplasma gondii. This can be transferred via the deer urine to other animals like dogs. Chase that deer away if you ever see it again.
Why is your cat outside?
Outdoor cats are still bad.
I‚Äôd like to think the deer is a past Hooman to cat reincarnate.
Hey
Is your cat salty?
Are you salty bro?

Please be careful and always check your animals if they play with the deer.  I had a dog that played with the deer. She got a deer tick. üò•
Are you stupid? Deer don't behave that way. It probably had a fungal infection of the brain. One in my hometown did this to sym elderly man,  then suddenly turned aggressive and kicked the shit out of him 

Not to mention deer are covered in diseased ticks,  and are only good at destroying your plants and vehicles. STOP POSTING DEER TO R/AWW THEY ARE THE WORST ANIMAL GOD EVER CREATED.
Dear God nothing bad happened
Yeah but did it taste like chicken or fish?
He's getting his meal ready
Change it with a dog
This is the 3rd video I've seen of a deer licking someone's pet.
HOMG.

I can't see past the stabilization artifacts. Very cute, though.
