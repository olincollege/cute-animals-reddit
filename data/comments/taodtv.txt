*Dog is confused, but complacent.*
Good human. Hope they're both safe.
I’ve had to do that before on a hike when my dog got injured.  About half that distance, dog half that size and in the best shape of my life at the time.  I still complain about it today.  Respect to this person.
Gorgeous dog, awesome human.
This photo is a Ukrainian woman’s husband carrying Pulya, their 12 year old dog towards the Polish border. He got his family across the border and then had to return to Ukraine. The real story is even more heartbreaking than the way OP has presented it

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/ukraine-russia-crisis-border

Edit: I spelled Ukrainian wrong
Family is family.  Gotta do what u gotta do.
I carried a dog about that size a mile and a half once and thought I was going to die. 17km is pretty badass.
When you can’t run you walk, when you can’t walk you crawl, and when you can’t crawl you hope you know someone willing to carry you.
You'd be surprised how love and fear fuels you
This is beautiful. It's scary being an owner of so many animals. We have a herd of cattle and a lot of other livestock and we have an evacuation plan which involves turning a lot loose if we had to. Scary thought and one of my biggest fears. We are in Canada but, you never know what will happen in life,
It was her husband, and it wasn't the entire 17km (10 miles) -- from [the article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/ukraine-russia-crisis-border):

>My dog is 12 and a half and she struggled to walk and fell down every kilometre or so and couldn’t stand up again. I stopped cars and asked for help but everyone refused; they advised us to leave the dogs. But our dogs are part of our family. My dog has experienced all the happy and sad moments with us. Mum’s dog is all she has left of her former life. So my husband, at times, carried our dog on his shoulders.
They make them tough in Ukraine
This is the best motivation to be fit — to be strong enough to do this if it’s ever needed.
Yall ever tried carrying a dog this size even 100ft? They get heavy fast
He ain't heavy, he's my pupper
No soul left behind ❤️🇺🇦

Can you link where you found this? I'd like to read about this.

Dogs like have you ever heard of the fireman’s carry?
I would have done the same for my dog too. No question.
Sad 😢.. hope they’re ok.
A beautiful show of affection.
stay safe ❤️️
I’m looking at my four German shepherds, thinking there is no possible way I could carry even one of them. But damnit, I would try my hardest. The love of an animal, a best friend, a family member ❤️❤️
Damm, I’m crying.
read the whole article, its a big clickbait title. Still inspiring but not really what the title promises

"My dog is 12 and a half and she struggled to walk and fell down every kilometre or so and couldn’t stand up again. I stopped cars and asked for help but everyone refused; they advised us to leave the dogs. But our dogs are part of our family. My dog has experienced all the happy and sad moments with us. Mum’s dog is all she has left of her former life. So my husband, at times, carried our dog on his shoulders."
my dog is 16 years old and i would do this for him. i could never leave him behind. if i physically couldnt then i would stay with him. i just could never leave my dog behind especially after all we been through after 16 years.
This is the way ❤️

Also, if you are able to donate, here is a list of charities and organizations helping in Ukraine

And the dodo, also, listed several animal shelters

https://www.thedodo.com/daily-dodo/pets-in-ukraine-heartbreaking-photos-show-people-clinging-to-their-animals-as-they-flee

Just spreading the word is helping!
It's her husband carrying the dog and the dog walked most of the way it sounds like.

Careful on the feel good clickbait yall. I know this one's on the more harmless side, but there's been a lot of misinformation surrounding Ukraine.

This is why I dislike Reddit at times. So much misleading content. It’s actually the husband in the Pic and the wife taking the picture.
Omg, bless her for the love for her senior pet. The strength  and determination of this woman. I salute you and send good wishes from NYC
❤️
I can't even pick my dog up, let alone carry her.  Good thing I have a wheel barrow.
Bless this woman!!! who has a pure heart ♥️🐶
Please be safe both of you
That is dedication
There are many people who can’t walk half that far with no old dog on their shoulder. This is a boss
There is a statement; ‘we don’t deserve dogs’. But some people really do deserve dogs.
And my piece of shit country isnt taking in any. Fuck you Boris and fuck this racist ass country
I have a dog that size and he’s old and arthritic.  I would carry him too.  This picture hit me in the feels.
I have huge sympathy for what they are going through, but I also hate these BS heart string pulling images.

She didn't carry that big dog like that for 17km.  If it was healthy it would walk with her.  If it was ill, you'd rig up a sling or a backpack, or pull a child wagon..
More heartbreaking than aww 😢
Gotta move that gear Up!
To freedom!!!!!!!
This is the way. I wouldn’t hesitate to do this with my two.
I love this so much
Okay but honestly what kind of heartless person would leave their best friend behind?
Oh my heart. These poor people. Bless her.
I love the resilience this woman has. 
As an owner of a GSD, i tried to lift my dog up for several purposes and couldnt hold him up for more than 5 mins. 
And this lady here, has done an extraordinary feat! 
So much of respect! ♥️
Dog lovers of the world, unite!
Cooler then cool. My favorite trait in people is going the extra mile in pet ownership and she did it literally. SALUTE!
I would help her without a doubt. I would also carry my dog no matter what. She’ll never see this but, you are an example, thanks for not abandoning your dog. Hope the best for you both.
Good doggo
Ooof. My sweet Lexi (14 next April 19th!) is really starting to slow down. Tonight I had to carry her down the deck stairs so she could go potty, and I have a herniated L4/L5. It's really hard for me to see her aging so rapidly, just a few months ago she was sprinting around the yard having a great time. 

I would still carry her as far as my broken body will allow, she means the world to me. 

As a professional dog trainer, my goal isn't just to teach people how to train their dogs. It's to teach them how to create that lifelong bond with the animal. As painful as it is, I want them to feel exactly what I'm feeling when it comes to that point in their dogs life.
All dogs  go to Poland
Sometimes you have to carry your family. Simple as that. What a legend.
I will purchase that woman a wagon!
That's true love
The more I read about Ukrainians, the more respect I have for them! 👍
Modern day hero.
No good boy left behind
Genuinely curious,  why did she have to carry the dog that far?
The amount of literal idiots in the comments…
I'd do anything for my dog. This woman did everything for her dog. Respect.
This lady is my heroe. So is every person taking their doggo('s) and cat(s) to safety. My heroes are also those staying behind taking care of multiple pets and other animals, like farm animals, animals in shelters and animals in zoo's. God bless them all. I wish them all the best.
I no longer have words for this.
That's 10 and 1/2 miles for Americans! I am one of them. I had to look it up! Fucking badassery! You fuckers ROCK!!!! 

keep that shit up.
r/nextfuckinglevel
Somebody get her a wagon!!!
I wish I could give her a wagon :(
Doggo would have done the same if he could
The way it should be! Some people abandon their pets because they choose to move somewhere that doesn’t allow pets. It’s disgusting. Glad to see the better side of humanity
Do they not have wagons in Ukraine?
My dog is only 8kg and carrying her for a kilometre made me want to chop my arms off.

Sad that she is in this situation but happy for dog.
Omg I’m crying right now. God bless her ❤️ I know this is a dire very horrid situation but I’ve also seen the families who left their animals in backyards. Breaks my heart all the way around. But there are quite a few beautiful animal rescue organizations on the ground. Let’s not forget about them - risking their lives to save as many animals as possible from this F situation ie NETWORK FOR ANIMALS
A backpack and her dog. That's all she could bring to safety. And so many refugees (including those at the US southern border) have even less. This photo is amazing, and the implications appalling.
doubt it
“Ohana means family and family means no one gets left behind or forgotten”
you never know how strong you are until there is no choice left
surely not the entire 17km straight?  the dog could walk some of it right?
doubt it
It turns out that Ukrainians are the “patriots” that most Americans think they are. 

Everyday these people rewrite our definition of hero.
Doubt
[deleted]
no she didnt
Yeah, I'm going to need more proof that this actually happened.
I mean that's sweet but, can the dog not walk? I think I'm missing something here.
💙💛
Love these peoole
I love how everyone upvotes this just because of the title. No proof, no story. Just a title probably designed for karma. Well done, reddit. Well done.
17km my balls.

Just a quarter mile of walking and balancing 100 pounds on my shoulder causes considerable strain, and I'm at least twice as strong as most men.

I'd have elected for a cart or something else with wheels long before I hit that mark.
bruh couldnt she just let the dog walk with her or something lmao idk
A ~~Boy~~ Girl and ~~His~~ Her Dog
but why? the dig has double the legs then her
Did something happen to the dog that it couldn't walk next to her?
I love that puppy. And that human. Treats for both.
You don’t leave a man behind
This is beautiful. I've got two 14 year old dogs and ever since this gutting invasion began I've been looking at dog slings, hoping to rig something that would enable me to carry both of them if it ever became necessary. 

I hope wherever she ended up, her dog was made welcome. In the USA, womenn and children who find themselves homeless are forced to surrender pets in order to be granted shelter.
No pup left behind! Hope the best for them. ❤️🙏
Leave no dog behind.
Shit I'd make the dog walk. Gotta carry her 50lbs bag of dog food.
A shopping cart or wheelbarrow would’ve been more efficient.
I've been trying not to think about the pets situation in Ukraine right now. It's too sad.
No family members left behind!
I feel proud of her, but also sad knowing that might be the exact reason why a lot of elderly choose to stay
Sad !
"and what about when there was only one set of footprints?" - Dog
Slava Ukraini!
Cute!!!
Looks like the dog was like, damn that’s a long walk.
My cat won't even let me pick him up for 17 seconds.
Not surprised if she lived with that German Shepherd for 10-15 years.  They earn that kind of love.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
Ukrainians taking the American creed of "no man left behind" to the next level
I would have done the same thing
We all know the dog would do the same for her.
my heart.  ❤️
Doggo love triumphs all.
Thetr is still hope in some of humanity
This is what war is. Courage in unnecessary suffering
I hope as a lazy American I can pull this off if shit hits the fan here. 

11 miles carrying that much weight is inspiring.
Having to leave to survive...
Massive respect.
Awww💙💛🐾🐾🇺🇦
Only this will save us...UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.
Call me crazy...but I think the dog will do the same thing  for her !
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Why can't she "walk the dog"
Oh we had this conversation on another thread, I said I'd get my son's old pram out of the attic - if we had time of course.

Sending my love to both of them ❤️🇺🇦
Amazing woman!
No question, I wouldn't think twice about doing the same for my dog. Humans are so lucky to have dogs.
Jeez guys. This dog probably walked 15 or 16 of these KM. No way in hell she carried this dog that far.
Over and over I have seen Ukrainians taking their dogs and cats with them. Or hiding in bomb shelter with them. This is how it should be. Good people with their priorities straight.
Look fully support what she's doing but no way she carried that dog for the full 17km.
Whats that in freedom units?
That's 10 miles in freedom units and carrying what Americans call "my baby" also "my precious wittle baby"

A mile takes 15 to 22 minutes to walk. It takes me 30. So 2 hours and 30 minutes or 5 hours like me.
Well that's a bit doubtful. I'm pretty sure the dog walked quite a lot, nice picture though.
That’s love right there. I hope they are both okay.
17km????!!! She is INCREDIBLY STRONG, even a small dog can weigh a lot if you have to carry them for a long time
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together 😭❤️
Family is family
That hurts me so much!
Hero. Fucking hero.
u/juliedollxo
Why does she carry the dog? Is there something that means it can't / shouldn't walk?
I can’t even carry mine 3 mailboxes when taking him back home.
I'm pretty sure the person in the picture isn't a woman
Well bitch I ain’t leavin him.
Dog can't walk ?
He ain’t heavy, he’s my Rover
This is why people need dog trollies. German Shepards are DENSE and heavy af. This is true live right here
Ohana is family, family means nobody is forgotten or left behind. Aloha pono, slava uckrani.
Aww! The dog must have a sore paw/leg or something. What an amazing (and strong!) Human.

I'm guessing animal lovers will be looking at this.
...If you want to help the animals of Ukraine you can donate to an org called 'Four Paws' (there are others but that's the one I know of, and donated to.)
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thehansindia.com/amp/news/national/girl-from-kerala-returned-from-ukraine-with-her-dog-731540
Don't leave dogs behind
that dog looks heavy af. i bet when she put him down she couldn't feel her arms anymore. true love right there ❤️
She has Ukrainian Shepard
Woman got scammed by dog
Best news today.  Love them both.
How is this aww? This is sad...
Some human should learn from her :(
This women earns all the Cookies ever baked
To anyone who has to go through something this terrible.

**Get shopping carts from your local grocery store**.

They can be padded with blankets for children or pets.

As long as there's pavement or asphalt, you can roll them anywhere.

They can be tied together or pushed by more than one person.

They can be used to make a quick shelter should you have to spend the night outside.
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.
Get that lady a wagon!
And this is an example of why I asked for sites to donate specifically for pets of Ukraine..
Russia is evil.
No she didn’t. She couldn’t carry that dog 500m like that.  For one, that dog would barely be able to breathe with its weight on its belly like that.  For another, it’s not like they don’t have wagons, wheelbarrows, carts, etc in Ukraine.
Lmao…I’d like to see any redditor who believes this carry a dog that big just 2 miles and see how your body handles it. I’d love to see the look on your face as you realize how dumb you are for believing this war propoganda….
Frigin badassary.
Earthlings 🕊️💕🎶

😭😭😭😭😭
This is the way.
Love❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️
The animals situation honestly upsets me more than the people. Pets and wildlife in a war zone.
🇺🇦🐕❤️
That is love and it’s amazing. Bravo
Hats off to this woman.
She is an amazing human being
Over 10 miles! Her strength, courage and determination is incredible!
Old boys stay with their people...I'd do the same for my old boy.
That is part of her family she is caring.
That's what you do for family
Now that’s true love
Sure she did
Would do the same for both of mine.
Hey I get it I've been forced to live in my RV and had to sell my house and I got my 4 loves with me, all dogs, and they are just happy they get to still be with Daddy! Their my everything! Whatever it takes
I love the dog's face it just screams " I have no idea what's going on, but I'm tired so I sleep."
Leaving a buddy behind is not even an option. Shouldn't even be thinked of ! He would NEVER, EVER, leave you behind.
I hope Ukrainian beats Russia’s ass!
I simply love stories like this. I would carry both of my puppies really dogs in age.they are both at least 20 years old and don't get around too good so I would get them there. I love them so much. both are incontinent andmy poodle is blind. I will watch them to the time ends.
As you should. I have two kids two cats and a bunny. I have a plan for everyone’s safekeeping if I die. But idk what id do if there was a war. I’ve thought it out and it makes me so sad.
Incredible. At 66 yrs of age I wouldn’t be able to do this but I would sure try
This is what love looks like
I would do the same...
This just made me cry so hard, and At Work! \*sniffle, sniffle\* Oh my goodness, this just breaks my heart into a million shards of glass. What a kind soul who unconditionally loves her dog. I know I would do the same, but good luck to her and lucky mr. doggo! May their travels be safe!!!!
For some people dogs or other animals are kids to them and have an incredible bond and love for one and other! I don’t make a difference between human kids or dogs. After all we are all animals and we all have a right to live on this planet!!!
God bless here and her dog.  Thanks for no big quarantine at the border for the pet.  That is a very close loved one!!! God bless the Ukrainian people and surrounding countries taking them in!!!  To H. With Russia (USSR).  What do they want with Ukraine?
Damn right id carry my best friend over that border too! You don't leave family behind.
And then they treated the dog better at the border than black men and women.
I would do the same
God bless this woman and I hope they are safe
I have an old dog and I would carry him to the end of the world if I had to
my dog is 16 years old and i would do this for him. i could never leave him behind. if i physically couldnt then i would stay with him. i just could never leave my dog behind especially after all we been through after 16 years.
It's a pic of someone holding a dog.  Media playing tricks with your minds
Did she not have a leash? Can it not walk?  This is missing some context
People have been waiting 48 hours or more at the border in line. I would ditch my car and get out and walk as well!
The suffering caused to innocent animals is usually overlooked in a war sadly. 
Russia is not winning anything in this war. Time to pack up and go home really.
Ok I see a picture of a woman with injured dog on her shoulder and a title that she carried it for 17km to safety which is a lot. How do I know that this story is true? There is no other information, not where and from she was going, not how long it took her, no gps records so idk could be true could be fake is my conclusion on this. This is how I now read every post on social media.
Was she aware that the dog has legs?
Good on her for not leaving the old pup behind. But I would find a wagon or wheelbarrow. As an owner of a GSD they can be on the heavy side. Work smarter not harder.
I would have done the same thing. My dog is one of the closest family members I have.
[removed]
Was the dog injured and couldn't walk?
Hell I would too. Never leave family behind ❤️
No pup left behind.
Proving they really are made of Ukranium.
I'd totally carry my dog 17km that being said my dog is only 15lbs not a German Shepard so that's not too much of a brag.
There is no circumstance in which this should *ever* have to occur
Because **You're goddamned right she did**.
Full story ❤️ https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/08/ukraine-russia-crisis-border?fbclid=IwAR3jiV1h1lCDRJc6LNcnKMw7hN-ZvVh8TfnJZrPqHAiomU9X06I2kZsl8Hs
No she didn't.

Also... not that old.
I can’t believe any captioned photo anymore.
Poor dog. Doesn’t even get to walk
That dog is approximately 70lbs.  No way she carried that dog more than 100 meters.  17km lmao.
I would have carried her and her dog, if it meant the dog made it too.

My old guy had a carpal arthrodesis after a dislocation and struggled with stairs at our old home. I carried him every day gladly up and down those stairs and he never worried a bit. Eventually could handle the porch steps by himself and even up the flight of stairs by himself... but never wanted to go down alone again. 

Nothing motivated me into buying my now ranch home more. 3 small steps are all he ever has to worry about now. It's amazing what motivated people will do (and for their pets).
Ohana means family,
why couldn't it walk?
Aww, I'm curious about why he couldn't/wouldn't walk, but more importantly I'm very happy they are both safe.  Fuck this war.
Poor lady and her dog. Walking 17km while carrying a dog over your shoulder must be tiring. If it were me, I would try to find a cart or stroller or even a wheel barrow to let the dog ride on it
Ok
Could she have just let it walk? I mean, dogs do have legs. Just curious...
Fake.. take a picture of the girl pushing a car through the border and title it “girl pushed her car for 17km”
His poor belly on that spiky shoulder! At least put a towel over your shoulder or something while your refugee-ian! Do your thing && good lookin out taking your pup with you. My Charlie would probably be pulling me by the end of the 14th kilometer… and everyone is welcome in Polska. Don’t let the old conservative grandpa’s in power tell you otherwise, *everyone* is welcome.
Carrying precious cargo.
Dog is thinkin’..Homie I can walk.
Why don't the dog just walk itself?
What’s wrong with its legs?
No she didn’t
No she didn’t
Cool story, but doubt it.
Even ukrainian women are tough as rock with balls of steel.
If you're not crying happy tears upon seeing this wonderment, you should be.
She should be getting drafted. But nooo. Only the men get that privilege. Either do the whole equality thing or get rid of the draft completely.
[deleted]
If only they have some legs
I fucking love Ukrainians
You either understand this or are dead inside.
That’s badass but can the dog not walk?
Stupid question... Why couldn't the dog walk? If the dog is to old or sick or whatever why not find a wheelbarrow, or make a sled, or a sling, or almost anything else that makes more sense/is more believable than this? I would really hate to believe somebody is using a war to farm for Internet points but... I'm not really buying it.
let the dog walk
Dog can't walk?
Dog can’t walk?

That's unbelievably good. That's easily a 75 lb dog at the least. No way it let her carry it that whole way.
Man, I put down my dog this past Sunday. Pictures like this hit different now.
It's so sad that people have to go through this.
Whats wrong with his legs?
But really the doggos carry us.
That dog would do the same for her if he could
Like other have said it looks like a old shepherd mix, guessing in the 60lb range.  It is very common old shepherd/shepherd mix having back leg issues and pretty much dragging their back legs.  Been there done that it was about the worst time of my life on par with my oldie cat with back leg issues.

With that said it is impressive for anyone - if true - that carried a 60lb dog for 17km, most people can't walk 17km a day with a 20lb backpack.
And deji couldn't win a fight against a jokeman.
He buddy, we’re going on the longest walk, you’re such a good boy
My 82 yo mother has started doing extra walking and “work outs” since the invasion because she figures she might have to be able to walk to the border if it becomes a “world war”. I don’t have the heart to tell her that we live in a place that will be nuked to oblivion in the first wave of hostility….

What true love looks like
Ohana means family!
I can see some white in his face, he's an old man pupper. 
He is probably tired of walking..
Glory to Ukraine 🇺🇦
Any dog owner would carry their puppy to the ends of the world if needed!  🙌♥️

Where did she cross the border?

Слава Украине слав героям слава собака
dogs can walk?
God bless her, I hope she finds a place that's animal friendly.
spam account
When I look at what's going on and imagine having to do it myself and my 3 cats (23lbs, 17lbs, and 13 lbs) I know that I'll just lay down and die, and give the cats plenty of meat to survive on for the rest of their lives. 

I am too fat. They are too fat.
I wish there was a way to get in touch with these people. I have a harness meant for carrying large dogs on your back, would ship it out asap. Along with dog treats, lots of em.
I would do anything for my dog I wish she was still here though she passed away yesterday 😞
Ukrainians are amazing!
Get her a shopping cart with all terrain wheels
Some context:  
  
"My dog is 12 and a half and she struggled to walk and fell down every kilometre or so and couldn’t stand up again. I stopped cars and asked for help but everyone refused; they advised us to leave the dogs. But our dogs are part of our family. My dog has experienced all the happy and sad moments with us. Mum’s dog is all she has left of her former life. So my husband, at times, carried our dog on his shoulders."

G’D bless everyone in Ukraine. Those who take care of the helpless or in dire need are blessed infinitely.
God bless her hope they made the long trek safe 💙💛
That’s bad ass
Beautiful 😍
And no doubt her backpack is full of food, water and a toy for her dog and nothing for her.
Love this
Family
Couldn't it walk??
Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind… Or forgotten!
And food for the dog in the backpack.  Every material thing in her life-left behind.
Do they not have leashes in Ukraine??
Very Good
beautiful ukraine people
I had to carry my pudgy chihuahua like a half mile and then up a few flights of stairs and by the end my arms were on fire. This chick loves her bud. Good for them hope they made it somewhere warm and safe 🤞
Nice hope the dog is doing well
I really hope that this image is used in history books. It and it's description communicate so much about the auxiliary effects of war, for how trivial it seems at first glance.
That bond is so wonderful..
That’s her child no matter how old that doggie gets. I would do the exact same thing. ❤️
Dang how much does a dog like that weigh?

They need to make a pup backpack for emergencies.
Humanity has not yet passed away. Salute to her
Why wish my dog treated me like that 😭😭😭😭😭
I’ve noticed how many Ukrainians have their pets with them as they evacuate. This is both heart warming and gut wrenching
This actually happened.
I hear the ghost of kiev carried his dog 170 kilometers to the border and downed 7 planes on the way back.
“I want to fight, mom!!”
There is so much love there
That bond id so wonderful.
❤️
UKRAINE NOT WEAK!!
What a legend 🇺🇦🐶.
What else do you do?
Oof-  I would do that because he can only walk around the block, but I’m looking at him and am not quite sure how.  She is impressive
We read yesterday that if we need to go to a public bomb shelter (in Finland), we aren't allowed to bring our dog :((
Dogs have great quality of faithful, so she is also proving her faith with dog.
Ukraine will persevere. Ukraine has more spirit, more heart, & more indomitabiity than anyone could have ever thought possible. These amazing people are a daily inspiration & reminder to me, that this could be us. I challenge any American citizen to try to convince me that Ukraine is the greatest country in the world. The United States cannot make this claim. We are sadly one of the most un-united countries in this world. It both saddens & inspires me. Slava Ukraini 🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦Edit: …”Ukraine is not the greatest country on earth. America cannot make that claim”
I would too. He was a 100lb German shepered.  He is a tad easier to carry now that he is compacted in a box tho, travel size for my convince gotta say. 💀
❤
Faithinhumanityrestored
So sweet I love this I would do the same for my animal.
The sky, the ground... It looks very cold there.
She is a work horse, I mean that positively
After looking at the title and the picture,  all I can see is Jaiden(animations) grabbing hushchild(whismur) and saying "you're coming with me."
Respect. Doggo don't like to walk?
Years ago I took my dog to the vet, the vet said does your dog bite if I stick a thermometer in his rectum? I said I don’t know, we never do that at home.
Source?
This is just a picture with a dog on her shoulder. Did you just make up the 17km part or is this one of those news stories passed along by oral tradition?
I mean, why let the dog walk himself, right?
Just beautiful.
Why can’t the dog just walk
Strong ppl
That is very heartwarming and I would do the exact same thing bring me with my pets… but why could the dog not walk at least most of the way?.... Maybe I'm missing something or she did not have a leash? You would think it would  Stay with her though if it was her dog…. but what do I know 🤷‍♂️.... I would carry all of my pets on my back as far as I had to before leaving them anywhere... that truly are too good for us.... Especially my cat hes better than all of us, and he knows it 😆
Doggo "where we going mama??" 
Mom "were going to a new place with lots of other doggos for you to play with my friend"
I would have done the same. Go girl.
Ukrainians are just built different.
I don't understand.... My old dog are very strong, I get tired first when we walk / hike for miles
😢
But why? The dog couldn't walk or something?
Deeply moved and tearing up. God bless her and the senior dog. Praying they re safe.
They are family. You don't leave family behind.
What’s wrong with the dog’s legs?
r/animalsarederps
gosh this could be any random dog y'all really fall for any title
Why couldn’t the dog walk🧐
#IStandWithTheUkraine
Dogs be like - why do you humans build so many things on our land, and then destroy them?
A true badass 🐾👍
You could have probably used a wagon or something

Don't see how likely it is that she carried a 60 lb dog a half marathon distance lmao
Yes it's lovely but I mean..... Dogs have legs and can walk
Why though? The dog can walk..
Dogs can walk
Does she know that dogs can walk on their own?
Why don’t they just let…..the dogs…use their legs…..?
That’s truly impressive, he’s not exactly small.  That dog must be very loved
💜
God bless her!
Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind or forgotten.
I know this a victorious feel good story so I hate be this girl but uhh can the dog not walk ? Lol
Edit ahhh old dog I c now derp
was the dog hurt and couldn't walk? D:
There's no fkn way she carried that 17km
[removed]
Bless that lady and her pup. May they find safety and shelter and peace.
Do the 4 legs not work?
My heart just breaks for these people.
I'll give her money for being so awesome.
No dog gets left behind! 💕
Just beautiful.
I would too!!!!
WOW.

I told myself I wasn't going to read anymore heart wrenching articles to protect my mental health. This...this both touches the soul a certain way and also begs for tears because....WHY?!?!

Glad I saw this.
Much respect. I’d do the same but am American w a 4.5lb dog. the 3 cats might be more of a concern Bc they all weight 2-3x as much.
He's got sore paws or something?
Why?  Doesn’t she have a leash?
What's wrong with the dog? I feel German Sheppards is a breed who may prefer to tag alone using their paws.
So wholesome 🥺
Worth pointing out that a hugely disproportionate amount of "Russian military success" throughout history was really *Ukranian* military success, when Ukraine was a territory of the Russian empire. 

Feels relevant to point this out not just for the current world events but also for the wonderful woman in this OP.
❤️
So a typical Ukrainian.
Wow the relationship between the dog and her wow
I truly hope she makes it safe and well along with the other civilians
Are there no shopping trolleys in Ukraine?
Keep no person behind, keep no animals behind. God bless all the innocent lives in Ukraine 🇺🇦 ❤️
Can dogs walk 🤯😳
This is less r/aww and more like r/humansaremetal or r/aboringdystopia
This just makes me sad
next fucking level if i've ever seen it....
Godspeed dear Ukranian
Given that Ukrainian men have to drag around giant balls of titanium it doesn’t surprise me that Ukrainian women likewise have ovaries of uranium and can therefore easily carry a 100 lb dog
No pets should get left behind
Not surprised. I would do the same for my dog.
“I still don’t understand why you won’t use my leash but honestly I kinda like this” -Doggo
Someone get this poor girl a leash
I can’t believe that Russia is trying to fight these people with superhuman capabilities!
For the Americans that’s about 10 miles
get a wheelbarrow ffs
I would never eat that
Yanks need to send over those red wagons they put pets in, the one you see in whimsical 90's kids films
Famn.  this is some shiet. Powerful photograph. Making me tear up :(
That's what you do for family.
Awesome
She is my hero and my dogs hero. What a gal.
Twice....twice today I've watched a fur missile so beloved by its owner brought to safety in this fucking mess. I'm furious. Hug your families and fur friends tighter folks.
OR, OR, hear me here, JUST TO THE CAR. But we will never know cuz free internet pointz for OP.
Riiiiiight!
I hope everyone make it through that shit alive and unharmed
Her dog won't ever forget her kindness.
Needs a toddler wagon. 

I feel like talking some time to carve out of wood would be worthwhile here if you can't buy one.
she didnt have a leash?
I have a 140 lbs Cane Corso and Jesus if she was older and needed me to carry her by God I'd walk that distance for my dog. What a person tho
Use a leash?
:)
Over 10 miles with a dog that size which would weigh something like 40kgs is unlikely sorry, its a nice story though.
I'd do the same for my chihuahua....
There are no lengths I wouldn’t go to for my dog. It’s an indescribable love.
Taking  only the essentials!
Guarantee it walked a large portion. Still very sweet and commendable
I love this lady and her dog. I couldn't stop crying when I saw this. I'm so upset about what's happening in Ukraine. The past few years have been almost unbearable.
Thank you
This is great and all but is there a source? I mean any person can add any title to any image.
r/humansbeingbros
Poor doggy. It was probably so confused and tired :’(
Mad respect.
This touched my heart. I would do the same for my senior pup. ❤️
She gonna smell like dog pee but they’re both gonna live
If she can carry her fur baby ya'll can let them inside
As a former dog walker in New York, I feel that
I would guess he's uncomfortable but he still looks pretty happy
russian will say it's fake
😭😭 This melts my heart. I would do that for my pup too. Sending prayers for their safety 💗
Family.
The dog couldn't walk?
That takes some serious strenght and endurance.

Slava ukraini!
Truly a hero
I call bullshit
![gif](giphy|YSZSwoMaBwfqkYOgEk|downsized)
I heavily, heavily doubt that this woman carried that dog for 17km.

Why lie?
Put any false headline; receive karma.
Fucking why though? It’s a dog. Put it on a leash and let it walk
As a person who does not know very much about dogs, nor much about wartorn places. What is hindering the dog from jusr walking next to its owner?
Can't the dog walk?
Dogs can walk too, it's not a baby 😂
Does anybody know if there are organisations to help pets in Ukraine right now? I'd love to donate money to help them
Probably gonna get downvoted but aren't dogs more than capable of walking? Seems like an attention grab. ( The situation is terrible though )
Best friends forever !![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)
Foldable cart. Great for groceries and moving heavy items.
I am surprised she didn't get some kind of blanket or something and wrapped the dog up in it and carried it like a big backpack.
That's so sweet 🥺
why the dog literally has 4 legs
omg, this made me cry
Really getting a Fallout 4 vibe here.
💖💖❤️
Because?
That is because the Ukrainians are badass 😎
The dog could walk too lol
Dog has citizenship in Germany
If you have a big dog like this, you should train this [Carrystyle](https://imgur.com/gallery/mi7lPMa)  way more comfortable for Both.
This is so wholesome, I’ve seen thousands of cases in Ukraine where people simply abandoned their pets. This woman is the best
How is this cute?
😭♥️♥️♥️
No best friends left behind.
Awww, I love this! What a good hearted person!
This is a Devine Intervention.  I’m so moved.  Inspired by Hebrew Law. This dog had a job and a purpose alongside this heroic woman. She will not abandon.
That is love🥰🥰
what a beautiful human being, i wish her the best and i wish i could help her and her dog out
Glory to Ukraine!!
Respect
Luckily my cats will always follow me so I'd be carrying my dog and making sure my Two cats are keeping up. I couldn't imagine ever leaving them behind. We all stay or we all go. 

If I'm lucky, I'll never personally be involved in war as long as I live and if I'm luckier still I'll have tons of wonderful furry friends in this life.
Salute!!
I can imagine this situation... I couldn't leave my animals behind... This hurts!
Why didn't she used a leash
Respect for that lady, you rock ❤️
Sadge ...hope you guys the best
What a gigachad
Dawh 🥺
A picture of how to be a loving pet mama.
In every way Ukrainians are badasses
What a Hero and lucky doggo.   


Is there any way to contact her? I would like to send her and her dog some help
❤️🌻❤️
dogs like walking so why is she carrying him
So why didn't the dog walk tho
This is beautiful but is there a reason they couldn't just walk it together. Most dogs are generally fitter than humans.

Although I guess all the chaos may have scared the poor pup
Beautiful
I'd do the same for my pets. Good for her, and her doggo.
So this is roughly the equivalent to carrying that dog around a football field 40 times?
i dont get it?  dogs can walk farther and faster than humans
Oh, my heart :( I hope both of them are safe now. I'm gonna go hug my dog
Jesus, someone get that woman a wagon.
Beautiful!
Also, for everyone asking why she didn't just let the dog walk, as an owner of 2 elderly dogs both in the past and currently, older dogs can't walk very far without seriously risking hurting themselves. That's one reason of many elderly dogs get put into shelters, they take more TLC. It says right in the title it's an older dog.
All this shit from the war that’s in r/nextfuckinglevel and r/aww should be in r/awfuleverything
Why carry the dog, surely he'd be quicker on foot? Unless there is of course loud bangs, than over my should would be the only way I could take my dog any direction I wanted to go
Hope they’re both at safe place now,resting together
Dogs make us better people. Those of us who have them.
I would do the same. I could never leave a dog behind.
Ik that’s right
WoW! This is so heartwarming. I pray to God that she will be safe with her dog. Such a good human being!
awwe such a beautiful dog kind of like a fluffy baby bear i wish someday i could have one myself just like the one here
Pure love...
gg
i just want to hug and kiss and keep telling it how much i love you and that i would do anything to keep you safe just like how the owner is doing in the picture
❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🇺🇦❤️🥰❤️🥰🇺🇦❤️
That's my fucking hero
This is what love looks like
Jesus I need to get off my ass because these people are doing great things out of necessity and I’m doing jack shit because I take everything for granted. What a wonderful person. I’d do the same with my dogs.
Wait till she finds out the dog can move on it’s own
I believe that's a man. I saw an item on the news about this family and their journey to safety.
❤️
Truly a great human.
It's beautiful that not even animals are left behind and that they are also taken in without sending away. But is the dog hurt that he could not walk? Does anyone know the story behind this?
I bet she leaves no dwarf behind
I'm glad a lot of dogs end up with people like that.
What happened to leashes???
Why can’t the dog walk
I'm surprised she couldn't find a cart, stroller, something with wheels
as always never leave animals behind.
Humanity still exists. Happy to see that Ukrainian save the pets ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)
That’s a man…. And he didn’t carry the dog all of 17km
