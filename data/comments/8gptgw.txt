This good girl greyhound wins the race to my heart.
Rescue.... and really far back ears... is she a retired racing greyhound? :D I always wanted to adopt one when I was a kid 
Santos L. Halper
This is the best picture I've seen 2018. Amazing. Can't stop smiling.
My family adopted a rescued racer when I was a kid. She was the sweetest. Such a dainty lady with plenty of personality. Such good dogs!
Actually read alot this morning, about people who own grayhounds. They all say they are the goofiest dogs and usually are incrude (sp?) by failed fostering. 
She looks like a model! 
I may be opening myself up to downvotes here, but whatever. Novel inbound.

I was born into a greyhound racing family. My father was a third-generation racer, so my entire early life's memories revolve around going into the kennel to see 120 of my favorite friends. It was never surreal for me to be surrounded by 40 dogs at one time that were all as tall as me. Just a part of life.

I grew up in that kennel, gaining more responsibilities and working my ass off as I grew. It was tough work. Endless cleaning, grooming, feeding, training, exercising, walking, sprinting, etc. Honestly, it was awful work (especially that we were in Phoenix and a good portion of our job was outdoors).

The thing that made it worth it, though? The animals themselves. A few too many bad apples spoiled the barrel with regards to kennel owners, hence all the negative press over the years. Was it undeserved? No. There WERE some shady fucks out there who were just as bad as the press made them out to be. But were all owners like this? Definitely not.

My dad (and his father and grandfather) understood very early on that these are animals with minds of their own and feelings and emotions. They knew if the dogs felt safe and comfortable, it would only help them to be more successful at the track. We'd spend a lot of time in the kennel goofing around with the dogs, jumping around, getting literally 30 dogs at one time to do group zoomies (which isn't hard with greyhounds lol), and hoisting up 85-pound males into our arms like babies just to see their mleps. It was always part of the gig; shitty manual labor with a side of world's best petting zoo, except every morning we'd come back in and continue to build relationships with them

Because my dad respected the greys, once the writing on the wall started coming true and the Phoenix track looked to be in dire straights, my dad offered Arizona Adopt-a-Greyhound space on his kennel lot to house their pre-adopted dogs. We oversaw their care jointly with the nonprofit to be able to have post-racing options for all of our dogs while still maintaining our relationships with them. This wound up being very successful on a number of fronts, mainly that people could come down, meet us, and learn all about the dogs from the people who've cared for them the last X years. My brother STILL literally goes to their meetups every month to cut dog nails and share stories and see the few greys he personally knew that are still kicking it today.

When the track (and our business with it) finally went under in late 2008 (I was 18 then), I was sad. How could I not be? It was something that was so deeply rooted in my family for so long and that I spent literally my entire life caring about. But would I have wanted it to remain? No. Greyhound racing had its chance, and that chance was ruined by the bad apples. Was it always fair to the dogs? Of course not. So it was a "if you love it, let it go" situation.

I still find the various adoption/rescue groups around the state at community pet events and offer to take them for walks. They're always skeptical until I tell them my last name and who my father/grandfather are, then they let me take 5 out around the block for a jog no problem.

My favorite post-racing story I have is that my wife and I traveled to London and Dover for a good vacation last year. At an Air BnB in Dover, the lady we stayed with had a dinky little 60-pound male greyhound, all white with some red on his tail and ears. She explained we need to take it slow around him and that he has abandonment issues from the gypsies he was saved from. No shit, I sit down on the couch, he looks at me from across the room, I look back for a good 10 seconds, and he comes waddling over. I grab his ear and tug on it, and he jumps up in my lap and sprawls out across me, burying me in the soft cushions. The lady was so freaked out, all she could do was gasp. "Wow, I've never seen him do anything like that with anybody, not even me!" I smiled, rubbing his spotted tummy, and said "Guess I just got the touch" and left it at that.

These creatures are beautiful, calm, intelligent, dilligent, creative, emotional, and passionate. Thank you to everyone who has had a greyhound as a pet. Every time I see someone walking one down a street or at a park, my soul gets a little lighter.
How do you find them, both as a breed and as a rescue?

My wife and I have thought about getting one. We've read a fair bit on it, but I always like hearing from people who own them.

We know a few people who have had really good experiences, but a few others, who have had really negative experiences, tried to talk us out of it.
Gorgeous!
Why are the ears folded-out/ back?
Now I want Kehinde Wiley to do a pet series. 
So beautiful. I used to have two rescue greyhounds - they were lovely and even a little bit whimsical looking. 
That's an exemplary Anxiety Deer you've got, there. 
What does it rescue?
Those eyes and tongue poking out are sooo cute! 
This was just in Melbourne last weekend aye? We got out dog done also! 
Is she as derpy as she looks in this pic? Cute dog though.
There‚Äôs something about pets with a handkerchief around their neck that makes my heart melt.

This is so great. We just hooked up with a greyhound rescue organization and we're hoping to be matched with one in the next few weeks. Can't wait!
Very adorable pupper! 12/10, would boop the snoot

You know I‚Äôm already struggling not to adopt one from a nearby race track. The factors stopping me is time and money: mainly cause it would be unfair to the dog. This is not helping me resist...
As a professional photographer, it makes me so happy when people are ok with goofy pictures. So many people have unrealistic expectation for children and animals.
I love when Greyhounds hit aww.

Oh ! This was in Collingwood Melbourne right ? I watched my friend take her puppy to it !  
Thanks for letting us know it was a rescue.
Is rescue dog the new vegan? I feel like I know anyone that owns a rescue dog. 
People who rescue dogs will do anything to tell you ‚Äúit‚Äôs a rescue‚Äù
Why do you *need* to announce you have a "rescue" Greyhound, when it has no bearing on this post?

Haha I love these dogs. I want one so badly but my girlfriend doesn't want a dog currently, and she dislikes 'ugly' dogs, like pugs and.. greyhounds. Though I think greyhounds look great and athletic.

I've been playing youtube videos titled 'why you should get a dog'  and 'why greyhounds are the best' every night on speaker whilst she's asleep to try and influence her through her dreams... no succes so far.
What places do dog portraits?  
The background suggests this should be framed and hung over a fireplace

This is perfect meme material.

I am not a pet person, but I would definitely adopt your  dog. 
If you feel attacked enough to be upset by the mention of the word rescue, you should probably not own an animal. Cripes these comments.

I love my greyhound so much and he's also a rescue. Unfortunately the previous owners didn't feed him right and it messed up his teeth so he had to have surgery to get most removed. So now his tongue hangs out the side of his mouth but his the most adorable derp ever.

Why do people use the term "rescue" when describing their pet?

There is no such breed as a rescue greyhound

Just fucking say "took my greyhound..."

Peoole dont say, "i took my adopted kid for ice cream" .... 
Firstly a huge thank you for rescuing a greyhound. I work in a vets where we do a lot of work with the Retired Greyhound Trust and they are such fabulous dogs. They are so loving. If I didn't have two cats and a tiny flat, I would definitely have one. And secondly, she is a stunner. Gorgeous girl. Please hug her for me.
Hey guys have you met my RESCUE? I RESCUED him. He is the best RESCUE. RESCUE RESCUE RESCUE RESCUE. 
It‚Äôs literally my dream to rescue a greyhound!! How adorable!! 
greyhounds are so sensitive and loving. I'm glad you rescued her.

I've always wondered - how are Greyhounds in retirement?  Are they very energetic?  Do they run around a lot?  Or are they more docile since they are not competing any more?

Beautiful dog, by the way.  I love the photo with the tongue sticking out!
I'm getting a Dory vibe from those eyes.

Poor thing has that hideous scarf 
Back in the day our facility had a adopted race greyhound from the (now closed) Dog Race Park in Texas City, Texas. 

That dog farted more than any dog I had ever been around. We had it on a specialty food from the vet to try and help. 


Soooooo

We would be sitting at the fest and Cruiser (dogs name) would be in his bed under the seat. If you were standing there talking you couldn‚Äôt see Cruiser. And then ‚Äúfaaaaaaarrrrrrrrtttttt‚Äù like 10 seconds 8 octaves. 

So the person standing there just hears a fart. Embarrassing!!

He was a great pup!!

When you refer to your dog, do you always have to qualify your altruism by making sure people know its a rescue? 
My boyfriend's parents got this done for their rescue pup. They ended up turning down all the perfectly posed shots and got the picture of her with her tongue out and head cocked in every form. They now have mugs, calendars, and a few framed photos of her looking cute as fuck. 
She is adorable!

Greyhounds are cool dogs. 
I‚Äôve laughed for several minutes at this little doofus. And the noodle horse comment for several more. 
I recently started volunteering at an animal rescue centre and there's so many dogs that I didn't realise were absolutely beautiful and full of personality. Greyhounds are one of them. So loving!
Thank God you said it was a rescue or I wouldn't have loved it as much XXX.

Old time Grayhound story: Back in the 30's my mother's neighbor raised Grayhounds for hunting jack rabbits. They would head out to a field and walk with the hounds till a rabbit popped up. The owner, Mr. Avery would turn one Grayhound loose and it would chase the rabbit in a huge circle around the field. Always turning the rabbit back towards dad. As they pass by he would turn a second hound loose and it would take over the chase while the first hound would sit by Mr. Avery and recover. As the second hound completed the circle he would release the first hound again. By now the rabbit is totally exhausted and just kind of bouncing along ready to collapse. The first hound would quickly close the gap and take him. She said it was amazing to watch the chase and how well trained the dogs were. I doubt this is practiced anywhere in the US anymore, lost to history. 
Worried derp is worried.
Might be a nice thing to credit the [photographers](http://www.dogphotogstudios.com/)!

If you are a vegan, marathon runner, who has a rescue, how do you decide which you mention first?
I love that you rescued!  What a pretty dog!  Congrats!

Is any dog adopted from a shelter or pound a rescue dog? I have a dog I adopted from a shelter and I just need to know if I should cash in on that sweet, sweet karma.
How do you know if someone has a rescue dog?  They'll tell you.
Oh my god, you rescued a dog. You're suuuuch an amazing person.
Heckin fren!

Doin a blep.
"Blep for me, baby!"

Is it necessary to mention it's a "rescue?"

It's so odd to have a savior complex about getting a dog from the pound-- something people have been doing for decades and didn't used to make a big deal out of.
guaranteed this wouldn't reach top without the work "rescue"
I got downvoted for saying mlem. Well alright.
Thats why I dont rescue, they come broken
My cats a rescue...who wants to pat me on the back?

A lot of people post breeder dogs on here and get a ton of upvotes but people like you are the true heroes. Have an upvote.
What an ugly dog 
‚ÄúI took my lactose intolerant greyhound to get its photo taken!‚Äù

Which part was unnecessary?
why do people have to emphasize that they own a rescue?
*rescue*
Why not just say "took my dog"? Why does everyone need to know what a hero you are?
Most people who aren‚Äôt trying to fish for karma just call it a regular dog.
that is one ugly dog bruh
She's adorable! Love the blep! üòã
Greyhounds are so high strung it's crazy.

Xpost to r/mlem!!
Edit: noob
You don't live around the UK, brum area do you? Used to date a girl called Alice with an identical greyhound! 
Oh really you rescued this dog, what did you pay for it? My girlfriend 'rescued' a dog by getting drunk and having one of those crazy rescue ladies just give it to her. Furthermore canines are capable animals derived from wolves with sharp teeth and strong jaw bones. If anyone needs saving its the owners of these 'rescue' dogs most of the time.

You know how I know you have a rescue? Also are you off gluten by chance?
