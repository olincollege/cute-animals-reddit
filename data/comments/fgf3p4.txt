Oh shit, it's discovered that humans have furniture. My parents' beagle did that and now this is how she spends 90% of her days.
Poor guy just needed a place to nap.
I really like foxes
So fluffing cute
Shhh he sleep
Friendly PSA: Foxes are one of the major carriers of mange. If you have pets and see foxes in your yard, be sure to keep an eye on your pet's skin. If you suspect your local foxes of having mange, there are ways to treat them in the wild. Contact your local wildlife conservation organization for help.
This is so cute. I bet it would play with dog toys that were left out too!
I love foxes, they‚Äôre like dogs but act like cats. Hahah they‚Äôre so funny, look at his lil legs! Aaaaah he‚Äôs so relaxed I love him. Name him and hope he comes back to chill another time
Where does the fox lay?
Looks like Firefox crashed at your place
Smart as a fox
It is the time of year to have thier pups. So a lot of foxes will come into neighborhoods rather than chance it with the Coyotes. Humans are the lesser of two evils I guess.
I used to party at a house in the forest just out of town. And it had a fox family that we used to throw whatever we were eating down to. There was a deck like 15 feet off the ground that we used to chill on and smoke. So we could just toss some tri tip down there or whatever we were eating and the foxes would come out of the forest and eat in front of us. We had a fox living in our neighborhood for years but it was skittish so I only saw it rarely, usually early in the morning. Having birds squirrels and raccoons around is something that you really take for granted when you have it goin on in your backyard. Where I live now I don't see nearly as many animals and kinda miss having all that nature around every day.
Foxes are cute but they‚Äôre still wild animals. Be very careful if you have cats or other small animals that go outside, and whatever you do DO NOTT feed it.
This looks comfortable, i'll stay here!
awwwwü•∫ü•∞
Reminds me of Juniper and Fig!
They cheeky buggers, ain't they. The thought of rabies puts me off though...
Izza sleepyfox.  Don't wake up the sleepyfox!
foxes are great at a distance, but fuck me the smell and the noise, I dont know how people want them as pets.
Eave him alone, let him have his daily nap.
That fox looks so relaxed lol
I‚Äôd love to step into the mind of a wild animal when they first discover something like a sofa or a cushion. To them a safe and comfortable space is anywhere with a form of shelter, so when they lay on a sofa they must be like ‚Äúholy fucking shit, this is comfort beyond measure, how do these humans do it? I can‚Äôt go back, I won‚Äôt!‚Äù
Senko
don‚Äôt disturb him
Wow what peaceful bliss.
Wee one looks like they've had a hard day
That little smile :,)


IM MELTING
Lil dude straight up vibin'
*Plot twist:* OP is a taxidermist and is showing off their last piece of work.
He has had a long day
That's so cute. ‚ù§
Ah look, another animal I want to cuddle but shouldn‚Äôt
That‚Äôs not a fox that‚Äôs a good boi
Is he/she your pet now OORRRR??
I'm now convinced that foxes have realized that dogs lead a good life among humans and they figure they are ready to join their cousins in the pet pool.
Zero fox given.
He do be vibin doe
Gimme
Full on relaxation posture. Not even curled in a ball. This fox has been here before and knows its safe.
‚ÄúFound this house chilling in my backyard lol‚Äù -The Fox
Why are you in the fox‚Äôs house tho? That‚Äôs the real question here
"Firefox has crashed"
Tbh he kinda vibin
Bad things happen when wild animals become comfortable in human locations.
Netfox and chill
Omg I want to cuddle him
What state is this in?
ADOPT IT IMMEDIATELY PLZ
Tirefox.
We were wolves once, wild and wary, stealth and cunning, then we noticed you had couches.
Cute! I would not mind a fox chilling on my couch.
That's a good lil weirdo cat-dog. Seems pretty content with life right there.
Someone got blackout last night.... we've all been there before.
Put some food out there and you have an outdoor pet.  Unless, of course, it's not a good idea in which case, don't do that.
Thats probably the best sleep that fox has ever had, OP let him sleep there :)
everyone liked that
Goldifox
Looks comfy af
Taking a break from jumping over that lazy dog.
That was very cash money of you to put a couch out for him üòä
it looks like u have fences is it actually real hiw did the fox got there
I feel like you should bring him a glass of iced tea.
So do ya leave him cat or dog food?
0 fox given...
So...what did the fox say?
Did you speak to it? What did it say?
[deleted]
I bet he slept so good
You have a nice back porch and patio furniture
Let him rest, he‚Äôs had a long day.

Only fox news I'm interested in.
Me : It's a wild animal, leave it alone. Let it do its own thing.
Also me : Wants to slide a plate full of food and wants to pet it.
That‚Äôs not a fox...that‚Äôs a good f*ckin‚Äô boi
I love how he's just straight up vibing, living his best life
huHHHHHHHH

*Guys!  It‚Äôs a forest puppy!*
That fox is that lazy roommate that is always in college.
For a second I though you were outside and the fox was inside
probably the best sleep it ever had.
Foxes are basically 50% cat and 50% dog and nobody‚Äôs gonna convince me otherwise.
He slep
If this were my porch, this would be one of the best days of my life!
Looks like he spilled the ashtray.
Check that smile
The LOL in the title.... üòÇ killed me

Sleepy Boi

Afternoons are for napping. I don‚Äôt care what species you are.

Did it say something? If yes, what did the fox say?
Why your backyard bed is better than my bedroom bed?
Looks so darned content. That's my aim, to make my yard a place where any wild animal can feel content...
It's The Todd, you know, the canniest Todd on moss an mor
Outdoor furniture = cushy for outdoor animals.

Where do you live? I see all these fox pics, and I want to live somewhere where a fox hangs out in my yard.
Is nobody going to say anything about that anteater peaking out?
Lazy like a fox.

Nothing worse than Fox Piss!
Was this someone's pet at one time?
Sleep king
"The chicken was lovely. Naptime!"

Why doesn't this ever happen to me? Foxes are my favorite animal.
Just needs some lo-fi hip-hop beats for foxes to chill to
He‚Äôs a good boy
Oh my God you are so lucky I've always wanted to see a fox in person!!!

That smile!
He‚Äôs the captain now.
Mission passed
Aw.... I love this! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I was rewatching the fox and the hound my favorite movie when I was a smoll chubby boi. Now I'm a big chubby boi and this is a coincidence.
Sleepy animals are cute but sleepy animals sleeping like sleepy humans is the cutest
His little foxy smile is the best, hope the little guys having the best dream.
He‚Äôs so tired of giving Carfax‚Äôs
Or a trans-dog?
That's adorable <3
You see that smile? That is one happy fox!
Fuck yeah, Fox. Chill.
Omg, my heart. You should leave things out for the baby like a bowl of water and a toy/blanket they'll.paly with it and appreciate the rest. üòçüíó
LOL
Looks very comfy!
I like tacos.
 Awwüòç
Give it a diamond

My shepherd has claimed the queen guest bed. He sleeps in it every night all by himself. He's a big boy!
Stickied.

I watched it in a production environment
From now on, this fox is my spirit animal.
[deleted]
This fox knows what's up!
 Around where I live that there was a fox hanging around the neighborhood and people liked it at first and then it attacked a small dog and people started going nuts for the town to get rid of it.
Go pet. Now. Please.
Such a beautiful animal!!! Lucky you get to see wonders
What'd it say?
Such a happy foxie, he looks like he's smiling almost
What did it say?
Holy shit that's adorable. I dont think Fox's are native where I live because somehow I havent seen one despite living on a ruralish property, but God I would love to. That being said I like my chickens alive so it might not be the best outcome.
[Speaking of foxes...](https://youtu.be/7s_LKdxTDiI?t=54)

If this is recent, this is the time when foxes are looking for dens for their kits. Could be a vixen looking for a nice spot for babies.

You ought to frame that one.
Aww. No bugs crawling on her up there. üß∏
Reminds me of the time I heard a bunch of newspapers were stolen in a small town, and a vixen was to blame.
