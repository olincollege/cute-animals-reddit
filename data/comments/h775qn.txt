She's so fluffy. What's it like being flopped on by a cat cloud?
Oh man, look at how lovey dovey she looks at you, so cute
The funniest part is how straight up pissed off you look every time, knowing full well you love her to bits.
How can you not smile at her precious face every time?? I love her
Her 2 feet‚Äôs stretched in the air, is adorable
My man! You're digging those diamond patterned shorts eh.
[Relevant: The last time I saw us on the Frontpage.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/eq4asy/guy_recorded_all_the_arm_flops_his_cat_made_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Video from 2015.
Ok she loves you a LOT

Omg the part with the r/straightenedfeetsies
Fuck I miss my cat.
Aww
Omg it's you! I want you to know I took inspiration from your last gif and taught my cat to do this. He's a fluffy kind of cat too and likes being held on his back. He likes to lay on my chest when I go to bed but it gets really annoying since I can't move. So one night I put my arm out to catch him in and pushed his butt to that side and he just kinda fell into it. It was awesome!

He's still learning but sometimes he'll lay down horizontally across me and then try to flop but not go anywhere, so he stands up and turns around and tries again. He might have some wires crossed.
What a precious bb
Ahh the way she stares. Divine love.
My human is known for playing videogames, so I recorded some footage of it for you all.
Dude, treat your hands and buy a Pro Controller
r/petthedamncat Such a cutie tho!
What kind of kitty is this?
What games are you playing on switch?
Where‚Äôd you get the diamond shorts?
Foofy flops!  She's adorable!
mine does this as well üòª
So precious!
Floofy
...More.
Omg she loves you so much!!!!
She loves her dad!
How can you witness such awesome cat cuteness and have zero facial expression?!
What breed is she
Whatever the male version of resting bitch face is, you have it
How does that man not smile ONCE?
r/PetTheDamnCat
That BIG STRETCH in your right arm was flipping adorable.
It's Nala, the snow loving cat!! The original version is one my favorite videos. Thanks for uploading more. She's so precious! üòª
Ugh adorableness overload!
How can you wear the same pants all the time?
How did this cat get fluffier with each flop??
It‚Äôs Nala!! @living_with_nala on insta. She‚Äôs a real floofin cutie!
Cats like that cure depression
Growing up with three cats, I never knew I was allergic to them until I moved out.

It's one of the saddest things to me because I really am a cat person, but my allergies go crazy. And my health is very piss poor in other ways that already medicine is out of the question.

Maybe one day üòü. My wife and I miss an animal companion so much
Just lost my flopper today. Hug yours tight for me.
2/4 of my cats do that :D
The best player 2
A PS4 and a Switch. Good choices.
The little paw-shake she did to untangle it was so cute
my dog loves to sit like this, but sometimes he'll lay with his head facing me and his belly against my side/arm. It makes it so hard to game when he does it but im not enough of a monster to move him just so I can comfortably play
So cute! (And OP himself is just as cute)
Doodle is a more content rhyme.
Why do you look so depressed and pissed lol
Hey man, love the cat gif. 

My 7 year old died to a predator last night. It's crazy how much you miss them when they're gone. Go ahead and give some extra snuggles to your cat from a reddit stranger tonight.
No title has ever before made me look at a profile so fast
I remember the other video! You guys are so cute.
Magnificent floof! Love the tail :)
She's so fluffy!
This so one of the sweetest things I‚Äôve ever seen! Thanks for posting!!
Nice house-shorts
Thank you for sharing!  I love this!  My cat loves me and gives me wet nose kisses and head bonks.  Even reaches up and will pat my face .  But has never done the arm flops.  I'm jealous  !  üòÅüëç
Ive never seen someone so angry to cuddle their kitty, lol
is she a norwegian forest cat?
Hi Nala
Wow, such a sweet and beautiful cat! This also looks like a ‚Äúnotice me, human‚Äù compilation.
Does anyone know the breed?
I want a cat just like that. What's the breed?
I feel like I have seen this before
Legend says that to this day, he is still playing Nintendo switch
My favorite is when her claw gets stuck on your shirt. She's adorable, what a loving kitty. Aren't they the best? I have a ragdoll and he flops like this too, what a treat.
Nala! I knew this was her from the moment the video started. Love her instagram!
Breed?
What breed is it?
It's Nala! One is my favorite YouTube cats. I also like the video where she pops up from the door. üòª
How Dyou teach a cat to be this lovey? My dads cat hates people. :(
She‚Äôs so cute! What breed is she?
That is so sweet. We just lost our cat, Don Fanucci, to an accident yesterday. He was tussling with another cat across the street from our house, disengaged and start to sprint across the back to our house when the car hit him. He tried to get up, but was gone within 30 seconds. I saw all of it...the shock phase wore off but now am in a stage or melancholy and sadness. He acted just like this cat (when the dog wasn't around). Just a sweet, sweet boy.
Non-cat people who don‚Äôt get why people like cats need to watch this
I love the controller face rub, my cat does that all the time haha
Nala!! I follow her IG. Love these videos.
This honest to gods looks so fucking comfy. I wish i had a cat
She's  beautiful, I like her little feety stretches
Unrelated but you look better with long hair as opposed to the close cropped.
Bro I‚Äôm orod if you.  Around 3 am my cat will decide my lap is the place to be as I‚Äôm actively in an online comp.  I love it.  I‚Äôll make sure she‚Äôs good before cont to game.  Then she leaves me furry and hairs everywhere
Cute rug with paws
I remember you! You guys are adorable!!
This is so wholesome I can't even
This is why I‚Äôm a cat person
YES my cat does that too! He just always assumes I‚Äôm going to catch him (he‚Äôs right), but it makes my heart so happy that he trusts me every time ü•∫
He‚Äôs so fluffy. 

( I meant the cat if that wasn‚Äôt obvious)
The flop paired with rigor mortis legs are the best!! What a sweet girl. Is the belly for show, or does she let you pet it?
/u/vredditshare
I hate being allergic to cats :(
You may have just cured my depression, thank you
I'm going to need you to keep providing a steady supply of these floof flops. So damn cute.
It's not really the arm flop so much as an entire body flop.
Lucky human!
0:35 "look at my butthole! look at it!"
Gotta make sure she's supported and is comfortable!
I am so freaking envious you have no idea.
My cat likes to lay the exact same way!
Enjoy those times.
My cat does the exact same thing. It's so freaking adorable
Daddy, i just trying to keep you busy..
I love this and both of you.
It fits, it sits.
Oh to be a kitteh, flopping down on his favorite person, no cares anymore in the world
Those little leg stretches ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
How about you give the cat attention and not your damn consoles?
This looks so much like my cat
Those diamond pattern shorts appear to be a favorite
This cat üòç she's beautiful, and quite clearly loves you so much
I love how her back legs stick straight out lol
Great video, just brings joy; and what a beautiful poem. Congrats to both
Despite his stoic and stern expression I know that man loves his cat more than anything in the world
this is so cute... and way easier to deal with than my cat, who likes to blind and suffocate me
This dude been laying on his couch playing video games for a decade
Who the actual heck uses the joy con grip
I‚Äôve watched this so many times, she‚Äôs so cute! The way she looks at you, she loves you so much! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I know this cat, nala!!!
My mom showed it to me. XD
How the hell can you not smile at her??
Maine Coon right?  Never met a cat of that breed that wasn‚Äôt full of personality.
Aw I love Nala! ü•∞ü•∞
This is why I'm here.
Your cat is so damn cute I want to borrow her just for a day.. I need this cat in my life
hey i remember you. this is just as cute as last time
My house mate has a Rag doll cat and it has the most violent cat flops I've ever seen. It's almost like she jumps before flopping.
The video of your kitty doing this from a few years ago is one of my fave kitty vids of all time. I got my first ever cat just a few months ago, but unfortunately he won't do an arm flop lol.
Hey hey hey warning here, your cat is too cute, please hide it.
How do I get this cat and not Claws McBackshredder
Why does he look so done? He has the god damn cutest kittie of the universe in his arms, but he still looks like he got hit by some...random blue turtle
I‚Äôm more distracted by his questionable taste in shorts attire
Nice to see you on the front page with Nala again!
my cat is also never satisfied with just laying on my lap, he must be cradled in my arms like a baby
My cat is known for making my arm go to sleep.
So sweet. But also, you must have fur everywhere!
Buy some more shorts
Watching this just made me miss my two fluffs.
I know a doppelg√§nger of this dude
The last clip, that little tushy!! i'm melting
Ugh. My boy used to do that.  Please enjoy and love every second of your snuggles. :)
She is so smol! I love her!! Especially when she stretches out her lil peets. When my big ass boye does this he takes up my whole arm from shoulder to wrist (if he doesn't stretch out) and I'm 5'8" lol
That is a very soft-looking cat
oh wow i love this so much!!
More of this cuteness plz!
Fuckin CLASSIC cat
i let out an audible sound when she slid onto the sofa, my heart!
omg i absolutely love her
Cute cat. You need to get out of the house. Lol
What game are you guys playing?
This is happiness for years
What a beauty. Is she a ragdoll?
Sorry guys cant play anymore my cat needs my attention
F L O O F
10/10 floofi flops
 Aww. Kitter cat.
Get yourself a pro controller mate, it's worth it.
Thank you for this
Fricking adorable. What breed? This cat made me explode mentally with adoration, and a "haha liars". the "haha liars" to my mom and dad and little sis who say cats are not loyal. I've showed it to them, they like it. Take my upvote. and have a good day.
My cat does the same! And she‚Äôs just as fluffy, is she a RagDoll breed? They are so very floppy and sweet :)
Cute.  On a side note, a pair of your shorts matches my couch fabric.
She is too cute!
i am so fucking jealous. my kitties don't give me snuggles.
How can you not smile when you look at that floofy bundle of adorableness?
hey op i like that pattern on the shorts, is there somewhere online i can get a pair for myself?
This is the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all day
I enjoy Vadim at the end, you've lost.
Hahahh, the best was at 0:24. All paws in the air!
Your kitty is a doll baby. I loved her back peets stretch. üòç
this is like the movie, Up but with cuter characters
I wish my cat loved me like that lmao üòÇ
I do like the gray shirt the best and do think you need to change your shorts more often.

Oh, the cat flops are cute too.
Did you trade your soul to earn this superpower? I've never been so jealous in my life. SO FREAKIN JEALOUS
My parents Maine coon does this and let me tell ya...its adorable.
Stellar performance!
What an adorable 'lil shit
she‚Äôs beautiful
I've never been much of a cat person. But this makes me want one.
Omg. This kitty gave me the biggest smiles all day.
That couch looks 300% uncomfortable
My cat is the black version of her!
She is precious! Looks at you like she is so in love. Beautiful!
I can‚Äôt stop watching lol, so adorable!
i could never play games that way haha. i'd just give up and snuggle the kitty :)
I'm going to steal your cat. Sorry.
That's exactly what my chow chow likes to do
yep. keep em comin‚Äô.
More plz
This is adorable. I also have a big floof that when she flops over her back legs stick out haha
My floofy cat does this but plops down like that from a completely standing position.  Before that she head butts me a bit wanting kisses.
What a cutie!
My cat does the same exact thing. We call it the tuck-n-roll
Moochy cats are the best kind of cats .
She loves you so much!!! This is adorable
I‚Äôll tell you what, while you - and he - are still alive, I will shit on his ‚ÄúHollywood Walk of Fame‚Äù star on your behalf on my next trip to L.A.
This just breaks my heart and puts it back together, too adorable and her face, the way her eyes shine
that fluffy mf.
How about get a life and a job
awwww my fuzzy little girl does this too, although it's on my chest more often than the arm. She has such love. Awwwwww RUB HER BELLY
Love the tufty paws.
what a cute fuzzy baby
She clearly likes it!
She's the cutest fluffy!
Aw
That cat's name is TubberBubber, end of story
My favorite is that one time your arm isn‚Äôt there to catch her and she‚Äôs like ‚Äúwtf mate... oh, ok this is still comfy spot‚Äù
That‚Äôs one cuddly gaming buddy right there
Oh my god, my girl Mufasa does this when she wants her chest rubbed, it's so cute!
Just adorable üòç
The last one where she looks at you and her little paws moved got to me ~aw~
Oh my god this is too adorable
We like that
Love.blue shirt flop ..with all 4 legs in the airüòÖü§©
This man has an xbox, switch and a ps4. Lucky man.
I‚Äôve never seen a cuter couple.
I was having a shit day, and now I‚Äôm not anymore, thanks
You should invest in a Switch Pro Controller
She is such a gorgeous cat! Look at those fuzzy pantaloons and those toe feathers!!! She could fit in two other sub reddits!
Awww, she love Daddy! Our late Gatsby (RIP) used to do that for Daddy. He would hop on Daddy's lap and then do the flop cat into the crook of Daddy's arm.
What you don't realise is that cats aren't doing their job if they aren't getting in your way as much as possibleü•∞
Lol. Do you and the kitty play video games all day?!
She's always looking at you with üíó eyes! So cute!
Ragdolls are the absolute best. We have one who does the same thing. He does it all the time. He has a sixth sense for when I am in zoom meetings and insists on it. 

10/10 would get another. This one adopted us when he was stray though, so we have no clue how to go about getting one any other way.
Many comforts were had
Oh my what a bootiful big bby üò≠
My dog does the same thinh
My cat does the same thing!
I want a cat that loves me that much üò¢
I always hear cats are evil and vindictive. If they get mad at you they will pee in your shoe. But this cat looks all cute and fluffy. Nice kitty
My cat does this too!
It must be nice to have a sweet little darling look up at you with pure love like that.
Can you not tell I want you to pet me? Who trained you?
ü•∫ü•∫ so cute
Im more interested in the hand cramps you must get from using the Joycons like that.

The best part about those is that they are 2 halfs and you can just relax with your arms at your sides with them.
Oh. My. God. What a sweet baby.
Is this cat for sale? I'll buy her for 25 schmeckles!
So cute, lucky to have a cat that loves you that much.
The unhappiest cat owner I‚Äôve ever seen!
Bro how many consoles do you have?
Dude, how did you not smile once?!?
Haha I dated a girl who had a cat like this. 

Poor monkey, I learned about the behavior when he crawled on my chest and flopped over unexpectedly, while my arm was not there to catch him. Monkey just kept rolling off my chest and thudded onto the floor.
Is it a rag doll, I have one an he does the same exact thing
Lol.  This is my daughter at 2am when she won't sleep in her bed.  Gaming is hard when she's wiggly.
Makes me want a cat
Dont ever say all cats r assholes again
Is that a siberian cat?
r/cuddleroll <3
The arm flop/hind leg stretches are the best.
omg so cute.
My cat has recently started lying on my lap for a few minutes at a time, but never closer contact
u/desimert
Pet her god dammit!
"Mom says it's my turn to play with the Switch"
Best fluff ever üíôüíôüíô
THE FLOP HAS RETURNED AND I LOVE IT
Total trust
So friggin cute!!!
wash them shorts
I want this cat!!!! If she goes missing.... it wasn't me, I swear!
My joycons started drifting for that exact reason.
I see you‚Äôre a man of culture as well.

*darts eyes between pet and controller.*
Your kitty near the end is like "Here, look at my butthole".
I would sell the redditor under this post for the chance to pet this cat for 15 seconds.
My Norwegian Forest Cat was like this. Fluff and all. Hubby and I miss that buddy. 

Edit:In case of cat tax. https://imgur.com/gallery/SqLfFz6
So cuuute! I love how pets adapt to their owners - after 10 years my pup is a total cuddlebutt and even sleeps in with me on the weekends.
Very little is better than a cat with a consistent schtick. Awesome cat. Here is my upvote.
Perfect fit
Does it make me weird that I want to kiss those little fluff feet?
Lol
My heart is melting.
My heart is melting.
you are so lucky. My white fluffy Luna will sit on me but it is absolute domination...like she is surveying terrain from my chest like the Sphinx. The slightest nudge or adjust I make and she is off me like, "how dare you!"
That is so cute! She is so cuddly
Little floofster loves yooouuuuu. So cute.
Wait what happened to simba?
Aww she loves her dad
My little boy Boomer does this üòÇ
oh my sweet jesus your cat is so beautiful!!! what breed is she, and do you have issues with hairballs?
What a cutie!
Your cat is the female version of mine. 
https://i.imgur.com/xC4i34T.jpg
I'm genuinely impressed, and a smidge jelly. Got 2 myself, but nowhere near as lovey as your.
Juat how many gamepad do you have... *wrong focus
Don't be so mean, give her a joystick
I too have designated couch shorts
Oh man, those little white mittens and that bushy tail...I'd do anything for that cat. I lost my cat when I was little and I never had another one again. :(
I could probably watch this forever
I just love how you have your spot on the couch. You look in the same position every time. Like you have found your comfy place, and that‚Äôs where your staying. Your cat....adorable. You go human!
My house panther does this, he loves those belly scritches.
My dog is the same, I melt every time
That‚Äôs a dog disguised as a cat
If I wake up and pull the covers over my head to get a little more shut-eye, my female cat (Sara Delaney) will flop on her side against me until I get up.
I miss my cat and his arm flops
She is so beautiful
Awww.... Omg... Its soo cute and lovely.... Cant stop admiring üòçüòò
Omg so fluffy.
And people say cats aren‚Äôt affectionate
Aww, look at that nice, loyal, reliable human the cat has.
Awww she loves you so much
you need to buy a switch pro controller man or at least the adapter to use your dualshock
What's the cats name? I like it. :)
You‚Äôre back!  Keep this going forever.
I really needed this tonight.
I wish my cats cuddled!
Those must be your comfy shorts
Someone start a go-fund-me and get this guy an alternate pair of comfy shorts.
Why you look so angry guy? Everything okay?
this guy knows how to quarantine.
My baby does this too!!
Omg a sequel!!!
Oh my GAH! I want that kitty!!!!!!
FULL adorable
Let the man game in peace!
Too cute!!! Gaaaahh
The way your car looks at you at 0:35 made my heart melt
awwü•∫so cute
That is a very graceful rabbit
Aw! I had a fluffy orange girl that was floppy like that! Always loved those mohawk toes :)
My car does this too. And the hisses if I‚Äôm not stock still the entire time.
Aww she loves her hooman.
My cat Farnsworth looks exactly like yours. Could be twins. He does the SAME THING! He also loves to bury his head into the nook of my arm.
Goddammit. I want that cat.
Bro do you have every console?
If you like the switch, I recommend investing in a pro controller. They don‚Äôt get drift and I‚Äôve had mine with no problems for years.
My dog does something similar where he sits by my feet and looks up at me while throwing his weight backwards onto my legs and slides down onto his back expectantly awaits belly rubs
That's a lonely man
Your cat is adorable! And you're not too bad yourself. Though you remind me of someone but I can't think of who, it's on the tip of my tongue. It's driving me crazy, I'll be back.

EDIT: Richard Harmon! He's on The 100. Shoo I can sleep now
I THINK I‚ÄôM BOUTA STEEEAAL
She really loves you.
My cat does something very similar to this every day when I get up and when I get home from work.
no way is she real. she's like an actual living toy. it's like she's scientifically designed and created to embody maximum cuteness
The simplicity of this brings me immense joy
Poor kitty while you‚Äôre obsessed w gaming
What kind of cat is that? Because I‚Äôll take 5
Your cat is cute
Oooooooooh what kind of kitty is that :D
Still a better love story than Twilight
Mega-goober she is
please trim her claws.  she keeps getting snagged on your shirt
A true joycon boy, i see
Where'd you get those pants?
I just have to say, I am so incredibly jealous of you.  The first cat I bonded with was so amazing, and your video reminds me of our bond.  I love this, and I wish you many years of happiness with your cat.
Those shorts are atrocious üôÉ
Cute cat tho!
What‚Äôs ur favorite switch game?
Quick question. Do you always wear the same shorts?
You sir have a good friend in need
Thankyou for this
Omg the FEETS
Sean Gunn, is that you?
I WISH my cat did that üòç
Dude, the cat is literally begging you to stop playing games and play with him/her.  In actuality, the cat is trying to inconvenience you to focus on him / her.
.
Oh precious girl
People actually use that thing that holds your switch controllers together like that?

One of my favourite parts about them is I can put my arms in any position independently from one another and still play.
Awww what an adorable gaming buddy ü•∞
Mr. Business. Mr. Jim Business.
Mine literally throws himself on his side. Sometimes he throws himself into my face while I'm sleeping.
My cat does the same thing!
it was an X-Box or a cat. i think he chose wisely
Mr. Business!!!
Are those shorts comfortable?
Appreciate it buddy, made my dayü•∫
Youre both so cute.
Her face when she fell right back on the couch instead of arm. Sorry to break it to you but I don't know if any human will ever love you as much as she does.
What breed of cat is that?
What a sweet puffball!
Oh my gosh, my cat looks exactly the same as her but in male :o Same color and fur lenght and same white paws. She‚Äôs adorable! I love grey cats.
awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
She is a treasure.
reminds me of my mama's. I love her
Not enough NEED MORE!
Such a floppy flopper
Aww, she's so snuggly!!!
PS4 and Switch eh? Another man with good taste such as myself
I'm in love with her
She is so cute and snuggly. My cat only came to me when she wanted something from me, usually food.
That cat is very fluffy
So cute!! What game are you playing?
Same shorts, different day.
I can hear her say "why am I here if it's not for your attention?"
Gotta love cat dads
My 75 lb dog lays in me like this.
This cat loves you.
This is so sweet. ‚ù§‚ù§
WHATS HER NAAAAAME?!?!?
I'm jealous of you!
/u/vredditshare
Military I see. I can notice that coyote Brown tee from a mile away.
One of my goals is to have a kitty that loves me like she  loves you! Adorable!üíï
i wish i wasn't allergic to cats :,(
Mine does a similar thing! He loves to climb on you and sleep cradled on his back like a baby. So cute!
that cat is a boss
Man. I never cared much for cats. Until I saw this.
Alexander Skarsgard
I just need to pinch that cats feet‚Äôs pls...
She obviously hates you.
Now that is a FLOOF!
What kinda kitty.
I loooooooooove her
Omg your cat is just like my cat. Same mannerisms, same long hair, white ear tuffs, Norwegian look, but he's all black. He's the most chill cat ever.
Is that a munchkin? My munchkin does the same thing! It‚Äôs so sweet!
What are you playing?
You look like a young Ethan Hawke
Where'd you get the brown, diamond shorts? If anyone knows please reply.
I‚Äôm convinced this for rage was all taken all in the same night with just a T-shirt change...lol
What breed ?
Why do you have 2 PS4 controllers?
Dude loves them diamond shorts.
Those diamond pants look incredibly comfy. Are they comfy?
Whatchu playin my guy?
Damn your shorts are cute.
I'm dying from cuteness right now. The way she tucks her head <3
Flipity flopity, your arm is now my property.
We all dream of cats like this. Also I liked how all 3 major game consoles were represented. Lol
Am I the only one who also paid attention to the loungewear fashion show?
One of life's greatest pleasures is a cat that likes to cuddle.
You love those shorts!!
I would very much like for my next cat to have this feature.
Omg she‚Äôs adorable. She reminds me so much of my old cat Smokey. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I never had a floppy cat until our giant gray Maine Coon, who, aside from the white, looks a ton like yours. Maybe it's genetic lol.
She is like ok this isn't working, I'ma gonna just take my cute little feet and just cover his controller! SHE IS ADORABLE  LOVE FLUFFY üòòüêà
Really sweet!  And those God's eye shorts are Everything!
this is so cute.
I have no idea how people play video games laying down
Omg that cat freaking adores you
Does she ever flop the wrong way and fall off the couch? Cause my kitty does that at least once a week.
Here I was thinking my cat was the only one.
Whatcha listening too?
Aww my big dumb doofus does this too. Kills me every time
My cat does this so often and if it was up to her she'd stay there forever napping and snoring in my ear!!
SO cute!! Is she a ragdoll, by any chance? What an affectionate cat she is. I love that you love on her so much. I see too many people just push away their cat when the cat wants/needs affection. Thanks for posting! üêæ
This man has a favorite pair of shorts...
I‚Äôm jealous of your cat
In love with the little arm movement you do to tuck her in closer :3
I cant wait til my cat gets a little older and fatter. She's about 2 and still a ball of freaking energy.
She clawed your... 
T SHIRT. CUTE.
The fluff!!!
üíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíôüíô
You are so lucky to have such a wonderful floof! What a good floooof
This is why I live reddit... Thank you for this.
Have never been amused by cats. But this video is very satisfying.
Awwwe! She's gorgeous!! I had a diluted tortoise calico Maine coon kitty too!! Your baby looks sooo much like her!  Her name was ClaraBelle and always wanted to be laying on me. She would go on road trips with me and sat on my shoulder until she got too big.  So sweet, they are the best!!
lol why does it amuse me so much that the shorts never change
This is a true love story for our age.
awe my dog does that
How is it that you have both a Nintendo Switch and a PlayStation?
My cat does the same to my husband! But my husband refuses to have his face on Reddit.
Nice jammies dude
So freaking cute!!!!
Omg I love your cat! Such a good gaming buddy!
My cat bites and scratches me when I try to touch it.... Wanna trade? Lmao
protect this mighty floof at all costs! beautiful lady you got there!
Aww, she reminds me of my last cat.
My kitty used to do this!! I miss her so much! My ex got her in the breakup bc she loved his dog. Ugh.
LOVE how your cat does that stretch with their legs! What game for the Switch are you playing?
Awww. She loves you so much.
Dude your cat is cute as fuck.
Is she a Maine Coon?
Someone that actually uses the Joy-Con grip?
I love her so much!! üò≠üò≠
I love it! The feetsies go STRAIGHT OUT
Oh gosh she loooooves you! Adorable
Complete with complementary cat butt ending.
How do you make a cat love you that much? My cat is king of the aloofs.
You look like Kirk from Gilmore girls
My one cat does this as well, but only when I‚Äôm sitting on this one couch we have the exact same way you are haha
Dawwwww ü•∞
That floofy tail is a real Switch game killer.
omg, you two are the cutest!! 10/10 would adopt!! ‚ô•
Dude you are so lucky to have this beautiful fur ball friend that loves you
I have a cat that looks very similar but short haired and he does the same thing except butt towards my face. Kinda wish he would lay head towards me
I also have a kitty that likes to cuddle while I play video games. I understand the struggle/love
Can cats be trained to be cuddle fiends or is this something that depends on their personality?
This is a gorgeous cat
This is an adorable cat.
I don‚Äôt know what IT is, but she‚Äôs got it.
I hate cats. But this one seems pretty cool.
The best kitty
Aww Nala! I'm a fan ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Utterly.
I thought you were a tech youtuber
Best share I‚Äôve been able to provide all day :) xx
Where'd you get those upholstery shorts? They're sweet
She has you fully trained. 
‚ÄúJust stretch out, my human, so that I can use you as a mattress. Pets please.‚Äù
‚ù§Ô∏è
Makes me miss my kitties.  They‚Äôre currently living 340 miles away with my mom. üò≠
Soooooo floofy!
look at those stupid legs
So damn jealous. One day my cat will arm flop. One day.
Let me guess. You are known for your gaming?
She is so ur girl. XD shes precious and I hope she treasures you as much as I think she does :]  <3

What a beautiful cat!!!
She looks like my old kitty. [RIP Grey.](https://i.imgur.com/RykQa4s.jpg)
Her hairy toes
Where can one get those funky pants?
The queen of flop! I‚Äôd die for a cat this cute
***Could You Play Any More Video Games Please?!?!***
I'm so jealous!! My cat barely lets me touch her. I wish she was this affectionate
My black and white cat does the exact same thing, so cute
You play a lot of games.
My god the outstretched feets!!!!! üòª
*everyone liked that*
I‚Äôm crying. 
Do you want to date me? It has absolutely nothing to do with getting close to your cat.
Holy crud. Imma cat.
What Switch game(s) you playin‚Äô?
Omg, I love her.
so so cute cat <3 wish could have one
Omg this is the best
He wants to play
I've been the guy who is gaming and has the pet nonchalantly cuddling up with me, but after such a long time without pets in my life, I would trade any video games for cuddling moments like these
Mr beast?
I love your cat. How much for the cat?
My huge floofer dives on my ankles and slides down my feet, over, and over, and over. I mean I feed him and scratch him and give him catnip and everything. He still does it.
I love how you just floop the booty on up to it's proper position. *Floop*
now i want a cat
Man, I miss my snowshoe. Any time I sat down, she'd flop in my lap.
My childhood cat who recently passed was an arm flopper, none of my other cats appreciate the fine art of an arm quite like he did.
I. Love. Her.
There is something to those PS or X Box controllers because my cat loves to rub against the hand holds of them.
What a sweet cat! My lab mix tries to do this...it's a little painful.
This whole setup looks comfy as hell. The couch to game on...the loving pet ....
Awww! I love her!
Love it. I have two dogs and 4 cats. It‚Äôs a damn zoo but I love those furry little shits.
So cute I can't handle it
Was going to ask if you're single, but you look obviously taken.
r u single?
Can I just have your cat???
My chicken does exactly this lol
I used to hate cats until a girl I dated gave me a 2 week old Turkish angora. Love cats their the best and easy to take care of besides the hair no complaints ü§ü
I absolutely loved it when my cats did this until I had kids. Then my babies did it, then my toddlers did it, now my 6 and 4 y/o do it. Makes me a very happy and content papa.
r/petthedamncat
Reminds me of my cat that lives with my dad. 

Does this every time I go to visit. It melts my heart.
This is the kinda content I need!!
Omfg how precious this is exactly how my boy acts too
Every clip he has same pants :D
Your face just spells "I'm so done with your shit" and "I love you with every fiber of my being" at the same time
I love love love the little butt tuck up so he can grab the controller better hahah
I wish my cat would do this when I lay down in my papasan chair. Instead she digs her claws into my bare thighs and slides down like a slide.
Omgoodness!  She is SO cute!!!  üòªüòªüòª
I want a big fluff ball like that
That is a cat that is very secure in that man's love and patience for it. Lol
My boy does this too. It's the sweetest!
Peter Quinn?
That floofy belly is irresistible!
I've watched this too many times to count! What an adorable little fluff butt!
Play with your joy cons separated. You'll thank me later
I think if more cats did this, you‚Äôd have more cat people
I'm not a cat fan and am highly allergic to them, but I want flop snuggles from this cat!!
I did enjoy it, so much I watched this on a loop more times than I can count.
Great console diversity
CAT: play with me instead
This is something my dog would probably do.
I love it
Awwwhh. This is exactly how one of my boyfriends cats is with me. I love it so much when she does this. It‚Äôs one of those things that you start out being like ‚Äúokay cmon then enough, I‚Äôm doin somethin‚Äù

Then to dropping everything like, 

‚Äúawh damit okay, you‚Äôre too cute‚Äù 

They know what they‚Äôre doing and idc. >.< It‚Äôs such a precious form of affection.
I'm going to comment so I can watch this on days when I need a little sun shine in my life
This is what heaven will be like
Such a sweet kitty. I had a calico that was a master at flopin to my left arm ( just like a real baby/child). I really do miss her
That is love
Men want only one thing and it's fucking beautiful
These are some champion r/cuddleroll
Hope you‚Äôre playing BOTW on that there Switch üòÅ
My boy does this too but he's a 17 pound orange short hair. Him sleeping in my arm is slowly making me buff. 

I like letting him sleep on my left arm to even it out with my right.
Super AWW!!! ü•∞She‚Äôs adorable!!! üòçAnd great looping video! üëçüèª
Interesting
My black and white long haired tuxedo does this too
Hahaha
chonky cat
Is she a munchkin cat? Mine does this a lot!
What a beautiful cat
I can see why you wear those shorts all the time. they are sick
My, goodness! She‚Äôs so smitten with you. How sweet!
Not gonna lie; she has a talent for it.
So cute
I've got a 23 pounder that does that. Almost end up on the floor at times. When he's dead set on getting comfortable ,  not much stands in the way
What an angel
Maine Coons can be major love bugs. She wants his undivided attention, but will settle for laying on her back with him. ‚ù§Ô∏è
This is the cutest thing I have ever seen. God I wish my cat did that.
I have a 115 pound rottweiler that has a habit of doing this when I'm lying down playing a game.
Pet the damn cat
Adorbs!
I LOVE HER
She is soo lovely looking at you.. I think she has really accepted you as important person of her family!!  üå∫
Such a sweet cat!  My cat Elden just lets me pet him like three times and then attacks my hand.   Going tomorrow year 15 and nothing has changed.  üò≠
You're gonna make a great dad one day OP.
"PET MEEEEE!" ü•∫
Awwwww absolutely adorable! I‚Äôm soooo jealous of your kitty cuddles üòçüòç
What a sweet little floofball!
You have the best cat ever
I love how she's goofing around while OP is busy trying to play breath of the wild
That last one:

"Hey Tim, look at my gooch."
She looks so much like my fuzzy pants Max. He crossed the rainbow bridge this past October, I miss him so much.
That is a lovely kitty.  Put the controller down and give pets n scritches.
Are cats do the same thing to my husband when he is playing. It's really cute.
I want this cat! Sooo cute
Ninja? Is that you?
What a fluffy, cuddly baby. Loved the video
Is simba still around?
That cat is 50% floof
How many gaming systems do you own?
can't help but notice, bruh needs to change his bottoms more often
My guy surely you have back and neck problems hahaha
Nah , probably just some guy
I feel that way with my huband, meow!
So jealous. I'm in bed and my cat is laying on my kitchen chair. She will likely wake me up with screaming meows early, only for me to reach out and pet her while she runs away.
She adores you.  Awww indeed. Thanks for posting!
I wish my cat was this smoochy... He just sleeps at my feet
My cat used to do this u til she started chewing on my joysticks of my Xbox controller.
I love your baby
what a good cat
i love your cat.
This is a blessed video. Thank you for posting.
I see. Well, prepare to have more puppies.
u/vredditshare
Nice
You Should interact more Wish to var, it clearly pants to interact With you
OP you need a zabuton on that couch. Maybe a mini zabuton for the cat do she could watch you from the floor.
Lol aww. My cat does the same thing :)
Nerds be like: "This man made it"
Best 45 seconds ever
I don‚Äôt know you but I would die for your cat.
She is so cute ü•∫
My cat learned that I would catch him so he has no sense of self preservation when doing this
His penis is hard lol
she is so cute!
You better treat her like a queen
My cat would rip me to shreds.
Jesus she looks just like my cat growing up, Felix. I miss him üò≠
I don‚Äôt know how you can just sit there and not pet the heck out her every time. She is so fluffy!
Love the back leg stretching at 0:22.
Trust level >9000
Sorry but you look like chandler from friends, but less round
god i fucking love cats
I love little Nala!
let the man play his switch, cat! :)
r/PetTheDamnCat
She's so sweet! She looks at you so adoringly
Nala <3
Much love
So friggin cute
This is really nice, thanks for sharing! Give your cat a little snug from me.
She loves you so much! Very cute
Yo, the cat is cute and all, but does anyone else want to know the games my man is playing?
squish that cat!
Is it the same shorts??
Gorgeous meow-meow. ü•∞
That‚Äôs great as long as you are a console gamer and not a handheld gamer.
Dude, just buy the pro controller! It‚Äôs worth every penny.
The real question is what he was play !?!?
Awe she loves you dearly. Glad you allow her to hang out with you. Father time is a cruel son of a bitch.
Cat: "Human."

Guy: "..."

Cat: "Human!"

Guy: "..."

Cat: "I'm existing and you don't even care."

Guy: (pets cat so it'll sit still)

Cat: "That's better."
Hey, you‚Äôre the guy in the video with the cat sliding down to one side!
I feel like I need to record my cats doing this now.
I stared at this for a solid 15 mins...
More than i usually do on posts.
Thanks
Feels like the cat‚Äôs like *STOP PLAYING AND PAY ATTENTION TO ME DAMIT* and I love it
She looks  hella comfy
So much love
My cat looks the same, does the same but is a boy! Just flops in my arm and passes out
What's her name? üòç
Funniest part about this is how miserable the guy looks! Lmao
You two have got a great thing going! Super cute!
I see a sweet cat, some Joicons, a PS4 Controller in silver and a White X-Box controller.

Nice
How does one get a cat to look so lovingly at them I want to know secrets
Record a video in your underwear anytime my dude. Your thighs look fantastic üëå
Why is your expression like your boss wanted you to record this video?
She's adorable :)
"I'm baby" vibes
