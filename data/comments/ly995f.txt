This is the cutest thing I could possibly see tonight! Now I'm going to bed.

I remember a post recently that spoke about how intelligent they are.
I actually said aww out loud at this. In a pitch that I was surprised by.
Sun conures are adorable but can basically be satan. Do not make the same mistake I did
Palm no harm, only warm.
Now this really did make me say “AWWW”
Why are pet parrots so damn sweet? I've also seen so many videos and gifs that make me amazed to see how much character such a small creature can have.
This is the most adorable thing I’ve seen in a while.
Cute birds but Jesus you are not seeing the half of it. My sister has one and it squawks all day and night at incredibly high pitches. We’re talking, I’m outside across the street and can still hear it clear as day. 

Very territorial. If he doesn’t know you he gets in a mood the minute he sees you and blows out your ear drums. Also quite the biters. To his owner he is a sweetheart though. 

Definitely a ton of work, so something to keep in mind to those that are seriously thinking on bringing one into their home. If you live alone more power to you, but the noise factor is huge and is worth noting to roommates or family.
The bird is the word.
How to Train Your Parrot
My sun conure was an absolute loud, annoying, pest. But she only loved cuddling up with me and hated all the girls I'd bring home as a teenager. RIP Polly, I didn't fully appreciate you but I do think about you often and I cherish that decade we shared pissing each other off.
I had a pet lovebird that did this all the time when I reached out to him. Birds are usually pretty wary, and in fact all animals would be wary when you stick a hand out at them. You always gotta do it real slow, so they don’t peck ya
That's a smart birb.
This really is magical.
"First they're sour, then they're sweet"
This, is the very essence of aww.
My cat does this kind of stuff. Her instinct will kick in and she'll start to bite my hand, then ease up so it's a light chomp, then rub her scent on my hand and ask for belly rubs.
u/savevideo
Such a cutie! Sun Conures are special, aren't they? 🥰
You know it's a genuine "aww" when you don't see the subreddit name and still say "aww"
I have a question I also have a parrot and for some reason it always bites everyone. We have been treating him well. Food and water everyday. And Is allowed out his cage several hours at a time. We play with him with little balls because like I said he bites us alot. How can I teach him to not bite us
Sun conures are the loudest things known to man. My girlfriend has one and it sounds like a car alarm going off to anyone in a 500 foot radius. 

It's damn cute though...
Sadly this species is now almost extinct in the wild due to people wanting them as a pet. 
I understand that many are now bred in captivity but this is a pet that’s probably best left well alone by the majority of people to protect what few remain in the wild. They also are demanding pets that can live for 30 years.
How to train your parrot
Oh my heart 😍♥️🥺 if that isn't that purest love.
I just gave my free award to an other post, but this post absolutely deserves awards
Screaming rainbow chickens!

Also it's pretty weird how we humans can get animals like that to think "That monster several hundred times my weight? Yeah I'm gonna snuggle right into its paws that could effortlessly crush me out of existence!"
That is beautiful.

Edit: thanks everyone for answering. I'm not getting a bird, too much of a risk.
Omggggg 😱😍
How long did it take you to establish this level of trust?
The more videos I see of these birds (or this entire family of birds rather) the more I fall in love with them.
Aww what an awesome moment
This made my morning a lot better. Thanks!
What is it with all animals needing head scritchies?

As a man i felt like the biggest tool randomly yelling “AWWWWWW!” at my phone lol
Until he realises his friend keeps him locked in  cage 24 hours a day, away from everyone and everything he was meant to experience. What a great friend!
Sorry to be that guy...but that bird is in extreme distress. Ornithologist here; the only reason agapornis act this way is when they are feeling threatened. If the video continued, he may have continued to “nuzzle” then roll on its side.(we think to simulate demise). This is one of the reasons they became known as “lovebirds”, as it looked like they were trying to seduce their predators. They are known as the “opossum” of the avian world.

OMD that's adorable! I'm not crying. YOU'RE CRYING :P
That’s adorable. I’ll buy 37
Welcome to top of all time
Thank you for sharing. I needed this

This is so fuckin cute
"I'll defeat you, mighty dragon! Actually no, let's cuddle."
Thank you. I definitely needed that smile right now. What a sweet little bird :)
Ops I'm sorry I didn't know that it was you my friend!
Stupid, sexy hand 'cuddles'.
Awwwww, that was so sweet
D’aww
Very cool interaction.
My chihuahua does this too. I hold my phone differently I’m told. Left hand is normal and I type with my thumb but my right hand I use my ring finger and thumb to hold up the phone and pointer finger to type. My dog likes to cup his head into my hand whenever he sees me on the phone because his little head just fits in there.
Makes me want to go to sleep lol
This is so cuuuuute
I want a parrot so bad but I don't think it's fair to the bird considering how long they live.  It spends 40 years attached to me then I pass...gotta be hard on them
Awww, such a pretty bird <3
Oh!  Sawy.  Mmmmhmmm.
Wholesome
I wish my cat would understand this.
I wept.
My bird does this, he also just realized that the bird in the mirror was himself when I took him with me to fix my hair
So sweet. It's like watching a rewind of when a cat gets pet and then bites you.
Holy shit that was cute
I take shelter in here.

I had a sun conure... but he flew out our front door when my mom forgot he was out of his cage while the rest of my family was in another country. :( I miss u mango
This is pure awwww!
My 5 yr old saw this and says "awe! When can we have a pet seagull like that"
If he was living out in his normal habitat he would do that with his friends. A handpalm is his closest alternative.
So wholesome. Witnessing a special bond like this always makes me want to cry 😢♥️😭🥺

I have read that animals can perceive our hands and arms as snakes. It’s roughly the same shape and their instinct kicks in. This is true for cats and I would assume birds too. That’s why you need to be very slow and let the animal sniff you or check you out before you just start petting.
Happy birb.
NOM! ...nom... Niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiice.
My heart dropped when he went it. This is so amazing.
sometimes.......we all just need a (giant) hand......
This brought a smile to my lips and made my heart feel warm and cozy. Thank you OP for this gem. What an adorable little birb.
That looks like maverick, Logan Paul’s old parrot
I love birds, but I know from friends experience that they need a lot of attention, so I wouldn’t get one unless I could reliably work from home. I can’t put my desires over the comfort of an animal, no matter how goddamn cute and fascinating they are.
They always have so much expression in just their eyelids.

Earn their trust, betray them!
I had a conure that looked just like this, he was very affectionate.

This is like when ur dog is biting you and realizes “oh that’s my owner” and starts licking you instead
This is absolutely adorable!
My bird doesn’t know my hand belongs to me I don’t think, every time I pick him up he bits me but he’s just a budgy so no harm is done
I've always thought of parrots as a bit of a wild card. Everything can be fine, you can be their favorite person (or so you think)... but then for whatever reason, the day comes where they think you've wronged them, and its nose piercing time. 

This one seems very cute in the moment though. Lets hope it doesn't know any cuss words.

This brought me to tears. I recently had to rehome my sun conure. Lovely little guy but after 12 years he needed more than I could give him. Only consolation is I found him a new dad who adores him as much as I do.
Oh man, sun conures are ornery little fellas, but they pick one or two people who they deem worthy of being spared their wrath, and they bond *hard*. 

Then they subject said wrath to anyone who makes the mistake of even walking near their special person! (Learned that the hard way- didn’t even know my ear could bleed that much)

There was a parrot like this at my local bird store in Anaheim. It absolutely loved me and every time me and my fiance would come in it would climb onto my shoulder and cuddle up into my neck area or let me pet it like you're doing. 

Any time my fiance would try and pet it it would turn into Linda Blair from the Exorcist lol it hated her for some reason! So my fiance got jealous and banned me from going to the Bird farm by myself lol
