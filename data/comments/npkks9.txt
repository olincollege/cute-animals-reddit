This ended too soon. More please.
I love how she’s straight up reminding him to be gentle. Mama speak is universal!
What is it about this specific part of the action that prompted the person recording to say, “you know what? Let’s cut right here - I think we got it.”
“I made this!”
Aaaargh this video ended waaaay too soon!!! My heart!
Be nice. This is my precious.
Mama cat : You see him ? I made him, i want you to be his godfather. 

Dog : I'll protect and love the precious furball with all my heart.

Mama cat : squishes the kitten
Makes me think of how well our family dogs adapted to my niece and nephew. We were worried they might be rough with them, but the dogs love hanging out with the babies. There are even a few pictures of them snuggled up right against them. Dogs are great.
Haha. The dog looks so confused - like wait a minute - that’s you, but small. But you’re right here??
"Come here, dog. Come here. Sit. Now listen. This. This is mine."
My actual heart actually exploded
I had a poor day today and this helped a lot.
I had a German Shepherd who raised both my kittens. He was SO gentle with them. Especially the female, she was the litter runt and  when I brought her home she was this scraggly sickly looking thing. I had a gate up in the doorway to acclimate them slowly but she just crawled over the gate before I could stop her, walked right up to this 100-lb dog and curled up in his lap. You could practically hear him say “Oh shit this is my life now.”

The funny thing is, everyone was terrified of this dog. They had a petition going at the dog park trying to ban us, mostly because my dog was just big and didn’t take any shit. But he was bred to be a K-9 attack dog. Once on my uncle’s farm I had to stop him from taking on a bull in its own pen. But this tiny little half-sized kitten just walked up to him, completely dominated him and ruled the house. 

He passed away a year ago sadly. The cats still perk up when they see a big dog outside. The cats are all grown up but you can tell in all their behaviors they were raised by a dog.
see here son

this is your father
This has "meet my new boyfriend, he's trying to be your step dad" vibes 🤣
She’s like , now you must be very gentle with her…I know you can get very excited…so remember, she’s tiny.
Cat: "this is your new baby"
Dog: "oh my god she has my eyes"
She was still being a bit cautious by putting her paw in front of the pooch’s mouth for a second
He licked his lips at the end...
Dog: lil furball needs a big  pawtec
Holy fuck I needed this today
Hey a female orange cat? You don't see that very often. Cool!

Edit: not red, orange
Dog: Mmmm

Cat: Dis not food!

When cats and dogs paw at you that’s a sign of affection. There’s a lot going on in this moment. She’s letting him know that she loves them both.
This is the most precious *goddamn* thing I have ever seen

Dog now has child support pawments.
I like this video but it does look like the way someone's mom would introduce her new boyfriend to her kids.
can't wait to sort by controversial
"Doug, meet your son!"
"I don't know, he doesn't look much like me..."
"What are you implying!?"
And this is the story of how I met your moth... wait we aren’t supposed to tell him that?!!
I have a pitbull the same shape and size of the good boi in this video.  I am pretty sure his first thought would be, "What is this small and nice smelling snack?"  He would be in need of similar mama cat guidance and authority.
Conversation not heard here: “are you sure it’s mine? All we did is rub noses and nap together spooning!”   “Yes of course it’s yours, would I lie to you?  now shoosh and start taking care of your new baby with me”
I love these interactions, gives us hope!
"Whiskers, this is Rover. I know no one can replace your daddy, Sir Meowingtons III, but what Rover and I have is special and we love each other. You'll still be able to visit your daddy on the weekends at the Cateaux du Meowington."
Holy shit this is adorable.
Aww! The baby! 💕
"Dis my bb"
Just so cute.
"now, I just need you to babysit for a'little bit" " I'll be back soon"
This is your father
Paw my gosh <3
Love this!
The cat calms the dog and comforts it’s kitten. Very good momma.
So sweet.

I want the whole video
Has to be the cutest thing I've seen yet.
Restores my faith in ~~human~~  animal kind.
WHY DOESN’T THIS FOOTAGE LAST FOR 20 MINUTES?
“Come look, see I made dis”
Momma kitty- Meet my baby. They are now part of the family. I hope you will love my baby just as much as I love you and you love me. I trust you with baby.

Pupper- Awww. Welcome to the family little one. Momma kitty your baby is very adorable. I love them. Thank you for trusting me with the little one. I will protect, love, care for and teach this cutie. They are my family now.

Cat: Hello yes I would like to introduce you to this adorable creature I made. 
Dog: what is this thing
Did anyone notice the dog lick his lips at the end? haha.

Just got out of the hospital for suicide attempt. This is the first thing I see.

Worth it.
"Take a small bite. Just bite the corner, like this. Gentle..."

Love how she pulled the puppers face back “just a little” and then gently ran her paw along the kitten: it was like a “Hey, back up, be gentle. I made this. Don’t be your normal rough self” beautiful.

I read “edgy” friend and I was kind of confused.
Aren’t orange females rare?
Awkward couple ..

Daddy's gone, guess who's paying for child support

*honey this is your new step daddy*
Omg thats really what it is, wow.
Reminds me of my precious little boy I just lost. Icarus was a cat magnet, and just the sweetest boy. When my ex brought a little Siamese kitten, my boy had that same look on his face. Went to the bathroom in the middle of the night, and discovered that icarus was laying on the floor next to his bed, because that little kitten decided that he wanted to cuddle up with him. Cutest thing I saw in years. Still makes me cry over Icarus’s leaving.
This kinda looks like a single mother trying to introduce her 4 year old kid to her boyfriend.
“He is your father.”
This gave me anxiety. One bite and that kitten would be gone.
Step dad
This was so precious! What a smart mommy cat.
step-dog :)
Looks like the dog is the new step dad and is meeting with the small kid for first time
Okay I am officially dead of cute
Super aawwh 🥺🥰
Omg she’s making sure everyone takes it easy! Omg amazing!!!!
My kitten however licks my face randomly in the middle of the night while I'm fast asleep.
Mom's like 'ok, back up a bit...' at first.
"This is my baby. Look at my baby."   
"...only look."
They had a surrogate father
No he is the father
Dog licking is a good think right?
Plot twist: He’s the dad!
Her behavior towards the dog is similar to how female lions behave when introducing their cubs to the father: being affectionate towards him to induce him being affectionate aswell.
That cat has the kindest looking facial expression I’ve ever seen on a cat.
Definitely need more of this.. 😢 so cute
I love how she kissed the dog like saying ‘be sweet, it’s just a babby’
Video is too short ...why didn’t you film more ?
ITT: a bunch of unoriginal preteens making the same "pitbull ate the kitten" joke over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over....
That's awesome
Are you sure doggo is not the father?
"This me, but smol"
Daily dose of feel good❤❤❤
Aweee that’s so sweet
The fact that this dog is a pitt warms my heart. Pitts need a whole lot more positive press like this. What a great dog! 💕
"Is this my daddy? Wait, How!?"
Look honey. It's mommy's friend. He's going to be your new daddy.
Baby Fuzzbucket, come here and meet your father.

This feels the same way an adopted daughter would tell her father when she has a baby.

" Look what I made papa "
Their love also teach us to stay and live together they are different species but their love is like they are one , But we humans are destroying the nature to show the power, its sad.

True love, pets are so intelligent, so is the whole life around us. Respect it.
Kinda related to this, but we had a dog named Clementine who had puppies. Unfortunately every one of them ended up dying due to some sort of genetic disease. We could tell that she was heartbroken from the experience, and would regularly take my black and white stuffed animals to my closet or bed and try to get them to nurse on her. 

My mom and I decided to look for puppies that needed fostering in any nearby shelters. Every one that we called that was near to us didn’t have puppies for her to foster, but had kittens instead. We decided to try and see if she would take in the kittens, and thankfully she did. From what I remember she fostered around 4 to 5 kittens, and was a great mother to them. It was a really unique experience that I’m glad I got to share with her while she was still around.
