And then he doesn’t shut it behind him, like he’s trying to air condition the whole neighborhood.
This is Phoenix, my boss’ 17-18 year old sulcatta tortoise. He gets taken for walks on the regular. You can tell by his command presence that he’s the alpha of the pack. 

Thanks for all the awards! Didn’t expect this to blow up.
How old is he? What do you feed him? So cool!!!!!!
The party don't start till I walk in
Fuq this door, I’m a dinosaur.
That is not what I expected to walk through that door.

Edit: I’m dead at all of these comments. 💀
I didn't quite see the Boston and thought it was a rabbit. My first thought was "what kind of Dr Dolittle bullshit is this?"
This is quite the assortment of pets.
The way it just saunters in
A friend had two cicada tortoises.  They lived in a shed in the back yard.  Around sunset the male would send the female to the house and she would use her shell to knock on the back door until a human would come out and escort her to the shed and close the shed door.

The male hated pots.  For mothers day they got mom a bunch of ceramic pots with flowers and the male rammed the shit out of the pots until they were all broken.

The also took craps larger than a dog and would hump often.  While humping they'd make really loud moaning sounds.

When they moved I almost took the pair.  Glad I didn't, they'd outlive my grandchildren, and I've moved too.  I hope they're doing well where ever they are.

  
Edit:  They weren't cicadas, they were Sulcatas.  Also the dogs stayed the hell away.
That's a weird looking dog
Looks like some damn good boys to me.
The funny thing is they all run up to the door then they probably have to wait 30 minutes for the tortoise to get there
This live action remake of the secret life of pets looks pretty good.
Dudes been around for a minute probably has a 401k he cashed in on and collecting SS. He may have multiple properties. Also check out his book "Shelling Real estate for a profit" on Amazon.
WHERE IS THE RENT,
I MUST HAVE THE RENT!
DOLLARS, DIME AND NICKLES;
I NEED THEM ALL RIGHT NOW!
i love this because the tortoise looks so wizened and is aware there are other animals behind it but it's just like, "eff you kids i'll go as slow as i want" just like old people in the grocery store.
As a turtle owner, I have to give you my upvote! So cute! What a smart tortoise!
Open the door, get on the floor

Everyone walk the dinosaur!
How TF can desert tortoises learn how to use a sliding door, but not dogs?  I knew someone who’s tortoise would do the same thing.
We still don’t know who let the dogs out but we know who let them in!
Bruh hes older than the house lmao he can do whatever tf he wants
Mrarrr allthis fuggin rap music... open.  OPEN.  Gonwatch the gameFUCK kid watch out jesusfugginchrist imcominthru ugh all these fuggin bigrats. betterbe beerinthefridge
That caption 😂
When you’re 120 years old, you do what you want
Why is he so strong, this concerns me...
Just like my wife's boyfriend, he even brought his dogs with him!
I'm glad my big guy hasn't figured out how to open our door yet.
Turtle flippers are surprisingly strong for how floppy-weak they look
Michaelangelo here inviting all his friends over and shit. Disrespectful motherfucker doesn't even shut the door. 

Didn't get it on vid, but the slow sonofabitch made a beeline for my fridge.
Armored dino dog doesn't care about your energy bill. Him and the boys want inside.
The whole squad coming through 😎
"Come on fluffy tortoises, I've opened the door!"

"Heck, the tank dog opened the door for us!"
/r/unexpected
This is so awesome!!
I love him and i want him
DAMN! That’s a healthy fucking tortoise
You my friend, have made my day that much brighter
White dog is like “hurry up, gramps!”
Letting the dogs in.
>HOLY CRAP WILL YOU JUST HURRY UP.

-The doggo squad
Based on the title of the post I thought for sure it would be a cat opening the door, not a damn turtle 🤣

Also this is like the opening credits of Hey Arnold! Except the animals are entering instead of exiting the house.
Me and the boys randomly showing on up on beer pong night.
Cutest no-knock raid ever.
Bitch, where's my money at!
Secret Life of Pets!
Dogs are like "Let's go, walking rock is letting us in"
WE FOUND WHO LET THE DOGS OUT!
I am in turtle awe of his skills
CLOSE THE DAMN DOOR!
Master Oogway 🙏
I love picturing him as the God Father and all the dogs have Italian-american accents
I aspire to have this level of assertiveness when asking for service in a restaurant.
Mitch! Is that you?
That's a wierd dog.
If this guy were mine I would strap a Bluetooth speaker to him and play shit like flight of the valkyries all day as he walked around.
And of course he shows up with all of his hood-rat friends that freeload too.
Man that thing is strong
The dogz probably love the shit outta him like, "YES, hes opening the door!!!"
That's because this has always been his house
I love how they all wait for him to go through first
Now this is a heist movie I wanna see. Fuggin turtle leading his gang of dog homies to clean out the local casino.
Who let the dogs out? 

The turtle apparently
Well, at least we know who let the dogs IN.
That's a weird dog
The title is *mwuah*
Lol that dog is so cute 🥰
Dr. Doolittle is going to be so pissed when he gets home.
I hope you know that dinosaur.
quick! somebody call the baha men! we might have just found out who actually did let the dogs out (and in!).
That lab is so polite.  Waiting for the bad ass to make his entrance first.
the pug hop is maybe my favorite part lol. it waited for so long to make a tiny jump
Rock doggie!!  Lawd he comin'!!!

*Very slowly...*
I love how he doesn't give a fuck about the dogs.
I love how the first dog just jumps right over him
Get the spatula and roll that mf over for a minute. That will teach him
The Leader of the Pack! ♥️
Gotta love the pets that outlive us. Good on him
His dogs just helping him with that boss walk
But he's leaving doors open like someone else payin the utilities lmao
Why is that dog so slow?
I like how the last two dogs was like, “Shit we’re are behind him…AGAIN!!!”
"I don't smell no dinner, you best get to cookin now"
Those flippers be useful.
Lol and the dogs much appreciate it
I was NOT expecting a god damn turtle.  Maybe a dog or even a bear... but I shocked at the first sight of turtle... or tortoise.
“Dudes come on! The rock with legs opened the door for us again!”
[deleted]
***Who let the Dogs In?***
What kind of dog is that
I love how the dogs defer to the tortoise. Like they don't try to jump over it or anything, they just patiently wait their turn.
I love him. Such a clever boy ☺️
Now I understand why the turtle won the race. The finishing line was a door. Makes sense.
Ninja turtle right there 😂
This comment section had me wheezing
Of all the things I expected, that wasn’t it.
Who lives there?? Dr. Dolittle??
Seems like this indicates pretty high intelligence for a reptile
He's going to out live you..
Did he take the dogs for a nice long walk
Dogs and tortoises huh? New fav combo
I can just imagine the dogs waiting in uncontainable excitement as the turtle slowly walks towards the door to open it
Is no one else going to comment on the slapstick of all the other animals queuing up?
A tortoise and three dogs walk into a house…
What kind of dog is this?
I was here before you and your house, and I'll be here hundreds of years after you and your house.

.Bitch.
I like how the first dog is like "Oh hellllll no, I ain't waiting for Larry to go through, I've gotta get my spot on the couch! "
Looks like a gang that just got back from robing the neighbours
Why are we ignoring how he opened that door with such swagger
Grandpa arriving after taking his grandchildren to the park energy
This is real life Secret Life of Pets
"How the hell did you dogs learn to open the door?!"

"Our reptile mate tortoise how to do it."
How can you complain about that cute lil' doortois.
Do they all live there at least?
Second dog : I will wait for my friend before I go.
I WANT MORE OF THIS GANG LEADER STUFF!!!! OP Post more stuff
wwheeeeeerree mmaaaaaaa mmoooonnneeeeeeyy
That was not expected.
Where did you get that armored dog?
That frenchie jump!
He's probably old enough that the deed to the land is in his name.
I saw that claw and ai thought it was a pangolin!
That first doggy was so rude, not even a “thank you”
"He's a weird dog, but he opens the door"
Who let the dog in
He clearly has struck a deal with the dogs. He'll  open the door if they keep it chill
Opening the door for the whole Brooklyn Zoo to push on through
Go! Go! Go! The wall has been breached!
It’s nice of the two last dogs to wait for the turtle to pass through
Now that is innovation.
I wish my sliding door opened that easily!
That’s great. Our desert tortoise isn’t big enough to open the door himself, so he just keeps banging against the door until we open it for him.
"Jerry, open the door for us! Jerry, do the thing!"
And not closing the door back up, letting cool air out and bugs in!
He came over with his paht-nahs, "bitch, lemme see my kids!"
Very polite dogs to wait their turn to come inside.
He's clearly in charge of the group, those doggos know what's up
Lol
Is be impressed if he turned around and shut it, because it’s not a good damn petting zoo in here.
So cool!
Blergh!! Let me in mfer!
Follow me bitches! We got a party to get started!
Good thing you have the slow-feeder bowl so he doesn't eat too fast.
And the utility bill.
i can honestly say I was expecting any other animal BUT a turtle ,,,
let me in I'm tryna fuck
"Excuse me, Tortie, would you take the dogs out to the yard and let them back in when they're done?"
Boss moves 💯
How it feels being a teenager with younger siblings.
Your dogs are adorable, although one of them looks a bit weird. Is it an inbreed?
This video has the energy of a hyper kid cutting the line of a sassy elderly in the supermarket.
The dogs waiting patiently are cute
i don't know who let them out, but I know exactly who let them in
How old is this guy
I bet those dogs think he's some sort of wizard, which he probably is
Has a lot of friends.
More like he’s a loan shark collecting overdue mortgage with a gang of lackeys to back him
Okay, I did not see that coming.
Man, I just sold my sulcata yesterday..
Lol what???!  Did not expect the turtle.
He should really get his own house acting like that
Is he the plumber?
Well there's a lot you can learn when you're 350 years old..... With 350 more to go. 

/S
Yes, but WHY did the tortoise open the door?
Your house looks fun!
Tell me his name is Paulie. Paulie may have moved slow, but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody.
You should have HODOR
Wtf is going on here.
The dogs were so patient, such good boys!
Thats the crew right there.
Oh god
This is fabulous beyond words!!! And op's lead-in line is absolutely priceless!!!! Love it, love it, love it 😂
Letting the whole neighborhood in no less! He is out of control!
“Come on guys I have plenty of snacks”
Just like a Disney or Pixar movie.
Who let the dogs in?
Where is this place and how can I be a house guest?
Read through your comments to get the info I was curious about. You’re a good OP.
3 dogs and a tortoise ... wild kingdom
Live look at The Ark
Is your tortoise fucking potty-trained?
r/unexpected
I own this bitch! Get outa my way door!
Godammit! The tortoise let the dogs in, again.
Come friends,  I'll lead you to ac and snax
I agree...get those lazy dogs to pay up!  Turtle got some XBox gaming to get to.
What type of dog is this?
Ace? is that you?
Leader of the pack
*Good Friends*
Is the tortoise the brains or the muscle?
What kind of dog? Looks exactly like my mix.

“Who let the dogs out???”
“The tortoise…”
This person has a great life.
thats a weird looking dog... cute, but weird... what breed is it?
….. good for him.
That's a very strange dog you got there
Well yeah that would be Mr. Slowsky.
Lol
Well now we finally know who let the dogs out!
i want to know what the dogs think
When the dogs go out, they always take tortoise with them because he is the ticket back it.
I like how the whole zoo just came barreling through
r/unexpected
Is that little dog a chug by any chance?  I have one that looks just like it!
Who let the dogs in
Haha wtf the turtle opened the door its so cute
I love this SO MUCH!! ❤
I know he's a tortoise but I'm a turtle mama to 4 turtles and they are smart animals and don't get enough credit!!
The other dogs totally think he’s just another doggo. Heck he probably thinks he’s a doggo
That one friend who has that one special talent
Need a video where they are all going out and it needs play the song "Who let the dogs out"
The Dog had such a Good view of The turtle for a sec
Best caption ever!  lol
GORGEOUS 🥰
I was expecting a bear, at the very least.
The dogs are like Che cazzo.?
What do suppose the dogs thought of that thing the first time the saw it? I know my dog never got used to mine.
WHO LET THE DOGS IN?!
Wait…is he not?
He just finished taking the dogs for a walk cut him some slack it was hard for him to keep up.
DOGS LOVE THIS ONE TRICK
Such polite dogs waiting for that slow bastard except for the first one
r/verysmartturtles
Asking the real question here.

Is that the kind that will outlive its owners?
Respect your elders
At least he opened it, I've heard a determined tortoise will just kool aid man through everything
Yo, that’s a crazy strong turtle! Those doors are heavy when they’re all the way closed. I didn’t think they were that strong.
He coming in all mad like "these damn dogs always wanna race me and it's always a turtle disaster. And of course they win and they're like "hey frank, wanna go to the SHELL Station?" Oh ha. Ha. Ha. And Jim if you ever ask me again why I'm not wearing my turtle neck, I'm gonna round house your ass."
Ace Ventura we meet again
Fucking awesome!
How fast does your turtle grow..  i really want one of those.. what species is it
This is what my dog does, but with the screen door. The screen door has a lower metal frame that he can get a decent purchase on with his nose. The thing doesn't lock and because of the screen door's design, even when it's completely shut, he'll open it whenever he wants and lets in ALL the bugs.
Who let the dogs *in*
that first dog! lol
Whooo let the dogs in! Woof woof woof woof woof
Operation Barbarossa has begun
What would those poor dogs do without the tortoise/turtle (?). Sorry, I should know, I've had both. Anyway.....one smart creature. Sorry to say he/she puts the dogs to shame.
Walked in and demands dinner
I feel like the tortoise’s theme song is bone crusher - never scared
I love him
That thing is exactly like an old annoying person who would move at 1 Step per hour and young people behind them eagerly waiting to move forward.
It was hot outside. 🤷🏻‍♀️
The way the pug pounced in when getting enough room after the turtle LMAO 😭 animals are too much so sweet they waited knowing damn well it was gonna take a few 😂
this is my new favorite
The sass! I love it!
Turt!!
Plot twist: homeowner has no pets.
That’s a strong boy
Well we know who's the leader of the gang now...
That tortoise is remarkably well cared for, look at that shell.
Lol what is this an modern version of the tortoise and the hare ? I was expecting a pig or a chicken at any moment .. like an animal circus at your doorstep .. who’s need Barnum and  Bailey  :)
The quick brown fido jumps over the lazy green txrtle
Can you potty train a tortoise?
Master splinter warned us about this.
Who knew a tortoise could be that intelligent it could figure out how to open a door.  Interesting.   There you go Amazon.  Have an employee shortage?  Problem solved.
Fuck yeah
I love how cheeky some animals are. What a smart guy
What kind of bird is that
But they never ever close the door!  We live in a house, not a barn
Love how the two behind patiently wait for him to get in lol
The way pug jumped like a mfer lol
come on bois, time to part-tey!
I was born before this house existed and I'll be here long after it burns to the ground.  Now open the goddamn door, Carol.
He looks like the "We attack at dawn" kinda turtle lol

&#x200B;

and the dog running in first like LEEEEEWROY MMMMMJENKINS
He looks like he is bitching it was hot outside and the dogs are bitching he is in the way.
that's a weird dog
Woah. Back up. Can we just talk about the pictures of the dogs in the party hats for a second on the wall? Why doesn’t turtle have a party hat?!
Who let the dogs out !
This would be a great youtube channel if they make it one. A gooddamn turtle inviting his dog friends like "come on guys, get inside the house."
After all these years, we finally know who let the dogs out.
LOL
Love how the turtle is in front making the cat and dog wait lol
hahaa the first dog: you too slow excuse me
I clicked on this video thinking "Oh, I wonder if it'll be a dog or a cat. Maybe a deer."
Just curious, is this your pet turtle?  and does he goes on walks with your dogs?
"Lemme in, I gotta shit!"
***click click*** It's just the two tortoises right? You sure the 3rd one's contained?  

Yes. Unless they figured out how to open doors.
strange dog
when you are with your whole squad but all are pushing to open the door and jumped first in
Typical child.


Running in and not shutting the door behind him.
He's really come out of his shell lately.
Respect your elders.
Open the door get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur
Who is the homeowner, Dr dolittle? Pets everywhere
I like the small one that hop
u/hitbitfit
Well, in all honesty- if you continue to take such good care of him- he will out live y’all, so essentially he sort of does own the house, lol. So good to see how good he looks, I know he “appreciates “ it! I have no idea species but given some can end up with your grand or great grand kids…. Never know………….
Yeh bet he comes in demanding food on the table as well
Is that a gopher tortoise?
Lmaoooo he literally opened this like "fine, I'll open the damn door myself" 😭😭💀
🎵”WHO LET THE DOGS IN? Woof, woof woof!”🎵
To be fair, considering he is going to outlive you and not going to move anytime soon, he might as well start being the boss a bit early.
What a squad
I’m coming in.  Get the fuck back.
My mans knows what he wants
How many dogs don’t figure this out, this mother fucker 🤣
Kings don’t pay mortgages.)
Lol of course the golden waits until last to go they're so nice
u/paigesam91
Now we know who let the dogs in at least.
The Tortoise will stay alive to see everyone die around him
This is just perfect
That fucking scoot from the small dog!
When I was a kid, we had 3 tortoises and a border collie that would spend much of the summer months trying to round them up like sheep!
Respect your elders
Might be slow but cleverest one let them all in
I love him
Commmmonnnnnn !!!!! You move SO SLOWWWWWW
"Go ahead, Balthazar, open that door for us!"
Who was the dog that just jumped over the turtle? The others were super respectful in waiting.
Definitely talked into it by the dogs.
How do the dogs behave when the tortoise goes into and out of hibernation?
He earned a nice snack for opening that sliding door. So cute!
“See guys, I told you I knew the way!”
My tortoise does the same dang thing! Scratches up the screen door and let’s in the flies!
The way the dogs just wait their turn!!
Hey Noah,         
Nice sliding glass door on your ark.        
Hope this means the drought is over.
Hm hi we need a series about a turtle and it’s bulldog friend
I want a turtle now
The dogs jump in while they can!!!
Ok that went right r/unexpected
So cute how the lab and boxer wait their turn to come in.
Mine used to do the same thing!
Yeah he's totally the boss and you're living in his house.
He also brought a diverse pack of dogs with him. Look like they know how to party too.
Who let the dogs in? Who, who, who, who?
It's all fun and games until he poops in your house....
Where does he sleep at night, and does he just defecate wherever whenever?
I would love to see this as a animated skit or scene from Zootopia, where the tortoise is a real estate agent giving an open house tour, at the wrong house.
That's a cute dog
That is the cutest thing I have seen on the internet so far.
P.S
I have a tortoise too.
Better than a bear or deer that’s like Kramer from seinfeld
Hes too comfy with it 😂
Nice looking tortoise!  No pyramids on his shell, looks well cared for.
*surprise muthafucka*
we went from "owns the place" to "payin the mortgage" in half a generation.
Is this a scene from the next Ace Ventura movie?
Boss music starts playing
That is a healthy tortoise with minimal pyramiding. What a happy boy.
Can’t wait till my leopard tortoise is that size
That’s weird
He he asserting his dominance in this household
Tortoise looks so done with everybody’s shit. “It’s a hot ass day and I got dogs jumping all over me, under me and around me. Let me the fuck in Margaret. Margaret?? Fuck it, I’ll do it myself..why I gotta do everything around here.”
Were the dogs yours? Or was he starting a party?
Dogs are like "Thanks stompy rock".
Dogs are like let the old ninja turtle do it, what’s going to happen.
Say that in front of his face 😂
Come...on...in...fellas.

Time...to...wreck...up...the...place.
What's wrong with that dog?
u got an entire zoo
“Open this shit! I’m tired!”

What kind of dog is that?
Who let the dogs in….
How long have you had the Turtle, that was CRAZY!!
He can open my door any day
He's the one who says I'm a bad mutha fucka
Plot twist, not a pet.
The doortise opened the tor
Love how it makes 3 dogs come in hahahah
That reminds of my girl (land turtle)
The tortoise is like the little sibling that is made to do the risky stuff.
I want to live there.
That one dog was kind of slow.   Probably best to take it to a vet.
The way the first dog hops over the turtle made me laugh
My grandparents made it easier for their dog to do that himself... Ruhe In Frieden, Bobo.
How do you know how old a turtle is?
The whole gang is behind him cheering him on
Its Morton the mortgage tortoise!
The second and third dogs just kind of waited
We know someone with 3 Great Danes, one can open the sliding door. One day they came home and the sliding door is open. There are two guys sitting on their couch with the dogs sitting right in front of them. Apparently they thought they could rob the house and just close the sliding door so the dogs couldn’t get in.
🤣🤣🤣🤣
Coming collect that money lol
Mf was like, come in guys make yourself at home 😂
Everything is so much smarter than we thought!  (except us)
Honey, I'm home!
You have a turtle that big just roaming the house? N I C E = )
Turtle power! 🐢
We’re not heating the outside close the door
Yo we found Ace Ventura
“Mom! We brought a friend home!”
Totally just made my day! The caption is gold lol

Hilarious!
Our dog has that same blue dog bowl
Love the patient dogs waiting in line behind the turtle 🤣🤣

Is that ace Ventura’s house?
He’s bringing his people into the promised land.  I’m not mad at him.
I love that the pack "alpha" is a tortoise.
Ottoman delivery!
I love how the two last dogs wait for him to be clear before barging past that's sweet
Meanwhile the first one just flipping flies over him
The mortgage but not the heating bill.
Who let the dogs in! Who? Who? Who? Who?
I just love this 😂
What a giga chad
We still don't know who let them out but we now know who let them back in.
Jesus… how many animals live in this house?!

I think they might out number the hoomans!! 🤣
Love the title of this. And what a smart tortoise!
The dogs are like GOD YOURE SLOW IM JUST GONNA JUMP OVER YOU!!
„Muuuuum turty is blocking the door again!“
Tooooooo Funny 😆
im pretty sure this is just a remake of Over The Hedge
Hey Arnold!!
Hahahaha omg so steezy
❤️
Ive never known a tortoise whos not a home body .
This guy has earned my respect.
The great herpetologist, Ditmars, felt that turtles were the smartest of the reptile clan, and said that they were equivalent to rats.   And rats are pretty bright. 

We had a box tortoise that knew it’s food came from the refrigerator, and he’d scratch at the fridge door when he was hungry.
He’s a little slow, but he’s our brother.

Adorable!   So smart!!
The dogs are like "too slow"!
Wow…. My sulcata tortoise spent most of his time trying to eat pictures of dog food from the front of my pups’ chow bag.  Even with a 100+ year lifespan, there’s no way he would ever learn to open a door.
Walk your pond right out of here Bub.
get some wheels and put them on the bottom of its shell then watch the magic happen
He rolls with a deep and diverse crew.
What kind of dog is this?
Yeah but why the whole animal kingdom burst into your home?
He looks annoyed that the door is even closed
Dirty Mike and the boys
Surprise mf!
Your rent is due!
I like how the dogs behind the tortoise are just waiting and not jumping over him. Who knew the cure for the zoomies is a alpha turtle
Lmao i was expecting a kitty or something 😂
Oh Clemenza... My sweet sweet baby boy!
It'll teach that one that jumped over eventually.   Just like it taught the other two waiting their turn.
Dude had to let your doggos in lol
I think some people are forgetting how heavy some sliding doors are. that tortoise is ripped

I bet he dissing everyone and everything, Like a dad when his favorite football team looses.😄
So cute

Thats a weird dog
Dog: “The door stop is walking.”
The two dogs at the end that SPRINT past the tortoise after it FINALLY gets past the doorframe makes me realize that we are all the same when it comes to slow things. When that one slow ass driver finally takes that slow ass turn and you floor it around them.
