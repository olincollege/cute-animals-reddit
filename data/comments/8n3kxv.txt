No will YOU marry ME?
#NO U
That's when you absolutely **know** you're on the same page.  :D
Good thing they both didn't do a Flash Mob proposal, would have been all-out warfare.
eeek \*grabs purse\* oh my gosh \*searches purse for five min\* omg hold on \*dumps everything out\* wait hold on just a sec
Well, that's definitely a "yes!" Congrats to this loving couple. 
She made a... Counter proposal. 
  "When in the universe will there ever be two lesbians that want to propose at the same time, the same day, the same place, and the same way?"  

Well that's at least twice now 
 https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemcneal/double-proposals?utm_term=.buoALro4J#.ravNg4Wwq
Well that answers my question of "which one in a Lesbian relationship proposes?" Turns out the answer is both.

A local event made it to reddit? Nice. This was at the Memphis Zoo, Memphis, TN. This is better than making it to the local news.

I can't believe that woman found something such small in her bag that fast.
I wish I was a cute lesbian
I thought she was getting a camera and was pleasantly surprised!
That's the Memphis Zoo. I remember that from years ago, there's big stone animals outside the gates that you're not allowed to climb on anymore cuz some dummy fell off during one of my field trips
This is deadass what happened to my sister and her GF
So gay. 
They seem so happy. Why on Earth would anyone be opposed to this is beyond my understanding
The damned cutest thing I've seen in a while! If that doesn't warm your heart you probably don't have one. Congrats to them! 
Welp, they're going on Ellen. Hope that's at least $5k apiece. 
r/Memphis
That is hilarious they both anticipated that place for the perfect proposal. It’s meant to be! Only complaint I have is the potato quality tho lol
This is unacceptable by social's standard. 

**SAY NO TO FILMING IN VERTICAL !**

But the couple is lovely <3
So my family goes up to Canada every New Years and my sister said she wanted to propose to her gf and it was a huge Harry Potter themed proposal with maps from Harry Potter and riddles and stuff. So on the day of the proposal my sisters gf tells me she’s gonna propose to her that night and I’m like woah. So that night my sister proposes with her whole thing and it’s really sweet and then my sisters gf says wait I have something aswell runs to the room gets her ring and says here you go I wanted to propose aswell and they exchange rings.  Probably one of my favorite moments if not my favorite moments.
“YOUVE ACTIVATED MY TRAP CARD.”

*searches through purse*
Haha! I proposed to my husband the same day he planned to propose to me - I beat him by a couple of hours. This was adorable ❤️
Will you marry me?

No u
The one on the left looks a little like my ex-wife.  If that's you Wendy, *I fucking knew it.*
Is this the Memphis zoo?
Where are the dogs
S/o to the Memphis zoo 
Another win for Zales..
"You make an interesting proposal, but I have a counter proposal you"
That’s in front of the Memphis zoo!  I was born and raised there.
No, no, no, double proposals cancel each other out. One of them is going to have to do it again now.
Neither of them went to jared.
I felt badly for the girl on the left when the other girl ran away quickly as if she was left without an answer, but the shot of them cracking up as they realized what happened was adorable 
What pixel am i supposed to look at 
This gif is sooooo gay. :-)
"sorts by controversial" 
I’m a rather conservative republican.  One area I’m really liberal on is marriage. I think this is the most beautiful thing!   You know they are both absolutely happy together.   Obviously on the same page, and situations like this I just want people to be happy!   Wake up knowing the person you love is there with you!   Guy or girl, trans, anything.   Just be happy!   Love yourself, and your partner! 


Congrats folks!    
Memphis zoo!! Best zoo in the country not counting a couple other zoos
Now Kith
It’s like Robin proposed to Lily in an alternate r/HIMYM universe. 
I grew up in a very conservative household. I used to cringe at this kind of stuff. Then I realized, who the fuck am i to judge. It’s great to see people happy and in love. This proposal was adorable. Really put a smile on my face after a stressful day. 
I saw you proposal, and I raise you another proposal.
Ah! This is Memphis! Happiness in my city ❤️❤️
For a second i was afraid the lady in red ran off and wasnt gonna come back. Then i saw the camera pan to her frantically searching for a ring too lol :')
Oh shit the memphis zoo. Never thought id see a gif of it here lmao
Hey this is at the Memphis Zoo! We love this place so much, my parents gift us a zoo membership every year for Christmas. I'm looking for the courage to one day work here. 
Memphis zoo!
The absolute best, most wholesome thing I have seen.
this is the ultimate “no u” situation
That made me ridiculously happy.  So cute.
This is lesbos!
That has got to be the cutest thing I’ve seen in... a helluva long time.  It’s warmed the cockles of my black and withered heart.
I'm here for the pretzel necklace.
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
I wish the gif was 5 seconds previous as well. I don't know how the red dress girl didn't see the ring box in the hand. 

Not that it matters at all. They're on the same page which is awesome. But just wondering because it makes me curious.
Disgusting, cant believe the world has come to this.   DONT THEY KNOW HOW DIRTY THAT WALK IS?
Memphis represent!
Oh wow is this Memphis! I love that my home town experienced this wonderful thing
The Memphis zoo!! Wow, finally something from my city.
This is pure and good. Thanks for sharing
If i looked up the definition of heartwarming in the dictionary, I’d expect to see this. You know it’s true love when..
Memphis? No wonder the people in the back look like they’re thinking, “Two girlies proposin’? Y’all need Jesus.”
GAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
This is so gay 😊
[removed]
So, did she say 'yes'?
Where the audio!
This is too cute
Having a shitty night but this just blessed my little heart so much! 
Leading up to this moment each of them so busy being sneaky, that they didn't notice the other being sneaky.
It ends a few seconds too early
That looks like the entrance to the Memphis Zoo. 
Memphis zoo!
wow, I thought that place look familiar. Hello Memphis
r/gifsthatendtoosoon 
A beautiful second date. 
Where are the animals?
And the Memphis Zoo is the best place to do it! Such a happy story!
I can almost hear that 'YOU FUCKING *DIDN'T*'. 
So is this a marriage proposal and a counter-proposal?
I wonder which ring was more expensive
🎶When you try your best, but- succeed🎶
Yaaay! Happy people make me happy
I expected this just to be called adorable because it was two women but honestly that was really fucking cute.
That transition to one knee was super smooth.

Haha funny coincidence! Im sure they also knew eachothers finger size well ;)
When I first heard about this I was like "Wow, that'd been really cool if my wife had proposed to me... I would have gotten a kick out of that and thought she was really... oh they're lesbians... I get it... never mind." 
Every time I see a post like this I always sort by controversial.
That’s my local zoo!
"No u"
I love it! So cute! Love like this makes all the bs in the world worth it. I hope they have a wonderful life together forever!
The double proposal means an instant and emphatic "yes!"

Psychic besties!!  They should be married.

Memphis!  
Finally, I see a post from Memphis that wasn’t a violent crime. 
dude in the back: “ um... this is awkward”
I wish I meant that much to someone... 😢
Congratulations! I hope y’all have an awesome life together. 
Absolutely adorable!
As a conservative, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman because children are best off with both a mother and a father. And marriage creates the stable home for raising children. 

That being said, there are many kids with only one parent or orphans/child protection who need a loving family, and gay people can already adopt/surrogate/etc. And it was straight married couples that **DESTROYED** the stability and longevity of modern marriage. So let them get married, who cares anymore, it’s done. 

The reason this video is r/aww is because she also had a ring. That is unlikely in a straight relationship, so stop being so freakin triggered and just relax and enjoy your life. You can’t be moral *and* a homophobe. There isn’t anything moral about hate. 
Well, these women know for sure their partner is agreeing because they really want to get married! 
What in the fuck is up with these downvotes? Did someone post this into T_D or something? 
How lovely. But why oh why must we endure this decease called gif?
Wtf is it with Reddit and gifs. Post the fucking video. 
I'm so glad the newer generations are (generally) growing up in a society that is welcoming of all couples. It's so much easier to live your life when you don't have to worry about hating things that don't affect you. 
This makes me smile in so many ways... Real love is a true treasure that should be cherished.    The fact they both were on the same mission is extraordinary and well it made me eye leak just a bit :) 
Gay.
Plot twist, she’s been carrying a note with the word “no” written on it inside of a ring box just waiting for the moment. 
MY HEART 
This. 
So they were both ready to propose but one was just a moment quicker. Ain't that donethin'
This made me sooooo happy watching! Wow, what a great moment.
Whoever got the smaller ring is sure gonna feel stupid in that scenario.  
Shit, now THATS gonna last forever
They both got rings? Well one of them is gonna have to go home and change
Hey that's the Memphis Zoo! Congratulations neighbors!!
Hey this is the Memphis zoo
I hope i find love like that one day.
I hate these gifs without volume, we will never know if she said yes
WHOS CHOPPING THE ONIONS
Is this the Memphis zoo??
Daily gay dose (1/1)
The girl in the back seems to think this is cute. As do I.
Oh my god, this is so cute!
C-C-C-CROSS COUNTER!
Don’t leave us hanging! Did she say yes?
That's adorable.
I want the girl on the left's outfit. Absolutely stylin!
My fiancé and I basically did this!

We were on vacation in Myrtle Beach and had planned a romantic walk on the beach the second night into being there. Right at sunset, I was going to propose, and began to prepare by telling my (now) fiancé that I "dropped something". Just as I started she laughed and said, "no babe, first, I need to ask you something," and proposed first. I had nearly the same reaction as the woman with the purse lol
I am the one who proposes
This so cute omg I'm gaying so hard
I haven't cried in like a year, and this made me cry tears of joy today
This is too awesome lol

Man how can you be a homophobe in this situation. This is fucking adorable.
What am I supposed to care more about this proposal just because they aren't heter- ohh that's adorable I feel bad now.
Ah yes the Miss Claridge proposal
Aww, that's the nicest thing I've seen in so long, so good to see people so happy
Gayyy
This is beautiful.
Hey dickheads, IT’S OKAY TO BE GAY, THIS DOESNT AFFECT YOUR LIFE
This is great! I actually enjoyed how sweet this moment was, happy for them both. :)
This is precious. I love it.
I love love. 
I hope to one day have what they have, they look so happy!
Thank you for this,  this is very lovely and makes me realize that it is possible to find the one for you..

This is cute AF. 
The only proposal where both of them get the ring! Congrats

Lez get married!
Even as a straight guy, this is just about the best.... thing.....ever...I mean..... what? I asked *you* first?.... come ON
Adorable 
I wish someone could love me like this.
Other than them being lesbians, which should be irrelevant, why is this here and so upvoted?
How can anyone look at this and hate? 
This is the shit that brings the slightest bit of hope to my cold, dead heart.
That's fucking awesome! How anyone could be against this is unreal. Makes my heart hurt.
Wish my girlfriend would propose to me
That is just too cute for words.
[deleted]
Feels good to live in a time where this would happen 
Whatever you do...DO NOT sort by controversial.
People are downvoting this because it's a lesbian couple? I could care less if you're a straight, gay, or lesbian couple. This is no reason to downvote.

I really loved this, thanks for sharing, OP!

I have never seen a cuter proposal! That is the best version of 'yes' possible <3 :D
yo who cut the onions?
I wish I could upvote this ten times. \<3
That’s adorable
Love conquers all.
Same sync marriage.
This is fucking precious 
I firmly believe that posts on this sub should include at least one animal other than humans.
How sweet
That's beautiful. Congratulations. 
Excuse me while I melt into a puddle. ❤️
Second date? 🤣 Kidding but some of the lesbians out there will laugh. 
Best friends forever, how sweet! God Bless their hearts.
Beautiful ❤️
That's the second time I've seen a gif/video like this. I wonder how common it is for this to happen to gay couples. 
My Mary Poppins bag. 😁
I guess that's a yes then!
The real question is, who had the nicer ring?
Loooool, now explain this to your boyfriend. Rochelle.
Did she say yes?
A proposal in the same place at the same time localized entirely on this street? 
FUCKIN LESBIANS BEIN FUCKIN CUTE
Hey! I know that zoo! It's the Memphis zoo entrance! I've gone in there way too many time and climbed on the animal statues that you're totally not supposed to climb on. Congrats to the happy couple. Don't take small children the Dragon house. They will be disappointed. 
That is adorable 
Aww. They love eachother so much thats lovely.
They look like nice people :)
Funny how most people crying about this just happen to post on TD.
Gaaaayyyy!!!!!
this is strangely like the 3rd lesbain couple proposing to each at the same time ive seen on this sub
Shoutout to the people awkwardly standing in the background the entire time not even considering moving to the side so they're not directly in the middle of the camera shot
Now this is a hilarious quirk I did not see coming with same-sex marriages.
This couldn't make me any happier! I love it.
Les be honest, this was planned!
Noice
That was so adorable. :) :)
So wholesome, so on the same schedule 
That was beyond adorable.  That was beautiful.

Today was a rough day. This makes me feel a little better. 
This is seriously amazing and I gay\-love it so much.
I thought this sub was just for cute animals. Glad to see other awww moments posted and well received. 
I don't think I'll see anything that tops this today, and I've had people sending me pics of their dogs all morning. This is so gorgeous.
This is officially my favorite romantic comedy of all time. 
I think that's a yes. :)
Seems like a yes
"NO. Will YOU marry ME!"

As a straight man I'd love to have this happen to me, this is adorable <3
I’m not crying. You’re crying. 
Wife and I did this to each other. No regrets. :)
On the real tho how do same sex weddings work regarding the wedding party?

Do they both squad up with bridesmaids or one of them picks their best guy friends as groomsmen or what

I want to go to one of these weddings....
God, the one that proposed first is cute
Fuck, I love seeing people this happy. 
This is my favorite thing ever.
Oops I almost just started crying.

Is there a subreddit where i can just look at pictures of cute couples and people in really healthy, happy relationships, as well as post pictures of my own?
At first I thought it was just a normal proposal and I was looking for what was different, but then I realized that both were planning to propose on the same day.
/r/unexpected 
ha cute, they were ready 
memphis zoo is the best place to be proposed to at 
I thought she pulled out a camera at first 
Couple goes to the zoo and both bring a ring to propose. 
Is that at the zoo entrance in Memphis.
No, you.
It’s nice to see love on here. 
Same page? Same page.
This needs to be viewed with sound. It's even better!
Soooo....that’s a yes, I take it?
So much better than that horrid "let's get married" Vegas commercial.
What a coincidence 
Good for them!

Was I the only one hoping she'd pull out a cute, fluffy, chubby kitten?
When you get out-ellened 
If that was a scene from a wacky 1970s network sitcom it might go something like:   “Will you marry my crazy brother who got stuck in Milwaukee and couldn’t be here?”  (Laugh track mania!)

It’s way better today. Congrats. 
I wanna get involved and wait for a follow-up wedding photos ;-)
I swear I've seen this gif with two different woman
Memohis zoo! Great place
There 2 girls.   Its what redit calls
Everything   Cosplay 
So much love😊


This looks awfully like the Memphis Zoo😍
What if the person who originally purposed said no when the other pulled the ring out
There was another post on reddit about a couple that intended to propose to each other. I guess this is the footage. 
So it’s a yes? 
I'll take that as a yes.
Memphis 10 represent!!!!
That's my Memphis zoo
Sort by controversial and then see if you don't consider a voluntary prefrontal lobotomy.
Last time this went viral it was also lesbians. Conclusion: lesbians have superhuman powers of coincidence 
Hello /r/memphis
needs more gif compression
Whoa!!! Yay, Memphis!!!!
What kind of trustworthy city were they in where she just put her bag 8 feet away from her?!
Both said no after when away from the public crowds. 
Not sure if the one in red is wearing a Millennium Item or a giant pretzel...
*sorts by most controversial* 
This is much sweeter than the proposal I saw at this same Zoo during their Christmas Lights last December. 
Hey that's the Memphis Zoo! Love that place!!!
How does this "I was going to propose too!" happen so often?
So, did she say yes?
Sara! Sara lance how could you! I thought I was your one true love.... you have failed this heart 
They both said no.
That reminds me of that modern family episode with the Cam and Mitch. Does anyone have a video of that, I can never find it 
Memphis zoo?
Pretty awesome... Good zoo too
/r/LGBTaww
So who wants the video later when they both compare rings?
So, I guess that's a yes?
I don’t know what could ever top this in terms of straight up fucking adorable 
I feel like this is the one thing same sex couples only have nightmares about. Lmao.
This is the purse she got out of the cabinet from the Chronicles of Narnia. 
Kind of forgot this sub wasn’t just for cute animals but this is very aww

Being a long time Memphian, this is pretty cool seeing this on Reddit

The giddy reaction of jumping up in down in complete and total glee was beyond adorable. Didn’t think it could get any cuter, but them the purse comes out!!!

Guy in the back: “So, is that a yes?”
It's like a much more fun version of "You can't fire me, I quit!"
I’ll be honest when the first girl opened the box and the people in the back walked by with white sneakers I thought a flower popped out of the ring box. 
So... did she say yes?
Hey that’s the Memphis zoo! Who would’ve thought I’d see my city on the front page. 
Well, what did she say?
Awe!!! Weddings at that zoo are the best. Hint hint wink wink. I know that zoo. It's stealing land from the neighboring park. 
Awww that’s so cute
I've never seen Memphis on reddit for something this adorable!!  This made my day.  They are just too cute together.
