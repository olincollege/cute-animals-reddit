This gorilla has more impulse control than I do. Also, it is cute.
But if you wanna throw it on the south-side lawn later, that'd be cool.
What's the literal translation of the sign(s)?
Such a sweet and intelligent gorilla!!!
I just want to be pals with one of these guys. I'm pretty sure I could make an extra large PS4 controller and teach him to play videogames with me.
I read that gorillas that are taught sign language will then teach it to their mate and their children.

I think he's telling them to steal 2nd base.
Did we double check that he's not Andy Serkis?

These animals are so intelligent it breaks my heart every time I see one in a zoo. Koko the gorilla was one of the smartest ever documented. She died at age 46. Koko could comprehend 2000 words and sign over 1000. She would often sign how she wanted a baby but apparently she could not conceive, so her trainer gave her a kitten. The two were inseparable. It was her “baby”. The kitten got out one day and was hit by a car and killed. There is video of her being told and she was so upset and distraught she cried tears and grieved the loss just as you or I would. There is an awesome documentary on Netflix about her life. These animals are amazing. All animals are.
But can he have hugs?
I do this at a buffet after my 3rd plate.
Jesus Christ, protect these things at all cost
He is a fully sentient being. He’s fully capable of understanding cause and effect, rationalizing, reasoning, and the concept of group identity vs the individual. Still, this guy, and similar (especially baboons) are hunted for pleasure, and not necessity. There is a list of how much it costs wealthy Americans to hunt each animal in Africa. I haven unfortunately seen this list, and the apes and primates are at the top.

Edit: Yes let’s change ‘fully’ to ‘highly.’ Sentient seems not to have been the most fitting word. Maybe sapient is closer to the right word. I think a word which means something in-between being able to perceive things, possessing self-awareness/identity, and being capable of asking questions would be a better fit.
I wanna give him some food for being such a good big boy
how fucking dumb and ignorant do you have to be to go and feed the animals at a fucking zoo.
"I still remember what happened to Harambe."
- This Gorilla
Someone buy this dude a gun and a horse
You can tell he’s heartbroken by it too
He knows what happened to the last guy to deal with visitors.
Look at that facial reaction though. The shaking of the head, the downward-curved lips, and the gentle fiddling with its fingers by the pause at the end with that defeated look. Just like how a kid would say "I'm sorry. Mommy told me not to accept food from people I don't know." to a stranger but you know it wants to.

I just want to give it a hug. 😭
I really want to be one of those people that is really close with a single or group of gorrilas.
Spectacular

Does he know what he's doing or is it only a response taught when visitors try to give him food?

I know the idiot throwing food at animals in a zoo doesn't, but how much of a piece of shit would you feel like to be scolded by a zoo animal?  Like a literal primal animal just told you to fuck off by learning your language.
Here's a fact that'll probably get buried:

The scientific name for Western Lowland gorillas is Gorilla gorilla gorilla
we shouldn't be imprisoning these creatures
[deleted]
I wanna learn sign language so I can say I conversed with a gorilla.
Good boy
5 min later,
"Unless it's McDonalds with a large sweet tea."
I took sign language in high school (yes the expert of the Internet comments) but it looks like he says “Can’t have, no, have wrong”. Again could be wrong but the signs are very similar to me. 🤷🏻‍♂️
OMG.  My heart goes out to him.  I hope his existence is filled with joy and love from his keepers who have obviously worked extensively with him.
what an OG gorilla
FWIW my friend worked with that gorilla. His name is JJ. He’s absolutely asking for treats. The head shake is just a gorilla thing.
Breaks my heart an animal that can do this is penned up with people gorping at him all day.
RISE OF THE APES
Oh my god he’s such a good boy he deserves a banana
Sign language - intelligence - emotion - the gorilla I’m sure can’t understand why he’s lives in a jail alone with no interaction - cute? this is disgusting . People think this is quite ok - people are so fucked up
😭❤️how beautiful
When he has his hands together by his belly he looks so damn polite and considerate, it’s too cute
Now I want a gorilla friend
Almost looks like he ate them and then signed
I’m unexpectedly devastated...
Hurts to see this...
That gorilla shows more intelligence than most of my co-workers
He looks like a cool professor who holds class outside
Seems he mentioned it after he ate it  :P
Lawful good Gorilla
He reminds me of Harambe
Never forget, Harambe!!!
I love it so much and I'm so sad I can't share my snacks. I'm sorry gorrilla friend =(
I recently went down an internet rabbit hole of people in the us who vehemently support the right to own exotic pets, in this particular instance, chimpanzees. And I found this whole channel on youtube about a woman who is trying to teach her chimp english and hebrew (literally WHY?) and she keeps him in a room sized pen with a concrete floor and nothing but a single swing for him to fiddle with. If you're interested in getting fucking angry search up Bow the chimpanzee. These are such intelligent creatures, owning them is basically imprisonment.
He looks so adorable. If he wasn't able to pull my limbs from me, I'd try to hug one.
Seen other gorilla's also learn sign language. Always wondered what'd happen if they went back into the wild and taught them all sign language.
What's really amazing is the fact that he also uses facial expressions in his signing which is actually a integral part to sing language.
Does anyone know if the gorilla actually knows what its saying? Or is it more of a teaching a dog a trick type of thing?
I love how he shakes his head no. Like, “no human, can’t be doing that”
Dude that's awesome i honestly had no idea they were capable of that
Animals (especially primates) have no place in an exhibit.
Step 1 sign language. Step 2 world domination.
The Gorilla already communicates better than some of my construction workers.
This gorilla is more intelligent than half the population in Florida
If my dog could sign he would be telling people about how I never feed him and can he have tour food right now please.

Spoiler alert: I do feed him.
“Amy, good gorilla.”
Gorillaz are freaking amazing!

Also, people:  please don't feed animals at a zoo.
I feel like, at this point, we’re getting really close to letting gorillas vote.
Do you want planet of the apes? Because this is how you get planet of the apes. 

For real though, how much do you think that gorilla could bench?
That Gorilla is probably smarter than half the people looking at him.
Well he knows what happens to gorillas when something drops in that doesn't belong.....
He looks so disappointed with people who break the rule
oh my God...
They're evolving
How complex can primates (besides humans) get with their sign language?
[deleted]
What kind of dog is that
I'm pretty sure that Gorilla just said "I'm working"
This gorilla has more common sense than an average person.
This is my favorite animal video ever
One of the best video I've seen on reddit, thank you
That's my bro. 😊
does he understand what hes saying or is he just trained to do that specific set of signs
I'm seeing "can't, me can't" not necessarily anything food specific, unless there's a longer clip...
This is more awe than aww.
I just wanna hug him/her
Lowland gorillas scientific name is gorilla gorilla gorilla. 😶
Incredible this gorilla is recognizing a potential action of a human and communicating a warning to him based on rules he has learned
Oh my God, that's freaking cool, haha. I love it!
What is the extent of sign language gorillas can learn?
Honest ape.
I don’t know sign language, is this a lie?
These animals are SPEAKING to us
Haha, my feed put [these](https://i.imgur.com/1zQOnup.jpg) two posts next to each other and I thought it was funny
oh fuck this makes me scared, are they human beings, oh fuck dude. i know what theyre saying.
>”You can’t feed me guys! Don’t even try it! Not even a little bit!...”. 

>”Ok the keepers saw me say it, wait until they’re not looking and chuck me some of that donut, big man”
when animals are smarter than people...
I just want to hug him but I know I'll be killed.
I'm glad he married the sign language girl 👏👏
The head shake is honestly the cutest thing to me
What a smart animal! I wonder how he actually knows this though. Do the handlers speak with him about it through sign language, or does he just REALLY hate human food?
Isn't it amazing that we humans have taught apes and other primates how to communicate?  I think it is.
My son
Lol but Gorilla dont care what the rules are
He looks like me when I don't want food that's offered to me. I mean the hand movement and expressions.
What if they trained him to do those motions to get more food? So he's trying to tell the zoo guests to throw him more food, but to us he's "using" sign language to tell the guests not to throw more. How do we know his moral values align with ours?
sweet and intelligent gorilla!!!
I guess he got in trouble for that piece of pretzel he got https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/8v9e5o/gorilla_catches_a_pretzel_and_looks_around_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
That’s awesome
So that confirms he has no idea what he's signing.
"Where is Harambe, for id very much like to speak to him"
'No no dude , not in front of them'
Meet me in the back alley.
Brought me to tears.
So this, got me to this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0WsmOhm2Qc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0WsmOhm2Qc)
UH OH STINKY
Why do I want to cry. I need to stop drinking
It's just sad 😒
From what my anthropology told me, the major thing holding back their ability to speak is the position of there larynx in their throat
My god, he's more well trained than everyone I know including me... I'm so ashamed of us now...
I'll be honest, the only real reason I ever wanted to try learning to sign was to talk to apes at the zoo.
so cute

Warren Zevon - Gorilla You're A Desperado
gorillas are so awesome
This isn’t American Sign Language and it doesn’t look like any other countries sign language. Can someone tell me if this is another country’s sign language?
That's a zookeeper going above and beyond to enforce rules.
Oh my God.
How can something be so sad and so adorable at once. I'd toss some fruit regardless, rules be damned
That's totally cool but also kinda sad.  He's like nah those peanuts look good but I just have to munch on this fkn grass.
I'm slowly self teaching ASL.  All I know is that the gorilla signs Stop at the start.
"All Zoo's bad" is such a frustratingly simple viewpoint. Just because it's easy for you to say and sound like you really care for animals doesn't mean it's true.
Harambe would be proud.
What a smart boi
Clearly taught by James Franco meaning only a few years until total ape domination
I'm shook
Such a sweet and adorable gorilla
Gorillas are fucking smart. It wouldn't surprise me if it was possible to fully communicate with them on human level in the future
They apparently can give information but cannot ask.
I like this
Wow
After we humans are gone, I want the gorillas to succeed us. Earth is weary of dominant species. It needs a kind one.
Sad
Awww I love this so much. Generally monkeys and apes freak me tf out. But I loved Koko, and he reminds me of her. ❤️ 

Totally OT but my 12 year old was trying to use sign language the other day, and it brought back memories of learning ASL as a child for my best friend who was partially deaf. I’ve long forgotten most of it, but I think I want to learn again!
Aww what a smart boi!! I wanna feed him
This literally made me say awwww 

 thank you I would give this all my gold if I had it
Or maybe he is saying "nah bro dont cross the fence or i will crush you"
That’s just incredible
That's beautiful!
This shouldn't be here, it should be in r/natureisfuckinglit
Reminds me of seeing your mate through their window as they sign to you 'im not allowed out to play'
Lemme cuddle the big fluff
Uplifting is a tricky and awwfull process.
If you checkout the youtube video he ends up eating the food they throw lol
Gorilla smarter than the fools who can’t read the sign
That is just sad man
"No thanks, I'm good, bro! Nah, I'm good, I'm good."
Still blows my mind that we can teach sign language to girillas.
That's amazing, it's a self correcting, autonomous zoo.
The brains on this 1. Zoo's advocate!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA😁🐒
First time I actually said Aww out loud, in a pub with headphones on, so was prob way louder than I thought lol. He deserves a massive aww though!
"...peanut is good, but I will bash you on the head...you are not supposed to feed me...no no...i bash you on the head"
“MIND YOIUR OWN BUSINESS DENISE!!!

.....see what I mean? It’s everyday with her bullshit.”
What're the chances that it's been trained to ask for food like this? I know tricking the animal would be cruel but I dont think instincts would allow an individual to knowingly reject free food, unless this gorilla can really fathom the danger people may pose on it. If so, that's incredible.
Imagine being deaf, going to the zoo and seeing a gorilla saying he doesn’t want your food.
I fucking love this
I just want to know why he’s being held captive. He clearly has a life to live beyond being just a spectacle.
This is sad.   Tortured animal.
So amazing seeing communication between us and animals. So cool to me
[gorillas are basically people](https://youtu.be/8c0YlhgUNFU)
They’re so smart, it’s amazing to watch
It's amazing how intelligent gorillas are when they can rip your head off.
This is fucking incredible!
Harambee was a nark too
I love him. “As much as I would enjoy a food, I’m not supposed to and we both could get in trouble so I don’t think it’s a good idea.”
What an adorable 300lb mass of muscle.
I saw this is a movie once.  Planet of the something...
They're basically hairy, childish, insanely strong, unpredictable people
Clearly of higher intelligence than the humans coming to gawk, and ignore the signs telling them not to feed the gorilla.
Sometimes it's easy to forget just how smart some primates are. Seeing that gorilla reminds me a lot of a little kid trying to do what his parents told him.
Wait so while he's eating the food they feed him he tells them to not do it again? I love this Gorilla lol
Translation : "Sup bro, do you have a spare cig?"
This is aww but also it makes me very sad that he will be held there untill he dies instead of being in the nature free. I wish people were smarter to ban zoos because animals shouldnt be prisoners.
Welp time to watch the new Apes trilogy again.
Fuck zoos
He’s institutionalized.
What a big beauty.
OMG THIS IS THE GREATEST THING IN THE UNIVERSE!
He keeps saying stop
It's cute AF while being heart breaking.
Did he say that after eating the food?
I've seen the movie Congo before.
Thats why i don't want to visit zoo anymore
I feel sad about...
Freaking ADDDDORRRABBLLEEE 💓💞💗💖💘💕💝
Genuinely surprised that I have yet to see the post that tells me that this is just anthropomorphic projection on our part.

Lol XD
Nice
What a smart dude
If they must have live zoo animals then I think they should be only injured rescued animals with no chance of survival in their natural habitat.
I think he's trying to make the people offering better stuff.

" a banana? I get that s*** all the time! Oh, a Snickers bar chunk that over the fence dude!"
It's so cute to me I can somehow see a little shrug at the end
R/likeus


Woah
If another species can accurately learn and use sign language to communicate with another species, I feel they should not be locked up. They obviously contain a level of sentience about themselves.
Adorable!
I will happily allow him to live in my home
He said, "Dont do it dude... they'll beat the fuck outta me"
Makes me sad that these intelligent, noble beings are held in captivity. I know, I know, most of them are bred there and are an important piece of the puzzle in protecting the species from extinction yada yada. Still makes me sad.
Zoos depress the shit outta me
Holy shit how sad is this? His family killed to the point of extinction, and he's in a prison. Humans really are a fucking virus on this planet
Fuck zoos
someone let me give this boy a hug immediately
Every time I see a video like this, I am reminded of Bill Burr’s gorilla joke.

This is an animal that fully understands what’s going on around it, to the extent that it learned how to communicate and express its thoughts to us using a language system WE designed. And it’s in a cage for our amusement. 

Obviously, compared to the wild, the gorilla is in a far safer and more comfortable environment in a zoo, but I still can’t help but feel that this is at least a little fucked up.
He should be in the wild, how the fuck is it aww? This is sad.
It's too bad such a smart creature is imprisoned by us.
As much as I enjoy some aspects of zoos, this kind of intelligence shouldn't in an exhibit in the first place.
Or, “No, these peanuts don’t give me heartburn.”
You see shit like this and yet there are people who STILL believe we aren't genetically related to these guys.
He could be a weight loss coach. Imagine going for a piece of pie and then his 800 pound self steps out and does that.
I'm not surprise. Apes in general are a lot smarter than a lot realize, IIRC.
We are talking to animals now. This is absolutely insane
He look more civil then human... Wish we learn some humanity from this gorilla and start respecting nature.
While it is cool, he definitely didn't get this idea on his own, like a lot of commenters seem to think. He's obviously been trained to make that sign, whether he understands what they mean or not. Here's a good video which debunks a lot of the misconceptions about human-animal communication https://youtu.be/uYWSXRUGxDQ
How tf is this considered cute. It’s super sad that these animals are held captive outside of their natural habitat just for our enjoyment. Especially when you consider how intelligent they are.
I mean why doesn’t he talk

jk
It's heartbreaking that a gorilla in a cage has to teach a human outside that cage to not feed him. They're both on the wrong side.
He knows what they did to Harambe...
Kinda fucks me up that this is a being that is literally communicating with humans and yet its still in captivity. I feel like if its smart enough to know words, its gotta be smart enough to understand the situation they are in right?
Awwww, look at how smart this animal that we have locked up is.


Anything that can communicate like this should not be kept in captivity for entertainment.
Most inane & pointless comments feed I have ever seen (at the top).  This is an intelligent animal using LANGUAGE that is imprisoned for our enjoyment.  What is wrong with you people.  It should break your heart, BOTH for his imprisonment and loss of safe & peaceful life in his native land.
I appreciate that gorilla's are highly intelligent animals, but nothing about this actually suggests that this gorilla knows what it is signing, or has any idea that is is actually communicating with humans, or that it actually has intent behind the actions. It could simply be repeating a trained behavior.

I'm not saying gorilla's can't communicate this way, but it does seem like a lot is being read into this video which isn't there.

I have a video of my cat giving me a high five - it's cute, but I am 100% certain that my cat has no idea of the meaning behind what it's doing. Apes are capable of more obviously, but they are also capable of dumb mimicry and repetition. Just because an animal is highly intelligent doesn't mean everything it does uses all its faculties.
Ron Magill is the best
such self control.
Incredible
MY MAN! (I miss home)
More like "telling parents to keep their dam kids out of his enclose"
You know you messed up when the gorilla has to tell you, you shouldn’t feed him.
F for Harambe
...and worriedly taps his belly, hoping that the person understood him
What a cutie..
He looks so saaad about it too 💔

The gorilla has more self control than I do. I would have definitely accepted the food.
Aw he looks so sad to have to say that :(
IS THAT ANOTHER HARAMBE?!!
My understanding (and correct me if I’m wrong) is we can teach gorillas many kinds of skills. The thing is they can’t use what they learned to learn new things themselves.
Wow
Not to be dramatic but I'd literally die for him.
Let him out
At the end he says "you're gonna get pow pow!"

Love my cousins
I hate seeing these guys in captivity. I know that many of them may have been rescued and aren’t able to live in the wild anymore, but I just feel such a connection when I look in their eyes... which always seems to have a hint of sadness no matter what faces they’re making. 

Sorry for sounding dramatic😳
It’s a sad world we live in when a 300lbs gorilla has to be taught not to accept candy from strangers.
that's awesome
How much can a gorilla bench? Like a f150?
No, he's saying I prefer craft beer, preferably IPA's. Get your fucking kale out of here. Jk
He looks like he needs a hug
I want to give the good boy snacks :(

Poby the talking gorilla.
awww, she's saying Never forget Harambe
gorillas ain't stupid
They Have Evolved too far
animals became smarter everyday
Oh my god I thought the caption said he's not allowed to  be fed by the zookeepers
Subject Rise of the Planet of Apes has started
I once read a comment asking if gorillas sometimes view humans as a potential mate, like how they would look at their own kind.
Smart enough to communicate... we really have to stop keeping them in cages, we're not that far away from keeping humans in cages at this point.
Imagine being the person who the gorilla talked to
How long before Planet of the Apes becomes reality?
I'm slowly getting the impression the creatures of the planet are doing a far better job of it all.
Magnificent sentient creature. Sad he’s in captivity.
Not cute, the future generations will judge how we treat animals now
He looks sad as fuck when he says they wont let you feed him.
Smartass
This is very cool on many levels. 

Just the amount of sentience and intelligence to arrive at "man, I'd love to...but it's their policy" is mind blowing.
If only Lowland was there to help guide Harambe.
surely   intelligent  and   sweet beast
MAN I love gorillas.
That is amazing, uplifting and heartbreaking all at the same time. 😥
The Ross geller “get fu**ed” sign
Woah
Why even keep these animals in captivity?
Erm is that a guy in a gorilla custom...?
I don’t like zoos
Was he beaten by the zoo keepers to say that?
Feed him anyway hes a good boi
Amy... Good...gorilla...
The gorilla is smarter than the human in this case.
I await the time when other species will also have SSN, house, car etc. After all we share this planet with them.
I think we have to use the intelligence level of this gorilla to the AI system.
If I was there I would try signing back.  How much fun would that be, taking to a gorilla.
Part of this makes me so sad...But I can just tell he is so intelligent. They are amazing creatures.
Is this the same gorilla that was giving a lecture to his class outside? Someone post that pic quick!
This is amazing. So intelligent.
am i only one scared that evolution can just shit on us and monkeys will become as intelligent as us as we teach the animals
ᔕTIᑎKY ᑭOOᑭY
"Don't give me that shit, they're gonna lock me up and fuck me in the ass", is what I'm reading
Wait what?
so freaky that these smart animals are held in captivity for us to be amused by
I wonder if they ever start telling people to feed them. 😭😭😭
Sorry me no allowed feed by you
Smart monkey bro
Reminds me of Planet of the Apes

Reminds me of koko
Because he is on diet, he wants to lose weight for some reason.....

So, is this good enough to keep them out of cages and zoos?
He looks so sad :(
I like zoos, but that's just me being selfish. No animals belong in cages.
Dude should be a bouncer. “Sorry pal, it’s one in, one out.”

I know her sister Lola from accounting....
Wheres joe rogan when you need him
This is the complete and opposite of aww. This tells me this guy should be living life somewhere because it's speaking. That's fucked.
He's definitely more intelligent than at least half the people on this earth
You know, if we can’t get our shit together on fucking up the planet, orangutans and gorillas and octopi won’t be able to move to their next stage of evolution or whatever; and that’s a real bummer.
:(

Seriously, why would a gorilla want to obey this rule of not being able to eat free/easy food? Wouldn’t it WANT to eat food?
isnt it a huge deal we can communicate with an animal like this? imagine if you dog or cat could sign. This is insane.
It looks like a kid refusing something because Mom said they couldn't have it
Throw in your kid if you want the gorilla dead
RIP HARAMBE
What his name??
Awww now I want to learn sign language just to talk back!
He says ,i don't know

How do they even teach sign language to them? Any explanation will be appreciated.

That’s not what he said. He said he had a meeting at the house of evolution.

I really want to feed him now... But I know the rules.
Honesty at its best
I read the title as “lonely” gorilla and it made this clip extra sad
Honesty at its best
These babies don't belong in a zoo for us to go and stare at them or throw them food. 

Annoys me so much when people feed bread to ducks at the pond as well.
This is really cute until they start taking up arms against their oppressors.  That can happen. I saw a documentary on it.

Rise of the Planet of the Apes
angry but strange position...
Some say they are in the early stages of evolution, like we once were before communication and the use of tools. Neanderthals were mentally a lot like this ape. Soon they will discover the ability to use tools, and one day it really will be Planet of the Apes.
It makes me wonder exactly how intelligent they are. Are they aware exactly what it is they're signing or are they simply mimicing actions of the zoo staff
Animals being better than humans, again...
He’s signing “No help Gorilla,” to be specific.
wooww go job
