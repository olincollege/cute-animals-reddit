Happy birthday pretty girl!!! 🥳
Happy Birthday from Germany😉🥳
Please give scritches for me
Today is also my birthday and for the last couple of years, I have really looked forward to seeing all the beautiful pets I share my day with!  I never fail to see a few posts that make me smile!  Thank you for helping me continue my tradition and HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the very best girl!!

Edit: thank you to everyone for the birthday wishes - it’s much appreciated; happy birthday to all my bday buddies, dog and human alike, hope it’s great!; please consider adopting my bday tradition-it has literally never let me down!
That's the most precious face I've seen in a long time.  I hope her birthday is a joy for her, and I hope she sees as many more as are possible.
Happy quinceanera!!
Thank you all for the comments and awards! She is getting all the scritches and belly rubs for sure! ♥ I am fortunate to have her for 15 years and she's been my rock especially during my high school years.  I don't know how much longer she will be with me as her back legs are getting really bad and some other health-related stuff but I intend to try to make the best of it for what is left.

For those asking for the recipe for her bday cake, I used [this one](https://www.browneyedbaker.com/dog-birthday-cake/) and used powdered peanut butter instead and for the frosting is a mix of canned plain pumpkin, plain nonfat Greek yogurt, and powdered peanut butter.  Topped with a crumbled Milkbone and a strawberry.
Happy birthday sweet pupper!
What is the cake made of?
Aw wishing your precious baby girl a wonderful birthday!!! 🥳🎉
Beautiful senior pup.😊♥️😊♥️😊

Amazing! May she have a healthy and happy year ahead!
I'm a simple man. I see an old dog having a birthday with a loving owner, I upvote
Awe. Shit why an I misty eyed? Animals hit something deep in my corrupted soul that is still pure I guess.
I can tell she has made your life better, as you have hers. What a great looking pup!!
Gorgeous!
This is awkward but I think I just fell in love with a 15 year old. Happy Birthday!!!
Happy birthday, sweet girl! 🥰

She’s so happy!! Every time I start to lose faith in the world I see how happy my dog is in it, which makes me realize there’s something he can see that I can’t. I might not always be able to see it too but I trust him, which is enough for me to still believe.
Happy birthday 🐶

I made my rottweiler a cake once. I used cold cuts, with a layer of peanut butter between each slice of meat. Topped off with potted meat, peanut butter and maple syrup as frosting. It lasted exactly 6 seconds.
Happy birthday sweet lady!!! You’re beautiful!!

Happy birthday beautiful!! ❤️
My dogs are still young. Three and one and every time I see a post like this I tear up and have to go hug my dog's extra tight. I know the day will come when I have to say good-bye but right now I'm loving every second with them even when they have a poop accident on the carpet at 1:43 AM which I just got done cleaning up. I love them so much. 

May you and your lovely girl there have the best remaining days together.

Happy birthday beautiful! 🎂
Happy birthday
My dog turned 14 in September. 

We’ve had her ever since she was a tiny puppy, just a few months old. I still remember when she was so tiny that she fit into the palm of my hand. 

These past 1-2 years she’s slowed down a bit and isn’t able to jump on furniture like she used to, but she’s still crazy about food and constantly follows people around hoping they share or accidentally drop crumbs of whatever they’re eating. 

This past summer, she suddenly grew really lethargic and lost all of her appetite, which is incredibly uncommon for her. She lost all vitality and would lifelessly just lay there. She would just unenthusiastically nibble on things she’d usually go crazy for, like boiled chicken, and drink lots of water. 

Something was definitely wrong, so I ended up taking her to the vet, which I admittedly hadn’t done for years. After a series of tests, the vet discovered she had pyometra, an infection in her uterus. This was confirmed with her high WBC count. 

I stupidly neglected to leave her unspayed for years, thinking it wasn’t a huge deal. But the infection she now had required immediate attention and emergency surgery. 

A regular spay/neuter for younger dogs is very safe, but because my dog is older and had fluid in her infected uterus, it was a more risky operation. Also, the operation is a lot more expensive. 

It really hurt that I had to think about whether possibly extending my dog’s life was worth the financial cost. This was right in the middle of the pandemic, where I had concerns about job security and whether I could afford the emergency financial costs.

Luckily, we decided to go through with the operation with financial help from my family. I just didn’t want my dog to suffer in pain. 

The operation was luckily successful and she’s now doing pretty well and relatively healthy for her age. 

I implore all pet owners to please spay/neuter your pets for the sake of their health. 

I had no idea leaving a dog unspayed would lead to the possibility of ovarian/uterine infections later on in life. These things can be entirely preventable if your pet is fixed early on in life. 

If you’re concerned about cost, I know in the US there’s the ASPCA that does free or low cost spaying/neutering. 

Don’t be an idiot like me and have to make financial calculations on your pet’s life, especially for illnesses that are preventable.
Happy Birthday beautiful girl! Your white face is lovely.
I love her outfit!! Happy birthday sweet doggo!!
This dog is adorable happy birthday

ps: She's a senior pup so she can eat what she wants I'm just curious, did this cause a diarrhea disaster? That just seems like a lot of peanut butter and sugar.
Happy bday love!!

Such a cute little princess!  Give her all the redditpets atop that sweet little head of hers.
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!! Happy bday frand!!!
Happy birthday!!!
Omgggg those eyes
I love you both immensely!!!!!’!
Happy Birthday to her!! ❤️ It is a great blessing that she has lived to 15+ years old. I know it is sad to see time pass so quickly and I have lost so many pets/animals in my lifetime (including a 12 year old Pomeranian Chihuahua 6 days ago), but I try to remind myself of the blessing that we all have to own and take care of and receive love from our beloved pets. We were meant to have them in our lives. It is hard to accept it at times, but what is meant to be will be. And when it is their time, it is unfortunately their time, and there is nothing we can do about it. This is something that my mom is struggling with (and I am too but not as seriously as her) - she feels that she should have or could have protected him from getting sick (he had seizures and we think he may have had neurological issues or possibly a brain tumour). But our "job" is to take care of them and love them as much as we possibly can while they are with us, and when it is their time, our "job" is unfortunately over and our pets/animals go to heaven to be taken good care of there.
Hey! Tell her I said Happy Birthday too! 😘
So cool! Happy Birthday!!!
Such a cutie pie💚🤎🤍
Happy birthday sweet girl!

So... My first dog just reached 4 months and when I see this kind of posts I am just totally aware that I wont know how to feel when she gets old... :(
Good girl!
Nice
I have a 17-year-old cat who is starting to decline, and our family is ridiculously attached to him. We are at the point of taking him to the vet weekly for Vitamin B injections and feeding him kitten food to try and put weight back on him. This made me cry.
Happy Birthday! So wise!
Happy birthday sweet pup ❤️ and many more!
Happy Birthday sweet, sweet girl. Your dress compliments your beautiful face! I wish I could be there to say all personally and hear your stories about all that you've seen and heard. :) Kisses to the bestest friend and puppy in the world! Enjoy!

I love that dogs don't give a shit. They can be a young, very old, paralyzed and walking around with a set of wheels. They love you unconditionally, no matter what. Happy birthday sweet dog!

total awwwwwww. i LOVE HER.
I’m not sure if you do this already but I believe I added years to my friend’s life by adding CBD oil into his diet and a freeze-dried raw food instead of kibble. After I began doing this I was shocked at the difference.
Your friend is beautiful and tell her happy birthday!!
Happy Birthday!!
