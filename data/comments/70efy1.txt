Yes, snow leopards are no longer endangered, however, experts have warned that they still face threats from poaching and destruction of their habitat. Also, they still face extinction in the wild.

Edit: Removed misinformation
I did not know this! That's fantastic news. 
Quiet... people might start killing them again 
let's start a trend! what animal can we un-endanger next?
[My favourite animal! (photo by me)](https://i.imgur.com/lVpfkLN.jpg)
This does not mean they are 'in the clear'

I've heard that several Snow Leopard based conservation groups challenge this reclassification too. 

I do know that, thanks to better technology, we have been able to find them in areas we previously thought they were not present. But at the same time, they are very very elusive and it is difficult to get a good number on them. News like this is generally bad to share amoung the public as it causes false perceptions and will have people think that they no longer need help, and consequently money spent on conservation efforts for these animals and their habitats will likely lessen.
Thith ith muh thaiw.
"This is mine."
Give it a few years and we'll see about that. 

And the sad part is that it's not a joke...
Because there are greater numbers in captivity or in the wild?

also sauce?
Not for long if they keep practicing self cannibalism. 
They're absolutely still in danger... Danger of getting CUDDLES
I did a report on these in the 5th grade. 

You're welcome, snow leopards.
There are many tails like this, but this one is mine!

Check out "Ghosts of the Mountains" on Netflix. Very cool documentary.

That's good to know!

[Here is a nice snow leopard scene from a movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfjkiTB1fHQ)


No longer endangerd means less protection, 
Winter is coming.
This is amazing, they are majestic AF. I literally just finished painting one! [painting](https://i.imgur.com/XqJT2Tx.jpg?1)
It's not that they're endangered, they still are, very much so. They just got their species code changed from "endangered" to "vulnerable". 

This is good species wise, but it doesn't mean they're out of harms way. 
Snow leopards recently had subspecies identified ( https://phys.org/news/2017-05-sub-species-leopard.html ), so it still remains possible that some of those subspecies are endangered. Like how some giraffe subspecies are considered endangered. Or that asiatic lions are endangered while African lions (both Panthera leo, same species) aren't. 
There's like 5,000 in the wild; let's not get too excited just yet. 
Look at those PAWS.
"The species still faces 'a high risk of extinction in the wild', and is likely still declining - just not at the rate previously thought."
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41270646
Once an animal is no longer endangered it's immediately in danger. 
Too bad only the beautiful and adorable animals will be saved until all other animals go endangered and we only have beautiful and adorable creatures
While they aren't anymore, they have a decreasing population trend still. Really, that's the most important part of the IUCN RedList data- whats thre population trend, and what's causing it- threats and conservation actions. 

The rest is important too, but the status isn't necessarily about the population numbers. It can be about habitat, predicted decline, percentage of historical population (current population/historical population), and current range of organism vs historical. The definitions are all the, but you have to kinda dig for them on the page. 

So for example, White, Green and Black ash trees are considered critically endangered now. This was part of that update to the RedList. If you live in the Northeast or Midwest of the US, you've probably have seen one of these trees before. They aren't "rare" as they are in many city parks and forests, but an invasive insect, the emerald ash borer, has been killing them at an alarming rate. It's predicted that 90-99% will die in something like 50 years, so they are considered Critically Endangered.

The snow leopard is a population issue though. Their prey base was depleted, so they were hunting domestic animals. That results in angry farmers, which means they killed them. That caused a population decline.
I saw one today! https://imgur.com/1hrKDpV
They are NOT safe from extinction 
Did they change the definition of endangered?
This is in opposition to the Snow Leopard operating system, which is endangered indeed as all kinds of things barely run anymore and I get told that my Safari 5.1.10 is "outdated" and my iTunes 10 with its nice UI is no longer "modern".  I *love* not having to enter an Apple ID or any of that nonsense. They can take Mac OS 10.6.8 from my cold dead hands!
[deleted]
**Less than 3** would make them nearly *extinct*, which is the other side of being *no longer endangered*.
Actually they are, everyone's upgraded to Sierra by now. Hard to come by a Snow Leopard.
They have stopped eating themselves.
Nice clickbait, telling only half of the facts...Enjoy your karma

Here is a short statement from Snow Leopard Trust: The IUCN has downlisted the snow leopard from Endangered to Vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species. We do not believe the best available science justifies this decision. There is no indication that the snow leopard's status has improved.
Guys there are fucking 4000-8000 remaining in the wild, that is way to little. Pls don't think that the snow leopard is going to be fine from now on.
Global warming is melting it's habitat, it's also being poached for its fur and few prey to catch.
The cat is listed as "vulnerable", so pls don't get on your toes and think that we have saved the animals yet. Mass extinction is still going on, and it's accelerating as well
is the the one at the SF zoo?
"I hath a thail"
That's great. I hope the same will be said for rhinos and elephants in future, but it's not looking good right now. 1000 rhinos are being killed annually, and elephants, at the rate at which they are being killed, could disappear in 20 years. 
Great news.

Thanks to the brave rangers who protect animals such as this in the wild.
This is unfortunate news for a lot of snow leopards....
As much as I think it's good news I feel it's a dangerous statement to be made. Im sure some people would be like great, time to go hunt some of them.
Give it another decade. The human race will overturn that.
Snow leopard is state animal of my state in India. I m 19 and haven't seen one yet. This is good news 
Does that Khajit have wares?
It's the snow that's endangered now...
Oh my god they actually do the noming on the tail thing?

That's so fucking cute!

I thought it was just a little cute thing that Maeve from Twokinds did! Didn't know that it was based on a real life thing.
If they keep eating themselves like this they're going to end up right back on the endangered list again
I adopt one, I'm so happy when I heard the news
Just in case you have enough love for snow leopards and vodka, you can buy Snow Leopard vodka and the proceeds help protect the snow leopard. They replace farmer's livestock killed by local cats, and also educate children about ecology & such. 

Not affiliated with the company in any way, but I did meet the founder, and he seems genuinely invested in the cause. 

I up-voted this for nothing other than fluffs. Let's get it straight.
Happy to hear this!
Lies! That guy right there is dangerously cute.
Well if they'd stop eating their tails...
Yay! 
It's strange this type of thing isn't happening daily. This is the first post like this I've ever seen. 
Yay!!!
Well not anymore with that attitude of self cannibalism. 
r/natureisfuckinglit the world needs to know this 
I hope he runs around in a circle chasing his tail.
How many animals have cooler sounding names than the snow leopard? Something about the word 'leopard' is so elegant and majestic.
Their tails appear to still be endangered. 
Doesn't mean they aren't still cute af!
Hmm, we need a snow leopard Pokemon.
/r/UpliftingNews
How does one even say <3 in their head or out loud?
Rub his belly
What am adorable derp.
Majestic fuck
Fluffy kitty wants a belly rub.
I didn't know they have beards!
Fuck yah!

"I mustache you a question"
These have literally been my favourite animal since I can ever remember. This makes me so happy ❤️❤️
 This is the perfect picture to go with this news.
The furrys are pretty happy as well
Relieved to see it's not because they're extinct 
All that Snow Leopard [vodka](http://www.snowleopardvodka.co.uk/) I drink must have done the trick.

It has, however, endangered my liver.
I did an endangered species report on the in seventh grade science. It was actually really cool and made me like those big snow cats. I thought they'd be gone when I was an adult. 
Snow leopard tails are still endangered, though.
Cat

*nom*
It's great and I am happy, however we shouldn't really be celebrating. The population is still in decline just not as fast as we thought and there is still a really high risk it may still go extinct in the wild

To be classed as vulnerable there needs to be more than 2500 in the wild and have a population decline of at least 10% over the past three generations.

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41270646



but vulnerable still sucks.. 
That tail😍😍
Yes..but snow is apparently.
For now. 
So they are a threatened species now?
Snow, however...
Congratulations to the people who were working on this
Ruby Da Cherry will be happy to hear this.
While the fact that they no long adhere to the "endangered" guidelines is absolutely terrific news, the fact remains that their species is still in grave danger. I just worry that because they are technically no longer endangered that people will care less about this amazing creature and that that will put them at even greater risk in the future.
yay that's great news!
My first tattoo was supposed to be a jaguar but people always assume it is a snow leopard so me and my boyfriend call him both jaguar and snow leo.
Good job humans.  Lets not let that happen again.

I love seeing these news on Reddit. I love it when the majority of people agree to save these animals.. no matter what we disagree with lots of things in this world
I'm so happy that the Snow Leopard is not sharing the same fate as the Barbary Lion.
How about deaf leopards?
Just in time for the world to run out of ice!
it's like it killed a floof snek

I wish lol

They're always endangered
Such a beautiful animal.
This leopard looks funny and made my day. Glad to see this post.
Plot twist: now they're extinct.
If that doesn't make you happy, you're a terrorist. 
I am surprised if no one has said this yet but. I would imagine Apple had a lot to do with this. 
Thats a great news. 
Really?! Shit, that makes my day!! They are such gorgeous, regal creatures. Hooray!!
When did this happen?  Weren't there less than 50 at one point?  That would be an amazing recovery 
Dodo's are no longer endangered....and it's true because someone on the internet said so.....
Great news!
I love these guys
That is awesome that they are no longer endangered. I hope we can accomplish the same for other endangered species like tigers.
As a result of Apple upgrading their Mac OS
This is great news :). Lovely. 
That's amazing news, I hope they can do the same for other endangered species.
That is one big cat. My nornal size cat tend to hunt its own tale and hold it like that for half an hour waiting it for to die or something but it never did 😂
😼😸Good news! 
Snow leopard sandwich anyone?
They're SUPER-ENDANGERED
This made my day thank you 
If I was being attacked by one, I wouldn't even fight it. Live my friend, eat me and live!
Plot twist it's because they're extinct.
My sister told me this earlier! I cried. I love animals a lot.
This makes me so happy!
But this is no excuse to hunt the beautiful bastards!
"snow leopards are no longer..." NOOO THEY CAN'T BE ALL GONE NOOO " ...endangered" oh phew. 
But my grades are still endangered 
Shhhh! Don't say that so loudly 
That's amazing because they are so beautiful and they deserve to live 
They are my faves 

Best news of the weekend!
Their tails still are though.
But plz no hunt them
It's the things like this that gives me hope for this world.
They will be if they keep eating themselves!
Yay
I love snow leopards. Beautiful creatures <3
Yei, let's start hunting them! Sadly, that's what most people think (not you internet people, but the bast majority of people that doesn't use internet) 
Aww what a pretty kitty :) I'm happy to see their kind are proliferating 
They're just retarded now.
They're endangerous
That's me when there isn't any food.
Snow leopards are no longer endangered, but that doesn’t mean they’re safe

sooo cute
Thanks to Apple?
That tail is so fluffy.
Such a cutie😊
Wow I remember I had to make a presentation on endangered animals back in middle School and I chose the snow leopard. Good to know things changed. 
How about Mountain Lions ?
Beautiful cats
Snow leopard are badass
With all the terrible climate change news lately, this news is a big shining smile above all those frowns. 
Omg that tail is so floof!
Work needs to continue. No room for complacency. If they are just off the list, then they are not far from being on it again.
now i can finally update my mac without feeling guilty
good picture
That was my favorite animal, when i was kid. So im even twice happy to hear that
Well, neither are the West African Black Rhinos
Thats really great news. theyre too majestic and cool
This is adorably great news. 
God that tail looks fluffy
Amazing news😊
Wow amazingly. I am so excited just to hear this
Hell yeah
What a beautiful animal 
Finally, some damn positive news about the world. This one made me feel good
Really? That's so damn cool. 

This is fantastic news.
Yay! save them kitties!
These are my favourite big cats. Such a beautiful animal.
God damn they're cute.
YES
Maybe if they'd stop eating themselves tail-first they wouldn't have to worry about being endangered in the first place!
Not one, but TWO adorable snow leopard posts on the front page in two days? And one of them is this awesome news??

CHILDHOOD ME IS SPOILT
Such a beautiful animal. His tail looks so fluffy and soft. And he knows it
Sadly, though, they are still very much at risk.
Humans: Hurray, snow leopards aren't endangered anymore!

Snow leopard: *homfs tail*
Aren't they the cutest?! 
So you can finally hunt them again?
Yay!
Excellent news to hear this morning.
He's certainly not letting himself escape
But they are still at a vulnerable state...
If they want to stay that way, they are going to have to stop eating themselves. 
Beautiful and wise creatures. Respect their existence and give them seclusion and peace. 
This is the best news I've heard all week, so there's that. 
cuteeeeeee！！
Cute but deadly. Like my ex. 
For what seemed to be my entire life (38 years), the snow leopard was always endangered. This is awesome news!!
This is amazing. It doesn't seem that long ago the world was enthralled by the first image of a snow leopard caught on film. Or did I dream that?
Thanks to conservation workers and yes - zoos - for their tireless education of locals AND westerners. I donate monthly to the Snow Leopard Trust. It's worth it.
Yet their tails still seem to be "in danger"... of being chewed off! Tee hee
I fucking love cats.
I don't think Leopards who are held in captivity/A zoo count
But it is great news
In elementary I did a report on Snow Leopards and their endangered status, their lifestyle, etc. This feels full circle for me and has an aurora effect. Hits ya right in the feels.
"I have a moustache." - this giant cat
This is my very fav snow leopard pic....what a goofball
We did it, reddit!
No longer endangered and with mustaches
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
Welp. This just made my whole weekend better. Love big cats. ❤️❤️❤️
Ruby does exist now huh
Yeah, but I think climate change is causing their habitat to decrease and regular leopards are starting to compete for food in their territory. 

I believe this is true for any species that has a mountain/northern range and a southern range. 
Great. I need a new coat.
Great I can start poaching again /s
Now it's snow that's endangered. 
Of course they will be an endangered species again unless they stop devouring themselves.
Awesome, more things to eat me!  Now i can dream peacefully. 
They seem to be hunting themselves (eating it's own tail)
How did they do it, you ask? They took them to Australia to solve the frog problem and now they're an invasive species that multiply beyond imagination.
Seriously, why don't we ship all endangered animals to Australia? As soon as it touch the ground they will become so common that australians make games about running them over.
Excellent news! Now I won't have to figure out how to make them happy in my zoo. Rotten, ungrateful bastards. 
Finally. 

Maybe they can reduce their breeding difficulty in Zoo Tycoon now.

Fuck those shy fluffy cats
Fox news will probably use this to discredit global warming
Dude I wanna hunt one and get it stuffed so bad. I'm actually kidding but there's someone right now, thinking this.
I blame Global Warming for the Rise of Snow Leopards  

look how stupid it is.. its biting its own tail..   
its like durmfff guess i should bite my tail now... 

no wonder the thing cant survive... 
Hurray for Asia getting (a little) less shitty.  And if you think that sentiment is racist, *you are the problem*.  
This calls for a celebration! Who wants to go hunting?!?
yay for genetic bottle necking! 


Sweet! Now I can have one.

Well, they breed like cats.
Well they won't last long if they've resorted to eating themselves.  
  
  
They're my favorite animal so this was great to hear on NPR.
Tai Lung
Wait really?! That’s amazing very nice 
Well if they don't stop eating themselves they might be again...
What? Seriously? Yeah!
Nvm snow leopards are endangered again
Aww. He's so cute! Just wanna hug the big thing and pet his tail! 😂😍
He keeps eating and we'll be able to turn that right around
Fantastic. Somehow, I feel a weight off.
lol, he's so derpy in that picture it makes me question whether or not they should be on the endangered list. 
That one is in danger of getting cuddles!!!
Was my favorite animal as a child, very happy to see this :)
What is that called, undangered, dedangered? Could they be redangered if we're not careful?
Long live the derps!
Good news for a change <3
Let's keep it that way <3
Did you know that the cats take their tail into the mouth because the very stressed out and to calm themselves? 
Well, I guess we can start killing them again! 
Awesome. Always good to hear news on the positive side of the extinction spectrum. Too many times it's about things being added to the endangered list.
I really want to believe this is true.
Not if this guy can help it! *eats own tail*
Now they can bite themselves freely, without being paranoid of dying from said wounds. 
I'm Joe Nobody but why do I doubt this
They're so pretty and fluffy
Let me know when something that tastes good is removed from the list.
Fantastic news <3

They are amazing. Now let's go save the Amur Leopard that are similar to this one but live only in a little region in Asia.
/r/homph
❤️❤️❤️
lookit my butt
Big if true
Yup
how can they not be endangered ? they are eating them self ..
That is fantastic news.Good job.
:3
S'cute
Does that mean I can adopt one now?

I want Snow Leopard cuddles.
No wonder it's biting its tail. Oh shit
Nom
Had one with my dwarf hunter on wow. Cool nanimals.
Sweet, can I have mine back now?
Its tail is so thick!
What the hack he is doing?
They're no longer endangered less than three but what about more than three?
Shush! Let's keep this a secret! Give them more of a head start
YAY!!
Is that the big cat the dude takes a picture of in the mountains in Walter Mitty?
Yay!!
❤️
Floof chomp
I really hope snow leopards aren't prone to Rapunzel syndrome.

Is that a snow loraxpard
Seems like it's tail is about to be tho. 
Awww
<3
Great news!!
Leopardstache!

Their smile says otherwise 
I thought they were just rare due to there large hunting grounds and lack of food for them to hunt. 
"Mmmm....tastes like me"
no but seriously, how did we not stuff this up ?! faith in humanity partly restored.
Not if they keep eating themselves 
Apparently they survived by feeding on their own tail
If they keep biting their tails, maybe that will change :'(
>Snow leopards are naww longer endangered <3 

FTFY
I wonder if they were hand reared. I have a Savannah that was fed with a bottle from birth and he still sucks a blanket for comfort like a pacifier. This may explain the tail sucking.
Said who? 

Does this mean that people will start hunting them again? I've always wondered that. 
They will soon become re-endangered if they don't stop eating themselves.
[This is great news!](https://i.stack.imgur.com/SXHG5.gif)
They are so fucking cool 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmRonH_2edM
They changed the definition of endangered?
Is that the one in the zoo of prague?
Bc that one didn't seem to be too happy.
Poor thing. 
They've stopped eating themselves?
Were they endangered?  I thought it was just no one had them on camera until recently 
We did it Reddit!
Yay for the kitties! Mmmmmmm!
nom
Knowing that they were endangered first and now not shouldn't people living in mountains be scared.
Colorizebot 
I just killed a bunch of them in far cry primal
So there encouraged to devour themselves now because there are too many of them.
They are now safe, and free to chew on their tails as much as they want!
Thank you Putin!
Now it's *in* danger only to itself. Cat is eating its own tail 
secret life of walter mitty vibes
Hooray for just threatened status !
Is it because they're all actually dead and extinct? You can't be endangered if you're already dead. How do you kill that which has no life?
Ирбис ☺️☺️☺️
Obviously this is good news, but can people hunt them now?

Snow leopard no longer 'endangered'
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41270646 Worth a read

Man when you said Snow Leopards are no longer endangered. The first thing that went through my head was that species is done then. Then I read a comment and find out it not to be the case. 
I was waiting for the sub title: "They are now extinct!"
I should get some coffee.. can't start the day this pessimistically..
Thanks Trump

Can that be "domesticated"? Saudi already domesticating tigers lol
Why do they tell us when they're not endangered? People are gonna hunt them again. Bet a few people picked up their guns and got ready after seeing this.
That's Snow leopard
What do you mean snow leopard? I can clearly see its orange coat. 
I did it!!! I knew all those donations at the Bronx Zoo would pay off.
We are the kings of destruction of habitat 
For those who just want to know what 'no longer endangered' means

How come we're not more aggressively working on cloning extinct animals back

I want my children to see a river dolphin :(
"[For that conclusion] less than 2% of the global snow leopard range has been sampled using scientifically acceptable techniques, such as camera-trapping and genetics," says associate professor Guillaume Chapron, with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences.

"And those 2% have been surveyed because there was an a priori expectation that this would be good snow leopard habitat.

"This is not a proper scientific reasoning. You do not choose a method based on the results it gives."

Well this looks like a job for me
Cuddly AF.
Now they're everywhere. I am sick and tired of snow leopards.
Want
Probably because they ate a lot of apples 
Now I want one...
Is there any mention of how zoos have had an impact in this? I'm curious, since zoos are conservation focused but get lots of shit for keeping animals in captivity. Maybe people who are happy that they're less endangered now can also celebrate zoos' role in that.

The ones who nom their tails off are called lynxes
Great, now ppl will start hunting them more.. bye snow leopard.. assholes
Winter is coming.
Happy to hear this
They are no longer endangered, so they are extinct?
Where they endangered because they eat themselves?

Best news I've heard in 2017.
u/randomosaur


Congratulations on the sex. 
Please stop spreading false hope.

Wow that's such a beautiful animal.
In Ladahk, India there were a lot of snow leopards being hunted only because they kept killing the livestock. Families can't afford to keep losing animals and so it was done out of necessity. When I was there I hiked through a program that cost roughly five dollars a day and organized lodging with breakfast and dinner. I can't remember the name of the program but most of the money went into a pool that insured the locals against losses from leopard kills. Pretty cool to think that small efforts like this could've amounted to them no longer being protected.
Yay we can go back to poaching them for a while! Thanks!
Silly thing! Biting its tail!
They should be after how many I've killed in Far Cray 4
That's awesome!  I'd love to be able to "legally" buy a snow leopard coat for my wife.
TIME TO START HUNTIN EM!!!
Awesome, time to go hunt me some snow leopards!
Such a beautiful animal... This is amazing news!
This is the best news I've heard today. 
It's eating its own tail, no wonder it was going extinct 👻
My fluffy tail 
I half expected this to transition into like, "THEY'RE EXTINCT >:C" 

So the first thing they do is start hunting themselves. Silly cats.
Now, they're the danger!
No wonder they were endangered if they keep eating themselves.
I AM THE DANGER
Omg so cute! He caught his tail
[deleted]
Fuck yes mate!
Alternative universe:

"Oh, I meant the excellent sales for Mac OS X Snow Leopard. My bad"
If they keep eating themselves like the one pictured, they are just going to get endangered again. Dumb cats. 
My first thought was why I can't believe they went extinct. 
Little derp with his tail in his mouth 😍
Looks like meats back on the menu boys
Sooooooooo can we hunt them now? 
I hope it's not because they've gone extinct!
I want to bite that tail, too. Hnnggggghhhh!!
Time to start hunting 
Ssshhh. Don't tell everyone 
doesn't mean everyone should go out hunting them either
Challenge accepted! Any one want to find a hunting expedition?
Yeah, let's not get too excited. Their level of danger just decreased from "endangered" to "at risk". At risk is no joke either. It's a numbers game and a predictions game, and the poor snow leopards not out of the woods yet.
Oiling my rifle now. 
Grab yer guns folks
Let the hunts begin!!!
I think the perfect sound to describe that picture is the sound archer makes when he makes his tinnitus worse.. aka "mop" 
Bout to be in danger of these cuddles. 
Yaameean?
Let the hunting resume!
**Very** happy to hear that :)
But still dangerous 
That's wonderful news
I've always wondered what they taste like.
All thanks to a new mutation allowing them to consume their own tails.
Huh? Every documentary I've ever seen about snow leopards have always said there's like five of them left. 
"Sounds like snow leopards back on the menu boys"  
  

Terrible news, now they won't get the same level of protections as they did on the endangered list
Fattest tail I've ever seen
Snow leopards are the cutest.
No matter how big a cat is, they're still a cat. My cat does the same thing with her tail. 
Beautiful.  Thank you for photo
This is my favorite snow leopard video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C3JEM8Szbw

It completely captures their personality.

The guy needs to jump down 5 feet to the floor and in his mind it's easier to parkour off THREE WALLS first...
When cats are stressed out they eat on their tails 
Cool

I guess Ajay finally scattered his mother's ashes
Definitely a beautiful species.  Glad their on the comeback. 
Aww, snow leopards are no longer endangered?

Guess I gotta get back to work...

*nom*
They need to stop nomming their tales and start making more of the sexy so more SnoLeo
I love hearing news like this
"Let the hunt begin"
Happy to the hear that story, now the Snow Leopards don't have to hold back from eating themselves, anymore!
Not endagered while living behind bars is pretty ironic. Where are those snow leopards in nature?

Keeping animals behind bars and then arguing we are "saving the species" is hypocritical. Animals are not backed up data on a server.
When the tail is thicc
Awwwww

Yup! Now they are extinct! 
Donald Trump Jr. must be ecstatic.

Edit: I personally do not condone, and actually abhor sport hunting. If you feel you need to hunt an animal, do it and give it purpose (I.e.. eat the fucking thing)

YEEEEEEAH
We should not tell this info, now people might start killing them knowing they are no longer endangered. Just saying.

Time to make them pets. 
Eat a penguin dick :)
This picture isn't actually cute, wild cats in captivity chew their own tails when they begin to go mad in isolation from their natural habitats. This is the cat equivalent of bashing it's own head against a wall. 
But their tails are fair game...
Grab your clubs boys!!
Great. Why do people get so happy about stuff like this. It's fake news and you believe it. 
This calls for celebration! Who wants grilled snow leopard!?
As long as they live in a cage.
When does hunting season start?
Time to start hunting. 
Yayyyy! Open season!
Guess what is back on the menu!
Knowing humans...they will do a 180 again eventually.
Now that you posted  this, people  will hunt  them 
 to extinction again wtg 
Terrible news. When did the last one die out?
Great now I can keep eating them.
Snow Leopards hunting season is on! 
Let the hunt begin 
Alright where can I sign up to hunt one?
"You mean they're extinct!?"

- My first reaction after reading the title.
just in time for xmas dinner
So. Let's eat one. 
So how long before i can eat them
So...........will there be a season?
Save china, Everything is about china, China is number 1, Bow before china. Don't mess with china, china will be the last race to die out.
> Snow Leopards are no longer endangered...  
  
Yay!  
  
> ... because they're now extinct.

Perfect. Love me some poached leopard eggs! Glad to see the price won't be artificially inflated by Big Leopard anymore.
Next headline: Snow Leopards no longer endangered, they are extinct.
Hunting season is on !
FINALLY I can get me that nice snow leoard coat!
Finally I can eat them again... 🐺
I'd wear that coat. And what a handsome beard.

Are they to be hunted now?
OWWWWW YEEAHH! Now us hunters can go out and kill those sons of bitches! LOOK OUT! It’s coming right for us!
Great! So we can hunt them again?
The apollo program had a low probability of success because it had never been done and was at the cutting edge of a number of scientific fields at the time. The goal was space exploration and lunar exploration. Shipping camels to the Middle East has been done and successfully. For profit. So it's not a matter of whether it can be done, it's a matter of it making no sense. If JFK wanted to send camels to the moon and release them and succeeded, maybe you could compare the two ideas. 

In fact assuming the moon was a habitual place for camels it would make more sense because they wouldn't simply be rounded up and sold within a month like they would in the Middle East. 

Basically your idea is "let's give free camels to Saudi Arabia and pretend it's for conservationist reasons"

Your argument is "we went to the moon, which was hard, so why not this?"
