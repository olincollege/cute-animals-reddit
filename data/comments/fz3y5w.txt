That boi be goin fast af tho

Edit: cuz excuse me for making the mistake of “it’s a tortoise, not a turtle”
Can "Jurrasic Park Deleted Scenes" be the next wave of cool things people are doing while quarantined? Made me laugh at work
Must go faster

This is cut short. 
   
Here is the full version with sound. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlWu72T6Jfc
Damn that little rc truck is impressive!

Edit: haha I think I know where my stimulus package is going towards
Oh lawd he comin
That truck is doomed.
TIL Mitch McConnell was in Jurassic Park
Stop, you young whippersnapper.
If I had a quid for every time this was reposted
this has been re-posted so many damn times that i've lost count...
This is a repost...
He wants to have sex with that truck
THIS REPOST IS OLDER THAN THE TURTLE
So cute!
quarantine is really bringing out the creativity world wide, isn't it?
sigh.....repost
"Must go faster"
Master Oogway triggered
I thought first it was a tank behind the remote control car
Giant tortoises would be terrifying.
C'mere you little shit
I was watching the front truck and I seriously thought it was another truck behind it until the turtle got really close. Funny how the brain tries to fill in the blanks when it doesn’t see something clearly enough.
I’ve seen that face before. That turtle *will* fuck that truck.
Lame repost, at least give credit to the original creator
It’s strange that dinosaur didn’t make it into any of the scenes. Ima go watch again.
Best thing this morning,lol, but yeah what everyone is posting..that tortoise is in heat 🤣
Git back over 'ere, you gosh darn whippersnapper!
I’ve always wanted a sulcata. Google baby sulcata tortoise you won’t be disappointed
I'm fairly alarmed here.
Must go faster
“Tortoise’s in mirror are closer than they appear”
ngl that looks terrapyin
fuckin terrifying
This gave me anxiety
Must go slightly faster.
He’s really come out of his shell..
This is fantastic!  Best post so far I've seen today.

Request: can the OP or someone add the appropriate background music?  Or, maybe add a voice over sounding like someone on CB radio saying things like"Keep going!  He's right behind you!  *He's gaining on you!*"
Sweet. Moor pls.
The blue screen in the back is a nice touch.
For a second I thought this was legit. I went “holy shit that Dino looks so -is that a turtle?” Lol. It’s great!
I’ve never seen a tortoise move that fast. It’s like an alternate ending to Zootopia
Scary Af. Glad they passed on this scene :(
Canyonerooo
Tortoise gonna git sum,
That tortoise wants to hump that car, hence the extreme pace.
Repost
Wow this is like old school reddit repost. 

I totally forgot about this. Way to nostalgia.
“Must go faster! MUST GO FASTER!”
Gamera lives. TIL that Snopes had to fact check Gamera as not the largest turtle ever to live. [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/worlds-largest-tortoise-gamera/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/worlds-largest-tortoise-gamera/)
This made me realize how terrifying a dinosaur sized tortoise would be
Tortoise wants to bump uglies with that truck.
“Think they’ll have *that* on the tour?”
I love this but I'm positive thats a tortoise. Turtles dont look so dry and bumpy....
Aw lawd he coming
Must go faster
I have that exact same breed of tortoise
Turtle has excellent 4WD
The terror
Ohno were dying to the tortle!!!! Aaaahhhhh!!!
Need to PS the tarpaulin into some sort of Jurassic battle zone!
Their being chased by a carboenys
Wow
Deleted scene? More like Directors cut!
I think sir David Attenborough should narrate this.
Is it bad that I actually believed it was a deleted scene until I fully saw the turtle
Must go faster. Must go faster.
“Objects in mirror are faster than they appear”
How they make the giant turtle look so real!!!!!
Was more exciting than Sharknado
Man, they should have left that scene in!
It's nice to see some reptile representation in this sub
You wouldn't think so, but sulcata tortoises can actually be quite playful when presented with the right stuff to get thier attention.

We had colorful balls for our pair and they played with them so much they popped them, also one of them tends to chase me around when I cut its paddock.
I love how creative folks are spending their quarantine. Now can one of you please invent a traffic light which recognizes that my car is the only car in four directions to the horizon and turn fucking green. Thank you
I seem to remember the CGI being better than that.
Jurassic Park if it were made in the 50s.
Mr. Turtle!
it took me ages to figure out that it's a normal sized turtle
This is so much better than jurrasic world, no matter how many times its posted.
Must go faster. 
#Must go faster
Could do so much with that blue screen background though.
Did anyone else hear "Get off my lawn!"
someone should chroma key this into Jurassic Park
turtel
That tortoise is moving quickly.

Also, "*must go faster,* ***must go faster,*** ***MUST GO FASTER*** "
Oh damn, I felt the terror.
Wtf they should’ve kept this in the movie
EPICO
Take my money! I’d pay to watch a full length feature!
This is a cinematic masterpiece
When the turtle first came around, I was trying to figure out what type of dinosaur it was.
Better than the third movie, and both Jurassic Worlds.
*Jurrasic park theme plays in distance*
What? I’ve only heard his dumb ā intro
Oh lawd he coming!
Oh lawd he coming!
Brilliant and I so love the tortoise 🐢
I love your turtle. I want to hug him.
Bwahaha this is the best thing I’ve seen during this whole quarantine
take my upvote.
u/VredditDownloader
As of today I’ve worked 40 straight ten to twelve hour days staffing hospitals in California and New York. The joy this brought me has rendered me to tears. I feel like I’m going insane right now so I’ve watched this about 40x and I can’t thank this turtle enough for bringing me back to earth while simultaneously making me smile.
This is such an old post.....
He's uhh, he's flocking this way.
ahahaha genius
Did he or she get a treat after that great performance?
Bluescreen is still visible
Best chase scene I’ve seen all year. 5 stars.
Hot Tursuit
Well done!  Pretty Cool!!
Moments of love
This is amazing
Turtles are faster than I thought
That’s fun, reminds me of the Fertelli’s Jeep in Goonies. Can we get a beach scene next?
Lol so cool 😎
Missing some edge-of-the-seat music.
That tortoise wants to fuck that truck I guarantee it
Brilliant
How did these rc cars suddenly get so popular?
Is the r-m truck been driven by a hare?
I LOVE THIS
He’s amazing.
u/VredditDownloader
That was awesome! Made my day
Clever girl.
Damn he's fast
Welcome to jurassic park! *jurassic park theme song starts playing*
Me running away from my responsibilities
GET BACK HERE MOTHERFUCKER
It's just so amazing what they can do with CGI these days.
"Damn youngsters!  Get off  my lawn!"
Bloody hell 0 - Swifty in 0.JESUS! of a second.
Hahahahhaahah. I died 😂
Can the someone edit this is to make it more cool
I shat myself looking at that

u/vredditdownloader
amazing!!!
Terrifying!
u/Vredditdownloader
I love it to BITS
Is this from the movie? Lol looks cheap as fuck!
This is the greatest of the century.
Put this in black and white it's basically a classic 30's monster film!
The only one I’ve ever seen do that was the dog of my aunt who is normally the laziest dog on the planet but as soon as he sees an RC car he starts chasing it.
🐢 hugs
Not the same without the music.
Jurassic Park on a very, very tight budget!
These are actually miniatures rather than cg. The car is a toy remote car, which makes the turtle look big. Love how jurassic park uses practical effects
What kind of RC is that?
Phenomenal ❗️
Slow it down 10% to look even more real?
Lawd he movin
I only want to know where someone gets those tiny cinderblocks.
Pilot, as in “Grand Teton National Park”
Scary stuff
How I love the quarantine for little gems like this
That was awesome. Anyone know what RC truck that is in this clip?
u/vredditdownloader
How much does an off road RC car like that cost? I want one.
The editor forgot to key out the blue screen in the background!
Dang bro, I’m pretty sure
 That this was the most expensive scene to make in the movie, it’s truly a shame they deleted it
Lol
Just wait till they CGI the blue screen... epic
Appreciate the blue tarp as a bluescreen
Goood
great work!
Look at the size of that beast.
Must go faster
JURRASIC PARK: Quarantine: Week 4.
Imma git it!
"Clever girl!" That is one determined turtle!
I can just hear them saying "must go faster, must go faster!"
Nature finds a way
Very rare footage of someone actually getting a jeep dirty
Must go faster, must go faster
😂😂
Another movie opportunity for Kevin Hart and the Rock
Awesome Level 100
Repost! Repost! Repost! Repost! Repost!
You running front and rear Dana 0.44's?
Why do I feel like this is not a legit deleted scene
Oh lawd he runnin
Hahahaha this is great, I’m laughing my ass off on this toilet
Amazing what they can do with CGI these days
Godzirra
Dat boi be MOVIN!
Yeah in Jurassic Park the sound of the Velociraptors hitting its head on the exit sign in the kitchen is actually two turtles maiting.
Why would they have deleted that?
Jeep Cherokee XJ :D
u/vredditdownloader
Nice!
Now play it at half speed and add FX and sound
I know he will get that car someday after becoming sentient
This needs sound. Sound effects and an epic soundtrack. Can we get somebody to add sound?
Lmao xdddd
u/ja_y_smin
Must. Go. Faster!
Please, someone better than me to add this audio https://youtu.be/GI_P3UtZXAA?t=10
Fast
I'm getting a rapey feeling from that sprint
"Get off my lawn!"
Hurry up!... Hurry up!... Hurry up!....
Ah yes, the gang have to drive away from the great killer! The carbonemys.
barely made it out alive
Damn that's really well done
That’s awesome 😂
When you gotta go, you gotta go.
^We're ^^blasting  ^^^off  ^^^^again ^^^^^🌟
Where can I get a rc like they? Are they all wheel drive?
Repost
If this was slowed down by like 20%...
The tension in this scene is real
what that is NOT jurrasic park 😡
Prettyyyy, pretty, pretty good
Life uh... finds a way.
Ha I love this!
Can someone please make use of that bluescreen and Michael Bay this shit up a little?
Leg day
That tortoise is going to f* that truck
r/perfectloop
I’m glad tortoises aren’t sized to that scale, they’d be terrifying.
It’s been 2 weeks. Reposting this is out of hand.
U can just see the determination in his eyes to catch the car
That’s such a cool turtle. Almost, behaving like a puppy
Oh lawd he coming!
This was surprisingly intense
Oh I thought this was a young Gamera remake.

Funny.. NOT aww..
Jesus Christ
Look at the determination on his little face: ‘I’m gonna catch ya little f***er!’
I didn’t see what subreddit this was at first, so I genuinely thought this was a deleted scene.
Defo seen this before but still funny af!
Jurawwsic park.
oh lawdy he comin!!
Don’t know if noticed but this videos is in slow motion 3x
Seen this on here before, but it still raises a smile. An oldie but goldie.
Bruh I’d love to see a rear view truck cam of this with some intense music and sound effects
u/vredditdownloader
Coco large
Fast as fuck boi
that looks like a horror movie i grew up with in the 70s
Actually I am pretty sure this scene is on the BlueRay Directors cut. Which is the only real way to watch it!
bravo healthy tortoise
What kind of dog is that?
Turtledon... Rawrrrrrr
Awwwww!

Scarry trex

“Objects in mirror are closer than they appear”
I keep saying these effects hold up 26 years later and they really do!
Creative.

Reptiles cold blooded so I stay where’s it’s warm.

I got a bit scared tbh haha.. never saw a turtle go so fast!
Must go faster, must go faster.

The next Jurassic park movie looks great
If anyone remembers the movie "Be Kind Rewind," this is the Sweded version of Jurassic Park.
This is a repost. Saw this here a month ago
Crazy how far CGI has come
aww?
Thanks for the repost man. I love seeing the same stuff again after 3 months
https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/eirarc/jurassic_park_deleted_scene/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
This reminds me of that RC game they had for the computer many years back. Anyone remember the name of that game?
The yearly repost?
Try add tilt shift too haha
Upvote for the XJ every time
u need to do the ian scene with a flare
Did anyone else hear Peter Griffin sing the theme?
Polnareff going fast, damn
Tortoises walk like they never evolved to walk (and eat like they never evolved to eat) lmfao
You could've put a cool background on that bluescreen
"Must go, uh, faster"
I like this
The once-thought-flaccid Gigantopervertlesaur
No I’m not weird
That blue screen needs to be tightened up a bit.
Some Michael Bay this thing and add explosions
!!!!!!!!!

:D
This is not yours you stole it
The practical effects are absolutely timeless. They really should have left this in, what's another 18 second run time?
This might be the most posted video on all of Reddit for like 4 years now
I can see why they deleted it -- the ankylosaurus looks so fake.
"Must go faster"
He’s hustlin’
Cuuuuteee
If I know turtles (and I only sorta do)... he’s gonna tear the shit out of that thing if he catches it. 

Deceivingly destructive animals.
I love how creative everyone gets during quarantine, more we need more!
spielbergian
That's a sexy XJ!
*Must go faster...*
Is there fruit in that car that I’m not seeing?
Or is that tortoise just pissed?
Someone should add an eerie filter, dinosaur screams, stomps, and camera shake.
Must go faster

🤓 Actually, it's a tortoise. 🤓
That was better than the last three Jurassic park movies.
Call Spielberg!!
Is that a tortoise?
that is one determined tortoise.
Please tell me this is a result of the quarantine.
One of my favorite posts ever.

I was looking for the fact that the dinosaur roars were actually turtle sex noises. Disappointed that I didn't find it.

Still better visual effects than Cats
Whoa!
Y'all know exactly why he's following that truck.
Clever gurrrrl
That turtle was on a mission boy.  Never seen a turtle that focused and determined.
This was deleted because it was deemed too realistic and producers didn’t want to risk any lawsuits due to terror induced medical trauma.
Gon getcha
A giant Carbonyems
How is this cute lol? Imo turtles and tortoises are hideous.
Lmao, that tortoise was jamming, I have a desert tortoise as well.
*Objects in mirror are faster than they appear.*
Oh lawd here he come

"Must go faster.  


I mean not THAT much faster, but y'know, keep a decent speed.  We've got time."
he’s having fun! :)
Must go faster, must go faster
thats a mighty big brick in comparison of the truck..... somehow i feel this might be fake...
YOU DARNED KIDS GET OFF MY MY PROPERTY!!
Amazing
(Surprisingly it's) faster, (so we) must go faster (than it)
A dashcam on that car would've been insane.

Seems like a genetically modified [Archelon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archelon)
Everybody gangsta till the turtle starts running

Is there a shitty flute version of Jurassic Park?  It would be so fitting haha.
Terrifying
That’s amazing! Needs epic orchestral score!
Nice
I bet you wouldn't say aww if you were the one being chased by a giant killing turtle, be more sensitive
That tortoise is going super fast! Kinda looks like its having fun.
Some of the beat content on the internet is being developed during the quarantine.
He's "The Flash" of the turtle world.

That turtle is on a mission. You can tell he’s pissed.
“Must go faster, must go faster!”
That is a really smart, creative video. I think I would actually watch a move based on this. It reminds me a bit of Pinwheel Arts who animate Half Life mini-episodes.
Check the washroom turtle! There's some old guy on the can.
I'm having a flash back to the '80s...teenage mutant ninja turtles.
The turtle be going fucking fast and furious
Why havent we had a giant turtle monster movie yet?
I thought that was a real car and then I saw the turtle but instead of thinking like a rational person that “oh that’s an rc” I thought “dang that’s a big turtle”
That turtle is going too fast
Damn that Turtle's fast
I was watching this thinking "I can't tell if this is real or not" and then the turtle appeared.
