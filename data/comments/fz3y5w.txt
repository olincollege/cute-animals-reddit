Can "Jurrasic Park Deleted Scenes" be the next wave of cool things people are doing while quarantined? Made me laugh at work
Must go faster

This is cut short. 
   
Here is the full version with sound. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlWu72T6Jfc
Damn that little rc truck is impressive!

Edit: haha I think I know where my stimulus package is going towards
Oh lawd he comin
That truck is doomed.
TIL Mitch McConnell was in Jurassic Park
Stop, you young whippersnapper.
If I had a quid for every time this was reposted
this has been re-posted so many damn times that i've lost count...
This is a repost...
He wants to have sex with that truck
THIS REPOST IS OLDER THAN THE TURTLE
So cute!
quarantine is really bringing out the creativity world wide, isn't it?
sigh.....repost
"Must go faster"
Master Oogway triggered
I thought first it was a tank behind the remote control car
Giant tortoises would be terrifying.
C'mere you little shit
I was watching the front truck and I seriously thought it was another truck behind it until the turtle got really close. Funny how the brain tries to fill in the blanks when it doesn‚Äôt see something clearly enough.
I‚Äôve seen that face before. That turtle *will* fuck that truck.
Lame repost, at least give credit to the original creator
It‚Äôs strange that dinosaur didn‚Äôt make it into any of the scenes. Ima go watch again.
Best thing this morning,lol, but yeah what everyone is posting..that tortoise is in heat ü§£
Git back over 'ere, you gosh darn whippersnapper!
I‚Äôve always wanted a sulcata. Google baby sulcata tortoise you won‚Äôt be disappointed
I'm fairly alarmed here.
Must go faster
‚ÄúTortoise‚Äôs in mirror are closer than they appear‚Äù
ngl that looks terrapyin
fuckin terrifying
This gave me anxiety
Must go slightly faster.
He‚Äôs really come out of his shell..
This is fantastic!  Best post so far I've seen today.

Request: can the OP or someone add the appropriate background music?  Or, maybe add a voice over sounding like someone on CB radio saying things like"Keep going!  He's right behind you!  *He's gaining on you!*"
Sweet. Moor pls.
The blue screen in the back is a nice touch.
For a second I thought this was legit. I went ‚Äúholy shit that Dino looks so -is that a turtle?‚Äù Lol. It‚Äôs great!
I‚Äôve never seen a tortoise move that fast. It‚Äôs like an alternate ending to Zootopia
Scary Af. Glad they passed on this scene :(
Canyonerooo
Tortoise gonna git sum,
That tortoise wants to hump that car, hence the extreme pace.
Repost
Wow this is like old school reddit repost. 

I totally forgot about this. Way to nostalgia.
‚ÄúMust go faster! MUST GO FASTER!‚Äù
Gamera lives. TIL that Snopes had to fact check Gamera as not the largest turtle ever to live. [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/worlds-largest-tortoise-gamera/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/worlds-largest-tortoise-gamera/)
This made me realize how terrifying a dinosaur sized tortoise would be
Tortoise wants to bump uglies with that truck.
‚ÄúThink they‚Äôll have *that* on the tour?‚Äù
I love this but I'm positive thats a tortoise. Turtles dont look so dry and bumpy....
Aw lawd he coming
Must go faster
I have that exact same breed of tortoise
Turtle has excellent 4WD
The terror
Ohno were dying to the tortle!!!! Aaaahhhhh!!!
Need to PS the tarpaulin into some sort of Jurassic battle zone!
Their being chased by a carboenys
Wow
Deleted scene? More like Directors cut!
I think sir David Attenborough should narrate this.
Is it bad that I actually believed it was a deleted scene until I fully saw the turtle
Must go faster. Must go faster.
‚ÄúObjects in mirror are faster than they appear‚Äù
How they make the giant turtle look so real!!!!!
Was more exciting than Sharknado
Man, they should have left that scene in!
It's nice to see some reptile representation in this sub
You wouldn't think so, but sulcata tortoises can actually be quite playful when presented with the right stuff to get thier attention.

We had colorful balls for our pair and they played with them so much they popped them, also one of them tends to chase me around when I cut its paddock.
I love how creative folks are spending their quarantine. Now can one of you please invent a traffic light which recognizes that my car is the only car in four directions to the horizon and turn fucking green. Thank you
I seem to remember the CGI being better than that.
Jurassic Park if it were made in the 50s.
Mr. Turtle!
it took me ages to figure out that it's a normal sized turtle
This is so much better than jurrasic world, no matter how many times its posted.
Must go faster. 
#Must go faster
Could do so much with that blue screen background though.
Did anyone else hear "Get off my lawn!"
someone should chroma key this into Jurassic Park
turtel
That tortoise is moving quickly.

Also, "*must go faster,* ***must go faster,*** ***MUST GO FASTER*** "
Oh damn, I felt the terror.
Wtf they should‚Äôve kept this in the movie
EPICO
Take my money! I‚Äôd pay to watch a full length feature!
This is a cinematic masterpiece
When the turtle first came around, I was trying to figure out what type of dinosaur it was.
Better than the third movie, and both Jurassic Worlds.
*Jurrasic park theme plays in distance*
What? I‚Äôve only heard his dumb ƒÅ intro
Oh lawd he coming!
Oh lawd he coming!
Brilliant and I so love the tortoise üê¢
I love your turtle. I want to hug him.
Bwahaha this is the best thing I‚Äôve seen during this whole quarantine
take my upvote.
u/VredditDownloader
As of today I‚Äôve worked 40 straight ten to twelve hour days staffing hospitals in California and New York. The joy this brought me has rendered me to tears. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane right now so I‚Äôve watched this about 40x and I can‚Äôt thank this turtle enough for bringing me back to earth while simultaneously making me smile.
This is such an old post.....
He's uhh, he's flocking this way.
ahahaha genius
Did he or she get a treat after that great performance?
Bluescreen is still visible
Best chase scene I‚Äôve seen all year. 5 stars.
Hot Tursuit
Well done!  Pretty Cool!!
Moments of love
This is amazing
Turtles are faster than I thought
That‚Äôs fun, reminds me of the Fertelli‚Äôs Jeep in Goonies. Can we get a beach scene next?
Lol so cool üòé
Missing some edge-of-the-seat music.
That tortoise wants to fuck that truck I guarantee it
Brilliant
How did these rc cars suddenly get so popular?
Is the r-m truck been driven by a hare?
I LOVE THIS
He‚Äôs amazing.

That was awesome! Made my day
Clever girl.

Welcome to jurassic park! *jurassic park theme song starts playing*

"Damn youngsters!  Get off  my lawn!"

amazing!!!
Terrifying!
u/Vredditdownloader
I love it to BITS
Is this from the movie? Lol looks cheap as fuck!
This is the greatest of the century.
Put this in black and white it's basically a classic 30's monster film!
The only one I‚Äôve ever seen do that was the dog of my aunt who is normally the laziest dog on the planet but as soon as he sees an RC car he starts chasing it.
üê¢ hugs
Not the same without the music.
Jurassic Park on a very, very tight budget!
These are actually miniatures rather than cg. The car is a toy remote car, which makes the turtle look big. Love how jurassic park uses practical effects
What kind of RC is that?
Phenomenal ‚ùóÔ∏è
Slow it down 10% to look even more real?
Lawd he movin
I only want to know where someone gets those tiny cinderblocks.
Pilot, as in ‚ÄúGrand Teton National Park‚Äù
Scary stuff
How I love the quarantine for little gems like this
That was awesome. Anyone know what RC truck that is in this clip?
u/vredditdownloader
How much does an off road RC car like that cost? I want one.
The editor forgot to key out the blue screen in the background!
Dang bro, I‚Äôm pretty sure
 That this was the most expensive scene to make in the movie, it‚Äôs truly a shame they deleted it
Lol
Just wait till they CGI the blue screen... epic
Appreciate the blue tarp as a bluescreen
Goood
great work!
Look at the size of that beast.
Must go faster
JURRASIC PARK: Quarantine: Week 4.
Imma git it!
"Clever girl!" That is one determined turtle!
I can just hear them saying "must go faster, must go faster!"
Nature finds a way
Very rare footage of someone actually getting a jeep dirty
Must go faster, must go faster

Another movie opportunity for Kevin Hart and the Rock
Awesome Level 100
Repost! Repost! Repost! Repost! Repost!
You running front and rear Dana 0.44's?
Why do I feel like this is not a legit deleted scene
Oh lawd he runnin
Hahahaha this is great, I‚Äôm laughing my ass off on this toilet
Amazing what they can do with CGI these days
Godzirra
Dat boi be MOVIN!
Yeah in Jurassic Park the sound of the Velociraptors hitting its head on the exit sign in the kitchen is actually two turtles maiting.
Why would they have deleted that?
Jeep Cherokee XJ :D
u/vredditdownloader
Nice!
Now play it at half speed and add FX and sound
I know he will get that car someday after becoming sentient
This needs sound. Sound effects and an epic soundtrack. Can we get somebody to add sound?
Lmao xdddd

Prettyyyy, pretty, pretty good
Life uh... finds a way.
Ha I love this!
Can someone please make use of that bluescreen and Michael Bay this shit up a little?
Leg day
That tortoise is going to f* that truck
r/perfectloop
I‚Äôm glad tortoises aren‚Äôt sized to that scale, they‚Äôd be terrifying.
It‚Äôs been 2 weeks. Reposting this is out of hand.
U can just see the determination in his eyes to catch the car
That‚Äôs such a cool turtle. Almost, behaving like a puppy
Oh lawd he coming!
This was surprisingly intense
Oh I thought this was a young Gamera remake.

Look at the determination on his little face: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm gonna catch ya little f***er!‚Äô

Defo seen this before but still funny af!
Jurawwsic park.

The next Jurassic park movie looks great
If anyone remembers the movie "Be Kind Rewind," this is the Sweded version of Jurassic Park.
This is a repost. Saw this here a month ago
Crazy how far CGI has come
aww?
Thanks for the repost man. I love seeing the same stuff again after 3 months
https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/eirarc/jurassic_park_deleted_scene/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
This reminds me of that RC game they had for the computer many years back. Anyone remember the name of that game?
The yearly repost?
Try add tilt shift too haha
Upvote for the XJ every time
u need to do the ian scene with a flare
Did anyone else hear Peter Griffin sing the theme?
Polnareff going fast, damn
Tortoises walk like they never evolved to walk (and eat like they never evolved to eat) lmfao
You could've put a cool background on that bluescreen
"Must go, uh, faster"
I like this
The once-thought-flaccid Gigantopervertlesaur
No I‚Äôm not weird
That blue screen needs to be tightened up a bit.
Some Michael Bay this thing and add explosions
!!!!!!!!!

:D
This is not yours you stole it
The practical effects are absolutely timeless. They really should have left this in, what's another 18 second run time?
This might be the most posted video on all of Reddit for like 4 years now
I can see why they deleted it -- the ankylosaurus looks so fake.
"Must go faster"
He‚Äôs hustlin‚Äô
Cuuuuteee
If I know turtles (and I only sorta do)... he‚Äôs gonna tear the shit out of that thing if he catches it. 

Deceivingly destructive animals.
I love how creative everyone gets during quarantine, more we need more!
spielbergian
That's a sexy XJ!
*Must go faster...*
Is there fruit in that car that I‚Äôm not seeing?
Or is that tortoise just pissed?
Someone should add an eerie filter, dinosaur screams, stomps, and camera shake.

Whoa!
Y'all know exactly why he's following that truck.
Clever gurrrrl
That turtle was on a mission boy.  Never seen a turtle that focused and determined.
This was deleted because it was deemed too realistic and producers didn‚Äôt want to risk any lawsuits due to terror induced medical trauma.
Gon getcha
A giant Carbonyems
How is this cute lol? Imo turtles and tortoises are hideous.
Lmao, that tortoise was jamming, I have a desert tortoise as well.
