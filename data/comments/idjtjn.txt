Scabbers?
They look very British to me.
Young girl on the right, wasn't she in a meme?
I wish living rodents would replace pocket squares as fashion accessories. It would make the world a bit more whimsical.
Algernon
That‚Äôs author M.T. Anderson and the pocket square hamster is very on brand for him!
Me with Two ball pythons, a blue tongued skink, three box turtles, and a pacman frog.....
Man that's some Chip and Potato shit right there
This feels very Wes Anderson-y to me.
Minsc and Boo, the early years
And this is a mouse I picked up earlier. His name shall be... Tyrannosaurus.
Stewart?
Pocket Bunny
Always good to include Pettigrew so Sirius can see it and have a reason to escape. I approve.
As my dad used to say...‚Äùwho‚Äôs we, you and the mouse in your pocket?‚Äù
The guy with the rodent in his pocket kinda looks like James McAvoy-
Stuart Little stealing Snowbell's thunder,once again. :(
Cheesers!!
I will call him, tyrannosaurus
Damn, what happened to the Weasleys?
Stuart Little and family!
Lemmiwinks
Stewart ‚ù§Ô∏è
That's Munchie!
Aw, Stewart Little IRL
Willard has to be in the picture.
Why does this look like a posh Brian David Gilbert
Weird vibe in this pic, like rich cult / draco malfoy family vibe. Looks really cool tho, I dig that
Wooden Overcoats vibes.
I used to take my gerbil everywhere with me in college. Usually in my shirt pocket.
Look, it‚Äôs Ron Stoppable!
I see meme potential
That guy enters a teleporter and becomes Stuart Little
Serious family is serious.
I think a bunny is a fantastic handkerchief substitute.
Stuart Little
Awe so cute
A young David Lynch on the right.

I see a astronaut humping a pig
That little girl literally looks like Eli Manning... or is it just me?
That‚Äôs freakin cool.
dat cute as hek
Decent hiding spot from Richard Gere
I can hear his accent through the photo. The boy's not the mouse. Though the mouse obviously has a cockney accent to counter his owners posh accent.
He looks like an  older brother of that suit wearing kid that has been reviewing fast food for a decade on YouTube
How come no one is addressing the fact that he looks like a young James Mcavoy?!
This picture didn't make me go awwww, but it did make me realize I'm a sick, disgusting person.

&#x200B;

.....then it made me go awwww once said realization occured.
Rob Schneider's British relatives.
All inclusive!!

Can't believe they got rid of Hugh Laurie for the Stewart Little reboot
Scabbers sneaking in the family photo
I thought for the longest time that it was a lapel pin of white bread and did not understand this post at all
I thought Stuart Little was just fiction.
I thought this was a stain at first
Real life Stuart Little.
It's the freaking Stuart little. He's real. Wtf
Reminds me of a teenage version of [child Picard.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/memoryalpha/images/7/7e/Jean-Luc_Picard%2C_age_12.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190331225425&path-prefix=en)

Scabbers!!!
I love seeing old photos of gay couples
Getting some Harold and Maude vibes here
Oau onkfyjb, ,bhf j c√µ,.j .vlxv.n ,

It's Ron Stoppable and Rufus!

But where's Kim...?
Nice to see Stuart Little enjoying life
This has a real ‚ÄòRoyal Tenenbaums‚Äô feel to it.
Does anyone see the small creepy face over hamster boy's right shoulder?
No man left behind
If that boy ever wondered exactly what he would look like when he got older all he had to do was look at his father.
I am going to tell my kids this was Jared Kushner

Widdle liddle funny wabbit
Isn‚Äôt this a repost? And I swear the last time it was posted someone revealed that the daughter on the right is someone famous/well known
Willard!!!
**Ratatouille music intensifies**
Is that a bunch of severed human hands sewn together behind you or a festive wreath? Either way, I like your decor!
Little high little low
Stuart little
iconic behavior
Peter Pettigrew at it again.
In preschool and elementary school I was always the smallest kid so they seated me front and center every photo day.  I made it my mission to sneak a small animal into ever photo.  School caught on so I had to be extra clever.  They would search me.  Frog in a zipper pocket, hamster in a stuffed animal, rat in my hair, gopher on my shoulder, snake in my shirt.  You couldn't see the animal in most photos but I knew they were there.
Made me smile :)
Something about the rest of his appearance makes me think that the hamster is always there. He seems very mysterious.
Is this a still from the new Wes Anderson movie?
Why do they all look like sociopaths?
The bunny just be like: >.<
Gef and Jimbo! Those two crazy kids!
Chip and potato
Stuart Little is that you?
Imagine being at the same orphanage as Stuart Little and a family chooses to adopt a fucking rat over you.
Bet he pooped in that pocket.
Algernon, how have you been?
The dude on the far left tho.
Holy shit! Brilliant.
Scabbers?
Proof of the unseen third wing... The Hamster Academy.

He‚Äôs at Howgarts.
Hey look! It‚Äôs scabbers!
Makes me think of the movie ‚ÄúDr. Dolittle‚Äù
Just me that gets Adam Driver vibes?
Giving me serious ‚ÄúWeasley family vibes‚Äù from Harry Potter. They even got Peter Pettigrew chillin in the coat pocket.
Me, a little witch academia fan: Is this Amanda O‚ÄôNeill and the holy grail?
He looks like the guy who is going to defeat you at the piano competition.
After tea snack
At first glance, I saw someone with their hand over their face in shame behind them.
Stuart Little
They look like the bad guys in get out
One time i took my pet gerbil to church because they had a pet blessing ceremony the previous week that we missed and i wanted my gerbil to go to heaven. 

My mom found out and beat my ass with a paddle.
Anyone else think the older one looks like Palpatine?
Scabbers! Editing because autocorrect killed it.

Is that Jim Halpert on the right?
Kushner Family Hanukkah
Unless they look like me
I‚Äôm sitting here, looking only at the top half of the image, assuming OP is talking about the wreath coming out of his head. At first glance, it looked like a giant pony tail doing a loop, then tied at the bottom. OHHH but there‚Äôs a mouse. Oh hai mouse.
Hard 1992 vibes.
Whoever picked his waistcoat with that suit is a genius.
The daughter looks like John Krasinski.
Priorities

Pocket snack
Stuart Little?
Damn, there's a novel in this somewhere.
Iceburg from One Piece!!
Man it's so weird to me how many people can't tell rodents apart. It's a sweet lil syrian hamster in that young man's pocket. Not a mouse, rat, or baby bunny.
Stuart little
He looks like he's probably a serial killer...maybe I just watch too many true crime shows.
Fucking Peter Pettigrew
Scabbers!
I thought the daughter was sheylene Woodley

We'd not be able to do this with our cats.  Whenever I pick one of them up and I'm in the same room as my father, they start struggling immediately because they think it means they're going to the vet :P
It ain't a family photo when not the whole family is pictured. 

P.S: I want to squish that rat/mouse soo bad xD
Dad... Mason /klan.... Mum.. Church.. Son.. Deviant /sex offender... Daughter.. Lesbian/goth/nurse who kills..

Sherlock Holmes. Mouse's name is Watson
My dad always says "who's we? You and the mouse in your pocket?"

I literally have the same hairstyle as girl on the right
Iceberg and Tyrannosaurus?
Getting serious 'Harold and Maude' vibes from this kid.
Why does mouse guy look like Garth from supernatural ?
I was trying so long to decipher what the patch on his coat was.

My favorite wes anderson movie
Rockin‚Äô that Conan O‚ÄôBrien hairstyle
Thought it was a huge blob of nut until I saw the name of the sub
I've never seen a rabbit so small. Are we sure it isn't a pin or something?
I‚Äôd be willing to bet he ended up becoming a serial killer.
Danny
Hmmmm pocket snack
"Every... Last... One........." Timothy grunted as He drove the shovel further into the soil covering Grandma's grave.
That guys looks like he would either buy you shit to have be his best friend or he would tell you continuously he didn‚Äôt touch you, while he headbutts you and your coworker in the face.
