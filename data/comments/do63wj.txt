Hamsters are like little drunk animals.
For some reason, this video was able to spontaneously resume playing an hour after I shut my laptop's lid. That was an annoying way to wake up.
may the party hamster bless us all with the power to **keep on trying** even when it is difficult! xD
My hedgehog does this with empty toilet paper tubes.  It is like he has a happy little rave until he knows someone is watching and then he becomes a pissed off paperweight again.
In case anyone was wondering, the song is [Better Off Alone by Alice DJ.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgs9QUtWc3M)
Each time he waves it, a tiny drop of vodka is released.
You're already on internet on 1993?
Normally I'm fine with reposts but I am not stretching the truth at all when I say it was July of 2007 when my mother put this on her Myspace. I remember because it had her in tears of laughter.
I wish it was a longer video. I want more.
I have watched this video 1783628383 times and I will watch it every time it shows up in my feed. I love it.
i like this **very much**
We need a perfect loop of this
That's hammie boye there's a second part too
With that skill, the little champ is looking at a showbiz career. If I don’t see hamster on fox and friends I will be disappointed
Hamster dance for the new generation.
what was the internet like 26 years ago?
Stay hydrated little guy.

Throwback vid
Yeah but have you seen this? 

https://youtu.be/XZY4ovo5hjM
Is there a full version of this or is that it?
Then you will be ecstatic when you’ll find porn!
With that title I was expecting more.
he just vibing
A fellow hunting horn player
Wow you are really fuckin bad at finding things on the internet then
If this is the best thing you’ve found in 26 years of internet, you’re doing it wrong.
Uhhh, ok
You set some expectations a little too high
Tall about hyperbole...best thing you have ever found lol
He just wants to party
old but gold
I cant tell if I  should tell you to quit the internet or try harder.
Everyone who replies to this has the big gay
I don't find it funny
u/VredditDownloader
Don't know what the hell is happening here but I love this <3
Hands down
This is straight from the 2007-11 golden age of internet.
I wish there was a longer version of this
For those of you who were also thinking “if only that water bottle was a lightsaber”: [i got you](https://m.imgur.com/t/funny/p8Jey)
Boy, you're easily impressed.
Wasn't that good
You haven't seen much of the Internet have you
Lol this isn't even remotely close to being the best thing. Just an average lame video
Ok boomer
look harder then, you haven't even scratched the surface of music memes
[deleted]
My mom liked this.
damn I can't wait for the full movie
How does he do that
How can i download this with sound?
I want to see longer version of this, the end should be just a little bit longer.
owari da!!!
Somebody has to put a breakdown over that.
This video is ancient
I don't know what this is but I like it
In not sure if he is having a rave and trying to master spin the bottle or if the bottle and hamster had a lover's quarrel and hes trying to put it back in its place.
I think Inspector Norse would fit perfectly to this
Why do I know that song
THERE IS MORE TO THIS VIDEO! Where is the rest!?
I need the full video.
I FULLY ENDORSE THIS AND HAVE SHARED THIS OPINION BEFORE FRIEND!  


Got excited, yelled, am sorry.
wave your hands in the air like you just don’t careee
Now I miss Alice Deejay.
The fuck is he doing lol
I’m watching this without audio and I still laughed.
#This is amazing!
Whats the song?
What song is this?
u/Vredditdownloader
Thank you for making my day better

God dammit I put nose strips on and it seems like the world is out to get me. My friend sends me a funny video on one app. So i go to reddit and this is the first thing that greets me. Asdfghkkhl

I've seen this hamster video so many times, however this is the first time I've ever seen more than the first two drops of the bottle. This video just got much, much better!
Yeah it's funny except this has been posted plenty of times
God I hate how people talk in 2019. Somehow a video of a hamster turns into "the best thing I have ever found".....yeah, okay, sure it is...
I lost it at the drop lol
Downvoted for misleading title. Mediocre trash.

I wouldn't say the following video is one of the best things I have seen on the internet, but I think it's better than this.

[Cat watching scary movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kgRFHaNo-Y)
Brilliant
This is so old, but I love it Everytime I see it
Agreed. Can't stop laughing now
Should use the Internet more
God bless the playlist.
Meme aside, what is that song? It actually sounds pretty good
Yeah, it's up there
Is gud, is helps!
Looks like me when I have too much coffee while in the middle of class
Late to the party, but r/AnimalFFX
This and the bear one are my favorite
i can tell you're a liar because you were *not* on the internet in 1993
Is he drunk?
This is my first ever like on reddit i gave i will come back here 1 year later
It is the best thing to be found there. Period.
how can i save this to my phone videos
A streamer I follow has this as one of her clickable buttons on Mixer. It gets pushed so often that it ended up on a loop for over 40 mins one stream.
Couldn't figure out why the color was changing... all made sense when I turned the volume up
not the hamster dance song tho.
Me trying to maintain a hold of my life
He is so cute
I can't stop watching this hahaha
This lizard and that hamster irradiate the same energy

I wholeheartedly agree with the title of this artwork.
Thats the best thing you found? Search up brick vs washing machine on youtube
Worst part is how funny you thought this was :/

Love hampsters almost as much as I loved saying hampster in irc with fishbot. Where are my fellow fishbot fans.
Best videogame ever.
Nah
You must not have been on the internet for very long.
How old are you? I've been among the first with ISDN in Germany and also been among the very few with a 56k and before that with a 33.6k modem in my youth due to my fathers interest in IT. But even then It's still barely 22 years in the internet.
This video im like 90% sure is from like 2015 tumblr
You clearly haven't seen the dog fart- cat puke video.
Omg yes, coundt find this for a year thanks
I do that
Feels like old 2007 internet vibes. Like when you find this on eBaumsWorld
LOL

Was I the only one waiting for a sick breakdown after that buildup? Then it just fell flat, and for whatever reason, I felt myself being disappointed in a rodent I've never met before. All before 10:32 a.m. on a Monday. Fuck you, Reddit.
My life no longer has meaning. I can die a happy man.
After owning a hamster last year I can also confidently say that I genuinely believe they are the cutest creatures on Earth.      
       
Can’t get enough of those hammys

Does anyone know how I can save just the video (not the post) so I can send it to my gf (In china so can't just link the post as she doesn't have vpn) Any help much appreciated

How'd it take you 26 years to find this video? Pretty sure that Bill Gates forwarded this to me on the original Email
