Stride of Pride
Your cat needs kitten mittens stomping around like that.
Coz I’m Thomas O‘Malley......
I do my little turn on the cat walk..
I wonder if they do this because the stick is in their peripheral vision so they are trying to "walk over it" as not to trip
"Fuck. Yeah. Got the. Stick!"
/r/nervysquervies?
Hahaha this is great!!!
Awwww, looks like a CH baby.  I had one for some time, he was amazing.
Looks more like a smug bedbug than he probably wants to admit.
Yep. And now I have seen the cat version thanks to you. I have only had dogs so it's great to see other proud animal species!
That is the March of Triumph.
An alumni of the ministry.
Love it! We always called it the Stride of pride
How did you not die of laughter in the video cause I would have busted out laughing at my cats if they were high stepping like this 😍🤣
I didn’t know cats did the walk of pride too. My dog had a walk of pride anytime he was carrying a stick
BIG STEPPY!!!
Those high steps could make him the first feline drum major for The Ohio State University band.
Struttin’
Cat crosses the courtyard!
Ain’t nothing gonna break my stride
It’s like the elephant in Jungle Book.
Walking like Jim did while impersonating a bedbug for Dwight.
That's a Vince McMahon level strut
That is 100% the walk of a looney tunes kitten
My cat has done something similar when he managed to snatch the fishing pole toy from me. He turns and holds his head high while walking deliberately down the hall like this.😂
If anybody is curious, it looks like this cat has cerebral hypoplasia! It means that they walk real goofily but it's not painful or harmful at all.
This is awesome!

Our cat trots like a horse when she is in a good mood.
Stick retrieved, dog mode activated
Cute, until I find that the cat has some horrible disease.
That’s definitely a cerebellar cat! I’d know that walk anywhere.

Come on OP, posting someone else's video of a cat with Cerebellar Hypoplasia, feline Cerebral Palsy, to get upvotes? 

Bad human, good kitty.
u/SaveVideo
there has to be a subreddit for this big steppy stride
Sashay away...
He's not being proud. He was carefully walking to the garden so he can replant it without damaging it too much.
Is the kitty a nervy squervy? Looks like he got a little wobble to him
that type of gait looks like ataxia hypermetria and caused by a lesion in the cerebellum

Source: had a cat that did this.. she was fine and had a good life
This is likely due to cerebellar hypoplasia
Aaaaawww!
This is too good!
Haha this is too cute
Strutting his stuff
I have not ever seen a walk of pride but I now never want to unsee it.
It's called *swagger*

I just wanna say thanks for not uploading some obnoxious loud music in the background.
Very funny 😂❤️
Dos big steppys
*And then he waddled away*
This cat looks like it’s actually suffering from Vestibular Disease, an inner ear infection common among cats that makes it hard to walk and balance.
Hell yeah my cat mittens does little struts like that all the time
Walking away all smug-like.
Stride of Pride.
Bold of you to assume I have shame...
What a sweet buddy!!
This looks straight up outta a cartoon from the 90's lmao I hear the loopy song with it in my head too 🤣🤣😭
That cat obviously works for the Ministry of Funny Walks.
Vince McMahon walks like that lmao

This is simply big steppums
Yes. My cat does this with the birds she murders. Then she drops them at my feet and demands cuddles. Little psychopath.
Sometimes when my late cat KC had caught (and eaten) a bird, she would parade in a circle around the living room with extra swing in her butt. She looked like she was proud and wanted recognition.
My cousin did that after he pooped his pants
I bet that cat has CH
Lol if I’ve ever seen a pet walk with so much sass, this is it 🤣🤣🤣
Best post on here.
That's cerebellar hypoplasia, its not a 'walk of pride' its a motor function disorder.
Didn't realize my dog is proud whenever he wears boots
Looks like he's got a neurological disorder.
This cat has cerebral hypoplasia.  It walks like this because it has neurological disorder
That looks like cerebellar hypoplasia. The car has a balance issue and only walks like that
When I was a student, me and my then girlfriend had our first "let's just stay in bed and have lots of sexy fun" weekend. 

This was basically how I walked to the bus on the sunday afternoon when I had to go home to my place.
Lol 😝
He shall be called Cleese, John Cleese.
Do they do this as some sort of evolutionary hunting behaviour? Sort of looks like if they were dragging some kind of prey they might walk like this so they don't trip over it!
My void does this when he picks up a rolled paper ball after playing soccer with to bring it back to me to play fetch with it.
That's funny my guy my cat did that
I think there is something wrong with the cat, that walk is abnormal.
That is a bedbug for sure
The hardwood floor has really been heated up by the sun which is why the cat is walking like this. Put a carpet or some blinds on the windows. Some people shouldn't be allowed to have pets.
I love this
That’s so cute!

You should definitely add the song Let me blow your mind from Eve ft Gwen Stefani to this

This got a stupidly high laugh out of me, holy shit XD

In fairness I think most cats only have two walking stances: proud and tired.

Aw... looks like an animated character with that exaggerated strut!

That kitty ***clearly*** has some sort of muscle issue/problems. 

Cute as heck still, but that's not a walk of pride. That's how they always walk.
it's a catwalk silly
This is quite adorable
😆🐱cute💘
Amazing. I’ve watched this for 5 hours now
Whatever it is, its about to get dropped on the welcome mat with the other birds, mice, snakes, etc.
My cat looks exactly like this, I am not a smart man, what breed is this? When people ask me what kind of a cat I have, I just say “a nice cat”.
That is a prance.

Dogs are the true masters of the walk of pride!
Hhhha he can be a walk of pride trainer
We call it the “fuzz butt strut” in my house.
Looks like he's wearing sucks and trying to walk out of them. Super adorable!
It’s stride of pride
I wanna see an army of them walking like this

I had a dog that would do this coming into the house after rolling in some stinking dead thing. She never ever connected it with the fact that she got an immediate bath as soon as we got a whiff.
That cat was so proud of their work that was cute
He actually walked like tom when he's hitting on a girl cat lmao
Invisible boots

Someone gave the MARCH command to this cat soldier, and you cannot convince me otherwise.

My handsome tiger boy will have epic battles against his favorite crinkle fish and once he claims victory, he scoops it up in his mouth and walks off like he just won a championship in fish catching.

 That cat knows the way .
My Lord, i win😁
My BIL's dog always struts around like a hero after he's finished barking at inanimate objects. One 4th of July, he kept barking at the fireworks that were going off at the end of my street. Every time the noise paused, he'd come trotting back to us like he'd just single-handedly defended us all from those evil sky explosions. Then they'd start up again and the whole act would start over. I kept expecting him to say, "Don't thank me! Just doing my job."

He weighs maybe 20 pounds at the most, but to hear him tell it, he's the tough-talking sheriff this town needs.

When my Siamese picks up something he knows he’s not supposed to have, he runs with it in a way he doesn’t run with designated cat toys. With designated cat toys, he runs low to the ground and takes short, quick steps. When he has something he’s not supposed to have, he puffs his chest out and sort of gallops away like a prideful, wild steed. 

Objects I have witnessed him do this with: a bagged loaf of bread, plastic eating utensils, straws, any kind of plastic that’s “crunchy,” a Christmas ornament, *multiple* skeins of yarn.
Finally I understand why its called the catwalk
