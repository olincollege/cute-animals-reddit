“ITS’S ONLY ONE BIRD ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE!”
“I KNOW I DIDN’T JUST SEE YOU PETTING THAT DUCK LIKE THAT!!”
Our budgie used to absolutely hate you touching his toys he would hear you from another room messing with his bell ect and he would come blasting through like the cutest ball of rage, its hard to act tough when you're bright green and yellow
Bird : “ GET YO ORANGE ASS OUTTA HERE”
Die duck die
Was not expecting that bird. A dog? A cat? Hell, maybe a duck! But not that.
She did the double shake before yeeting! 

*Not on my watch*
Fully expected a cat lol cute little birb though
GET YO ASS BACK TO THE BATH
Did the sound of that bird running scare the shit out of anyone else? Damn my volume was higher than I thought.
So cute and feisty! I love this!
She just yeeted that little ducky just like that
"No side chicks!"
Our bird is having jealously issues. I'm working from home and since I'm there 24/7 it's bonded to me and gets very upset whenever my fiancé gets close to me.

The problem is it's the fiancé's bird in the first place.
u/fuckswithducks does not approve.
Who is this other birb and what does she have that I don't? Her beak and feathers are fake by the way, its all plastic. I'm all natural feathers baby.
We need to talk about the ducks
I was not expecting that, was waiting for a cat or a dog! 

Nice surprised :)
Para-yeet
And I bet your ex didn’t throw your stuff around like that either! Red flag! Get out now!
Nice Land Rover. Surprised how often I notice big ticket Lego sets in the background of people's home videos on Reddit. Also nice birdie.
“Ducky who? I’m the only bird that matters here anyways. So what’s for dinner?”
MMM YES I SEE YOU HAVE THE LEGO TECHNIC 42110 LAND ROVER DEFENDER
Please tell me that the Lego Land Rover in the back is your Bird's car.
Out of all the animals that i expected, definitely wasn't a bird.
SHE IS ADORABLE
Birbs are hilarious
Not on my watch!
prrrrRRRRRTTT *grabs duck and yeets it into oblivion* 
„There can only be one Birb and that’s me!“
No side chicks in this house
That was aww-nexpected.
u/savevideo
What a beautiful bird
I'm gone for 5 minutes and you're with somebody else?!
Parrots are not about you messing with their toys.
Did you pet the birb tho?
I have the exact same orange duck. He is imaginatively named orange duck and he has sat on my desk for at least 15 years now.

Once his squeaker disappeared inside and I had to perform duck surgery to restore his squeak.

He's OK now.
ParaYEET
Birb: *helicopter sounds*

Birb: *Yeets duck* Target neutralized
DIE DUCKY!! DIE!!!
I was hoping a budgie would fly in and be cheeky.
Paging /u/FucksWithDucks
Da fuck outta here
u/fuckswithducks would like a word
“Go duck yourself” - birb, probably
"That's enough of that!"
FUK A DUK!
Calling on u/fuckswithducks
FUCK I LOVE BIRDS MAN!
birb
BE GONE THOT!!!!
If I was on my phone browsing social media my budgie would HATEEEE it. He'd fly on my phone while I was holding it and try to get my attention. Or if it was lying flat he'd sit on the screen and the touch screen would respond to his feetsies and fuck everything up haha
Man this reminds me of the little man I used to have. He was just as jealous and sassy.
Scritches only for ME
WHY YOU MESSING AROUND WITH THAT PLASTIC BITCH?! I’M ALL REAL AND I’M RIGHT HERE!
No duck allowed, only birb
Girl I got quarentine nails too
Parrots are the worst. And they are basically immortal.
So when the bird does it, it's cute, but when I throw my competition off a cliff, it's "suddenly a crime!"
Whats with the ankle tag?
Lol
r/rubberducks
I dare say that that bird  is a whole lot cuter than your ex!!!
/r/partyparrot
Reminds me of the jealous dog video.
wow... no mercy
"This waterbird bitch again!"
Those little lovebirds have such big personality for such tiny bodies.
u/SaveVideo
Angy
I expected a cat to jump up. The bird flying out of nowhere scared me a little 😂
That was actually what I was expecting! The only thing I wasn't sure about was what kind of parrot/parrakeet it would be, lol. We have a quaker and a budgie. If they're both out and we're handling the quaker, the little budgie will make a suicidal mad dash towards the much bigger bird.
\[furious flapping\]
hahah so cute
HAHA. That bird took charge!!
I have a parakeet that looks exactly like that.
Definitely some good visual ASMR
(Watched it with the sound off)
"WHO ELSE? WHO ELSE WANT SOME?"
Kinda disappointed to see no Undertaker throwing Mankind of hell in a cell joke :( im not meme savvy enough to make it myself
Peace was never an option
That’s pretty funny!
Ngl, that's a bit terrifying.
I’ve never wanted a bird before. 
This one makes me want one lol
"Ducky get the fuck off"
That. Was. Adorable.
“Fk outta here trick”
I just heard it say "f*** the duck".
ngl that rubber duck is pretty cute
I like that extra fuck you on the wind up to the toss
Congrats on top billing.
LONG LIVE THE KING
That’s the prettiest bird I’ve ever seen. Fuck her.
Bird's jealousy can be extremely lethal. My uncle had one of his birds snap the other birds neck over jealousy
Freaking hilarious 🤣🤣
Release the Quacken!
nice
Hehe, cheeky bird. Love the blue spots on the feathers btw.
I am the chosen one of this house! Begone from my throne!
Hahaha! My rabbit does this to her stuffed toys if I pet them too much!
What the duck!
And people say animals don’t have emotions.
Good bird!
But does she shit on you as often as your ex did?
Angry Bird 🐦

😄😏
Fuck that Duck!
Lol!
Bet you scratched alot of ducks to get him jealous tho.
OUT! 

hahahahhahahhahah
Thank you 👍
Fuck that impostor!
Did you give your ex a reason to be jealous like you did your bird?  😀
Anyone else more focused on the Lego Technic Land Rover Defender?
That's a scream!
Hahaah and then she looks around like what? What happened? Where did that duck go?? Weird ... Must be the wind ..
Dang my parakeet hates me with a passion
"You and I need to talk, OP!"
And that's how you crush the competition or.... competitor. 😐😁
Lmao, that's hilarious 🤣 I used to have a cockatiel named bucky that used to stand on the coffee table and do a mailing dance for our female Pit Shepard mix, they loved eachother 😂
There can be only ONE!!!! ☝️
That birb is like "BACK OFF B****, SHE'S MINE"
Well its yellow and they like to watch things drop
Dictatorship 101: How to maintain power: 
Destroy all other parties to maintain a total dictatorship. Do This At All Costs.
That was adorable. I got mad anxiety tho waiting for the bird to appear hahaha
Just flys up, and yeets the duck into the shadow relm
Lol
WATCH OUT WATCH OUT WATCH OUT! RKO!
Damn poor Duck.
Why did you pet the duck like that though 😂
😂🤣😅❣️
Good bird
Lol I’ve always loved birds they are so funny
“Get the duck outta here!”
Bahahahahaha! That was EXCELLENT. Thanks for the laugh.
Yep yep yep.  One  of my budgies a similar hue (white with blue)  attack and destroyed a blue bird chirstmas ornament on the christmas tree,
Idk why people feel the need to always put the exes down, just give it up y’all aren’t together anymore...
Too funny!
Fuck your duck
A great way to get rid of the competition!

That poor duck, just thrown away like my mom did.

Dammit I said you belong to me!!!
What bird is that?
I love the sound of fluttering wings :)
u/vredditshare
This is a no ducking zone.
Yeah
Reminds me of my dog. I’m not allowed to look at, pet, or talk to anyone or anything else besides him. He even gets pissed off when the object is inanimate or totally imaginary.
“DUCK OFF, SQUEAKY!”

*Have you heard? About the the word?*

Don’t answer that!
That is sooo cute.  Funny in a Lil Birdie, but not in a person.
Love to see birbs in this sub
My parrot was the same way. Didn't matter what it was, I could be petting a pillow. Your bird will probably protect you, too. Take a pillow, hit it up against you and make noises like you're being hurt and the bird will probably come and attack the pillow.
She said get that chump outta here.
.
Lolol
Haha sweet
Ha ha
Is your bird wearing an anklet? that’s badass!
THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE!
Savage entry
sweet
Animal crackers agree
“I’m the real bird! Foolish human!”
Hahaha! This is great!
Lol
Beautiful.
The frames and quality! All jokes aside, adorable little budgie.
oh, fun fact: a lot of pet birds tend to get jealous since they’re actually attracted to their owners!
THIS IS SPARTAAAAA
Pet the damn birb
This makes me want a pet bird. But I know they are quite a handful to deal woth
More importantly.. the Lego defender in the background!!!
Those nails make me uncomfortable

Land Rovaaaaa
"Long live the king"
NICE LEGO DEFENDER!!
As gawd as my witness he broke him in half!
Awww so cute
So good
Borb wants attention 🐦
So it's cute when he do it but when i do it it's a crime
Sooo funny! Animals get possessive!
This made my morning. I have a German shepherd who acts the same. Too cute.
"IT'S OVER DUCK, I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND HERE!!"
Who dis!?!?
Lol...”Who the fuck is this?!? Get your skank ass away from my mom....and I better not see you back here girl or it will be recycle time!!!!!!”
I love birbs
Why are there people that use a non-index finger for actions like pointing, scratching, etc? It honestly bothers me, not sure why but it feels primal.
Damn - watched without expectation and walking away happy. Good bird.
I love parakeets, we always had them when I was growing up and my daughter had one for 12 years. They are playful and friendly and great pets. Our last one had a ball (a cat toy, actually) with a bell in it and would grab the ball and roll over on his back holding the ball in his feet to try to get at the bell. Then he'd love to have you roll the ball so he could chase it. I miss that little dude.
I keep replaying and dying at the dramatic helicopter sound effect her wings made
u/Fuckswithducks is a woman now?
That was the most violent thing I've seen in a while. The flapping sounding a bit like a machine gun doesn't help.
Best video ever!!
Just looking at your nails I am jealous already 😝😝😝
Birds look like fun but i hear they make a lot of noise
Was expecting cat. Pleased with bird.

Lol 🤣😆🤣😆 jealous bird

Bird is the word!!!!
ATTACK HELICOPTER INCOMING!!
Long live the King
Maybe the bird just thinks you want to pet something
This is so cute ... but only bc it’s a toy. Otherwise, I’d be frightened!
u/stabbot
Maybe that bird’s the reason why you have an ex.
I'd name her tinker bell 🔔 or Pixie since they're notorious for being jealous like that 😂😂😂 (not saying you should I'm just saying I would have to)
😂😂
Plot twist, it's opposite. She loves duckie. She wants her duckie to move. But hooman too big to shove aside. So just "move" duckie away.
🎶Rubber ducky you’re “not” the one 🎶
The duck tapping was so satisfying
She looks like a cloud in the sky
Lol holy shit!
When the owner leaves their definitely going to have a battle
My dog does this if I pretend to show affection to his toys. His reaction is usually swift and very predictable: jumping up and dragging the usurper out of my hands and dragging it away.
I love budgies! I had two growing up, and they were the sweetest little birds.
Get a fill

Jesus C
/r/PetTheDamnBird
So your ex wasn't quite so jealous and actually tolerated you petting others guys? I'm kinda on his side at this stage :>
So adorable!!  ❤ What's the bird's name???
Isn't that a he?

From what I remember male budgie has blue nostrils and females have brown.
r/unexpected
GIVE ME SCRITCHES
Le quack
no duck stroking allowed
Is it jst me who thought she meant the rubber duck at first? 😂😂😝😝😝
Is that a parakeet?
I expected a birb.

I got a jelly birb.
Avian envy
And less complicated. But she still poops on you.
I was expecting a cat. Have my updoot.
Long live the king
Okay, I admit - I expected a doggo or something
Stop vertical video syndrome.
I remember an Oprah where the bird mom’s bird despised her husband. Guy stood up in the farthest row and the bird launched.
My call!! Crenshaw!!!!!!!!
He must be evil
Jealous is bad.  Always.
Birds get so attached its not even funny.

If you have a pet bird, certain breeds become depressed if they aren't the first thing/person you address when coming home.
Lol! Cute! This belongs in r/budgies
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a goodfeather.
"And I threw it on the ground!!!"
“....My torn”

Cute
A birdie has crush on you

That helicopter sound
HOW DARE YOU PET ANOTHER BIRD, BECKY? I THOUGHT WE HAD SOMETHING...
Lol
🤣
My dog is like that. Gets 98% of all the attention but when the cat gets its measly 2%, the dog goes totally spastic!
Rivals must be eliminated!
Ngl that's a pretty toxic thing to say
Too cool and cute
u/savevideo
He can go buck a duck n be happy
How I feel towards my room mate, whenever I'm playing with something or having fun with someone else he storms in
/u/vredditshare
Not gonna lie, the flapping of the wings actually scared the shit out of me D:
She doesn't have an ex lol
Not sure about those nails
They both know you’re a ho?
Plot twist: bird is not jealous at all. Saying stop playing with the fake bird and get your nails done already.
Imagine giving BJ to your guy and suddenly the bird comes , chops off his dick and throws it away!
yo why this vid in 120fps
I feel personally attacked by this title. I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
u/savevideo
If jealousy is a real part of life, isn't that a great reason to be an antinatalist?
Can I be your ex too?!
[deleted]
Don't birds have like tiny brains... How are they able to have sentiments for their owners, and react in such ways to them... I've heard many bird owners say the same thing
u/savevideo
Can I be your ex?
Hate to see why happens when you flick your bean...
DID I JUST SEE AN EMOJI?
Ewwww, bird people
