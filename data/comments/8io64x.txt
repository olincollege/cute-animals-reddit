“Can you do the laser background?  No?  Ok.”
He knows exactly what he’s doing. Huskies are divas.
it's a Kodiak moment.
[I heard it is pretty good](https://imgur.com/rkU95jq)
Handsome boi!
He's more glamorous than I'll ever be.
Middle school picture day
I'd buy his dog food and I'm not even a dog.

Good boi
I also take [portraits](https://i.imgur.com/eYTZGOM.jpg) of my doggo. Well done. I can see you’re using at least a main and a fill light, but do you have a skip set up behind, too?
My dog’s name is also Kodiak :) [kodi](https://imgur.com/a/UoC8Unp) 
Best glamour shot ever. Gorgeous pup. 
Thank you all for the upvotes and getting him to the front page. I promise he will be spoiled with treats tonight! 
It really does look like a glamour shot for dogs, or a graduation pic. I never understood why ppl are looking up in those pics or glamour shot-type pics.
Glad to see Deb’s still at it!
“Was setting up the camera and my camera went off, thought the pic was cute anyway so I decided to post it, lolz”

Totally kidding, this is such a nice pic. 
[My cat did the same for me](https://i.imgur.com/RbYuGkt.jpg)
I see..intelligence in his eyes.
11/10 photogenic doggo 
Beautiful
Real title "I made my dog sit down for a bunch of pictures, here is the best one"
I am seriously in love with him, specially his beautiful eyes!

Heckuva standin.
I love huskies.
GORGEOUS animal
And that’s a super model shot
Perfect.
He only does tasteful nudes.
That dog is photogenic and he knows it.
This makes me sad and happy. My husky just got shot:( He's still alive, they're operating right now to get the bullets out of him. One is in his eye..
one word - Majestic.  and Kodiak knows that you know.
Dog.
r/oopsdidntmeanto
He knows. He knows exactly how the background sets off his eyes.
My childhood dog had the same name \(she was a Samoyed\). Thanks for brightening my day!
/r/husky might like this. Gorgeous dog!
Awesome picture. And beautiful blue eyes.
/r/OopsDidntMeanTo 
Send this over to /r/photoshopbattles and I'm sure they'll have a great time
I feel like this could be a new format.
I wanna print this out a million times and have everyone I pass on the street see this. He's gorgeous. 😂
Misread as “Kodak”.
A kodiak moment
It looks like a portrait in a Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights game.
What a beautiful dog!!
Perfect doggo.
How was this not the sole purpose of the shoot?
He looks fed up with you.  Better give him treats.
My Husky is so independent compared to my other dog, but when he takes an active interest in me about twice a week it makes me so happy
*All around me are familiar faces...*
He’s doing the Dreamworks face. I like it.
I think this is the best picture to exist ever
Looks like he should be the star of a Pixar movie!
This is a meme... this is a meme! I’ve never got to see meme born in the wild before! It’s a miracle!
Glamour boye
Tell the clients they can go home, there won't be anything more glamorous than this shot.
What a fucking ANGEL!
"I'm fucking beautiful and I know it- but hold up lemme hit this pose right quick"
Glamour achieved. 
I know the camera adds weight, but he’s looking a little husky. 
I hope this is framed up and sitting on your nightstand 
Can you please come to Boise and do Glamour Shots for Pets (GSFP) here?  I will guarantee 50-2,000 people lined up.

(Also we have almost twinning huskies! Good job, us)

I had a husky named Kodiak a couple of years ago who died due to cancer. I'm glad the name is able to live on! 

PS: Kodiak is looking great there!
"Now put your paw under your chin.."
This is the quality I love to paint from.
This is the first time I've heard of a dog setting up the lights for a photo shoot.  

Outstanding. 
The moment you realize this dog looks better in that picture than you will ever look in one your entire life.
You could say it was a Kodiak moment.
Well, might as well take the setup down, it has accomplished the greatest photograph that it ever will..
He looks better than any picture I've ever been in
I love the little smirk! Very cute dog and they know they are too!
I reckon Kodiak would get many more upvotes than any glamour model. Dogs > people
Now there's a head shot that will get you that movie audition for sure.

LOL!

It just screams 'Call me! We'll do lunch..'
Wow! He is stunning :)
Has a nice high school year book vibe
Cute. This also has a [40-year-old Virgin vibe](https://imgur.com/gf3Zh). :D
Siberian Huskies are just beautiful, beautiful dogs.
THE GOODEST BOI
I want you to draw me like one of your French girls

-Dog, probably
Nice dog you have got there^^
I vote name change to "Kodak"
HE IS SUCH A GOOD BOY!
that's a good boye
You named your dog after a camera?
Kodiak could be the next top model dog.
Why do huskies always look so derpy?  damn it moon moon!
I'd have this on my wall!
Damn. thats the bestest good boy.
Great bluesteel
Glamour shots by Deb
He's the goodest, most handsomest boy ever!
great lighting of course but what a sweet face
Looks like it could be a RiFF RaFF album cover 
Hard to get a shallow depth of field when your subject has a muzzle! Nice shot!
this made my day! <3
I can picture this shrunk down to a Twitch emoji. 
OP Please!
Beautiful pup! 😍
Wow, such a beautiful dog. Tell him he's a good and beautiful doggo 
Kodiak looks like he might need a cuddle-iak
Dogo for 2020
Omg what a good boy
Glorious.
Majestic as fuck
No matter how hard I would try I still wouldn't be able to pose as gracefully as him...
Kodiak is a very pretty and very good doggo.

It's missing a nice yearbook quote to go with it.

Kodiak White and Black 
Perfect
I have two huskies and I love their eyes. So much expression 
I miss my Huskies...

Wow, that's a handsome pupper
Kodiak? Seems a little too "Arctic Circle"...I will call him Mango!
Great picture, at first I read it as “Kodak” instead of “Kodiak” 
I just recently bought a Labrador puppy. I named him Kodak.
You have a husky and you’re a glamour photographer? The life. 
What took so long to post this?!
Always focus on the eye closest to the camera.
This looks like a character portrait for an RPG party member
Glamour shots you say? https://imgur.com/gallery/daOsm1X
And now you have your glamour shot. 
when the dog is more attractive than I will ever be
That expression, such subtle aspects, this is one of the most perfect animal aspects I’ve ever seen
Good Boy
This is the best thing I've seen all day :)
He's *beautiful*! Give him some loves from me!
such a good boi ♥
Kodiak is God damn gorgeous
That’s a Kodiak moment.
It was a Kodiak moment. 
Yearbook quote:

"Fill what's empty. Empty what's full. And scratch where it itches." - Alice Roosevelt Longworth
That is one good snoot
it looks like it could be a painting.
Now you just know every other photo after this will not be as good.
That is a seriously good looking dog.  He’d steal your girlfriend without blinking an eye. 
I am so jealous on several levels. I picked up my camera this morning and fired off a few shots first in about four years. 
How.....beautiful
Such beautiful! Much model!
Thanks for the wallpaper
What's really great about this shot is that the background matches the beautiful eyes.
He looks like he should have a halo over his head!
What a good boy
A real Kodak moment for Kodiak
Caption this
How old is Kodiak?! He's gorgeous! 

I had a malamute growing up named Kodiak too! We ended up adopting him out because we didn't have enough space to keep him happy. He ended up with a nice couple who were big into trail\-running/mountain sports. I assume he lives a good life now. 
"glamour shots" eh?
Such a handsome boye!!
Coming soon: The six year old virgin
Is his last name black
“Are you there Dog? It’s me, Margaret.”

Those bedroom eyes, tho!
Ridiculously photogenic B O Y E
Omgggooooood, what a beauty! 
Looks like this can be a Tyler the Creator album cover.
Aww my dog’s name is Kodiak too. He’s a good Kodi Odi. 
A black and white version of this photo will look like a dog that won a medal of honor during world war 2.
Handsome devil

Das a good boye
Kodiak had a Kodak moment
You need to commission this as a black velvet painting, and then sell it to me.
What a beautiful dog. \<3 I miss my husky!
Make sure you get my good side. Wait, did you get it? No no no, one more time. 
What a boi
Hey u/Dev-N-Danger, Is that you Max/Hannah?!?
Take out the i in his name, and you’ve got a moment.
Did you use a Kodak camera on Kodiak?
Awww you can see love in his eyes!
I wanna pet him.  Great shot.
Photogenic beauty.
“Love the lighting!”
What a handsome lad
Kodiak....Kodak. There’s a joke in there somewhere. Reddit, help me out. 

(Kodiak is beautiful by the way)
Would you like to look like this? Because for a limited time only, Glamour Shots by Deb are 75% off.
This *is* the glamour shot.
My cat jumped into a product shot once! 🤣 They should be photo bomb buddies https://imgur.com/imsSuhf
Aww, that was the name of my Pomeranian too! “Cody” for short.
How come everyone's doggy on Reddit looks like a model. My doggy has massive underbite and a screwed up tail (but I still love him).
This has to be a meme. Glamorous dog!
What a handsome boi

my second dog will be either a husky or a golden (because my first is a golden and they're also awesome, beautiful, smart and derpy)
of course his name is Kodiak
I smell a album cover.
This feels like a picture of a religious deity that every other follower has up on their living room wall
Beautiful
Ah the old "I accidentally snapped this perfect shot with great lighting while I happened to be in a photo studio".   
This is the glamour shot isn’t it?
Such a beautiful boi!
Cool dogs don't look at the camera
What a handsome boy ❤
Saint Kodiak
Thanks for the lovely wallpaper. [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/6AulOPY.jpg)
What a stud, nice shot!
Deb?
Beautiful dog!!!
This IS the glamour shot. No human can outshine doggo. 
I’m expecting a Meme out of this photo any minute now
This is quite possibly the greatest photo of a dog in the history of photos of dogs!
Even a dog is capable of having better passport size photos than me. God dammit
When the dog looks better than you. 😭😭
Haha, this looks like my buddy Kyle's dog.
I guess you could say this was his “Kodiak” moment...

Side note, this picture is gorgeous
Cute dog
“He helped me out!”

Was actually 2 hours of you trying to get him to sit still. Karma farm!
That is the most beautiful dog I have ever seen...
Welp, you don’t get much more glamorous than that!
hmmm
Because of the way he is looking up, if you put a Halo above his head, he will look like a saint.
Thanks Deb, that was real nice. 
Talk about a "Kodiak" moment.
Needs a folded paw below the chin.
i just saw this on snapchat?
A kodak kodiak moment 
Such character
Can't we just "awww" and upvote?...then gold?
I audibly said "What the fuck" in response to the sheer goodness of that doggo and the photo. 
Hey OP, FYI this pic is currently a featured story on snapchat from a group called WeSnapDogs. Figured I would let you know if they didn't ask your permission
Is that god?
So you’re telling us that it took you a year to post these?
Lovely creature
We had a Huskey named Kodiak when I was little.  We loved her so much!  Your Kodiak is a very handsome boy. 
is it weird that i wanna make this the background on my phone
It’s going to be hard to beat this tbh, good luck
r/didntmeanto
What a handsome boye!
We used to have a dog named kodiak too and he was a husky! How crazy! 
Shut UP! He’s so handsome it’s ridiculous.
For a second there I thought that collar was a tie, that's one dapper boi!
If you do not pet this dog, you have no soul.
shoulda named him Kodak
Thats a Kodiak moment.
Beautiful test pilot!
He is the goodest of bois
No soft focus??
Kodiak knows his best angle.

Who's a good boy? You are! Yes, you are!
After having to sit through a PowerPoint presentation of my co-worker’s baby photos, I can safely say dogs are way more photogenic.
He's just doing what good boys do.

Ha kodiak good name for a photographer s dog
Why does there need to be an unlikely backstory for all these posts? You took a picture of your dog and it looks great. Quit fishing for extra, save that for FB 
This dog's worst photo is probably better than my best photo.
My upvote got this to 66.6k and that satisfies me

I heard he invented the digital camera in the 1970s.
He has seen the light.

Should have called him Kodak

Literally met a girl at the dog park earlier today, with a husky/mal mix named Kodak (I think, or kodiak)...you weren't at a dog park earlier today, were you. She was really pretty 😍
This literally made me "aww"
Wow!! If you don’t mind telling me, what did you shoot with?
It’s a Kodiak moment!
Looks almost exactly like my husky haha.
It took me so long to get to the bottom of this thread I forgot my clever quippy comment

Nice. Now can we see the actual glamour shots?

I wanted to use this as my wallpaper on my phone \(thanks OP!\) but the image wasn't large enough to get all of Kodiak in without cutting him out so I edited it bigger. It's not the best but it was procrastination at least so [enjoy](https://imgur.com/a/ujTa6Ia)
Yeah, but Big Al says dogs can’t look up!
Just beautiful. 
Ha kodiak good name for a photographer s dog
Even a dog is capable of having better passport size photos than me. God dammit
Those eyes...
For a moment I thought his name was Kodlak. And that would've been epic.
a true kodiak moment
Most beautiful boi 
This looks like a pixar animation
This pic is missing something...
Amazing photo though
What a good looking dog.
Fake! No way a husky stayed still for a glamour shot!! :-P
Very glamorous.
Guess we found the "America's next top model"
Great name. We had a husky named Kodiak Jones. What a personality these dogs have! Such a handsome fella too. 
Majestic. Great name too! 
That is one photogenic doggo
What a beautiful dog!
That's a hot dog.
theres a Devient Art drawing similer to this photographic doggie portrait... cept' its a goofy cat.
I thought your dog's name was Kodlak, given it's meaning I thought it was a cool name. Then I read it again and now I'm disappointed.
Majestic boye

Seriously, this dog is beautiful and majestic.
