That kitty is a representation of so much in that boy's life right now.  I hope that he is able to find more of what he has lost in the near future.
Poor guy. You can tell he's been crying his eyes out.
I'm so glad they are reunited. War sucks. My grandma had to leave the family dog behind when she was just a child when she and her family fled from Poland during WW2 and to this day cries when she talks about the dog.
Cat is like "*I've seen crazy shit for a while, where the fuck have you been*"
When you have a cat it can often feel like they don't care about your existance. But when they run into YOUR arms for safety when they're afraid makes it all worth it. Mr. Stevenson used his last bit of strength to crawl into my arms right before he died. I feel so immensely blessed to know I was his safe space. I miss that boy.
I love how the cat's trying to play it cool and look like it doesn't care, but if it really didn't want the hug, it wouldn't allow the hug.
War is hell
This is great!  Everyone needs a plan on how to move their pets in an emergency. I have two cat carrier backpacks just for this use. Along with food and extra meds. You never know when you could be displaced, not just war(sucks) but hurricane, tornado, flooding, fires, other civil unrests. Don’t need to be a preper to be prepared.

Aww!!!

If any Ukrainians are reading this... 

Netherlands (maybe other countries as well) is setting up housing for families + their pets. They will try to keep you together with your pet, but at the minimum you all will be safe.
I just want to scoop those kiddos up and give them a hug. So heartbreaking
Pets are family
The look on his face breaks me
Feel so bad for all these kids having to go through this shit. Puttin is a monster
That’s the face of a pet owner that doesn’t let such things like war get in the way of her and her human!
One of the first images I saw of bombed-out apartment buildings in Ukraine was of volunteers rescuing pets and reuniting them with their humans. 

The unconditional love of a companion animal must be a huge consolation when you've lost everything else.
If that doesn't tug at a person's heartstrings, nothing would.
I'm about to cry too see he's so happy
stay strong little ones! wishing them the best
that child has adult-sized emotions on his face.
I really feel sorry for these children. No child should be forced to experience war
War is confusing to adults. Imagine to a young child like that.
The look on that cat's face. He has seen some shit.
So beautiful. Such a wonderfully human perspective of this terrible conflict. I hope we get to see many more of these of every man/woman/child/pet returning safely.
I dont wanna think about those poor dogs and other animals who are left without a family or home. Traumatized and starving :(
This is so sweet but it also makes me so incredibly angry. No child should have to go through that. Fuck poo-tin and all of his dick waving. The world would be much more peaceful without him.
This picture hit me really hard. That kid looks just like one of my little brothers and imagining someone so young experiencing such pain… it’s devastating
The mix of heartbreak and hope on that child's face speak to us about humanity and our quest to have rights and freedom and peaceful, productive lives. How dare anyone try to steal that?
I grew up with a cat who was also my best friend. Growing up, he got lost for months one time because dad had decided to bring him to our cabin, and then left the cabin without him!!Somehow he made it back after being miles away from home, I just got to see him one last time before I had to move away to America. I have never cried so hard in my life as the months prior to finding him again. After I moved I continued to cry for years, literally every single night for years, hours on end I cried. I’ve never felt so heartbroken in my life to have to leave my kitty. I still cry when I think about it. This picture reminded me of that. I’m so happy he found his kitty again.
🥺
Well that’s nice 😭😭😭😭
OMG THATS A GOOD KITTY
War is evil.

Glad this boy was reunited. Miracles do happen
I need to stop cutting onions.
Bless his heart.
Life is too cruel
One of the only comforting things that remains "normal to this boy! Someone get him a harness and leash
I’m so thankful my country is providing for refugees across the world.

It doesn’t matter where the child is from, war should have never been an experience. 
As bad as I think I have it sometimes, these pictures remind me of the comforts of humanity that I take for granted.

I was playing Nintendo and getting frustrated with math at his age.
A part of me wants to scream get the camera out of his face and give him space.

A larger part of me knows the world has to see these images to know the cost of unwarranted aggression.

I am so glad him found his kitty, I hope that is one of his first steps towards healing.
Awwww that makes me so happy
Oh boy what is this water coming out of my eyes
The cat: "You can't interrupt my reunion with my hooman"
I've been there. all you want to do is crawl into a small room and lock the door with them.
This is the most beautiful thing I’ve seen today🤗
I worry about the cats in ukraine. So many will have trouble traveling and adjusting to new, albeit temporary homes. My heart goes out to the families supporting refugees right now. I wish we could help somehow by donating supplies to people migrating their pets to new countries.
That cat has seen some shit.
aww you can tell he really loves his kitty 🥺🥺🥺
This is the part where some pro Palestine user jumps in and writes “what about the Palestinian cats?”
That cat is straight up like, "bro we gotta get the FUCK outta here."
Oh my, the look on his face. He’s got some life back today.
![gif](giphy|3o6ZtlMx1JUwf3qYiQ)
Cat went out to destroy some russian tanks and came back
I feel this
Oh, happy days. I hope this young man and his cat have many more years together.
That cats had enough of this shit.. look at his face lol. Poor kitty. Glad he’s back with his boy.
I seriously hate this shit.
Sweet babies... they don't deserve all this mess from the adult humans. :'(
Animals are part of the family, they shouldn’t be left behind
All these poignant photographs of Ukranians escaping with their cats triggers the image of any one of my cats (all dead now) wiggle/squirming their way out of my grasp if we were in the same situation. I might say "Cat Carriers For Ukraine!" but don't want to sound flippant.
That cat seen some shiet
I am a volunteer at the Kraków main train station. I've seen so many families with their cats and dogs.
that cat looks like hes seen someshit
That’s something I’ve been thinking about a lot recently. How many pets are killed in bombings, or run away because of the explosion, that get lost as the family flees, or that the family simply can’t take with them? It breaks my heart. These people, and any people forced to flee their homes, lose everything. Their house, their school, their belongings, and worst of all, potentially their loved ones and pets. 😞
![gif](giphy|pynZagVcYxVUk)

This got me fucked up. I'm so happy he found his humans
Bless his little heart.
I am so happy he got his cat back and so angry he ever lost him.
I hope Poland gets a peace prize for letting people bring their pets with them. So many things are wrong in the world and Poland has the heart to recognize that they don’t want to make it worse by giving people a hard time about bringing pets.
Fortunately the cat is not black or it will have difficulty crossing the border
That cats seem some shit
pray for ukraine
Hi guys, is there someone who wanna talk about this war ? Im Russian, so i wanna listen your own opinion about situation, but without negative pls
I can’t believe there are actually heartless individuals who support the Russian bombings of these kids’ and their furry friends’ homes.
Amazing.
That cat looks like he's seen some shit though.
**Never give up on hope!**

**Do cats in colder countries like Ukraine and russia have thicker fur to keep warm?**
Sick fit
That cat has seen some shit.
who’s cutting the onions? 🤨
People love their animals. Is that what makes us humane.  I hope the borders are allowing people with family pets in and not separating them.  We could loose our humanity, plus emotional loss of family members.
Bless the child kitty and the opportunity to come back together!
That ain't no *kitty*; that's a *CAT*.
that cats seen some shit
Ok I was out of this conflict till now. Fuck you Russia.
It's a terrible day for rain
I hope this isn’t fake. It’s really adorable.
Awesome
I know that feel little man
Aww poor little dude, I’m so happy he got reunited with his friend. Such senseless bloodshed and hatred, sad to see…
I'm not crying, you're crying!!
I hate that war effects the children so much.
Countries within the European Union have granted Ukrainians ability to freely travel between states.
Ohhhh the faces. The absolute relief on the kid’s face, the obvious affection of the other kid. This breaks my heart.
I'm so glad he found his kitty. 😭😥
Wow
Oof. 🥺💙💛
That kitty has seen some shit
Omgoodness.  Look how happy he is. This brings me to tears (happy tears).
I needed this.
Sending love
Don't cry, Donate!
Yay!!!
Let’s go
Snuffles looks like he’s seen some shit
Reminds me of bubbles with his kitties

Awww, buddy. Congrats little guy
🇺🇦❤️
I’m happy that he found his cat but the cat looks fucking pissed😂
Cat looks like its seen some shit
Aww
Aww happy tears from a happy kid. I hope the stupid war ends soon
the cat looks fucking terrified what happened to that cat
I have my mind blown right now because this kid is my son's doppelganger. So happy he is reunited with his cat.
I think kitty will agree Ukraine should join NATO for all the reliable support they have provided
That is good to know, my cat disappeared on me.
I love how his buddy behind him is smiling for his friend.
That cat looks so scared
Yeah, I needed a good cry today.
Young Ukrainian refugee boy reunited with his kitty that he had lost while waiting to cross the Polish-Ukrainian border
Hope this boy lives in peace someday. go ukraine.
Lives being destroyed for what?
Bruh his face just on the verge and breaking into tears says it all - Aw🥺🥲
Me too little buddy, I’d take on Russia solo if they hurt my cat!
Holy shit what are the odds??? Good for that kid.
And everyone liked that
Little boys face says it all! I’m glad he found his kitty.
Cat looks like he’s seen some shit
You can tell by looking at his face, that cat has seen some shit
The cat is looking back like “could you please fuck off and not film this?”
These people have lost so much because of 1 madman.
Cat: Ви не уявляєте, що я бачив... слава Україні, слава героям!
Makes my day.  Never leave any family member behind.
Wish there was a way I could donate a cat carrier for him (or anybody else who needs one).
I love my cat more than I thought it was possible to love anything and if we ever got separated like this I think I’d lose my mind. I’m so happy they got reunited. Picturing my little guy cold and alone and scared is making me tear up just writing this. He’s been dealing with bronchitis for a while now and the most recent round of antibiotics didn’t help much so I’m thinking about things like this a lot right now. I’m gonna go donate to the animal shelter where I got him from right now.
Aww༎ຶ‿༎ຶ
Get that kid a hug
I just hate that this is even something that the little boy and kitty had to face
My heart goes out to those children of Ukraine
The expression on the child’s face says so much about what he has been through.
Help this boy and his cat: if your US senator/representative is one of the group opposing sanctions on Russia or talking trash about the Ukrainian president, tell them you're angry then vote against them in the next election. Stand up for your belief that dictators shouldn't bomb boys and their cats.
That cat has ***seen. Some. Shit.***
I wish there's something I could do.
That cat has seen Shit.
Zero is the only number of children that should be separated from their kitties.
Of course the kitty is a Russian Blue
Syrian kids.........
Yo why did I think that was a giant rabbit
Aawww  nice  sorry they have to go through this
That cat has seen some shit.
That cat looks like it’s seen some shit
That cat has seen some shit
Cat looks like he wants to go back and shit on a Russian tank
Why are some people seeking stardom and accolades, for what lol
there is nothing 'aww' about children in war! what is wrong with this subreddit
And it's a Russian Blue cat too
If you are a refuge, It realllllllllly helps if you are ✋ than if you are ✋🏽
Cats face says otherwise
Did the kitty walk 600 miles in 6 days, too?

That dude’s gonna grow up and John Wick some Russians, I’m calling it now.
If this is more fake news ghost of Kyiv ish I’m gonna be so pissed at y’all 😂😩
“Hey ma! There’s a weird fuckin’ cat outside!”
Is that a Russian Blue? If so, irony. Or maybe a Scottish Fold.
. This happens to black and brown refugee constantly . No ever cares though .
BLACK LIVES MATTER ✊🏿
Dann guess i have comepletly different definition of aww. Guess i Gitta leave another cutesy reddit
how about we post a boy a yemen see how many likes it gets... its crazy how the west controls all social media
If only Americans cared as much about the children in their own country
It's a shame they put fucking cats in front of human beings
Boy reunites with his cat has 105k upvotes on reddit. A guy loses his whole family in Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq...is normal. I didn't believe in segregation but I guess white christian civilized refugees are the people who get the attention nowadays. I won't answer any replies on this comment, so type whatever you want idc.
Have no fear little ones, for you are the children of God, and yours will be paradise.
A prayer 🙏 for you and family from Texas 🤠
It’s a girl not a boy. Little boy behind her is her brother who lost the cat and then she found it.
If you crop the top left corner of just the boys faces, the kid on the left looks like a psychopath
Okay , this is some Emotional stuff right here.... Oh goodness
The human element is so tragic and is heart wrenching, and my heart completely breaks thinking of all the pets who had to be left behind, just completely lost and left to fend for themselves.  Aw shit :(
This war is just ripping my heart out.
Shit, that would be my reaction and I'm 3.
Mingkay =3
That's whole some.
The cat looks surprised
The best ending
That cat looks pissed.
I want to see the look on the cats face
i absolutely hate cats (im terrified of them) but this is just so heartwarming it might make me cry
r/mademecry
That’s a cute bunny rabbit
One of those things that makes me so happy but so sad at the same time

![gif](giphy|dXLP6Hw8aMD9VqwicP)
It's probably so stressed in this picture that it might not even realize who's holding them. I'm sure once the kitty gets to a safe and quiet spot it will recognize the boy.
Вася!!
Eastern European wiggie
That cat looks like he's seen some shit to get where he is.
Release me tiny human.

The ruskies have not yet bear witness to the full terror of my claws
Zoom into the cats face. That cat has seen shit.
Cat looks like he's seen some shit
Ugh. This kills me.
Beautiful cat, I hope he's not cold.
Cat has that look like “Dude, let me go. The Russians are after you, not me.”
Nothing justifies taking kittens away from little kids. Not even Doom music.
The strong vigilance amid kitty's glance reveals how bad the war is.
That cat has seen some shit! Fucking thousand yard stare.
I can’t do it with the poor lovely cats, too much
Kitties, and all animals are greatly important
That cat has seen some shit
saddest thing have seen in this event
My prayers for all these poor souls. A moment of joy in a nightmare. Sending prayers.
Even during a goddamn war, our pets still take care of us. That little boy and his kitty are just so beautiful and pure. Thank you for sharing this moment with the world. :)
Was the cat waiting for him in Poland?
It’s a Russian blue 😂
Holy shit. Wrangling a cat for more than a few meters is impressive.
The cat looks like he saw some shit
Foldie!
Kitty still showing him attitude
this is kiilling me i feel so bad for the peole and worse for the kats
We should send some cat transport cages to the borders so that uncaged cats can get one. Im assuming they had to leave in a hurry and thus didnt have time to get the cat in a transport cage.
https://youtu.be/v088c_FkHSE
Is this cat real?
Cool. But how were they reunited? What identification did they use to prevent someone from taking someone else's cat? Chip? Collar?
I can physically feel the purring.
That is a plot to an animal movie if I saw one.
Morning made
My heart can’t take it.
Pedophrasty?  What's that?!?!
You have the power to help stop this war if you act right now. By the united actions of the adequate people from civilized countries, we can protect the world together. Speak up to your politicians, call for actions, not just words of support!
I hurt for these people. I think about the adversity that people go through every day. It makes me feel bad about not wanting to live sometimes.

This boy deserves the world. Ukraine, Yemen, Afghanistan, my heart is with everyone. I’m tired of seeing the exhausted faces of people who are beaten down and treated horribly.
I’ve seen about four different images or videos of refugees with their cats and they all have been the same breed. The breed with the crumpled ears. Scottish Fold? Anyway, just thought it was interesting. Must be a popular breed in the region.
😭😭
I’m incredibly happy for that child. Can only imagine how happy he must’ve been when he saw his cat again
I thought it was a rabbit.
Wowzers!  Thx for the waterworks!
![gif](giphy|XoW2jShBRKkxO)
The cat doesnt look that jazzed
Oh man! That was the worst horror. 
So many having to traverse to Poland with no time to get a pet carrier and having to carry kitty in their hands.

Sadly the one area where I'd rather have a dog as cats may or may not follow or catch up to you later if they scramble out of your arms.
Is it just me or are Ukrainians cat whisperers? I’ve never seen cats be so comfortable with being wrangled. Then again, I’m sure they’re happy to get away from the war too
That cat has seen some shit
❤️
this is heart-warming but omfg that cats face the things hes seen
 Very happy for him! I’m glad they reunited!!
Awwww :( I’m glad they’re out of there but man, horrendous.
Stop hurting kids!!

Kitty ❤️
Everybody is a hero.
Amazing
I love Scottish fold, extremely cute cats happy to see the kid with his friend again.
Sobbing now
How…
Why does that cat have a "awe shit, here we go again" face? Is it just me? 🤣🤣
Bless them all they’ve seen some shit!
Especially that lost cat
These are the stories that make my day that much better. So happy they were reunited.
Thanks. I think I'll go hug my cat now too 😥
Coming from a parent, I can safely say that's not the same cat. /s

But fr my heart goes out to this little guy, his furry friend and all those displaced.
The look of being reunited with your best friend in the world
A young Ukrainian girl talks to her pet bird as she waits at Kraków train station. Charities and human rights groups say they have seen cases of children going missing in the chaos at border crossings.
I believe it's pronounced "chonkus".
Oh that sweet face makes my heart hurt
What the world 🌎🌍is Love💕 💕
#LetLoveLeads!
That cat looks startled.
I’ll save that cat!
Looks at the face of that kitty XDDDD
These kids are our hope for the future.
That cat looks like it has seen some shit
That's amazing and awesome.
Ohhh angel 😇 😭😭
Nice
Awww he loves his kitty🥰❤ So sad
That boy's expression...
That look on his face is priceless
Very beautiful little boy
That cats giving side eye like "fuck I thought you'd never find me"
That cat has seen some shit.
I love you guys! Stay safe
This just breaks my heart knowing how many animals have been left behind or lost in this disgusting attack.
Бідні змучені діти.
Too much emotions! Go kid and kat
This boys expression. Uncertainty, fear, cautious joy.
can we talk about the boy on the left's absolute drip
The tears of joy and relief in the boys' eyes warm my heart. She is one beautiful AND lucky kitty! May they have decades together
Уууу как жаль его
Kunkoosh, but Ukrainian.
Cat has that thousand yard stare now. Probably seen some things.
You better get that cat in a carrier! The look on his face is giving he’s about to dart out of there.
Awesome those poor people my heart breaks for them. Really puts things in perspective
Thats a full grown cat bruh
D  o
That cat looked traumatized af
God, I just want to give him a hug.
my heart❤❤❤❤
The cat looks just like my scottish fold that I had to put down last year. This one hits hard… so happy that they’re reunited again.
The cat doesn't seem too happy about it.
Glad you got your cat back little dude 👍
He would probably prefer to be reunited with his home
Fuck this life, this can happen. What is wrong with us all??
Saw an interview CNN was doing with a man in Ukraine who had his home destroyed, he lost every member of his family. As they were interviewing him he was going through the rubble of his home and he found his cat. Somehow his old cat survived. The man went from dead eyed to wrenching sobs just holding his cat. It’s been weeks since I saw that interview and I can’t get it out of my brain.
I have no words for this, it is amazing that little good things can happen even in the worst circumstances
Wonderful
What's wrong with the cats face
The cat looks like he wants to defect to the Russians
Cat has seen some shit
Heartbreaking. Is that cat a Russian blue?
Fuck this fucking war
That’s not “aww”. You can clearly see the sadness in their face.
What a chonker
Soooo…… big kitty, or small boi?
He's not the only one crying
This cat has seen shit.   O.O
What a blessing and a reminder about what is most important.
It makes me happy he got his friend back. Those poor kids. :(
This is the first war in which digitalization has reached even the poorest/the ones who can’t flee the country (or at least the poorest in Ukraine). War is so sad and I hope we don’t normalize these events in the future, but if social media has told us anything, we probably will.
That cat looks like it's seen some shit
Smile on his buddy’s face is priceless. Love will prevail someday.
That’s one nice kitty right there
That cat looks terrified, boy looks very emotional. 

My whole heart♡
Cat done unspeakable things to the Russians
You have the power to help stop this war if you act right now. By the united actions of the adequate people from civilized countries, we can protect the world together. Speak up to your politicians, call for actions, not just words of support!
I’d die on the inside if I lost my cat..Poor kid
why are my eyes are getting wet?
That face
:(
Awwwwwww!! They are safe!!
You can tell that cat has seen some shit
He better keep that cute guy
And what abaut #save Donbass people?
❤️❤️❤️ this breaks my heart. 
💔💔
❤
Dinner for two
The look on his face says it all, I've lost and found my pets multiple times I can't imagine what he's feeling being in a warzone like that
So happy for him!!!!!!!!!!!!
Makes me so sad thinking about how many cats have been lost during wars
Awww poor baby. I’m sure kitty is so relieved to see them too. I hate this war, hopefully it can end very soon.
Damn ninjas cutting onion again
While my heart aches for their shared needless suffering I’m simultaneously overjoyed that they both got their best friends/family members back. You two hold on tight to each other, no matter where you live you’ll always be home as long as you’re together.
awe....we can relate! our pets are our babies!!!!
I’m so glad if this is correct and he got the kitty back.
look at the cat's eyes, that thing has seen some shit
Fat cat
Woah That’s a Scottish Fold too!
💗💗💗🙌🙌🙌
💗💗💗💗💗
That’s cats face…. Ffs I thought we agreed on no crying …
KITTY!
Heartbreaking
Even that car is shell shocked. Zoom in on his eyes.
Bless you all
Reminds me of that poor kid during Hurricane Katrina when the cop wouldn’t let him take his dog (Snowball) on the evacuation bus. Kid kept crying “Snowball!” and was sobbing so hard that he vomited. I never forgot the unbelievable heartlessness of that situation and followed the story periodically for a few years, but Snowball was never found. Glad this had a happier ending.
I’m literally crying
Grey cats... Fluffy, good looking and, weird looking eyes.  Grey cats know how to attack if petted the wrong way.

Happy to see the boy and his cat back together.  Such an emotional photo.
The look of relief and love on his face is priceless. Poor little boy leaving his homeland in war.
Kitty
Excuse me a moment while I sob uncontrollably 😭
This hit me right in the feels! That look of sheer gratitude on that boys face! Made me cry a little bit. ❤
I'm so happy he found his kitty. They're already losing so much - to have a beloved pet will be much comfort.
Does anyone know how all these refugee cats are getting fed? Dogs can eat a lot of human food but cats can't so much.
I know it's a good thing but it's still heartbreaking seeing him cry like that
All the feelings, just all the feelings on display
Look at that face…so glad he found some relief in his uncontrollable pain
This is amazing! I wonder if the cat found him by following his scent. It seems so unlikely they’d be reunited in this crazy moment. But look at those sweet tears of joy in his eyes. 😭
See the heartbreaking look in his eyes. He’s holding his cat like it’s all he has ….like he doesn’t know when he’ll see his dad again . 
May the warmongers rot in hell.
My heart breaks for these people.
I feel you kid.
You can see the relief in his eyes
Cat could not give 2 fucks...
That cat looks like it has seen some things.

that's not a kitty that's a full blown cat! Still happy they are together.
Diabetus
wat da cat doin
I feel this.
this isn’t awwwww, his country is being fucked over by some bald ass horse riding bitch, this isn’t wholesome it’s sad he was in that scenario to begin with
 The story I needed today.
Oh gosh. That glare form the cat is like ‘I will eat your soul.’
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)
Fucking war hurts deep
How do we know that? Just not a picture of a cat. More context
According to who?
That cat looks like it wants to go back
Kitty looks like he's seen some crazy ish
Looks like a Russian cat breed
Anyone got the full story?
For some reason I thought this was a goat and got so confused when I saw the word kitty. But upon closer inspection, that checks out
Precious
So sweet!
Cat was trying to join the foreign legion but got rejected for lack of previous combat experience.
That BSH looks like he’s scared. But very welcome to be with his family.
Is that a Scottish Fold he’s holding!?
The boy loves it. The cat looks like it does not.
😢😢🙏❤️
Cat looks happy too.
I thought that was a goat
Damn mission escape failed
billie is that you?
I can't imagine kids going through that. Why we just can't live in peace, or at least stop this from happening.
His face is heartbreaking.
I'm crying. My cats mean so much to me and I can't imagine what it means to him..

Without explanation this poor kid is taken from his everyday life, he isn't even old enough to understand the severity, it just sorta pushed on him. 

This cat is a representation of the normalcy. The life before this horrid invasion.

I'm so glad for the both of them.
He thicc(the cat)
A very happy moment for lives in turmoil.
Pets are family.
How did he find him??
Finding happiness in little things matter. I wish both the kid and the cat find support they need. If I am in Poland, I would volunteer to help these people. Instead, I just donate money because I cannot afford to leave my job to travel and help these people in person. Lots of people around the world I'd doing exactly that and I hope those donations are put to good use.
I live in Germany and we are also seeing so many refugees coming in their pets and little else.
They need each other more than ever.
Told some kid I saw on the street holding his cat that I was going to take his cat.

Took a pic of his reaction. 

Made up a caption and posted to reddit.

Success.

Kids in cages in the US: you get refugee status and get to keep your cat?

I know, I know: ^(he's white).
They probably just got him a random cat
Isn’t that a Russian cat though ?
Why do Europeans do this to each other? Is it part of their culture to start wars?
War sign up at your local enlistment center. Go get ‘em boys!
Yeah ok
this cat looks like it was on their way to go shit in someone’s cereal and has been thwarted. 

by day, child’s best friend. by night, shit saboteur— pooping and vomiting in every russian soldier’s sleeping bag and shoe. the hero we need.
This is so fake
Ugly ugly boy ewwww
Cool
Wasn't that fake?
In Germany in many towns they say to Ukrainian Refugees you cannot live with your pet and must give it away…
I love that we can identify the type of cat but not if this story is real

I don’t like but it’s paper but I have the buy me that has everything in it and go home look at it see if there’s anything on there I like it and bring it back and I can go off of th

Deb be sc
Ah yes, scary russian firefighter cat.
Who cares
For all we know these are Canadian kids travelling to Hawaii for vacation. Insane how just mentioning Ukraine without source get you upvotes
I guess well just take your word for this being true… unless you have a source?
Bitty
How are all these cats from Ukraine so chill in a war zone or with a lot of people around?   Mine can’t stand to be held like that for more than 3 seconds. — after that they are running off for good.
Don't use children like this, for reddit points.
So true. They should make a book out of them. I would buy it and read it and cry all the time.
How old is this kid, 10? Isn't he supposed to stay and fight?
