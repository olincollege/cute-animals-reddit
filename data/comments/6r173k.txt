You will note on my resume that I have fetched the ball numerous times. My references are Comet, Dolly and Bowser. They can be reached at this shelter. 
Oh my fuck. This dog looks like he's straight out of a Disney movie. He's so cute that he doesn't look real.

Oh the stories I would tell that face. He looks like he's a good listener. 
He looks like a Pixar character, and a good one at that *good boy* *pat pat*
I'm always kind of surprised at how smart they all look, and their emotional intelligence that comes across. What a great-looking dog and so glad he's been claimed 
Nugget 
op...if there are ever any follow up pics- I demand them. I ~~want~~  NEED to see this boy happy with his new forever home.

Bruh he reminds me of Russell from Up. I could just be blind idk. Cute nonetheless. 
Looks like they took his shins.
I want his name to be Bruce. 

He just looks like a Bruce.

"I'm gonna be the goodest boy! "
He looks like the Danny Devito of dogs
I am dying. This dog is so cute. His face is so lovable. I'm so glad he found his forever home. I just want to cradle him and give him snacks. 
This is all the cuteness I needed to get me through the rest of 2017
What a goofie looking dude!

Is he part Bull, part Pit?
so smol, but so thicc
I'm not sure exactly what it is, but There is something about the facial features of this little pup. He looks like a cartoon or a toy.
This dog looks like Ed Asner.
Too bad real jail isn't like that....You have someone in need, someone comes to save them and make their life better. What a cutie, love animals more than humans.
Literally one of the cutest dogs I've ever seen üò≤ 
That's the cutest dog I've ever seen 

Fuck I cried a little bit.

I love him 
He looks like a dog version of an old pot-belly wood burning stove! I love him! 
I can't. I'm waiting to pick up my sugar tomorrow. And whoever adopts this handsome fellow has to name him Stewie because he totally looks like a Stewie. And if he's in California, I'll adopt him too.
He has the sweetest little eyes!! 
I just love his little feets.
Never heard of a dog having down syndrome but this is how I'd picture it. 
He is adorable
Holy shit that's a cute damn doggie!!
I feel like I am his person. And he is my good boy. 
I let out a very audible **AWWWWW** when I saw his face.  Yay...you are a goooood boy!!!
Omg he's so cute! I want him to myself!!! I'd name him Bud üòç
doh, what a silly little fucker
PAHAHAHA AWWWW HES SO WEIRD LOOKING. i just want to love him forever.
I'll bet this dog is an excellent listener.  Those eyes would never show a hint of irritation as you told him all of the tiny things your coworkers did wrong every day. 
This dog looks like Mickey Rooney.

What a cutie
What a cutie.
What kind of frog is this?
He looks like some cute old man waiting at a train station lol
OH MY GOD DID THEY PICK HIM UP YET BECAUSE IM 20 MINUETS AWAY
I am adopting a dog tomorrow. Been to our house and we've visited him twice and walked him twice. I have never been so excited in my life! üêï
I've never met this dog, but I know deep in my soul that his name is Marvin. 
I wanna boop his precious snoot.
Can dogs have downs?
Please someone just give him a top hat and monocle !
Are they taking him home in a Pok√©ball? 
* This is an American Bulldog, not a pitbull.
Got your tuxedo on, waiting for your new family.. I see ya little woofie! 
Pitbull/bulldog mix?


A bullbull?
Looks like he's starting his first day of school!! 
If anyone who is curious about the breed it is a gotti line American bully.  It's Line bred American pitbull terrier and American staffordshire terrier that created this breed.  The are registered under the UKC as American pit bulls but a few years ago they started the ABKC American bully kennel club.  I think bulldog and some other breeds have been bred into them to create this look.  A dog like that would cost no less than $1500 and its rare to see one like that in a shelter.  I volunteer at a dog shelter and I have never seen an American bully at the shelter I volunteer at.  Plenty of pit bulls but never one like this.  

Other styles of American bullies by popularity:

Razors Edge blood line( not as extreme in shortness, more of a built pitbull)
Gotti Line
Toadline(like gotti Line but even more extreme than this)
And there's a ton of other blood lines created by kennels with different looks

They have different categories of American bullies as well:
Extreme(these are large bullies 80-120 pounds)
Standard(like pit bulls)
Pocket bullies(like the dog pictured, smaller around 30-50 pounds)

This is my favorite breed but they catch a lot of flack especially ones like the one pictured because they are bred to be short and extreme.  
Dat fuckers cute, I'd name him Meatball and I would love him.
awwww damit he's cute you can tell he walks from side to side too. 
"I'm a good boy. Yes, I am good. Good boy."
Will they never stop deforming dogs look more like weird messed up humans
He looks like a pitt and English bull dog mix.
English bull dogs usually have a sad life, lots of health issues.
So sad.
Cute otherwise... I guess :(
What a sweet dog
He will be a great snuggler. 
That is an adorable, yoked dog. 
Is that a pitbull bulldog cross?
For a moment i thought that was a mini-pool table.
Wow he has a big ol cartoon head.
We need an after pic once he gets to his forever home.
oh my LORD üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠

i had a really shitty day and this made everything better. üò≠üíú
I wanna hug him so badly!

I'd hug him every time I'd see him.
Ommmmg so squishy and cute!
He is looks voiced by corky, from life goes on... this dog May have downs... 
If this dog talked i wouldn't be shocked.
How can we call this guy?He looks like a character in a movie but I can't remember well.Look at his feet, like a lion gatekeeper which I have seen before.
That is the Danny Devito of dogs 
TIL dog shelter rooms look like mini prison cells.
I also get my pup back from the vet tomorrow after three weeks üò≠
He needs a bow tie.
HE LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE CARTOON PUP
This dog needs a bowtie and a battered old suitcase full of his toys beside him while he waits to get picked up...

... then the shelter could start a bidding war to give him a home. 
Oh I love him
It's like he just came out of a Pixar movie!
Oh the things I would do to boop that snoot
Name him: Sergeant Puppers 
aww. look at this pudding
AWW LOOK AT HIS SPLODGE-Y FACE.

Also, splodge is totally a term that I use to describe dogs like this: Basically dogs who have fat heads, a broad snout, a squishy nose and that cute face to bloody *DIE* for.

I'm so glad he's going to a new family - I hope they treat him right!
I WANT HIM. IM NOT EVEN A FAN OF BULLIES BUT HE IS THE BEST BOY. HE IS A PRIMO PUPPER. 
This is totally Danny devito
He looks like he would pack a dog sized suitcase with his toys and favorite blanket and be waiting patiently in his kennel for them to pick him up. Possible also wearing a little hat and jacket. 
Bullpig
Yes, please. As soon as conveniently possible. Get me out of here and in your living room. Show me where my food is and my water. Intro me to my fam and love me day-in and day-out for the rest of my life. 
"Cute" is a roaring understatement, s/he's ADORABLE!
Is his name Herbert? He looks like a Herbert.
This picture evokes so many feelings in me so bare with me here.. My initial thought was "What the hell is this thing?" because of his unusual appearance, but that thought was followed by immediate guilt, the way he looks at me with sadness in his eyes, it's like he knows he is a freak of nature - he's not supposed to exist according to nature but we created him. And now he's looking at me like "What now?", what am I going to do with him now that he's just sitting there in a cell, completely at my mercy - he knows it, he's not going to try and fight it because that would just be ridiculous, he was bred to be used however we see fit. It's like he's expecting me to discard him because of the way he looks, like what is he really going to be good for? And I just want to hug him and cry and tell him that he's so important, his love is worth more than anything and he will surely make someone happy and be the best thing in their life given the chance.

Maybe this post sound incredibly stupid but I am crying writing it, please take good care of this ugly-cute thing <adoptive family>. He's a good boy. I've come back to look at this picture several times already because of the story those eyes tell.
I demand to be updated about his fate, I want this ball of fur to be absolutely happy!
Why does this dog look like he just got a haircut for his first day of school? 
Dude...that dog's face is ..... human a/f
Damn this breaks my heart. Just thinking of all the puppers and doggos who are in shelters or on the streets. If I ever become rich af I'm buying a fuckton of land and adopting as many doggos as I can. 
He is too precious! I'd give him so many squishy faces and kisses he'd hate my guts 
What a meatball!!
John wick's gonna pick him in his 3rd film's climax. üòÑüòÑ
I will name him George, and I will hug him, and pet him, and squeeze him! Where is this cute little squishy located?
Such a cutie pie with his little mushroom nose and meatball body <3 
He looks like he wants to talk to you about managing your diabetus. 
I live about an hour from Baltimore. Is this dude still available?
He looks like an older gentleman nervous before his first date in 25 years. Good for you getting back out there you handsome dude. 
I need his info üò© I've looked at the animals shelter and can't find him anywhere 
Gah!

I mean he's cute as hell...but that face takes a second or two to get used to. 
Hehehe
HES SOO FAT! I want him
The face of "I could use a hug in the meantime"
B U L K Y B O Y E

look at that patient lil muncher
It's amazing that this blue was adopted! I feel terrible for living it that cell though. Looks identical to jail cells I've slept in. Freedom will put a huge amount of happiness into that dude!
Gaddamn that dog is photogenic as fuck. 
Is there anymore info on this plump little guy??
I want to name him Walrus, Wally for short. 
So excited he forgot to make his bed. 
All he wants to do is drool all over your shit
Can a dog have down syndrome?
Adorable but I am almost positive that this is the result of inbreeding.
Doggo version of Huell from breaking bad
 http://i.imgur.com/zrUJmjJ.jpg 
I don't know dogs could suffer from autism
If this isn't irresponsible cross-breading, I don't know what is. 
That dog is a downy
Hate to break it to you guys but this dog is gonna be, if he isn't already, super unhealthy.I believe it could be what's called an "exotic american bully" which are all generally pretty unhealthy due to the features they are bred to have.
This dog is my soul animal 
üò≠üò≠ He's so ready for his forever family!!! 

LOOK at those lil leggies. Look at his lil face üò≠üò≠
He's the dog version of Russel from UP. 
Is this a pitbull/bull dog mix? It doesnt really matter anyway, hes still the cutest doggo ive ever seen.
If I never got a dog, I would be dead. All I need to say is hopefully he gets a good home!
Needs a bowler hat and a cigar. 
This made my heart so happy! Shelter dogs are amazing companions. I have two rescues myself and I love them like nobody's business. Salute to his new family for saving two dogs (him and the lucky doggo who can now be sheltered in his place).
How is it I can fall in love with just a picture 
Oh man. My heart....it's meltinngggggg
Dogs are just frikin awesome! Can we all agree on that? They're just the best! 
I would take him!!!!!
Is.. is that a little doggie bed?
I like his big head!

He looks like an optimistic italian go-getter immigrinant from the year 1899 who loves cannoli.
Such a sincere face.
Glad to see he has a new home now. He is one of most adorable dogs I've ever seen wow

Precious big boy, hope he finds a home soon. 
I like his white patch chest. Looks very cool 
Pure love.  Makes me happy seeing that look of anticipation.

Dog, God spelled backwards. A spirit of one in the same.

His face looks just like Wilford Brimley!
Is it just me or does that look like a mini jail
He is an adorable boy! He needs some head pats!
THICC

Why do I see him in an animated film with a New York accent? 
Wow!! 
How cute....I wanna adopt it and wanna hug.
"Can we get the fuck outta here?"
Is that one of those miniature snooker tables?
What a little fucker. Ive never seen a dumb so cute. I want
Idk why, but I thought about Danny Devito the second I glanced at this picture.
What is it about puppy's like labs and bulldogs that have loose skin makes them look old and young at the same time. 
If anyone wants to know what happens when a staffy puts the moves on a bulldog....here you go. :)
He is a nice guy... Looking cool 
Live well pupper
This dog looks like Seamus Finnigan
Cute
I want to squeeze him! 
I just want to cuddle him literally like all day as much as possible..
What sweet little guy. 
Looks very innocent.. 
WHAT. A. GOOD. BOY.
He looks like a little business man during an interview aaAAAH THAT'S SO ADORABLE 
He looks like an actor I've seen all my life but for the life of me I can't recall who I'm thinking of
Albert
I would name him Immortan Joe Jr. Because he is perfect in every way. 
This dog is a potato.
I love him.
Please pick him up 
I really hope his owners know how lucky they are 
O hai doggo, what do you do for a living? "I wrestle rabid bears and crocodiles and I catch butterflies." 
Bobby Hill?
Him so cute. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
He's got the same eyes as Mac from It's Always Sunny. 
He' so cute but my parents disallow to give dog to feed. TT
I think my heart just melted...
Aww wow I want him the cutest dog ever 
Jack Black is lookin good
I have looked at this dog for like 5 minutes and for the life of me can't figure out why he is soooo cute. Someone help!
That's an Alfred if ever I saw one... 
This picture made my heart melt
w i d e b o y e
Oh my Christ on a cracker

If new family doesnt show... he's mine! üòçüòçüòç
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDDING ME!? THIS DOG IS MY LIFE NOW
holy fuck he is adorable! a staffy cross bulldog i reckon
Stuff like this is what words like 'flumposaurus' 'flumpty plump' or 'flooperbum' were made for. 
That is seriously one of the most adorable faces I have ever seen. What a wonderful thing to see that dog every day!
I would if I could honestly saying
Ahhhh I want him. Such a cutie 
I bet someone else has already commented that, but I think this little guy really looks like Jack Black. 
You're a loose cannon Poochinski!  But you're a damn good cop.
Awww looks like he's in jail poor thing
Who is the the best boy?!? 
He looks nervous. Made me tear up a little.
Nice try Danny Devito
I love him so much 
I'd call him The General and give him a dog pillow made of purple velvet to sleep on.
I want to squish him because he's the goodest good boy!!
Real life pokemon
This dog needs a mustache and a gun holster to be complete!
I wanna give this little guy a hug soooo much 
Ommmmmg little meat wagon. <3
It hurts me that we have bred so many dog breeds to end up looking like this... A lot of people find it cute, but it's a result of inbreeding and has absolutely no benefits, only problems.

I hope this little guy has a long and happy life.
He looks like a Frank.
I didn't know Danny Devito was being adopted! Good for him!
Want!
I‚Äôd name him Chiggly Wiggly
What is a dog that is wider then he is tall :)
"little guy" is broader than me.
Looks like Karl Pilkington
Cute lil fat boy he looks harmless üòç
He looks like Wilford Brimley. Dogebeetus.
I'm on my way

His face says "I hope they come, I have forever love to give!"
He looks like he's in a doggie dorm. And looking back sad and nervous about doggie college.
That looks like a prison. Concrete walls, cot, and a bucket for a sink.
Used to be in love with my ex's bully...until he bit me in the calf out of nowhere. 
Forget about looking like the dog from Up, this dog looks like the kid from Up!
I double tapped the shit out of this doggo.  Fuckin' IG brainwashing. 
Those cute little ears and cheeks are just begging to be touched. Suck a cutie.
Good luck sweet Pibble!! May you receive lots of schmackos, boops, and scratches
HE'S AT THE SHELTER I WORK AT
WHAAAAT! Is it photoshoped?? :D :D Can't stop laughing! Poor doggo! I would love to adopt him! :)
Looks like he benches 405 for a warm up
Jeez looks like prison 
Is this like an english bulldog and a pit mix?
He looks like Danny DeVito.
He is small, a little overweight and very insecure right now. But when you have him a warm welcome he'll be very proud and comfortable. I like him. He's like me

Edit: I just realized how uncomfortable his bed looks. Room looks like a fucking jail cell.

I think there are some legit reasons to bring a pet to the shelter? But everyone who's like "oh today I want a Doggo" and next year you gonna bring him in the shelter because you didn't figure out how much work it is... Such people.... Arghhhh. 

OP is one of the good guys. One of us.
My soul animal **crying**
Were you his new family ? :))))
If I could have another dog, he'd be it.
He looks like Wilford Brimley.
You have to get him bro!
Omg. 
Way to cute, i wish i could pick him up right now
He's giving that face when you see someone you know but you don't want to say anything right before you give a tiny nod 
Awe he's such a cutie. He's going to look intimidating when he gets older but he's just so friendly.
I imagine him sounding like the Geico gecko. 
I'LL BE HIS NEW FAMILY PICK ME!!!
The best meatball 
He looks mildly disappointed with me. I don't know how he knows he should be disappointed with me, but he's justified I guess
the best boy 
where is he located?! I need him 

Okay so was he adopted or is this new family sorta like...a code word for, "SOMEONE PLEASE DRIVE TO WHEREVER THIS DOG IS AND ADOPT HIM" because I'm picking up what you're throwing down, if so.
Where?! Is he still waiting?!
This is so cute I'm like ready to cry 
I. Am. In. Love. This Good Boy is too too much!! 

*squee*
I need him in my life, for real. If he hasn't been adopted, can you get me details?
They do a great job of making that look like a prison.
Short wide and soooooo cute!!
This needs to become a breed. 
Awww...he looks like a little fur tater! What a sweet, sweet face :)
WHY IS HE SO CUTE!!!!!!!????
Awww, he's so cute. Hope he'll be happy with a new family
Adorable. Nothing else to say. I hope he has a great happy life. :)
This looks like dogo prison, he's in a poc cell. 
He's not little.
English Bulldog and Pitt Bull? 
Hopefully some nice family picked out that beautiful looking dog 
He really reminds me of a frog tbh 
I'll pick him up right now drop the address 
I'LL TAKE HIM
/u/SaffronTomato

Nonies in a couple years
Handsome gent
I would name him Buster. 
Where is it, and has it been adopted yet?!
This looks like one of the Toad Line bullies. Poor lil sucker is probs inbred AF and the discarded result of breeding dogs for looks and cash and not health. His little gaze is pretty cute though.
I want em, adoptable in California by any chance?
Looks exactly like the doggo from Tom and Jerry
Can I be his new family? üò≠
Looks like he just got out of a tiny prison

I hope they have strong backs.  That little guy looks like a brick with legs.
I would love to see the reaction video of his family getting him=
Adorable -_-
Looking anxious and a good boye at the same time. 
Had this nugget been adopted yet?

DAMMIT NO I WANT HIM
I would love a follow-up pic when the family arrived.. Look at that big ball.. 
why is this dog so dapper
I cannot wait to see his journey in his forever home.  I have a feeling he'll have quite a following.
He looks like a Pok√©mon 
Wait this is at Stone Mountain Pet Lodge! I know this place!
This is a fucking cute dog.
He is so adorable, where is he located?
He is so adorable, where is he located?
Thicc boi
Please tell me some has adopted this sad little guy.
I want pics of this doggo every day.  Could be a famous one
Holy shit he is cute
He he it looks like photo was squashed.
It literally looks like it has Down syndrome. Before anyone kills me, I'm just making an observation, not trying to be rude or offend anyone. 
Does anyone know if he's been adopted?
For some reason this dog's look speaks to me. I imagine he acts exactly how he looks. You bring him home and quickly learn he doesn't like to run much, he's not a very active dog. He likes to sit, sometimes staring out the window but mostly staring at you. You'll bring him for walks and he'll just stay close to you for most of it. When you take him off the leash he finds a good place to sit and then just watches the rest of the dogs play with their human partners, until he looks at you and you know he's telling you "time to go home."

Eventually you give him the name Sitter, only realizing at this point in time that you never really named him. He always knew what needed to be done next, whether it was go for a walk or poop outside.

As the years go by, he continues to live up to his name: sitting there and watching. Watches you live your life, get a romantic partner, split up. Move for a new job.

He is always there, by your side, usually sitting in the corner. Always watching. Eventually you get married and have a kid on the way. It's been a long time since you got Sitter. Nowadays he doesn't move around as much, but his masterful sitting is still a constant in your life. Your spouse isn't sure what to make of him, but since he's docile they don't mind.

As the months roll by you can tell he's getting older and older. A little less responsive, a little slower to eat from his food bowl. Eventually you realize he's on his last legs and you take time out of your schedule to be with him, joining him for his favourite activity: sitting.

You look over at him, and he looks back at you. "This was a reasonable enough life I guess" he says. Shocked, you can only watch him close his eyes slowly, and you know he has passed. Still sitting, forever sitting.
3 deaths in the last three weeks by pit bulls. The breed is faulty and needs to be wiped out.
I call this new breed a "Pittywog".
Poor breeding choices
T H I C C
Who in their right mind would want to breed dogs that look like that? 
THANK YOU NEW FAMILY 
ADOPT DONT SHOP 
hey, please no swearing on my christian server
It's rather depressing when you think of all the animals like this that didn't get their second chance due to laziness/lack of caring of other kill-shelters.  

For all the bs SJW shit social media brings, this type of situation is definitely one of its best aspects.
This dog looks like he's got Downs Syndrome 
I don't want to be an asshole, but that is one ugly dog!
What an adorable little goober! I think he might be qualified for one of those dedicated instagram/youtube channels
Worried looking
He looks like a toy
That dog needs his own Instagram account.
Precious lil pudge pile!
God bless him. I hope his life henceforth is happy.
Holy shit, I've never seen a pupper this adorable. Made my day! 
Is that an English bull dog mixed with a pit terrier?
is that a Pit Bulldog?
He will be a great snuggler. 
"Little"
Aww.  Sweetie.  So happy for him!

Tom and Jerry 
His name is Stubs, right?
Looks like that sad monster dog from The Evolution movie.
Oh my god- he needs a name like Egbert or Samuelson. He looks just like a little butler!
This dog looks like Whitey from One Tree Hill.
"...am I going home?"

what a fantastic looking dog, all the snuggles, he gets all of them
this dude has so much character in his face, it's amazing.  
Little probably wouldn't be a word I would use to describe him, but I get what you're trying to say
why do i feel like i know him and what he would sound like if he could speak
Awwwwww he's so chubby and sad. I just want to squeeze him. üíñ
This pup is built like Spike from Tom and Jerry. Look at its chest. It probably wears a XL shirt.
I love him...
It's like he knows unwanted dogs go to sleep. 
It's Chuckie from shameless
cute little chunk
AAAAAAAAA SO COOT

He's adorable! 
Cuddly but muscular! like a Wombat
OP is this a Seattle area humane society? Been there so often just to meet the doggos that I recognize the beds and their enclosure.
Oh my goodness! Lookit that face!! He's all like, "Yup yup, got me some peoples now."

Glad he got adopted out. He looks like someone made a squished chibi version of a pitbull LOL
He looks like a real life version of someone resizing an image without locking the aspect ratio. 
Ummmmm I love him. 
Haha! Hey buddy!
I am getting a strong [Richard Kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Kind#/media/File:Richard_Kind_at_the_2010_Independent_Spirit_Awards.jpg) vibe here.

Reddit's making dogs dissappear again if you know what I mean
Hopefully he goes to a good home.

Looks like he could pass for [my boy's](http://imgur.com/a/9fmZQ) uncle!

He reminds me of Costanza

Huwwy uph!

OMG! That cute doggo face.

Those are the most stenotic nares I've ever seen.  Looks to be one of those pocket bullies.  Cute guy, hope he ends up healthy.
Squat little dude isn't he?
I feel like I will cry if I keep looking at this picture. Why can't we live in a world where all dogs have homes and owners :(

B-Bobby? What the hell are you doing putting your face on a dog?
Cutie pieüòò
teared up 
This room looks like a scaled down prison cell, and he looks like he's not sure why he's there but he's doing alright. 
He's so cute, I CAN'T TAKE IT. 

One of my dogs was such a unique looking dog, my boyfriend saw her hiding in the back at the shelter and asked to meet with her. 5mins later she was going home with us.
Yes Sir, ready to go Sir!
He looks just like a stray that got brought into my work! I wanted to take him home soooooo bad but my puppy hasn't been vaccinated so I had to resist no matter how awful it was to leave him to the god damn shelter. (I love the shelter for what they do, but i would have rather had him) 
He's too adorable,  I love his eyes.  So glad to know he has a forever home and now is the proud owner of some humans. 
This is CeeLo Green in dog form. Highly approve.
Some how he looks like he's had a hard life, can't wait for him to join his new family 
A very sturdy young man
I've never commented on one of this things but this is the cutest fucking dog I have ever seen. 
awwww baby, I'd take you in a second omg üò≠üò±
Looks kind of like Danny DeVito to me...
Those eyes. 
Rescue dogs are the happiest dogs!

Hope they treat him well everyday and night. Because it has to be love that they feel.

"Do you think they'll mind all my slobber...? :< " 
What a good boy 
He was in a shelter!!!! Wow someone just walked into a small fortune 
He looks like Chinese man.
The feeling in his eyes is enough to make anyone cry.
Saul goodman

Naming him anything other than Gristle would be a crime
That is a very stout dog, I love him.
I don't know much about dogs..... but isn't this one of those new mini pocket pitbull breeds that are all the rage now?  Aren't these like $1000+ boutique dogs?  How does a healthy looking one of these end up needing to be given away in a shelter?
Where are my testicles, Summer?

I might be crazy, but this dog looks like he borrowed a few bones from Crazy "Connie" Chihuahua and is desperate to get out before she catches up with him for what he owes.

His face looks like when you use the camera filter where you split it down the middle so you get two sides of your face that are exactly the same
