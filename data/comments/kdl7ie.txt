wait so youre that meme, where it goes "dad doesnt want dog but family gets dog anyways. dad and the dog:"
OP is an absolute liar....his username clearly says he’s 12 years old! 

(Great photo, amazing dog, enjoy the love!)
Do you have one of those mythical doggos that stays still longer than 2 seconds.  Beautiful
Let your kids make more decisions for you, this one was exceptionally good
Beautiful pup.  What breed?
Doodles are great dogs but they require a lot of upkeep and maintenance :) expect to be bringing penny to the groomer once a month, and doing regular brushing at home.

Their mixed coat means that it tangles quiet easily, and if left unchecked for a long period of time, it can be very uncomfortable and even damaging.

Make sure to start miss penny with brushing and baths early on so she enjoys these things, rather than being scared of them! Doodles who are taught about grooming early in life just LOVE being pampered and brushed!
She’s very beautiful !!!🥰
holy crap what did you take this photo on?
There’s no going back.
From the looks of it you're more of a teddy bear guy 😄

Are you the "dad didnt want a dog/dad now" guy irl?
Shelled out the $$$ for this one
Dogs are the best!! Have fun!
r/dadswhodidntwantpets
That’s no dog. That’s a goddamn model
I'm 34 and just got my first dog last year. Absolute game changer. I had no idea how child like and inquisitive they are. Receptive and please seeking.

My wife got me a corgi after me saying no like 30 times, no I catch myself mumbling his name as I drift off to sleep. He cuddles up next to me.

What really sold me is when I took him out free walking and basically thought "OK dude, go where ever and I'll just make sure you don't get in trouble." He took me straight to the spot where we occasionally run and play chase, hopped on my leg and let out a small bark. (tag you're it) I'm fucking sold dude. So many wasted years without that kind of treasure in my life. It's unreal, like a symbiotic relationship and best friend rolled into a cute furry package.
I love dogs, they are great. But I've always told my family I never want a dog. I find that they are just too much of a time commitment and after seeing how things go with the cat,  I know that none of them really want to spend the time necessary to raise a dog properly. I don't have the free time to devote to the dog, at least not without giving up other things I want to do with my time.

Beautiful dog though, hope he has a long and happy life with your family.
Same here. Preparing to get a second one from a shelter.
what camera? gorgeous dog and pic!
We tried for so long to get a dog but my dad would always say no. Now, 1 year into his retirement and when everyone has left the house, he gets a dog.  Yesterday the dog ate his phone. That puppy is still his best friend.
Great picture and cute dog!
Had a doodle dog. His head was stuffed with cotton balls. He would go on barking fits at ghosts. The groomers would charge extra, for his thick and tangled coat. But he had big brown puppy dog eyes. And would never let you be, alone...
That’s a good looking dog.
This is a wonderful pict!
What a beauty!
Good lord what was this picture taken with? (Other than love of course because this doggo is gorgeous)
Enjoy the journey!  My guy turns 15 today and I'm anxious about the time we have left.  It does go by fast, but they're so worth it.🐾
This is one of those pictures that is so good it looks fake somehow.
Also a photography guy by the looks of it! Great photo.
Welcome to the club!  Discovered this later too at 50!
Also a photographery guy lol crispy
I think you're a photography guy too. Nice lense. 👍
Why are people so against dogs I'll never understand
Purebreds are easier but I dont know how anyone can buy a dog in good conscience when you know thousands of them are about to get euthanized. how can you do that? Either way, doesnt make you a bad person per se, just at least donate to a shelter to make it up. They need it.
Absolutely gorgeous photo. We just got our first dog too! Congrats and welcome to the club!
You are one of us now. Welcome
Welcome to the club
That is one of the sweetest pics  I will see today of a cute doggie face.  Thanks!!
That is a fucking beautiful dog
Took you long enough.
Gorgeous color!!
Congratulations! Your dog is beautiful :)
What a handsome fella
Ayyyyyyy #doodlegang
Not only is that dog adorable, you are a great photographer! Gorgeous photo!
That is a very good piece of fried chicken.
Oh I was always a cat guy until I met a couple dogs who would always just give me cuddles and be so excited to see them - I miss them!!
r/dadswhodidnotwantpets
That dog looks like a really good pile of fried chicken.
r/dadswhodidntwantdogs
This is the way.
We just got a mini golden doodle and named him Kobe! He’s like 10 weeks now 😂
That's one majestic looking pupper!
They're the absolute *best*. Your life will never be the same, in the best possible way.
It starts with one then many more
How to become dog person, just get dog, that's it
Great image!
Great picture of an adorable pup. Congrats on your new family member!!
OP, I think you might have been mis-sold; that's sentient fried chicken!
What breed is this type of dog?
You're a handsome dog guy... But how did you cram yourself in such a tiny suit?
r/Dogue material
Tale as old as time, dad likes photography - dad doesn't want dog - kids force dad to get a dog - dad ends up with 80Gb of dog photos because he has a new photogenic best friend
And that’s a fantastic photograph of a really great face - wow!
That's a really beautiful doggo.  Glad you came around.
My dog is identical apart from having black fur
ITS A CHRISTMAS DOG 🐕🐕🐕
Seems like you are a camera guy first and foremost
You always were a dog guy.  Now you know.
How did you not have a dog? Do you listen to a lot of Phil Collins? How do you feel about S-s-sudio?
A dog guy who knows how to take an awesome photo!
Bruh he looks exactly like my dog, is he a mini goldendoodle
You are a hooman! Not a dog guy
I’m just here to comment on what a great pet portrait this is. Lighting. Everything.
I always say, there are dog people, and there are people who don’t know they’re dog people.
wht a handsome face holy shit
What a beautiful puppy!
He is gorgeous!
He looks like a model
That’s the picture quality I only see in Apple commercials
I swear to god if that dog’s name isn’t Corduroy I’m going to riot. He’s a spitting image.
Wait is the dog also the dad
Dooooodlel nugget!!!
That dog is so photogenic it looks fake! Great lighting too
Nice cat
Looks like you’re a camera guy as well! Amazing picture of a beautiful dog
“SomeTweleveYearOld”
And a camera guy, apparently
Dad: *doesn’t want dog*
*kids convince to get dog*
Dad and dog^^^
Dog groomer here! You have a beautiful puppy and I hope it brings you and your family years of happiness and fun times! Since it’s your first time owning a dog, watch some videos on how to care for your dogs coat. Their hair grows like weeds, and without regular grooming (professional grooming once a month, brushing at least a few times a week at home) their hair will be matted and clumpy, and the only way to fix that is to shave it lol. Just want to give you a heads up so you can avoid disaster in the future :)
Don't be surprised if you end up loving that dog more than your kids.

Just sayin... 😂

All kidding aside, our dog is without a doubt the best thing that has ever happened to my wife and I. He is the best friend we've ever had and we can't imagine a life without him in it. I tell him that I love him no less than 30 or 40 times/day.

We don't have any kids yet but we're planning to have one. I always joke with her that I'll never love our kid as much as I love him.
I thought it was a high end stuffed animal honestly. I guess just a good looking dog and a great photog.
Are you also a photography guy? Great photo!
Forbidden fried chicken
That’s so sweet😚🙈
I’m so got damn happy for you!! Congratulations, you’ll never turn back.
That is one photogenic pupper.

What a beautiful little pupper 😍
Welcome to the party, happened to me last year age 37.

Check out the puppy101 subreddit, it saved my life.
I'm so happy for you!!!
You look very cute for a furry
And what a beautiful doggo that is!
That's a good looking pup.  Congrats, Dog Dad.
I wasn’t a real person until a certain dog stepped up and taught me how to be one.
One of us. One of us.
Very very sweet. Happy for you guys!  

My dad was the same, he resisted for nearly 20 years (for good reason) and one day gave in. He was pouty even on the way home from adopting our puppy. By that night, he started getting attached (slept on the floor next to the puppy so he wouldn't be scared) and by the next day, he was absolutely in love. He constantly remarks about how similar he is to me and my brother when we were babies. I often catch him cradling him like a baby. We often note that our puppy smells like my dad's hand lotion because he can't stop petting him! My dad loves being a dad and he's allowed our dad to walk down memory lane again :)
You think you are hooked now just wait you ain’t seen nothing yet
Thank you for gelling the light ;)
Wait your 43 and that's your username?
This  twelve year old is 43 ?
"I'm 43, never had a dog"

The fates have been cruel to this man.
You might enjoy this article then.

Wow what pretty dog. I love the color and curls of his/he's fur.
tbh you kinda look like a dog bro
My dad didn't want a dog. We adopted one on the condition that I would take care of it and now he baby talks to it and sneaks him human food and calls for me to look when he pets it
I mean, even the Grinch had a dog. 🤷‍♀️ Congrats. He or she is adorable.
Same here, finally got a dog because of kids and now I wonder how can someone live without this cute little love..
Same but a mom
You’re 43. Your username comes off weirder now.
all animals/pets are precious if you invest the right amount of time and love into them. i've turned ppl into dog & cat ppl with very little effort, knowing they would benefit from a non-human friend for life. wishing you and the new pup a great life together! gorgeous little thing!
wow this picture got 117 thousand likes in 16 hours, wow
Photographer too?
Thats a pretty, pretty dog!
I can't because I don't wanna take any responsibility beside myself.
Oh my goodness what a sweet dog and a beautiful photo
Congratulations 🎉! What breed is it?
Good dad
What a gorgeous little puppy!  I'm sure he's not going to be spoiled at all. :)
Better late than never!!♥️
With that face looking at you, how could you not be?
AWWW..... that is sooo cute!
Doggo is adorable.
I’m 43 and got my first dog this year too!
this animal with enrich your life and you should enrich his. 

cheers!
so cute!!
So cute 😍
That’s not a dog
I believe all humans have the potential to ascend to the dog master race!
Its just looking like a doll... Very cute and who doesn't likes dogs if they are so cute like this

much appreciated mate, lovely [https://petcare4all.com/dogs/eat-dogs/can-dogs-eat-mayo/](https://petcare4all.com/dogs/eat-dogs/can-dogs-eat-mayo/)
You were always a dog guy — it just took the right dog to make you realize it.
What an adorable pup!
It might have been a good lesson for your kids to adopt a dog from a shelter instead of buying a purebred.
Adopt, don't shop.
Congratulations! Don't ever hit it. Hands are not for hitting. I was training my dog as a a therapy dog. I lost my temper once and swatted her. Set our training back six months. It took 6 months to regain her trust. That incident shaped me as a parent and I never hit my children.
I’m guessing this one didnt come from a shelter.  Tons of pups out there needing homes.  I hope folks consider checking out the shelters first before anything else.
Adopt don't shop!!
Too bad you didn’t adopt.
I’m in the same boat! 40 years old with my first dog. She even looks similar. She’s a  10 month old golden doodle and I could not be happier. It has me wondering why I waited so long.
[everyone liked that]
Everyone needs a dog
Wow, absolutely stunning dog
Sir, with all due respect, are you sure that's not just a very realistic stuffed plush toy? Are you sure the kids arent playing an elaborate prank on you? Do the legs move? Has it pooped in a shoe? Have you had to get a second job to pay for vet and food bills? Looks just a wee bit too perfect to me. Jk/ Very cute little guy. Have fun!
People always say that: "Oh I don't like dogs!" or "I hate cats!" But then they get a dog (or cat, respectively) and then they love their pets so much.
Every dad who doesn’t want a dog be like
Ah yes.... "compromise"..
That dog is practically made for snuggling. Get to it!
Um, dogs are the best, where the heck have you been?
Wow that is a handsome dog. There is a soul in those eyes...
Boomer, oh wait you were born 1977 never mind
Don't believe you. You look very "dog" in the pic.
Holy shit yes!!! You deserve this dog my friend.
A dog daddy, if you will
I missed the ‘guy’ bit of the title initially. Now I’m slightly disappointed
Gorgeous color
Every man is a dog guy, some of them just haven't realised it yet.

Beautiful doggo BTW, looks very photogenic and cuddly.
Lol I kind of did the same to my dad except I adopted a cat at university and brought her home over Thanksgiving. He’s always “hated” cats but for some reason he really loves ours. 

Your dog is precious, lol I’m jealous!
You're the dad from the dad and the dog memes
AWWWW. What a sweetheart! What's puppers name?
OMG so amazingly adorable!
Dad doesnt want a dog.
Dad with the dog:
My condolences.
Beautiful boi!
I now have a craving for fried chicken, thx.
Probably helps it’s adorable
It’s funny but the only thing separating dog people from not dog people is simply never having one. I grew up afraid of them and one day there was one in my house and I have loved all dogs ever since.
That's just a *picture* of a dog.
Good you share this on reddit he is so cute you made my day thank you
Can confirm... Am a dad...didn't want a dog either... Now I hate how much I love him.
Smartest thing you ever did, they love you no matter what, the only thing they want is your attention. Enjoy
And you got the most adorable dog around
You have a smart kid, and a beautiful dog!
10/10 best dad. I always remember my first animal companion. Cherish this moment. It’s going to be a wonderful time!
What a beaut
Aww! This is a stunning picture!
photogenic doggo
Oh he/she is just GORGEOUS! My husband and I cannot wait to get a dog.. as soon as one of us is confirmed full time wfh we will do it!
Look at his username lmao
That's because every Guy is a dog Guy they are Man's best friend.
Always a sucker for a redhead.
The one damn good photo!
Your dog looks like it’s CGI and it’s really throwing my brain for a loop lol
first time I see the dad &pet meme from the dad's perspective
I wish I could talk my dad into getting a dog. :(
What a beautiful dog.
What camera did you use? Looks really good quality
You got a supermodel pup.
Username doesn’t check out...
Hold the phone. What kind of dog is that?!?! It’s so cuuuuute!
What does your dog look like?
The thing about dogs is you won't get that kind of love and loyalty from anything else.....you want to experience true love.....get a dog.....they are added work but it all benefits you.
Hes cute
Dogs are one of the last pure things left here on the planet. True story
Hasn’t chewed up your favorite shoe yet, eh?
Yesssss. Best gift you can give your kids!
Congrats, he looks like a special boy.... or girl.  Welcome to the club dog guy. "Dogs are better people, than people."
Omg! It looks like the puppy I’m babysitting for a family friend!
What’s the dog’s name? Please tell me it’s something like Ted. Such a beautiful pup.
(And I’m also in the position of never having had a dog, so I saw your post as “there’s still time!” too)
There's a subreddit for people like you.
so cute oh my GODDDDD
You sure look like a dog guy.
This dog is god damn handsome.
[DOGGO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ&ab_channel=RickAstleyVEVO)
I have a dog of similar breed, similar eyes. These eyes tell you nothing but love and loyalty, from the beginning til the end. They are so amazing.
Omg!! So cute!!!!
Fried chicken pupper
I'm 32 and never had a dog either. I've always wanted one but could never due to small apartments and my rent would go up which I can't afford right now.
That sweetie looks like lil nugget
Seems like you’re a dog photographer guy.  That’s a great photo.
Take a cat much better!
Also apparently a camera guy. Gorgeous dog, gorgeous picture.
Why is this dog so popular? Is it the looks?
Sort of similar boat. Fiancee wanted a puppy. I'm so worried we won't take care of it properly with obedience training but in 2 days we'll find out!
If that’s your dog, of course you’re going to be a dog guy. 

Sheesh.
ITT: Unsolicited grooming advice. The curse of owning a doodle.
Everyone's a dog person. Some people are just still in denial. Enjoy your beautiful new best friend!
And a professional photographer apparently
my dream doggo :))
This is the way
is he a snickerdoodle?
Soon to be number one child.  Kids will say you prefer the dog more than them.  You will also joke that if you got the dog before having kids you'd have second thoughts about having kids.
The quality of that image 🤌
Nice
That's a doll
Awww
My husband was taken aback when one of my errands involved picking up a dog. He grew up with cats. A few years later he repaid me by convincing me to agree to foster a cat who we adopted a few days later. 

We did talk about it so we knew what we were getting into.
Omg!
I just got my first puppy at 41 this past weekend! It’s so amazing, isn’t it? Congratulations!! He/she is adorable
Wow! Precious ❤️

I was 33 before my family talked me into it and now my boy needs a buddy.... and before I was incredibly anti dog. Didn’t even want to be near them.

Excellent. A newbie added to our ranks. Bwahaahaa. It starts with one dog, then the dog needs a friend....

But seriously, congrats. He’s adorable.
Now that’s a real smart dogs face if I ever seen one!
So cute.!!!
Dogs fill a natural hole as we started co-evolving with them over 25000 years ago.
I thought the dog is 43 yr old and was like "damn that dog didn't age at all, still looks like a puppy" until I read the rest of the caption xD
Aww he's so cute!
Goldendooooole
I’m sorry sir. You did not get a dog. What you have here is in fact an angel muppet.
Hypoallergenic dog too! I didn't know they come in brown!
Sir, that is a teddy bear.
I love to see this. My step dad was never a dog person, but after he married my mom who has never not had less than 2 dogs in her life, and by extension mine, he fell in love with our dogs.
Chicken nugget
Who wouldn't be when a real life teddy bear loves you.
This photo is soooooo good. Is a phone camera?

The hound is so cute!
Hes so handsome
Absolutely adorable:)
I love you
You’ve upgraded to a different level of dog dad with this quality photo
Hey, me too. I'm 42, and I've always had dogs. But this year a cat showed up at my door and insisted on being my cat, so I have a cat now.
You also went the smart way with the Doodle mix, no shedding to deal with. U lucky bastard
Ah, yes. The natural sequence.
1. Not a dog person
2. Meets dog
3. Dog stuff happens
4. Dog person
Welcome to the club!
Whosagoodboy
I love your dog, to bad I can’t have dogs in the house though cause my parents are allergic
How can anyone NOT be a dog person when they look at that little guy?!
> *now I'm a dog guy.*

##ANIMORPHS!
What a beautiful dog
That's a cat. Too Small to be a real dog in Ron Swanson's opinion. The good thing is that your a cat guy.
One of us, one of us.
OMG - what a beauty!
Wise choice, my friend. You’ll never go back.
One of us. One of us. Gooble gobble, one of us!
Awesome pic looks like a movie
Dads always are
So cute.
Are you a dog guy or is he guy dog?
Are u 43 years old  or  some 12 year old? 😂
How did they talk you into it?
Aww, they look like a teddy bear! It’s so cute!
Im a dooooooooooooog guuuy.

*Woof*
Aren't they awesome? Congratulations.
Funny how that always seems to happen.
Hello dog guy
Stick with it. The true test is being there for them in the unconditional way that they will be for you, through time and challenges.
This has literally happened to my dad
this dog is made of John Stamos hair
I feel like I’m too broke to even look at this pup
Pog
That's a beautiful dog! Always been a dog guy but I don't recognise that one. What breed/ breeds is it?
I always thought i was a cat person, turned out im a dog guy too.
I just cant get enough of Shih tzu's personality.
Aw im sad now and i miss my Bella.
Your dog should be named Memorex!
Cute dog!
Welcome to the *I dont want a dog* parent crew who now loves said dog.

Edit: from dad to parent because you might not be a dad...
Very nas- Borat

What a cute pup.
Our Irish doodle looks identical! Did you get him in Pelham, NC?
This is a beautiful dog right here
Same thing happened to me at 42, best choice I made in awhile.
Sir, I like your mop
[removed]
Congrats on becoming a dog!
Congrats! You’re gonna love it!!
And apparently a photographer. Nice pic.
Congratulations on your first dog-child! God and he is a cutie! ❤
My initial thought was “ah yes, a dog guy, a guy dog hybrid. This must be a picture of him after he became a dog” and I don’t know why that popped into my head
Very photogenic pup!
Congrats, you now have one more kid!
PUPPY
Wow ... that's a good looking dog
Why, sir, you've *always* been a dog guy.
If that’s a golden-doodle you’re gonna have to train the hell out of it. They’re very naughty.
Good For You..
Easy Breezy Beautiful
So beautiful!!
They make life more enjoyable.   I know that sounds obvious, but truly it’s surreal how much better a dog can make you feel after a brutal day.
Is teddy bear puppy! 😍 eeeeee!
Dang. You turned in to a dog? Was the transformations ruff on you?  I’ve never heard of someone getting a dog and then turning in to one
🔥🔥🔥 he looks like a good boy
It helps that he's fucking adorable at least
I’m 43, never played video games. My kids talked me into it now I’m a population one VR guy. See you on the battlefield
OHMYDOG
TBF it’s kind of cheating, giving you a dog like that.
dog is love
awesome
I’m 63. I counted and there has been four months total in my life that I haven’t had a dog. I’ve never known life with out a pooch. It’s a good time to have a dog my friend. Welcome to the club, what took you so long?
Easy Breezy So Beautiful  😍
Is no one going to mention the fact that this dude turned himself into a dog for his kids?
Did they promise to walk and feed it everyday? Because that was a fib.
If you didn’t become a dog guy after seeing this face I would be worried about you.
They steal your heart and your food is next
How did you light it? Looks great.
You mean a better person. Not a dog person, now you're just a better person.
Hi a Dog guy, I’m Dad
Omg so cute!!
That adorable puppy might make me crossover from being a crazy cat lady to a dog Mom.
Your life just got shit loads better. Congrats.
I love him 🥺
It happens.
I had dogs as a kid, but I never realized the real meaning of "man's best friend" until I got my own as an adult
I bet you don’t regret stepping out of your comfort zone!
I want to know the make and model of that sweet camera setup.
I got my first dog at 35, best freaking decision of my life.  Congrats on becoming a dog guy!!  One of the best friends you will ever have, cutest too!
Is that a Irish doodle?
This is why you have kids
Cute
That’s a stuffed animal
Welcome :)
Welcome :)
WHERE IS EVERYONE GETTING THESE CAMERAS?!
The quality of that picture though
Never too late to get yourself a "best" friend
Who wouldn’t be with that beauty!!
Me and my brothers talked my parents into getting one also lmao
Yea but that’s a stuffed animal tho
That’s some good camera work
This will now be your favorite child.
You waited this long 😡
Beautiful photo but that is clearly a stuffed animal that I absolutely want to cuddle with for a while.
It's only the beginning - I never had a dog until I was almost 40, and now I volunteer at a shelter.
But it's a small prissy dog.. :/
Welcome to the club!!
Sooooo cute :) I love the color too, it's like my own hair haha
ooh a golden doodle right?
I’ve melted, send help
can someone photoshop in an action movie explosion behind him?
Good lookin hound
Congratulations on your metamorphosis! You look great! I’m also rather impressed you kept your ability to type as a dog/guy.
Im in love awww
Dad also seems to be into photography! Thats a really nice picture of your doggo!
I wonder if ours are from the same litter. We just picked up our little red dog last week.
Same thing happened to my dad. Scared of dogs his whole life until Copernicus came into his life. Now all dogs are good. Cats are evil.
Dogs are great and you picked a great “breed” labordoodles are very smart.
What camera do you have?
ฅˁ･ꀾ･ˀฅ
Beautiful!
40. Same. Rescued a pit mix and she’s had me wrapped around her little finger since the first day.
Dawwwww! Look at that face!
This is the George Clooney of puppies 😍
who wouldn’t be a dog guy with a beauty like that one
Never too late to get yourself a "best" friend
Those things have a SHITLOAD of energy. They look cute when they're puppies though.

I know my parents regret buying their laberdoodle, goldendoodle, whatever kind of cutsie name you can come up with.
It’s the paws for me
No living thing will ever love you so unconditionally. Dogs are incredible.  Just the best creatures.
Everybody is a dog person, they just haven't met the right dog yet.
Dog is cute as hell. What kind of camera do you use?
Cutie pie
How you doing with training?
D'aww 🐶
Congrats! It’s lots of work but they are blessings!
My parents never had a dog - mom was scared of them cause in Asia - most are street dogs and she's been attacked/harassed.  Now my dog keeps her company and it warms me whenever I hear her giving him love.
Congrats! Now it is your responsibility (not your kids or wife etc) to clean up the puppy poops, let the dog outside, take it for walks, discipline it when he gets in the trash, take it to the vet when he eats chocolate or a plastic dog toy, and house train, among many other tasks. It’s like being a single parent but with a dog as the kid. Worth it tho.
What a beautiful dog!
You sure look like a dog now, dog guy. 

Did you get any superpowers or it was just a dog transformation? Can you turn back into human?
Don’t feed him “dog” food. Feed him real food
How do people get such nice looking dogs?
What did you take this picture with? It's wonderful!
"Dad, we want to play with Scrappy now."

"Get your own!"
What a stunner! 💖
thanks dad!
Ngawww
So cute 😍
It’s never to late to let a squishy plump warm lovable fireball love you for life :)
Awww beautiful pup!
Where’s the guy part? You just look like a dog to me.
You were always a dog guy.
Look at that gorgeous piece of fried chicken
Beautiful!
Ppppoo
what the hell are you a professional photographer or what?
I don’t know why I thought of this, but it would be really hard to render this dog in a video game.
My husband was afraid of dogs from being attacked as a child, I’m talking afraid of even a Shitzu puppy. He said everyone who liked dogs was stupid but I knew at heart he was a huge animal lover. I showed him dogs from rescue organizations for months until one day I can me home and he said, “ok, we can get a dog but he has to be an English Pointer, Weim or Vizsla and a puppy and I get to pick him”. 2 days after we got our Pointer I caught him sleeping on the floor in front of the kennel so Higgins wouldn’t be afraid. He loved our English Pointer but all other dogs were “stupid”. Then suddenly all dogs that weren’t hunting dogs were stupid. A few month later all dogs that weren’t big shorthair dogs were stupid. Now we have a little Boston Terrier (his pick) and he wants a Doodle. All it takes is one sloppy unconditional kiss from a dog and all hate and doubt melts.
Make my family get a cat now.
What type of dog is that?
That's a dog?
I just got my free award and you can have it!!! Hopefully this brings good karma because my sister is trying to convince her husband to get a dog for their kids lol!
Wow what a beautiful dog
That’s the cutest dog I’ve ever seen
Dogs that look like this can catch my fade
What about the lr6 AA battery pack ?
Ita a trip
Beautiful photo! Great job!
Ohh she's gorgeous !!
Seriously aww!! His eyes are so remarkable and he looks like a snuggle! Congratulations!
You won't regret it I promise :)
That’s a cute f’ing dog though!!!
He's beautiful though... I can see why.
Never had a dog so you buy a 3k dog. Ok
Wow my dog looks just like that to the point where I genuinely thought it was him at first glance. Is he/she a golden doodle by any chance?
There's no going back. Congrats.
That’s no dog. That’s a  model
Same happened to my parents. Now it feels like they love him more than me >.< But he's cute so i don't care xD
Beautiful dog
So freakin cute
I think you made a great call. 
What kind of breed is he/she?
Aww eugh! Pfwah! Disgusting!
Are you a photo guy? Cause this screams I’m not a dog person but god damn do I know how to take a good dog photo
She's a glorious beast!
i think i saw this on pinterest or on google images
I love this photo of your now-favorite child.
You look a lot like a dog...
That dog is a super model!
That is such a fantastic picture. I’ve looked at it several times just to form the same opinion.
You're in for a treat my man, congrats!! 🐾
And a great photographer
It's a doodle! They're the best dogs and so good around kids. Glad you made the plunge!
That's beautiful. This should be applied to getting to know new people too 🙈
Dogdad
It doesn’t look real
What beautiful dog
Exercising the dog is not optional

you’re 43 but your username is u/SomeTwelveYearOld? weirdo
Reminds me of [this meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/kdm4tm/protecting_its_life_at_all_cost/)!
My heart! Oooof! That is one cute dog :’(
Tell them to turn you.back!
How long did it take? I only just met him and I’m sold.
They will teach a lot of things that will make you a better person, you'll see, congrats man and have a great life with your dogs
when the dog is more photogenic than you... she is so precious and i’m sure enjoying her new home!!
Beautiful picture, I’m a hobbyist photographer and spend more time setting up a soft box and lighting to take pictures of my pets than I’d like to admit. Great lighting here 😃
Omg that dog looks like a teddy bear!!! So cute!!!!!!
Welcome to the other side, my friend! It's wonderful over here.
Once you go dog, you never go back!
I have a funny feeling he's not just some 12 year old
Jesus that dog is insanely cute it hurts...
I like to use logic, and therefore could predict you'd be straight and have a family since you have a dog. I imagine you have a doghouse as well, right?
If I weren't already a dog guy, that face would definitely make me become one
I know this will get lost, but I'm hoping to be laid off for January so I can get a dog and acclimate it to my schedule. Fingers crossed, it's looking like I might have 6 weeks off.
You've gone to The Dog Side....
Aren't you glad you caved
I never understood how not being a dog person was a thing
So fluffy
Meet your new BEST friend .. Congrats
People who aren't dog people become dog people as soon as they see a dog. It's just science.
Me too. I’m pushing 50 and we just got our first dog a year ago. This little guy is my buddy. I love having a dog. I used to be a dog hater.
that is one of the most beautiful photos i have ever seen
Make sure to keep that things butthole trimmed.
Congratulations, life just isn't worth living without a dog, or several.
welcome to the club, mate
Cute dog

Bro, without dog you didnt had life !
I’m 38 and just got our first dog. Right there with you.

My good friend, you are not a Dog Guy.

You are a Dog Man. 

Welcome to the ‘men-who-never-had-a-dog-but-now-have-a-dog club’
nice dog g
Our first dog was a boxer. He enjoyed long walks and the park, but didn't really like to go into the woods at all.

I have a ridgeback now, and this dude *loves* nature hikes. He's got such a keen since of smell that he follows voles underground and tries to dig them out.

It's funny how a dog can change your life. I was never a hiker, but since I got my new dude, I'm out on long walks through wooded trails almost every day.
we're all dog guys.

&#x200B;

Some of us just don't know it yet.
Once they love you, they never stop. Hope your pup has have a long and happy by your side.
We're all dog people.  Some just find out later than others
This was an epic doggon addition. Congrats Pawps!!
43? *username checks out*
Our dog looks just like yours :) we’ve got a west highland terrier crossed with a a poodle (westiepoo). Whatya got there?
Dogs are the BEST. Even when they hotbox your room with stinky dog farts, like mine did last night
Lots of walks for all dogs, especially high energy ones like that beauty
Aawww cute
Never too old to become a dog guy
I'm happy for your kids and for you. Kids are so amazingly wise in many ways. They teach us a lot, and animals do too. Congrats! You won't regret it!!
That dog doesn't even look real. He looks like a stuffed animal!!  
And my daughter says: "Adorable! I have cats, I WANT A DOG! Every time I see 1one I say to my Mommy, 'I want a dog!' then she says, 'We have cats, so nope.' Haha! I love cats and dogs. 🐶🐱! I see a German Shepherd I say, 'I want it!' Same with any dog! But, Mommy says, 'No, we have cats.' Haha!"
Respect man its never too late

Congratulations!
Labradoodle?
Awe my god. 🥺This pup looks like a sweet lil teddy bear. Really good photography skills! Glad you got a new friend.
ALL OF THE UPVOTES
When I was 8-9 I wrote multiple persuasive "research papers" on dogs to convince my parents I was prepared to care for one. They finally gave in and he was my best friend for 13 years, he passed away a few years ago after I graduated college. So on behalf of your children, I thank you.
Dogs were invented to make people happy. Enjoy your new friend’s company.
Are you also a professional photographer because that picture is incredibly professional
Sorry Sir, you will find that is a woo, or a chicken tendy, no dog to be found.
Is it a bitch or a male?
Jeez the pic is so clear. Is it a mobile phone pic or from a real camera?
And a photographer. Beautiful pic.
Dog guys are the goodest guys. Salute to your kids.
Beautiful photo, well done!!
That's a great photo!
Wow, that dog is cute as hell.
It's what dogs do...they suck you in until you can't turn back.

They're evil bastards.
I smell money thats a rich house 😂
Please for the love of dogs make sure to get her on a 6 week grooming schedule starting at 3 months old. It'll save you and the dog so much pain her whole life
Congrats! Dogs are truly the best.
Fantastic photo! Great looking pup too!
Well, your username doesn't check out... lol
Adorable!
How adorable!
Dogs are the best.
This was me at ~39.

A decade later and she's still with us and I love the ol' girl. She's made our life better in so many ways.
Booo hissss hissss
I grew up afraid of dogs, and got my first dog two years ago when I was 28...so happy you’re experiencing this!  
just a note:  you’re going to want another dog very soon soon. I have two now 😆

You were always a dog guy you just didnt want to admit it
Men’s best friend!

Good for you, mayne. I'm 34 and just got my first cat. I feel silly for not liking them before.
Maybe ugly
Beautiful pic 😍
43 years is to long.
Gorgeous😍😍
Now you’re a dog, guy.
Welcome to the fluffy side
Tale as old as time, dad likes photography - dad doesn't want dog - kids force dad to get a dog - dad ends up with 80Gb of dog photos because he has a new photogenic best friend
What breed of dog is this?
Muppets are a lot more realistic these days.
This is a very photogenic pup♥️perfect pic!
I believe you are mistaken, that looks like a teddy bear, not a dog... congratulations on the new family member:)
You’re a wonderful father❤️
That is one photogenic creature.
My brother is about to become dog dad to one of these on Christmas Eve! Same coloring too!! Enjoy your love!
Best of luck! Remember, consistency is key when training. That pup is a cutie!
That's quite a dapper dog!
I would also be a Dog Guy if that was my dog lol.
i'm glad for you having one now but i feel sorry for you not having one when you were a child/teenager
Thank your children!
Beautiful pic
Congratulations!  

Is it a golden doodle?
Welcome to the club, I have grown so much since adopting a dog. Best decision.

It happened to me at 45.  Two years later I can't imagine life without her.
Aren’t you some twelve year old?
That's a majestic looking puppy
Sir, this is not a dog, it’s a teddy bear.
I'm so glad I discovered this community :\~D  Also, I wanna know this Doggo's name!
A story as old as time
Everyone is a dog person, once they realize it
Pretty dog.

Aww, it’s so beautiful! ❤️
And a photographer, definitely.

Unless you stole this photo!
That's the most beautiful dog
Same happened with my father, he didn't want a dog but my mother still got one. Unfortunately after roughly 3 years the dog became very  ill and died (vet tried his best, but couldn't save him). This was the only time I have seen my father crying. While everyone debated about getting a new one my father just called a dog breeder and next week he came home with a puppy, for him it wasn't even a question whether or not we should get a new one.
Never to old to convert to the joys of pupdom... welcome fella, it’s a blast😃😃😃
A dog guy with an octobox and a good ha flex of photography.
#ONE OF US! ONE OF US! ONE OF US!
You LOVE it.
You won’t regret it!
What a beautiful dog.
Great pic! He looks like a soft toy.
What is his or her name?
You look like a dog guy.
Another breeder made a sale.....
Beautiful picture

Wow that’s one heck of a cute photo!!
Golden doodle !! What a beautiful pup!!
Know that feeling. Adopted a cat last year, now I'm a cat guy.
That is the most photogenic dog I've ever seen <3

Awsome
Did you have any pets growing up? It always blows my mind when I hear people say they've never had a pet
What a lovely little pupper. My unsolicited vet advice- get pet insurance!
No wonder! Adorable!
Nice doodle
That’s one good looking pup!
u/SomeTwelveYearOld

Somethings wrong I can feel it
Dude. Did you take that photo? That's so awesome! I'm glad you got the doggo but like- the *quality* of that picture!
This is how all dog people are made
Never had a dog?
Golden Doodle? Is it true, that it barely loses hair?
Enjoy all those wet bills and multiple mandatory walks per day
