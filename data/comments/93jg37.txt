I can tell that they are each other’s heroes, and that is fucking awesome.

So sweet! I’m only cringing because if that’s a brand new tattoo (it looks super red) all of the touching has to sting a bit 😬
This just makes me so happy.  I just lost my big sister last night to cancer and the love between you two just leaps off the screen.  You two are blessed.
Fuck that is straight up beautiful. As a big bro myself I understand the love you have for the youngins.
Why is this categorized under animals?  
Dude that tattoo is fuckin sick
I love that he lets his little brother give him a kiss. This guy has heart.
Not only is this just a beautiful human moment between two people who without question love one another more than anything, but his tattoo (currently the top rated comment in here) is absolutely incredible.
My son has a different special need and this just made me smile. When he’s older I hope he is just as sweet as your brother seems.

Thanks for sharing!
fucking awesome, little bro looks like a fucking warrior
Ok admittedly on my second whiskey and a little emotional but actual tears from this 😭 that is love
I'm positively surprised by the comments here! 
This is amazing coming from someone that also has a brother with special needs. I am sure he felt amazing. 
That is fucking beautiful. You guys are lucky to have each other.
That is such a beautiful moment. Thank you for sharing.
Love how much the lil bro is just engrossed by the tat. Freak'n great. 
Now this is how you show love to your brother, not by dancing out of your vehicle while it flies down the highway.
This.  This is exactly the warmth, compassion, and love that humanity is supposed to exist in.   We can do so much better.  This guy is awesome, and his love for his brother is what families are made of.

This is the most touching thing I've seen. You can tell how much the brothers mean to one another <3
That is the sweetest thing I have ever seen! #brotherlove
This is the first time a tattoo has made me cry. I'm pregnant with my second child currently and hope my two kids love each other like this. 
As a guy with a shit load of tattoos that mostly mean nothing, this is fucking amazing. 
awww man I wish I had a brother!
this is so wholesome ,\_,
That is such a touching thing to do for a sibling
That is an expression of love appreciated right there. 
Man, this just warms the heart. The bond between brothers is such a powerful thing, makes me want to call mine after seeing this.
Jesus, that love was so strong it came through my phone and made me cry
yes you are beautiful.  
Wow! Feeling the love right through this glowing screen... you are the brother that this world needs, sir!
If that's not pure love, then I'm not sure what is.  Absolutely wonderful.
The fact that the tattoo of your brother makes me think he is a beast in all the things he does is awesome! 
I wish my brother loved me this much.
This is fucking beautiful.
Damn, that's such a badass tattoo. Such a great brother.
Aweeeee he’s so happy, adorable!
I wish my bro and I were that close.  :(  
Awesome tattoo. Awesome moment between two bros
Wow that is beautiful, /u/WutUtalkingBoutWill that made my night.

Aw that was really sweet :)
This is awesome and don't anyone give these bros any shit for kissing, you wish you were capable of love like these dudes. 
This is a beautiful moment, thanks for sharing. 


That was beautiful ❤️
That’s magical.
I’m not normally a fan of tattoos, because I feel like your interests always change, and you might grow to regret them later, but there are some things, like love for your family, that won’t fade and I think are totally worth proudly displaying
This made my day. Very sweet
Awesome brotherly bond 
I love that artwork! 
Ooof right in the feelz. God damn i teared up
Brothers are the best—very cool
Alright... this had me tearing up a bit. What a great bond.
This made me tear up. How sweet! It’s obvious you two really care and love each other! Thanks for sharing such a beautiful moment. 
This is really r/aww
What a beautiful moment! 
This is pure love. God bless him
What an awesome moment, and brother. 
This is love.  
Well, that's the best thing I'm going to see today. Or tomorrow.
That kiss.. I'm not crying, you're crying. :)
r/humansbeingbros
That smile lit up on his face as soon as he saw it!
Erobb and Tyler are the sweetest brothers.
I wish my first tattoo was something so great and wholesome with true meaning behind it. Luckily mine is non visible and I just got it because it looked cool. 

Tattoos like this make me want to get something that has a wonderful meaning and I can’t think of anything with such great meaning ):
This gets me in all the feels. 
What a lovely dang moment. I'm glad I was able to share in their happiness. 
This hits a million feelings. 
What a man what a man what a man what a mighty good man.
He’s so caring, makes my heart want to explode. 
Pure love folks
So wholesome- thank you for this. My heart has been warmed 
They kissed on the lips 
Wholesome 
In my feelings. Dope post!
Absolutely awesome.  The love you have for your brother should be the envy of every sibling out there.  That tat is wicked awesome bro.
So badass and so heartwarming at the same damn time <3
You sir do not suck and I appreciate you representing what it's like to be a masculine and compassionate!   \*tips hat\*
This is a totally cool moment. I’m glad you shared this.
very touching :)
Bit dusty in here?
That’s incredible. Direct shot to my feels. God bless them both.
Love, love, love. I am crying like a baby.
Awesome tattoo, your brother looks like a total badass in it. The interaction between you both is equally awesome, thanks for posting that moment.
Bro that shit is dope. 
That filled me with smiles.
I teared up when they kissed, such a sweet moment between brothers. The tattoo is beautiful too. Wholesome af.
A very sweet moment. And what an awesome tattoo! 
About to leave work and now I'm fucking wrecked on the way out you asshole
Dammit! Someone broke into my apartment and cut up a shitload of onions 
That is so sweet! I love seeing good news and happy things like this! Way to be the best big brother!
What a badass tattoo and a beautiful relationship. : )
Aw that kiss was so sweet 
Wow, shows what kind of heart you have.

What a wholesome and loving moment. 
My allergies must be shot. I've had these tears in my eyes and it's the only explanation.
I was never one for tattoos but I like this one! Thanks for sharing!
So sweet 😭
That is beautiful man! Thank you.
You're an awesome brother. Love the moment. 
Geez allergy season really doing work out of no where 
Here come the tears!
Hope they said No homo after this. 
Roll Tide!
I'm always so weirded out when family members kiss each other on the lips. It's also the best way to spread the herpes virus.
Cutest kiss all-time 
These comments will be interesting..
Why do they kissed ?
The kiss on the lips was too much for me... I watched with no audio so it looked rather romantic... 
[deleted]
This a beautiful moment and all but did he just kiss him? Who kisses their brother to say thank you 
Why is he kissing his brother in the lips? I really appreciate this moment but I don't kiss my brother on the lips. 
The kiss
Edit: downvote me. I don't care.
They are brothers? Wtf why are they touching and kissing?
