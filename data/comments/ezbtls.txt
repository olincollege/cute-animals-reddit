That stare is insane.  Looking through her soul...
I want someone to look at me like that good dog looks at the vet
Meanwhile, my pomeranian cries like you are killing her if you even hold her paw....
I don't know much about vet medicine or vet phlebotomy, but is it standard for them not to wear gloves (PPE) during blood draws?
My late dog Jackson used to look at me the same way, all the time. I'm in tears thinking about him. I miss him so much, but I hope this doggy gets plenty of treats for being such a good boy/girl at the vet.
Bestest pupper. 14/10 gets all the treats
From what I know about dog body language, that is a very nervous, anxious dog. Could any experts chime in?
Vet student here, hopefully not too late to the comments. Sorry to be the wet blanket, but this dog is absolutely not happy and is not enjoying this. It‚Äôs demonstrating a type of learned helplessness called freezing (obvious name, I know). Notice how wherever the vet moves the dog‚Äôs leg, it just stays exactly where it‚Äôs placed. The dog doesn‚Äôt attempt to put its leg down or move it at all.  By the way the back legs are situated, this isn‚Äôt a comfortable position but the dog is too afraid to move. Ears are back, the commissures of the mouth are tense and a little back (not a smile like humans smile), there looks to be some whale eye going on, and she‚Äôs sort of hunched up a little like she‚Äôs tense. There is nothing about this that demonstrates that the dog is anything but scared.

Edit: I‚Äôve received tons of comments and have tried my best to respond to them. I want to add that I know that this vet is the dog‚Äôs owner. That doesn‚Äôt change anything. The only thing it may change is how willing the dog is to attack. And even then, maybe not. Owners do things to their pets all the time that make them uncomfortable or scared. Just because you own a pet doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre incapable of doing wrong by it. What is happening in this video is dangerous. No one is restraining the dog and if that needle stick had been anything but perfect it could have caused enough pain to lead that dog to attacking. There would be nothing to stop it. Pet owners know very little about animal behavior, and studies show that vets on average are not much better (see Description of the behaviour of domestic dog, Tami & Gallagher, 2009). So just because this owner is a vet does not mean that she actually knows that her dog is very stressed and scared.

Edit 2: I know this is a long time after the fact, but I wanted to update my comment for anyone who may be looking at this in the future. I emailed the video and some questions to the behaviorist at my school who is board certified in both the US and Europe and has been a veterinarian for nearly 20 years. Here is his response:

‚ÄúWithout knowing details about this dog history, I would say that this dog is stressed and is actually freezing (especially after seeing how he keeps his leg raised even when not contained). The dog also follows the owner's gaze when she moves; this would make me very uncomfortable and I would be very afraid of the dog suddenly jumping and biting. The other dog on the table shows multiple stress signs, like lip licking.

The only possible explanation that comes to my mind and could justify the dog's behavior is previous training by operant conditioning (positive reinforcement), which would have trained the dog to stay completely still. But I strongly doubt this is the case, also considering how worried the other dog seems.

I would not pick this video as an example of low-stress handling. I think that this dog is just petrified because of his fear.‚Äù
[deleted]
I'd be afraid that dog was about to bite me. I thought dogs staring into someone's eyes was a sign of hostility?
Am I the only one concerned that the vet keeps her face extremely close to the dog mouth, such that the dog could easily stretch out and nip at her face?

Edit: Never let your child put their face near any dog's face.  Often instructing your child to stay clear of the animal is something that the dog owner will take as an insult (you know.... the common "my dog would never bite" complexion). When faced with insulted owners, simply tell them that its not that you don't trust their dog; its that you don't trust your child who might hit the animal or pull its tail without notice. That's usually enough damage control to let the owner move on to a new thought process.  Good dogs can have bad moments, just like bad dogs can have good moments.
the guy tensed up?
That's a true professional right there...she did not break down and kiss the snoot or boop the snoot even once!
Oh my lord what a good boi! Or girl!

This dog looks so much like my Kayleigh. Poor baby is scared
That vet is amazing.

Deserves a bowl of treats
Sweet baby
Handling it better than most kids.
Helpless dog fucking paralyzed with fear
The woman is the dog's owner and did this before with no problems. This went viral here in Brazil a while ago.
She's not scared or high, it's just not her first rodeo (as the vet states)
Pretty insane that the mods here removed the useful, respectfully stated comment by vet student /u/ratajewie...

I'd **love** to hear someone try to come up with a reasonable justification for that.
What a SWEET baby.
That support boi needs some love
Aww I can‚Äôt handle the cuteness
This is so sweet it makes my heart hurt
This dog melts my heart.
I can not get enough of watching this!
He doesn't even put his paw back down, what a sweet boy. But he looks terrified. Dogs are amazing.
MYY HEEEAAAART
I can‚Äôt even get my dog to sit still for me to pluck her ears OR EVEN TO LET ME PLUCK HER EARS. What a good boy....
My late cat was the favorite of all vets, cats are famous for being hissy but he was so sweet, sat down and buckled up for any needle coming his way. Miss his calmness.
Good girl!
There's something really odd about this video. The dog is completely calm and submissive and yet my brain is adding some kind of weird tension to the clip.
I'm a 43 year old man. It took me three attempts at watching this video to get past the needle bit.

I'm not scared of needles, I just didn't want to see the dog flinch but he ended up being braver than me.
That look that's so scared but also trusting.  When I brought my sick cat to the vet and they had to take her temperature, the look of betrayal broke my heart.
Aw, she's using a butterfly needle. It's smaller and doesn't hurt as bad as the larger needles. This vet is a keeper.
That dog is calmer around needles than I am üòÇ
What is she say?? Can anybody translate?
What a sweet face :)
i think he's just in love with his vet
So sweet
The trust in those eyes swell my heart.
I wish all dogs were this good getting blood drawn cause there‚Äôs nothing worse than having to wrestle down a 100 pound German shepherd that doesn‚Äôt want shit to do with you to begin with
OMG. That face says it all. I trust you. Please don't hurt me.üê∂
What a good baby

What a brave boy
She must know this dog very well. Attempting that without a holder would normally be dangerous or waste a lot of time.
That dog is crazy focused... and in love
u/zia1997
Okay this is adorable you can't say no
So my miniature poodle is an asshole and it‚Äôs soured me to the point that I was truly fearful that the vet was leaving herself open to being bit in the face, was hard for me to watch without feeling anxious.
I want a sub just full of these
Our old family dog used to always lick vets while they were doing things on him, I guess he never minded, but he was the calmest, sweetest dog ever. Apparently he licked the vet when she was giving him his final rest too, must have been heartbreaking for my father who witnessed it. Rip little friend.
He is adorable and seems to trust her, painkillers or not.
When my dog gets a prickle in his paw, he just stops and raises the affected paw for me to take the prickle out. Its adorable
I was waiting for the kisses she/he wanted to give..
Cute doggo
He‚Äôs setting a good example to show the other dog it ain‚Äôt that bad
Brave doggo! <3
Bro I almost cried at that. The good boi just looks so trusting. This the kinda shit I mean when I say P R O T E C
As a veterinary assistant, this video makes me very very nervous hahaha. But kudos to the doc and the dog!
As someone who works at a vet hospital, this makes me uneasy. This dog is clearly nervous. We don‚Äôt do any blood draws or injections without someone doing some sort of restraint. Even dogs we know very well can be unpredictable in environments they aren‚Äôt used to, or if they aren‚Äôt feeling well. 

Don‚Äôt even get me started on the other dog on the table...
"You look like a good doctor" - dog thinking
Let me upvote this more
Awwwwww. My heart has been melted.
That dog did better than me when I got my blood work done. 

For anyone who is curious, yes I am extremely iron deficient and do my makeup on the floor because I can‚Äôt stand up.
What a good dog
When you fall in love with your doctor !
This pup is a perfect example of "angel on earth"
I knew she was Brazilian even before I turned the sound on. Brazilian vets are great and caring, all my pets would be exactly like that, never aggressive or scared.
Now I live in Sweden and it's the opposite, the vets here are 100% money driven and they don't even know how to handle the animals, my cats and dog are often scared and reactive. It's really sad and every time we need to bring them it's a small fortune for 15 minutes of shitty service.
Que fofo esse dog *-*
My German Shepherd hates the way his ears feel after I clean them, but he'll ask for me to clean them when they get itchy. He knows that it'll help eventually.
Puppy Love
The vettech was so gentle and reassuring and your dog has got to be one of the most loving and trusting dogs I have seen. YOU have done that! He trusts you implicitly that you would never allow him to be hurt. You are a wonderful dog parent!
If only someone would look at me the way that doggo looks at her
brazilian gud boi
That dog is drugged out of his mind and is currently having a conversation God
Vet tech here. Was seeing some comments about the pain from being stuck with a needle, people who have dogs that won't let you touch their paws, and the dog looking like it's about to snap in the video. Wanted to chime in. 

Dogs don't feel needle pricks the same way we do. Their skin has a lot of space between the layers, unlike us. I was taught that this has something to do with their perception of being stuck with needles - it's a different experience.

This dog was most likely not born just "well-behaved." When a dog lashes out for having their paw touched, it's because they learned that that's the action they should take in order to stop their paws being touched. My vet is big on dog behavior, and he does workshops with owners and their dogs during their routine appointments, to work on this very issue. If you train your dog from an early age that you're not gonna let go of their paw no matter how much they dislike it, they will become much calmer and will probably trust you more all around. It's important to know this information, because it can save your dog undue stress throughout their life (removes need for sedation for routine vet visits, and makes nail-trimming MUCH easier - and SAFER - for all parties involved, i.e. yourself, groomer, vet techs, vet).

Finally, people think the dog looks like it might lash out in this video. It's hard to tell, because we can't see the dog's whole body. The fact that there is no one restraining the dog makes me think that this vet is familiar with this dog.  I noticed that the dog does not lick his lips, which makes me think he is not going on the aggressive. The intense stare is probably a plea for eye contact, to make sure he knows that he's being a good boy. When she lets go of his leg, he keeps it held up - he's really anxious, sure, but I don't get any sort of sense of danger from this video.
That look melts my heart...so pure in their love for humans... Just makes me more anticipated in getting my first pet once i start a job....
If I do same, they'll call me a creep
Such a brave puppo!!
aight imma just stare at the ceiling
Wow that dog needs treats. And cuddles. Such a good dog.
Anyone know what kind of dog this is?  My dog looks very very similar, but she's all of that red color, no dark areas.  The pound where I got her said Jack Russell, but it's not a coloring for them, as far as I can tell, and she looks more like this dog than a JR.
It's really interesting to notice the dog in the back paying close attention to when the vet gets the needle in, sniffing really close, then licking his lips and looking away (signs of distress/'I don't like this'). Such good pups!
That dog is so pure. I'm crying somebody send help.üò´üíû
The amount of trust and love coming from those eyes...
Such a good baby üíï
Shout out to the vets that helped make my dog's last few months as comfortable as possible.  


When we'd drop him off for chemo and for checkups, we could hear him bork and the vet techs all laugh and cheering as he went through his full complement of tricks. They were all so sweet and so attentive to my boy. In the nearly twelve years I had with him, he was never once afraid to go to the vet. After we had to let him go, I saw a few of them again ( the cat had issues right after the dog passed, 2019 was a bitch) and each nurse that found out looked so utterly crestfallen, it broke my heart all over again.  


Anyway I'm rambling, a great vet is worth their weight in gold and I'm glad this pup feels safe enough to be so calm.
He‚Äôs more brave than everyone on this site would be in that situation
This is the goodest boy I have ever seen.
Does anyone think that dog must be sedated? I‚Äôve had many dogs in my life and never seen one act like that
What a loving pup. Just leaves the paw up ready for the vet ... pup is so brave and loving üíôüíôüíô

I freaking DIE. Wish my pup knew this/looked at me like this whenever I try to take little stickies out of her feet.
‚ÄúLOOK INTO MY EYES‚Äî I am TRUSTING you!!! Do not betray this trust!!!‚Äù
Woa, didn't even flinch when the needle went in. He's doing a better job than I do when I get my blood drawn.
Omfg that‚Äôs adorable
Sweet Lord is pup's  face heavenly.
such a calm boy
Aww, the ultimate trust video ever!
My heart. I want it back
So brave!!! So sweet :)
Incredibly good boy.
He kept her paw up when the vet let go, like a good patient.
Brazilian caramel dog. The most loyal street breed ever!
His eyes....my heart....So awesome.
That dog is braver than me.
Wow this is so amazing. New fav video. My pibble is good at the vet but this is next level good girl

This dog does better getting blood drawn than I do!
Aw! Some dogs really do know that the vet helps them feel better. My dog has had chronic pancreatitis and bladder stones all his life (he's on a special diet, but it still happened sometimes when he was younger). He has never enjoyed car rides no matter what, so we kept car rides down to a minimum. The only place he associates the car with is the vet. Whenever he started feeling really sick and we knew it was time for an emergency vet visit, he'd walk to the car on his own and try to jump in, like "Hey, I need to go to that place that fixes me RIGHT NOW, c'mon guys let's go."
What an absolute angel.
I think its just high
This dog's calm behavior at the vet is the exact opposite of my dog's, whose body trembles and tries to find his way back to me to climb up my shoulder lol. Amazing.
These dogs from Brazil, let me tell you something they are smart than average
What a good doggo!!!
that is very sweet.
Genuine question. It seems that animals can sense malicious intent. I wonder why is that the case.

That's what I call a good vet.
That is one drugged up pup.
What a good dog! I have to look straight ahead when I'm getting poked too!
God I wish people were like that when they needed a blood test
My heart is melting .....
When the vets come to vaccinate my dog I have to call my neighbours to help me hold him down
This makes me sad... reminds me of our little guy we had to put down last March.

I held him in my arms all the way to the vet while my MIL drove.  I'm not ashamed to admit I bawled like a little kid that day, and the day I brought his ashes home.

I still miss him.
Such a good and brave boy!
Dogs are sacred and beautiful creatures and anyone who harms one I swear to all that is unholy that I will make the realm of Khorne look like a preschool.

Ok what's that dog been smoking that it's so chill, and can I have some?
"Who's a good patient?  Who is it?"

u/vredditshare
Gonna guess this a blood donation dog. Probsbly has done this plenty of times. With the tech praising and rewarding him along the way. It‚Äôs the same stuff I tell people about trimming your dog‚Äôs nails. If the dog thinks holding still briefly or getting their nails trimmed is apart of life they won‚Äôt act like a beauty that Steve is trying to grab.
I always felt like a monster when I had to do a blood draw on a dog that was being super sweet. They'd be all snuggly, and watch me with confusion when I was doing the draw but then they'd usually give me another cuddle or two.
What kind of dog is this?
omg kiss him
Why she is not wearing gloves?
my cats were always super chill at vets, they have some friendly energy radiating from them
I wish my girl cat knew we were trying to help her. She's suffering from suspected heart failure and won't eat. Having to force feed her with a syringe and she's choking and all sorts :'(
This is straight off tik tok.
Ges prolly barred out
Reminds me of the pitty that offered his paw to the vet. So cute.
To cope with going through life, the pains it brings, and the amount of needles I had to take from doing stupid shit and ending up in the hospital... I've became partially masochistic.
Wow, is that Pam!?  I actually think this would have been her true calling.
I think its pure trust
How is he saying so much while doing nothing??

I appreciate you
He/she looks exactly like one of my dogs
Cuttttie dog !!!
I swear dogs and cats have a special innocent look to them. I can only compare it to a baby smiling or something haha
I'm surprised that she isn't wearing gloves
I wanna hug this dog so damn much. omg.  the sweetness is off the charts
What an absolute angel, I've never seen a braver pup at the vet. <3


They never broke eye contact - trusts the doctor, but must still watch the doctor, always. What a good dog!
That's absolutely not what the whole body of that dog is saying.
What a sweet face.
Rule number 2 if doggie dating. Never break eye contact... Never.
Accidentally brought the dog statue from the garden.

Such a good doggy. I watch alit of animal shows and it rips at your heart when they show animals that are hurt, sick, been severely neglected and yet their tails are still wagging to show how they still love unconditionally.
He probably is quick to faint so looks away. Good boy
awww so trusting
My first dog used to do this! She would stick out her arm for the vet too, without being prompted. I miss her :(
Oh that little wavy arm in the air :'(
I would never put my face that close to a dog let alone when I am pushing a needle into them.
Wow, I'd be staring at her like that too.

Dog is memorizing her face for revenge
There's a stray dog that lives on our street back home. (We tried to adopt her. She doesn't like confinement. She likes the freedom). But she comes to our gate at lunch and dinner time. 

She got hurt once and came upto my mom to show her. Mom regularly applied ointment until it healed, and she wouldn't stop thanking my mom by coming up to press her nose against mom's leg.

Dogs are marvelous animals
"You are beautifull"
 It's a *Caramelus brasiliensis* the best dogs in the multiverse.
He leans with her. What a connection.
No way, that's the same face I give the phlebotomist
Maybe if I keep looking at her lovingly she wont stick that needle in me
I'm glad someone is caring in helping that dog, it really warms my heart.
Awwww
Didn't even flinch. Brave dodge.
I'm not crying; you're crying!
Take note ladies. THIS is eye contact.
My dog looks just like this but has the exact opposite reaction at the vet lol
Cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all week.
I would give a ward to this strong dog BUT I'm poor hahaha

Pretty sure that dog is high as a kite!
My heart, SOMEBODY PLEASE! Get me back my heart, this dog just melted it!
Or he just has the hots for her
It‚Äôs always so sweet when a dog knows you are helping them even if they are uncomfortable or it‚Äôs somewhat painful. They look at you like ‚Äúthis hurts but I know you‚Äôre doing something that needs to be done.‚Äù So much trust.
‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen a braver patient.‚Äù
Precious baby! <3
He's crushing hard.
This legitimately made me tear up
Oh sweet angel
What angelic creature is that bestowed upon the vet!?
Such a great pupper!
Dogs are so brave
I love how she trys to comfort him with words even though he cant understand her
I felt this comment needed to be here as it makes it exactly 700 comments unless you are late to the party
I knew r/ithadtobebrazil even before I turned the audio on
Absolute trust!
Is this dog high lol
looking stoned af
As someone who worked as a phlebotomist, this dog behaves better than most patients.
He is the bravest, and the bestest boy
Could be a dog that regularly donates blood for other dogs. I bet it gets to be old hat for them after a few times.

have a cat like that. gets scared due to being at the vet, climbs on vets shoulder.

How does the vet make sure the needle goes into the vein with all that fur around? When I get an IV or a blood test they have to "hunt" for the vein.
If that were me, there‚Äôd be a Monica shaped hole in the wall. That dog is a better person than I am.
We dont deserve dogs, what a good boy
‚Äú I don‚Äôt like needles can I look away ‚Äú üòÇ
It's so cute
My heart...help.
That dog is high af. He's not even looking at her as she moves around. He's just staring at that one spot constantly
Aww good doggy
Wow! I wish my pups were like that at the vet!
This really hit me hard.  We had to put our 14-year-old rescue down this past Friday and that process was similar.  Except the vet and her tech were literally laying on a floor because that's where he was most comfortable and they spent an hour comforting him and slowly doing the process.

This doggo is amazing!
The doggy truly knows it too.
My cat is diabethic and we have to give him 2 injections a day
Relationship goals, get you someone or something that looks at you the way this bestest doggo looked at the vet. While not flinching at the sight or feeling of a needle stabbing you.
Shouldn't she be wearing gloves?
Doggy putting on his brave face.
What kind of dog is that?
I want to take him home too.
He's enchanted.
Such a sweet lil dogen.
Those eyes
I think he is high on pain drugs.
It looks like the dog is a "donor dog", donating blood to the dog next to it or another one... the dog seems to know the process, scared about the needle, bit knowing it'll get pets/treats/etcetera after helping. Possibly the case here?!!
Druggo
Also the face, right before they bite you.
Better than some of my human patients.
hah

Omgeeee my heart üò´
That dog deserves a treat
I understand you (the doctor) are helping me (the doggo pictured in the video).
Awww the goodest boi üò™
I think the dog is trying to communicate. Maybe telepathic conversation.
Looks pretty intense, so I'm convinced the dog is explaining what happened during the accident.
"a funny thing thing happened on the way to the kennel"
Also dog


"Thanks for giving me the good stuff Doc"
Need me a wife like this
Dang didn't even flinch!
he want kiss
Is it normal for vets not to wear gloves?
She‚Äôs a Brazilian vet... So wholesome his face!!! Needs endless smooches!
üòçüòçüòç
"Don't look at the needle, don't look at the needle .."
Could this dog be a blood donor for the one lying just behind it? It might explain the dog's resolve, if it had been through this many times and knew it was going to be loved and praised after.
What a cutie.  My dog would have shit himself and started biting everything.
CHOMP right in the face
Such a good girl.
This definitely helped me
It's all in the eyes. The dog can tell this person comes from a good place, a safe place.
Adorable
Just the sweetest face
Aww I want to hug that dog
What a gud boi
I do not understand how she could resist kissing that face

She is a lovely, gentle lady, but even so, this is the best doggy. ;_;
This is my dog at the vet. Not sure why she knows, but she always knows. They have told me 2 times that they have never seen a dog so ready to get their anal glands expressed. Weird but true ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
People arent even this well behaved.

Look at those loving eyes ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
That look is intense lol üíñ
i wish my dogs like that
she‚Äôs a good girl don‚Äôt get me wrong
but she‚Äôs also an asshole
Brave hero!
I always used to hear from vets how brave my kitty was. She would NOT let anyone mess with her, but when he needed medical attention, she apparently knew it.  I had to feed her through a feeding tube every 6 hours for a week, and she was like "Ok, I guess it's time for that again."
It looks stoned
Find someone who looks at you like this dog looks at her.
Shouldn‚Äôt she be wearing gloves?
WHAT A FUCKING GOOD BOY
My cat just straight up dont give a sheet when it comes to dis.
Arent veterinarians scare of dogs biting their faces off as a reaction of the sudden pain of the needle?
Its absolutley adorable!
Puppy dog eyes! Awww
Dog inner monologue. 
Don't look down, don't look down, maintain eye contact. Breath in thru my nose. Fuck fuck fuck.
That pupper is on some shit
Why isn't she wearing gloves? I would think since she used an alchohol wipe to disinfect the area, shouldn't she be using gloves?

I am fortunate in that my dog is very good at the vet. She even shakes her ‚Äúdoggie doctor‚Äôs‚Äù hand when the vet enters the room and says hello to her, it‚Äôs so cute it just about kills me haha
yet my dog has a seizure on the tables everytime and has to be given xanax in the back with a muzzle on
Damn.. I wish my adult human patients were like this üòÇ
The dog took that better than most people.
That face is so sweet and trusting ‚ù§‚ù§
I want to give this pup all of the kisses!!! üò©üòçüòç
Pretty sure the dog is high
Dog's braver than i am
Our old dog was just like this. The new dog though, the new dog HATES the vet. It's sad to see. She's a rescue and doesn't trust the vet at all.
Awww
I want to hug that dog.
That face, oh my goodness.  Amazing dog did amazing.
Looks in love just staring into her eues
hers very good and very brave girl
That was a nice video to watch after seeing that racist bitch ranting on the video before.
That doggo is smitten.
Thanks, I just remembered I need to hug my dogs again.
N√£o d√≥i.
Is he a donor dog? I'm guessing this isn't his first time!
.
Such a good boy
Looks like he/she wants to say... ‚Äúyo, I love u so fucking much rn‚Äù
Awww, he is the goodest boy.
Goodest boy
Who's a good patient. Who's a good patient...
I wanna cry now I feel so bad
This reminds me of my German Shepherd. I found him in a creek not too far from my house near Memphis and he was really apprehensive to coming near me. I had 2 black Labradors already so I got their leash and he was still there when I came back. He had no collar so I looped the leash and kneeled and he came to me all while growling. His hackles weren't up so I didnt feel like I was in danger as I put the leash around him. The moment he had it on he was like a different dog. Super loving. I brought him back to the house and kept him in the backyard as I made some calls to help find the owner of this now starving dog. After I came out, he was chilling under the roof. I noticed he had a lot of ticks so I brought out some bleach and alchohol. As I started picking, he played his head on my lap and as the rain came down we both quietly picked the ticks and played them in the bleach. It's my favorite memory I have of Doc and him passing in late last year beat me up a lot. I probably wont find another dog like him, but i know i can love the next one just as much.
Her touch mimics licking. She holds the paw at an angle similar to when a dog is limping.  


She's communicating a lot do that dog.
Blink mfuckrr blink!!
Do vets not wear gloves?
Poor puppy. Hopefully, he/she gets well soon.
Omg what a beautiful patient little baby
With that posturing, he/she could snap at any second. Ears pinned back, rigid. Hellll No.
I am in LOVE with that Doggo!
I hope the doggo is ok...
Im a vet and this must be photoshop
 When your gf have BIG 'eyes' and you are trying to don't look inüòÇ
Such a good boi
Fuck, that level of trust is exceptional. Respect to the canine kind!
This is my dog at the vet too.  He was also the same when we adopted him at the SPCA.  He was sick but when a human is helping him out he chills out and acts like you want any good boy to act.

See you when I get home from work Amos!
Aw, I want to hug him.
No gloves
I don't have a dog, but I have a story with a vet in it. 
  
One afternoon I dropped by a friend's house. He told me he was taking his dog to the vet and I, having nothing better to do, tagged along.  
  
At the clinic (by the way: the dog is ok, was just there for some vaccines), the vet was THE hottest woman I ever saw in my life.   
    
I wanted to say something, but could not think of anything, being in that professional environment and all.  
  
Since, the friend (and his dog) moved to somewhere far away, so that was that.
I could never be a vet. Imagine having to stick a needle into a poor dog who is scared shitless, let alone put down one
He either is better behaved than me, a grown ass man, when it comes to needles, or he is like me and just petrified with fear
What a sweet dog! He's smitten with the vet! Awww!!!!
Me when anyone shows me the most minimal amount of affectation and physical contact
My dog had her needles last week and somehow the new vet got this look. My little dog is very suspicious of strangers but this lady just rubbed her back a couple times and won her over. Amazing people.
Oh my goodness,  that precious and pure little face!!
THE GOODEST BOY oh my god my heart just melted
Such a very good boi
We seriously don't deserve dogs.
He's so cute, he deserves all the treats after that
What a sweetheart! ‚ô•Ô∏è
Looking for a family dog and that dog looks super chill and fits the size range we are looking for. What type of dog is that? Im a dog noob. Any help is helpful.
We don't deserve dogs x
I can‚Äôt handle this
Veterinarians and nurses are some of the best and most kind people I know
Either he really likes her or he is like if she does one shady thing I‚Äôm bitting her right in the face.
Wow, he/she is so focused on the vet that he even follows her head movements. So trusting in her :)
What a good boy!

But seriously, who the fuck keeps cutting these onions?!
Bayootiful brave boo! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Poor Doggo looks stoned!
I wish I had the bravery of this doggo
He or She looks kind of like my dog ‚ô•Ô∏è so cute
Ma'am, i think that dog softlocked, i suggest restarting it
I know you are helping me but I'm very scared and I probably won't look. Thank you and please hurry.
Smart doggo
Congratulations Reddit.....you finally got me to cry.

I have seen some things on here the last 6 years....good and bad. But this dog locking eyes with this vet.....I couldn't take it.

That is THE most precious video I've ever watched.

Great dog!!!!! üêï
Grown ass man crying in a hotel room.   My pal died on Monday.   This guy reminds me of him during vet visits.
So that‚Äôs what puppy dog eyes look like
Wow, so brave. Hope he‚Äôs healthy
Damn lump in my throat after watching that
Dogs have a crazy high pain tolerance. My dog is old, like 15, she has arthritis real bad.  That doesn‚Äôt stop her from wanting to go on walks! I feel bad because she will start limping part way through, but no matter how long the walk, once we get back to the house, she would rather keep walking
I can‚Äôt count how many times I looked awau
The dog got enough balls to not even look at the needle
We don‚Äôt deserve dogs
OMG what an angel.
That was one heckin‚Äô brave boi!
Ah, dogs.  Wonderful animals.
Good pup.
What a brave boy!
He looks like he has a huge crush on her.
The goodest of good boys
I would give award but im too goddam poor :(
