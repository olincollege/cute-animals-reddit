At least you know that in the event of a real spider this homie has got your back!
Like she is actually counting the legs to be sure it's a spider
I woke my cat up to try this and it took three spider drawings before he patted one then curled up back to sleep.

Edit: holy upvotes Batman
His lil swipes and follow through were so cute, then bam, pounce time!
Literally waiting excitedly for you to prepare the game! So cute.
Little known fact: cats can‚Äôt read upside down
S/he watched you draw it, and still attacked it!
So does that make the drawing photorealistic?
Priceless! Thank you
that little hop is so cute
Oh my gosh how adorable!!!!!
This cat has no spider sense.

Back in highschool, 1990-1ish, I had this poster on the wall over my bed, one day my cat was laying on my chest, looked up at the poster, stood up against the wall and started swatting at the splat/bullet holes, drove her crazy. https://images.eil.com/large_image/METALLICA_ONE-49291.jpg
You should at least have a spider once in a while,  to test his skills.  Make him feel good
I can't help it...

I feel Ike this is going to be the next pet trend. I expect to See my feed full of cats attacking spider drawings in 3....2....1....
The biggest revelation here for me is that cats can turn their wrists
Why can‚Äôt I get it? WHY CANT I GET IT!
This is soooooo good
I'm a spider kindness advocate but this guy checking his little paws to see if he caught it is very cute.

Haa! Still laughing :)
I am happy for you to post one of these every day! It will never get old!
I couldn't concentrate on the cat because of the missing apostrophe. I need help.
I just tried this, my cat looked at me like I had 2 heads.
Oof. I can hear the cat's paws n claws scrape the paper and it gives me heavy jeebies!
We've been tricked
This is hilarious üëç
You know that feeling when you say cats are cute is the same when you say cats are dumb. Aww.
Trompe l'oeil
You‚Äôre such a cute kitty Kat!
So how well can cats see, actually?
I saw a similar post and wanted to show my mum. I drew a tiny one on an A3 sheet of paper and placed it on the floor while she was temporarily outside. I went to the the cat, but it of course didn't want to go so it took a  while and as I was going down the stairs I heard the equivalent of "Oh fuck!", Except in my language. Yea, I wanted to show her cats are stupid.
nice
From the cat's perspective, you must look like a Sith Lord, creating life itself.
He looks legit startled when he looks at his paw and the spiders not in it.
You are the best kind of person
nice act

I was expecting a real one to appear.
Aww I love cats so much, this one is just so cute trying to catch it's little fake spider.
This is actually adorable
Once my wife screamed to me that there was a huge spider that came out from a firewood I brought, but when after two seconds she turn back to him to show me where it is, he was gone which made her went crazy :D
This cat is a shame to us all cat people.

Spiders and the reactions to spiders seem deeply embedded into our and animal DNA. Must be an alien god kind of thing.

Had  wood spider, according to her pediatrician, inject so much venom into my allergic daughter's leg that it was puffed up and had blistered as though she'd been scalded.

Doctor said there was nothing he could do, admired her 'expensive' sneakers which were bought for $5 at a consignment shop, then charged us $150 for an approximately 10 minute visit.

We had to keep our house spider free, just in case. We lived next to a large patch of woods so it was catch and release.
Gotta try this with my cat

 No! That's not how you're supposed to play the game!
So technically it isn‚Äôt spider time because no spider?
The cast would be like " Yo your humans are cool and All but my human can summon fricking ghost spiders"
u/vredditdownloader
Darn spider!
I love when cats try to scoop shit with their paws and take a closer look.
That's really touching. I mean the spider, not the video.
This is the second time in a day I've seen a cat get bamboozled by fake spiders.

&#x200B;

I gotta try this with my cat.
u/vredditdownloader
I like how he checks his paw to make sure
There is no missing apostrophe. "It" is referring to the cat. It is "the cats spider time".
What a good kitty! Spiders shouldn't be there, even if they're imaginary ones drawn in pen.
That cat is Garfield.

We had a Black Widow that decided to take up residence on our black trash barrel. (for those of you who don‚Äôt have designated barrels, BLACK is for regular trash as opposed to recycling & yard debris).                                                         She had egg sacks from time to time, and in the evenings would climb down on her web and hunt.                                                Madam-as we fondly named her-was pretty amazing. Every trash day she managed to hang on under the top lip of the barrel when the truck hoisted & dumped the barrel . I kid you not, I worried about her throughout the day and as soon as work was over I came straight home to find her still there.             A couple of weeks I even took all our trash bags out if it wasn‚Äôt too full and put them in our neighbor‚Äôs barrel just to give her a break.                                            This went on for about six months or so until my amazing daughter the Bug Whisperer-with heart pounding-managed to catch her in a jar. She and her boyfriend had previously scoped out an area in the woods and placed her in a log .                                                                They watched her kind of take in her surroundings, then she walked away to make a new home.                                               I still think of Madam from time to time and wish her well (also thank her for never biting us!).                                                THE END

Oh no hooman you accidentally spammed a spooder.

It okay though I'll turn it into fooder
This is adorable. 

But I cant stop staring at the two differently written E's
What makes me sad is that the cat actually believes thats a spider.
I think thats because it was never allowed outside.
I had plenty of cats and none of them reacted to anything short of a real animal. They would just look at me like: ‚ÄúWtf bro, dont think Ill fall for that!‚Äù
