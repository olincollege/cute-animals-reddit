I am so invested!  Absolutely stunning setup.   I look forward to your update!
With a sweet setup like that no wonder they keep coming  back
We had a pair of ducks visit our yard for a few years. We called them Mr. and Mrs. Fefflehoffer. They never had babies, we were just a rest stop for them.
That is just *delightful*. Thank you for improving my rather dark day.
We now expect to recieve weekly reports on the ducks throughout the summer.
What do they eat? I assume there isn't food in the pond
Tony Soprano? Knew he didn‚Äôt die at the end.
That's like a duck spa.
Solid way to spend quarantine

Is your dad Tony Soprano?
r/HumansBeingBros
Go, dad!
Tony, is that you?
Aww.  I love your Dad.  Can I have him?
Remember to post follow up videos
Your Dad is a good egg.
This might be the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen all year.
No wonder she comes back every year. They wouldn‚Äôt be able to make me leave.
They may never leave now
I‚Äôve got a couple of returning ducks too.  The babies run like hell from me, like a fast forwarded recording
> The [hamsa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamsa_(bird\)) (Sanskrit: ‡§π‡§Ç‡§∏, ha·πÉsa or hansa) is an aquatic bird of passage, which various scholars have interpreted as the goose, the swan, or even the flamingo. Its icon is used in Indian and Southeast Asian culture as a spiritual symbol and a decorative element. It is believed by Hindus to be the vahana (or vehicle) of Brahma, Gayatri, Saraswati, and Vishvakarma.
What the duck! That's awesome!
*auto correct actually worked this time*
... Tony?
This is so sweet! What a beautiful place to lay eggs and raise babies. 

My mom had a pair of ducks that would come to her door every year in the spring time. She got actual duck food to feed them and they would quack at the door every morning until she came out to feed them. They came to her house for probably 7-8 years before she had to move. I have pictures of my two sons laying on their stomachs next to the screen door watching them eat their food. :)
Your dad‚Äôs the greatest!
Is your dad Tony Soprano?
This looks so beautiful and peaceful.15/10 would meditate in your dad's garden.
Is your dad named Tony and in sanitation by any chance?
Is your dad Tony Soprano?
Did they eat any fish your dad had in the pond?
Some Tony Soprano type stuff.
Need a follow up video of the ducklings going down the ramp
Why that is one lucky duck! 

My grandparents old garden worked as a fast pass for the ducks in town when they went from the city center park to the nearby creek at the edge of town, where they would raise their young. Twice a year ducks would parade through their garden. I remember my dad telling me about one time, where my grandmother went out, dressed in her morning robe and held back traffic so that the ducks could pass safely all the ducklings. My grandmother was a very no-nonsense lady, just the mental image makes me chuckle.

This is so perfect for them I raised ducks for a little while and they will love this.
Tony Soprano would be proud
*Tony Soprano has entered chat*
I would love to see his list of parts used to create the pond and equipment used. We've been wanting to add one to our yard. This is just so cozy & quaint
I wish he would set up a live duck cam
The garden is amazing!
Nice wing man
I mean if you create an opulent buddhist temple resort in your backyard, that's where I would go for maternity leave too.
Looks like he‚Äôs got...

*sunglasses.meme*

...all his ducks in a row.
I had a hen mallard nest under a big rhubarb plant in my back yard a couple of years ago.  The hen successfully hatched all but one of the eggs and then we had a frantic hen and her babies trying to get out of our backyard.  It was a long way to any stream or lake and we ended up trying run interference for the mom and help shepherd her clutch to the nearest park with water.  She knew the way, but it was a very hot day and the duckings were exhausted halfway there and stopped in a very dangerous (high traffic) spot.  It was just too far to safety and the ducklings were all the worse off because of the heat.  We ended up rounding them all up and taking them in a storage tub lined with lots of grass to a wildlife rescue center three hours away.  They were fostered by an old granny mallard that couldn‚Äôt return to the wild.  They ducklings did well and were released later that year.
That's wholesome!
Beautiful!
He us so kind
My parents have a decent sized pond and ducks would often make their nests on the banks, but snakes would get to them a lot. So my dad made a wood platform, stuck pool float noodles to the bottom and pushed it out into the middle of the pond for the ducks to safely make their nests on (: pretty awesome as a kid
I used to live in an apartment complex with a huge duck pond, and there was a few swans. The swans would nest every year right next to the sidewalk and were very mean! Residents were warned though that anyone messing with Bruce (the male and head swan) would be evicted.... There were a lot of odd things about that place...

I would be willing to donate a webcam for this..... this is amazing.
Tony Soprano enters the chat.
Man, imagine being a duck and finding a dope little spot like this to return to year after year. Like you don't tell your duck friends about it bc you don't want the word to get out.
This pond needs a webcam.
Your dad‚Äôs tenants need an IG acct or live cam so we can follow and indulge our already existing obsession with them
Edit for typos
My duck-visit experience was much different.
I used to live in a three-story house. In a pretty forested area but still in a town. Three summers in a row, a duck would fall down the chimney and end up stuck in the pipe that goes toward our wood furnace.

The first year it happened it really freaked me out because I just heard scratching from the pipe where there is I thing you can turn to let more air in or out. But it was blocking the way for the duck. but I ended up being able to turn that thing and wiggle a bit and it ended up falling into the furnace thankfully it was empty but it still got so dirty.

I took it out of there and brought it to the nearest lake. Hoped for the best.
then two years in a row after that a duck would end up doing the same thing.
Weird! We used to have the same 2 ducks for like 7 years come back every summer and nest in our yard. Ducks don't have life long relationships, but I'm convinced these 2 did. It was a very specific part of our yard in which no other ducks anywhere came to.

It was nice until we got eagles. Then ducks, squirrels, crows and cats all started disappearing.
Please update with a video of the little ducklings using your special path.
The ducks are drawn to the atmosphere of the yard. I know I am. Your dad must be very chill.
I'd be honored to have ducks come lay eggs in my garden
I haven't read any comments and still I know this has been said a dozen times, but I gotta do it anyway.

Your dad is a good egg.
Keep us posted when they hatch!!
Good on dad for having all his ducks in a row.
Lots of eggs coming this year, no doubt!
I really love the pond! It's really beautiful.
Gonna need a live stream!
Adorable. A nursing pond all to themselves!
This duck knows she‚Äôs a queen sitting upon an ornate throne
RemindMe! 30 days
I love him so much üò≠. When dads go out of their way to make an animal‚Äôs existence better, my heart explodes into confetti. It‚Äôs truly my favorite thing. This ones for the Dads üçª
I would personally nest and lay eggs in that garden let alone the ducklings. So beautiful
The best addition to any home garden: A resident duck.
Awww, you guys are awesome, can‚Äôt wait to see the babies!
Your dad rocks. Stay safe.
This guy ducks
Please keep us updated!!!
Would love to see the rest of that backyard oasis.
Beautiful üòç
I have to hand it to OP for taking this so well. Most people aren't nearly as understanding when they find out their father has a second family somewhere.
You should cross post this to r/gardening, this back yard space is gorgeous. I‚Äôm sure they will appreciate the duckies
Please post a video/picture when the ducks arrive!
We have this happen in/around our pool each year.  We have two ducks who come and make a nest on the far side of the pool.  Oddly enough a third duck shows up every year and the two males (I'm assuming because they are more colorful) fight each other.  I have them filmed somewhere but it gets quite violent.  They are very fine with my presence as long as I stay far enough away.  One time the ducklings ran toward me but Mommy wrangled them up.
r/HumansBeingBros
Very bro of your dad
Please post the ducklings when they come!
She's giving you the stink eye. Nothing meaner than a broody bird.
Tony soprano would be proud.
As the apex animal of Planet Earth; it should be our duty to hook up animals.
Two things:

1 - your dad is an awesome person

2 - you realize we are going to need to see this happen, right?
Your Dad is adorable! Such sweetness!
Awwww your dad and his Buddha statues are looking out for them ü•∞I‚Äôm sure the waterfall sound is very relaxing for the mom ducky.
Your dad is awesome for doing this.  I'm looking forward to your promised updates.
Show us again when they come!
Imagine being so compassionate that ducks rely on your background as a safe haven to have their children. That is awesome.
I'm gonna need daily updates on the baby ducks, please and thanks.
He‚Äôs got his ducks in a row
I'm definitely going to need a follow up to this. ‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs like a duck love hotel.
Hope to see vids when they do arrive
I think my dad and your dad would be fantastic friends. My parents have a couple acres and are frequently visited by a couple deer. My dad can tell them apart, has elevated feeders placed around the property for them, buys them special food, and saves all of our produce ends/extras for them. A couple of them have names and he calls them ‚Äúmy girls‚Äù. One time we were at Trader Joe‚Äôs and he was so excited by the low prices (he had never been) he said ‚Äú89 cents for carrots!!? I‚Äôm going to get some for the girls!‚Äù aka the deer.
TIL I wanna be this duck.
Duckling pics please
The lucky duck inn is open for business.
I think your dad is tony soprano
Precious. I never ever comment, but this gives my heart pure hope and joy. Thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
Faith in humanity: restored
Glad you installed that little grassy step to help wildlife escape the pond! So thoughtful!
Yeah please do updates. Would love to buy your dad a beer.
That pond is cool as fuck
Love it!
Good to tony soprano survived the last episode
Your dad and Tony Soprano could have been duck parent bffs!
This guy ducks
I love this.  It's so awesome when people go the extra mile like this.  Plus it's a gorgeous set up.
Tony Soprano is living his best life
Looks like a mother ducking paradise.
It would be cool for an update on the future little ones ü§©
His set up for them is adorable that‚Äôs such a nice little pond!
What a mf bad ass!! Much love!!üòÜ

Praise the duckling cat walk!

Wow. You can tell he really gives a quack.
Eat your heart out, Tony Soprano
That has to be the most zen place iv'e ever seen.
Sounds like he has his ducks in a row

ugh. i wish the ducks fully understood what he was doing so they would ALWAYS come here and tell their friends to come here. it's awful what some apartment complexes all over the US have done to get rid of geese and ducks. love me some quacks.
good soul he is
Do you want reddit followers? Because this is how you get reddit followers.
Good man your dad is
Oh snap I remember you posting about this in the last year or two! This is great!
I‚Äôve never heard of ducks doing this, how amazing! Do they not get frightened by the proximity to humans? Does your dad stay well away or do they let him come and go in the garden when the chicks are about? So interesting!
Your father's amazing and please, please update us. I'm sure that no one's asked for that....
I need an update!
It would be sick if these ducks flew back and forth between these kinds of setups. Kind of like a summer home/winter home type situation and two different dads maintaining both.
Video after they come back please? Your Dad is a good egg.
Carmella! The ducks!
Tell him his Acer looks great!

There‚Äôs a distinct lack of Tony Soprano references in this thread.
Now you've done it, op! We're all invested!
I could see why they choose this  it's a sweet little Haven your  dad got  set up for little future duckies and their parents.
Do you want ducks?

'Cuz this is how you get ducks.
Are ducks nest defenders? Do that get sassy if you get close or are they used to you after a couple of years worth of visits?
Is your dad the boss of New Jersey by any chance?
I would nest there too. All relax looking.
I couldn't possibly love this more
It reminds me of The sopranos when Tony took care of the ducks that nested in his pool.
I would watch a live stream webcam of this yard daily.
I swear if I don‚Äôt see and update I‚Äôm going to loose all hope
Is your dad Tony Soprano?
!remindme 3 weeks
This garden is gorgeous.
Love it. Currently worried about the office geese. They've been nesting there for several years now, but Covid has us all home, meaning the office is now a landscaped ghost town. I hope there's enough activity to keep the predators away.
I can see why she chose that garden. It's gorgeous and well kempt.
Ducks out for harambe
Is his name Tony Soprano?
Tony Soprano in another life lol
Well that's just really neat! Need to make some videos as this progresses!
Is your dad Tony soprano?
Does he have fish?
This is so wonderful.  My grandpa absolutely loved ducks.  He had a lot when I was growing up.   He would get so giddy when they'd have little ones.
Tony soprano would be so happy
You should give John Krasinski this story so he can put it on his Good News show.
Exactly what I needed to see today! Absolutely beautiful :)
That's great what he is doing for the ducks, but I'd also just like to say, that is a beautiful backyard.
This family of ducks coming each year is the only Duck Dynasty I‚Äôm interested in seeing.   Also is there any way to unobtrusively install a camera to see them hatch and move around?  I think if you had a Live YouTube feed, the viewership, especially during this pandemic, would be broad and positive.
Your dad is a lovely man. I look forward to updates.
This makes my heart happy!
Totally following you for your dad's duck updates. Cheers to the lovely entertainment during the times we're all going through. ^_^
I want to go to your house and feed them peas. 

Heck I want to go anywhere  at this point in my life.
üíã for your dad, because he didn‚Äôt have to, and he did!
Not that I know much about ducks, but I question this because then he'd have the entire family of ducks from last year back this year.
I want to smoke weed with your dad
More videos of the ducks, please.
I love your dad!
This really made me said aww out loud
When one feels like a duck, one is happy!
i like your garden
A simple long board would have suffice.
This is like a momma duck‚Äôs Utopia.
this is so sweet. I want to be one of the ducks chilling there!
Tony is that you
this really makes me go awwwww

This really warms the heart. Your dad is a very kind person.

That is adorable.  Also your dad has my dream pond, lol.

I hope you can post pics when he gets the ducks!
I mean that is a great place to have babies!
Your dad is the hero we all need right now
That‚Äôs so sweet. It looks like such a cozy and safe place for her to have her ducklings.  Thank you for sharing!!
*Dad:* "I dont want a duck."

*Dad after getting duck:*
Good man. That is amazing. Now we just need to get him a camera for a livestream. That is some tranquility.
We'll need follow up pics and videos
Those must be the most zen ducks in the world
This is amazing props to your Dad, please post updates!
Very exciting

OMG!!!! If I was a duck... I‚Äôd for SURE come to your dad‚Äôs garden and pond!! It looks like HEAVEN for a momma duck&her babies!!
Your dad is good people.
I love this and I love your dad for doing it. Reminds me of something my own dad would do :) those are some very lucky ducks!
Please follow up!
I'm not often visited by a pair of ducks.  But when I do, I am not the father, and you can't prove a thing.
For quarantine they put rent on his bill.
This is wonderful. I love ducks.
We have had a pair of ducks every year  for 5 years now. No babies though. They are Ross and Rachel. I clearly need a pond like this. I‚Äôll inform my husband. He‚Äôll be thrilled.
What an awesome thing to do
So beautiful!
What a sweet man! Please update when they're enjoying the setup üòä
very holy.
My daughter would LOVE this.
Good job üëè
Your Dad is awesome... how cool that they come back
What's the deal with the Tony soprano comments?
Your dad's Tony soprano
I just love it when someone like your father notices nature in his own surroundings and gently, naturally as possible tries to replicate that, therefore hoping the ducks will be comfortable enough to return. Your father is a very cool guy!
Aren‚Äôt ducklings supposed to take leaps of faith to learn? Getting spoiled by papa
Wild to think people love this kind of stuff then go and eat animals which necessitate unimaginable suffering for their entire lives.

Surely if you like animals youd want to NOT pay people to hurt them and raise them in horribly cruel environments
This duck lives better than I do...
That's the kind of wholesomeness I needed today!
I also have a couple ducks that are my perennial friends. I call them Wingus and Dingus
I saw a tiger...
!RemindMe 1 month
Now I understand the term "lucky duck".
Cool!  It's like a training pond for the ducklings. Do the ducklings stay until they can fly away?
Nice pond. Do he have livestock?
Beautiful
God, I absolutely love your dad!!!!!üíúüíúüíú
I love your dad.
He's a good duck daddy ‚ù§
I love this! And what a beautiful, peaceful garden!
This is so sweet :) Be sure to tell your dad Reddit approves his kindness to animals.
I love your dad!
Please show us when they hatch!
Impressive maternity ward
That's very nice.
Thanks for posting! Reminds me of the sopranos episode 1!
Nice Acer trees too :)
Perfect spot - next to Buddha.
The sound in this video makes me thirsty
I hope he realizes in a few years he will be literally over run with ducks. They always come back and he will have hundreds in a few short years. Ive seen this happen multiple times to people. good luck
Please provide regular updates!!
I need updates
I love your dad, what a beautiful thing to do. 
And that pond looks amazing, no wonder they chose it :)
Please please please ask him to get a video of those little ducklings walking down the path he made. I need it. We need it. The world needs it.
That‚Äôs just so harmonious.
Don‚Äôt let him pick journey on the jukebox when y‚Äôall go back out to eat.
She must trust your dad in some capacity. How sweet
Ah! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!
Oh that's so cuteüòç
Very sweet!
I love this so much
This is adorable. But also Duck cam please?
Please post once the  ducks show up! Remind him!
Ducks will return over and over to a place that feels safe. At my university, there is a pair that makes a nest by the fountain each year and launches the little ones into the fountain. I don't know what the groundskeepers think about it, but I find it charming.
Can you set up a duck cam so we can all watch them grow up?!?!
Instert Tony Soprano comment here
Give the man some grandchildren
This duck living like 0.001% of elite duck population
You must keep us updated.
What a classy dude.
Imagine finding a breeding ground with your mate, only to find out that it is already the home of giants, but then you find out the giants enjoy your company so much they create and build a sanctuary that is predator free and designed for your offspring to flourish. It'd be like that old family cabin that goes back for generations, except protected by the gods and its a flowery watery paradise.
Very sweet
House goals ... as long as my yard looks anything like this I can live in a box.
I love this so much. Mom and dad duck know it‚Äôs a safe place to have their babies so they coming back.. heartwarming
Please please show when the ducks arrive. Keep updating as the ducklings grow. Would watch that every day.
This is the duck equivalent of winning the lottery
/r/thisiswhatweneedrightnow
I hope we can meet the babies!
A man after my own heart!  Great job dad!
That's pretty cool
Will need post birth cute duckling videos
Damn, nice. I get wild ducks in my yard, but my concern is where the mom can bring the babies when they are ready for big water. Do you have a close-by water body? Where does she bring the babies after?
If this happened to me I'd be excited every year
Be sure to post when they do show up.
Keep Reddit updated!
Is it a fenced in garden that they fly into? Thatd be cute to watch the ducklings learn to fly
Your dad is Tony Soprano? He lives!
The collective term for ducks is a 'Paddling'
I have immediately become fully invested in your dad‚Äôs ducks. I need all the updates.
Playing Animal Crossing IRL
EEEEEEEeeeeeee!!!!! I LOVE THIS SO HARD!!! Fabulous! Thank you to you and your dad! 

I would love to see more!
I think we're all gonna need updates or there will be blood
Your dad seems so adorable
Gonna need a follow-up!
!remindme 1 year
Aw, he's a duck uncle.
Weekly updates to r/aww or you're not welcome anymore!
Yeah, apparently ducks tend to return to the same place each year. 

We had ducks in our pool last year.  I was all excited.  My dad was shooing them away, while I was trying to take pictures. He said it's been the same pair for a few years now.
Wait, don't ducks fly??
Why do they need a ramp..?
This is so beautiful. I love the green water ramp, every pool/pond should have one. Thank you for sharing this.
My day is infinitely better after seeing this.
He should add a little slide! Have you seen the video of ducklings going down a slide? They love it!
Is your dad Tony Soprano?
Wtf. Is this his backyard? Dayum.
This makes me so happy!
Part 2 when?
This is such a dad thing to do and it‚Äôs wonderful
That just makes my heart happy!
Sorry about your dads future panic attacks
That is very beautiful, it made me think of [this](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=15hmkMjJBwM)
This is why they return. They are serious clever birds. I had one as a house pet for 13 years.
I‚Äôm here strictly for the Soprano‚Äôs comments
Do they poop everywhere?
We need a live stream of this ASAP!!!!!

Progress reports.. Names etc..etc..
My mom had a couple ducks put up residence in her pool. They were so cute, it was so fun watching them happily swimming and resting. 

But we had to keep them from coming to the pool, they shit absolutely everywhere.
I have so many ducks to give about this
What‚Äôs he zooming in on? Oh!
Omg this is sooooo cute!!
I love the Zen pond! Beautiful! üòç
Lucky!
I want updates
That. Is. So. FUCKING ADORABLE.
Your dad is a good person
He looks filthy rich
This pond on its own is absolutely amazing, love your Dad‚Äôs yard. As a side note, the thought of your Dad going to a hardware store to buy all of these landscaping materials with the sole purpose and motivation to be to provide a top notch labor and delivery ward for two individual ducks is like coffee for my soul.
Last year they didn't have the fountain.
Carmella is gonna be pissed.
So sweet
Just make sure you‚Äôre prepared for that one year they just don‚Äôt come back. Happened to tony soprano and happened to me as a kid, broke my heart. Or better yet, maybe don‚Äôt prepare for it, because then it‚Äôll always just be tearing at the back of your mind and you won‚Äôt get to enjoy the time when they are there.
This is so wholesome!
sweet
I have yard ducks and I love it.
Your Dad's garden is zen af, and goals...cheers to him!
We‚Äôve had a pair of ducks hang around the parking lot at my work for a couple days the last three years in a row. It‚Äôs always around this time of year. They just come and use it as a pit stop and then keep flying north I think.
...this year‚Äôs harvest...err brood
So sweet ü•∞
I am now invested in this. Please make progress posts in the future
these ducks are the 1% lol i luv your dad btw !

Those ducks think your dad is a benevolent diety

Sorry about your dad stealing your cat dad.
So cool! And that pond!! üòç (Actually, all the landscaping. It‚Äôs duck heaven!)
Please please please keep us updated on them ducklings
What kind of fish are in the pond?
All I can picture is Tony Soprano
I was entranced enough at the setup that I didn't even notice the duck until my second repeat of the video.
Is his name Tony by any chance?
My parents had a mama duck come nest in their yard for a few years, but last year a skunk came and ate up the eggs üò© little egg pieces all over and my parents were so sad
You're dad is a righteous dude. Abide.
Nice
I love your dad.
Thanks for this.
Wow nice, free food delivery.
I‚Äôm going to need updates OP

Edit: I will literally follow you on Reddit if you supply me with ducks
Tony Soprano!!
Fuckin love it!
One of the things I really like about my apartment community is that we have a lake attached to the back end of the complex and it attracts a lot of water foul, and for the last few years some very colorful and interesting ducks have taken a liking to our community. It's always great to see them with their little ones waddling about.
Please update when they hatch
aw, I love your dad! so thoughtful!

Thanks for sharing, these little flickers of wholesomeness really brighten these rather dark days!
I love this!  How fun that they come back each year!  ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

That‚Äôs awesome, I would love for my backyard to be home to some migratory birds. When I was little we sometimes would get Dove and other birds nests and it was always fun watching them
He should fashion some sort of rope rail, for going up the steps. üëçüèª
Your dad has an awesome looking garden.
So, what you are saying, is your dad is Tony Soprano.
We had like five baby ducks die because they had no way to get out of the pond. It was soo sad and it good to see the measures taken to prevent that.
I would build one of those if I knew that ducks would come.
That's so cool!
Tony Soprano wants to know your dad's location
This guy gets it.
That's awesome:) Make sure no racoons get up there..:(
Does he have anything readied if there are stray cats in the neighborhood?

I would love to have baby ducks visiting my garden!
Cool
Nice. Welcome Mr. & Mrs. Duck.

The equivalent to my Sims family where each generation moves into their childhood home and raises their children. It's so sweet... The ducklings probably remember dad's pond as a happy, safe place a d come back to have their own kids.
Congrats on your duck siblings! That pond/fountain is stunning btw
The problem in this country is that too few ducks have too much.

In the 60s, ducks were pretty evenly spread over crappy nesting sites, but as the duck lobby continued we saw ever increasing duck estates among a decreasing elite, while the majority of ducks saw no improvement in their nests. 

Let me say that again: 98% of ducks have seen ZERO improvement in their nesting since 1960.

This quackery has to stop, and it starts with taxing ducks like THIS their FAIR SHARE. No one NEEDS that much fountain space.

This makes me sick.
keep us posted
The wholesome tony soprano
Please keep updating this! I want to see the little quackers grow!
Keep us updated
A good example of respect of animal life :)
For small animals there are a lot of dangers in human environment you don't think of. So making your house, garden and stuff barrier free not only for disabled but also for small animals is a good thing.
Ah, the duck life
That‚Äôs very generous of him. Cleaning duck poop out of the water is annoying and gross because they $hit all the time! Not my favorite but your dad it adorable in how he‚Äôs caring for them already!
The soothing sound of flowing water automatically lowers my BP reading by 20 points. Good luck with this year‚Äôs brood.
I also would like to nest there
Please update when the ducks and ducklings arrive!
Remind me one year
Tony soprano? That you?
Your dad must be a god to these ducks. So cool.
Live Duck cam feed 24/7 please

Edit: typo, for once it did F instead of D
Your dad has a good soul
Does the moving water keep mosquitos out of it?
Easily amongst the top 10 landlords
Does you dad have enough budas? I feel like he needs more budas.
Amazing. Those ducks hit the jackpot. *quackpot*
Everyone‚Äôs talking about Tony Soprano and here I am wondering if he‚Äôs Austin from Gardenscapes.
Makes me wonder how parks get ducks and geese. Do they just show up on their own or are they introduced to them by humans? ü§î I know that park ponds have human introduced fish in them, as a natural way of maintaining the cleanliness of the water, but are the birds also part of that human-influenced ecosystem?
I think your dad is amazing!  And I think I can speak for most everyone here....we need pics of the babies when they hatch!!
Your dad is amazing !

Edit: wish i had one
Get him a WEBCAM! Stream it live, 24/7... lets see these ducks turn into tweens!
Ducks usually always return to their birthplace to continue the cycle of life.
That's a beautiful pond, so relaxing! The ducks will be very happy, thanks for sharing :)
This is awesome üòá
Your dad is a good man
Please come back with an update once they hatch!
r/humansbeingbros
It's so awesome! More people need to welcome animals like this. After all the habitat they've lost.
Where is this?
This makes me happy.  Thank you.  Thank your dad!
God bless him
Ducks are the best people.
You better come back with an update when they hatch!
That is an amazing water garden. Your dad is a very talented man.
I didn't see the duck there until the 3rd time I watched it
That is so cute! A few duck families come to a fountain in a courtyard where I work every spring. I‚Äôve always wondered what they ate there since it‚Äôs not a real pond.
My parents have a similar situation, the ducks have been making babies going on 5 years now
God bless your dad
Ducks are my favourite. Bygosh, I had better see an update of said ducklings
This, but with bees.
By God you had better send us updates or so help me.....
Definitely post a clip of the ducklings when they  hatch! Do they swim around in the pool? How long do they stick around after they've hatched? The only thing I am worried about is if one of those bricks from the walkway falls and injures the duck and ducklings. But I am sure it's very secure. That pond and garden looks epic!
Oh man, we are seriously going to need to see these ducks when they arrive!
That is gorgeous, my dad would be so jealous of those Japanese maples!
You think he would mind if some geese set up a nest over there?
Is your dad tony soprano?

Didn't know I was a duck.
Would love to see youtube video updates on this. I think everyone would enjoy seeing the ducklings use what your dad set up!
Is your dad Tony Soprano?
Tell your dad that he is awesome.
I have the same exact same thing happen each year too!! Except for ducks it‚Äôs barn swallows, and except for a beautiful serene back yard pond, it‚Äôs above my mud and bird shit covered front door!
Omg this is so sweet!! Your dad seems awesome!
How stinking sweet!
Too bad your awesome dad is not our President, we could use a guy like this right now :-)
Not only does your dad have a killer ass backyard, but DUCKS, too?!
Does he have the makings of a varsity athlete?
Does your dad happen to be a capo in the North New Jearsey mob?
That is so sweet! :D
Sopranos theme starts playing
This used to happen with my great uncle who lives in Georgetown. He had ducks visit him every spring for almost 10 years, then one year they just stopped.
What a good man your dad is. Mama looks so safe and comfortable.
Geese could learn a thing or two.
That's great! I've seen worse ramps signed off by osha
Ok this is now a dream of mine.
Queue the Sopranos references.
Freaking awesome!! Them some lucky ducks. I'm jealous.
This is sincerely wholesome content. Please tell your dad thank you from the internet.
Is your dad Tony Soprano?
Love the Buddha statues

Adorable I can't wait for the update that shows them using the stuff your dad left out
That duck face on the sentry was mad af
One fat hen...
This would be a cool live stream.
Is your dad Tony Soprano?
We did a similar this, our pond had a deck around it so the ducks couldnt get out. My dad built a ramp and attached it to the deck so the little duckies didnt get trapped
I hope the ducks still come this year. If not 2020 might just break him.
Tell your dad to watch out for the guy in the Members Only jacket at the end of season 6.
The way your dad takes care of those ducks, he might be a mob boss!
Ducks also like fresh fruit in addition to grains and seeds.
We had a duck couple visit our backyard which would flood every spring for over 20 years, never had a family though
This is AWESOME!! Thank you for sharing the smiles.
Like their own little oasis pretty dope.
I love ducks so much! I envy your dad, I wish I could give these cuties a place to stay and raise their little ones
I JUST got back from spying on our complex‚Äôs mama goose. Can‚Äôt wait for her babies!
If The Sopranos has taught me anything, it's that even the toughest man can be brought to his knees by duckies in his back yard.
This rules
A man of vision
When it is time I need a update if the ducks came back
Meanwhile other ducks.

Is your dad Tony Soprano?
"I wonder what the *poor* ducks are doing? Hahahahaha! Timmons! More corn!" - That duck, probably.
This is my favorite thing on Reddit all week.
gee i wish i was that duck
Ooh ducklings!
For the past 4 or 5 years these 2 ducks have came and sunbathed and swam in my pool. I guess they could be different but it makes me feel better thinking they come back every year.
is this your dad?

Please post updates! I really want to see the little ones.

This is awesome. Wildlife looses so much habitat I think people with yards need to  give back as much as possible. Your dad's the best. So are you for sharing the video.
Wait till those ducks tell their friends... and those friends tell some geese...
this is absolutely wonderful. So pure.
YOU ARE ALL A FAMILY NOWüñ§
Your father happen to be Tony Soprano?

Omg that's a beautiful setup! These are some lucky ducks!! Can't wait for ducpdates!!
I wanna see the duckies
We‚Äôre going to need regular updates OP
Keep us updated
We've had a similar thing with skunks. A family of skunks comes every year to raise the babies. Our neighbors hate it but we don't give af. The skunk babies are pretty cute and they don't do anything to you if you just leave them alone.
What an absolute legend!
Tony Soprano would be so proud
Tony?
Is your dad a sanitation consultant?
Your dad is a good man.
Tony Soprano would love this.
