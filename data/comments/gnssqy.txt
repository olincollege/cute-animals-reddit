I love the way he gives a little kiss back! It's such a beautiful bond between the two of you!
Aww look at the way he looks at you, he loves you.
I've watched this three times just because it make me smile and if I wasn't such a Luddite I'd save it to watch on days I feel like shit so I feel less like shit. Thanks!
This made me smile. Take good care of each other.
Puppy love! You guys made for each other.
This is adorable and you are adorable!
I love other dudes who aren't afraid to be affectionate with their pets. They love us unconditionally, so it's only right we reflect that love back. Good on you sir! I wish you and your pup many years of vibing and playing.
That is the sweetest thing I've seen in God knows how long.
Oh 





My






God








THAT WAS SO ADORABLE
It’s the little things in life that are the most precious! Congrats!
You both have the same beautiful brown eyes. Congrats on your new fur baby.
SO CUTE! <3
Oh, my heartttttt 🥰
You 2 look like you're going to have a great life together - thanks for sharing
You look so happy bro!  Congrats!  Dogs rule!   When it comes to nutrition, don't cheap out on dog food.  Get the good stuff....dog will be healthier and live longer.  My dogs eat better than me!
If we all could just spread this kind of love around.  Sweetest thing ever!! 

you're a PAWsome furdaddy.
Aw! That little boop back! Looks like you're best buds already! <3
Love it. You two take care of each other and have fun on your adventures out there!
This is the most heartwarming thing I have ever seen
This is fucking adorable
Man, I know that giggle. I do it every time I’m playing with my pup and it’s literally born out of pure unadulterated joy. It’s not like any other moment.

Well I don’t have kids, so I’m sure there’s a parallel (or greater)  there
He kissed you back 🥺
Yes officer, it's these two over here, they stole my heart!
For all of you wondering, his name Is Tiger, he is 13 weeks old and this video was recorded a while back when he was only 8 weeks.
Adorable 😁
You two are already so sweet! I’m so happy for you both. You’re only going to keep bringing each other more love!
"He gave me a kiss baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack\~" <3
My heart needed this beautiful bit of wholesome! The kiss-back was ADORABLE and OPs excited reaction was everything! It’s true love!
So cute! The both of ya!!! Hahahaha
Y'all are cute as duck.
What a cutie!!
So cute!
Hey cool pupper! What breed is it? I love that type of dog but never knew the name of the breed
This is the kind of bond where you leave for 10 minutes and they go apeshit to see your face again! This is just beautiful. ❤️
Fuuuuuccck I wanna dog that gives me kisses.
Somebody has a new BFF.
Here, take my vote!
You two are so cute together! My son found a puppy that looks exactly like yours. They are also the best of friends!
You’re both so cute! Congrats on your lil babes, I hope you guys enjoy each other’s company ❤️
The bliss on both the owner's face and the dog's is so wholesome!
This is the most wholesome thing ever! It made me smile from my heart!!
Quarantine has been a great thing for the cats in our household. I figured out that our boys were extremely bored. Probably why we always came home to trash everywhere after work before this. So I ordered them some new toys, found and cleaned up all of the cat toy stashes, and ordered this automatic laser. I set it everyday so it turns on every two hours for 15 minutes. They here it ‘beep’ when it turns on and comes running. It’s just long enough that they tend to wander off and take a nap after, or come snuggle us when done. We haven’t had to deal with nearly the same amount of bad behavior from them as we did before.
how sweet!
We STAN
You can see the innocence and content ness in the dog’s eyes ❤️
Best buds, love it
Omgoodness, awww, look at the way he looks at you, you are his most favourite thing ever...you'll never feel lonely or unloved again with him by your side.
Brindle is best! Cute dog man
Awwww,, here’s to many happy years with your new friend!
This just made my morning!
Oh, those little kisses you shared...💜
Snuggling with a puppy let’s them know they are part of your pack now, and you will keep them safe and happy. It’s always the best thing to do.

And it’s adorable. May you have many happy years with your new best friend !
Doggy is so cute
HE LOVES YOU!!!
What breed is your pup?
This is so wholesome.
That actually made me smile
That is so wholesome and cute!!!!!!!!
This is some high quality wholesome shit right here.
 Best friends!!
That was adorable
Congrats! this is so cute
“He gave me a kiss back!” My heart exploded in my chest.
This is busy like mu cat and me. Made me smile :)
Lotta love in this little video.
From a 50 year old guy, that’s cute. 

Puppies are awesome. 

He’s at the perfect age to start training too. Fetch, lay, down, up, stand, nose, bump (fist bump), sit, stop, ok... all sorts of things that will make life much easier as he gets older. 

My daughter uses cooked, diced (1/4” cubes) and frozen pieces of chicken breast as training reward. One piece for each successful command. 

After getting him to repeat the command ten times in a row, you can start backing off on the rewards. You want the dog to follow the command even if they don’t always get a reward. Her service dog now only gets a chicken reward only during reinforcement training and even then only about every other or third success. 

Good luck!
I get my pup in two weeks and I can’t wait. Time is ticking so slow. I haven’t had a dog since my last bud passed away in 2017. I’m ready for that love again. This is a precious video. You can tell he loves you already. thank you for sharing.
Can i just suggest you leave the collar off the pup when he is around the house i always say this as i had a little pup who accidentally hung herself on a tree branch while she was jumping. Gorgeous little dote !
Congrats!  Love them right and they’ll change your life for the better.  Looks like you’re already seeing that :)
he is so smoolll
i want a puppy too:(
This is so dang heartwarming! Dogs are the best, enjoy my friend!!

Yep good looking dog
Wow! I adopted a puppy about 2 weeks ago and these two could be twins!!!
Hey you-
Reddit approves-
he totally did.
You must be a very good friend because if I got that puppy I wouldn't be able to give him/her to anyone!!
congrats on your boi!
Aww he loves you!
You are both adorable!
That reciprocal muzzle bump after you kissed pupper made my heart melt!
Awesome!
He kissed you back!
Damn, that’s cute. If you don’t mind me asking, what type of dog is it? My friend has a beagle that looks just like him.
awwwww
You are both utterly adorable
I don't know who's more precious tbh
We don't deserve dogs
Wait till its grown up and starts giving (block) head bumps. The best
Thats awesome. The pup completely imitated you with the kiss. Best friend for life
Very sweet! You both look smitten. Puppies can be challenging. Be patient as you grow as a family unit.
You look so happy Bro, really happy for you. You have a buddy for life right there.
the little kiss made my heart do a happy somersault
This is so sweet!
I wish I didn’t mind fur all over the place.
Sweet little boop
There it is, the most wholesome thing on Reddit today
Good God, you and that puppy are adorable. “*gasp* He gave me a kiss back!” 😭 belongs in r/MadeMeSmile
That's just wholesome AF.
This is the most adorable thing. 

The little guy is lucky to have an owner who loves him so much!
Pure love <3
My heart!!! ❤ adorable
Puppies are the best, then before you know it, you have a best friend. Enjoy your friend..
HE KISSED YOU BACK OMG!
Idk why i thought you would have a British accent so your accent surprised me hahaha
Too sweet! You guys are already a great duo :)
He’s precious. What a darling loving pooch.
John Boyega, is that you?
Sooo cuteee
Awww, bless
ngl they do be vibin 😳
Sweetest shit I've seen today
Thanks op
His excitement is the cutest part
AW
Awwwwwwweewewwww
What’s his name? This is so precious!
My cat used to do this! But then we got a new dog and now he hates me lmao
Awesome video my man!! :) Thanks for the smile!
you gave him a kissy and he gave you one back!! little darling <3 what's his/her name?
Great vibes!
Best part is, when you’re actually sad, and make those noises for real.  The reaction will be the same.  Quiet giggling and quiet sobbing sound a lot a like for dogs.
Exactly what I needed to start the day!
So a word of advice. Get out during this quarantine time away from the dog. The dog needs to get used to you not being around at times. If you’re home for a month straight and then go back to work and are gone for periods of time, it won’t turn out well.
I hope you cherish this new family member with your heart. I lost a pet and a very good friend today. Make memories so you can cherish them forever. It’s nice to see people beginning their new friendships.
My heart...
This gave me the biggest smile. Thank you for sharing! 🥰
You look like a kid I go to school with lmao, congratulations on the pup!
This melts my heart. So cutee!
This is so fucking cute I’m now the happiest person in the world and nothing can stop me oh my god my heart is so full
Oh my god this is so cute
Zion, is that you?
I suggest watching some dog training videos on YouTube and REALLY start training that sit, place, etc NOW. It will make dog teenage years SO MUCH MORE BEARABLE! 
I was taken off work for 2 months when my dog was just coming up to one year old and she was WILD. Didn’t walk on a leash because I thought training her to walk beside me was better, had zero recall and would laugh when I said sit. I took her to a dog park every single morning for two months and trained her on leash. I have some experience with horses and ended up accidentally “clicker” training her with my tongue clicks. She’s now 8 and comes when I click my tongue without fail! We are now working on distractions because she’s perfect most of the time on leash but if there’s a dog she wants to say hi to, she forgets I exist.
Grown man being silly with a puppy.  Priceless and beautiful❤
He kissed you back. You have been chosen. You are as much his/hers as they are yours.
Puppies are the most beautiful beings in the world! 😍
Not everyone deserves to have a dog. You are clearly the kind of person who does. I’m glad that pupper found a sweet friend like you.
I chose the wrong speices again didnt i
Putting in the time and effort with a dog is soo worth it! They give it all back in love and loyalty 10x over. Sooo sweet! Advice: Definitely pay at a vet to have him microchipped. If he ever gets lost and ends up in a shelter he will make his way back to you :)
This is so sweet.
omg the dog kissed you back
Oh my God you guys are awesome! Enjoy your new friend!
Oh my goodness! You two are quite the pair.
Two handsome fellows :)
SO 

FUCKIN

WHOLESOMMMMMMMME
Which one is the puppy?
I'm crying! So cute!
You're both cute!
Spend the time and effort now to train him (books or websites) and you'll have your best friend for life.

Also, read up on limiting food intake during his first year.
two legends look at each other
guard dog
Finn finally found a good loyal friend! What's the pup's name?
Ahhh! He’s so cute! One of my dogs looked like him as a puppy!
Holy Crap I was not expecting this much praise! Thank you for the upvotes and awards!
Tip of advice, doubt you'll see it but gotta try.

Puppies need a ton of sleep. A ton. They "act up" and "become a terror" when they don't get their sleep.

We're talking more than 14 hours a day.

But they won't sleep a lot of the time if everyone is up and about or exciting things are happening.

Get a crate or if you can set aside an area of a room with their bed in it, and have several designated nap times through the day. Those puppy terror moments will be few and far between if the pupper gets it's proper rest.

Also, if they start getting super amped up, it's fine if it's play time, but have a signal or command to tell them when play times over and it's time to calm down. Adult dogs bark or growl at their puppers for this. For our pup we use "bah" almost like a growl Since it doesn't sound like common words.

This will help your pup learn to reset and calm down instead of staying amped up and eventually possibly stressed out.

Best of luck! Enjoy your new family member!

Tl;Dr: Puppies need lots of sleep and help with stress relief or they act out.
So are we getting regular updates or an Instagram page?!?!
Congrats. You will NEVER find another dog more loving.

My dog gives me the same "I love you forever" look with his eyes when he spoons me in bed. These dogs live the good life!!
That’s adorable
Made my day thanks 😊
Best friends for life!! What his name?
That one damn cute pup
What a perfect puppy!! What’s their name?
This is so wholesome
Aww how cute!
Oh the dog's okay too I guess...
I WOULD DIE FOR BOTH OF YOU.
Congrats on getting a furry child!
You two are adorable together.

“You kiss me, I bop you back”

Puppy see, puppy do.
Love this!
WHEN YOU KISS HIM HE KISSES YOU BACK! Oh lord.

edit - I just put the sound on and realised that exactly what you said, haha. You're cute as heck together.
Omg that puppy is doing all the things you're doing! I can't even... 

Thank you
Omg when you kissed his nose and he responded by booping you with his snout, my HEART 😭😭😭
I love how he kisses you back immediately ❤️
Omg the love!! So precious, y’all are adorable!!!
Aww how endearing. That’s so sweet. 🥰
You two are adorable!!

You two are too cute! ❤
Is that a pibble? Come over to r/velvethippos.
Okay but why did I tear up
Adorable! Looks like a Boxer?
If he is...you'll wonder why you took so long! 
Congratulations on the new family member!
Just remember, what he learns now is what he'll do later. My parents let the puppies on the bed & couches and when they were huge it was that nice having the big ass dog thinking it can hop on the couch and snuggle on your lap.

My dogs never knew that they can climb on the bed or the couch so they are happy on their super comfy dog beds.
This is adorable, we need more!
man op that pup is so cute but my heart melted seeing how much you love him and he loves you 😭 you’re the perfect pair!
The head tilt when you started talking made me watch it 5 times

I love that excited intake of breath when he kissed you back. Wholesome

Outside of getting potty training down I can't understand why some dog owners don't want their puppies/dogs on the bed like that. I have 2 and it's the best, they're live teddy bears.

That was a positively healing, comforting, hope-inducing, tear-jerking, sweet little video. I think 62,000+ people and me all needed that today. I hope this gets reposted regularly. I just had a snuggle session with my dogs, here on the complete other side of the world. They give us much needed emotional and mental support.
That little puppy kiss back was the cutest thing ever
Cute
Omgomgomgomg. So cute. Looks like my baby as a baby!!!!
Mirin’ you
You look so happy it's warming my heart
Brindle pitties are the best!! Too cute!
Awwww. Man kisses puppy, puppy kisses man. So sweet.
Awwwwwe!!!
You guys are so freaking cute together!
Aww such a cute pup! I’ve been thinking about getting a dog. What type of dog is it?
Awwww, so adorable!
Looks like an adorable bond. But make sure (if you're a first time owner) that you teach him about separation so he doesn't get seperation anxiety later on. 

What kinda breed will he be?

And my dog gives kisses back too. It's such a wonderful feeling!
That little tilt of his head after he gives you his kiss. So cute!
Perspective really messed with me on that one. I thought it was a way bigger dog, further behind you. 

I am deeply concerned you haven't posted enough of him though, gonna need say... 5-6 more gifs?
BRO THIS CUTE AS FUCK
HE KISSED YOU BACK OH MY LORD

Your best life!
You are so lucky*
How old is that puppy? What spell did you use to get it so chill? Ours is almost 14 weeks and she would be eating my face like she was on bath salts.
Adorable
He will be your best friend. My advice, watch your tone, he/she will do things that are upsetting cause ya know, they’re a puppy. But any traumatic yelling or over the top discipline will not be forgotten by the pup when he’s grown up.

No one is perfect though. And irrespective if you love and care for that pup, it will be your best friend.

I love my pup. Yours is very sweet and handsome. Good luck!
that's adorable dude! may you guys have many happy years together.
Awwwww
This is so p u r e
This is soooo precious
Aww
I hope you two have a great friendship for life!

Wholesome as frick. ❤️
That’s going to be your best friend for a long time. Cherish it.
That is pretty friggin' sweet. You will be the centre of his universe for as long as he lives. You're both lucky!
Thats a good one. 

P.s. the're all good ones.
wholesome <3
Puppies/dogs are a gift that I’m not sure we deserve. But I’m so glad we have them! They’re honestly one of the best things about life.
If you got a baby pittie, you’ve got a best friend for life.
My heart! it can't take the cuteness!!!
The nose boop! 🥰
You two are the cutest!!

this looks just like my childhood dog when i got him as a puppy!
I like how you say “our” friend daww!!

Very non threatening. I like it! As a redditor I bestow upon thee my uptokens

Upvoted because 1. You didn't say "pupper" or "doggo". *Groan* 2. Too cute!
Better Every Loop
I think we have your puppy's brother.  I don't want to overshare but are you in the Austin/San Antonio area?
AAAAAAAA This is so pure and wholesome and I love ittttt
Bro...
It’s so nice to see a fellow poc on the front page. We need more of this. So often we are portrayed in a negative light and berated on this site.
Cool....
Please, PLEASE make sure this dog is properly trained and socialized. Dogs (especially ones from backyard breeders with no knowledge of responsible breeding, and especially pitbulls) can be dog aggressive and people aggressive if they are not properly trained. I implore your friend to do his research about dog training and dog socializing.
Can write me on PM?

Don't kiss your pets on the mouth that's gross. Not surprised though

Edit: so weird I see this comment all the time on Reddit with hundreds of upvotes but when I say it I get downloaded I don't understand bizarro world I think I know why but I just can't say it
