You're my boy Blu 
Hey Blu meet my dog Lou! http://imgur.com/piNbDZ8
Yeah that dogs got people eyes. 
Well that's the most adorable dog I have ever seen.

God damn it Reddit is turning me into an animal lover. 1 year out I never would have thought about adopting a pet, now it's all I think about, and I got Introduced to Reddit about a year ago.

Beautiful dog. My buddy just got a new one too, he's only blue in the face but he's a cutie too:

Keep a close watch on this baby. These blue pitts get stolen way too often. The bad guys sometimes have bad intentions. 
Be honest OP: how many times since getting him have you blurted out "YOU'RE MAH BOY, BLU!!!"?
OK, so look, he's broken - the whole tongue thing isn't normal. I would be willing to take him off your hands and give him a loving home despite him being, as I said, broken. I will be changing his name to Tony 'the Tongue' McGee. Just a favor from one Redditor to another. I may or may not be a saint for helping you like this. If saint is too much, let's just call me a hero for taking this broken pupper. (Damn, he's cute!)
Have you found any blu's clues?
He looks like he is made out of velvet. 
Jus a lil r/blep
That‚Äôs the best grass I‚Äôve ever seen....
This post hit me right in the feels. On Thursday I had to unexpectedly put my girl Athena down. She looked just like this little guy, just older and fatter. She was such a good friend and Im still really depressed. 
Omg this is adorable. You should post this to r/eyebleach.
Both the dog and the grass look straight out of a Pixar movie.
Please don't cut his tail or ears.
One word comes to mind: Musclebiscuit
You stole my dogs name!   They actually look pretty similar :) he had like ice blue eyes for first six months or so
r/blop
Dis boy is DA CUTEST. 12/10 would cuddle fiercely. 
Tonguey taps ftw.
Did you call him that so you could yell "you're my boy blu"?
the dog's tounge sticks out like this because his tongue is too long to fit inside his mouth so he has to leave it out. As he gets older this might change. 
He‚Äôs cute and unsettling at the same time. IÔ∏è feel like staring right into my soul 
I doubt the legitimacy of this dog i need to pet him for verification 
Are you guys doing an ig for him? He‚Äôs adorable. 
Please please please don't crop his ears.
He is the cutest alien ive ever seen üòçüòçüòç
YOURE MY BOY BLU
Ddddawww so cute! If his tongue is like that all the time, might be normal, but best to get checked by a vet. Sometimes they do that when there is something wrong. Apparently there's something called "Hanging Tongue Syndrome"
‚ÄúYou my boy blu‚Äù - Frank The Tank
SO CUTE
Blep
Omg he's blutiful. 
He‚Äôs a wee tank!
He looks like the texture of a well worn and comfy towel!
Omg. LOOKATHIM. I just want to kiss his little nose. üòç
He's Blutiful
My family‚Äôs pug does this all the time. It‚Äôs just as cute when they‚Äôre 9 years old and look geriatric.
This looks like a rendering 
I need some proof that this is a real dog, not a doll
What kind of dog is Blu?

Blep 
Are Blu and Luna the most popular dog names on Reddit?
Is he going to grow into that tongue or will it be like that his whole life?
:P
r/TongueOutHounds!

Come join our new community and share your doggo and their tongue!

Half the blue pits I've ever seen are named Blue...nice choice with Blu!
i suspect you play Team Fortress 2
Oh my god. I want to squeeze him.
So cute
/r/blop 
:p
r/blop
He is the "Captain Carrot" of the pup world. Absolutely good looking and you know he is going to be a strong boy when he grows up. Yet he is the most gentle, intelligent and benevolent person. I like him. 
Haha, my cat also does this when she's [comfortable] (https://imgur.com/JUQ88Za)
inb4 Reddit tells you he has cancer because of this.
His face is giving me such warm, squishy feels. I'm in love. üòç  


Please give your baby lots of snuggles and boops, for me. And kisses. All good puppers deserve such happy, spoiled lives.

His fur is so sleek...<3
Wow a pit named blue, I‚Äôve never heard of that
[removed]
My pit/lab does that every once in a while.  I boop her tongue to remind her it's getting dry.  It's usually when she's sleepy and waking up.
He looks like he's not 100% convinced that you know what you're talking about.
You‚Äôre my boy, BLU!
That is the most beautiful puppy I have ever seen, those eyes...
Cute little guy. 
I‚Äôm looking for a pup like that. 
Wow he's beautiful!  Give him scritches and snuggles for me! 
This is seriously the best quality picture I've seen on this site though. What camera?
[removed]
Ahh, so.That is one good lookin pibble.
What a cute dog 
He has human eyes!
Maybe it's just cuz I'm at a 7 but Blu looks like a very expensive stuffed animal.
That grass looks absolutely amazing. 
Hope you don't have any small kids around. Pibbles love toddlers and not in a good way. 
I think the people at /r/blop would love him.
He's super photogenic
He is so perfect. I want to cry. 
Oh my goodness!!! The goodest of good boys!!!
If Blu asked me to borrow money I would give him everything I had. There would be no saying no to that face. 
What kinda doggo is ol Blu?
Love the tongue!!!!
You came so close to spelling his name right 
Statistically one of the most overall powerful dogs there is, and most likely to cause death to another human compared to other breeds...

but indeed, very cute

Great shot
He's so blue! 
I love him 
Oh my goodness! Your dog is adorable!üôÇ What type of dog is it? 
I wish those eyes could stay blue!
Are his teeth ok? I've known a few dogs that do that with their tongue and it's because their teeth are rotted out. 
Tiny BLEP
My doggo when she was a pup did the same thing. She was the runt and I guess her tongue was just too big it always stuck out. She‚Äôs a giant now. Pit bull / mastiff. 
What an adorable dog :) My dog also sticks out her tongue, those little quirks make them so unique and loveable!
Very cute, My cousin name her new rottie pup Blu too. 
Needs to get on Marnie level!
What kind of camera did you take this pic with?
Super cute.  I like the font on his tag too.  I'm guessing he's named after the bird in Rio?
That's a handsome dog. 
THEY TOOK OUR JOBS!
Should rename him to Blep
Adorable! Got the same name as my girl haha.
Precious 
His name in Animal Tongue is "Great Killer of Bleps"
What a young good boi
Absolutely beautiful pup!
I just wanna poke it back in his mouth. 
Cuuuute!!11!!
Does he have a clue?
Awwwwwww so cuteee üòç
Blu may have an underbite. My pupper's tongue sticks out like that and his underbite is the culprit. 
The blep is real with this good boy. 
Beautiful smoosh face. I know at least 6 people with a dog named Blue. üòÇ

I had a dog named just like that "Blu". He was the runt if the litter he had a blue collar so there name stuck. He ended up growing huge and was the biggest knuckle head ever. He was my favorite dog ever, really was my best friend. Whenever I think about him he still brings a tear to my eye. Miss you Blu Blu rip
Forever blep!

My Grandma and Grandpa‚Äôs old dog was named Blu üò¢
Blu also my dog name. 
Camera so damn good makes him look fake üòÇ.  So adorable though!
Out of curiosity, does he heave all his teeth? I'm only asking because I have 2 chihuahuas that, as they got older, needed all their teeth removed (common dental issues with small breeds) & they don't have teeth to contain their tongues in their mouths. I always say they're "derping," when they're tongues are sticking out.
Blu blu, you good dog you
My old Maltese, Carl, did this. His tongue was too big for his mouth so he didn‚Äôt really have an option. 
That is not a dog. That is a dream come to life. üòç
What kind of dog is this??
What breed is he. 
I literally "awww"ed out loud

Whenever my dogs do this I just HAVE TO touch it. One fingertip. Just gently swiping it from the bottom of the nose to the end of the tongue. I usually only manage one stroke, unless they're sleeping. 
Anyone else notice the little frog on the right, about 2/3 down? :3

You are my boy, Blu!!
I woulda spent it Bleu, like the cheese.

I know its really cute, but an elongated tongue is a genetic defect that can cause serious health problems, including problems eating, drinking, biting the tongue (and resulting infections), and if it's severe enough, breathing problems.

There are exactly 500,185 blades of grass and 5,786,327 hairs on his body....that is the most detailed pupp pic I've ever seen. (No I didn't count)

You should remove the name tag on his collar, could be used to lure him away by a doggy thief!!
Scrappy Doo?
I hope his eyes stay that color! My boy had a pit/ husky mix and his eyes stayed blue his whole life. His name was Blue.
He is adorable but a tongue that hangs out all the time is not a good thing. It may be cute now but it is a sign of something gone awry and can cause cause pain and discomfort as the dog gets older. If other puppies in the litter have the same problem then it could be from irresponsible breeding or it could be a neurological disorder. 
Remind me of this https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zl7PwY7RXMU
He has to grow into his paws and his tongue 
What a sweet boy!!
Does the other name tag say red? 
That‚Äôs not your dog, that‚Äôs the main character in a new Pixar movie.
You know animals like that are teally inbred, that May be the reason his tongue is out all the time
Perfection.
Named after BLU team from Team Fortress 2?
Bet you five dollars he's a good dog too
why not just name him blep then

I named my first dog blue. He was a black lab I had him from 4-26 best friend a kid could ask for. 
what's this good boye's breed?
His fur looks so good
Aaannnddd I'm in love.
r/blep would love this
He looks like a 3D render!
Jesus, what a handsome guy. How can one even be a cat person when faced with this?
You my boy, Blu.
Looks like Scrappy Doo from the live action movie 
He is ridiculously adorable!!
I've found female dogs are MUCH easier to housebreak, but males are a little easier  to teach tricks. Half the time  they teach themselves. About 20 years ago, whenever  I pulled out my rolling papers, he'd go to my "undiscoverable" hiding place and bring me my stash. Then he'd curl up next to me. I've heard a thousand  times that dogs don't  like pot, but Cheyenne  sure did.
This dog isn't real. No way.
what breed is that?
Such a friggin cutie!

This is so real it looks fake.. 
He has the most amazingly human eyes... looks like there's a person in there. 
I'll bet he can find clues!
He's beautiful 
This is the sharpest image there ever was!

Love the derp!!
MLEM ALL THE TINGS!
What breed is this???
Probably slight over bite. My dogs tongue is out all of the time and even more extream.
What dog is this?
Gorgeous! Make sure you get him some training and socialise him early. Wonderful dogs.
Should his name not be "blep" instead?
Gorgeous dog.  Which breed of terrier is he mixed with? 
I feel like I need to boop his nose 
"You're my boy Blu!"
OMG YES.  ANYTHING YOU WANT!  MUST PLAY WITH
Opposed to Red? (I used to be a **huge** TF2 fan.)
Well, you know he's a piddler and slightly derpy, so I'll just have to take him off your hands.  Trust me, it's for the best for all parties involved.
