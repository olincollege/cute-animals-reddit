Good to see Salem working again. I know he fell into hard times with fame and drug use
No tiny hard hat, not OSHA compliant
I love this. Hanging with the shop kitty as I type this! Might get her one too but I will likely bleed trying to get it on her.

Still needs mini steel toe cap boots for each of the 4 paws.
High-viz is short for high visibility, not "high-visual"
_visibility_
Fake.  Where are the other six cats smoking cigarettes watching the work?
"Day 12. This strange tribe of hoomans have accepted me as their supreme leader, and have presented me with clothing befitting my station. All is well. I expect offerings from their food boxes will be forthcoming."
Kitty's missing its safety glasses, tsk tsk.
He is the Site Furman.
Preventing a catastrophe
He was found on the construction site, adopted and given a job.
The man who got the jacket on the cat lost a lot of blood, but is expected to make a full recovery!
Isn‚Äôt it high visibility?
As someone who lives with a similar creature made of negative space, I need to get one of these vests for her too.

She is so hard to see that that it leads to much shenanigans and chaos for all involved.

Don't know what I love more,  that these guys cared enough to protect kitty or that the vest fits perfectly.
If  i don¬¥t recall  wrong , he is a chilean cat. Also he has a identification card with a front pic of his face and  his roll as a worker in the construction  site  like " security staff" or something like that. He achieve more than I  lol
No need for a fall harness.

Looks like my buddy I just lost this week. Made me smile a little bit after a tough week üòå
Did they give it a cigarette and stand around with it for hours
Who said only dogs could have jobs? Probably a dog
This is the kind of wholesome shit a bunch of guys will come up with if you leave them alone for any length of time.
Isn‚Äôt this the kitty that was found on the site and was given the job of foreman?
Imagine how many limbs were lost putting the vest on that cat. . . A moment of silence please.
All you need to do is train the cat to lean against a ahovel

this is so cute......... look at him
And there's a 50/50 chance the cat hates him for it.

The cat is the foreman
Salem?
Alright boys, today we are going to Catnip the water line above bedroom One and Four. Come to meow if you have any questions.
I thought that was two pictures, and spent way too long looking for the invisible high vis cat in the bottom half.

Is it just me thinking r/cuteguyswithcats would appreciate this pic?
This made my day.
Just another body to stare at the 1 guy that's working.



Edit: Sorry, thought it was road construction.

not all heroes wear capes, sometimes, they wear construction vests
And what was the hiring process like? ‚ÄùHow much do you know about construction?‚Äù 

Cat:Meowwwww
That's so cute! I want one for my black cat.
Yes this is what I need
Is anybody wearing a white shirt on that construction site? Tell him to hide or reddit will come for him
wish i could get my cat to wear literally anything.
r/humansbeingbros
High visibility. Not high visual.
Thats adorable
because that‚Äôs what heroes do
my cat would just fall on the side with a vest on
Wondering if they had a cat sized hi vis jacket just in case or if it was made special...it's very cute
Great hazard identification guys! Keep up the good work!
This wouldn't even help my cat who likes to hang out right behind my feet when I'm standing in the kitchen, ready for when I make a backstep towards the fridge.
This is so good on so many levels, not least of which is the workers have safety in mind, even if they are having a small joke around.

There is literally no planned building work in my area and she‚Äôs a mostly indoor cat but I want this for my panther too.
OP, it's called a Hi-Vis, not a high visual.  Lol.

"How do you do, fellow construction workers.  Look at my new high visual!"
It is going to be a little harder to hunt now.
the mailman in my area has his cat with him on his rounds, they live in the area and it'll fuck off and do its thing but it will go back and find it's master on his route and jump on his bicycle.

It's a real treat to meet them and this cat will poke it's head out the front bag and smell you, and he knows me now so he will stay but first months he would just scurrey away:) it's super adorable.

He doesn't have the postal atire though, but that's how I imagine him, in his mailman cap and vest without pants :)
Cat then proceeds to fall over every five feet it travels. At least they will all see it.

cats always have that look on their face like you just asked if they would help you move next weekend..
Not sure why I read the title as "Hugh Jackman jacket" but needless to say i was very confused for a moment
Damn, that construction guy is kinda hot.
Updoot for the site forecat.
I remember this cat from a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/5simgh/this_stray_cat_was_adopted_by_some_chilean/) made two years ago
Genuinely the first time I've heard a high vis jacket being referred to by it's full name.

Highlight vest get that small?
If I wesr one of those, will it protect me from being emotionally hurt?
"Mr. Foreman stuck at the top of the beams again."
Aww. It's nice of them to give hawks/eagles an easier target.
How shall the cat lick itself for cleanliness?
As a thanks you, he taught the construction workers how to cat call
Either that or the health and safety officer is an absolute madlad
This wall needs to hold at least 50 cats, cat bearing wall. Sometimes I feel like that cat is a harder worker than me.
This guy üëèüëèüëè
Clearly that Cat is the boss of the workers
A construction site where you can walk under a latter AND see a black cat? Too much bad luck.
The the car spent the rest of the day trying to kick it off, or at least mine would
Bold assumption he isn‚Äôt just at work
He looks like a good supurrvisor.
It‚Äôs so people can see him better when he crosses their path.
Is that mark ruffalo
Damn cat can survive falling off buildings on 29 floor and still survive with minor injuries.
Stretch n flex MVP
I've never heard it called "high visual" and honestly it never even occurred to me that's what the full name was.
What a good man!
oh no fluffy cat not the cement mixer noooo
Wouldn‚Äôt that just make it easy for him to get stuck in some tight spot when he is off doing cat stuff?
He looks like Trevor from GTA 5
What with the orange vest on the human? We had to replace ours with the new yellow. The cat is ok human isn't.
I think that's the supervisor.
eric roberts loves cats and construction
That man doesn't look like a construction worker
The question is how'd they coaxed the cat into complying with ohs
I‚Äôve never seen it written as ‚Äòhigh-visual‚Äô :‚Äô)
"It" ?!?!??!?!

Hope the cat wont walk in the newly casted floor
Black cats r the nicest.
So many cats so few recipes
OSHA Approves
But still working at high elevation without fall arrest or fall restraint?
What? No hard hat?
Also to make sure he doesn‚Äôt walk under any ladders.
Looks like they have a new foreman!
Where do you get one of these?
Safety first!
Yellow People don't need something like that the ray from alone
High visibility but close bud
Tried a safety harness, turns out he didn‚Äôt need it...
I love that the jacket fits the kitty üëçüèº
Where is this? I think I know that guy.
I met a guy who worked at a forest plantation who painted his dogs tail fluorescent yellow so that when he was operating the vehicles he could see his dog running around in front.
Aww that‚Äôs nice

Hola me ayudan
So precious
I swear I recognize that worker, what‚Äôs his name?
Is it bulletproof though?
Cute and a good idea
I so love this.
Eeee! So so cute and such a wonderful idea. Ideally they'd remove the cat from the work site so it doesn't get hurt or in the way, but I'm not sure what the case is here so I think the vest is perfect for kitty.
Ian mcshane?!?
Shouldn't he be wearing a hard hat too?
OMG SO CUTE
Safety would be happy
Always be safe
Extremely  adorable!
Mark Ruffalo being sweet

So now the cat can get in anywhere?

And that my friends is how you gain a familiar.
Damn, he looks so sharp!
The cat probably had a terrible attitude about it anyway.
Ok I really love this. A lot

"OK, break time's over. Back to work meow!"
The jacket might actually interrupt the cats natural movements which may lead to it getting hurt. Cats are very aware of their surrounding. This is stupid.
Doesn't high-vis mean high visibility?
I think you mean "high-visibility jacket".
The cat is going to just lay down where they are trying to work.
Fits like a glove!
The cat is the foreman. They're building it a giant cat tree.
Muda
Somebody had to take the time to make that fit. That makes me so happy!
All lives matter
TIL the word "High-Visual jacket".
Construction workers are the worst thing that has ever happened to America. We‚Äôd be better off with out them.
