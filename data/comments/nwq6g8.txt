That child is a pixar movie fluffball. Adorable.
My heart cannot take all the cuteness. The girl, the puppy, the fluffy coat thing, I can‚Äôt
THOSE FUCKIN CHEEKS MAN!!!!!! 
My heart!!!!
The best bit is at the end when she says Oopyoopyjupydoo.

I have no idea what that means but I have never agreed with anything so much in my life!
Ice Age Baby
hahahaha, that gibberish in the end, is priceless.
Seems like she did more than try... I'd call that a success.
Where can I get an adult size version of this jacket?
I need this video to be longer. I could watch them all day.
Look at those cheekies! Omg. She‚Äôs like 80% cheek.
I bought tap shoes for my autistic son because he was sneaky and maaaaybe would respond if required? Prolly not tho. 

Tap shoes worked. Although it did sound like semi automatic gunfire when he did the stairs.
Rosy cheeks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
At one point I had three children under four years - I used to put jingle bells on their shoe laces.
The bell thing should be implemented around here.
One of the cutest thing I have seen today.....and can I pull those CHEEKS please!!!!
SHE'S SO CUTE.  LOOK AT THOSE CHUBBER CHEEKS
She is so fucking precious, especially in that puffy fur coat thingy.
I love that all toddlers around the world speak the same gibberish language üíñ
That outfit is fire
Omg those CHEEKS!
Any idea where this place is ?
She's 90% rosy cheeks
Northern? That's not too precise a location...

<*watches video of a traditional, rural culture untouched by the trappings of modern life*>

Ah, of course. Lancashire.
Northern water tribe girl and her polar bear dog
I‚Äòm pretty positive that I just fucking melted
Holy shit her cheeks look like fluffy pancakes I love it
Do I understand her, not one bit. Do I completely agree with what she's saying, absolutely
damn my ovaries just exploded and I'm a man
I live in Michigan. This is what I think UP kids look/dress like.
I love how at the end she tells the camera ‚ÄúBeyoobayoobayoobayoob‚Äù then says ‚Äúhmmm‚Äù as she walks off as if she has left us with something to ponder.
Poopie yoopie doopie yoom!
My parents tied a small around my neck, so they could know when I was coming and could avoid me.
She sounds like Boo from Monsters Inc! Too frickin cute
I like how she's wearing a traditional fur parka but has modern boots on.
ewok
I did something similar with my 3 year old daughter.  She has ‚Äúsqueakers‚Äù in her shoes so every time she steps I can hear her.

It‚Äôs also super annoying.
Those are the CHUBBIEST CHEEEEKS I HAVE SEEEEEEEEN!! I wanna smooosh them
That dog is like..."Yup, just sitting here relaxing. And oop, that's my head all right, buddy...that you keep butting."
Man I don't like kids. But that has got to be the cutest damn thing I've ever seen.
My friend's kid here in the US sounded just like that. Doopadoopadoop! She's six now, they grow up so fast!
We all end up being different by many degrees but we all start out the same, innocent little creatures that just want to love on a puppy dog

babies are universal
Girl: "Meow, meow!"
Dog: "Well... Not completely correct... But very very close! You'll get there, smol one."
No need for bells, the cameraman has her location.
> Northern  

Leeds? Sheffield?
I just love how exited she is about the dog. Like no matter the culture, the relationship between the kid and the dog is always the same.
I think the bells are there to scare away bears.  My dad has friends in Alaska and they would tie bells to their shoe laces when they walked through the woods.  They claim it made the bears stay away.
I want to make this my ring tone!
That dog is so sweet!
Do be do be do be dooooo
Goddamn my ovaries hurt watching this üòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
She looks like Sami people! The indigenous people or northern Scandinavia. They originated from what is now northern Russia near Ural Mountains
This wins the cute and wholesome award for today.
She's like that girl  from Klaus
She has THE cutest chubby cheeks, awww.
I just have this video on loop, listening to her sounds, as I read through the comments. It‚Äôs very soothing.
Those chubby cheeks! üòç
That cheeks
I genuinely wish i could live this, what looks like, simple lifestyle
Belling the kid is a stroke of brilliance. Those little nerds can just suddenly zip away at lightning speed!
Im absolutely in LOVE with that lil girls outfit! Handmade and all natural! Beautiful pelts and an absolutely amazing warm outfit. (LOOK AT THE LITTLE BELLS!!!!)
Doopie doopie do is now my favorite English or non-English sentence
God damn those cheeks. I wanna pinch them.
ice age bebe
The most baby baby that has ever babied
she looks like the ice age baby
Omg, it's a real life precious moments doll.
Famous last words "uh doobeedoobeedoobeedoo". Love it
Baby talk, bdum bdum bdum, same in every culture, angel!
Ooo my god those red chiks
warning, not r/aww but ...

>!The context of this image made me imagine a sort of horror story that involves a kid going missing, a distraught couple or family, and the sound of tiny bells as a horror element. It would be a half subversion to the missing child horror/suspense genre since the setting would be the arctic north during the long winters. If written properly it could incorporate Inuit mythology into the story. Somewhere between The Terror and Hereditary. !<
[deleted]
I've heard that in North America the Native population in the severely cold regions depend on their dogs for their survival. They use sleds to travel to hunt, get other supplies, etc. So, from what I understand, the children are raised around the pups from a very young age to bond and learn how to care for them. Kinda figure it's probably the same wherever this was taken.
LOOK AT THOSE CHEEKS! SO CUTE! This made my day.
Omg this is so adorable, her smile is very contagious ü•∞
Aaahhhh this is so cute!
Didn‚Äôt know they had Ewoks up north
Sweet corn flakes, this is adorable.
Sooooooo cute!!!!! My goodness!

Ice Age baby irl real life
oh my god the cheeks the cheeks the CHEEKS SHEs so CHUBBY AND CUTE
Kids growing up with animals on their side are so lucky. My niece is 3 and my dog is 8 months old now. They are best friends. As a result, my dog has learned to be careful and gentle around kids and my niece has learned to be gentle around animals :) And oh boy the good memories that lie ahead of them <3
my heart just melted while watching this
I like how it says 'tries' to play with a puppy. Because the puppy is not having it.
Her little song at the end is so adorable!
omg, they are so cute together !! ‚ô•
The small bell thing is fucking genius and just realized I need to find this for my toddler.
Send me both puppy AND child and my life will be complete. üòç
That girl is a doll! Her cheeks!!! I want to squish them!!
THEM CHEEKS !!!!!!!!!!
this might be a rlly dumb question but why is the fur on the outside of her clothes? isn‚Äôt the fur side what keeps you warm?
You got to be Inuit to win it.
ICE AGE BABY RETURNS WOOOOOO
OMG SHES ADORABLE AHHHHHHH
Are those cheeks real life? OMG.
What is a "northern girl"? Inuit?
Cheeks about to fall out of hood
Dammit the cuteness overload... anyone here wanna go half on one ?

What an adorable, sweet child.  Love her face, love her outfit.
I wish the video was much longer.
My Alaskan niece has those same chubby cheeks and it‚Äôs making me miss them like crazy!
This probably the purest video I‚Äôve seen possibly in my life?
Yooo those mittens are built into the outfit.

Everything is adorable on this kid.

You can see it with one hand have the mitten and the other is just laying on top of her/his hand.
What a wild planet with so many amazing cultures. Imagine living in a place where children have to be bundled like that.
I used to live in a small mountain town in Colorado. I worked for the vet clinic and we used to tell people not to put bells on their pets as it was like a dinner bell for the coyotes and bobcats.
Great now I want a Disney movie of this girl and her dog. Can‚Äôt stand the cuteness
This hurt my uterus üò≠
I want that coat. 1,85m size.
the bells are there to warn other living beings of this predator... like they do on cats xD
Look at those lil CHEEKS üòäüòç
My gf might be irritated that I said adoopa doopy doopy doom all weekend.
There's nothing more adorable than a baby with big cheeks wearing a hood like this. I could squeal right now!
This kid is adorable
I only had the reindeer fur shoes as a kid, being part s√°mi.
The dog - no leash, no collars, nothing. 
Little girl - better use bells, might lose her.
We bought my toddler squeaky shoes for the same reason.
It's killing me how cute she is. Look at those cheeks!
u/savevideo
Well she is officially the cutest thing I have ever seen
Needs more cowbell‚Ä¶
That's Amazing !
Reminds me of To Your Eternity
There is nothing pure than this moment. When a child and a doggo meet.
That squawk makes me laugh each loop.
So cute!
this is the most wholesome thing I‚Äôve seen
Makes me think of this [Bjork song](https://youtu.be/EcrE2tOCPIk).
The level of adoreableness in this tiny girl and with her hooded fur cloak/dress/robe is off the charts. I want one of my own!!!

The cutest thing I have seen all day. Once you stop hearing any sound though you know your child is doing something they are not supposed to be doing haha
There‚Äôs too much adorableness in this one vid
That bell thing is a smart thing although I don't want to be hearing jingling noises when I take my baby brother to the park while all the kids looking like emperor palpatine
Adorable
cuuuuuuute
Awww what a cute chubby cheek:)
Life must be so different for her (from me), I can't even imagine what their day to day life is like. Posts like these makes me realize how tiny of a bubble I live in, and humbles my opinions.
Cheeks for weeks!!!!
OMG she's so damn adorable! That fur suit is cute as heck.
Ice age baby!
Such s cutie :D
Omg her little face is so sweet ‚ù§
Freaking adorable.
This is the most adorable thing I've seen on Reddit.

I agree with all the commenters who said CHEEKS. Look at 'em! So rosy! Such cheeks!
A real Ewok
Lookit those cheeks üòç

I always wondered why inuit had settled so far north in the cold when there was so much land further south on their migration from Siberia. Anyone have any insight
So cute!
She's so adorable, I could die!
The chubby cheeks, the puppy..my ovaries exploded.
I‚Äôm putting bells in my kids clothes. I don‚Äôt care if they‚Äôre in middle school. It‚Äôs a useful feature.

I want that jacket, it looks so fluffy
cool jacket
I mean, this could be the cutest kid I have ever seen.
Masha and the wolf
Sho be dooby dooby do
She is so cute!!!
I remember when my kids were little it was a common practice to put bells on the baby's shoes, those white high top walking shoes babies used to wear, We would just put them on the shoe laces. It was brilliant until I guess maybe the shoes went out of vogue or maybe the babies figured out how to get the bells in their mouths. I can't remember which. But we always knew where the baby was!
I didn't realise how much I needed this today. Also, when I have kids I now plan on putting a bell on it so I can keep checking that shit!
It‚Äôs do adorable this type of stuff makes me cry omg
When you say northern I was thinking more down the lines of like Glasgow or Edinburgh
Them.  Cheeks.
Ewok lol
This is how babies were ten thousand years ago: cheeky and adorable.
Those cheeks!
I‚Äôm dying... she‚Äôs adorable. And the bells! So smart.
Aww! What a cute dog!
Those half-mittens are clever.
It‚Äôs the ice age baby punt it
Oooh mmmmy god those cheeekeeeeeeekesssss
Just overdosed on adorable
This is the single cutest thing I have ever seen.
Two goofballs
They sound like Boo from Monsters Inc.
Baby language is obviously universal
Omg, she‚Äôs a human baby yoda!
She is too adorable
This is the only kid that I‚Äôve ever thought was actually cute lol most of them I kinda just want to football punt
This child looks astonishingly similar to the animated one from ice age üò≠
It‚Äôs the cheeks!
I‚Äôve always wondered if the chibberish toddlers speak actually means anything to them or if it‚Äôs just fun little noises to express themselves. I guarantee I talked gibberish as a wee lad but it‚Äôd be nice to know what was going on in my head at the time. Also, as an add on, if I had a fluffy coat like this I‚Äôd probably live in it my entire life.
how do I download this? My mother neeeeds it.
Steal this look!
This is super adorable
Why did it sound like he said meow to the puppy in the beginning? XD
cute!
To Your Eternity live action is looking great
Adorable is an understatement! What culture does this girl come from?

Seal skin coat, how sweet. When I was a kid you saw seal skin boots,  gloves coats. Its not a thing anymore, and rightly so, but that coat will keep many little girls warm. I wonder if it has a heavy flannel lining.
God what an adorable child! Those cheeks!!!

This is just too cute for words. I mean seriously this little girl is just adorable! The puppy too.

I didn't want to say this, but this reminds me off  "To your Eternity" Anime.
Your daughter rang.

He doesn't want to play because the kid is wearing his parents skin

No, my parents like cats

Am i the only one who thought ice age baby when I saw the child
I hope the Kiffness remixes this!
I asked that little girl if she wanted to play with my puppy, and she said "I'll be there with bells on!".
Reminds me of IKEA Monkey
It's the baby from Ice Age but all grown up
Half expected her to start smacking it like little kids always seem to do.
