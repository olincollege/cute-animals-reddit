Wait - where did you plant the tree? Does your wife still live in the same house she lived in in college?
I hope you don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm hijacking your thread but it reminded me of something I haven‚Äôt thought of in many years. After a couple of months of dating my husband, of blessed memory, And I was shopping at a leather store. I tried on a winter coat although it was summer at that time. He said he loved it and I said will you be around in the winter to see me wearing it? And he said which year? It was the sweetest thing ever

I like how he eats with his eyes.
So where is the tree? 
[deleted]
This is next level karma farming 
Good thing it wasn‚Äôt a lemon tree. I heard there are  thieves..
I hope this is the part where everyone notices OP only had two comments in the past week for the entirety of his reddit account and calls him out for being a fake af karma farma but I'm an idealist.  
  
EDIT:  Aaaand here's the part where my inbox got hit with other another week-old bot account calling me a dumb tween who wouldn't be on the Internet without my mum and dad paying for it.  =)  Can't fight the dismal tide, folks.
Then the peach tree clapped 
Good job including the tree in the photo, it really adds to the story.
Im just sad that my one downvote isnt powerful enough
It‚Äôs brings tears to my eyes when redditors are finally getting smart enough to call out these obvious sentimental karma posts 
You should show a picture of the tree too if you want me to believe this story.
Why does OP never answer anyone on where he planted the tree while his wife was in college?? So annoying
Does anyone actually believe this nonsense?
And the name of the son: Albert Einstein 
Lies
You live in the same place you did in college?
That tree's name? Albert Einstein. 
I don‚Äôt see him eating anything 
You can really just post any old bullshit with a sob story and dumb people will upvote it.

Then you turn around and use that same account to spam all of us! It's the fucking reddit circle of life!
I planted a weed plant in my girlfriends backyard but we broke up before I could harvest it and she smoked the whole thing.
While it's a nice story, the tree is not pictured and this is a low effort photo. Downvoted. 
God, that is such a creepy fucking thing to say and do. Especially considering this is supposedly the first time you are visiting her. 
Did you move the tree when you moved? 
Every girl I've ever dated would have dumped me on the spot if I did that.
This could be a Nicholas Sparks story. 
This is so fake. Why crop half the peach out of the pic? Why not show the tree? Who says that line?

Fake and gay man.

I did something similar years back for my wife (then GF). I planted a small oak tree in a pot and made a wooden rope swing for her. I told her the tree would symbolize the growth of our relationship and we would be able to plant it in our yard and tie the swing on there one day. She didn't water it and it died 2 weeks later and her mom threw it out.. Im still salty
I downvote pictures of Redditor children that I don‚Äôt know or care about 100% of the time. Take this shit to FB bro.

How many trees did you give before?
Sweet story, but where's the tree?
one of the migrant workers on my familys farm planted a peach tree once...right in the middle of a cow manure patch...it had made everyone who ever tasted a peach from that tree incredibly ill
https://www.reddit.com/r/no_sob_story/comments/9gg8er/child/
I doubt this is real
It's like this dude has watched too many romcoms or something. Like big fish or the notebook. You bought a peach tree for your gf the first time you visited her? How old were you? Must have been fucking young. Also must have  built a house in the same place or never moved or something?  Also posting your child for upvotes on reddit is just weird to me.  I'm super skeptical about even putting my own face on the internet at all. This just smells like bullshit and if it's not than fuck off with posting your kids all over it,  wtf man,  respect yourself a bit.  This shit is gross. I'd be super pissed off if my parents had done this kind of bullshit.  So if it's real or not it's still just awful. Fuck off with this shit.

Fucking pedos.
We bought 2 bare root apple trees and tied them together during our wedding ceremony, planning to graft them together. They died. So we bought a slightly older, bigger (ie not a stick) bare root apple tree that was already grafted and planted it when we moved into our house. 


My husband picked some of the apples this week. They weren‚Äôt very sweet...but it is cool to have a fruit tree with a meaningful personal history bear fruit.
gay
But.... I thought peaches came from a can
I am disappointed cause there is no tree, surely op will post a pic of said tree.
Do you have any other previously planted trees whose fruits other children (not yours, presumably) may be eating somewhere? :-P
Naked peaches are best peaches!

(Well, okay, fresh, ripe peaches straight from the tree are best peaches, but it doesn't hurt.)

You can buy a grafted peach tree in a ~70lb pot of dirt for about $150 at a nursery, which will yield fruit in 6 months if you get it in early spring.

For $200 you can get 3 or 4 different fruits on the same tree. This is because the trunk of the peach tree isn't a peach tree. They graft branches from mature 10-20 year old fruit trees onto the trunks of a fast growing non-fruit tree.

Tree's don't care who's limb is put on them, as long as the sappiness and pH is reasonable. They'll quickly heal. They don't have antibodies that reject transplants.

If you want to grow a "real" peach tree, you'd have to plant it in the ground and wait 15 years, but nobody does that, it doesn't get you anything but a waste of time. Potted graft fruit trees are great, but if you get multiple fruits be aware that as branches die and regrow you might lose certain fruits and be stuck with the winners.

This is a bad picture of a child near a plant.

Orchardomancy is powerful, but unethical. And dangerous

Should that tree ever be chopped down, your life will fall apart.
Cool story. Though, peaches come from a can...
What kind of climate do you have to live in for a peach tree?
we got rid of our peach trees- after four years, they had so many peaches one season that the limbs all started bending and ultimately breaking. then they got blight.  Ultimately- they were not worth the trouble. the peaches tasted good...but they were small, and birds, squirrels, deer, and other peach eating organisms got the bulk of them.

How many threes did you have to plant to get to this point ?
When I was born my Aunty planted a gum tree and named it after me.  John was a sickly tree and struggled to survive in the sandy beachside soil but after thirty years John finally was strong and stretched into the sky.

And into the powerlines. One day the council came and chopped him down despite the protests of my Aunty.  Rest In Peace buddy.
This melted. MY heart

I remember my friend‚Äôs dad planting an apple tree in their yard when we were kids. It took a real long time to grow - and we‚Äôd joke about how there would never be any proper apples on it, because the tree was just a tiny runt. The dad died last year and when I went to pay my respects to the widow, I saw that the tree was a full grown tree now. Almost burst into tears right then and there.
Thats incredibly awesome!

You lucky man, congratulation!
When I visited my now wife in college I said, "You roommate is hot. How drunk do I have to get you to bang her?"  I ate a couple of peaches that night, the hopeless romantic that I am.

Hmm, just tried that on a random woman down the street. So far it‚Äôs not working. Wish me luck. 
Very cool! I planted a crape myrtle about 8 years ago at girlfriend‚Äôs house. We‚Äôre now married and it bloomed for the first time ever last year. 

For the record the crape was planted just above it‚Äôs USDA hardiness zone and it acts a perennial. I thought I protected it enough, but it rarely sprouts new growth off old wood. 
lol that sounds gay
Well done!  Did you plant the tree somewhere that would be permanently accessible, or do you still live where you lived back then?
I'm happy for you guys, op.

A lot of people think marriage is this easy, fairytale thing with white picket fences and daisies and people blowing sunshine up each other's asses.

It's actually work, sometimes *really* hard work. It can definitely be too much for a lot of people to handle, especially when they start out young.

You have a romantic backstory to your relationship and a beautiful son.

May your lives continue to be as fruitful as your lemon tree.

The wife and I bought a house when we were just "the girlfriend and I." In the backyard there was a peach tree, a nearly dead pear tree, and an apple tree.

The peach tree got borers last year in the trunk and we had to take it down, but one of the roots shot up and now we've got a second peach tree that I've become super protective over.

The pear tree was terribly old, not producing fruit anymore. 95% dead so we took it down too. 

The apple tree grew beyond our ability to maintain it so last year we cut back the apple tree. It was oin the rebound so only produced one apple this year which we just picked and ate today.

Last year a new tree appeared and at first I thought it was an apple tree, but this year it reached (early) maturity and we discovered it was a cherry tree, growing up from a root from our neighbour's house. Got our first 3 cherries in the backyard!

... can't wait to get pregnant... :)

That would have been a depressing as shit tree if you two didn't work out. 
My father in law planted a seed the day each of our kids were born. On their first birthday we planted it during their party. All 4 trees were planted in a row together. Each year we'd take a photo with the kids and their trees growing as they did. We just sold that house. I hope they don't cut the trees down at any point. We joked with the kids that on their 18th we'll have to sneak into the property to take a photo.
Sweet story. Your boy looks really exited for that peach.
Awww He's a cutie
This seemingly sweet story has become so controversial that I expect DJT to pipe-in with a "FAKE NEWS--NO COLLUSION!" post at any moment.
Huh? Peaches don't from trees. 

Peaches come from a can.
They were put there by a man.
