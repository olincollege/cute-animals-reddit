LADY OVERBOARD
I love that look she gives right before she falls over the side like “HALP HALP”.... oh I’m fine
That last look before she fell over the edge was one of "If this is how I go, just know I always loved you!"
I had to double check the community I was looking at, I thought it was going to be a snake and end really badly. Pleasantly surprised.
My dog hooped the handle of the sprayer in her collar when I was filling the pool up, got spooked and ran away as she hosed my dad and I down with the sprayer.
Should not drink and dive
HELP I'VE BEEN BETRAYED
I’ve watched this at least ten times and still laughing
That flail though.
It’s beautiful, I’ve looked at this for five hours now
Cue “My bark will go on” music from the Dogtanic....

Edit:
Thank you for the award! ❤️
That last look, she gave up and accepted her fate
Awww poor baby!!
Please hold the line while I send this to everyone I ever met!
She falls so slowly!
I love that this is slow motion but IRL.
"ahoy, good boy overboard! Stop the ship!!"
Go home dog, you're drunk.
My God that comically slow fall . Dogs are too pure!
Reminds me of my old girl, she used to do the same thing... But without the mishap:) 🐾🐾I miss her.
Be it people or animals, the slower they fall, the funnier it is.
Still some impressive doggy paddling.
That is one dramatic plot twist right there.
That’s funny
Lol, so cute
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
it's the August long weekend and everybody and their dog are drinking
I wish I could gracefully fall like that
Oh goodness this dog Sure will make your day for real. Could watch this video many times. Is that good to watch him Or her just makes you 🤣🤣🤣
If she starts coughing and having trouble breathing in the next day or so, take her to the vet! She could have aspiration pneumonia.
What a goof
I meant to do that! 😮😯😲😳
Move along - nothing to see here!
Fly you fools!
Same thing happens to me when I try to pick up the tequila bottle.
Down I go
Father nooooo
r/peoplefuckingdying
To me "terribly wrong" means the dog drowned. :(
Drunk. See how she's slurring her words?
Me after the boys do the shitty beer thing with a pipe
It has all the makings of a horror story
I think the best part is that the dog is somehow able to nearly completely escape the picture. Definitely adds to the comic effect.
still so cuuuuute
She probably did it again five minutes later.  Luvable little derp
Ahahahahahahhha omg
Is she okay?! 😆 😂 🤣 😆
Lol, funny pup.
Oh the humanity!
You can see it on her face lmao “oh no what have I done..whoops”
Then, everything changed when the water attacked.
Abandon Ship!
I was upset and this cheered me up :)
Just having a good time, then someone comes along and pulls the pool out from under you! ... That’s just plain wrong! DUH 😬
Lol such a dramatically slow fall.
Pretty cute
u/vredditshare
I have so had days like that. JS
Thank you. I laughed out loud at this beautiful, joyous dog.
What a derpy cutie! 💘😙
I’ve had a horrible past few days and this gave me a great laugh
r/abruptchaos
I have that pool. It's made for dogs, but it's the best most durable kiddie pool I've owned.
"AVENGE ME!!!"
She got drunk from that beer nozzle
Dog waterboards self and falls out of pool. Pretty accurate.
It took me an embarrassingly high number of loops before I realized it was a hose.
Doggo drunk on water
What a goofball!  Too cute
Silly cutie
I just love how dogs tend to straight face those kinds of falls hahaha. Like “Ah fuck I fucked up yep here we go.”
I had the same doggo for 11 years. A boy tho. I miss the heck out of him.
She’s so floppy about the way she falls, just “oh bye”
No one going to mention the thunderstorm in the distance? Get that dog inside!
I thought the dog was fighting a snake
I can't help but imagining doggo thinking to themselves; "oh. Wonder where I'm going now."  

No panic, no stumble, just *doink, flop.*
Sooo good
I love how she looked happy even while falling over real slow
My wife finishing off a box of wine
he's drunk
Don't mean to be a downer on this cute video, but please take her to the vet to ensure she didn't get water in her lungs from the hose. I've had a bad experience.

/r/WhatsWrongWithYourDog
*OH NO!*
I thought she was playing with a danger noodle and then it was going to bite her but this is surprisingly pleasant
WOOHOO! That was a strong drink! Give me another!!
OH H E M K
Ballast tank full!
Lol
r/HydroHomies
Gorgeous wee doggo!
It all changed when the Water Tribes attacked
I would BOOO either of my beasts for this poor showing. Regardless, awesome and cute.
Reminds me of that one news anchor who fell down comedically slowly.
Hahaha!
*Insert the sound of Mario entering a painting from Mario 64*
Ah, the proverbial drinking from the fire hose. Never turns out good.
The darkness.    It consumes me.
She so much cooler than Peggy hill.
Ah the North American Derphound.  Great breed, that one.
That was such a slow, hilarious fall!
"I accept my fate"
I hope she survived
r/bettereveryloop
Nice
She really water boarded her self if you think about it
Thats what happens when you drink to much...
Is that doggie’s name Jettison?
Dogs are the best!
We have a dogger down
when cuteness hits hard
I thought her nail was gonna tear the bottom of the pool or something. This is much better
Now i wan a dog
You can tell she fully experienced that fall. 
Look how slow she went.
WHARRGARBL
It looked like she got drunk and passed out... from water.
I want an edit where it pauses as she falls down and plays the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme as it slowly zooms in on her face
That last second! Haha!

AVENGE MEEEEE!
Lol oh my gosh...how dramatic and so.cute!
Near...far....
Can't stop laughing
I have fallen and I can’t get up
Drunk again!
your pooch has to lay of the fucking drugs, they are turning his mind into mush!
r/holdmykibble
Omg i thought it was a snake at first.
took too much , toomuch
This dog falls like Shaq
Brain freeze? Haha
Awww
what a horrible fall
Mean Mr Gravity 😡
Oh no, so terrible
I thought the dog was playing with a snake at first
What happened to the dog?
Ope.
I want a dog like her. ❤️
Yea , it's a behelit
r/peoplefuckingdying
r/animalsbeingderps Such a cute, derpy girl. Lol.
aWw
Hey them awards belong to the original post :(
I've drunkenly fallen over in a similar slow and accepted fate approach.
It gets better the more times I watch
You made my day, that was adorable
😂
This is actually very dangerous. A pediatrician in our family had a child patient pass away from drowning through a hose.
Plop
When Minecraft doesn’t get a cave update
She is so adorable and her fall looks slow motion. Cute!
/r/YesyesyesNo
Hahaha sweetie pie!
Poor baby D:
This is too fucking adorable.
Dry drowning
Magikarp used Splash! ... Nothing happened
Thanks. Needed the smile today.🙂
My dog did this exact thing
I just totally laughed out loud !  This is so cute and its like she falls out on the grass in slow motion.
omg ahahha
oh no, I hope she has recovered.
He fell too cute!
*SCAR, BROTHER*
I thought it was an eel, I had to look twice. I think I had a heart attack
She Hans Gruber’ed outta that pool.
r/MisleadingCaptions
i like how the repost got so many more likes than the original post.
Please be careful, dogs can die from ingesting  too much water like that.  It happened to my sister in law’s dog and it was devastating.
I feel that
TBH the Labrador would have drowned if it hadn't fallen over and dropped the hose.
How is there not r/dogsdyinginside? And how is this not posted on that nonexistent sub?
Oh that was good
Every other holdmycosmo post....
labs are the best
This is me(American) managing my Covid emotions. Please pat this dog, if it's yours, as I can relate.
This is 2020 in gif form
So graceful lol
@weratedogs
Is she dead?
What a cute doggo I hope he wasn’t hurt by that nasty fall 😬
IS there a subreddit for slow controlled falls? Like people/animals accepting their fate and slowly toppling over?
｡ﾟ(ﾟ^∀^ﾟ)ﾟ｡ｷﾞｬﾊﾊ!
I thought the pool would fall over!
I saw this on We Rate Dogs. Hilarious!
Things went terribly RIGHT! :D
I found my new spirit animal
Hahahahha what a derp!!! Love these videos...
She just accepted it lol
That went awesomely right you mean
Hahahahha floof oops
good boy!
u/vredditshare
Cute and clumsy, I love it!
Classic puppy move dude.
She has to sit out for 30 minutes anyways because of lightening. She’s just a good obedient girl.
Have watched this at least nine times already

The look on her face as she goes over
Kiras theme would go greatly with this
The face makes me think of that scene from the lion king
God shes fucking dead
Is that water or alcohol?
What's it
*Forces pullin' from the center of the Earth again...*
Yep, that's a Labrador alright.

The Goof is strong with this one.
Wasn’t this from the Dodo Twitter?
Pupper.exe has shutdown
To add insult to injury, at the end you can kinda see she struggles outside the pool to get back on all fours.
The sicko’s filled the pool up with vodka.
OMG this is too funny!!
OMG
At first I thought she was playing with a snake.
She tried to water oats herself first.
LABRADOWS ARE THE BEST DOWGS
Oh god I hope she's okay!
I love this dog she is so cute and funny ❤️
Cuteness overload 🤩🤩
Cute!
Funny
u/gifreversingbot
Oh heck!
Just, where can I get puppy pool that big?
Ohhh nooo 😊
Hahaha she falls like middle aged women do!! They just kind of fall in slow motion and you see at some point they just accept that they're going to fall.
Oh my god, she’s dead!

The Dog passed out when the hose filled her lungs with water and she began to drown.
I sent this to my gf and said "this is the most Bailey thing ever" because she spoke to doing dumb things on a daily basis.
Video was cute but letting your dog drink straight from the hose like that is actually dangerous for her.

Please don't let your dog do that.
