Cat: listen to my bullshit 
But myyyyaaaaaaammmmm
Whats it doing??! They hates us, they wants us to starve, precious. Filthy, nasty humansess haven't fed us in hours, ***hourrsssssssssss, precious!***
"Now listen here you little shit" - Peach
I just text my wife when I feed the cat so she knows Thumper is full of lies. Sometimes she gets ready for work in such a sleepy haze that she zombie mode feeds Thumper anyway, so maybe a big ass sign would help.
Just sent this to everybody ever. I'm now basically a hero 
"Let me sing you the song of my people"
That's not nice

Board is a lie

It make me sad

It make me cry

I am starving 

Am almost dead

Three whole minutes

Since I last fed
Why are house cats always so hungry? Do they act starved out of boredom?  

My sisters cat is huge & he meows pitifully to every new person that enters the room to feed him AGAIN.
mfw im back on my bullshit
I could never in a million years keep a cactus around my dumbass cats. I can just imagine how much money those fuckers would cost me in vet bills. 
My cat is also named Peach! Because she is a plump and fuzzy little happy peach :) yours looks like she is too!

That's fucking hilarious. Even more funny because he can't read.
I absolutely adore naming animals after food. My dream is to get two cats and name one waffle and the other pancake.
That cat looks like it sat on the cactus
Peaches going viral once again. Good to see! And the sign probably took a lot less time than the castle. 
We had a good feeding regime down. Shamal knew when food was coming and never woke us at night...then we had a baby. The increased need to be in constant competition for attention, plus mom and dad waking up at odd hrs meant he started to be REALLY beggy. Yes we are awake at 3am. NO it does not mean it's dinner time. If you wake us up at 5 begging you are gonna be sorry. 

So we did the most logical thing. We outsourced the act of feeding. Got ourselves an auto feeder and things have been great ever since. Don't look at me mate! It's outta my hands, talk to the machine. 
We had to do this with our pug. Even though we made it 1 persons job to feed him, he figured out he could do his excited-hungry dance and convince others he had not eaten even when he had. OP has a bad solution because if someone forgets to change the sign after 12 hours, the cats can miss their next meal because the sign still says they ate. Our solution was a folded paper on the food bin. A sun on one side and moon on the other. If you feed the pug breakfast, flip the sign to the sun. Everyone walking past can now see he has already eaten no matter how believable his dance. If you get home from work and the sign is still the sun, you know he hasn't eaten dinner, feed him and flip the sign to the moon. Now anyone can feed him and everyone in the house knows if he has or not.
"Peach Hungry!"
He just booped that cactus and is still feeling the repercussions of such a decision.
"Please Sir, can I have some more?"
His Instagram is @princepeachblossom if you want more close ups of the floof and the chub 
Did anyone else think the cactus was flippin the bird in the thumbnail?  
[Thirty seconds after you've left the house](https://i.imgur.com/9iztiHj.png).
Mowwwwwwwww! I‚Äôm hungry!
That's really nice typesetting. The alignment on the smaller text is legit!
That's cactus looks like it had an idea
I need to know where you got that board and letters. If you could get back to me it would be much appreciated.
I know Kmart home decor when I see it. 
I never understood this breed of cat. Weird and ugly. Like a cat pug. 
If cats could talk, they'd lie.
"But myyaammm " I'm hungry!

true story.
"Feed me meeeeoooooowwwww"
Ah the ever coveted Pinterest board yippie :)
Signed, the other kat. NB: feed the other kat. 
CATTICA! CATTICA!
Probably a hipster
That‚Äôs a great cactus you‚Äôve got there. I‚Äôve got cat and cactus envy.
Peach is cringing at the lack of punctuation.
Why that cat look like Wilford Brimley tho
nya cat the best xD
 this is literally our life every 8 damn hours.  

And then she tries to kill us
Relatable 
I have a cat named Peach too. Can confirm bullshit.
This happens with my cousin‚Äôs cats.

I‚Äôve been staying with my cousin for a while, and when I‚Äôm alone with the cats they start to follow me everywhere and meow constantly until I follow them to their food bowls. Her husband told me he feeds them, but I already knew what the cats were doing because my dogs did the same thing back in the day.

I even had a guinea pig that would do that to me. She‚Äôd wheek loudly at 3 am and I‚Äôd walk over to her cage to see what was up, just to see her staring at me next her food bowl with a little food left in it. She knew I would come, and that‚Äôs why she did it. It worked the first few times she did it, after that I was like, ‚ÄúNo, pig. It‚Äôs 3 am, and you still have food. See you in a few hours.‚Äù
The dog.  It was totally the dog.
Haha! This happens in my house too those manipulative jerks try to get second breakfast or second dinner all the time 
Cactus is givin the finger
When my daughter was about 5, we were all in the kitchen and cat was meowing for food and getting between our legs and feet and generally annoying us. She thought she'd use a line obviously picked up from me at some point and blurted out "Fucking cat!" Obviously, as responsible parents, we burst out laughing.
Really? I can make a sign then put s cat in front of it an get front page?


On second thought fukn right 
Man, what a roller coaster of double-takes.

A few weeks back, I woke up to a note on the fridge saying this exact same thing. Now I know, if you have a message, use message-board.
Whatever that cat is doing in this picture it‚Äôs actually the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen. Fuckin hilarious 
That fucking pained expression 
What kind of cat is this, these smash faced cats always bother me
"But *moooomm*"
Looks like a jazz or blues singer
where did u get that cactus planter
That cat looks like it's singing the power ballad of bullshit.

And IeeeIeeeI'm soooooo hungreeeeeeeeeeeeeey
Am I the only one that sees the cactus giving us all the finger, obviously in support of the cat?
ULPT: Buy this sign once, and you don't have to buy cat food any more
Lmfao!!!
I'm sure it's too late, but I photoshopped a 1920x1080 wallpaper of this I love it so much.

The cry for hunger 
Poor inbred thing. It's flat face is obviously the result of inbreeding. Probably has eye and breathing issues and cost 10 times more than a normal healthy cat. 
We always say: ‚ÄúThe dogs have been fed. DON‚ÄôT LET THEM TRICK YOU!‚Äù
'But... Hungry!'
This is awesome, cute kitty.
I need to get this sign and put it on my neighbor‚Äôs porch.
Obviously it‚Äôs been me.
The dog.
He looks exactly like my cat to the point that I started having a panic attack that someone stole him.
Sooo my cat

Yeah, I'm saving this one.
Actually most of the time they just want attention, not necessarily food.
Got a cat from the shelter once, belonged to an old lady before. Was very much overweight because the old lady just gave her food when she meowed. And she meowed a lot. But if you gave her cluddles she was just fine.
"ngeehh~"
Give the poor baby some more food, he‚Äôs obviously stAaaaaarViNggggGg

That‚Äôs fucking adorbs 
Is that cactus pot melting? 
I can hear Peach complain.
dat face though
Ben the cactus seems to be giving the middle finger...to the cats or the sign, hard to say
[deleted]
But where do I get this cactus??
I relate to this on a spiritual level.  
BUT MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!
I‚Äôm sorry, the person who wrote the sign is in another castle.
Reee
I always say "Don't believe their lies" to the wife when we get in after picking her up from work. The cats are devious. 
*DON‚ÄôT
This picture made laugh so hard I cried. WHY 
Evil
Miss me with that bullshit.
Must be nice to be able to have plants without your cat killing them. All 7 of them that you‚Äôve bought. After you just bought a brand new pot. And new soil. 

Not a personal thing though. 
LOL!
We have a Peach too!! 
That cat has an interesting pose.
Tricksy Hobbitses
Is Peach the one of the left or right?
Holy shit! Does anyone know where I can get one of those cacti? I‚Äôve been searching for a (relatively cheap) desk side saguaro for months now!
Cat's can also be picky if you've bought them higher quality cat food or tuna.
It looks like the cactus is owning up to writing the sign. ‚ÄöTwas I‚Äò.
Peach: unglued me from this spot you selfish prick
cool cate
It looks like the cactus is flipping Peach off, dealing the final blow.
For years my dad would feed our cat before going to work. Then my mum would get up and Smudge would be rubbing her legs and meowing so my mum would think he hadn't had his breakfast. So she'd feed him too. No wonder he was the size of a small terrier.
Yaaaaaaaas love Peach!!!! 
This made me laugh so much! When my man heads out ahead of me he leaves a note saying  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fed Ruby. Ruby lies‚Äù
True
This is utter replica of goverment saying.
We are doing best to you,don't protest infront of townhall ü§£
Anybody able to identify the cactus type?
r/DumbCat
It's a good idea assuming you flip it over when they haven't been fed.
I wonder what the other side would say?
"But muuuuum"
classic Peach
Middle Finger Cactus üëåüëå
Meh meh mehhh meh meh meh mehow
My cat begs both me & my bf for food every morning trying to trick us both into feeding her. She occasionally gets fed twice when we're both tired & miscommunicate. She struts around like a winner for the day. But she maintains a healthy weight thankfully. 
I bet the cactus is on the ground just to screw with the cats.
I have basically stopped eating tuna myself because of the pain in the ass the cats are when I open the can
Ken leeeeee. Oh libo dibo dow choooo-oooo.
Ken leeee, Ken leee any more
Did you feed it a babyruth??
the cat is upset, why do you upset your cat?
Peach... Put the NT from don't over to have. You can pay me in hugs later. 
How many times is it ok to feed a cat?
Like, does it matter or what matters are the grams?
My cat Marissa is very affectionate... so she would trick me into thinking she's hungry... my grandma would end up feeding her when she got up and I would feed her like 10 hours later...
WEH!
When I lived with my mom we would write on post it‚Äôs who got fed and when...she worked third and I worked first, so I would feed the 4 cats and 2 dogs, go to work, an hour later she‚Äôd come home and feed them again cuz ‚Äúthey seemed so hungry‚Äù. 
Looks like the cactus showin middle finger !
Now listen here meow...
What breed's the cat on the right?
the cat can read the sign
This made me laugh out loud while brushing my teeth! Bravo! 
Holy crap, Gandalf is Peach's twin! https://imgur.com/a/M6fsI
Only problem is that people will listen to their bullshit regardless of the warning. 
Lovely Cat!
I work thirds and always feed our cat Nebula when I get home. I have told my wife not to fall her ruse again. 
If you are reading this Nebula, you aren't as smart as you think you are! 
Almost a Memento quote
good looking cat!
That face looks like it belongs on r/sadcats

Ok I‚Äôm not one really for pet pictures, but this captures something special in its humor. Genuinely made me chuckle. Thanks. 
mowwww
Cat.
I need that sign for my kitten! 
This is number one bullshet
I saw a chick use this picture on tinder a few hours ago. That's where I first saw this. Not sure what's going on... 
Is the wording on the sign a reference to ‚ÄúMemento‚Äù?
Another cat named Peach! Awesome!

His face is identical to the E.T honey bun.
Funny
Cat: But the bowl is empty!
Shsh
Since human put those light things on that dark thing I've stopped being fed by everyone else. Not happy. Might try weeing on the dark thing, see if that sorts it out.
Lmao.  That‚Äôs almost the same as I told my daughter the other night. 
I want a smoosh-faced kitty for my next kitty.   They are always super cute.
I thought they only bred Persians with those horrible, smushed-in faces.
Saw this as my cat was screaming for more food after I fed her 10 minutes ago
**Linda! Listen, listen!**
Peach probably has a pretty good idea who is responsible.
We have a cat with diabetes so feeding time is regimented. It doesn't stop him though from begging whenever one of us comes home. The drama cat tries to play every angle.
I also have a kitty named peach who is a big whiner!
What breed of cat is this?
Reminds me of my friend saying, "The dog lies!"
That Cactus is being offensive
This is a brilliant idea.
I have a whiteboard like this for my dog. Weasal pup was getting twice his normal amount of food. 
Check the water content of your catfood. 
Do you know where can I buy one of this sign?
You‚Äôre a monster 
This cat looks like Garfield. 
My family of 6 needs this. Combined with 
4 kids and a dog who‚Äôs an asshole, he can get fed up to three times a night.
Could also just want some attention or playtime :/ 

I NEED this sign, my kitties are deviant like that too. 
Is that cat doing an awoo?
My cat does this. Then I check its food dish and it's full.

It wants fresh food, it just doesn't want to *eat* fresh food.
Is this one of those Make America Great Again cats?
This breed of cats remind me of Mogwai. Don‚Äôt know why I never linked them together but it just hit me. 
 r/PhotoshopBattles
My cats name is Peach! 
I need this for my dog. Damn Dachshunds are like goldfish.
What a perfect picture.  And the cactus really ties the room together.
HAIL SATAN

(666th comment) 
My girlfriends cat Batman will wake us up at any hour if he feels as though his food bowl is too low, not empty, just not full enough for him.

On the off chance it was empty, once filled he would gorge himself and vomit. 

We have an automatic feeder now. 


My cat was literally just begging me for a treat (with a full food bowl) as I read this post. You know me well Reddit. 
Btw your a beautiful internet cat and fuck these troll motherfuckers. Keep begging for that food you‚Äôre beautiful. 
Why is the cactus flipping us off?
Now I want to take a Polaroid picture of that cat and write "Don't Believe Its Lies" on the bottom like this was Memento.
More pictures of your cats please <3
peach looks so soft
We use a collar system. Collar on in the morning for morning feeding. Collar off at night for night feeding
Peach forgot how to cat üê± 
wouldn't it be catshit???
If you put the cactus behind the cat, it will make her face expression legit.
A young Wilford Brimley wanting more sweets.
Peach is just annoyed about the missing apostrophe.
That is why cats are always fat
 even the cactus looks like its flipping you off.
My cat just eats my dog‚Äôs food. Problem solved...
I had a neighbour that let their cat scream all day for no reason. Very annoying, makes you feel like there's always a stray on heat just outside your window.
Zz  z   .   .   A  .      
When I was a kid we used to leave dry cat food out all day. They ate when they are hungry. Since when do cats over eat?
As a cat owner this is so fucking true
‚Äú but mooooooooom‚Äù
I need this sign in my house!!! 
Perfect photo!
I desperately need that sign
Am I the only one that sees the cactus giving us all the finger, obviously in support of the cat?
I know I‚Äôm late but my car won‚Äôt eat until you put *new food* into his bowl. It‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. He meows with a full bowl of food so you have to pretend to put food in his bowl for him to eat. It‚Äôs infuriating. 
"MASTER!! WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN MEEE!!!"
SOOOO CLOSE TO 100K UPVOTES, MUST SUUUUUUUUUCK
How can anybody buy such an ugly voldemort cat?
Love this, my boyfriend needs a sign like this otherwise my cat can sometimes be fed more often due to his lies! 
Awwwww so cute
Cute sign, but I'm worried that the cat might have breathing problems with such a short snout.
I know your pain and feeling. I can‚Äôt say for sure but I‚Äôm pretty certain none of them are veterinarians or vet techs. At the end of the day all cats are picky or they like shit a certain way. I have 4 myself and only 1 is overweight. Guess what, they all have food everyday in their bowl. They don‚Äôt eat all the damn time and they get wet food everyday. Guess I‚Äôm putting to much food out right? Well Fuck anyone else that sees this comment and doesn‚Äôt like it or has something to say. You don‚Äôt shame someone‚Äôs cat, that‚Äôs like calling their kid ugly or fat. FUCK YOU TROLLERS. Btw your cat is fucking gorgeous. 
Hit it with a rolled up newspaper.
Lol that cat‚Äôs face is perfect
Fake news ! The cat looks so hungry
