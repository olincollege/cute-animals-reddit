There's a turkey that lives in my neighborhood that will stop at crosswalks and wait for cars to pass before crossing the road. He even waits for the walk sign. He's a local legend.

Edit: Just remembered something else. One time, he got confused and walked into the road without waiting for the signal. The cars are used to him walking around there, so three out of the four lanes came to a halt. He got upset, pecked at some of the cars for a while and then finished crossing.
Im guessing Nara, Japan
“That’ll be 100 bells, please”.
That deer is smart.
I can’t believe how many people didn’t let it cross, that’s so rude
Jesus, take your time why don’t you. No wave, not even that little half jog we all do to at least look like we’re trying to hurry across. Does this deer have any clue at all about cross walk etiquette. Ruminants these days, I tell ya.
I love how she took her time to cross slowly like a lady
What a well mannered forest pupper
That crosswalk doe.
You’d think they’d put deer crossings in smaller towns where it would be safer for them to cross. It’s so irresponsible of us to allow these deer crossings to be in areas where these deer are so likely to be struck by oncoming traffic.
That deer has more street sense than most humans.
I like this
Any time I'm driving and see a deer near the road, I'm just like, 

>don't you fucking do it you bastard. don't you do it. don't even think about it bucko.

I like to think that's the only reason I haven't hit a deer yet in TX.
Shoutout to the one single driver who actually stopped for the lil guy

Edit: I’ve been informed it’s a lil *girl
Is this beta gameplay or alpha?
I bet this is in Nara, Japan.
Nintendo's next installment looks dope!
Animal crossing new horizons looks rlly good
Who doesn't stop? Deer go from 0-60 in a couple of seconds...if it ran out any one of those cars would have hit it. Even if you don't care about the deer (if you're an asshat) don't you at least care about the dent you'll get in your car?
Next to where I live a group of ducks cross the street legally everyday twice... and everybody stops to let them pass it's so cute
Wow what a smart deer

Very unlike the stupid fucks we have
Perfect etiquette
That little bow they do is adorable. I really want to visit Nara to see these deer! Also AC:NH, March 20th - let’s gooooo!
You can’t use that title. You have no idea how rabid the r/animalcrossing sub is in anticipation of New Horizon coming out.
Oh deer.
Yeah no rush mate.

The driver probably
It kinda weirds me out that the woodland creature waited until the cars completely stopped and then crossed at the crosswalk...like a person.
I was getting pissed  that so many people didn’t stop. He was in the crosswalk area
Wow the Nintendo switch has great graphics
They've evolved.
This deer is better at safely crossing s street than many humans.
he do be waiting very patiently tho
Natural selection, only the smart deers survive the threat of streets.
I love how it took it’s fucking time. It waited through so many cars I figured it’d scurry across but I love how it just gingerly strolled
Is anyone else kinda mad it took lole 4 cars for them to stop?
Reminds me of the time I stopped so a fox could cross the road. He looked at me and even used the crosswalk...
Be a lot cuter if people let it cross
I hated it how many people just started to slow down like a lot but still didn't stop. Thanks for the last MVP.
Gotta stop for pedestrians at the crosswalk
u/vredditdownloader
Can someone stop for him?! He’s at the fucking cross walk!
Sure took his deer sweet time..
[kind of relevant,  deer crossing lady.](https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI)
I love that game!
I can't believe how many people were dumb enough to just drive right by it like it isn't an animal that is of a species that almost has an inclination for getting hit by vehicles.
Freakin intelligent
Respect to the man in the silver van. Fuck the rest
He's so patient. I love him.
I will fight every single person who didn't brake for that deer!
Me: Mum, can we get Animal Crossing New Horizons
Mum: no, we have Animal Crossing at home
Animal Crossing at home:
What a bunch of fucking ass holes. Stop so the poor thing can cross. Took her 5 seconds to get out of the way. God damn pricks I swear.
Scale of 1-10 how silly is it that I was sad/mad with all the vehicles that just went through before one stopped for the lil’ guy?
Finally someone stops for the poor deer!! Geesh!
These deer seem to be way smarter than deer in America...
5 people ignored basic driving rules...
What is wrong with all those people who did not stop for the deer?
I guess If it got hit from the traffic going in the other direction it wouldn’t be on r/aww
Stop for the damn deer
oh so now the game's name makes sense
Veryy smarttt
poor jingle no wonder he’s late
That Americsn lady who called into the radio show complaining about the deer not using the crossing is going to love this.
Why didnt the bus stop for her? The fuck? She needed to get to a new town.
Finally, a deer who respects traffic laws!
Reminds me of the lady who was concerned about the placement of deer crossing signs
Jesus Christ even Japanese animals are respectful and bow.
I was getting unreasonably mad at people not stopping
I was getting heated watching all those cars keep going, “let the (expletive) deer go!!” Lol.
That dude/dudette in the Nissan van is a good person, letting the little deer go by.
ANIMAL: BECOME HUMAN
It’s almost like they know.
What you can’t hear is the deer silently muttering asshole every time someone doesn’t stop
odd how many people didnt stop, id stop right away just to see it
In my area it would come flying out of nowhere straight into my windshield
That person deserves to be blessed for eternity.
Why are they not stopping
I find it amazing a fucking deer can use a crosswalk but I see people in my city jaywalking 30 ft from a crosswalk.
Maybe deer in the Midwest could learn a lot from Japanese deer instead of leaping in front of my fucking car
Somebody slap an Animal Crossing theme song over that video, stat!
Well that was more considerate than most human pedestrians where I live...
When it nearly took a step forward while the cars were still moving my heart skipped a beat.
I thought for sure that car at the end was going to smash it
Damn the graphics have gotten way better since I played it on the Wii
Sure, take your time. So glad I let you cross. Fucking pedestrians.
I see deer crossing signs all the time, never see them use it though - all the deer near me are jaywalking jerks.
Even deers in Japan are polite. He even bows.
That deer behaves better in traffic than most humans I know...
Am I the only one who is horrified that it took so long for someone to *stop* 👀😰
Deer in Arkansas: YEET
This HONDA ♥️
I didn’t know Nintendo decided to go with more realistic graphics for New Horizons
Hey, stop already.

Can’t you see I’m a pedeerstrian
I like that it looked both ways
Probably saw his homies die jay walking. So this deer uses the crosswalk now.
No wonder they arent stopping. That's a *zebra* crossing
Okay I got scared at first since I thought it was from r/idiotsincars and thought it was gonna get it, then I see r/aww and I let out a sigh of relief
Everyone that didnt stop is a complete moron and needs to re-take their drivers test. Animals are unpredictable, when they are that close to the road - stop. you'll win maybe 3/10 times. 

Source: Live near the wilderness.
It’s crazy to think that deer were here first. This is their home and we are intruding. We are forcing it to wait and be careful whilst crossing.
Am I tripping or was the same car in that video like 10 times
So now I'm completely convinced North American deer are some of the dumbest. I really wish deer where I live were as smart as in OP's video.

The deer that we have here are practically suicidal.
currently mad at the cars that didn't stop for him/her
It’s on its way to New Horizons.
Fuck cars. No matter how convenient they make human life, they are undoubtedly inconvenient for every other soul on this earth.
Looks like Nara
The deer that respect right of way passed on their genes, so now we have traffic aware deer. 

Evolution!
Wtf?!?! It just *waits*?! These bastards run out in front of cars all the time here. Literally everyone I know that drives has hit multiple deer. I hit one a couple of weeks ago. I have totalled cars because these idiots love headlights. But this one knows how to use a crosswalk? Is this a different breed? Can we get them to mate with the ones where I live?
I imagine they view cars as some sort of large noisy herbivore (since they don’t chase deer) that likes to travel in straight lines, like a kind of weird bison.
Nara Japan?
This is the most respectful animal ever must be a reincarnated monk...
She used the crosswalk! I am so impressed.
Deer where I live will straight up try and jump in front of your car
Nara, Japan, a magical city
He's waiting at the crosswalk you animals!
He knows how to use crosswalk unlike people
What a bunch of assholes.
He just takes his sweet time, doesn't he?
I wish humans were just as smart.
Aww someone finally let the little fellar through.
I can't believe it took that many cars before one stopped to let her across
Wow! I'm surprised at how many vehicles didn't stop.
Lmao dumbass deer. That’s clearly a zebra crossing.
I feel this dude, like come on guys just let me cross man..
I’ll never forget the time I was driving at night and I came right up on a deer that was on the side of the road. I shit you not I saw that fucker look both ways before crossing!
That animal is smarter than some people at crossing the road
Those drivers are jerks! He clearly has the right of way! He’s at a crosswalk for God’s sake!
He bowed his head in thanks.
I love how he patiently waits and then takes fucking all day to cross. What a champ!
I feel like that little bow in the middle is equivalent to when we humans wave thank you to the driver behind us.
That’s the definition of saunter.
Wtf? Who doesn't stop when an animal wants to cross the road, it should not have taken 5 vehicles before someone stopped.
i value that person who stopped for the deer as a human being
New Horizons
Almost a r/SadAww
Most wouldn’t let it cross :/
I was just waiting to see who was going to stop
Love how he walks at the same speed humans do when crossing.
The geese by my work wait for traffic and cross in the crosswalk. The high school students don’t. And this is why animals are better than people
They are.... Evolving
I saw some elk do something similar at the Grand Canyon.. they were using the crosswalk and everything  ..
Fuck all those people who didn’t stop
YOU HAVE TO STOP AT A ZEBRA CROSSING. that's bad
This deer is smarter than some of the pedestrians in Denver...
Thats aww as fuck.

One up to not burning the world of men straight to the ground.
They’re evolving 😮
Why does it take so long for people to stop and let them cross?!
What kind of monster doesn’t stop?!
Just a city boy, trying to cross the street, he waits for the passing cars to stop passingggggg
He was trying to reach some New Horizons


Only 21 more days!
I can’t believe how many people kept going. When there’s a pedestrian at a zebra crossing, YOU STOP FOR THEM!!
I was watching this like: asshole, asshole, asshole, asshole, THERE, finally a decent human being
The graphics are astounding.
Wow the new Bambi movie is looking so real
i was so mad that nobody was stopping
Wow these graphics are pretty good for a Switch game
This deer has Nara a care in the world!
That'll be 50,000 bells.
Shocking that deer get it, but people don’t.
That deer clearly had right of way
No road etiquette these days
This needs to be posted somewhere squirrels can see it.
Why does nearly everyone drive a minivan in Japan?
I’d like to introduce him to American deer. They literally give zero fs. They will jump through the car.
That shows how badly we as humans have wreaked havoc on the natural order of things
It seems sad..
At least 3 of those should of gotten a ticket
Smarter then some humans out there at crosswalks
why wouldn’t they let him go?!
see even the animals are civilized in Japan....
Would it hurt to go a little faster? Come on now!
Clever girl
I love the deers reaction when people aren’t stopping.
That’s awesome. I’ve seen a fox do the same exact same thing at a crosswalk.
That's a deer tho... Who the phak awarded goat blindass
Who the eff are these jerks that don't stop to let a lil guy pass?!
Maybe she's looking for a new leaf
I like that it got tired of waiting and put a foot forward to show it means business. Then the next car finally stopped to let it cross
This is cute, but it actually kinda bums me out that animals have had to adapt to us instead of us adapting to the earth and their environment.
Shame it's not a Zebra.
I am more than a little annoyed by how many people didn’t stop.
I can’t be the only one to notice how 4 cars out of 5 have that heavy square design.
He is standing at a pedestrian crossing, the cars have to stop and he must cross
My best friend was spending the weekend with her cousins who live in a very small town here in Alabama.   They were at church on Sunday and the doors were open because it was a beautiful spring day.  Well, in walked a chicken!  My friend slightly freaked out (we live in a concrete jungle of a city) and the folk at the church were more amazed at her than the chicken.  Everyone got a laugh!
Smarter than most people.
Goodboi
Pedestrians have the right of way! These drivers should be ARRESTED.
This is peak evolution right here
Assholes who didn't stop for the deer. Poor deer, I'd stop for you dude
The folks who slow but don’t stop are the worst. Why bother?
Way too many people kept driving
All the deer in my town like to wait until you’re 10 feet away going 50mph before yeeting into the road
Even gave him a bow at the end...what a legend
That happened to me when I was living in the Northern part of NY.  The doe stopped, looked both ways, walked onto the grass median, looked both ways and bounded into the threes.  It was cool and my ex husband watched it too.
Bad news is that this animal is far smarter than most of the human beings running on red lights or in the places you can’t cross the road.
Is this that deer that then went on to chase down and headbutt the little kid?

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingJerks/comments/f8qn5f/caught_this_deer_running_down_a_little_a_little/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) one? Is this why the deer crossed the road?
I had to make sure this wasn’t r/unexpected when that deer started crossing the street
What a lovely deer
Best Deer ever.
I loved animal crossing as a kid. The update could use some tweaks though.
That was not /r/aww that was more /r/SweatyPalms  
  
A deer on the road reminds me of [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1m-K1D_uQs)
It's unbelievable and so nice  that the animal follows the traffic rules.
That’s amazing.  I only wish all deer were this patient.
there were so many people who didn't let it cross
how mean
Smort
wait for it, wait for it
Ba dum, tisss
Seriously, nobody thought of [this lady](https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI) yet
*Doom Music Starts Playing*
I wish American deer were this polite.
Wow this deer knows what's up. In Kentucky, our deer cross the road by running face first into the front bumper.
I spent some time in John Day, Oregon. There are definitely some deer that use the crosswalk there. There are also some deer that just cross the street anywhere. They don’t really give a crap about people, they just eat their gardens and move on
That deer didn’t look both ways. How dare she.
I'm still not convinced that those animal bridges aren't a fucking terrible idea.
I’m glad this wasn’t on r/unexpected
Oh deer me, humans fail 2 times! We (as pedestrians) don’t always use crosswalks, and we (as drivers) don’t always respect others and let them pass.
Drivers don't give a rat's ass about a deer crossing.
Now, if only *people* could learn to use crosswalks.
Doom eternal
Ooop, yea. No grass here.
She’s so patient!
A nice little fellow waiting for a calm and relaxing walk
Even Japanese animals are polite ...
Damn.
I like how it even used the crosswalk
Today she's using a crosswalk, tomorrow she's returning fire. Everyone seeing this has been warned.
That’s impressive! As they never stop!
That's a weird looking dog
Oh Nara
It's the Oh Deer crossing.
They finally listened to Donna The Dear Lady!
Where's the deer shadow tho? Not trying to be THAT guy, jw.
I was scared someone coming from the other direction wasn't going to stop and just hit it, but then i saw what sub it was lol
adaptation of the fittest
Fucking Nara Japan

Surprised that fucker didn’t harass the camera man for a cookie lol
New leaf
Yup! He didn't deer to cross before everyone stopped.
Nara?
Hurry up!
Asian driver, no survivor for sure
Wow someone who finally knows how to use a cross walk and yet they’re not a human
I would like one copy of Doom Eternal please
Animal crossing new BEEP
What a beautiful soul who stopped and respect animals.
Where I come from they wait until you're moving and run in front of or in to the side of your car.
so many identical cars
Sure, a wel-mannered deer is interesting but I don't understand why the top comments aren't all about the terrifying number of minivans.
r/gifsthatstarttoosoon

Edit your gif damnit. My data cant handle wasted deer gifs.
Omg so funny 😂
Can you walk any slower, ya joker!
So...even the deer in Japan are smarter.

Meanwhile, I'm in the states slaughtering the suckers while going under the speed limit in sparsely populated areas.
Awesome 😊
Not just for zebras anymore.
When animals are more civilized than human pedestrians
At least run across bro!
I wish deer in the US did this instead of just running straight into the side of my car.
The new Animal Crossing is looking pretty good.
I would have happily stopped for him. I hit a deer this December that jumped/ran in front of me and it did almost $5000 of damage to my van.
As an American that loves vans... this video made me so jealous.
He must be in high school with that slow-ass, don’t give a damn, walk across the street.
After the second car you could tell the deer was mad they didnt stop.
r/maybemaybemaybe
Why did the doe cross the road?
Blockhead intensifies 
https://youtu.be/NhheiPTdZCw
This dude jaywalks less than I do
Took way too long for someone to stop, holy deer.
I was hoping this was /r/unexpected for a brief second lol
March 20th couldn't come sooner 😭
The new graphics look so good!
does anyone remember that audio of that woman calling a radio station saying that deer crossing signs should be moved to school zones so it's safer for the deer.

The audio: https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI
silly deer, thats a zebra crossing
This is so cute.
/r/HoomansBeingJerks
Woah, a deer that doesn't totally freak out around cars.
Aww. This reminds me of the family of deer that crossed at a stop sign. Wish I had dashcam that day.
Oh dear can’t believe it took so many cars to finally stop. But I suppose it is a zebra crossing which may of confused drivers.
It’s exploring new horizons
When you're so high that you think you're a moose
So what’s the hype about this game? /s
City deer
I ended up getting mobbed but those lil shits, so I tossed a handful of cookies and booked it the other way.
Looks like Nara, Japan.
r/technicallythetruth
r/likeus
Looks like Nara. The deer there can shut down the whole inner city, it’s awesome how they just wander around and everyone has to stop for them.
I'm glad this wasn't part of the Doom crossover event
"Hmmm animal crosses the road.  Nah I'm not going to stop to watch this magnificent creature do something so unique."
This isn't animal crossing!
Nice someone stopped for him. They’d hardly do it for a human
I want you to notice that this deer even bow his head to say thank you to the driver.
Here in colombia people die crossing under walking bridges on 3 lane wide per way highways. This deer is better than most colombian people crossing roads.
People are such fuks. Just stop.
[deleted]
He even walks across it as slow as humans.
Lmao that’s so cute. In the southern US it feels like they are trying to get themselves killed lol ..
Take your time why don’t ya?
I thought this was gonna be fucked up till I saw r/awww
My cat would look both ways before he crossed a street
Certainly wasn’t filmed in Central Pennsylvania. It usually happens in reverse here, where the deer with just stand in the middle of the raid. And when you try to drive around them, that’s when they move.
Take your time, why don't you
Kinda rude, pedestrians get right away
What a Wild World
In New Jersey, deer just jump out in front of car - sometimes actually crashing into cars.  Wish they could be more civilized like their Japanese cousins.
r/ithadtobejapan
that slow walk back from Tom Nook's
May this smart little deer reproduce and be the mother of all future deer!
Such a nice dog
So stoked for this game.
Glad you didnt choose DooM.
r/animalcrossing
This is so wholesome, I love it
With a little bit of urgency, please! Lol
He scooted across the street
What a patient and polite neighbor. We need more like that
It's reaching a New Horizon
Nintendo has entered the chat
Is this in Asia? Everybody is driving the same car.
I waited the entire to time hoping he’d get there safe
Love when someone walks slow as shit in the crosswalk in front of me after I let them go. Asshole.
I’m a simple man. I see Animal Crossing, I upvote.
Yet some idiot humans can't do the same thing. Lol. 🤦
Took his fucking time tho
I wish the deer in Minnesota were like that... they practically jump into our cars here.
The squirrels at my uni use the crosswalk. It’s so cute
All those people who just didnt let it past need to turn over a **new leaf**. Its a **wild world** that we live in for this to happen.
Thank you, deer!
Kinda weird. I’m not big on animals and even I stop for all the entitled ducks we have down here in Florida.
In Illinois that deer would have jumped in front of every single vehicle.
By all means, move at a glacial pace. You know how it thrills me.
Takes his sweet time going across don't he
Take your time. There’s no predator chasing that car or anything.
It had to be a Japanese deer, even their wild animals are civilized, so cool
I thought it was a zebra crossing
Why did the deer cross the road?
I scrolled away from this video when the animal started to cross and right when the video was almost off screen i saw a van fly by and I thought they ran the animal over.
Oh, it’s Nara!
I still don't get why people like this game so much.
Vampire deer
Calm as a hindu cow meanwhile my old dog, who never lived in any other place other than an urban environment, would be as calm as a sheep at a New Zealanders stag party.
took way too many people to let it cross
I love how she takes her time lol
Finally saw a zebra that forgot to wear his coat!!!
Where is this, exactly? Those car drivers were so rude and heartless with the deer.
Thats a civilizated country. Keep notice. Yes you
People suck...
i find this incredibly sad
I’ve seen cats and foxes use zebra crossing and traffic light crossings in the UK.
Excuse me but.... WHAT
Even the deer are polite and wait their turn in Japan.
Hm I can kinda get behind all the hype now, I might have to buy the game when it drops
That driver who stopped deserve Cookies
People are in such a hurry, they can't stop to let the poor animal cross, it had to make a motion it was going to go regardless.
These videos always blow my mind because the person filming definitely thought he was about to watch this deer get hit
The only smart deer. He shall lead his species to greatness.
This game looks sick what mods?
Zootopia
Lol needed this today
Nara? Nara!
This reminds me of that radio show that had a woman call them to complain that the deer crossing signs were in the wrong spots and the deer kept getting run over.
Must be a teenager. Taking its sweet ass time crossing when people are waiting.  Lmao!
Do people not know traffic laws!? Let the damn deer cross!
The drivers don't stop for people, why would they for a deer?
They are adapting!
Thats the new game! WOOOOOOOOOW
In America we can't even get cars to stop for brown pedestrians (true facts).
What a mad animal... its a zebra crossing, not deer crossing
That is impressive :D I always got the impressions deer(s) were quite stupid! but that shows an impressive amount of knowledge of what would fuck it up
If only deer where I’m from did that instead of just fucking kamikazeing into the side of my fucking car
Animal Crossing irl
Took way too long for someone to stop.  Let the lady cross the street.
new horizons
Standing at a crosswalk while the cars just speed by? This HAS to be Italy!
Hate it when I stop to let the pedestrian cross and they proceed to cross at a snail's pace.
Je gave that one van the same look I do when the dont stop.
Good title.
I was audibly yelling at the people who kept driving by and wouldn’t stop to let her cross.
Deer is pointing at the crosswalk....lol
FINALLY SOMEONE WHO LET IT CROSS!
Taking this long to cross the street, looks like a New Yorker.
Wow! A deer that actually waits for cars to pass!
I can’t believe so many idiots just drove straight past. You’re supposed to stop because the animal could unexpectedly jump in front of you.
I hate when I stop for a pedestrian and they just take their sweet time crossing.
"Don't mind me..."
Let the damn doe cross!
Looks like Nintendo is smashing everyone in the next generation of consoles.
Why did the deer cross the road?
I wish the wildlife would do that here,. Too many close calls
What a polite deer
Probably thinking "how long do I need to wait for someone to stop" this is a good example of patience.
She takes her time
One smart deer 🦌
it waited for it’s turn
The Japanese don’t disappoint
Evolution on video
Crossing the road to pay his debts to Tom Nook, no doubt
He knows what's up
It will be awesome if that was a zebra.
How did the deer cross the road?

Very paitently.
Is that a picture of a deer on the bus?
What a well behaved deer.
You could say..  ありがとう、日産!
Crossy road
That deer has more respect for crosswalks than most university students I have seen.
Considering I hit a deer driving home a month ago this is something else
I was expecting a Naruto run like in the Taconic Highway, NY
The deer in Nara or Miyajima will ignore you if you don't have any food.  
I have seen people get hurt by these animals, they are not cute little fluffy things, they are dangerous.
Deer is more civilized than me, damn!
Reminds me of the woman complaining about a deer crossing.
https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI
Can’t wait to play this game on my Nintendo 3DS.
That one asshole who sped up when the deer was trying to cross
Doesn't use mobile phone, when crosses the street
 I thought my mommy said video games aren’t real
It’s amazing this deer was able to learn how to cross a road and not die by watching humans stand _riiiiight_ about *here* and eventually the big box thingies stop moving and it can walk across and not die.\
If even takes its damn sweet time, too.
No thank you wave?? Pfft, F that guy.
This is so pure and I’m so tired and this is making me emotional.
I like how it starts to inch in cause it knows people won’t stop if it doesn’t lmao
Look at all those asshole drivers failing to stop at a crosswalk.
Omg!!! That’s soo adorable. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I picture it thinking "Ugh these cars take forever!  Oh, thank you kind driver.  Do I want Starbucks?"
This is not the animal crossing I’ve been waiting for. MARCH 20th CANT COME SOON ENOUGH.
Animal Crossing: Wild World
Just go ahead and take your sweet ass time, mr deer
Smarter than most humans lmao
This is in Nara Japan.  Deer are like the city’s mascot and main tourist attraction.  There is a hefty fine for injuring these deers.
Its even using the crosswalk 😱😍
how beautiful and the driver who also let him cross
If only people in New York were like this
In all seriousness. That is not natrual.
Nopunintendo
Except they’re supposed to stop when someone’s using the crosswalk. I guess animals don’t apply. 😪
I was waiting for the deer to get absolutely clocked by a car speeding in the opposite direction.
If that was a person, he would have given the drivers dirty looks.
Rude ass people. Animals have rights to!
Too bad it wasn't a zebra. Still nice.
Good to see that someone stopped could have been a long wait or get hit
Half way through I had to make sure this wasn’t r/yesyesyesno or r/idiotsincars just to stop worrying.
He's probably off to New Horizons.
Animal crossings always remind me of this. 


https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI
J
Animal Crossing New Horizon's graphics are looking so good
I wish the deer in SD were that smart.  They jump right in front of your car.
Where's the thicc dog waifu?
Love how this deer actually knows exactly what the zebra crossing is meant for
I thought that this was a different subreddit and that it was about to go a wildly different direction.
I just hit a freaking deer last week
smart deer
A civilized gal in a civilized town
Reminds me of this lady that called and suggested that deer cross at deer crossing signs 


https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI
Ya‘ll got some ugly ass looking cars in the US
This deer is better at following the law than I am
/r/donthelpjustfilm
Hi I'm from Perú I don't know anything about this place but the name of Nara remember me Nicky minaj saying: "Pero hice todo este llanto por Nara! :V

This is sad, when you think about the fact that we just build roads in the middle of the only home these animals have.. 🥺
I don’t understand why no one was stopping for him.
Wow the graphics for new horizons look great
...so is this what the game’s like? Never played.
I expected someone to smash into it on the other side.
little thing took his goddamn time LOL
The most impressive thing to me is that fact that even though one side let it cross, it didn't assume the whole road was clear and still checked.
He's so polite, waiting for his turn.
Is this that game everyone keeps talking about?
Typical pedestrian. Holds up traffic and walks 1mph.
How cute
Very smart deer
Just takin my time on the riiiiiiiiiiiiide 🎶
[And everyone thought this lady was stupid..... ](https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI)
I wish the deer in norther Michigan would use the cross walks. At the very least look both ways
r/anxietygifs
They’re adapting
He sure is
Damn, New Horizons looks lit!
They’re evolving.
This deer is more responsible than a lot of humans.
New leaf
New Horizons
Damn they made New Horizons look really realistic
Fuckin stop theres a pedestrian in the crosswalk.
The new animal crossing graphics have really improved
All pedestrians should be like that deer.
Nara?
Those Japanese cars are oddly satisfying
Funny, my teacher mentioned this in biology today.
Ofcourse this happened in Japan.
What a polite cutie! :)
The Elk and Deer in my town walk down the sidewalks and use crosswalks in the winter time. It's quite the site.
There's a park near me with loads of deer and a road running through it, on 2 separate occasions I've seen deer wanting to cross and waiting for someone to stop and flash their lights, it's both hilarious and adorable
Way smarter and less vindictive than NY deer
drivers should stop for pedestrians in the crosswalk. 

Or equestrians. 

(Assuming no light here).
😍🥰
YOU ARE ALL VERY RUDE. PLEASE STOP FOR THE VERY SMALL COW!
That’s crazy. They’re learning to cross the street just like we do
[There will be no living with her after this.](https://youtu.be/RFCrJleggrI)
Deer, driving on the left, big arse crossing, tiny white truck thing - must be Japan
This deer is smarter than alot people...
Wow. Nintendo really upped the graphics in the new game.
It should put soap up its ass
ngl he do be vibin doe 😳
So many twats that did not stop. Shame on them.
r/antimeme
Upvoted for the deer, eventhough it doesn't give a shit and has no conceptual understanding of Reddit eitherways
Now if only they were this smart in Pennsylvania.
/u/vredditdownloader
I guess it must be heading toward **New Horizons**, huh?
So why did the dear cross the road?
Is there a subreddit for this?
Why did so many cars pass before letting the deer cross? Gotta stop for pedestrians
A deer that doesn't jump into oncoming traffic. We need more educated deers.
Watch that deer slowly shuffling across the street like she's a pedestrian in DC.
So polite.
Man look at that nice tight white fanny on that donkey. Uugghh
Man even the Deer are old in Japan
Oh dear.
Wow the new Animal Crossing game looks so realistic. Such a change from their normal cartoonish feel.
How come this deer is more respectful than the one that damaged my car? 😠
Wow he used the crosswalk what a smart guy
i was waiting for skrrrt POW
All the Kei cars :)
Can’t wait, gameplay seems great
u/vredditdownloader
A true successor to the doggo one.
r/wholesomevans
That deer lost its driver's license. It is no longer fucking around with the laws of the road.
Whoa, this might sound silly... but that’s one smart animal.
Smart! My dog would have run out there carefree
But it’s his right of way! Those first few cars are arseholes
Saw a family of raccoons do this one night.
New Leaf
Oh deer

These animals showcasing their intelligence when they are forced to interact and live around humans.
Now imagine if the deer didn’t stop...
Now coming to Nintendo switch
He even bows at 21 seconds
Why are their deer so much smarter than the ones state side?
Does "right of way"  apply to only humans? So many cars kept going so rude1
He or she has seen to many of its own die.
Or mama taught them well.
That's technically the truth
Knees to chest, deer! They got places to be!
Well...
How polite
Man the new game has such great graphics
😂😂😂
I saw a squirrel do this once, and on the other side of the road was a peanut shop. Wish I got it on film.
Wait. Why didn’t it jump out in front of any of the cars at the last minute? 

This doesn’t gel with my personal experience with deer at all.
Punk ass bitches who don’t stop sooner. Fuck all them.
When you play a Druid in a modern day campaign
Like a BOSS!
civilized bebe :)
Awww that nice fellow stopped for it
Can we bring these brainiacs to the USA! Constantly seeing deers aimlessly jumping into traffic
Good human and smart animal
What are these squared cars?
i really expected someone to come speeding thru other side of street
[removed]
That deer needs to come to Michigan and teach our deer
Oi! I’m walkin’ here!
Don't help just film.
Is anyone else mad at long it took for someone to stop?
The dumbass dear waiting for my car to go by to then jump
Ngl, I got upset at each vehicle that wouldn’t stop
I love how it bows to say thank you :D
Japanese deer are the best
Why don't they stop for him sooner?
How rude!
I have stopped to let a crow cross at a crosswalk before. He just stood there waiting and then hopped across.
We live in a society.
“Just a small town Doe, living in a lonely world~ She took the sidewalk to the other end...”
And such a polite deer, too.
I always find it interesting how animals interact with urban setting. They see a lot of different things from what they are used to. Some of them freak out and start running around breaking shit or causing a scene. A lot of them kinda adapt to it. They probably find more food there than back where they came from. This fellow probably saw several of his kind get fucked by a car. So probably it thinks, “damn, let me not run in front  these weird fast things.” They probably think if they act calm like these other animals “humans,” they will be left alone. That’s why you see pigeons take the subway.
It's really crazy the deer understands the concept of a crosswalk and knows where and when to cross totally amazing!
He’s so patient and polite! How could all those other cars not stop?
Cause that’s what heros do
What kind of idiots drive past a deer? That deeer don’t give a high he’ll jump or infront of your car
On his way to get one copy of doom eternal.
If only all animals would wait to cross the street.
New Horizons
Everyone who didn’t stop needs to be put in jail
Maybe a little late to the party, but isn't that a zebra crossing?
 
Edit - yeah. Late to the zebra party again.
They're evolving.
STOP AT THE FUCKING CROSSING.
New Horizons
I love minivans
Definitely have some practice. The deer around here tend to do a panicked half somersault and then more likely than not dart *into* the road in a blind panic when a car gets close. If you are lucky to slow down in time they will then run in the middle of the road in front of the car for the next several kilometers if you don't just stop completely and wait for them to decide it's safe to leave the road again.
American deer just tend to yeet. This one is so well behaved.
Reminds me of Marty walking through New York in Madagascar, miss that film.
Smart dogo
He's on to 'new horizons'
I'd walk at that pace too if I had to wait that long at a zebra crossing
😱 theyre evolving. Why did so many people keep driving ?! Rude
STOP ALREADY!
Japanese cars just said 🗿
MRW someone finally obeys the law to stop at crosswalks
Is that a dikdik maybe? It looks sorta like a dikdik
Absolutely lovely
this reminds me of humans that take their sweet ass time crossing the street when they know they are holding up traffic. rude
Has more patience than most pedestrians I’ve seen...
I saw something similar in Yosemite where a coyote walked a hundred feet or so down the side of road until it reached a crosswalk and then used the crosswalk to get over to the other side of the road.
Animals just adapt
Animal crossing new leaf looks great
Bruh that's a deer with the head of a cow...
That's absolutely crazy. Law abiding wildlife in Japan
People pay to play this game?
