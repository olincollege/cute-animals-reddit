No.. your sister's dog is anxious because your sister made it sit on top of a Roomba and he/she doesnt like it.
Does anyone know the breed!? Beautiful dog 
tail tucked, eyes bugged, head hunched, ears laid back

i don't think the dog is the strange one here. 
No way that dog did that on its own. 
Is the dog just small, or am I just really misinformed about how big Roombas are?

Last night my furnace broke and for a lot of people in the Northeast, the current temps these past few days have been -10C to -20C with wind chills putting on an extra -10C. 

I made a last minute run to Target and bought a space heater. Later on I get high and come up with tremendously great and terrible idea. A roomba that carries a space heater on it.

I ended up realizing how bad of an idea it was.

If you're interested in the ways I thought I could make it safe, continue reading.

I tried to think of ways to incorporate safety measures but there's no easy way of doing it.

You could try to train an AI to identify plastics, and other flammable objects. But really I don't know how well you can teach the AI that, especially in fabrics. I believe the only way to be 100% certain in what the material is to collect a sample and test it.

I also thought about radius prevention, but some objects can catch fire rather easily.

Lastly, I never had my own space heater before but I noticed some claim to use "infrared". Don't know if there's any truth to the claim, but metals can react strangely with radiation, at least to my limited understanding. Microwaves have a lot less energy and silverware can fuck that shit up quick.

I don't if he's happy or not because the way he looks, it looks like a bit pissed off but enjoying
Maybe he feels like if he‚Äôs on top of the vacuum,it can‚Äôt eat it. I also read once that if a dog gets to move places without him doing any work it causes euphoria. Not sure if that‚Äôs real or not tho

r/casualanimalabuse
When your owner won't take you for a long drive while allowing you to sit in the front seat with your head stuck out the window, sometimes all that remains is the opportunity to sit on a robo-sweeper. 
I don't know if you guys  (edit: or Gals, MY B!) know this, but when dogs are in motion without the dog using its own legs, their brains have a difficult time interpreting this. It creates a "Euphoric" type of feeling for your pup. This is why they all generally love to stick their heads out of the window of your vehicle. It is also likely why puppies and a small subset of the population of adult canines get carsick and vomit when they are in the car.

Neato is a better brand and what I wish I got. My parents own one.
OP is an asshole for making his dog sit through this shit, when we all know the dog is ready to get the F out of there, it's a vacuum. 
My roomba hits a fucking vent & needs moved manually. I‚Äôd love to know how these assholes are still running with a pet sitting on them

I wonder what would think its wolves ancestors if they saw that
Can't fear it coming after you. If you're on top of it.
This is exactly what i would do if i could 
This is so hilarious.
Best thing I've seen the last fef days
Thinks he's a cat.
Looks like he is riding into battle its adorable !
Awww it reminds me of kids chasing the poor dogs with the hoover sucker
Sooo long human. 
Hey can anyone identify the breed of the dog in the background? 

The reason I'm asking is because I picked up a dog just like that dog from a rescue organization, and I met a guy who picked two of them up from the pound, so neither of us know what breed this is.
He face looks like Wile E. Coyote before the dynamite  goes off in his face.
The robots have started their takeover and they‚Äôve found their leader.

That's one big cat.
_They see me rollin‚Äô they hatin‚Äô!_
That‚Äôs a big cat
I've honestly surprised how powerful the motors are on those things.
This video needs to be longer. 
I wish mine would like our robot this much
I'm surprised that the motors have enough torque to move around with a 40+ pound pupper on it.
Adorable 
That‚Äôs no dog, that‚Äôs a Cy-bork!
I mean who doesn't like a free ride
That dog has the eyes of a 14 yr old anime girl. 
They see me riding...
Are you sure that's not a cat in disguise?
Sure, for a baby or a cat to do it, its normal. But if a dog does it, its all of a sudden strange 
He/she isn‚Äôt strange! They‚Äôre just trying to help clean their owner‚Äôs house!
ITS NO DOGGO
This is the Professor X of doggos.
He is a king, and that is his steed.
Servant, get me away from this human mess!

*beep boop ok*
Reminds me of Ed from Lion King
This dog would love the Cat In The Hat ride at Universal
Strange? Thats a genius move

I must go, my people need me
No real dog would do this. They are both robots.
I think he‚Äôs just getting ready to shit on the carpet.
Should the Roomba be recalibrated....  it‚Äôs missing a lot of spots...
Robodog.
We also have Glaurung just so you know. He‚Äôs a tabby cat though so I didn‚Äôt mention him.
That dog is a G

BEWARE OF DOG 

WHO ACTS LIKE CAT
Modern problems require modern solutions
....Does your sister's dog happen to bork instead of bark because he was abused before she got him and took the time to teach him how?
I saw this exact video yesterday so how is it your sisters dog?
Wasn't this posted yesterday by someone else? OP has no post yesterday with this vid
I‚Äôm in tears.  
Strange?  I‚Äôm actually a little jealous of that pup. Looks like fun!
A cat spirit took ever him
I can't even get my pup to chill when I try to use my handheld vacuum üòÇ 
No your sisters dog is being abused
Lol who fed that dog chocolate cause he's fucking sick 
"I'm just not completely convinced about this new public transport system, Mike"

Get out of here Gallowboob we know its you.
He's like "I hate how much I am enjoying this"

Somebody from the future posted ‚Äúyour sister‚Äôs dog‚Äù yesterday. It‚Äôs a funny vid and you should watch out for that guy. He has the drop on you.

Edit: he had proof. now I just am wondering what I saw yesterday. if it wasnt this gif then it was another good boy on a roomba. theres no way I dreamed it.
This is your dog? Someone just posted this like 3 days ago...
Other dog is like 'wtf'

Moon eyes

nervous lick

sitting on tail

that dog was put there.
Why are there always angry animal activists in the comments?
Came here to say the same. Amazing how people are so willing to put their pets (and children) in uncomfortable and even dangerous situations, all for the fleeting approval of strangers. 

On a lighter note, that is one gorgeous woogie!
Not strange. Obedient is the word you're looking for. That dog doesn't want to be there.
Forced dog is forced karma is not cool.
Saw this posted close to 4 or 5 days ago. It isnt your sister's dog.
Why does eveyone on reddit call dogs "doggo"? It's fucking annoying.  Fucking hivemind.  
Yeah, i don't think the dog is to blame here.
Lol my favorite part is the bigger dog in the back looking like "The fuck are you doing?"
I could watch that dog ride that vacuum until it ran out of power.

More footage!!!

He's a happy puppy.
