I bet that felt great.
..goes to wipe snot on provider.
When your eyes are crossed for 12 seconds just before you sneeze YOU KNOW it's going to be a good one!! LOL
Not mine but I saw this edit.

How many RPM did that get? Jesus, that was quite the sneeze.
Omg, yes! He looks like a cartoon!

Edit: r/unexpectedhogwarts
"You're a sneezer, Harry!"
Professor McGonagall has quite a wind up to that sneeze
I really enjoy how often the thing on TV in the background of videos is Harry Potter.
Watching videos of cats sneezing is now one of my favorite things
Expecto pasneezum
Oh my goodness this was adorableüò≠ I think this would x-post well in r/oddlysatisfying.
A cat doing something cute, Harry Potter in the background, and a controller in the shot. This is peak reddit right here. 
That's exactly what I look like when I'm trying to grab a sneeze 
[Classic Sneezy!](https://youtu.be/FZBo2wBH0zE)
I just jumped 20ft. Someone in the cube next to me sneeze right as the cat did
Mrs. Norris or Professor McGonnagall there? I'm confused.
Doris Crawford Mr. Whiskers. I can't believe you are sneezing at last.

Edit: And I just realized I totally missed an opportunity for "Doris Pawford"
"Bless my soul...it's Kitty Snotter!"
-the guy on tv
Do you live in a hotel room?
If that cat didn‚Äôt go through with the sneeze I would have reported this. 
With Sound - source? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEouPsKUB4s
If you stop at the time of sneezing his doin the shibedrill thing
The woman in the Harry Potter movie turn round just in time to watch the sneeze.
Boogerus Expellum!
I feel like I need to sneeze now
You know that feeling when you are about to sneeze like this but it wont come out? It kinda ducks but happens to me alot, so Idk why but I thought he wasnt gonna sneeze because of that lmao
And where is my tissue mortal
I could barely see the cat because I was too busy watching Harry Potter in the background.
[deleted]
Harry Potter nice!
*Harry snotter????*
I would have thrown my phone in the bin if that cat ended up not sneezing.

Don't need that evil in my life.
Seen this at least 5 times in the past month.

*upvotes anyway*
I love it. He even levitated for like 1/49 of a second lmao
You‚Äôre allergic Harry
Was that a snart?
I didn't even need the sound on to hear that massive windstorm.
Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies... achoo.
The nose wiggle is adorable üòç
I was afraid it was gonna end right before the sneeze, the suspense was killing me. 
OK, i don't mean to be creepy, but are you located somewhere in the bay area?  our kitty looks almost exactly like yours, we found her as a stray in los gatos about a year and a half ago:

Bless you, little kitty
Bless you cat.
I see you are celebrating Harry's birthday today. 
I watched this more times than necessary. 
I'd want to boop his cute, little nose, but then the poor thing probably would just have to sneeze again.
That sneeze had recoil 
Almost gave up, but the payoff was worth it lol 
Replace the sneeze with barf and you have my cat 
clean your room
Cute! Now close that bottom drawer!
If your cat is sneezing regularly get them checked at a vet. As adorable as cat sneezes are, a plugged nose will kill a cat.
Dramatic cat is dramatic.
He's allergic to kids movies.
Cover your mouth cat! Disrespectful 
That clip had more tension then every movie I watched in the last 2 years.
The anticipation is palpable.  
Happy birthday Harry Potter my boy 
I like how we all have evolved to be so different, but still all our noses need to poot sometimes.
Harry Snotter and the Order of the Kleenex
nothing is more irritating when a cute gif won't load for me. 
OMG can someone please photo shop this so it looks like he's charging up his laser or he's going super sayan or something?!?!?!  OMGGGGGGGG
Is that an Xbox 360 controller?
I felt that over here in Texas!

Bless you buddy
Yasssss Harry Potter in the background lol
I see your also watching the harry potter marathon 
Clean your room!

-Mom
I think its allergic to cats 
You're a sneezer, Harry!
This made me sneeze
The video was pixelated for me at first, but the moment he sneezed it snapped into focus. A sneeze that can change video quality...dear God
I had to watch again because I automatically focused on Harry Potter
Bless my soul, it's Hairy Snotter!
Couldn't stop watching Harry Potter in the background 
Sneezus-Maximus
You're a wizard, Mittens. 
BLESS MY SOUL, ITS HARRY POTTER
I wonder if cats get the orgasmic great feeling when they sneeze like we humans do. 
My 4yo watched this about 20x. He laughed hysterically every time. 
Yer a sneezard arry!!
Oh god that face is so freaking CUTE!!!

I love when cats sneeze so hard they lose front traction.
Almost a liftoff there.
Harry Potter and the Feline‚Äôs Sneeze
I was expecting that cat to blow.
Omg I was woken up by one of those this morning. It was one of those wake up right as they sneeze so you just get a face full of sneeze. He looked strangely pleased and just wiggled his butt as he jumped down, like "well, my job here is done."

He's an asshole.
Meme thief
Big repost incoming from like, 2 days ago?
Was expecting a nuclear explosion clip when he sneezed. But this is fine
Yerr a wizard 'arry!
Is this a repost? I think I saw this before...
This cat probably has Nasopharyngeal Polyps. 
Polyps are generally benign but can grow and lead to respiratory distress and breathing difficulty. 

https://m.petmd.com/cat/conditions/respiratory/c_ct_nasal_nasopharyngeal_polyps?page=1
Someone get this in reverse, stat.
I'd be awesome if someone could make it to where all his fur falls out 
This was posted (again) because of the background Harry Potter, right?
Do you by chance live in the flint area? because that looks very similar to my old cat that I sent back to an animal shelter
Never seen a harry cat sneeze before
I have one of those! Super cute cats
Big Sneeze Vibes
Aww thats a cute cat <3
Allergic to muggles
I sneezed right after him.... -_-

Huge sneeze!!

Finally! The anticipation was killing me.
Ahahaha those crossed eyes!
Is that the 22 bucks PDP Amazon's XBOX One controller? If so, how much would you recommend it? 
Loading_Sneeze.jpg
Thank you, really needed that smile today .. (: 
It weirded me out the first time I heard our cat sneeze. I guess I didn't realize it would sound just like a human sneeze. I have no idea what I had envisioned it would sound like. 
THE WAND CHOOSES THE WIZARD MR POTTER
That is a damn good looking cat.  Keep up the good work, kind cat owner.
my spirit animal, every july and august.
Harry Potter leaky cauldron scene!
This looks like something out of a Pixar movie! Too cute.
The way the nose area twitches is so cute hehe 
I was subconsciously holding my breath until the cat sneezed
I feel like that cats head exceeded the speed of light on that sneeze. It went back and forth like 4 times in .2 seconds can we get an accurate calculation on this please? 
What a payoff !!
I don't know about anyone else, but I truly felt the relief when the sneeze finally hit! 
Cutest thing ever, OMG.

Btw, is that the Gears controller?
aaaawwwww the eyes :'D   


remembered me on grumpy smurf <3
Ending was worth the wait. 10/10 would watch again.
Woah it's head *vibrated*
When the sneeze occured, its head went into a state of flux... üòÅüòÅ
That gave me that lingering sneezing feeling. Thank God there was an actual sneeze. 
Console peasent DansGame
My cat sounds like someone stepping on a tiny elephant when she sneezes.
My dog would do the same sitting in bed with my wife and me.  You could tell it was coming.  Luckily he aimed it at my wife about 75% of the time.  Guess I was his favorite!
Is there a YouTube link? I'd like to sample that sneeze!
Top notch. This is what I come here for.
That was the greatest thing i've ever seen.
I even feel better now ...bless you
That was so cathartic. 
where's the slow mo on that holy shiiii
He woulda been pissed if he lost that sneeze 
Did you at least say "bless you"?
Watching this legit made me sneeze.
r/teefies
can I get a slow mo of that?
That was awesome!!
The characters on the TV also appear to be waiting for it.
Wow!
I had a similar cat (named Fat Cat) that was nuzzling around my face, then he let go a massive sneeze.

Looked at him with a "thank you so much, fucker" expression, then he turned around and jumped off the bed. My wife saw the whole thing, and laughed her ass off.
Epic, well worth the wait!
And the appropriate movie for this festive day, as well! 
HAUMEAU??
I feel like there‚Äôs one more left in him 
HAHAHA
I‚Äôm laughing at the mental image of someone sneezing right at the moment in that pub when everyone gets quiet and notices Harry Potter.
Looks like how the wolf talks at the end of Never ending story!!!!!
The title sounds like that MW2 tactical nuke incoming sound effect. 
This made me genuinely laugh out loud
Bless you
Yay!
*YOU'RE A WIZARD HARRY!*

Upvote for Harry Potter in background. 
hooza sneezy baby
that is such a big cat ohmygod
I love the fact he sneezed as soon the bartender realized he was Harry Potter in the background.
Due to my allergies that‚Äôs what happens to me when I get near cats and dogs which sucks bc I see these and wish I could get one
I expect a gif of the cat exploding as a repost within the week
The first time I saw my cat trying to sneeze I got scared because she just started trembling and making weird sounds
the crossed eyes

I'm dead, that was so cute
r/HarryPotter approved 
Cat is just allergic to the older Wizards‚Äô bullshit. Yes, they‚Äôre all happy to meet Harry, but for no reason besides the dinner conversation.

‚ÄúHoney what did you do today?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh I met Harry Potter.‚Äù

I‚Äôm guessing the reactions would range from ‚ÄúMerlin‚Äôs beard!‚Äù to ‚Äúholy troll farts!‚Äù
Damn that is the craziest sneeze I‚Äôve ever seen from a cat. lol üòÇ 
Right after the first bout of sneezie sniffles he smiles like the Cheshire cat üêà
I score that kitty a perfect 10 for keeping balance with a turbo powered sneeze! Well done, bravo!

Am I the only one annoyed about the sound cutting off right before the sneeze? 

Am I the only one whose sound is cutting off right before the sneeze?
Gesundheit!
Not gonna lie, I was fully expecting a cut to an Unexpected JOHN CENA...
Well this is adorable...

I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt fall off the bed! Achooooo!

Got yourself a cute sneezy boi there OP :)
I like how it looks like Harry Potter characters in the background stop to watch the sneeze
I need this in slow motion
Whoah... I also have a fat sneezy lynx point!
I would love a super slow motion camera to film it, so I could see what the cat's head does when the sneeze happens.
ITS HARRY POTTEH

SNEEZE
That was a helluva build up.
And a helluva payoff.

Need a looping gif of the second the sneeze happens. Infinitely spinning cathead.
My cat when he would sneeze would always end up near my face and splatter me. I was convinced the little demon did it on purpose. But one look at his face and I couldn't be mad.

Sigh.

Cats really do have us trained.
Cat boogers allllll over that bed
Crookshanks!
[this cat looks exactly like mine.](http://imgur.com/ud3DKr0) 
"Mad and hairy? You wouldn't be talkin' about me, now would ya?" 
Uhh...  that scene was on my screen simultaneously
You know that feeling when you are about to sneeze like this but it wont come out? It kinda ducks but happens to me alot, so Idk why but I thought he wasnt gonna sneeze because of that lmao
It tickles me that cats sneeze the same way humans do
Never knew cats sneezed!
Bless my soul! It's Harry Potter!
You're a wizard Larry!
Whoah
When our lab/pit sets up for a sneeze, I take cover. She got the back of my legs a week ago or so. Yuck!
What breed is that?

Looks like he's gonna change outfit after that sneeze spin.
I‚Äôm surprised he didn‚Äôt turn into professor Mcgonagall!! 
Hammy's gonna sneeze ya!
Would've been awesome if you'd been watching porn, and realized you only had time to grab either cell phone or remote before sneezacalypse
I don't normally login to just save posts because I am too lazy to...But for this post I had to.
The suspense watching this was incredible
What kind of cat is that? Used to have one that looked exactly like this one named Ty, but I never knew what kind of cat he was.
Dunno about aww those claws came out
Your lynx point does a great Kenny impression. 
Just realized I've never seen a car sneeze irl. 
finally holy moly
This made me think of Crash Bandicoot at the very end lol I'm sure kitteh busted up those boxes and collected the wumpa fruit with that hellacious sneeze. 
Gunshot
I thought only yawns were contagious until I watched this *sniff*
Here I am looking at HP1 on the TV in the background lmao
I'm laughing so hard!! ü§£üòÇ
Needs more explosions at the end
Sneezed so hard his head did some spinners.
Can we get a slo-mo of the sneeze?
This looks like a hotel. Are you traveling with your cat or does that part of your bedroom look like a hotel for some reason to me?
his feet came off the ground lmfao
You're a wizard Harry 
I'm surprised no one mentioned it looked like a Crash Bandicoot spin.
The eyes lawl
Your room looks like a hotel. or at least reminds me of a hotel. Cute cat

This was cute and funny at the same time
Love those crossed eyes.
r/whyweretheyfilming
See how the kitty's head became a blur during the sneeze?  Mine feel that way.  Like my head explodes into a cartoony blur, then snaps back to reality.
The world breaker 
What are you watching?
I had a dog trainer once tell me that dogs and cats dont sneeze for the same reason humans do. She said they only ever sneeze when theyre nervouse as a defense mechanism. I asked her why killing machines like canines and felines would sneeze in self defense and not attack with its sharp teeth and sharp claws? She responded with "why would they do that?" I never saw her again. 
My question is why do you buy a wired Xbox controller instead of a wireless one if you‚Äôre going to be that far away from the tv anyways
I sneezed while watching this.
I almost missed the sneeze because I was watching Harry Potter. 
Oh Mrs. NORRIS is filling Harry Potter‚Äôs Goblet of Fire with that sneeze!!
Tactical nuke incoming 
Cute
I want to sneeze so badly now.
When my mom sneezes she says ‚Äúaaachuuu‚Äù wicked loud! We give he such grief for it!
And my mom always called by tiny little sneezes ‚Äòcat sneezes‚Äô! She never saw this cat sneeze!
As a cat owner, I felt that spray from here :P 
r/Unexpected
Ali-a intro 
LPT: If you ever want to keep yourself from sneezing, just press the bottom side of the tip of your tongue against your top teeth as hard as you can.
Blew the ears right of him lmao.
Reminds me of [this poor puss](https://v.redd.it/h06mmcaqtur01)
If humans didn't sneeze we'd all be wondering what the hell he was doing and what kind of illness he had.
If this was my cat I would have to get the hell away. When he sneezes he leaves giant boogers everywhere. He left a giant one in the middle of my legal pad the other day.

  


My wife thought I was wiping boogers on the wall because his boogers are so massive and he leaves them all over.
YOU'RE A WIZARD HARRY
I read the title and that still made me jump...
HP SZN baby!
Lol that was so powerful, I flinched when he sneezed

ELI5: Why do cats shake their heads when they sneeze?
Someone photoshop this into an explosion! There's one were a dog sneezes and blows up (probably on r/combinedgifs) and it would make a fine addition to my collection.

Yuck! Troll boggles.

I was just really hoping this wouldn't end up in /r/gifsthatendtoosoon
AHHH MY HEART ESPLODE!!
Lmao Harry Potter in the background.
This made me wanna watch harry potter
I love how the people in the movie look away or down after the sneeze. Nothing to see here...
Must be allergic to muggles
Looks like he‚Äôs allergic to cats too
Totally made me sneeze
This needs to be a loading screen somewhere 
That was Cat-astrophic. 
I upvoted this before he even sneezed. 
Yer a SNEEZER, Catty.

At least you had Harry to keep you company while you were waiting.
I got distracted by Harry Potter. 
My English teacher would SCREAM  before she sneezed and then proceed to let out a dainty "choo"
Sneezed so loud made Harry Potter queef! 
Someone needs to put an explosion effect here.
My sister-in-law the veterinarian told me not long ago to watch out for sneezes from our cat, as that can often indicate a problem that needs looking into.  Occasional sneezing by humans is generally harmless, but not so with felines, she says.
Who else was watching Harry Potter instead of the cat?
"I'm allergic to that nerdy wizard shit" -Cat, probably
Good kitty and very good movie
Aww, cutie!
Beautiful cat.  Looks like a Siamese mix.
I couldn't help but notice Harry Potter playing on TV
when u bust a nut but she keep sucking 
I wish my head could safely do that when I have a massive sneeze like that.
My heart just melted awwwwww
I hate when you get those big sneezes and then nothing happens and you‚Äôre just like what is my life? 
It was so concise
That‚Äôs the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen in my entire life
That must have felt good. 
I got a series of sinus surgeries last month and this has literally been my life as I recover.  Huge buildups to sneeze with the most RIDICULOUS sneezes.

I empathize with this cat.
You're a sneezer, Harry!
I've seen this at least a dozen times already but I have to watch it several times over every time it shows up again. It's one of my favorite things on the internet <3
I see you also watched Harry Potter and the sorcerers stone last night
my kitten always falls over when he sneezes and then he sits like that for awhile like that was what he meant to do 
What kind of cat is that? I had one that looked just like it as a kid.
HAHA
We all know that feeling 
Your room looks like a hospital.
Have you ever had an experience where your about to sneeze and you want to but then it starts dying down?
I love this
It's probably allergic to cats. 
That was so satisfying when he finally sneezed 
I need to see this in slow mo
His head almost done a 360
What a cutie!
I have that same Xbox! Pretty cool.
Actually made me sneeze!

I actually laughed so fucking happily
I like how he/she kind of went crosseyed. 
Am I the only one that has to play with their controller plugged in on Xbox? It will always disconnect for fractions of a second as if it's too far (full charge/new batteries don't matter) if it's wireless

I sneezed whilst watching it, i think from sympathy
Lmao that was so cute
I REALLY need to see this in slow motion, someone? 
Thats a cute dog
*CHARGING SNEEZE*: 79%
Oh my god, this is the best thing I've ever seen.
Damn, that head shake was so fast! 
Should have stopped the clip just before the sneeze to piss everyone off. 
Aww! That felt great just watching it lol.

It didn't disappoint
Good choice in movies

So your cat sneezes in the presence of Lord Voldemort? That means we dan expect great things from you...
Is it possible to count how many times  his head twisted side to side at the end?
I'd say it was allergic to cats

I like how there's Harry Potter in the background. Great way to celebrate his birthday. 
My dog sneezes whenever he is excited/happy. One time, he sneezed so fucking hard that he pulled a muscle in his neck and then proceeded to scream and run around the house in pain for about five minutes. The vet didn't believe me when I explained to her that he literally fucking sneezed and acted like he was dying.
that little jump. too cute. bless you lil fella!
This is like the 10th time ive seen this posted but this is reddit so i shouldnt be surprised it made it to the front page for the 10th time as well
One time my cat sneezed in my mouth. We were rubbing foreheads. I was baby-talking it then outta nowhere- Bam! Cat snot in my mouth. 
Cat tried to enter slipspace, failed initiating hyperthrusters.

Your post delivers. 
This gets reposted every other day and it always gets to the front page. You gotta love classic Reddit.
I hate big sneezes like that, always makes my head hurt and i fear I snapped a vein in my brain
u/mrkuddlesworth
Can we get this but with an explosion at the end?
Nice repost!
Who else was wating for the cat to fall off the bed from sneezing so hard?

I thought either that or it would just collapse. 

Either way I feel relieved after seeing that.
Cat.
Gonna be honest, only stopped because I noticed Harry Potter playing in the background. I Do not regret anything ‚ö°Ô∏èüëç
I'm glad cat sneezes have been caught on video. I've never managed it. They are so satisfying. I've caught some good cat yawns, and of course my cat licking his feet and toesies and grooming his ears and head. So after I catch a good photo of him jumping up and down things this will be the next goal. 
So happy for them
Holy shit I needed this laugh. What did we do to deserve animals

All I could see was Harry in the background. ^.~
Oh man this was a really big part in the story too. Harry finds out he‚Äôs important and not just some unloved kid
You could have at least gave professor McGonagle a tissue even though shes in cat form. 
I hope that sneeze was as good for the cat as it was for me. 
I wish that sneeze was in slow motion! 
Really should end the gif just before the sneeze. 
I love that cats shake their heads violently when they sneeze!
That nose wiggle and Harry Potter in the background, I was half expecting the cat to do some kind of magic spell or transformation.
sneeze approved

I just imagine the lawn mower rev engine goin after a hard tug, and it just being looked perfectly to go with the engine haha

I like how the tv characters look like they are watching the cat sneeze. 
Can we get a slow mo ? 
Reading this made me sneeze 
I like your choice in movies! ;)
Something something Harry Potter 
Professor McGonagall is sick :(
The finale reminded me of a crash bandicoot spin üòÑ
I opened Reddit and saw this title, then immdeiately sneezed. A lot faster than the cat, but still thought that was notable
Prof. McGonagall is already tired of Harry's bullshit...
I like how the people in the movie behind him all looked in anticipation right before he sneezed
FUS-RO-DAH!
That made me feel like I wanted to sneeze haha
The drill power tho

There it was.




*Edit, a letter*
I am the god of that thing where you‚Äôre just about to sneeze and then your friend is all "hey, what's up?" And you suddenly freeze but then you still have the nose tingle, it's a horrible tease and you're like Fuuuuuuuuck!
Yer a wizard Harry!
Do you live in a hotel?
Who else appreciates HP in the background on HP‚Äôs 38th bday? 
Aw, that looks exactly like my cat that ran away. Makes me miss her.
I thought for a second the video was going to end before the sneeze.
Im staying at my sisters place in the country and the reception out here isnt stellar. The video stops loading at 9 seconds every time. Biggest case of blue balls (blue vag cuz im a girl?) I've ever experienced.
Watching Harry Potter on his birthday. Nice.
I have a cold right now and this is me in every sense.
Cat sneezing needs to be filmed in slow motion.
Would love to see a to be continued meme out of his 
That was fuckin cute
My gawd the nose wiggles leading up to it just kill me, right in the freaking heart. Too much.
I was kinda hoping for crap all over the place based on title
I am actually Harry Potter as I stumbled upon this...
Bless my soul, it's 'Arry Potter
That was explosive

Hairy Potter
Wow I take sneezes for granted I wish I could sneeze right now lmao
And you didn‚Äôt say bless you?
I wish the slowmo guys were there.
Double karma for the Harry Potter 
You‚Äôre allergic Harry
This cat looks like it could be named Hagrid. Happy Harry's Birthday!

I need this in slow mo.
Clock that HP in the background. Watching Prisoner of Azkaban right meow!!
HARRY POTTER!
Oh my fuck
Wash that controller.  And bed.  And TV.  And walls.  And cat.
Oh come on, that would have totally made a perfect r/gifsthatendtoosoon !   Go back and cut off the last second.
There's no cuter sound than an animal sneezing.
Upvote for Harry Potter on in the background 
I spot harry potter
I laughed way too hard at this 
omggggg blessss you kitty. You such a good kitty. c:
Whew. OK, stay right there, I need to wipe my nose.
That was cute
The sneeze that was heard around the world.
This cat looks like a robot
You‚Äôre a wizard harry 
Well bless you
Where's that one random everything expert to say this is a dangerous symptom of the cat allergic reaction to the foot odor he's inhaling, that the cat shouldn't be hesitating this long to sneeze and needs to go to the er immediately b4 his brain ooze out his ears
What a funny cat )
I was so anxious it wouldn't come
That looked like a very satisfying sneeze.
My sneezes are mild, and because of this no one ever says, "bless you"
"These humans are giving me a damn allergy"
Bless my soul it‚Äôs Harry Potter 
That was great lol
It was difficult watching one thing of beauty over the other. 

But somehow I manage. 
Sneeze dang near tore his head off
You are soooooo good looking !
Karma cat 
He better turn around or he's gonna miss Quirrel's first appearance.

‚ÄòEllo ‚ÄòArry
Did the car go crosseyed?
That's my favorite movie.
Awwww presh üòçüëå
If this was my cat, it would be followed by a string of 8-10 smaller sneezes.
*TACTICAL NUKE INCOMING*

YER A WHEEZER HARRY
Waiting for that sneeze was like waiting for a rollercoaster to drop lol
That was more suspenseful than A Quiet Place
That sneeze was a work of art
Omg poor baby that was huge üòÇüëèüèª
Idk about anyone else but when my cats sneeze they have more boogers than me when I do..
magical snizzle
Cat people=Harry Potter people
You're a wizard harry 
Yer allergic Harry.
Can we do this slow motion? 
I had to watch this twice because I got distracted by Harry Potter in the background.
Allergic to HP?
She goes cross eyed for a second beforehand. She knew the best sneeze ever was about
To go down.
Going cross-eyed looking for that sneeze.  Glad s/he found it. 
Bless him
Looks like a disney character, so cute!  
Maybe he's allergic to cats.
Hairy Snotter is that you?
I wish I could edit [this](https://youtu.be/UfTR-WyYNRE) in to the sneeze...    

but alas...     I have no skills.
OMG!! Make this in slo-mo!
big ol kit-kit snoot shoot.
I like how it lifts both of his front paws off of the bed
I had to watch this a few times because Harry Potter kept distracting me 
I could literally feel it till here... 
I was kinda hopping the car would fall
I physically felt that cats relief after it sneezed
I can relate so much, even the shifted eyes
I just lost my cat that looks like this.... 6 years. I miss my Q-tip
This made my day 
He finally sneezed! Sometimes I want but Can't and feel so hard!
Finally! Something even the cats aren't immune to! 
This is my favourite thing ever
Sounds like an attack from a pokemon
"YOU'RE A WIZARD HARRY!!!"
So cuuuuute :3
When you pre-sneeze so hard you go cross eyed. 
You're a wizard HAA -- CHO! 
The power of Christ compels you! 
I do the exact same thing when I have a stubborn sneeze brewing, Lick my nose a few times, then shake my head violently as I sneeze, The force of the shaking should have killed me thousands of times.
That‚Äôs a good boy
R.I.P. nose 
Sounded like an airsoft gun, jebus 
‚ÄòARRY POTTER?!?
Your a lizard harry
Chamber of Secrets?
