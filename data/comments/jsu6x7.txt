Imagine if every time you saw someone you love you screamed as loud as you can.
She's so loud, she's got to be saying I CANT HEAR YOU, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

I love her so much.
Your screaming cloud is adorable.

I have a cat that screams like this all the time, he's not deaf, just an asshole.


Love that lil lunatic though.
Omg she is so excited when seeing her owner, absolutely adorable
The three at the end were the best 😂😍
My cat came RUNNING in when I started playing this.
That’s @clarabellethekitty!
That is so nice!  Awwww...

I have one similar.  She's named Bullseye, for the candy.  She is a white longhair with carmel colored patches, 20 years old (90+ in cat years) and still has a ton of energy.  She's the sweetest cat you'll ever meet.

She's been hard of hearing, slowly going deaf for years now.  She sleeps on a soft rectangular bed with 4 high sides we put on a table one day while we were cleaning.  She crawled into it and claimed it for her little bedroom.  Now she always sleeps in there.

She's so hard of hearing that sometimes she doesn't hear me come into the room while she's sleeping.  So as to not startle her, I blow gently on her head to let her know it's time to wake up.  Then she gets really excited to see me.  Love that cat!

*EDIT:  Cat Tax from yesterday.*

Posted multiple pics for me missing that.

i love deaf animals who can’t control their volume, so they just S C R E M
I have a cat like this but he's not blind or deaf he's just really loud unless someone says "hi max" or "hello max" or just until you pet hin
i am the kit who cannot hear,

it's silent in my world...

but i know when my human's near

cuz she's my favorite girl

n tho i don't hear when she talks,

the most important part -

her smell, her face, *i feel* her walks

i listen

with my heart

n in my quiet, as i sleep

it's her i'm dreaming of

forever in my heart i keep

the sound

of human Love

❤️

edit: *thank you for your kind words - if i brought even a bit of happiness to your day*

*then that's enough*. . . 

*please save your awards for someone more deserving!*
That good kitty deserves all the windows to look out!
I love this cat!!!
What a sweet little puffball.

My twin toddlers just made me show them this video 3 times in a row
she's deafinitely excited!!!!!
OMGOMG IT'S YOU!
The little mews are the best
As cute as this is, it only reinforces the fact that I’m allergic to cats and can never own one, sucks to be me.
One minute is not enough of this wonderful deaf baby
This really makes me realise how infrequently I see a cat taken by surprise! So sweet!

My cat's not deaf, he just does this
Thats a good dosage of dopamine
so sweet
Why was this only a minute long? I would have watched hours of this! What a sweet kitty!
Though I'm pretty sure at least half of those are annoyed yells at getting woken up and yelling "THE HELL YOU WANT, HOOMAN?!"
My mother in law has a dead cat. Does the same exact thing. Their meow is so obnoxious but I mean, what else can be expected from a cat that can’t hear itself

EDIT: Not going to edit. The typo is too great
Cat said you still alive mf
Me in the toilet at work, also deaf as fuck because I forgot my volume was at maximum

HEYYYY....
0:34 was the cutest thing ever.
she scream
This is my favourite video on YouTube. I think I watch this every other week.
About six months ago we took in a cat that showed up on our front porch old, emaciated and with a large sarcoma growing out of the back of his neck.  And he was deaf.  We didn’t know if he’d live another week, but today, Loud Grandpa is 100% better, cancer free, and we recently moved him into the house from his garage sanctuary.  Like that little fluffball in the video, Grampy doesn’t have any volume control.  But we’re all getting used to it.  And we love that old guy dearly.
I forgot it said *deaf*and not *blind* and I kept thinking *Wow, those are the clearest looking eyes I have ever seen on a blind cat. He looks up right in the direction his owner his walking in from too... wait...I think I got this wrong.*
And then there’s [this...](https://youtu.be/Iw-9XH6KiOk)
Look at the sweet little scream queen!
I have a deaf cat and when I come home she becomes so loud it’s even scary
Oh....sweet baby! 😘
Omg she is so cute!!!
So adorable
My persian kitten has the exact same yell. We say that her only emotion is "scream"!
I really need to see this kitty get some pets after each of those meows
That’s literally adorable
Them vampire teeth though.
Does anyone know the name of this floofer?
It really makes you think why we're attracted to these animals.  If you close your eyes and just listen to the noise this thing makes, it's horrible; like a cross between a screaming monkey  and a hyena.
I wish my cat was like this. i walk in the door and she stares at me for a few seconds like

HUMAN, YOUR PRESCENCE IS MILDLY COMFORTING TO ME

We have two deaf cats and they both react almost the same. Deaf cats are the best!

I have made another exception.
My cat is not deaf and is acting like our house sprung a leak and is sinking in the middle of the ocean because of these noises.
My heart ❤️
Can confirm that deaf kitty is best “cat-caller” I’ve come across. My cats are up on the bar, looking at deaf kitty as if to say, “Yes???  You have our attention, Oh Loud One.”
That video woke up all the dogs in the house!
I have a pure white deaf cat. Can confirm, their screams are extra loud. When he can’t find other cat he’ll walk around the house screaming. Super adorable.

I’ve always wondered if people who are deaf sleep really well or if other stimuli are just accentuated
I've seen this before but never with sound on. My normally super chill cat started pawing me and decided to bite the side of my hand out of excitement. 😅
Love it, Tho she's actually saying: finally, you're home! Now give me the food already!!
This is my friends cat. I went to highschool with her. It is really cool to see this make the front page.
Sounds about the same volume as my 18 y/o kitty who has decided that sitting in the basement bathroom and screaming at the top of her lungs at 2:30am is a really fun past time. But she falls asleep on my pillow with her paw on my shoulder almost every night, so that's absolutely worth being woken up for on a regular basis.
Was the cat always deaf? Like how does it know to make the meow sound? Just curious ? Like how deaf people pronounce words wrong because they can't hear them
I have a serious question. Everytime I watch a catvideo with sound, my own cat will react instantly or totally not. Can cats understand what kind of “meow” they hear?
She didn’t react to this and I think it’s because it is a positive meow.

Is it true that some cats of certain colors are more predisposed to deafness? For some reason, it sticks in my mind that white cats were  more likely to have this disability.
This is Clarabelle and she is PERFECT! I’m obsessed with her, she’s my fave insta cat for sure.
Precious angel 💖💖💖🥺🥺🥺🥺
We had deaf kitty who was only 99.9999% deaf and the little guy must have been able to slightly hear himself in our bathroom (wet room, so tiled flooors ceiling centre drain jobby)

Kitty would sit dead centre in the room and... not meow but BOWOEEE BOWOWOWEEE BOEWEEOWO with a clear b sound and the tiles made it echo around the whole house.

 It was like the old guy had a servents bell that he would ring and people would go to him to open windows, feed and give him belly work.
I love this 💕 not sure if my Siamese is slightly hard of hearing or a deep sleeper  because he always greets me so loudly like this 😂

My cat went deaf recently. I didn't realize that it happened, but she was meowing really loud all the time and finally I tested her hearing. She does the same thing as the cat in the video when you surprise her. Makes work zoom calls more interesting too!

My dog loved this video.
My cat growing up named Cookie was deaf. He had the loudest unruliest “meow” because he couldn’t hear himself. You could hear him through the whole house, so you’d know generally where he was at all times.

One day I went to a friends for a sleep over. My house caught fire in the middle of the night and my parents were both heavy sleepers. There was smoke billowing out of the basement, and to the rescue Cookie starts howling like a complete maniac waking my parents in time for them to call 911. He was a hero. Deaf cats rule.

Omg I had a def cat and she meowed so loud it was insane. 
When she got really old she started sleeping in the attic right above my bed. If she got startled by another cat in the night she would meow and it would reverberate through the ceiling, blast through my room and wake me the fuck up!
That's really interesting.  I used to know a deaf dog but she didn't bark or make any other noise.
My heart is so full  it's leaking out my eyes. 😍

Deaf cats are far from disabled. From what I learnt of a friends' cat, they still can "hear" you coming through vibrations.

Also, every white cat with eyes with a different colour (heterochromia) is deaf.
OP shame on you. You promised a minute but it's a second short. I demand more! But seriously that cat is beautiful.
My blind cat freaked out when he heard it lol.

I didn't know I needed a full minute of a cat meowing
I love how cats have specific meows for specific things. You can hear how it’s always the same little love scream. I love her.
My heart, it is broken
I don’t usually like cats,  but this one is so damn cute... so fluffy.
I'm curious was your cat born deaf or did it onset later in life? My understanding was that cats don't naturally make verbal noise like this unless they have grown up learning to communicate with humans, but if your cat is deaf from birth how would it know to make any noise?

My childhood kitty lived to be 23 years old and was deaf, mostly blind, and had no teeth by the end. She would get startled and meow like this every time she saw my girlfriend at the time it was so adorable.

So adorable.

I read somewhere that cats really don't meow much to each other.  Meowing is what they do to respond to humans talking.  

Would a cat, deaf its entire life, meow at humans, then?  Or could meowing also be something more than a greeting?  Maybe like someone honking their horn to signal "I am here", so they don't get stepped on?
Oh it just makes me so happy 😁
This is one of the cutest things I've ever seen! She's beautiful! And I love the little confusion time right after she wakes up.

TIL that a deaf cat sounds like a regular Siamese.
My cat is deaf and reacts the same way!
Just curious: was this cat deaf from birth? My understanding of cat behavior is that most of their vocalizations are done for humans. Cats become verbal when they are raised with people making sounds. On their own, they are not loud animals. I am interested how this cat picked up this behavior,
We must protect her at all costs
Have a deaf cat. Can confirm that she is LOUD. Also sometimes she gets lonely at night and seems to forget (?) that we’re all in bed - so we have to bang on the floor until she comes to find us in our bedroom. 

She’s 120% dumb & 150% irreplaceable in my heart. I love her so much.
I love this squeaky lil baby omg
I love the window she’s sleeping in 😍. And the cat looks so fluffy and soft. 🥰
Oh my God the kitty was like “AHH oh your home!:)))))”

This is a new one. The one I keep seeing has the cat on a glass table, but now she seems to like the bay window. Interesting evolution. That cat still adorably screams though.
Actually this was a video on YouTube where the poster/owner named “Surprising my deaf kitten when I creep up behind her”

Sir, I am gonna half to stop you. I was cheated out on 1 second. There is only 59 seconds of excited kitten. You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
That cat is adorable and this is awesome
This is the best minute of my life
I would watch a full movie length video of that kitty doing this
I would put a nice comfy bed on the window seat for her :)
I. Will. Give. Up. My. Life. For. That. Kitty.

That's a definite awwww momment.
I thought cats meowed in response to human voices. How would a deaf cat know to meow?
Oh my godddd she is adorable.
This caught my kitty's attention and she started purring and rubbing herself all over me. She's never done this before! Can't tell if she liked it or not
That just made my day!
I wonder if all deaf cats have a high pitched meow like that? My cat (looks just like this one but short hair) does it too, but she also seems to end every meow with a question mark. I love her
My best one minute of today !!!
When she said "meow" I felt that
I've had a cat just like this cutie, she passed away 2 years ago
She's an adorable muppet.
dat kitty
Judging by how it makes the same exact noise every time, I think that’s your name is cat
Omg her little yells melt my heart 😍😍 precious girl

Also r/catswhoyell
Excited that her owner is home, or annoyed at being woken up? Lol.
That cat looks like a giant cotton ball! So cute!
This was such a perfect way to spend a minute
I love her ❤️
Every one just sounds like "HIIIIIIIIIIII"
I also have a deaf cat. She does the same thing if we wake her when she's sleeping. I recommend having your phone recording on slow motion to harness a deeper meow that sounds a lot like "NNNNNNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!"
r/PetTheDamnCat
Good, now can we have a 10 mins video?
I needed this
Kitty screaming at the camera not to be filmed
Haha the last one tho so cute!!!
I now have a cat chorus of this video and both my cats meowing at each other in response. And now my boy just bit his sister on the butt.
yeesh her inbox must be ^...^
Can confirm this is how they react. I have a deaf cat and this is her everytime someone comes home. She also screams at us when we leave her downstairs... even when she watches us go upstairs

Awesome cat! Love this
I’ll never get sick of this video
Oh my god I love her so much
Food bringer is back. Feed me immediately

This is the best. We don’t deserve cats

I want a deaf cat now
Extra adorable how the screaming ball of love often doesn’t seem to notice their human has returned until they get really close or gently touch the kitty. ♥️
“Are you just gonna make daddy’s ears bleed thurston?”
I like the part when she meows when she sees the owner
u/savethisvideo
Precious baby!
Normal kitty: meow

Deaf kitty: MEEEOOOOOWWWWW
Let's hope this one works now. Summoning [u/GetVideoBot](https://www.reddit.com/u/GetVideoBot/)

I had a deaf white kitty.  To wake me in the mornings, she would delicately jump up on the bed, climb onto my chest, and let out a meow that people 6 blocks away could hear. 

After learning she was deaf, we rescued another hearing kitten that we named Samantha, which means “the listener.”  The two were always together so when we called Samantha, then Button, the deaf kitty, followed her.   No more searching all over the house to find the teeny tiny deaf kitty.
WRONG. Cats don't have owners. They have staff. (that's what my cat keeps telling me, anyway)
Twist: she's actually very evil and keeps sneeking up on kitty letting out screams of fear, not excitement
I'm Gene Parmesan...
Omg this bb
I MAY NOT HEAR, BUT LET ME SING THE SONG OF MY PEOPLE!!
I was looking at this video and all of my cats came looking and searching for the new cat in the house.
And you don't pet her once in the vid. D:
meeew
Sounds like a Pokémon cry
This video is the most interesting thing that my dog has ever heard.
u/savethisvideo
Wow..
I’m in love with your kitty
N* you home!  Cat probably
/r/PetTheDamnCat/
I miss my deaf cat. He was awesome. We had to come up with weird ways to call him over, but he always came when he saw me wave at him.

Such a sweet boy. He just has zero clue how loud he was, so at night when he meowed for something you could hear him from the street!

Maybe this one works
Realy cute, but a headphone warning would be nice haha
How about this one 

[u/getvideobot](https://www.reddit.com/u/getvideobot/)
I just watched this with my cat nearby. He is so concerned as to why this cat is hollering!
Meeeeooooooowwwwww
Sooooooo fluffyyyy
This is the most wholesome thing I've ever seen
I love when the kitty comes trotting into the room screaming. What a precious little floof ball!
This is what I needed to see
I don’t know this cat but I love this cat
My cats came running, one from outside.
This video woke my cat up jsjzjzbzh
I love this kitty!
My cat just completely freaked out.
I am in love with this cat.  She is the best.
How precious
u/savethisvideo
Aww, she reminds me of our Powdered Donut. She screamed at us like this all the time; imagine a shorter coat, covered in cobwebs from exploring her Secret Princess World, and that would be her. Lost her a few years ago and this video makes me miss her so much.
Well this just triggered the fuck out of my cat.
That little trill in the middle of some of the yells is the cutest ;-; <3
Used to have a deaf boy that would also scream a greeting to people and other cats. 

He would also attempt to scream while drinking water which resulted in concerning gurgling noises. Was shocked he never drowned himself.
My childhood cat went deaf towards the end. It is truly amazing how loud cats can scream. Video does not do justice to the volume I am sure
I'm in love :3
Has this been xposted to r/catswhoyell yet? This little poofball should be their mascot
Why is it that every time a see a video posted about a deaf cat it's always a white fur cat? Is there a connection or is it purely coincidence?
Omg!!! If I could up vote this more than once I would!!!
I wish my cat would do this when I got home. But she just gets mad at me then comes out of hiding as if to say 'Ok, I guess I forgive you. But don't be gone for so long again.'
STOP!!! My heart can't take all this cute! It's about to burst!
My dog is exactly the same! We can come home with our other 3 dogs barking their heads off and he’ll still be laying on the couch completely asleep
Well, that was 50 seconds too long.
How does that adorable deaf cat sense his owner’s home? Smell?
What it is with the full white kitties that they are almost always deaf?
My blind, deaf dog has a voice that’s much bigger than he is too. I love this beautiful kitty!
“...that her HUMAN is home.”

Cats understand the simple truth that they are born free and nobody “owns” them.

“ME *shakes head* OW”
r/Catswhoyell
I love her!
Omg this is too damn cute. 

r/catswhoyell
I didnt know you could adopt snow from winter.
What kind of breed of cat is this. I’m scared of cats but my god I might rethink it....
My 3 month old kitten slowly blinked at me before going “eeeeeeeee” so there’s a response.
She’s like "OH HAI!!" all the time
Isn’t this a old video which OP has just reposted?
omg i want one
What kind of cat is this?
She sure loves saying hi 🤣🤣❤️
Excuse me but THIS WAS ONLY 59 SECONDS. I DEMAND MY FULL MINUTE.
She’s like your own little real life Pokémon!!

This really confused my moms dogs.
This is very sad bc what if the owner comes home one day and like usual no response as soon as she walks thru the door but she gets in front of her cat still no response id fuckin cry if that shit happens
Don't play this with sound if you have cats lol
*happines deaf cat noises*
Aw that is so adorable
This is some top tier r/eyebleach stuff!
Awwwwwh!
Never had a cat bit this video bring so much joy to my depressed heart
I watched this video not realising that my dog was in the room, now I’m hearing two animals that are really loud
I love Clarabelle!
I think the kitty is yelling something along the lines of, “WTF YOU SCARED ME! DON’T SNEAK UP ON ME LIKE THAT!”
I had my volume all the way up and scared myself and my cat.
#"love meeee!"
My cat loves this
My cat was very confused ^^
She so loud and i love it it's like she is telling "I MISSED YOU"
Not to be dramatic or anything but I would die for your cat.
YEAHHHH!
OMIGOD IT’S SO CUTE
I love how when he sees the owner he just goes 

“AYYYYY MY FAVOURITE MF JUST ARRIVED HOME”
I wish my deaf cats meow was cute like that. Instead I get screaming in the bath tub at 3am.
