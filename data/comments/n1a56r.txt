It's sweet how the dog keeps looking back and checking that the kitten is following.
https://happilynews.com/dog-rescues-stray-kitten-by-coaxing-it-to-follow-her-home-in-the-pouring-ran/

Monica Burks couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw her dog, Hazel, helping out the squeaking kitten during the heavy downpour.


Monica, 48, peered outdoors after Hazel, 3, did not come back from her “restroom” break and instead kept drawing attention to a faint cry underneath their shed.

Hazel persisted, staying out in the rain until Monica, from Abilene, Texas, was met by a surprise: her dog trotting down the driveway, the squealing kitten in tow.



Monica has named the kitten Sheba and given it to her brother, Michael, to look after.
My dog did that, too!

She kept wanting to go under the house so I finally opened it up and she came out with a kitten and gave it to us. Tiny little thing, about a week or two old.

We couldn't find the mom, but there was a known feral that no one had been able to catch that often abandoned her kittens under houses and cars.

We nursed the kitten back to health and got her all her vet necessities.

Now we have a grumpy cat that thinks she is a dog.

EDIT: Apologies for not including their photos. I've included two bonus photos as an offering to appease the cat tax gods.

“MOM HELP I FOUND A WEIRD BABY!!!”
THE CAT SLIPPED AND HE PICKED HER BACK UP AND BROUGHT IT IN AAAAH
Hey, your dog just picked her sibling
"Can I keep him? Huh? Can I???"
Milo and Otis went on to have many more adventures...
The way she tumbles and the way Hazel (I think that’s what I heard?) immediately jumps down to help her 😭😭😭
What a lovely friendship 💕
What a sweet girl! And wonderful story to tell about your pets ❤️
It's cool, I wanted to uncontrollably sob in the middle of the day 😭
She’s gonna love you! 

Mom, mom, mom, mom.....can we keep her?
I keep thinking the dog is saying to the cat, “come on idiot I’ll show you where the food is”
"No really follow me. Wait till you meet my parents they are great. Good kibble, a warm bed, and they pet you all the time. You are going to love them, and they are going to love you."
I'm saving this for any time I'm sad.
"They're gonna be cool with it, trust me, c'mon"
This is my dog and this is my dog’s cat.
My big dog found a shivering yorkie poo in a bush on our property a couple years ago. So anyway, we now have a yorkie.
She deserves a lot of treats and belly rubs and that kitten deserves a loving home. Your dog sure knew where to bring that kitten to
From experience this kitten looks like it ended up imprinting on the dog. This can happen a lot with stray kittens who lose their moms. 

What happens is kitten loses their mom, doesn’t know what to do, sits and waits for them to come back.

When kittens lose their moms and are alone for hours eventually they get desperate and that is when they end up “imprinting” where they get attached to an animal that might be able to replace their lost mother.

You can see how attached the kitten is in the video. The dog is kind of shocked but it might be parental instincts that is making them turn and check on the kitten so much.
a baby for *your* baby
Melts my heart like sugar in the rain.
I love seeing dogs being friends with small kittens
Id fucking cry tbh 😭 it’s almost like fate
That dog looks like me playing video games during an annoying escort mission where if you get too far ahead of the NPC they just stop
This is so adorable! OMG I am in love with this dog for saving this kitten. What a lucky kitty and what a wonderful dog!👏🏼🙏💗🥰🐾🐾
I know we tend to humanize animals but you can't tell me that dog didn't genuinly care for that kitty
ah my heart 🥺 Hazel is amazing.
Im sure your lovely dog knew exactly what they were doing. She knew she was safe there and that the kitten wasn’t safe out there so she did what anyone with a heart would do, Bring them to safety!
Look what I found! 
Can we keep it?
That dog is special.  Such a wonderful animal.

Sometimes I get so jaded about life then I see something like this and I'm ok for a while.
This doggone is so kind!
Dogs like “shhhh, let me do the talking”
I love the fact that s/he feels so at home and comfortable that s/he can offer shelter to others. Such a big heart. As humans we say that "we're not beasts" but forget how generous animals often are
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen and I think I'm stroking out.

The goodliest of girls.
Is the dog a Yorkshire terrier/poodle? I had one as a kid and a cat that had a ton of kittens. The dog actually thought he was a cat, and when the mother cat would go outside to run errands she'd leave her kittens  with him and he'd stand guard over them.
I love how she keeps checking to make sure she's still following, and then pauses at the stair to make sure the little girl can get up, then picks her up when she can't make it over the sill. (I'm assuming girl kitten because calico).
Well...I guess I have a cat now
Escort Quests... am I right?
I will not allow my black dead heart to love this---oh my God it *helped the kitten into the house* I needed to see this!
This is my favorite video now. I’ve been showing everyone. I hope they kept the kitten ❤️
This is so fucking adorable! Omg I love animals! They're awesome all the time!
Mom,  she followed me home, can I keep her.
Damn this made my day!  Absolutely beautiful
Wot happened after
Cannot award this enough. Best girl and lucky kitty <3
Mom, it followed me home! Can I keep it?
At first it looked like she didn't want the kitten following her, but then as it went on it definitely looks like she's MAKING SURE it follows her. Good dog!
That is the cutest thing I've seen today.
grats on your new cat
The aggressive head turns to make sure she’s still following are so funny
This may be the cutest thing I’ve seen in quite a while. I’m kinda dying
Oh....oh my heart. It hurts this was to fucking cute.
Hero's comes in all shapes and sizes
Where I am from we call this kidnapping.
STOP RIGHT THERE. This is an illegal amount of cuteness It's exceeding maximum levels.
Now what we need is a follow up where the cat thinks its a dog
Me when the npc I'm supposed to follow walks slow as hell
Bro the dog kidnapped a cat, how is that cute- you don’t know where it came from
Hello friend
Omg, bless this courageous little kitty. So brave. What a companion she'll make
Where can I subscribe to watching these two forever?
Now THIS is some good aww stuff.
“...that’s my dog’s cat”
Covering this as evil yorkie steals kitty from mother

-fox news
At that point you kinda have to adopt the kitten. It isn’t optional anymore
I dont think I've ever "Awwwwww'd 😰" as much as I just did right now.
You need to hire a mud jacker to raise your driveway and keep water away from your foundation. Or tear it out and repour. If you own this house you really need to adress that.
What are the changes the kitten had a mother and he just happened to follow that dog?
"Mom, can I keep it?" 😇
When your pet has a pet.
Haha your dog took it upon herself to adopt a cat for you.
Now that’s wholesome as fuck
Please tell me you/they kept the kitten
Oh. My. God. 

I'd just be like, "Well, I own a kitten now."
Umm no ones gonna talk about how the person filming could have picked up the cat instead letting her go into the muddy puddle?
I'll be honest: I'm a cat daddy... I'm not really a dog person (downvotes incoming), but this one has now a special place in my heart.

Good boi.
I have two small dogs and can’t imagine not keeping a close eye on them at all times while they are outside.  Also, whose recording this?  So you record and at no time try to help the kitten.  This video seems very staged and weird.
u/savevideo
Omg...💕
This might be the sweetest thing I have ever seen. They are gonna be best friends for life.
When your pet fosters different species in your home...
Beautiful ❤️ I wonder what goes on in an animal's little mind when something like this happens. Instinctually, the dog has no reason to want to save the kitten, right?
This melted my heart!! She was like “come on I got you this close get in HERE!” Cute animal videos really make my day!
"Mom I swear this thing followed me home!" 

*"hey dont leave! get back here! She'll say yes I promise"*

"Mom can we keep it?"
Always looking back like "u catching up on me?"
This is one of the cutest videos I’ve seen. ❤️
“Come on kitty! My mommy’s nice she’ll give you some food  and a blanket. Maybe you can just live with us.”
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all day! I can’t stop watching!
"Honey can you pick up some cat food on the way home"
This is the sweetest thing I've ever seen! She's such a good girl 😭
We don’t deserve pets  😞
Human and dog have the same reaction when kitten falls lol
Had an aww-gasm
"Come along child, the humans will help."
Seems like animals care more about each other sometimes than humans do.
Step 1 - Will this thing eat me?

Step 2 - If no, make best friends.
Awww the goodest girl
Absolutely precious!!! ❤️
Precious
Looking at my doggo like “see this now go get me a kitten” :D
Where’d you get your cat at? More like where’d my dog get our cat! ❤️
"This is my house, and you see - you live here now. This is where we get food and stay warm and stuff."
Freeee kitten!!
Alright. That's too many levels of cute going on in this video
Youuuuuuu got a friend in me!
This is amazing
This was so wholesome I was about to cry from happiness
Best video of all time
That’s so heartwarming! Thanks for posting ❤️
Congratulations, you have a cat
The cat is so tiny
Put down the fuckin camera and help jfc
Literally there is no better way to adopt a cat. 

“Did you get him from a shelter?”

“Nope, Hazel decided he wanted a baby!”
“OUR BABY”
That's adorable 😻🥰
Old and karma farmer repost.
Did you adopt it OP?
After it viciously killed it’s mother and 5 other siblings.
That swamp water is now on their floor.  The floor is definitely lava now.
So nurturing!! I just wish this was in landscape so I can fully see how the dog helped the kitten after it fell
I love how she's not sure at first, but by the time they're home she's like, "yep, that's my kitten."
My cat did the same thing 2 years ago except he hated the kitten after brining it home for almost half a year. Now they’re best friends!
"And that how I meet your mother"- kitten to dog siblings
it followed me home can i keep it?
Awwww
I would have no choice but to cry a bit and snuggle my new cat
No two ways about it...we don't deserve dogs
Pet pet!
HOLY SMOKES. She even picked the kitten up when it struggled at the door step ;---; my heartttt. I hope you adopted this kitten, your beautiful dog sure wants you to. She protec, she attck, and most important, she bring the kitten back <3
I wish I could pet your dog. What a sweetie!
Looks like you have a cat now!
Faith in the world: restored.
The dog: Follow my lead kitty.
The kitten: I can’t see the road clearly it’s foggy.
The dog keep close.
The dog: I got chu
Can you please post more videos. That kitten is so loud and cute. Your dog is wonderful for looking after that little baby.
I pity the humanity for being not kind at times with a bigger brain power.
"Come with me! You can stay at my house!"
/r/donthelpjustfilm
It appears your pet wants a "pet".
More videos of these two ASAP! ❤️🥺
And that is how you end up with another cat.
Can we keep him?
"HI. I'm you're mom now, let's go home, we've been waiting for you."
Best girl ever. I LOST it when the baby fell backwards when climbing up the stair.
My dog did the same thing. But with fleas.
Congratulations on your new kitten
That’s so awesome that it was caught on film too!  Wow... that’s amazing.
Omg adorbs!!! ❤❤❤❤
I sure hope the human adopted that little kitty
Omg this is so sweet!!
Kitten herding🐾doggo deserves many treats! Give scritches from me please🥰
Human beings don’t deserve animals. We’re not worthy.
I need to train my dog to find kittens and bring them home!! The only thing my dog is good at, when he’s outside, is finding every single skunk close by, and getting sprayed by them. He is a gentle giant of a German Shepard, that thinks everything in the world wants to play with him
Oh my heart! Sweetest thing I’ve ever seen
Did you keep it
They would've made great siblings
Omg I would die
The big one takes care of the small one
The "Awwwwe" factor in this is epic!
Your pet has a pet!
“Can we keep it, mom?  Huh, can we, huh?  Please?!  Puhleeeaaase?!  I’ll take care of it, I promise.”
Lucky for you!!
This is freaking adorable.
This is precious
“Can we keep it?! Can we?!?!”
Are you sure this dog just isn't a cat burglar?
Look what I found, ma! Can I keep him?
This is staged. Owner gets kitten, dog becomes attached and vice versa, owner puts kitten out in rain, dog leads it back... I dont buy this for a second.
Why didn’t s/he stop filming and pick up the kitten? It’s little and scared.
I guess you have a kitten now.
I’m a man with a big beard. That made my heart smile bigger than Shaq’s feet

My dog did that too, so we let him keep her. Her name is Moriarty... 

She’s got a post up on r/aww at the moment...
I’d love a follow-up video
This is so precious. I’m wiping a tear from my eye 😭
So sweet, please tell me you kept kitty or found baby a home.
Adorable!!!
We all can learn from this. It's so beautiful!
This was about two seconds away from r/donthelpjustfilm material.
Man dogs are the reason why this planet hasn’t been destroyed yet😿🥰
That's freaking adorable
I has got my kitty!
 I didn’t think it could get Andy cuter. And then it. Kept. Getting. Cuter.
I am a big dog fan - never really took to small dogs but Yorkies are the absolute best dogs in my experience as dog sitter to many of them. Funny, bright, playful, stubborn, and above all - deeply *caring* dogs. This video does not surprise me in the least :)
The fact that she only says "be gentle" instead of "Toto, what the hell did you bring home?!??! Omg we have a cat now" makes me very skeptical of this video.


My cynical mind makes me think she set them both at the edge of the driveway and recorded the worrying dog help his family member home for the clicks.
Awesome dog, but I feel this was somewhat staged. I mean, how would someone just so happen to be filming at that moment? Doesn't go out and pick a little kitten the moment they see this happen? Pretty sure this kitten was already home and brother/sister doggo was looking out for them.
That dog stole someone's kitten.
This way this way follow me..
Did they keep it, I need to know
I love how the dog just keeps going back like "this way, come on. Nooo, that's the opposite way, follow me"
That is so sweet, what a little smart pooch
Video recording, and not helping? Not even helping the kitten get up the stair? The terrified kitten was following, and the dog was uncertain.
You don’t film a kitten in distress wading through the water.  Put down the camera and help the kitten.  The dog looks like like it needs some care as well.
This is my baby now
Can totally picture some sort of Pixar / Disney animation conversation going on between these two
“Comon! It’s nice and warm! And we have food! And toys! And blankets! And treats! And my mommy is really really great!”
My heart 😭
This is something from a Disney movie
Aww how the dog helped the kitten to get inside,that's the sweetest thing ever 🥰
This is so adorable and defo no issues of the dog liking the kitten  💖😍
It took me too long to figure out what that mythical tiny clump of pixels was.
The door mat really pops in this video.
Did you keep it?
This is sweet the way cat is following dog!
They just welcome themselves in don’t they
Hey op, if you filmed this, you should fix your sidewalk situation ASAP, then the water pools against your house like that it’s also running down your wall, degrading your foundation/basement. Serious long term house issues like big time. Also sure cute
Heartwarming!
And now you own a cat
Such a great save. Love animals ♥️
This is epic save
Brought it home to eat it, clearly.  Like take out.
“Can we keep it mom? Pleasseeeeee??”
OMG this is just too cute !!! ❤️
This is old, need an update
‘It’s alright I’ve asked her already I promise, she said you can stay for dinner’ 😂😂😂
“I’m just going to stand here and film instead of help, because this is going to get so many likes when I upload it!”
All I can think is that there are two distressed animals and some assholes can't be bothered to put down their phone and do anything about it.
Sweet pup saving a tiny kitten!! Maybe the human could put the phone down and pick up the baby kitten and carry it and the dog out of the water to home??? Just a thought.
I’d be pissed. Here’s this this cat I have to keep lol
STOP FILMING AND GO PICK UP THAT GOD DAMN KITTEN YOU HORRIBLE PERSON!
We don’t deserve animals.
Look ma! I brought dinner!
Anyone got the impression the person filming just has a cat with a litter and put one of the kittens outside to film the dog guiding the kitten back inside? Mostly because the person filming shows absolutely zero initiative to help the kitten get inside and gives a 'come on' as its only help.
Why are you standing there filming instead of going out there to get those animals out of a storm?
Yeah instead of fucken filming it like a psychopath for your shitty views, get off your phone and help the fucken thing. So sick of seeing this shit all over the internet, these self righteous assholes that film shit for views and ego boosts instead of doing the humane thing of actually helping.
Ah yes Cat-napping
[deleted]
...and then she ate it.
Catnapping 101- get someone else to do the hands on work so you don't get caught
When in the reality the dog is like hey owner I just brought you this pest alive,  now feed me treats.
[deleted]
God, I hate assholes that film situations like this, rather than jump for the opportunity to help another living being.
Looking at this video and seeing more compassion out of a little dog, and has more heart than most of the human race.
PUT THE CAMERA DOWN AND HELP!!! The kitten is cold and sad and in the rain, as is your dog.
[deleted]
Look look look hoooman, look what I found you!
This is a repost that originally had the title about the dog bringing home a pet
I don't think the dog bought it home so much as a hungry kitten followed it home.  But still sweet.
God girl? Best girl!
Soooo precious!!!
AWWWWWWWWWUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH❤️
So so beautiful
Camera cuts as the doggo devours his new feast from the comfort of his home.
Dog looks like he wants to eat it
The dog has more compassion than the human. Kitten struggled in the puddle and up the stairs. The human was only concerned about recording it. The sweet pup was the one helping it.
This must be the animal equivalent of "have you been telling people about me"?

Don't be telling Hazel to be gentle when you're just standing there not helping.
That poor kitten must have been terrified. It lost its mom and its siblings. It’s lucky that dog found it.

This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
Can you hear me crying ?
Many many years ago when I was little, we had a St. Bernard that was about 180 pounds. A gentle giant. Sometimes he'd break out and we usually knew a dog was in heat somewhere.  One time he got out and brought back a tiny kitten.  We named him Tigger and had him for 17 years. 

I miss that dog and that cat.
why this is the best reason to get a dog. they can herd kittens to me!
Mom, it followed me home! Can I keep it?

My parents friends had a dog who was very protective of the tabby kitten that he was introduced to.  He often made it a point to scruff her and take her where he believed she needed to be, leading to the cat being named "Spithead" because the poor thing's hair was always spiked up around her neck thanks to the dog.

Spithead's daughter became my dad's cat, and she gave birth to kittens at his feet one morning.  The kitten also became dad's cat.
This is fucking cute mate
That is frucking precious.

I lost my dog last week and this is exactly how she would constantly turn around to make sure I was there. this video hits pretty hard. I would walk her, and then in the hallway inside my apartment she would turn around and make sure i was following her down the hallway like no fewer than 2-3 times, every single time, didn't matter that I was following her 100% of every time ever, she always made sure. I can picture it now. God damn who's cutting onions?
Yeah

This is wholesome. Take my award
I'm surprised that the dog didnt star to bark at her like crazy after entering the house.

We had the situation that the neighbors puppy jumped above the mini fence (about 30 cm tall) and walked around a bit. Our dog was happy at first, because she could play with some other dog, which she did.

But then the other dog got curious and went for our door. The moment she got too close to the door, our dog barked at her like crazy, in her ear even. The neighbors dog was terrified after that, understandably.

We gave them their puppy back instantly, seeing that our dog was hostile to theirs now.
What a great dog. Also, I wish this happened to me.
So the pet wants a pet
The most adorable poochie, So cute.. saved and brought home a very lovely gift to Momma/Poppa ❤
In Germany we say „mein Herz geht auf“.
The best
Gosh that’s so adorable!
This is the good home, the safe people.
Seeing a terrier around a kitten makes me very nervous...must have watched one too many ratting videos on youtube.
What a little sweetheart.
Umm, mom? Dad? This tiny creature (she smaller then me!!) needs help.
This video is an aww after another, I'm melting
If this were middle-aged man and a seven-year-old girl, someone would call the police.

(But seriously, the dog may very well have coaxed someone else's kitten to come home with her, for all we know.)
Of course it’s a calico. The most precocious of all kitties.
Frickin precious!

Wonderful video!
It’s definitely the dogs kitten now. Did you see how it immediately went to love on it when it was home. Too cute 🥰
This is soo cute! I was wondering if you know what mix the dog is? She looks just like my rescue pup and I was not really sure
That is so cute. Your dog knows you are a loving and caring person!! “Come to my house, you’ll be safe!” Haha
Tell me you kept the kitten?! Unless this isn't your video....
The way she immediately started cleaning her once she got inside the house 💕
r/donthelpjustfilm
That's too precious
This makes me so happy.  I'm not crying...ur crying.
We have much to learn from animales
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍🏽👍🏽😀😀😘😘😃😃
Poor mamas like: **dis mine now**
My heart
You have to let her keep her
This really made my night ❤️
This doggie is like, "Look mom, look, look what I found.. can I keep it?"
That is so cute and so heartwarming! Love how the kitten feel and she picked her up 😍😍
u/savevideo
Was the kitten adopted?
Aw haha she found a friend
This wins the internet for today!
My heart! Yorkies are sweet hearts. I love how she was like *step step step stop* “you still there? This way”
That’s a good boy right there
At first it looks like the dog keeps looking around as if to say, "Quit it! Stop following me!"... but then she brings the kitten inside, awww :)
‘Welcome’ on the doormat 🥰
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.
The adamant mew mew mew mew just melted me.
Cats are pretty good at finding themselves homes (or someone who can show them to one). My cat as a child just crawled out of the sewer one day while I was sitting on the lawn. He came up and started hanging out with me and when the day was over he just followed me home and moved in like he had always lived there.

What was extra weird was that he was a Himalayan. Most stray cats aren’t weird breeds where I grew up.
This is so pure ♥️
Awww
looks more like the kitten followed the good girl home, and being the good girl she feels vaguely annoyed but wants to be nice
You are now the proud owner of a kitten lol
N’aaaaaaww
That’s the sweetest!!
Can we keep her? Pleeeeeeease!
The welcome mat 😭💕
no sound?
Doggo P R O T E C C
This is the beginning of your own Disney movie
I guess you now have a cat...
I’m crying. For real.
And who is filming?
Mom, it followed me home! Can I keep it?
In a world of so much negativity, videos like this take away some of the pain
A true "WELCOME" mat. Happy lives to all.💝
It’s great that you caught the exact moment these best friends met one another
Omg what a precious dog you have! Wow I hope you can keep that kitty...🤞🏻🤞🏻
Can humans just hand the world over to the dogs already?!?!



Not the cats. Adorable bastards.
This video needs sound so much!
It’s like a scene from an extra-wholesome version of Oliver and Company
She is a true hero. My allergies are making my eyes water.
Fetch quest !
ITS TRYNA GRAB IT BY THE BACK OF THE NECK LIKE A MOM, MY HEART
Omg that is just so adorable my heart!
It’s stuff like this that makes me tear up with happiness.
Please keep they were made for each other
Someone give that dog all the treats and all the love!!! How sweet!
ooooh my heart <3
I guess she brought home a new friend. Too cute.
And the dog's name is Hazel??? Awesome!
heartwarming... https://youtu.be/iacOzDu09WE
Name that kitten Disney cuz. That’s the story!
Oh my God!  That is the cutest thing!
“Let’s go together and ask my owner if you can spend the night”
It’s really nice but somewhere there’s is a mama cat looking desperately for a kitten :(.
It’s the Animal Kingdom showing us a “Here’s how to get along” example!!! Come on 🌎!!!♥️♥️♥️
So sweet
Omg- I’m in love with both of them!!!! Gave me the good chills as she walked 2 steps and then would look back.  When she helps helps the little kitten by picking him up, my heart melted!
It’s like walking home with a drunk friend you have to keep looking back to check on.
Man this guy really just filmed a kitten walk through a puddle huh.
Doggo was like "hey I know you're alone. I've got a family that takes good care of me." Then when the hoomans are in view. " I know you're scared. It's okay. This is my family. If they take care of me, they'll take care of you." Then looks at the hoomans. "Please, can we keep him?"
This dog knows it’s humans heart. 💓
Initially clicked because that's a cool alley.
Adoption or kidnapping? Hmmm
Awwww
Omg this is too pure for this world
MY HEART
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
I’m crying I’m crying I’m crying
Oh my goodness! What a sweet dog.
OHMYGOODNESS!! I love this so much!’ What a sweet pup!! ♥️🐾
Too wonderful for words❤️
That dog's good at escort missions
Wish my dog brought me back kittens.
So sweet!!
"My dog stole a cat".
I would be so damn excited
To those who think the dog intends some sort of harm:  Dogs often recognize when something is young and feel protective of it.  My parents’ Cocker Spaniel found kittens and brought them all carefully home...much to the dismay of the feral mother cat who caught her partway through the process, lol.  And my Doodle found a baby bunny and brought it gently to us.

Lead the kitty to shelter, nice doggo
So cute.
cat fell and said "ow"
I ❤️❤️❤️❤️ these type of stories
Good jobbu doggo
Can we keep her please
In Neopets, they'd call that a Petpet
Help the kitten over those obstacles yo. You got your karma by then
OMGeebuzz, my heart feels like it's going to explode.
Honest mom, it followed me home. We have to keep it now.
Me when I finally finish Gertrude’s Cat
Awesome
Are dogs legally allowed to adopt kittens?

Because this is her child now.
NONONO, THE WARM AND THE FOOD AND THE DRY AND THE COZIES IS THIS WAY
 Oliver and company
“Can I keep him, mom? Can I? He followed me home”.  This is beyond adorable
THE DOG JUST WANTED TO LOVE THAT KITTEN AND WHY AM I CRYING???
super-r-r-r cute
That’s kittenapping 😤
The goodest girl
Is there a follow up story? I need to cry some more
Zooming intensifies
Yorkies are very interesting with kids as well...

Is this a breed thing?  They're not shepherds. They just seem to have a protective streak of some kind.
This is maybe the sweetest & most heart breaking thing ever. I can rest easy knowing that the kitten made it inside safely though. This is the good stuff.
Lol tumbles so hard off the threshold... freaking adorable.
That dog is such a mama.
Omg - this is the cutest thing I've seen in awhile. Good dog!!
That’s crazy
Awesome
Doggo is like can we keep her😉😻🐶
the kitten was fine. a very plucky, hardy little thing. and that dog was managing the situation without any need for human help.
Me when I’m trying to bring chickens home with seeds
Omg you'd have to keep it now
Aww
Oh my goodness😺
Beautiful story. I’m just shocked that little dog is allowed to wander off on his own like that
That dog has wet paws. 😳
“And now, we FEAST!” 

Jk it’s really cute
omg how precious is this 🥰
Can I have the kitten? Such a little cutie.
You better keep that together, pretty please.
Well I guess we have a cat now!!
I wonder how many strays die annually, kind of sad to think about. Good on this good girl!
Amzz
What happened to the mother?
Come with me smol fren, I have hoomans that can help you
