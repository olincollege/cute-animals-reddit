When that puppy grows up, he's still going to be doing this and then there will be casualties
I’ll take your *entire* stock
That is the purest form of trust, no doubts in his mind about his daddy catching him, I’m melting
Doesn’t even drop the ball. Get that pup in the doggy olympics.
He so cute
adorable
Its go for launch! 3, 2, 1, incoming! Too cute. Thats trust and love. Thank you! I needed that.
Please show us in about six months how you manage that with a big dog, cause i believe he will not stop that when he grows😂

Think we found out how dad got a broken finger.
That sideways jump!
I would jump into his arms if he was my dad too.
Thaaat... was way smoother than it looked at first
Who wouldn't jump into daddy's arms?
Dad is hot, ngl.
That daring doggo feels safe and loved. Good job, owner.
Pretty sure that’s not his Dad.

Trust leap gone right
If my dog did that i would get knocked over
Awww I want this one day
Awww, what a cutie pie and I mean both man and puppy!
What happened to dad's finger? :(
awww this made my day so adorable
This is so beautiful. 😭
My puppy does this to me and it makes my day every single time.  😄
I need to see the grow up in 5 years and the man being knocked out.
That was so *SMOOTH*
I wish I had a dad ...
Perfect landing!
In about a year it will be the equivalent of a bowling ball going down the lane.

What kills me is that adorable side drift after he jumps leaning his whole body in and it's like the cutest trust fall I've ever seen.
It helps that daddy is hella cute too 😍
Alright, now I got to get my cat to do that.
Just love puppies like this. All 3 of mine are spoiled rotten and their favorite thing is sitting on our laps
All or nothing side ward dive
Who's a good boi??  They're BOTH good bois!!

What is with calling pet owners dads and moms?
I want an update after 6 months 😂
I like your counter stools did you buy them on wayfair?
That leap, it melts my cold heart
I just love my fuzzy animals to keep me going.  Can't even imagine existing without a best pal.
So goddam cute 🤩
Nice 👍🏻 goldy
Such a happy good boi!!!!
Dats love! ❤ 😍
Awwwww.... smooch that pooch 💋💋
Z O O M
so cute
I wish my dog loved me that much, he doesn't even like to cuddle
Oh yea, here comes the serotonin
The little head rub he gives the guy's arm after is the best lol
Cute
I wanna dog, what kind??
That sidways jump tho
We keep trying for puppies but only get human babies
Love the landing ❣️
I've watched the this 87 times.
I could physically cry from how happy this video makes me
Honestly, sooo cute! Wish I came home to this everyday
What a unit
OMG  
Isn't this cute?  
Dogs need so much attention equal to babies!
Puppy prepares the sideway leap so that he lands in the right snuggle position.
Damn
Doggo really said “trust fall!”
Perfect jump
Our dog actually jumps up and turns on its back, expecting and trusting my brother will catch him..
Your going to (kinda) regret this when he’s 80lbs heavier lol
Aaaaah!
I love this 😍
It’s all fun and games unless you have a nine month old 100 lb Great Dane that still does puppy things. Don’t get me wrong, still cute and just as lovely a feeling, just hurts a little bit more. Lol
That’s SO cute
Sooooooo needed this after seeing a handful of heartbreaks, sadness and madness the second I get on reddit. Thank you for sharing this cutie pie! Love love love the jump!
10/10
Can't wait to see this when he's fully grown 😆
Golden retrievers are so god damn blessed, I bet Jesus was actually a dog (Chihuahua place is taken by satan)
So cute!
Some days I wish I could rent puppy love like that.

Then get them all excited and send them home to parents, lol, like grandchildren.

My cats seem to have this unconditional love but it's not the same, I think it's only because they know I feed them.
Cutie 🤭
That’s it. That’s all the Reddit I need right now. Good bye.
U wanna see some real speed?!
No better feeling in the world 😭😭
My dog still does that. 

He's 60lbs though.
i want both of them
I will watch this on repeat forever! 🥰
Sweet pup loves!
What a goodest dog
This is my main offensive move in Rocket League!
I've never had a pet before, but little things like this make me want one :'-)
so cute and adorable
This is all I want!!
Good boi
Too cute
That's going to hurt in about 8 months.
We don’t deserve dogs
So cute :D
Gimme that pup
This kind of behavior is fairly normal for Golden Retriever puppies. I have a 9 week old GR puppy and can definitely confirm frequent lap jumps.
Oi!
That’s gonna be fun when he’s full grown.
SICK MOVE!!!!!!
This made my heart melt.... I miss my doggo so damn much ♥️🌈
Lovely scene, dog and the guy, too.
Thats so awesome
This puppy trusts you 100% and will do anything to please you, If you don't take advantage of this and teach it everything you can, you are truly missing out on one of lifes true gifts
Oh, good job, buddy! What a cute fuzzy boi!
I wish my dog trusted me this much 😢
Leap of trust.
big fluffers
Now that's some fatherly love right there
I wanna see gifs of this as a timeline with the puppy getting bigger and bigger as he jumps into your arms.  :)
Aww...Hooman Dad is so proud his furbaby has learned how to play fetch! 🥰

This seems like a Schnoodlementous occasion.
Can’t wait to get a dog . They’re so amazing
Wait can i comment here or is karma mean
I appreciate the slow-mo happening at the right timing
Okay but seriously what’s the breed of the dog here, asking for a friend
My puppy does this but after like a second he just bites and scratches me off, my puppy is a brown chow chow
I love this, wish my dog wasn’t an old lazy fuck although I still love him
Let’s see that same action in a year or two.
Yes YES YESS!!!!!
I just watched this 15 times and it was just as beautiful each time. The bond with another species is the coolest shit. Like ever. ❤️
I need a new heart. Mine just melted
That was seamless pup to lap action! 

Imagine if this was 60fps!
good boy

This slide should be known as the Belly Rub Slide.
I’ve watched this over 10 times and it’s still not enough.
Wonder if that’s how he broke his finger. 


Worth it.
This made my morning.
needed this after reading that "nurses/doctors  what was your why didn't you come in sooner story" thread in askreddit
this is @maggieandherdads on Instagram
Areal plop
Now THAT is trust.
This is so wholesome. I can already this is pupper doing this when he gets bigger.
Such a cutie 💙
So I had a horrible dream about me hurting my dog and even though it’s not real I’m still giving my dog all the love
Awww, That's a trust jump right there.
Imagine getting 213 awards but they are ALL worthless. :D
And he never lets go of the ball. I could watch this all day.
I WISH I had a dog like I’d do anything to have a dog but I’m too broke and in a toxic household to have one 😢
I know it's a good one when I make the "aww" noise out loud.
!remindme 6 months
Perfect landing!!! 10 out of 10!
😭
Lol he gonna be coming home from work and and this grown lab is gonna body slam himself into him But cute now..
Golden retrievers are the best
stupid onions
Judging by the splint on his finger, I get the feeling he might always jump into him that hard 😂
Kind of perfect parking
The jump was timed so perfectly.
he's done it before:)
Aw so sweet 😂
Lunging sploot
Do 5 sets of 3 reps a day, for the rest of your life

gonna get stronk
They're so cute😍
The leap, the speed of the run... Perfect
I find this very cute, made my day
That's a lap...
My pupper is sleeping on my lap as I type
 That looks like my neighbor
I don't have tears.  YOU have tears.
This is where I sign off
You’re gonna regret that when he’s 90lbs!
Dude’s got a broken finger. I speculate these things may be related.
This is too adorable!!! 🥰
Aweeeee this is the cutest!!!
Love the way puppy "leaned into the jump...almost contorting in midair"...or like sliding into second base!
Lots of Love There
The trust some animals have is incredible.
This was honestly r/oddlysatisfying too
This is just the best thing ever
More a jump into his lap, really.
What kind of dog is this
I need this today
my 95 lb shepherd/aussie still does this... it can be "painful"
My pup will protect his mommy to the end, but daddy always means playtime.
Wonderful when a puppy or dog loves you like this ! No human would , only little children ... that grow up 😐
I want to see this when he is 3
More please
What a feel good.
u/savethisvideo
Ahh the proper format. First time play through normal speed, then the slowmo.
awww
Oh the fluff, can practically feel the softness
U/savethisvideo
So sweet.
I don't understand why people keep calling owners of pets "moms" and "dads" of those pets. I own 3 cats that I absolutely adore, but never referred to myself as their "dad".
I can't stop watching
Pupper is getting zoomies, chewies, and scratchies all at once!  What a day!

u/Ysghost1 is this too much to ask for 🥺
#I AAAAAAAM SPEEEEEEEEEEED
Was expecting a satisfying snap like LEGO.
Jumping into owner's arms.
Dad? So its safe to say that your wife is a bitch?
Pets are not your children.
“Owner’s”
Jumping into **dad's** arms

Mental illness is one hell of a thing. That is not a child, you are not a dad.

You are a owner, and that is a dog.

You're not their dad, a dog is.
Cats will never love you like this.
