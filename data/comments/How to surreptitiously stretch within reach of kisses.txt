Cutest thing ever!
The equivalent of stretching out and putting an arm around your date's shoulders.
"I...'ll... just... stretch... and... move... my... tiny... paws... in... your... general... direction... Andnowyoucangivemecutekissykisses!"

The old “Yawn, Stretch, and Reach Across” move. Oldest trick in the book.
Its nice to see bun buns also do not follow the laws of physics. I want some kisses. L E N G T H    I N C R E A S E.
sur·rep·ti·tious·ly

in a way that attempts to avoid notice or attention; secretively.

"Mary surreptitiously slipped from the room"

- Oxford languages
This bun will sploot for kisses. XD
That first little yawn though!!
A most excellent sploot.
my dog is also sneaky like this
rabbit: ok... go with the plan:

&#x200B;

* ^(...don't be suspicious...)
* **stretch back slowly**
* ^(...don't be suspicious...)
* **stretch forward slowly**
* ^(...don't be suspicious ...)
* **stay and get the kisses**

&#x200B;

**^(yes <3)**
This is beyond precious!!
Master of his craft 🐇
That lil bun has got gaaame
Learned a new word and saw some cute bunnies! Ok back to work I guess
That's adorable
Sploot for the win
I’m happy crying, they are so cute
That little yawn tho
Mine just jump on me in the middle in the night and demand kisses...

That is absolutely shameless lush behavior right there .
That's the first time I've watched one of those videos, said aaawwww out loud then looked at which subreddit I was in.
Smol thicc butt

The yawn was adorable, bunnies are the only good thing in the world.
Wish I had someone to send this too. But then again I am on reddit
My ovaries!
u/nerdyninjaassassin ...i do this to you don't I
I'm not even gonna try to lie, I had to Google "surreptitiously". For those wondering, it basically means "secretively".
Sly guy!
What good friends they are!
Playa!!
Bun sploot
Smooth sploot, Bun.
Ooooh bunny sploot AND kisses!
I see you are doing licks. What if, you were to do licks on me?
Me (currently between jobs) to SO (currently working from home)
Omg I’ve apparently never seen a bunny yawn, that was so cute
This brought back some really sweet memories of being a teenager just fumbeling about, being in love, and having really good intentions slightly sabotaged by awkwardness, but not enough to blow it.

It's absolutely adorable, and it made me really happy.
Now i want 2 bunnies
Bunnies look like God gave the tools of creation to a 5-year old and said "make an animal that's as cute as possible". They're not my favorite pets, but it's undeniable that they're cute.
Minimal effort, maximum pleasure:)
I never knew rabbits were so long!
oh to be a bunny getting kisses on a rug
BUNNIES AAAAAAAA

TAKE MY UPVOTE 😭💝
That rabbit knew what he was doing.
This is the cutest thing I’ve seen all week🥰
MY HEART AHHHHHHHHHHHH
This is the bun equivalent of the “yawn and stretch” over ya girl’s shoulder at the movie theater
So, the bunny equivalent of the yawn, arm stretch, stretch over your dates shoulder, then lean in for a kiss at the movies?
Do pet rabbits just go around pooping everywhere or are they potty trained?
I had a bunny and learned the hard way that I was incredibly allergic. Luckily one of my friends was able to take them in.
I've never seen a rabbit yawn. This is a simulation.
Looooooooooooooooooooooooong boi
Awww, my bunny does the same! He stretches and leans forward and I know he wants pets
*YAWN, STRETCH*

*crickets, bunny chewing continues*

I said, *YAWN, STRETCH*

Oh, hey 💋🐰❤️

Holy shit that's pure

Sneeky wabbit! Hahaaaa
Soooooo cute 😍 💓
surreptitiously? how do you say that word?
Well that's an actual aww post
That is a nerdy ass word to use. I had to look that up! Thanks for my new word of the day!
This is my new favorite video
I hate it when i have to look up meanings for new words,  its nice to learn new words but its so rarely used
That never works for me but then again I am not that damn cute.
Damn my weakness for adorable animals. Take my upvote already.
Thank You- my heart feels hugged! and bonus! I have a new yoga pose Kissing Bunnies
My cat does this when we eat, she hypocritically approaches like we won’t notice.
How cute. I remember my dwarf, Butterscotch, dying in my arms when I was in sixth grade. I was devastated. He was my best friend, maybe 20 years ago. They can be the absolute sweetest critters on the planet if you take care of 'em. Mine had a rat terrier buddy, but I love that yours has another bun buddy. ❤
Surreptitiously is my favorite word.
Gold for the title alone
That grey bunny is in charge. In rabbit social hierarchies, the subordinate rabbit does the grooming, while the bunny higher in rank gets groomed.

Fun fact: In cats, it's the opposite. This is why cats and rabbits are often compatible companions: When a cat grooms a rabbit, they both think they're in charge!
Sneaky wabbits. We've had them lots over the years and this is a common sight.

Amusingly enough it works if you extend your hand/foot/elbow/whatever. I'd be reaching over to clean something up near one of ours and then suddenly "Oh, I need to smooch my parents hand!"... followed by them flopping onto said appendage and preventing you from doing the housework that you, well, probably didn't need to do anyhow right?
So cute! I've always wanted a bunny! Do they make good pets? My apartment is too small for a dog and I have family members allergic to cats.
I have the same rug. Sjostrene Grene, I believe.




Why am I the way I am?
Real subtle, bunny.
Thank you. This helped me recover from the first day of school in Georgia pic
The 'ol yawn and stretch. Smooth.
Awww

I should do that. 

Also, bunny sploot

Just tried this and now I'm banned from yoga.
It’s like that “at the movies” arm stretch
Well played!
This is so cute it’s actually making me cry a little 🥺
Bun was innocently asking for kissss
She looks at the camera like "I know what he's doing but he's cute so I'm going to let him continue".
So this is what I gotta do to get kisses
Umm yea, I tried this. Does not work for humans.
OMG they are so adorable ! I want one. Now.
Taking notes here
Ok you win, this deserves top of all time
Bunny has so much game
Im in love with this
That’s nice.

Cute 🥰
How old are they?
Awww super super cute 🐰
Aww
Bunny’s got game 😉
Is the second rabbit licking or nibbling? also, why? (curious bc i've never gotten close enough to a rabbit to work it out).

That actually made me say awww. That was so adorable. This post made my day
TIL my doberman is part bunnywabbit.
I like how it yawns before it stretches lol
Toooo good 😭
"I'm coming to get em"
This is the rabbit equivalent of when a guy stretches as a pretext to put his arm around a girl
I have never seen a bunny yawn before omg
I have never seen a bunny sprawl out like that
This melts my heart.
That rabbit lookin kinda thicc though
Me to my crush
"You silver-tongued devil, you."
TIL the word surreptitiously
The rabbit equivalent of sliding in the DM’s
Oh. My. God. My heart!

Her: It’s ok, lemme lick the top of your head.
Omg sooooo freakin adorbs!!
How can they be so cute?! 😭

Complete with the cool-guy yawn pretending he's just stretching out.  Game recognizes game.
That stretch and stage yawn.
Cutest shit I have ever seen.  **:'(**
And with that, I'm getting off the internet while I'm still smiling.

soooo cuuuteee!!! s2
One of our rat boys does this with his cage brother all the time. Weasley will be minding his own business doing whatever rat thing he thinks he has to do then Sevrus will come over and sit next to him, maybe groom a little, trying to give Weasley a hint. If he doesn't take it, Sev will sometimes just outright shove himself under Weez's snoot.
That's me everytime i want a cuddle
What kind of bunnies are these?
Once again.. cuteness overload ☺️

Aww, how precious! I love them! ❤
Oh to be a bunny being kissed by another bunny
The 90:10 is universal
Does serendipitously mean the same as intentionally?
Awe cute
My dog does this (:
Smooth
Cutest thing I've seen all week♥️
My ex had a Chihuahua that loved licking people, but she would try to be sneaky about it. She would lick/clean herself on the couch and slowly sneak herself closer and closer to you until *whoops* she's licking your leg. When you said her name or moved her, basically let her know you noticed in any way, she would back off and pretend she never did it.
u/stefkie
This is the best thing I’ve seen today.
What does smooth mean though
bunnies want one thing and it's disgusting

OH BIIIIIIIG stretch
Sneaky...
Aww. I wish I had rabbits like this.

The rabbit we have at my mom's house hates everything, and will try to attack you if you touch her food bowl- even if you're just filling it up. Her name is Snuggles (pretty ironic, I know).

The rabbit we have at my dad's house is more affectionate. A little *too* affectionate. Now, he hates being picked up and he has to be in the right mood to allow people to touch him, but he loves people's feet. And no, I'm not just saying he rubs himself against people's feet, he tries to ***hump*** people's feet. His name is Jasper.
Don't mind me while I do my downward dog...

&#x200B;

Aaaand it's time for my cobra ;)
Cute. Very cute. But how do you not have random little shit nuggets all over your floor?
Your kittens look weird.
No matter how well you trim, there's always one long hare...
I do this all the time. 

Stretch and put my face near my girlfriends’ and just leave my face there while she’s sleeping and wait for the kisses.
Maybe credit the youtube channel this came from?

How my boyfriend and I are!
Are those two females? I’d figure if the one on the left was a male he’d be more aggressive toward the other one (either sexually if the other was a female or physically if it was a male).

Don’t bunnies just per and poop anywhere? Nice rug though.
Rest my beating heart 💗
I could go for a stretch like that
They do be chillin tho
