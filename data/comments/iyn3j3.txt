Very polite and sweet cat deserves many treats
Cat.
*Oliver Twist voice* Please sir, I want some more.
I demand you produce a treat at once!
[removed]
Very polite. Good job kitty
I can hear this in my head. I’m sure he’ll be in my dreams tonight
r/politecats
That title fit the cat’s expression perfectly!
DEAR LORD I THOUGHT HE HAD NO ARMS--

After noticing that he, indeed, had arm noodles, I have come to say this is rather adorable.
Cat.
Oh my doodness. Give baby the treats.
Fuck it, take all the treats
Never seen a cat interlock it's toes.
r/catsstandingup
Oh good lord, that cat would weigh 20 pounds if he were mine.
Give the cat the whole bag!!!
One of the most underrated posts I've seen.
So cute
Awww~* Yeah, you can take them all <3
They can have my house!
I just don't know how anyone could say no to that face.
Aaaawwwwww! Precious!
Absolutely you can.
What sort of heartless cat servant could stop at but one treat when presented with this wonderful cat!?!?
Oh my gawd! This is sooooo cute!
Please sah, just a crust of bread
OMG! This is so cute it hurts me.
OMG!  This is so adorable.  Brilliant title/caption to this photo.  Thank you for sharing.
He has my heart.
I assume he’s named Oliver?
give him all the treats
I would give this cat everything I own.
Are his paw pads interlaced? Like human fingers? Dobby is too adorable!!!
How are you guys getting cats to do this? Mine are cute but they only sleep 😂
r/teefies
Ok, but only a *little* bit of salami, *just a taste* really.
Spare coochie mam?
Wow
Is for me? 👉👈
“I’m terms of money, we have no money”
If that does nor melt you, you are a stone and cold psychopath.
With that face of yours, you can have as much as you want :)
This is the cutest damn thing I’ve ever seen
You may have all the treats sweet kitty.
Mooooore!!!
The're so cute until your back is turned, then their REAL personality comes out!  ;-P
Peas sir, can I have some more?
Aweeeeeee so cuteeee
Give that kitty a pair of boots, a hat and sword!!!
Hehe, nice. Look like my kitty when she was younger (minus the begging). She just stares at me when she wants treats.
He deserves all the treats!
I'd rip my fucking heart out and hand it to this cat
I would give him all the treats.
Oh my gosh, so ADORABLE.
This is the most adorable thing I have ever seen
im a human, hooman
Oh my god get him boots and a sword yesterday
That cat needs a movie contract!
It's eyes are sharp
No puss n boots eyes...no treats...sorry kitty
Where the tail?
Is his name Oliver?
Cat.
Obliged.
Give the cat a treat please
Just give him all the treats, he deserves them all for  looking that good!
How can you ever say no to that face!!! So cuute
I'll probably give you extra more!
That cat better be named Oliver.

Someone get this cat a treat
Some more, Sir.
Cute
Give that baby a treat
Puss n boots
Omg...this made my night. We don’t deserve animals. Omg so so so cute
The toes are laced together!
I normally don’t give to beggars but this cat would get at least 5 treats
in the case of my cats, the situation is reversed. One day i might just have to leave my bed too.
Sweet little kitty!
GIVE HIM A TREAT!!
Throw the whole bag at it
Oh. My. Lord.
r/DisneyEyes
Meanwhile, the way my cat asks for treats is to aggressively bite my toes.
It does please me.
The is an Abyssinian and a Tabby at my house that run this scam too.
Who could say no???
Allll the treats!!
If this kitty's name isn't Oliver you must change it 🥺
r/miettediaries
My cat has a stomach issue so she'll never get treats 🥺
"Yayes"
This is adorable
A lie! 

Cats don't plead. At best the kit was being sarcastic and the ignorant slave didn't get it.
Adorable cats' kind gesture really need a treat.
Put a gun in it's paws pointing at the camera and it's a whole different picture
 A cat being polite and not just demanding food? 
I think we found the impostor
Just look at the little kitty. He/She is so cute.
Khajiit requests a transaction of perishable goods.
Kahjiit have wares if you have coin.
Khajit is very hungry sir.
My h art
Nice
LOOK AT HIM HES BEGGING
GIVE. HIM. THE. DAMN. TREAT
Why do I hear it British
GIVE THAT BABY ALL THE TREATS NOW!
Making an animal beg for food is a human perversion.  Doubly so when done for internet points.
OMG! This is so cute it hurts me.
*dumps the whole treat bucket*
Oh pweez pweety pweez! :3
Would give all the treats.
😍😍😍😍
Nice photo grab!
When someone tries to involve me in pyramid schemes.
r/catsstandingup
Mr Burns: Excellent
Yes, yes you do
Why is it that when I read this I thought of it in a British accent
Oh goodness the cuteness
My Preciousss!!!
Oh my! So many treats for you!♡♡
It is terrible what was done for this picture.  The cats hands were glued together,  and the cat was actually crying in pain.   Not an awww moment
👉👈is for me?
WHUUT?? MOOORE??
I think I'm going to melt. Soooo cute
You can have anything your furry little heart desires.
Could NOT own this cat. It would be the size of a small Rhino. Am sucker for cute begging.
GIVE IT TO HIM YOU MONSTER
Best cat picture of the year!
Im saving the image of this cat if you don’t mind it’s my favorite I almost want to hang it in the wall
Cat.
So cute
It looks so fake but its probably not
That was super cute
He’s glorious!
GIVE HIM ALL THE TREATS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This will be a meme template. Short lived maybe, but still, there’s a lot of potential here
My little asshole tired to run out the door today. Not once but twice. Ig he forgot I had to save him from a tree when I found him
Dobby is a free cat
I needed to see this sweet cat. Can't take anymore news on politics today.
No fuck off

Khajit wants some coins, will you be kind enough to spare?
Please sah may I have some moar?

I read this in a very specific British accent.
Gollum-Cat
:')
“is for me?”
NO. Fuck off
Do you have wares khajiit?
reminds me of my male cat he's injured :(
My cat always has such a face :)
Please sir, can I have some more?
Why did I read the title with English accent?
"What is in your hands?"
 My bf just said he would give him the whole bag "TAKE THEM, TAKE THEM ALL"
Khajiit swears on the merchants oath that he is not selling Skooma.
P O L I T E
Give him the entire packet.
Thank You for this. I showed it to my gf who was a bit angry on me and we both went awww
I could never say no to that face
OMG SO CUTE I WANT IT!!!
Why the fuck did I read the title in an english accent?
Except in my house its my dog
If Oliver twist was a cat.

Oh goodness, that cheeky glint in its eyes... I'd give the cat anything it wants!
This cannot be true!
Kind mister cat, I would give you ALL the treats
Oh yessssss
Want 80? Forget it just take the whole fucking packet
That cat would be morbidly obese if I owned it.  And I would be even more broke from buying treats.
For crying out loud.....
Of course because you are a beauty!
My dude looks like a Monster Hunter World Palico with that stance. Somebody Photoshop that in the other thread, I'm useless when it comes to PS. :(
OH MY GOD HE IS SO PRECIOUS
You have to give him 1000 treats tbh
“Would you like to learn more about our lord and savior Jesus?”
That is sweet!

Omg this just sent me to the moon! How could you ever say no?
This picture is absolutely adorable. The pose! The face!
I love him putting his paws together 🙏
This makes me so happy it tickles
Hilarious and cute ❤️
I have a squirrel that sits in my window begging like this. Now she has taught her children to beg in the same way—even coming through the cat door into the screened in porch, just to stare me down with clasped hands. No one can deny this level of cuteness. We may need a P.O. Box address to ship treats to you 😂
Why did I read this in an English accent?
This is the most cringeworthy title I have ever seen.
He's Back,   Again.... but this time...

He's the reincarnation of Al Jolson, doing Mammy, in Orange Face, three shows daily
Give him ALL the treats!
Oh, my goodness. Give the cat a treat. How cute!
So cute I'm about to cry ;-;
