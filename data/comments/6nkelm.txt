That was infinitely better than I ever expected 
This happened to me today when I woke up at noon to find my fiance had ordered us pizza for lunch.
As a former beagle owner,  I can attest to their insatiable appetite! They are bottomless pits. üòÇ 
If I ever cant find my dog in my house, I just drop a few pieces of food in her bowl. She comes running pretty much like this.
My beagle would actually recognize the sound of the drawer we kept his food in. They genuinely eat for fun.

What a goober. I love it. 
Straight for the jar instead of the bowl. Smart pup. Definitely Good Boy.
My 15 year old beagle still does this. You may have to put the food there and wait a minute because he is deaf, but he will smell it and pop up like you just shocked him with 1000 voltz of electricity. He still at his age is obsessed with food.
Beagles are just so obsessed with food. Ours once got to 6 frozen meatballs on the kitchen counter and ate them in less than 3 minutes (the time we were talking with the neighbors). He even broke a glass jar of Nutella and licked the pieces of glass clean (he had cuts in his tongue, didn't give a shit). God I miss that dog.
I can't believe there's a puppy that excited without a puddle of pee on that couch :)
I like beagles. 
Ayup. That's a beagle.
Man, this is as beagley as beagles can be! They're the most food motivated dogs on earth. I could have taught mine calculus if it meant he could eat. 
That's pretty good reaction time for a little feller.
"Why don't you put on a little make up"
Sweet sassafras, this was just the pure innocence I needed to see tonight.
Our beagle was just like this. He passed away last night but this put a smile on my face. Gonna miss my buddy. 
No wonder they use Beagles in airports, with senses like that!
0-100 Puppy REAL QUICK!
beagles are fucking vultures. they will eat anything and everything at once.
I'm just here for all the comments about how wrong everything in this video is!

That looks like me when I wake up late for work 
The dog may have been dreaming of this exact moment
Zzzzzzzz - OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY OH BOY om nom nom nom nom nom nom nom


MRW I wake up late for work 
So is this what they use to power Teslas? Puppies?
Hahaha so cute!! Had a schipperke that would react the same when he would hear the cupboard being opened, even if he was dead asleep 4 rooms away 
Yep...thats a beagle.
The amount of time it took to wake up and boop the food jar.. if only we could harness that energy somehow
This is live footage me when my brother opened a bag of chips when i was napping today
Yeah, that's cute now but it's gonna suck when he's fully grown.
*Wake me pup*

*Wake me pup inside*

*Can't wake pup*
I love how he skips the bowl and goes straight for the source
He wastes **NO** time getting up and getting that food. He's ready for it. He *lives* for it.

...ugh, I really miss having a puppy. I also miss having a big dog. Still got my dog, of course, and I love her, but sometimes you just want a clumsy trouble-maker again.

Must be what those peculiar parents feel like after their children have grown up.
Grab a brush and put a little make up!
Skip the bowl, go straight to the source! Clever beagle! üòç

My dachshund used to do this when he was little, it was cute until he started choking once. I got so scared I had to feed him by the spoonful for a while. 
Fucking Beagles.
Can somebody more talented than me edit this to System of a Down's _'Chop Suey'_
This is the cutest thing ever
Beagles = food motivated as fuck. Know that while owning one you either train it well or you keep your food in bear proof containers
Me when someone pops the lid off a jar of weed.
TIL people feed their dogs on the couch.
Onggggggggg cute
Bruh this little dude was gettin lit to that! I can only imagine him in the club and then a song comes on with food being poured into the bowl as the main sound in the song, this lil dude would start peakin
Me waking up on cheat day. 
Grab the brush and put a little makeup? 
LOL we just adopted a pupster; very similar reaction when feeding.  
so cute!
That's a good pupper in training to be a good doggo. 
Have a 9 year old beagle. Can confirm this one is to spec. 
my dad said "that's one hungry son of a bitch" 
me: don't assume gender 
Surprised there aren't any comment saying dogs behaving like this are seriously ill like every other dog post.
That would annoy the fuck out of me if my dog that while I tried to feed her. Might be cute now but won't be so cute when it's bigger.
He forgot to grab a brush put on a little make up
That's a beagle for you 
Total beagle.
this warms my heart 
GOTTA have my POPs!!
Ha ha ha ! Awww already has that beagle appetite :)

This was my fave thing to wake up to this morning!!!
this is the most amazing dog gif ive come across
This is great - puppy goes from sleep mode to high performance mode in an instant.  
This is exactly like teenage sons when they hear a microwave going in the kitchen.
MRW when the waiter says "Ok, you can help yourself to the buffet"
Beagles are one of the most food motivated creatures ever!
beagle very cute 
Aww
Pro tip: never get between a beagle and food. Just don't do it.
What the hell are you feeding your puppy on the couch for 
While this may be cute and all, I dont think this is teaching the puppy good habits when you put the bowl on the couch to feed her. Allowing this behavior just teaches the dog to eat wherever, and then owners would complain about bad behavior later on. A routine of eating in the kitchen at a specific time keeps the dog disciplined about its eating habits. 

Edit: source: we own a beagle
You wanted to!
My cat was sleeping in the basement. I was upstairs opening a can of tuna. I wasn't even finished opening it before I saw him at my feet. 
I squelled lol 
This wins the internet. All of it.
99% like this. The other 1% can royally go fuck themselves.
That's some Pavlovian shit right there. 
Grab a brush and put a little (makeup) 
That's me after I smoke some good weed.  
He didn't grab a brush or put on a little make up. I'm disappointed...

Now thats a Jackie Chan power nap.
WHY DONT YOU PUT ON A LITTLE MAKE UP?!
Is it bad that his reaction scared the shit out of me?
Goddamn brother.

He lives for this shit.
It's like a dream come true. 
Love this so much. 
What a dog.
and this is why i love dogs
*...run for your life with me?*
aww
Uhh.. feed your puppy as much as they can handle...
What a fantastic way to wake up.
Wow dat tummy tho
Holy shit that dog is a zombie

What a cute dog!
I remember once being excited to wake up. Oh how that feels so long ago. 
Wish I loved anyrhing that much. 
Awww cute beagle üòçüíï. I react the same way when my mom says food is ready üòÇüòÇ
Gimme Dat!
Meanwhile I can't get my dog to eat his food unless I stand there and say "EAT"
That's a hungry little man
nice dog

DO GIB IMMEDIATE!
This is a treeing walker. Its not a beagle.
Shockingly saw this on fb first.
My beagle once ate my sisters starfish intended for a biology project, then had lethal gas the next day
Pavlov effect
That.....that made my drunken night. Thank you and bless that adorable puppers
As a psych student all I thought was, Pavlov! Wait a second...
Need more
Man, I wish I was as excited about anything as much as that pup is for kibble.
Grab a brush and put a little make up!
I need to try this brand of breakfast cereal
Jackpot!!!! 
At first I really thought the mason jar was filled will cannabis
I wasn't expecting such an extreme reaction ..I literally lol'ed
Omg this is too cute!
LOL yep, that's a puppy for ya.
Looks sped up to me...
why do beagles eat like they have been starved for a week? The two i had as a kid would eat like it was the last time they were ever going to be fed.
Don't know your giving that dog, but I think I want to try it.
Chop suey ! 
I thought that was weed for a minute 
Cuteness overload. Definitely the most adorable thing I've seen on the internet today 
Haha this is me when I wake up in the morning
Can't wake up!

Wake me up inside!
Meanwhile my dog wont touch her food until you are out of sight
Yep, that's a beagle all right.
This dogs on nos
He was as dead as zombie whilst his awakening, until he tiredly and stupidly sprinted full speed of the couch.
That is the most adorable thing I have seen for a while. 
Hehe beagles will eat themselves to death, given the chance
Amazing 
The 2018 Beagles can go from REM sleep to full chow in 1.43 seconds.  They don't handle as well as older models, but their acceleration cannot be matched.  
I love my beagles. They're sometimes called a dumb breed but in my experience they're just stubborn and absolutely set on what they will and will not be doing. 
I'm keeping notifications on, on purpose, but this one really scared me.
Plz stop reddit
I just got triggered that Reddit notifications dissed me
Yep, Beagle. 
i woke up to this.
The notification woke me up 
Awww, that¬¥s so cute. My favorite kind of dog 4 ever.
This needs a background music.
Nibbles and coke!
Don't tell me what to do Reddit notifications
Cute. :)
I only wake up like that when I missed my alarm and am running late for work.

Look at the puppybelly on that chunkpuppy! He ain't missing no meals but he's acting like he's never been fed.
look at his little belly
Nice sleeping pet that are awesome
Jesus. I never seen a dog so hungry for food.
U woke the beast lol i love my beagle..laziest dog on earth till its food time
Oh goodness. How darling! Damn I love dogs.
Go from zero to kibble real quick. 
wanted to see that tail wagging near the end so bad 
Beagle puppies!! They're the best thing ever
it is a voracious dogüòÇ
Lol holy $hit. I love dogs.
I love her healthy little round belly! Such a good girl! ‚ô°
rofl - I expected a reaction but not diving head first into the jar
'Pretend to be sleeping so human is doing the stupid food thing'
My beagle is exactly the same haha... 
This has me in my feels. My baby is 12 now, not quite the pupper she used to be. Today I gave her her favorite can food and she only took one bite, I think more to appease me because I kept begging her. I am not ready for this. 
#WhenFoodIsLife
Literally me when I wake up
Was he not fed for 3 days or something? 
Awww‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

I LOVE how he attacks the source. He knows he'll get more doing so

That little paw twitch as OP starts pouring the doggo biscuits. I need a beagle. 
This is why you get a dog. 
oh god that little fat pupper belly on him!
OMG. I cant <3
/u/pumpkinloon loooooook. 
I miss my beagle so much. I work with dogs for a living and have never seen a more food motivated breed than the beagle, which this gif sums up so perfectly. They are also the cutest puppies (in my opinion) I had my boy for a good 15 years üòä this brought back good memories of his puppyhood.
Is that a beagle?
This dog's values of food:sleep are all wrong. I LOVE pizza, but if you wake me up with a pizza at 5am, expect a punch. 
What a good pupper
Both of my beagles where like this when they where young, just wait for him/her to trip over their own ears
The visual representation of "that escalated quickly"!
Fucking adorable.
That pupper was probably dreaming about food anyway
good ol fake sleep a roni wait until they leave  never fails unless pizza is involved
Sooo cute
FOOD FOOD FOOD! This pupper is pretty much me.
Wow.. puppy is still used to having to compete with its siblings. He's a strong one I can tell!
What the hell is inside that crunchies?
Real quick üòÇ
Poor little bear! He's so food-motivated!

Bork Fren! U dun me the upwakes alrihgt 
I'm so glad my beagle baby isn't a weirdo. She's exactly like this when it comes to food and she's a tiny little thing. It's hilarious!
He has a positive relationship with his food
Dog:My tail will murder you. Stand clear of my food!
Grab a brush and put a little make up!
You'd think the dog hasn't eaten in years, meanwhile its just out of a food coma.
I'm picturing the pupper falling of the couch and jumping on right back up again. 
It's little fat belly when it's laying down! <3
Omg aaaaaaaaagh sooooooo cuuuuute
*steals puppy* MINE NOW *runs off laughing like a maniac*
My parents had a strawberry patch in my old sandbox when I was in high school. It was actually more than that, a small garden if you will.

The s n I f f e r b o y e ate all of the strawberries and some tomatoes I think.

Needless to say my dad was not pleased.

The other day I showed him the picture of the pineapple dad and he said yeah that could have been me forlornly.

Our h o w l e r b o y e turned his head toward our conversation from the beagle bed he was laying on, getting a closer look at my dads expression before slowly walking out of the room and down the hall to the other room where mom was reading.

I don't think she knows about the garden.

10/10 would beagle again. 
I think I found my spirit animal lol
Nice dogi
GRAB A BRUSH AND PUT ON A BIT OF MAKEUP!
Doggie was moving before he was even awake.
Thank you OP for making me smile.
This is what dog food ads should look like 
this is me whenever my bf opens a bag of cookies
My beagle managed to eat the floor. So I got that going for me.
Serious question: why do dogs always act like they're starving? Even well-fed ones. I suppose it's an evolutionary response, but their excitement for food never seems to abate, even when regularly fed.
(Wake up!)
Grab a brush and put a little (makeup!)
Hide the scars to fade away the (shakeup!)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable!
As a new puppy owner, why would you ever wake them?  It's the only moment of peace you get during the day.
r/unexpected 
what breed is this?  Obviously it's a beagle (LOOK AT THOSE EARS!) but if I had to guess, I would say this was a blue tick beagle pup?
Adorable and the owner is very lucky that puppy didn't pee all over the couch in all the excitement!
I wish I had this kind of motivation to instantly wake up 
Grab a brush and put on a little makeup!
My cats do the same thing... they can be anywhere in the house passed out and coming flying down the steps when the food hits the bowl.
Adorable 
My beagle used to do something similar. She was stubborn as all hell and would follow around my sister so much that sometimes my sister would fall over her. It was a pain in the ass just to wake her up but when there was food involved she was able to outmaneuver Evel Knievel
"Food? Food?! FOOD!"
üòÇ
Downright the cutest thing I've seen all day!!
This little pupper put such a smile on my face. Absolutely adorable.
Puppers got some fast target acquisition. 
R/fleching 

Thats a beagle for you. Food obsession 
HEART HEART
That dog literally tried to become one with the food jar.
I do the same thing when my girlfriend wakes me up to breakfast tacos
Totally off-topic, but I think we have the same couch. Ashley Furniture sectional?
Hilarious.
I turned up my volume for this and was disappointed  
food is good
Look at that fat little belly 
Mate he just gets his face right up in there
Haha how funny lol
Mood for food
Got!!!!! his wake up motivation. 
They say that when Pavlov rang his bell, the dogs went COMPLETELY BATSHIT INSANE.
Stop feeding the dog kibbles, look up the BARF diet OP.  A balanced Raw food diet is much healthier for the dog
Now give it some real food.
That's a beagle for you.
I love beagles 
"Alright, alright just keep calm and everything.... FOOD! *walk away* Damn it, I fell for it again but what the heck food." 
You feed him just once a week??...lol
Me when offered food after a long run
I have a Jack Russell and Beagle mix. 

The Beagle provides the food obsession. The Jack Russell is the source of infinite energy to go after said food, and more. Pure chaos.

I love her.
Smart dog. He initially goes for the source instead of the bowl.
ARCHIBALD JEFF! 
I have a beagle and he's a character and stubborn, but never has acted like this regarding food. He's chill other than his tennis ball fetching obsession.
HIDETHESCARSTOFADEAWAYTHESHAKEUP
Can confirm. Source: have a beagle. She's 6 now. 

My dogs (1 beagle and 1 cheweenie who acts like a beagle since he learned how to dog from the beagle)  know the sound of the treat jar opening. They come running into the kitchen a la Scooby doo. It's hilarious. 
Food has always been the best alarm clock for me too
I had that couch. That couch sucks
This reminds me of my childhood dog. "Caramel..." *Opens one eye halfway, slowly closes it again and goes back to sleepies.* "Wanna go for a walk?" *Jumps out of chair from sleeping position onto the floor in a fraction of a second.*
He's a beagle they live to eat
Classic beagle. Greedy AF.
My beagle when a puppy took half a sub from subway right off my lap. Plus has drank countless glasses of pop or juice. 
Someone needs to add text to this!
its almost like he was faking it
That's me when I'm dead
Feeding the dog on the couch is good.
Unfortunately, this teaches a dog to hoard food. I usually leave food out all the time, and my dog has learned not to swallow down everything at every feeding.
That's a beagle for you
this is how when student wake up when professor caught him sleeping
screw the bowl, go straight to the source...

Clever and very active
r/beagle invites you to join us!
Reminds me of my dog, we got her a year ago from the shelter and "she wasn't food motivated". Now she can be dead asleep, but if she hears you grab a bag of chips and here's them open she goes from sleeping to in your face waiting for a chip.
Grab a brush and put on a little makeup. 
Almost like my brother's youngest beagle. She'll eat any food available to her, including the older dog's food, and our dog's food if it's left out when they visit. He's had to train both of them to go sit in their crates when it's meal time (and we have to put our dog's food out of reach when the beagles aren't crated.)
Thats my cat, 100%
Grab a brush and put a little make-up!
Are you starving the dog to death?
Beagle confirmed
All this faster than most police make decisions and immediately after waking up at that.
Would the dog be starved before recording this?
That right there is the epitome of a sniffer dog.. Beagle = King sniffer... every time..
I wish I could feel that kind of excitement.
This is the best thing I've ever seen 
Soo cute... look at that tummy...
Our pug is pretty much the same. She always tries to get into our chihuahua's food bowl and she also eats like a pig.
He pops up at the sound of the first piece hitting the bowl holy crap he's a light sleeper.
XD

How often do you feed this dog, bruh, he woke up like he's never seen food for 30 million centuries.

This is how my cat is. He can be passed out and will hear me grab his bag of food! He runs to me the instant he hears it even if he's dead asleep and the proceeds to attack me until the food is in the bowl.
Im surprised he didn't pee a little. 
You starving this poor pup? 
I fucking love this dog and i've never loved anything
I love how he's so excited he runs past the bowl of food 
Awe, she has that little puppy belly. 
I don't know which is worse, puppy envy or karma envy.

He was faking it the whole time. He played you.
There is no limit to a puppers excitement. :) 
My puppy is so dead asleep she doesn't care if a treat is in her nose.

The only time she will wake up without her wanting to is if we call the cats name because she loves to terrorize it! Lol! 
Its very cute and all but its really important you teach your pup that he needs to reach a state of calm before eating while hes young so that you don't have problems during feeding later in his life. I learned this the hard way when our child hood dog bit a visitor that wandered too close during feeding time.
Doggo loves food!!
MRW the oven timer for the pizza rings
OwO So cute
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?
My first dog was a beagle, Molly, and she would do this even into old age. Those dogs live to eat. I once had a pack of chocolates and she tore through the plastic to get them. One time, we made cookie ornaments with glitter and hung them on the christmas tree. Guess who had glitter poop after that? Molly. If she thought it was food, she would eat it. She would do a reverse sneeze for a minute straight when we had meat for dinner (not so affectionately called going "meat crazy"). She was a fat lil thing with a tiny head. I miss that sweet doggo.
Pupper got spooked!
Congratulations. You've got a dog that will beg for food on the couch for the rest of it's life.
Better make sure they don't keep that food aggression into adulthood. Just sayin.
Cute but what a bad habit to teach a dog lol
Do you want ants? 
This is how you get ants in your couch. 
And that's how i eat ass
I was so grossed out they feed their dog on the couch the cuteness escaped the moment.

He is so hungry
The poor puppy was starving... that person is so mean!
He was hungry as shit
My old dog ain't to good at chasing possum tru the woods. He never does a thing he should. He just sleeps an eat his fud. Singing go flash go. But he just stretched and yawned. Singing go flash go. But he just lay on the lawn. Scratching flees.
Why don't you put on a little makeup?!?!
This is very cute, but don't feed your pets on the couch. It's very important to have a specific and consistent feeding area and to teach them that food should not be expected elsewhere. I know in the case of beagles it's pretty much a moot point, but other dogs can be trained more easily.
Source?
Get that dog a slow feeder or a tennis ball.
Anyone else wonder at first why the owner was shaking a jar of weed at their puppy?
Stupid Beagles...
IVE FIGURED OUT THE TRUTH all of r/aww 's content is just for sociopathic animal owners to mistreat their animal to make them act out overdramatic scenes that the animal normally wouldnt do covering up anything suspicious in tight camera angles and uploading it hoping to hit front page and trending Youtube to fill the only thing that drives them which is abusing animals infront of thousands because abusing one animal for your own sake wasnt enough or even if you used to take your pitbull out in to the middle of the woods and tie it to a tree and beat the shit out of it with your girlfriend it still wasnt enough im looking at YOUUU r/aww..
