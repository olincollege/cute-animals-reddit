This may be your last day alive
I’ve never seen a cat so angry in my life XD
These faces crack me up
His fur is getting so messed up. He’s going to have to groom for at least an hour after this. Outrageous.
I don’t think pumpkin hates the Windy beach. I think pumpkin hates you
I never knew a cat could look like Gollum until I saw the photo on the bottom right.

Edit: 
golem —> Gollum (whomp-whomp)
> This place is everything I hate! Why did you bring me here??!!
r/scrungycats
He looks like one of those very angry cartoon cats. Lmao
Anakin the cat
Pumpkin is not fucking happy
Never, ever, have I been to the beach and thought, man my cat would love this. Not even once.
Who the fuck takes a cat to the beach
ITS WIMDY
Pumpkin might have sand in eyes,nose, ear and maybe mouth.
I don't like sand.

It's course, rough and irritating.

And it gets everywhere.
Cat looks like voldemorts face on the back of professor quirrells head in the first harry potter movie
Why do I want to kiss him right on his mad face?
Pumpkin is adorable!
Why do people take cats anywhere
Why do this?
r/teefies
I feel bad for Pumpkin
Am I missing something here or this is just karma farming from a seriously uncomfortable cat? Doesn't seem like aww at all.
Stop annoying and scaring your cat
God most of these comments, please don’t ever have cats. Please just don’t. Just don’t. It’s not fun to make them this angry, it’s not cute to see them this angry, this is how you break an animal’s trust, convince it you’re a threat, and get attacked “for no reason” and end up putting an innocent pet down for your own stupid behavior.
That's not "awww", it's "poor kitty has a selfish owner who drags him to inappropriate places".
Okay, but why do you bring a cat to the beach?
I for one cannot wait for Pumpkin to become the meme he was destined to.
Release me at last hooman!
"I would never take you to a giant sewer, why would you bring me to a giant litter box?" -Pumpkin Oct.2020
Yay. Let's piss off our pets for likes on reddit. I hate this sort of shit.
As if the fuck-you-i-wanna-go-home face isn't enough. Cats remember stuff man.
Cutie patootie
Angry Pumpkin is cute Pumpkin.
I can almost hear that cat growling
Why would you take your cat to the beach?!  The ocean  is quite loud and frequently scares pets.  I guess you needed attention at your pet’s expense.
Why would anyone take a cat to the beach? That's just weird to me.
I didn't feel aww when I looked at Pumpkin's angry face.
Why woukd you take a cat to the beach? Cats aren't dogs.
I'm with him.  Windy, cold beaches are about as appealing as nipple paper cuts.  I'm looking at you northern California.
Why does he need to be on the beach?
Get him home, please!)
I need this cat in my life.
Nope.
Looks like Tigress and Tai Lung had a kid
ANGERY
Very angry kitty. I’d be very scared if I was you
That face is priceless!
Bottom left photo is wishing to scratch out eyeballs!!
A beach might be the worst place for a cat
I know some people that took their cat to the park, it got loose, and they never saw it again.  I get why this is posted here, but I hope that the owners were at least careful.....doesn't really look like it tbh.
Poor kitty probably got sand in his eye.
"WHY>THE>HELL>DID>YOU>BRING>ME>HERE?"
u/Squishydafishy
Why is there a cat at a beach?
I'm printing this out and putting it on my front door
This is funny and all but cats' whiskers are pretty sensitive and this might be making the cat actually uncomfortable.
He seems very likely to be mad at you and not at the wind. Alsp this is nkt r/aww material.
Op say your prayers
Nanny Ogg's cat
Are cats being brought to the beach these days ? What a time to be alive.
Filthy Hobitses!!!
Perhaps it's the **vast expanse of horrible wet water** that has the cat so pissed off
purposely  fucking with animals isn't "aww"
Please don't take cats to beaches. They really don't like it. It's not nice to stress out your cat to make reddit posts.
Seems kinda like a dick move on your part.
r/stoptouchingme needs more love
That’s a chonky boi
umm
he’s so pissed he took his ears off like a girl takes off her earrings before it bout to pop off.
It’s me, I’m pumpkin
Wow...thats en evil looking cat!
I literally LOVE his name!! 🎃🎃🎃
Ooooooh booooy. He aaaaaangyyyyyy
Pumpkin gonna fuck you up
I would die for Pumpkin
Why are you holding a cat on a windy beach.
yeah maybe stop forcing yourself to pick it up
Poor cat is trying to keep blowing sand out of his nose & eyes... Get some PPE to your cat.
I see Webster’s definition of a “sour puss.”
Pumpkin gonna bite your ass for the lack of respect.
Pumpkin looks PISSED off.
I clicked this expecting photos of an actual pumpkin..

I'm not a smart man..
No you just farted
IT WIMDY

Grumpkin
Pumpkin wants to know why you brought him/her to the big wet litterbox.    

DO NOT LIKE.
I can’t stop
Laughing I’m sorry!!!
Aww, loved this past!! He looks like a grumpy human in the bottom pic... Super funny!🤣🤣😂😂💓
Pic no. 3 - Pumpkin is showing you his middle finger!!!   🥺
“Hey Diego”

“Fuck off, Sid”
Kung fu panda tiger?
That nose wrinkle though
That is the angriest kitty I have seen in quite some time.
I wonder if it hurts its ears? Wind buffets your ear drum I think and causes pain
Does your cat actually enjoy the beach on a less windy day? I can't actually imagine my cat doing that, and he's pretty laid back.
Looks like Pumpkin hates you
I relate to that last pic in a spiritual level
I’m pretty sure that cat is actually and literally saying Fuck You
Not so much r/aww as r/awwfuck.
I see Pumpkin and I immediately think “Bucky” from Get Fuzzy!
Does he have a medical issue? Like grumpy cat?

I have never seen my cat doing a face like that.
Ok so why did you bring him/her
Wow, pumpkin really hates windy beach!
Pumpkin about to "beach" slap you...coincidently that's our cat's name too!
Oh Lawd, I done witnessed the birth of the next cat for meme's.
OP, if I was you, I wouldn't fall asleep around Pumpkin anytime soon. LOL.
That first pic has me wheezing.
I love his little face!! hahaha he's SO mad! 

"This is the WORST. Take me HOME, Right MEOW!!!!"
You brought me to the litterbox of my dreams, but then it's wet.  All of it.  Wet!  And you're walking in it barefoot?  You know what makes sand wet, don't you?  No!  Oh, hell no!  You are \*not\* putting me down in that.  Carry me.  Carry me for the rest of your life, human.
it heckin WIMDY
Why has nobody asked why the hell is a cat on the beach? Every cat that I have ever owned has absolutely hated water! JS
Terrorizing your cat for fake internet points. Shame.
Why would you take a cat to the beach tho?
My first question is why do you bring your cat to the beach
What were you thinking, taking a cat to the beach??
I gave you my first and only award
fun fact: he's probably not angry!  (okay, he's a cat, so he probably IS, but that's not the reason for the facial expression).  Tigers and cats do this to close of their nasal passages when swimming.  he's probably trying to keep sand out of his nose...
1. Why? 
2. What happens if Pumpkin squirms out of your hands successfully and runs away?  Seems pretty irresponsible of you as a cat owner, tbh.
Aw, looking slightly cheesed there :)
Who farted?
Pumpkin is wise and has good taste.
Why are you taking your cat to the beach if it clearly doesn't like it
Lmao I love this
Oh wow I think that is the loudest I have ever laughed at Reddit. Absolutely brilliant. Thank you for sharing!
The kitty is unhappy. 

I repeat **The Kitty is unhappy!**

Crash positions everyone!
Why is a cat at a beach in the first place?!
Leave your cat at home, it's a cat.
ANGORY
That cat looks like the big cat chasing the human down the mountain!   Super pissed !
He may hate the windy beach but I love that scrunchy face!!!
I want to bring my cats to the beach so badly but I don't trust that they won't escape from their harnesses.
He looks like he’s winding up to say the word ‘fuck’ dramatically 😂
Gollum in cat form
I love you Pumpkin 🎃
Pumpkin looks like he hates everything.
I saw this on Gallowboob's twitter yesterday. Here it is front page next day. Truly, he was the master.
Probably the sand getting in its eyes and nose from the air...
More like Grumpkin hates windy beach
Angry kitteh
"WHY DID YOU BRING ME TO THIS GIANT LITTER BOX?!"
Why would someone take a cat to the beach?
This is awful.  Not even Halloween and already pictures of sandy claws.
Meaner than Church in Pet Semetary!
This genuinely made me laugh out loud! I love Pumpkin.
Pumpkin - you have the BEST facial expressions.
I..... love him so much
What an angry little lion
That cat must be a fan of Anakin.
I love pumpkin
The last photo! LMAO
Yes but we love Pumpkin

Pumpkin kind of looks like a feline Chuckie.

I had a kitty named pumpkin growing up.  He was a solid black cat we found as a stray kitten on Halloween.
The more I look at this the better it gets 😂
Pumpkin hates more than the wind....
My heart

Pumpkin looks like golem from lotr in that last picture.
**It fucken WIMDY**
Wow this is incredible
Holy shit... And I thought my cat was scary when it got mad... This one is straight up metal...

Reminded me of Kreacher from Harry Potter
Oooh he *mad*!
My cat gets so annoyed when I take her to the water right by our house, she hates the sound but if it’s just calm she still hates how far she is from the house so we walk back home very shortly after  lol
Love your kitty but it's my Monday vibe!
Last photo the cat looks like a female lion
He looks like the sabertooth from Ice Age.
He looks like when Puss from Shrek got angry.
Awww makes me want to cuddle pumpkin more.
Good luck at 2am tonight.
All you people leaving comments to OP about his cat as if this isn’t just a repost lol
Lol the expression
ahahah that's amazing
EVERYONE hates windy beach... Pumpkin can just express what we are all feeling (can we just go home and reddit?)
Oh my
That's not a cat, that's a flerken!
That cat is literally me when I have to take pictures
I hope master Shifu taught you the Skadoosh.

Pumpkin remembers. Pumpkin is now planning an attack on you.
Hah!

/r/scrungycats
The look of pure disgust and anger. Perfect.
Tai Lung we meet again!

She looks so creepy
My educated guess is Pumpkin hates a lot of things.
I'm saving this and using for a reaction image.
lol your cat is my spirit animal. This is my face when we all go out and I come home with 15 mosquito bites and everyone else who has 1 thinks I'm just exaggerating
Its fucken WIMDY!
This is my face every time I have to wake up early
Me too, bud. Me too.
No talk me im angy
Ahh yes, the beach. The true ancestral habitat of the feline.
MRW I hear Christian Rock.
And a normal face comparison?
That last one looks like a Disney villain
What a cat.
Pumpkin looks pissed. You’re gonna get eaten.
Looks like the Gorgonite from Small Soldiers
This is just a repost of that cougar following that hiker!!!
I bet he got some sand in an ear and thats when this happened.
Poor Pumpkin! Lol!
I found my spirit animal
Lol, priceless
Pumpkin is not amused.
"It fuckn windy!"
Adorable! I love that name! Guess what? My chickens name is pumpkin! 😂

Fumkin wimdy!
He looks like he’s spitting sand out his mouth in the first couple pictures. *phtooey*
Looks like archer from small soldier's
OMG I want that cat 😂😂
"The fuck? Is this sand my mouth???"
I’ve never seen a cat point with one digit before.
“Tonight, you.”
He's gone to the dark side... The sand was too much. To be fair it is course and rough.
The sand blew, and it latched

the wind blew with fury it matched

paw deadly, he angrily scratched

pic at the ready I giggled and watched
I think Pumpkin may be my soul mate.
I congratulate you on the first ever incidence of obtaining such a photo and living to tell the tale!  I think I may have to save that photo for use as a profile pic one of these days.  A part of me feels horrible about it, but I just can't stop laughing!  :-)
Rarrrrr
I love scrunchy-faced angry cats.
I love how the universal language of anger for most species is the snarl face.
😂🤣😂🤣omg that face🤣😂🤣
That knife hand tho
Pumpkin might hate you! Haha
is it because of the whiskers?
I wouldn't wanna fight that cat
I’ve never seen an angry blep before. It’s kind of amazing ngl
How did you even bring Pumpkin to the beach? I wish I could do that with my kitten but she's going to shat herself and run back home faster than Speedy Gonzales...

Also, Pumpkin has a deep range of emotions. Give him an Oscar 😂
Awww so grumpy and cute 🥰
I thought I knew what pure hatred looked like
Gollum x Puss n Boots
Reminds me of Diego from ice age as a kitten
This cat looks like Kretcher from Harry Potter.
Omg.. omg this is so cute yet feels so mean
This is what happens when Shrodingers cat was let out of the box
me too pumpkin. me too
So glad my dog never looks at me with obvious murderous intent.
Who takes a cat to the beach
Beautiful cat.
That’s my face when I wake up
This is the best thing I’ve seen today 😂
Nice to see my neighbor's cat out and about... I think. I mean the cat's name is pumpkin, I live near the ocean, my neighbor's cat is named pumpkin, same color, not sure about the attitude though.

Pumpkin knows where you sleep
Pumpkin is getting ready to whoop your ass
Christ, it's furious.
Water, sand, wind...what's to like?!?
Careful. Pumpkin knows where you sleep and appears hell bent on revenge.
The 2 panels on the left look like it could be the drake meme
How is this not a meme template yet?
That frown just makes me love this even more 😊
Probably thinks it’s one big litter box and has been trained to get in... do your business and get the heck out… LOL
This is definitely meme material
Pumpkin is so adorable.
Who's the little angry kitten?☺
"Kreacher does not like sunshine."
somebody's big mad.
Can we see more photos, please!
I, too, have an orange tabby named Pumpkin. He'd probably hate the beach as well since Gingers sunburn easily.
Finally a worthy opponent our battle will be legendary -that cat
A fucking mood
Angy
The last photo reminds me of Tai Lung from Kung Fu Panda
My face right after the weekend has passed:

Why this cat look like Tai Lung from the cinematic master piece Kung Fu Panda?
I am saving this post for a rainy day when I need a laugh. Or maybe a windy day...
I think Pumpkin is channeling an inner lion. Pumpkin is not best pleased. You have been warned.
I would be the one who would hug the angry kitty to comfort it.. then I would probably die.

He looks like "Billy The Butcher"
In the bottom right he looks like Diego from Ice Age
Cat looks like William Dafeo in that last pic.

I would do anything for pumpkin
So mad yet so cute. I don't think I've ever seen a cat with this expression before. Very unique.
So cats are not beach bunnies?

But cats normally like the big litter box!
Why are we still here? Just to suffer?

Ive never seen a cat more angry in my life and it is the cutest shit ever!
My wife's face when I tease her.
Change his name, that ain’t no pumpkin.
And people say you can’t read cats. They have the best facial expressions.  Adorably hilarious!
Omg his scrunched up nose!
Keep that cat away from younglings.

Officially the best cat pics of all time!
Favorite cat pics EVER! Truly legendary!
How can a creature looking so angry look so cute at the same time?
In United States, Pumpkin carves you!
This whole photo set says "Fuck around and find out"
That cat is my spirit animal.

There is nothing I hate more than the wind. I'd describe what I'd do if it were a living entity, but this is the wrong sub for torture.
I love the third pic. "YOU!!! You did this to me!!!!"
Get kitty some goggles to keep blowing sand out of her eyes...

The obviously doesn't help but she might have the stink face because the beach is like a massive kitty toilet!
This is awesome. I've been blathering to my GF for weeks saying how much I really want our boy to go to the beach. This is hilariously cute but does not discourage me lol.
I'd bring them to the beach everyday just to see that face.
Cute
