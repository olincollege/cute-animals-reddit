Was anyone else hoping the guy pretended to act startled for the sake of the pup’s enjoyment?
Omg how cute
#BOO! HAHAA I GOT YOU
Man I grew up with poodles... those things are so freaking smart its actually a little scary. 
Every time I visit my mom and my childhood dog (M 13), Noodle,  I always pass him little bites of food under the dinner table. I always have and that's why I'm his favourite. My mom hates it, so if I give him a bite and my mom looks, he stops chewing until she isnt looking anymore, then chews faster.
Wow!  My cat does this too, and she think she's SOOO clever lol. Love it when animals do this!
Wtf this is so cute I didn't know dogs pranked people
We underestimate the intelligence dogs and other animals

That little fuzzpot made a plan & executed it :D

Stuff like this is always so cool to me.  Animals acting like people.  I can't remember the name but there is a subreddit dedicated to animals acting like humans, so damn cool.
Dog:  GOT YOU, SUCKA!
Gotta love a dog with a sense of humor.
That was so sweet the way he patiently planned that, and the little pounce was so playful and considerate even. Adorable.
That’s a brilliant dog!
I'm amazed by this.  I've never seen a dog do this shit.
...oh, here he comes - am Much excite!

We had a Labrador when I was a teenager who loved practical jokes. I remember peering into a ditch that I thought she was trapped in yelling her name only for her to walk up beside me and casually look in it with me.
Adorable!!!
Where are the baseboards?
One of my cats used to hide behind the wall when I came home and jump me, sometimes he would reach around the wall and smack me in the face with his paw while sitting on top of the fridge
😍
Omg that little tap! So cute!
r/likeus for sure

Love this.
I had a cat that used to do this. I'd breathe heavily so he knew I was coming and he'd hide around the corner until I got close and then pop out. It was a fun game we played. 

I miss that cat.
Today's not over but this is the best thing I will see today
/r/petthedamndog
I pounce you
Tag, you're it!
That guy really doesn't enjoy stairs.
Now get down there and show it love bro! You just left that dog confused as to whether you liked it or not and it's never gonna play with you ever again.
Thats so much bling on his ear! No wonder he was walking slow.
This is the only kind of prank channel we should have: the one where puppers try to prank their owners and are really cute in doing so

That guy looks like a tired Elon Musk!

What is that?looks like a little bear
let me walk up these stairs like an old person
Lol I had a cat who would do this. Our apartment was essentially one long hallway that broke off into different rooms. He would hide out in the dining room which separated the living room from the kitchen and jump out as you'd walk through.
My cat does this all the time and sometimes she succeeds and we both jump in shock lol
Aaaw it looked so exited after the spook.
That little prankster has a cute afro!
FUCKING PET IT
I was waiting fpr that guy to fall back down the stairs
R/scriptedpuppygifs
"Ssshhh.... Here he comes! Here he comes!"
Wow what a fluff
My cat does this all the time, he hides behind the curtains and waits for someone to go through and scares them. He loves to jump scare and he loves the reactions he gets from it.
The little stance at the end is priceless
I don’t understand how animals understand this kind of stuff, like scaring someone for fun.  dey people.
The other dog is like, "ok he's coming, get in position!". <Smiles at camera>
Pet the damn dog, Jon Snow!
Aww the way he looks up to see if he startled his owner ❤️❤️
Isn't it illegal  not pet that 🐕?
r/scriptedpuppergifs
That is clearly a monkey.
My poodle is even too lazy to fetch
I had somewhat the same with a cat. Not sure if this cat wanted to jump me, get petted or didnt saw me. But while i was running through the street suddenly he jumped in front of me while I almost gave him a kick. It got hit but could hold back lol. He ran away immediatly :P
poodle does bamboozle
Was that dog raised by cats?
„It‘s just a prank bro“
This is what my cat does to me, all the dang time, behind every corner in the house.

Holy shit that dude walks slow af
That awkward stretch
That might be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
Proof positive that dogs can in fact look up
It's a cat in disguise, I'd watch him very carefully.
So intelligent. It knows to stay properly hidden. Kids are incapable of that. They always take a peak.
Clever girl...
It’s so fluffy I’m gonna die

I can almost hear the little girlish giggles from the puppies.
Excuse me?! He didn't even PET him??
Dogs are so awesome
That’s clearly a cat. You can tell by the behavior.
Is this pup secretly a cat? My cat does this to me every time I come up from the basement.
It's trained.

My cat does this often. But then she proceeds to run away, indicating she wants to play the catching game. The other time she does this is when we leave her and go out and shes mad

So cute!
My cat does this every time I turn the corner from the bathroom hallway. Every time. If I flush the toilet she hears it and gets in position. She thinks I don't see it coming.
Dawwwww
Dogs can’t look up.
This really made my day. Thank you!
OMG! I do it exakt the same way, but i am sure that I am not cute like him😅
Brilliant dog !

Freakin adorable
what kind of dog is that?
Omg....that Poodle 'fro is too much.
Someone with more legitimate insight into dog psyche than me just because I am really interested in a scientific explanation rather than "Of course he can he is adorbs", do dogs get the concept of startling someone out of fun like humans do?
Our Yorkshire used to do that with my mom, as it got old and blind it would still so it(poorly) and my mom would pretend to be startled

/r/animalsprankinghumans
AHHHHHH💕💕💕💕💕💕💕
Pet that damn dog right fricking now
All y'all asking about what the pup's breed is, it's a poodle. They're very smart dogs.
So no one is wondering why it was being filmed? Or why both dogs ran away when he came up, as if trained to do so?
A little bummed the dude didn’t play along and act spooked
The lean after the scare! "Did I get you?! Did I?! I knew it..."
What kind of dogs are those and why do I see them with Asian owners all the time
That man could have atleast shown some more excitement for that good boy
All I can see is Bob Ross!!

Staged. Look at how deliberately he slows his step right before the pounce.

I double tapped but not to like to fast forward
For a moment after surprising he was like

What kind of heartless savage doesn’t reach down and give that pupper some love?!?!
My cat used to do that to me when I was a kitten.  So cute!  I wish she would still do that.
“Flip Flops and Black Socks, really?”
Downvote me if you want but if it's something animals/people never do and the people in it are East Asian, it's scripted. They have this culture of scripted viral videos over there that Americans assume are like these one in a million chance type things where someone *just happened* to be filming it, and *just happened* to be at a perfect angle
Thats behaviour thats taught to the pup, for tiktok chinese fame i guess
"I bamboozle you hooman"
I’m going out on a whim here and saying this dog has been trained to do this. The whole set up is obviously staged , and dogs just don’t do jokes
[removed]
Aside from this being one of those staged Asian videos, a reason it is being filmed is this dog did it before so the owner's friend (sibling, girlfriend, spouse, whoever) decided to film it the next time it happened.
