you better get jasper some special treats! I'm sure he loves playing with you :)
Jasper is the best medicine ☺️
Jasper is the goodest boi
Lol, my neighbor's cat, Jasper...aka Jazz paws...aka JP, thinks he's moving in. Your JP looks like a sweetheart.
I went through a crippling major depression episode a few years ago.  During that time I literally didn't get out of bed for 21 hours a day for the majority of the days during a 1 1/2 year period.  The toll that takes on your body can't be described. Anyway what finally helped me get back on my feet was my dog.  My wife brought home a puppy and I decided I wanted to train him and take him for walks.  15 minute walks in daylight were really hard for me but I did it.  My dog basically rehabilitated me.
oh, hey! it's *You*, my favorite friend!

hang on - i'll get a toy!

i Love the time we get to spend -

i'll share what i enjoy!!

don't leave - you'll see, i'm gonna RUN

*sometimes you find a special friend,*

*who can't stay for too long...*

*but they need All the time you spend*

*with them to keep them strong*

*so be like Jasper, everyday*

*n stay with them awhile*

*just stop, n sit, n maybe play*

*n leave them*

*with a smile*

❤️
Let's all be Jasper on this blessed day.
I can't be like Jasper. I can barely fit *one* RC truck in my mouth let alone three.
My dog had one just like that.  We called it his yucky ducky because no matter how much we washed it, he always got dirt and slobber all over it.
This is the cutest thing ever 🥰🥰
I had a Golden as a kid and his favorite toy was a duck. A little terrier came to the edge of our yard one summer day and was yapping at him. He ran away and returned to defend himself with his toy duck in mouth.
Funny thing about my dog, his first toy was a very similar duck. We called it his duck, "go get your duck", "where is your duck", now he is 5 years old and all of his toys are still referred to as his "ducks" and I wouldn't have it any other way.
My name is Jasper and I swear I only meet cats and dogs named Jasper.
~~C~~Jasper the friendly ~~ghost~~ dog
Dogs are truly angels without wings. Not sure I’d still be here today without my pupper.
“Bruh, check this shit out”
*RUNS back inside her apartment and fetches you her tablet and a stick of butter
[My dog is also named Jasper](https://imgur.com/a/gM9qjsr)
My neighbor's golden was always out by himself in the backyard. One day he discovered a hole in the bottom of the fence an he would nudge his tennis ball under it and then peek at me. I would throw it back into his yard and he would run and retrieve it and nudge it back under the fence to me over and over again. He was all alone but still found a way to play with someone.
Where do you live? I have a stick, rubber duckie, yoyo and a bayblade. I'll bring them right over.
A fantastic doggo with a great duck!.................. Just how popular are those ducks though? My girl has the exact same, so does my neighbors dog and my friends dog, also multiple other dogs that I know.
Be like Jasper, yes, but also be like you, OP. I also have a hard time with mobility as well, due to a disability and some chronic pain. Clearly you’re a good human because Jasper loves you, and Jasper is a very good judge of character. Also, sharing Jasper with all of us made tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of people smile today. That’s a good deed. 

We are all so incredibly lucky to be alive and have the chance to appreciate each other and our animal friends and all the small delights and wonders of life here on Earth.
My name is Jasper

I bring my duck

I bring him cause he gives me luck

I want to share my luck with you

In return, I'd like a hug/scritch or two.
My dog has the same name lol nice
Jasper should be the poster dog for a new "Do into others" movement. Just think of how great the world would be if even 50% started treating each other of the way Jasper does OP.
Looks like a Golden Retriever. Don't think they're dogs. They're really nice small people in dog suits :)
Dogs are way better than 99% of people. I'm glad he can be with you during this time, you lighten up his world just as much as he lights yours up I bet.
That looks like a toy I would also play with
I want to be like Jasper; being positive and uplifts people.

Japer his impact. His mind. Be like Jasper.
So sweet. I love him alweddy
LOOK AT HIS TAIL
I love you, Jasper
Heckin good boye does a fren some lovin' an  some healin' 😭
Thanks man I appreciate it
We do not deserve dogs. Makes me miss mine right now.
I had a golden retriever named Jasper too when I was a kid. They truley are the most loving dogs ever. Miss you buddy :(
Pet him for me.
What’s with good boys and stuff ducks?
Goldie’s are the best dogs, and Jasper is clearly the best Goldie.
Hope you can get better soon!
How sweet :) he wants you to feel better!
so cute Jasper! wish you and Jasper a happy sunday :)
Khajiit has toys if you have scritches and treats.
I love jasper. And you. xD
I had a cat named Jasper. The name means ‘hidden treasure ‘. You found yours!
Jasper just wanted you to be happy... Awww such a good boi
My dog always brings her favorite toys when she sees her favorite people.  Big compliment!
That's a good boy right there. A very good boy!
Goodest Doggo
We need more Jaspers in our world! Dogs are so intuitive and loving, clearly Jasper sees that you are a good person!  Sorry for your health issues.
I also have a Golden named Jasper, with his twin brother Barley :)  they are the sweetest babies
I love him!
My daughter in law surprise rehomed a Golden Retriever to us.  She’s the most intuitive dog I’ve ever run across, if she had opposable thumbs, she’d rule the world.  If she has the slightest idea about what you want from her, she’ll do it.
Okay. I admit it. I'm crying. Blessed be Jasper!
Jasper is a very good boy
Picture of a dog with toy.
Hi everyone just a reminder to please plant trees, dont use plastic anymore and try cleaning beaches if u have the chance or our world is gonna start going extinct by 2050 which would really really suck and obviously this good boi wouldnt have a good home anymore because itll be so hot
Jasper the clasper.
Omg, our lil girl has the same duck!!!
It’s one of her favorites.   
Bet ya it’s one of Jaspers favorites also.  
He must like ya.  Good doggie neighbors.    :)
I wish this picture was a gif because you know that tail is wagging like crazy and we could all use a big tail wag these days!
My dogs have that toy. They honestly love it so much ha
Jasper is the real GOAT
What a good dog.
I swear I've seen this exact picture a dozen times on this sub.
Oh, he is the goodest! ❤ Every golden I have ever met has the sweetest, friendliest personality.
That's why dogs are the best friends of human. He take care about you.
Nice duck jasper!
Is he dutch? I am and I presume jasper is a Dutch name.
This is awesome!! And not even made up or stolen like the rest of reddit.
Jasper is coolest dog, reward him with a special treat ok?
Dogs are the best.
Goldens are the best. When mine was younger she would always great me with a toy. My basset hound does it now. No take only show!
What a creature, bless him ❤️
I love jasper.
He’s a good guy.
That is so sweet. Good neighbor relation is awesome.
Sooooo Cute!!!
What a good pupper!
Jasper? Jasper! Where is that ~~no good cat~~ all good dog?
We really dont deserve dogs

 Hope you have a excellent day!
I love how you can tell he's excited because his tail is just a blur 


What a sweetie
That's thoughtful of him, sweet Jasper.
Awww, I love Jasper.
That is one nice dog
Aww dogs are the best. What a sweet doggo.
> Be like Jasper.

You want me to bring you toys and sticks in my mouth?

That’s awesome. Dogs showing you their toys is a big deal.
My name is Jasper too!  Im honored
My dog is also named Jasper!
Nice dog
Fuckin adorable!@
The goodest of boys!!!
We have that same duck toy. Our girl is very proud of it also
A cat will and can never do this.

Checkmate cat lovers. Dogs are forever the superior pet. Eternal love and affection.
All the best for you and your health you will get better☯️dogs are the best Jasper is a good mate to have he makes me smile all the best for you.
Such a good boi
What a good boi
If you are sick or hurt my mom's dog brings you toys. It's trying to help.
Wow so cuty~~~~ 🥰🥰🥰
That is awesome! My dog brings me toys when he gets excited I am home. What a sweet pupper you have looking out for you!
We don't deserve them.
Awwww he is soooooo cute 😍😫
Jasper is good boy
I love Jasper
Good boy!
The angle of this photo makes it look like Jasper is a Golden on Dachshund legs.  Which would be super cute.
we just dont deserve dogs.

i mean.. his toys are his favorite things, the stuff he enjoys the most. and he (eagerly!) shares them with a lonely neighbor.. cos he assume those toys can make the neighbor happy just like they make him happy.

when we ever like that? eagerly share things with sole intention to make others happy? 

thanks Jasper. a dog that teaches us how to be a better human..
All the best dogs are called Jasper! My last dog was a Jasper and was also loving and toy focussed! I hope your neighbour's Jasper continues to make you happy and brighten your days 💙
I wanna be like Jasper
Adorable 😊
A good boi indeed ❤😘
hey that’s the same toy my puppy has
Good boy Jasper!
Kids and dogs share their toys because it makes them happy, who they share them with will be happy too?
Sooooo precious 🥰
Seems like a good boi. I give 10/10 veri good boi
This made me smile so big it hurt. Stay well. Jasper will help.
Animals are amazing <3
"I showed you my duck, answer me"
Awww
This is amazing! My golden/husky mix has his "friends". They are stuffed animals I snag for him at goodwill(thrift store). He mostly gets sock monkeys when I can find them because they hold up well. But everytime I come home he has to run to find any of them he can before rushing to come see me. 

Here is a pic of my handsome boys!

  
 https://imgur.com/VkkT4m3.jpg
My dog has that same duck!  Although hers is in tatters.  She loves that thing.
My dog does this when we come home!
❤️❤️❤️
My 20 month old's name is Jasper, and he does the same type of thing.
Feel better OP ♥️
I want the tee shirt “Be like Jasper “
[deleted]
Aww! So sweet ❤
Breaking news, this just in: Jasper truly is the goodest boy. Details at 11.
Yo my dog has this exact same duck! A bit more well loved, but the same one lol
My dog has this duck. It's her favorite as well. I wonder why. When I wash it, it becomes a brand new duck and she loves it even more.
My neighbor's dog has that same duck toy. He carries it everywhere.
It must be a Jasper thing. My Jasper HAS to great everyone with a toy. He will run around like a crazy dog until he finds one (that he's hidden) before he can greet you. His favorite is his little orange ball. 🧡
r/animalsbeingbros
My names Jasper too and i love the comments.
We don’t deserve them.
Headscratchies!!
This dog could own you if it brought him more joy than being your friend...which it never will
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Goldens are wonderful dogs the best I have ever had
Cuttie thing
Good boi Jasper!
What a cutie.
I’m so happy Jasper brings you tots to brighten your day 😁

My girl Zoey, she gets to happy when I get home that she can’t stop wiggling her butt in excitement lol. She comes to me and then quickly runs off to find a toy, but sometimes she can’t find one so she brings her bone to me lol!

Edit: [This is Zoey ❤️](https://i.imgur.com/HEr4lbw_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium)
Bless you, Jasper.
He's precious!!! <3
#3toysandastick for jasper. Hip hip.. hip hip...  horray
I'm glad he's your neighbor dog
We're not good enough for them! What a beautiful boy! 💙 💙
I HAVE A GOLDEN NAMED JASPER!!! He also has a duck toy like that as well!
He adorable🐶
*sigh* Fine, I'll go buy a toy duck.
I have the same duck as that for my dog :)
Alright Jasper!!!

Who upvotes garbage like this?
I love woggies so much <3

Thats a mallard, Jim
Good dog! Look at that tail go.
I would die for jasper
Mans best friend, nuff said
At first I saw half a duck and two chicken nuggets...

Dogs being bros.
Wholesome Jasper
 He looks like the real life version of the dog from Up.
Jasper is the cutest.
this dog admire you better than the owner
That doesn’t look like a duck
This is wonderful. My partner has recently had an operation and been laid up. I work away a lot and our dog brings her different toys at different times and it really seems like there’s a method to his choices. All the best to you and Jasper!
My dog has the same fucking duck
Cute doggo
I like that duck too...
Jasper

Casper
Every time I come home my Jack who is a 4 year old boxer picks up something and brings it to me.  It could be anything- a toy, a couch cushion, a shoe, anything that’s handy.  I read somewhere that the dog who does that is telling you that they love you.  You must be Jasper’s special friend. 😀
Give him pets
Wouldn't it be great if we could all have neighbors who were happy to see us, you are truly blessed
What a great person
His expression is priceless.
Omg I get the same mallard toy for my dogs all the time.
I love the quiet dignity he's trying to show, which is doomed by the duck, for the picture.
Good Buoy ! ❤️
[removed]
is there a r/cute if so PUT IT UP! its adorable.
My dog had that same duck.
My baby has this same duck! He’s normally a toy assassin but he’s been really gentle and protective with his mutually-favorited toy.
It would have sounded better if you said "This is Jasper, my neighbor."
That poor duck 🥺🤣
I love you Jasper!
What did we do to deserve dogs? They are the best
Isn’t awesome how sometimes dogs just...know?
I had a good boy golden named Jasper just like that when I was a kid.
That’s my dog’s name! I thought it was original at first but apparently Jasper is quite a common name!
This is the best story I read today, thanks for sharing.
Aww, my Golden growing up had that exact type of duck. It was her favorite next to a plush train engine. Miss you Sparky ❤️
Maybe you should offer the owner to dog sit. Goldens are amazing loyal and social.  This gives her an opportunity to have someone to watch her dog if she is busy and gives you the ability to have some dog therapy
.
My name is also Jasper, that counts right?
[deleted]
You should post this in dogs with jobs
That's a model dog now.
What a sweet dog :)
Every day when I come home from work my pup greets me with frantic tail wagging and hugs at the door and then turns and sprints to find a toy to grab and bring to me and try to shove in my face. Definitely her way of showing love.
Nice
I want to give him a hug. Good boy!
Ni.in.k.i.k.i.k.i.k,i
Good boi.
Enjoy the pup! I hope you get your health back.
[deleted]
So cute
My dog has that same duck

Good boys rise up
Golden retrievers are too good for this world!❤️
Goldens love doing this.  Mine loves to carry my shoes around.  He never chews them, but I can rarely find both mates of a pair without some searching.   Also, I have a 2 year old now, and there's little use try's to explain to either who's toys are who's.
He’s beautiful!
Hi
Jasper loves you.  What a sweet boy!
We don’t deserve dogs
We love you Jasper
My spaniel does this. He HAS to go get a toy to show you
Somebody needs to send this dog a crate of those ducks.
Best of luck on your health problems, i hope all goes well, and i also hope jasper brings 4 toys and two sticks some day
So you want people to bring you stuff because you don’t leave the house?
Goldens are such wonderful creatures. Our Golden, Fred, came to us as a one eyed rescue when he was around 3.  He was a goof, plain and simple. One time he 'treed' himself on the kitchen table. We found him waiting for someone to rescue him and  show him how to get down. As a toddler, our grandson would sleep on him and he didn't move a muscle. And he loved everyone.

&#x200B;

We lost him a few weeks ago. Now we are waiting for his ashes to come home.

&#x200B;

God...I miss him so.
He must know you need cheered up.  What better way than to bring his favorite toys so you can enjoy them too.  A sweet way to show you he cares.
aww man i love so much golden retriver and this one is a cutie uwu
Could be my dog's twin. Especially with the toys.
/r/Incorgnito
I love Golden's so much. I grew up with one, and they always seem so happy and energetic all the time. They make my spirit smile :)
I have a golden retriever named Jasper too! He is the sweetest boy in the world. When we open the back door to let him in, he will run up to greet us with his entire body wiggling, then run back to his toy basket to bring as many toys possible as a gift. If we buy him a new toy, he will proudly parade it around and he needs to show it to everyone in the house before he can play with it. Jasper is also so therapeutic. He can tell when someone is feeling sad and will comfort them and stay next to them for hours. I think Jaspers are universally amazing boys.
Neighbor dogs are the best
Hands down animals are so much better than most people I know...

Hope you feel better soon, op
Heart warming story! We could take a lesson from Jasper!
Awwww buy Jasper some treats, what a lovely doggo 🥰
I love how this dog looks like he is 100% done with the photographer's bullshit.
This post made my heart so happy. Thank you for making my morning great Op and Jasper! ❤️
My cat has that same duck. It squeaks when you squeeze it.
My dogs have that exact duck toy but you wouldn't be able to tell. Theirs is slightly more "worn". Jasper is such a gourgeous good boy, dogs are so pure! 😍
My neighbors dog is the image of this doggo. Looks a little older but exactly the same. Comes out with toys and stuff too.
2 things
Jasper is the goodest of boyes and the way he is looking up into the camara is too adorable
He loves you!!! ❤❤😁😁
My girl gas that duck. It's one of her favorites
Handsome.
Jasper is a unit.
You are a very lucky person.
Picture of a golden retriever holding a duck chew toy.
What a lucky dog, he seems so happy and well. All the best to all of you.
i worked once in a phone repair shop, it was an awful job but what made it bearable for me was this GSD puppy who lived with a family across the street, i had a german shephard puppy once and he reminded me so much of her. one day i was on my way to work and i found him outside and played with him a bit and gave him pats, so he started showing up randomly until it became a regular visit and he'd bring me a toy eachtime :D it was great.
I love goldens.
i have a cat named that
He might legally be your neighbor's dog but, you are just one of his many humans.
I bet he wants you to want that duck but doesn’t want to give it to u:)
Love me some golden retrievers
I would try and get out more if I had a jasper
Jasper’s a good and happy pup. Glad he knows a true friend 💙🐶
The look in his eyes too like “I’m so adorable” 🥺
Some do, some don’t have spinal issues
Awww, what a sweet neighbor, Goldens are so special. Hope you're feeling better and on the mend
Hey friend! Let me show you my cool toys!
10 doesn’t make me feel good at all
I know a Golden Jasper too! I wonder if this is the same good boy.
My neighbors had a cat and all he would do is peak over to our backyard from the tree in his yard.  Everytime we were doing something back there or whatever,  the cat would jump over the fence and lay on the back porch just watching us.  This happened for a couple of months and one day we went on vacation to New Mexico for about a week. We came back and the cat was laying still on the front porch. It was a sad moment. 💔
I really hope you give all those toys back to him at some point.
he kinda looked like Dug from "UP!" just thinner :D
You need to get a dog.  That's Jasper's way of telling you to rescue one. If you're at home all the time you can do it!  Go ahead and get one! You know you want to!
Jasper is one of the goodest boys of all time
So cute
I swear I have that exact same duck at home for my dogs
The ‘stuffed animal duck award’ is one of the highest honors that a Golden Can bestow on anybody.  It’s basically the equivalent of being knighted by the queen.  And 3 fav toys AND a stick?  That is like the award that Princess Leia gave to the hero’s at the end of Star Wars.  Consider yourself most honored.  

ps- Hope you feel better soon.
I love you Jasper
Those ducks are my dogs favorite toy! Petco stops carrying them it'll be a sad day for mr. B
turn
What the duck you looking at
Jasper is a good boy, gets all the pets.

Aww he is a good boy. I hope you get better though, my sister can't leave the house due to her health issues and it sucks.
jasper is so precious.
I'm a simple man, I see a dog, I upvote
Thank you so much!
I'm not gonna give you my toys.  They are for my wife
Hi
Thank you very much
Sorry if this has already been said, but can you get your own version of Jasper? He obviously brings you joy and you can have a companion more often. Also, Jasper can have a new buddy to visit/play with!
I wonder what it is about this duck that makes it so popular!!
Jasper loves you!!
Whoa, I had a greyhound named Jasper with the same duck dog toy! I bet Jasper is just as much of a good boy as mine was!

Edit: didn’t see “neighbors dog” and thought he was yours
Such a good boy!
"I don't know what's wrong with this guy, I have given him every damn toy I have to play fetch and he just keeps them all." -dog
best pupper ever
I live in a neighborhood that is very doggo friendly. Some of the neighbors let them off leash, which I didn't think was a great idea. 

Then, Roxy whose a pit-lab-blahblahblah mutt came running into my yard one day when I was sad. She flopped over and showed me her belly. And yes, of course I gave many scritches and scratches.

After a couple minutes she hopped up and trodded home. Roxy made me happy. I love dogs.
Those eyes:)
What kind of dog is that?
That’s exactly what I mean!! He does it only because he thinks it makes me feel better :)
OH MY GOSH THIS IS SO FREAKING SWEET!!
Good boi
Eighty nine thousand upvotes and counting.  This post deserves every one of them.  

How very wholesome.   And what a lovely sentiment you’ve shared.  Thank you.
One of our Golden’s does the same thing. She gets super excited, and then brings her favorite toy as a gift lol
 Jasper loves you!
Some do, some don’t have spinal issues
My dog barks like crazy until people pet him. It’s weird. Jasper you are adorable!
Hi! Please tell Jasper that he is THE BEST BOY and SO GOOD and that we all love him. 

And I hope your health doesn't bother you too much :(
My dogs have that same duck! But they ripped the head off and tore out all the stuffing. Not as good as Jasper
Cover of Science Magazine: JASPER HEALS ALL HURTZ
Everybody should have a goldie at least once.  They're such wonderful dogs.

I've heard them referred to as the "dumb blondes of the dog world" and I still don't know how I feel about that.  Mostly offended tbh.
What a great friend to have!  OP seems really nice too!  Sorry about the illness and hope you feel better!
Adorable!! Funny story: my newly adopted Dane x wolfie was adored by our middle aged man neighbor and he gave her (and my other dog, smaller breed) treats. 
Maybe a week of her being at home we had our neighbor explain to us that our dog had jumped the fence, entered his house through a dog door (no dogs were living there at the time) and he woke up to her laying in bed. Head on fucking pillow just staring into his eyes. 

Luckily he thought it was the best thing ever. We laugh so much, poor girl was a stray before she was adopted so I think she was a little confused as to who were her owners.

Side note to OP, I also suffer with health issues leaving me house bound and dogs help so so much mentally. Sending positive thoughts your way and I hope my story made you smile
Jasper is lonely
Thats so heart warming. It is almost like he is trying to entice you outside with an awesome toy.
Awww!!! 🥰
Good dog
‘Everybody liked that’
 Nice doggo
Ima bring you two sticks
My rescue Lab is named Jasper! He came with the name and I was unsure about it, but it’s really grown on me. He’s a total sweetie as well.
Dogs are the best 
Glad you have special Jasper
This is my dog everytime I come home. We have 3 dogs and a lot of toys but she always follows me with a toy back to the bedroom to her bed and drops it. She had 14 in her bed last time I cleaned it out.
I'TS ALMOST HIT 100K UPVOTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I’d die for Jasper. ❤️
My mates pup has the same duck!
Please cherish this dog
Golden Retriever are the best 😍
My beagle loves those exact ducks. We get them from 5 below and he will completely gut destroy them in 48 hours. The first 4 hours it him walking around showing us his new duck, then slowly he gets more aggressive with the duck. It usually ends with him and the fox hound playing tug of war with it.
I love that dogs love humans unconditionally if you treat them all right.
He has such a loving heart
The tail in mid-pendulum swing is what really highlights how happy he is to see you
That's one very sweet and generous pupper!!
Im not picking up a stick to give to you with my mouth 😑
Isn’t he just the absolute sweetest?
r/dogswithjobs
I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS HIT 100,000!!!!!! You have no idea how much joy this has brought me today. Thank you so much. Never in my wildest dreams did I think you’d love Jasper as much as I do!! ❤️❤️
Awww! What a good pup so cute.
We must’ve done something right to deserve dogs
What a kind and empathetic dog! I once lived next door to a cat who visited me frequently. I often offered him food but he just wanted the company. He would see my car pull in the driveway and before I’d even come out, he’d always meow and prance on over. I’d always pet him and talk with him. He passed away a couple of years ago due to cancer. He was a good boy and I miss him tremendously. In truth, he was my best friend. I’m sorry for digressing, but your story reminded me of him. 

So many people believe animals aren’t part of the family. That they’re disposable and don’t have feelings or souls. It baffles me that many people believe and act that way because I see evidence to the contrary continuously. The emotion, the kindness, love, and the empathy they demonstrate, just like this precious little guy here. 

You have a great friend and I know you care about him. Treasure every moment with him, okay? As someone with health issues as well that impacts life, I empathize. I wish you the best, and will keep you in my prayers. =)
Hey Jasper
Those eyes!
I had that same duck my dogs shredded the poor duck up.
The fuck has this got 100k likes for
Dogs are guardians of people and they are loyal and affectionate beyond comparison!!!
Jasper!!!    Horace!!!
I think you might have found your guardian angel OP. Now you have to get better
Jasper is a fuckin noob, he doesn't even have 60 defence, bitch ass still wears Runite armour
I love this cat!
Jasper is a true gem!

Not really relevant but my dog has that exact same toy
