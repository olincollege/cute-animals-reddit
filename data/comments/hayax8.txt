Lovely looking cat.  I hope it has a long happy life
This is the second video I’ve seen today of a cat in someone’s car! How can you tell there might be a little guy in there before you start the car?
Poor little baby :( those were some desperate meows, that was probably the first meal it had in a while. I hope they were able to take the kitten home and care for it, or give it to someone who could.
Got a kitten out of a coworker's engine a couple of days ago.  She saw it hiding under her car the day before and when she got to work she could hear it meowing.  Luckily she has a newer car and all the harmful engine parts were covered with plastic shields.  It hissed and growled as I pulled it out but began to purr and make biscuits as soon as I held it in my arms.  I named him Otto (auto).
What kind of treat was that used to lure him out?  He would have followed you to hell and back.
Poor guy was starving.
The same thing happened to me two weeks ago, now the little guy is asleep on my chest, snoring like mad. 
We’ve named him Monster.

Edit-

This is him. The top video is the first time he was comfortable enough to let us see him properly, then when I first got to touch him. Now he won’t leave us alone.

those ears!!!
Crisis averted.  I love happy endings.
  Many years back on a cold winter's morning my dad started his work truck only to find a small black kitten hiding in the block for warmth. It was almost killed. A huge vet bill later this kitten was never the same but became his forever pet.  This from a man who disliked pets of any kind. 
   This cat was called Drippy. Aptly named because of his accident he drooled constantly. He had no depth perception. He would fall off things and miss places to jump by a mile. 
   This cat would pay back my dad multiple times. As he aged he had a bad habit of falling asleep with a cigarette in his mouth.  Drippy would always bat him in the face and wake him up. Im not saying my dad was heartless but I've only ever seen him cry twice.  Once when his dad passed and the other when Drippy passed.
So good you've noticed it! Now enjoy those lovely ears <3
MEW! MEW! NOM NOM MEW!
Is this the same floof caught in the engine bay?
What's the food they brought it out with?
Why are cats so good 😭
So desperate to mew, he let the noms fall out of his face!
Heartbreaking. You can tell it's so scared but too hungry to turn down the food. Good on you (or whoever's hand that is) for being kind and thoughtful.
Awwww my heart is melted.
I thought they were luring it out with a flintstones pushpop.
The last thing she said/asked was: "Where's your mommy?"
At first I thought that was a glue stick. Happy you got the cat out. :)
Awww..the cries of hunger..poor thing
I know a Mogwai when I see one.
Hi guys, dumb question. I’ve heard horror stories about people finding cats in their cars (engine place?) mostly during winter because they hide there to keep warm.

I’m always paranoid that a cat might be chilling under the hood of my car when I turn on my engine. Does anyone know some tips to check to see if there’s a little critter hiding in your car before turning it on and driving off?
Poor thing looks starving. Stuff as much food as you can into the critter! I love it already.
Poor baby was starving!  What is she feeding him?
You definitely saved this kittens life! Thank you so much for having a big heart and rescuing it!!
That's awesome that she found a home! My sister rescued one of our cats stuck in an engine in the middle of winter. The owner of the car didn't notice the kitten and drove with the kitten in the engine for 20 minutes. When she arrived at work my sister heard the desperate mewing and coaxed her out with some tuna. She's 14 now and she's the best.
Congrats!
Is this the how to remove your Honda engine tutorial? Had no idea the engines were so cute.
When I rescued my cat a year ago from the streets, he was so starved, it was impossible to eat anything in front of him without him jumping over the plate and stealing anything he could. Not even the lettuce was safe. This happened for about 2-3 weeks, and then he started to realize he was never going to be hungry again, and is now actually very picky on what he eats. This video reminded me of that, the desperation of this poor baby. You are right indeed, thank God for the little mercies.
Cat:"I am stuck"

Person:"I have snack"

Cat goes brrrrrr
You are the chosen one!
I’m curious what that was he was feeding the cat?
This is all too familiar. We had a cat that kept jumping into cars and hitching rides while being right next to the engine. Took a day and a half to capture her and we had to use a trap to do it. She was super jumpy and afraid of everyone but she had to have been only a few weeks old. When we finally captured her, she was covered in oil and her little paws were burnt some. We bathed her and fed her and shes been with us for 2 years now. Shes still jumpy as hell, but when its quiet around the house she will cuddle up in someone's lap. If your engine meows one day, dont neglect it!
Those EARS 😍
My big dumb lovely boy came to us on Thanksgiving one year. He was covered in ticks and fleas, so we couldn’t keep him in the house overnight. We ended up putting him in the garage until the next day when we could take him to the vet. When he showed up my 10 year old self was naming him either Smiley or Buddy. Well when we went to get him and take him to the vet, we couldn’t find him. We had to call a cat-whisperer friend who discovered him in the axel of my mom’s jeep. It was decided his name would be Axel Smiley Buddy, but of course we just call him stupidhead, boogey, marshmallowhead, and many other names that aren’t his official names..
I found my cat the same way! He was tiny but incredibly loud. He was so terrified of us for the first few weeks and would scarf his food down just like that. Now he's almost 2 years old and a happy chubby lil snuggle bug 💖
Just gave ya gold for this. I saw a post that got so many awards, I calculated people had spent over $400 dollars on it. Inspired me to buy $2 worth of coins so I could give it to the next post I saw. Congrats!
Dear lord he was hungry! Glad he got a good home.
so cute!!!!!!
Is that cats name Gizmo?
The motor was purring lightly and had to check under the hood.
TF is she eating
Thank you for saving that precious baby!! Who knows when the last time it ate was!! Bless it’s little heart 😔
Nice work saving the lovely thing. I hate to say it but that kitten is going to shit thru the eye of a needle after so much milk and I think cheese?
Poor little cutie was starving!
Man, I could spend all day watching videos of kitten rescues
I had the same issue.  Picked up a kitten at a Wal Mart parking lot.  Coaxed him out by playing cat’s meowing on a loop from YouTube, food having failed.
I'm glad y'all knew it was there and got it out safely. Great job. 👍
How to decat your engine...
I hope this person took this cutie home.
Always check your engine before you drive. I have found two cats, an owl, and a snake in mine over the last 10 years.
My coworker and I rescued a kitten out from a car in our work's parking lot by doing almost exactly this! He's now a healthy, very tall orange boy called Wally.
Is there anything better than helping something so hungry? They’re meant to be like my cats who scream at the slightest hunger pangs. This little one was hungry for real
This is exactly how we got our cat. He was a tiny kitten hiding under my car one night leaving work. Wouldn’t come out and kept climbing up under the hood. Finally got him down and my wife couldn’t bring herself to turn him over to the local ASPCA shelter.

He turns 7 years old next month.
Second clip - “I’m sorry for what I said when I was hungry.”
Omg the little milk beard at the end I can’t I can’t I can’t 😭😭😭😭😩😩😩😩💕💕💕💕💕
There's so. Damn Gold in this Thread, made me Happy kinda wholesome, everyone stay awesome, and this kitty stays safe
This is the most gilded and cutest thread I’ve ever seen.
Look at ears!!
Glad the cat was lured out!

Side note: in the last part of the vid I'll assume maybe the cat was drinking a milk replacement.  If not, [please read more here](https://www.hillspet.com/cat-care/nutrition-feeding/is-milk-good-for-cats#:~:text=The%20truth%20is%20that%20most,were%20giving%20them%20a%20treat.) on why you shouldn't give milk to cats)
Just an FYI. When cats get weaned from their mothers they become allergic to milk. While they still love it they really shouldnt drink it. Thank you for saving that kitty tho!
Awww such a cute little kitty
Is that bread? I've never seen a cat eat bread, must have been really hungry!
Meowchanic
Big hungry chomps! Poor baby!
That melted my heart. . .
Give us news !!
Wow, whatever that food is, it pulled him out like a magnet!
What is that thing you’re feeding the cat?
Stray cats (and other small animals) will seek out a nice, cozy, warm place that provides them some shelter, and it often ends up being under the hood of a vehicle who’s engine is cooling down after a drive. 

Can’t imagine they enjoy it much in the morning though
You are a good human.
Once upon a time, YEARS ago, my mom started up her car, and a cat was under the hood.  She heard it, turned the car off, popped the hood, grabbed injured cat, slammed the hood, jumped in the car, started it up and took the cat to a vet.  His name became Tom, and lived in the garage the remainder of his years.

She decided to always knock on the hood, or honk the horn before starting the car from that day on.
I worked in a auto shop for a little while. Within my first week, I opened a hood...and i found 2 full grown kitties dead in the engine bay. Eyes still wide open.

I was mortified. Glad this kitty got out okay.
Thank you for the bit showing the kitty was safely away from the car. ❤️
What is that? Looks like a cheese stick, has a UPC like mentos, and is orange like a push-pop.
Our cat came to us the same way. Somehow he survived the trip from the train station to my home in the bumper of my car. We heard him meowing in the garage hours later and he hid in the bumper when we first saw him. Probably eight weeks old at the time, even smaller than this guy.
Poor baby. Kind owner.
Poor skinny baby, anyone know what that thing is that is being fed to the kitten? Glad she is being fattened up.
How do you spot such cuteness. I’m in uk but only scared to checking under my car in case I find even more then the 100s it already has. 

Anyone tell me if I would be able to find out if there is one from the outside?
Watching it eat the roll vividly  brings to mind the insane number of cats here in NZ annihilating our often defenseless fauna. 

People here really need to get on board with keeping their killing machines locked in at night and well fed otherwise.
Such a loud little dude/dudette. So damn cute.
Reminds me of when I found Stanley. He was just a tiny little kitten who was sitting in a flower pot at my parent’s house on a blistering hot summer day. When I finally got ahold of him, his poor paws were burnt raw by the hot asphalt and that’s why he was sitting in the flower pot. After a few days he introduced himself to us (we put him in our basement and left the door open for when he was ready to come say hello) and was the loviest cat I had ever met.
This is exactly how I found my rescue. She was on top of the transmission of one of our work trucks. We have a colony of strays, and all the other strays hissed at her like she didn't belong so she went up there. Tiny little chocolate torty, mewing. Managed to get her out, get her all healthy and happy, took care of her until she was old enough to get her fixed, then got her a nice forever home with a coworker. She had earmites and worms when I got her out too. She's all healthy and happy now.
The poor little darling, so hungry
Thank good for people patient enough to check
I just realized with people wfh and not driving as much, this kind of thing might happen more often.
Damn, gold fairy out here!
Awww, my ❤️!
Thank you for saving that kitten!
Omg my heart. Bless this poor baby.
What is this snack that the kitty must have? I want to get some for my boy.
Even I am moved by this.
Similar situation happened to me once. I had to remove the wheel to remove a cat.
Poor baby was starving
Watched the version without sound... Clicked hoping for sound. Got sound. Thank goodness. Good kitty.
This is basically how I lured to kittens off the road. Except I had a piece of that really cheap cake you see at the grocery store with little plastic soccer figurines and airbrushed turf. They were in the middle of the highway in the early morning hours. Visually skin and bones. So I opened the car door, grabbed the plate and placed it on the road. It was like kitty fishing. As soon as the little one would start chowing down on the icing I would grab the nape of their neck and toss them in the back. One after the other. 

Here is one of them washing her toy mouse https://i.imgur.com/U5I7nSM.gifv
Dude, looking the size of ears and paws, this kitten will turn to a BIG cat
What is she feeding it?
You sure that's not a gremlin
Question! How is the best way to get the cat after it is coaxed out??? I imagine: wait a bit while they are eating, and get them to sniff you and start trying to pet it?? Get some pets in?? Then grab em by the scruff to get them in a crate or wrapped in a towel???

We had a feral young cat show up at the shop but she waltzed in and meowed to high heaven for food so we gave her some and she scarfed it down and never left!! 🥰
What is in your hand that the cat is loving so much?
Awww I bet that kitty napped for a while afterwards - probably purred itself to sleep
I’m jealous of the people who find little kittens they have to keep
That cats name is popsicle now
很可爱
And thats how cats die in the winter. They snuggle up against your warm motor. Then they become engine jelly when you start your engine the next morning
What is the cat eating? This is driving me crazy.
What brand of cat is that?
Poo things Starvin look at him go!
He’s like “Oh God thank God I was starving please Oh my God it’s so good can I adopt you!?” :-)
Did that cat just say "come on" when he was trying to rip a chunk of that off?
Aww indeed! :)
Baby bobcat ftw
Li'l Lynx Point! Beautiful!❤😻
K, but wait... Is that an individually-wrapped hot dog?
Thank you for saving this starving little kitten, I hope you keep him and give him a long happy life.
... I simply cannot overstate just how much it breaks my heart to see an animal so hungry. He's DESPERATE for that food!!
I thought it was eating a glue stick
I got my cat the same way
My cat got out the other day, and while we were frantically looking for her, my husband had a moment to think and told me to check under the hoods of all the cars. Sure enough, there she was, stuck under the hood of one of the cars; I could hear her meows as I walked up to the car.
Aww he looked so skinny. He’s so lucky to have crossed paths with you
That damn cat looks like a gremlin. Better not be feeding it after midnight.
Can someone provide a very basic and non detailed description of what would’ve happened to that cad had it not left that part of the car
He was Hongry!
Such a hungry little cutie!
You poor thing. You’re starving.  💜💜💜
"GIMME THE NUMNUM STICK!!!" That kitten.
That’s exactly how we ended up with a kitten only three weeks ago.
Let me take this opportunity to remind people to check your car engine if you have kittens outside your house. Check from top to bottom of your engine. I had 5 kittens in my car engine once, took a lot of time to get them out.
Hope you all have an amazing day (:
Very cool, my vet took in a cat that took shelter in someone’s car. The didn’t realize it and started the car, the poor kitty lost one eye, an ear and required several surgeries. Cat seems ok now but has no eyelids on the one eye it does have.
Bless you, this is amazing. You made my day!
Former boss of mine had a cat stuck under his hood and asshole drove to work anyways and didn't really seem to care. I was tempted to break his window so I could pop the hood and get to it
As a mechanic you would not believe the amount of dead cats (mostly kittens) I’ve had to pull out of vehicles. 

Pulled one out of my father in laws truck after a trip to the beach just two weeks ago.
Happy lives for all? Specially that kitty 🐱
I'm not really a animal person, but i like to set aside some time on the weekends to do this for people. I figure it's just a few bucks and a walk down to my basement. I like to think I'm making a difference.
When giving a cat a little bit of salami actually saved its life.
I HOPE EVERYONE HERE HAS A HAPPY LIFE
Don’t give malk to cats
This thread must be the end of the rainbow I’ve always heard about
I want to know what that stuff was to get a cat out of its safe space...
Poor baby is starving.  Good thing you found him.  Such a cute little thing.  ❤️❤️❤️
Had this happen with my boy (my cat) Luke!  A woman got in her car in Camarillo and drove to LA (45 min drive).  When she got to the city she heard a cat crying.  The sound would go away when she slowed or stopped.  She finally got out and checked under her car to find my little Luke.  He came right out.  Glad you saved you’re buddy.  It’ll be fun!
A nice baby fuzzy! Hooman was such a bro!
all of you deserve a long live
u/cafe_con_la_bruja_
Aww, beebee was so hungry
I really needed to see this after that other cat video today made me cry.
HIS LITTLE MILK BEARD
Raspy lil voice
The sweetness!!!
Poor baby. He was so thin!
Hungry little cutie, what with how quickly he crawled out for the food. I can tell he'll grow up into one beautiful cat.
A family of rats chewing wires under the hood of my wife’s Lexus had a much different outcome last winter.
NOM NOM NOM
HEY!! *Cats/kittens are lactose intolerant*!!!.
Dont dehydrate with cow milk!  Feed cooked chicken, lamb with tiny bit of white rice. Offer lots of water, (eyedropper?) Warm snuggles, shoulder rides. You are very lucky to have a best friend ❤ forever!!
Awww.  His little milk beard.  Awww.
You have a cat now. Like everyone else is saying: both you and it will have longer, happier lives.
Thank you so much for feeding this skinny little floof! I know with your feeding and affection you will MAKE CAT FAT!! ❤
Awww...my heart is so full. Would rather live here then r/politics.
Awwwh poor baby is just hungies
What is he eating! Miracle food!
What’s with the crazy amount of gilded comments? Did a leprechaun stop by?
Man i bet that engine purrs
I liked when the kitten meowed and the piece of hot dog went flying out.
literally awwwwwwwwwww!
Bless the person and bless this kitten. Wish nothing but the best for them.
You car just gave birth to a cat
Good day to you and you and especially YOU 😘
Dat boi loves some ice cream
This person is speaking Chinese. I can't imagine this will end well...
I wish i could have seen how the lady went about picking the kitty up and transporting him. I have this very real and very specific fear that I'll be in a situation like this but I'll go to pick him up and the kitten will squirm and run away or something, and I won't be able to save him.
Aw, dang. This reminded me of an incident when I was a kid (around 8 at the time). We had a neighbor who all the parents warned us away from. Said neighbor had stray cats around his house, and one day one got stuck (or refused to come out of) the inside of his truck. After getting frustrated by trying to lure him out and failing for about a quarter of an hour, the asshat turned on the engine and revved it. The screaming had all the neighbors calling the police, and he had the gall to act surprised that it didn't "just scare him out" as blood splattered onto the driveway and the kitten died horrifically. 

I sometimes wonder how his kids grew up, as everyone in the neighborhood marked that family as the one you "stay away from." I still remember hearing the screeches, as we were only a couple houses away. 

Oof. Weird to get random flashbacks from Reddit.
cats can have little a salami
My dad was driving to work one day and on the highway he heard the engine making strange noises. He pulled over and discovered 5 kittens hiding in the engine bay! Thankfully they were all fine, so he took them to work and let his coworkers play with them. Could have been a much worse, I'm glad they all survived somehow.
My dad killed one of our kitten’s in the fan belt of our old Chevy. They would crawl up near the warm engine when it was cold out. Not a fun noise to hear when your 5.
Our cat just got put down today. So broken up. This just made my day a little better. Thank you!
Op you just saved a life. Blessings
Looks like a demon, but in an adorable way
That’s quick thinking! One time my cousin said he went to turn his car on when it was cold out not knowing there was a cat sleeping under the hood near the engine parts and the cat got tangled up when he went to start it and the car exploded.
She was so hungry.
Best glow up I've seen today 😍
Now this person have a cat
Monch monch monch
So hungry!
Huh I didn't know kittens loved Flintstones pushpops so much
Chez stock
Sweet hungry baby
Nom nom nom, safe now, nom nom nom, water fine
Munch munch munch
You're a good person!
Why didn’t I think of that?!? I removed the whole tire to get a kitten out once.
r/mademehappycry
Nice
Hope little boi is a happy one
Hope the cat finds a safe loving home.
I’ve never heard a more human nom nom in my life the cat was loving it
So where's the cat now?
Poor hungry little baby! So sweet. Hope he has a long and happy life! 🐱
Poor thing, I hope someone took it home and gave it a good meal and a warm place to sleep.
Is that cheese?
Oh, it’s so cute. So precious. 
So Glad you rescued it. 
It could have been killed.
My HS buddy's family always had shining spots in the middle of their car hoods. Their cat liked a warm engine AND a view of the yard.
Thank the human instead
Is he a stray and if so will you keep?  Darn I love animals!
Aww that lil guy was starving
I hope this little guy/gal has a long happy life with all the food and toys he can imagine. I hate seeing kitties (other animals too) go hungry. I’d feed them all if I could. We don’t deserve these precious creatures, but they deserve the world
Bucs jerseys aren’t too bad. It’s great the Pats switched uniforms because the former will always represent the Brady era.
This is not your video I’ve seen this
I hope everyone that sees this finds a little kitten and has a long happy life.
Life hack
Those ears are so big.
It’s always smart to keep some dog or cat snack in your car. You never know when one will hiding or you find a pet that’s gotten out or a dog who
Is alone and seems really aggressive but it’s just defensive. Some nice food is always welcoming and it’ll build trust. Kudos for helping out this little cutie
All that's missing is a little burp at the end.
Look at those ears!!!
My family had a cat that literally climbed up into the motor after the first day we got her, it was early in the morning and we had to be to school in like thirty minutes. Definitely the most memorable moment with her, I miss Hoka.
What are they feeding it?
This is like my mum dragging me to family zoom calls with Oreos
Something similar happened to me. In the morning I go out to warm up the car and go back to the house and I noticed a kitten running around my car. I get back out of the house and get back in the car, no kitten around and I didnt think anything of it. 

I get to work, 20 minute freeway drive; park my car and go into the office. Lunch time comes and I go out to my car and I see a little kitten running around my car, I'm like hmmm this cat looks familiar. I picked it up and it was the same kitten, its hair was all blown back and it had pebbles and dirt stuck in its fur. So I decided to keep it and took it home, but things didnt go well, I'll spare you the details.
Reminds me of the time when our detailer was washing a car, popped the hood, and saw a huge cat just sitting there behind the engine bay. Was not this easy getting her out unfortunately lol.
Those ears though!!! Man, there’s no way that we would be best friends and have a new family member after finding this little batty coda!!!
Such a pretty little thing. I hope it grows up well.
Ok, good: for the first 26 seconds I was like "Please tell me you adopted that little gremlin."

I was not disappointed.
I don't understand how animals get into engines and actually survive .
AAAWWW, this is awesome!
Oh my goodness I love it so much!! A+ hero work!!

This just happened at my job!! Our phlebotomist has a teensy kitten refusing to come out of the bowels of her engine. Several people tried for hours, and they left the hood up in case he would hopefully pop out on his own. It had been raining a lot the few days before and was raining that day and little guy probably was looking for somewhere warm and dry. I was outside taking temps for about a half an hour and walked over to check it out since the big scene had calmed down, and he walked on out and yelled very furiously about the whole thing. I was set to take him home because no one else was going to. I sent my husband a picture and all he replied with was, “so do we have six cats now?” My co worker ended up taking kitty to her son and his family. I admit I was a little bit sad.. I don’t know if there is such a thing as “enough cats” but we are holding steady at 5 for now. 

Thanks for posting the video!! I hope future updates and pics are on the table as well!!
That’s a pair of ears to grow into..
CATS ARE LACTOSE INTOLERANT
Quite the cute cat. I’m glad that they were rescued.
If anyone wants to know what the lady was saying in Mandarin, it was basically "come on, come on" and "where's your mom?"
That poor baby! We need more people like you out there!
Oh I didn't even think about that! Thanks!
dont give milk to little cats
The kind things you do for little creatures...
Now *that's* how you socialize a spicy feral kitten!
My story of the hidden cat is slightly different.  Got into the full size van and heard meowing after starting the engine.   I searched the van thinking it had come inside through an open window but I couldn't find it. So I  pulled out of the driveway and started going down the street. I heard more meowing until my neighbor honked at me. Turns out the cat had been napping on top of the roof of the van where I couldn't see before I got in the car.  Cat was fine and she never slept there again.
while on vacation we saw a little kitten crawling into our car. after clearing the whole car we found it somewhere behind the front wheel :)
Where can I find some of this kitten crack?
I did this recently except it was an otter and it was pissed off. I also didn't use any food and instead just popped the hood of the car. It jumped out in a furious and stinky explosion.
It’s like crack but for cats.
What was that you fed him to lure him out?
oh heck yea, he's hongry
I thought that was a chikostick at first but it bit too easy.
Lovely to see a happy ending, he was so hungry and thirsty
This is wholesome and needed today. Thanks
dont give milk to a kitten if u dont want it to die of exsiccosis
So happy to see this after that heart breaking video in r wellthatsucks
How/why did this little cutie even wedge him/herself in there!? :O
Oliver and Company. Thanks for saving the little guy.
Awww he was so hungry
Saved by the power of sosig
I have been in multiple incidents similar to this but not all kittens made it out alive.
poor thing
Is that a stick of earwax?
This thread is full of love. Cats tend to do that. Thank you for this.
Awww little kitty was so hungry
Kitten has a better beard than I do.
*sees comment thread full of gold*

What the hell happened here?
Didn't realise cats eat those
I hope we get an update some day
r/catswhoyell
This chat makes my heart happy :)
Name him clank
What is that
I had that same problem once, except it was a wild fucking raccoon that wouldn't get out.
Haha it's so cute it's eating out of a makeup bowl.
When r/catswhoyell and r/wholesome have a ~~baby~~ kitten
Happy life for all
Called:  I am hungry. 

Food rescued me.
So that’s why they call it a CATalectic converter!!
Poor baby was so hungry. I’m glad she’s was saved.
awwwww poor thing was hungry :(((
Somebody pls reverse this
Well at least you got a gift during these wild times
r/catswhoyell
Congratulations on your new cat
Happy wife. Happy life.
PRECIOUS BABY
Who eats string cheese like that?
Cute kitty!

FYI cow milk is not good for cats, even though all media shows cats drinking milk...
What treat is that
I desperately needed this after the hallway memories video
Poor little baby 😌
It looks so desperate :( 
Btw, the woman you heard in the video was asking “where is your mom?” to the kitty.
Awww
Fear and hunger in those eyes. Then came you. ❤️
Something something purrs like a kitten
That is a hungry kitten!!! I’m so glad it got inside
Must have been starving!
My heart! ❤️
Baby was starving :(
Damn I hope that isn't cow milk.
Oh wow! Thank god he was alright and you noticed him!
I love this! What a happy little kitten
That’s actually how I found my cat Luna! She was hiding inside my brothers engine and we were able to get her out by the tires after 2 hours of trying. She wasn’t easy to get out since she was very cautious, still is. It’s been a little more than 2 years and she’s well loved!
Rule number 32.
Cutest dog i've seen today
Looks like it was lagging
Aww what a hungry baby
When the kitten said “MEW MEW MLEM MREW” I felt that
That’s what I do with my rats when they go to hide where they’re not supposed to
Lol
In China cats go "miao miao", 喵喵, which is the radical for "mouth" next to the character for "rice seedling", because it is the crying mouth (口) of a cat (猫).
Cat is written as 猫, "the beast (犭, short of 獣) that protects the rice seedlings (苗) from mice."

Interestingly, this character is one of the few instances of reverse character transference from Japan to China, where the character for cat was previously the same as the character for the "tanuki" racoon-dog (狸), "the beast (犭) of the village (里)."

Furthermore, although the character is officially recognized as the Chinese character for a cat's cry *within Japan*, it does not appear to have an official reading *in Japanese* - which would presumably be "nyan", though that is normally written in phonetic characters like "ニャーン".

So this represents a *derived loan onomatopoeia ideogram*... and is pronounced "miao" in Chinese, but *not* "nyan" in Japan.

Who knew orange push-up’s could lure a cat out of a car engine?
Is someone making that awfully loud meowing sound? There's no way that's coming from the cat while it's eating.
This happened to my pop with my aunt's cat, it didn't end as well as this did
Lol I had this happen but got no upvotes
Yea this is some much needed empathy.
G
Listen to that engine purr
Ears to you!
aww you saved the baby
That's how I wake up my gf.....  🙃😉🙃😜😜😜
😙😙
Look at those ears!
[removed]
We're defs gonna need a before and after in a few months
How frightening!
Thank you for rescuing the kitten!❤️
Nice.
Big ears
Honestly, I thought it was a Fenix Fox at first. xD
That's such a beautiful little kitten
What exactly did you use to lure the kitty with?  I must get some of that for my cats.
is there a subreddit specifically for animals being nursed back to health?
What kind of idiot would put a kitten under a Truck ?
Chinese?
Oh that thing is sooo thin!!!!
Looks like that cat is feral for the long haul
What a cute
This made my heart happy.
Bless your heart.
Is dis cheese?
One of my family’s best cats was acquired pretty much the same way. Glad the baby is safe!
Everyone is simping for gold, but other than that, that cat is so cute 😳
The
Why use big word when little word do trick
That milk goatee at the end had me laughing! So cute!
What are they feeding the kitten?
That cat looks like a lemur.
This beauty is what we need more of. Not this rioting shit
omg little guy was starving :(
I had to lure a stray kitten out from inside the underbody of a car once. I wish I thought of luring it with a stick of meat like that, ‘cause it took me hours to get him out. On the plus side, that cat is now 5 or 6 years old and living happily with my mom and her other cat.
Nice
Omg so cute!
I really thought he rescued the cat with an orange creamsicle 😭😭
r/specializedtools
The most i could get out of what she was saying with my broken mandarin was “come out come out come come” and “where’s your mom?” lol this is adorable
Darwin just stop following you.
Bless her heart, this baby was starving.
that cat can talk  😳
The way it looks at the little cheese stick OH MY GO-
That poor kitty looked like it was starrrrving! Glad you saved its life ❤️
We think the same thing happened to our youngest kitty. I found her in the middle median of a 6 lane highway on my way home from work with a fractured back leg. There’s no way she could have crossed during rush hour and not gotten hit, so we assume she had been in an engine and thrown/fallen out on the highway. She’s now chunky and passed out in my husband’s lap, happy as can be, a year later. Found kitties are the best kitties!
What language is the lady speaking? Tagalog?
Obviously a Dodge Charger Cat Pack.
*That* is a pretty kitty.  Hope it lives forever
That precious baby is going to tear up that house to shreds.

Wow that reminds me of growing up in the country...we would have like 10 cats just huddled against the engine in the winter time.  My mom would rev the engine 150x before we could back out of the driveway.  Then there was the one time   when a cat just stayed in there...broken my little kid heart!
You sir are a hero.
I needed to see something good happen, thank you. I've been profoundly sad lately.
Toyota Tacoma?
Duno man, I get smeagol vibes..
Is that a Flintstones push pop?
You showered this lil one with food and love may God shower you with the same!
We had a neighborhood cat with a collar and then one day the collar was just gone.  We figured it got snagged somewhere.

2 years later, I found out that somewhere was my engine block.  Thankfully that kitty was okay!
Lamborghini Mercie
"Thank god for the little mercies."

Just think for a second how  abhorant that is. All loving, my ass.
That poor baby... im so glad he got out in one piece!
Well done sir/madam.
Cat really like dangerous place eh? Like last night 3 of my kittens went up the ladder that was on the wall and into my house which don't have ceilings(for now). 2 of it cannot get down by itself so someone has to get it.
Ok, fuck this, why do videos just randomly  not work on reddit? And gifs!!
That little guy brought tears to my eyes.  The last two weeks, I’ve forgotten there is innocence and beauty still somewhere in this world.
I'm curious how you transitioned from feeding to grabbing...
I hope that's not cow milk- Poor little fella
I speak a little, depending on average trends
We had a cat that loved big trucks. Whenever we were getting a piece of furniture delivered, he would climb up in the back, and up underneath the chassis, inspecting everything. If he heard a truck pull up in front of the house, he'd immediately run to it like it was there for him. We always made sure that we had eyes on Jake before they left. Even so, we would always tell them that if they got to their next delivery and found Jake on board, to give us a call we'd go pick him up.
Looked like chapstick at first
Every trucker has 100 of these stories.
So dangerous! That’s why you gotta be careful in winter starting your car. Animals will get in under the hood at night and the outcome can be horrible.
God don’t you just hate it when you go to check your oil levels and find a little petrified kitten corpse under your hood. Like UGH. WHY ME. The worst.
My cat acts like this around any food.
Sweet milk beard lil bro!
Awww poor baby
Awww.... I want a kit! But it wouldn't be fair to the precious baby.... have to spend every weekend at parents, taking care of them. Their doggo would think that a cutie like this one is a chew toy. I'm sad.
u/vredditshare
Perfext approach
Is that a cheese stick?
This wholesome comment section made my day better.
Plot twist.Its a glue bar
Congratulations on your new pet cat.
It's soooo good to see this! -- makes me forgot the chaos outside.
Cow's milk gives the shit but there is Bitch Milk at pet stores. Thank you for sharing.
I had to save a kitten like that earlier this year, but, it was at a red light during traffic.  I had to stop the car in front of me from driving off when the little shit ran up into the wheel area.  Also had no food to coax it out... got clawed up pretty good, and my hand got burned by something around the engine, but i saved the little turd and would do so again.  Hes at his new home all happy and junk.
My gf recently found got a kitten from a car, too bad now it’s been 6 months and he’s a total asshole cat
So sad...so hungry.  Thankful you rescued the baby...
Is that one of those chick-o-sticks or whatever
Thank god for people like you
You can see he's trembling, that's probably more food than he's seen in a week.
Hey OP? Why was the cat in the car?
 Aw the poor thing. Good job rescuing it!
The fuck is that thing he's feeding it?
Aw. Poor little thing is starving. Such a beautiful. I already have one rescue cat but would’ve adopted that cat on a second
Poor baby.  Glad they were able to get it to come out.  So thin and weedy looking.  I hope it recovers well.
Love that milk beard at the end. Too cute
Poor little thing was probably starving and dehydrated. Glad they got it out safely.
His ears are so big 😭
God knows nothing of mercy
You all made my good.
Milk beard. So cute and this is also why you should always check under your hood and wheel wells.
Lucky kitty
Mechanics save lives
Poor baby !  It looks so hungry !  Thank you for taking care of it.
Kitty's name is Spock
I just go to the toilet together
This is how I got my first and most beloved cat when I was 5!
Enjoy your new cat :)
I've killed two cats gym them climbing into places like that.
sweet kitty
This made me so happy! Thank you whoever saved this kitty!
Oh my goodness! The poor baby was so hungry! I hope you give/find it a wonderful home where they always have enough to eat and a warm person to cuddle with.
So hungry! I acquired a kitty like this, found in a van I was driving for work.
Awesome sauce right there!!👍🏼👍🏼😍
Cats are lactose intolerant
What is that food you're using to lure him/her out?
big time HANGRY
is the cat a stray?
For anyone wondering its chinese amd they're just saying come out come out come here come here over and over again
Can someone explain to me how you prepare for and do this? I.e., what do you have in your car or house? How do you approach the cat/animal? One of the things that comes to mind is having antiseptics in case they scratch you (infection control). Whenever I see a stray animal I want to help but don't know how to draw them to me and exactly how to behave.
What
Poor tiny thing
You have earned a place in kitty heaven.
Well I'm never driving my car again now
Turned into David Suzuki at the end there.
Thank god someone found the cat before the driver returned
That milk beard though!
My mom found out the cat was in the engine the hard way
Lo engorda para comerselo ;v
That is baby
This thread is the cats ass.
Hehehe doggy
so cute
So cute
Catmobiles and Catavans are the two most common cat generators.
That was one hungry little razor floof.  Thanks for caring for it!
Y’all are beautiful and take good care of that kitty
Guys, how can I reply to that conversation where everyone is getting gold?  this app.... I’m so confused.
I have those same green bowl
Congrats on your lovely new cat!
Howd it get up in there in like that?
I hope all of you had a good day. Love all y’all!
Thought the kitten was being fed a push popsicle
I saw a cat jump into somones jeep the other day, hope it's okay
Poor starving baby!!!
Repost
> Kitten adopts food dispenser.

Once they brush their cheeks on you, the pact is sealed.  You now belong to the kitten.
This is literally how I got my cat, she was stuck in the engine block of a car on an 100+ degree day in August. 7 years later she’s fat and cranky. Still love her tho
That sucks I was late
Food always does the trick!
<3 <3 <3 <3
The beby hungy
The meows aound dubbed but he/she a beauty
Thank you for the golds, kind strangers! ❤️
He monch
Yup...replicate this X 6 and you have my fall of ‘19 in a catshell
the comments have more gold awards than the actual post lmao
There, it ended. Are you happy now?
So precious bless you for saving that tiny life. May you have your friend for a good many years!!
Come out. Come come come come. Where’s your mom?
Beautiful
Kitty needs some assistance and doesnt know it. Look at him!
DO NOT give milk to cats.
I always see gold on people’s comments. What does that mean?
What’s a gold?
Cats are lactose intolerant, feeding it milk is a good way to make it shit
Oh Happy Day (oh happy daaaay) oh HAPPY DAY
Cute little feral ball of "I'ma fuck you up". Rip hands/wrists. Got that t-shirt
My cat just freaked out.
That little milk goatee at the end! So adorable
What could that be that works like magic at summoning kittens?
Your now the kitties hero and mine. Thank you for saving a life.
THIS IS SO CUTE!!!!! Cat had to have brain freeze.
Found out a little longer and had a baby
Good luck and blessings your way for both of you!!
Beautiful kitty.
What is that they’re baiting the cat with? I cannot figure it out 😳
I figured I’d see someone say this but why use a popsicle and not.... cat food? That cat is probably starved. I’m so glad to see an animal be saved but just confused.
This is totally adorable! Just a reminder: please don’t feed cat with such meat products. They have a terribly high amount of salt which has major negative effect on cats’ kidneys (apparently they’re not even healthy to humans!)
Hungry baby!!
Ok now grab the little baby and take it inside where it belongs.
He ears too big for he got dang head. XD
Is that a house cat?? Or something else 🤔
Thank you for the feeding 👍
Did you adopt it?
So much gold in here...
good stuff!
Can someone tell me why cats like hid under cars?
This thread is making me so glad I have a car in a cat-proof garage.
Sooo much gold everywhere on this thread
I thought this was an orange push-up then I thought it was cheese...So is this cheese for cats?
What is that cat eating? It looks like meat chapstick in a jelly lifesavers wrapping. I’m guessing some kind of meat snack?
This is one of my biggest fears. Ughh. I wouldn't be able to live with myself
Oh sick, I have that same rug
r/catswhoyell
What's the food?
Have you checked to see what kind of kitten that is? It looks like a wildcat of some kind....lynx?  Edit: also very very cute...
I’m loving all the inter-user love in the comments! That made me almost as happy as the little kitty!
This sub may be the most appropriately named sub of em all. I rarely come across a front page post from here where I don't LITERALLY say Awww ffs! This one just got me in the heart!
Poor lil hungry baby :(((
Please follow up with how kitty is doing. She was so thin. Glad you found her.
Damn that kitten must have been starving, thankgod for this lady
I meant the picture.
Is that a meat pop up?
How do you get so big eating food of this kind?
What is that cheese? 

Cute video!
