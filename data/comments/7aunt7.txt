If I ever saw puppies as cute as these guys in person,  I'm not sure I could continue with my planned day.
I'd just sit and watch them
I am just sitting here wondering how this person got 4 floofees pups to sit and stay on the swing
Can we talk about the one with it’s tongue stuck out? Because that’s my favorite one. 
Just leave em like that and go to work. Come back to zero furniture damage and all the cute.
If an alien race came to Earth and asked what the internet is, I would show them this. 
Sit. Sway. Good boys. 
[removed]
Which breed are they???
Looks like the band KISS in another multiverse
Puppos do not adhere to the laws of physics 
/r/PupsOnSwings
I just wanna lay on the floor and be hugged by all of them. 
If I was a death row inmate and had a choice between my favorite meal or watching these fluffy heaven pillows I would choose them every time.
Surprised no one is asking this... What are those swings? 

Personalities from left to right:

Curious Doggo: is completely fascinated by everything around him and can't sit still.

Fun Doge: knows what feels right and proud to show it. 

Smart Dog: understands what's going on and where the camera is. 

Shy Doggie: doesn't like the Limelight, stays far back to avoid confrontation by the fact he doesn't know how to sit.
look at those little tails swinging through the dirt 
I quadruple dog dare you not to upvote this
“Swing, swing, swing, swing”
Not FAIR. I'm trying to drown my sorrows ain beer and old punk rock and you show me FLOOF...on SWINGS...fuck. Now I'm all full of cute. Thanks r/aww
I believe this scene could bring about world peace. 
Sooo, first comment ever; what breeeed?
This is actually the most adorable thing I've ever seen in my life.
This may in fact be the cutest thing I have ever seen. I can watch these cute swinging balls fluff all god damn day
They could be planning a bank heist and we wouldn't know it
could you close your mouth Tom? you're breathing on me as you swing past, and it is not appreciated. 
😐😛😐😐
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
Too cutw
"Oh hey, neat." "swing swing swing swang swung smlem" "what is my life? Does this pitiful existence have true value? A purpose?" "someone help me"
I believe that if we train dogs and build swings to recreate this scene in various key places around the globe, we could achieve pretty close to world peace.
When we die, I'd like to think this is the first thing we see, but they speak in riddles and giggle amongst themselves while you try to defend your life choices. 
How did you manage to get 4 puppies to sit still this long. You should be a Fortune 500 CEO. 
Three of them look totally unamused, while homeboy is just stupid happy with his tongue out. 
My wife said this is what she pictures going through my head when she says, “I have something important to tell you.”
Aaaand to the top of reddit you go!
Good

Shut it down, folks. This is it. We've reached the cuteness singularity.
The KISS Army's hounds of hell.
Good
everybody but the second boy looks completely serious. 
That’s ridiculously cute. 
I love the 4 distinct personalities - props to derp good boi
Their little front paws ;_;
Can someone make a perfect loop?
Are we all just gonna ignore that the third doggo almost loops perfectly? Give this unsung good boy some lovin!
It’s funny and cute till you realise their feet are glued :,(
It feels strangely like the subway morning commute.  
  
*Bright and early for their daily races*  
*Going nowhere, going nowhere* . . .  
  
Edit: damn you, Mr. Tongue, [you ruin everything](https://gifsound.com/?gifv=6tb3km2&v=6QIBd42_T2w).
Sorry kids. This is their swing now.
"You've come to the wrong neighbourhood"
Four swinging ruffs 
I can watch them all day!!! ❤️❤️❤️
The one on our far right is not entertained, watch as his attention goes adrift 
god damn it.......why so cute!!
their eyebrows make them look so angry >:[
u/figgityfuckmeright
u/discipleofoden
2nd doggo is enjoying every sec of it.
Anyone else feel like you can tell these dogs are Asian?
On the fourth day of Christmas my true love sent to me...!
I like the one with the tongue sticking out 👅
All of them are cute.
I must know the breed, these guys are the CUTEST!
Omg cuteness overload. I wanna hug and sleep with all of them.
May I please have one?
Fake. They're obviously glued down.
THEIR LITTLE TAILS DRAGGING ARE KILLING ME!!
4-2-3-1
I am a simple man I see G O O D B O Y S and I upvote.
How do you use this swing? There isn't this kind of swing in place where I live. 
Immediately thought of the personalities for these little puppers as the Ninja Turtles.

#1 Leobarko
#2 Woofelabgelo
#3 Doggotello
#4 Ruffael

Also - where the fuck is the human to book their snoots?!

Puppy #2 is like "see guys its fun right?! Like I said it would be!"
Breed?
Joseph Furrier
I'm going to guess this was taken in China. Due to the yellow and blue gym equipment that's scattered around every city in this country.
Number 3 does *not* seem to be having fun.
I love them.
2 seems to be the only one that is into it.
My moods live on that swing same push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow.
SO cute  I wish I had one
Put this on r/eyebleach
Sooooo super cute :)
Now this is my kinda therapy.
What is it with imgur? Seem like most of the time the image just doesn't work. I wait and wait and nothing appears in the browser.
I aspire to be as happy and content as these fluffy bois.
2,4,3,1
Quadruplet Pandapups!
😹😹😹
The  2 on the right look as if they're considering jumping soon. The 2 left side are  going with it weeeee
Aaaaw it made me smile !
Four boys on the swings, only one sticking out tongue.
🙂😛🙂🙂
That’s the best KISS tribute band I’ve ever seen 
What kind of dogs are these?
Their tails dragging on the ground o m g !!! I️ notice something cuter every loop 
R/pupsonswings
Pups 1 & 4 turn their heads the same way at the same time. It's so darn cute. All of it is so darn cute!!! 
Current mood. 
The white fur above their eyes makes them all look evil, third one in is eye fucking the camera the whole time.
Please someone make this a perfectloop
I am having a really shitty day right now and this seriously helped make my day a little better. Thank you OP ._. 
T O O C U T E
nononononononono I can’t focus on anything anymore.
Four swinging fluffs

Three French hens

Two turtle doves

Not knowing this was a gif I said to my self "please tell me they swing"
the third one is vexed because swings 1&2 are going faster.
You know in games when your score got so high you flipped it and it went back to zero? These guys are so cute they made me angry
Why do I think of old asian men doing tai-chi when I see this?
Approximately 4½ seconds. That's how long they could sit still on the swing <3
their little tails dragging are so cute
Weird, the first time I actual saw a video on Facebook and THEN reddit... say it ain't so.
Know some young doggies like to swang. 
This is not just any swing! It's a public Tony Little Gazelle!
Love how their tails are brushing the ground lol 
nonchalant fluff quad.
Hehe third puppy doesn't want to get its tail in the dirt.
I️ know what I️m gonna watch whenever I️ have a bad day 
Well they seem to have a great day.. 
Welp, my day's fucked. Might as well enjoy this cute quartet on the swings. 
Swinging order 4,3,1,2...and go!
they're pretty smart to be able to figure out how swings work 
This is the best thing I've seen all day 
I wish I was a dog
Swangin...
Looks like it was 2nd puppy's idea to go swing and the other 3 went along just to make him happy.
A new challenger approaches! https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/77e771/dogs_on_the_swing/
Sooo cuuuteeeee
ah this is so cute!

S W I N G Y B O Y E S
Not gonne lie, thought of a different swinging at first.
There so content omfg!
Love 
The Curious, The Derp, The "Mama's Looking!" and The I CBF.
I'll take the one that's behaving correctly..?
that's right, i will sit there and watch them for all day.
That's cute 😘
You can tell the second one is the comic relief of the team. Hes the michelangelo of the team.
i need this panda dog in my life
My heart cannot handle this much cuteness. 
U/kazansama 2 cute 4 me. Cant handle. 
The photographer kills and poses these puppies like that. You can tell because they are all sitting still at the same time. 
Greatest thing ever 
I want the blep!
Their eyebrows make them look angery. Angery puppers.
*floofs. FTFY <3 
I like how their fur patterning makes them look like their angrily enjoying the swing.
How?! Fluffs are so lovely!
You’re in the wrong neighborhood, motherfluffer.
Can someone tell me what kind of swing set this is? I’m trying to imagine how a human would use it..
I was waiting for one to plop on his back
So cute!😃
Alright. Someone perfect loop this and make it my lockscreen
This is literally my favorite thing evar.
They look like pandas
You save my life ,I'm not so upset because someone  now
Superman and General Zod would stop throwing each other into buildings if they stumbled upon this scene.
Newton's cuddle.
3 french hens
Very short gif :(
I want to join that play date
^heck ^^heck heck ^^^^^^heck ^^heck ^^^^heck ^^heck
those are some dank r/rarepuppers
Omg I love the internet
Heck yes
I would lay down on my side on that concrete lot, with my hands on my cheeks, watching these fluffballs swing.
This belongs in r/finnishlapphund :) 
Their little tails brushing the ground ♡
I would do anything for these pups.
Very nice
If I ever saw one of these guys, I might lure them home. Haha
BOOP THOSE SNOOTS
2nd one is getting into it
Experiment result: Swings make 1 of 4 dogs to blop
There's always the one derp...
Well this is adorable 
And and PAW-trige in a pear tree!
Hmnnnnggggggggggggg
What kind of swings are these? I've never seen them before.
Awww... the second one from the left is such a sweaty.
this is why I reddit
I want the floof with cute bleppy tongue
I think we should instead talk about how incredibly nastolgic the swing they are sitting on are. I mean i freaking miss my childhood trips to China, where we would screw around on those swing for HOURS.
It's as though the children from *Village of the Damned* reincarnated as dogs.
Is this on a side walk?
Puppers mutant ninja pups hero’s of a half wag
hello fluffos
How can something look so angry and happy at the same time.
What kind of swing is this? I’ve never seen one like that before.
Very Good... 
Their so cute I've never seen one in person 
2, 3, 1, 4
How do these fluffs not fall off
If this doesn’t melt your heart than I don’t know what will.
Too much cuteness😍😍😍
Third one on the right scares me
Animal abuse 

Four little fluffers, swingin' in a row.
The amount of cute is almost too much to bear.
one of these floofs is not like the fluffers
What kind of puppies they are?😍
Stay swinging, foofers!!!
I would give this 5 stars if I could. GIF of the year.
This frame rate... 
I needed to see this today.
Sauce¿?
This might be the best thing I've ever seen
These Pups are so cute. 
Anyone who sees them will be amazed by them.
Whoa!! TMNT? To the left we have the stoic Loe, to the right of him we have the playful Mickey,  to his right we have the angry "not havin' it" Raff, finally to far right is the lost in thought Donnie!!!
I'm having an emotional day and now I am crying because floofermoofles. 
Wonder how they got them to stay still.
The last and the first one are in sync.
The one with the tongue out looks the best.
I'm sorry, "fluffs" is incorrect. We were looking for "dogs," "doggies," "pups," or "puppies."
Again with the vertical recording. This could've been a cool desktop wallpaper 
Now how does one get 4 puppies to sit still? Especially on a swing? 
awwww so cute 😍😍😍
#FUCK
Pupper with lil blep is a sweetie. I love the lil bashful one turning away on the right ouo
So, you have four of them, huh? Then, would you REALLY notice if one of them came home with me?
A pup in motion stays in motion
will be illegal if I just grab one and run😎😎
This is the best thing I've ever seen. 
From the thumbnail i thought they were Lil Rotties but but the one with the tongue ouuuut aaaaaaaaaa so cute it hurts ;A; love malamutes flufiness
why are they so angry
you came to the right neighborhood motherfucker
Fido's Cradle 
These are our swings, there are many swings like this but this is ours, we are our swings!
I honestly could watch this all day.
omg!!!!!!
How the hell did you get them to do that? 😂
* Meh, so when can I get off ?
* Me gusta!
* Guys, is this safe?
* I just want to go back and sleep.
Someone tell me that there is a stream/twitch of doggies swinging on swings
What is this sorcery? Getting them all to sit still like that.
Cute
20 to 10 this is in Japan.

Swinging puppos
omg! nice environment & nice puppies. I am next. :P
Who ever set this up can accomplish anything. 
As I lay on j bed with my two dogs (Boston terriers) I ask myself why I don’t have four dogs 
Aww I love the one with it's tongue out. It looks so happy to be on the swing.
From now on, their names are: Fluffy, Fluffin, Fluffon and Fluffette.
I love how each one has a clearly distinctive personality. The one with the tongue out lost in happiness is the best.
Which one is your favourite? 😀 
Is this a swingset made for floofballs? Seems it would be terribly uncomfortable for a human.
what breed are those?
"We wait till master is sleeping and then we kill him.  Everybody knows dogs don't like to swing."
Having fun.. guys?
the one with the tongue out is the one I wanna take home and never look back
Easy like Sunday Morning 😅
I actually said AWW out loud when the GIF started. 
SO FLOOFY
This is heaven
I watched this for like 5 minutes straight last night.
I'll just leave this here.

http://gifsound.com/?gifv=6tb3km2&v=6yQzw_1Iflo&s=27
"My moods live on that swing same Push me harder, push me, push me, swang into tomorrow"
Well that's just about as good as it gets
What breed is this????
I looked at this right before I went to bed and had a dream that my cat had eight kittens. 
Looks like a schoolyard photo of the band KISS. 
I wonder how many months of gold gallowboob has
And a bonus r/blop
adorable
Anyone know the breed of dog?
I will be very sad if this post doesn't get the #1 spot of all time, but then i will watch it again and then it will be better 😊
The floopy floof tails
kill me nowwww
Cute and cuddly!
i am just seeing their tails movement for several minutes, OMG so awesome they are.
What type of puppers are these?
This looks like rural China - northern area.  
This may be what you see when you first step in heaven. Puppies on swings, baby elephants playing with a ball, puppies and kittens on a slide (and ducks even)
I wanna swing with them. 
My dog likes to swing too!
I mean....it could be a black metal Album cover
"puppies! Puppies puppies puppies!"

       -- me out loud when i saw this post
Q
Awww so cute >.<
What breed of dog is this?
2 turtle doves
I needed this today.
Doggos of the corn 
Right side: this all you got?
Second from left: derp
Left: you derp
They look like they're about to stop you and ask you to solve a riddle to pass
Only one with its tongue out
Four swinging fluffs, three pampering pats, two fluffy ears, and a super long walk.
This. Is. Everything. 
This is the most adorable gif I've seen in a good while. Take my upvote.
why is the resolution increased by 5x?
The second one will always lead a challenged life.
And one very serious blep.
Could you imagine if those were all quadruplet children? It would turn from cute to horror movie.
Good
HOW CAN ANYTHING BE THIS CUTE?!?  Like seriously, it somehow gets cuter every loop.  
Furry fluff swings and solar panels on the street lights? Is this Utopia? 
They're kinda evil-looking.
I'm not sure why....but this kinda scares me. Just putting that out there.

HOW IN THE WORLD AM I EXPECTED NOT TO UPVOTE 
This deserves more upvotes
What the? it's too cute it's disgusting
sell the second one off to slavery, he seems to be the dumb one
Nice repost.
Should've kicked one as hard as you can and see what happens 
Makes you wonder how South Koreans could even want to eat them in soup.
For some reason I just want to kick one across the street. Does that make me a psychopath?
