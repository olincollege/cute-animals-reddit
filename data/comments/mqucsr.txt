So polite, shaking hands with the shelter staff

His nose is a heart!
Hope that he will live a happy doggo life from now on.
She's reaching over like "Hey! I'm on this side of the counter!" bless her and her <3 shaped nose

Awwwww ❤️
Do dogs know they're being adopted or what that means? Are some of them just happy to go somewhere or do some get terrified?
You know he's happy to be adopted when you see him smiling. Also it's impossible not to adopt this wonderful doggo.
Dude I’m outtie. It’s been a blast but I never wanna come back here 🥰🐶
Why am I crying right now lol.
You can tell that's one happy pupper!
I wish I can adopt all of them. Cute little things. They are so happy and grateful.
I remember bringing home my 2 year old rescue about a year and half ago. She had a huge smile on her face when we were leaving and I’d never seen a dog so excited when she realized I was putting her in the car. First thing she did when we got home was lay on the couch and cuddle up next to me. Your bringing home a friend that loves you more than anything.
Polite doggo handshakes to say “thank you for your service, now I am off to my kingdom”
If you're wondering what song this is, it's [Send Me on My Way](https://youtu.be/IGMabBGydC0) by Rusted Root.
Oh my goodness, what a sweet dog.
“Fuck yeah I’m gettin adopted! High five!!”
I love this so much!!!!
"yes hello, I would like to purchase one hooman, and 3 pawshakes, thank you"
Holy shit, Hoke Co Animal control?
Never thought I’d see Raeford, NC on reddit!
A million upvotes for this happy doggo, and I’m a cat gal. 🤍
/r/ExpressiveDogs
it's very nice to see older pups getting adopted into caring families. Older dogs need some love too!

He got a little heart shaped nose.
Awww😍 this sweet darling deserves the best.
Ugh thanks now I want to adopt a dog
THE LITTLE HIGH FIVE HAND SHAKE THING AHHH HE'S SO PROUD OF HIMSELF "Thank you Jeremy I won't be seeing you again"
Cute! Looks like a pit mix, but I'm not sure what with.
not much on r/aww actually makes me aww but this...  this right here :')
He looks like he wants to go back, and I don't mean that in a bad way, I just think he must have grown attached to the staff at the shelter.
I can’t stop watching this. We adopted our cat. He hissed at us for two weeks, but he’s good now. ❤️
People need to stop breeding dogs
Have you ever...cried immediately
Love his heart nose!
Such a sweetie
Good luck in your new home 🏚
I see why. What a cutie
"I'm goin' home for good! Thank you guys for all the love and treats!"
Who wouldn't want a puppers with a heart shaped sniffer?
Wow this has me ready to cry happy tears. I love this pup 😭😭
OMG such a happy and amazing dog !!
HIS LITTLE HIGH FIVE I CANT 😍😍😍
These adoption posts are making me so jelly! I can't adopt a pet at the current moment, but plan to later on.
I honestly thought this was a tik-tok with some cartoon audio dubbed over it at first
his snoot looks like a heart!
This reminds me of a story from my friend. 

He had this Boxer that he was forced to get rid of, so he took it to an animal shelter. And funnily enough, the son of the shelter owner ended up taking a liking to him, so they were just like "well, I guess he's ours now."
We have a little rescue. We adopted her when she was under a year old and she's nearly eight now! Best dog ever! She's a staffy and was literally a day away from being put down but these days she spends her time eating, sleeping and playing with anyone she looks at.

She was in a pretty bad way when we adopted her, had some cuts on her ears and had infections in them for months afterwards and they couldn't give us any information on her previous home so we don't know where she came from, but she's the best dog in the world!
"Bye bye hooman *shakes hand* im going to my forever home now! I'm so excited!"
Why does that adoption center look so similar to the one from Lilo and Stitch
Looks like someone is going to have to keep food off the counters.

&#x200B;

That is one cute doggo, though :)
I would like more videos of dogs getting adopted plzz
Adopter just hit the jackpot. What a charmer!
Why do we say they are smiling? This is a response to stress
This is the pure, uncut stuff

Be responsible
Ahhhh!!!! so cute! He definitely knows he’s going to a new home
Aw their little nose is heart shaped ❤️
I wanna see more!! What’s this dog doing now? What was the first thing he did after getting to his new home? How much fun has he been having? So many unanswered questions!!
The heart nose... the lil high five... the music... yes, this here is an extremely **High Quality Doggo**
I would literally die for this dog.
I love how the doggie scoots closer to her new owner at the end. You is my person.
Dog is like “High 5 I’m outta here!”
Thank you u/Thund3rbolt for sharing Riley's moment with everyone. I’m Riley’s dog mom! Check out Riley's adventures with her fellow dog and horse friends by following @alexisp.eventing on IG 🥰 #adoptdontshop
doggo  shook the hand like: hecc yes i am getting adopted!
Que linduraaa 😍😍😍
Shelter dogs can always tell when they’re going to their forever home, I mean look at that smile!

Do you think dogs know what adoption is? Do you think they understand that a human picked them to go home and have the good life with? These videos make me think they do.
Shelter animals realizing they are being taken by a new owner is the best video content and wont stop making me cry.
Dogs don’t smile.  Nor do dolphins.
Sweep puppers! Please make sure you pick up and remove its poop & bags of poop from our parks...its getting worse
Hey buddy - you’re going home!
I'm not crying you're friggin crying
That’s ah good booi
I'm not crying. You are!
I wish she would adopt me
**cute**
Awww <3
Oh my his nose markings are a heart 😍
I hope the dog go is happy in their new home
The cutest thing I saw this year!
What a beautiful dog <3 going on to live a happy life.
Oh..my heart is melting 😥🥺

“And never come back!”
Ooh Lucky dog!

Couldn’t have picked a better song for him to go home to
So cute

Hope that little luck dragon brings that lady the same joy over many more years.

Great smile
So cute!! And their nose is shaped like a heart.
That’s a happy dog!
He knows!! So precious...
I want to watch more!
What a beautiful video!  New mama will have that to treasure forever. Such a lovely dog.
I want to adopt a dog so badly, just have to work around apartment nonsense.
My heart!! :D
How do the doggos know they’re getting adopted? 
I find that very interesting about animals
I'd say its a very lucky owner adopting this little guy. Can see he has the nature of a saint. Going to be a beautiful relationship this one.
Dog- “it’s been a pleasure sir” *lick*
The little heart nose
Lovely!!
So damn cute
\*Sheltto Doggo
I completely understand the little heartbreaking sound the camerawoman is making at the end.
God bless you… Congratulations… He has a heart for a nose… Smooch that pooch😘❤️
LOOK AT HIS HEART SHAPED NOSE!!!!!
I always wonder, how much these animals understand of the situation when they are beeing adopted
Good stuff
Look at my happy happy guy 

oh just a happy happy happy guy

oh just a look at that happy oh happy dog

well just a happy a happy happy
What a good boy!
"Goodbye forever! I'm going home!"
Canine to human high fives are the best.
Ok, sitting at my desk crying.  What a sweet baby.  He and his new mommy both looked stoked.  

Happy tears!
I looked up how many dogs were in shelters. I think the number was approximate, but I really fucking wish I didn't do that. Every dog needs a home, every dog needs love.
This made me tear up. Every dog deserves to be that loved and happy.
Damn that really cheered me up! Thanks for posting this.
He’s a DOGE
Dog has heart ❤️ nose. Precious
'His name is stitch'
Aww, that’s a good boy 🥰🤍 this makes me happy. I can tell they’re both so excited to have each other. I’m glad he got the happy ending he deserved.
I adopted a cat after my 14yo cat passed away. I was looking around the shelter and suddenly see this little cat in deep sleep. I poked his head and he wakes up, then gets really excited by meowing at me like: "Are you adopting me???” The shelter said they never seen him this excited. His eyes reminded me of my 14yo cat.

He runs the house now. He's a very lovable cat and a brat. ♥️ Animals are amazing.
Such a goodest boi!
What a good doggie.
It's hard not being sweet when your nose is heart-shaped...
You've got a sweet buddy for life!.
I love him
I should get a dog...
Best thing you’ll see today!!
It's almost scary he is so damn smart. Good luck to the little guy and the new family.
I wonder, does anyone bring their adopted dogs to visit their old shelter caretakers, just to say hi?
Sometimes I wish I went to a shelter over a breader
he is a real happy one
Cute better get love!
Awww
P
What a good doggo. 😍😍
They found each other :)
What a little love.
There is little that brings me more joy in my day than to see one of our homeless critters getting adopted
Heart shaped nose too. He’s got it all ! 10/10 good catch !
Well that is amazingly heartwarming! Thanks for sharing! 💕💕
*rings bell* “One mommy, please.”
Can dogs actually smile though?
Now imagjne if we did this for all the animlas in the shelter
Hey throw couple cans of Alpo in the bag, would you?  -Doggo
Perfect song being played as well!
I'm not crying you are!
The Matilda music is very appropriate
this one made my eyes sweaty <3 <3 <3
Cute
They know ❤️
Awww she's so sweet!
“Can I borrow two dollars?”
Doggo nose looking like a heart ♥️ so precious
Awww the doggo is so cuteeeee
Nose
This song is super fitting. It also played at the end of Matilda when Matilda got adopted.
MY HEART
This looks like my dog, do you have anymore photos?
The heart nose tho...
That heart-shaped nose!
This is so heartwarming. Made my day
This makes me smile. A LOT.
Her nose is shaped like a heart I’m in love
Also her nose is sort of shaped like a heart! Awe!!
This is beautiful.
He has a heart noseeee 🖤🖤🖤
Humans don't deserve dogs, except for the very best, most incredible humans.
Tears 🥲🥲🥲
He's got a love heart snoot. It's so boopable. 🖤 🥺
I need a whole reddit with only posts about dogs getting adopted
Such a good dog!
I'm not crying... you're crying ;-;
Aw and it has a little heart for a nose! So precious!
Scenes like this make me wonder how much the dog understands what is actually going on.
Take all of my upvotes!
Awww that smile!
2 things. 1 that is so cute i can't handle it. 2 now that song is in my head.
I could not love this any more than I do!
And the dogs nose looks like a heart
omg he deserves all the good things!
This makes me want a dog so bad
And he moves over to his new owner!!! I love this so much!
Im ok with every aww clip having this song in the background but maybe without the fucking sub bass kick added in.
Having a doggo has changed my life like I couldn't believe.
Awesome!!
If I had a dollar for every “feel good” video with this song in it...
Came here for the “we don’t deserve dogs” comments
What breed of dog is this??
He is ADORABLE!
/u/savevideo
Plot twist, he’s getting “adopted” by the shelter
That smile brightened up the world
OKay, crying a little at how happy this little guy looks...he know he's going home today = )
He's like "Fuck yeah bitch i got adopted"
What a sweetheart.
Shelter doggo is ready for a new adventure and a place to call home 🥰💖
I love his heart nose!💕👅💕
Looks like a Brittany Spaniel mix, there is no better dog than a Brittany. They are super smart and affectionate.
My heart 🥺🥺🥺
You made me fucking cry
Look at that heart nose! 🥲
So cute. 😻
🐾❤️❤️❤️🐾
Such a cutie pie
Walking down the a busy city sidewalk, scrolling through Reddit and I just started tearing up....
Awwwwwwwwww ps I want all dogs
he got a heart shaped snoot to boot

She probably thinks she's going for a walk!
Dog: "Thank you kind temporary hoomans. I have my forever hooman and forever home. Come visit sometime but bring belly scritches"
We don't deserve dogs....
We really don't deserve dogs
Look at the heart-shaped nose
This song + any dog = big smiles from me
That high five expressed genuine emotions!
I want a house so bad. I can’t wait to adopt a dog, living in an apartment is hard to have two dogs.
How sweet
He’s nervous
Oh he is precious
Cute dog, I want that dog.
Top good boy
Anyone have an idea on what breed this happy puppy is? I'm not certain but the ears make me think it's a spaniel mix
Pitt bull Jack Russell mix?
That makes me think of when my wife and I adopted our dog Hank last year. He's a Bassett Hound/Labrador mix so he looks like a Lab with stubby Bassett Hound legs. When we were adopting him people who worked there walked by and they'd say to him, "Hank the Tank! You're getting adopted!?" They were so excited for him.
Awe cute
R/Amonguscockbot
Doggy fist bump!
Brings so much joy to my heart ❤💙💜💖
"Im leaving with this human!! you watching?!! I choose this one!!"
Such goodness and happiness.
He was like “give me some daps before I leave, you were a real one”
This is awesome 😎
Such a good boy!
Nice
i dont know which one is more fuckable the girl or the dog
Made me cry
The heart on her happy nose! This type of video never gets old.
u/farmercurtis his nose is a fucking heart!!!!!
i cant wait till i move out and am financially stable enough to give my doggo a good life. would def adopt :)
Ugh what a cutie.
Adorbs. Enjoy the ride you two! 🙂
What’s the name of this song??
The dog is cute and all but like what do you with your hand that has dog spit on it (i’m not a dog owner)
I needs to see more of this doggo and his new life
Mine was so scared when I took her home. She didn’t want to leave her brothers and sisters. She had very little socialization. When she first saw me she barked . LOUD! They kept saying “you’re going to a better place”

And now she’s next to me chewing on her bone. She always come check on me when I take her in the dog park. She’s my best friend.
That girl is very lucky!!!
His nose looks like a heart :)
Honestly after having two dogs in my life. One who past recently sadly. I can firmly say that Dogs and Cats are way more aware of what's going on than they let on. I personally think they only reason they don't drop the charade is because they think we won't play with them as much as we do. I'd still take them out to grass and run around with them until they are tired.
I could watch this all day. This dog gives me such a joy.:)
Finally some good fucking news
This is what i like to sew :)
Do old grandpa dogs ever go to shelters and such? That’s the type of dog I’d like. I want to love the shit out of an old grandma or grandpa dog when I’m able to.
That puppies scores super high in agreeableness
I'm not crying, you're crying!!
Love!
This is so precious.
His little nose is shaped like a heart. So precious
Looks happy to be out of a cage for once
His/her doggo nose looks like a heart! 🥺🖤
More, please. I need it.
So is this it, when you hit 30 you just cry happy tears randomly, is that a thing. Its been happening to me since my 30th birthday lol
I love seeing these.

Brings some light at a time when I am struggling.

Best of everything to both.
Thank you for taking care of me.  I’m going home with my new mommy now.
💛💛💛😍
Such a sweetie ❤️
Made me smile and audibly “aww”
He’s got an extra heart nose
What a sweet baby 😍

Aww this makes me remember when I picked up my dog from the Humane Society. She fell asleep in my lap on the way home. Although my dog pretended to be a sweet little angel until she entered her new home.
His nose, shaped like a ❤
Thank you for helping me find the perfect human!
Trop cute !

When I adopted my dog many years ago, he was afraid to leave the shelter and threw up on my lap during the ride home. It was the start of a beautiful relationship.
Why she not wearing mask tho
Man I wish I was as happy as that dog looked. 🤔
Please return this dog to the shelter immediately!

....so I can adopt it! So cute!!!
u/SaveVideo
I'm not a dog person so pardon my ignorance. How do dogs know they are being adopted? I see that they are happy but do they know they have a new master? What's the difference in me taking a dog from the shelter for a walk vs. taking the dog home.
This is so sweet🥺🥺♥️
This makes me so happy
Yes!!!!
Cute
❤️
He’s a good boiii
Aww so cute 🥰
He’s a good boy. I want a dog, my apartment isn’t very big, it would t be fair to a dog. I work too much, dogs are great. ☺️
That’s an awesome dog right there
this made my fuckin day
so precious omg
Ok this is officially too much cute for me. Im out
We got our two rescues as wee pups, and I want to go home and pet their fuzzy heads right now.
Doggo :)
So sweet 🥲😌
Wow. I love this guy. What an adorable personality. <3
little heart nose! boop!
Damn, did not expect to tear up.
And a heart nose!
u/savevideo
Cute
The shelter I look at usually, (as-in: always,) has about 10 pages of dogs. And that's just the 'Large Dogs'. And anywhere from 10-15 pages of cats.

Now, they have one page each, with around three animals in each.

I almost dread when things really get back to normal, and the flood of dogs that are going to come back in.
OMG😭thank you for making him soooo happy😭
Adopting from a shelter is seen as a greater “risk” than it really is. We adopted from our local humane society, and they really made sure it was a good fit before allowing us to adopt. We were even allowed to bring our other two dogs to the shelter for a meet and greet/play date  before adopting, just to make sure the three got along well. At most shelters, they are well educated and care about the animals.
Every dog deserves to smile like that
Ugh all of these make me want a dog. That poop is a problem though.
awwwwww
Nice
Awwww!🥰
Because all doggo's want to do is be good boi's
and people say dogs don’t know what’s happening around them
look at this distinguished gentleman
That face. Some of our best dogs were mutts from shelter. This post made me a bit happy today. Nice.
This is the best thing I've seen all day. Thank you, internet
*Goodbye, thank you for all that you've done for me.*
Cue the music...this ones going on reddit
Listen to the music. It is similar to Zelda Ocarina of Time shop music. Incredible.
So cute
*gets home and then pisses all over the floor* Its good to be home
Her nose looks like a heart! ❤️
If that doesn’t put a smile on your face i don’t know what will.
That song just brings me back to ice age one...
He looks so happy. This melted my heart.
Ugh this dog is just too damn cute! Glad he or she got adopted!
“Doggo”
Dogs happiness is so freaking contagious
This brought me to tears.
Love a happy doggo :)
Sweet dog
So cute... now I’m a bit sad I gave my wholesome award away before seeing this 💙
so happy!
His lil heart nose!!
Swell little Pooch
When you take adopted dog back to shelter to visit staff friends, is he scared like when going to vet or happy that he'll see his human friends?
The music had me primed for a montage I never got.
Man, I wish I had the time for a dog 😭
You can tell the doggo already loves them
Omg that's so cute. I'm so glad this dog is going to a good home
BRB gonna hug my dog again.
i adopted a shelter dog who was a rude spoiled brat. i love visiting shelter dogs though so i found her the right home and might try again
I love dogs

Good dog.
Too much
How did that sweet pup end up in a shelter? The fuck is wrong with people? He’d never get out of my arms much less to a shelter.
Rescue animals are always the most grateful ❤️
They know!😭 🥰
be always happy doggo
Dogs know
There is no love like the love you receive from a rescue

Sweet puppers
Hey this was at my local shelter!
How did HAPPY Chops  end up there in the first place. ♦️
Heart nose!
Happy for them both!
Finally a real adoption unlike other posts where it’s just a picture of the dog/cat in the cage.
It’s nose looks like a heart!
I’m pissing
He has so much love some of it has to stored on his face🥺
Unrelated question: anyone know who makes that jacket that the adopter is wearing?
The matching human smile makes me feel good about this pair
Doggo has a heart nose!

Little baby has a heart nose ❤️
My dog was a "regular" with the shelter, kept getting returned, so the leaving part he just was super excited. We adopted a second dog from them several months later and wanted to make sure they would get along. I swear they understand English cause we explained we were going to meet a new friend and we might take her home if they like each other etc. He totally got it and put his front paws on the counter like that to say hi to the workers and they were so happy to see him doing so well. We got to adopt her cause they were so happy together and it's just the most fun thing to remember and how happy the staff was to know that our dogs are loved and love each other.
His nose is a heart.
Shelter animals deserve ALL the pets and kindness
Omgggosh I think this is what my puppy is going to look like !
Awww🥺

Too beautiful, thank you!

He has a heart shaped snoot . I love him
He has a heart shaped nose. Lmao. How he lasted more than a day at the kennel is beyond me.
i know exactly why i am crying in the club right now
Ahh! Working at a shelter would be so amazing. I just wish they paid their employees.
Its so wholesome I don’t know what to say
Our border collie acted like this when we adopted him.  He was so excited.  Running around the shelter and then to us.  Chatting away kind of like how this dog does in the video.  More people need to adopt.
If you're having a bad day this is exactly the thing that will turn it into a good day.
Fuzzy face is happy 😊 yayyyyyy!
Happy doggo
The doggos new human looking down at doggo with pride and joy :’) I wish these two friends an amazing journey together.
Why did I see this posted on twitter without the annoying music?
What do you guys think of people who demand owners to “get rid of “ their shelter- saved animal?
Videos like op’s help me remember that there are so many people without feeling
It’s so hard to adopt a shelter dog... my fiancé and I are both doctors and we are never heard back from any shelter. At this point we gave up and are just gonna buy a puppy.
Its enough to make a grown man cry
Dogs are better than humans. Hands down
Its like he knows exactly whats happening. "Its been real folks but I'm outta here!"
Oh wow, such happy 😁
I just know it as the end song to Matilda
I love how people say they "adopted" a dog from a shelter or better yet "rescued" them.  They're practically giving them away at shelters, free dogs. (One of my favourite Bill Burr bits)  This guy is pretty adorable, though.
Ugh my heart ❤️
Ill never understand how a dog like this ends up in a shelter.
Looks like a pit/Pyrenees mix. Good doggo.
This was the first longhaired pitbull I've seen and he/she is beautiful!!
Priceless! 🐾❣️
You Luck Dragon is a bit small to be flying on.
Awww...I LOVE this!!
Watched it twice
I hope with all my heart that he is going to kind, patient people!!
I will steal that dog.
Heart nose 💜
Omg happy pupo
😃
what song is that?
She knows she’s the lucky one to have this doggo and not just the other way around
Dogs are the greatest
Oh! That smile! So pure!
Doggos being happy will never not bring a huge smile to my face.
If he were a cat, he would be completely unresponsive and drop the act immediately after.
Animals can definitely when happy.
Just awesome. ❤️
Carlos
Send him on his way!
The music is PERFECT
😭Such a beautiful doggy, I'm so happy for him!🥰
I’m not crying, you’re crying!!
I'm busy so I omly watched it 11 times.
I love her 😍
COVID exists BTW.
Dogs don't smile.  You're doing a disservice to yourself and your pets if you anthropomorphize them.
Lil heart nose!
Excellent baby!
"This is my momma now, she's taking me home. Thank you for the playdate, I love you"
Aw🥺🥺🥺
She pawsed to say thanks! Good doggo!
If this doesn't give you all the feels. Then you don't have a heart. You also don't deserve a dog .💕
That little heart nose! 🖤
I want to thank everyone who says "adopted" instead of "rescued".  That term really annoys me because it seems so self-serving and it's like people say it to get Kudos for being such a great human. But "Adopted" is a nicer term. The doggo is adopted into your family. Much better I think ;)
he has a heart nose.
Doggo has a heart shaped nose!
What a cute little guy!
Dont play that fucking song dude. My heart just cant take it.
Oh my heart!
Made me smile and feel good, thanks for sharing..
Oh. HAPPINESS. Can we see more of this precious baby booper???
Hell yeah you love to see it! Adopt don't shop
Man if I we're to see a doggo like that getting adopted I would be sad and happy. Because I mabye wouldn't see em again and happy because he found a home
Love it, once again please adopt don't shop, There are so many dogs sitting in shelters it breaks my heart for all those people who just want to buy the latest trendy cross breed puppy, please reconsider and  check out your local animal shelter first
Odd i think i ate a dog similar to that, it just kept smiling
This video made my day
Aw such a good boy shaking
I got a shelter dog a few years back. He was older and when they brought him out, he had a muzzle on, which probably should have been a sign but they said he just had some issues with certain dogs and would be fine. Our first walk out, I realized there was a major issue. He aggressively went after every dog he saw. So we did a training class, and got kicked out the first day. He was barking non stop and trying to go after the other dogs which interrupted their progress. So I did private training and they slowly tried introducing him to other dogs, but he was too far gone. The trainer told me he was probably a wild pack leader before the shelter got him. It absolutely broke my heart having to give him back. Alone with me, he was the sweetest dog in the world. I called almost daily to check on him and see if he found another home and they eventually told me he found a home on a farm away from other dogs, so I hope he’s happy now.
I teared up when he put out his little paw. Congratulations on being adopted doggo ❤
His nose looks like a heart and I love it
We don't deserve dogs
Everyone looks so happy and excited!! Great stuff.

My mini aussie does that with his paws when he's excited and I love it so much. What a happy looking pup!
He's like "give me your hand, bestie"
Dogs make my heart melt and my eyes well up with tears.  They’re such loving and amazing creatures.  He was so cute when he extended his paw, saying yes, I’ll miss you too, thank you for taking care of me.  What a sweet happy baby❤️❤️❤️

The unconditional love they give, they truly are man's best friend. We just said goodbye to our four legged family member. He gave us just over 10 years of pure happiness. Lost him to lung cancer. RIP Bobby <3

Videos like this always tear me up I lost my big little girl to cancer at 15 years old just at Christmas time there and every time I see videos like this I’m always happy for the owners because I’m glad they’re getting the same happiness my girl gave to me for 15 years and I loved every second of her.
I hate this fucking song
This is the cutest thing I have seen today. So cute and polite
Rescue pups are the best. Ours has been amazing and so chill. Perfect compliment for my 3 kiddos.
