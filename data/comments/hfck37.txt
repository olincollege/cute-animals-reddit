Reminds me of a story my dad told me about a farm cat he had. It lived to be 20 years old and for an outdoor farm cat that's ancient. I asked how did the cat end up dying in the end? "Oh a cow rolled over on him when he was laying down in the shade." Every time I see an animal flop down near a cat this story comes to mind.
"no friend. that is not how you do a snuggle. this how you do a snuggle."
‚ÄúU almost crushed me wit ur big fl√∂√∂f but i still luv u‚Äù
‚ÄúDude, wtf? I was almost crushed! I can‚Äôt believe you- wait a minute. Stay there. Ok, this worked out. Good move, dawg‚Äù
What I love is that the dog knows the cat won't move so they sit where its best for them.
I miss my cat üòû
Nice touch how it ends with them both looking toward the camera.
Am I the only one that left childhood (and cartoons) thinking cats and dogs hate each other only to be cold water shocked when i see they can actually get along.
Not entirely unexpected.  A cat in this situation is going to only act two different ways.  Either the pup is going to get a whack to the nose with the claws out and the cat takes off or ... the cat is just going to shrug kitty shoulders and curl up on the dog like a pillow and go to sleep.

These are the only two cat logic answers in this situation.
If I fits I s-NO WAIT
Best friends forever.
No one, I repeat, no one, can get mad at a Golden
Heart warming! Those two are the sweetest ü•∞
**CATS AND DOGS**

**LIVING TOGETHER**

**MASS HYSTERIA**
"Now let's see how you like it when I plop my butt on *you!*"

It's not very effective...
Cat:  oh, good, my bed heater arrived.
Ohhh they‚Äôre both so beautiful!
Proof that we can work it out. Beautiful! Everyone must see this.
My youngest cat cuddles with my pittie. I always thought cats and dogs hates eachother. Mine are all so dependent on eachother for different needs.
r/kittypupperlove would like this!
Beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
Watched it twice. So sweet.
sooo cute!!
Literally the most expected outcome on this sub
How can anyone see this video and not smile....this warms my ice cold heart. üê∂üíïüê±üíï
Forgiveness 
(& cuddles) 
a basis of a beautiful relationship
Awww best buddies !!!

My happiness goes up two points when I see a dog cuddling with a cat.
[Dogs and cats cuddling are my favorite](https://i.imgur.com/9PTi5sL.jpg)
What is wrong with you? https://i.imgur.com/VmnFOfX.png
So cute... the kitty cat obviously trusts dogs ü•∞üêàüêï
Aaww sweet floofenshmoofs
F O R G I V N E S S
Aww, that's how you know kitty loves its dog.
"Dude, we can cuddle if you want, but i'm on TOP."
Why does the dog look so sad ü•∫
_heavy inhale_
BOI 
This was cute...
So precious!
I don't blame that cat.  I wish I could cuddle with a dog now that we're in lockdown.
So precious! Love how the cat laid back down despite being sat on.
Mass hysteria.
how is this unexpected, this happens all the time
My cat does this with me! I'll be laying in bed on my phone, and she'll go under my arm and just snuggle right up- it's adorable... though it admittedly comes up short a dog...
We used to have cats and dogs as pets and this is definitely more common that you‚Äôd think.
Ok, I love this.
Perfect example of a peaceful home!!! Even the pets are in unionism with one another
The cat-dog snuggle, a timeless classic
My heart just melted!!!
Hello Kitty!
I felt that! But you‚Äôre a gracious kitty. Have a sweet sleep üí§
Animals are amazing! So sweet
My cat would just leave and be like "fuck this I'm out, you can keep the bed".
This video makes me feel strange. Are these emotions?
Now I want to get a cat and a dog and train the cat to take care of the dog
This reminds me of when I was little and my dog sat on my face while i was sleeping but Bc I was young I could not get him off so I he was on my face all night
Snuggle time ‚ù§Ô∏è
So wholesome.
Well Goldens are made of fluff and fluff and fluff and luv. who wouldn't snuggle. Can confirm, I have a golden.
"On the one hand, he is annoying... on the other hand... he's warm, soft and fluffy."
Great. Now I need a dog AND a cat.
When it's never going to happen but you still give each other the affection each other lacks
If it fits, it sits. Prrrrr
‚ÄúI will spare you, but only this once.... or twice... or maybe three times‚Äù
*Oi, ya big oaf! Yer lucky I love ya!*

*I really love ya, pal.*
SHE FITS PERFECTLY OMG THATS JUST SO GOD FUCKING CUTE
I grew up thinking that dogs and cats hate each other (I never had pets). But videos on the internet have really changed my perspective on the relationship between these two animals.
I‚Äôm crying this is sooooo cute.
Venkman tried to warn us.
If it barks it parks.
Crying tears of cuteness üò≠
"Oh no your sitting on me. But it's ok I forgive you. I know you don't know your own size"

     Cat probably.
Ahhh this is the sweetest thing!! :) I've got all the warm fuzzies right now.
"Smell my bum whilst you sleep, you're welcome!'
hugging and sitting next to smol friends
Awww so sweet
Serious question: when a cat or dog shoves its butt on you, it is showing affection, right? 

I read somewhere that that‚Äôs why people wake up to their cat‚Äôs bum. I‚Äôve never had this experience before so I don‚Äôt know.
\[Everybody liked that\]
Unexpected? Is this OP's first day on reddit or something?
Anyone who owns a golden and a cat isn't surprised at all
Is there a subreddit for cats and dogs being cute together ?
It‚Äôs enough to make a grown man cryü•∫
Honestly all I want in life is a cat and dog that love each other like this
I don't have a lot of hope for my future, but I do hope to one day have a chill dog and cat that hang out like this.
I just got a kitten that loves falling asleep against or across my dog, but my six years old dog only allows it because she‚Äôs already asleep or too lazy to move. Any other time of the day, the dog is very obviously tolerating the kitten. I hope they are cuddle buds like this one day!
This looks cozy af
I love Golden Retrievers and their stupid little eyebrows
I thought the dog was going to get bitch slapped. I'm sorry I prematurely judged you, kitty.
For a sec I thought I was about to witness something from r/AnimalsBeingJerks. I'm glad it's not :')
Can we ever experience what it's truly like to be a cat or a dog for just even a minute? 5 seconds? If possible, would that psychologically crush someone?
Nap time?

Nap time.
Dogs put their full weight on you when they trust you
That dog's eyebrows are killing meee! 
This was SO sweet!! I dont even like cats but that one seemed so cool and its meowing is actually so adorable
Not for me. Saw it coming a mile away I did.
Who doesn‚Äôt need a cuddle?
Hey, don't sit on me, it should be the other way around!
an absolute DUMP truck
I love how they fit together so perfectly! ü•∫
Makes me want to get my cats a dog. ;)
i had to check the sub name to anticipate what kind of unexpected i was getting into
‚ÄúA surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.‚Äù
My cat would do that
So sweet!
Even though my own boys üê∂üê± get along well I‚Äôve never seen them curl up to each other like that so I‚Äôm kinda jealous ü•∞
Anyone who has. Cats and goldens knew the outcome. They love each other more than anything.
Too cute for real life.
Absolutely precious
That is the absolute best thing I could see as I lay me down to sleep.
If doggo fits, I sits
This reminds of the dog and cat my Dad had around the house in the early 00's. They were both outside animals and every afternoon, the dog, a lab mutt would lie in the driveway soaking up the sun. Dad's cat would come up after Jolie got settled and get in position as the little spoon. They would do this everyday all summer long for a couple of hours each day. If you were driving up, you'd have to drive around them cause they weren't giving up their spot.
‚ÄúAh I still luv ya, ya big luv‚Äù
‚ÄúAww, I love you too, ya big stupid lummox.‚Äù
You don‚Äôt lay on me I lay on you
r/animalsbeingbros
Cat feels safe and warm with dog. Very cute.
aww they're cuddling
My dogs wouldn't have the courage to come anywhere near my cat. He taught them to fear him.
My golden would do this to our cat. The only difference is that our cat would spend the next 30 minutes cleaning our golden‚Äôs head. He‚Äôd make this deep throated whine in annoyance, but he never moved.
This is like one of my old dogs and our old cat. The most gentle dog and cat you could ever meet, they always used to snuggle together. Such a shame neither of them are here now.
Don't mistake this for love. A new, warm pillow just arrived. That's as far as it goes for the cat.
Whats up with pets always sticking their butts in other's faces when they sit down? Does it give the best POV for them when they rest their heads?
They even kissed haha
Kitty snuggled up even after the dump truck landed
‚ù§Ô∏è
When he plops the cat sounds like she's telling "nooooo".
everyone expects cats and dogs to fight
Awwwww
My heart melted :)
Cats are always looking for something warm to sit against. They are so precious.
Beyond ADORABLE
Democrats and Republicans could learn a lot from this video.
Nothing loves more than our pets!!
I wish my cat and dog would do this
double fluffy
Cuddowl
The look on the dogs face looks tired and he looks like he also feels bad for disrupting his friend. Luckily it worked out in the end.
So cute!
What's the unexpected part? It's well known that every time god makes a golden, god flips a coin. It's either will die drown staring up at the sudden rain stupid, or correcting your tax returns for you while forging your signature smart with nothing in between that gulf. Which ever golden you get, they all can in less than a second optimize a snuggle to everyone's win.
So sweet ‚ù§Ô∏è
If you can‚Äôt beat them join them
‚ÄúYou sit on me?!? No no no No! I sit on you!‚Äù
Treating each other like litter mates, the big floof just doesn't realise exactly how big of a floof it is.
This. This is the content I'm subbed here for.
üòÆ I don't recall giving anyone permission to record my husband and me.
Why do animals smell everything
Wow a heating pad
I think it was trying to get revenge but failed and was like ‚ÄúMISSION FAILED ACT CUTE‚Äù
cat got scared first and then she cuddled with him <3
I love them so much
Oh my god my heart!
Oh to be that kitty.
When the video ended, the cat bit the shit out of the dog.
Cat!
This gives me hot flashes just looking at it.
The seems to walk up and say "ready for bed"??
Still managed to put cat-butt on someone's face
Dog looks surprised at the end, like *usually you‚Äôre an asshole...I guess I had to play your game first for you too respect me*

Meanwhile cat is thinking *must play nice for the camera*
A Roomba, never have to play the flute..
End times-dogs and cats sleeping together.
Dawwwww, they‚Äôre the bestest buds.
They're best friends, this is adorable
Nice cute
How did the hooman not go ‚Äúaweeeeee‚Äù?!
I felt that warmth in my heart !
This made my heart happy
Awww
Sit on me will you?
I sit on you!
This is too precious
If we fits, we sits.
OMG.. My house. And, if lucky, I get one inch of my pillow. Yellow lab and black and white feral here.
wrr
Haha this is Cute. Almost crashed with the booty. LOL

Dogs are boys and cats are girls
Oh cool! A new house. Thanks gary.
This was beautiful.
My heart just completely melted!!
Kitty knows where the bread is buttered.
This is heart warming
This is reddit. We know what's going on
Melt my heart
Muh hart.
Ohhh this is so adorable
Ah shit
 This made me.smile so much
If only all cats knew how cosy dogs can be. And if only all dogs knew how cosy cats can be.
u/vredditshare
does dog poop taste the same as cat poop or is it saltier?
I wonder if animals understand that size difference like we do. To that cat, that must be like if a city bus was to try and cuddle with us as humans. You'd be freaked out of a thing ten times your size decided to plant its ass on you.
Awwwwww so cute
I love that , my cat and dog do that
Omg my heart melts.
AW THEY LOVE EACH OTHER
This is so cute!!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
That isn‚Äôt a real cat.
Animals deserve to be loved!
The dog has said this is my bed we can share just pick a corner and this was the cats reply . I had a giant Schnauzer that would go outside at night to pee and couldn't get back to bed because our orange male cat would lay on the stairs and not let him pass . I would wake up to a 80 lb dog whining at the bottom of the stairs he won't let me pass . The 60lb mother had no problem .
[removed]
This may be the cutest thing I‚Äôve seen all life
The dog is a paid actor
Dog and cat friendships are especially adoring
So cute in the end
They‚Äôre playing nice in front of the parents
did you see the cats tail?
it does the same thing as a vacuum cleaner when you press the button to get rid of the cable :D :D
Now they can get jerry
‚ÄúDang it doggo, you almost squashed me like some mashed potatoes‚Äù
Coud this count as r/perfectfit ?
@videodownloaderbot
I just love how cats always look back at their owners after as if they want you to be proud of them, so adorable.
This is so sweet!
Damn that can‚Äôt get any cuter!!
Unless the dog was was gonna eat the cat , it was totally expected. Like every sec theres a post dog and cat cuddling it cute ik
Dont get it twisted, the cat tried to suffocat(e) the dog with its floof

That dog is huge
It's like she slid into his Dm's.
LOOOL, this reminds me my dog and cat ... :D my dog is not so rude and have respect to cat, but still he let her to go sleep to him.

What was unexpected about this?
Iluv ur kitty‚ù§Ô∏ème buy..
It's a saying that cat and dog are enemies. This is the best examples for humans. If animals can change their rituals why a human can not?
I hate these titles. Lazy and predictable easy titles for internet clout.
That's clearly the dog's bed. The dog didn't looked amused at all. Almost looked like it was pissed at the end!
Does no one else see the cat giving a ‚Äúmaster is watching so I‚Äôm going to play it cool, but I will get you back later you asinine canine! üò°‚Äù face?
