They have a YouTube channel and I swear that dog is the most motherly being under the sun, she's so damn sweet
It melt my heart! The little kiss and look of devotion!
This is Millie! Her owner has two more, huskies, Lola and Rupert. A lovely youtube channel they have!
“This is what my parents did to me... they watched me as a baby until I fell asleep then gave me nose kisses. I must do the same.” -doggo
Dogs are TOO good.
Doggo says "Go get your own baby this ones taken" …. awww
This is so pure! I have a husky cross who just wants to spend all day snuggled up sleeping with you, preferably in bed but he will settle for the sofa. Can't have kids just yet but I can't wait to see him with them, he loves kids 😭
That look and kiss she gave him was adorable! So much love
"Dog refuses..." oh so it's a husky
Looks like Millie has someone to love. 😍
This just made my day
Is there a subreddit just for animals with their tiny humans? This is too sweet
Lol before the kid pushes the dog's paw away you could see the dog slowly inching his paw forward to touch the kid.
Now I want to get a husky
She is so torn between obey the big human and protect the small one
I have 3 huskies and my wife is due to go into labor any day. I really hope they bond with my daughter like Millie has here.
> Doggo refuses

Husky?

Yup, Husky.
That's a big ass dog. Whatchu feeding it?
Bottle of milk in bed is gonna cause problems

Millie! <3 <3 <3
He's just watching over his random treats delivery unit.
Can you imagine how hot it is to have fur and blanket
The kiss! What a good pup
As a full grown man I never thought I’d let out such a high pitched “awww” in the last few seconds of that clip
Big friendly floof
Oh my heart! ❤️
Milpert the Husky
This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship
Ngl this bed looks very comfortable.
Is the dog morbidly obese or is that just a lot of fur?
Awww ❤️
Sweetest thing ever!

Raised by wolves and all.
That child is Mowgli in making.....
That's the cutest fucking dog I've ever seen.
Looking a bit chonky 😂
So loyal.
aww! thats so wholesome
my heart 🥺
Those damn onions
What a couple of sweet creaures
literally my damn husky until we get out of bed in the morning
That look the doggo gives the kid is everything
Not really sure what’s cuter: the doggo, the kid, or the dude’s accent & laugh 🤣❤️
What a good girl.
Big friendly floof
is so cute❤️❤️❤️❤️
Thats a chonk dog
I want to be that kid
Millie, atta girl darling!! You’re the sweetest thing!!
I love it! We’ve had our oldest dog since my daughter was 2. She’s a tween now and the dog still sleeps in her bed and watches over her like this. She thinks my daughter is her kid lol
Find someone that looks at you the way this dog looks at that baby and never let them go.
Ohhhh so sweet.  She twitches with an automatic reaction to "come" but is overridden but mind and emotion saying, "Stay right here and look after the baby".
How can anyone downvote this?? I just want the answer from that 7 % of people who downvoted it!!
Thanks for posting this ray of sunshine! 💖
I love their YouTube channel. Really melts my heart

Aww!
Oh COME ON this is so precious I can’t even take it.🥺
Thats a lifelong friendship right there

Doggo has his priorities straight 😻
How cold is that room,  that you need to tuck a Husky in
Ok time for me to go get a dog now
This is so adorable that dog is so lovely. I was afraid of how my moms pitbull would be with my son because he is used to our mini poodle, so I waited until he was almost a year to introduce him, but that dog....he’s this massive old  pit bull with the energy of a puppy but when I took my son into the room, he immediately sat down, ears went back and he gently
Licked my son feet and hands and left him be! Dogs really are so amazing.
This last frame looks like a painting... so pure.
This is MY puppy.
We don't deserve dogs man.
If that’s not the sweetest thing my own two eyes have ever shown me, I don’t know what is
I need that dog.
Too precious. Must protect.
Best boy.
I wish I could get a dog :(
Omg my heart hurts, it's too cute
What a sweet girl. “No, I must guard the tiny human. It is my duty.”
What a cute doggo
The goodest of good boys!!!!!
What a precious girl she is
Milly and Rupert
Part of the pack
after seeing this my heart is now biggest organ in my body
Adult human now sleeps in the kitchen on the floor
That’s a chonky boi
I have NEVER seen a husky that husky.
That dog does a better job of mothering than most mothers
Angels come in all forms
Huskies are the best dogs.
This video is super cute but i cant stress enough how this is obviously a badly kept dog. A husky should never be this overweight they are sled dogs and demand ALOT of excercise and this one is clearly not getting enough.

I know we all just really come here to aaaw look at the cute animals but in the long run the only thing that matters is taking care of the animal if you can't do it properly dont get one...

EDIT: Been informed that this is a mix between Husky and Malamute therefore it's heftier size so i was probably wrong about this one. Don't wanna delete or change the original comment to invalidate the replies.

Thanks for the info BrianstormIRL!
> refuses the owner to get out of bed

And all they had to do was literally put the dog in the bed, cover it up, and wait 45 minutes while filming him. Such an organic moment!
I loved this video.
We don’t deserve animals
That is a very unhealthy dog.
Oh look another staged dog gif.
cute
I hardly ever run as I fear tripping up, but damn... I ran downstairs to show this to my mum!! 😍
Dog*
I would puke if my dog ever laid or even got on my bed... his level of slobber 🤤
Why is your dog so overweight? Why do people let their working dogs get this fat? Do you never walk it or something?
Leaving animals and small children together is dangerous for both the animal and the child.
It’s enough to make a grown man cry, and that’s ok

Im glad I saw this. Made my day!
The loyalty and love dogs gives us, simply amazing. We are not worth it
😍😍😍
God damn the feels
Awww too cute!
That is precious. Thanks for sharing!
OMG how cute
My dog gives me the exact same look when he steals my pillow to sleep on. Go out to pee for 1 minute, and he's right smack in the middle of it when I come back. He'll think I'll do an exception this time too.
The law over the kid looks set up but I don’t care.  Very sweet.
God they love is so much...
C U T E AF
That’s the cutest fucking thing that I’ve ever seen
Okay, that is so friggin adorable it's not even funny.

The dog is jealous but still a bit scared while as well being surprised and wonder what it is
My heart can’t deal with the cuteness
“Billy! Come!” *gets more comfortable*
Omg I love Huskies there so sweet I have never meet a Husky that wasn't friendly. My miniature husky mix gets a little grumpy some times but he's still my little buddy.
Anecdotal experience having huskies growing up....they're hyperactive and need a lot of space but damn are they good with children.  Patient and protective.
What the fuck? I’m so happy.
This made my day!
My dog is also named Millie and this is big Millie energy right here.
The cut to them looking at each other was so cute
I like how he keeps looking back like “are you still here?”

Malamutes are the best!!!!!
Dogs know they were bred for this. They are the protectors of humanity.
That is a fat-and-happy dog if I've ever seen one 😊

I love fat and chubby huskies
Heart is like a stone for everyone.But after seeing this everyone's heart will  melt like a ice cube.
Now imagine someone bullying the kid
He protect he protect and most importantly he protect
Man this really makes me miss my little buddy.
And people say morality isn’t innate.
Aw. That's Adorable. BFF'S
She had that look on her face that momma animals get when they're with their babies. You know the one? It's a peaceful, contented expression.

We don’t deserve dogs. This is the greatest thing I’ve seen in awhile
My dog would’ve fallen asleep with his ass on top of my face.
"I'm not allowed to be here but i absolutely must be here".

Reminds me of the phrase *It's better to ask forgiveness than permission*.
Nice.
Omg so precious 😫😍
Hahah malamutes are so stubborn.

As soon as the owner said ‘come get out of there’

the mal was like ‘...well, now that you want me to, no.’

So gentle! Mine would have talked back Bahaha
I love this pair so much

I feel so safe after watching this.
I lost my side of the bed last night. Got up to go to the br and my lab mix was laying there with my puppy when I got back. They looked to comfy so I took the wrong side and didn’t wake up mad like I thought I would.
How can the kid sleep with so much light in the room?

Good dog

Dog may have fallen asleep but not before putting an arm over baby. Dog will wake up instantly if baby stirs. Good dog.

The dad definitely put the dogs arm around the kid, but otherwise a great video
Kinda a unit innit

Would that be Milpert?
That was the best thing I have seen all day!
I have that same bed!
I love milly
Oh my gosh how adorable is this!! 🥰🥰
I would like this dog to snuggle me until I fall asleep. I’ve only met two “mother” dogs in my life. One was our childhood dog that went every where with us kids (county wild kids playing in the woods all day) and the other I just met two months ago that assisted my old ass down a hill and would move until I held onto her and had her walk me down a steep hill to burn off old grass. Best dogs mama dogs ever
The last clip!
The last few seconds, man, my heart melted into a damn puddle
I wish I didn't have trauma from a dog bite. I know this is so sweet and doggo is safe but all I imagine is the baby having his face ripped off like I did.
Aww

Milly and Rupert, think their youtube is milpert husky.
I’m smiling so hard it hurts
That's cute and all but if the dog wants to get up it's going to push away from the kid with its front paws and there a little close to that kids face for my liking, he won't mean to hurt him but claws to the face ain't no way to wake up
How do you get a dog that chonky? I want to make my dog like that.

Yes
That's awesome.

I immediately recognized Milly 💜
If my husky didn’t shed several dogs worth of hair every day, I would be more inclined to let her on the bed.
If I had a doggo this chonky i would melt
Can’t even
Can we not use "doggo?" It's so cringe.
This is NOT r/aww material this is straight up r/eyebleach
Why force them to sleep with the lights on?
Millie, Rupert an Lola are the Huskies. The kid is Parker.

I remember seeing a post about someone that let their dog lick their babies face and the baby got some fucked up disease where the baby lost part of its face. It scarred me and I warned my cousin not to let their dog lick their younger baby's face. He looked at me like I was making it up but there's no way to convey through words how fucked up that other kid was just from a dog licking it's face.
cute but those bacteria and viruses from the dog mouth
[removed]
I understand this is cute as hell but is it just me or is this not ok....if I tell you to get out the bed, move, or any other command doggo need to do so.
We don't deserve dogs, man...
Oh my god shut the fuck up fucking 'doggo' jesus

Doggo or mayve Dogga ?

I want a dog so bad.
Aww! Calling u/SchnoodleDoodleDo !
We do not deserve dogs.
Cute. But it’s called a dog.
Very cute but highly unsanitary
All I can think about is all the hair all through those sheets.
That kid is way too old for a bottle...
;; you can’t cover huskies with a blanket. They’re snow dogs. That might be cute and all. But still.
We don't deserve dogs...
FFS.  That dog clearly does not want to be there.  Stop putting your dog in uncomfortable situations with your damn child!  Seriously its beyond obvious that you (or whoever made this) is putting the dog in this position against its will...take as much internet points as you want but at the end of the day you are a terrible parent.
Edit: Is this the same clown that I called out for putting the dog in ots childs bed/cot?  Probably is, honestly go take a look at yourself.
We really don't deserve them...❤️
[deleted]
Then the dog has a nightmare and bites half his head off
He choncky
Is that a malamute?
Ears down and back, looking to the owner, video cuts to doggo being put into different positions, irs nit natural and its not right.
Where he first went wrong was trying to get a Husky to do something they don't want to.
Ok but I’m all seriousness that dog needs to be on a diet it’s really sad.
We don’t deserve dogs
It's pronounced hooman!
We as humans don’t deserve dogs.

yes its cute but saying stuff like "doggo" and "little human" is stupid as fuck

Is it just me or does no else get concerned having that bigass dog next to a baby? Maybe someone can shed light on the matter ive never had a dog like that or a kid for that matter. I know most dogs are good natured but what about the few that switch for a second and arent? I dunno please enlighten me

Edit: dont get the downvotes im asking for clarification wtf reddit crucify me while your at it. im asking a question jeesh
Doggo’s mind be like “We may lose out independence, but having a cozy place to sleep is fine by me”
Every time someone says “doggo” I throw up a little in my mouth from cringe.
Get that filthy creature out of that bed!
