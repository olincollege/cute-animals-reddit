Attempts? 
Man  birthed that bird and became its momma
What a lovely success story!
Happy family.
I thought it was going to hatch into a snack

Edit: snake
[Full video (10 mins of footage)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd2srYijPhc)

The egg was laid by the mother in a pet shop, but the day after, the mother was adopted and nobody noticed the abandoned egg until the man in the video came in.

After many weeks of effort, the egg came to life and resulted in a beautiful white colored budgie!

As a beautiful last note, **the man later adopted the baby's father** \-- and now [both the baby and its' father live happily together!](https://i.imgur.com/LzukQE0.png)

&#x200B;

# Edit: All your beautiful comments warmed my heart so much I decided to [name one of my upcoming babies Reddit](https://i.imgur.com/jGHv1R5.jpg) ü•∞

Edit 2: I'll also take this opportunity to urge everyone not to rush to the nearest pet store to adopt a budgie impulsively because of this video! If you are interested in adopting a budgie, I suggest heading to r/budgies and asking questions there! On youtube, [AlenAxP](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlenAxP) also gives great tips for beginners! Budgies require \*A TON\* of love, affection, and attention -- even more than a dog! They are vulnerable to depression as much as a human because they are extremely intelligent and sensible creatures. Also take note that they can live more than 10 years if you take care of them, so keep that in mind! Always be gentle and always talk to them and tell them you love them, they understand human vocalization and will forever have you in their little hearts! Have a good day!
I had a budgie that I raised from the egg just like this person did. His name was Snoopy. He unfortunately passed on October 3rd and that was the day I experienced the most excruciating pain. I told myself I would never replace him. After seeing this video, I wondered, I couldn‚Äôt replace him, but if I could, I‚Äôd do it all over again with him.
The moment where the bird hurries to climb up his chest is just adorable.
Imagine if that was a velociraptor instead! What a surprise that would have been!
His YouTube account: a chick called Albert. 
I love this guy. Such a wholesome and selfless person he is !!
This story is very sweet from this perspective but I'm disgusted with the pet shop that sold a bird from a bonded pair that had clearly been in breeding condition for a while. It's not hard to tell with parakeets.
What a wonderful person. So happy his little family of this bird and it‚Äôs father are together.
this is one dedicated man!
I dont want to own a pet bird because I know they are *so* much more emotionally attached to us. 

Dont get me wrong, a dog will be sad if you leave. But most wont tear their fur out or become so depressed they stop eating. 

Birds can be devastated. 

Also the live SO long. It can be a lifetime commitment and most people (including me) arent will to make it so the animal ends up having a sad lonely life.
This man who runs the [A Chick Called Albert](https://www.youtube.com/c/AChickCalledAlbert) channel on YouTube is one of the most wholesome and genuinely pure people I've sever seen. I'd definitely recommend checking him out
Oh man this brought back some some happy and sad memories. I have hand raised a budgie as well, Felipe, and he‚Äôs been the one and only bird of the 4-5 wife n I have had that actually loved me instead of her. He‚Äôd fall asleep in my hands, would be running side to side in his cage waiting for me to give him his free time when I got home. He‚Äôd also occasionally land on my plate when I‚Äôd be eating to see if there was anything that he liked on there. He was also a great talker/mimic he had more words than our African Grey did. He passed away 6 years ago, I remember holding him and giving him some little scratches as he took his final breaths.
There is nothing sweeter than a bonded bird that thinks your its mother. I had the honor of raising a small baby cardinal from a hatchling and we were closer than any dog or cat ever could be. Like my dog loves me, but theres some ulterior motives for food and attention. This bird just wanted to show how much he loved me. He'd bring me pulled carpeting as gifts, he'd cuddle up in my beard. He was always a little skittish around other people but he'd let me roll him around. Also he never pooped on me which is a big plus. Maybe not the best pets but I felt lucky to have him
I don't know why but at first (and before looking at the sub it was posted to) I thought this was gonna turn into a r/maybemaybemaybe and the egg was gonna turn out to be chocolate or broken or something
His channel is A Chick Called Albert. This guy's a treasure.
omg i thought that was a microwave at first i was like NOOOOOOOOO
For anyone who doesn‚Äôt know ‚ÄúA Chick Called Albert‚Äù check out his YouTube channel.  

https://youtube.com/c/AChickCalledAlbert

He saves lots of different animals. My favorite thing about him compared to other animal rehabilitators is that in my tier videos there are often sad parts where the animal gets sick and the person says something like, ‚ÄúSometimes you have to accept that there is nothing you can do and let nature take its course.‚Äù But whenever a moment like this happens in a chick called albert‚Äôs videos, this m8 is like ‚Äúnot today‚Äù then saves the animal‚Äôs life.
That moment where you can see the heartbeat through the shell and know the little guy still has a chance ü•∫
I just had my second miscarriage and I loved my little eggs as much as this guy. Made me cry. üò≠
AMMA DO A FUKEN CRY
Aww that budgie was beautiful!
That is a truly kind and heartwarming thing to do ‚ù§Ô∏è
Aww!! Love his commitment!
That‚Äôs a beautiful chicken
im tearing up... i havent smiled in a week and that fixed it- thanks for making my day.
I wasn't ready for this today.
I think I know this guy, i love his videos whenever i'm sad i watch this channel.


His channel name is [A chick Called Albert(This is the channel link, I just put the name for you to search if you think I put the link for something else)](https://youtube.com/c/AChickCalledAlbert)
That‚Äôs not just an attempt, he succeeded
Wow, life is so beautiful üòçüòç
The  bird has two dads now
What a beautiful story.  This guys has a wonderful caring heart.
And into my saves this goes. (I only save nice happy things for when I'm having a rough day.)
Love is love

Thank you
Is that real or synthetic bird milk?

Faith in humanity restored for today!
Awwwww...... This makes me miss my budgie. 

Story time: there was a nasty storm were I lived, I was at the shops at the time, had to wait it out a bit. Only lasted maybe about half an hour or so.

Drove back home and found this poor exhausted blue feathered budgie on my welcome mat, still raining a little I picked it up and brought it in. It was a female, age unknown but was matured already, she didn't have a ring on her leg or anything. Bought a cage and some food, I had her for 10 years before she passed away, she got sick from something, we aren't too sure what but I got her cremated, she meant alot to us, she was the first pet my wife an I ever had together.
Beautiful üò¢
Budgie!!
I love these videos that like "man found egg" like this is not a rando on the street that just has a whole incubation operation chillin in his living room.
best thing i‚Äôve seen in a while
Good lord he's beautiful
Bro i teared up watching this
Okay, it's probably the Friday wine speaking, but this is the most precious cutest thing I've ever seen.
aww made me get misty eyed
So this is where Zach Galifinakis has been.
Awwww that's it's momma
I thought he put the egg in a microwave
You say ‚Äúattempts‚Äù like he tried and Failed
man succeeds is more like it
I kinda need a follow up. Are they still living together? Is he seeing other birds? Is the bird seeing other birds? Can it fly? Will it ever? I‚Äôm completely fine with this story line being my new addiction.
That bird probably loves him so much
that first sight of him feeding that lil buddy with a spoon I fell apart. it just looks so obvious that "bro, this isn't going to work, this thing is gonna drown, I can't.......oh. Oh. Hmm. Wow! Look at it ....".(sobbing)
Guess they cut the scene with him throwing up in its mouth.
Awww, bless. What a cute family.
Very aww and all that, but all I could think is waiting for the big moment when it turns out to be a pigeon. Not some cool colorful cousin of a pigeon, a pigeon laid in a gutter in the Bronx that only eats cigarette butts and drinks antifreeze. Have fun with your new pigeon bro
I love birbs. Used to have a cockatiel who never had his cage door closed and he would sing for us, fly to us for head scritches, and even speak words. He would get so hype when we got home like a dog.

RIP Boop 

Birds are way smarter than people give them credit for, make awesome pets when you give them love and attention.
This man is the best!
This is probably one of the coolest and best videos I've seem. People like him make the world a bit happier <3
the way the bird just crawled right into his hands when it was healthy enough to
The channel is "a chick called Albert" aka "acca" and he is r/aww in a nutshell he's a saint and a half.

You're welcome!
This reminds me of the Futurama episode ‚ÄúFry am the Egg man‚Äù. Mr. Peppy :)
I see his videos a lot. I have a lot of respect for him and I'll never get tired of it.
By far the most heartwarming, uplifting, precious video I‚Äôve seen!  A million thumbs up to this man!
its an organic kinder surprise
The biggest banger

from RIOP4L ü§ß
Man at first I thought he was opening a microwave
What an awesome little birdy! I know they're already tiny (and it's really pretty too, I thought it was wild going in so didn't expect that, but now I see it was a pet already), but man just how tiny it was is still pretty shocking. And just seeing a full grown man handle the egg and the baby bird regularly without smooshing it was impressive!

I also thought it would be a failure based on the title. I don't think it was intentionally misleading, and I was glad I was wrong, but you might want to reconsider your post naming technique in the future lol. Usually if you say someone "tries" to do something once the end has already been reached and you know the result, you no longer use this tense/term for it. Either they successfully did it, as in they brought that egg to life- period, or they "tried" [and failed].

Still even being a pet though it was cool to see. And I guess even though it didn't feel as... Special? I guess? It was better in the end because you probably wouldn't legally be allowed to keep a native wild bird as a pet but being hand raised like that wouldn't really leave other options, so it would be sad to give it away or know it wouldn't have survived well if released in the wild. Not saying it's no good if it's from a pet shop, I just think it's more expected than a wild one, and since unlike puppies or something, birds can easily be either, the term "abandoned" makes me lean towards wild a little.

Again, just maybe suggest working on the titles, but very nice. I loved it! So cute and sweet and such a happy ending. Yay!
Damn decent of him
I was expecting a velociraptor
What a beautiful budgie. I‚Äôm so glad it survived.
Check his YouTube channel. It‚Äôs called A Chick Called Albert. It‚Äôs amazing
Source: a chick called albert youtube channel, this guy has a golden soul. His videos make me cry tear of joy and heartbreak.
What an eggcellent story ‚ù§Ô∏è
That's not an attempt. That's a success!
Source: A Chick Called Albert on YT. I love his channel and his work with birds.
This might be the most wholesome thing I've ever seen. Make this man a world leader now please.
When I say the title I thought he tried but failed, thank god
Man pirated a whole ass bird.
Budgies are the best. I've had budgies most of my life, and can say without all conviction that they are the best little buddies you can have.

They snuggle, they sing, they preen your hair for you (without biting in a harsh way), and just sit and chill with you when you're doing stuff...

Man, I love budgies.
I am not crying, you are crying
Damn dude, I thought he was putting the egg in a microwave for a split second.
Every time I see one of these videos I'm like "aww that's so cute" but then there's this extremely unsavory side of me where I just think "I could just squeeze. It would be easy."
This was pretty damn amazing.
I needed this at the end of a shitty day.  Thank you.
This is the most giga chad thing I‚Äôve ever seen
This melted my heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
I didn't read what sub this was in and half expected it to be chocolate... though this was much more heart warming!
Aw man! I wish I have one of that hatching machine alot off unknown egg falling off the tree. I would love a tame bird
Attempts? Id say he was pretty successful
too small xD
This needs to go on /r/humansbeingbros
I can‚Äôt keep a cactus alive. This man has magic in his fingers.
You know, often I find myself saddened by humanity. The meanness, the distain for others, lack of empathy. But it's videos like this that remind me, most are actually good, and we need to unplug from our phones every once in a while to escape the harms of social media. Kinda ironic that it was a social media video that shows me human kindness, but overall in the big picture, my point still stands.
I was hoping for a dragon.
I‚Äôm not crying you are
I did something like this with an egg my parakeet laid. Without the fancy incubator. Being 6 my mother didn‚Äôt explain to me it would never hatch because Bimbo was a single lady. She finally told me if it was going to hatch it would have already.
OP this is so sweet, thanks for sharing
If only we could treat our planet like that egg‚Ä¶
Good thing he has his handy dandy egg matchbox filled with cotton ready to go when he found this egg! Had a bird on the box and everything
Fuck I had a budgie/parakeet with the same beautiful color, white with a blue tummy. From egg to his last day, the most fantastic little guy, 12 beautiful years, I‚Äôm choked up man
Made my day as I am new to reddit :))
"attempts" makes it sound like he was unsuccessful. looks like he successfully  gave life to a lost egg
Are you my mother?
This isn‚Äôt an attempt this is a success OP
I found a Robin‚Äôs egg when I was a child and wanted it to hatch so I sat on it thinking it would work. üò≠üò≠üò≠
Muito bom
You breed raptors?
I was hoping it would end up being a pterodactyl
God damn, I thought by the ‚Äúattempts‚Äù in the title, it was not gonna make it
Attempts? This motherfucker was about as successful as you could hope for
I know his channel! This man is amazing
This is from the You Tube channel "A Chick Called Albert." I'm no good at mobile Reddit but the channel is [here](https://youtube.com/c/AChickCalledAlbert).

So many wholesome stories!
That's awesome. We had a robin set up house in a bush just outside of our porch this past year. One day we spotted eggs in the nest that eventually hatched into four baby robins. We watched them go from tiny pink lumps that couldn't hold their heads up, to fluffy pink mounds, and eventually almost fully feathered birds ready to fly. Unfortunately one night something get into the nest, and only one half eaten carcass was left on the ground below. It appeared as if the mother was out foraging when it happened. We saw here land on an adjacent roof with a mouth full of worms, then fly down to the nest, then fly away. She never returned. After doing some research I was amazed to find out that only about 30% of robins actually become fully grown. It's a rough would out there.
I fear for anyone who tries to get between this wonderful man and his baby!
So I was having a shitty day at work today and I noticed a dove out on the balcony that was shivering out in the rain and just not looking too good. As the day got worse for me and the weather more depressing, I would occasionally walk past the balcony, and sure enough, there was the bird, all alone. As I left work I went to check one more time to see if the dove was still there. There it was, lying there, dead. I was sad the whole car ride home thinking about this little dove dying alone in the rain. I guess this video sort of made it come full circle.
Love these stories.
This man is an angel
Now u gotta teach him some tricks, like stealing money
Man, I was really worried when the title said *attempts*. 

In the first half I'm thinking this is gonna be some joke where it's not an egg

Then it starts hatching and I'm thinking the joke is it's gonna hatch into something weird

Then it's this cute little baby bird and I'm worried cause now I'm invested and thinking it's going to go horribly wrong

But then it just ends and everything's fine, and now I'm wondering if I can stop stressing about this bird and dig into the comments to find it's a happy ending *Phew*
Ok that is just full blown awesome <3
Thanks I needed this .üíô
Never knew i needed an emergency egg incubator.
I hope the mom is okay ! What if she became depressed when they took her away from her little egg :,(
I realise that this is an abandoned egg from a bird cage of some kind, but could you imagine the twist if it had been a reptile egg.

It‚Äôs always interesting watching the incubation process when hatching bird eggs. I love budgies so this was especially exciting to watch.
This really helps me not completely give up on human kind so thank you

Omg, i am bawling like a baby rn!!!!! IlovethisSOMUCH
I once tried to do something similar when I was like 10 years old. At my grandma's house, we found a baby bird (not even traces of feathers yet) on the ground. I gave it sugar water from a spoon and then set it on a flower pot to go get something from my house, which was right next to my grandma's. I did and, when I came back, I found the baby bird was being eaten alive by ants and it wasn't moving anymore. I was so profoundly horrified I just didn't do nor say anything about it.
It still haunts me to this day.
Does anyone know the name of the song playing? It‚Äôs beautiful!
So GlD He was successful. Love üíò this story.
"Lost" proceeds to randomly have an egg incubator and advanced bird knowledge. Sure.
From the channel ‚Äúa chick named Albert‚Äù
The use of the word "attempts" in this title made me worry that it was not going to end well.
I'm not crying....  Your crying.
"Attempts". Why "attempts"?
This was so disconcerting. I thought I'd clicked on the post that was below thing about an edible corn kernel fungus. And then I see this hatch and I panicked.
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
This remembers me of the time I found a weird rock on the ground, and decided to keep it on my drawer only to find out it was the egg of a lizard.

I took care of it for a couple of days and then released it on a little forest near the building I live
Man uses incubator.
Was expecting a dragon.
It is amusing watching the downvotes of the people who point out that people have more compassion/recognition of life for an egg than a human fetus.
At first glance I thought it was a microwave at 0.07 and this was a joke
Lost how?
Burd
I think my first pet is going to be a birb when I move out
He didnt "attempt" he DID the dang thing. What a great man.
Attempt? He came he saw he conquered!

What a sweet man! And sweet birb
From ***smol*** to ***smol***

I THOUGHT THAT WAS A MICROWAVE
I was waiting for him to crush it trying to give it CPR
Note: as in the egg 
Because I thought there wouldn‚Äôt be a bird

Did you just rip off a whole ass YouTube video?? lmao
I love how people sympathize more with an egg than an unborn baby
‚ÄúLost egg‚Äù
How was the egg lost? You can clearly see him taking out of a bird cage in the beginning. This title is shit

Omg I yelled "Awwww" repeatedly the whole video..lol I love this one...gave me the feels pretty hard lol :P
Thought he was putting it in a microwave
BRB, crying
I'll bet that took a lot more effort then the gif let's on, like feeding it every couple of hours or am I wrong?
My exploding heart.
The bond between the bird and the man is heart warming

u/savebot

If you're curious the channel is "A chick named Albert"
I wouldn‚Äôt be able to move from how cute that would be.
Tell me why my dumbass thought he was hatching a chicken

He missed a very important step with a syringe and some ["Fluids"](https://youtu.be/ySuk-eWBG9Y)

I didn‚Äôt expect this to make me as happy as it did.
I'm crying. Fuck. I need to see the whole video but it's messing up for me. Dammit.
Oh I remember watching this video on his YouTube channel. If I remember correctly I think he‚Äôs from France, and does a lot of bird related stuff. I think he also helped some swan eggs that were made (don‚Äôt remember the right word) in winter. Really an amazing person.

Dino dna
Wow!!! That‚Äôs unique! Here I was just hoping for a goose and duck egg! üòÇüòÜ
Achickcalledalbert on youtube. He always makes incredible videos and helps so many animals
I once found a robin egg in the grass. I was going to try and hatch it and when I went to pick it up, it smooshed in my fingers. I felt so bad about that for like years...I still do actually. I picked it up like I would pick up an egg from the fridge, like gently, but not delicate and this egg was delicate.
Good man.
Heck yeah acca(A chick called albert) content, always wholesome.  That dude does so much for his birds.
man succeeds! thought I was in for a sob story
Hmm. A baby dinosaur became a bird.
There‚Äôs something about tough looking guys hand raising baby animals that just improves my day greatly.
How do you prevent birds flying free inside your house from shitting everywhere?
Here take this award!
That‚Äôs amazing
Is this love?
The word "attempt" really scared me. I thought the bird was going to die. Happy Ending!
Amazing!!!
"you are adopted"
It was a dove?  Cmon. If i did this shit would been a pigeon and it would bit me and shit on my car somehow
i got so anxious every time he held it, such a tiny fragile little thing, especially when he... kissed? it? put it by his mouth?
Alright, who wants chicken wings?

What do you mean "attempts"
So the guy just happens to have an incubator in his place or is this a guy who does this often?
Thank for saving him.
Attempts!?

This dude knocks it out of the park.
Lost? He took it from a cage!
People like you give me hope for humanity! God bless you sir
The 'attempts' in the totle makes it seem like it died, im glad it didnt
I did not expect that to become a beautiful white parakeet!  (Budgie for our UK friends.)
These things used to be dinosaurs
Man succeeds
Thank God! I thought for sure he was going to release it and a cat would grab it!
Can I just say I love this subreddit?
Awww
Attempts‚Ä¶ and succeeds.
Aw it‚Äôs a little parrot! So cute. What a thoughtful man to do this.
Subhanallah
Microwave works faster
I crave apple father
I raised my parakeet from its hatch! It‚Äôs such a rewarding experience
No one going to talk about him having to clean up bird shit all over his house

What a lucky little angel budgie!

When he opened the incubator I thought it was a microwave
He has a YouTube channel called ‚ÄúA chick called Albert‚Äù where he rescues birds and animals. Definitely worth the watch.
It's ACCA

I knew it was Albert.
This made my day üòä
abortion should always be an option...

I tried to do that with a duck egg I found when I was 7. I made a nest out of blankets and then sat on it crushing it instantly.
Amazing
Damn, imagine if he‚Äôd aborted it
Dammit Reddit that‚Äôs twice you got me today!

It‚Äôs giving pokemon
You are the mother of birds now.

Someone make a movie about this,
Life always finds a way.
Poorly chosen verb
Thank you for being kind.
This is from the YouTube channel "A chick called Albert!" 
He started off hatching Quail eggs that he bought from the supermarket and went onwards and upwards.
He has such love and patience for the animals that would just be looked over and gives them a chance to have a happy life ‚ù§
Let me guess‚Ä¶

Albert?

Edit: yup, it‚Äôs him, he‚Äôs an awesome guy and y‚Äôall should check his YouTube out, it‚Äôs called ‚Äúa chick called Albert‚Äù I think
Dude must‚Äôve been a Texan. Stupid pro lifers
Who says men can‚Äôt be mothers?
Jvhxhi
Very lucky that a guy came over who happens to have a personal incubator in his home
I couldn't stop thinking that this was going to take a Chappelle "MTV Cribs" sketch turn, even though this is r/aww.

The guys youtube channel is called : [A chick called Albert](https://youtube.com/c/AChickCalledAlbert) if curious. Lots of birds, water fowl, and some baby squirrel rescues!
This is so beautiful
He was certainly well prepared to find that egg.  Right down to the cute little cotton lined matchbook and another person to record it.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs cute, but cmon people,  really?
A chick called albert is probably the most wholeso youtube channel out there

Life.

This my mom. He the best mom in all the world

IT'S ALIIIIIVE
Plot twist: they‚Äôre all different birds.
The bro is a momma!  Good for him, such q cute relationship.
Oh I love this dude‚Äôs YT channel!!
That's kinda unsafe, driving like that without paying attention to the road... but I guess most of us will do the same carrying something that fragile, not an excuse, but something understandable.
That is wild.
Not sure if this info has been posted, but for anyone wondering or wanting to watch more of this amazing person, you can find him on YouTube. His channel is called A Chick named Albert. He does things like this with many different kinds of birds.
That‚Äôs beautiful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Attempts, fool had a whole dame incubation and feed set up for it. Mam knew what he was doing. Friend for life achieved.
Am I the only one who thought he was about to put it in a microwave oven?
OMG this is fucking beautiful, I'm crying.

I'm subscribed to this channel. He does this to many birds, very careful and very caring man. his handle is 'A Chick Called Albert'.
Now teach it to fly!
There is hope yet.

I used to have parakeets growing up and they were the sweetest, most lovable friends in my life.
SO SMOLü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
I love this guy.
One of the sweetest things ive ever seen in my almost 22 rotations
Loneliness is a motherfucker.

Great job üëèI live in PR and This kinda happened to me a bird egg ü•ö fell out of it‚Äôs nest and I tried and tried until I saved it then I had fed him with a spoon and stuff and made his m a little house but then I heard him starting to flap his little wing‚Äôs and fly along the floor then when he started get airborne I took him outside and let him flyü•∫ü§óand he went right back to where the nest was isn‚Äôt that something
HE MICROWAVED IT?!?!?

xqcl
You never know what‚Äôll make a grown ass man cry.
That‚Äôs beautiful..humans are awesome sometimes
So, he swiped this egg from a pet shop?  lol.
I used to have parakeets.  This makes me want another one.
But already born.  I don't know nothin' bout birthin' no babies.
Lost??? He got it out of a bird cage.
How cute! Xx
smol
Damm
Hey, I‚Äôm at least wheat bread during the summer months!
Birds aren't real
Could've had a mini scrambled eggs.
Do birds like this still learn to fly even though they aren't raised by a bird?
Well that‚Äôs one way to befriend a bungie lol
Was waiting for it to get run over
I‚Äôm not crying, your crying!
It's kinda scary how big the egg is compared to the grown bird... laying that can't be easy
Dude is obviously a pro.
Maravilloso !!!!
Man incubates egg, raises resultant bird*
For a second i thought that was a microwave he was opening..
The world is a better place for this
Isn't he the same guy who hatched a quail from a storebought egg?
the egg is like what da h#ll is going on in this car
This reminds me of my attempt at adopting a baby bird. Found the poor thing in the garden on a spring morning, half-dead and frightened. I left it alone. During the day it started to come closer and came to me. I gave it some water, after that some food. It really liked my shoe as a bed so I let it stay there. When night fell it came inside the house with me. Probably for the best, there‚Äôs a lot of cats in my neighbourhood. I made a nice little nest for it and left it alone for like 5 minutes. When I came back it had smashed it‚Äôs own head in on a doorpost and was bleeding out. That was quite tough to see for younger me
CD
ayo its lucci
I feel like John hammon
I thought he was about to incubate it on the engine of his car.
Who else would pick up the egg from the cage and just immediately drop it by accident?
Attempts?
I thought he was gonna cook him in microwave
If this was a chicken, this would've been in r/holdup
