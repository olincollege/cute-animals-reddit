I had 2 of these and they were the absolute fucking worst to feed.

&#x200B;

I loathed every single moment of cutting up cow heart and then spending 30 minutes dropping it and hoping the lil fuckers manage to take a bite. Of course after a few attempts the cow heart is basically mush so you need to go back, cut up more...and re try the whole thing over and over again.

EDIT - Thanks for all the tips ! I was a little kid when I got these with my pocket money. They were actually sold by the name " Mexican walking Fish". They have awesome smiles pretty much 100% of the time :) The cow heart was good because they would always eat it when offered, unlike the prawns (which were our only real options)
The kind of repost that I will upvote every single time. I love Axolotls, and this one is just too cute.
He was going for the next one. His reactions are so fast that he reacts before it happens.

We need an anime that’s just  a derpy axolotl being clumsy and it’s just like slice of life but with chibi anthro animals with that axolotl being the main character or at least a main character!
That one friend that is cool but always lags.

Finally an axolotl made it on the front page of Reddit! My username is Keurig The Axolotl on most sites so this is exciting for me.
I was fine until he bit. That was just too much lol
So sweet :) I used to have one as a pet -they're cute little things!
I don’t axolotl questions, but what is this thing?
That’s probably why they’re endangered.

***The Axolotl and the Ammocete***
by Walter Garstang

Amblystoma's a giant newt who rears in swampy waters, 

As other newts are wont to do, a lot of fishy daughters:
 
These Axolotls, having gills, pursue a life aquatic,

But, when they should transform to newts, are naughty and erratic.

They change upon compulsion, if the water grows too foul,

for then they have to use their lungs, and go ashore to prowl:

But when a lake's attractive, nicely aired, and full of food,

they cling to youth perpetual and rear a tadpole brood. 

And newts Perennibranchiate have gone from bad to worse:

They think life aquatic life is blessed, terrestrial a curse.

They do not even contemplate a change to suit the weather,

but live as tadpoles, breed as tadpoles, tadpoles all together!

World's worst Pokémon.

I love that they are just amphibians who refuse to grow up

Edit. They aren't frogs!
Is that gravel in the bottom of the tank kinda small for an axolotl? I've heard they will eat small gravel and can get impacted.
No wonder Axolotl-Man was never asked to join the Avengers.

I had an axolotl! He only ate worms if I dropped them directly onto his head. If they dropped in front of him he wanted nothing to do with them, he'd just let them crawl away. He also got into moods where he only wanted bloodworms. He was a very cool guy.

EDIT: nevermind, they actually sound like a pain in the ass to maintain. Then again I'm lazy

My (dumbass) buddy in college bought one of these little guys. He was freaking sweet. But after about a week my buddy decided he didn't give a fuck about the guy and just forgot about him. So another friend took over and cared for him, even renamed him. Well, a few months in, the friend had to head out of town for a few days and asked the original owner to feed him while he was out. Of course, the dirtbag didn't, and he died.

I worked next to a lab that worked with axolotls. They are just the cutest little things! They always look polite and awkward even when people are doing experiments on them.
That reminds me of a stoned classmate who always answered the second last question the teacher asked. His answers were mostly right although sure as hell had he not heared the answer given on that question before. Was always quite funny.

They are pretty easy to care for. 1 per ten gallons. No current so canister filters with a current displacer. Nothing in the tank head size or smaller or they will eat it. Cooler water between 65-68 degrees use a chiller in warm climates. The love bloodworms and earthworms. Frozen brine shrimp works great for babies but you have to thaw using warm water to rinse impurities, a reusable coffee filter works great. I do water changes every two weeks due to not using a filter. Use a water conditioner such as glow fish. Its 5ml per ten gallons. As babies till six inches long they are canbabilistic so best for no more than one until that length. They regenerate limbs partial head gills etc. They are endangered in the wild but you can have them most anywhere. Check your local game and fish first. We have two neons that glow under uv light and they are the best. One of ours has huge personality will pose for pics and shows off
