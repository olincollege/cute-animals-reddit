Love the Mousa Lisa
The Klimt killed me! This is the most worthwhile thing anyone’s ever done.
Moustov Klimt!
The Klimt is magnificent.
More pics please ♥️
This is fantastic! I’m glad someone gets to visit a museum.
I would love greeting card versions of the Great Gerbils of Art. I would totally buy  a set.

Where can I buy a set? I want a set. :D
He's going to shred those. I don't think he can read the sign.
SIR! PLEASE STAND BACK!!
Micely 
 done
I’m going to totally do this for my cats and they will 100% not give a shit.
I love that the art work has the requisite museum label.  I'm looking forward to watching the video.
The Klimt fucking killed me. I love it.
"Please dont chew" lol I love it
Pretty soon your gerbil is going to need a top hat 🎩 and a monocle 🧐 for all the sophistication your introducing into its life.
Omg, those are actually really good! Whose the artist?
Make sure John Oliver sees this.
words truly can’t describe how much I love this. My god. Thank you
Please do a Degas with gerbils in tutus 🙏🏻
vincent van rodent
ARE THERE MORE PICTURES?! I NEED TO SEE THEM ALL
If you are looking for sculptures, maybe an Auguste Rodin-t would be suitable?
This is utterly adorable and I am in love <3
Love for Dinner for Schmucks?
Absolutely mousenificent! : ) 

Your version of Klimt’s Kiss is “Golden”!  <3
Your post just made this animal loving art teacher really happy, I love it!
\*Immediately begins chewing\*
Lemmiwinks would be proud.
An art nouveau painting and a renaissance painting in the same exhibit?! Madness!!!
That's adorable
I can hear the music from Ferris Bueller's Day off.
Hilarious!! The mousealisa!!
Love the gerbil style the Kiss by Gerb-Klimt
Good art bro
Those are excellent! Your gerbil looks so happy 🥰
Omg the Klimt!!! 😆😆👍👍👍
*My boyfriend and I spent...
Yep, this is awesome
Belly laughed...thanks for this!
Really awesome!
I love that y’all did that!!
That artwork is legit!!!!
Time well spent!! So cute 😂
Somewhere Ben Wyatt is creating a claymation video or another Cones of Dunshire...

Impressive setup you have there! :)
Hahaha I love this so much. Well done.
This is so great
This is so adorable 😍
This is the cutest thing I've ever seen!
That's adorable
Marry him once you get out of quarantine. He is the one.
Reminds me of “dinner for shmucks”
You should do a line of greeting cards
Hahaha! Was the gerbil actually interested in the space and the paintings? I mean did he "appreciate it" for more than a second?
This is so pure.
This is the best thing I’ve seen all day!
He broke the only rule. He was told not to chew and what did be do
My mom is an art teacher, and she made analyzing this an assignment for her students. Well done!
Banksys next piece
I wish someone loved me this much
What’s the gerbils name?
For the first half of the sentence I thought the boyfriend was a mouse. (I thought it was a mouse).
I didn't realize gerbils had long tails. Very cute! I have guinea pigs.
I love this! Seems your gerbil does too.
Absolutely adorable 😍
This is too cute! The “please don’t chew” has been ignored 😭
AWWWWWWWW
I love this! So creative and caring and well done!
Hahahahahahaha
Hey this is seriously the best thing I’ve seen in a while. Like everyone else, I really want that Klimt rendition lol! I’d even take a tiny print of it! So cute and funny, cheers!
This is amazing!! The attention to detail made my day 😂
How many times did security have to enforce the no chewing rule?
“Vincent Van Gogh. Everyone said to him, "You can't be a great painter, you only have one ear." And you know what he said? "I can't hear you."
The Mona Weasel
Lemmiwinks!
Uh did someone reply “You mean ‘My boyfriend and I’ “ ?
Some gerbils aren't looking for anything logical, like carrots.  They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with.  Some gerbils just want to chew despite the sign.
Hahaha.  "Please Don't Chew!"
So you guys should most definitely create larger prints of these and sell them. Because I will throw all of my money at this gerbil series
Omg I love this. I’m not here with anything clever to say, I just want more pics if you did more mini gerbil paintings??? 🐹🖼❤️✨
Can we take a moment to appreciate that art though!  Hope the gallery gets bigger.
Looks like the gerbils really louvred it.
I don't think the "please don't chew" sign helped
Hamster Fucking Rockwell!
I love The kith
Please don’t chew.
Watch out, buddy. That signage may be a trap!
That sign is futile. He must chew an absorb all the artistic glory put in front of him
Wasn't Gerbil Klimt a character in The Usual Suspects?
The Klimt one is brilliant.
That little boy has great taste lol
Did they enjoy the museum?
What's the gerbil going to visit tomorrow?  Natural History Museum?
How many wings are there available of this Mini Lourve ?
I like how the picture makes it seem normal sized.
so did he chew??
"Please dont chew" Camera pans around, gerbil has edge of painting in mouth. "What?"
Gerbil art galleries go right with inventing calculus on the list of "Great things done during pandemics"
I’m glad your gerbil was able to enjoy all those mousterpieces
Must be mice
THIS IS THE CUTEST THING
Did you set up an paintings from Salvador Mousey? Or Pablo PiCatso?
Kind of fun fact / related. You have a Gustaf Klimt on the wall who had a protege named Egon Schiele. Schiele and his pregnant wife died three days apart in October 1918 during the second deadly wave of the ‘Spanish Flu’. Schiele was 28. Oddly enough Klimt also died in 1918 but during the first wave (in February.) Klimt was 55. Imagine the art that could have been created without the flu pandemic?

Anyways just a tie-in to the current pandemic. Wonder who the future will look back on in a 100 years and say the same about with the current situation.
Only 1 picture?!?! I am so sad :(
The GerbiLisa is great, but I would buy the Gerbil Klimt. Also, I hope the little placards have incomprehensible blurbs from the artists.
Is it a Mouseum?
u/DisjointedRig u/LostHollow
Tape a banana to the wall, get rich on what your gerbil pays you
lol this is awesome.   I like the little plaques, lot of attention to detail.
The Klimt is my favorite.
This is amazing and adorable. Please post the rest.
r/DaysOfQuarantine
This is the cutest
Damn im on day 22 wtf y'all been doin?
Studio Gerbil
**PLEASE DON'T CHEW**

*Chews*
Highest resolution colonoscopy I've ever seen.
Did he chew?
How much for the Klimtini?  When does bidding start?
Hahah "Please don't chew"... You guys are adorable.
Everyone else is so creative in quarantine. They’re making gerbil art galleries and I’m over here playing Animal Crossing for 10 hours.
He needs Brian Swords “Surfacing” print if it’s ever found before John Oliver gets it!!
Something tells me he isn’t going to follow the sign...
Ahhhh, my guy says the Squeekstine Chapel should be considered
“Sir, please take a step back from the artwork.”
Wow I didn't know you could play Animal Crossing in VR
So good! What a lucky little gerbil
Ah yes the Gerbalisa
Before I finished reading I thought the joke was u were pretending your gerbil was your bf
And there he is, chewing away
This is a mouseterpiece.
I had 2 gerbils, salt and pepper. The black one was salt and the white one was pepper because I am a lyrical genius. Anyway, both of them died due to heart problems a few days before they turned 3. Anyway, congrats on your art gallery!
This reminds me of Ben Wyatt from Parks and Rec when he is unemployed and makes a clay motion and defends it by saying “would a depressed person make that?”
This is awesome! 

That "Please Don't Chew" sign is the finishing touch.
This gerbil doesn’t seem to appreciate that for us, we’d have to go to Vienna and Paris to see these two paintings.
Wow! I would love to hear mouses opinion about that one!
r/miniworlds
I miss my gerbils so bad and your lil guy looks like the one that liked to sit on my shoulder like a parrot while I went about my day. This just made me so happy for the first time since all this began! 

Ps the gerbilisa is beautiful work of art.
My gilfriend has a gerbil that looks exactly the same as yours.
Moustav Klimt 🎨
I dont know what kind of animal that it, but it looks like it takes the best parts form a hamster and the best parts from a mouse and mashes them together in a cute furry ball
I've got way to much time on my hands. I might try this.
shit, I thought this was life-size and was like... who let a fat ass capybara touch the art?
I've forgotten how cute gerbils are. Little tan dudes.
This is brilliant. I am jealous that you and your boyfriend could do something so fun together. I can hear the giggles.
Gerbil Klimt!!! SO precious!!!
I need more photos!
😊
What’s the gerbil’s name? As a former gerbil owner I am doubled over in tears 😂
You are fucking kidding me!!!!
That's lovely!!!
epic
You are a genius.
This made it to my country's news 2 months later.
A worthwhile endeavor. Kudos to you
It’s been 116 days since this post. Is Rodentopia finished yet?
He probably didn't even appreciate it
didn‘t u teach your hamster not to touch, just to watch :P
Nice of you to let him touch at least
He's moving in with some serious ITT
Hmmm it’s a mouse
And it took him 2.5 minutes to chew it all to bits
Very creative ! You both have mad skills , thanks for the distraction today
This is THE BEST!
How cute, are you considering making an original work from your gerbil's paw prints?
You made me laugh aloud. Definitely time well spent!
This quarantine is bringing SO much wholesomeness and I love it.
Did you do the art? Awesome!!
“Derivative, bullshit, bullshit; *gasp* that I love!”
It's looking like it's enjoying itself!
Cutest thing I've seen all day!!
Love. Absolutely love this.
This is adorable !!!
Cuuuute
I love everything about this and I’m doing this for my cats.
My boyfriend and I\*\*\*
I had no idea my gerbil was capable of appreciating fine art. And here I was giving him toilet roll inserts to shred. What must he think of me....
Put peanut butter so he can lick the surfaces/mounted plates
Amazing!
This is amazing 💕
This is the best thing in the history of the universe.
Is the one on the left meant to mimic Klimt's The Kiss?
Sir we re gonna have to ask you to leave. It is specifically noted not to chew on the artwork.
Less commitment than a dog,but kinda like a dog,in case it doesn't work out.
No offence, but the whole day!? If edibles were involved, I get it.
I didn't know gerbils had long tails. Cute critter though and nice art. It seems to like his handy work.
"I'm really proud of you" -Michael Scott
I love this so much. This is a happy family ❤
This is probably the cutest and most creative thing I’ve seen come out of this pandemic so far. I love this and can’t wait to see the video!
I’m furoughly impressed! Way to whisk-er away to a time of refinement!
Now this is how you fucking quarantine!!! 
Nice, you guys.
Totally ignoring the signs
"Please don't chew"-- and the Klimt "The Squee"---So clever and so HILARIOUS!   And the little docent explanations next to the paintings.  This is a STELLAR way to spend quarantine!
I needed exactly this kind of quality content tonight. Thank you, OP!
This is beautiful
"Please don't chew" lol. As if any force on Earth can prevent gerbils from chewing things. 😁
Klimt fan?
Incredible! “The Lovers”. I worked at the Detroit Institute of Arts for 10 years, so this got me right in the heart.
\*Chewing intensifies\*
no touching pls
Day 14? Amateur.
YES!
I’m making my parents a magic show.
How do I upvote this post 3 times?

1 - for the mouse
2 - for the details in both paintings
3 - for that sign
Isn't that a mouse? Or am I missing something obvious here?
i need more pix of this art gallery!!
Oh he's gonna chew
Gustav Klimt’s heirs are asking for royalties from your gerbil.
Nice
Oh my gosh look at that "kiss" piece , it is actually really good 😂👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
The kiss is a piece of art in its own right
is this your boyfriend?

[https://imgur.com/a/mkR9pnm](https://imgur.com/a/mkR9pnm)
Which bf/gf?
Aw, I used to have a gerbil that looked exactly like yours when I was little. One of my favorite pets.

Love the sign, lol.
I love gerbils!  They are very cute.
This is amazing and made my moms day 😂😂
The Kiss, lmao
You should do a Seurat (more like Seu-*rat*) and recreate the Ferris Bueller scene!
One day..........
May I share your post on my Twitter acct, it's just so funny!  (w credit of course)
This is the most humane thing I've ever seen.
Aw, you need to read Norman the Doorman.  It's a children's book about a mouse who lives at an art museum and is secretly an artist himself.  It is totally charming, and this reminds me so much of it.
He will be so cultured
*my boyfriend and I...
You should do some sculptures by Rodin-t
I love it, looks like hes breaking the rules though
My boyfriend and I*
Which species is it?
Show me the blueprints.  Show me the blueprints.
This post is giving me life
As a fellow gerbil owner, i say to you this:



CUUUUUUUUTTTTEEEE💖💖💖💖💖
Is this the pet that got featured on John Oliver's show
But he will chew. Of course he will chew.
God damn bad timing. Im just hunting a mouse in my bedroom at 3am
Klimt!!
Ahhh the hamster embrace. The most fuzzy of all passion
Please don’t chew 😂😂😂
That isn’t an art gallery until you have the banana.
ahahhaha the quarantine makes ppl even more amazing. awesome.
That is just a hamster with a tail
New animal crossing graphics look amazing
And look, seems like your gerbil enjoys looking at the gallery
The new Animal Crossing has great graphics
Y'all are meant to be together this is too cute
Please reddit I need 14 karma 5o post I need to post an important post. Feels like a duck G achievement on xbox
So cute!
I'd love a video of your gerbil touring the museum!
Oh my gosh your Klimt painting I love it
Thank you for this, it made my day!
Omg this is so cute, do you have more gerbils? I would love to see them all 💜
/u/title2imagebot
You know things start to get bad when Dinner For Schmucks starts to become a documentary
The Kiss...love it!
This is so fucking cute and clever. I love it!
The Kiss!!!
Gerbil Klimt is brilliant
I hope you keep your gallery after this, not just because of all the effort that went into it, but also because it's just so goddamned precious, it needs to be seen by everyone. All of them.
“Please don’t chew” love that sign and the art work! Such a cute gerbil!
Omg, klempt.
We're going to need one of a Mouse screaming, call it the Squeak.
That's adorable
Time well spent
You are wonderful!
Day 30 isn’t looking good for that gerbil. You’ll be renaming him Lemiwinks and playing dangerous games.
CN you please add Banksy artwork?
Looks just like one of my guys
This is incredible on so many levels.
Aaaaaamazing!!
Twist: the gerbil if your bf
This is just perfect
Relationship goals!
“Please don’t chew” haha ❤️
This is so cool!
Gerbil in Gold. Love it.
You’re my favorite people
This is amazing.
omg lol....so wholesome ♥
This is so charming.
I live this so much
This is so effing cute! And he likes it!!
Awesome. Should do a Chagall, Piscasso, Dali and Van Gogh as well!
Relationship goals
You know, your time could be better used opposing your government.
This is just amazing
My boyfriend and I*
I'm concerned the Gerbil Lisa isn't protected behind a thick pane of glass.
Gerbils are real?
He’s breaking proto bud.
I absolutely love this.
Reminds me of Redwall
A gerbil of culture!
What’s the painting on the left originally called?
LoLolol
Couple goals!
Thank you for being you.
I love the “please don’t chew” sign 🤣
This is fantastic!
So cute! I let my cat pick out my pajama pants today.
r/miniworlds
I'm concerned for your sanity.
So funny. But cute
I bet he didn't even say thank you.
Just need to add a "Gerbils Playing Poker" and it'll be perfect!
“You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not”
Wow. Did you draw those yourselves? 

Because they’re actually really good looking and I kinda want one...
B           B 

Wwwww
Who’s the a-rat-Ist of the family? These are great!
So cute!
We need more of this. Like a full gerbil Louvre!
one of my biggest turn ons.
Is that an original KLIMT?!!!
That’s one lucky gerbil!
Sex would also have been good
The work of art is on permanent loan from   Kunsthalle Gebillia
One of the best art galleries
You know he's just going to eat it all.
Now get him to reenact the Thomas Crown affair
Ok that’s adorable.
This is a laugh I sorely needed today.
Fucking rad
Lol wonder how long till he eats it. Nice work though.
I regret I only have one upvote to give.
My boyfriend and I.....
Nice... Hah
Wow, that would take some tiny hands to finish a whole art gallery. How long did it took you to make everything?
Coming this fall... " Mousa Lisa's Whiskers"
Wow ! Now that's what I call  time utilisation,
All you need now is to watch Dinner for Schmucks! I think it’s on Amazon Video. Great work!
Before I read the entire title I thought you were referring to the gerbil as your boyfriend
Was so hoping the qr like codes on the painting labels would actually work.  This is awesome
[Don't eat the pictures!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9PenLqJyHU)
I hope he listens to the sign
Ever seen the movie, Dinner for Schmucks? You might love it, or you might hate it.
I hope there was a portrait of the great Lemmewinks in that collection!
If there are aliens and they see this, they will just lob an asteroid at us and skip remote contact. Or they will make you our overlords. Either way I don't like where this is heading.
Having a flash back of Redwall. Good read if you've never heard of it.
This is so adorable 😭😍
I fucking love this so much the entire day was worth it for this image.
Stop it with these geronimo stilton type comments.
Omg it's beautiful
This is incredible ✨
Lmao, no chewing
My heart. 🖤
Oh this is precious
I can't believe he's disobeying the sign.
That sign is great
Awww. He likes it
American Gothic!  Omg it would be amazing!!!  You guys did an awesome job!  So cool!
Brilliant
What’s the piece de ratsistance?
This reminds me of the movie Dinner for Schmucks where Steve Carell’s character is a taxidermist that constructs scenes like this for various mice.
Omg the kiss!
Pls dont chew
Add: Blue Cheese by Jackson Pollock
I was once in the modern art gallery in New York with my ex and started examining a switch on the wall. People stopped and examined it too!! It amused me no end.
This is productivity in its greatest form
I demand more
This is so cute!!
Just adorable and the Mona Gerbil Lisa is as priceless as the sign fobidding chewing!
Please tell me thats not the Gerbils first time seeing another Gerbil.  

Deer lord that is adorable however.
He seems to appreciate your efforts.
*my boyfriend and I.

Jfc. /s
Typical tourist, immediately chewing the art.
GerbilKlimt is the best thing I've seen all day!
Awe
this is why I reddit. Thank you so much for sharing this :)
Quarantining is making me change my mind about wanting a potential significant other. I wanna have someone to make mouse museums with too now lol
He's chewing he needs to be escorted out
Time well invested
Appreciate the signage.
Teef
If you haven’t seen the movie Dinner For Shmucks, I highly recommend watching it after this creative feat.
You must live close to a dispensary
How dare you. Show us more. We are quarantined.
Love the sign!
Magnificent
lets get some Martin of Redwall sword action going
Theres one rule and hes breaking it😂
Quarantine day 237, we ate the gerbil
IT'S AWESOME!!

"The Kiss" is absolutely amazing!
Klimt is one of my favorite artists!! This is ADORABLE.
The Kiss! I love Gustav!
Don’t lie, you did it for reddit points
I thought this was going to say something about a mouse that paints.. weed man
He's just gonna have a lil chew
This is pure good. Thank you for this beauty!
Could be worse....a lot worse.
This is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen... This must make it on a news segment about what people are doing during their quarantine!
I want a life size of the Klimt
I cut a picture out of an art magazine and put it in a little frame just above my cats’ food and water bowls. Just thought they might like a little decor. I’ve been wanting to get some like doll house sconces to put next to it.
Art by Van Gnaw
Hamter...
You may say I’m a dreamer..
Reminds me of Dinner for Schmucks.
i just spat my cereal milk bc this is so cute
This is amazing 👍🏻😌
Quarantine high? 

Cannabis high?

Or a bit of both? 😂
‘The kiss’ in mouse form is ALL i needed.
This is so creative and adorably executed!
Are those QR codes at the bottom of the placards?!
r/isolationmademedoit
Ima bad boy
As someone who loves art museums and small rodents, this makes my heart smile
Please do a video of this with The Smiths in the background like that scene from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off.
This is why I go on reddit.  Thank you !
Just came in here to say that gerbils are the best and totally underrated! Love your cutie! Now I'm gonna go say hi to mine :)
Those tiny QR codes on the description plaques
I loveeeeee it
Saving this to look at later because it is so adorable!
I love that there’s little labels next to the art!
Sad life ha
Those are so adorable.

Would love to see a mousified version of The Scream though.

I imagine it wouldn't be as cute.

You could call it The Squeak.

Edit: Scrolled down to see other comments. I suppose I am not as clever as I thought.
[deleted]
This is really exceptional art. Brava!
I love seeing all of the interesting things people have been coming up with to do at home 😂
Well this is gorgeous, and I’m so glad it’s original content, too! Those are some wonderful artworks! ❤️
I’m glad you love your gerbil. And that you aren’t having human children.
Damn, it looks like fun to be in quarantine without kids.
Please attach a0 banana to a wall ( for scale of course)
That portrait looks like something that would adorn the walls of Redwall Abbey.
i LOVE this. I really needed to see this today. thank you
That's awesome!  Love the do not chew sign!
I cannot give this enough upvotes!
Fantastic. Your gerbil is a fellow with taste I see.
Oh I miss having gerbils. I can't find anywhere to get them anymore.
Amazing,lovely idea! Very cute and original.
Amazing and adorable
I can’t tell if it’s really big or very small
You should make it a dirigible next.
"Great! The gerbils get to out to see stuff!"


"We have a museum and you've lived here your whole life and never seen it!"
Please don’t chew LOL
🌽
So sweet!
Go to party city and buy various animal costumes. Then go to the science department of an elementary school after they complete the biology chapter with the shoe box displays. Hire a great photographer. Then sell tickets to the zoo
This give me Dinner with Schmucks feels 🐀 💕
You just won the internet.
Amazing.
I'd love a people sized versions of the Gerber Klimt! Let me know if you ever sell any!
This is the best way to spend time!!
Thank you. I had somehow forgotten Gerbils were a thing until this post. It's like a piece of me has been found.
He can’t see or understand it. Just give him a treat
WOW a truly productive day in quarantine
I must see more
I have never seen something so absolutely incredible in my entire life
Absolutely amazing. This makes me so happy it’s almost confusing.
your “Kiss” by Klimt is exquisite; the G. is now for Gerbil instead of Gustav.
A real dinner for shmucks vibe.
I think your gerbil likes the Mousa Lisa
Hahaha cute
So beautiful! I’ve never seen a gerbil that color. What is it called?
Aw they like it
Why are gerbils so big these days?
He or she has excelent taste
You had me at "an art gallery for our Gerbil"..... Amazing!
You and your boyfriend are treasures! Thank you for this.
Perfect
Mousalisa
Love this
Can I be part of this relationship? You guys are awesome hahaha. 10/10.
I have that Klimt at home, so cute!
THIS IS A ROBBERY. PUT THE GERBIL IN THE BAG.🔫💰
Because the sign's there your mind goes in the opposite direction.
I remember what it was like not to have kids
This is fantastic!!!
😂😂😂
lmao love this. You guys should watch dinner for schmucks if you haven't seen it yet.
Umm gonna need a full blown Insta account of this, this is fantastic
HAHAHAHA! I love Mousa Lisa. Cute idea guys. Thanks for sharing. 😁❤👍
Only day 14?
I love your gerbils colours so much!
I am Moushkage kira i am 33 years old i live where the villas are in morioh.i am in bed by 11 pm and i wake up like a baby that slept a full 10 hours
This brings Life! Thank you🥰
This gives me life.
“Please don’t chew” :)
Your interpretation of The Lovers is breath taking!
The is so cute lmao
Looking forward to the video!
That’s adorable!
That's probably the cutest thing I ever seen
I bet hes going to pull them down off the wall and then chew/piss on them
"The Gerbil in Blue"
Hmm what about the virtuvian mouse by Leonardo da Mousey
Omg. This is beyond cute.
Dont eat the pictures.
Well at least you with the person you love, I can't see my girlfriend and my depression and anxiety is getting to me.
Your gerbil is a madlad.  He is so ignoring the don't chew sign.
Hey! Read the sign! Geez, gerbils these days have no respect for modern art!
make me wanna get a gerbil so I can do this too!
Do they have a little mirror too for the gerbil to look at it and realizing the drawings are about them. Maybe add gerbil statues in the little art museum
A day well spent
This is adorable - not just the picture, but the idea of you and your boyfriend doing this little project together through your quarantine boredom :) looking forward to more!
I like Gustav Klimt
The furby version of [this](https://furby-revolutionary.tumblr.com/post/175340264226/in-a-room-full-of-art-id-still-stare-at-you)
As we see here... He/she truly does he a fine in art... Beautiful indeed
I don’t mean to impose, but being a man of art myself—what’s the entry fee?
You’re with the right guy :)
Beautiful dark-eyed honey you’ve got there. My last gerbil just passed on over the winter. I miss my little guys. 😭
Yet he chews anyway
That’s thoughtful as shit!
Tomorrow... A theme park please!
Did it chew?
Gotta give up some gold for the Gustav Klimpt "The Kiss (of Gerbils?)"

:( I'm out of coins
Omg I love this!
Did your Gerbil seem interested? Does it like Redwall?
Jenna Marbles is that you?
Love the tiny QR codes on the placards
Moustav Klimt
Who else start playing the elfen lied theme song in their head when they saw the painting on the left?
This is brilliant!!
Okay jenna marbles

Love it
cutest thing ever!
I love everything about this.
Looks just like my old gerbil, my first ever pet! Cute little things, enjoy them!
OMFG—you win, time to cancel the internet
Derivative
This is the most wholesome thing I've seen all day..marry that man
Next up is teaching it to read, apparently.
Gerbil and Hamster.

Where the hell did thise names come from.
This is all kinds of awesome.
Noooooo I had one I loved so much when I was a kid ;.;
This is amazing!  Quit your day jobs and please do this forever!
I'm so JEALOUS, my husband is essential, I wish we could have fun like that.
Dinner for Schmucks?
I love that the little guy is enjoying it so much!
This is the best and I need to make sure I see this video you're taking about.
He really shouldn't be allowed so close to the artwork. You need better security.
This is beautiful
It seems like you have a lot of extra time on your hands....
!Remindme 2 days
Solid
Please submit this to the Getty challenge
Does he like the art work?
Love💓
This is art in and of itself
This belongs in a mouseum!
I truly love this and I don’t think that’s a gerbil. Still supremely magnificent.
*and asked her, where is her boyfriend?*
its consistently amazing me how living the way i always have for two weeks has everyone making reddit posts
Aww, this is amazing.
Me too and me and my house... No.
There are some talented rodents in the house
You guys might be my favourite couple of humans at this time.
How’s that “no chewing” rule working out?
Keep an eye out for the plague...
BUT HE IS CHEWING IT what a bad boi
This is fantastic lol what a cultured lil guy
I see „The kiss“ you guys are awesome 👏
Fantastic hammy
this is so unnecessary but so necessary at the same time
Don’t chew dare touching the art
Your boyfriend looks cool
I thought Gerbils couldn't be kept alone?
So, your boyfriend has a girlfriend AND a gerbil?  That’s a rarity.
When I don't feel free and can't do what I want I just react. I go against it.
Me, trying to speak danish...
Now I want to do that for my gerble.
I love the "Kiss".
dont touch the art!!!!
I feel blessed
"Please don't chew"
He/she really seems to enjoy the effort you put in! So wholesome (,: ❤
What a tiny dog.
😳 Wowww 😳 now that's time on your hands.
Aww I can picture a whole village. Cinema, supermarket, casino etc!
This is insanely charming
Please don’t touch the art
I once stuck a gerbil up Richard Geres arse. True story.
Y'all ever watch dinner for schmucks?
That Gerbil will chew.

I read whole gay instind ok whole day...
Adorable
All these pictures of gerbils has now brought to his attention, that he is horribly alone
"Quarantine,day 15> Me and my boyfriend ate our gerbil."
Wow so your boyfriend is a human
r/thathappened
This is awwsome:)
I just love this so much.
Well, I may have a new favorite Reddit post.
I’m laughing, charmed and in love with your appreciative little one.  Those tiny big d’ail almond eyes...and I love the  signs
Your Gustav Klimt is superb!
Art is love
**g e r b i l**
Yes
**This is great!! It's a 🐁 right, so adorable**
Oh to be a Gerbil with its own art gallery
so worth it! I need to see a tour
I need to take a virtual tour.
im gonna do this for my turtle too! so lovelyy
"Please wash your hands."
Are you allowed to eat the artwork in this gallery?
This is amazing.
I want to put that gerbil Klimt on my wall right now
A gerbil of culture I see
Call the docent. This patron is not obeying the sign.
Haha, so cute!
Nice Mousetave Klimt pic.
What do you have against chews?

That gerbil looks chewish.
While being an awesome way to play with your gerbil, I'm worried you didn't put a "s" at gerbil. They must leave by pair or trio, you seem to care for your pet so either you are misinformed or maybe his/her partner died recently?
That is the best thing I've seen all day!
This is just so wholesome and lovely. Nothing like that sick bastard Lemmiwinks.
So cute
That is too cute
Please don’t poo.
You have a very lucky gerbil
gerbil 💓
Did you guys draw those yourselves?  And if so do you post your artwork anywhere?
We gonna need more pics
Creative
They are people of commitment and sheer fucking will!!!
That’s Effin cute
I can picture this.....
I love this so much.
Klimt must be proud in heaven
A little humor in the midst of this pandemic always goes down well. Thank you!
Hes got a crush on Mousa !<3
Umm more mouse art please! The two pieces here are fantastic!
This is the cutest. I can’t 😍
Nice and wholesome
Time well spent
My goodness! I love this so much!
Please do a full instillation
This is the best! Glad I found this.
This is so adorable!!! What is your gerbil's name? Do they have any friends? Makes me miss my old pair
How cool!!!! And cute art. Your gerbil seems to recognize the Mona Lisa gerbil.
So cute.. awesome job
So cute. It reminds me of Leo Leonni painting

That's better than what Richard Gere would have done out of boredom while locked up with a gerbil.
Hey you got featured on SNL tonight! On Weekend Update
So... Did it chew?
That's a very cute gerbil, love those creature <3 I have one too <3 \^.\^
This reminds me of Steve carolle's character in dinner for schmucks..
It was super cool to see this featured on SNL tonight!!!!! Around 12:30 they talked about a couple making art for their rats and showed these pics :)
This is so fitting as I just watched the movie [Dinner for Schmucks](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/474496510711425944/) for the first t me last night. Then I wake up check reddit and find this jewel of a picture here....smh and lol.
The Klimt was a nice touch.
Give me y’all’s best Mona Lisa mouse puns:
Richard Gere has been looking for him.
I'm no Richard Gere, but I do approve of any gerbiling!
You need to make this your new career stat
Where is the picture of Richard Gere?
[deleted]
Richard Gere’s butt has gotten classy.
Skip the Richard Gere exhibit. I hear it’s shitty.
In richard gere’s butt
Richard is that you.....?
Title should read.... “TIL: A gerbil lives inside Richard Geres ass, and has its own art gallery.”
It must be one hell of an exhibit for that little bugger to leave the warmth of your colon.
Make an interactive display for him with a paper towel tube up your ass and lighter.

Richard Gere style.
Wait.. That's a gerbil? I thought it was a mouse.. I thought gerbils were like mole thingies..
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. 

I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 

I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
This is great but my first thought was oh my god get a life , then I remembered no one has a life right now so then I thought a gerbil come on two people a whole day , a day you've thrown into a hole to get what kind of reaction from a cage rat. But it's your day and you didn't hurt anyone so there's that and maybe you had fun I don't understand puzzles or the people that pla no do them.
