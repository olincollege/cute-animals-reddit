Max looks like the ‚Äúgoodest of boys‚Äù...tell your daughter she has a special friend with Max...
I see he is ready with his mask for situations in which social distancing isn‚Äôt possible
[deleted]
Love him!

You guys should post him in /r/goldenretrievers too
Mr Max is a fine, dapper fellow. Pleased to make his acquaintance.
He‚Äôs a blood üò≥
My husband and I do the same thing! Thank you for contributing this sweet face to our nightly ritual.
And now this has added a little positivity in my life. Thanks Max!
He is wonderful, and we have the same bedtime routine :)
We do the same!
Awww i do this with my toddler too! We call it 'puppies and kitties.' Glad to know other parents use the full power of this sub. Many sweet puppy cuddles and sweet dreams for you and your little one.
He's so pretty :)
Thank you. I hope you all have peaceful sleeps.üß°
Hi Maximo! üíô
üôÇ
Max appears to be ready for adventure with that kicky bandana.
Best boi....
I feel the same S2
Good lad that one
Aww, you have lots of positivity messages to read to your daughter. Children remember their childhood pet for life, take plenty of pictures of them both for the fond memories to remember when she is older a very special PAWsenssion to have
Cutest looking blood I‚Äôve ever seen
What a handsome pupper! He looks like the bestest boy!
One of the goodest of Bois!
Maximo Bark
Just what I needed to see before bed, thanks (:
Hey! Listen up! If you think you're going to get away with posting just one photo of Max you are sorely mistaken, buddy. We need more Max.
Little positivity? More like little pawsitivity!
Are there different types of Golden Retrievers? I feel like I‚Äôm more used to seeing ones who look like Max with a rounder head and softer expression. But I also see some on the internet with blockier (?) heads and their brow/snout area is a little more wrinkled.
Great, now I‚Äôm reminded that I never beat Maximo
Awww, love him. Golden Retrievers are such love sponges. Give him lots of kisses.
Yes, hes a good boy
The next crisis of the pandemic - the D'aww Scale of r/aww has broken completely and may not be replaceable because of a nuclear explosion of aww. The culprit goes by the name 'Max' or 'Maximo' and seems to be associated with a mysterious Redditor called 'u/Elgringoloco888'.  Honestly none of the reddit is too deterred because the aww scale breaks on a near to daily basis.
What a sweetie
A very good boi-o with a handsome tie!

I LOVE DOGS IN BANDANNAS! Bandannas are like suit and tie for Dogs. They just look so smart.
My kids and I are new to Reddit, we love aww, eyebleach, oddly satisfying! Any other positive / creative subs we should check out?
F reddit.

He looks like a good boy.
Upvoted for the dog, stayed for the header
Sort of related, but why the fuck does everyone have that exact same bandana?
Maximo is very lucky to have a human like OP's daughter.  I bet he's already posted her to g/yarpp on Grreddit .
Good boy
S‚Äôgood buoy
You don't need any extra positivity when you have that darling boy.
He's a blood it seems, a good blood boi
(It's a joke, don't get triggered)
Hi Max!

Max looks so polite!!
I do the same with my girls. Max looks like a good boi

Tell your daughter "good night" and she needs to give the goodest boy extra scratches since he posed all pretty like
Oh he is the bestest boy.
Me too, I look at r/aww so I can forget about the news for a while ‚ù§Ô∏è I also have a doggo named Max üòä

The bandana is a nice touch
I love how the upvotes are growing faaaaasttt

Nice doggo
What a GOOD BOY. And what a good dad!
My son and I used to do this. Thank you for the good memories
The best of tradition. Maximo is a good boy :)
What a sweet night time routine, and a positive screen time for kids! üíì
What‚Äôs Max short for?

Because he has little legs.

Sorry, I‚Äôll leave now
That‚Äôs a good looking dog. I‚Äôd get all types of down low tongue faced with that dog.
He looks so much like my old boy Trevor
We love Max

Hello baby max
Why are you looking at other pets though? Huh?
Our lab / Australian shepherd mix passed away a few weeks ago, she had the same contemplative look as your dog.  Damn I thought I was done crying about her until I saw this picture.  Give him a good neck scratch for me.  We miss her terribly.
/r/funny
Your good boy is so good that he's what made me join r/aww (new Reddit user, this post was the one showing for r/aww
Max is a good boi
Hi max, you are so cute!
Smiley boye
Beautiful Max! My dad has a Golden named Mack! And I am looking at r/aww because I read some of the news headlines and my stomach started to twist. Quickly switched to Reddit and only for the awws
Is he named after Maximo of heart boxers fame?
that is soo cute
Maximo is a very good boi
Maximo is very very greatimo. Totally a word too. Portmanteau of great and IMO. Your kids are lucky to have a brother like him and as is he to have them as siblings. 

Thank you for making an otherwise wretched Monday greatimo. Couldn‚Äôt help myself. 

I‚Äôll shut up now. 

Night. Night.

Edit: messed up some words. Monday, ya know?
He looks so sweet. He‚Äôs lucky to have you.
Tell your daughter Max is one of the goodest bois I‚Äôve ever seen!

Hi Max! You are so handsome in your red bandana and I love you. üíï
What a good boy!
I like his wittle bandana on his neck
Man! I was wondering how many parents did his. So, my six year daughter is not an r/aww fan, but she loves the hell out of r/instantkarma
Unique name, especially when shortened. Also an extremely unique breed. What is that? One of those Retrievers? This is the rare content I come here to see.
Just what I came for üòç

Hello max
Is your golden also a wiggle butt?
Adorable, omg! ü•∫
My little boy used to love to flip through r/aww with me, especially the videos.  Until he learned of r/minecraft. So now we'll end the day looking at epic builds and watching people accidentally dying in lava......

Glad your daughter recommended Max on here.  I felt the warm and fuzzies immediately.
Daaaw!
Max looks like a very good boy, please give him a hug on my behalf and tell him the bandanna suits him ‚ù§Ô∏è
Cuteness overload
Beautiful dog!!!

I love the bandannas on goldens, they truly are a great breed, fun fact: they can also be trained to sense blood sugar issues and alert you before it becomes a problem, they make great diabetes service dogs
He looks like the sweetest pooch ever‚ù£‚ù£‚ù£  And very dapper with that bandana.  üòÅ
Dat portrait mode tho
Sir Max The Very Goodest Of The Good.

If you decide to have another puppy, name him/her Minimo!!!

He is such a good and beautiful boy. I love your idea to look through the subreddit every evening. It's so sweet and positive.

hello sweet boy! keep protecting your little human and being a good boy.
Hello Max!!
Awwww ü•∞
He looks identical to my brother's golden, Charlotte. Idk how to post pics in the comments (plus it's super late here and I'm too tired tbh LOL). But seriously, they could be twins.

that is a really good and useful purpose for r/aww, if you don‚Äôt mind i‚Äôm going to borrow this activity with my kids.
At over 72 thousand likes and heaps of rewards. Max is very popular pup for pawsitivity.
So sad to see another dog throw his life away for a gang
Max looks like such a beautiful good boy. Give him a big hug and a kiss on the head from me <3

Respect the blood

MAXIMO!!!!!!!!...Come get some treats
Oh my God what a sweet sweet face!!!

Nice
Good boy looks very nice for a gang member

Aw Maximo, you are an utterly adorable good boy
Maximo, mmmmmm
Is his favorite line "Mi chiamo Massimo Decimo Meridio, comandante dell‚Äôesercito del Nord, generale delle legioni Felix, servo leale dell‚Äôunico vero imperatore Marco Aurelio. Padre di un figlio assassinato, marito di una moglie uccisa‚Ä¶ e avr√≤ la mia vendetta‚Ä¶ in questa vita o nell‚Äôaltra"?
Don't show your daughter this site. Ffs. Try to spend some actual time with your family outside of CCPedit
So cute
Max made me smile this morning, his eyes look so caring.
Imagine showing your young daughter reddit ü§£
Blood gang gang
Awww, what a good boy.
I honestly hope you just look and never delve into the comment section. Its full of absolute negativity at times it makes me sick.
Hold up, Maximo as in for the PS2? Good taste.
Maximo, like the PS2 game?
Max, you‚Äôre a handsome boy. Nice to meet you x
His eyes sparkle so cutely!
Total good boy!

Golden Retriever: "You are not touching me. I am sad. I am worried. We must be touching. Pets. Scritches. Laying against you. Must touch or sad. Must touch or sad. Must touch."
Max is beautiful! Wish I had a pup like that. ‚ù§
 Maaaaaaax
Maximo is a perfect fit for this subreddit
That's a good boy right there!
Too cute!
The bandana reminds me of Mushroom from Life os Strange 2
My daughter and I do the same! Hey Max!

My daughter my wife and myself had a dark golden retriever a beautiful golden red named Max! He was a good boy too and is terribly missed üíô

You really should post a video. I was expecting a typical loveable labrador ready to produce a few hundred newton metres of tail wagging tongue licking excitement.
Plz givus foodems or treatums
I have an important message that I need you to deliver to the doggo.

*Dawwww.*
G√úDBOWEEEEE
You didn't even need to come on reddit to look at r/aww. He looks like the goodest boy.
I have an strong pet peeve for dogs with cliche dog names like Max. Should've gone for something more original, like Peeve.
i don't know if sewing is you or your partner's thing, but ya'll could teach the kid how to sew cute hats for doggo. or bow ties.
Yo maximo!
"Here's my dog".     
Huh, that was easy...
Oh my god, his little bandana is so cute
Wow what breed of animal is that?
A beauty and knows it too. Lots of love from our canine family to him.

Beautiful baby

Max is such a adorable little guy.
Sweetest and kindest dog faced boy. He's a boy with fur.
[removed]
My 5yr daughter n me do the same nearly every night. She always asks if we could watch cute lil puppies on my cellphone. Nice to read that there're more people who use the power of the peaceful r/aww for a lil positivity. üòä
My husband and I save them up all day to show each other at bedtime.
Now I feel bad for showing my kids r/childrenfalling before bed...
I do that with my daughter a lot too.  Great bonding time.

Thank you for sharing! Maximo definitely belongs here. He's lovely.
If I see him with than bandanna on I‚Äôm gonna say.......









ITS HIGHHHHHHHHHHHH NOON
Boop that snoot.
Back in 1994 our family adopted a dark Golden that looked exactly like yours. His name? Max!
This is a good pup. You can tell, because *look at him!!*
I too have a Golden Retriever named Max!
I imagine goodboi max being naughty and having associated his full name to a disappointed owner who found out about the chewed shoe.
hi Max
Maximo is a cool name my dood
oh my goodness!! that little face looks exactly like my golden. please tell him i love him!
This is a cute tradition
Max is amazing
I say WOOF
What a good boy, he looks happy.
Thank you, I needed that tonight. Give Max a good ear scratching for me. He looks like a super good boy!
Oh the handsomest goodest boyüíó
Oh, thank you for sharing. Max is just what I needed right now. ‚ù§Ô∏è Beautiful, sweet boy.
Very handsome boy! Glad to meet him
That doggy forehead looks like it's lacking kisses. I volunteer to administer treatment.
Hi Maximo or maxforshort!
Max looks like the goodest boy, give him some belly rubs for me.
He's beautiful! What a sweet face. üòä
Do Goldie's just come with a scarf (or bandana, whatever) already around their neck? 90% of the golden retrievers I've seen in pictures on here have them.
Max looks like he deserves some treatos !!
The BEST BOY! AWWWWW
Such a sweetie!! Very good boy! Now go give him some cuddles from me üíïüíïü§©
He‚Äôs lovely
max is so cute <3
Amazing!! He looks like a sweet boy!!

My son and I do this too! He says, "can we please look at kittens and dogs". How can I say no?!?!
I like Maximo's jaunty kerchief. Very handsome.
Good boy.
I believe it is scientifically proven that dogs wearing bandanas get 10x cooler.
Max is awesome!!!
Who‚Äôs a good boy?! Max is!!
I know of 2 video game folk with that name one from lufia and the other is the main hero from ghouls and ghosts
Now everyone‚Äôs life is gooder. Tell your daughter that we lover and thank her.
Maximo! Good name!
Tell Max and your daughter that me, my son, and our pug say hi!
My wife and I do the same thing! Thanks for sharing!

So sweet. Max fits right in!! My kids and I look at this sub together all of the time. I bookmark a bunch of posts to show them later on if I can‚Äôt show them right away. They really enjoy it ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I aww-ed
Me and my 5 yo daughter do the same thing! She says it helps her not have nightmares.
Holy crap. My DOD has a twin
Soooooo sweet. Love the bandana!
Max is a beautiful boy! My daughter & I do the same thing.
Aww to the tenth degree! Give him a head scratch for me.
My daughter and I do the same thing while her little brother Max reads with my husband. She‚Äôll love this!
Awww. What a good and sweet boy. ü•∞
Awwwww! Sleep tight Daughter
This story gives me hope for the world.  Also, cute doggo. :)
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!
Cute :3
My five-year-old and I do the same thing. He loves dogs. Every picture he goes ‚Äúawww, him so cute!‚Äù Well, except for the Chihuahuas. For those he says ‚Äúugh, him has ugly eyes!‚Äù
I just wanna hang out and share a bag of Jack Links (not a sponsor of this comment) with good boy Max.
The best boy!!
His bandana is very dapper!
Good doggo 10/10 would give petz.
That is such a precious tradition to formü•∞ü•∞
And such a cute puppy!
Same even I do this before sleep, watching this sub is a must for me. I also do it during lunch breaks, I love animals but have severe allergies with fur. I love watching them from distance.

This sub is the best.
what a sweetie üê∂üê∂üê∂
Max is very handsome!
Max looks like the bestest of puppers. Had a golden when I was young, he was 60 pounds of love and never figured out why he couldn't be a lap dog like his siblings. He would lay across the chair with feet dangling off each side snoring away. They are wonderful beings!
Had to make it 20k 200
<3
Boop
Such a handsome boy!!!
he seems like a good boy, nice!
Give him lots of snuggles for me!
And my wife and I are doing the exact same thing...thank you for sharing üôèüèº. We hope to have a sweet pup, very soon üòä.
I love him, he's beautiful.

Maximo the Magnificent 

We need more of Max. Please. Its not a ‚Äúwant.‚Äù Its a ‚Äúneed.‚Äù
Total cutie, she was right üòçüèÜüêæ
My little guy and I also scroll through r/aww to help transition to bedtime. He always really does say "awwww!" to his favorites. And good boi Max got one too.
Thank you for shaking such a good boy, he seems like the kind of dog that would hug you back.
Awwww!
Awww i wanna pet him.
Aww
What a good boy. Even had a mask unlike other dogs who don‚Äôt care.
Omg that sweet face! 
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Good boy Max!
My little one and I look at r/aww pretty regularly when we need some positivity. Whatever motivates y'all to post your cute animals, thanks! It brings a lot of happiness to our little house.
Max is one of the most handsome boys I‚Äôve ever seen!!!
looks straight out of the movie Up!
***TUMMY RUBS!!!***
Such kind eyes.
What a handsome boy!!!
Maximo DapperMaxMax for long
His eyes are screaming I LOVE YOU in this pic....lol you an ur daughter have a goodnight sir.
Hi, Max, and his people!
Is Max a good boy ?
His little bandana ‚ù§
He's beautiful. He reminds me of my dog, Shadow, from when I was little. I love golden retrievers.
Max awesome. Protector of family. Insert treats for upgrades.
Tell your daughter she a very good boy :)
I want to boop his snoot!
Or Maximum Adorableness for long.
My heart! I love Max! <3
I wanna give him a peck right between the brows what a dapper goodfella.
Such a cute boy! I use to have a German Shepard named max. Sweetest boy I ever meet.
Good color match with the bandana, clearly mastered the sitting position, pout face executed to perfection. 13/10 would bestow head pats
Shut uuup!   
Our family was surprised adopted by another Max, short for (after a bit of research) Maximus, which of course didn't make any sense, as he was the the only one abandoned by the litter, and had to be hand-fed, and yadda, yadda, yadda ...
The best boy!!!
Max looks like a stellar best friend. Thanks for sharing his pic and the cute nightly ritual!
Looking sharp in that neckerchief.
11/10, would love to give head pats.
Thank you! What a cutie :)
He's in the movie Tombstone isn't he?
Now this is a quality post! Hi fren!
He is a very good boy. What a sweet face.
Such a FACE!!!  Just wanna squeeze that sweetie & give a boop-kiss to that nose!

And after all this containment, the 2 dogs here are working my nerves, so thank you for this gorgeous puppy.
He seems, I dont know, concerned.  Have you had your cholesterol checked?
Good night Max
You didn't name your dog after IBM Asset Management Software (that's found in most most major colleges and manufacturers across the US) did you?

EDIT: Your dog is beautiful BTW.  What a handsome boi.
Super cute! Goodnight Max! ‚ù§Ô∏è He‚Äôs such a good boy!
He is absolute perfection
Aww so cute!
Nice bandana!

Great idea, little friend! I got to look at this before I went to bed, and it was so cute I had to show my husband. What a great way to end the day! Thanks so much for sharing your sweet pup with everyone and be sure to give him a big hug for us ‚ù§Ô∏è
