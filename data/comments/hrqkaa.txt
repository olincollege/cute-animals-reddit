"HAMMER, DOWN!!" As Reinhardt spitefully pushes the mug off the counter-top.
He is the blessing
REINHARDT REINHARDT REINHARDT
He has got a quest for you.
Mercy is pocketing him
You're powered up! Get in there!
Looking like a warrior cat with that pose
Reinhardt stood proud amongst the trees in the forest, a furry chin chiseled firm as he looked to the sky. 

"For what have you brought me here to do? I have given peace to the animals of the forest, I provided safe passage to the salmon and only ate 2, what do you still desire of me?"

A crack of thunder sent a shudder through the earth, and the skies became bright as a booming voice and hands as big as bears came down from the heavens.  

"You have served your fellow animals well, Reinhardt." - The voice proclaimed

" I have no more missions for you. Just head scratches."
Your cat just realized that Magic is Everything
r/supermodelcats ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Busts out shield and starts charging at you
What a pretty boy. I got a Sibirian Forest cat too, a ginger one, tho. He is such a pretty dork. I love him
What kind of pokemon is this
Your photos of Reinhardt are always amazing.
Ana?! How can this be? I thought you were dead!
Are you ever afraid that he will run away and not come back? I always have that feeling with my dog but she gets excited when I call her name and always runs back.
*overwatch player located*
HONOR, JUSTICE,
His shield is that fluffy tail
King of the forest???
This looks like it could be a poster for warriors , that's that cat ninja book right
ARE YOU AFRAID TO FIGHT ME?
He knows his mission now.
Where is his hammer?!
Why is the cat on the forest moon of Endor
I REMEMBER THE POSTER. MY HAIR WAS AMAZING

Reinhardt is a beautiful name for a beautiful cat. Makes me think he is a wizened cat warlock with hundreds of years of wisdom under his paws and is ready to take you on a quest into the ages
That's such a good photo
Majestic
Notice most of the light is on his tail which cats believe is the grandest thing of all.
Great pic!
Whole smoked salmon falls from the sky.
awww I remember seeing a picture of Reinhardt before and commenting about my cat, Bastion lol. What a majestic baby
I love the overwatch themed name!

In other words he has recieved himself
This is an amazing photo
Reinhardt, at your service!
My kitty is named Winston, they would get along great!

He's recieving a Catchphrase
This NEEDS to be framed! Put in a museum. Possibly painted- Renaissance style
Re;zero anyone?
This might be the best picture of a cat I‚Äôve personally ever seen.
Holy shit this guy is the king of all cats. My kit-cat would bow in his name.
I just went to your profile and upvoted all of your cat posts lol

Really wonderful portrait. What body/glass are you using?
Speaking for the trees, I can safely say we all love Reinhardt üå≤‚ù§üå≤
New phone background
Reinhardt: Adventurer! I have a Quest that needs some Urgent Attention!
Please get a smaller cat and call her brigitte, please
This cat is going to give you a side quest
that name is hilarious and that cat is awesomely beautiful.
This is the type of image that I expect to see on r/pics

Why? It is a great image. Time was taken into it. It is not just some haphazard taken phone pic with a backstory title. 

Please take note r/pics future posters.
I dont have any awards to give so hopefully this will do. One for you üéñ and one for your beautiful baby ü•á
Correction the cat IS the blessings from heaven
He's receiving that Zenyatta transcendence.

Is he a Norwegian Forest Cat?
When i see this post: ooh! Poof cat! He's posing too!
Wow. Meow wow.
Khajiit has a quest, if you're interested.
I‚Äôd be so afraid something would see my cat as prey and just eviscerate it right in front of me.
No. That's the sun which is a giant burning star.
Is he praying for life or for stamina?
Beam me up, Scottie...
So majestic.
*inhale*
Is there a feather falling from the sky for his satchel?
A blessing from the Lord!
HONOR, JUSTICE, REINHARDT REINHARDT REINHARDT!
He looks like he is about to start some heroic quest
Or he is getting a message from the spaceship where the cats came
The chosen floof
what a beautiful and adorable cat :)
Wahrhammer Fan ?
In through the tail
That cat is living it‚Äôs best life.
[happy angel noises]
the most majestic boi!
This reminds me so much of My Baby (my boyfriends cat) who is literally my favorite thing on this planet. 

Seeing this picture made me smile. Your cat looks so sweet and happy! Definitely many blessings to the kit kit! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Very Pok√©mon cardy.
It‚Äôs probably best that we return to our spiritual foundations and begin worshipping cats again.

Then construct some bloody large, marvellous pyramids or something in their honour. 

Those were good times, circa Ancient Egypt.

Sure, the enslavement of others was ugly and most unfortunate. But worshipping cats and building pyramids made for better years than, say, 2020.
Reinhardt's just leveled up!
Or a message from the mothership
He is the One True King
I think you've peaked as a photographer with this one. But please keep taking photos like these

Edit: omg I just browsed your recent posts, and I'm in love with your cats
Good Kitty. Yes, that is what they used to call me. Good Kitty the gray. I am Good Kitty the White.
floofy cat
Of course the mercy‚Äôs on him
I'm prepared to follow Reinhardt on a quest through the forest.
Pretty sure he‚Äôs about to meet Gandalf the White.

Is the name of your cat based on the Overwatch champ?
Amazing photography!
Good luck on your quest, OP!
You‚Äôre just gorgeous Reinhard!

How is he such a good boi?!? I would love for my cats to learn to be good bois too.

Reinhardt is the coolest cat name I‚Äôve ever heard!
You named your cat your last name?
Maybe that‚Äôs my grandmas cat Merlin. A black kitty. He was always a sweetheart. They look like they would be good friends!
If I know my gaming, and I do, then he has a legendary sidequest that needs completing - immediately.
He has a side quest for you
This is the most majestic thing I have ever seen.
