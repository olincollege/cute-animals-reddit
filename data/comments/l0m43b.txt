What the fuck kind of daycare is this?
Raccoons are adorable. Terrible pets, as they will destroy your home. But cute none the less.
I love raccoons, but if they had the leaping ability of cats, I'd be terrified.
I feel so bad for the trash panda
Wallaby (Edit:  I'm sorry if I spelled this wrong I'm not paying attention), lemur, cat, AND a raccon? Can they hire me? Edit: oKay, so apparently it's NOT a lemur. The tail does look a bit off. Edit 2: okAY i understand now, it's a Coati. Thanks. Edit 3: Okay- I understand it's a coati-

Because you're a fat little trash panda my man, sorry to break it to you.

Because Cat's treat gravity like all other laws and rules - something they only adhere to if they feel like it at that exact moment.

Source: my 18lb chubby boy cat that can *still* make the top of the door in a bound when he feels like it, this is a cat that regulary rolls off chairs in his sleep.

His sister is even more frigging agile, I'm still trying to figure out how she made the gap over the cupboards in the kitchen, that's 7ft off the ground into a vertical gap about 25cm.
"Oh that's just Ricky the office Kangaroo, don't mind him."
The moment when Raccoon notices Kitty  escaping is priceless.  You can tell it opened up a whole new world of possibilities to him.
Free him!!!
Did you know raccoons like to wash things?
It's cute and all but it feels kind of wrong to have lemurs and other wild animals caged up in a cafe.
What kind of magical place is this?  Cat, raccoon and kangaroo! Didn't even know they were allowed in the same countries.
Idk where/what this is but it doesn't seem right. Wallabys can be very kicky

Even if it‚Äôs cute af. This should not be a thing. These are wild animals. They are not pets.
Not comfortable with the idea of a Raccoon sharing space with cats like that. Even captive-born ones often carry Bayliscaris, a horrifying parasite that can seriously mess up other species.

Never compare yourself to others. You have your own strengths. Learn to harness your strengths and stop wasting time trying to copy others.

How is it that cats jump so damn well? My cat will eye up a spot in my house and I'll think in my head "yeah right" or "she better not knock anything down" then she just springs off the ground like it's a spring board and gracefully and gently lands wherever she was jumping to.
Omg poor little thing!!
That‚Äôs so fucking sad lol
Me, who used to hang out at a parkour gym: Is this a parkour video?  
Racoon: No.  
Cat: Yes.
Where is this place?

No one bout to talk about the kangaroo just chillin there?
Um, is that a kangaroo?

Raccoon: Why can't I jump like that? Can ya'll give me a hand?

Oh ooh ohh I feel so bad for him/her. That brought a tear to my eye. 

I have two small senior dogs one is quite springing, the other is not. He has his own small couch because he can't jump up on the regular couch. This raccoon looks like my dog trying to get up on the foot stool. I feel his pain
hes trying so hard
Poor trash panda.
I thought it was going to be the kangaroo.
I'm 99% sure I have been to this location. The racoon gets mad when he can't come out for snacks and will keep jumping until he gets let out.
holy shit i live in toronto and i just realized how lucky we are that raccoons cant jump like cats

poor buddy nature gave u tiny hands but nothing to reach
That kangaroo ain't got nothing to prove. It knows it outclasses everyone there, but is humble enough to not show off and lets the cat have its small victory. Mad respect.
What kind of cat is the one jumping
He is trying his best ok!?
u/2rfv the raccoon reminds me of me doing box jumps XD
Raccoon looking like every short girl trying to reach something on the shelf.
The fact that the racoon is trying to get out the way he saw anther animal do it really speaks to their level of intelligence.

Cats have powers, they think I want to be there and they are...nothing to do with jumping, they discovered phase shifting eons a go.
Isn‚Äôt this the meerkat cafe in Hongdae?? That‚Äôs the only place I can think of that has that weird cat thing, wallabies, and raccoons. If I remember correctly, there‚Äôs also a Fox?
Cats are fucking magical
Cat's don't Jump, they simply switch gravity on and off.
These animals should not be cohabitating in a cement playroom. This is some gimmick to charm people but it isn't good for the animals. Not much better than a roadside attraction.
That‚Äôs actually sad as fuck
This subreddit is seriously confused about what's cute and what's cruelty.

This isn‚Äôt aww at all. It‚Äôs sad and not what should be allowed on this sub. These animal cafes do not have the animals best interests in mind.

Is there a version with sound? 

If not, I would like people to assume that the raccoon was screaming with a building volume while attempting to jump.
# FREE HIM
Don't worry lil' raccoon, you're a lot smarter than him and if you really need to get up there your raccoon buddies will form some sort of raccoon pyramid for you to climb.
Where do I go and who do I need to pay to gain access to this room?
This is gross I‚Äôm sorry, but this is wrong. A cafe with wild animals just for entertainment?? What is going on with this?? This is not r/aww in my book. It‚Äôs just sad.
They let you have them sit on your shoulder and eat. It's adorable. Need to go back there sometime soon.

I know the feeling raccoon bro. I know the feeling...
This is my condensed basketball diaries of 1st grade.

I was on a team with a kid who later varsity lettered when 14 and went on to play pro ball...
Raccoons are so smart. He saw what the cat did and is trying to replicate. Just not smart enough to know he's not a cat.
I've never seen a black kangaroo before
Rocket! You have thumbs, craft up a bomb and blow the lock.
It like a cat is kind similar to a spider as for jumping up a surface?

Not every hero can jump over the wall or drop expensive fragile things off the table with no effort and that's ok. Not everybody has superpowers. Some just have to rely on their resolve and ingenuity.
The kangaroo was a red herring.
Ahhh you jumping cats!  but I have beautiful eyes;)
Racoons is confuse
Don‚Äôt worry little raccoon, you will make it to the top one day!
Let it go tiger, its not your day.
Hop. Hop hop hop.

You vs. the guy she told you not to worry about.
Why are those animals locked up? They are animals from the wild. Not pets. Why are they locked up like that ?

Who else read the caption and thought the kangaroo was gonna jump
It‚Äôs not legal to have raccoons in my state so I would be excited to hang out at this daycare and see what they‚Äôre like as an owned pet.
That is me.
Yo I‚Äôve been there. There‚Äôs also like feral wolves/foxes of some kind in there too
I want a pet raccoon so bad. People always think I'm crazy but they're cute as hell!
Very cool hah
Coooool
Where is this glorious place ?
Lol. True
I have no words to describe how much I would like to work at this facility.
