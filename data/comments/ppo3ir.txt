She’s trying to inquire where his daughter is currently located, while also calling him a bastard
Isn't the audio from [this](https://youtu.be/PvsRQtcABfw) ?    

  Or is that audio fake too?
My inner voice: I am in danger!
That is the most confused expression I've ever seen on an animal.
"No I didn't take anything. Why do you ask?"
Dog: Uh-oh. I knew she was gonna be mad. She- she’s really mad. Fuck. She’s coming this way!
Thanks…….those eyes just made my day.
I bet someone broke the spaghetti in the middle
My wife: that looks like someone is trapped in a dog. 

Totally agree.
Omg that could be a meme! That dogs reactions are great!
What language is that? It's fucking terrifying.
Poor Pup. So scared ! Definitely need to take him home and give many snuggles and snacks.
That’s the best thing I’ve seen in a very long time. That pupper is absolutely precious. Thank you for that!
That's me about five minutes after taking a second dose because "this acid is weak"...

Brocko: Yeah…definitely…in like…a second though…
That look when you are at a friend’s house and they go to ask their parents you if you can sleep over and they get into a huge argument about you while you’re standing right next to them.
I'm assuming this is in Italy. So following this logic, Italians have really expressive hand gestures, so maybe Italian dogs have really expressive faces since they don't have hands.
Hes thinking:,, damn Giuseppe realy fucked up this Time".
When you like gangsta rap so you decide to check out the hood.
Classic cattle dog behavior
The other day I went out to get the mail and my neighbors across the street were arguing in the garage with the door open. This was my exact face
Anyone know what the Italian lady is saying?

This doggo need to be a meme STAT! Thanks for sharing such a cutie!
[It appears the audio is fake, taken from this video.](https://youtu.be/PvsRQtcABfw) If you turn the volume up you can hear it was recorded when it was windy, which fits with the cat on the balcony.

Or, maybe the woman's shouting was so loud it was captured in two videos taken at the same time, but the animals were in two different time zones - one during daylight and the other at night.  In which case, we may never know how many animals were traumatised by this one event.
*u hearing this shit dave*
Dogs thinking if he should lock the doors.
His expression gives away what he’s thinking: BITCHES BE CRAZY!
That poor dog, I think he understands what they're saying!
Livin in da street is ruff
Do I have to fight to save my human now???
Case closed....Dogs actually process information rather well.
Any way to downlod this video?
Translation? Sounds like my mom when she found my cocaine. That dog ironically looks like me when she found my cocaine in my dad's music collection.
That’s amazing lol 

We have people behind us that are always fighting in the backyard, the kitten watches out the window like it’s a Housewives episode lol
That's one hilarious facial expression.
Which breed it this?
Poor baby
Poor baby he looked scared.
Lmaooo dogs are so fucking great man
This was me (27f) when I was driving in Chicago by myself for the first time and the GPS took me to the bad side in the southern part. Traffic was backed up from an accident. Some rough lookin dude walked up to my car and started banging on my windows, asking if I wanna buy some socks (he was carrying a Walmart baggie of white socks). Being a 19 year old freshman in college where my town doesn’t have a ‘bad side’, I was terrified
Well, this is about to be a massive meme
This is hysterical!!!
This needs to be a gif.
Sounds like an old fashioned Latin language exorcism.
Someone give that dog 500 ml of hug NOW!
This is great. I love this.

Quite literally speaking in tongues, good lord, I felt like I was listening to an exorcism.
That dog is stressed AF
I like that dog
I love DDS.
LMAOO look at that face, so funny!!!
Ahhhhh hahahaha my god, what a cutie
That dog wants no smoke hahaha
Cutie pie
His face lmao

I love dogs
Poor doggo
that quick look directly at the cam in the beginning really gets me here. soo cute and hilarious at the same time.
"hooman i am concerned"
The dog is like “you hearing this shit?”
When that edible kick in and you got advanced hearing.
Mommee?? are we save here, mommah?
The expressions this dog is giving off are priceless. He’s like cool but very concerned. Also confused? No, no…he is anxious.

This is the funniest video ever. I have to save this, so I can view it daily.
Dog thinking.....I hope she don't open the door and tell me to attack..... I'm a lover not a fighter and I don't want nooooo smoke!!!
I vote we all take a collection for this dog.

...and at that moment, dog realized the exorcism had begun.
A new meme has been born
Can anyone translate?
Looks like Crash Bandicoot’s expression
This dog is all too used to fighting. You can tell by the amount of anxiety it has.
I really needed a good laugh today. Thank you.

Anybody notice the eyes moving to the exact timing of her screaming?
When you're at your friend's house and their parents get in a fight with them.
thats a spooked looking puppo
Lmao god I just love dogs for their insanely expressive faces. What a cutie patootie!!
Italian lady swearing and yelling remind me some old German speeches on the masses
Now I have to learn Italian so I can sound good while I fuss people out. Even while yelling that is a sexy language.
Second time I see this, still cracks me up.
I always find that cursing in one’s vernacular always hits different. 

That “BASTARDO” came from the depths of her soul.
Omg turn the light off so she don’t see you
OMG I love this animal.. 😍😳

That dog is my spirit animal, I also look like I'm on the brink of panic and collapse
Lmaooooooo I’m fuckin deceased. This dog is like “oh hell no” “what in the hell” “everyone just enjoy a boney treat and calm down a l- oh no she didn’t”
This dog’s reaction has me in a giggling fit
gli italiani che guardano questo post
I'm Italian. Trust me, don't try to translate this
I love how that woman is so fucking angry but since she’s speaking Italian it still sounds beautiful
This was me my first night in Miami 😀

Let’s just say she’s very angry, got me spooked

Wind in the audio. No wind in the car. Its not just tik tok with the fake audio, this is the future of many funny video clips
One of the best dog reactions i have seen.
God I laughed so fucking hard at this.
Why wasn’t this video longer
Anybody care to translate for us?
Ruh Roh!!!
Please, someone translate what she's saying. We are all curious

Poor dog
Oh that’s like me this afternoon. Dude was passing under a tree next to my walking route and he was like “get away from me” I look up and I’m still walking by him and he says it again louder. I’m like…. Just staring at him as I walk by as he had turned around from pissing. Proceeded to be in my neighborhood for the next half hour. Fucking freaked me out. Thought I was in a different neighborhood.
he can talk!!!

I don't know which video came first but there is one with a cat looking out on a balcony with the same screaming lady. I swear this is fake.
He looks stressed out. Lol.
She need some milk
*chuckles* I'm in danger!
Is this the real audio?
If those screams triggers that type of reaction on an animal imagine on a child or a human …..
That's not a fight,  it's just an Italian speaking on the phone.
Totally!!!!
It's like this! Omg could be the same dog even

The moment you walk into a room and everyone is arguing and then all of a sudden turn to you and ask your opinion. And you're just standing there like "gimme a full 3hr recap of what just happened very slowly cause i may or may not immediately regret this"
(Yeah, you can let me out anywhere but here.) (Double fare!)
I’m too high for this. Expressive dogs are awesome.
Awww, this poor dog. He’s genuinely concerned.
That is the closest thing I’ve seen to the look on my face when my mom went off after noticing my precocious 8 year old self had carved my initials into the glass on her great grandmothers antique mirror… with her diamond ring.
This pup is the epitome of “oh no”
At the very end, scared dog saw her coming closer. Got more scared.
Oh shiiiiiit!

I love how the dog looks at its owner for guidance then realizes it's hooman wont protect him from this kind of crazy
Me and this dog have the same idea, hit the gas man.

That dog would be me
The part at the end is what gets me lol. The pup switches/moves over a bit to see what she’s doing. It’s as though he saw her hit the guy and was line “oh damnnn”.
Dog can tell that the screaming people are crazy.
That pups expression is so uncharacteristic. Love it
This is undoubtedly the funniest thing I've seen in a long while. Thanks for the lols.
Hilarious!
That’s a good protective dog. If you can see the white around a dog’s eyes it means it’s ready to attack.-bite!
That’s definitely a cognizant werewolf
Yo it’s my cake day!
That puppy is completely freaked out.
Poor pupper!
Poor dog deserves better.
He looks like Scooby Doo right before he jumps up into Shaggy's arms.
It doesn't even blink 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
This looks exactly like expressions from Paddington the Bear from the new(ish) live action movies (which are absolutely amazing, btw).
I took my daughter to a new park today. Beautiful neighborhood, stunning houses, well maintained lawns. Expensive cars in drive ways. Suddenly this shitty little beater car pulls up and parks at the curb. Car sounds like it’s barely hanging on and has mismatch hood and side panels on.

I immediately thought they were definitely there for some sort of drug deal.

Then someone in the car started yelling and cussing. Packed my kid up and noped out of there.
What the dog doin
Fight? Isn't that just conversational Italian?
HAHAHHAA he/she is confused
Shitttttt....Me Hope Hooman dunt spect me to fite
I love this dog
Most comments disregard that this pup is understanding more than we give animals credit for understanding.  Animals understand aggression and raised angry voices just like children would.  They are not as "dumb" as people think; they can pick up on vibes quite well.  And this doggo is picking up that the vibe in this place is not a vibe.
This is exactly how I feel when I hear raised voices in public.
Can I please get a woofle?
What’s the woman screaming?  Sounds Italian
lmaoooo
Poor puppy

I mean, in the dogs defense, that was terrifying
Nice doggy

As an American, I train my dogs in English and it's only ever occurred to me to train a dog with English commands... I don't know why but it is super fucking funny to me that there are dogs that understand Chinese words. And just the thought that there are dogs that know more Russian than me...

This is like the Chappelle skit of being left in the limo in front of the projects at 3am
That doesn't sound like a fight though, just a calm italian discussion.

Loosing it!    big time ranting and frothing at the mouth.....letting everyone know you blew the main fuse....Doggo knows angry humans and glad he's in a car.
When you drive into the vets parking lot to freak out your dog
Haha adorable
Wait what was the dog actually reacting to
Recently drove 'cross country, sleeping in my car, mostly at truck stops. Out of 10 places I stayed, 6 of them had an intense fight/argumenet *right next to my car* (two of the places were BLM and national parks -- two truck stops I got lucky at, or I was in too deep of a sleep to be woken up from). I don't know what the fuck I was doing wrong. Sometimes I parked close, sometimes I parked far, but I always got woken up.

The worst one was around Colorado. I heard a man talking to a woman, whispering, followed shortly by the woman absolutely bawling and sobbing. She kept saying "you promised, oh my god, you promised!" I peeked out my curtains from my cot in the back and saw her huddled up against the wheel of her car, sobbing her fucking heart out, with the guy nowhere to be seen. She sat there weeping for, no exaggeration, at least 90 minutes, never letting up except to take a deep breath so she could cry even longer. Kept repeating "you promised, you promised!" I wish I had heard the beginning of the conversation, because I'm dying to know what promise had been broken. By the time I woke up in the morning the car and the woman were gone. I hope she ended up OK.
Hahaha 😝
This is adorable! I'll come back here everytime someone upvote my comment

Dogs can sense when someone is happy or mad at it. I would say the dog is contemplating it's options right about now
That dog’s face says it all
Ah, that the "I don't want to be here anymore." face. Quite understandable poor pups.
THANK YOU ! I saw this on insta and died laughing but could never find it again to show other people. That dog is killing me 🤣🤣

Record this audio, overdub it to acoustic guitar; start your ethnic emo song about a girl.
When your dog starts looking like that, it is time to leave..... quickly!
The dog is really aware something isn’t right, very inquisitive
OMG, I just have to see this dog everyday. He’s like human. 

Seriously, that is one beautiful dog. I wonder if we could see more of this pooch.

He is a meme king waiting to happen!!! Please let me know if there are memes with this dog.
He's seen things...
E la miseria
She sounds like my mom
cazzo, nervosella
The dog heard his name?
I would’ve just stepped out of the car and grab a lawn chair and then proceed to grab myself a large soda, a large popcorn and a pair of 3D glasses and then just enjoy the show
Literally me and my siblings our parents where in a different room then us since we our older we get room together (we are all girls), it happen it the early summer of 2021 so I couple we're fighting in front of our door they were loud. keep in mind this in ocean springs for a vacation but overall it was a good time.

The dog literally looked like me and my friend when we got gas at night after grabbing some food and there was two people arguing loudly. We decided not to park nearby a fair distance away and watch while eating but the idea did cross our minds lmao.
Looks like me trying to figure out what language she’s yelling in and hoping it’s nothing about me.😂
Scooby. Is that you?
Good dog lovely
What breed of dog is this? Looks super cute!
If dogs had cell phones I swear I think he'd be taking video
Well the lady is clearly possessed.
🤣🤣
I love the way the dog's eyes go back and forth.
omg, i need a gif of this for group chats lol
Poor guy
