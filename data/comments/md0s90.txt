Palamute*

12 hours until monster hunter rise! üòÅ
Shedding has to be a nightmare
I want to hug him, but I think I'm going to disappear into his fur as soon as I wrap my arms around him.
I thought for sure this was forced perspective until the dude moved the bottle and I realized 'That ain't a 20oz, it's a 2litre and it is bang on next to the dogs leg.

I had never realized a Malamute could get this big.  And that tongue, he could probably lick someone's face clean off with that damned thing.
how much does it cost to feed him?
That‚Äôs a Bear.
That looks like a Tibetan mastiff with malamute coloring. A truly massive animal!
I don't need a dog lead, I need a saddle
For a few seconds I though this must be a perspective trick.
It's a Mala-mutant
How do they get that big???? Isit just random? Like 1 in 100 pups week griw into the stay puffed marshmallow dog?
You know he's the lap dog
As awesomely huge this guy is. These ‚Äúgiants‚Äù are riddled with health issues due to the popularity of their size. So for anyone wanting a malamute, know that a well bred malamute is still a huge dog (ours was 103lbs) and to please do your research before buying from any breeder.
MOUSE?!? is that you?!?
Arcanine??
r/absoluteunit
I just want to give him so many boops
Hug. Dat. Floof.
‚ÄòTis but a puppy
Did you know:  Alaskan Malamutes drink up to 8 liters of Sprite per day
What a unit.
You spelled mammoth wrong
This dog looks like it can shit more than my maximum carrying capacity.
Gorgeous, if I get taken down by 100 pounds of fluff the so be it! üòçüòÇ
I thought Clifford was red.

That's a goddamn ginger polar bear
Sir there‚Äôs a freakin mythological dog on your table
HOLY CHONKER
The poop bags onna walk be like......
It is he, the biggest of boys.
I bet it still wants to sit on the owners lap
That beast has more self control than my 8 pound cat. She'd have the whole counter to herself and the soda would still end up on the ground.
omg I wanna cuddle it so badly
That‚Äôs not a dog that a fricking bear
Amazing dog, but I couldn't imagine having that in my house. The hair, the slobber. Dog probably eats his weight in food every 2 weeks. Gorgeous, but holy shit that's a lot of work.
Damn. Bet there‚Äôs some Tibetan mastiff in that pup
I've met a couple of these in person. It's not hard to see once met them why they're used for pulling humans for transport. 
A team of 1-6 of these pulling you and you're REALLY hecking going places (!).

Edit, yes. This is a cross, clearly. A decent sized malamute is what I was basing my comment on though.
~~nobody:~~

What should be every soul on this planet: PETTHEDOGPETTHEDOGPETTHEDOG-!
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the biggest dog I ever seen‚Äù - Brian Fellows
I'd have to see this in person in order to believe it. I'd have to see it and pet it and squeeze it and kiss it and love it...*then* I'd believe it.
Nah that‚Äôs a polar bear.
This is a deep fake isn't it. That pupper's just a pomeranian in a Marvel leotard and a Ruffalo-inspired tennis ball hat!
man: I'm now gonna trim your nails

malamute: *growl*

man: sounds good, let's keep brushing your fur
I bet that's a actually a bear that's agreed to be groomed in order to get scritches and snacks.
That guy is actually a midget and bottle is 250ml.
That dude is well below average size lol
Nice try internet, that's just a tiny man.
Little bit bigger and I can ride it into battle.
No food is safe!
1. Drool
2. Shedding Hair
3. Giant shits
Fun Fact:  When dogs like this get angry, they can knock a person out by slapping you with their tongue, which weighs over 10 pounds.

I totally made this up, in case you were wondering.
I wonder what the life span is for a dog that size.
Doggo can eat my entire body in a single bite
I wanna give him a big hug and just sink into that fluff.
Why do I feel like he‚Äôs not fully grown yet?
FLOOFY BOI I WANT TO PET HIM LET ME PET HIM NOW
Holy hell that is unreal. Imagine that dog chasing you. Just with a less friendly face.
That's not a dog, that's half a bear in a dog disguise
OH LAWD HE COMIN‚Äô
absolute unit
I wanna see its size when wet SO BAD
This is crazy. Bear dog.
Snuggle levels to MAXIMUM!!!
I must have one of these magnificent beasts
Bigger the dog means bigger the snuggles. Very cute
Big dogo, he is so happy üòä
Looks like Barkley from Sesame Street IRL.
Imagine the shits this thing takes!
I've never wanted to cuddle with an animal more than right now.
That is clearly a 1L soda bottle and a very small man next to a slightly large dog.
Pretty sure that‚Äôs a Dire Malamute.
As someone who just lost their dog after 16 years I cannot imagine choosing a type of dog who will only live 8-10.

Also when I see happy healthy dogs I keep picturing them the way my boy looked at the end when he couldn't move or eat.  I hope that stops soon, this big guy is great.

Anyway.
Isn‚Äôt it a Tibetan mastiff?
I actually thought this was fake until the video started that‚Äôs one big chonky boi
That dog is bigger than my future
How cool would it be if it just casually swallowed that dude's soda, bottle and all
pretty sure thats a bear
Shut up that‚Äôs amazingly cute
A neighbor of mine had one that was dark brown. It was really friendly, but when I first saw it I thought it was a bear.
That is never a full Malamute. Tibetan Mastiff mixed 100% sure of it. The body and skull are wrong to be a Malamute.
Oh my god he‚Äòs a huge, fluffy bear!
This dog looks like it belongs to:

A- a Disney princess

B- a anime protagonist 

or C- It‚Äôs not a dog, it‚Äôs a f*cking bear.
You can't fool me, that's an Arcanine
Nice try, but we all know that‚Äôs just a small bear
I wonder if he's related to Clifford
Much dogge
Who‚Äôs a good boy?
How do you get a dog that big?
Wonder what it's like training one of these big pups? He's beautiful.
Its just a short guy grooming that puppy üòÅ
I want to ride this majestic beast into battle!!
What has that dog been eating? Jeez that‚Äôs a big dog
I‚Äôve noticed huge malamutes always seem to be from Asian countries, could htey be like a sub-breed? I had a malamute as a kid, but it wasn‚Äôt this big, and the malamutes I‚Äôve seen in America don‚Äôt seem to get this huge either.
big beautiful huggable lovable wooo woooo mal pal
Omg is that a dog or a bear
Imagine walking that beauty down the street and watching how quickly oncoming pedestrians cross to the other side or just turn around.    In this vid, though, looks so calm and nonthreatening.
I want the big floof
How would you own that thing? You‚Äôd just beit‚Äôs grooming and poop and pee cleaning slave.
IS THIS REAL??
Cuuuuute
Is the malamute behind the furry brontosaurus in the foreground?
That thing must take huge dumps
Omg imagine cuddling with him üòçüòçüòç
Don‚Äôt lie OP.

This is 100% a bear, how dare you assume otherwise!
A horse is a horse, of course, of course, unless it‚Äôs a dog.
Looks like a dire wolf in a fur coat.
Thats massive need a big house for that üêï
You‚Äôre not fooling me, that‚Äôs a bear disguised as a dog
you sure that‚Äôs not a furry?
If it were a darker brown, I'd confuse it for a bear.
this is a real dog right?

a-and isn't a guy in a fursuit right?

RIGHT??
Either that dog is absolutely massive, or whoever cg‚Äôd it has god tier skills.
I LOVE him/her/that/it. Whatever
Good lord I already need a bottle of wine just thinking about grooming him. Back, hands, and arms would be on fire after that!
That's a nice bear
Too MUCH dog..?
A bear would have no chance fighting this guy. Although he seems too nice to fight anyone. He‚Äôs probably become friends with the bear.
uhm, actually this is a bear
99% Bear
1% Dog
Ah, a lap dog! Wonderful
Did it's mother mate with a polar bear or something?! That dog is huge!
Huge is an understatement
Omggggg I want to hug him !
That's one helluva unit of a dog!
Everything is bigger in ~~Texas~~ Alaska
I thought this was fake and then i realized that thing is massive
That's not a Malamute. 

That's Arcanine.
You lie. That's a polar bear you dyed to look like a malamute.
That's a whole lot of love.
That's a big furry car
vvv worm too hot ppz gib haircut
Nope....bear
If I see that thing while going hiking I'd think it was a dman BEAR
Big boy, that smile, that dang smile, he definitely got max two brain cells and its wonderful
This is the biggest dog I have ever seen, what the feck.
That marshmallow could bite his head ofg
Does that tongue have a name too?
How can a bear look like a cute little puppy? 

That is just adorable!
Extra sof and fluffy.
Best dogs in the world. Friendly, good with kids and just enough wolf  in em to scare away creeps.
How much would this dog weigh? Gotta be well over 200 pounds.
Sir, that's a bear.
*IT'S SO FLUFFY!*
I swear to god it‚Äôs not malamute it‚Äôs fucking husky
I see a little silhouetto of a man 

Malamute malamute why

Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me
Ohhh my dog that‚Äôs a big god!!
This dog will take you for a walk
Is this what happens when bears and wolves mate?
It's a legendary WoW mount.
That dog is like oh yes, getting so fresh n so clean clean.
Are you walking them?.... Or are they walking you?

I'm sorry.
The heftiest of chonks
Totally thought this was going to be a r/confusing_perspective!
thats not a dog thats a lion
I grew up with a Malamute and there are few breeds that will suck up to you for love like they do. You also will never stop finding fur in your food. Ever.
Dang.  If I ever managed to get a house with a big ass yard in a cold place I'd totally get one.
Great Grey Wolf Sif
Uhm - that‚Äôs a bear
A wild Arcanine appeared!?
Poor thing must be boiling
My mind will only see a tiny man and a 20oz bottle. üò≥
My parents had a malamute that broke its chain. It would run and jump against the chain for days until it snapped. Then it ate the neighbors goat.
What do you feed that beast?
Look, stop feeding your malamute elephant growth hormone!
https://darkwood-sleddog.tumblr.com/post/181080365190/investigating-east-asian-giant-malamute-types


Mixed with Tibetan Mastiff.
This guy is on steroids
First time I saw one, I was looking out a window at my grandparents house, and all of the sudden this giant head popped out of a car window across the street. It was massive, and I was more concerned on how it got in the car in the first place. Then a few years later, I met the one my boss had. He was this big lazy lump of love and attention. I would love to adopt one, but I will never have the space for one.
Otherwise known as a Direfluff.
He's an undercover Mammoth
You think that puny wall that he's leashed to will stop him?!?
He'd need to eat a whole cow everyday
Put the camera behind the Chinese guy it will look more realistic.
Arcanine irl
Dang it's a bear
Really cute
That dog was actually really small until Emily Elizabeth loved him.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not fat! It‚Äôs just all this fur.... it makes me look.... poofy!‚Äù
That's not a dog, thats a small elephant
Arcanine!
I bet he‚Äôs a great cuddler

Well, that's a huge amount of cuteness right there.

Truly beautiful animal.
I don‚Äôt think they make doggie bags that big!!
Modern use of CGI is just insane.
You can't fool me, thats a miniature bear!!
I have a fear of big dogs but even I have to admit that dog is adorable, such floof
So I can't get a leopard but I can get that beast?
Can it...be delivered to me...when i have a bad day..to cuddle
Malmutes are the true gentle giant of the big dog world.....
I think they mispelled BEAR
It‚Äôs crazy that this is the same species as tea cup chihuahuas
Someone tell the Starks to come pick up their pet!
Poor thing looks so hot. Please don't get Huskies unless you are in a cold or at least temperate climate.
Big Dog With an even BIGGER heart. üòç
That dog is like 1/3 fur!!
Looks fake
That‚Äôs just a really small human standing beside a regular size dog and a 591ml.
The title is bullshit, that‚Äôs a bear.
He look like those chinese guardian lions outside temples and palaces.
THAT IS ADORABLE! ü§óüòò
Looks like a bear disguised as a dog...
Beautiful dogs but I wouldn't want to clean up the 10lb dumps they take daily,  Be like cleaning up after a bear
Had it not been for the man as reference, I could‚Äôve sworn it was a puppy. Look at that face üò≤
That‚Äôs a bear
Growing up there was this big Alaskan Malamute that lived at the house that was right next to my elementary school playground. He was always barking at us as we ran around, and was pretty intimidating because of his size, though I‚Äôm guessing he was actually quite friendly. That dog had to have been 50lbs smaller than this monstrosity! It‚Äôs basically proportionately equal to me now as that old malamute was back when I was in 3rd grade! What a beast!
I would never stop hugging this dog
Holy shit, his tongue is as wide as the dude‚Äôs face.
These new mounts are getting crazy
Holy fuck, for a second I thought for sure this was forced perspective.
**C H O N K**
Idk I couldn't afford to feed this thing and I would hate to pick up his 10 lb poops. 

Props to the people who like big dogs but it ain't for me
I don't think I'm looking at a dog
Imagine. The. Cuddles.
I know everyone seems to have reached the conclusion that this is likely an Alaskan Malamute cross-bred with a Tibetan Mastiff, and the coloration and features do seem to support that; but there *are* Giant Malamutes that are about this size but with a standard coloration and narrower, Malamute-like features. I've seen them firsthand working as sledge dogs in CO, easily exceeding 150 lbs. It's not an AKC-recognized breed, but people have been selectively breeding them for centuries.
He thicc
I love how you can just tell that dog has no concept of how big it is
Is this some kind of Primaris Malamute?
I love how he barely has control over what his tongue is doing.
Omg WHAT A FLUFFY BIGBOYE
where buy
Food bills must be fun! ü§ëüò≤üò≥üòÆ

Careful with them clippers. Pretty sure your head fits in his mouth.

He may have Malamute in him, but that's no Malamute! More like a cross between a Newfoundland and a Chow.

No that‚Äôs a bear
now give him a sword and make him guard the abyss
no fucking way this is real. it's head is like 3x bigger than that guy's
that's a tibetan mastiff.
That is a big dog but it is also forced perspective. I had a Newfoundland that was 100kg or 220 pounds and he was huge. Still did not look as big as this dog in this video.
Smol.
My neighbors malamute is 126 pounds of pure muscle he so gentle though unless he wants to slap you in which case it hurts like hell
How long before the debilitating arthritis kicks in?
Can I get a download of this please
That dog probably won't live to see 8. That was most likely line bread to get it that big.
So question- is the place it's living appropriate climate for its breed? It's like owning a husky while living in Florida- bad for the coat and can easily overheat. Overheating can lead to health complications and failure. Anyways, beautiful dog.
It's a Tibetan mastiff.
He won't live very long, a beaut though.
That dog shouldn't be anywhere where you can comfortably wear a t-shirt, dog must be hot as hell
Just when I get my mind whole, someone post this video again. And üí•ü§Ø
WHAT A GENTLE FLUFFER
OH MY GOD IT LOOKS SO FLOOFY! I WANT IT!

What a cutie and so fluffy. Reminds me of one of my favorite videos of all time. Yogscast kim got the chance to groom a newfoundland with a friend of hers. I still watch it every now and then it it still completely breaks my face when I watch it. Because I'm just grinning ear to ear the whole time while watching it. Big cuddly dogs are so amazing:

That would be a wonderful dog if you lived in Alaska. Looks like it would just love to be pulling on some sleds and sleep in the snow.

Don't you hate it when someone living in a warm climate like California doesn't care and gets the dog anyway?

"Moommm can we get him! We'll keep the AC on and give him ice bath on hot summers" 

Your AC doesn't go to -7F which is what the dog wants.

They're used to be one of those at the dog park and it was both in love with and afraid of my sweet 4lb chihuahua because he stepped on her the first time the met and she gave a warning snap. It was absolutely hilarious to see this giant monster following this tiny dog around and clearly was taking orders from the smaller dog. The AM owner and I became fast friends because of their interactions

Absolutely gorgeous!!
Are malamutes really THIS big?
I feel like this is a scene from "Honey, I shrunk the kids".
I‚Äôd love that dog but if it barked at me I‚Äôd shit myself.
It looks like a puppy; how big will it be when it grows up?
He looks like and is about as big as the Sesame Street dog! Barkley! Soooo cuuuuute!!!
It hurts when my dog step on my nuts,I can only imagine what pain I would feel if he was my dog
I want this dog
I'd love to get an Arcanine

Nice bear.
My friend Joe, has two of these and his good friend had two. Joe had a party one night in the burbs and took all four into his unfenced backyard with leashes in case the dogs had business. 

Those four took off over that wet grass and Joe covered a good area of ground grass-surfing behind them. Joe's strong, so he stayed kind of upright but he had a number of body positions he made there that he felt the next day. It's a sight we will never (let him) forget.
All fluff mine looks the same when she is all primped by the groomers

Is that a pup or a full grown?
Im moving to Alaska, getting one of these, training it as a lapdog, and having a great life.
That's one husky Malamute.
1. How do you afford to feed it?
2. How many mattresses worth of fur does it loose a day?

Alternative headline - person of below average height grooms regular sized dog.
I hate to be ‚Äúthat guy‚Äù but this is edited. Watch the bottle and watch the dogs tongue. It‚Äôs very well done but, it‚Äôs not real.
Why is there a dog being groomed in an abandoned war bombed building.
Beautiful animal requires an ongoing brushing.  The fur could be spun and woven into something very warm.  Just don't get it wet!

Saw one of these up close as a kid and it was twice my size.  Before that big dogs were scary, this dog was a big puppy.  Such a cool dog!
