I‚Äôm consistently amazed by how many different types of beautiful birds there are in existence that I‚Äôve never even heard of.
Strawberry Finches Forever
If I can find a picture of grape jellyfish I'll have a decent start on lunch.

You know what, I'm not deleting this. It's a stupid dad joke but I don't care. I'm proud of it.
I'm no expert but i think that's a bird not a strawberry.
Stained with the blood of his enemies.
Lovely lovely lovely !    Where is this ?
no, that's actually just a raspberry dipped vanilla finch
Looks very close to an avadavat. Are they two different names for the same bird ?
That is serious r/forbiddensnacks material.
This bird looks metal as fuck
The first thing I saw was a Maryland flag
StrawBirby
very very very veeeery beautiful
Looks like a special edition coloured vinyl record.
Looks like it just finished painting its house.
The color pattern variation is mesmerizing!
I've never seen a bird like this before! 

Thanks for sharing!
So beautiful. Going to share with my grandma in Australia who loves birds and birdwatching.
FYI they don't taste like strawberries. Unless you dip them in a sauce, then they do a little but there's still quite an over powering bird flavour to contend with.
Ill take two scoops of finch and some sprinkles please.
Looks like Pokemon
Nature at its best.
Ah I see it's got the Crucible shader on
It looks like the Maryland flag!
Red shirt with leopard print pants? I don‚Äôt think so.
I wonder how much plastic is in its body
But why's it called a strawberry finch?
You are what you eat I guess.
Bbbbb
raspberry dipped finch
I‚Äôve been on here less than four months and this is like the fifth repost of this picture.
Where are these located?
Wasn't this posted like 3 days ago
I WANT ONE!
Strawberry finch forever
Scout Finch?
Looks kinda angry bird
The real question is, does it taste... like strawberry?
where and when can i find them?
Do they really taste like strawberries?
Strawberry finch forever.
Except if you at the feet. Damn birds have the ugliest legs in the animal kingdom.
Good lord! Never have seen such a bird!!
omg so beautiful!!
WHY DID TECHNO AND WILBUR REPOST THIS LOL
This does not change my opinions on birds. . . The red in his eyes stares deep into my soul
[Beautiful Lime Finch](https://i.imgur.com/TYiiDP4.jpg)
Red rum
It's eyes are red like a demon's
Until you know it killed something or someone
Wow!
Beautiful
That‚Äôs amazing!!  Are you the photographer?  My husband likes to make photos of birds on his walks and has been missing that a lot, since most state and local parks are closed.
Damn guy looks like a pokemon
Gorgeous
Wasted opportunity. 

‚ÄúFire Finch‚Äù
genuinely curious where does this bird live   


having a red colour is a missive liability in almost all places   


maybe its seasonal ... it turns red in autumn ?
Is that a fruit? Can I eat it? ÔºàÔºæŒΩÔºæÔºâ
Rasberry dipped Finch
Beautiful Work of Nature. Could be a mutated Cardinal?
Where are you located?    I would love to see a bird like this one day or try to encourage some to live around my home even.
Looks more like a Rasberry Finch
This is just plain majestic
Does he taste like strawberries?
SCREEEE MAJESTIC SCREEE THE ALL FATHER SURE MADE US BEAUTIFUL CAWW CAWWW!
Paging Bob Ross! We found your happy little bird!
Does it taste like strawberries? Can I make a strawberry milkshake with it? Now I want a milkshake . . .
damn, I usually dont give a shit about birds, but that is an amazingly and aesthetically pleasing looking bird
he do be lookin fresh doe
MUM!!! WHY IS MY STRAWBERRY CHRUNCHY!?!?!??!?!
*Edwin Rist has entered the chat*
They should make an online quiz that shows you pictures of exotic birds and asks "Real or photoshop?"
I would legitimately expect this to be some robin that was mutated by a zombie virus and exclusively eats human eyes.
It looks good enough to eat!
Ah yes, the red avadavat. These are usually found in the more tropical areas of Asia. I have some friends that actually kept them in a cage (not sure how I felt about that). It‚Äôs the males that have the bright colors during breading season.
Are you sure that's strawberry jam. Doesn't look like it to me
Reminds me of a Maryland flag
I'm pretty sure my cat killed one of these this spring.   I almost cried it was so beautiful.
That doesn‚Äôt look like anything to me.
I heard it could throw a shoe over a pub. 

Science. Science and nature.
But is it strawberry flavored?
Read that as beautiful strawberry fish and was very confused
Nature creates most beautiful colors combination!
This bird bathes in the blood of his enemies... BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!!!
.....can I eat it?....
if these live in MD, I'd be fighting to make it the new state bird
r/birdwatching would love this too!
Lol my first thought is to wonder if this is photoshopped but it is very pretty
Do you have a high rez pic would make nicewalloaper
I‚Äôve never heard of these before! It‚Äôs sooo cute! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Archimedes, no! It's filthy in there!"
im truly amazed at the beauty of this bird. such an interesting specie i must say.
Nature is so Awesome!
I didn't know these existed üòç
He's about lost his balls
I have never seen anything like that
I love the white dots.  Reminds me of a young deer.  I think it would make a perfect design for a squishable.
Oooo, I know what I‚Äôm drawing later
It looks like it pecked it‚Äôs way into somebody‚Äôs skull to get a gooey red snack, then pulled out again and didn‚Äôt bother washing away the evidence.
Finches are some of the coolest looking birds. 

We get some gold finches and house finches in the backyard. Beautiful. But this guy here looks really special. 

Thanks for sharing.
My grandmother LOVED watching the birds and thought it was cute, but it wasn't included much.  A few years ago, someone gave me a bird feeder for a hidden santa exchange, and so I was done and I hung in the spring.  While working from home, I moved it out of the window of my work area so I can open and close all day long.  I looked at a group of birds online that I didn't know were in this area.  It's pretty cool.  This morning, I had two cardinals (a man and a woman), four grackles, a mourning dove and also a squirrel.  And I become my grandmother.
Now the question is, does it taste like a strawberry?
I love this red colour
It looks delishos (I would not eat it thow)
Let me take you down cause I'm going to...
I've seen a lot of finches but never one like this.

Thanks
Wow I have never seen one of those before
I am also curious if this is a male or female AND if both genders are this vibrant. Awesome picture.
This picture makes me crave the raspberry dipped vanilla ice cream cone even more.
Beautiful is an understatement. Where are those known to be found?
Wonder what it tastes like
Caution, do NOT dip in chocolate.
Amazing, beautiful, magical .... such a perfect name for this wonderful creature.
A horse will think it's a strawberry and eat it
I feel like a goddamn geriatric for liking birds so much.
Do you know how to hide an elephant in a cherry tree? Put red shoes on it
It looks like this bird flew at super Speed and went through someone's body being drenched in blood
I know bird watching and clicking them is a tough job. Lovely pic bro
[removed]
I love birds too and I get so much peace and enjoyment watching them. We recently put a hummingbird feeder and a regular feeder right outside our living room window. It‚Äôs pretty cool to be sitting on the sofa and watch a hummingbird light on the feeder and then zoom off.
It looks like that finch flew into a strawberry bush and didn't take a bath afterwards.
They should make this an animal crossing villager! It would be best friends with meringue (frosting and strawberry rhino)
Really? This post again? How many times is this strawberry finch gonna be reposted?
Almost became a cardinal but alas!
They used to try to beat up my cats. They‚Äôre like mockingbirds.
I didn‚Äôt know this bird existed
[removed]
This is actually a mutation of a strawberry finch, and before you start looking for them here, their range is southern Nepal and Pakistan through much of Southeast Asia to Indonesia.
All we need now is some peanutbutter finch and bread finch
There's no way this doesn't make a sticky mess lol, no ty.


Edit:wrong post, fuck it.
I recently discovered my love for birds. They are so intelligent & unique. I moved to a very bird heavy area and it's been a joy. Especially during the quarantine.
wow even the eyes are red
garnished with sesame seeds and ketchup
Serial killer eyes haha
 The red avadavat, red munia or strawberry finch, is a sparrow-sized bird of the family Estrildidae. It is found in the open fields and grasslands of tropical Asia and is popular as a cage bird due to the colourful plumage of the males in their breeding season.
Beautiful indeed! Thank you for sharing!
Does no one see the skull face pattern on this bird, or am I just being morbid?
You are in tropical Asia?
üé∂ strawberry wine....

I can listen he's PRRR
Are all these new birds being released into the wild while we are in quarantine? Government was able to track the bodies and replace the batteries finally?
This is one of the prettiest birds I have ever seen.
Beautiful. I have no idea
nah thats blood, the thing just went through someones chest.
I dunno, looks more like Cherry Garcia if you ask me.
If i get revived into an animal, i definitivly want to be a Bird who looks like ist just penetrated a Way bigger animal with its head
watch out for that thorn, birb
Completely photoshopped! Ha ha üòÇ
Evil red eyed, strawberry colored sparrow...
This is just a regular finch with a Chaos skin
Can we get some specs on the camera/lens?
Bird relaxing after the slaughter of a thousand children
Wow! I've never heard of or seen this bird before.
Oh ma god
God, you are amazing! No artist that ever lived can top YOU!
I used to have a zebra finch named Jorje. He was so cute, and would happily chirp away while hopping between the branches in his cage, and would let me hand-feed him millet. It's unfortunate that they only live about 2 years, but I loved that little guy while he was with me. This bird is beautiful, and makes me miss Jorje.
##Crunch
Very pretty ty
Lets make strawberry milkshake
