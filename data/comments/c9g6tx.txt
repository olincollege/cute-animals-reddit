All my cat did when we moved was scream for 3 hours
Years ago I had a Ragdoll (like yours) that went to work with me. He hated the carrier but was fine loose in my truck. Even slept on the dash a few times when parked. Car cats are so unique.
[What a great way to handle traveling together :)](https://i.imgur.com/yxkn6Ug.jpg)
Adopted her at age 3 a year ago and now have to move 400 miles. I started bringing her along because I would be away for a week or more while visiting my girlfriend and had no one to watch her, turns out she absolutely loves car rides. She hated the carrier so much that I decided to give her a chance while I drove around locally as a test, turns out she lays down in her little bed and just watches and sleeps most of the time, and never moves around the car while it is in motion. I'm also getting a ton of questions about the car too, so if anyone has any questions on the car I can try to answer, but the /r/teslamotors subreddit is probably a better spot to go. I'm a bit spammed with questions at the moment.

&#x200B;

EDIT: To post one more picture. I was a bit hesitant, but the one time she stood up to check out what I was doing while I was driving was too cute to not take a quick picture of. I promise it was just a 1 handed quick snap, and that I didn't take my focus off the road while the car was on autopilot... so please don't crucify me. :)

EDIT2: To answer some common questions: She is a "Siamese Snowshoe Mix" according to the adoption agency. I have no better idea than that!  Car is a Tesla Model 3 in Dog Mode. She is extremely docile in the car and never leaves her area, or else I would have put her in a carrier for safety.

EDIT3: Final picture! Some are claiming I am not the ~~owner~~ chauffeur, so I went ahead and took a picture. I hope you are happy with yourselves, she does not like being woken up!  :P

Does anyone know if the Tesla is recording actual temperature in the car or just the set point? Like, if the AC breaks will the number start going up and then display a big flashing warning above a certain temp?
Thought that said 71 celcius for a sec lol
What it says on that screen though. I feel like every pet owner should have that.

Edit: I didn't know it was a Tesla feature, not that great with cars, but I learned something new!
This car looks extremely foreign to me, what is it?
I moved nearly 1200 miles with my cat and the poor little anxious guy sat on my lap with his face buried in the crook of my elbow the entire time.
I moved 3 blocks and my cat shit his cage on the 2 minute drive
I would move 400 miles 

And I would move 400 more

Just to be the man to move 800 miles

With a cat on my floorboard
Not sure if this has been answered yet, but what breed is your cat? It‚Äôs beautiful
That sign is such a great idea!  My husband and I will be moving from Kentucky to Colorado soon, but our cat is not a car ride lover!
The dog mode in Tesla's cars is genius
for safety, even just for the case of a crash. I would reccomend at least some kind of restraint. My dog can move around but has a harness that clips in to a seatbelt. Dont want kitty getting thrown against the front of the car :(
You don't have to travel with your cat, you GET to travel with your cat
Is that a Tesla? And it has an integrated "Im Okay, my Owner will be back soon" mode? This is awesome :D
Tie pieces of ribbon (or tape if you don't mind the potential of glue residue) to the vents so people can see the air moving. It might save a window. People like to act like heroes.
The inside of Tesla looks so futuristic
What type of car you got?
But how does the ac stay on then? I feel so silly lol am I missing something?
Read the title as "Time traveling with my cat" saw you were in a Tesla... Yeah, that's probably right.
Love the fact that the Tesla has a pet mode to take care of pets in the car.
Sorry if it's been answered, but how'd you handle the poopin'? I've often tried to figure out how traveling with my cats might work.
Tesla out here making moves. Dog mode is so lit and actually proves that Tesla understands teh future
71¬∞F sounds a lot, but it‚Äôs like 21¬∞C
Bruh the inside of the car looks neat
How do you keep your car on and locked at the same time? Also - how did you get that message on the screen?
Dude I moved to a different city that was 1.5 hours away and my cat made it a nightmare.  The noises that came out of his mouth still haunt me to this day.

Still love that lil bastard.
the ac is on and he's listening to his favorite music
I left my dog in the car with the windows cracked and the AC on full blast while I ran in the store.  Police still were called....I guess they didn‚Äôt notice the exhaust or hear the vehicle running.
Ok but seriously- what kind of car is that?? I have a screen like that in my new car but dont know if i can project that kinda thing on it. Its friggin amazing!

*edit- op has a tesla and thats why even the fanciest car ive ever owned will never be nearly as cool. *
Teslas are so friggin cool man
I had to move with my cat just a couple cities over and she HATED it. Clawed up onto my shoulder and proceeded to fear-shit all over me. Still love her
I need this!  For real.  Is it a Tesla thing or can it be purchased as stand-alone?
is that a tesla omg
What car is this and can you adopt me?
I love this cat.
No *boom boom* or *vroom vroom* to scare kitty.
LPT: When moving with your cat use a Tesla
The message on the screen is an amazing idea!
Gotta love a Tesla
#_SMASHES WINDOW TO SAVE CAT_
I hate to be "that guy," but if you are transporting a cat in a car, it's much safer for the cat to have the cat in a carrier. You can use a large one for more room to move around. 

All it takes is one tiny mistake, and the cat is out of the car and lost. I've seen so many heartbreaking posts from people who've lost their cats during a move because the cat got out of the car, got scared, and ran off. It also gives them more protection in the event of an accident.  

Please transport your cats in carriers at all times!
I think OP just wanted to flex on us with his Tesla
Your cat rocks by the way. Max adorbs
My main question is can you pop in a store to use the restroom and leave the car on and locked? Haha that would be a big selling point for us traveling pet owners. PS your baby is beautiful üòÅ
Ship, keep summer safe. 

_keep summer safe_
Very interesting desgn, is this a tesla?
Reddit does love their Tesla's.
Came for the pet, upvoted for the 3.
Dude, that "my owner will be back soon" thing is revolutionary. I have never seen one before!
71 degrees is subjective. The cat might prefer 68. Lets break in boys!
When my kitty was younger she'd crawl up on my neck and be like a warm scarf the whole ride. It wasn't safe, I know, but she seemed so happy and I tried to be super cautious. 

Now she's older, and I put her in a carrier, and she yowls and vomits :(
We moved my daughters 5 cats 1700 miles. We had them in a huge wire dog crate in the back of a suv. They had shelves to sit on, food, water, a litter box. We expected the worse, we were sure there would be pandemonium but they just hung out and watched the world go by. 

The 1st night they spent in the cage in the suv and the second night we brought them in the hotel room and they ran wild. They needed that. 

Very pleasant trip.
Wow every car should have this feature
I just can't get over how awesome this set up. You turned the entire floor into her little cubby even with her bed. You have a freaking huge display to let others know she is ok. Food, water blanket. Why do I get the feeling it took more time to set her stuff up than it did to pack everything else. lol
Omggggg is that a tesla what a cute message
After going through this thread I realized how many people know nothing about teslas, I figured the big screen was dead giveaway.
I've been driving a lot of high end vehicles for my new job and this one specific feature (not the animal specific one but the temperature control) is what makes me want a tesla. I HATE getting into my car on a hot morning wearing my work clothes. Feel clammy all day long.
**C**ats prefer **C**elsius. 

Do you have to take her out for a walk to pee or does she have a sandbox somewhere in the car?  

And why do I know she's a female just by looking at her?
Nice flex!
Lucky you. I have been thinking of moving from Tampa Florida to Iowa, and my cat gets so severely stressed she drools like crazy. I'm thinking of drugging her up for the trip, I'd really rather not too but don't see another solution. :( Wish she at least tolerated it lol.   


Gorgeous cat by the way!
that cat looks cosy
I'm going to assume that's a Tesla and it's pretty cool that it has that notification so people won't freak out and break your window haha
Hey, what is your car?! I know it's a Tesla but what model is it?
How do ppl leave the ac on without worrying if someone is going to steal from their car? When I leave my pet in the car, I have a separate portable fan
Is she cross eyed?
Dude this screen is the size of my TV..
This is your insurance against broken glasses
Does your car have a "leave the pet comfortable" setting? Because that is a feature I didn't know I needed.
btw i own a tesla
That‚Äôs one good thing about Teslas, you can leave the aircon on without having to leave the vehicle ‚Äúon‚Äù and don‚Äôt have to worry about the fumes recirculating in the cabin.
I like that display with a message and temperature. People be breaking into cars trying to save pets without calling animal control and shit.
I had to move all 3 of my cats 10 miles to a new house.  It sounded like a ambulance
Of course the cat's happy!  They get to straight ball in a Tesla for a few days, who wouldn't be?
Traveling with pets god level

Seriously yall take care of your fur babies and your actual babies this summer it's supposed to be a hot one.
Your cat's eyes are awesome
71 ¬∞F ‚âà 22 ¬∞C

I'm not a bot and this action was performed compulsively. If you have any doubt, please contact u/Llodsliat.
AC without the keys in?
My parrot won't let me fucking exist if I don't let him stay on my shoulder. He loved standing on my shoulder.
Is that a smart car or somethin?
Hey I have a question about bathroom breaks for the cat. Do you have a litter box in the back or something? Or you just stop at a rest area and let the cat out to pee/poop?
Metric gang where you at?
Cool still breaking your window to pet her
Must know what kind of car this is and how you got it to display that screen!
I'm about to move house, just over 160 miles with two cats tomorrow, I doubt I will be so lucky..
All my cats do is scream in the car the whole time. At least my dog is cool with it. He likes car rides.
I collected my rescue kitty and drove 3 hours to get her home.  She talked to the Sat nav (cat nav?) all the way home.  If we need to take her anywhere in the car now, we put it on and it chills her out.
‚ÄúLooks like we got a bit of Siamese in ya, let‚Äôs just go ahead and cross those eyes to the proper amount of adorable.‚Äù
So no one us wondering what kind of car has a laptop screen built into the dashboard, eh?
So, uh... how do you enjoy having money?
Nice Model 3
Weird way to flex a Tesla.
Oh shit, what a car! This picture just called me poor lol
Hey guys... this humblebrag Tesla has a cat.
Is this about your cat or about your car?
Just curious. Where‚Äôs the litter box?
Would you move 400 more?
Holy crap. This totally feels like corporate product placement. Every comment near the top sounds fake, and people just so happen to be asking about what car it is and OP is saying things like, its only 35k as if it were a selling point.

Not saying it is. But come on.
Left cat in car with "dog mode" enabled? Are you a madlad?
Very sly way to flex you have a tesla on reddit...  have an upvote
I‚Äôm about to move 2,100 miles away with my cat and I hope she handles the car ride this well üòä
I mean I'd f%$#ing love it too with that set up.
Im sorry i have to ask. Where does she poop
Can we do this with kids now or it is still frowned upon?
Id love them too if i had a teslaüòç how do you like it?
Whoa the new iPhone plus screen is even bigger this year
What year Tesla? Does the 2014 have this feature?
Is your car a Tesla on dog mode?
Beautiful cat
**71! ** the cat is going to melt
Everything about this makes me feel so fucking warm and fuzzy
That‚Äôs a hella nice interior!
Car cats are the best! They make great travel buddies.
Love the white interior. What did you wrap the center console with?
I tried this with my cat and she pissed on the floor mat in the passenger side
Is driving the Tesla 400 miles annoying? I mean you have to stop and charge for how long before continuing on. I want a Tesla but the limit of miles per charge stops me and the dumb price tag for the best miles per charge.
I wish my cat could handle car rides. He shits and vomits simultaneously every time.
Cute crossed eyed.  Siamese mix?
If I rode on the same spot as the cat I would love car rides too
OP is awesome for taking care of their kitty so well.
WHY AM I SO EMOTIONAL THIS IS THE CUTEST THING EVER
It‚Äôs cool that it shows that the cats are safe
Where does it shit?
I drove over 2,500 miles from Portland, Maine to Austin, TX in March and brought down my siamese as well, and she loved it! She just decided to accept it as our new way of life, and loved it. My setup was very similar to yours :) somethin bout those siamese, they just love adventure!
My cats like car rides to an extent. They'll alternate between sitting in the back seat and crying and climbing up front so they can look out through the windows.
My cat has moved over 10 times with me. Little guy is a trooper in the car, especially when it was 400 miles in a truck with a dog. I don't deserve that cat. <3 

Best of luck in your new move!
This cat looks photoshopped into the pic.
Where is the litter box
I definitely have a thing for crossed eyed cat. If not too bad for them it just make them 2x cuter.
I love his/her little cross-eyes. So blue and cute !
Aw. I flew my cat 7 hours to the US to be with me. He apparently just slept through it.
What an adorable cat! She's beautiful!
My wife and I drove over 3000 miles with her two cats. One of the had some kind of kitty epiphany in the Black Hills. He was glued to the windows the whole time and he was like a different cat afterwards. He was more confident and more alive. I miss that doofus everyday.
Wow, Tesla tablet is pretty neat
Looks like you gave her luxury accommodations. Of course she‚Äôs content. You do love your kitty!
my cat does fine in the car until we get on the freeway and he screams the whole way lmao
I mean I would also love that car. It's got a little bed and food and water and everything.
We had to move cross country once with 2 cats. My mother strung up a netting to keep them out of the front seats. We drove like this for a week, the cats were fine. We stayed in a hotel for a few weeks because our house wasn't ready. When it was time to move in, we kept the cats in carriers because it was ten minutes away and we didn't want to put the net back up. In those ten minutes,  the cats both vomited twice, and one crapped himself.
I drove 6 hours when I adopted my cat and she was amazing the whole ride. Now anytime she gets in a car she screams and poops
I love this cats eyes. So hilarious. My cat is also really good in cars. She sleeps in my lap most of the trip and pops her head up at drive throughs to get pets from strangers.
One time I traveled 45 minutes with my cat in my lap because she seemed to able to handle a car ride outside the cat carrier. 

I arrived at my destination piss soaked from the waist down. 

We both had a bath that day.
I regularly (every couple of weeks) take my kitten to visit my aging parents since I live in the city and have no friends or relatives to cat-sit....the drive is 2-3 hours but he ends up sleeping the entire time. Haven't heard a single meow or growl or hiss in the car.
Are there options in modern cars, to not have a big touch screen tablet as the center console? im happy with just a little digital clock that switches to a radio when i change the station.
A few years ago, I travelled with my cat from upstate NY to Florida. I was stressed and asked the vet for medication, which my cat barely swallowed and proceeded to throw up in my car within the first five minutes. Once we started moving though, he just lay on my shoulders or my lap for the whole ride without making a sound. I stopped a few times, pulled out his litter box and he immediately did his business. Couldn't believe how chill my baby boy was. Lost him to an undiagnosed heart disease at only 2 years old. He was an awesome cat.
My dad‚Äôs cat has to ride in in the crate because she shits herself and has an absolutely terrible time in the car :(.
I hate to argue with a sign, but looks like the owner is there and his pet human has escaped.
Is that screen a function of the Tesla?  If so, great idea.

If not, good PhotoShoppin'!
You are a great car parent! I take off my to you sir or ma'am. Thank you for being awesome
Using Dog Mode on your Model 3 for a cat is not something I ever thought would happen. My cats HATE car rides. :/

Yours looks very comfortable, though. :)
What if he activates the self-driving function and ends up speeding, who gets the ticket?
Just completed a 2900 mile cross country move last night with two cats. One was quiet the entire time. The other wailed like a banshee until she put herself to sleep each day.
Most cats probably think, when you get them in the car, they're going to the vet.

The longer car ride, the bigger the vet.
Tesla did good. This came out from a tweet to elon. He said ok. This was made.
Smart and beautiful cat!!
Favorite thing about Teslas
oh yeah, don't teslas have a new pet mode or something.
I travel for work and usually I board my pets when I need to fly. The cat started losing weight every time he was boarded. With travel coming up, I requested permission to drive more than 2k miles one way and took the pets on a 2 week multi-state adventure that included 6 days of work. The cat travels amazingly...just snuggles his blanket and little backpack. He also really seemed to enjoy exploring the hotels.
My daughter drove her cat from Montreal Canada to Baltimore, Maryland. 
Her cat cried a mournful wail the entire way, the ENTIRE way.
The cat is precious
Why don't all cars have a pet mode, or at least a way to keep the interior cool?
/u/Ivangreatness24 we need this setup for Minou when we move out
Cuteee
My rescue cat Pinky (he lived to the age of 26), loved to go for car rides :)
I miss that boy ‚ù§Ô∏è
We moved 750 miles, and my hubby first dropped myself, the kids, and the dog off. Then he headed back to get the cats (a friend was watching them in the meantime). I think it took about 3 days after he got home for the haunted look to fade from his face. He was adament he is never travelling with cats again lol I can't even begin to imagine what the trip was like, especially as he's not a fan of my cats to begin with. I anticipate he had the music blasting the whole time.
I don't know if it's the angle or the eyes themselves....

but your cat looks adorably derpy.
Ok thanks. Massive screen.
They should make more devices like this that show the temp of the car for animals and kids.
It's all fun and games until kitty gets an upset stomach :/
Your car looks so cool.
This is so nice
I‚Äôm moving from NYC to California and my dogs have been sleeping on our way back! Love the dog mode! In your case Cat mode!!! Currently in Badlands National Park South Dakota!
I love that there's a big ass screen right there because you just KNOW people are going to see an animal and the first thing they are going to do is look through the windows to see any signs of airflow if the windows aren't down.
Can someone edit this to an absurd number like 138?
Our cat is the opposite. We travel with her a fair amount (we go back to my girlfriend's parents house every summer in southern France with a huge garden she loves to prowl around in, where she was actually born, and we take her with us. Inside her box she is fine, she just sits and waits - meows at us when we talk to her (we talk to her a lot so she knows we are thinking of her).   


We experimented with opening the carrier in the car to see what she did, but she never wanted to come out. We stopped at a gated area in switzerland once and sat in the grass with her, and saw if she wanted to just stretch her legs, or go pee or anything - she resolutely stayed in the box and stared at us as if we were idiots.  


Then normally, when we were about 100km away from our destination we would get to the sea - and here she would start to meow excitedly. Presumably she recognized the small and knew we were really there, it is always a cute moment.
I've always wondered when I see posts like this saying the A/C is on while the owner is away from the car.  

How do you leave the A/C running without leaving the car running (and the keys in the ignition)?  

I know nothing of cars so no idea how it works.
OP is just trying to flex on us.
Love tesla!!!!!!
when there's a cat that's been in a tesla before you üò©üôÉ
Meanwhile my cat has to ride in the back of the moving truck because she screeches literally the whole time she's not in the house.
My cat howls like a demon if I put him in the car. Mainly because he knows he's not going anywhere nice.
I love how Tesla has the pet mode
This is brilliant design.
I'm amazed at how boring and bland the interior of a tesla is.
That's an awesome feature the Tesla has. Elon must have thought of everything.
Animals that don‚Äôt get much time outside (like most indoor cats) love car rides, especially the vibration of the car as it moves.  It relaxes them.
She‚Äôs gorgeous! What a sweet little buddy. üòç
Asking a serious question. What is that HUGE screen on the dashboard & why does it say my owner will be back?
Is that one of the Durex balloon animals on that sign?  Those commercials are hilarious.
Awww it‚Äôs so cute that you have a little set up for her right on the floor of the car ü•∞ and she‚Äôs a beautiful cat, love her fur colour.
Im worried whats 71F in Celsius
What wrap do you have in your center console? Need to get rid of that shiny piano black
How do you do this . . . keep the car running?
You are a wonderful fur Mom that thought of everything! Kudos to you!!
We get it - you have a Tesla. You‚Äôve saved earth and the animals.

The car has a pet mode with a note on the screen??? 

It just fucking blows my mind how far ahead of the game tesla is on basic quality of life shit like this.

How fucking hard is it to put a large, iPad like screen in a car? We literally spend all our time in the things interacting with them, yet even luxury car interfaces are absolute trash.

I sat down in a C-series a couple years ago to test drive and it had a tablet fucking glued to the dashboard. I immediately reached up to start tapping on it and... Nothing happened. Because it wasn't a touch screen. It was controlled by some God awful alien sex aid looking club foot thing in the middle of the centre console.

I have not willingly sat in one since.
Ok your cat is cute but Tesla has gotten out of hand with the screen size. That thing looks massive and distracting.
I love this. So much.
I also have a ragdoll (our best guess, since we don't really have a clue, but colouring is same as yours just long haired) that loves car rides!
Thats one handsome codriver!
What beautiful eyes.
I can never see a balloon puppy anymore without thinking of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcGhTO8yVgM) Durex commercial.
Wholesome and adorable!
My cat used to love car rides too. She would sit on the ledge between the front and the back, unless she was tired when she would curl up on my lap while I drove. Very cute cat you have there! 10/10
/r/WeGetItYouDriveATesla
So jelly of ur tesla
Beautiful kitty
You are so lucky! My old boy was not happy the entire 5 hour car ride home.
Those eyes :O
I really hope your cat is named Nikolai!
First time i've seen a cat in a car,
awwww, that is cute!
s/driver/chauffeur
That face holds so much love oml ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Nice! My cat is a terrible traveller. When we moved 30 minutes away, she had a meltdown in the car.
I want your life
How did you get this setup with the temperature? Also, did you just leave the engine running then?
That's so cute!
That is such a sweet set up! üòç
Such a sweetheart.
Crazy how i know its probably an okay temp, but 71 still sounds hot as hell
My husband and I drove about 4500km when we moved across country, with the cat.

The first day she stressed out, but as soon as we let her out of the cage she calmed down a lot and seemed to enjoy herself, sprawled out on the dashboard in the sun.
My parents used to have a cat that would climb up and drape across my dad's shoulders while he drove, so he could look at the cars out the drivers side window. Lots of kids in backseats would wave and occasionally he'd get a honk.
Aww, I love her little crossed eyes!!  So precious!
She looks like she's having fun :) also love the tablet so people know she's doing fine!
I see you‚Äôre using the Keep Summer Safe mode.
Doesn't leaving the A/C on drain your car's battery? I was taught that you should never let the AC running if the car's engine isn't on.

EDIT: I guess this is not an issue with teslas.
This is beautiful. My cat gets sick in the car.
What kind of analyses are you running while you drive?!? That is an impressive dashboard.
Your cat‚Äôs eyes are prettier than mine.
I never got these. As far as I know, here in the Netherlands, the AC only blows cold air when the motor is running (with the keys in the ignition). Otherwise it'll eventually just blow hot air. Is that different in the US? I can't imagine these people leaving their car running with the keys in ignition while they're out grocery shopping üòÖ
An absolutely stupendous r/catloaf
Thats how you take care of your pets, everyone
I‚Äôd love car rides if I had that setup also
She looks adorable.

Based on her eyes, I'm guessing you are a meat-popsicle?
Lucky...Mine makes noises that terrify my, so he's not allowed to roam around the car on his own...Fortunately, he loves his carrier and will settle into it like it's own little cave.
Lucky, when I moved my cat was literally loosing it the whole way. I eventually had to keep him in his carrier to make sure he wouldn't jump out of my lap and start running all over the car like crazy trying to get out. Yeah not the best 14 hour drive I've had.
What breed of cat is she? She's absolutely adorable!
She looks like a well behaved cat loaf. \^\_\^
I dunno how I feel about having a large-ass monitor like that.
My cat hates the carrier as well so I got her a harness and seat belt which the dog also has. It‚Äôs fun to watch her looking at stuff go by.
I am 99% sure I've seen this cat before. I don't know where
Love it! We bought a soft carrier for ours and we buckle it in. And we keep it open for the cat to sleep, but we don't let her out to move around. She can stay in the carrier or in the back seat on the floor boards. She seems to like it too! Even uses the litter box when we stop along the way
Awwww what an adorable derpy eye.
Adorable
What kinda car is this?
Nice to see people have bigger screens in their fucking  car than I have at home
r/catloaf
That is awesome! Your kitty is traveling with all of the comforts of home! He/she is gorgeous! Good luck on your travels!
If you use your imagination or halucinigens it looks like your cats bed is a giant fish coming up from the abyss to eat your cat lol.
Yep it‚Äôs summertime.
That's a cool car feature (on the screen)
Maybe the EV drive train is less disturbing than conventional.
I have a cat that loves car rides. If the dogs go to the bark park then he had to go for a ride or he pouts for hours!
This...this is good
How does she shit?
That's awesome!!  And impressive. I just moved 96 miles and my cats were awful. Which was expected since they misbehave just going to the vet.
I tried having my cat loose in the car one time late at night on a relatively empty street.  Wanted to see if he would like it.  He instantly wrapped himself around my neck and headrest while digging his claws in.  Experiment failed. 

Thankfully his vet is close because he howls like a banshee in his cat carrier.
I travel with two dogs, and I leave the car running and tape a note to the window that says please don‚Äôt break my windows the motors on in the air-conditioners running.
and the litterbox is in the back seat?
I sits and curl my foots an watch you drive human
Yeah im surprised more Tesla windows are not being broken by people thinking they are saving an animal when the car is in pet mode. That display that shows passersby the temp and mode is a nice idea.
What do you do for a litter box?
Loaf
Those are the most gorgeous eyes Ive ever seen. Human or cat.
I had a beloved cat who loved to ride in the car (as long as she wasn‚Äôt in a carrier). I still miss taking her on drives.
Lucky, I'm thankful how good my cat is on car rides but she lets me know how much she hates it.
I've definitely dreamed of this
What's that in normal people temperature?
Cross eyed, Cross country kitty.
Looks like a snowshoe
I love the dedication and the sign ‚ù§
I had a beloved cat who loved to ride in the car (as long as she wasn‚Äôt in a carrier). I still miss taking her on drives.
I know most people are probably awwing at the cat but I'm awwing at the tesla üòç
Stay away from that car!
I‚Äôm not an expert but your cat may need glasses.
Is that...... A tesla? They're honestly really cool cars and i want one lol
Fraking adorable.
CUTE KITTYYYYY
Of course he liked riding in a car as nice and quiet as a Tesla lol
What car is this??
What a pretty kitty!
Nice car
Really cute and heartmelting!
This is awwwdorable!
Your cat is beautiful!
He's just in the optical shop buying me corrective lenses.
Your kitty is absolutely beautiful and looks like the perfect travel buddy. We did a 2000+ mile, 6 day move with our cats, and none of them hated the car, thank God! My older girl cat wasn't super thrilled but my boys just passed out and slept all day, or chilled in the back seat.
Is that a Tesla? That would be so useful you could turn on autopilot and just give her pets
What's not to like, chilling with your human all day
he‚Äôs just looking like chill dude i‚Äôm good
You give me hope, we move 1500 miles with our dogs via car in October and I'm really hoping they look has chilled and happy as your cat
For a second I read 71 C¬∞, I was about to have a heart attack.
I, surprisingly care more about your tesla
Someone gonna talk shit cause you called yourself the cats ‚Äúowner‚Äù and not that you are it‚Äôs parent (adopter).
This cat is a spy, no real cat enjoys a car ride.  Kind of like a granny that can‚Äôt cook.  Spy.
How many times did you have to charge it and how long did it take and how much did it cost.
That reminds me of my last cat Max who loved car rides! He traveled with me across all of America many times as I traveled for work. Here's a picture of him on his way to Georgia 2 years ago. https://i.imgur.com/7WcnQaZ.jpg

I wish you two happy travels :)
I moved 5km away last month and my cat lost her god damn mind in the 12 minute drive. She sounded like she thought she was dieing.
I think a good solution will be to support mnk in consoles and pair them with other mnk players, even pc.
The cat is adorable, but what car do you have?
When my cat traveled with us 3k miles (west coast to east) he really didnt care at all. He would just walk around at our feet and hop over the chairs to eat food and use the litter box in the back of the car
Beautiful cat AND a Tesla. This guy won.
Mine also loves them. She likes to ride my shoulders like a scarf and look out the window
Took my cat on a 1600 mile trip (twice, about 8 years apart).  I set up a little box in the passenger foot well, food and water in the back and a bed in her cage.  She spent most of the trip sleeping in my lap.  I remember getting a very strange look from a toll booth attendant in Delaware.
Do all their models do this?
Those blue eyes üòª And kudos to you on taking amazing care of your fur baby! ü•∞
/r/catloaf
Look at that adorable derp face.
[Here's mine at 14, about half way back from France (to the UK..), in a slightly more indelicate position](https://i.imgur.com/jnnQ9n1.jpg). For context, I'd normally stop somewhere fairly rural, park up and find somewhere relatively secluded for food and so on, but this was just before we hit the ferry so there weren't a huge number of options time wise and she had to make do. Litter tray in the footwell, food in the boot area. I should add that when driving she's in a fairly large sealed basket (and usually sleeps) so not loose in the cabin, and whenever we are out and about like this she's in a high vis jacket.
Responsible and adorable fur baby parent!
good idea using that tablet screen. whenever i have to leave my dog in a car (AC on, music playing etc) i‚Äôm terrifies that someone‚Äôs going to break in
My cat does too! We drove 5000 miles for a road trip and he just loved it
That screen is worth every penny.
What car model is this
I used to take my 19 yr old 3-legged kitty in the car with me on every road trip because she was always more stressed when I left her than when she was in the car with me. Have a happy kitty road trip!!
This must be Charly!
Wow that is an adorable cat! Those eyes!
ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è : we are going to have to break the window
ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è : did you read the message on the dash?
ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è : smash!
The cat is gorgeous :(
Tesla pls cat mode
Does your cat have marbles for eyeballs?!?!
My heart-
Sorry about ur window cuz I'm petting that cat.
Well I would love car rides too with a luxe set up like that
GG
OP, what kind of car do you have that has that cool of a screen?
üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏èüëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôd die for this cat
Is your cat crosseyed or is it just the way the picture was taken that makes me think that.
The car doesn, t has a gasoline smell and is not noisy.  Maybe that's why.
What did you do with the litter?
Is that a Tesla?
Watch some jackass bust your window and steal him anyways.
That cat deserves a treat
She cross eyed? How does it affect her eye sight or ability to focus?
God damn I love Tesla's you go my guy.
That‚Äôs a pleasant surprise:)
What do you do about the litter box?
Real question, how‚Äôs driving 400 miles in a Tesla going?
Great set up. They are comfortable making life easy. Nice traveling companion
So awesome that she enjoys being in the car! What kind of car do you have?
I am planning on moving a considerable distance (driving) in the next few years. I have two cats. How did you handle yours having to go to the bathroom? 

Absolutely adorable cat!!!
Awe that‚Äôs a sweet thing to do
PSA to everyone mentioning moving with their cats:  before moving, ask your vet about anti-anxiety meds. They will make sure it's okay for your cat, and your cat will be much less terrified. Also works for doggos.
Finally, a device that can translate cat language to English
Nice cat
God, I moved ten miles last summer and my dog could not handle the car ride
2 minutes later you'll have the fire department there and some bashing your windows anyway
[deleted]
Wow. Really nice fur and awesome eyes.
well worth a tesla now..
The screen should have also a timer saying how long the owner has been away.
where does a cat pee on a road trip
Just moved, only drove 30 miles. My cat screamed and clawed my neck the entire time
Sweet baby blues üòç
cross-eyed siamese!

adorable!
this is an amazing idea to properly take care of your family pet
good old Tesla
Some cats just love to drive! My Maine coon loves being in the car and watching the scenery.
I love the Cozy Cave!
Whip a Tesla
Handsome car but i am more interested in your 400miles trip in a Tesla, do you need to plan charging station?
That feature for the Tesla cars is amazing.
Yeah my Beagle was amazing during the 15 hour round trip to Berkeley. Pet mode is legit
too late! he already went cross eyed
I wish i could do this with my dog. Last time some dumbass called the cops on us even though the window was a little down and the air conditioner was on
Great cat to match a great car
Those displays are the best thing ever..
Low-key Tesla flex
Your cat has one eye in Albania and the other in Pennsylvania
I flew across Canada, I remember having to hold my panicked cat while they made sure the 2mm thick plastic case wasn't a bomb.
Those eyes!!!
My cat loves car rides too. I have to situate his crate so that he can see out the window or he whines the whole time.
So cute!
A\‚Ññ
The humane pet ignorer.
As a European, that temperature worried me.
Dream Life.
I can tell she's part Siamese by those crossed eyes. My siamese had the derpiest crossed eyes!
[deleted]
Would have been funny if OP instead put a note that read *please don't bust the window, the cats not real. I work in animal robotics. Thanks - Doug*
My dearly departed cat loved the car. We think it was because when we brought him home he got out the travel thing and ran around the car. Whenever the car door was open he'd jump in and press himself against the back window so you couldn't get him out.
My cats make a noise like they're being tortured when in a car any longer then a few seconds.
This is so adorable.
We just got a kitten and she LOVES to come along with us! She lounges on the back seat of my jeep! If there is someone in the front passenger seat she will jump up and sit in their lap! 

We ended up getting her a little harness and leash so she could come on walks as well! 

If we dont take her and take the pupper, she sits at the door and cries until we come back! Lol 

She is a little nutball!
Your cat looks like it has negative FOV
That's bigger than the telly in ma room
Our snowshoe handled a 700 mile move in November very well, little dude is [comfortable](https://i.imgur.com/4BqQJHA.jpg) just about anywhere. I read a while back they're a popular breed with truckers.
Hey not to be that person, but even if your cat is super chill it can get bored and get into places it shouldn't. It's not super safe for you, other drivers, or the cat for it to not be in a carrier. Of course it's fun to have them out of it and it *feels* more humane, but cats like small spaces and using a carrier is vet recommended.
my cat has not been in the car since the day we brought him home so i have no idea how he will take to car rides but i dread the day it comes because i have a feeling it will not go well..and for anyone wondering, we do take care of him, he is well cared for a loved and he's been to the vet lol. but not in a while, he's a happy healthy kitty :D 

also OP i love your photo!
How do you take long road trips on a Tesla? do you have to look up charging stations prior to departure? Can you autopilot 90% of it??
If I had the money, my next car would definitely be a Tesla.
Looks like pacman is about to chomp your cat.
That cat's probably used to being car sick with those bonker eyes
What an absolutely beautiful cat!
I drove with my cat from Chicago to Tennessee. We hit a lot of traffic so it ended up taking almost 12 hours to get home. He bellowed and screamed for about 8 hours of that car ride. Never again.
This is genius.
Nice /r/catloaf
My cat hated the car and would shit in it when I went into a gas station or anything when we drove back and forth to college. 

Good times mr whiskers!
Weird Tesla flex but ok
What kind of cat bed is that?
Your cat might be cooler than your Tesla. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Cat clearly didn't like the old place. Alright owner, go anywhere but here.
drove halfway across the US, our cat spent the entire time napping with his face smooshed into the A/C vent
Oh man. Drove 13 hours straight from Raleigh to Chicago with my two cats overnight in an overstuffed van. One pissed herself 30 min in, inside her kennel so we pit stopped at a rest center and tried our best to clean her and her kennel. Put her back in the kennel and covered it with a jacket cuz she would hiss non stop otherwise. Our tux cat meanwhile just calmly sat on a pillow on our lap observing the nighttime drive. He screams nonstop if he's in a kennel.
Tesla, how you like it?
Is there a child version of that tesla notification
Question - How did you handle the whole litter box thing? That‚Äôs what kept me from traveling with Mr. Meowski.
Buckle up kitty!
I got lucky and our move was only like a 10-20 minute drive. They all screamed like we were taking them to the vet. Granted that was only 3 of them at the time. I doubt the newest would have much issue with it. Still the tiny chorus of pleading was heartbreaking to me.
New unannounced Cat Mode discovered
That is an amazing feature. And I love the ode to the old Microsoft dog that you'd drag around
Typical cat not even laying in its bed
My puggle take 20mg of Prozac every day and for car rides we add doggie Dramamine.
Lol is that the condom dog? Remember that commercial with the balloon dogs going at it?
Those eyes! She loves you!!
My cat, Buddy, was like a dog that shit in a box. Loved car rides and playing fetch.
Last time i tried to set my cat free in a car ride, he went under the brake pedal. I never tried again.

&#x200B;

Ps: that's a beautiful cat you got there you lucky human being.
Must be a Tesla thing because they're quiet and smooth
How do bathroom breaks work for a cat in a car?
My kitty has a love/hate relationship with the car.
Nice car tbh.
If you call that "car" what is the thing I'm driving?
It should definitely be re-named to ‚ÄúPet Mode‚Äù. And then tailor temperatures to each animals preferences. For example, if my pet iguana is in the car, the heat should be on, not the AC.
I expect this would seriously drain your batteries.
I zoomed into your cats blue eyes and I seen the future, the past and the present all  colliding.

It has answered all the questions I have in my life, thank you and good day.
Look at that Tesla smile :P
My cat was in a travel cage in the car attached on the trailer behind the u haul.... I love you more than anything little buddy but we‚Äôre both gonna die if you don‚Äôt let me drive in peace.
Is that a Tesla?
I recently moved and had to take my 2 cats on a 3 hour plane ride, got a lot of looks from people but the card didn't scream too much
Cute cat
I'm jealous of your cat.

Took my cat to the vet once and she was crying so awfully in the carrier that I let her out. She crawled into my lap and immediately peed all over me. Like soaked me to the bone.

Never again was she allowed out of the carrier in the car.
My siamese loved the ferry, train, plane and car rides I had to take her on to take her with me from Thailand. They travel so well!
This is pure
What kind of car is that?
My cat lives in my van, wife is allergic to cats, he rides with me always and frequently rides on the dashboard, ChiliDog weighs 22 pounds, and many people freak out to see this very large cat on dash with windows open just rocking out to his internal cat track, not freaking out or trying to jump out, people just think he's stuffed until he moves and they get all animated trying to get a picture once they realize he's real, lol cats are like people they are all different!
I wanna pet em'.
Holy shit, nice car!
Nice car
Wow your cat is a beauty
Must be nice to be that wealthy
What a loaf
Nice setup!
One time I took my cat to the vet and I shit you not she took a shit
 LPT: use a Tesla when moving with your cat
Lucky. Mine hates them. Won't sit anywhere but my lap.
What? How is this possible.

I took my cat to the vet 2 miles away once. In the span of 5 minutes he had jumped on the back of my head, and pissed all over the dash.
#s‚Äôcute
You're a good servant. We all know only dogs have owners, cats have staff. Little f*ckers were worshipped as gods by the ancient Egyptians and have never forgotten it.  During our 23 hour drives from Ontario to Cape Breton one of ours would just sleep in the back window and the other kept trying to climb on my lap and drive,
Your cat is cross eyed, or is that just an accident of this photo?
