I can hear the sad trombone as he slowly slides toward the ground.
He looked so defeated as he just slowly slid down the pole.
That slow slide to the ground just a reeked of defeat.
Me, climbing the career ladder
He wasn‚Äôt sliding down in defeat, he was intentionally trying to take as much grease off as possible. A couple more attempts and that bird food is his.
Indirectly, your mom greased a squirrel too.
When that squirrel tries its best to climb to the stop, fails, and then slowly, miserably, slides to the bottom; that's how I'm going to write my autobiography.
It's little heart must be beating so hard as it attempts to get the goods. It's little heart broke all the way down.
The defeat as it slides the last little bit is the best.
My husband and I just had a good laugh at this, tell your Mum thanks.
Oh, it was your mum?

Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen this reposted a billion times.
Weird question, but why do birds get food and squirrels do not?

Philadelphia Eagles fans still found a way
Was it actually your mum or did you find this video?

Edit. It is possible his mum did it and it‚Äôs OPs own repost
Why does this make me kind of sad?
r/fatsquirrelhate
I have squirrels who eat out of my feeders all the time. I don‚Äôt mind, I just refill them more often. I think they are fun to watch.
Put peppers in the bird food. Birds aren't affected by capsaicin (the chemical that makes peppers spicy) so they won't be bothered, but mammals are so bears and squirrels will stay out.
Excellent comedic timing with that slow slide.
Its like a squirrel stripper pole
Greasing the pole is good, but eventually it‚Äôs gonna get cleaned off by squirrels or weather. 

I always thought that the [Squirrel vs the Slinky ](https://youtu.be/8QjhBKDzKcE) was also a really good way of dealing with the issue.
We put baffles on our feeder poles and it's help keep the squirrels out of the bird's food. We have a table and several ground feeders filled with peanuts and sunflower seeds just for the squirrels but they can fight or get greedy and go looking for more so we had to limit them so the birds had something. I don't think I'd ever use grease, that's too much work and just seems like a hassle to deal with.
This isn‚Äôt your video
I am the squirrel - determined me

to reach the bird food that i see

so easily the pole i climb,

but something's wrong -

i *can't* this time

as up the pole i squirm so hard,

i slide right back down to the yard

i'll try again another day...

n Karen -

*there'll be HELL to pay*....

:(
"I can't believe you've done this."

It wouldn‚Äôt stop a squirrel from Philadelphia
That squirrel has perfect comedic timing.
I keep mine on a float in the pond, no birdfood stealing, and the birds only poop in the water to boot
The saddest little squirrel slide of defeat
Squirrel: What fuckery is this?!
LET ME IN, LET ME IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN
Someone find this squirrel and get it some nuts
Omg! The poor squirrel... it‚Äôs look of defeat as it slid down is hilarious and sad at the same time üòÇ
We put a feeder up for my mom since she works from home. She uses a super soaker out the window whenever squirrels start acting up
Not into it. I‚Äôm all for keeping squirrels out of the bird seed, but I don‚Äôt want to mess with their ability to live their best squirrel lives somewhere else. 

Yes, yes, I know the grease will come off, but I feel like if climbing is your whole jam, having Surprise Butter Paws even temporarily is a pretty serious liability. The war on squirrels is real, but in the Geneva Convention in my head, this tactic is off limits.
My grandfather used to mess with the squirrels he had on his property in his old age, strictly for entertainment. My favorite of his various contraptions was a wooden dowel hung by a string in the center, so it hung horizontally. He would strap a peanut to each end with a rubber band. When the squirrels would jump from the tree onto it, it would swing around due to the fact that it was only secured at the center by the string and the squirrel would drop a few feet the ground. He used to just sit on his porch with a cannon of a[Super Soaker](https://i.imgur.com/iRpJOMb.jpg), laughing as they fell to the ground. If they made a move for the bird feeder he would blast them with the Super Soaker. He loved watching the birds in his yard and the squirrels were a menace to them.
This is a really old repost, probably a repost bot
Excellent comedic timing.
That defiant stare after his defeat. He knows what you did. Better sleep with one eye open.

That sloooow descent down hahaha!!
I have never understood why it‚Äôs ok to feed the birds but the squirrels are evil for being hungry too
I've never understood why people don't want squirrels to eat their birdseed. A) it's birdseed, isn't super expensive, and most people buy a giant ass bag of it. 2) squirrels are adorable, and they deserve food too. iii) have you ever seen a squirrel hanging upside down from your bird feeder eating the seeds? It's hilarious, and I 100% recommend!
Is this the halftime show I keep hearing about?
Keep riding the pole like that and it‚Äôs bound to get some nuts

After all the struggling. The squirrel just accepted his fate and slowly slid down the pole.
Ahhhhhh, adult life in a nutshell.
he big mad
That slide of defeat
Look at that fat fuck all disappointed he can't gank anymore free food. Get a job you lazy, entitled rodent.
I tried this once. It took the squirrels about a day to work out they could roll around in the dirt between attempts and eventually make it all the way up. If the washing line is out and there's a breeze they'll also climb up and wait for the wind to blow it round enough to be able to jump across to the bird feeder. Some have also developed a way of parkouring across my plant pots to _just_ get enough spring to make it up - they fail half the time, but they jump in such a way that if they fall short they can push off and land in a bush to cushion their fall. Clever bastards.

It doesnt even matter

A slinky will work as well.
I did the same.  Squirrels were going through bird feed like crazy until I greased the pole.
I nailed a board to a tree with nails sticking out where I stuck corn cobs onto so the squirrels could eat.
Not gonna lie I thought this was gonna be the video/picture with the squirrel nuts stuck
That look at the end is the same look I have after I find out the restaurant I planned to eat at isn‚Äôt open
Use a metal slinky.
We have problems with squirrels on our feeders too. We hang them over the fence because the birds fling the seeds and we have a stone yard, but the squirrels will climb up the hooks and hang upside down from the feeders. They're dumb as hell, but they're persistent.
Mysterious as the dark side of the moooooon
Suddenly I feel like throwing it a five dollar bill
"Fuck this, I'll be a stripper."
I did this to my feeders a few years ago. We had at least 20 squirrels that called my backyard home. They were so frustrated with the crisco poles, they started flinging themselves off the trees, trying to land on the feeders. They would literally try this for hours....
Looks like that video of the pole dancer who fell 15 feet

At the end he's like, "YOU THINK THIS SHIT IS FUNNY?!"
This might be a dumb question and I'm sure my father answered it years ago when he was filling ours, but what is it about feeding the birds that is preferable to feeding the squirrels? A lot of effort goes into keeping the latter out.
Wonder what this looks like reversed...

I've done this.  The Squirrels will come back every few minutes and try again.  They will get all the oil off it about two hours and be right back at it.

I've also seen them just dive off the roof to the feeder.

Wasn't even mad.   I admire the tenacity.
My dad did the same thing, and some of the squirrels started leaping off of the nearby tree trying to land on the feeder. Took a few tries sometimes, but they got to it. It was wild watching them try different things to get to it.

My dad did this years ago before he got a new pole. They make certain bird feeder poles for this! It has a cylinder type thing in the middle of the pole that has a closed off top so that they can‚Äôt get to the feeder. However, greasing the pole is much more entertaining. Crisco works best!

This is actually an interesting glimpse into animal psychology. 

At first when the squirrel sees the prize he runs up the pole with all of his energy and enthusiasm to get the nut. Even when the path gets difficult he keeps up his intensity because he can maybe break through. When he realizes, however, that it is too difficult, he just gives up. This is what scientists call "learned helplessness" and corresponds with depression in humans. When you think there is no link between your efforts and success, you give up.
Maybe next time steal a video that hasn't been around the internet like twice, this vids so old just give it up
Cute little thing. Looked so dang defeated with the slow slide down. Definitely the story of my life. 

Obligingly PSA. Only since I didn‚Äôt see it in the top few comments. But it‚Äôs important to note that this is not a good solution. The grease can get the squirrel (Or other animals) sick if it accidentally ingests any. And it can make their fur clump up which leaves them vulnerable to the elements. (Generally it doesn‚Äôt wash off easy) It can make bird feathers clump up as well which needless to say would be very bad for them.
LPT: This can be dangerous for birds and squirrels alike. 

"Adding grease or oil to a pole or hanger to make it too slippery for squirrels to climb is not only largely ineffective, but it can coat the animals' fur as well as birds' feathers. This can cause illness and vulnerability to predators just as much as an oil spill or any similar contamination."
I am sick of all the birds stealing the squirrel food.
I can‚Äôt believe I almost skipped over this thinking it was another repost of the same old squirrel and greased pole vid. This is BEAUTIFUL!! I will be watching this and lmao for the next two weeks!! I might even be cured of my internet cancer just from watching this ridiculous rodent!

Wonder now if that stripper pole was greased?
Pole dancing squirrels was not how I expected this day to end
This is the height of comedy.
Eventually his fur will wipe off all the oil and he'll get up there!
I invested in one of those squirrel proof feeders where it drops down when they jump down on it.  It works really well.
I give him an A for effort. He really went for it there
All the way down the pole he's thinking, What's my next move?  Dirt and leaves on my feet to wipe off the grease?  Ladder?  Launch self from nearby tree?  Think, Buddy, think!!

At least that's what I imagine based on years of being outsmarted by squirrels.

Y'all need some philly squirrels.

Hustlers (dir. Lorene Scafaria, 2019)
Dancing for dem seeds
Fire fighter Squirrel reporting for duty
My grandparents used to do this
The last part looked almost cartoonish.
My money is on the squirrel figuring out another way to get the seeds.
"I'm frustrated and covered in grease! What is this, puberty?"

from when =3 showcased this video.
The ol philidelphia super bowl win trick. People tried to get up those street posts for days.
I see some people think the squirrel lost. That squirrel is now greased up as planned. Ahh yeah.
My mom's the opposite, shoos birds away so they don't steal the squirrels treats. Interesting
Working to pay off that tuition one dance at a time.
watch squirrels die inside
"Uh...I've got a sinking feeling." - Squirrel, on the long slide down.
I've done the same! Hysterical!
the slow defeated slide back down
\*Visual representation of my life falling apart\*
Me accepting that my life is going downhill
Oh, look! A new ride! Now she'll have to keep it greased just to keep them entertained.
This looks like squirrel pole-dancing.
*Stares at camera*

‚ÄúYou think this is funny?‚Äù
In his head he was like ‚Äúbut this has never happened before...‚Äù
He likes it.
Going down?
Soon you will have a massive amount of squirrel dollar bills.
I say combine this slider with that squirrel projectile contraption--a real live comedy outside your window.
This needs a really somber tune added in.
That long, slow slide down the pole while looking directly at the camera!
All aboard the sadness ride
I'm waiting for a video from a night club.
TIL I'm that squirrel
My guy actually got pretty high on that greasy pole before his slow slide down.
/r/Watchsquirrelsdieinside
My life in a nutshell
That's actually brilliant.  Eventually, he'll wipe all the grease off, and then it's feeding time!
The look as he slid down the pole in defeat. Really captures how I feel about life.
Tried this once many years ago before my father built an excellent baffle.  Our determined squirrels just kept trying over and over until they finally got traction.
Squirrel: gonnagetsomefood! Gonnagetsomeffff-whatthefuck! Whatthefuck!
This needs to be in /r/WatchPeopleDieInside
Serious Okay serious question here. Can't you just put seed at the bottom for the squirrels or will they still try to climb the pole?
That slow slide of acceptance

Squirell: bruh
 [u/vredditdownloader](https://www.reddit.com/u/vredditdownloader/)
somebody come get her she dancing like a stripper\~ ‚ô™
He‚Äôs a lil firefighter
Can we get a salute for that squirrel
The slide of shame
One heck of a half time show
Yeaaa girl you want deez nuts you work the pole. Yeah do it sexy like.
üé∂Somebody come get er she dancin like a stripper üé∂
Poor guy was defeated!!! Hilarious!
u/vredditdownloader
TIL that no one gives a crap about a good 'fed up' pun when there's a squirrel slowly sliding down a pole.
Climbing the greasy pole. Literally.
It is extremely rare that I actually laugh at anything on the internet anymore.  But, somehow, that slow slide of defeat had me just laughing and laughing.  Thanks for that.
Oh yeah!
I know it doesn‚Äôt completely apply but r/watchpeopledieinside
This needs some old school cartoon sound effects.
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôve done this‚Äù
That squirrel is an Eagles fan
That's some Ice Age level s\*it you got going on there.
I think that squirrel had an existential crisis when it reached the bottom of the pole
ü§£ lmao! I like how at the end he's just like "...... I hate you.... I know you did this."
Some pretty hot pole action I'd say
Hope the grease is nothing dangerous. I know squirrels are a pain in this way, though. My parents employed a cone that the squirrels can't seem to get around.
What did she grease the pole with?
Another day of working the pole.

r/WatchPeopleDieInside \- only its a squirrel.  You can feel the defeat.
He was almost there !
Book that squirrel for the next Super Bowl halftime show, he's great at pole dancing.

I....i....what is this sorcery i climbed this thing like yesterday
I would like to mention this is the first time I've seen a vertical video that worked out well.
Dude, try sprinkling some chilli powder/flakes/sauce on the bird food. It doesnt effect the birds whatsoever. Squirrels will have a sniff and walk away. Hope it helps!
Needs some J-Lo music in the background.
Cue in Eye of the Tiger
So hot.
I don‚Äôt know why I flashed to Miley Cyrus. Wrecking ball video.
r/aww ? This is r/funny as fuck
This is a metaphor for my life.
Why should birds be favored over squirrels tho.

"Of course, you know this means war!"
Here I am, hiding in the bathroom at work, bulging my eyes out trying not to guffaw out loud because of you.

A squirrel baffle made out of stainless steel works extremely well also
goonature a18 will take car of all those problems for you (:
He‚Äôs like a fireman!
Jennifer Lopez who
This is it, Morty. You dont fuck with squirrels.
Well. Shit
Wheeeee
I thought this was gonna be the video fo that squirrel stuck to a pole like this by its nuts. I braced to cringe.
r/watchinganimalsdieinside
Stripper squirrel
u/vredditdownloader so cute
TIL cartoons are based on real life.
The grease gets stuck in their fur and causes them to die from the cold, don't grease your poles.
5 rewatches.

I'm still laughing.
Does anyone have a squirrel dollar?
It looks so defeated as it slowly slides down
My grandparents gave up and actually now just feed the squirrels. They hung some chains that you can screw corn cobs on and they jump on them and swing. So they play and get a snack.
I distinctly heard a "FUCK!" when he jumped off the bottom
Just put a slinky around the pole

It's gotta pay for college somehow.
My Retirement Grease!!! MAKE WAY FOR WILLY
This is... from the movie ice age
/r/animaltextgifs get to work
Honestly he got up a lot further than I expected
Damn you, humans!
Happy cake day, Schnoodle!
What viscosity of varmint grease is that?

This squirrel is like: I'm disgrace to my Clan
/u/vredditshare
Poor guy
Slide of shame
Contemplating life choices on the slow pole slide of shame...ditto mr. squirrel
the slide of defeat
I hope someone puts some audio to this.  As he is sliding down, I can imagine him saying... What The Fuuuuuuuuucckkk!!!
I'm so sad for this squirrel üòî
