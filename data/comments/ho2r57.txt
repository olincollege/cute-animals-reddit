"Moon Moon, where are you?"



"Roof!"
Aww man who invited moon moon
What they doin up der
Definitely a husky thing.
What is it with huskys and getting on the roof? My husky as kid would always climb onto the roof from the backyard and chill.
How did they get up there?
Moon moon......... havent heard that name in years
Omg i forgot about moon moon!
You‚Äôve heard of elf on the shelf? Well, here‚Äôs floof on the roof
Dammit moon moon

moon2M Hey chat.
I am legally obligated to say, ohh, big stretch!
God damn it Moon Moon
Idk what it is about huskies and plopping their bodies down like their made of lead lmao my husky does the same!
I never knew i needed to see a doggos flooof from under glass.
Love the little paw tuck. 11/10 fur smoosh
That‚Äôs a nice skylight. It‚Äôd be a shame if someone put their anus on it!
Aww I love the little head plop at the end ü•∞
Snoopy did it first
Meme throwback
No one's gonna mention that the other (dog?) looks like a white fox
Paint some runes on there and you've got moon-moon-moonrunes
If they poop....you‚Äôll see it!
The god gamer
I love how he looks so intense for a few seconds then smile like another doggo
‚ÄúWhat a good stretch. Such a good doggo‚Äù -every dog parent
M O O N, that spells husky
Oh so THAT‚ÄôS what updog is. Hi updog 14/10
PLEASE READ THIS IF THIS TEMPTS YOU TO GO ON A SKYLIGHT.

My older brother died at the age of 12 because he went and sat on a skylight at a park community centre.

These aren't built for supporting weight. Please, please if you are thinking about it or if you know anyone that might possibly do the same, I urge you to prevent it.
Goddammit Moon Moon
Yelled ‚ÄúOH BIG STRETCH‚Äù while watching this and my dog looked so confused
Haha I like the big stretch before just flopping down on the window üòÇ
I have a fetish for dog paws
How tf did the dog get on the roof?
Y r their dogs on the roof
This is the shit you click Save on.

*FLOP*
hahah this seems so fun for themmm
That doesn‚Äôt look all that safe.
How do I get doggies on my roof!
Okay cool we know how Grey got on the roof but why are these dogs on the roof? What's the layout? Is there a whole yard on the roof or something? I need to see this house.
They mostly come out at night. Mostly.
"Honey.... dogs are on the roof again"
How the fuck does something like this happen
That camera work is making me nauseous. Why did this become a thing.
Welp, this is an absolute must now when I‚Äôm home hunting.
it's all fun and games until he starts pooping
That has to be the ultimate power move.
house looking wild tho
Visible confusion
Window cleaning at it‚Äôs finest
Belly!!
Reminds me of my cats on my bungalow roof wondows.
Breaking News: Fluffy Biscuit turns into Pancake
Awe, I love the way he stretches. My dog is a husky mix and does the exact same stretch.
All fun and games until someone takes a dump...
It poops and pees on the light heheheh
What kind of bird is that?
Perfect, now we can see the beans with crystal clear clarity!
ass on the glass
Weird birds you got there up yer roof.
I'm having a mixed moment of cuteness overload and extreme anxiety over the strength of that glass
I have several questions.
I met god. He was a good boi.
I don't know what it is with being human and seeing dogs that makes my brain lit up and fill with chemical happiness.
You‚Äôve pulled quite the deep cut with the moon moon reference. I had forgotten all about that one and appreciated the reminder and chuckle.
We have found updog
This made me smile, thank you, i needed that

It's all cute and adorable until the glass breaks with the dog on it
Butthole.
Doggo go squish

Melting Doggo
Oh my god that happy smile then that cute stretch!

Moon Moon? I haven't heard that name in years
I like how he looks down to check if he's got an audience then he's like "alright time to stretch and plop down"
Doge said skwish
I love how he just accepts that there's this invisible floor that he can walk / lie down on without falling into the room below.
God tier title Op
One question: how did they get up there?
How did they get up there

r/confusingperspective
The wild and rare roof husker!!!
Why are they on the roof?

How did they even get up there
Lul
There is no husky. They're only TV.

Only room is real.
I'm so envy and happy for you
Lol it looks so pleased with itself. üòÇ
Do you guys know how much weight that skylight can hold?
He did the stretchies
At the day you can see his balls lmao
Omg that stretch is the cutest! Little floofstars
Wish I has a dog on my roof!
I like when his belly touches the glass
Just walking in and seeing a dog shadow on the floor would be confusing as heck
Pupskirt
I see the moon,
Moon moon sees me,
Moon moon watches me as I get sleepy,
If I lie awake I do not count sheep,
I count Moon moons till I go to sleep
Hot boi.
I never knew how much I needed to see a dog on glass.

I forgot about moon moon until now. So glad I found if again.
That‚Äôs it. I also need a roof dog.
Tell me where this is, and how I can experience it
Oh wow, this takes me back. I remember when Moon Moon was a new meme. I think I saw it on Tickld before that site became hot garbage.
bury the fence deep as well so they don‚Äôt dig/tunnel underneath
they are a lot less intimating from down here
Oh my god, I completely forgot about the dumbass moon moon meme
But never dogs on the moon. They aren‚Äôt allowed, y‚Äôknow why?
This video makes me irrationally happy üòäüòäüòä
Sploot.

Sigh, then who‚Äôll feed and scritch us?
*proceeds to shit on the Glass*
Leg squish
I love them so much , I would die for them.
We use to have a coffee table with a thick glass top that my dog loves to sleep on (he‚Äôs a very small poodle) and I loved as a kid getting under the table and seeing him lay like this
Never seen this type of bird before...

I haven't heard that name in a looong while.
At first before clicking I thought it was a picture stuck to a fridge door.

Don‚Äôt ask me why, is what I saw.
The constant zooming did to my eyes what interrupters do to your sentence.
Damn it MoonMoon
Moon moon or Roach?
Classic Moon Moon
Dammit Moon Moon!!
I‚Äôd ask how they got on the roof but I also have a husky
‚ÄúMoon moon, sit‚Äù

And now you can see Uranus.
Looks like one of those wildcat enclosures you can walk under, only a little huskier
I'm still confused
Love the head plop
How did he get on the roof
Ohh big stretch.
Are they on the roof or are we in a basement?!

Omg this is so cute. I‚Äôve never seen a dog just plop like that
Why is this post not exploding? I think it's amazing.
This looks very dangerous or at least a good way to scratch your sunroof. Edit: downvote all you want. People have died from this plenty of times.
