Man she‚Äôs shrinking fast in another 5 years she‚Äôll completely disappear
Wut.

Ma‚Äôam, what are you feeding your gerbil
Faelen is a wolfdog, selectively bred for many generations to look like a wolf, yet be better adapted for life alongside humans. Faelen is being raised as a companion animal primarily, but also works as an ambassador for other Wolfdogs and wolves.
Susan that's a wolf
Came preinstalled with adult paws and ears.

Which member of the Stark house are you?
Lol at the leash. Like your ass is stopping that animal from doing anything it wants to.
[deleted]
The dog is Faelen the Wolfdog and can be found on Instagram. His owner's actual insta account is **runningwithwolfdogs** and there's a lot of info there.
What is going on with the perspective here? Why is this woman has a tiny head, a giant palm and enormous twisted legs that look like they belong to a different person?
r/wolvesarebigyo
That's some Big Bad Wolf right there!
That lady is so lucky, probably the first human to ever get shrunk

2021 is wild man
Wolf hybrid? Im not good at dog breeds.
Damn the lady got way smaller in 2 years
Fenrir is that you
Can we stop with the forced pawspective posts....
Wow, that lady shrunk loads in 2 years.
The wolf is the same size. She just shrunk.
That's some forced perspective considering how big her foot looks compared to her head
Sorry to disappoint, but the 2nd photo utilizes foreshortening tricks. Compare the size of her giant boot to her head and you will see that she is sitting back several feet away to look smaller.
Isn't there an issue with folks getting these guys, realizing they can't handle them,and then abandoning them? That's what I remember from talking to one of the profs at my school way back then who'd adopted four or five, all rescue cases.
What do you mean I can‚Äôt take my emotional support animal into wallmart?
Wolf?
Himb wolf
Wow you're a quarter of the size you used to be!
Is that a wild animal?
Wow,  she shrank a lot.
...wow, that lady sure shrank a lot!


...beautiful animal there
Wow she really shrunk!
The human has grown smaller
OMG that is scary as hell, not the dog, I mean what the fuck happened to her leg! Jesus.
Another episode of small person or big dog?
More like awwwtf
She shrunk!
Camera angles are really tricky
Damn, she got small over the years
Isn‚Äôt this dog breed illegal wtf
Forced perspective. Look at her left foot on the right pic.
Wow, that woman really shrunk a lot in 2.5 years
You managed to turn a normal lady into a dwarf version of herself In just two years!?
Some weird forced perspective going on here. Look at the size of her head in comparison to her hand and feet.
These photos bother me. 

In every single one it's the owner clearly sitting a little way behind the animal in the second picture, using perspective to exagerrate the size. 

If she stood up next to it  that would look like a fairly large dog, but nothing exceptional.
Something's off in the picture on the right.
Omg real wolf
Interesting what you can do with a wide angle lens your foot is 5x bigger than your head.
I almost got a wolf hybrid. Until I read that sometimes the wolf portion can shine through and the day you come home from work with a limp, they may try to take you out to become pack leader. 

I got a pit instead. Lol. Best dog I‚Äôve ever had.
Hmm, that's not a dog pup you got there üòÑ
what breed is he/she?
(totally asking for a friend and for my addiction on big dogs)
The wolf if big, but the wide angle lens makes him look bigger.
Such a beauty
The big baby paws oh my god
Omg hes soooo fluffy hes soooo cuuuuuttteee
Beautiful animal üòç
We truly don't deserve the intrinsic loyalty of dogs.
Venturing back to Little Red Riding Hood.

What if Little Red Riding Hood was the evil granddaughter this whole time and the Big Bad Wolf wanting to protect grandma, took her place in bed so she could go hide.

It was only bad luck that the Huntsman misjudged the situation.

I like your bear.
It's beautiful, but my grandma is missing.
Ma‚Äôam that‚Äôs a wolf
A beautiful dog but the perspective of the 2 photos is designed to mislead you into thinking he is a giant dog. From the size of his foot referenced to the size of his owners foot he is about the same size (possibly) slightly smaller than our poodle. I can't find an actual weight for him online although he has lots of social media feeds. I would love to know how large he actually is if anyone has more info.
The second picture has some seriously bad photoshopping effect. The woman‚Äôs foot looks like a giants and her hand is bigger than her entire head.
Beautiful. And I wouldn't mess with that lady.
dire wolf
Bruh
How does one acquire a direwolf?
I just hate trying to tie up those 35 gallon poop bags (lol)!!!

Big dawg, does he fetch?
They grow up so fast.

Have you more pictures about him when he grows up.
Having such a pet is a treasure
This is a wolf right?
Is it a wolf ?
I've never seen a disease causing such drastic height loss
What breed is it
im pretty sure that isnt a dog, you got yourself a wolf.
I can‚Äôt believe how much that poor lady shrank
What I like is how much her hand grew in 2.5 years.
If you threaten her I will end you stare.
What kind of sheep is that?
Must be some shopping bill feeding that wolf-dog!
Watched Thor Ragnarok last night, it appears you're looking to conquer the planet with that doggo
is it a wolf-dog?
Winter is coming
Lady just get herself her own Legoshi.
I'm gonna need more pictures plz
You've shrunk! Seriously though what a magnificent looking beastie.
It's a creep.

Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs
Why has her left hand gone from being teeny-weeny to mahoosive?
Holy hell!! 

If that thing ever gets loose and wanders the neighborhood, someone is calling the Winchester brothers.
Is that a wolf dog?
Soo beautiful!
Beautiful!!
You look so happy
BIG PUPPERS
Is it a wolf?
Is this a wolf or a dog? Please tell me someone!!
Keep Wolfie fed and hand over the keys when Wolfie asks.
Reminded me of Mightyena from the Hoenn region.
What kind of dire wolf is that
And the wolf kept feeding on her....
Well her hair got a bit more grey.. other than that she appears happy
Where can I buy a dog like this?
 That big puppy, especially maybe when he grows up, it's even bigger than me
Everyone gets a wolf but me these days...
Is it a wolf? üê∫
Today everyone learned that wolves are MUCH bigger than dogs.

r/wolvesarebigyo
Is that and actual wolf or just a specific dog breed? If it's a dog pls say the breed, I need to get one of those beautiful animals
wow
In first photo her hand is like 1/3 rd the size of her head.  In the second her hand is almost larger than her head.
Did he grow or you just shrunken?
Better practice taping broken miniature liquor bottles on to your knuckles for the inevitable dominance challenge in a year or two. [r/Aww my ass](https://youtu.be/UvZTPfPMYNA)
How did she shrink so fast..??!!
i ded
From cute to ‚Äúimma eat you‚Äù
Um... whats going on with her legs?
I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have to pick up after him. He must put down some pretty big cookies.
You might want to get your left foot checked out. I don‚Äôt think at your age it should be growing that much.
What happened to you??
Ngl this is more AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA than aww
The woman hasnt grown that much
She definitely goes through shit-tons of peanut butter.
Grew in to those ears well!
woah
Is that not a fkn wolf or what
Dire Wolf?  He's huge!!!
When they say "I like big dogs" and you expect like a mastiff but open the door and there's a FUCKING WOLFDOG, I would never leave I'd just play with him all day until I die
What a beautiful creature
Aww I love wolves.
Looks like Sirius Black.
Wow it's so beautiful
baby man
Wolverine is that you?
You preparing for battle??
What brand of wolf is that
I literally went awwwwwwoooooahhhh
I always forget how large those critters can get... theres always this irrational part of my brain that hopes that the people who pose with wolves are super small people. That this lady is only 3ft tall and her husky is all black... lol  XD
How many people has he eaten?
Ain't nobody stealing grandmas cookies with that guard dog!
That‚Äôs a big German shepherd!
How much do wolf dogs go for $$? And are they calm and nice like dogs?

She‚Äôs raising Sirius Black

That's a big shoe right there.
Looks like the woman aged 40 years
Id like to see the video of her galloping on the wolf brandishing some arcane blade towards the enemy
wow incredible, what a creature! my cats are turning one and I spent the past hours looking through baby fotos, time is flying.
Look at the size of those paws!
I‚Äôm curious to how much it eats and WHAT?
I‚Äôve never seen a person shrink so much in only 2 years!
Is that a wolf?
Nice racoon but ive seen bigger
Yup, that‚Äôs a wolf.
Holy direwolf. I‚Äôll bet he eats a lot
That is amazing :)
Hella wants her dog back.
My aunt and uncle on my mom's side had a wolf dog of some sort. It was such a beautiful creature.

What Pok√©mon is that?
Wolf?
absolutelly gorgeous <3 <3 <3
What breed is this?
Dire wolves are real?!
That's a big dog. But, her hand and foot seem to be way bigger than the first photo. Either she has a weird form of gigantism or it's a slightly forced perspective photo. No matter though, he's a beautiful animal anyway.
Did the dog get bigger or you got smaller?
he looks like a half wolf/dog mix ....
Wolf?
The handler looks like she got younger
Fenrir at home:
Imagine riding that wolf like Princess Mononoke...
The eyes say "wolf" and the muzzle says "also wolf."
Awww it‚Äôs a bbc

He grew into his ears!

So cute!!!
You have also miniaturised yourself using some exotic technology... There's no other way.
Ok, scary AF and beautiful all at the same time.
Is this perspective or did you adopt Fenrir?
Has the mailman been given adequate waring that he's about to meet his maker? üòÇ

Stunning!!
Also amazing how this lady has a foot twice the size of her head.  No perspective issues at all.
Beautimous.
Look at how big that fluffy bois paws were as a young pup!
Wow this is an incredibly beautiful and elegant beast!
Damn, she became small..

So you shrank?
American Alsatian? Bred to mimic the dire wolf.

Absolutely beautiful! I bet he or she loves you very much
Irish wolfhound?
aww, cute
Wolf. That's a wolf. And I love it.
That's some trippy perspective on the second picture
The forced perspective makes the dog look bigger than it is.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry he doesn‚Äôt bite‚Äù 

**the dog**
oh my god i just realized how big this dog is, how many 5 layer burritos are you feeding that hog of a dog
this warms my heart
Hardly changed at all, still wearing jeans .
you drove him there, now he will take you back home with the car
What is the breed?
Goes from am smol to IF YOU GET CLOSE TO HUMAN U DIE!
This is some Peter Jackson level perspective shenanigans. Look at the size of her foot compared to the dog. She is sitting/leaning on a rock further back in the frame than the dog. 

This is still a big dog (wolf???)
Am I the only one afraid of how big it‚Äôs shits are.
\#oooooooooooooooooooooo
Is that a fucking wolf?
Are .. are her legs ... on backwards??
At first you got to pet the dog, but now the dog pets you
Is that wolf?? He is stunning!
Not a pet.

BiG doggie! What breed is it?
Beautiful
She's beautiful!
Dats a big pupper. Do they like Belly Rubs?
Man that wolf looks mean.

r/wolvesarebigyo
You can always tell how big they‚Äôll be by the size of their paws!
And my first thought was still: Baby!!! Big dark scary fluffy baby! Yes, I am aware I would get eaten alive in the wild, no need to tell me.
I remember that mafk from Thor: Ragnarok
 beautiful ....wolf?. very impressive
Dang how long did that take between pictures
Has it eaten another dog yet?
Do you have to steal one of these out of a cave or?
Certainly grew into them ears.
Is that a wolf?!

Das a Woolf bro
Thats not a dog...thats a wolf
Direwolf!
That‚Äôs a big ass German Shepherd
You've shrunk a lot in 2 years, I'd see a doctor.

That‚Äôs a literal fucning wolf
This poor woman has shrunk quite a bit in that time. Hope she is doing well üôè
So basically Awwwww to awwwwww shit
Uh, guys, why is Fenrir unchained?
You shrunk lady!
I'm trying to understand the feet placement
This is fenris wolf
Terrible job. Either the woman's body shrunk to half size or her feet and legs doubled and twisted.
What kind of breed is that?
r/wolvesarebigyo ?
Honestly, if that dog was walking next to her and it didn't have a collar around it, I'd clear the area post haste.
Is that even a dog?
That's a beautiful wolf!
Black sadaharu.
For the Horde?!
A Wolf?
I want your life
WOW
The women got smaller?
May I ask what type of dog/wolf dog that is? No offense I wanna try to get one.
Beautiful!!
Majestic af.
If she ever stops feeding that thing, she's dead.
I think I know where the 3 lil pigs are.
What in the House of Stark is this??
what kinda dog is this? or is it a wolf?
That's not a dog...
Photoshopped she has a bigger shoe then shaq
She told me about a family who brought a rottweiler puppy and brought it in for the first vaccines. My friends were a vet nurse. It's coming and it's a fucking guinea pig.
Look how big her hand is relative to her head. It‚Äôs a misleading perspective.
I want one so it will attack my enemies .
Holy shit she‚Äôs huge!
Nice Marmot
The Starks would like their Dire Wolf back.
Holy shit
big doggo
That's Wolf
He went from awww to awwwshit!!
Can you imagine leading that guy into the vet's office, lol!
Thiccccccccc
What kind of horse is that?/s
Proof positive women shrink with age. : )
Would you send a knight out on a dog like this?
Lol, thats so photoshopped its not even funny.  
  
Lol.
I would have name her/him Fenrir. Pure beauty.
What kind of dog? I need one
Damn, what a beast
Dats a big ol boi
Damn, I wouldve thought it was a German Shepherd puppy, not a Wolf.

I'm going to be side-eyeing any German Shepherd puppies I see now.

Oh gosh... I want to ask if this is a dire wolf üòÖ but this is such a beautiful creature!!
Omg that's Jellybean!
I remember the first time I saw a real wolf in person. They are so much bigger than almost any dog I‚Äôve ever seen, and I‚Äôve owned English mastiffs before. And yet they moved around in a way that seemed like they weighed less than a feather. Absolutely amazing creatures
Now that's a big doggo!
That is a beautiful animal. And so big!
I may be wrong, but someone should tell that nice old lady she adopted Gmork.

I worked in a strip mall/retail store and walk in after lunch and I thought there was a bear in the store. It was as one of these. Probably the only time I actually feared sharing space with a dog.
