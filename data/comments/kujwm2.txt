How does he feel, being her idol and center of the universe? 🥰
One of my co-workers always brings his dog with him to work, she's a sweet rescue from Greece. She dislikes some of my other co-workers and tolerates the others but for some reason I'm the chosen one. She always comes to sit with me and asks me to pet her. She will often completely ignore her owner and focus entirely on me lol.
Awww those sweet eyes! 💕💕
Your husband has a new wife now
[deleted]
I volunteer at an animal shelter and it’s astonishing how many people come in looking for a puppy or worried about adopting at all because they think a rescue dog won’t be able to bond as much as one they “raised”. No one will love you as much as a rescue dog. They know you saved them and they will show you endless gratitude and love for it.
r/dogsmirin....thats sweet as hell.
In fairness, I’m pretty sure he’s looking at the dog the same way ;)
r/disneyeyes
 very nice
r/DogsMirin
Scrach me like one of your french dogs lmao
I think someone has stolen your husband...
This made my day. Thank you for being such a great person.
Our husband*
Such a sweet pup! Do you know the breed? (S)he looks strikingly similar to my pup.
Your pup is a disney princess
You’re outta there. Your half of the bed is no longer “yours”. It’s time to look for a comfy sleeper couch.
Our husband
OMG! They are in love!!  It just warms my heart to see your dog's face.
The look of love 🎵
okay i might be wrong, but whenever my dog gave me the eyes when theres white showing, if i kept petting him he’d bite me
Soulmates 🥰 

Move over. 😄
This is the most endearing thing I’ve ever seen. You can see the love shining through the dog’s eyes.
Puppy love
Geez I hope a human looks at me that way one day
I like how you say "my husband" haha... as if...
Our?  Nah she’s his.
Recused my first pup this summer.

&#x200B;

I get those same eyes, it's the best. :)
Sorry, he's not your husband anymore. /s
This is so sweet. Pup looks so happy!! Thank you for being good parents!
That’s her husband now.
The love in those eyes for their human.
Bet you look at him just like that.
Love, that’s definitely love❤️
My dog gets jealous if I touch my wife. 

To the point of giving me the grumpy, derp face and the cold shoulder.
Girl rescue dogs are the funniest creatures on gods green earth and when it comes to men that love them. Mine who is now 7 years old looks at me and my dad like we are Jesus and God every morning. 6:00am hello my savory lol.
I love gingers too!
wow rescue? from a burning house or something?
I don't know you at all, but, I think you're the third wheel in this relationship...
I think you’re replaced.
So adorable 🥰
So precious 😍😍
Needed this today.  Thanks!
You've got some serious competition!
I want someone to look at me the way that dog looks at your husband!!!
Scooby Doo and Scooby Dad
Your Puppy is Trusting & Loving 🥰 your husband & your Husband is in love with your new Puppy
How your husband is looking at the puppy
Our husband**
Now you are the third wheel and you have accepted it. You secretly love being the third wheel
No one has ever looked at me like that . . . Not even my own dogs. And I know they loved me.
*our husband.
That is true love right there. No way to deny it. It doesn’t matter what species you are, that look is the universal sign of love.
She looks like "I'll love you forever"
<we've reached maximum puppy dog eye levels>
Daddy’s girl
So this is what true love looks like!! Beautiful
I’d start sleeping with one eye 👁open. With the dog looking at my husband this way. SO ADORABLE!!!
what an angel!
Off topic, but your under-the-stair shelving is cool!
u/savevideo
That BITCH!
The way your husband looks at the rescue dog.
❤️🐾❤️🐾
Looks like it’s *our husband now.
'Mirin
OH MY GODDDD🥺🥺
Aww so cute I want one!
Your pup just found a way cuter face than the puppy-eyes stare  
*Upside-down puppy eyes*
The puppy: *our husband*
This is called whale eyes and generally means the dog is very anxious/afraid. It's a warning sign and often precedes defensive bites.
Based on your husbands beard game.. id look at him like that too :P
And then there's my rescue cat that looks at me like I'm bothering him by my continuing existence in his house..
Username doesn't check out
that's the look of "14344"..😘
that is so pretty
dogs are awesome
How cute!

This also belongs on r/mirin
Nawwwwww
Lovestruck And falling for a lampost
Awww
Awww, what a precious baby!
Miss steal your man , with those eyes.
Adorable!
r/disneyeyes
Yeah I'm jealous too.
Just got a rescue kitty can confirm also looks at me like this
I think OP has a competitor now.
Oof. You might have competition for a sleeping partner. That’s love.
We should have to pay the rescues for these babies.🥰🥰🥰
Life goals?
Ginger And Community!
Don't be jealous..😁
r/DogsMirin
His face literally looks like the dog from Up!
And they even got the same hair/fur colour.... Sweetie!
literally has the 🥺look
I think it’s reciprocated, looking at your husbands face.
Awww daddy’s girl
Mans best friend for a reason.
That looks like the main guy from predator poachers YouTube channel
I wish my wife looked at me that way
Hate to break the news, he is no longer your man lol
Those eyes give me Precious Moments vibes.
You are blessed
This needs to be in r/DisneyEyes ❤️
They look so in love with each other it makes me smile
Does he skritch you like that? Do you look at him the same way?
/r/Mirin
Awwww looks like a Disney carton character sooo cute 🥰
Probably how I’d be looking at your husband as well.
oh myyyy now that is love
She loves him so much omg
Cute
Welp, we all know who is the side bitch now. /s
I want a girl to look at me the way this rescue dog looks at its owner.
Now that’s a dog that knows how to get itself adopted
Omg the dog’s eyes remind me of the Precious Moments figurines
True love
I loveses you.
Plastic wrap around your head, tie it into a bandana style, and put a quarter sized amount of peanut butter on it, keep a small bowl of peanut butter to replenish bandana, cut dogs nails while they lick bandana, depending on strength of your dogs tongue, you might want to make sure that shits decently tight. :)
This is r/mirin material for sure.
Treasure it. My rescue cat looked at me the same way. We lost her 3 days ago and I feel so empty without her by my side.
Is your husband Dale Earnhardt Jr.?
That is unreal!
What a sweet puppy!
Could we get more of your husband?
This dog is so cute
Awww! You have a lovely husband and dog! You are winning at life OP. Enjoy!
I’m excited to see more pics of this pup please thank you.
This makes my heart happy. Why do I want to cry?
The best posts on here are the ones where you involuntarily go "awwwh"
what kind of puppy is that?
Omg so cute
Omg the cutest thing!
Omg my heart ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😳🥰
r/mirin
That is absolute adoration.  So fantastic
I want someone to look at me that way!
You might have the best husband, not just the best rescue girl.
Someone's in love. Lol
Careful there, she wants your spot! LOL
🥰🥰🥰🥰😘😘😘 aww puppy
Your husband is looking at the pup the same way - I think the feeling is mutual
I mean with that beard how can you not???
"I love you dearly. Thank you for not kicking me. Please don't kick me."
Oh buddy. So cute.
Her loves her Daddy. Animal parents unite!!!
Now that is what I call puppy eyes.
OP I demand a longer video! This adorable look isn't worth only 3 seconds. I demand more
The way they hold the eye contact tho 🥺🥺
The pup looks at owners as if to say, thank you so much for rescuing me; I am indebted to you. I feel so great you rescued me; I am yours always.
What exactly is a "rescue pup"?   
(This is adorable btw)
You mean “how our rescue pup looks at our husband.” lol!
She gonna steal your man
Mans really went 🙄
What bredd of dog is it?
"Oh, you big one with hair on your face, you're HANDSOME, and I LOVE YOU!!!"
I mean, if someone rub my back that kindly, I'd look at him like that, too..
Cute
Oh dang... they’re both really cute lol.
awww 😊🥺
I think she likes him
Our rescue does the same thing. These are the best doggos to get. So loving.
Okay, first off that puppy is the cuitest thing i have ever seen, I am happy for both of you!
Everyone, get you someone who looks at you like this dog looks at op's husband
has been one of my biggest dreams for years, to be able to adopt/rescue a pup one day. :) 
Hopefully in the next few years!
There is nothing like the look of pure adoration and love from an animal. I melt every time my cat looks at me like that and he knows it. 

He's the best snuggler though so I can't be mad. He loves it when I hold him like a child holds their teddy bear.
PURE adoration.
Ginger love!
Cute
I hope my future dog looks at me like this ☺
/r/girlsmirin
Why do people who rescue animals have to blast it everywhere even when it's not related??
Does this pup remind anyone else of one of those “Precious Moments” characters?
That is much too short of a video.
So pretty
They say rescue pups are extra bonded to their adoptive families because they somehow know you saved their lives.
Now that's a look of gratefulness ! 👍🐶
Do you happen to live in the Atlanta, GA area? We have a rescue that looks exactly like this, and I know for a fact that he was part of a litter of 5.
That's the look of a pupper that wants to lick off some more peanut butter.
That dog has some serious puppy eyes! 

(Our cat is a daddy's girl; I could fall into the Mists and she would never notice! lol)
Ooh my hooman - you are a good one 🐶
Defenition of puppy eyes
Yeah, that looks familiar. Daddy's girl right there.
Leader of the pack.
Can you blame her though? Your husband is adorable
Awwwe! Both of them are looking at each other adoringly.
Pure adoration. 

I'm the main caregiver, so our cats are kind of sick of me. When my husband gets home? Pure adoration. Frankly, it's okay. It gives mom a break. lol
They love each other the most. Best energy for these times and always.
They are both beautiful gingers!
That's pure love right there.
Ya’ just lost your husband....
Rescue pup is so grateful 😍
Total love eyes. 🐶🥰
Me AF. Especially on Sundays.
What kind of pup?
r/GirlsMirin
Your rescue pup is a Disney character.
This really made my day. Thanks.😃
They're both good boys.
They’re so adorable together!
Prince Harry?
AAAAAAaaaaawwwwww!
She's got such a nice crest. You're all lucky!
She would get away with anything if she were mine
r/DogsMirin
The face of true love
He looks like my dead dog😥 i think he knew that he is in a good house with nice "parents"
awww. thats no longer your mans anymore, thats her mans now
Aaaaw that baby. I love animals so much.
Find someone who looks at you like this and you're set for life. Friend, partner, whatever. Just have someone like this in your life. Just be sure you deserve it.
The look of love. That’s the look. That’s the look.
Good boy
And you think animals don't feel emotions? That's  love baby,  pure love.
That's love if I've ever seen it! Take my poor man's gold
🏅
Adorable
Aww they have the same color hair! ❤ so sweet!
She in luv
Thats HER husband now
You need to have Whitesnake’s  “is this love” playing in background.
Triangle eyes 💕
He's a good dude!! Dogs always know
MORE, we demand MORE!
Soooooo you had a husband?
Guys, if she/he gives you this look you know she/he is the one
r/dogsmirin
Omfg adorable
She already loves him!!
So grateful!!!
r/dogsmirin
My rescue dog looks at me like this too, isn’t it just the best feeling?!
We call it " love stare" in my house. Our rescue does the same.They are so precious.
He's like "what's the catch?"
Doggie be like “lookie my humin, him so kyoot!”
OH MY GOODNESS. How cute...
You're married to Prince Harry?
Thats her husband now
R/dogsmiring
So precious! My puppy gives me those eyes and I tell you what, it's really hard not letting them get away with shit!
Miss steal your man
Thats not your husband anymore. The dog has taken him.
That is just too precious!
r/girlsmirin
Is that an Irish Terrier cross?
My dog stole my boyfriend so I can relate
You mean how our pup looks at her husband, you’ve become an after thought :)
The dog is like ''OUR husband!'' lol
Is this love? Is this love? Is this love?
r/mirin
I see a foster fail in your future ❤
Who's husband?
Adorbs
Special pupper. Awww
Paint me like one of your French girls look.
I have the regret to tell you that he is no longer your husband, but the puppy's husband.
He’s got them Disney eyes ;0
Er räddade hund, är så fin o underbar o vacker, på allt sätt ! 
Underbart att se hur er valp tittar på din man. Goa, hund !👍🌺❤️🤗
Talk about total love. You had better watch out the dog will be digging you a grave to get rid of the competition.
Tormond?
I'm honestly surprised there's not a highly upvoted animal psychology genius telling us all this is "whaleeyes" and the dog is actually terrified.

(To be very clear, this dog is absolutely not terrified.)
Her: 🙄
Doing it RIGHT!
OMG, that's one pup in love 😍 Rescue animals are just in a different league of amazing+we so don't deserve them ❤️
So cute and precious! 🥺😊❤
Somebody adores their daddy.
I think you've lost both of them. Congratulations on the new fur baby.
‘Sir I must inform you that full belly rubs are preferred but thank you for the pets.’
Oh my god get that dog every treat in the world.
I could loon at this all day long, lol
Congratulations you just lost your husband to some bitch.  😝
You have a typo in your title.... You said "our". Tee hee
That’s precious!
The guy in this looks A LOT like me... I have gotten two people asking me if this was me... I’m jealous it isn’t. Adorable dog
Stinkin’ up the sofa already
My wife is jealous because our rescue looks at me the same way. I got lucky to be able to be home with him 6 of the 9 months we've had him. Sometimes I pet him and we just stare into each others eyes and it brings happy tears to my eyes.
Dingo are amazing doggos.
Source: shares a house with a dingo.
Wasn't there a lovely subreddit called r/dadswhodidnotwantpets or something? Am I getting the name wrong or is it gone?
I'm going to need more videos of that pup
They do that to their owners like that and form oxytocin, aka love hormone. Especially in the beginning. So if your dog is looking at you a lot in a non threatening or non afraid way it's because they love you. And we do it too, you know when you look at them and your heart just burts with love.
this makes my heart warm after watching someone yeet a puppy off a cliff
Awww
Get yourself a girl that looks at you like this dog looks at it’s owner
This is exactly how Nala looked at Simba.

Bring the downvotes, I deserve them.
I want someone to look at me like your pup looks at your husband
It's like r/catsmirin but with dog
He does not need to speak.❤️♥️
Well this just heals my soul
That’s what mind control looks like! I fall victim every time :)
I wish my gf looked at me like this!
Awnnnnnnnnnnn ლ(◕ω◕ლ)
Awwwww
That's some r/dogsmirin material right there.
Human: gives scratches 
Dog: oh youuuuuu
Want to look at someone the way that pup looks at you ❤️
This is what imprinting looks like.
Such love.
That is a love everyone should experience
The pup knows everyone loves it!
U/savethisvideo
I mean could you blame the pup
I mean could you blame the pup
So cute
Goodbye
I have two rescues myself and I swear they are more grateful than any other pets I’ve had
aww they a both so cute :)
u/savevideo
That’s how pure love looks like
That's the Look,that's the Look,the Look of Love
That look says more than words ever could
both my dogs do this and the look they give you
We must get more clips.
Hey Dad - we have the same hair colour :)
Pure love!
Hi there, love this video! Would we be able to use it for the Daily Star with a credit to you? Kind regards, Ben
Cool
I’d be worried if I were you :)
So precious. Thank you for protecting him!
I would watch that pup, she might steal your husband from under your nose if you aren’t careful
🥺🥺❤️
When your in love your in love
Thats how a Disney princess looks at her prince! You know that grizzly man's heart melted!
Good thing you included they were a rescued animal in the title. I needed that humble brag
[deleted]
Yep. You have been replaced.
Puppy : You dont know the shit I've been through, I just rolled around on my poo just now
[removed]
Is that his dick
