This piggy is too cute to describe!
This is how I imagined Wilbur in Charlottes web was. Also happy cake day!
Awww Babe
My goodness, pigs are such beautiful creatures.
Pigs are adorable
I need the noises. I know piggy is making cute noises.
🕸TERRIFIC🕸
🕸SOME PIG🕸
🕸HUMBLE🕸

I would die for that piggy
I can even hear the adorable oinks, I’m sure he has a lot to say
Yeah but look at those teardrop tattoos next to his eyes.  This pig killed two men in prison.
Looking Sus...
It's so cute I'm furious
One if the reasons I'm vegan, so cute :)
[deleted]
Helpful award cuz this helped me smile :) And also remember why I want to go vegan lol
Suddenly vegetarian.
Why is there no sound? I want to experience the full spectrum of this cuteness.
r/PetTheDamnPig
Why would anyone eat these animals?
Im a simple man, i see little piggy, i upvote
i love how subtle its smile is ahh
Give him some munchies you monster
That looks like the happiest pig I've ever seen... so frickin cute!
all the doughy "carnivores" out in full swing. 

Yes, you tough.
You eat meat.
You strong.
So glad I stopped eating these guys, now I can watch this gif without guilt

Sweetest face.

Yo this subreddit has been killing it with the cute baby animal videos and I am loving it.
It sucks people see these guys as objects instead of individuals
Shit like this is why I stopped eating animals
Reddit is trying real hard to make me vegetarian with stuff like this... r/grassdoggos is already responsible for making me not eat red meat.
That smile!!!
I love this piggy!!!
Pigs suddenly seem more cuter than dogs where can I adopt one
What a sweet face!!  Move over cats and dogs.
Seriously reconsidering eating meat.
GO VEGAN
Piglets always look so happy and full of wonder. Adult pigs always look like they've reached complete apathy, and have no faith left in the world.

They're just like humans! 😂
How can you fucking eat that? 🥺

Happy im vegan
And to think ... most of you here eat these amazing and intelligent beings. So sad
Omg, from the thumbnail i thought it was animation.  This piggy is amazingly adorable!
Heart: melted
Well... I WAS going to keep my composure at work. Now I’m just a puddle. I want a pet pig :(
What a precious sweetheart. Hugs and kisses!!!
Man pigs can be really adorable..

Soft pink baby
So cute
His name better fucking be Wilbur or I’m gonna LOSE IT!
I’m guessing this little piggy stayed home
Awe so clean!
Waddles!
I wonder what people who get pigs as pets do once they get older.

Awww, piggy has an adorable smile... 😊💕
Awe what a babe <3
Babe!!!
What a sweet dear face!
Thats one happy little pig.
I’ve never wanted to give loves and smooches so badly! Look at this baby angel
Don’t support the tea cup pig industry. It is evil and sick
He’s just sitting there... how is that “polite” lol
I'm so upset there wasn't a treat at the end. Or at least a pat.

PAT THE PIGGY AND GIVE IT A TREAT YOU MONSTER!
Question for animal experts. Does this piggy actually radiate happiness and is smiling or does it only appears so to us, because it's similar to how humans smile?
This title piggy went to finishing school
The animal signals to us with its smile that it is in a positive mood, it seems. It has something vibrant on it that is quite enticing. Overall very good quality animal.
Well, guess I'll be a vegetarian now.
If you think this is cute, please stop eating animal products.
Why do people eat these little guys 😓
Weeeeeeee! Weeeeee!
🐷🐷🐷
What a kissable face 🥰
My heart 🥺
I don't know, when I see these videos, I look at them little faces, how curious and excited they are for what their precious little life has in store for them.... while I know the only purpose for which they were even born. And it seem so tragic to me, and so heartwrenching. Such a nasty card some species got played :(
Yo it’s really controversial to like eating meat on this sub lmao.

How can anything possibly be do cute?
Awwww that lil smile face
We had a pet pig called Grynte when i was a kid and she was just as adorable.

This video has made me want to get another, though that would be hard seeing as i live in an apartment xP
is good piggy?
Look at that smile
Oh so pink!
This little cutie looks exactly like Piglet! too cute!
HEY PIG!
cutie pie
This video randomly made me think of the Smell Master 9000 from Richie Rich...I haven't seen that movie in over 20 years....
And the most adorable

I need to get off this subreddit when I’m having my period.  Like wtf I’m crying over this cute ass pig.  My heart hurts

Arrww, you're so cute I could just eat you!
Ahhhhhhhh omygoshhhhhh!!!!

What a cutie! This piggy looks so adorable
If they stayed like that is have one. They are smart as hell.
Why are little piggies sooooo cute?
It’s not just cute, it’s polite
Hello cochinito!
I just opened reddit and this was the first post I saw. It has made my day better
My god, I want to snuggle the hell out of that cute little thing and let my pitbull play with him.

My pitbull legit has [cute aggression](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cute_aggression) and would go absolutely crazy wanting to love on & play with him. 

My poor orange cat knows that all too well lol
Dam that's cute
Bro it’s meant to be polite.
I approve of this message.
Rename small pigs as Snooters. Calling it a pig doesn’t feel right.
SIMBA!
I melted
This is a model quality pig
Looks like he's gonna start playing Minecraft soon
That pig is so pure and innocent, I love it.
Wait tell he two then tell me how cute he is!
This only Feeds into why I want to get a pig in the future
Listen at this point I'm just happy it's not a CG pig rolling on a little ball.

Never seen such a clean snout on a pig. I want to boop it. May I?
Piglets are soo cute
🥰😍
Holy Moses, that’s a cute little bugger!
that smile tho!
the prettiest pink
Don’t know why, but his face looks like quagmire from family guy
If they ever genetically engineer pigs to stay that small that person will have made a goldmine.

Omg, thank you
I needed this cuteness today 🥰🥺
Oooh! Cutie! 🐽❤️❤️
Oh, hai
Pigs are just so cute. I love them. I especially love booping their nose when I feed them. Or scratch their bellies and the tip over on the side. I always loved farm animals. Chickens, goats, cows. They’re just so cute
u/savethisvideo
FYI please done buy a pig as a pet.  They get huge quick And require as much mental exercise as physical. They are quite intelligent
This is the most adorable piglet I've ever seen.
Aka not my ex
I expected something to happen to allow us to see or hear this politness, but there is no sound and pretty much nothing is happening.

I watched this over and over just waiting for the little piggy to get a treat!
My rescue piggy is all grown up, but still polite, friendly, socialable and sings when she's happy. She may look like a sweet ice age horror (the vets refuse to trim her tusks), but she's still the sweetest pet we have.
That smile
BAH RAM YOU !! BAH RAM YOU!!
That’s a very cute piggy
I just joined this subbreddit and this is what i was welcomed with

**beautiful**
I’m only here for the Norm Summerton posts...kihat mommies
Hi, I’d like to talk to you about our Lord and Saviour, Piglet!
Jesus Christ that’s cute
He looks so happy to be included
Omg, that face looks sooooo adorable ❤️❤️
How can something this cute grow up to be so very uncute?
I want a pet pig man...even seeing this I'll forget and still have my hammered in stereotype that pigs are gross and roll in the mud and what not even though I know they are smarter than dogs.

Meh
This little piggy went to market
Yeeeah, I'ma need sound, because there's some oinks in there and I want 'em. Lol
What a Babe.
I’ll babysit

How hard is it to raise a house pig? Not that I would but I’m just interested in knowing if anyone here has experience in it?
He is like “gimmie some, gimmie some, gimmie some of what you got! Please, please.” 🥰
I needed this today.

I wonder how many carnivore hypocrites say they love these creatures, but the way they live life has created personal suffering for so many animals. Whatever you do, it will always come back to you.
This pig should teach the cops
I need one.
Oh hello
I wanna see what he’s looking at. 🐖
Thank you pig, very cool
That face! Never thought a pig could be that cute!
I LOVE!

This makes me feel super guilty for eating meat. 😔
"I'm peppa pig *snort* and this is my little brother George *snort* this is mummy pig *loud snort* and this is daddy pig *massive snort* "
