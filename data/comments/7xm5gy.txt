He's been choking me for years, why aren't you doing anything????
I'd watch a show of all the shenanigans they get into 
I think I speak for everyone when I say we want more pictures of them. 
They really do love each other. Full disclosure, they're my cousin's dogs. But my favorite puppets, EVER! 

Edit: Puppers, not puppets. 
Then and 2 weeks later
As someone who has put up a good deal of field fence, I would just like to say that that is some nice-looking fence on the right. Woven wire, pressure-treated post (6" diameter?), with full wrap-around on each strand. I would even bet that there's a cap on the top of the post to prevent water from soaking in. That's the good stuff.
Your brown dog really likes choking out his black friend.
I gotta unsubscribe from this sub.

I can feel all the "aww" wearing down my lifetime commitment to cynicism and misanthropy.

...I think it's making me...nice...
Great job by black pup. Keeping his chin down and fighting the hands to keep from being submitted by RNC.
That is adorable 
A+ puppy expressions
I'm shocked you were able to get the same pose twice. 
I want to be their neighbor so I can give them cookies at the fence.
Holy fuck, this is cute. 
*music starts*

"My pup pup friend!"
"My pup pup^^friend"
Best cell mates!

Always holding a brother down

I feel like these photos were taken during a dog humping

Dogs can teach us alot about humanity
And both are still doing time 
Omg the tongue stickin out
Them damn ninja onions
In the second picture I can just hear the bottom pup thinking "This is really getting old..."
They're so lovely. What's up with the fence though?
What's the time differences between these pictures? They went from babies to puppies.
Is your dog the one who ate the bee yesterday
Got that Rear Naked Choke locked in pretty tight here.
This is the first picture to ever actually make me go ‚ÄúAWHHHH!‚Äù Out loud.

They are still pretty young in the second photo, it must be only months apart?
Dogs are better than humans. Their minds are straightforward.
Looks like 3 weeks later
"I told you put 100 T-bone steaks in a bag or he gets it"- tan boy
Isn't that the doggo that ate a spicy fly? 
They‚Äôre so cute! I want to play with them...but I know I can‚Äôt...makes me sad I don‚Äôt have a doggie .
"Get off me, Larry"
Why does the black dog not look excited about this ;) ?
So like, three weeks later?
The weak should fear the strong
This thread is obsessed with dogs humping 
happy the year of dogs
Friendship don't have color, race, gender or genre
This is the best thing I‚Äôve seen all day. Yet, do I stop hiccuping 
50 shades of Darker
Is the yellow dog's name Powertop?
They are too adorable to handle! Cuteness overload :)
Adorabubble
Chokehold's illegal, asshole.
Surely you go behind bars after the choking ...not during? Lapse security I say...
I hate to say it but this picture looks like it was taken 1 month later
What kind of dog is the black one 
 Reminds me of a concept pitch for Metallica music video. This one dog kept down by the weight of another his whole life that old man there is me yeah guitar solo kick kick them drums Lars. Or could just be one of the circles of hell for canines. Weird how cute things can suddenly turn frightening when over thought.
Why do they remind me of Naruto and Sasuke..
Start out the bottom, you are always the bottom. True for doggos and dating guys
STOP! STOP! YOUR PAWS ARE TOO WEAK!
Bonus blep*
Why is the black dog still a puppy and the yellow dog is old.. 
Needs more frying
