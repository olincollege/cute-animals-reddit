I had no idea bears purr.
[deleted]
Holding a baby bear like this would be the happiest moment of my life.
Thanks now my wife wants a bear.
Sounds like a little helicopter
I did not know baby bears made that sound! That's amazing.

Also I've literally never been told I look like someone else in my entire life but I found my voice doppelganger. My husband thought I was speaking at first. Nobody will care but I'm excited!
No, that means you're giving it too much gas.
Oh man, that's freaking cute.  No wonder Mama bears will shred your skin off and chew on your skull if you try to mess with one of these babies.
at one point I was certain it was gonna fire up
Man, I love baby animals
It‚Äôs cool that you know what a flooded motor sounds like.
Baby mammals are the best. Pretty much all of the are adorable and as long as you are warm blooded they will probably snuggle with you. 

However, snuggling with baby animals is normally advices against.
They do "purr", it's them sucking on their tongue to make that sound.  Apparently, it means they're content.  Here's a polar bear doing it:  [https://youtu.be/eiE7GNkr9Uo?t=80](https://youtu.be/eiE7GNkr9Uo?t=80)
Man I wish bears were friendly. Even when they get big they‚Äôre adorable but terrifying
When I was a kid my dad worked with a guy who‚Äôs  family rehabbed bear cubs.

I met one and nearly didn‚Äôt give it back.
Jesus, the claws already look lethal
I was today years old when I learned bears purr...
Is this KSL?
Sounds like a motorboat
Stop talking and let that engine purr
‚ÄúDoes that mean she is dreaming?‚Äù Haha the most Emily thing to ask.
They'd be prying that adorable little guy out of my cold dead hands. lol  What a cutie!
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre flooding it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm *not* flooding it!‚Äù

The muffled attack helicopter sound they make is too cute.
It‚Äôs calling it‚Äôs mama.
r/murdermittens
Sounds like a ferret
That's the sound of T-rex before swallowing you whole
Wish she wouldn‚Äôt keep talking
Can I have him? His name will be Boo and we will be best friends...I hope.
First of all where did you get the bear
Is there a teacup breed? Asking for wife. Lol
Wanted to make the lady talk lower üòÇ the cub is asleeeeep
Where did you find this?
My dog does something similar
TIL bear cubs purr
Holy fuck, bears can purr. How the hell did I not know this sooner? Thank you SO much for the post, OP!
Trying to start the engine of gods God's perfect killing machine.
That fluffy ass helicopter is giving me Vietnam flashbacks
cute, but also sad.  the cub needs their mom...
If a cub that young is a way from its mother, than I don't think anybody did anything 'right'.  That is damn cute though.
Now shut up karen so that i can hear it
I'd purr too if she were holding me
It sounds like it's spitting sick bars in bear language
It‚Äôs really similar to the sound ferrets make, just coming from a bigger animal. Interesting. Not the same family but certainly have similarities.
He sounds like my ferrets.
TIL what a flooded engine sounds like.
beary cute!
i want one!
I LOVE HIM SOOOOOO MUUUUUUUUCH

He gotta be doing 200 Smiles an hour
TIL I need to get my engine checked out
Doesn't sound flooded... sounds like a happy carbearetor to me.
Where it's momma tho?
I think most bears do this. He is sucking on his tongue. I saw a polar bear do it in another video [It's at 2:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Opqa10jSwZg)
i didnt know a flooded engine is the cutest sound
That‚Äôs pretty fuckkng cute
*SHHHHHHHH*
I hope we don't find out it was stolen from it's mother and died soon after from improper care like we did with the baby tigers...
So THAT‚ÄôS why my Spitfire wouldn‚Äôt start today. Goddamn engine must be flooded
Shes so pretty!!
I can‚Äôt express how jealous I am

Unbearably cute.

TIL bears purr
Karen just put the bear down

Kookaburras in the old Gumtree:
C'mon! Start ya son of a bi\*ch!

Where‚Äôs mama bear?

I bet she wouldn‚Äôt be happy about this.

I would love to hold a bear like this, but it has to be a zoo, or a rescued cub or something right?
Less her, more bear pls.
Such a sleepy baby
Sounds like good way to burn out your alternator
A "flooded" engine makes no sound ,  
it does not start .
holding a bear cub is now in my bucket list.
That'll be $10,000 ma'am.
D‚Äôawww!
I want to hold a bear
Sounds like a velociraptor
That's what my hedgehog sounds like.
My mom saw this and now wants a bear
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the cutest sound‚Äù 
Me: ‚Äúhold my beer‚Äù as I drive a truck into a lake and then rapidly try and start it again
Just wait till the bear drops the beat.

TIL Bears purr
I wanna cuddle this baby bear. I mean, how on earth do you get a literal bear hug from an actual bear cub!?
So cute!  Next time I'm in the woods and come across a mama bear and her cubs I'm gonna scoop one of them up and give them a big hug and then we're all going to get some honey it will be great!
Ferrets do that when they are excited. Its called dooking
Drop that bass!!
TIL Bear cubs actually sound out the motorboat when they motorboat!

Nice
https://youtu.be/B3qhEIZBlX8 this is what happens when they reach puberty
I think it's cool comments worded exactly like "I had no idea bears purr" get so many upvotes, but if you exactly comment "I knew for certain bears purr" you'd be ignored or downvoted to hell. Not mad, just curious

King's engine

Get some Cosby in a can on the ol sumbich shell chooch right up for you a tell you what
Claws looking awfully sharp for just a cub
That reminds me of "Resident Evil 4", when insects came out.
 That's adorable. I'm going to pick up some bear cubs next time I'm in the woods.
Take my money! I'll take two please.
Scientists need to genetically engineer tiny bears so I can have a housebear.  Like the size of a cat.
So cute:)
A far away helicopter
Very similar to a suckling raccoon kit.  Very cute
Where are bear cubs available for sale
interesting that bears can roar and "purr" when cats can only purr or roar, not both.
That motorboatin sonofa...
Awww so cute!!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
dam it I wish I was that bearcub
I love that baby bear with all my heart now but it‚Äôs eyes look like buttholes
For future reference, the video button is right next to the photo button. Save for future use.
She looks extremely beautiful
Omg. Who doesn‚Äôt love a baby!!
Pretty sure I'd be making that same sound if I was that cub
Didn‚Äôt know how badly I needed to cuddle a bear cub until this moment
COOOOOOOOOOOOOOM

BEARS PURR!?
Behold the most terrifying thing in nature, a bear cub.
"that means I'm doing something right"

Or he's powering up to eat your face!!!
Why isn't this cub with its mother?
Let‚Äôs get down to brass tacks here...how much for the bear?
Cute till you get your faced ripped off.
Bear sounds, cute.  Blonde sounds, not.

If science can make them stay that size that would be pretty cool.
Bear needs some head & shoulders
Why does she have the cub?

I like to make a disel generator starting sound with my throat,its lik th du dud du dddddudududtatata..
And he's cute and all, until he grows a bit and eats your face. It's like Jane Goodall.
TIL bears purr
HOLD ON, THIS THING WON'T TURN ON.
Like turning on my motorcycle. Just heard a big bear purr and it sounds like a harley.
Growing up I had the change to raise two bear cubs until they were about 6mo old. I can confirm they sound like this.
"You are the love of my life," Barney tells his daughter. "Everything I have and everything I am is yours."
u/VredditDownloader
When my family and I were camping out in the middle of nowhere we kept hearing a car engine revving. But we were miles into a trail so it just couldn't have been a car. Thankfully we figured out it was actually a black bear later that night. Do not run toward motor sounds if you're in the woods! Even if looking for help - danger bear awaits you!
Or like Donald duck with a silencer on
I want a bear. I‚Äôve earned a bear. I deserve a bear.
i want one ü•∫
Holy shit that is socute.
"that means I'm doing something right" well would you look at the pillows it has to lay on?

Bears actually PURR!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Bear cubs can purr? Jesus that's the best thing I've learned all month.
Will the bear remember the person when it grows up? Like the video of the wolves remembering their human friends years later?
Baby Trinket!üêª
I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS A THING AND IT'S THE BEST EVER!!! I FUCKING LOVE BEARS!!!! AAAAAAAAGGGGHHH!!!!!!!!!

It would be worth getting eaten by a mother bear.
My dad just told me yesterday about this Chinese couple who adopted a bear they thought was a dog! It grew massive and ended up in the zoo
Bears are cats. It has been confirmed.
I wanna award this but I'm broke
I could vibe out and fall asleep with this lil bearüêª
Why do I get the overwhelming feeling he is missing his mom. I know it‚Äôs supposed to be cute but this video makes me sad. I just want him to be with his mama where he belongs.
I would purr too if I was held like that.
So its a bear-cat. Not a bear-dog.
Demogorgon!!!
I want to know WHY this lady is holding a baby bear! Where's its mother?

‚ÄúThat means you‚Äôre doing something right.‚Äù

My car ain‚Äôt started yet, toots.
Shut the hell up and let the bear relax.
You‚Äôre going too hard on the choke, let off. Keep cranking it and she‚Äôll turn over. Cold starts are always a pain.
I didn‚Äôt know bears COULD purr
Reminds me the ferret's Dooking
They sound like a Rotatory engine lol
Maybe you should just give it back to its real mom
Ttw no mommy bear to cuddle
Did it start after the video ended ?
Sounds like my turbo fluttering tsssssssss thutututututututuuu
