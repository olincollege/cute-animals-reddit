Gorgeous little black fluff, so cute to look at it when it is so perplexed.

WHO PUT THESE HERE?
Cleans paw. Realizes they have 4 paws. Shit I'll never finish cleaning all these paws.
This reminds me of when my kid was a baby, there was a period where she was just so fascinated looking at her own hands.  Like, whooooa wtf are these, it’s like I can control them with my mind....
Does it have some sort of Chewbacca gun strap?
For a second, I thought the cat had a bandolier like Chewbacca.
Just wait till it discovers it's tail, hell is gonna break loose🙂
When you're reincarnated as a cat
This is cute as shit.
OMG... I has, MORE
When you find a dollar in your pocket
/r/learningtocat/
Wait till he finds out the the tail situation.
What did he think he was licking before realizing it was himself?
I was lucky enough to be present when my daughter was discovering that she had hands that she could control. She was about 2 months old and was lying on her back. She was looking intently at one hand and then moving it back and forward while watching what happened.     
This is a development stage that all babies, of all species, go through.
ive regenerated into a cat! still not ginger though
u/savevideo
This discovery gave the kitten quite a paws.
He looks like he's wearing a little bandolier
That's the fakest looking cat I've ever seen
Genius! He realised it at an early age!

This is getting out of hand! Now, there are four of them!
WHAT IF: that kitties just a reincarnated human that got caught up doing cat things but then the human consciouness, fading as it is, took over for a sec and was like "yo wtf im a cat now?!" 

And then proceeded to start licking their asshole lmao
Cutest repost, love dem feets
Looks more like it just realized it got reincarnated 'as a cat' in that moment.
This belongs in a museum, this is one of the best cat videos in history
How do these things work?
It looks like a tiny black Chewbacca :3!
This cat is legit like "bro the fuck....WHAT!"
It’s just like “what the fuck are the nubs that I can move”

Ok, guys, what do you really think the cat was doing with this expression
So adorable!
This kitten looked like its mind exploded with some ground breaking idea
Am I the only one who thought it was wearing a Chewbacca utility belt for a split second?
It's exactly the same for baybees when they discover their feet; it's always a hilariously cute thing to watch.
Aww, babies first existential crisis. Poor thing.
Thats so cute 😍😍😍😍😍😍
😄😄 I watched like 10 times. So cute and funny.
It took me a while to realize he was wearing a collar and not a mini Chewbacca bandolier.
Cute little floor bat
Lic- wait? Wat is this thing? Huh? Another? I have FOUR!
“WAT R THOOOSSSSEEEE”

this is like a moment where someone was reincarnated, and this is the moment they realized it..."wait!...what?!...holy shit!...i'm a CAT!"
why does it have Han Solo’s tool belt?
I have...feet?
I thought this cat was wearing a Chewbacca bandolier costume for like 3 loops.
This is like the opening to a Quantum Leap episode.
