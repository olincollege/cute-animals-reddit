This Gli of Haghia Sophia, she is very famous. Even Barack Obama went to pet her. She is old now, i think 16 years old.

Istanbul has a fascinating relationship with their cats.  There's a fun documentary about it.

So glad I got to visit last year before the world shut down.   After a few days, I didn't feel weird just sitting on a bench and petting the kittens who would come by.   So many other people were.a
He make a big stepy
"Excuse me sir, but I'm going to have to confiscate that tunafish sandwich, it's uh, not halal. I'm a cat though so I can eat it."
Cat: "Just look at this big place they built to worship me."
Cats have always played big in the Muslim culture. It is said cats were companion to Muhammad when he dwelled in the desert  

[...One of the most famous story about them is Muezza, the Prophet Muhammad‚Äôs favorite cat, recounts the call to prayer was given, and as the story goes Prophet Mohammed went to put on one of his robes, he found his cat sleeping on one of the sleeves. 

Rather than disturbing the cat, he cut off the sleeve and let him sleep. When he returned, Muezza awoke and bowed down to Prophet Muhammad and in return he stroked him three times. (which some folk lore claims is why there is an M on the tabby's forehead)

It is also believed that when Prophet Muhammad gave sermons within his household he would often hold Muezza in his lap. ...]

If this is in Istanbul I'd like to give a fun fact.  Istanbul is pretty famous for its cats.  To the point there is even a comic based on it.  I think it translates to Bad cat, it is not meant for kids.

A month ago, caption would be "Museum Security"
That's also a really stunning interior design on the building

Yesterday, I read nomadic Turkic tribes in Kazakhstan had an old feline that they gave funeral rites to, like a thousand years ago... I mean, it says a lot about Turks and the cats lol.

Not too long ago she was a museum cat (because this looks a lot like Hagia Sophia).
It only became a mosque this week. It's a bad sign for the roll back of all the work Ataturk did making Turkey modernize no matter how cute the cat.
2 weeks ago you could have posted "Meowseum Security Guard".

Worth noting that before a couple days ago, this cat was *museum* security. Nationalist would-be dictator Erdogan only recently converted the Hagia Sophia to a mosque, to international outrage.

I can‚Äôt be the only one who thought the structure around the stairs was a guillotine
Let me be the wet blanket and remind people that Hagia Sophia, which this cat is in, has been converted from museum to mosque, and this is an absolute tragedy. Sorry, now get back to the cat pictures.

cats must love mosques - they have the softest carpets there.
The Mosque looks amazing. Cat have a special place in among Muslim especially in Turkey.
I read this first as 'Mosquito security patrol' and did not realize my mistake until after reading a half dozen post. I kept wondering 'well how big of a mosquito problem do they have in the Hagia Sophia?"
Could you hold your joy and call this building a mosque after few days? It's not mosque yet. Also I'm wondering how some people will feel praying in a building known worldwide was Hagia (Saint) Sofia üòäüòä
