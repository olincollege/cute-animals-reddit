Yea, though I walk through the uncanny valley of the shadow of the pets ...
The way the robot dogs' heads move is unnerving. I prefer the smile on the real dog.
It's embarrassing for me to admit that at first I thought there was only one fake dog until I saw the real one...
I love how the default expression on Goldens is "I don't know what I'm doing but I hope I'm doing it well"
*Don't* move. Can't see us if we don't move.
Real dog is the only one that doesn't make me want to tear my skin off and use it to cover my eyeballs. Serious case of the heebie jeebies there 
No one else thinks this is creepy af?

I am among my people. This is as life is supposed to be.
Those fake dogs are kind of freaky 
*wink* "I'm the real one."
Not too difficult to spot the good boy in that animatronic nightmare pile.
He even avoids looking at the camera to play it off and blend in with the rest!!
This is disturbing, they're like zombies. Talk about uncanny valley.

Then comes the real dog and saves the day.
"I feel right Brian, I feel right."
Which one is the fake one?
The Barking Dead.
One of them is not moving it's head. Must be already sick of the holiday season. Some of us are not built for the season
What brand are they?
Dogs must be so weirded out by stuff like this. Presumably they know instantly by smell that these are not real dogs, but also have good enough eyesight to see that they *look* like real dogs. So that leaves them trying to figure out why the humans have these weird things that look like dogs but aren't dogs.
Anyone in NH. Go to Rochester toyota. they have a golden their and he's super happy. I believe his name is duke
"I'm doin all the humans a heckin bamboozle! 😁" 
My dog would lose her mind if she saw this.  She goes after anything with eyes or that looks like a face.
HE'S SO PROUD OF HIMSELF
The second one from the right looks like he's having a seizure
Goldens truly are happy doing anything 
When your dog learned the shadow clone jutsu
I can't believe I really thought these were all real dogs apart from the ones in the tree
The real dog is the very best and the most handsome.  The others are well made.

My dog would FLIP if he saw all those 
“No boy, you aren’t one of them.”

it took me like 10 seconds to realize that the rest were fake...
Golden Retrievers personalities are just insane, so pure and lovely.
Why do a lot of people on Reddit use the term “doggo” and not dog? 
That dog is nervous. He's breathing rapidly and that smile is just him try to reassure himself and maintain composure.
Seriously, though.. where could I get one of these for a friend?
Half expected him to start vigorously bobbing his head like in that gif of the Japanese businessmen. 
It took me way too long to figure out where the real dog was
Well cmon give the dog some money best street performer statue I’ve seen
The ultimate camoflauge
This could easily be a bloodborne boss
Dog...
When the whole squad's fake, but you keep it real.
/u/imersial us in a group
The GIF didn’t actually start playing so I sat for a good few minutes trying to work out which was the real dog. Holy shit, I’m dumb.
One time my mom was really mad at my yorkie and he ran away to hide. She looked all over the house and he wasn't anywhere, and there's not many places he can hide. Mom had two stuffed yorkies in her room on a chair. He was hiding in between them. My mom walked by that chair a half dozen times looking for him and didn't see him. It took her about 10 times longer than normal to find him. I still can't believe he figured that out. Didn't know animals were self aware enough to realize what they look like or what looks similar to them. Even if he was just sitting with them for comfort because he was scared he still had to recognize they were similar to him
When the squad is drunk but you're the Designated Driver
That's creepy! 
People who say doggo are the same type of people who would baby talk to their significant other.

Why has"doggo" caught on? It's longer and I hate it.
When did they become ‘doggos’?  
Why does everybody on reddit use the word "Doggo" I'm so confused
Is stealth doggo. Shhhhhhhh

The way those fake dogs move by the tree at the different angles is creepy. The last time I saw something that creepy with a dog was FMA ..

Edit:  Real dog is adorable though 
Fake dogs are creepin' me out!
He's a real ET!
One of the few things that actually made me smile. Very wholesome.
MUST NOT BREAK CHARACTER
Knew I wasn’t the only who thinks those fake dogs are kind of creepy. 
r/creepy for real... 
Reminds me of the twitch emote: Wowee
I'm sorry but those dolls moving slowly are creepy af to me.
What is with the little black chiwawa on the dogs tongue? 
This is so terrifying for some reason...
The creepy animatronic ones remind me of [the Amalgamate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imwQms4tGDw)!
The unhideable smile gave it away
Does anyone else think these dogs are fucking terrifying?
How can these dogs be real if our eyes aren't real?

This seems to be putting people into the uncanny valley.

Strange seeing this is with animals. It's usually towards humanoids. 
That creeped me out
Why?
That was a little unsettling.
Looks like they all got into the cannasnausages

He's so happy to be with all his friends!
Most adorable fake news ever
It’s like a family photo. You think (know) you’re the only normal one. 
Robots are stealing everybody's job.
This is cute af
Reminds me of a room from Pokemon Moon filled with about...5 toys that look like a Stufful and one, somewhat confused Stufful.
I wonder what he thinks of his robotic counterparts. 
Bro I thought the first one was the real dog
All those fake ones look like zombies 
Creepy as shit
I would be waiting for people to walk by and call that good boy to surprise people. 
Imagine this but they are all fake humans. Now that’s creepy.
Aww
These fake dogs are creepy
Why is there less of an uncanny valley with dogs than humans?  I thought the big creatures were all real dogs.  We've spent a bazillion years evolving together......
I love Golden’s!!!!! Those damn eye brows are amazing and so expression filled! 
r/thisismylifenow/
I'll have what the are having
I feel bad for the dog who got it’s hat stolen
Ed.... Ed... Ward!
But he looks so happy. He found his calling. 
I was laughing hard while being creeped out lol. 
Goldens are some of the best damn dogs in the world. There are other breeds just as great, but Goldens really hit that sweet spot of personality, brains, and temperament.
The dogs look like they're all drunk, even if they are fake

When you turn up to a party sober and everyone else is smashed.
Can you imagine some large alien picking you up and forcing you to sit with a hat on surrounded by animatronic people, in some strange alien ritual for photos?
"I don't want you hanging with those kids. Or you'll start doing drugs!"

"No mom I swear they're my friends but I'm not like them!"
I was searching for a cat in there lol.
I’ll be honest. I can’t tell which one is real and which one is fake. 
He's a better actor than me.
He's so happy with all his friends!
That's cool man , If it had been my dog....Everything would've been torn apart LOL
He looks so happy, surrounded by his brethren.
Imposter in the brown fur
It took me WAY too long to realise that all those dogs on the ground are fake. I thought it was only the ones in the tree...
wait I thought the first three were real, that’s crazy
shhh don't give him up... he is undercover
I am uncomfortable

Man the the tech for animatronics has gotten so advanced that the one panting with its tongue out is sooo life like 
I like how he looks away when the camera gets too close to reinforce that he's a fake dog, too. "If I look away, they won't be able to see me."
I love ‘em all.
This would be creepy if it wasn't for the single Good Boy present. 
ahhhh finally found him. he's the one without a HAT
I imagined a smiling man surrounded by mannequins looking at this. Now, I'm sorta creeped out, and sad.
Rowdy no
Hah, I almost didn't spot those two real ones at first!
The eyes seem to follow me...
Which one is it?
They look like they just got summoned by a necromancer
Five nights at Fido's 
"This is fine,"- this dog about this, and probably everything else.
He isn't even looking at the camera. So professional 
At least they will not eat out of his bowl. Plus, more treats for him.
I just saw this on Facebook
Yeah this kinda creeps me out. The real dog cute as fuck thou.
r/actlikeyoubelong
The one in the front looks so life like
OP can you highlight the real one? I guess that's what you mean
Who's a good dog?
Thanks for zooming in. I wasn't sure which was the real one.
Did he rise a eyebrow in accomplishment or was it just my imagination? 
I need all of them
not all of them are real
r/thisismylifenow
Spot the difference!
What a wonderful surprise at the end!
Creepy
I love how he is sitting there like he totally gets the joke.
That's a lot of cute dogs

The fake one in the middle is broken tho, it's not moving
Genuine happiness. Wow 
I’m always so jealous how other people can get their dogs to wear things on their heads and hold still. 

Anything that goes on my Golden’s heads we don’t expect to ever get back.
The way the dog's belly is moving from breathing is really cute. :)
I don't know what just happened, but I shed a few tears when reacting to this.
Where do you even get that many creepy animatronic labradors?
I just wanna pet him so bad!!!!!!
This is terrifying and it should not be a thing. 
One of these things is not like the others.

He he. It's the perfect plan to stay in the toy store after closing.
It might be because I’m on my period but I cried at this for a solid three minutes
This didn't autoplay right away and I really didn't want to ask which one was real. 
What am I looking at here?  Just a bunch of fake dogs. 
r/actlikeyoubelong
Which one is the real one? 🤔
r/thisismylifemeow
This is a prime example of peer pressure.

Doesn't look like anything to me.
Can you imagine how uncanny valley that must be for the true goldie? That is, if dogs understood that sort of thing. 
I wonder if dogs have an uncanny valley.

 I once had a puppet dog and pretended it was a real dog. My dog got really mad about me acting like the imposter dog was real and she barked at me and took it.
One of them looks like the dog version of [The Scream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream)
Love this! Happy holidays everyone. Even the dogs are in holiday spirit :)

That is so cute. 

Golden Retrievers always look so dopey and content all the time. That's why I love them so much. He's just happy to be there.

You can see the dog he nicked the hat off
So warm
When I was a kid shopping with my mom, I used to sneak off and stand still in the display window and then suddenly move and startle people, or just hold still and try not to laugh as people walked by not paying enough attention to realize I was real.  Based on the dog's eyebrows, I feel there's definitely some self awareness that he/she is "doing a bit".
r/thisismifenow
Am I the only one that finds it really fucking annoying that everyone seems to be calling dogs either "doggo" or "puppers" lately? Probably just me. 
I like the last second zoom-in, In case we couldn’t figure out which one was real 
This is cute and all, but imagine if you had to  pose infront of a Christmas tree decorated with infant humans and creepy  animatronic adults  which only swayed back and fourth while you smiled 
This is like all of those montages in movies where the genius shows the different steps and evolutionary versions before getting to the perfect version of his sentient robot/android.
love this!
It took me wayy too long to realize there was only one real doggo 
I actually thought they were all real except for the very back one was gonna be a dude with a mask. derp

The rest are quite...creepy.
isnt that a golden?

This disturbs the hell out of me and I'm sure kids at the mall are even more terrified.
It took me to the inzooming to understand that there was only one real dog..
This appears to be inside a Brazilian mall... couldn't narrow it down any further.  
That’s a lot of Chicas. 
if only he was nodding his head like a little robot, he'd blend right in

Is that a spot on his tongue, or is it a remnant from the last Christmas ornament he ate?

Downvoted for using doggo.
When Karma is so important that you have to post everything in at least three different subreddits
if you say doggo, you need to bash your head against the wall until you dont say doggo anymore.

Good boy! 
I'm kind of in love with this!
So much cuteness!

Holy shit, I thought there was one fake doggo among all the real doggos until I read the comments. 
this is creepy as fuck
Please don't bring your pet to the mall. In fact, don't bring your pet into any store except for pet stores.

Edit: The only people downvoting are the retards that think they have to bring their dog everywhere. Sorry asshole, but your retarded dog doesn't belong in Home Depot or Cabelas. Unless it's a service animal (Not one of those bullshit companion animals) It has no business in regular stores.
Lol!!
What a good boye
Des muh frenz
What brand of doggo is this? Golden retriever?
This must be a mindfuck for the poor doggo. "Are they gonna replace me with one of these devils".
i really want to enjoy this but the fake doggos are so so creepy 😮
thats the ugliest golden retriever i have ever seen 
How can this already be as popular?
The expectations stuffed animal makers put on doggo booper sizes is criminal
Dogo does a Christmas stealth
These doggo replicants are becoming tricky.
Okay, so you didn't need to taxidermy your own doggo for karma.
Did anyone else look for the dog they took the hat from? Because that is the first thing I looked for after I saw the real doggo.
Why is it breathing so heavily, looks a bit unnerved by the fake doggos 😂🤔.
