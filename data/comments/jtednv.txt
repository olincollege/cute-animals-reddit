Why would you put a thick sweater on a cat.  Makes no sense to me.
Holy shit I have your couch
Is that a Cardigan Welsh Siamese?
Look. At. This. Perfection. Honestly, it made my day a little better.

KITTEN CARDIGAN
This kitten has way nicer sweaters than me
Taylor Swift has entered the chat
And here's your upvote...
Schmidt is looking for you
So stylish
lovely
That's not fair! Firing the cute gun with the image of a lovely kitten -well ok. Going nuclear by putting them in a cable-knit is going too far.
A kitten and a catdigan? To the front page!!
And wearing that cardigan is enough.
all I needed to see today
I didn't know my cat needed a sweater/cardigan so bad until now.
Cardigan?
Adorable. But she already has fur. My guess is she's hot af.
Good! I don‚Äôt think my heart could handle much more! Too stinkin cute!!
Found Taylor Swift‚Äôs Reddit Account!!
Omg where can I get that sweater üòç

Virgin killer.
Thank you
Just a wee cardigitten
What type of cat is this?
Got a cardigan for our mini schnauzer.  It has two pockets.  My husband is going through an existential crisis trying to figure out what our dog is carrying around in his pockets. 

Son‚Äôs gf suggested ‚Äútreats‚Äù but, honestly, we all know he wouldn‚Äôt hold on to a treat long enough to pocket it.  Daughter suggested a wallet, but pup is a gold digger and pays for nothing.  So, . . . ?
So wholesome, and those eyes!!!! What a bean! <3
Okay. That's cute.
Aww, how cute! I love it ‚Äî
omg I am IN LOVE
Lovely
Looking at this made me feel joy like a kittigan
Precious üê±üíï‚ÄºÔ∏è

Nothing less ‚ô• üíï
This is so much more!! The fact that this cutie is wearing super preppy sweater that matches her fur!! What?! Too much cuteness ‚ù§Ô∏è
Beautiful and adorable ‚ù§Ô∏è
This whole house looks cozy, everything is soft and fuzzy
My cats would claw my eyes out if I tried putting them into a cardigan (or any other sweater)!
Don't they hate this though? My cat hates to wear things and she couldn't groom herself - or is this in the place of one of those thing that they has to wear after the surgery? Looks super adorable but gives me so much anxiety :P
My cat is surprisingly comfortable in sweaters. At first it was just a cute funny thing  but then she turned out to be much more mellow when wearing one
I haven't seen a chonky turtleneck sweater that compelling since *Knives Out*.
Thank you.
cuteness. i love it
Awww :,)
That‚Äôs a turtleneck not a cardigan.
Nothing more, but nothing less than a cute ass kitten in a lovely sweater.
Amazing
The post above this for me is the old guy who knits for penguins too funny.
Flippin Adorables mate.
Reminds me of the show sagwa the Siamese cat
What is this breed of cat? So gorgeous
Is there a pattern?
I've now entered the land of feels.

Is this a point colored ragdoll ? Which color?

Such a cutie!üòç
I had a kitty that looked just like this she passed away from feline leukemia. What an absolute treasure so beautiful!
Cute
Where can I get one just like this?
I‚Äôm exploding.
That is the cutest thing I have ever seen. 
Also a little jealous...given that cat has more fashion sense that I do. 
Also more adorable.
My hope for humanity lies not with their humanitarian efforts, but their will and ability to post cute cat pictures.
What type of cat is this please?
catigan
I‚Äôm smitten with that well-fittin‚Äô kitten knittin‚Äô.
Holy crap. Cuteness overload.
Isn‚Äôt that just a cable knit turtleneck sweater? It‚Äôs adorable
Love it! But that‚Äôs not a cardigan.
"The Khajit stole nothing, you see"
Their colouring looks like they have little Ugg boots on
But is there a pattern?
Pull over!

No it's a cardigan but thanks for noticing
Knittin‚Äô kitten
It to be picky but that‚Äôs a cable knit sweater. Still cute as can be but I opened thinking I‚Äôd see a professor cat.
Beautiful baby
Well don't you mean Kittengan üòÅ
OMG SOOOOOOOOOO CUTE- Made me smile
How do I tag Taylor Swift?
Awwwwww
Just a kitten wearing a cardigan, and nothing more

A kitten wearing a cardigan, four paws on the cold floor

A kitten in a cardigan, as cold blows through the open door

A kitten in a cardigan, simple, mild and reserved

The kitten holds its person, warm rest well deserved
Cardigan mean buttons up the front
Please send this to Taylor Swift! üòÅ
I have a sweater just like this.
Cattigan.
I want this kitten. I want this cardigan. I want this kitten in this cardigan. I am overwhelmed.
I hear cats are generally always cold in our homes because we like it colder than they do. Should we put sweaters on all kitties?
An eloquently dressed kitten
It's so cute ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
so cute
Omg. 

THIS IS THE CUTEST THING I‚ÄôVE EVAR SEEN!!!
More please
Love everything about this kitty, from the face to the ears to the adorable paws!!!üòç
How is this post almost to 100K ?!?!?!
Do you know the pattern for the adorable kitty cardigan? My own cat would look sufficiently adorable in one
It is sufficient. 
Thank you.
Cuteeeee
Omg too cute. Can't handle it
Nothing less
Oh my gosh they have a teeny version of a sweater I have ü•∫
So adorable omg
Fucking adorable ‚ù§
So cute ‚ù§Ô∏è
My heart melted. My sadness went away.
Aww! Kitties in cardis!
I beg to differ! An ADORABLE kitten wearing a cardigan.
Fancy cat! Someone bring this kitty a pecan salad.
thats so cute
so cute!
That's a Cattigan
-1 NOT A CARDIGAN.  Fuck you.
Most cats don't need clothes, because they have fur and cats with fur wearing clothes can die off overheating. This is stupid and puts the cat at risk for "aww"-points.
awwww
She looks like she's getting ready to get a pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks
Feel free to share these things everyday
Paging r/TaylorSwift
Nothing to de here, move along
I need to make a little sweater for my cat so she can stay warm when we go out (shes a short hair) but I haven't quite figured it out. I tried the sock method but the sock was way too short

What a sweet heart.
Cutest thing ever!
Kittigan
My son accidentally washed and dried one of my wife‚Äôs handmade sweaters and that‚Äôs about what it shrank down to.

He even showed it to her, I would have buried it in the trash can. 
But she didn‚Äôt get upset, cause he didn‚Äôt do it on purpose.
Hugging and cuddling are the same thing and that‚Äôs it no ‚Äúdominance‚Äù and no discomfort ladeladela...there is literally nothing here to debate phoney poser.
Not ashamed to say I‚Äôve come back to this pic several times since posting. I can‚Äôt handle the cuteness!
How long did she have to wear it? She needs to groom herself.
Someone please link me that cat sweater
"*Won't mew be my neighbor*"
Catmere.....hehe
