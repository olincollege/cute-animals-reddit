Instead of feeling the burn you get to feel puppy kisses
“Aww, what a cute dog! What’s his name?”

“Spot.”
Where does one get a personal trainer like this?
The cutest spotter.
He’s telling you to straighten your wrists.
He is helping!
That tail just waggin’ away!
Man that’s the cutest thing I’ve ever seen. Great upload!!
I would pay for a gym membership there and actually go
Dog is his face mask
Damn. The keyboard coaches are TRULY everywhere.
'You're gonna eat lightnin' and you're gonna crap thunder!'
The only spotter you need
Great workout partner. Always there for the motivation you need.
As cute as this is, is my man doing this correctly? I feel like his form is wrong. I understood you want to push the bar straight up from your shoulders
I want this video to be ten minutes long
I love how dogs are totally cool to chill and do nothing for hours but the second you want or have to do literally anything they're like WOAH WOAH WOAH
This is the kind of motivation I need at the gym.
Close your eyes while listening and it's a whole new video.
This warms my heart because I too love puppies and  can only bench the bar
He pulls you in with the tail wag and puppy breath so he can latch on with the razor sharp puppy fangs
Hey now, that's *clearly* an illegal strength enhancing puproid. We're gonna have to confiscate it (and scritch it's belly).
I would definitely join and be a regular at this gym!!
i would've been so motivated if I were him
Pupper form is always crucial while lifting.
Goldens are so sweet.
I need this. I’m really small and I’m so embarrassed yo only bench the bar to the point I don’t want to do it :(
Don’t wanna sound like a prick but that pupper shouldn’t be in a gym, what if he hopped onto someone else’s equipment and got hurt?
Aww he's trying to save his human from seriously injuring himself in the future due to using very improper form!
Spot; the ultimate spot
You doin' good! You deserve kisses.
Dogs annoying their exercising humans with their love is the best thing ever
To much love. 😍 And respect!😊
Best. Spotter. Ever.
See spot spot
Goldens, summarized
He's helping build up lung capacity by LAYING ON HIS NECK. What a pal, so giving.
He can be my partner anytime and I am talking about the dogo
If gyms had lifting puppies I would never skip a day
If I had this support system I'd look like Arnold Schwarzengger
This just makes me happy!
Glad it is only the bar.
awesome work with the no plate lift!  Nice to see him back from his accident.
Dad... dad...DAAAAAD!!! Lookit.
u/EletronicBee
Me in my home gym, just replace the puppy with 2 cats
I wouldn't be able to ignore the pets to complete a set.
Dogs are the best thing in this world.
...this is a gym I would go to.
like being puppyboarded
Terrible spotter. But still a good boy
Dude I could only ever do one with just the bar. Good for him
The fact that this gets 70k+ upvotes on Reddit should describe what we are as a community. Suckers for puppy kisses
Cute!  But also please straighten those wrists
Wtf is he doing? That is a terrible bench form. No arch, no leg drive, the bar path is terrible - it should be directly over shoulder joints in top position, not forward.
I don’t know why people insult others for lifting just the bar without weights. He’s still doing more than you are sitting at home on the toilet.
/r/petthedamndog
I believe this is former MMA fighter Matt Hughes....he was involved in an accident and 
hit by a train a few years ago, so pretty awesome to see him regaining some physical abilities.

I could really use a dog in my life. I need that positive support rn.
Best gains goblin ever
A-am I helping?
Every gym need a spotting dogo
Human*
If I knew this was coming I would’ve saved my free award
Jokes aside poor form, fix those wrists
Dogs are the best and worst workout partners
Super cute video but the power lifter in me kept looking at his poor wrists, haha good thing it’s just the bar!
That’s actually training for the allergy olympics.
Looks like it’ll be a tough year if training is this brutal.
I have one who assumes that position too
What is he even working on its like a mix of chest shoulders
white people and goldens are reddit’s bread and butter
That form though, add some weights to that and you gonna mess yo shoulder up
My man's at the end of his drop set
Sucks to be blind at the gym
He looks like Tom Hanks.
Now thats some serious motivation! 😤
What Planet Fitness should provide instead of pizza and bagels.
The best spotter
Is that Tom Hanks?
Aww
Guy kind of looks like Rodney McKay from Stargate.
You gotta do 100 sets of a million reps of petting the puppy! Your heart is gonna get jacked!
We don’t deserve puppies
If there is a gym that offers *Face Lab puppy required* in place of *Facemask required*  I’ll sign up!
Emoshunal sahport.
If you’ve never tried to do a bench press while laughing... you have *no* strength. Good thing it’s an empty bar :)
Where can I get this type of spotter
I want to sign up for the puppy workout.
Oh my goodness!!! 😫😫😫😍😍😍😍😍
You see...now thays a spotter i can fucks with
the best spotter
That’s just more motivation to work out! Or be distracted by the fluffy puppy....
“GOLD(EN)S GYM”
encouraging doggo. just what i needed while the world ends around me
Doggo made hooman very stronk, doggo and hooman very happ now!
So cute
It’s ok, buddy. I don’t need oxygen!
If that was my puppy he would be biting the shit out of my everything he could.
Spotting me a little too good there
To funny I think someone want attention
That's the best gym partner ever
I need this kind of motivation in my life.

Keep those wrists straight buddy
u/happycamper_99
Weird worm.
Joey Gladstone and comet???
Puppy just waiting for salt dispenser to start dispensing.
I have a puppy and tried to do a yoga pose earlier this week...ended up with a tongue up my nose.
Where's this gym at?  I wanna sign up!
I swear dogs just love fucking with you if anywhere from 2 to zero feet on the floor
'I believe in you!'
Helping!
u/vredditshare
Man if I have that kinda hype man by my side I would be swole.
Aww

I want a dog so bad!
This is how you get my fat ass into a gym
u/vredditshare
I'm helping you Daddy.
Is this a puppy thing? I adopted a dog a few months ago and he does this to me. He lays his whole head on my face when he thinks something is wrong. I am slowly suffocating, but I think he's trying to make me feel better? Anyone have any insight on this?
Best lifting buddy!
The only motivation anyone could need
Instead of goat yoga, it’s the puppy pump up!
Pretty much. Nothing like puppy kisses on the toes while you are squatting
That shit sounded like a a short porn clip.
My wrists hurt
Is this the next goat yoga?
He’s being a good spotter lol
I bench doggy treats everyday
Tell me his name is spot
Gonna need you to straighten out those wrists, says the puppy
I approve
What a cheerleader.  Better take good care of him. He loves you more than your wife does. Return that love to him forever
Best spotter ever
Gold’s Gym.
He says stop wifting the wets an com plea wit meh
I would like to have that motivation.
Best spotter.
Goldie official BEST NUMBAH WUN personal trainer
Thank you dog
/u/vredditshare
This is the best thing I’ve ever seen on reddit
Pawsonal trainer
Who needs a training mask when you have a puppy smothering you? 😂
Impressive focus. That pup really loves him.
Puppy love.
Hal?
Learned the hard way... Sound: NSFW
Mom
So helpful.
Who’s Hooman?
Would cleaning your ears be of any help to you in this strenuous activity .
An excellent choice for a spotter, indeed.
Wen doggo here, all weight disappear
I want 50 😍
I definitely need a gym puppy.
If only I had an award to give...take this award 🥇
This could get me to go to a gym...
Such a cute video.
That is adorable.  

Please rotate your top knuckles to point towards the ceiling so that you don't put a moment about your wrists when the weights get heavy. Your forearm should point in a straight line through the bar. And please, use safeties. Bars slipping out of peoples hands is devastating with or without a spotter.
I just watched this like 6 times
Nice.
Anyone know why dogs do this? I was exercising at home and my puppy kept doing this
/u/vredditshare
The puppy is trying to strangle him for poor form. When on bench keep your wrists in a straight line, not bent like his.
I would be able to work out for hours
*human?
The motivation you never knew you-- nahhh we always needed that motivation.
This would be my fitness coach at a gym
Is that Lance Armstrong?
/u/vredditshare
Awwwww. He is so happy.
i petition all gyms become like cat cafes, but for exercise
Not a dig on this guy at all, but just curious how much this weighs? I know nothing about free weights and want to get started. As a lady who wants to build upper body strength, I’ve never had the conviction to just jump in.
Pupper is so worried!
So helpful!
The motivation!!!!
It’s so important to have a spotter!
Best thing ever
Nothing would give me more inspiration.
Push the bar back towards your eyes! This is more of a front delt workout than a chest workout. I’d be more worried about your shoulders than your wrists like everyone else in this thread.

Cute pup tho.
thats so cute!!!!
And hoverboard. FFS if you can hit both
Best hype man ever.
Surely Wayne Rooney can afford a proper personal trainer?!
🥰😍 my goodness
wow,so funny  puppy
I miss the gym.
[deleted]
Smart of him to demonstrate without the weights. That could’ve ended in disaster.
In the words of Bill and Ted, "Excellent."
Omg I would go to the gym everyDAY!!!!
This gives me strength!
Worst spotter ever
the thing is, with the puppy’s support, you could do literally anything...
That is his PT support pup.
I love this so much 🥰
Hahahahaha. When I do my workout my Shiba always comes and licks my face too. And it’s always when my hands are in use and I can’t push him away.
That is the cutest spotter I've even seen at the gym!
how bring a dog to the gym
What if the dog was trying to choke him?
Best training partner
The new gym coach was friendly today.
I wish I had a cheerleader like that. The cutest of them all. ❤️
Is that lance Armstrong
Young terminator
Who is this and why does he look like my fiancé
Push it. Push it. Push it. Great spotter!
I wonder if the man himself /u/GovSchwarzenegger has ever had an experience like this
This is the cutes thing I’ve ever seen
Crossfit is getting weird
Best spotter ever 😍😍
That pupper loves him so much already!
Those lil feets though!
If I had a dog licking me I would bench 10000 pounds
Cuteeeeeee!!!!
This could make me go to a gym instead of playing video games for 8 hours
Aw lol
His hype chic 😂
Bar path, wrist position and leg drive could use some work. But more importantly, get a better spotter.
Definitely learned the hard way to not do this with pup in the room and weights on the bars.
Such a good helper!
It's so cute but you might want to teach him to not do that
Dear me what a love
He looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Hanks at the same time
oh my gosh I would go to the gym every day haha. are there gyms that supply cats and dogs? I need to lose this quarantine weight lol
I wish my dog did this to me
I think your dog loves you
That looks like a really ruff workout.
My toddler does the exact same thing while I'm bench pressing.
He got his Paw support.
I'm so glad you don't have lots of weights on that bar with a puppy all up in your face.

That would've made me so nervous.
Not all heroes wear capes
Get u a buddy who can hype u like this
I'm going to mouth-to-mouth resuscitate you.
When Spot spots you ❤❤❤
Literally smothering him with kisses
I’m distracted by that form, really should be going straight down and angling on the way up.
Now this is emotional support
He's such a good spotter!
And the need to do better. No excuses.
Me, *is allergic:* 😩😭
We don’t deserve this subreddit.
Jim: What’s that? Like five pounds?   
Michael: Two and a half. I’m not going for bulk I’m going for tone.
u/vredditshare
Nothing like being molested by your dog, while doing your work-out! :P
r/WatchPeopleDieInside
So much love. Its like a overflow. Purity.
The dogs are the best doyz and girls
Is that Tom Hanks ?
Is that shaggy?
This is how dogs pick up bad habits.  It's a cute clip but puppy needs boundary.
That pup is all over his face, one day the fella might suffocate the dude.
So cute🥺🥺🥺
I would get so strong for him!!
I think the dog knows that human is in pain but doesn’t know what to do
his poor wrists
u/vredditshare
This is the sweetest thing ever
See Spot spot.
Gyms should have Emotional Support Puppies.😍
so much love
So you wore that mask at the gym, Thumb Up!
If your going to lay there, then why don't you just lay on the floor with meeeeee!!
What perseverance!
That seems pretty dangerous.  What if a weight wasn’t properly racked or something fell?  It may be cute but the dog’s life is at risk
He’s holding the bar completely wrong
Its a tired trope but we really don't deserve the little fellers 🥺
My mans gonna fuck his wrists up if he keeps that shit up
This video is the perfect example of "Yeah sex is cool but have you ever been..."
He's helping! Goldens always want to help
The worst (and also the best) personal trainer of all time.
Straighten those wrists!
My dog would do the same thing but very cute
Arnold ?
he’s acting like he hates it but he’s never been happier lol
He is helping xD
His poor wrists, gotta straighten them fuckers out.
 himb halp
why isn't he or the puppy wearing a mask?
Dude reminds me of spongebob
I BELIVE IN YOU I BELIVE I BELIVE IN STEVE
he’s gonna break his wrist if he puts any more weight on his wrist has to be in line with his elbow
Does anyone else’s doggo freak out when they start exercising indoors? Mine does, especially when jumping.
Every gym should have this
God damn his form is all wrong, wrists are gonna be muthafuckin broken if he were to use weight on that. Cute canine doe
Omfg !!! That was sooo cute
I need this puppy to spot me
How else would he have gotten that PR
I have finally found out what it would take to get me to the gym.
Is this one of them fancy altitude masks that restricts your oxygen, so that your cardiopulmonary endurance improves?
Is that Bryan Cranston?
u/vrreditdownloader
Those wrists tho. Oww
My dude should straighten his wrists
awww

Safety first. Great spotter. 🤗
Do you even lift bro?  You're huffing and puffing on an empty bar.
u/savethevideo
Who tf brings a dog to the goddamn gym
Why is he lifting an empty rod?
who decided "hooman" is how a dog would pronounce "human"?
Sure, when he does it it’s “adorable” but when I do it it’s all “Get off of me. Wtf are you doing? Do I even know you?”
Go Hooman Go! Go hooman Go!
Daddy! I halp! ❤️
The best personal trainer, honestly 😌
Well, damn, I would go to the gym more often if there were puppies.
bench bros
I would be working out 24/7 if my gym had this feature
Ok now I’m better
Glad to know my dog isn't the only one to try and suffocate someone with love.
My golden was crazy like this too. She's still crazy over a year later. Best dog ever
Soooo much help!
Why is it that animals can’t pronounce “human” properly?
[deleted]
Dude needs to fix his bench form. His grip is so close that he’s using more tricep than chest, his wrists being bent that far back is going to cause problems when he starts adding weight to the bar, and he should be having the bar go down to his nipples and not the bottom of his sternum. Benching with a flat back and little leg drive also kills the power you can generate during a bench press.
And gonna talk about the fact that he's benching nothing but the bar itself
[deleted]
My wrists hurt just looking at his technique.
Focus, focus.

Does anyone else think this might be staged?  Why is he benching just the bar?
Anyone can do it he’s benching the bar by itself lol
I was going to say that was dangerous,  before realizing that there were no weights on the bar, heh.
45 lbs? I could bench both his puppies
The real story here is those invisible weights
Wait why has he got no weights on the bar? Cool vid tho
[removed]
That man seems super fit. Why was he lifting just the bar?
Ngl with a spot like this i'd be able to rip out 100kg for 20 reps
Brahhhh.... There's not any weight on the bar

Edit: no sense of humor here?
Nothing cute about benching 7.5 pounds.
Ay bruh you got any more of dem **Pixels**
If that guy gets distracted it’s game over for that guy’s ribs
Knuckles to the sky fam, gonna fuck your wrists
Hope he figures out his wrist situation before adding weight
That dog doesn’t look real! It looks like a stuffed dog I had as a kid
Plot twist: the dog wanted to mate with the owner
[deleted]
I wonder if /u/GovSchwarzenegger would approve of this workout technique
Hella light weight smh

/s
That is as cute as the bar he is lifting haha
He’s saying 
‘Do more.’
Bro those are my weights absolutely nothing but 8 pounds! Hell yeah
All these comments & not a single one mentioning that he’s just bench pressing the bar. Weak!!!
Somethings missing.....oh its the weights
My man straight crunching some no weight chest presses. 

Edit: your need to defend his weakness only makes me stronger! Fools!
Dogs usually only do this when they detect something malignant :/
That dog is just letting you know that you're not actually lifting any weight.
Those invisible plates look light AF
I'd be impressed if he was benching heavy weights while the pup was doing that. My dog tries to spot me when I workout.
Just the bar? Bruh
Damn. Take it easy there Arnold Schwarzenegger
Jeez, 45 lbs. Don't hurt yourself!
"Hooman" = downvote. 
That's an Iranian males name. Not at All Cute. OK?
That form is awful though
[removed]
Doggie jus wanna deep throat u w it’s tounge
How can he even pick the dog up?
