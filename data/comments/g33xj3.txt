It‚Äôs sweet how after the initial double take they both exhibit submissive behaviour to the other.
I wonder what the outcome would have been if the glass wasn't there. 

Would they just chill, or would house cat become Lynx food?
For all the people in here saying a bobcat is a lynx they are definitely two separate species. They both belong to the lynx genus but are separate species. Saying they're the same thing is like saying a coyote and a wolf are the same.
You now have two cats.
That cat is an excellent paleontologist. It just discovered the missing lynx!
Bobcat, not a lynx.  Paws are too small for a lynx, and the two are often easily mistaken.
It looks like it was like fuck do I have a kid? Where am I? How much did I drink?
Hey, you. Finally awake
That's cool
That‚Äôs a bobcat not a lynx
Bobcat\*
Sir, that's a bobcat.
It is a bobcat not a Lynx, bobcats are far more use to humans  than Lynx. A lynx ear tuffs are far more defined.
I think that's a bobcat. Lynxes are bigger and have giant feet
It's a fucking Bobcat
This reminds me of all the GIFS where kids greet their grandparents through the glass window because of Coronavirus

Lynx is the genus name. This is not a Canada Lynx, it's a bobcat.... You're confusing so many people on this thread lol.

Do they recognize each other as being cats?

Edit: spelling
I genuinely wonder how a lynx and housecat would interact if they ran into each other? They are so similar, I feel like it could go either way. Unfortunately it probably wouldn't end well
To everyone saying it‚Äôs not a lynx, it‚Äôs a bobcat. You are technically right but so is OP. Scientific name for a bobcat is lynx rufus
Tiny?  That‚Äôs either a very small lynx or a very large house cat.
Love the blink by the Lynx there, like "Hey man, hope this was alright?"

That's beautiful. Where do you live? Where do lynxes live? Oh wait! Do they have little stubby tails? If so, I saw one walking by a road outside Grand Junction Colorado about 20 years ago. I didn't look too closely because I was driving, but I am sure it was a lynx or bobcat.

If you're thinking, "that's a bobcat, not a lynx".

Bobcats are lynx. 

Lynx rufus.
It's an orange cat as well, he probably wants to fight it and thinks he can win. 

Orange cats are magnificently deranged
Just imagine going to your window and you find a giant is asleep on your porch.

It's a Bobcat. 
"Bobcat are a type of lynx". 
No, every Lynx comment here has properly misunderstood the usage to imply common species name. The post is spreading naive misinformation. If you do not understand how to differentiate a species then you do not understand the value of the species.
Mm.. breakfast?

What exactly IS A LYNX...????
Bobcat.
Fun fact. You can legally own a pet lynx in the US and they pair REALLY well with dogs. To the point where it's preferred that you Raise it with a dog from the kitten age and you'll have a big cat with dog playfulness.

Source: a ton of research a couple of years ago after I saw a pet lynx video on reddit.

Additional fun fact. It's actually legal and encouraged for people to own rhino's in certain states in the US. Problem is... No one wants a fucking rhino. Same type of source.

With all of us in quarantine I encourage you to not just take my word for it and do your own research. This killed a couple of days in my life
