Bamboozled
Decoy snail
Are you admitting that you aren't subbed?
Your desktop set up (especially the minimal space you leave for your mouse) reminds me of the nineties and makes me physically uncomfortable.
This would be nice. My cat just jumps on my fingers when I'm typing
I do believe that is a Firefox shortcut. Click to bloop and load
I feel like so many strange purchases can be easily explained by : I have a cat. 

Lol
just get it a heated mat

dont even understand how ur decoy worked
Yeah, but you're using new reddit.  Your cat can't possibly screw up your browsing any more than you've already done to yourself.

/r/TheCatTrapIsWorking 
This will work for a day. Cat really wants to stop you typing. He is just giving you a false sense of success. That's how they suck you in to their cat traps.
Big mistake. Soon kitty will figure out how to use Decoy cats.
Well played sir!!!

Bamboozled.
Still don't know why cats do that. Cause it's warm?  They're jerks with fur? They somehow think they'll trick you into accidentally petting them instead, and after a few minutes they'll gnaw the ever-loving shnot out of your hand?? WHY DO YOU BE LIKE THIS? 
My kitty likes to follow the curser so I can‚Äôt get anything done üò§

Ha! I have sacrificial houseplants for the same reason. Also, what an adorable little fluff! 
You're using light mode! Degenerates like you belong on a cross! 
I like to think that they're both plugged in, and the lower is just a backup keyboard lol
Why the fuck did i get a pm about this
Oh my god, you‚Äôre a genius 
Genius!!
Cats like, "why tf you got two keyboards?"
The cat is also using Reddit, what the hell.
thats smart as fuck
Enjoy while it lasts. When he/she figures out what you have done, well.......all i can say RIP op.
As a former cat owner for literally decades I can assure you, judging by the look on that face, that cat not only understand it‚Äôs being tricked but is also simultaneously plotting your demise...godspeed internet stranger, godspeed
Wait till she realized her butt is not warm. 
Now you need a decoy monitor.
He looks like a cuter version of the Pixar lamp
The look of deceit in those eyes though.
I need a decoy kitchen table with decoy glasses of water
Purfect, when the little floofer discovers your real one, then you can switch to the other keyboard
This is utterly brilliant.
He‚Äôs probably covering the keyboard because he‚Äôs probably thinking like noooo this is the thing that will make him get a cat/dog
Here take my god damn upvote
Be sure to fake type on that keyboard from time to time so they don't catch on

Is that one of those decoy keyboards from IKEA that the buttons don't push down, and they're just rigid and don't move? I hate those things, walked up to one thinking it would press but NO and for some reason it really pissed me off
my cat has the habit to sit on my ps4 cause its warm, now i have to clean my ps4 every now and then ü§£
haha, wonder how long it'll be before it realizes your tricks!
That fuzz ball knows the distraction that ensues by sitting in front of the monitor. 
Nice. LMAO
Too cute!! More treats for that little beast!
Awwww. If he/she ever figures out you should swap the places haha

But now your screen is obscured. 
I too have this issue with my cat...
My black cat wanted to play so much and got bored so easily... One day just started picking off the keys to my ex's laptop so he could chow down on them.  

Also, he opened her backpack, got hold of 30 printouts and removed every single paper clip, scattering them all over the kitchen.  

His favorite toy was paper clips. :) Had to go with plastic coated to protect his hole-punchers.
The way the cat's body is positioned makes it look like an infinity loop.
The cat is saying "The new format sucks."
I just put a fuzzy blanket there and catch two cats on average 
you got bamboozled!
I don't trust people that use reddit from a computer. You're up to something. I'm just not sure what yet..... Oh, it's chicken gifs

A decoy keyboard is genius.
cats probably like keyboards for the same tactile feedback we do, just with sitting instead of typing. Imagine a keyboard as big to you as a normal one is to a cat. Don't you just want to make sure no one's looking, and then roll around on it?
...unless its plan was to get you to post pictures of it all along?
LOL this gave me a nice chuckle so cute!
I did this with my bird but ended up training it to destroy keyboards
When my kitten lost all of her baby teeth, the only one I ever found was wedged between two keys on my keyboard. 
aweess!!

He knows something is up though. Only a matter of time before the decoy fails.

You are a genius, an absolute genius.
Reminds me of when the little baby cousin wants to join in and play Nintendo with the big cousins but there‚Äôs only 4 players. He‚Äôd start crying and crying so we‚Äôd give him the 5th controller that doesn‚Äôt work (and not plugged in) and he‚Äôd stop crying. He‚Äôd happily tap away and doesn‚Äôt know that he‚Äôs actually not playing with us, just happy to have a controller like the rest of us.
Working for now...
I put a cat bed behind my monitor and all of my cats have loved it. It's their main place to sleep. Try it.
He thinks he‚Äôs doing something.. but he‚Äôs not. 
Hmm, I think he‚Äôs the one the posted it

Had my youngest niece to visit recently, imagine a 2-year old miniature tornado of destructive curiosity. I have a PC in the living room, pretty sure they have one at home because she made a beeline for the keyboard...

I have a cat who won't drink from bowls, only glasses, so I had to start getting decoy glasses of water every time I wanted a drink.

Wait til he pees on it.

If you don't have a second keyboard a box is just as effective. 
I need this
why have you got two keyboards
Using Firefoxy I see? 
A decoy keyboard is good and all but when you have a big pet you fell like you want to a decoy house sometimes.
this is genius!!

i think this is the first time i've said "awh!" outloud at something in a long time
Wow someone's using the redesign
Disappointing. You're using light mode. 
Did you steal that from ikeaü§î
Why have I never thought of that!?
You got bamboozled!
"Meow?"
Is that the HV-KB395L?
Our cat once opened html on Google chrome and started programming something, it was a programming language I have never seen before. I wonder what the program would have done if I didn't interrupt her
"Does this bother you?" 

Sadly, the kitten fell for the trap.
Nice mouse
Nice mouse
I think we have the same wallet

This is so clever I can‚Äôt even. üôåüèªüëåüèª
Best. Mouse. Ever. Wish I had 10.
That is my favorite mouse in the world, sad they don‚Äôt make that model anymore 
Downvoted for using the redesign
How is that a decoy keyboard? The other one is crap.
This is really dumb, but I honest to God forgot that people use Reddit on PC. I've only ever used it on mobile.
So you've decided not training your cat out of bad behavior is the better option?

Cats are assholes. 
Ha ha ha this is too funny!! You gotta love cats. üòç
Ha... You fool.. This will merely slow me down... Futile mortal
I love it.
That's why I fucking hate cats, no boundaries, not trainable, no love and toxoplasmosis..
