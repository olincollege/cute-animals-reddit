When my girlfriend brings me to yoga.
only issue with this is that he needs to keep his knees above his feet.
That dip with legs spread is dog body language for 'play with me!' So the dog is doing it back and then getting confused that playtime isn't happening.

The other dog obviously couldn't care less. 

"Yo, can you finish whatever your are doing quickly so you can take me for a walk?"
Ha! This was one of the cutest things I've seen in a long time! He was trying his best \^\^
So cute
I am a tutor, so I visit many homes.  One day I was visiting a home, and someone had their great dane out in the front yard doing his business.  As soon as I got out of the car, the GD galoomphed over to me and blocked my way (stood sideways in front of me) until I petted him.

Doggo knows not to skip leg day, at least.
Thats dogs balls are bigger than that kids head!
Awesome.  He is clearly trying to participate!
I think he is doing puppy play bows, thinking the guy is doing puppy play bows. It probably seems really exciting at first until he realizes (eventually) that maybe the guy is a bit of a daft puppy and doesn't know how to play, only initiate.

\*I am grammarly.

Poor form. Needs a PT

(Me. I‚Äôm the PT. Send him to me please.)
WARNING: hey OP I hope this message reaches the man in the video. This is obviously very cute and funny, but the man in the video is loading his knees in the wrong way and risks injury. When lounging, the knees shouldn‚Äôt move forward as you load the leg. That feels easier so your body will try to go that way, but that pushes your patella out. You should load weight so that the knee stays above the foot. Doing many repetitions of this might injury your meniscus or your tendons. Hope you see this friend !
All I see is black Scooby Doo working his rip ass body
The best of bois.

Growing up my buddy had a Great Dane named Alfie and when we would play soccer in the backyard he used to stand in front of the goal with my buddy and try to block balls.

He was so silly. I also remember when we would play basketball and there was a rebound, Alfie would jump up and try to "rebound" it which usually led to us chasing the ball further.

If I were to do this my dog would just pounce on me, lick my face aggressively and make me lose balance and fall on the first rep. Pretty much the universal reaction to anything I do. This dog is smarter, actually trying to figure it out lol.

Does anyone know why he's actually mirroring this behaviour? Would it be common to get low like that in a pack at the beckon call of your pack leader or something? Just trying to work out if that's some kinda instilled dog instinct he's got going on there for something.
This made me smile)))))))
Besides other stuffs which he is doing magnificently; this dog's size is huge as well! Love it!

My cousins new years resolution was to do yoga. Tried one session and the newfie started humping her. The yoga mat makes for a comfortable floor mat in the bathroom.

Me when I go to a dance workout class and have no idea what I'm doing..but still want to impress my instructor
I know it's not quite the same this reminds me of when I do walking exercises at home. When I walk forward a few steps then back, my cat will follow me up and down the room. I'm not sure why because she's very unenthusiastic about it. Other times, she'll just sit in the way until I pick her up so my walking exercises turn into light weight training as well.
I'm not sure which dog is the smarter one - the one copying the exercises or the one thinking "What is this idiot doing *now*?"
That's a play bow. Bigboi wants to play!

Why are so many people freaking out about the dog not being neutered? It's not a problem as long as the owners of said dog are responsible and make sure he's not around unspayed females.
I have recently had the luck to spend some time with a 175lbs (80Kg) great dane and it has honestly the best characteristics I have seen in a dog. So loving, gentle and cute. Absolutely awesome.
