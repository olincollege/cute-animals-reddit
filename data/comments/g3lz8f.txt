Smudge knows what she wants when she wants, and you better comply.
What a polite and firm no from her!
A lady has her needs
She likes the scratches in a certain spot and stops you when you scratch somewhere else.
Scratch slower damn....
She knows what she wants and is not afraid to tell you.
Aw. I love her! 

My standoffish rescue just woke me up for breakfast with some taps. She will also tap me for attention, but it's definitely on her terms. It's usually three rounds of taps --> quick pets or scritches  and she's done. 

It's taken a long time and progress is painfully slow, but it's unexpectedly rewarding to be a grumpy cat mom.
We have a gray fur bag too.   She was a rescue feral and it took her about 6 or 7 years before she’d even sit next to me.  I feel bad she missed out on all those years of cuddles.
"Human, I'd like exactly 7 chin scrithces. That's enough, thank you."
I’d die for Old Lady Smudge
Here's a tip from a crazy cat person😊: I notice that you're petting her in a way a dog would enjoy. If I were you, I'd try using slower, softer, more flowing and less choppy movements. Fast and choppy movements tends to make cats nervous. No criticism, just a well meaning suggestion! 💜
You might get more pets in if you are a little more gentle.
(Note: chin scritches are normally this weirdos favourite!)
I am cat
I am fat
I want love
Ugh not like that
“That’s enough, child”
“The time has come human. Let the stroking begin”

(Strokes cat for 5 seconds)

“The time for stroking has passed”
You have been blessed by this incredible old lady. This made my morning! What an absolute treasure 🧡🧡🧡
At least your cat puts your arm down. My cat just walks away with this rude look.
That has to be the biggest reward of fostering/adopting a new friend or one who has experienced prior trauma, that slow winning of trust and the small steps forward in building that relationship and love. It just makes me want to cry. It sounds SO corny, but what a fucking great reward, you know? Congratulations on Smudge! What a great new member of the family! ♥️
“Pet me... WITH YOUR EYES!”
My senior duchess is a Russian Blue, just like yours, and she has the same pattern! When she was younger, she was super independent and would never sit with us. Lots of bities too! Now that she is in her golden years, she constantly wants to near us... but only in 15 second intervals that occur every two minutes.
Ha you’re not doing it well enough for her high standards obviously. What a disappointment you are.
alright honey, that‘s enough
Lol who pets a cat like that maybe that's why she wants you to stop immediately
I have an old gray girl named Smudge, too!
I think you’re scratching her too fast.  Go easy.
You should try rubbing her in a more gentle manner. I didn't know this until somewhat recently but if you hold your finger out near her nose, she will rub on it, and that's the force she prefers. Another hint is that she delicately reaches out with her paw instead of a full body thrust or headbanger.

They all have their preferences. Some don't like "scritches" and prefer a wiping motion. Some think they are dogs and want the person in the next room to hear the reverberation.

If you slow your movements down and go with the "grain" of her fur, she might let you pet her for longer.
After reading the title, I'm so glad this is about a cat and not a weird old lady you met in the library or something.
And this is for what I love cats 😻
Scratching really rough there. Try stroking and light scratching!
Are you sure you're doing it right?
Old Lady Smudge thinks you need to learn how to pet properly
i fucking love cats
My cat is similar but instead of simply putting a paw on you when he is done, he decides to take a chunk out of your forearm. The boy is an enigma.

I have the same cat/blanket combo.
“Alright, Ms. Handsy. That’ll do.”
You have to love a self-advocating cat.
try going slower and not so frantic
❤️
Ahhh my cats name is smudge too!! Lovely name!
At least she politely pushes your hand away.  My cat "Bender" comes looking for pats and when he's done he bites your hand.
I love her! Such a grumpy and polite cat. 

My grumpy cat would lure you in to attack.
lol that’s so cat
We’ve got a British Shorthair too - likes the odd scratch but is mostly pretty independent. Of course when they are hungry they are more pet-able. They are great cats and really striking but not super snuggly if you like that.
I like how everyone thinks they know how to treat the cat better as if the owner has no idea how to read body language as they take care of the cat. 

There are some cats that don't like being pet at all no matter who the person is, and some like it a lot more rough and playful than others like a dog - just purring & rubbing all over you for more fur fluffing. Their personalities come in all shades of a rainbow. 

Just enjoy the post and don't be imposing backseat pet owners.
ITT everyone acts like they know the cat better than its owner does, while the owner reassures them that they do indeed know their cat.
Be patient with her changing moods, she is just old ...
Cute old lady, I have noticed the older my cats get the less they want fast scritches, and the more they want slow scritches. Maybe worth trying it slower.
Look it at the all cats experts here trying to tell the owner how to pet her own cat.
hahaha I have a cat like that and when she does this we always imagine the cat saying "I'm done, here's cab fare"
She might be looking for some gentle scratches brotha!
To be fair, those scritches looked kinda intense.
That’s cat ownership in a nutshell.
That solid NO gave me a good chuckle
Aww how polite ☺️ this makes me feel so warm. I wish I had a cat right now
She's so cute and polite!
*aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand* scene!  \*cut\* \*print\* \*that's a wrap, folks!\*
I also have a British shorthair, and mine is the exact same! She’ll come ask for pets, then leave after 4 seconds or so, it’s enough for her.
Pet me human
awesome
Our adopted cat looks the same and does the same thing. Asks for some attention then tells us to sod off after about 5 minutes.
Gotta appreciate when they are more direct and let you know what they want. No mind games or guesswork required. I guess that's why so many prefer the older ones.
How did you know she was about to ask you for scritches? Curious as to how you had the intuition to record this brilliant moment.
Chin scratch chin scratch ok that’s enough.
>Old Lady Smudge   

Oh god oh no what is thi....  

>cute picture of a cat   


....OOOOOHHHHHHHHH.
And some people say cats can’t communicate with people. She practically spoke to you telling you exactly what she wanted
*I still don't like you, but I have an itch.*
What a sweet old lady!
That will suffice, peasant.
We had a cat like that.  She was a  outdoor cat for 5 years before she started coming inside. Now she is 15 and basically never goes outside anymore. She is not particularly affectionate accept when me and my wife both lie down to go to bed, and she is convinced that we are moving anymore or getting up, she will jump in between us and permit us to pet her for about 5 min.  She will then sleep there that night. All other times, she hisses at us if we try to pet her.
Typical British Shorthair
You aren't stroking her right. Way too fast and harsh. Got to be super gentle.
"Bah, terrible..."
If you're very patient and there's a treat she likes, you can probably get her to let you pet her for longer periods of time. Say, for example, that she will let you pet her five times before you get *the paw*. Do that, don't try to pet any more than that, and then give her a treat. Keep doing that for a week or so and then see if she will let you pet her six times. And so on. If you're very consistent, eventually she will associate happy feelings about the treat with happy feelings from petting, and her oversensitivity to petting will decrease. If you're worried about giving too many treats, you can break them up into half or quarter treats depending on what kind she likes. The important thing is just to have a positive thing for her to associate with petting. It's something we do in the shelter I volunteer at for cats that with hypersensitivity issues, and if you're consistent it can be very helpful.
My cat is the same :)
What breed of cat is this? Always wanted one.
Everyone in this thread telling OP how to pet her cat like she doesn't know her better, just stop.
Try doing it gently.
Try reducing your scritches per minute, looks like the old lady is just overwhelmed
Cats have trained us well.
Smudge is such a perfect name for such a cantankerous lil cutie!
Old lady smudge 🥰😍😭
Smudge 🥰
I love bossy girl kitties!! My girl has a similar attitude 😻
Good BSH!
I have a very similar blanket and my cat LOVES it. We call it her biscuit blanket because she’s always making biscuits upon it.
Tsundere cat
Love her name.
This is the most cat thing ever!  
She's a gorgeous lady.
What's the breed of her, i want to adopt one.
Old lady cats are a treasure 💙
She is the typical cat! Funnily enough, my first cat was called smudge, she lived to the grand old age of 16 and she was exactly the same. When she wanted attention you knew about it. When she didn't want attention you SURE knew about it. Missing that huffy, alien looking fuck.
This must be a British shorthair thing. Mine does the same!
its the best way. let them make all the decisions.
I used to know a smudge 💖 such a good kitty name.
That’s my calico.  She’ll come up and rub against you and purr like a Harley and then bite you if you pet her more than twice.
Beau gris Grande Dame-she is communicating more effectively than some adults I know!
She fluffy, and she demands fluffing.
Lol. Smudge has hoomin trained well.
Aw my first kitty was Smudge
I love how polite yet also sassy she is.
Aw my pup is named Smudge. We call him Old Man Smoo. Old Lady Smudge is a pretty kitty.
What a good polite kitty
Awwww what a cute old lady ❤️
Oh bless! What a sweet pea :)
Our kitten is named smudge too! Love the name!
My cat does this sometimes, only she’ll stop your hand with her paw, sniff it gently, and then suddenly bite it kinda hard. 

I’ve found that she prefers when I scratch her very gently, to the point where I can just barely feel her fur on my fingertips. Then she’ll slowly lean into it, applying her own desired amount of pressure. 

Then the biting is just for “fun”, and it’s not quite as hard.
Aw man he looks just like my first cat, Big Kitty. We always thought he was a british shorthair but weren’t certain as I just dragged him home one day as a kid. The best cat personality I have ever met.
Any relation to Smudge Lord?
You shouldn't focus on one area when you pet her, most cats would push you away. Scratch her cheek and ears too.
Try scratching at the very center of the top of her head. My cats loved that spot.
Just FYI, not all cats like neck scratches (I've personally never met one that did), many actively hate them.

Pet the cat's head, and gently behind the ears. Remember, a cat's not a dog, so be very gentle.

The cat in the video hates neck scratches, that's why it's saying no.

Edit : reddit, how can you ignore obvious signs?
That's because you're being shitty and obnoxious about it. There's no way you think aggressively attacking her chin like that is pleasant for her.
Check if she likes gentle stroking around ear  more.
Rough.
She wants an ear rub, not a chin rub!

:Edit:

I love how this gets downvoted.
Scratch softer, she’s an old lady!
Behind the ears, not under the chin hooman
You just need to learn how to pet the cat the way she likes and not attack her neck so weirdly
probably because you scratch her chin, go by the ears.
[deleted]
There could be a better way of doing this. I'll tell you how I like it.all the animals like it too.
1: pace urself.do not stroke too fast 
2: never stay on the same area,, pretend you are painting something with ur fingertips 
3: pay attention, the body responds to the sweet spots, make sure you don't over stroke those areas  frequently or it might loose it's sensitivity.
Some reason I cringe when people refer to petting as stroking.
Maybe stroke her back instead of going for the chin like that?
Slave of a cat.

Didnt know humanity could go there.
This should be posted in r/animalsbeingjerks with the title:
“You, pet me. No, no, stop. You’re doing it wrong peasant.”
Need to learn how to pet a kitty man that’s why she is stopping you
That's because you're doing it wrong!
Maybe she wants to crawl in your lap?
Rub her belly and she’ll become more compliment.
