I get why you guys are telling me to get another cat but the thing is that I already have two! The other one was at the vet for a senior check up so they has a nice reunion after those, for all parts, difficult 30 minutes
I got a WiFi camera for Christmas and learned my cat sleeps by the door when I’m gone. I never want to leave now.
How could you not show us you coming back and the cat being happy again?
Oh my. I think I'd stay in quarantine forever to make sure that cat feels loved.
Those poor sad meows. Reminds me of my old cat when everyone would go to bed, she'd sit at the bottom of the stairs and make the same sound.

edit: updating with cat tax

Oh that mournful sound
I've seen studies that are trying to figure out, "Do cats actually love you?" and the common thing I've seen is, "Well, they're cats so they frustrated our attempts to measure anything, but they do scream like the last creature on earth when you leave." I'm paraphrasing.

edit: cat tax is this real? And how'd you know to message me about my cats? I never said I have cats. Here are two of my cats. https://imgur.com/gallery/h2Hx7Ng
my cats were very concerned about what your cat was saying

My friend’s cat makes this exact noise except that he follows it up with bringing you his stuffed toy so he can hump it in front of you while you awkwardly try to ignore him.
Mine will occasionally meow like that when I'm on the toilet. I just scream back, "I'M TAKING A SHIT, LEAVE ME ALONE!". He seems content with that answer.
I read once that cats meow pretty much to communicate with humans.  Bro is cryyyyyyying
This made me cry a little. My Conker kitty used to do this with a shoelace as well. Didn't matter if I was home or not. In a little less than a week it will have been 4 years since he passed away and I still miss him so damn much. I chose to have him cremated and was allowed to have a shoelace cremated with him. Might sound silly to some but I had that cat for 16 years. He was with me through so much and he went so suddenly.
I left my webcam on my laptop when I left the house once, 6mo old kitty was doing the same thing, we went and got her a brother so they would hang out with each other when we are at work. Broke my heart, your kitty needs a pal!

Get another cat. 

My cat used to be at the window waiting for me each morning when I came home. As soon as as I got out of my car and she saw me, she started meowing. 

Then, I got another cat. The two cats never really became great friends, but my first cat wasn't in the window waiting for me every day. She had another cat to keep her from being lonely.
Sad awwwww 😔
Cats hate being alone.  When we go on holiday we always have neighbours, friends, family check in on our cats twice a day.   When we return there is a 3-5 day period for the cats to adjust to us being back.   It’s stressful for them.  But This year we hired a full time house sitter.  Noticed a massive improvement in their behaviour when we returned.
This is devastating to watch
I miss you, hooman! You come play and pet me now!!
“Hewwo?”
I have four cats. One of them does the exact same thing with strings. He walks around the house with them and yowls. I’ve come to understand it’s a hunting behavior and he’s announcing that he has caught something. He’s not lonely, that’s for sure.
[deleted]
My buddy howls and whimpers when he thinks we've left the house. It always makes me sad to think he cries when we aren't there to reassure him.
Video ends too sooon! Its gonna be sad forever in our minds now
Is that a leash? Are you sure that's not a dog?
I think its time to get another cat, man.
Turned on the sound. My cat immediately came over to see what's up. Apparently it was very concerning.
r/catswhoyell
Our cat does this too! String and all! Wow
I think she’s looking to take the dog for a walk.
I got a kitten back in September 2017 after hurricane Irma... She got super attached to me and the first day I had to go back to work (three days after I got her) I came home and she couldn't meow anymore.  Kinda panicked but she seemed otherwise fine so I just called my vet for reassurance.

Damn kitten meowed so much while I was gone she lost her voice.

She got it back after 2 days though :)
My cat is currently losing his mind and trying to find the sad kitty so he can comfort it.
She’s announcing that she brought you her string that she “killed” just for you. My old kitty would bring me inanimate objects and announce it just like yours. She’s not sad, she’s proud.
My cat makes those cries in the middle of the night if I go to bed without informing her.

My last cat was over 20 years old and had kitty dementia.  She did that mournful howl EVERY SINGLE night and was deaf (the howling was kitty nocturnal "sundowner's syndrome") at 3:00 a.m.  It broke my heart and my brain.
I have two girls and they’re really good friends so I never worry about them getting lonely but they are ALWAYS at the door when I come home after work so I know they miss me . People that say that cats aren’t affectionate or attached are fucking stupid
Please take kitty for a walk!!!! *cry*
That was heartbreaking...the meows kept sounding like the poor kitty was yelling “helloooo?”  

I want an update of when OP finally came back and there was a happy reunion.
My cat woke up from his nap, and then promptly dozed back off. The dog however has begun searching the house out of what I can only assume is sheer terror that there might be a secret cat somewhere. He is very scared of cats.
Those aren't tears, I just got out of the gas chamber at basic military training.
Good lord this is my husband's cat. 

Same yowls. Same jackassery. 

Also a medium hair flame point. Soft as bunny fur.
When I was in New York for a week with my Dad, apparently Kao (my Cat) would always come to my bedroom door, trying to check if I was there.
You hug that cat right now!
Dear God! Never leave again!
She got you this awesome gift.  And no one to congratulate her amazing powresss
My cat usually does this if they have a nasty surprise waiting for me. I translate it to “dinner’s here, you pathetic human that can’t hunt for yourself!”
Please record you playinb with and him being happy cos this is depressing 😢😢
Is that her leash? Do you take her for walks?
My dogs were very worried about your cat
There’s a simple solution: PLEASE get another cat.  The kitty needs a sibling/playmate/someone else to love.
My cat does the exact same thing! He has this shoelace that he carts around while crying every time I leave or if he thinks I’m about to leave.
I'll never forgive you for not showing us an image of you finally petting that cat.
One of my cats is laying next to me in bed, cleaning herself. I played this video, and she instantly stopped and started looking around, concerned. When the video sped up, she went back to cleaning, but every time it slowed down, she got worried over the meows.

My cats don’t react often to the cat videos I watch, but this one really got the cat next to me worried.
Get another one
We have four cats. Anytime anyone of us leaves our orange boy does this. Doesn’t matter that there are still three other people in the house, he carries around his toy and cries for who ever just left.
My Ragdoll  does this when he has captured one of his toys 🧸. He walks around with his “minkey”in his mouth yodeling then plops down so proud of himself. To the hunter goes the spoils 🐈
My cat does this ALL THE TIME. She makes these noises when she's carrying around her toy, just like yours does with the string. My boyfriends cat has recently started so I assume he picked up the habit from my cat. My parents cat would do it too, so I assume it's just them playing.
my cat meows exactly the same! I always hear him from across the house, he sounds as if he's gotten lost and is calling for help. also, when I played this audio out loud my cat got real wide-eyed and freaked out.
A lot of pets will be so depressed post-covid.
Time for that cat to get a buddy. Fo adopt a rambunctious little monster that will straighten this guy up.
My fat boy, Rocky, yodels like this every night while bringing kitty collars from the living room basket into my bedroom and arranging them around my bed. 

He also yodels when pooping....

Cats, man.  What even are they.
After all that, there is no ending moment when you walk in to make the cat happy. 

I want my money back.
Dude this video made my super shy chill cat freak her eyes were so big and she was like practically on my shoulder. I’ve never seen her act like that. Please get another cat so your cat doesn’t cry from separation anxiety like this it is heart breaking. Cats breed looks like a rag doll.
Video ended too soon. I really needed the resolution of you opening the door and your cat casually walking past to reassure itself you were back, and then promptly ignore you for the next five hours.
My cat heard me watching this and came in to yell in solidarity.
You think this is sad, you should see the video of Stella, the dog that talks by using pre recorded buttons. Her owner is a speech therapist named Christina. She set up a camera while she was out. Stella would look at the door and howl in a sad way, and go to the sound board and hit "help, where Christina"
Or when she's getting ready to go to work the dog will say "no outside"
My cat only makes this noise when she walks around with her toy lobster. I’ve never heard another cat make this noise before.
My cats are always in the same place they were in when I left, but once they wake up and realize im there they come over.
First part of video sounds like he’s “Hello? Hello?”
I couldn’t even watch the whole thing. Had to go hug my cat. (The void is not pleased)
Can you please upload the part where you get home? I want this to have a happy ending!
That last one made me tear up bro. That poor kitty is so lonely.
My cat does this when I go in another room.  She has a special toy that she picks up first, similar to this kitty. She sounds like she's in distress but she will often bring the toy to where I am and drop it.  Then if I throw it she'll get it and bring it back to me.  I have no idea what she's thinking.
my heart is broken
u/vredditdownloader

Aw, this sound is so heartbreaking, concerned and lonely. Imagine this going on for the rest of the day while you are at work. : (
I dont have cats YET. But when I finaly get them.. I will get two, possible brothers.. so they atleast got each other while Im working :)
My cat just woke up, contemplating what she heard..
I think your cat missed you, and wanted you to come home.
But I'm no Dr. Doolittle, that's just my uneducated guess..
*edit : grammar
Purranormal activity
My kitty does this whenever I leave the house, even if my husband is still home. She's especially forlorn when I take the dog for a walk.
This made my cat start calling back for the video cat. Now he won't stop even though the video is over. Thanks VideoCat.
"Herrow?"

"Herrow?"

**"Herrow?!"**
Yes I would like to invest in the 'Save your kitty from whatever they think is wrong' fund.
Where's the reunion video????
This cat is ***bored***
Mine does this with my socks. It first started with my son's when he wasn't around. After he moved out, then the cat changed to my socks...and I can just be in the other room.  I'll pop my head around the corner and he'll look at me like OH, there you are, what a surprise!  :D
My cat does the exact same thing, but with a stuffie. Anyone know why they do this?
So this is weird, but when the other cat dies, if you have to put it down, make sure this cat gets to see the dead body.  It's the only way we can "tell" the animal it's friend has died.  Otherwise they'll do this really sad searching behavior for quite a while.  Weird thing to say, I know, but I thought you should know
Awwww! So sad!


My cat Otis is deaf and makes this sad noise whenever he can't see me. Especially when he wakes up and I'm not right there. He does it until he finds me. Poor guy.
Where's the reaction to you coming back?

OP, you cannot leave is in emotional distress with your car like this! 

We need to see him/her happy again.
We have litter mates, a boy and a girl, that were found in a sewer at four weeks old. They were super bonded as babies but now rarely snuggle or play, and one big reason we foster is to give the boy cat someone to play with so he's not constantly harassing his sister until she fights. She's a drama queen who regularly hisses or growls at him. 

But at night, if he's in bed with us and she makes this noise, he goes SPRINTING to find her.
This thread makes me grateful that my cat doesn’t GAF about anyone and only meows like this when he’s locked out of somewhere
This is why you need to have more than one pet. Two cats, two dogs, cat and dog. It relieves loneliness and distress.
I'm officially heartbroken
I can haz toasted marshmallow?
He sounds upsetti spaghetti
Why is no one asking this? Do you walk your cats?
When out cat Bobby did that he had a mouse toy in his mouth. i always imagined it was him pretending to be the mouse saying "Nooo! Let me go! Bobby your so strong!"
“What do you normally do when I’m gone?”

“Wait for you to get back.”

Never before have I seen such a better example of this Spongebob quote.
I watched this with one of my cats on my leg. As soon as the cat in the video started whining, my cat did not like it. And my other came into the room to see what was going on. Lol.
This made me so sad, I went on vacation for 3 days and my dad said my cat just sat in the window the whole time, when I got home I was bombarded with screaming meows and demands to be picked up which he hates and now I feel guilty whenever I just run to the store.

He’s such a mamas boy
I think my cat just ran out here to console your cat. He's still looking all over for him 😿
Great. Now I need to find out a way to bring my cat camping.
My cat does this at 4am every morning. Wanders the house calling for somebody. My other 2 cats are usually sleeping and completely ignore him.

He only stops if one of the humans calls him and then he runs in to them and cuddles up until breakfast time.
Geeze why the hell is this so damn sad when it's just a cat? Oh... cuz I miss my cat back in 2000.. RIP.
Watched this with the sound on and my tabby ran into the room with a worried look and searching for another cat.
This is the first cat meow recording my cat ever cared about.  Whatever your animal is talking about deeply resonated with my cat.
He needs a friend. Looks like you're getting another cat. Congratulations!
My cat did not like this
This made me sad. So sad I teared up. Give your kitty a big hug for me, I just hugged my cat and the bitch clawed my arm up, again.
One of my cats is a bit senile and has to be reminded that the other 4 animals and 2 humans haven't all disappeared. She makes this noise when she doesn't see anyone for a few minutes. I have to call out to her and let her know we haven't died.
CaTs DoNt Love HuMaNs

For me this is proof that they do
My wife showed me a video that she took of our cat because she cries every time I walk out the door even if it’s for just a minute. Even though she won’t come near me during the day.
My mans said hewwo
*checks to make sure camera is on*


OK, time to milk this for all its worth.
My cat used to make the same noises, like at 3am, I guess she felt lonely because nobody was awake, to play with her or give her attention. But then she died like a year ago, so now all I hear is silence when I can't get to sleep at night...
[deleted]
😭😭😭😭
Kitty is so lonely 😢😢
Endearing
My heart broke
So much for the whole idea that cats don’t care if you leave all day.
My cat used to cry like this when he pulled his bungee mouse off the doorframe and wanted it hung back up... at 3am. We started putting it away in a drawer at night. Toys aren't fun when they aren't being dangled or shook around by someone else.
I volunteer myself to keep your cat company forever.
I like to think that cats *do* feel affection for us, but it's much more human than with dogs.

Like, your cat wants to be with you, it wants to sit and chill and watch TV with you, but it doesn't want you all up in its face bothering it.
You literally can never leave ever again. It’s illegal.
Poor kitty! Never leave that baby again!
It’s soooooooo saddddddddd
For evenings of not being alone, you give full days of loneliness.

I never understood the point of having a pet when you leave it at home without you, or another animal.
That’s some separation anxiety... please get one of those apps so you can FaceTime your cat!!!!!!
Why wasn’t there a part at the end when you return!
Oh poor baby. You're right OP, this can never happen again. Thank you for bringing his bro back home.
I DEMAND you provide a follow up video of you walking your cat or whatever it is trying to do with that leash.
I have set a timer on my TV to turn on at noon for an hour and another on my alarm radio at 2 just to create some noise for her and give her a little bit of entertainment.
Human?  


Humaaaaan!  


\*Brings toy\*  


Maybe if I bring this, they'll come back! Q\_\_\_Q
Headline next week:

"Reddit User Strangled In Sleep By Leash Under Mysterious Circumstances, Police Rules Out Homicide"
“hello?”
Need another pet friend for your cat
Seperation anxiety is very common in animals. They don't know if you will be coming back or when you will be back, their brains can't comprehend that so they think you're gone forever.
YOU BETTER TAKE THAT CAT FOR A WALK!
Needs a buddy
Hmm this kinda makes me feel "aww cute" but mostly "awww poor kitty, he sounds so sad and.lonesome somebody do something!"
Whenever someone posts on reddit and they're hurting or in distress. We all come on and give love and help if we can.
All the cats heard her distress and tried to give comfort. 
The feels are real.
Main coon ragdoll mix? My old cat used to make that same sound if I didn't carry him up stairs when I went to bed (he couldn't see well in his old age) After the second day I asked the vet what that noise was. She said he cant find you. My heart broke instantly. Never failed to carry him up stairs with me when I went to bed ever again.
I have two cats and one of the might only briefly cry at the door right as we leave, but will quickly go find her brother and chill with him instead.

If you adopt kittens, you should always try to get a pair, and NEVER split a bonded pair.
my cat does this exact same thing with an old hoodie string!!! we call it "string screaming" and it is my favorite thing
You need to put up more things for your cat to do
OH MY HEART
Cats make that sound when in [heat](https://www.catster.com/cat-behavior/cat-in-heat-sounds-what-do-cats-in-heat-sound-like).
My cats came running when they heard this.
Poor kitty.
it’s  poor little heart!!💔
It’s like it’s asking “hello”
A potencial r/CatsWhoYell star. 


And you better have petted and squished this kitty after you cane home.   
^(We take our human scolding very seriously there)
My room mates cat did the same thing, except she would carry around a little tiny stuffed lobster and moan with it in her mouth.

Sweet girl unfortunately developed a heart condition and became severly sick. She died a week and a half ago. But seeing this lovely kitty made my heart happy and remember just how cute our girl was. :)
I think that is the "Where is my family sound?  My cat makes that sound too but its when she needs attention."
My heart broke, just a little bit
Whyyyyyy doesnt this video include happy pets at the end?
"I'm so lonesome I could meow".
My cats only screams at me for food..
That's a weird looking dog
It sounds like it’s saying “Mom?!”
Hey. I don't want to be alarmist or anything but I would be really careful with that cloth thingy. 

My cat has eaten approx. the same size cloth. And When We realised it was like he was throwing up his bowels out. He then ate it back before i could even react. 

He had to get an operation to remove that fucking cloth out. 

So it's nasty.
“Helloooo? ... heeeelllooo?”
Can you post another video of your cat happy so we know it’s alright
I feel like I'm getting suckered into believing this cunning mini tiger is sad....hoomin no fall for this. Good kitty though and many snuggles when I iz there!
I WAS IN A GOOD MOPD AND THEN I HEARD THIS VIDEO AND NOW IM SAD

THANKS ALOT
This broke my heart, and some people think animals don't have feelings 🙄
That's a dog sir.
That’s a weird cat even by weird cat standards.
Great now my cat is freaked the fuck out behind my desk trying to find the cat in the video.
You monster.
I’m not crying! You’re the one that’s crying! All jokes aside I miss my cat now!
Aw. You should get another cat so he/she has a friend :3
I’m hoping you have another cat based on how freaked out this one is. Usually they are much calmer with any company.
I was waiting for the moment they returned moment.
When my cat does this I call it lonely meowing
Why do his little meows sound like “hellooo?!”
And what happened next? He likes go for a walk?
I was wondering if my cat does the same, but I remembered that he's an "anti-human" cat
Post a video of you returning home and petting the kitty! We need closure!!!!
My cat went apeshit hearing this :D
My heart can't take this.💔 Poor kitty 😭
Oh, that makes my heart hurt.
r/petthedamncat
GET ANOTHER CAT MY DUDE!
THEY'RE NOT HOME IDIOT
My cat does this with a dish towel in his mouth when we go to sleep. Usually for about 10 minutes. The first night we brought him home. he broke my heart with it. Now we just laugh. It’s every night, and it’s a different dish towel every night. We tried getting a towel just for him. But, he’s not interested. He NEEDS a towel that we have used. I have no idea what it all means. He knows he’s welcome to come sleep with us if he wishes.
This is why you must buy two kitties. They will keep each other happy (or it will at least stop them from crying) while you are gone!
This is more frustrating than the entire pet the damn cat subreddit. I don't even have a cat and I was feeling your parental guilt!
I don’t like cats...I like your cat.
Rauuul..
YOU NEED ANOTHER CAT SON

Edit: NVM SAW YOUR COMMENT THAT YOU HAVE TWO ALREADY CARRY ON
aw this baby :(
So crazy I had a boy cat that did the same thing. He would meow and walk around with a robe belt. It was his thing. I thought he was the only weirdo. Beautiful kitty.
Well this is sad.
This video really messed with my dog. The high pitch meows especially.
Awwww, poor baby misses you!
That was fucking heartbreaking
One of my cats saves this noise for his Puke Alarm. 

He rarely gets hairballs and flat out panics when one is coming up. First you hear the woeful crying, then the puke sprinkler happens. (He runs around crazily mid-vom as a fun bonus.)
When you finally come back: 

Cat: "Oh, is that you? I didn't notice."
Reading the comments I am clearly misunderstanding what this cat is trying to tell its humans...  from best I can tell the cat is clearly saying  


>I'm gonna hang you. Tonight. While you sleep. With this rope. Right here.
Awwww the poor baby. I think your kitty is lonely. Have you thought about getting a friend for her?  That’s how I ended up with 2 cats- I got 1, and she would get lonely and cried when I was gone.

Getting another cat was a huge adjustment, particularly because I made a choice that I hoped would be in both our best interest’s (adopting a kitten- I was hoping she would feel less threatened and more maternal toward a young cat). 

We had some major jealousy and dominance issues from my existing cat, but after a slow and patient positive introduction period, and a rather chaotic adjustment period, it mostly had the effect I wanted!

Which is, now my baby girl isn’t quite as lonely when I have to go! She still likes me best- the other cat is certainly a “last resort”, haha. But she will cozy up to the other cat if she needs some extra affection that I can’t give her at the time, because I’m sick/busy/gone.
Time to get another cat for companionship. I recorded my cat one day and he sat by the door meowing for 30 mins after I left. After adopting another cat he’s totally fine
It looks like she “caught” the leash and she is making that “notice how I caught the prey sound”. My cat “cries” when she catches her little toy mice.
Butters just woke up from his nap and tried to take the phone from me when he heard this.
Show us when you came home!!
Time to get him a friend.
Cats are assholes like that though, playing on your emotions. Mine would make that exact sound, like she was lonely, but she knew I was home! One time she even followed me into the toilet then wandered off down the hallway and started crying like I was the one that abandoned her!
My cats were very concerned about your kitty.  After discussion we decided you need more kitties
I’m not the only one who heard hello? And mama? Right?
I played that on my headphones and my girlfriend flew out of her chair screaming in joy that our missing cat came back home.
She kept looking up. She was looking for a place to hang herself.

I know a little bit about these things.
Mine meows that way to tell me he brought me something. It's his song of how proud he is of himself 💕
When we leave we’ll see where our cats are (asleep on our bed) and no matter how long we’ve been gone they’re almost always in the same spot unbothered lmao
omg you get your ass home and play the string game with kitty pronto!!
This is me during quarantine
Holy fucking shit. I thought my cat was the only one that does this! Drags a ribbon from one room to the next when I'm in bed at night, just before turning the lights off. Then he'll either grab the end and drag it back out, or go to the other room and drag an additional ribbon in.

Can't open his mouth all the way, or the ribbon drops. That's why it sounds like that. Oh, and he drags the ribbon in between his back feet, so it looks like he's booty-scooting around everywhere. lol
It’s like “I’m so sad...I must grab the string though...” “oh I’m so sad! Wait I need my string...okay yes I’m so sad”
Paranormal Cativity
"TAKE ME WITH YOUUU! Here's my leash...." 😿
My cat took a green string out of my pajama pants and carries it around and, I swear to God, looks so much like your cat with his string.
Omg you are never allowed to leave again!!
I’m dealing with pre menstrual syndrome and this made me cry so hard I love him
Jesus fucking Christ OP get your cat a pal. For the love of god please. He needs a friend.
All these cats giving this cat support ❤️
Translation: “I know you’re taking video of me and I’m going to act traumatized to make you feel bad. I hope this is working...”
I played the video out loud for my and he seemed very concerned. Now I feel like adopting another cat so he wont feel lonely.
Ours makes the same sounds - if he forgets where we are (he's 18 now) or if he's looking for his sister who passed away last year.  In both cases scritches prove to be a good solution.
aww looks like your kitty needs another cat friend (when it's safe of course to adopt one) right now just stay at home and pet that baby <3
You should get your cat a cat
We have a cat that does this when she brings you "prey". She finds a small toy or stuffed animal and meows like that while dragging it all over the house until you acknowledge her. Then she drops it and sets off to find another.
My cat came over and starting loving up my phone with head bumps at this.
Omg just break my heart why don’t you?!
SOMEBODY GET THIS CAT A WALK I DON’T CARE HOW MUCH IT TAKES
I did this once with my dog. She cried a lot. I cried when I saw the footage. She’s been living quarantine though
My cat will walk around the house with a string in his mouth howling just like this. Not sure why he does it.
Oh my god cats do love
Poor baby :(
I played this out loud and my dog came up and put his paw on my chest and stared at the phone with such concern :( head tilt and all, i don’t know if he can just understand or??
Oh poor thing :( 
My cat used to drag around a shoestring and cry like that too.
[deleted]
bored out of her mind.
That's why you got to get em another cat. Always have 2, so they're not alone when you leave.
I AM SO DEPRESSED
Ahh poor baby. That’s why I always have multiple animals so they can keep each other company too. If I can afford another mouth to feed why not.

Edit: not telling anyone to get more pets, that’s just my philosophy.
CatS aRe EviL anD tHeY DoNt CaRe AbOut ThEiR oWneRs
My cat does the exact same thing with her leash.

The only difference is that it’s if we’re in a different room. Not gone.
This is the ultimate pre- r/MasterReturns
I've watched this wayyyyyy too many times.
Oh my god one of mine used to do this, except it was usually at like 3 AM. He'd wander around with his ball crying until someone got out of bed and threw it for him. 

You were the goodest boy, Dizzy.
No i'm not crying... you are..
I did this because my cat was always meowing at the door when I got home and I felt bad. Found out he could care less and sleeps all day, he just goes to the door when he hears the garage. Coincidently the treats are also by that door, he definitly played me.
We used to call that the "where ARE you?!" Meow. Baby girl would do it if she woke up alone, forgot people went upstairs to bed, or if she was looking for someone who wasn't home. I miss that dumbass.
That’s why I keep three cats.
They’ll never get bored fighting each other.
It didn’t show you coming home, petting him for 10 seconds and then he bit you!
Poor cat, forgot to take its human out for a walk and is now worried the human ran away...
My cat was obsessed with me and followed me everywhere. Slept on my lap at all times and laid on my shoulders for hours. Then I moved out, overseas, and never saw it again.. it died shortly after. I’m starting to think there is a correlation. I miss that cat a lot, I cried when I heard it died.
I learned my cats also do this when they think noone is home. I always meow back and they zoom over to where I am.
I love Siamese! They just talk and howl for no reason, beautiful flame point boy.
"hello????hello??????? HELLOOOO?"
I feel like it definitely knew it was on camera and made a very dramatic show.

Edit: After seeing the comment of having another senior cat in the house, I'm now conflicted between it putting on a show and missing its friend. :(
How are you gonna sit her and post this without posting the part where you come home and the cat is happy?????
The cat goes from “Hello? Helloooooooo?” to a bird when the video speeds up and it’s hilarious
My cat NEVER reacts to cats meowing on videos, yours got a rather strong reaction. Whatever your fluff is saying must be very concerning.
Harro harro!
My 12-year-old cat yowls like this when she catches a  foam ball in the wilds of our living room.
My cat makes the same noise while carrying around string. She used to do it when we were in another room and she thought no one could see her. We were concerned and after some googling learned this is just some thing cats do sometimes. They arent sad, just excited.

Since then our cat has gotten braver about letting her freak flag fly and will do it while we are around. She does it way more though when us and the other pets are in a room and she has the place to herself.
Omg the way it dragged the lead around tho
My cat makes that noise when he leaves the room where I freaking was. I have to call him to me and rub his big head to calm him down.
What the heck did your cat say? My cat woke up, looked around her all worried and ran away.
My cat pisses on the kitchen counter if I’m gone for too long...
Thanks, now my cat is panicking.
Okay, if you dont show me a video of you taking that cat for a walk, I will never forgive you.
When I first got my little babe, my roommate told me she would sit and stare at the door for literally nine hours while I was at work until I got home...we got another cat.
My cat does this when she captures a scrunchie. I call it her victory cry.
Helloooo? Hellooooo? Helloo^oooo?
Awwww, my cat does the same exact thing when she thinks she's been left alone! She has this little furry tassled wand from when we first adopted her, and it must be a comfort toy for her because she doesn't play with it and drags it around all over (I'm always finding it in weird places). 

A few mornings when I've slept in and my SO has gone to work, I just hear these muffled yowls and this little plastic wand with bell dragging along the floor. As soon as I call out to her, she drops her wand and hurries over to me! I've also heard her do it when I'm downstairs hanging up the laundry.
I played that video out loud and my cat got crazy and started to look everywhere, like he was trying to save the cat howling like that, IDK what it means but my cat knew
No lie, my cat does the same vocals after “killing” her string toy. Has done since she was a babe. We just holler at her that we’re in bed(or wherever, but it’s usually late at night) and she brings us her “kill”
Aww he misses you!
“ HUMMMmAAaANnNnNnNnNn!!! HummmaaNNNNN!

Serve me my kibbles ! HELllLLooOo !???
My cat does the same thing with our socks. Almost every night, she’ll leave them by our bedroom door and I always thank her and love on her.
Damn that's one beautyfull cat .
Fuck you..its just to cute and you left him. So 

Fuck you
Should post this in r/catsthatyell
Feels bad man
That’s the saddest/cutest thing. 


Also, your neighbors hate you
Awww

And btw what is that black cord that the cat is biting?
Do you...walk your cat?

That looks like a leash.
My cat does this when she wants to play. She comes crying over to me with a ball in her mouth to play fetch.
He needs a kitty friend
My kitten would like to know if your cats okay. She was very concerned
HELLO? heLLO? HELLO?
? What is wrong?
I thought a mouse was responding to your cat when it got all squeaky spedup.
Make kitty happy again
I’m heartbroken *crying* and that’s saying a lot... I don’t have a heart
Is she wanting to go for a walk?  Is that a leash?
my cat does that when i’m home and with another cat living with us
I recently had to put down a beautiful cat with white fur that looks just like your cat! It brought back some amazing, and sad memories seeing this video. I still wish he was still here with me through this tough time. Gone but never forgotten! I hope your beautiful kitty lives an amazing life! 
RIP Snowflake ❤️
Flame point Siamese?
My cat makes this noise when she’s upstairs, I’m downstairs and it’s bedtime (right around 10pm.)

She stand up there and just howls until I come up...
My little shithead used to climb the roof of my old house when I was in high-school every single day. I’d come home to her wailing at the sun and when I would get onto the lawn shed see me and wail at me until I got the ladder and got on the roof. As soon as I got onto the roof she would stop, look at me, and roll around on the roof and make me pet her belly. This was an every day routine.
Your cat needs a friend
Two years ago my mom (wich I live with) had to keep my sister's cat for something like two week, he never gave a damn about me but I wase ok with that as I don't really like cat. One day my brother and mother left for groceries I think and the cat thought that no one wase left in the house as I wase in my bedroom, then I heard the worst thing I ever heard, he started to cry, a lot ! 
It lasted 5 minute then I screamed "I'm here buddy" he stopped came see me at my door for five seconds and left, a cat cry is really heartbreaking
I liked the part where the cat when chirp chirp.
Poor kitty. A brother or a sister may help. This is why I always have at least 2 pets so they can keep each other company
Aw, poor thing! One of mine does this if she's asleep and doesn't see me go upstairs for bed.
They are only part of our lives. But we are all of theirs :(
Do you walk your cat? Is that a leash it's carrying?
I have a flamepoint siamese that looks so similar! Her name is Monroe and she is also clingy, it seems to be a thing with Flamepoints maybe? Monroe sleeps right outside my bedroom door and my husband says when I leave she meows and cries at the door a lot.
My cat was greatly disturbed by whatever this cat was saying. He's currently sitting up wondering wtf is going on
Excuse me OP, but what is it eating?
This is why I looked into kitty daycare for my cat but realised it's not a thing.
I watched with volume off and was tickled thinking the cat was up to shenanigans. Shared and was told it was sad and was like WTF? Then rewatched with sound. Okay, that explains the title and comments, and now I have guilt for giggling.
Cats are not supposed to be stuck in a 500sq ft space all their lives
And yet people get cats on purpose so they can have an animal they can leave alone for days.
People are monsters and the entire pet industry is an abomination.
My cat died matted and depressed, I had her when I was 12 and she grew from skittish get away from me type of cat, to I need to sleep on your lap type of cat.

She made this sound every day at my parents and especially when she heard me buzz their apartment to come up, you could hear her down the hall. Then I came inside, she would ahut up, and follow me everywhere until I left, and as I left she would start screaming like this again.

I loved her so much and she was one of my last connections to my childhood, I legitimately loved her like family. She died with me not around, she was constantly matted all the time ever since I moved away, my parents were poor all my life and so was I, I should have let her live with me but I thought I had more time. I didn't. I'm bawling my eyes out right now for the first time since she passed and I buried her.

My mom is veey very high risk to covid19 with her copd, very bad heart, overweight, and hypertension as well as being 66.

I'm about to lose everything I loved shortly but at least there's a chance I don't, thank you trudeau for trying to save my family even if so many hate you. Thank you for valuing our seniors.

I'm sorry to get political but I'm in so much pain and haven't been able to let it out in so long, I'm so fucking sorry I let you down gizmo, 15 years and I let you die alone and depressed. 

If my cats last act was to show how much pain regret can bring, I love you even more, because I know as afraid as I've been to call and talk to my mom these past years, the pain I'll live with forever after will be so much worse.

I fucking love you gizmo and I'm sorry.
Needs friend!
Its sounds like it is saying, "Hello.... Hello.... Hello???" 
Awwww.... 😢
Time to get your cat a cat.
I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but that kitty needs a kitty.
I’m pretty sure he’s trying to tie that into a noose.... 🤯
I’m not crying, YOU’RE CRYING
u/vredditdownloader
Aaaaaand this is why I don’t like it when people propagate the idea that cats can just be left alone for a weekend or are super hands off. They have as much emotional and social needs as dogs.
Oh no!! I wanted to see when you got home and the cat was super excited!
Oh my god!!!!! That’s the saddest thing ever!!
This is sadder than every Pixar film... put together.
This is why I got a second cat. Even if the first hates the second, it’s less miserable for them than feeling lonely and abandoned.
The cat seriously wants to go for a walk.
Should get a second cat so they can keep each other company when your not around lol.
My cat also makes that noise and I also hate it.
is he just dragging the leash around the house?
I can't bear it!
I didnt have sound on the first time i watched this and i was really confused lol
Holy wow, we have the same type of cat! Flame point balinese are great :)
Nice Kitchen!
very good, hehehe.
Anyone else see this with new perspective now that we are experiencing social distancing? I want to free me indoor only kitty - but that wouldn't work in favor of his longevity.
I really want a cat now
*hellohellloooohelloooo* poor kitty just wants it’s master
Stackars katt💔
You should think about getting another cat
You need to get them a friend.
Is that a leash he's carrying around?
I have a flame point as well, and he makes this same exact noise when he is looking for one of his two cat besties to play with.
Oh my heart. That poor baby misses you so much 😭
Poor baby :’(
What kind of camera did you use? I would like to put to watch my babies.
My cat does this the moment everyone is tucked in bed. It’s like he’s finally got privacy he wants to suck on his blankie. 

Since I’ve started work from home he’ll occasionally do it during the day when I’m in the basement and he’s on the main floor. If he hears me coming up the stairs he’ll stop.
My girl will drag my socks around and howl when I leave. Even with other people/cats around she will just start up eventually. Love her dearly.
My cat does this every night at the same time. Usually between 9 and 10. She run around with her ball in her mouth moewing untill someone plays fetch with her.
OH NO 😭
That cat is my cat’s cat twin.
Poor baby.
My calico does this too, but with her toys
My cat walks around with her little toy crying "hellooooo" too.
My cat does this too and with the same type of meow (more loud yelling too). Ones he didn't knew i was home , since i was in my bed very quiet in the morning. He kept meowing through the whole house.  Looking if someone is home. He was happy to realise i was home. 

I think it is a: where are you kinda meow. I heard and saw my cats friends and my cat also doing it outside to call to eachother
Awe he must be a lover? Do you take him on walks? Or does he just like that shoe lace?
My dog was looking for it.
My cat does this every morning. He waits until I'm running our daily standup call, drags his cat dancer over and starts throwing a tantrum.
You have a dog in a cat body
Oh, poor baby
OMG that's heartbreaking :(
My soul feels so.. sad.
HEART BEOKEN !!!!
Yeah...that's a lonely cat... You're gonna need to get another or be with this one more.
My cats drag strings around howling like that too, even when I'm home. Weirdos
My cat does the same thing around midnight, meowing with toy in his mouth- whyyyyyy???!
I fell very bad for leaving my cat sometimes
Sounds like he's saying "hello??"
“hello”
I'd be worried about your cat swallowing the cord.
Sounds like my boyfriend’s cat. He and I are long long distance, and sometimes when we video chat, he’ll leave to take the garbage out, but put his phone on the ground by the front door. His cat meows like this until he comes back inside
I'm so glad my cat isnt the only one that moans like this
That cat is legit saying hello over and over again 😂😂😂
Poor cat looks bored... get toys!
Is this normal? I'm curious if my cat would do this when I'm not there, and I can't ask him cause right now he's snoring on my bed behind me.
I agree. You can never ever leave again ever. He was so sad.
My friend's cat whom we're looking after does this when we are out of sight
I hope his name is floof ‘the floofiest cat of them all’
My dog came in like ‘???? Are you OKAY?’
/u/vredditshare
We left our car alone overnight a few times. He didn't eat, drink or use his litter while we were away. We won't leave him overnight again.
Anyone else think that it was chasing a bird?
Is this worth putting my headphones on? Nah
I would hate to be your neighbor
I am not a cat person and I generally am very offput by them but my heart is in fragments
My one cat does this when she's trying to find me to bring her toy mouse to me.   She's a bit handicapped and will lose you in the apartment
Don't you ever leave him alone again !!
Is that the cat’s leash? Mine hate leashes lol
Some serious separation anxiety, dawwwwwww! 
*tear*
So your cat is a dog?
My cat sounds exactly like this one lol
:(
Hey but now you have a great reason to get another cat!
"Yo dude, I've got this awesome present for you if you come back. Come look at it!"

My cat used to do this if it got too quiet or we were out. She used to carry around a ball of string and you could see the path she'd taken as it was wound around all the table legs and ceremoniously dumped in front of the door. You'd usually find a few different things that she'd stolen.

She still does it, but without the object,  just the noise.
Is that the cats leash?
You've got yourself a cat-dog - the best of both worlds
Awe that's so sad
My cat makes the same sound when she thinks we are all gone (and I assume when we are actually all gone). All I have to do is say something to let her know we are here and she stops.  Its sweet and sad at the same time.
My cat’s string is white, but that’s the key difference of what my camera will catch when I walk the dog.
Even when I'm home, mine just sleeps in my bed. She seems fine
I now know that a fast forwarded cat meowing sounds like a mouse squeaking.
r/Catswhoyell
Oh. My cat just sleeps when we’re gone.
Guinea pigs are unmoved by the plight of the lonely kitty...
Man being a cat would be pretty great, sitting down looks so comfortable
“This jerk setup a camera to record me. I gonna fuck with ‘em because, well I’m a cat that’s what we do.”
YOU MONSTER
Are you in northern Europe? I miss having a double door.
Do you...walk your cat?
My two woke up from their catnaps as soon as they heard your kitty. My adult cat came to check out the phone and then went searching for your kitty. My 8 month old kitten just popped his head up and then went back to sleep once I turned the sound off.
This is why when I get a cat I'm getting two.
My cat makes this exact same noise when we leave and have the camera on. Such the same noise that my husband thought I was watching an old video of our cat.
Since I have two cats, they’re never lonely. Lol
Do you walk your cat on a leash?
Poor kitty.
I think it wants to go for a walk
My husband was listening to "Sorry seems to be the hardest word" while I was watching this and the video got even more sadder, poor kitty!
You get back home right meow, you monster!!
You can leave, you just have to bring kitty along!
I don't like watching it. It makes me feel like a bad person
Honestly those are what my days are like now
Omg that makes me wanna cry
Like he's looking for a way to hang himself
u/vredditdownloader
This is exactly what my cat does at 3am, shortly before her screaming sprint down the hallway
Oh, my heart!
What a beautiful cat!
Please get another kitty for him or a puppy.
My cat just came in to see what was wrong, he normally ignores cats on video.
Oh Lord that is the most pitiful cry I’ve ever heard...Except the one from one of my cats when we are five minutes late with lunch
Awe that string is the cats “teddy bear” my cat does the same thing with his favorite toy!
My cats were very interested in the sound coming out of this video
You can never leave ***without your cat*** again. They even brought their leash ): . If you get a doctors note for a emotional support animal, some jobs and businesses allow you to bring pets inside, and some jobs you can negotiate with. Just discuss with your employer and call ahead to local businesses you frequent / plan to go to beforehand to check if they allow/would allow your cat to come with you!

 *Side note:* this made me so sad ): the sad meows ))))))):
Get another cat. That way they can scream sadness together.
Get it a feline friend.
r/catswhoyell
Some cats pine after their recently departed owners. My mom's cat? That vindictive feline used to get so offended by any of her humans leaving, she'd get retribution for her hurt feelings through urinary release on the most favored of the family's furnishings.
My cat does this when she carries around a sock or plastic bag. I always thought she was calling her ‘pack’ in to show them what she ‘captured’. Edit: I have 2 cats. Sometimes my other cat will come and see what she is crying about. But most of the time they ignore each other.
omg this is so cute!!
That cat was saying “Hello?” And I refuse to think otherwise
Mine is alright if I leave. But if me or my partner are in the house and in different rooms he does this super sad meow. So we have to stay together or Atleast let him know where each other are
How could you abandon such a creature for 30mins!? Have you no shame human?
My cat did this! He'd carry around his favourite toy (a little stuffed frog that he thought was his baby) and cry. Usually when we were being quiet...  We'd just shout out that we were still home and he'd come running. Then when he saw us, he'd drop the frog, stalk away, and pretend that it didn't happen.
\[TRANSCRIPT\]

"What is this robot eyeball doing here?"

"Human? Human? Both of us know i'm not allowed to go on a walk alone, or know how to open the front door for that matter..."

"Hello? This isn't funny! I guess i'll just sit here until you come back. HELLO?"

"Come along mister ropey, we're looking for the human!"

"Are you in the den of of the vacuum beast? No?"

"This is agonizing, they've been gone for... 20 minutes! That's like a million minutes in cat years! Though admittedly I don't know any math."
Could you record a video of you returning and getting your cats reaction?
I often wonder what my cat does. I know when I walk out of the house into the garden room he meows like crazy.
Definitely what we call yowling, usually a Sign of distress, brother kitty being away will have made the loneliness worse! It's a very distinctive sound. Mind you one of ours woke me at 4am.the other day yowling, and when I got up to see what had happened, she had brought her pooky toy upstairs and just seemed to want to play
 Bloody cats.  My old cat used to climb up my loft stairs and when I came home, it's have to go find her and bring her down the ladder. She'd just sit and yowl with that haunting noise until I found her 😺
Well now you have an excuse not to leave
That cat misses you so much. Or, your cat is a wonderful actor and needs his/her own series on Netflix.
Chill guys. It means they're loved.
My cat was asleep in the same room and when your cat started meowing he jumped up to the window and started looking outside
Poor baby! My cats all came to see what was wrong.
Omg this is so sad
He needs a friend!!!!!! Get him a furry friend!
Get another cat!
The meows of eternal loneliness! :'(
My favorite part is the meow into the closet because maybe everyone is hiding in there.
Pooooor baby!! You could put a video of your voice or something on a TV so he can hear it while you're gone? 🤔
Is that a Flame Point?  Looks and sounds just like my Flame Point.
They recommend having some form of clear "I'm leaving for a bit" with your cat, so they don't spend the time looking for you. Do basically the same thing with them every time before you leave. It should help.  
Also give it a stuffed animal, especially if it smells a bit like you
looks like you need another cat
Ae poor little sweetie puff
My heart broke. Your baby needs a friend. Please give your little one lots of cuddles for me to fix my heart 💖
Aweeee oh no, no u cannot ever leave that poor thing alone ever!😘❤️
Oh no, one of my boys does this too and drags either my wife’s blanket around and suckles it or some of our clothes. Crybabies.
One of my cats makes the exact same meows and carries around a long thin fluffy toy in her mouth that looks a lot like this! She’ll also do it when we go up to bed, even though she’s allowed in our room. She’ll just cry downstairs until we call her up.
Candid catmera.
Really crying too😢😢😢
HELLO? HELLO? HELLO?
This made my two hound dogs go absolutely insane. Very cute. 10/10 would not watch again; they're still howling haha
Creepy but I could tell immediately this was an apartment in Sweden. Even before seeing the Karlstad frame. Something about the door divider on the floor between the kitchen and the hallway, as well as the front door.
You're going to have to quit your job!
/u/vredditdownloader
I sometimes forget I own a cat. During the day she just sleeps somewhere in the house, getting active at dawn and after she's fed she just disappears for most parts of the night.  
I suppose I'm really just the can opener...
Our girl does that, drags around a similar looking toy,  basically a string ribbon with a plastic handle. She doesn't seem unhappy, if you "confront" she'll generally drop the toy,  respond with a happy sounding chirp and do a leg rub.
I wish it would have shown the reunion!
Poor punkin
What's he dragging around? I know my cat sleeps or watches birds when I'm not home
If you don't go go home, I'm kicking that fucking door in.
Get your cat a cat.

That's what we did and we've never looked back.
My cat bawls like a baby if I come home and leave for just a bit. People say cats don’t have loyalty/affection/connection with their humans but it’s so not true.. :(
Aww a flamepoint siemese...these cry babies are famous for this type of thing.
Start leaving a great puzzle, or one of those cat toy enrichment toys. Put cat nip in it if they enjoy it. Do that when you leave and practice leaving them alone several times a day for awhile. Hopefully it helps.
Poor baby
This makes me miss my cat so much :( I can't wait until I can go home
My cat does this consistently and she will never actually bring us the string... Sometimes she starts doing this at like 3 am...
My cat is still looking for the crying cat.
Omg, you make me cry 💔
My cat sounds like this when he’s yelling at his water bowl
My cat does this is she has her favorite toy. She stares at it and howls...
Plot twist: she actually knew you left the camera on, so she Made the show on purpose 

*the cat is adorable, had to share it
Man this is hard to watch
r/catswhoyell
What's up with the leash?  Do you walk your cat?
Both of my kitties appeared out of nowhere, with concerned looks, after clicking this.
HELLO??
Does that cat want walkies?
Here I am thinking, huh, a cat drags a piece of string, what is aww about that? Then all the comments say I should have played it with sound :D
Sad, lonely kitty needs a buddy! Fortunately, kitten season is upon us and there are heaps of older kitties in shelters - go find a foster and see if they can become buddies!
That's exactly what my Miki sounds like either at night or when he sees my family members leave him alone to roam the house.
Turkish Van? My friend had one, it would go swimming in the bath and run around the house wet.
your kitty needs another kitty friend. adopt another one so they can play together
Give him love!
Awww poor baby.
Oh my heart! 💔
Why does your cat have a lead?
awe poor buddy. I had a cat that did that, but then he ignored me when I was around.
My cats and dog were very concerned for your cat. They were searching all over for source of the meowing! Roscoe is still searching. Lol
This video needed to end with you coming home. I need to see this cat happy. 😿
Poor fella
After one of my pair passed away, I heard my lone kitty crying like this after leaving for work one morning.  I found her a buddy the next weekend
My cat's voice sounds almost exactly like this one's! :0
The best thing you can do for your cat is to bring in your home a kitten.
My cat was alone for three years and he was very grumpy all the time and often irritated and even aggressive towards me. That all changed when I brought in another cat. It took them a few days to become friends, and after that my cat changed completely. He is now a very calm and loving cat. I can see that he is much much happier now
My cat does this with her string while I'm still home. I come to play with her and she's all "never mind".
Is that his comfort string?
