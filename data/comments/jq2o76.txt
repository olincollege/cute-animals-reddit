Well that’s a happy stretch if I’ve ever seen one!
Thats some quality suction cups(is that the name)

Like most the ones I've seen come off with hardly and weight.

Edit:  I've been told they are K&H brand and seems accurate so to those wondering there ya go!
Damn I thought he was levitating for a second
Jealous of the hammock
His coloring is beautiful.
I love it when kitties wake up and stretch their little toe beans like that.
"Here are my BEEEANS!"
I'm actually pretty impressed with that view you have. Looks really nice
Toe beans!
Bengals are the stretchiest cats. They'll just stretch and stretch and roll over and stretch and move somewhere else and stretch.
Damn if I know anything about suction cups those things will give out at 3am dropping all your shampoo and bodywash onto the floor of the shower waking up half the family.
For a second I thought the cat was fuckin levitating
what a precious and handsome little boy ☺️
I love when they extend the paws for the rings to be kissed
r/straightenedfeetsies and r/murdermittens would like a word.
Thought it was floating for a sec
Where did u get this bed?  And can it hold like 15 pounds of a cat

Those toes!!!
So have you got me my favourite food human slave?
Beautiful animal
Kitty, you need a bunk mate!!! Move over PLEASE???🐾😻🐾
I felt the need to stretch after that lol
Brought to you by the suction cups from Mission Impossible.
At first I thought “Wow I have to get one of these for my pet!”

Then I remembered my pet is a 70 pound dog lol
I've never been so envious of a cat before.
That's a beautiful cat
Belly spots!!!
Hammock link please!!
I love when animals look at you and stretch. They know we like it
what in the world this cat is so cute 💕
Cats are just beautiful little killing machines
I just wanna know how is bed is floating and then I can admire his handsomeness
Living MY best life too! Jelly
🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🙂🙂cute!!!
What kind of cat is that? Really beautiful
Tooooeeesssss
That thing is beautiful
Awww hahaha 🥰
HE LEVITATIN’
What a cute little baby! 🥰
I love it when cats get that stretch, even stretching their paws, toes, and claws. It's so cute and looks so satisfying. Wish I could stretch like that.
What a pretty kittyyy
I love how people have so much trust in those!
OMG he's absolutely gorgeous!!
What a gorgeous cat!
At first I thought the cat was floating until I saw that from afar the thing it was sleeping on made it look like they both were the same(what am I saying)
Am I the only one who though the cat was floating?
I like when he stretched out his lil toes 😍
Yikes, I feel like his little kitty hammock is about to fall.
Happiest stretch for the win. 

Beautiful little kitty. ♥️😺
Beautiful kitty. Looks very comfy and content.
Aww, adorable!
Pretty Kitty ❤
People who don't like cats just baffle me because cats are THE cutest animals in the world.
What a cutie<3
I thought the cat was floating for a sec
Shit this thing is showing up as $60 in Amazon
I wish to be reincarnated as a house cat.  That is all.
Not going to lie I thought the cat was floating in the air for a second there
r/PetTheDamnCat/
Yeah I'm gonna need a link to that quality suction cup cat bed
I thought this mans was floating lmao
Its a flying fucking cat
For a split second I thought the cat was floating or the camera was at an odd angle but NOPE!  XD
Thought the little cutie was floating at first. Loved the little hello paw stretch too!
I thought "Matrix* kitty!" But then the angle changed. I would love to get one for my cat though.
If every animal could be this well cared for, loved and happy, I’d give everything I had for the rest of my life. 

Those stretchy toes!
He looks like hes levitating. So cute!
Thought he was flowing
I seriously thought this to be a magic trick
Lol I thought it was floating at first
My drunk ass thought that the cat bed was floating...
Thought I was on /r/blackmagicfuckery for a moment there
TIL cat eyes are the same as snakes
Looked to me like he was levitating at first!
Suspended cat makes me jealous - a little
Okay. To be honest, for a second there, I thought he was floating.
Who else said “biiiiig stretch” while watching this?
WHERE IS THE LINK FOR THESE OMFG I NEED ONE FOR MY KITTIES D:
Mini Tiger
Fancy gato
He deserves it
My cats always sit in the windowsills in my house so they would love this
Fabulous!  And full stretch with toe spread.  Purrfect
What brand is that hammock? I bought one a while ago, one recommended by a lot of people. It only stayed on the window for about 3 months now it refuses to go back up lol
r/INEEEEDIT
They just do what their body tells them to do. I love it.
That toe stretch ❤️
He is adorable 😍
He will love it up until the suction cups fail
If they made an industrial size one for my chonkyboi I'd get it ASAP
This is one of the cutest things I have ever seen.
i wish i was as relaxed as that cat
DEM FEETZ
Now only does this cat look perfectly content but he is handsome as all get out.
Dude where did you get this!
Zero fucks given. Evidenced by that toe stretch.
Kawaaii
I lost my Bengal four years ago to FATE, and this one looks so much like mine. It hurts so much still to this day, probably more than any other loss in my life
Cats half lid their eyes and slow blink to say "I trust and am comfortable around you", which is the cat equivelant to "I love you".
Toes stretched out.
Gato baiano do krl
That’s adorable but I’d never trust suction cups that much.
What a handsome boy!
What is this and where do I get one? 

Looking for two: one for my cat and one for me.
Touch the beans!
I need more cat trees in my place. Curious tho, I ordered one from eBay a bit ago. Tall, nice, spacious but my cat doesn’t use it anymore aside from scratching. Is that normal?
I am so unbelievably jealous of this cats life, its not even funny
Lowkey thought the cat was gonna fall off
I'm jealous! You're more than relax than me.
That is a beautiful cat, what breed is it?
Beautiful boy😻
THOSE LITTLE BEANS!!!

r/murdermittens
super cuuuuute!
I like cats, but I've met too many bitch ass cats that just like to hide behind furniture and scratch people as they walk by to think they're all as good as dogs.  I hate to say it because a lot of dogs have been mistreated under the same logic, but some breeds of cat seem to not be geared towards being pets
Oh my gosh that window seat is the best!
I'm more of a dog person but what a gorgeous looking cat! He has beautiful markings. Cheeky boy 🐾
That's too cute
now give him a kiss on the top of his head🥺
r/spreadytoes
r/petthedamncat
One day those suction cups will just drop. They always do.
Pretty cat though
Ahh damn that’s cute! I wanna get one for my boy too now
Happy cat!
Magic?
The bestest life
I think he actually fell asleep again there after you walked up on him haha.  That’s the life I want to live..
Hshshdh q amor
Why do I want a cat now?
Those beans!
Clean glass my guy
/u/vredditshare
That's one content kitty ☺️
Is his name Beerus?
Ah I miss the days when I could relax like that
This is the cat equivalent of a powerball win.
That's really cool.  One of mine  in particular woulda loved that.

Gorgeous kitty.
Covid has turned us all into this cat. Human form.
Those beans
Who disturbs my slumber?
this cat lives a better life than I do...
Looks comfy, i want a hammock

Those suction cups are legit! 

I got a caddy for my shower to carry a single bar of soap and never would stick.
OMG! When that started I was so freaked out! I thought he was on a railing and was going to fall!
Whew! I can catch my breath now.
Can I be your cat as well?
My cat has that same one and loves it
How did it even get up there?!
I want a hammock like that :c

My cat has a window hammock too!

He’s a bengal and getting fat so he can’t gain more weight or else it’ll fall off
LOL & WOW!!! We have a hanging porch ornament that looks just like that. Cool to see it irl.
Happy kitty.
Toe beans

Honestly my dumb ass thought that cat was floating.
But if I want to spend my life chillin I'm "weird, lazy, don't have a life."
I love cats I don’t what it is.
Is that a bengal?
I aspire to reach this level of unbothered
u/savethisvideo
suction cups have always failed on me, i hope it doesnt fail this cat during deep sleep, it would be awful.
Good morning, king.
Beans!
That cat probably cost more than my car.
Omg! The stretchy toe beans 😻
Strechy toe beans
I just LOVE those stretches!!!

I genuinely never thought I’d cross my mind but fuck I’m jealous! Never thought I’d be jealous if a cat!
Cute
The spread beans of the landed gentry!!! 😻
Ooh, big stretch.

u/wildraven
Lol that’s so cute!!
I thought the cat was floating at first :)
So is the owner, nice digs
I'd risk my arms to scratch that belly
I wanna be that cat.
It’s weird to say, but his face looks so sophisticated. Almost wise in a sense.
Living di life
😍🤗
Someone tell me I’m not crazy for thinking he was fully just levitating at the beginning?
These are the chillest vibes ever
Wow that was a stretch-
What a cool cat.
Amazing lifestyle
I want to rub the belly so bad
Well he is truely in good mood
This is exactly what I needed to wake up to. Those little toe bean stretches brought back happy memories of my cats.
That look like a giant disembodied unfurling hand at first to anyone else or am I just stoned?
Gorgeous kitty
Just a cat living the life, I wanna live xD
That is one cozy cat
He is stunning!
Pretty kitty with interesting coat!! 🥰❤️😍

What breed?
You got some very clean windows man, 10/10
When we walked up I legit thought he was floating
I thought the cat was floating at fitst
You may approach Human
I just want to tickle his pinkies.
His vibe is unbreakable
Good morning kitty!
My smooth brain thought that cat was floating at first
For a second there I thought that cat was hovering.
I have a strong urge to scratch that belly
Dude, what kind of cat is that??
The only thing I could imagine was the suction cups failing and him falling down to the sadness below
How often do the suction cups fail on these thing?
Big toe stretch
I thought for a sec he was floating
What a nap!
Where can I buy this?
My dum dum brain thought he was floating in air and until the end of the video I was tryna figure out who was holding him up and how. I rewatched it and then realised. Yay I'm dumb.
Hi,pretty baby
Rub that belly 
!!!!!!!!
When you stretch after waking up but fall asleep cause your now extra comfy
What a beautiful kitteh!! Also, da peets wit toe beans
At first I didnt see the sleepy thingy and thought the cat was floating
Where can I buy one of those ?
Now that is one beautiful cat!
I aspire to be that cat.
Proper
Waiting for that suction cup to give out, it will happen!
Do you have a link to where I can get that cat bed
Am I the only one that thought the cat was just floating in the air for the first 3 seconds?
Pet him
I need such a thing for my cat 😍
What kind of magic is this
u/savethisvideo
I have only one question. 
WHERE TO BUY THIS THING
I remember my grandma used to tell me dont let cats and dogs sleep in its back its bad for them, is it true or its just like old folk tale something like that?
r/glasstableorwindow
Just so damn cute!!! 😸😻😸
I thought the cat was floating
What nice toes you have
I want to see the video when the suckers inevitable it comes off
That cat has a great view!
Is it only me or is that cat looking like it's glitching around in the air?
That cat lives way better than I do!!!
Where do you find the sky hammock?
Truly relaxed 🙂
Bruh I thought he was flying
Anyone know where to get one of those things they're lying in?
That's just fantastic!!
My stupid head thought that was a wizard cat
I wanted to hear the purrs!
Not to be dramatic, but I would die for this cat.
You just know that's gonna give the poor guy one hell of a shock when those sticky poppers inevitably come off the window...
Where'd you get that cat hammock from?
Were did you get that, I’m getting one for mine.
Love that for him
I have to keep my cat bed low because my cats fall put of it often. Especially Ava.
This is me waking up on the weekend being able to sleep in.
u/savethisvideo
We got our cats one and they won't use it.  Tried moving it to another window and no go.  Such a great idea too.
Wow he/she is beautiful
What kind of cat is that?
Beautiful kitty- what a nice spot to take a nap
My little 17 year old kitty- Smudge weighs 4 pounds. She is a black Himalayan and hates touching the floor during the day- but runs up snd down the stairs and all over the house at Night.
Do they make these for chonky cats? 😯
u/vredditshare
I wanna be so rich that my cat can live like this 🥺😅
That is one relaxed and happy kitty who feels very safe and content. Great job on being a kitty parent! It's always heart warming to be able to tell they've had an owner who really loves them!
Gorgeous cat
god morning
I thought he was floating
I thought he was floating for a second lmao
Just looking at him in that thing gives me the sensation of falling
The strength you have to not just grab those feets
Well now I Have seen everything, a cat in a hammock, a cat hammock! one cool cat
