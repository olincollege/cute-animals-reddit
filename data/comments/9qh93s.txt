They even built him a little platform, that is so adorable!
Neighbor of the year award right there!
We had a female rottweiler and she loved to play with the male rotti on the other side of the fence. Well they loved to hang out so much that after a few months of clawing the boy had put a hole in the fence. Our neighbor agreed that it was probably best to just make the hole more uniform and pad it a little so they didn't run the risk of splinters. They would share toys through the hole in the fence and even played hide and seek. Early in the morning one would shove their head through and whine until the other came out to play. 
Awww!! He‚Äôs been waiting for you!!! 
Without knowing anything about your neighbors, they seem like good people.
All of you are great neighbors but that dog is the bestest neighbor. 
It's a petting glory hole.
When I was kid my babysitter had a dog named buds, an old golden retriever who I pretty much spent every day of my life with for 7 years. I wasn't allowed to have a dog so I acted like he was mine. When I would go home he would often jump the back gate and run over to my house in the next neighborhood. I would sneak him sometimes until I got caught. So then I would sneak out to go play with him at my baby sitters.

My mom woke up at 6am one morning and I was gone... 6 years old and walked alone in Brooklyn to my babysitters backyard.
Who's a good neighbor? Who's a good neighbor?

Gotta ask, who‚Äôs idea was this and how did it come about ?
r/HumansBeingBros
Awwwww his face while he was waiting !!!!! ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞



* Ps: My comment literally went from 200 to 800 upvotes in an hour. 

* Thanks guy. Dogs are the best at bringing people together. Straight facts.
 
Awesome!  More people need to talk and be friendly with their neighbors!
Can someone tell me what kind of dog this is? 
I feel like I need to clear some things up!
1. I cant have a dog as I am renting and it's against my landlords rules.
2. Hes a bernese mountain dog cross great pyrenese- his name is Jake
3. I pet him all the time! My original video was a little longer, but I posted a new one where I am petting him.
4. This was the neighbors idea, they paid for the whole fence and cleared it with my landlords first.
The face of this dog when you look over just reminds me why dogs are such amazing animals. I‚Äôm going to pet my me now. Bye 
i am the dog - am waiting here

behind the garden wall,

my neighbor's home - i heard him near

i love him best of all!

my fam's the best - i love them so

this fren - no dog has he

i get to watch him come n go

he Always looks for me

good fences - they good neighbors make

i guess sometimes that's fair,

my famly - for this neighbor's sake

this dog's love wants to share

n so they built a window here

into his yard i see

i love when this neighbor appear -

to share his love with me 



I hooked up with a guy once who had a cut out for the neighbors cat. I posted about it a couple months ago on ask reddit. Here's the copy paste: 

>I went home with this guy from the bar once and we were doing that weird thing where both of us know why I'm there but no one wants to make the first move. So he was giving me a tour of his house, and I'm pretending I'm all into architecture and shit. He showed me the back yard and explained that he'd just installed this big privacy fence. While he's showing me this, an adorable cat comes bounding across the yard. He explained that it was his neighbors cat but it likes to come visit him, so he had the fence installer build a cut out in the fence so the cat could come over any time he wanted. Long story short, I think my ovaries may have literally exploded.
ITT: People that have never rented. 
There is case where you can't have dog? Why?
That was a lovely thing to do.
You have a wonderful neighbor!!!   Years ago I had elderly neighbors who would occasionally mention how often my dogs barked.  As a joke,  I bought them a sling shot and told them it was to stop my dogs from barking.   Well...it worked.  My neighbors used the sling shot to send treats over the fence every time my dogs barked.  Lol. 
omfg it's a glory hole for dog petting
It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood, a beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine? Could you be mine? 

&#x200B;

(Please, I like to pet dogs....)
I'm just irrationally angry at whoever won't let you get a dog.

Omfg my heart ‚ù§üò≠üò≠ he was already waiting on the platform. I love dogs so damn much.

This just made my day in a way you can never know. 

Thanks to OP and their neighbors. 
That‚Äôs kind of sad that you‚Äôre not allowed to have your own dog! But that‚Äôs awesome that your neighbor cared enough to cut a little window out of the fence so you could at least pet their dog once in a while. Man, why can‚Äôt more people be that cool?! üòé
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Dogs are great. I‚Äôve been coming home for lunch since my job site is so close. Every day I open the door my dog runs out and greats one of my workers who is really good with dogs. He stays with him all lunch from the time I open the door until we leave. Really kinda cool how dogs can sense that welcoming and pursue it. Awesome neighbors too for doing this not only for you but the dog. 
I have something similar in my yard. However it's more of a broken fence and the dog likes to bark at me.... well dogs as 3 of my neighbours have dogs and  2 like to bark at me... but only in the backyard and not the front

Great dogs but I wish I could pet them without losing a finger lol

Completely unrelated but ey, nice hands.
Our neighbor has a potbelly pig we'll bring into our yard to spend time with my two yorkies, they all get along fine. WE've been doing this for years!  the pitbull on the other side has to be content to just run along the fence chasing the pig... 
I‚Äôve heard of ‚Äújump scares‚Äù, but I‚Äôve never heard of ‚Äújump wholesomeness‚Äù
best neighbor ever!
This is so stinking cute. He looks so happy and ready for a head rub
When my husband and I were living abroad on two year work visas, our neighbours had two dogs that we were totally in love with.  We were dog crazy but since we were likely leaving after only two years we weren't about to get one, so we would borrow our neighbours' dogs all the time, dogsitting was more of a favour to us than to them.  They had a little window in their fence too, that connected with the cemetery behind our houses, so the dogs would just take themselves for a run around the cemetery at their leisure.  Man, I miss those old buddies.
r/humansbeingbros
THIS IS THE GREATEST THING! 
My neighbour threatened to kill my dog with a rake. 
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Why aren‚Äôt you allowed to have a doggo ?
Mother in law made a little door into our six foot tall fence so that Watson the giant brown poodle next door could come over. I would open the backdoor and there was Watson staring at me. 
You have the best neighbors, OP. 
You have the best neighbors I've ever heard of
This is too awesome...enjoy the doggness......

Good fences make good neighbors.
Without sounding like a creep on the interwebs, you should come to our place. We've 3 puppers who obviously love being petted. Also, your neighbors are good peeps. And doggo is cute! 
My neighbors blast music until 1am and act like I‚Äôm the bad guy when I tell them to quiet down.
You have awesome neighbors. He‚Äôs adorable 
Oh hi baby üíï 
Oh he's a good boy.
Not sure why but my first thought was it‚Äôs gonna be real sad the day he‚Äôs too old and grey to jump up there.

Fuck why am I so morbid? Why can‚Äôt I let myself be happy?
Those are some awesome neighbors. Get them something for the holidays (and the dog obviously).
In my case I can have pets but none of the rescue centers will even consider me because I don't have a garden. (I have a balcony though). 
GOOD BOI WINDOW!! I love it so much what a sweet thing to do
Ohh, all my feels! Your neighbours deserve great, great things!
My dog passed away a while back and I haven't been able to get another dog due to the house I'm living in. My neighbours, who I absolutely love to pieces, got a puppy a year and a half ago. We have a small fence that borders our two properties, and the side door on my house faces their yard. 

Xola (their puppy) learned VERY early on that she could summon me with a specific ARF! that she makes, and I'm come running upstairs and out the door to say hello. Every time.

SO, for the last year and a half, there has been a spot where grass once grew that has been worn down into a wallow, and further up on the fence towards the front of the property, there is a hole that has been broken into the grape vines that grow on our shared fence, where she can see me pulling into the driveway on the other side of the front of our house.

Every single day I get to see that wonderful, giant oaf of a dog. She waits there by the fence for hours sometimes, while my neighbour is out there doing yardwork or working in her garage. I'll come out and she'll let me know Xola has been sitting by the fence all morning. When they're gone on vacation and they get back, the first thing Xola does is run to her spot by the fence and summon me. I always know they've arrived back home because of this.


This summer, my neighbours put me in their will to be the godmother to Xola. I told them I'm going to lose my shit if anything ever happens to them, but we all know that she will go to someone who will spoil her rotten and take her on many grand adventures. She reminds me SO much of my last dog, the best dog I ever had, and I'm so lucky to have her.


We're building a new fence this spring and agreed to put a head-hole for her and a small gate between our yards (there used to be one ages ago but the fence collapsed). We joked about just building a dog tunnel into my house so she can go back and forth all she wants.


I love my goddogger so much. Such a good girl.
Awesome that a neighbor would actually do that! 
That's cute.
Why can‚Äôt you have a dog?
This is disappointing cause you didn‚Äôt pet him.

Neighbors are playing the long game, there's at least once a day that someone is dogsitting so they can get it on without the dog whining at the door, or watching from the corner of the room for the people give in.
Dude you have the best neighbors ever
‚ÄúNot allowed to have a dog‚Äù - renting the house (many landlords do not allow pets); a family member is severely allergic; family had a dog die and they are not emotionally ready yet to have another; some cultures view dogs as not being house pets; family member was bit by a dog and has a phobia. (Source: therapist, have asthma, have three dogs, rented once upon a time.)
How old are you? 
My neighbor's dog loves saying hi to me every day. That guy gets me doing chores with the hope of seeing him haha
It is time fren
That was cool of the neighbors.

I‚Äôm like aww. Why the dog didn‚Äôt come running but actual fake he/she is actually waiting. üòç
Here is a long-ass story about my ‚Äúfence dog‚Äù with a happy ending!

My neighbor had the sweetest little dog that always cried when I was outside begging for pets. I started giving her treats and she would act overjoyed, flipping them in the air and chasing them before eating them. She loved the novelty. No one ever played with her. Neighbors were an older couple - or at least the husband was way older. Kids were finishing high school and went off to college. Years passed. The old man died. House started to fall into disrepair. I noticed the pupper seemed lonely, was sometimes left out all night, and I had NEVER seen her get taken for a walk in all the time I lived next door. For weeks and months I didn‚Äôt see her and thought she had died. When I did see her again half her hair had fallen out, and her nails were curling under her toes. She looked sad and lonely. 

I badly wanted to offer to take her to the vet or get her groomed but I felt really weird because I didn‚Äôt know the people at all and didn‚Äôt want them to hate me. (In retrospect I wish I had said something earlier.)

When the for sale sign went up I was super concerned. I knew there was no way the mom (living alone at this point) would be buying another house and feared the dog wouldn‚Äôt go with her to an apartment. (I was also just plain sad to see the dog go, I loved her. And she was friends with my former dog, who had died. It felt like the end of an era. On the other hand, the dog was getting in worse and worse shape and I didn‚Äôt want to see her get worse and then just disappear, it would be easier to just think they moved away.)

I am an introvert, I lived next door for 10 years, petted the top of this dog‚Äôs head over the fence that entire time, never spoke to the actual neighbors. I had so much anxiety about this dog. I even texted the dopey real estate agent who had the house listed (an acquaintance) and asked about the dog. Never got a response. 

By a stroke of absolute random luck, a friend encouraged me to Facebook request her friend, a neighbor across the street. I would sometimes post photos of this dog and talk about how much I liked her. My neighbor got a late night text from a different neighbor, who talked to MY neighbor (confusing) and found out the lady was closing on her house on Monday, and the dog was getting dumped at the pound. She was besides herself because no one would take the dog. It was 11:30pm when I got this Facebook notification at a gas station and I basically screamed. I didn‚Äôt sleep all night because I was so nervous. I marched over there at 8:30am the next day to find an estate sale in progress and the dog in a little baby fence crying her head off. I ran right over and scooped her up. First time in ten years I actually held her properly. Omg, the feels. Just typing this is making my eyes leak. I waited SO LONG to pet more than just the top of her head. 

Estate sale lady comes over and is like ‚ÄúAre you interested in this dog?!?‚Äù And I am like YES YES YES. I tell her the whole story of how I have loved this dog for years, and estate sale lady is overjoyed, her daughter is overjoyed and we start talking details. But then some other random estate sale shopper hears the commotion and  comes over and then decides she wants the dog. That got shut down pretty quickly, but omg, imagine if I had gone over 5 minutes later?

Estate sale lady texts owner, owner is like ‚ÄúOK!‚Äù and I told her I just had to make sure my dogs would accept her and I would adopt her. Then I took her for her first walk ever using my late dog‚Äôs leash. üò≠ Waited around for my boyfriend to get home so we could introduce all the dogs properly on neutral ground. (One of my dogs is an asshole and always got shitty with her from the other side of the fence.)

Well, the dogs ended up all getting along great! We did a trial overnight and I told the neighbor I would keep her. She came over the next day to finalize things and gave me a bag of no name dog food and said the  dog was a reluctant eater. Oh and she had NEVER been to a vet. And then she called ‚Äúbye‚Äù to the dog and left without even petting her or anything. It was absurd. The dog didn‚Äôt seem the least bit upset when she left. I found out later the lady had moved out over a month earlier and was just leaving the dog alone in the basement with no lights on, coming once a day to feed her. (And by the smell of the place never letting her out.)

I know this is long, but wait, there‚Äôs more!

Take her to my saint of a vet a couple weeks later (he was on vacation) and drop her off for a full workup - heartworm test, rabies, distemper, etc. He calls and tells me to come back in. He found a huge mass on her abdomen. Her teeth are rotting out of her face and that‚Äôs why she can‚Äôt eat and smells so bad you can smell her from a room away. And oh yeah, she‚Äôs in heat! And she has a bunch of random cysts and growths. He does an X-ray and the tumor is on her spleen, it‚Äôs a ticking time bomb and it could rupture and kill her at any moment. I have had this dog 2 weeks and waited ten years for her.  I am destroyed. He wants to open her up like NOW, it‚Äôs that‚Äôs serious. I ask to have the weekend to spoil her. He agrees but calls everyday to check in and tells me if she collapses just to put her down, there‚Äôs no saving her. 

The decision is made to open her up, and if she‚Äôs riddled with cancer he‚Äôll put her down while she‚Äôs under anesthesia. If he thinks he can operate he will. 

I drop her off first thing in the morning after our weekend of spoiling her and bite my nails all day. He tells me the later he calls in the day, the better the news will be. Every time the phone rings I jump out of my skin. I wait and wait and wait. 

Finally, at 4:30 I get a call. My amazing vet operated on this little pupper for 5 hours. He took out the tumor, he spayed her, he removed a whole lot of rotten, painful, smelly teeth, he cleaned the remaining ones, he took off all the weird cysts and bumps. He also gave me a huge discount because he knows what a dog lover I am and felt bad for what I ‚Äúinherited‚Äù. (Three generations of my family have taken our pets to him, I love this man.) He tells me to come visit the next day and help feed her, which I do. She‚Äôs a little Franken-dog with stitches everywhere and loopy from surgery. The day after that I bring her home and I even got a little bed and basket to transport her in as the vet tech suggested.  Which was totally not necessary because she immediately leaped out of it and was all over the place. 

The tumor came back benign! Apparently a lot of splenic rumors are, but they are fatal if they rupture. The mass he removed was the size of a freaking lemon. (And yes he showed it to me because my vet gets me as a person.) üòÇ

I swear to god this dog has regressed a good 5-7 years. She‚Äôs at least 11 years old and weighs 17lbs and she straight up owns my two much younger and much bigger dogs. She leads the walks on packs, she steals their bones even though she can barely pick them up. She fearlessly chases down other dogs at the dog park who are bullying other pups. If we need to put her in a crate or have to make her come inside because we are leaving, she runs away and flips over and plays dead so she can extend playtime. She is absolutely hilarious and pure joy. We expected to get an old, somewhat curmudgeonly dog because we‚Äôve had old dogs before. We were fully ok with just taking great care of her for her final years and realized she may have a lot of trouble adjusting or may not bond with us like her first human. I was ok with this. Instead we have this crazy bundle of energy that never stops wagging her tail, snuggles with us every night on the couch and sleeps on our bed, and who acts like everyday is Christmas. 

I sent her former owner an update after surgery explaining what was wrong with her and let her know she made it and was recovering. She said thanks and never texted me again. My vet is convinced if she has gone to a shelter they would have taken one look at her and just put her down. 

She eats like a little piggy now and actually can enjoy eating. And a quality diet + supplements has resolved her hair loss issues. 

This pupper spent 10 years never leaving her yard and likely being neglected. She now goes for car rides all the time, joins us at stores that allow dogs, owns like 6 Halloween outfits and countless sweaters and dog coats (which she loves!), she goes for walks regularly, visits Starbucks for puppachinos, gets marrow bones from the local butcher and basically is living her best life. My boyfriend was kinda like ‚Äúhere we go again‚Äù when I told him I was adopting her but he may be even more in love with her than I am. I catch him cooing at her like a baby sometimes. We absolutely love her and can‚Äôt imagine not having her in our life. This past August was our first Gotcha Day anniversary. I told myself when I took her in if I got just 6 months I would be happy. Best thousand bucks and ten years I have ever spent. 

10/10 would pet over the fence again. 


TLDR: Watch out, that may end up being your dog someday. 


I had a neighbor do something like this for me once but it was inside instead of outside and it was for a toilet instead of a dog. 
I hope you bake them cookies.  Lots and lots of cookies.
I love him!
He kinda looks like my dog, actually. Do you know what breed he is?
Awww, wish I had a dog.
Do you give him snacks like a puppy drive thru window?
Awesome!!
Love seeing happiness like this!
Dog lovers have each other‚Äôs backs!
Oh my gawd! That is the nicest thing! How sweet!!
The most aww thing ive seen in a while


...awww
I've never seen a post with this many upvotes before
My next door neighbors German Shepherd would bite the shit out of me if I had one of those haha. That‚Äôs so cool 
I want this üòç
I wish i had a neighbour like that. 

My current neighbour is a sociopath with schizophrenia who loves to harass my mother and her boyfriend. Things he does include cutting our outdoor satellite tv cable, moving our satellite dish so that it doesn't receive signal, taking down part of the fence in between our houses and building a brick wall without our permission, constantly spreading false rumors about us, talking shite to carpenters/plumbers etc who come here etc. The list really does go on. 
My neighbor, on my floor in my apartment guards her door like ALL THE TIME. She leaves it open and whenever ANYONE walks out to go to the Refuse Room or press the elevator, she sticks her head out and with a spray bottle (it smells like oils, vinegar, and water) until we leave. 
I‚Äôve lived here for 20 years and she still does this, as long as she‚Äôs not outside. 


Edit: You have very good neighbors. Mine sucks. 
This is so wholesome wow
Why does the video end so abruptly?

I love your neighbors. You must be pretty solid too.
Why can‚Äôt you have a dog? 
That's awesome
Best neighbours! ü§ò
It‚Äôs like he/she is just waiting for you to come over to give ALL the love
Very impressive.
They should get a noble prize for nicest neighbors 
Why arent you allowed a dog, OP?
Great neighbor you've got there. My neighbor either ignores my existence or tries to convince me to let her dye my hair blue for a fee. She's kinda weird.
Awwww!! I'm sure they'll let you go play whenever you want to as well! I shared a backyard (lived in a duplex) with a couple, and my snoofer would try to sneak out when the girl was tanning to go snuggle with her. It took me a while to figure it out, because there was a divider that I couldn't see through from the door, but our neighbor and my dog clearly had a friendship, I found out, and when I figured it out I thought it was so sweet and cute. Both of them would play with call play with her when she was outside sometimes, and so she'd demand to go outside if either was out there. Whenever she was out when they went into their side of the duplex, she'd try and force her way in with them. We certainly didn't mind.

We also used to dogsit for my fiancee's Grandpa's dog, and multiple neighbors would come round to borrow him for walks. It was just adorable. There was actually even a rivalry about walking Spaz, and one of the neighbors said the other wasn't as good at walking the dog, so we should only let them on the days that neighbor wasn't going to be around. We had to call to the Grandpa to figure out what to do, and he told us they just get jealous, as the pupper is in high demand apparently. 

People really like people that like their dogs. If I had to rate people based on how much I like them, on a scale of 1-10, they automatically jump like 5 points if they like my dog and want to hang out with her.
I never keep my dog alone, I keep him with my neighbor when I'm not at home, and vice versa, win-win :-)
Does Jake ever go inside?
Thats amazing
cute!
Sorry to hear !

Your neighbours are fricking legends!
Hmmm, if you‚Äôre not allowed a dog, should they be worried when you pet theirs?
