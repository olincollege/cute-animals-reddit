Watched this 19 times before sleep. Good Dreams should follow.
What is that digital frame? It looks pretty cool
Remember reading/watching Harry Potter and thinking how cool those moving pictures would be, well folks we pretty damn there. 

Technology is indistinguishable from magic to the uninformed, or whatever that quote is.
I got that exact same raincoat for my dog! He hates it :(
What a happy boy
Yes, this is very important content.

This is the first time I have laughed out loud in about a month.
WHAT IS THIS SONG??? IT IS DESTROYING ME THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER IT!!!
I don't smile much at my phone for anything but I smiled today!
Now I want a picture frame that tells the weather by displaying costumed doggos enjoying it.
Made me audibly awe

Why is the video so short!? >:(
I thought dogs can't tell the difference in the mirror, not aware of themselves.
Oh fuck me that‚Äôs adorable
Thank you for this .
Can I have a pawtograph?
This gave me the best chuckle
Wow it's so obvious this whole thread is a plant to promote this digital frame BS. What the hell guys.
I hope to die in my sleep peacefully tonight.
Ok but hear me out, a wall filled with these live portraits, arranged in the style of the Shrek 2 main menu
I don't know how to say this, but by definition your dog has become self aware. Usually, dogs do not recognize their reflections and treat it as another animal, therefore not being self aware
YEOOOAAAAAAAAWWWW-
I love how we have Harry Potter pictures that are thin enough to be believable, now.
So happy with that raincoat
Imagine a digital frame like that but with your favorite 5 second moment from a particular porno. We will finally have evolved as a species
Does anyone know the brand of rain coat that is?
Woof woof woof woof! Woof woof woof?
Yep. We're in the future. That's basically a Star Trek TNG super fancy picture frame.

This is the only thing on this sub in weeks that has made me audibly aww
On the real, I'm almost 40. I witnessed the cesarian birth of the interwebs. I withstood the onslaught of 80s hatred only to see it finally reach its final glorious form in the new millennium. I've seen impeachment, emancipation a of a red German line,  the redundancy of plastic surgery and injecrible procedures circumvent medicaire... I've seen just about everything (I'd keep going but I'm about to polish off a case of Voodoo Ranger and the queen of my essence beckons)...

I guess what I'm trying to say is, this is legit one of the best things I've ever seen.
You're a good boye.
I just watched 20 minutes of anti-masker and Karen videos, and I was feeling really depressed about the state of the U.S. And then I saw this. This is what I needed all along.
This has made my morning, thank you
