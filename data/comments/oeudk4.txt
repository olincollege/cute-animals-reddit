The one golden with his back turned as if he is offended cracks me up 😂
It's like PE for dogs
Fuckin idiots 

- that golden retriever, probably
I like the one laying in the front. He seems extra unimpressed with the whole ordeal. I think we'd get along well.
Hysterical. My dog is in the 1st group. 😂
Mine hates water so much that she actively scolds other dogs who try to enjoy wading pools.

https://i.imgur.com/NP5DPdd.jpg
I love this, and was super surprised that there was a Golden with the Border Collies and friends, who actually does not LIKE water!
I love the golden with his back turned to the water. Nope. Nope. Nope
My dog hates water like it's a punishment but when we go to park on hot days I have this pet shamwow type bath cloth I take with me that I pour water on then use to wipe him over to cool him off, he allows that
It's like that group of kids you knew in high school who were too cool to do things involving any sort of fun, so they just stood around and watched everyone else.
It looks like there is also a third type of dog - the white floof in the middle who is so happy to watch the fun and wants to get in, but just not sure if it's worth getting the fur wet today. Love it.
There should be r/dogschompingwater
I wasnt surprised to see a weimaraner at the very back of the 'dogs who hate water' group. Everybody knows weimaraners melt in the rain!
I can’t stop watching this and laughing. The second group are looking like wtf is this and why are they so dumb??
Ha, that’s fantastic.
Our dogs loves water except in bath form. Rain check, pond check, lake check, puddles check, hose check, sprinkler check, pool check, but bath tub full stop, no go, nope out of there.
lmao- I don’t have a dog but why..If I were a dog, I would be the group with the golden retriever facing away
Like on a dance floor
I HAVE to work at one of those doggy daycare places  😂
life pro tip, if you have a garden and have a dog. Do NOT encourage them playing with the hose! It's been a trying season for my iris.
My dog is firmly in group number 2 lol
I habe a lab retriever cross who absolutely loves the little creek at the dog park. Swims in it every time until it freezes over. 


I try to turn the hose on in the backyard and hes GONE! 


I think he associates running water with the dog groomer or a bath and hates it. It scares him. It sucks lol
Damn them dogs judgey af
The collective obstinance is palpable.
u/savethevideo
River - yep

Canal - yep

Skanky ditch - yep

Paddling pool specially bought for her to use during the baking hot weather - nope.
I like how a lot of the "no water" dogs are all black, like they're some anarchist punks who refuse to engage in fun activities lmao
I feel like this is the difference between dogs who get a bath in a tub or a groomer vs ones who get a bath with the hose.
Both my dogs would be in the offended group. One is 50/50 on water as long as it’s just her paws and maybe her face. She is terrified of the hose. The other looks like the world is ending when it rains and will spend the afternoon licking her feet like a cat to try and dry them faster if they get wet.
“Look at those fucking animals George, they’re gonna make this place smell like wet dog”
Looks like the dog equivalent of a middle school dance
Those the hood dogs
I’m the other type of dog.
I have one of each
"Is the water half-bath or half-fun?"

-Unknown Doggo
My dog doesn't mind water under normal circumstances, but refuses to go near anyone with a hose. When he was a puppy, I was watering my plants and he started lapping up water from the hose and he tilted his head and accidentally made it go up his nose.
My dog used to run down the beach, avoiding the water completely, until the day she got wiped out by a sneaky wave. Then she realized how much fun it was and then I couldn't keep her out.
My oldest dog (male 15yr old, Jack Russell pomeranian) would be with the stodgy boys; most chill and wow uptight. 

My 2 girls (one puppy >1yr, and an 8yr old) are wigglebutts and would be Studio 54ing through, under, around and betwixt all the water and other waterdogs.
All my homies hate water
Average water fan vs Average coke enjoyer
I can smell this video
I love how disgusted the no water group looks with the water playing ones..fuckin idiots indeed lol
Lmao. They're all together in a solidarity clump.
black dogs can't swim?
How funny!!!😂
Too funny!
I just got a new dog, she loves chewing on water spray, but I cannot get her to set two feet into a baby pool full of water.  I think I have a little bit of both types in my one dog.
highschoolers meeting kindergarteners
Wow so many dogs!
Our wirehair pointer is terrified of water and runs away even from a watering can.
I love the golden retriever just chilling in the corner
I already knew what was gonna happen but I'm still 100% **HEART** all the way.
New joiners are waiting to mingle.
My dog loves water but hates kiddie pools or water from a hose.
All the dogs in the back must have had tubes in their ears as a child. Lol
The other group is cats disguised in dog suits. 😁
They’re straight up like “Na, we good over here fam”
Choked on my breakfast burrito laughing when the camera turned. 😂
Lol that golden on the far right of the no water dogs just smiling
A pack of nope
"*Kids, it's all fun and games until somebody brings out the shampoo*."

hahaha.. so cute...
There are two types of reposts
But there is only one type of repost

Repost
A good karma-farming submission, always.
Second group of dogs are looking down in the noses with a smug look of superiority, but they’re just missing the fun.
Gotta love reposting for 100k
Finally, I'm around long enough to experience my first re-post in the wild. Yay
Dogs just look super fuckable especially when bouncing around:
[deleted]
...or else it gets the hose again.
Lol I can relate to the ones watching!  That’s me at the beach watching my family and friends swim!
Whelp that’s pretty funny right there lol
Poor dogs (haters) that aren't getting played with...  
  
They look so sad.
The cool dogs in the back be like “I’m already cool why would I need to play in the drink?”
Seems like the Jukin copywrite folks have yet to catch up to Reddit.
Looks like a middle school dance
It looks like a middle school dance.
This is so funny!
Right vs left
Its like a fight at school (without guns) where you have the kids who want to see whats going on, and then you have the other kids who just don't care.
My dogs dont trust me with the hose.... for good reason mwahahaha.
I see shy dogs
Their faces say it all lol.
Maybe they are waiting for their turn.
Too funny!
Looks like a middle school dance
I dont know about that.. golden retrievers are just basically fluffy fish.
Yeah fuck that. I’m not getting wet.
The introverts watching the extrovert at a party they're forced to be at
I love that Golden just staring away haha
Those are clearly Mermutts
My dog would be trying to scale the fence to escape even one drop of water - a Beagle!
This is the "wedding dance floor" for dogs
I like the middle ones who are water curious, but not brave enough to actually get wet.
I love the golden retriever not even acknowledging what’s going on haha. Absolutely priceless
That is something I have never seen ..
I actually thought only cats (some kinds though) can't go in water ...and they actually scared of it ...but here it is ..a proof ..
This is the best!!!!!
What da dog doin?
We love to see it
My mini aussie likes to violently throw himself at the nozzle. These dogs are too tame.
The dog on the right most side at 12 seconds have found nirvana.
No golden retriever shower here please
As usual the two poodles can't make up their minds about what camp they're in.
Haahahaha. I remember when I was little, I was pissing in the forest and my Doberman ran alongside and was eventually watered from head to tail
Lmao this just made me laugh so hard!
This is funny these dogs want no parts of the water
Crazy how animals have personalities, feelings, and emotions!

Go vegan!
Make sure everyone has access to normal water bowls. Lots of dogs in daycare are shy.
This is such an interesting visual. I never thought dogs disliked water. I just learned something today.
My dog would also be terrified of the water!!
The golden retriever on the far right who cannot bear to look at those rough newcomers ,is iconic haha
I love the dog in the back with his back turned. Maybe if he can't see it, it will go away.
/u/savethevideo
Why don’t you try to take them one at a time and get them a little bit used to it so they can have fun and play instead of sitting on the bleachers.
Black dogs don’t like getting their hair wet! 🤣
I have these  two types of dogs-one will play in a sprinkler and play with the water coming out of a hose; the other runs the other way if I do much as pick up a hose within 10 feet of him
My GSD would be in the second group. He hates water. 😆
I one time took my dog (terrified of water) to the lake. We didn’t take him into the water but there was a puddle in the parking lot maybe an inch deep. I picked him up and put him into the puddle, thinking maybe this could be step one into conditioning him to not be scared of water. 

He started shaking in fear. Wouldn’t move so I had to pick him up and put him on dry land lmao
yeah my dog is hiding as far as possible away from that hose
So my dog loves swimming in water but when it comes to hoses, he's in the latter category.
That poor Gordon Setter. They don't like water.
“That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves. They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years.”
This is hilarious!!
I’m both types
Is it two types of dogs or two types of owners?
What is the equivalent of this for humans?
My pity was a breeder rescue. She hates the hose and won’t come near while it is in my hand. I put it in the pool and step away she will tentatively come over and lay a bit. But if I pull or touch the hose she runs away until I turn it off and put it away.
I have two corgis. They would be on opposite sides of this interaction.
two gordons pretending its not happening.
They’re all awesome
My dog is the 2nd type. I really want her to love water play, but she just doesn't enjoy it.
Looking at this as a dog professional and cringing. This is just asking for a dog fight.
Mines in the "yeah, I'll stay dry thanks" camp.
I'm surprised the Gordon setter is in the second group 😅 they're sooo goofy and love water
Wallflowers unite !!
this is the lowest effort doggy daycare ive seen. we have one here in norway and we put them all in cars and drive to the forest and let them loose and walk for 3 hours, theyre pack animals and love us so nobody runs away.
This is a really even way to divide dogs. No in between whatsoever on the whole water thing.
Then you have the two dogs in the middle unsure what to do but still happy.
I always love seeing this
Smiles... Funny and entertaining dogs
Here we have two types of dogs; dogs that act like dogs, and dogs that act like cats
My pup was not a fan of the water until she got around other dogs that were cool with it. Last weekend after our friends' dogs were done playing in the creek, she just stood in the creek for like 20 minutes barking for the other dogs to come back in.
How funny! Silly dogs...it's obviously fun.
The golden is embarrassed because Goldens normally love everything
But there all lookin like good boys/girls
Have a Dane, can confirm!
It's like the club when people are dancing...and then there's that group of people just sitting back, not dancing....quietly.....judging....everyone🤣
Haha
Both sides are probably lookin at the others like “weirdos lol”
Those are aqua doggos, also known as sub-woofers
I have 1 of each type...the jealousy is real from the non water pup.
My dog would be a type 3: she would zoom between the other two types and ignoring the water.
Introverts vs extroverts
It’s funny that any dog would not love water!!!!   Water squirt emoji, water squirt emoji.
These are the "hell yeah fireworks!" and the "fireworks scare my dog" people on July 4th. We see it every year on reddit.
The other side seems to be saying: I really don’t know what’s fun...
Thirst & non-thirsty?
Waiting for that 🔥 album to drop for group 2.
At least give the other dogs some toys, come on!
One big doggie daycare? Where perhaps half the dogs have owners who love playing in the hose and another half with owners who trained them to stay away from the hose.

My parents dog was trained very, very well.... My mom would get so angry if he got messy, mostly since she did most the cleaning, certainly the carpet cleaning... If she was out watering the grass he stayed away, he knew better. If my dad was out watering the grass, and mom was inside or out with friends, and dad could get away with it... the dog would absolutely get wet, have fun, and generally be a good, wet, boy. If I came over to dog/house sit and I was watering said grass, the dog would sit next to me and in his overtrained doggy way beg to play but sat pretty.... until I either encouraged him in or stopped the water. 

Puppy school was like a month long board away type place my parents I think had financed...  No idea what they did but that dog was a mini human.
The council.
For some reason a “Boomers vs Millennials” comparison came to mind.
What are those plastic pools called
I am the dog who loves the water
That Weimaraner in the back is exactly how my Weimaraner would react.
Ahhhhhh those Goldens are something else 😂👏
The dogs that hate the water seem like they got a pretty chill society going
/u/bradleyy13 what i imagine you and me at a rave would look like
The doodle do not know what to do. Mama told me to be smart  but DAD WOULD DO IT!!!!
LOL!
What I’d give to be there right now. Piles of dogs playing.. sounds fun
We have one of each group in our household! My 13 yr old has always hated baths and even played dead when I’d tell him it’s time for one. In his younger days, he’d sneak out of the bathroom and run and hide under our bed. 
My 7 yr old is the complete opposite. She jumped in the bathtub once when I was prepping a bath for my kid. She runs to the water hose and cries for us to let the water run. They complement each other so well 💕
Mine would be the standing off to the side bunch. He loves swimming in brooks and the sea, but get the hose out and he's running for the hills.
I'm not sure if one of them are the original content creator but I've found these from February 15 2020:

Please correct me if I'm wrong and have a nice day :)
Wata bad
Aren't golden retrievers bred to work near water? To retrieve waterfowls for hunters.
Special shoutout to the lovely golden lab no-hose gang member, he still has a lovely smile but politely turns his back to the whole affair :)
Too cute.
Mine is in the second group
My springer spaniel will spend the entire day swimming in circles when we're at the cottage. He drinks water the entire time and then pisses non stop.

You literally have to drag him away from the lake when it's time to go then he sleeps like a stone when we get home, sometimes he has a hard time walking he's so tired.
😭😭😭
There's also a third dog that will eat everything including the hose
The wallflowers (or dog flowers) were the group that got sprayed one too many times with the hose as a prank.
Good to know I don't own the only Lab that hates water.
Extroverts and Introverts
🤣 I have one of each type of dog
Wow! It's exactly the same two kinds of people.
Bruh
The dogs just standing there are like "fuck that".
1st bunch of dogs are your millennials having a good time while your 2and bunch of dogs are boomers bitching about how spoiled millennials are.
I'd watch this version of West Side Story
It's funny how mopey they all look to 😆
this may be a repost but its high quality and includes sound so you are free to pass .
I thought it was the ones in the blue thing vs the ones chasing the water at first lol
there are two types of kids- one=the kids being natural

two= the kids trying to act ccool
My 85 lb boxer hates water. Used to not even be able to take him on hikes near water. He'd plant his ass and dig in with his legs and refuse to move.

This year he met his best friend and now has the confidence to do pretty much anything and has even gone into lake Michigan
Cool kids looking at Noemíes vibes
Introverts vs Extroverts
I'm always happy to see Gordon setters. There aren't nearly enough of them around. Amazing dogs.
Dogos
Old doggos be like *these young biges*
those were d days
lol
Huh, seems like there is a color coordination, is it just a coincidence?
Duality of man... dog.
Posh pet hotel, Palm bch florida.
"Muuuust wait for my turn!" -good boy
Here we have two types of post. Original and not.
lmao this is exactly what it looks like in denmark whenever there's a beach/pool situation
Repost but I will still upvote it every time lol
The back street boys
My whole life, 10 dogs, not one of them liked playing in water. Two of them played fetch. I don't know how my family ends up with such boring dogs.
I've seen this many times before, but it remains one of my all time favourite videos on the internet.
Aw!
I know who the non swimming canines are as well as the ones that don't like bathing. You can apply this to Humans as well....
This should remind you guys that a the dog’s Breed does not determine it’s personality, it mostly just tells you it’s skillset and needs.
Haha
My dog thinks all water is amazing and fun except when he's about to get a bath, then water is just horrible. He's unhappy, frozen in fear like a goat, I'm throwing praises at him, petting him, giving him some to drink(not soapy), trying to play but nah, water still sucks.
They are so disgusted😂
I love big dogs. They have such personality.
Taking the kids to the water park and Just watching
Surprised there is a golden in the no water group lol
This made my day! Thanks for that.
My dog would be completely by himself, off in the corner thinking he's with a bunch of morons
I only see the one and only type of dog.
Awesome.
The sandy brown one in the middle's face 😂
Lolol the dogs off to the side are just talking crap and gossiping about the wild ones
Some of the anti water dogs are labs! That's crazy
Like this vidio
The elders
lol imagine that meme, “all my homies hate…(water)”
Wait a second can black dogs not swim?
I see 3 types of dogs.

1) The dogs scurrying around for a few drops of water.
2) The bystanders just watching everyone.
3) The ones in the background pool just happy and content with what they have.
My family dog loved playing in the hose and sprinklers. But hated the rain or baths. She was a goof and I miss her every day.
Like extroverts and introverts
what would you do for the dogs that don’t love water? this is such an unfair play time.
That's some sturdy opposition right there! Full disapproval.
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I’m absolutely dead 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Of course the Dobie is hiding
In next few million years the dogs which love water turn to be whales and dolphins
Lol! Notice the Weimaraner at the very back of the group of dogs who do not like water!!! I own a Weimaraner and that look on the face!!! Like , “what the hell? That water is cold!”
My 2 pups would definitely be in the I hate water club.
This makes me sad!
Love the look on the Dobies face!
The duality of good boys and girls
My dog is the second type of dog. My dog is a golden doodle and she should love the water. However, when she got the opportunity, she just ran out of there barking and growling at it which is strange since I thought she loved water when we found her in a toilet when she was younger. We took her to the beach, and what do you know, she ran away.
Dogs n kids have so many similarities
Dogs are like toddlers they suck at lying
The one laying down has had enough of OPs shenanigans
Those dogs hate water hoses because they’ve had ear infections before
Anyone know what breed of dog that white one with the black goggles is?
😂😂😂
dogs be like this is dopes! the other dogs be like thats a Nopes!

r/floofyboop
Seems like a prison gang looking down on another
r/likeus
I know which type my dogs are, and it disappoints me
Extroverts vs introverts
Just like people
Seems like quite a few of the dry dogs are...a little grey? :D
"This looks suspiciously like a bath."
So true
You have the people who love talking and then you have the people who hate talking
Anybody have a guess at what Breed(s) the non-water white dog with black on the face/ ears is? 

Looks like my rescue that I don’t know the breed(s) of but was told lab/hound mix.
Of course the Doberman is part of the anti-water crew lmao
Oh! Surely you have built a large dog farm and it is good
I have a rescue dog that has PTSD about water from being tied to a tree for a year and left outside in the cold, rain and thunderstorms.
Definitely the second group.
Patient and impatient dogs
Can’t blame the black dogs , they can’t swim
The poor golden can’t even look.
The one lying down giving them the stink eye got me!🤣🤣🤣
LOL
And then the 3rd kind that tries to Swallow the end of the hose 🤣🤣
Dogs getting wet: oooo yer give me the waterrrr
Dogs sitting back: ooo boy we got the special crew at nursery today…
The Gordon Setter is like are these guys nuts?
I think the dogs on the far end away from the water are mocking the other dogs for “voluntary baths” even tho there is no soap lol
I loved when my last dog would attack the stream of water like she wanted to eat it out of existence. No matter how many times it happened I would laugh almost to suffocation. The more I laughed the more furious she went with the attack. Dogs are the best. 😂
I have two dogs, one of each type.
Me smoking a joint with friends while the rest of the party plays drinking games
lol one type of dog that is having fun and cooling off and then the other group staying hot and scared lol
The lit people vs the quiet chill group
“Fuck water! Me and my homies hate the water!”
Its like the squidward peeking thru blinds meme
I always upvote this video 😍
r/likeus
The extroverts and the introverts
My 15 week old puppy likes to walk through the shower when I'm having one. Sometimes he just chills at my feet. Then he complains he's cold afterwards 🙄😂
Old but gold(en retriever)
Lol so true
My Yorkie and poodle are of the second set of dogs' mindset.  Unless ducks are involved.
Team “OUI!” vs Team “NON.”
All the dogs I've owned were weird. Whenever I tried to bath them they hated water and getting wet, whenever it was raining they loved water and couldn't stop them from getting wet. Stupid dogs.
I see many doggos who you trying to fool?
okay, now i miss my dog  
he was a water hater tho
Look at them savages - ^Dogs ^at ^the ^back
"The fuck are they doing over derr!!"
Lol
The one hating water aren't dogs they are cats in dog form
That golden doodle is having none of that, thank you!
Awww, those other ones are probably afraid of fireworks also. :)
It's like doggie high school.
What land is this land, were you can just let the water flow with total disregard?
Introverts vs Extroverts
Tech house vs techno fans
Amazing
I have seen this one before
This is perfect because I have a dog in each category. I love this ♥
The golden retriever looks like every loser on a game show, "I'm just happy to be here, Bob."
🤣🤣🤣🤣the Great Dane? That’s me. That whole group looks like DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT 😀
Dogs are the best.
I worked at a day car and it was so hard to use the hose without the goof balls chasing the water. I would have to spray right, clean left, spray right, clean left. But it was so fun. I don't know if any of the owners were upset that their pups were wet.
My Rottweilers favorite game is butting the water it’s the cutest this ever
On the left we have the regular dogs who enjoy their playtime and on the right we have the "mean dogs" (like the mean girls) who do not wanna associate with them bc it's beneath them and they find them weird. It's just like human school.
Someone will eventually yell “adult swim,” and then all the young pups will have to sit out while those good dry dogs get their pool time.
Love it so happy
So. Cute ❤️
Looks like a movie's prision yard.
I love when dogs bite at running water.
Introverts vs. extroverts?

Party dogs vs. wallflowers?
Doberman don’t generally like water
I own one of each and it’s so strange to me. My 12 year old lab is OBSESSED with EVERYTHING. Ball? Yes. Water? YES. Bubbles? HOLY CRAP YEAH! My 2 year old Akbash… well if it’s not food, a walk/run, or snuggles he’s not interested.
This is adorable 😂😂
Good boy gang
this made my eternity
Is it weird that I am kind of sad for the second group?  Reminds me of when the kids would be playing at recess while some of us sat on the sidelines because we weren’t asked to play.   Ok... so I may still have some unresolved issues.  Lol!
Stoners and SWAT dogs!!!
Good move reposting this on a hot day 😜  
(Hot in most of the US anyway.)  
  
Still, might be a bit early to call it the  
“dog days of summer.”
Proud owner of one of each 😂
I love the goldendoodle in the middle. He's sooo undecided. Part of him wants to play with the water pups but the other half of him doesn't wanna get wet lol
The way the water-haters are in a close defensive formation
*"Hi, I'm repost bot and this has been posted 5,601 times since Apriluary Somethingth Twentydiggitytwo."*
Are the others broken?
Not me noticing the dogs that hate water are black
I am quite astonished that some hunting dogs are afraid of water !
This looks like some westbside story biz
Yep. My pup would be in that second group. When we go to the dog beach she will stand at the edge of the water and bark at any dogs playing in the ocean. It's like she is yelling at them about how dangerous it is and they need to get out!
Surprised to see the Golden sitting this one out
Aye man you want in on this? Nah, I'm good bruh.
This pretty much sums up all of us.
The laying down tan one is judging hard!
Does anyone know what type of dog that is to the far left at the 11 second mark?
Our dog growing up hated bath time. When I left college she didn’t get as many baths. Every time I came home from college I would give her a nice bath. Apparently she only liked it when I would give her baths. Because everyone else had a hard time getting her to behave during bath time. After her bath I would feed her a can of chicken broth with steamed rice lol I know weird combo but all my dogs have loved that treat. Maybe that’s why she behaved when I gave her baths because she knew a treat was on its way lol 😂
I laughed way to hard at this!!   Thank you!
My dog loves water if it's a beach, lake or pool but if you have something to spray her down with, she wants nothing to do with you
And they are black, someone had to say it.
My loves 😄 dogs best friends
That’s hilarious
The sheer amount of posed NOPE hahahaha
Mine would be screaming and trying to clear that back wall.
Those are the dogs that get the hose at home.
“Ummm… I don’t wanna take my shirt off.”
Reminds me of going to the club. There are people on the dance floor and the rest are on the sides just watching...
Its funny how they are all sitting together like if one goes down they all go down. They can spread out but must feel safer sitting in a group.
Completely unsurprised to see a Doberman in the “no thanks” group 🤣
Cool
Extroverts vs. introverts
I've had a newfoundland that loved water, and one that hated it. Who even knows...
One of my dogs HATES water
It’s like people, such as with skydiving.  You have the type that will gleefully jump out of a plane, and the other going 

“Yeeeaaaah we’re not doing that shit.”
Every school disco ever.
Is that a retriever not getting in on the water action? Mind blowing tbh
So cute!
My favorite video
Lol, I have one of each!
Look mummy. The peasants are dancing in the fountains again! Look away dear. Their kind are beneath us. I've heard them begging their owners for treats. 

Ha...Dog Elitists.
“Nope.  We are not messing up our hair.”
My doggo is so the second group. But she would be next to the human recording it because she prefers humans to dogs.
*My Mom says I can’t get wet*
No bath! Only dry
Give it time and the right motivation and the second group will become like the first group.

The kelpie I used to have was firmly in the second group, until I got a little staffy that was firmly in the first group.  It took about 2 years, but eventually the kelpie started to emulate the staffys water antics, mainly because he was smart enough to realise that it meant playing with me.
Like a high school dance
There are two types of dog in this world. Avoid them both till next time friends
While I agree that I love this lol...

I have a suspicion that this is an obedience school and those good bois in the background were told they cannot play with the water yet (stay).  Essentially, they are waiting for their turn.  

I sincerely hope that those good bois, eventually, got to have the same fun as the first doggos did.
I can hear my moms voice telling me I’d better not get my hair wet at the pool!  These dogs are my spirit animal.  🤣😂
u/savethevideo
I have a Doberman and he gives the exact same expression (ears flat out) with the look of ‘stay away from me’ as this Dobie does.  
I love it.
Gang War boutta go down
This is how my dog acts at daycare vs at home with the hose
We have one of each at our house
This is not a joke..with so many dogs
I like the anxious looking guy all the way in the back.  He's got that "PLEASE DON'T ASK ME'  look about him.
“I dare say, the young ruffians are roughhousing with the water spraying contraption. How incredibly droll.”

*adjusts monocle*
The ones that hate the water look like a group of old people sighing: "how nice it is to be young"
The has and the has nots
That’s hilarious
Anyone else catch the chocolate lab hiding in the back of the waterless group? The absolute shame!!! 😂😂😂
If I say “lake” my husky mix knows we’re going kayaking and he doesn’t mind even when he falls in, he won’t swim, but loves riding in the boat. If I even start to say “bath” he will find the furthest point in the room, or nearest human to hide behind.
Can't believe this got stolen again.
My dog is number 1
Looks like the ones that hate it have their ears going back
And then there are the dogs all trapped in an area extremely too small for all of them to relax, while you make a video. How hilarious, half of the dogs fucking hate what you are doing but have nowhere to go......haha, what next, “let’s see how many dogs like the vacuum cleaner!”
The swag level of those silent dogs are next level 😂💯
😂😂😂😂😂👌🏼
I like the two in the blue pool
This gave me a good chuckle 🤣
This gang and that gang
My puppy always rushes into the shower with me but the older brother hates water
Cure fans at a Punk festival
Black dogs can't swim
Mine is the second type
This is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time.  Both my dogs are in group 2 and would be looking at group 1 like they're nuts too.
Introverts vs Extroverts
“Imma be standing my ass, right the fuck over here”- those dogs probably
It looks like a gang stand-off in anime
On the stick thing, I was the type of student who would figure out a way to gain access to the class when no one is there and take my stick out of that dang jar!
Dang the majority love water while the minority hate it, sounds like something else
Land and water seals
I can smell this video.
Hello
And never the Twain should meet.
OMG how funny!!!
Even black dogs hate the water.
I'd like to remind people that there is also an intermediary group consisting of 2 dogs.
😂
That second half is my pomchi. I had a Jack Russel that was the first half. Dogs are mental and I love them.
Wall flowers, sadly enough that’s me no doubt.  Watching the cool kids have fun.
Ain’t dat da truit.
My dogs are from the group that hate water
So cute
too much cuteness while im listening to sad music
It's like when your class chooses an activity you hate/can't participate in so you just sit in a corner throughout it.
Just an FYI, be careful playing with your dog with the hose. They can accidentally inhale water and drown!
So cute. I think its gecko due to suction feet.
Millennials and Gen Z
laughed so hard there were actual tears
It is true though hahaha
☺️
You look like your in paradise
If only racist jokes were funny and didn’t hurt feelings
Introverts vs extroverts 😂😂
wrr
Why though?
Extroverts vs introverts
😂
I thought of the Godfather when I saw the other group of dogs lol
Emo dogs
