We had a dog named Watson here, yesterday! Now we have Mycroft. All we're missing is Sherlock! 
Fluffy tail - Check

Wearing socks - Check

Adorable - Check

Yup, that's a nice fucking cat right there.
I misread that as Microsoft and thought, "this guy really likes windows" :)

An upvote for cuteness, a double upvote for name. 
What breed of cat is this?
It‚Äôs so fluffy I‚Äôm gonna die! 
Get another and name it Sherlock. Then get a dog and name it Watson.
Come on someone name a dog Moriarty.
I‚Äôm sorry you had to wait 28 years. The cat is beautiful. I hope you are joyous now with a new companion. 
It must feel so great!

It will be 15 years before I get another pet, that day will be glorious. I really miss having a pet. 

Cheers 
Look at those ear floofies!
Cat name of the week.

Easy win too. Seriously great choice of name.

Meowcroft!
Congratulations!!! In love with the ear floof 
Hello Minecraft!

Serious question.

Looks soft.  Like Mycrosoft.
Such a beautiful cat!

Who else mistakenly read the name as "Microsoft"?

&#x200B;
I submit that is not your pet, that is your supervisor. 
I‚Äôm the smart one Sherlock....
I Am The Smart One
You waited 28 years and couldn't even spell "have" right
I bet your cat looks at you dumb when you call it's name
what breeds this?
Why would you name your cat that
Ayup gonna pour one out to Mycroft 
Love the name! He will be up to no good I guess lol
Awesome name

Congratulations! I‚Äôm was just sitting here with my dog (Butters) sitting in my lap and watching my cats (Laverne and Shirley) play in an empty box and was thinking about how much joy they bring me...and I‚Äôm an old curmudgeon. Pets are the best!
Adorable kitteh and GREAT name choice!

That is going to be one spoiled kitty.  Congratulations on your new furry baby üòª
So expressive!

Fitting name
That is a super handsome kitty! I hope you are worth him OP!
I'd wait 28 years for her, too!
The fuzzies coming out of Mycroft‚Äôs paws üòç
Where is Sherlock?
Congrats on making the move and getting your first pet! :D I've always lived with pets, and they never fail to brighten your day. I wish you and Mycroft the best! 
Wow not really a cat person, but what a beauty
I could just have missed it in the huge amount of comments, but I have to know: Sherlock or seaQuest reference on the name?
Hello Microsoft
I've heard this name before somewhere in some movie or video game. Can someone please refresh my memory? 
Well, hello there mister Holmes!
That cat looks exactly like Judi Dench. üëç
awesome! I didn‚Äôt have my first pet until 26 (I‚Äôm 37 now), my cat Gracie. still got her. here‚Äôs to many years together! 
What a handsome fellow!
He seems very polite 
Mike Roft? Wow, what a name.
So Sherlock‚Äôs brother turned into a cute cat?
Cat be like: "the east wind is coming hooman, its coming to get you!"
" 'I am a . . . solitary . . . man,' he said. 'I do not suffer fools gladly, and I prefer to spend my time alone with a book and a decanter of brandy.' "
I waited a long time for my first pet too. It's THE BEST. I have two cats now and honestly it was the missing puzzle piece, my life is complete.

I wish you and Mycroft the happiest and fluffiest life together.
Some friendly tips on how to properly treat your new gato:

1.If you want to put restrictions on certain things just point you index finger out above his head and repeat "no" while pushing gently your hand towards him. This will help with some basic rules when it comes to your space and hygiene for your house, for example he'll try to get a hang of your food while you eat if you treat him from time to time with it, or maybe get on top of furniture not necessarily productive for him to be in, such as a dinner table.

2. Also, play with him, an intelligent pet requires this kind of interaction quite often, even more if you don't let him out the house, that will make him bond with you really quick. 

You can emulate small preys with objects, or even play hide and seek or tag each other lol it dont even take more than 5 min; don't forget lazers, and identifying bugs for him. 

Playing with you hands  is common, but it'll get obnoxious for him and you in time, and it also can backfire because everytime you go touch him, he'll start biting and clinging his nails onto you.

3. It may be funny or cute seeing him angry and annoyed, just don't push it to much, if you are interacting with him and all of the sudden he gets aggresive, just let him be...cats are real temperamental, if they don't like something they'll let you know right away. Give him his space, as same as you would like space in your life.

4. If you want to keep furniture save, put scratchers all over the place, or just on rooms he visits the most. Also, clean his box daily, just 1 time is enough.

5. Change his water regularly and call him for his meals if you can, nothing like seeing him all excited heading for his plate, he may even thank you with a disctintive short "purr" sound. Not a meow, it'll be more like a short vibrating sound.

6. Once bonding level 6 is achieved, he may bump his head on you to say hi while in purr mode, massage your belly or even just rub on you   to  show you his affection; bump your head with his' to achieve maximum bonding level. His tail will be curved to the side every time he tries to interact with you in this way.

7. If you see him wink at you, he's telling you he cares for you, so wink back! If you catch him staring at you, wink first and he may wink back, which in my humble opinion is just fucking awesome. 

Hope you find this helpfull! You got yourself an awesome cat, treat him well and you'll get the same response back! 






Mycroft?

&#x200B;

I hope you're giving him a good .... Holme(s).
That's a beautiful kitty! And a bonus face in the right ear!
Magnificent
This is the right name for this cat.
Your Mycroft is so cute! And it looks like your Mycroft and my Sherlock could be brothers! (Same grey with white belly patch and white socks, but less floof)
meet microsoft
Totally Worth the wait. Super cute cat
it was like 06:45 and i read ‚ÄúMinecraft‚Äú
[deleted]
Initially read Mycrosoft
Mycrosoft
mycroft or..yourcroft?
Not to mention sitting with front paws perfectly side by side with head ever so slightly tilted, nawwww.
What breed? Amazing cat, fantastic name.
I read the name as Microsoft then mycrosoft and thought you were trying to be funny with the names then finally read it as mycroft
What a beautiful cat! congratulations, and welcome to the world of being owned by a cat.
he's just a little kitty with a litter box. he gets two meals a day. he's a very good kitty. he's so fluffy and nice and he plays with strings he's so cuddly he's just the most amazing cat ever!

he looks cute and sweet :)

kind of looks like the long haired version of my cat Bo. Gray and white cats are VERY sweet and squishy in my experience. And they hide how smart they are by being quieter than other cats. Bo doesn't meow that much. Just when it's mealtime, lol. Or when I get home... jk I guess he meows all the time.
Y'know when you lay eyes on someone and you just instantly know what their name is, and it turns out you're right?

That is this cat.  This cat was Mycroft the moment I saw it, the name is absolutely perfect for this fluffy little ball of cute.
That face says ‚Äúhow long do I have to stand like this?‚Äù
Is it just me or is the Batman symbol outlined on its chest?
It‚Äôs got a downvote on its chest...  
everyone UPDOOT as much as you can!
Your cat is beautiful! It‚Äôs so wonderful to finally get an animal when circumstances dictate otherwise. 

My longhair dachshund is named Mycroft, I‚Äôve never seen anyone else with the name!

I‚Äôve only had four people know what it was from as well, and most of them knew it from the stories. We get a lot of ‚ÄúMinecraft?‚Äù ‚ÄúMicrosoft?‚Äù.

The jokes are great though. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not My Croft, that‚Äôs Your Croft!‚Äù Bonus points if your first name is Lara :D I get to pull ‚Äúthis is Lara‚Äôs Croft‚Äù whenever I‚Äôm feeling silly. 
Mycroft? What? 
Meincrompth
Should have named Meowcroft. You missed a chance.
Where‚Äôd you get the name from? Cute though üòç
Sorry I didn't understand you correctly.

Did you say Microsoft or Minecraft? 
No Shit Sherlock.
Shame you couldn't wait three more seconds to proofread your title.
28 years to think of a good name, and you came with Mycroft? (:
I think you misspelled Microsoft
First pet....names it Mycroft....your winging it aren't you lol
is Mycroft short for Microsoft which is short for Micro-Fiber-Soft?
He looks like a Pomeranian cat 
So cute!! 
Awww! I have a pig named Mycroft! 
Now you'll have to wait 28 more because I'm petting that catto and bringing him with me.
Your Croft is adorable
What was the editing on the floor for

Mycroft is the perfect name for this cat.
OMG! so fluffy im gonna die!
Great name!
He looks just like a Mycroft!
Is name Heinlein or Sherlock inspired? Adorable kitty, hope you have decades of snuggles and play together.
Pussycat!
Now you need another called Sherlock (since they were brothers in Doyle‚Äôs stories)
Precious!
Doyle or Fforde?
Some ear whiskers you have there Mycroft 
Lol. You didn't get a pet. That cat got a human.
Well hi Microsoft!
Fucking cute,  I don't think this one is an asshole, but he's gonna be a bad ass in 15 years.

That's the cat version of nice Midwestern librarian. Good job. 
That name, yes.

That is the face of an angel! 
My cats name is Miss Monster but she‚Äôs the most docile cat ever :) we both have name out cats weird names
You made a good choice.
Sherlock or Avernum? I'm gonna pretend it's Avernum.
Get him a partner and name him Purrlock.
Sooooooooo fucking cute!!!!!!
Very proper
Yup, a cat.
Beautiful
That‚Äôs not a pet ... that‚Äôs a cat 
Very pretty!
This cat has already started plotting your death. 
He's cute, but I doubt my cat Moriarty would like him very much
Looks very..... fully functioning
You choose wrong
Isn't he a handsome boy
My cats name is Sherlock. Think they‚Äôd get along?
28 years and you haven't learned to proofread before you post.

Ugh

wait im not hating or anything but does this post get upvotes because u waited 28yrs? or because the cat is adorable lol
Great name! Now where‚Äôs Sherlock?....
H a v r
If the cat is peeing inside/on clothes/carpet/bed it probably has a UTI.

(I say this to all first time cat owners, because even many vets don‚Äôt know this)
So many tufts! 
Floof!! Congrats on your new family member! :)
I DID MY WAITING, 28 YEARS OF IT !
is Mycrosoft?
I hate it when a cat is more beautiful than me. And it happens a lot.
Dapper as fuck.
That cat's cute AF.
I‚Äôm glad he found a good Holmes. 
It's like the cat is asking, "So is this gonna be a regular thing?"  I hope so! 

Congrats!  I'm jealous since I can't have one of my own right now.
Literally thought it said Mycrosoft lol
The only reason I downvoted is because you WAITED TOO LONG!!! (just kidding no downvote also congrats on the hellcat that adopted you)
Oh my lord I am gritting my teeth so hard . So damn cute !!!!
I love how you named him Mycroft.
Mycroft got all those up-votes...    by shining a laser pointer at Reddit Comments.
I love the furry ears
Off to Terrible start with that name...
Gonna guess the breed is a ragamuffin, looks very similar to our cat Rufus (in his case Dufus will suffice, he's not the brightest bulb in the box). If your gorgeous day is a ragamuffin, they're an off-shoot of ragdoll cats, with very fine almost downy fur, ear tufts, and for some reason they love to be cradled like babies. Thanks for the pic, Mycroft looks like a lot of fun!
The name tho Sherlock's brother
He needs a little brother named Sherlock. 
Mycroft is a handsome boy! Congratulations on him getting his first pet human! 
Love the name, love the Kitty. 
That is a fucking adorable cat. 

Also, I like the ear-hair. 
Purrfect name
Earstache on point.

Idk why I read "Microsoft"

Pretty kitty

Beautiful cat!
Did you want a cat as a 6 or 18 months old baby too? 
its is a big floof
So adorable, you have been adopted by a beauty.
DON'T FUCK IT UP!

Prepare for an intense hatred that you will sometimes enjoy.

Hello kitty!
Looks like a good kitty. I got my first pet at 25 last year. Me and my girlfriend adopted a cat who was 8 years old at the time. We love her and she‚Äôs happy being with us, we like a quiet home and so does our cat.
Look at that face-chaos awaits! Congrats 
You know something? That cat LOOKS like a Mycroft. Don't know why, but he does. 
Mycro(so)ft Companion 
Mycroft looks chill af.

Why are redditors so bad at naming animals?
Those ear-whiskers could detect a soviet missile launch from Des Moines.

Mycroft is the perfect name for that cat!
What a beautiful floof. Worth the wait! 
Looks like a Mycroft with the judgy eyes.

I REEAALLY want a dog a cat. I'm in school though, and I have little money. One day I'll get them. One day when I'm in my fifties probably when I have a little more time and money. 
*gasp*
You waited 28 years so you could name a cat Mycroft
Cute

Yourcroft is very cute

Crushed the name. MYCROFT. Love it
And we'll be Sherlocked
Your gonna go into the vet and say that name? 
I've been waiting for 27 tears and still don't have a pet. I can feel your joy. 
Mycroft will bring you happiness. :)
OP too lazy to read the title.
Mycrotch
i‚Äôm assuming you are a gloriously white person. As only one of my Caucasian brothers and sisters would name their cat Mycroft.
I thought it said Microsoft, which makes sense. He's micro and he's soft
_GIMME NOW_
If it was a human we would be disgusted with long hair coming out of the ears. Here it's super cute. 

Congratulations on the cat! :)
Is your name, Lara?
Of course that cat is named Mycroft. You say it. I look at him. That is 100% a Mycroft.
Just watched a Sherlock Holmes movie yesterday. The name really stuck with me. Great name choice.
If he is soft, he is microsoft
I think of Minecraft with that name
kitties with socks give me life 
Little Mycroft belongs to r/supermodelcats üòç So photogenic. 
Your cat has the image of a young man/boy in their right ear.
28 years to typo the title.

Unbelievably cute cat tho!!
Looks like my cat, is she cymric?
Mycroft, so soft.
wow awful name
Hey does this cat have round pupils?
Don't have all housecats the slit like one?
All he needs is a lady companion called Lucy furr.
Please get his booster at 16 weeks in case of maternal antibodies.
Upvote for an awesome name and a gorgeous cat! 
He‚Äôs beautiful!
Hope you havr a real long time!
That is the most elegant, beautiful cat I have ever seen. I am crying because I love cats and I am alone.
My god what a beautiful animal
 Annoyed at the lack of Sherlock references.
Mycroft ey? Do they have a brother named Sherlock!
Lemme preface this. You're cat made me think of this beautiful girl with cats. 

I hope its treated the same way you would any person you love. 
He‚Äôs marvelous!
I'd pet this critter.... I hate being allergic to critters.
Gorgeous
He looks very polite.
Cute and with extra long ear-brows!
He looks very soft. Mycrosoft.
I would die for him
I love the name!
He's gorgeous! What breed is he (or she)?
My cat is called Moriarty :D

How many years were you planning that name?
Mycroft a g

Dumbest fucking name I but it‚Äôs not like it cares what you call it

Yeah. Cat people are weird.
I want him to be my Croft.

Omg that cat is so fucking cute 
Thank you for introducing us to Yourcroft. 
He looks like a Mycroft.
he looks like a cuddle bunny, just so cute
Hey Mycroft, where is Sherlock?
Named after the Sherlock Holmes character or the Jasper Fforde character?
That is a NICE cat!
Definitely looks like a Mycroft. Perfect name for a perfect kittie
>Fluffy tail - Check

>Wearing socks - Check

>Adorable - Check

>Yup, that's a nice fucking cat right there.

Yep, top comment got it right. My question...how did you come up with his name?  It's sort of unusual, even though I've heard quite a few that are more unusual. 

Happy 1st cat day. 

E. Aww, he has white murder mitts. So cute and innocent. Watch your back. /s
Love the name!
Where is his high functioning sociopath of a brother? 
Perfect in everything, So cute
that is the cutest living thing I have and ever will see 
GREAT name choice. Love the Holmes reference. 
I'd call it "Microsoft" by mistake
Made by Mycrosoft
I thought you named her Microsoft

Mycroft Holmes is that you?
The kitter looks so sweet and innocent. Love their eyes!
Mycrosoft

LOOK AT THE EAR FLOOFS 
He looks perpetually disappointed with his high functioning sociopath brother
Cuuuuuute.

(his name is Sherlock, and I sure hope your cat is more of a gentleman than ours Holmes family member is)
She‚Äôs a beaut, Clark!
Rule number one be mindful of your door at all times lol
Thought it was your first pet, not your first croft
OMG this cat is so damn adorable!!!
That mf cat is Adorable af!!! 
Mycroft is such a great name.  Are you a Sherlock Holmes fan or is it by happenstance you chose this name?
OMG looks exactly like my Josie RIP ‚ù§Ô∏è she was the sweetest cat ever!!!
Total adorableness!!!
As a Sherlock Holmes fan I approve. If you get them a friend may I suggest Moriarty or perhaps Carbuncle if you want to be less obvious.
Mister Holmes! 
I lovr her
Oh cool. My kids love minecraft.
Why did I think that said Microsoft? 
All he needs is an umbrella. 
Beautiful. I don‚Äôt even really like cats. 
Perfect pet! Congrats
Ourcroft*
Well worth the wait. What an absolute floofy cutie pie! 
That is literally Mycroft Holmes in cat form. Excellent choice of name.

Shitty name but that cat is cute as fuck.

Wow!! Beautiful cat!!!!
Hello adorable :D 
"*Unwise*, b*rother mine*."
What? Microsoft?
who is the guy in the right ear?
Well I‚Äôll give you a mulligan on the name 
Welcome to the Feline Fascination club, Mycroft. Rules of domestication include laying directly on keyboards and the top of your slave's head, forgoing expensive toys in favor of a ball of foil and that flies are sky raisins ‚ù§Ô∏è
That posture
Adorable
 Holy moly, one of the cutest cats I have honestly ever seen 
My name is Mycroft or Microsoft. ü•∫
Wtf is a mycroft
You may soon find that one just isn‚Äôt enough!  Hello Mycroft! 
Not often do I go vocalise "Awft, he's good" in a pet voice on a crowded train. But boy do I not regret it 12/10, best floofer.
Now you'll have to get a sibling named Sherlock. 
Holmes, sweet Holmes.
