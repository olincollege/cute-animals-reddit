Wow. Only coyotes I've ever seen were full size
I wanna pet but I know it's a really bad idea.
I see babies, I fear mom is waiting in the bushes.

It's a setup!  ;)
Watch out for tiny anvils!
Oh my it‚Äôs adorable! Is it odd its not with mom? Or will pups run to humans alot? I hope its ok
This is your pokemon now. You've been chosen.
"I know this is weird, but I am small and require love."
Not afraid of humans = BAD
Little guy looks like he could use some help. Mange on his ears and he's really thin. Hope he made it to a wildlife sanctuary.
Aw, it‚Äôs adorable! Though it‚Äôs best for the critters to not approach any wildlife ‚Äî no matter how cute they are.
Do you want dogs? Because this is how you get dogs.
Poor thing!  You may want to call your local wildlife rescue‚Ä¶ the pup looks a bit too thin and this isn‚Äôt typical behavior.
Approaching wild coyotes is not a good idea. Rabies ain't a joke.
This is the opposite of what you should do if you see a wild Coyote. You're supposed to instill fear of humans in them, that way no possible bad future incidents can occur with a Coyote that isn't afriad.

Google Coyote Hazing.
Oh man, poor guy looks hungry.
So very cute, but you're supposed to haze them
This is where I nope the fuck out... just in case Momma is near by.
I hope it‚Äôs not orphaned.
poor thing :(
What do you do in this situation?  From what I know about dogs this one is in a situation where it no longer has its mom, but it‚Äôs also a coyote so idk if you can just pick it up and take it somewhere.
Looks very undernourished poor thing.
He needs his mom!
‚ÄúAre you my mom? No you smell wrong.‚Äù üòÜ
Haha watched it without sound first and her reaction was exactly the same as mine\^^
Either mama is out hunting. or mama is dead and he will soon be dead. its one or the other.
Either momma is nearby... Or if she isn't then that pup is going to be lunch for something else.
the mother must‚Äôve been nearby, please do not approach wild animals cubs. you might get hurt very bad.
I‚Äôm sorry I would have to take him home
Kind of looks like he has some mange starting on his head
I'd keep it
Please help him
The proper thing to do is throw some bait at it. Then while it's snacking, you capture it with a PokeBall.
I hope Mom is near by.
The Daily Coyote I s a great blog by a woman who took in a coyote pup when it lost its mother. She lives in Wyoming and did everything she could to protect it from hunters but kept it free to leave whenever it wanted. It wore a red collar so neighbouring ranchers knew it was Charlie. He lived with a couple of cats and I think a dog from time to time. I‚Äôd recommend the blog as Shreve is a wonderful photographer and conservationist.
I‚Äôm aware I‚Äôm a bad person and it wouldn‚Äôt be a good idea but that there would be my new best mate, little legend would be coming home with me
Don't fucking feed it
Fun fact, killing them will only make them breed larger litters, more often.

Coyotes might seem like a menace in some areas, but they are very good for nature.

If you complain about coyotes because they've killed some pets or chickens, get a grip and try to understand their actual role in **their** habitat.
You got a pokeball on you?
This is so dumb. That coyotes mom is nearby somewhere and will defend her children. You should never approach one like this.
I would have been so tempted to interact with him .
What happened to the pup?? Looked forlorn
so...lost its mom?
Cutest thing I've seen today
Where momma? ü•∫
Id be worried about where the mom is
Did you find mom?
Hopefully lil buddy wasn‚Äôt orphaned
Now I know why some people pick up coyotes and take them home, thinking they're stray dogs. LOL
Aww he looked hungry
It needs to learn to stay away from humans!
Omg, I'd take it home lol
Poor thing might have worms from the look of that belly. :(
Poor baby, so skinny :'(
Poor little guy, wonder where his
Mum is?
I think I gotta take u to a rehab
Rare. She/He probably lost mum.
So cute! Hopefully his mom is close by and he‚Äôs safe.
From Canada ,I have been in nature a fair bit, seen a lot of shit in the bush working ,but never this.
Obviously a trap setup up by other Coyotes, older coyotes send out their cutest member to distract passing bikers then steal the bikes while the bikers are too busy petting that cutie! /s
The voices remind me of that Charlie the Unicorn video from so many years back.  Hope the little fella didn‚Äôt have his kidney stolen.
I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm risking the hand and petting it.
Who‚Äôs going to tell him that they send the pups out to lure things back to the waiting pack
Weird that he went to you immediately...
Cute, but leave them wild and haze.
Watch your back! Momma watching.
I've never seen so much wildlife as I have the past handful of years riding bikes more frequently. 

This pup being separated from parents, not in den can't be a good thing, I'm guessing.
I knew a guy that found a coyote that was kicked out of its den or the mama died or something and bottle raised it.  That thing was never fully tamed. She would piss in the house and intentionally knock over your beer because she liked the taste. She was a good pupper and we all loved her.
‚ÄòI‚Äôve been waiting for you, fren!‚Äô
I honestly probably woulda taken it home thinking it was a dog puppy on accident
coyotes can get too friendly with humans <3
Look malnourished.  We‚Äôre you able to help it?
little guy looks kind of hungry, hope he is ok
That's a cute Lil wild pupper who will eventually eat your neighbor's outdoor cats.
\* Manly squeeing \*
Cute lil murderer
world: coyotes are dangerous, mother could be around

us people: is it for me ü§ó
Would be worried that momma was near by.
Pelt isn't worth much at that size.. see you next year
He's like hay bro, got any chickens?
I hope you culled it
Good job stopping and letting it not fear humans.
It‚Äôs cute, but it‚Äôs about to be bloody pulp once the first predator sees it.
Idiot. Shouldn't fuck with wild animals especially coyotes
Cute. Probably spent 12 hours waiting for its mom to "wake up"
I hate coyotes. I'm not sure this thing is cute enough to compensate for that.
My grandmothers home is in a very rural area and coyotes are not liked...at all. I remember one night you could hear them off in the distance and my mamaw looked deeply disturbed and said "Gosh, I hope those coyotes arent out there hurting somebody"  I assured her that nobody was being stalked and dismembered by the coyotes but I dont think she believed me.
Anyways, this curious little guy is so cute...hopefully his mother is around.
Idk about you, but I still think coyotes are assholes and should die
Coyotes be like: Deer-Wolf
Bring it home
What a curious boy!
Aw sick free puppy
Ohhhh I saw this. People in the comments were calling op "disgusting" "awful" etc. For not taking the wild pup home.
Now it probably thinks humans aren't a threat.
He saw the ACME logo on the person's shoes, and it all went downhill from there.
Aww he's gonna die.
Cull it
Dang poor guy is probably LOST! Find him a mom NOW!!! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
Aww indeed. What a cutie.

If this pup is alone it needs to be taken care of.

If it's not alone, kick it. No seriously. Not *too* hard of course. But as a wild animal it needs to learn the fear of humans in order to have a chance of survival. In that sense it's the kind thing to do.
Cute....to bad they should all die with fire.
I stalked the coyote that killed my cat. It wasn't easy. He developed a pattern and didn't know I was watching. Took six months. When I killed him, I felt zero satisfaction. To my surprise, I felt guilt. He w√†s just doing what we all do. Surviving. My cat was an inside cat and all black. She slipped out on me when it was dark . My fault. Didn't know she was out so I didn't know to let her back in. 

I've been a hunter my whole life but this was the first time I killed something I wasn't going to eat. I'm not passing judgement either. Coyotes can be a nuisance. I just regret it since it wasn't necessary.
Two years later he eats your dog
Forget about the pandemic. Worry about jackasses like this approaching animals like this. This is how you get rabies or some other virus, thinking that's its OK to approach animals like this that aren't acting normal. Coyotes are never this friendly, unless there's something wrong with them.

This type of behavior is considered cute and adorable on reddit, but you're a monster for not wanting to wear a mask or get a vaccine that hasn't been properly tested (you're the Guinea pig).

You can't make this shit up.
There are so many assholes that do hunting contests and slaughter hundreds of coyotes, foxes, bobcats. Whoever kills the most gets dumb ass prize. Their only prize should be a fucking luny bin.
Vermin
In the scenario of this Pup being an orphan and having near no chance of survival on its own - is it okay to think about taking it in your home and trying to give it a life?
r/didntknowiwantedthat. Just kidding so stinking cute but the smell is coming through the phone.
probably a coyote wolf dog hybrid thats been replacing coyotes. they get the bigger size form the wolf allowing them to take down deer, the lack of fear of humans from dogs and the nocturnal ability to hunt when we are asleep allowing them to thrive in urbanized environments. 

wild wolves dont like being near human anything and pure coyotes are on the small side to hunt adult deer.
Even my biologist ass was like... puppy!!!
Dogshit animals. They love picking off outdoor pets
At the end, I was expecting you to put a bullet in it
It's remarkable that even a puppy coyote looks nasty and not even remotely cute.
Burn it with fire
It‚Äôs a trap!!
So cute
Dog ee!!!!!
Don‚Äôt let em bite that aceeee
Nice
so curious <3 Honestly I'd be weary that the mother is near by. That little Cuteness would get me killed. :T
Wow, that‚Äôs so cool!
Sweet, free coyote
Oh my!
AWWW! It's a BAYBAY!
That‚Äôs amazingly
They always send out the cute little ones first as a decoy
Wow! I've never seen one.
Camouflage
Wow. Head huge
I've always wondered in this situation is it best to be a mean scary human and growl and stamp the ground or something so the pup doesn't get too confident in the future.
Now fulton it to mother base..
nice to see comments are working again.
Did the parents ever showed up?
OMG, so hard not to play with it I am sure. Not afraid of humans yet, but wow, awesome sight for sure.
Say hello to your mother for me‚Ä¶
One of the people talking sounds like Doug Funny.
Where‚Äôs mama? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs up
This is so adorable!! I wish the video went on longer. What happened after this??
It's adorable but I wouldn't want to be anywhere near it lol. That seems like a good way to find yourself fighting nine coyotes
Dangerous ‚Ä¶ you know that mother ain‚Äôt too far away
Gotta catch ‚Äòem all
Aw so cute. I hope there was a mama nearby.
awww thats soo cute.
What do you even do when you find one? Like is it a ‚Äútouch it and it‚Äôs mom will abandon it cause it smells like human‚Äù or a ‚Äúmom will bear growl at you for touching her tiny child‚Äù
D-DOG!
That baby probably needs some help. I hope you contacted someone to come look for a starving/lost pup...

It doesn't seem wily enough to be running around on its own and it's coat doesn't look good.
Beautiful
Usually, there is a local wildlife group you can contact to tell them you found a lone baby. 

Sometimes, they will know if there is a mom that has been around, or maybe one got hurt/killed on a nearby road. In general, they just have more information on how the situation should be handled or who to contact about it.
so fucking cool! something about seeing wild animals, mammals in particular for me, is so exciting and raw.
Cute until Coyote Mom bites your sack off.
ive never seen a baby coyote how cute haha
"i was waiting for the roadrunner, why are you here?"
Although he‚Äôs adorable, the right thing to do would have been to scare him away so he stays away from humans
It‚Äôs Dylan Guenther!
This is my first time seeing a coyote puppy. I love the way he looks, cause usually I don't like coyotes.
This looks like the same place that guy was chased by the puma? Bobcat? Wildcat of some sort.
it looks like a minecraft mob its head is huge
Animal kids can be scared too. It‚Äôs very sad to see this
The way you said rare find made me think of a Pok√©mon card opening video
He‚Äôs so curious! Absolutely adorable, but also, yes, if mom is nearby this is scary as hell.
Oh my god it‚Äôs adorable
People on Nextdoor would go nuts
I would have thought it was a dog
A quick mid biking snack
I've always sort of thought it was crazy that we became friends with wolves in ancient times but the way he just walks up to the guy with no fear makes me rethink that!
Get the fuck away from it!
I am the only one hearing pokemon encounter music at the start of the video?(also I am not sure is a good idea to go and pet him, now will think humans are ok and that is a danger for himself and humans alike).
It's looking for the road runner
It's like seeing Ted bundy as a baby. HARMLESS, for now...
Bro that‚Äôs fucking adorable
They are all over in Missouri, they have really multiplied over the last two decades l, as a kid in 80s I hardly ever seen them
So, did the mom upload this video after she ate the bikers or what?
A coyote ripped my cat in half last week. Fuck coyotes.
I wish there was open season on criminals and not animals. Just saying. Criminals are a bigger problem then any animal.
Could be a coywolf pup.
Wow . That is absolutely amazing
I‚Äôll give you 150 for him
![gif](giphy|UTkm6euG3wabBiUeQu)
that pup is so cute but also are those sperrys you‚Äôre rocking
I live just outside Providence and there is one in my neighborhood
Rare? Well I do live in the mountains in Tennessee so I guess weekly hard not to keep one as a pet doesn‚Äôt really count as rare to me
Coyotes can be brutal animals but I've always found them to be beautiful dogs as well. That little pup is too cute.
He seems really young, wonder if moms ok
So damn cute!
Good thing the mom didn‚Äôt notice you that close. Yikes. So adorable though, damn.
Completely human naive animal, you were it‚Äôs first human encounter. Soon, this behavior will go away. You were lucky to have had such a cool experience!
I really like that pup don't you know.  It's the best.
In socal this isn't uncommon. Some years the coyotes make sense in city park and don't give a shit about people.
Wow. I have one of them in my backyard. I thought it was a Fox that had mange but now I know for sure. It looks exactly like this guy.

NW NJ.
Reminds me of when I used to work at my local hospital, I used to see coyote pups walking around our pond all the time, really cute
Coyote puppies are really curious and they are not afraid of human or anything else. This make them dangerous when they grow up.
https://youtu.be/_BHxbFTk0u8
Beware of nearby parents tho
that little faceeee
the animal kingdom
 is actually so magestic it has such great animals that try to interact with humankind its just so beautiful
Then the momma comes out and shreds your face
Hes just chillin
Dude was unusually curious. Cute little guy though.
Cute now. In a year or so it's gonna be the neighborhood crackhead. Running off with your small dogs and cats.
What da dog doin?
Cute.
Theres a website for my area where you can see where coyotes have killed pets.
Well this is an awful sign we're all gonna die soon... that's good
Yeah I‚Äôd say it time to get the fuck out of that area
Omg so precious
My Rabies. Let me show you them!
I once saw a pup when I was out running by a golf course.  I immediately realized that was a bad thing. 

Mama was just around the corner and decided to follow me for about half a mile.  She was ready to attack.
Omg how cute?!?!üò±‚ô•Ô∏è
Weird doggo dude
Nice Job on reaching level 4 ranger
Kinda looks like a scrony puppy
That‚Äôs a sweet lil boi‚Ä¶ mama probably close by tho!
Gotta scare it away unfortunately. Adorable little scamp.
What did you do?
Today I learned a surprising amount of people are afraid of coyotes.
It‚Äôs a trap!!!
So cute!!!!!!!!
As if it‚Äôs a Pok√©mon. Rare coyote score!
How... do camera?
Early one morning, a few years ago, I found an elderly outside trying to catch a lost puppy.  She was sure it strayed from home and was going to get hit by a car. I'm thinking that sure looks like a coyote. I told her I would help her and ran after it yelling "here puppy puppy" really loud trying to just scare it away. When I got back to her I told her that it looks like it is going home. She says oh that's good news and was happy. She has since passed away so I am glad we tried to save a puppy together.
My dumb ass probably would have thought it was a puppy
He looks a bit mangey and thin.  Was Mom spotted nearby?  Is someone keeping an eye out to make sure he's OK?
So adorable!
It would take all my willpower to not pet it
I know what I must do, but I do not know if I have the strength to do it. That pupper would be given scritches. I don't have enough willpower to scare him off. good boi. Must pet.
I guess you aren't in Vancouver OP. Our bite if you get close to their dens.
They are rare to find in the forest alone. Usually they walk with their parents and are not that curious.
First thought: Cute!
Second thought: *Oh shit where's mom?*
We shall name him Wile. E.
Looking for mama. There‚Äôs probably more pups around there.
I will always love that young, curious, playful attitude in all creatures. No bias, no hate, no experience.
It's so cute
I would probably carefully turn around and go the other way lol, angry mama coyotes are scary
Cool
Awww take him home
fluffy pup
I seen a coyote pup one day at work
Dawg Shids at 00:12
Every single one of you know you'd stop and pet that puppy. Don't even pretend you wouldn't
Holy lord‚Ä¶ it doesn‚Äôt get more adorable than that ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏èü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è
One of these just outside our back yard today!
This would‚Äôve been on a different subreddit if in the last second you can see the mother coming at him lmao
Coyote packs will often send their young to lure housepets to a grizzly end
Congrats on your new puppy!!
Its cute now but give him a few ~~years~~ months and he will be big enough to snatch up and eat your dog or even your toddler.
I know it‚Äôs a wild anima, but I want to take it home!
Where is your pokeball?
So cuteeeee
Was 100% expecting a raptor pincer/decoy attack at the end of this.
Spiky puppy
You're deer is broken.
Sick find!
Very cute but the best thing for that little guy is to start stomping and yelling at it to scare it away. Can't let them get comfortable with humans or their survival is at risk.

But with that said AWWWWWW!!!!!!   LOL
Friendly lil pup ‚ò∫Ô∏è
is that big bird talking behind the camera?
Do we know for sure the OP is the one that got this video? I suspect this is found footage. The coyotes are learning to lure us with adorable traps.
As
Cute
Dangerous zoomies
He looks polite
I have mixed feelings. I love all animals and this little baby is so cute. 

But a big coyote ate my favorite cat cause we border a bayou -_-
It‚Äôs cute
Do you keep the yote pup, or leave it?
God dang thats one cute forbidden doggo
Why isn‚Äôt this coyote afraid of humans? I thought most wild animals would be.
he got more head than he got body
The coyote is my spirit animal, your spirit animal chooses you,  you do not choose your spirit animal.
Hwuqj
Whoa!!!
Make sure you check if it has rabies
You fool, you just rode into an ambush
It‚Äôs weird that I‚Äôve never seen a coyote pup.
Soo adorable
If I was blessed with this encounter, can I pet him?
\*a wild coyote pub appeared!\*

\*Coyote pup used cuteness!\*

\*Its Super Effective!\* 

\*You Have Fainted!\*
Why is it rare to find coyote pup? i don‚Äôt wanna google this, someone explain.
i hate when these kind of videos are too short :c
I would have picked him up and taken him home. Teach him to tell my neighborhood coyotes to stop eating my cats.
![gif](giphy|icVV8dtppSx0iOel91|downsized)
Wow.

I'm an avid hunter and outdoorsman and after seeing this video it dawned on me how little I see photos/videos of coyotes so young.

Cool video!
The first dog + man friendship probably happened just like something like this, thousands of years ago ..

GROG:    " Heyyyyyyyyy lil' buddy !!!!    how you doin ? "  :D
Watch out for the cheetah
I‚Äôm upset at the length of this video
The way the baby just trotted up to you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®ü•∞
Aww ü•∞
I would be so tempted to make It my best friend üòÇ
Damn nature! You scary!
But did you pet it???
It‚Äôs been 15-20 years but I still remember the squirrel that raced and lost his dash across the street.  I was going slow and braked the second I saw him.  Ahh that sound‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.  Got out ,took one look and being a veterinarian assistant and it being a Sunday in the middle of nowhere I took a deep breath and backed over him twice. Wrapped him in a sweatshirt and kept him the freezer till work on Monday then cremated him.  And yes as you can tell I still think about him
10/10 I'm taking him home, giving him a bath, and making a 5 michelin star dinner for him.
Too cute for a killing machine.
My 81 year old neighbor just had his little twelve year old dog carried off and eaten by a coyote. The dog was within ten feet of my friend. The Wylie bastard just came up and grabbed the poor little guy. I feel terribly for my friend. That dog was the last connection he had to his wife and Buddy made it worth while for my friend to crawl out of his sheets everyday. Im hypervigillant now when I take my  little doggie outside 
I
 All I have to do is envision that bastard with my dog in its mouth and it‚Äôs over.
Does the sound remind anybody else of that one Dave Chappelle bit?
I‚Äôd confuse this as a puppy and take it home lol
this video is too short and i'm salty about it
Why is Ryan Reynolds chasing cayotes?
I have the same look after an edible bender.....![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
That sweet pup looks like it could follow someone home!
Such a cutie. But you can't keep it, pup
Just leave it alone it was born in wild that‚Äôs where it belongs
Can y‚Äôall please please please come get all these damn coyotes here in galveston texas?! I live IN the city and saw prob 12 of them mfers ACROSS THE STREET!
Coyote pups are not a rare find unless you're in an area with a low density coyote population.
Don't engage with it
that's the cutest thing ive ever fucking seen im convinced this video could achieve world peace
What in the world?  He's alone.  He's not afraid of humans.  He's apparently looking for help.  

Aside from looking for the mother, it'd be awfully tempting to raise it.
little tiny coyote standing in the middle of road "all alone"? hmm seems like a trap for the road runner. quick, check for ACME crates!
A coyote ate my cats
I love they way they look like whey they are puppies. They are like small doggos that were found on the street.
Wonder where mama is?
Lucky lucky
Damn this road has cougars on it too watch out
Ohhhh lil bebe!!!
Poor little thing, looks scrawny. He‚Äôs so friendly.
I was driving in my favorite mountains the other day and one of these jumped up in front of my car. Almost killed the poor thing.
I severely dislike coyotes, but this‚Ä¶ is acceptable
All cute and fun till momma comes round o_o
Puppo
He is very cute
I get to see these pups at my job all the time, even had one of my coworkers send me a pic of one of the pups trying to take a shit?? Lol
don‚Äôt encourage baby wildlife to approach you/vice versa, they should not be conditioned to feel safe around humans at all, and in any case just enjoy the moment for yourself, not everything beautiful has to be shared..
that's a baby deer ,bruh
Baby goat and wolf
Forbidden pupper.
I hope they had their pokemon ball ready!
I think I‚Äôm in love
We just moved into our new home that is surrounded by bush and fields.  We have 3/4 of an acre for ourselves. 
I let our dogs out at 5:00am one day, and my Jackhole yellow lab rescue went hackles up and teeth showing after the second coyote that ran through our side yard.  It saw her and tried to entice her to come away with it, and she was well on her way to chasing it.  
I had to scream and clap and tell her to get her ass back in the house.  
Our Border Collie?  He booked it the minute he took one look at the two coyotes as they swept through our yard.  
They‚Äôre beautiful and they‚Äôre interesting to watch.  We just need to keep an eye on our dipshit lab because she could feed them for like a week.
I live in a very urban area surrounded by millions of people.  Literally.

And our neighborhood is lousy with these little fluffy critters.

They've formed a pack of sorts - 3 grown ups, 1 medium, and 4 pups this year.

Caught the medium one with the remains of a cat the other day - the spinal column attached to the limbs. Kitty paws still untouched but everything else stripped almost bare - amazing that it held together like a puppet almost.

If I throw a rock at them (to teach them to be weary of people) they come over and smell it.

I think someone has been feeding them - and the dozen or so feral cats in the area.

I can't be mad at the coyotes, really, they were here before humans dragged over a bunch of cats.

But man, there sure are a lot of them.
Poor thing... he approaches a human... that is so bad and sad!
So our back yard butts up to some woods and we get a lot of wildlife. 

Well one night we were tripping in mushrooms and decided to go out to the backyard. There is a little fort out there. It was super dark and my wife crawled into the fort. Then I shone the light in to find two dead coyote pups and a half eaten deer carcass, all frozen solid.

We couldn't get them out of there untill spring thaw because they were frozen to the ground..
 OMG sooooo cute
Omg I hope his mom is close!
Most of the time when they are friendly they have some kind of disease. Usually they are skittish. Be careful
I didn‚Äôt think I was afraid of coyotes until I went jogging early one morning and saw one running (too damn) close to me. At that point it might as well have been a lion. But that pup is suuuuuper cute.
Something happened to his family.
Vid ends too soon. $1 says mama came rushing out immediately after :o
Aww baby. Is it normal for one so young to be alone? I hope for their sake mumma is nearby and for yours they‚Äôre not haha
What the dog doing?
Awe!!
Too bad they grow up to be coyotes
Wow such rare much pupper
Stay away from wildlife,  asshole!
Big ass head lol
And that's when the attack comes. Not from the front, but from the sides. And the two other coyotes you didn't know where there.
Danger Will Robinson
New petü•∞
Is this the lady feeding the coyotes?
We frequently have coyotes in our back yard and around in general and I have never seen a baby and for some reason I‚Äôve never even imagined a small little pup like this. How stinkin cute and awesome to see!
You riding a one wheel? lol
You pick that thing up and hug it and kiss it right now!!
Wow why did you approach it‚Ä¶ fucking idiot.
The guy in this video sounds too much like Ryan Reynolds. Does Mint Mobile get reception out there in the forest?
You can‚Äôt fool me, that‚Äôs a Pok√©mon
o this is gonna be an epic pet
Where's mama at
So what does one do when you happen upon a coyote pup?
He wants your help to find his mom ):
Rare find ? Lol what is this Pok√©mon ?
Oh man !!! that is rare musta lost momma
Ok Buddy, where‚Äôs your mom?  I‚Äôd hate to see her pop out of the bushes and attack because the human was too close.
Do coyotes and dogs inter-breed?  I had a dog run through my yard the other day that looked like a cross between a feral dog and coyote.  I couldn't get my camera out fast enough to take a pic though.  I may have to put up a wildlife camera.
wow, I would have assume this was a lost dog and end up taking him home and trying to find owners. luckily i live no where near any wild coyotes... i think
I have a bear that roams that yard and let him stay but I don‚Äôt mess with totes.  They have to go.
u/paulblartfleshmall tell me this pup doesn't have some Tina after a haircut energy
Is it okay?
Omggggg the cutness
Yeah now tame and train it like a pok√©mon
And that adorable little guy will grow up to be a pet murdering complete asshole someday
It's a trap!!!
It's a trap!
At a local campground a few years back a bear cub walked into camp. Mom was gone, probably hit by a vehicle, and the cub was hungry. 

As it was early in the year, it was rather small so the camp attendant decided to *pick it up* and remove it from the park.

Well it went ape-shit and clawed and bit his face and chest. A 30 lb cub is razor sharp and very strong. 

He has some interesting scars now. Tells everyone about "the bear" that got him... just not the age of the bear.

Moral of my tale... don't touch that thing!!!
Awe..
From my limited experience, these things are usually extremely skittish around humans and for pups they can run very fast.
What happened?
It most likely lost it‚Äôs mom and is in dire straits
Walking my dog in the woods behind a dog park. She starts growling and I look up to see a pack of them with babies. They were all digging in the ground. There were large circles of dug up earth all over the place. 

They didn't even look at us. We just backed our way out.
Is that the same road the cougar chased that dude?
Please tell me this is adopted lmao
That is a small pup to be on his own; coyote kits stay with their mothers/aunts until they are basically full grown. He also displays almost no fear at all, which is not a typical coyote response. They will disappear like a ghost if they are spooked by a human.
You can tell he hasn't seen another living thing in so long.  The way he just runs up. ü•∫
LEAVE THE WILDLIFE ALONE

Gotta catch them all!!
What kind of loot did it drop?
Dad - am I an athlete?
Not loving coyotes right now. One took a little dog out of my neighbors backyard a few days ago.  The owner was standing just 20 feet away when the coyote grabbed it and ran off into the woods.  No traces of the coyote or the dog.
I get that it's cute but a small wild animal like that not afraid of humans is bad news
Yeah just walk on by. Mamma‚Äôs not too far away
While this is cute, it is a very bad idea to interact or feed wild coyotes. It teaches them that humans are either not threats, or worse, a food source. Habitualizing animals, especially ones that are known to attack people/children on occasion, is just not in the best interest of anyone or the animal.
I would die for him
Momma won‚Äôt be so nice
Is it me or it looks in rough shape?
This is like when you find D-Dog in mgs5

6 months in the future: "Guys I found this cute puppy in the woods last August so I adopted them. But for some reason as he gets older he keeps trying to drop anvils on my head and he looks really skinny, what should I do?"
You must be city folk, that is obviously a deer cubüòÜ
His name is wildly
Did you have any poke balls on you?
Gah!!! Words hard. Ears!!
