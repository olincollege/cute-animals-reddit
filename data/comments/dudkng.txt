My neighborhood opossum will love this.
you can also use plastic bins and styrofoam coolers! my mom has made a few of these

 [https://alleycatadvocates.org/communitycat-care-center/creating-winter-shelters/](https://alleycatadvocates.org/communitycat-care-center/creating-winter-shelters/)
They won't use them cause cats know when something is done for them for love.
As long as they get spayed or neutered as well. We did this in our neighborhood (the shelters were styrofoam covered in thick, UV resistant plastic). With the help of a local shelter, we trapped, fixed and released about 8 stray cats in the neighborhood. They don't reproduce and they don't allow new strays to come into the territory.

It's the best way to go.

My neighbor's big orange tom wasn't too happy he spent a night in a trap, though. Man, he was pissed at me before I let him out the next morning.

Edit: ')' so the compiler stops complaining.
Anyone else think they were subwoofer boxes at first glance?
[deleted]
The raccoons will like these too
r/upcycling would dig this
I can donate coolers if he is in SC. Probably about 10 every ~~45~~ 60 days.
The cats are still not impressed haha
This is x10000 better than the dude painting tires and calling them dog beds.
Is he taking applications to be my grandpa?
So this the guy who stole my Cooler I left in my yard huh! lol
When you have a giant hole saw, the world is a cooler.
How cold can cats even put up with? we got a cat (idk if it is a stray or not) that sleeps on our front porch bench and it is getting to like -2c at nights, and dropping quick (canada). idk maybe i'll build it a lil shelter of sorts if it keeps sticking around
bubbles dad?
Where is this guy?
That would be an awesome enclosure(s) for rabbits and guinea pigs in an outdoor run area. You could link them up with DIY tunnels like from carpets or cardboard tubes or those ones from a pet store. But often you can get free tubes from carpet stores and cut them down to size. Then you can just throw them out when they get soiled after a few days.
If the lid seal is reasonably good, I'd probably knock the hinges off, flip the whole thing over, and use the lid as the base. That way you can lift the "walls land ceiling" off real easily to clean it out.

Otherwise, this guy is a freaking hero.
This guy is cool for cats.
I love this man
This is super cool, but brings back a bad memory for me. When I was maybe 10 my 3 or 4 year old brother thought it would be cool to give our cat its own house. He put the kitten and a saucer of milk into an Igloo cooler and set it out on the porch... Closed up... In the middle of summer. I came home from playing and asked where the cat was. He was very excited to show me. You can imagine the rest.
There‚Äôs an elderly woman in my neighborhood who feeds stray cats and some of our neighbors nearly destroyed her car over it. Some people are full of love, others are heartless!! :(
People throw out coolers? My dads cooler is like 40 years old
This is a fantastic idea!! My bf and the kind gentleman next door are building stray car shelters from plywood but recycling old coolers is what I'd like them to try. What a great way to reuse and help the cats now that it's winter. Thanks for the inspiration!
If you can, get them neutered to reduce to population growth.
This is a really cool idea :)
Finally, a fleshlight in my size.
Brilliant!
As long as the same cats are also spayed and neutered this is fantastic
The birds of the world say: C‚Äômon man!
Welcoming the downvote oblivion I may suffer, even though I'm late to the party: but feral cats are the definition of an invasive, destructive species: they spread disease, propagate exponentially and destroy many native fauna such as songbirds and rodents, lizards and amphibians. Yes, they look like fuzzy cute housecats, but they are not. Sorry to rain on the parade.
About to be downvoted by stating unpopular fact.. stray cats cause more harm than good in America.  They‚Äôre an invasive species that has all but wiped out quail in my area.  Plus all kinds of other negative effects.  Feral cats =Bad.   
 https://abcbirds.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Feral-Cats-Consequences-for-Humans-and-Wildlife.pdf
This guy is awesome
He should drop the instructions on here so others can make it.
These will make stray cats even more emboldened. Just the other day I was leaving home when two cats approached me and asked what I had in my lunch bag. I said none of your business. They then proceeded to block my driveway until I gave them food.
Great idea!!!
I showed my wife and she was worried that with only one opening that the predators might be able to trap the cats inside. Does it need a back door?
It‚Äôs COOLER then I thought. Hahahahaha





I hate myself
What a **cool** Idea..
If I had an old picnic cooler that's exactly what I'd be doing for my cat! She's so grumpy about coming in the house when it gets cold out and I hate to make her miserable but I wish there was a happy medium
Not as cool as having your pet spayed or neutered.
J.J. Wentworth has some interesting hobbies. Call 877-CATS-NOW.
Darwin would not agree.
I bet the native birds love him.
A winter night at the Meowriott
I used an oversized *resin* (it has insulating properties) flower pot, reversed, with a pot saucer glued under it to insulate from the wet ground. I put an entrance and a smaller exit- I used a saw to carve two n-shaped holes, covered with fake suede fabric. I was told it needed an emergency exit so I gave it a smaller exit. I put a big piece of cloth in it for snuggle-warmth. That's how I know some animal used it. The cloth was disgarded, dragged about 2 feet away.
Cats, raccoons, rats....he shouldn‚Äôt be a  Speciesist when he‚Äôs signing the leases or he‚Äôll find him self with a law suit. 

Those chipmunks don‚Äôt fuck around with their civil rights.
These are great! Some cool cats getting some cool homes.
Very. It makes me very positive about the world that someone is taking care of others.
**put in another hole** in case the cooler gets flipped for some reason it could trap the cat inside.
[deleted]
What is used for the opening?
You can further insulate them by putting ~~old clothes, blankets, or pillows~~  straw in them.  Then take an old glass bottle with a lid, fill it with water, and microwave it without any metal parts for 2 minutes. A normal water bottle works, too. You can put the glass bottles in an old sock to make it less burn-y.
I did something similar to this... went out to check and one cat was dead frozen to the bottom....
It‚Äôs a nice sentiment but really stray cats are a plague. They are responsible for the extinction of over 60 species of birds.
Stray cats are an invasive species and they're putting multiple bird species into extinction
fabulous..
Incredible
Smartest idea
Mha harth
Pun intended?
Awesome. Thank you
I thought for a second that they were speaker boxes.?
Well done you!
Awesome human!!
That‚Äôs cool, or as I‚Äôd say... cooler than most.
What a good guy.
wow thats great! i make cardboard houses for my little fluffs and they love them. pretty sure that the stray cats will enjoy these
Esky. It‚Äôs called an esky.
That will be one cool cat
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs cooler than cool, it‚Äôs warm.
Awesome thing to do
I must be the only one thinking those looked like redneck subwoofers made from coolers.
Before reading the title I thought these were subwoofer enclosures.
I've seen cooler ones.
They look like sub woofers..
Very cool


^hahahaha ^i ^am ^funny
Thought they were sub boxes for a second
What a hero
Well hopefully it‚Äôs not cool I hope it‚Äôs warm
Where can we learn more about this man? I Googled but didn't find anything. Thank you :)
Thought he was making subwoofers hahaha
I bet they fight the squirrels for them.
:/ what does he plan to do with the cats...
there‚Äôs a cat at my campus and i‚Äôm really worried what he‚Äôs gonna do this winter
That‚Äôs one cool cat!
cool homemade subwoofer
It's actually quite warm!
Look how happy he looks wow
I bet those are super warm
... Did anyone else think for a brief moment that was Bob Barker?
Awesome idea
Men like this should be in charge of our county!!!!!!
My mom does the same thing. They love them.
The real life Bubbles...
Not very cool. That's the point.
He‚Äôs one cool cat üòé
Storage totes are another good one for creating shelters. Kitten Lady has videos on how to construct them, like [this one.](https://youtu.be/e9YYQIHx_14)
Very cool
Unfortunately, coyotes have been eating all of our stray cats.
Awesome boomer
it's better than the kitties dying in the cold streets, thank you sir.
That‚Äôs a great idea, at my wastewater plant we have 4 strays that we take care of. I‚Äôll have to hunt for coolers
Instructions? I have a cooler I'm looking to do this with.
I strive to be like this when im older.  This man could have cleaned and sold those collers but instead he made cat homes/ animal homes.  This guy is awesome
Ok boomer!
He's a cool üêà
but when cold air is blown into it, will it keep the cat cold?
what a kind heart this man has :))
This warms my heart, as well as those kittys...
Everyone liked that
We did this for a stray who lived around the house. Dunno if he used it or not but we were glad to see him every winter morning/dinner
This is brilliant. I have a ton of old styrofoam containers used for shipping vaccines that are too small to make good coolers, and  Merck/Sanofi/ Pfizer got rid of their recycling programs a few years ago. I always feel so painfully guilty about throwing them out because they can't be recycled around here. My city also has a stray cat problem. This is a win/win!
This makes my heart happy
God bless him! Really nice of him to do in his spare time üòä
Trash pandas too! They need warmth

Did you say stray rats? Yup thats gonna fetch a lot of rats.
Not all boomers are bad
It's definitely not cool, because the cats will be warm inside of their shelters during the winter.
I love the irony of what was once something to keep things cold, is now being used to keep things warm.
If he added 4 more in this picture it would be a whole lot more cooler. Ba-dum-tiss!
Does anyone have a good resource on where to find old coolers like this? Craigslist perhaps? I live in a very rural part of East Tennessee and we have anywhere between 8-12 feral cats that stay around our property at any time. There used to be an old shed that was used for their shelter in past winters but it has since been removed (family, long story) and thus I am trying to find economical methods of sheltering the cats. Any ideas are appreciated!
Aren't cats causing bird populations (the kind we need to support our ecosystem) to go extinct? Won't this just lead to more strays and more environmental damage?
He turns coolers into warmers
100k up votes yoooo
AMEOWZING
Those holes are actually larger than necessary for a cat. A cat can fit through any space that is a size of it's cool. It seems like those will leave too much room for cold air to get in.  that's really awesome idea though, I hope he's able to put some bedding in there also.
its not cool ... its warm

sry for this... shame on me
Interesting name for ice chests.
Omg he soon niceüòõ
That is a good idea I can agree with
You kind sir,  rock the cat box!
Amazing!!
Cats are an invasive species that destroy bird populations.

You want to do something good?

Let nature take its course.
Considering stray cats are a plague for ecosystems, not cool at all.
This mother fucker stole my idea! I have a cooler on my back porch with a blanket and heating pad inside for my adopted stray. And a hole in it obviously so he can get in and out. I wrapped the whole thing in a blue tarp to keep it waterproof.
Why do people love strays so much
Stray cats are harmful to the ecosystem I know your trying to be kind to them but if reality your doing far more harm then good
Ahh yes, warming stations for the neighborhood cats when they need a break from slaughtering every animal smaller than them, which, if you didn't know, is a ridiculous amount of creatures. Cats are the second most damaging species, beaten only by humans.
No pun intended
How do you keep raccoons and skunks etc from using this? I need to answer this before my folks will put this out for the roaming kitties near them.
Soon the songbird population in his neighborhood will go to zero.
Save native birds
Unpopular opinion: you are increasing the stray cat population which is bad news for the local bird population
Stray feral animals need control not comfort. Wildlife destroyers.
This jus gives stray cats a nice place to make more stray cats.
Not cool. Let the stray cats die they are horrible for the environment.
Not very. Stray cats are a menace.
Bad for the environment though
It's a neat idea if you love spreading fleas, and the smell of urine and feces all around your house in an urban area.  Nothing's worse than a bunch of stray cats around.  And I'm a cat lover.  In a more rural area where you can confine them to a specific part of your property I would be ok with doing something like this.  Especially to keep the rodents away! :D
Stray cats should be euthanized. Outside cats are worse for wildlife than prettymuch anything else
Stray cats are an environmental disaster. This isn‚Äôt as cool as it seems.
Oh sweet I can finally find a convenient place to get a frozen cat cheap
This is the least /r/aww post I have ever seen. Mods it's very simple: people visit /r/aww for pictures of cute animals. Not plastic boxes, not disabled human children, not mundane pictures with a sob story, just cute animals.
More like this man in the world would make things much better on our planet. We need to think of others both humans and animals to make our lives have meaning. Supporting each other despite our differences, rise above those fools in Washington who want us at each other's throats to make them feel superior, basically as our puppet masters. Politicians and the media are dividing us for nothing but there perceived power trips, using the media to make them relevant.
Thats stupid
Stray cats are so bad for the environment...
I have to "get rid of" the strays in my neighborhood. They're too aggressive and a nuisance.
Why would you create extra accommodation for an invasive species that devastated local animal populations?
I bet the local wildlife is thrilled that their invasive predators will survive the winter.
Terrible.  Feral cats are an ecological nightmare.
The local ecosystems love him.
Because feral cat colonies are soo cute...
Feral cats are a problem for local species and this dude is helping escalate that problem
Except for the birds
Cats should be brought and kept indoors. If I were to find these, they would be taken to the nearest dumpster.
My neighbor used to do this.  All the stray cats would shit in everyone's gardens and yards, then reproduce and create even more stray cats, most of whom would still starve every winter or get hit by cars.
Outdoor cats are terrible for the environment and wreck native wildlife populations. It‚Äôs better to trap and euthanize.
fuck cats. Make homes for people for the winter.
Yes! Enable the success of the second most destructive invasive species behind mankind! This isn‚Äôt a kindly old man, this is Cobra Commander! MWAHAHAHAHA!!!
Stray cats are awful for the environment and are better off ded. Im not unethical or anything, same goes for humans.
Stray cats aren't cute for wildlife
This is a good way to obliterate any remaining native wildlife in the area. Strays should be trapped and taken out of the environment (and either adopted or euthanized), not allowed to persist as destructive colonies.
It's cool till your neighborhood is filled with these and the raccoons have taken over
Will be downvoted for this but:

* stray cats are extremely dangerous to the enviroment and have already caused massive shifts due to having eliminated several avian species.

* they cause a spread of fleas wich end up hurting household pets.

* they are likely to be carriers of taxoplasmosis and thus a danger to humans.

* Unregulated breeding combined with no natural predators make them a disruptive organism.
I see what you did there, those recycled COOLers are indeed very COOL
Now I‚Äôm no scientist but isn‚Äôt the purpose of a cooler to keep things cold? Would this not just trap cold air in it and keep it that temperature?
Stray/feral cats should be collected and given up for adoption or culled, not enabled like this.
With gas chambers........
Shit I thought those were some DIWhy subwoofer boxes.
I love this. What kind of tool is he using?
Totally thought these were cooler subs for your trunk.
Those coolers looked perfectly fine to me
Another quiet hero.
Looked like subwoofer enclosures.
That will make one hell of a glory hole.
Gotta love Walker County. Say hi to big sam for me!
Thought those were speaker enclosures at first
Thought this chap had made a bunch of custom subwoofer installs.  All about that bass, no treble.
Well done, sir!!!
Always wondered what the rest of the world called Eskys
Dang
Good on ya buddy!
Hopefully not *too* cool
Keep him alive. He has raygun.
Oh. It is good idea.
The first time I saw this it didn't have a description on what he was doing with them and thought they were for subwoofers. What a good guy!
So awesome üëç
It keeps them warm in the winter, until he forgets which cooler has the cat and which one has the drinks and dumps ice on him
Haha very *cool* indeed
Cat Fact: They will bang in these.
How cool is this? This is way cool!  Even... wicked cool!  Genius idea, really and good for him.
How well does one of these insolate heat?
Idk wat I was thinking but tbh , my first thought was that he was making speaker boxes out of them ( just a bass junkie ig lol). Still now I wonder how that would turn. Anyways awesome job saving the kitties n such. Rock on.
This is pretty nice but maybe hebcould put a mesh on the threshold?
I mean, they are less cool than they used to be...
Make sure to check them once in a while, I made one but they do get water in them when it rains..it can sit under the hay and not appear full. Going to add some plastic to seal it off this winter üëçüèæ
From cold in warm to warm in cold
That‚Äôs very *cool.*
Good boomer

What an amazing individual more people like this need recognition god bless
It's warm instead
I live in zona now so there are so manny more strays then when I lived in Minnesota. My question is what makes the cat go into a small tube at night? Food? Does that usually work? I‚Äôm just curious because I‚Äôve fed so many of them and have seen two... which is two to many dead ones since I‚Äôve been here for the past few months. I‚Äôd like to join

Sometimes you just need an excuse to buy a giant hole saw.

"i'll figure something out!"

Missed opportunity for bubbles here
A few friends order those weekly meal deliveries, and they end up sending an obscene amount of insulation to keep produce cool in transit.

Concepts like this could be a good outlet for re-use if people can source weatherproof enclosures.
That hole saw looks like it could break your arm.
El presador?
That's pretty cool I guess. Not as cool as the B2 Spirit stealth bomber though.
Yeah go Boomer

My Boomer dad usually makes things to carry 4-5 giant bags of recycling 

Go boomers
Keeps them fresh!
PICK A NICK BASKETS
The thumbnail, at first glance, looked like subwoofer enclosurs.
Internet is suddenly swarming with stray cat housing posts. I know there e is a mess in NYC and Philly.  Is it really that much of a problem elsewhere?
Out animal rescue used to make this out of large plastic bins and styrofoam coolers.  Put styrofoam cooler inside plastic bin: cut round hole thru both.  Fill with straw and then duct tape on lid.
Saw this on a fb page in my area, cool!
I thought these were subwoofers for a sec
This is amaaaaaazing!!!
+respect
this is probably trying to settle some argument with his wife over why he needed to spend $100+ on a drill bit
I thought they were subs at first glance lol
Ha, get it? It‚Äôs cool.
I‚Äôm currently doing this with Rubbermaid bins. Anyone know what he‚Äôs using around the hole?
Skill - Cooler Engineering
Level - Picnic!
That‚Äôs actually genius because coolers are good at insulating and it‚Äôll block wind as well. Add some cheap blankets in there and the kitties will be super warm.
I want to be him when ƒ± get old
Thought this was Alex Trebek.
Or he's gonna store them in there over the winter ready to turn them into pie?
Wouldn‚Äôt that smell really bad? Even if you do clean it in and out
i thought he is recycling them into subwoofers
For anyone wanting to build shelters for outdoor kitties, this site has a good tutorial.

https://alleycatadvocates.org/communitycat-care-center/creating-winter-shelters/
Thats grandad energy
Aren't they isolated with aspestos tho? At least the older ones a.k.a. the ones he will most likely use?
this will make for some very Cool cats :D
These look like Fleshlights for elephants. Ok maybe not for African elephants.
Now I'm thinking about collecting old refrigerators and putting cat trees inside...
Killer idea‚Äô
That hole saw has gotta be $45-50.
Is this in Pittsburgh? Saw somebody selling a similar version there
r/dontputyourdickinthat
Ok Boomer.
Then when the hole closes up you have food for next winter
Call J.G. Wentworth 877-CASH-NOW!

Wont they just go sleep in the cardboard boxes people throw away instead?
Okay, who‚Äôs property will these ‚Äúshelters‚Äù sit on? Most home owners don‚Äôt want stay animals roaming around and they damn sure don‚Äôt want a throwaway cooler on their property üòÜ
Wholesome post OP I hope he drops a YouTube tutorial
Those are pretty neat, I didn‚Äôt know this but if cats can find a dry place out of the wind in the winter they can pretty much stay warm through out the night with their fur
Love this idea!  I assume he puts the stray inside to keep them comfy cozy
Most expensive part of this setup is the hole saw. Awesome idea and a good way to gather them up for adoption.
Hopefully, not very.
Eh, I think he just wanted to use that drill bit
I want to know where this man finds old coolers? I have had the same one since the 90s!! Do people really get rid of them! ;)
r/tihi

Let's cats = better
Why would you want to keep the cats cold during winter, cruel if you ask me !
When I first saw these I thought they were speakers he put in the coolers! Reminds me of this project I made back in college lol:
https://youtu.be/n1rONsrmfmg
Igloo igloos
How do you keep raccoons from taking it over?
Not cool at all, and isn't that the point?
I‚Äôm sure the comment is here somewhere, but just in case:
Shelters need to have an entrance and an exit for escape. If a cat were to be in here it‚Äôd get cornered immediately either by another cat or animal (dog, coyote, other small/medium sized predators). While the cooler is kind of small for two holes it is definitely a necessity for the cat to use it and be comfortable at the same time.
just a man, a drill, and a dream
I hope it‚Äôs not too cool, or the shelter won‚Äôt help much.


I‚Äôll see myself out
On a practical level:  what is that awesome round tool thing on his drill???  Many of us who make cat shelters out of totes or other stuff need to buy them them before we cut our fingers off with the box cutters we use (first you soften the plastic with a hair dryer.)
This idea is cold as ice
I don't know why but I kept reading the title as picnic scooters and was just mind blown that people would these that. I should probably go to bed.
Very well intentioned idea. Not necessarily great in practice.
It‚Äôs not just cool - it‚Äôs picnic cool!
The nan gets through his fair share of coolers that's for sure!
Guy could make a killing making horse dong sized glory holes.

But is it igloo cool?
Not cool at all. And that's the point.
I have a cat that has lived in my backyard for 3 Canadian wingers in something like this
I thought these were subwoofer coolers at first
The attachment for that drill is called a "hole saw" if anyone wants to try that.
Wouldn't they freeze inside a cooler? r/nodumbquestions
Maybe weird question but... if coolers are designed to hold coldness well then won‚Äôt putting them out in winter mean the inside will get cold and hold it for a long time?
Who calls them picnic coolers anymore?
Damn
Who wanna sleep in a fridge during winter? The cats will freeze!
Oh yeah, put the cats in a cooler in the middle of winter. Thanks jerk. /s
Trash panda approves ü¶ù
Ok this is epic

They need a separate entrance and exit so they don't act as cat traps for predators.
Those are some cool warm coolers.
I thought from just the picture, he was adding subwoofers to the coolers.
Damn I thought these were subwoofer boxes
Ok cooler
Definitely thought he was making some speaker boxes out of coolers.

That would have been pretty chill.
At first I thought he was making them into boom boxes.
Well thats not useful. You don‚Äôt want your cats cooler in the winter. You want them warmer.
Or is it just an elaborate cat trap?
Those coolers look perfectly fine to me. What a waste.
I totally thought those were DIY bass speakers at first glance lol. Happy little cat shelters!
Now just need to make one for Dirty Mike and the Boys.

Thought he was making subwoofer enclosures. Good on him
I only see glory holes for cats

Are you sure he's not making sub boxes for Honda's?
he's straight up from a wholesome Pixar movie

It's actually going to be very warm...
Actually the point is that it isn't cool at all. He wants the cats to be warm after all

I've read that you should put 2 holes in any shelter.
Gives cat an opportunity to escape if a predator were to come around.
No no no this‚Äôll just keep them cold
Recycled coolers? It's not like a cooler wears out. Who throws away a cooler?
Only if he‚Äôs getting them spayed and neutered. Let‚Äôs never forget Bob Barker.
That‚Äôs a $150+ hole saw, damn. Those things aren‚Äôt cheap at that size.
I have a similar one purchased from Etsy. Our cats won't use it.
Looks like a portable glory hole
Trap the food
This may be a dumb question, but aren't coolers meant to keep things cold?
First glance I thought this old man was pimpin' out coolers with subwoofers!  But very wholesome
Picnic cooler? Those are esky's, mate...
Idk man. I could‚Äôve used those!
I thought they were sub woofer boxes made out of coolers at first glance. I think I have an ideaü§î
he's drilling a big hole in $20-40 coolers and putting some pipe insulation around the hole
Those look like they‚Äôre in pretty good shape still. Wish he woulda recycled them to me instead of those ungrateful feral cats 1/2/s
ok boomer
That‚Äôs cool but I could use an old cooler... to use as a cooler.
All I see are glory holes for horses.
That is a huge hole saw.
Who is he? Does anyone have an article on him? My resources are limited at the moment.
Is there a way to contact him for a DIY/How-To? I wonder if there is anything specific he is doing to help with insulation
Jokes on you, the man‚Äôs in North Korea. 

Dinner‚Äôs served baby
But if it‚Äôs cold outside... wouldn‚Äôt the cooler make the cat cold! I‚Äôm so confused. üò©
Lol for a sec I thought those where coolers with subwoofer built in
It' not cool. It's cooler
That hole saw was not cheap...
*Damn I thought it was subwoofer enclosures*
I hope he put 2 holes in each one. I learned that stray cats won't go inside of something unless they have more than one way out
Way cooler than it was before
Aren‚Äôt you supposed to have two holes so they have a way out when something unsavory sticks it‚Äôs head in one of the holes?

What if a Jehovah‚Äôs Witness corner is it?
Just showing off his 6‚Äù hole saw.
My dumbass thought they were speakers
Gotta keep that cat meat nice and cool
Raccoons*
Does he provide any info on what all he does to them? I would love to do this and have a 6" hole saw rearing to go. I think we may even have a cooler! I know of at least one neighborhood kitty who frequents our yard cause of all of our cats and I'd feel alot better knowing he had a better place to go then under our gazebo to Duke it out with the opossums, raccoons , and bunnies that frequent it...
I thought those were subwoofers at first.
I honestly thought the man was making subwoofers out of old coolers.
I thought he was making subwoofers at first
Soooo. You just cut a hole in a perfectly good beer cooler... fucking boomers man I tell yeah, no respect.
I thought he‚Äôs making home made subwoofers before I read the title.
So if it was really could, these would actually keep the cats cool and ^^^fresh right? Is this actually snack saving technology?
Plot twist:  glory holes for infants.
I, too, purchased a large hole saw for one project and constantly look for opportunities to justify its cost.
*into fleshlights for giants!
Not that cool anymore - there's a hole in them
*chilly bin
I‚Äôve seen these all around the Chinese restaurants in my area.
Or maybe the cats should be treated the same as dogs... wouldnt have this problem if it wasnt for stupid people
Won't that keep the cats cold??
Now add a door so you can trap and spay them.  Way too many strays and they keep breeding.
Those be some good mash tuns
Fenwick?
That's a one friendly neighborhood boomer.
Looks like he has a Fallout gamma gun too
He looks like a cross between George bush and Charlton Heston
Ever notice how nobody goes on picnics anymore?
Coolers are more expensive than other materials. Why would you do that. Fr. Use wood planks. Use cardboard boxes or plastic bins. Sell the coolers- I want a cooler. Give me multiple. I'll take them all. What a waste.

Photo of old man posing with coolers. Is this /r/pics? Thought this sub was for cute picture not cute stories.
Cooler to stay warm... How ironic
That‚Äôs a big ass hole saw.
Nice speakers
Very, very cool!
Won't this just make more stray cats
Pretty cooler
Es un crack
I did this one year but the damn coolers turned out to not be water tight. What a disappointment.
You are an ANGEL. And what a great idea!
Can we get diy instructions, please?
My local cat cafe offers a discount for donating coolers that get made into these by a non-proffit that turns them into shelters and places them where they are needed.
Does anyone know who this man is? I would love to message him and find out what he uses to make these. I wouldn't mind making a few
That‚Äôs so holesome REEEEE
Very cool! Especially on winter! Aaaahhhhh.... hello? Is anyone still here? Fine I'll stop.
*Reusing, recycling is the process of turning something into raw materials. These 2 are not interchangeable
That‚Äôs fucking awesome!
They each need a flap in the back for an escape route.
I am sure the millions of birds that are dead will appreciate this.
I love that circle hole drill bit!
Pretty cool idea but in my experience, the kids are not watertight.  I have left coolers like these outside many times and they always end up full of water.  But kudos to the old guy for doing something.
I thought he turned them into subwoofer boxes for a split second....
It would be nice if there was a door of some sort to keep the cold out and the cat's body heat in.  It would have to be jam proof because we don't want them getting trapped.  Maybe some fibers, plastic or rubber that could hang over the opening?   
or maybe a simple hinge that works with gravity (no springs) and can swing in or out.   For heat maybe a few car batteries and some solar panels with a timer to go on and off at fixed intervals and some low voltage heating pads that cannot get too hot.  Do cats need heat? or would blankets be enough?
Before I read the caption, I thought for sure it was an old guy making cooler subwoofers lol
Amazing! I've been worried about a little feral kitten I've been feeding since summer (she was caught,spayed and re-released).  She only shows up to eat late at night, and sometimes she hangs out in a little "cave" I made for her from a cat crate and some boxes/blankets. It has been ok for cold Fall nights but in the winter it gets down to freezing in our area. Was wondering what to do short of capturing her, which she would hate.  The cooler conversion is such a good idea!
"How very warm\* is this?!"  
\*ftfy.
Very _cool_ indeed. Pun intended
r/dontputyourdickinthere
Good man.
Cat-man-do
Just want to be careful to have a one or two additional doors as well, maybe loosely covered with plastic to block the wind a bit.

That way, if something tips the cooler over, the kitty/animal can still get out safely.

Also as an escape from a predator.
I thought those were turned into speakers....
Keeps those cats crisp
racoons gonna fuck this up
It‚Äôs cute but that hole saw is skookum as frig!
Bob Barker is freaking tireless in the pursuit of animal rights.
Oh sure, when he puts cats in coolers he's a "hero" and "thoughtful" but when I do it I'm a "monster" and "eating someone's pet"
At first glance I thought they were subwoofers
They look way better then the ones we did as a kid
Not very cool, obviously.
I made a cat shelter for a stray that I always saw around. It was about winter out and I felt bad for her and her two babies. Then spring rolled around and I had a dozen feral cats that eventually ran the nice cat out of town. Waking up to cat fights outside your window can be terrifying. I'm a cat man, if rather have a cat than a dog, but this is a bad idea coming from personal experience. It's all good if you are putting these things somewhere where a high population of non friendly cats is a good thing then go for it. But once you are overpopulated you are left few options. Exterminate, move to another location or  capture neuter and release.
Apparently very cool since you know, old coolers.
Ah the 4th R; Repurpose
r/humansbeingsbros
That's not cool, that's warm
Cool idea in principle, however the nation already faces a great feral cat problem. The solution isn‚Äôt to provide shelter, it‚Äôs to reduce their numbers humanely and to sterilize your house cats.
Compassionat loving person!
brilliant!
Old coolers? Those look in tip top shape what do you call worn out coolers?
That man is JG WENTWORTH
This will make a good place for the cats to eat the birds that they catch.
ITT: More than I ever wanted to know about the social habits of possums.

Can we get back to praising the righteous dude who builds kitty shelters?
Plot twist: He starting a war with an army of cats
I thought it was subwoofers at first glance, lol.
They look like glory holes for black guys.
He‚Äôs awesome
We have the dumbest man alive and beetlejuice
Soundproofing cases for bitcoin miners can also be made the same way.
This is a great way to help feral cat populations that decimate wildlife populations. This should not be celebrated.
 it looks like a kick ass speaker system he was creating
I love that someone is doing this thank you
This guy have a go fund me?
This is so wholesome, he looks so happy with his drill thing!
It‚Äôs a real life bubbles. Just without the goofy glasses and the greasy side gigs
Forbidden glory holes.
He looks like lazarbeams dad
And a ray gun? This guy is cool
Anyone got a link on how to make these?
This may be an unfavorable opinion, but I don‚Äôt think people should house and feed stray cats.  Where I live, backyards touch and neighbors share fences with surrounding yards. One neighbor feeding outside cats creates a colony of cats that is then shared with the entire block. That means stray cats pooping and peeing in your yard with no way of making them leave.   It‚Äôs an environmental hazard in my opinion.
God bless this man!
Mmmm food in a cage
Not very cool at all! Those would have been great fucking coolers... What an asshole. Fuck cats.
Bless you
I found some kitties behind my work today.. literally used a cooler and some rags for a shelter for them this morning and then saw this... hats off good sir
I'd very much like to give him a hug
When you make kitty houses, be sure to add two holes. in case they need to escape!
you‚Äôve made my day
That's cool in many levels.
They looked like some diwhy subwoofers for a second
I thought these were subwoofers in a cooler for a second there
This can not be any cooller
At first I thought they were sub-woofers, but now I see they are sub^^^zero
-meowers.
I need one for a neighborhood cat here in NY
That man is a saint!  Where is he located?  I have a few old coolers I could donate to the cause...
That's amazing üòç
If I had a hole saw that massive I would find any reason to use it too
Unpopular opinion but I think stray cats should be humanely put down. They are absolutely destructive to bird populations.
When grandpa forgets what he was doing in the garage but makes up an excuse so nobody puts him in a home
It's important to have two holes at opposite ends so if a wild animal corners the cat inside, it can still escape out the other side.
Thank u boomer
Cats are decimating the bird population in North America though and it‚Äôs becoming a big issue
Houses with sunroof
 VERY AWESOME!
He‚Äôs cool, but the shelters are coolers
