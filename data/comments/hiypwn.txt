The chill is real!
This is my goal in life right now
I know I could never achieve this level of chill.
LMFAO he actually doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge you it‚Äôs hilarious
Love when he bops the red ball and pays it no mind and just keeps floating along
‚ÄúJust because it‚Äôs a ball doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt have better things to do Chad‚Äù - Dog
That is one calm ass pup lol I want to be him
The dog days of summer
I want to see how he gets on the noodles.
I'm just waiting for someone to say "actually this dog is extremely terrified and lays upon these pool noodles in defeat, believing they will drown at any instant." There's always one
;; I can barely get in one pool noodle. How the heck did he get on 4??
Can I join him?
And on the seventh day Dog rested
I love him
So peaceful. When my life gets to a point like this I start inventing problems.
Would love to see footage of him/her getting on those noodles!
"Bro relax, I am literally just vibing right now"
Looking like royalty!
Do dogs pee in the pool the same as kids?
How do you get a dog to do this? Like do you set up the noodles first and they jump on? Or do you have to just put them under it one at a time?
Wowwwww... I hate being human
"What are ya doin'?"

"Just noodlin' around..."

Love it!
My dog immediately freaks out and goes for the exit, he hates baths and pools
This made my day! Thank you!!!
Boat dog
The zen of this doggo
Yay, boy looks so peaceful!
My lab would spend the day rotating between jumping into our pool to swim laps and chill, and sunning himself dry in the hot sun.

People have meditated their entire lives and only gotten to a fraction of this level of Zen.
How did you get your doggy into this position?

Okay, so did the doggo do this himself, or was he helped by a human? Super impressive either way.

Aahhh!! What is in doggo‚Äôs mind is beyond me! After 2 seconds of this RELAX will be me itching and twitching already!! Sigh I need help!
Is this doggo even awake or is he just that chill
I love his rudder.
Just a little poot and watch him speed up.
Can we just show this to everyone en masse?  2020 needs to chill out
Damn I need that kind of energy
He was any more chill he would icicles hanging off his nose!

This is clearly supposed to be some kind of abstract dog protest.

Have you perhaps switched to a healthier brand of dog food recently?
i almost drowned my self by putting floaties on my feet and jumping in
Wish I could be this dog right now.
I wish my life wasnt full of crippling anxiety, poverty and physical strain on my body and I could live a life where I could watch my dog in a pool.

I spent $50 on Lyft to get to and from work today, so I made like $18 and I hurt all over. I'm so envious of this bliss. I just want it to all end.
A life to aspire to!

I‚Äôm impressed by the dogs ability to wrangle pool noodles without being bipedal enough to stand on the bottom of the pool, coral the noods, and climb on and chill...

Or to be out of the pool and see all four noods lined up perfectly for the 5star dog splash on all four noodles off the top rope

It‚Äôs the face. I‚Äôm dying.
so how many treats did this dog get bribed with in order to perch on the pool noodles like that?? I mean dogs are well behaved but i gather treats were involved some way or another.
My arse plays chess.
The dog obviously didn't get on them like that himself, so why you shove pool noodles under your pooch for points?
i hope you thanked the essential workers who got you the chemicals to open the pool
