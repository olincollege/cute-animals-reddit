Be careful... My cousins dog had to get over 20 stitches in her stomach because a deer saw her as a threat and stomped her.
Such a thin line between r/aww and r/natureismetal.

Seriously, be careful. A single deer can absolutely fuck up any common dog or cat.
Careful with kitty. That city cat may not know to be terrified if foxes, coyotes, etc. Take mittens in at night.
Pretty certain that is the first cat that deer has ever seen, too
It occurred to me that the deer might be moving its head side to side because deer among other similar animals have much better side to side sight than straight ahead site.
This is now your Deer meeting your Cat for the first time... plus love the way they both look at you for like what the buggery is this going on here right now
Don't allow this. My cat Zach got kicked in the face by a deer and now has severe issues with his sinuses and jaw.
Since a pretty common separator between carnivores (predators) and herbivores (prey) in the terrestrial animal kingdom is the location of the eyes (predators on the front of the face for better range finding ability, prey on the sides of their head for better width of visible area), I wonder if animals have a general sense of if they should flee or chase when seeing something they've never encountered before.

&#x200B;

Like in this case is the deer thinking "Hmm. Has the build of something I should run away from but it's so *tiny!*"
I‚Äôd be wary of that deer around a cat, they have been known to stomp cats around their fawns
That cats lucky it didn‚Äôt see it as a threat‚Ä¶. Yet.
Op, dont let your dog or cat approach wildlife like that. One second the deer might be interested, the other second hes head butting and stomping the shit out of the cat/dog/whatever. Dont fuck with wildlife, they look cute and innocent until they suddenly arent
I love that they‚Äôre both curious about what they‚Äôre looking at, but they don‚Äôt know how exactly to approach each other.
I feel like a large number of people are unaware of how dangerous deer can be, and are stuck on the whole Bambi vibe.

Deer are big, can be surprisingly mean, and their hooves are very sharp. They can go from Awww, to pissed off knife tornado really fast.
Careful having your cat outside. I'm not even in a rural area, but outdoor cats primarily serve as snacks for coyotes and raptors.
Be careful. Deer stomp out smaller creatures.
I was raised in a rural location. Keep your cat inside if you aren't supervising it. Otherwise it'll just be something's meal one day, especially if it wasn't raised out there
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not backing down to this weird looking dog.!‚Äù
Is fren?
 CUte video, but if you love your cat, make it an indoor cat now that you live in the country or it‚Äôs going to become somethings dinner.  I would be devastated if that happened and I don‚Äôt even know you.

Please, read the comments, don‚Äôt let that cat out anymore, not in the wild.
Now your cat has ticks.
Your cat is going to get eaten by a coyote. Keep it inside.
Probably should never allow this to happen again.
My neighbour had 2 dashounds. Same size as this cat. One startled a deer and the deer kicked it, and gored the tiny pup. The poor thing was eviscerated. Now my neighbour has one dashound.
Deer can be majestic... but Lyme disease is no joke.  Check for ticks.
I‚Äôd be real careful with that. Deer have fairly sharp hooves and can kick hard. If it feels threatened it could take out your cat
I honestly think that if it were possible for a cat and a whale to meet, the cat would not bat a fucking eye and maybe simply slap at the whale. Cats are fearless.
"What the fuck ARE you?" "What the fuck are *you*?!"
Very cute! And just a mention to maybe put a bell on your putters if you let it be free range. They are hunters by nature and will decimate bird nests without you knowing a thing is going on. Enjoy the wild (:

Deer aren't always so friendly - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADGn1GABF0Q
If you are new to rural areas, just a tip to keep your cat inside at night. If type let them out during the day there is still a chance that an animal can hurt them, but they are in more danger at night. Since you have deer so close already, it‚Äôs not a stretch to consider other wild animals that may be carnivores are close by and see your cat as an easy target.
Please don't let your cat run loose. There are coyotes around.
The cat glancing back at you for a second before turning his attention to the deer again makes it a truly r/youseeingthisshit worthy post
Looks like this is the first cat the deer has come across too lol.
I would take that cat inside to stay inside.. lots of things out in rural areas that prey on cats.
Aww and that Buck is getting his antlers!
Do not encourage this. A deer can seriously hurt your cat.
Please keep your cat in the house.
Be careful... My cousins dog had to get over 20 stitches in her stomach because a deer saw her as a threat and stomped her.
This was pretty dangerous and stupid, OP.
This cat isn't going to last long in this environment if op thinks this is cute
I love the ‚ÄúAre you seeing this shit?‚Äù looks they both give the camera.
FOLK GANG
Trying to get it killed?
This is very dumb to do if you care for the safety of your pet.
Cat: the fuck are you?

Deer: the FUCK are you!??!?
[deleted]
Thank you for not adding shit music to the clip.
How did it end?
Cat: I want to eat it but it's too big.  
Deer: Is the predator far away or just really small?
I like how they regard each other carefully, and then look to you for an explanation.
"What the heck is you?"
"What the heck is YOU?"
They both have ‚ÄúDa fuq?‚Äù tail.
The way they both look at u like 'are u seeing what I'm seeing?' lol x
They both look at you like ‚Äúare you frickin‚Äô seeing this right now?!‚Äù
Eh, cats are fast as fuck I bet there is nothing to be worried about op. Loved how they both looked at you in a concerned way seeing how you were reacting. Animals are cool.
Looks like ‚ÄúLand of the Giants‚Äù
All I think about when I see deer is the ticks they carry. So many ticks.
They are both adorably confused.
I hope you keep your cat supervised. There are lots of coyotes in the rural places.
If it's a city cat you might want to keep him inside. They usually don't do well in rural areas.
That‚Äôs how you get your pet fucked up.
I love how they keep looking at the cameraman like "you seeing this shit?"
I'll be waiting for the follow up post on r/cats when this person is crying that a wild animal killed their poor cat.  Then they tell us they let it outside a bunch.
The cat: "You looking at this hooman?"
Equal parts curious and potentially murderous.
"The fuck are you?"

"The fuck are YOU?"
Keep your cat indoors, also be careful, deer can stomp on cats if they're aggressive
[removed]
I don't think you really understand just how bad that deer can fuck your cat up, and will.

Edit: ok seeing you replied about being ready to sprint to save üêà maybe you do!
r/youseeingthisshit
If you hear birds nearby, prepare for that to stop within a week or two if you have an outdoor cat.
Reminder that cats need to be kept indoors and not roam freely outside.
I think it‚Äôs the first time a deer has seen a cat too
Actually it is more like the deer is meeting a Cat for the first time
You guys are so lucky. You have deer, all cute and friendly. In Australia we have spiders the size of a dinner plate, that gallop erratically  towards you to say hi! 

And then we have kangaroos that literally drown dogs and will punch you for looking at them wrong! You can literally google man punches kangaroo, and find a guy defending his dog, as he and the kangeroo box!!
Just be careful, sometimes deer eat rats, mice and birds.
Like a curious dog with longer legs.
[deleted]
When it comes to mating season, keep that cat away from the deer.
Is that deer going to eat that cat?
The deer looks so huge. ü¶åü¶åü¶å
be careful of lice
That‚Äôs so cute. Depending on where you are you have to be careful. We have lots of deer here too but we have other critters that would snack on kitties.
You have a cute kitty
Your cat took its soul right after the video ended, huh?
They both lookin at the camera like o.0
Or..this is a deer seeing your cat for the first time? Lol
I think you meant to say that‚Äôs the deers first time seeing a cat! What beautiful animals.
Well, I think this is adorable. After a long day of work, watching a real life Disney movie works for me! I hope they become friends.
The deer is probably trying to figure out why this creature that kind of looks like an apex predator is so tiny.
When they both look at the camera at the same time
The cat staring at the camera in the end "You seeing this"
I swear they were having a conversation.
r/youseeingthisshit
I went to visit a friend in Pennsylvania. He had a five pound red cat he named 'Coppertop'.

Early morning we're sitting on his back porch drinking coffee, and he looks at me, says very quietly "shush" and nods behind me.

I turned slowly, and there was a deer, making it's way down the treeline, munching a leaf here and there.

We watched as the deer got closer, and l noticed the closer it got, the more alert it appeared; like it smelled or heard something it didn't like. 

When it was only a few yards from the porch, Coppertop burst out from beneath the bushes and charged the deer.

The deer panicked and ran, quickly leaving the tiny cat behind. 

Coppertop returned to the porch, sat down beside us, and let out a hugh sigh. Then looked up at us like "dammit, almost got him."
The cat keeps looking at the camera like "you seeing this shit?"
Enjoy your fleas OP.
One time I got really drunk and ran over a deer. 


_A deer, deer friend._
this is also a deer seeing a cat for the first time
Last few seconds of the vid, your cat looks at the camera like do you see this sh*t?! üò©üòÇ
Best thing I‚Äôve seen in like a month probably
The buck doesn‚Äôt know what to make of cats.
Friend or foe?
‚ÄúWell THAT‚ÄôS a weird looking doggy!‚Äù Said the deer.
More like your deer seeing a cat for the first time
Doesn‚Äôt anyone see the cat breaking the 4th wall ! He looks straight at the camera like ‚Äú are you seeing this shit ?‚Äù
I wonder how the cat can instantly tell that the deer is not a major threat. I'm sure for example a dog of the size would trigger a very different reaction.

Has any research been done into this? As an avid /r/HFY reader obviously the eye position is a big giveaway (prey has eyes on the sides to see more, predators - humans included - on the front to better see their prey). Teeth probably too. But I wonder what hints the cat actually reacts to.
Why is the deer still in velvet? Should‚Äôve shedded months ago right?
It‚Äôs weird that puppies aren‚Äôt likely to survive the same trauma if it were to kittens
Edit:I‚Äôm a veterinary nurse and I see kittens survive far worse than puppies do
It also looks like it‚Äôs the first time the deer saw a cat
This may be the first time when this deer sees a cat.
‚ÄúWhoa‚Ä¶what are you dude?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a deer‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that a human‚Äù

‚ÄúOh yeah man, that‚Äôs my human, he‚Äôs good people‚Äù

‚ÄúOh okay, cool‚Äù 

I was literally narrating that as I was watching. So cute.
This is a deer seeing your cat for the first time. I like how it is moving its head around probably for depth perception, but I like to believe the deer was moving head to the right... and to the left... "yep I think it's looking at me. Whatever it is..."
At the end: ‚Äú‚Ä¶Dude, wtf?‚Äù
Quit playin this is a Disney movie
That is a beautiful cat
This is amazing you caught this interaction on video. They are so dang curious about each other.
I like when the cat does the ‚Äúare you seeing this shit?!?!?!‚Äù look over towards the camera.
‚ÄúOh hello‚Äù 


‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶hi‚Äù


‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it up there?‚Äù


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cool I guess. And down there?‚Äù


‚ÄúNot bad‚Äù 


‚ÄúNice. Um okay well‚Ä¶I‚Äôm gonna go‚Ä¶‚Äù 



‚ÄúWait! Can I get a sniff?‚Äù


‚ÄúWould do it‚Äôs just you look like a smaller version of the thing that ate my mom‚Ä¶‚Äù


‚ÄúI completely understand. What about from here?‚Äù


‚ÄúYeah I‚Äôll sniff from here.‚Äù


‚ÄúAwesome have a great day.‚Äù


‚ÄúK bye‚Äù
Assuming you come from a city... Was the move worth it?
Of course it's the r/tortie they seem to have no fear and are queen of all they see!  The house panther is being a perfect ninja.
Deer are very curious animals. If you are running a chainsaw they will come look to see what you are doing.
Might be the deers 1st time too.
*Yesterday I saw a deer. If you solve this next test, maybe I'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room, and I'll tell you about the time I saw a deer again.*
Reminds me of the old Loony Tunes where Sylvester sees the baby kangaroo
I love how they're both like *"Wtf are you???"*
And apparently that is a deer seeing a cat for the first time
If that deer made one false move, kitty would be on the roof in a fraction of a second. (or back under the porch, less than a meter away.)

I can see a curious dog getting itself stomped on, but a cat? Not likely.
"Greetings, tiny apex predator!"
Did you give them the nod? They both looked over for it
It also looks like a deer seeing a cat for the first time
I‚Äôm glad the deer was docile or this could have ended quite badly.
Looks more like deer sees my cat for the first time
The way the cat looks back to the OP at the end lol "Can ya believe this shit Dave?"
Cat looking at the camera: "Are you freakin' seeing this thing?"
"Where in hell have you taken us, Janet?"
I like this Disney film!
"You seeing this sh\*t hooman?" - Both of them at different times :D
Cats like.. ‚Äúyou getting this?‚Äù
"oh dear"
This is a cute way to start the day, TY OP!
That "are you seeing this shit" look back at you in the middle of the video though.  LOL!!
"See my range yo? I'm all over the place yo"
This is so beautiful
Looks more like a deer seeing a cat for the first time
My prey looks a lot bigger than it should be.
They are both so confused ahaha
Invest in a tick collar and other assortments if you want your city cat outside for long periods of time. Deers are pretty and all but they‚Äôre also carrying ticks that can transfer diseases to other animals and even people.
Why did they both look over at you like "You seein' this shit?"
That babe has probably never seen a cat either.
Looks more like your deer is seeing a cat for the first time.
can they stop being shy and just cuddle together :D please
Deers first time seeing a cat, too? That head bob is a questioning one‚Ä¶

Side note: also love the end‚Ä¶ the cat looks at the humans like, ‚Äúyou seeing this s*** too, right?‚Äù
This is my deer seeing a cat for the first time
I live in rural Colorado, and my property is well populated with deer.  I don‚Äôt let my dogs or cats anywhere near them unless there is a fence between them. They‚Äôre cute, but they‚Äôre still wild animals.
I love how they keep looking at the cameraman
Aww. 1st time my young cat saw a deer, they both got spooked and ran off in opposite directions üòÖ
Looks like a first for both
That deer doesn‚Äôt stand a chance
Judging by the wooliness of that buck..it's going to be a very cold winter where you are.
A lot of people are saying how deers can be physically dangerous and to be careful, also keep in mind that deers often have ticks on them, make sure the kitty is ok!
cat looks back like ‚Äúparent, what I do?‚Äù 
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
They both kept looking over to the camera like "Gary, are you seeing this thing?"
I think this might be the first this deer has seen a cat as well üòÇ
Deer: Thats a weird looking deer‚Ä¶
And a deer seeing cat first time.
Cat and Deer seem both like... 'you gonna step in here or what'.
I love how both of them just kept looking at each other and then back at you like "Is this okay? What is this weird lookin thing?" üòπüòπ
![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote) S I L V E R ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
Why this video isn't longest üò≠
Thats hilarious when they both look at the camera like "wtf am I supposed to do with this?" lol
I‚Äôm more surprised at how close that deer is to y‚Äôall and dosent care.
‚ÄòAre you friendly?‚Äô
‚ÄòAre YOU FRIENDLY..?‚Äô
The deer reaction is classic when she looks straight into the camera. Just thinking the cat was not giving the usual cat greeting of hissing and growling‚Ä¶ that deer would have been off in a flash!
That is so adorable , I love that cats reaction it was so curious
How the heck did this get 106K + upvotes?
Looks like a deer seeing a cat for the first time too.
‚ÄúWhat do I do, Dave?‚Äù
Deer looks so big compared to cat lol
Lol both animals are like ‚ÄúWtf??‚Äù
He thinking DAM! That a big mouse! He
I like when the cat looks at the camera like ‚Äúdude get this on video‚Äù
Alllllllright, all these posts about deer stomping cats and dogs are really making me want to go deer hunting. I've been hesitant, but no, not anymore.
my old golden ‚Äú‚ÄùBuster‚Äù would always greet the deer and they would be indifferent to whether he was there or not because he was so calm cant say the same for my terrier the little devil was cute and fiesty but didn‚Äôt know wat animals to leave alone luckily buster wouldn‚Äôt let him get clole too the deer  though  wow I miss that dog
OP in this thread: I have one rule- if the sun isn‚Äôt out, neither are they.
Keep your cat inside.
How do you like the move? Been living in a city for about 25 years now. Over it!
i‚Äôm surprised the deer didn‚Äôt curb stomp your cat thankfully.
r/videosthatendtoosoon
Deer: "Hey, look, I know you're a carnivore/predator and I'm an herbivore/prey, but I'm pretty sure I could take you in a fight.  Let's just both be cool, eh?"
I love how they both keep looking at the camera/human lol
The ear flapping says it all.
You will find a dead deer in your house tomorrow and the cat will be looking very pleased with itself
It‚Äôs like neither of them knows what the heck the other is lol.
The cat definitely looked at the camera like, ‚Äúyou seein‚Äô this shit?!‚Äù
Now put a quarter sized jeep next to it and you‚Äôve got yourself a safari!
Deer looks like he's thinking, "Yep...no matter the angle I look, this thing looks shady af.
Well what fucking happened?!? I need to know!!
Lol they both look back like ‚Äúyou seeing this shit?‚Äù üòÇüòÇ
I honestly think my boy Lemmiwinks would contemplate an attack, then realize it‚Äôs kinda dumb and really big‚Ä¶ good for protection against the things he‚Äôs not quite big enough to fight. My cat would bring this new friend to our house to be our new pet as he has done w other animals.
The deer doesn‚Äôt know what to do with the cat lol ‚ÄúYou appear to be a hunter but I‚Äôm strangely unafraid‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúUghhh is it a predator?‚Äù

-both cat and deer
Cat: What are you, beautiful, mythical creature? 0.0

Deer: oh crap  its one of those fat squirrels with the claws...kind of a cute one though. -\_\_-
Deers carry lime Denise
OP, for your cat's sake, keep the damn cat inside before you post the next sob story on reddit that you're so sad your precious baby died horribly because you let whatever wild animals find them when you're not looking.
I wonder if OP knows how close they got to filming their cat getting stomped out of existence
I always love these videos bc I love animals but I always hate being that person who says don‚Äôt let your cats outside for too long, they can really harm the local ecosystem
Wanted to see a nose boop.
Next he scape, finds the next neighbour cat and that is how you start a feral cat population that will extint a bunch of reptiles and birds, keep your cats inside, its not that hard.
Bring your fucking cat inside if you give a shit about it.
at the end;  
Cat: okay seriously wtf is this?
Both are beautiful!
‚ÄúI understand you probably don‚Äôt realize this, but in fact you are on my favorite patch of grass. I‚Äôm being nice about this.‚Äù
love the "are you seeing this shit?" look from the deer.
Cat: "Dad! If I catch it, can I eat it?"

Deer: "City slicker"
I love the deer just noddin side to side like "wtf is that thing??"
I've been on /r/natureismetal too much, I thought "oh no that cat is going to get eaten!"
When your cat looked back at the camera he said ‚ÄúDo you see this shit?‚Äù
Amazing. Loved the glance to the human.
I love how both of them keep looking at the camera like "dafuq is this thing".
His stare back of approval makes it.
Years ago I walked outside and my cat (who passed a couple years ago) was touching noses with a deer so I watched them and finally when they noticed, the deer ran off and my cat ran up to me and started kissing me like I didn't see him cheating on me. RIP DUDE üò≠
Your cat is absolutely gorgeous!  She is so beautiful!  I have lots of deer where I am, and my cat Riley stalks them. He looks like a smaller version of a mountain lion - he has the same shoulder motion, hunches down doing the stalking thing, and the deer run from him.  It‚Äôs really funny to watch.
This is not cute sorry but you‚Äôre cat could easily get a stomping a die from that deer, irresponsible to say the least stop thinking all nature lives in harmony.
How about fuck your cat.
Carnivore meets herbivore. There is no trust.
[deleted]
Run deer! He will steal your soul!
Sniff sniff
bigger than i thought
Looks like the deers first time meeting a cat.
That deer seems pretty big compared to the ones I used to have in my backyard.  I thought maybe it was just because the cat looked tiny, but even covering him up that deer looks huge.
looks they vibing ngl
Deer be like: Mountain lion, nope mountain little. We'll be frens.

Long ago we rented a house on a 2-4 acre forested property. Deer everywhere. One momma and her two fawns would sit outside our dining room window.

Our cat would sit on the window ledge growling at the strange intruders, but never went out the open window.
Seems like a tame deer. I'm in a rural spot and we have a squad that h as s been raised as babies continually and released by a very good hearted neighbor. They are super quiet too, I've been scared by them many times our at night with the dog and turn around and you have 4 deer on your ass wanting a potato chip.

Still an awesome vid. I love when did animals get along
‚ÄúUmmmmm Daryl? There‚Äôs really big cats here! Horned cats! meow!‚Äù
at the end, Cat clearly said "WTF is that John?"
Iz tiger, but smol. Fren??
"So uh, wanna be friends?"    "ok sure"
Cat: ‚ÄúDamn they grow dogs big out here.‚Äù
Is the little black kitty yours too?  It's not nearly as brave as the calico, the little dear!
cat's like r/youseeingthisshit
What happened at the end? Did they just split there separate ways or did one of them scare the other away? I must know!
I like how the cat looks over like, ‚Äúyou seeing this shit?‚Äù
Literally everyone involved has never seen any of this before ü•∞
That deer is so confused.  It has primal instincts telling it it's facing a predator, but other parts are like, "but it's so small!"
My neighbors once saw my cat outside with a fox, chasing eachother.
The deer is like, ‚ÄúIs this thing yours?!?‚Äù
Now hug!
I moved to a rural location this march. Difference is I'm in Australia. 

Sadly no video, but my cat encountered a kangaroo for the first time recently. 

If you can imagine  a cosseted, calm tabby suddenly leap up and have all four legs try to run in different directions at once, you've pretty much got it. 

&#x200B;

poor cat - all her life she'd dreamed of giant meece and then she saw the neares thing to one!
0:27 - 0:30
r/youseeingthisshit
Deer: WTAF you smell like a predator but you're tiny *head snaps up to look at camera* Am I being pranked right now!?
They are so curious about each other
Deer‚Äôs like haell nawh
"That's the biggest fuckin' cat I've ever seen!" -Mittens
both animals look directly to camera like "you seeing this shit?"
Aww look how happy he is!
I like how the Deer is definitely afraid of the cat, the cat is like, ‚ÄúWTF us this gentle monster?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not backing down to this weird looking dog.!‚Äù
Did we just become best friends
Cat: "What *are* you?"

Deer: "What are *you*?"
I live in the suburbs and had a deer almost the same size end up in my backyard, over my 6' fence and at my back sliding glass door. Upon seeing it my cats tore ass through the house and hid for half a day.
r/youseeingthisshit
Big doggy
damm this is some adorable  Disney shit
Trying to decide if it was real when I noticed the second cat...
Garden protection is only achieved with an 8-foot tall woven wire fence.  With an Electric Fence at 2 levels.  Unfortunately, Bambi can jump over 9 feet.  Your mileage may vary!
This is nice.
Awww, this is adorable. I was hoping we'd get to see them boop snoots!
While this is super cute, uhm that‚Äôs either a big ass deer or a weird angle
‚ÄúWhy are you so smol?‚Äù
That‚Äôs neat. I like it.
How sweet is that. They‚Äôll be good friends :)
I think your cat might be a Disney princess.
Your cat is like, "that's a big cat."
The deer is like, "KILLER!"
Your cat is a Disney princess now
"I want to run away but I am so curious"

"I want to run away but I am so curious"

"I want to run away but I am so curious"

"Who are you? Oh human! Whenever I see no harm came out of it."

"I am so curious - what are you?"
0:10 the fuck?
This is so cute :)
I like how both the cat and the deer look at you like saying, "human, the hell is this thing? "
Cat:  Friend or foe?!!

Deer:  I was just going to ask you the same!
It‚Äôs crazy how much an animal‚Äôs hunter or prey mentality affects them. Even with the huge size difference here, the deer has a prey mentality, and the cat has a hunter mentality, and you can totally tell based on their body language
I love how they looked at the camera one after another and then back at each otherüòÇüòÇ
Oh that‚Äôs so cool! I hope I can settle down in a rural area one day (\*\^‚ñΩ\^\*)
I‚Äôm confused on ‚Äúrural‚Äù if you can stand 10ft from a deer and video it.
Last week I was standing in my driveway, chatting with my wife, and we looked to the end of our street and there were a half dozen or more deer just hanging out in the street.  We watched them for a bit and then they all parted ways and moved on into the surrounding yards.  Emerging from the crowd I saw this white blob swaying back and forth and realized it was heading toward me.  A few seconds later I recognized it as my fat cat Ollie, who rarely leaves the porch.  I think he was the meeting organizer.
Criminally short video.
The only calculus that cat is doing is how to take that dear down and eat it. They‚Äôre just little psychopathic  murderers.
The cat probably thinks ‚Äúwhat strange looking dogs we have here in the country‚Äù
"that's a weird big ass dog" :)
I like that the deers tail starts wagging like a dog
Make sure to fence in your yard or get a cat leash, your cat can die really easily in rural areas, even herbivores stomp smaller animals. Deer can and do attack people and other animals when they're scared. And on top of that is the carnivores like bears, mountain lions, wolves, and coyotes.

And on the other side are all of the smaller animals your cat can end up killing for sport that can also attract predators and lower local bird and rodent populations.
keep your fucking cat inside
That's a weird dog.
I mean, its cute, but I cant help but feel this is just wildly irresponsible pet ownership
Keep your cats inside
Keep your cat inside, and certainly never let it get near wild animals.
Why is your cat outside without a leash?
I wanted so bad for them both to boop their noses together
where'd you move to? if its near me fuck you for buying houses I cant find one near my parents.
That's cute how curious they both are. üòÖ
Fresh Schnoodle, love it! ‚ù§
I hope they become best friends
I wish this video were so much longer haha
You can cut the sexual tension with a knife
Both animals seem to be slowly reassuring themselves that they don't inhabit the same branch of the food chain.
They are both thinking ‚Äúwhat kind of dog is that?‚Äù
Very shocking
So how did it end between them?
"Ms kitty, I am not a sparrow"  "nearly 25 of my friends & I go through this yard every day" "so deal with it!
Jesus that things got sonar domes for ears
Better make sure it‚Äôs not a bobcat!
Your cat is huge
It‚Äôs like a gamer and an NPC becoming conscious and meeting
"mother, I cannot hunt this mouse. I shall begrudgingly make friends"
12!!!!!!
Deer seems like he desperately wants to be curious and playful but his survival instinct is screaming GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW!
The tree in the background fucks up the perspective. At first look I thought that was a moose and made that cat look big.
Also looks like it‚Äôs the deers first time seeing a cat.
What‚Äôs the thing doin ova der?
Deer looked over like "Hey, can I pet this?"
Deer are the physical embodiment of endless curiosity
Idk why but this looked totally CGI at first
Deer: "Hey ma!!"
Pictured: two introverts trying to start a conversation
Is it just me or the deer is trying to talk to the cat.
The cat: the animatronics on this thing sucks
'yo, you seeing this shit, bob? Look at that fucking giant cat!'
whoah, this gave me chills. nature man.
"Hello giant weird dog."
Anybody else hear the Blake Webber ‚Äúwhat the fuck is that fucking thing?‚Äù
Poor dear deer can't focus.
Pretty sure that‚Äôs the first time that deer‚Äôs seen a cat too.
Now boop!
Are you seeing this shit?!?!?
Your cat looked at you like, omg are you seeing this?!
"why is this panther so small...do I be afraid of her???"
This is exactly how my greyhound interacts with my cat. Especially the look that pleads for the human to come retrieve the cat, as it is causing anxiety.
At the end the cat's like "you seein' this shit?"
‚ÄúAre you seeing this?!‚Äù
I imagine the Jurassic Park theme playing in the cat‚Äôs head.
That cat is definitely trying to figure out how it can eat that deer.
Look at that tail going. How cute.
"That is one big rat."
r/youseeingthisshit
He just not seeing, he must have felt instinctively, he could take on the big animal for a different taste.
The deer acted more like a cat than your cat did.
r/youseeingthisshit
That deer could stomp that cat and break a few bones quite easily
Cat: " damn, that is one weird looking huge cat."

Deer: "damn, that is one bizarre tiny deer."

Very cute. I love how curious they both are about one another!
Oops!
The deer is seeing a kitty for the first time as well!!
Every time I see a cat and a deer in a video, I automatically think of cranbrook deer
Love this!
Are deer tail wags similar to dog tail wags?
This is the first thing to make me smile all day. It‚Äôs been a bad one.Thank you for this!
Love how they both look at the camera like "you seein' this shit?!".
i want that cat
They are both looking at the camera like they are putting you on. I bet the cat has been sneaking out for years and is trying to hide it. They might even already know each other. 

Highly suspicious that cat.
Totally adorable lol
How I expected the cat to react: NO PRISONERS! FOR THE EMPEROR!

How the cat reacted: Heh heh tall boy. Long man Jenkins.
Dawwwww! ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Omg. How big are the mice out here, and they have Horns! What are these, demon mice?!?"
That‚Äôs a big cat!
They both kept looking over like‚Ä¶is this ok? This is ok‚Ä¶? 

Such sweet souls
 Doesn‚Äôt look like the deer has seen a helluva lotta cats before, either.
I recently moved this year. It was long ago. One could almost say, the present.
I love how the cat just looks at the camera for a second and is like, "What have you gotten me into now?"
Rural life in general is bananas. It‚Äôs weird not being scared of other humans, its the thin line between you and nature. I personally love it, don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd feel if i moved there as an adult for the first time though. There‚Äôs a young buck that does this huffing thing (multiple ‚Äòscoff‚Äô noises) at night right beside my side door. Idk if it‚Äôs a mating call or ‚Äòuh-if-you-think-about-walking-past-your-driveway-I‚Äôm-gonna-fuck-you-up‚Äô call. Anybody know what that‚Äôs about?
i think the deer is more confused than the cat
How do you do, fellow cat.
The deer has a better swerve than mike Tyson
This is how MMA fights usually begin too‚Ä¶
Deer:  "That's the oddest-looking raccoon!"
This is also the deer seeing a cat for the first time! ‚ù§
OH DEER
You can tell how much your cat loves you based on how he/she keeps looking back at you during all this.
What a cute little buck! I hope he grows up to be magnificent some day!

Yeah I know he could still be dangerous to poor kitty (I'd be afraid if hera was to have such an encounter)
Sooo.... Much... Kibble...!
deer: hooman are you seeing this ...?

cat: slave are you seeing this ...?
"That's a strange looking dog right there"
I'm thinking that's the first time that deer's  been up on a cat before?
"Well, it has a predator's eyes, but it's small, like a rabbit." ~confused deer
Car was evaluating whether that would be zoo big of a prey, or if she could handle it.
12
"Wow that's a tiny mountain lion!"
Deer is like:

HhhMmmm I should go‚Ä¶

Awwww but he‚Äôs so cute!

But‚Ä¶ awwww.. no‚Ä¶. Awwww‚Ä¶
What did you film this with?
Also watch out for ticks and lime disease. Not sure how bad that effects cats but its worth a caution
And this is a deer seeing a cat for the first time
Beautiful
Dear. "Uh, hey."
Cat. "Uh, hey."
Dear. "Uh, what do we do here?"
Cat. "Idk, what do think we do here? "
Dear. "Uhh."
Cat. "Uhh."
*Cat looks at camera*
Cat: Do you see this shit?
*Looks back at camera*
Cat: We don‚Äôt have these back in the city
Both the cat and deer were clearly having trouble seeing the cue cards. They kept looking over but remained silent throughout. OP May want to move closer next time cause deer can‚Äôt see there lines that well and kitty clearly can‚Äôt read either.
That cat should be therapist.
more like deer seeing cat for first time
I was tense watching this hah
That deer is trying to bewitch your cat
Careful... I know it's usually with dogs but a deer came after my very friendly and curious golden retriever and I had to scream to get it away
Southern hemisphere?
Cat be like, ‚ÄúShit.  The mice are huge in this neck of the woods!‚Äù
Hey, i think ur pretty neat, and i respect ur distancd
Who is king of the castle now deer
CAT: CAN I TAKE THIS SHIT DOWN?!!

DEER: IS THIS SHIT GUNNA TRY JUMP ME??!!
Looks like for Deer also its first time seeing a cat
That‚Äôs your deer seeing your car for the first time too
They'll be best buddies in a few weeks....
Looks like it is the deer‚Äôs first time seeing a cat!
Its like seeing an alien to them
That look he keeps giving you.

'Where the hell have you brought me? The dogs out here are Weird!'
I like how near the end both of them look at you likevthey both trying to say, "are you seeing this shit?"
What was this filmed on? Incredible quality
I love how they both look at you like "are you seeing this tiny/gigantic thing?"
This cat is thinking, "Are you seeing this Karen? I thought you were ugly but just look at this creature!"
Bad idea kitty
Something tells me it‚Äôs the deers first time seeing a cat!
You mean the deer is seeing a cat for the first time!?
I‚Äôd guess that‚Äôs the first cat that deer has ever seen too!
"What in the fuck are you?"

"I'm cat."
What are you? 

*What are YOU?!*


HEY MA, YOU SEEIN THIS SHIT OVER HERE?!
That could progress from r/aww to r/natureismetal quite rapidly.
Have they become friends
Young buck and Doja cat meeting for first time.
Dad? Mom? What is this?
Cats, striking fear into any animal they look at (the deer be like "what to I do with this thing")
Mine would immediately attack it
What camera and lens did you use for this clip?
Looks like a deer seeing a cat for the first time as well.
How‚Äôd it turn out?
It‚Äôs all cute until the deer decides to start stomping‚Ä¶.
The scaling of this video is throwing me off. That deer looks taller than a house.
Hello.

Hi.

What kind of mammal are you?

Hoofed ruminant. What about you?

Carnivore, the Felidae variety.

Oh...

You're too big for me to eat though.
That deer has head movement of a prime Ali. I‚Äôd get the cat away from it.
i think this is more ‚Äúdeer sees cat for first time‚Äù
That cat's thinking " OK there's no way in hell I can eat this thing, but I feel like I'm supposed to... ..now what?
0:28

"What? What are you looking over there for?"
What species of deer is this?
They‚Äôre both like ‚Äòwha da fukkk‚Äô :0
‚ÄúDo you see how tall this dog is?! It‚Äôs like 1/2 legs!‚Äù
You have tiny tress. Or very large deer in your rural area.
Man that shit was beautiful
He's like "are you seeing this? No for real, check this fella out".
i moved further back in the boonies as well this year and most i've seen is an odd guinea hen or overly neighborly dogs.
That deer looks beautiful
Food?

The deer probably.
‚ÄúWhat are you?‚Äù , ‚ÄúI dunno man I‚Äôm tryna figure you out too‚Äù.
When I moved to America and my cat saw a deer, it tried to attack her.
So she *coughed* at him and he an away.
The Jurassic park theme is basically what was going on In your cats head
Did they boop?
Adorable fleabags
i could watch this forever <3
And that's how I got Lyme
"That's a weird lookin' dog."
They both are curious after looking each other
My favorite part is when both the cat and the deer are asking the cameraman to back off.
this video ended too soon!
sweet encounter
That deer can stomp over that cat
I love how the deer seems just as interested in the cat.
What is this Beast!
I see this deer went to the Crocodile Dundee School for greeting techniques
Ohh deer!
It looks like there's a second, slightly-more-scaredy cat underneath the wood pile that pokes his head out for a quick look at about 00:28!
This looks more like a deer seeing a cat for the first time.

The cats just thinking, I can take you.
Deer: oh my. So this is the legendary Catecoin $Cate

Cat: yeah so what if i am the legendary Catecoin. I bought this
"So what are we supposed to do now?"
It's like seeing aliens
Deer are omnivores
Awww, a new friend.
I also believe it's this deer's first time seeing a cat lol
u seeing this dave?
I love how they both look back at you like, ‚Äúare you seeing this?‚Äù
Deer lord
My cat saw grass for the first time and wouldn't step on it.. Circumvent it anyway possible.. I then realized the ground in my old place was covered with paving blocks!
How long have you been feeding the deer?
Man that cat is eyeballing you.

'Where in ..the gd...tarnation did you bring me!?
Don't fall to the cuteness of a deer. I bet they think that Cat is a threat to them.
So cute! they keep their distance to stay safe)
Thinking this is the first time this Deer has seen a Cat also!
And are we just going to ignore the black cat poking its head out?
üò≤ Be careful male deer can be very dangerous for your cat. Because it can attack your cat impulsively.
Umm.. ohkay you are big... But I'm superior ohk?
The cat is like you seeing this shit! Lol
Cue Blake Webber
Where is this??
This is obviously staged, you can see them both looking right at the camera in the end!
I love that ‚Äúare you seeing this shit‚Äù glance.
The cat is like 'Man the mice are HUGE here'!
[the good 'ol days](https://youtu.be/RR1FQU-deC8)
Thought the cat was gonna Walter white stay out of my territory that deer
When I lived in Germany, deer used to come on to our lawn every winter.  Our cat, a total bottle baby, used to watch them through our living room picture window, "bark" at them, and try to stalk them.  No way were we letting him out to hunt deer, but he was convinced he could catch and eat one.
Definitely has got some r/youseeingthisshit
my aunts cat went nose to nose with a young deer in her backyard!
the tiny horns are so cute D:
That‚Äôs a buck
IT REEKS OF SULFUR
Saw a video of a deer munching on a rabbit. Watch out so your cat don't get eaten.
The camera is so good, it looks animated
The cat looking at you as if to say ‚Äúare you seeing this??‚Äù
Pretty dilute calico baby!
Turns to her owner like "u seein this shit?"

That deer would make Mike Tyson miss punches. Damn!
Cat bout to get clapped
Never seen a cat so Big and a deer so small
By the looks of both of them this was the first time that deer has seen a cat too
Oh my godddd this is so freaking adorable
Looks like it‚Äôs deer‚Äôs first time too
...and the deer is seeing a cat for the first time, apparently.
Cat: "what is this thing?"

Deer: "what is this thing?"

It's been told that curiosity kills the cat. Be careful little homie. üê±
