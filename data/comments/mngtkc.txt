What kinda monkey is that?
*you got games on your phone?*
It's the golden snub-nosed monkey. Also, the original imgur source has an extra video for us! [https://imgur.com/gallery/nodyDSK](https://imgur.com/gallery/nodyDSK)

 Edit: another redditor, [u/SkeeterFlynch](https://www.reddit.com/u/SkeeterFlynch/), found a youtube channel for a guy with these monkeys. [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtsuOpJ7e6ASb66QmVoPGJQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtsuOpJ7e6ASb66QmVoPGJQ)
Yo wut that monkey looks like a premium soft toy!
Y’all think this is cute, but I know a mob shakedown when I see one. Notice how he’s throwing his hands up, as if to say “You *want* to fight? Then give me more.” as his friends walk by, presumably to do the same to other small snack owners.
Reminds me of the monkey from His Dark Materials
That's definitely a person in a monkey costume
I absolutely love this creature
If you were to just see his face, he looks straight out of a horror movie with that Voldemort nose,  but since he's fluffy and has a round belly, he's cute.
"I swear to monkey God, if you say, 'got your nose' one more time, I'm am going to throw shit at you until my shoulder gives out."
He's like a real life Pokemon.
Am I the only one that thought of Marisa Coulters daemon from his dark materials when I saw this monkey?
Ewok
100% what William Shatner saw on the wing of the plane
The Golden Snub Nose Monkey.

They only live in a relatively small area in China and there are only about 8,000 to 15,000 of them left in the wild.
Does it ever stop, or does the guy just spend the rest of his life feeding the Ewok?
Ed Sheeran's let himself go during Lockdown.
That’s a very pretty monke
His movements make me nervous
*Is that your daemon?*
Kinda reminds me of the Gorons from legend of zelda
The worst part is every time I see a cool new animal and go read it's Wikipedia page, they are all in danger of going extinct.
It looks surreal
So y'all are just creating new monkeys and thinking we wont notice now
When I was in high-school, my buddies and I essentially trained the monkeys to give us high fives or fist bumps thru the fence in exchange for crackers. 

To the point where they could recognize us and immediately point to their fists and run to the fence.
Most of you can't see danger even when it's right in front of your face. That monkey has a scary body language, he's throwing threats after every snack... And he's ripped as fuck..
Ewoks are real??
What generation pokemon is that
I've been to a monkey refuge for former pets, and those are some of the neediest creatures imaginable. They literally cry and throw a fit if you ignore them or try to put them down, they would just keep jumping on me and trying to hold my hand and such. Twas a strange but overall positive experience I suppose
That is an *incredible* looking animal. I can scarcely believe it's real.
Cute fella!
Me at Costco when the sample lady has something good
“You got any games on your phone?”
This is a monkey in a monkey costume.
I dont believe what I'm seeing. What the heck. Thats right out of an anime or something. Holy shit the colour of it.
It looks like hes going to give you a hug after every treat
I didn’t know my 1yo was actually a monkey
u/savevideo
I didn't know EWOKs actually existed. Yub nub my dude.
Monkeys are evil
Skeletor got beastman pregnant and now has beastman aids thanks a lot Novak... what will he do next
No nose skull face in movies: villain

Add some fuzzy: adorable
Is he putting his arms out for a hug or is he all like "bro come at me?"

Instructions unclear so I'm just gonna say dangerously huggable.
These monkeys used to freak me out because of the way their nose looks, but this little guy has really changed my image of them. Goodbye skull-monkey, hello chubby cutie pie!! 😍
What kind of dog is that?
Looks like a fluffy ghoul. 

"What's the matter No-Hair? Never see a Monkey before?"
He looks real but cgi at the same time
What the fuck is that thing??
Monke

This guy clearly wants a hug and you just keep giving him munchies.  Not cool
Put on a little weight since he was on His Dark Materials..
He's definitely one of the boys
Primates creep me out
I just wanna hug and squeeze him.
All I can see is Ewok.
Any other Zelda fans reminded of a Goron?
hes just munchin 🥺
Poor Leno
I love it. I will call it Little Man, regardless of its gender. I will collect them and call them all Little Man. Together they will form my band of Merry Little Men. They will do my bidding and cause crime throughout the world.
I want to give it a hug so bad but a damn well know the adorable little fucker would tear out my jugular and run off with my snacky treats.

Might still be worth it though.
Like almost every other primate humans have of course forced these little guys to the brink of extinction. Sad that we are going to be responsible for the extinction of almost every animal, because we are such awful creatures and a scourge on this planet.
His, "oh shit that's dope," body language is the best.
Weren't snub nosed monkeys recently discovered? They already have them around tourists getting fat...
Looks creepy af
Monke
#M O N K E
This is so wrong on so many levels! Golden Snub-nosed Monkeys live in the mountains of Japan and are endangered!! Why tf are people feeding them and why is this one on a sidewalk??? I wish we could report these abusive videos and get them removed.
is this monke?
This monkey has better hair than me lol I ain’t even mad
He’s like my friends, they empty my fridge when they visit. :/
Stop the Planet of the Apes, I Want to Get Off
Do these things get obnoxious like those deer in Japan if you don't feed them?
Don't feed the Ewoks, Luke.
More like awwdly terrifying.
When I started watching I first thought "That's some cool augmented reality shit right there" before realizing it was an actual monkey.
Juggernaut

This guy looks like a small furry human
Man, look at his fat little belly.  So round!
OMG, it's PuppyMonkeyBaby
Is that what a Pokémon looks like in real life?
Is that an Ewok?!
Thats a kid a suit right?
u/urfavefilipina
Ewoks are real!??
My dumb ass keeps registering that he's approaching for  a hug.  
Definitely how I'd loose my nose if I encounter one of these.
Dude, that is totally a real life Ewok...
All I see is an Ewok
damn, didn't realize Ewoks are real
The how to guide for kidnapping monkeys 🐒 😋
What I find most interesting to think about is if his bipedalism helps him get more “treats” than the other monkeys in the background.
what Pokémon is that
I don’t know what he is but I love him
He looks like some sort of magical creature! How is that thing even real!??
This will be a meme on @wsb in like 5 min
That's the fucking cutest thing I ever saw
How did you get this video of me?
I mean, sure, "aww", at first...but what happens when the snacks run out and then the wee anthropoid disembowels you from the genitals to throat and dances furiously on your upper intestines?
I didn’t know Ewoks were real
What is this and where do I get one
Michael Jackson reincarnated as an Ewok. He's so floofy!
I can here james woods finding candy when i watch this.
How are these not for sale on Amazon??????
Monke
I've never seen this kind of primate, it doesn't look real, it looks like an augmented reality character.
Looks like Teddy Ruxpin lol
What the hell is even that?
Wow I have never seen this kind before
That's a fukin EWOK!
What the fuck is that?
I think this is my new favorite animal. It looks like a Pokémon.
That's the cutest/creepiest animal I've seen!
If I saw this walking around in the jungle I’d be telling everyone that I saw a baby Bigfoot! 

If I saw him walking around a sidewalk accepting food from people I’d probably try to hug it cuz god damn it if this little guy isn’t the cutest
Is that a live stuffed animal
Whatchu got on my 40, homie?


Second video he looks like a batmonkeybear.
That is a Pokémon.
What fucking planet is this and can I visit
I want an Ewok!
Return to monke
Cute, right up until you stop feeding it and suddenly that adorable face reveals the canines.
Wait, monkeys get free snacks?

Looks like you found my dæmon.

New pokemon just dropped.

This would be the kid who asks if you have games on your phone
I know it's from Earth, but you could tell me that thing is not from Earth and I would believe you.
He looks like a monkey wearing a monkey costume.
Just hug him cmon
Mrs. Coulter's dæmon has put on weight.
Now I have 2 types of monkeys I have to hug before I die
It’s beautiful, I’ve been watching this for hours now
He looks very polite
He looks like a kid asking if you got any games on your phone 😂
Almost looks fake. It's so odd looking. But I wanna squeeze him.
I am the lorax I speak for the snacks
*...where is that daemon's human?*
First time ever seeing one of these. I was like......that's a pretty good costume
I remember researching snub-nosed monkeys on my wikipedia binges over 10 years ago. I recognized this rare specimen instantly. **Unfortunately, there are only a few thousand left.**
When did God drop the Ewok update
What planet is this?
Is this fully grown ?
Beast Titan looks smaller than I expected
“Yo you got a cigarette? No? How about a dollar you got a dollar?”
The first time I scrolled passed this, this morning, I immediately thought it was the Real Life Doodles sub because of the eyes, nose and mouth!
Im 23 and still seeing new animals. Makes me realize I dont knkw even half of the life that makes up this globe
You shouldn’t feed wildlife...
What Ewok is this??
Cursed teddy bear
Hmm, I found my next pet.
What is that pokemon, and what region is it from?
That’s an alien straight up.
This looks like something from the starwars universe. Giving me big ewok vibes but also some uncanny valley??
It’s got the body shape of Kong.
Is this a Star Wars prop!?
Damn Ms Coulter’s daemon put on some weight!
Beast Titan as a kid
Beast titan is smaller than I expected
Is dis even a real creature? 😍😍😍😍😍
Ewoks are real?
Don't wanna be there when you run out of snacky snacks.
Where can I buy one of those?
That is the weirdest monkey I've ever seen. Nature always surprises me
Your child could use a haircut
Gonna tell my kids this is an Ewok
Pretty sure that’s just my toddler in a monkey costume.
This is one awesome ape.
He looks so much like a 3d animation
Its color is very cool and very cheerful
He looks like a filter
If this is real, can someone tell me what is its scientific name?
Wow pretty cute
I'm convinced that's a small human in a furry costume
This dude a legit cartoon I swear
This thing looks like it reaps souls
What the fxck is that and why isn't it in my house
This is the only thing I'd sell GME shares for.
I want to hug that little monke fella so freaking bad
Yo give me comments for this karma ish
Wow I thought it was fake at first
I've got a furry beer belly ..so what..!
He seems like a good guy.
Ewoks are real?
I could watch this monkey eat until he exploded
I feel like if you put him in a hood he’d be a Jawa
[deleted]
Monke need fööd
Is that a Pokemon?
That Ewok needs some treats.  Chibcha, chuba juwana.
Is it just me or does that look like a kid in a monkey suit?
WHAT KIND OF FUCKING MONKEY IS THAT?
I don't know if I'm really stone, but this monkey almost looks CGI
Dude imagine it being able to talk. Lol
Looks like my 2 yr old on Halloween
You got any games on your phone?
Newest Star Wars character
What kinda ape is that why the fuck have I never seen this thing before
Now go steal the alethiometer!
You can’t fool me with cuteness I bet Mrs Coulter is round the corner somewhere
As they say, reality is often stranger than fiction. 

I thought they were CGI at first with how...well cartoony? It looked.
Wow, first time I've ever seen this animal. It almost doesn't look real. So freaking cool!
That's a hell of a costume lol
This thing doesn't look real. I actually thought this was a 3D model or something.
My son whenever I have candy
That thing looks like it would punch you in the balls if you didn’t give him more snacks.
Beast Titan
That is the cutest fuckin breed of Primate ive ever seen. What is it? LOL. It looks like one of those plush toy key chains or an Ewok
I want to give this animal a hug
Mrs Coulter must be near
First rule with monkeys: never feed them.

For them it's like you give them food because they are superior and you are just a subject. That's why they become aggressive after that.
Is that a fucking LORAX?!?
I like that fella
Now, try to get away from him.
Furries these days are getting out of hand.
That’s a Pokémon
Thaaaa fuck is that thing!
Holy shit Ewoks ARE real
Amazing cosplay. /s
Do you want to develop an app?
Um, Im sorry, WTF is this anthropomorphic teddy bear?
Is that a kid in a monkey suit?
ITS SO CUTE
Moon Baboon!
He reminds me of my three year old ginger nephew
The Lorax!
bro i thought this was cgi wtf
What pokemon is that?
If that monkey isn't named Danny Devito I'm going to be disappointed
He looks so soft :0
Wanna take down a base in the woods while my brother saves my dad?
Looks like a friendly npc from a distant planet in a videogame.
Gotta Love such an absolutely gorgeous, precious soul!
Why does this animal look like a human child in an animal costume?
I want to fucking hug THAT MONKEY 😍
It don't look real
This guy looks like the animal kingdom version of Frank Reynolds
Yooooo that thing is awesome!!! Almost looks fake
I thought this was AR at first lol
The Beast Titan doesn’t look so intimidating in person
I have no idea what that monkey creature is but his face reminds me of Homer Simpson and I want one. ❤️
I would be afraid to stop giving that monkey summa dat

u/BrkoNostalgia
Sorry but no, that is r/goddamnfrightening and looks like it would bite you if you refused to keep handing it snacks.
This thing isn’t even real that’s a made up monkey
This is a Pokemon and I will not be told different.
I can haz monkey
Omg what is this adorable creatureeeeee? Eeeeeeee I am giddy, too cute
Whose that pokemon?
I think this is my daughter
That’s a fucking pokemon
Apes strong together💪🦍💎🤲🚀🌑
*“Ugh, I can actually hear you getting fatter.”*
Cute but this is exceptionally dangerous. This is a wild animal capable of fucking you up.
Monke
Two thoughts cross my mind watching this for a while:

Being nice to it handing it food and randomly aggressively pushing it to see the reaction

Holding up a hand for a high five but I worry any movement other than calmly giving it food would result in limb dismemberment
I’m annoyed that anyone could insist on not believing in miracles when we have goofy pals like this hidden all over the planet
this is Danny Devito and you can't convince me it's not.
That's a Pokémon and you cannot convince me otherwise
Dont feed them.
This monkey later mobbed a child because it didnt get treats...dont feed wild animals
This little guy is known as a golden snub nosed monkey.
This is the intelligent Kardashian and less hairy.
I would want to hug it and give them all the snacks. I’d go broke giving them all the snacks.
Does it want a hug or does it just keep gesturing "wtf give me more dude"? So damn cute.
Yo what?! You’re telling me this isn’t cgi?
That is the best kids Halloween costume EVER! So realistic!😂
Mom said you had to share your fries
That thing doesn’t look real lmao

Human chewing sounds: excruciatingly annoying     
          
Animal chewing sounds: fucking adorable
Idk what that is but I wanna hug it so badly
For some reason it doesn't look real
Remember when that lady got her face ripped off by a wild chimpanzee and everyone chastised her for even trying to interact with nature? 

Lol yah, double standards when something ends up being “cute”

Although that kinda “hey was that it?!” Is adorable.
TIL that Ewoks DO exist!
It looks like it will be pissed when you don't have more to give
That’s the bro-est monkey I’ve ever seen

Kind of reminds me of the fall guys lol
Which Care Bear is this? Wrong answers only.
Love the way he holds his arms up when he wants more
What even is that?
This is terrible actually. Training the monkey that if it harasses people, it will get food. What do you think happens to other people if they don't have food? What happens if that other person is a kid? This is a disaster waiting to happen

Now imagine a 10' tall version of that dude coming at you wanting food.
ohhhhh so cute
He looks like a fictional dianey character, whats the species name ?

These guys are supposed to live in the mountains. They’re endangered. This is clearly someone’s pet and the guy paid for snacks to give to him. This isn’t cute. This is exploitation.

Ewok’s are real 🥺
What is that animal?
He keeps coming in for the hug only to get fed again.
Endless loop?
Whatever it is, I would give it food all day long!
I kept thinking he was opening his arms for a hug to say thank you but then he just took another snack each time :p
This looks like a child in a stuffed animal costume. Sometimes animals are creepy in how humanlike they are.
Oh my god I love how cute this is. What the fuck is it?!
