‚ÄúStill awaiting my uniform, sir!‚Äù
I think the best part is he‚Äôs so cute the dudes have completely lost focus and are just like ‚Äúdawww!‚Äù
Private Mittens: ‚ÄúMeow‚Äù

Drill Sergeant: ‚ÄúWHO THE FUCK SAID THAT?!?‚Äù
We had a cat in formation in front of the barracks one time, a stray that hung around the crowd. We got called to fall in and the cat just sat (like this one) in between two soldiers and just looked around. 

The platoon sergeant walked up and yelled ‚Äúget out of my formation‚Äù at the cat, everyone chuckled and the cat just looked at him with big eyes. 

The guy standing behind the cat then kicks it lightly with his foot and shoos it and the platoon sergeant flipped his shit on him for ‚Äúabusing animals in his formation‚Äù. I think he even got an extra duty for it. Fun times.
"Aaaaaaaagh! That‚Äôs a  
war face.  
Now let me see your war face!"

"mreow"
since he has no uniform he's a real r/IllegallySmolCats
He's standing at attention better than most of those grunts

Medal of Honor recipient Cpl. Mittens. For his valiant actions when he braved heavy enemy machine gun fire to slay an enemy mouse and bring it to his sergeant. Brave Cpl. Mittens then turned sideways to the enemy, arched his back, and puffed up his tail and back fur, scattering the enemy and allowing his company to advance.
just as i've feared.. other countries have already developed super soldiers
He looks ready to go on pawtrol.
Well I‚Äôm just glad he‚Äôs treating the situation with the seriousness it deserves

That guy behind it looks so happy
Is that guy on the far left 'wearing' a chair?
real men love kitties
Hope he don‚Äôt get PTSD from the service, you ever seen a mouse take its last breath? Changes you man.
All I see is an empty room with a cat?
Any info about the camo pattern? Im curious

This country‚Äôs finest soldier

Private B. Smol, sir!

Cat: I hope this is the line for food.
"Repurrting fur duty!"
And all of a sudden there is a surge in things being pushed off the edge of the table at gunpoint
I like that the end of the line isn‚Äôt even trying to hold it together. Everyone is cheesing for the kitty.

Sgt: "Ah, now *this* is a model soldier!"  


Also Sgt (when no one's looking): *strokes and cuddles sweet kitty* "Who's a good soldier? You are! Yes, you are!"
Private Mittens is the only one with any military bearing
That guy without a belt is fucked tho
Sergeant: "WHICH ONE OF YOU MOTHERFUCKERS TOOK A SHIT IN NY BOOTS?!"

Everyone else can run 10 miles. You, you get scritches!!
Today has been a rough day. I needed this. Instant smile. Thank you.

Why are there so many shoes on the floor?
I want context
WTF. WHY AREN'T THEY ALL AT ATTENTION?!

Nice platoon you go there. Be a shame if it got knocked off the table.
Hey, who put the cat in charge?
Cats understand war
Show me your warface!



Meow?


YOUR WARFACE! AHHHHHH



MEOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW
Purrrrfect formation
This little one is serious and he is just waiting for orders by their commander.
Cutest pic ever. On a serious note, look how relaxed everyone is looking due to the kitten.
Mittens knows how to keep eye forward!

Rest of them need a code red
PFC Mittens
Are you a good boy?

Yes sir
Hes trying so hard to
*I'm doing my part, too!*
The best soldier! 

He protecc

He attacc

But most importantly he cute as fucc
My dad was a jump instructor in the 11th Airborne back during the Korean War. He did a "refresher" in Japan and they jumped low. Sometimes a guy would freeze, he'd be really nice, pull him back and say "No problem, next jump you'll be ready to jump without thinking."

They get back to the barracks and he commands the freezer to run up and down the beach in only skivvies, flapping his arms like a bird, and yelling at the top of his lungs, "I'm a Goonie Bird! I'm a Goonie Bird!" Until they pass out. Next jump, out they go as fast as they can!

One guy attracted a local stray dog while doing this and it ran back and forth with him until he dropped. Then it laid down next to him and followed the guy being carried by MPs back to camp and crawled into the barracks, laying down next to his bed. My Dad is a dog lover still at 90 yrs old. He let the dog sleep there until they were shipped out to Korea and he stayed back for the next group. He adopted the dog and told the "Boot pluffer" to be " the nastiest SOB in Korea, survive and come take this damned dog off my hands!"

GI lives, comes back through Hokkaido on his way back, picks up the dog and my Dad had already got it approved and cleared in San Francisco.
Is this real Military?  That formation looks like ass
Just fucking look at him he‚Äôs such a good boy
Awaiting inspection SIR!
Reminds me of [Munro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNgiWU9LY7A)

The fact he is perfectly in line with the rest of the guys and at "attention" is too damn adorable!
Let‚Äôs get down to business, to defeat the hounds
Everybody gangsta 'till the cats have demon eyes
You get a special medal for exemplary cuteness and cuddles in the line of duty which is being adorable.
Zero military bearing here
Puss and Boots
I know this is a cat but for anybody interested there was a sergeant stubby who was a dog which was a stray and eventually was in several battles and saved almost a full town by warning them of a gas attack. I‚Äôm probably off on a few details but it‚Äôs a superb story I think Disney made a film about him but failing all else have a look on google
private mittens gets sent to the hague for war crimes
WHO THE HEC DOWNVOTES THIS
r/catswithjobs
Nice

They can‚Äôt keep a straight face.
Ok but who‚Äôs the orange cat?
Pvt? That's *General* Mittens to you, soldiers!
Upturn his bunk!
time for vibe checks
You know if you think about it, it‚Äôs not unlikely that that Cat is the only one in that room that has actually killed anything with it‚Äôs bare hands/paws.
Those muddy pants ain't passing inspection
[Does Mittens' breath smell like cat food?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7Mgeh5D7TU)
Those cadets need to learn how to properly toe the line
Lazy piece of shit won‚Äôt even stand for attention like his comrades. Hope he fails. 

10/10 would pet anyway.
‚ÄúHow tall are you private!?‚Äù
‚Äú6 inches, sir!‚Äù
‚ÄúI knew they stacked shit that high!‚Äù

Finally, some wholesome stuff
The country is safe with those paws on duty.
"Get in that front leaning rest position for not being in proper uniform, Private, and do some pushu-ps! Right *meow*!"
If this happened in Marine bootcamp, and soldiers laughed, how would the DS react?
At ease private
Looks like this guy won‚Äôt be getting past their fuzzies

Why is such a soldier called mittens?

It's a trap. Cat has stripes so cat is a Sergeant doing a surprise inspection.
The cats the only one there with proper military bearing!
I love itüòªüëèüèº
‚ÄúBoys I have not seen a group this pathetic in my entire life. You boys think you could go to war? You couldn‚Äôt stop a Popeyes from descending into anarchy. I wouldn‚Äôt send you to the front lines of McDonald‚Äôs at lunch rush. I-‚Äú

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right Pvt. Mittens these boys should be Santa‚Äôs elves not America‚Äôs soldiers. The 2 month old cat that hasn‚Äôt even learned to lick its own ass has better opinions than you fucks.‚Äù

Is it just me or does Private Mohawk have a thunderous glare
Private mittens' litterbox is instantly declared chemical warfare and a war crime.  The jury is still out however as Private Mittens decimated both sides indiscriminately.

Plot Twist: the cat is secretly your new Drill Sargent, baiting you all into messing around/not staying in formation
Where is he going? Vietnam. He has been drafted.
They all love him omg

I had an idea for a store. We would sell super high quality mittens in many fashinable designs. It would be called "From Kittens to Mittens!". We would have a stereo in the backroom playing a recording on a loop of cats meowing just to keep the clientele guessing.
Hims stand tall and proud.
When the cat has better military bearing than you.
Puss in boots - where are your BOOTS maggot!
Yo what's the story behind this??
Nearly had tears from cute
Corporal Kitty is adorable!
Ah time for the ‚Äúcute test‚Äù
I think this one have to wear his uniform too.
A kitten with a gun would be a cat-astrophe
Reminds me of something a sergeant said to me and my roommates when we had a spider. 
"Either that spider and 'his bed' is gone by tomorrow, or one of you people leave. There's only room for 4 and if he doesn't go, then one of you is giving up their uniform"
I knew I should've joined the meowiltary.
